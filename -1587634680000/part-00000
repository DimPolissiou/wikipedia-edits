In episode 4 of ''The Mysterious Planet'' it is stated that \"valeyard\" means \"learned court prosecutor\" in their language, although the term is obsolete and highly obscure.\n\nDuring the course of the trial, the [[Doctor (Doctor Who)|Doctor]] was accused of \"conduct unbecoming a Time Lord\" and transgressing the First Law of Time. As prosecutor, the Valeyard presented the events of ''[[The Mysterious Planet]]'' and ''[[Mindwarp]]'' as extracts from the [[Matrix (Doctor Who)|Matrix]], the computer network that serves as the repository of all Time Lord knowledge. The Valeyard used these extracts as evidence of the Doctor's meddling in time and space. Throughout the presentation of the evidence the Doctor barked at the Valeyard, calling him names such as \"the Boneyard,\" \"the Scrapyard,\" and \"the [[Knacker]]'s Yard,\" and only the interventions of the [[Inquisitor (Doctor Who)|Inquisitor]], another Time Lord, kept the trial going.\n\nWhat was not discovered until later was that the Matrix extracts had been tampered with to show the Doctor in the worst possible light. The Doctor was unable to directly contradict some of the actions shown, as his extraction from time had disoriented his memory. In ''The Mysterious Planet'' this involved the editing of particular scenes. Scenes of the mercenary [[Sabalom Glitz]] attempting to buy \"secrets\" from the robot Drathro were censored completely. In ''Mindwarp'' substantial portions of the extract were falsified entirely by the Valeyard. The most significant alteration was when the Time Lords intervened in the brain transplant experiments of Lord Kiv and his scientist Crozier. In the Matrix extract, it appeared that Yrcanos was maneuvered into killing the Mentors after Kiv's mind had been transplanted into the body of the Doctor's [[companion (Doctor Who)|companion]] [[Peri Brown|Peri]] \u2013 the Doctor having apparently abandoned Peri to save himself after exposure to one of the machines in the lab temporarily altered his personality \u2013 effectively killing her.\n\nWhen the Doctor presented in his defence the future events of ''[[Terror of the Vervoids]]'', he began to suspect that the Valeyard was tampering with the evidence \u2013 having reviewed the evidence before presenting it and noting some differences between what he had witnessed then and what was now being displayed \u2013 but lacked proof. The Doctor was shown being forced to destroy the human-plant hybrids known as the Vervoids when they ran rampant on a space liner. If they had been allowed to reach Earth, they would have eliminated all animal life. The Valeyard argued that this meant the Doctor had committed [[genocide]].\n\nIn ''[[The Ultimate Foe]]'', the [[Master (Doctor Who)|Master]] appeared in the Matrix, revealing that it was possible to infiltrate it. Sabalom Glitz and the Doctor's future companion [[Melanie Bush]] were presented to the Court to rebut the Valeyard's accusations. It was then revealed by the Master that the Valeyard was, in fact, the Doctor himself \u2013 or rather, an amalgamation of the darker sides of the Doctor's nature, from somewhere between his twelfth and final incarnations. This concept is similar to the ethereal \"[[Watcher (Doctor Who)|Watcher]]\" that manifested itself to bridge the gap between the Doctor's [[Fourth Doctor|fourth]] and [[Fifth Doctor|fifth]] incarnations (''[[Logopolis]]'').  However, in the novelisation of the story the Master states \"The Valeyard, Doctor, is your ''penultimate reincarnation''... Somewhere between your twelfth and thirteenth ''regeneration''\".\n\nThe Valeyard was also revealed to be acting at the behest of the High Council of Time Lords to cover its corruption in the [[The Mysterious Planet|Ravalox affair]]. The \"secrets\" that Glitz had been seeking were information from the Matrix. Ravalox was Earth in approximately 2,000,000 AD, but the Time Lords moved it through space, killing virtually every human being living on it. To prevent the Doctor discovering the secret and revealing it, they used the Valeyard to try to have the Doctor executed under the pretence of a trial. The reward for the Valeyard's actions would have been to give him all of the Doctor's remaining regenerations and make his existence concrete. However, the Valeyard would then have slain every member of the Court as well, using a particle disseminator located within the Matrix.\n\nThe Doctor entered the Matrix and fought and defeated the Valeyard in a fictional world of his creation. The Inquisitor revealed that Peri had indeed survived and was married to Yrcanos. The Master and the Valeyard appeared to be trapped in the Matrix, with the Valeyard apparently being destroyed by the feedback from the particle disseminator, but at the end of the serial, the Valeyard was seen disguised as the Keeper of the Matrix. The subsequent whereabouts of the Valeyard have never been disclosed in the television series.\n\nIn the 2013 episode \"[[The Name of the Doctor]]\", the [[Great Intelligence]] states that \"Valeyard\" is one of the names by which the Doctor will be known before the end of his life.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bleedingcool.com/2013/05/18/eleven-thoughts-about-doctor-who/|title=Ten Thoughts About Doctor Who: The Name Of The Doctor|last=Johnston|first=Rich|work=bleedingcool.com|date=18 May 2013|accessdate=19 May 2013}}</ref> In the 2017 episode \"[[Twice Upon a Time (Doctor Who)|Twice Upon a Time]]\", the entity Testimony tells the [[First Doctor]] that one of his future titles is \"the Shadow of the Valeyard\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.denofgeek.com/uk/tv/twice-upon-a-time/54180/doctor-who-geeky-spots-references-in-twice-upon-a-time|title=Doctor Who: geeky spots & references in Twice Upon A Time|publisher=[[Den of Geek]]|last=Dillon-Trenchard|first=Pete|date=25 December 2017|accessdate=25 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n===In other media===\nThe Valeyard has appeared in some of the [[Doctor Who spin-offs|spin-off]] media. In these stories, the Doctor is aware that he has the potential to become the Valeyard and tries to step away from any path that might lead him to that future. In the [[Virgin Publishing]] Missing Adventure ''[[Millennial Rites]]'' by Craig Hinton, the Sixth Doctor succumbed to his darker side and became the Valeyard very briefly due to reality being destabilised by three competing laws of physics being concentrated in one place, allowing the dormant potential of the Valeyard within the Doctor to take control of his body, but the Doctor's true persona was able to regain control when he nearly killed an innocent child. In a confrontation with the Valeyard in his mind, the Doctor accepted the Valeyard's argument that the more ruthless course of action could sometimes be necessary, but rejected the Valeyard's belief that he had to enjoy such actions to commit them.\n\nThroughout the New Adventures, the [[Seventh Doctor]] is tormented by the knowledge that he might become the Valeyard, with it being implied that his potential presence in the Doctor's mind drove the Sixth Doctor to commit \"suicide\" by allowing the TARDIS to be caught in the [[Rani (Doctor Who)|Rani]]'s tractor beam. With this revelation, the memory of the Sixth Doctor becomes increasingly associated with the Valeyard in the Seventh Doctor's mind, causing the past five Doctors \u2013 each one based on the present Doctor's memories of what they were like \u2013 to \"lock\" the Sixth Doctor's memory away for fear of what he might become. However, in ''[[The Room with No Doors]]'', the Doctor learns to forgive himself for his past sins, removing the guilt that would have led to the Valeyard's creation and freeing the Sixth Doctor from the room as the Seventh accepts the Sixth Doctor as part of himself rather than focusing on his predecessor's flaws.\n\nIn the [[BBC Books]] novel ''[[The Eight Doctors]]'', by [[Terrance Dicks]], the [[Eighth Doctor]] returns to the trial of the Sixth Doctor and rescues him from an alternative timeline in which the Sixth Doctor is about to be executed by the Valeyard before Mel and Glitz's arrival, the Eighth Doctor denouncing the charge of genocide as ludicrous due to the Vervoids having been artificially created rather than a naturally-evolving species. The Master reinforces the statement made in ''[[The Ultimate Foe]]'' to the Eighth Doctor\u2014that the Valeyard is \"an amalgam of the Doctor's darker side, somewhere between his twelfth and thirteenth regenerations.\"  This combined with the information from ''[[The Twin Dilemma]]'' reinforces the idea that the Valeyard is indeed the Doctor's thirteenth and last \"normal\" incarnation. While the Sixth Doctor faces the Valeyard, the Eighth Doctor arranges for a restored [[Borusa]] to lead a committee of inquiry into the events that led to the Valeyard's creation and the Sixth Doctor's trial, but the crisis concludes with the Valeyard's apparent disappearance before the Eighth and Sixth Doctors resume their travels.\n\nIn the ''[[Past Doctor Adventures]]'' novel ''[[Mission: Impractical]]'' by [[David A. McIntee]], the villainous Mr Zimmerman, a renegade Time Lord who had hired two assassins to kill the Doctor, refers to the Sixth Doctor as \"I\" before correcting himself. McIntee has confirmed that this is a subtle hint that Zimmerman was actually the Valeyard.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gallifreyone.com/forum/showpost.php?p=2482447&postcount=11|title=Outpost Gallifrey forum thread}}{{dead link|date=February 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn ''[[Matrix (Doctor Who novel)|Matrix]]'' by [[Robert Perry (writer)|Robert Perry]] and [[Mike Tucker]], the Valeyard again appears, and encounters the [[Seventh Doctor]]. After possessing the body of the Keeper, he acquires control over the Dark Matrix, the repository of all of the Time Lords' most evil impulses, and tries to use it to take revenge on the Doctor. To this end, he travels to London in 1888, taking on the identity of [[Jack the Ripper]], and using the Ripper murders as sacrifices to power the Dark Matrix, believing that he can use and control the Matrix to grant himself a true existence independent of the Doctor. Once it has enough power, the Dark Matrix will be unleashed on the world, creating a [[dystopia]]n nightmare and corrupting history forever. As an added bonus, the Valeyard has tracked down all thirteen incarnations of the Doctor, using the influence of the Dark Matrix to corrupt each Doctor into dark and twisted versions of themselves (notably resulting in the [[First Doctor]] murdering other Time Lords during his escape from Gallifrey, the [[Fourth Doctor]] [[Genesis of the Daleks|destroying the Daleks at their creation]], and the [[Fifth Doctor]] [[The Caves of Androzani|using bat's milk to cure himself from spectrox poisoning]] while leaving Peri to succumb to the toxin in his place), using their corrupted spirits to animate [[golem]]s to do his work. However, the Seventh Doctor escapes the Valeyard's attack by sealing his conscious mind away from the assault in the TARDIS telepathic circuits, although this briefly leaves him as nothing more than an amnesic cardsharp who calls himself \"Johnny\". Having regained his memory after retrieving the circuits, the Doctor confronts the Valeyard (now calling himself \"the Ripper\" on the grounds that the name is more evocative) in a church where the Ripper has left his TARDIS, now reprogrammed into the appearance of the Doctor's tomb, causing his foe to lose control of the Dark Matrix, provoking it by revealing that the Dark Matrix is just as trapped under the Valeyard's control as it was on Gallifrey. The Valeyard is eventually killed by a lightning bolt being generated by his damaged [[TARDIS]] as it collapses while the Dark Matrix tries to escape, his body disappearing as the spirits of the other twelve Doctors seemingly depart in spectral versions of the TARDIS around the Seventh, and history is restored to normal.\n\nA novel from the late ''Doctor Who'' author [[Craig Hinton]], ''[[Time's Champion]]'', was to have featured the Valeyard once again alongside the sixth incarnation of the Doctor. Connecting plot lines from the Virgin novels' New and Missing Adventures range, the narrative centred upon the circumstances involving the sixth Doctor's regeneration and also the purpose and origins of the Valeyard.   A synopsis of the novel was rejected by BBC Books (who published another novel dealing with the Sixth Doctor's regeneration, ''[[Spiral Scratch (Doctor Who)|Spiral Scratch]]'', around the same time).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/news/cult/news/drwho/2004/06/01/13201.shtml |title=Interview: Craig Hinton |accessdate=21 August 2008 |date=1 June 2004 |work=Doctor Who website |publisher=[[bbc.co.uk]]}}</ref> According to Hinton's friend and co-writer Chris McKeon, this compelled McKeon to begin working on an unofficial publication of the book, based in part on the six chapter synopsis (and including the three pages of text) Hinton had completed. McKeon would go on to complete the novel upon Hinton's death. The novel was edited and published by [[David J. Howe]] as a benefit for the [[British Heart Foundation]].<ref name=\"dreamwatch\">{{cite web |url=http://www.dwscifi.com/reviews/2321-time-s-champion |title=Time's Champion Review |accessdate=21 August 2008 |last=Wilkins |first=Jonathan |date=7 August 2008 |work=Total Sci Fi |publisher=[[Dreamwatch]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080810093936/http://www.dwscifi.com/reviews/2321-time-s-champion|archivedate=10 August 2008 }}</ref>\n\nThe [[Big Finish Productions]]' ''[[Doctor Who Unbound]]'' [[List of Doctor Who audio plays by Big Finish|audio drama]] ''[[He Jests at Scars...]]'' documents an alternative timeline in which the Valeyard, once again voiced by Michael Jayston, has defeated the Doctor (in the aftermath of the trial) and gone on to ransack time and space. He has forged an empire by carefully eliminating time sensitives and altering his own (i.e. the Doctor's) past to his advantage, monopolising time travel and claiming the various doomsday weapons the Doctor left buried and concealed for his own use. The Doctor's companion Mel, hardened by many years of dark experience, eventually tracks him down with a view to assassinating the Valeyard after confirming that there is nothing of the Doctor left in him, but finds that he has become the victim of his own time meddling, the Valeyard himself acknowledging that he lacked the Doctor's compassion and ability to acknowledge when ''not'' to do something, so eager to act that he never truly stopped to consider the consequences of doing so in the belief that he could just go back and restore events later. Eventually, the Valeyard's actions begin to twist his own personal history, such as accidentally killing the [[Fourth Doctor]], or planning to kill the [[First Doctor]]'s companion [[Dodo Chaplet]] to stop the Doctor visiting a planet for a holiday at the same time as the Valeyard destroyed it, with the result that most of his 'empire' was actually an illusion; in reality, the Valeyard had trapped himself inside the TARDIS, terrified even to move in case he makes things worse. When the TARDIS runs out of power, the illusions it has created break down, leaving the Valeyard and Mel trapped in the console room floating in the heart of the Time Vortex, the stasis fields only able to allow them to talk but running out of the power necessary to permit even that. Mel and a seemingly repentant, broken Valeyard suffer the penalty for breaking the Time Lords' first law, and become trapped in the TARDIS, perhaps forever enmeshed in the centre of the web of time until the necessary millennia have elapsed for reality to recover from the damage the Valeyard had done to it.\n\nThe [[IDW Publishing|IDW]] ''Doctor Who'' comic series ''The Forgotten'' written by [[Tony Lee]] featured another individual calling himself \"The Valeyard\", who claimed to be the Meta-Crisis Doctor, but this was revealed to be a disguise taken by a cranial parasite while it and the [[Tenth Doctor]] were trapped in the TARDIS' matrix.\n\n''The Time Traveller's Companion'', a supplement for the ''[[Doctor Who \u2013 Adventures in Time and Space: The Roleplaying Game]]'', implies that the Valeyard is a rogue Watcher, similar to the one produced in ''[[Logopolis]]'', generated during the regeneration of the Twelfth Doctor into the Thirteenth. This Watcher, presumed to possess all the most negative traits of the Doctor's darker nature, refused to rejoin with the Time Lord and escaped into the wider universe to eventually put the Doctor on trial.\n\nAnother Big Finish audio, ''[[Trial of the Valeyard]]'', has the Valeyard captured and put on trial by the Time Lords, but he requests that the Sixth Doctor act as his defence, provoking the Doctor into accepting the deal by offering to tell the Doctor about his origins. The Valeyard claims he was created on a planet orbiting Eta Rho by the Thirteenth Doctor, who was experimenting with ways to break the regeneration limit. He is able to escape through the Matrix, retreating to Eta Rho and attempting to kill the Doctor with a bomb disguised as the 'Black Scrolls' of the Doctor's future self, the Valeyard posing as a senile old man who was apparently the Thirteenth Doctor. The Doctor sees through the deception and the Valeyard escapes again, leaving the Doctor to contemplate that the Valeyard may have included some truth in his story even if he denounces the overall picture as a lie.\n\nIn the audio ''[[The Sixth Doctor: The Last Adventure]]'', the Valeyard masterminds a complex plot to infect the TARDIS with an alien intelligence that will allow him to subvert the Doctor and take control of his body while drawing on the Doctor's own negative emotional energy to restore himself. This plan brings him in contact with the Sixth Doctor at various points in his life, the Valeyard restoring his energy in an encounter in a pocket universe while the Doctor is travelling with Constance Clarke (''End of the Line''), stealing a crucial piece of equipment on a planet inhabited by 'werewolves' while the Doctor is with [[Charley Pollard]] (''The Red House''), and gaining new energy in a confrontation in Victorian London with the Doctor, [[Flip Jackson]], Professor Litefoot, and Henry Gordon Jago (''Stage Fright''). Although the Valeyard's plan succeeds in allowing him to essentially 'transplant' himself over the Doctor's timeline with the goal that he will then spread throughout the Matrix and replace all other Time Lords, the remnants of the Doctor's psyche in the Matrix after his 'death' are able to undo the Valeyard's attack by reaching back into his past and prompting his past self to set a course that will expose the TARDIS to a dangerous form of radiation, causing the Sixth Doctor to regenerate and thus purging his body of the Valeyard's influence, leaving his foe trapped in the Matrix as his victory is erased (''The Brink of Death'').\n\nThe Valeyard returns in the third volume of ''The Time War'', chronicling the [[Eighth Doctor]]'s experiences during the [[Time War (Doctor Who)|Time War]], when the Valeyard returns to existence as the Time Lords attempt to recruit him to act for their side in the War.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bigfinish.com/releases/v/doctor-who-time-war-3-1675|title=3. Doctor Who: Time War 3 - Doctor Who - The Eighth Doctor Adventures - Big Finish|website=www.bigfinish.com}}</ref> As explained in the audio ''The War Valeyard'', rather than coming from the Doctor's future, this version of the Valeyard is 'extracted' from the Doctor when he used a transmat after assisting another Time Lord on a mission involving exposure to a device that could manipulate biology, with the Time Lords deciding to utilise the Valeyard as a soldier in the Time War as he retains the Doctor's guile and intelligence without his morality, willing to carry out missions that would endanger planets and civilians that the Doctor would reject. Eventually, the Time Lords sent the new Valeyard to investigate a Dalek weapon that is supposedly capable of erasing the Time Lords from history. However, when the Valeyard attempts to turn the weapon on the Daleks, the Time Lords are forced to trap the planet in a time loop where the Valeyard comes to believe that he is the Doctor, fighting the illusionary Daleks created by the weapon's destruction. The Eighth Doctor briefly penetrates the time loop to investigate the Valeyard's existence, but accepts the Valeyard's request to remain on that world so that his other self can continue to believe he is the Doctor fighting the Daleks in a simpler conflict.\n\n==List of appearances==\n\n===Television===\n*''[[The Mysterious Planet]]\n*''[[Mindwarp]]\n*''[[Terror of the Vervoids]]\n*''[[The Ultimate Foe]]\n\n===Novels===\n*''[[Mission: Impractical]]'' (behind the scenes; does not explicitly appear)\n*''[[Millennial Rites]]'' (his dormant potential manifests from the Sixth Doctor, although his words imply that the 'true' Valeyard is involved)\n*''[[Time's Champion]]'' (non-canon novel)\n*''[[Matrix (novel)|Matrix]]'' (faces the Seventh Doctor while acting as [[Jack the Ripper]]; traps wraiths based on corrupted versions of the other twelve Doctors)\n*''[[The Eight Doctors]]'' (briefly appears in the Sixth Doctor's era, but does not meet the Eighth Doctor directly)\n\n===Audio Drama===\n*''[[He Jests at Scars...]]'' (alternate timeline where the Valeyard defeated the Doctor and destroyed the Web of Time)\n*''[[Trial of the Valeyard]]'' (captured by the Time Lords some time after the trial)\n*''[[The Sixth Doctor: The Last Adventure]]'' (appears across the Sixth Doctor's history collecting components for a new plan)\n*''The Eighth Doctor: The Time War 3- The War Valeyard'' (new version of the Valeyard manifesting from the Doctor travelling through a transmat device while holding a machine designed to manipulate the subject's genetic structure)\n\n==See also==\n*[[Twelfth Doctor]]\n*[[Thirteenth Doctor]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{TardisIndexFile|The Valeyard|Valeyard}}\n\n{{Doctor Who navbox}}\n{{Valeyard stories}}\n{{Doctor Who villains}}\n{{Doctor Who}}\n\n[[Category:Doctor Who audio characters]]\n[[Category:Doctor Who Doctors]]\n[[Category:Television characters introduced in 1986]]\n[[Category:Male characters in television]]\n[[Category:Recurring characters in Doctor Who]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Fictional character of Doctor Who}}\n{{EngvarB|date=March 2016}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2016}}\n{{Infobox Doctor Who doctor \n| nth         = Valeyard \n| doc_image   = [[Image:Valeyard.jpg|270px]]\n| caption     = [[Michael Jayston]] as the Valeyard\n| series      = Doctor Who\n| affiliation = [[Time Lord]]s\n| race        = [[Time Lord|Gallifreyan]]\n| planet      = [[Gallifrey]]\n| era         = [[Rassilon|Rassilon Era]]\n| start       = ''[[The Trial of a Time Lord]]: [[The Mysterious Planet]]'' (1986)\n| finish      = ''The Trial of a Time Lord: [[The Ultimate Foe]]'' (1986)\n| no_stories  = 1\n| no_episodes = 14\n| portrayed   = [[Michael Jayston]]<br />[[Geoffrey Hughes]] {{small|(Popplewick disguise)}}\n}}\nThe '''Valeyard'''  ({{IPAc-en|\u02c8|v|\u00e6|l|i|\u0251\u02d0|d}}) is a fictional character from the long-running British [[science fiction on television|science fiction television]] series, ''[[Doctor Who]]''.

In these stories, the Doctor is aware that he has the potential to become the Valeyard and tries to step away from any path that might lead him to that future. In the [[Virgin Publishing]] Missing Adventure ''[[Millennial Rites]]'' by Craig Hinton, the Sixth Doctor succumbed to his darker side and became the Valeyard very briefly due to reality being destabilised by three competing laws of physics being concentrated in one place, allowing the dormant potential of the Valeyard within the Doctor to take control of his body, but the Doctor's true persona was able to regain control when he nearly killed an innocent child. In a confrontation with the Valeyard in his mind, the Doctor accepted the Valeyard's argument that the more ruthless course of action could sometimes be necessary, but rejected the Valeyard's belief that he had to enjoy such actions to commit them.\n\nThroughout the New Adventures, the [[Seventh Doctor]] is tormented by the knowledge that he might become the Valeyard, with it being implied that his potential presence in the Doctor's mind drove the Sixth Doctor to commit \"suicide\" by allowing the TARDIS to be caught in the [[Rani (Doctor Who)|Rani]]'s tractor beam. With this revelation, the memory of the Sixth Doctor becomes increasingly associated with the Valeyard in the Seventh Doctor's mind, causing the past five Doctors \u2013 each one based on the present Doctor's memories of what they were like \u2013 to \"lock\" the Sixth Doctor's memory away for fear of what he might become. However, in ''[[The Room with No Doors]]'', the Doctor learns to forgive himself for his past sins, removing the guilt that would have led to the Valeyard's creation and freeing the Sixth Doctor from the room as the Seventh accepts the Sixth Doctor as part of himself rather than focusing on his predecessor's flaws.\n\nIn the [[BBC Books]] novel ''[[The Eight Doctors]]'', by [[Terrance Dicks]], the [[Eighth Doctor]] returns to the trial of the Sixth Doctor and rescues him from an alternative timeline in which the Sixth Doctor is about to be executed by the Valeyard before Mel and Glitz's arrival, the Eighth Doctor denouncing the charge of genocide as ludicrous due to the Vervoids having been artificially created rather than a naturally-evolving species. The Master reinforces the statement made in ''[[The Ultimate Foe]]'' to the Eighth Doctor\u2014that the Valeyard is \"an amalgam of the Doctor's darker side, somewhere between his twelfth and thirteenth regenerations.\"  This combined with the information from ''[[The Twin Dilemma]]'' reinforces the idea that the Valeyard is indeed the Doctor's thirteenth and last \"normal\" incarnation. While the Sixth Doctor faces the Valeyard, the Eighth Doctor arranges for a restored [[Borusa]] to lead a committee of inquiry into the events that led to the Valeyard's creation and the Sixth Doctor's trial, but the crisis concludes with the Valeyard's apparent disappearance before the Eighth and Sixth Doctors resume their travels.\n\nIn the ''[[Past Doctor Adventures]]'' novel ''[[Mission: Impractical]]'' by [[David A. McIntee]], the villainous Mr Zimmerman, a renegade Time Lord who had hired two assassins to kill the Doctor, refers to the Sixth Doctor as \"I\" before correcting himself. McIntee has confirmed that this is a subtle hint that Zimmerman was actually the Valeyard.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gallifreyone.com/forum/showpost.php?p=2482447&postcount=11|title=Outpost Gallifrey forum thread}}{{dead link|date=February 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn ''[[Matrix (Doctor Who novel)|Matrix]]'' by [[Robert Perry (writer)|Robert Perry]] and [[Mike Tucker]], the Valeyard again appears, and encounters the [[Seventh Doctor]]. After possessing the body of the Keeper, he acquires control over the Dark Matrix, the repository of all of the Time Lords' most evil impulses, and tries to use it to take revenge on the Doctor. To this end, he travels to London in 1888, taking on the identity of [[Jack the Ripper]], and using the Ripper murders as sacrifices to power the Dark Matrix, believing that he can use and control the Matrix to grant himself a true existence independent of the Doctor. Once it has enough power, the Dark Matrix will be unleashed on the world, creating a [[dystopia]]n nightmare and corrupting history forever. As an added bonus, the Valeyard has tracked down all thirteen incarnations of the Doctor, using the influence of the Dark Matrix to corrupt each Doctor into dark and twisted versions of themselves (notably resulting in the [[First Doctor]] murdering other Time Lords during his escape from Gallifrey, the [[Fourth Doctor]] [[Genesis of the Daleks|destroying the Daleks at their creation]], and the [[Fifth Doctor]] [[The Caves of Androzani|using bat's milk to cure himself from spectrox poisoning]] while leaving Peri to succumb to the toxin in his place), using their corrupted spirits to animate [[golem]]s to do his work. However, the Seventh Doctor escapes the Valeyard's attack by sealing his conscious mind away from the assault in the TARDIS telepathic circuits, although this briefly leaves him as nothing more than an amnesic cardsharp who calls himself \"Johnny\". Having regained his memory after retrieving the circuits, the Doctor confronts the Valeyard (now calling himself \"the Ripper\" on the grounds that the name is more evocative) in a church where the Ripper has left his TARDIS, now reprogrammed into the appearance of the Doctor's tomb, causing his foe to lose control of the Dark Matrix, provoking it by revealing that the Dark Matrix is just as trapped under the Valeyard's control as it was on Gallifrey. The Valeyard is eventually killed by a lightning bolt being generated by his damaged [[TARDIS]] as it collapses while the Dark Matrix tries to escape, his body disappearing as the spirits of the other twelve Doctors seemingly depart in spectral versions of the TARDIS around the Seventh, and history is restored to normal.\n\nA novel from the late ''Doctor Who'' author [[Craig Hinton]], ''[[Time's Champion]]'', was to have featured the Valeyard once again alongside the sixth incarnation of the Doctor. Connecting plot lines from the Virgin novels' New and Missing Adventures range, the narrative centred upon the circumstances involving the sixth Doctor's regeneration and also the purpose and origins of the Valeyard.   A synopsis of the novel was rejected by BBC Books (who published another novel dealing with the Sixth Doctor's regeneration, ''[[Spiral Scratch (Doctor Who)|Spiral Scratch]]'', around the same time).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/news/cult/news/drwho/2004/06/01/13201.shtml |title=Interview: Craig Hinton |accessdate=21 August 2008 |date=1 June 2004 |work=Doctor Who website |publisher=[[bbc.co.uk]]}}</ref> According to Hinton's friend and co-writer Chris McKeon, this compelled McKeon to begin working on an unofficial publication of the book, based in part on the six chapter synopsis (and including the three pages of text) Hinton had completed. McKeon would go on to complete the novel upon Hinton's death. The novel was edited and published by [[David J. Howe]] as a benefit for the [[British Heart Foundation]].<ref name=\"dreamwatch\">{{cite web |url=http://www.dwscifi.com/reviews/2321-time-s-champion |title=Time's Champion Review |accessdate=21 August 2008 |last=Wilkins |first=Jonathan |date=7 August 2008 |work=Total Sci Fi |publisher=[[Dreamwatch]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080810093936/http://www.dwscifi.com/reviews/2321-time-s-champion|archivedate=10 August 2008 }}</ref>\n\nThe [[Big Finish Productions]]' ''[[Doctor Who Unbound]]'' [[List of Doctor Who audio plays by Big Finish|audio drama]] ''[[He Jests at Scars...]]'' documents an alternative timeline in which the Valeyard, once again voiced by Michael Jayston, has defeated the Doctor (in the aftermath of the trial) and gone on to ransack time and space. He has forged an empire by carefully eliminating time sensitives and altering his own (i.e. the Doctor's) past to his advantage, monopolising time travel and claiming the various doomsday weapons the Doctor left buried and concealed for his own use. The Doctor's companion Mel, hardened by many years of dark experience, eventually tracks him down with a view to assassinating the Valeyard after confirming that there is nothing of the Doctor left in him, but finds that he has become the victim of his own time meddling, the Valeyard himself acknowledging that he lacked the Doctor's compassion and ability to acknowledge when ''not'' to do something, so eager to act that he never truly stopped to consider the consequences of doing so in the belief that he could just go back and restore events later. Eventually, the Valeyard's actions begin to twist his own personal history, such as accidentally killing the [[Fourth Doctor]], or planning to kill the [[First Doctor]]'s companion [[Dodo Chaplet]] to stop the Doctor visiting a planet for a holiday at the same time as the Valeyard destroyed it, with the result that most of his 'empire' was actually an illusion; in reality, the Valeyard had trapped himself inside the TARDIS, terrified even to move in case he makes things worse. When the TARDIS runs out of power, the illusions it has created break down, leaving the Valeyard and Mel trapped in the console room floating in the heart of the Time Vortex, the stasis fields only able to allow them to talk but running out of the power necessary to permit even that. Mel and a seemingly repentant, broken Valeyard suffer the penalty for breaking the Time Lords' first law, and become trapped in the TARDIS, perhaps forever enmeshed in the centre of the web of time until the necessary millennia have elapsed for reality to recover from the damage the Valeyard had done to it.\n\nThe [[IDW Publishing|IDW]] ''Doctor Who'' comic series ''The Forgotten'' written by [[Tony Lee]] featured another individual calling himself \"The Valeyard\", who claimed to be the Meta-Crisis Doctor, but this was revealed to be a disguise taken by a cranial parasite while it and the [[Tenth Doctor]] were trapped in the TARDIS' matrix.\n\n''The Time Traveller's Companion'', a supplement for the ''[[Doctor Who \u2013 Adventures in Time and Space: The Roleplaying Game]]'', implies that the Valeyard is a rogue Watcher, similar to the one produced in ''[[Logopolis]]'', generated during the regeneration of the Twelfth Doctor into the Thirteenth. This Watcher, presumed to possess all the most negative traits of the Doctor's darker nature, refused to rejoin with the Time Lord and escaped into the wider universe to eventually put the Doctor on trial.\n\nAnother Big Finish audio, ''[[Trial of the Valeyard]]'', has the Valeyard captured and put on trial by the Time Lords, but he requests that the Sixth Doctor act as his defence, provoking the Doctor into accepting the deal by offering to tell the Doctor about his origins. The Valeyard claims he was created on a planet orbiting Eta Rho by the Thirteenth Doctor, who was experimenting with ways to break the regeneration limit. He is able to escape through the Matrix, retreating to Eta Rho and attempting to kill the Doctor with a bomb disguised as the 'Black Scrolls' of the Doctor's future self, the Valeyard posing as a senile old man who was apparently the Thirteenth Doctor. The Doctor sees through the deception and the Valeyard escapes again, leaving the Doctor to contemplate that the Valeyard may have included some truth in his story even if he denounces the overall picture as a lie.\n\nIn the audio ''[[The Sixth Doctor: The Last Adventure]]'', the Valeyard masterminds a complex plot to infect the TARDIS with an alien intelligence that will allow him to subvert the Doctor and take control of his body while drawing on the Doctor's own negative emotional energy to restore himself. This plan brings him in contact with the Sixth Doctor at various points in his life, the Valeyard restoring his energy in an encounter in a pocket universe while the Doctor is travelling with Constance Clarke (''End of the Line''), stealing a crucial piece of equipment on a planet inhabited by 'werewolves' while the Doctor is with [[Charley Pollard]] (''The Red House''), and gaining new energy in a confrontation in Victorian London with the Doctor, [[Flip Jackson]], Professor Litefoot, and Henry Gordon Jago (''Stage Fright''). Although the Valeyard's plan succeeds in allowing him to essentially 'transplant' himself over the Doctor's timeline with the goal that he will then spread throughout the Matrix and replace all other Time Lords, the remnants of the Doctor's psyche in the Matrix after his 'death' are able to undo the Valeyard's attack by reaching back into his past and prompting his past self to set a course that will expose the TARDIS to a dangerous form of radiation, causing the Sixth Doctor to regenerate and thus purging his body of the Valeyard's influence, leaving his foe trapped in the Matrix as his victory is erased (''The Brink of Death'').\n\nThe Valeyard returns in the third volume of ''The Time War'', chronicling the [[Eighth Doctor]]'s experiences during the [[Time War (Doctor Who)|Time War]], when the Valeyard returns to existence as the Time Lords attempt to recruit him to act for their side in the War.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bigfinish.com/releases/v/doctor-who-time-war-3-1675|title=3. Doctor Who: Time War 3 - Doctor Who - The Eighth Doctor Adventures - Big Finish|website=www.bigfinish.com}}</ref> As explained in the audio ''The War Valeyard'', rather than coming from the Doctor's future, this version of the Valeyard is 'extracted' from the Doctor when he used a transmat after assisting another Time Lord on a mission involving exposure to a device that could manipulate biology, with the Time Lords deciding to utilise the Valeyard as a soldier in the Time War as he retains the Doctor's guile and intelligence without his morality, willing to carry out missions that would endanger planets and civilians that the Doctor would reject. Eventually, the Time Lords sent the new Valeyard to investigate a Dalek weapon that is supposedly capable of erasing the Time Lords from history. However, when the Valeyard attempts to turn the weapon on the Daleks, the Time Lords are forced to trap the planet in a time loop where the Valeyard comes to believe that he is the Doctor, fighting the illusionary Daleks created by the weapon's destruction. The Eighth Doctor briefly penetrates the time loop to investigate the Valeyard's existence, but accepts the Valeyard's request to remain on that world so that his other self can continue to believe he is the Doctor fighting the Daleks in a simpler conflict.\n\n==List of appearances==\n\n===Television===\n*''[[The Mysterious Planet]]\n*''[[Mindwarp]]\n*''[[Terror of the Vervoids]]\n*''[[The Ultimate Foe]]\n\n===Novels===\n*''[[Mission: Impractical]]'' (behind the scenes; does not explicitly appear)\n*''[[Millennial Rites]]'' (his dormant potential manifests from the Sixth Doctor, although his words imply that the 'true' Valeyard is involved)\n*''[[Time's Champion]]'' (non-canon novel)\n*''[[Matrix (novel)|Matrix]]'' (faces the Seventh Doctor while acting as [[Jack the Ripper]]; traps wraiths based on corrupted versions of the other twelve Doctors)\n*''[[The Eight Doctors]]'' (briefly appears in the Sixth Doctor's era, but does not meet the Eighth Doctor directly)\n\n===Audio Drama===\n*''[[He Jests at Scars...]]'' (alternate timeline where the Valeyard defeated the Doctor and destroyed the Web of Time)\n*''[[Trial of the Valeyard]]'' (captured by the Time Lords some time after the trial)\n*''[[The Sixth Doctor: The Last Adventure]]'' (appears across the Sixth Doctor's history collecting components for a new plan)\n*''The Eighth Doctor: The Time War 3- The War Valeyard'' (new version of the Valeyard manifesting from the Doctor travelling through a transmat device while holding a machine designed to manipulate the subject's genetic structure)\n\n==See also==\n*[[Twelfth Doctor]]\n*[[Dream Lord]]\n*[[Jo Martin]]s incarnation\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{TardisIndexFile|The Valeyard|Valeyard}}\n\n{{Doctor Who navbox}}\n{{Valeyard stories}}\n{{Doctor Who villains}}\n{{Doctor Who}}\n\n[[Category:Doctor Who audio characters]]\n[[Category:Doctor Who Doctors]]\n[[Category:Television characters introduced in 1986]]\n[[Category:Male characters in television]]\n[[Category:Recurring characters in Doctor Who]]\n", "name_user": "Mondo Beer", "label": "safe", "comment": "rv person theorising that Jo Martin's Doctor was the Valeyard", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valeyard"}
{"title_page": "S-matrix", "text_new": "{{redirect|Scattering matrix|the meaning in linear electrical networks|Scattering parameters}}\n{{For|the 1960s approach to particle physics|S-matrix theory}}\n\nIn [[physics]], the '''S-matrix''' or '''scattering matrix''' relates the initial state and the final state of a physical system undergoing a [[scattering|scattering process]]. It is used in [[quantum mechanics]], [[scattering theory]] and [[quantum field theory]] (QFT).\n\nMore formally, in the context of QFT, the S-matrix is defined as the [[unitary matrix]] connecting sets of asymptotically free particle states (the ''in-states'' and the ''out-states'') in the [[Hilbert space]] of physical states. A multi-particle state is said to be ''free'' (non-interacting) if it [[Representation theory of the Lorentz group|transforms]] under [[Lorentz transformation]]s as a [[tensor product]], or ''direct product'' in physics parlance, of ''one-particle states'' as prescribed by equation {{EquationNote|1|(1)}} below. ''Asymptotically free'' then means that the state has this appearance in either the distant past or the distant future.\n\nWhile the S-matrix may be defined for any background ([[spacetime]]) that is asymptotically solvable and has no [[event horizon]]s, it has a simple form in the case of the [[Minkowski space]]. In this special case, the Hilbert space is a space of irreducible [[unitary representation]]s of the [[inhomogeneous space|inhomogeneous]] [[Lorentz group]] (the [[Poincar\u00e9 group]]); the S-matrix is the [[evolution operator]] between <math>t= - \\infty </math> (the distant past), and <math>t= + \\infty </math>  (the distant future). It is defined only in the limit of zero energy density (or infinite particle separation distance).\n\nIt can be shown that if a quantum field theory in Minkowski space has a [[mass gap]], the [[quantum state|state]] in the asymptotic past and in the asymptotic future are both described by [[Fock space]]s.\n\n==History==\nThe S-matrix was first introduced by [[John Archibald Wheeler]] in the 1937 paper \"On the Mathematical Description of Light Nuclei by the Method of Resonating Group Structure\".<ref>John Archibald Wheeler, \"[http://link.aps.org/abstract/PR/v52/p1107 On the Mathematical Description of Light Nuclei by the Method of Resonating Group Structure]\", ''Phys. Rev.'' 52, 1107\u20131122 (1937).</ref> In this paper Wheeler introduced a ''scattering matrix'' \u2013 a unitary matrix of coefficients connecting \"the asymptotic behaviour of an arbitrary particular solution [of the integral equations] with that of solutions of a standard form\",<ref name = \"Mehra\">[[Jagdish Mehra]], Helmut Rechenberg, ''The Historical Development of Quantum Theory'' (Pages 990 and 1031)  Springer, 2001 {{ISBN|0-387-95086-9}}, {{ISBN|978-0-387-95086-0}}</ref>\nbut did not develop it fully.\n\nIn the 1940s, [[Werner Heisenberg]] developed, independently, and substantiated the idea of the S-matrix. Because of the problematic divergences present in [[quantum field theory]] at that time, Heisenberg was motivated to isolate the ''essential features of the theory'' that would not be affected by future changes as the theory developed. In doing so, he was led to introduce a unitary \"characteristic\" S-matrix.<ref name = \"Mehra\"/>\n\nToday, however, '''exact S-matrix results''' are a crowning achievement of [[conformal field theory]], [[integrable systems]], and several further areas of [[quantum field theory]] and [[string theory]]. S-matrices are not substitutes for a field-theoretic treatment, but rather, complement the end results of such.\n\n==Motivation==\n\nIn high-energy [[particle physics]] we are interested in computing the [[probability]] for different outcomes in [[scattering]] experiments. These experiments can be broken down into three stages:\n\n# Collide together a collection of incoming [[subatomic particle|particle]]s (usually ''two'' particles with high energies).\n# Allowing the incoming particles to interact. These interactions may change the types of particles present (e.g. if an [[electron]] and a [[positron]] [[annihilate]] they may produce two [[photon]]s).\n# Measuring the resulting outgoing particles.\n\nThe process by which the incoming particles are transformed (through their [[interaction]]) into the outgoing particles is called [[scattering]]. For particle physics, a physical theory of these processes must be able to compute the probability for different outgoing particles when different incoming particles  collide with different energies.\n\nThe S-matrix in [[quantum field theory]] achieves exactly this. It is assumed that the small-energy-density approximation is valid in these cases.\n\n==Use==\n\nThe S-matrix is closely related to the transition [[probability amplitude]] in quantum mechanics and to [[cross section (physics)|cross sections]] of various interactions; the [[Matrix element (physics)|elements]] (individual numerical entries) in the S-matrix are known as '''scattering amplitudes'''. [[pole (complex analysis)|Poles]] of the S-matrix in the complex-energy plane are identified with [[bound state]]s, virtual states or [[resonance (particle physics)|resonances]].  [[Branch point|Branch cuts]] of the S-matrix in the complex-energy plane are associated to the opening of a [[scattering channel]].\n\nIn the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] approach to [[quantum field theory]], the S-matrix may be calculated as a [[time-ordered]] [[matrix exponential|exponential]] of the integrated Hamiltonian in the [[interaction picture]]; it may also be expressed using [[Feynman's path integral]]s. In both cases, the [[perturbation theory (quantum mechanics)|perturbative]] calculation of the S-matrix leads to [[Feynman diagram]]s.\n\nIn [[scattering theory]], the '''S-matrix''' is an [[operator (physics)|operator]] mapping free particle ''in-states'' to free particle ''out-states'' ([[scattering channel]]s) in the [[Heisenberg picture]]. This is very useful because often we cannot describe the interaction (at least, not the most interesting ones) exactly.\n\n==In one-dimensional quantum mechanics==\nA simple prototype in which the S-matrix is 2-dimensional is considered first, for the purposes of illustration. In it, particles with sharp energy {{math|''E''}} scatter from a localized potential {{math|''V''}} according to the rules of 1-dimensional quantum mechanics. Already this simple model displays some features of more general cases, but is easier to handle.\n\nEach energy {{math|''E''}} yields an S-matrix {{math|''S'' {{=}} ''S''(''E'')}} that depends on {{math|''V''}}. Thus, the total S-matrix could, figuratively speaking, be visualized, in a suitable basis, as a \"continuous matrix\" with every element zero except for {{math|2 \u00d7 2}}-blocks along the diagonal for a given {{math|''V''}}.\n\n===Definition===\nConsider a localized one dimensional [[potential barrier]] {{math|''V''(''x'')}}, subjected to a beam of quantum particles with energy {{math|''E''}}. These particles are incident on the potential barrier from left to right.\n\nThe solution of [[Schr\u00f6dinger's equation]] outside the potential barrier are [[plane waves]] given by\n:<math>\\psi_L(x)= A e^{ikx} + B e^{-ikx}</math>\nfor the region to the left of the potential barrier, and\n:<math>\\psi_R(x)= C e^{ikx} + D e^{-ikx}</math>\nfor the region to the right to the potential barrier, where\n:<math>k=\\sqrt{2m E/\\hbar^{2}}</math>\nis the [[wave vector]]. The time dependence is not needed in our overview and is hence omitted. The term with coefficient {{math|''A''}} represents the incoming wave, whereas term with coefficient   {{math|''C''}} represents the outgoing wave. {{math|''B''}} stands for the reflecting wave. Since we set the incoming wave moving in the positive direction (coming from the left), {{math|''D''}} is zero and can be omitted.\n\nThe \"scattering amplitude\", i.e., the transition overlap of the outgoing waves with the incoming waves is a linear relation defining the S-matrix,\n:<math>\\begin{pmatrix}B \\\\ C \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} S_{11} & S_{12} \\\\ S_{21} & S_{22} \\end{pmatrix}\\begin{pmatrix} A \\\\ D \\end{pmatrix}.</math>\n\nThe above relation can be written as\n:<math>\\Psi_{out}=S \\Psi_{in}</math>\nwhere\n:<math>\\Psi_{out}=\\begin{pmatrix}B \\\\ C \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad \\Psi_{in}=\\begin{pmatrix}A \\\\ D \\end{pmatrix}, \\qquad S=\\begin{pmatrix} S_{11} & S_{12} \\\\ S_{21} & S_{22} \\end{pmatrix}.</math>\nThe elements of {{math|''S''}} completely characterize the scattering properties of the potential barrier {{math|''V''(''x'')}}.\n\n===Unitary property===\nThe unitary property of S-matrix is directly related to the conservation of the [[probability current]] in [[quantum mechanics]].\n\nThe probability current {{mvar|J}} of the [[wave function]] {{math| ''\u03c8(x)''}}  is defined as\n:<math> J = \\frac{\\hbar}{2mi}\\left(\\psi^* \\frac{\\partial \\psi }{\\partial x}-  \\psi \\frac{\\partial \\psi^* }{\\partial x} \\right) </math>.\nThe current density to the left of the barrier is\n:<math>J_L=\\frac{\\hbar k}{m}\\left(|A|^2-|B|^2\\right)</math>,\nwhile the current density to the right of the barrier is\n:<math>J_R=\\frac{\\hbar k}{m}\\left(|C|^2-|D|^2\\right)</math>.\n\nFor conservation of the probability current density, {{math|''J''<sub>''L''</sub> {{=}} ''J''<sub>''R''</sub>}}. This implies the S-matrix is a [[unitary matrix]].\n:{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n!

In this picture, the operators behave as free field operators and the state vectors have dynamics according to the interaction {{math|''V''}}. Let\n:<math>\\left|\\Psi(t)\\right\\rangle</math>\ndenote a state that has evolved from a free initial state\n:<math>\\left|\\Phi_i\\right\\rangle.</math>\nThe S-matrix element is then defined as the projection of this state on the final state\n:<math>\\left\\langle\\Phi_f\\right|.</math>\nThus\n:<math>S_{fi} \\equiv \\lim_{t \\rightarrow +\\infty} \\left\\langle\\Phi_f|\\Psi(t)\\right\\rangle \\equiv \\left\\langle\\Phi_f\\right|S\\left|\\Phi_i\\right\\rangle,</math>\n\nwhere {{math|''S''}} is the '''S-operator'''.

The approach works in practice and some of the technical issues are addressed in the other sections.\n\n===In and out states===\nHere a slightly more rigorous approach is taken in order to address potential problems that were disregarded in the interaction picture approach of above. The final outcome is, of course, the same as when taking the quicker route. For this, the notions of in and out states are needed. These will be developed in two ways, from vacua, and from free particle states. Needless to say, the two approaches are equivalent, but they illuminate matters from different angles.\n\n====From vacua====\nIf {{math|''a(k)''}}<sup>\u2020</sup> is a [[creation operator]], its [[hermitian adjoint]] is an [[annihilation operator]] and destroys the vacuum,\n:<math>a(k)\\left |*, 0\\right\\rangle = 0.</math>\n\nIn [[Dirac notation]], define\n:<math>|*, 0\\rangle</math>\nas a [[vacuum state|vacuum quantum state]], i.e. a state without real particles. The asterisk signifies that not all vacua are necessarily equal, and certainly not equal to the Hilbert space zero state {{math|0}}. All vacuum states are assumed [[Poincar\u00e9 group|Poincar\u00e9 invariant]], invariance under translations, rotations and boosts,<ref name=Greiner_1/> formally,\n:<math>P^\\mu |*, 0\\rangle = |*, 0\\rangle, \\quad M^{\\mu\\nu} |*, 0\\rangle = |*, 0\\rangle,</math>\nwhere {{math|''P''<sup>''\u03bc''</sup>}} is the '''generator of translation''' in space and time, and {{math|''M''<sup>''\u03bc\u03bd''</sup>}} is the generator of [[Lorentz transformation]]s. Thus the description of the vacuum is independent of the frame of reference. Associated to the in and out states to be defined are the in and out '''field operators''' (aka '''fields''') {{math|''\u03a6''<sub>''i''</sub>}} and {{math|''\u03a6''<sub>''o''</sub>}}. Attention is here focused to the simplest case, that of a '''scalar theory''' in order to exemplify with the least possible cluttering of the notation. The in and out fields satisfy\n:<math>(\\Box^2 + m^2)\\phi_{i,o}(x) = 0,</math>\nthe free [[Klein\u2013Gordon equation]]. These fields are postulated to have the same equal time commutation relations ('''ETCR''') as the free fields,\n:<math>\\begin{align}{[\\phi_{i,o}(x), \\pi_{i,o}(y)]}_{x_0 = y_0} &= i\\delta(\\mathbf{x} - \\mathbf{y}),\\\\\n{[\\phi_{i,o}(x), \\phi_{i,o}(y)]}_{x_0 = y_0} &= {[\\pi_{i,o}(x), \\pi_{i,o}(y)]}_{x_0 = y_0} = 0\\end{align},</math>\nwhere {{math|''\u03c0''<sub>''i'',''j''</sub>}} is the field '''canonically conjugate''' to {{math|''\u03a6''<sub>''i'',''j''</sub>}}. Associated to the in and out fields are two sets of  creation and annihilation operators, {{math|''a<sub>i</sub>''(''k'')}}<sup>\u2020</sup> and {{math|''a<sub>f</sub> ''(''k'')}}<sup>\u2020</sup>, acting in the ''same'' [[Hilbert space]],<ref>{{harvnb|Weinberg|2002}} Chapter 3. See especially remark at the beginning of section 3.2.</ref> on two ''distinct'' complete sets ([[Fock space]]s; initial space {{mvar|i}}, final space {{mvar|f}} ). These operators satisfy the usual commutation rules,\n:<math>\\begin{align}{[a_{i,o}(\\mathbf{p}), a^\\dagger_{i,o}(\\mathbf{p}')]} &= i\\delta(\\mathbf{p} - \\mathbf{p'}),\\\\\n{[a_{i,o}(\\mathbf{p}), a_{i,o}(\\mathbf{p'})]} &= {[a^\\dagger_{i,o}(\\mathbf{p}), a^\\dagger_{i,o}(\\mathbf{p'})]} = 0.\\end{align}</math>\n\nThe action of the creation operators on their respective vacua and states with a finite number of particles in the in and out states is given by\n:<math>\\begin{align}\\left| i, k_1\\ldots k_n \\right\\rangle &= a_i^\\dagger (k_1)\\cdots a_i^\\dagger (k_n)\\left| i, 0\\right\\rangle,\\\\\n                    \\left| f, p_1\\ldots p_n \\right\\rangle &= a_f^\\dagger (p_1)\\cdots a_f^\\dagger (p_n)\\left| f, 0\\right\\rangle,\\end{align}</math>\nwhere issues of normalization have been ignored. See the next section for a detailed account on how a general {{nowrap|{{mvar|n}}-particle}} state is normalized. The initial and final spaces are defined by\n:<math>\\mathcal H_i = \\operatorname{span}\\{ \\left| i, k_1\\ldots k_n \\right\\rangle = a_i^\\dagger (k_1)\\cdots a_i^\\dagger (k_n)\\left| i, 0\\right\\rangle\\},</math>\n:<math>\\mathcal H_f = \\operatorname{span}\\{ \\left| f, p_1\\ldots p_n \\right\\rangle = a_f^\\dagger (p_1)\\cdots a_f^\\dagger (p_n)\\left| f, 0\\right\\rangle\\}.</math>\n\nThe asymptotic states are assumed to have well defined Poincar\u00e9 transformation properties, i.e. they are assumed to transform as a direct product of one-particle states.<ref name=Weinberg_1>{{harvnb|Weinberg|2002}} Chapter 3.</ref> This is a characteristic of a non-interacting field. From this follows that the asymptotic states are all [[eigenstate]]s of the momentum operator {{math|''P<sup>\u03bc</sup>''}},<ref name=Greiner_1/>\n:<math>P^\\mu\\left| i, k_1\\ldots k_m \\right\\rangle = k_1^\\mu + \\cdots + k_m^\\mu\\left| i, k_1\\ldots k_m \\right\\rangle, \\quad P^\\mu\\left| f, p_1\\ldots p_n \\right\\rangle = p_1^\\mu + \\cdots + p_n^\\mu\\left| f, p_1\\ldots p_n \\right\\rangle.</math>\nIn particular, they are eigenstates of the full Hamiltonian,\n:<math>H = P^0.</math>\n\nThe vacuum is usually postulated to be stable and unique,<ref name=Greiner_1/><ref group=nb>This is not true if an open system is studied. Under an influence of an external field the in and out vacua can differ since the external field can produce particles.</ref>\n:<math>|i, 0\\rangle = |f, 0\\rangle = |*,0\\rangle \\equiv |0\\rangle.</math>.\n\nThe interaction is assumed adiabatically turned on and off.\n\n====Heisenberg picture====\nThe [[Heisenberg picture]] is employed henceforth. In this picture, the states are time-independent. A Heisenberg state vector thus represents the complete spacetime history of a system of particles.<ref name=Weinberg_1/> The labeling of the in and out states refers to the asymptotic appearance. A state {{math|\u03a8<sub>''\u03b1'', ''in''</sub>}} is characterized by that as {{math|''t''\u2192\u2212\u221e}} the particle content is that represented collectively by {{mvar|\u03b1}}. Likewise, a state {{math|\u03a8<sub>''\u03b2'', ''out''</sub>}} will have the particle content represented by {{mvar|\u03b2}} for {{math|''t''\u2192+\u221e}}. Using the assumption that the in and out states, as well as the interacting states, inhabit the same Hilbert space and assuming completeness of the normalized in and out states (postulate of asymptotic completeness<ref name=Greiner_1/>), the initial states can be expanded in a basis of final states (or vice versa). The explicit expression is given later after more notation and terminology has been introduced. The expansion coefficients are precisely the S-matrix elements to be defined below.\n\nWhile the state vectors are constant in time in the Heisenberg picture, the physical states they represent are ''not''. If a system is found to be in a state {{mvar|\u03a8}} at time {{math|''t'' {{=}} 0}}, then it will be found in the state {{math|''U''(''\u03c4'')\u03a8 {{=}}''e''<sup>\u2212''iH\u03c4''</sup>\u03a8}} at time {{math|''t'' {{=}} ''\u03c4''}}. This is not (necessarily) the same Heisenberg state vector, but it is an ''equivalent'' state vector, meaning that it will, upon measurement, be found to be one of the final states from the expansion with nonzero coefficient. Letting {{mvar|\u03c4}} vary one sees that the observed {{mvar|\u03a8}} (not measured) is indeed the [[Schr\u00f6dinger picture]] state vector. By repeating the measurement sufficiently many times and averaging, one may say that the ''same'' state vector is indeed found at time {{math|''t'' {{=}} \u03c4}} as at time {{math|''t'' {{=}} 0}}. This reflects the expansion above of an in state into out states.\n\n====From free particle states====\nFor this viewpoint, one should consider how the archetypical scattering experiment is performed. The initial particles are prepared in well defined states where they are so far apart that they don't interact. They are somehow made to interact, and the final particles are registered when they are so far apart that they have ceased to interact. The idea is to look for states in the [[Heisenberg picture]] that in the distant past had the appearance of free particle states. This will be the in states. Likewise, an out state will be a state that in the distant future has the appearance of a free particle state.<ref name=Weinberg_1/>\n\nThe notation from the general reference for this section, {{harvtxt|Weinberg|2002}} will be used. A general non-interacting multi-particle state is given by\n:<math>\\Psi_{p_1\\sigma_1 n_1;p_2\\sigma_2 n_2;\\cdots},</math>\nwhere\n*{{mvar|p}} is momentum,\n*{{mvar|\u03c3}} is spin z-component or, in the massless case, [[helicity (particle physics)|helicity]],\n*{{mvar|n}} is particle species.\nThese states are normalized as\n:<math>\\left(\\Psi_{p_1'\\sigma_1' n_1';p_2'\\sigma_2' n_2';\\cdots}, \\Psi_{p_1\\sigma_1 n_1;p_2\\sigma_2 n_2;\\cdots}\\right)\n=\\delta^3(\\mathbf{p}_1' - \\mathbf{p}_1)\\delta_{\\sigma_1'\\sigma_1}\\delta_{n_1'n_1}\n\\delta^3(\\mathbf{p}_2' - \\mathbf{p}_2)\\delta_{\\sigma_2'\\sigma_2}\\delta_{n_2'n_2}\\cdots \\quad \\pm \\text{ permutations}.</math>\nPermutations work as such; if {{math|''s'' \u2208 ''S''<sub>''k''</sub>}} is a permutation of {{math|''k''}} objects (for a {{nowrap|{{mvar|k}}-particle}} state) such that\n:<math>n_{s(i)}' = n_{i}, \\quad 1 \\le i \\le k,</math>\nthen a nonzero term results. The sign is plus unless {{mvar|s}} involves an odd number of fermion transpositions, in which case it is minus. The notation is usually abbreviated letting one Greek letter stand for the whole collection describing the state. In abbreviated form the normalization becomes\n:<math>\\left(\\Psi_{\\alpha'}, \\Psi_\\alpha\\right) = \\delta(\\alpha' - \\alpha).</math>\nWhen integrating over free-particle states one writes in this notation\n:<math>\\int d\\alpha\\cdots \\equiv \\sum_{n_1\\sigma_1n_2\\sigma_2\\cdots} \\int d^3p_1d^3p_2\\cdots,</math>\nwhere the sum includes only terms such that no two terms are equal modulo a permutation of the particle type indices. The sets of states sought for are supposed to be ''complete''. This is expressed as\n:<math>\\Psi = \\int d\\alpha \\Psi_\\alpha\\left(\\Psi_\\alpha, \\Psi\\right),</math>\nwhich could be paraphrased as\n:<math>\\int d\\alpha \\left|\\Psi_\\alpha\\right\\rangle\\left\\langle\\Psi_\\alpha\\right| = 1,</math>\nwhere for each fixed {{mvar|\u03b1}}, the right hand side is a projection operator onto the state {{mvar|\u03b1}}. Under an inhomogeneous Lorentz transformation {{math|(\u039b, ''a'')}}, the field transforms according to the rule\n\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>U(\\Lambda ,a)\\Psi_{p_1\\sigma_1 n_1;p_2\\sigma_2 n_2\\cdots} = e^{-ia_\\mu((\\Lambda p_1)^\\mu + (\\Lambda p_2)^\\mu + \\cdots)}\n\\sqrt{\\frac{(\\Lambda p_1)^0(\\Lambda p_2)^0\\cdots}{p_1^0p_2^0\\cdots}}\\sum_{\\sigma_1'\\sigma_2'\\cdots}\nD_{\\sigma_1'\\sigma_1}^{(j_1)}(W(\\Lambda, p_1))D_{\\sigma_2'\\sigma_2}^{(j_2)}(W(\\Lambda, p_2))\\cdots\n\\Psi_{\\Lambda p_1\\sigma_1' n_1;\\Lambda p_2\\sigma_2' n_2\\cdots},</math>|{{EquationRef|1}}}}\n\nwhere {{math|''W''(\u039b, ''p'')}} is the [[Wigner rotation]] and {{math|''D''<sup>(''j'')</sup>}} is the {{nowrap|{{math|(2''j'' + 1)}}-dimensional}} representation of {{math|SO(3)}}. By putting {{math|\u039b {{=}} 1, ''a'' {{=}} (''\u03c4'', 0, 0, 0)}}, for which {{mvar|''U''}} is {{math|exp(''iH\u03c4'')}}, in {{EquationNote|1|(1)}}, it immediately follows that\n:<math>H\\Psi = E_\\alpha\\Psi, \\quad E_\\alpha = p_1^0 + p_2^0 + \\cdots ,</math>\nso the in  and out states sough after are eigenstates of the full Hamiltonian that are necessarily non-interacting due to the absence of mixed particle energy terms. The discussion in the section above suggests that the in states {{math|\u03a8<sup>+</sup>}} and the out states {{math|\u03a8<sup>\u2212</sup>}} should be such that\n:<math>e^{-iH\\tau}\\int d\\alpha g(\\alpha)\\Psi_\\alpha^\\pm = \\int d\\alpha e^{-iE_\\alpha \\tau}g(\\alpha)\\Psi_\\alpha^\\pm</math>\nfor large positive and negative {{mvar|\u03c4}} has the appearance of the corresponding package, represented by {{math|''g''}}, of free-particle states, {{math|''g''}} assumed smooth and suitably localized in momentum. Wave packages are necessary, else the time evolution will yield only a phase factor indicating free particles, which cannot be the case. The right hand side follows from that the in and out states are eigenstates of the Hamiltonian per above. To formalize this requirement, assume that the full [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] {{mvar|H}} can be divided into two terms, a free-particle Hamiltonian {{math|''H''<sub>0</sub>}} and an interaction {{mvar|V}}, {{math|''H'' {{=}} ''H''<sub>0</sub> + ''V''}} such that the eigenstates {{math|\u03a6<sub>''\u03b3''</sub>}} of {{math|''H''<sub>0</sub>}} have the same appearance as the in- and out-states with respect to normalization and Lorentz transformation properties,\n:<math>H_0\\Phi_\\alpha = E_\\alpha\\Phi_\\alpha,</math>\n:<math>(\\Phi_\\alpha', \\Phi_\\alpha) = \\delta(\\alpha' - \\alpha).</math>\n\nThe in and out states are defined as eigenstates of the full Hamiltonian,\n:<math>H\\Psi_\\alpha^\\pm = E_\\alpha\\Psi_\\alpha^\\pm,</math>\nsatisfying\n:<math>e^{-iH\\tau} \\int d\\alpha g(\\alpha) \\Psi_\\alpha^\\pm \\rightarrow e^{-iH_0\\tau}\\int d\\alpha g(\\alpha) \\Phi_\\alpha.</math>\nfor {{math|''\u03c4'' \u2192 \u2212\u221e}} or {{math|''\u03c4'' \u2192 +\u221e}} respectively. Define\n:<math>\\Omega(\\tau) \\equiv e^{+iH\\tau}e^{-iH_0\\tau},</math>\nthen\n:<math>\\Psi_\\alpha^\\pm = \\Omega(\\mp \\infty)\\Phi_\\alpha.</math>\nThis last expression will work only using wave packages.From these definitions follow that the in and out states are normalized in the same way as the free-particle states,\n:<math>(\\Psi_\\beta^+, \\Psi_\\alpha^+) = (\\Phi_\\beta, \\Phi_\\alpha) = (\\Psi_\\beta^-, \\Psi_\\alpha^-) = \\delta(\\beta - \\alpha),</math>\nand the three sets are unitarily equivalent. Now rewrite the eigenvalue equation,\n:<math>(E_\\alpha - H_0 \\pm i\\epsilon)\\Psi_\\alpha^\\pm = \\pm i\\epsilon\\Psi_\\alpha^\\pm + V\\Psi_\\alpha^\\pm,</math>\nwhere the {{math|''\u00b1i\u03b5''}} terms has been added to make the operator on the LHS invertible. Since the in and out states reduce to the free-particle states for {{math|''V'' \u2192 0}}, put\n:<math>i\\epsilon\\Psi_\\alpha^\\pm = i\\epsilon\\Phi_\\alpha</math>\non the RHS to obtain\n:<math>\\Psi_\\alpha^\\pm = \\Phi_\\alpha + (E_\\alpha - H_0 \\pm i\\epsilon)^{-1}V\\Psi_\\alpha^\\pm.</math>\nThen use the completeness of the free-particle states,\n:<math>V\\Psi_\\alpha^\\pm = \\int d\\beta (\\Phi_\\beta, V\\Psi_\\alpha^\\pm)\\Phi_\\beta \\equiv \\int d\\beta T_{\\beta\\alpha}^\\pm\\Phi_\\beta,</math>\nto finally obtain\n:<math>\\Psi_\\alpha^\\pm = \\Phi_\\alpha + \\int d\\beta \\frac{T_{\\beta\\alpha}^\\pm\\Phi_\\beta}{E_\\alpha - E_\\beta \\pm i\\epsilon}.</math>\nHere {{math|''H''<sub>0</sub>}} has been replaced by its eigenvalue on the free-particle states.

It is used in [[quantum mechanics]], [[scattering theory]] and [[quantum field theory]] (QFT).\n\nMore formally, in the context of QFT, the S-matrix is defined as the [[unitary matrix]] connecting sets of asymptotically free particle states (the ''in-states'' and the ''out-states'') in the [[Hilbert space]] of physical states. A multi-particle state is said to be ''free'' (non-interacting) if it [[Representation theory of the Lorentz group|transforms]] under [[Lorentz transformation]]s as a [[tensor product]], or ''direct product'' in physics parlance, of ''one-particle states'' as prescribed by equation {{EquationNote|1|(1)}} below. ''Asymptotically free'' then means that the state has this appearance in either the distant past or the distant future.\n\nWhile the S-matrix may be defined for any background ([[spacetime]]) that is asymptotically solvable and has no [[event horizon]]s, it has a simple form in the case of the [[Minkowski space]]. In this special case, the Hilbert space is a space of irreducible [[unitary representation]]s of the [[inhomogeneous space|inhomogeneous]] [[Lorentz group]] (the [[Poincar\u00e9 group]]); the S-matrix is the [[evolution operator]] between time equal to minus infinity (the distant past), and time equal to plus infinity (the distant future). It is defined only in the limit of zero energy density (or infinite particle separation distance).\n\nIt can be shown that if a quantum field theory in Minkowski space has a [[mass gap]], the [[quantum state|state]] in the asymptotic past and in the asymptotic future are both described by [[Fock space]]s.\n\n==History==\nThe S-matrix was first introduced by [[John Archibald Wheeler]] in the 1937 paper \"On the Mathematical Description of Light Nuclei by the Method of Resonating Group Structure\".<ref>John Archibald Wheeler, \"[http://link.aps.org/abstract/PR/v52/p1107 On the Mathematical Description of Light Nuclei by the Method of Resonating Group Structure]\", ''Phys. Rev.'' 52, 1107\u20131122 (1937).</ref> In this paper Wheeler introduced a ''scattering matrix'' \u2013 a unitary matrix of coefficients connecting \"the asymptotic behaviour of an arbitrary particular solution [of the integral equations] with that of solutions of a standard form\",<ref name = \"Mehra\">[[Jagdish Mehra]], Helmut Rechenberg, ''The Historical Development of Quantum Theory'' (Pages 990 and 1031)  Springer, 2001 {{ISBN|0-387-95086-9}}, {{ISBN|978-0-387-95086-0}}</ref>\nbut did not develop it fully.\n\nIn the 1940s, [[Werner Heisenberg]] developed, independently, and substantiated the idea of the S-matrix. Because of the problematic divergences present in [[quantum field theory]] at that time, Heisenberg was motivated to isolate the ''essential features of the theory'' that would not be affected by future changes as the theory developed. In doing so, he was led to introduce a unitary \"characteristic\" S-matrix.<ref name = \"Mehra\"/>\n\nToday, however, '''exact S-matrix results''' are a crowning achievement of [[conformal field theory]], [[integrable systems]], and several further areas of [[quantum field theory]] and [[string theory]]. S-matrices are not substitutes for a field-theoretic treatment, but rather, complement the end results of such.\n\n==Motivation==\n\nIn high-energy [[particle physics]] we are interested in computing the [[probability]] for different outcomes in [[scattering]] experiments. These experiments can be broken down into three stages:\n\n# Collide together a collection of incoming [[subatomic particle|particle]]s (usually ''two'' particles with high energies).\n# Allowing the incoming particles to interact. These interactions may change the types of particles present (e.g. if an [[electron]] and a [[positron]] [[annihilate]] they may produce two [[photon]]s).\n# Measuring the resulting outgoing particles.\n\nThe process by which the incoming particles are transformed (through their [[interaction]]) into the outgoing particles is called [[scattering]]. For particle physics, a physical theory of these processes must be able to compute the probability for different outgoing particles when different incoming particles  collide with different energies.\n\nThe S-matrix in [[quantum field theory]] achieves exactly this. It is assumed that the small-energy-density approximation is valid in these cases.\n\n==Use==\n\nThe S-matrix is closely related to the transition [[probability amplitude]] in quantum mechanics and to [[cross section (physics)|cross sections]] of various interactions; the [[Matrix element (physics)|elements]] (individual numerical entries) in the S-matrix are known as '''scattering amplitudes'''. [[pole (complex analysis)|Poles]] of the S-matrix in the complex-energy plane are identified with [[bound state]]s, virtual states or [[resonance (particle physics)|resonances]].  [[Branch point|Branch cuts]] of the S-matrix in the complex-energy plane are associated to the opening of a [[scattering channel]].\n\nIn the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] approach to [[quantum field theory]], the S-matrix may be calculated as a [[time-ordered]] [[matrix exponential|exponential]] of the integrated Hamiltonian in the [[interaction picture]]; it may also be expressed using [[Feynman's path integral]]s. In both cases, the [[perturbation theory (quantum mechanics)|perturbative]] calculation of the S-matrix leads to [[Feynman diagram]]s.\n\nIn [[scattering theory]], the '''S-matrix''' is an [[operator (physics)|operator]] mapping free particle ''in-states'' to free particle ''out-states'' ([[scattering channel]]s) in the [[Heisenberg picture]]. This is very useful because often we cannot describe the interaction (at least, not the most interesting ones) exactly.\n\n==In one-dimensional quantum mechanics==\nA simple prototype in which the S-matrix is 2-dimensional is considered first, for the purposes of illustration. In it, particles with sharp energy {{math|''E''}} scatter from a localized potential {{math|''V''}} according to the rules of 1-dimensional quantum mechanics. Already this simple model displays some features of more general cases, but is easier to handle.\n\nEach energy {{math|''E''}} yields an S-matrix {{math|''S'' {{=}} ''S''(''E'')}} that depends on {{math|''V''}}. Thus, the total S-matrix could, figuratively speaking, be visualized, in a suitable basis, as a \"continuous matrix\" with every element zero except for {{math|2 \u00d7 2}}-blocks along the diagonal for a given {{math|''V''}}.\n\n===Definition===\nConsider a localized one dimensional [[potential barrier]] {{math|''V''(''x'')}}, subjected to a beam of quantum particles with energy {{math|''E''}}. These particles are incident on the potential barrier from left to right.\n\nThe solution of [[Schr\u00f6dinger's equation]] outside the potential barrier are [[plane waves]] given by\n:<math>\\psi_L(x)= A e^{ikx} + B e^{-ikx}</math>\nfor the region to the left of the potential barrier, and\n:<math>\\psi_R(x)= C e^{ikx} + D e^{-ikx}</math>\nfor the region to the right to the potential barrier, where\n:<math>k=\\sqrt{2m E/\\hbar^{2}}</math>\nis the [[wave vector]]. The time dependence is not needed in our overview and is hence omitted. The term with coefficient {{math|''A''}} represents the incoming wave, whereas term with coefficient   {{math|''C''}} represents the outgoing wave. {{math|''B''}} stands for the reflecting wave. Since we set the incoming wave moving in the positive direction (coming from the left), {{math|''D''}} is zero and can be omitted.\n\nThe \"scattering amplitude\", i.e., the transition overlap of the outgoing waves with the incoming waves is a linear relation defining the S-matrix,\n:<math>\\begin{pmatrix}B \\\\ C \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} S_{11} & S_{12} \\\\ S_{21} & S_{22} \\end{pmatrix}\\begin{pmatrix} A \\\\ D \\end{pmatrix}.</math>\n\nThe above relation can be written as\n:<math>\\Psi_{out}=S \\Psi_{in}</math>\nwhere\n:<math>\\Psi_{out}=\\begin{pmatrix}B \\\\ C \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad \\Psi_{in}=\\begin{pmatrix}A \\\\ D \\end{pmatrix}, \\qquad S=\\begin{pmatrix} S_{11} & S_{12} \\\\ S_{21} & S_{22} \\end{pmatrix}.</math>\nThe elements of {{math|''S''}} completely characterize the scattering properties of the potential barrier {{math|''V''(''x'')}}.\n\n===Unitary property===\nThe unitary property of S-matrix is directly related to the conservation of the [[probability current]] in [[quantum mechanics]].\n\nThe probability current {{mvar|J}} of the [[wave function]] {{math| ''\u03c8(x)''}}  is defined as\n:<math> J = \\frac{\\hbar}{2mi}\\left(\\psi^* \\frac{\\partial \\psi }{\\partial x}-  \\psi \\frac{\\partial \\psi^* }{\\partial x} \\right) </math>.\nThe current density to the left of the barrier is\n:<math>J_L=\\frac{\\hbar k}{m}\\left(|A|^2-|B|^2\\right)</math>,\nwhile the current density to the right of the barrier is\n:<math>J_R=\\frac{\\hbar k}{m}\\left(|C|^2-|D|^2\\right)</math>.\n\nFor conservation of the probability current density, {{math|''J''<sub>''L''</sub> {{=}} ''J''<sub>''R''</sub>}}. This implies the S-matrix is a [[unitary matrix]].\n:{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n!

The approach works in practice and some of the technical issues are addressed in the other sections.\n\n===In and out states===\nHere a slightly more rigorous approach is taken in order to address potential problems that were disregarded in the interaction picture approach of above. The final outcome is, of course, the same as when taking the quicker route. For this, the notions of in and out states are needed. These will be developed in two ways, from vacua, and from free particle states. Needless to say, the two approaches are equivalent, but they illuminate matters from different angles.\n\n====From vacua====\nIf {{math|''a(k)''}}<sup>\u2020</sup> is a [[creation operator]], its [[hermitian adjoint]] is an [[annihilation operator]] and destroys the vacuum,\n:<math>a(k)\\left |*, 0\\right\\rangle = 0.</math>\n\nIn [[Dirac notation]], define\n:<math>|*, 0\\rangle</math>\nas a [[vacuum state|vacuum quantum state]], i.e. a state without real particles. The asterisk signifies that not all vacua are necessarily equal, and certainly not equal to the Hilbert space zero state {{math|0}}. All vacuum states are assumed [[Poincar\u00e9 group|Poincar\u00e9 invariant]], invariance under translations, rotations and boosts,<ref name=Greiner_1/> formally,\n:<math>P^\\mu |*, 0\\rangle = |*, 0\\rangle, \\quad M^{\\mu\\nu} |*, 0\\rangle = |*, 0\\rangle,</math>\nwhere {{math|''P''<sup>''\u03bc''</sup>}} is the '''generator of translation''' in space and time, and {{math|''M''<sup>''\u03bc\u03bd''</sup>}} is the generator of [[Lorentz transformation]]s. Thus the description of the vacuum is independent of the frame of reference. Associated to the in and out states to be defined are the in and out '''field operators''' (aka '''fields''') {{math|''\u03a6''<sub>''i''</sub>}} and {{math|''\u03a6''<sub>''o''</sub>}}. Attention is here focused to the simplest case, that of a '''scalar theory''' in order to exemplify with the least possible cluttering of the notation. The in and out fields satisfy\n:<math>(\\Box^2 + m^2)\\phi_{i,o}(x) = 0,</math>\nthe free [[Klein\u2013Gordon equation]]. These fields are postulated to have the same equal time commutation relations ('''ETCR''') as the free fields,\n:<math>\\begin{align}{[\\phi_{i,o}(x), \\pi_{i,o}(y)]}_{x_0 = y_0} &= i\\delta(\\mathbf{x} - \\mathbf{y}),\\\\\n{[\\phi_{i,o}(x), \\phi_{i,o}(y)]}_{x_0 = y_0} &= {[\\pi_{i,o}(x), \\pi_{i,o}(y)]}_{x_0 = y_0} = 0\\end{align},</math>\nwhere {{math|''\u03c0''<sub>''i'',''j''</sub>}} is the field '''canonically conjugate''' to {{math|''\u03a6''<sub>''i'',''j''</sub>}}. Associated to the in and out fields are two sets of  creation and annihilation operators, {{math|''a<sub>i</sub>''(''k'')}}<sup>\u2020</sup> and {{math|''a<sub>f</sub> ''(''k'')}}<sup>\u2020</sup>, acting in the ''same'' [[Hilbert space]],<ref>{{harvnb|Weinberg|2002}} Chapter 3. See especially remark at the beginning of section 3.2.</ref> on two ''distinct'' complete sets ([[Fock space]]s; initial space {{mvar|i}}, final space {{mvar|f}} ). These operators satisfy the usual commutation rules,\n:<math>\\begin{align}{[a_{i,o}(\\mathbf{p}), a^\\dagger_{i,o}(\\mathbf{p}')]} &= i\\delta(\\mathbf{p} - \\mathbf{p'}),\\\\\n{[a_{i,o}(\\mathbf{p}), a_{i,o}(\\mathbf{p'})]} &= {[a^\\dagger_{i,o}(\\mathbf{p}), a^\\dagger_{i,o}(\\mathbf{p'})]} = 0.\\end{align}</math>\n\nThe action of the creation operators on their respective vacua and states with a finite number of particles in the in and out states is given by\n:<math>\\begin{align}\\left| i, k_1\\ldots k_n \\right\\rangle &= a_i^\\dagger (k_1)\\cdots a_i^\\dagger (k_n)\\left| i, 0\\right\\rangle,\\\\\n                    \\left| f, p_1\\ldots p_n \\right\\rangle &= a_f^\\dagger (p_1)\\cdots a_f^\\dagger (p_n)\\left| f, 0\\right\\rangle,\\end{align}</math>\nwhere issues of normalization have been ignored. See the next section for a detailed account on how a general {{nowrap|{{mvar|n}}-particle}} state is normalized. The initial and final spaces are defined by\n:<math>\\mathcal H_i = \\operatorname{span}\\{ \\left| i, k_1\\ldots k_n \\right\\rangle = a_i^\\dagger (k_1)\\cdots a_i^\\dagger (k_n)\\left| i, 0\\right\\rangle\\},</math>\n:<math>\\mathcal H_f = \\operatorname{span}\\{ \\left| f, p_1\\ldots p_n \\right\\rangle = a_f^\\dagger (p_1)\\cdots a_f^\\dagger (p_n)\\left| f, 0\\right\\rangle\\}.</math>\n\nThe asymptotic states are assumed to have well defined Poincar\u00e9 transformation properties, i.e. they are assumed to transform as a direct product of one-particle states.<ref name=Weinberg_1>{{harvnb|Weinberg|2002}} Chapter 3.</ref> This is a characteristic of a non-interacting field. From this follows that the asymptotic states are all [[eigenstate]]s of the momentum operator {{math|''P<sup>\u03bc</sup>''}},<ref name=Greiner_1/>\n:<math>P^\\mu\\left| i, k_1\\ldots k_m \\right\\rangle = k_1^\\mu + \\cdots + k_m^\\mu\\left| i, k_1\\ldots k_m \\right\\rangle, \\quad P^\\mu\\left| f, p_1\\ldots p_n \\right\\rangle = p_1^\\mu + \\cdots + p_n^\\mu\\left| f, p_1\\ldots p_n \\right\\rangle.</math>\nIn particular, they are eigenstates of the full Hamiltonian,\n:<math>H = P^0.</math>\n\nThe vacuum is usually postulated to be stable and unique,<ref name=Greiner_1/><ref group=nb>This is not true if an open system is studied. Under an influence of an external field the in and out vacua can differ since the external field can produce particles.</ref>\n:<math>|i, 0\\rangle = |f, 0\\rangle = |*,0\\rangle \\equiv |0\\rangle.</math>.\n\nThe interaction is assumed adiabatically turned on and off.\n\n====Heisenberg picture====\nThe [[Heisenberg picture]] is employed henceforth. In this picture, the states are time-independent. A Heisenberg state vector thus represents the complete spacetime history of a system of particles.<ref name=Weinberg_1/> The labeling of the in and out states refers to the asymptotic appearance. A state {{math|\u03a8<sub>''\u03b1'', ''in''</sub>}} is characterized by that as {{math|''t''\u2192\u2212\u221e}} the particle content is that represented collectively by {{mvar|\u03b1}}. Likewise, a state {{math|\u03a8<sub>''\u03b2'', ''out''</sub>}} will have the particle content represented by {{mvar|\u03b2}} for {{math|''t''\u2192+\u221e}}. Using the assumption that the in and out states, as well as the interacting states, inhabit the same Hilbert space and assuming completeness of the normalized in and out states (postulate of asymptotic completeness<ref name=Greiner_1/>), the initial states can be expanded in a basis of final states (or vice versa). The explicit expression is given later after more notation and terminology has been introduced. The expansion coefficients are precisely the S-matrix elements to be defined below.\n\nWhile the state vectors are constant in time in the Heisenberg picture, the physical states they represent are ''not''. If a system is found to be in a state {{mvar|\u03a8}} at time {{math|''t'' {{=}} 0}}, then it will be found in the state {{math|''U''(''\u03c4'')\u03a8 {{=}}''e''<sup>\u2212''iH\u03c4''</sup>\u03a8}} at time {{math|''t'' {{=}} ''\u03c4''}}. This is not (necessarily) the same Heisenberg state vector, but it is an ''equivalent'' state vector, meaning that it will, upon measurement, be found to be one of the final states from the expansion with nonzero coefficient. Letting {{mvar|\u03c4}} vary one sees that the observed {{mvar|\u03a8}} (not measured) is indeed the [[Schr\u00f6dinger picture]] state vector. By repeating the measurement sufficiently many times and averaging, one may say that the ''same'' state vector is indeed found at time {{math|''t'' {{=}} \u03c4}} as at time {{math|''t'' {{=}} 0}}. This reflects the expansion above of an in state into out states.\n\n====From free particle states====\nFor this viewpoint, one should consider how the archetypical scattering experiment is performed. The initial particles are prepared in well defined states where they are so far apart that they don't interact. They are somehow made to interact, and the final particles are registered when they are so far apart that they have ceased to interact. The idea is to look for states in the [[Heisenberg picture]] that in the distant past had the appearance of free particle states. This will be the in states. Likewise, an out state will be a state that in the distant future has the appearance of a free particle state.<ref name=Weinberg_1/>\n\nThe notation from the general reference for this section, {{harvtxt|Weinberg|2002}} will be used. A general non-interacting multi-particle state is given by\n:<math>\\Psi_{p_1\\sigma_1 n_1;p_2\\sigma_2 n_2;\\cdots},</math>\nwhere\n*{{mvar|p}} is momentum,\n*{{mvar|\u03c3}} is spin z-component or, in the massless case, [[helicity (particle physics)|helicity]],\n*{{mvar|n}} is particle species.\nThese states are normalized as\n:<math>\\left(\\Psi_{p_1'\\sigma_1' n_1';p_2'\\sigma_2' n_2';\\cdots}, \\Psi_{p_1\\sigma_1 n_1;p_2\\sigma_2 n_2;\\cdots}\\right)\n=\\delta^3(\\mathbf{p}_1' - \\mathbf{p}_1)\\delta_{\\sigma_1'\\sigma_1}\\delta_{n_1'n_1}\n\\delta^3(\\mathbf{p}_2' - \\mathbf{p}_2)\\delta_{\\sigma_2'\\sigma_2}\\delta_{n_2'n_2}\\cdots \\quad \\pm \\text{ permutations}.</math>\nPermutations work as such; if {{math|''s'' \u2208 ''S''<sub>''k''</sub>}} is a permutation of {{math|''k''}} objects (for a {{nowrap|{{mvar|k}}-particle}} state) such that\n:<math>n_{s(i)}' = n_{i}, \\quad 1 \\le i \\le k,</math>\nthen a nonzero term results. The sign is plus unless {{mvar|s}} involves an odd number of fermion transpositions, in which case it is minus. The notation is usually abbreviated letting one Greek letter stand for the whole collection describing the state. In abbreviated form the normalization becomes\n:<math>\\left(\\Psi_{\\alpha'}, \\Psi_\\alpha\\right) = \\delta(\\alpha' - \\alpha).</math>\nWhen integrating over free-particle states one writes in this notation\n:<math>\\int d\\alpha\\cdots \\equiv \\sum_{n_1\\sigma_1n_2\\sigma_2\\cdots} \\int d^3p_1d^3p_2\\cdots,</math>\nwhere the sum includes only terms such that no two terms are equal modulo a permutation of the particle type indices. The sets of states sought for are supposed to be ''complete''. This is expressed as\n:<math>\\Psi = \\int d\\alpha \\Psi_\\alpha\\left(\\Psi_\\alpha, \\Psi\\right),</math>\nwhich could be paraphrased as\n:<math>\\int d\\alpha \\left|\\Psi_\\alpha\\right\\rangle\\left\\langle\\Psi_\\alpha\\right| = 1,</math>\nwhere for each fixed {{mvar|\u03b1}}, the right hand side is a projection operator onto the state {{mvar|\u03b1}}. Under an inhomogeneous Lorentz transformation {{math|(\u039b, ''a'')}}, the field transforms according to the rule\n\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>U(\\Lambda ,a)\\Psi_{p_1\\sigma_1 n_1;p_2\\sigma_2 n_2\\cdots} = e^{-ia_\\mu((\\Lambda p_1)^\\mu + (\\Lambda p_2)^\\mu + \\cdots)}\n\\sqrt{\\frac{(\\Lambda p_1)^0(\\Lambda p_2)^0\\cdots}{p_1^0p_2^0\\cdots}}\\sum_{\\sigma_1'\\sigma_2'\\cdots}\nD_{\\sigma_1'\\sigma_1}^{(j_1)}(W(\\Lambda, p_1))D_{\\sigma_2'\\sigma_2}^{(j_2)}(W(\\Lambda, p_2))\\cdots\n\\Psi_{\\Lambda p_1\\sigma_1' n_1;\\Lambda p_2\\sigma_2' n_2\\cdots},</math>|{{EquationRef|1}}}}\n\nwhere {{math|''W''(\u039b, ''p'')}} is the [[Wigner rotation]] and {{math|''D''<sup>(''j'')</sup>}} is the {{nowrap|{{math|(2''j'' + 1)}}-dimensional}} representation of {{math|SO(3)}}. By putting {{math|\u039b {{=}} 1, ''a'' {{=}} (''\u03c4'', 0, 0, 0)}}, for which {{mvar|''U''}} is {{math|exp(''iH\u03c4'')}}, in {{EquationNote|1|(1)}}, it immediately follows that\n:<math>H\\Psi = E_\\alpha\\Psi, \\quad E_\\alpha = p_1^0 + p_2^0 + \\cdots ,</math>\nso the in  and out states sough after are eigenstates of the full Hamiltonian that are necessarily non-interacting due to the absence of mixed particle energy terms. The discussion in the section above suggests that the in states {{math|\u03a8<sup>+</sup>}} and the out states {{math|\u03a8<sup>\u2212</sup>}} should be such that\n:<math>e^{-iH\\tau}\\int d\\alpha g(\\alpha)\\Psi_\\alpha^\\pm = \\int d\\alpha e^{-iE_\\alpha \\tau}g(\\alpha)\\Psi_\\alpha^\\pm</math>\nfor large positive and negative {{mvar|\u03c4}} has the appearance of the corresponding package, represented by {{math|''g''}}, of free-particle states, {{math|''g''}} assumed smooth and suitably localized in momentum. Wave packages are necessary, else the time evolution will yield only a phase factor indicating free particles, which cannot be the case. The right hand side follows from that the in and out states are eigenstates of the Hamiltonian per above. To formalize this requirement, assume that the full [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] {{mvar|H}} can be divided into two terms, a free-particle Hamiltonian {{math|''H''<sub>0</sub>}} and an interaction {{mvar|V}}, {{math|''H'' {{=}} ''H''<sub>0</sub> + ''V''}} such that the eigenstates {{math|\u03a6<sub>''\u03b3''</sub>}} of {{math|''H''<sub>0</sub>}} have the same appearance as the in- and out-states with respect to normalization and Lorentz transformation properties,\n:<math>H_0\\Phi_\\alpha = E_\\alpha\\Phi_\\alpha,</math>\n:<math>(\\Phi_\\alpha', \\Phi_\\alpha) = \\delta(\\alpha' - \\alpha).</math>\n\nThe in and out states are defined as eigenstates of the full Hamiltonian,\n:<math>H\\Psi_\\alpha^\\pm = E_\\alpha\\Psi_\\alpha^\\pm,</math>\nsatisfying\n:<math>e^{-iH\\tau} \\int d\\alpha g(\\alpha) \\Psi_\\alpha^\\pm \\rightarrow e^{-iH_0\\tau}\\int d\\alpha g(\\alpha) \\Phi_\\alpha.</math>\nfor {{math|''\u03c4'' \u2192 \u2212\u221e}} or {{math|''\u03c4'' \u2192 +\u221e}} respectively. Define\n:<math>\\Omega(\\tau) \\equiv e^{+iH\\tau}e^{-iH_0\\tau},</math>\nthen\n:<math>\\Psi_\\alpha^\\pm = \\Omega(\\mp \\infty)\\Phi_\\alpha.</math>\nThis last expression will work only using wave packages.From these definitions follow that the in and out states are normalized in the same way as the free-particle states,\n:<math>(\\Psi_\\beta^+, \\Psi_\\alpha^+) = (\\Phi_\\beta, \\Phi_\\alpha) = (\\Psi_\\beta^-, \\Psi_\\alpha^-) = \\delta(\\beta - \\alpha),</math>\nand the three sets are unitarily equivalent. Now rewrite the eigenvalue equation,\n:<math>(E_\\alpha - H_0 \\pm i\\epsilon)\\Psi_\\alpha^\\pm = \\pm i\\epsilon\\Psi_\\alpha^\\pm + V\\Psi_\\alpha^\\pm,</math>\nwhere the {{math|''\u00b1i\u03b5''}} terms has been added to make the operator on the LHS invertible. Since the in and out states reduce to the free-particle states for {{math|''V'' \u2192 0}}, put\n:<math>i\\epsilon\\Psi_\\alpha^\\pm = i\\epsilon\\Phi_\\alpha</math>\non the RHS to obtain\n:<math>\\Psi_\\alpha^\\pm = \\Phi_\\alpha + (E_\\alpha - H_0 \\pm i\\epsilon)^{-1}V\\Psi_\\alpha^\\pm.</math>\nThen use the completeness of the free-particle states,\n:<math>V\\Psi_\\alpha^\\pm = \\int d\\beta (\\Phi_\\beta, V\\Psi_\\alpha^\\pm)\\Phi_\\beta \\equiv \\int d\\beta T_{\\beta\\alpha}^\\pm\\Phi_\\beta,</math>\nto finally obtain\n:<math>\\Psi_\\alpha^\\pm = \\Phi_\\alpha + \\int d\\beta \\frac{T_{\\beta\\alpha}^\\pm\\Phi_\\beta}{E_\\alpha - E_\\beta \\pm i\\epsilon}.</math>\nHere {{math|''H''<sub>0</sub>}} has been replaced by its eigenvalue on the free-particle states. This is the [[Lippmann\u2013Schwinger equation]].\n\n====In states expressed as out states====\nThe initial states can be expanded in a basis of final states (or vice versa).

When his father died in 1509, Garcilaso received a sizeable inheritance.\n\n[[File:Obras de Bosc\u00e1n y Garcilaso de la Vega.jpeg|thumb|left|Cover of ''The works of Bosc\u00e1n and Garcilaso de la Vega in 4 books'', 1543]]\n\nAfter his schooling, he joined the military in hopes of joining the royal guard.

His first lover was Guiomar Carrillo, with whom he had a child. He had another suspected lover named [[:es:Isabel Freyre#M\u00edtico amor de Garcilaso|Isabel Freire]], who was a lady-in-waiting of [[Isabel of Portugal]], but this is today regarded as mythical.<ref>{{cite journal |first=David H. |last=Darst |title=Garcilaso\u00b4s Love for Isabel Freire: The Creation of a Myth |journal=Journal of Hispanic Philology |volume=3 |year=1979 |pages=261-268}}</ref> In 1525, Garcilaso married Elena de Z\u00fa\u00f1iga, who served as a lady-in-waiting for the King's favorite sister, Leonor. Their marriage took place in Garcilaso's hometown of Toledo in one of the family's estates. He had six children: Lorenzo, an illegitimate child with Guiomar Carrillo, Garcilaso, \u00cd\u00f1igo de Z\u00fa\u00f1iga, Pedro de Guzm\u00e1n, Sancha, and Francisco.\n\nGarcilaso's military career meant that he took part in the numerous battles and campaigns conducted by Charles V across Europe. His duties took him to [[Italy]], [[Germany]], [[Tunisia]] and [[France]]. In 1532 for a short period he was exiled to a [[Danube]] island where he was the guest of the Count [[Gy\u00f6rgy Cseszneky]], royal court judge of [[Gy\u0151r]]. Later in France, he would fight his last battle. The King desired to take control of [[Marseille]] and eventually control of the [[Mediterranean Sea]], but this goal was never realized. Garcilaso de la Vega died on 14 October 1536 in [[Nice, France|Nice]], after suffering 25 days from an injury sustained in a battle at [[Le Muy]]. His body was first buried in the Church of St. Dominic in Nice, but two years later his wife had his body moved to the Church of San Pedro Martir in Toledo.\n\n==Works==\nGarcilaso de la Vega is best known for his tragic love poetry that contrasts the playful poetry of his predecessors. He seemed to progress through three distinct episodes of his life which are reflected in his works. During his Spanish period, he wrote the majority of his eight-syllable poems; during his Italian or [[Petrarchan]] period, he wrote mostly sonnets and songs; and during his [[Music of Naples|Neapolitan]] or classicist period, he wrote his other more classical poems, including his elegies, letters, eclogues and odes. Influenced by many Italian Renaissance poets, Garcilaso adapted the eleven-[[syllable]] line to the Spanish language in his ''sonetos'' (sonnets), mostly written in the 1520s, during his Petrarchan period. Increasing the number of syllables in the verse from eight to eleven allowed for greater flexibility. In addition to the ''sonetos'', Garcilaso helped to introduce several other types of [[stanza]]s to the Spanish language. These include the ''[[estancia]]'',  formed by eleven- and seven-syllable lines; the \"[[lira (poetry)|lira]]\", formed by three seven-syllable and two eleven-syllable lines; and ''endecas\u00edlabos sueltos'', formed by unrhymed eleven-syllable lines.\n\n[[File:Apolo y Dafne, soneto XIII, Garcilaso de la Vega.ogg|thumb|Dramatized lecture of Garcilaso's ''[[Apollo and Daphne]]'']]\n\nThroughout his life, Garcilaso de la Vega wrote various poems in each of these types. His works include: forty ''Sonetos'' (Sonnets), five ''Canciones'' (Songs), eight ''Coplas'' (Couplets), three ''\u00c9glogas'' (Eclogues), two ''Eleg\u00edas'' (Elegies), and the ''Ep\u00edstola a Bosc\u00e1n'' (Letter to Bosc\u00e1n). Allusions to classical myths and Greco-Latin figures, great musicality, alliteration, rhythm and an absence of religion characterize his poetry. It can be said that Spanish poetry was never the same after Garcilaso de la Vega. His works have influenced the majority of subsequent Spanish poets, including other major authors of the period like [[Jorge de Montemor]], [[Luis de Le\u00f3n]], [[John of the Cross]], [[Miguel de Cervantes]], [[Lope de Vega]], [[Luis de G\u00f3ngora]] and [[Francisco Quevedo]].\n\nFor example: (\u00e9gloga Tercera):\n\n::::''M\u00e1s a las veces son mejor o\u00eddos''\n::::''el puro ingenio y lengua casi muda,''\n::::''testigos limpios de \u00e1nimo inocente,''\n::::''que la curiosidad del elocuente.''\n\nHe was very good at transmitting the sense of life into writing, in many poems including his \u00ab''dolorido sentir''\u00bb:\n\n::::''No me podr\u00e1n quitar el dolorido''\n::::''sentir, si ya del todo''\n::::''primero no me quitan el sentido''.\n\nWe see the shift in traditional belief of Heaven as influenced by the Renaissance, which is called \"neo-Platonism,\" which tried to lift love to a spiritual, idealistic plane, as compared to the traditional Catholic view of Heaven. (''\u00c9gloga primera''):\n\n::::''Contigo mano a mano''\n::::''busquemos otros prados y otros r\u00edos,''\n::::''otros valles floridos y sombr\u00edos,''\n::::''donde descanse, y siempre pueda verte''\n::::''ante los ojos m\u00edos,''\n::::''sin miedo y sobresalto de perderte.'' (''\u00c9gloga primera'')\n\nHe has enjoyed a revival of influence among 21st century pastoral poets such as [[Seamus Heaney]], [[Dennis Nurkse]], and [[Giannina Braschi]].\n\n==Literary references==\n[[File:Toledo7 (17937739432).jpg|thumb|Monument to Garcilaso in [[Toledo, Spain]] ]]\nGarcilaso is mentioned in multiple works by [[Miguel de Cervantes]].

He had another suspected lover named [[:es:Isabel Freyre#M\u00edtico amor de Garcilaso|Isabel Freire]], who was a lady-in-waiting of [[Isabel of Portugal]], but this is today regarded as mythical.<ref>{{cite journal |first=David H. |last=Darst |title=Garcilaso\u00b4s Love for Isabel Freire: The Creation of a Myth |journal=Journal of Hispanic Philology |volume=3 |year=1979 |pages=261-268}}</ref> In 1525, Garcilaso married Elena de Z\u00fa\u00f1iga, who served as a lady-in-waiting for the King's favorite sister, Leonor. Their marriage took place in Garcilaso's hometown of Toledo in one of the family's estates. He had six children: Lorenzo, an illegitimate child with Guiomar Carrillo, Garcilaso, \u00cd\u00f1igo de Z\u00fa\u00f1iga, Pedro de Guzm\u00e1n, Sancha, and Francisco.\n\nGarcilaso's military career meant that he took part in the numerous battles and campaigns conducted by Charles V across Europe. His duties took him to [[Italy]], [[Germany]], [[Tunisia]] and [[France]]. In 1532 for a short period he was exiled to a [[Danube]] island where he was the guest of the Count [[Gy\u00f6rgy Cseszneky]], royal court judge of [[Gy\u0151r]]. Later in France, he would fight his last battle. The King desired to take control of [[Marseille]] and eventually control of the [[Mediterranean Sea]], but this goal was never realized. Garcilaso de la Vega died on 14 October 1536 in [[Nice, France|Nice]], after suffering 25 days from an injury sustained in a battle at [[Le Muy]]. His body was first buried in the Church of St. Dominic in Nice, but two years later his wife had his body moved to the Church of San Pedro Martir in Toledo.\n\n==Works==\nGarcilaso de la Vega is best known for his tragic love poetry that contrasts the playful poetry of his predecessors. He seemed to progress through three distinct episodes of his life which are reflected in his works. During his Spanish period, he wrote the majority of his eight-syllable poems; during his Italian or [[Petrarchan]] period, he wrote mostly sonnets and songs; and during his [[Music of Naples|Neapolitan]] or classicist period, he wrote his other more classical poems, including his elegies, letters, eclogues and odes. Influenced by many Italian Renaissance poets, Garcilaso adapted the eleven-[[syllable]] line to the Spanish language in his ''sonetos'' (sonnets), mostly written in the 1520s, during his Petrarchan period. Increasing the number of syllables in the verse from eight to eleven allowed for greater flexibility. In addition to the ''sonetos'', Garcilaso helped to introduce several other types of [[stanza]]s to the Spanish language. These include the ''[[estancia]]'',  formed by eleven- and seven-syllable lines; the \"[[lira (poetry)|lira]]\", formed by three seven-syllable and two eleven-syllable lines; and ''endecas\u00edlabos sueltos'', formed by unrhymed eleven-syllable lines.\n\n[[File:Apolo y Dafne, soneto XIII, Garcilaso de la Vega.ogg|thumb|Dramatized lecture of Garcilaso's ''[[Apollo and Daphne]]'']]\n\nThroughout his life, Garcilaso de la Vega wrote various poems in each of these types. His works include: forty ''Sonetos'' (Sonnets), five ''Canciones'' (Songs), eight ''Coplas'' (Couplets), three ''\u00c9glogas'' (Eclogues), two ''Eleg\u00edas'' (Elegies), and the ''Ep\u00edstola a Bosc\u00e1n'' (Letter to Bosc\u00e1n). Allusions to classical myths and Greco-Latin figures, great musicality, alliteration, rhythm and an absence of religion characterize his poetry. It can be said that Spanish poetry was never the same after Garcilaso de la Vega. His works have influenced the majority of subsequent Spanish poets, including other major authors of the period like [[Jorge de Montemor]], [[Luis de Le\u00f3n]], [[John of the Cross]], [[Miguel de Cervantes]], [[Lope de Vega]], [[Luis de G\u00f3ngora]] and [[Francisco Quevedo]].\n\nFor example: (\u00e9gloga Tercera):\n\n::::''M\u00e1s a las veces son mejor o\u00eddos''\n::::''el puro ingenio y lengua casi muda,''\n::::''testigos limpios de \u00e1nimo inocente,''\n::::''que la curiosidad del elocuente.''\n\nHe was very good at transmitting the sense of life into writing, in many poems including his \u00ab''dolorido sentir''\u00bb:\n\n::::''No me podr\u00e1n quitar el dolorido''\n::::''sentir, si ya del todo''\n::::''primero no me quitan el sentido''.\n\nWe see the shift in traditional belief of Heaven as influenced by the Renaissance, which is called \"neo-Platonism,\" which tried to lift love to a spiritual, idealistic plane, as compared to the traditional Catholic view of Heaven. (''\u00c9gloga primera''):\n\n::::''Contigo mano a mano''\n::::''busquemos otros prados y otros r\u00edos,''\n::::''otros valles floridos y sombr\u00edos,''\n::::''donde descanse, y siempre pueda verte''\n::::''ante los ojos m\u00edos,''\n::::''sin miedo y sobresalto de perderte.'' (''\u00c9gloga primera'')\n\nHe has enjoyed a revival of influence among 21st century pastoral poets such as [[Seamus Heaney]], [[Dennis Nurkse]], and [[Giannina Braschi]].\n\n==Literary references==\n[[File:Toledo7 (17937739432).jpg|thumb|Monument to Garcilaso in [[Toledo, Spain]] ]]\nGarcilaso is mentioned in multiple works by [[Miguel de Cervantes]].

In the novel, which takes place in 18th-century colonial Colombia, Delaura is forced to give up being a priest because of his tragic love affair.\n\nPuerto Rican poet [[Giannina Braschi]] wrote both a poetic treatise on Garcilaso de la Vega's ''Eclogues'', as well as a book of poems in homage to the Spanish master, entitled ''Empire of Dreams''.\n\n==Modern translations==\n* ''The Odes and Sonnets of Garcilaso de la Vega'', trans James Cleugh, (London: Aquila, 1930)\n\n== Further reading ==\n* Creel, Bryant. \"Garcilaso de la Vega\".

There have been a number of other theories for the origin of the name ''Oulu''. One possible source is a word in the [[Sami languages|Sami language]] meaning 'flood water', but there are other suggestions. At minimum, the structure of the word requires that, if originally given by speakers of a [[Uralic languages|Uralic]] language, the name must be a [[Derivation (linguistics)|derivative]]. In all likelihood, it also predates Finnish settlement and is thus a [[loanword]] from one of the now-extinct [[Sami languages|Saami languages]] once spoken in the area.\n\nThe most probable theory is that the name derives from the Finnish dialectal word ''oulu'', meaning \"[[floodwater]]\", which is related to e.g. [[Southern Sami language|Southern Sami]] ''\u00e5ulo'', meaning \"melted snow\", ''\u00e5ulot'' meaning \"thaw\" (of unknown ultimate origin). Two other word families have also been speculated to be related. The first is seen in the Northern Savo dialectal word ''uula'' and its Sami counterpart ''oalli'', both meaning \"river channel\". The second is the Uralic root [[Linguistic reconstruction|reconstructed]] as *''uwa'', meaning \"river bed\" (reflected as ''vuo'' in modern Finnish, also in derivatives such as ''vuolas'' \"heavy-flowing\"). To either of these roots, some Sami variety would have to be assumed having added further derivational suffixes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://scripta.kotus.fi/www/verkkojulkaisut/julk125/oulunsalo/oulun_etymologia.shtml |title=Oulu-nimen etymologia |website=Scripta.kotus.fi |date= |accessdate=2011-09-16}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Oulu1800.jpg|thumb|left|Drawing of central Oulu from the 19th Century]]\nOulu is situated by the [[Gulf of Bothnia]], at the mouth of river [[Oulujoki]], which is an ancient trading site. The city proper was founded on 8 April 1605 by King [[Charles IX of Sweden]], opposite the fort built on the island of Linnansaari. This took place after favourable peace settlements with Russia, which removed the threat of attack via the main east-west waterway, the river Oulu. {{citation needed|date=December 2014}} The surrounding areas were populated much earlier. Oulu was the capital of the [[Province of Oulu]] from 1776 to 2009.\n\nIn 1822, a major fire destroyed much of the city. {{citation needed|date=December 2014}} The architect [[Carl Ludvig Engel]], chiefly known for the [[neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] (empire style) buildings around [[Helsinki Senate Square]], was enlisted to provide the plan for its rebuilding. With minor changes, this plan remains the basis for the layout of Oulu's town center. The [[Oulu Cathedral]] was built in 1832 to his designs, with the spire being finished in 1844. During the [[Crimean War]], Oulu's harbour was raided by the British fleet, who destroyed ships and burned tar houses, leading to international criticism.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\nOnce known for [[tar|wood tar]] and [[salmon]], Oulu has evolved into a major high-tech centre, particularly in [[Information technology|IT]] and [[Wellness (alternative medicine)|wellness]] technology. Other prominent industries include wood refining, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, paper, and steel. {{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nThe municipality of [[Ylikiiminki]] was merged with the city of Oulu on 1 January 2009.

name=\"population_count\"/> in the region of [[North Ostrobothnia]], [[Finland]]. It is the most populous city in Northern Finland, and the fifth most populous in the country. Only the city of [[Murmansk]], Russia, has more people and is further north.\n\nOulu is considered one of Europe's \"living labs\", where residents experiment with new technology (such as [[Near-field communication|NFC tags]] and [[Ubiquitous computing|ubi]]-screens) on a community-wide scale.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Mobile Wave: How Mobile Intelligence Will Change Everything |last=Saylor |first=Michael |year=2012 |publisher=Perseus Books/Vanguard Press |isbn= |page=63 }}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe city is named after the river [[Oulujoki]], which originates in the lake [[Ouluj\u00e4rvi]]. There have been a number of other theories for the origin of the name ''Oulu''. One possible source is a word in the [[Sami languages|Sami language]] meaning 'flood water', but there are other suggestions. At minimum, the structure of the word requires that, if originally given by speakers of a [[Uralic languages|Uralic]] language, the name must be a [[Derivation (linguistics)|derivative]]. In all likelihood, it also predates Finnish settlement and is thus a [[loanword]] from one of the now-extinct [[Sami languages|Saami languages]] once spoken in the area.\n\nThe most probable theory is that the name derives from the Finnish dialectal word ''oulu'', meaning \"[[floodwater]]\", which is related to e.g. [[Southern Sami language|Southern Sami]] ''\u00e5ulo'', meaning \"melted snow\", ''\u00e5ulot'' meaning \"thaw\" (of unknown ultimate origin). Two other word families have also been speculated to be related. The first is seen in the Northern Savo dialectal word ''uula'' and its Sami counterpart ''oalli'', both meaning \"river channel\". The second is the Uralic root [[Linguistic reconstruction|reconstructed]] as *''uwa'', meaning \"river bed\" (reflected as ''vuo'' in modern Finnish, also in derivatives such as ''vuolas'' \"heavy-flowing\"). To either of these roots, some Sami variety would have to be assumed having added further derivational suffixes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://scripta.kotus.fi/www/verkkojulkaisut/julk125/oulunsalo/oulun_etymologia.shtml |title=Oulu-nimen etymologia |website=Scripta.kotus.fi |date= |accessdate=2011-09-16}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Oulu1800.jpg|thumb|left|Drawing of central Oulu from the 19th Century]]\nOulu is situated by the [[Gulf of Bothnia]], at the mouth of river [[Oulujoki]], which is an ancient trading site. The city proper was founded on 8 April 1605 by King [[Charles IX of Sweden]], opposite the fort built on the island of Linnansaari. This took place after favourable peace settlements with Russia, which removed the threat of attack via the main east-west waterway, the river Oulu. {{citation needed|date=December 2014}} The surrounding areas were populated much earlier. Oulu was the capital of the [[Province of Oulu]] from 1776 to 2009.\n\nIn 1822, a major fire destroyed much of the city. {{citation needed|date=December 2014}} The architect [[Carl Ludvig Engel]], chiefly known for the [[neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] (empire style) buildings around [[Helsinki Senate Square]], was enlisted to provide the plan for its rebuilding. With minor changes, this plan remains the basis for the layout of Oulu's town center. The [[Oulu Cathedral]] was built in 1832 to his designs, with the spire being finished in 1844. During the [[Crimean War]], Oulu's harbour was raided by the British fleet, who destroyed ships and burned tar houses, leading to international criticism.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\nOnce known for [[tar|wood tar]] and [[salmon]], Oulu has evolved into a major high-tech centre, particularly in [[Information technology|IT]] and [[Wellness (alternative medicine)|wellness]] technology. Other prominent industries include wood refining, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, paper, and steel. {{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nThe municipality of [[Ylikiiminki]] was merged with the city of Oulu on 1 January 2009. Oulu and the municipalities of [[Haukipudas]], [[Kiiminki]], [[Oulunsalo]], and [[Yli-Ii]] were merged on 1 January 2013.<ref name=\"uusioulu\">{{cite web|title=Uusi Oulu|url=http://www.ouka.fi/uusioulu/|publisher=City of Oulu|accessdate=19 September 2011|location=Oulu|language=Finnish|trans-title=New Oulu | date=9 September 2011}}</ref>\n\nOulu was the site of the 2018 [[Oulu child sexual exploitation scandal]].

Mainland Finland's northernmost and southernmost points are roughly [[equidistant]] from Oulu. Oulu's coast sits at the [[Bothnian Bay]] (''Per\u00e4meri'' in Finnish) and the [[Sweden|Swedish mainland]] is about 180&nbsp;km directly west across the Bothnian Bay. The nearby island [[Hailuoto]] is just off the coast.\n\n===Subdivisions===\n{{Category see also|Districts of Oulu}}\nOulu is divided into 106 city districts.

It lies in the [[Wakhan corridor]], on the border between Afghanistan's [[Badakhshan Province]] and [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]]. It is the highest point in Afghanistan and is the world's westernmost 7,000 meter massif.\n\nThe main peak and Noshaq West (7250 m) are on the Afghanistan-Pakistan border lying within Pakistan but also bordering Afghanistan (the [[Durand Line]]), a watershed divide. The other peaks of this massif lie well within Pakistan. These all are easily accessible from Chitral, 64&nbsp;km away. The west side of the massif is in Afghanistan whereas the south and eastern sides are in Pakistan. The second highest peak in this massif is Noshaq East (7480m). The third highest peak of the massif is Noshaq Central (7400m) followed by Noshaq West.\n\n== Access ==\nThe easiest access to Noshaq is from Chitral, Pakistan which is linked to [[Islamabad]] by flights which take 40 minutes. Alternatively a road trip from Pakistani capital Islamabad to Chitral takes about 11 hours and from the provincial capital Peshawar about 8 hours. The mountain is also accessible from [[Qazi Deh]] village in Afghanistan, but is a 28&nbsp;km journey of about five days. Qazi Deh is 280&nbsp;km away from [[Kabul]], Afghanistan.\n\n== Climbing history ==\nNoshaq main was first climbed by a Japanese expedition in 1960 led by Professor Sakato{{who|date=January 2020|reason=I haven't had the pleasure of meeting the Professor- who do you mean?}}.  Other members of the expedition were Goro Iwatsubo and Toshiaki Sakai.  The climb followed the normal Pakistan approach, the southeast ridge from the [[Qadzi Deh Glacier]].  The normal Afghanistan approach route is by the west ridge.\n\nNoshaq East, Noshaq Central and Noshaq West were first climbed in 1963 by Austrians Dr. Gerald Gruber and Rudolf Pischenger.\n\nThe first winter ascent was 13 February 1973 by [[Tadeusz Piotrowski (mountaineer)|Tadeusz Piotrowski]] and [[Andrzej Zawada]], members of a Polish expedition, via the north face.

It lies in the [[Wakhan corridor]], on the border between Afghanistan's [[Badakhshan Province]] and [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]]. It is the highest point in Afghanistan and is the world's westernmost 7,000 meter massif.\n\nThe main peak and Noshaq West (7250 m) are on the Afghanistan-Pakistan border lying within Pakistan but also bordering Afghanistan (the [[Durand Line]]), a watershed divide. The other peaks of this massif lie well within Pakistan. These all are easily accessible from Chitral, 64&nbsp;km away. The west side of the massif is in Afghanistan whereas the south and eastern sides are in Pakistan. The second highest peak in this massif is Noshaq East (7480m). The third highest peak of the massif is Noshaq Central (7400m) followed by Noshaq West.\n\n== Access ==\nThe easiest access to Noshaq is from Chitral, Pakistan which is linked to [[Islamabad]] by flights which take 40 minutes. Alternatively a road trip from Pakistani capital Islamabad to Chitral takes about 11 hours and from the provincial capital Peshawar about 8 hours. The mountain is also accessible from [[Qazi Deh]] village in Afghanistan, but is a 28&nbsp;km journey of about five days. Qazi Deh is 280&nbsp;km away from [[Kabul]], Afghanistan.\n\n== Climbing history ==\nNoshaq main was first climbed by a Japanese expedition in 1960 led by Professor Sakato{{who|date=January 2020|reason=I haven't had the pleasure of meeting the Professor- who do you mean?}}.  Other members of the expedition were Goro Iwatsubo and Toshiaki Sakai.  The climb followed the normal Pakistan approach, the southeast ridge from the [[Qadzi Deh Glacier]].  The normal Afghanistan approach route is by the west ridge.\n\nNoshaq East, Noshaq Central and Noshaq West were first climbed in 1963 by Austrians Dr. Gerald Gruber and Rudolf Pischenger.\n\nThe first winter ascent was 13 February 1973 by [[Tadeusz Piotrowski (mountaineer)|Tadeusz Piotrowski]] and [[Andrzej Zawada]], members of a Polish expedition, via the north face. It was the world's first winter climb of any 7000 m peak.
