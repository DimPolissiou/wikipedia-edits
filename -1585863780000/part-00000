His son, [[Conrad, Duke of Lorraine|Conrad the Red]], succeeded him as Count in 941. [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|King Otto I]] (the future [[Holy Roman Emperor]]) elevated him to [[Duke of Lorraine]] in 944. He subsequently married [[Liutgard of Saxony (died 953)|Liutgarde]], one of Otto's daughters in 947 and rose to become one of the king's closest allies. The relationship, however deteriorated, when Otto refused to honor a peace treaty Conrad, as Otto's representative, had negotiated with [[Berengar II of Italy]]. Conrad also resented the growing influence of Otto's brother [[Henry I, Duke of Bavaria|Henry I of Bavaria]], whom he regarded a threat to his position. In 953 Conrad joined the king's son [[Liudolf, Duke of Swabia|Liudolf]] in rebellion against Otto. The rebellion was crushed and Conrad was stripped of his ducal title. Conrad and Otto eventually reconciled. Conrad fought alongside Otto and fell in the decisive [[Battle of Lechfeld]] in 955 that put an end to the [[Hungarian invasions of Europe|Hungarian invasions into Europe]]. Conrad was succeeded as Count of Worms in 956 by his son [[Otto of Worms]], who was also the grandson of Otto I. In between 965 and 970 Otto of Worms' first son and Conrad II's father, [[Henry of Speyer]]  was born, of whom only very little is known. He died the age of 20 between 985 and 990.  Conrad II's mother was [[Adelaide of Metz]]. After Henry's death, Adelaide married a Frankish nobleman and the relationship with Conrad declined.<ref name=urku>{{cite web |url= https://www.dmgh.de/de/fs1/object/display/bsb00000448_00011.html?zoom=0.75&leftTab=toc&sortIndex=030:040:0004:010:00:00 |title= Konrad II  |publisher= Monumenta Germaniae Historica  | date= | author= | accessdate= January 29, 2020 }}</ref>\n\nIn 978 [[Otto II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Otto II]] appointed his nephew Otto of Worms as [[Duke of Carinthia]]. He succeeded the rebellious Duke [[Henry III, Duke of Bavaria|Henry I of Carinthia]], who had been deposed after the [[War of the Three Henries (977\u2013978)|War of the Three Henries]]. Upon receiving the ducal title, however, Otto lost his countship at Worms, which was given to Bishop [[Hildebald]], emperor Otto II's imperial chancellor. When Otto II died suddenly in 983, his infant son [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto III]] succeeded him, with his mother [[Theophanu]] serving as regent. Theophanu sought to reconcile the imperial house with Henry I, restoring him as Duke of Carinthia in 985, with Otto of Worms allowed to regain his ancestral position as Count of Worms. However, Otto was allowed to style himself \"Duke of Worms\" and his original territory was expanded according to his rank. Otto of Worms loyally served the new Emperor and received the [[March of Verona]] in 955, as the actual Duchy of Carinthia was given to [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV of Bavaria]]. In 996, Otto III invested Otto of Worms' son Bruno as [[Pope Gregory V]]. When Emperor Otto III died in 1002, both Otto of Worms, Conrad's grandfather, and Henry IV became eligible for Kingship of Germany. In a compromise, Otto withdrew and in return received the Duchy of Carinthia from the newly elected king Henry IV, who ruled as ''Henry II of Germany''.

As Gisela's new husband, Conrad hoped to serve as regent for his minor stepson in the administration of the duchy, seeing it as an opportunity to increase his own rank and subsequently make a claim for his own duchy. Emperor Henry II blocked this attempt by placing the guardianship of Ernest II, and regency over Swabia, in the hands of [[Poppo (Archbishop of Trier)|Archbishop Poppo of Trier]] in 1016.

Gisela also claimed descent from [[Charlemagne]] through both her mother and father. The marriage was opposed by many because of the familial relationship shared by Gisela and Conrad. Both were descendants of  King [[Henry the Fowler|Henry I]] - Conrad in the fifth generation and Gisela in the fourth. According to [[canon law]], marriage was forbidden among relatives from the first to the seventh generation. Though Conrad's marriage differed little from the usual practice of the time, strict canonists frowned upon the marriage and [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Henry II]] relied to this violation of canonical law when he forced Conrad into temporary exile. During this exile, Gisela bore Conrad a son, the future emperor [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry III]], on October 28, 1017.

The dukes of Saxony and Lorraine and his cousin Conrad of Carinthia opposed his rule. In order to strengthen his position, Conrad and Gisela embarked on a royal tour. At [[Augsburg]] Conrad received the support of [[Bruno of Augsburg|Bishop Bruno]] and at [[Strasbourg]] he acquired the support of [[Werner I (Bishop of Strasbourg)|Bishop Werner]]. Both men were brothers of former emperor Henry II and Conrad appointed them to highest office at his court. After visiting Cologne Conrad stopped at [[Aachen]], where he as successor of emmpire's founder [[Charlemagne]], announced to continue the tradition of claim and royal rule of [[East Francia]]. The princes of the [[Duchy of Lorraine]] rejected his claim, though. Conrad then moved north to Saxony, visiting [[Adelaide I, Abbess of Quedlinburg|Abbess Adelaide I of Quedlinburg]] and [[Sophia I, Abbess of Gandersheim|Abbess Sophia I of Gandersheim]], both were daughters of the former [[Otto II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Otto II]]. They supported Conrad, which helped to rally the Saxon nobility behind Conrad. During [[Christmas]] at [[Minden]], the Saxon nobles, led by [[Bernard II, Duke of Saxony|Duke Bernard II]], officially recognized him as royal sovereign. He in turn had vowed to respect and honor the ancient Saxon customs and laws. Conrad and Gisela would remain in Saxony until March 1025, when they moved on to the [[Duchy of Swabia]], celebrating [[Easter]] at [[Augsburg]] and then proceeded on to the [[Duchy of Bavaria]], spending the feast of [[Pentecost]] at [[Regensburg]]. The royal couple finally visited [[Zurich]], where after ten months they ended their royal tour. Conrad then entered Burgundy in order to renew the royal claim, that in 1016, Emperor Henry II had forced upon the childless Burgundian King [[Rudolph III of Burgundy|Rudolph III]] to name him as his heir.<ref name=\"Wolfram2\"/>\n\nConrad needed to address the longstanding ''[[Gandersheim Conflict]]'' as he had assumed the German throne. The decade-old unsettled dispute on who controls [[Gandersheim Abbey]] and its estates dated back to the reign of [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Otto III]]. Both the [[Archbishop of Mainz]] and the [[Bishop of Hildesheim]] claimed authority over the Abbey, that also included the right to invest and anoint the Abbey's nuns. Though Otto III had once eased the tensions among the warring parties by declaring that both bishops would be entitled to anoint the Abbess and her sisters, the conflict still lingered. [[Aribo (archbishop of Mainz)|Archbishop Aribo of Mainz]], the new [[Primate of Germany]], counted on Conrad, who was indebted to Aribo for his support during the royal election. In January 1027, the king summoned a [[synod]] at [[Frankfurt]] to end the dispute, but a conclusion could not be reached. He called another synod in September 1028, which also failed.

The emissaries justified the actions of their fellow citizens by claiming that Pavia had always been loyal to the Italian king, as long as the king was alive and present, and that the revolt had taken place when the Italian throne was vacant. Conrad rejected the argument, that just as a ship remains devoted to its captain after his death, the Empire remains imperial property after the death of an emperor. The kingdom of Italy, according to Conrad, belonged to the empire as a matter of legal right. In his ''[[Constitutio de feudis]]'' (\"Edict on the Benefices of the Italian Kingdom\") of 1038 he would determine his regulations of the feudal contracts in Italy.<ref name=\"Stock1983\">{{cite book|author=Brian Stock|title=The Implications of Literacy: Written Language and Models of Interpretation in the Eleventh and Twelfth Centuries p. 156|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6Ves8Li9LH8C|year=1983|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=0-691-10227-9}}</ref> Conrad also declared that the Ostrogothic palace was property of the Empire and therefore the king had the right to punish those responsible for its destruction.

Conrad's army moved south and a contingent besieged Pavia and blocked all trade in the area, as he continued his campaign. By March 1026, Conrad arrived in [[Milan]] and was crowned with the [[Iron Crown of the Lombards]] by [[Aribert (archbishop of Milan)|Archbishop Aribert of Milan]] as [[King of the Lombards]]. From Milan, Conrad traveled to [[Vercelli]], where he celebrated [[Easter]] with the aged [[Leo of Vercelli|Bishop Leo of Vercelli]], who had been a chief advisor to the late [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Otto III]]. When Leo died a few days later, Archbishop Aribert became the chief supporter of the [[Salian dynasty]] in Italy. With Conrad's assistance, Aribert rose to highest ranking religious office in Italy and oversaw the expansion of the [[Basilica of Sant'Ambrogio]] in Milan. In June 1026, Conrad lead his army to [[Ravenna]], but quartering his soldiers among the Ravennese population caused tensions in the city. Conrad then marched north to mitigate the risk the summer heat might pose to his army. In autumn Conrad left his summer camp in the [[Po valley]] and marched to the Burgundian border. Conrad then celebrated [[Christmas]] at [[Ivrea]]. By the end of winter, the Italian aristocrats voluntarily ended their opposition to Conrad's reign.

On April 6, 1027, at a [[synod]] held in the [[Lateran Basilica]] with [[Pope John XIX]], the emperor addressed the matter acknowledging the [[Patriarchate of Aquileia]] superior to the [[Patriarchate of Grado]], an ally of the [[Byzantine Empire]]. The Aquileian [[Poppo of Treffen|Poppo]] had been a loyal supporter of Emperor Henry II, who appointed him patriarch in 1020. Conrad's action placed the patriarchate at Grado under Poppo's authority, securing Poppo's loyalty by making him the Emperor's top official in northern Italy. The synod ended the independence of the Grado church and limited the political autonomy of Venice. In so doing, Conrad broke with the policies of his predecessors and revoked Venice's privileged trading status.<ref name=\"Schutz2010\"/>\n\nIn May 1027 Conrad returned to Germany in order to attend the funeral of [[Henry V, Duke of Bavaria|Duke Henry V of Bavaria]] at [[Regensburg]]. Conrad asserted his right to appoint the new [[Duchy of Bavaria|Duke of Bavaria]]. He made the unprecedented decision of chosing his 10-year-old son [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry]], ignoring several suitable candidates who held valid claims to the fief.\n\nThe young prince assumed Bavarian rule on 24 June 1027. Following Henry's appointment, Conrad held court at Regensburg and issued a decree, that all imperial property in the duchy must be documented. This required the various counts and bishops to list and report all imperial property in their domains, castles and abbeys. Even the [[Dowager Empress]] [[Cunigunde of Luxembourg]] was required to report to Conrad, who even claimed that Cunegonde's ''[[wittum]]'' (money and property she had inherited from her deceased husband Emperor Henry II) belonged to him. These dubious claims to property and the excessive promotion of imperial authority over the ducal and clerical affairs throughout Bavaria caused, unsurprisingly, new tension between him and the German aristocracy.{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=114}}<ref name=brit/>\n\n===Uprising in Swabia===\n[[File:MPano 07.jpg|thumb|200px|left|The [[Konstanz Minster]], seat of the [[Bishop of Constance]]]]\n[[File:Oberfalkenstein.jpg|thumb|200px|left|ruins of the ''Upper Falkenstein Castle'', 2008]]\nIn 1025, [[Ernest II, Duke of Swabia|Duke Ernest II of Swabia]], Conrad's stepson from his marriage to [[Gisela of Swabia]], rebelled against his stepfather when he was elected king of Germany.

During the expedition, the rebellion led by [[Conrad II, Duke of Carinthia|Conrad of Carinthia]] and [[Welf II, Count of Swabia|Count Welf II of Swabia]] continued. Conrad had named [[Bruno of Augsburg|Bishop Bruno of Augsburg]] regent of Germany while he marched south to Italy.  When Bruno was defeated by the rebels, Conrad sent Ernest back to Germany in September 1026 to end the revolt. When Ernest returned, he joined the opposition and rebelled against Conrad again.\n\nIn 1027 Conrad returned to Germany after his imperial coronation and held court at [[Augsburg]], calling upon the rebels to surrender. Ernest, trusting in the number and fidelity of his vassals, rejected the peace offer and appealed to his Swabian counts to join him in the rebellion. According to [[Wipo of Burgundy]], the counts refused, stating that while they had sworn loyalty to Ernest, they would not rebel against their Emperor. Without the support of the Swabian counts, Ernest, Conrad of Carinthia and Count Welf surrendered to Conrad at [[Worms, Germany|Worms]] on September 9, 1027, ending the rebellion. Conrad stripped Ernest of his ducal title and imprisoned him at [[Giebichenstein Castle]] in [[Duchy of Saxony|Saxony]]. Gisela supported Conrad against her son, but did not want Ernest to be entirely humiliated. As a result of his mother's intervention, Conrad allowed Ernest to retain his title while imprisoned, with Gisela serving as regent over the duchy.<ref name=\"Schutz2010\"/>\n\nIn 1028, after Conrad's son [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry]] was crowned in Aachen as King of Germany, Gisela again intervened on Ernest's behalf. Conrad pardoned Ernest and released him from prison in 1028, but Gisela retained regency over Swabia. Ernest served as duke in name only. On Easter 1030, Conrad offered to restore Ernest his full powers as Duke of Swabia if he would crack down on the Emperor's enemies there. Ernest's refusal, especially against his friend Count Werner of Kyburg, resulted in his final downfall. Conrad stripped his stepson of his title, declared him a public enemy, and had him [[excommunicated]]. Even his mother Gisela did not come to his rescue. Within a few months, both Ernest and Werner, who had retreated to ''Falkenstein Castle'', south of modern [[Schramberg]] in the [[Black Forest]] were killed in a battle against a contingent of the [[Bishop of Constance]]. The fall of Ernest greatly weakened the sovereignty of Swabia. Conrad appointed Ernest's younger brother [[Herman IV, Duke of Swabia|Herman]] as new Swabian prince. As Herman was still an infant, the Bishop of Constance was assigned his regent. Eight years later in 1038, Herman died and Conrad installed his own son Henry as duke, securing imperial control over the duchy.<ref name=\"Schutz2010\"/>\n\n===Conflict with Adalbero===\nConrad had to enforce his [[royal prerogative]]s in the [[Duchy of Carinthia]] and the [[Duchy of Swabia]]. [[Adalbero, Duke of Carinthia|Duke Adalbero of Carinthia]] had been appointed as duke in 1012 under Emperor Henry II and remained loyal to imperial authority, supporting Conrad's election as German king in 1024. At a [[synod]] in [[Frankfurt]] in September 1027, Conrad attempted to resolve the decades' long ''Gandersheim Conflict''. Adalbero accompanied the Emperor and acted as his sword-bearer during the proceeding, indicating Conrad's trust in him. From 1028 on, Adalbero governed his Duchy as an independent state.\n\nIn particular, he attempted to conduct peaceful relations with the [[Stephen I of Hungary|King Stephen I]] of the [[Kingdom of Hungary (1000\u20131301)|Kingdom of Hungary]]. Under Emperor Henry II, who was the brother-in-law to Stephen, relations between the Empire and Hungary had been friendly. Upon Henry's death in 1024, Conrad adopted a more aggressive policy, prompting border raids into the Empire from Hungary. The raids particularly affected Adalbero's domain of Carinthia, which shared a long, eastern border with Hungary.{{sfn|Gy\u00f6rffy|1994|p= 140}}{{sfn|Makk|2001|p=45}}\n\nConrad summoned Adalbero to court at [[Bamberg]] on 18 May 1035, to answer an indictment of [[treason]] for his actions regarding Hungary. In the presence of the German dukes, Conrad demanded that Adalbero be stripped of all his titles and lands. The dukes hesitated and demanded that Conrad's son [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry]], the Germany's co-King and Conrad's designated successor, join the assembly before a decision was made. Henry refused to depose Adalbero, citing an earlier agreement with Adelbero to be his ally in negotiating a settlement between him and his father. Conrad resorted to exhortations, pleas, and threats to convince Henry to support Adalbero's deposition. Henry's support was soon followed by that of the other dukes. Conrad then ordered Adalbero to be removed as Duke and sentenced him and his son to [[exile]]. After attacking Conrad's allies in Carinthia, Adalbero fled to his mother's estates in [[Ebersberg]] in the [[Duchy of Bavaria]], where he remained until his death in 1039. The duchy of Carinthia remained unoccupied until February 2, 1035, when Conrad named his cousin [[Conrad II, Duke of Carinthia|Conrad the Younger]] as the new duke. With the appointment, the three southern German duchies of Swabia, Bavaria, and Carinthia were all under the control of Emperor Conrad through his family members (his stepson Herman in Swabia, his son Henry in Bavaria, and his cousin Conrad in Carinthia).{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=84}}\n\nControl of the southern duchies allowed Conrad to continue the process begun under the [[Ottonian dynasty]], centralizing the Emperors authority over the Empire at the expense of the regional dukes. Conrad broke with Ottonian tradition, however, in favoring a more strict means of controlling rebellious vassals. Whereas the Ottonians followed a policy of informal public submission and subsequent reconciliation, Conrad used treason trials to declare rebels as \"public enemies\" to legitimize his subsequent harsh treatment, as he had done with [[Ernest II, Duke of Swabia|Ernest II of Swabia]] and Adalbero. The nobles saw use of these treason trials not as mere power shifts in favor of the Emperor, but as a cruel breach of German tradition.{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=88}}\n\n===Policy towards the Church===\n[[File:Bischof Poppo von Trier.png|thumb|[[Prince-bishop]] [[Poppo (archbishop of Trier)|Poppo von Babenberg]] was [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Trier|archbishop of Trier]] and imperial prince of the [[Electorate of Trier]]]]\nConrad continued the [[Ottonian dynasty]]'s [[Imperial Church System]] - a policy of using the German Church as a vehicle for imperial control. Beginning in the 950s, the Ottonians had favored Church officials over secular nobles for appointment to the Empire's most important offices. Claiming \"[[divine right of king|divine right]]\" to rule the Empire, the Ottonians increasingly viewed themselves as [[defender of the faith|protectors of the Church]] and thus demanded loyalty from the Church officials.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-ecclesiastical-history/article/imperial-church-system-of-the-ottonian-and-salian-rulers-a-reconsideration/8B8887F785FC72BFD48A4A5DDF8A49C2 |title= The \u2018Imperial Church System\u2019 of the Ottonian and Salian Rulers: a Reconsideration|publisher= Cambridge Org | date=March 25, 2011   | author=Timothy Reuter   | accessdate= January 27, 2020 }}</ref> In return, the various bishoprics and abbeys of the Empire were granted extensive landholdings and secular authority, providing immunity from the jurisdiction of the secular nobles.

Under royal service, the bishops and abbots were required to provide hospitality and accommodations to the Emperor and his court when he arrived. It also required the Church officials to act as quasi-bureaucracy for the Empire. Under military service, the Church was required to supply soldiers for the Emperors' army or to act as diplomats at his direction. Conrad energetically continued this tradition.<ref name=\"Schutz2010\"/><ref name=\"Bernhardt2002\">{{cite book|author=John W.

Conrad and the other members of the [[Salian dynasty]] had little interest in the founding of new monasteries. Through their hundred-year dynasty, the Salians only founded one: [[Limburg Abbey]] which was converted from a fortress to a monastery in 1025.  The Ottonians established at least eight in their hundred-year reign. Additionally, the Ottonians were active in the establishment of Church affairs, but Conrad was uninterested, only calling five [[synods]] during his reign and usually only to restore peace. Conrad's decisions on Church policy were often left to his wife [[Gisela of Swabia]]. When [[Aribo, Archbishop of Mainz|Archbishop Aribo of Mainz]], [[Primate of Germany]], died in 1031, Conrad considered both [[Bardo (bishop)|Abbot Bardo]] of [[Hersfeld Abbey]] and the renowned [[theologian]] [[Wazo of Li\u00e8ge]], then serving as the dean of the [[cathedral chapter]] for the [[Prince-Bishopric of Li\u00e8ge|Bishop of Liege]]. Though Conrad favored Wazo to lead the German Church as Archbishop and Primate, Gisela convinced him to appoint Bardo instead.<ref name=\"M\u00f6llerAmmerich2015\"/>\n\n===Relations with Poland===\n\n====War with Mieszko====\n[[File:Polska 992 - 1025.png|thumb|350px|right|The [[Duchies of Poland|Duchy of Poland]] at its greatest extent under [[Boleslaw I of Poland|Boles\u0142aw I]] and his son [[Mieszko II of Poland|Mieszko II]].]]\n\n[[Boles\u0142aw I Chrobry|Duke Boles\u0142aw I of Poland]] warred with [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Henry II]] three times during the [[German-Polish War (1002\u20131018)|German-Polish Wars from 1002 to 1018]]. In January 1018, Henry II and Boles\u0142aw I signed a peace treaty, known as the [[Peace of Bautzen]],<ref name=Knefelkamp123>Knefelkamp (2002), p. 125</ref> in which the Empire and Poland declared a permanent peace with Boles\u0142aw recognizing Henry II as his nominal feudal lord.<ref name=cmh>Previte-orton, pg. 451</ref> In return, Henry II granted to Boles\u0142aw lands on the Empire's eastern border. To seal the peace, Boles\u0142aw I, a widower, reinforced his dynastic bonds with the German nobility by marrying [[Oda of Meissen]], daughter of the Saxon Margrave Eckard I of Meissen. Empire and Poland remained at peace for the remainder of Henry's reign. Henry's death in 1024 gave Boles\u0142aw an opportunity to increase his own power. Boles\u0142aw took advantage of the interregnum in Germany and crowned himself king on [[Easter]], April 25, 1025. Boles\u0142aw was thus the first Polish king as his predecessors had been considered mere \"dukes\" by both the Empire and the Pope in Rome. Boles\u0142aw died within two months of the coronation, most likely due to an illness. Boles\u0142aw's son, [[Mieszko II Lambert]], succeeded him as King, being crowned on Christmas Day 1025. Upon assuming the Polish throne, Mieszko expelled his older half-brother [[Bezprym]] and his younger brother [[Otto Boles\u0142awowic]]. Otto went to Germany to seek Conrad's protection.{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=209}}\n\nConrad considered the assumption of the title \"king\" by Mieszko an act of war and a disregard of his imperial authority, but had to address domestic issues before marching against Mieszko. In 1026 Conrad II marched into Italy to assert German authority south of the Alps and to claim the imperial crown from the Pope. In his absence, [[Ernest II, Duke of Swabia|Duke Ernest II of Swabia]], [[Conrad II, Duke of Carinthia|Conrad the Younger]], and [[Frederick II, Duke of Upper Lorraine|Duke Frederick II of Upper Lorraine]] rebelled against his authority.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://archive.is/20130701012634/http://bsbndb.bsb.lrz-muenchen.de/sfz58985.html |title= Mathilde von Schwaben  |publisher=  Neue deutsche Biographie | date=  | author=Eckhard Freise    | accessdate= April 1, 2020 }}</ref>\n\nThe rebels sought the support of Mieszko, which the Polish king granted and promised to take military action against Conrad. Conrad returned to Germany in mid-1027, putting an end to the rebellion before Mieszko could marshal his forces. In preparations for his own invasion of Poland, Conrad developed a closer relationship with [[Cnut the Great|Cnut, King of England and Denmark]] (whose kingdom lay along the Empire's northern border). Cnut accompanied Conrad to his coronation as emperor in 1027, and Conrad granted authority over the [[Duchy of Schleswig|March of Schleswig]], the land-bridge between Denmark and Germany.{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=215}}\n\nFearing a joint German-Danish attack, Mieszko invaded the Empire's [[March of Lusatia]] and the territory of the [[Lutici|Lutician Federation]] in 1028.<ref name=Herrmann363>Herrmann (1985), p. 363</ref> The Lutici were a federation of [[West Slavs|West Slavic]] [[Polabian Slavs|Polabian]] tribes that developed in the 10th century. Located on the northeast border of Germany, the Lutici were the regular target of German aggression during the early years of the [[Ottonian dynasty]] with [[Emperor Otto I]]'s lieutenants [[Herman Billung]] and [[Gero]], subjugating many of the Slavic tribes beginning in the 940s. In 983, as part of the [[Great Slav Rising]], the Lutici initiated an open rebellion.  In the ensuing war (983-995), the Lutici succeeded in reclaiming their independence and gained control of the [[Billung March]] and [[Northern March]] from the Empire.<ref name=Luebke99>L\u00fcbke (2002), p. 99</ref> Though [[Emperor Otto III]] allied with [[Boles\u0142aw I Chrobry|Duke Boles\u0142aw I of Poland]] to reintegrate them into the Empire, Otto III's death ended the friendly relationship between Poland the Empire. Instead, Boles\u0142aw competed with Otto III's successor, Emperor Henry II, for dominion over the Lutici, causing Henry II to ally the Empire with the Lutici against Poland. Under the [[Peace of Bautzen]] in 1018, all three parties remained in uneasy peace, with Poland allowed to hold the Empire's [[Margraviate of Meissen]]. Of the eastern marches, the Empire only retained the [[March of Lusatia]]. Mieszko's 1028 invasion ended the peace. The Lutici sent ambassadors to seek Conrad's protection against Mieszko, which Conrad granted and renewed the German-Lutician alliance.<ref name=Herrmann363/>\n\nSeeking to protect the Lutici from Polish invasion, Conrad launched a counter-invasion in 1029 and placed the Polish-held [[Bautzen]] under siege. Faced with a potential invasion by Hungary and the failure of the Lutici to provide their promised contingent of troops, Conrad retreated. In 1030, Poland secured an alliance with Hungary, with Stephen I invading Bavaria while Mieszko invaded Saxony. Conrad responded by allying with [[Yaroslav the Wise]], [[Grand Prince of Kiev]], to attack and capture [[Red Ruthenia]] on Poland's eastern border. In 1031, Conrad concluded a peace treaty with Hungary by ceding territory in eastern [[Duchy of Carinthia|Carinithia]] to Hungarian control. Freed from the threat of Hungarian attack, the Emperor was able to focus his attention on attacking Poland. Marching on Mieszko in autumn 1031, Conrad laid siege at the Polish held-[[Bautzen]] in the [[Margraviate of Meissen]]. Mieszko's authority was shaken by the German and Kieven invasions, and the rebellion led by his exiled brother [[Bezprym]]. Mieszko surrendered to Conrad in fall 1031. Under the [[Treaty of Merseburg]], Mieszko returned control over the [[Margraviate of Meissen]] and the [[March of Lusatia]] to the Empire.<ref name=\"Boshof 2008, p. 71\">Boshof (2008), p. 71</ref>\n\n====Treaty of Merseburg====\n[[File:Wojciech Gerson-Krolowa Ryksa.jpg|thumb|left|19th century painting of king [[Mieszko II Lambert|Mieszko II's]] wife [[Richeza of Lotharingia|Queen Richeza]] (Wojciech Gerson, 1891) ]]\nSoon after Mieszko concluded peace with the Empire, he was deposed by his half-brother [[Bezprym]]. When Mieszko assumed the Polish throne in 1025 he exiled his brother, who fled to the protection of [[Kievan Rus]] to the east of Poland. With Meiszko's position weakened by his wars with the Empire, Bezprym, supported by Conrad, persuaded the Kevian Grand Price [[Yaroslav I the Wise]] to invade Poland and install Bezprym as the country's ruler. The Kievan invasion was a success. Mieszko fled to the [[Duchy of Bohemia]] where he was imprisoned and [[castrated]] by [[Old\u0159ich, Duke of Bohemia|Duke Oldrich]] in retribution for Mieszko's father [[Boles\u0142aw I of Poland|Boles\u0142aw]]'s blinding [[Boleslaus III, Duke of Bohemia|Duke Boleslaus III]], Oldrich's brother, thirty years earlier. Shortly after taking power, Bezprym sent the [[Polish Crown Jewels|Polish royal crown and regalia]] to Conrad, officially renouncing the title \"king\" in favor of the traditional title \"duke\" and accepting the overlordship of the Empire over Poland.<ref>Boshof (2008), p. 71</ref> The Royal crown and regalia were delivered by Mieszko II's wife, [[Richeza of Lotharingia|Queen Richeza]].<ref name=\"Halfond2016\"/>\n\nBezprym's reign was short. Bezprym's extreme cruelty caused his half-brother [[Otto Boles\u0142awowic]] to lead a conspiracy. Bezprym's own men murdered him in spring 1032, created a [[power vacuum]] in Poland. Conrad responded by holding an [[hoftag|assembly]] at [[Merseburg]] in 1033 to address the situation. Conrad's wife, the Empress [[Gisela of Swabia]], interceded on Mieszko's behalf and requested he be freed from imprisonment in Bohemia and allowed to regain the Polish throne. Under the terms of the [[Treaty of Merseburg]], Conrad divided Poland between Mieszko, Otto, and another half brother Detric. Mieszko was allowed to retain the title Duke and nominal authority over all of Poland. With a strong central leader to guide it, the treaty significantly increased the Empire's influence over Poland.<ref name=\"Knefelkamp 2002, p. 137\">Knefelkamp (2002), p. 137</ref><ref name=\"Boshof 2008, p. 72\">Boshof (2008), p. 72</ref>\n\nThe division was short-lived: in 1033 Otto was killed by one of his own men, and Mieszko II took his domains. Shortly after, Mieszko expelled Detric, reuniting the whole country in his hands. Though Mieszko regained his former power, he still had to fight against the nobility and his own subjects. Mieszko did not accept Bezprym's renunciation of the Polish crown and continued to style himself as \"King\" instead of \"Duke\". Mieszko II died soon after in 1034, and upon his death, a [[Pagan reaction in Poland]] erupted. Subsequently, his wife [[Richeza of Lotharingia|Richeza]] and son [[Casimir I of Poland|Casimir I]] fled to Germany.<ref name=\"Knefelkamp 2002, p. 137\"/><ref name=\"Boshof 2008, p. 72\"/>\n\n===Relations with Eastern Europe===\n\n====Bohemia====\nThe [[Duchy of Bohemia]] was incorporated into the Holy Roman Empire in 1004 during the [[German-Polish War (1002\u20131018)|German-Polish Wars]], which stretched from 1002 to 1018. [[Emperor Henry II]] installed [[Jarom\u00edr, Duke of Bohemia|Jaromir]] as [[Duke of Bohemia]] and promised protection against Polish aggression in return for incorporation. Jaromir ruled only a smaller territory, however, as Poland occupied the traditional Czech territories of [[Moravia]], [[Silesia]], [[Lesser Poland]] and [[Lusatia]]. In 1012, Jaromir was deposed by his brother [[Old\u0159ich, Duke of Bohemia|Oldrich]], who assumed the Bohemian throne for himself. Following the resumption of hostilities between the Empire and Poland in 1028, Oldrich went on the offensive against Poland, reconquering Moravia by 1029, which helped to stabilize his duchy. The war ended in 1031 when Polish King [[Mieszko II of Poland|Mieszko II]] surrendered to Conrad. In the civil war which followed, Meiszko was forced to flee Poland for Bohemia, where Oldrich had him imprisoned and castrated in revenge for the torture Meiszko's father, [[Boles\u0142aw I of Poland]], inflicted upon [[Boleslaus III, Duke of Bohemia|Duke Boleslaus III]], Oldrich's brother, thirty years before.<ref name=\"Prague09\">{{cite book|author1=Cosmas (of Prague)|author2=Cosmas of Prague|author3=C\u00f4me de Prague|title=The Chronicle of the Czechs|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZG7igBN41oUC&pg=PA105|year=2009|publisher=CUA Press|isbn=978-0-8132-1570-9|pages=105\u2013}}</ref>\n\nPoland was unable to stabilize in the wake of Mieszko's exile, forcing Conrad to convene an assembly in July 1033 to issue the [[Treaty of Merseburg]] which restored Meiszko to the Polish throne. Conrad summoned Oldrich to appear to the assembly, but Oldrich refused. His absence raised the ire of the Emperor and Conrad, busy with securing his succession to the Burgundy throne, charged his son [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Duke Henry of Bavaria]] with punishing the recalcitrant Bohemian. At age 17, Henry's march on Bohemia was his first independent military command. The expedition was complete success, with Henry deposing Oldrich and restoring his brother Jaromir to the Bohemian throne, with Oldrich's son [[Bretislaus I, Duke of Bohemia|Bretislaus I]] appointed as Count of [[Moravia]].

Conrad's rival to the Burgundian throne, Count Odo II of Blois had already invaded the kingdom to secure his rule and controlled large sections of the kingdom's western territories.{{sfn|Previt\u00e9-Orton|1912|p=30}} On February 2, 1033, Conrad arrived at [[Vaud]], where he held an assembly at the [[Payerne Priory|Abbey of Payerne]] and was crowned King of Burgundy.{{sfn|Previt\u00e9-Orton|1912|p=32}} Initially, Conrad made little progress against Odo and had to withdraw to [[Zurich]] in March.{{sfn|Previt\u00e9-Orton|1912|p=32}}  In two large-scale military summer campaigns in 1033 and 1034, Conrad defeated Odo.{{sfn|Previt\u00e9-Orton|1912|p=33-36}} On August 1, 1034, Conrad officially incorporated Burgundy into the [[Holy Roman Empire]] at a ceremony held in the [[St. Pierre Cathedral|Cathedral of Geneva]].{{sfn|Previt\u00e9-Orton|1912|p=33-36}}\n\nThough Burgundy had been brought under full imperial control, the kingdom was allowed a remarkable degree of autonomy. Conrad rarely intervened in its affairs following his coronation, returning only in 1038 to announce his son [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry]] as the kingdom's future ruler. Of central significance in the conquest of Burgundy was to augment the influence and dignity of the Emperor to the benefit of the Empire. With Burgundy secured, Conrad controlled the western Alpine passes into Italy and block foreign invasions.{{sfn|Previt\u00e9-Orton|1912|p=40}}\n\n==Politics==\n[[File:Conrad II et prince imp\u00e9rial, vitrail roman, Cath\u00e9drale de Strasbourg.jpg|thumb|160px|left|Conrad II, 12th-century stained glass window, [[Strasbourg Cathedral]]]]\n[[Image:Ottonian Salian dynasty.png|thumb|280px|Salian family tree]]\n\nConrad formally confirmed the popular [[legal]] traditions of [[Saxony]] and issued new constitutions for [[Lombardy]]. In 1028 at [[Aachen]], he had his son Henry elected and anointed king of [[Germany]]. Henry married [[Gunhilda of Denmark]], daughter of King [[Canute the Great]] of [[England]], [[Denmark]], and [[Norway]] by [[Emma of Normandy]]. This was an arrangement that Conrad had made many years prior, when he gave Canute parts of northern Germany to administer.<ref name=\"Bolton2017\">{{cite book|author=Timothy Bolton|title=Cnut the Great p. 162|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5ssCDgAAQBAJ|year=2017|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-20833-7}}</ref> Henry, who would later become Emperor [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry III]], became his father's chief counselor.\n<!-- likely redundant paragraphs:\n\nConrad campaigned unsuccessfully against [[Poland]] in 1028\u20131030. In 1031, Conrad and the [[Kievan Rus']] forced King [[Mieszko II of Poland|Mieszko II]], son and heir of [[Boleslaw I of Poland|Boles\u0142aw I]], to make peace and return the land that Boles\u0142aw had taken from the Empire during the reign of Henry II. Mieszko II was compelled to give up his royal title, and for the remainder of his troubled rule became the Duke of Poland and Conrad's vassal.\n\nIn 1029 some [[Bavaria]]n border conflicts undermined the good relations with [[Stephen I of Hungary]]. One year later Conrad launched a campaign against [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]]. The Hungarians successfully used [[Scorched earth|scorched earth tactics]], and Conrad had to withdraw his army. Finally, the Hungarian army forced him to surrender at [[Vienna]]. After his defeat, Conrad was obliged to cede some border territory to Hungary.\n\n-->\n\nWhen [[Rudolph III, King of Burgundy]] died on February 2, 1032, Conrad claimed the Kingship on the basis of an inheritance that Henry II had extorted from Rudolph in 1006, after Henry invaded [[Kingdom of Burgundy|Burgundy]] to enforce his claim in 1016. Despite some opposition, the Burgundian and Proven\u00e7al nobles paid homage to Conrad in [[Z\u00fcrich]] in 1034. This Kingdom of Burgundy, later known as the [[Kingdom of Arles]] under Conrad's successors, corresponded to most of the southeastern quarter of modern France and included western Switzerland, the Franche-Comt\u00e9, and Dauphin\u00e9. It did not include the smaller [[Duchy of Burgundy]] to the north, ruled by a cadet branch of the Capetian [[King of France]]. (Most of the former Kingdom of Arles was incorporated into France piecemeal over the next centuries, but the King of Arles remained one of the Holy Roman Emperor's subsidiary titles until the dissolution of the Empire in 1806.)\n\nConrad upheld the rights of the ''valvassores'' (knights and burghers of the cities) of [[Italy]] against Archbishop Aribert of Milan and the local nobles. The nobles, as vassal lords, and the [[bishop]] had conspired to rescind rights from the burghers. Conrad restored order with skillful diplomacy and luck.<ref name=\"M\u00f6llerAmmerich2015\"/>\n\n==Late life==\n\n===Securing the imperial succession===\nOn 14 January 1040 Conrad II's heir Henry issued a charter, in which he announced his official designation as of ''Rex romanorum'' - King of the Romans. Thus he effectively elevates the traditional Frankish kingship to Imperial authority. By this assignment only, one reserves the rights for the office of Holy Roman Emperor.<ref name=\"Weinfurter19\"/><ref name=brit/>\n\n===Second Italian expedition===\n\nIn 1038, Prince [[Guaimar IV of Salerno]] requested that Conrad adjudicate in a dispute over [[Capua]] with its Prince [[Pandulf IV of Capua|Pandulf]], whom Conrad had released from imprisonment in 1024, immediately after his coronation. Hearing that [[Michael IV the Paphlagonian]] of the [[Byzantine Empire]] had received the same request, Conrad went to [[Southern Italy]], to [[Salerno]] and [[Aversa]]. He appointed Richer, from Germany, as abbot of [[Monte Cassino]], as abbot Theobald was imprisoned by Pandulf. At [[Troia (FG)|Troia]], he ordered Pandulf to restore stolen property to Monte Cassino. Pandulf sent his wife and son to ask for peace, offering {{convert|300|lb|kg|abbr=on}} of gold and two of his children as hostages. The Emperor accepted Pandulf's offer, but the hostages escaped as Pandulf hid in his outlying castle of [[Sant'Agata de' Goti]]. Conrad besieged and conquered Capua and bestowed the place and the title of ''Prince'' on Guaimar. He also recognized Aversa as a county of Salerno under [[Rainulf Drengot]], the [[Normans|Norman]] adventurer. Pandulf, meanwhile, fled to [[Constantinople]]. Conrad thus left the ''[[Mezzogiorno]]'' firmly in Guaimar's hands and loyal, for once, to the Holy Roman Empire.<ref name=boni/><ref name=brit/>\n\n===Death===\n[[Image:Grab Konrad II. im Dom zu Speyer.JPG|thumb|150px|Conrad II's tomb in the [[Speyer Cathedral]]]]\nDuring the return to Germany a severe epidemic decimated the ranks of the troops. Conrad's daughter-in-law and stepson died. Conrad himself returned home safely and held court on important occasions in [[Solothurn]], [[Strasbourg]], and [[Goslar]].

{{nowrap|'''Conrad the Elder'''}} and {{nowrap|'''Conrad the Salic'''}}, was [[Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] from 1027 until his death in 1039. The first of a succession of four [[Salian dynasty|Salian]] emperors, who reigned for one century until 1125, Conrad also served as [[King of Germany]] from 1024, [[King of Italy]] from 1026, and [[King of Burgundy|King of Burgundy (Arelat)]] from 1033.\n\nThe son of [[Franconia]]n count [[Henry of Speyer]] (also Henry of Worms) and [[Adelaide of Metz]] of the ''Matfriding dynasty'', that had ruled the [[Duchy of Lorraine]] from 959 until 972, Conrad inherited the titles of count of [[Speyer]] and [[Worms, Germany|Worms]] during childhood after his father had died around the year 990. He extended his influence beyond his inherited lands, as he came into favor of the [[Princes of the Holy Roman Empire|princes]] of the kingdom. When the imperial [[Ottonian dynasty|dynastic line]] was left without a successor after [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Henry II's]] death in 1024, on September 4 an assembly of the [[Princes of the Holy Roman Empire|imperial princes]] appointed the 34 year-old Conrad king (''Rex romanorum'').{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=18}}<ref name=\"Weinfurter99\"/>\n\nConrad II largely continued the political course, the ''Renovatio regni Francorum'' of his [[Ottonian dynasty|Ottonian]] predecessor Henry II regarding the role of the Church and the status and affairs of Italy. He proceeded to evolve the [[Proprietary church]] as a basis for imperial power, preferring to appoint clerics over secular lords for important offices throughout the empire. Like Henry II before him, he insisted on his feudal claim (''Honor Imperii''), yet granted Italy a high degree of self-governance, near complete economic autonomy and recognized and respected the political importance and influence of the city of [[Rome]] and its [[Roman Curia|curia]] in particular.<ref name=boni/><ref name=\"Blumenthal1988\">{{cite book|author=Uta-Renate Blumenthal|title=The Investiture Controversy: Church and Monarchy from the Ninth to the Twelfth Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0tZhHot9CuEC&pg=PA45|year=1988|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=0-8122-1386-6|pages=45\u2013}}</ref> His reign marked a high point of medieval imperial rule during a relatively peaceful period for the empire.

His son, [[Conrad, Duke of Lorraine|Conrad the Red]], succeeded him as Count in 941. [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|King Otto I]] (the future [[Holy Roman Emperor]]) elevated him to [[Duke of Lorraine]] in 944. He subsequently married [[Liutgard of Saxony (died 953)|Liutgarde]], one of Otto's daughters in 947 and rose to become one of the king's closest allies. The relationship, however deteriorated, when Otto refused to honor a peace treaty Conrad, as Otto's representative, had negotiated with [[Berengar II of Italy]]. Conrad also resented the growing influence of Otto's brother [[Henry I, Duke of Bavaria|Henry I of Bavaria]], whom he regarded a threat to his position. In 953 Conrad joined the king's son [[Liudolf, Duke of Swabia|Liudolf]] in rebellion against Otto. The rebellion was crushed and Conrad was stripped of his ducal title. Conrad and Otto eventually reconciled. Conrad fought alongside Otto and fell in the decisive [[Battle of Lechfeld]] in 955 that put an end to the [[Hungarian invasions of Europe|Hungarian invasions into Europe]]. Conrad was succeeded as Count of Worms in 956 by his son [[Otto of Worms]], who was also the grandson of Otto I. In between 965 and 970 Otto of Worms' first son and Conrad II's father, [[Henry of Speyer]]  was born, of whom only very little is known. He died the age of 20 between 985 and 990.  Conrad II's mother was [[Adelaide of Metz]]. After Henry's death, Adelaide married a Frankish nobleman and the relationship with Conrad declined.<ref name=urku>{{cite web |url= https://www.dmgh.de/de/fs1/object/display/bsb00000448_00011.html?zoom=0.75&leftTab=toc&sortIndex=030:040:0004:010:00:00 |title= Konrad II  |publisher= Monumenta Germaniae Historica  | date= | author= | accessdate= January 29, 2020 }}</ref>\n\nIn 978 [[Otto II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Otto II]] appointed his nephew Otto of Worms as [[Duke of Carinthia]]. He succeeded the rebellious Duke [[Henry III, Duke of Bavaria|Henry I of Carinthia]], who had been deposed after the [[War of the Three Henries (977\u2013978)|War of the Three Henries]]. Upon receiving the ducal title, however, Otto lost his countship at Worms, which was given to Bishop [[Hildebald]], emperor Otto II's imperial chancellor. When Otto II died suddenly in 983, his infant son [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto III]] succeeded him, with his mother [[Theophanu]] serving as regent. Theophanu sought to reconcile the imperial house with Henry I, restoring him as Duke of Carinthia in 985, with Otto of Worms allowed to regain his ancestral position as Count of Worms. However, Otto was allowed to style himself \"Duke of Worms\" and his original territory was expanded according to his rank. Otto of Worms loyally served the new Emperor and received the [[March of Verona]] in 955, as the actual Duchy of Carinthia was given to [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV of Bavaria]]. In 996, Otto III invested Otto of Worms' son Bruno as [[Pope Gregory V]]. When Emperor Otto III died in 1002, both Otto of Worms, Conrad's grandfather, and Henry IV became eligible for Kingship of Germany. In a compromise, Otto withdrew and in return received the Duchy of Carinthia from the newly elected king Henry IV, who ruled as ''Henry II of Germany''.

Gisela had first been married to [[Brun I, Count of Brunswick|Count Bruno I of Brunswick]] the same year.

The marriage produced two sons: [[Ernest II, Duke of Swabia|Ernest II]] and Herman. After the death of Ernest I in 1015, Emperor Henry II named Ernest II as Duke of Swabia. As Gisela's new husband, Conrad hoped to serve as regent for his minor stepson in the administration of the duchy, seeing it as an opportunity to increase his own rank and subsequently make a claim for his own duchy. Emperor Henry II blocked this attempt by placing the guardianship of Ernest II, and regency over Swabia, in the hands of [[Poppo (Archbishop of Trier)|Archbishop Poppo of Trier]] in 1016.

Her mother, [[Gerberga of Burgundy]], was the daughter of reigning [[Kingdom of Arles|Burgundian King]] [[Conrad of Burgundy]] and granddaughter of the late [[Carolingian Empire|Frankish King]] [[Louis IV of France|Louis IV]]. Gisela also claimed descent from [[Charlemagne]] through both her mother and father. The marriage was opposed by many because of the familial relationship shared by Gisela and Conrad. Both were descendants of  King [[Henry the Fowler|Henry I]] - Conrad in the fifth generation and Gisela in the fourth. According to [[canon law]], marriage was forbidden among relatives from the first to the seventh generation. Though Conrad's marriage differed little from the usual practice of the time, strict canonists frowned upon the marriage and [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Henry II]] relied to this violation of canonical law when he forced Conrad into temporary exile. During this exile, Gisela bore Conrad a son, the future emperor [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry III]], on October 28, 1017.

The dukes of Saxony and Lorraine and his cousin Conrad of Carinthia opposed his rule. In order to strengthen his position, Conrad and Gisela embarked on a royal tour. At [[Augsburg]] Conrad received the support of [[Bruno of Augsburg|Bishop Bruno]] and at [[Strasbourg]] he acquired the support of [[Werner I (Bishop of Strasbourg)|Bishop Werner]]. Both men were brothers of former emperor Henry II and Conrad appointed them to highest office at his court. After visiting Cologne Conrad stopped at [[Aachen]], where he as successor of emmpire's founder [[Charlemagne]], announced to continue the tradition of claim and royal rule of [[East Francia]]. The princes of the [[Duchy of Lorraine]] rejected his claim, though. Conrad then moved north to Saxony, visiting [[Adelaide I, Abbess of Quedlinburg|Abbess Adelaide I of Quedlinburg]] and [[Sophia I, Abbess of Gandersheim|Abbess Sophia I of Gandersheim]], both were daughters of the former [[Otto II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Otto II]]. They supported Conrad, which helped to rally the Saxon nobility behind Conrad. During [[Christmas]] at [[Minden]], the Saxon nobles, led by [[Bernard II, Duke of Saxony|Duke Bernard II]], officially recognized him as royal sovereign. He in turn had vowed to respect and honor the ancient Saxon customs and laws. Conrad and Gisela would remain in Saxony until March 1025, when they moved on to the [[Duchy of Swabia]], celebrating [[Easter]] at [[Augsburg]] and then proceeded on to the [[Duchy of Bavaria]], spending the feast of [[Pentecost]] at [[Regensburg]]. The royal couple finally visited [[Zurich]], where after ten months they ended their royal tour. Conrad then entered Burgundy in order to renew the royal claim, that in 1016, Emperor Henry II had forced upon the childless Burgundian King [[Rudolph III of Burgundy|Rudolph III]] to name him as his heir.<ref name=\"Wolfram2\"/>\n\nConrad needed to address the longstanding ''[[Gandersheim Conflict]]'' as he had assumed the German throne. The decade-old unsettled dispute on who controls [[Gandersheim Abbey]] and its estates dated back to the reign of [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Otto III]]. Both the [[Archbishop of Mainz]] and the [[Bishop of Hildesheim]] claimed authority over the Abbey, that also included the right to invest and anoint the Abbey's nuns. Though Otto III had once eased the tensions among the warring parties by declaring that both bishops would be entitled to anoint the Abbess and her sisters, the conflict still lingered. [[Aribo (archbishop of Mainz)|Archbishop Aribo of Mainz]], the new [[Primate of Germany]], counted on Conrad, who was indebted to Aribo for his support during the royal election. In January 1027, the king summoned a [[synod]] at [[Frankfurt]] to end the dispute, but a conclusion could not be reached. He called another synod in September 1028, which also failed.

In June 1025, bishops from [[Northern Italy]], led by [[Aribert (archbishop of Milan)|Archbishop Aribert of Milan]], crossed the Alps in order to pay homage to Conrad. In exchange for certain administrative privileges, Aribert agreed to crown Conrad [[Iron Crown of Lombardy|King of Italy]]. However,the situation in Italy had become increasingly unstable after the death of the Henry II. Amidst occasional riots many Italian aristocrats demanded the secession of the [[Kingdom of Italy]] from the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. The local aristocrats and merchants now considered the Frankish role of protecttors against the Maurian and Byzantine threat to be obsolete. The Italian throne was now viewed as vacant and not available for Conrad's automatic succession as a matter of right.

According to Wipo of Burgundy, the Italian kingship was not compatible with the German thron. Italy was a separate nation from Germany with its own identity. The emissaries justified the actions of their fellow citizens by claiming that Pavia had always been loyal to the Italian king, as long as the king was alive and present, and that the revolt had taken place when the Italian throne was vacant. Conrad rejected the argument, that just as a ship remains devoted to its captain after his death, the Empire remains imperial property after the death of an emperor. The kingdom of Italy, according to Conrad, belonged to the empire as a matter of legal right. In his ''[[Constitutio de feudis]]'' (\"Edict on the Benefices of the Italian Kingdom\") of 1038 he would determine his regulations of the feudal contracts in Italy.<ref name=\"Stock1983\">{{cite book|author=Brian Stock|title=The Implications of Literacy: Written Language and Models of Interpretation in the Eleventh and Twelfth Centuries p. 156|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6Ves8Li9LH8C|year=1983|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=0-691-10227-9}}</ref> Conrad also declared that the Ostrogothic palace was property of the Empire and therefore the king had the right to punish those responsible for its destruction. The Pavian embassy returned to Italy in opposition to [[Salian dynasty|Salian]] rule.<ref name=boni/>\n\nIn February 1026, Conrad assembled a large army of armored knights for an expedition into Italy, including troops commanded by both [[Aribo (archbishop of Mainz)|Archbishop Aribo of Mainz]] and [[Pilgrim (archbishop of Cologne)|Archbishop Pilgrim of Cologne]]. Conrad's army moved south and a contingent besieged Pavia and blocked all trade in the area, as he continued his campaign. By March 1026, Conrad arrived in [[Milan]] and was crowned with the [[Iron Crown of the Lombards]] by [[Aribert (archbishop of Milan)|Archbishop Aribert of Milan]] as [[King of the Lombards]]. From Milan, Conrad traveled to [[Vercelli]], where he celebrated [[Easter]] with the aged [[Leo of Vercelli|Bishop Leo of Vercelli]], who had been a chief advisor to the late [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Otto III]]. When Leo died a few days later, Archbishop Aribert became the chief supporter of the [[Salian dynasty]] in Italy. With Conrad's assistance, Aribert rose to highest ranking religious office in Italy and oversaw the expansion of the [[Basilica of Sant'Ambrogio]] in Milan. In June 1026, Conrad lead his army to [[Ravenna]], but quartering his soldiers among the Ravennese population caused tensions in the city. Conrad then marched north to mitigate the risk the summer heat might pose to his army. In autumn Conrad left his summer camp in the [[Po valley]] and marched to the Burgundian border. Conrad then celebrated [[Christmas]] at [[Ivrea]]. By the end of winter, the Italian aristocrats voluntarily ended their opposition to Conrad's reign. Pavia, however, remained in revolt until early 1027 when [[Odilo of Cluny|Abbot Odilo of Cluny]] brokered a peace deal between the city and Conrad.<ref name=\"Halfond2016\">{{cite book|author=Gregory I.

During the festivities a power struggle between the archbishops of Milan and Ravenna ensued and was settled in favor of Milan.

On April 6, 1027, at a [[synod]] held in the [[Lateran Basilica]] with [[Pope John XIX]], the emperor addressed the matter acknowledging the [[Patriarchate of Aquileia]] superior to the [[Patriarchate of Grado]], an ally of the [[Byzantine Empire]]. The Aquileian [[Poppo of Treffen|Poppo]] had been a loyal supporter of Emperor Henry II, who appointed him patriarch in 1020. Conrad's action placed the patriarchate at Grado under Poppo's authority, securing Poppo's loyalty by making him the Emperor's top official in northern Italy. The synod ended the independence of the Grado church and limited the political autonomy of Venice. In so doing, Conrad broke with the policies of his predecessors and revoked Venice's privileged trading status.<ref name=\"Schutz2010\"/>\n\nIn May 1027 Conrad returned to Germany in order to attend the funeral of [[Henry V, Duke of Bavaria|Duke Henry V of Bavaria]] at [[Regensburg]]. Conrad asserted his right to appoint the new [[Duchy of Bavaria|Duke of Bavaria]]. He made the unprecedented decision of chosing his 10-year-old son [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry]], ignoring several suitable candidates who held valid claims to the fief.\n\nThe young prince assumed Bavarian rule on 24 June 1027. Following Henry's appointment, Conrad held court at Regensburg and issued a decree, that all imperial property in the duchy must be documented. This required the various counts and bishops to list and report all imperial property in their domains, castles and abbeys. Even the [[Dowager Empress]] [[Cunigunde of Luxembourg]] was required to report to Conrad, who even claimed that Cunegonde's ''[[wittum]]'' (money and property she had inherited from her deceased husband Emperor Henry II) belonged to him. These dubious claims to property and the excessive promotion of imperial authority over the ducal and clerical affairs throughout Bavaria caused, unsurprisingly, new tension between him and the German aristocracy.{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=114}}<ref name=brit/>\n\n===Uprising in Swabia===\n[[File:MPano 07.jpg|thumb|200px|left|The [[Konstanz Minster]], seat of the [[Bishop of Constance]]]]\n[[File:Oberfalkenstein.jpg|thumb|200px|left|ruins of the ''Upper Falkenstein Castle'', 2008]]\nIn 1025, [[Ernest II, Duke of Swabia|Duke Ernest II of Swabia]], Conrad's stepson from his marriage to [[Gisela of Swabia]], rebelled against his stepfather when he was elected king of Germany. By 1026, Conrad had defeated the resistance and Ernest submitted to his reign. Due to the intervention of his mother Gisela, Ernest was allowed to accompany Conrad on his expedition to Italy in 1026. During the expedition, the rebellion led by [[Conrad II, Duke of Carinthia|Conrad of Carinthia]] and [[Welf II, Count of Swabia|Count Welf II of Swabia]] continued. Conrad had named [[Bruno of Augsburg|Bishop Bruno of Augsburg]] regent of Germany while he marched south to Italy.  When Bruno was defeated by the rebels, Conrad sent Ernest back to Germany in September 1026 to end the revolt. When Ernest returned, he joined the opposition and rebelled against Conrad again.\n\nIn 1027 Conrad returned to Germany after his imperial coronation and held court at [[Augsburg]], calling upon the rebels to surrender. Ernest, trusting in the number and fidelity of his vassals, rejected the peace offer and appealed to his Swabian counts to join him in the rebellion. According to [[Wipo of Burgundy]], the counts refused, stating that while they had sworn loyalty to Ernest, they would not rebel against their Emperor. Without the support of the Swabian counts, Ernest, Conrad of Carinthia and Count Welf surrendered to Conrad at [[Worms, Germany|Worms]] on September 9, 1027, ending the rebellion. Conrad stripped Ernest of his ducal title and imprisoned him at [[Giebichenstein Castle]] in [[Duchy of Saxony|Saxony]]. Gisela supported Conrad against her son, but did not want Ernest to be entirely humiliated. As a result of his mother's intervention, Conrad allowed Ernest to retain his title while imprisoned, with Gisela serving as regent over the duchy.<ref name=\"Schutz2010\"/>\n\nIn 1028, after Conrad's son [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry]] was crowned in Aachen as King of Germany, Gisela again intervened on Ernest's behalf. Conrad pardoned Ernest and released him from prison in 1028, but Gisela retained regency over Swabia. Ernest served as duke in name only. On Easter 1030, Conrad offered to restore Ernest his full powers as Duke of Swabia if he would crack down on the Emperor's enemies there. Ernest's refusal, especially against his friend Count Werner of Kyburg, resulted in his final downfall. Conrad stripped his stepson of his title, declared him a public enemy, and had him [[excommunicated]]. Even his mother Gisela did not come to his rescue. Within a few months, both Ernest and Werner, who had retreated to ''Falkenstein Castle'', south of modern [[Schramberg]] in the [[Black Forest]] were killed in a battle against a contingent of the [[Bishop of Constance]]. The fall of Ernest greatly weakened the sovereignty of Swabia. Conrad appointed Ernest's younger brother [[Herman IV, Duke of Swabia|Herman]] as new Swabian prince. As Herman was still an infant, the Bishop of Constance was assigned his regent. Eight years later in 1038, Herman died and Conrad installed his own son Henry as duke, securing imperial control over the duchy.<ref name=\"Schutz2010\"/>\n\n===Conflict with Adalbero===\nConrad had to enforce his [[royal prerogative]]s in the [[Duchy of Carinthia]] and the [[Duchy of Swabia]]. [[Adalbero, Duke of Carinthia|Duke Adalbero of Carinthia]] had been appointed as duke in 1012 under Emperor Henry II and remained loyal to imperial authority, supporting Conrad's election as German king in 1024. At a [[synod]] in [[Frankfurt]] in September 1027, Conrad attempted to resolve the decades' long ''Gandersheim Conflict''. Adalbero accompanied the Emperor and acted as his sword-bearer during the proceeding, indicating Conrad's trust in him. From 1028 on, Adalbero governed his Duchy as an independent state.\n\nIn particular, he attempted to conduct peaceful relations with the [[Stephen I of Hungary|King Stephen I]] of the [[Kingdom of Hungary (1000\u20131301)|Kingdom of Hungary]]. Under Emperor Henry II, who was the brother-in-law to Stephen, relations between the Empire and Hungary had been friendly. Upon Henry's death in 1024, Conrad adopted a more aggressive policy, prompting border raids into the Empire from Hungary. The raids particularly affected Adalbero's domain of Carinthia, which shared a long, eastern border with Hungary.{{sfn|Gy\u00f6rffy|1994|p= 140}}{{sfn|Makk|2001|p=45}}\n\nConrad summoned Adalbero to court at [[Bamberg]] on 18 May 1035, to answer an indictment of [[treason]] for his actions regarding Hungary. In the presence of the German dukes, Conrad demanded that Adalbero be stripped of all his titles and lands. The dukes hesitated and demanded that Conrad's son [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry]], the Germany's co-King and Conrad's designated successor, join the assembly before a decision was made. Henry refused to depose Adalbero, citing an earlier agreement with Adelbero to be his ally in negotiating a settlement between him and his father. Conrad resorted to exhortations, pleas, and threats to convince Henry to support Adalbero's deposition. Henry's support was soon followed by that of the other dukes. Conrad then ordered Adalbero to be removed as Duke and sentenced him and his son to [[exile]]. After attacking Conrad's allies in Carinthia, Adalbero fled to his mother's estates in [[Ebersberg]] in the [[Duchy of Bavaria]], where he remained until his death in 1039. The duchy of Carinthia remained unoccupied until February 2, 1035, when Conrad named his cousin [[Conrad II, Duke of Carinthia|Conrad the Younger]] as the new duke. With the appointment, the three southern German duchies of Swabia, Bavaria, and Carinthia were all under the control of Emperor Conrad through his family members (his stepson Herman in Swabia, his son Henry in Bavaria, and his cousin Conrad in Carinthia).{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=84}}\n\nControl of the southern duchies allowed Conrad to continue the process begun under the [[Ottonian dynasty]], centralizing the Emperors authority over the Empire at the expense of the regional dukes. Conrad broke with Ottonian tradition, however, in favoring a more strict means of controlling rebellious vassals. Whereas the Ottonians followed a policy of informal public submission and subsequent reconciliation, Conrad used treason trials to declare rebels as \"public enemies\" to legitimize his subsequent harsh treatment, as he had done with [[Ernest II, Duke of Swabia|Ernest II of Swabia]] and Adalbero. The nobles saw use of these treason trials not as mere power shifts in favor of the Emperor, but as a cruel breach of German tradition.{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=88}}\n\n===Policy towards the Church===\n[[File:Bischof Poppo von Trier.png|thumb|[[Prince-bishop]] [[Poppo (archbishop of Trier)|Poppo von Babenberg]] was [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Trier|archbishop of Trier]] and imperial prince of the [[Electorate of Trier]]]]\nConrad continued the [[Ottonian dynasty]]'s [[Imperial Church System]] - a policy of using the German Church as a vehicle for imperial control. Beginning in the 950s, the Ottonians had favored Church officials over secular nobles for appointment to the Empire's most important offices. Claiming \"[[divine right of king|divine right]]\" to rule the Empire, the Ottonians increasingly viewed themselves as [[defender of the faith|protectors of the Church]] and thus demanded loyalty from the Church officials.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-ecclesiastical-history/article/imperial-church-system-of-the-ottonian-and-salian-rulers-a-reconsideration/8B8887F785FC72BFD48A4A5DDF8A49C2 |title= The \u2018Imperial Church System\u2019 of the Ottonian and Salian Rulers: a Reconsideration|publisher= Cambridge Org | date=March 25, 2011   | author=Timothy Reuter   | accessdate= January 27, 2020 }}</ref> In return, the various bishoprics and abbeys of the Empire were granted extensive landholdings and secular authority, providing immunity from the jurisdiction of the secular nobles.

Under royal service, the bishops and abbots were required to provide hospitality and accommodations to the Emperor and his court when he arrived. It also required the Church officials to act as quasi-bureaucracy for the Empire. Under military service, the Church was required to supply soldiers for the Emperors' army or to act as diplomats at his direction. Conrad energetically continued this tradition.<ref name=\"Schutz2010\"/><ref name=\"Bernhardt2002\">{{cite book|author=John W.

Conrad and the other members of the [[Salian dynasty]] had little interest in the founding of new monasteries. Through their hundred-year dynasty, the Salians only founded one: [[Limburg Abbey]] which was converted from a fortress to a monastery in 1025.  The Ottonians established at least eight in their hundred-year reign. Additionally, the Ottonians were active in the establishment of Church affairs, but Conrad was uninterested, only calling five [[synods]] during his reign and usually only to restore peace. Conrad's decisions on Church policy were often left to his wife [[Gisela of Swabia]]. When [[Aribo, Archbishop of Mainz|Archbishop Aribo of Mainz]], [[Primate of Germany]], died in 1031, Conrad considered both [[Bardo (bishop)|Abbot Bardo]] of [[Hersfeld Abbey]] and the renowned [[theologian]] [[Wazo of Li\u00e8ge]], then serving as the dean of the [[cathedral chapter]] for the [[Prince-Bishopric of Li\u00e8ge|Bishop of Liege]].

In January 1018, Henry II and Boles\u0142aw I signed a peace treaty, known as the [[Peace of Bautzen]],<ref name=Knefelkamp123>Knefelkamp (2002), p. 125</ref> in which the Empire and Poland declared a permanent peace with Boles\u0142aw recognizing Henry II as his nominal feudal lord.<ref name=cmh>Previte-orton, pg. 451</ref> In return, Henry II granted to Boles\u0142aw lands on the Empire's eastern border. To seal the peace, Boles\u0142aw I, a widower, reinforced his dynastic bonds with the German nobility by marrying [[Oda of Meissen]], daughter of the Saxon Margrave Eckard I of Meissen. Empire and Poland remained at peace for the remainder of Henry's reign. Henry's death in 1024 gave Boles\u0142aw an opportunity to increase his own power. Boles\u0142aw took advantage of the interregnum in Germany and crowned himself king on [[Easter]], April 25, 1025. Boles\u0142aw was thus the first Polish king as his predecessors had been considered mere \"dukes\" by both the Empire and the Pope in Rome. Boles\u0142aw died within two months of the coronation, most likely due to an illness. Boles\u0142aw's son, [[Mieszko II Lambert]], succeeded him as King, being crowned on Christmas Day 1025. Upon assuming the Polish throne, Mieszko expelled his older half-brother [[Bezprym]] and his younger brother [[Otto Boles\u0142awowic]]. Otto went to Germany to seek Conrad's protection.{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=209}}\n\nConrad considered the assumption of the title \"king\" by Mieszko an act of war and a disregard of his imperial authority, but had to address domestic issues before marching against Mieszko. In 1026 Conrad II marched into Italy to assert German authority south of the Alps and to claim the imperial crown from the Pope. In his absence, [[Ernest II, Duke of Swabia|Duke Ernest II of Swabia]], [[Conrad II, Duke of Carinthia|Conrad the Younger]], and [[Frederick II, Duke of Upper Lorraine|Duke Frederick II of Upper Lorraine]] rebelled against his authority.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://archive.is/20130701012634/http://bsbndb.bsb.lrz-muenchen.de/sfz58985.html |title= Mathilde von Schwaben  |publisher=  Neue deutsche Biographie | date=  | author=Eckhard Freise    | accessdate= April 1, 2020 }}</ref>\n\nThe rebels sought the support of Mieszko, which the Polish king granted and promised to take military action against Conrad. Conrad returned to Germany in mid-1027, putting an end to the rebellion before Mieszko could marshal his forces. In preparations for his own invasion of Poland, Conrad developed a closer relationship with [[Cnut the Great|Cnut, King of England and Denmark]] (whose kingdom lay along the Empire's northern border). Cnut accompanied Conrad to his coronation as emperor in 1027, and Conrad granted authority over the [[Duchy of Schleswig|March of Schleswig]], the land-bridge between Denmark and Germany.{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=215}}\n\nFearing a joint German-Danish attack, Mieszko invaded the Empire's [[March of Lusatia]] and the territory of the [[Lutici|Lutician Federation]] in 1028.<ref name=Herrmann363>Herrmann (1985), p. 363</ref> The Lutici were a federation of [[West Slavs|West Slavic]] [[Polabian Slavs|Polabian]] tribes that developed in the 10th century. Located on the northeast border of Germany, the Lutici were the regular target of German aggression during the early years of the [[Ottonian dynasty]] with [[Emperor Otto I]]'s lieutenants [[Herman Billung]] and [[Gero]], subjugating many of the Slavic tribes beginning in the 940s. In 983, as part of the [[Great Slav Rising]], the Lutici initiated an open rebellion.  In the ensuing war (983-995), the Lutici succeeded in reclaiming their independence and gained control of the [[Billung March]] and [[Northern March]] from the Empire.<ref name=Luebke99>L\u00fcbke (2002), p. 99</ref> Though [[Emperor Otto III]] allied with [[Boles\u0142aw I Chrobry|Duke Boles\u0142aw I of Poland]] to reintegrate them into the Empire, Otto III's death ended the friendly relationship between Poland the Empire. Instead, Boles\u0142aw competed with Otto III's successor, Emperor Henry II, for dominion over the Lutici, causing Henry II to ally the Empire with the Lutici against Poland. Under the [[Peace of Bautzen]] in 1018, all three parties remained in uneasy peace, with Poland allowed to hold the Empire's [[Margraviate of Meissen]]. Of the eastern marches, the Empire only retained the [[March of Lusatia]]. Mieszko's 1028 invasion ended the peace. The Lutici sent ambassadors to seek Conrad's protection against Mieszko, which Conrad granted and renewed the German-Lutician alliance.<ref name=Herrmann363/>\n\nSeeking to protect the Lutici from Polish invasion, Conrad launched a counter-invasion in 1029 and placed the Polish-held [[Bautzen]] under siege. Faced with a potential invasion by Hungary and the failure of the Lutici to provide their promised contingent of troops, Conrad retreated. In 1030, Poland secured an alliance with Hungary, with Stephen I invading Bavaria while Mieszko invaded Saxony. Conrad responded by allying with [[Yaroslav the Wise]], [[Grand Prince of Kiev]], to attack and capture [[Red Ruthenia]] on Poland's eastern border. In 1031, Conrad concluded a peace treaty with Hungary by ceding territory in eastern [[Duchy of Carinthia|Carinithia]] to Hungarian control. Freed from the threat of Hungarian attack, the Emperor was able to focus his attention on attacking Poland. Marching on Mieszko in autumn 1031, Conrad laid siege at the Polish held-[[Bautzen]] in the [[Margraviate of Meissen]]. Mieszko's authority was shaken by the German and Kieven invasions, and the rebellion led by his exiled brother [[Bezprym]]. Mieszko surrendered to Conrad in fall 1031. Under the [[Treaty of Merseburg]], Mieszko returned control over the [[Margraviate of Meissen]] and the [[March of Lusatia]] to the Empire.<ref name=\"Boshof 2008, p. 71\">Boshof (2008), p. 71</ref>\n\n====Treaty of Merseburg====\n[[File:Wojciech Gerson-Krolowa Ryksa.jpg|thumb|left|19th century painting of king [[Mieszko II Lambert|Mieszko II's]] wife [[Richeza of Lotharingia|Queen Richeza]] (Wojciech Gerson, 1891) ]]\nSoon after Mieszko concluded peace with the Empire, he was deposed by his half-brother [[Bezprym]]. When Mieszko assumed the Polish throne in 1025 he exiled his brother, who fled to the protection of [[Kievan Rus]] to the east of Poland. With Meiszko's position weakened by his wars with the Empire, Bezprym, supported by Conrad, persuaded the Kevian Grand Price [[Yaroslav I the Wise]] to invade Poland and install Bezprym as the country's ruler. The Kievan invasion was a success. Mieszko fled to the [[Duchy of Bohemia]] where he was imprisoned and [[castrated]] by [[Old\u0159ich, Duke of Bohemia|Duke Oldrich]] in retribution for Mieszko's father [[Boles\u0142aw I of Poland|Boles\u0142aw]]'s blinding [[Boleslaus III, Duke of Bohemia|Duke Boleslaus III]], Oldrich's brother, thirty years earlier. Shortly after taking power, Bezprym sent the [[Polish Crown Jewels|Polish royal crown and regalia]] to Conrad, officially renouncing the title \"king\" in favor of the traditional title \"duke\" and accepting the overlordship of the Empire over Poland.<ref>Boshof (2008), p. 71</ref> The Royal crown and regalia were delivered by Mieszko II's wife, [[Richeza of Lotharingia|Queen Richeza]].<ref name=\"Halfond2016\"/>\n\nBezprym's reign was short. Bezprym's extreme cruelty caused his half-brother [[Otto Boles\u0142awowic]] to lead a conspiracy. Bezprym's own men murdered him in spring 1032, created a [[power vacuum]] in Poland. Conrad responded by holding an [[hoftag|assembly]] at [[Merseburg]] in 1033 to address the situation. Conrad's wife, the Empress [[Gisela of Swabia]], interceded on Mieszko's behalf and requested he be freed from imprisonment in Bohemia and allowed to regain the Polish throne. Under the terms of the [[Treaty of Merseburg]], Conrad divided Poland between Mieszko, Otto, and another half brother Detric. Mieszko was allowed to retain the title Duke and nominal authority over all of Poland. With a strong central leader to guide it, the treaty significantly increased the Empire's influence over Poland.<ref name=\"Knefelkamp 2002, p. 137\">Knefelkamp (2002), p. 137</ref><ref name=\"Boshof 2008, p. 72\">Boshof (2008), p. 72</ref>\n\nThe division was short-lived: in 1033 Otto was killed by one of his own men, and Mieszko II took his domains. Shortly after, Mieszko expelled Detric, reuniting the whole country in his hands. Though Mieszko regained his former power, he still had to fight against the nobility and his own subjects. Mieszko did not accept Bezprym's renunciation of the Polish crown and continued to style himself as \"King\" instead of \"Duke\". Mieszko II died soon after in 1034, and upon his death, a [[Pagan reaction in Poland]] erupted. Subsequently, his wife [[Richeza of Lotharingia|Richeza]] and son [[Casimir I of Poland|Casimir I]] fled to Germany.<ref name=\"Knefelkamp 2002, p. 137\"/><ref name=\"Boshof 2008, p. 72\"/>\n\n===Relations with Eastern Europe===\n\n====Bohemia====\nThe [[Duchy of Bohemia]] was incorporated into the Holy Roman Empire in 1004 during the [[German-Polish War (1002\u20131018)|German-Polish Wars]], which stretched from 1002 to 1018. [[Emperor Henry II]] installed [[Jarom\u00edr, Duke of Bohemia|Jaromir]] as [[Duke of Bohemia]] and promised protection against Polish aggression in return for incorporation. Jaromir ruled only a smaller territory, however, as Poland occupied the traditional Czech territories of [[Moravia]], [[Silesia]], [[Lesser Poland]] and [[Lusatia]]. In 1012, Jaromir was deposed by his brother [[Old\u0159ich, Duke of Bohemia|Oldrich]], who assumed the Bohemian throne for himself. Following the resumption of hostilities between the Empire and Poland in 1028, Oldrich went on the offensive against Poland, reconquering Moravia by 1029, which helped to stabilize his duchy. The war ended in 1031 when Polish King [[Mieszko II of Poland|Mieszko II]] surrendered to Conrad. In the civil war which followed, Meiszko was forced to flee Poland for Bohemia, where Oldrich had him imprisoned and castrated in revenge for the torture Meiszko's father, [[Boles\u0142aw I of Poland]], inflicted upon [[Boleslaus III, Duke of Bohemia|Duke Boleslaus III]], Oldrich's brother, thirty years before.<ref name=\"Prague09\">{{cite book|author1=Cosmas (of Prague)|author2=Cosmas of Prague|author3=C\u00f4me de Prague|title=The Chronicle of the Czechs|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZG7igBN41oUC&pg=PA105|year=2009|publisher=CUA Press|isbn=978-0-8132-1570-9|pages=105\u2013}}</ref>\n\nPoland was unable to stabilize in the wake of Mieszko's exile, forcing Conrad to convene an assembly in July 1033 to issue the [[Treaty of Merseburg]] which restored Meiszko to the Polish throne. Conrad summoned Oldrich to appear to the assembly, but Oldrich refused. His absence raised the ire of the Emperor and Conrad, busy with securing his succession to the Burgundy throne, charged his son [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Duke Henry of Bavaria]] with punishing the recalcitrant Bohemian. At age 17, Henry's march on Bohemia was his first independent military command. The expedition was complete success, with Henry deposing Oldrich and restoring his brother Jaromir to the Bohemian throne, with Oldrich's son [[Bretislaus I, Duke of Bohemia|Bretislaus I]] appointed as Count of [[Moravia]].

While the reason for the conflict between father and son has been lost, it is believed Bretislaus supported Jaromir over his father.

[[Odo II, Count of Blois|Count Odo II of Blois]], who had strong family ties with Rudolph, also emphasized his right in the succession.

Conrad thus left the ''[[Mezzogiorno]]'' firmly in Guaimar's hands and loyal, for once, to the Holy Roman Empire.<ref name=boni/>\n\n===Death===\n[[Image:Grab Konrad II. im Dom zu Speyer.JPG|thumb|150px|Conrad II's tomb in the [[Speyer Cathedral]]]]\nDuring the return to Germany a severe epidemic decimated the ranks of the troops.

It is an adaptation of the 1961 novel [[Thunderball (novel)|of the same name]] by [[Ian Fleming]], which in turn was based on an original story by [[Kevin McClory]], [[Jack Whittingham]], and Fleming. It was the third and final Bond film to be directed by [[Terence Young (director)|Terence Young]], with its screenplay by [[Richard Maibaum]] and [[John Hopkins (writer)|John Hopkins]].

The search leads Bond to the [[Bahamas]], where he encounters [[Emilio Largo]], the card-playing, eye patch-wearing SPECTRE Number Two. Backed by [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] agent [[Felix Leiter]] and Largo's mistress, [[Domino Vitali|Domino Derval]], Bond's search culminates in an underwater battle with Largo's henchmen.

In 1983, [[Warner Bros.]] released a second film adaptation of the novel under the title ''[[Never Say Never Again]]'', with McClory as executive producer.\n\n==Plot==\nJames Bond attends the funeral of Colonel Jacques Bouvar, a [[SPECTRE]] operative connected with the previous murders of two MI6 agents.<ref name = \"Bouvar\">The name is often misspelled: it is spelled '''Bouvar''' on Thunderball Ultimate Edition DVD Region 2. See Disc One, English subtitles for the film, and Disc Two under \"007 Mission Control / Villains / Jacques Bouvar\"</ref> Bouvar is alive and disguised as his own widow, but Bond identifies him. Pursuing Bouvar to his ch\u00e2teau, Bond fights and kills him, escaping with use of a [[jetpack]] and his [[Aston Martin DB5]].\n\nAt a SPECTRE meeting in Paris, chaired by the enigmatic [[Ernst Stavro Blofeld|Number One]], [[Emilio Largo]] (SPECTRE operative Number Two) introduces the group's latest project: hijacking two [[Nuclear weapons|atomic bomb]]s and holding [[NATO]] for ransom. The plot begins at Shrublands sanatorium, located close to a NATO air base. Coincidentally, James Bond is at Shrublands to improve his health. There, he notices that fellow patient Count Lippe has a [[Tong (organization)|Tong]] tattoo. Bond searches Lippe's room, and is seen leaving by the man in the adjoining room, whose head is covered in bandages. Lippe tries to murder Bond with a [[traction (orthopedics)|spinal traction]] machine, but Bond is saved by his physiotherapist, Patricia Fearing.\n\nLippe and Angelo Palazzi, the bandaged man, are part of SPECTRE's plot. Angelo's face has been [[plastic surgery|surgically altered]] to match [[French Air Force]] pilot Fran\u00e7ois Derval, who is also staying at Shrublands. Derval is slated to fly on a training mission aboard an [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] [[Avro Vulcan]] strategic jet bomber loaded with two atomic bombs. Angelo kills Derval, collects $100,000 from SPECTRE Agent Fiona Volpe, then demands an extra $150,000 for the job. Fiona seemingly acquiesces. The next morning, Angelo takes Derval's place on the flight. Angelo gasses the rest of the crew, then flies the Vulcan to the [[Bahamas]], landing it in shallow water near Largo's ship, the ''[[Disco Volante (ship)|Disco Volante]]''. SPECTRE [[Scuba diving|scuba divers]], commanded by Largo, retrieve the atomic bombs. Angelo, trapped by his seat strapping, is left to drown by Largo for reneging on his original deal with SPECTRE.\n\nMeanwhile, Bond has uncovered Derval's corpse at the clinic. On the way to London, Lippe attacks Bond, but a masked motorcyclist kills Lippe with a rocket-propelled grenade and zooms off. Abandoning the motorcycle and unmasking, the rider is revealed to be Fiona, acting on Blofeld's orders to eliminate Lippe for hiring the greedy Angelo.\n\nAt an MI6 conference in London, all of the 00 agents are informed that SPECTRE demands \u00a3100 million from NATO in exchange for returning the bombs, and threatens to destroy a major city in the [[United States]] or the [[United Kingdom]] if the ransom is not paid within seven days. Bond recognises the briefing photograph of Derval as the corpse at Shrublands. He asks M to send him to [[Nassau, Bahamas]], to contact Derval's sister, [[Domino Vitali|Domino]].\n\nWhile snorkeling, Bond meets Domino. Later, at a casino, he encounters Largo and Domino, who is his mistress. Bond enters a game against Largo and wins, and subsequently takes Domino to a dance. Bond and Largo recognise each other as adversaries and begin a tense cat-and-mouse game while still pretending ignorance of each other's true nature. Bond meets [[Felix Leiter]] and [[Q (James Bond)|Q]], and is issued various gadgets, including an underwater infrared camera, a distress beacon, underwater breathing apparatus, a flare gun, and a [[Geiger counter]]. Diving under the ''Disco Volante'', Bond fails to find the atomic bombs, but detects an underwater hatch; Bond narrowly escapes Largo's henchmen. The next day, Bond visits Largo at his estate, Palmyra. Bond's partner, Paula Caplan, is taken to Palmyra and then commits suicide with a cyanide pill rather than give any information.\n\nBond is kidnapped by Volpe, but escapes through a [[Junkanoo]] celebration to the Kiss Kiss club, where Volpe is accidentally shot and killed by her own bodyguard. Bond and Felix search for the Vulcan, finding it underwater and inside a camouflaged cargo net. Bond tells Domino that Largo killed her brother and asks her for help in finding the bombs, giving her the Geiger counter. As she searches for the bombs on the ship, she is caught and tortured by Largo.\n\nMeanwhile, Bond disguises himself as one of Largo's henchmen, and uncovers Largo's plan to destroy [[Miami Beach]]. Bond is discovered and trapped by Largo, but rescued by Leiter in a [[United States Coast Guard]] helicopter, allowing him to alert the authorities of Largo's plan. [[U.S. Navy]] [[frogmen]] parachute into the area from a [[US Air Force]] transport aircraft, with Bond joining them, and after an underwater battle, Largo's divers surrender. Largo escapes to the ''Disco Volante'', which has one of the bombs on board. As it begins to leave, Bond gets on an underwater fin, and [[Royal Navy]] and U.S. Coast Guard vessels pursue the ''Disco Volante''. Largo has the ship start creating a smoke cloud, and when the Royal Navy and U.S. vessels start to close in, he has the rear of the ship jettisoned, revealing the front to be a [[hydrofoil]], which escapes at high speed. Bond climbs into the ship's bridge, where he battles Largo and two crewmen while controlling the ship as it weaves erratically among rocks and reefs. Meanwhile, Largo's hired nuclear physicist Kutze frees Domino. Largo is just about to shoot Bond when Domino shoots and kills Largo with a harpoon gun. Bond, Domino, and Kutze jump overboard before the ship runs aground and explodes. A [[Fulton surface-to-air recovery system|sky hook]]-equipped CIA [[B-17]] aircraft then rescues Bond and Domino.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Sean Connery]] as [[James Bond filmography|James Bond]]: An MI6 agent assigned to retrieve two stolen nuclear weapons\n<!-- title cards -->\n* [[Claudine Auger]] as Domino (voice dubbed by [[Nikki van der Zyl]]):<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nikkivanderzyl.co.uk/bond/|title=Film Industry Tricks OR How to fool most of the people most of the time!|publisher=Official Nikki van der Zyl website|author=George A.

Nevertheless, director Young cast her once again in his next film, ''[[Triple Cross (1966 film)|Triple Cross]]'' (1966).

Filming then moved to the [[Ch\u00e2teau d'Anet]], near [[Dreux]], France, for the fight in precredit sequence. Much of the film was shot in the Bahamas; ''Thunderball'' is widely known for its extensive underwater action scenes which are played out through much of the latter half of the film. The rest of the film was shot at [[Pinewood Studios]], Buckinghamshire, [[Silverstone Circuit|Silverstone racing circuit]] for the chase involving Count Lippe, Fiona Volpe's RPG-armed BSA Lightning motorcycle and James Bond's Aston Martin DB5 before moving to [[Nassau, Bahamas|Nassau]], and [[Paradise Island]] in the Bahamas (where most of the footage was shot), and Miami.<ref name=\"ttp\">{{cite AV media |year= 1995 |title = The Thunderball Phenomenon |medium = DVD |publisher = MGM/UA Home Entertainment |location = Thunderball Ultimate Edition DVD, Region 2, Disc 2}}</ref> [[Huntington Hartford]] gave permission to shoot footage on his Paradise Island and is thanked at the end of the film.\n\n[[File:ROCK POINT, NASSAU, BAHAMAS.jpg|thumb|The home used as Largo's estate in the film]]\nOn arriving in Nassau, McClory searched for locations to shoot many of the key sequences of the film and used the home of a local millionaire couple, the Sullivans, for Largo's estate, Palmyra.<ref>{{cite AV media|title=007 Mission Control: Exotic Locations|publisher = MGM/UA Home Entertainment|location = Thunderball Ultimate Edition DVD, Region 2,Disc 2 |year=2006|medium = DVD}}</ref> Part of the SPECTRE underwater assault was also shot on the coastal grounds of another millionaire's home on the island. The most difficult sequences to film were the underwater action scenes; the first to be shot underwater was at a depth of 50 feet to shoot the scene where SPECTRE divers remove the atomic bombs from the sunken Vulcan bomber. [[Peter Lamont]] had previously visited a Royal Air Force bomber station carrying a concealed camera which he used to get close-up shots of secret missiles (those appearing in the film were not actually present).<ref name=\"making of\" /> Most of the underwater scenes had to be done at lower tides due to the sharks on the Bahamian coast.<ref>{{cite AV media  |title = Commentary 1: Thunderball Ultimate Edition, Region 2 }}</ref>\n\nAfter he read the script, Connery realised the risk of the sequence with the sharks in Largo's pool and insisted that production designer [[Ken Adam]] build a [[Plexiglas]] partition inside the pool. The barrier was not a fixed structure, so when one of the sharks managed to pass through it, Connery fled the pool, seconds away from attack.<ref name=\"ttp\"/> Ken Adam later told UK daily newspaper ''[[The Guardian]]'',\n\n<blockquote>We had to use special effects, but unlike special effects today, they were real. The jet pack we used in ''Thunderball'' was real - it was invented for the United States Army. Bloody dangerous, and it only lasted a couple of minutes. The ejector seat in the Aston Martin was real and Emilio Largo's boat, the ''Disco Volante'', was real. You had power boats at that time, but there were no good-sized yachts that were able to travel at 40 to 50 knots, so it was quite a problem. But by combining a hydrofoil, which we bought in Puerto Rico for $10,000, and a catamaran, it at least looked like a big yacht. We combined the two hulls with a one-inch slip bolt and when they split it worked like a dream. We used lots of sharks for this movie. I'd rented a villa in the Bahamas with a saltwater pool which we filled with sharks and used for underwater filming. The smell was horrendous. This was where Sean Connery came close to being bitten. We had a plexiglass corridor to protect him, but I didn't have quite enough plexiglass and one of the sharks got through.

[[Voit]] provided much of the underwater gear in exchange for [[product placement]] and film [[tie-in]] merchandise. Lamar Boren, an underwater photographer, was hired to shoot all of the sequences. [[United States Air Force]] Lieutenant Colonel [[Charles Russhon]], who had already established Eon productions' rapports with the local authorities in Turkey for ''From Russia with Love'' (1963) and at [[Fort Knox]] for ''Goldfinger'' (1964), supplied the experimental rocket fuel used to destroy the ''Disco Volante''.

In 1983, [[Warner Bros.]] released a second film adaptation of the novel under the title ''[[Never Say Never Again]]'', with McClory as executive producer.\n\n==Plot==\nJames Bond attends the funeral of Colonel Jacques Bouvar, a [[SPECTRE]] operative connected with the previous murders of two MI6 agents.<ref name = \"Bouvar\">The name is often misspelled: it is spelled '''Bouvar''' on Thunderball Ultimate Edition DVD Region 2. See Disc One, English subtitles for the film, and Disc Two under \"007 Mission Control / Villains / Jacques Bouvar\"</ref> Bouvar is alive and disguised as his own widow, but Bond identifies him. Pursuing Bouvar to his ch\u00e2teau, Bond fights and kills him, escaping with use of a [[jetpack]] and his [[Aston Martin DB5]].\n\nAt a SPECTRE meeting in Paris, chaired by the enigmatic [[Ernst Stavro Blofeld|Number One]], [[Emilio Largo]] (SPECTRE operative Number Two) introduces the group's latest project: hijacking two [[Nuclear weapons|atomic bomb]]s and holding [[NATO]] for ransom. The plot begins at Shrublands sanatorium, located close to a NATO air base. Coincidentally, James Bond is at Shrublands to improve his health. There, he notices that fellow patient Count Lippe has a [[Tong (organization)|Tong]] tattoo. Bond searches Lippe's room, and is seen leaving by the man in the adjoining room, whose head is covered in bandages. Lippe tries to murder Bond with a [[traction (orthopedics)|spinal traction]] machine, but Bond is saved by his physiotherapist, Patricia Fearing.\n\nLippe and Angelo Palazzi, the bandaged man, are part of SPECTRE's plot. Angelo's face has been [[plastic surgery|surgically altered]] to match [[French Air Force]] pilot Fran\u00e7ois Derval, who is also staying at Shrublands. Derval is slated to fly on a training mission aboard an [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] [[Avro Vulcan]] strategic jet bomber loaded with two atomic bombs. Angelo kills Derval, collects $100,000 from SPECTRE Agent Fiona Volpe, then demands an extra $150,000 for the job. Fiona seemingly acquiesces. The next morning, Angelo takes Derval's place on the flight. Angelo gasses the rest of the crew, then flies the Vulcan to the [[Bahamas]], landing it in shallow water near Largo's ship, the ''[[Disco Volante (ship)|Disco Volante]]''. SPECTRE [[Scuba diving|scuba divers]], commanded by Largo, retrieve the atomic bombs. Angelo, trapped by his seat strapping, is left to drown by Largo for reneging on his original deal with SPECTRE.\n\nMeanwhile, Bond has uncovered Derval's corpse at the clinic. On the way to London, Lippe attacks Bond, but a masked motorcyclist kills Lippe with a rocket-propelled grenade and zooms off. Abandoning the motorcycle and unmasking, the rider is revealed to be Fiona, acting on Blofeld's orders to eliminate Lippe for hiring the greedy Angelo.\n\nAt an MI6 conference in London, all of the 00 agents are informed that SPECTRE demands \u00a3100 million from NATO in exchange for returning the bombs, and threatens to destroy a major city in the [[United States]] or the [[United Kingdom]] if the ransom is not paid within seven days. Bond recognises the briefing photograph of Derval as the corpse at Shrublands. He asks M to send him to [[Nassau, Bahamas]], to contact Derval's sister, [[Domino Vitali|Domino]].\n\nWhile snorkeling, Bond meets Domino. Later, at a casino, he encounters Largo and Domino, who is his mistress. Bond enters a game against Largo and wins, and subsequently takes Domino to a dance. Bond and Largo recognise each other as adversaries and begin a tense cat-and-mouse game while still pretending ignorance of each other's true nature. Bond meets [[Felix Leiter]] and [[Q (James Bond)|Q]], and is issued various gadgets, including an underwater infrared camera, a distress beacon, underwater breathing apparatus, a flare gun, and a [[Geiger counter]]. Diving under the ''Disco Volante'', Bond fails to find the atomic bombs, but detects an underwater hatch; Bond narrowly escapes Largo's henchmen. The next day, Bond visits Largo at his estate, Palmyra. Bond's partner, Paula Caplan, is taken to Palmyra and then commits suicide with a cyanide pill rather than give any information.\n\nBond is kidnapped by Volpe, but escapes through a [[Junkanoo]] celebration to the Kiss Kiss club, where Volpe is accidentally shot and killed by her own bodyguard. Bond and Felix search for the Vulcan, finding it underwater and inside a camouflaged cargo net. Bond tells Domino that Largo killed her brother and asks her for help in finding the bombs, giving her the Geiger counter. As she searches for the bombs on the ship, she is caught and tortured by Largo.\n\nMeanwhile, Bond disguises himself as one of Largo's henchmen, and uncovers Largo's plan to destroy [[Miami Beach]]. Bond is discovered and trapped by Largo, but rescued by Leiter in a [[United States Coast Guard]] helicopter, allowing him to alert the authorities of Largo's plan. [[U.S. Navy]] [[frogmen]] parachute into the area from a [[US Air Force]] transport aircraft, with Bond joining them, and after an underwater battle, Largo's divers surrender. Largo escapes to the ''Disco Volante'', which has one of the bombs on board. As it begins to leave, Bond gets on an underwater fin, and [[Royal Navy]] and U.S. Coast Guard vessels pursue the ''Disco Volante''. Largo has the ship start creating a smoke cloud, and when the Royal Navy and U.S. vessels start to close in, he has the rear of the ship jettisoned, revealing the front to be a [[hydrofoil]], which escapes at high speed. Bond climbs into the ship's bridge, where he battles Largo and two crewmen while controlling the ship as it weaves erratically among rocks and reefs. Meanwhile, Largo's hired nuclear physicist Kutze frees Domino. Largo is just about to shoot Bond when Domino shoots and kills Largo with a harpoon gun. Bond, Domino, and Kutze jump overboard before the ship runs aground and explodes. A [[Fulton surface-to-air recovery system|sky hook]]-equipped CIA [[B-17]] aircraft then rescues Bond and Domino.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Sean Connery]] as [[James Bond filmography|James Bond]]: An MI6 agent assigned to retrieve two stolen nuclear weapons\n<!-- title cards -->\n* [[Claudine Auger]] as Domino (voice dubbed by [[Nikki van der Zyl]]):<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nikkivanderzyl.co.uk/bond/|title=Film Industry Tricks OR How to fool most of the people most of the time!|publisher=Official Nikki van der Zyl website|author=George A.

Eventually, former [[Miss France]] [[Claudine Auger]] was cast, and the script was rewritten to make her character French rather than Italian, although her lines were dubbed in the final cut by [[Nikki van der Zyl]], who had voiced several previous Bond girls. Nevertheless, director Young cast her once again in his next film, ''[[Triple Cross (1966 film)|Triple Cross]]'' (1966).

Years later, Young said ''Thunderball'' was filmed \"at the right time\",<ref name=\"TerenceYoung\"/> considering that if it was the first film in the series, the low budget (''Dr. No'' cost only $1 million) would not have yielded good results.<ref name=\"TerenceYoung\">{{cite AV media |people = [[Terence Young (director)|Young, Terence]] |title = Commentary 1: Thunderball Ultimate Edition DVD Region 4 |medium = DVD |publisher = MGM/UA Home Entertainment}}</ref> ''Thunderball'' was the final James Bond film directed by Young.\n\nFilming commenced on 16 February 1965, with principal photography of the opening scene in Paris. Filming then moved to the [[Ch\u00e2teau d'Anet]], near [[Dreux]], France, for the fight in precredit sequence. Much of the film was shot in the Bahamas; ''Thunderball'' is widely known for its extensive underwater action scenes which are played out through much of the latter half of the film.

The most difficult sequences to film were the underwater action scenes; the first to be shot underwater was at a depth of 50 feet to shoot the scene where SPECTRE divers remove the atomic bombs from the sunken Vulcan bomber. [[Peter Lamont]] had previously visited a Royal Air Force bomber station carrying a concealed camera which he used to get close-up shots of secret missiles (those appearing in the film were not actually present).<ref name=\"making of\" /> Most of the underwater scenes had to be done at lower tides due to the sharks on the Bahamian coast.<ref>{{cite AV media  |title = Commentary 1: Thunderball Ultimate Edition, Region 2 }}</ref>\n\nAfter he read the script, Connery realised the risk of the sequence with the sharks in Largo's pool and insisted that production designer [[Ken Adam]] build a [[Plexiglas]] partition inside the pool. The barrier was not a fixed structure, so when one of the sharks managed to pass through it, Connery fled the pool, seconds away from attack.<ref name=\"ttp\"/> Ken Adam later told UK daily newspaper ''[[The Guardian]]'',\n\n<blockquote>We had to use special effects, but unlike special effects today, they were real. The jet pack we used in ''Thunderball'' was real - it was invented for the United States Army. Bloody dangerous, and it only lasted a couple of minutes. The ejector seat in the Aston Martin was real and Emilio Largo's boat, the ''Disco Volante'', was real. You had power boats at that time, but there were no good-sized yachts that were able to travel at 40 to 50 knots, so it was quite a problem. But by combining a hydrofoil, which we bought in Puerto Rico for $10,000, and a catamaran, it at least looked like a big yacht. We combined the two hulls with a one-inch slip bolt and when they split it worked like a dream. We used lots of sharks for this movie. I'd rented a villa in the Bahamas with a saltwater pool which we filled with sharks and used for underwater filming. The smell was horrendous. This was where Sean Connery came close to being bitten. We had a plexiglass corridor to protect him, but I didn't have quite enough plexiglass and one of the sharks got through.

[[Voit]] provided much of the underwater gear in exchange for [[product placement]] and film [[tie-in]] merchandise. Lamar Boren, an underwater photographer, was hired to shoot all of the sequences. [[United States Air Force]] Lieutenant Colonel [[Charles Russhon]], who had already established Eon productions' rapports with the local authorities in Turkey for ''From Russia with Love'' (1963) and at [[Fort Knox]] for ''Goldfinger'' (1964), supplied the experimental rocket fuel used to destroy the ''Disco Volante''.

He personally directed the first few productions of all his plays, and dedicated ''If Winter Comes'' to his \"comrades of [[Budapest]] and [[Prague]]\",<ref name=timesonline/> which caused some controversy, in the sensitive political climate, coming so soon after the Paris riots of 1968.<ref name=magyarnarancs/>  The original Paris production was entitled ''Le Ciel est en bas'', and presented at the [[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de l'Ath\u00e9n\u00e9e]] in 1970, starring [[Jean Servais]]<ref group=n>''Le Ciel est en bas'' (Theatre Programme), L'Ath\u00e9n\u00e9e, Paris, 1970</ref><ref name=timesonline/>  The play was both a critical and commercial success,<ref name=magyarnarancs/> with subsequent stage productions in major theatres as far afield as Austria, Germany, England, Scotland, Wales, Australia, the United States, and even in Hungary, over the following thirty years.  Ny\u00edri's work was often adapted for the screen, in England, Germany, and Hungary.<ref group=n>''Ha m\u00e1r itt a t\u00e9l'' (Film), Magyar Telev\u00edzi\u00f3/MaFilm, Budapest, 1985</ref> In 1980 ''If Winter Comes'' was turned into a television film for [[BBC Films]], starring [[Paul Scofield]], [[Denis Lawson]] and [[Cherie Lunghi]].<ref group=n>''If Winter Comes'' (Film), BBC, London, 1980</ref><ref name=timesonline/>\n\n==Novels==\nNy\u00edri's first novel to be published in English, ''Streets'' (Wildwood House, London<ref group=n>''Streets'' (Book), Wildwood House, London, 1979</ref>), was widely praised in the British press, for its depiction of the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Hungarian Revolution]] against the [[Soviet occupation]] of the 1950s.<ref name=timesonline/> ''Streets'' was on most book of the year lists for 1979 and quickly attracted critical success.

It was completed in 2002, shortly before his death.<ref name=timesonline/>\n\nIt was his second novel, of which the [[Wall Street Journal]] wrote: \"Although hardly a month passes without some new account surfacing about a writer\u2019s childhood during the Holocaust, nothing in recent memory approaches the greatness \u2014 the narrative beauty, the sublime character portraits and the cliff-hanging tension and drama \u2014 of ''Battlefields and Playgrounds''\".<ref name=timesonline/> The [[Boston Globe]] praised the book as: \"a panorama of historic events, a cross-section of society\u2019s attitudes at the point of an ultimate test of its values, an exploration of a growing child\u2019s consciousness, a story of a family\u2019s struggle to survive, a dramatic novel of suspense, is also, perhaps most importantly, a treatise on the nature and limits of liberty\u2026 At the same time, it is a gigantic portion of what we all\u2026 secretly dream of finding in any novel: a riveting story, an engaging protagonist, an enthralling narrative, a convincing portrayal of a human predicament\". ''Battlefields and Playgrounds'' was also Book of the Year in the ''[[Financial Times]]'' and chosen by ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' as one of the best books of 1995 in the USA.\n\n==Legacy==\nJ\u00e1nos Ny\u00edri is survived by his wife, Jenny, a brother and sister, a son and daughter and six grandchildren.\n\n==Works==\n*''The Imaginary Invalid'' (Theatre Programme), Vaudeville, London, 1968\n*''Le Ciel est en bas'' (Theatre Programme), [[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de l'Ath\u00e9n\u00e9e|L'Ath\u00e9n\u00e9e]], Paris, 1970\n**''If Winter Comes'' (Film), [[BBC]], London, 1980\n**''Ha m\u00e1r itt a t\u00e9l'' (Film), [[Magyar Telev\u00edzi\u00f3]]/MaFilm, Budapest, 1985\n*[http://nyir2u.wordpress.com/2014/05/05/a-chilly-spring-in-budapest-by-janos-nyiri/ \"A Chilly Spring in Budapest\"] (Magazine Article), ''[[New Statesman]]'', London, 8 June 1973\n*''Streets'' (Book), Wildwood House, London, 1979\n*''Battlefields and Playgrounds'' (Book), [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]], London, 1989; [[Farrar, Straus and Giroux]], New York, 1992.

He was born in [[Baia Mare|Nagyb\u00e1nya]] the son of J\u00f3zsef N\u00e9meth (1873\u20131946) and Vilma Ga\u00e1l (1879\u20131957). Over the Christmas of 1925, he married Ella D\u00e9musz (1905\u20131989), the daughter of J\u00e1nos D\u00e9musz, a keeper of a [[Pub|public house]]. Between 1926 and 1944 they had six daughters, but two of them died in infancy. In 1959 he visited the [[Soviet Union]]. In the last part of his life he lived and worked in [[Tihany]].  He died from a [[stroke]] on 3 March 1975 in Budapest and was buried in [[Farkasr\u00e9ti Cemetery]], Budapest, where he shares a grave with his wife.\n\n==Medical and teaching career==\nN\u00e9meth was awarded a degree in [[dentistry]] in 1925, and worked in Szent J\u00e1nos ({{lang-en|Saint John}}) Hospital. He founded a dental practice, but later became a medical practitioner for schools.\n\nIn 1926 he opened his dental surgery, although he continued to work as a [[Freelancer|freelance]] at the Saint John's Hospital in the Department of [[Neurology]]. He was a medical practitioner for Toldy School from 1926 to 1927, at the Egressy Street School from 1928 to 1931, and at Medve Street School from 1933 to 1943, when he retired as a medical practitioner. In the winter of 1927 he contracted [[tuberculosis]] and travelled to [[Italy]] and [[G\u00f6d|Fels\u0151g\u00f6d]] to [[convalescence|convalesce]], retiring from his career as a dentist.\n\nBetween 1945 and 1948 he was a casual teacher in the history of Hungarian literature, in mathematics, and other subjects, at the grammar school in [[H\u00f3dmez\u0151v\u00e1s\u00e1rhely]]. In 1946 Minister of Education [[Dezs\u0151 Keresztury]] offered him a job as a school inspector for the College of Further Education, and he worked arranging the college's [[curriculum]].\n\n==Literary career==\nIn December 1925 N\u00e9meth won the first prize in a competition run by [[Nyugat]] magazine for his novel {{lang|hu|Horv\u00e1thn\u00e9 meghal}}, (\"Mrs Horv\u00e1th Died\").\n\nFrom 1926 he wrote articles and book reviews for Nyugat magazine, the {{lang|hu|Protest\u00e1ns Szemle}} (\"[[Protestantism|Protestant]] Review\", {{lang|hu|T\u00e1rsadalomtudom\u00e1ny}} (\"Social Science\"), {{lang|hu|Erd\u00e9lyi Helikon}} (\"[[Transylvania]]n Helikon\") and {{lang|hu|Napkelet}} (\"Sunrise\"), for which he was the leading critic until 1931. (In the \"Protestant Review\" and \"Sunrise\" he wrote under the [[pen name]] of L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Lelkes.\n\nIn 1927 he became a staff writer for {{lang|hu|Napkelet}}. The following year he and his wife travelled to [[Italy]] and [[France]]. In 1929 he had his first [[novel]] published in that magazine, {{lang|hu|Emberi sz\u00ednj\u00e1t\u00e9k}} (\"Human [[Play (theatre)|Play]]\"). In 1930, he was awarded the [[Baumgarten Prize]], but he returned it after receiving criticism from {{ill|Lajos Hatvany|hu|Hatvany Lajos}}. In 1931 he took a {{lang|hu|\u00e9retts\u00e9gi}} \u2013 the equivalent of a [[General Certificate of Education]] \u2013 in [[Greek language]], and later he studied it at university for a short while.\n\nOn 29 November 1931 he attended a literary dinner in [[Debrecen]] hosted by the Ady Association, where five [[folklore|folk writers]] ({{ill|J\u00f3zsef Erd\u00e9lyi|hu|Erd\u00e9lyi J\u00f3zsef (k\u00f6lt\u0151)}}, [[Gyula Illy\u00e9s]], [[J\u00e1nos Kodol\u00e1nyi]], [[L\u0151rinc Szab\u00f3]] and himself) were warmly received at their public reading.\n\nHis relationship with Nyugat magazine was somewhat strained,<ref>{{citation\n  | first      = L\u00e1szl\u00f3\n  | last       = F\u00fczi\n  | url        = http://www.forrasfolyoirat.hu/0111/fuzi.html\n  | title      = N\u00e9meth's Letters to J\u00e1nos Hartmann\n  | language   = Hungarian\n  | accessdate = 29 November 2009\n}}</ref> and in the 1930s he had confrontations with the editor, [[Mih\u00e1ly Babits]], who was a trustee of the Baumgarten Foundation.<!-- a movement, but uselss to translate -->, because of his criticism of {{ill|Sophie T\u00f6r\u00f6k|hu|Tanner Ilona}}. His relationship with Nyugat broke down. In 1943 he wrote a monograph {{lang|hu|Magam helyett}} (\"Instead of me\")<ref>{{citation\n  | title             = Magam helyett \u2013 tanulm\u00e1nyok az \u00e9letemr\u0151l\n  | trans-title       = Instead of me \u2013 monographs on my life\n  | publisher         = P\u00fcski\n  | publication-place = Budapest\n  | year              = 2002\n  | isbn              = 963-9337-70-6\n  | pages             = 344\u2013347\n  | language          = Hungarian\n}}</ref> in which he stated that one of the reasons for this breakdown was Kodol\u00e1nyi, who disliked the fact that N\u00e9meth had written a strongly worded letter to L\u00f3r\u00e1nt Basch, who was also a trustee of the Baumgarten Foundation, suggesting that Kodol\u00e1nyi should be given financial assistance. Because of this, the other trustee, [[Mih\u00e1ly Babits]] didn't want to help him. It ended embarrassingly, as N\u00e9meth was in Babits' flat when Basch telephoned Babits to tell him about N\u00e9meth's letter.<ref>From 1932 N\u00e9meth didn\u2019t write for Nyugat, he founded a new periodical, {{lang|hu|Tan\u00fa}} (\"Witness\") and later {{lang|hu|V\u00e1lasz}} (\"Answer\").</ref>\n\nOn 26 September N\u00e9meth founded the {{lang|hu|Tan\u00fa}} (\"Witness\")  magazine, which published 17 issues until 1937. From April 1934 he edited the {{lang|hu|V\u00e1lasz}} (\"Answer\") newspaper with {{ill|Lajos F\u00fclep|hu|F\u00fclep Lajos}} and {{ill|P\u00e1l Guly\u00e1s|hu|Guly\u00e1s P\u00e1l (k\u00f6lt\u0151)}} and from 1934 to 1935 he was Head of the Department of Literature at the [[Magyar R\u00e1di\u00f3]] (Hungarian Radio Corporation). During his leadership he tried to encourage and promote contemporary Hungarian literature. In his programmes there were many writers and poets who read their own works and discussed them with N\u00e9meth \u2013 they became well known at the time.  The programme became very popular and it influenced later Hungarian literature and the Hungarian Radio Corporation's programme scheduling policy.\n\n[[File:N\u00e9meth L\u00e1szl\u00f3 s\u00edrja.jpg|thumb|right|260px|N\u00e9meth's grave in Farkasr\u00e9ti Cemetery, Budapest]]\nIn 1934 N\u00e9meth's had his first book published, {{lang|hu|Ember \u00e9s szerep}} (\"Human and role\").

dentist, writer, dramatist and essayist. He was born in [[Baia Mare|Nagyb\u00e1nya]] the son of J\u00f3zsef N\u00e9meth (1873\u20131946) and Vilma Ga\u00e1l (1879\u20131957). Over the Christmas of 1925, he married Ella D\u00e9musz (1905\u20131989), the daughter of J\u00e1nos D\u00e9musz, a keeper of a [[Pub|public house]]. Between 1926 and 1944 they had six daughters, but two of them died in infancy. In 1959 he visited the [[Soviet Union]]. In the last part of his life he lived and worked in [[Tihany]].  He died from a [[stroke]] on 3 March 1975 in Budapest and was buried in [[Farkasr\u00e9ti Cemetery]], Budapest, where he shares a grave with his wife.\n\n==Medical and teaching career==\nN\u00e9meth was awarded a degree in [[dentistry]] in 1925, and worked in Szent J\u00e1nos ({{lang-en|Saint John}}) Hospital. He founded a dental practice, but later became a medical practitioner for schools.\n\nIn 1926 he opened his dental surgery, although he continued to work as a [[Freelancer|freelance]] at the Saint John's Hospital in the Department of [[Neurology]]. He was a medical practitioner for Toldy School from 1926 to 1927, at the Egressy Street School from 1928 to 1931, and at Medve Street School from 1933 to 1943, when he retired as a medical practitioner. In the winter of 1927 he contracted [[tuberculosis]] and travelled to [[Italy]] and [[G\u00f6d|Fels\u0151g\u00f6d]] to [[convalescence|convalesce]], retiring from his career as a dentist.\n\nBetween 1945 and 1948 he was a casual teacher in the history of Hungarian literature, in mathematics, and other subjects, at the grammar school in [[H\u00f3dmez\u0151v\u00e1s\u00e1rhely]]. In 1946 Minister of Education [[Dezs\u0151 Keresztury]] offered him a job as a school inspector for the College of Further Education, and he worked arranging the college's [[curriculum]].\n\n==Literary career==\nIn December 1925 N\u00e9meth won the first prize in a competition run by [[Nyugat]] magazine for his novel {{lang|hu|Horv\u00e1thn\u00e9 meghal}}, (\"Mrs Horv\u00e1th Died\").\n\nFrom 1926 he wrote articles and book reviews for Nyugat magazine, the {{lang|hu|Protest\u00e1ns Szemle}} (\"[[Protestantism|Protestant]] Review\", {{lang|hu|T\u00e1rsadalomtudom\u00e1ny}} (\"Social Science\"), {{lang|hu|Erd\u00e9lyi Helikon}} (\"[[Transylvania]]n Helikon\") and {{lang|hu|Napkelet}} (\"Sunrise\"), for which he was the leading critic until 1931. (In the \"Protestant Review\" and \"Sunrise\" he wrote under the [[pen name]] of L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Lelkes.\n\nIn 1927 he became a staff writer for {{lang|hu|Napkelet}}. The following year he and his wife travelled to [[Italy]] and [[France]]. In 1929 he had his first [[novel]] published in that magazine, {{lang|hu|Emberi sz\u00ednj\u00e1t\u00e9k}} (\"Human [[Play (theatre)|Play]]\"). In 1930, he was awarded the [[Baumgarten Prize]], but he returned it after receiving criticism from {{ill|Lajos Hatvany|hu|Hatvany Lajos}}. In 1931 he took a {{lang|hu|\u00e9retts\u00e9gi}} \u2013 the equivalent of a [[General Certificate of Education]] \u2013 in [[Greek language]], and later he studied it at university for a short while.\n\nOn 29 November 1931 he attended a literary dinner in [[Debrecen]] hosted by the Ady Association, where five [[folklore|folk writers]] ({{ill|J\u00f3zsef Erd\u00e9lyi|hu|Erd\u00e9lyi J\u00f3zsef (k\u00f6lt\u0151)}}, [[Gyula Illy\u00e9s]], [[J\u00e1nos Kodol\u00e1nyi]], [[L\u0151rinc Szab\u00f3]] and himself) were warmly received at their public reading.\n\nHis relationship with Nyugat magazine was somewhat strained,<ref>{{citation\n  | first      = L\u00e1szl\u00f3\n  | last       = F\u00fczi\n  | url        = http://www.forrasfolyoirat.hu/0111/fuzi.html\n  | title      = N\u00e9meth's Letters to J\u00e1nos Hartmann\n  | language   = Hungarian\n  | accessdate = 29 November 2009\n}}</ref> and in the 1930s he had confrontations with the editor, [[Mih\u00e1ly Babits]], who was a trustee of the Baumgarten Foundation.<!-- a movement, but uselss to translate -->, because of his criticism of {{ill|Sophie T\u00f6r\u00f6k|hu|Tanner Ilona}}. His relationship with Nyugat broke down. In 1943 he wrote a monograph {{lang|hu|Magam helyett}} (\"Instead of me\")<ref>{{citation\n  | title             = Magam helyett \u2013 tanulm\u00e1nyok az \u00e9letemr\u0151l\n  | trans-title       = Instead of me \u2013 monographs on my life\n  | publisher         = P\u00fcski\n  | publication-place = Budapest\n  | year              = 2002\n  | isbn              = 963-9337-70-6\n  | pages             = 344\u2013347\n  | language          = Hungarian\n}}</ref> in which he stated that one of the reasons for this breakdown was Kodol\u00e1nyi, who disliked the fact that N\u00e9meth had written a strongly worded letter to L\u00f3r\u00e1nt Basch, who was also a trustee of the Baumgarten Foundation, suggesting that Kodol\u00e1nyi should be given financial assistance. Because of this, the other trustee, [[Mih\u00e1ly Babits]] didn't want to help him. It ended embarrassingly, as N\u00e9meth was in Babits' flat when Basch telephoned Babits to tell him about N\u00e9meth's letter.<ref>From 1932 N\u00e9meth didn\u2019t write for Nyugat, he founded a new periodical, {{lang|hu|Tan\u00fa}} (\"Witness\") and later {{lang|hu|V\u00e1lasz}} (\"Answer\").</ref>\n\nOn 26 September N\u00e9meth founded the {{lang|hu|Tan\u00fa}} (\"Witness\")  magazine, which published 17 issues until 1937. From April 1934 he edited the {{lang|hu|V\u00e1lasz}} (\"Answer\") newspaper with {{ill|Lajos F\u00fclep|hu|F\u00fclep Lajos}} and {{ill|P\u00e1l Guly\u00e1s|hu|Guly\u00e1s P\u00e1l (k\u00f6lt\u0151)}} and from 1934 to 1935 he was Head of the Department of Literature at the [[Magyar R\u00e1di\u00f3]] (Hungarian Radio Corporation). During his leadership he tried to encourage and promote contemporary Hungarian literature. In his programmes there were many writers and poets who read their own works and discussed them with N\u00e9meth \u2013 they became well known at the time.  The programme became very popular and it influenced later Hungarian literature and the Hungarian Radio Corporation's programme scheduling policy.\n\n[[File:N\u00e9meth L\u00e1szl\u00f3 s\u00edrja.jpg|thumb|right|260px|N\u00e9meth's grave in Farkasr\u00e9ti Cemetery, Budapest]]\nIn 1934 N\u00e9meth's had his first book published, {{lang|hu|Ember \u00e9s szerep}} (\"Human and role\").

On 13 May 1939 the National Theatre introduced his historical play, ''VII.

During [[World War II]] he worked for ''Kelet N\u00e9pe'', the ''H\u00edd'' (\"Bridge\") and the ''{{ill|Magyar Csillag|hu}}'' (\"Hungarian Star\") periodicals. N\u00e9meth collected his monographs and published them in a book called ''A min\u0151s\u00e9g forradalma'' (\"The Revolution of Quality\").

After her [[arranged marriage]], Nelli's marriage and life are unhappy. She hates being dependent on her husband, hates the prison of her marriage. Her husband, Sanyi Takar\u00f3, abuses her body and soul. Nelli tries to be a good housekeeper, but at the same time a bad wife, because she wants to annoy her husband in the hope that he will leave her<!-- divorce her?-->. Her husband, however, tries to make his marriage as happy as possible and looks up to his wife as a goddess. Sanyi becomes jealous of one of their friends, even though he knows that Nelli is not interested in him. As the marriage goes downhill Sanyi has affairs with servant girls. The marriage ends with his death: he is very ill and, against doctor's advice, he tries to have sex with Nelli, who resists. In the middle of the battle his heart stops as Nelli smothers his face with a pillow.

The hotel is known for the \"Peabody Ducks\" that live on the hotel rooftop and make daily treks to the lobby.

Snowden as a wedding gift not long after it opened. The hotel had 75 rooms, with private bathrooms, and numerous elegant public rooms. Among its guests were Presidents [[Andrew Johnson]] and [[William McKinley]] and Confederate Generals [[Robert E. Lee]] and [[Nathan Bedford Forrest]]. [[Jefferson Davis]], the former President of the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]], lived there in 1870 when he worked as president of an insurance company.<ref>United States Census, 1870, Tennessee, Shelby Co., 4-WD Memphis, Peabody Hotel, Series: M593 Roll: 1562 Page: 147.</ref>  The hotel closed in 1923<ref name=\"PEABODYHIST\" /> in preparation for a move one block away.

Ahlschlager]].<ref name=\"historic-memphis.com\"/> Construction began less than a month after the old hotel closed.<ref name=\"historic-memphis.com\"/> The new hotel was built on the previous site of the Fransioli Hotel, a structure which looked nearly identical to the original Peabody Hotel.<ref name=\"FRANSIOLI\">{{Cite web|url=http://fransiolihotel.com/_wsn/page2.html|title=Fransioli Hotel History}}</ref> The new hotel opened on September 1, 1925.<ref name=\"historic-memphis.com\"/>\n\nBefore the mid-1960s, alcoholic beverages were sold in Tennessee only as sealed bottles in licensed liquor stores. A patron could bring a bottle acquired elsewhere into the hotel bar, ''The Creel'', where the bartender would tag it and mix drinks from it at the patron's request.\n\nThe hotel was sold to the Alsonett Hotel Group in 1953.<ref name=\"historic-memphis.com\"/> Deeply in debt by the early 1960s, it went bankrupt in 1965 and was sold in a foreclosure auction to [[Sheraton Hotels]]. It became the '''Sheraton-Peabody Hotel'''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tn.findacase.com/research/wfrmDocViewer.aspx/xq/fac.19740219_0009.TN.HTM/qx |title=FindACase &#124; 02/19/74 MEMPHIS HOUSING AUTHORITY v.

An Alabama investment group purchased the hotel in 1974 and reopened it briefly under its original name, but they declared bankruptcy on April 1, 1975, and it closed again.<ref name=\"historic-memphis.com\"/> Isadore Edwin Hanover purchased the hotel from the county on July 31, 1975, for $400,000 and sold it to his son-in-law, Jack A. Belz, for the same amount. Belz spent the next several years and $25 million renovating the landmark structure. The grand reopening in 1981 is widely considered a major catalyst for the Memphis downtown area's ongoing revitalization.\n\nThe Peabody Hotel is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].\n\n==Peabody Hotel Group==\nThe Peabody Hotel Group (PHG) operated two additional properties under the Peabody name for many years. The Peabody Orlando, near [[Orlando, Florida]], opened in 1986 as the second Peabody Hotel. It was sold on August 28, 2013 and was renamed [[Hyatt Regency Orlando]] on October 1, 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hotelnewsresource.com/article73579.html|title=The Peabody Orlando Sold to Hyatt for $717 Million|author=Hotel News Resource|date=29 August 2013|work=hotelnewsresource.com}}</ref> PHG operated a third hotel in [[Little Rock, Arkansas]] from 2002, when they assumed management of the former Excelsior Hotel, which was known as The Peabody Little Rock until 2013, when the property became a Marriott.<ref>[http://www.seattlepi.com/news/article/Little-Rock-s-Peabody-changing-to-Marriott-4477055.php ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130501005714/http://www.seattlepi.com/news/article/Little-Rock-s-Peabody-changing-to-Marriott-4477055.php |date=May 1, 2013 }}</ref> They also operated properties for a number of years under the Hilton name in Greenville, South Carolina and Little Rock, Arkansas.\n{{clear}}\n\n== Peabody Ducks ==\n {{multiple image|caption_align=center|header_align=center\n | align = right\n | direction = horizontal\n | image1 = Peabody Hotel Ducks.jpg\n | width1 = 200\n | image2 = 20150521 The Peabody Hotel lobby and ducks (3).JPG\n | width2 = 225\n | footer_align = center\n | footer = The Peabody Ducks in the Fountain\n}}\n\nThe Peabody is probably best known for a custom dating back to the 1930s. The General Manager of the time, Frank Schutt, had just returned from a weekend hunting trip in Arkansas. He and his friends found it amusing to leave three of their live English [[Call Duck]] decoys in the hotel fountain. The guests loved the idea, and since then, five [[Mallard]] ducks (one drake and four hens) have played in the fountain every day.<ref name=\"PEABODYHIST\" />\n\n[[File:20150521 The Peabody Hotel lobby and ducks (6).JPG|thumb|Duckmaster giving the ducks a feeding|left|upright]]\nIn 1940, a [[Bellhop|Bellman]] by the name of Edward Pembroke volunteered to care for the ducks.

Snowden as a wedding gift not long after it opened. The hotel had 75 rooms, with private bathrooms, and numerous elegant public rooms. Among its guests were Presidents [[Andrew Johnson]] and [[William McKinley]] and Confederate Generals [[Robert E. Lee]] and [[Nathan Bedford Forrest]]. [[Jefferson Davis]], the former President of the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]], lived there in 1870 when he worked as president of an insurance company.<ref>United States Census, 1870, Tennessee, Shelby Co., 4-WD Memphis, Peabody Hotel, Series: M593 Roll: 1562 Page: 147.</ref>  The hotel closed in 1923<ref name=\"PEABODYHIST\" /> in preparation for a move one block away.

A patron could bring a bottle acquired elsewhere into the hotel bar, ''The Creel'', where the bartender would tag it and mix drinks from it at the patron's request.\n\nThe hotel was sold to the Alsonett Hotel Group in 1953.<ref name=\"historic-memphis.com\"/> Deeply in debt by the early 1960s, it went bankrupt in 1965 and was sold in a foreclosure auction to [[Sheraton Hotels]].

An Alabama investment group purchased the hotel in 1974 and reopened it briefly under its original name, but they declared bankruptcy on April 1, 1975, and it closed again.<ref name=\"historic-memphis.com\"/> Isadore Edwin Hanover purchased the hotel from the county on July 31, 1975, for $400,000 and sold it to his son-in-law, Jack A. Belz, for the same amount. Belz spent the next several years and $25 million renovating the landmark structure. The grand reopening in 1981 is widely considered a major catalyst for the Memphis downtown area's ongoing revitalization.\n\nThe Peabody Hotel is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].\n\n==Peabody Hotel Group==\nThe Peabody Hotel Group (PHG) operated two additional properties under the Peabody name for many years. The Peabody Orlando, near [[Orlando, Florida]], opened in 1986 as the second Peabody Hotel.

The General Manager of the time, Frank Schutt, had just returned from a weekend hunting trip in Arkansas.

His pacifist articles and other publications written in 1918 were also published in German and French papers and were collected in a book called ''Egyszer\u0171 gondolatok'' (''Simple Thoughts'').\n\nHis story \"The Miraculous Mandarin\" (in Hungarian: ''A csod\u00e1latos mandarin''), a \u201cpantomime grotesque\u201d came out in 1916. It is the story which inspired [[B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k]], the famous Hungarian composer, to create in 1924 the ballet ''[[The Miraculous Mandarin]]''.\n\nAfter World War I, Lengyel went to the United States for a longer stay and published his experiences in 1922 in a book ''Amerikai napl\u00f3'' (''American Journal''). In the 1920s, he was active in the film industry. For some time, he was story editor at May-Film in [[Berlin]]. In 1929/30, he was co-director of a Budapest theatre. In 1931, he was sent by the Hungarian newspaper ''[[Pesti Napl\u00f3]]'' (''Pest Journal'') to London as its reporter. The story of his Utopian novel ''A boldog v\u00e1ros'' (''The Happy City'') came out in 1931; it was set in an American city that lay in the depths of a chasm created by the great [[1906 San Francisco earthquake|Californian earthquake]].\n\nHe moved to Hollywood, California in 1937 and became a screenwriter. Several of his stories were the basis of screenplays for films by [[Ernst Lubitsch]] which became worldwide successes, such as  ''[[Ninotchka]]'' (1939), for which he was nominated for the [[Academy Award]] for Best Writing, Original Story; ''[[To Be or Not to Be (1942 film)|To Be or Not to Be]]'' (1942), and the 1937 film ''[[Angel (1937 film)|Angel]]'', starring [[Marlene Dietrich]].\n\nLengyel returned to Europe in 1960 and settled down in Italy. In 1963, he received the Great Award of Rome for his literary works.\n\nAfter the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]], Lengyel often visited his home country and returned to live in [[Budapest]] in 1974. He died there shortly afterwards at the age of 94.\n\nThe city library of Balmaz\u00fajv\u00e1ros, his native town, was named after him in 2004. A complete list of Lengyel's works as well as the articles and references about him and his publications were compiled by one of the librarians on this occasion.<ref>Kun, J\u00f3zsefn\u00e9: ''Lengyel Menyh\u00e9rt.
