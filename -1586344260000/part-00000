It was followed by some of the best-known poems in the English language, including ''[[The Waste Land]]'' (1922), \"[[The Hollow Men]]\" (1925), \"[[Ash Wednesday (poem)|Ash Wednesday]]\" (1930), and ''[[Four Quartets]]'' (1943).<ref name=EB>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/184705/T-S-Eliot \"Thomas Stearns Eliot\"], ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica''.

Eliot's paternal grandfather, [[William Greenleaf Eliot]], had moved to [[St. Louis]], Missouri,<ref name=EB/><ref>Bush, Ronald, ''T. S. Eliot: The Modernist in History'' (New York, 1991), p. 72.</ref> to establish a Unitarian Christian church there. His father, [[Henry Ware Eliot]] (1843\u20131919), was a successful businessman, president and treasurer of the Hydraulic-Press Brick Company in St Louis. His mother, [[Charlotte Champe Stearns]] (1843\u20131929), wrote poetry and was a social worker, a new profession in the early 20th century. Eliot was the last of six surviving children. Known to family and friends as Tom, he was the namesake of his maternal grandfather, Thomas Stearns.\n\nEliot's childhood infatuation with literature can be ascribed to several factors. First, he had to overcome physical limitations as a child. Struggling from a congenital double [[inguinal hernia]], he could not participate in many physical activities and thus was prevented from socialising with his peers. As he was often isolated, his love for literature developed. Once he learned to read, the young boy immediately became obsessed with books, favouring tales of savage life, the Wild West, or [[Mark Twain]]'s thrill-seeking [[Tom Sawyer]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Worthen|first=John|title=T.S. Eliot: A Short Biography|year=2009|publisher=Haus Publishing|location=London|page=9}}</ref> In his memoir of Eliot, his friend Robert Sencourt comments that the young Eliot \"would often curl up in the window-seat behind an enormous book, setting the drug of dreams against the pain of living.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Sencourt|first=Robert|title=T.S. Eliot, A Memoir|year=1971|publisher=Garnstone Limited|location=London|page=18}}</ref> Secondly, Eliot credited his hometown with fuelling his literary vision: \"It is self-evident that St. Louis affected me more deeply than any other environment has ever done. I feel that there is something in having passed one's childhood beside the [[Mississippi River|big river]], which is incommunicable to those people who have not. I consider myself fortunate to have been born here, rather than in Boston, or New York, or London.\"<ref>Letter to Marquis Childs quoted in ''St. Louis Post Dispatch'' (15 October 1930) and in the address \"American Literature and the American Language\" delivered at [[Washington University in St. Louis]] (9 June 1953), published in Washington University Studies, ''New Series: Literature and Language'', no. 23 (St. Louis: Washington University Press, 1953), p. 6.</ref>\n\nFrom 1898 to 1905, Eliot attended [[Mary Institute and St. Louis Country Day School|Smith Academy]], the boys college preparatory division of [[Washington University in St. Louis|Washington University]], where his studies included Latin, Ancient Greek, French, and German. He began to write poetry when he was fourteen under the influence of [[Edward FitzGerald (poet)|Edward Fitzgerald]]'s translation of the ''[[Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam]].''

He first visited [[Marburg]], Germany, where he planned to take a summer programme, but when the [[First World War]] broke out he went to Oxford instead. At the time so many American students attended Merton that the [[Junior Common Room]] proposed a motion \"that this society abhors the [[Americanization]] of Oxford\". It was defeated by two votes after Eliot reminded the students how much they owed American culture.<ref name=SeymourJones1>Seymour-Jones, Carole.

Oxford is very pretty, but I don't like to be dead.\"<ref name=SeymourJones1/> Escaping Oxford, Eliot spent much of his time in London. This city had a monumental and life-altering effect on Eliot for several reasons, the most significant of which was his introduction to the influential American literary figure [[Ezra Pound]]. A connection through Aiken resulted in an arranged meeting and on 22 September 1914, Eliot paid a visit to Pound's flat. Pound instantly deemed Eliot \"worth watching\" and was crucial to Eliot's beginning career as a poet, as he is credited with promoting Eliot through social events and literary gatherings. Thus, according to biographer John Worthen, during his time in England Eliot \"was seeing as little of Oxford as possible\". He was instead spending long periods of time in London, in the company of Ezra Pound and \"some of the modern artists whom the war has so far spared... It was Pound who helped most, introducing him everywhere.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Worthen|first=John|title=T.S.

The couple formally separated in 1933 and in 1938 Vivienne's brother, Maurice, had her committed to a mental hospital, against her will, where she remained until her death of heart disease in 1947. \n\nTheir relationship became the subject of a 1984 play ''[[Tom & Viv (play)|Tom & Viv]]'', which in 1994 was adapted as a film of [[Tom & Viv|the same name]].\n\nIn a private paper written in his sixties, Eliot confessed: \"I came to persuade myself that I was in love with Vivienne simply because I wanted to burn my boats and commit myself to staying in England. And she persuaded herself (also under the influence of [Ezra] Pound) that she would save the poet by keeping him in England. To her, the marriage brought no happiness.

He was aware of this even early in his career. He wrote to J.H. Woods, one of his former Harvard professors, \"My reputation in London is built upon one small volume of verse, and is kept up by printing two or three more poems in a year. The only thing that matters is that these should be perfect in their kind, so that each should be an event.\"<ref>Eliot, T. S. \"Letter to J. H. Woods, April 21, 1919.\" ''The Letters of T. S. Eliot'', vol. I. Valerie Eliot (ed.), New York: Harcourt Brace, 1988, p. 285.</ref>\n\nTypically, Eliot first published his poems individually in periodicals or in small books or pamphlets and then collected them in books. His first collection was ''Prufrock and Other Observations'' (1917). In 1920, he published more poems in ''Ara Vos Prec'' (London) and ''Poems: 1920'' (New York). These had the same poems (in a different order) except that \"Ode\" in the British edition was replaced with \"Hysteria\" in the American edition. In 1925, he collected ''The Waste Land'' and the poems in ''Prufrock'' and ''Poems'' into one volume and added ''The Hollow Men'' to form ''Poems: 1909\u20131925''. From then on, he updated this work as ''Collected Poems''. Exceptions are ''Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats'' (1939), a collection of light verse; ''Poems Written in Early Youth'', posthumously published in 1967 and consisting mainly of poems published between 1907 and 1910 in ''[[The Harvard Advocate]]'', and ''Inventions of the March Hare: Poems 1909\u20131917'', material Eliot never intended to have published, which appeared posthumously in 1997.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theworld.com/~raparker/exploring/tseliot/works/poems/eliot-harvard-poems.html |title=T.

That I'm sure of. ... It wouldn't be what it is, and I imagine it wouldn't be so good; putting it as modestly as I can, it wouldn't be what it is if I'd been born in England, and it wouldn't be what it is if I'd stayed in America. It's a combination of things. But in its sources, in its emotional springs, it comes from America.\"<ref name=Hall25>{{cite journal\n |url         = http://www.parisreview.com/media/4738_ELIOT4.pdf\n |title       = The Art of Poetry No. 1\n |author      = Hall, Donald\n |authorlink  = Donald Hall\n |date        = Spring\u2013Summer 1959\n |journal   = The Paris Review\n |accessdate  = 7 November 2009\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20091003162716/http://www.parisreview.com/media/4738_ELIOT4.pdf\n |archivedate = 3 October 2009\n |df          = dmy-all\n}}</ref>\n\nCleo McNelly Kearns notes in her biography that Eliot was deeply influenced by Indic traditions, notably the [[Upanishads]]. From the Sanskrit ending of ''The Waste Land'' to the \"What Krishna meant\" section of ''Four Quartets'' shows how much Indic religions and more specifically Hinduism made up his philosophical basic for his thought process.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://www.academia.edu/5912809|title=T.

He himself wrote in his 1940 essay on W.B. Yeats: \"The kind of poetry that I needed to teach me the use of my own voice did not exist in English at all; it was only to be found in French.\" (\"Yeats\", ''On Poetry and Poets'', 1948).\n\n===''The Love Song of J.

Retrieved 23 April 2007.</ref> Although the character Prufrock seems to be middle-aged, Eliot wrote most of the poem when he was only twenty-two. Its now-famous opening lines, comparing the evening sky to \"a patient etherised upon a table\", were considered shocking and offensive, especially at a time when [[Georgian Poetry]] was hailed for its derivations of the nineteenth century [[romanticism|Romantic Poets]].<ref>See, for example, Eliot, T.

Its reception in London can be gauged from an unsigned review in ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]'' on 21 June 1917. \"The fact that these things occurred to the mind of Mr. Eliot is surely of the very smallest importance to anyone, even to himself.

Before the poem's publication as a book in December 1922, Eliot distanced himself from its vision of despair. On 15 November 1922, he wrote to [[Richard Aldington]], saying, \"As for ''The Waste Land'', that is a thing of the past so far as I am concerned and I am now feeling toward a new form and style.\"<ref>''The Letters of T. S. Eliot'', Vol.&nbsp;1, p.&nbsp;596.</ref> The poem is often read as a representation of the disillusionment of the post-war generation. Dismissing this view, Eliot commented in 1931, \"When I wrote a poem called ''The Waste Land'', some of the more approving critics said that I had expressed \u2018the disillusion of a generation\u2019, which is nonsense. I may have expressed for them their own illusion of being disillusioned, but that did not form part of my intention\"<ref>''The Poems of T.S. Eliot, Volume 1: Collected & Uncollected Poems''. Edited by Christopher Ricks and Jim McCue, Faber & Faber, 2015, p. 576</ref>\n\nThe poem is known for its obscure nature\u2014its slippage between satire and prophecy; its abrupt changes of speaker, location, and time. This structural complexity is one of the reasons why the poem has become a touchstone of [[Modernist poetry in English|modern literature]], a poetic counterpart to a novel published in the same year, [[James Joyce]]'s ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]''.<ref>MacCabe, Colin. ''T. S. Eliot''. Tavistock: Northcote House, 2006.</ref>\n\nAmong its best-known phrases are \"April is the cruellest month\", \"I will show you fear in a handful of dust\" and ''\"[[Shanti Mantra|Shantih shantih shantih]]\"''. The Sanskrit ''[[mantra]]'' ends the poem.\n\n===''The Hollow Men''===\n{{Main|The Hollow Men|The Hollow Men in popular culture}}\n''The Hollow Men'' appeared in 1925. For the critic [[Edmund Wilson]], it marked \"The nadir of the phase of despair and desolation given such effective expression in ''The Waste Land''.\"<ref>[[Edmund Wilson|Wilson, Edmund]]. \"Review of Ash Wednesday\", ''New Republic'', 20 August 1930.</ref> It is Eliot's major poem of the late 1920s. Similar to Eliot's other works, its themes are overlapping and fragmentary. Post-war Europe under the [[Treaty of Versailles]] (which Eliot despised), the difficulty of hope and religious conversion, Eliot's failed marriage.<ref>See, for instance, the biographically oriented work of one of Eliot's editors and major critics, Ronald Schuchard.</ref>\n\n[[Allen Tate]] perceived a shift in Eliot's method, writing, \"The mythologies disappear altogether in ''The Hollow Men''.\" This is a striking claim for a poem as indebted to [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]] as anything else in Eliot's early work, to say little of the modern English mythology\u2014the \"Old [[Guy Fawkes]]\" of the [[Gunpowder Plot]]\u2014or the colonial and [[Agrarianism|agrarian]] mythos of [[Joseph Conrad]] and [[James George Frazer]], which, at least for reasons of textual history, echo in ''The Waste Land''.<ref>Grant, Michael (ed.).

Published in 1930, it deals with the struggle that ensues when one who has lacked faith acquires it. Sometimes referred to as Eliot's \"conversion poem\", it is richly but ambiguously allusive, and deals with the aspiration to move from spiritual barrenness to hope for human [[salvation]]. Eliot's style of writing in ''Ash-Wednesday'' showed a marked shift from the poetry he had written prior to his 1927 conversion, and his post-conversion style continued in a similar vein. His style became less ironic, and the poems were no longer populated by multiple characters in dialogue. Eliot's subject matter also became more focused on his spiritual concerns and his Christian faith.<ref>Raine, Craig. ''T. S. Eliot'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 2006)</ref>\n\nMany critics were particularly enthusiastic about ''Ash-Wednesday''. [[Edwin Muir]] maintained that it is one of the most moving poems Eliot wrote, and perhaps the \"most perfect\", though it was not well received by everyone. The poem's groundwork of orthodox Christianity discomfited many of the more secular ''[[Intellectual|literati]]''.<ref name=EB/><ref name=Untermeyer>[[Louis Untermeyer|Untermeyer, Louis]].

This first edition had an illustration of the author on the cover. In 1954, the composer [[Alan Rawsthorne]] set six of the poems for speaker and orchestra in a work titled ''Practical Cats''. After Eliot's death, the book was adapted as the basis of the musical ''[[Cats (musical)|Cats]]'' by [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]], first produced in London's West End in 1981 and opening on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] the following year.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bl.uk/20th-century-literature/articles/an-introduction-to-old-possums-book-of-practical-cats|title=An introduction to Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats|website=The British Library|access-date=27 February 2018}}</ref>\n\n===''Four Quartets''===\n{{Main|Four Quartets}}\nEliot regarded ''Four Quartets'' as his masterpiece, and it is the work that led to his being awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]].<ref name=EB/> It consists of four long poems, each first published separately: ''[[Burnt Norton]]'' (1936), ''[[East Coker (poem)|East Coker]]'' (1940), ''[[The Dry Salvages]]'' (1941) and ''[[Little Gidding (poem)|Little Gidding]]'' (1942). Each has five sections. Although they resist easy characterisation, each poem includes meditations on the nature of time in some important respect\u2014[[theological]], historical, physical\u2014and its relation to the human condition. Each poem is associated with one of the four [[classical elements]], respectively: air, earth, water, and fire.\n\n''Burnt Norton'' is a meditative poem that begins with the narrator trying to focus on the present moment while walking through a garden, focusing on images and sounds like the bird, the roses, clouds, and an empty pool. The narrator's meditation leads him/her to reach \"the still point\" in which he doesn't try to get anywhere or to experience place and/or time, instead experiencing \"a grace of sense\". In the final section, the narrator contemplates the arts (\"Words\" and \"music\") as they relate to time. The narrator focuses particularly on the poet's art of manipulating \"Words [which] strain, / Crack and sometimes break, under the burden [of time], under the tension, slip, slide, perish, decay with imprecision, [and] will not stay in place, / Will not stay still.\" By comparison, the narrator concludes that \"Love is itself unmoving, / Only the cause and end of movement, / Timeless, and undesiring.\"\n\n''East Coker'' continues the examination of time and meaning, focusing in a famous passage on the nature of language and poetry. Out of darkness, Eliot offers a solution: \"I said to my soul, be still, and wait without hope.\"\n\n''The Dry Salvages'' treats the element of water, via images of river and sea. It strives to contain opposites: \"The past and future / Are conquered, and reconciled.\"\n\n''Little Gidding'' (the element of fire) is the most anthologised of the Quartets. Eliot's experiences as an air raid warden in [[the Blitz]] power the poem, and he imagines meeting [[Dante]] during the German bombing. The beginning of the Quartets (\"Houses / Are removed, destroyed\") had become a violent everyday experience; this creates an animation, where for the first time he talks of Love as the driving force behind all experience. From this background, the Quartets end with an affirmation of [[Julian of Norwich]]: \"All shall be well and / All manner of thing<!-- NOT \"things\" - Collected Poems, p.209 --> shall be well.\"\n\nThe ''Four Quartets'' cannot be understood without reference to Christian thought, traditions, and history. Eliot draws upon the theology, art, symbolism and language of such figures as Dante, and mystics [[St. John of the Cross]] and [[Julian of Norwich]]. The \"deeper communion\" sought in ''East Coker'', the \"hints and whispers of children, the sickness that must grow worse to find healing\", and the exploration which inevitably leads us home all point to the pilgrim's path along the road of [[sanctification]].{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\n==Plays==\n{{Main|Sweeney Agonistes|Murder in the Cathedral|The Rock (play)|The Family Reunion|The Cocktail Party|The Confidential Clerk|The Elder Statesman}}\nWith the important exception of ''Four Quartets'', Eliot directed much of his creative energies after ''Ash Wednesday'' to writing plays in verse, mostly comedies or plays with redemptive endings. He was long a critic and admirer of [[Elizabethan]] and [[Literature in English#Jacobean literature|Jacobean]] verse drama; witness his allusions to [[John Webster|Webster]], [[Thomas Middleton]], [[William Shakespeare]] and [[Thomas Kyd]] in ''The Waste Land''. In a 1933 lecture he said \"Every poet would like, I fancy, to be able to think that he had some direct social utility . . . . He would like to be something of a popular entertainer and be able to think his own thoughts behind a tragic or a comic mask. He would like to convey the pleasures of poetry, not only to a larger audience but to larger groups of people collectively; and the theatre is the best place in which to do it.\"<ref name=\"upuc\">Eliot, T. S. ''The Use of Poetry and the Use of Criticism'', Harvard University Press, 1933 (penultimate paragraph).</ref>\n\nAfter ''The Waste Land'' (1922), he wrote that he was \"now feeling toward a new form and style\". One project he had in mind was writing a play in verse, using some of the rhythms of early [[jazz]]. The play featured \"Sweeney\", a character who had appeared in a number of his poems. Although Eliot did not finish the play, he did publish two scenes from the piece. These scenes, titled ''Fragment of a Prologue'' (1926) and ''Fragment of an Agon'' (1927), were published together in 1932 as ''[[Sweeney Agonistes]]''. Although Eliot noted that this was not intended to be a one-act play, it is sometimes performed as one.<ref name=Gallup/>\n\nA pageant play by Eliot called ''The Rock'' was performed in 1934 for the benefit of churches in the [[Diocese of London]]. Much of it was a collaborative effort; Eliot accepted credit only for the authorship of one scene and the choruses.<ref name=Gallup/> [[George Bell (bishop)|George Bell]], the [[Bishop of Chichester]], had been instrumental in connecting Eliot with producer [[E. Martin Browne]] for the production of ''The Rock'', and later commissioned Eliot to write another play for the [[Canterbury Festival]] in 1935. This one, ''Murder in the Cathedral'', concerning the death of the martyr, [[Thomas Becket]], was more under Eliot's control. Eliot biographer [[Peter Ackroyd]] comments that \"for [Eliot], ''Murder in the Cathedral'' and succeeding verse plays offered a double advantage; it allowed him to practice poetry but it also offered a convenient home for his religious sensibility.\"<ref name=\"learner.org\"/> After this, he worked on more \"commercial\" plays for more general audiences: ''The Family Reunion'' (1939), ''The Cocktail Party'' (1949), ''The Confidential Clerk'', (1953) and ''The Elder Statesman'' (1958) (the latter three were produced by [[Henry Sherek]] and directed by [[E. Martin Browne]]<ref name=\"Darlington\">{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/36063|title=Henry Sherek|last=Darlington|first=W.

The Broadway production in New York of ''The Cocktail Party'' received the 1950 [[Tony Award]] for Best Play. Eliot wrote ''The Cocktail Party'' while he was a visiting scholar at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]].<ref>[https://www.ias.edu/files/pdfs/publications/letter-2007-spring.pdf T. S.

I settle upon a particular emotional situation, out of which characters and a plot will emerge. And then lines of poetry may come into being: not from the original impulse but from a secondary stimulation of the unconscious mind.\"<ref name=\"learner.org\"/>\n\n==Literary criticism==\nEliot also made significant contributions to the field of [[literary criticism]], strongly influencing the school of [[New Criticism]]. He was somewhat self-deprecating and minimising of his work and once said his criticism was merely a \"by-product\" of his \"private poetry-workshop\" But the critic [[William Empson]] once said, \"I do not know for certain how much of my own mind [Eliot] invented, let alone how much of it is a reaction against him or indeed a consequence of misreading him. He is a very penetrating influence, perhaps not unlike the east wind.\"<ref>quoted in Roger Kimball, \"A Craving for Reality\", ''The New Criterion'' Vol. 18, 1999.</ref>\n\nIn his critical essay \"[[Tradition and the Individual Talent]]\", Eliot argues that art must be understood not in a vacuum, but in the context of previous pieces of art. \"In a peculiar sense [an artist or poet] ... must inevitably be judged by the standards of the past.\"<ref name=bartleby1>{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/200/sw4.html |title=Tradition and the Individual Talent|author= Eliot, T. S. |work=The Sacred Wood |publisher=Bartleby.com |year=1930 |accessdate=3 August 2009}}</ref> This essay was an important influence over the New Criticism by introducing the idea that the value of a work of art must be viewed in the context of the artist's previous works, a \"simultaneous order\" of works (i.e., \"tradition\"). Eliot himself employed this concept on many of his works, especially on his long-poem ''The Waste Land''.<ref>[http://www.leidykla.vu.lt/fileadmin/Literatura/51_3/98-108.pdf Dirk Weidmann: ''And I Tiresias have foresuffered all...'']. In: ''LITERATURA'' 51 (3), 2009, pp. 98\u2013108.</ref>\n\nAlso important to New Criticism was the idea\u2014as articulated in Eliot's essay \"[[Hamlet and His Problems]]\"\u2014of an \"[[objective correlative]]\", which posits a connection among the words of the text and events, states of mind, and experiences.<ref name=Hamlet>{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/200/sw9.html |title=Hamlet and His Problems|author= Eliot, T. S. |work= The Sacred Wood |publisher=Bartleby.com |year=1921 |accessdate=3 August 2009}}</ref> This notion concedes that a poem means what it says, but suggests that there can be a non-subjective judgment based on different readers' different\u2014but perhaps corollary\u2014interpretations of a work.\n\nMore generally, New Critics took a cue from Eliot in regard to his \"'classical' ideals and his religious thought; his attention to the poetry and drama of the early seventeenth century; his deprecation of the Romantics, especially [[Shelley]]; his proposition that good poems constitute 'not a turning loose of emotion but an escape from emotion'; and his insistence that 'poets... at present must be difficult'.\"<ref>Burt, Steven and Lewin, Jennifer. \"Poetry and the New Criticism\". ''A Companion to Twentieth-Century Poetry'', Neil Roberts, ed. Malden, Massachusetts: Blackwell Publishers, 2001. p. 154</ref>\n\nEliot's essays were a major factor in the revival of interest in the [[metaphysical poets]]. Eliot particularly praised the metaphysical poets' ability to show experience as both psychological and sensual, while at the same time infusing this portrayal with\u2014in Eliot's view\u2014wit and uniqueness. Eliot's essay \"The Metaphysical Poets\", along with giving new significance and attention to metaphysical poetry, introduced his now well-known definition of \"unified sensibility\", which is considered by some to mean the same thing as the term \"metaphysical\".<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/journal_of_modern_literature/v027/27.1baker.html |title=Project MUSE |publisher=Muse.jhu.edu |accessdate=3 August 2009|doi=10.1353/jml.2004.0051 }}</ref><ref>A.

He had argued that a poet must write \"programmatic criticism\", that is, a poet should write to advance his own interests rather than to advance \"historical scholarship\". Viewed from Eliot's critical lens, ''The Waste Land'' likely shows his personal despair about [[World War I]] rather than an objective historical understanding of it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-2088/TS-Eliot |title=T.

Eliot :: The Waste Land And Criticism |encyclopedia=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |date=4 January 1965 |accessdate=3 August 2009}}</ref>\n\nLate in his career, Eliot focused much of his creative energy on writing for the theatre; some of his earlier critical writing, in essays such as \"Poetry and Drama\",<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/poetryanddrama029231mbp|title=Poetry And Drama|first=T. S.|last=Eliot|date=1 January 2000|publisher=Faber And Faber Limited.|accessdate=26 January 2017|via=Internet Archive}}</ref> \"Hamlet and his Problems\",<ref name=Hamlet /> and \"The Possibility of a Poetic Drama\",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/200/sw5.html|title=The Possibility of a Poetic Drama|author= Eliot, T. S. |year= 1921|work= The Sacred Wood: Essays on Poetry and Criticism|publisher=bartleby.com|accessdate=26 January 2017}}</ref> focused on the aesthetics of writing drama in verse.\n\n==Critical reception==\n\n===Responses to his poetry===\nThe writer Ronald Bush notes that Eliot's early poems like \"The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock\", \"Portrait of a Lady\", \"La Figlia Che Piange\", \"Preludes\", and \"Rhapsody on a Windy Night\" had \"[an] effect [that] was both unique and compelling, and their assurance staggered [Eliot's] contemporaries who were privileged to read them in manuscript. [Conrad] Aiken, for example, marveled at 'how sharp and complete and [[sui generis]] the whole thing was, from the outset. The wholeness is there, from the very beginning.'\"<ref name=\"english.illinois.edu\" />\n\nThe initial critical response to Eliot's ''The Waste Land'' was mixed. Bush notes that the piece was at first correctly perceived as a work of jazz-like syncopation\u2014and, like 1920s [[jazz]], essentially iconoclastic.\"<ref name=\"english.illinois.edu\"/> Some critics, like [[Edmund Wilson]], [[Conrad Aiken]], and [[Gilbert Seldes]] thought it was the best poetry being written in the English language while others thought it was esoteric and wilfully difficult. Edmund Wilson, being one of the critics who praised Eliot, called him \"one of our only authentic poets\".<ref name=\"Wilson, Edmund 1922\">Wilson, Edmund, \"The Poetry of Drouth\". ''The Dial'' 73. December 1922. 611\u201316.</ref> Wilson also pointed out some of Eliot's weaknesses as a poet. In regard to ''The Waste Land'', Wilson admits its flaws (\"its lack of structural unity\"), but concluded, \"I doubt whether there is a single other poem of equal length by a contemporary American which displays so high and so varied a mastery of English verse.\"<ref name=\"Wilson, Edmund 1922\"/>\n\nCharles Powell was negative in his criticism of Eliot, calling his poems incomprehensible.<ref>Powell, Charles, \"So Much Waste Paper\". ''Manchester Guardian'', 31 October 1923.</ref> And the writers of ''Time'' magazine were similarly baffled by a challenging poem like ''The Waste Land''.<ref>''Time'', 3 March 1923, 12.</ref> [[John Crowe Ransom]] wrote negative criticisms of Eliot's work but also had positive things to say. For instance, though Ransom negatively criticised ''The Waste Land'' for its \"extreme disconnection\", Ransom was not completely condemnatory of Eliot's work and admitted that Eliot was a talented poet.<ref>Ransom, John Crowe. \"Waste Lands\". ''New York Evening Post Literary Review'', 14 July 1923, pp. 825\u201326.</ref>\n\nAddressing some of the common criticisms directed against ''The Waste Land'' at the time, Gilbert Seldes stated, \"It seems at first sight remarkably disconnected and confused... [however] a closer view of the poem does more than illuminate the difficulties; it reveals the hidden form of the work, [and] indicates how each thing falls into place.\"<ref>Seldes, Gilbert. \"T. S. Eliot\". ''Nation'', 6 December 1922. 614\u2013616.</ref>\n\nEliot's reputation as a poet, as well as his influence in the academy, peaked following the publication of ''The Four Quartets''. In an essay on Eliot published in 1989, the writer [[Cynthia Ozick]] refers to this peak of influence (from the 1940s through the early 1960s) as \"the Age of Eliot\" when Eliot \"seemed pure zenith, a colossus, nothing less than a permanent luminary, fixed in the firmament like the sun and the moon\".<ref>{{cite web|first=Cynthia |last=Ozick| url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1989/11/20/t-s-eliot-at-101|title=T.S. ELIOT AT 101|work=The New Yorker|date=20 November 1989|accessdate=1 December 2016}}</ref> But during this post-war period, others, like Ronald Bush, observed that this time also marked the beginning of the decline in Eliot's literary influence: <blockquote>As Eliot's conservative religious and political convictions began to seem less congenial in the postwar world, other readers reacted with suspicion to his assertions of authority, obvious in ''Four Quartets'' and implicit in the earlier poetry. The result, fueled by intermittent rediscovery of Eliot's occasional anti-Semitic rhetoric, has been a progressive downward revision of his once towering reputation.<ref name=\"english.illinois.edu\"/></blockquote> Bush also notes that Eliot's reputation \"slipped\" significantly further after his death. He writes, \"Sometimes regarded as too academic ([[William Carlos Williams]]'s view), Eliot was also frequently criticized for a deadening [[neoclassicism]] (as he himself\u2014perhaps just as unfairly\u2014had criticized [[John Milton|Milton]]). However, the multifarious tributes from practicing poets of many schools published during his centenary in 1988 was a strong indication of the intimidating continued presence of his poetic voice.\"<ref name=\"english.illinois.edu\"/>\n\nAlthough Eliot's poetry is not as influential as it once was, notable literary scholars, like [[Harold Bloom]]<ref>Bloom, Harold. ''The Western Canon: Books and Schools of the Ages''. NY: Riverhead, 1995.</ref> and [[Stephen Greenblatt]],<ref name=Norton>Stephen Greenblatt, et al. (eds), ''The Norton Anthology of English Literature, Volume 2''. \"T.S. Eliot\". New York, NY: W.W. Norton & Co.: NY, NY, 2000.</ref> still acknowledge that Eliot's poetry is central to the literary English canon. For instance, the editors of ''The Norton Anthology of English Literature'' write, \"There is no disagreement on [Eliot's] importance as one of the great renovators of the English poetry dialect, whose influence on a whole generation of poets, critics, and intellectuals generally was enormous. [However] his range as a poet [was] limited, and his interest in the great middle ground of human experience (as distinct from the extremes of saint and sinner) [was] deficient.\" Despite this criticism, these scholars also acknowledge \"[Eliot's] poetic cunning, his fine craftsmanship, his original accent, his historical and representative importance as ''the'' poet of the modern [[Symbolism (arts)|symbolist]]-[[Metaphysical poets|Metaphysical]] tradition\".<ref name=Norton />\n\n===Anti-Semitism===\nThe depiction of Jews in some of Eliot's poems has led several critics to accuse him of [[anti-Semitism]]. This case has been presented most forcefully in a study by [[Anthony Julius]]: ''T. S. Eliot, Anti-Semitism, and Literary Form'' (1996).<ref>[[John Gross|Gross, John]].

S. Eliot'' (2001) and ''T. S. Eliot'' (2006), sought to defend Eliot from the charge of anti-Semitism. Reviewing the 2006 book, Paul Dean stated that he was not convinced by Raine's argument. Nevertheless, he concluded, \"Ultimately, as both Raine and, to do him justice, Julius insist, however much Eliot may have been compromised as a person, as we all are in our several ways, his greatness as a poet remains.\"<ref name = \"Dean\"/> In another review of Raine's 2006 book, the literary critic [[Terry Eagleton]] also questioned the validity of Raine's defence of Eliot's character flaws as well as the entire basis for Raine's book, writing, \"Why do critics feel a need to defend the authors they write on, like doting parents deaf to all criticism of their obnoxious children? Eliot's well-earned reputation [as a poet] is established beyond all doubt, and making him out to be as unflawed as the [[Gabriel|Archangel Gabriel]] does him no favours.\"<ref>Eagleton, Terry.

His work, in particular ''[[The Waste Land]]'', ''[[The Hollow Men]]'', and ''[[Ash Wednesday (poem)|Ash Wednesday]]'' strongly influenced the poetry of two of the most significant post-[[World War II|War]] [[Irish language]] poets, [[Se\u00e1n \u00d3 R\u00edord\u00e1in]] and [[M\u00e1irt\u00edn \u00d3 D\u00edre\u00e1in]]. Eliot was an influence on \u00d3 R\u00edord\u00e1in's later work although the Irish poet's relation to [[modernity]], and more particularly to modernisation, was uncomfortable from the outset.<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Dorgan|first1=Theo|author-link1=Theo Dorgan|url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/irish-poetry-since-kavanagh/oclc/35305248|title=Irish poetry since Kavanagh|date=1995|page=44|publisher=[[Four Courts Press]]|isbn=978-1-85182-239-3|location=Blackrock, Co.

Eliot's paternal grandfather, [[William Greenleaf Eliot]], had moved to [[St. Louis]], Missouri,<ref name=EB/><ref>Bush, Ronald, ''T. S. Eliot: The Modernist in History'' (New York, 1991), p. 72.</ref> to establish a Unitarian Christian church there. His father, [[Henry Ware Eliot]] (1843\u20131919), was a successful businessman, president and treasurer of the Hydraulic-Press Brick Company in St Louis. His mother, [[Charlotte Champe Stearns]] (1843\u20131929), wrote poetry and was a social worker, a new profession in the early 20th century. Eliot was the last of six surviving children. Known to family and friends as Tom, he was the namesake of his maternal grandfather, Thomas Stearns.\n\nEliot's childhood infatuation with literature can be ascribed to several factors. First, he had to overcome physical limitations as a child. Struggling from a congenital double [[inguinal hernia]], he could not participate in many physical activities and thus was prevented from socialising with his peers. As he was often isolated, his love for literature developed. Once he learned to read, the young boy immediately became obsessed with books, favouring tales of savage life, the Wild West, or [[Mark Twain]]'s thrill-seeking [[Tom Sawyer]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Worthen|first=John|title=T.S. Eliot: A Short Biography|year=2009|publisher=Haus Publishing|location=London|page=9}}</ref> In his memoir of Eliot, his friend Robert Sencourt comments that the young Eliot \"would often curl up in the window-seat behind an enormous book, setting the drug of dreams against the pain of living.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Sencourt|first=Robert|title=T.S. Eliot, A Memoir|year=1971|publisher=Garnstone Limited|location=London|page=18}}</ref> Secondly, Eliot credited his hometown with fuelling his literary vision: \"It is self-evident that St. Louis affected me more deeply than any other environment has ever done. I feel that there is something in having passed one's childhood beside the [[Mississippi River|big river]], which is incommunicable to those people who have not. I consider myself fortunate to have been born here, rather than in Boston, or New York, or London.\"<ref>Letter to Marquis Childs quoted in ''St. Louis Post Dispatch'' (15 October 1930) and in the address \"American Literature and the American Language\" delivered at [[Washington University in St. Louis]] (9 June 1953), published in Washington University Studies, ''New Series: Literature and Language'', no. 23 (St. Louis: Washington University Press, 1953), p. 6.</ref>\n\nFrom 1898 to 1905, Eliot attended [[Mary Institute and St. Louis Country Day School|Smith Academy]], the boys college preparatory division of [[Washington University in St. Louis|Washington University]], where his studies included Latin, Ancient Greek, French, and German. He began to write poetry when he was fourteen under the influence of [[Edward FitzGerald (poet)|Edward Fitzgerald]]'s translation of the ''[[Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam]].''

He first visited [[Marburg]], Germany, where he planned to take a summer programme, but when the [[First World War]] broke out he went to Oxford instead. At the time so many American students attended Merton that the [[Junior Common Room]] proposed a motion \"that this society abhors the [[Americanization]] of Oxford\". It was defeated by two votes after Eliot reminded the students how much they owed American culture.<ref name=SeymourJones1>Seymour-Jones, Carole.

Oxford is very pretty, but I don't like to be dead.\"<ref name=SeymourJones1/> Escaping Oxford, Eliot spent much of his time in London. This city had a monumental and life-altering effect on Eliot for several reasons, the most significant of which was his introduction to the influential American literary figure [[Ezra Pound]]. A connection through Aiken resulted in an arranged meeting and on 22 September 1914, Eliot paid a visit to Pound's flat. Pound instantly deemed Eliot \"worth watching\" and was crucial to Eliot's beginning career as a poet, as he is credited with promoting Eliot through social events and literary gatherings. Thus, according to biographer John Worthen, during his time in England Eliot \"was seeing as little of Oxford as possible\". He was instead spending long periods of time in London, in the company of Ezra Pound and \"some of the modern artists whom the war has so far spared... It was Pound who helped most, introducing him everywhere.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Worthen|first=John|title=T.S.

The couple formally separated in 1933 and in 1938 Vivienne's brother, Maurice, had her committed to a mental hospital, against her will, where she remained until her death of heart disease in 1947. \n\nTheir relationship became the subject of a 1984 play ''[[Tom & Viv (play)|Tom & Viv]]'', which in 1994 was adapted as a film of [[Tom & Viv|the same name]].\n\nIn a private paper written in his sixties, Eliot confessed: \"I came to persuade myself that I was in love with Vivienne simply because I wanted to burn my boats and commit myself to staying in England. And she persuaded herself (also under the influence of [Ezra] Pound) that she would save the poet by keeping him in England. To her, the marriage brought no happiness. To me, it brought the state of mind out of which came ''The Waste Land''.\"<ref>Eliot, T. S. ''The Letters of T. S. Eliot, Volume 1, 1898\u20131922.''

He was aware of this even early in his career. He wrote to J.H. Woods, one of his former Harvard professors, \"My reputation in London is built upon one small volume of verse, and is kept up by printing two or three more poems in a year. The only thing that matters is that these should be perfect in their kind, so that each should be an event.\"<ref>Eliot, T. S. \"Letter to J. H. Woods, April 21, 1919.\" ''The Letters of T. S. Eliot'', vol. I. Valerie Eliot (ed.), New York: Harcourt Brace, 1988, p. 285.</ref>\n\nTypically, Eliot first published his poems individually in periodicals or in small books or pamphlets and then collected them in books. His first collection was ''Prufrock and Other Observations'' (1917). In 1920, he published more poems in ''Ara Vos Prec'' (London) and ''Poems: 1920'' (New York). These had the same poems (in a different order) except that \"Ode\" in the British edition was replaced with \"Hysteria\" in the American edition. In 1925, he collected ''The Waste Land'' and the poems in ''Prufrock'' and ''Poems'' into one volume and added ''The Hollow Men'' to form ''Poems: 1909\u20131925''. From then on, he updated this work as ''Collected Poems''. Exceptions are ''Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats'' (1939), a collection of light verse; ''Poems Written in Early Youth'', posthumously published in 1967 and consisting mainly of poems published between 1907 and 1910 in ''[[The Harvard Advocate]]'', and ''Inventions of the March Hare: Poems 1909\u20131917'', material Eliot never intended to have published, which appeared posthumously in 1997.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theworld.com/~raparker/exploring/tseliot/works/poems/eliot-harvard-poems.html |title=T.

That I'm sure of. ... It wouldn't be what it is, and I imagine it wouldn't be so good; putting it as modestly as I can, it wouldn't be what it is if I'd been born in England, and it wouldn't be what it is if I'd stayed in America.

On 15 November 1922, he wrote to [[Richard Aldington]], saying, \"As for ''The Waste Land'', that is a thing of the past so far as I am concerned and I am now feeling toward a new form and style.\"<ref>''The Letters of T. S. Eliot'', Vol.&nbsp;1, p.&nbsp;596.</ref> The poem is often read as a representation of the disillusionment of the post-war generation. Dismissing this view, Eliot commented in 1931, \"When I wrote a poem called ''The Waste Land'', some of the more approving critics said that I had expressed \u2018the disillusion of a generation\u2019, which is nonsense. I may have expressed for them their own illusion of being disillusioned, but that did not form part of my intention\"<ref>''The Poems of T.S. Eliot, Volume 1: Collected & Uncollected Poems''. Edited by Christopher Ricks and Jim McCue, Faber & Faber, 2015, p. 576</ref>\n\nThe poem is known for its obscure nature\u2014its slippage between satire and prophecy; its abrupt changes of speaker, location, and time. This structural complexity is one of the reasons why the poem has become a touchstone of [[Modernist poetry in English|modern literature]], a poetic counterpart to a novel published in the same year, [[James Joyce]]'s ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]''.<ref>MacCabe, Colin. ''T. S. Eliot''. Tavistock: Northcote House, 2006.</ref>\n\nAmong its best-known phrases are \"April is the cruellest month\", \"I will show you fear in a handful of dust\" and ''\"[[Shanti Mantra|Shantih shantih shantih]]\"''. The Sanskrit ''[[mantra]]'' ends the poem.\n\n===''The Hollow Men''===\n{{Main|The Hollow Men|The Hollow Men in popular culture}}\n''The Hollow Men'' appeared in 1925. For the critic [[Edmund Wilson]], it marked \"The nadir of the phase of despair and desolation given such effective expression in ''The Waste Land''.\"<ref>[[Edmund Wilson|Wilson, Edmund]]. \"Review of Ash Wednesday\", ''New Republic'', 20 August 1930.</ref> It is Eliot's major poem of the late 1920s. Similar to Eliot's other works, its themes are overlapping and fragmentary. Post-war Europe under the [[Treaty of Versailles]] (which Eliot despised), the difficulty of hope and religious conversion, Eliot's failed marriage.<ref>See, for instance, the biographically oriented work of one of Eliot's editors and major critics, Ronald Schuchard.</ref>\n\n[[Allen Tate]] perceived a shift in Eliot's method, writing, \"The mythologies disappear altogether in ''The Hollow Men''.\" This is a striking claim for a poem as indebted to [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]] as anything else in Eliot's early work, to say little of the modern English mythology\u2014the \"Old [[Guy Fawkes]]\" of the [[Gunpowder Plot]]\u2014or the colonial and [[Agrarianism|agrarian]] mythos of [[Joseph Conrad]] and [[James George Frazer]], which, at least for reasons of textual history, echo in ''The Waste Land''.<ref>Grant, Michael (ed.).

Published in 1930, it deals with the struggle that ensues when one who has lacked faith acquires it. Sometimes referred to as Eliot's \"conversion poem\", it is richly but ambiguously allusive, and deals with the aspiration to move from spiritual barrenness to hope for human [[salvation]]. Eliot's style of writing in ''Ash-Wednesday'' showed a marked shift from the poetry he had written prior to his 1927 conversion, and his post-conversion style continued in a similar vein. His style became less ironic, and the poems were no longer populated by multiple characters in dialogue. Eliot's subject matter also became more focused on his spiritual concerns and his Christian faith.<ref>Raine, Craig. ''T. S. Eliot'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 2006)</ref>\n\nMany critics were particularly enthusiastic about ''Ash-Wednesday''. [[Edwin Muir]] maintained that it is one of the most moving poems Eliot wrote, and perhaps the \"most perfect\", though it was not well received by everyone. The poem's groundwork of orthodox Christianity discomfited many of the more secular ''[[Intellectual|literati]]''.<ref name=EB/><ref name=Untermeyer>[[Louis Untermeyer|Untermeyer, Louis]].

Hartcourt Brace, 1950, pp. 395\u2013396.</ref>\n\n===''Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats''===\n{{Main|Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats}}\nIn 1939, Eliot published a book of [[light verse]], ''Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats'' (\"Old Possum\" was Ezra Pound's nickname for him). This first edition had an illustration of the author on the cover. In 1954, the composer [[Alan Rawsthorne]] set six of the poems for speaker and orchestra in a work titled ''Practical Cats''. After Eliot's death, the book was adapted as the basis of the musical ''[[Cats (musical)|Cats]]'' by [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]], first produced in London's West End in 1981 and opening on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] the following year.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bl.uk/20th-century-literature/articles/an-introduction-to-old-possums-book-of-practical-cats|title=An introduction to Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats|website=The British Library|access-date=27 February 2018}}</ref>\n\n===''Four Quartets''===\n{{Main|Four Quartets}}\nEliot regarded ''Four Quartets'' as his masterpiece, and it is the work that led to his being awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]].<ref name=EB/> It consists of four long poems, each first published separately: ''[[Burnt Norton]]'' (1936), ''[[East Coker (poem)|East Coker]]'' (1940), ''[[The Dry Salvages]]'' (1941) and ''[[Little Gidding (poem)|Little Gidding]]'' (1942). Each has five sections. Although they resist easy characterisation, each poem includes meditations on the nature of time in some important respect\u2014[[theological]], historical, physical\u2014and its relation to the human condition. Each poem is associated with one of the four [[classical elements]], respectively: air, earth, water, and fire.\n\n''Burnt Norton'' is a meditative poem that begins with the narrator trying to focus on the present moment while walking through a garden, focusing on images and sounds like the bird, the roses, clouds, and an empty pool. The narrator's meditation leads him/her to reach \"the still point\" in which he doesn't try to get anywhere or to experience place and/or time, instead experiencing \"a grace of sense\". In the final section, the narrator contemplates the arts (\"Words\" and \"music\") as they relate to time. The narrator focuses particularly on the poet's art of manipulating \"Words [which] strain, / Crack and sometimes break, under the burden [of time], under the tension, slip, slide, perish, decay with imprecision, [and] will not stay in place, / Will not stay still.\" By comparison, the narrator concludes that \"Love is itself unmoving, / Only the cause and end of movement, / Timeless, and undesiring.\"\n\n''East Coker'' continues the examination of time and meaning, focusing in a famous passage on the nature of language and poetry. Out of darkness, Eliot offers a solution: \"I said to my soul, be still, and wait without hope.\"\n\n''The Dry Salvages'' treats the element of water, via images of river and sea. It strives to contain opposites: \"The past and future / Are conquered, and reconciled.\"\n\n''Little Gidding'' (the element of fire) is the most anthologised of the Quartets. Eliot's experiences as an air raid warden in [[the Blitz]] power the poem, and he imagines meeting [[Dante]] during the German bombing. The beginning of the Quartets (\"Houses / Are removed, destroyed\") had become a violent everyday experience; this creates an animation, where for the first time he talks of Love as the driving force behind all experience. From this background, the Quartets end with an affirmation of [[Julian of Norwich]]: \"All shall be well and / All manner of thing<!-- NOT \"things\" - Collected Poems, p.209 --> shall be well.\"\n\nThe ''Four Quartets'' cannot be understood without reference to Christian thought, traditions, and history. Eliot draws upon the theology, art, symbolism and language of such figures as Dante, and mystics [[St. John of the Cross]] and [[Julian of Norwich]]. The \"deeper communion\" sought in ''East Coker'', the \"hints and whispers of children, the sickness that must grow worse to find healing\", and the exploration which inevitably leads us home all point to the pilgrim's path along the road of [[sanctification]].{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\n==Plays==\n{{Main|Sweeney Agonistes|Murder in the Cathedral|The Rock (play)|The Family Reunion|The Cocktail Party|The Confidential Clerk|The Elder Statesman}}\nWith the important exception of ''Four Quartets'', Eliot directed much of his creative energies after ''Ash Wednesday'' to writing plays in verse, mostly comedies or plays with redemptive endings. He was long a critic and admirer of [[Elizabethan]] and [[Literature in English#Jacobean literature|Jacobean]] verse drama; witness his allusions to [[John Webster|Webster]], [[Thomas Middleton]], [[William Shakespeare]] and [[Thomas Kyd]] in ''The Waste Land''. In a 1933 lecture he said \"Every poet would like, I fancy, to be able to think that he had some direct social utility . . . . He would like to be something of a popular entertainer and be able to think his own thoughts behind a tragic or a comic mask. He would like to convey the pleasures of poetry, not only to a larger audience but to larger groups of people collectively; and the theatre is the best place in which to do it.\"<ref name=\"upuc\">Eliot, T. S. ''The Use of Poetry and the Use of Criticism'', Harvard University Press, 1933 (penultimate paragraph).</ref>\n\nAfter ''The Waste Land'' (1922), he wrote that he was \"now feeling toward a new form and style\". One project he had in mind was writing a play in verse, using some of the rhythms of early [[jazz]]. The play featured \"Sweeney\", a character who had appeared in a number of his poems. Although Eliot did not finish the play, he did publish two scenes from the piece. These scenes, titled ''Fragment of a Prologue'' (1926) and ''Fragment of an Agon'' (1927), were published together in 1932 as ''[[Sweeney Agonistes]]''. Although Eliot noted that this was not intended to be a one-act play, it is sometimes performed as one.<ref name=Gallup/>\n\nA pageant play by Eliot called ''The Rock'' was performed in 1934 for the benefit of churches in the [[Diocese of London]]. Much of it was a collaborative effort; Eliot accepted credit only for the authorship of one scene and the choruses.<ref name=Gallup/> [[George Bell (bishop)|George Bell]], the [[Bishop of Chichester]], had been instrumental in connecting Eliot with producer [[E. Martin Browne]] for the production of ''The Rock'', and later commissioned Eliot to write another play for the [[Canterbury Festival]] in 1935. This one, ''Murder in the Cathedral'', concerning the death of the martyr, [[Thomas Becket]], was more under Eliot's control. Eliot biographer [[Peter Ackroyd]] comments that \"for [Eliot], ''Murder in the Cathedral'' and succeeding verse plays offered a double advantage; it allowed him to practice poetry but it also offered a convenient home for his religious sensibility.\"<ref name=\"learner.org\"/> After this, he worked on more \"commercial\" plays for more general audiences: ''The Family Reunion'' (1939), ''The Cocktail Party'' (1949), ''The Confidential Clerk'', (1953) and ''The Elder Statesman'' (1958) (the latter three were produced by [[Henry Sherek]] and directed by [[E. Martin Browne]]<ref name=\"Darlington\">{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/36063|title=Henry Sherek|last=Darlington|first=W.

The Broadway production in New York of ''The Cocktail Party'' received the 1950 [[Tony Award]] for Best Play. Eliot wrote ''The Cocktail Party'' while he was a visiting scholar at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]].<ref>[https://www.ias.edu/files/pdfs/publications/letter-2007-spring.pdf T. S. Eliot at the Institute for Advanced Study], ''The Institute Letter'', Spring 2007, p. 6.</ref><ref>[http://www.ias.edu/people/cos/users/teliot01 Eliot, Thomas Stearns] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150119203650/https://www.ias.edu/people/cos/users/teliot01 |date=19 January 2015 }} IAS profile.</ref>\n\nRegarding his method of playwriting, Eliot explained, \"If I set out to write a play, I start by an act of choice. I settle upon a particular emotional situation, out of which characters and a plot will emerge. And then lines of poetry may come into being: not from the original impulse but from a secondary stimulation of the unconscious mind.\"<ref name=\"learner.org\"/>\n\n==Literary criticism==\nEliot also made significant contributions to the field of [[literary criticism]], strongly influencing the school of [[New Criticism]]. He was somewhat self-deprecating and minimising of his work and once said his criticism was merely a \"by-product\" of his \"private poetry-workshop\" But the critic [[William Empson]] once said, \"I do not know for certain how much of my own mind [Eliot] invented, let alone how much of it is a reaction against him or indeed a consequence of misreading him. He is a very penetrating influence, perhaps not unlike the east wind.\"<ref>quoted in Roger Kimball, \"A Craving for Reality\", ''The New Criterion'' Vol. 18, 1999.</ref>\n\nIn his critical essay \"[[Tradition and the Individual Talent]]\", Eliot argues that art must be understood not in a vacuum, but in the context of previous pieces of art. \"In a peculiar sense [an artist or poet] ... must inevitably be judged by the standards of the past.\"<ref name=bartleby1>{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/200/sw4.html |title=Tradition and the Individual Talent|author= Eliot, T. S. |work=The Sacred Wood |publisher=Bartleby.com |year=1930 |accessdate=3 August 2009}}</ref> This essay was an important influence over the New Criticism by introducing the idea that the value of a work of art must be viewed in the context of the artist's previous works, a \"simultaneous order\" of works (i.e., \"tradition\"). Eliot himself employed this concept on many of his works, especially on his long-poem ''The Waste Land''.<ref>[http://www.leidykla.vu.lt/fileadmin/Literatura/51_3/98-108.pdf Dirk Weidmann: ''And I Tiresias have foresuffered all...'']. In: ''LITERATURA'' 51 (3), 2009, pp. 98\u2013108.</ref>\n\nAlso important to New Criticism was the idea\u2014as articulated in Eliot's essay \"[[Hamlet and His Problems]]\"\u2014of an \"[[objective correlative]]\", which posits a connection among the words of the text and events, states of mind, and experiences.<ref name=Hamlet>{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/200/sw9.html |title=Hamlet and His Problems|author= Eliot, T. S. |work= The Sacred Wood |publisher=Bartleby.com |year=1921 |accessdate=3 August 2009}}</ref> This notion concedes that a poem means what it says, but suggests that there can be a non-subjective judgment based on different readers' different\u2014but perhaps corollary\u2014interpretations of a work.\n\nMore generally, New Critics took a cue from Eliot in regard to his \"'classical' ideals and his religious thought; his attention to the poetry and drama of the early seventeenth century; his deprecation of the Romantics, especially [[Shelley]]; his proposition that good poems constitute 'not a turning loose of emotion but an escape from emotion'; and his insistence that 'poets... at present must be difficult'.\"<ref>Burt, Steven and Lewin, Jennifer. \"Poetry and the New Criticism\". ''A Companion to Twentieth-Century Poetry'', Neil Roberts, ed. Malden, Massachusetts: Blackwell Publishers, 2001. p. 154</ref>\n\nEliot's essays were a major factor in the revival of interest in the [[metaphysical poets]]. Eliot particularly praised the metaphysical poets' ability to show experience as both psychological and sensual, while at the same time infusing this portrayal with\u2014in Eliot's view\u2014wit and uniqueness. Eliot's essay \"The Metaphysical Poets\", along with giving new significance and attention to metaphysical poetry, introduced his now well-known definition of \"unified sensibility\", which is considered by some to mean the same thing as the term \"metaphysical\".<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/journal_of_modern_literature/v027/27.1baker.html |title=Project MUSE |publisher=Muse.jhu.edu |accessdate=3 August 2009|doi=10.1353/jml.2004.0051 }}</ref><ref>A.

Malloch, \"The Unified Sensibility and Metaphysical Poetry\", ''College English'', Vol. 15, No. 2 (Nov. 1953), pp. 95\u2013101</ref>\n\nHis 1922 poem ''The Waste Land''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/201/1.html |author=Eliot, T. S. |title=The Waste Land|publisher=Bartleby.com |year= 1922|accessdate=3 August 2009}}</ref> also can be better understood in light of his work as a critic. He had argued that a poet must write \"programmatic criticism\", that is, a poet should write to advance his own interests rather than to advance \"historical scholarship\". Viewed from Eliot's critical lens, ''The Waste Land'' likely shows his personal despair about [[World War I]] rather than an objective historical understanding of it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-2088/TS-Eliot |title=T.

Alfred Prufrock\", \"Portrait of a Lady\", \"La Figlia Che Piange\", \"Preludes\", and \"Rhapsody on a Windy Night\" had \"[an] effect [that] was both unique and compelling, and their assurance staggered [Eliot's] contemporaries who were privileged to read them in manuscript. [Conrad] Aiken, for example, marveled at 'how sharp and complete and [[sui generis]] the whole thing was, from the outset. The wholeness is there, from the very beginning.'\"<ref name=\"english.illinois.edu\" />\n\nThe initial critical response to Eliot's ''The Waste Land'' was mixed. Bush notes that the piece was at first correctly perceived as a work of jazz-like syncopation\u2014and, like 1920s [[jazz]], essentially iconoclastic.\"<ref name=\"english.illinois.edu\"/> Some critics, like [[Edmund Wilson]], [[Conrad Aiken]], and [[Gilbert Seldes]] thought it was the best poetry being written in the English language while others thought it was esoteric and wilfully difficult. Edmund Wilson, being one of the critics who praised Eliot, called him \"one of our only authentic poets\".<ref name=\"Wilson, Edmund 1922\">Wilson, Edmund, \"The Poetry of Drouth\". ''The Dial'' 73. December 1922. 611\u201316.</ref> Wilson also pointed out some of Eliot's weaknesses as a poet. In regard to ''The Waste Land'', Wilson admits its flaws (\"its lack of structural unity\"), but concluded, \"I doubt whether there is a single other poem of equal length by a contemporary American which displays so high and so varied a mastery of English verse.\"<ref name=\"Wilson, Edmund 1922\"/>\n\nCharles Powell was negative in his criticism of Eliot, calling his poems incomprehensible.<ref>Powell, Charles, \"So Much Waste Paper\". ''Manchester Guardian'', 31 October 1923.</ref> And the writers of ''Time'' magazine were similarly baffled by a challenging poem like ''The Waste Land''.<ref>''Time'', 3 March 1923, 12.</ref> [[John Crowe Ransom]] wrote negative criticisms of Eliot's work but also had positive things to say. For instance, though Ransom negatively criticised ''The Waste Land'' for its \"extreme disconnection\", Ransom was not completely condemnatory of Eliot's work and admitted that Eliot was a talented poet.<ref>Ransom, John Crowe. \"Waste Lands\". ''New York Evening Post Literary Review'', 14 July 1923, pp. 825\u201326.</ref>\n\nAddressing some of the common criticisms directed against ''The Waste Land'' at the time, Gilbert Seldes stated, \"It seems at first sight remarkably disconnected and confused... [however] a closer view of the poem does more than illuminate the difficulties; it reveals the hidden form of the work, [and] indicates how each thing falls into place.\"<ref>Seldes, Gilbert. \"T. S. Eliot\". ''Nation'', 6 December 1922. 614\u2013616.</ref>\n\nEliot's reputation as a poet, as well as his influence in the academy, peaked following the publication of ''The Four Quartets''. In an essay on Eliot published in 1989, the writer [[Cynthia Ozick]] refers to this peak of influence (from the 1940s through the early 1960s) as \"the Age of Eliot\" when Eliot \"seemed pure zenith, a colossus, nothing less than a permanent luminary, fixed in the firmament like the sun and the moon\".<ref>{{cite web|first=Cynthia |last=Ozick| url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1989/11/20/t-s-eliot-at-101|title=T.S. ELIOT AT 101|work=The New Yorker|date=20 November 1989|accessdate=1 December 2016}}</ref> But during this post-war period, others, like Ronald Bush, observed that this time also marked the beginning of the decline in Eliot's literary influence: <blockquote>As Eliot's conservative religious and political convictions began to seem less congenial in the postwar world, other readers reacted with suspicion to his assertions of authority, obvious in ''Four Quartets'' and implicit in the earlier poetry. The result, fueled by intermittent rediscovery of Eliot's occasional anti-Semitic rhetoric, has been a progressive downward revision of his once towering reputation.<ref name=\"english.illinois.edu\"/></blockquote> Bush also notes that Eliot's reputation \"slipped\" significantly further after his death. He writes, \"Sometimes regarded as too academic ([[William Carlos Williams]]'s view), Eliot was also frequently criticized for a deadening [[neoclassicism]] (as he himself\u2014perhaps just as unfairly\u2014had criticized [[John Milton|Milton]]). However, the multifarious tributes from practicing poets of many schools published during his centenary in 1988 was a strong indication of the intimidating continued presence of his poetic voice.\"<ref name=\"english.illinois.edu\"/>\n\nAlthough Eliot's poetry is not as influential as it once was, notable literary scholars, like [[Harold Bloom]]<ref>Bloom, Harold. ''The Western Canon: Books and Schools of the Ages''. NY: Riverhead, 1995.</ref> and [[Stephen Greenblatt]],<ref name=Norton>Stephen Greenblatt, et al. (eds), ''The Norton Anthology of English Literature, Volume 2''. \"T.S. Eliot\". New York, NY: W.W. Norton & Co.: NY, NY, 2000.</ref> still acknowledge that Eliot's poetry is central to the literary English canon. For instance, the editors of ''The Norton Anthology of English Literature'' write, \"There is no disagreement on [Eliot's] importance as one of the great renovators of the English poetry dialect, whose influence on a whole generation of poets, critics, and intellectuals generally was enormous. [However] his range as a poet [was] limited, and his interest in the great middle ground of human experience (as distinct from the extremes of saint and sinner) [was] deficient.\" Despite this criticism, these scholars also acknowledge \"[Eliot's] poetic cunning, his fine craftsmanship, his original accent, his historical and representative importance as ''the'' poet of the modern [[Symbolism (arts)|symbolist]]-[[Metaphysical poets|Metaphysical]] tradition\".<ref name=Norton />\n\n===Anti-Semitism===\nThe depiction of Jews in some of Eliot's poems has led several critics to accuse him of [[anti-Semitism]]. This case has been presented most forcefully in a study by [[Anthony Julius]]: ''T. S. Eliot, Anti-Semitism, and Literary Form'' (1996).<ref>[[John Gross|Gross, John]].

Eliot's well-earned reputation [as a poet] is established beyond all doubt, and making him out to be as unflawed as the [[Gabriel|Archangel Gabriel]] does him no favours.\"<ref>Eagleton, Terry.

His work, in particular ''[[The Waste Land]]'', ''[[The Hollow Men]]'', and ''[[Ash Wednesday (poem)|Ash Wednesday]]'' strongly influenced the poetry of two of the most significant post-[[World War II|War]] [[Irish language]] poets, [[Se\u00e1n \u00d3 R\u00edord\u00e1in]] and [[M\u00e1irt\u00edn \u00d3 D\u00edre\u00e1in]]. Eliot was an influence on \u00d3 R\u00edord\u00e1in's later work although the Irish poet's relation to modernity, and more particularly to modernisation, was uncomfortable from the outset.<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Dorgan|first1=Theo|author-link1=Theo Dorgan|url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/irish-poetry-since-kavanagh/oclc/35305248|title=Irish poetry since Kavanagh|date=1995|page=44|publisher=[[Four Courts Press]]|isbn=978-1-85182-239-3|location=Blackrock, Co.

In large part unionists, at least in the north-east, supported its creation while nationalists were opposed.<!--Northern Ireland today remains a divided society with a legacy of civil conflict, at times made obvious through territorial markings such as painted kerbstones and the flying of the British or Irish national flags.-->\n\n==Resistance to Home Rule==\nFrom the late 19th century, the majority of people living in Ireland wanted the [[Her Majesty's Government|British government]] to grant some form of self-rule to Ireland. The [[Irish Nationalist Party]] sometimes held the balance of power in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, a position from which it sought to gain [[Home Rule]], which would have given Ireland autonomy in internal affairs, without breaking up the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]]. Two bills granting [[Home Rule]] to Ireland were passed by the House of Commons in 1886 and 1893, but rejected by the [[House of Lords]]. With the passing of the [[Parliament Act 1911]] by the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] government (which reduced the powers of the Lords from striking down parliamentary Bills to delaying their implementation for two years) it was apparent that Home Rule would probably come into force in the next five years. The [[Home Rule League|Home Rule Party]] had been campaigning for this for almost fifty years.\n\nHowever, a significant minority was vehemently opposed to the idea and wished to retain the [[Act of Union 1800|Union]] in its existing form. [[Irish unionists]] had been agitating successfully against Home Rule since the 1880s, and on 28 September 1912, the leader of the northern unionists, [[Edward Carson, Baron Carson|Edward Carson]], introduced the [[Ulster Covenant]] in [[Belfast]], pledging to exclude [[Ulster]] from home rule. The Covenant was signed by 450,000 men. Whilst precipitating a split with unionists in the south and west (including a particularly sizeable community in [[Dublin]]), it gave the northern unionists a feasible goal to aim for.\n\nBy the early 20th century, [[Belfast]], the largest city in Ulster, had become the largest city in Ireland. Its industrial economy, with strong engineering and shipbuilding sectors, was closely integrated with that of Great Britain. Belfast was a substantially [[Ulster Protestant]] town with a [[Catholic]] minority of less than 30 per cent, concentrated in the west of the city.\n\nA third [[Home Rule Act 1914|Home Rule Bill]] was introduced by the Liberal minority government in 1912. However, the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] was sympathetic to the unionist case, and the political voice of unionism was strong in Parliament. After heavy amendment by the House of Lords, the Commons agreed in 1914 to allow four counties of Ulster to vote themselves out of its provisions and then only for six years. Throughout 1913 and 1914, paramilitary \"volunteer armies\" were recruited and armed, firstly the unionist [[Ulster Volunteer Force (1912)|Ulster Volunteer Force]] (UVF), and in response, the nationalist [[Irish Volunteers]]. But events in [[World War I]] Europe were to take precedence. Home rule was delayed for the duration of what was expected to be a short war and unionist and nationalist leaders agreed to encourage their volunteers to join the [[British army]].\n\n==1916: Easter Rising, Battle of the Somme and aftermath==\nDuring [[World War I]], tensions continued to mount in Ireland. Hardline Irish separatists (known at the time as ''Irish Nationalists'' and later as ''Republicans'') rejected Home Rule entirely because it involved maintaining the connection with Britain. They retained control of one faction of the [[Irish Volunteers]], and in Easter 1916, led by [[Thomas Clarke (Irish republican)|Thomas Clarke]], [[James Connolly]] and others [[Easter Rising|attempted a rebellion in Dublin]]. After summary trials, the British government had the leaders executed for treason. The government [[History of Sinn F\u00e9in#Dual monarchy: 1905 to 1917|blamed the small Sinn F\u00e9in]] party, which had had little to do with it. The execution of the leaders of the rebellion turned out to be a propaganda coup for militant republicanism, and [[Sinn F\u00e9in]]'s previously negligible popular support grew. The surviving leaders of the Irish Volunteers infiltrated the party and assumed its leadership in 1917. (The Irish Volunteers would later become the [[Irish Republican Army]] (IRA) in 1919.) Republicans gained further support when the British government [[Conscription Crisis of 1918|attempted to introduce conscription to Ireland in 1918]]. Sinn F\u00e9in was at the forefront of organising the campaign against [[conscription]].\n\nThe [[36th (Ulster) Division]] was one of the first units in the British Army to be sent into the [[Battle of the Somme|Somme]] beginning in July 1916. Despite being one of the few divisions to achieve their objectives, the Ulstermen suffered nearly 85% casualties. Though the 36th Division was made up of both Catholics and Protestants from the north, one result from the heavy losses at the Somme was that the Unionist community became evermore determined to remain in the United Kingdom, believing themselves to have sacrificed theirs sons at the behest of the Crown. Nationalists joined in great numbers as well, with \"old\" Irish regiments from [[Munster]] and [[Leinster]] being greatly strengthened by these recruits. When the veterans of World War I, on both sides of the political divide, returned from the front in 1918 and 1919, they came back as battle-hardened soldiers. In the [[1918 Irish general election|general election of 1918]], the [[Irish Parliamentary Party]] lost almost all of its seats to Sinn F\u00e9in. Of the 30 seats in the six counties that would become Northern Ireland, 23 were won by Unionists, including 3 [[Labour Unionists]] and five of the six IPP members returned in Ireland were elected in Ulster as a result of local voting pacts with Sinn F\u00e9in.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ark.ac.uk/elections/h1918.htm |title=The Irish Election of 1918 |date=25 March 2006 |author=Nicholas Whyte |publisher=ARK |accessdate=25 October 2012 }}</ref>\n\n[[Guerrilla warfare]] gathered pace in Ireland in the aftermath of the election, leading to the [[Anglo-Irish War]]. Although lower in intensity in Ulster than the rest of Ireland, the conflict was complicated there by involving not only the IRA, [[British Army]] and [[Royal Irish Constabulary]], but the [[Ulster Volunteer Force (1912)|Ulster Volunteer Force]] (UVF) as well.\n\n==Partition==\n[[File:IrelandUlster.svg|right|thumb| Map of Ireland. The counties are indicated by thin black lines, including those in [[Ulster]] in green, and the modern territory of [[Northern Ireland]] indicated by a heavy black border across the island that separates six of the Ulster counties from the other three.]]\n{{Main|Partition of Ireland}}\nThe fourth and final Home Rule Bill (the [[Government of Ireland Act 1920]]) [[Partition of Ireland|partitioned]] the island into ''Northern Ireland'' (six northeastern counties) and ''[[Southern Ireland (1921\u201322)|Southern Ireland]]'' (the rest of the island). Some unionists such as Sir [[Edward Carson]] opposed partition, seeing it as a betrayal of unionism as a pan-Irish political movement. Three Counties unionists (those living in the Ulster counties of [[County Cavan|Cavan]], [[County Donegal|Donegal]], and [[County Monaghan|Monaghan]]) who found themselves on the wrong side of the new border that partitioned [[Ulster]], felt betrayed by those who had joined them in pledging to \"stand by one another\" in the [[Ulster Covenant]].<ref>http://www.historyireland.com/20th-century-contemporary-history/the-emergence-of-the-two-irelands-1912-25/</ref> The ''[[Belfast Telegraph]]'' reassured unionists who felt guilty about this \"that it was better for two-thirds of passengers to save themselves than for all to drown\".<ref>http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/issues/sectarian/brewer.htm</ref> Many Irish nationalists also opposed partition, although some were gratified that Northern Ireland contained a large nationalist minority that would deny it stability.\n\nThe Treaty was given effect in the United Kingdom through the [[Irish Free State Constitution Act 1922]]. Under Article 12 of the Treaty, Northern Ireland could exercise its ''opt out'' by presenting an address to the [[George V of the United Kingdom|King]] requesting not to be part of the Irish Free State. Once the Treaty was ratified, the [[Parliament of Northern Ireland]] had one month to exercise this ''opt out'' during which month the Irish Free State Government could not legislate for Northern Ireland, holding the Free State's effective jurisdiction in abeyance for a month.\n\nOn 7 December 1922 (the day after the establishment of the Irish Free State) the Parliament of Northern Ireland resolved to make the following address to the King so as to ''opt out'' of the Irish Free State:<ref>{{cite news |work=ahds.ac.uk |url=http://stormontpapers.ahds.ac.uk/stormontpapers/pageview.html?volumeno=2&pageno=1145#bak-2-1149 |title=Northern Ireland Parliamentary Report |date=7 December 1922 |pages=1147 and 1150 |publisher=Stormont Papers}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|MOST GRACIOUS SOVEREIGN, We, your Majesty's most dutiful and loyal subjects, the Senators and Commons of Northern Ireland in Parliament assembled, having learnt of the passing of the Irish Free State Constitution Act, 1922, being the Act of Parliament for the ratification of the Articles of Agreement for a Treaty between Great Britain and Ireland, do, by this humble Address, pray your Majesty that the powers of the Parliament and Government of the Irish Free State shall no longer extend to Northern Ireland.}}\n\nOn 13 December 1922 Prime Minister [[James Craig, 1st Viscount Craigavon|James Craig]] addressed the Parliament of Northern Ireland informing them that the King had responded to the Parliament's address as follows:<ref>{{cite news |publisher=Stormont Papers |work=ahds.ac.uk |url=http://stormontpapers.ahds.ac.uk/stormontpapers/pageview.html?volumeno=2&pageno=1145#fwd-2-1189 |title=Northern Ireland Parliamentary Report |date=13 December 1922 |volume=2 |pages=1191\u20131192}}</ref>\n\n{{cquote|I have received the Address presented to me by both Houses of the Parliament of Northern Ireland in pursuance of Article 12 of the Articles of Agreement set forth in the Schedule to the Irish Free State (Agreement) Act, 1922, and of Section 5 of the Irish Free State Constitution Act, 1922, and I have caused my Ministers and the Irish Free State Government to be so informed.}}\n\n==Early years of Home Rule==\nNorthern Ireland, having received [[self-government]] within the United Kingdom under the Government of Ireland Act, was in some respects left to its own devices.\n\nThe first years of the new autonomous region were marked by bitter violence, particularly in [[Belfast]]. The IRA was determined to oppose the partition of Ireland so the authorities created the (mainly ex-UVF) [[Ulster Special Constabulary]] to aid the [[Royal Irish Constabulary]] (RIC) and introduced emergency powers to combat the IRA. Many died in political violence between 1920 and 1923, during which Belfast experienced the worst violence in its history. Killings petered out in 1923 after the signing of the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]] in 1922.\n\n{{cquote|In total, 636 people were killed between July 1920 and July 1922 in Northern Ireland. Approximately 460 of these deaths occurred in Belfast (258 Catholics, 159 Protestants, and 3 of unknown religion). However, as Catholics made up less than one-quarter of the population of the city, the per capita death rates were much higher.<ref>Lynch, Robert, \"The People's Protectors? The Irish Republican Army and the \u201cBelfast Pogrom,\u201d 1920\u20131922\", ''Journal of British Studies'' Volume 47, Issue 2 April 2008 , pp. 375-391, fn. 9 [https://doi.org/10.1086/526757]</ref>}}\n\nThe continuing violence created a climate of fear in the new region, and there was migration across the new border. As well as movement of Protestants from the Free State into Northern Ireland, some Catholics fled south, leaving some of those who remained feeling isolated. Despite the mixed religious affiliation of the old [[Royal Irish Constabulary]] and the transfer of many Catholic RIC police officers to the newly formed [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]] (1922), northern Catholics did not join the new force in great numbers. Many nationalists came to view the new police force as sectarian, adding to their sense of alienation from the state.\n\n==1925\u20131965==\nUnder successive unionist [[Prime Minister of Northern Ireland|Prime Ministers]] from [[Sir James Craig]] (later Lord Craigavon) onwards, the unionist establishment practised what is generally considered a policy of discrimination against the nationalist/Catholic minority.\n\nThis pattern was firmly established in the case of local government,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/issues/discrimination/whyte.htm |title='How much discrimination was there under the Unionist regime, 1921\u20131968?' by John Whyte |date=14 January 2012 |author=Fionnuala McKenna |publisher=ARK |accessdate=25 October 2012 }}</ref> where [[gerrymandering|gerrymandered]] ward boundaries rigged local government elections to ensure unionist control of some local councils with nationalist majorities.

Emigration to seek employment was significantly more prevalent among the Catholic population. As a result, Northern Ireland's demography shifted further in favour of Protestants, leaving their ascendancy seemingly impregnable by the late 1950s.\n\nThe abolition of [[proportional representation]] in 1929 meant that the structure of party politics gave the [[Ulster Unionist Party]] a continual sizeable majority in the [[Parliament of Northern Ireland]], leading to fifty years of [[one-party rule]]. While nationalist parties continued to retain the same number of seats that they had under proportional representation, the [[Northern Ireland Labour Party]] and various smaller leftist unionist groups were smothered, meaning that it proved impossible for any group to sustain a challenge to the Ulster Unionist Party from within the unionist section of the population.\n\nIn 1935, the worst violence since partition convulsed [[Belfast]]. After an [[Orange Institution|Orange Order]] parade decided to return to the city centre through a Catholic area instead of its usual route; the resulting violence left nine people dead.

It found little support among nationalists. However, many Catholics were resentful towards the state, and nationalist politics was fatalist. Meanwhile, the period saw an almost complete synthesis between the Ulster Unionist Party and the [[Ulster loyalism|loyalist]] [[Orange Institution|Orange Order]], with Catholics (even unionist Catholics) being excluded from any position of political or civil authority outside of a handful of nationalist-controlled councils.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tcbh.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/11/3/284.pdf |title=Assimilation versus Segregation: Unionist Strategy in the 1960s |year=2000 |author=MARC MULHOLLAND |publisher=Twentieth Century Brit Hist |accessdate=25 October 2012 }}</ref>\n\nThroughout this time, although the Catholic birth rate remained higher than for Protestants, the Catholic proportion of the population declined, as poor economic prospects, especially west of the [[River Bann]], saw Catholics emigrate in disproportionate numbers.\n\nNationalist political institutions declined, with the Nationalist Party boycotting the Stormont Parliament for much of this period and its constituency organisations reducing to little more than shells. [[Sinn F\u00e9in]] was banned although it often operated through the [[Republican Clubs]] or similar vehicles.

The unemployment that had been so persistent in the 1930s disappeared, and labour shortages appeared. There was a major munitions strike in 1944.<ref>Boyd Black, \"A Triumph of Voluntarism? Industrial Relations and Strikes in Northern Ireland in World War Two,\" ''Labour History Review'' (2005) 70#1 pp 5\u201325</ref> As a key industrial city, Belfast became a target for German bombing missions, but it was thinly defended; there were only 24 anti-aircraft guns in the city. The Northern Ireland government under [[Richard Dawson Bates]] (Minister for Home Affairs) had prepared too late, assuming that Belfast was far enough away to be safe. When Germany conquered France in Spring 1940 it gained closer airfields. The city's fire brigade was inadequate, there were no public air raid shelters as the Northern Ireland government was reluctant to spend money on them, and there were no searchlights in the city, which made shooting down enemy bombers all the more difficult. After the Blitz in London during the autumn of 1940, the government began to build air raid shelters. In early 1941, the Luftwaffe flew reconnaissance missions that identified the docks and industrial areas to be targeted. Working class areas in the north and east of the city were particularly hard hit, as over 1,000 people were killed and hundreds were seriously injured. Many people left the city in fear of future attacks. The bombing revealed terrible slum conditions in the city. In May 1941, the Luftwaffe hit the docks and the [[Harland and Wolff]] shipyard, closing it for six months. The [[Belfast blitz]] saw half of the city's houses destroyed. About \u00a320 million worth of damage was caused. The Northern Ireland government was criticised heavily for its lack of preparation, and Northern Ireland's Prime Minister [[J. M. Andrews]] resigned. The bombing raids continued until the invasion of Russia in summer 1941. The American army arrived in 1942\u201344, setting up bases around Northern Ireland.\n\n==The Troubles==\n{{Main|The Troubles}}\n[[File:History is written by the winner.jpg|thumb|History is written by the winner.

The increasing pressures from Irish nationalists for reform and opposition by Ulster loyalists to compromise led to the appearance of the [[Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association]], under figures such as [[Austin Currie]] and [[John Hume]]. It had some moderate Protestant support and membership, and a considerable dose of student radicalism after Northern Ireland was swept up in the worldwide [[protests of 1968]]. Clashes between marchers and the RUC led to increased communal strife, culminating in an attack by a unionist mob (which included [[Ulster Special Constabulary|police reservists]]) on a march, known as the [[Burntollet bridge incident]], outside [[Derry]] on 4 January 1969. Wholescale violence erupted after an [[Apprentice Boys]] march was forced through the Irish nationalist [[Bogside]] area of Derry on 12 August 1969 by the RUC, which led to large-scale disorder known as the [[Battle of the Bogside]]. Rioting continued until 14 August, and in that time 1,091 canisters, each containing 12.5g of [[CS gas]] and 14 canisters containing 50g, were released by the RUC. Even more severe rioting broke out in Belfast and elsewhere in response to events in Derry (see [[Northern Ireland riots of August 1969]]). The following thirty years of civil strife came to be known as \"the Troubles\".\n\nAt the request of the unionist-controlled Northern Ireland government, the [[British army]] was deployed by the UK [[Home Secretary]] [[James Callaghan]] two days later on 14 August 1969. Two weeks later, control of security in Northern Ireland was passed from the Stormont government to Lieutenant-General [[Ian Freeland]] ([[General Officer Commanding|GOC]]). At first the soldiers received a warm welcome from Irish nationalists, who hoped they would protect them from loyalist attack (which the [[Irish Republican Army (1922\u201369)|IRA]] had, for [[Official IRA#Reasons behind the split|ideological reasons]], not done effectively).{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} However, tensions rose throughout the following years, with an important milestone in the worsening relationship between the British Army and Irish nationalists being the [[Falls Curfew]] of 3 July 1970, when 3,000 British troops imposed a three-day curfew on the Lower Falls area of West Belfast.\n\nAfter the introduction of [[Operation Demetrius|internment]] without trial for suspected IRA men on 9 August 1971, even the most moderate Irish nationalists reacted by completely withdrawing their co-operation with the state. The [[Social Democratic and Labour Party]] (SDLP) members of the [[Parliament of Northern Ireland]] withdrew from that body on 15 August and a widespread campaign of [[civil disobedience]] began.\n\n===1972\u20131974===\nTensions were ratcheted to a higher level after the killing of fourteen unarmed civilians in Derry by the [[1st Battalion, Parachute Regiment]] on 30 January 1972, an event dubbed [[Bloody Sunday (1972)|Bloody Sunday]].\nMany civilians were killed and injured by the indiscriminate bombing campaigns carried out, mainly by the Provisional IRA.\nThroughout this period, the main paramilitary organisations began to form. 1972 was the most violent year of the conflict. In 1970 the [[Provisional IRA]], was created as a breakaway from what then became known as the [[Official IRA]] (the Provisionals came from various political perspectives, though most rejected the increasingly [[Marxist]] outlook of the Officials and were united in their rejection of the Official's view that physical force alone would not end partition), and a campaign of sectarian attacks by loyalist paramilitary groups like the [[Ulster Defence Association]] (formed to co-ordinate the various Loyalist vigilante groups that sprung up) and others brought Northern Ireland to the brink of civil war. On 30 March 1972, the British government, unwilling to grant the unionist Northern Ireland government more authoritarian special powers, and now convinced of its inability to restore order, pushed through emergency legislation that prorogued the Northern Ireland Parliament and introduced [[Direct rule over Northern Ireland|direct rule]] from London.<ref>[[Northern Ireland (Temporary Provisions) Act 1972]] (c. 22)</ref> In 1973 the [[British government]] dissolved the [[Parliament of Northern Ireland]] and its government under the [[Northern Ireland Constitution Act 1973]].\n\nThe British government held talks with various parties, including the Provisional IRA, during 1972 and 1973. The Official IRA declared a ceasefire in 1972, and eventually ended violence against the British altogether, although a breakaway group, the [[Irish National Liberation Army]], continued. The Provisional IRA remained the largest and most effective nationalist paramilitary group.\n\nOn 9 December 1973, after talks in [[Sunningdale]], Berkshire, the UUP, SDLP and [[Alliance Party of Northern Ireland]] and both governments reached the [[Sunningdale Agreement]] on a cross-community government for Northern Ireland, which took office on 1 January 1974. The Provisional IRA was unimpressed{{Why|date=April 2020}}, increasing the tempo of its campaign, while many unionists were outraged at the participation of Irish nationalists in the government of Northern Ireland and at the cross-border [[Council of Ireland]]. Although the pro-Sunningdale parties had a clear majority in the new [[Northern Ireland Assembly, 1973|Northern Ireland Assembly]], the failure of the pro-Agreement parties to co-ordinate their efforts in the general election of 28 February, combined with an IRA-sponsored boycott by hardline republicans, allowed anti-Sunningdale unionists to take 51.1% of the vote and 11 of Northern Ireland's 12 seats in the UK House of Commons.\n\nEmboldened by this, a coalition of anti-Agreement unionist politicians and paramilitaries organised the [[Ulster Workers' Council strike]] which began on 15 May. The strikers brought Northern Ireland to a standstill by shutting down power stations, and after Prime Minister [[Harold Wilson]] refused to send in troops to take over from the strikers, the power-sharing executive collapsed on 28 May 1974.\n\nSome British politicians, notably former British [[The Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] minister [[Tony Benn]], advocated British withdrawal from Ireland, but many opposed this policy, and called their prediction of the possible results of British withdrawal the 'Doomsday Scenario', anticipating widespread communal strife. The worst fear envisaged a civil war which would engulf not just Northern Ireland, but also the Republic of Ireland and [[Scotland]], both of which had major links with the [[people of Northern Ireland]]. Later, the feared possible impact of British withdrawal was the '[[Balkanisation]]' of Northern Ireland.\n\nThe level of violence declined from 1972 onwards, decreasing to under 150 deaths a year after 1976 and under 100 after 1988.<ref>http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/sutton/book/</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/ni/security.htm#04 |title=Background Information on Northern Ireland Society \u2013 Security and Defence |date= 17 January 2012 |publisher=ARK |accessdate=25 October 2012 }}</ref> The Provisional IRA, using weapons and explosives obtained from the United States and [[Libya]], bombed England and various British army bases in Europe, as well as conducting ongoing attacks within Northern Ireland. These attacks were not only on \"military\" targets but also on commercial properties and various city centres. Arguably its signature attack would involve cars packed with high explosives. At the same time, loyalist paramilitaries largely (but not exclusively) focused their campaign within Northern Ireland, ignoring the uninvolved military of the [[Republic of Ireland]], and instead claiming a (very) few republican paramilitary casualties. They usually<ref>http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/cgi-bin/tab2.pl</ref> targeted Catholics (especially those working in Protestant areas), and attacked Catholic-frequented pubs using automatic fire weapons. Such attacks were euphemistically known as \"spray jobs\". Both groups would also carry out extensive \"punishment\" attacks against members of their own communities for a variety of perceived, alleged, or suspected crimes.\n\n===1975\u20131998===\nVarious fitful political talks took place from then until the early 1990s, backed by schemes such as [[rolling devolution]], and 1975 saw a brief Provisional IRA ceasefire. The two events of real significance during this period, however, were the [[1981 Irish Hunger Strike|hunger strikes]] (1981) and the [[Anglo-Irish Agreement]] (1985).\n\nDespite the failure of the hunger strike, the modern republican movement made its first foray into electoral politics, with modest electoral success on both sides of the border, including the election of [[Bobby Sands]] to the House of Commons. This convinced republicans to adopt the [[Armalite and ballot box strategy]] and gradually take a more political approach.\n\nWhile the Anglo-Irish Agreement failed to bring an end to political violence in Northern Ireland, it did improve co-operation between the British and Irish governments, which was key to the creation of the [[Belfast Agreement]] a decade later.\n\nAt a strategic level the agreement demonstrated that the British recognised as legitimate the wishes of the Republic to have a direct interest in the affairs of Northern Ireland. It also demonstrated to paramilitaries that their refusal to negotiate with the governments might be self-defeating in the long run. Unlike the Sunningdale Agreement, the Anglo-Irish Agreement withstood a much more concerted campaign of violence and intimidation, as well as political hostility, from unionists. Republicans were left in the position of rejecting the only significant all-Ireland structures created since partition.\n\nBy the 1990s, the perceived stalemate between the IRA and British security forces, along with the increasing political successes of Sinn F\u00e9in, convinced a majority inside the republican movement that greater progress towards republican objectives might be achieved through negotiation rather than violence at this stage.<ref>{{cite book |authorlink=Peter Taylor (journalist) |last=Taylor |first=Peter |year=1999 |title=Behind the mask: The IRA and Sinn F\u00e9in |chapter=21: ''Stalemate'' |pages=246\u2013261 |isbn=1-57500-077-6}}</ref> This change from paramilitary to political means was part of a broader [[Northern Ireland peace process]], which followed the appearance of new leaders in London ([[John Major]]) and [[Dublin]] ([[Albert Reynolds]]).\n\n==New government structure ==\n\n===The Belfast Agreement===\n{{main|Belfast Agreement|Northern Ireland peace process}}\n[[File:Northern Ireland election seats 1997-2019.svg|thumb|General election results 1997 to present. In general, the [[Ulster Unionist Party]] and [[SDLP]] have lost support, while [[Sinn F\u00e9in]], the [[Democratic Unionist Party]] and [[Alliance Party of Northern Ireland|Alliance]] have risen.]]\n\nIncreased government focus on the problems of Northern Ireland led, in 1993, to the two prime ministers signing the [[Downing Street Declaration]]. At the same time [[Gerry Adams]], leader of [[Sinn F\u00e9in]], and [[John Hume]], leader of the [[Social Democratic and Labour Party]], engaged in talks. The UK political landscape changed dramatically when the 1997 general election saw the return of a Labour government, led by prime minister [[Tony Blair]], with a large parliamentary majority. A new leader of the [[Ulster Unionist Party]], [[David Trimble]], initially perceived as a hardliner, brought his party into the all-party negotiations which in 1998 produced the [[Belfast Agreement]] (\"Good Friday Agreement\"), signed by eight parties on 10 April 1998, although not involving [[Ian Paisley]]'s [[Democratic Unionist Party]] or the [[UK Unionist Party]]. A majority of both communities in Northern Ireland approved this Agreement, as did the people of the [[Republic of Ireland]], both by [[referendum]] on 22 May 1998. The Republic amended [[Constitution of Ireland|its constitution]], to replace a claim it made to the territory of Northern Ireland with an affirmation of the right of all the people of Ireland to be part of the Irish nation and a declaration of an aspiration towards a [[United Ireland]] (see the [[Nineteenth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland]]).\n\nUnder the Good Friday Agreement, properly known as the [[Belfast Agreement]], voters elected a new [[Northern Ireland Assembly]] to form a parliament. Every party that reaches a specific level of support gains the right to name members of its party to government and claim one or more ministries. [[Ulster Unionist]] party leader [[David Trimble]] became [[First Minister of Northern Ireland]]. The Deputy Leader of the SDLP, [[Seamus Mallon]], became [[Deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland]], though his party's new leader, [[Mark Durkan]], subsequently replaced him. The [[Ulster Unionist]]s, [[Social Democratic and Labour Party]], [[Sinn F\u00e9in]] and the [[Democratic Unionist Party]] each had ministers by right in the power-sharing assembly.\n\nThe Assembly and its Executive operated on a stop-start basis, with repeated disagreements about whether the IRA was fulfilling its commitments to disarm, and also allegations from the [[Police Service of Northern Ireland]]'s [[Special Branch]] that there was an IRA spy-ring operating in the heart of the civil service. It has since emerged that the spy-ring was run by [[MI5]] (see [[Denis Donaldson]]). Northern Ireland was then, once more, run by the [[Direct rule over Northern Ireland|Direct Rule]] [[Secretary of State for Northern Ireland]], [[Peter Hain]], and a British ministerial team answerable to him. Hain was answerable only to the Cabinet.\n\nThe changing British position to Northern Ireland was represented by the visit of Queen [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Elizabeth II]] to Stormont, where she met nationalist ministers from the SDLP as well as unionist ministers and spoke of the right of people who perceive themselves as Irish to be treated as equal citizens along with those who regard themselves as British. Similarly, on visits to Northern Ireland, the [[President of Ireland]], [[Mary McAleese]], met with unionist ministers and with the [[Lord Lieutenant]] of each county \u2013 the official representatives of the Queen.\n\nDissident Republicans in the Provisional IRA who refused to recognize the Good Friday Agreement split from the main body and formed a separate entity known as the [[Real IRA]]. It was this paramilitary group that was responsible for the [[Omagh Bombing]] in August 1998 that claimed the lives of 29 including a mother and her unborn twins. In a break from traditional Republican policy, [[Martin McGuinness]] officially condemned the actions of the Real IRA, setting a precedent that resulted in the alienation and minuscule support for dissident groups within the Republican movement. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/m0009m8l/spotlight-on-the-troubles-a-secret-history-series-1-episode-7 |title=Spotlight on the Troubles: A Secret History Epside 7 |publisher=BBC |accessdate=2020 }</ref>\n\n===Elections and politics in 2000s===\nHowever, the Assembly elections of 30 November 2003 saw Sinn F\u00e9in and the [[Democratic Unionist Party]] (DUP) emerge as the largest parties in each community, which was perceived as making a restoration of the devolved institutions more difficult to achieve. However, serious talks between the political parties and the British and Irish governments saw steady, if stuttering, progress throughout 2004, with the DUP in particular surprising many observers with its newly discovered pragmatism. However, an arms-for-government deal between Sinn F\u00e9in and the DUP broke down in December 2004 due to a row over whether photographic evidence of IRA decommissioning was necessary, and the IRA refusal to countenance the provision of such evidence.\n\nThe [[2005 United Kingdom general election|2005 British general election]] saw further polarisation, with the DUP making sweeping gains, although Sinn F\u00e9in did not make the breakthrough many had predicted. In particular, the failure of Sinn F\u00e9in to gain the SDLP leader [[Mark Durkan]]'s Foyle seat marked a significant rebuff for the republican party. The UUP only took one seat, with the leader [[David Trimble]] losing his and subsequently resigning as leader.\n\nOn 28 July 2005, the IRA made a public statement ordering an end to the armed campaign and instructing its members to dump arms and to pursue purely political programmes. While the British and [[Irish government|Irish]] governments warmly welcomed the statement, political reaction in Northern Ireland itself demonstrated a tendency to suspicion engendered by years of political and social conflict.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/29/international/europe/29irish.html | work=The New York Times | title=I.R.A.

In large part unionists, at least in the north-east, supported its creation while nationalists were opposed.<!--Northern Ireland today remains a divided society with a legacy of civil conflict, at times made obvious through territorial markings such as painted kerbstones and the flying of the British or Irish national flags.-->\n\n==Resistance to Home Rule==\nFrom the late 19th century, the majority of people living in Ireland wanted the [[Her Majesty's Government|British government]] to grant some form of self-rule to Ireland. The [[Irish Nationalist Party]] sometimes held the balance of power in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, a position from which it sought to gain [[Home Rule]], which would have given Ireland autonomy in internal affairs, without breaking up the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]]. Two bills granting [[Home Rule]] to Ireland were passed by the House of Commons in 1886 and 1893, but rejected by the [[House of Lords]]. With the passing of the [[Parliament Act 1911]] by the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] government (which reduced the powers of the Lords from striking down parliamentary Bills to delaying their implementation for two years) it was apparent that Home Rule would probably come into force in the next five years. The [[Home Rule League|Home Rule Party]] had been campaigning for this for almost fifty years.\n\nHowever, a significant minority was vehemently opposed to the idea and wished to retain the [[Act of Union 1800|Union]] in its existing form. [[Irish unionists]] had been agitating successfully against Home Rule since the 1880s, and on 28 September 1912, the leader of the northern unionists, [[Edward Carson, Baron Carson|Edward Carson]], introduced the [[Ulster Covenant]] in [[Belfast]], pledging to exclude [[Ulster]] from home rule. The Covenant was signed by 450,000 men. Whilst precipitating a split with unionists in the south and west (including a particularly sizeable community in [[Dublin]]), it gave the northern unionists a feasible goal to aim for.\n\nBy the early 20th century, [[Belfast]], the largest city in Ulster, had become the largest city in Ireland. Its industrial economy, with strong engineering and shipbuilding sectors, was closely integrated with that of Great Britain. Belfast was a substantially [[Ulster Protestant]] town with a [[Catholic]] minority of less than 30 per cent, concentrated in the west of the city.\n\nA third [[Home Rule Act 1914|Home Rule Bill]] was introduced by the Liberal minority government in 1912. However, the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] was sympathetic to the unionist case, and the political voice of unionism was strong in Parliament. After heavy amendment by the House of Lords, the Commons agreed in 1914 to allow four counties of Ulster to vote themselves out of its provisions and then only for six years. Throughout 1913 and 1914, paramilitary \"volunteer armies\" were recruited and armed, firstly the unionist [[Ulster Volunteer Force (1912)|Ulster Volunteer Force]] (UVF), and in response, the nationalist [[Irish Volunteers]]. But events in [[World War I]] Europe were to take precedence. Home rule was delayed for the duration of what was expected to be a short war and unionist and nationalist leaders agreed to encourage their volunteers to join the [[British army]].\n\n==1916: Easter Rising, Battle of the Somme and aftermath==\nDuring [[World War I]], tensions continued to mount in Ireland. Hardline Irish separatists (known at the time as ''Irish Nationalists'' and later as ''Republicans'') rejected Home Rule entirely because it involved maintaining the connection with Britain. They retained control of one faction of the [[Irish Volunteers]], and in Easter 1916, led by [[Thomas Clarke (Irish republican)|Thomas Clarke]], [[James Connolly]] and others [[Easter Rising|attempted a rebellion in Dublin]]. After summary trials, the British government had the leaders executed for treason. The government [[History of Sinn F\u00e9in#Dual monarchy: 1905 to 1917|blamed the small Sinn F\u00e9in]] party, which had had little to do with it. The execution of the leaders of the rebellion turned out to be a propaganda coup for militant republicanism, and [[Sinn F\u00e9in]]'s previously negligible popular support grew. The surviving leaders of the Irish Volunteers infiltrated the party and assumed its leadership in 1917. (The Irish Volunteers would later become the [[Irish Republican Army]] (IRA) in 1919.) Republicans gained further support when the British government [[Conscription Crisis of 1918|attempted to introduce conscription to Ireland in 1918]]. Sinn F\u00e9in was at the forefront of organising the campaign against [[conscription]].\n\nThe [[36th (Ulster) Division]] was one of the first units in the British Army to be sent into the [[Battle of the Somme|Somme]] beginning in July 1916. Despite being one of the few divisions to achieve their objectives, the Ulstermen suffered nearly 85% casualties. Though the 36th Division was made up of both Catholics and Protestants from the north, one result from the heavy losses at the Somme was that the Unionist community became evermore determined to remain in the United Kingdom, believing themselves to have sacrificed theirs sons at the behest of the Crown. Nationalists joined in great numbers as well, with \"old\" Irish regiments from [[Munster]] and [[Leinster]] being greatly strengthened by these recruits. When the veterans of World War I, on both sides of the political divide, returned from the front in 1918 and 1919, they came back as battle-hardened soldiers. In the [[1918 Irish general election|general election of 1918]], the [[Irish Parliamentary Party]] lost almost all of its seats to Sinn F\u00e9in. Of the 30 seats in the six counties that would become Northern Ireland, 23 were won by Unionists, including 3 [[Labour Unionists]] and five of the six IPP members returned in Ireland were elected in Ulster as a result of local voting pacts with Sinn F\u00e9in.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ark.ac.uk/elections/h1918.htm |title=The Irish Election of 1918 |date=25 March 2006 |author=Nicholas Whyte |publisher=ARK |accessdate=25 October 2012 }}</ref>\n\n[[Guerrilla warfare]] gathered pace in Ireland in the aftermath of the election, leading to the [[Anglo-Irish War]]. Although lower in intensity in Ulster than the rest of Ireland, the conflict was complicated there by involving not only the IRA, [[British Army]] and [[Royal Irish Constabulary]], but the [[Ulster Volunteer Force (1912)|Ulster Volunteer Force]] (UVF) as well.\n\n==Partition==\n[[File:IrelandUlster.svg|right|thumb| Map of Ireland.

Some unionists such as Sir [[Edward Carson]] opposed partition, seeing it as a betrayal of unionism as a pan-Irish political movement. Three Counties unionists (those living in the Ulster counties of [[County Cavan|Cavan]], [[County Donegal|Donegal]], and [[County Monaghan|Monaghan]]) who found themselves on the wrong side of the new border that partitioned [[Ulster]], felt betrayed by those who had joined them in pledging to \"stand by one another\" in the [[Ulster Covenant]].<ref>http://www.historyireland.com/20th-century-contemporary-history/the-emergence-of-the-two-irelands-1912-25/</ref> The ''[[Belfast Telegraph]]'' reassured unionists who felt guilty about this \"that it was better for two-thirds of passengers to save themselves than for all to drown\".<ref>http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/issues/sectarian/brewer.htm</ref> Many Irish nationalists also opposed partition, although some were gratified that Northern Ireland contained a large nationalist minority that would deny it stability.\n\nThe Treaty was given effect in the United Kingdom through the [[Irish Free State Constitution Act 1922]]. Under Article 12 of the Treaty, Northern Ireland could exercise its ''opt out'' by presenting an address to the [[George V of the United Kingdom|King]] requesting not to be part of the Irish Free State. Once the Treaty was ratified, the [[Parliament of Northern Ireland]] had one month to exercise this ''opt out'' during which month the Irish Free State Government could not legislate for Northern Ireland, holding the Free State's effective jurisdiction in abeyance for a month.\n\nOn 7 December 1922 (the day after the establishment of the Irish Free State) the Parliament of Northern Ireland resolved to make the following address to the King so as to ''opt out'' of the Irish Free State:<ref>{{cite news |work=ahds.ac.uk |url=http://stormontpapers.ahds.ac.uk/stormontpapers/pageview.html?volumeno=2&pageno=1145#bak-2-1149 |title=Northern Ireland Parliamentary Report |date=7 December 1922 |pages=1147 and 1150 |publisher=Stormont Papers}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|MOST GRACIOUS SOVEREIGN, We, your Majesty's most dutiful and loyal subjects, the Senators and Commons of Northern Ireland in Parliament assembled, having learnt of the passing of the Irish Free State Constitution Act, 1922, being the Act of Parliament for the ratification of the Articles of Agreement for a Treaty between Great Britain and Ireland, do, by this humble Address, pray your Majesty that the powers of the Parliament and Government of the Irish Free State shall no longer extend to Northern Ireland.}}\n\nOn 13 December 1922 Prime Minister [[James Craig, 1st Viscount Craigavon|James Craig]] addressed the Parliament of Northern Ireland informing them that the King had responded to the Parliament's address as follows:<ref>{{cite news |publisher=Stormont Papers |work=ahds.ac.uk |url=http://stormontpapers.ahds.ac.uk/stormontpapers/pageview.html?volumeno=2&pageno=1145#fwd-2-1189 |title=Northern Ireland Parliamentary Report |date=13 December 1922 |volume=2 |pages=1191\u20131192}}</ref>\n\n{{cquote|I have received the Address presented to me by both Houses of the Parliament of Northern Ireland in pursuance of Article 12 of the Articles of Agreement set forth in the Schedule to the Irish Free State (Agreement) Act, 1922, and of Section 5 of the Irish Free State Constitution Act, 1922, and I have caused my Ministers and the Irish Free State Government to be so informed.}}\n\n==Early years of Home Rule==\nNorthern Ireland, having received [[self-government]] within the United Kingdom under the Government of Ireland Act, was in some respects left to its own devices.\n\nThe first years of the new autonomous region were marked by bitter violence, particularly in [[Belfast]]. The IRA was determined to oppose the partition of Ireland so the authorities created the (mainly ex-UVF) [[Ulster Special Constabulary]] to aid the [[Royal Irish Constabulary]] (RIC) and introduced emergency powers to combat the IRA. Many died in political violence between 1920 and 1923, during which Belfast experienced the worst violence in its history. Killings petered out in 1923 after the signing of the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]] in 1922.\n\n{{cquote|In total, 636 people were killed between July 1920 and July 1922 in Northern Ireland. Approximately 460 of these deaths occurred in Belfast (258 Catholics, 159 Protestants, and 3 of unknown religion). However, as Catholics made up less than one-quarter of the population of the city, the per capita death rates were much higher.<ref>Lynch, Robert, \"The People's Protectors?

As well as movement of Protestants from the Free State into Northern Ireland, some Catholics fled south, leaving some of those who remained feeling isolated. Despite the mixed religious affiliation of the old [[Royal Irish Constabulary]] and the transfer of many Catholic RIC police officers to the newly formed [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]] (1922), northern Catholics did not join the new force in great numbers. Many nationalists came to view the new police force as sectarian, adding to their sense of alienation from the state.\n\n==1925\u20131965==\nUnder successive unionist [[Prime Minister of Northern Ireland|Prime Ministers]] from [[Sir James Craig]] (later Lord Craigavon) onwards, the unionist establishment practised what is generally considered a policy of discrimination against the nationalist/Catholic minority.\n\nThis pattern was firmly established in the case of local government,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/issues/discrimination/whyte.htm |title='How much discrimination was there under the Unionist regime, 1921\u20131968?' by John Whyte |date=14 January 2012 |author=Fionnuala McKenna |publisher=ARK |accessdate=25 October 2012 }}</ref> where [[gerrymandering|gerrymandered]] ward boundaries rigged local government elections to ensure unionist control of some local councils with nationalist majorities.

Emigration to seek employment was significantly more prevalent among the Catholic population. As a result, Northern Ireland's demography shifted further in favour of Protestants, leaving their ascendancy seemingly impregnable by the late 1950s.\n\nThe abolition of [[proportional representation]] in 1929 meant that the structure of party politics gave the [[Ulster Unionist Party]] a continual sizeable majority in the [[Parliament of Northern Ireland]], leading to fifty years of [[one-party rule]]. While nationalist parties continued to retain the same number of seats that they had under proportional representation, the [[Northern Ireland Labour Party]] and various smaller leftist unionist groups were smothered, meaning that it proved impossible for any group to sustain a challenge to the Ulster Unionist Party from within the unionist section of the population.\n\nIn 1935, the worst violence since partition convulsed [[Belfast]]. After an [[Orange Institution|Orange Order]] parade decided to return to the city centre through a Catholic area instead of its usual route; the resulting violence left nine people dead.

It found little support among nationalists. However, many Catholics were resentful towards the state, and nationalist politics was fatalist. Meanwhile, the period saw an almost complete synthesis between the Ulster Unionist Party and the [[Ulster loyalism|loyalist]] [[Orange Institution|Orange Order]], with Catholics (even unionist Catholics) being excluded from any position of political or civil authority outside of a handful of nationalist-controlled councils.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tcbh.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/11/3/284.pdf |title=Assimilation versus Segregation: Unionist Strategy in the 1960s |year=2000 |author=MARC MULHOLLAND |publisher=Twentieth Century Brit Hist |accessdate=25 October 2012 }}</ref>\n\nThroughout this time, although the Catholic birth rate remained higher than for Protestants, the Catholic proportion of the population declined, as poor economic prospects, especially west of the [[River Bann]], saw Catholics emigrate in disproportionate numbers.\n\nNationalist political institutions declined, with the Nationalist Party boycotting the Stormont Parliament for much of this period and its constituency organisations reducing to little more than shells. [[Sinn F\u00e9in]] was banned although it often operated through the [[Republican Clubs]] or similar vehicles.

The unemployment that had been so persistent in the 1930s disappeared, and labour shortages appeared. There was a major munitions strike in 1944.<ref>Boyd Black, \"A Triumph of Voluntarism? Industrial Relations and Strikes in Northern Ireland in World War Two,\" ''Labour History Review'' (2005) 70#1 pp 5\u201325</ref> As a key industrial city, Belfast became a target for German bombing missions, but it was thinly defended; there were only 24 anti-aircraft guns in the city. The Northern Ireland government under [[Richard Dawson Bates]] (Minister for Home Affairs) had prepared too late, assuming that Belfast was far enough away to be safe. When Germany conquered France in Spring 1940 it gained closer airfields. The city's fire brigade was inadequate, there were no public air raid shelters as the Northern Ireland government was reluctant to spend money on them, and there were no searchlights in the city, which made shooting down enemy bombers all the more difficult. After the Blitz in London during the autumn of 1940, the government began to build air raid shelters. In early 1941, the Luftwaffe flew reconnaissance missions that identified the docks and industrial areas to be targeted. Working class areas in the north and east of the city were particularly hard hit, as over 1,000 people were killed and hundreds were seriously injured. Many people left the city in fear of future attacks. The bombing revealed terrible slum conditions in the city. In May 1941, the Luftwaffe hit the docks and the [[Harland and Wolff]] shipyard, closing it for six months. The [[Belfast blitz]] saw half of the city's houses destroyed. About \u00a320 million worth of damage was caused. The Northern Ireland government was criticised heavily for its lack of preparation, and Northern Ireland's Prime Minister [[J. M. Andrews]] resigned. The bombing raids continued until the invasion of Russia in summer 1941. The American army arrived in 1942\u201344, setting up bases around Northern Ireland.\n\n==The Troubles==\n{{Main|The Troubles}}\n[[File:History is written by the winner.jpg|thumb|History is written by the winner.

The increasing pressures from Irish nationalists for reform and opposition by Ulster loyalists to compromise led to the appearance of the [[Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association]], under figures such as [[Austin Currie]] and [[John Hume]]. It had some moderate Protestant support and membership, and a considerable dose of student radicalism after Northern Ireland was swept up in the worldwide [[protests of 1968]]. Clashes between marchers and the RUC led to increased communal strife, culminating in an attack by a unionist mob (which included [[Ulster Special Constabulary|police reservists]]) on a march, known as the [[Burntollet bridge incident]], outside [[Derry]] on 4 January 1969. Wholescale violence erupted after an [[Apprentice Boys]] march was forced through the Irish nationalist [[Bogside]] area of Derry on 12 August 1969 by the RUC, which led to large-scale disorder known as the [[Battle of the Bogside]]. Rioting continued until 14 August, and in that time 1,091 canisters, each containing 12.5g of [[CS gas]] and 14 canisters containing 50g, were released by the RUC. Even more severe rioting broke out in Belfast and elsewhere in response to events in Derry (see [[Northern Ireland riots of August 1969]]). The following thirty years of civil strife came to be known as \"the Troubles\".\n\nAt the request of the unionist-controlled Northern Ireland government, the [[British army]] was deployed by the UK [[Home Secretary]] [[James Callaghan]] two days later on 14 August 1969. Two weeks later, control of security in Northern Ireland was passed from the Stormont government to Lieutenant-General [[Ian Freeland]] ([[General Officer Commanding|GOC]]). At first the soldiers received a warm welcome from Irish nationalists, who hoped they would protect them from loyalist attack (which the [[Irish Republican Army (1922\u201369)|IRA]] had, for [[Official IRA#Reasons behind the split|ideological reasons]], not done effectively).{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} However, tensions rose throughout the following years, with an important milestone in the worsening relationship between the British Army and Irish nationalists being the [[Falls Curfew]] of 3 July 1970, when 3,000 British troops imposed a three-day curfew on the Lower Falls area of West Belfast.\n\nAfter the introduction of [[Operation Demetrius|internment]] without trial for suspected IRA men on 9 August 1971, even the most moderate Irish nationalists reacted by completely withdrawing their co-operation with the state. The [[Social Democratic and Labour Party]] (SDLP) members of the [[Parliament of Northern Ireland]] withdrew from that body on 15 August and a widespread campaign of [[civil disobedience]] began.\n\n===1972\u20131974===\nTensions were ratcheted to a higher level after the killing of fourteen unarmed civilians in Derry by the [[1st Battalion, Parachute Regiment]] on 30 January 1972, an event dubbed [[Bloody Sunday (1972)|Bloody Sunday]].\nMany civilians were killed and injured by the indiscriminate bombing campaigns carried out, mainly by the Provisional IRA.\nThroughout this period, the main paramilitary organisations began to form. 1972 was the most violent year of the conflict. In 1970 the [[Provisional IRA]], was created as a breakaway from what then became known as the [[Official IRA]] (the Provisionals came from various political perspectives, though most rejected the increasingly [[Marxist]] outlook of the Officials and were united in their rejection of the Official's view that physical force alone would not end partition), and a campaign of sectarian attacks by loyalist paramilitary groups like the [[Ulster Defence Association]] (formed to co-ordinate the various Loyalist vigilante groups that sprung up) and others brought Northern Ireland to the brink of civil war. On 30 March 1972, the British government, unwilling to grant the unionist Northern Ireland government more authoritarian special powers, and now convinced of its inability to restore order, pushed through emergency legislation that prorogued the Northern Ireland Parliament and introduced [[Direct rule over Northern Ireland|direct rule]] from London.<ref>[[Northern Ireland (Temporary Provisions) Act 1972]] (c. 22)</ref> In 1973 the [[British government]] dissolved the [[Parliament of Northern Ireland]] and its government under the [[Northern Ireland Constitution Act 1973]].\n\nThe British government held talks with various parties, including the Provisional IRA, during 1972 and 1973. The Official IRA declared a ceasefire in 1972, and eventually ended violence against the British altogether, although a breakaway group, the [[Irish National Liberation Army]], continued. The Provisional IRA remained the largest and most effective nationalist paramilitary group.\n\nOn 9 December 1973, after talks in [[Sunningdale]], Berkshire, the UUP, SDLP and [[Alliance Party of Northern Ireland]] and both governments reached the [[Sunningdale Agreement]] on a cross-community government for Northern Ireland, which took office on 1 January 1974. The Provisional IRA was unimpressed<nowiki>{{subst:Why?}}</nowiki>, increasing the tempo of its campaign, while many unionists were outraged at the participation of Irish nationalists in the government of Northern Ireland and at the cross-border [[Council of Ireland]]. Although the pro-Sunningdale parties had a clear majority in the new [[Northern Ireland Assembly, 1973|Northern Ireland Assembly]], the failure of the pro-Agreement parties to co-ordinate their efforts in the general election of 28 February, combined with an IRA-sponsored boycott by hardline republicans, allowed anti-Sunningdale unionists to take 51.1% of the vote and 11 of Northern Ireland's 12 seats in the UK House of Commons.\n\nEmboldened by this, a coalition of anti-Agreement unionist politicians and paramilitaries organised the [[Ulster Workers' Council strike]] which began on 15 May. The strikers brought Northern Ireland to a standstill by shutting down power stations, and after Prime Minister [[Harold Wilson]] refused to send in troops to take over from the strikers, the power-sharing executive collapsed on 28 May 1974.\n\nSome British politicians, notably former British [[The Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] minister [[Tony Benn]], advocated British withdrawal from Ireland, but many opposed this policy, and called their prediction of the possible results of British withdrawal the 'Doomsday Scenario', anticipating widespread communal strife. The worst fear envisaged a civil war which would engulf not just Northern Ireland, but also the Republic of Ireland and [[Scotland]], both of which had major links with the [[people of Northern Ireland]]. Later, the feared possible impact of British withdrawal was the '[[Balkanisation]]' of Northern Ireland.\n\nThe level of violence declined from 1972 onwards, decreasing to under 150 deaths a year after 1976 and under 100 after 1988.<ref>http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/sutton/book/</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/ni/security.htm#04 |title=Background Information on Northern Ireland Society \u2013 Security and Defence |date= 17 January 2012 |publisher=ARK |accessdate=25 October 2012 }}</ref> The Provisional IRA, using weapons and explosives obtained from the United States and [[Libya]], bombed England and various British army bases in Europe, as well as conducting ongoing attacks within Northern Ireland. These attacks were not only on \"military\" targets but also on commercial properties and various city centres. Arguably its signature attack would involve cars packed with high explosives. At the same time, loyalist paramilitaries largely (but not exclusively) focused their campaign within Northern Ireland, ignoring the uninvolved military of the [[Republic of Ireland]], and instead claiming a (very) few republican paramilitary casualties. They usually<ref>http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/cgi-bin/tab2.pl</ref> targeted Catholics (especially those working in Protestant areas), and attacked Catholic-frequented pubs using automatic fire weapons. Such attacks were euphemistically known as \"spray jobs\". Both groups would also carry out extensive \"punishment\" attacks against members of their own communities for a variety of perceived, alleged, or suspected crimes.\n\n===1975\u20131998===\nVarious fitful political talks took place from then until the early 1990s, backed by schemes such as [[rolling devolution]], and 1975 saw a brief Provisional IRA ceasefire. The two events of real significance during this period, however, were the [[1981 Irish Hunger Strike|hunger strikes]] (1981) and the [[Anglo-Irish Agreement]] (1985).\n\nDespite the failure of the hunger strike, the modern republican movement made its first foray into electoral politics, with modest electoral success on both sides of the border, including the election of [[Bobby Sands]] to the House of Commons. This convinced republicans to adopt the [[Armalite and ballot box strategy]] and gradually take a more political approach.\n\nWhile the Anglo-Irish Agreement failed to bring an end to political violence in Northern Ireland, it did improve co-operation between the British and Irish governments, which was key to the creation of the [[Belfast Agreement]] a decade later.\n\nAt a strategic level the agreement demonstrated that the British recognised as legitimate the wishes of the Republic to have a direct interest in the affairs of Northern Ireland. It also demonstrated to paramilitaries that their refusal to negotiate with the governments might be self-defeating in the long run. Unlike the Sunningdale Agreement, the Anglo-Irish Agreement withstood a much more concerted campaign of violence and intimidation, as well as political hostility, from unionists. Republicans were left in the position of rejecting the only significant all-Ireland structures created since partition.\n\nBy the 1990s, the perceived stalemate between the IRA and British security forces, along with the increasing political successes of Sinn F\u00e9in, convinced a majority inside the republican movement that greater progress towards republican objectives might be achieved through negotiation rather than violence at this stage.<ref>{{cite book |authorlink=Peter Taylor (journalist) |last=Taylor |first=Peter |year=1999 |title=Behind the mask: The IRA and Sinn F\u00e9in |chapter=21: ''Stalemate'' |pages=246\u2013261 |isbn=1-57500-077-6}}</ref> This change from paramilitary to political means was part of a broader [[Northern Ireland peace process]], which followed the appearance of new leaders in London ([[John Major]]) and [[Dublin]] ([[Albert Reynolds]]).\n\n==New government structure ==\n\n===The Belfast Agreement===\n{{main|Belfast Agreement|Northern Ireland peace process}}\n[[File:Northern Ireland election seats 1997-2019.svg|thumb|General election results 1997 to present. In general, the [[Ulster Unionist Party]] and [[SDLP]] have lost support, while [[Sinn F\u00e9in]], the [[Democratic Unionist Party]] and [[Alliance Party of Northern Ireland|Alliance]] have risen.]]\n\nIncreased government focus on the problems of Northern Ireland led, in 1993, to the two prime ministers signing the [[Downing Street Declaration]]. At the same time [[Gerry Adams]], leader of [[Sinn F\u00e9in]], and [[John Hume]], leader of the [[Social Democratic and Labour Party]], engaged in talks. The UK political landscape changed dramatically when the 1997 general election saw the return of a Labour government, led by prime minister [[Tony Blair]], with a large parliamentary majority. A new leader of the [[Ulster Unionist Party]], [[David Trimble]], initially perceived as a hardliner, brought his party into the all-party negotiations which in 1998 produced the [[Belfast Agreement]] (\"Good Friday Agreement\"), signed by eight parties on 10 April 1998, although not involving [[Ian Paisley]]'s [[Democratic Unionist Party]] or the [[UK Unionist Party]]. A majority of both communities in Northern Ireland approved this Agreement, as did the people of the [[Republic of Ireland]], both by [[referendum]] on 22 May 1998. The Republic amended [[Constitution of Ireland|its constitution]], to replace a claim it made to the territory of Northern Ireland with an affirmation of the right of all the people of Ireland to be part of the Irish nation and a declaration of an aspiration towards a [[United Ireland]] (see the [[Nineteenth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland]]).\n\nUnder the Good Friday Agreement, properly known as the [[Belfast Agreement]], voters elected a new [[Northern Ireland Assembly]] to form a parliament. Every party that reaches a specific level of support gains the right to name members of its party to government and claim one or more ministries. [[Ulster Unionist]] party leader [[David Trimble]] became [[First Minister of Northern Ireland]]. The Deputy Leader of the SDLP, [[Seamus Mallon]], became [[Deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland]], though his party's new leader, [[Mark Durkan]], subsequently replaced him. The [[Ulster Unionist]]s, [[Social Democratic and Labour Party]], [[Sinn F\u00e9in]] and the [[Democratic Unionist Party]] each had ministers by right in the power-sharing assembly.\n\nThe Assembly and its Executive operated on a stop-start basis, with repeated disagreements about whether the IRA was fulfilling its commitments to disarm, and also allegations from the [[Police Service of Northern Ireland]]'s [[Special Branch]] that there was an IRA spy-ring operating in the heart of the civil service. It has since emerged that the spy-ring was run by [[MI5]] (see [[Denis Donaldson]]). Northern Ireland was then, once more, run by the [[Direct rule over Northern Ireland|Direct Rule]] [[Secretary of State for Northern Ireland]], [[Peter Hain]], and a British ministerial team answerable to him. Hain was answerable only to the Cabinet.\n\nThe changing British position to Northern Ireland was represented by the visit of Queen [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Elizabeth II]] to Stormont, where she met nationalist ministers from the SDLP as well as unionist ministers and spoke of the right of people who perceive themselves as Irish to be treated as equal citizens along with those who regard themselves as British. Similarly, on visits to Northern Ireland, the [[President of Ireland]], [[Mary McAleese]], met with unionist ministers and with the [[Lord Lieutenant]] of each county \u2013 the official representatives of the Queen.\n\nDissident Republicans in the Provisional IRA who refused to recognize the Good Friday Agreement split from the main body and formed a separate entity known as the [[Real IRA]]. It was this paramilitary group that was responsible for the [[Omagh Bombing]] in August 1998 that claimed the lives of 29 including a mother and her unborn twins. In a break from traditional Republican policy, [[Martin McGuinness]] officially condemned the actions of the Real IRA, setting a precedent that resulted in the alienation and minuscule support for dissident groups within the Republican movement. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/m0009m8l/spotlight-on-the-troubles-a-secret-history-series-1-episode-7 |title=Spotlight on the Troubles: A Secret History Epside 7 |publisher=BBC |accessdate=2020 }</ref>\n\n===Elections and politics in 2000s===\nHowever, the Assembly elections of 30 November 2003 saw Sinn F\u00e9in and the [[Democratic Unionist Party]] (DUP) emerge as the largest parties in each community, which was perceived as making a restoration of the devolved institutions more difficult to achieve. However, serious talks between the political parties and the British and Irish governments saw steady, if stuttering, progress throughout 2004, with the DUP in particular surprising many observers with its newly discovered pragmatism. However, an arms-for-government deal between Sinn F\u00e9in and the DUP broke down in December 2004 due to a row over whether photographic evidence of IRA decommissioning was necessary, and the IRA refusal to countenance the provision of such evidence.\n\nThe [[2005 United Kingdom general election|2005 British general election]] saw further polarisation, with the DUP making sweeping gains, although Sinn F\u00e9in did not make the breakthrough many had predicted. In particular, the failure of Sinn F\u00e9in to gain the SDLP leader [[Mark Durkan]]'s Foyle seat marked a significant rebuff for the republican party. The UUP only took one seat, with the leader [[David Trimble]] losing his and subsequently resigning as leader.\n\nOn 28 July 2005, the IRA made a public statement ordering an end to the armed campaign and instructing its members to dump arms and to pursue purely political programmes. While the British and [[Irish government|Irish]] governments warmly welcomed the statement, political reaction in Northern Ireland itself demonstrated a tendency to suspicion engendered by years of political and social conflict.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/29/international/europe/29irish.html | work=The New York Times | title=I.R.A.

Under the agreement, Sinn F\u00e9in would fully endorse the police in Northern Ireland, and the DUP would share power with Sinn F\u00e9in. All the main parties in Northern Ireland, including the DUP and Sinn F\u00e9in, subsequently formally endorsed the agreement.\n\nOn 8 May 2007, devolution of powers returned to Northern Ireland. DUP leader [[Ian Paisley]] and Sinn F\u00e9in's [[Martin McGuinness]] took office as First Minister and Deputy First Minister, respectively. (BBC). \"[[You Raise Me Up]]\", the 2005 track by [[Westlife]], was played at their inauguration.\n\nOn 5 June 2008, [[Peter Robinson (Northern Ireland politician)|Peter Robinson]] was confirmed as First Minister, succeeding Ian Paisley. Following his resignation, [[Arlene Foster]] became First Minister on 11 January 2016.\n\n==Current developments==\n===Impact of 2017 elections on the Northern Ireland Executive===\n\n{{main|2017 Northern Ireland Assembly election}}\n\nOn 9 January 2017, following the [[Renewable Heat Incentive scandal]], [[Martin McGuinness]] resigned as deputy First Minister, triggering the [[2017 Northern Ireland Assembly election]] and the collapse of the [[Northern Ireland Executive]]. Since then, the Executive has been in suspension and has not reformed.\n\nThe election marked a significant shift in Northern Ireland's politics, being the first election since [[Partition of Ireland|Ireland's partition]] in 1921 in which unionist parties did not win a majority of seats, and the first time that unionist and nationalist parties received equal representation in the Assembly (39 members between Sinn F\u00e9in and the SDLP, 39 members between the DUP, UUP, and TUV). The DUP's loss of seats also prevents it from unilaterally using the [[petition of concern]] mechanism, which the party had controversially used to block measures such as [[same-sex marriage in Northern Ireland|the introduction of same-sex marriage to Northern Ireland]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.msn.com/en-gb/news/world/sinn-fein-cuts-dup-lead-to-one-seat-in-stormont-assembly-as-nationalists-surge-in-northern-ireland/ar-AAnLQ6B|title=Sinn Fein cuts DUP lead to one seat in Stormont Assembly as nationalists surge in Northern Ireland}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-nireland-mcguinness-politics-idUKKBN16T2XV|title=Northern Ireland braces for uncertain new era after McGuinness|last=Humphries|first=Conor|work=Reuters UK|access-date=23 March 2017|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n\nUUP leader Mike Nesbitt announced his resignation, following the party's failure to make any breakthrough.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-politics-39160617|title=Mike Nesbitt steps down as UUP leader|date=3 March 2017|via=www.bbc.co.uk|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170304115224/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-politics-39160617|archivedate=4 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nSinn F\u00e9in reiterated that it would not return to a power-sharing arrangement with the DUP without significant changes in the DUP's approach, including Foster not becoming First Minister until the RHI investigation is complete.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-northern-ireland-2017-39173640|title='No revolt within DUP,' says Foster|date=6 March 2017|via=www.bbc.co.uk|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170306143724/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-northern-ireland-2017-39173640|archivedate=6 March 2017}}</ref> The parties had three weeks to form an administration; failing that, new elections would likely be called.\n\nWhile unionism has lost its overall majority in the Assembly, the result has been characterised by political analyst Matthew Whiting as being more about voters seeking competent local leadership, and about the DUP having less success than Sinn F\u00e9in in motivating its traditional voter base to turn out, than about a significant move towards a united Ireland.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/politicsandpolicy/explaining-sinn-feins-electoral-success/|title=One step closer to a united Ireland?

It would have been inhabited by [[mammoth]]s, rhinos, hippos, giant deer and bison, which were preyed upon by sabre-toothed cats, lions, wolves and hyenas. As well as an abundant supply of game and edible plants, the river gravels were rich in flint deposits, which early humans would have found an invaluable resource.<ref name=\"CA288\" />\n\nThe Happisburgh finds mark the first time that evidence of early humans from 1,000,000 years ago has been found so far north. Palaeontologists had believed that hominins of the period required a much warmer climate, but the inhabitants of prehistoric Happisburgh had adapted to the cold, suggesting that they had developed advanced methods of hunting, clothing, sheltering and warming much earlier than previously thought.<ref name=\"CA288\" />\n\n==Archaeological context==\nHappisburgh has produced a number of significant archaeological finds over many years. As the shoreline is subject to severe [[coastal erosion]], new material is constantly being exposed along the cliffs and on the beach. Prehistoric discoveries have been noted since 1820, when fishermen trawling oyster beds offshore found their nets had brought up teeth, bones, horns, and antlers from elephants, rhinos, giant deer, and other extinct species. An exceptionally high tide in February 1825 exposed more prehistoric remains when it swept away sediment that had buried an ancient landscape of fossilized tree stumps, animal bones, and fir cones. In January 1877, a great storm swept huge [[ironstone]] slabs from the sea bed onto Happisburgh beach. The slabs preserved the impressions of leaves from oaks, elms, beeches, birches, and willows that had lived thousands of years ago. Pleistocene bison bones, found in the 1870s, provided the first evidence of early human activity; a re-examination of the bones in 1999 found that they were scored with tell-tale cut marks, indicating that the animals had been butchered by humans with stone tools.<ref name=\"CA288\"/>\n[[File:Happisburgh handaxe.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Paleolithic handaxe, from Happisburgh, found on the beach by a man walking his dog in 2000]]\nIn 2000, a black flint handaxe, dating to between 600,000 and 800,000 years ago, was found by a man walking on the beach. In 2012, for the television documentary ''[[Britain's Secret Treasures]]'', the handaxe was selected by a panel of experts from the British Museum and the [[Council for British Archaeology]] as the most important item on a list of fifty archaeological discoveries made by members of the public.<ref>{{Cite web | title=Britain's Secret Treasures Episode Six | url=http://finds.org.uk/secrettreasures/episodesix | publisher=Portable Antiquities Scheme | accessdate=8 February 2014 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | title=NMS-ECAA52 | date=12 July 2012 | url=http://finds.org.uk/database/artefacts/record/id/512140 | publisher=[[Portable Antiquities Scheme]] | accessdate=10 February 2014 }}</ref>\n\nSince the axe's discovery, the palaeolithic history of Happisburgh has been the subject of the Ancient Human Occupation of Britain (AHOB) and Pathways to Ancient Britain (PAB) projects, directed by Nick Ashton and [[Chris Stringer]], funded by grants from the [[Leverhulme Trust]] and Calleva Foundation. Between 2005 and 2010, eighty palaeolithic flint tools, mostly cores, flakes, and flake tools, were excavated from the foreshore in sediment dating back to up to 950,000 years ago.

Dating the site has instead been based upon [[stratigraphy]], [[palaeomagnetism]], and the evidence of fossil flora and fauna in the sediments.\n\nMagnetic signatures within the sedimentary deposits indicate they were laid down between the two most recent geomagnetic reversals \u2013 the [[Brunhes\u2013Matuyama reversal]] around 780,000 years ago and the [[Jaramillo reversal]] around 950,000 to 1 million years ago.\n\nThe evidence of fossil flora and fauna using indicators such as the fossilized teeth of [[vole]]s, which provide very accurate dating evidence, pushes the lower limit back to at least 840,000 years ago.\n\nOn this basis, the range of possible dates for the deposition of the sediments that the footprints were found in stretches from 850,000 to 950,000 years ago, but further research is necessary to narrow the window.<ref name=\"CA288\" /><ref name=\"independent-2014-02-08\"/><ref>{{Cite web | title=Dating the site | url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/research_projects/all_current_projects/featured_project_happisburgh/dating_the_site.aspx | publisher=British Museum | accessdate=8 February 2014 }}</ref>\n\n==Pleistocene geography==\nAt the time the Happisburgh hominins lived, a land bridge existed between Britain and France before the formation of the [[English Channel]] about 450,000 years ago.

It would have been inhabited by [[mammoth]]s, rhinos, hippos, giant deer and bison, which were preyed upon by sabre-toothed cats, lions, wolves and hyenas. As well as an abundant supply of game and edible plants, the river gravels were rich in flint deposits, which early humans would have found an invaluable resource.<ref name=\"CA288\" />\n\nThe Happisburgh finds mark the first time that evidence of early humans from 1,000,000 years ago has been found so far north. Palaeontologists had believed that hominins of the period required a much warmer climate, but the inhabitants of prehistoric Happisburgh had adapted to the cold, suggesting that they had developed advanced methods of hunting, clothing, sheltering and warming much earlier than previously thought.<ref name=\"CA288\" />\n\n==Archaeological context==\nHappisburgh has produced a number of significant archaeological finds over many years. As the shoreline is subject to severe [[coastal erosion]], new material is constantly being exposed along the cliffs and on the beach. Prehistoric discoveries have been noted since 1820, when fishermen trawling oyster beds offshore found their nets had brought up teeth, bones, horns and antlers from elephants, rhinos, giant deer and other extinct species. An exceptionally high tide in February 1825 exposed more prehistoric remains when it swept away sediment that had buried an ancient landscape of fossilized tree stumps, animal bones and fir cones. In January 1877, a great storm swept huge [[ironstone]] slabs from the sea bed onto Happisburgh beach. The slabs preserved the impressions of leaves from oaks, elms, beeches, birches and willows that had lived thousands of years ago. Pleistocene bison bones found in the 1870s provided the first evidence of early human activity; a re-examination of the bones in 1999 found that they were scored with tell-tale cut marks, indicating that the animals had been butchered by humans with stone tools.<ref name=\"CA288\"/>\n[[File:Happisburgh handaxe.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Paleolithic handaxe from Happisburgh, found on the beach by a man walking his dog in 2000]]\nIn 2000, a black flint handaxe, dating to between 600,000 and 800,000 years ago, was found by a man walking on the beach.

Between 2005 and 2010, eighty palaeolithic flint tools, mostly cores, flakes and flake tools, were excavated from the foreshore in sediment dating back to up to 950,000 years ago.

Three regions of Latvia meet in the vicinity of Tukums \u2013 [[Vidzeme]], [[Zemgale]] and [[Courland]].\n\n== History ==\n\nThe historical center of Tukums developed between trade routes leading from the mouth of the [[Daugava River]] to [[Prussia]]. The oldest part is today's Talsi Street that originated at the river named Zvirgzdupite where there used to be a castle mound with a wooden castle. Since 1253 Tukums was ruled by the [[Livonian Order]]. A masonry castle was built on the bank of the [[Slocene]] river in the end of the 13th century. The castle was surrounded by settlements of [[Germans|German]] tradesmen and craftsmen. A marketplace was formed in front of the castle and some new streets appeared later running in various directions from the market place.\n\nWith the development of trade in the 16th century a new straighter trade route to Prussia was built along a new street that is called Liela (large) Street today. This street had an important role in the life of the settlement. Public buildings, major business, workshops and shops were concentrated in it.\n\nAfter the disintegration of the Livonian Order a new state, the [[Duchy of Courland and Semigallia]] was established. Like many other settlements Tukums had suffered greatly the numerous feudal wars. Under the rule of [[Jacob Kettler|Duke Jacob]] (1642\u20131682) Tukums experienced a rapid economic boom. At the time a new trade route from Tukums to [[Jelgava]], the capital of Duchy of Courland and Semigallia, was opened along today's Jelgavas Street, and another route was made along today's Raudas Street towards it. A dam was built and a lake made near the road to Jelgava. A flour mill and a cooper furnace started functioning there, and cooper was exported to foreign countries. The town, inhabited by only 800 people was quite small. The new adornment of Tukums was the lake. The church spire was another landmark added to the skyline in 1687.\n\nAfter 1795 Courland was incorporated into the  [[Russian Empire]]. In November of the same year the [[Catherine II of Russia|Russian Tsaritsa Katherine]] signed a document to divide Courland into regions and to grant regional center rights to several urban settlements, Tukums being one of them.\n\nThe town borders were marked in 1800 and the first urban map was made only two years later. The town continued growing. It included 131 private houses, mostly wooden, and 6 pubs. There were 690 male and 832 female inhabitants. The first school was opened in 1806. Street pavement was introduced in 1860 and street lighting started in 1875. A more rapid development of the town was observed after the opening of the Riga-Tukums railway line in 1877 and of another line connecting Tukums with [[Ventspils]] a little later. 24 enterprises were functioning in Tukums in 1897: tanneries, wood carding-mills, a glue plant and also pottery and food production facilities. The two windmills brought out the uniqueness of the townscape.\n\nThe town grew with the development of industry. Two new districts appeared. The rich built their houses in the eastern part around Elizabetes, Pils and Baznicas Streets, but the workers settled more to the west, forming an area of small houses surrounded by gardens. This part of Tukums was further developed during the year in 1935. In the beginning of the 1930s there were 8000 inhabitants and 73 functioning industrial enterprises in Tukums.\n\n== Places near Tukums ==\n\nThe [[Engure parish]] by the city was host to the [[Soviet Navy]] [[Tukums air base]]. It was converted into a civilian airport.\n\n[[Jaunpils Castle]] is the only fortified castle of the [[Order of Livonia]] that remains in Latvia. It was built in 1301. An exhibition hall and museum are located there on the history of the district. Jaunpils Lutheran Church which was built in 1592 is located near the castle.\n\n[[Jaunmoka Castle|Jaunmoku Palace]] (1901), {{convert|5|km|0|abbr=on}} from Tukums, surrounded by the Courlands hills, hosts an exhibition on forestry. Jaunmoku Palace is a combination of [[Art Nouveau]] elements and [[Neo-Gothic]] forms and was built as the country residence of [[George Armitstead, 1st Baron Armitstead|George Armitstead]], mayor of Riga (1901\u201312).\n\n[[Durbe Manor|Durbe manor house]], ({{lang-lv|Durbes pils}}) rebuilt in 1820, is a classical style palace, surrounded by a landscaped park. A stone bridge across the ravine and a [[Rotunda (architecture)|rotunda]] are located near the manor house.\n\nThe Schlokenbeck estate ensemble in Milzkalne, dating from the 15th century, is the only fortified [[manor house]] in Latvia. A museum on the history of broad building techniques and an exposition of horse gear is set up there.\n\nIn Zante region there is the highest peak of Tukums district \u2013 Smiltinkalns (153m), in the center of Zante there is a Red Army tank, evidence of the battles in \"[[Courland Pocket]]\" in 1944\u20131945.\n\nThe country of Zentene and Seme has the northern landscape of Courland \u2013 hills, curved roads, objects of nature and places of culture history.\n\nThe seashore of Tukums district has a length of {{convert|50|km|0|abbr=on}}, where old fishermen's huts alternate with modern villas, and sandy beaches interchange with rocky shores and meadows.\n\n[[Kandava]] was the capital of the ancient Couronian state of Vanema. In the beginning of the 13th century, German knights built their castle there, though not much has been preserved from that time. In the Middle Ages, Kandava underwent numerous wars, fires and plague epidemics. \n\nThe Kandava hills are covered with dense forests and the [[Abava Rapids]] of the [[Abava River]]. Kandava marks the beginning of the run of the [[Abava Valley]], which is often locally referred to as \"Switzerland of Courland\" in as early as the 19th century. Since January 2011, the valley has been on Latvia's Tentative World Heritage List, according to World Monuments Fund. <ref name=\"mb.com.ph\">{{cite web|url=https://www.wmf.org/project/abava-valley-cultural-landscape|title=Abava Valley has been on Latvia's Tentative World Heritage List, January 2011|last=|first=|date=|website=WMF.org|url-status=live|archiveurl=|archivedate=|accessdate=April 8, 2020}}</ref>\n\n== Places in Tukums ==\n\n=== Museums ===\n[[File:Durbes pils 19.gs.jpg|thumb|Durbe manor house in the 19th century.]]\n* Castle Tower of Tukums \u2013 Brivibas square 19a\n* Durbe Manor house \u2013 M.Parka street 7\n* Jaunmokas Palace Museum \u2013 Jaunmokas\n* Jaunpils Museum \u2013 Jaunpils\n* Pastari\u0146\u0161 Museum \u2013 Bisnieki, Zentene\n* [[\u0160lokenbeka Castle|\u0160lokenbeka Manor]] \u2013 Milzkalne\n* Tukums Museum \u2013 Harmonijas street 7\n\n==Notable people==\n[[File:Joe Magidsohn.jpg|thumb|right|170px|[[Joe Magidsohn]]]]\n*[[Ronalds Ar\u0101js]], Latvian athlete\n*[[Kristaps Blanks]], [[football (soccer)|football]] [[Striker (association football)|striker]], [[Skonto FC]] and Latvian national football team player\n*[[\u0100dolfs B\u013codnieks]], [[Prime Minister of Latvia]]\n*[[L\u012bga K\u013cavi\u0146a]], Latvian heptathlete\n*[[Dainis K\u016bla]], [[javelin throw]]er and [[1980 Summer Olympics|1980 Olympic]] champion\n*[[Jevg\u0113\u0146ijs Kosma\u010dovs]], [[FK Ventspils]] and Latvian national football team midfielder\n*[[Joe Magidsohn]], Football All-American\n*[[Janis Roze]], Latvian Biologist, philosopher\n*[[Samanta T\u012bna]], singer\n*[[Viktor Tsoi]], [[Soviet Rock]] band [[Kino (band)|Kino]] leader died near Tukums.\n*[[Bertram Zarins]], prominent orthopedic surgeon at [[Massachusetts General Hospital]] and [[Harvard University]], born in Tukums\n\n==Twin towns \u2014 sister cities==\n{{See also|List of twin towns and sister cities in Latvia}}\n\nTukums is [[Twin towns and sister cities|twinned]] with:<ref>{{cite web |title=Starptautisk\u0101 sadarb\u012bba|url=https://www.tukums.lv/lv/tukuma-novada-pasvaldiba-1/starptautiska-sadarbiba|website=tukums.lv|publisher=Tukums|language=lv|accessdate=2019-08-31}}</ref>\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n*{{flagicon|POL}} [[Andrych\u00f3w]], Poland\n*{{flagicon|ISR}} [[Bnei Ayish]], Israel\n*{{flagicon|FRA}} [[Chennevi\u00e8res-sur-Marne]], France\n*{{flagicon|UKR}} [[Izium]], Ukraine\n*{{flagicon|BLR}} [[Karelichy]], Belarus\n*{{flagicon|RUS}} [[Krasnogorsk, Moscow Oblast|Krasnogorsk]], Russia\n*{{flagicon|LTU}} [[Plung\u0117]], Lithuania\n*{{flagicon|GER}} [[Schee\u00dfel]], Germany\n*{{flagicon|SWE}} [[Tidaholm]], Sweden\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Newspapers ==\n* ''[[Neatkar\u012bg\u0101s Tukuma Zi\u0146as]]''\n* ''[[Tukuma Zi\u0146ot\u0101js]]''\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n\n*[https://www.tukums.lv/lv/tukuma-novads/par-novadu Site of Tukums city]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20090729084138/http://www.turisms.tukums.lv/index/vietas?lang=3 Tukums Tourist Information Center]\n*[https://www.wmf.org/project/abava-valley-cultural-landscape World Monuments Fund]\n\n{{Cities and parishes of Tukums District}}\n{{Latvian regional cities}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Tukums|*]]\n[[Category:Towns in Latvia]]\n[[Category:1795 establishments in Europe]]\n[[Category:Castles of the Teutonic Knights]]\n[[Category:Tuckum County]]\n[[Category:18th-century establishments in Latvia]]\n[[Category:Tukums Municipality]]\n", "text_old": "{{for|the 1984 Danish film|Tukuma (film)}}\n{{Unreferenced|date=October 2014}}\n{{Infobox settlement\n| name = Tukums\n| other_name = \n| settlement_type = Town\n| image_shield =Coat_of_Arms_of_Tukums.svg\n| shield_size = \n| image_flag =Flag_of_Tukums.svg\n| flag_size = \n| image_skyline = Tukums, luter\u00e1nsk\u00fd kostel.jpg\n| imagesize = \n| image_caption = Lutheran church in Tukums\n| subdivision_type = Country\n| subdivision_name = {{flag|Latvia}}\n| subdivision_type1 = [[Districts of Latvia|District]]\n| subdivision_name1 = [[Tukums Municipality]]\n| established_title = [[Town rights]]\n| established_date  = 1795\n| pushpin_map            = Latvia\n| pushpin_label_position = above\n| pushpin_mapsize        = 300\n| pushpin_map_caption    = Location in Latvia\n| coordinates     = {{coord|56|58|N|23|09|E|region:LV_type:city|display=inline,title}}\n| nickname = \n| leader_title = \n| leader_name = \n| blank_name_sec1 = \n| blank_info_sec1 = \n| area_total_km2  = \n| area_water_km2  = \n| area_land_km2   = \n| area_metro_km2  = \n| elevation_m     = \n| population_total = 19722\n| population_metro = \n| population_density_km2 = \n| population_density_metro_km2 = \n| postal_code_type = [[Postal code]]\n| postal_code = LV310(1\u20132);

Street pavement was introduced in 1860 and street lighting started in 1875. A more rapid development of the town was observed after the opening of the Riga-Tukums railway line in 1877 and of another line connecting Tukums with [[Ventspils]] a little later. 24 enterprises were functioning in Tukums in 1897: tanneries, wood carding-mills, a glue plant and also pottery and food production facilities. The two windmills brought out the uniqueness of the townscape.\n\nThe town grew with the development of industry. Two new districts appeared. The rich built their houses in the eastern part around Elizabetes, Pils and Baznicas Streets, but the workers settled more to the west, forming an area of small houses surrounded by gardens. This part of Tukums was further developed during the year in 1935. In the beginning of the 1930s there were 8000 inhabitants and 73 functioning industrial enterprises in Tukums.\n\n== Places near Tukums ==\n\nThe [[Engure parish]] by the city was host to the [[Soviet Navy]] [[Tukums air base]]. It was converted into a civilian airport.\n\n[[Jaunpils Castle]] is the only fortified castle of the [[Order of Livonia]] that remains in Latvia. It was built in 1301. An exhibition hall and museum are located there on the history of the district. Jaunpils Lutheran Church which was built in 1592 is located near the castle.\n\n[[Jaunmoka Castle|Jaunmoku Palace]] (1901), {{convert|5|km|0|abbr=on}} from Tukums, surrounded by the Courlands hills, hosts an exhibition on forestry. Jaunmoku Palace is a combination of [[Art Nouveau]] elements and [[Neo-Gothic]] forms and was built as the country residence of [[George Armitstead, 1st Baron Armitstead|George Armitstead]], mayor of Riga (1901\u201312).\n\n[[Durbe Manor|Durbe manor house]], ({{lang-lv|Durbes pils}}) rebuilt in 1820, is a classical style palace, surrounded by a landscaped park. A stone bridge across the ravine and a [[Rotunda (architecture)|rotunda]] are located near the manor house.\n\nThe Schlokenbeck estate ensemble in Milzkalne, dating from the 15th century, is the only fortified [[manor house]] in Latvia. A museum on the history of broad building techniques and an exposition of horse gear is set up there.\n\nIn Zante region there is the highest peak of Tukums district \u2013 Smiltinkalns (153m), in the center of Zante there is a Red Army tank, evidence of the battles in \"[[Courland Pocket]]\" in 1944\u20131945.\n\nThe country of Zentene and Seme has the northern landscape of Courland \u2013 hills, curved roads, objects of nature and places of culture history.\n\nThe seashore of Tukums district has a length of {{convert|50|km|0|abbr=on}}, where old fishermen's huts alternate with modern villas, and sandy beaches interchange with rocky shores and meadows.\n\n[[Kandava]] was the capital of the ancient Couronian state of Vanema. In the beginning of the 13th century, German knights built their castle there, though not much has been preserved from that time. In the Middle Ages, Kandava underwent numerous wars, fires and plague epidemics. The Kandava hills are covered with dense forests and the [[Abava Rapids]] of the [[Abava River]]. Kandava marks the beginning of the run of the [[Abava Valley]], which is often locally referred to as \"Switzerland of Courland\" in as early as the 19th century and has been on Latvia's Tentative World Heritage List since January 2011, according to World Monuments Fund. <ref name=\"mb.com.ph\">{{cite web|url=https://www.wmf.org/project/abava-valley-cultural-landscape|title=Abava Valley has been on Latvia's Tentative World Heritage List, January 2011|last=|first=|date=|website=WMF.org|url-status=live|archiveurl=|archivedate=|accessdate=April 8, 2020}}</ref>\n\n== Places in Tukums ==\n\n=== Museums ===\n[[File:Durbes pils 19.gs.jpg|thumb|Durbe manor house in the 19th century.]]\n* Castle Tower of Tukums \u2013 Brivibas square 19a\n* Durbe Manor house \u2013 M.Parka street 7\n* Jaunmokas Palace Museum \u2013 Jaunmokas\n* Jaunpils Museum \u2013 Jaunpils\n* Pastari\u0146\u0161 Museum \u2013 Bisnieki, Zentene\n* [[\u0160lokenbeka Castle|\u0160lokenbeka Manor]] \u2013 Milzkalne\n* Tukums Museum \u2013 Harmonijas street 7\n\n==Notable people==\n[[File:Joe Magidsohn.jpg|thumb|right|170px|[[Joe Magidsohn]]]]\n*[[Ronalds Ar\u0101js]], Latvian athlete\n*[[Kristaps Blanks]], [[football (soccer)|football]] [[Striker (association football)|striker]], [[Skonto FC]] and Latvian national football team player\n*[[\u0100dolfs B\u013codnieks]], [[Prime Minister of Latvia]]\n*[[L\u012bga K\u013cavi\u0146a]], Latvian heptathlete\n*[[Dainis K\u016bla]], [[javelin throw]]er and [[1980 Summer Olympics|1980 Olympic]] champion\n*[[Jevg\u0113\u0146ijs Kosma\u010dovs]], [[FK Ventspils]] and Latvian national football team midfielder\n*[[Joe Magidsohn]], Football All-American\n*[[Janis Roze]], Latvian Biologist, philosopher\n*[[Samanta T\u012bna]], singer\n*[[Viktor Tsoi]], [[Soviet Rock]] band [[Kino (band)|Kino]] leader died near Tukums.\n*[[Bertram Zarins]], prominent orthopedic surgeon at [[Massachusetts General Hospital]] and [[Harvard University]], born in Tukums\n\n==Twin towns \u2014 sister cities==\n{{See also|List of twin towns and sister cities in Latvia}}\n\nTukums is [[Twin towns and sister cities|twinned]] with:<ref>{{cite web |title=Starptautisk\u0101 sadarb\u012bba|url=https://www.tukums.lv/lv/tukuma-novada-pasvaldiba-1/starptautiska-sadarbiba|website=tukums.lv|publisher=Tukums|language=lv|accessdate=2019-08-31}}</ref>\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n*{{flagicon|POL}} [[Andrych\u00f3w]], Poland\n*{{flagicon|ISR}} [[Bnei Ayish]], Israel\n*{{flagicon|FRA}} [[Chennevi\u00e8res-sur-Marne]], France\n*{{flagicon|UKR}} [[Izium]], Ukraine\n*{{flagicon|BLR}} [[Karelichy]], Belarus\n*{{flagicon|RUS}} [[Krasnogorsk, Moscow Oblast|Krasnogorsk]], Russia\n*{{flagicon|LTU}} [[Plung\u0117]], Lithuania\n*{{flagicon|GER}} [[Schee\u00dfel]], Germany\n*{{flagicon|SWE}} [[Tidaholm]], Sweden\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Newspapers ==\n* ''[[Neatkar\u012bg\u0101s Tukuma Zi\u0146as]]''\n* ''[[Tukuma Zi\u0146ot\u0101js]]''\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n\n*[https://www.tukums.lv/lv/tukuma-novads/par-novadu Site of Tukums city]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20090729084138/http://www.turisms.tukums.lv/index/vietas?lang=3 Tukums Tourist Information Center]\n*[https://www.wmf.org/project/abava-valley-cultural-landscape World Monuments Fund]\n\n{{Cities and parishes of Tukums District}}\n{{Latvian regional cities}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Tukums|*]]\n[[Category:Towns in Latvia]]\n[[Category:1795 establishments in Europe]]\n[[Category:Castles of the Teutonic Knights]]\n[[Category:Tuckum County]]\n[[Category:18th-century establishments in Latvia]]\n[[Category:Tukums Municipality]]\n", "name_user": "Infogapp1", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tukums"}

The bite-sized pieces of chocolate have a distinctive shape, commonly described as flat-bottomed [[Drop (liquid)|teardrops]].  Hershey's KISSES chocolates are wrapped in squares of lightweight [[aluminium foil|aluminum foil]].  A narrow strip of paper called a plume sticks out from the top of each Hershey KISS wrapper.   Originally designed as a flag for the \"Hershey's\" brand, the printed paper plumes were added to the KISSES product wrapper in 1921 in order to distinguish the Hershey's KISS from its competitors who offered similar products.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://hersheyarchives.org/encyclopedia/hersheyarchives30-18-only-hersheys-kisses-are-kisses/|title=HersheyArchives@30, Part 18: Only Hershey\u2019s Kisses are Kisses \u2013 Hershey Community Archives}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Old Hershey Kisses Ad photographed March 23 2013-8579.jpg|thumb|left|Old Hershey Kisses [[advertising|ad]]]]\n\nWhen first manufactured in 1907, the Hershey KISSES were wrapped by hand but in 1921, a machine was made so the Kisses would be wrapped automatically. This machinery also added the paper plume or paper strip flag to the aluminum foil wrapper to identify the Hershey's KISS, replacing the original small square of printed tissue that was inside the foil wrapper.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://hersheyarchives.org/encyclopedia/its-the-cocoa-bean-baby/|title=It\u2019s the Cocoa Bean, Baby \u2013 Hershey Community Archives}}</ref> In 1976, Hershey received a registered trademark for the Hershey's KISSES foil wrapper.\n\nIn 1924, Milton S. Hershey received a registered design trademark (Reg. 0186828) for \"foil wrapped conical configuration with plume\" which included the KISSES paper plume sticking out from the top of the aluminum foil wrapper.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tmsearch.uspto.gov/bin/gate.exe?f=doc&state=4805:8klpj5.2.1|title=TESS -- Error|website=tmsearch.uspto.gov}}</ref> \n\nDuring 1942, production of Hershey Kisses was briefly interrupted due to the rationing of aluminum foil. Instead, the machines were re-purposed to create [[military chocolate]] D ration bars for the soldiers in World War II. According to military historians, these chocolate D rations served two purposes: as a morale boost, and as a high-energy, pocket-sized emergency ration.  The ingredients of these four ounce bars were a blend of chocolate, sugar, cocoa butter, skim milk powder and oat flour containing 600 calories.  The specification for the D ration chocolate bars was that it had to \u201ca little better than a boiled potato\u201d so troops would only use them for emergencies.<ref>https://www.interesly.com/military-chocolate-bar-boiled-potato/</ref>  By the end of World War II, Hershey's had produced more than 3 billion D ration chocolate bars.<ref>https://www.history.com/news/hersheys-chocolate-allied-d-day-rations-wwii</ref>\n\n==Popularity==\nKisses are one of the most popular brands of candies in the US. In 1989, the chocolate drops were the 5th most popular chocolate brand in the United States, spawning sales that topped $400 million. More than 70 million Hershey's Kisses chocolates are produced each day at the company's two factories. Today's Kisses brand chocolates use Hershey's original [[milk chocolate]] formula.\n\nIn 2005 [[Hershey's Kissables]] were introduced as a smaller sized, candy coated version of Kisses chocolates. They were discontinued in 2009.\n{{-}}\n\n==Kisses brand varieties==\n[[Image:HolidayHersheyKissCarmel.jpg|thumb|Hershey's Kisses Milk Chocolates filled with [[caramel]].]]\n\nThough originally made of solely [[milk chocolate]], many variations of the Kisses brand of chocolates and candies have since been introduced.

This idea was the suggestion of John Figi, owner of Figi's \u201cGifts in Good Taste\u201d - a mail order food gifts company based in Marshfield, Wisconsin. The green and red colored wrapped chocolates were featured for the first time in the Figi's Christmas catalog.  \nIn 1968, pastel blue, pink, and green wrappers were introduced for [[Easter]], and in 1986, [[Valentine's Day]]-themed wrappers of red and silver were introduced. Xs and Os have also appeared on pink and red wrappers as well as little red hearts on silver wrappers for Valentine's Day. \"Fall Harvest\" colors were introduced in 1991. [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]] has silver with red stripes and blue-starred wrappers. Pink wrappers with \"ribbons\" on them to support breast cancer research have also appeared. Camouflage wrappers are also available, primarily on military bases. Kisses Dark Chocolates come in a deep purple wrapper.  The [[Halloween]] themed Kisses Candy Corn candies come in a wrapper whose colors imitate the color of a [[candy corn]] with yellow, white and orange stripes swirling around the candy. In 2016 four limited Holiday wrapper varieties were released: Santa hats, Kissmas sweaters that resemble knit Christmas sweaters, Kissmas Trees with plumes that read Fa La La, and Kissmas Presents with plumes that read from me to you. The Christmas themed Kisses Candy Cane candies also come in a wrapper whose colors imitate the color pattern (red stripes and white chocolate). The original silver (for regular) and gold (for almonds) wrappers are available year-round.\n\nHershey is introducing new pastel-colored wrappers with white polka dots for the upcoming Easter season. This created controversy within the organization because many workers and environmentalists have requested a more environmentally-friendly packaging, which would have eliminated the aluminum wrapping and replaced it with biodegradable materials. This was supposed to be rolled out on April 1, 2009.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}\n\n==Paper plume==\n[[File:Hershey's-Kiss-Wrapped-in-Foil-with-Plume-Sticking-Out.jpg|thumb|The \"KISSES\" labeled plume and silver aluminum foil are the traditional packaging for the Hershey's Milk Chocolate Kiss]]Hershey's KISSES wrappers have a paper strip called a plume sticking from the top of the foil wrapper.

The bite-sized pieces of chocolate have a distinctive shape, commonly described as flat-bottomed [[Drop (liquid)|teardrops]].  Hershey's KISSES chocolates are wrapped in squares of lightweight [[aluminium foil|aluminum foil]].  A narrow strip of paper called a plume sticks out from the top of each Hershey KISS wrapper.   Originally designed to flag the \"Hershey's\" brand, these printed paper plumes were added to the KISSES product wrapper in 1921 in order to distinguish the Hershey's KISS from its competitors who offered similar products.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://hersheyarchives.org/encyclopedia/hersheyarchives30-18-only-hersheys-kisses-are-kisses/|title=HersheyArchives@30, Part 18: Only Hershey\u2019s Kisses are Kisses \u2013 Hershey Community Archives}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Old Hershey Kisses Ad photographed March 23 2013-8579.jpg|thumb|left|Old Hershey Kisses [[advertising|ad]]]]\n\nWhen first manufactured in 1907, the Hershey KISSES were wrapped by hand but in 1921, a machine was made so the Kisses would be wrapped automatically. This is also when the paper plume or flag was added to the aluminum foil wrapper to identify the Hershey's KISS, replacing the original small square of printed tissue that was inside the foil wrapper.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://hersheyarchives.org/encyclopedia/its-the-cocoa-bean-baby/|title=It\u2019s the Cocoa Bean, Baby \u2013 Hershey Community Archives}}</ref>\n\nIn 1924, Milton S. Hershey received a registered design trademark (Reg. 0186828) for \"foil wrapped conical configuration with plume\" which included the KISSES paper plume or paper flag protruding from the top of the aluminum foil wrapper.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tmsearch.uspto.gov/bin/gate.exe?f=doc&state=4805:8klpj5.2.1|title=TESS -- Error|website=tmsearch.uspto.gov}}</ref> During 1942, production of Hershey Kisses was briefly interrupted due to the rationing of aluminum foil. Instead, the machines were used to create chocolate paste for the soldiers in World War II. In 1976, Hershey received a registered trademark for the Hershey's KISSES foil wrapper.\n\nKisses are one of the most popular brands of candies in the US. In 1989, the chocolate drops were the 5th most popular chocolate brand in the United States, spawning sales that topped $400 million. More than 60 million Hershey's Kisses chocolates are produced each day at the company's two factories. Today's Kisses brand chocolates use Hershey's original [[milk chocolate]] formula.\n\nIn 2005 [[Hershey's Kissables]] were introduced as a smaller sized, candy coated version of Kisses chocolates. They were discontinued in 2009.\n{{-}}\n\n==Kisses brand varieties==\n[[Image:HolidayHersheyKissCarmel.jpg|thumb|Hershey's Kisses Milk Chocolates filled with [[caramel]].]]\n\nThough originally made of solely [[milk chocolate]], many variations of the Kisses brand of chocolates and candies have since been introduced.

This idea was the suggestion of John Figi, owner of Figi's \u201cGifts in Good Taste\u201d - a mail order food gifts company based in Marshfield, Wisconsin. The green and red colored wrapped chocolates were featured for the first time in the Figi's Christmas catalog.  \nIn 1968, pastel blue, pink, and green wrappers were introduced for [[Easter]], and in 1986, [[Valentine's Day]]-themed wrappers of red and silver were introduced. Xs and Os have also appeared on pink and red wrappers as well as little red hearts on silver wrappers for Valentine's Day. \"Fall Harvest\" colors were introduced in 1991. [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]] has silver with red stripes and blue-starred wrappers. Pink wrappers with \"ribbons\" on them to support breast cancer research have also appeared. Camouflage wrappers are also available, primarily on military bases. Kisses Dark Chocolates come in a deep purple wrapper.  The [[Halloween]] themed Kisses Candy Corn candies come in a wrapper whose colors imitate the color of a [[candy corn]] with yellow, white and orange stripes swirling around the candy. In 2016 four limited Holiday wrapper varieties were released: Santa hats, Kissmas sweaters that resemble knit Christmas sweaters, Kissmas Trees with plumes that read Fa La La, and Kissmas Presents with plumes that read from me to you. The Christmas themed Kisses Candy Cane candies also come in a wrapper whose colors imitate the color pattern (red stripes and white chocolate). The original silver (for regular) and gold (for almonds) wrappers are available year-round.\n\nHershey is introducing new pastel-colored wrappers with white polka dots for the upcoming Easter season. This created controversy within the organization because many workers and environmentalists have requested a more environmentally-friendly packaging, which would have eliminated the aluminum wrapping and replaced it with biodegradable materials. This was supposed to be rolled out on April 1, 2009.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}\n\n==Paper plume==\n[[File:Hershey's-Kiss-Wrapped-in-Foil-with-Plume-Sticking-Out.jpg|thumb|The \"KISSES\" labeled plume and silver aluminum foil are the traditional packaging for the Hershey's Milk Chocolate Kiss]]Hershey's KISSES wrappers have a paper strip called a plume sticking from the top of the foil wrapper.  When the paper plume was added to the KISSES wrapper in 1921, originally it was a flag for the \"Hershey's\" brand, distinguishing Hershey's KISSES from its competitors.<ref>https://www.thevintagenews.com/2016/09/01/priority-hersheys-kisses-got-name-machine-makes-makes-kissing-sounds-appears-kiss-conveyor-belt-onto-chocolate-dispensed/</ref> a few years later in 1924, Hershey received a registered US trademark for its wrapper design, consisting of the conical foil wrapper plus the paper plume.\n\nLater \"Kisses\u00ae\" was printed on the paper plume, as well as other KISSES flavors.  The Company has also added special variety plumes (such as \"cheesecake\")and special messages have been available for various occasions, including:\n\n=== Seasonal ===\n<!-- Please respect alphabetical order -->\n*Friends all the time\n*Happy Halloween\n*Embrace the Memories\n*Peace train\n*Happy Holidays\n*Double Dip It\n*Hugs forever\n*Love is in the air\n*Rise and Grind\n*Love you to the moon and back\n*Cherish the Memories\n*Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year\n*We're all in this together\n*Hippity Hoppity\n\n==Packaging varieties==\n\n* Chinese New Year Gift Box - contains gold and red wrapped Kisses\n\n==Advertising==\n\"[[Christmas Bells (advertisement)|Christmas Bells]]\" is a commercial in which Hershey's Kisses, fashioned as a [[handbell choir]], perform the Christmas [[Carol (music)|carol]] \"[[We Wish You a Merry Christmas]]\".
