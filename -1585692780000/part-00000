Following a troubled tour for its previous album, ''[[Vitalogy]]'' (1994), in which Pearl Jam engaged in a much-publicized boycott of [[Ticketmaster]], the band went into the studio to record its follow-up. The music on the record was more diverse than what the band had done on previous releases, incorporating elements of [[garage rock]] and [[worldbeat]].\n\nAlthough ''No Code'' debuted at number one on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], making it Pearl Jam's third consecutive number one album, it left a large section of the band's fanbase unsatisfied and quickly fell down the charts. Critical reviews were also mixed, with praise to the musical variety but criticism to the album's inconsistency. The album became the first Pearl Jam album to not reach multi-platinum status, receiving a single [[RIAA certification|platinum]] certification by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] in the United States. \n\n==Recording==\nFor its fourth album, Pearl Jam again worked with producer [[Brendan O'Brien (music producer)|Brendan O'Brien]], with whom they had worked on predecessors ''[[Vs. (Pearl Jam album)|Vs.]]'' (1993) and ''[[Vitalogy]]'' (1994). ''No Code'' was the band's first album with drummer [[Jack Irons]], who had joined the band as ''Vitalogy'' was being completed. Following the summer U.S. leg of the band's [[Vitalogy Tour]], the band began work on ''No Code'' in [[Chicago]] in July 1995 during the infamous [[1995 Chicago heat wave|Chicago heat wave]]. The Chicago sessions lasted a week at the Chicago Recording Company. During a break in a string of make-up dates for the 1995 tour the band went into the studio for a week-long session in [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]], where the band recorded \"[[Off He Goes]]\".<ref name=\"lostdogs\">(2003) Album notes for ''Lost Dogs'' by Pearl Jam, [CD booklet].

''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]''. February 8, 1998.</ref> The band's mood had gotten better by the time the album was finished, and the bandmembers gave credit for this to Irons. Regarding Irons, O'Brien stated that \"everybody was on their best musical behavior around him.\"<ref name=\"tenpast\"/> McCready said that Irons urged the band members to discuss their problems, and called him \"a big spiritual influence, if not the biggest.\"<ref name=\"Garbarini\"/> Vedder said, \"Making ''No Code'' was all about gaining perspective.\"<ref name=\"spin\">Marks, Craig. \"The Road Less Traveled\".

It stood out with its emphasis on subtle harmony (\"[[Off He Goes]]\"), [[Music of Asia|Eastern]] influences (\"[[Who You Are (Pearl Jam song)|Who You Are]]\"), and [[spoken word]] (\"I'm Open\"). Irons lends a tribal drum sound on the songs \"Who You Are\" and \"In My Tree\".

Following a troubled tour for its previous album, ''[[Vitalogy]]'' (1994), in which Pearl Jam engaged in a much-publicized boycott of [[Ticketmaster]], the band went into the studio to record its follow-up. The music on the record was more diverse than what the band had done on previous releases, incorporating elements of [[garage rock]] and [[worldbeat]].\n\nAlthough ''No Code'' debuted at number one on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], making it Pearl Jam's third consecutive number one album, it left a large section of the band's fanbase unsatisfied and quickly fell down the charts. Critical reviews were also mixed, with praise to the musical variety but criticism to the album's inconsistency. The album became the first Pearl Jam album to not reach multi-platinum status, receiving a single [[RIAA certification|platinum]] certification by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] in the United States. \n\n==Recording==\nFor its fourth album, Pearl Jam again worked with producer [[Brendan O'Brien (music producer)|Brendan O'Brien]], with whom they had worked on predecessors ''[[Vs. (Pearl Jam album)|Vs.]]'' (1993) and ''[[Vitalogy]]'' (1994). ''No Code'' was the band's first album with drummer [[Jack Irons]], who had joined the band as ''Vitalogy'' was being completed. Following the summer U.S. leg of the band's [[Vitalogy Tour]], the band began work on ''No Code'' in [[Chicago]] in July 1995 during the infamous [[1995 Chicago heat wave|Chicago heat wave]]. The Chicago sessions lasted a week at the Chicago Recording Company. During a break in a string of make-up dates for the 1995 tour the band went into the studio for a week-long session in [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]], where the band recorded \"[[Off He Goes]]\".<ref name=\"lostdogs\">(2003) Album notes for ''Lost Dogs'' by Pearl Jam, [CD booklet].

''ACE Weekly''. 2003.</ref> Due to Pearl Jam balancing recording and touring, Irons commented that the band was \"more on-the-fly during the making of ''No Code'', and some good things happened out of that, but we were also really tired. It was difficult to tour and play these shows that were two or three hours long and then force ourselves to produce something in a studio.\"<ref name=\"Peiken\">Peiken, Matt. \"Jack Irons: This Inner Life\".

''Massive!''. February/March 1998.</ref> Ament said that the band members would bring in fragments of songs, and it would take hours before Vedder could have music to which he could add vocals.<ref name=\"Garbarini\"/> He added that \"Ed's typically the guy who finishes off the songs...But by the end of ''No Code'', he was so burnt, it was so much work for him.\"<ref name=\"philadelphia\">Moon, Tom. \"Calling Off the Crusades\". ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]''. February 8, 1998.</ref> The band's mood had gotten better by the time the album was finished, and the bandmembers gave credit for this to Irons. Regarding Irons, O'Brien stated that \"everybody was on their best musical behavior around him.\"<ref name=\"tenpast\"/> McCready said that Irons urged the band members to discuss their problems, and called him \"a big spiritual influence, if not the biggest.\"<ref name=\"Garbarini\"/> Vedder said, \"Making ''No Code'' was all about gaining perspective.\"<ref name=\"spin\">Marks, Craig. \"The Road Less Traveled\".

The song is heavily influenced by [[garage rock]].\n}}\nWhile ''Vitalogy'' had shifted away from the earlier albums' accessible compositions and polished production, ''No Code'' represented a deliberate break from ''[[Ten (Pearl Jam album)|Ten]]'''s [[Arena rock|stadium]] sound, favoring [[Experimental rock|experimental]] ballads and noisy [[garage rock]] songs. It stood out with its emphasis on subtle harmony (\"[[Off He Goes]]\"), [[Music of Asia|Eastern]] influences (\"[[Who You Are (Pearl Jam song)|Who You Are]]\"), and [[spoken word]] (\"I'm Open\"). Irons lends a tribal drum sound on the songs \"Who You Are\" and \"In My Tree\". Irons stated, \"To turn my drum music into a song is pretty challenging, but the guys have been really supportive of me doing it, and we've worked some things into a few songs.\"<ref name=\"Peiken\"/> Vedder said, \"We realized that we had an opportunity to experiment.\"<ref name=\"spin\"/> David Browne of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' stated that \"''No Code'' displays a wider range of moods and instrumentation than on any previous Pearl Jam album.\"<ref name=\"entertainmentweekly\"/>\n\nThe lyrical themes on the album deal with issues of spirituality, morality, and self-examination.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/><ref name=\"wayout\">Hilburn, Robert. \"Working Their Way Out of a Jam\".

It was ported to the [[Commodore 64]], [[Atari ST]] and [[Amiga]] in 1989 and [[1990 in video gaming|1990]]. Atari ST and Amiga ports were only released in Europe. The game, set in a [[dystopia]]n [[cyberpunk]] [[neo-noir]] world, is the first in the series of ''[[Tex Murphy]]'' mysteries; its immediate sequel is ''[[Martian Memorandum]]''. In 1998, ''Mean Streets'' was remade as ''[[Tex Murphy: Overseer]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nThe player plays the role of Tex Murphy, a down-and-out [[private investigator]] living in post-apocalyptic [[San Francisco]]. Tex is hired by a beautiful young woman named Sylvia Linsky to investigate the death of her father, Dr. Carl Linsky, a professor at the [[University of San Francisco]]. Prior to his death, Carl would not talk to his daughter about the secret project he was working on, and days later, he was seen falling off the [[Golden Gate Bridge]]. Sylvia suspects murder, but the police say it was routine suicide. To help get him started, Tex is given $10,000 and a few leads. The player is referred to the game's manual for a list of their leads.\n\n==Gameplay==\nThe game starts in Tex's speeder [[Flying car (fiction)|flying car]], and the player can perform various functions, including moving the speeder backward and forward, raise or lower the altitude, switching between different views, and accessing the on-board computer. The player can also contact Tex's secretary and informant and receive [[fax]]es from them if they ask for information. His informant demands money for information, but there are subjects which his secretary has no information on and his informant does.\n\nQuestioning people often results in them giving out information that further deepens the plot or produces new leads. To question people, the player must type in the full name of the person or thing Tex is to ask about. The player has the option of offering them money or threatening them when they appear uncooperative.\n\nIn some instances, the player receives an address of the person whom they asked about. These addresses consist of a four-digit code which the player enters into the computer on-board their speeder. Once the code has been entered, the destination is marked by a flashing square, and the player must either guide their speeder to it or enable the autopilot. As a form of [[copy protection]], the player is given no addresses to start with in-game, and must refer to the five addresses provided in the instruction manual.\n\nWhen arriving in a dangerous area, the game transitions to a side-scrolling shooter stage. The player must navigate Tex from the left side of the screen to the right while an endless supply of enemies emerges from the right side to shoot at Tex. Both Tex and enemies can crouch to hide behind the boxes and other debris which litter the streets, protecting them from gunfire but preventing them from hitting their targets as well. Tex can withstand several shots without dying, and his health is replenished upon completion of the stage. However, his ammunition is limited, and more ammunition can only be acquired by finding one of the caches hidden in buildings or by completing one of the game's bounty hunter sidequests.\n\nThere are some situations where Tex has to search buildings to get further leads. The player moves Tex around the area, and can push a button to bring up a list of nearby objects. The player has the options of looking at, getting, opening, moving, turning on and off, and tasting each object, though not every option will yield useful results. Some actions may yield access to a new object (e.g. opening a drawer may reveal a note inside), which the player can apply the same set of actions to. The player's primary objective is to collect information about a scientist, Carl Linsky, and the conspiracy behind his apparent suicide.\n\nThe game has seven bounty hunter sidequests which are accessed by landing on black landing strips. These landing strips do not have navigation codes, but the coordinates for them are given in the manual. Each sidequest consists of a side-scrolling shooter stage in the usual format, but with enemies which fire much more rapidly than those found on the main story path. Completing sidequests rewards the player with cash and ammunition.\n\n==Development==\nFollowing the release of their 3D flight game ''[[Echelon (Access Software)|Echelon]]'', Access wanted to develop another 3D flight game, this time based on the story of a homemade movie that the developers had made in their spare time about a film noir detective.{{Citation needed|date=September 2019}} Eventually, adventure elements eclipsed the flight sim aspects.\n\n''Mean Streets'' incorporates Access Software's [[RealSound]] technology for the IBM PC version.<ref>{{cite web |title=Saturday Crapshoot: Mean Streets |url=https://www.pcgamer.com/saturday-crapshoot-mean-streets/ |website=PC Gamer |publisher=PC Gamer |accessdate=20 October 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n''[[Computer Gaming World]]''{{'}}s [[Charles Ardai]] praised the game's \"exhilarating\" interactivity, stating that \"''Mean Streets'' offers a fully realized environment ... this license, this freedom, is refreshingly adult\", with excellent graphics and \"authentic [[hardboiled]] attitude and voice\".

It was ported to the [[Commodore 64]], [[Atari ST]] and [[Amiga]] in 1989 and [[1990 in video gaming|1990]]. Atari ST and Amiga ports were only released in Europe. The game, set in a [[dystopia]]n [[cyberpunk]] [[neo-noir]] world, is the first in the series of ''[[Tex Murphy]]'' mysteries; its immediate sequel is ''[[Martian Memorandum]]''. In 1998, ''Mean Streets'' was remade as ''[[Tex Murphy: Overseer]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nThe player plays the role of Tex Murphy, a down-and-out [[private investigator]] living in post-apocalyptic [[San Francisco]]. Tex is hired by a beautiful young woman named Sylvia Linsky to investigate the death of her father, Dr. Carl Linsky, a professor at the [[University of San Francisco]]. Prior to his death, Carl would not talk to his daughter about the secret project he was working on, and days later, he was seen falling off the [[Golden Gate Bridge]]. Sylvia suspects murder, but the police say it was routine suicide. To help get him started, Tex is given $10,000 and a few leads. The player is referred to the game's manual for a list of their leads.\n\n==Gameplay==\nThe game starts in Tex's speeder [[Flying car (fiction)|flying car]], and the player can perform various functions, including moving the speeder backward and forward, raise or lower the altitude, switching between different views, and accessing the on-board computer. The player can also contact Tex's secretary and informant and receive [[fax]]es from them if they ask for information. His informant demands money for information, but there are subjects which his secretary has no information on and his informant does.\n\nQuestioning people often results in them giving out information that further deepens the plot or produces new leads. To question people, the player must type in the full name of the person or thing Tex is to ask about. The player has the option of offering them money or threatening them when they appear uncooperative.\n\nIn some instances, the player receives an address of the person whom they asked about. These addresses consist of a four-digit code which the player enters into the computer on-board their speeder. Once the code has been entered, the destination is marked by a flashing square, and the player must either guide their speeder to it or enable the autopilot. As a form of [[copy protection]], the player is given no addresses to start with in-game, and must refer to the five addresses provided in the instruction manual.\n\nWhen arriving in a dangerous area, the game transitions to a side-scrolling shooter stage. The player must navigate Tex from the left side of the screen to the right while an endless supply of enemies emerges from the right side to shoot at Tex. Both Tex and enemies can crouch to hide behind the boxes and other debris which litter the streets, protecting them from gunfire but preventing them from hitting their targets as well. Tex can withstand several shots without dying, and his health is replenished upon completion of the stage. However, his ammunition is limited, and more ammunition can only be acquired by finding one of the caches hidden in buildings or by completing one of the game's bounty hunter sidequests.\n\nThere are some situations where Tex has to search buildings to get further leads. The player moves Tex around the area, and can push a button to bring up a list of nearby objects. The player has the options of looking at, getting, opening, moving, turning on and off, and tasting each object, though not every option will yield useful results. Some actions may yield access to a new object (e.g. opening a drawer may reveal a note inside), which the player can apply the same set of actions to.
