She is commemorated on 16 May in the [[Calendar of saints (Church of England)|calendar of saints]] of the [[Church of England]].

Her family lived at 11 Mayorhold. Her father, William Jones, had married four times. His first three wives had died in childbirth and from illness. Caroline was a daughter of William's last wife. William Jones, who was born in [[Wootton, Northamptonshire]], was a pig dealer, who fattened young pigs for sale. He died in 1814, when Caroline was six. He left his wife \u00a3500 and bequeathed several properties to his twelve surviving children.\n\nOn 27 December 1830, Caroline, then 22, married Archibald Chisholm, a Roman Catholic ten years her senior. He was an officer serving with the [[East India Company]]'s [[Madras Army]]. Around this time, Caroline converted to his faith, and they reared their children as Catholic.<ref name=Iltis>[http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/chisholm-caroline-1894/text2231, Iltis, Judith. \"Chisholm, Caroline (1808\u20131877)\", ''Australian Dictionary of Biography'', National Centre of Biography, Australian National University, published first in hardcopy 1966]</ref> They were married at [[The Holy Sepulchre, Northampton]], a [[Church of England]] church.

She joined him there 18 months later. Chisholm became aware that young girls growing up with their families in the barracks were picking up the bad behaviour of the soldiers. In 1834 she founded the Female School of Industry for the Daughters of European Soldiers, which provided a practical education for\nsuch girls. They were instructed in reading, writing and religion, cooking, housekeeping, and nursing. Soon soldiers asked if their wives could also attend the school.<ref name=\"walker\"/> \n\nWhile living in India, Chisholm gave birth to two sons, Archibald and William. The family followed her husband on his assignments around the Indian subcontinent.<ref name=\"walker\">Walker, Carole, See Chapter on \"India\" and Appendix 5: \"Rules and Regulations of the Female School of Industry\"</ref>\n\n==Sydney, New South Wales==\n[[File:Caroline Chisholm.jpg|thumb|Caroline Chisholm]]\nIn 1838 Captain Chisholm was granted a two-year [[Leave (military)|furlough]] on the grounds of ill health. Rather than return to England, the family decided the climate in [[Australia]] would be better for his health. They set sail for [[Sydney]], [[New South Wales]], aboard the ''Emerald Isle'', arriving there in October 1838. The family settled at nearby [[Windsor, New South Wales|Windsor]].<ref name=Iltis/>\n\nOn trips to Sydney, Chisholm and her husband became aware of the difficult conditions that faced immigrants arriving in the colony. They were particularly concerned for the young women who were arriving without any money, friends, or family, or jobs to go to. Many turned to prostitution to survive. Chisholm found placement for these young women in shelters, such as her own, and helped find them permanent places to stay. She started an organisation with the help of the governess for an immigrant women\u2019s shelter. In 1840 Captain Chisholm returned to his regiment in India, but he  encouraged his wife to continue her philanthropic efforts. She set up the first home in Sydney for young women and organised other homes in several rural centres. The home was soon extended to help immigrant families and young men.\n \n[[File:500 - Caroline Chisholm Cottage (5045654b4).jpg|thumb|left|[[Caroline Chisholm Cottage]] in [[East Maitland, New South Wales]]]]\n\nIn March 1842 Chisholm rented two terraced dwellings in [[East Maitland, New South Wales|East Maitland]]. She converted them into a single cottage to be used as a [[hostel]] for homeless immigrants who had travelled to the Hunter region in search of work. Now called [[Caroline Chisholm Cottage]], it is the only building in NSW so directly associated with Chisholm. Built in the 1830s, the cottage offers a rare example of early working-class housing in New South Wales.<ref name=nswshr-500>{{cite NSW SHR|5045654|Caroline Chisholm Cottage|hr=00500|fn=EF14/4920; S90/3312; HC 33185|access-date=1 June 2018}}</ref>\n\nDuring the seven years when Chisholm was in Australia, she placed over 11,000 people in homes and jobs. She became a well-known woman and much admired. She was requested to give evidence before two [[New South Wales Legislative Council|Legislative Council]] committees. Chisholm carried out her work in New South Wales without accepting money from individuals or individual organisations, as she wanted to act independently. She did not want to be dependent upon any religious or political body. The girls and families whom Chisholm helped came from different backgrounds and held different religious beliefs. She raised money for the homes through private subscription. Her husband was invalided out of the Army and returned to Australia in 1845.<ref>O.M. Flynn, \"Caroline Chisholm, the emigrants' friend,\" ''Journal of the Australian Catholic Historical Society'' 3 (2) (1970), 1-7.</ref>\n\n==Migration reforms and the Family Colonisation Loan Society==\nBefore Chisholm and her husband returned to England in 1846, they toured New South Wales (NSW), at their own expense, collecting over 600 statements from immigrants who had already settled there.<ref name=Iltis/> Chisholm believed the only way to encourage emigration from England to Australia was for prospective emigrants to read letters from fellow pioneers already living in the colony. In England the couple published some of these statements in a pamphlet titled ''Comfort for the Poor \u2013 Meat Three Times a Day''. The writer [[Charles Dickens]] used some of the statements in his new magazine ''[[Household Words]]''. Their daughter, [[Caroline Agnes Gray|Caroline Agnes]], was born in 1848 during the couple's time in London.\n\nChisholm gave evidence before two [[House of Lords]] [[Select committee (United Kingdom)|select committees]] and gained support for some of her initiatives. The Committee supported providing free passage to Australia for the wives and children of former convicts, and for the children that, through necessity, emigrants had left behind in England.\n\nIn 1849, with the support of [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 8th Earl of Shaftesbury|Lord Shaftesbury]], [[Sidney Herbert, 1st Baron Herbert of Lea|Sir Sidney Herbert]], and [[Wyndham Harding]] [[Royal Society#Fellows|FRS]], Chisholm founded the Family Colonisation Loan Society from her home in Charlton Crescent in [[Islington]]. The Society's aim was to support emigration by lending half the cost of the fare (the emigrant to provide the other half). After living two years in Australia, an emigrant would be expected to repay the loan. \n\nChisholm also held regular meetings at Charlton Crescent to give practical advice to emigrants. The Society initially found accommodation on board private emigrant ships. Later it chartered its own ships to transport emigrants. Chisholm's insistence that the Society's ships improve their accommodations resulted in the upgrading of the Passenger Acts. In 1851 her husband Archibald Chisholm returned to Australia to act as Honorary Colonial Agent, to help newly arrived emigrants and to collect repayment of loans. By 1854 the Society had assisted more than 3,000 people to emigrate to Australia. Chisholm gave emigration lectures throughout Britain, and also toured France and Italy. She collected their son William from the [[Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples|Propaganda College]], where he had been studying to become a Roman Catholic priest. Chisholm had an audience with [[Pope Pius IX]] at the Vatican, who gave her a Papal Medal and bust of herself.\n\n==Return to Australia and later life==\nIn 1854 Chisholm returned to Australia aboard the ''Ballarat''. She toured the [[Goldfields region of Victoria|Victorian goldfields]] and was appalled by the conditions en route. She proposed the construction of shelter sheds about a day's walk apart so that prospectors and their families could travel to the work of the goldfields. The project received support from the government. Chisholm continued to work in [[Melbourne]], travelling to and from the home and store which the Chisholms had purchased in [[Kyneton]]. She joined her family there three years later. Archibald served as a magistrate during his time in Kyneton, and the two elder sons helped him run the store.\n\nDue to Chisholm's ill health, the family moved back to Sydney in 1858. Her health improved. At the end of 1859 and beginning of 1860, Chisholm gave four political lectures. She called for land to be allocated so that emigrant families could establish small farms. She believed such action would provide greater stability among the new settlers in the colonies. Chisholm also wrote a novella,  ''Little Joe,'' that was serialised in the local paper.<ref>Chisholm, Caroline, ed. by John Moran, ''Radical in Bonnet and Shawl: Four Political Lectures''; and ''Little Joe''. (Australia: Preferential Publications, 1994 and 1991)</ref>\n\nHer husband accompanied the younger children back to England in 1865. Archibald Jr. accompanied his mother on her return to England in 1866. Chisholm died in London, England on 25 March 1877, and her husband died in August that year. Five of their eight children survived their parents.\n\nChisholm's body was taken to her home town, Northampton, where it rested overnight in the [[Northampton Cathedral|Cathedral of Our Lady and St Thomas]]. She and her husband are buried in the same grave in [[Billing, Northamptonshire|Billing]] Road Cemetery.\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:Australian $5 note paper back.jpg|thumb|1967 [[Australian five-dollar note]] reverse featuring Chisholm]]\n[[File:ChisholmPlaque.jpg|thumb|Plaque at 32 Charlton Place, Islington, London]]\n[[File:Breadalbane Anglican Church 004.JPG|thumb|The Chisholm Memorial Church at [[Breadalbane, New South Wales]]]]\n[[File:Caroline Chisholm Centre entrance March 2013.jpg|thumb|Caroline Chisholm Centre in [[Tuggeranong]] (ACT)]]\nOn 32 Charlton Place, [[Islington]], London, a [[blue plaque]] commemorates Chisholm living there; it was erected in 1983 by Greater London Council.<ref>{{cite web|title=A-Z of Islington's Plaques |url=http://www.islington.gov.uk/islington/history-heritage/heritage_borough/bor_plaques/Pages/a_z_plaques.aspx |publisher=Islington Council |access-date=22 October 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141022153504/http://www.islington.gov.uk/islington/history-heritage/heritage_borough/bor_plaques/Pages/a_z_plaques.aspx |archivedate=22 October 2014 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\nThe Chisholm Memorial Church (St Silas' Anglican church) at [[Breadalbane, New South Wales]] was founded in 1937 and named for her.\n\n*A number of educational facilities in Australia and England have been named after Chisholm.<ref>[http://www.chisholm.wa.edu.au/ Chisholm Catholic College].

She is commemorated on 16 May in the [[Calendar of saints (Church of England)|calendar of saints]] of the [[Church of England]]. There have been proposals for the [[Catholic Church]] also to recognise her as a saint; she had converted to Catholicism around the time of her marriage and reared her children as Catholic.<ref>[http://www.theage.com.au/news/National/Chisholms-supporters-push-for-sainthood/2007/10/24/1192941112318.html The Age: Chisholm's supporters push for sainthood] 24 October 2007 Retrieved on 2008-05-28</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nShe was born in 1808 as '''Caroline Jones''' in [[Northampton]], England, the last child of twelve born to her father, and the last of seven born to her mother, his fourth wife. Her family lived at 11 Mayorhold. Her father, William Jones, had married four times. His first three wives had died in childbirth and from illness. Caroline was a daughter of William's last wife. William Jones, who was born in [[Wootton, Northamptonshire]], was a pig dealer, who fattened young pigs for sale. He died in 1814, when Caroline was six. He left his wife \u00a3500 and bequeathed several properties to his twelve surviving children.\n\nOn 27 December 1830, Caroline, then 22, married Archibald Chisholm, a Roman Catholic ten years her senior. He was an officer serving with the [[East India Company]]'s [[Madras Army]]. Around this time, Caroline converted to his faith, and they reared their children as Catholic.<ref name=Iltis>[http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/chisholm-caroline-1894/text2231, Iltis, Judith. \"Chisholm, Caroline (1808\u20131877)\", ''Australian Dictionary of Biography'', National Centre of Biography, Australian National University, published first in hardcopy 1966]</ref> They were married at [[The Holy Sepulchre, Northampton]], a [[Church of England]] church.

She joined him there 18 months later. Chisholm became aware that young girls growing up with their families in the barracks were picking up the bad behaviour of the soldiers. In 1834 she founded the Female School of Industry for the Daughters of European Soldiers, which provided a practical education for such girls. They were instructed in reading, writing and religion, cooking, housekeeping, and nursing. Soon soldiers asked if their wives could also attend the school.<ref name=\"walker\"/> \n\nWhile living in India, Chisholm gave birth to two sons, Archibald and William. The family followed her husband on his assignments around the Indian subcontinent.<ref name=\"walker\">Walker, Carole, See Chapter on \"India\" and Appendix 5: \"Rules and Regulations of the Female School of Industry\"</ref>\n\n==Sydney, New South Wales==\n[[File:Caroline Chisholm.jpg|thumb|Caroline Chisholm]]\nIn 1838 Captain Chisholm was granted a two-year [[Leave (military)|furlough]] on the grounds of ill health. Rather than return to England, the family decided the climate in [[Australia]] would be better for his health. They set sail for [[Sydney]], [[New South Wales]], aboard the ''Emerald Isle'', arriving there in October 1838. The family settled at nearby [[Windsor, New South Wales|Windsor]].<ref name=Iltis/>\n\nOn trips to Sydney, Chisholm and her husband became aware of the difficult conditions that faced immigrants arriving in the colony. They were particularly concerned for the young women who were arriving without any money, friends, or family, or jobs to go to. Many turned to prostitution to survive. Chisholm found placement for these young women in shelters, such as her own, and helped find them permanent places to stay. She started an organisation with the help of the governess for an immigrant women\u2019s shelter. In 1840 Captain Chisholm returned to his regiment in India, but he  encouraged his wife to continue her philanthropic efforts. She set up the first home in Sydney for young women and organised other homes in several rural centres. The home was soon extended to help immigrant families and young men.\n \n[[File:500 - Caroline Chisholm Cottage (5045654b4).jpg|thumb|left|[[Caroline Chisholm Cottage]] in [[East Maitland, New South Wales]]]]\n\nIn March 1842 Chisholm rented two terraced dwellings in [[East Maitland, New South Wales|East Maitland]]. She converted them into a single cottage to be used as a [[hostel]] for homeless immigrants who had travelled to the Hunter region in search of work. Now called [[Caroline Chisholm Cottage]], it is the only building in NSW so directly associated with Chisholm. Built in the 1830s, the cottage offers a rare example of early working-class housing in New South Wales.<ref name=nswshr-500>{{cite NSW SHR|5045654|Caroline Chisholm Cottage|hr=00500|fn=EF14/4920; S90/3312; HC 33185|access-date=1 June 2018}}</ref>\n\nDuring the seven years when Chisholm was in Australia, she placed over 11,000 people in homes and jobs. She became a well-known woman and much admired. She was requested to give evidence before two [[New South Wales Legislative Council|Legislative Council]] committees. Chisholm carried out her work in New South Wales without accepting money from individuals or individual organisations, as she wanted to act independently. She did not want to be dependent upon any religious or political body. The girls and families whom Chisholm helped came from different backgrounds and held different religious beliefs. She raised money for the homes through private subscription. Her husband was invalided out of the Army and returned to Australia in 1845.<ref>O.M. Flynn, \"Caroline Chisholm, the emigrants' friend,\" ''Journal of the Australian Catholic Historical Society'' 3 (2) (1970), 1-7.</ref>\n\n==Migration reforms and the Family Colonisation Loan Society==\nBefore Chisholm and her husband returned to England in 1846, they toured New South Wales (NSW), at their own expense, collecting over 600 statements from immigrants who had already settled there.<ref name=Iltis/> Chisholm believed the only way to encourage emigration from England to Australia was for prospective emigrants to read letters from fellow pioneers already living in the colony. In England the couple published some of these statements in a pamphlet titled ''Comfort for the Poor \u2013 Meat Three Times a Day''. The writer [[Charles Dickens]] used some of the statements in his new magazine ''[[Household Words]]''. Their daughter, [[Caroline Agnes Gray|Caroline Agnes]], was born in 1848 during the couple's time in London.\n\nChisholm gave evidence before two [[House of Lords]] [[Select committee (United Kingdom)|select committees]] and gained support for some of her initiatives. The Committee supported providing free passage to Australia for the wives and children of former convicts, and for the children that, through necessity, emigrants had left behind in England.\n\nIn 1849, with the support of [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 8th Earl of Shaftesbury|Lord Shaftesbury]], [[Sidney Herbert, 1st Baron Herbert of Lea|Sir Sidney Herbert]], and [[Wyndham Harding]] [[Royal Society#Fellows|FRS]], Chisholm founded the Family Colonisation Loan Society from her home in Charlton Crescent in [[Islington]]. The Society's aim was to support emigration by lending half the cost of the fare (the emigrant to provide the other half). After living two years in Australia, an emigrant would be expected to repay the loan. \n\nChisholm also held regular meetings at Charlton Crescent to give practical advice to emigrants. The Society initially found accommodation on board private emigrant ships. Later it chartered its own ships to transport emigrants. Chisholm's insistence that the Society's ships improve their accommodations resulted in the upgrading of the Passenger Acts. In 1851 her husband Archibald Chisholm returned to Australia to act as Honorary Colonial Agent, to help newly arrived emigrants and to collect repayment of loans. By 1854 the Society had assisted more than 3,000 people to emigrate to Australia. Chisholm gave emigration lectures throughout Britain, and also toured France and Italy. She collected their son William from the [[Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples|Propaganda College]], where he had been studying to become a Roman Catholic priest. Chisholm had an audience with [[Pope Pius IX]] at the Vatican, who gave her a Papal Medal and bust of herself.\n\n==Return to Australia and later life==\nIn 1854 Chisholm returned to Australia aboard the ''Ballarat''. She toured the [[Goldfields region of Victoria|Victorian goldfields]] and was appalled by the conditions en route. She proposed the construction of shelter sheds about a day's walk apart so that prospectors and their families could travel to the work of the goldfields. The project received support from the government. Chisholm continued to work in [[Melbourne]], travelling to and from the home and store which the Chisholms had purchased in [[Kyneton]]. She joined her family there three years later. Archibald served as a magistrate during his time in Kyneton, and the two elder sons helped him run the store.\n\nDue to Chisholm's ill health, the family moved back to Sydney in 1858. Her health improved. At the end of 1859 and beginning of 1860, Chisholm gave four political lectures. She called for land to be allocated so that emigrant families could establish small farms. She believed such action would provide greater stability among the new settlers in the colonies. Chisholm also wrote a novella,  ''Little Joe,'' that was serialised in the local paper.<ref>Chisholm, Caroline, ed. by John Moran, ''Radical in Bonnet and Shawl: Four Political Lectures''; and ''Little Joe''. (Australia: Preferential Publications, 1994 and 1991)</ref>\n\nHer husband accompanied the younger children back to England in 1865. Archibald Jr. accompanied his mother on her return to England in 1866. Chisholm died in London, England on 25 March 1877, and her husband died in August that year. Five of their eight children survived their parents.\n\nChisholm's body was taken to her home town, Northampton, where it rested overnight in the [[Northampton Cathedral|Cathedral of Our Lady and St Thomas]]. She and her husband are buried in the same grave in [[Billing, Northamptonshire|Billing]] Road Cemetery.\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:Australian $5 note paper back.jpg|thumb|1967 [[Australian five-dollar note]] reverse featuring Chisholm]]\n[[File:ChisholmPlaque.jpg|thumb|Plaque at 32 Charlton Place, Islington, London]]\n[[File:Breadalbane Anglican Church 004.JPG|thumb|The Chisholm Memorial Church at [[Breadalbane, New South Wales]]]]\n[[File:Caroline Chisholm Centre entrance March 2013.jpg|thumb|Caroline Chisholm Centre in [[Tuggeranong]] (ACT)]]\nOn 32 Charlton Place, [[Islington]], London, a [[blue plaque]] commemorates Chisholm living there; it was erected in 1983 by Greater London Council.<ref>{{cite web|title=A-Z of Islington's Plaques |url=http://www.islington.gov.uk/islington/history-heritage/heritage_borough/bor_plaques/Pages/a_z_plaques.aspx |publisher=Islington Council |access-date=22 October 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141022153504/http://www.islington.gov.uk/islington/history-heritage/heritage_borough/bor_plaques/Pages/a_z_plaques.aspx |archivedate=22 October 2014 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\nThe Chisholm Memorial Church (St Silas' Anglican church) at [[Breadalbane, New South Wales]] was founded in 1937 and named for her.\n\n*A number of educational facilities in Australia and England have been named after Chisholm.<ref>[http://www.chisholm.wa.edu.au/ Chisholm Catholic College].

In 1922, it [[Treaty on the Creation of the USSR|joined]] other former territories of the empire to become the [[Soviet Union]]. After [[World War II]], the [[Soviet Army]] occupied much of Eastern Europe and helped establish communist states in these countries. Most communist states in Eastern Europe were [[Warsaw Pact|allied]] with the Soviet Union, except for [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] which declared itself [[Non-Aligned Movement|non-aligned]]. After a [[Second Sino-Japanese War|war against Japanese occupation]] and a [[Chinese Civil War|civil war]] resulting in a [[Communist Party of China|communist]] victory, the [[People's Republic of China]] was established in 1949. Communist states were also established in [[Cambodia]], [[Cuba]], [[Laos]] and [[Vietnam]]. A communist state was established in [[North Korea]], although it later adopted its own ideology called ''[[Juche]]''. In 1989, the communist states in Eastern Europe collapsed under public pressure during a [[Revolutions of 1989|wave of non-violent movements]] which led to the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991.\n\nToday, the existing communist states in the world are in China, Cuba, Laos and Vietnam. These communist states often do not claim to have achieved socialism or communism in their countries, but to be building and working toward the establishment of socialism in their countries. For example, the preamble to the [[Constitution of Vietnam|Socialist Republic of Vietnam's Constitution]] states that Vietnam only entered a transition stage between [[capitalism]] and [[socialism]] after the country was re-unified under the [[Communist Party of Vietnam|communist party]] in 1976<ref>[http://www.vietnamembassy-usa.org/learn_about_vietnam/politics/constitution/ \"VN Embassy - Constitution of 1992\"]. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110709162321/http://www.vietnamembassy-usa.org/learn_about_vietnam/politics/constitution/|date=9 July 2011}} Full Text. From the Preamble: \"On 2 July 1976, the National Assembly of reunified Vietnam decided to change the country's name to the Socialist Republic of Vietnam; the country entered a period of transition to socialism, strove for national construction, and unyieldingly defended its frontiers while fulfilling its internationalist duty\".</ref> and the [[Constitution of Cuba|1992 Constitution of the Republic of Cuba]] states that the role of the [[Communist Party of Cuba|communist party]] is to \"guide the common effort toward the goals and construction of socialism\".<ref>[http://www.cubanet.org/ref/dis/const_92_e.htm \"Cubanet - Constitution of the Republic of Cuba, 1992\"]. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110709122434/http://www.cubanet.org/ref/dis/const_92_e.htm|date=9 July 2011}} Full Text. From Article 5: \"The Communist Party of Cuba, a follower of Mart\u00ed's ideas and of Marxism-Leninism, and the organized vanguard of the Cuban nation, is the highest leading force of society and of the state, which organizes and guides the common effort toward the goals of the construction of socialism and the progress toward a communist society\".</ref>\n\n=== Institutions ===\nCommunist states share similar institutions which are organized on the premise that the [[communist party]] is a [[Vanguardism|vanguard of the proletariat]] and represents the long-term interests of the people. The doctrine of [[democratic centralism]], developed by [[Vladimir Lenin]] as a set of principles to be used in the internal affairs of the communist party, is extended to society at large.<ref name=\"Furtak, Robert K. 1986, pp. 8\u20139\">Furtak, Robert K. (1987). ''The Political Systems of the Socialist States''. New York City: St. Martin's Press. pp. 8\u20139.</ref> According to democratic centralism, all leaders must be elected by the people and all proposals must be debated openly, but once a decision has been reached all people have a duty to account to that decision. When used within a political party, democratic centralism is meant to prevent factionalism and splits. When applied to an entire state, democratic centralism creates a [[One-party state|one-party system]].<ref name=\"Furtak, Robert K. 1986, pp. 8\u20139\"/> The constitutions of most communist states describe their political system as a form of democracy.<ref>Furtak, Robert K. (1987). ''The Political Systems of the Socialist States''. New York City: St. Martin's Press. p. 12.</ref> They recognize the sovereignty of the people as embodied in a series of [[Representative democracy|representative]] parliamentary institutions. Such states do not have a [[separation of powers]] and instead have one national legislative body (such as the [[Supreme Soviet]] in the [[Soviet Union]]) which is considered the highest organ of state power and which is legally superior to the executive and judicial branches of government.<ref>Furtak, Robert K. (1987). ''The Political Systems of the Socialist States''. New York City: St. Martin's Press. p. 13.</ref>\n\nIn communist states, national legislative politics often has a similar structure to the parliaments that exist in [[Liberal democracy|liberal republics]], with two significant differences. First, the deputies elected to these national legislative bodies are not expected to represent the interests of any particular constituency, but rather the long-term interests of the people as a whole; and second, against [[Karl Marx]]'s advice, the legislative bodies of communist states are not in permanent session. Rather, they convene once or several times per year in sessions which usually last only a few days.<ref>Furtak, Robert K. (1987). ''The Political Systems of the Socialist States''. New York City: St. Martin's Press. p. 14.</ref> When the national legislative body is not in session, its powers are transferred to a smaller council (often called a [[presidium]]) which combines legislative and executive power and in some communist states (such as the Soviet Union before 1990) acts as a collective [[head of state]]. In some systems, the presidium is composed of important communist party members who vote the resolutions of the communist party into law.\n\nA feature of communist states is the existence of numerous state-sponsored social organizations ([[Club (organization)|associations]] of journalists, teachers, writers and other professionals, [[consumer cooperatives]], [[sports club]]s, [[trade union]]s, [[youth organization]]s and [[women's organization]]s) which are integrated into the political system. In communist states, the social organizations are expected to promote social unity and cohesion, to serve as a link between the government and society and to provide a forum for recruitment of new communist party members.<ref>Furtak, Robert K. (1987). ''The Political Systems of the Socialist States''. New York City: St. Martin's Press. pp. 16\u201317.</ref>\n\nHistorically, the political organization of many socialist states has been dominated by a one-party monopoly. Some communist governments such as those in [[List of political parties in the People's Republic of China|China]], [[National Front (Czechoslovakia)#1948\u20131990|Czechoslovakia]] or [[National Front (East Germany)|East Germany]] have or had more than one political party, but all minor parties are or were required to follow the leadership of the communist party. In communist states, the government may not tolerate criticism of policies that have already been implemented in the past or are being implemented in the present.<ref>Furtak, Robert K. (1987). ''The Political Systems of the Socialist States''. New York City: St. Martin's Press. pp. 18\u201319.</ref> Nevertheless, communist parties have won elections and governed in the context of [[Multi-party system|multi-party democracies]] without seeking to establish a one-party state and therefore these entities do not fall under the definition of communist state. In most of Europe, communist parties were highly popular and served in several coalition governments during the 20th century.

The state is not \"abolished\". It dies out\".{{sfn|Iman|1986|p=383}}\n\nThe introduction of the [[first five-year plan]] in the Soviet Union got many communists to believe that the withering away of the state was imminent.{{sfn|Guns|1950|p=188}} However, [[Joseph Stalin]] warned that the [[withering away of the state]] would not occur until after the [[socialism (Marxism)|socialist mode of production]] had achieved dominance over capitalism.{{sfn|Guns|1950|p=188}} Soviet jurist [[Andrey Vyshinsky]] echoed this assumption and said that the socialist state was necessary \"in order to defend, to secure, and to develop relationships and arrangements advantageous to the workers, and to annihilate completely capitalism and its remnants\".{{sfn|Guns|1950|pp=188\u2013189}}\n\nIdeology permeates these states.{{sfn|Tang|1980|p=43}} According to scholar Peter Tang, \"[t]he supreme test of whether a Communist Party-state remains revolutionarily dedicated or degenerates into a revisionist or counterrevolutionary system lies in its attitude toward the Communist ideology\".{{sfn|Tang|1980|p=41}} Therefore, the sole ideological purpose of communist states it to spread socialism and to reach that goal these states have to be guided by Marxism\u2013Leninism.{{sfn|Tang|1980|p=41}} The communist states have opted for two ways to achieve this goal, namely govern indirectly by Marxism\u2013Leninism through the party (Soviet model), or commit the state officially through the constitution to Marxism\u2013Leninism (Maoist China\u2013Albania model).{{sfn|Tang|1980|pp=42\u201343}} The Soviet model is the most common and is currently in use China.{{sfn|Tang|1980|p=42}}\n\nMarxism\u2013Leninism was mentioned in the [[Soviet constitution]].{{sfn|Tang|1980|p=43}} Article 6 of the [[1977 Soviet constitution]] stated: \"The Communist Party, armed with Marxism-Leninism, determines the general perspective of the development of society and the course of the domestic and foreign policy of the USSR\".{{sfn|Tang|1980|p=43}} This contrasts with the 1976 Albanian constitution which stated in Article 3: \"In the People's Socialist Republic of Albania the dominant ideology is Marxism-Leninism. The entire social order is developing on the basis of its principles\".{{sfn|Tang|1980|p=42}} The [[1975 Constitution of the People's Republic of China|1975 Chinese constitution]] had a similar tone, stating in Article 2 that \"Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought is the theoretical basis guiding the thinking of our nation\".{{sfn|Tang|1980|p=42}} The 1977 Soviet constitution did also use phrases such as \"building socialism and communism\", \"on the road to communism\", \"to build the material and technical basis of communism\" and \"to perfect socialist social relations and transform them into communist relations\" in the preamble.{{sfn|Tang|1980|p=43}}\n\n=== People's democratic state ===\nThe [[People's democracy (Marxism\u2013Leninism)|people's democratic state]] was implemented in Eastern Europe after [[World War II]].{{sfn|Skillings|1961|p=16}} It can be defined as a state and society in which feudal vestiges have been liquidated and where the system of private ownership exists, but it is eclipsed by the state-owned enterprises in the field of industry, transport and credit.{{sfn|Skillings|1961|p=21}}\n\nIn the words of [[Eugene Varga]], \"the state itself and its apparatus of violence serve the interests, not of the monopolistic bourgeoisie, but of the toilers of town and country\".{{sfn|Skillings|1961|p=21}} Soviet philosopher N. P. Farberov stated: \"People's democracy in the people's republics is a democracy of the toiling classes, headed by the working class, a broad and full democracy for the overwhelming majority of the people, that is, a socialist democracy in its character and its trend. In this sense we call it popular\".{{sfn|Skillings|1961|p=21}}\n\n=== People's republican state ===\nThe [[People's republic|people's republican state]] is a type of socialist state with a republican constitution. Although the term initially became associated with [[populist]] movements in the 19th century such as the German [[V\u00f6lkisch movement]] and the [[Narodniks]] in Russia, it is now associated to communist states. A number of the short-lived communist states which formed during [[World War I]] and [[Aftermath of World War I|its aftermath]] called themselves people's republics. Many of these sprang up in the territory of the former [[Russian Empire]] following the [[October Revolution]].<ref>{{cite book|title=How Ukraine Became a Market Economy and Democracy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C8C3xuqd6aMC|first=Anders|last=\u00c5slund|publisher=Peterson Institute|year=2009|isbn=9780881325461|page=12}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Miniature Empires: A Historical Dictionary of the Newly Independent States|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jwNeAgAAQBAJ|first=James|last=Minahan|publisher=Routledge|year=2013|isbn=9781135940102|page=296}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Power, Networks and Violent Conflict in Central Asia: A Comparison of Tajikistan and Uzbekistan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vv7pAwAAQBAJ|first=Idil|last=Tun\u00e7er-K\u0131lavuz|publisher=Routledge|year=2014|isbn=9781317805113|series=Routledge advances in Central Asian studies|volume=Volume 5|page=53}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Mongolic Elements in Tuvan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zddhapKVdHMC|first=Bayarma|last=Khabtagaeva|publisher=Otto Harrassowitz Verlag|year=2009|isbn=9783447060950|series=Turcologica Series|volume=Volume 81|page=21}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Peoples of Eastern Asia|volume=Volume 8: Mongolia\u2013Nepal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QXWjAmmZ5kMC|publisher=Marshall Cavendish|year=2004|first1=Fiona|last1=Macdonald|first2=Gillian|last2=Stacey|first3=Philip|last3=Steele|isbn=9780761475477|page=413}}</ref>\n\nAdditional people's republics emerged following the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] victory in World War II, mainly within the [[Soviet Union]]'s [[Eastern Bloc]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Democratisation and Institutional Reform in Albania|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l5FODwAAQBAJ|first=Elvin|last=Gjevori|publisher=Springer|year=2018|isbn=9783319730714|page=21}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Bulgaria in British Foreign Policy, 1943\u20131949|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iCw2DgAAQBAJ|first=Marietta|last=Stankova|publisher=Anthem Press|year=2014|series=Anthem Series on Russian, East European and Eurasian Studies|isbn=9781783082353|page=148}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Cabinets in Eastern Europe|doi=10.1057/9781403905215_6|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|editor-first1=Jean|editor-last1=Blondel|editor-first2=Ferdinand|editor-last2=M\u00fcller-Rommel|first1=Ferdinand|last1=M\u00fcller-Rommel|first2=Zdenka|last2=Mansfeldov\u00e1|chapter=Chapter 5: Czech Republic|year=2001|isbn=978-1-349-41148-1|page=62}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Labour Law in Hungary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L1Ra6WYtqsgC|first=J\u00f3zsef|last=Hajd\u00fa|publisher=Kluwer Law International|year=2011|isbn=9789041137920|page=27}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Legal Reform in Post-Communist Europe: The View from Within|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LAiYFR0MPXgC|first1=Stanis\u0142aw|last1=Frankowski|first2=Paul B.|last2=Stephan|publisher=Martinus Nijhoff|year=1995|isbn=9780792332183|page=23}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=NATO and Eastern Europe After 2000: Strategic Interactions with Poland, the Czech Republic, Romania, and Bulgaria|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PE_D8ZewHKQC|first=Laure|last=Paquette|publisher=Nova|year=2001|isbn=9781560729693|page=55}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Yugoslavia as History: Twice There Was a Country|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AZ1x7gvwx_8C|first=John R.|last=Lampe|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2000|isbn=9780521774017|page=233}}</ref> In Asia, [[China]] became a people's republic following the [[Chinese Communist Revolution]]<ref>{{cite web|title=The Chinese Revolution of 1949|url=https://history.state.gov/milestones/1945-1952/chinese-rev|website=Office of the Historian, Bureau of Public Affairs|publisher=United States Department of State}}</ref> and [[North Korea]] also became a people's republic.<ref>{{cite book|title=North Korea: The Politics of Regime Survival|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-EHfBQAAQBAJ|first1=Young Whan|last1=Kihl|first2=Hong Nack|last2= Kim|publisher=Routledge|year=2014|isbn=9781317463764|page=8}}</ref>\n\nDuring the 1960s, [[Socialist Republic of Romania|Romania]] and [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] ceased to use the term people's republic in their official name, replacing it with the term socialist republic as a mark of their ongoing political development.

National-democratic state ===\nThe concept of the national-democratic state tried to theorize how a state could develop socialism by bypassing the [[capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist mode of production]].{{sfn|Poelzer|1989|p=13}} While the theory of non-capitalist development was first articulated by [[Vladimir Lenin]], the novelty of this concept was applying it to the progressive elements of the [[national liberation movements]] in the [[Third World]].{{sfn|Poelzer|1989|p=13}} The term national-democratic state was introduced shortly after the [[Death and state funeral of Joseph Stalin|death of Stalin]], who believed colonies to be mere lackeys of Western imperialism and that the socialist movement few prospects there.{{sfn|Poelzer|1989|p=13}}\n\nThe countries in which the national liberations movements took power and which instituted an [[anti-imperialist]] foreign policy and sought to construct a form of socialism were considered as national-democratic states by Marxist\u2013Leninists.{{sfn|Poelzer|1989|p=13}} An example of a national-democratic state is Egypt under [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] which was committed to constructing [[Arab socialism]].{{sfn|Poelzer|1989|p=14}} With the exception of Cuba, none of these states managed to develop socialism.{{sfn|Poelzer|1989|p=14}} According to scholar Sylvia Woodby Edington, this might explain why the concept of the national-democratic state \"never received full theoretical elaboration as a political system\".{{sfn|Poelzer|1989|p=14}} However, one feature was clearly defined, namely that these states did not need to be led by a Marxist\u2013Leninist party.{{sfn|Poelzer|1989|p=16}}\n\n=== Socialist-oriented state ===\nA [[socialist-oriented state]] seeks to reach socialism by non-capitalist development.{{sfn|Poelzer|1989|p=15}} As a term, it is substantially different from the concept of the national-democratic state.{{sfn|Poelzer|1989|p=15}} The singular difference is that the socialist-oriented state was divided into two stages, firstly into a national-democratic socialist-oriented state and secondly into a people's democratic socialist-oriented state.{{sfn|Poelzer|1989|p=16}} Countries belonging to the national-democratic socialist-oriented state category were also categorised as national-democratic states.{{sfn|Poelzer|1989|p=16}} Examples of national-democratic socialist-oriented states are [[Algeria]] ruled by the [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|National Liberation Front]], [[Ba'athist Iraq]] and [[Socialist Burma]].{{sfn|Poelzer|1989|p=16}} In contrast, people's democratic socialist-oriented states had to be guided by Marxism\u2013Leninism and accept the universal truths of Marxism\u2013Leninism and reject other notions of socialism such as [[African socialism]].{{sfn|Poelzer|1989|p=16}}\n\nThe socialist-oriented states had seven defining features, namely they were revolutionary democracies, had a revolutionary-democratic party, class dictatorship, defense of the socialist-oriented states, had organs of socialisation, initiated socialist construction and the type of socialist-oriented state (either national-democratic or people's democratic).{{sfn|Poelzer|1989|p=22}} The political goal of [[revolutionary democracy]] is to create the conditions for socialism in countries were the social, political and economic conditions for socialism do not exist.{{sfn|Poelzer|1989|p=23}} The second feature to be met is the establishment of a revolutionary-democratic party which has to establish itself as the leading force and guide the state by using Marxist\u2013Leninist ideology.{{sfn|Poelzer|1989|p=24}} While introduced in these states, [[democratic centralism]] is rarely upheld.{{sfn|Poelzer|1989|p=25}}\n\nUnlike capitalism which is ruled by the bourgeoisie class and socialism were the proletariat leads, the socialist-oriented state represents a broad and heterogeneous group of classes that seek to consolidate national independence.{{sfn|Poelzer|1989|p=25}} Since the peasantry were usually the largest class in socialist-oriented states, their role were emphasised\u2014similar to the working class in other socialist states.{{sfn|Poelzer|1989|p=26}} However, Marxist\u2013Leninist admitted that these states often fell under the control of certain cliques such as the [[Derg|military in Ethiopia]].{{sfn|Poelzer|1989|p=26}} The establishing of a legal system and coercive institutions are also noted to safeguard the socialist-oriented nature of the state.{{sfn|Poelzer|1989|p=44}} The fifth feature is that the media and educational system has to be taken over by the socialist-oriented state while establishing mass organisations to mobilise the populace.{{sfn|Poelzer|1989|pp=50\u201352}} Unlike the Soviet economic model, the economy of the socialist-oriented states are [[mixed economies]] that seek to attract [[foreign capital]] and which seeks to maintain and develop the [[private sector]].{{sfn|Poelzer|1989|pp=54\u201355}} In the words of Soviet leader [[Leonid Brezhnev]], these states were in the process of taking over the [[commanding heights of the economy]] and instituting a state planned economy.{{sfn|Poelzer|1989|p=14}} According to Soviet sources, only Laos was the one socialist-oriented state that has managed to develop into a socialist state.{{sfn|Poelzer|1989|p=61}}\n\n=== Socialist state ===\nA [[socialist state]] is more than a form of government and can only exist in countries with a [[socialist economy]]. There are examples of several states that have instituted a socialist [[form of government]] before achieving socialism. The former socialist states of Eastern Europe were established as people's democracies (a developmental stage between [[capitalism]] and [[socialism]]). On the question of the Marxist\u2013Leninist ruled countries of Africa and the Middle East, the Soviet Union deemed none of them to be socialist states\u2014referring to them as socialist-oriented states. While many countries with constitutional references to socialism and countries ruled by long-standing socialist movements exist, within Marxist\u2013Leninist theory a socialist state is led by a [[communist party]] that has instituted a socialist economy in a given country.{{sfn|Harding|1981|p=27}} It deals with states that define themselves either as a socialist state or as a state led by a governing Marxist\u2013Leninist party in their constitutions. For this reason alone, these states are often called communist states.{{sfn|Wilczynski|2008|p=21|loc=Contrary to Western usage, these countries describe themselves as 'Socialist' (not 'Communist'). The second stage (Marx's 'higher phase'), or 'Communism' is to be marked by an age of plenty, distribution according to needs (not work), the absence of money and the market mechanism, the disappearance of the last vestiges of capitalism and the ultimate 'whithering away of the state'.}}{{sfn|Steele|1999|p=45|loc=Among Western journalists the term 'Communist' came to refer exclusively to regimes and movements associated with the Communist International and its offspring: regimes which insisted that they were not communist but socialist, and movements which were barely communist in any sense at all.}}{{sfn|Rosser|2003|p=14|loc=Ironically, the ideological father of communism, Karl Marx, claimed that communism entailed the withering away of the state. The dictatorship of the proletariat was to be a strictly temporary phenomenon. Well aware of this, the Soviet Communists never claimed to have achieved communism, always labeling their own system socialist rather than communist and viewing their system as in transition to communism.}}\n\n== Political system ==\n=== Government ===\nIn communist states, the highest administrative agency of state power is the government.{{sfn|Feldbrugge|1985|p=202}} It functions as the executive organ of the legislature.{{sfn|Feldbrugge|1985|p=202}} The [[Supreme Soviet]] has been introduced with variations in all communist states.{{sfn|White|Gardner|Sch\u00f6pflin|1987|p=86}} For most of its existence, the Soviet government was known as the [[Council of Ministers (Soviet Union)|Council of Ministers]]{{sfn|Feldbrugge|1985|p=202}} and identical names were used for the governments of [[People's Socialist Republic of Albania|Albania]], [[East Germany]], [[Hungarian People's Republic|Hungary]], [[Polish People's Republic|Poland]] and [[Socialist Republic of Romania|Romania]].{{sfn|Staar|1988|p=36 (Bulgaria), 65 (Czechoslovakia), 133 (Hungary), 161 (Romania), 195 (Poland).}} It was independent of the other central agencies such as the legislature and its presidium, but the Supreme Soviet was empowered to decide on all questions it wished.{{sfn|Feldbrugge|1985|pp=202\u2013203}} The Soviet government was responsible to the legislature and in between sessions of the legislature it reported to the legislature's standing committee.{{sfn|Feldbrugge|1985|p=203}} The standing committee could reorganise and hold the Soviet government accountable, but it could not instruct the government.{{sfn|Feldbrugge|1985|p=203}} The government was responsible for the overall economic system, public order, foreign relations and defense.{{sfn|Feldbrugge|1985|p=203}} The Soviet model was more or less identically implemented in [[People's Republic of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Czechoslovakia]], East Germany, Hungary, Poland and Romania, with few exceptions.{{sfn|Staar|1988|p=36 (Bulgaria), 65 (Czechoslovakia), 133 (Hungary), 161 (Romania), 195 (Poland).}} One exepction was Czechoslovakia, where it had a [[President of Czechoslovakia|president]] and not a collective presidency;{{sfn|Starr|1987|p=64}} and Bulgaria, where the State Council was empowered to instruct the Council of Ministers.{{sfn|Dimitrov|2006|p=170}}\n\n=== Legislature ===\n==== Powers and organisation ====\n[[File:Great Hall Of The People At Night.JPG|thumb|The meeting place of the Chinese [[National People's Congress]]]]\nAll state power is unified in the legislature in communist states.{{sfn|Hand|2016|p=2}} This is a firm rejection of the [[separation of power]]s found in liberal democracies.{{sfn|Hand|2016|p=2}} The constitution is passed by the legislature and can only be amended by the legislature.{{sfn|Hand|2016|p=2}} Judicial review and extra-parliamentary review were denounced by Soviet legal theorists as bourgeoisie institutions.{{sfn|Hand|2016|p=2}} They also perceived it as a limitation of the people's supreme power.{{sfn|Hand|2016|p=2}} The legislature together with its suborgans was responsible for overseeing the constitutional order.{{sfn|Hand|2016|p=2}} Since the legislature is the supreme judge of constitutionality, the legislature's own acts cannot, therefore, be unconstitutional.{{sfn|Hazard|1985|p=163}}\n\nThe [[Supreme Soviet]] was the first socialist legislature and the Soviet legislative system has been introduced in all communist states.{{sfn|White|Gardner|Sch\u00f6pflin|1987|p=86}} The Supreme Soviet convened twice a year, usually for two or three days each, making it one of the world's first frequently convened legislatures during its existence.{{sfn|White|Gardner|Sch\u00f6pflin|1987|p=91}} The same meeting frequency was the norm in the Eastern Bloc countries as well as modern-day China.{{sfn|White|Gardner|Sch\u00f6pflin|1987|pp=114\u2013115}} China's legislature, the [[National People's Congress]] (NPC) is modeled on the Soviet one.{{sfn|White|Gardner|Sch\u00f6pflin|1987|p=114}} As with the Soviet one, the NPC is the highest organ of the state and elects a [[Standing Committee of the National People's Congress|Standing Committee]] (the Soviets had a [[Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union|Presidium]]), the government and the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]] (the Soviet counterpart being the [[Council of Ministers (Soviet Union)|Council of Ministers]]).{{sfn|White|Gardner|Sch\u00f6pflin|1987|p=115}} In addition, all communist states the ruling party has either had a clear majority such as China, or held every seats as they did in the Soviet Union in their national legislature.{{sfn|White|Gardner|Sch\u00f6pflin|1987|p=82}}\n\nWestern researchers have devoted little attention to legislatures in communist states.{{sfn|Nelson|1982|p=1}} The reason being that there are not significant bodies of political socialization when compared to legislatures in liberal democracies.{{sfn|Nelson|1982|p=1}} While political leaders are often elected as members of socialist legislatures, these post are not relevant to political advancement.{{sfn|Nelson|1982|p=1}} The role of legislatures is different from country to country.{{sfn|Nelson|1982|p=1}} In the Soviet Union, the [[Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union|Supreme Soviet]] did \"little more than listen to statements from Soviet political leaders and to legitimate decisions already made elsewhere\" while in the legislatures of Poland, Vietnam and Yugoslavia it has been more active and had an impact on rule-making.{{sfn|Nelson|1982|p=1}}\n\n==== Representativity ====\nBoth Marx and Lenin abhorred the parliamentary systems of [[bourgeois democracy]], but neither of them sought to abolish it.{{sfn|Nelson|1982|p=7}} Lenin wrote that it would be impossible to develop [[proletarian democracy]] without \"without representative institutions\".{{sfn|Nelson|1982|p=7}} Both of them considered the governing model of the [[Paris Commune of 1871]] in which executive and legislative were combined in one body to be ideal.{{sfn|Nelson|1982|p=7}} More importantly, Marx applauded the election process by \"universial suffrage in the various wards and town\".{{sfn|Nelson|1982|p=7}} While the institution of the socialist legislature might not be important in itself, they \"have a place in the literature and rhetoric of the ruling parties which cannot be ignored\u2014in the language of the party's intimacy with working masses, of its alleged knowledge about interests of working people, of social justice and socialist democracy, of the [[mass line]] and learning from the people\".{{sfn|Nelson|1982|p=6}}\n\nBy having legislatures, the Marxist\u2013Leninist parties try to keep ideological consistency between supporting representative institutions and safeguarding the leading role of the party.{{sfn|Nelson|1982|p=7}} The seek to use the legislatures as a linkage between the rulers and the ruled.{{sfn|Nelson|1982|p=7}} These institutions are representative and usually mirror the population in areas such as [[ethnicity]] and [[language]], \"yet with occupations distributed in a manner skewed towards government officials\".{{sfn|Nelson|1982|p=7}} Unlike in liberal democracies, legislatures of communist states are not to act as a forum for conveying demands or interest articulation\u2014they meet too infrequently for this to be the case.{{sfn|Nelson|1982|p=8}} This might explain why communist states have not developed terms such as delegates and trustees to give legislature representatives to vote according to their best judgement or in the interest of their constituency.{{sfn|Nelson|1982|p=8}} Scholar Daniel Nelson has noted: \"As with the British parliament before the seventeenth-century turmoil secured its supremacy, legislative bodies in communist states physically portray the 'realm' ruled by (to stretch an anaology) 'kings'. Members of the assemblies 'represent' the population to whom the rulers speak and over whom they govern, convening a broader 'segment of society' [...] than the court itself\".{{sfn|Nelson|1982|p=8}} Despite this, it does not mean that the communist states use legislatures to strengthen their communication with the populace\u2014the party, rather than the legislature, could take that function.{{sfn|Nelson|1982|p=8}}\n\nIdeologically, it has another function, namely to prove that communist states do not only represent the interests of the working class, but all social strata.{{sfn|Nelson|1982|p=9}} Communist states are committed to establish a classless society and use legislatures to show that all social strata, whether bureaucrat, worker or intellectual, are committed and have interests in building such a society.{{sfn|Nelson|1982|p=9}} As is the case in China, national institutions such as the legislature \"must exist which brings together representatives of all nationalities and geographic areas\".{{sfn|Nelson|1982|p=9}} It does not matter if the legislatures only rubber stamp decisions because by having them it shows that communist states are committed to incorporate minorities and areas of the country by included them in the composition of the legislature.{{sfn|Nelson|1982|p=9}} In communist states, there is usually a high proportion of members who are government officials.{{sfn|Nelson|1982|p=10}} In this instance, it might mean that its less important what legislatures do and more important who its representatives are.{{sfn|Nelson|1982|p=10}} A member of a socialist legislature at central and local level is usually either a government or party official, leading figure in their community, or national figure outside the communist party.{{sfn|Nelson|1982|p=10}} This goes to show that legislatures are tools to garner popular support for the government in which leading figures campaign and spread information about the party's policies and ideological development.{{sfn|Nelson|1982|p=10}}\n\n=== Military ===\n==== Control ====\nCommunist states have established two types of civil-military systems. The armed forces of most socialist states have historically been state institutions based on the Soviet model,{{sfn|Kramer|1985|p=47}} but in China, Laos, North Korea and Vietnam the armed forces are party-state institutions. However, there are several differences between the statist (Soviet) model and the party-state model (China). In the Soviet model, the [[Soviet armed forces]] was led by the Council of Defense (an organ formed by the [[Presidium of the Supreme Soviet|Presidium]] of the [[Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union]]) while the Council of Ministers was responsible for formulating defense policies.{{sfn|Snyder|1987|p=28}} The party leader was ''[[ex officio]]'' the Chairman of the Council of Defense.{{sfn|Snyder|1987|p=28}} Below the Council of Defense, there was the Main Military Council which was responsible for the strategic direction and leadership of the Soviet armed forces.{{sfn|Snyder|1987|p=28}} The working organ of the Council of Defense was the General Staff which was tasked with analysing military and political situations as they developed.{{sfn|Snyder|1987|p=30}} The party controlled the armed forces through the Main Political Directorate (MPD) of the [[Ministry of Defense (Soviet Union)|Ministry of Defense]], a state organ that functioned \"with the authority of a department of the [[CPSU Central Committe]]\".{{sfn|Loeber|1984|p=13}} The MPD organised political indoctrination and created political control mechanism at the center to the company level in the field.{{sfn|Staff writer|1980|p=1}} Formally, the MPD was responsible for organising party and [[Komsomol]] organs as well as subordinate organs within the armed forces; ensuring that the party and state retains control over the armed forces; evaluates the political performance of officers; supervising the ideological content of the military press; and supervising the political-military training institutes and their ideological content.{{sfn|Staff writer|1980|p=1}} The head of the MPD was ranked fourth in military protocol, but it was not a member of the Council of Defense.{{sfn|Staff writer|1980|p=3}} The Administrative Organs Department of the CPSU Central Committee was responsible for implementing the party personnel policies and supervised the [[KGB]], the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the Ministry of Defense.{{sfn|Kokoshin|2016|p=19}}\n\nIn the Chinese party-state model, the [[People's Liberation Army]] (PLA) is a party institution.{{sfn|Mulvenon|2018|p=3}} In the preamble of the [[Constitution of the Communist Party of China]], it is stated: \"The [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC) shall uphold its absolute leadership over the People's Liberation Army and other people's armed forces\".{{sfn|Mulvenon|2018|p=3}} The PLA carries out its work in accordance with the instructions of the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of China|CPSU Central Committe]].{{sfn|Mulvenon|2012|p=251}} [[Mao Zedong]] described the PLA's institutional situation as follows: \"Every communist must grasp the truth, '[[Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun]]'. Our principle is that the party commands the gun, and the gun must never be allowed to command the Party\".{{sfn|Blasko|2006|p=6}} The [[Central Military Commission (China)|Central Military Commission]] (CMC) is both an organ of the state and the party\u2014it is an organ of the CPC Central Committee and an organ of the national legislature, the National People's Congress.{{sfn|Blasko|2006|p=27}} The [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|CPC General Secretary]] is ''ex officio'' [[Chairman of the Central Military Commission|party CMC Chairman]] and the [[President of the People's Republic of China]] is by right state CMC Chairman.{{sfn|Blasko|2006|p=27}} The composition of the party CMC and the state CMC are identical.{{sfn|Blasko|2006|p=27}} The CMC is responsible for the command of the PLA and determines national defense policies.{{sfn|Blasko|2006|p=27}} There are fifteen departments that report directly to the CMC and that are responsible for everything from political work to administration of the PLA.<ref name=\"rand\">{{cite web|url=https://www.rand.org/blog/2016/09/pla-reforms-and-their-ramifications.html|title=People's Liberation Army Reforms and Their Ramifications|last=Garafola|first=Cristina L.|publisher=[[RAND Corporation]]|date=23 September 2016|accessdate=27 December 2019}}</ref> Of significance is that the CMC eclipses by far the prerogatives of the CPSU Administrative Organs Department while the Chinese counterpart to the Main Political Directorate supervises not only the military, but also intelligence, the security services and counterespionage work.{{sfn|Kokoshin|2016|p=23}}\n\n==== Representation ====\nUnlike in liberal democracies, active military personnel are members and partake in civilian institutions of governance.{{sfn|Staff writer|1980|p=7}} This is the case in all communist states.{{sfn|Staff writer|1980|p=7}} For instance, the [[Communist Party of Vietnam]] (CPV) has elected at least one active military figure to its [[Politburo of the Communist Party of Vietnam|CPV Politburo]] since 1986.{{sfn|Thayer|2008|p=68}} In the 1986\u20132006 period, active military figures sitting in the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of Vietnam|CPV Central Committee]] stood at an average of 9,2 percent.{{sfn|Thayer|2008|p=68}} Military figures are also represented in the national legislature (the [[National Assembly of Vietnam|National Assembly]]) and other representative institutions.{{sfn|Thayer|2008|p=68}} In China, the two [[Vice Chairman of the Central Military Commission|CMC vice chairmen]] have had by right office seats in the [[Politburo of the Communist Party of China|CPC Politburo]] since 1987.{{sfn|Miller|2018|p=4}}\n\n=== Ruling party ===\n==== Leading role ====\nEvery communist state has been led by a Marxist\u2013Leninist party.{{sfn|Harding|1981|p=27}} This party seeks to represent and articulate the interests of the classes exploited by [[capitalism]].{{sfn|Harding|1981|p=27}} It seeks to lead the exploited classes to achieve communism.{{sfn|Harding|1981|p=27}} However, the party cannot be identified with the exploited class in general.{{sfn|Harding|1981|p=27}} Its membership is composed of members with advanced consciousness who are above sectional interests.{{sfn|Harding|1981|p=27}} Therefore, the party represents the advanced section of the exploited classes and through them leads the exploited classes by interpreting the universal laws governing human history towards communism.{{sfn|Harding|1981|pp=27\u201328}} \n\nIn ''[[Foundations of Leninism]]'' (1924), [[Joseph Stalin]] wrote that \"the proletariat [working class] needs the Party first of all as its General Staff, which it must have for the successful seizure of power. [...] But the proletariat needs the Party not only to achieve the [class] dictatorship; it needs it still more to maintain the [class] dictatorship\".{{sfn|Steiner|1951|p=58}} The current [[Constitution of Vietnam]] states in Article 4 that \"[t]he [[Communist Party of Vietnam]], the vanguard of the Vietnamese working class, simultaneously the vanguard of the toiling people and of the Vietnamese nation, the faithful representative of the interests of the working class, the toiling people, and the whole nation, acting upon the Marxist\u2013Leninist doctrine and [[Ho Chi Minh]]'s thought, is the leading force of the state and society\".{{sfn|Bui|2016|p=223}} In a similar form, the [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC) describes itself as \"the vanguard of the Chinese working class, the Chinese people, and the Chinese nation\".{{sfn|Li|2017|p=219}} As noted by both communist parties, the ruling parties of communist states are [[vanguard parties]]. [[Vladimir Lenin]] theorised that vanguard parties were \"capable of assuming power and leading the whole people to socialism, of directing and organising the new system, of being the teacher, the guide, the leader of all the working and exploited people in organizing their social life without the bourgeoisie\".{{sfn|Evans|1993|p=20}} This idea eventually evolved into the concept of the party's leading role in leading the state{{sfn|Evans|1993|p=20}} as seen in the CPC's self-description and Vietnam's constitution.{{sfn|Bui|2016|p=223}}{{sfn|Li|2017|p=219}}\n\n==== Internal organization ====\nThe Marxist\u2013Leninist governing party organises itself around the principle of [[democratic centralism]] and through it the state too.{{sfn|White|Gardner|Sch\u00f6pflin|1987|p=131}} It means that all directing bodies of the party, from top to bottom, shall be elected; that party bodies shall give periodical accounts of their activities to their respective party organizations; that there shall be strict party discipline and the subordination of the minority to the majority; and that all decisions of higher bodies shall be absolutely binding on lower bodies and on all party members.{{sfn|White|Gardner|Sch\u00f6pflin|1987|p=131}}\n\nThe highest organ of a Marxist\u2013Leninist governing party is the party congress.<ref name=\"CConly\">{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Central-Committee-Soviet-political-body|title=Central Committee|encyclopedia=[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]|accessdate=26 December 2019}}</ref> The congress elects the central committee and either an auditing commission and a control commission, or both, although not always.<ref name=\"CConly\"/> The central committee is the party's highest decision-making organ in between party congresses and elects a politburo and a secretariat amongst its members as well as the party's leader.<ref name=\"CConly\"/> When the central committee is not in session, the politburo is the highest decision-making organ of the party and the secretariat is the highest administrative organ.<ref name=\"CConly\"/> In certain parties, either the central committee or the politburo elects amongst its members a standing committee of the politburo which acts as the highest decision-making organ in between sessions of the politburo, central committee and the congress. This leadership structure is identical all the way down to the primary party organisation of the ruling party.<ref name=\"CConly\"/>\n\n== Economic system ==\nFrom reading their works, many followers of [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] drew the idea that the socialist economy would be based on planning and not market mechanism.{{sfn|Ellman|2014|pp=1\u20132}} These ideas later developed into the belief that planning was superior to market mechanism.{{sfn|Ellman|2014|p=2}} Upon seizing power, the [[Bolsheviks]] began advocating a national state planning system.{{sfn|Ellman|2014|p=2}} The [[8th Congress of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks)]] resolved to institute \"the maximum centralisation of production [...] simultaneously striving to establish a unified economic plan\".{{sfn|Ellman|2014|p=2}} The [[Gosplan]], the State Planning Commission, the [[Supreme Soviet of the National Economy]] and other central planning organs were established during the 1920s in the era of the [[New Economic Policy]].{{sfn|Ellman|2014|p=9}} On introducing the planning system, it became common belief in the international communist movement that the Soviet planning system was a more advanced form of economic organization then capitalism.{{sfn|Ellman|2014|p=11}} This led to the system being introduced voluntary in countries such as China, Cuba and Vietnam and in some cases imposed by the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Ellman|2014|p=11}}\n\nIn communist states, the [[Soviet-type economic planning|state planning]] system had five main characteristics.{{sfn|Ellman|2014|p=22}} Firstly, with the exception of the field consumption and employment, practically all decisions were centralized at the top.{{sfn|Ellman|2014|p=22}} Secondly, the system was [[Hierarchy|hierarchical]]\u2014the center formulated a plan that was sent down to the level below which would imitate the process and send the plan further down the pyramid.{{sfn|Ellman|2014|p=22}} Thirdly, the plans were binding in nature, i.e. everyone had to follow and meet the goals set forth in it.{{sfn|Ellman|2014|p=22}} Fourtly, the predominace of calculating in physical terms to ensure planned allocation of commodities were not incompatible with planned production.{{sfn|Ellman|2014|p=22}} Finally, money played a passive role within the state sector since the planners focused on physical allocation.{{sfn|Ellman|2014|p=22}}\n\nAccording to Michael Ellman, in a [[planned economy]] \"the state owns the land and all other natural resources and all characteristics of the traditional model the enterprises and their productive assets. Collective ownership (e.g. the property of collective farms) also exists, but plays a subsidiary role, and is expected to be temporary\".{{sfn|Ellman|2014|p=22}} The [[private ownership]] of the means of production still exist, although it plays a fairly smaller role.{{sfn|Ellman|2014|p=23}} Since the class struggle in capitalism is caused by the division between owners of the means of production and the workers who sell their labour, [[state ownership]] (defined as the property of the people in these systems) is considering as a tool to end class struggle and to empower the working class.{{sfn|Ellman|2014|p=25}}\n\n== Judicial system ==\n=== Constitution ===\n==== Role of constitutions ====\n[[Marxism\u2013Leninism|Marxist\u2013Leninists]] view the [[constitution]] as a [[Organic law|fundamental law]] and as an instrument of force.{{sfn|Chang|1956|p=520}} The constitution is the source of law and legality.{{sfn|Chang|1956|p=521}} Unlike in [[liberal democracies]], the Marxist\u2013Leninist constitution is not a framework to limit the power of the state.{{sfn|Chang|1956|p=521}} To the contrary, a Marxist\u2013Leninist constitution seeks to empower the state\u2014believing the state to be an organ of class domination and law to be the expression of the interests of the dominant class.{{sfn|Chang|1956|p=521}} It is the belief of Marxist\u2013Leninists that all national constitutions do this to ensure that countries can strengthen and enforce their own class system.{{sfn|Chang|1956|p=521}} In this instance, it means that Marxist\u2013Leninists conceive of constitutions as a tool to defend the socialist nature of the state and attack its enemies.{{sfn|Chang|1956|p=521}} This contrasts with the liberal conception of [[constitutionalism]] that \"law, rather than men, is supreme\".{{sfn|Chang|1956|p=xi}}\n\nUnlike the fixed nature of liberal democratic constitutions, a Marxist\u2013Leninist constitution is ever-changing.{{sfn|Chang|1956|p=522}} [[Andrey Vyshinsky]], a [[Procurator General of the Soviet Union]] during the 1930s, notes that the \"Soviet constitutions represent the sum total of the historic path along which the Soviet state has traveled. At the same time, they are the legislative basis of subsequent development of state life\".{{sfn|Chang|1956|p=522}} That is, the constitution sums up what already has been achieved.{{sfn|Chang|1956|p=xii}} This belief is also shared by the [[Communist Party of China]] which argued that \"the Chinese Constitution blazes a path for China, recording what has been won in China and what is yet to be conquered\".{{sfn|Chang|1956|p=522}} A constitution in a communist state has an end.{{sfn|Chang|1956|p=524}} For instance, the preamble of the [[1954 Constitution of the People's Republic of China|1954 Chinese constitution]] outlines the historical tasks of the Chinese communists, \"step by step, to bring about the [[Socialism (Marxism)|socialist industrialisation of the country]] and, step by step, to accomplish the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicraft and [[capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist industry and commerce]]\".{{sfn|Chang|1956|p=524}}\n\nIn communist states, the constitution was a tool to analyse the development of society.{{sfn|Triska|1968|p=xii}} The Marxist\u2013Leninist party in question would have to study the correlation of forces, literally society's class structure, before enacting changes.{{sfn|Triska|1968|p=xii}} Several terms were coined for different developmental states by Marxist\u2013Leninists legal theorists, including [[New Democracy|new democracy]], [[People's democracy (Marxism\u2013Leninism)|people's democracy]] and the [[primary stage of socialism]].{{sfn|Chang|1956|p=xii}} This is also why amendments to constitutions are not enough and major societal changes need a constitution which corresponds with the reality of the new class structure.{{sfn|Chang|1956|p=xii}}\n\nWith [[Nikita Khrushchev]]'s [[On the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences|repudiation of Stalin's practices]] and the [[Communist Party of China]]'s repudiation of certain [[Maoist]] policies, Marxist\u2013Leninist legal theories began to emphasise \"the formal, formerly neglected constitutional order\".{{sfn|Chang|1956|p=xiii}} [[Deng Xiaoping]], not long after [[Chairman of the Communist Party of China|Chairman]] [[Mao Zedong]] 's death, noted that \"[d]emocracy has to be institutionalised and written into law, so as to make sure that institutions and laws do not change whenever the leadership changes or whenever the leaders change their views. [...] The trouble now is that our legal system is incomplete. [...] Very often what leaders say is taken as law and anyone who disagrees is called a lawbreaker\".{{sfn|Keith|1992|p=112}} In 1986, Li Buyan wrote that \"the policies of the Party usually are regulations and calls which to a certain extent are only principles. The law is different; it is rigorously standardised. It explicitly and concretely stipulates what the people should, can or cannot do\".{{sfn|Keith|1992|p=114}} These legal developments have been echoed in later years in Cuba, Laos and Vietnam. This has led to the development of the communist concept of socialist rule of law which runs parallel to and is disctint to the [[Rule of law|liberal term]] of the same name.{{sfn|Keith|1992|p=118}} In the last years, this emphasization on the constitution as both a legal document and a paper which documents society's development has been noted by [[Communist Party of China|Chinese Communist Party]] [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|general secretary]] [[Xi Jinping]], who stated in 2013 that \"[n]o organisation or individual has the privilege to overstep the Constitution and law\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2013/06/03/chinas-constitution-debate-hits-a-sensitive-nerve/|title=China's constitution debate hits a sensitive nerve|last1=Wan|first1=William|last2=Qi|first2=Li|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=3 June 2013|accessdate=27 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n==== Constitutional supervision ====\nAfter [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Soviet Union]] [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|general secretary]] [[Joseph Stalin]]'s death, several communist states have experimented with some sort of constitutional supervision.{{sfn|Hand|2016|p=3}} These organs were designed to safeguard the supreme power of the legislature.{{sfn|Hand|2016|p=3}} [[Socialist Republic of Romania|Romania]] was the first to experiment with constitutional supervision when it established a Constitutional Committee in 1965.{{sfn|Hand|2016|p=3}} It was elected by the legislature and leading jurists sat in the committee, but it was only empowered to advice the legislature.{{sfn|Hand|2016|p=3}} Keith Hand has commented that \"[i]t was not an effective institution in practice\".{{sfn|Hand|2016|p=3}} \n\n[[Hungarian People's Republic|Hungary]] and [[Polish People's Republic|Poland]] experimented with constitutional supervision in the early 1980s.{{sfn|Hand|2016|p=3}} Hungary established the Council of Constitutional Law which was elected by the legislature and consisted of several leading jurists.{{sfn|Hand|2016|p=3}} It was empowered to review the constitutionality and legality of statutes, administrative regulations and other normative documents; however, if the agency in question failed to heed its advice, it needed to petition the legislature.{{sfn|Hand|2016|p=3}} In 1989, the Soviets established the Constitutional Supervision Committee which \"was subordinate only to the USSR constitution\".{{sfn|Hand|2016|p=4}} It was empowered \"to review the constitutionality and legality of a range of state acts of the USSR and its republics. Its jurisdiction included laws [passed by the legislature], decrees of the Supreme Soviet\u2019s Presidium, union republic constitutions and laws, some central administrative decrees, Supreme Court explanations, and other central normative documents\".{{sfn|Hand|2016|p=4}} If the committee deemed the legislature to have breached legality, the legislature was obliged to discuss the issue, but it could reject it if more than two-thirds voted against the findings of the Constitutional Supervision Committee.{{sfn|Hand|2016|p=4}} While it was constitutionally powerful, it lacked enforcement powers, it was often ignored and it failed to defend the constitution during the [[1991 Soviet coup d'\u00e9tat attempt|coup]] against [[Mikhail Gorbachev]].{{sfn|Hand|2016|p=5}} \n\nThe [[Generations of Chinese leadership|Chinese leadership]] has argued against establishing a constitutional supervisory committee due to their association with failed communist states of Europe.{{sfn|Hand|2016|p=15}} None of the surviving communist states (China, Cuba, Laos and Vietnam) have experimented with constitutional supervision committees or constitutional supervision of anykind outside the existing framework.{{sfn|Hand|2016|p=16}}\n\n=== Legal system ===\n{{main|Socialist law}}\nAll communist states have been established in countries with a [[civil law system]].{{sfn|Quigley|1989|p=781}} The countries of Eastern Europe had formally been governed by the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]], [[German Empire]] and [[Russian Empire]]\u2014all of whom had civil law legal system.{{sfn|Quigley|1989|p=781}} Cuba had a civil law system imposed on them by Spain while China introduced civil law to overlay with Confucian elements and Vietnam used French law.{{sfn|Quigley|1989|p=781}} Since the establishment of the Soviet Union, there has been a scholarly debate on whether [[socialist law]] is a separate legal system or is a part of the civil law tradition.{{sfn|Quigley|1989|p=781}} Legal scholar Ren\u00e8 David wrote that the socialist legal system \"possesses, in relation to our French law, particular features that give it a complete originality, to the extent that it is no longer possible to connect it, like the former Russian law, to the system of [[Roman law]]\".{{sfn|Quigley|1989|p=782}} Similarly, Christoper Osakwe concludes that socialist law is \"an autonomous legal system to be essentially distinguished from the other contemporary families of law\".{{sfn|Quigley|1989|p=783}} Proponents of socialist law as a separate legal system, have identified the following features:{{sfn|Quigley|1989|p=783}}\n# The socialist law is to disappear with the [[withering away of the state]].{{sfn|Quigley|1989|p=783}}\n# The rule of the Marxist\u2013Leninist party.{{sfn|Quigley|1989|p=783}}\n# The socialist law is subordinate and reflect changes to the economic order (the absorption of [[private law]] by [[public law]]).{{sfn|Quigley|1989|p=783}}\n# The socialist law has a religious character.{{sfn|Quigley|1989|p=784}}\n# The socialist law is [[prerogative]] rather than [[normative]].{{sfn|Quigley|1989|p=784}}\n\nLegal officials argue differently for their case than Westerners.{{sfn|Quigley|1989|p=796}} For instance, \"[t]he predominant view among Soviet jurists in the 1920s was that Soviet law of that period was Western-style law appropriate for a Soviet economy that remained capitalist to a significant degree\".{{sfn|Quigley|1989|p=796}} This changed with the introduction of the [[planned economy]] and the term socialist law was conceived to reflect this in the 1930s.{{sfn|Quigley|1989|p=796}} Hungarian legal theorist Imre Szab\u00f3 acknowledged similarities between socialist law and civil law, but he noted that \"four basic types of law may be distinguished: the laws of the slave, feudal, capitalist and socialist societies\".{{sfn|Quigley|1989|pp=798\u201399}} Using the Marxst theory of [[historical materialism]], Szab\u00f3 argues that socialist law cannot belong to the same law family since the material structure is different  from the capitalist countries as their superstructure (state) has to reflect these differences.{{sfn|Quigley|1989|p=799}} In other words, law is a tool by the [[ruling class]] to govern.{{sfn|Quigley|1989|p=799}} As Ren\u00e8 David notes, socialist jurists \"isolate their law, to put into another category, a reprobate category, the Romanist laws and the common law, is the fact that they reason less as jurists and more as philosophers and Marxists; it is in taking a not strictly legal viewpoint that they affirm the originality of their socialist law\".{{sfn|Quigley|1989|p=797}} However, some socialist legal theorists such as Romanian jurist Victor Zlatescu differentiated between type of law and family of law. According to Zlatescu, \"[t]he distinction between the law of the socialist countries and the law of the capitalist countries is not of the same nature as the difference between Roman-German law and the common law, for example. Socialist law is not a third family among the others, as appears in certain writings of Western comparatists\".{{sfn|Quigley|1989|p=800}} In other words, socialist law is civil law, but it is a different type of law for a different type of society.{{sfn|Quigley|1989|p=800}}\n\nYugoslav jurist Borislav Blagojevic noted that a \"great number of legal institutions and legal relations remain the same in socialist law\", further stating that it is \"necessary and justified\" to put them to use if they are \"in conformity with the corresponding interests of the ruling class in the state in question\".{{sfn|Quigley|1989|p=802}} Importantly, socialist law has retained civil law institutions, methodology and organization.{{sfn|Quigley|1989|p=803}} This can be discerned by the fact that [[East Germany]] retained the [[1896 German civil code]] until 1976 while [[Polish People's Republic|Poland]] used existing Austrian, French, German and Russian civil codes until its adoption of its own civil code in 1964.{{sfn|Quigley|1989|p=801}} Scholar John Quigley wrote that \"[s]ocialist law retains the inquisitorial style of trial, law-creation predominantly by legislatures rather than courts, and a significant role for legal scholarship in construing codes\".{{sfn|Quigley|1989|p=803}}\n\n== List of communist states ==\n=== Current communist states ===\nThe following countries are one-party states in which the institutions of the ruling communist party and the state have become intertwined.

In 1922, it [[Treaty on the Creation of the USSR|joined]] other former territories of the empire to become the [[Soviet Union]]. After [[World War II]], the [[Soviet Army]] occupied much of Eastern Europe and helped establish communist states in these countries. Most communist states in Eastern Europe were [[Warsaw Pact|allied]] with the Soviet Union, except for [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] which declared itself [[Non-Aligned Movement|non-aligned]]. After a [[Second Sino-Japanese War|war against Japanese occupation]] and a [[Chinese Civil War|civil war]] resulting in a [[Communist Party of China|communist]] victory, the [[People's Republic of China]] was established in 1949. Communist states were also established in [[Cambodia]], [[Cuba]], [[Laos]] and [[Vietnam]]. A communist state was established in [[North Korea]], although it later adopted its own ideology called ''[[Juche]]''. In 1989, the communist states in Eastern Europe collapsed under public pressure during a [[Revolutions of 1989|wave of non-violent movements]] which led to the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991.\n\nToday, the existing communist states in the world are in China, Cuba, Laos and Vietnam. These communist states often do not claim to have achieved socialism or communism in their countries, but to be building and working toward the establishment of socialism in their countries. For example, the preamble to the [[Constitution of Vietnam|Socialist Republic of Vietnam's Constitution]] states that Vietnam only entered a transition stage between [[capitalism]] and [[socialism]] after the country was re-unified under the [[Communist Party of Vietnam|communist party]] in 1976<ref>[http://www.vietnamembassy-usa.org/learn_about_vietnam/politics/constitution/ \"VN Embassy - Constitution of 1992\"]. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110709162321/http://www.vietnamembassy-usa.org/learn_about_vietnam/politics/constitution/|date=9 July 2011}} Full Text. From the Preamble: \"On 2 July 1976, the National Assembly of reunified Vietnam decided to change the country's name to the Socialist Republic of Vietnam; the country entered a period of transition to socialism, strove for national construction, and unyieldingly defended its frontiers while fulfilling its internationalist duty\".</ref> and the [[Constitution of Cuba|1992 Constitution of the Republic of Cuba]] states that the role of the [[Communist Party of Cuba|communist party]] is to \"guide the common effort toward the goals and construction of socialism\".<ref>[http://www.cubanet.org/ref/dis/const_92_e.htm \"Cubanet - Constitution of the Republic of Cuba, 1992\"]. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110709122434/http://www.cubanet.org/ref/dis/const_92_e.htm|date=9 July 2011}} Full Text. From Article 5: \"The Communist Party of Cuba, a follower of Mart\u00ed's ideas and of Marxism-Leninism, and the organized vanguard of the Cuban nation, is the highest leading force of society and of the state, which organizes and guides the common effort toward the goals of the construction of socialism and the progress toward a communist society\".</ref>\n\n=== Institutions ===\nCommunist states share similar institutions which are organized on the premise that the [[communist party]] is a [[Vanguardism|vanguard of the proletariat]] and represents the long-term interests of the people. The doctrine of [[democratic centralism]], developed by [[Vladimir Lenin]] as a set of principles to be used in the internal affairs of the communist party, is extended to society at large.<ref name=\"Furtak, Robert K. 1986, pp. 8\u20139\">Furtak, Robert K. (1987). ''The Political Systems of the Socialist States''. New York City: St. Martin's Press. pp. 8\u20139.</ref> According to democratic centralism, all leaders must be elected by the people and all proposals must be debated openly, but once a decision has been reached all people have a duty to account to that decision. When used within a political party, democratic centralism is meant to prevent factionalism and splits. When applied to an entire state, democratic centralism creates a [[One-party state|one-party system]].<ref name=\"Furtak, Robert K. 1986, pp. 8\u20139\"/> The constitutions of most communist states describe their political system as a form of democracy.<ref>Furtak, Robert K. (1987). ''The Political Systems of the Socialist States''. New York City: St. Martin's Press. p. 12.</ref> They recognize the sovereignty of the people as embodied in a series of [[Representative democracy|representative]] parliamentary institutions. Such states do not have a [[separation of powers]] and instead have one national legislative body (such as the [[Supreme Soviet]] in the [[Soviet Union]]) which is considered the highest organ of state power and which is legally superior to the executive and judicial branches of government.<ref>Furtak, Robert K. (1987). ''The Political Systems of the Socialist States''. New York City: St. Martin's Press. p. 13.</ref>\n\nIn communist states, national legislative politics often has a similar structure to the parliaments that exist in [[Liberal democracy|liberal republics]], with two significant differences. First, the deputies elected to these national legislative bodies are not expected to represent the interests of any particular constituency, but rather the long-term interests of the people as a whole; and second, against [[Karl Marx]]'s advice, the legislative bodies of communist states are not in permanent session. Rather, they convene once or several times per year in sessions which usually last only a few days.<ref>Furtak, Robert K. (1987). ''The Political Systems of the Socialist States''. New York City: St. Martin's Press. p. 14.</ref> When the national legislative body is not in session, its powers are transferred to a smaller council (often called a [[presidium]]) which combines legislative and executive power and in some communist states (such as the Soviet Union before 1990) acts as a collective [[head of state]]. In some systems, the presidium is composed of important communist party members who vote the resolutions of the communist party into law.\n\nA feature of communist states is the existence of numerous state-sponsored social organizations ([[Club (organization)|associations]] of journalists, teachers, writers and other professionals, [[consumer cooperatives]], [[sports club]]s, [[trade union]]s, [[youth organization]]s and [[women's organization]]s) which are integrated into the political system. In communist states, the social organizations are expected to promote social unity and cohesion, to serve as a link between the government and society and to provide a forum for recruitment of new communist party members.<ref>Furtak, Robert K. (1987). ''The Political Systems of the Socialist States''. New York City: St. Martin's Press. pp. 16\u201317.</ref>\n\nHistorically, the political organization of many socialist states has been dominated by a one-party monopoly. Some communist governments such as those in [[List of political parties in the People's Republic of China|China]], [[National Front (Czechoslovakia)#1948\u20131990|Czechoslovakia]] or [[National Front (East Germany)|East Germany]] have or had more than one political party, but all minor parties are or were required to follow the leadership of the communist party. In communist states, the government may not tolerate criticism of policies that have already been implemented in the past or are being implemented in the present.<ref>Furtak, Robert K. (1987). ''The Political Systems of the Socialist States''. New York City: St. Martin's Press. pp. 18\u201319.</ref> Nevertheless, communist parties have won elections and governed in the context of [[Multi-party system|multi-party democracies]] without seeking to establish a one-party state and therefore these entities do not fall under the definition of communist state. In most of Europe, communist parties were highly popular and served in several coalition governments during the 20th century.

The state is not \"abolished\". It dies out\".{{sfn|Iman|1986|p=383}}\n\nThe introduction of the [[first five-year plan]] in the Soviet Union got many communists to believe that the withering away of the state was imminent.{{sfn|Guns|1950|p=188}} However, [[Joseph Stalin]] warned that the [[withering away of the state]] would not occur until after the [[socialism (Marxism)|socialist mode of production]] had achieved dominance over capitalism.{{sfn|Guns|1950|p=188}} Soviet jurist [[Andrey Vyshinsky]] echoed this assumption and said that the socialist state was necessary \"in order to defend, to secure, and to develop relationships and arrangements advantageous to the workers, and to annihilate completely capitalism and its remnants\".{{sfn|Guns|1950|pp=188\u2013189}}\n\nIdeology permeates these states.{{sfn|Tang|1980|p=43}} According to scholar Peter Tang, \"[t]he supreme test of whether a Communist Party-state remains revolutionarily dedicated or degenerates into a revisionist or counterrevolutionary system lies in its attitude toward the Communist ideology\".{{sfn|Tang|1980|p=41}} Therefore, the sole ideological purpose of communist states it to spread socialism and to reach that goal these states have to be guided by Marxism\u2013Leninism.{{sfn|Tang|1980|p=41}} The communist states have opted for two ways to achieve this goal, namely govern indirectly by Marxism\u2013Leninism through the party (Soviet model), or commit the state officially through the constitution to Marxism\u2013Leninism (Maoist China\u2013Albania model).{{sfn|Tang|1980|pp=42\u201343}} The Soviet model is the most common and is currently in use China.{{sfn|Tang|1980|p=42}}\n\nMarxism\u2013Leninism was mentioned in the [[Soviet constitution]].{{sfn|Tang|1980|p=43}} Article 6 of the [[1977 Soviet constitution]] stated: \"The Communist Party, armed with Marxism-Leninism, determines the general perspective of the development of society and the course of the domestic and foreign policy of the USSR\".{{sfn|Tang|1980|p=43}} This contrasts with the 1976 Albanian constitution which stated in Article 3: \"In the People's Socialist Republic of Albania the dominant ideology is Marxism-Leninism. The entire social order is developing on the basis of its principles\".{{sfn|Tang|1980|p=42}} The [[1975 Constitution of the People's Republic of China|1975 Chinese constitution]] had a similar tone, stating in Article 2 that \"Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought is the theoretical basis guiding the thinking of our nation\".{{sfn|Tang|1980|p=42}} The 1977 Soviet constitution did also use phrases such as \"building socialism and communism\", \"on the road to communism\", \"to build the material and technical basis of communism\" and \"to perfect socialist social relations and transform them into communist relations\" in the preamble.{{sfn|Tang|1980|p=43}}\n\n=== People's democratic state ===\nThe [[People's democracy (Marxism\u2013Leninism)|people's democratic state]] was implemented in Eastern Europe after [[World War II]].{{sfn|Skillings|1961|p=16}} It can be defined as a state and society in which feudal vestiges have been liquidated and where the system of private ownership exists, but it is eclipsed by the state-owned enterprises in the field of industry, transport and credit.{{sfn|Skillings|1961|p=21}}\n\nIn the words of [[Eugene Varga]], \"the state itself and its apparatus of violence serve the interests, not of the monopolistic bourgeoisie, but of the toilers of town and country\".{{sfn|Skillings|1961|p=21}} Soviet philosopher N. P. Farberov stated: \"People's democracy in the people's republics is a democracy of the toiling classes, headed by the working class, a broad and full democracy for the overwhelming majority of the people, that is, a socialist democracy in its character and its trend. In this sense we call it popular\".{{sfn|Skillings|1961|p=21}}\n\n=== People's republican state ===\nThe [[People's republic|people's republican state]] is a type of socialist state with a republican constitution. Although the term initially became associated with [[populist]] movements in the 19th century such as the German [[V\u00f6lkisch movement]] and the [[Narodniks]] in Russia, it is now associated to communist states. A number of the short-lived communist states which formed during [[World War I]] and [[Aftermath of World War I|its aftermath]] called themselves people's republics. Many of these sprang up in the territory of the former [[Russian Empire]] following the [[October Revolution]].<ref>{{cite book|title=How Ukraine Became a Market Economy and Democracy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C8C3xuqd6aMC|first=Anders|last=\u00c5slund|publisher=Peterson Institute|year=2009|isbn=9780881325461|page=12}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Miniature Empires: A Historical Dictionary of the Newly Independent States|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jwNeAgAAQBAJ|first=James|last=Minahan|publisher=Routledge|year=2013|isbn=9781135940102|page=296}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Power, Networks and Violent Conflict in Central Asia: A Comparison of Tajikistan and Uzbekistan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vv7pAwAAQBAJ|first=Idil|last=Tun\u00e7er-K\u0131lavuz|publisher=Routledge|year=2014|isbn=9781317805113|series=Routledge advances in Central Asian studies|volume=Volume 5|page=53}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Mongolic Elements in Tuvan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zddhapKVdHMC|first=Bayarma|last=Khabtagaeva|publisher=Otto Harrassowitz Verlag|year=2009|isbn=9783447060950|series=Turcologica Series|volume=Volume 81|page=21}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Peoples of Eastern Asia|volume=Volume 8: Mongolia\u2013Nepal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QXWjAmmZ5kMC|publisher=Marshall Cavendish|year=2004|first1=Fiona|last1=Macdonald|first2=Gillian|last2=Stacey|first3=Philip|last3=Steele|isbn=9780761475477|page=413}}</ref>\n\nAdditional people's republics emerged following the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] victory in World War II, mainly within the [[Soviet Union]]'s [[Eastern Bloc]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Democratisation and Institutional Reform in Albania|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l5FODwAAQBAJ|first=Elvin|last=Gjevori|publisher=Springer|year=2018|isbn=9783319730714|page=21}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Bulgaria in British Foreign Policy, 1943\u20131949|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iCw2DgAAQBAJ|first=Marietta|last=Stankova|publisher=Anthem Press|year=2014|series=Anthem Series on Russian, East European and Eurasian Studies|isbn=9781783082353|page=148}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Cabinets in Eastern Europe|doi=10.1057/9781403905215_6|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|editor-first1=Jean|editor-last1=Blondel|editor-first2=Ferdinand|editor-last2=M\u00fcller-Rommel|first1=Ferdinand|last1=M\u00fcller-Rommel|first2=Zdenka|last2=Mansfeldov\u00e1|chapter=Chapter 5: Czech Republic|year=2001|isbn=978-1-349-41148-1|page=62}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Labour Law in Hungary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L1Ra6WYtqsgC|first=J\u00f3zsef|last=Hajd\u00fa|publisher=Kluwer Law International|year=2011|isbn=9789041137920|page=27}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Legal Reform in Post-Communist Europe: The View from Within|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LAiYFR0MPXgC|first1=Stanis\u0142aw|last1=Frankowski|first2=Paul B.|last2=Stephan|publisher=Martinus Nijhoff|year=1995|isbn=9780792332183|page=23}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=NATO and Eastern Europe After 2000: Strategic Interactions with Poland, the Czech Republic, Romania, and Bulgaria|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PE_D8ZewHKQC|first=Laure|last=Paquette|publisher=Nova|year=2001|isbn=9781560729693|page=55}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Yugoslavia as History: Twice There Was a Country|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AZ1x7gvwx_8C|first=John R.|last=Lampe|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2000|isbn=9780521774017|page=233}}</ref> In Asia, [[China]] became a people's republic following the [[Chinese Communist Revolution]]<ref>{{cite web|title=The Chinese Revolution of 1949|url=https://history.state.gov/milestones/1945-1952/chinese-rev|website=Office of the Historian, Bureau of Public Affairs|publisher=United States Department of State}}</ref> and [[North Korea]] also became a people's republic.<ref>{{cite book|title=North Korea: The Politics of Regime Survival|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-EHfBQAAQBAJ|first1=Young Whan|last1=Kihl|first2=Hong Nack|last2= Kim|publisher=Routledge|year=2014|isbn=9781317463764|page=8}}</ref>\n\nDuring the 1960s, [[Socialist Republic of Romania|Romania]] and [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] ceased to use the term people's republic in their official name, replacing it with the term socialist republic as a mark of their ongoing political development.

National-democratic state ===\nThe concept of the national-democratic state tried to theorize how a state could develop socialism by bypassing the [[capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist mode of production]].{{sfn|Poelzer|1989|p=13}} While the theory of non-capitalist development was first articulated by [[Vladimir Lenin]], the novelty of this concept was applying it to the progressive elements of the [[national liberation movements]] in the [[Third World]].{{sfn|Poelzer|1989|p=13}} The term national-democratic state was introduced shortly after the [[Death and state funeral of Joseph Stalin|death of Stalin]], who believed colonies to be mere lackeys of Western imperialism and that the socialist movement few prospects there.{{sfn|Poelzer|1989|p=13}}\n\nThe countries in which the national liberations movements took power and which instituted an [[anti-imperialist]] foreign policy and sought to construct a form of socialism were considered as national-democratic states by Marxist\u2013Leninists.{{sfn|Poelzer|1989|p=13}} An example of a national-democratic state is Egypt under [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] which was committed to constructing [[Arab socialism]].{{sfn|Poelzer|1989|p=14}} With the exception of Cuba, none of these states managed to develop socialism.{{sfn|Poelzer|1989|p=14}} According to scholar Sylvia Woodby Edington, this might explain why the concept of the national-democratic state \"never received full theoretical elaboration as a political system\".{{sfn|Poelzer|1989|p=14}} However, one feature was clearly defined, namely that these states did not need to be led by a Marxist\u2013Leninist party.{{sfn|Poelzer|1989|p=16}}\n\n=== Socialist-oriented state ===\nA [[socialist-oriented state]] seeks to reach socialism by non-capitalist development.{{sfn|Poelzer|1989|p=15}} As a term, it is substantially different from the concept of the national-democratic state.{{sfn|Poelzer|1989|p=15}} The singular difference is that the socialist-oriented state was divided into two stages, firstly into a national-democratic socialist-oriented state and secondly into a people's democratic socialist-oriented state.{{sfn|Poelzer|1989|p=16}} Countries belonging to the national-democratic socialist-oriented state category were also categorised as national-democratic states.{{sfn|Poelzer|1989|p=16}} Examples of national-democratic socialist-oriented states are [[Algeria]] ruled by the [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|National Liberation Front]], [[Ba'athist Iraq]] and [[Socialist Burma]].{{sfn|Poelzer|1989|p=16}} In contrast, people's democratic socialist-oriented states had to be guided by Marxism\u2013Leninism and accept the universal truths of Marxism\u2013Leninism and reject other notions of socialism such as [[African socialism]].{{sfn|Poelzer|1989|p=16}}\n\nThe socialist-oriented states had seven defining features, namely they were revolutionary democracies, had a revolutionary-democratic party, class dictatorship, defense of the socialist-oriented states, had organs of socialisation, initiated socialist construction and the type of socialist-oriented state (either national-democratic or people's democratic).{{sfn|Poelzer|1989|p=22}} The political goal of [[revolutionary democracy]] is to create the conditions for socialism in countries were the social, political and economic conditions for socialism do not exist.{{sfn|Poelzer|1989|p=23}} The second feature to be met is the establishment of a revolutionary-democratic party which has to establish itself as the leading force and guide the state by using Marxist\u2013Leninist ideology.{{sfn|Poelzer|1989|p=24}} While introduced in these states, [[democratic centralism]] is rarely upheld.{{sfn|Poelzer|1989|p=25}}\n\nUnlike capitalism which is ruled by the bourgeoisie class and socialism were the proletariat leads, the socialist-oriented state represents a broad and heterogeneous group of classes that seek to consolidate national independence.{{sfn|Poelzer|1989|p=25}} Since the peasantry were usually the largest class in socialist-oriented states, their role were emphasised\u2014similar to the working class in other socialist states.{{sfn|Poelzer|1989|p=26}} However, Marxist\u2013Leninist admitted that these states often fell under the control of certain cliques such as the [[Derg|military in Ethiopia]].{{sfn|Poelzer|1989|p=26}} The establishing of a legal system and coercive institutions are also noted to safeguard the socialist-oriented nature of the state.{{sfn|Poelzer|1989|p=44}} The fifth feature is that the media and educational system has to be taken over by the socialist-oriented state while establishing mass organisations to mobilise the populace.{{sfn|Poelzer|1989|pp=50\u201352}} Unlike the Soviet economic model, the economy of the socialist-oriented states are [[mixed economies]] that seek to attract [[foreign capital]] and which seeks to maintain and develop the [[private sector]].{{sfn|Poelzer|1989|pp=54\u201355}} In the words of Soviet leader [[Leonid Brezhnev]], these states were in the process of taking over the [[commanding heights of the economy]] and instituting a state planned economy.{{sfn|Poelzer|1989|p=14}} According to Soviet sources, only Laos was the one socialist-oriented state that has managed to develop into a socialist state.{{sfn|Poelzer|1989|p=61}}\n\n=== Socialist state ===\nA [[socialist state]] is more than a form of government and can only exist in countries with a [[socialist economy]]. There are examples of several states that have instituted a socialist [[form of government]] before achieving socialism. The former socialist states of Eastern Europe were established as people's democracies (a developmental stage between [[capitalism]] and [[socialism]]). On the question of the Marxist\u2013Leninist ruled countries of Africa and the Middle East, the Soviet Union deemed none of them to be socialist states\u2014referring to them as socialist-oriented states. While many countries with constitutional references to socialism and countries ruled by long-standing socialist movements exist, within Marxist\u2013Leninist theory a socialist state is led by a [[communist party]] that has instituted a socialist economy in a given country.{{sfn|Harding|1981|p=27}} It deals with states that define themselves either as a socialist state or as a state led by a governing Marxist\u2013Leninist party in their constitutions. For this reason alone, these states are often called communist states.{{sfn|Wilczynski|2008|p=21|loc=Contrary to Western usage, these countries describe themselves as 'Socialist' (not 'Communist'). The second stage (Marx's 'higher phase'), or 'Communism' is to be marked by an age of plenty, distribution according to needs (not work), the absence of money and the market mechanism, the disappearance of the last vestiges of capitalism and the ultimate 'whithering away of the state'.}}{{sfn|Steele|1999|p=45|loc=Among Western journalists the term 'Communist' came to refer exclusively to regimes and movements associated with the Communist International and its offspring: regimes which insisted that they were not communist but socialist, and movements which were barely communist in any sense at all.}}{{sfn|Rosser|2003|p=14|loc=Ironically, the ideological father of communism, Karl Marx, claimed that communism entailed the withering away of the state. The dictatorship of the proletariat was to be a strictly temporary phenomenon. Well aware of this, the Soviet Communists never claimed to have achieved communism, always labeling their own system socialist rather than communist and viewing their system as in transition to communism.}}\n\n== Political system ==\n=== Government ===\nIn communist states, the highest administrative agency of state power is the government.{{sfn|Feldbrugge|1985|p=202}} It functions as the executive organ of the legislature.{{sfn|Feldbrugge|1985|p=202}} The [[Supreme Soviet]] has been introduced with variations in all communist states.{{sfn|White|Gardner|Sch\u00f6pflin|1987|p=86}} For most of its existence, the Soviet government was known as the [[Council of Ministers (Soviet Union)|Council of Ministers]]{{sfn|Feldbrugge|1985|p=202}} and identical names were used for the governments of [[People's Socialist Republic of Albania|Albania]], [[East Germany]], [[Hungarian People's Republic|Hungary]], [[Polish People's Republic|Poland]] and [[Socialist Republic of Romania|Romania]].{{sfn|Staar|1988|p=36 (Bulgaria), 65 (Czechoslovakia), 133 (Hungary), 161 (Romania), 195 (Poland).}} It was independent of the other central agencies such as the legislature and its presidium, but the Supreme Soviet was empowered to decide on all questions it wished.{{sfn|Feldbrugge|1985|pp=202\u2013203}} The Soviet government was responsible to the legislature and in between sessions of the legislature it reported to the legislature's standing committee.{{sfn|Feldbrugge|1985|p=203}} The standing committee could reorganise and hold the Soviet government accountable, but it could not instruct the government.{{sfn|Feldbrugge|1985|p=203}} The government was responsible for the overall economic system, public order, foreign relations and defense.{{sfn|Feldbrugge|1985|p=203}} The Soviet model was more or less identically implemented in [[People's Republic of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Czechoslovakia]], East Germany, Hungary, Poland and Romania, with few exceptions.{{sfn|Staar|1988|p=36 (Bulgaria), 65 (Czechoslovakia), 133 (Hungary), 161 (Romania), 195 (Poland).}} One exepction was Czechoslovakia, where it had a [[President of Czechoslovakia|president]] and not a collective presidency;{{sfn|Starr|1987|p=64}} and Bulgaria, where the State Council was empowered to instruct the Council of Ministers.{{sfn|Dimitrov|2006|p=170}}\n\n=== Legislature ===\n==== Powers and organisation ====\n[[File:Great Hall Of The People At Night.JPG|thumb|The meeting place of the Chinese [[National People's Congress]]]]\nAll state power is unified in the legislature in communist states.{{sfn|Hand|2016|p=2}} This is a firm rejection of the [[separation of power]]s found in liberal democracies.{{sfn|Hand|2016|p=2}} The constitution is passed by the legislature and can only be amended by the legislature.{{sfn|Hand|2016|p=2}} Judicial review and extra-parliamentary review were denounced by Soviet legal theorists as bourgeoisie institutions.{{sfn|Hand|2016|p=2}} They also perceived it as a limitation of the people's supreme power.{{sfn|Hand|2016|p=2}} The legislature together with its suborgans was responsible for overseeing the constitutional order.{{sfn|Hand|2016|p=2}} Since the legislature is the supreme judge of constitutionality, the legislature's own acts cannot, therefore, be unconstitutional.{{sfn|Hazard|1985|p=163}}\n\nThe [[Supreme Soviet]] was the first socialist legislature and the Soviet legislative system has been introduced in all communist states.{{sfn|White|Gardner|Sch\u00f6pflin|1987|p=86}} The Supreme Soviet convened twice a year, usually for two or three days each, making it one of the world's first frequently convened legislatures during its existence.{{sfn|White|Gardner|Sch\u00f6pflin|1987|p=91}} The same meeting frequency was the norm in the Eastern Bloc countries as well as modern-day China.{{sfn|White|Gardner|Sch\u00f6pflin|1987|pp=114\u2013115}} China's legislature, the [[National People's Congress]] (NPC) is modeled on the Soviet one.{{sfn|White|Gardner|Sch\u00f6pflin|1987|p=114}} As with the Soviet one, the NPC is the highest organ of the state and elects a [[Standing Committee of the National People's Congress|Standing Committee]] (the Soviets had a [[Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union|Presidium]]), the government and the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]] (the Soviet counterpart being the [[Council of Ministers (Soviet Union)|Council of Ministers]]).{{sfn|White|Gardner|Sch\u00f6pflin|1987|p=115}} In addition, all communist states the ruling party has either had a clear majority such as China, or held every seats as they did in the Soviet Union in their national legislature.{{sfn|White|Gardner|Sch\u00f6pflin|1987|p=82}}\n\nWestern researchers have devoted little attention to legislatures in communist states.{{sfn|Nelson|1982|p=1}} The reason being that there are not significant bodies of political socialization when compared to legislatures in liberal democracies.{{sfn|Nelson|1982|p=1}} While political leaders are often elected as members of socialist legislatures, these post are not relevant to political advancement.{{sfn|Nelson|1982|p=1}} The role of legislatures is different from country to country.{{sfn|Nelson|1982|p=1}} In the Soviet Union, the [[Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union|Supreme Soviet]] did \"little more than listen to statements from Soviet political leaders and to legitimate decisions already made elsewhere\" while in the legislatures of Poland, Vietnam and Yugoslavia it has been more active and had an impact on rule-making.{{sfn|Nelson|1982|p=1}}\n\n==== Representativity ====\nBoth Marx and Lenin abhorred the parliamentary systems of [[bourgeois democracy]], but neither of them sought to abolish it.{{sfn|Nelson|1982|p=7}} Lenin wrote that it would be impossible to develop [[proletarian democracy]] without \"without representative institutions\".{{sfn|Nelson|1982|p=7}} Both of them considered the governing model of the [[Paris Commune of 1871]] in which executive and legislative were combined in one body to be ideal.{{sfn|Nelson|1982|p=7}} More importantly, Marx applauded the election process by \"universial suffrage in the various wards and town\".{{sfn|Nelson|1982|p=7}} While the institution of the socialist legislature might not be important in itself, they \"have a place in the literature and rhetoric of the ruling parties which cannot be ignored\u2014in the language of the party's intimacy with working masses, of its alleged knowledge about interests of working people, of social justice and socialist democracy, of the [[mass line]] and learning from the people\".{{sfn|Nelson|1982|p=6}}\n\nBy having legislatures, the Marxist\u2013Leninist parties try to keep ideological consistency between supporting representative institutions and safeguarding the leading role of the party.{{sfn|Nelson|1982|p=7}} The seek to use the legislatures as a linkage between the rulers and the ruled.{{sfn|Nelson|1982|p=7}} These institutions are representative and usually mirror the population in areas such as [[ethnicity]] and [[language]], \"yet with occupations distributed in a manner skewed towards government officials\".{{sfn|Nelson|1982|p=7}} Unlike in liberal democracies, legislatures of communist states are not to act as a forum for conveying demands or interest articulation\u2014they meet too infrequently for this to be the case.{{sfn|Nelson|1982|p=8}} This might explain why communist states have not developed terms such as delegates and trustees to give legislature representatives to vote according to their best judgement or in the interest of their constituency.{{sfn|Nelson|1982|p=8}} Scholar Daniel Nelson has noted: \"As with the British parliament before the seventeenth-century turmoil secured its supremacy, legislative bodies in communist states physically portray the 'realm' ruled by (to stretch an anaology) 'kings'. Members of the assemblies 'represent' the population to whom the rulers speak and over whom they govern, convening a broader 'segment of society' [...] than the court itself\".{{sfn|Nelson|1982|p=8}} Despite this, it does not mean that the communist states use legislatures to strengthen their communication with the populace\u2014the party, rather than the legislature, could take that function.{{sfn|Nelson|1982|p=8}}\n\nIdeologically, it has another function, namely to prove that communist states do not only represent the interests of the working class, but all social strata.{{sfn|Nelson|1982|p=9}} Communist states are committed to establish a classless society and use legislatures to show that all social strata, whether bureaucrat, worker or intellectual, are committed and have interests in building such a society.{{sfn|Nelson|1982|p=9}} As is the case in China, national institutions such as the legislature \"must exist which brings together representatives of all nationalities and geographic areas\".{{sfn|Nelson|1982|p=9}} It does not matter if the legislatures only rubber stamp decisions because by having them it shows that communist states are committed to incorporate minorities and areas of the country by included them in the composition of the legislature.{{sfn|Nelson|1982|p=9}} In communist states, there is usually a high proportion of members who are government officials.{{sfn|Nelson|1982|p=10}} In this instance, it might mean that its less important what legislatures do and more important who its representatives are.{{sfn|Nelson|1982|p=10}} A member of a socialist legislature at central and local level is usually either a government or party official, leading figure in their community, or national figure outside the communist party.{{sfn|Nelson|1982|p=10}} This goes to show that legislatures are tools to garner popular support for the government in which leading figures campaign and spread information about the party's policies and ideological development.{{sfn|Nelson|1982|p=10}}\n\n=== Military ===\n==== Control ====\nCommunist states have established two types of civil-military systems. The armed forces of most socialist states have historically been state institutions based on the Soviet model,{{sfn|Kramer|1985|p=47}} but in China, Laos, North Korea and Vietnam the armed forces are party-state institutions. However, there are several differences between the statist (Soviet) model and the party-state model (China). In the Soviet model, the [[Soviet armed forces]] was led by the Council of Defense (an organ formed by the [[Presidium of the Supreme Soviet|Presidium]] of the [[Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union]]) while the Council of Ministers was responsible for formulating defense policies.{{sfn|Snyder|1987|p=28}} The party leader was ''[[ex officio]]'' the Chairman of the Council of Defense.{{sfn|Snyder|1987|p=28}} Below the Council of Defense, there was the Main Military Council which was responsible for the strategic direction and leadership of the Soviet armed forces.{{sfn|Snyder|1987|p=28}} The working organ of the Council of Defense was the General Staff which was tasked with analysing military and political situations as they developed.{{sfn|Snyder|1987|p=30}} The party controlled the armed forces through the Main Political Directorate (MPD) of the [[Ministry of Defense (Soviet Union)|Ministry of Defense]], a state organ that functioned \"with the authority of a department of the [[CPSU Central Committe]]\".{{sfn|Loeber|1984|p=13}} The MPD organised political indoctrination and created political control mechanism at the center to the company level in the field.{{sfn|Staff writer|1980|p=1}} Formally, the MPD was responsible for organising party and [[Komsomol]] organs as well as subordinate organs within the armed forces; ensuring that the party and state retains control over the armed forces; evaluates the political performance of officers; supervising the ideological content of the military press; and supervising the political-military training institutes and their ideological content.{{sfn|Staff writer|1980|p=1}} The head of the MPD was ranked fourth in military protocol, but it was not a member of the Council of Defense.{{sfn|Staff writer|1980|p=3}} The Administrative Organs Department of the CPSU Central Committee was responsible for implementing the party personnel policies and supervised the [[KGB]], the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the Ministry of Defense.{{sfn|Kokoshin|2016|p=19}}\n\nIn the Chinese party-state model, the [[People's Liberation Army]] (PLA) is a party institution.{{sfn|Mulvenon|2018|p=3}} In the preamble of the [[Constitution of the Communist Party of China]], it is stated: \"The [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC) shall uphold its absolute leadership over the People's Liberation Army and other people's armed forces\".{{sfn|Mulvenon|2018|p=3}} The PLA carries out its work in accordance with the instructions of the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of China|CPSU Central Committe]].{{sfn|Mulvenon|2012|p=251}} [[Mao Zedong]] described the PLA's institutional situation as follows: \"Every communist must grasp the truth, '[[Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun]]'. Our principle is that the party commands the gun, and the gun must never be allowed to command the Party\".{{sfn|Blasko|2006|p=6}} The [[Central Military Commission (China)|Central Military Commission]] (CMC) is both an organ of the state and the party\u2014it is an organ of the CPC Central Committee and an organ of the national legislature, the National People's Congress.{{sfn|Blasko|2006|p=27}} The [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|CPC General Secretary]] is ''ex officio'' [[Chairman of the Central Military Commission|party CMC Chairman]] and the [[President of the People's Republic of China]] is by right state CMC Chairman.{{sfn|Blasko|2006|p=27}} The composition of the party CMC and the state CMC are identical.{{sfn|Blasko|2006|p=27}} The CMC is responsible for the command of the PLA and determines national defense policies.{{sfn|Blasko|2006|p=27}} There are fifteen departments that report directly to the CMC and that are responsible for everything from political work to administration of the PLA.<ref name=\"rand\">{{cite web|url=https://www.rand.org/blog/2016/09/pla-reforms-and-their-ramifications.html|title=People's Liberation Army Reforms and Their Ramifications|last=Garafola|first=Cristina L.|publisher=[[RAND Corporation]]|date=23 September 2016|accessdate=27 December 2019}}</ref> Of significance is that the CMC eclipses by far the prerogatives of the CPSU Administrative Organs Department while the Chinese counterpart to the Main Political Directorate supervises not only the military, but also intelligence, the security services and counterespionage work.{{sfn|Kokoshin|2016|p=23}}\n\n==== Representation ====\nUnlike in liberal democracies, active military personnel are members and partake in civilian institutions of governance.{{sfn|Staff writer|1980|p=7}} This is the case in all communist states.{{sfn|Staff writer|1980|p=7}} For instance, the [[Communist Party of Vietnam]] (CPV) has elected at least one active military figure to its [[Politburo of the Communist Party of Vietnam|CPV Politburo]] since 1986.{{sfn|Thayer|2008|p=68}} In the 1986\u20132006 period, active military figures sitting in the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of Vietnam|CPV Central Committee]] stood at an average of 9,2 percent.{{sfn|Thayer|2008|p=68}} Military figures are also represented in the national legislature (the [[National Assembly of Vietnam|National Assembly]]) and other representative institutions.{{sfn|Thayer|2008|p=68}} In China, the two [[Vice Chairman of the Central Military Commission|CMC vice chairmen]] have had by right office seats in the [[Politburo of the Communist Party of China|CPC Politburo]] since 1987.{{sfn|Miller|2018|p=4}}\n\n=== Ruling party ===\n==== Leading role ====\nEvery communist state has been led by a Marxist\u2013Leninist party.{{sfn|Harding|1981|p=27}} This party seeks to represent and articulate the interests of the classes exploited by [[capitalism]].{{sfn|Harding|1981|p=27}} It seeks to lead the exploited classes to achieve communism.{{sfn|Harding|1981|p=27}} However, the party cannot be identified with the exploited class in general.{{sfn|Harding|1981|p=27}} Its membership is composed of members with advanced consciousness who are above sectional interests.{{sfn|Harding|1981|p=27}} Therefore, the party represents the advanced section of the exploited classes and through them leads the exploited classes by interpreting the universal laws governing human history towards communism.{{sfn|Harding|1981|pp=27\u201328}} \n\nIn ''[[Foundations of Leninism]]'' (1924), [[Joseph Stalin]] wrote that \"the proletariat [working class] needs the Party first of all as its General Staff, which it must have for the successful seizure of power. [...] But the proletariat needs the Party not only to achieve the [class] dictatorship; it needs it still more to maintain the [class] dictatorship\".{{sfn|Steiner|1951|p=58}} The current [[Constitution of Vietnam]] states in Article 4 that \"[t]he [[Communist Party of Vietnam]], the vanguard of the Vietnamese working class, simultaneously the vanguard of the toiling people and of the Vietnamese nation, the faithful representative of the interests of the working class, the toiling people, and the whole nation, acting upon the Marxist\u2013Leninist doctrine and [[Ho Chi Minh]]'s thought, is the leading force of the state and society\".{{sfn|Bui|2016|p=223}} In a similar form, the [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC) describes itself as \"the vanguard of the Chinese working class, the Chinese people, and the Chinese nation\".{{sfn|Li|2017|p=219}} As noted by both communist parties, the ruling parties of communist states are [[vanguard parties]]. [[Vladimir Lenin]] theorised that vanguard parties were \"capable of assuming power and leading the whole people to socialism, of directing and organising the new system, of being the teacher, the guide, the leader of all the working and exploited people in organizing their social life without the bourgeoisie\".{{sfn|Evans|1993|p=20}} This idea eventually evolved into the concept of the party's leading role in leading the state{{sfn|Evans|1993|p=20}} as seen in the CPC's self-description and Vietnam's constitution.{{sfn|Bui|2016|p=223}}{{sfn|Li|2017|p=219}}\n\n==== Internal organization ====\nThe Marxist\u2013Leninist governing party organises itself around the principle of [[democratic centralism]] and through it the state too.{{sfn|White|Gardner|Sch\u00f6pflin|1987|p=131}} It means that all directing bodies of the party, from top to bottom, shall be elected; that party bodies shall give periodical accounts of their activities to their respective party organizations; that there shall be strict party discipline and the subordination of the minority to the majority; and that all decisions of higher bodies shall be absolutely binding on lower bodies and on all party members.{{sfn|White|Gardner|Sch\u00f6pflin|1987|p=131}}\n\nThe highest organ of a Marxist\u2013Leninist governing party is the party congress.<ref name=\"CConly\">{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Central-Committee-Soviet-political-body|title=Central Committee|encyclopedia=[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]|accessdate=26 December 2019}}</ref> The congress elects the central committee and either an auditing commission and a control commission, or both, although not always.<ref name=\"CConly\"/> The central committee is the party's highest decision-making organ in between party congresses and elects a politburo and a secretariat amongst its members as well as the party's leader.<ref name=\"CConly\"/> When the central committee is not in session, the politburo is the highest decision-making organ of the party and the secretariat is the highest administrative organ.<ref name=\"CConly\"/> In certain parties, either the central committee or the politburo elects amongst its members a standing committee of the politburo which acts as the highest decision-making organ in between sessions of the politburo, central committee and the congress. This leadership structure is identical all the way down to the primary party organisation of the ruling party.<ref name=\"CConly\"/>\n\n== Economic system ==\nFrom reading their works, many followers of [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] drew the idea that the socialist economy would be based on planning and not market mechanism.{{sfn|Ellman|2014|pp=1\u20132}} These ideas later developed into the belief that planning was superior to market mechanism.{{sfn|Ellman|2014|p=2}} Upon seizing power, the [[Bolsheviks]] began advocating a national state planning system.{{sfn|Ellman|2014|p=2}} The [[8th Congress of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks)]] resolved to institute \"the maximum centralisation of production [...] simultaneously striving to establish a unified economic plan\".{{sfn|Ellman|2014|p=2}} The [[Gosplan]], the State Planning Commission, the [[Supreme Soviet of the National Economy]] and other central planning organs were established during the 1920s in the era of the [[New Economic Policy]].{{sfn|Ellman|2014|p=9}} On introducing the planning system, it became common belief in the international communist movement that the Soviet planning system was a more advanced form of economic organization then capitalism.{{sfn|Ellman|2014|p=11}} This led to the system being introduced voluntary in countries such as China, Cuba and Vietnam and in some cases imposed by the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Ellman|2014|p=11}}\n\nIn communist states, the [[Soviet-type economic planning|state planning]] system had five main characteristics.{{sfn|Ellman|2014|p=22}} Firstly, with the exception of the field consumption and employment, practically all decisions were centralized at the top.{{sfn|Ellman|2014|p=22}} Secondly, the system was [[Hierarchy|hierarchical]]\u2014the center formulated a plan that was sent down to the level below which would imitate the process and send the plan further down the pyramid.{{sfn|Ellman|2014|p=22}} Thirdly, the plans were binding in nature, i.e. everyone had to follow and meet the goals set forth in it.{{sfn|Ellman|2014|p=22}} Fourtly, the predominace of calculating in physical terms to ensure planned allocation of commodities were not incompatible with planned production.{{sfn|Ellman|2014|p=22}} Finally, money played a passive role within the state sector since the planners focused on physical allocation.{{sfn|Ellman|2014|p=22}}\n\nAccording to Michael Ellman, in a [[planned economy]] \"the state owns the land and all other natural resources and all characteristics of the traditional model the enterprises and their productive assets. Collective ownership (e.g. the property of collective farms) also exists, but plays a subsidiary role, and is expected to be temporary\".{{sfn|Ellman|2014|p=22}} The [[private ownership]] of the means of production still exist, although it plays a fairly smaller role.{{sfn|Ellman|2014|p=23}} Since the class struggle in capitalism is caused by the division between owners of the means of production and the workers who sell their labour, [[state ownership]] (defined as the property of the people in these systems) is considering as a tool to end class struggle and to empower the working class.{{sfn|Ellman|2014|p=25}}\n\n== Judicial system ==\n=== Constitution ===\n==== Role of constitutions ====\n[[Marxism\u2013Leninism|Marxist\u2013Leninists]] view the [[constitution]] as a [[Organic law|fundamental law]] and as an instrument of force.{{sfn|Chang|1956|p=520}} The constitution is the source of law and legality.{{sfn|Chang|1956|p=521}} Unlike in [[liberal democracies]], the Marxist\u2013Leninist constitution is not a framework to limit the power of the state.{{sfn|Chang|1956|p=521}} To the contrary, a Marxist\u2013Leninist constitution seeks to empower the state\u2014believing the state to be an organ of class domination and law to be the expression of the interests of the dominant class.{{sfn|Chang|1956|p=521}} It is the belief of Marxist\u2013Leninists that all national constitutions do this to ensure that countries can strengthen and enforce their own class system.{{sfn|Chang|1956|p=521}} In this instance, it means that Marxist\u2013Leninists conceive of constitutions as a tool to defend the socialist nature of the state and attack its enemies.{{sfn|Chang|1956|p=521}} This contrasts with the liberal conception of [[constitutionalism]] that \"law, rather than men, is supreme\".{{sfn|Chang|1956|p=xi}}\n\nUnlike the fixed nature of liberal democratic constitutions, a Marxist\u2013Leninist constitution is ever-changing.{{sfn|Chang|1956|p=522}} [[Andrey Vyshinsky]], a [[Procurator General of the Soviet Union]] during the 1930s, notes that the \"Soviet constitutions represent the sum total of the historic path along which the Soviet state has traveled. At the same time, they are the legislative basis of subsequent development of state life\".{{sfn|Chang|1956|p=522}} That is, the constitution sums up what already has been achieved.{{sfn|Chang|1956|p=xii}} This belief is also shared by the [[Communist Party of China]] which argued that \"the Chinese Constitution blazes a path for China, recording what has been won in China and what is yet to be conquered\".{{sfn|Chang|1956|p=522}} A constitution in a communist state has an end.{{sfn|Chang|1956|p=524}} For instance, the preamble of the [[1954 Constitution of the People's Republic of China|1954 Chinese constitution]] outlines the historical tasks of the Chinese communists, \"step by step, to bring about the [[Socialism (Marxism)|socialist industrialisation of the country]] and, step by step, to accomplish the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicraft and [[capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist industry and commerce]]\".{{sfn|Chang|1956|p=524}}\n\nIn communist states, the constitution was a tool to analyse the development of society.{{sfn|Triska|1968|p=xii}} The Marxist\u2013Leninist party in question would have to study the correlation of forces, literally society's class structure, before enacting changes.{{sfn|Triska|1968|p=xii}} Several terms were coined for different developmental states by Marxist\u2013Leninists legal theorists, including [[New Democracy|new democracy]], [[People's democracy (Marxism\u2013Leninism)|people's democracy]] and the [[primary stage of socialism]].{{sfn|Chang|1956|p=xii}} This is also why amendments to constitutions are not enough and major societal changes need a constitution which corresponds with the reality of the new class structure.{{sfn|Chang|1956|p=xii}}\n\nWith [[Nikita Khrushchev]]'s [[On the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences|repudiation of Stalin's practices]] and the [[Communist Party of China]]'s repudiation of certain [[Maoist]] policies, Marxist\u2013Leninist legal theories began to emphasise \"the formal, formerly neglected constitutional order\".{{sfn|Chang|1956|p=xiii}} [[Deng Xiaoping]], not long after [[Chairman of the Communist Party of China|Chairman]] [[Mao Zedong]] 's death, noted that \"[d]emocracy has to be institutionalised and written into law, so as to make sure that institutions and laws do not change whenever the leadership changes or whenever the leaders change their views. [...] The trouble now is that our legal system is incomplete. [...] Very often what leaders say is taken as law and anyone who disagrees is called a lawbreaker\".{{sfn|Keith|1992|p=112}} In 1986, Li Buyan wrote that \"the policies of the Party usually are regulations and calls which to a certain extent are only principles. The law is different; it is rigorously standardised. It explicitly and concretely stipulates what the people should, can or cannot do\".{{sfn|Keith|1992|p=114}} These legal developments have been echoed in later years in Cuba, Laos and Vietnam. This has led to the development of the communist concept of socialist rule of law which runs parallel to and is disctint to the [[Rule of law|liberal term]] of the same name.{{sfn|Keith|1992|p=118}} In the last years, this emphasization on the constitution as both a legal document and a paper which documents society's development has been noted by [[Communist Party of China|Chinese Communist Party]] [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|general secretary]] [[Xi Jinping]], who stated in 2013 that \"[n]o organisation or individual has the privilege to overstep the Constitution and law\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2013/06/03/chinas-constitution-debate-hits-a-sensitive-nerve/|title=China's constitution debate hits a sensitive nerve|last1=Wan|first1=William|last2=Qi|first2=Li|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=3 June 2013|accessdate=27 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n==== Constitutional supervision ====\nAfter [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Soviet Union]] [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|general secretary]] [[Joseph Stalin]]'s death, several communist states have experimented with some sort of constitutional supervision.{{sfn|Hand|2016|p=3}} These organs were designed to safeguard the supreme power of the legislature.{{sfn|Hand|2016|p=3}} [[Socialist Republic of Romania|Romania]] was the first to experiment with constitutional supervision when it established a Constitutional Committee in 1965.{{sfn|Hand|2016|p=3}} It was elected by the legislature and leading jurists sat in the committee, but it was only empowered to advice the legislature.{{sfn|Hand|2016|p=3}} Keith Hand has commented that \"[i]t was not an effective institution in practice\".{{sfn|Hand|2016|p=3}} \n\n[[Hungarian People's Republic|Hungary]] and [[Polish People's Republic|Poland]] experimented with constitutional supervision in the early 1980s.{{sfn|Hand|2016|p=3}} Hungary established the Council of Constitutional Law which was elected by the legislature and consisted of several leading jurists.{{sfn|Hand|2016|p=3}} It was empowered to review the constitutionality and legality of statutes, administrative regulations and other normative documents; however, if the agency in question failed to heed its advice, it needed to petition the legislature.{{sfn|Hand|2016|p=3}} In 1989, the Soviets established the Constitutional Supervision Committee which \"was subordinate only to the USSR constitution\".{{sfn|Hand|2016|p=4}} It was empowered \"to review the constitutionality and legality of a range of state acts of the USSR and its republics. Its jurisdiction included laws [passed by the legislature], decrees of the Supreme Soviet\u2019s Presidium, union republic constitutions and laws, some central administrative decrees, Supreme Court explanations, and other central normative documents\".{{sfn|Hand|2016|p=4}} If the committee deemed the legislature to have breached legality, the legislature was obliged to discuss the issue, but it could reject it if more than two-thirds voted against the findings of the Constitutional Supervision Committee.{{sfn|Hand|2016|p=4}} While it was constitutionally powerful, it lacked enforcement powers, it was often ignored and it failed to defend the constitution during the [[1991 Soviet coup d'\u00e9tat attempt|coup]] against [[Mikhail Gorbachev]].{{sfn|Hand|2016|p=5}} \n\nThe [[Generations of Chinese leadership|Chinese leadership]] has argued against establishing a constitutional supervisory committee due to their association with failed communist states of Europe.{{sfn|Hand|2016|p=15}} None of the surviving communist states (China, Cuba, Laos and Vietnam) have experimented with constitutional supervision committees or constitutional supervision of anykind outside the existing framework.{{sfn|Hand|2016|p=16}}\n\n=== Legal system ===\n{{main|Socialist law}}\nAll communist states have been established in countries with a [[civil law system]].{{sfn|Quigley|1989|p=781}} The countries of Eastern Europe had formally been governed by the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]], [[German Empire]] and [[Russian Empire]]\u2014all of whom had civil law legal system.{{sfn|Quigley|1989|p=781}} Cuba had a civil law system imposed on them by Spain while China introduced civil law to overlay with Confucian elements and Vietnam used French law.{{sfn|Quigley|1989|p=781}} Since the establishment of the Soviet Union, there has been a scholarly debate on whether [[socialist law]] is a separate legal system or is a part of the civil law tradition.{{sfn|Quigley|1989|p=781}} Legal scholar Ren\u00e8 David wrote that the socialist legal system \"possesses, in relation to our French law, particular features that give it a complete originality, to the extent that it is no longer possible to connect it, like the former Russian law, to the system of [[Roman law]]\".{{sfn|Quigley|1989|p=782}} Similarly, Christoper Osakwe concludes that socialist law is \"an autonomous legal system to be essentially distinguished from the other contemporary families of law\".{{sfn|Quigley|1989|p=783}} Proponents of socialist law as a separate legal system, have identified the following features:{{sfn|Quigley|1989|p=783}}\n# The socialist law is to disappear with the [[withering away of the state]].{{sfn|Quigley|1989|p=783}}\n# The rule of the Marxist\u2013Leninist party.{{sfn|Quigley|1989|p=783}}\n# The socialist law is subordinate and reflect changes to the economic order (the absorption of [[private law]] by [[public law]]).{{sfn|Quigley|1989|p=783}}\n# The socialist law has a religious character.{{sfn|Quigley|1989|p=784}}\n# The socialist law is [[prerogative]] rather than [[normative]].{{sfn|Quigley|1989|p=784}}\n\nLegal officials argue differently for their case than Westerners.{{sfn|Quigley|1989|p=796}} For instance, \"[t]he predominant view among Soviet jurists in the 1920s was that Soviet law of that period was Western-style law appropriate for a Soviet economy that remained capitalist to a significant degree\".{{sfn|Quigley|1989|p=796}} This changed with the introduction of the [[planned economy]] and the term socialist law was conceived to reflect this in the 1930s.{{sfn|Quigley|1989|p=796}} Hungarian legal theorist Imre Szab\u00f3 acknowledged similarities between socialist law and civil law, but he noted that \"four basic types of law may be distinguished: the laws of the slave, feudal, capitalist and socialist societies\".{{sfn|Quigley|1989|pp=798\u201399}} Using the Marxst theory of [[historical materialism]], Szab\u00f3 argues that socialist law cannot belong to the same law family since the material structure is different  from the capitalist countries as their superstructure (state) has to reflect these differences.{{sfn|Quigley|1989|p=799}} In other words, law is a tool by the [[ruling class]] to govern.{{sfn|Quigley|1989|p=799}} As Ren\u00e8 David notes, socialist jurists \"isolate their law, to put into another category, a reprobate category, the Romanist laws and the common law, is the fact that they reason less as jurists and more as philosophers and Marxists; it is in taking a not strictly legal viewpoint that they affirm the originality of their socialist law\".{{sfn|Quigley|1989|p=797}} However, some socialist legal theorists such as Romanian jurist Victor Zlatescu differentiated between type of law and family of law. According to Zlatescu, \"[t]he distinction between the law of the socialist countries and the law of the capitalist countries is not of the same nature as the difference between Roman-German law and the common law, for example. Socialist law is not a third family among the others, as appears in certain writings of Western comparatists\".{{sfn|Quigley|1989|p=800}} In other words, socialist law is civil law, but it is a different type of law for a different type of society.{{sfn|Quigley|1989|p=800}}\n\nYugoslav jurist Borislav Blagojevic noted that a \"great number of legal institutions and legal relations remain the same in socialist law\", further stating that it is \"necessary and justified\" to put them to use if they are \"in conformity with the corresponding interests of the ruling class in the state in question\".{{sfn|Quigley|1989|p=802}} Importantly, socialist law has retained civil law institutions, methodology and organization.{{sfn|Quigley|1989|p=803}} This can be discerned by the fact that [[East Germany]] retained the [[1896 German civil code]] until 1976 while [[Polish People's Republic|Poland]] used existing Austrian, French, German and Russian civil codes until its adoption of its own civil code in 1964.{{sfn|Quigley|1989|p=801}} Scholar John Quigley wrote that \"[s]ocialist law retains the inquisitorial style of trial, law-creation predominantly by legislatures rather than courts, and a significant role for legal scholarship in construing codes\".{{sfn|Quigley|1989|p=803}}\n\n== List of communist states ==\n=== Current communist states ===\nThe following countries are one-party states in which the institutions of the ruling communist party and the state have become intertwined.

[[Folate]] levels in the individual may affect the course of pathological changes and symptomatology of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency.  \n{{TOC limit}}\n\n==Definition==\nVitamin B<sub>12</sub>, also known as cobalamin, is a water-soluble vitamin essential to the function of all cells. \"Cobalamin\" actually refers to a group of compounds (corrinoids) with near-identical structure. Cobalamins are characterized by a [[porphyrin]]-like [[corrin]] nucleus that contains a single [[cobalt]] atom bound to a [[benzimidazole|benzimidazolyl]] [[nucleotide]] and a variable residue (R) group. Because these chemical compounds have a similar molecular structure, each of which shows vitamin activity in a vitamin-deficient biological system, they are referred to as [[vitamer]]s. The vitamin activity is as a [[coenzyme]], meaning that its presence is required for enzyme-catalyzed reactions.<ref name=DRItext/><ref name=Banerjee2003 /> For [[cyanocobalamin]], the R-residue is [[cyanide]]. For [[hydroxocobalamin]] it is a hydroxyl group. Both of these can be converted to either of the two cobalamin coenzymes that are active in human metabolism: [[adenosylcobalamin]] (AdoB<sub>12</sub>) and [[methylcobalamin]] (MeB<sub>12</sub>). AdoB<sub>12</sub> has a 5\u2032-deoxyadenosyl group linked to the cobalt atom at the core of the molecule; MeB<sub>12</sub> has a methyl group at that location. These enzymatically active enzyme cofactors function, respectively, in [[mitochondria]] and cell [[cytosol]].<ref name=DRItext/>\n\nCyanocobalamin is a manufactured form with a cyano (cyanide) group bound to cobalt. Bacterial fermentation creates AdoB<sub>12</sub> and MeB<sub>12</sub> which are converted to cyanocobalamin by addition of potassium cyanide in the presence of sodium nitrite and heat. Once consumed, cyanocobalamin is converted to the biologically active AdoB<sub>12</sub> and MeB<sub>12</sub>. Cyanocobalamin is the most common form used in dietary supplements and [[food fortification]] because cyanide stabilizes the molecule from degradation. However, methylcobalamin is also offered as a dietary supplement. [[Hydroxocobalamin]] has a hydroxyl group attached to the cobalt atom. It can be injected intramuscularly to treat Vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency. Injected intravenously, it is used to treat cyanide poisoning, as the hydroxyl group is displaced by cyanide, creating a non-toxic cyanocobalamin that is excreted in urine. \"Pseudovitamin B<sub>12</sub>\" refers to compounds that are [[corrinoid]]s with structure similar to the vitamin but without vitamin activity.<ref name=Watanabe2018>{{cite journal |vauthors=Watanabe F, Bito T |title=Determination of Cobalamin and Related Compounds in Foods |journal=J AOAC Int |volume=101 |issue=5 |pages=1308\u20131313 |date=September 2018 |pmid=29669618 |doi=10.5740/jaoacint.18-0045 |url=}}</ref> Pseudovitamin B<sub>12</sub> is the majority corrinoid in [[Spirulina (dietary supplement)|spirulina]], an algal health food sometimes erroneously claimed as having this vitamin activity.<ref name=Watanabe1999>{{cite journal |vauthors=Watanabe F, Katsura H, Takenaka S, Fujita T, Abe K, Tamura Y, Nakatsuka T, Nakano Y |title=Pseudovitamin B(12) is the predominant cobamide of an algal health food, spirulina tablets |journal=J.

The cyanide is bound by conversion of hydroxocobalamin to cyanocobalamin, which is then safely excreted in urine. There is some evidence that hydroxocobalamin is converted to the active enzymatic forms of B<sub>12</sub> more easily than cyanocobalamin, so although it is more expensive than cyanocobalamin, it has been used for vitamin replacement in situations where added reassurance of activity is desired. Intramuscular administration of hydroxocobalamin is the preferred treatment for [[pediatric]] patients with intrinsic cobalamin [[metabolic diseases]], for vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficient patients with [[tobacco amblyopia]] (which is thought to perhaps have a component of cyanide poisoning from cyanide in cigarette smoke); and for treatment of patients with pernicious anemia who have optic neuropathy.<ref name=ObeidFedosov />\n*'''[[Adenosylcobalamin]]''' (adoB<sub>12</sub> or AdoCbl) is an enzymatically active cofactor form of B<sub>12</sub> that naturally occurs in the body.

THF plays an important role in DNA synthesis so reduced availability of THF results in ineffective production of cells with rapid turnover, in particular red blood cells, and also intestinal wall cells which are responsible for absorption. [[Tetrahydrofolate|THF]] may be regenerated via MTR or may be obtained from fresh folate in the diet. Thus all of the DNA synthetic effects of B<sub>12</sub> deficiency, including the [[megaloblastic anemia]] of [[pernicious anemia]], resolve if sufficient dietary folate is present. Thus the best-known \"function\" of B<sub>12</sub> (that which is involved with DNA synthesis, cell-division, and anemia) is actually a facultative function which is mediated by B<sub>12</sub>-conservation of an active form of folate which is needed for efficient DNA production.<ref name=Wick1995>{{cite journal | vauthors = Wickramasinghe SN | title = Morphology, biology and biochemistry of cobalamin- and folate-deficient bone marrow cells | journal = Bailli\u00e8re's Clinical Haematology | volume = 8 | issue = 3 | pages = 441\u201359 | date = September 1995 | pmid = 8534956 | doi = 10.1016/S0950-3536(05)80215-X }}</ref> Other cobalamin-requiring methyltransferase enzymes are also known in bacteria, such as Me-H<sub>4</sub>-MPT, coenzyme M methyltransferase.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Marsh EN |title=Coenzyme B12 (cobalamin)-dependent enzymes |journal=Essays Biochem. |volume=34 |issue= |pages=139\u201354 |date=1999 |pmid=10730193 |doi=10.1042/bse0340139 |url=}}</ref>\n\n===Enzyme function===\nIf folate is present in quantity, then of the two absolutely vitamin B<sub>12</sub>-dependent enzyme-family reactions in humans, the [[Methylmalonyl-CoA mutase|MUT]]-family reactions show the most direct and characteristic secondary effects, focusing on the nervous system (see below). This is because the MTR (methyltransferase-type) reactions are involved in regenerating folate, and thus are less evident when folate is in good supply.\n\nSince the late 1990s, folic acid has begun to be added to fortify flour in many countries, so folate deficiency is now more rare. At the same time, since DNA synthetic-sensitive tests for [[anemia]] and [[erythrocyte]] size are routinely done in even simple medical test clinics (so that these folate-mediated biochemical effects are more often directly detected), the [[Methionine synthase|MTR]]-dependent effects of B<sub>12</sub> deficiency are becoming apparent not as anemia due to DNA-synthetic problems (as they were classically), but now mainly as a simple and less obvious elevation of homocysteine in the blood and urine ([[homocysteinuria]]). This condition may result in long-term damage to arteries and in clotting (stroke and heart attack), but this effect is difficult to separate from other common processes associated with atherosclerosis and aging.\n\nThe specific myelin damage resulting from B<sub>12</sub> deficiency, even in the presence of adequate folate and methionine, is more specifically and clearly a vitamin deficiency problem.<ref name=lpi/> It has been connected to B<sub>12</sub> most directly by reactions related to MUT, which is absolutely required to convert methylmalonyl coenzyme A into succinyl coenzyme A. Failure of this second reaction to occur results in elevated levels of MMA, a myelin destabilizer. Excessive MMA will prevent normal [[fatty acid synthesis]], or it will be incorporated into [[fatty acid]]s itself rather than normal [[malonic acid]]. If this abnormal fatty acid subsequently is incorporated into myelin, the resulting myelin will be too fragile, and demyelination will occur. Although the precise mechanism or mechanisms are not known with certainty, the result is [[subacute combined degeneration of spinal cord]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Naidich MJ, Ho SU | title = Case 87: Subacute combined degeneration | journal = Radiology | volume = 237 | issue = 1 | pages = 101\u20135 | date = October 2005 | pmid = 16183926 | doi = 10.1148/radiol.2371031757 }}</ref> Whatever the cause, it is known that B<sub>12</sub> deficiency causes [[neuropathies]], even if folic acid is present in good supply, and therefore anemia is not present.\n\nVitamin B<sub>12</sub>-dependent [[5-methyltetrahydrofolate-homocysteine methyltransferase|MTR]] reactions may also have neurological effects, through an indirect mechanism. Adequate [[methionine]] (which, like folate, must otherwise be obtained in the diet, if it is not regenerated from [[homocysteine]] by a B<sub>12</sub> dependent reaction) is needed to make [[S-Adenosyl methionine|''S''-adenosyl methionine]] (SAMe), which is in turn necessary for methylation of [[myelin]] sheath [[phospholipid]]s. Although production of SAMe is not B<sub>12</sub> dependent, help in recycling for provision of one adequate substrate for it (the [[essential amino acid]] methionine) is assisted by B<sub>12</sub>. In addition, SAMe is involved in the manufacture of certain [[neurotransmitter]]s, [[catecholamine]]s and in brain metabolism. These neurotransmitters are important for maintaining mood, possibly explaining why depression is associated with B<sub>12</sub> deficiency. Methylation of the myelin sheath phospholipids may also depend on adequate folate, which in turn is dependent on MTR recycling, unless ingested in relatively high amounts.\n\n==Physiology==\n===Absorption===\nFood B<sub>12</sub> is absorbed by two processes. The first is a vitamin B<sub>12</sub>-specific intestinal mechanism using [[intrinsic factor]] through which 1\u20132 micrograms can be absorbed every few hours. The second is a passive diffusion process.<ref name=DRItext/> The human physiology of active vitamin B<sub>12</sub> absorption from food is complex. Protein-bound vitamin B<sub>12</sub> must be released from the proteins by the action of digestive proteases in both the stomach and small intestine. [[Gastric acid]] releases the vitamin from food particles; therefore [[antacid]] and acid-blocking medications (especially [[proton-pump inhibitor]]s) may inhibit absorption of B<sub>12</sub>. After B<sub>12</sub> has been freed from proteins in food by [[pepsin]] in the stomach, [[R-protein]] (also known as haptocorrin and cobalophilin), a B<sub>12</sub> binding protein that is produced in the salivary glands, binds to B<sub>12</sub>. This protects the vitamin from degradation in the acidic environment of the stomach.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Allen RH, Seetharam B, Podell E, Alpers DH | title = Effect of proteolytic enzymes on the binding of cobalamin to R protein and intrinsic factor.

The next binding protein for B<sub>12</sub> is [[intrinsic factor]] (IF), a protein synthesized by gastric [[parietal cell]]s that is secreted in response to [[histamine]], [[gastrin]] and [[pentagastrin]], as well as the presence of food. In the [[duodenum]], [[protease]]s digest R-proteins and release their bound B<sub>12</sub>, which then binds to IF, to form a complex (IF/B<sub>12</sub>). B<sub>12</sub> must be attached to IF for it to be efficiently absorbed, as receptors on the enterocytes in the terminal [[ileum]] of the [[small bowel]] only recognize the B<sub>12</sub>-IF complex; in addition, intrinsic factor protects the vitamin from [[catabolism]] by intestinal bacteria.<ref name=DRItext/>\n\nAbsorption of food vitamin B<sub>12</sub> thus requires an intact and functioning [[stomach]], [[exocrine pancreas]], intrinsic factor, and small bowel.<ref name=DRItext/> Problems with any one of these organs makes a vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency possible. Individuals who lack intrinsic factor have a decreased ability to absorb B<sub>12</sub>. In [[pernicious anemia]], there is a lack of IF due to autoimmune [[atrophic gastritis]], in which antibodies form against parietal cells. Antibodies may alternately form against and bind to IF, inhibiting it from carrying out its B<sub>12</sub> protective function. Due to the complexity of B<sub>12</sub> absorption, geriatric patients, many of whom are hypoacidic due to reduced parietal cell function, have an increased risk of B<sub>12</sub> deficiency.<ref name=combs2008>{{cite book|first=Gerald F. |last=Combs | name-list-format = vanc |title=The vitamins: fundamental aspects in nutrition and health |edition=3rd |publisher=Elsevier Academic Press |location=Amsterdam |year=2008 |pages=381\u2013398 |isbn=978-0-12-183492-0|oclc=150255807}}</ref> This results in 80\u2013100% excretion of oral doses in the feces versus 30\u201360% excretion in feces as seen in individuals with adequate IF.<ref name=combs2008/>\n\nOnce the IF/B<sub>12</sub> complex is recognized by specialized [[cubilin|ileal receptors]], it is transported into the [[portal circulation]]. The vitamin is then transferred to [[transcobalamin II]] (TC-II/B<sub>12</sub>), which serves as the plasma transporter. Hereditary defects in production of the transcobalamins and their receptors may produce functional deficiencies in B<sub>12</sub> and infantile [[megaloblastic anemia]], and abnormal B<sub>12</sub> related biochemistry, even in some cases with normal blood B<sub>12</sub> levels. For the vitamin to serve inside cells, the TC-II/B<sub>12</sub> complex must bind to a cell receptor, and be [[endocytosis|endocytosed]]. The transcobalamin-II is degraded within a [[lysosome]], and free B<sub>12</sub> is finally released into the cytoplasm, where it may be transformed into the proper coenzyme, by certain cellular enzymes (see above).<ref name=DRItext/><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Al-Awami HM, Raja A, Soos MP |title=Physiology, Intrinsic Factor (Gastric Intrinsic Factor) |journal=StatPearls [Internet] |volume= |issue= |pages= |date= August 2019 |pmid=31536261 |doi= |url=}}</ref>\n\nInvestigations into the intestinal absorption of B<sub>12</sub> point out that the upper limit of absorption per single oral dose, under normal conditions, is about 1.5{{nbsp}}\u00b5g.

Approximately 0.1% of this is lost per day by secretions into the gut, as not all these secretions are reabsorbed. [[Bile]] is the main form of B<sub>12</sub> excretion; most of the B<sub>12</sub> secreted in the bile is recycled via [[enterohepatic circulation]]. Excess B<sub>12</sub> beyond the blood's binding capacity is typically excreted in urine. Owing to the extremely efficient enterohepatic circulation of B<sub>12</sub>, the liver can store 3 to 5 years' worth of vitamin B<sub>12</sub>; therefore, nutritional deficiency of this vitamin is rare in adults in the absence of malabsorption disorders.<ref name=DRItext/>\n\n==Production==\n===Biosynthesis===\n{{Main|Cobalamin biosynthesis}}\nVitamin B<sub>12</sub> is derived from a [[tetrapyrrole|tetrapyrrolic structural framework]] created by the enzymes [[Porphobilinogen deaminase|deaminase]] and [[uroporphyrinogen III synthase|cosynthetase]] which transform [[aminolevulinic acid]] via [[porphobilinogen]] and [[hydroxymethylbilane]] to [[uroporphyrinogen III]].

The culture medium for LLD required liver extract. Shorb knew that the same liver extract was used to treat pernicious anemia (her father-in-law had died from the disease), and concluded that LLD could be developed as an assay method to identify the active compound. While at the University of Maryland she received a small grant from [[Merck & Co.|Merck]], and in collaboration with [[Karl Folkers]] from that company, developed the LLD assay. This identified \"LLD factor\" as essential for the bacteria's growth.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ansc.umd.edu/news/annual-events/shorb|title=Mary Shorb Lecture in Nutrition|access-date=March 3, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304085215/https://ansc.umd.edu/news/annual-events/shorb|archive-date=March 4, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> Shorb, Folker and  [[Alexander R.

[[Folate]] levels in the individual may affect the course of pathological changes and symptomatology of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency.  \n{{TOC limit}}\n\n==Definition==\nVitamin B<sub>12</sub>, also known as cobalamin, is a water-soluble vitamin essential to the function of all cells. \"Cobalamin\" actually refers to a group of compounds (corrinoids) with near-identical structure. Cobalamins are characterized by a [[porphyrin]]-like [[corrin]] nucleus that contains a single [[cobalt]] atom bound to a [[benzimidazole|benzimidazolyl]] [[nucleotide]] and a variable residue (R) group. Because these chemical compounds have a similar molecular structure, each of which shows vitamin activity in a vitamin-deficient biological system, they are referred to as [[vitamer]]s. The vitamin activity is as a [[coenzyme]], meaning that its presence is required for enzyme-catalyzed reactions.<ref name=DRItext/><ref name=Banerjee2003 /> For [[cyanocobalamin]], the R-residue is [[cyanide]]. For [[hydroxocobalamin]] it is a hydroxyl group. Both of these can be converted to either of the two cobalamin coenzymes that are active in human metabolism: [[adenosylcobalamin]] (AdoB<sub>12</sub>) and [[methylcobalamin]] (MeB<sub>12</sub>). AdoB<sub>12</sub> has a 5\u2032-deoxyadenosyl group linked to the cobalt atom at the core of the molecule; MeB<sub>12</sub> has a methyl group at that location. These enzymatically active enzyme cofactors function, respectively, in [[mitochondria]] and cell [[cytosol]].<ref name=DRItext/>\n\nCyanocobalamin is a manufactured form with a cyano (cyanide) group bound to cobalt. Bacterial fermentation creates AdoB<sub>12</sub> and MeB<sub>12</sub> which are converted to cyanocobalamin by addition of potassium cyanide in the presence of sodium nitrite and heat. Once consumed, cyanocobalamin is converted to the biologically active AdoB<sub>12</sub> and MeB<sub>12</sub>. Cyanocobalamin is the most common form used in dietary supplements and [[food fortification]] because cyanide stabilizes the molecule from degradation. However, methylcobalamin is also offered as a dietary supplement. [[Hydroxocobalamin]] has a hydroxyl group attached to the cobalt atom. It can be injected intramuscularly to treat Vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency.

It is metabolized in the body to the active [[coenzyme]] forms.<ref name=lpi/> Bacteria are used in commercial production process to synthesize hydroxocobalamin, adenosylcobalamin and methylcobalamin which are then converted to cyanocobalamin by exposure to cyanide (-CN).<ref name=Fang2017/>  \n*'''[[Hydroxocobalamin]]''' is another vitamer of B<sub>12</sub>, commonly encountered in pharmacology. It is sometimes denoted B<sub>12a</sub>. Because it is water soluble it is used for intramuscular or intravenous injection. Hydroxocobalamin is used as an antidote to cyanide poisoning. The cyanide is bound by conversion of hydroxocobalamin to cyanocobalamin, which is then safely excreted in urine. There is some evidence that hydroxocobalamin is converted to the active enzymatic forms of B<sub>12</sub> more easily than cyanocobalamin, so although it is more expensive than cyanocobalamin, it has been used for vitamin replacement in situations where added reassurance of activity is desired. Intramuscular administration of hydroxocobalamin is the preferred treatment for [[pediatric]] patients with intrinsic cobalamin [[metabolic diseases]], for vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficient patients with [[tobacco amblyopia]] (which is thought to perhaps have a component of cyanide poisoning from cyanide in cigarette smoke); and for treatment of patients with pernicious anemia who have optic neuropathy.<ref name=ObeidFedosov />\n*'''[[Adenosylcobalamin]]''' (adoB<sub>12</sub> or AdoCbl) is an enzymatically active cofactor form of B<sub>12</sub> that naturally occurs in the body.

THF plays an important role in DNA synthesis so reduced availability of THF results in ineffective production of cells with rapid turnover, in particular red blood cells, and also intestinal wall cells which are responsible for absorption. [[Tetrahydrofolate|THF]] may be regenerated via MTR or may be obtained from fresh folate in the diet. Thus all of the DNA synthetic effects of B<sub>12</sub> deficiency, including the [[megaloblastic anemia]] of [[pernicious anemia]], resolve if sufficient dietary folate is present. Thus the best-known \"function\" of B<sub>12</sub> (that which is involved with DNA synthesis, cell-division, and anemia) is actually a facultative function which is mediated by B<sub>12</sub>-conservation of an active form of folate which is needed for efficient DNA production.<ref name=Wick1995>{{cite journal | vauthors = Wickramasinghe SN | title = Morphology, biology and biochemistry of cobalamin- and folate-deficient bone marrow cells | journal = Bailli\u00e8re's Clinical Haematology | volume = 8 | issue = 3 | pages = 441\u201359 | date = September 1995 | pmid = 8534956 | doi = 10.1016/S0950-3536(05)80215-X }}</ref> Other cobalamin-requiring methyltransferase enzymes are also known in bacteria, such as Me-H<sub>4</sub>-MPT, coenzyme M methyltransferase.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Marsh EN |title=Coenzyme B12 (cobalamin)-dependent enzymes |journal=Essays Biochem. |volume=34 |issue= |pages=139\u201354 |date=1999 |pmid=10730193 |doi=10.1042/bse0340139 |url=}}</ref>\n\n===Enzyme function===\nIf folate is present in quantity, then of the two absolutely vitamin B<sub>12</sub>-dependent enzyme-family reactions in humans, the [[Methylmalonyl-CoA mutase|MUT]]-family reactions show the most direct and characteristic secondary effects, focusing on the nervous system (see below). This is because the MTR (methyltransferase-type) reactions are involved in regenerating folate, and thus are less evident when folate is in good supply.\n\nSince the late 1990s, folic acid has begun to be added to fortify flour in many countries, so folate deficiency is now more rare. At the same time, since DNA synthetic-sensitive tests for [[anemia]] and [[erythrocyte]] size are routinely done in even simple medical test clinics (so that these folate-mediated biochemical effects are more often directly detected), the [[Methionine synthase|MTR]]-dependent effects of B<sub>12</sub> deficiency are becoming apparent not as anemia due to DNA-synthetic problems (as they were classically), but now mainly as a simple and less obvious elevation of homocysteine in the blood and urine ([[homocysteinuria]]). This condition may result in long-term damage to arteries and in clotting (stroke and heart attack), but this effect is difficult to separate from other common processes associated with atherosclerosis and aging.\n\nThe specific myelin damage resulting from B<sub>12</sub> deficiency, even in the presence of adequate folate and methionine, is more specifically and clearly a vitamin deficiency problem.<ref name=lpi/> It has been connected to B<sub>12</sub> most directly by reactions related to MUT, which is absolutely required to convert methylmalonyl coenzyme A into succinyl coenzyme A. Failure of this second reaction to occur results in elevated levels of MMA, a myelin destabilizer. Excessive MMA will prevent normal [[fatty acid synthesis]], or it will be incorporated into [[fatty acid]]s itself rather than normal [[malonic acid]]. If this abnormal fatty acid subsequently is incorporated into myelin, the resulting myelin will be too fragile, and demyelination will occur. Although the precise mechanism or mechanisms are not known with certainty, the result is [[subacute combined degeneration of spinal cord]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Naidich MJ, Ho SU | title = Case 87: Subacute combined degeneration | journal = Radiology | volume = 237 | issue = 1 | pages = 101\u20135 | date = October 2005 | pmid = 16183926 | doi = 10.1148/radiol.2371031757 }}</ref> Whatever the cause, it is known that B<sub>12</sub> deficiency causes [[neuropathies]], even if folic acid is present in good supply, and therefore anemia is not present.\n\nVitamin B<sub>12</sub>-dependent [[5-methyltetrahydrofolate-homocysteine methyltransferase|MTR]] reactions may also have neurological effects, through an indirect mechanism. Adequate [[methionine]] (which, like folate, must otherwise be obtained in the diet, if it is not regenerated from [[homocysteine]] by a B<sub>12</sub> dependent reaction) is needed to make [[S-Adenosyl methionine|''S''-adenosyl methionine]] (SAMe), which is in turn necessary for methylation of [[myelin]] sheath [[phospholipid]]s. Although production of SAMe is not B<sub>12</sub> dependent, help in recycling for provision of one adequate substrate for it (the [[essential amino acid]] methionine) is assisted by B<sub>12</sub>. In addition, SAMe is involved in the manufacture of certain [[neurotransmitter]]s, [[catecholamine]]s and in brain metabolism. These neurotransmitters are important for maintaining mood, possibly explaining why depression is associated with B<sub>12</sub> deficiency. Methylation of the myelin sheath phospholipids may also depend on adequate folate, which in turn is dependent on MTR recycling, unless ingested in relatively high amounts.\n\n==Physiology==\n===Absorption===\nFood B<sub>12</sub> is absorbed by two processes. The first is a vitamin B<sub>12</sub>-specific intestinal mechanism using [[intrinsic factor]] through which 1\u20132 micrograms can be absorbed every few hours. The second is a passive diffusion process.<ref name=DRItext/> The human physiology of active vitamin B<sub>12</sub> absorption from food is complex. Protein-bound vitamin B<sub>12</sub> must be released from the proteins by the action of digestive proteases in both the stomach and small intestine. [[Gastric acid]] releases the vitamin from food particles; therefore [[antacid]] and acid-blocking medications (especially [[proton-pump inhibitor]]s) may inhibit absorption of B<sub>12</sub>. After B<sub>12</sub> has been freed from proteins in food by [[pepsin]] in the stomach, [[R-protein]] (also known as haptocorrin and cobalophilin), a B<sub>12</sub> binding protein that is produced in the salivary glands, binds to B<sub>12</sub>. This protects the vitamin from degradation in the acidic environment of the stomach.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Allen RH, Seetharam B, Podell E, Alpers DH | title = Effect of proteolytic enzymes on the binding of cobalamin to R protein and intrinsic factor.

The next binding protein for B<sub>12</sub> is [[intrinsic factor]] (IF), a protein synthesized by gastric [[parietal cell]]s that is secreted in response to [[histamine]], [[gastrin]] and [[pentagastrin]], as well as the presence of food. In the [[duodenum]], [[protease]]s digest R-proteins and release their bound B<sub>12</sub>, which then binds to IF, to form a complex (IF/B<sub>12</sub>). B<sub>12</sub> must be attached to IF for it to be efficiently absorbed, as receptors on the enterocytes in the terminal [[ileum]] of the [[small bowel]] only recognize the B<sub>12</sub>-IF complex; in addition, intrinsic factor protects the vitamin from [[catabolism]] by intestinal bacteria.<ref name=DRItext/>\n\nAbsorption of food vitamin B<sub>12</sub> thus requires an intact and functioning [[stomach]], [[exocrine pancreas]], intrinsic factor, and small bowel.<ref name=DRItext/> Problems with any one of these organs makes a vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency possible. Individuals who lack intrinsic factor have a decreased ability to absorb B<sub>12</sub>. In [[pernicious anemia]], there is a lack of IF due to autoimmune [[atrophic gastritis]], in which antibodies form against parietal cells. Antibodies may alternately form against and bind to IF, inhibiting it from carrying out its B<sub>12</sub> protective function. Due to the complexity of B<sub>12</sub> absorption, geriatric patients, many of whom are hypoacidic due to reduced parietal cell function, have an increased risk of B<sub>12</sub> deficiency.<ref name=combs2008>{{cite book|first=Gerald F. |last=Combs | name-list-format = vanc |title=The vitamins: fundamental aspects in nutrition and health |edition=3rd |publisher=Elsevier Academic Press |location=Amsterdam |year=2008 |pages=381\u2013398 |isbn=978-0-12-183492-0|oclc=150255807}}</ref> This results in 80\u2013100% excretion of oral doses in the feces versus 30\u201360% excretion in feces as seen in individuals with adequate IF.<ref name=combs2008/>\n\nOnce the IF/B<sub>12</sub> complex is recognized by specialized [[cubilin|ileal receptors]], it is transported into the [[portal circulation]]. The vitamin is then transferred to [[transcobalamin II]] (TC-II/B<sub>12</sub>), which serves as the plasma transporter. Hereditary defects in production of the transcobalamins and their receptors may produce functional deficiencies in B<sub>12</sub> and infantile [[megaloblastic anemia]], and abnormal B<sub>12</sub> related biochemistry, even in some cases with normal blood B<sub>12</sub> levels. For the vitamin to serve inside cells, the TC-II/B<sub>12</sub> complex must bind to a cell receptor, and be [[endocytosis|endocytosed]].

The total amount of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> stored in body is about 2\u20135{{nbsp}}mg in adults. Around 50% of this is stored in the liver. Approximately 0.1% of this is lost per day by secretions into the gut, as not all these secretions are reabsorbed. [[Bile]] is the main form of B<sub>12</sub> excretion; most of the B<sub>12</sub> secreted in the bile is recycled via [[enterohepatic circulation]]. Excess B<sub>12</sub> beyond the blood's binding capacity is typically excreted in urine. Owing to the extremely efficient enterohepatic circulation of B<sub>12</sub>, the liver can store 3 to 5 years' worth of vitamin B<sub>12</sub>; therefore, nutritional deficiency of this vitamin is rare in adults in the absence of malabsorption disorders.<ref name=DRItext/>\n\n==Production==\n===Biosynthesis===\n{{Main|Cobalamin biosynthesis}}\nVitamin B<sub>12</sub> is derived from a [[tetrapyrrole|tetrapyrrolic structural framework]] created by the enzymes [[Porphobilinogen deaminase|deaminase]] and [[uroporphyrinogen III synthase|cosynthetase]] which transform [[aminolevulinic acid]] via [[porphobilinogen]] and [[hydroxymethylbilane]] to [[uroporphyrinogen III]].

Public awareness of the existence of the minigame arrived with the release of the ''Hot Coffee'' [[Mod (computer gaming)|mod]], created for the [[Microsoft Windows]] port of ''GTA: San Andreas'' in 2005. This mod enables access to the minigame.\n\nThe minigame portrays animated [[sexual intercourse]] between the main character, [[Carl \"CJ\" Johnson]], and his chosen in-game [[girlfriend]]. The name of the mod is derived from the girlfriend's offer for the main character to come into her home for \"coffee,\" a euphemism for sex.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2009/12/page_six_reveals_coastal_dispa.html|title=Coffee Means Something Totally Different in Los Angeles Than It Does in New York|website=Intelligencer|language=en-us|access-date=2020-04-21}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the \"Hot Coffee\" minigame was completely disabled and its existence was only highlighted after the mod's release for the PC version on June 9, 2005,<ref name=ModRelease>{{cite web | url = http://patrickw.gtagames.nl/mods.html | title = Hot Coffee mod developer's mod listing | work = PatrickW's modding website | accessdate = July 5, 2006}}</ref> the assets for the minigame were also discovered in both the [[PlayStation 2]] and [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] versions of the game, and people found ways to enable the minigame via console video game hacking tools. By the middle of July 2005, the minigame's discovery attracted considerable [[Video game controversy|controversy]] from lawmakers and some members of the public, prompting the game to be re-assessed with an \"[[List of AO-rated video games|Adults Only (AO)]]\" [[Video game ratings system|rating]] by the U.S. [[Entertainment Software Rating Board]] (ESRB), and refused classification in Australia, resulting in its removal from sale.\n\nAn updated version of ''San Andreas'' was later released with the minigame removed completely, allowing the game to regain its original rating. A [[Patch (computing)|patch]] for the original version of the game, Cold Coffee, was designed to counter edit the script and disable the minigame and crash the game if one attempts to access it.<ref name=nomoarcoffee>{{cite web | url = http://www.nomorehotcoffee.com/ | title = No More Hot Coffee | work = [[Rockstar Games]] | accessdate =  15 September 2016}}</ref>\n\n== Minigame overview and ''Hot Coffee'' mod ==\n{{Tone|date=November 2008}}\nThroughout the game, [[Carl \"CJ\" Johnson]], the game's protagonist, may date up to six [[girlfriend]]s, carrying out various \"date missions\" in order to improve his relationship with a particular woman. Once CJ has become particularly close to a girlfriend, or if he has collected all oysters in the game, his girlfriend may end a successful date by inviting him into her house for \"coffee,\" from which CJ may choose to accept or decline. Improving relationships with girlfriends through successful dates and other related activities will eventually reward CJ with new items, such as vehicles and special wardrobes, along with pre-existing gameplay benefits (e.g. dating a nurse grants CJ with free visits to the hospital without losing his weapons after dying).\n\nIn the unmodified version of ''[[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas]]'', players see an exterior view of the girlfriend's house while muffled voices of CJ and his girlfriend engaging in [[sexual intercourse]] are heard. However, the Hot Coffee mod replaces this with a [[minigame]] which allows the player to actually enter the girlfriend's bedroom and control Carl's actions during sex, with the same controls as dancing.\n\n[[Rockstar Games]], the publisher of the ''[[Grand Theft Auto]]'' series, initially denied allegations that the minigame was \"hidden\" in the video game, stating that the ''Hot Coffee'' modification (which they claim violated the game's [[software license|End User License Agreement]]) is the result of \"[[Hacker (computer security)|hackers]]\" making \"significant technical modifications to and [[reverse engineering]]\" the game's code.<ref name=baertlein>{{cite web | url = https://news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&u=/nm/20050714/us_nm/media_grandtheftauto_dc_2 | title = 'Grand Theft' maker blames hackers for sex scenes | work = [[Reuters]] | accessdate = 13 July 2005 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20050305201757/http://news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story | archive-date = 2005-03-05 | url-status = dead }}</ref> However, this claim was undermined when a user known as \"gothi\" from the website PS2 Save Tools released the \"GTA:SA Censor Remover\" tool for the [[PlayStation 2]] and [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] versions in June 2005, which allowed the minigame to be accessed on consoles. These new methods of accessing the mod demonstrated that the controversial content was, indeed, built into the console versions as well.\n\nThe PC mod itself is only an edited copy of the main game script file (\"main.scm\") with a single [[bit]] changed. The mod was also made possible on the console versions by changing the bit inside a user's saved game file or by using a third-party modding device. Take-Two has stated that the mod constitutes a violation of the End User License Agreement,<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20051017024339/http://ir.take2games.com/ReleaseDetail.cfm?ReleaseID=169278 Take-Two Games - Investor Relations General Information]</ref> even though modification of the main.scm file is common within the mod community.\n\nHowever, the oral sex animations are clearly visible in the background during one scene of the mission \"Cleaning the Hood,\" even in the re-released game.<ref name=\"Norway\">{{cite web | url = http://pub.tv2.no/nettavisen/it/article432538.ece | title = Nye sex-avsl\u00f8ringer i drapsspill |trans-title=New sex revelations in murder game | work = [[Nettavisen]] | date = 5 August 2005 | language = Norwegian | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160416042146/http://pub.nettavisen.no/432538.html | archivedate = 16 April 2016}}</ref> This explains why the minigame was not simply removed when the decision was made to cut it from the game; its assets were already in use elsewhere.<ref name=\"romblog\">{{cite web | url = http://www.romsteady.net/blog/2005/07/my-take-on-hot-coffee.html | title = My Take On \"Hot Coffee\" | work = Rom's Rants | accessdate =  14 June 2006}}</ref><ref name=\"OpenLearn\">{{cite web | url = https://www.open.edu/openlearn/science-maths-technology/computing-and-ict/computing/getting-hot-water-over-hot-coffee | title = Getting into Hot Water over Hot Coffee | work = OpenLearn | accessdate =  12 Dec 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Controversy ==\n{{wikinewspar2|Video game's secret sex scenes spark outrage|Grand Theft Auto under fire}}\nThe revelation of the minigame sparked a fair amount of controversy around ''Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas'', with some politicians firing harsh words at both the game's developer and the [[Entertainment Software Rating Board]] (ESRB), the organization which establishes content ratings for video games in North America.

Public awareness of the existence of the mini-game arrived with the release of the ''Hot Coffee'' [[Mod (computer gaming)|mod]], created for the [[Microsoft Windows]] port of ''GTA: San Andreas'' in 2005. This mod enables access to the mini-game.\n\nThe mini-game portrays animated [[sexual intercourse]] between the main character, [[Carl \"CJ\" Johnson]], and his chosen in-game [[girlfriend]]. The name of the mod is derived from the girlfriend's offer for the main character to come into her home for \"coffee,\" a euphemism for sex.\n\nAlthough the \"Hot Coffee\" mini-game was completely disabled and its existence was only highlighted after the mod's release for the PC version on June 9, 2005,<ref name=ModRelease>{{cite web | url = http://patrickw.gtagames.nl/mods.html | title = Hot Coffee mod developer's mod listing | work = PatrickW's modding website | accessdate = July 5, 2006}}</ref> the assets for the mini-game were also discovered in both the [[PlayStation 2]] and [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] versions of the game, and people found ways to enable the mini-game via console video game hacking tools. By the middle of July 2005, the mini-game's discovery attracted considerable [[Video game controversy|controversy]] from lawmakers and some members of the public, prompting the game to be re-assessed with an \"[[List of AO-rated video games|Adults Only (AO)]]\" [[Video game ratings system|rating]] by the U.S. [[Entertainment Software Rating Board]] (ESRB), and refused classification in Australia, resulting in its removal from sale.\n\nAn updated version of ''San Andreas'' was later released with the mini-game removed completely, allowing the game to regain its original rating. A [[Patch (computing)|patch]] for the original version of the game, Cold Coffee, was designed to counter edit the script and disable the mini-game and crash the game if one attempts to access it.<ref name=nomoarcoffee>{{cite web | url = http://www.nomorehotcoffee.com/ | title = No More Hot Coffee | work = [[Rockstar Games]] | accessdate =  15 September 2016}}</ref>\n\n== Minigame overview and ''Hot Coffee'' mod ==\n{{Tone|date=November 2008}}\nThroughout the game, [[Carl \"CJ\" Johnson]], the game's protagonist, may date up to six [[girlfriend]]s, carrying out various \"date missions\" in order to improve his relationship with a particular woman. Once CJ has become particularly close to a girlfriend, or if he has collected all oysters in the game, his girlfriend may end a successful date by inviting him into her house for \"coffee,\" from which CJ may choose to accept or decline. Improving relationships with girlfriends through successful dates and other related activities will eventually reward CJ with new items, such as vehicles and special wardrobes, along with pre-existing gameplay benefits (e.g. dating a nurse grants CJ with free visits to the hospital without losing his weapons after dying).\n\nIn the unmodified version of ''[[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas]]'', players see an exterior view of the girlfriend's house while muffled voices of CJ and his girlfriend engaging in [[sexual intercourse]] are heard. However, the Hot Coffee mod replaces this with a minigame which allows the player to actually enter the girlfriend's bedroom and control Carl's actions during sex, with the same controls as dancing.\n\n[[Rockstar Games]], the publisher of the ''[[Grand Theft Auto]]'' series, initially denied allegations that the mini-game was \"hidden\" in the video game, stating that the ''Hot Coffee'' modification (which they claim violated the game's [[software license|End User License Agreement]]) is the result of \"[[Hacker (computer security)|hackers]]\" making \"significant technical modifications to and [[reverse engineering]]\" the game's code.<ref name=baertlein>{{cite web | url = https://news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&u=/nm/20050714/us_nm/media_grandtheftauto_dc_2 | title = 'Grand Theft' maker blames hackers for sex scenes | work = [[Reuters]] | accessdate = 13 July 2005 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20050305201757/http://news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story | archive-date = 2005-03-05 | url-status = dead }}</ref> However, this claim was undermined when a user known as \"gothi\" from the website PS2 Save Tools released the \"GTA:SA Censor Remover\" tool for the [[PlayStation 2]] and [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] versions in June 2005, which allowed the minigame to be accessed on consoles. These new methods of accessing the mod demonstrated that the controversial content was, indeed, built into the console versions as well.\n\nThe PC mod itself is only an edited copy of the main game script file (\"main.scm\") with a single [[bit]] changed. The mod was also made possible on the console versions by changing the bit inside a user's saved game file or by using a third-party modding device.

The game was already rated \"18+\" by [[Pan European Game Information|PEGI]] prior to the release of the mod.

Many older musical forms remain and are used in both traditional performances that have been attuned to the ideas and the way of life of the modern North Korean communist state and to accompany modern songs in praise of Kim Il-sung, his son and successor, Kim Jong-il, and Kim Jong-un from 2012 onward, plus songs that wish for a reunited Korea, thus creating a mix of traditional and Western music that is truly North Korean, a unique variant of Korean music as a whole mixing the old and the new.\n\nThe modern Ongnyugeum zithers and the [[Sohaegeum]] four stringed fiddle are North Korean modernized versions of traditional Korean musical instruments, both used in traditional and modern musical forms.\n\nMilitary music, in contrast, often makes extensive use of Western brass, woodwind, and percussion instruments, often omitting the Korean ones entirely. Although usually original compositions, the melodies are not easily distinguishable from Western ones in the absence of their lyrics, which heavily feature the customary ideologically oriented content.\n\n== Active musical groups and ensembles ==\n{{further|List of North Korean musicians}}\n===Military===\n* [[Song and Dance Ensemble of the Korean People's Army]]\n* [[Korean People's Army State Merited Chorus and Symphony Orchestra]]\n* [[Song and Dance Ensemble of the Korean People's Navy]]\n* [[Song and Dance Ensemble of the Korean People's Air Force]]\n* [[Song and Dance Ensemble of the Ministry of People's Security of the DPRK]]\n* [[Central Military Band of the Korean People's Army]]\n* [[Women's Military Marching Band of the Department of People's Security of the DPRK]]\n\n===Civilian===\n* [[Unhasu Orchestra|Unhasu National Orchestra]]\n* [[State Symphony Orchestra of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea]]\n* [[Isang Yun Orchestra|Isang Yun Symphony Orchestra]]\n* [[Pochonbo Electronic Ensemble]]\n* [[Wangjaesan Light Music Band]] and [[Wangjaesan Dance Troupe]]\n* [[Moranbong Band]]\n* [[Chongbong Band]]<ref name=\"app._N.Ko\">{{Cite web | title = N.

Appliances are pre-installed, pre-configured, system images. This spin was intended to make it easier for anyone (developers, [[independent software vendor]]s (ISV), [[original equipment manufacturer]]s (OEM), etc.) to create and deploy [[virtual appliance]]s.\n\n=== Spins and Remixes ===\nThe Fedora project officially distributes different variations called \"Fedora Spins\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://spins.fedoraproject.org/index.html.en|title=Fedora Spins|website=spins.fedoraproject.org}}</ref> which are Fedora with different desktop environments (GNOME is the default desktop environment). The current official spins, as of Fedora 30, are KDE, XFCE, LXQT, Mate-Compiz, Cinnamon, LXDE, and SOAS.\n\nIn addition to Spins, which are official variants of the Fedora system, the project allows unofficial variants to use the term \"Fedora Remix\" without asking for further permission, although a different logo (provided) is required.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Remix|title=Remix - Fedora Project Wiki|website=fedoraproject.org}}</ref>\n\nSome examples are \"Kannolo\", which is a Fedora KDE remix that omits anything that depends on the GTK toolkit from the default system, and [[Russian Fedora Remix]], which is a variant that ships software which is encumbered by US patent laws or would violate Fedora's policy of not including non-free software by default.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sourceforge.net/projects/kannolo/|title=Kannolo|website=SourceForge}}</ref>\n\n=== Architectures ===\n[[x86-32]], [[x86-64]] and [[ARM architecture|ARM-hfp]] are the primary architectures supported by Fedora.<ref name=\"Architectures\" /> Pidora<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pidora.ca|title=Pidora - Raspberry Pi Fedora Remix|publisher=pidora.ca|accessdate=18 March 2015}}</ref> and FedBerry<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fedberry.org|title=FedBerry - Fedora Remix for Raspberry Pi 2/3 | publisher=fedberry.org|accessdate=23 March 2017}}</ref> are specialized Fedora distributions for the [[Raspberry Pi]], which support the Raspberry Pi as well as other ARM and [[Single-board computer|SBC]] devices.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Architectures/ARM#Supported_Hardware_and_Devices|title=Fedora ARM Supported Devices|last=|first=|date=|website=Fedora ARM Supported Devices|access-date=}}</ref> As of release 26, Fedora also supports [[AArch64|ARM AArch64]], [[Power ISA|IBM Power64]], [[Power ISA|IBM Power64le]], [[Z/Architecture|IBM Z]] (\"s390x\"), [[MIPS architecture|MIPS-64el]], [[MIPS architecture|MIPS-el]], [[RISC-V]] as secondary architectures.\n\nFedora 28 was the last release that supported ppc64 and users are advised to move to the little endian [[ppc64le]] variant.<ref name=\"Fedora PPC64\" />\n\n=== Alternatives ===\nThe Fedora Project also distributes several other versions<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://alt.fedoraproject.org/|title=Fedora Alternative Downloads|last=|first=|date=|website=Fedora Alternative Downloads|access-date=}}</ref> with less use cases than mentioned above, like network installers and minimal installation images. They are intended for special cases and/or expert users that want to have custom installations or configuring Fedora from scratch.\nIn addition, all acceptable licenses for Fedora (including copyright, trademark, and patent licenses) must be applicable not only to Red Hat or Fedora, but also to all recipients downstream.

In 1988 the Congress further expanded the judicial reform program to allow police assistance to promote investigative and forensic skills, develop law enforcement training curricula, and improve administration and management of law enforcement organizations. This act specifically prohibited the Department of Defense (DOD) and the U.S. armed forces from providing training under this program.<ref name=\"ISD1985\" />\n\nMaritime subjects were exempted from the section 660 prohibition, as well as the prohibition for any country that has a long-standing democratic tradition, does not have armed forces, and does not engage in a consistent pattern of gross violations of human rights. The act permitted such countries to receive any type of police assistance.\n\n*International Narcotics Control Acts\nThis series of acts approved certain police assistance activities in [[Latin America]] and the Caribbean for narcotics control purposes. The 1988 act expanded DOD's role and allowed it to provide training and weapons and ammunition in fiscal years 1989 and 1990 to foreign police units that are specifically organized for narcotics enforcement in eligible countries in Latin America and the Caribbean. This act also allowed economic support funds to be provided to Colombian police for the protection of judges, government officials, and members of the press against narco-terrorist attacks. The 1989 Act extended DOD's authority to train police units in [[Bolivia]], [[Colombia]], and [[Peru]] in fiscal year 1990, if the units are only for narcotics enforcement.  It also allowed DOD to provide, in addition to weapons and ammunition, other defense articles such as helicopters, vehicles, radios, and personnel gear.\nThe 1990 act authorized DOD to continue to train and equip police forces in the [[Andes|Andean region]].<ref name=\"GAO1992-03-05IntNarc\"/>\n*Urgent Assistance for Democracy in Panama Act of 1990 \u2013 after the U.S. invasion of [[Panama]], the Congress significantly enhanced the U.S. role in the development of the new police force in Panama.

For example, the President may authorize foreign assistance when `it is important to the security interests of the United States'. This allows the President to waive any provision of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, including section 660.<ref>Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, 22 USC 2364</ref>\n\n===U.S. assistance provided to foreign police===\n\n====Antiterrorism assistance====\n\nThis aims to improve foreign governments' antiterrorist capabilities to better protect U.S. citizens and interests.<ref name=\"GAO1992-03-05App2AT\" /> In 1990, the U.S. provided assistance to 49 countries at a cost of nearly $10 million. Sixty-two percent of the funds were spent in Latin America, the Caribbean, and Europe, and less than $500,000 was used to purchase equipment. The Department of State manages the program and contracts with other U.S. government agencies, state or local police departments, and private firms to conduct the training. The [[Federal Aviation Administration]],<ref name=\"GAO1992-03-05App2AT\" /> U.S. [[Customs Service]], the [[Immigration and Naturalization Service]], the [[Federal Law Enforcement Training Center]], and the [[U.S. Marshals Service]] are regular trainers. In compliance with legislative requirements, most training takes place in the United States.\n\n====International narcotics control====\n\nOne of the objectives of the Department of State Bureau of International Narcotics Matters (INM) international narcotics control training program is to strengthen host country enforcement and interdiction capabilities.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} During fiscal year 1990, INM provided a minimum of $45 million in training and equipment to foreign police, principally in [[Mexico]], [[Jamaica]], [[Colombia]], [[Ecuador]], [[Peru]], [[Bolivia]], [[Brazil]], [[Venezuela]], [[Pakistan]], [[Thailand]], and [[Turkey]]. These are all narcotics producing and trafficking countries.\n\nINM reimburses other U.S. government agencies, primarily the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), Customs, and Coast Guard, to conduct the actual training. DEA provides narcotics investigative training, Customs teaches air, sea and land port search procedures, and [[Coast Guard]] teaches courses in maritime interdiction. Other agencies may also be requested to train on a reimbursable basis in areas where they have specific expertise. For example, DOD provides helicopter training to police in drug trafficking countries. Training is conducted both overseas and in the United States and is reviewed and approved by INM.<ref name=\"GAO1992-03-05IntNarc\">{{citation\n | title = Foreign Aid: Police Training and Assistance; report to Congressional requesters\n | author = U.S. General Accounting Office, National Security and International Affairs Division\n | date=5 March 1992\n | chapter = Appendix II.

Documents provided by DOD show that in fiscal year 1990, DOD provided training and equipment with a value of at least $17 million to Mexico, $1.3 million to Bolivia, $10 million to Colombia, $1 million to Ecuador, and $1 million to Peru. DOD officials informed us that training and equipment valued at more than these amounts may also have been provided. However, documentation was not available at the Washington, D.C., agency headquarters level that specified the amounts for law enforcement activities. The equipment provided consisted of UH-1 helicopters and spare parts, ammunition, small arms, riot control equipment, radios, and miscellaneous personal gear.\n\n====Investigative and international police training====\nIn FY1986,  AID transferred funds to DOJ to design, develop, and implement projects to improve and enhance the investigative capabilities of law enforcement agencies in the Latin America and the Caribbean region. This was part of AID's effort to reform judicial systems. Using these funds, DOJ established the International Criminal Investigative Training Assistance Program (ICITAP).<ref name=\"GAO1992-03-05Train\">{{citation\n | title = Foreign Aid: Police Training and Assistance; report to Congressional requesters\n | author = U.S. General Accounting Office, National Security and International Affairs Division\n | date=5 March 1992\n | chapter =INVESTIGATIVE AND INTERNATIONAL POLICE TRAINING\n | chapter-url = https://fas.org/irp/gao/920300-train.htm}}</ref> Operating under State Department oversight, ICITAP has conducted criminal justice sector needs assessments in the region and has expanded its training to include basic police management and police academy development. In fiscal year 1990, ICITAP received $7 million from the Department of State for its regional program. It trained more than 1,000 students from the Caribbean, Central and South America and sponsored 7 conferences. Training includes police management, criminal investigation, crime scene search, and forensic medicine courses. Except for students sent to training programs in the United States, ICITAP training takes place overseas.\n\nThe [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) also provides limited training for foreign law enforcement officials.<ref name=\"GAO1992-03-05Train\" /> Each year approximately 100 international police officials attend the 11-week college level course at the FBI National Academy that includes studies on management and forensic sciences. The FBI pays for the training and subsistence, but does not pay for the students' transportation. Over the last 10 years, more than 1,100 foreign police officials from 89 countries have graduated from this course.\n\nUsing its own funds, the FBI created two training courses:\n*Training for Mexican police to better assist the United States in its investigations. Mexican officers receive a 3-day course in basic law enforcement techniques to include crime scene management, collection and preservation of evidence, hostage negotiations, forensic science, and investigative techniques. Since 1987, over 400 Mexican border police have been trained. FBI officials stated that the FBI plans to establish a training school in Mexico during 1992 at an estimated cost of about $250,000 annually, excluding salaries.\n*The second course developed by the FBI for foreign police was to provide mid-level management training for police officials from the Pacific Island nations. The 4-week course includes first-line supervision, investigative techniques, and hostage negotiations. During 1991, 52 students graduated from the course held in [[Guam]] at a cost to the FBI of about $35,000. About 50 students are expected to attend this course during the spring of 1992.\n\nThe FBI also provides other training and assistance to foreign police as requested, but the cost is unknown.<ref name=\"GAO1992-03-05Train\" /> For example, the [[National Center for the Analysis of Violent Crime]] provided training to [[Canada|Canadian]] police. The Criminal Investigative Division conducted a training seminar for officers from Italy's three national law enforcement agencies on the use of sensitive investigative techniques such as the operation of confidential sources, undercover operations, and electronic surveillance. The FBI also furnishes on-the-job assistance to governments who request help during particularly difficult or sensitive investigations.\n\n====Counterterrorism and military assistance====\nDOD supplies a limited amount of military training and assistance to police officials. During fiscal years 1986 and 1987, DOD trained and equipped the El Salvadoran and Honduran police to counter urban terrorist activities.<ref name=\"GAO1992-03-05Train\" /><ref name=\"GAO1992-03-05CTMA\">{{citation\n | title = Foreign Aid: Police Training and Assistance; report to Congressional requesters\n | author = U.S. General Accounting Office, National Security and International Affairs Division\n | date=5 March 1992\n | chapter =COUNTERTERRORISM AND MILITARY ASSISTANCE\n | chapter-url = https://fas.org/irp/gao/920300-train.htm}}</ref>\n\nThis assistance was authorized in response to the murder of U.S. Marines by terrorists in El Salvador and was managed and delivered by the U.S. Army Military Police. The assistance consisted of training in counterterrorism techniques and the supply of police vehicles, communications, weapons, and other equipment. This effort cost $19.8 million, of which $17 million was provided to El Salvador.\n\nIn fiscal year 1990, DOD spent $6.4 million in previously authorized but unused military assistance funds to purchase needed equipment and weapons for Panama's newly formed national police force. Items procured included police vehicles, communications equipment, small arms, and personal gear. This assistance was a one-time, emergency program.\n\nDOD has an ongoing military assistance program to support Costa Rican police. In fiscal year 1990, DOD supplied $431,000 in military equipment and $232,000 in military training to the Costa Rican Civil Guard to help them carry out their responsibility to protect the border regions of the country. DOD provided equipment such as vehicles, personnel gear, and radios, and military training in areas such as coastal operations. Additionally, DOD conducted technical training courses in equipment maintenance and medical skills among others.<ref name=\"GAO1992-03-05CTMA\" />\n\nDOD, along with the United Kingdom, supports the Eastern Caribbean Regional Security System<ref name=\"CIP\">{{citation \n | url = http://ciponline.org/facts/ecr03.htm\n | author = Center for International Policy\n | title = Eastern Caribbean Overview\n}}</ref>{{failed verification|date=July 2015}} that was formed after the U.S. intervention in [[Grenada]]. The Security System is composed of a few permanently assigned military officers, but largely depends upon island nation police officers who can be called up for military duty in case of emergency. The United States equips and trains these personnel to prepare them for such an eventually. In fiscal year 1990, DOD provided $4.2 million in military assistance funds that were used to purchase equipment such as jeeps, small arms, uniforms, and communications gear. DOD also provided $300,000 for training in special operations, rural patrol, field survival, and surveillance, as well as technical courses in communications, navigation, maintenance, and medicine.\n\n====Difficulties in determining cost and extent of assistance====\nSince some agencies fund assistance out of their own budgets, without necessarily having a line item for police assistance, the GAO \"could not accurately determine the extent or cost of assistance to foreign police\" In the GAO estimates, \"some double counting of students may be occurring and agencies may not be differentiating between assistance provided to police and assistance provided to the military.\" This might happen when \"the agency supplying the training and the agency paying for the training may both include the trainees in their reporting systems, such as when ICITAP pays for students attending the FBI academy.\"\n\nWhile the DOJ was asked to calculate information on its work with foreign police, it could not assign a dollar value to items including \"travel expenses, salaries, and expendable items such as course materials.\" H.<ref name=\"GAO1992-03-05PolAsst\">{{citation\n | title = Foreign Aid: Police Training and Assistance; report to Congressional requesters\n | author = U.S. General Accounting Office, National Security and International Affairs Division\n | date=5 March 1992\n | chapter = Appendix II.

For example, training provided to the Eastern Caribbean Regional Security System was for law enforcement personnel, although a few trainees may have belonged to military organizations.\"\n\n==Human experimentation==\n{{more citations needed section|date=March 2014}}\nProject [[MKULTRA]], or [[MK-ULTRA]], was the code name for a CIA mind-control research program that began in 1950, involved primarily with the experimentation of drugs and other \"chemical, biological and radiological\" stimuli on both willing and uninformed subjects.<ref>[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=471+U.S.+159&hl=en&as_sdt=2,33&case=16297847318525168348&scilh=0 CIA v. Sims], 471 U.S. 159, 161\u2013162 (1985)</ref>\n\n===Rockefeller Commission===\nIn December 1974, ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that the CIA had conducted illegal domestic activities, including experiments on U.S. citizens, during the 1960s. The report prompted investigations by both the U.S. Congress (in the form of the [[Church Committee]]) and a presidential commission (known as the [[United States President's Commission on CIA activities within the United States|Rockefeller Commission]]). The congressional investigations and the Rockefeller Commission report revealed that the CIA and the Department of Defense had in fact conducted experiments to influence and control human behavior through the use of psychoactive drugs such as [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]] and [[mescaline]] and other chemical, biological, and psychological means. Experiments were often conducted without the subjects' knowledge or consent.\n\nMK-ULTRA was started on the order of CIA director [[Allen Dulles]], largely in response to alleged Soviet, Chinese, and North Korean use of mind-control techniques on U.S. prisoners of war in Korea. The goal of the experiments was to study mind-control in order to develop methods of interrogation and behavior modification and manipulation, as well as to develop a possible [[truth drug]].\n\n===Outcome===\n[[MK-ULTRA]] research ultimately proved useless to the CIA and they have abandoned the program. Because most MK-ULTRA records were deliberately destroyed in 1973 by order of then CIA Director [[Richard Helms]], it is difficult if not impossible to have a complete understanding of the more than 150 individually funded research sub-projects sponsored by MK-ULTRA and related CIA programs.\n\nFollowing the recommendations of the [[Church Committee]], President Gerald Ford in 1976 issued the first [[Executive Order]] on Intelligence Activities which, among other things, prohibited \"experimentation with drugs on human subjects, except with the informed consent, in writing and witnessed by a disinterested party, of each such human subject\" and in accordance with the guidelines issued by the National Commission. Subsequent orders by Presidents Carter and [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]] expanded the directive to apply to any human experimentation.\n\n==Assassination and targeted killing==\n{{Main|Targeted killing}}\n:''See [[United States involvement in regime change]]\n\n===Targeted Killing===\n{{Main|Drone strike|Disposition Matrix}}\n{{Seealso|Civilian casualties from U.S. drone strikes}}\n[[File:Graph of Average Casualties in US Drone Strikes in Yemen 2002-present.png|thumb|270px|Graph of average casualties in drone strikes ordered by the United States in [[Yemen]], 2002-Present.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lb1hEYJ_omI8lSe33izwS2a2lbiygs0hTp2Al_Kz5KQ/edit#gid=1277572900|title=US strikes in Yemen, 2002 to present|work=Google Docs|language=en}}</ref>]]\nAt least since World War II, a distinction has been drawn between assassination of civilian leaders, and [[targeted killing]]s of leaders of fighting organizations. Some cases were blurry, such as the British-Czech [[Operation Anthropoid]], the killing of uniformed SS officer [[Reinhard Heydrich]], the acting [[Reichsprotektor]] of [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia|The Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]]. A failed attempt, by British troops, to kill [[Field Marshal]] [[Erwin Rommel]] was clearly aimed at a military leader, as was the successful shooting down of [[Admiral]] [[Death of Isoroku Yamamoto|Isoroku Yamamoto]].\n\nCIA has admitted being involved in assassination attempts against foreign leaders. Recently, there have been targeted killings of suspected terrorists, typically with missiles fired from [[unmanned aerial vehicles]], in a manner that a number of legal authorities believe was a legitimate act as opposed to a prohibited assassination.\n\n===Assassinations===\nOf the cases cited, it appears that no CIA personnel or even directly controlled foreign agents personally killed any leader, but there certainly were cases where the CIA knew of, or supported, plots to overthrow foreign leaders. In the cases of Lumumba in 1960/61 and Castro in the 50s and 60s, the CIA was involved in preparing to kill the individual. In other cases, such as Diem, the Agency knew of a plot but did not warn him, and communications at White House level indicated that the Agency had, with approval, told the plotters the US didn't object to their plan. The gun or poison, however, was not in the hands of a CIA officer.\n\nCIA personnel were involved in attempted assassinations of foreign government leaders such as [[Fidel Castro]]. They provided support to those that killed [[Patrice Lumumba]]. In yet another category was noninterference in the Republic of Vietnam (South Vietnam) ''[[Coup d'\u00e9tat]]'' in which President [[Ngo Dinh Diem]] was killed.\n\nA distinction has been drawn between political assassinations and [[CIA transnational anti-terrorism activities#Targeted killing in war versus assassination|\"targeted killing\" of leaders of non-state belligerents]].\n\n====Castro====\n{{main|Assassination attempts on Fidel Castro}}\n[[File:Sam Giancana.jpg|thumb|190px|The CIA recruited [[Sam Giancana]] (pictured), [[Santo Trafficante, Jr.|Santo Trafficante]] and other mobsters to assassinate Fidel Castro.<ref>{{cite news |last=Snow |first=Anita |date=June 27, 2007 |title=CIA Plot to Kill Castro Detailed|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/27/AR2007062700190.html |newspaper=The Washington Post |location=Washington, DC|agency=AP }}</ref>]]\nPerhaps the best-documented account of CIA-sponsored assassination plans were against [[President (government title)|President]] [[Fidel Castro]] of [[Cuba]].\n\nAccording to columnist Jack Anderson,<ref name=\"Anderson1971-06-18\">{{citation\n | journal = Washington Post\n | first = Jack | last = Anderson | authorlink = Jack Anderson (columnist)\n | date = 18 June 1971\n | page = B7\n | title = 6 Attempts to Kill Castro laid to CIA\n}}</ref> the first attempt was part of the [[Bay of Pigs Invasion]] operation, but five more teams were sent, the last apprehended on a rooftop within rifle range of Castro, at the end of February or beginning of March 1963.

The assassination attempts started under the presidency of [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] and continued under [[John F. Kennedy]] and [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]. Most attempts were made during [[Richard Nixon]]\u2019s presidency. When Castro travelled abroad, the CIA cooperated with Cuban exiles for some of the more serious assassination attempts. In 2000, when Castro was due to visit Panama, a plot was hatched to put explosives under the podium where he was due to speak.

While the US had no direct participation in the coup, the plotters were told, in a deniable way, that the US did not object to it. No documentary evidence has surfaced that the US knew that Diem and his brother were to be killed, and it is unclear that all the Vietnamese plotters knew or agreed to it. [[President (government title)|President]] [[John F. Kennedy]] was aware of the coup plans, but apparently had not considered the hazard to Diem.\n\nAccording to the ''Pentagon Papers'', the final US loss of confidence in Diem began when his government violently suppressed a protest on Buddha's Birthday, 8 May 1963. Up to that point, the majority Buddhists had not been very politically active, even though Diem had given preference to the Catholic minority. Quickly, however, the Buddhists put a \"cohesive and disciplined [political] organization\" into action. By June, the situation moved from dissidence from a religious group to a \"grave crisis of public confidence\".<ref name=\"PP2-4-201\">{{citation\n | title = The Pentagon Papers, Gravel Edition, Volume 2\n | chapter = Chapter 4, \"The Overthrow of Ngo Dinh Diem, May\u2013November, 1963\" \n | pages = 201\u2013276\n | publisher = Beacon Press\n | year = 1971 \n | chapter-url = http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/pentagon2/pent6.htm}}</ref>\n\nThen-Ambassador [[Frederick Nolting]] had tried to persuade Diem to moderate government action against Buddhists, but with no success. While Nolting was on leave, [[President (government title)|President]] [[John F. Kennedy]] appointed [[Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr.]] as the new Ambassador. In June 1963, senior leaders began, for the first time, to discuss the effect of a coup to remove Diem. Nolting and the US military in Vietnam, however, argued that Diem was keeping chaos at bay. Nolting left permanently in mid-August, but the assurances from Diem died with multiple August 21 night raids on Buddhist temples in many parts of Vietnam. Two days later, a US representative was approached by generals considering a coup. On 23 August, the first contact with a U.S. representative was made by generals who had begun to plan a coup against Diem. They were told that the U.S. had determined that Diem's brother, who had led the raids on the Buddhists, could not stay in any kind of power, and that, \"then, we must face the possibility that Diem himself cannot be preserved.\"\n\n{{quote|A White House tape of President Kennedy and his advisers, published this week in a new book-and-CD collection and excerpted on the Web, confirms that top U.S. officials sought the 1 November 1963 coup against then-South Vietnamese leader Ngo Dinh Diem without apparently considering the physical consequences for Diem personally (he was murdered the following day). The taped meeting and related documents show that U.S. officials, including JFK, vastly overestimated their ability to control the South Vietnamese generals who ran the coup 40 years ago this week [November 2003].\n\nThe Kennedy tape from 29 October 1963 captures the highest-level White House meeting immediately prior to the coup, including the President's brother voicing doubts about the policy of support for a coup: \"I mean, it's different from a coup in the Iraq or South American country; we are so intimately involved in this ...<ref name=\"NSAEBB101\">{{citation\n | title = JFK and the Diem Coup\n | first = John |last = Prados\n | url = http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB101/index.htm\n | date = 3 November 2003\n | volume = George Washington University National Security Archive Electronic Briefing Book No. 101\n}}</ref>}}\n\nAn 8 May 1973 memorandum<ref name=\"NSAEBB222-1973-05-08\" /> states that \"An Inspector General report of  investigation of allegations that the Agency was instrumental in bringing about the assassination of [[President (government title)|President]] [[Ngo Dinh Diem]] of [[South Vietnam]]. The allegations were determined to be without foundation.\"\n\nNevertheless, the [[Pentagon Papers]] observed,\n\n<blockquote>For the military coup d'etat against Ngo Dinh Diem, the U.S. must accept its full share of responsibility. Beginning in August 1963 we variously authorized, sanctioned and encouraged the coup efforts of the Vietnamese generals and offered full support for a successor government. In October we cut off aid to Diem in a direct rebuff, giving a green light to the generals. We maintained clandestine contact with them throughout the planning and execution of the coup and sought to review their operational plans and proposed new government. Thus, as the nine-year rule of Diem came to a bloody end, our complicity in his overthrow heightened our responsibilities and our commitment in an essentially leaderless Vietnam.<ref name=\"PP2-4-201\" /></blockquote>\n\n====Mahdawi====\n{{Main|CIA activities in Iraq}}\nAccording to the [[Church Committee]] report:\n\n<blockquote>In February 1960, CIA's Near East Division sought the endorsement of what the Division Chief <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[James H.

In April [1962], the [Health Alteration] Committee unanimously recommended to the DDP [Deputy Director for Plans, [[Richard M.

The approved operation was to mail a monogrammed handkerchief containing an incapacitating agent to the colonel from an Asian country. [James] Scheider [Science Advisor to Bissell] testified that, while he did not now recall the name of the recipient, he did remember mailing from the Asian country, during the period in question, a handkerchief \"treated with some kind of material for the purpose of harassing that person who received it.\"&nbsp;... During the course of this Committee's investigation, the CIA stated that the handkerchief was \"in fact never received (if, indeed, sent).\" It added that the colonel: \"Suffered a terminal illness before a firing squad in Baghdad (an event we had nothing to do with) not very long after our handkerchief proposal was considered.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://history-matters.com/archive/church/reports/ir/html/ChurchIR_0098a.htm|title=Alleged Assassination Plots involving Foreign Leaders|author=United States Senate Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities|page=181|date=1975-11-20|accessdate=2016-02-01|author-link=Church Committee}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nAlthough some sources<ref>See, e.g., {{cite web|authorlink=David Wise (journalist)|last=Wise|first=David|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1991-04-14/opinion/op-141_1_bush-administration|title=A People Betrayed: Twice before, Washington let Kurds die to promote foreign-policy designs.

They did not review program implementation in recipient countries. They interviewed officials and obtained records from AID and the Departments of State, Justice, and Defense, in Washington, D.C.; reviewed legislation and agency legal opinions on foreign police assistance; interviewed academic and legal experts on current U.S. assistance to foreign police; and reviewed literature published on foreign police assistance and AID's public safety program.<ref name=\"GAO1992-03-05Scope\">{{citation\n | title = Foreign Aid: Police Training and Assistance; report to Congressional requesters\n | author = U.S. General Accounting Office, National Security and International Affairs Division\n | date=5 March 1992\n | chapter =SCOPE AND METHODOLOGY\n | chapter-url = https://fas.org/irp/gao/920300-train.htm}}</ref>\n\n===Legislative exemptions to the prohibition on U.S. assistance to foreign police===\nCongressionally approved exemptions generally authorize activities that benefit a specific U.S. goal, such as countering the terrorist threat to U.S. citizens overseas or combating drug trafficking.<ref name=\"GAO1992-03-05AppI\">{{citation\n | title = Foreign Aid: Police Training and Assistance; report to Congressional requesters\n | author = U.S. General Accounting Office, National Security and International Affairs Division\n | date=5 March 1992\n | chapter =Appendix I.

In 1988 the Congress further expanded the judicial reform program to allow police assistance to promote investigative and forensic skills, develop law enforcement training curricula, and improve administration and management of law enforcement organizations. This act specifically prohibited the Department of Defense (DOD) and the U.S. armed forces from providing training under this program.<ref name=\"ISD1985\" />\n\nMaritime subjects were exempted from the section 660 prohibition, as well as the prohibition for any country that has a long-standing democratic tradition, does not have armed forces, and does not engage in a consistent pattern of gross violations of human rights. The act permitted such countries to receive any type of police assistance.\n\n*International Narcotics Control Acts\nThis series of acts approved certain police assistance activities in [[Latin America]] and the Caribbean for narcotics control purposes. The 1988 act expanded DOD's role and allowed it to provide training and weapons and ammunition in fiscal years 1989 and 1990 to foreign police units that are specifically organized for narcotics enforcement in eligible countries in Latin America and the Caribbean. This act also allowed economic support funds to be provided to Colombian police for the protection of judges, government officials, and members of the press against narco-terrorist attacks. The 1989 Act extended DOD's authority to train police units in [[Bolivia]], [[Colombia]], and [[Peru]] in fiscal year 1990, if the units are only for narcotics enforcement.  It also allowed DOD to provide, in addition to weapons and ammunition, other defense articles such as helicopters, vehicles, radios, and personnel gear.\nThe 1990 act authorized DOD to continue to train and equip police forces in the [[Andes|Andean region]].<ref name=\"GAO1992-03-05IntNarc\"/>\n*Urgent Assistance for Democracy in Panama Act of 1990 \u2013 after the U.S. invasion of [[Panama]], the Congress significantly enhanced the U.S. role in the development of the new police force in Panama.

For example, the President may authorize foreign assistance when `it is important to the security interests of the United States'. This allows the President to waive any provision of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, including section 660.<ref>Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, 22 USC 2364</ref>\n\n===U.S. assistance provided to foreign police===\n\n====Antiterrorism assistance====\n\nThis aims to improve foreign governments' antiterrorist capabilities to better protect U.S. citizens and interests.<ref name=\"GAO1992-03-05App2AT\" /> In 1990, the U.S. provided assistance to 49 countries at a cost of nearly $10 million. Sixty-two percent of the funds were spent in Latin America, the Caribbean, and Europe, and less than $500,000 was used to purchase equipment. The Department of State manages the program and contracts with other U.S. government agencies, state or local police departments, and private firms to conduct the training. The [[Federal Aviation Administration]],<ref name=\"GAO1992-03-05App2AT\" /> U.S. [[Customs Service]], the [[Immigration and Naturalization Service]], the [[Federal Law Enforcement Training Center]], and the [[U.S. Marshals Service]] are regular trainers. In compliance with legislative requirements, most training takes place in the United States.\n\n====International narcotics control====\n\nOne of the objectives of the Department of State Bureau of International Narcotics Matters (INM) international narcotics control training program is to strengthen host country enforcement and interdiction capabilities.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} During fiscal year 1990, INM provided a minimum of $45 million in training and equipment to foreign police, principally in [[Mexico]], [[Jamaica]], [[Colombia]], [[Ecuador]], [[Peru]], [[Bolivia]], [[Brazil]], [[Venezuela]], [[Pakistan]], [[Thailand]], and [[Turkey]]. These are all narcotics producing and trafficking countries.\n\nINM reimburses other U.S. government agencies, primarily the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), Customs, and Coast Guard, to conduct the actual training. DEA provides narcotics investigative training, Customs teaches air, sea and land port search procedures, and [[Coast Guard]] teaches courses in maritime interdiction. Other agencies may also be requested to train on a reimbursable basis in areas where they have specific expertise. For example, DOD provides helicopter training to police in drug trafficking countries. Training is conducted both overseas and in the United States and is reviewed and approved by INM.<ref name=\"GAO1992-03-05IntNarc\">{{citation\n | title = Foreign Aid: Police Training and Assistance; report to Congressional requesters\n | author = U.S. General Accounting Office, National Security and International Affairs Division\n | date=5 March 1992\n | chapter = Appendix II. U.S. Assistance Provided to Foreign Police: INTERNATIONAL NARCOTICS CONTROL\n | chapter-url = https://fas.org/irp/gao/920300-train.htm}}</ref>\n\nIn addition, DOD used military assistance funds to train and equip narcotics enforcement police in several drug producing and trafficking countries. Documents provided by DOD show that in fiscal year 1990, DOD provided training and equipment with a value of at least $17 million to Mexico, $1.3 million to Bolivia, $10 million to Colombia, $1 million to Ecuador, and $1 million to Peru. DOD officials informed us that training and equipment valued at more than these amounts may also have been provided. However, documentation was not available at the Washington, D.C., agency headquarters level that specified the amounts for law enforcement activities. The equipment provided consisted of UH-1 helicopters and spare parts, ammunition, small arms, riot control equipment, radios, and miscellaneous personal gear.\n\n====Investigative and international police training====\nIn FY1986,  AID transferred funds to DOJ to design, develop, and implement projects to improve and enhance the investigative capabilities of law enforcement agencies in the Latin America and the Caribbean region. This was part of AID's effort to reform judicial systems. Using these funds, DOJ established the International Criminal Investigative Training Assistance Program (ICITAP).<ref name=\"GAO1992-03-05Train\">{{citation\n | title = Foreign Aid: Police Training and Assistance; report to Congressional requesters\n | author = U.S. General Accounting Office, National Security and International Affairs Division\n | date=5 March 1992\n | chapter =INVESTIGATIVE AND INTERNATIONAL POLICE TRAINING\n | chapter-url = https://fas.org/irp/gao/920300-train.htm}}</ref> Operating under State Department oversight, ICITAP has conducted criminal justice sector needs assessments in the region and has expanded its training to include basic police management and police academy development. In fiscal year 1990, ICITAP received $7 million from the Department of State for its regional program. It trained more than 1,000 students from the Caribbean, Central and South America and sponsored 7 conferences. Training includes police management, criminal investigation, crime scene search, and forensic medicine courses. Except for students sent to training programs in the United States, ICITAP training takes place overseas.\n\nThe [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) also provides limited training for foreign law enforcement officials.<ref name=\"GAO1992-03-05Train\" /> Each year approximately 100 international police officials attend the 11-week college level course at the FBI National Academy that includes studies on management and forensic sciences. The FBI pays for the training and subsistence, but does not pay for the students' transportation. Over the last 10 years, more than 1,100 foreign police officials from 89 countries have graduated from this course.\n\nUsing its own funds, the FBI created two training courses:\n*Training for Mexican police to better assist the United States in its investigations. Mexican officers receive a 3-day course in basic law enforcement techniques to include crime scene management, collection and preservation of evidence, hostage negotiations, forensic science, and investigative techniques. Since 1987, over 400 Mexican border police have been trained. FBI officials stated that the FBI plans to establish a training school in Mexico during 1992 at an estimated cost of about $250,000 annually, excluding salaries.\n*The second course developed by the FBI for foreign police was to provide mid-level management training for police officials from the Pacific Island nations. The 4-week course includes first-line supervision, investigative techniques, and hostage negotiations. During 1991, 52 students graduated from the course held in [[Guam]] at a cost to the FBI of about $35,000. About 50 students are expected to attend this course during the spring of 1992.\n\nThe FBI also provides other training and assistance to foreign police as requested, but the cost is unknown.<ref name=\"GAO1992-03-05Train\" /> For example, the [[National Center for the Analysis of Violent Crime]] provided training to [[Canada|Canadian]] police. The Criminal Investigative Division conducted a training seminar for officers from Italy's three national law enforcement agencies on the use of sensitive investigative techniques such as the operation of confidential sources, undercover operations, and electronic surveillance. The FBI also furnishes on-the-job assistance to governments who request help during particularly difficult or sensitive investigations.\n\n====Counterterrorism and military assistance====\nDOD supplies a limited amount of military training and assistance to police officials. During fiscal years 1986 and 1987, DOD trained and equipped the El Salvadoran and Honduran police to counter urban terrorist activities.<ref name=\"GAO1992-03-05Train\" /><ref name=\"GAO1992-03-05CTMA\">{{citation\n | title = Foreign Aid: Police Training and Assistance; report to Congressional requesters\n | author = U.S. General Accounting Office, National Security and International Affairs Division\n | date=5 March 1992\n | chapter =COUNTERTERRORISM AND MILITARY ASSISTANCE\n | chapter-url = https://fas.org/irp/gao/920300-train.htm}}</ref>\n\nThis assistance was authorized in response to the murder of U.S. Marines by terrorists in El Salvador and was managed and delivered by the U.S. Army Military Police. The assistance consisted of training in counterterrorism techniques and the supply of police vehicles, communications, weapons, and other equipment. This effort cost $19.8 million, of which $17 million was provided to El Salvador.\n\nIn fiscal year 1990, DOD spent $6.4 million in previously authorized but unused military assistance funds to purchase needed equipment and weapons for Panama's newly formed national police force. Items procured included police vehicles, communications equipment, small arms, and personal gear. This assistance was a one-time, emergency program.\n\nDOD has an ongoing military assistance program to support Costa Rican police. In fiscal year 1990, DOD supplied $431,000 in military equipment and $232,000 in military training to the Costa Rican Civil Guard to help them carry out their responsibility to protect the border regions of the country. DOD provided equipment such as vehicles, personnel gear, and radios, and military training in areas such as coastal operations. Additionally, DOD conducted technical training courses in equipment maintenance and medical skills among others.<ref name=\"GAO1992-03-05CTMA\" />\n\nDOD, along with the United Kingdom, supports the Eastern Caribbean Regional Security System<ref name=\"CIP\">{{citation \n | url = http://ciponline.org/facts/ecr03.htm\n | author = Center for International Policy\n | title = Eastern Caribbean Overview\n}}</ref>{{failed verification|date=July 2015}} that was formed after the U.S. intervention in [[Grenada]]. The Security System is composed of a few permanently assigned military officers, but largely depends upon island nation police officers who can be called up for military duty in case of emergency. The United States equips and trains these personnel to prepare them for such an eventually. In fiscal year 1990, DOD provided $4.2 million in military assistance funds that were used to purchase equipment such as jeeps, small arms, uniforms, and communications gear. DOD also provided $300,000 for training in special operations, rural patrol, field survival, and surveillance, as well as technical courses in communications, navigation, maintenance, and medicine.\n\n====Difficulties in determining cost and extent of assistance====\nSince some agencies fund assistance out of their own budgets, without necessarily having a line item for police assistance, the GAO \"could not accurately determine the extent or cost of assistance to foreign police\" In the GAO estimates, \"some double counting of students may be occurring and agencies may not be differentiating between assistance provided to police and assistance provided to the military.\" This might happen when \"the agency supplying the training and the agency paying for the training may both include the trainees in their reporting systems, such as when ICITAP pays for students attending the FBI academy.\"\n\nWhile the DOJ was asked to calculate information on its work with foreign police, it could not assign a dollar value to items including \"travel expenses, salaries, and expendable items such as course materials.\" H.<ref name=\"GAO1992-03-05PolAsst\">{{citation\n | title = Foreign Aid: Police Training and Assistance; report to Congressional requesters\n | author = U.S. General Accounting Office, National Security and International Affairs Division\n | date=5 March 1992\n | chapter = Appendix II. U.S. Assistance Provided to Foreign Police: DIFFICULTIES IN DETERMINING COST AND EXTENT OF ASSISTANCE\n | chapter-url = https://fas.org/irp/gao/920300-train.htm}}</ref> \n\"Also, GAO could not always determine whether a student was a police officer or a military member because some agencies do not collect such data, DOD officials informed us that once they receive permission to train police in a specific activity they do not provide a further accounting breakdown. For example, training provided to the Eastern Caribbean Regional Security System was for law enforcement personnel, although a few trainees may have belonged to military organizations.\"\n\n==Human experimentation==\n{{more citations needed section|date=March 2014}}\nProject [[MKULTRA]], or [[MK-ULTRA]], was the code name for a CIA mind-control research program that began in 1950, involved primarily with the experimentation of drugs and other \"chemical, biological and radiological\" stimuli on both willing and uninformed subjects.<ref>[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=471+U.S.+159&hl=en&as_sdt=2,33&case=16297847318525168348&scilh=0 CIA v. Sims], 471 U.S. 159, 161\u2013162 (1985)</ref>\n\n===Rockefeller Commission===\nIn December 1974, ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that the CIA had conducted illegal domestic activities, including experiments on U.S. citizens, during the 1960s. The report prompted investigations by both the U.S. Congress (in the form of the [[Church Committee]]) and a presidential commission (known as the [[United States President's Commission on CIA activities within the United States|Rockefeller Commission]]). The congressional investigations and the Rockefeller Commission report revealed that the CIA and the Department of Defense had in fact conducted experiments to influence and control human behavior through the use of psychoactive drugs such as [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]] and [[mescaline]] and other chemical, biological, and psychological means. Experiments were often conducted without the subjects' knowledge or consent.\n\nMK-ULTRA was started on the order of CIA director [[Allen Dulles]], largely in response to alleged Soviet, Chinese, and North Korean use of mind-control techniques on U.S. prisoners of war in Korea. The goal of the experiments was to study mind-control in order to develop methods of interrogation and behavior modification and manipulation, as well as to develop a possible [[truth drug]].\n\n===Outcome===\n[[MK-ULTRA]] research ultimately proved useless to the CIA and they have abandoned the program. Because most MK-ULTRA records were deliberately destroyed in 1973 by order of then CIA Director [[Richard Helms]], it is difficult if not impossible to have a complete understanding of the more than 150 individually funded research sub-projects sponsored by MK-ULTRA and related CIA programs.\n\nFollowing the recommendations of the [[Church Committee]], President Gerald Ford in 1976 issued the first [[Executive Order]] on Intelligence Activities which, among other things, prohibited \"experimentation with drugs on human subjects, except with the informed consent, in writing and witnessed by a disinterested party, of each such human subject\" and in accordance with the guidelines issued by the National Commission. Subsequent orders by Presidents Carter and [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]] expanded the directive to apply to any human experimentation.\n\n==Assassination and targeted killing==\n{{Main|Targeted killing}}\n:''See [[United States involvement in regime change]]\n\n===Targeted Killing===\n{{Main|Drone strike|Disposition Matrix}}\n{{Seealso|Civilian casualties from U.S. drone strikes}}\n[[File:Graph of Average Casualties in US Drone Strikes in Yemen 2002-present.png|thumb|270px|Graph of average casualties in drone strikes ordered by the United States in [[Yemen]], 2002-Present.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lb1hEYJ_omI8lSe33izwS2a2lbiygs0hTp2Al_Kz5KQ/edit#gid=1277572900|title=US strikes in Yemen, 2002 to present|work=Google Docs|language=en}}</ref>]]\nAt least since World War II, a distinction has been drawn between assassination of civilian leaders, and [[targeted killing]]s of leaders of fighting organizations. Some cases were blurry, such as the British-Czech [[Operation Anthropoid]], the killing of uniformed SS officer [[Reinhard Heydrich]], the acting [[Reichsprotektor]] of [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia|The Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]]. A failed attempt, by British troops, to kill [[Field Marshal]] [[Erwin Rommel]] was clearly aimed at a military leader, as was the successful shooting down of [[Admiral]] [[Death of Isoroku Yamamoto|Isoroku Yamamoto]].\n\nCIA has admitted being involved in assassination attempts against foreign leaders. Recently, there have been targeted killings of suspected terrorists, typically with missiles fired from [[unmanned aerial vehicles]], in a manner that a number of legal authorities believe was a legitimate act as opposed to a prohibited assassination.\n\n===Assassinations===\nOf the cases cited, it appears that no CIA personnel or even directly controlled foreign agents personally killed any leader, but there certainly were cases where the CIA knew of, or supported, plots to overthrow foreign leaders. In the cases of Lumumba in 1960/61 and Castro in the 50s and 60s, the CIA was involved in preparing to kill the individual. In other cases, such as Diem, the Agency knew of a plot but did not warn him, and communications at White House level indicated that the Agency had, with approval, told the plotters the US didn't object to their plan. The gun or poison, however, was not in the hands of a CIA officer.\n\nCIA personnel were involved in attempted assassinations of foreign government leaders such as [[Fidel Castro]]. They provided support to those that killed [[Patrice Lumumba]]. In yet another category was noninterference in the Republic of Vietnam (South Vietnam) ''[[Coup d'\u00e9tat]]'' in which President [[Ngo Dinh Diem]] was killed.\n\nA distinction has been drawn between political assassinations and [[CIA transnational anti-terrorism activities#Targeted killing in war versus assassination|\"targeted killing\" of leaders of non-state belligerents]].\n\n====Castro====\n{{main|Assassination attempts on Fidel Castro}}\n[[File:Sam Giancana.jpg|thumb|190px|The CIA recruited [[Sam Giancana]] (pictured), [[Santo Trafficante, Jr.|Santo Trafficante]] and other mobsters to assassinate Fidel Castro.<ref>{{cite news |last=Snow |first=Anita |date=June 27, 2007 |title=CIA Plot to Kill Castro Detailed|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/27/AR2007062700190.html |newspaper=The Washington Post |location=Washington, DC|agency=AP }}</ref>]]\nPerhaps the best-documented account of CIA-sponsored assassination plans were against [[President (government title)|President]] [[Fidel Castro]] of [[Cuba]].\n\nAccording to columnist Jack Anderson,<ref name=\"Anderson1971-06-18\">{{citation\n | journal = Washington Post\n | first = Jack | last = Anderson | authorlink = Jack Anderson (columnist)\n | date = 18 June 1971\n | page = B7\n | title = 6 Attempts to Kill Castro laid to CIA\n}}</ref> the first attempt was part of the [[Bay of Pigs Invasion]] operation, but five more teams were sent, the last apprehended on a rooftop within rifle range of Castro, at the end of February or beginning of March 1963.

The CIA assigned two operations officers, [[William King Harvey]] and James O'Connell, to accompany Roselli to Miami to recruit the actual teams.\n\nAnderson's story appears to be confirmed by two CIA documents, the first referring to an Inspector General report of investigation of allegations that the Agency conspired to assassinate Fidel Castro. The story first appeared in Drew Pearson's column and has since appeared in Jack Anderson's column. \"While the columns contained many factual errors, the allegations are basically true.<ref name=\"NSAEBB222-1973-05-08\">{{citation\n | url = http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB222/index.htm\n | volume = George Washington University National Security Archives Electronic Briefing Book No. 222, \"The CIA's Family Jewels\"\n | title = Memorandum for the Executive Secretary, CIA Management Committee.

The assassination attempts started under the presidency of [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] and continued under [[John F. Kennedy]] and [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]. Most attempts were made during [[Richard Nixon]]\u2019s presidency. When Castro travelled abroad, the CIA cooperated with Cuban exiles for some of the more serious assassination attempts. In 2000, when Castro was due to visit Panama, a plot was hatched to put explosives under the podium where he was due to speak. Castro\u2019s personal security team discovered the explosives before he arrived.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Campbell |first1=Duncan |title=Close but no cigar: how America failed to kill Fidel Castro |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/26/fidel-castro-cia-cigar-assasination-attempts |accessdate=3 January 2019 |publisher=The Guardian |date=26 November 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=MacAskill |first1=Ewen |title=The CIA has a long history of helping to kill leaders around the world |url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/may/05/cia-long-history-kill-leaders-around-the-world-north-korea |accessdate=3 January 2019 |publisher=The Guardian |date=5 May 2017}}</ref>\n\n====Diem====\nIn summary, CIA, Embassy, and other US personnel, up to White House level, were aware of yet another coup being planned against [[President (government title)|President]] [[Ngo Dinh Diem]] of [[South Vietnam]]. While the US had no direct participation in the coup, the plotters were told, in a deniable way, that the US did not object to it. No documentary evidence has surfaced that the US knew that Diem and his brother were to be killed, and it is unclear that all the Vietnamese plotters knew or agreed to it. [[President (government title)|President]] [[John F. Kennedy]] was aware of the coup plans, but apparently had not considered the hazard to Diem.\n\nAccording to the ''Pentagon Papers'', the final US loss of confidence in Diem began when his government violently suppressed a protest on Buddha's Birthday, 8 May 1963. Up to that point, the majority Buddhists had not been very politically active, even though Diem had given preference to the Catholic minority. Quickly, however, the Buddhists put a \"cohesive and disciplined [political] organization\" into action. By June, the situation moved from dissidence from a religious group to a \"grave crisis of public confidence\".<ref name=\"PP2-4-201\">{{citation\n | title = The Pentagon Papers, Gravel Edition, Volume 2\n | chapter = Chapter 4, \"The Overthrow of Ngo Dinh Diem, May\u2013November, 1963\" \n | pages = 201\u2013276\n | publisher = Beacon Press\n | year = 1971 \n | chapter-url = http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/pentagon2/pent6.htm}}</ref>\n\nThen-Ambassador [[Frederick Nolting]] had tried to persuade Diem to moderate government action against Buddhists, but with no success. While Nolting was on leave, [[President (government title)|President]] [[John F. Kennedy]] appointed [[Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr.]] as the new Ambassador. In June 1963, senior leaders began, for the first time, to discuss the effect of a coup to remove Diem. Nolting and the US military in Vietnam, however, argued that Diem was keeping chaos at bay. Nolting left permanently in mid-August, but the assurances from Diem died with multiple August 21 night raids on Buddhist temples in many parts of Vietnam. Two days later, a US representative was approached by generals considering a coup. On 23 August, the first contact with a U.S. representative was made by generals who had begun to plan a coup against Diem. They were told that the U.S. had determined that Diem's brother, who had led the raids on the Buddhists, could not stay in any kind of power, and that, \"then, we must face the possibility that Diem himself cannot be preserved.\"\n\n{{quote|A White House tape of President Kennedy and his advisers, published this week in a new book-and-CD collection and excerpted on the Web, confirms that top U.S. officials sought the 1 November 1963 coup against then-South Vietnamese leader Ngo Dinh Diem without apparently considering the physical consequences for Diem personally (he was murdered the following day). The taped meeting and related documents show that U.S. officials, including JFK, vastly overestimated their ability to control the South Vietnamese generals who ran the coup 40 years ago this week [November 2003].\n\nThe Kennedy tape from 29 October 1963 captures the highest-level White House meeting immediately prior to the coup, including the President's brother voicing doubts about the policy of support for a coup: \"I mean, it's different from a coup in the Iraq or South American country; we are so intimately involved in this ...<ref name=\"NSAEBB101\">{{citation\n | title = JFK and the Diem Coup\n | first = John |last = Prados\n | url = http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB101/index.htm\n | date = 3 November 2003\n | volume = George Washington University National Security Archive Electronic Briefing Book No. 101\n}}</ref>}}\n\nAn 8 May 1973 memorandum<ref name=\"NSAEBB222-1973-05-08\" /> states that \"An Inspector General report of  investigation of allegations that the Agency was instrumental in bringing about the assassination of [[President (government title)|President]] [[Ngo Dinh Diem]] of [[South Vietnam]]. The allegations were determined to be without foundation.\"\n\nNevertheless, the [[Pentagon Papers]] observed,\n\n<blockquote>For the military coup d'etat against Ngo Dinh Diem, the U.S. must accept its full share of responsibility. Beginning in August 1963 we variously authorized, sanctioned and encouraged the coup efforts of the Vietnamese generals and offered full support for a successor government. In October we cut off aid to Diem in a direct rebuff, giving a green light to the generals. We maintained clandestine contact with them throughout the planning and execution of the coup and sought to review their operational plans and proposed new government. Thus, as the nine-year rule of Diem came to a bloody end, our complicity in his overthrow heightened our responsibilities and our commitment in an essentially leaderless Vietnam.<ref name=\"PP2-4-201\" /></blockquote>\n\n====Mahdawi====\n{{Main|CIA activities in Iraq}}\nAccording to the [[Church Committee]] report:\n\n<blockquote>In February 1960, CIA's Near East Division sought the endorsement of what the Division Chief <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[James H. Critchfield]]<nowiki>]</nowiki> called the \"Health Alteration Committee\" for its proposal for a \"special operation\" to \"incapacitate\" an [[Iraq]]i Colonel believed to be \"promoting Soviet bloc political interests in Iraq.\" The Division sought the Committee's advice on a technique, \"which while not likely to result in total disablement would be certain to prevent the target from pursuing his usual activities for a minimum of three months,\" adding: \"We do not consciously seek subject's permanent removal from the scene; we also do not object should this complication develop.\"&nbsp;... In April [1962], the [Health Alteration] Committee unanimously recommended to the DDP [Deputy Director for Plans, [[Richard M. Bissell Jr.]]] that a \"disabling operation\"  be undertaken, noting that the Chief of Operations advised that it would be \"highly desirable.\" Bissell's deputy, [[Tracy Barnes]], approved on behalf of Bissell&nbsp;... The approved operation was to mail a monogrammed handkerchief containing an incapacitating agent to the colonel from an Asian country. [James] Scheider [Science Advisor to Bissell] testified that, while he did not now recall the name of the recipient, he did remember mailing from the Asian country, during the period in question, a handkerchief \"treated with some kind of material for the purpose of harassing that person who received it.\"&nbsp;... During the course of this Committee's investigation, the CIA stated that the handkerchief was \"in fact never received (if, indeed, sent).\" It added that the colonel: \"Suffered a terminal illness before a firing squad in Baghdad (an event we had nothing to do with) not very long after our handkerchief proposal was considered.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://history-matters.com/archive/church/reports/ir/html/ChurchIR_0098a.htm|title=Alleged Assassination Plots involving Foreign Leaders|author=United States Senate Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities|page=181|date=1975-11-20|accessdate=2016-02-01|author-link=Church Committee}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nAlthough some sources<ref>See, e.g., {{cite web|authorlink=David Wise (journalist)|last=Wise|first=David|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1991-04-14/opinion/op-141_1_bush-administration|title=A People Betrayed: Twice before, Washington let Kurds die to promote foreign-policy designs.
