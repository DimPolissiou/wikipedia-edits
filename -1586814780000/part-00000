She was introduced as one of the new [[player character]]s in the [[fighting game]] ''[[Mortal Kombat II]]'' in 1993. Since then, Kitana appeared in a majority of ''Mortal Kombat'' series' video games and its other media, including the films ''[[Mortal Kombat (1995 film)|Mortal Kombat]]'' and ''[[Mortal Kombat: Annihilation]]'', and the series ''[[Mortal Kombat: Defenders of the Realm]]'', ''[[Mortal Kombat: Konquest]]'', and ''[[Mortal Kombat: Legacy]]'', becoming one of the most popular and recognizable characters of the franchise.\n\nOne of the lead characters of the ''Mortal Kombat'' saga, Kitana is the princess of Outworld and the adopted daughter of the emperor, [[Shao Khan]]. She has a \u201ctwin\u201d sister [[Mileena]] and personal bodyguard and best friend [[Jade (Mortal Kombat)|Jade]] always at her side. Through the course of events in the series, she learns that she is actually the daughter of Queen [[Sindel]] and King Jerrod, the rulers of Edenia, a realm that was conquered and destroyed by Shao Khan. She discovers that Mileena is not actually her sister, but a clone created by the emperor\u2019s sorcerer [[Shang Tsung]] intended to watch over and spy on her. Kitana rebels and sides with the Earthrealm warriors to fight against Shao Khan and ultimately free her realm from being a part of Outworld.\n\nKitana has received positive critical reception for her role in the franchise, evolving from one of the three female ninja [[palette swap]]s to one of the main protagonists of the series.\n\n==Appearances==\n===In video games===\nKitana first appears in ''[[Mortal Kombat II]]'' (1993) as a member of the Edenian race in the fictional other dimension called Outworld.

Shinnok's forces are eventually defeated by the joint efforts of Kitana and her allies. With Edenia freed once again, Kitana proposes to Liu Kang, offering him the chance to rule Edenia at her side as King and Queen, but he reluctantly rejects her offer, seeing his true duty as champion of Earth. After Shinnok's defeat, Kitana captures Mileena but learns that Shao Kahn has survived his defeat in Earthrealm and is regaining power. Knowing that Kahn would attempt to reclaim Edenia once he was strong enough, she forges an alliance with [[Goro (Mortal Kombat)|Goro]], prince of the Outworld race Shokan, against Kahn's forces.\n\nIn ''[[Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance]] (2002)'', Kitana, leading a preemptive strike against Shao Kahn's forces,<ref>''Mortal Kombat Deadly Alliance'' GameCube manual, page 22.</ref> learns that he has been slain by unknown assassins.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mortalkombatwarehouse.com/mkda/kitana/ |title=Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance: Kitana |publisher=Mortal Kombat Warehouse |date= |accessdate=2012-01-10}}</ref> Thinking her fight is at an end, she begins the journey back to Edenia, hoping to finally live in peace. However, on the way she encounters Kung Lao, who tells her of the plans of the Deadly Alliance of Quan Chi and Shang Tsung, who are responsible for Liu Kang and Shao Kahn's demise and are attempting to revive the undead army of the legendary Onaga the Dragon King. Despite Kitana's grief, she rejoins the Earthrealm warriors and leads them into battle. During the assault on Shang Tsung's palace, she faces Quan Chi one-on-one but despite her improved fighting skills, gained from training with [[Bo' Rai Cho]], Kitana is outmatched and killed alongside her allies.

Sindel is freed from her own dungeon by Jade, and together they flee to Outworld where they attempt to find a way to defeat Onaga and free Kitana from his influence.

Weary of constant battle, Kitana is disheartened, but Blaze assures her that the wars will soon be over. Following this warning, Kitana returns in ''[[Mortal Kombat: Armageddon]]'' (2006), accompanied by Liu Kang's spirit in order to keep him whole until there was a way to reunite him with his body. They later meet with [[Nightwolf]], who offers to relieve Kitana of her burden to take Liu Kang's soul into himself, allowing her to fight against the coming evil. Kitana ultimately perishes with the rest of her allies during the battle.\n\nIn the uncanonical crossover game ''[[Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe]]'' (2008), Kitana is transported to [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]], where she encounters her counterpart from the [[DC Universe]], [[Wonder Woman]].

Kitana battles Liu Kang in an attempt to ensure that he will not reach the final stages of the first tournament, but is defeated; expecting to die, she is surprised by his decision to spare her. Later, during the second tournament, Kitana is approached by Raiden, who informs her that her supposed past as Shao Kahn's daughter is a lie. Plagued bu doubts, she infiltrates Shang Tsung's flesh pits and discovers the newly-created Mileena. Before Kahn, she accuses Shang Tsung of attempting to replace her, and is shocked to learn that the Emperor himself ordered Mileena's creation. He then imprisons Kitana in the palace, prior to execution, and commands his \"true daughter\" to be brought to him. Kitana is soon freed by Liu Kang, and she and Jade escape to Earthrealm to join their new allies against the forces of Outworld. They assist in the battle for Earthrealm, but are killed alongside several others by Kitana's corrupted mother, Sindel. In the end, she is shown to be one of the warriors that are resurrected by Quan Chi in the Netherrealm to battle Raiden.\n\nIn both timelines, Kitana is killed and becomes some form of a revenant - one timeline she serves Onaga and is freed by the spirit of Liu Kang, while in the other timeline she serves Quan Chi until Raiden dethrones Shinnok, and Quan Chi is killed by Hanzo Hasashi (Scorpion), leaving the Netherealm to be ruled by both her and the revenant Liu Kang.\n\nKitana returns in ''[[Mortal Kombat X]]'' (2015).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.cheatcc.com/395954|title=New Mortal Kombat X Trailer Shows Off Kitana - Cheat Code Central|publisher=News.cheatcc.com|accessdate=17 January 2015}}</ref> In the story mode she is one of Quan Chi's revenants. She fights [[Jax (Mortal Kombat)|Jax]] and [[Cassie Cage]] in the game's story mode, and after Quan Chi's death and Shinnok's defeat, she and fellow revenant Liu Kang become the new rulers of the Netherrealm.\n\nKitana returns in ''[[Mortal Kombat 11]]'' (2019), as both her revenant and her still-living past self. Immediately after Kung Lao defeated Quan Chi and Shang Tsung in the second tournament, Kronika's time anomaly brought Kitana and most of her allies and enemies into the future. She and Jade remain in Outworld with Kotal Kahn to find and defeat the time-displaced Shao Kahn, while Raiden, Kung Lao and Liu Kang return to Earthrealm to learn more about their future selves, as well as the events that transpired in this timeline. To aid Kotal, Kitana attempts to forge an alliance with Sheeva and her Shokan army, but Sheeva will not commit unless the Tarkatans also join. After learning a news from Kung Lao and Liu Kang of Jade and Kotal\u2019s capture by Shao Kahn, Kitana and her Shaolin allied rescue Jade, and at the same time make peace with the time-displaced Baraka and his Tarkatans, who join her ranks. Later, Kitana and her new army rescue Kotal from being executed, with the princess defeating and blinded Shao Kahn personally, rendered the tyrant powerless without his sight. Kotal, now crippled from his battle with Shao Kahn, steps down as the Kahn of Outworld, appoints Kitana as a new worthy Kahn, due to her greater charisma for uniting all of Outworld's denizens with respect than Kotal ever was. After Liu Kang is kidnapped by Kronika, Kitana and her Outworld army aid Earthrealm's allied force of Special Forces and Shaolin against Kronika's army, until Raiden merges with both iterations of Liu Kang into Fire God Liu Kang. As the rest of her allies fight off Kronika's remaining army, Kitana and Kung Lao manage to reach Kronika's Time Keep with Liu Kang. However, Kitana and her allies are affected by Kronika's time-reverse, leaving Liu Kang to fight Kronika and Cetrion alone.

She first appears during the 1994 three-issue miniseries ''Goro: Prince of Pain'', joining Mileena, Baraka and [[Reptile (Mortal Kombat)|Reptile]] in searching for Goro in Outworld. During the ''Battlewave'' miniseries, she attempts to rebel against Kahn with the assistance of Kung Lao, Baraka and Sub-Zero. Kitana's enemies besides Mileena include Scorpion, who offers to take her as his new wife. She is the subject of a one-shot issue titled ''Kitana and Mileena: Sister Act'', in which her royal background from the games is intact, only she is already an adult when Shao Kahn kills Jerrod and seizes the realm, before putting her under a spell that makes her forget her past life and instead believe she is Kahn's daughter. Unlike in the game series' continuity, in the comic series Kitana has no interactions with neither Liu Kang nor Jade; instead, she has a closer relation with Kung Lao (Shang Tsung even attempts to exploit this while taking Kitana's form).<ref>''Mortal Kombat: Kung Lao #1: \"Rising Son\"'' (p.10-12).</ref> In [[Mortal Kombat (comics)|the official comics]], Kitana has a small part in Midway's ''Mortal Kombat 4'' prologue comic book published in 1997 and released with the PC version of the game, in which she arranges peace between the warring Shokan and Centaurian races, and appears in the 2008 tie-in comic ''Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe: Beginnings'', illustrated John Tobias and published by [[DC Comics]] in 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicvine.com/mortal-kombat-vs-dc-universe-beginnings/37-150618/|title=Mortal Kombat VS DC Universe #1 - Beginnings (comic book issue)|date=2008-11-01|publisher=Comicvine.com|accessdate=2013-11-06}}</ref>[[File:Movie Kitana.png|thumb|upright|[[Talisa Soto]] as Kitana in the 1995 film ''[[Mortal Kombat (1995 film)|Mortal Kombat]]''.

In the movies, Kitana was portrayed by [[Talisa Soto]] (who was one of the only two actors, along with [[Robin Shou]], to play the same character in both films), who was unmasked and wore less revealing, all-black costumes. In the 1995 [[Mortal Kombat (1995 film)|first film]], Kitana is introduced as a companion of Shang Tsung, who is aware that she is a dangerous adversary due to her being the rightful heir of Outworld and may attempt to ally herself with the Earth fighters, and he therefore sends Reptile to spy on Kitana.

Sean Catherine Derek's Writer Guide document for the show, as well as the official character guide,<ref>http://wskel.com/MK/mk_dotr_1996/show_guide/kombatants/booklet.pdf</ref> describe Kitana as an \"exotic\", \"gorgeous and outrageously sexy\" woman, who is \"extremely mysterious\" as she \"often speaks in mystical riddles.\" The guides also note \"a strong bond and major heat\" between her and Liu Kang, and that \"though she is incredibly feminine, Kitana is a fierce warrior.\" In the episode \"Skin Deep\", [[Rain (Mortal Kombat)|Rain]] is introduced as her former love interest turned enemy, though neither have ever shared any relationship in the series canon other than their Edenian heritage. In the episode \"Swords of Ilkan\", Kitana defeats her former ally named Zara, an original character. The episode \"Abandoned\" features a ninja girl named Ruby, a friend of Kitana (a reworking of Jade). The final episode \"Overthrown\" involves Kitana leading an unsuccessful rebellion against Shao Kahn's Outworld rule.\n\nKitana is a recurring character in the 1998 live-action television series ''[[Mortal Kombat: Conquest]]'', played by [[Audie England]] in two episodes (\"Vengeance\" and \"Shadow of a Doubt\") and once by Dara Tomanovich (\"The Essence\"), with Christine Rodriguez serving as their stunt double.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mortalkombat.com/film-conquestcredits.shtml|title=Full Cast and Crew for \"Mortal Kombat: Conquest\" (1998)|author=Manna Studio|date=2010-12-20|publisher=Web.archive.org|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101220232155/http://mortalkombat.com/film-conquestcredits.shtml|archivedate=2010-12-20|accessdate=2013-11-06}}</ref> In this series, she is fully aware of her Edenian past and the deaths of her parents at Kahn's hands, clandestinely working with [[Kung Lao]] to prevent the Emperor from conquering realms while at the same time feigning her allegiance to him. Her outfit and weapon are resembling these she has in the films, but she uses her native Edenian fighting style which she had mastered already before Shao Kahn's invasion and which was supplemented with various moves that she learnt from prisoners of her stepfather. The ''Konquest'' version of Mileena is neither her clone nor a sister but just someone who impersonates her to seduce and assassinate Kung Lao, and Rain appears as Kitana's former best friend. In the series finale, which ended in a cliffhanger due to the show's abrupt cancellation after two seasons, Kitana appears to die after she is reluctantly ordered by Shao Kahn to be killed for plotting against him.

She was introduced as one of the new [[player character]]s in the [[fighting game]] ''[[Mortal Kombat II]]'' in 1993. Since then, Kitana appeared in a majority of ''Mortal Kombat'' series' video games and its other media, including the films ''[[Mortal Kombat (1995 film)|Mortal Kombat]]'' and ''[[Mortal Kombat: Annihilation]]'', and the series ''[[Mortal Kombat: Defenders of the Realm]]'', ''[[Mortal Kombat: Konquest]]'', and ''[[Mortal Kombat: Legacy]]'', becoming one of the most popular and recognizable characters of the franchise.\n\nOne of the lead characters of the ''Mortal Kombat'' saga, Kitana is the princess of Outworld and the adopted daughter of the emperor, [[Shao Khan]]. She has a \u201ctwin\u201d sister [[Mileena]] and personal bodyguard and best friend [[Jade (Mortal Kombat)|Jade]] always at her side. Through the course of events in the series, she learns that she is actually the daughter of Queen [[Sindel]] and King Jerrod, the rulers of Edenia, a realm that was conquered and destroyed by Shao Khan. She discovers that Mileena is not actually her sister, but a clone created by the emperor\u2019s sorcerer [[Shang Tsung]] intended to watch over and spy on her. Kitana rebels and sides with the Earthrealm warriors to fight against Shao Khan and ultimately free her realm from being a part of Outworld.\n\nKitana has received positive critical reception for her role in the franchise, evolving from one of the three female ninja [[palette swap]]s to one of the main protagonists of the series.\n\n==Appearances==\n===In video games===\nKitana first appears in ''[[Mortal Kombat II]]'' (1993) as a member of the Edenian race in the fictional other dimension called Outworld.

However, on the way she encounters Kung Lao, who tells her of the plans of the Deadly Alliance of Quan Chi and Shang Tsung, who are responsible for Liu Kang and Shao Kahn's demise and are attempting to revive the undead army of the legendary Onaga the Dragon King. Despite Kitana's grief, she rejoins the Earthrealm warriors and leads them into battle. During the assault on Shang Tsung's palace, she faces Quan Chi one-on-one but despite her improved fighting skills, gained from training with [[Bo' Rai Cho]], Kitana is outmatched and killed alongside her allies.

Weary of constant battle, Kitana is disheartened, but Blaze assures her that the wars will soon be over. Following this warning, Kitana returns in ''[[Mortal Kombat: Armageddon]]'' (2006), accompanied by Liu Kang's spirit in order to keep him whole until there was a way to reunite him with his body. They later meet with [[Nightwolf]], who offers to relieve Kitana of her burden to take Liu Kang's soul into himself, allowing her to fight against the coming evil.

Kitana battles Liu Kang in an attempt to ensure that he will not reach the final stages of the first tournament, but is defeated; expecting to die, she is surprised by his decision to spare her. Later, during the second tournament, Kitana is approached by Raiden, who informs her that her supposed past as Shao Kahn's daughter is a lie. Plagued bu doubts, she infiltrates Shang Tsung's flesh pits and discovers the newly-created Mileena. Before Kahn, she accuses Shang Tsung of attempting to replace her, and is shocked to learn that the Emperor himself ordered Mileena's creation. He then imprisons Kitana in the palace, prior to execution, and commands his \"true daughter\" to be brought to him. Kitana is soon freed by Liu Kang, and she and Jade escape to Earthrealm to join their new allies against the forces of Outworld. They assist in the battle for Earthrealm, but are killed alongside several others by Kitana's corrupted mother, Sindel. In the end, she is shown to be one of the warriors that are resurrected by Quan Chi in the Netherrealm to battle Raiden.\n\nIn both timelines, Kitana is killed and becomes some form of a revenant - one timeline she serves Onaga and is freed by the spirit of Liu Kang, while in the other timeline she serves Quan Chi until Raiden dethrones Shinnok, and Quan Chi is killed by Hanzo Hasashi (Scorpion), leaving the Netherealm to be ruled by both her and the revenant Liu Kang.\n\nKitana returns in ''[[Mortal Kombat X]]'' (2015).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.cheatcc.com/395954|title=New Mortal Kombat X Trailer Shows Off Kitana - Cheat Code Central|publisher=News.cheatcc.com|accessdate=17 January 2015}}</ref> In the story mode she is one of Quan Chi's revenants. She fights [[Jax (Mortal Kombat)|Jax]] and [[Cassie Cage]] in the game's story mode, and after Quan Chi's death and Shinnok's defeat, she and fellow revenant Liu Kang become the new rulers of the Netherrealm.\n\nKitana returns in ''[[Mortal Kombat 11]]'' (2019), as both her revenant and her still-living past self. Immediately after Kung Lao defeated Quan Chi and Shang Tsung in the second tournament, Kronika's time anomaly brought Kitana and most of her allies and enemies into the future. She and Jade remain in Outworld with Kotal Kahn to find and defeat the time-displaced Shao Kahn, while Raiden, Kung Lao and Liu Kang return to Earthrealm to learn more about their future selves, as well as the events that transpired in this timeline. To aid Kotal, Kitana attempts to forge an alliance with Sheeva and her Shokan army, but Sheeva will not commit unless the Tarkatans also join. After learning a news from Kung Lao and Liu Kang of Jade and Kotal\u2019s capture by Shao Kahn, Kitana and her Shaolin allied rescue Jade, and at the same time make peace with the time-displaced Baraka and his Tarkatans, who join her ranks. Later, Kitana and her new army rescue Kotal from being executed, with the princess defeating and blinded Shao Kahn personally, rendered the tyrant powerless without his sight. Kotal, now crippled from his battle with Shao Kahn, steps down as the Kahn of Outworld, appoints Kitana as a new worthy Kahn, due to her greater charisma for uniting all of Outworld's denizens with respect than Kotal ever was. After Liu Kang is kidnapped by Kronika, Kitana and her Outworld army aid Earthrealm's allied force of Special Forces and Shaolin against Kronika's army, until Raiden merges with both iterations of Liu Kang into Fire God Liu Kang. As the rest of her allies fight off Kronika's remaining army, Kitana and Kung Lao manage to reach Kronika's Time Keep with Liu Kang. However, Kitana and her allies are affected by Kronika's time-reverse, leaving Liu Kang to fight Kronika and Cetrion alone. In one of the game's endings, the true ending, Kitana becomes Liu Kang's partner to forge a new timeline. Before reshaping the universe with Liu Kang, Kitana tells him that whatever they do, evil will rise someday, and that mortals will still make choices they cannot foresee. Liu Kang replies that each realm must choose its own destiny, and that whatever happens, they will face those events together.\n\n====Design history and derived characters====\n[[File:Kitana Tobias.jpg|thumb|left|A comparison of [[John Tobias]]' sketch of the unused character \"Kitsune\" in then original ''[[Mortal Kombat (1992 video game)|Mortal Kombat]]'' (1992) and his concept art for Kitana in ''[[Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3]]'']]\n\nIn 2009, Kitana's origins were revealed by her creator, [[John Tobias]], who disclosed that she started out as an unplayable [[herald]]-type character called \"Kitsune\" during the early development of the original ''[[Mortal Kombat (1992 video game)|Mortal Kombat]]'' game in 1991; his inspiration at the time was the character of Princess Mariko from [[Jordan Mechner]]'s 1984 video game ''[[Karateka (video game)|Karateka]]''.{{#tag:ref|Jordan Mechner commented: \"Ha thanks, that's awesome!

During the ''Battlewave'' miniseries, she attempts to rebel against Kahn with the assistance of Kung Lao, Baraka and Sub-Zero. Kitana's enemies besides Mileena include Scorpion, who offers to take her as his new wife. She is the subject of a one-shot issue titled ''Kitana and Mileena: Sister Act'', in which her royal background from the games is intact, only she is already an adult when Shao Kahn kills Jerrod and seizes the realm, before putting her under a spell that makes her forget her past life and instead believe she is Kahn's daughter. Unlike in the game series' continuity, in the comic series Kitana has no interactions with neither Liu Kang nor Jade; instead, she has a closer relation with Kung Lao (Shang Tsung even attempts to exploit this while taking Kitana's form).<ref>''Mortal Kombat: Kung Lao #1: \"Rising Son\"'' (p.10-12).</ref> In [[Mortal Kombat (comics)|the official comics]], Kitana has a small part in Midway's ''Mortal Kombat 4'' prologue comic book published in 1997 and released with the PC version of the game, in which she arranges peace between the warring Shokan and Centaurian races, and appears in the 2008 tie-in comic ''Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe: Beginnings'', illustrated John Tobias and published by [[DC Comics]] in 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicvine.com/mortal-kombat-vs-dc-universe-beginnings/37-150618/|title=Mortal Kombat VS DC Universe #1 - Beginnings (comic book issue)|date=2008-11-01|publisher=Comicvine.com|accessdate=2013-11-06}}</ref>[[File:Movie Kitana.png|thumb|upright|[[Talisa Soto]] as Kitana in the 1995 film ''[[Mortal Kombat (1995 film)|Mortal Kombat]]''.

In the 1995 [[Mortal Kombat (1995 film)|first film]], Kitana is introduced as a companion of Shang Tsung, who is aware that she is a dangerous adversary due to her being the rightful heir of Outworld and may attempt to ally herself with the Earth fighters, and he therefore sends Reptile to spy on Kitana.

In the episode \"Swords of Ilkan\", Kitana defeats her former ally named Zara, an original character. The episode \"Abandoned\" features a ninja girl named Ruby, a friend of Kitana (a reworking of Jade).

Her outfit and weapon are resembling these she has in the films, but she uses her native Edenian fighting style which she had mastered already before Shao Kahn's invasion and which was supplemented with various moves that she learnt from prisoners of her stepfather. The ''Konquest'' version of Mileena is neither her clone nor a sister but just someone who impersonates her to seduce and assassinate Kung Lao, and Rain appears as Kitana's former best friend. In the series finale, which ended in a cliffhanger due to the show's abrupt cancellation after two seasons, Kitana appears to die after she is reluctantly ordered by Shao Kahn to be killed for plotting against him.

Later, he was called to the principal's office, where the principal gave him a prepared speech to present in place of his own.

He also tried to entice Richard with an opportunity to become a teacher. Determined not to be called an [[Uncle Tom]], Richard refused to deliver the principal's address, written to avoid offending the white school district officials. The principal put pressure on one of Richard's uncles to speak to the boy and get him to change his mind, but Richard continued to be adamant about presenting his own speech, and refused to let his uncle edit it. Despite pressure even from his classmates, Richard delivered his speech as he had planned.\n\nIn September that year, Wright registered for mathematics, English, and history courses at the new [[Lanier High School (Jackson, Mississippi)|Lanier High School]], constructed for black students in Jackson\u2014the state's schools were segregated under its Jim Crow laws\u2014but he had to stop attending classes after a few weeks of irregular attendance because he needed to earn money for family expenses.<ref name=\"Rayson3\">Rayson, Ann. \"Richard Wright's Life.\" [http://www.english.illinois.edu/maps/poets/s_z/r_wright/wright_life.htm Modern American Poetry].

After securing employment as a United States postal clerk, during his time off, he read other writers and studied their styles. When he was fired from the post office during the [[Great Depression]], Wright was forced to go [[Federal Emergency Relief Administration|on relief]] in 1931. In 1932, he began attending meetings of the [[John Reed Club]]. As the club was dominated by the [[Communist Party USA|Communist Party]], Wright established a relationship with several party members. Especially interested in the literary contacts made at the meetings, Wright formally joined the Communist Party in late 1933. As a revolutionary poet, he wrote numerous proletarian poems (\"We of the Red Leaves of Red Books\", for example), for ''[[The New Masses]]'' and other [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] periodicals. A power struggle within the Chicago chapter of the John Reed Club had led to the dissolution of the club's leadership; Wright was told he had the support of the club's party members if he was willing to join the party.<ref>{{Cite book|last= Wright |first= Richard |authorlink= |editor= Crossman, Richard |title= The God That Failed |year= 1965 |publisher= [[Bantam Books]] |location= New York |language= |pages= 109\u201310 |chapter= Richard Wright |quote= |ref= }}</ref>\n\nBy 1935, Wright had completed the manuscript of his first novel, ''Cesspool'', which was published posthumously as ''Lawd Today'' (1963). In January 1936 his story \"Big Boy Leaves Home\" was accepted for publication in ''New Caravan.'' In February of that year, he began working with the [[National Negro Congress]]. In April he chaired the [[South Side Writers Group]], whose members included [[Arna Bontemps]] and [[Margaret Walker]]. Wright submitted some of his critical essays and poetry to the group for criticism and read aloud some of his short stories. Through the club, he edited ''Left Front,'' a magazine that the Communist Party shut down in 1937, despite Wright's repeated protests.<ref>{{Cite book|last= Wright |authorlink= |editor= Crossman |title= The God That Failed |year= 1965 |pages= 121 |chapter= Richard Wright |quote= |ref= }}</ref> Throughout this period, Wright continued to contribute to ''The New Masses'' magazine.\n\nPleased by his positive relations with white Communists in Chicago, Wright was later humiliated in New York City by some white party members who rescinded an offer to find housing for him when they learned his race.<ref>{{Cite book|last= Wright |authorlink= |editor= Crossman |title= The God That Failed |year= 1965 |pages= 123\u201326 |chapter= Richard Wright |quote= |ref= }}</ref>  Some black Communists denounced Wright as a \"[[bourgeois]] intellectual.\"  Wright was essentially [[Autodidacticism|autodidactic]].

He had developed a working relationship with a [[black nationalist]] communist, which, along with his dissatisfaction with the attitudes of and restrictions imposed by those in the party, led to a public falling out with the party and a number of its leading members. Wright later described this episode through his fictional character Buddy Nealson, [[The Communist Party and African-Americans|an African-American communist]] in his essay \"I tried to be a Communist\", published in the ''Atlantic Monthly'' in 1944. This text was an excerpt of his autobiography scheduled to be published as ''American Hunger'', but removed from the actual publication of ''[[Black Boy]]'' upon request by the [[Book of the Month Club]].<ref>{{Cite book|last= Wright |authorlink= |editor= Crossman|title= The God That Failed |year= 1960 |pages= 126\u201334 |chapter= Richard Wright |quote= |ref= }}.

He worked on the [[Federal Writers' Project]] guidebook to the city, ''New York Panorama'' (1938), and wrote the book's essay on [[Harlem]]. Wright became the Harlem editor of the ''[[Daily Worker]],'' a Communist newspaper. Through the summer and fall he wrote more than 200 articles for the ''Daily Worker'' and helped edit a short-lived literary magazine ''New Challenge.'' The year was also a landmark for Wright because he met and developed a friendship with writer [[Ralph Ellison]] that would last for years. He was awarded the ''[[Story (magazine)|Story]]'' magazine first prize of $500 for his short story \"Fire and Cloud\".<ref name=\"story\" />\n\nAfter receiving the ''Story'' prize in early 1938, Wright shelved his manuscript of ''Lawd Today'' and dismissed his literary agent, John Troustine. He hired Paul Reynolds, the well-known agent of poet [[Paul Laurence Dunbar]], to represent him. Meanwhile, the Story Press offered the publisher [[Harper & Row|Harper]] all of Wright's prize-entry stories for a book, and Harper agreed to publish the collection.\n\nWright gained national attention for the collection of four short stories entitled ''[[Uncle Tom's Children]]'' (1938). He based some stories on [[Lynching in the United States|lynching]] in the [[Deep South]]. The publication and favorable reception of ''Uncle Tom's Children'' improved Wright's status with the Communist party and enabled him to establish a reasonable degree of financial stability. He was appointed to the editorial board of ''New Masses.'' [[Granville Hicks]], a prominent literary critic and Communist sympathizer, introduced him at leftist teas in Boston. By May 6, 1938, excellent sales had provided Wright with enough money to move to Harlem, where he began writing the novel ''[[Native Son]],'' which he published in 1940.\n\nBased on his collected short stories, Wright applied for and was awarded a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]], which gave him a stipend allowing him to complete ''Native Son.'' During this period, he rented a room in the home of friends Herbert and Jane Newton, an interracial couple and prominent [[Communists]] whom Wright had known in Chicago.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=T6-lhNKL3ncC&pg=PT147&dq=Herbert%20and%20jane%20Newton#v=onepage&q=Herbert%20and%20jane%20Newton&f=false|title=Literary Brooklyn: The Writers of Brooklyn and the Story of American City Life|first=Evan|last=Hughes|date=August 16, 2011|publisher=Macmillan|accessdate=September 30, 2016|via=Google Books|isbn=9781429973069}}</ref> They had moved to New York and lived at 109 Lefferts Place in [[Brooklyn]] in the [[Fort Greene Historic District|Fort Greene]] neighborhood.<ref>Oleksinski, Johnny.

It was a daring choice. The lead character, Bigger Thomas, was a person bound by the limitations that society placed on African Americans. He gained his own [[Agency (philosophy)|agency]] and self-knowledge only by committing heinous acts.\n\nWright was criticized for his concentration on violence in his works. In the case of ''Native Son,'' people complained that he portrayed a black man in ways that seemed to confirm whites' worst fears. The period following publication of ''Native Son'' was a busy time for Wright. In July 1940 he went to Chicago to do research for a folk history of blacks to accompany photographs selected by [[Edwin Rosskam]]. While in Chicago he visited the ''American Negro Exhibition'' with [[Langston Hughes]], [[Arna Bontemps]] and [[Claude McKay]].\n[[File:Canada-Lee-Native-Son-1941.jpg|thumb|[[Canada Lee]] as Bigger Thomas in the [[Orson Welles]] production of ''[[Native Son (play)|Native Son]]'' (1941)]]\nHe traveled to [[Chapel Hill, North Carolina]], to collaborate with playwright [[Paul Green (playwright)|Paul Green]] on a dramatic adaptation of ''Native Son.'' In January 1941 Wright received the prestigious [[Spingarn Medal]] of the [[NAACP]] for noteworthy achievement. His play ''[[Native Son (play)|Native Son]]'' opened on Broadway in March 1941, with [[Orson Welles]] as director, to generally favorable reviews. Wright also wrote the text to accompany a volume of photographs chosen by Rosskam, which were almost completely drawn from the files of the [[Farm Security Administration]]. The FSA had employed top photographers to travel around the country and capture images of Americans. Their collaboration, ''Twelve Million Black Voices: A Folk History of the Negro in the United States,'' was published in October 1941 to wide critical acclaim.\n\nWright's memoir ''[[Black Boy]]'' (1945) described his early life from [[Roxie, Mississippi|Roxie]] up until his move to Chicago at age 19. It included his clashes with [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventist]] family, his troubles with white employers, and social isolation. It also describes his intellectual journey through these struggles. ''American Hunger'', which was published posthumously in 1977, was originally intended by Wright as the second volume of ''Black Boy.'' The [[Library of America]] edition of 1991 finally restored the book to its original two-volume form.\n\n''American Hunger'' detailed Wright's participation in the John Reed Clubs and the Communist Party, which he left in 1942. The book implied he left earlier, but he did not announce his withdrawal until 1944.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} In the book's restored form, Wright used the [[diptych]] structure to compare the certainties and intolerance of organized communism, which condemned \"bourgeois\" books and certain members, with similar restrictive qualities of fundamentalist organized religion. Wright disapproved of [[Joseph Stalin]]'s [[Great Purge]] in the [[Soviet Union]], but he continued to believe in far-left democratic solutions to political problems.\n\n===France===\n[[File:Plaque Richard Wright, 14 rue Monsieur-le-Prince, Paris 6.jpg|350px|thumbnail|Plaque commemorating Wright's residence in Paris, at 14, rue Monsieur le Prince.]]\n\nFollowing a stay of a few months in [[Qu\u00e9bec, Canada]], including a lengthy stay in the village of Sainte-P\u00e9tronille on the [[\u00cele d'Orl\u00e9ans]],<ref>Jean-Christophe Cloutier, Introduction to ''Jack Kerouac, La vie est d'hommage'' (Bor\u00e9al, 2016), pp. 31\u201332.</ref> Wright moved to Paris in 1946.

''The Unfinished Quest of Richard Wright.'' pp. 374</ref> In following Fabre's argument, with respect to Wright's existentialist proclivities during the period of 1946 to 1951, Hue Woodson suggests that Wright's exposure to Husserl and Heidegger \"directly came as an intended consequence of the inadequacies of Sartre's synthesis of [[existentialism]] and [[Marxism]] for Wright.\"<ref>Woodson, Hue (2019). \"Heidegger and ''The Outsider,'' ''Savage Holiday,'' and ''The Long Dream''\" in ''Critical Insights: Richard Wright,'' Ed. Kimberly Drake. p. 62</ref>  His [[Existentialist]] phase was expressed in his second novel, ''[[The Outsider (Richard Wright)|The Outsider]]'' (1953), which described an African-American character's involvement with the Communist Party in New York. He also became friends with fellow expatriate writers [[Chester Himes]] and [[James Baldwin]]. His relationship with the latter ended in acrimony after Baldwin published his essay \"Everybody's Protest Novel\" (collected in ''[[Notes of a Native Son]]''), in which he criticized Wright's portrayal of Bigger Thomas as stereotypical. In 1954 Wright published ''Savage Holiday.''\n\nAfter becoming a French citizen in 1947, Wright continued to travel through Europe, Asia, and Africa. He drew material from these trips for numerous nonfiction works. In 1949, Wright contributed to the anti-communist anthology ''[[The God That Failed]];'' his essay had been published in the ''[[Atlantic Monthly]]'' three years earlier and was derived from the unpublished portion of ''Black Boy.'' He was invited to join the [[Congress for Cultural Freedom]], which he rejected, correctly suspecting that it had connections with the [[CIA]]. Fearful of links between African Americans and communists, the [[FBI]] had Wright under surveillance starting in 1943. With the heightened communist fears of the 1950s, Wright was [[Hollywood blacklist|blacklisted]] by Hollywood movie studio executives. But in 1950, he starred as the teenager Bigger Thomas (Wright was 42) in an [[Argentina|Argentinian]] film version of ''[[Native Son (1951 film)|Native Son]].''\n\nIn mid-1953, Wright traveled to the [[Gold Coast (region)|Gold Coast]], where [[Kwame Nkrumah]] was leading the country to independence from British rule, to be established as [[Ghana]]. Before Wright returned to Paris, he gave a confidential report to the United States consulate in [[Accra]] on what he had learned about Nkrumah and his political party. After Wright returned to Paris, he met twice with an officer from the [[U.S. Department of State|US State Department]]. The officer's report includes what Wright had learned from Nkrumah adviser [[George Padmore]] about Nkrumah's plans for the Gold Coast after independence. Padmore, a [[Trinidad]]ian living in London, believed Wright to be a good friend. His many letters in the Wright papers at Yale's Beinecke Library attest to this, and the two men continued their correspondence. Wright's book on his African journey, ''[[Black Power (Richard Wright book)|Black Power]],'' was published in 1954; its London publisher was [[Dennis Dobson]], who also published Padmore's work.<ref>Carol Polsgrove, ''Ending British Rule in Africa: Writers in a Common Cause'' (2009), pp. 125\u201328.</ref>\n\nWhatever political motivations Wright had for reporting to American officials, he was also an American who wanted to stay abroad and needed their approval to have his passport renewed. According to Wright biographer [[Addison Gayle]], a few months later Wright talked to officials at the American embassy in Paris about people he had met in the Communist Party; at the time these individuals were being prosecuted in the US under the [[Smith Act]].<ref>Carol Polsgrove, ''Divided Minds: Intellectuals and the Civil Rights Movement'' (2001), p. 82.</ref>\n\nHistorian Carol Polsgrove explored why Wright appeared to have little to say about the increasing activism of the [[civil rights movement]] during the 1950s in the United States. She found that Wright was under what his friend Chester Himes called \"extraordinary pressure\" to avoid writing about the US.<ref name=\"polsgrove80-81\"/> As ''[[Ebony (magazine)|Ebony]]'' magazine delayed publishing his essay, \"I Choose Exile,\" Wright finally suggested publishing it in a white periodical.

He recorded his observations on the conference as well as on Indonesian cultural conditions in ''[[The Color Curtain|The Color Curtain: A Report on the Bandung Conference]].'' Wright was enthusiastic about the possibilities posed by this meeting of newly independent, former colonial nations. He gave at least two lectures to Indonesian cultural groups, including [[PEN Club]] Indonesia, and he interviewed Indonesian artists and intellectuals in preparation to write ''The Color Curtain.''<ref>{{cite book|last=Roberts|first=Brian|title=Artistic Ambassadors: Literary and International Representation of the New Negro Era|publisher=University of Virginia Press|location=Charlottesville|pages=153\u2013153, 161}}</ref> Several Indonesian artists and intellectuals whom  Wright met, later commented on how he had depicted Indonesian cultural conditions in his [[travel writing]].<!-- saying what? he got it or did not? --><ref>{{cite journal|last=Vuyk|first=Beb|title=A Weekend with Richard Wright|journal=PMLA|date=May 2011|volume=126|issue=3|pages=810|doi=10.1632/pmla.2011.126.3.798}}</ref>\n\nOther works by Richard Wright included ''White Man, Listen!'' (1957); a novel ''The Long Dream'' (1958), which was adapted as a play and produced in New York in 1960 by [[Ketti Frings]]. It explores the relationship between a man named Fish and his father.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/0904.html \"Richard Wright, Writer, 52, Dies\"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', November 30, 1960.</ref> A collection of [[short story|short stories]], ''Eight Men,'' was published posthumously in 1961, shortly after Wright's  death. These works dealt primarily with the poverty, anger, and protests of northern and southern urban black Americans.\n\nHis agent, Paul Reynolds, sent strongly negative criticism of Wright's 400-page ''Island of Hallucinations'' manuscript in February 1959. Despite that, in March Wright outlined a novel in which his character Fish was to be liberated from racial conditioning and become dominating. By May 1959, Wright wanted to leave Paris and live in London. He felt French politics had become increasingly submissive to United States pressure. The peaceful Parisian atmosphere he had enjoyed had been shattered by quarrels and attacks instigated by enemies of the expatriate black writers.\n\nOn June 26, 1959, after a party marking the French publication of ''White Man, Listen!,'' Wright became ill. He suffered a virulent attack of [[amoebic dysentery]], probably contracted during his 1953 stay on the Gold Coast. By November 1959 his wife had found a London apartment, but Wright's illness and \"four hassles in twelve days\" with British immigration officials ended his desire to live in England.\n\nOn February 19, 1960, Wright learned from his agent Reynolds that the New York premiere of the stage adaptation of ''The Long Dream'' received such bad reviews that the adapter, Ketti Frings, had decided to cancel further performances. Meanwhile, Wright was running into added problems trying to get ''The Long Dream'' published in France. These setbacks prevented his finishing revisions of ''Island of Hallucinations,'' for which he was trying to get a publication commitment from [[Doubleday and Sons]].\n\nIn June 1960, Wright recorded a series of discussions for French radio, dealing primarily with his books and literary career. He also addressed the racial situation in the United States and the world, and specifically denounced American policy in Africa. In late September, to cover extra expenses for his daughter Julia's move from London to Paris to attend the [[Sorbonne]], Wright wrote blurbs for record jackets for Nicole Barclay, director of the largest record company in Paris.\n\nIn spite of his financial straits, Wright refused to compromise his principles. He declined to participate in a series of programs for Canadian radio because he suspected American control. For the same reason, he rejected an invitation from the Congress for Cultural Freedom to go to India to speak at a conference in memory of [[Leo Tolstoy]]. Still interested in literature, Wright helped [[Kyle Onstott]] get his novel ''[[Mandingo (novel)|Mandingo]]'' (1957) published in France.\n\nWright's last display of explosive energy occurred on November 8, 1960, in his polemical lecture, \"The Situation of the Black Artist and Intellectual in the United States,\" delivered to students and members of the [[American Church in Paris]]. He argued that American society reduced the most militant members of the black community to slaves whenever they wanted to question the racial status quo. He offered as proof the subversive attacks of the Communists against ''Native Son'' and the quarrels which [[James Baldwin (writer)|James Baldwin]] and other authors sought with him. On November 26, 1960, Wright talked enthusiastically with Langston Hughes about his work ''Daddy Goodness'' and gave him the manuscript.\n\nHe died in Paris on November 28, 1960, of a [[heart attack]] at the age of 52. He was interred in [[Le P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery]].

In addition, in 1994, his novella ''Rite of Passage'' was published for the first time.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/13/books/children-s-books-black-history-bookshelf.html |title=Children's Books/Black History; Bookshelf |newspaper=The New York Times |date=February 13, 1994}}</ref>\n\nIn the last years of his life, Wright had become enamored of the Japanese poetic form [[Haiku in English|haiku]] and wrote more than 4,000 such short poems.

Many of these haikus have an uplifting quality even as they deal with coming to terms with loneliness, death, and the forces of nature.\n\nA collection of Wright's travel writings was published by [[Mississippi University Press]] in 2001.

The principal put pressure on one of Richard's uncles to speak to the boy and get him to change his mind, but Richard continued to be adamant about presenting his own speech, and refused to let his uncle edit it. Despite pressure even from his classmates, Richard delivered his speech as he had planned.\n\nIn September that year, Wright registered for mathematics, English, and history courses at the new [[Lanier High School (Jackson, Mississippi)|Lanier High School]], constructed for black students in Jackson\u2014the state's schools were segregated under its Jim Crow laws\u2014but he had to stop attending classes after a few weeks of irregular attendance because he needed to earn money for family expenses.<ref name=\"Rayson3\">Rayson, Ann. \"Richard Wright's Life.\" [http://www.english.illinois.edu/maps/poets/s_z/r_wright/wright_life.htm Modern American Poetry].

He planned to have his mother come to live with him when he could support her, and in 1926, his mother and younger brother did rejoin him. Shortly thereafter, Richard resolved to leave the [[Jim Crow economy|Jim Crow South]] and go to Chicago.<ref>{{Cite book|title= Black Boy |last= Wright |authorlink= |year= 1966 |publisher=Harper and Row |location= New York |isbn= |pages= 276\u2013278|url= }}</ref> His family joined the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]], when tens of thousands of blacks left the South to seek opportunities in the more economically prosperous northern and mid-western industrial cities.\n\nWright's childhood in Mississippi, as well as in Memphis, Tennessee, and Elaine, Arkansas, shaped his lasting impressions of American racism.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Black Boy |last=Wright |first=Richard |authorlink= |year=1993 |publisher=[[Harper Collins]] |location=New York |isbn=0-06-081250-8 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/blackboyamerican00wrig/page/455 455]\u2013459 |url=https://archive.org/details/blackboyamerican00wrig |url-access=registration }}</ref>\n\n=== Coming of age in Chicago ===\n\nWright and his family moved to Chicago in 1927. After securing employment as a United States postal clerk, during his time off, he read other writers and studied their styles. When he was fired from the post office during the [[Great Depression]], Wright was forced to go [[Federal Emergency Relief Administration|on relief]] in 1931. In 1932, he began attending meetings of the [[John Reed Club]]. As the club was dominated by the [[Communist Party USA|Communist Party]], Wright established a relationship with several party members. Especially interested in the literary contacts made at the meetings, Wright formally joined the Communist Party in late 1933. As a revolutionary poet, he wrote numerous proletarian poems (\"We of the Red Leaves of Red Books\", for example), for ''[[The New Masses]]'' and other [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] periodicals. A power struggle within the Chicago chapter of the John Reed Club had led to the dissolution of the club's leadership; Wright was told he had the support of the club's party members if he was willing to join the party.<ref>{{Cite book|last= Wright |first= Richard |authorlink= |editor= Crossman, Richard |title= The God That Failed |year= 1965 |publisher= [[Bantam Books]] |location= New York |language= |pages= 109\u201310 |chapter= Richard Wright |quote= |ref= }}</ref>\n\nBy 1935, Wright had completed the manuscript of his first novel, ''Cesspool'', which was published posthumously as ''Lawd Today'' (1963). In January 1936 his story \"Big Boy Leaves Home\" was accepted for publication in ''New Caravan.'' In February of that year, he began working with the [[National Negro Congress]]. In April he chaired the [[South Side Writers Group]], whose members included [[Arna Bontemps]] and [[Margaret Walker]]. Wright submitted some of his critical essays and poetry to the group for criticism and read aloud some of his short stories. Through the club, he edited ''Left Front,'' a magazine that the Communist Party shut down in 1937, despite Wright's repeated protests.<ref>{{Cite book|last= Wright |authorlink= |editor= Crossman |title= The God That Failed |year= 1965 |pages= 121 |chapter= Richard Wright |quote= |ref= }}</ref> Throughout this period, Wright continued to contribute to ''The New Masses'' magazine.\n\nPleased by his positive relations with white Communists in Chicago, Wright was later humiliated in New York City by some white party members who rescinded an offer to find housing for him when they learned his race.<ref>{{Cite book|last= Wright |authorlink= |editor= Crossman |title= The God That Failed |year= 1965 |pages= 123\u201326 |chapter= Richard Wright |quote= |ref= }}</ref>  Some black Communists denounced Wright as a \"[[bourgeois]] intellectual.\"  Wright was essentially [[Autodidacticism|autodidactic]].

He had developed a working relationship with a [[black nationalist]] communist, which, along with his dissatisfaction with the attitudes of and restrictions imposed by those in the party, led to a public falling out with the party and a number of its leading members. Wright later described this episode through his fictional character Buddy Nealson, [[The Communist Party and African-Americans|an African-American communist]] in his essay \"I tried to be a Communist\", published in the ''Atlantic Monthly'' in 1944. This text was an excerpt of his autobiography scheduled to be published as ''American Hunger'', but removed from the actual publication of ''[[Black Boy]]'' upon request by the [[Book of the Month Club]].<ref>{{Cite book|last= Wright |authorlink= |editor= Crossman|title= The God That Failed |year= 1960 |pages= 126\u201334 |chapter= Richard Wright |quote= |ref= }}.

He worked on the [[Federal Writers' Project]] guidebook to the city, ''New York Panorama'' (1938), and wrote the book's essay on [[Harlem]]. Wright became the Harlem editor of the ''[[Daily Worker]],'' a Communist newspaper. Through the summer and fall he wrote more than 200 articles for the ''Daily Worker'' and helped edit a short-lived literary magazine ''New Challenge.'' The year was also a landmark for Wright because he met and developed a friendship with writer [[Ralph Ellison]] that would last for years. He was awarded the ''[[Story (magazine)|Story]]'' magazine first prize of $500 for his short story \"Fire and Cloud\".<ref name=\"story\" />\n\nAfter receiving the ''Story'' prize in early 1938, Wright shelved his manuscript of ''Lawd Today'' and dismissed his literary agent, John Troustine. He hired Paul Reynolds, the well-known agent of poet [[Paul Laurence Dunbar]], to represent him. Meanwhile, the Story Press offered the publisher [[Harper & Row|Harper]] all of Wright's prize-entry stories for a book, and Harper agreed to publish the collection.\n\nWright gained national attention for the collection of four short stories entitled ''[[Uncle Tom's Children]]'' (1938). He based some stories on [[Lynching in the United States|lynching]] in the [[Deep South]]. The publication and favorable reception of ''Uncle Tom's Children'' improved Wright's status with the Communist party and enabled him to establish a reasonable degree of financial stability. He was appointed to the editorial board of ''New Masses.'' [[Granville Hicks]], a prominent literary critic and Communist sympathizer, introduced him at leftist teas in Boston. By May 6, 1938, excellent sales had provided Wright with enough money to move to Harlem, where he began writing the novel ''[[Native Son]],'' which he published in 1940.\n\nBased on his collected short stories, Wright applied for and was awarded a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]], which gave him a stipend allowing him to complete ''Native Son.'' During this period, he rented a room in the home of friends Herbert and Jane Newton, an interracial couple and prominent [[Communists]] whom Wright had known in Chicago.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=T6-lhNKL3ncC&pg=PT147&dq=Herbert%20and%20jane%20Newton#v=onepage&q=Herbert%20and%20jane%20Newton&f=false|title=Literary Brooklyn: The Writers of Brooklyn and the Story of American City Life|first=Evan|last=Hughes|date=August 16, 2011|publisher=Macmillan|accessdate=September 30, 2016|via=Google Books|isbn=9781429973069}}</ref> They had moved to New York and lived at 109 Lefferts Place in [[Brooklyn]] in the [[Fort Greene Historic District|Fort Greene]] neighborhood.<ref>Oleksinski, Johnny.

It was a daring choice. The lead character, Bigger Thomas, was a person bound by the limitations that society placed on African Americans. He gained his own [[Agency (philosophy)|agency]] and self-knowledge only by committing heinous acts.\n\nWright was criticized for his concentration on violence in his works. In the case of ''Native Son,'' people complained that he portrayed a black man in ways that seemed to confirm whites' worst fears. The period following publication of ''Native Son'' was a busy time for Wright. In July 1940 he went to Chicago to do research for a folk history of blacks to accompany photographs selected by [[Edwin Rosskam]]. While in Chicago he visited the ''American Negro Exhibition'' with [[Langston Hughes]], [[Arna Bontemps]] and [[Claude McKay]].\n[[File:Canada-Lee-Native-Son-1941.jpg|thumb|[[Canada Lee]] as Bigger Thomas in the [[Orson Welles]] production of ''[[Native Son (play)|Native Son]]'' (1941)]]\nHe traveled to [[Chapel Hill, North Carolina]], to collaborate with playwright [[Paul Green (playwright)|Paul Green]] on a dramatic adaptation of ''Native Son.'' In January 1941 Wright received the prestigious [[Spingarn Medal]] of the [[NAACP]] for noteworthy achievement. His play ''[[Native Son (play)|Native Son]]'' opened on Broadway in March 1941, with [[Orson Welles]] as director, to generally favorable reviews. Wright also wrote the text to accompany a volume of photographs chosen by Rosskam, which were almost completely drawn from the files of the [[Farm Security Administration]]. The FSA had employed top photographers to travel around the country and capture images of Americans. Their collaboration, ''Twelve Million Black Voices: A Folk History of the Negro in the United States,'' was published in October 1941 to wide critical acclaim.\n\nWright's memoir ''[[Black Boy]]'' (1945) described his early life from [[Roxie, Mississippi|Roxie]] up until his move to Chicago at age 19. It included his clashes with [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventist]] family, his troubles with white employers, and social isolation. It also describes his intellectual journey through these struggles. ''American Hunger'', which was published posthumously in 1977, was originally intended by Wright as the second volume of ''Black Boy.'' The [[Library of America]] edition of 1991 finally restored the book to its original two-volume form.\n\n''American Hunger'' detailed Wright's participation in the John Reed Clubs and the Communist Party, which he left in 1942. The book implied he left earlier, but he did not announce his withdrawal until 1944.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} In the book's restored form, Wright used the [[diptych]] structure to compare the certainties and intolerance of organized communism, which condemned \"bourgeois\" books and certain members, with similar restrictive qualities of fundamentalist organized religion. Wright disapproved of [[Joseph Stalin]]'s [[Great Purge]] in the [[Soviet Union]], but he continued to believe in far-left democratic solutions to political problems.\n\n===France===\n[[File:Plaque Richard Wright, 14 rue Monsieur-le-Prince, Paris 6.jpg|350px|thumbnail|Plaque commemorating Wright's residence in Paris, at 14, rue Monsieur le Prince.]]\n\nFollowing a stay of a few months in [[Qu\u00e9bec, Canada]], including a lengthy stay in the village of Sainte-P\u00e9tronille on the [[\u00cele d'Orl\u00e9ans]],<ref>Jean-Christophe Cloutier, Introduction to ''Jack Kerouac, La vie est d'hommage'' (Bor\u00e9al, 2016), pp. 31\u201332.</ref> Wright moved to Paris in 1946.

He also became friends with fellow expatriate writers [[Chester Himes]] and [[James Baldwin]]. His relationship with the latter ended in acrimony after Baldwin published his essay \"Everybody's Protest Novel\" (collected in ''[[Notes of a Native Son]]''), in which he criticized Wright's portrayal of Bigger Thomas as stereotypical. In 1954 Wright published ''Savage Holiday.''\n\nAfter becoming a French citizen in 1947, Wright continued to travel through Europe, Asia, and Africa. He drew material from these trips for numerous nonfiction works. In 1949, Wright contributed to the anti-communist anthology ''[[The God That Failed]];'' his essay had been published in the ''[[Atlantic Monthly]]'' three years earlier and was derived from the unpublished portion of ''Black Boy.'' He was invited to join the [[Congress for Cultural Freedom]], which he rejected, correctly suspecting that it had connections with the [[CIA]]. Fearful of links between African Americans and communists, the [[FBI]] had Wright under surveillance starting in 1943. With the heightened communist fears of the 1950s, Wright was [[Hollywood blacklist|blacklisted]] by Hollywood movie studio executives. But in 1950, he starred as the teenager Bigger Thomas (Wright was 42) in an [[Argentina|Argentinian]] film version of ''[[Native Son (1951 film)|Native Son]].''\n\nIn mid-1953, Wright traveled to the [[Gold Coast (region)|Gold Coast]], where [[Kwame Nkrumah]] was leading the country to independence from British rule, to be established as [[Ghana]]. Before Wright returned to Paris, he gave a confidential report to the United States consulate in [[Accra]] on what he had learned about Nkrumah and his political party. After Wright returned to Paris, he met twice with an officer from the [[U.S. Department of State|US State Department]]. The officer's report includes what Wright had learned from Nkrumah adviser [[George Padmore]] about Nkrumah's plans for the Gold Coast after independence. Padmore, a [[Trinidad]]ian living in London, believed Wright to be a good friend. His many letters in the Wright papers at Yale's Beinecke Library attest to this, and the two men continued their correspondence. Wright's book on his African journey, ''[[Black Power (Richard Wright book)|Black Power]],'' was published in 1954; its London publisher was [[Dennis Dobson]], who also published Padmore's work.<ref>Carol Polsgrove, ''Ending British Rule in Africa: Writers in a Common Cause'' (2009), pp. 125\u201328.</ref>\n\nWhatever political motivations Wright had for reporting to American officials, he was also an American who wanted to stay abroad and needed their approval to have his passport renewed. According to Wright biographer [[Addison Gayle]], a few months later Wright talked to officials at the American embassy in Paris about people he had met in the Communist Party; at the time these individuals were being prosecuted in the US under the [[Smith Act]].<ref>Carol Polsgrove, ''Divided Minds: Intellectuals and the Civil Rights Movement'' (2001), p. 82.</ref>\n\nHistorian Carol Polsgrove explored why Wright appeared to have little to say about the increasing activism of the [[civil rights movement]] during the 1950s in the United States. She found that Wright was under what his friend Chester Himes called \"extraordinary pressure\" to avoid writing about the US.<ref name=\"polsgrove80-81\"/> As ''[[Ebony (magazine)|Ebony]]'' magazine delayed publishing his essay, \"I Choose Exile,\" Wright finally suggested publishing it in a white periodical.

He recorded his observations on the conference as well as on Indonesian cultural conditions in ''[[The Color Curtain|The Color Curtain: A Report on the Bandung Conference]].'' Wright was enthusiastic about the possibilities posed by this meeting of newly independent, former colonial nations. He gave at least two lectures to Indonesian cultural groups, including [[PEN Club]] Indonesia, and he interviewed Indonesian artists and intellectuals in preparation to write ''The Color Curtain.''<ref>{{cite book|last=Roberts|first=Brian|title=Artistic Ambassadors: Literary and International Representation of the New Negro Era|publisher=University of Virginia Press|location=Charlottesville|pages=153\u2013153, 161}}</ref> Several Indonesian artists and intellectuals whom  Wright met, later commented on how he had depicted Indonesian cultural conditions in his [[travel writing]].<!-- saying what? he got it or did not? --><ref>{{cite journal|last=Vuyk|first=Beb|title=A Weekend with Richard Wright|journal=PMLA|date=May 2011|volume=126|issue=3|pages=810|doi=10.1632/pmla.2011.126.3.798}}</ref>\n\nOther works by Richard Wright included ''White Man, Listen!'' (1957); a novel ''The Long Dream'' (1958), which was adapted as a play and produced in New York in 1960 by [[Ketti Frings]]. It explores the relationship between a man named Fish and his father.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/0904.html \"Richard Wright, Writer, 52, Dies\"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', November 30, 1960.</ref> A collection of [[short story|short stories]], ''Eight Men,'' was published posthumously in 1961, shortly after Wright's  death. These works dealt primarily with the poverty, anger, and protests of northern and southern urban black Americans.\n\nHis agent, Paul Reynolds, sent strongly negative criticism of Wright's 400-page ''Island of Hallucinations'' manuscript in February 1959. Despite that, in March Wright outlined a novel in which his character Fish was to be liberated from racial conditioning and become dominating. By May 1959, Wright wanted to leave Paris and live in London. He felt French politics had become increasingly submissive to United States pressure. The peaceful Parisian atmosphere he had enjoyed had been shattered by quarrels and attacks instigated by enemies of the expatriate black writers.\n\nOn June 26, 1959, after a party marking the French publication of ''White Man, Listen!,'' Wright became ill. He suffered a virulent attack of [[amoebic dysentery]], probably contracted during his 1953 stay on the Gold Coast. By November 1959 his wife had found a London apartment, but Wright's illness and \"four hassles in twelve days\" with British immigration officials ended his desire to live in England.\n\nOn February 19, 1960, Wright learned from his agent Reynolds that the New York premiere of the stage adaptation of ''The Long Dream'' received such bad reviews that the adapter, Ketti Frings, had decided to cancel further performances. Meanwhile, Wright was running into added problems trying to get ''The Long Dream'' published in France. These setbacks prevented his finishing revisions of ''Island of Hallucinations,'' for which he was trying to get a publication commitment from [[Doubleday and Sons]].\n\nIn June 1960, Wright recorded a series of discussions for French radio, dealing primarily with his books and literary career. He also addressed the racial situation in the United States and the world, and specifically denounced American policy in Africa. In late September, to cover extra expenses for his daughter Julia's move from London to Paris to attend the [[Sorbonne]], Wright wrote blurbs for record jackets for Nicole Barclay, director of the largest record company in Paris.\n\nIn spite of his financial straits, Wright refused to compromise his principles. He declined to participate in a series of programs for Canadian radio because he suspected American control. For the same reason, he rejected an invitation from the Congress for Cultural Freedom to go to India to speak at a conference in memory of [[Leo Tolstoy]]. Still interested in literature, Wright helped [[Kyle Onstott]] get his novel ''[[Mandingo (novel)|Mandingo]]'' (1957) published in France.\n\nWright's last display of explosive energy occurred on November 8, 1960, in his polemical lecture, \"The Situation of the Black Artist and Intellectual in the United States,\" delivered to students and members of the [[American Church in Paris]]. He argued that American society reduced the most militant members of the black community to slaves whenever they wanted to question the racial status quo. He offered as proof the subversive attacks of the Communists against ''Native Son'' and the quarrels which [[James Baldwin (writer)|James Baldwin]] and other authors sought with him. On November 26, 1960, Wright talked enthusiastically with Langston Hughes about his work ''Daddy Goodness'' and gave him the manuscript.\n\nHe died in Paris on November 28, 1960, of a [[heart attack]] at the age of 52. He was interred in [[Le P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery]].

In addition, some of Wright's more shocking passages dealing with race, sex, and politics were cut or omitted before original publication of works during his lifetime.

In addition, in 1994, his novella ''Rite of Passage'' was published for the first time.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/13/books/children-s-books-black-history-bookshelf.html |title=Children's Books/Black History; Bookshelf |newspaper=The New York Times |date=February 13, 1994}}</ref>\n\nIn the last years of his life, Wright had become enamored of the Japanese poetic form [[Haiku in English|haiku]] and wrote more than 4,000 such short poems. In 1998 a book was published (''Haiku: This Other World'') with 817 of his own favorite haikus. Many of these haikus have an uplifting quality even as they deal with coming to terms with loneliness, death, and the forces of nature.\n\nA collection of Wright's travel writings was published by [[Mississippi University Press]] in 2001.

The choreography was staged by [[Busby Berkeley]]. The songs were written by [[Harry Warren]] (music) and [[Al Dubin]] (lyrics). The script was written by [[Rian James]] and James Seymour, with Whitney Bolton, who was not credited, from the 1932 novel of the same name by [[Bradford Ropes]].\n\nThis [[backstage musical]] was very successful at the box office and is now considered a classic by many.

She is involved with wealthy Abner Dillon ([[Guy Kibbee]]), the show's \"angel\" (financial backer), but while she is busy keeping him both hooked and at arm's length, she is secretly seeing her old [[vaudeville]] partner, out-of-work Pat Denning ([[George Brent]]).\n\nJulian Marsh ([[Warner Baxter]]) is hired to direct, although his doctor warns that he risks his life if he continues in his high-pressure profession. Despite a long string of successes, he is broke, a result of the 1929 [[Wall Street Crash of 1929|Stock Market Crash]], so he must make his last show a hit, in order to have enough money to retire.\n\nCast selection and rehearsals begin amidst fierce competition, with not a few \"[[casting couch]]\" innuendos flying around. Na\u00efve newcomer Peggy Sawyer ([[Ruby Keeler]]), who arrives in New York from her home in [[Allentown, Pennsylvania]], is duped and ignored until two experienced chorines, Lorraine Fleming ([[Una Merkel]]) and Ann \"Anytime Annie\" Lowell ([[Ginger Rogers]]),<ref name=Anytime/> take her under their wing. Lorraine is assured a job because of her relationship with dance director Andy Lee ([[George E. Stone]]); she also sees to it that Ann and Peggy are chosen. The show's juvenile lead, Billy Lawler ([[Dick Powell]]), takes an immediate liking to Peggy, as does Pat.\n[[File:JulPeg42ndSt1933Trailer.jpg|thumb|right|270px|Naive newcomer Peggy makes her first ''faux pas'', antagonizing tough director Julian Marsh]]\n\nWhen Marsh learns about Dorothy's relationship with Pat, he sends some thugs led by his gangster friend Slim Murphy ([[Tom Kennedy (American actor)|Tom Kennedy]]) to rough him up. That, plus her realization that their situation is unhealthy, makes Dorothy and Pat agree not to see each other for a while. He gets a stock job in Philadelphia.\n\nRehearsals continue for five weeks, to Marsh's complete dissatisfaction, until the night before the show's opening in Philadelphia, when Dorothy breaks her ankle. By the next morning Abner has quarreled with her and wants Julian to replace her with his new girlfriend, Annie. She, however, tells him that she can't carry the show, but the inexperienced Peggy can. With 200 jobs and his future riding on the outcome, a desperate Julian rehearses Peggy mercilessly (vowing \"I'll either have a live leading lady or a dead chorus girl\") until an hour before the premiere.\n\nBilly finally gets up the nerve to tell Peggy he loves her; she enthusiastically kisses him. Then Dorothy shows up and wishes her luck, telling her that she and Pat are getting married. The show goes on, and the last twenty minutes of the film are devoted to three [[Busby Berkeley]] production numbers: \"[[Shuffle Off to Buffalo]]\", \"(I'm) Young and Healthy\", and \"[[42nd Street (song)|42nd Street]]\".\n\nThe show is a hit. As the theater audience comes out, Julian stands in the shadows, hearing the comments that Peggy is a star and he (Marsh) does not deserve the credit for it.<ref>Green, Stanley (1999) Hollywood Musicals Year by Year (2nd ed.), pub.

It was cut for unknown reasons from the finished film, but an unpublished manuscript of this still exists.\n\nThough the songs of 42nd Street all allude to sex, there is a single moment at the end of \"Shuffle Off to Buffalo\", when one word of the scripted lyrics, \"belly\", was changed to \"tummy\" presumedly to comply with the then weakly enforced [[Motion Picture Production Code of 1930]]. But in making the change, the filmmakers purposely drew attention to the censored word.  During the last two verses, Una Merkel & Ginger Rogers sing about a traveling salesman who impregnates the farmer's daughter, and then is forced into a shotgun wedding. The lyric as [http://www.csus.edu/indiv/c/craftg/histhrs%20169/shuffle%20off%20to%20buffalo.pdf scripted] is: \"He did right by little Nellie, with a shotgun in his belly...\" But as Ginger sings it, Una gestures to her and she changes the last word: \"He did right by little Nellie, with a shotgun in his bel - - tummy\".\n\n==Reception and legacy==\nThe film premiered in New York on March 9, 1933 at the [[Mark Strand Theatre|Strand Theatre]], and went into general release two days later, becoming one of the most profitable ones of the year, bringing in an estimated gross of $2,300,000, equal to ${{Inflation|US|2300000|1933|fmt=c}} today.

Despite a long string of successes, he is broke, a result of the 1929 [[Wall Street Crash of 1929|Stock Market Crash]], so he must make his last show a hit, in order to have enough money to retire.\n\nCast selection and rehearsals begin amidst fierce competition, with not a few \"[[casting couch]]\" innuendos flying around. Na\u00efve newcomer Peggy Sawyer ([[Ruby Keeler]]), who arrives in New York from her home in [[Allentown, Pennsylvania]], is duped and ignored until two experienced chorines, Lorraine Fleming ([[Una Merkel]]) and Ann \"Anytime Annie\" Lowell ([[Ginger Rogers]]),<ref name=Anytime/> take her under their wing. Lorraine is assured a job because of her relationship with dance director Andy Lee ([[George E. Stone]]); she also sees to it that Ann and Peggy are chosen. The show's juvenile lead, Billy Lawler ([[Dick Powell]]), takes an immediate liking to Peggy, as does Pat.\n[[File:JulPeg42ndSt1933Trailer.jpg|thumb|right|270px|Naive newcomer Peggy makes her first ''faux pas'', antagonizing tough director Julian Marsh]]\n\nWhen Marsh learns about Dorothy's relationship with Pat, he sends some thugs led by his gangster friend Slim Murphy ([[Tom Kennedy (American actor)|Tom Kennedy]]) to rough him up. That, plus her realization that their situation is unhealthy, makes Dorothy and Pat agree not to see each other for a while. He gets a stock job in Philadelphia.\n\nRehearsals continue for five weeks, to Marsh's complete dissatisfaction, until the night before the show's opening in Philadelphia, when Dorothy breaks her ankle. By the next morning Abner has quarreled with her and wants Julian to replace her with his new girlfriend, Annie. She, however, tells him that she can't carry the show, but the inexperienced Peggy can. With 200 jobs and his future riding on the outcome, a desperate Julian rehearses Peggy mercilessly (vowing \"I'll either have a live leading lady or a dead chorus girl\") until an hour before the premiere.\n\nBilly finally gets up the nerve to tell Peggy he loves her; she enthusiastically kisses him. Then Dorothy shows up and wishes her luck, telling her that she and Pat are getting married. The show goes on, and the last twenty minutes of the film are devoted to three [[Busby Berkeley]] production numbers: \"[[Shuffle Off to Buffalo]]\", \"(I'm) Young and Healthy\", and \"[[42nd Street (song)|42nd Street]]\".\n\nThe show is a hit. As the theater audience comes out, Julian stands in the shadows, hearing the comments that Peggy is a star and he (Marsh) does not deserve the credit for it.<ref>Green, Stanley (1999) Hollywood Musicals Year by Year (2nd ed.), pub.

It was cut for unknown reasons from the finished film, but an unpublished manuscript of this still exists.\n\nThough the songs of 42nd Street all allude to sex, there is a single moment at the end of \"Shuffle Off to Buffalo\", when one word of the scripted lyrics, \"belly\", was changed to \"tummy\" presumedly to comply with the then weakly enforced [[Motion Picture Production Code of 1930]]. But in making the change, the filmmakers purposely drew attention to the censored word.  During the last two verses, Una Merkel & Ginger Rogers sing about a traveling salesman who impregnates the farmer's daughter, and then is forced into a shotgun wedding. The lyric as [http://www.csus.edu/indiv/c/craftg/histhrs%20169/shuffle%20off%20to%20buffalo.pdf scripted] is: \"He did right by little Nellie, with a shotgun in his belly...\" But as Ginger sings it, Una gestures to her and she changes the last word: \"He did right by little Nellie, with a shotgun in his bel - - tummy\".\n\n==Reception and legacy==\nThe film premiered in New York on March 9, 1933 at the [[Mark Strand Theatre|Strand Theatre]], and went into general release two days later, becoming one of the most profitable ones of the year, bringing in an estimated gross of $2,300,000, equal to ${{Inflation|US|2300000|1933|fmt=c}} today.

{"title_page": "2nd Portuguese India Armada (Cabral, 1500)", "text_new": "{{Refimprove|date=June 2010}}\n[[File:Pedro Alvares Cabral.jpg|thumb|Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral]]\nThe '''Second [[Portuguese India Armadas|Portuguese India Armada]]''' was assembled in 1500 on the order of King [[Manuel I of Portugal]] and placed under the command of [[Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral]].  Cabral's armada famously discovered [[Brazil]] for the Portuguese crown along the way. By and large, the Second Armada's diplomatic mission to [[India]] failed, and provoked the opening of hostilities between the [[Kingdom of Portugal]] and the feudal city-state of [[Kozhikode|Calicut]].  Nonetheless, it managed to establish a factory in the nearby [[Kingdom of Cochin]], the first Portuguese [[Factory (trading post)|factory]] in Asia.\n\n== Fleet ==\n\nThe [[1st Portuguese India Armada (Gama, 1497)|first India Armada]], commanded by [[Vasco da Gama]], arrived in Portugal in the summer of 1499, in rather sorry shape. Half of his ships and men had been lost thanks to battles, disease, and storms. Although Gama came back with a hefty cargo of spices that would be sold at enormous profit, he had failed in the principal objective of his mission: to negotiate a treaty with [[Kozhikode|Calicut]], the spice entrep\u00f4t on the [[Malabar Coast]] of India. Gama managed, however, to open the sea route to India via the [[Cape of Good Hope]] and secured good relations with the African city-state of [[Malindi]], a critical staging post along the way.\n\nOn King Manuel I's orders, arrangements were immediately made to begin the assembly of a second armada in [[Cascais]].  Determined not to repeat Gama's mistakes, this one was to be a large and well-armed fleet of 13 ships and 1500 men, laden with valuable gifts and diplomatic letters to win over the potentates of the east.\n\nMany details of the composition of the fleet are missing. Only three ship names are known, and there is some conflict among the sources on the captains.

Cabral had no notable naval or military experience; his appointment as ''capit\u00e3o-mor'' (captain-major) was largely politically motivated.  The exiled [[Crown of Castile|Castillian]] nobleman [[Sancho de Tovar]] was designated vice-admiral (''soto-capit\u00e3o'') and Cabral's successor should anything happen to him.<ref group=note>This is according to Castanheda and Dami\u00e3o de G\u00f3is. Gaspar Correia identifies Sim\u00e3o de Miranda as the predesignated successor instead.</ref>\n\nVeteran pilot [[Pedro Escobar]] was given the overall technical command of the expedition. Other veterans of the first armada included captain Nicolau Coelho, pilot [[P\u00earo de Alenquer]], and clerks Afonso Lopes and [[Jo\u00e3o de S\u00e1]].  The famed navigator Bartolomeu Dias, who was the first to double the Cape of Good Hope, and his brother Diogo Dias, who had served as clerk on Gama's ship, also served as captains. \n\nMost of the ships were either [[carracks]] (''naus'') or [[caravels]], and at least one was a small supply ship, although details on names and tonnage are missing.<ref group=note>Castanheda (1551) claims there were ten carracks and three caravels. The Anonymous Pilot refers to only twelve ships, plus a supply ship.</ref>  At least two ships, Cabral's flagship and Tovar's ''El Rei'', were said to be around 240 tons, that is, about twice the size of the largest ship in the first armada three years prior.\n\nTen ships were destined for [[Kozhikode|Calicut]] (Malabar, India), while the two ships headed by the Dias brothers were destined for [[Sofala]] in East Africa and the supply ship was destined to be scuttled and burnt along the way.<ref group=note>The Sofala destination of the Dias brothers is found in Castanheda (1551). It is confirmed in the Anonymous Pilot.</ref>\n\n[[File:Cabral armada of 1500 (Livro das Armadas).jpg|thumb|250px|left|Fleet of the 2nd India Armada (Cabral, 1500), from the ''Mem\u00f3ria das Armadas'']]\n\nAt least two ships were privately owned and outfitted: Lu\u00eds Pires's ship was owned by Diogo da Silva e Meneses, [[Count of Portalegre]], while Nuno Leit\u00e3o da Cunha's ''Anunciada'' was owned by the king's cousin D. [[\u00c1lvaro of Braganza]], and financed by an Italian consortium composed of the Florentine bankers [[Bartolomeo Marchionni]] and [[Girolamo Sernigi]] and the Genoese Antonio Salvago. The remainder belonged to the Portuguese crown.\n\nAccompanying the expedition as translator was [[Gaspar da Gama]], who was a Jew captured in Angediva by Vasco Gama, as well as four Hindu hostages from Calicut taken by Gama in 1498 during negotiations. Also aboard was the ambassador of the Sultan of Malindi, who had arrived at Portugal with Gama, and was set to return to Malindi with Cabral's expedition.\n\nOther passengers on the expedition included Aires Correia, the designated [[Factor (agent)|factor]] for Calicut, his secretary P\u00earo Vaz de Caminha, Afonso Furtado, the designated factor for Sofala, and clerk Martinho Neto.  Accompanying them on the trip was the royal physician and amateur astronomer, Master [[Jo\u00e3o Faras]], who brought along the latest astrolabe and new Arabic astronomical staves for navigational experiments.  One chronicler suggests that the knight [[Duarte Pacheco Pereira]] was also aboard.<ref group=note>[[Dami\u00e3o de G\u00f3is]] is the chronicler responsible for this claim.  This is not substantiated elsewhere.  Greenlee (1938, p. li) and Diffie and Winius (1977, p. 188fn) dismiss the possibility.</ref>\n\nThe fleet carried some twenty Portuguese ''[[degredado|degredados]]'', who were criminal convicts who could fulfill their sentences by being abandoned along the shores of various places and exploring inland on the crown's behalf. Four of the degredados are known: Afonso Ribeiro, Jo\u00e3o Machado, Luiz de Moura, and Antonio Fernandes, who was also a ship carpenter. \n\nFinally, the fleet carried eight [[Franciscan]] friars and eight chaplains, under the supervision of the head chaplain, Fr. Henrique Soares of Coimbra. They were the first Portuguese Christian missionaries to India.\n\nThere are three surviving eyewitness accounts of this expedition: (1) an extended letter written by P\u00earo Vaz de Caminha (possibly dictated by Aires Correia), written from Brazil on May 1, 1500, to King Manuel I; (2) the brief letter by Mestre [[Jo\u00e3o Faras]] to the king, also from Brazil; and (3) the account of an anonymous Portuguese pilot, first published in Italian in 1507 (commonly referred to as the ''Rela\u00e7\u00e3o do Piloto An\u00f4nimo'', sometimes believed to be the clerk [[Jo\u00e3o de S\u00e1]]).\n\n== Mission ==\n\nThe priority of the mission was to secure a treaty with [[Zamorin]]'s [[Kozhikode|Calicut]] (''Calecute'', Kozhikode), the principal commercial entrep\u00f4t of the [[Kerala]] spice trade and dominant feudal city-state on the [[Malabar coast]] of [[India]]. [[Vasco da Gama]]'s first armada had visited Calicut in 1498, but had failed to impress the elderly ruling Manivikraman Raja ('Samoothiri Raja'), the [[Zamorin of Calicut]]. As such, no agreements had been signed. Cabral's instructions were to succeed where Gama had failed, and to this end was entrusted with magnificent gifts to present to the Zamorin. Cabral was under orders to establish a ''feitoria'' ([[Factory (trading post)|factory]]) in Calicut, which would be placed under Aires Correia.\n\nThe second priority, assigned to Bartolomeu and Diogo Dias, was to search out the East African port of [[Sofala]], near the mouth of the [[Zambezi]] river.<ref>Anonymous Pilot, p. 107</ref> Sofala had been secretly visited and described by the explorer [[P\u00earo da Covilh\u00e3]] during his overland expedition a decade earlier (c. 1487), and he identified it as the endpoint of the [[Monomatapa]] gold trade.  The Portuguese crown was eager to tap into that gold source, but Gama's armada had failed to find it.  The Dias brothers were instructed to find and establish a factory at Sofala under designated factor Afonso Furtado.  To this end, the brothers were likely also instructed to secure the consent of [[Kilwa Sultanate|Kilwa]] (''Qu\u00edloa''), the dominant city-state of the East African coast and putative overlord of Sofala.  \n\nA minor objective included the delivery of a group of [[Franciscan]] missionaries to India. It is said that Vasco da Gama had misinterpreted the [[Hinduism]] he saw practiced in India as a form of \"primitive\" Christianity.  He believed its peculiar characteristics were a result of centuries of separation from the mainstream church in Europe. As such, Gama recommended that missionaries be sent to India to help bring the practices of the \"Hindu church\" up to date with Roman Catholic orthodoxy.  To this end, a group of Franciscan friars, led by Fr. Henrique Soares of Coimbra, joined the expedition.\n\nAs a final objective, the Second Armada was also a commercial spice run. The crown and private merchants who had outfitted the ships expected full cargoes of spices to return to Lisbon. \n\n=== Suspected Brazilian mission ===\n\nThere has been some debate over whether Cabral also had secret instructions from the king to lay claim to the landmass of Brazil\u2014or, more precisely, to swing as far west as possible to the [[Treaty of Tordesillas|Tordesillas line]] and claim whatever lands or islands might be discovered there for the Portuguese crown, before the Spanish did.<ref>{{cite book|last=Peres |first=Dami\u00e3o |date=1949 |title=O descobrimento do Brasil por Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral: antecedentes e intencionalidade |language=Portuguese}}</ref> Among the pieces of evidence is an indication of an island in the area in a 1448 map of [[Andrea Bianco]], apparently alluded to in the letter of Master Jo\u00e3o Faras; there is also the suggestion by [[Duarte Pacheco Pereira]] in his ''Esmeraldo de Situ Orbis'' that he had been sent on an expedition to a western landmass in 1498.<ref>{{cite book|last=Pacheco Pereira |first=Duarte |date=c. 1505 |title=Esmeraldo de Situ Orbis |url=https://archive.org/details/esmeraldodesitu00peregoog/page/n62/mode/2up |chapter=Cap 2: Da cantidade & grandeza da terra, & daugua qual destas he a mayor parte. |language=Portuguese}}</ref> That is about the full extent of the evidence of intentionality and this claim is largely speculative.<ref>{{cite book|last=Greenlee |first=William Brooks |date=1938 |pages=l\u2013lv |title=The Voyage of Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral to Brazil and India: from contemporary documents and narratives |publisher=Routledge |isbn=1409414485}}</ref> There are various reasons to presume the existence of such instructions unlikely.\n\nSpanish explorers had certainly been tending south at that time. Christopher Columbus]had touched the coast of the South American mainland around [[Guyana]] in 1498 on his [[Voyages of Christopher Columbus#Third voyage|third trip]]. In late 1499, [[Alonso de Ojeda]] had discovered much of the [[Venezuela|Venezuelan]] coast and in early 1500, [[Vicente Y\u00e1\u00f1ez Pinz\u00f3n]] and [[Diego de Lepe]], via generous southerly swings from the [[Canary islands]], had reached at least what is now [[Cear\u00e1]], and perhaps went as far east as [[Cabo de Santo Agostinho|Cape of Santo Agostinho]] in [[Pernambuco]]. They had explored much of the northern Brazilian coast west of it. It is possible that the southerly Spanish tendencies were deliberate, aimed at securing more land for the Spanish crown.<ref group=note>Although the person from whom the Spanish crown was trying to claim land was not the king of Portugal, as that was already mediated by Tordesillas, but Christopher Columbus, their own vice-roy of the Indies. Ojeda, Pinz\u00f3n, and Lepe were all dispatched on separate royal capitulations by [[Juan Rodr\u00edguez de Fonseca|Bishop Fonseca]], an enemy of Columbus, with the deliberate intent of finding and claiming lands ''outside'' (i.e., to the south) of the Columbus-owned West Indian islands, thereby circumscribing Columbus's viceroyalty and limiting him to the islands he already had. This would figure in later lawsuits by the Columbus family.</ref>\n\nThese expeditions, however, were too recent for their results to have been known in Lisbon before Cabral's departure in March 1500; indeed, they were unknown in Spain itself. It is very doubtful that the Portuguese were aware of them. Even if they were, it would not seem sensible for Cabral's Second Armada to be instructed to deviate from its original mission in India to pursue exploratory work which be far more efficiently accomplished by smaller caravels. \n\n== Outward journey ==\n\n[[File:Cabral armada of 1500 (Livro de Lisuarte de Abreu).jpg|thumb|350px|Fleet of the 2nd India Armada (Cabral, 1500), from the ''Livro de Lisuarte de Abreu'']]\nOn March 9, Cabral's expedition set out from the [[Tagus]]. Thirteen days later, on March 22, Cabral's armada reached the island of [[S\u00e3o Nicolau, Cape Verde|S\u00e3o Nicolau]] in the middle of a storm.  The privately outfitted ship of Lu\u00eds Pires was too damaged by the tempest to continue, and returned to Lisbon<ref>According to Barros (1552, II.5.2 [https://books.google.com/books?id=Epo2AAAAMAAJ&dq=editions%3AUOM39015057112644&lr&as_brr=1&pg=PA386#v=onepage&q&f=false p.386]); also Castanheda (1551), G\u00f3is (1566).</ref><ref group=note>Caminha's eyewitness account made no mention of Pires and instead reported that it was the Vasco de Ataide's crown ship that was lost around Cape Verde.</ref>\n\nFrom Cape Verde, Cabral went southwest. It is unknown why he chose such an unusual direction, but the most probable hypothesis is that he was simply following the wide arc in the South Atlantic to catch a favorable wind to carry them to the Cape of Good Hope. Navigationally, the arc is sensible. From Cape Verde, the ship would cut across the [[doldrums]] below the equator, catch the southwest-bound [[South Equatorial Current|equatorial drift]], and turn into the southbound [[Brazil Current]] that will carry them down to the [[horse latitudes]] (30\u00b0S), where the prevailing [[westerlies]] begin.  The westerlies would easily carry the ships across the South Atlantic around the Cape of Good Hope. If instead of this arc, Cabral attempted to strike southeast from Cape Verde, it would go into the [[Gulf of Guinea]]. To reach the Cape from there would be a struggle, as Cabral would have had to sail against the southeasterly [[trade wind|trade winds]], as well as the [[Benguela Current]]. \n\nHow Cabral knew of this arc is unknown. Most likely, this was precisely the route followed by Gama on his first trip in 1497. The veterans of the first fleet\u2014notably the pilots Alenquer and Escobar\u2014would very likely have charted the same route for Cabral again.<ref group=note>That this arc was sailed by Gama in 1497 is uncertain, but most modern historians have come to accept that he did. How did Gama know about the arc when no one had yet sailed it before? Some have speculated that the Portuguese crown might have dispatched secret exploratory expeditions to those waters in advance. The more widely accepted hypothesis, first forwarded by admiral [[Gago Coutinho]], is more straightforward: Since Bartolomeu Dias's 1488 expedition discovered the westerlies, the South Atlantic arc became \"navigationally obvious\" to any sensible pilot, especially pilots as experienced as Alenquer and Escobar. See Gago Coutinho (1951\u201352) ''A Nautica dos Descobrimentos: os descobrimentos maritimos visitos por um navegador'', 2 vols., Lisbon: Agencia Geral do Ultramar.</ref> Indeed, in the Lisbon archives, there is a draft of a document intended for Cabral that instructs him to strike in a southwesterly direction when he reaches the doldrums.<ref>After Cape Verde, where the wind is weak ('vento escasso') the ships should strike in the open ocean arc ('ir na volta do mar'), until the Cape of Good Hope, as this is the shorter route ('a navega\u00e7\u00e3o ser\u00e1 mais breve'). See Fonseca (1908, p. 211; see also p.224) [https://books.google.com/books?id=A7lI4gqh7PsC&pg=PA208#v=onepage&q&f=false copy of letter]; see also Greenlee (1938, p. 167)</ref> \n\nAlternative hypotheses forwarded for Cabral striking southwest are that he was trying to reach the [[Azores]] to repair his storm-battered fleet, that he was searching for and rounding up missing tempest-tossed ships, or that it was an intentional attempt to discover if there was any land by the Tordesillas line.\n\n=== Discovery of Brazil ===\n\nCabral took the same path as Gama had, but made a slightly wider arc and went further west than Gama had. As a result, he hit upon the hitherto unknown landmass of Brazil. After nearly 30 days of sailing (44 since departure), on April 21, Cabral's fleet found the first indications of nearby land.<ref>{{cite book|last=Fonseca |first=Faustino da |date=1908 |page=225 |title=A Descoberta to Brasil |language=Portuguese |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A7lI4gqh7PsC&pg=PA208#v=onepage&q&f=false |publisher=Livraria Central de Gomes de Carvalho |place=Lisbon}}</ref> The next day, the armada caught sight of the Brazilian coast, seeing the outlines of a hill they named [[Monte Pascoal]].\n\nThe armada anchored at the mouth of the [[Do Frade River|Frade river]] the next day, and a group of local [[Tupiniquim]] Indians assembled on the beach. Cabral dispatched a small party, headed by Nicolau Coelho, in a longboat ashore to make first contact. Coelho tossed his hat in exchange for a feathered headdress, but the surf was too strong for a proper landing and opening of communication, so they returned to the ships.<ref>{{cite book|last=Fonseca |first=Faustino da |date=1908 |pages=241\u2013242 |title=A Descoberta to Brasil |language=Portuguese |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A7lI4gqh7PsC&pg=PA208#v=onepage&q&f=false |publisher=Livraria Central de Gomes de Carvalho |place=Lisbon}}</ref>\n\nStrong overnight winds prompted the armada to lift anchor and sail some 10 leagues (45&nbsp;km) north, finding harbor behind the reef at Cabr\u00e1lia Bay, just north of [[Porto Seguro]].  The pilot Afonso Lopes, while [[Sounding line|sounding]] in a rowboat, spotted a native canoe, captured the two Indians on board, and brought them back to ship. The language barrier prevented questioning, but they were fed and given cloth and beads. The cultural difference was apparent: The natives spat out their honey and cake and were deeply surprised upon seeing a chicken.<ref>Guia politicamente incorreto da Hist\u00f3ria do Brasil, Leandro Narloch</ref>\n\nThe next day, on April 25, a party led by Coelho and Bartolomeu Dias went ashore, accompanied by the two natives. Armed Tupiniquim warily approached the beach, but upon a signal from the two natives, set down their bows, and allowed the Portuguese to land and collect water.\n\n[[File:Meirelles-primeiramissa2.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''The First Mass in Brazil'' by [[Victor Meirelles]] (1861)]]\n\nOn April 26, the Octave of Easter Sunday, the Franciscan friar Henrique Soares of Coimbra went ashore to celebrate mass in front of 200 Tupiniquim Indians.  This is the first known Christian mass on the American mainland.\n\nInteraction between the Portuguese and the Tupiniquim gradually increased throughout the week.  European iron nails, cloth, beads, and crucifixes were traded for American amulets, spears, parrots, and monkeys. There was only the slightest hint that precious metals might be found in the hinterlands. Portuguese ''degredados'' are assigned to spend the night in Tupiniquim villages, while the rest of the crew sleeps aboard ships.\n\n[[File:Carta-caminha.png|thumb|150px|Facsimile of P\u00earo Vaz de Caminha's letter to the king, reporting the discovery of the \"Island of the True Cross\" (Brazil)]]\n\nOn May 1, Cabral makes preparations to resume the journey to India. The Portuguese pilots, assisted by the physician-astronomer Master Jo\u00e3o Faras, determined that Brazil lay east of the Tordesillas line, prompting Cabral to formally claim it for the Portuguese crown, bestowing upon it the name of ''Ilha de Vera Cruz'' (\"Island  of the True Cross\"). It was later renamed ''Terra de Santa Cruz''\u2014\"Land of the Holy Cross\"\u2014upon the realization that it was not an island).<ref group=note>Gaspar Correia ([https://books.google.com/books?id=YmVKAAAAYAAJ&dq=editions%3ALCCN05022145&as_brr=1&pg=PA152#v=onepage&q&f=false p.152]) and Jo\u00e3o de Barros ([https://books.google.com/books?id=Epo2AAAAMAAJ&dq=editions%3AUOM39015057112644&lr&as_brr=1&pg=PA391#v=onepage&q&f=false p.391]) say it was named \"Santa Cruz\" from the start, with Correia saying it was named so because the departure date was the [[Feast of the Cross]] on the liturgical calendar.

The fleet faced headlong winds for six straight days and four ship\u2014Bartolomeu Dias's, Aires Gomes da Silva's, Sim\u00e3o de Pina's, and Vasco de Ata\u00edde's\u2014are lost at sea in the process.<ref>Castanheda (1551)</ref><ref>Barros (1552)</ref><ref>G\u00f3is (1566)</ref><ref group=note>The ''Rela\u00e7ao das Naos'' mistakenly substitutes Sim\u00e3o de Miranda for Sim\u00e3o da Pina in the losses, although this is corrected in the marginal gloss. Gaspar Correia (1550) almost concurs\u2014but as he does not have Aires Gomes da Silva on his original captain list, he identifies the fourth ship lost as Gaspar de Lemos. Similarly, the ''Livro de Lisuarte d'Abreu'' (1563), which has neither Pina nor Gomes da Silva on its list, say it was Diogo de Figueir\u00f3 and Luis Pires who were lost.  Diogo do Couto (c.1600) mistakenly adds P\u00earo d'Ataide to the list, bringing the losses to five. Some scholars also contend that Pires was lost at this point, and Vasco de Ata\u00edde had been lost earlier at Cape Verde.</ref> In this way, the fleet was reduced to seven ships. Facing strong winds, the armada split into smaller groups to meet again on the other side. Cabral's ship went with two others.\n\nOn June 16, 1500, Cabral's three-ship squadron reached the [[Primeiras and Segundas Archipelago|Primeiras Islands]] several leagues north of Sofala.  Two local merchant ships, catching sight of Cabral, took flight. Cabral gave pursuit\u2014one of them runs aground and the other is captured. Upon questioning, it was discovered that these ships were owned by a cousin of the sultan Fateima of Malindi (who had received Vasco da Gama in 1498), so they were released. \n\nThe three ships landed on [[Mozambique Island]] on June 22. Despite the earlier quarrel with his ships, Cabral was given a warm reception by the Sultan of Mozambique and was allowed to collect water and supplies.  Shortly after, three more ships of the Second Armada sailed into the island and joined with Cabral.  Only the ship of Diogo Dias remained missing.  As Dias's mission was for Sofala anyway, Cabral decided not to wait for it and instead pressed on with his fleet of six ships.\n\n[[File:Map of Cabral route, 1500.gif|thumb|340px|Approximate route of outward journey of Cabral's 2nd Armada (also route of stray ship of Diogo Dias)]]\n\nMore than a month later, on July 26, Cabral's armada reached [[Kilwa Kisiwani|Kilwa]], the dominant city-state of the East African coast and which Gama had never visited. Afonso Furtado, who had been appointed factor for Sofala in Lisbon and had escaped death (Furtado had been aboard Bartolomeu Dias's ship, but moved to the flagship just before the Cape crossing), went ashore to open negotiations with the strongman ruler, Emir Ibrahim.<ref group=note>At the time, there was no ruling [[Kilwa Sultanate|Sultan of Kilwa]] as the previous one, al-Fudail, had been deposed in a coup (c. 1495) by his minister, Emir Ibrahim, who had since ruled Kilwa with a vacant throne.</ref>\n\nA meeting was arranged between Cabral and Ibrahim, conducted on a couple of rowboats in the harbor. Cabral presents a letter from King Manuel I proposing a treaty, but Ibrahim was suspicious and remained resistant to the overtures. Cabral, sensing Ibrahim's resistance and worrying that they might miss the monsoon winds to India, broke off the negotiations and sailed on.\n\nPressing north, the Cabral fleet avoided the hostile [[Mombassa]] (''Momba\u00e7a'') and finally reached friendly Malindi (''Melinde'') on August 2.  There, he was well-received by the Sultan of Malindi and dropped off the Malindi ambassador that Gama had taken the previous year.  Leaving behind  two ''degredados'', Lu\u00eds de Moura and Jo\u00e3o Machado, and picking up two Gujarati pilots, Cabral's six-ship armada finally began its Indian Ocean crossing on August 7, 1500.\n\n== Cabral in India ==\n{{Refimprove-section|date=April 2020}}\nAfter an uneventful ocean crossing, Cabral's six ships landed on [[Anjediva Island]] (''Angediva'', Anjadip) on August 22, where they rested and repaired and repainted the ships.\n\nSailing down the Indian coast, Cabral's expedition finally reached [[Kozhikode|Calicut]] on September 13. Gaily decorated native boats came out to greet them, but remembering Gama's experience, Cabral refused to go ashore until hostages were exchanged. He dispatched Afonso Furtado and the four Calicut hostages taken by Gama the previous year to negotiate the details of the landing. When the negotiation was complete, Cabral finally went ashore himself and met the new Zamorin of Calicut. Cabral presents him with much finer and more luxurious gifts than Gama had brought, and more respectful and personalized letters of address from King Manuel I of Portugal.\n\nA commercial treaty was successfully negotiated and the Zamorin gave Cabral a security-of-trade certificate etched on a silver plate. The Portuguese were permitted to establish a ''feitoria]]'' in Calicut. Aires Correia went ashore with around 70 men. Once the factory was set up, Cabral released the ship hostages as a sign of trust and Correia set about buying spices in Calicut's markets for the ships to take home.\n\nSometime in October, the Zamorin of Calicut dispatched a service request to Cabral's idling fleet. Arab merchants allied with the rival city-state of [[Cochin kingdom|Cochin]] were returning from [[Ceylon]] with a cargo of war elephants destined for the Sultan of [[Cambay]]. Claiming it to be illegal contraband, the Zamorin asked Cabral to intercept them. Cabral sent one of his caravels under P\u00earo de Ata\u00edde to capture it.  Hoping for a spectacle, the Zamorin himself came down to the beachfront to witness the engagement, but left in disgust when the Arab ship slipped past Ataide, who gave chase and eventually caught up to it near Cannanore] He successfully seized the vessel and Cabral presented the captured ship, with its nearly intact elephant cargo, to the Zamorin as a gift.\n\n=== Calicut Massacre ===\n\nBy December of 1500, factor Aires Correia was still only able to buy enough spices to load two of the ships. He complained to Cabral his suspicions that the guild of Arab merchants in Calicut had been colluding to shut out Portuguese purchasing agents from the city's spice markets. Arab traders had reportedly used similar tactics to drive out Chinese merchants earlier in the 15th century from various ports on the [[Malabar Coast]]. Correia thought that it would make sense if they repeated this, particularly as the Portuguese had been clear with their hatred of \"the Moors\" and had demanded trading privileges and preferences.<ref group=note>Historians now think that the Portuguese traders may have in fact been unwitting counters in ongoing quarrels between competing older and newer Arab merchant guilds in Calicut. They may also have been used as pawns in the personal power struggles among the Zamorin's leading advisors.</ref>\n\nCabral presented Correia's complaint to the Zamorin, and requested that he crack down on the Arab merchant guild or enforce Portuguese priority in the spice markets. But the Zamorin refused Cabral's demand that he actively intervene in the market. \n\nFrustrated by the Zamorin's inaction, Cabral decided to take matters into his own hands. On December 17, on the advice of Aires Correia, Cabral ordered the seizure of an Arab merchant ship from [[Jeddah]], which had been loaded up with spices. He claimed that the Zamorin had promised the Portuguese priority in the spice markets, and so the cargo was rightfully theirs. Incensed, the Arab merchants around the quay immediately raised a riot in Calicut and direct mobs to attack the Portuguese factory. The Portuguese ships, anchored out in the harbor and unable to approach the docks, could only watch the unfolding massacre. After three hours of fighting, 53 (though some sources say 70) Portuguese were slaughtered by the mobs\u2014including the factor Aires Correia, the secretary Caminha, and three (some say five) of the Franciscan friars.  Around twenty Portuguese in the city managed to escape the riot by jumping into the harbor waters and swimming to the ships. The survivors reported to Cabral that the Zamorin's own guards were seen either standing aside or actively helping the rioters. At least one Portuguese, a man called Gon\u00e7alo Peixoto, was sheltered from the mob by a local merchant (whom the chronicles call \"Coja Bequij\") and survived the massacre. \n\nAfter the Calicut massacre, the wares in the Portuguese factory were impounded by the Calicut authorities.\n\n=== War with Calicut ===\n\nIncensed at the attack on the factory, Cabral waited one day for redress by the Zamorin.  When this did not arrive, Cabral and the Portuguese seized around ten Arab merchant ships then in harbor between December 18 and 22. They confiscated the ships' cargoes, killed the crews, and burned their ships. Then, accusing the Zamorin of sanctioning the riot, Cabral ordered a full day [[shore bombardment]] of Calicut, doing immense damage to the unfortified city. Estimates of Calicut casualties reach up to 600. Cabral proceeded to also bomb the nearby Zamorin-owned port of Pandarane.<ref group=note>The port of Pandarane has since disappeared. Its location is usually identified as 'Pantalyini Kollam', a port that has since been annexed by the growing city of [[Koyilandy]]; it is also sometimes identified with modern [[Kappad]]. (Dames, 1918, p.85)</ref>\n\nThis marked the beginning of the war between the Kingdom of Portugal and the Zamorin of Calicut. The war dragged on for the next decade and became an important focus of future armadas. It ultimately dictated Portuguese strategy in the Indian Ocean and overturned the political order on the Malabar Coast of India.\n\n=== Alliance with Cochin kingdom ===\n\n[[File:Kerala cities at time of Cabral (1500).gif|thumb|250px|India Malabar Coast c. 1500]]\nOn December 24, Cabral left the smoldering Calicut, unsure of what to do next. At the suggestion of Gaspar da Gama, the Goese Jew who had been accompanying the expedition, Cabral set sail south along the coast toward Cochin kingdom (''Cochim'', Kochi or Perumpadappu Swarupam), a small Hindu [[Nair]] city-state at the outlet of the [[Vembanad Lake|Vembanad lagoon]] in the Kerala backwaters. Partly in vassalage to and partly at war with Zamorin's Calicut, Cochin had long chafed at the dominance of its larger neighbor and was looking for an opportunity to break away.\n\nArriving in Cochin, a Portuguese emissary and a [[Saint Thomas Christians|Christian]] picked up in Calicut went ashore to make contact with the Trimumpara Raja (Unni Goda Varma), the Nair Hindu prince of Cochin.<ref group=note>The exact status of the Trimumpara Raja is a bit unclear.  It seems that the formal ruler of Cochin was the king of [[Edapalli]], which was across the lagoon on the mainland, but that the Cochinese peninsula (with capital at [[Perumpadappu (Malappuram district)|Perumpadappu]]) had at some point been detached as an appanage for a son, who, in turn, had detached the northern tip, Cochin proper, for another son. Moreover, it seems that these appanages were not supposed to be permanent fiefs, but rather to serve as temporary \"training grounds\" for princely heirs before they moved up in succession order. In other words, the ruler of Cochin was the second heir of Edapalli. Upon the death of the ruler of Edapalli, the first heir was meant to leave the peninsula and take up his duties in Edapalli, and the second heir would from Cochin to Perumpadappu, and assign Cochin to his own successor (the new second heir). The Portuguese seem to have arrived at a time when the princely heirs were somewhat at odds with one another, for some reason or another. It was only under Portuguese protection that the rulers of Cochin finally became proper kings in their own right.  Thus the Raja Trimumpara's search for a Portuguese alliance possibly had more to do with his own family quarrels than with the exactions of the Zamorin of Calicut.  See Dames (1918: p.86n).</ref> The Portuguese were greeted warmly, with the bombardment of Calicut outweighing the earlier matter of the war elephants. With all the cordialities and hostage-swapping completed quickly, Cabral himself went ashore and negotiated a treaty of alliance between Portugal and Cochin, directed against Zamorin's Calicut. Cabral promised to make the Trimumpara Raja of Cochin the ruler of kingdom of Calicut upon the city's capture.\n\nA Portuguese factory is set up in Cochin, with Gon\u00e7alo Gil Barbosa as chief factor. The spice markets of the smaller Cochin were not nearly as well-supplied as those of Calicut, but the trade was good enough to begin loading ships.  The stay in Cochin was not, however, without incident. The factory was set ablaze one evening, likely at the instigation of Arab traders in the city. The Trimumpara Raja, in contrast with the Zamorin of Calicut, cracked down on the arsonists. He took the Portuguese under his protection by having the factors stay in his palace and assigned his personal Nair guards to escort the factors in the city markets and protect the factory against further incidents.\n\nIn early January of 1501, while in Cochin, Cabral received missives from the rulers of Cannanore (''Canonor'', Kannur or Kolathunad), one of Calicut's reluctant rivals in the north, and [[Quilon]] (''Coul\u00e3o'', Kollam or Venad Swarupam), which was further south and had once been a great Syrian Christian merchant city-state, being an entrep\u00f4t for cinnamon, ginger, and dyewood.  They commended Cabral's actions against Calicut and invited the Portuguese to trade in their cities instead. Not wishing to offend his Cochinese host, Cabral declined the invitations, only promising to visit the cities at some future date.\n\nWhile still in Cochin, Cabral received yet another invitation, this one from the nearby [[Kodungallur Kovilakam|Cranganore kingdom]] (''Cranganor'', Kodungallur). The once-great capital of the [[Chera dynasty]] of [[Sangam period]] had recently been facing various natural disasters. The channels that connected Cranganore to the waterways were silted up, breaking open a competing sea outlet by Cochin in the 14th century.<ref group=note>Cochin was originally just a village along a long embankment.  Violent overflows of the [[Periyar River]] in 1341 forced the opening of the outlet between the Vembanad lagoon and the Arabian Sea at the juncture where Cochin now sits, separating the long Cochinese peninsula from what is now [[Vypin]] island. See Hunter's ''Imperial Gazetteer'' (1908, p.360).</ref> Cochin's rise had been principally due to the re-routing of commercial traffic away from Cranganore. Nonetheless, the remaining merchants of the dwindling city still maintained their old connections to the Kerala pepper plantations in the interior. Finding the supply in Cochin running low, Cabral took up the offer to load some cargo at Cranganore.\n\nThe visit to Cranganore turned out to be an eye-opener for the Portuguese, for among the city's remaining inhabitants are substantial established communities of [[Cochin Jews|Malabari Jews]] and [[Syrian Malabar Nasrani|Syrian Christians]].  The encounter with a clearly recognizable Christian community in Kerala confirmed to Cabral what the Franciscan friars had already suspected back in Calicut, namely that Vasco da Gama's earlier hypothesis about a \"Hindu Church\" was mistaken. If real Christians had existed alongside Hindus in India for centuries, after all, then clearly Hinduism must be a distinct religion. Hindus were \"heathen idolaters\", as the Portuguese friars characterized them, rather than adherents to a \"primitive\" form of Christianity.  Two Syrian Christian priests from Cranganore applied to Cabral for passage to Europe.<ref group=note>One of these priests, known as Jos\u00e9 de Cranganore or Joseph the Indian (''Josephus Indus''), eventually would provide instrumental intelligence about India to the Portuguese. Upon arrival in Lisbon, Joseph the Indian spent a couple of years being intensely interviewed by the Portuguese court and the [[Casa da \u00cdndia]], relating to them his detailed knowledge of the history and geography of India and the east, expanding Portuguese intelligence dramatically. It is likely that the detailed depiction of the east Indian coast and the [[Bay of Bengal]] in the [[Cantino planisphere]] of 1502 is owed in large part to this information.  Around 1503, Joseph went to Rome to meet [[Pope Alexander VI]] and report on the condition of the Malabari Syrian Christian church.  It was on this trip that Joseph dictated his famous narrative on India to an Italian scribe, which was eventually published in 1507 (in Italian) as part of a collection, ''Paesi Novamente Retrovati'', edited by Fracanzio da Montalboddo.  The narrative includes Joseph's own account of Cabral's expedition.  See Vallavanthara (2001).</ref>\n\nOn January 16, 1501, news arrived that the Zamorin of Calicut had assembled and dispatched a fleet of around 80 boats against the Portuguese in Cochin.  Despite the Trimumpara Raja of Cochin's offer of military assistance against the Calicut fleet, Cabral decided to precipitously lift anchor and slip away rather than risk a confrontation. Cabral's armada left behind the factor Gon\u00e7alo Gil Barbosa and six assistants in Cochin. In their hasty departure, the Portuguese inadvertently took along two of the Trimumpara's officers (Idikkela Menon and Parangoda Mennon), who had been serving as hostages aboard the vessels.\n\nHeading north, Cabral's armada took a wide sweep to avoid Calicut, and paid a quick visit to Cannanore. Cabral was warmly received by the [[Kolathiri]] Raja of Cannanore who, eager for a Portuguese alliance, offered to sell the Portuguese spices on credit. Cabral accepted the cargo but paid him nonetheless. Even though the cargo turned out to only be low-quality ginger, Cabral was appreciative of the gesture. \n\nHis ships now filled with spices, Cabral decided not to visit Quilon, as he had earlier promised, but to make way back home to Portugal instead.\n\n== Diogo Dias's misadventures ==\n{{Unreferenced-section|date=April 2020}}\nWhile Cabral's main fleet was in India, Diogo Dias, captain of the missing seventh ship of the armada, was going through his own set of adventures. \n\n[[File:Detail of Diogo Dias's ship (Cabral Armada).jpg|thumb|180px|Ship of [[Diogo Dias]], detail from the ''Mem\u00f3ria das Armadas'']]\n\nShortly after being separated from the main fleet at the Cape in June 1500, Dias had struck out too far east into the Indian Ocean and sighted the western coast of the island of [[Madagascar]].  Although the island was not unknown (its Arab name, \"island of the Moon\", was already reported by [[Pero de Covilha]]), Dias was the first Portuguese captain to have sighted it and is often credited with renaming it the island of ''S\u00e3o Louren\u00e7o'', on account of it being found on [[St. Lawrence]]'s day (August 10, 1500).  However, a proper landing on Madagascar would not be undertaken until 1506 and it would only be extensively explored in 1508. \n\nLikely thinking that he was on a South African island, Dias tried to find the African coast by sailing straight north from Madagascar, hoping to reconnect with Cabral's armada there, or to make it to Sofala, Dias's official destination. But he had struck too far east and was in fact in open ocean.  Dias sighted the African coast only around [[Mogadishu]] (''Magadoxo''), by which point Cabral had already crossed the Indian Ocean. The change in the monsoon winds prevented Dias from undertaking his own crossing. Dias pushed up the coast, unexpectedly passing [[Cape Guardafui]] into the [[Gulf of Aden]], waters previously unexplored by Portuguese ships.  Dias spent the next few months in the area. He was trapped by contrary winds, battered by tempests, attacked by Arab pirates, and forced aground on the Eritrean coast, unable to find food and water.\n\nEventually, in late 1500 and early 1501, Dias managed to procure supplies, repair his ship, and catch a favorable wind to take him out of the gulf. With his remaining six crewmen, Dias set sail back to Portugal, hoping to catch Cabral's armada on the return journey.\n\n== Return journey ==\n{{Unreferenced-section|date=April 2020}}\nLate January, 1501 \u2013 Cabral takes aboard an ambassador from Cannanore, and starts his ocean crossing back to East Africa.  On the way, the Portuguese capture a  Gujarati ship, replete with a magnificent cargo.  They steal the cargo, but spare the crew, once they realize they are not Arabs.\n\nFebruary, 1501 \u2013 As Cabral's expedition approaches [[Malindi]], vice-admiral [[Sancho de Tovar]], sailing at the front, runs his spice-laden ship, the ''El Rei'', aground on the Malindi coast.  Irreparable, the great ship is burnt (to recover the iron fittings) and the crews and the cargo reallocated.  Cabral's armada is now reduced to five ships. Cabral authorizes the king of Malindi to recover the cannons from the ''El Rei'' wreck and keep them for himself.\n\nSpring, 1501 \u2013 Cabral's fleet reaches [[Mozambique Island]].  As there is no sign or news from [[Diogo Dias]] awaiting him, Cabral realizes he must take responsibility for the Sofala mission himself.  Cabral orders the private ship ''Anunciada'' of Nuno Leit\u00e3o da Cunha, the fastest in the fleet, to be placed under the command of veteran hand [[Nicolau Coelho]], and dispatched ahead of the rest of the fleet and deliver the results of the voyage to Portugal.  Vice-admiral [[Sancho de Tovar]] (who had lost the ''El-Rei'') is given the chance to make amends by taking command of the caravel ''S\u00e3o Pedro'' (hitherto commanded by [[P\u00earo de Ata\u00edde]]) and seek out Sofala and to proceed home alone from there.  Ata\u00edde is transferred to the command of Coelho's old nau.\n\nIn the meantime, Cabral lands a ''[[degredado]]'' Ant\u00f3nio Fernandes on the African coast, with letters of instruction for Diogo Dias and any passing Portuguese expeditions, informing them of the dramatic turn of events in India, and warning them to avoid Calicut.\n\n[It is uncertain exactly where Cabral left Ant\u00f3nio Fernandes or where he was ordered to go.  According to Ata\u00edde, Fernandes was ordered to go to Mombassa (odd, as Mombassa was then on hostile terms with the Portuguese); others suggest he was supposed to go to Kilwa (which is where the 3rd Armada of [[Jo\u00e3o da Nova]] will find him). Others have speculated that Fernandes was left in Kilwa on the outward leg, and that Cabral's letters were dispatched to him by a local messenger from Mozambique on the return.  Another possibility is that Fernandes was instructed to make his way to Sofala overland, meet Tovar's ship there, and then proceed to explore inland from there to locate [[Monomatapa]] (but then why give him the letters?).  Finally, some conjecture Fernandes is being confused with another degredado, Jo\u00e3o Machado, who had been left in Malindi on the first leg, that he was picked up on the return, and now sent back once again with the letters.]\n\nMarch\u2013April, 1501 \u2013 Matters settled, Cabral takes the remaining three ships\u2014his own flagship, the large nau of Sim\u00e3o de Miranda and Coelho's ship (now under [[P\u00earo de Ata\u00edde]])\u2014and sets sail out of Mozambique island.\n\nAta\u00edde gets separated from the other two in the [[Mozambique Channel]] soon after departure. He hurries to S\u00e3o Br\u00e1s ([[Mossel Bay]], South Africa), hoping to find Cabral there waiting for him.  But he is out of luck\u2014Cabral and Miranda had decided to proceed on together towards Lisbon without him.  Not finding any trace of the others, Ata\u00edde decides to make his way home on his own, leaving behind a letter in a boot by a local watering hole giving an account of the expedition (Ataide's note will be found later that year by [[Jo\u00e3o da Nova]]'s [[3rd Portuguese India Armada (Nova, 1501)|3rd Armada]]).\n\nIn the meantime, Sancho de Tovar, aboard the ''S\u00e3o Pedro'', finally sights [[Sofala]], the entrepot of Monomatapa gold.  He doesn't go ashore, and instead contents himself with scouting the city from his ship, and then sets sail back home alone.\n\n=== Conference at Bezeguiche ===\n\nJune 2, 1501 \u2013 Following up on the discovery of Brazil the previous year, King [[Manuel I of Portugal]] had assembled a small exploratory expedition of three caravels under an unnamed Portuguese captain, and carrying the [[Republic of Florence|Florentine]] cosmographer [[Amerigo Vespucci]] aboard, to explore and map the coast of Brazil.  The exact identity of the captain is uncertain - some speculate it to be [[Gaspar de Lemos]] or [[Andr\u00e9 Gon\u00e7alves (explorer)|Andr\u00e9 Gon\u00e7alves]], whichever of the two had commanded the supply vessel that had delivered the news in June 1500; others conjecture Lemos/Gon\u00e7alves went merely as passengers, and that the expedition itself was commanded by [[Gon\u00e7alo Coelho]].<ref>[[Amerigo Vespucci]] wrote two detailed accounts of this Brazilian mapping expedition - in ''Mundus Novus'' (pub. 1502/03) and as the \"third voyage\" in ''Lettera a Soderini'' (pub.1504/05) - but does not identify the Portuguese captain by name in either.  Chronicler [[Gaspar Correia]], writing a half-century later, identifies the mapping captain as the same captain who steered the returning supply ship - ergo the Lemos/Gon\u00e7alves identification.  Greenlee (1945) suggests the captain was [[Fern\u00e3o de Loronha]], although this has been dismissed by others (e.g. Roukema, 1963).  More recently, historians have drawn attention to a nautical chart by [[Vesconte de Maggiolo]], which identifies the Brazilian landmass with the label ''Tera de Gonsalvo Coigo Vocatur Santa Cruz'' (translated as \"Land of [[Gon\u00e7alo Coelho]] called Santa Cruz\").  [[Gon\u00e7alo Coelho]] is known to have led a later expedition to Brazil (which set out in 1503), but it is commonly estimated that Coelho was still out at sea when Maggiolo composed his chart (c. 1504-05), thereby suggesting Coelho might have also captained the previous 1501 mapping expedition as well. (Morison, 1974, vol. 2, p.281)</ref> Setting out from Lisbon in May 1501, the little Brazilian mapping expedition made a watering stop in early June at ''Bezeguiche'' (as the bay of [[Dakar]] (Senegal) was known to the Portuguese sailors of the time) and stumbles upon  [[Diogo Dias]] cooling his heels there. Dias relates to the Portuguese captain and Vespucci the tales of his misadventures\u2014how he had been separated from Cabral at the Cape, how he had ventured up to the Gulf of Aden, and, finding no trace of Cabral on his return, decided to wait for him in Bezeguiche. Just two days later, the lead ship of the returning India fleet\u2014the ''Anunciada'' under [[Nicolau Coelho]]\u2014sails into Bezeguiche, surprised to find both Dias and the Brazilian mapping expedition there (apparently  Bezeguiche must have been a pre-arranged point of encounter for the Second Armada).\n\nFor the next two weeks, the captains and crews of the different ships exchange tales of their travels and adventures.  It has been since speculated that it was during this time that Amerigo Vespucci came up with his \"[[New World]]\" hypothesis.  After all, Vespucci was quite familiar with the Americas, having participated in [[Alonso de Ojeda|Ojeda]]'s 1499 expedition to the coasts of South America, and it is said he had intense discussions at Bezeguiche with [[Gaspar da Gama]], the Goese Jew aboard Coelho's ship, undoubtedly the person most familiar with the East Indies. Comparing notes, it probably dawned on Vespucci that it was simply impossible to square what he knew of the Americas with what the men of the 2nd Armada knew of Asia.  While still at Bezeguiche, Vespucci wrote a letter to [[Lorenzo de' Medici (1463\u20131503)|Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de' Medici]], relating his encounter, which he sends back with some Florentine passengers on the ''Anunciada''.<ref>Vespucci's 1501 letter is reproduced in Varnhagen (1865).   An English translation can be found in W.H.Greenlee (1938: p.152ff).</ref>  This was a prelude to an even more famous letter of Vespucci to Lorenzo in 1503, shortly after his return, where he finally asserts that the Brazilian landmass was in fact a continent, that the lands discovered to the west were definitely not part of Asia, but must be an entirely different continent, a \"[[New World]]\".<ref>Vespucci (1503). After leaving Bezeguiche, the mapping expedition would make landfall at [[Cape S\u00e3o Roque]] in August 1501, and proceeded to sail south along the Brazilian coast, possibly as far as the [[S\u00e3o Paulo (state)|S\u00e3o Paulo]] coast. They returned to Lisbon before September 1502, perhaps as early as June. A second mapping expedition, this time more certainly under [[Gon\u00e7alo Coelho]], also accompanied by Vespucci (his \"fourth voyage\"), set out for Brazil in April, 1503.</ref>\n\nMid-June, 1501 \u2013 Lemos & Vespucci leave Bezeguiche for Brazil. Shortly after, the pair [[Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral]] and Sim\u00e3o de Miranda themselves reach Bezeguiche, where they find Diogo Dias and Nicolau Coelho awaiting them. Cabral sends Coelho's swift ''Anunciada'' ahead to Lisbon to announce their return, while the remainder rest and wait in Bezeguiche for the remaining two ships.  [[P\u00earo de Ata\u00edde]]'s ship (making his way alone from Mossel Bay) and [[Sancho de Tovar]]'s ''S\u00e3o Pedro'' (returning from Sofala) arrive in Bezeguiche by the end of June.\n\nJune 23, 1501 \u2013 The ''Anunciada'', commanded by [[Nicolau Coelho]], arrives in Lisbon and anchors in [[Bel\u00e9m]].  (Just as in case of Vasco da Gama's expedition, it turns out Nicolau Coelho is once again the first to deliver the news!)  The merchants of the consortium led by [[Bartolomeo Marchionni]] (who own the ''Anunciada'') are delighted.  Letters are immediately fired off throughout Europe announcing the results.\n\nThe news arrives too late for [[Jo\u00e3o da Nova]]'s [[3rd Portuguese India Armada (Nova, 1501)|3rd India Armada]], which departed for India in April.  But Nova will collect the necessary information along the way\u2014from the note in Ata\u00edde's shoe in Mossel Bay, and from Cabral's letters in the possession of Ant\u00f3nio Fernandes in Kilwa.\n\nJuly 21, 1501 \u2013 One month after Coelho's arrival, Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral and Sim\u00e3o de Miranda, the two larger ships, finally arrive in Lisbon. The other three ships arrive a few days later: Sancho de Tovar and P\u00earo de Ata\u00edde on July 25 and the hapless Diogo Dias, with his empty caravel, on July 27.\n\n== Aftermath ==\n{{Refimprove-section|date=April 2020}}\n[[File:Bernardelli - Monumento a Cabral.jpg|thumb|180px|Monument to [[Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral]] in Lisbon, copy of a Brazilian monument by Rodolpho Bernardelli]]\nOn the surface, Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral's 2nd Armada had been a failure and the reaction was conspicuously muted.\n\nShip losses were very heavy. Of the thirteen ships sent out, only five returned with cargo (four crown, one private), five were lost at sea, three returned without cargo (Gaspar de Lemos, Lu\u00eds Pires and Diogo Dias).\n\nHuman losses were even more disheartening.  This included all the crews and captains of the four ships lost at the Cape (notably, the celebrated discoverer Bartolomeu Dias).  Another fifty-something Portuguese (including the factor Aires Correia) had been killed in the Calicut massacre.\n\nThen there were the mission failures.  Relative to the instructions given to him in Lisbon, Cabral had failed on nearly every count:\n*1. failed to establish a treaty with the Zamorin of Calicut\u2014indeed, Calicut was now more hostile than ever.\n*2. failed to establish a factory at Calicut (massacred);\n*3. failed to bring the 'Hindu Church' in line (the friars that survived reported the Hindus weren't Christians after all, just 'idolaters');\n*4. failed to make a treaty with Kilwa;\n*5. failed to establish a factory at Sofala (seen from afar by Tovar, but that is all).\n\nOn the other hand, in his defense, Cabral could point to some positive achievements.\n\n*1. opening of friendly relations with Cochin, Canannore and Quilon;\n*2. a factory in Cochin, poorer than Calicut perhaps, but workable;\n*3. discovery of true Christian communities in Cranganore, etc.;\n*4. Sofala was at least discovered and scouted;\n*5. discovery of Brazil, which might serve as a useful staging post for future India runs;\n*6. Diogo Dias's discovery of Madagascar and exploration of the African coast up to Cape Guardafui and the Gulf of Aden was useful information.\n*7. Finally, Cabral did bring back tons of spices, which were off-loaded into the Lisbon warehouses and sold at no small profit for the crown treasury.\n\nHowever, it was the ship and human losses that weighed heavily against Cabral being honored or rewarded. Allegations of 'incompetence' flew easily in the circles that mattered. Although Cabral was initially offered the command of the [[4th Portuguese India Armada (Gama, 1502)|4th Armada]], scheduled for 1502, it seemed more like a ''pro forma'' gesture than a sincere offer.<ref>Subrahmanyam (1997: p.191)</ref> The crown made it clear that Cabral's command would be limited and supervised \u2013 conditions humiliating enough to force Cabral to withdraw his name.  The 4th Armada would be placed under the command of Vasco da Gama.\n\nAlthough the reaction of Portuguese court opinion in 1501, on Cabral's return, was generally low, it ascended retrospectively.  Cabral's discovery of Brazil, initially received as a minor discovery of little interest, turned out to be much more momentous.  The follow-up Brazilian mapping expeditions of 1501-02 and 1503-04, under the captaincy of [[Gon\u00e7alo Coelho]], carrying the Florentine cosmographer [[Amerigo Vespucci]], revealed a massive continent - which Vespucci famously labelled a \"[[New World]]\" (''Mundus Novus'').  The plentitude of [[brazilwood]] (''pau-brasil'') discovered by the mapping expeditions on its shores lured the interest of European cloth industry, and led to the 1505 contract granted to [[Fern\u00e3o de Loronha]] for the commercial exploitation of Brazil. The lucrative brazilwood trade eventually drew competition from French and Spanish interlopers, forcing the Portuguese government to take a more active interest in Cabral's \"[[Name of Brazil|Land of Vera Cruz]]\", finally leading to the establishment of the first Portuguese colonies in [[Colonial Brazil]] in 1532.\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Carta de P\u00earo Vaz de Caminha]]\n* [[Portuguese India Armadas]]\n* [[Portuguese India]]\n* [[Alternative theory of the European discovery of Brazil]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|group=note |30em}}\n\n== References == \n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Sources ==\n'''Eyewitness Accounts'''\n\n* [Anonymous Pilot] \"Navigationi del Capitano Pedro Alvares Cabral Scrita per un Piloto Portoghese et Tradotta di Lingua Portoghese in Italiana\", first published in Francanzano Montalbado, 1507, editor, ''Paesi novamente retrovati et Novo Mondo da Alberico Vesputio Florentino intitulato'', Vicenza.

Cabral's armada famously discovered [[Brazil]] for the Portuguese crown along the way. By and large, the Second Armada's diplomatic mission to [[India]] failed, and provoked the opening of hostilities between the [[Kingdom of Portugal]] and the feudal city-state of [[Kozhikode|Calicut]].  Nonetheless, it managed to establish a factory in the nearby [[Kingdom of Cochin]], the first Portuguese [[Factory (trading post)|factory]] in Asia.\n\n== Fleet ==\n\nThe [[1st Portuguese India Armada (Gama, 1497)|first India Armada]], commanded by [[Vasco da Gama]], arrived in Portugal in the summer of 1499, in rather sorry shape. Half of his ships and men had been lost thanks to battles, disease, and storms. Although Gama came back with a hefty cargo of spices that would be sold at enormous profit, he had failed in the principal objective of his mission: to negotiate a treaty with [[Kozhikode|Calicut]], the spice entrep\u00f4t on the [[Malabar Coast]] of India. Gama managed, however, to open the sea route to India via the [[Cape of Good Hope]] and secured good relations with the African city-state of [[Malindi]], a critical staging post along the way.\n\nOn King Manuel I's orders, arrangements were immediately made to begin the assembly of a second armada in [[Cascais]].  Determined not to repeat Gama's mistakes, this one was to be a large and well-armed fleet of 13 ships and 1500 men, laden with valuable gifts and diplomatic letters to win over the potentates of the east.\n\nMany details of the composition of the fleet are missing. Only three ship names are known, and there is some conflict among the sources on the captains.

Gaspar Correia identifies Sim\u00e3o de Miranda as the predesignated successor instead.</ref>\n\nVeteran pilot [[Pedro Escobar]] was given the overall technical command of the expedition. Other veterans of the first armada included captain Nicolau Coelho, pilot [[P\u00earo de Alenquer]], and clerks Afonso Lopes and [[Jo\u00e3o de S\u00e1]].  The famed navigator Bartolomeu Dias, who was the first to double the Cape of Good Hope, and his brother Diogo Dias, who had served as clerk on Gama's ship, also served as captains. \n\nMost of the ships were either [[carracks]] (''naus'') or [[caravels]], and at least one was a small supply ship, although details on names and tonnage are missing.<ref group=note>Castanheda (1551) claims there were ten carracks and three caravels. The Anonymous Pilot refers to only twelve ships, plus a supply ship.</ref>  At least two ships, Cabral's flagship and Tovar's ''El Rei'', were said to be around 240 tons, that is, about twice the size of the largest ship in the first armada three years prior.\n\nTen ships were destined for [[Kozhikode|Calicut]] (Malabar, India), while the two ships headed by the Dias brothers were destined for [[Sofala]] in East Africa and the supply ship was destined to be scuttled and burnt along the way.<ref group=note>The Sofala destination of the Dias brothers is found in Castanheda (1551). It is confirmed in the Anonymous Pilot.</ref>\n\n[[File:Cabral armada of 1500 (Livro das Armadas).jpg|thumb|250px|left|Fleet of the 2nd India Armada (Cabral, 1500), from the ''Mem\u00f3ria das Armadas'']]\n\nAt least two ships were privately owned and outfitted: Lu\u00eds Pires's ship was owned by Diogo da Silva e Meneses, [[Count of Portalegre]], while Nuno Leit\u00e3o da Cunha's ''Anunciada'' was owned by the king's cousin D. [[\u00c1lvaro of Braganza]], and financed by an Italian consortium composed of the Florentine bankers [[Bartolomeo Marchionni]] and [[Girolamo Sernigi]] and the Genoese Antonio Salvago. The remainder belonged to the Portuguese crown.\n\nAccompanying the expedition as translator was [[Gaspar da Gama]], who was a Jew captured in Angediva by Vasco Gama, as well as four Hindu hostages from Calicut taken by Gama in 1498 during negotiations. Also aboard was the ambassador of the Sultan of Malindi, who had arrived at Portugal with Gama, and was set to return to Malindi with Cabral's expedition.\n\nOther passengers on the expedition included Aires Correia, the designated [[Factor (agent)|factor]] for Calicut, his secretary P\u00earo Vaz de Caminha, Afonso Furtado, the designated factor for Sofala, and clerk Martinho Neto.  Accompanying them on the trip was the royal physician and amateur astronomer, Master [[Jo\u00e3o Faras]], who brought along the latest astrolabe and new Arabic astronomical staves for navigational experiments.  One chronicler suggests that the knight [[Duarte Pacheco Pereira]] was also aboard.<ref group=note>[[Dami\u00e3o de G\u00f3is]] is the chronicler responsible for this claim.  This is not substantiated elsewhere.  Greenlee (1938, p. li) and Diffie and Winius (1977, p. 188fn) dismiss the possibility.</ref>\n\nThe fleet carried some twenty Portuguese ''[[degredado|degredados]]'', who were criminal convicts who could fulfill their sentences by being abandoned along the shores of various places and exploring inland on the crown's behalf. Four of the degredados are known: Afonso Ribeiro, Jo\u00e3o Machado, Luiz de Moura, and Antonio Fernandes, who was also a ship carpenter. \n\nFinally, the fleet carried eight [[Franciscan]] friars and eight chaplains, under the supervision of the head chaplain, Fr. Henrique Soares of Coimbra. They were the first Portuguese Christian missionaries to India.\n\nThere are three surviving eyewitness accounts of this expedition: (1) an extended letter written by P\u00earo Vaz de Caminha (possibly dictated by Aires Correia), written from Brazil on May 1, 1500, to King Manuel I; (2) the brief letter by Mestre [[Jo\u00e3o Faras]] to the king, also from Brazil; and (3) the account of an anonymous Portuguese pilot, first published in Italian in 1507 (commonly referred to as the ''Rela\u00e7\u00e3o do Piloto An\u00f4nimo'', sometimes believed to be the clerk [[Jo\u00e3o de S\u00e1]]).\n\n== Mission ==\n\nThe priority of the mission was to secure a treaty with [[Zamorin]]'s [[Kozhikode|Calicut]] (''Calecute'', Kozhikode), the principal commercial entrep\u00f4t of the [[Kerala]] spice trade and dominant feudal city-state on the [[Malabar coast]] of [[India]]. [[Vasco da Gama]]'s first armada had visited Calicut in 1498, but had failed to impress the elderly ruling Manivikraman Raja ('Samoothiri Raja'), the [[Zamorin of Calicut]]. As such, no agreements had been signed. Cabral's instructions were to succeed where Gama had failed, and to this end was entrusted with magnificent gifts to present to the Zamorin. Cabral was under orders to establish a ''feitoria'' ([[Factory (trading post)|factory]]) in Calicut, which would be placed under Aires Correia.\n\nThe second priority, assigned to Bartolomeu and Diogo Dias, was to search out the East African port of [[Sofala]], near the mouth of the [[Zambezi]] river.<ref>Anonymous Pilot, p. 107</ref> Sofala had been secretly visited and described by the explorer [[P\u00earo da Covilh\u00e3]] during his overland expedition a decade earlier (c. 1487), and he identified it as the endpoint of the [[Monomatapa]] gold trade.  The Portuguese crown was eager to tap into that gold source, but Gama's armada had failed to find it.  The Dias brothers were instructed to find and establish a factory at Sofala under designated factor Afonso Furtado.  To this end, the brothers were likely also instructed to secure the consent of [[Kilwa Sultanate|Kilwa]] (''Qu\u00edloa''), the dominant city-state of the East African coast and putative overlord of Sofala.  \n\nA minor objective included the delivery of a group of [[Franciscan]] missionaries to India. It is said that Vasco da Gama had misinterpreted the [[Hinduism]] he saw practiced in India as a form of \"primitive\" Christianity.  He believed its peculiar characteristics were a result of centuries of separation from the mainstream church in Europe. As such, Gama recommended that missionaries be sent to India to help bring the practices of the \"Hindu church\" up to date with Roman Catholic orthodoxy.  To this end, a group of Franciscan friars, led by Fr. Henrique Soares of Coimbra, joined the expedition.\n\nAs a final objective, the Second Armada was also a commercial spice run. The crown and private merchants who had outfitted the ships expected full cargoes of spices to return to Lisbon. \n\n=== Suspected Brazilian mission ===\n\nThere has been some debate over whether Cabral also had secret instructions from the king to lay claim to the landmass of Brazil\u2014or, more precisely, to swing as far west as possible to the [[Treaty of Tordesillas|Tordesillas line]] and claim whatever lands or islands might be discovered there for the Portuguese crown, before the Spanish did.<ref>{{cite book|last=Peres |first=Dami\u00e3o |date=1949 |title=O descobrimento do Brasil por Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral: antecedentes e intencionalidade |language=Portuguese}}</ref> Among the pieces of evidence is an indication of an island in the area in a 1448 map of [[Andrea Bianco]], apparently alluded to in the letter of Master Jo\u00e3o Faras; there is also the suggestion by [[Duarte Pacheco Pereira]] in his ''Esmeraldo de Situ Orbis'' that he had been sent on an expedition to a western landmass in 1498.<ref>{{cite book|last=Pacheco Pereira |first=Duarte |date=c. 1505 |title=Esmeraldo de Situ Orbis |url=https://archive.org/details/esmeraldodesitu00peregoog/page/n62/mode/2up |chapter=Cap 2: Da cantidade & grandeza da terra, & daugua qual destas he a mayor parte. |language=Portuguese}}</ref> That is about the full extent of the evidence of intentionality and this claim is largely speculative.<ref>{{cite book|last=Greenlee |first=William Brooks |date=1938 |pages=l\u2013lv |title=The Voyage of Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral to Brazil and India: from contemporary documents and narratives |publisher=Routledge |isbn=1409414485}}</ref> There are various reasons to presume the existence of such instructions unlikely.\n\nSpanish explorers had certainly been tending south at that time. Christopher Columbus]had touched the coast of the South American mainland around [[Guyana]] in 1498 on his [[Voyages of Christopher Columbus#Third voyage|third trip]]. In late 1499, [[Alonso de Ojeda]] had discovered much of the [[Venezuela|Venezuelan]] coast and in early 1500, [[Vicente Y\u00e1\u00f1ez Pinz\u00f3n]] and [[Diego de Lepe]], via generous southerly swings from the [[Canary islands]], had reached at least what is now [[Cear\u00e1]], and perhaps went as far east as [[Cabo de Santo Agostinho|Cape of Santo Agostinho]] in [[Pernambuco]]. They had explored much of the northern Brazilian coast west of it. It is possible that the southerly Spanish tendencies were deliberate, aimed at securing more land for the Spanish crown.<ref group=note>Although the person from whom the Spanish crown was trying to claim land was not the king of Portugal, as that was already mediated by Tordesillas, but Christopher Columbus, their own vice-roy of the Indies. Ojeda, Pinz\u00f3n, and Lepe were all dispatched on separate royal capitulations by [[Juan Rodr\u00edguez de Fonseca|Bishop Fonseca]], an enemy of Columbus, with the deliberate intent of finding and claiming lands ''outside'' (i.e., to the south) of the Columbus-owned West Indian islands, thereby circumscribing Columbus's viceroyalty and limiting him to the islands he already had. This would figure in later lawsuits by the Columbus family.</ref>\n\nThese expeditions, however, were too recent for their results to have been known in Lisbon before Cabral's departure in March 1500; indeed, they were unknown in Spain itself. It is very doubtful that the Portuguese were aware of them. Even if they were, it would not seem sensible for Cabral's Second Armada to be instructed to deviate from its original mission in India to pursue exploratory work which be far more efficiently accomplished by smaller caravels. \n\n== Outward journey ==\n\n[[File:Cabral armada of 1500 (Livro de Lisuarte de Abreu).jpg|thumb|350px|Fleet of the 2nd India Armada (Cabral, 1500), from the ''Livro de Lisuarte de Abreu'']]\nOn March 9, Cabral's expedition set out from the [[Tagus]]. Thirteen days later, on March 22, Cabral's armada reached the island of [[S\u00e3o Nicolau, Cape Verde|S\u00e3o Nicolau]] in the middle of a storm.  The privately outfitted ship of Lu\u00eds Pires was too damaged by the tempest to continue, and returned to Lisbon<ref>According to Barros (1552, II.5.2 [https://books.google.com/books?id=Epo2AAAAMAAJ&dq=editions%3AUOM39015057112644&lr&as_brr=1&pg=PA386#v=onepage&q&f=false p.386]); also Castanheda (1551), G\u00f3is (1566).</ref><ref group=note>Caminha's eyewitness account made no mention of Pires and instead reported that it was the Vasco de Ataide's crown ship that was lost around Cape Verde.</ref>\n\nFrom Cape Verde, Cabral went southwest. It is unknown why he chose such an unusual direction, but the most probable hypothesis is that he was simply following the wide arc in the South Atlantic to catch a favorable wind to carry them to the Cape of Good Hope. Navigationally, the arc is sensible. From Cape Verde, the ship would cut across the [[doldrums]] below the equator, catch the southwest-bound [[South Equatorial Current|equatorial drift]], and turn into the southbound [[Brazil Current]] that will carry them down to the [[horse latitudes]] (30\u00b0S), where the prevailing [[westerlies]] begin.  The westerlies would easily carry the ships across the South Atlantic around the Cape of Good Hope. If instead of this arc, Cabral attempted to strike southeast from Cape Verde, it would go into the [[Gulf of Guinea]]. To reach the Cape from there would be a struggle, as Cabral would have had to sail against the southeasterly [[trade wind|trade winds]], as well as the [[Benguela Current]]. \n\nHow Cabral knew of this arc is unknown. Most likely, this was precisely the route followed by Gama on his first trip in 1497. The veterans of the first fleet\u2014notably the pilots Alenquer and Escobar\u2014would very likely have charted the same route for Cabral again.<ref group=note>That this arc was sailed by Gama in 1497 is uncertain, but most modern historians have come to accept that he did. How did Gama know about the arc when no one had yet sailed it before? Some have speculated that the Portuguese crown might have dispatched secret exploratory expeditions to those waters in advance. The more widely accepted hypothesis, first forwarded by admiral [[Gago Coutinho]], is more straightforward: Since Bartolomeu Dias's 1488 expedition discovered the westerlies, the South Atlantic arc became \"navigationally obvious\" to any sensible pilot, especially pilots as experienced as Alenquer and Escobar. See Gago Coutinho (1951\u201352) ''A Nautica dos Descobrimentos: os descobrimentos maritimos visitos por um navegador'', 2 vols., Lisbon: Agencia Geral do Ultramar.</ref> Indeed, in the Lisbon archives, there is a draft of a document intended for Cabral that instructs him to strike in a southwesterly direction when he reaches the doldrums.<ref>After Cape Verde, where the wind is weak ('vento escasso') the ships should strike in the open ocean arc ('ir na volta do mar'), until the Cape of Good Hope, as this is the shorter route ('a navega\u00e7\u00e3o ser\u00e1 mais breve'). See Fonseca (1908, p. 211; see also p.224) [https://books.google.com/books?id=A7lI4gqh7PsC&pg=PA208#v=onepage&q&f=false copy of letter]; see also Greenlee (1938, p. 167)</ref> \n\nAlternative hypotheses forwarded for Cabral striking southwest are that he was trying to reach the [[Azores]] to repair his storm-battered fleet, that he was searching for and rounding up missing tempest-tossed ships, or that it was an intentional attempt to discover if there was any land by the Tordesillas line.\n\n=== Discovery of Brazil ===\n\nCabral took the same path as Gama had, but made a slightly wider arc and went further west than Gama had. As a result, he hit upon the hitherto unknown landmass of Brazil. After nearly 30 days of sailing (44 since departure), on April 21, Cabral's fleet found the first indications of nearby land.<ref>{{cite book|last=Fonseca |first=Faustino da |date=1908 |page=225 |title=A Descoberta to Brasil |language=Portuguese |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A7lI4gqh7PsC&pg=PA208#v=onepage&q&f=false |publisher=Livraria Central de Gomes de Carvalho |place=Lisbon}}</ref> The next day, the armada caught sight of the Brazilian coast, seeing the outlines of a hill they named [[Monte Pascoal]].\n\nThe armada anchored at the mouth of the [[Do Frade River|Frade river]] the next day, and a group of local [[Tupiniquim]] Indians assembled on the beach. Cabral dispatched a small party, headed by Nicolau Coelho, in a longboat ashore to make first contact. Coelho tossed his hat in exchange for a feathered headdress, but the surf was too strong for a proper landing and opening of communication, so they returned to the ships.<ref>{{cite book|last=Fonseca |first=Faustino da |date=1908 |pages=241\u2013242 |title=A Descoberta to Brasil |language=Portuguese |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A7lI4gqh7PsC&pg=PA208#v=onepage&q&f=false |publisher=Livraria Central de Gomes de Carvalho |place=Lisbon}}</ref>\n\nStrong overnight winds prompted the armada to lift anchor and sail some 10 leagues (45&nbsp;km) north, finding harbor behind the reef at Cabr\u00e1lia Bay, just north of [[Porto Seguro]].  The pilot Afonso Lopes, while [[Sounding line|sounding]] in a rowboat, spotted a native canoe, captured the two Indians on board, and brought them back to ship. The language barrier prevented questioning, but they were fed and given cloth and beads. The cultural difference was apparent: The natives spat out their honey and cake and were deeply surprised upon seeing a chicken.<ref>Guia politicamente incorreto da Hist\u00f3ria do Brasil, Leandro Narloch</ref>\n\nThe next day, on April 25, a party led by Coelho and Bartolomeu Dias went ashore, accompanied by the two natives. Armed Tupiniquim warily approached the beach, but upon a signal from the two natives, set down their bows, and allowed the Portuguese to land and collect water.\n\n[[File:Meirelles-primeiramissa2.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''The First Mass in Brazil'' by [[Victor Meirelles]] (1861)]]\n\nOn April 26, the Octave of Easter Sunday, the Franciscan friar Henrique Soares of Coimbra went ashore to celebrate mass in front of 200 Tupiniquim Indians.  This is the first known Christian mass on the American mainland.\n\nInteraction between the Portuguese and the Tupiniquim gradually increased throughout the week.  European iron nails, cloth, beads, and crucifixes were traded for American amulets, spears, parrots, and monkeys. There was only the slightest hint that precious metals might be found in the hinterlands. Portuguese ''degredados'' are assigned to spend the night in Tupiniquim villages, while the rest of the crew sleeps aboard ships.\n\n[[File:Carta-caminha.png|thumb|150px|Facsimile of P\u00earo Vaz de Caminha's letter to the king, reporting the discovery of the \"Island of the True Cross\" (Brazil)]]\n\nOn May 1, Cabral makes preparations to resume the journey to India. The Portuguese pilots, assisted by the physician-astronomer Master Jo\u00e3o Faras, determined that Brazil lay east of the Tordesillas line, prompting Cabral to formally claim it for the Portuguese crown, bestowing upon it the name of ''Ilha de Vera Cruz'' (\"Island  of the True Cross\"). It was later renamed ''Terra de Santa Cruz''\u2014\"Land of the Holy Cross\"\u2014upon the realization that it was not an island).<ref group=note>Gaspar Correia ([https://books.google.com/books?id=YmVKAAAAYAAJ&dq=editions%3ALCCN05022145&as_brr=1&pg=PA152#v=onepage&q&f=false p.152]) and Jo\u00e3o de Barros ([https://books.google.com/books?id=Epo2AAAAMAAJ&dq=editions%3AUOM39015057112644&lr&as_brr=1&pg=PA391#v=onepage&q&f=false p.391]) say it was named \"Santa Cruz\" from the start, with Correia saying it was named so because the departure date was the [[Feast of the Cross]] on the liturgical calendar. However, both Caminha's and Mestre Jo\u00e3o's letters are signed as written from \"Vera Cruz\" on May 1.</ref>\n\nOn May 2, Cabral dispatched the supply ship back to [[Lisbon]], with the Brazilian items and a letter to King Manuel I composed by the secretary P\u00earo Vaz de Caminha to announce the discovery.<ref>Anonymous Pilot [https://books.google.com/books?id=eCsOAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA110#v=onepage&q&f=false p.110]</ref> It also carried a separate private letter to the king from Master [[Jo\u00e3o Faras]], in which he identified the main guiding constellation in the southern hemisphere, the [[Southern Cross]] (''Cruzeiro'').<ref>Some sources claim that the ''Cruzeiro'' constellation had already been identified by [[Alvise Cadamosto]] in the 1450s.</ref> The supply ship arrived in Lisbon in June.\n\nAfter that, with a couple of Portuguese ''degredados'' left beind with the Tupiniquim of Porto Seguro,<ref>Anonymous Pilot [https://books.google.com/books?id=eCsOAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA110#v=onepage&q&f=false p.110]</ref> Cabral ordered the eleven remaining ships to set sail and continue on their route to India.\n\n=== Crossing to India ===\n\nAfter crossing the Atlantic Ocean, Cabral's armada reached the Cape of Good Hope in late May.  The fleet faced headlong winds for six straight days and four ship\u2014Bartolomeu Dias's, Aires Gomes da Silva's, Sim\u00e3o de Pina's, and Vasco de Ata\u00edde's\u2014are lost at sea in the process.<ref>Castanheda (1551)</ref><ref>Barros (1552)</ref><ref>G\u00f3is (1566)</ref><ref group=note>The ''Rela\u00e7ao das Naos'' mistakenly substitutes Sim\u00e3o de Miranda for Sim\u00e3o da Pina in the losses, although this is corrected in the marginal gloss. Gaspar Correia (1550) almost concurs\u2014but as he does not have Aires Gomes da Silva on his original captain list, he identifies the fourth ship lost as Gaspar de Lemos. Similarly, the ''Livro de Lisuarte d'Abreu'' (1563), which has neither Pina nor Gomes da Silva on its list, say it was Diogo de Figueir\u00f3 and Luis Pires who were lost.  Diogo do Couto (c.1600) mistakenly adds P\u00earo d'Ataide to the list, bringing the losses to five. Some scholars also contend that Pires was lost at this point, and Vasco de Ata\u00edde had been lost earlier at Cape Verde.</ref> In this way, the fleet was reduced to seven ships. Facing strong winds, the armada split into smaller groups to meet again on the other side. Cabral's ship went with two others.\n\nOn June 16, 1500, Cabral's three-ship squadron reached the [[Primeiras and Segundas Archipelago|Primeiras Islands]] several leagues north of Sofala.  Two local merchant ships, catching sight of Cabral, took flight. Cabral gave pursuit\u2014one of them runs aground and the other is captured. Upon questioning, it was discovered that these ships were owned by a cousin of the sultan Fateima of Malindi (who had received Vasco da Gama in 1498), so they were released. \n\nThe three ships landed on [[Mozambique Island]] on June 22. Despite the earlier quarrel with his ships, Cabral was given a warm reception by the Sultan of Mozambique and was allowed to collect water and supplies.  Shortly after, three more ships of the Second Armada sailed into the island and joined with Cabral.  Only the ship of Diogo Dias remained missing.  As Dias's mission was for Sofala anyway, Cabral decided not to wait for it and instead pressed on with his fleet of six ships.\n\n[[File:Map of Cabral route, 1500.gif|thumb|340px|Approximate route of outward journey of Cabral's 2nd Armada (also route of stray ship of Diogo Dias)]]\n\nMore than a month later, on July 26, Cabral's armada reached [[Kilwa Kisiwani|Kilwa]], the dominant city-state of the East African coast and which Gama had never visited. Afonso Furtado, who had been appointed factor for Sofala in Lisbon and had escaped death (Furtado had been aboard Bartolomeu Dias's ship, but moved to the flagship just before the Cape crossing), went ashore to open negotiations with the strongman ruler, Emir Ibrahim.<ref group=note>At the time, there was no ruling [[Kilwa Sultanate|Sultan of Kilwa]] as the previous one, al-Fudail, had been deposed in a coup (c. 1495) by his minister, Emir Ibrahim, who had since ruled Kilwa with a vacant throne.</ref>\n\nA meeting was arranged between Cabral and Ibrahim, conducted on a couple of rowboats in the harbor. Cabral presents a letter from King Manuel I proposing a treaty, but Ibrahim was suspicious and remained resistant to the overtures. Cabral, sensing Ibrahim's resistance and worrying that they might miss the monsoon winds to India, broke off the negotiations and sailed on.\n\nPressing north, the Cabral fleet avoided the hostile [[Mombassa]] (''Momba\u00e7a'') and finally reached friendly Malindi (''Melinde'') on August 2.  There, he was well-received by the Sultan of Malindi and dropped off the Malindi ambassador that Gama had taken the previous year.  Leaving behind  two ''degredados'', Lu\u00eds de Moura and Jo\u00e3o Machado, and picking up two Gujarati pilots, Cabral's six-ship armada finally began its Indian Ocean crossing on August 7, 1500.\n\n== Cabral in India ==\n{{Refimprove-section|date=April 2020}}\nAfter an uneventful ocean crossing, Cabral's six ships landed on [[Anjediva Island]] (''Angediva'', Anjadip) on August 22, where they rested and repaired and repainted the ships.\n\nSailing down the Indian coast, Cabral's expedition finally reached [[Kozhikode|Calicut]] on September 13. Gaily decorated native boats came out to greet them, but remembering Gama's experience, Cabral refused to go ashore until hostages were exchanged. He dispatched Afonso Furtado and the four Calicut hostages taken by Gama the previous year to negotiate the details of the landing. When the negotiation was complete, Cabral finally went ashore himself and met the new Zamorin of Calicut. Cabral presents him with much finer and more luxurious gifts than Gama had brought, and more respectful and personalized letters of address from King Manuel I of Portugal.\n\nA commercial treaty was successfully negotiated and the Zamorin gave Cabral a security-of-trade certificate etched on a silver plate. The Portuguese were permitted to establish a ''feitoria]]'' in Calicut. Aires Correia went ashore with around 70 men. Once the factory was set up, Cabral released the ship hostages as a sign of trust and Correia set about buying spices in Calicut's markets for the ships to take home.\n\nSometime in October, the Zamorin of Calicut dispatched a service request to Cabral's idling fleet. Arab merchants allied with the rival city-state of [[Cochin kingdom|Cochin]] were returning from [[Ceylon]] with a cargo of war elephants destined for the Sultan of [[Cambay]]. Claiming it to be illegal contraband, the Zamorin asked Cabral to intercept them. Cabral sent one of his caravels under P\u00earo de Ata\u00edde to capture it.  Hoping for a spectacle, the Zamorin himself came down to the beachfront to witness the engagement, but left in disgust when the Arab ship slipped past Ataide, who gave chase and eventually caught up to it near Cannanore] He successfully seized the vessel and Cabral presented the captured ship, with its nearly intact elephant cargo, to the Zamorin as a gift.\n\n=== Calicut Massacre ===\n\nBy December of 1500, factor Aires Correia was still only able to buy enough spices to load two of the ships. He complained to Cabral his suspicions that the guild of Arab merchants in Calicut had been colluding to shut out Portuguese purchasing agents from the city's spice markets. Arab traders had reportedly used similar tactics to drive out Chinese merchants earlier in the 15th century from various ports on the [[Malabar Coast]]. Correia thought that it would make sense if they repeated this, particularly as the Portuguese had been clear with their hatred of \"the Moors\" and had demanded trading privileges and preferences.<ref group=note>Historians now think that the Portuguese traders may have in fact been unwitting counters in ongoing quarrels between competing older and newer Arab merchant guilds in Calicut. They may also have been used as pawns in the personal power struggles among the Zamorin's leading advisors.</ref>\n\nCabral presented Correia's complaint to the Zamorin, and requested that he crack down on the Arab merchant guild or enforce Portuguese priority in the spice markets. But the Zamorin refused Cabral's demand that he actively intervene in the market. \n\nFrustrated by the Zamorin's inaction, Cabral decided to take matters into his own hands. On December 17, on the advice of Aires Correia, Cabral ordered the seizure of an Arab merchant ship from [[Jeddah]], which had been loaded up with spices. He claimed that the Zamorin had promised the Portuguese priority in the spice markets, and so the cargo was rightfully theirs. Incensed, the Arab merchants around the quay immediately raised a riot in Calicut and direct mobs to attack the Portuguese factory. The Portuguese ships, anchored out in the harbor and unable to approach the docks, could only watch the unfolding massacre. After three hours of fighting, 53 (though some sources say 70) Portuguese were slaughtered by the mobs\u2014including the factor Aires Correia, the secretary Caminha, and three (some say five) of the Franciscan friars.  Around twenty Portuguese in the city managed to escape the riot by jumping into the harbor waters and swimming to the ships. The survivors reported to Cabral that the Zamorin's own guards were seen either standing aside or actively helping the rioters. At least one Portuguese, a man called Gon\u00e7alo Peixoto, was sheltered from the mob by a local merchant (whom the chronicles call \"Coja Bequij\") and survived the massacre. \n\nAfter the Calicut massacre, the wares in the Portuguese factory were impounded by the Calicut authorities.\n\n=== War with Calicut ===\n\nIncensed at the attack on the factory, Cabral waited one day for redress by the Zamorin.  When this did not arrive, Cabral and the Portuguese seized around ten Arab merchant ships then in harbor between December 18 and 22. They confiscated the ships' cargoes, killed the crews, and burned their ships. Then, accusing the Zamorin of sanctioning the riot, Cabral ordered a full day [[shore bombardment]] of Calicut, doing immense damage to the unfortified city. Estimates of Calicut casualties reach up to 600. Cabral proceeded to also bomb the nearby Zamorin-owned port of Pandarane.<ref group=note>The port of Pandarane has since disappeared. Its location is usually identified as 'Pantalyini Kollam', a port that has since been annexed by the growing city of [[Koyilandy]]; it is also sometimes identified with modern [[Kappad]]. (Dames, 1918, p.85)</ref>\n\nThis marked the beginning of the war between the Kingdom of Portugal and the Zamorin of Calicut. The war dragged on for the next decade and became an important focus of future armadas. It ultimately dictated Portuguese strategy in the Indian Ocean and overturned the political order on the Malabar Coast of India.\n\n=== Alliance with Cochin kingdom ===\n\n[[File:Kerala cities at time of Cabral (1500).gif|thumb|250px|India Malabar Coast c. 1500]]\nOn December 24, Cabral left the smoldering Calicut, unsure of what to do next. At the suggestion of Gaspar da Gama, the Goese Jew who had been accompanying the expedition, Cabral set sail south along the coast toward Cochin kingdom (''Cochim'', Kochi or Perumpadappu Swarupam), a small Hindu [[Nair]] city-state at the outlet of the [[Vembanad Lake|Vembanad lagoon]] in the Kerala backwaters. Partly in vassalage to and partly at war with Zamorin's Calicut, Cochin had long chafed at the dominance of its larger neighbor and was looking for an opportunity to break away.\n\nArriving in Cochin, a Portuguese emissary and a [[Saint Thomas Christians|Christian]] picked up in Calicut went ashore to make contact with the Trimumpara Raja (Unni Goda Varma), the Nair Hindu prince of Cochin.<ref group=note>The exact status of the Trimumpara Raja is a bit unclear.  It seems that the formal ruler of Cochin was the king of [[Edapalli]], which was across the lagoon on the mainland, but that the Cochinese peninsula (with capital at [[Perumpadappu (Malappuram district)|Perumpadappu]]) had at some point been detached as an appanage for a son, who, in turn, had detached the northern tip, Cochin proper, for another son. Moreover, it seems that these appanages were not supposed to be permanent fiefs, but rather to serve as temporary \"training grounds\" for princely heirs before they moved up in succession order. In other words, the ruler of Cochin was the second heir of Edapalli. Upon the death of the ruler of Edapalli, the first heir was meant to leave the peninsula and take up his duties in Edapalli, and the second heir would from Cochin to Perumpadappu, and assign Cochin to his own successor (the new second heir). The Portuguese seem to have arrived at a time when the princely heirs were somewhat at odds with one another, for some reason or another. It was only under Portuguese protection that the rulers of Cochin finally became proper kings in their own right.  Thus the Raja Trimumpara's search for a Portuguese alliance possibly had more to do with his own family quarrels than with the exactions of the Zamorin of Calicut.  See Dames (1918: p.86n).</ref> The Portuguese were greeted warmly, with the bombardment of Calicut outweighing the earlier matter of the war elephants. With all the cordialities and hostage-swapping completed quickly, Cabral himself went ashore and negotiated a treaty of alliance between Portugal and Cochin, directed against Zamorin's Calicut. Cabral promised to make the Trimumpara Raja of Cochin the ruler of kingdom of Calicut upon the city's capture.\n\nA Portuguese factory is set up in Cochin, with Gon\u00e7alo Gil Barbosa as chief factor. The spice markets of the smaller Cochin were not nearly as well-supplied as those of Calicut, but the trade was good enough to begin loading ships.  The stay in Cochin was not, however, without incident. The factory was set ablaze one evening, likely at the instigation of Arab traders in the city. The Trimumpara Raja, in contrast with the Zamorin of Calicut, cracked down on the arsonists. He took the Portuguese under his protection by having the factors stay in his palace and assigned his personal Nair guards to escort the factors in the city markets and protect the factory against further incidents.\n\nIn early January of 1501, while in Cochin, Cabral received missives from the rulers of Cannanore (''Canonor'', Kannur or Kolathunad), one of Calicut's reluctant rivals in the north, and [[Quilon]] (''Coul\u00e3o'', Kollam or Venad Swarupam), which was further south and had once been a great Syrian Christian merchant city-state, being an entrep\u00f4t for cinnamon, ginger, and dyewood.  They commended Cabral's actions against Calicut and invited the Portuguese to trade in their cities instead. Not wishing to offend his Cochinese host, Cabral declined the invitations, only promising to visit the cities at some future date.\n\nWhile still in Cochin, Cabral received yet another invitation, this one from the nearby [[Kodungallur Kovilakam|Cranganore kingdom]] (''Cranganor'', Kodungallur). The once-great capital of the [[Chera dynasty]] of [[Sangam period]] had recently been facing various natural disasters. The channels that connected Cranganore to the waterways were silted up, breaking open a competing sea outlet by Cochin in the 14th century.<ref group=note>Cochin was originally just a village along a long embankment.  Violent overflows of the [[Periyar River]] in 1341 forced the opening of the outlet between the Vembanad lagoon and the Arabian Sea at the juncture where Cochin now sits, separating the long Cochinese peninsula from what is now [[Vypin]] island. See Hunter's ''Imperial Gazetteer'' (1908, p.360).</ref> Cochin's rise had been principally due to the re-routing of commercial traffic away from Cranganore. Nonetheless, the remaining merchants of the dwindling city still maintained their old connections to the Kerala pepper plantations in the interior. Finding the supply in Cochin running low, Cabral took up the offer to load some cargo at Cranganore.\n\nThe visit to Cranganore turned out to be an eye-opener for the Portuguese, for among the city's remaining inhabitants are substantial established communities of [[Cochin Jews|Malabari Jews]] and [[Syrian Malabar Nasrani|Syrian Christians]].  The encounter with a clearly recognizable Christian community in Kerala confirmed to Cabral what the Franciscan friars had already suspected back in Calicut, namely that Vasco da Gama's earlier hypothesis about a \"Hindu Church\" was mistaken. If real Christians had existed alongside Hindus in India for centuries, after all, then clearly Hinduism must be a distinct religion. Hindus were \"heathen idolaters\", as the Portuguese friars characterized them, rather than adherents to a \"primitive\" form of Christianity.  Two Syrian Christian priests from Cranganore applied to Cabral for passage to Europe.<ref group=note>One of these priests, known as Jos\u00e9 de Cranganore or Joseph the Indian (''Josephus Indus''), eventually would provide instrumental intelligence about India to the Portuguese. Upon arrival in Lisbon, Joseph the Indian spent a couple of years being intensely interviewed by the Portuguese court and the [[Casa da \u00cdndia]], relating to them his detailed knowledge of the history and geography of India and the east, expanding Portuguese intelligence dramatically. It is likely that the detailed depiction of the east Indian coast and the [[Bay of Bengal]] in the [[Cantino planisphere]] of 1502 is owed in large part to this information.  Around 1503, Joseph went to Rome to meet [[Pope Alexander VI]] and report on the condition of the Malabari Syrian Christian church.  It was on this trip that Joseph dictated his famous narrative on India to an Italian scribe, which was eventually published in 1507 (in Italian) as part of a collection, ''Paesi Novamente Retrovati'', edited by Fracanzio da Montalboddo.  The narrative includes Joseph's own account of Cabral's expedition.  See Vallavanthara (2001).</ref>\n\nOn January 16, 1501, news arrived that the Zamorin of Calicut had assembled and dispatched a fleet of around 80 boats against the Portuguese in Cochin.  Despite the Trimumpara Raja of Cochin's offer of military assistance against the Calicut fleet, Cabral decided to precipitously lift anchor and slip away rather than risk a confrontation. Cabral's armada left behind the factor Gon\u00e7alo Gil Barbosa and six assistants in Cochin. In their hasty departure, the Portuguese inadvertently took along two of the Trimumpara's officers (Idikkela Menon and Parangoda Mennon), who had been serving as hostages aboard the vessels.\n\nHeading north, Cabral's armada took a wide sweep to avoid Calicut, and paid a quick visit to Cannanore. Cabral was warmly received by the [[Kolathiri]] Raja of Cannanore who, eager for a Portuguese alliance, offered to sell the Portuguese spices on credit. Cabral accepted the cargo but paid him nonetheless. Even though the cargo turned out to only be low-quality ginger, Cabral was appreciative of the gesture. \n\nHis ships now filled with spices, Cabral decided not to visit Quilon, as he had earlier promised, but to make way back home to Portugal instead.\n\n== Diogo Dias' misadventures ==\n{{Unreferenced-section|date=April 2020}}\nWhile Cabral's main fleet was in India, [[Diogo Dias]], captain of the missing seventh ship of the armada, was going through his own set of adventures.\n\n[[File:Detail of Diogo Dias's ship (Cabral Armada).jpg|thumb|180px|Ship of [[Diogo Dias]], detail from the ''Mem\u00f3ria das Armadas'']]\nShortly after being separated from the main fleet at the Cape in June 1500, Dias had struck out too far east into the Indian Ocean and sighted the western coast of the island of [[Madagascar]].  Although the island was not unknown (its Arab name, \"island of the Moon\", was already reported by [[Pero de Covilha|Covilh\u00e3]]), Diogo Dias was the first Portuguese captain to have sighted it and is often credited with renaming it the island of ''S\u00e3o Louren\u00e7o'', on account of it being found on [[St. Lawrence]]'s day (August 10, 1500).  However, a proper landing on Madagascar would not be undertaken until 1506 and it would only be extensively explored in 1508.\n\nProbably thinking he was on a South African island, Diogo Dias tried to find the African coast by sailing straight north from Madagascar, hoping to reconnect with Cabral's armada there, or at least to make it to [[Sofala]] (Dias's formal destination).  But to no avail.  He had struck too far east, and was heading along north in open ocean.  Dias sighted the African coast only around [[Mogadishu]] (''Magadoxo''). By this time, Cabral had already crossed the Indian Ocean, and the change in the monsoon winds prevented Dias from undertaking his own crossing. Dias pushed up the coast, unexpectedly going past [[Cape Guardafui]] into the [[Gulf of Aden]], waters as yet unsailed by Portuguese ships.  Dias spent the next few months in the area\u2014trapped by contrary winds, battered by tempests, attacked by Arab pirates, and forced aground on the [[Eritrea]]n coast, in a desperate search for water and food.\n\nDias eventually (in late 1500 and early 1501) managed to procure supplies, repair his ship and catch a favorable wind to take him out of that harrowing trap.  With his remaining six crewmen, Dias set sail back to Portugal, hoping to catch Cabral's armada on the return journey.\n\n== Return journey ==\n{{Unreferenced-section|date=April 2020}}\nLate January, 1501 \u2013 Cabral takes aboard an ambassador from Cannanore, and starts his ocean crossing back to East Africa.  On the way, the Portuguese capture a  Gujarati ship, replete with a magnificent cargo.  They steal the cargo, but spare the crew, once they realize they are not Arabs.\n\nFebruary, 1501 \u2013 As Cabral's expedition approaches [[Malindi]], vice-admiral [[Sancho de Tovar]], sailing at the front, runs his spice-laden ship, the ''El Rei'', aground on the Malindi coast.  Irreparable, the great ship is burnt (to recover the iron fittings) and the crews and the cargo reallocated.  Cabral's armada is now reduced to five ships. Cabral authorizes the king of Malindi to recover the cannons from the ''El Rei'' wreck and keep them for himself.\n\nSpring, 1501 \u2013 Cabral's fleet reaches [[Mozambique Island]].  As there is no sign or news from [[Diogo Dias]] awaiting him, Cabral realizes he must take responsibility for the Sofala mission himself.  Cabral orders the private ship ''Anunciada'' of Nuno Leit\u00e3o da Cunha, the fastest in the fleet, to be placed under the command of veteran hand [[Nicolau Coelho]], and dispatched ahead of the rest of the fleet and deliver the results of the voyage to Portugal.  Vice-admiral [[Sancho de Tovar]] (who had lost the ''El-Rei'') is given the chance to make amends by taking command of the caravel ''S\u00e3o Pedro'' (hitherto commanded by [[P\u00earo de Ata\u00edde]]) and seek out Sofala and to proceed home alone from there.  Ata\u00edde is transferred to the command of Coelho's old nau.\n\nIn the meantime, Cabral lands a ''[[degredado]]'' Ant\u00f3nio Fernandes on the African coast, with letters of instruction for Diogo Dias and any passing Portuguese expeditions, informing them of the dramatic turn of events in India, and warning them to avoid Calicut.\n\n[It is uncertain exactly where Cabral left Ant\u00f3nio Fernandes or where he was ordered to go.  According to Ata\u00edde, Fernandes was ordered to go to Mombassa (odd, as Mombassa was then on hostile terms with the Portuguese); others suggest he was supposed to go to Kilwa (which is where the 3rd Armada of [[Jo\u00e3o da Nova]] will find him). Others have speculated that Fernandes was left in Kilwa on the outward leg, and that Cabral's letters were dispatched to him by a local messenger from Mozambique on the return.  Another possibility is that Fernandes was instructed to make his way to Sofala overland, meet Tovar's ship there, and then proceed to explore inland from there to locate [[Monomatapa]] (but then why give him the letters?).  Finally, some conjecture Fernandes is being confused with another degredado, Jo\u00e3o Machado, who had been left in Malindi on the first leg, that he was picked up on the return, and now sent back once again with the letters.]\n\nMarch\u2013April, 1501 \u2013 Matters settled, Cabral takes the remaining three ships\u2014his own flagship, the large nau of Sim\u00e3o de Miranda and Coelho's ship (now under [[P\u00earo de Ata\u00edde]])\u2014and sets sail out of Mozambique island.\n\nAta\u00edde gets separated from the other two in the [[Mozambique Channel]] soon after departure. He hurries to S\u00e3o Br\u00e1s ([[Mossel Bay]], South Africa), hoping to find Cabral there waiting for him.  But he is out of luck\u2014Cabral and Miranda had decided to proceed on together towards Lisbon without him.  Not finding any trace of the others, Ata\u00edde decides to make his way home on his own, leaving behind a letter in a boot by a local watering hole giving an account of the expedition (Ataide's note will be found later that year by [[Jo\u00e3o da Nova]]'s [[3rd Portuguese India Armada (Nova, 1501)|3rd Armada]]).\n\nIn the meantime, Sancho de Tovar, aboard the ''S\u00e3o Pedro'', finally sights [[Sofala]], the entrepot of Monomatapa gold.  He doesn't go ashore, and instead contents himself with scouting the city from his ship, and then sets sail back home alone.\n\n=== Conference at Bezeguiche ===\n\nJune 2, 1501 \u2013 Following up on the discovery of Brazil the previous year, King [[Manuel I of Portugal]] had assembled a small exploratory expedition of three caravels under an unnamed Portuguese captain, and carrying the [[Republic of Florence|Florentine]] cosmographer [[Amerigo Vespucci]] aboard, to explore and map the coast of Brazil.  The exact identity of the captain is uncertain - some speculate it to be [[Gaspar de Lemos]] or [[Andr\u00e9 Gon\u00e7alves (explorer)|Andr\u00e9 Gon\u00e7alves]], whichever of the two had commanded the supply vessel that had delivered the news in June 1500; others conjecture Lemos/Gon\u00e7alves went merely as passengers, and that the expedition itself was commanded by [[Gon\u00e7alo Coelho]].<ref>[[Amerigo Vespucci]] wrote two detailed accounts of this Brazilian mapping expedition - in ''Mundus Novus'' (pub. 1502/03) and as the \"third voyage\" in ''Lettera a Soderini'' (pub.1504/05) - but does not identify the Portuguese captain by name in either.  Chronicler [[Gaspar Correia]], writing a half-century later, identifies the mapping captain as the same captain who steered the returning supply ship - ergo the Lemos/Gon\u00e7alves identification.  Greenlee (1945) suggests the captain was [[Fern\u00e3o de Loronha]], although this has been dismissed by others (e.g. Roukema, 1963).  More recently, historians have drawn attention to a nautical chart by [[Vesconte de Maggiolo]], which identifies the Brazilian landmass with the label ''Tera de Gonsalvo Coigo Vocatur Santa Cruz'' (translated as \"Land of [[Gon\u00e7alo Coelho]] called Santa Cruz\").  [[Gon\u00e7alo Coelho]] is known to have led a later expedition to Brazil (which set out in 1503), but it is commonly estimated that Coelho was still out at sea when Maggiolo composed his chart (c. 1504-05), thereby suggesting Coelho might have also captained the previous 1501 mapping expedition as well. (Morison, 1974, vol. 2, p.281)</ref> Setting out from Lisbon in May 1501, the little Brazilian mapping expedition made a watering stop in early June at ''Bezeguiche'' (as the bay of [[Dakar]] (Senegal) was known to the Portuguese sailors of the time) and stumbles upon  [[Diogo Dias]] cooling his heels there. Dias relates to the Portuguese captain and Vespucci the tales of his misadventures\u2014how he had been separated from Cabral at the Cape, how he had ventured up to the Gulf of Aden, and, finding no trace of Cabral on his return, decided to wait for him in Bezeguiche. Just two days later, the lead ship of the returning India fleet\u2014the ''Anunciada'' under [[Nicolau Coelho]]\u2014sails into Bezeguiche, surprised to find both Dias and the Brazilian mapping expedition there (apparently  Bezeguiche must have been a pre-arranged point of encounter for the Second Armada).\n\nFor the next two weeks, the captains and crews of the different ships exchange tales of their travels and adventures.  It has been since speculated that it was during this time that Amerigo Vespucci came up with his \"[[New World]]\" hypothesis.  After all, Vespucci was quite familiar with the Americas, having participated in [[Alonso de Ojeda|Ojeda]]'s 1499 expedition to the coasts of South America, and it is said he had intense discussions at Bezeguiche with [[Gaspar da Gama]], the Goese Jew aboard Coelho's ship, undoubtedly the person most familiar with the East Indies. Comparing notes, it probably dawned on Vespucci that it was simply impossible to square what he knew of the Americas with what the men of the 2nd Armada knew of Asia.  While still at Bezeguiche, Vespucci wrote a letter to [[Lorenzo de' Medici (1463\u20131503)|Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de' Medici]], relating his encounter, which he sends back with some Florentine passengers on the ''Anunciada''.<ref>Vespucci's 1501 letter is reproduced in Varnhagen (1865).   An English translation can be found in W.H.Greenlee (1938: p.152ff).</ref>  This was a prelude to an even more famous letter of Vespucci to Lorenzo in 1503, shortly after his return, where he finally asserts that the Brazilian landmass was in fact a continent, that the lands discovered to the west were definitely not part of Asia, but must be an entirely different continent, a \"[[New World]]\".<ref>Vespucci (1503). After leaving Bezeguiche, the mapping expedition would make landfall at [[Cape S\u00e3o Roque]] in August 1501, and proceeded to sail south along the Brazilian coast, possibly as far as the [[S\u00e3o Paulo (state)|S\u00e3o Paulo]] coast. They returned to Lisbon before September 1502, perhaps as early as June. A second mapping expedition, this time more certainly under [[Gon\u00e7alo Coelho]], also accompanied by Vespucci (his \"fourth voyage\"), set out for Brazil in April, 1503.</ref>\n\nMid-June, 1501 \u2013 Lemos & Vespucci leave Bezeguiche for Brazil. Shortly after, the pair [[Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral]] and Sim\u00e3o de Miranda themselves reach Bezeguiche, where they find Diogo Dias and Nicolau Coelho awaiting them. Cabral sends Coelho's swift ''Anunciada'' ahead to Lisbon to announce their return, while the remainder rest and wait in Bezeguiche for the remaining two ships.  [[P\u00earo de Ata\u00edde]]'s ship (making his way alone from Mossel Bay) and [[Sancho de Tovar]]'s ''S\u00e3o Pedro'' (returning from Sofala) arrive in Bezeguiche by the end of June.\n\nJune 23, 1501 \u2013 The ''Anunciada'', commanded by [[Nicolau Coelho]], arrives in Lisbon and anchors in [[Bel\u00e9m]].  (Just as in case of Vasco da Gama's expedition, it turns out Nicolau Coelho is once again the first to deliver the news!)  The merchants of the consortium led by [[Bartolomeo Marchionni]] (who own the ''Anunciada'') are delighted.  Letters are immediately fired off throughout Europe announcing the results.\n\nThe news arrives too late for [[Jo\u00e3o da Nova]]'s [[3rd Portuguese India Armada (Nova, 1501)|3rd India Armada]], which departed for India in April.  But Nova will collect the necessary information along the way\u2014from the note in Ata\u00edde's shoe in Mossel Bay, and from Cabral's letters in the possession of Ant\u00f3nio Fernandes in Kilwa.\n\nJuly 21, 1501 \u2013 One month after Coelho's arrival, Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral and Sim\u00e3o de Miranda, the two larger ships, finally arrive in Lisbon. The other three ships arrive a few days later: Sancho de Tovar and P\u00earo de Ata\u00edde on July 25 and the hapless Diogo Dias, with his empty caravel, on July 27.\n\n== Aftermath ==\n{{Refimprove-section|date=April 2020}}\n[[File:Bernardelli - Monumento a Cabral.jpg|thumb|180px|Monument to [[Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral]] in Lisbon, copy of a Brazilian monument by Rodolpho Bernardelli]]\nOn the surface, Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral's 2nd Armada had been a failure and the reaction was conspicuously muted.\n\nShip losses were very heavy. Of the thirteen ships sent out, only five returned with cargo (four crown, one private), five were lost at sea, three returned without cargo (Gaspar de Lemos, Lu\u00eds Pires and Diogo Dias).\n\nHuman losses were even more disheartening.  This included all the crews and captains of the four ships lost at the Cape (notably, the celebrated discoverer Bartolomeu Dias).  Another fifty-something Portuguese (including the factor Aires Correia) had been killed in the Calicut massacre.\n\nThen there were the mission failures.  Relative to the instructions given to him in Lisbon, Cabral had failed on nearly every count:\n*1. failed to establish a treaty with the Zamorin of Calicut\u2014indeed, Calicut was now more hostile than ever.\n*2. failed to establish a factory at Calicut (massacred);\n*3. failed to bring the 'Hindu Church' in line (the friars that survived reported the Hindus weren't Christians after all, just 'idolaters');\n*4. failed to make a treaty with Kilwa;\n*5. failed to establish a factory at Sofala (seen from afar by Tovar, but that is all).\n\nOn the other hand, in his defense, Cabral could point to some positive achievements.\n\n*1. opening of friendly relations with Cochin, Canannore and Quilon;\n*2. a factory in Cochin, poorer than Calicut perhaps, but workable;\n*3. discovery of true Christian communities in Cranganore, etc.;\n*4. Sofala was at least discovered and scouted;\n*5. discovery of Brazil, which might serve as a useful staging post for future India runs;\n*6. Diogo Dias's discovery of Madagascar and exploration of the African coast up to Cape Guardafui and the Gulf of Aden was useful information.\n*7. Finally, Cabral did bring back tons of spices, which were off-loaded into the Lisbon warehouses and sold at no small profit for the crown treasury.\n\nHowever, it was the ship and human losses that weighed heavily against Cabral being honored or rewarded. Allegations of 'incompetence' flew easily in the circles that mattered. Although Cabral was initially offered the command of the [[4th Portuguese India Armada (Gama, 1502)|4th Armada]], scheduled for 1502, it seemed more like a ''pro forma'' gesture than a sincere offer.<ref>Subrahmanyam (1997: p.191)</ref> The crown made it clear that Cabral's command would be limited and supervised \u2013 conditions humiliating enough to force Cabral to withdraw his name.  The 4th Armada would be placed under the command of Vasco da Gama.\n\nAlthough the reaction of Portuguese court opinion in 1501, on Cabral's return, was generally low, it ascended retrospectively.  Cabral's discovery of Brazil, initially received as a minor discovery of little interest, turned out to be much more momentous.  The follow-up Brazilian mapping expeditions of 1501-02 and 1503-04, under the captaincy of [[Gon\u00e7alo Coelho]], carrying the Florentine cosmographer [[Amerigo Vespucci]], revealed a massive continent - which Vespucci famously labelled a \"[[New World]]\" (''Mundus Novus'').  The plentitude of [[brazilwood]] (''pau-brasil'') discovered by the mapping expeditions on its shores lured the interest of European cloth industry, and led to the 1505 contract granted to [[Fern\u00e3o de Loronha]] for the commercial exploitation of Brazil. The lucrative brazilwood trade eventually drew competition from French and Spanish interlopers, forcing the Portuguese government to take a more active interest in Cabral's \"[[Name of Brazil|Land of Vera Cruz]]\", finally leading to the establishment of the first Portuguese colonies in [[Colonial Brazil]] in 1532.\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Carta de P\u00earo Vaz de Caminha]]\n* [[Portuguese India Armadas]]\n* [[Portuguese India]]\n* [[Alternative theory of the European discovery of Brazil]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|group=note |30em}}\n\n== References == \n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Sources ==\n'''Eyewitness Accounts'''\n\n* [Anonymous Pilot] \"Navigationi del Capitano Pedro Alvares Cabral Scrita per un Piloto Portoghese et Tradotta di Lingua Portoghese in Italiana\", first published in Francanzano Montalbado, 1507, editor, ''Paesi novamente retrovati et Novo Mondo da Alberico Vesputio Florentino intitulato'', Vicenza.
