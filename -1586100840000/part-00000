More complex games, moderated entirely or partially by computer programs, were pioneered by [[Rick Loomis]] of [[Flying Buffalo]] in  1970.  The first such game offered via major email services was ''[[WebWar II]]'' (based on Starweb and licensed from Flying Buffalo) from Neolithic Enterprises who accepted email turns from all of the major email services including [[CompuServe]] in 1983.\n\nPlay by mail games are often referred to as PBM games, and play by email is sometimes abbreviated PBeM\u2014as opposed to face to face (FTF) or over the board (OTB) games which are played in person. Another variation on the name is [[play-by-Internet]] (PBI) or play-by-web (PBW). In all of these examples, player instructions can be either executed by a human moderator, a computer program, or a combination of the two.\n\nIn the 1980s, play-by-mail games reached their peak of popularity with the advent of ''[[Gaming Universal]]'', ''[[Paper Mayhem]]'' and ''[[Flagship magazine]]'', the first professional magazines devoted to play-by-mail games. (An earlier fanzine, ''[[The Nuts & Bolts of PBM]]'', was the first publication to exclusively cover the hobby.) Bob McLain, the publisher and editor of Gaming Universal, further popularized the hobby by writing articles that appeared in many of the leading mainstream gaming magazines of the time. Flagship later bought overseas right to Gaming Universal, making it the leading magazine in the field. ''Flagship magazine'' was founded by Chris Harvey and [[Nick Palmer]]. \n\nIn the late 1990s, computer and Internet games marginalized play-by-mail conducted by actual postal mail, but the postal hobby still exists with an estimated 2000\u20133000 adherents worldwide.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Postcard-for-correspondence-chess (trimmed image).png|thumb|right|Postcard for international correspondence chess]]\nThe earliest play-by-mail games developed as a way for geographically separated gamers to compete with each other using [[postal mail]]. [[Chess]] is the oldest example of this type. It has been played for hundreds of years in various countries by mail. In this two player game, players send moves directly to each other. Multi-player games emerged later. ''[[Diplomacy (game)|Diplomacy]]'' is an example of this type in which a central [[game master]] manages the game, receiving moves and publishing adjudications. ''Diplomacy'' was first played by mail in 1963.<ref name=babcock/> In the early 1970s, in the United States, [[Rick Loomis]], of [[Flying Buffalo Inc]], began a number of multi-player play-by-mail games;<ref>{{Cite journal |first= Rick|last= Loomis|authorlink= |coauthors= |year= 2013|month= |title= Letter from Rick Loomis to the Play By Mail/Email/Web/Turn Based Games Community |journal= Suspense and Decision|volume= December 2013|issue= No. 2|pages= 38|id= |url= http://playbymail.net/SuspenseAndDecision/Issue2.pdf |accessdate= March 20, 2020|quote= }}</ref> this included games such as ''[[Nuclear Destruction (play-by-mail)|Nuclear Destruction]]'', which launched in 1970.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.flyingbuffalo.com/nucdest.htm|title= Nuclear Destruction|author= |date= |work= Flying Buffalo, Inc|publisher= Flying Buffalo, Inc|accessdate= March 27, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThis began the professional PBM industry in the United States. Professional game moderation started in 1971 at Flying Buffalo which added games such as [[Battleplan (play-by-mail game)|''Battleplan'']], ''[[Heroic Fantasy]]'', ''[[Starweb]]'', and others, which by the late 1980s were all computer moderated.<ref name=Townsend>{{cite magazine |last= Townsend|first= Jim|date= 1988|title= The PBM Corner|url= |magazine= [[White Wolf]]|location= |publisher= | issue = 11|page= 20|access-date=}}</ref> For approximately five years, Flying Buffalo was the single dominant company in the US PBM industry until [[Schubel & Son]] entered the field in \"roughly\" 1976 with the human-moderated ''[[The Tribes of Crane|Tribes of Crane]]'' game.<ref name=Townsend/> Schubel & Son introduced fee structure innovations which allowed players to pay additional fees for additional options or special actions outside of the rules. This provided players with larger bankrolls the advantage or the ability to abuse game systems.<ref name=Townsend/>\n\nThe next \"big entrance\" was [[Superior Simulations]] with its game ''[[Empyrean Challenge]]'' in 1978.<ref name=Townsend/> Reviewer Jim Townsend asserted that it was \"the most complex game system on Earth\" with some large position turn results 1,000 pages in length.<ref name=Townsend/> By 1980, the PBM field was growing but still nascent: there were still only two sizable commercial PBM companies, and only a few small ones.<ref name=Poplizio>{{cite magazine |last1= Popolizio|first1= Mike |last2= LeBlanc|first2= Liz |last3= Popolizio|first3= Marti |date= 1990|title= Revamping a Classic!

According to Jim Townsend: <blockquote>In the late 70's and all of the 80's, many small PBM firms have opened their doors and better than 90% of them have failed. Although PBM is an easy industry to get into, staying in business is another thing entirely. Literally hundreds of PBM companies have come and gone, most of them taking the money of would-be-customers with them.<ref name=Townsend/></blockquote>\n\nTownsend emphasized the risks for the PBM industry in that \"The new PBM company has such a small chance of surviving that no insurance company would write a policy to cover them. Skydivers are a better risk.\"<ref name=Townsend89>{{cite magazine |last= Townsend|first= Jim|date= February 1989|title= The PBM Corner|url= |magazine= [[White Wolf Magazine]]|location= |publisher= | issue = 14|page= 55|access-date=}}</ref> By the late 1980s, of the more than one hundred play-by-mail companies operating, the majority were hobbies\u2013not run as business to make money.<ref name=Townsend12>{{cite magazine |last= Townsend|first= Jim|date= |title= The PBM Corner|url= |magazine= [[White Wolf Magazine]]|location= |publisher= | issue = 12|page= 19|access-date=}}</ref> Jim Townsend estimated that, in 1988, there were about a dozen profitable PBM companies in the United States\u2014with an additional few in the [[United Kingdom]] and the same in [[Australia]].<ref name=Townsend12/>\n\nThe proliferation of PBM companies in the 1980s supported the publication of a number of newsletters from individual play-by-mail companies as well as independent publications such as ''[[Gaming Universal]]'', ''[[Paper Mayhem]]'', and [[Flagship Magazine|''Flagship'']] which focused solely on the play-by-mail gaming industry.  \n\nThe 1990s brought the onset of the digital age of computers, with many gamers shifting to digital platforms versus play-by-mail games. But with the shift to the digital age has come new opportunities as well. PBM companies have introduced play-by-email (PBeM) options or games that are run in a turn-based fashion by email only.   \n\nIn the early 1990s, the PBM industry still maintained some of the momentum from the 1980s. In 1993, Flagship magazine listed 185 active play-by-mail games.<ref>{{cite magazine |last= Proctor|first= Judith|date= March\u2013April 1993|title= The PBM Corner|url= |magazine= [[White Wolf]]|location= |publisher= | issue = 35|page= 51|access-date=}}</ref> However, over time, the play-by-mail industry has gradually declined. \n\nIn 1998, ''Paper Mayhem'' magazine ceased publication suddenly after the unexpected death of its longtime editor in chief, David Webber.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://playbymail.net/SuspenseAndDecision/Issue-5-Suspense&Decision.pdf|title= Using Play By Mail in a Novel's Plot: The Story Behind for the Love of Airagos|author= Muir, Shannon |date= December 2013|work= Suspense and Decision, Vol. No. 5|publisher= PlayByMail.net|accessdate= February 15, 2020|page=14|ref= Mui13}}</ref> The last of the play-by-mail magazines started in the 1980s, ''Flagship'', went out of print in 2010.

An average PBM game has 10\u201320 players in it, but there are also games that have hundreds of players. Turn around time is the length of time it takes to get your turn back from a company. The average turnaround time is 2 weeks. Some games never end. They can go on virtually forever or until you decide to drop. Many games have victory conditions that can be achieved within a year or two. Prices vary for the different PBM games, but the average price per turn [in 1993] is about $5.00.<ref name=frontmatter/></blockquote>\n\n===Mechanics===\nAfter the initial setup of a PBM game, players begin submitting turn orders. In general, players fill out a turn sheet for a game and mail it back to the gaming company.<ref name=frontmatter>{{Cite journal |last= Paper Mayhem|authorlink= |year= 1993|title= Front Matter|journal= Paper Mayhem: The Informative Play by Mail Magazine|volume= Jan/Feb 1993|issue= #58|pages= 1|id= |url= |accessdate= |quote= }}</ref> The company processes the turns and sends back turns sheets to the players so they can make subsequent moves.<ref name=frontmatter/>  \n\nR. Danard further separates a typical PBM turn into four parts: \n\n::1. the player receives feedback on its position and what happened during the previous turn; \n::2. based on these results, he makes contact or not with other players (diplomatic phase); \n::3. he writes his orders and dispatches them to the referee; \n::4. orders are entered into the computer, processed and the results are sent to players. \n\nThis continues until the game or player is done.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://jpc.danard.net/en/playbymail.php|title= Play-by-mail: Overview|author= R. Danard|date= 2020|work= |publisher= jpc.danard.net|accessdate= April 4, 2020}}. The four parts are exact quotes.</ref>\n\n===Advantages and disadvantages of PBM gaming===\n\nJudith Proctor noted that play-by-mail games have a number of advantages. These include (1) plenty of time\u2014potentially days\u2014to plan a move, (2) never lacking players to face who have \"new tactics and ideas\", (3) the ability to play an \"incredibly complex\" game against live opponents, (4) meeting diverse gamers from far-away locations, and (5) relatively low costs.<ref name=Proctor>{{Cite magazine |first= Judith |last= Proctor |date=March\u2013April 1993 |title= PBM Corner: Not Just for a Dull Evening |magazine= [[White Wolf Magazine]] |number=35|page= 51 |ref= }}</ref> Andrew Greenberg also pointed to the number of players possible in a multi-player game (\"as many as fifty teams\"), comparing it to his past failure at once trying to host an eleven-player [[Dungeons and Dragons]] Game.<ref name=Greenberg>{{Cite magazine |first= Andrew|last= Greenberg |date=May\u2013June 1993 |title= PBM Corner: A Beginning in Play-By-Mail; Is it Worth It? |magazine= [[White Wolf Magazine]] |number=36|page= 51 |ref= }}</ref>\n\nGreenberg identified a number of drawbacks for play-by-mail games. He stated that the \"most obvious\" was the cost, because most games require a setup cost and a fee per turn, and some games can become expensive.<ref name=Greenberg/> Another drawback is the lack of face-to-face roleplaying inherent in play-by-mail games.<ref name=Greenberg/> Finally, game complexity in some cases and occasional delays in turn processing can also be negatives in the genre.<ref name=Greenberg/>\n\n===Closed versus open ended===\nAccording to John Kevin Loth III, \"In theory, an open ended game lasts forever\" and there is no \"ultimate goal\" or way to win the game.<ref name=Loth86>{{Cite magazine |first= John Kevin|last= Loth |date=March\u2013April 1986 |title= A PBM Primer |magazine= [[Paper Mayhem]] |number=17|page= 42 |ref= }}</ref> In open ended games, the designer has provided a system that enables players to develop with no upper limit.

More complex games, moderated entirely or partially by computer programs, were pioneered by [[Rick Loomis]] of [[Flying Buffalo]] in  1970.  The first such game offered via major email services was ''[[WebWar II]]'' (based on Starweb and licensed from Flying Buffalo) from Neolithic Enterprises who accepted email turns from all of the major email services including [[CompuServe]] in 1983.\n\nPlay by mail games are often referred to as PBM games, and play by email is sometimes abbreviated PBeM\u2014as opposed to face to face (FTF) or over the board (OTB) games which are played in person. Another variation on the name is [[play-by-Internet]] (PBI) or play-by-web (PBW). In all of these examples, player instructions can be either executed by a human moderator, a computer program, or a combination of the two.\n\nIn the 1980s, play-by-mail games reached their peak of popularity with the advent of ''[[Gaming Universal]]'', ''[[Paper Mayhem]]'' and ''[[Flagship magazine]]'', the first professional magazines devoted to play-by-mail games. (An earlier fanzine, ''[[The Nuts & Bolts of PBM]]'', was the first publication to exclusively cover the hobby.) Bob McLain, the publisher and editor of Gaming Universal, further popularized the hobby by writing articles that appeared in many of the leading mainstream gaming magazines of the time. Flagship later bought overseas right to Gaming Universal, making it the leading magazine in the field. ''Flagship magazine'' was founded by Chris Harvey and [[Nick Palmer]]. \n\nIn the late 1990s, computer and Internet games marginalized play-by-mail conducted by actual postal mail, but the postal hobby still exists with an estimated 2000\u20133000 adherents worldwide.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Postcard-for-correspondence-chess (trimmed image).png|thumb|right|Postcard for international correspondence chess]]\nThe earliest play-by-mail games developed as a way for geographically separated gamers to compete with each other using [[postal mail]]. [[Chess]] is the oldest example of this type. It has been played for hundreds of years in various countries by mail. In this two player game, players send moves directly to each other. Multi-player games emerged later. ''[[Diplomacy (game)|Diplomacy]]'' is an example of this type in which a central [[game master]] manages the game, receiving moves and publishing adjudications. ''Diplomacy'' was first played by mail in 1963.<ref name=babcock/> In the early 1970s, in the United States, [[Rick Loomis]], of [[Flying Buffalo Inc]], began a number of multi-player play-by-mail games;<ref>{{Cite journal |first= Rick|last= Loomis|authorlink= |coauthors= |year= 2013|month= |title= Letter from Rick Loomis to the Play By Mail/Email/Web/Turn Based Games Community |journal= Suspense and Decision|volume= December 2013|issue= No. 2|pages= 38|id= |url= http://playbymail.net/SuspenseAndDecision/Issue2.pdf |accessdate= March 20, 2020|quote= }}</ref> this included games such as ''[[Nuclear Destruction (play-by-mail)|Nuclear Destruction]]'', which launched in 1970.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.flyingbuffalo.com/nucdest.htm|title= Nuclear Destruction|author= |date= |work= Flying Buffalo, Inc|publisher= Flying Buffalo, Inc|accessdate= March 27, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThis began the professional PBM industry in the United States. Professional game moderation started in 1971 at Flying Buffalo which added games such as [[Battleplan (play-by-mail game)|''Battleplan'']], ''[[Heroic Fantasy]]'', ''[[Starweb]]'', and others, which by the late 1980s were all computer moderated.<ref name=Townsend>{{cite magazine |last= Townsend|first= Jim|date= 1988|title= The PBM Corner|url= |magazine= [[White Wolf]]|location= |publisher= | issue = 11|page= 20|access-date=}}</ref> For approximately five years, Flying Buffalo was the single dominant company in the US PBM industry until [[Schubel & Son]] entered the field in \"roughly\" 1976 with the human-moderated ''[[The Tribes of Crane|Tribes of Crane]]'' game.<ref name=Townsend/> Schubel & Son introduced fee structure innovations which allowed players to pay additional fees for additional options or special actions outside of the rules. This provided players with larger bankrolls the advantage or the ability to abuse game systems.<ref name=Townsend/>\n\nThe next \"big entrance\" was [[Superior Simulations]] with its game ''[[Empyrean Challenge]]'' in 1978.<ref name=Townsend/> Reviewer Jim Townsend asserted that it was \"the most complex game system on Earth\" with some large position turn results 1,000 pages in length.<ref name=Townsend/> By 1980, the PBM field was growing but still nascent: there were still only two sizable commercial PBM companies, and only a few small ones.<ref name=Poplizio>{{cite magazine |last1= Popolizio|first1= Mike |last2= LeBlanc|first2= Liz |last3= Popolizio|first3= Marti |date= 1990|title= Revamping a Classic!

According to Jim Townsend: <blockquote>In the late 70's and all of the 80's, many small PBM firms have opened their doors and better than 90% of them have failed. Although PBM is an easy industry to get into, staying in business is another thing entirely. Literally hundreds of PBM companies have come and gone, most of them taking the money of would-be-customers with them.<ref name=Townsend/></blockquote>\n\nTownsend emphasized the risks for the PBM industry in that \"The new PBM company has such a small chance of surviving that no insurance company would write a policy to cover them. Skydivers are a better risk.\"<ref name=Townsend89>{{cite magazine |last= Townsend|first= Jim|date= February 1989|title= The PBM Corner|url= |magazine= [[White Wolf Magazine]]|location= |publisher= | issue = 14|page= 55|access-date=}}</ref> By the late 1980s, of the more than one hundred play-by-mail companies operating, the majority were hobbies\u2013not run as business to make money.<ref name=Townsend12>{{cite magazine |last= Townsend|first= Jim|date= |title= The PBM Corner|url= |magazine= [[White Wolf Magazine]]|location= |publisher= | issue = 12|page= 19|access-date=}}</ref> Jim Townsend estimated that, in 1988, there were about a dozen profitable PBM companies in the United States\u2014with an additional few in the [[United Kingdom]] and the same in [[Australia]].<ref name=Townsend12/>\n\nThe proliferation of PBM companies in the 1980s supported the publication of a number of newsletters from individual play-by-mail companies as well as independent publications such as ''[[Gaming Universal]]'', ''[[Paper Mayhem]]'', and [[Flagship Magazine|''Flagship'']] which focused solely on the play-by-mail gaming industry.  \n\nThe 1990s brought the onset of the digital age of computers, with many gamers shifting to digital platforms versus play-by-mail games. But with the shift to the digital age has come new opportunities as well. PBM companies have introduced play-by-email (PBeM) options or games that are run in a turn-based fashion by email only.   \n\nIn the early 1990s, the PBM industry still maintained some of the momentum from the 1980s. In 1993, Flagship magazine listed 185 active play-by-mail games.<ref>{{cite magazine |last= Proctor|first= Judith|date= March\u2013April 1993|title= The PBM Corner|url= |magazine= [[White Wolf]]|location= |publisher= | issue = 35|page= 51|access-date=}}</ref> However, over time, the play-by-mail industry has gradually declined. \n\nIn 1998, ''Paper Mayhem'' magazine ceased publication suddenly after the unexpected death of its longtime editor in chief, David Webber.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://playbymail.net/SuspenseAndDecision/Issue-5-Suspense&Decision.pdf|title= Using Play By Mail in a Novel's Plot: The Story Behind for the Love of Airagos|author= Muir, Shannon |date= December 2013|work= Suspense and Decision, Vol. No. 5|publisher= PlayByMail.net|accessdate= February 15, 2020|page=14|ref= Mui13}}</ref> The last of the play-by-mail magazines started in the 1980s, ''Flagship'', went out of print in 2010.

An average PBM game has 10\u201320 players in it, but there are also games that have hundreds of players. Turn around time is the length of time it takes to get your turn back from a company. The average turnaround time is 2 weeks. Some games never end. They can go on virtually forever or until you decide to drop. Many games have victory conditions that can be achieved within a year or two. Prices vary for the different PBM games, but the average price per turn [in 1993] is about $5.00.<ref name=frontmatter/></blockquote>\n\n===Mechanics===\nAfter the initial setup of a PBM game, players begin submitting turn orders. In general, players fill out a turn sheet for a game and mail it back to the gaming company.<ref name=frontmatter>{{Cite journal |last= Paper Mayhem|authorlink= |year= 1993|title= Front Matter|journal= Paper Mayhem: The Informative Play by Mail Magazine|volume= Jan/Feb 1993|issue= #58|pages= 1|id= |url= |accessdate= |quote= }}</ref> The company processes the turns and sends back turns sheets to the players so they can make subsequent moves.<ref name=frontmatter/>  \n\nR. Danard further separates a typical PBM turn into four parts: \n\n::1. the player receives feedback on its position and what happened during the previous turn; \n::2. based on these results, he makes contact or not with other players (diplomatic phase); \n::3. he writes his orders and dispatches them to the referee; \n::4. orders are entered into the computer, processed and the results are sent to players. \n\nThis continues until the game or player is done.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://jpc.danard.net/en/playbymail.php|title= Play-by-mail: Overview|author= R. Danard|date= 2020|work= |publisher= jpc.danard.net|accessdate= April 4, 2020}}. The four parts are exact quotes.</ref>\n\n===Advantages and disadvantages of PBM gaming===\n\nJudith Proctor noted that play-by-mail games have a number of advantages. These include (1) plenty of time\u2014potentially days\u2014to plan a move, (2) never lacking players to face who have \"new tactics and ideas\", (3) the ability to play an \"incredibly complex\" game against live opponents, (4) meeting diverse gamers from far-away locations, and (5) relatively low costs.<ref name=Proctor>{{Cite magazine |first= Judith |last= Proctor |date=March\u2013April 1993 |title= PBM Corner: Not Just for a Dull Evening |magazine= [[White Wolf Magazine]] |number=35|page= 51 |ref= }}</ref> Andrew Greenberg also pointed to the number of players possible in a multi-player game (\"as many as fifty teams\"), comparing it to his past failure at once trying to host an eleven-player [[Dungeons and Dragons]] Game.<ref name=Greenberg>{{Cite magazine |first= Andrew|last= Greenberg |date=May\u2013June 1993 |title= PBM Corner: A Beginning in Play-By-Mail; Is it Worth It? |magazine= [[White Wolf Magazine]] |number=36|page= 51 |ref= }}</ref>\n\nGreenberg identified a number of drawbacks for play-by-mail games. He stated that the \"most obvious\" was the cost, because most games require a setup cost and a fee per turn, and some games can become expensive.<ref name=Greenberg/> Another drawback is the lack of face-to-face roleplaying inherent in play-by-mail games.<ref name=Greenberg/> Finally, game complexity in some cases and occasional delays in turn processing can also be negatives in the genre.<ref name=Greenberg/>\n\n===Closed versus open ended===\nAccording to John Kevin Loth III, \"In theory, an open ended game lasts forever\" and there is no \"ultimate goal\" or way to win the game.<ref name=Loth86>{{Cite magazine |first= John Kevin|last= Loth |date=March\u2013April 1986 |title= A PBM Primer |magazine= [[Paper Mayhem]] |number=17|page= 42 |ref= }}</ref> In open ended games, the designer has provided a system that enables players to develop with no upper limit.

Stumbling into a hall of mirrors, he experiments and discovers a way to get in his own reflection. He uses this power to become the criminal Mirror Master,<ref>{{cite book |title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia|last= |first= |year=2004|publisher=Dorling Kindersley Limited|isbn=0-7566-0592-X|page=204}}</ref> and is a frequent foe of [[Flash (comics)|the Flash]]. Scudder dies around the same time as [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]], alongside the [[Icicle (comics)|Icicle]] during the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]''. Later, [[Captain Boomerang]] briefly assumes Scudder's identity, becoming the second Mirror Master. He uses this as an alternate identity with which to commit crimes, thus not alerting his teammates in the [[Suicide Squad]] to his extracurricular activities. Pre-Crisis, he studiea mirrors after someone's reflection is held inside a mirror he was working on in the prison workshop. He then learns how to create creatures of light.\n\nIn ''[[Blackest Night]]'' crossover, Sam Scudder is reanimated as an undead [[Black Lantern Corps|Black Lantern]] during the [[Blackest Night]] and is preparing an attack on [[Rogues (comics)|the Rogues]] with the other deceased members who are also reanimated.<ref>''Blackest Night: The Flash'' #1 (February 2010)</ref>\n\nThe Rogues visit Sam Scudder's old hideout and unveil a giant mirror with the words ''In Case of Flash: Break Glass''.

It's revealed that a year prior he, Captain Cold, Heat Wave and Weather Wizard underwent a procedure at an unknown facility that would merge them with their weapons, giving them superpowers. The procedure went awry, causing an explosion at the facility. [[Golden Glider]], who was also at the facility, was caught in the explosion. The five were given superpowers but each in a twisted manner. Heat Wave gains pyrokinesis but at the cost of his body being burned, Weather Wizard becomes emotionally tied to his weather wand causing constant depression, Sam would be forever trapped in Mirror World, and Golden Glider becomes an astral projection of herself. It is implied that Sam is in a romantic relationship with her.

After he is fired and replaced for refusing to actually kill Animal Man's wife and children, McCulloch helps Animal Man track and fight the same men who gave McCulloch his weapons, but his heroism is short-lived.<ref>''Animal Man'' #8</ref> He continued to work as a criminal and a supervillain-for-hire.

When her plan fails, he joins [[Captain Cold]]'s gang and battles a [[cocaine]] addiction. He seems to sober up since the death of [[Captain Boomerang]].\n\nMcCulloch joins [[Alexander Luthor, Jr.|Alexander Luthor]]'s Secret Society after the Rogue War. He, [[Owen Mercer|Captain Boomerang]] and Captain Cold battle the [[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]] before ''[[Infinite Crisis]]''.

Mirror Master kicks down the door to their bedroom, ordering them down on the floor. When they do not act fast enough, he shoves Martha down, prompting Jonathan to punch him despite McCulloch's warning. Jonathan is restrained on Mirror Master's orders and then smacked upside the head by Mirror Master's rifle, knocking him out. McCulloch orders his men to torch the house before he and his men retreat into his mirror dimension with the Kents in tow. When Superman arrives at his parents burning house Mirror Master greets him through a mirror, mocking Superman, unfazed by his threats. He tells Superman that he will never see his parents again but that they are safe, despite the fact Scudder had to rough up Superman's father. In a rage, Superman smashes the mirror, but Mirror Master is unaffected. He goes on, telling Superman \"Simple message: Stop what you're doing.\" He advises Superman to stay out of government business and that if he persists, they will start \"Sending little pieces of one of them. Maybe we'll even let you choose which one.\" Mirror Master is the subject of a [[Justice League]] manhunt in [[Central City (DC Comics)|Central City]], with several of the Flash's Rogues Gallery being interrogated by the League for McCulloch's location. It is ultimately [[Captain Cold]] who reveals where Mirror Master is: a bar in Keystone City. The [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Flash]] and [[Wonder Woman]] crash the bar and make for McCulloch sitting at the bar, but it is revealed that it is not Mirror Master but a projection from the nearby wall mirror. Mirror Master mocks Flash, but the Speedster has the last laugh when [[Raven (DC Comics)|Raven]] appears behind McCulloch and forces him out halfway from the mirror. Wonder Woman forces the location of Superman's parents out of Mirror Master with her Lasso of Truth and the threat of smashing the mirror he is only halfway out of. Mirror Master quickly reveals that the Kents are in Bolivia. Wonder Woman then orders Mirror Master to strip himself of his weapons so they can use his tech to free the Kents. Though he is not seen after this, he is most likely incarcerated. He then reappears in ''Year Five'', where he is one of the thousands of villains released from Superman's prison by [[Plastic Man]]. He is next seen along his fellow Rogues as their new leader, due to Captain Cold going into hiding, as they meet with [[Batman]], who offers them to help him take down Superman's Regime, due to the Rogues' code against killing, which Batman respects. Mirror Master, along with [[Weather Wizard]], [[Heat Wave (comics)|Heat Wave]], and [[Golden Glider]], attack several Regime buildings in a coordinated attack around the world. They then attack a Regime base in Central City, evacuating the soldiers first before they set to blow it up. [[Bizarro]] though shows up and attacks them. During the fight, Scudder gets knocked unconscious, leaving Golden Glider to try to figure out how to use his belt to escape while Heat Wave and Weather Wizard distract Bizarro. But, when Weather Wizard calls Bizarro a fake, an angry Bizarro lashes out and incinerates him and Heat Wave with his heat vision. Golden Glider, though, manages to escape through a mirror portal with Scudder and they report about what happened to Batman as they mourn Rory and Mardon. They are then seen holding a memorial for Rory and Mardon at a bar, where it is revealed that Scudder and Glider are in a relationship as they share a kiss. The Flash then visits the bar to pay his respects, but Scudder and Glider angrily berate him, thinking he has come to brag and turn them in, but Flash reveals that he has always respected the Rogues and came by to pay his respects. He also agrees to not turn them in as he, Scudder, and Glider share a beer together.\n\n==In other media==\n===Television===\n====Live-action====\n[[File:Mirror Master from Flash TV.jpg|thumb|right|Mirror Master as seen in [[The Flash (1990 TV series)|''The Flash'' (1990 TV series)]]]]\n* The Sam Scudder version of Mirror Master appeared in ''[[The Flash (1990 TV series)|The Flash]]'' 1990 TV series, portrayed by [[David Cassidy]].

The Flash, with help from [[Tina McGee]], uses a high-powered spotlight to blind Scudder and drown out his illusions, allowing the Flash to capture him.\n* Several variations of Mirror Master appear in ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]'' 2010s TV series.\n** Sam Scudder appears in the [[The Flash (season 3)|third season]], portrayed by [[Grey Damon]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/article/exclusive-the-flash-casts-its-mirror-master|title=EXCLUSIVE: \"THE FLASH\" CASTS ITS MIRROR MASTER|publisher=Comic Book Resources|last=Ching|first=Alfred|date=August 10, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0HSlD3ohfg |title=Are More Rogues Coming To CW's Flash? &#124; Newsbite &#124; That Hashtag Show |publisher=YouTube |date=2016-08-10 |accessdate=2016-08-11}}</ref> He is a metahuman with the ability to travel through mirrors and anything with reflective surfaces (similar to the New 52 version) as well as trap people inside such objects after being trapped in a mirror for three years. He briefly traps Barry Allen in a window during a chase, but the speedster's allies are able to free Barry by slowing down the molecules of the 'wormhole' Scudder creates in the mirrors so that Barry can vibrate through it. Barry subsequently isolates Scudder by trapping him in a circle of mirrors; allowing Barry to knock him out until he can be moved to an Iron Heights cell with no reflective surfaces.\n** A company called '''McCulloch Technologies''' appears in the [[The Flash (season 5)|fifth season]] that developed a mirror gun which Team Flash uses to destroy [[Cicada (comics)|Cicada]]'s dagger. A female version of Evan McCulloch named '''Eva McCulloch''' appears as a series regular in the [[The Flash (season 6)|sixth season]]'s second half, portrayed by [[Efrat Dor]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Agard|first=Chancellor|url=https://ew.com/tv/2019/11/21/the-flash-efrat-dor-eva-mcculloch-iris/|title=The Flash casts Mayans M.C. actress in role that 'pushes the boundaries of sanity'|website=Entertainment Weekly|accessdate=November 21, 2019|date=November 21, 2019}}</ref> A quantum engineer, co-founder of McCulloch Technologies, and wife of its CEO Joseph Carver, she was also trapped inside a mirror but she was unable to escape for six years. While she didn't appear to develop abilities at first, after Iris West-Allen was trapped with her during her sixth year in the mirror dimension, Eva discovered she can manipulate mirrors. But once it's discovered that she employed a mirror double of Iris (who suffers any injuries that McCulloch sustains and McCulloch can heal), it's implied that she's always had abilities but chose to hide these abilities  while the real Iris is present.\n\n====Animation====\n* Mirror Master appeared in ''[[Super Friends: The Legendary Super Powers Show]]'', voiced by [[James Avery (actor)|James Avery]]. The Flash doesn't appear in this episode. In the episode \"Reflections in Crime\", Mirror Master sets about trapping the Super Friends inside mirrors called the sixth dimension. The Super Friends managed to escape and trap Mirror Master in a House of Mirrors where he was apprehended upon being unable to find his way out.\n[[File:Mirror master jlu.jpg|200px|thumb|Mirror Master in ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]''.]]\n* An amalgamated version of Mirror Master appears in the ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' animated series and ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'', voiced by [[Alexis Denisof]]. In the episode \"Eclipsed\", an actor hired to play him is seen as part of the [[Wally West|Flash]]'s Lightspeed energy bar commercial. The actual version is an amalgamation of Sam Scudder and Evan McCulloch; he is clearly American like Scudder as well as being a simple criminal and not a hitman but his mirror abilities are tilted more towards McCulloch's enhanced, almost supernatural skills like a Mirror Dimension. In the episode \"Flash and Substance\", he seemed to act as the Rogues' de facto leader, convincing the others to exact revenge upon the Flash for repeatedly thwarting their plots and bringing them to jail, joining forces with Captain Boomerang, Captain Cold, and [[Trickster (comics)|Trickster]]. It was also mentioned by Captain Boomerang that the Flash made Mirror Master eat his own Laser-Kaleidoscope, though Mirror Master dismissed this as being false saying \"That's a rumor! A complete exaggeration. Besides, it was a laser pistol\". The Rogues later demolish the newly opened [[Flash Museum]] upon entering through [[Linda Park (comics)|Linda Park]]'s compact mirror. In his battle with Flash, [[Batman]], and [[Orion (comics)|Orion]], Mirror Master ended up trapped in the broken shards of the mirror after Batman's [[Batarang]] is thrown at one of the mirrors that Mirror Master used. Forensics were shown collecting the pieces of the mirror. Mirror Master had a cameo as a member of the Secret Society in the episode \"The Great Brain Robbery\".\n[[File:TB mirror master.jpg|180px|thumb|right|Mirror Master with his assistant Smoke on ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]''.]]\n* The Sam Scudder version of Mirror Master appeared in the fifth season of ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]'' animated series, voiced by and modeled after [[John Larroquette]]. This version is a brilliant but mad optical [[physics|physicist]] and is said to be the most powerful of the Flash's foes. In \"A Mirror Darkly\", he employed mirror versions of Batman, Flash, and [[Dick Grayson|Robin]] to steal components for his Mirror Portal Ray. He used it to trap Gotham's citizens in any reflective surface--[[mirror]]s, [[window]]s, even a [[silver]] serving tray. On a side note, he has a female assistant named Smoke (voiced by Amanda Anka). In \"Lost Heroes\", he fights Flash and [[Green Arrow]] in a circus fun house only for Green Arrow to cut off his reflection by a slime-emitting arrow.\n* The Evan McCulloch version of Mirror Master appears in ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'', voiced by [[Tom Kenny]]. He and [[Captain Cold]] are mentioned in \"The Golden Age of Justice\" as having been recently defeated by Batman. Mirror Master makes a non-speaking cameo in \"Requiem for a Scarlet Speedster\" where he traps Batman and [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]] in a trap only for Batman to cut him and Allen out of the trap and then for Flash to redirect a beam back to Mirror Master, supposedly knocking him out. In the anthology-only episode \"Four Star Spectacular!\" in the vignette \"Double Trouble\", Mirror Master traps the Flash using a mirror maze and attacks him with a horde of mirror duplicates. Flash eventually realizes which of the images is the one real Mirror Master and knocks him out.\n* Mirror Master appears in the ''[[Robot Chicken]]'' [[Robot Chicken DC Comics Special|DC Comics Special]], voiced by [[Breckin Meyer]]. He appears as a member of the [[Legion of Doom]]. In one segment, he and the [[Riddler]] pressure [[Sinestro]] to shave off his mustache in the bathroom, which leads to Sinestro gushing blood from his upper lip. Mirror Master escapes in a mirror in horror. He next appears in the final segment where he participates in the battle between the [[Justice League]] and the Legion of Doom.\n\n===Film===\n* The Sam Scudder version of Mirror Master appears as an antagonist in ''[[Justice League: Doom]]'' with [[Alexis Denisof]] reprising his role from the ''Justice League'' animated series. He is recruited into [[Vandal Savage]]'s [[Legion of Doom]] before the film's events begin. He sneaks into the [[Batcave]] using the [[Batmobile]]'s rear view mirror and steals [[Batman]]'s contingency plans from the [[Batcomputer]]. He is chosen by Savage to kill The [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Flash]]. Mirror Master gets Flash's attention by robbing a moving train and taking everyone aboard hostage. Flash manages to destroy all of his holograms, but Mirror Master manages to plant a bomb through Flash's wrist while disabling a bomb inside a glass box containing an old woman (actually another hologram). The bomb would go off in 60 seconds should Flash do nothing, try to take it off, and, should he run, if he decelerates. Flash eventually escapes by vibrating molecules though an iceberg, leaving the bomb trapped in the iceberg before it explodes. He toasts Savage at their victory celebration and signs on for his true, genocidal plan. When the Justice League storms the Hall of Doom, he fight The Flash by taking the battle outside and forcing Flash to fight a multitude of solid holograms and new holograms that seem to be made of glass. Eventually Flash takes out all of his holograms and knocks out Mirror Master in one punch.\n* Mirror Master appears in ''[[Justice League: The Flashpoint Paradox]]'' in a non-speaking role. In the film's beginning, he and the Rogues are attacking the Flash, but [[Eobard Thawne|Professor Zoom]] betrays the Rogues and attaches bombs to the Rogues which cannot be removed. When the Justice League arrive and manage to dispose the bombs, [[Hal Jordan|Green Lantern]] takes Mirror Master to space's upper limits where Green Lantern's ring is shielding while Batman uses a laser cutter to remove the bomb which later drops in space from the bomb radius, saving Mirror Master's life. His appearance is notable because his physical body is noticeably bulkier than previous animated incarnations; it is unknown whether this is due to muscle, bone structure, or body fat.\n* In ''[[Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths]]'', an alternate version of [[Lex Luthor]] mentions Mirror Master being head of the police.\n\n===Video games===\n* The Evan McCulloch incarnation of Mirror Master appears in ''[[DC Universe Online]]'', voiced by Brandon Young.\n* Mirror Master makes a cameo appearance in ''[[Injustice: Gods Among Us]]''. In Raven's ending, Mirror Master was seen holding Superman's parents hostage.\n* Mirror Master is mentioned in ''[[Injustice 2]]'' by Cheetah and Captain Cold, the latter of whom betrayed Mirror Master despite Mirror Master having \"leverage\" on Superman. It is unrevealed whether Mirror Master is dead or simply imprisoned.\n* The Evan McCulloch version of Mirror Master appears as a playable character in ''[[Lego DC Super-Villains]]'', voiced by [[Sam Heughan]].\n\n===Music===\n* There is a reference to Mirror Master in the [[Ookla the Mok (band)|Ookla the Mok]] song \"Stranger In The Mirror\". He is referred to in the song lyrics as \"the villain in issue 104 of The Flash,\" though Mirror Master actually debuted in issue 105.\n\n===Miscellaneous===\n* Mirror Master appeared in issue #23 of the ''Super Friends'' spin-off comic book.\n* Mirror Master appeared in issue #12 of the ''Justice League Unlimited'' spin-off comic book.\n* Mirror Master appeared in issue #16 of the ''Batman: The Brave and The Bold'' comic book.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://arrow.wikia.com/wiki/Sam_Scudder Arrowverse entry for Mirror Master I]\n* [http://arrow.wikia.com/wiki/Evan_McCulloch Arrowverse entry for Mirror Master II]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060323061226/http://www.monitorduty.com/mdarchives/2005/12/alan_kistlers_p_3.shtml Alan Kistler's Profile On: THE FLASH] - A detailed analysis of the history of the Flash by comic book historian Alan Kistler.

Stumbling into a hall of mirrors, he experiments and discovers a way to get in his own reflection. He uses this power to become the criminal Mirror Master,<ref>{{cite book |title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia|last= |first= |year=2004|publisher=Dorling Kindersley Limited|isbn=0-7566-0592-X|page=204}}</ref> and is a frequent foe of [[the Flash]]. Scudder dies around the same time as [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]], alongside the [[Icicle (comics)|Icicle]] during the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]''. Later, [[Captain Boomerang]] briefly assumes Scudder's identity, becoming the second Mirror Master. He uses this as an alternate identity with which to commit crimes, thus not alerting his teammates in the [[Suicide Squad]] to his extracurricular activities. Pre-Crisis, he studiea mirrors after someone's reflection is held inside a mirror he was working on in the prison workshop. He then learns how to create creatures of light.\n\nIn ''[[Blackest Night]]'' crossover, Sam Scudder is reanimated as an undead [[Black Lantern Corps|Black Lantern]] during the [[Blackest Night]] and is preparing an attack on [[Rogues (comics)|the Rogues]] with the other deceased members who are also reanimated.<ref>''Blackest Night: The Flash'' #1 (February 2010)</ref>\n\nThe Rogues visit Sam Scudder's old hideout and unveil a giant mirror with the words ''In Case of Flash: Break Glass''.

It's revealed that a year prior he, Captain Cold, Heat Wave and Weather Wizard underwent a procedure at an unknown facility that would merge them with their weapons, giving them superpowers. The procedure went awry, causing an explosion at the facility. [[Golden Glider]], who was also at the facility, was caught in the explosion. The five were given superpowers but each in a twisted manner. Heat Wave gains pyrokinesis but at the cost of his body being burned, Weather Wizard becomes emotionally tied to his weather wand causing constant depression, Sam would be forever trapped in Mirror World, and Golden Glider becomes an astral projection of herself. It is implied that Sam is in a romantic relationship with her.

Mirror Master kicks down the door to their bedroom, ordering them down on the floor. When they do not act fast enough, he shoves Martha down, prompting Jonathan to punch him despite McCulloch's warning. Jonathan is restrained on Mirror Master's orders and then smacked upside the head by Mirror Master's rifle, knocking him out. McCulloch orders his men to torch the house before he and his men retreat into his mirror dimension with the Kents in tow. When Superman arrives at his parents burning house Mirror Master greets him through a mirror, mocking Superman, unfazed by his threats. He tells Superman that he will never see his parents again but that they are safe, despite the fact Scudder had to rough up Superman's father. In a rage, Superman smashes the mirror, but Mirror Master is unaffected. He goes on, telling Superman \"Simple message: Stop what you're doing.\" He advises Superman to stay out of government business and that if he persists, they will start \"Sending little pieces of one of them. Maybe we'll even let you choose which one.\" Mirror Master is the subject of a [[Justice League]] manhunt in [[Central City (DC Comics)|Central City]], with several of the Flash's Rogues Gallery being interrogated by the League for McCulloch's location. It is ultimately [[Captain Cold]] who reveals where Mirror Master is: a bar in Keystone City. The [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Flash]] and [[Wonder Woman]] crash the bar and make for McCulloch sitting at the bar, but it is revealed that it is not Mirror Master but a projection from the nearby wall mirror. Mirror Master mocks Flash, but the Speedster has the last laugh when [[Raven (DC Comics)|Raven]] appears behind McCulloch and forces him out halfway from the mirror. Wonder Woman forces the location of Superman's parents out of Mirror Master with her Lasso of Truth and the threat of smashing the mirror he is only halfway out of. Mirror Master quickly reveals that the Kents are in Bolivia. Wonder Woman then orders Mirror Master to strip himself of his weapons so they can use his tech to free the Kents. Though he is not seen after this, he is most likely incarcerated. He then reappears in ''Year Five'', where he is one of the thousands of villains released from Superman's prison by [[Plastic Man]]. He is next seen along his fellow Rogues as their new leader, due to Captain Cold going into hiding, as they meet with [[Batman]], who offers them to help him take down Superman's Regime, due to the Rogues' code against killing, which Batman respects. Mirror Master, along with [[Weather Wizard]], [[Heat Wave (comics)|Heat Wave]], and [[Golden Glider]], attack several Regime buildings in a coordinated attack around the world. They then attack a Regime base in Central City, evacuating the soldiers first before they set to blow it up. [[Bizarro]] though shows up and attacks them. During the fight, Scudder gets knocked unconscious, leaving Golden Glider to try to figure out how to use his belt to escape while Heat Wave and Weather Wizard distract Bizarro. But, when Weather Wizard calls Bizarro a fake, an angry Bizarro lashes out and incinerates him and Heat Wave with his heat vision. Golden Glider, though, manages to escape through a mirror portal with Scudder and they report about what happened to Batman as they mourn Rory and Mardon. They are then seen holding a memorial for Rory and Mardon at a bar, where it is revealed that Scudder and Glider are in a relationship as they share a kiss. The Flash then visits the bar to pay his respects, but Scudder and Glider angrily berate him, thinking he has come to brag and turn them in, but Flash reveals that he has always respected the Rogues and came by to pay his respects. He also agrees to not turn them in as he, Scudder, and Glider share a beer together.\n\n==In other media==\n===Television===\n====Live-action====\n[[File:Mirror Master from Flash TV.jpg|thumb|right|Mirror Master as seen in [[The Flash (1990 TV series)|''The Flash'' (1990 TV series)]]]]\n* The Sam Scudder version of Mirror Master appeared in ''[[The Flash (1990 TV series)|The Flash]]'' 1990 TV series, portrayed by [[David Cassidy]]. This version is a criminal who uses [[hologram]]s projected by small mirrored disks to commit his heists. In the episode \"Done with Mirrors\", he steals a crystal from S.T.A.R. Labs and attempts to kill his ex-partner Stasia Masters, a high school girlfriend of Barry Allen. The Flash, with help from [[Tina McGee]], uses a high-powered spotlight to blind Scudder and drown out his illusions, allowing the Flash to capture him.\n* Several variations of Mirror Master appear in ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]'' 2010s TV series.\n** Sam Scudder appears in the [[The Flash (season 3)|third season]], portrayed by [[Grey Damon]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/article/exclusive-the-flash-casts-its-mirror-master|title=EXCLUSIVE: \"THE FLASH\" CASTS ITS MIRROR MASTER|publisher=Comic Book Resources|last=Ching|first=Alfred|date=August 10, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0HSlD3ohfg |title=Are More Rogues Coming To CW's Flash? &#124; Newsbite &#124; That Hashtag Show |publisher=YouTube |date=2016-08-10 |accessdate=2016-08-11}}</ref> He is a metahuman with the ability to travel through mirrors and anything with reflective surfaces (similar to the New 52 version) as well as trap people inside such objects after being trapped in a mirror for three years. He briefly traps Barry Allen in a window during a chase, but the speedster's allies are able to free Barry by slowing down the molecules of the 'wormhole' Scudder creates in the mirrors so that Barry can vibrate through it. Barry subsequently isolates Scudder by trapping him in a circle of mirrors; allowing Barry to knock him out until he can be moved to an Iron Heights cell with no reflective surfaces.\n** A company called '''McCulloch Technologies''' appears in the [[The Flash (season 5)|fifth season]] that developed a mirror gun which Team Flash uses to destroy [[Cicada (comics)|Cicada]]'s dagger. A female version of Evan McCulloch named '''Eva McCulloch''' appears as a series regular in the [[The Flash (season 6)|sixth season]]'s second half, portrayed by [[Efrat Dor]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Agard|first=Chancellor|url=https://ew.com/tv/2019/11/21/the-flash-efrat-dor-eva-mcculloch-iris/|title=The Flash casts Mayans M.C. actress in role that 'pushes the boundaries of sanity'|website=Entertainment Weekly|accessdate=November 21, 2019|date=November 21, 2019}}</ref> A quantum engineer, co-founder of McCulloch Technologies, and wife of its CEO Joseph Carver, she was also trapped inside a mirror but she was unable to escape for six years. While she didn't appear to develop abilities at first, after Iris West-Allen was trapped with her during her sixth year in the mirror dimension, Eva discovered she can manipulate mirrors. But once it's discovered that she employed a mirror double of Iris (who suffers any injuries that McCulloch sustains and McCulloch can heal), it's implied that she's always had abilities but chose to hide these abilities  while the real Iris is present.\n\n====Animation====\n* Mirror Master appeared in ''[[Super Friends: The Legendary Super Powers Show]]'', voiced by [[James Avery (actor)|James Avery]]. The Flash doesn't appear in this episode. In the episode \"Reflections in Crime\", Mirror Master sets about trapping the Super Friends inside mirrors called the sixth dimension. The Super Friends managed to escape and trap Mirror Master in a House of Mirrors where he was apprehended upon being unable to find his way out.\n[[File:Mirror master jlu.jpg|200px|thumb|Mirror Master in ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]''.]]\n* An amalgamated version of Mirror Master appears in the ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' animated series and ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'', voiced by [[Alexis Denisof]]. In the episode \"Eclipsed\", an actor hired to play him is seen as part of the [[Wally West|Flash]]'s Lightspeed energy bar commercial. The actual version is an amalgamation of Sam Scudder and Evan McCulloch; he is clearly American like Scudder as well as being a simple criminal and not a hitman but his mirror abilities are tilted more towards McCulloch's enhanced, almost supernatural skills like a Mirror Dimension. In the episode \"Flash and Substance\", he seemed to act as the Rogues' de facto leader, convincing the others to exact revenge upon the Flash for repeatedly thwarting their plots and bringing them to jail, joining forces with Captain Boomerang, Captain Cold, and [[Trickster (comics)|Trickster]]. It was also mentioned by Captain Boomerang that the Flash made Mirror Master eat his own Laser-Kaleidoscope, though Mirror Master dismissed this as being false saying \"That's a rumor! A complete exaggeration. Besides, it was a laser pistol\". The Rogues later demolish the newly opened [[Flash Museum]] upon entering through [[Linda Park (comics)|Linda Park]]'s compact mirror. In his battle with Flash, [[Batman]], and [[Orion (comics)|Orion]], Mirror Master ended up trapped in the broken shards of the mirror after Batman's [[Batarang]] is thrown at one of the mirrors that Mirror Master used. Forensics were shown collecting the pieces of the mirror. Mirror Master had a cameo as a member of the Secret Society in the episode \"The Great Brain Robbery\".\n[[File:TB mirror master.jpg|180px|thumb|right|Mirror Master with his assistant Smoke on ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]''.]]\n* The Sam Scudder version of Mirror Master appeared in the fifth season of ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]'' animated series, voiced by and modeled after [[John Larroquette]]. This version is a brilliant but mad optical [[physics|physicist]] and is said to be the most powerful of the Flash's foes. In \"A Mirror Darkly\", he employed mirror versions of Batman, Flash, and [[Dick Grayson|Robin]] to steal components for his Mirror Portal Ray. He used it to trap Gotham's citizens in any reflective surface--[[mirror]]s, [[window]]s, even a [[silver]] serving tray. On a side note, he has a female assistant named Smoke (voiced by Amanda Anka). In \"Lost Heroes\", he fights Flash and [[Green Arrow]] in a circus fun house only for Green Arrow to cut off his reflection by a slime-emitting arrow.\n* The Evan McCulloch version of Mirror Master appears in ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'', voiced by [[Tom Kenny]]. He and [[Captain Cold]] are mentioned in \"The Golden Age of Justice\" as having been recently defeated by Batman. Mirror Master makes a non-speaking cameo in \"Requiem for a Scarlet Speedster\" where he traps Batman and [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]] in a trap only for Batman to cut him and Allen out of the trap and then for Flash to redirect a beam back to Mirror Master, supposedly knocking him out. In the anthology-only episode \"Four Star Spectacular!\" in the vignette \"Double Trouble\", Mirror Master traps the Flash using a mirror maze and attacks him with a horde of mirror duplicates. Flash eventually realizes which of the images is the one real Mirror Master and knocks him out.\n* Mirror Master appears in the ''[[Robot Chicken]]'' [[Robot Chicken DC Comics Special|DC Comics Special]], voiced by [[Breckin Meyer]]. He appears as a member of the [[Legion of Doom]]. In one segment, he and the [[Riddler]] pressure [[Sinestro]] to shave off his mustache in the bathroom, which leads to Sinestro gushing blood from his upper lip. Mirror Master escapes in a mirror in horror. He next appears in the final segment where he participates in the battle between the [[Justice League]] and the Legion of Doom.\n\n===Film===\n* The Sam Scudder version of Mirror Master appears as an antagonist in ''[[Justice League: Doom]]'' with [[Alexis Denisof]] reprising his role from the ''Justice League'' animated series. He is recruited into [[Vandal Savage]]'s [[Legion of Doom]] before the film's events begin. He sneaks into the [[Batcave]] using the [[Batmobile]]'s rear view mirror and steals [[Batman]]'s contingency plans from the [[Batcomputer]]. He is chosen by Savage to kill The [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Flash]]. Mirror Master gets Flash's attention by robbing a moving train and taking everyone aboard hostage. Flash manages to destroy all of his holograms, but Mirror Master manages to plant a bomb through Flash's wrist while disabling a bomb inside a glass box containing an old woman (actually another hologram). The bomb would go off in 60 seconds should Flash do nothing, try to take it off, and, should he run, if he decelerates. Flash eventually escapes by vibrating molecules though an iceberg, leaving the bomb trapped in the iceberg before it explodes. He toasts Savage at their victory celebration and signs on for his true, genocidal plan. When the Justice League storms the Hall of Doom, he fight The Flash by taking the battle outside and forcing Flash to fight a multitude of solid holograms and new holograms that seem to be made of glass. Eventually Flash takes out all of his holograms and knocks out Mirror Master in one punch.\n* Mirror Master appears in ''[[Justice League: The Flashpoint Paradox]]'' in a non-speaking role. In the film's beginning, he and the Rogues are attacking the Flash, but [[Eobard Thawne|Professor Zoom]] betrays the Rogues and attaches bombs to the Rogues which cannot be removed. When the Justice League arrive and manage to dispose the bombs, [[Hal Jordan|Green Lantern]] takes Mirror Master to space's upper limits where Green Lantern's ring is shielding while Batman uses a laser cutter to remove the bomb which later drops in space from the bomb radius, saving Mirror Master's life. His appearance is notable because his physical body is noticeably bulkier than previous animated incarnations; it is unknown whether this is due to muscle, bone structure, or body fat.\n* In ''[[Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths]]'', an alternate version of [[Lex Luthor]] mentions Mirror Master being head of the police.\n\n===Video games===\n* The Evan McCulloch incarnation of Mirror Master appears in ''[[DC Universe Online]]'', voiced by Brandon Young.\n* Mirror Master makes a cameo appearance in ''[[Injustice: Gods Among Us]]''. In Raven's ending, Mirror Master was seen holding Superman's parents hostage.\n* Mirror Master is mentioned in ''[[Injustice 2]]'' by Cheetah and Captain Cold, the latter of whom betrayed Mirror Master despite Mirror Master having \"leverage\" on Superman. It is unrevealed whether Mirror Master is dead or simply imprisoned.\n* The Evan McCulloch version of Mirror Master appears as a playable character in ''[[Lego DC Super-Villains]]'', voiced by [[Sam Heughan]].\n\n===Music===\n* There is a reference to Mirror Master in the [[Ookla the Mok (band)|Ookla the Mok]] song \"Stranger In The Mirror\". He is referred to in the song lyrics as \"the villain in issue 104 of The Flash,\" though Mirror Master actually debuted in issue 105.\n\n===Miscellaneous===\n* Mirror Master appeared in issue #23 of the ''Super Friends'' spin-off comic book.\n* Mirror Master appeared in issue #12 of the ''Justice League Unlimited'' spin-off comic book.\n* Mirror Master appeared in issue #16 of the ''Batman: The Brave and The Bold'' comic book.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://arrow.wikia.com/wiki/Sam_Scudder Arrowverse entry for Mirror Master I]\n* [http://arrow.wikia.com/wiki/Evan_McCulloch Arrowverse entry for Mirror Master II]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060323061226/http://www.monitorduty.com/mdarchives/2005/12/alan_kistlers_p_3.shtml Alan Kistler's Profile On: THE FLASH] - A detailed analysis of the history of the Flash by comic book historian Alan Kistler.

[[State school|Public schools]] and [[private school]]s have both been present. Modern reforms to education began in the late 19th century. Since its early history, Korean education has been influenced significantly by Confucian values particularly in its emphasis of formal learning and scholarship through China more than fifteen centuries ago. Confucianism instilled facilities like governance of men by merit, social mobility through education, and the civil examination system based on the system that was developed in China during the Tang Dynasty. As a result, written word and mastery of Chinese classics and literacy became the primary method in choosing individuals for bureaucratic positions, gaining them a respective social status and privileges.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Education Fever: Society, Politics, And The Pursuit of Schooling in South Korea|last=Seth|first=Michael J.|publisher=Hawai'i Studies on Korea|year=2002|isbn=0-8248-2534-9|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\nThe Chosun period was significant in shaping the dynamics and foundation of the Korean education system in that it established schools that ingrained loyalty, orthodoxy, and motivation for official recruitment into its students. The primary means to receive an education during the Chosun period were through village schools (sodang; sojae) and through private tutoring. The sodang was the most common method of formal education in Korea until the late twentieth century, and was usually available only to a handful of neighborhood boys starting at around age seven. In the middle of the sixteenth century, however, the role of official schools gradually declined with the emergence of private academies (sowon), which usually functioned as rural retreats and centers of learning until the majority of them were closed in the 1870s in an effort to centralize authority.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nPreparing students for competitive examinations were pronounced during the Chosun era as a means of social mobility and selection of official positions, and remained a basic tenet in Korean education throughout its history. However, this extreme emphasis on education and meritocracy was contrasted by hereditary aristocracy during the Chosun period, where bloodlines and kinship were particularly pronounced. Due to Confucian influences, however, education was able to maintain a fairly equalizing presence over society because of its belief in each individual being capable of benefitting from formal education and achieving enlightenment. Education was also dominated by the exalted scholar-teacher relationship, where teachers held almost a sacred status and were seen as a principal source of ethical counsel. This convention also engendered the tradition of ''remonstrance'', which obligated the scholar to criticize the actions of the government and even the king in order to avoid threatening the Confucian-inspired concept of the moral order of the universe.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe dynastic period did not prioritize special or technical training, and thus a preference for a non-specialized and literary education has remained in Korea. Many of these developments were pronounced towards the end of the 19<sup>th</sup> century when the Chosun dynasty began implementing a Western-style education system as a result of the intrusion of foreign powers into Korea. By 1904, public education was largely confined to Seoul, which was generally resisted by the public as well as government officials. This maintained the dominance of sodang and other traditional institutions as the primary means to receive a formal education. However, as a result of financial support from members of the royal family and American missionary activities and schools, the number of schools began to increase in the early 1900s. As a means to promote basic literacy among its citizens, Korea also introduced mixed script of Hangeul and Chinese characters into its instruction.<ref name=\":0\" /> \n\nDuring the Japanese occupation (1905-1945), Korea was able to establish a comprehensive and modern system of national education through centralization and deliberate planning of integrating Japanese occupational professionalism and values. However, there were severe restrictions like the lack of access to education beyond the elementary level for Koreans and the manipulation of education to indoctrinate Korean subjects to be loyal to the Japanese empire, which led to turmoil and discontent among Koreans who were forced to assimilate. The Japanese emphasized low-level and non-professional track schooling for Koreans which was pronounced by the Educational Ordinance of 1911, where Japanese residents had fourteen years of schooling available while Koreans only had eight years available to them, unless they were civil servants wherein eleven was the maximum. Schooling was primarily based on Japanese values, literacy, and history as an attempt to make young Koreans loyal to the Japanese state and indirectly wipe out Korean culture and history. As a minor development, the Educational Ordinance of 1922 was enacted, which reopened the Seoul Teachers' School, extended elementary and secondary education, and added college preparatory or advanced technical training to the curriculum.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nHigher education became a central issue for upper-class and upwardly mobile Koreans, who were provided very limited access to these institutions as well as positions of administration and teaching. Furthermore, with the introduction of the Educational Ordinance of 1938, Korean schools were to be identical to Japanese ones in organization and curriculum, which made education a highly militarized and regimented tool for forced assimilation and militarization.<ref name=\":0\" /> These last few years of Japanese rule pronounced the discontent of Koreans whose social and political climates had been deeply affected.\n\n===Post-war years===\nAfter [[Gwangbokjeol]] and the liberation from Japan, the Korean government began to study and discuss for a new [[philosophy of education]]. The new educational philosophy was created under the [[United States Army Military Government in Korea]](USAMGIK) with a focus on [[democratic education]]. The new system attempted to make education available to all students equally and promote the educational administration to be more self-governing. It also emphasized a decentralized education which local and community control in order to maintain educational autonomy from authoritarian policies. Specific policies included: re-educating [[teacher]]s, lowering [[functional illiteracy]] by educating adults, restoration of the [[Korean language]] for [[technical terminology]], and expansion of various educational institutions.<ref name=\"EncyKorea\">{{cite web |url=http://encykorea.aks.ac.kr/Contents/Index?contents_id=E0005524 |script-title=ko:?? |publisher=[[Academy of Korean Studies]] |work=Encyclopedia of Korean Culture |accessdate=January 22, 2014 |language=Korean |trans-title=Education}}</ref> This system did not instigate radical change, however, to the extent that it maintained the centralized and authoritarian administration created by the Japanese with no meaningful changes. It did, however, abet in the Koreanization of South Korean education through the initiative of Korean leaders by promoting Hangeul, removing Japanese instruction practices, and emphasizing Korean history, geography, and literature. Aside from these developments, the most striking feature of the U.S. military occupation was the significant expansion of schooling and the student population.\n\nFollowing the [[Korean War]], the government of Syngman Rhee reversed many of these reforms after 1948, when only primary schools remained in most cases coeducational and, because of a lack of resources, education was compulsory only up to the sixth grade. In 1948, the prevalent debate in South Korean education was whether to maintain an elitist multitrack path based on the prewar Japanese colonial model, or adopt an open American system that avoided early tracking and did not terminalize primary or secondary education.\n\nDuring the years when Rhee and [[Park Chung Hee]] were in power, the control of education was gradually taken out of the hands of local school boards and concentrated in a centralized Ministry of Education. In the late 1980s, the ministry was responsible for administration of schools, allocation of resources, setting of enrollment quotas, certification of schools and teachers, curriculum development (including the issuance of textbook guidelines), and other basic policy decisions. Provincial and special city boards of education still existed. Although each board was composed of seven members who were supposed to be selected by popularly elected legislative bodies, this arrangement ceased to function after 1973. Subsequently, school board members were approved by the minister of education. In high school they would call it year one grade (9th grader) and year 2 would be (10th grader) and so on. Therefore, a multitrack and single secondary school system prevailed, largely due to the fact that administrators did not want to divide institutions, and parents were not receptive to the idea of two entrance exams''.'' The outcome the 1950 MOE proposal for a uniform system was a 6-4-3-4 academic schedule, which entailed 6 years of primary school, 4 years of middle school, 3 years of vocational or academic high school, and 4 years of college or university. A complex system of technical and vocational training was also added to educational policy, where children were able to decide on an academic versus a vocational route early on in their academic career. Many opposers of this policy actually viewed it as positive because they believed that the academic route would seem more prolific and parents and students would be willing to pursue it more than the vocational route. Furthermore, even though a few local school boards were established toward the late 1940s, they were not appreciated by many Koreans because there was a widespread notion that a uniform and centrally controlled system is best. A rigorous and uniform national curriculum was established in the mid-1950s and there were significant efforts to make school accessible for everyone, especially in the context of Rhee's declaration of compulsory universal literacy and basic education. While universal basic education eliminated disparities between classes, competition became very fierce due to restricted entry into higher academic tiers, which contributed to the predominant \"education fever\" that is still prevalent in South Korea.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn the 1960s, there was a difficulty in harnessing the demand for education towards the needs of an industrializing economy, which caused a growth in private foundations in order to supply the public demand for schooling. Furthermore, the 60s and 70s were characterized by a large demand to direct educational development to economic development, which necessitated a greater emphasis on vocational and technical training rather than academic training in order to help citizens gain skills that would supply the country's economic needs. Even though there were major criticisms on behalf of the public for this emphasis on vocational training due to a clashing with Confucian values, the state continued to strengthen vocational education, especially after the shift in industrialization to heavy chemical and machine industries in the 70s. The 1960s and 70s experienced turmoil in education systems due to public resistance and the uncooperativeness of private schools with the state as they attempted to supply public demand. While the state was able to fulfill many of its economic goals, it came at a great social and political cost like the depopulation of rural areas and President Park's assassination <ref name=\":0\" />. \n\nMost observers agree that South Korea's spectacular progress in modernization and economic growth since the [[Korean War]] is largely attributable to the willingness of individuals to invest a large amount of resources in education: the improvement of \"human capital.\" The traditional esteem for the educated man, now extends to scientists, technicians, and others working with specialized knowledge. Highly educated technocrats and economic planners could claim much of the credit for their country's economic successes since the 1960s. Scientific professions were generally regarded as the most prestigious by South Koreans in the 1980s.\n\nStatistics demonstrate the success of South Korea's national education programs. In 1945 the adult literacy rate was estimated at 22 percent; by 1970 adult literacy was 87.6 percent<ref name=\"William Shaw 1990\">Andrea Matles Savada and William Shaw, editors. ''South Korea: A Country Study''. Washington: GPO for the Library of Congress, 1990.</ref> and, by the late 1980s, sources estimated it at around 93 percent.<ref name=\"William Shaw 1990\"/> Although only primary school (grades one through six) was compulsory, percentages of age-groups of children and young people enrolled in secondary level schools were equivalent to those found in industrialized countries, including Japan. Approximately 4.8 million students in the eligible age-group were attending primary school in 1985. The percentage of students going on to optional middle school the same year was more than 99 percent. Approximately 34 percent, one of the world's highest rates of secondary-school graduates attended institutions of higher education in 1987, a rate similar to Japan's (about 30 percent) and exceeding Britain's (20 percent).\n\nGovernment expenditure on education has been generous. In 1975, it was 220 billion [[South Korean won|won]],<ref name=\"William Shaw 1990\"/> the equivalent of 2.2 percent of the gross national product, or 13.9 percent of total government expenditure. By 1986, education expenditure had reached 3.76 trillion [[South Korean won|won]], or 4.5 percent of the GNP, and 27.3 percent of government budget allocations.\n\nThe 1980s and 90s marked an era of democratization and economic prosperity in South Korea, partly due to the \"education fever\". In 1991, for the first time in thirty years, the country elected provincial and city councils in order to localize education, and leaders like Kim Young Sam and Kim Dae Jung were able to enact major overhauls to the education system in order to accommodate democratization through methods like abolishing on-campus ROTCS training and political mobilization of students, legalization of teacher unions, and removing anti-Communist texts<ref name=\":0\" />. The MOE began to shift away from a uniform curriculum by allowing school boards to implement some minor variations in instructional content. Literacy became virtually universal in South Korea while it rose up in international ranks in math and science, especially. \n\nDespite South Korea's transition to democracy, traditional and Confucian values remained very strong. Overall, the huge strides in educational development came at the cost of intense pressure among students, high suicide rates, and family financial struggles through investment in schooling and private tutoring. \n\n===Student activism===\nStudent activism has a long and honorable history in Korea. Students in [[Joseon]] secondary schools often became involved in the intense factional struggles of the scholar-official class. Students played a major role in Korea's independence movement, particularly in March 1, 1919, which was a protest based on students' growing resentment towards restrictive, discriminatory, and hostile Japanese occupation and instruction practices. Students were also heavily involved in repeated national efforts and demonstrations against Japanese policies, with instances like the Gwangju Student Movement in 1929 and the June 10, 1926 funeral line protest. \n\nStudents protested against the regimes of [[Syngman Rhee]] and [[Park Chung-hee]] during the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s. Observers noted, however, that while student activists in the past generally embraced liberal and democratic values, the new generation of militants in the 1980s were far more radical. Most participants adopted some version of the [[minjung]] ideology but was also animated by strong feelings of popular [[nationalism]] and [[xenophobia]].\n\nOne of the most extreme and landmark movements was the Kwangju Massacre in 1980, where students were driven by a strong will to rebel through Marxist influences against the martial law government. This radicalism was paralleled by the communist sympathizing and radicalism of students in the 1940s and 50s as a result of American occupation.\n\nThe most militant university students, perhaps about 5 percent of the total enrollment at [[Seoul National University]] and comparable figures at other institutions in the [[Seoul|capital]] during the late 1980s, were organized into small circles or cells rarely containing more than fifty members. Police estimated that there were 72 such organizations of varying orientation, having the change of curriculum and education system of South Korea people have been enriched in an imaginary way that makes them propel in all their studies.\n\n===Reforms in the 1980s===\nFollowing the assumption of power by General [[Chun Doo-hwan]] in 1980, the Ministry of Education implemented a number of reforms designed to make the system more fair and to increase higher education opportunities for the population at large. In a very popular move, the ministry dramatically increased enrollment at large.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nSocial emphasis on education was not without its problems, as it tended to accentuate class differences. In the late 1980s, a college degree was considered necessary for entering the middle class; there were no alternative pathways of social advancement, with the possible exception of a military career, outside higher education. People without a college education, including skilled workers with vocational school backgrounds, often were treated as second-class citizens by their white-collar, college-educated managers, despite the importance of their skills for economic development. Intense competition for places at the most prestigious universities\u2014the sole gateway into elite circles\u2014promoted, like the old Confucian system, a sterile emphasis on rote memorization in order to pass secondary school and college entrance examinations. Particularly after a dramatic expansion of college enrollments in the early 1980s, South Korea faced the problem of what to do about a large number of young people staying in school for a long time, usually at great sacrifice to themselves and their families, and then faced with limited job opportunities because their skills were not marketable.\n\n===Great recession===\nWith a slowing economy, a rigid and fast-changing job market as a result of the [[Financial crisis of 2007\u201308]] and the demise of the [[Industrial Age]], many young South Korean high school graduates are now realizing that high entrance examination and test scores for the promise of future career success did not carry the same weight as it once did.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/07/world/asia/07pride.html |title=With Wounded Pride, Unemployed Koreans Quietly Turn to Manual Labor |last=FACKLER |first=MARTIN  |date=July 6, 2009}}</ref> In 2013, 43,000 South Koreans in their twenties, and 21,000 in their thirties lost their jobs.<ref name=ICEF>{{cite web |url=http://monitor.icef.com/2014/01/high-performance-high-pressure-in-south-koreas-education-system/ |title=High performance, high pressure in South Korea's education system |publisher=ICEF Monitor |date=23 January 2014 |accessdate=29 May 2016}}</ref> According to a 2013 survey conducted by the Korea Research Institute for Vocational Education and Training, nearly four out of every 10 young workers in their 20s and 30s said they were overeducated.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.saveourschools.com.au/national-issues/south-korea-education-success-has-a-dark-side |title=Fighting for Equity in Education |date=November 24, 2013 |access-date=December 5, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161118102555/http://www.saveourschools.com.au/national-issues/south-korea-education-success-has-a-dark-side |archive-date=November 18, 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name=\"Stratfor\">{{cite web |url=https://www.stratfor.com/analysis/south-korea-votes-changing-region |title=South Korea Votes in a Changing Region |date=April 13, 2016 |publisher=Stratfor}}</ref> In 2013, fewer young South Koreans chose go on to university after finishing high school as the unemployment rate for university graduates continues to soar, falling income for college graduates continues to decline and the value of a college degree has now becoming increasingly in doubt.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2013/09/07/2013090700379.html |title=Fewer Young People Go On to University |publisher=The Chosun |accessdate=29 May 2016}}</ref> Educational reforms initiated by the South Korean government have become more dynamic and that university is no longer the only guarantee of a career.<ref name=\"Ng Jing Yng 1\">{{cite web | url=http://www.todayonline.com/world/asia/revamped-vocational-education-may-have-prevented-graduate-glut-ex-korean-minister?page=1 | title=Earlier introduction of vocational education 'could have prevented' S Korea's grad glut | publisher=Today | date=24 July 2015 | accessdate=2 October 2016 | author=Ng Jing Yng}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://english.donga.com/List/3/all/26/404739/1 | title=Meister of job placement | publisher=The Dong-A-Ilbo | date=22 September 2012 | accessdate=14 October 2016}}</ref> Government measures have also been prompted to encourage young unemployed college graduates to look at other employment possibilities such as starting a business or seeking employment opportunities at smaller and medium size businesses.<ref name=\"The Korea Herald\">{{cite web | url=http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20091116000035 | title=Lee urges job seekers to look for opportunities at smaller companies | publisher=The Korea Herald | date=30 March 2010 | accessdate=26 October 2016}}</ref> Former President [[Lee Myung-Bak]] urged young unemployed job seekers to start looking at other employment possibilities with small and medium-sized businesses beyond large conglomerates.<ref name=\"The Korea Herald\"/><ref>{{cite web | url=http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2016/09/01/2016090101665.html | title=Young Jobseekers Must Look Beyond Big Business | publisher=The Chosun llbo | date=1 September 2016 | accessdate=26 October 2016}}</ref>\n\nAn oversaturated and overqualified labor market has resulted in shortages of skilled blue-collar labor and a lack of qualified vocational employees for small and medium-sized businesses, young South Koreans now realize that a college degree no longer guarantees a job as it once did.<ref name=\"Ng Jing Yng 1\"/> With the nation's high university entrance rate, South Korea has produced an overeducated and underemployed labor force with many being unable find employment at the level of their education qualifications.

Many students in Korea start kindergarten at the Western age of three and will, therefore, continue to study in kindergarten for three or four years, before starting their 'formal education' in 'grade one' of primary school. Many private kindergartens offer their classes in English to give students a 'head-start' in the mandatory English education they would receive later in public school. Kindergartens often pay homage to the expectations of parents with impressive courses, graduation ceremonies, complete with diplomas and gowns. Korean kindergartens are expected to start teaching basic maths, reading and writing to children, including education on how to count, add, subtract, and read and write in Korean, and often in English and Chinese. Children in Korean kindergartens are also taught using games focused on education and coordination, such as \"playing doctor\" to teach body parts, food and nutrition, and work positions for adults. Songs, dances, and memorization are a big part of Korean kindergarten education.\n\n==Primary education==\n[[Elementary schools]] ({{lang-ko|\ucd08\ub4f1 \ud559\uad50, ????}}, ''chodeung hakgyo'') consists of grades [[First grade|one]] to [[sixth grade|six]] (age 8 to age 13 in [[East Asian age reckoning|Korean years]]\u20147 to 12 in western years). The South Korean government changed its name to the current form from ''Citizens' school'' ({{lang-ko|\uad6d\ubbfc \ud559\uad50, ????}}, ''Gukmin hakgyo'') in 1996. The former name was shortened from \ud669\uad6d \uc2e0\ubbfc \ud559\uad50, ??????  (''Hwangguk sinmin hakgyo''), which means ''school of the people who are subjects of the Empire (of Japan)''.\n\nIn [[elementary school]], students learn the following subjects.  The curriculum differs from grades 1-2 to grades 3-6.<ref>[[:ko:????? ????]]</ref>\n\n'''Grades 1\u20132:'''\n*''We Are First Graders'' ({{lang-ko|1\ud559\ub144 1??}}) (grade 1 only)\n*Korean (listening, speaking, reading, writing)\n*[[Mathematics]]\n*''Disciplined Life'' ({{lang-ko|????}})\n*''Sensible Life'' ({{lang-ko|??????}})\n*''Enjoyable Life'' ({{lang-ko|?????}})\n*Above three changed a few years ago into \"Spring(\ubd04,Bom)\",\"Summer(\uc5ec\ub984,Yeo-Reum)\",\"Fall(\uac00\uc744,Ga-eul)\",\"Winter(\uaca8\uc6b8,Gyeo-Ul)\"\n*[[Physical Education]]\n\n'''Grades 3\u20136:'''\n*Korean (listening, speaking, reading, writing)\n*[[English as a second or foreign language|English]]\n*[[Character education|Moral Education]]\n*[[Social Studies]]\n*[[Mathematics]]\n*[[Science]]\n*[[Art]]\n*[[Music]]\n*Practical Arts\n*[[Physical Education]]\n\nUsually, the class teacher covers most of the subjects; however, there are some specialised teachers in professions such as physical education and [[foreign language]]s, including [[English as a second or foreign language|English]].\n\nThose who wish to become a primary school teacher must major in primary education, which is specially designed to cultivate primary school teachers. In Korea, most of the primary teachers are working for public primary schools.\n\nBecause corporal punishment has been officially and legally prohibited in every classroom since 2011, many teachers and some parents raised with corporal punishment are becoming more concerned about what they see as worsening discipline problems. Some teachers continue to use corporal punishment discreetly.<ref>{{cite news |first=Jeyup S. |last=Kwaak |title=Extreme Corporal Punishment Case in Seoul School Sparks Debate |work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |date=28 June 2014 |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/korearealtime/2014/06/28/extreme-corporal-punishment-case-in-seoul-school-sparks-debate/}}</ref>\n\n==Secondary education==\nIn 1987, there were approximately 4,895,354 students enrolled in middle schools and high schools, with approximately 150,873 teachers.

Given the importance of entry into higher education, the majority of students attended general or academic high schools in 1987: 1,397,359 students, or 60 percent of the total, attended general or academic high schools, as compared with 840,265 students in vocational secondary schools. Vocational schools specialized in a number of fields: primarily agriculture, fishery, commerce, trades, merchant marine, engineering, and the arts.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}\n\nCompetitive entrance examinations at the middle-school level were abolished in 1968. Although as of the late 1980s, students still had to pass noncompetitive qualifying examinations, they were assigned to secondary institutions by lottery, or else by location within the boundary of the school district. Secondary schools, formerly ranked according to the quality of their students, have been equalized, with a portion of good, mediocre, and poor students being assigned to each one. The reform, however, did not equalize secondary schools completely. In Seoul, students who performed well in qualifying examinations were allowed to attend better quality schools in a \"common\" district, while other students attended schools in one of five geographical districts. The reforms applied equally to public and private schools whose enrollments were strictly controlled by the Ministry of Education.\n\nIn South Korea, the grade of a student is reset as the student progresses through elementary, middle and high school. To differentiate the grades between students, one would often state the grade based on the level of education he/she is in. For example, a student in the first year of middle school would be referred to as \"First grade in Middle School (\uc911\ud559\uad50 1\ud559\ub144.)\".\n\nMiddle schools are called ''Jung hakgyo'' (\uc911\ud559\uad50) in Korean, which literally means ''middle school''. High schools are called ''Godeung hakgyo'' (\uace0\ub4f1\ud559\uad50) in Korean, literally meaning \"high school\".\n\n===Middle school===\n[[Middle schools]] in South Korea consist of three grades. Most students enter at age 12 or 13 and graduate at age 15 or 16 (western years). These three grades correspond roughly to grades 7\u20139 in the North American system and Years 8\u201311 in the [[Education in England|English]] and [[Education in Wales|Welsh]] system.\n\nMiddle school in South Korea marks a considerable shift from primary school, with students expected to take studies and school much more seriously. At most middle schools regulation uniforms and haircuts are enforced fairly strictly, and some aspects of students' lives are highly controlled. Like in primary school, students spend most of the day in the same homeroom classroom with the same classmates; however, students have different teachers for each subject. Teachers move around from classroom to classroom, and few teachers apart from those who teach special subjects have their own rooms to which students come. Homeroom teachers (\ub2f4\uc784 \uad50\uc0ac, [[Revised Romanization of Korean|RR]]: ''damim gyosa'') play a very important role in students' lives.\n\nMost middle school students take seven lessons a day, and in addition to this usually have an early morning block that precedes regular lessons and an eighth lesson specializing in an extra subject to finish the day. Unlike with high school, middle school curricula do not vary much from school to school. Korean, Algebra, Geometry, English, social studies, and science form the core subjects, with students also receiving instruction in [[music]], [[art]], PE, [[korean history]], [[ethics]], [[home economics]], secondary language, technology, and [[Hanja]]. What subjects students study and in what amount may vary from year to year. All regular lessons are 45 minutes long. Before school, students have an extra block, 30-or-more minutes long, that may be used for self-study, watching Educational Broadcast System (EBS) broadcasts, or for personal or class administration. Beginning in 2008, students attended school from Monday to Friday, and had a half-day every 1st, 3rd, and 5th (calendar permitting) Saturday of the month. Saturday lessons usually included Club Activity (CA) lessons, where students could participate in extracurricular activities. However, these classes were also not used well either. Many schools have regular classes except having extracurricular activities because schools and parents want students to study more. However, from 2012 onwards, primary and secondary schools, including middle schools, will no longer hold Saturday classes. However, still many schools have Saturday classes illegally because the parents want their children to go to school and study.<ref name=\"Thomaswhite.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.thomaswhite.com/world-markets/south-korea-an-end-to-saturday-classes/ |title=South Korea: An end to Saturday classes &#124; Thomas White International |publisher=Thomaswhite.com |date=2011-09-26}}</ref>\n\nIn 1969, the government abolished entrance examinations for middle school students, replacing it with a system whereby primary school students within the same district are selected for middle schools by a lottery system. This has the effect of equalizing the quality of students from school to school, though schools in areas where students come from more privileged backgrounds still tend to outperform schools in poorer areas. Until recently most middle schools have been same-sex, though in the past decade most new middle schools have been mixed, and some previously same-sex schools have converted to mixed as well. Some schools have converted to same-sex due to pressure from parents who thought that their children would study better in [[single-sex education]].\n\nAs with primary schools, students pass from grade to grade regardless of knowledge or academic achievement, the result being that classes often have students of vastly differing abilities learning the same subject material together. In the final year of middle school examination scores become very important for the top students hoping to gain entrance into the top high schools, and for those in the middle hoping to get into an academic rather than a technical or vocational high school. Otherwise, examinations and marks only matter insofar as living up to a self-enforced concept of position in the school ranking system. There are some standardized examinations for certain subjects, and teachers of academic subjects are expected to follow approved textbooks, but generally middle school teachers have more flexibility over curricula and methods than teachers at high school.\n\nMore than 95% of the middle school students also attend independent owned, after-school tutoring agencies known as ''Hagwon'', or \"cram schools\", in order to receive extra instruction from private tutors. The core subjects, especially the cumulative subjects of Korean, English and math, receive the most emphasis. Some ''Hagwon'' specializing in just one subject, and others offer all core subjects, constituting a second round of schooling every day for their pupils. Indeed, some parents place more stress on their children's ''Hagwon'' studies than their public school studies. Additionally, many students attend academies for things such as martial arts or music. The result of all this is that many middle school students, like their high school counterparts, return from a day of schooling well after sunset. The average South Korean family spends 20% percent of its income on after-hours cram schools, more spending per capita on private tutoring than any other country.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/education-jan-june11-koreaschools_01-21/ | title=In Hypercompetitive South Korea, Pressures Mount on Young Pupils | publisher=PBS | date=21 January 2011 | accessdate=28 October 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.ft.com/content/7bd4a52a-3b06-11e3-a7ec-00144feab7de | title=Education in South Korea: system must change to satisfy country's and pupils' needs | publisher=Financial Times | date=5 November 2013 | accessdate=28 October 2016 | author=Song Jung-a}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://spectator.sme.sk/c/20051653/seeing-the-shared-traits.html | title=Seeing the shared traits | publisher=The Slovak Spectator | accessdate=28 October 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | title=On My Own: Korean Businesses and Race Relations in America | publisher=University of Chicago Press. | author=In-Jin Yoon | year=1997 | page=78}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.arirang.co.kr/news/News_View.asp?nseq=146856 | title=Korean parents spending most of income on children's education | publisher=Arirang News | date=7 May 2013 | accessdate=28 October 2016}}</ref>\n\n===High school===\n[[High school]]s in South Korea teach students for three years, from first grade (age 15\u201317) to third grade (age 17\u201319), and students commonly graduate at age 18 or 19. High school students are commonly expected to study increasingly long hours each year moving toward graduation, to become competitive and be able to enter attractive universities in Korea that almost all parents and teachers want students to enter. Many high school students wake and leave home in the morning at 5{{nbsp}}am. When the school is over at 4 pm, they go to a studying room in the school or to a library to study instead of going home. This is called 'Yaja', which literally means 'evening self-study'. They don't need to go home to eat dinner since most schools provide paid dinner for students. After finishing yaja (usually ends at 11:00 pm, but later than 12:00 am at some schools), they return home after studying, then return to specialty study schools (which are called [[Hagwon]]) often till 3{{nbsp}}am, from Monday to Friday. In addition, they often study on weekends.\n\nThe Yaja had not been really 'self' study for more than 30 years; all high school students were forced to do it. From the 2010s, the Ministry of Education has encouraged high schools to free students of yaja and to allow them do it whenever they want, and many normal public high schools near Seoul are now no longer forcing students do it. But private high schools, special-purpose high schools (such as science high schools, foreign language high schools), or normal schools far from Seoul are still forcing students to do yaja.\n\nIt is a commonly known saying in Korea that 'If you sleep three hours a night, you may get into a top 'SKY university;(National Seoul University,Yeonse Unibersity, Korean University)' If you sleep four hours each night, you may get into another university; if you sleep five or more hours each night, especially in your last year of high school, forget about getting into any university.'. Accordingly, many high school students in their final year do not have any free time for holidays, birthdays or vacations before the CSATs (College Scholastic Ability Test, Korean: \uc218\ub2a5,Suneung), which are university entrance exams held by the Ministry of Education. Surprisingly, some high school students are offered chances to travel with family to enjoy fun and relaxing vacations, but these offers are often refused on the first suggestion by the students themselves, and increasingly on later additional trips if any, due to peer influences and a fear of 'falling behind' in classes. Many high school students seem to prefer staying with friends and studying, rather than taking a break. The idea of 'skipping classes' for fun is extremely rare in Korea. Rebellious students will often stay in class and use smartphones connected to the internet to chat with friends behind the teacher's back during classes.\n\nHigh schools in Korea can be divided into specialty tracks that accord with a student's interest and career path or a normal - state high school. For special high schools, there are science ([[Seoul Science High School|Science high school]]), foreign language, international and art specialty high schools to which students can attend by passing entrance examinations which are generally highly competitive. These schools are called special-purpose high schools. And there are autonomous private high schools, which are relatively free of the policy of the Ministry of Education. Also, there are schools for gifted students. Tuition of many special-purpose high schools, autonomous private high schools, and schools for gifted students are highly expensive (the average of tuition of special-purpose or autonomous private high school is US$5,614 per year.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.hani.co.kr/arti/society/schooling/377928.html|title=???\u00b7??? ?? ?? 603??|date=2009-09-21|access-date=2018-03-27|language=ko}}</ref> One of schools for gifted students is US$7,858 per year<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://m.khan.co.kr/view.html?artid=201702061142001&code=940100&med_id=khan|title=?????? ?? ?? 1200??\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7?? ?????? ??|date=2017-02-06|access-date=2018-03-27|language=ko}}</ref>). There are few schools that require more than what's calculated in the article as an average, CheongShim International Academy, Hankuk Academy of Foreign studies, Korean Minjok Leadership Academy, Ha-Na academy are known for their expensive tuition, But at the same time, these schools are also known for its students high academic achievements and college results mostly sending more than 50% of their students to SKY university yearly. Other types of high schools include public normal high schools and private normal high schools, both with or without entrance examinations. These high schools do not report to specialize in a field but are more focused on sending their students to top and popular colleges.\n\nHowever, since the appearance of special-purpose, autonomous private and international schools and schools for gifted students, almost every normal high school have sent few students to ''top and popular'' college. Because those schools' infrastructure, teaching ability of teachers, and other activities provided by them which improves students' school record ''so that they can enter top colleges'' were absolutely better than normal schools' ones. This means those schools won the competition of sending students to universities; if you are normal high school student, it's hard to enter SKY. So excellent students and their parents avoid to enter normal high school and tried to enter special-purpose, autonomous private, and schools for gifted students. Therefore, only students whose grade is normal or too low to enter vocational school entered normal high school. Then excellent students avoid entering the normal high schools because the academic level of students in normal school is low. This vicious cycle continued, and normal schools got ''slumisim'' so the cycle got even more vicious. As a result, since the admission committee of top universities don't like to admit students from normal schools which got slum, they started to prefer to admit students from special-purpose, autonomous private, or international schools or schools from gifted students mainly. So the cycle got worse. This made the competition of entering special-purpose, autonomous private, and international schools and schools for gifted students so hard that the competition got as hard as one of entering top colleges.\n\nOn noting the schedule of many high school students, it is not unusual for them to arrive home from school at midnight or even as late as 3{{nbsp}}am after intensive \"self-study\" sessions supported by the school or parents. The Korean government has tried to crack down on such damaging study habits in order to allow a more balanced system, mostly by fining many privately run specialty study institutes ([[Hagwon]]) for running classes as late (or as early) as 2{{nbsp}}am. To solve this problem, the Korean government made a law that bans hagwons from running classes after 10:00 pm, which is often not conformed to. Some such institutes also offer early morning classes for students to attend before going to school in the morning.\n\nThe normal government school curriculum is often noted as rigorous, with as many as 16 or so subjects. Most students choose to also attend privately run profit-making institutes known as [[hagwon]] (??, Korean: \ud559\uc6d0) to boost their academic performance. Core subjects include Korean, English and mathematics, with adequate emphasis on social and physical science subjects. Students do not typically ask questions in the classroom, but prefer to memorise details. It is critical to note that the type and level of subjects may differ from school to school, depending on the degree of selectivity and specialisation of the school. Specialty, optional, expensive, study schools help students memorise questions and answers from previous years' CAT tests (since August 1993) and universities' interview questions.\n\nHigh school is not [[mandatory education|mandatory]], unlike middle school education in Korea. However, according to a 2005 study of [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) member countries, some 97% of South Korea's young adults do complete high school. This was the highest percentage recorded in any country.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/education/4240668.stm |title=South Korea's education success |work=[[BBC News]] |date=13 September 2005}}</ref> However, this is mainly due to the fact that there is no such thing as a failing grade in Korea, and most graduate as long as they attend school a certain number of days.\n\nAs it stands, the Korean secondary system of education is highly successful in preparing students for teacher-centered education such as that often used to teach mathematics since the transfer of information is mostly one way, from teacher to student. However, this does not hold true for classroom environments where students are expected to take on self-reliant roles wherein, for the most part, active and creative personalities seem to lead to success.<ref name=\"one\">{{cite report |last=Jambor |first=Zoltan Paul |title=Favourable Teaching Approaches in the South Korean Post Secondary Classroom |publisher=[[Education Resources Information Center]], [[United States Department of Education]] |date=26 November 2009 |url=http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED507310.pdf}}</ref>\n\nIt is becoming ever more evident that active student use of the English language in Korean high schools is increasingly necessary for the purposes of helping the students enter top universities in Korea as well as abroad.<ref>{{cite report |last=Jambor |first=Paul Z. |title=English Language Necessity: What It means for Korea and Non-English Speaking Countries |publisher=Education Resources Information Center, United States Department of Education |date=January 2012 |url=http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED528279.pdf}}</ref>\n\n===Vocational===\nSouth Korea once had a strong vocational education system that it rebuilt its shattered economy after the [[Korean War]].

In vocational high schools, student spend half of the time on general courses along with vocational courses as the other half.

Agricultural high schools have a focus on scientific farming and is designed to produce skilled experts in agriculture while fishery and oceanography high schools utilize maritime resource to focus on navigation technology. Since the 1980s, vocational high schools have offered training in various fields to create a labor force that can adjust to the changes across South Korean industry and society. Due to needs of manpower across the heavy and chemical industries in the 1970s. the need for vocational education was crucial. By the 1980s. due the great changes in technology, the objective of vocational education was to create a supply of well trained technicians.  When graduates of vocational high schools are done, the student receives a vocational high school diploma and may choose to enter the workforce or go on to higher education. Many vocational high school graduates end up choose to go to junior colleges to further their education.<ref name=\"alberta17\"/>\n\nAs the university degree grew in prominence to employers during the 1970s and 1980s, the shift towards a more knowledge-based rather than an industrial economy resulted vocational education being pushed back in favor of the university degree for many young South Koreans and their parents. In the 1970s and 1980s, vocational education in South Korea was less than socially acceptable, yet it was another pathway to succeed in obtaining a steady job with a decent income as well as elevate their socioeconomic status, yet many vocational graduates were scorned and stigmatized by their college educated managers despite the importance of their skills for economic development.<ref name=Singmaster>{{cite web |url=http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/global_learning/2016/01/how_vocational_education_can_be_an_economic_driver.html |title=How Vocational Education Can Be an Economic Driver |publisher=Education Week |last=Singmaster |first=Heather |year=2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.asiasentinel.com/society/south-koreas-graduate-glut/ |title=South Korea's Graduate Glut  |date=June 11, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nWith South Korea's high university entrance rate, the perception of vocational educational still remains in doubt in the minds of many South Koreans. In 2013, only 18 percent of students were enrolled in vocational education programs as it was due to the prestige of university\u2014affluent families that were able to afford the tutoring that is now required for students to pass the notoriously difficult college entrance exam and be able to attend university. With the pervasive bias against vocational education, vocational students are labeled as \"underachievers\", lack a formal higher educational background, and are often looked down upon as vocational jobs are known in Korea as the [[Dirty, dangerous and demeaning|\"3Ds\" dirty, demeaning, and dangerous]]. In response, the South Korean government increased the number of spots in universities and the rate of university enrollment was 68.2 percent, an increase of 15 percent over 2014. As a result, to boost the positive image of vocational training, the South Korean government has been collaborating with countries such as Germany, Switzerland, and Austria to examine the innovative solutions that are being implemented to improve vocational education, training, and career options for young South Koreans as alternative to the traditional path of going to university.<ref name=Singmaster/><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.economist.com/news/international/21576657-around-world-almost-300m-15-24-year-olds-are-not-working-what-has-caused |title=Generation jobless |date=April 27, 2013}}</ref>\n\nAccording to a 2012 research report from The McKinsey Global Institute reckons that the lifetime value of a college graduate's improved earnings no longer justifies the expense required to obtain the degree and have called on the need for more vocational education to counteract the human cost of performance pressure and the high unemployment rate among the country's university-educated youth. The South Korean government, schools, and industry with assistance from the Swiss government and industry are now revamping and modernizing the country's once strong vocational education sector with a network of vocational schools called \"Meister Schools\".

Meister schools offer apprenticeship based training which takes place at vocational high schools, community and junior colleges. Meister schools also offer employment supportive systems for specialized Meister high school students.

The government is encouraging younger students to visit and see the programs for themselves firsthand to change their perception. Those in doubt on the quality of vocational education are encouraged to spend time working in industry during school vacations so they are up-to-date on current industry practices. Meister schools are continuing to be proving to be a good influence in changing the opinion of vocational education yet only 15,213 (5 percent) of high school students are enrolled in Meister schools with a lack of places unable to meet the demand despite a 100 percent employment rate.

Its name was The Ministry of Education, Science and Technology (often abbreviated into \"the Ministry of Education\") since 25 February 2008 to 24 February 2013. The former body, the Ministry of Education and Human Resources Development, was named by the former Minister of Education, who enhanced its function in 2001 because the administration of Kim Dae-jung considered education and human resources development as a matter of the highest priority. As a result of the reform, it began to cover the whole field of human resource development and the minister of education was appointed to the Vice Prime Minister.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} In 2008, the name was changed into the present one after the Lee Myeong Bak administration annexed the former Ministry of Science and Technology to the Education ministry. \nLike other ministers, the Minister of Education, Science and Technology is appointed by the president. They are mainly chosen from candidates who have an academic background and often resign in a fairly short term (around one year).{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}\n(Ministry of Education has no more work on science and technology because President Park restorated the Ministry works for science and technology)\n\n===Teachers' union===\nAlthough primary- and secondary-school teachers traditionally enjoyed high status, they often were overworked and underpaid during the late 1980s. Salaries were less than those for many other white-collar professions and even some blue-collar jobs. High school teachers, particularly those in the cities, however, received sizable gifts from parents seeking attention for their children, but teaching hours were long and classes crowded (the average class contained around fifty to sixty students).\n\nIn May 1989, teachers established an independent union, the [[Korean Teachers and Education Workers Union|Korean Teachers Union]] (KTU \u2014 ????????(???), ''Jeongyojo''). Their aims included improving working conditions and reforming a school system that they regarded as overly controlled by the Ministry of Education. Although the government promised large increases in allocations for teachers' salaries and facilities, it refused to give the union legal status. Because teachers were civil servants, the government claimed they did not have the right to strike and, even if they did have the right to strike, unionization would undermine the status of teachers as \"role models\" for young Koreans. The government also accused the union of spreading subversive, leftist propaganda that was sympathetic to the communist regime in North Korea.\n\nAccording to a report in ''[[The Wall Street Journal Asia]]'', the union claimed support from 82 percent of all teachers. The controversy was viewed as representing a major crisis for South Korean education because a large number of teachers (1,500 by November 1989) had been dismissed, violence among union supporters, opponents, and police had occurred at several locations, and class disruptions had caused anxieties for families of students preparing for the college entrance examinations. The union's challenge to the Ministry of Education's control of the system and the charges of subversion had made compromise seem a very remote possibility at the start 1990.<!-- What happened after 1990? -->\n\n===Political involvement in the education system===\nSouth Korea still has issues with North Korea after the [[Korean War]]. This has contributed to South Korea's confrontational stance against North Korea in the education field. For instance, on July 7, 2011, the [[National Intelligence Service (South Korea)|National Intelligence Service]] was criticized for the [[search and seizure]] of a civilian think tank, Korea Higher Education Research Institution (?????????).<ref>{{cite news |first=O-seong (??) |last=Kwon (?) | script-title=ko:???, '?? ???' ?? ???? ???? |date=2011-07-09 |url=http://www.hani.co.kr/arti/society/society_general/486615.html |work=The Hankyeoreh |accessdate=2011-07-26 |language=Korean}}</ref> This incident was carried out through a warrant to investigate an alleged South Korean spy who followed an instruction from North Korea with a purpose of instigating university student rallies to stop the ongoing tuition hike in South Korea.\n\n==English education==\nKorea, which is considered the most difficult Asian nation of people to communicate with in English, has an extensive English education history dating back to the Joseon Dynasty. During this time,  Koreans received English education in public institutes, where translators were instructed for conversion of Korean into foreign languages. The Public Foreign Language School established in 1893, educated young males to perform tasks to modernize Korea. This school, unlike facilities such as Yuk Young Gong Won (1886), disregarded social statuses, welcoming more students into the institute and introducing the first Korean foreign language instructors into the field of English education (Chang, 2009).\n\nEnglish was also taught during the Joseon Dynasty in missionary schools, which were established to spread the word of the Christian faith to Koreans, although these schools did not equip its students with the necessary tools to read, write, comprehend and speak the language. Direct Method teaching was uncommon, as instructors were often unqualified as English teachers and the textbook was limited to the Holy Bible. During the Japanese Imperialism Period, Koreans were forced to prioritize the learning and speaking of Japanese. English was offered only as an elective course, though, the instructors were often Japanese, hindering proper English pronunciation. After the liberation of Korea from Japan in 1945, the first national curriculum was established in 1955, launching greater pursuit of English education and returning the nation to speaking its native tongue.\n\nThe relevance of early English education and globalization were brought to the attention of South Korea during the 1986 Asian Games and Seoul Olympic Games, as many came to realize the value of the English language. English is taught as a required subject from the third year of elementary school up to high school, as well as in most universities, with the goal of performing well on the [[TOEIC]] and [[TOEFL]], which are tests of reading, listening and grammar-based English.  For students who achieve high scores, there is also a speaking evaluation. Universities began lecturing in English to help improve competence and though only few were competent enough themselves to lead a class, many elementary school teachers were also recommended to teach in English.\n\nIn 1994, the university entrance examination moved away from testing grammar, towards a more communicative method. Parents redirected the focus of English education to align with exam content (Park, 2009). English Language Education programs focus on ensuring competency to perform effectively as a nation in an era of globalization using proficiency-based language programs that allow students to learn according to their own abilities and interests and driving Koreans to focus more on oral proficiency (Chang, 2009 & Park, 2009). With the new focus placed on oral expertise, there has been an \"intense desire to speak native-like English\" pressuring parents to take measures to ensure the most beneficial English education (Park, 2009).\n\nBecause of large class sizes and other factors in public schools, many parents pay to send their children to private English-language schools in the afternoon or evening. Families invest significant portions of household incomes on the education of children to include English camps and language training abroad. Usually different private English-language schools specialize in teaching elementary school students or in middle and high school students. The most ambitious parents send their children to kindergartens that utilize English exclusively in the classroom. Many children also live abroad for anywhere from a few months to several years to learn English. Sometimes, a Korean mother and her children will move to an English-speaking country for an extended period of time to enhance the children's English ability. In these cases, the father left in Korea is known as a [[gireogi appa]] (Korean: \uae30\ub7ec\uae30 \uc544\ube60), literally a \"goose dad\" who must migrate to see his family.<ref name=english>{{cite news |last=Onishi |first=Norimitsu |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/08/world/asia/08geese.html |title=For English Studies, Koreans Say Goodbye to Dad |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=8 June 2008}}</ref>\n\nThere are more than 100,000 Korean students in the U.S. The increase of 10 percent every year helped Korea remain the top student-sending country in the U.S. for a second year, ahead of India and China. Korean students at Harvard University are the third most after Canadian and Chinese. In 2012, 154,000 South Korean students were pursuing degrees at overseas universities, with countries such as Japan, Canada, the United States, and Australia as top destinations.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://monitor.icef.com/2013/08/south-korean-student-mobility-takes-a-dip/ |title=South Korean student mobility takes a dip |publisher=ICEF |accessdate=19 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nKorean English classes focus on vocabulary, grammar, and reading. Academies tend to include conversation, and some offer debate and presentation.\n\nDue to recent curriculum changes, the education system in Korea is now placing a greater emphasis on English verbal abilities rather than grammatical skills. With influence from the government, English education began to focus on the communicative competence of Korean students emphasizing fluency and comprehension through listening materials. Universities require all first year students to take an English conversation class in their first year and some universities require students to take conversational English classes throughout the entirety of their university life.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} According to a 2003 survey conducted by the Hong Kong-based Political and Economic Risk Consultancy, despite being one of the countries in Asia that spends the most money on English-language education, South Korea ranks the lowest among 12 Asian countries in English ability.<!-- dead link: [http://www.straitstimes.com/Latest%2BNews/Asia/STIStory_205075.html straitstimes] -->\n\nEnglish as a subject discipline, that is, the study of linguistics, literature, composition/rhetoric, or pedagogy is uncommon except in top-tier or graduate programs in Korea. As a result, despite efforts to recruit foreign faculty in Korean universities, opportunities for tenure are fewer and professorial privileges and salaries are lower than for foreigners contracted to teach major disciplinary courses in English ([[content-based instruction]]). Overall, more native English speakers are being employed as educators in Korea to improve the English education process. Koreans have come to believe native English speakers are the best teachers of the language and to be proficient in the English language gives their children an advantage over others and is an \"educational investment that promises surplus\"(Han, 2007).\n\n==Controversy and criticism==\n\n===Students' health===\nSouth Korea's scarcity of natural resources is often cited as a reason for the rigorousness and fierce competition of its school systems; the academic pressure on its students is arguably the largest in the world. In an article entitled \"An Assault Upon Our Children,\" Se-Woong Koo wrote that \"the system's dark side casts a long shadow. Dominated by tiger moms, cram schools and highly authoritarian teachers, South Korean education produces ranks of overachieving students who pay a stiff price in health and happiness. The entire program amounts to child abuse. It should be reformed and restructured without delay.\"<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/02/opinion/sunday/south-koreas-education-system-hurts-students.html |title=An Assault Upon Our Children |last=Koo |first=Se-Woong |work=The New York Times |date=1 August 2014}}</ref> In a response to the article, educator [[Diane Ravitch]] warned against modeling an educational system in which children \"exist either to glorify the family or to build the national economy.\" She argued furthermore that the happiness of South Korean children has been sacrificed, and likened the country's students to \"cogs in a national economic machine\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://dianeravitch.net/2014/08/03/why-we-should-not-copy-education-in-south-korea/ |title=Why We Should Not Copy Education in South Korea |last=Ravitch |first=Diane |date=August 3, 2014 |accessdate=November 25, 2015}}</ref> A 2014 poll found that over half of South Korean teenagers have suicidal thoughts, with over 40% of respondents reporting that school pressure and future uncertainty dismayed them the most.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/korearealtime/2014/03/20/poll-shows-half-of-korean-teenagers-have-suicidal-thoughts/ |title=Poll Shows Half of Korean Teenagers Have Suicidal Thoughts |last=Kang |first=Yewon |newspaper=The Wall-Street Journal |date=March 20, 2014 |accessdate=August 6, 2016}}</ref> Furthermore, suicide is currently the leading cause of death among South Korean youth.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/national/2015/04/28/11/0302000000AEN20150428004700320F.html |title=Suicide No. 1 cause of death for S.

[[State school|Public schools]] and [[private school]]s have both been present. Modern reforms to education began in the late 19th century. Since its early history, Korean education has been influenced significantly by Confucian values particularly in its emphasis of formal learning and scholarship through China more than fifteen centuries ago. Confucianism instilled facilities like governance of men by merit, social mobility through education, and the civil examination system based on the system that was developed in China during the Tang Dynasty. As a result, written word and mastery of Chinese classics and literacy became the primary method in choosing individuals for bureaucratic positions, gaining them a respective social status and privileges.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Education Fever: Society, Politics, And The Pursuit of Schooling in South Korea|last=Seth|first=Michael J.|publisher=Hawai'i Studies on Korea|year=2002|isbn=0-8248-2534-9|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\nThe Chosun period was significant in shaping the dynamics and foundation of the Korean education system in that it established schools that ingrained loyalty, orthodoxy, and motivation for official recruitment into its students. The primary means to receive an education during the Chosun period were through village schools (sodang; sojae) and through private tutoring. The sodang was the most common method of formal education in Korea until the late twentieth century, and was usually available only to a handful of neighborhood boys starting at around age seven. In the middle of the sixteenth century, however, the role of official schools gradually declined with the emergence of private academies (sowon), which usually functioned as rural retreats and centers of learning until the majority of them were closed in the 1870s in an effort to centralize authority.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nPreparing students for competitive examinations were pronounced during the Chosun era as a means of social mobility and selection of official positions, and remained a basic tenet in Korean education throughout its history. However, this extreme emphasis on education and meritocracy was contrasted by hereditary aristocracy during the Chosun period, where bloodlines and kinship were particularly pronounced. Due to Confucian influences, however, education was able to maintain a fairly equalizing presence over society because of its belief in each individual being capable of benefitting from formal education and achieving enlightenment. Education was also dominated by the exalted scholar-teacher relationship, where teachers held almost a sacred status and were seen as a principal source of ethical counsel. This convention also engendered the tradition of ''remonstrance'', which obligated the scholar to criticize the actions of the government and even the king in order to avoid threatening the Confucian-inspired concept of the moral order of the universe.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe dynastic period did not prioritize special or technical training, and thus a preference for a non-specialized and literary education has remained in Korea. Many of these developments were pronounced towards the end of the 19<sup>th</sup> century when the Chosun dynasty began implementing a Western-style education system as a result of the intrusion of foreign powers into Korea. By 1904, public education was largely confined to Seoul, which was generally resisted by the public as well as government officials. This maintained the dominance of sodang and other traditional institutions as the primary means to receive a formal education. However, as a result of financial support from members of the royal family and American missionary activities and schools, the number of schools began to increase in the early 1900s. As a means to promote basic literacy among its citizens, Korea also introduced mixed script of Hangeul and Chinese characters into its instruction.<ref name=\":0\" /> \n\nDuring the Japanese occupation (1905-1945), Korea was able to establish a comprehensive and modern system of national education through centralization and deliberate planning of integrating Japanese occupational professionalism and values. However, there were severe restrictions like the lack of access to education beyond the elementary level for Koreans and the manipulation of education to indoctrinate Korean subjects to be loyal to the Japanese empire, which led to turmoil and discontent among Koreans who were forced to assimilate. The Japanese emphasized low-level and non-professional track schooling for Koreans which was pronounced by the Educational Ordinance of 1911, where Japanese residents had fourteen years of schooling available while Koreans only had eight years available to them, unless they were civil servants wherein eleven was the maximum. Schooling was primarily based on Japanese values, literacy, and history as an attempt to make young Koreans loyal to the Japanese state and indirectly wipe out Korean culture and history. As a minor development, the Educational Ordinance of 1922 was enacted, which reopened the Seoul Teachers' School, extended elementary and secondary education, and added college preparatory or advanced technical training to the curriculum.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nHigher education became a central issue for upper-class and upwardly mobile Koreans, who were provided very limited access to these institutions as well as positions of administration and teaching. Furthermore, with the introduction of the Educational Ordinance of 1938, Korean schools were to be identical to Japanese ones in organization and curriculum, which made education a highly militarized and regimented tool for forced assimilation and militarization.<ref name=\":0\" /> These last few years of Japanese rule pronounced the discontent of Koreans whose social and political climates had been deeply affected.\n\n===Post-war years===\nAfter [[Gwangbokjeol]] and the liberation from Japan, the Korean government began to study and discuss for a new [[philosophy of education]]. The new educational philosophy was created under the [[United States Army Military Government in Korea]](USAMGIK) with a focus on [[democratic education]]. The new system attempted to make education available to all students equally and promote the educational administration to be more self-governing. It also emphasized a decentralized education which local and community control in order to maintain educational autonomy from authoritarian policies. Specific policies included: re-educating [[teacher]]s, lowering [[functional illiteracy]] by educating adults, restoration of the [[Korean language]] for [[technical terminology]], and expansion of various educational institutions.<ref name=\"EncyKorea\">{{cite web |url=http://encykorea.aks.ac.kr/Contents/Index?contents_id=E0005524 |script-title=ko:?? |publisher=[[Academy of Korean Studies]] |work=Encyclopedia of Korean Culture |accessdate=January 22, 2014 |language=Korean |trans-title=Education}}</ref> This system did not instigate radical change, however, to the extent that it maintained the centralized and authoritarian administration created by the Japanese with no meaningful changes. It did, however, abet in the Koreanization of South Korean education through the initiative of Korean leaders by promoting Hangeul, removing Japanese instruction practices, and emphasizing Korean history, geography, and literature. Aside from these developments, the most striking feature of the U.S. military occupation was the significant expansion of schooling and the student population.\n\nFollowing the [[Korean War]], the government of Syngman Rhee reversed many of these reforms after 1948, when only primary schools remained in most cases coeducational and, because of a lack of resources, education was compulsory only up to the sixth grade. In 1948, the prevalent debate in South Korean education was whether to maintain an elitist multitrack path based on the prewar Japanese colonial model, or adopt an open American system that avoided early tracking and did not terminalize primary or secondary education.\n\nDuring the years when Rhee and [[Park Chung Hee]] were in power, the control of education was gradually taken out of the hands of local school boards and concentrated in a centralized Ministry of Education. In the late 1980s, the ministry was responsible for administration of schools, allocation of resources, setting of enrollment quotas, certification of schools and teachers, curriculum development (including the issuance of textbook guidelines), and other basic policy decisions. Provincial and special city boards of education still existed. Although each board was composed of seven members who were supposed to be selected by popularly elected legislative bodies, this arrangement ceased to function after 1973. Subsequently, school board members were approved by the minister of education. In high school they would call it year one grade (9th grader) and year 2 would be (10th grader) and so on. Therefore, a multitrack and single secondary school system prevailed, largely due to the fact that administrators did not want to divide institutions, and parents were not receptive to the idea of two entrance exams''.'' The outcome the 1950 MOE proposal for a uniform system was a 6-4-3-4 academic schedule, which entailed 6 years of primary school, 4 years of middle school, 3 years of vocational or academic high school, and 4 years of college or university. A complex system of technical and vocational training was also added to educational policy, where children were able to decide on an academic versus a vocational route early on in their academic career. Many opposers of this policy actually viewed it as positive because they believed that the academic route would seem more prolific and parents and students would be willing to pursue it more than the vocational route. Furthermore, even though a few local school boards were established toward the late 1940s, they were not appreciated by many Koreans because there was a widespread notion that a uniform and centrally controlled system is best. A rigorous and uniform national curriculum was established in the mid-1950s and there were significant efforts to make school accessible for everyone, especially in the context of Rhee's declaration of compulsory universal literacy and basic education. While universal basic education eliminated disparities between classes, competition became very fierce due to restricted entry into higher academic tiers, which contributed to the predominant \"education fever\" that is still prevalent in South Korea.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn the 1960s, there was a difficulty in harnessing the demand for education towards the needs of an industrializing economy, which caused a growth in private foundations in order to supply the public demand for schooling. Furthermore, the 60s and 70s were characterized by a large demand to direct educational development to economic development, which necessitated a greater emphasis on vocational and technical training rather than academic training in order to help citizens gain skills that would supply the country's economic needs. Even though there were major criticisms on behalf of the public for this emphasis on vocational training due to a clashing with Confucian values, the state continued to strengthen vocational education, especially after the shift in industrialization to heavy chemical and machine industries in the 70s. The 1960s and 70s experienced turmoil in education systems due to public resistance and the uncooperativeness of private schools with the state as they attempted to supply public demand. While the state was able to fulfill many of its economic goals, it came at a great social and political cost like the depopulation of rural areas and President Park's assassination <ref name=\":0\" />. \n\nMost observers agree that South Korea's spectacular progress in modernization and economic growth since the [[Korean War]] is largely attributable to the willingness of individuals to invest a large amount of resources in education: the improvement of \"human capital.\" The traditional esteem for the educated man, now extends to scientists, technicians, and others working with specialized knowledge. Highly educated technocrats and economic planners could claim much of the credit for their country's economic successes since the 1960s. Scientific professions were generally regarded as the most prestigious by South Koreans in the 1980s.\n\nStatistics demonstrate the success of South Korea's national education programs. In 1945 the adult literacy rate was estimated at 22 percent; by 1970 adult literacy was 87.6 percent<ref name=\"William Shaw 1990\">Andrea Matles Savada and William Shaw, editors. ''South Korea: A Country Study''. Washington: GPO for the Library of Congress, 1990.</ref> and, by the late 1980s, sources estimated it at around 93 percent.<ref name=\"William Shaw 1990\"/> Although only primary school (grades one through six) was compulsory, percentages of age-groups of children and young people enrolled in secondary level schools were equivalent to those found in industrialized countries, including Japan. Approximately 4.8 million students in the eligible age-group were attending primary school in 1985. The percentage of students going on to optional middle school the same year was more than 99 percent. Approximately 34 percent, one of the world's highest rates of secondary-school graduates attended institutions of higher education in 1987, a rate similar to Japan's (about 30 percent) and exceeding Britain's (20 percent).\n\nGovernment expenditure on education has been generous. In 1975, it was 220 billion [[South Korean won|won]],<ref name=\"William Shaw 1990\"/> the equivalent of 2.2 percent of the gross national product, or 13.9 percent of total government expenditure. By 1986, education expenditure had reached 3.76 trillion [[South Korean won|won]], or 4.5 percent of the GNP, and 27.3 percent of government budget allocations.\n\nThe 1980s and 90s marked an era of democratization and economic prosperity in South Korea, partly due to the \"education fever\". In 1991, for the first time in thirty years, the country elected provincial and city councils in order to localize education, and leaders like Kim Young Sam and Kim Dae Jung were able to enact major overhauls to the education system in order to accommodate democratization through methods like abolishing on-campus ROTCS training and political mobilization of students, legalization of teacher unions, and removing anti-Communist texts<ref name=\":0\" />. The MOE began to shift away from a uniform curriculum by allowing school boards to implement some minor variations in instructional content. Literacy became virtually universal in South Korea while it rose up in international ranks in math and science, especially. \n\nDespite South Korea's transition to democracy, traditional and Confucian values remained very strong. Overall, the huge strides in educational development came at the cost of intense pressure among students, high suicide rates, and family financial struggles through investment in schooling and private tutoring. \n\n===Student activism===\nStudent activism has a long and honorable history in Korea. Students in [[Joseon]] secondary schools often became involved in the intense factional struggles of the scholar-official class. Students played a major role in Korea's independence movement, particularly in March 1, 1919, which was a protest based on students' growing resentment towards restrictive, discriminatory, and hostile Japanese occupation and instruction practices. Students were also heavily involved in repeated national efforts and demonstrations against Japanese policies, with instances like the Gwangju Student Movement in 1929 and the June 10, 1926 funeral line protest. \n\nStudents protested against the regimes of [[Syngman Rhee]] and [[Park Chung-hee]] during the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s. Observers noted, however, that while student activists in the past generally embraced liberal and democratic values, the new generation of militants in the 1980s were far more radical. Most participants adopted some version of the [[minjung]] ideology but was also animated by strong feelings of popular [[nationalism]] and [[xenophobia]].\n\nOne of the most extreme and landmark movements was the Kwangju Massacre in 1980, where students were driven by a strong will to rebel through Marxist influences against the martial law government. This radicalism was paralleled by the communist sympathizing and radicalism of students in the 1940s and 50s as a result of American occupation.\n\nThe most militant university students, perhaps about 5 percent of the total enrollment at [[Seoul National University]] and comparable figures at other institutions in the [[Seoul|capital]] during the late 1980s, were organized into small circles or cells rarely containing more than fifty members. Police estimated that there were 72 such organizations of varying orientation, having the change of curriculum and education system of South Korea people have been enriched in an imaginary way that makes them propel in all their studies.\n\n===Reforms in the 1980s===\nFollowing the assumption of power by General [[Chun Doo-hwan]] in 1980, the Ministry of Education implemented a number of reforms designed to make the system more fair and to increase higher education opportunities for the population at large. In a very popular move, the ministry dramatically increased enrollment at large.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nSocial emphasis on education was not without its problems, as it tended to accentuate class differences. In the late 1980s, a college degree was considered necessary for entering the middle class; there were no alternative pathways of social advancement, with the possible exception of a military career, outside higher education. People without a college education, including skilled workers with vocational school backgrounds, often were treated as second-class citizens by their white-collar, college-educated managers, despite the importance of their skills for economic development. Intense competition for places at the most prestigious universities\u2014the sole gateway into elite circles\u2014promoted, like the old Confucian system, a sterile emphasis on rote memorization in order to pass secondary school and college entrance examinations. Particularly after a dramatic expansion of college enrollments in the early 1980s, South Korea faced the problem of what to do about a large number of young people staying in school for a long time, usually at great sacrifice to themselves and their families, and then faced with limited job opportunities because their skills were not marketable.\n\n===Great recession===\nWith a slowing economy, a rigid and fast-changing job market as a result of the [[Financial crisis of 2007\u201308]] and the demise of the [[Industrial Age]], many young South Korean high school graduates are now realizing that high entrance examination and test scores for the promise of future career success did not carry the same weight as it once did.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/07/world/asia/07pride.html |title=With Wounded Pride, Unemployed Koreans Quietly Turn to Manual Labor |last=FACKLER |first=MARTIN  |date=July 6, 2009}}</ref> In 2013, 43,000 South Koreans in their twenties, and 21,000 in their thirties lost their jobs.<ref name=ICEF>{{cite web |url=http://monitor.icef.com/2014/01/high-performance-high-pressure-in-south-koreas-education-system/ |title=High performance, high pressure in South Korea's education system |publisher=ICEF Monitor |date=23 January 2014 |accessdate=29 May 2016}}</ref> According to a 2013 survey conducted by the Korea Research Institute for Vocational Education and Training, nearly four out of every 10 young workers in their 20s and 30s said they were overeducated.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.saveourschools.com.au/national-issues/south-korea-education-success-has-a-dark-side |title=Fighting for Equity in Education |date=November 24, 2013 |access-date=December 5, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161118102555/http://www.saveourschools.com.au/national-issues/south-korea-education-success-has-a-dark-side |archive-date=November 18, 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name=\"Stratfor\">{{cite web |url=https://www.stratfor.com/analysis/south-korea-votes-changing-region |title=South Korea Votes in a Changing Region |date=April 13, 2016 |publisher=Stratfor}}</ref> In 2013, fewer young South Koreans chose go on to university after finishing high school as the unemployment rate for university graduates continues to soar, falling income for college graduates continues to decline and the value of a college degree has now becoming increasingly in doubt.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2013/09/07/2013090700379.html |title=Fewer Young People Go On to University |publisher=The Chosun |accessdate=29 May 2016}}</ref> Educational reforms initiated by the South Korean government have become more dynamic and that university is no longer the only guarantee of a career.<ref name=\"Ng Jing Yng 1\">{{cite web | url=http://www.todayonline.com/world/asia/revamped-vocational-education-may-have-prevented-graduate-glut-ex-korean-minister?page=1 | title=Earlier introduction of vocational education 'could have prevented' S Korea's grad glut | publisher=Today | date=24 July 2015 | accessdate=2 October 2016 | author=Ng Jing Yng}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://english.donga.com/List/3/all/26/404739/1 | title=Meister of job placement | publisher=The Dong-A-Ilbo | date=22 September 2012 | accessdate=14 October 2016}}</ref> Government measures have also been prompted to encourage young unemployed college graduates to look at other employment possibilities such as starting a business or seeking employment opportunities at smaller and medium size businesses.<ref name=\"The Korea Herald\">{{cite web | url=http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20091116000035 | title=Lee urges job seekers to look for opportunities at smaller companies | publisher=The Korea Herald | date=30 March 2010 | accessdate=26 October 2016}}</ref> Former President [[Lee Myung-Bak]] urged young unemployed job seekers to start looking at other employment possibilities with small and medium-sized businesses beyond large conglomerates.<ref name=\"The Korea Herald\"/><ref>{{cite web | url=http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2016/09/01/2016090101665.html | title=Young Jobseekers Must Look Beyond Big Business | publisher=The Chosun llbo | date=1 September 2016 | accessdate=26 October 2016}}</ref>\n\nAn oversaturated and overqualified labor market has resulted in shortages of skilled blue-collar labor and a lack of qualified vocational employees for small and medium-sized businesses, young South Koreans now realize that a college degree no longer guarantees a job as it once did.<ref name=\"Ng Jing Yng 1\"/> With the nation's high university entrance rate, South Korea has produced an overeducated and underemployed labor force with many being unable find employment at the level of their education qualifications.

Many students in Korea start kindergarten at the Western age of three and will, therefore, continue to study in kindergarten for three or four years, before starting their 'formal education' in 'grade one' of primary school. Many private kindergartens offer their classes in English to give students a 'head-start' in the mandatory English education they would receive later in public school. Kindergartens often pay homage to the expectations of parents with impressive courses, graduation ceremonies, complete with diplomas and gowns. Korean kindergartens are expected to start teaching basic maths, reading and writing to children, including education on how to count, add, subtract, and read and write in Korean, and often in English and Chinese. Children in Korean kindergartens are also taught using games focused on education and coordination, such as \"playing doctor\" to teach body parts, food and nutrition, and work positions for adults. Songs, dances, and memorization are a big part of Korean kindergarten education.\n\n==Primary education==\n[[Elementary schools]] ({{lang-ko|\ucd08\ub4f1 \ud559\uad50, ????}}, ''chodeung hakgyo'') consists of grades [[First grade|one]] to [[sixth grade|six]] (age 8 to age 13 in [[East Asian age reckoning|Korean years]]\u20147 to 12 in western years). The South Korean government changed its name to the current form from ''Citizens' school'' ({{lang-ko|\uad6d\ubbfc \ud559\uad50, ????}}, ''Gukmin hakgyo'') in 1996. The former name was shortened from \ud669\uad6d \uc2e0\ubbfc \ud559\uad50, ??????  (''Hwangguk sinmin hakgyo''), which means ''school of the people who are subjects of the Empire (of Japan)''.\n\nIn [[elementary school]], students learn the following subjects.  The curriculum differs from grades 1-2 to grades 3-6.<ref>[[:ko:????? ????]]</ref>\n\n'''Grades 1\u20132:'''\n*''We Are First Graders'' ({{lang-ko|1\ud559\ub144 1??}}) (grade 1 only)\n*Korean (listening, speaking, reading, writing)\n*[[Mathematics]]\n*''Disciplined Life'' ({{lang-ko|????}})\n*''Sensible Life'' ({{lang-ko|??????}})\n*''Enjoyable Life'' ({{lang-ko|?????}})\n*Above three changed a few years ago into \"Spring(\ubd04,Bom)\",\"Summer(\uc5ec\ub984,Yeo-Reum)\",\"Fall(\uac00\uc744,Ga-eul)\",\"Winter(\uaca8\uc6b8,Gyeo-Ul)\"\n*[[Physical Education]]\n\n'''Grades 3\u20136:'''\n*Korean (listening, speaking, reading, writing)\n*[[English as a second or foreign language|English]]\n*[[Character education|Moral Education]]\n*[[Social Studies]]\n*[[Mathematics]]\n*[[Science]]\n*[[Art]]\n*[[Music]]\n*Practical Arts\n*[[Physical Education]]\n\nUsually, the class teacher covers most of the subjects; however, there are some specialised teachers in professions such as physical education and [[foreign language]]s, including [[English as a second or foreign language|English]].\n\nThose who wish to become a primary school teacher must major in primary education, which is specially designed to cultivate primary school teachers. In Korea, most of the primary teachers are working for public primary schools.\n\nBecause corporal punishment has been officially and legally prohibited in every classroom since 2011, many teachers and some parents raised with corporal punishment are becoming more concerned about what they see as worsening discipline problems. Some teachers continue to use corporal punishment discreetly.<ref>{{cite news |first=Jeyup S. |last=Kwaak |title=Extreme Corporal Punishment Case in Seoul School Sparks Debate |work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |date=28 June 2014 |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/korearealtime/2014/06/28/extreme-corporal-punishment-case-in-seoul-school-sparks-debate/}}</ref>\n\n==Secondary education==\nIn 1987, there were approximately 4,895,354 students enrolled in middle schools and high schools, with approximately 150,873 teachers.

Given the importance of entry into higher education, the majority of students attended general or academic high schools in 1987: 1,397,359 students, or 60 percent of the total, attended general or academic high schools, as compared with 840,265 students in vocational secondary schools. Vocational schools specialized in a number of fields: primarily agriculture, fishery, commerce, trades, merchant marine, engineering, and the arts.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}\n\nCompetitive entrance examinations at the middle-school level were abolished in 1968. Although as of the late 1980s, students still had to pass noncompetitive qualifying examinations, they were assigned to secondary institutions by lottery, or else by location within the boundary of the school district. Secondary schools, formerly ranked according to the quality of their students, have been equalized, with a portion of good, mediocre, and poor students being assigned to each one. The reform, however, did not equalize secondary schools completely. In Seoul, students who performed well in qualifying examinations were allowed to attend better quality schools in a \"common\" district, while other students attended schools in one of five geographical districts. The reforms applied equally to public and private schools whose enrollments were strictly controlled by the Ministry of Education.\n\nIn South Korea, the grade of a student is reset as the student progresses through elementary, middle and high school. To differentiate the grades between students, one would often state the grade based on the level of education he/she is in. For example, a student in the first year of middle school would be referred to as \"First grade in Middle School (\uc911\ud559\uad50 1\ud559\ub144.)\".\n\nMiddle schools are called ''Jung hakgyo'' (\uc911\ud559\uad50) in Korean, which literally means ''middle school''. High schools are called ''Godeung hakgyo'' (\uace0\ub4f1\ud559\uad50) in Korean, literally meaning \"high school\".\n\n===Middle school===\n[[Middle schools]] in South Korea consist of three grades. Most students enter at age 12 or 13 and graduate at age 15 or 16 (western years). These three grades correspond roughly to grades 7\u20139 in the North American system and Years 8\u201311 in the [[Education in England|English]] and [[Education in Wales|Welsh]] system.\n\nMiddle school in South Korea marks a considerable shift from primary school, with students expected to take studies and school much more seriously. At most middle schools regulation uniforms and haircuts are enforced fairly strictly, and some aspects of students' lives are highly controlled. Like in primary school, students spend most of the day in the same homeroom classroom with the same classmates; however, students have different teachers for each subject. Teachers move around from classroom to classroom, and few teachers apart from those who teach special subjects have their own rooms to which students come. Homeroom teachers (\ub2f4\uc784 \uad50\uc0ac, [[Revised Romanization of Korean|RR]]: ''damim gyosa'') play a very important role in students' lives.\n\nMost middle school students take seven lessons a day, and in addition to this usually have an early morning block that precedes regular lessons and an eighth lesson specializing in an extra subject to finish the day. Unlike with high school, middle school curricula do not vary much from school to school. Korean, Algebra, Geometry, English, social studies, and science form the core subjects, with students also receiving instruction in [[music]], [[art]], PE, [[korean history]], [[ethics]], [[home economics]], secondary language, technology, and [[Hanja]]. What subjects students study and in what amount may vary from year to year. All regular lessons are 45 minutes long. Before school, students have an extra block, 30-or-more minutes long, that may be used for self-study, watching Educational Broadcast System (EBS) broadcasts, or for personal or class administration. Beginning in 2008, students attended school from Monday to Friday, and had a half-day every 1st, 3rd, and 5th (calendar permitting) Saturday of the month. Saturday lessons usually included Club Activity (CA) lessons, where students could participate in extracurricular activities. However, these classes were also not used well either. Many schools have regular classes except having extracurricular activities because schools and parents want students to study more. However, from 2012 onwards, primary and secondary schools, including middle schools, will no longer hold Saturday classes. However, still many schools have Saturday classes illegally because the parents want their children to go to school and study.<ref name=\"Thomaswhite.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.thomaswhite.com/world-markets/south-korea-an-end-to-saturday-classes/ |title=South Korea: An end to Saturday classes &#124; Thomas White International |publisher=Thomaswhite.com |date=2011-09-26}}</ref>\n\nIn 1969, the government abolished entrance examinations for middle school students, replacing it with a system whereby primary school students within the same district are selected for middle schools by a lottery system. This has the effect of equalizing the quality of students from school to school, though schools in areas where students come from more privileged backgrounds still tend to outperform schools in poorer areas. Until recently most middle schools have been same-sex, though in the past decade most new middle schools have been mixed, and some previously same-sex schools have converted to mixed as well. Some schools have converted to same-sex due to pressure from parents who thought that their children would study better in [[single-sex education]].\n\nAs with primary schools, students pass from grade to grade regardless of knowledge or academic achievement, the result being that classes often have students of vastly differing abilities learning the same subject material together. In the final year of middle school examination scores become very important for the top students hoping to gain entrance into the top high schools, and for those in the middle hoping to get into an academic rather than a technical or vocational high school. Otherwise, examinations and marks only matter insofar as living up to a self-enforced concept of position in the school ranking system. There are some standardized examinations for certain subjects, and teachers of academic subjects are expected to follow approved textbooks, but generally middle school teachers have more flexibility over curricula and methods than teachers at high school.\n\nMore than 95% of the middle school students also attend independent owned, after-school tutoring agencies known as ''Hagwon'', or \"cram schools\", in order to receive extra instruction from private tutors. The core subjects, especially the cumulative subjects of Korean, English and math, receive the most emphasis. Some ''Hagwon'' specializing in just one subject, and others offer all core subjects, constituting a second round of schooling every day for their pupils. Indeed, some parents place more stress on their children's ''Hagwon'' studies than their public school studies. Additionally, many students attend academies for things such as martial arts or music. The result of all this is that many middle school students, like their high school counterparts, return from a day of schooling well after sunset. The average South Korean family spends 20% percent of its income on after-hours cram schools, more spending per capita on private tutoring than any other country.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/education-jan-june11-koreaschools_01-21/ | title=In Hypercompetitive South Korea, Pressures Mount on Young Pupils | publisher=PBS | date=21 January 2011 | accessdate=28 October 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.ft.com/content/7bd4a52a-3b06-11e3-a7ec-00144feab7de | title=Education in South Korea: system must change to satisfy country's and pupils' needs | publisher=Financial Times | date=5 November 2013 | accessdate=28 October 2016 | author=Song Jung-a}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://spectator.sme.sk/c/20051653/seeing-the-shared-traits.html | title=Seeing the shared traits | publisher=The Slovak Spectator | accessdate=28 October 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | title=On My Own: Korean Businesses and Race Relations in America | publisher=University of Chicago Press. | author=In-Jin Yoon | year=1997 | page=78}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.arirang.co.kr/news/News_View.asp?nseq=146856 | title=Korean parents spending most of income on children's education | publisher=Arirang News | date=7 May 2013 | accessdate=28 October 2016}}</ref>\n\n===High school===\n[[High school]]s in South Korea teach students for three years, from first grade (age 15\u201317) to third grade (age 17\u201319), and students commonly graduate at age 18 or 19. High school students are commonly expected to study increasingly long hours each year moving toward graduation, to become competitive and be able to enter attractive universities in Korea that almost all parents and teachers want students to enter. Many high school students wake and leave home in the morning at 5{{nbsp}}am. When the school is over at 4 pm, they go to a studying room in the school or to a library to study instead of going home. This is called 'Yaja', which literally means 'evening self-study'. They don't need to go home to eat dinner since most schools provide paid dinner for students. After finishing yaja (usually ends at 11:00 pm, but later than 12:00 am at some schools), they return home after studying, then return to specialty study schools (which are called [[Hagwon]]) often till 3{{nbsp}}am, from Monday to Friday. In addition, they often study on weekends.\n\nThe Yaja had not been really 'self' study for more than 30 years; all high school students were forced to do it. From the 2010s, the Ministry of Education has encouraged high schools to free students of yaja and to allow them do it whenever they want, and many normal public high schools near Seoul are now no longer forcing students do it. But private high schools, special-purpose high schools (such as science high schools, foreign language high schools), or normal schools far from Seoul are still forcing students to do yaja.\n\nIt is a commonly known saying in Korea that 'If you sleep three hours a night, you may get into a top 'SKY university;(National Seoul University,Yeonse Unibersity, Korean University)' If you sleep four hours each night, you may get into another university; if you sleep five or more hours each night, especially in your last year of high school, forget about getting into any university.'. Accordingly, many high school students in their final year do not have any free time for holidays, birthdays or vacations before the CSATs (College Scholastic Ability Test, Korean: \uc218\ub2a5,Suneung), which are university entrance exams held by the Ministry of Education. Surprisingly, some high school students are offered chances to travel with family to enjoy fun and relaxing vacations, but these offers are often refused on the first suggestion by the students themselves, and increasingly on later additional trips if any, due to peer influences and a fear of 'falling behind' in classes. Many high school students seem to prefer staying with friends and studying, rather than taking a break. The idea of 'skipping classes' for fun is extremely rare in Korea. Rebellious students will often stay in class and use smartphones connected to the internet to chat with friends behind the teacher's back during classes.\n\nHigh schools in Korea can be divided into specialty tracks that accord with a student's interest and career path or a normal - state high school. For special high schools, there are science ([[Seoul Science High School|Science high school]]), foreign language, international and art specialty high schools to which students can attend by passing entrance examinations which are generally highly competitive. These schools are called special-purpose high schools. And there are autonomous private high schools, which are relatively free of the policy of the Ministry of Education. Also, there are schools for gifted students. Tuition of many special-purpose high schools, autonomous private high schools, and schools for gifted students are highly expensive (the average of tuition of special-purpose or autonomous private high school is US$5,614 per year.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.hani.co.kr/arti/society/schooling/377928.html|title=???\u00b7??? ?? ?? 603??|date=2009-09-21|access-date=2018-03-27|language=ko}}</ref> One of schools for gifted students is US$7,858 per year<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://m.khan.co.kr/view.html?artid=201702061142001&code=940100&med_id=khan|title=?????? ?? ?? 1200??\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7?? ?????? ??|date=2017-02-06|access-date=2018-03-27|language=ko}}</ref>). There are few schools that require more than what's calculated in the article as an average, CheongShim International Academy, Hankuk Academy of Foreign studies, Korean Minjok Leadership Academy, Ha-Na academy are known for their expensive tuition, But at the same time, these schools are also known for its students high academic achievements and college results mostly sending more than 50% of their students to SKY university yearly. Other types of high schools include public normal high schools and private normal high schools, both with or without entrance examinations. These high schools do not report to specialize in a field but are more focused on sending their students to top and popular colleges.\n\nHowever, since the appearance of special-purpose, autonomous private and international schools and schools for gifted students, almost every normal high school have sent few students to ''top and popular'' college. Because those schools' infrastructure, teaching ability of teachers, and other activities provided by them which improves students' school record ''so that they can enter top colleges'' were absolutely better than normal schools' ones. This means those schools won the competition of sending students to universities; if you are normal high school student, it's hard to enter SKY. So excellent students and their parents avoid to enter normal high school and tried to enter special-purpose, autonomous private, and schools for gifted students. Therefore, only students whose grade is normal or too low to enter vocational school entered normal high school. Then excellent students avoid entering the normal high schools because the academic level of students in normal school is low. This vicious cycle continued, and normal schools got ''slumisim'' so the cycle got even more vicious. As a result, since the admission committee of top universities don't like to admit students from normal schools which got slum, they started to prefer to admit students from special-purpose, autonomous private, or international schools or schools from gifted students mainly. So the cycle got worse. This made the competition of entering special-purpose, autonomous private, and international schools and schools for gifted students so hard that the competition got as hard as one of entering top colleges.\n\nOn noting the schedule of many high school students, it is not unusual for them to arrive home from school at midnight or even as late as 3{{nbsp}}am after intensive \"self-study\" sessions supported by the school or parents. The Korean government has tried to crack down on such damaging study habits in order to allow a more balanced system, mostly by fining many privately run specialty study institutes ([[Hagwon]]) for running classes as late (or as early) as 2{{nbsp}}am. To solve this problem, the Korean government made a law that bans hagwons from running classes after 10:00 pm, which is often not conformed to. Some such institutes also offer early morning classes for students to attend before going to school in the morning.\n\nThe normal government school curriculum is often noted as rigorous, with as many as 16 or so subjects. Most students choose to also attend privately run profit-making institutes known as [[hagwon]] (??, Korean: \ud559\uc6d0) to boost their academic performance. Core subjects include Korean, English and mathematics, with adequate emphasis on social and physical science subjects. Students do not typically ask questions in the classroom, but prefer to memorise details. It is critical to note that the type and level of subjects may differ from school to school, depending on the degree of selectivity and specialisation of the school. Specialty, optional, expensive, study schools help students memorise questions and answers from previous years' CAT tests (since August 1993) and universities' interview questions.\n\nHigh school is not [[mandatory education|mandatory]], unlike middle school education in Korea. However, according to a 2005 study of [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) member countries, some 97% of South Korea's young adults do complete high school. This was the highest percentage recorded in any country.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/education/4240668.stm |title=South Korea's education success |work=[[BBC News]] |date=13 September 2005}}</ref> However, this is mainly due to the fact that there is no such thing as a failing grade in Korea, and most graduate as long as they attend school a certain number of days.\n\nAs it stands, the Korean secondary system of education is highly successful in preparing students for teacher-centered education such as that often used to teach mathematics since the transfer of information is mostly one way, from teacher to student. However, this does not hold true for classroom environments where students are expected to take on self-reliant roles wherein, for the most part, active and creative personalities seem to lead to success.<ref name=\"one\">{{cite report |last=Jambor |first=Zoltan Paul |title=Favourable Teaching Approaches in the South Korean Post Secondary Classroom |publisher=[[Education Resources Information Center]], [[United States Department of Education]] |date=26 November 2009 |url=http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED507310.pdf}}</ref>\n\nIt is becoming ever more evident that active student use of the English language in Korean high schools is increasingly necessary for the purposes of helping the students enter top universities in Korea as well as abroad.<ref>{{cite report |last=Jambor |first=Paul Z. |title=English Language Necessity: What It means for Korea and Non-English Speaking Countries |publisher=Education Resources Information Center, United States Department of Education |date=January 2012 |url=http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED528279.pdf}}</ref>\n\n===Vocational===\nSouth Korea once had a strong vocational education system that it rebuilt its shattered economy after the [[Korean War]].

In vocational high schools, student spend half of the time on general courses along with vocational courses as the other half.

Agricultural high schools have a focus on scientific farming and is designed to produce skilled experts in agriculture while fishery and oceanography high schools utilize maritime resource to focus on navigation technology. Since the 1980s, vocational high schools have offered training in various fields to create a labor force that can adjust to the changes across South Korean industry and society. Due to needs of manpower across the heavy and chemical industries in the 1970s. the need for vocational education was crucial. By the 1980s. due the great changes in technology, the objective of vocational education was to create a supply of well trained technicians.  When graduates of vocational high schools are done, the student receives a vocational high school diploma and may choose to enter the workforce or go on to higher education. Many vocational high school graduates end up choose to go to junior colleges to further their education.<ref name=\"alberta17\"/>\n\nAs the university degree grew in prominence to employers during the 1970s and 1980s, the shift towards a more knowledge-based rather than an industrial economy resulted vocational education being pushed back in favor of the university degree for many young South Koreans and their parents. In the 1970s and 1980s, vocational education in South Korea was less than socially acceptable, yet it was another pathway to succeed in obtaining a steady job with a decent income as well as elevate their socioeconomic status, yet many vocational graduates were scorned and stigmatized by their college educated managers despite the importance of their skills for economic development.<ref name=Singmaster>{{cite web |url=http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/global_learning/2016/01/how_vocational_education_can_be_an_economic_driver.html |title=How Vocational Education Can Be an Economic Driver |publisher=Education Week |last=Singmaster |first=Heather |year=2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.asiasentinel.com/society/south-koreas-graduate-glut/ |title=South Korea's Graduate Glut  |date=June 11, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nWith South Korea's high university entrance rate, the perception of vocational educational still remains in doubt in the minds of many South Koreans. In 2013, only 18 percent of students were enrolled in vocational education programs as it was due to the prestige of university\u2014affluent families that were able to afford the tutoring that is now required for students to pass the notoriously difficult college entrance exam and be able to attend university. With the pervasive bias against vocational education, vocational students are labeled as \"underachievers\", lack a formal higher educational background, and are often looked down upon as vocational jobs are known in Korea as the [[Dirty, dangerous and demeaning|\"3Ds\" dirty, demeaning, and dangerous]]. In response, the South Korean government increased the number of spots in universities and the rate of university enrollment was 68.2 percent, an increase of 15 percent over 2014. As a result, to boost the positive image of vocational training, the South Korean government has been collaborating with countries such as Germany, Switzerland, and Austria to examine the innovative solutions that are being implemented to improve vocational education, training, and career options for young South Koreans as alternative to the traditional path of going to university.<ref name=Singmaster/><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.economist.com/news/international/21576657-around-world-almost-300m-15-24-year-olds-are-not-working-what-has-caused |title=Generation jobless |date=April 27, 2013}}</ref>\n\nAccording to a 2012 research report from The McKinsey Global Institute reckons that the lifetime value of a college graduate's improved earnings no longer justifies the expense required to obtain the degree and have called on the need for more vocational education to counteract the human cost of performance pressure and the high unemployment rate among the country's university-educated youth. The South Korean government, schools, and industry with assistance from the Swiss government and industry are now revamping and modernizing the country's once strong vocational education sector with a network of vocational schools called \"Meister Schools\".

Meister schools offer apprenticeship based training which takes place at vocational high schools, community and junior colleges. Meister schools also offer employment supportive systems for specialized Meister high school students.

The government is encouraging younger students to visit and see the programs for themselves firsthand to change their perception. Those in doubt on the quality of vocational education are encouraged to spend time working in industry during school vacations so they are up-to-date on current industry practices. Meister schools are continuing to be proving to be a good influence in changing the opinion of vocational education yet only 15,213 (5 percent) of high school students are enrolled in Meister schools with a lack of places unable to meet the demand despite a 100 percent employment rate.

Its name was The Ministry of Education, Science and Technology (often abbreviated into \"the Ministry of Education\") since 25 February 2008 to 24 February 2013. The former body, the Ministry of Education and Human Resources Development, was named by the former Minister of Education, who enhanced its function in 2001 because the administration of Kim Dae-jung considered education and human resources development as a matter of the highest priority. As a result of the reform, it began to cover the whole field of human resource development and the minister of education was appointed to the Vice Prime Minister.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} In 2008, the name was changed into the present one after the Lee Myeong Bak administration annexed the former Ministry of Science and Technology to the Education ministry. \nLike other ministers, the Minister of Education, Science and Technology is appointed by the president. They are mainly chosen from candidates who have an academic background and often resign in a fairly short term (around one year).{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}\n(Ministry of Education has no more work on science and technology because President Park restorated the Ministry works for science and technology)\n\n===Teachers' union===\nAlthough primary- and secondary-school teachers traditionally enjoyed high status, they often were overworked and underpaid during the late 1980s. Salaries were less than those for many other white-collar professions and even some blue-collar jobs. High school teachers, particularly those in the cities, however, received sizable gifts from parents seeking attention for their children, but teaching hours were long and classes crowded (the average class contained around fifty to sixty students).\n\nIn May 1989, teachers established an independent union, the [[Korean Teachers and Education Workers Union|Korean Teachers Union]] (KTU \u2014 ????????(???), ''Jeongyojo''). Their aims included improving working conditions and reforming a school system that they regarded as overly controlled by the Ministry of Education. Although the government promised large increases in allocations for teachers' salaries and facilities, it refused to give the union legal status. Because teachers were civil servants, the government claimed they did not have the right to strike and, even if they did have the right to strike, unionization would undermine the status of teachers as \"role models\" for young Koreans. The government also accused the union of spreading subversive, leftist propaganda that was sympathetic to the communist regime in North Korea.\n\nAccording to a report in ''[[The Wall Street Journal Asia]]'', the union claimed support from 82 percent of all teachers. The controversy was viewed as representing a major crisis for South Korean education because a large number of teachers (1,500 by November 1989) had been dismissed, violence among union supporters, opponents, and police had occurred at several locations, and class disruptions had caused anxieties for families of students preparing for the college entrance examinations. The union's challenge to the Ministry of Education's control of the system and the charges of subversion had made compromise seem a very remote possibility at the start 1990.<!-- What happened after 1990? -->\n\n===Political involvement in the education system===\nSouth Korea still has issues with North Korea after the [[Korean War]]. This has contributed to South Korea's confrontational stance against North Korea in the education field. For instance, on July 7, 2011, the [[National Intelligence Service (South Korea)|National Intelligence Service]] was criticized for the [[search and seizure]] of a civilian think tank, Korea Higher Education Research Institution (?????????).<ref>{{cite news |first=O-seong (??) |last=Kwon (?) | script-title=ko:???, '?? ???' ?? ???? ???? |date=2011-07-09 |url=http://www.hani.co.kr/arti/society/society_general/486615.html |work=The Hankyeoreh |accessdate=2011-07-26 |language=Korean}}</ref> This incident was carried out through a warrant to investigate an alleged South Korean spy who followed an instruction from North Korea with a purpose of instigating university student rallies to stop the ongoing tuition hike in South Korea.\n\n==English education==\nKorea, which is considered the most difficult Asian nation of people to communicate with in English, has an extensive English education history dating back to the Joseon Dynasty. During this time,  Koreans received English education in public institutes, where translators were instructed for conversion of Korean into foreign languages. The Public Foreign Language School established in 1893, educated young males to perform tasks to modernize Korea. This school, unlike facilities such as Yuk Young Gong Won (1886), disregarded social statuses, welcoming more students into the institute and introducing the first Korean foreign language instructors into the field of English education (Chang, 2009).\n\nEnglish was also taught during the Joseon Dynasty in missionary schools, which were established to spread the word of the Christian faith to Koreans, although these schools did not equip its students with the necessary tools to read, write, comprehend and speak the language. Direct Method teaching was uncommon, as instructors were often unqualified as English teachers and the textbook was limited to the Holy Bible. During the Japanese Imperialism Period, Koreans were forced to prioritize the learning and speaking of Japanese. English was offered only as an elective course, though, the instructors were often Japanese, hindering proper English pronunciation. After the liberation of Korea from Japan in 1945, the first national curriculum was established in 1955, launching greater pursuit of English education and returning the nation to speaking its native tongue.\n\nThe relevance of early English education and globalization were brought to the attention of South Korea during the 1986 Asian Games and Seoul Olympic Games, as many came to realize the value of the English language. English is taught as a required subject from the third year of elementary school up to high school, as well as in most universities, with the goal of performing well on the [[TOEIC]] and [[TOEFL]], which are tests of reading, listening and grammar-based English.  For students who achieve high scores, there is also a speaking evaluation. Universities began lecturing in English to help improve competence and though only few were competent enough themselves to lead a class, many elementary school teachers were also recommended to teach in English.\n\nIn 1994, the university entrance examination moved away from testing grammar, towards a more communicative method. Parents redirected the focus of English education to align with exam content (Park, 2009). English Language Education programs focus on ensuring competency to perform effectively as a nation in an era of globalization using proficiency-based language programs that allow students to learn according to their own abilities and interests and driving Koreans to focus more on oral proficiency (Chang, 2009 & Park, 2009). With the new focus placed on oral expertise, there has been an \"intense desire to speak native-like English\" pressuring parents to take measures to ensure the most beneficial English education (Park, 2009).\n\nBecause of large class sizes and other factors in public schools, many parents pay to send their children to private English-language schools in the afternoon or evening. Families invest significant portions of household incomes on the education of children to include English camps and language training abroad. Usually different private English-language schools specialize in teaching elementary school students or in middle and high school students. The most ambitious parents send their children to kindergartens that utilize English exclusively in the classroom. Many children also live abroad for anywhere from a few months to several years to learn English. Sometimes, a Korean mother and her children will move to an English-speaking country for an extended period of time to enhance the children's English ability. In these cases, the father left in Korea is known as a [[gireogi appa]] (Korean: \uae30\ub7ec\uae30 \uc544\ube60), literally a \"goose dad\" who must migrate to see his family.<ref name=english>{{cite news |last=Onishi |first=Norimitsu |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/08/world/asia/08geese.html |title=For English Studies, Koreans Say Goodbye to Dad |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=8 June 2008}}</ref>\n\nThere are more than 100,000 Korean students in the U.S. The increase of 10 percent every year helped Korea remain the top student-sending country in the U.S. for a second year, ahead of India and China. Korean students at Harvard University are the third most after Canadian and Chinese. In 2012, 154,000 South Korean students were pursuing degrees at overseas universities, with countries such as Japan, Canada, the United States, and Australia as top destinations.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://monitor.icef.com/2013/08/south-korean-student-mobility-takes-a-dip/ |title=South Korean student mobility takes a dip |publisher=ICEF |accessdate=19 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nKorean English classes focus on vocabulary, grammar, and reading. Academies tend to include conversation, and some offer debate and presentation.\n\nDue to recent curriculum changes, the education system in Korea is now placing a greater emphasis on English verbal abilities rather than grammatical skills. With influence from the government, English education began to focus on the communicative competence of Korean students emphasizing fluency and comprehension through listening materials. Universities require all first year students to take an English conversation class in their first year and some universities require students to take conversational English classes throughout the entirety of their university life.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} According to a 2003 survey conducted by the Hong Kong-based Political and Economic Risk Consultancy, despite being one of the countries in Asia that spends the most money on English-language education, South Korea ranks the lowest among 12 Asian countries in English ability.<!-- dead link: [http://www.straitstimes.com/Latest%2BNews/Asia/STIStory_205075.html straitstimes] -->\n\nEnglish as a subject discipline, that is, the study of linguistics, literature, composition/rhetoric, or pedagogy is uncommon except in top-tier or graduate programs in Korea. As a result, despite efforts to recruit foreign faculty in Korean universities, opportunities for tenure are fewer and professorial privileges and salaries are lower than for foreigners contracted to teach major disciplinary courses in English ([[content-based instruction]]). Overall, more native English speakers are being employed as educators in Korea to improve the English education process. Koreans have come to believe native English speakers are the best teachers of the language and to be proficient in the English language gives their children an advantage over others and is an \"educational investment that promises surplus\"(Han, 2007).\n\n==Controversy and criticism==\n\n===Students' health===\nSouth Korea's scarcity of natural resources is often cited as a reason for the rigorousness and fierce competition of its school systems; the academic pressure on its students is arguably the largest in the world. In an article entitled \"An Assault Upon Our Children,\" Se-Woong Koo wrote that \"the system's dark side casts a long shadow. Dominated by tiger moms, cram schools and highly authoritarian teachers, South Korean education produces ranks of overachieving students who pay a stiff price in health and happiness. The entire program amounts to child abuse. It should be reformed and restructured without delay.\"<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/02/opinion/sunday/south-koreas-education-system-hurts-students.html |title=An Assault Upon Our Children |last=Koo |first=Se-Woong |work=The New York Times |date=1 August 2014}}</ref> In a response to the article, educator [[Diane Ravitch]] warned against modeling an educational system in which children \"exist either to glorify the family or to build the national economy.\" She argued furthermore that the happiness of South Korean children has been sacrificed, and likened the country's students to \"cogs in a national economic machine\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://dianeravitch.net/2014/08/03/why-we-should-not-copy-education-in-south-korea/ |title=Why We Should Not Copy Education in South Korea |last=Ravitch |first=Diane |date=August 3, 2014 |accessdate=November 25, 2015}}</ref> A 2014 poll found that over half of South Korean teenagers have suicidal thoughts, with over 40% of respondents reporting that school pressure and future uncertainty dismayed them the most.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/korearealtime/2014/03/20/poll-shows-half-of-korean-teenagers-have-suicidal-thoughts/ |title=Poll Shows Half of Korean Teenagers Have Suicidal Thoughts |last=Kang |first=Yewon |newspaper=The Wall-Street Journal |date=March 20, 2014 |accessdate=August 6, 2016}}</ref> Furthermore, suicide is currently the leading cause of death among South Korean youth.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/national/2015/04/28/11/0302000000AEN20150428004700320F.html |title=Suicide No. 1 cause of death for S.

(Fenaroli Partimento No. 1, Book 1, Gj1301)]]\n[[File:Fenaroli Partimento Fugue 8, Book 5, Gj1418.jpg|thumb|right|500px| A partimenti fugue for more advanced students. As students progressed, partimenti became unfigured. (Fenaroli Partimento Fugue 8, Book 5, Gj1418)]]\n\nA '''Partimento''' (from the [[Italian language|Italian]]: partimento, plural partimenti) is a sketch (often a bass line), written out on a single staff, whose main purpose is to be a guide for the improvisation (\"realization\") of a composition at the keyboard.{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=14}} Partimento differs from [[accompaniment|accompaniment]] in that the result is a complete, fully-realized composition.{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=167}}\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Durante.jpg|thumb|Francesco Durante]]\n[[File:Leonardo Leo.jpg|thumb|Leonardo Leo]]\n\n=== Beginnings ===\nThe Partimenti evolved in the late 17th century in educational milieus in Bologna, Rome, and Naples. \n\n=== Golden Age ===\nThe golden age of partimento was presided over by [[Francesco Durante|Francesco Durante]] and [[Leonardo Leo|Leonardo Leo]], the 2nd generation of Neapolitan masters.{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=67}} Many important Italian composers emerged from the musical institutions in Naples, Bologna, and Milano, such as [[Giovanni Battista Pergolesi]], [[Giuseppe Verdi]], [[Domenico Cimarosa]], [[Vincenzo Bellini]], [[Gaetano Donizetti]], [[Gaspare Spontini]] and [[Gioachino Rossini]].\n\n=== Influence on Paris Conservatory ===\n\n=== Decline and Disappearance ===\n\n=== Revival ===\nThe rediscovery of the partimento tradition in modern research since around 2000 has enabled new ways of looking at the musical education and composing practice in the 18th and 19th centuries. Today, partimento studies provide an important impetus for a more integrative approach to learning counterpoint, harmony, and improvisation.\n\n== How Partimento was Taught ==\n\n{{Quote|text=To begin with, one will play all unfigured basses with simple consonant chords: from that performance the Master will clearly understand if his pupil has correctly understood the principles thereof. Secondly, one shall introduce all feasible dissonances for that given bass. Lastly, one shall shape the properly said imitation.|author=Emanuele Guarnaccia|title=''Metodo nuovamente riformato de'partimenti'', 3, 1825 ca|source={{sfn|Guarnaccia|1825|p=3}}}}\n\nPartimenti were typically used as exercises to train conventional models of [[voice leading]], [[harmony]], and musical form, such as the so-called [[Rule of the octave|Rule of the Octave]] (the harmonized scale), [[Cadence (music)|cadences]] and [[Sequence (music)|sequences]] (the movimenti, or moti del basso). The beginners\u2019 partimenti treatises usually present rules, which are then followed by exercises of increasing difficulty, presenting [[figured bass]]  as well as [[unfigured bass]] lines, and culminating in the advanced exercises of imitative partimenti and partimento [[fugue|fugues]].\n\n=== Harmony vs Counterpoint ===\nThere is no strict separation between [[counterpoint]] and harmony in the Partimento tradition.\n\n== Consonances and Dissonances ==\nMusic is composed of consonances and dissonances.{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=2}}\n\n=== Consonances ===\nThe four consonances are the 3rd, 5th, 6th and 8th. The 5th and 8th are '''perfect consonances''' because one cannot make distinctions between them by expanding them with a sharp or diminishing them with a flat. The 3rd and 6th are considered '''imperfect consonances''' because one can make distinctions between them.{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=2}}\n\n<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n   {\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\new Voice \\relative c' {\n                \\stemDown \\clef bass \\key g \\major \\time 4/4 \\tempo 2 = 60 \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t\n                <g b>1^\\markup { \\center-column { 3rd } }  \\bar \"||\" <d a'>^\\markup { \\center-column { 5th } } \\bar \"||\" <b g'>^\\markup { \\center-column { 6th } }  \\bar \"||\"<g g'>^\\markup { \\center-column { 8th } }\n                }\n            >>\n     }\n</score>\n\n=== Dissonances ===\nThe four dissonances are the 2nd, 4th, 7th and 9th. They were invented to make the consonances sound more beautiful.

As students progressed, partimenti became unfigured. (Fenaroli Partimento Fugue 8, Book 5, Gj1418)]]\n\nA '''Partimento''' (from the [[Italian language|Italian]]: partimento, plural partimenti) is a sketch (often a bass line), written out on a single staff, whose main purpose is to be a guide for the improvisation (\"realization\") of a composition at the keyboard.{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=14}} Partimento differs from [[accompaniment|accompaniment]] in that the result is a complete, fully-realized composition.{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=167}}\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Durante.jpg|thumb|Francesco Durante]]\n[[File:Leonardo Leo.jpg|thumb|Leonardo Leo]]\n\n=== Beginnings ===\nThe Partimenti evolved in the late 17th century in educational milieus in Bologna, Rome, and Naples. \n\n=== Golden Age ===\nThe golden age of partimento was presided over by [[Francesco Durante|Francesco Durante]] and [[Leonardo Leo|Leonardo Leo]], the 2nd generation of Neapolitan masters.{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=67}} Many important Italian composers emerged from the musical institutions in Naples, Bologna, and Milano, such as [[Giovanni Battista Pergolesi]], [[Giuseppe Verdi]], [[Domenico Cimarosa]], [[Vincenzo Bellini]], [[Gaetano Donizetti]], [[Gaspare Spontini]] and [[Gioachino Rossini]].\n\n=== Influence on Paris Conservatory ===\n\n=== Decline and Disappearance ===\n\n=== Revival ===\nThe rediscovery of the partimento tradition in modern research since around 2000 has enabled new ways of looking at the musical education and composing practice in the 18th and 19th centuries. Today, partimento studies provide an important impetus for a more integrative approach to learning counterpoint, harmony, and improvisation.\n\n== How Partimento was Taught ==\n\n{{Quote|text=To begin with, one will play all unfigured basses with simple consonant chords: from that performance the Master will clearly understand if his pupil has correctly understood the principles thereof. Secondly, one shall introduce all feasible dissonances for that given bass. Lastly, one shall shape the properly said imitation.|author=Emanuele Guarnaccia|title=''Metodo nuovamente riformato de'partimenti'', 3, 1825 ca|source={{sfn|Guarnaccia|1825|p=3}}}}\n\nPartimenti were typically used as exercises to train conventional models of [[voice leading]], [[harmony]], and musical form, such as the so-called [[Rule of the octave|Rule of the Octave]] (the harmonized scale), [[Cadence (music)|cadences]] and [[Sequence (music)|sequences]] (the movimenti, or moti del basso). The beginners\u2019 partimenti treatises usually present rules, which are then followed by exercises of increasing difficulty, presenting [[figured bass]]  as well as [[unfigured bass]] lines, and culminating in the advanced exercises of imitative partimenti and partimento [[fugue|fugues]].\n\n=== Harmony vs Counterpoint ===\nThere is no strict separation between [[counterpoint]] and harmony in the Partimento tradition.\n\n== Consonances and Dissonances ==\nMusic is composed of consonances and dissonances.{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=2}}\n\n=== Consonances ===\nThe four consonances are the 3rd, 5th, 6th and 8th. The 5th and 8th are '''perfect consonances''' because one cannot make distinctions between them by expanding them with a sharp or diminishing them with a flat.
