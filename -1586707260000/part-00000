One day, the son of his gardener, Gordon Ngubene ([[Winston Ntshona]]), gets beaten by the white police after he gets caught by the police during a peaceful demonstration for a better education policy for black people in South Africa. Gordon asks Ben for help. After Ben refuses to help because of his trust in the police, Gordon gets caught by the police as well and is tortured by Captain Stolz ([[J\u00fcrgen Prochnow]]). Against the will of his family, Ben tries to find out more about the disappearance of his gardener by himself. Following the discoveries of the murders of both Gordon and his son by the police, Ben decides to bring this incident up before a court with Ian McKenzie ([[Marlon Brando]]) as lawyer but loses. Afterwards, he continues to act by himself and supports a small group of black people, including his driver Stanley Makhaya ([[Zakes Mokae]]), to interview others to promote social change. \n\nThe white police notice their intentions and detain some responsible persons. To file a civil suit, Ben collects affidavits and hides the information at his house. Ben lets his son in on his plans. His son and his daughter both get to know the hiding spots, and after the police search through Ben's house, there is an explosion next to the hiding spot because the daughter betrayed it to the police, but the son saved the documents. Gordon's wife, Emily (Thoko Ntshinga), is killed when she refuses to be evicted from her home. Ben's wife and daughter leave him. The daughter offers to her father to get the documents to a safer place.\n\nThey meet at a restaurant and Ben gives his daughter unbeknownst-to-her fake documents, which she delivers to Captain Stolz. Instead of giving her the documents, Ben passed her a book about art. At the end, Ben is run over by Stolz, who is later shot by Stanley in revenge.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Donald Sutherland]] as Ben du Toit\n* [[Janet Suzman]] as Susan du Toit\n* [[Susannah Harker]] as Suzette du Toit\n* Rowen Elmes as Johan du Toit\n* [[Marlon Brando]] as Ian McKenzie\n* [[Susan Sarandon]] as Melanie Bruwer\n* [[Leonard Maguire]] as Prof. Bruwer\n* [[Zakes Mokae]] as Stanley Makhaya\n* [[Winston Ntshona]] as Gordon Ngubene\n* Thoko Ntshinga as Emily Ngubene\n* Bekhithemba Mpofu as Jonathan Ngubene\n* [[J\u00fcrgen Prochnow]] as Captain Stolz\n* [[Michael Gambon]] as Magistrate\n* [[John Kani]] as Julius\n* [[Gerard Thoolen]] as Colonel Viljoen\n* [[David de Keyser]] as Susan's father\n\n==Production==\nBefore production, [[Warner Brothers]] passed on the project and it went to [[MGM]].\n\nDirector Euzhan Palcy was so passionate about creating an accurate portrayal on film that she traveled to Soweto undercover, posing as a recording artist, to research the riots.<ref>{{cite web|title=Euzhan Palcy: The first black female director produced by a major Hollywood studio. |url=http://www.martinique.org/euzhan-palcy/ |publisher=Experience Martinique |accessdate=3 March 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130315030833/http://www.martinique.org/euzhan-palcy/ |archivedate=15 March 2013 }}</ref> Actor Brando was so moved by Palcy's commitment to social change that he came out of a self-imposed retirement to play the role of the human rights lawyer; he also agreed to work for union scale ($4,000), far below his usual fee.

The daughter offers to her father to get the documents to a safer place.\n\nThey meet at a restaurant and Ben gives his daughter unbeknownst-to-her fake documents, which she delivers to Captain Stolz. Instead of giving her the documents, Ben passed her a book about art. At the end, Ben is run over by Stolz, who is later shot by Stanley in revenge.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Donald Sutherland]] as Ben du Toit\n* [[Janet Suzman]] as Susan du Toit\n* [[Susannah Harker]] as Suzette du Toit\n* Rowen Elmes as Johan du Toit\n* [[Marlon Brando]] as Ian McKenzie\n* [[Susan Sarandon]] as Melanie Bruwer\n* [[Leonard Maguire]] as Prof. Bruwer\n* [[Zakes Mokae]] as Stanley Makhaya\n* [[Winston Ntshona]] as Gordon Ngubene\n* Thoko Ntshinga as Emily Ngubene\n* Bekhithemba Mpofu as Jonathan Ngubene\n* [[J\u00fcrgen Prochnow]] as Captain Stolz\n* [[Michael Gambon]] as Magistrate\n* [[John Kani]] as Julius\n* [[Gerard Thoolen]] as Colonel Viljoen\n* [[David de Keyser]] as Susan's father\n\n==Production==\nBefore production, [[Warner Brothers]] passed on the project and it went to [[MGM]].\n\nDirector Euzhan Palcy was so passionate about creating an accurate portrayal on film that she traveled to Soweto undercover, posing as a recording artist, to research the riots.<ref>{{cite web|title=Euzhan Palcy: The first black female director produced by a major Hollywood studio. |url=http://www.martinique.org/euzhan-palcy/ |publisher=Experience Martinique |accessdate=3 March 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130315030833/http://www.martinique.org/euzhan-palcy/ |archivedate=15 March 2013 }}</ref> Actor Brando was so moved by Palcy's commitment to social change that he came out of a self-imposed retirement to play the role of the human rights lawyer; he also agreed to work for union scale ($4,000), far below his usual fee.

This led to a change in paella's ingredients, as well, using instead rabbit, chicken, duck and sometimes snails. This dish became so popular that in 1840, a local Spanish newspaper first used the word ''paella'' to refer to the recipe rather than the pan.<ref name=\"foodtimeline.org\" />\n\nThe most widely used, complete ingredient list of this era was: short-grain white rice, chicken, rabbit, snails (optional), duck (optional), [[White beans|butter beans]], [[White beans|great northern beans]], [[runner beans]], [[artichoke]] (a substitute for runner beans in the winter), [[tomato]]es, fresh rosemary, sweet [[paprika]], [[saffron]], [[garlic]] (optional), salt, olive oil, and water.<ref name=\"foodtimeline.org\" /> Poorer Valencians, however, sometimes used nothing more than snails for meat. Valencians insist that only these ingredients should go into making modern ''paella valenciana''.\n\n=== Seafood and mixed ''paella''===\nOn the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] coast, Valencians used seafood instead of meat and beans to make paella. Valencians regard this recipe as authentic, as well. In this recipe, the seafood is served in the shell. A variant of this is ''paella del senyoret'' which uses seafood without shells. Later, however, Spaniards living outside of Valencia combined seafood with meat from land animals and mixed ''paella'' was born.<ref name=\"arrozsos.com\">{{cite web |author=Tu nombre |url=http://www.arrozsos.com/articulos/ver/historia_de_la_paella |title=Arroz SOS presents a history of paella |publisher=Arrozsos.com |accessdate=19 February 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100125102334/http://www.arrozsos.com/Articulos/ver/historia_de_la_paella |archivedate=25 January 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> This ''paella'' is sometimes called ''preparaci\u00f3n barroca'' (baroque preparation) due to the variety of ingredients and its final presentation.<ref>{{cite web|title=Nuestras Paellas|url=http://www.pacharan.com.uy/platos/paellas/|website=Pachar\u00e1n|accessdate=2 September 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151116111929/http://www.pacharan.com.uy/platos/paellas/|archivedate=16 November 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nDuring the 20th century, paella's popularity spread past Spain's borders. As other cultures set out to make paella, the dish invariably acquired regional influences. Consequently, ''paella'' recipes went from being relatively simple to including a wide variety of seafood, meat, sausage (including [[chorizo]]),<ref>[http://www.oprah.com/food/Paella Mario Batali's version of mixed paella with chorizo] Oprah.com: Retrieved 30 June 2011</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Recipe courtesy Tyler Florence |url=http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/tyler-florence/paella-with-seafood-chicken-and-chorizo-recipe/index.html |title=Foodnetwork's paella recipe with seafood, chicken and chorizo |publisher=Foodnetwork.com |date= |accessdate=19 February 2010}}</ref> vegetables and many different seasonings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spain-recipes.com/paellarecipes.html |title=An assortment of paella recipes |publisher=Spain-recipes.com |date= |accessdate=19 February 2010}}</ref> However, the most globally popular recipe is seafood paella.\n\nThroughout non-Valencia Spain, mixed ''paella'' is relatively easy to find.

This led to a change in paella's ingredients, as well, using instead rabbit, chicken, duck and sometimes snails. This dish became so popular that in 1840, a local Spanish newspaper first used the word ''paella'' to refer to the recipe rather than the pan.<ref name=\"foodtimeline.org\" />\n\nThe most widely used, complete ingredient list of this era was: short-grain white rice, chicken, rabbit, snails (optional), duck (optional), [[White beans|butter beans]], [[White beans|great northern beans]], [[runner beans]], [[artichoke]] (a substitute for runner beans in the winter), [[tomato]]es, fresh rosemary, sweet [[paprika]], [[saffron]], [[garlic]] (optional), salt, olive oil, and water.<ref name=\"foodtimeline.org\" /> Poorer Valencians, however, sometimes used nothing more than snails for meat. Valencians insist that only these ingredients should go into making modern ''paella valenciana''.\n\n=== Seafood and mixed ''paella''===\nOn the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] coast, Valencians used seafood instead of meat and beans to make paella. Valencians regard this recipe as authentic, as well. In this recipe, the seafood is served in the shell. A variant of this is ''paella del senyoret'' which uses seafood without shells. Later, however, Spaniards living outside of Valencia combined seafood with meat from land animals and mixed ''paella'' was born.<ref name=\"arrozsos.com\">{{cite web |author=Tu nombre |url=http://www.arrozsos.com/articulos/ver/historia_de_la_paella |title=Arroz SOS presents a history of paella |publisher=Arrozsos.com |accessdate=19 February 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100125102334/http://www.arrozsos.com/Articulos/ver/historia_de_la_paella |archivedate=25 January 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> This ''paella'' is sometimes called ''preparaci\u00f3n barroca'' (baroque preparation) due to the variety of ingredients and its final presentation.<ref>{{cite web|title=Nuestras Paellas|url=http://www.pacharan.com.uy/platos/paellas/|website=Pachar\u00e1n|accessdate=2 September 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151116111929/http://www.pacharan.com.uy/platos/paellas/|archivedate=16 November 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nDuring the 20th century, paella's popularity spread past Spain's borders.

Cody Poulton, describes Hirata's style as an emphasis of the Greek idea of ''ethos'', \"the prevalent tone of sentiment of a people or community; the genius of an institution or system.\"<ref name=\"Poulton mjt\" />\n\n==Interdisciplinary work==\n\nAfter working at Obirin University as a theater professor, Oriza Hirata moved to work for [[Osaka University]], where he collaborated in the scientific fields of communication-design and robotics.<ref>\"Oriza Hirata.\" ORIZA HIRATA: SEINENDAN. Seinendan, n.d.

While his work has been used to generally fulfill this role, he has also brought his work in robotics back to the theater, where he has incorporated robots in plays to explore themes of humanity. His play, ''I, Worker'' uses two robots as main characters to explore this very idea. He has collaborated with robotics expert [[Hiroshi Ishiguro]] for his theatrical experiments using robots.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Posner|first1=Dassia N.|last2=Orenstein|first2=Claudia|last3=Bell|first3=John|title=The Routledge Companion to Puppetry and Material Performance|date=2014|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=978-0-415-70540-0|page=282}}</ref>\n\n==International work and acclaim==\n\nShortly after beginning his career as a playwright, Oriza Hirata has had a prolific international career\u2014both touring his work around the world, as well as staging foreign playwrights work at his own theater in Japan.\n\nBeginning in the early 2000s, Hirata's work started to garner international attention. With the help of Japan's Saison Foundation, a grant-making foundation that supports Japanese Theater, and [[Manhattan]]'s [[Nonprofit organization]] [[Japan Society (Manhattan)|Japan Society]], Hirata's most famous work, ''T\u014dky\u014d Notes'' was debuted in the [[United States]] in October 2000 in [[New York City]]. [[Japan Society (Manhattan)|Japan Society]]'s theater series, Japanese Theatre NOW, has helped bring a number of contemporary Japanese dramas to the [[United States]], Hirata's being notable since ''T\u014dky\u014d Notes'' was one of the first.<ref name=Thornbury>{{cite book|last1=Thronbury|first1=Barbara|title=America's Japan and Japan's Performing Arts: Cultural Mobility and Exchange in New York, 1952-2011|date=2013|publisher=The University of Michigan Press|location=Ann Arbor, MI|isbn=978-0-472-11885-4|pages=17\u201319}}</ref>\n\nSince then, Hirata's work and company have traveled much of the world, including [[France]], [[Belgium]], [[Switzerland]], [[Ireland]], [[Germany]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Korea]], [[China]], [[Australia]], and [[Brazil]]. Hirata says that he believes he has \"done the best work in France,\" where \"the people in France have been very enthusiastic about [his] work.\" Both in [[France]] and [[Belgium]], Hirata has collaborated with international actors and directors to bring his theatrical work to an international audience, as well as creating new commissioned work as both a playwright and director.<ref name=International /><ref name=Hirata />\n\nHirata has also collaborated on many international works inside of [[Japan]], using his theater to stage plays by playwrights from [[France]], [[Switzerland]], [[Italy]], [[Spain]], the [[United States]], [[Korea]], and [[China]]. Hirata's admiration for the French theater scene can be seen with these collaborations as well, as he has tended to stage more French plays than any other country he has collaborated with.<ref name=International />\n\nA year after the [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster]], Hirata submitted a 10-minute play, along with 18 other American and Japanese artist, to be performed and documented in an event called Shinsai: Theaters For Japan.<ref name=\"Shinsai web\">{{cite web|title=SHINSAI: Theaters for Japan|url=https://www.tcg.org/shinsai/archive.cfm|website=Theatre Communications Group|publisher=Theatre Communications Group|accessdate=3 June 2015}}</ref> The event happened that the Great Hall at Cooper Union in [[New York City]].

Yenni served as the Director of the Department of Citizens' Affairs in Jefferson Parish from January 2005 to June 2006. On July 1, 2006 he became the 7th Chief Administrative Officer for the City of Kenner for then Mayor Ed Muniz's entire term in office. Yenni's grandfather Joe Yenni was the Mayor of Kenner from 1970\u20131980 and President of Jefferson Parish from 1980 until his death in March 1987. His uncle Mike Yenni was elected in September 1987 succeeding his late father as President of Jefferson Parish until his death in October 1995.\n\n==Political career==\nYenni was elected the 21st Mayor of Kenner in 2010. He was sworn into office on July 1, 2010. Mayor Yenni was  reelected in 2014, with 75% of the vote against 2 other challengers to a second term. In 2015, he was a Republican candidate for President of Jefferson Parish in the October 2015 election, in which he defeated Parish Councilman at Large Elton Lagasse and 3 other candidates in the primary election. Michael Yenni was sworn as the 15th President on January 6, 2016. His administration made advancements towards the parish's success in areas of economic growth and infrastructure enhancements.\n\nHis political career was marred in scandal in October, 2016, when Yenni admitted to sending improper texts to a young adult in video released to the public <ref>https://www.nola.com/news/politics/article_dc0212b4-b012-53fc-9678-9aa7aa556405.html</ref>. The video went viral and led to a failed voter led recall petition and most elected Parish officials to call for Yenni's immediate resignation. The video was released as a response to a claim made in an youth news site The Tab<ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tab</ref> in which a male Brown University student and New Orleans native accused Yenni of sexting him after the accuser graduated from high school. ref>https://www.nola.com/news/politics/article_287d7742-5c6d-58d3-8884-f77d6ed4d891.html</ref>.\n\nThe scandal also led Yenni to be banned from all Jefferson Parish School Board properties and events<ref>https://www.nola.com/news/education/article_9009af31-5b79-5c7a-ab08-a7043bab0cc2.html</ref>\n\nOn August 8, 2019, Yenni announced that he would not seek reelection for a second term as Jefferson Parish President.
