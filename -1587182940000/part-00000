Mueller's MLB playing career was spent with the [[San Francisco Giants]] (1996\u20132000, 2002), [[Chicago Cubs]] (2001\u20132002), [[Boston Red Sox]] (2003\u20132005), and [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] (2006).\n\nA number of Mueller's accomplishments came during the 2003 season, when he won the [[American League]] [[List of Major League Baseball batting champions|batting title]] and a [[Silver Slugger Award]].  A [[switch hitter]], he became the only player in major league history to hit one [[Grand slam (baseball)|grand slam]] from both sides of the plate in the same game on July 29, 2003.  He was the starting third baseman for the Red Sox' [[2004 World Series]] championship team that beat the [[St. Louis Cardinals]]. Since his playing career, he has served in MLB as a front office assistant and hitting coach.\n\n==Playing career==\nMueller was born in [[Maryland Heights, Missouri]], and attended [[De Smet Jesuit High School]] and [[Southwest Missouri State University]]. In 1992, he played [[collegiate summer baseball]] in the [[Cape Cod Baseball League]] for the [[Bourne Braves]].<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://capecodbaseball.org.ismmedia.com/ISM3/std-content/repos/Top/2012website/archives/Current%20Year/All_Time_MLB_CCBL_Alumni.pdf |title=Major League Baseball Players From the Cape Cod League |publisher=capecodbaseball.org |date= |accessdate=January 9, 2020}}</ref> He was drafted by the [[San Francisco Giants]] in the 15th round of the [[1993 Major League Baseball draft|1993 MLB draft]].\n\nMueller made his professional debut with the Giants low A team, the [[Everett Giants]], in 1993 and quickly rose through the Giants farm system, with stops in [[San Jose Giants|San Jose]], [[Shreveport Captains|Shreveport]], and [[Phoenix Firebirds|Phoenix]] before making his major league debut with the Giants as a [[pinch hitter]] on April 18, 1996, against the [[Chicago Cubs]]. He got his first career hit the following day, also as a pinch hitter, against [[Terry Adams (baseball)|Terry Adams]].\n\nHe played third base for the Giants fairly regularly for five seasons, until he was traded to the Chicago Cubs before the 2001 season for pitcher [[Tim Worrell]]. (Given that Mueller had by then settled into the Bay Area year-round, the Giants, out of respect for Mueller, delayed the trade several days so that Mueller could attend the Cal-Stanford football game one last time as a local star.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/sports/ci_6505691|title=Brown: Baseball trade deadline can mean mayhem for players|date=July 31, 2007|publisher=}}</ref>)  He returned to San Francisco in September 2002 in a trade for minor league pitcher Jeff Verplancke. Before the 2003 season, Mueller was signed by the Boston Red Sox as a [[free agent]]. In his first year in Boston, he won the [[American League]] batting title with a .326 [[Batting average (baseball)|average]]. He also set career highs with 45 doubles and 19 home runs. Before 2003, he had never hit more than 10 home runs or 29 doubles in any season.\n\nHe contributed nearly half of his career home runs during his three years with the Red Sox. Mueller developed a reputation for consistency throughout the major leagues. For five of his ten years in the major leagues, his batting average was between .290 and .295. His minor league numbers were very much the same, consistently between .290 and .310.\n\nMueller joined the Los Angeles Dodgers for the 2006 season and was reunited with former Boston teammate [[Nomar Garciaparra]], but played only 32 games before undergoing his third knee surgery, which would prove to be career-ending. Doctors ruled out all known procedures to repair the deteriorating condition in his right knee.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/news/article.jsp?ymd=20060720&content_id=1567061&vkey=news_la&fext=.jsp&c_id=la&partnered=rss_la|title=Mueller stymied|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nIn 1216 games over 11 seasons, Mueller posted a .291 [[batting average (baseball)|batting average]] (1229-for-4223) with 663 [[run (baseball)|runs]], 265 [[double (baseball)|doubles]], 22 [[triple (baseball)|triples]], 85 [[home runs]], 493 [[RBI]], 543 [[bases on balls]], .373 [[on-base percentage]] and .425 [[slugging percentage]]. He finished his career with a .958 [[fielding percentage]] playing at third and second base. In 36 postseason games, he hit .234 (34-for-145) with 14 runs, 8 doubles, 1 home run, 4 RBI and 13 walks.\n\n==Coaching career==\nOn November 17, 2006, the Dodgers announced that Mueller was retiring from baseball and had been hired as a special assistant to the general manager.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://losangeles.dodgers.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/news/press_releases/press_release.jsp?ymd=20061117&content_id=1742882&vkey=pr_la&fext=.jsp&c_id=la|title=Mueller retires, joins front office|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nOn June 15, 2007, Mueller was named Los Angeles Dodgers interim hitting coach when [[Eddie Murray]] was fired.

He in fact hit three home runs in that game, and his two [[Grand slam (baseball)|grand slams]] were in consecutive at-bats.\n*Hit a dramatic game-winning [[walk-off home run]] on July 24, 2004, against the [[New York Yankees]]. The game had been a seesaw battle featuring a [[bench-clearing brawl]] in which Boston catcher [[Jason Varitek]] and Yankees third baseman [[Alex Rodriguez]] famously clashed after [[Bronson Arroyo]] hit Rodr\u00edguez with a curveball. The game appeared to be another devastating loss for the then stagnant Red Sox, but in the bottom of the ninth, with the Red Sox down a run and Yankees closer [[Mariano Rivera]] on the mound, Mueller hit a 3\u20131 pitch into the Red Sox bullpen in right field, winning the game for the Red Sox. Many baseball analysts considered this game to be the turning point in the Red Sox 2004 season, in which they went on to win the World Series.\n*Made a significant number of contributions to the Red Sox's World Series win in 2004. The most notable was his critical RBI [[Single (baseball)|single]] in the ninth inning of Game 4 against the Yankees in the [[American League Championship Series]]. Down 4\u20133 in the ninth inning and facing elimination, [[Kevin Millar]] drew a [[Base on balls|walk]] from [[Relief pitcher|closer]] [[Mariano Rivera]]. [[Dave Roberts (outfielder)|Dave Roberts]] came in to [[Pinch runner|pinch run]] for Millar and [[Dave Roberts (outfielder)#.22The Steal.22|stole]] second base. Mueller singled him home and the Red Sox went on to win in 12 innings, beginning their run of eight straight wins, culminating in the title.\n*With his former team, the Boston Red Sox, down three games to two in the 2007 American League Championship Series, Bill Mueller was brought in to throw out the ceremonial first pitch of game six to bring back a little of the magic that his hit against the Yankees in 2004 had brought. The Red Sox went on to win the game 12\u20132, the ALCS 4\u20133, and the [[2007 World Series|World Series]].\n*Held a .455 career batting average against Mariano Rivera. Was nicknamed \"The Rivera Slayer\".\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Biography|United States|Baseball}}\n* [[List of Major League Baseball batting champions]]\n* [[List of Major League Baseball single-game grand slam leaders]]\n* [[List of St. Louis Cardinals coaches]]\n{{clear}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Baseballstats|mlb=119482|espn=3426|br=m/muellbi02|fangraphs=295|brm=muelle004wil|retro=M/Pmuelb001}}\n:<br>\n\n{{S-start}}\n{{Succession box| title=[[Los Angeles Dodgers]] [[coach (baseball)|hitting coach]] | before=[[Eddie Murray]] | years=2007 | after= [[Mike Easler]]}}\n{{succession box|title=[[Chicago Cubs]] [[coach (baseball)|hitting coach]]|years=2014 |before=[[James Rowson]]|after=[[John Mallee]]}}\n{{S-end}}\n{{2004 Boston Red Sox}}\n{{AL batting title}}\n{{AL 3B Silver Slugger Award}}\n{{Missouri Valley Conference Baseball Player of the Year navbox}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Mueller, Bill}}\n[[Category:1971 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:American League batting champions]]\n[[Category:Baseball players from Missouri]]\n[[Category:Boston Red Sox players]]\n[[Category:Bourne Braves players]]\n[[Category:Chicago Cubs coaches]]\n[[Category:Chicago Cubs players]]\n[[Category:Everett Giants players]]\n[[Category:Fresno Grizzlies players]]\n[[Category:Iowa Cubs players]]\n[[Category:Los Angeles Dodgers players]]\n[[Category:Los Angeles Dodgers coaches]]\n[[Category:Los Angeles Dodgers executives]]\n[[Category:Los Angeles Dodgers scouts]]\n[[Category:Major League Baseball hitting coaches]]\n[[Category:Major League Baseball third basemen]]\n[[Category:Missouri State Bears baseball players]]\n[[Category:Missouri State University alumni]]\n[[Category:Pawtucket Red Sox players]]\n[[Category:Phoenix Firebirds players]]\n[[Category:St. Louis Cardinals coaches]]\n[[Category:San Francisco Giants players]]\n[[Category:San Jose Giants players]]\n[[Category:Shreveport Captains players]]\n[[Category:Silver Slugger Award winners]]\n[[Category:Sportspeople from St. Louis County, Missouri]]\n", "text_old": "{{About||the professional wrestler|William Mueller|the 1940s Major League Baseball player|Bill Mueller (outfielder)}}\n{{short description|American baseball player and coach}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=June 2013}}\n{{Infobox baseball biography\n| name       = Bill Mueller\n| image      = Bill Mueller.JPG\n| caption    = Mueller with the Boston Red Sox in September 2005\n| team       = \n| number     = \n| position   = [[Third baseman]]\n| bats       = Switch\n| throws     = Right  \n| birth_date = {{Birth date and age|1971|3|17}}\n| birth_place = [[Maryland Heights, Missouri]]\n|debutleague = MLB\n| debutdate  = April 18\n| debutyear  = 1996\n| debutteam  = San Francisco Giants\n|finalleague = MLB\n| finaldate  = May 11\n| finalyear  = 2006\n| finalteam  = Los Angeles Dodgers\n|statleague = MLB\n| stat1label = [[Batting average (baseball)|Batting average]]\n| stat1value = .291\n| stat2label = [[Home run]]s\n| stat2value = 85\n| stat3label = [[Run batted in|Runs batted in]]\n| stat3value = 493\n|teams=\n* [[San Francisco Giants]] ({{mlby|1996}}\u2013{{mlby|2000}})\n* [[Chicago Cubs]] ({{mlby|2001}}\u2013{{mlby|2002}})\n* [[San Francisco Giants]] ({{mlby|2002}})\n* [[Boston Red Sox]] ({{mlby|2003}}\u2013{{mlby|2005}})\n* [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] ({{mlby|2006}})\n| highlights=\n* [[World Series]] champion ({{wsy|2004}})\n* [[Silver Slugger Award]] (2003)\n* [[List of Major League Baseball batting champions|AL batting champion]] (2003)\n}}\n'''William Richard Mueller''' ({{IPAc-en|\u02c8|m|\u026a|l|\u0259r}};<ref>{{cite web|title=Bill Mueller Stats \u2013 ESPN|url=http://espn.go.com/mlb/player/stats/_/id/3426/bill-mueller|publisher=ESPM|accessdate=October 25, 2012}}</ref> born March 17, 1971) is an [[Americans|American]] retired [[professional baseball]] [[third baseman]] who played in [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB).

He got his first career hit the following day, also as a pinch hitter, against [[Terry Adams (baseball)|Terry Adams]].\n\nHe played third base for the Giants fairly regularly for five seasons, until he was traded to the Chicago Cubs before the 2001 season for pitcher [[Tim Worrell]]. (Given that Mueller had by then settled into the Bay Area year-round, the Giants, out of respect for Mueller, delayed the trade several days so that Mueller could attend the Cal-Stanford football game one last time as a local star.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/sports/ci_6505691|title=Brown: Baseball trade deadline can mean mayhem for players|date=July 31, 2007|publisher=}}</ref>)  He returned to San Francisco in September 2002 in a trade for minor league pitcher Jeff Verplancke. Before the 2003 season, Mueller was signed by the Boston Red Sox as a [[free agent]]. In his first year in Boston, he won the [[American League]] batting title with a .326 [[Batting average (baseball)|average]]. He also set career highs with 45 doubles and 19 home runs. Before 2003, he had never hit more than 10 home runs or 29 doubles in any season.\n\nHe contributed nearly half of his career home runs during his three years with the Red Sox. Mueller developed a reputation for consistency throughout the major leagues. For five of his ten years in the major leagues, his batting average was between .290 and .295. His minor league numbers were very much the same, consistently between .290 and .310.\n\nMueller joined the Los Angeles Dodgers for the 2006 season and was reunited with former Boston teammate [[Nomar Garciaparra]], but played only 32 games before undergoing his third knee surgery, which would prove to be career-ending.

He in fact hit three home runs in that game, and his two [[Grand slam (baseball)|grand slams]] were in consecutive at-bats.\n*Hit a dramatic game-winning [[walk-off home run]] on July 24, 2004 against the [[New York Yankees]]. The game had been a seesaw battle featuring a [[bench-clearing brawl]] in which Boston catcher [[Jason Varitek]] and Yankees third baseman [[Alex Rodriguez]] famously clashed after [[Bronson Arroyo]] hit Rodr\u00edguez with a curveball. The game appeared to be another devastating loss for the then stagnant Red Sox, but in the bottom of the ninth, with the Red Sox down a run and Yankees closer [[Mariano Rivera]] on the mound, Mueller hit a 3\u20131 pitch into the Red Sox bullpen in right field, winning the game for the Red Sox. Many baseball analysts considered this game to be the turning point in the Red Sox 2004 season, in which they went on to win the World Series.\n*Made a significant number of contributions to the Red Sox's World Series win in 2004. The most notable was his critical RBI [[Single (baseball)|single]] in the ninth inning of Game 4 against the Yankees in the [[American League Championship Series]]. Down 4-3 in the ninth inning and facing elimination, [[Kevin Millar]] drew a [[Base on balls|walk]] from [[Relief pitcher|closer]] [[Mariano Rivera]]. [[Dave Roberts (outfielder)|Dave Roberts]] came in to [[Pinch runner|pinch run]] for Millar and [[Dave Roberts (outfielder)#.22The Steal.22|stole]] second base. Mueller singled him home and the Red Sox went on to win in 12 innings, beginning their run of eight straight wins, culminating in the title.\n*With his former team, the Boston Red Sox, down three games to two in the 2007 American League Championship Series, Bill Mueller was brought in to throw out the ceremonial first pitch of game six to bring back a little of the magic that his hit against the Yankees in 2004 had brought. The Red Sox went on to win the game 12\u20132, the ALCS 4\u20133, and the [[2007 World Series|World Series]].\n*Held a .455 career batting average against Mariano Rivera. Was nicknamed \"The Rivera Slayer\".\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Biography|United States|Baseball}}\n* [[List of Major League Baseball batting champions]]\n* [[List of Major League Baseball single-game grand slam leaders]]\n* [[List of St. Louis Cardinals coaches]]\n{{clear}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Baseballstats|mlb=119482|espn=3426|br=m/muellbi02|fangraphs=295|brm=muelle004wil|retro=M/Pmuelb001}}\n:<br>\n\n{{S-start}}\n{{Succession box| title=[[Los Angeles Dodgers]] [[coach (baseball)|hitting coach]] | before=[[Eddie Murray]] | years=2007 | after= [[Mike Easler]]}}\n{{succession box|title=[[Chicago Cubs]] [[coach (baseball)|hitting coach]]|years=2014 |before=[[James Rowson]]|after=[[John Mallee]]}}\n{{S-end}}\n{{2004 Boston Red Sox}}\n{{AL batting title}}\n{{AL 3B Silver Slugger Award}}\n{{Missouri Valley Conference Baseball Player of the Year navbox}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Mueller, Bill}}\n[[Category:1971 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:American League batting champions]]\n[[Category:Baseball players from Missouri]]\n[[Category:Boston Red Sox players]]\n[[Category:Bourne Braves players]]\n[[Category:Chicago Cubs coaches]]\n[[Category:Chicago Cubs players]]\n[[Category:Everett Giants players]]\n[[Category:Fresno Grizzlies players]]\n[[Category:Iowa Cubs players]]\n[[Category:Los Angeles Dodgers players]]\n[[Category:Los Angeles Dodgers coaches]]\n[[Category:Los Angeles Dodgers executives]]\n[[Category:Los Angeles Dodgers scouts]]\n[[Category:Major League Baseball hitting coaches]]\n[[Category:Major League Baseball third basemen]]\n[[Category:Missouri State Bears baseball players]]\n[[Category:Missouri State University alumni]]\n[[Category:Pawtucket Red Sox players]]\n[[Category:Phoenix Firebirds players]]\n[[Category:St. Louis Cardinals coaches]]\n[[Category:San Francisco Giants players]]\n[[Category:San Jose Giants players]]\n[[Category:Shreveport Captains players]]\n[[Category:Silver Slugger Award winners]]\n[[Category:Sportspeople from St. Louis County, Missouri]]\n", "name_user": "Dmoore5556", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eHighlights:punctuation", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Mueller"}

Founded on the same date was the Abidjan Center for Higher Education (\"''Centre d\u2019enseignement sup\u00e9rieur d\u2019Abidjan''\").\n\nOn 9 January 1964 the government of C\u00f4te d'Ivoire fused the institutions and promoted them to the rank of university.<ref name=ha>[http://www.histoire-afrique.org/rubrique66.html C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090307013401/http://www.histoire-afrique.org/rubrique66.html |date=7 March 2009 }}: d\u00e9partement d\u2019histoire de l\u2019universit\u00e9 de Cocody-Abidjan. histoire-afrique.org. 28 septembre 2007</ref> The public university system was, until reorganization in 1996, known as the '''University of Abidjan''', with the '''University of Abidjan-Cocody''' as the largest of three campuses.\n\nIn the reorganization of August 1996, each of the three main campuses became independent universities, accountable directly to the Ivorian Ministry of Education.

Painting by Swedish artist [[Richard Bergh]], 1887.]]\nIn this environment, the writings of [[Emanuel Swedenborg]] (1688\u20131772) and the teachings of [[Franz Mesmer]] (1734\u20131815) provided an example for those seeking direct personal knowledge of the afterlife. Swedenborg, who claimed to communicate with spirits while awake, described the structure of the spirit world. Two features of his view particularly resonated with the early Spiritualists: first, that there is not a single Hell and a single Heaven, but rather a series of higher and lower heavens and hells; second, that spirits are intermediates between God and humans, so that the divine sometimes uses them as a means of communication.<ref name=\"Carroll\" />  Although Swedenborg warned against seeking out spirit contact, his works seem to have inspired in others the desire to do so.\n\nSwedenborg was formerly a highly regarded inventor and scientist, achieving several engineering innovations and studying physiology and anatomy. Then, \u201cin 1741, he also began to have a series of intense mystical experiences, dreams, and visions, claiming that he had been called by God to reform Christianity and introduce a new church.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Urban |first1=Hugh B. |title=New Age, Neopagan and New Religious Movements |location=Oakland, California |publisher=University of California Press |year=2015 |isbn=978-0520281189 }}</ref>\n\nMesmer did not contribute religious beliefs, but he brought a technique, later known as [[hypnotism]], that it was claimed could induce trances and cause subjects to report contact with supernatural beings. There was a great deal of professional showmanship inherent to demonstrations of [[Animal magnetism|Mesmerism]], and the practitioners who lectured in mid-19th-century North America sought to entertain their audiences as well as to demonstrate methods for personal contact with the divine.<ref name=\"Carroll\" />\n\nPerhaps the best known of those who combined Swedenborg and Mesmer in a peculiarly North American synthesis was [[Andrew Jackson Davis]], who called his system the \"harmonial philosophy\". Davis was a practising [[Mesmerist]], [[faith healing|faith healer]] and [[clairvoyance|clairvoyant]] from [[Blooming Grove, New York]]. He was also strongly influenced by the socialist theories of [[Fourierism]].<ref>Catherine Albanese. (2007). ''A Republic of Mind and Spirit. A Cultural History of American Metaphysical Religion''.

On that date, [[Fox sisters|Kate and Margaret Fox]], of [[Arcadia, New York|Hydesville, New York]], reported that they had made contact with a spirit that was later claimed to be the spirit of a murdered peddler whose body was found in the house, though no record of such a person was ever found. The spirit was said to have communicated through rapping noises, audible to onlookers. The evidence of the senses appealed to practically-minded Americans, and the Fox sisters became a sensation. As the first celebrity mediums, the sisters quickly became famous for their public s\u00e9ances in New York.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Talking to the dead : Kate and Maggie Fox and the rise of spiritualism|last=Barbara.|first=Weisberg|date=2004|publisher=HarperSanFrancisco|isbn=9780060566678|edition=1st|location=[San Francisco]|oclc=54939577}}</ref> However, in 1888 the Fox sisters admitted that this \"contact\" with the spirit was a hoax, though shortly afterward they recanted that admission.<ref name=\"Carroll\" /><ref name=\"Braude\" />\n\n[[Amy and Isaac Post]], [[Elias Hicks|Hicksite Quakers]] from [[Rochester, New York]], had long been acquainted with the Fox family, and took the two girls into their home in the late spring of 1848. Immediately convinced of the veracity of the sisters' communications, they became early converts and introduced the young mediums to their circle of radical [[Quaker]] friends.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Radical spirits : spiritualism and women's rights in nineteenth-century America|last=Ann.|first=Braude|date=2001|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=978-0253215024|edition=2nd|location=Bloomington|oclc=47785582}}</ref>\n[[File:CoraLVHatch.jpg|upright|thumb|right|[[Cora L.

These reformers were uncomfortable with more prominent churches because those churches did little to fight [[slavery]] and even less to advance the cause of [[women's rights]].<ref name=\"Braude\" />\n\nSuch links with reform movements, often radically socialist, had already been prepared in the 1840s, as the example of [[Andrew Jackson Davis]] shows. After 1848, many socialists became ardent spiritualists or occultists.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1080/0048721X.2016.1146926|title = Socialist religion and the emergence of occultism: A genealogical approach to socialism and secularization in 19th-century France| journal=Religion| volume=46| issue=3| pages=359\u2013388|year = 2016|last1 = Strube|first1 = Julian}}</ref> Socialist ideas, especially in the [[Fourierism|Fourierist]] vein, exerted a decisive influence on [[Allan Kardec|Kardec]] and other Spiritists.\n\nThe most popular trance lecturer prior to the [[American Civil War]] was [[Cora L. V. Scott]] (1840\u20131923). Young and beautiful, her appearance on stage fascinated men. Her audiences were struck by the contrast between her physical girlishness and the eloquence with which she spoke of spiritual matters, and found in that contrast support for the notion that spirits were speaking through her. Cora married four times, and on each occasion adopted her husband's last name. During her period of greatest activity, she was known as Cora Hatch.<ref name=\"Braude\" />\n\nAnother famous woman Spiritualist was [[Achsa W. Sprague]], who was born November 17, 1827, in [[Plymouth Notch|Plymouth Notch, Vermont]]. At the age of 20, she became ill with [[rheumatic fever]] and credited her eventual recovery to intercession by spirits. An extremely popular trance lecturer, she traveled about the United States until her death in 1861. Sprague was an [[abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] and an advocate of [[women's rights]].<ref name=\"Braude\" />\n\nYet another prominent Spiritualist and trance medium prior to the [[Civil War (U.S.)|Civil War]] was [[Paschal Beverly Randolph]] (1825\u20131875), a man of mixed race, who also played a part in the [[abolitionist]] movement.<ref name=\"Deveney\">{{cite book\n | last = Deveney\n | first = John Patrick\n | year = 1997\n | title = Paschal Beverly Randolph: A Nineteenth-Century Black American Black American Spiritualist, Rosicrucian, and Sex Magician\n | publisher = Sunny Press\n | isbn = 978-0-7914-3119-1}}</ref> Nevertheless, many abolitionists and reformers held themselves aloof from the Spiritualist movement; among the skeptics was the famous abolitionist [[Frederick Douglass]].<ref name=\"PBS\">''Telegrams from the Dead'' (a [[PBS]] television [[documentary film|documentary]] in the \"[[American Experience]]\" series, first aired October 19, 1994).</ref>\n\nAnother social reform movement with significant Spiritualist involvement was the effort to improve conditions of Native Americans. As Kathryn Troy notes in a study of Indian ghosts in seances:\n\n<blockquote>Undoubtedly, on some level Spiritualists recognized the Indian spectres that appeared at seances as a symbol of the sins and subsequent guilt of the United States in its dealings with Native Americans. Spiritualists were literally haunted by the presence of Indians. But for many that guilt was not assuaged: rather, in order to confront the haunting and rectify it, they were galvanized into action. The political activism of Spiritualists on behalf of Indians was thus the result of combining white guilt and fear of divine judgment with a new sense of purpose and responsibility.<ref>Kathryn Troy, ''The Specter of the Indian. SUNY 2017. p.151.</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Believers and skeptics===\nIn the years following the sensation that greeted the Fox sisters, demonstrations of mediumship (s\u00e9ances and [[automatic writing]], for example) proved to be a profitable venture, and soon became popular forms of entertainment and spiritual catharsis. The Fox sisters were to earn a living this way and others would follow their lead.<ref name=\"Carroll\" /><ref name=\"Braude\" /> Showmanship became an increasingly important part of spiritualism, and the visible, audible, and tangible evidence of spirits escalated as mediums competed for paying audiences. As independent investigating commissions repeatedly established, most notably the 1887 report of the [[Seybert Commission]],<ref>[http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/11950 ''Preliminary Report of the Commission Appointed by the University of Pennsylvania''], The Seybert Commission, 1887. 2004-04-01.</ref> fraud was widespread, and some of these cases were prosecuted in the courts.<ref>[[Montagu Williams|Williams, Montagu Stephen]]. 1891.

Prominent in the ranks of its adherents were those grieving the death of a loved one. Many families during the time of the American Civil War had seen their men go off and never return, and images of the battlefield, produced through the new medium of photography, demonstrated that their loved ones had not only died in overwhelmingly huge numbers, but horribly as well. One well known case is that of [[Mary Todd Lincoln]] who, grieving the loss of her son, organized s\u00e9ances in the [[White House]] which were attended by her husband, President [[Abraham Lincoln]].<ref name=\"PBS\" /> The surge of Spiritualism during this time, and later during [[World War I]], was a direct response to those massive battlefield casualties.<ref name=\"DoyleVol1\">Arthur Conan Doyle, [http://www.classic-literature.co.uk/scottish-authors/arthur-conan-doyle/the-history-of-spiritualism-vol-i/ ''The History of Spiritualism Vol I''], Arthur Conan Doyle, 1926.</ref>\n\nIn addition, the movement appealed to reformers, who fortuitously found that the spirits favoured such causes ''du jour'' as abolition of slavery, and equal rights for women.<ref name=\"Braude\" /> It also appealed to some who had a [[materialism|materialist]] orientation and rejected organized religion.  In 1854 the [[Utopian socialism|utopian socialist]] [[Robert Owen]] was converted to Spiritualism after \"sittings\" with the American medium Maria B. Hayden (credited with introducing Spiritualism to England); Owen made a public profession of his new faith in his publication ''The Rational quarterly review'' and later wrote a pamphlet, ''The future of the Human race; or great glorious and future revolution to be effected through the agency of departed spirits of good and superior men and women.<ref>[[Lewis Spence]], ''Encyclopedia of Occultism and Parapsychology'', Kessinger Publishing Company, 2003, p. 679.</ref>\n\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nImage:Frank Podmore.jpg|[[Frank Podmore]], ca. 1895.\nFile:Portrait of Sir William Crookes (1832 - 1919), chemist Wellcome M0002308.jpg|[[William Crookes]].

Among the most important were the weeklies the ''[[Banner of Light]]'' (Boston), the ''Religio-Philosophical Journal'' (Chicago), ''Mind and Matter'' (Philadelphia), the ''Spiritualist'' (London), and the ''Medium'' (London). Other influential periodicals were the ''Revue Spirite'' (France), ''Le Messager'' (Belgium), ''Annali dello Spiritismo'' (Italy), ''El Criterio Espiritista'' (Spain), and the ''Harbinger of Light'' (Australia). By 1880, there were about three dozen monthly Spiritualist periodicals published around the world.<ref>(Harrison 1880: 6)</ref> These periodicals differed a great deal from one another, reflecting the great differences among Spiritualists. Some, such as the British ''Spiritual Magazine'' were Christian and conservative, openly rejecting the reform currents so strong within Spiritualism. Others, such as ''Human Nature'', were pointedly non-Christian and supportive of socialism and reform efforts. Still others, such as the ''Spiritualist'', attempted to view Spiritualist phenomena from a scientific perspective, eschewing discussion on both theological and reform issues.<ref>(Alvarado, Biondi, and Kramer 2006: 61\u201363)</ref>\n\nBooks on the supernatural were published for the growing middle class, such as 1852's  ''Mysteries'', by Charles Elliott, which contains \"sketches of spirits and spiritual things\", including accounts of the [[Salem witch trials]], the [[Lane ghost]], and the [[Fox sisters|Rochester rappings]].<ref>Charles Wyllys Elliott, ''Mysteries, or Glimpses of the Supernatural'', Harper & Bros: New York, 1852.</ref>\n''The Night Side of Nature'', by Catherine Crowe, published in 1853, provided definitions and accounts of wraiths, doppelg\u00e4ngers, apparitions and haunted houses.<ref>Catherine Crowe, ''The Night Side of Nature, or Ghosts and Ghost-seers'', Redfield: New York, 1853.</ref>\n\nMainstream newspapers treated stories of ghosts and haunting as they would any other news story.

Broadly speaking the concept of evolution fitted the spiritualist thought of the progressive development of humanity. At the same time, however, the belief in the animal origins of humanity threatened the foundation of the immortality of the [[spirit]], for if humans had not been created by God, it was scarcely plausible that they would be specially endowed with spirits. This led to Spiritualists embracing [[spiritual evolution]].<ref>Janet Oppenheim, The Other World: Spiritualism and Psychical Research in England, 1850\u20131914, 1988, p. 267</ref>\n\nThe Spiritualists' view of evolution did not stop at death. Spiritualism taught that after death spirits progressed to spiritual states in new spheres of existence. According to Spiritualists evolution occurred in the [[Spirit world (Spiritualism)|spirit world]] \"at a rate more rapid and under conditions more favourable to growth\" than encountered on earth.<ref name=\"Janet Oppenheim 1914, p. 270\">Janet Oppenheim, The Other World: Spiritualism and Psychical Research in England, 1850\u20131914, 1988, p. 270</ref>\n\nIn a talk at the London Spiritualist Alliance, [[John Page Hopps]] (1834\u20131911) supported both evolution and Spiritualism. Hopps claimed humanity had started off imperfect \"out of the animal's darkness\" but would rise into the \"angel's marvellous light\". Hopps claimed humans were not fallen but rising creatures and that after death they would evolve on a number of spheres of existence to perfection.<ref name=\"Janet Oppenheim 1914, p. 270\"/>\n\n[[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]] is in opposition to the spiritualist interpretation of evolution. Theosophy teaches a metaphysical theory of evolution mixed with [[human devolution]]. Spiritualists do not accept the devolution of the theosophists.  To theosophy humanity starts in a state of perfection (see [[Golden age]]) and falls into a process of progressive materialization (devolution), developing the mind and losing the spiritual consciousness. After the gathering of experience and growth through repeated [[reincarnations]] humanity will regain the original spiritual state, which is now one of self-conscious perfection.\n\nTheosophy and Spiritualism were both very popular metaphysical schools of thought especially in the early 20th century and thus were always clashing in their different beliefs. [[Madame Blavatsky]] was critical of Spiritualism; she distanced theosophy from Spiritualism as far as she could and allied herself with eastern occultism.<ref>G. Baseden Butt, Madame Blavatsky, p. 120</ref>\n\n[[File:Gerald Massey 1856.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Gerald Massey]]]]\n\nThe Spiritualist [[Gerald Massey]] claimed that [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]'s theory of evolution was incomplete:\n\n<blockquote>The theory contains only one half the explanation of man's origins and needs spiritualism to carry it through and complete it. For while this ascent on the physical side has been progressing through myriads of ages, the Divine descent has also been going on\u2014man being spiritually an incarnation from the Divine as well as a human development from the animal creation. The cause of the development is spiritual. Mr. Darwin's theory does not in the least militate against ours\u2014we think it necessitates it; he simply does not deal with our side of the subject. He can not go lower than the dust of the earth for the matter of life; and for us, the main interest of our origin must lie in the spiritual domain.<ref>Gerald Massey, ''Concerning Evolution'', p. 55</ref></blockquote>\n\nSpiritualists believed that without Spiritualism \"the doctrine of Darwin is a broken link\". Gerald Massey said \"Spiritualism will accept evolution, and carry it out and make both ends meet in the perfect circle\".<ref>Gerald Massey, Concerning evolution, pp.&nbsp;60\u201361</ref>\n\nA famous medium who rejected evolution was [[Cora L. V. Scott]];  she dismissed evolution in her lectures and instead supported a type of [[pantheistic]] Spiritualism.<ref>Frank Podmore, Bob Gilbert, Modern spiritualism: a history and a criticism: Volume 2, 2001, pp.&nbsp;135\u2013136</ref>\n\n[[Alfred Russel Wallace]] believed qualitative novelties could arise through the process of spiritual evolution, in particular the phenomena of life and mind. Wallace attributed these novelties to a [[supernatural]] agency.<ref>Debora Hammond, The Science of Synthesis: Exploring the Social Implications of General Systems Theory, 2003, p. 39</ref> Later in his life, Wallace was an advocate of Spiritualism and believed in an immaterial origin for the higher mental faculties of humans;  he believed that evolution suggested that the universe had a purpose, and that certain aspects of living organisms are not explainable in terms of purely materialistic processes, in a 1909 magazine article entitled \"The World of Life\", which he later expanded into a book of the same name.<ref>{{cite web|last=Wallace|first=Alfred Russel|title=World of Life|url=http://people.wku.edu/charles.smith/wallace/S669.htm|publisher=The Alfred Russel Wallace Page hosted by [[Western Kentucky University]]|accessdate=2011-03-23}}</ref> Wallace argued in his 1911 book ''World of Life'' for a spiritual approach to evolution and described evolution as \"creative power, directive mind and ultimate purpose\". Wallace believed [[natural selection]] could not explain [[intelligence]] or [[morality]] in the human being so suggested that non-material spiritual forces accounted for these. Wallace believed the spiritual nature of humanity could not have come about by natural selection alone, the origins of the spiritual nature must originate \"in the unseen universe of spirit\".<ref>Martin Fichman, An elusive Victorian: the evolution of Alfred Russel Wallace, 2004, p. 159</ref><ref>Edward Clodd, Question: A Brief History and Examination of Modern Spiritualism, p. 300</ref>\n\n[[Oliver Lodge]] also promoted a version of spiritual evolution in his books ''Man and the Universe'' (1908), ''Making of Man'' (1924) and ''Evolution and Creation'' (1926). The spiritualist element in the synthesis was most prominent in Lodge's 1916 book ''Raymond, or Life and Death'' which revived a large interest for the public in the paranormal.<ref>Peter J. Bowler, Science for all: the popularization of science in early twentieth-century, 2009, p. 44</ref>\n\n==After the 1920s==\n{{Main|Spiritualist Church|Spiritualists' National Union|Survivalism (life after death)|Spiritualist Association of Great Britain}}\n\nAfter the 1920s, Spiritualism evolved in three different directions, all of which exist today.\n\n===Syncretism===\nThe first of these continued the tradition of individual practitioners, organised in circles centered on a medium and clients, without any hierarchy or dogma. Already by the late 19th century Spiritualism had become increasingly [[syncretism|syncretic]], a natural development in a movement without central authority or dogma.<ref name=\"Braude\" /> Today, among these unorganised circles, Spiritualism is similar to the new age movement. However, [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophy]] with its inclusion of Eastern religion, astrology, ritual magic and reincarnation is an example of a closer precursor of the 20th century new age movement.<ref name=\"Hess_p20\">{{cite book\n  | last = Hess\n  | first = David J.\n  | title = Science In The New Age: The Paranormal, Its Defenders & Debunkers\n  | publisher = University of Wisconsin Press\n  | date = June 15, 1993\n  | page = 20\n  | isbn = 978-0-299-13820-2 }}\n</ref> Today's syncretic Spiritualists are quite heterogeneous in their beliefs regarding issues such as reincarnation or the existence of God. Some appropriate new age and neo-pagan beliefs, while others call themselves \"Christian spiritualists\", continuing with the tradition of cautiously incorporating spiritualist experiences into their Christian faith.\n\n===Spiritualist church===\n{{Main|Spiritualist church|Spiritualists' National Union|Spiritualist Association of Great Britain|Spiritual church movement}}\nThe second direction taken has been to adopt formal organization, patterned after Christian denominations, with established liturgies and a set of seven principles, and training requirements for mediums. In the United States the spiritualist churches are primarily affiliated either with the [[National Spiritualist Association of Churches]] or the loosely allied group of denominations known as the spiritual church movement; in the U.K. the predominant organization is the [[Spiritualists' National Union]], founded in 1890.\n[[File:Conan doyle.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Arthur Conan Doyle]], creator of [[Sherlock Holmes]]]]\nFormal education in spiritualist practice emerged in 1920s, with organizations like the William T. Stead Center in Chicago, Illinois, and continue today with the [[Arthur Findlay]] College at Stansted Hall in England, and the [[National Spiritualist Association of Churches|Morris Pratt Institute]] in Wisconsin, United States.\n\nDiversity of belief among organized Spiritualists has led to a few schisms, the most notable occurring in the U.K. in 1957 between those who held the movement to be a religion ''sui generis'' (of its own with unique characteristics), and a minority who held it to be a denomination within Christianity. In the United States, this distinction can be seen between the less Christian organization, the National Spiritualist Association of Churches, and the more Christian spiritual church movement.\n\nThe practice of organized Spiritualism today resembles that of any other religion, having discarded most showmanship, particularly those elements resembling the conjurer's art. There is thus a much greater emphasis on \"mental\" mediumship and an almost complete avoidance of the apparently miraculous \"materializing\" mediumship that so fascinated early believers such as Arthur Conan Doyle.<ref name=\"Cassadaga\" /> The first Spiritualist church in Australia was the United Stanmore & Enmore Spiritualist Church<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.enmorespiritualistchurch.org.au/|title=Enmore Spiritualist Church|website=Enmore Spiritualist Church}}</ref> established in 1913. In 1921, Conan Doyle gave a farewell to Australia speech there.\n\n===Psychical research===\n{{Main|Parapsychology}}\n\nAlready as early as 1882, with the founding of the [[Society for Psychical Research]] (SPR), parapsychologists emerged to investigate spiritualist claims.<ref>[[Ray Hyman]].

Painting by Swedish artist [[Richard Bergh]], 1887.]]\nIn this environment, the writings of [[Emanuel Swedenborg]] (1688\u20131772) and the teachings of [[Franz Mesmer]] (1734\u20131815) provided an example for those seeking direct personal knowledge of the afterlife. Swedenborg, who claimed to communicate with spirits while awake, described the structure of the spirit world. Two features of his view particularly resonated with the early Spiritualists: first, that there is not a single Hell and a single Heaven, but rather a series of higher and lower heavens and hells; second, that spirits are intermediates between God and humans, so that the divine sometimes uses them as a means of communication.<ref name=\"Carroll\" />  Although Swedenborg warned against seeking out spirit contact, his works seem to have inspired in others the desire to do so.\n\nSwedenborg was formerly a highly regarded inventor and scientist, achieving several engineering innovations and studying physiology and anatomy. Then, \u201cin 1741, he also began to have a series of intense mystical experiences, dreams, and visions, claiming that he had been called by God to reform Christianity and introduce a new church.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Urban |first1=Hugh B. |title=New Age, Neopagan and New Religious Movements |location=Oakland, California |publisher=University of California Press |year=2015 |isbn=978-0520281189 }}</ref>\n\nMesmer did not contribute religious beliefs, but he brought a technique, later known as [[hypnotism]], that it was claimed could induce trances and cause subjects to report contact with supernatural beings. There was a great deal of professional showmanship inherent to demonstrations of [[Animal magnetism|Mesmerism]], and the practitioners who lectured in mid-19th-century North America sought to entertain their audiences as well as to demonstrate methods for personal contact with the divine.<ref name=\"Carroll\" />\n\nPerhaps the best known of those who combined Swedenborg and Mesmer in a peculiarly North American synthesis was [[Andrew Jackson Davis]], who called his system the \"harmonial philosophy\". Davis was a practising [[Mesmerist]], [[faith healing|faith healer]] and [[clairvoyance|clairvoyant]] from [[Blooming Grove, New York]]. He was also strongly influenced by the socialist theories of [[Fourierism]].<ref>Catherine Albanese. (2007). ''A Republic of Mind and Spirit. A Cultural History of American Metaphysical Religion''.

On that date, [[Fox sisters|Kate and Margaret Fox]], of [[Arcadia, New York|Hydesville, New York]], reported that they had made contact with a spirit that was later claimed to be the spirit of a murdered peddler whose body was found in the house, though no record of such a person was ever found. The spirit was said to have communicated through rapping noises, audible to onlookers. The evidence of the senses appealed to practically-minded Americans, and the Fox sisters became a sensation. As the first celebrity mediums, the sisters quickly became famous for their public s\u00e9ances in New York.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Talking to the dead : Kate and Maggie Fox and the rise of spiritualism|last=Barbara.|first=Weisberg|date=2004|publisher=HarperSanFrancisco|isbn=9780060566678|edition=1st|location=[San Francisco]|oclc=54939577}}</ref> However, in 1888 the Fox sisters admitted that this \"contact\" with the spirit was a hoax, though shortly afterward they recanted that admission.<ref name=\"Carroll\" /><ref name=\"Braude\" />\n\n[[Amy and Isaac Post]], [[Elias Hicks|Hicksite Quakers]] from [[Rochester, New York]], had long been acquainted with the Fox family, and took the two girls into their home in the late spring of 1848. Immediately convinced of the veracity of the sisters' communications, they became early converts and introduced the young mediums to their circle of radical [[Quaker]] friends.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Radical spirits : spiritualism and women's rights in nineteenth-century America|last=Ann.|first=Braude|date=2001|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=978-0253215024|edition=2nd|location=Bloomington|oclc=47785582}}</ref>\n[[File:CoraLVHatch.jpg|upright|thumb|right|[[Cora L.

These reformers were uncomfortable with more prominent churches because those churches did little to fight [[slavery]] and even less to advance the cause of [[women's rights]].<ref name=\"Braude\" />\n\nSuch links with reform movements, often radically socialist, had already been prepared in the 1840s, as the example of [[Andrew Jackson Davis]] shows. After 1848, many socialists became ardent spiritualists or occultists.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1080/0048721X.2016.1146926|title = Socialist religion and the emergence of occultism: A genealogical approach to socialism and secularization in 19th-century France| journal=Religion| volume=46| issue=3| pages=359\u2013388|year = 2016|last1 = Strube|first1 = Julian}}</ref> Socialist ideas, especially in the [[Fourierism|Fourierist]] vein, exerted a decisive influence on [[Allan Kardec|Kardec]] and other Spiritists.\n\nThe most popular trance lecturer prior to the [[American Civil War]] was [[Cora L. V. Scott]] (1840\u20131923). Young and beautiful, her appearance on stage fascinated men. Her audiences were struck by the contrast between her physical girlishness and the eloquence with which she spoke of spiritual matters, and found in that contrast support for the notion that spirits were speaking through her. Cora married four times, and on each occasion adopted her husband's last name. During her period of greatest activity, she was known as Cora Hatch.<ref name=\"Braude\" />\n\nAnother famous woman Spiritualist was [[Achsa W. Sprague]], who was born November 17, 1827, in [[Plymouth Notch|Plymouth Notch, Vermont]]. At the age of 20, she became ill with [[rheumatic fever]] and credited her eventual recovery to intercession by spirits. An extremely popular trance lecturer, she traveled about the United States until her death in 1861. Sprague was an [[abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] and an advocate of [[women's rights]].<ref name=\"Braude\" />\n\nYet another prominent Spiritualist and trance medium prior to the [[Civil War (U.S.)|Civil War]] was [[Paschal Beverly Randolph]] (1825\u20131875), a man of mixed race, who also played a part in the [[abolitionist]] movement.<ref name=\"Deveney\">{{cite book\n | last = Deveney\n | first = John Patrick\n | year = 1997\n | title = Paschal Beverly Randolph: A Nineteenth-Century Black American Black American Spiritualist, Rosicrucian, and Sex Magician\n | publisher = Sunny Press\n | isbn = 978-0-7914-3119-1}}</ref> Nevertheless, many abolitionists and reformers held themselves aloof from the Spiritualist movement; among the skeptics was the famous abolitionist [[Frederick Douglass]].<ref name=\"PBS\">''Telegrams from the Dead'' (a [[PBS]] television [[documentary film|documentary]] in the \"[[American Experience]]\" series, first aired October 19, 1994).</ref>\n\nAnother social reform movement with significant Spiritualist involvement was the effort to improve conditions of Native Americans. As Kathryn Troy notes in a study of Indian ghosts in seances:\n\n<blockquote>Undoubtedly, on some level Spiritualists recognized the Indian spectres that appeared at seances as a symbol of the sins and subsequent guilt of the United States in its dealings with Native Americans. Spiritualists were literally haunted by the presence of Indians. But for many that guilt was not assuaged: rather, in order to confront the haunting and rectify it, they were galvanized into action. The political activism of Spiritualists on behalf of Indians was thus the result of combining white guilt and fear of divine judgment with a new sense of purpose and responsibility.<ref>Kathryn Troy, ''The Specter of the Indian. SUNY 2017. p.151.</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Believers and skeptics===\nIn the years following the sensation that greeted the Fox sisters, demonstrations of mediumship (s\u00e9ances and [[automatic writing]], for example) proved to be a profitable venture, and soon became popular forms of entertainment and spiritual catharsis. The Fox sisters were to earn a living this way and others would follow their lead.<ref name=\"Carroll\" /><ref name=\"Braude\" /> Showmanship became an increasingly important part of spiritualism, and the visible, audible, and tangible evidence of spirits escalated as mediums competed for paying audiences. As independent investigating commissions repeatedly established, most notably the 1887 report of the [[Seybert Commission]],<ref>[http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/11950 ''Preliminary Report of the Commission Appointed by the University of Pennsylvania''], The Seybert Commission, 1887. 2004-04-01.</ref> fraud was widespread, and some of these cases were prosecuted in the courts.<ref>[[Montagu Williams|Williams, Montagu Stephen]]. 1891.

Prominent in the ranks of its adherents were those grieving the death of a loved one. Many families during the time of the American Civil War had seen their men go off and never return, and images of the battlefield, produced through the new medium of photography, demonstrated that their loved ones had not only died in overwhelmingly huge numbers, but horribly as well. One well known case is that of [[Mary Todd Lincoln]] who, grieving the loss of her son, organized s\u00e9ances in the [[White House]] which were attended by her husband, President [[Abraham Lincoln]].<ref name=\"PBS\" /> The surge of Spiritualism during this time, and later during [[World War I]], was a direct response to those massive battlefield casualties.<ref name=\"DoyleVol1\">Arthur Conan Doyle, [http://www.classic-literature.co.uk/scottish-authors/arthur-conan-doyle/the-history-of-spiritualism-vol-i/ ''The History of Spiritualism Vol I''], Arthur Conan Doyle, 1926.</ref>\n\nIn addition, the movement appealed to reformers, who fortuitously found that the spirits favoured such causes ''du jour'' as abolition of slavery, and equal rights for women.<ref name=\"Braude\" /> It also appealed to some who had a [[materialism|materialist]] orientation and rejected organized religion.  In 1854 the [[Utopian socialism|utopian socialist]] [[Robert Owen]] was converted to Spiritualism after \"sittings\" with the American medium Maria B. Hayden (credited with introducing Spiritualism to England); Owen made a public profession of his new faith in his publication ''The Rational quarterly review'' and later wrote a pamphlet, ''The future of the Human race; or great glorious and future revolution to be effected through the agency of departed spirits of good and superior men and women.<ref>[[Lewis Spence]], ''Encyclopedia of Occultism and Parapsychology'', Kessinger Publishing Company, 2003, p. 679.</ref>\n\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nImage:Frank Podmore.jpg|[[Frank Podmore]], ca. 1895.\nFile:Portrait of Sir William Crookes (1832 - 1919), chemist Wellcome M0002308.jpg|[[William Crookes]].

Among the most important were the weeklies the ''[[Banner of Light]]'' (Boston), the ''Religio-Philosophical Journal'' (Chicago), ''Mind and Matter'' (Philadelphia), the ''Spiritualist'' (London), and the ''Medium'' (London). Other influential periodicals were the ''Revue Spirite'' (France), ''Le Messager'' (Belgium), ''Annali dello Spiritismo'' (Italy), ''El Criterio Espiritista'' (Spain), and the ''Harbinger of Light'' (Australia). By 1880, there were about three dozen monthly Spiritualist periodicals published around the world.<ref>(Harrison 1880: 6)</ref> These periodicals differed a great deal from one another, reflecting the great differences among Spiritualists. Some, such as the British ''Spiritual Magazine'' were Christian and conservative, openly rejecting the reform currents so strong within Spiritualism. Others, such as ''Human Nature'', were pointedly non-Christian and supportive of socialism and reform efforts. Still others, such as the ''Spiritualist'', attempted to view Spiritualist phenomena from a scientific perspective, eschewing discussion on both theological and reform issues.<ref>(Alvarado, Biondi, and Kramer 2006: 61\u201363)</ref>\n\nBooks on the supernatural were published for the growing middle class, such as 1852's  ''Mysteries'', by Charles Elliott, which contains \"sketches of spirits and spiritual things\", including accounts of the [[Salem witch trials]], the [[Lane ghost]], and the [[Fox sisters|Rochester rappings]].<ref>Charles Wyllys Elliott, ''Mysteries, or Glimpses of the Supernatural'', Harper & Bros: New York, 1852.</ref>\n''The Night Side of Nature'', by Catherine Crowe, published in 1853, provided definitions and accounts of wraiths, doppelg\u00e4ngers, apparitions and haunted houses.<ref>Catherine Crowe, ''The Night Side of Nature, or Ghosts and Ghost-seers'', Redfield: New York, 1853.</ref>\n\nMainstream newspapers treated stories of ghosts and haunting as they would any other news story. An account in the [[Chicago Tribune|''Chicago Daily Tribune'']] in 1891, \"sufficiently bloody to suit the most fastidious taste\", tells of a house believed to be haunted by the ghosts of three murder victims seeking revenge against their killer's son, who was eventually driven insane.\n\nMany families, \"having no faith in ghosts\", thereafter moved into the house, but all soon moved out again.<ref>\"Dreadful Tale of a Haunted Man in Newton County, Missouri\", ''[[Chicago Daily Tribune]]'', January 4, 1891.</ref>\n\nIn the 1920s many \"psychic\" books were published of varied quality. Such books were often based on excursions initiated by the use of [[Ouija|Ouija boards]]. A few of these popular books displayed unorganized Spiritualism, though most were less insightful.<ref>{{cite book\n  | last = White\n  | first = Stewart Edward\n  | authorlink = Stewart Edward White\n  | title = The Betty Book\n  | publisher = E.

Organisation was therefore slow to appear, and when it did it was resisted by mediums and trance lecturers. Most members were content to attend Christian churches, and particularly [[Universalist Church of America|universalist]] churches harboured many Spiritualists.\n\nAs the Spiritualism movement began to fade, partly through the publicity of fraud accusations and partly through the appeal of religious movements such as [[Christian science]], the [[Spiritualist Church]] was organised.  This church can claim to be the main vestige of the movement left today in the United States.<ref name=\"Carroll\" /><ref name=\"Braude\" />\n\n===Other mediums===\n[[File:Emma Hardinge Britten 1884.png|thumb|upright|[[Emma Hardinge Britten]]]]\nLondon-born [[Emma Hardinge Britten]] (1823\u201399) moved to the United States in 1855 and was active in Spiritualist circles as a trance lecturer and organiser. She is best known as a chronicler of the movement's spread, especially in her 1884 ''Nineteenth Century Miracles: Spirits and Their Work in Every Country of the Earth'', and her 1870 ''Modern American Spiritualism'', a detailed account of claims and investigations of mediumship beginning with the earliest days of the movement.\n\n[[William Stainton Moses]] (1839\u201392) was an [[Anglican]] clergyman who, in the period from 1872 to 1883, filled 24 notebooks with automatic writing, much of which was said to describe conditions in the spirit world. However, [[Frank Podmore]] was skeptical of his alleged ability to communicate with spirits and [[Joseph McCabe]] described Moses as a \"deliberate impostor\", suggesting his [[Apport (paranormal)|apports]] and all of his feats were the result of trickery.<ref>[[Frank Podmore]].

Palladino was said by believers to perform spiritualist phenomena in the dark: levitating tables, producing [[Apport (paranormal)|apports]], and materializing spirits.

He was exposed again in 1880, after which he turned to slate-writing. In this he was exposed by Richard Hodgson and S. J. Davey of the SPR in 1885. Davey, a clever conjuror, was able to duplicate all Eglington's phenomena so perfectly that some Spiritualists, notably Alfred Russel Wallace, insisted that he too was really a genuine medium.\"</ref>\n\nThe [[Bangs Sisters]], Mary \"May\" E.

Broadly speaking the concept of evolution fitted the spiritualist thought of the progressive development of humanity. At the same time, however, the belief in the animal origins of humanity threatened the foundation of the immortality of the [[spirit]], for if humans had not been created by God, it was scarcely plausible that they would be specially endowed with spirits. This led to Spiritualists embracing [[spiritual evolution]].<ref>Janet Oppenheim, The Other World: Spiritualism and Psychical Research in England, 1850\u20131914, 1988, p. 267</ref>\n\nThe Spiritualists' view of evolution did not stop at death. Spiritualism taught that after death spirits progressed to spiritual states in new spheres of existence. According to Spiritualists evolution occurred in the [[Spirit world (Spiritualism)|spirit world]] \"at a rate more rapid and under conditions more favourable to growth\" than encountered on earth.<ref name=\"Janet Oppenheim 1914, p. 270\">Janet Oppenheim, The Other World: Spiritualism and Psychical Research in England, 1850\u20131914, 1988, p. 270</ref>\n\nIn a talk at the London Spiritualist Alliance, [[John Page Hopps]] (1834\u20131911) supported both evolution and Spiritualism. Hopps claimed humanity had started off imperfect \"out of the animal's darkness\" but would rise into the \"angel's marvellous light\". Hopps claimed humans were not fallen but rising creatures and that after death they would evolve on a number of spheres of existence to perfection.<ref name=\"Janet Oppenheim 1914, p. 270\"/>\n\n[[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]] is in opposition to the spiritualist interpretation of evolution. Theosophy teaches a metaphysical theory of evolution mixed with [[human devolution]]. Spiritualists do not accept the devolution of the theosophists.  To theosophy humanity starts in a state of perfection (see [[Golden age]]) and falls into a process of progressive materialization (devolution), developing the mind and losing the spiritual consciousness. After the gathering of experience and growth through repeated [[reincarnations]] humanity will regain the original spiritual state, which is now one of self-conscious perfection.\n\nTheosophy and Spiritualism were both very popular metaphysical schools of thought especially in the early 20th century and thus were always clashing in their different beliefs. [[Madame Blavatsky]] was critical of Spiritualism; she distanced theosophy from Spiritualism as far as she could and allied herself with eastern occultism.<ref>G. Baseden Butt, Madame Blavatsky, p. 120</ref>\n\n[[File:Gerald Massey 1856.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Gerald Massey]]]]\n\nThe Spiritualist [[Gerald Massey]] claimed that [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]'s theory of evolution was incomplete:\n\n<blockquote>The theory contains only one half the explanation of man's origins and needs spiritualism to carry it through and complete it. For while this ascent on the physical side has been progressing through myriads of ages, the Divine descent has also been going on\u2014man being spiritually an incarnation from the Divine as well as a human development from the animal creation. The cause of the development is spiritual. Mr. Darwin's theory does not in the least militate against ours\u2014we think it necessitates it; he simply does not deal with our side of the subject. He can not go lower than the dust of the earth for the matter of life; and for us, the main interest of our origin must lie in the spiritual domain.<ref>Gerald Massey, ''Concerning Evolution'', p. 55</ref></blockquote>\n\nSpiritualists believed that without Spiritualism \"the doctrine of Darwin is a broken link\". Gerald Massey said \"Spiritualism will accept evolution, and carry it out and make both ends meet in the perfect circle\".<ref>Gerald Massey, Concerning evolution, pp.&nbsp;60\u201361</ref>\n\nA famous medium who rejected evolution was [[Cora L. V. Scott]];  she dismissed evolution in her lectures and instead supported a type of [[pantheistic]] Spiritualism.<ref>Frank Podmore, Bob Gilbert, Modern spiritualism: a history and a criticism: Volume 2, 2001, pp.&nbsp;135\u2013136</ref>\n\n[[Alfred Russel Wallace]] believed qualitative novelties could arise through the process of spiritual evolution, in particular the phenomena of life and mind. Wallace attributed these novelties to a [[supernatural]] agency.<ref>Debora Hammond, The Science of Synthesis: Exploring the Social Implications of General Systems Theory, 2003, p. 39</ref> Later in his life, Wallace was an advocate of Spiritualism and believed in an immaterial origin for the higher mental faculties of humans;  he believed that evolution suggested that the universe had a purpose, and that certain aspects of living organisms are not explainable in terms of purely materialistic processes, in a 1909 magazine article entitled \"The World of Life\", which he later expanded into a book of the same name.<ref>{{cite web|last=Wallace|first=Alfred Russel|title=World of Life|url=http://people.wku.edu/charles.smith/wallace/S669.htm|publisher=The Alfred Russel Wallace Page hosted by [[Western Kentucky University]]|accessdate=2011-03-23}}</ref> Wallace argued in his 1911 book ''World of Life'' for a spiritual approach to evolution and described evolution as \"creative power, directive mind and ultimate purpose\". Wallace believed [[natural selection]] could not explain [[intelligence]] or [[morality]] in the human being so suggested that non-material spiritual forces accounted for these. Wallace believed the spiritual nature of humanity could not have come about by natural selection alone, the origins of the spiritual nature must originate \"in the unseen universe of spirit\".<ref>Martin Fichman, An elusive Victorian: the evolution of Alfred Russel Wallace, 2004, p. 159</ref><ref>Edward Clodd, Question: A Brief History and Examination of Modern Spiritualism, p. 300</ref>\n\n[[Oliver Lodge]] also promoted a version of spiritual evolution in his books ''Man and the Universe'' (1908), ''Making of Man'' (1924) and ''Evolution and Creation'' (1926). The spiritualist element in the synthesis was most prominent in Lodge's 1916 book ''Raymond, or Life and Death'' which revived a large interest for the public in the paranormal.<ref>Peter J. Bowler, Science for all: the popularization of science in early twentieth-century, 2009, p. 44</ref>\n\n==After the 1920s==\n{{Main|Spiritualist Church|Spiritualists' National Union|Survivalism (life after death)|Spiritualist Association of Great Britain}}\n\nAfter the 1920s, Spiritualism evolved in three different directions, all of which exist today.\n\n===Syncretism===\nThe first of these continued the tradition of individual practitioners, organised in circles centered on a medium and clients, without any hierarchy or dogma. Already by the late 19th century Spiritualism had become increasingly [[syncretism|syncretic]], a natural development in a movement without central authority or dogma.<ref name=\"Braude\" /> Today, among these unorganised circles, Spiritualism is similar to the new age movement. However, [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophy]] with its inclusion of Eastern religion, astrology, ritual magic and reincarnation is an example of a closer precursor of the 20th century new age movement.<ref name=\"Hess_p20\">{{cite book\n  | last = Hess\n  | first = David J.\n  | title = Science In The New Age: The Paranormal, Its Defenders & Debunkers\n  | publisher = University of Wisconsin Press\n  | date = June 15, 1993\n  | page = 20\n  | isbn = 978-0-299-13820-2 }}\n</ref> Today's syncretic Spiritualists are quite heterogeneous in their beliefs regarding issues such as reincarnation or the existence of God. Some appropriate new age and neo-pagan beliefs, while others call themselves \"Christian spiritualists\", continuing with the tradition of cautiously incorporating spiritualist experiences into their Christian faith.\n\n===Spiritualist church===\n{{Main|Spiritualist church|Spiritualists' National Union|Spiritualist Association of Great Britain|Spiritual church movement}}\nThe second direction taken has been to adopt formal organization, patterned after Christian denominations, with established liturgies and a set of seven principles, and training requirements for mediums. In the United States the spiritualist churches are primarily affiliated either with the [[National Spiritualist Association of Churches]] or the loosely allied group of denominations known as the spiritual church movement; in the U.K. the predominant organization is the [[Spiritualists' National Union]], founded in 1890.\n[[File:Conan doyle.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Arthur Conan Doyle]], creator of [[Sherlock Holmes]]]]\nFormal education in spiritualist practice emerged in 1920s, with organizations like the William T. Stead Center in Chicago, Illinois, and continue today with the [[Arthur Findlay]] College at Stansted Hall in England, and the [[National Spiritualist Association of Churches|Morris Pratt Institute]] in Wisconsin, United States.\n\nDiversity of belief among organized Spiritualists has led to a few schisms, the most notable occurring in the U.K. in 1957 between those who held the movement to be a religion ''sui generis'' (of its own with unique characteristics), and a minority who held it to be a denomination within Christianity. In the United States, this distinction can be seen between the less Christian organization, the National Spiritualist Association of Churches, and the more Christian spiritual church movement.\n\nThe practice of organized Spiritualism today resembles that of any other religion, having discarded most showmanship, particularly those elements resembling the conjurer's art. There is thus a much greater emphasis on \"mental\" mediumship and an almost complete avoidance of the apparently miraculous \"materializing\" mediumship that so fascinated early believers such as Arthur Conan Doyle.<ref name=\"Cassadaga\" /> The first Spiritualist church in Australia was the United Stanmore & Enmore Spiritualist Church<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.enmorespiritualistchurch.org.au/|title=Enmore Spiritualist Church|website=Enmore Spiritualist Church}}</ref> established in 1913. In 1921, Conan Doyle gave a farewell to Australia speech there.\n\n===Psychical research===\n{{Main|Parapsychology}}\n\nAlready as early as 1882, with the founding of the [[Society for Psychical Research]] (SPR), parapsychologists emerged to investigate spiritualist claims.<ref>[[Ray Hyman]].
