This season featured 16 HouseGuests.\n\nThe premise of the series remained largely unchanged from previous editions of the series, in which a group of contestants, known as \"HouseGuests,\" compete to win the series by voting each other off and being the last HouseGuest remaining. Each week, one HouseGuest, known as the Head of Household, must nominate two of their fellow HouseGuests for eviction. The winner of the Power of Veto can remove one of the nominees from the block, forcing the HoH to nominate another HouseGuest. The HouseGuests then vote to evict one of the nominees, and the HouseGuest with the most votes is evicted. When only two HouseGuests remained, the last nine evicted HouseGuests would decide which of them would win the $500,000 prize. \n\nThe September 5, 2013, broadcast marked the show's 500th

For this competition, HouseGuests were put into a tournament-style bracket. The object was to roll a ball down a curved banana and have it land on top of the ice cream sundae. The first HouseGuest to get the ball on the sundae, moved on to the next round. Andy was the winner. Andy was also tasked with picking four HouseGuests as Have-Nots for the week and chose Aaryn, Elissa, GinaMarie, and Helen. On Day 50, Jessie and Spencer were nominated for eviction. Elissa, Amanda, and Helen were picked to play in the veto competition, while McCrae was selected to host. That same day, HouseGuests competed in the \"BBB Movie\" Power of Veto competition. For this competition, HouseGuests were given a few minutes to study three movie sets. They were then asked questions about how many of a certain item there were in a set. If the HouseGuest was confident in their answer, they would \"stay\" for an attempt at winning a movie ticket. The housemate that was closest to the correct answer would receive a movie ticket, while the others were eliminated. If they were not confident they would \"fold\" and stay in the competition regardless of their answer. The first HouseGuest to obtain three movie tickets would be the winner. Andy was the winner. On Day 53, Andy chose not to use the Power of Veto. On Day 56, in a unanimous vote of 6\u20130, Jessie was evicted and became the third jury member.\n\nFollowing Jessie's eviction, Aaryn won her fourth Head of Household of the season in the \"Way Off Broadway\" HoH competition. Later that day, Julie Chen revealed to the audience that one of the four jury members would be coming back on the next weeks eviction night. On Day 57, the HouseGuests competed in the Have-Not competition, \"The Black Box\". In this competition, the HouseGuests had to enter a big, pitch-black box with many crawl spaces and gags, find the key, and exit the black box and hit a button to stop the timer. Amanda, Elissa, GinaMarie, and Helen were the Have-Nots for the week. Aaryn then chose to nominate Elissa and Helen, with Helen being her target. Andy, GinaMarie, and Spencer were selected to play in the Veto competition. On Day 58, Elissa went on to win her second Veto competition of the season. Elissa used the Veto to remove her nomination, and Aaryn nominated Spencer in her stead. On Day 63, Helen was evicted by a vote of 4\u20131, with Elissa being the only one to vote for Spencer.\n\nShortly after Helen's eviction, the remaining HouseGuests and first four jurors competed in the \"Off the Wall\" competition, which functioned as both the HoH and re-entry competition. The HouseGuests and jurors were to stand on platforms and catch balls thrown at them without falling off. The first player overall to catch 10 balls or last to remain standing would be the new HoH, and the first juror to do so would return to the game. Judd was the last juror left standing and returned to the game as a HouseGuest, and Elissa was the first to catch 10 balls and became Head of Household. On Day 64, Elissa nominated Aaryn and McCrae for eviction. On Day 65, Amanda, GinaMarie, and Judd were selected to play in the Veto competition. Amanda won the Veto competition, her first individual competition win of the season. On Day 67, Amanda used the Power of Veto to save McCrae, causing Elissa to name Andy the replacement nominee. On Day 70, Aaryn was evicted by a vote of 5\u20130.<ref name=\"week_9_THR\">{{cite magazine|title = 'Big Brother 15': Latest Houseguest Evicted, Audience Gets Vocal|date = August 29, 2013|url = http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/big-brother-15-ninth-houseguest-617564|last = Ng|first = Philiana|magazine = The Hollywood Reporter}}</ref>\n\nFollowing Aaryn's eviction, the remaining HouseGuests began the \"Big Hopportunity\" competition. The HouseGuests were to hop to a wall made from chicken wire. There, each HouseGuest navigated their egg them through a maze formed by the letters \"HoH\" to a hole at the far side. They then had to hop back down and drop the egg in their basket. GinaMarie was the first HouseGuest with a dozen eggs and won the HoH. On the live show, Julie Chen also announced that the HouseGuests will compete in a special competition, and a live double eviction during Week 10.<ref name=\"week_9_THR\" /> On Day 71, GinaMarie chose to nominate Amanda and McCrae for eviction. On Day 72, Spencer, Andy, and Elissa were selected to play in the Veto competition. McCrae won the Veto competition. On Day 74, McCrae used the Veto on himself and Spencer was once again named the replacement nominee. On Day 77, Amanda was evicted in a 3\u20132 vote after GinaMarie was forced to break the tie.  Because this was also a double eviction week, the remaining HouseGuests went straight into the Head of Household competition, which McCrae won. McCrae (unaware that Andy was the one who had double crossed him and Amanda) nominated Elissa and GinaMarie shortly after. When Judd won the Power of Veto, he decided not to use it and Elissa was evicted in a unanimous 3\u20130 vote.\n\nFollowing Amanda and Elissa's eviction, the HouseGuests competed in the following Head of Household competition, which Spencer won. He nominated GinaMarie and McCrae. On Day 79, McCrae won the Power of Veto, his third Veto win of the season. On Day 81, McCrae used the Veto on himself and Spencer chose to name Judd as the replacement nominee. On Day 82, Judd was evicted from the house for a second time in a 2\u20130 vote.\n\nFollowing Judd's second eviction, Andy won his second HoH of the season in the \"Before or After\" HoH competition. On Day 83, he nominated McCrae and Spencer for eviction. That same day, the HouseGuests competed in the final Veto competition of the season, titled \"Web of (F)Lies.\" Andy won the Power of Veto. On Day 84, Andy decided not to use the Power of Veto. Immediately following the Veto ceremony, GinaMarie, with the sole vote to evict, choose to evict McCrae from the game.\n\nFollowing McCrae's eviction, the final three participated in the first part of the final HoH competition, \"The Great E-skate,\" with GinaMarie being the victor. On Day 86, Spencer and Andy competed in part two of the final HoH competition, \"Crab Grab,\" which Andy won. During the finale, Andy and GinaMarie faced off in the final part of the competition, \"Jury Statements\". Andy won the competition and, as final HoH, cast the sole vote to evict Spencer from the house. After asking questions to the final two, the nine-person jury voted to crown the season's winner. Andy won in with a 7\u20132 vote, and Elissa won $25,000 as America's Favorite HouseGuest, with Judd and Howard gaining the next-highest number of votes.<ref name=\"THR_finale\" />\n\n==Episodes==\n<!--The episode table below needs to contain the season summary in the section above above.

This HouseGuest is named the Most Valuable Player, or M.V.P., and has the power to nominate one HouseGuest for eviction. This nomination is made privately and the HouseGuest is not obligated to reveal their identity. If the veto is used to save the M.V.P.-nominated HouseGuest, the M.V.P. also privately nominates the replacement. Their nominations are shown in '''bold'''.\n*{{note|2|Note 2}}: {{Color box|#C2D5E8|border=darkgray}} For weeks four through six, unbeknownst to the other HouseGuests, America was given the M.V.P. power. The HouseGuest with the most viewer votes, other than the HoH and their two nominees, became the third nominee.  If the Veto is used to take the original M.V.P. nominee off the block, then the next eligible HouseGuest with the highest number of viewer votes will be nominated in their place. The nominations are shown in '''bold'''.\n*{{note|3|Note 3}}: This week was a double eviction week. Following the first eviction, the remaining HouseGuests played a week's worth of games\u2014including HoH and Veto competitions and Nomination, Veto and Eviction ceremonies\u2014during the remainder of the live show, culminating in a second eviction for the week.\n*{{note|4|Note 4}}: After the first Week 6 eviction, the M.V.P. power was removed from the game.

The winner of the Power of Veto can remove one of the nominees from the block, forcing the HoH to nominate another HouseGuest.

For this competition, HouseGuests were put into a tournament-style bracket. The object was to roll a ball down a curved banana and have it land on top of the ice cream sundae. The first HouseGuest to get the ball on the sundae, moved on to the next round. Andy was the winner. Andy was also tasked with picking four HouseGuests as Have-Nots for the week and chose Aaryn, Elissa, GinaMarie, and Helen. On Day 50, Jessie and Spencer were nominated for eviction. Elissa, Amanda, and Helen were picked to play in the veto competition, while McCrae was selected to host. That same day, HouseGuests competed in the \"BBB Movie\" Power of Veto competition. For this competition, HouseGuests were given a few minutes to study three movie sets. They were then asked questions about how many of a certain item there were in a set. If the HouseGuest was confident in their answer, they would \"stay\" for an attempt at winning a movie ticket. The housemate that was closest to the correct answer would receive a movie ticket, while the others were eliminated. If they were not confident they would \"fold\" and stay in the competition regardless of their answer. The first HouseGuest to obtain three movie tickets would be the winner. Andy was the winner. On Day 53, Andy chose not to use the Power of Veto. On Day 56, in a unanimous vote of 6-0, Jessie was evicted and became the third jury member.\n\nFollowing Jessie's eviction, Aaryn won her fourth Head of Household of the season in the \"Way Off Broadway\" HoH competition. Later that day, Julie Chen revealed to the audience that one of the four jury members would be coming back on the next weeks eviction night. On Day 57, the HouseGuests competed in the Have-Not competition, \"The Black Box\". In this competition, the HouseGuests had to enter a big, pitch-black box with many crawl spaces and gags, find the key, and exit the black box and hit a button to stop the timer. Amanda, Elissa, GinaMarie, and Helen were the Have-Nots for the week. Aaryn then chose to nominate Elissa and Helen, with Helen being her target. Andy, GinaMarie, and Spencer were selected to play in the Veto competition. On Day 58, Elissa went on to win her second Veto competition of the season. Elissa used the Veto to remove her nomination, and Aaryn nominated Spencer in her stead. On Day 63, Helen was evicted by a vote of 4-1, with Elissa being the only one to vote for Spencer.\n\nShortly after Helen's eviction, the remaining HouseGuests and first four jurors competed in the \"Off the Wall\" competition, which functioned as both the HoH and re-entry competition. The HouseGuests and jurors were to stand on platforms and catch balls thrown at them without falling off. The first player overall to catch 10 balls or last to remain standing would be the new HoH, and the first juror to do so would return to the game. Judd was the last juror left standing and returned to the game as a HouseGuest, and Elissa was the first to catch 10 balls and became Head of Household. On Day 64, Elissa nominated Aaryn and McCrae for eviction. On Day 65, Amanda, GinaMarie, and Judd were selected to play in the Veto competition. Amanda won the Veto competition, her first individual competition win of the season. On Day 67, Amanda used the Power of Veto to save McCrae, causing Elissa to name Andy the replacement nominee. On Day 70, Aaryn was evicted by a vote of 5-0.<ref name=\"week_9_THR\">{{cite magazine|title = 'Big Brother 15': Latest Houseguest Evicted, Audience Gets Vocal|date = August 29, 2013|url = http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/big-brother-15-ninth-houseguest-617564|last = Ng|first = Philiana|magazine = The Hollywood Reporter}}</ref>\n\nFollowing Aaryn's eviction, the remaining HouseGuests began the \"Big Hopportunity\" competition. The HouseGuests were to hop to a wall made from chicken wire. There, each HouseGuest navigated their egg them through a maze formed by the letters \"HoH\" to a hole at the far side. They then had to hop back down and drop the egg in their basket. GinaMarie was the first HouseGuest with a dozen eggs and won the HoH. On the live show, Julie Chen also announced that the HouseGuests will compete in a special competition, and a live double eviction during Week 10.<ref name=\"week_9_THR\" /> On Day 71, GinaMarie chose to nominate Amanda and McCrae for eviction. On Day 72, Spencer, Andy, and Elissa were selected to play in the Veto competition. McCrae won the Veto competition. On Day 74, McCrae used the Veto on himself and Spencer was once again named the replacement nominee. On Day 77, Amanda was evicted in a 3-2 vote after GinaMarie was forced to break the tie.  Because this was also a double eviction week, the remaining HouseGuests went straight into the Head of Household competition, which McCrae won. McCrae (unaware that Andy was the one who had double crossed him and Amanda) nominated Elissa and GinaMarie shortly after. When Judd won the Power of Veto, he decided not to use it and Elissa was evicted in a unanimous 3-0 vote.\n\nFollowing Amanda and Elissa's eviction, the HouseGuests competed in the following Head of Household competition, which Spencer won. He nominated GinaMarie and McCrae. On Day 79, McCrae won the Power of Veto, his third Veto win of the season. On Day 81, McCrae used the Veto on himself and Spencer chose to name Judd as the replacement nominee. On Day 82, Judd was evicted from the house for a second time in a 2-0 vote.\n\nFollowing Judd's second eviction, Andy won his second HoH of the season in the \"Before or After\" HoH competition. On Day 83, he nominated McCrae and Spencer for eviction. That same day, the HouseGuests competed in the final Veto competition of the season, titled \"Web of (F)Lies.\" Andy won the Power of Veto. On Day 84, Andy decided not to use the Power of Veto. Immediately following the Veto ceremony, GinaMarie, with the sole vote to evict, choose to evict McCrae from the game.\n\nFollowing McCrae's eviction, the final three participated in the first part of the final HoH competition, \"The Great E-skate,\" with GinaMarie being the victor. On Day 86, Spencer and Andy competed in part two of the final HoH competition, \"Crab Grab,\" which Andy won. During the finale, Andy and GinaMarie faced off in the final part of the competition, \"Jury Statements\". Andy won the competition and, as final HoH, cast the sole vote to evict Spencer from the house. After asking questions to the final two, the nine-person jury voted to crown the season's winner. Andy won in with a 7-2 vote, and Elissa won $25,000 as America's Favorite HouseGuest, with Judd and Howard gaining the next-highest number of votes.<ref name=\"THR_finale\" />\n\n==Episodes==\n<!--The episode table below needs to contain the season summary in the section above above.

This HouseGuest is named the Most Valuable Player, or M.V.P., and has the power to nominate one HouseGuest for eviction. This nomination is made privately and the HouseGuest is not obligated to reveal their identity. If the veto is used to save the M.V.P.-nominated HouseGuest, the M.V.P. also privately nominates the replacement. Their nominations are shown in '''bold'''.\n*{{note|2|Note 2}}: {{Color box|#C2D5E8|border=darkgray}} For weeks four through six, unbeknownst to the other HouseGuests, America was given the M.V.P. power. The HouseGuest with the most viewer votes, other than the HoH and their two nominees, became the third nominee.  If the Veto is used to take the original M.V.P. nominee off the block, then the next eligible HouseGuest with the highest number of viewer votes will be nominated in their place. The nominations are shown in '''bold'''.\n*{{note|3|Note 3}}: This week was a double eviction week. Following the first eviction, the remaining HouseGuests played a week's worth of games\u2014including HoH and Veto competitions and Nomination, Veto and Eviction ceremonies\u2014during the remainder of the live show, culminating in a second eviction for the week.\n*{{note|4|Note 4}}: After the first Week 6 eviction, the M.V.P. power was removed from the game.

Diffusion is driven by a gradient in concentration.\n\nThe concept of diffusion is widely used in many fields, including [[physics]] ([[Molecular diffusion|particle diffusion]]), [[chemistry]], [[biology]], [[sociology]], [[economics]], and [[finance]] (diffusion of people, ideas, and price values). The central idea of diffusion, however, is common to all of these: an object (for example, atom, idea, etc.) undergoing diffusion spreads out from a point or location at which there is a higher concentration of that object.\n\nA [[gradient]] is the change in the value of a quantity, for example, concentration, [[pressure]], or [[temperature]] with the change in another variable, usually [[distance]]. A change in concentration over a distance is called a [[Molecular diffusion|concentration gradient]], a change in pressure over a distance is called a [[pressure gradient]], and a change in temperature over a distance is called a [[temperature gradient]].\n\nThe word '''diffusion''' derives from the [[Latin]] word, ''diffundere'', which means \"to spread  out.\"\n\nA distinguishing feature of diffusion is that it depends on particle [[random walk]], and results in mixing or mass transport without requiring directed bulk motion. Bulk motion, or bulk flow, is the characteristic of [[advection]].<ref>[[John Gamble Kirkwood|J.G. Kirkwood]], R.L. Baldwin, P.J. Dunlop, L.J. Gosting, G. Kegeles (1960)[http://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.1731433 Flow equations and frames of reference for isothermal diffusion in liquids]. The Journal of Chemical Physics 33(5):1505\u201313.</ref>\nThe term [[convection]] is used to describe the combination of both [[transport phenomena]].\n\nIf a diffusion process can be described by [[Fick's laws of diffusion|Fick's laws]], it's called a normal diffusion (or Fickian diffusion); Otherwise, it's called an [[anomalous diffusion]] (or non-Fickian diffusion).\n\nWhen talking about the extent of diffusion, two length scales are used in two different scenarios:\n\n# [[Brownian motion]] of an [[Impulse response|impulsive]] point source (for example, one single spray of perfume)\u2014the square root of the [[mean squared displacement]] from this point. In Fickian diffusion, this is <math>\\sqrt{2nDt}</math>, where <math>n</math> is the [[dimension]] of this Brownian motion;\n# [[Fick's laws of diffusion#Example solutions and generalization|Constant concentration source]] in 1-Dimension\u2014the diffusion length. In Fickian diffusion, this is <math>2\\sqrt{Dt}</math>.\n\n==Diffusion vs. bulk flow==\n\"Bulk flow\" is the movement/flow of an entire body due to a pressure gradient (for example, water coming out of a tap). \"Diffusion\" is the gradual movement/dispersion of concentration within a body, due to a concentration gradient, with no net movement of matter. An example of a process where both [[Mass flow|bulk motion]] and diffusion occur is human breathing.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Muir|first=D. C. F.|date=1966-10-01|title=Bulk flow and diffusion in the airways of the lung|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000709716680044X|journal=British Journal of Diseases of the Chest|language=en|volume=60|issue=4|pages=169\u2013176|doi=10.1016/S0007-0971(66)80044-X|issn=0007-0971}}</ref>\n\nFirst there is a \"bulk flow\" process. The [[lungs]] are located in the [[thoracic cavity]], which expands as the first step in external respiration. This expansion leads to an increase in volume of the [[Pulmonary alveolus|alveoli]] in the lungs, which causes a decrease in pressure in the alveoli. This creates a pressure gradient between the [[air]] outside the body at relatively high pressure and the alveoli at relatively low pressure. The air moves down the pressure gradient through the airways of the lungs and into the alveoli until the pressure of the air and that in the alveoli are equal, that is, the movement of air by bulk flow stops once there is no longer a pressure gradient.\n\nSecondly there a \"diffusion\" process. The air arriving in the alveoli has a higher concentration of oxygen than the \"stale\" air in the alveoli. The increase in oxygen concentration creates a concentration gradient for oxygen between the air in the alveoli and the blood in the [[capillaries]] that surround the alveoli. Oxygen then moves by diffusion, down the concentration gradient, into the blood. The other consequence of the air arriving in alveoli is that the concentration of [[carbon dioxide]] in the alveoli decreases. This creates a concentration gradient for carbon dioxide to diffuse from the blood into the alveoli, as fresh air has a very low concentration of carbon dioxide compared to the [[blood]] in the body.\n\nThirdly there is another \"bulk flow\" process. The pumping action of the [[heart]] then transports the blood around the body. As the left ventricle of the heart contracts, the volume decreases, which increases the pressure in the ventricle. This creates a pressure gradient between the heart and the capillaries, and blood moves through [[blood vessel]]s by bulk flow down the pressure gradient.\n\n==Diffusion in the context of different disciplines==\n[[File:Centrotherm diffusion furnaces at LAAS 0481.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Diffusion furnaces used for [[thermal oxidation]]]]\nThe concept of diffusion is widely used in: [[physics]] ([[Molecular diffusion|particle diffusion]]), [[chemistry]], [[biology]], [[sociology]], [[economics]], and [[finance]] (diffusion of people, ideas and of price values). However, in each case the object (for example, atom, idea) undergoing diffusion is \"spreading out\" from a point or location at which there is a higher concentration of that object.\n\nThere are two ways to introduce the notion of ''diffusion'': either a [[wikt:phenomenon|phenomenological approach]] starting with [[Fick's laws of diffusion]] and their mathematical consequences, or a physical and atomistic one, by considering the ''[[random walk]] of the diffusing particles''.<ref>J. Philibert (2005). [http://ul.qucosa.de/fileadmin/data/qucosa/documents/19504/diff_fund_2%282005%291.pdf One and a half century of diffusion: Fick, Einstein, before and beyond.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213113203/http://www.rz.uni-leipzig.de/diffusion/pdf/volume2/diff_fund_2(2005)1.pdf |date=2013-12-13 }} Diffusion Fundamentals, 2, 1.1\u20131.10.</ref>\n\nIn the phenomenological approach, ''diffusion is the movement of a substance from a region of high concentration to a region of low concentration without bulk motion''. According to Fick's laws, the diffusion [[Flux#Flux as flow rate per unit area|flux]] is proportional to the negative [[gradient]] of concentrations. It goes from regions of higher concentration to regions of lower concentration. Sometime later, various generalizations of Fick's laws were developed in the frame of [[thermodynamics]] and [[non-equilibrium thermodynamics]].<ref>S.R. De Groot, P. Mazur (1962).

In [[molecular diffusion]], the moving molecules are self-propelled by thermal energy. Random walk of small particles in suspension in a fluid was discovered in 1827 by [[Robert Brown (botanist, born 1773)|Robert Brown]],he found that minute particle suspended in a liquid medium and just large enough to be visible under an optical microscope exhibit a rapid and continually irregular motion of particles known as Brownian movement. The theory of the [[Brownian motion]] and the atomistic backgrounds of diffusion were developed by [[Albert Einstein]].<ref>{{cite journal|author=A.

For example, oxygen can diffuse through cell membranes so long as there is a higher concentration of oxygen outside the cell. However, because the movement of molecules is random, occasionally oxygen molecules move out of the cell (against the concentration gradient). Because there are more oxygen molecules outside the cell, the [[probability]] that oxygen molecules will enter the cell is higher than the probability that oxygen molecules will leave the cell. Therefore, the \"net\" movement of oxygen molecules (the difference between the number of molecules either entering or leaving the cell) is into the cell. In other words, there is a ''net movement'' of oxygen molecules down the concentration gradient.\n\n==History of diffusion in physics==\nIn the scope of time, diffusion in solids was used long before the theory of diffusion was created. For example, [[Pliny the Elder]] had previously described the [[cementation process]], which produces steel from the element iron (Fe) through carbon diffusion. Another example is well known for many centuries, the diffusion of colors of [[stained glass]] or [[earthenware]] and [[Chinese ceramics]].\n\nIn modern science, the first systematic experimental study of diffusion was performed by [[Thomas Graham (chemist)|Thomas Graham]]. He studied diffusion in gases, and the main phenomenon was described by him in 1831\u20131833:<ref>''Diffusion Processes'', Thomas Graham Symposium, ed. J.N. Sherwood, A.V. Chadwick, W.M.Muir, F.L. Swinton, Gordon and Breach, London, 1971.</ref>\n\n<blockquote>\"...gases of different nature, when brought into contact, do not arrange themselves according to their density, the heaviest undermost, and the lighter uppermost, but they spontaneously diffuse, mutually and equally, through each other, and so remain in the intimate state of mixture for any length of time.\" </blockquote>\n\nThe measurements of Graham contributed to [[James Clerk Maxwell]] deriving, in 1867, the coefficient of diffusion for CO<sub>2</sub> in the air. The error rate is less than 5%.\n\nIn 1855, [[Adolf Fick]], the 26-year-old anatomy demonstrator from Z\u00fcrich, proposed [[Fick's laws of diffusion|his law of diffusion]]. He used Graham's research, stating his goal as \"the development of a fundamental law, for the operation of diffusion in a single element of space\". He asserted a deep analogy between diffusion and conduction of heat or electricity, creating a formalism similar to [[Thermal conduction|Fourier's law for heat conduction]] (1822) and [[Ohm's law]] for electric current (1827).\n\n[[Robert Boyle]] demonstrated diffusion in solids in the 17th century<ref>L.W. Barr (1997), In: ''Diffusion in Materials, DIMAT 96'', ed. H.Mehrer, Chr. Herzig, N.A. Stolwijk, H. Bracht, Scitec Publications, Vol.1, pp. 1\u20139.</ref> by penetration of zinc into a copper coin. Nevertheless, diffusion in solids was not systematically studied until the second part of the 19th century.

In the same year, [[James Clerk Maxwell]] developed the first atomistic theory of transport processes in gases. The modern atomistic theory of diffusion and [[Brownian motion]] was developed by [[Albert Einstein]], [[Marian Smoluchowski]] and [[Jean-Baptiste Perrin]]. [[Ludwig Boltzmann]], in the development of the atomistic backgrounds of the macroscopic [[transport phenomena|transport processes]], introduced the [[Boltzmann equation]], which has served mathematics and physics with a source of transport process ideas and concerns for more than 140 years.<ref name=\"ChapmanCowling\">S.

He concluded, the diffusion process in condensed matter is an ensemble of elementary jumps and quasichemical interactions of particles and defects. He introduced several mechanisms of diffusion and found rate constants from experimental data.\n\nSometime later, [[Carl Wagner]] and [[Walter H.

A [[molecule]] or [[ion]] with [[kinetic energy]] (explain) collides with other molecules and ions, and each collision alters the kinetic energy and [[momentum]] of both particles. Unless the particles are bound in position in a solid, they are free to move away from each other until the next collision. Therefore, in a fluid all the particles move from collision to collision, changing direction with each collision. The path of any given particle is random, so the probability of it returning to a previous position is lower than of going somewhere else since there are so many more other places to go. If the fluid is in a container, any collision with the solid container sends it back into the volume of the fluid. The rate at which a given particle moves away from its original position depends on how fast it moves on average, which depends on the temperature, and how often it collides with other particles, which in turn depends on how far apart they are on average. The particles of a gas are much further apart than the particles of a liquid, so a gas molecule or ion generally goes further before colliding and changing direction each time, so it moves away from any given point more quickly, assuming equal velocities.\n\nWhen all particles start out evenly mixed, there is no noticeable difference over time, and they stay evenly mixed. However, if there is a region where most of the particles are of one type at a given time, they tend to disperse until evenly distributed.\n-->\n\n== Basic models of diffusion ==\n\n=== Diffusion flux ===\nEach model of diffusion expresses the '''diffusion flux''' through concentrations, densities and their derivatives. Flux is a vector <math>\\mathbf{J}</math> representing the quantity and direction of transfer. The transfer of a [[physical quantity]] <math>N</math> through a small [[area]] <math>\\Delta S</math> with normal <math>\\nu</math> per time <math>\\Delta t</math> is\n:<math>\\Delta N = (\\mathbf{J},\\nu) \\,\\Delta S \\,\\Delta t +o(\\Delta S \\,\\Delta t)\\, ,</math>\nwhere <math>(\\mathbf{J},\\nu)</math> is the [[inner product]] and <math>o(\\cdots)</math> is the [[little-o notation]].\nIf we use the notation of [[vector area]] <math>\\Delta \\mathbf{S}=\\nu \\, \\Delta S</math> then\n:<math>\\Delta N = (\\mathbf{J}, \\Delta \\mathbf{S}) \\, \\Delta t +o(\\Delta \\mathbf{S} \\,\\Delta t)\\, . </math>\nThe [[Dimensional analysis|dimension]] of the diffusion flux is [flux]&nbsp;=&nbsp;[quantity]/([time]\u00b7[area]).\nThe diffusing physical quantity <math>N</math> may be the number of particles, mass, energy, electric charge, or any other scalar [[extensive quantity]]. For its density, <math>n</math>, the diffusion equation has the form\n:<math>\\frac{\\partial n}{\\partial t}= - \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{J} +W \\, ,</math>\nwhere <math>W</math> is intensity of any local source of this quantity (for example, the rate of a chemical reaction).\nFor the diffusion equation, the '''no-flux boundary conditions''' can be formulated as <math>(\\mathbf{J}(x),\\nu(x))=0</math> on the boundary, where <math>\\nu</math> is the normal to the boundary at point <math>x</math>.\n\n=== Fick's law and equations ===\n{{Main|Fick's laws of diffusion}}\n\nFick's first law: the diffusion flux is proportional to the negative of the concentration gradient:\n:<math>\\mathbf{J}=-D \\,\\nabla n \\ , \\;\\; J_i=-D \\frac{\\partial n}{\\partial x_i} \\ .</math>\nThe corresponding diffusion equation (Fick's second law) is\n:<math>\\frac{\\partial n(x,t)}{\\partial t}=\\nabla\\cdot( D \\,\\nabla n(x,t))=D \\, \\Delta n(x,t)\\ , </math>\nwhere <math>\\Delta</math> is the [[Laplace operator]],\n:<math>\\Delta n(x,t) = \\sum_i \\frac{\\partial^2 n(x,t)}{\\partial x_i^2} \\ .</math>\n\n=== Onsager's equations for multicomponent diffusion and thermodiffusion ===\nFick's law describes diffusion of an admixture in a medium. The concentration of this admixture should be small and the gradient of this concentration should be also small. The driving force of diffusion in Fick's law is the antigradient of concentration, <math>-\\nabla n</math>.\n\nIn 1931, [[Lars Onsager]]<ref name = \"Onsager1931\">{{cite journal|author=Onsager, L. |year=1931|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.37.405|title=Reciprocal Relations in Irreversible Processes.

For\nmulti-component transport,\n:<math>\\mathbf{J}_i=\\sum_j L_{ij} X_j \\, ,</math>\nwhere <math>\\mathbf{J}_i</math> is the flux of the ''i''th physical quantity (component) and <math>X_j</math> is the ''j''th [[Conjugate variables (thermodynamics)|thermodynamic force]].\n\nThe thermodynamic forces for the transport processes were introduced by Onsager as the space gradients of the derivatives of the [[entropy]] density ''s'' (he used the term \"force\" in quotation marks or \"driving force\"):\n:<math>X_i= \\operatorname{grad} \\frac {\\partial s(n)}{\\partial n_i}\\ ,</math>\nwhere <math>n_i</math> are the \"thermodynamic coordinates\".\nFor the heat and mass transfer one can take <math>n_0=u</math> (the density of internal energy) and <math>n_i</math> is the concentration of the ''i''th component. The corresponding driving forces are the space vectors\n: <math>X_0= \\operatorname{grad} \\frac{1}{T}\\ , \\;\\;\\; X_i= - \\operatorname{grad} \\frac{\\mu_i}{T} \\; (i >0) ,</math> because <math>\\mathrm{d}s = \\frac{1}{T} \\,\\mathrm{d}u-\\sum_{i \\geq 1} \\frac{\\mu_i}{T} \\, {\\rm d} n_i</math>\nwhere ''T'' is the absolute temperature and <math>\\mu_i</math> is the chemical potential of the ''i''th component. It should be stressed that the separate diffusion equations describe the mixing or mass transport without bulk motion. Therefore, the terms with variation of the total pressure are neglected. It is possible for diffusion of small admixtures and for small gradients.\n\nFor the linear Onsager equations, we must take the thermodynamic forces in the linear approximation near equilibrium:\n:<math>X_i= \\sum_{k \\geq 0} \\left.\\frac{\\partial^2 s(n)}{\\partial n_i \\, \\partial n_k}\\right|_{n=n^*} \\operatorname{grad} n_k \\ ,</math>\nwhere the derivatives of ''s'' are calculated at equilibrium ''n''<sup>*</sup>.\nThe matrix of the ''kinetic coefficients'' <math>L_{ij}</math> should be symmetric ([[Onsager reciprocal relations]]) and [[Positive-definite matrix|positive definite]] ([[Second law of thermodynamics|for the entropy growth]]).\n\nThe transport equations are\n:<math>\\frac{\\partial n_i}{\\partial t}= - \\operatorname{div} \\mathbf{J}_i =- \\sum_{j\\geq 0} L_{ij}\\operatorname{div} X_j = \\sum_{k\\geq 0} \\left[-\\sum_{j\\geq 0} L_{ij} \\left.\\frac{\\partial^2 s(n)}{\\partial n_j \\, \\partial n_k}\\right|_{n=n^*}\\right] \\, \\Delta n_k\\ .</math>\nHere, all the indexes ''i, j, k''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0,&nbsp;1,&nbsp;2,&nbsp;... are related to the internal energy (0) and various components. The expression in the square brackets is the matrix <math>D_{ik}</math>of the diffusion (''i,k''&nbsp;>&nbsp;0), thermodiffusion (''i''&nbsp;>&nbsp;0, ''k''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 or ''k''&nbsp;>&nbsp;0, ''i''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0) and [[thermal conductivity]] (''i''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''k''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0) coefficients.\n\nUnder [[Isothermal process|isothermal conditions]] ''T''&nbsp;=&nbsp;constant. The relevant thermodynamic potential is the free energy (or the [[free entropy]]). The thermodynamic driving forces for the isothermal diffusion are antigradients of chemical potentials, <math>-(1/T)\\,\\nabla\\mu_j</math>, and the matrix of diffusion coefficients is\n:<math>D_{ik}=\\frac{1}{T}\\sum_{j\\geq 1} L_{ij} \\left.\\frac{\\partial \\mu_j(n,T)} { \\partial n_k}\\right|_{n=n^*}</math>\n(''i,k''&nbsp;>&nbsp;0).\n\nThere is intrinsic arbitrariness in the definition of the thermodynamic forces and kinetic coefficients because they are not measurable separately and only their combinations <math>\\sum_j L_{ij}X_j</math> can be measured. For example, in the original work of Onsager<ref name = \"Onsager1931\"/> the thermodynamic forces include additional multiplier ''T'', whereas in the [[Course of Theoretical Physics]]<ref>\n{{cite book\n |author=[[Lev Landau|L.D.

All these changes are supplemented by the corresponding changes in the coefficients and do not affect the measurable quantities.\n\n=== Nondiagonal diffusion must be nonlinear ===\nThe formalism of linear irreversible thermodynamics (Onsager) generates the systems of linear diffusion equations in the form\n:<math>\\frac{\\partial c_i}{\\partial t} = \\sum_j D_{ij} \\, \\Delta c_j.</math>\nIf the matrix of diffusion coefficients is diagonal, then this system of equations is just a collection of decoupled Fick's equations for various components. Assume that diffusion is non-diagonal, for example, <math>D_{12} \\neq 0</math>, and consider the state with <math>c_2 = \\cdots = c_n = 0</math>. At this state, <math>\\partial c_2 / \\partial t = D_{12} \\, \\Delta c_1</math>. If <math>D_{12} \\, \\Delta c_1(x) < 0</math> at some points, then <math>c_2(x)</math> becomes negative at these points in a short time. Therefore, linear non-diagonal diffusion does not preserve positivity of concentrations. Non-diagonal equations of multicomponent diffusion must be non-linear.<ref name=GorbanMMNP2011/>\n\n=== Einstein's mobility and Teorell formula ===\nThe [[Einstein relation (kinetic theory)]] connects the diffusion coefficient and the mobility (the ratio of the particle's terminal [[drift velocity]] to an applied [[force]])<ref>S.

He formulated the essence of his approach in the formula:\n:'''the flux is equal to mobility \u00d7 concentration \u00d7 force per gram-ion'''.\nThis is the so-called ''Teorell formula''. The term \"gram-ion\" (\"gram-particle\")  is used for a quantity of a substance that contains [[Avogadro constant|Avogadro's number]] of ions (particles). The common modern term is [[Mole (unit)|mole]].\n\nThe force under isothermal conditions consists of two parts:\n# Diffusion force caused by concentration gradient: <math>-RT \\frac{1}{n} \\, \\nabla n = -RT \\, \\nabla (\\ln(n/n^\\text{eq}))</math>.\n# Electrostatic force caused by electric potential gradient: <math>q \\, \\nabla \\varphi</math>.\nHere ''R'' is the gas constant, ''T'' is the absolute temperature, ''n'' is the concentration, the equilibrium concentration is marked by a superscript \"eq\", ''q'' is the charge and ''\u03c6'' is the electric potential.\n\nThe simple but crucial difference between the Teorell formula and the Onsager laws is the concentration factor in the Teorell expression for the flux. In the Einstein\u2013Teorell approach, If for the finite force the concentration tends to zero then the flux also tends to zero, whereas the Onsager equations violate this simple and physically obvious rule.\n\nThe general formulation of the Teorell formula for non-perfect systems under isothermal conditions is<ref name=GorbanMMNP2011/>\n:<math>\\mathbf{J} = \\mathfrak{m} \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\mu - \\mu_0}{RT}\\right)(-\\nabla \\mu + (\\text{external force per mole})),</math>\nwhere ''\u03bc'' is the [[chemical potential]], ''\u03bc''<sub>0</sub> is the standard value of the chemical potential.\nThe expression <math>a = \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\mu - \\mu_0}{RT}\\right)</math> is the so-called [[Activity (chemistry)|activity]].

So, there exist a combination of diffusion mechanisms in poroous media. To understand this, lets consider the example of ceramic membranes. when a gas enters into a ceramic membrane it undergoes the molecular diffusion when moving through the material of the porous media and knudsen diffusion ( if the diameter of pore is less than the length of the pore) and molecular difussion ( can be self diffusion or mutual diffusion depending on the number of species being diffused) in series when moving in the pores. while moving in the pore the poiseuille diffusion also happens in parrllel with knudsen and molecular diffusion. Depending on the nature of material and operating conditions one or more types of diffusion may not be aplicable be small and can be neglected but basic phenomenon is the same. for more information see <M.

Dependence on a total concentration ''n'' for a given temperature has always the same character, 1/''n''.\n\nIn applications to gas dynamics, the diffusion flux and the bulk flow should be joined in one system of transport equations. The bulk flow describes the mass transfer. Its velocity ''V'' is the mass average velocity. It is defined through the momentum density and the mass concentrations:\n:<math>V=\\frac{\\sum_i \\rho_i C_i} \\rho \\, .</math>\nwhere <math>\\rho_i =m_i n_i</math> is the mass concentration of the ''i''th species, <math>\\rho=\\sum_i \\rho_i</math> is the mass density.\n\nBy definition, the diffusion velocity of the ''i''th component is <math>v_i=C_i-V</math>, <math>\\sum_i \\rho_i v_i=0</math>.\nThe mass transfer of the ''i''th component is described by the [[continuity equation]]\n:<math>\\frac{\\partial \\rho_i}{\\partial t}+\\nabla(\\rho_i V) + \\nabla (\\rho_i v_i) = W_i \\, ,</math>\nwhere <math>W_i</math> is the net mass production rate in chemical reactions, <math>\\sum_i W_i= 0</math>.\n\nIn these equations, the term <math>\\nabla(\\rho_i V)</math> describes advection of the ''i''th component and the term <math>\\nabla (\\rho_i v_i)</math> represents diffusion of this component.\n\nIn 1948, [[Wendell H.

For example, when a bias is applied to two ends of a chunk of semiconductor, or a light shines on one end (see right figure), electron diffuse from high density regions (center) to low density regions (two ends), forming a gradient of electron density.

Substances appear to move randomly due to collisions with other substances. From the iBook ''Cell Membrane Transport'', free license granted by IS3D, LLC, 2014.]] One common misconception is that individual atoms, ions or molecules move randomly, which they do not. In the animation on the right, the ion on in the left panel has a \"random\" motion, but this motion is not random as it is the result of \"collisions\" with other ions. As such, the movement of a single atom, ion, or molecule within a mixture just appears random when viewed in isolation. The movement of a substance within a mixture by \"random walk\" is governed by the kinetic energy within the system that can be affected by changes in concentration, pressure or temperature.\n\n=== Separation of diffusion from convection in gases ===\nWhile Brownian motion of multi-molecular mesoscopic particles (like pollen grains studied by Brown) is observable under an optical microscope, molecular diffusion can only be probed in carefully controlled experimental conditions. Since Graham experiments, it is well known that avoiding of convection is necessary and this may be a non-trivial task.\n\nUnder normal conditions, molecular diffusion dominates only on length scales between nanometer and millimeter. On larger length scales, transport in liquids and gases is normally due to another [[transport phenomena|transport phenomenon]], [[convection]], and to study diffusion on the larger scale, special efforts are needed.\n\nTherefore, some often cited examples of diffusion are ''wrong'': If cologne is sprayed in one place, it can soon be smelled in the entire room, but a simple calculation shows that this can't be due to diffusion. Convective motion persists in the room because of the temperature [inhomogeneity]. If ink is dropped in water, one usually observes an inhomogeneous evolution of the spatial distribution, which clearly indicates convection (caused, in particular, by this dropping).{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}\n\nIn contrast, [[heat conduction]] through solid media is an everyday occurrence (for example, a metal spoon partly immersed in a hot liquid).

Diffusion is driven by a gradient in concentration.\n\nThe concept of diffusion is widely used in many fields, including [[physics]] ([[Molecular diffusion|particle diffusion]]), [[chemistry]], [[biology]], [[sociology]], [[economics]], and [[finance]] (diffusion of people, ideas, and price values). The central idea of diffusion, however, is common to all of these: an object (for example, atom, idea, etc.) undergoing diffusion spreads out from a point or location at which there is a higher concentration of that object.\n\nA [[gradient]] is the change in the value of a quantity, for example, concentration, [[pressure]], or [[temperature]] with the change in another variable, usually [[distance]]. A change in concentration over a distance is called a [[Molecular diffusion|concentration gradient]], a change in pressure over a distance is called a [[pressure gradient]], and a change in temperature over a distance is called a [[temperature gradient]].\n\nThe word '''diffusion''' derives from the [[Latin]] word, ''diffundere'', which means \"to spread  out.\"\n\nA distinguishing feature of diffusion is that it depends on particle [[random walk]], and results in mixing or mass transport without requiring directed bulk motion. Bulk motion, or bulk flow, is the characteristic of [[advection]].<ref>[[John Gamble Kirkwood|J.G. Kirkwood]], R.L. Baldwin, P.J. Dunlop, L.J. Gosting, G.

An example of a process where both [[Mass flow|bulk motion]] and diffusion occur is human breathing.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Muir|first=D. C.

The [[lungs]] are located in the [[thoracic cavity]], which expands as the first step in external respiration. This expansion leads to an increase in volume of the [[Pulmonary alveolus|alveoli]] in the lungs, which causes a decrease in pressure in the alveoli. This creates a pressure gradient between the [[air]] outside the body at relatively high pressure and the alveoli at relatively low pressure. The air moves down the pressure gradient through the airways of the lungs and into the alveoli until the pressure of the air and that in the alveoli are equal, that is, the movement of air by bulk flow stops once there is no longer a pressure gradient.\n\nSecondly there a \"diffusion\" process. The air arriving in the alveoli has a higher concentration of oxygen than the \"stale\" air in the alveoli. The increase in oxygen concentration creates a concentration gradient for oxygen between the air in the alveoli and the blood in the [[capillaries]] that surround the alveoli. Oxygen then moves by diffusion, down the concentration gradient, into the blood. The other consequence of the air arriving in alveoli is that the concentration of [[carbon dioxide]] in the alveoli decreases. This creates a concentration gradient for carbon dioxide to diffuse from the blood into the alveoli, as fresh air has a very low concentration of carbon dioxide compared to the [[blood]] in the body.\n\nThirdly there is another \"bulk flow\" process. The pumping action of the [[heart]] then transports the blood around the body. As the left ventricle of the heart contracts, the volume decreases, which increases the pressure in the ventricle. This creates a pressure gradient between the heart and the capillaries, and blood moves through [[blood vessel]]s by bulk flow down the pressure gradient.\n\n==Diffusion in the context of different disciplines==\n[[File:Centrotherm diffusion furnaces at LAAS 0481.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Diffusion furnaces used for [[thermal oxidation]]]]\nThe concept of diffusion is widely used in: [[physics]] ([[Molecular diffusion|particle diffusion]]), [[chemistry]], [[biology]], [[sociology]], [[economics]], and [[finance]] (diffusion of people, ideas and of price values). However, in each case the object (for example, atom, idea) undergoing diffusion is \"spreading out\" from a point or location at which there is a higher concentration of that object.\n\nThere are two ways to introduce the notion of ''diffusion'': either a [[wikt:phenomenon|phenomenological approach]] starting with [[Fick's laws of diffusion]] and their mathematical consequences, or a physical and atomistic one, by considering the ''[[random walk]] of the diffusing particles''.<ref>J.

According to Fick's laws, the diffusion [[Flux#Flux as flow rate per unit area|flux]] is proportional to the negative [[gradient]] of concentrations. It goes from regions of higher concentration to regions of lower concentration. Sometime later, various generalizations of Fick's laws were developed in the frame of [[thermodynamics]] and [[non-equilibrium thermodynamics]].<ref>S.R. De Groot, P. Mazur (1962). ''Non-equilibrium Thermodynamics''. North-Holland, Amsterdam.</ref>\n\nFrom the ''atomistic point of view'', diffusion is considered as a result of the random walk of the diffusing particles. In [[molecular diffusion]], the moving molecules are self-propelled by thermal energy. Random walk of small particles in suspension in a fluid was discovered in 1827 by [[Robert Brown (botanist, born 1773)|Robert Brown]],he found that minute particle suspended in a liquid medium and just large enough to be visible under an optical microscope exhibit a rapid and continually irregular motion of particles known as Brownian movement. The theory of the [[Brownian motion]] and the atomistic backgrounds of diffusion were developed by [[Albert Einstein]].<ref>{{cite journal|author=A.

For example, oxygen can diffuse through cell membranes so long as there is a higher concentration of oxygen outside the cell. However, because the movement of molecules is random, occasionally oxygen molecules move out of the cell (against the concentration gradient). Because there are more oxygen molecules outside the cell, the [[probability]] that oxygen molecules will enter the cell is higher than the probability that oxygen molecules will leave the cell. Therefore, the \"net\" movement of oxygen molecules (the difference between the number of molecules either entering or leaving the cell) is into the cell. In other words, there is a ''net movement'' of oxygen molecules down the concentration gradient.\n\n==History of diffusion in physics==\nIn the scope of time, diffusion in solids was used long before the theory of diffusion was created. For example, [[Pliny the Elder]] had previously described the [[cementation process]], which produces steel from the element iron (Fe) through carbon diffusion. Another example is well known for many centuries, the diffusion of colors of [[stained glass]] or [[earthenware]] and [[Chinese ceramics]].\n\nIn modern science, the first systematic experimental study of diffusion was performed by [[Thomas Graham (chemist)|Thomas Graham]]. He studied diffusion in gases, and the main phenomenon was described by him in 1831\u20131833:<ref>''Diffusion Processes'', Thomas Graham Symposium, ed. J.N. Sherwood, A.V. Chadwick, W.M.Muir, F.L. Swinton, Gordon and Breach, London, 1971.</ref>\n\n<blockquote>\"...gases of different nature, when brought into contact, do not arrange themselves according to their density, the heaviest undermost, and the lighter uppermost, but they spontaneously diffuse, mutually and equally, through each other, and so remain in the intimate state of mixture for any length of time.\" </blockquote>\n\nThe measurements of Graham contributed to [[James Clerk Maxwell]] deriving, in 1867, the coefficient of diffusion for CO<sub>2</sub> in the air. The error rate is less than 5%.\n\nIn 1855, [[Adolf Fick]], the 26-year-old anatomy demonstrator from Z\u00fcrich, proposed [[Fick's laws of diffusion|his law of diffusion]]. He used Graham's research, stating his goal as \"the development of a fundamental law, for the operation of diffusion in a single element of space\". He asserted a deep analogy between diffusion and conduction of heat or electricity, creating a formalism similar to [[Thermal conduction|Fourier's law for heat conduction]] (1822) and [[Ohm's law]] for electric current (1827).\n\n[[Robert Boyle]] demonstrated diffusion in solids in the 17th century<ref>L.W. Barr (1997), In: ''Diffusion in Materials, DIMAT 96'', ed. H.Mehrer, Chr. Herzig, N.A. Stolwijk, H. Bracht, Scitec Publications, Vol.1, pp. 1\u20139.</ref> by penetration of zinc into a copper coin. Nevertheless, diffusion in solids was not systematically studied until the second part of the 19th century.

In the same year, [[James Clerk Maxwell]] developed the first atomistic theory of transport processes in gases. The modern atomistic theory of diffusion and [[Brownian motion]] was developed by [[Albert Einstein]], [[Marian Smoluchowski]] and [[Jean-Baptiste Perrin]]. [[Ludwig Boltzmann]], in the development of the atomistic backgrounds of the macroscopic [[transport phenomena|transport processes]], introduced the [[Boltzmann equation]], which has served mathematics and physics with a source of transport process ideas and concerns for more than 140 years.<ref name=\"ChapmanCowling\">S.

He studied self-diffusion of radioactive isotopes of lead in the liquid and solid lead.\n\n[[Yakov Frenkel]] (sometimes, Jakov/Jacob Frenkel) proposed, and elaborated in 1926, the idea of diffusion in crystals through local defects (vacancies and [[interstitial defect|interstitial]] atoms). He concluded, the diffusion process in condensed matter is an ensemble of elementary jumps and quasichemical interactions of particles and defects. He introduced several mechanisms of diffusion and found rate constants from experimental data.\n\nSometime later, [[Carl Wagner]] and [[Walter H.

A [[molecule]] or [[ion]] with [[kinetic energy]] (explain) collides with other molecules and ions, and each collision alters the kinetic energy and [[momentum]] of both particles. Unless the particles are bound in position in a solid, they are free to move away from each other until the next collision. Therefore, in a fluid all the particles move from collision to collision, changing direction with each collision. The path of any given particle is random, so the probability of it returning to a previous position is lower than of going somewhere else since there are so many more other places to go. If the fluid is in a container, any collision with the solid container sends it back into the volume of the fluid. The rate at which a given particle moves away from its original position depends on how fast it moves on average, which depends on the temperature, and how often it collides with other particles, which in turn depends on how far apart they are on average. The particles of a gas are much further apart than the particles of a liquid, so a gas molecule or ion generally goes further before colliding and changing direction each time, so it moves away from any given point more quickly, assuming equal velocities.\n\nWhen all particles start out evenly mixed, there is no noticeable difference over time, and they stay evenly mixed. However, if there is a region where most of the particles are of one type at a given time, they tend to disperse until evenly distributed.\n-->\n\n== Basic models of diffusion ==\n\n=== Diffusion flux ===\nEach model of diffusion expresses the '''diffusion flux''' through concentrations, densities and their derivatives. Flux is a vector <math>\\mathbf{J}</math> representing the quantity and direction of transfer. The transfer of a [[physical quantity]] <math>N</math> through a small [[area]] <math>\\Delta S</math> with normal <math>\\nu</math> per time <math>\\Delta t</math> is\n:<math>\\Delta N = (\\mathbf{J},\\nu) \\,\\Delta S \\,\\Delta t +o(\\Delta S \\,\\Delta t)\\, ,</math>\nwhere <math>(\\mathbf{J},\\nu)</math> is the [[inner product]] and <math>o(\\cdots)</math> is the [[little-o notation]].\nIf we use the notation of [[vector area]] <math>\\Delta \\mathbf{S}=\\nu \\, \\Delta S</math> then\n:<math>\\Delta N = (\\mathbf{J}, \\Delta \\mathbf{S}) \\, \\Delta t +o(\\Delta \\mathbf{S} \\,\\Delta t)\\, . </math>\nThe [[Dimensional analysis|dimension]] of the diffusion flux is [flux]&nbsp;=&nbsp;[quantity]/([time]\u00b7[area]).\nThe diffusing physical quantity <math>N</math> may be the number of particles, mass, energy, electric charge, or any other scalar [[extensive quantity]]. For its density, <math>n</math>, the diffusion equation has the form\n:<math>\\frac{\\partial n}{\\partial t}= - \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{J} +W \\, ,</math>\nwhere <math>W</math> is intensity of any local source of this quantity (for example, the rate of a chemical reaction).\nFor the diffusion equation, the '''no-flux boundary conditions''' can be formulated as <math>(\\mathbf{J}(x),\\nu(x))=0</math> on the boundary, where <math>\\nu</math> is the normal to the boundary at point <math>x</math>.\n\n=== Fick's law and equations ===\n{{Main|Fick's laws of diffusion}}\n\nFick's first law: the diffusion flux is proportional to the negative of the concentration gradient:\n:<math>\\mathbf{J}=-D \\,\\nabla n \\ , \\;\\; J_i=-D \\frac{\\partial n}{\\partial x_i} \\ .</math>\nThe corresponding diffusion equation (Fick's second law) is\n:<math>\\frac{\\partial n(x,t)}{\\partial t}=\\nabla\\cdot( D \\,\\nabla n(x,t))=D \\, \\Delta n(x,t)\\ , </math>\nwhere <math>\\Delta</math> is the [[Laplace operator]],\n:<math>\\Delta n(x,t) = \\sum_i \\frac{\\partial^2 n(x,t)}{\\partial x_i^2} \\ .</math>\n\n=== Onsager's equations for multicomponent diffusion and thermodiffusion ===\nFick's law describes diffusion of an admixture in a medium. The concentration of this admixture should be small and the gradient of this concentration should be also small. The driving force of diffusion in Fick's law is the antigradient of concentration, <math>-\\nabla n</math>.\n\nIn 1931, [[Lars Onsager]]<ref name = \"Onsager1931\">{{cite journal|author=Onsager, L. |year=1931|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.37.405|title=Reciprocal Relations in Irreversible Processes.

It should be stressed that the separate diffusion equations describe the mixing or mass transport without bulk motion. Therefore, the terms with variation of the total pressure are neglected. It is possible for diffusion of small admixtures and for small gradients.\n\nFor the linear Onsager equations, we must take the thermodynamic forces in the linear approximation near equilibrium:\n:<math>X_i= \\sum_{k \\geq 0} \\left.\\frac{\\partial^2 s(n)}{\\partial n_i \\, \\partial n_k}\\right|_{n=n^*} \\operatorname{grad} n_k \\ ,</math>\nwhere the derivatives of ''s'' are calculated at equilibrium ''n''<sup>*</sup>.\nThe matrix of the ''kinetic coefficients'' <math>L_{ij}</math> should be symmetric ([[Onsager reciprocal relations]]) and [[Positive-definite matrix|positive definite]] ([[Second law of thermodynamics|for the entropy growth]]).\n\nThe transport equations are\n:<math>\\frac{\\partial n_i}{\\partial t}= - \\operatorname{div} \\mathbf{J}_i =- \\sum_{j\\geq 0} L_{ij}\\operatorname{div} X_j = \\sum_{k\\geq 0} \\left[-\\sum_{j\\geq 0} L_{ij} \\left.\\frac{\\partial^2 s(n)}{\\partial n_j \\, \\partial n_k}\\right|_{n=n^*}\\right] \\, \\Delta n_k\\ .</math>\nHere, all the indexes ''i, j, k''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0,&nbsp;1,&nbsp;2,&nbsp;... are related to the internal energy (0) and various components.

The relevant thermodynamic potential is the free energy (or the [[free entropy]]). The thermodynamic driving forces for the isothermal diffusion are antigradients of chemical potentials, <math>-(1/T)\\,\\nabla\\mu_j</math>, and the matrix of diffusion coefficients is\n:<math>D_{ik}=\\frac{1}{T}\\sum_{j\\geq 1} L_{ij} \\left.\\frac{\\partial \\mu_j(n,T)} { \\partial n_k}\\right|_{n=n^*}</math>\n(''i,k''&nbsp;>&nbsp;0).\n\nThere is intrinsic arbitrariness in the definition of the thermodynamic forces and kinetic coefficients because they are not measurable separately and only their combinations <math>\\sum_j L_{ij}X_j</math> can be measured. For example, in the original work of Onsager<ref name = \"Onsager1931\"/> the thermodynamic forces include additional multiplier ''T'', whereas in the [[Course of Theoretical Physics]]<ref>\n{{cite book\n |author=[[Lev Landau|L.D.

All these changes are supplemented by the corresponding changes in the coefficients and do not affect the measurable quantities.\n\n=== Nondiagonal diffusion must be nonlinear ===\nThe formalism of linear irreversible thermodynamics (Onsager) generates the systems of linear diffusion equations in the form\n:<math>\\frac{\\partial c_i}{\\partial t} = \\sum_j D_{ij} \\, \\Delta c_j.</math>\nIf the matrix of diffusion coefficients is diagonal, then this system of equations is just a collection of decoupled Fick's equations for various components. Assume that diffusion is non-diagonal, for example, <math>D_{12} \\neq 0</math>, and consider the state with <math>c_2 = \\cdots = c_n = 0</math>. At this state, <math>\\partial c_2 / \\partial t = D_{12} \\, \\Delta c_1</math>. If <math>D_{12} \\, \\Delta c_1(x) < 0</math> at some points, then <math>c_2(x)</math> becomes negative at these points in a short time.

The term \"gram-ion\" (\"gram-particle\")  is used for a quantity of a substance that contains [[Avogadro constant|Avogadro's number]] of ions (particles). The common modern term is [[Mole (unit)|mole]].\n\nThe force under isothermal conditions consists of two parts:\n# Diffusion force caused by concentration gradient: <math>-RT \\frac{1}{n} \\, \\nabla n = -RT \\, \\nabla (\\ln(n/n^\\text{eq}))</math>.\n# Electrostatic force caused by electric potential gradient: <math>q \\, \\nabla \\varphi</math>.\nHere ''R'' is the gas constant, ''T'' is the absolute temperature, ''n'' is the concentration, the equilibrium concentration is marked by a superscript \"eq\", ''q'' is the charge and ''\u03c6'' is the electric potential.\n\nThe simple but crucial difference between the Teorell formula and the Onsager laws is the concentration factor in the Teorell expression for the flux. In the Einstein\u2013Teorell approach, If for the finite force the concentration tends to zero then the flux also tends to zero, whereas the Onsager equations violate this simple and physically obvious rule.\n\nThe general formulation of the Teorell formula for non-perfect systems under isothermal conditions is<ref name=GorbanMMNP2011/>\n:<math>\\mathbf{J} = \\mathfrak{m} \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\mu - \\mu_0}{RT}\\right)(-\\nabla \\mu + (\\text{external force per mole})),</math>\nwhere ''\u03bc'' is the [[chemical potential]], ''\u03bc''<sub>0</sub> is the standard value of the chemical potential.\nThe expression <math>a = \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\mu - \\mu_0}{RT}\\right)</math> is the so-called [[Activity (chemistry)|activity]].

So, there exist a combination of diffusion mechanisms in poroous media. To understand this, lets consider the example of ceramic membranes. when a gas enters into a ceramic membrane it undergoes the molecular diffusion when moving through the material of the porous media and knudsen diffusion ( if the diameter of pore is less than the length of the pore) and molecular difussion ( can be self diffusion or mutual diffusion depending on the number of species being diffused) in series when moving in the pores. while moving in the pore the poiseuille diffusion also happens in parrllel with knudsen and molecular diffusion. Depending on the nature of material and operating conditions one or more types of diffusion may not be aplicable be small and can be neglected but basic phenomenon is the same. for more information see <M.

In this case, the elementary mean free path theory of diffusion gives for the diffusion coefficient\n\n:<math>D=\\frac{1}{3} \\ell v_T = \\frac{2}{3}\\sqrt{\\frac{k_{\\rm B}^3}{\\pi^3 m}} \\frac{T^{3/2}}{Pd^2}\\, ,</math>\nwhere ''k''<sub>B</sub> is the [[Boltzmann constant]], ''T'' is the [[temperature]], ''P'' is the [[pressure]], <math>\\ell</math> is the [[mean free path]], and ''v<sub>T</sub>'' is the mean thermal speed:\n:<math>\\ell = \\frac{k_{\\rm B}T}{\\sqrt 2 \\pi d^2 P}\\, , \\;\\;\\; v_T=\\sqrt{\\frac{8k_{\\rm B}T}{\\pi m}}\\, .</math>\nWe can see that the diffusion coefficient in the mean free path approximation grows with ''T'' as ''T''<sup>3/2</sup> and decreases with ''P'' as 1/''P''. If we use for ''P'' the [[ideal gas law]] ''P''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''RnT'' with the total concentration ''n'', then we can see that for given concentration ''n'' the diffusion coefficient grows with ''T'' as ''T''<sup>1/2</sup> and for given temperature it decreases with the total concentration as&nbsp;1/''n''.\n\nFor two different gases, A and B, with molecular masses ''m''<sub>A</sub>, ''m''<sub>B</sub> and molecular diameters ''d''<sub>A</sub>, ''d''<sub>B</sub>, the mean free path estimate of the diffusion coefficient of A in B and B in A is:\n: <math>D_{\\rm AB}=\\frac{2}{3}\\sqrt{\\frac{k_{\\rm B}^3}{\\pi^3}}\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2m_{\\rm A}}+\\frac{1}{2m_{\\rm B}}}\\frac{4T^{3/2}}{P(d_{\\rm A}+d_{\\rm B})^2}\\, ,</math>\n\n=== The theory of diffusion in gases based on Boltzmann's equation ===\nIn Boltzmann's kinetics of the mixture of gases, each gas has its own distribution function, <math>f_i(x,c,t)</math>, where ''t'' is the time moment, ''x'' is position and ''c'' is velocity of molecule of the ''i''th component of the mixture.

If the velocities <math>C_i(x,t)</math> do not coincide then there exists ''diffusion''.\n\nIn the [[Chapman\u2013Enskog theory|Chapman\u2013Enskog]] approximation, all the distribution functions are expressed through the densities of the conserved quantities:<ref name=\"ChapmanCowling\"/>\n* individual concentrations of particles, <math>n_i(x,t)=\\int_c f_i(x,c,t)\\, dc</math> (particles per volume),\n* density of momentum <math>\\sum_i m_i n_i C_i(x,t)</math> (''m<sub>i</sub>'' is the ''i''th particle mass),\n* density of kinetic energy\n:: <math>\\sum_i \\left( n_i\\frac{m_i C^2_i(x,t)}{2} + \\int_c \\frac{m_i (c_i-C_i(x,t))^2}{2} f_i(x,c,t)\\, dc \\right).</math>\nThe kinetic temperature ''T'' and pressure ''P'' are defined in 3D space as\n:<math>\\frac{3}{2}k_{\\rm B} T=\\frac{1}{n} \\int_c \\frac{m_i (c_i-C_i(x,t))^2}{2} f_i(x,c,t)\\, dc; \\quad P=k_{\\rm B}nT,</math>\nwhere <math>n=\\sum_i n_i</math> is the total density.\n\nFor two gases, the difference between velocities, <math>C_1-C_2</math> is given by the expression:<ref name=\"ChapmanCowling\"/>\n: <math>C_1-C_2=-\\frac{n^2}{n_1n_2}D_{12}\\left\\{ \\nabla \\left(\\frac{n_1}{n} \\right)+ \\frac{n_1n_2 (m_2-m_1)}{P n (m_1n_1+m_2n_2)}\\nabla P- \\frac{m_1n_1m_2n_2}{P(m_1n_1+m_2n_2)}(F_1-F_2)+k_T \\frac{1}{T}\\nabla T\\right\\},</math>\nwhere <math>F_i</math> is the force applied to the molecules of the ''i''th component and <math>k_T</math> is the thermodiffusion ratio.\n\nThe coefficient ''D''<sub>12</sub> is positive.

For example, in the Earth's gravitational field, the heavier molecules should go down, or in electric field the charged molecules should move, until this effect is not equilibrated by the sum of other terms. This effect should not be confused with barodiffusion caused by the pressure gradient.\n# <math>k_T \\frac{1}{T}\\nabla T</math> describes [[thermodiffusion]], the diffusion flux caused by the temperature gradient.\n\nAll these effects are called ''diffusion'' because they describe the differences between velocities of different components in the mixture. Therefore, these effects cannot be described as a ''bulk'' transport and differ from advection or convection.\n\nIn the first approximation,<ref name=\"ChapmanCowling\"/>\n* <math>D_{12}=\\frac{3}{2n(d_1+d_2)^2}\\left[\\frac{kT(m_1+m_2)}{2\\pi m_1m_2} \\right]^{1/2}</math> for rigid spheres;\n* <math>D_{12}=\\frac{3}{8nA_1({\\nu})\\Gamma(3-\\frac{2}{\\nu-1})} \\left[\\frac{kT(m_1+m_2)}{2\\pi m_1m_2}\\right]^{1/2} \\left(\\frac{2kT}{\\kappa_{12}} \\right)^{\\frac{2}{\\nu-1}}</math> for repulsing force <math>\\kappa_{12}r^{-\\nu}.</math>\nThe number <math>A_1({\\nu})</math> is defined by quadratures (formulas (3.7), (3.9), Ch. 10 of the classical Chapman and Cowling book<ref name=\"ChapmanCowling\"/>)\n\nWe can see that the dependence on ''T'' for the rigid spheres is the same as for the simple mean free path theory but for the power repulsion laws the exponent is different. Dependence on a total concentration ''n'' for a given temperature has always the same character, 1/''n''.\n\nIn applications to gas dynamics, the diffusion flux and the bulk flow should be joined in one system of transport equations. The bulk flow describes the mass transfer. Its velocity ''V'' is the mass average velocity. It is defined through the momentum density and the mass concentrations:\n:<math>V=\\frac{\\sum_i \\rho_i C_i} \\rho \\, .</math>\nwhere <math>\\rho_i =m_i n_i</math> is the mass concentration of the ''i''th species, <math>\\rho=\\sum_i \\rho_i</math> is the mass density.\n\nBy definition, the diffusion velocity of the ''i''th component is <math>v_i=C_i-V</math>, <math>\\sum_i \\rho_i v_i=0</math>.\nThe mass transfer of the ''i''th component is described by the [[continuity equation]]\n:<math>\\frac{\\partial \\rho_i}{\\partial t}+\\nabla(\\rho_i V) + \\nabla (\\rho_i v_i) = W_i \\, ,</math>\nwhere <math>W_i</math> is the net mass production rate in chemical reactions, <math>\\sum_i W_i= 0</math>.\n\nIn these equations, the term <math>\\nabla(\\rho_i V)</math> describes advection of the ''i''th component and the term <math>\\nabla (\\rho_i v_i)</math> represents diffusion of this component.\n\nIn 1948, [[Wendell H. Furry]] proposed to use the ''form'' of the diffusion rates found in kinetic theory as a framework for the new phenomenological approach to diffusion in gases.

For example, when a bias is applied to two ends of a chunk of semiconductor, or a light shines on one end (see right figure), electron diffuse from high density regions (center) to low density regions (two ends), forming a gradient of electron density. This process generates current, referred to as [[diffusion current]].\n\nDiffusion current can also be described by [[Fick's laws of diffusion|Fick's first law]]\n:<math>J=- D \\, \\partial n/\\partial x\\, ,</math>\nwhere ''J'' is the diffusion current density ([[amount of substance]]) per unit area per unit time, ''n'' (for ideal mixtures) is the electron density, ''x'' is the position [length].\n\n=== Diffusion in geophysics ===\nAnalytical and numerical models that solve the diffusion equation for different initial and boundary conditions have been popular for studying a wide variety of changes to the Earth's surface.

Substances appear to move randomly due to collisions with other substances. From the iBook ''Cell Membrane Transport'', free license granted by IS3D, LLC, 2014.]] One common misconception is that individual atoms, ions or molecules move randomly, which they do not. In the animation on the right, the ion on in the left panel has a \"random\" motion, but this motion is not random as it is the result of \"collisions\" with other ions. As such, the movement of a single atom, ion, or molecule within a mixture just appears random when viewed in isolation. The movement of a substance within a mixture by \"random walk\" is governed by the kinetic energy within the system that can be affected by changes in concentration, pressure or temperature.\n\n=== Separation of diffusion from convection in gases ===\nWhile Brownian motion of multi-molecular mesoscopic particles (like pollen grains studied by Brown) is observable under an optical microscope, molecular diffusion can only be probed in carefully controlled experimental conditions. Since Graham experiments, it is well known that avoiding of convection is necessary and this may be a non-trivial task.\n\nUnder normal conditions, molecular diffusion dominates only on length scales between nanometer and millimeter. On larger length scales, transport in liquids and gases is normally due to another [[transport phenomena|transport phenomenon]], [[convection]], and to study diffusion on the larger scale, special efforts are needed.\n\nTherefore, some often cited examples of diffusion are ''wrong'': If cologne is sprayed in one place, it can soon be smelled in the entire room, but a simple calculation shows that this can't be due to diffusion. Convective motion persists in the room because of the temperature [inhomogeneity]. If ink is dropped in water, one usually observes an inhomogeneous evolution of the spatial distribution, which clearly indicates convection (caused, in particular, by this dropping).{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}\n\nIn contrast, [[heat conduction]] through solid media is an everyday occurrence (for example, a metal spoon partly immersed in a hot liquid).

He was originally a [[linotype machine|linotyper]] for the ''Daily Courier'' who became jealous of his boss's success; later, he becomes a criminal mastermind under the name Psycho-Pirate. He plans crimes based on emotions, hoping to ruin his boss. Nothing is known of the life of Charles Halstead before he became a linotyper at the ''Daily Courier''. A long-time employee, Halstead was a friend and favorite of publisher Rex Morgan. Secretly, however, Halstead was frustrated with his lack of advancement at the paper and, at some point, snapped. He resolved to take what he had never been able to earn and his first target was the paper itself. He began to stage a series of crimes based on emotions (hate, greed, etc.), cluing the ''Courier'' with leads to his crimes.\n\nAs time passed, Halstead, as the Psycho-Pirate, became bolder. He penned a letter to the ''Courier'', challenging the [[Justice Society]] to stop a new wave of crimes based on a variety of emotions. For example, he engendered fear into the inhabitants of a city where he threatened to unleash a deadly plague until his plan was halted by [[Dr. Mid-Nite]]. Each JSAer was given an emotion and a task to solve. With the JSA dispersed and only [[The Atom (Al Pratt)|the Atom]] to guard Halstead, the Psycho-Pirate began a campaign to demoralize the publisher with constant news of despair: business failure, divorce, foreclosure\u2014a series of lies designed to crush the spirit of his employer. To remove the Atom, he convinced the hero that the JSA had been captured and sent the Mighty Mite to rescue them. The Atom discovered the ruse and defeated the criminal's henchmen disguised as JSAers. In doing so, the Atom discovered the true identity of the Psycho-Pirate, who shot him to preserve his secrecy. Wounded, the Atom made it to the ''Courier'' just as the JSA returned and exposed Halstead as the Psycho-Pirate. Halstead was subsequently sentenced to a lengthy prison term after the Justice Society of America captured and put him in jail. He escaped by playing on the emotions of a guard, but the JSA heard of his plans from his cellmate and were able to recapture him. He continued to research the mysticism of emotions until his death sometime in the 1960s.\n\n===Roger Hayden===\nRoger Hayden first appeared as the second Psycho-Pirate in ''Showcase #56'', created by Gardner Fox and [[Murphy Anderson]].\n[[File:Showcase 56.jpg|thumbnail|left|The first appearance of the second '''Psycho-Pirate'''. Cover to ''[[Showcase (comics)|Showcase]]'' #56. Art by [[Murphy Anderson]].]]\n\nRoger Hayden is a jailed gangster (later [[retcon]]ned into a young 20-year-old who was sentenced to a year in prison for attacking his emotionally abusive psychiatrist father) who is a cellmate to Halstead on [[Earth-Two]].<ref>Earth-Two was established as a parallel world that served as the home of the [[Justice Society of America]], as well as other DC Comics characters introduced during the [[Golden Age of Comic Books]]. ''Flash'' (vol. 1) #123 (September 1961).</ref>  Halstead's dying wish, to have a legacy, prompts him to tell Hayden of a secret which he has divined in his jail years: the existence of the Medusa Masks. These golden masks bestow upon the wearer the power to project emotions onto others. Hayden finds these masks, merges them into a single faceplate and uses its powers to become a supervillain. It becomes increasingly apparent that he is addicted to absorbing others' emotions, though it causes him pain, possibly brought on by the combination of all of the masks into one. He is eventually imprisoned after a battle with  [[Doctor Fate]] and [[Hourman]].\n\nHayden returns to prominence when he insidiously begins influencing prominent [[Gotham City]] citizens [[Bruce Wayne]] and [[Alan Scott]]; the former a wealthy businessman and now commissioner of Gotham's police force; the latter the president of the television station WXYZ. Initially, Scott is the most affected as he, in his Green Lantern persona, begins exercising his frustrations upon humanity for the failures of his private life, such as the impending bankruptcy of his station. After creating a disturbance at Gotham International Airport, he is subdued by his [[Justice Society]] comrades, who assist both Scott and teammate [[Jay Garrick|Flash]], who had also been under Hayden's control. The Society has to next battle a civil war within their membership instigated by Wayne, still under Hayden's control and determined to rid Gotham of all superheroes.\n\nHayden later joins the [[Secret Society of Super Villains]], having been recruited by the [[Ultra-Humanite]] to defeat Hayden's old foe Hourman. While he is initially successful thanks to a device the Ultra-Humanite devises that amplifies and projects Hayden's face and hence his control, ultimately both the Justice Society and the [[Justice League]] defeat Hayden and his teammates after their betrayal of fellow Secret Society members. The villains are deposited into an interdimensional rift known as [[Limbo (DC Comics)|Limbo]].\n\nFrom there, the Ultra-Humanite gains mental contact with his younger self from the 1940s, and the two {{not a typo|Ultra-Human|ites}} are able to pull the Secret Society, including Hayden, back to that era, where they confront and are defeated by the [[All-Star Squadron]] and the time-lost [[Infinity Inc.]]\n\n====''Crisis on Infinite Earths''====\nIn the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]], the [[Monitor (comics)|Monitor]] recruits Hayden\u2014who goes on to help [[Firestorm (comics)|Firestorm]] recruit his enemy [[Killer Frost]] to the Monitor's team by making her fall in love with Firestorm\u2014but Hayden is quickly abducted by the [[Anti-Monitor]]. In exchange for an entire world and all of its inhabitants' emotions to play with, Psycho-Pirate becomes an accomplice to the Anti-Monitor, manipulating a captive [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]]. The Flash's powers are briefly enhanced so that Hayden can control the remaining three alternate Earths at the time (Earth-4, Earth-S, and Earth-X) so that their heroes are provoked into attacking teams sent to rescue them. Psycho Pirate's use of his powers on this scale causes him to \"burn out\" so that he cannot use his powers again afterward. Although the Anti-Monitor constantly belittles the Psycho-Pirate, he keeps him around in case his emotion-manipulating abilities prove useful later on and because he lacks the time to find or create someone else with the same powers. After the resolution of the Crisis, Psycho-Pirate is one of very few individuals to have full memories of the event. Driven mad by these memories, the Psycho-Pirate is shown in the last few panels of 'Crisis' in a straitjacket.\n\n====Post-''Crisis''====\nFollowing the events of ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'', Hayden escapes Arkham Asylum and encounters a renegade 5th Dimension Thunderbolt genie who had merged with private investigator Jonnie Thunder. In the pages of ''Infinity, Inc.'' #30-34, the two bedevil the members of Infinity, Inc. in a bid to destroy Jonnie's mind so that the Thunderbolt can seize total control over her body. During the arc it is shown that the renegade Thunderbolt repeatedly electroshocked Psycho-Pirate upon recruiting him. Although this was done to \"cure\" Hayden of the madness he was suffering from, the electroshock had the side effect of making Psycho Pirate loses all memories of the ''Crisis'' and the existence of parallel Earths.\n\nDefeated, Hayden relocates to Markovia and impersonates the villain [[Baron Bedlam]] in order to gain power in the nation. In a story that spanned two specials (''Outsiders Special'' and ''Infinity, Inc. Special''), the Outsiders and Infinity, Inc. defeat and imprison Psycho-Pirate.\n\nHayden shows up again in [[Grant Morrison]]'s run on ''[[Animal Man]]'', imprisoned in [[Arkham Asylum]]. The effects of the electroshocks given to him by the renegade Thunderbolt have worn off and Hayden's memories of the ''Crisis'' and of the prior existence of multiple Earths are restored. Psycho Pirate ends up releasing characters destroyed during the ''Crisis'' back into the world. Many of these characters later come to realize they are just characters in a comic book. After an intervention by Animal Man, Hayden, seemingly happy, fades away into nothingness. Psycho Pirate's happiness is due to a relief of the strain from releasing all of the forgotten characters, but he is consequently removed from reality and placed back in [[Limbo (DC Comics)|Limbo]]. James Highwater, one of the Asylum staff, is left to wear the Medusa Mask and keep the forgotten Earths contained. The other staff members come to accept Highwater as a patient, not realizing his knowledge of the missing worlds.\n\nAt some point, the Medusa Mask is held by the [[Force of July]]. Abraham Lincoln Carlyle, who shelters the Force, claims to have gotten the mask from Hayden and to have learned how to use it by watching him. He tries to use the mask, unsuccessfully, against [[Shade, the Changing Man]] as his team falls under attack from the [[Suicide Squad]], however his heart fails him and Carlyle dies.<ref>''Suicide Squad'' #27, 1989</ref>\n\nPsycho-Pirate does not appear again until 1995 when he became part of the ''[[Underworld Unleashed]]'' crossover event. In this story Psycho-Pirate, along with several other villians, sells his soul to the demon [[Neron (DC Comics)|Neron]] in exchange for more power. The process results in a costume change for the character as well, with Hayden now wearing a black leather jacket and with the metal of his mask morphing into an eyepatch and replacing about half of his brain. Once again sane, and making no allusion to the events of ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'' and the existence of the Multiverse, Psycho-Pirate goes on to fight the Chase Lawler version of [[Manhunter (comics)#Chase Lawler|Manhunter]] before being arrested and sent to jail.\n\nAfter his appearance in the ''Fate'' series, Psycho-Pirate makes two brief appearances during the ''Joker: Last Laugh'' crossover event. He is first seen locked up in the maximum security prison called the \"Slab\". Psycho Pirate is again insane and rambling of the existence of the Multiverse and is seen in his original costume. All but one eye of the Pirate's face is covered and his eyebrows have been shaved off to reduce his ability to express emotion. The [[Joker (character)|Joker]] initiates a breakout and infection of the inmates, causing them to follow his orders and commit dangerous pranks. Psycho Pirate is seen shouting \"Fire!\" in a crowded theatre during the breakout.\n\n====''Infinite Crisis''====\n{{Main|Infinite Crisis}}\nPsycho-Pirate reappears in the ''JSA Classified'' #1\u20134 story arc, in which he reveals that he and Power Girl are refugees from Earth-Two. Along with several other individuals (such as [[Donna Troy]] and her evil alter ego Dark Angel), both Psycho Pirate and Power Girl were \"missed\" in the restructuring of the Multiverse into a single universe following the events of ''Crisis on Infinite Earths.'' This revelation restores the original origin story of Power Girl as well.\n[[File:Deathpp.PNG|200px|left|Psycho-Pirate's death at the hands of [[Black Adam]]. Art by [[Phil Jimenez]].|thumb]]\nPsycho-Pirate hopes to weaken Power Girl mentally so that she can be captured as part of [[Alexander Luthor, Jr.]]'s plot to unite and control characters who had originally been from universes destroyed during ''Crisis on Infinite Earths''. Failing at this, Psycho-Pirate flees and vows to make Power Girl his love slave once Luthor is finished with her.\n\nWhen [[Dick Grayson|Nightwing]], [[Superboy (Kon-El)|Superboy]], and [[Wonder Girl]] attack Luthor's base, they free all the captive heroes, including Power Girl and [[Black Adam]], who are then confronted by the Psycho-Pirate. Black Adam proceeds to gouge out the Psycho-Pirate's eyes and pushes the Medusa Mask through his head, killing him.\n\nPsycho-Pirate is mentioned in ''Justice League of America'' #1 as selling emotional states, such as \"happy\" and \"ecstatic\", much like a drug dealer. Among his reported clients are [[Signalman (comics)|Signalman]] and Silver Ghost. Psycho-Pirate's Medusa Mask is also featured in the 2008 ''[[Raven (DC Comics)|Raven]]'' miniseries. In the story's conclusion, Raven destroyed the mask but its power still affected scientists who studied its schematics on a computer.\n\n===''Blackest Night''===\nIn the ''[[Blackest Night]]'' storyline, Psycho-Pirate has been identified as one of the deceased who are entombed below the [[Hall of Justice (comics)|Hall of Justice]].<ref>''Blackest Night'' #1 (July 2009)</ref> Psycho-Pirate's corpse is revived as a [[Black Lantern Corps|Black Lantern]] during the event.<ref>''Blackest Night'' #3 (September 2009)</ref> He attacks Smallville, using his powers to manipulate the inhabitants and sway [[Superboy (Kon-El)|Conner Kent]] into attacking Superman.

Clark and Conner decide to separate, with Conner confronting Psycho-Pirate. Conner manages to withstand his emotional manipulation attempts and steals the Medusa Mask, which has been reconstructed via the black ring. Using the artifact, Conner inspires hope, will, and compassion, ending the riots in Smallville. Psycho-Pirate is last seen retreating into a dark alley, followed by Conner. Conner then uses the Medusa Mask on Kal-L, causing the black rings to malfunction and turning both Psycho-Pirate and Kal-L back into inanimate corpses.<ref>''Blackest Night: Superman'' #3 (2009)</ref>\n\n===''The New 52''===\nIn September 2011, ''[[The New 52]]'' rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, a new Psycho-Pirate first appears in ''Superboy'' Vol. 6 #23 as a member of the Twenty, a group of people who are infected by [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac]] with a psionic virus, thus giving them all psionic abilities. He was captured by the [[H.I.V.E.]] Queen, another member of the Twenty who had become a zealous devotee of Brainiac. He managed to escape and sought out the Medusa Mask, an artifact that he believed would protect him against other people with psychic powers. He then spent the next four years hiding other psychics from H.I.V.E. who were using the people they captured to power their operations in [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]].<ref>''Action Comics'' Vol. 3 #24</ref>\n\nDuring the Psi-War storyline, the Psycho-Pirate appears and takes out [[Hector Hammond]] and the H.I.V.E. Queen, who were both fighting for control of the city. When [[Superman]] arrives at H.I.V.E.'s headquarters, Hayden confronts him and drains his mind too. He is then surprised by [[Lois Lane]], who was infected with the same psionic virus by Senator Hume, yet another member of the Twenty. The two fight, with Hayden getting the upper hand. He then proceeds to make Metropolis' citizens act on pure emotion, creating riots and chaos throughout the streets. A recovered Superman, Lois Lane, Hector Hammond, and the H.I.V.E. Queen then team up to fight the Pirate and a fierce battle ensues, during which the Queen and Hammond are beaten. Superman manages to pull the Medusa Mask off of Hayden's face and incinerates it with his heat vision, defeating the Psycho-Pirate. However, he disappears in the aftermath of the battle.<ref>''Superman'' Vol. 3 #23-24</ref>\n\nAt the same time as he was clashing with Superman, Roger Hayden also sent an astral projection to confront [[Superboy]] and [[Doctor Psycho]] who are in [[New York City]] looking for a psychic called Shift. He reveals that Psycho was only manipulating Superboy to get his power. A three-way battle ensues between the three characters, which ends with Doctor Psycho being defeated and Superboy falling unconscious, only to wake up in a cell powerless.<ref>''Superboy'' Vol. 6 #23-24</ref>\n\n===''DC Rebirth''===\nPsycho-Pirate and [[Hugo Strange]] are sent to [[Gotham City|Gotham]] as part of [[Amanda Waller]]'s [[Task Force X]]. As soon as they arrive, Hugo Strange deviates from their mission and uses Psycho-Pirate to infect Gotham City's newest heroes, Gotham and Gotham Girl, with overwhelming rage and fear, respectively, causing Gotham to go on a murderous rampage. With this accomplished, Strange trades the Psycho-Pirate to [[Bane (DC Comics)|Bane]], who wants the Pirate to help him overcome the horrors of his childhood and his addiction to Venom. When [[Batman]] learns of this, he forms his own Suicide Squad with the [[Bronze Tiger]], the [[Ventriloquist (comics)|Ventriloquist]], [[Catwoman]], and [[Punch and Jewelee]]. Together, they infiltrate Bane's prison fortress on the island of [[Santa Prisca (DC Comics)|Santa Prisca]] and retrieve the Psycho-Pirate. Batman returns the Pirate to Gotham City and uses him to reverse the emotional damage that he did to Gotham Girl.<ref>''Batman'' (2016-) Vol. #1-3</ref>\n\nThe Medusa Mask is taken into Batman's custody. When Batman accidentally puts the blood-stained smiley face button from the corpse of Edward Blake (the Comedian) left in Batman's Batcave by Dr. Manhattan, next to the Medusa Mask, both artifacts create an energy reaction that attracts the attention of the [[Eobard Thawne|Reverse Flash (Eobard Thawne).]] The Reverse Flash is then killed by Dr. Manhattan, but not before the Medusa Mask manifests the erased-from-existence [[Flash (Jay Garrick)|Jay Garrick]]; who frantically attempts to warn Batman and Flash of Manhattan's evil scheme to alter the timeline so as to eliminate the Justice League and a create a darker, more cynical Superman, and a version of the Flashpoint Universe Thomas Wayne, who begs Batman to give up his costumed identity for a normal existence.<ref>''Batman'' #20-21 and ''Flash'' #20-21</ref>\n\nShortly after those events, Hayden has the Medusa Mask returned to him by agents of Bane. From there, it is revealed in the wake of the aborted Batman and Catwoman wedding that Hugo Strange, Psycho-Pirate and Gotham Girl were actually working together in secret with Bane, and that Psycho-Pirate has resurrected the ''Flashpoint'' Batman from the dead, to aid in Bane's scheme.\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nCharles Halstead has no superhuman powers; he is, however, a brilliant criminal mind with an excellent grasp of human psychology and emotions.\n\nWith the Medusa Mask, Roger Hayden is able to project emotions into people. Often, it seems to intensify emotions that a person already feels, no matter how small. Hayden later shows the power to manifest DC Multiverse characters that had been destroyed during the Crisis on Infinite Earths. This power expands to any Multiverse character, including the still-living. Psycho-Pirate has also shown some sort of regeneration of body control, as he is able to reform after being crushed by Power Girl, and also disguises himself as a Legion flight ring.\n\nDuring his '90s revamp, Psycho-Pirate was an \"psychic vampire\", able to drain emotions from people.\n\nFollowing the ''New 52'' reboot, Roger Hayden is depicted as a psychic who specializes in telepathically manipulating people's emotions. Examples include: calming a person to make them more reasonable or amplifying negative emotions such as fear or anger to the point of sending people into a murderous frenzy. While wearing the Medusa Mask, Hayden's emotion-manipulating powers were increased to the point where he could control all of Metropolis without straining himself. The mask also provided him with a number of other abilities, including shielding his mind against intrusion from other telepaths; levitation; draining other psi-powered individuals of their mental energies to increase his own; projecting psionic constructs in the form of giant orange snakes which he used to attack; forming a psychic link with another person; projecting his mind over tremendous distances, essentially granting him omnipresence; deflecting psionic attacks; projecting bolts of psionic energy; and creating illusions.\n\n==In other media==\n===Television===\n* In ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'', the Roger Hayden version of Psycho-Pirate makes a cameo appearance as a member of [[Gorilla Grodd]]'s [[Secret Society of Super Villains|Secret Society]]. He has no lines and takes no significant action in any episode. Notably, he is lacking the Medusa Mask.\n* The Roger Hayden incarnation of Psycho-Pirate appears in ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'', voiced by [[Armin Shimerman]]. In the episode \"Inside the Outsiders\", he is a sadist who kidnaps the group of teenage heroes known as the [[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]] ([[Black Lightning]], [[Katana (comics)|Katana]] and [[Metamorpho]]) and feeds off their rage caused by twisted nightmares. Batman goes inside their minds to save them, but Psycho-Pirate fakes his victory, almost causing Batman to feed him rage by pretending to kill the Outsiders. Batman realizes this, and thinks positive thoughts, starving the villain, and defeating him. Psycho-Pirate also made a cameo appearance in \"Mayhem of the Music Meister\" in the musical number \"Drives Us Bats\", as one of the patients at Arkham Asylum mesmerized into singing by the [[Music Meister]].\n* In the ''[[Constantine (TV series)|Constantine]]'' episode \"Blessed are the Damned\", the Medusa Mask is briefly seen among the artifacts stored in Jasper Winter's house.\n* In ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]'' episode \"Nora\", [[Nora West-Allen]] reveals a newspaper from 2049 to her father, [[Barry Allen (Arrowverse)|Barry Allen]] about his disappearance in 2024. The newspaper includes a quote from Roger Hayden a.k.a. Psycho-Pirate, who claims to remember the events of the Flash's final battle with the [[Eobard Thawne (Arrowverse)|Reverse-Flash]] and Flash's disappearance, who says, \"Worlds lived, worlds died. Nothing will ever be the same.\"\n* The Roger Hayden incarnation of Psycho-Pirate made his live action debut in the DCTV crossover \"[[Elseworlds (Arrowverse)|Elseworlds]]\", portrayed by [[Bob Frazer]].<ref name=\"Frazer\">{{cite web |url=https://ew.com/tv/2018/11/02/arrowverse-elseworlds-crossover-psycho-pirate/ |title=Arrowverse 'Elseworlds' crossover to feature DC villain Psycho-Pirate |last=Agard |first=Chancellor |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |date=November 2, 2018 |accessdate=November 2, 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20181102211618/https://ew.com/tv/2018/11/02/arrowverse-elseworlds-crossover-psycho-pirate/ |archivedate=November 2, 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref> In the second part of the crossover, Hayden is part of a group of inmates attempting to escape from [[Arkham Asylum]] after being released by [[Doctor Destiny|John Deegan]] before being stopped by [[Batwoman]]. In the final part, he reappears in his cell with his signature mask with a disfigured Deegan as his neighbor, cryptically quoting, \"Worlds will live, worlds will die and the universe [[Crisis on Infinite Earths|will never be the same]].\"\n\n===Video games===\n*The Roger Hayden version of Psycho-Pirate appears as a playable character in ''[[Lego DC Super-Villains]]'', with Armin Shimerman reprising the role from the ''Batman: The Brave and the Bold'' series.\n\n===Miscellaneous===\n* In the ''Justice League Adventures'' Issue #20 story \"Emotional Baggage\", Roger Hayden is a former psychiatrist (suspended for malpractice) whose wife and son died during an alien attack in Metropolis that the Justice League was involved in. He blames the League for this, displacing his own guilt. To exact revenge, he steals the Medusa Mask and becomes the Psycho-Pirate, first turning civilians against the League and then using the members' deeply hidden resentments to turn them against each other. By shape-shifting the emotion centers of his brain, Martian Manhunter frees himself and stops the Pirate's rampage by going into Hayden's memories of his family. Hayden is later seen in a straitjacket after this; doctors believe that the Medusa Mask has driven him insane. However, the \"horrors\" they say he is experiencing in his mind turn out to be him telling his wife and son that he loves them.\n* Psycho-Pirate appears as the primary antagonist of a special one-shot ''[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice]]'' issue published for [[Free Comic Book Day]]. He is shown working with [[Atomic Skull]] as part of a scheme to steal [[plutonium]] from a [[STAR Labs]] facility. Psycho-Pirate uses his Medusa Mask to force [[Superboy (Kon-El)|Superboy]], [[Miss Martian]], [[Aqualad (Jackson Hyde)|Aqualad]], [[Robin (Dick Grayson)|Robin]], and [[Kid Flash (Wally West)|Kid Flash]] to confront their inner demons, but is defeated and captured when Kid Flash breaks out of the illusion and removes the Medusa Mask from Psycho-Pirate's face.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.dialbforblog.com/archives/193 Fanpage about the Psycho-Pirate (both Halstead and Hayden)]\n{{Timeline\n|before= \u2190 The character Solomon Grundy was debuted by Alfred Bester and Paul Reinman.

He was originally a [[linotype machine|linotyper]] for the ''Daily Courier'' who became jealous of his boss's success; later, he becomes a criminal mastermind under the name Psycho-Pirate. He plans crimes based on emotions, hoping to ruin his boss. Nothing is known of the life of Charles Halstead before he became a linotyper at the ''Daily Courier''. A long-time employee, Halstead was a friend and favorite of publisher Rex Morgan. Secretly, however, Halstead was frustrated with his lack of advancement at the paper and, at some point, snapped. He resolved to take what he had never been able to earn and his first target was the paper itself. He began to stage a series of crimes based on emotions (hate, greed, etc.), cluing the ''Courier'' with leads to his crimes.\n\nAs time passed, Halstead, as the Psycho-Pirate, became bolder. He penned a letter to the ''Courier'', challenging the [[Justice Society]] to stop a new wave of crimes based on a variety of emotions. For example, he engendered fear into the inhabitants of a city where he threatened to unleash a deadly plague until his plan was halted by [[Dr. Mid-Nite]]. Each JSAer was given an emotion and a task to solve. With the JSA dispersed and only [[The Atom (Al Pratt)|the Atom]] to guard Halstead, the Psycho-Pirate began a campaign to demoralize the publisher with constant news of despair: business failure, divorce, foreclosure\u2014a series of lies designed to crush the spirit of his employer. To remove the Atom, he convinced the hero that the JSA had been captured and sent the Mighty Mite to rescue them. The Atom discovered the ruse and defeated the criminal's henchmen disguised as JSAers. In doing so, the Atom discovered the true identity of the Psycho-Pirate, who shot him to preserve his secrecy. Wounded, the Atom made it to the ''Courier'' just as the JSA returned and exposed Halstead as the Psycho-Pirate. Halstead was subsequently sentenced to a lengthy prison term after the Justice Society of America captured and put him in jail. He escaped by playing on the emotions of a guard, but the JSA heard of his plans from his cellmate and were able to recapture him. He continued to research the mysticism of emotions until his death sometime in the 1960s.\n\n===Roger Hayden===\nRoger Hayden first appeared as the second Psycho-Pirate in ''Showcase #56'', created by Gardner Fox and [[Murphy Anderson]].\n[[File:Showcase 56.jpg|thumbnail|left|The first appearance of the second '''Psycho-Pirate'''. Cover to ''[[Showcase (comics)|Showcase]]'' #56. Art by [[Murphy Anderson]].]]\n\nRoger Hayden is a jailed gangster (later [[retcon]]ned into a young 20-year-old who was sentenced to a year in prison for attacking his emotionally abusive psychiatrist father) who is a cellmate to Halstead on [[Earth-Two]].<ref>Earth-Two was established as a parallel world that served as the home of the [[Justice Society of America]], as well as other DC Comics characters introduced during the [[Golden Age of Comic Books]]. ''Flash'' (vol. 1) #123 (September 1961).</ref>  Halstead's dying wish, to have a legacy, prompts him to tell Hayden of a secret which he has divined in his jail years; the existence of the Medusa Masks. These golden masks bestow upon the wearer the power to project emotions onto others. Hayden finds these masks, merges them into a single faceplate and uses its powers to become a supervillain. It becomes increasingly apparent that he is addicted to absorbing others' emotions, though it causes him pain, possibly brought on by the combination of all of the masks into one. He is eventually imprisoned after a battle with  [[Doctor Fate]] and [[Hourman]].\n\nHayden returns to prominence when he insidiously begins influencing prominent [[Gotham City]] citizens [[Bruce Wayne]] and [[Alan Scott]]; the former a wealthy businessman and now commissioner of Gotham's police force; the latter the president of the television station WXYZ. Initially, Scott is the most affected as he, in his Green Lantern persona, begins exercising his frustrations upon humanity for the failures of his private life, such as the impending bankruptcy of his station. After creating a disturbance at Gotham International Airport, he is subdued by his [[Justice Society]] comrades, who assist both Scott and teammate [[Jay Garrick|Flash]], who had also been under Hayden's control. The Society has to next battle a civil war within their membership instigated by Wayne, still under Hayden's control and determined to rid Gotham of all superheroes.\n\nHayden later joins the [[Secret Society of Super Villains]], having been recruited by the [[Ultra-Humanite]] to defeat Hayden's old foe Hourman. While he is initially successful thanks to a device the Ultra-Humanite devises that amplifies and projects Hayden's face and hence his control, ultimately both the Justice Society and the [[Justice League]] defeat Hayden and his teammates after their betrayal of fellow Secret Society members. The villains are deposited into an interdimensional rift known as [[Limbo (DC Comics)|Limbo]].\n\nFrom there, the Ultra-Humanite gains mental contact with his younger self from the 1940s, and the two {{not a typo|Ultra-Human|ites}} are able to pull the Secret Society, including Hayden, back to that era, where they confront and are defeated by the [[All-Star Squadron]] and the time-lost [[Infinity Inc.]]\n\n====''Crisis on Infinite Earths''====\nIn the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]], the [[Monitor (comics)|Monitor]] recruits Hayden\u2014who goes on to help [[Firestorm (comics)|Firestorm]] recruit his enemy [[Killer Frost]] to the Monitor's team by making her fall in love with Firestorm\u2014but Hayden is quickly abducted by the [[Anti-Monitor]]. In exchange for an entire world and all of its inhabitants' emotions to play with, Psycho-Pirate becomes an accomplice to the Anti-Monitor, manipulating a captive [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]]. The Flash's powers are briefly enhanced so that Hayden can control the remaining three alternate Earths at the time (Earth-4, Earth-S, and Earth-X) so that their heroes are provoked into attacking teams sent to rescue them. Psycho Pirate's use of his powers on this scale causes him to \"burn out\" so that he cannot use his powers again afterward. Although the Anti-Monitor constantly belittles the Psycho-Pirate, he keeps him around in case his emotion-manipulating abilities prove useful later on and because he lacks the time to find or create someone else with the same powers. After the resolution of the Crisis, Psycho-Pirate is one of very few individuals to have full memories of the event. Driven mad by these memories, the Psycho-Pirate is shown in the last few panels of 'Crisis' in a straitjacket.\n\n====Post-''Crisis''====\nFollowing the events of ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'', Hayden escapes Arkham Asylum and encounters a renegade 5th Dimension Thunderbolt genie who had merged with private investigator Jonnie Thunder. In the pages of ''Infinity, Inc.'' #30-34, the two bedevil the members of Infinity, Inc. in a bid to destroy Jonnie's mind so that the Thunderbolt can seize total control over her body. During the arc it is shown that the renegade Thunderbolt repeatedly electroshocked Psycho-Pirate upon recruiting him. Although this was done to \"cure\" Hayden of the madness he was suffering from, the electroshock had the side effect of making Psycho Pirate loses all memories of the ''Crisis'' and the existence of parallel Earths.\n\nDefeated, Hayden relocates to Markovia and impersonates the villain [[Baron Bedlam]] in order to gain power in the nation. In a story that spanned two specials (''Outsiders Special'' and ''Infinity, Inc. Special''), the Outsiders and Infinity, Inc. defeat and imprison Psycho-Pirate.\n\nHayden shows up again in [[Grant Morrison]]'s run on ''[[Animal Man]]'', imprisoned in [[Arkham Asylum]]. The effects of the electroshocks given to him by the renegade Thunderbolt have worn off and Hayden's memories of the ''Crisis'' and of the prior existence of multiple Earths are restored. Psycho Pirate ends up releasing characters destroyed during the ''Crisis'' back into the world. Many of these characters later come to realize they are just characters in a comic book. After an intervention by Animal Man, Hayden, seemingly happy, fades away into nothingness. Psycho Pirate's happiness is due to a relief of the strain from releasing all of the forgotten characters, but he is consequently removed from reality and placed back in [[Limbo (DC Comics)|Limbo]]. James Highwater, one of the Asylum staff, is left to wear the Medusa Mask and keep the forgotten Earths contained. The other staff members come to accept Highwater as a patient, not realizing his knowledge of the missing worlds.\n\nAt some point, the Medusa Mask is held by the [[Force of July]]. Abraham Lincoln Carlyle, who shelters the Force, claims to have gotten the mask from Hayden and to have learned how to use it by watching him. He tries to use the mask, unsuccessfully, against [[Shade, the Changing Man]] as his team falls under attack from the [[Suicide Squad]], however his heart fails him and Carlyle dies.<ref>''Suicide Squad'' #27, 1989</ref>\n\nPsycho-Pirate does not appear again until 1995 when he became part of the ''[[Underworld Unleashed]]'' crossover event. In this story Psycho-Pirate, along with several other villians, sells his soul to the demon [[Neron (DC Comics)|Neron]] in exchange for more power. The process results in a costume change for the character as well, with Hayden now wearing a black leather jacket and with the metal of his mask morphing into an eyepatch and replacing about half of his brain. Once again sane, and making no allusion to the events of ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'' and the existence of the Multiverse, Psycho-Pirate goes on to fight the Chase Lawler version of [[Manhunter (comics)#Chase Lawler|Manhunter]] before being arrested and sent to jail.\n\nAfter his appearance in the ''Fate'' series, Psycho-Pirate makes two brief appearances during the ''Joker: Last Laugh'' crossover event. He is first seen locked up in the maximum security prison called the \"Slab\". Psycho Pirate is again insane and rambling of the existence of the Multiverse and is seen in his original costume. All but one eye of the Pirate's face is covered and his eyebrows have been shaved off to reduce his ability to express emotion. The [[Joker (character)|Joker]] initiates a breakout and infection of the inmates, causing them to follow his orders and commit dangerous pranks. Psycho Pirate is seen shouting \"Fire!\" in a crowded theatre during the breakout.\n\n====''Infinite Crisis''====\n{{Main|Infinite Crisis}}\nPsycho-Pirate reappears in the ''JSA Classified'' #1\u20134 story arc, in which he reveals that he and Power Girl are refugees from Earth-Two. Along with several other individuals (such as [[Donna Troy]] and her evil alter ego Dark Angel), both Psycho Pirate and Power Girl were \"missed\" in the restructuring of the Multiverse into a single universe following the events of ''Crisis on Infinite Earths.'' This revelation restores the original origin story of Power Girl as well.\n[[File:Deathpp.PNG|200px|left|Psycho-Pirate's death at the hands of [[Black Adam]]. Art by [[Phil Jimenez]].|thumb]]\nPsycho-Pirate hopes to weaken Power Girl mentally so that she can be captured as part of [[Alexander Luthor, Jr.]]'s plot to unite and control characters who had originally been from universes destroyed during ''Crisis on Infinite Earths''. Failing at this, Psycho-Pirate flees and vows to make Power Girl his love slave once Luthor is finished with her.\n\nWhen [[Dick Grayson|Nightwing]], [[Superboy (Kon-El)|Superboy]], and [[Wonder Girl]] attack Luthor's base, they free all the captive heroes, including Power Girl and [[Black Adam]], who are then confronted by the Psycho-Pirate. Black Adam proceeds to gouge out the Psycho-Pirate's eyes and pushes the Medusa Mask through his head, killing him.\n\nPsycho-Pirate is mentioned in ''Justice League of America'' #1 as selling emotional states, such as \"happy\" and \"ecstatic\", much like a drug dealer. Among his reported clients are [[Signalman (comics)|Signalman]] and Silver Ghost. Psycho-Pirate's Medusa Mask is also featured in the 2008 ''[[Raven (DC Comics)|Raven]]'' miniseries. In the story's conclusion, Raven destroyed the mask but its power still affected scientists who studied its schematics on a computer.\n\n===''Blackest Night''===\nIn the ''[[Blackest Night]]'' storyline, Psycho-Pirate has been identified as one of the deceased who are entombed below the [[Hall of Justice (comics)|Hall of Justice]].<ref>''Blackest Night'' #1 (July 2009)</ref> Psycho-Pirate's corpse is revived as a [[Black Lantern Corps|Black Lantern]] during the event.<ref>''Blackest Night'' #3 (September 2009)</ref> He attacks Smallville, using his powers to manipulate the inhabitants and sway [[Superboy (Kon-El)|Conner Kent]] into attacking Superman.

Clark and Conner decide to separate, with Conner confronting Psycho-Pirate. Conner manages to withstand his emotional manipulation attempts and steals the Medusa Mask, which has been reconstructed via the black ring. Using the artifact, Conner inspires hope, will, and compassion, ending the riots in Smallville. Psycho-Pirate is last seen retreating into a dark alley, followed by Conner. Conner then uses the Medusa Mask on Kal-L, causing the black rings to malfunction and turning both Psycho-Pirate and Kal-L back into inanimate corpses.<ref>''Blackest Night: Superman'' #3 (2009)</ref>\n\n===''The New 52''===\nIn September 2011, ''[[The New 52]]'' rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, a new Psycho-Pirate first appears in ''Superboy'' Vol. 6 #23 as a member of the Twenty, a group of people who are infected by [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac]] with a psionic virus, thus giving them all psionic abilities. He was captured by the [[H.I.V.E.]] Queen, another member of the Twenty who had become a zealous devotee of Brainiac. He managed to escape and sought out the Medusa Mask, an artifact that he believed would protect him against other people with psychic powers. He then spent the next four years hiding other psychics from H.I.V.E. who were using the people they captured to power their operations in [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]].<ref>''Action Comics'' Vol. 3 #24</ref>\n\nDuring the Psi-War storyline, the Psycho-Pirate appears and takes out [[Hector Hammond]] and the H.I.V.E. Queen, who were both fighting for control of the city. When [[Superman]] arrives at H.I.V.E.'s headquarters, Hayden confronts him and drains his mind too. He is then surprised by [[Lois Lane]], who was infected with the same psionic virus by Senator Hume, yet another member of the Twenty. The two fight, with Hayden getting the upper hand. He then proceeds to make Metropolis' citizens act on pure emotion, creating riots and chaos throughout the streets. A recovered Superman, Lois Lane, Hector Hammond, and the H.I.V.E. Queen then team up to fight the Pirate and a fierce battle ensues, during which the Queen and Hammond are beaten. Superman manages to pull the Medusa Mask off of Hayden's face and incinerates it with his heat vision, defeating the Psycho-Pirate. However, he disappears in the aftermath of the battle.<ref>''Superman'' Vol. 3 #23-24</ref>\n\nAt the same time as he was clashing with Superman, Roger Hayden also sent an astral projection to confront [[Superboy]] and [[Doctor Psycho]] who are in [[New York City]] looking for a psychic called Shift. He reveals that Psycho was only manipulating Superboy to get his power. A three-way battle ensues between the three characters, which ends with Doctor Psycho being defeated and Superboy falling unconscious, only to wake up in a cell powerless.<ref>''Superboy'' Vol. 6 #23-24</ref>\n\n===''DC Rebirth''===\nPsycho-Pirate and [[Hugo Strange]] are sent to [[Gotham City|Gotham]] as part of [[Amanda Waller]]'s [[Task Force X]]. As soon as they arrive, Hugo Strange deviates from their mission and uses Psycho-Pirate to infect Gotham City's newest heroes, Gotham and Gotham Girl, with overwhelming rage and fear, respectively, causing Gotham to go on a murderous rampage. With this accomplished, Strange trades the Psycho-Pirate to [[Bane (DC Comics)|Bane]], who wants the Pirate to help him overcome the horrors of his childhood and his addiction to Venom. When [[Batman]] learns of this, he forms his own Suicide Squad with the [[Bronze Tiger]], the [[Ventriloquist (comics)|Ventriloquist]], [[Catwoman]], and [[Punch and Jewelee]]. Together, they infiltrate Bane's prison fortress on the island of [[Santa Prisca (DC Comics)|Santa Prisca]] and retrieve the Psycho-Pirate. Batman returns the Pirate to Gotham City and uses him to reverse the emotional damage that he did to Gotham Girl.<ref>''Batman'' (2016-) Vol. #1-3</ref>\n\nThe Medusa Mask is taken into Batman's custody. When Batman accidentally puts the blood-stained smiley face button from the corpse of Edward Blake (the Comedian) left in Batman's Batcave by Dr. Manhattan, next to the Medusa Mask, both artifacts create an energy reaction that attracts the attention of the [[Eobard Thawne|Reverse Flash (Eobard Thawne).]] The Reverse Flash is then killed by Dr. Manhattan, but not before the Medusa Mask manifests the erased-from-existence [[Flash (Jay Garrick)|Jay Garrick]]; who frantically attempts to warn Batman and Flash of Manhattan's evil scheme to alter the timeline so as to eliminate the Justice League and a create a darker, more cynical Superman, and a version of the Flashpoint Universe Thomas Wayne, who begs Batman to give up his costumed identity for a normal existence.<ref>''Batman'' #20-21 and ''Flash'' #20-21</ref>\n\nShortly after those events, Hayden has the Medusa Mask returned to him by agents of Bane. From there, it is revealed in the wake of the aborted Batman and Catwoman wedding that Hugo Strange, Psycho-Pirate and Gotham Girl were actually working together in secret with Bane, and that Psycho-Pirate has resurrected the ''Flashpoint'' Batman from the dead, to aid in Bane's scheme.\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nCharles Halstead has no superhuman powers; he is, however, a brilliant criminal mind with an excellent grasp of human psychology and emotions.\n\nWith the Medusa Mask, Roger Hayden is able to project emotions into people. Often, it seems to intensify emotions that a person already feels, no matter how small. Hayden later shows the power to manifest DC Multiverse characters that had been destroyed during the Crisis on Infinite Earths. This power expands to any Multiverse character, including the still-living. Psycho-Pirate has also shown some sort of regeneration of body control, as he is able to reform after being crushed by Power Girl, and also disguises himself as a Legion flight ring.\n\nDuring his '90s revamp, Psycho-Pirate was an \"psychic vampire\", able to drain emotions from people.\n\nFollowing the ''New 52'' reboot, Roger Hayden is depicted as a psychic who specializes in telepathically manipulating people's emotions. Examples include: calming a person to make them more reasonable or amplifying negative emotions such as fear or anger to the point of sending people into a murderous frenzy. While wearing the Medusa Mask, Hayden's emotion-manipulating powers were increased to the point where he could control all of Metropolis without straining himself. The mask also provided him with a number of other abilities, including shielding his mind against intrusion from other telepaths; levitation; draining other psi-powered individuals of their mental energies to increase his own; projecting psionic constructs in the form of giant orange snakes which he used to attack; forming a psychic link with another person; projecting his mind over tremendous distances, essentially granting him omnipresence; deflecting psionic attacks; projecting bolts of psionic energy; and creating illusions.\n\n==In other media==\n===Television===\n* In ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'', the Roger Hayden version of Psycho-Pirate makes a cameo appearance as a member of [[Gorilla Grodd]]'s [[Secret Society of Super Villains|Secret Society]]. He has no lines and takes no significant action in any episode. Notably, he is lacking the Medusa Mask.\n* The Roger Hayden incarnation of Psycho-Pirate appears in ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'', voiced by [[Armin Shimerman]]. In the episode \"Inside the Outsiders\", he is a sadist who kidnaps the group of teenage heroes known as the [[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]] ([[Black Lightning]], [[Katana (comics)|Katana]] and [[Metamorpho]]) and feeds off their rage caused by twisted nightmares. Batman goes inside their minds to save them, but Psycho-Pirate fakes his victory, almost causing Batman to feed him rage by pretending to kill the Outsiders. Batman realizes this, and thinks positive thoughts, starving the villain, and defeating him. Psycho-Pirate also made a cameo appearance in \"Mayhem of the Music Meister\" in the musical number \"Drives Us Bats\", as one of the patients at Arkham Asylum mesmerized into singing by the [[Music Meister]].\n* In the ''[[Constantine (TV series)|Constantine]]'' episode \"Blessed are the Damned\", the Medusa Mask is briefly seen among the artifacts stored in Jasper Winter's house.\n* In ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]'' episode \"Nora\", [[Nora West-Allen]] reveals a newspaper from 2049 to her father, [[Barry Allen (Arrowverse)|Barry Allen]] about his disappearance in 2024. The newspaper includes a quote from Roger Hayden a.k.a. Psycho-Pirate, who claims to remember the events of the Flash's final battle with the [[Eobard Thawne (Arrowverse)|Reverse-Flash]] and Flash's disappearance, who says, \"Worlds lived, worlds died. Nothing will ever be the same.\"\n* The Roger Hayden incarnation of Psycho-Pirate made his live action debut in the DCTV crossover \"[[Elseworlds (Arrowverse)|Elseworlds]]\", portrayed by [[Bob Frazer]].<ref name=\"Frazer\">{{cite web |url=https://ew.com/tv/2018/11/02/arrowverse-elseworlds-crossover-psycho-pirate/ |title=Arrowverse 'Elseworlds' crossover to feature DC villain Psycho-Pirate |last=Agard |first=Chancellor |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |date=November 2, 2018 |accessdate=November 2, 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20181102211618/https://ew.com/tv/2018/11/02/arrowverse-elseworlds-crossover-psycho-pirate/ |archivedate=November 2, 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref> In the second part of the crossover, Hayden is part of a group of inmates attempting to escape from [[Arkham Asylum]] after being released by [[Doctor Destiny|John Deegan]] before being stopped by [[Batwoman]]. In the final part, he reappears in his cell with his signature mask with a disfigured Deegan as his neighbor, cryptically quoting, \"Worlds will live, worlds will die and the universe [[Crisis on Infinite Earths|will never be the same]].\"\n\n===Video games===\n*The Roger Hayden version of Psycho-Pirate appears as a playable character in ''[[Lego DC Super-Villains]]'', with Armin Shimerman reprising the role from the ''Batman: The Brave and the Bold'' series.\n\n===Miscellaneous===\n* In the ''Justice League Adventures'' Issue #20 story \"Emotional Baggage\", Roger Hayden is a former psychiatrist (suspended for malpractice) whose wife and son died during an alien attack in Metropolis that the Justice League was involved in. He blames the League for this, displacing his own guilt. To exact revenge, he steals the Medusa Mask and becomes the Psycho-Pirate, first turning civilians against the League and then using the members' deeply hidden resentments to turn them against each other. By shape-shifting the emotion centers of his brain, Martian Manhunter frees himself and stops the Pirate's rampage by going into Hayden's memories of his family. Hayden is later seen in a straitjacket after this; doctors believe that the Medusa Mask has driven him insane. However, the \"horrors\" they say he is experiencing in his mind turn out to be him telling his wife and son that he loves them.\n* Psycho-Pirate appears as the primary antagonist of a special one-shot ''[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice]]'' issue published for [[Free Comic Book Day]]. He is shown working with [[Atomic Skull]] as part of a scheme to steal [[plutonium]] from a [[STAR Labs]] facility. Psycho-Pirate uses his Medusa Mask to force [[Superboy (Kon-El)|Superboy]], [[Miss Martian]], [[Aqualad (Jackson Hyde)|Aqualad]], [[Robin (Dick Grayson)|Robin]], and [[Kid Flash (Wally West)|Kid Flash]] to confront their inner demons, but is defeated and captured when Kid Flash breaks out of the illusion and removes the Medusa Mask from Psycho-Pirate's face.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.dialbforblog.com/archives/193 Fanpage about the Psycho-Pirate (both Halstead and Hayden)]\n{{Timeline\n|before= \u2190 The character Solomon Grundy was debuted by Alfred Bester and Paul Reinman.
