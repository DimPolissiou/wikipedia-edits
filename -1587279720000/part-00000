With the exception of two or three months in summer, this flat island is swept day and night by heavy winds that are sustained in winter. In summer, it can suffer the onslaught of cyclones and tropical storms.\n\nThere is only grass and brush (low shrubs) present on the island. Veloutaries (Heliotropium foertherianum) and purslane (Portulaca oleracea), with growth shaped by a dominant east winds are present everywhere on the island.\n\nThe fauna consists mainly of hermit crabs (Paguroidea), seabirds and sea turtles for which the island is an important nesting place. The green turtle (Chelonia mydas), also known as the freshwater turtle, is mainly encountered and, to a lesser extent, the tortoiseshell turtle, better known as the caret.\n\nThe waters are rich with fish. The French Coral Reef Initiative (IFRECOR) has identified 26 species of corals. Allochthonous species were introduced on the island during the various shipwrecks: rats, mice and rabbits. The latter were decimated in 1986 by cyclone Erinesta.\n\n===Important Bird Area===\nThe island has been identified as an [[Important Bird Area]] (IBA) by [[BirdLife International]] because of its significance as a [[bird colony|seabird breeding site]].  Both [[masked booby|masked]] (with up to 250 pairs) and [[red-footed booby|red-footed boobies]] (up to 180 pairs) nesting there.  [[Sulidae]] populations have seriously declined in the western Indian Ocean with those on Tromelin among the healthiest remaining.\n\nThe island's masked boobies are of the western Indian Ocean subspecies (''Sula dactylatra melanops''), of which Tromelin is a stronghold.<ref name=\"boobies\">{{cite book|title=African Wildlife|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-59LAQAAIAAJ|year=1974|publisher=Wildlife Society of Southern Africa.}}</ref> The red-footed boobies constitute the only polymorphic population in the region, indicating its biogeographical isolation.  Both [[great frigatebird|great]] and [[lesser frigatebird]]s used to nest on the island.

A navigation error, due to the use of two conflicting charts, caused the vessel to wreck on the reefs of Tromelin Island (then known as the Isle of Sand). The ship was a frigate, not a slave ship, and thus was not equipped with the shackles and chains usually found on slave ships.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Tromelin, l'\u00eele aux esclaves oubli\u00e9s|last=Gu\u00e9rout, Romon|first=Max, Thomas|publisher=CNRS Editions|year=2015|isbn=|location=France|pages=}}</ref>\n\nAfter the wreck, the crew and about 60 Malagasy people managed to reach the island, but the rest of the slaves, locked in the hold, drowned.

When the crew of the ship reached Mauritius, they requested that colonial authorities send a ship to rescue the Malagasy slaves on the island.

A boat was sent, but this first rescue failed, as the ship couldn't approach the island. A year later, a second ship, ''La Sauterelle'', also failed to reach the island. During this second failed rescue, a sailor managed to swim to the island, but he had to be abandoned by the ship due to bad weather. This sailor remained on Tromelin Island and, some time later, probably around 1775, built a raft on which he embarked with three men and three women, but which disappeared at sea.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIt was not until 29 November 1776, 15 years after the sinking, that the [[:fr:Bernard Boudin de Tromelin|Chevalier de Tromelin]], commander of the corvette ''La Dauphine'', reached Tromelin Island and rescued the survivors\u2014seven women and an eight-month-old child.<ref name=\"Marriner-2\">{{cite journal|last=Marriner |first=Nick |last2=Gu\u00e9rout|first2=Max |last3=Romon |first3=Thomas |year=2010 |title=The Forgotten Slaves of Tromelin (Indian Ocean): New Geoarchaeological Data|journal=Journal of Archaeological Science|volume=37|issue=6|pages=1293\u20131304|doi=10.1016/j.jas.2009.12.032}}</ref><ref name=\"independent\" />  Upon arriving there, the Chevalier de Tromelin discovered that the survivors were dressed in plaited feather clothes and that they had managed, during all these years, to keep a fire lit (the island does not have a single tree). The Malagasy people, who had been left on the bleak little island, built a shed with coral stones, for most of the wood had been used in the construction of the raft for the crew. They also built a lookout on the highest point of the island in order not to miss the ship that would, they hoped, come to their rescue. They were all from the [[Central Highlands (Madagascar)|Central Highlands]] of Madagascar, and had no knowledge of how to produce food in the coastal environment.

The results of the research were made public on January 17, 2007.

Basements made of beach sandstone and coral were also found (the survivors thus transgressed a Malagasy custom according to which  stone constructions were reserved for tombs).

The fire was maintained for fifteen years, thanks to the wood from the wreck, the island being devoid of trees.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nA second expedition, organized in November 2008, did not reveal the burials observed in 1851 by an English naval officer. However, the remains of two bodies displaced during the digging of the foundations of a building of the weather station have been uncovered. Three buildings built with coral blocks have been discovered, including the kitchen, which was still equipped with kitchen utensils, and in particular copper containers that had been repaired several times, testifying to the slaves' determination to survive.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nA third archaeological mission took place in November 2010.

With the exception of two or three months in summer, this flat island is swept day and night by heavy winds that are sustained in winter. In summer, it can suffer the onslaught of cyclones and tropical storms.\n\nThere is only grass and brush (low shrubs) present on the island. Veloutaries (Heliotropium foertherianum) and purslane (Portulaca oleracea), with growth shaped by a dominant east winds are present everywhere on the island.\n\nThe fauna consists mainly of hermit crabs (Paguroidea), seabirds and sea turtles for which the island is an important nesting place. The green turtle (Chelonia mydas), also known as the freshwater turtle, is mainly encountered and, to a lesser extent, the tortoiseshell turtle, better known as the caret.\n\nThe waters are rich with fish. The French Coral Reef Initiative (IFRECOR) has identified 26 species of corals. Allochthonous species were introduced on the island during the various shipwrecks: rats, mice and rabbits. The latter were decimated in 1986 by cyclone Erinesta.\n\n===Important Bird Area===\nThe island has been identified as an [[Important Bird Area]] (IBA) by [[BirdLife International]] because of its significance as a [[bird colony|seabird breeding site]].  Both [[masked booby|masked]] (with up to 250 pairs) and [[red-footed booby|red-footed boobies]] (up to 180 pairs) nesting there.  [[Sulidae]] populations have seriously declined in the western Indian Ocean with those on Tromelin among the healthiest remaining.\n\nThe island's masked boobies are of the western Indian Ocean subspecies (''Sula dactylatra melanops''), of which Tromelin is a stronghold.<ref name=\"boobies\">{{cite book|title=African Wildlife|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-59LAQAAIAAJ|year=1974|publisher=Wildlife Society of Southern Africa.}}</ref> The red-footed boobies constitute the only polymorphic population in the region, indicating its biogeographical isolation.  Both [[great frigatebird|great]] and [[lesser frigatebird]]s used to nest on the island.

A navigation error, due to the use of two conflicting charts, caused the vessel to wreck on the reefs of Tromelin Island (then known as the Isle of Sand). The ship was a frigate, not a slave ship, and thus was not equipped with the shackles and chains usually found on slave ships.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Tromelin, l'\u00eele aux esclaves oubli\u00e9s|last=Gu\u00e9rout, Romon|first=Max, Thomas|publisher=CNRS Editions|year=2015|isbn=|location=France|pages=}}</ref>\n\nAfter the wreck, the crew and about 60 Malagasy people managed to reach the island, but the rest of the slaves, locked in the hold, drowned.

A boat was sent, but this first rescue failed, as the ship couldn't approach the island. A year later, a second ship, ''La Sauterelle'', also failed to reach the island. During this second failed rescue, a sailor managed to swim to the island, but he had to be abandoned by the ship due to bad weather. This sailor remained on Tromelin Island and, some time later, probably around 1775, built a raft on which he embarked with three men and three women, but which disappeared at sea.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIt was not until 29 November 1776, 15 years after the sinking, that the [[:fr:Bernard Boudin de Tromelin|Chevalier de Tromelin]], commander of the corvette ''La Dauphine'', reached Tromelin Island and rescued the survivors\u2014seven women and an eight-month-old child.<ref name=\"Marriner-2\">{{cite journal|last=Marriner |first=Nick |last2=Gu\u00e9rout|first2=Max |last3=Romon |first3=Thomas |year=2010 |title=The Forgotten Slaves of Tromelin (Indian Ocean): New Geoarchaeological Data|journal=Journal of Archaeological Science|volume=37|issue=6|pages=1293\u20131304|doi=10.1016/j.jas.2009.12.032}}</ref><ref name=\"independent\" />  Upon arriving there, the Chevalier de Tromelin discovered that the survivors were dressed in plaited feather clothes and that they had managed, during all these years, to keep a fire lit (the island does not have a single tree).

They also built a lookout on the highest point of the island in order not to miss the ship that would, they hoped, come to their rescue.

The Chevalier de Tromelin was the first to precisely describe the island that now bears his name.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe [[Marquis de Condorcet]], advocating the abolition of slavery in his book ''Reflections on the Slavery of Negroes'' published in 1781, recounted the tragedy of the castaways of Tromelin to illustrate the inhumanity of the slave trade.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Expedition \"Forgotten slaves\" ===\nAn archeological expedition entitled \"Forgotten Slaves\", led by Max Gu\u00e9rout, a former French naval officer and director of operations of the Naval Archeology Research Group, and Thomas Romon, archaeologist at INRAP (National Institute for Preventive Archaeological Research), took place from October to November 2006, under the patronage of UNESCO and the French Committee for the History and Remembrance of Slavery (CPMHE). The results of the research were made public on January 17, 2007. The ten members of the expedition probed the wreck of L'Utile, and searched the island for traces of shipwreck, in order to better understand the living conditions of the Malagasy people during these fifteen years.<ref name=\":0\" />\nAccording to Max Gu\u00e9rout, head of the mission, \"In three days, a well 5 meters deep was dug. This represented a considerable effort. We found many bones of birds, turtles, and fish.\" One does not have the impression that these people were crushed by their condition. They tried to survive with order and method.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAn anonymous logbook, attributed to a writer of the crew, was found. Basements made of beach sandstone and coral were also found (the survivors thus transgressed a Malagasy custom according to which  stone constructions were reserved for tombs). There were also six copper bowls and a pebble used to sharpen knives. The fire was maintained for fifteen years, thanks to the wood from the wreck, the island being devoid of trees.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nA second expedition, organized in November 2008, did not reveal the burials observed in 1851 by an English naval officer. However, the remains of two bodies displaced during the digging of the foundations of a building of the weather station have been uncovered. Three buildings built with coral blocks have been discovered, including the kitchen, which was still equipped with kitchen utensils, and in particular copper containers that had been repaired several times, testifying to the slaves' determination to survive.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nA third archaeological mission took place in November 2010. It allowed the discovery of three new buildings and many objects, including two lighters and flints, which elucidated the technique used by the castaways to rekindle the fire.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe fourth expedition, took place in September / October 2013. It lasted for 45 days, and enabled to identify many tools, shelters and to understand the layout of the site.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn 2016, an exhibition presenting the results of the various excavation campaigns, entitled \"Tromelin, the island of forgotten slaves\", was presented jointly in metropolitan France and in the DROM: at the Stella Matutina museum in Saint-Leu (La R\u00e9union), the castle of the Dukes of Brittany in Nantes, the House of Agglomeration of Lorient, the Aquitaine Museum in Bordeaux, the departmental museum of archeology and prehistory of Martinique in Fort-de-France, and finally to the Basque Museum of the History of Bayonne from June to November 2017.\n\n===Sovereignty claims===\nThe French claim to sovereignty dates from 29 November 1776,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.taaf.fr/spip/spip.php?article314|title=''Ce n\u2019est que quinze ans plus tard, le 29 novembre 1776, que le chevalier de Tromelin r\u00e9cup\u00e9rera huit esclaves survivants : sept femmes et un enfant de huit mois.
