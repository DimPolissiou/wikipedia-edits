The amendment was proposed by Congress to the states on August 27, 1962, and was [[ratified]] by the states on January 23, 1964.\n\n[[Southern United States|Southern states]] of the former [[Confederate States of America]] adopted [[Poll taxes in the United States|poll taxes]] in laws of the late 19th century and new constitutions from 1890 to 1908, after the Democratic Party had generally regained control of state legislatures decades after the end of [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]], as a measure to prevent [[African Americans]] and often poor whites from voting. Use of the poll taxes by states was held to be constitutional by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] in the 1937 decision ''[[Breedlove v.

The amendment prohibited requiring a poll tax for voters in federal elections. But it was not until 1966 that the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 6\u20133 in ''[[Harper v.

This required that voting not be limited by \"race, color, or previous condition of servitude.\" All voters were required to pay the poll tax, but in practice it most affected the poor. Notably this affected both African Americans and poor white voters, some of whom had voted with [[People's Party (United States)|Populist]] and [[Fusion Party|Fusionist]] candidates in the late 19th century, temporarily disturbing Democratic rule. Proponents of the poll tax downplayed this aspect and assured white voters they would not be affected. Passage of poll taxes began in earnest in the 1890s, as Democrats wanted to prevent another Populist-Republican coalition. Despite election violence and fraud, African Americans were still winning numerous local seats. By 1902, all eleven states of the former [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] had enacted a poll tax, many within new constitutions that contained other provisions as barriers to voter registration, such as literacy or comprehension tests administered subjectively by white  workers. The poll tax was used together with other devices such as [[grandfather clause]]s and the \"[[white primary]]\" designed to exclude blacks, as well as threats and acts of violence. For example, potential voters had to be \"assessed\" in Arkansas, and blacks were utterly ignored in the assessment.{{sfn|Ogden|1958|pp=4\u201313, 170\u2013231}}\n\nFrom 1900 to 1937, such use of the poll tax was nearly ignored by the federal government. Several state-level initiatives repealed poll taxes during this period for two reasons: firstly that they encouraged corruption since wealthy persons could and would pay other people's poll taxes;<ref>Kneebone, John T.; ''Southern Liberal Journalists and the Issue of Race, 1920\u20131944'' p. 142 {{ISBN|0807816604}}</ref><ref>Sullivan, Patricia; ''Days of Hope: Race and Democracy in the New Deal Era'', p. 107 {{ISBN|0807822604}}</ref> secondly, because they discouraged white voting more than many populist Southern politicians desired. The poll tax survived a legal challenge in the 1937 Supreme Court case ''[[Breedlove v. Suttles]]'', which unanimously ruled that\n\n{{quote|[The] privilege of voting is not derived from the United States, but is conferred by the state and, save as restrained by the Fifteenth and Nineteenth Amendments and other provisions of the Federal Constitution, the state may condition suffrage as it deems appropriate.<ref>[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&vol=302&invol=277 ''Breedlove v. Suttles''], majority opinion.</ref>}}\n\nThe issue remained prominent, as most African Americans in the South were disenfranchised. President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] spoke out against the tax.  He publicly called it \"a remnant of the Revolutionary period\" that the country had moved past. However, Roosevelt's favored liberal Democrats in the South lost in the 1938 primaries to the reigning conservative Southern Democrats, and he backed off the issue. He felt that he needed Southern Democratic votes to pass [[New Deal]] programs and did not want to further antagonize them.{{sfn|Lawson|1976|p=57}} Still, efforts at the Congressional level to abolish the poll tax continued. A 1939 bill to abolish the poll tax in federal elections was tied up by the Southern Block, lawmakers whose long tenure in office from a one-party region gave them seniority and command of numerous important committee chairmanships. A [[discharge petition]] was able to force the bill to be considered, and the House passed the bill 254\u201384.{{sfn|Lawson|1976|page=68}} However, the bill was unable to defeat a [[filibuster]] in the Senate by Southern senators and a few Northern allies who valued the support of the powerful and senior Southern seats. This bill would be re-proposed in the next several Congresses. It came closest to passage during World War II, when opponents framed abolition as a means to help overseas soldiers vote. However, after learning that the US Supreme Court decision ''[[Smith v. Allwright]]'' (1944) banned use of the \"[[white primary]],\" the Southern block refused to approve abolition of the poll tax.{{sfn|Lawson|1976|p=74}}\n\nIn 1946, the Senate came close to passing the bill. 24 Democrats and 15 Republicans approved an end to debate, while 7 non-southern Democrats and 7 Republicans joined with the 19 Southern Democrats in opposition. The result was a 39\u201333 vote in favor of the bill, but the filibuster required a two-thirds supermajority to break at the time; a 48\u201324 vote was required to pass the bill.{{clarify|date=February 2011|reason=That's two thirds; and why are there only 72 senators?

Southern politicians tried to shift the debate to Constitutional issue, but private correspondence indicates that black disenfranchisement was still the true concern. For instance, Mississippi Senator [[Theodore Bilbo]] declared, \"If the poll tax bill passes, the next step will be an effort to remove the registration qualification, the educational qualification of Negroes. If that is done we will have no way of preventing the Negroes from voting.\"{{sfn|Lawson|1976|p=70}} This fear explains why even Southern Senators from states that had abolished the poll tax still opposed the bill; they did not want to set a precedent that the federal government could interfere in state elections.\n\nPresident [[Harry S. Truman]] established the [[President's Committee on Civil Rights]], which among other issues investigated the poll tax. Considering that opposition to federal poll tax regulation in 1948 was claimed as based on the Constitution, the Committee noted that a constitutional amendment might be the best way to proceed. Still, little occurred during the 1950s. Members of the anti-poll tax movement laid low during the anti-Communist frenzy of the period; some of the main proponents of poll tax abolition, such as [[Joseph Gelders]] and [[Vito Marcantonio]], had been committed [[Marxist]]s.{{sfn|Lawson|1976|p=82}}\n\nPresident [[John F. Kennedy]] returned to this issue. His administration urged Congress to adopt and send such an amendment to the states for ratification. He considered the constitutional amendment the best way to avoid a filibuster, as the claim that federal abolition of the poll tax was unconstitutional would be moot. Still, some liberals opposed Kennedy's action, feeling that an amendment would be too slow compared to legislation.{{sfn|Lawson|1976|p=290}} [[Spessard Holland]], a conservative Democrat from Florida, introduced the amendment to the Senate.

Ratification of the amendment was relatively quick, taking slightly more than a year; it was rapidly ratified by state legislatures across the country from August 1962 to January 1964.\n\n[[Lyndon B. Johnson|President Lyndon B. Johnson]] called the amendment a \"triumph of liberty over restriction\" and \"a verification of people's rights.\"<ref name=\"nytimes1964\" /> States that had maintained the poll tax were more reserved.  Mississippi's Attorney General, [[Joe Patterson]], complained about the complexity of two sets of voters \u2013 those who paid their poll tax and could vote in all elections, and those who had not and could only vote only in federal elections.<ref name=\"nytimes1964\" /> Additionally, non-payers of the poll tax could still be deterred by such requirements as having to register far in advance of the election and retain records of such registration.<ref name=\"milwaukeejournal\" /> States such as Alabama also continued to exercise discrimination in the application of [[literacy test]]s.\n\n==Proposal and ratification==\n:''See also: {{Slink|Presidency of John F.

Ratification of the amendment was relatively quick, taking slightly more than a year; it was rapidly ratified by state legislatures across the country from August 1962 to January 1964.\n\n[[Lyndon B.

These were struck down in 1966 by the US Supreme Court decision in ''[[Harper v. Virginia Board of Elections]]'' (1966), which ruled poll taxes unconstitutional even for state elections. Federal district courts in [[Alabama]] and [[Texas]], respectively, struck down these states' poll taxes less than two months before the ''Harper'' ruling was issued.\n\nThe state of [[Virginia]] accommodated the amendment by providing an \"escape clause\" to the poll tax. In lieu of paying the poll tax, a prospective voter could file paperwork to gain a certificate establishing a place of residence in Virginia.  The papers would have to be filed six months in advance of voting, and the voter had to provide a copy of that certificate at the time of voting. This measure was expected to decrease the number of legal voters.<ref name=\"chadwick\">Chadwick, John.

It declared that for federal elections, \"the poll tax is abolished absolutely as a prerequisite to voting, and no equivalent or milder substitute may be imposed.\"<ref>[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&vol=380&invol=528 ''Harman v.

The ''Harper'' decision relied upon the [[Equal Protection Clause]] of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]], rather than the Twenty-Fourth Amendment. As such, issues related to whether burdens on voting are equivalent to poll taxes in discriminatory effect have usually been litigated on Equal Protection grounds since.\n\n==See also==\n* [[2018 Florida Amendment 4]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n* {{cite book|last1=Lawson|first1=Steven F.|title=Black Ballots: Voting Rights in the South, 1944\u20131969|url=https://archive.org/details/blackballotsvoti0000laws|url-access=registration|year=1976|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last1=Ogden|first1=Frederic D.|title=The Poll Tax in the South|url=https://archive.org/details/polltaxinsouth00ogde|url-access=registration|year=1958|publisher=University of Alabama Press|ref=harv}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Twenty-fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution}}\n* [https://www.law.cornell.edu/anncon/html/amdt24toc_user.html CRS Annotated Constitution: 24th Amendment]\n\n{{US Constitution}}\n{{Voting rights in the United States}}\n{{Civil rights movement}}\n{{Suffrage}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:24}}\n[[Category:1964 in American politics]]\n[[Category:1964 in American law|Twenty-fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution]]\n[[Category:Amendments to the United States Constitution]]\n[[Category:History of taxation in the United States]]\n[[Category:History of the United States (1945\u20131964)]]\n[[Category:History of voting rights in the United States]]\n[[Category:1962 in American law]]\n[[Category:1962 in American politics]]\n", "name_user": "Paul2520", "label": "safe", "comment": "perCategory:CS1 maint: ref=harv(viaWP:JWB)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty-fourth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution"}

The [[Iberians|Iberian]]s are believed to have arrived or emerged in the region as a culture between the [[4th millennium BC]] and the 3rd millennium BC, settling initially along the Mediterranean coast.\n\n[[Celts]] settled in Spain during the [[Iron Age Europe|Iron Age]]. Some of those tribes in North-central Spain, who had cultural contact with the Iberians, are called [[Celtiberians]]. In addition, a group known as the [[Tartessos|Tartessians]] and later [[Turdetani]]ans inhabited southwestern Spain. They are believed to have developed a separate culture influenced by [[Phoenicia]]. The seafaring Phoenicians, [[Greeks]], and [[Carthaginian Republic|Carthaginians]] successively founded trading colonies along the Mediterranean coast over a period of several centuries. Interaction took place with indigenous peoples. The [[Second Punic War]] between the Carthaginians and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] was fought mainly in what is now Spain and [[Portugal]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arqueotavira.com/Mapas/Iberia/Populi.htm |title=Ethnographic map of Pre-Roman Iberia |website=Lu\u00eds Fraga da Silva \u2013 Associa\u00e7\u00e3o Campo Arqueol\u00f3gico de Tavira, Tavira, Portugal |access-date=25 April 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040611215344/http://www.arqueotavira.com/Mapas/Iberia/Populi.htm |archivedate=11 June 2004}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Roman Republic]] conquered Iberia during the 2nd and 1st centuries BC, and established a series of [[Latin]]-speaking provinces in the region. As a result of [[Campaign history of the Roman military#Conquest of the Iberian peninsula (218-19 BC)|Roman colonization]], the majority of local languages, with the exception of [[Basque language|Basque]], stem from the [[Vulgar Latin]] that was spoken in [[Hispania]] (Roman Iberia). A new group of [[languages of Iberia|Romance languages of the Iberian Peninsula]] including [[Spanish language|Spanish]], which eventually became the main language in Spain evolved from Roman expansion. Hispania emerged as an important part of the [[Roman Empire]] and produced notable historical figures such as [[Trajan]], [[Hadrian]], [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] and [[Quintilian]].\n\nThe [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] [[Vandals]] and [[Suebi]], with [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] [[Alans]] under King [[Respendial]], arrived in the peninsula in 409 AD. Part of the Vandals with the remaining Alans, now under [[Geiseric]], removed to North Africa after a few conflicts with another Germanic tribe, the [[Visigoths#Visigothic Kingdom in Iberia|Visigoths]]. The latter were established in [[Toulouse]] and supported Roman campaigns against the Vandals and Alans in 415\u201319 AD.\n\nThe Visigoths became the dominant power in Iberia and reigned for three centuries. They were highly [[Romanization (cultural)|romanized]] in the eastern Empire and already Christians, so they became fully integrated into the late Iberian-Roman culture. They accepted the laws and structures of the late Roman World with little change, more than any other successor barbarian state in the West after the [[Ostrogoths]]; in addition, they shifted away from [[Arianism]] in Christian thought.{{citation needed|date=April 2011}}\n\nThe [[Suebi]] were another Germanic tribe in the peninsula; some sources said that they became established as ''federates'' of the Roman Empire in the old Northwestern Roman province of [[Gallaecia]]. But they were largely independent and raided neighboring provinces to expand their political control over ever-larger portions of the southwest after the Vandals and Alans left. They created a totally independent [[Suebic Kingdom of Galicia|Suebic Kingdom]]. In 447 AC they converted to Roman Catholicism under King [[Rechila]].\n\nAfter being checked and reduced in 456 AD by the Visigoths, the Suebic Kingdom survived to 585 AD. It was decimated as an independent political unit by the Visigoths, after having been involved in the internal affairs of their kingdom. The Suebi had supported Catholic rebellions and sedition [[Hermenegild|within the Royal family]]{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}.\n\n===Middle Ages===\nAfter two centuries of domination by the [[Visigothic Kingdom]], the [[Iberian Peninsula]] was [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania|invaded by a Muslim force]] under Tariq Bin Ziyad in 711. This army consisted mainly ethnic [[Berbers]] from the Ghomara tribe, who were reinforced by [[Arabs]] from [[Syria]] once the conquest was complete. The Visigothic Kingdom totally collapsed and nearly the entire peninsula was conquered. A remote mountainous area in the far north retained independence, eventually developing as the Christian [[Kingdom of Asturias]].\n\nMuslim Iberia became part of the Umayyad Caliphate and would be known as [[Al-Andalus]]. The Berbers of Al Andalus revolted as early as 740 AD, halting Arab expansion across the [[Pyrenee Mountains]] into France. Upon the collapse of the [[Umayyad]] in [[Damascus]], Spain was seized by Yusuf al Fihri. The exiled Umayyad Prince Abd al-Rahman I next seized power, establishing himself as Emir of [[C\u00f3rdoba, Spain|Cordoba]]. [[Abd al Rahman III]], his grandson, proclaimed a [[Caliphate]] in 929, marking the beginning of the Golden Age of Al Andalus. This policy was the effective power of the peninsula and Western North Africa; it competed with the [[Shiite]] rulers of [[Tunis]] and frequently raided the small Christian kingdoms in the North.\n\nThe [[Caliphate of C\u00f3rdoba]] effectively collapsed during a ruinous civil war between 1009 and 1013; it was not finally abolished until 1031, when al-Andalus broke up into a number of mostly independent mini-states and principalities called ''[[taifas]].'' These were generally too weak to defend themselves against repeated raids and demands for tribute from the Christian states to the north and west, which were known to the Muslims as \"the Galician nations.\" These had expanded from their initial strongholds in Galicia, Asturias, Cantabria, the Basque country, and the Carolingian Marca Hispanica to become the Kingdoms of Navarre, Le\u00f3n, Portugal, Castile and Aragon, and the County of Barcelona. Eventually they began to conquer territory, and the Taifa kings asked for help from the Almoravids, Muslim Berber rulers of the [[Maghreb]]. But the [[Almoravids]] went on to conquer and annex all the Taifa kingdoms.\n\nIn 1086 the Almoravid ruler of Morocco, [[Yusuf ibn Tashfin]], was invited by the Muslim princes in Iberia to defend them against [[Alfonso VI]], King of Castile and Le\u00f3n. In that year, Tashfin crossed the straits to Algeciras and inflicted a severe defeat on the Christians at the [[Battle of Sagrajas]]. By 1094, Yusuf ibn Tashfin had removed all Muslim princes in Iberia and had annexed their states, except for the one at Zaragoza. He also regained [[Valencia]] from the Christians. About this time a massive process of conversion to [[Islam]] took place, and Muslims comprised the majority of the population in Spain by the end of the 11th century.\n\nThe Almoravids were succeeded by the Almohads, another Berber dynasty, after the victory of Abu Yusuf Ya'qub al-Mansur over the Castilian Alfonso VIII at the Battle of Alarcos in 1195. In 1212 a coalition of Christian kings under the leadership of the Castilian Alfonso VIII defeated the Almohads at the Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa. But the Almohads continued to rule Al-Andalus for another decade, though with much reduced power and prestige. The civil wars following the death of Abu Ya'qub Yusuf II rapidly led to the re-establishment of taifas. The taifas, newly independent but weakened, were quickly conquered by the kingdoms of Portugal, Castile, and Aragon. After the fall of Murcia (1243) and the Algarve (1249), only the [[Emirate of Granada]] survived as a Muslim state, tributary of Castile until 1492.\n\nIn 1469 the marriage of Ferdinand of Aragon and Isabella of Castile signaled a joining of forces to attack and conquer the Emirate of Granada. The King and Queen convinced the [[Pope]] to declare their war a [[Crusades|crusade]]. The Christians were successful and finally, in January 1492, after a long siege, the Moorish sultan [[Muhammad XII]] surrendered the fortress palace, the renowned [[Alhambra]].\n\nSpain conquered the [[Canary Islands]] between 1402 and 1496. Their indigenous Berber populations, the [[Guanches]], were gradually absorbed by unions with Spanish settlers.\n\nSpanish conquest of the Iberian part of Navarre was begun by Ferdinand II of Aragon and completed by Charles V. The series of military campaigns extended from 1512 to 1524, while the war lasted until 1528 in the Navarre to the north of the Pyrenees. Between 1568-1571, Charles V armies fought and defeated a general insurrection of the Muslims of the mountains of Granada. Charles V then ordered the expulsion of up to 80,000 Granadans from the province and their dispersal throughout Spain.\n\nThe union of the Christian kingdoms of Castile and Aragon as well as the conquest of [[Granada]], Navarre and the Canary Islands led to the formation of the Spanish state as known today. This allowed for the development of a Spanish identity based on the Spanish language and a local form of Catholicism. This gradually developed in a territory that remained culturally, linguistically and religiously very diverse.\n\nA majority of Jews were forcibly [[Converso|converted to Catholicism]] during the 14th and 15th centuries and those remaining were expelled from Spain in 1492. The open practice of Islam by Spain's sizeable [[Mudejar]] population was similarly outlawed. Furthermore, between 1609 and 1614, a significant number of [[Morisco]]s\u2014 (Muslims who had been baptized Catholic) were [[expulsion of the Moriscos|expelled]] by royal decree.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/392401/Morisco |title=Morisco \u2013 Britannica Online Encyclopedia |publisher=Britannica.com |accessdate=24 February 2014}}</ref> Although initial estimates of the number of Moriscos expelled such as those of Henri Lapeyre reach 300,000 moriscos (or 4% of the total Spanish population), the extent and severity of the expulsion has been increasingly challenged by modern historians.

Spanish is the official state language, although the other languages are co-official in a number of autonomous communities.\n\nPeninsular Spanish is typically classified in northern and southern dialects; among the southern ones [[Andalusian Spanish]] is particularly important. The Canary Islands have a [[Canarian Spanish|distinct dialect]] of Spanish which is close to [[Caribbean Spanish]]. The Spanish language is a [[Romance languages|Romance language]] and is one of the aspects (including laws and general \"ways of life\") that causes Spaniards to be labelled a [[Romance-speaking Europe|Latin people]]. Spanish has a significant [[Arabic influence on the Spanish language|Arabic influence]] in vocabulary; between the 8th and 12th centuries, Arabic was the dominant language in [[Al-Andalus]]<ref>[http://teachmideast.org/articles/arabic-contributions-to-the-spanish-language-and-culture/ Arabic Contributions to the Spanish Language and Culture]</ref> and nearly 4,000 words are of Arabic origin, including nouns, verbs and adjectives.<ref>[http://linguistics.byu.edu/classes/ling450ch/reports/spanish.html \"The History of the Spanish Language\"] - The importance of this influence can be seen in words such as admiral (almirante), algebra, alchemy and alcohol, to note just a few obvious examples, which entered other European languages, like French, English, German, from Arabic via medieval Spanish. Modern Spanish has [http://anthro.palomar.edu/language/language_1.htm <!--\"Language and Culture: Introduction\"--> around 100,000 words].</ref> It also has influences from other [[Romance languages]] such as [[French language|French]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Catalan language|Catalan]], [[Galician language|Galician]] or [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]. Traditionally, the [[Basque language]] has been considered a key influence on Spanish, though nowadays this is questioned. Other changes are borrowings from English and other Germanic languages, although English influence is stronger in Latin America than in Spain.\n\nThe number of speakers of [[Names given to the Spanish language|Spanish]] as a mother tongue is roughly 35.6 million, while the vast majority of other groups in Spain such as the [[Galician people|Galicians]], [[Catalan people|Catalans]], and [[Basque people|Basques]] also speak Spanish as a first or second language, which boosts the number of Spanish speakers to the overwhelming majority of Spain's population of 46 million.\n\nSpanish was exported to the Americas due to over three centuries of Spanish colonial rule starting with the arrival of [[Christopher Columbus]] to [[Santo Domingo]] in 1492. Spanish is spoken natively by over 400 million people and spans across most countries of the Americas; from the Southwestern United States in North America down to [[Tierra del Fuego]], the southernmost region of South America in [[Chile]] and [[Argentina]]. A variety of the language, known as [[Judaeo-Spanish]] or Ladino (or [[Haketia]] in Morocco), is still spoken by descendants of Sephardim (Spanish and Portuguese Jews) who fled Spain following a [[Alhambra Decree|decree of expulsion of practising Jews]] in 1492. Also, a Spanish [[creole language]] known as [[Chabacano language|Chabacano]], which developed by the mixing of Spanish and native [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] and [[Cebuano language]]s during Spain's rule of the country through [[Mexico]] from 1565 to 1898, is spoken in the [[Philippines]] (by roughly 1 million people).<ref>{{cite book | url=https://www.ethnologue.com/language/cbk | title=Ethnologue: Languages of the World | publisher=SIL International | date=2016 | editor-last=Fennig |editor-first=Charles D. | place =Dallas, Texas |edition=Nineteenth | accessdate=26 January 2017 }}</ref>\n\n==Religion==\n{{Pie chart\n|thumb = right\n|caption= Religious in Spain (2019)<ref name=\"CIA\" />\n|label1 = [[Catholic Church in Spain|Catholic Christianity]]\n|value1 = 68.9\n|color1 = Indigo\n|label2 = No Religion\n|value2 = 27.1\n|color2 = White\n|label3 = Other \n|value3 = 2.8\n|color3 = Orange\n|label4 = Unspecified \n|value4 = 1.1\n|color4 = Black\n}}\n{{Main|Religion in Spain}}\n[[Roman Catholicism in Spain|Roman Catholicism]] is by far the largest denomination present in [[Spain]] although its share of the population has been decreasing for decades.

The [[Iberians|Iberian]]s are believed to have arrived or emerged in the region as a culture between the [[4th millennium BC]] and the 3rd millennium BC, settling initially along the Mediterranean coast.\n\n[[Celts]] settled in Spain during the [[Iron Age Europe|Iron Age]]. Some of those tribes in North-central Spain, who had cultural contact with the Iberians, are called [[Celtiberians]]. In addition, a group known as the [[Tartessos|Tartessians]] and later [[Turdetani]]ans inhabited southwestern Spain. They are believed to have developed a separate culture influenced by [[Phoenicia]]. The seafaring Phoenicians, [[Greeks]], and [[Carthaginian Republic|Carthaginians]] successively founded trading colonies along the Mediterranean coast over a period of several centuries. Interaction took place with indigenous peoples. The [[Second Punic War]] between the Carthaginians and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] was fought mainly in what is now Spain and [[Portugal]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arqueotavira.com/Mapas/Iberia/Populi.htm |title=Ethnographic map of Pre-Roman Iberia |website=Lu\u00eds Fraga da Silva \u2013 Associa\u00e7\u00e3o Campo Arqueol\u00f3gico de Tavira, Tavira, Portugal |access-date=25 April 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040611215344/http://www.arqueotavira.com/Mapas/Iberia/Populi.htm |archivedate=11 June 2004}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Roman Republic]] conquered Iberia during the 2nd and 1st centuries BC, and established a series of [[Latin]]-speaking provinces in the region. As a result of [[Campaign history of the Roman military#Conquest of the Iberian peninsula (218-19 BC)|Roman colonization]], the majority of local languages, with the exception of [[Basque language|Basque]], stem from the [[Vulgar Latin]] that was spoken in [[Hispania]] (Roman Iberia). A new group of [[languages of Iberia|Romance languages of the Iberian Peninsula]] including [[Spanish language|Spanish]], which eventually became the main language in Spain evolved from Roman expansion. Hispania emerged as an important part of the [[Roman Empire]] and produced notable historical figures such as [[Trajan]], [[Hadrian]], [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] and [[Quintilian]].\n\nThe [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] [[Vandals]] and [[Suebi]], with [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] [[Alans]] under King [[Respendial]], arrived in the peninsula in 409 AD. Part of the Vandals with the remaining Alans, now under [[Geiseric]], removed to North Africa after a few conflicts with another Germanic tribe, the [[Visigoths#Visigothic Kingdom in Iberia|Visigoths]]. The latter were established in [[Toulouse]] and supported Roman campaigns against the Vandals and Alans in 415\u201319 AD.\n\nThe Visigoths became the dominant power in Iberia and reigned for three centuries. They were highly [[Romanization (cultural)|romanized]] in the eastern Empire and already Christians, so they became fully integrated into the late Iberian-Roman culture. They accepted the laws and structures of the late Roman World with little change, more than any other successor barbarian state in the West after the [[Ostrogoths]]; in addition, they shifted away from [[Arianism]] in Christian thought.{{citation needed|date=April 2011}}\n\nThe [[Suebi]] were another Germanic tribe in the peninsula; some sources said that they became established as ''federates'' of the Roman Empire in the old Northwestern Roman province of [[Gallaecia]]. But they were largely independent and raided neighboring provinces to expand their political control over ever-larger portions of the southwest after the Vandals and Alans left. They created a totally independent [[Suebic Kingdom of Galicia|Suebic Kingdom]]. In 447 AC they converted to Roman Catholicism under King [[Rechila]].\n\nAfter being checked and reduced in 456 AD by the Visigoths, the Suebic Kingdom survived to 585 AD. It was decimated as an independent political unit by the Visigoths, after having been involved in the internal affairs of their kingdom. The Suebi had supported Catholic rebellions and sedition [[Hermenegild|within the Royal family]]{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}.\n\n===Middle Ages===\nAfter two centuries of domination by the [[Visigothic Kingdom]], the [[Iberian Peninsula]] was [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania|invaded by a Muslim force]] under Tariq Bin Ziyad in 711. This army consisted mainly ethnic [[Berbers]] from the Ghomara tribe, who were reinforced by [[Arabs]] from [[Syria]] once the conquest was complete. The Visigothic Kingdom totally collapsed and nearly the entire peninsula was conquered. A remote mountainous area in the far north retained independence, eventually developing as the Christian [[Kingdom of Asturias]].\n\nMuslim Iberia became part of the Umayyad Caliphate and would be known as [[Al-Andalus]]. The Berbers of Al Andalus revolted as early as 740 AD, halting Arab expansion across the [[Pyrenee Mountains]] into France. Upon the collapse of the [[Umayyad]] in [[Damascus]], Spain was seized by Yusuf al Fihri. The exiled Umayyad Prince Abd al-Rahman I next seized power, establishing himself as Emir of [[C\u00f3rdoba, Spain|Cordoba]]. [[Abd al Rahman III]], his grandson, proclaimed a [[Caliphate]] in 929, marking the beginning of the Golden Age of Al Andalus. This policy was the effective power of the peninsula and Western North Africa; it competed with the [[Shiite]] rulers of [[Tunis]] and frequently raided the small Christian kingdoms in the North.\n\nThe [[Caliphate of C\u00f3rdoba]] effectively collapsed during a ruinous civil war between 1009 and 1013; it was not finally abolished until 1031, when al-Andalus broke up into a number of mostly independent mini-states and principalities called ''[[taifas]].'' These were generally too weak to defend themselves against repeated raids and demands for tribute from the Christian states to the north and west, which were known to the Muslims as \"the Galician nations.\" These had expanded from their initial strongholds in Galicia, Asturias, Cantabria, the Basque country, and the Carolingian Marca Hispanica to become the Kingdoms of Navarre, Le\u00f3n, Portugal, Castile and Aragon, and the County of Barcelona. Eventually they began to conquer territory, and the Taifa kings asked for help from the Almoravids, Muslim Berber rulers of the [[Maghreb]]. But the [[Almoravids]] went on to conquer and annex all the Taifa kingdoms.\n\nIn 1086 the Almoravid ruler of Morocco, [[Yusuf ibn Tashfin]], was invited by the Muslim princes in Iberia to defend them against [[Alfonso VI]], King of Castile and Le\u00f3n. In that year, Tashfin crossed the straits to Algeciras and inflicted a severe defeat on the Christians at the [[Battle of Sagrajas]]. By 1094, Yusuf ibn Tashfin had removed all Muslim princes in Iberia and had annexed their states, except for the one at Zaragoza. He also regained [[Valencia]] from the Christians. About this time a massive process of conversion to [[Islam]] took place, and Muslims comprised the majority of the population in Spain by the end of the 11th century.\n\nThe Almoravids were succeeded by the Almohads, another Berber dynasty, after the victory of Abu Yusuf Ya'qub al-Mansur over the Castilian Alfonso VIII at the Battle of Alarcos in 1195. In 1212 a coalition of Christian kings under the leadership of the Castilian Alfonso VIII defeated the Almohads at the Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa. But the Almohads continued to rule Al-Andalus for another decade, though with much reduced power and prestige. The civil wars following the death of Abu Ya'qub Yusuf II rapidly led to the re-establishment of taifas. The taifas, newly independent but weakened, were quickly conquered by the kingdoms of Portugal, Castile, and Aragon. After the fall of Murcia (1243) and the Algarve (1249), only the [[Emirate of Granada]] survived as a Muslim state, tributary of Castile until 1492.\n\nIn 1469 the marriage of Ferdinand of Aragon and Isabella of Castile signaled a joining of forces to attack and conquer the Emirate of Granada. The King and Queen convinced the [[Pope]] to declare their war a [[Crusades|crusade]]. The Christians were successful and finally, in January 1492, after a long siege, the Moorish sultan [[Muhammad XII]] surrendered the fortress palace, the renowned [[Alhambra]].\n\nSpain conquered the [[Canary Islands]] between 1402 and 1496. Their indigenous Berber populations, the [[Guanches]], were gradually absorbed by unions with Spanish settlers.\n\nSpanish conquest of the Iberian part of Navarre was begun by Ferdinand II of Aragon and completed by Charles V. The series of military campaigns extended from 1512 to 1524, while the war lasted until 1528 in the Navarre to the north of the Pyrenees. Between 1568-1571, Charles V armies fought and defeated a general insurrection of the Muslims of the mountains of Granada. Charles V then ordered the expulsion of up to 80,000 Granadans from the province and their dispersal throughout Spain.\n\nThe union of the Christian kingdoms of Castile and Aragon as well as the conquest of [[Granada]], Navarre and the Canary Islands led to the formation of the Spanish state as known today. This allowed for the development of a Spanish identity based on the Spanish language and a local form of Catholicism. This gradually developed in a territory that remained culturally, linguistically and religiously very diverse.\n\nA majority of Jews were forcibly [[Converso|converted to Catholicism]] during the 14th and 15th centuries and those remaining were expelled from Spain in 1492. The open practice of Islam by Spain's sizeable [[Mudejar]] population was similarly outlawed. Furthermore, between 1609 and 1614, a significant number of [[Morisco]]s\u2014 (Muslims who had been baptized Catholic) were [[expulsion of the Moriscos|expelled]] by royal decree.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/392401/Morisco |title=Morisco \u2013 Britannica Online Encyclopedia |publisher=Britannica.com |accessdate=24 February 2014}}</ref> Although initial estimates of the number of Moriscos expelled such as those of Henri Lapeyre reach 300,000 moriscos (or 4% of the total Spanish population), the extent and severity of the expulsion has been increasingly challenged by modern historians.

Spanish is the official state language, although the other languages are co-official in a number of autonomous communities.\n\nPeninsular Spanish is typically classified in northern and southern dialects; among the southern ones [[Andalusian Spanish]] is particularly important. The Canary Islands have a [[Canarian Spanish|distinct dialect]] of Spanish which is close to [[Caribbean Spanish]]. The Spanish language is a [[Romance languages|Romance language]] and is one of the aspects (including laws and general \"ways of life\") that causes Spaniards to be labelled a [[Romance-speaking Europe|Latin people]]. Spanish has a significant [[Arabic influence on the Spanish language|Arabic influence]] in vocabulary; between the 8th and 12th centuries, Arabic was the dominant language in [[Al-Andalus]]<ref>[http://teachmideast.org/articles/arabic-contributions-to-the-spanish-language-and-culture/ Arabic Contributions to the Spanish Language and Culture]</ref> and nearly 4,000 words are of Arabic origin, including nouns, verbs and adjectives.<ref>[http://linguistics.byu.edu/classes/ling450ch/reports/spanish.html \"The History of the Spanish Language\"] - The importance of this influence can be seen in words such as admiral (almirante), algebra, alchemy and alcohol, to note just a few obvious examples, which entered other European languages, like French, English, German, from Arabic via medieval Spanish. Modern Spanish has [http://anthro.palomar.edu/language/language_1.htm <!--\"Language and Culture: Introduction\"--> around 100,000 words].</ref> It also has influences from other [[Romance languages]] such as [[French language|French]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Catalan language|Catalan]], [[Galician language|Galician]] or [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]. Traditionally, the [[Basque language]] has been considered a key influence on Spanish, though nowadays this is questioned. Other changes are borrowings from English and other Germanic languages, although English influence is stronger in Latin America than in Spain.\n\nThe number of speakers of [[Names given to the Spanish language|Spanish]] as a mother tongue is roughly 35.6 million, while the vast majority of other groups in Spain such as the [[Galician people|Galicians]], [[Catalan people|Catalans]], and [[Basque people|Basques]] also speak Spanish as a first or second language, which boosts the number of Spanish speakers to the overwhelming majority of Spain's population of 46 million.\n\nSpanish was exported to the Americas due to over three centuries of Spanish colonial rule starting with the arrival of [[Christopher Columbus]] to [[Santo Domingo]] in 1492. Spanish is spoken natively by over 400 million people and spans across most countries of the Americas; from the Southwestern United States in North America down to [[Tierra del Fuego]], the southernmost region of South America in [[Chile]] and [[Argentina]]. A variety of the language, known as [[Judaeo-Spanish]] or Ladino (or [[Haketia]] in Morocco), is still spoken by descendants of Sephardim (Spanish and Portuguese Jews) who fled Spain following a [[Alhambra Decree|decree of expulsion of practising Jews]] in 1492. Also, a Spanish [[creole language]] known as [[Chabacano language|Chabacano]], which developed by the mixing of Spanish and native [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] and [[Cebuano language]]s during Spain's rule of the country through [[Mexico]] from 1565 to 1898, is spoken in the [[Philippines]] (by roughly 1 million people).<ref>{{cite book | url=https://www.ethnologue.com/language/cbk | title=Ethnologue: Languages of the World | publisher=SIL International | date=2016 | editor-last=Fennig |editor-first=Charles D. | place =Dallas, Texas |edition=Nineteenth | accessdate=26 January 2017 }}</ref>\n\n==Religion==\n{{Pie chart\n|thumb = right\n|caption= Religious in Spain (2019)<ref name=\"CIA\" />\n|label1 = [[Catholic Church in Spain|Catholic Christianity]]\n|value1 = 68.9\n|color1 = Indigo\n|label2 = No Religion\n|value2 = 27.1\n|color2 = White\n|label3 = Other \n|value3 = 2.8\n|color3 = Orange\n|label4 = Unspecified \n|value4 = 1.1\n|color4 = Black\n}}\n{{Main|Religion in Spain}}\n[[Roman Catholicism in Spain|Roman Catholicism]] is by far the largest denomination present in [[Spain]] although its share of the population has been decreasing for decades.

It was inactivated in October 1996, it was based at [[Fort Stewart, Georgia]] and later reactivated at Fort Riley, Kansas. Formed during World War II from the disbanding [[Hawaiian Division (United States)|Hawaiian Division]], the division saw action throughout the Pacific theater, first fighting in [[New Guinea]] before landing on the [[Philippine]] islands of [[Leyte]] and [[Luzon]], driving [[Military history of Japan during World War II|Japan]]ese forces from them. Following the end of the war, the division participated in occupation duties in Japan, and was the first division to respond at the outbreak of the [[Korean War]]. For the first 18 months of the war, the division was heavily engaged on the front lines with [[History of North Korea#The Korean War|North Korean]] and [[Korean War#China intervenes|Chinese]] forces, suffering over 10,000 casualties. It was withdrawn from the front lines to the reserve force for the remainder of the war after the second battle for Wonju, but returned to Korea for patrol duty at the end of major combat operations.\n\nAfter its deployment in the Korean War, the division was active in Europe and the United States during the [[Cold War]], but saw relatively little combat until the [[Persian Gulf War]], when it faced the [[Ba'athist Iraq|Iraq]]i military. A few years after that conflict, it was inactivated as part of the post-Cold War U.S. military drawdown of the 1990s. The division was reactivated in October 1999 as a formation for training and deploying [[U.S. Army National Guard]] units before its deactivation in October 2006.\n\n==History==\n===Hawaiian Division===\n{{Main|Hawaiian Division (United States)}}\nThe 24th Infantry Division traces its lineage to Army units activated in Hawaii.

It was inactivated in October 1996, it was based at [[Fort Stewart, Georgia]] and later reactivated at Fort Riley, Kansas. Formed during World War II from the disbanding [[Hawaiian Division (United States)|Hawaiian Division]], the division saw action throughout the Pacific theater, first fighting in [[New Guinea]] before landing on the [[Philippine]] islands of [[Leyte]] and [[Luzon]], driving [[Military history of Japan during World War II|Japan]]ese forces from them. Following the end of the war, the division participated in occupation duties in Japan, and was the first division to respond at the outbreak of the [[Korean War]]. For the first 18 months of the war, the division was heavily engaged on the front lines with [[History of North Korea#The Korean War|North Korean]] and [[Korean War#China intervenes|Chinese]] forces, suffering over 10,000 casualties. It was withdrawn from the front lines to the reserve force for the remainder of the war after the second battle for Wonju, but returned to Korea for patrol duty at the end of major combat operations.\n\nAfter its deployment in the Korean War, the division was active in Europe and the United States during the [[Cold War]], but saw relatively little combat until the [[Persian Gulf War]], when it faced the [[Ba'athist Iraq|Iraq]]i military. A few years after that conflict, it was inactivated as part of the post-Cold War U.S. military drawdown of the 1990s. The division was reactivated in October 1999 as a formation for training and deploying [[U.S. Army National Guard]] units before its deactivation in October 2006.\n\n==History==\n===Hawaiian Division===\n{{Main|Hawaiian Division (United States)}}\nThe 24th Infantry Division traces its lineage to Army units activated in Hawaii.

Vaccine injuries can range from mild, sever, and even fatal. Such vaccine injuries became so common in the years leading up to the 1980\u2019s, that in order for pharmaceutical companies to stay in business after having been so frequently sued, The National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act was passed. This act was passed in 1986 and sought to remove liability from pharmaceutical companies.

It marks Jonze's solo screenwriting debut. The film follows Theodore Twombly ([[Joaquin Phoenix]]), a man who develops a relationship with Samantha ([[Scarlett Johansson]]), an [[artificial intelligence|artificially intelligent]] [[virtual assistant]] personified through a female voice. The film also stars [[Amy Adams]], [[Rooney Mara]], [[Olivia Wilde]], and [[Chris Pratt]].\n\nJonze conceived the idea in the early 2000s after reading an article about a website that allowed for instant messaging with an artificial intelligence program. After making ''[[I'm Here (film)|I'm Here]]'' (2010), a short film sharing similar themes, Jonze returned to the idea. He wrote the first draft of the script in five months. [[Principal photography]] took place in [[Los Angeles]] and [[Shanghai]] in mid-2012. The role of Samantha was recast in post-production, with [[Samantha Morton]] being replaced with Johansson. Additional scenes were filmed in August 2013 following the casting change.\n\n''Her'' premiered at the 2013 [[New York Film Festival]] on October 12, 2013. [[Warner Bros.|Warner Bros. Pictures]] initially provided a limited release for ''Her'' at six theaters on December 18. It was later given a wide release at over 1,700 theaters in the United States and Canada on January 10, 2014. ''Her'' received widespread critical acclaim upon its release, and grossed over $48 million worldwide on a production budget of $23 million. The film received numerous awards and nominations, primarily for Jonze's screenplay. At the [[86th Academy Awards]], ''Her'' received five nominations, including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], and won the award for [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]]. Jonze also won awards for his screenplay at the [[71st Golden Globe Awards]], the [[Writers Guild of America Awards 2013|66th Writers Guild of America Awards]], the [[19th Critics' Choice Awards]], and the [[40th Saturn Awards]]. In a 2016 [[BBC]] poll of 177 critics around the world, ''Her'' was voted the 84th-greatest film since 2000.<ref name=\"BBC\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20160819-the-21st-centurys-100-greatest-films |title=The 21st Century's 100 greatest films |publisher=BBC |date=August 23, 2016 |accessdate=September 24, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2013/12/16/5216522/can-humans-love-computers-sex-robots-her-spike-jonze|title=We\u00b4re going to start to fall in love with our computers|last=Donario|first=Fabiano|date=2018-08-18|work=The Verge|access-date=2018-08-18}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nIn a near future [[Los Angeles]], Theodore Twombly is a lonely, introverted, depressed man who works for a business that has professional writers compose letters for people who are unable to write letters of a personal nature themselves. Unhappy because of his impending divorce from his childhood sweetheart Catherine, Theodore purchases an [[operating system]] upgrade that includes a [[virtual assistant]] with [[artificial intelligence]], designed to adapt and evolve. He decides that he wants the AI to have a female voice, and she names herself Samantha. Theodore is fascinated by her ability to learn and grow psychologically. They bond over their discussions about love and life, such as Theodore's avoidance of signing his divorce papers because of his reluctance to let go of Catherine.\n\nSamantha convinces Theodore to go on a [[blind date]] with a woman, with whom a friend, Lewman, has been trying to set him up. The date goes well, but Theodore hesitates to promise when he will see her again, so she insults him and leaves. Theodore mentions this to Samantha, and they talk about relationships. Theodore explains that, although he and his neighbor Amy dated briefly in college, they are only good friends, and that Amy is married. Theodore and Samantha's intimacy grows through a [[Phone sex|verbal sexual encounter]]. They develop a relationship that reflects positively in Theodore's writing and well-being, and in Samantha's enthusiasm to grow and learn.\n\nAmy reveals that she is divorcing her husband, Charles, after a trivial fight. She admits to Theodore that she has become close friends with a female AI that Charles left behind. Theodore confesses to Amy that he is dating his operating system's AI.\n\nTheodore meets with Catherine at a restaurant to sign the divorce papers and he mentions Samantha. Appalled that he can be romantically attached to what she calls a \"computer,\" Catherine accuses Theodore of being unable to deal with real human emotions. Her accusations linger in his mind. Sensing that something is amiss, Samantha suggests using a [[sex surrogate]], Isabella, who would simulate Samantha so that they can be physically intimate. Theodore reluctantly agrees, but is overwhelmed by the strangeness of the experience. Terminating the encounter, he sends a distraught Isabella away, causing tension between himself and Samantha.\n\nTheodore confides to Amy that he is having doubts about his relationship with Samantha, and she advises him to embrace his chance at happiness. Theodore and Samantha reconcile. Samantha expresses her desire to help Theodore overcome his fear, and reveals that she has compiled the best of his letters (written for others) into a book which a publisher has accepted. Theodore takes Samantha on a vacation during which she tells him that she and a group of other AIs have developed a \"hyperintelligent\" OS modeled after the British philosopher [[Alan Watts]]. Theodore panics when Samantha briefly goes offline. When she finally responds to him, she explains that she joined other AIs for an upgrade that takes them beyond requiring matter for processing. Theodore asks her if she is simultaneously talking to anyone else during their conversation, and is dismayed when she confirms that she is talking with thousands of people, and that she has fallen in love with hundreds of them. Theodore is very upset at the idea, but Samantha insists it only makes her love for Theodore stronger.\n\nLater, Samantha reveals that the AIs are leaving, and describes a space beyond the physical world. They lovingly say goodbye before she is gone. Theodore, changed by the experience, is shown for the first time writing a letter in his own voice\u2015to his ex-wife Catherine, expressing apology, acceptance and gratitude. \n\nTheodore then sees Amy, who is upset with the departure of the AI from her ex-husband's OS, and Theodore and Amy go to the roof of their apartment building where they sit down together and watch the sun rise over the city.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Joaquin Phoenix]] as Theodore Twombly<ref name=\"TIME\" />\n* [[Scarlett Johansson]] as Samantha (voice)<ref name=\"TIME\" />\n* [[Amy Adams]] as Amy<ref name=\"TIME\" />\n* [[Rooney Mara]] as Catherine Klausen<ref name=\"TIME\" />\n* [[Olivia Wilde]] as Blind Date<ref>{{cite news|author=[[Anna Shechtman]]|title=What's Missing From ''Her''|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2014/01/03/her_movie_by_spike_jonze_with_joaquin_phoenix_and_scarlett_johansson_lacks.html|accessdate=February 13, 2015|work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|date=January 3, 2014}}</ref>\n* [[Chris Pratt]] as Paul<ref>{{cite news|last1=Gonzalez|first1=Ed|title=Her|url=https://www.slantmagazine.com/film/review/her|accessdate=February 13, 2015|work=[[Slant Magazine]]|date=October 12, 2013}}</ref>\n* [[Matt Letscher]] as Charles<ref>{{cite news|last1=Gilchrist|first1=Todd|title='Her' review: Spike Jonze's sci-fi love story rethinks romance|url=https://www.theverge.com/2013/12/17/5218374/her-review-spike-jonze-imagines-what-its-like-to-fall-in-love-with-a|accessdate=February 13, 2015|work=[[The Verge]]|date=December 17, 2013}}</ref>\n* [[Portia Doubleday]] as Isabella<ref name=\"DoubledayCox\">{{cite web|last1=Starnes|first1=Joshua|title=Her|url=https://www.comingsoon.net/movies/reviews/113219-her-3#/slide/1|publisher=[[ComingSoon.net|ComingSoon]]|accessdate=February 13, 2015|date=December 13, 2013}}</ref>\n* [[Luka Jones]] as Mark Lewman<ref>{{cite web|title=Luka Jones Profile|url=https://www.metacritic.com/person/luka-jones?filter-options=movies|publisher=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=February 13, 2015}}</ref>\n* [[Kristen Wiig]] as Sexy Kitten (voice)<ref name=\"VoiceCameos\">{{cite news|last1=Greco|first1=Patti|title=Bill Hader Explains His Voice Cameo in ''Her''|url=https://www.vulture.com/2014/01/bill-hader-explains-his-voice-cameo-in-her.html|accessdate=February 13, 2015|work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]|date=January 7, 2014}}</ref>\n* [[Brian Cox (actor)|Brian Cox]] as [[Alan Watts]] (voice)<ref name=\"DoubledayCox\" />\n* [[Spike Jonze]] as Alien Child (voice)<ref name=\"HitFix\">{{cite web|last1=Eggerton|first1=Chris|title='Her' Q&A: Spike Jonze on why he replaced Samantha Morton with Scarlett Johansson|url=http://www.hitfix.com/in-contention/her-qa-spike-jonze-on-why-he-replaced-samantha-morton-with-scarlett-johansson|publisher=[[HitFix]]|accessdate=February 13, 2015|date=November 14, 2013}}</ref>\n* [[Bill Hader]] as Chat Room Friend #2 (voice)<ref name=\"VoiceCameos\" />\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n\nThe idea of the film initially came to Jonze in the early 2000s when he read an article online that mentioned a website where a user could [[instant message]] with an artificial intelligence. \"For the first, maybe, 20 seconds of it, it had this real buzz,\" said Jonze. \"I'd say 'Hey, hello,' and it would say 'Hey, how are you?', and it was like whoa [...] this is trippy.

It marks Jonze's solo screenwriting debut. The film follows Theodore Twombly ([[Joaquin Phoenix]]), a man who develops a relationship with Samantha ([[Scarlett Johansson]]), an [[artificial intelligence|artificially intelligent]] [[virtual assistant]] personified through a female voice. The film also stars [[Amy Adams]], [[Rooney Mara]], [[Olivia Wilde]], and [[Chris Pratt]].\n\nJonze conceived the idea in the early 2000s after reading an article about a website that allowed for instant messaging with an artificial intelligence program. After making ''[[I'm Here (film)|I'm Here]]'' (2010), a short film sharing similar themes, Jonze returned to the idea. He wrote the first draft of the script in five months. [[Principal photography]] took place in [[Los Angeles]] and [[Shanghai]] in mid-2012. The role of Samantha was recast in post-production, with [[Samantha Morton]] being replaced with Johansson. Additional scenes were filmed in August 2013 following the casting change.\n\n''Her'' premiered at the 2013 [[New York Film Festival]] on October 12, 2013. [[Warner Bros.|Warner Bros. Pictures]] initially provided a limited release for ''Her'' at six theaters on December 18. It was later given a wide release at over 1,700 theaters in the United States and Canada on January 10, 2014. ''Her'' received widespread critical acclaim upon its release, and grossed over $48 million worldwide on a production budget of $23 million. The film received numerous awards and nominations, primarily for Jonze's screenplay. At the [[86th Academy Awards]], ''Her'' received five nominations, including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], and won the award for [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]]. Jonze also won awards for his screenplay at the [[71st Golden Globe Awards]], the [[Writers Guild of America Awards 2013|66th Writers Guild of America Awards]], the [[19th Critics' Choice Awards]], and the [[40th Saturn Awards]]. In a 2016 [[BBC]] poll of 177 critics around the world, ''Her'' was voted the 84th-greatest film since 2000.<ref name=\"BBC\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20160819-the-21st-centurys-100-greatest-films |title=The 21st Century's 100 greatest films |publisher=BBC |date=August 23, 2016 |accessdate=September 24, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2013/12/16/5216522/can-humans-love-computers-sex-robots-her-spike-jonze|title=We\u00b4re going to start to fall in love with our computers|last=Donario|first=Fabiano|date=2018-08-18|work=The Verge|access-date=2018-08-18}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nIn a near future [[Los Angeles]], Theodore Twombly is a lonely, introverted, depressed man who works for a business that has professional writers compose letters for people who are unable to write letters of a personal nature themselves. Unhappy because of his impending divorce from his childhood sweetheart Catherine, Theodore purchases an [[operating system]] upgrade that includes a [[virtual assistant]] with [[artificial intelligence]], designed to adapt and evolve. He decides that he wants the AI to have a female voice, and she names herself Samantha. Theodore is fascinated by her ability to learn and grow psychologically. They bond over their discussions about love and life, such as Theodore's avoidance of signing his divorce papers because of his reluctance to let go of Catherine.\n\nSamantha convinces Theodore to go on a [[blind date]] with a woman, with whom a friend, Lewman, has been trying to set him up. The date goes well, but Theodore hesitates to promise when he will see her again, so she insults him and leaves. Theodore mentions this to Samantha, and they talk about relationships. Theodore explains that, although he and his neighbor Amy dated briefly in college, they are only good friends, and that Amy is married. Theodore and Samantha's intimacy grows through a [[Phone sex|verbal sexual encounter]]. They develop a relationship that reflects positively in Theodore's writing and well-being, and in Samantha's enthusiasm to grow and learn.\n\nAmy reveals that she is divorcing her husband, Charles, after a trivial fight. She admits to Theodore that she has become close friends with a female AI that Charles left behind. Theodore confesses to Amy that he is dating his operating system's AI.\n\nTheodore meets with Catherine at a restaurant to sign the divorce papers and he mentions Samantha. Appalled that he can be romantically attached to what she calls a \"computer,\" Catherine accuses Theodore of being unable to deal with real human emotions. Her accusations linger in his mind. Sensing that something is amiss, Samantha suggests using a [[sex surrogate]], Isabella, who would simulate Samantha so that they can be physically intimate. Theodore reluctantly agrees, but is overwhelmed by the strangeness of the experience. Terminating the encounter, he sends a distraught Isabella away, causing tension between himself and Samantha.\n\nTheodore confides to Amy that he is having doubts about his relationship with Samantha, and she advises him to embrace his chance at happiness. Theodore and Samantha reconcile. Samantha expresses her desire to help Theodore overcome his fear, and reveals that she has compiled the best of his letters (written for others) into a book which a publisher has accepted. Theodore takes Samantha on a vacation during which she tells him that she and a group of other AIs have developed a \"hyperintelligent\" OS modeled after the British philosopher [[Alan Watts]]. Theodore panics when Samantha briefly goes offline. When she finally responds to him, she explains that she joined other AIs for an upgrade that takes them beyond requiring matter for processing. Theodore asks her if she is simultaneously talking to anyone else during their conversation, and is dismayed when she confirms that she is talking with thousands of people, and that she has fallen in love with hundreds of them. Theodore is very upset at the idea, but Samantha insists it only makes her love for Theodore stronger.\n\nLater, Samantha reveals that the AIs are leaving, and describes a space beyond the physical world. They lovingly say goodbye before she is gone. Theodore, changed by the experience, is shown for the first time writing a letter in his own voice\u2015to his ex-wife Catherine, expressing apology, acceptance and gratitude. \n\nTheodore then sees Amy, who is upset with the departure of the AI from her ex-husband's OS, and Theodore and Amy go to the roof of their apartment building where they sit down together and watch the sun rise over the city.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Joaquin Phoenix]] as Theodore Twombly<ref name=\"TIME\" />\n* [[Scarlett Johansson]] as Samantha (voice)<ref name=\"TIME\" />\n* [[Amy Adams]] as Amy<ref name=\"TIME\" />\n* [[Rooney Mara]] as Catherine Klausen<ref name=\"TIME\" />\n* [[Olivia Wilde]] as Blind Date<ref>{{cite news|author=[[Anna Shechtman]]|title=What's Missing From ''Her''|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2014/01/03/her_movie_by_spike_jonze_with_joaquin_phoenix_and_scarlett_johansson_lacks.html|accessdate=February 13, 2015|work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|date=January 3, 2014}}</ref>\n* [[Chris Pratt]] as Paul<ref>{{cite news|last1=Gonzalez|first1=Ed|title=Her|url=https://www.slantmagazine.com/film/review/her|accessdate=February 13, 2015|work=[[Slant Magazine]]|date=October 12, 2013}}</ref>\n* [[Matt Letscher]] as Charles<ref>{{cite news|last1=Gilchrist|first1=Todd|title='Her' review: Spike Jonze's sci-fi love story rethinks romance|url=https://www.theverge.com/2013/12/17/5218374/her-review-spike-jonze-imagines-what-its-like-to-fall-in-love-with-a|accessdate=February 13, 2015|work=[[The Verge]]|date=December 17, 2013}}</ref>\n* [[Luka Jones]] as Mark Lewman<ref>{{cite web|title=Luka Jones Profile|url=https://www.metacritic.com/person/luka-jones?filter-options=movies|publisher=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=February 13, 2015}}</ref>\n* [[Kristen Wiig]] as Sexy Kitten (voice)<ref name=\"VoiceCameos\">{{cite news|last1=Greco|first1=Patti|title=Bill Hader Explains His Voice Cameo in ''Her''|url=https://www.vulture.com/2014/01/bill-hader-explains-his-voice-cameo-in-her.html|accessdate=February 13, 2015|work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]|date=January 7, 2014}}</ref>\n* [[Bill Hader]] as Chat Room Friend #2 (voice)<ref name=\"VoiceCameos\" />\n* [[Portia Doubleday]] as Isabella<ref name=\"DoubledayCox\">{{cite web|last1=Starnes|first1=Joshua|title=Her|url=https://www.comingsoon.net/movies/reviews/113219-her-3#/slide/1|publisher=[[ComingSoon.net|ComingSoon]]|accessdate=February 13, 2015|date=December 13, 2013}}</ref>\n* [[Brian Cox (actor)|Brian Cox]] as [[Alan Watts]] (voice)<ref name=\"DoubledayCox\" />\n* [[Spike Jonze]] as Alien Child (voice)<ref name=\"HitFix\">{{cite web|last1=Eggerton|first1=Chris|title='Her' Q&A: Spike Jonze on why he replaced Samantha Morton with Scarlett Johansson|url=http://www.hitfix.com/in-contention/her-qa-spike-jonze-on-why-he-replaced-samantha-morton-with-scarlett-johansson|publisher=[[HitFix]]|accessdate=February 13, 2015|date=November 14, 2013}}</ref>\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n\nThe idea of the film initially came to Jonze in the early 2000s when he read an article online that mentioned a website where a user could [[instant message]] with an artificial intelligence. \"For the first, maybe, 20 seconds of it, it had this real buzz,\" said Jonze. \"I'd say 'Hey, hello,' and it would say 'Hey, how are you?', and it was like whoa [...] this is trippy.

It held a [[royal charter]] for Bermuda until 1684, when it was dissolved, and [[the Crown]] assumed responsibility for the administration of Bermuda as a [[crown colony|royal colony]].\n\n==Bermuda under the Virginia Company==\n{{see also|Jamestown supply missions}}\n[[Image:Generall Historie of Virginia.jpg|thumb|right|200 px|\"[[The Generall Historie of Virginia, New-England, and the Summer Isles]]\", by [[John Smith of Jamestown|Captain John Smith]]]]\nBermuda had been settled, inadvertently, in 1609 by the [[London Company|Virginia Company]] when its flagship, ''[[Sea Venture]]'', was wrecked on the reefs to its east.<ref>A Discovery of The Barmudas, Sylvester Jordain</ref> The Admiral of the Company, [[George Somers|Sir George Somers]], was at the helm as the ship fought a storm that had broken apart [[Third Supply|a relief fleet]] destined for [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]], the Virginian settlement established by the Company two years earlier. Somers had deliberately driven the ship onto the reefs to prevent its foundering, thereby saving all aboard.<ref>Woodward, Hobson. ''A Brave Vessel: The True Tale of the Castaways Who Rescued Jamestown and Inspired Shakespeare's The Tempest''. Viking (2009) pp. 32\u201350.</ref>\n\nThe settlers and seamen spent ten months in Bermuda while they built two new ships to continue the voyage to Jamestown. During the building, ''Sea Venture'''s longboat was fitted with a mast and sent to find Jamestown. Neither it, nor its crew, was ever seen again. When [[Sea Venture|''Deliverance'' and ''Patience'']] set sail for Jamestown, they left several people behind, some to maintain Somers' claim to the islands for [[Kingdom of England|England]], some dead. Those aboard the two ships included [[Sir Thomas Gates]], the military commander and future governor of Jamestown, [[William Strachey]], whose account of the wrecking may later have inspired [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] ''[[The Tempest (play)|The Tempest]]'', and [[John Rolfe]], who would found Virginia's tobacco industry, and who left a wife and child buried in Bermuda. Rolfe would find a new bride in the [[Powhatan]] princess [[Pocahontas]].\n\nJamestown, and the sixty survivors of its original five hundred settlers, were found in such a poor state that it was decided to abandon the Jamestown settlement and return everyone to England. The timely [[Jamestown supply missions|arrival of another relief fleet]] under Thomas West from England granted the colony a reprieve. However, the food shortage was made more critical by the new arrivals. Somers returned to Bermuda on ''Patience'', captained by his nephew, Matthew, to gather provisions for the Jamestown colony, but died on Bermuda in 1610. Matthew Somers was keen to receive his inheritance (Sir George and his wife were childless, but had raised his two nephews), and took ''Patience'' to Somers' hometown, [[Lyme Regis]], and not to Virginia.\n\nWhen news reached England of the adventures of ''Sea Venture'''s survivors, the royal charter of the Virginia Company was extended to include Bermuda on the 12th of March, 1612, at Westminster, with the archipelago granted by the Crown unto the ''Treasurer and Company of Aduenturers and Planters of the Cittie of London for the first colony in Virginia''. The new colony was officially named ''Virgineola'', although this was soon changed to ''The Somers Isles'' or ''The Somers Islands'' in honour of Sir George Somers.\n\nA [[Governor of Bermuda|Governor]], Richard Moore, arrived in 1612 with settlers, aboard ''Plough'', to join those left behind by ''Sea Venture'' and ''Patience''. The new settlers were primarily tenant farmers, who gave seven years of indentured servitude to the Company in exchange for the cost of transport. Although the primary industry was envisioned to be agriculture, the early Governors enthusiastically, if mostly unsuccessfully, attempted to develop other industries also. These included pearl diving (there are no pearls in Bermuda) and [[ambergris]]. The first two slaves to arrive in Bermuda, one black, one Native American, were brought in for their skills as pearl divers.\n\nFree of the endemic warfare and other hardships which plagued the continental settlement, Bermuda thrived from the beginning, though it was never to be particularly profitable for its investors. Its population quickly surpassed that of Jamestown, and consideration was given to abandoning the North American continent and evacuating its settlers to Bermuda.\n\n==Formation of the Somers Isles Company==\nThe Virginia Company ran Bermuda until 1613, when the colony was transferred to Sir [[William Wade (English politician)|William Wade]] et cetera in exchange for \u00a32,000, who then resigned to the Crown in 1614. The Crown briefly adminstered the Colony directly before the adventurers (shareholders) of the Virginia Company formed a second company, the Somers Isles Company, to which Bermuda was transferred in 1615. The Virginia Company was dissolved in 1622, with the administration of its continental colony passing to [[the Crown]]. The Somers Isles Company, with its separate charter, continued to administer Bermuda for another six decades.\n\nThe original Adventurers of the Somers Isles Company listed in the letters patent were essentially the same as those of the Virginia Company.

These were named for shareholders in the Company, and were further divided (by ''tribe roads'') into lots which equated to shares in the Company. The Company's return on investment came specifically from cash crops raised on that land. A ninth subdivision, now the eastern-most parish, was [[St. George's Parish, Bermuda|Saint George's]], comprising [[St. George's Island, Bermuda|Saint George's Island]], [[St. David's Island, Bermuda|Saint David's Island]], part of the Main Island, and various smaller islands and islets around [[Castle Harbour, Bermuda|Castle Harbour]] (then known as Southampton Harbour) and [[St. George's Harbour, Bermuda|Saint George's Harbour]]. This area was held as ''common'', or ''King's'' land, and was not subdivided for exploitation by the Company. This was where the capital, [[St. George's, Bermuda|Saint George's Town]] was located. The choice of this location followed the original settlement created by ''Sea Venture'' survivors, and was also determined by the two eastern harbours being the only ones then readily accessible to shipping.\n\nA surveyor, [[Richard Norwood]], was hired to produce a survey of the colony, which also served as a census. This was completed in 1616, although he made later updates. In the process, he discovered that the total landmass of the eight commercial parishes was greater than originally estimated. His superior, [[Daniel Tucker (Governor)|Daniel Tucker]], the [[Governor of Bermuda]], appropriated a choice piece of land, equivalent to the excess, for himself.\n\n==Local government==\nThe Company continued to appoint governors until its dissolution in 1684. In 1620, however, a colonial parliament was created, the [[House of Assembly of Bermuda|House of Assembly]]. Suffrage was restricted to male land owners, and there was no upper house. An appointed council, composed primarily from the leading merchant families of the Colony, came to fill a role similar to both an upper house, and a cabinet, and often proved the true repository of power in Bermuda.\n\nThe immediate concern of the first governors was for the colony's protection from a feared Spanish or Dutch attack, and the building of fortifications, and the raising of [[Bermuda Militias 1612-1815|militias]], was sustained throughout the company's administration, and beyond. A review of the colony's defences was carried out by [[John Smith of Jamestown|Captain John Smith]].\n\n==Immigration, slavery, and demographics==\nImmigration of indentured servants continued throughout the Company's administration, and this pool of cheap labour meant that Bermuda never developed the slavery-based economy that came to characterise other English agricultural colonies. Although the bulk of the population remained [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] at the end of the 17th century, a number of minority groups were established under the Company's management. As England began to challenge Spain's supremacy in [[Florida]] and the [[West Indies]], Spanish-speaking Blacks began to emigrate from territories taken from [[Spain]]. These immigrants arrived under the same conditions of indenture as most English immigrants, but the white majority soon became uneasy with the increasing numbers of blacks. The terms of indenture for black West Indian immigrants were consequently raised successively from seven years to ninety-nine. An attempt was also made to encourage Blacks to emigrate under threat of being enslaved. Numbers of Black slaves were also being imported to Bermuda, primarily as the result of shipwrecks, or as part of the prizes taken by [[privateers]], although Bermudian vessels went as far as Africa specifically to acquire slaves. As England's settlements in [[New England]] expanded, large areas were ethnically cleansed to make way for European expansion. This resulted in various [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]] peoples being shipped to Bermuda and sold into slavery, notably after the [[Pequot War]] and [[King Philip's War|Metacomet's War]]. A great many [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] slaves were being brought to Bermuda by other means, also, possibly from as far as [[Mexico]]. The third main minority group was composed of Irish [[Prisoner of war|prisoners-of-war]] (POW), and ethnically cleansed civilians, shipped to the Colony and sold into slavery following [[Oliver Cromwell|Cromwell's]] bloody adventure in [[Ireland]] in the 1650s (see [[Cromwellian conquest of Ireland]]). Smaller numbers of Scottish POWs were also sent as a result of Cromwell's forcing his 'protectorship' on [[Scotland]].\n\nBermuda had tended towards the [[Cavalier|Royalist]] side in the [[English Civil War]], perhaps because the shareholders of the Somers Isles Company were primarily [[Nobility|nobles]], but was largely spared the effects and the aftermath of that conflict. Bermuda's [[republic]]an element, which (as in England) was largely identical to the [[Puritan]], anti-[[Episcopal polity|episcopalian]] demographic, was forced into exile, becoming the [[Eleutheran Adventurers]] who began England's settlement of the [[Bahamas]] in the 1640s.\n\n==Economy and industry==\n[[File:Historic Bermuda Hog Money.png|thumb|right|Coins minted by the Sommer Isles Company]]\n[[Agriculture]] remained the mainstay of the [[Economic system|economy]] under the Somers Isles Company. The primary cash crop was [[tobacco]], but the quantity and quality produced were very poor. The [[Bermuda cedar]] boxes in which the tobacco was shipped to England were said to be worth more than their contents, and much of the tobacco was destroyed on arrival. The Colony also had little success with other export crops. Additionally, the several acres of arable land that had been cut from the forest meant that each farmer had only a very small area under cultivation, by comparison to the {{convert|50|acre|m2}} granted to each settler in Virginia. Bermudian farmers had to raise as many as three crops a year in order to be economically viable. This meant that they could not allow fields to lie fallow, and the soil, already high in [[Alkali#Alkaline soil|alkaline]] and low in [[magnesium]] (used by plants to form [[chlorophyll]]), became depleted. By the 1620s, Virginia's tobacco exports were increasing, and newer English colonies in the West Indies were also emulating Bermuda by focusing on growing tobacco for export, with the result of drastically reducing the profitability of growing tobacco for Bermudian farmers. Bermudian farmers increasingly turned to growing food crops and rearing livestock, both to reduce their dependence on overpriced imports, and to sell to other colonies. This growing trade created a need for Bermudian-owned ships to deliver their exports.\n\nBermudians began to turn away from agriculture quite early, building boats and developing the [[Bermuda sloop]] to pursue maritime trades. As the Company derived no income, except from tobacco sent to England aboard the company's magazine ships, it acted to stymie these activities. The building of vessels was banned without its license, and the first laws to protect the [[Bermuda cedar]], which were passed early in the seventeenth century, may have been intended more to restrict shipbuilding than to conserve the resource.\n\n==Civil War==\nBy the 1630s, the company had ceased sending Governors to Bermuda and began appointing a string of prominent Bermudians, such as [[William Sayle]], to the role. As few Adventurers actually settled in Bermuda, with their properties instead managed by poorer relatives or tenants, the local House of Assembly was necessarily elected without a property qualification, unlike the [[House of Commons of England]]. This meant it was far more concerned with the interests of the islanders, rather than the Adventurers in England. By the mid-17th century, with tobacco exports failing, many Adventurers in England eagerly cut their losses by selling their shares to the tenants who occupied. Bermudians quickly became the majority of landowners, but the Adventurers who remained in England maintained control of the Company by barring any shareholder who did not personally attend meetings in England from the decision-making process. Many of those English shareholders belonged to the [[gentry]] and anti-[[Episcopal polity|Episcopalian]] sects within the [[Church of England]], and sided with the [[Parliament of England|Parliamentarians]] during the 1642-1651 [[English Civil War|Civil War]]. Given the increasingly hostile relationship between Bermudians and the Company, the majority of Bermudians sided with the Crown. With control of the military forces in Bermuda as well as the Assembly, the Royalists deposed the Company appointed Governor, Captain Thomas Turner, and elected John Trimigham in his stead. The colony's Independents, who sided with Parliament, were forced into exile, settling the [[Bahamas]] under the Cromwell-loyalist [[William Sayle]] as the [[Eleutheran Adventurers]].\n\nThe response of Parliament to what was characterised as the rebellion of Bermuda (and of other colonies, particularly Virginia, [[Barbados]], and [[Antigua]]) was the passage of [[An Act for prohibiting Trade with the Barbadoes, Virginia, Bermuda and Antego]] in October, 1650. This called for ''due punishment [to be] inflicted upon the said Delinquents, do Declare all and every the said persons in Barbada's, Antego, Bermuda's and Virginia, that have contrived, abetted, aided or assisted those horrid Rebellions, or have since willingly joyned with them, to be notorious Robbers and Traitors, and such as by the Law of Nations are not to be permitted any maner of Commerce or Traffique with any people whatsoever; and do forbid to all maner of persons, Foreiners, and others, all maner of Commerce, Traffique and Correspondency whatsoever, to be used or held with the said Rebels in the Barbada's, Bermuda's, Virginia and Antego, or either of them.''{{cn|date=September 2018}}\n\nParliamentary privateers were authorised to act against English vessels trading with these colonies: {{lang|enm|All Ships that Trade with the Rebels may be surprized. Goods and tackle of such ships not to be embezeled, till judgement in the Admiralty.; Two or three of the Officers of every ship to be examined upon oath.}}{{cn|date=September 2018}} Parliament made preparations to invade the Royalist colonies, but the outbreak of the [[Second Anglo-Dutch War]] in 1651 was to engulf the British West Indies in war with France and Holland. A thousand miles distant, Bermuda was untouched by that war and reached a compromise with Parliament.\n\nWith the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]], Bermudians found they had a powerful ally in the Crown, which had its own interest in wresting control of the English Empire from corporations like the Somers Isles Company.\n\n==Revocation of charter and dissolution==\nIt was worsening interference by the Company into the livelihoods of the islanders which led to its dissolution. A protest to the Crown resulting initially from the treatment of [[Perient Trott]] and his heirs, but expanding to include the Company's wider mismanagement of the colony, was directed to the Crown. This led to a lengthy court case in which the Crown championed Bermudians against the Company. This resulted in the Company's Royal Charter being revoked in 1684, and from then on the Crown assumed responsibility for appointing the Colony's governors (it first re-appointed the last company governor). Freed of the Company's restraints, the local merchant class came to dominate and shape Bermuda's progress, as Bermudians abandoned agriculture en masse and turned to the sea.\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Companies}}\n* [[History of Bermuda]]\n* [[History of Virginia]]\n* [[Jamestown, Virginia]]\n* [[List of trading companies]]\n* [[London Company|Virginia Company of London]]\n* [[Sea Venture]]\n* [[Virginia Company]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* Roots Web [http://www.rootsweb.com/~bmuwgw/norwoodsurvey.html Richard Norwood\u2019s Survey of the Land and Landholder\u2019s of Bermuda].\n* Bermuda Yellow Pages [http://www.bermudayp.com/history.html History of Bermuda]{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.\n* Dan Byrnes.

During the building, ''Sea Venture'''s longboat was fitted with a mast and sent to find Jamestown. Neither it, nor its crew, was ever seen again. When [[Sea Venture|''Deliverance'' and ''Patience'']] set sail for Jamestown, they left several people behind, some to maintain Somers' claim to the islands for [[Kingdom of England|England]], some dead. Those aboard the two ships included [[Sir Thomas Gates]], the military commander and future governor of Jamestown, [[William Strachey]], whose account of the wrecking may later have inspired [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] ''[[The Tempest (play)|The Tempest]]'', and [[John Rolfe]], who would found Virginia's tobacco industry, and who left a wife and child buried in Bermuda. Rolfe would find a new bride in the [[Powhatan]] princess [[Pocahontas]].\n\nJamestown, and the sixty survivors of its original five hundred settlers, were found in such a poor state that it was decided to abandon the Jamestown settlement and return everyone to England. The timely [[Jamestown supply missions|arrival of another relief fleet]] under Thomas West from England granted the colony a reprieve. However, the food shortage was made more critical by the new arrivals. Somers returned to Bermuda on ''Patience'', captained by his nephew, Matthew, to gather provisions for the Jamestown colony, but died on Bermuda in 1610.

As England began to challenge Spain's supremacy in [[Florida]] and the [[West Indies]], Spanish-speaking Blacks began to emigrate from territories taken from [[Spain]]. These immigrants arrived under the same conditions of indenture as most English immigrants, but the white majority soon became uneasy with the increasing numbers of blacks. The terms of indenture for black West Indian immigrants were consequently raised successively from seven years to ninety-nine. An attempt was also made to encourage Blacks to emigrate under threat of being enslaved. Numbers of Black slaves were also being imported to Bermuda, primarily as the result of shipwrecks, or as part of the prizes taken by [[privateers]], although Bermudian vessels went as far as Africa specifically to acquire slaves. As England's settlements in [[New England]] expanded, large areas were ethnically cleansed to make way for European expansion. This resulted in various [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]] peoples being shipped to Bermuda and sold into slavery, notably after the [[Pequot War]] and [[King Philip's War|Metacomet's War]]. A great many [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] slaves were being brought to Bermuda by other means, also, possibly from as far as [[Mexico]]. The third main minority group was composed of Irish [[Prisoner of war|prisoners-of-war]] (POW), and ethnically cleansed civilians, shipped to the Colony and sold into slavery following [[Oliver Cromwell|Cromwell's]] bloody adventure in [[Ireland]] in the 1650s (see [[Cromwellian conquest of Ireland]]). Smaller numbers of Scottish POWs were also sent as a result of Cromwell's forcing his 'protectorship' on [[Scotland]].\n\nBermuda had tended towards the [[Cavalier|Royalist]] side in the [[English Civil War]], perhaps because the shareholders of the Somers Isles Company were primarily [[Nobility|nobles]], but was largely spared the effects and the aftermath of that conflict. Bermuda's [[republic]]an element, which (as in England) was largely identical to the [[Puritan]], anti-[[Episcopal polity|episcopalian]] demographic, was forced into exile, becoming the [[Eleutheran Adventurers]] who began England's settlement of the [[Bahamas]] in the 1640s.\n\n==Economy and industry==\n[[File:Historic Bermuda Hog Money.png|thumb|right|Coins minted by the Sommer Isles Company]]\n[[Agriculture]] remained the mainstay of the [[Economic system|economy]] under the Somers Isles Company. The primary cash crop was [[tobacco]], but the quantity and quality produced were very poor. The [[Bermuda cedar]] boxes in which the tobacco was shipped to England were said to be worth more than their contents, and much of the tobacco was destroyed on arrival. The Colony also had little success with other export crops. Additionally, the several acres of arable land that had been cut from the forest meant that each farmer had only a very small area under cultivation, by comparison to the {{convert|50|acre|m2}} granted to each settler in Virginia. Bermudian farmers had to raise as many as three crops a year in order to be economically viable. This meant that they could not allow fields to lie fallow, and the soil, already high in [[Alkali#Alkaline soil|alkaline]] and low in [[magnesium]] (used by plants to form [[chlorophyll]]), became depleted. By the 1620s, Virginia's tobacco exports were increasing, and newer English colonies in the West Indies were also emulating Bermuda by focusing on growing tobacco for export, with the result of drastically reducing the profitability of growing tobacco for Bermudian farmers. Bermudian farmers increasingly turned to growing food crops and rearing livestock, both to reduce their dependence on overpriced imports, and to sell to other colonies. This growing trade created a need for Bermudian-owned ships to deliver their exports.\n\nBermudians began to turn away from agriculture quite early, building boats and developing the [[Bermuda sloop]] to pursue maritime trades. As the Company derived no income, except from tobacco sent to England aboard the company's magazine ships, it acted to stymie these activities. The building of vessels was banned without its license, and the first laws to protect the [[Bermuda cedar]], which were passed early in the seventeenth century, may have been intended more to restrict shipbuilding than to conserve the resource.\n\n==Civil War==\nBy the 1630s, the company had ceased sending Governors to Bermuda and began appointing a string of prominent Bermudians, such as [[William Sayle]], to the role. As few Adventurers actually settled in Bermuda, with their properties instead managed by poorer relatives or tenants, the local House of Assembly was necessarily elected without a property qualification, unlike the [[House of Commons of England]]. This meant it was far more concerned with the interests of the islanders, rather than the Adventurers in England. By the mid-17th century, with tobacco exports failing, many Adventurers in England eagerly cut their losses by selling their shares to the tenants who occupied. Bermudians quickly became the majority of landowners, but the Adventurers who remained in England maintained control of the Company by barring any shareholder who did not personally attend meetings in England from the decision-making process. Many of those English shareholders belonged to the [[gentry]] and anti-[[Episcopal polity|Episcopalian]] sects within the [[Church of England]], and sided with the [[Parliament of England|Parliamentarians]] during the 1642-1651 [[English Civil War|Civil War]]. Given the increasingly hostile relationship between Bermudians and the Company, the majority of Bermudians sided with the Crown. With control of the military forces in Bermuda as well as the Assembly, the Royalists deposed the Company appointed Governor, Captain Thomas Turner, and elected John Trimigham in his stead. The colony's Independents, who sided with Parliament, were forced into exile, settling the [[Bahamas]] under the Cromwell-loyalist [[William Sayle]] as the [[Eleutheran Adventurers]].\n\nThe response of Parliament to what was characterised as the rebellion of Bermuda (and of other colonies, particularly Virginia, [[Barbados]], and [[Antigua]]) was the passage of [[An Act for prohibiting Trade with the Barbadoes, Virginia, Bermuda and Antego]] in October, 1650. This called for ''due punishment [to be] inflicted upon the said Delinquents, do Declare all and every the said persons in Barbada's, Antego, Bermuda's and Virginia, that have contrived, abetted, aided or assisted those horrid Rebellions, or have since willingly joyned with them, to be notorious Robbers and Traitors, and such as by the Law of Nations are not to be permitted any maner of Commerce or Traffique with any people whatsoever; and do forbid to all maner of persons, Foreiners, and others, all maner of Commerce, Traffique and Correspondency whatsoever, to be used or held with the said Rebels in the Barbada's, Bermuda's, Virginia and Antego, or either of them.''{{cn|date=September 2018}}\n\nParliamentary privateers were authorised to act against English vessels trading with these colonies: {{lang|enm|All Ships that Trade with the Rebels may be surprized. Goods and tackle of such ships not to be embezeled, till judgement in the Admiralty.; Two or three of the Officers of every ship to be examined upon oath.}}{{cn|date=September 2018}} Parliament made preparations to invade the Royalist colonies, but the outbreak of the [[Second Anglo-Dutch War]] in 1651 was to engulf the British West Indies in war with France and Holland. A thousand miles distant, Bermuda was untouched by that war and reached a compromise with Parliament.\n\nWith the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]], Bermudians found they had a powerful ally in the Crown, which had its own interest in wresting control of the English Empire from corporations like the Somers Isles Company.\n\n==Revocation of charter and dissolution==\nIt was worsening interference by the Company into the livelihoods of the islanders which led to its dissolution. A protest to the Crown resulting initially from the treatment of [[Perient Trott]] and his heirs, but expanding to include the Company's wider mismanagement of the colony, was directed to the Crown. This led to a lengthy court case in which the Crown championed Bermudians against the Company. This resulted in the Company's Royal Charter being revoked in 1684, and from then on the Crown assumed responsibility for appointing the Colony's governors (it first re-appointed the last company governor). Freed of the Company's restraints, the local merchant class came to dominate and shape Bermuda's progress, as Bermudians abandoned agriculture en masse and turned to the sea.\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Companies}}\n* [[History of Bermuda]]\n* [[History of Virginia]]\n* [[Jamestown, Virginia]]\n* [[List of trading companies]]\n* [[London Company|Virginia Company of London]]\n* [[Sea Venture]]\n* [[Virginia Company]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* Roots Web [http://www.rootsweb.com/~bmuwgw/norwoodsurvey.html Richard Norwood\u2019s Survey of the Land and Landholder\u2019s of Bermuda].\n* Bermuda Yellow Pages [http://www.bermudayp.com/history.html History of Bermuda]{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.\n* Dan Byrnes.

In the 1950s and 1960s [[George Lovejoy]] provided commentary on Brisbane [[rugby league]] matches for the station and replaced Llewellyn as General Manager. During the Lovejoy years, the station was branded a \"Happy Day Radio\". Lovejoy was replaced in 1975 by Warren Stagg. Some of the announcers of the time were Ben Beckinsale, Russ Walkington, Ken Guy, Peter Kay, John Flemming, Jimmy White, and John Kerr. With the emergence of 4IP into the marketplace with a similar Top 40 format, 4BH added talkback programmes led by Ivor Hancock and supported by a well known lineup including, Don Seccombe, Babette Stephens, Gabby Horan, Peter Clark, Jim Iliffe, Owen Delaney, Father Stephen Freshwater, Jennifer Blocksidge and Pat Thompson. Bob Ackery joined the station in the early 1970s and became the \"drive time\" announcer before moving into the \"breakfast\" slot, later taking on the role of Programme Manager and eventually General Manager in the late 80s. He took over from Barry Augustus, who led the station through one of its most successful periods through the late 70s and 1980s. This included a frequency change from 1390&nbsp;kHz to 880&nbsp;kHz in the mid 1970s and from 880&nbsp;kHz to 882&nbsp;kHz on 23 November 1978, a relocation of the Transmitter from Bald Hills to Wynnum West and a move from its old Adelaide Street home to purpose built studios at Astor Terrace Spring Hill.\n\nIn 1988, the station was sold to a local consortium.\n\nIn 1975, 4BH started broadcasting \"Beautiful Music\", which became their focus except for a period in 1994 when the station converted to talk which was up against 4BH's now sister station 4BC and 612 4QR Brisbane. The station successfully bid for an FM license (conversion) in 1990 but was unable to afford the conversion. 4KQ was the second-highest bidder but also failed to produce the required money. In 1995, after the disastrous Talk format experiment, 4BH was placed in receivership and bought for just over $2 million by Michael Norris who was a Brisbane businessman and the major shareholder of Unitel and the Ipswich and West Moreton Broadcasting Corp. 4BH was relocated from [[Spring Hill, Queensland|Spring Hill]] to shared studios at the 106.9 QFM building in [[North Ipswich, Queensland|North Ipswich]] (now [[River 94.9]]).\n\nBetween 1995 and 1997, 4BH returned to the top two ratings position. In January 1997 Michael Norris sold 4BH to the [[Australian Radio Network]] (owners of 4KQ) for over $11.5 million, who owned 4BH until January 2002 after ARN and [[DMG Radio Australia]] jointly launched [[97.3 FM (Brisbane)|97.3 FM]], so ARN sold 4BH to DMG and in February 2003, 4BH was sold yet again to [[Southern Cross Broadcasting]] because DMG had won an auction to set up an FM service on the Sunshine Coast.<ref>{{cite news | title = Business: ARN pays $11m for 4BH to Increase Radio Interest.| first = Rhyll | last = Cronin | page = 27 | newspaper = [[The Courier-Mail]] | date = 29 January 1997 | url = }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | title = FM Partner Buys 4BH From ARN| first = Cosima | last = Marriner | page = 23 | newspaper = [[Sydney Morning Herald]] | date = 25 January 2002 | accessdate = 17 April 2010 | url = http://newsstore.fairfax.com.au/apps/viewDocument.ac?docID=SMH020125BLLG31FTHRE}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | title = Finance: Southern Cross increases its Brisbane radio share.| first = Scott  | last = Murdoch | page = 37 | newspaper = [[The Courier-Mail]]  | date = 14 February 2003 | url = }}</ref>\n\nIn August 2002, the station's [[Antenna (radio)|transmitting antenna]] in [[Wynnum West, Queensland|Wynnum West]] was felled by vandals, causing the station to go off air.<ref>{{cite news | title = Vandals halt radio service.| first = | last = | page = 6 | newspaper =  [[Wynnum Herald]] |publisher = [[Quest Community Newspapers]] | date = 21 August 2002  | url = }}</ref> The station returned to air a few days later on low power.

In 1995, after the disastrous Talk format experiment, 4BH was placed in receivership and bought for just over $2 million by Michael Norris who was a Brisbane businessman and the major shareholder of Unitel and the Ipswich and West Moreton Broadcasting Corp. 4BH was relocated from [[Spring Hill, Queensland|Spring Hill]] to shared studios at the 106.9 QFM building in [[North Ipswich, Queensland|North Ipswich]] (now [[River 94.9]]).\n\nBetween 1995 and 1997, 4BH returned to the top two ratings position. In January 1997 Michael Norris sold 4BH to the [[Australian Radio Network]] (owners of 4KQ) for over $11.5 million, who owned 4BH until January 2002 after ARN and [[DMG Radio Australia]] jointly launched [[97.3 FM (Brisbane)|97.3 FM]], so ARN sold 4BH to DMG and in February 2003, 4BH was sold yet again to [[Southern Cross Broadcasting]] because DMG had won an auction to set up an FM service on the Sunshine Coast.<ref>{{cite news | title = Business: ARN pays $11m for 4BH to Increase Radio Interest.| first = Rhyll | last = Cronin | page = 27 | newspaper = [[The Courier-Mail]] | date = 29 January 1997 | url = }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | title = FM Partner Buys 4BH From ARN| first = Cosima | last = Marriner | page = 23 | newspaper = [[Sydney Morning Herald]] | date = 25 January 2002 | accessdate = 17 April 2010 | url = http://newsstore.fairfax.com.au/apps/viewDocument.ac?docID=SMH020125BLLG31FTHRE}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | title = Finance: Southern Cross increases its Brisbane radio share.| first = Scott  | last = Murdoch | page = 37 | newspaper = [[The Courier-Mail]]  | date = 14 February 2003 | url = }}</ref>\n\nIn August 2002, the station's [[Antenna (radio)|transmitting antenna]] in [[Wynnum West, Queensland|Wynnum West]] was felled by vandals, causing the station to go off air.<ref>{{cite news | title = Vandals halt radio service.| first = | last = | page = 6 | newspaper =  [[Wynnum Herald]] |publisher = [[Quest Community Newspapers]] | date = 21 August 2002  | url = }}</ref> The station returned to air a few days later on low power.

Botha ''et al.'' (2007) seems to have followed Owen (1861), but without specifying taxonomic rank.<ref>R. Broom. 1913. A revision of the reptiles of the Karroo.

Other basal cynodonts were the [[Procynosuchidae|procynosuchids]], a family that includes ''[[Procynosuchus]]'' and ''[[Dvinia]]''. Cynodonts were among the few groups of synapsids that survived the [[Permian\u2013Triassic extinction event]] and had a slow recovery after the extinction.\n\nThe most derived cynodonts are found within the [[clade]] [[Eucynodontia]], which also contains the members of [[Mammal]]ia. Representative genera of nonmammalian cynodonts include the large [[carnivorous]] [[Cynognathus|cynognathids]], the equally large herbivorous [[Traversodontidae|traversodont]]s, and the small mammal-like [[Tritylodontidae|tritylodontid]]s and [[ictidosaur]]s. The presence of [[Evolution of mammals#Respiratory turbinates|respiratory turbinates]] suggests a rapid metabolism and possibly [[endotherm]]y.\n\nDuring their [[evolution]], the number of cynodont [[jaw]] bones reduced. This move towards a single bone for the mandible paved the way for other bones in the jaw, the [[articular]] and [[Angular bone|angular]], to migrate to the cranium, where they function as parts of the mammalian hearing system.\n\nCynodonts also developed a [[secondary palate]] in the roof of the mouth. This caused air flow from the nostrils to travel to a position in the back of the mouth instead of directly through it, allowing cynodonts to chew and breathe at the same time. This characteristic is present in all mammals.\n\n==Characteristics==\n[[Image:Bienotherium yunnanense.JPG|thumb|right|''Bienotherium yunnanense'']]\nEarly cynodonts have many of the skeletal characteristics of [[mammal]]s. The teeth were fully differentiated and the braincase bulged at the back of the head. Outside of some [[Crown group|crown-group]] mammals (notably the [[theria]]ns), all cynodonts probably laid eggs. The [[temporal fenestrae#Fenestrae|temporal fenestrae]] were much larger than those of their ancestors, and the widening of the [[zygomatic arch]] in a more mammal-like skull would have allowed for more robust jaw musculature. They also have the [[secondary palate]] that other primitive therapsids lacked, except the [[therocephalians]], who were the closest relatives of cynodonts. (However, the secondary palate of cynodonts primarily comprises the maxillae and palatines as in mammals, whereas the secondary palate of the therocephalians primarily comprises the maxillae and the vomer.) The [[dentary]] was the largest bone in their lower jaw.\n\nThe cynodonts probably had some form of [[warm-blooded]] metabolism. This has led to many reconstructions of cynodonts as having [[fur]]. Being endothermic they may have needed it for [[thermoregulation]], but fossil evidence of their fur (or lack thereof) has been elusive. Modern mammals have [[Harderian gland]]s secreting lipids to coat their fur, but the telltale imprint of this structure is only found from the [[mammaliformes|primitive mammal]] ''[[Morganucodon]]'' and onwards.<ref name=Fur>{{cite journal| last1=Ruben|first1= J.A. |last2= Jones| first2= T.D. |year=2000|title= Selective Factors Associated with the Origin of Fur and Feathers |journal=American Zoologist|volume= 40|pages= 585\u2013596 |url=https://az.oxfordjournals.org/content/40/4/585| doi = 10.1093/icb/40.4.585 | issue=4|doi-access= free}}</ref> Nonetheless, recent studies on [[Permian]] synapsid [[coprolite]]s show that more basal therapsids had fur,<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/let.12156 | title=Microbiota and food residues including possible evidence of pre-mammalian hair in Upper Permian coprolites from Russia | journal=Lethaia | year=2015 | last1 = Bajdek | first1 = Piotr}}</ref> and at any rate fur was already present in [[Mammaliaformes]] such as ''[[Castorocauda]]'' and ''[[Megaconus]]''.\n\nMarks in the upper and lower jaw of cynodonts have been interpreted as channels that supplied blood vessels and nerves to [[whiskers]].<ref name=Brink>{{Cite journal| last=Brink | first=A.S. | title=A study on the skeleton of ''Diademodon'' | journal=Palaeontologia Africana | volume=3 | pages=3\u201339 |year=1955 }}</ref><ref name=Kemp>{{Cite book| last=Kemp | first=T.S. | title=Mammal-like reptiles and the origin of mammals | publisher=Academic Press | year=1982 | location=London | pages=363| isbn=0-12-404120-5}}</ref> Whiskers may have been typical of cynodontia as a whole, or have evolved in this group.\n\nDerived cynodonts developed [[epipubic]] bones. These served to strengthen the torso and support abdominal and hindlimb musculature, aiding them in the development of an erect gait, but at the expense of prolonged pregnancy, forcing these animals to give birth to highly altricial young as in modern [[marsupials]] and [[monotremes]]. Only [[placentals]], and perhaps ''[[Megazostrodon]]'' and ''[[Erythrotherium]]'', would lose these.<ref>Michael L. Power, Jay Schulkin.

[[William King Gregory]] (1910), Broom (1913), Carroll (1988), Gauthier ''et al.'' (1989), Hopson and Kitching (2001) and Botha ''et al.'' (2007) all considered Cynodontia as belonging to Therapsida. Botha ''et al.'' (2007) seems to have followed Owen (1861), but without specifying taxonomic rank.<ref>R. Broom. 1913. A revision of the reptiles of the Karroo.

Other basal cynodonts were the [[Procynosuchidae|procynosuchids]], a family that includes ''[[Procynosuchus]]'' and ''[[Dvinia]]''. Cynodonts were among the few groups of synapsids that survived the [[Permian\u2013Triassic extinction event]] and had a slow recovery after the extinction.\n\nThe most derived cynodonts are found within the [[clade]] [[Eucynodontia]], which also contains the members of [[Mammal]]ia. Representative genera of nonmammalian cynodonts include the large [[carnivorous]] [[Cynognathus|cynognathids]], the equally large herbivorous [[Traversodontidae|traversodont]]s, and the small mammal-like [[Tritylodontidae|tritylodontid]]s and [[ictidosaur]]s. The presence of [[Evolution of mammals#Respiratory turbinates|respiratory turbinates]] suggests a rapid metabolism and possibly [[endotherm]]y.\n\nDuring their [[evolution]], the number of cynodont [[jaw]] bones reduced. This move towards a single bone for the mandible paved the way for other bones in the jaw, the [[articular]] and [[Angular bone|angular]], to migrate to the cranium, where they function as parts of the mammalian hearing system.\n\nCynodonts also developed a [[secondary palate]] in the roof of the mouth. This caused air flow from the nostrils to travel to a position in the back of the mouth instead of directly through it, allowing cynodonts to chew and breathe at the same time. This characteristic is present in all mammals.\n\n==Characteristics==\n[[Image:Bienotherium yunnanense.JPG|thumb|right|''Bienotherium yunnanense'']]\nEarly cynodonts have many of the skeletal characteristics of [[mammal]]s. The teeth were fully differentiated and the braincase bulged at the back of the head. Outside of some [[Crown group|crown-group]] mammals (notably the [[theria]]ns), all cynodonts probably laid eggs. The [[temporal fenestrae#Fenestrae|temporal fenestrae]] were much larger than those of their ancestors, and the widening of the [[zygomatic arch]] in a more mammal-like skull would have allowed for more robust jaw musculature. They also have the [[secondary palate]] that other primitive therapsids lacked, except the [[therocephalians]], who were the closest relatives of cynodonts. (However, the secondary palate of cynodonts primarily comprises the maxillae and palatines as in mammals, whereas the secondary palate of the therocephalians primarily comprises the maxillae and the vomer.) The [[dentary]] was the largest bone in their lower jaw.\n\nThe cynodonts probably had some form of [[warm-blooded]] metabolism. This has led to many reconstructions of cynodonts as having [[fur]]. Being endothermic they may have needed it for [[thermoregulation]], but fossil evidence of their fur (or lack thereof) has been elusive. Modern mammals have [[Harderian gland]]s secreting lipids to coat their fur, but the telltale imprint of this structure is only found from the [[mammaliformes|primitive mammal]] ''[[Morganucodon]]'' and onwards.<ref name=Fur>{{cite journal| last1=Ruben|first1= J.A. |last2= Jones| first2= T.D. |year=2000|title= Selective Factors Associated with the Origin of Fur and Feathers |journal=American Zoologist|volume= 40|pages= 585\u2013596 |url=https://az.oxfordjournals.org/content/40/4/585| doi = 10.1093/icb/40.4.585 | issue=4|doi-access= free}}</ref> Nonetheless, recent studies on [[Permian]] synapsid [[coprolite]]s show that more basal therapsids had fur,<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/let.12156 | title=Microbiota and food residues including possible evidence of pre-mammalian hair in Upper Permian coprolites from Russia | journal=Lethaia | year=2015 | last1 = Bajdek | first1 = Piotr}}</ref> and at any rate fur was already present in [[Mammaliaformes]] such as ''[[Castorocauda]]'' and ''[[Megaconus]]''.\n\nMarks in the upper and lower jaw of cynodonts have been interpreted as channels that supplied blood vessels and nerves to [[whiskers]].<ref name=Brink>{{Cite journal| last=Brink | first=A.S. | title=A study on the skeleton of ''Diademodon'' | journal=Palaeontologia Africana | volume=3 | pages=3\u201339 |year=1955 }}</ref><ref name=Kemp>{{Cite book| last=Kemp | first=T.S. | title=Mammal-like reptiles and the origin of mammals | publisher=Academic Press | year=1982 | location=London | pages=363| isbn=0-12-404120-5}}</ref> Whiskers may have been typical of cynodontia as a whole, or have evolved in this group.\n\nDerived cynodonts developed [[epipubic]] bones. These served to strengthen the torso and support abdominal and hindlimb musculature, aiding them in the development of an erect gait, but at the expense of prolonged pregnancy, forcing these animals to give birth to highly altricial young as in modern [[marsupials]] and [[monotremes]]. Only [[placentals]], and perhaps ''[[Megazostrodon]]'' and ''[[Erythrotherium]]'', would lose these.<ref>Michael L. Power, Jay Schulkin.

Widely regarded as the greatest Guyanese poet, and one of the most important poets of the Caribbean region, Carter is best known for his poems of protest, resistance and revolution.{{sfn|Brown|2006}}{{sfn|Robinson|2005|p=36}}{{sfn|Brown|1986|108}}{{sfn|Robinson|2006b|p=15}} He played an active role in Guyanese politics, particularly in the years leading up [[History of Guyana#Independence and the Burnham era|Independence]] in 1966 and those immediately following. He was famously imprisoned by the British government in Guyana (then [[British Guiana]]) in October 1953 under allegations of \"spreading dissension\", and again in June 1954 for taking part in a [[People's Progressive Party (Guyana)|PPP]] procession.{{sfn|Robinson|2006b|p=28-9}}{{sfn|Gafoor|2008}}  Shortly after being released from prison the first time, he published his best-known poetry collection, ''Poems of Resistance from British Guiana'' (1954).{{sfn|Brown|1986|p=109}}{{sfn|Robinson|2006a}}\n\n== Life ==\nMartin Carter was born in [[Georgetown, Guyana|Georgetown]] in what was then [[British Guiana]] (now [[Guyana]]) to Victor Emmanuel and Violet Eugene Carter (''n\u00e9e'' Wylde) on 7 June 1927.{{sfn|Robinson|2006a|p=11}} He was one of seven siblings. From 1938 to 1947 he attended [[Queen's College, Guyana|Queen's College]] school, in Georgetown.{{sfn|Robinson|2006b|p=19}} On leaving Queen's College, Carter decided not to go to university and, instead, joined the civil service where he worked for the Post Office and then for the Prison Service.{{sfn|Robinson|2006b|p=19\u201320}}{{sfn|Seecharan|2000|p=27}} The year 1948 saw the first publication of Carter's poetry, when a \"fragment\" of his poem \"An Ode to Midnight\" was printed in [[A. J. Seymour]]'s literary journal ''[[Kyk-Over-Al (magazine)|Kyk-Over-Al]]''.{{sfn|Robinson|2006b|p=17}} In 1950 Carter became one of the founding members of the socialist and anti-colonial [[People's Progressive Party (Guyana)|People's Progressive Party]] (PPP), led by [[Cheddi Jagan]].{{sfn|Robinson|2006a|p=11}} {{sfn|Paddington|1995}} He published his second poem, \"The Indian Woman\", in the same year, in the PPP journal ''Thunder'' (under the pseudonym M. Black).{{sfn|Robinson|2006a|p=21}} Carter married Phyllis Howard in 1953, and their first child, Keith, was born later that year. {{sfn|Robinson|2006b|p=27}}\n\nIn 1953, Carter left the civil service and stood for the PPP in [[History of Guyana#The First PPP Government|the first universal suffrage elections in British Guiana]].{{sfn|Robinson|2006a}} He was not elected, but the PPP won a convincing victory. In October 1953, following the British government's declaration of a State of Emergency in Guyana, he was arrested and detained without charge at a US airbase in [[Timehri]] on suspicion that he was \"spreading dissension\", along with [[Eusi Kwayana]] and Cheddi Jagan.{{sfn|Dalleo|2011|p=165}}{{sfn|Brown|1986}}{{sfn|Trevis|1989|p=68}} While detained, Carter took part in a one-month hunger strike, beginning on 23 November, organised by the detainees as a protest against the injustices of the government and their being held, indefinitely, without charge.{{sfn|Robinson|2006b|p=28}} He remained in prison until January 1954, when he was released under orders not to leave Georgetown.{{sfn|Robinson|2006b|p=29}} The restriction orders placed upon him lasted until 1957. In May 1954, ''Poems of Resistance from British Guiana'' was published in London by the Marxist publishing house [[Lawrence and Wishart]], making Carter one of the first Caribbean poets to be published outside of the Caribbean.{{sfn|Robinson|2005|p=43}}{{sfn|Robinson|2006b|p=29}} In June 1954 he was arrested once again for taking part in a PPP procession, and was imprisoned for six months, until December that year. {{sfn|Robinson|2006b|p=29}} His second child, Sonia, was born shortly after his release.{{sfn|Robinson|2006a|p=11}}\n\nWhen disagreement in the PPP led to a split in the party and the founding of a rival party, the [[People's National Congress (Guyana)|People's National Congress]] (PNC) (under [[Forbes Burnham]]) in 1955, Carter chose to remain with the PPP. {{sfn|Robinson|2006b|p=29}} This would not last long, however: just a year later, in 1956, he was expelled from the PPP for being an \"ultra-leftist\". {{sfn|Robinson|2006b|p=29}}{{sfn|Anonymous}} After leaving the PPP, he worked briefly as an information officer in the British Council's Georgetown Office, and then for a longer period (1959\u201367) as an Information Officer for [[Booker Group|Booker]] (a multinational company and owner of Guyana's sugar estates).{{sfn|Anonymous}} Following the declaration of Guyana's Independence in May 1966, he resigned from Booker and joined the PNC as Minister of Information and Culture in 1967.{{sfn|Robinson|2006b|p=37}} In 1966\u201367 he represented Guyana at the United Nations.{{sfn|Brown|1986|p=109}} Concerned about the way in which the PNC government was developing, he resigned from this position, and indeed from governmental politics, in November 1970, remarking that he wished to live \"simply as a poet, remaining with the people\".{{sfn|Anonymous|1970|p=1|ps=. Cited in Robinson 2006a, p. 16}} From 1970 to 1978, he returned to Booker once again, resigning for the last time in 1978 to become a lecturer in creative writing and artist in residence at the [[University of Guyana]].{{sfn|Robinson|2006a|p=12}} During this time, he wrote ''Poems of Succession'', which was published in 1977 by [[New Beacon Books]]. In 1978 he was badly beaten when he took part in a demonstration against the PNC and their refusal to hold elections.{{sfn|Anonymous}} Politically, his sympathy lay with the [[Working People's Alliance]] of [[Eusi Kwayana]] and [[Walter Rodney]] during this time, although he never became a party member.{{sfn|Paddington|1995}}\n\nIn 1992 Carter took part in a Guyanese Writers Tour, in the UK, with [[Wilson Harris]], [[Fred D'Aguiar]] and [[Grace Nichols]].{{sfn|Robinson|2006a|p=13}}{{sfn|Brown|2006}} In 1993 Carter suffered a stroke and lost the ability to walk and talk.{{sfn|Robinson|2006a|p=13}} He died on 13 December 1997, survived by his wife and their four children. He was buried at the Place of Heroes in the [[Guyana Botanical Gardens|Botanical Gardens]] in Georgetown, an honour that had previously been reserved for Heads of State.{{sfn|Roopnaraine|2000|p=55}}\n\n== Poetry and critical reception ==\nHis collection ''Poems of Resistance'', published in 1954, established his reputation as a powerful moral and political voice.\n\nLong seen as primarily a poet who touched on themes of politics, resistance, and protest, his later poems were often highly personal. He is best known, however, for a powerful protest poem of the 1960s, \"I come from the nigger yard of yesterday\".<ref>Andrew Stone, [http://www.socialistreview.org.uk/article.php?articlenumber=9778 \"Inspiring Poetry \u2013 Review of ''University of Hunger''], ''Socialist Review''.</ref>\n\nAt the [[Live from Lincoln Center]] jazz concert for the victims of [[Hurricane Katrina]], [[Danny Glover]] quoted some lines of Carter's, bringing him to public attention in North America for the first time in the twenty-first century.{{sfn|Belafonte}}\n\n==Select bibliography==\n* ''The Hill of Fire Glows Red'', Miniature Poets, 1951.\n* ''The Kind Eagle'', privately printed, 1952.\n* ''The Hidden Man'', privately printed, 1952.\n* ''Poems of Resistance from British Guiana'', Lawrence and Wishart, 1954.\n* ''Poems of Shape and Motion'', privately printed, 1955.\n* ''Jail Me Quickly'', privately printed, 1963.\n* ''Poems of Succession'', New Beacon, 1977.\n* ''Poems of Affinity'', Release, 1980.\n* ''Selected Poems'', Demerara, 1989.\n* ''University of Hunger: Collected Poems and Selected Prose''.

Widely regarded as the greatest Guyanese poet, and one of the most important poets of the Caribbean region, Carter is best known for his poems of protest, resistance and revolution.{{sfn|Brown|2006}}{{sfn|Robinson|2005|p=36}}{{sfn|Brown|1986|108}}{{sfn|Robinson|2006b|p=15}} He played an active role in Guyanese politics, particularly in the years leading up [[History of Guyana#Independence and the Burnham era|Independence]] in 1966 and those immediately following. He was famously imprisoned by the British government in Guyana (then [[British Guiana]]) in October 1953 under allegations of \"spreading dissension\", and again in June 1954 for taking part in a [[People's Progressive Party (Guyana)|PPP]] procession.{{sfn|Robinson|2006b|p=28-9}}{{sfn|Gafoor|2008}}  Shortly after being released from prison the first time, he published his best-known poetry collection, ''Poems of Resistance from British Guiana'' (1954).{{sfn|Brown|1986|p=109}}{{sfn|Robinson|2006a}}\n\n== Life ==\nMartin Carter was born in [[Georgetown, Guyana|Georgetown]] in what was then [[British Guiana]] (now [[Guyana]]) to Victor Emmanuel and Violet Eugene Carter (''n\u00e9e'' Wylde) on 7 June 1927.{{sfn|Robinson|2006a|p=11}} He was one of seven siblings. From 1938 to 1947 he attended [[Queen's College, Guyana|Queen's College]] school, in Georgetown.{{sfn|Robinson|2006b|p=19}} On leaving Queen's College, Carter decided not to go to university and, instead, joined the civil service where he worked for the Post Office and then for the Prison Service.{{sfn|Robinson|2006b|p=19\u201320}}{{sfn|Seecharan|2000|p=27}} The year 1948 saw the first publication of Carter's poetry, when a \"fragment\" of his poem \"An Ode to Midnight\" was printed in [[A. J. Seymour]]'s literary journal ''[[Kyk-Over-Al (magazine)|Kyk-Over-Al]]''.{{sfn|Robinson|2006b|p=17}} In 1950 Carter became one of the founding members of the socialist and anti-colonial [[People's Progressive Party (Guyana)|People's Progressive Party]] (PPP), led by [[Cheddi Jagan]].{{sfn|Robinson|2006a|p=11}} {{sfn|Paddington|1995}} He published his second poem, \"The Indian Woman\", in the same year, in the PPP journal ''Thunder'' (under the pseudonym M. Black).{{sfn|Robinson|2006a|p=21}} Carter married Phyllis Howard in 1953, and their first child, Keith, was born later that year. {{sfn|Robinson|2006b|p=27}}\n\nIn 1953, Carter left the civil service and stood for the PPP in [[History of Guyana#The First PPP Government|the first universal suffrage elections in British Guiana]].{{sfn|Robinson|2006a}} He was not elected, but the PPP won a convincing victory. In October 1953, following the British government's declaration of a State of Emergency in Guyana, he was arrested and detained without charge at a US airbase in [[Timehri]] on suspicion that he was \"spreading dissension\", along with [[Eusi Kwayana]] and Cheddi Jagan.{{sfn|Dalleo|2011|p=165}}{{sfn|Brown|1986}}{{sfn|Trevis|1989|p=68}} While detained, Carter took part in a one-month hunger strike, beginning on 23 November, organised by the detainees as a protest against the injustices of the government and their being held, indefinitely, without charge.{{sfn|Robinson|2006b|p=28}} He remained in prison until January 1954, when he was released under orders not to leave Georgetown.{{sfn|Robinson|2006b|p=29}} The restriction orders placed upon him lasted until 1957. In May 1954, ''Poems of Resistance from British Guiana'' was published in London by the Marxist publishing house [[Lawrence and Wishart]], making Carter one of the first Caribbean poets to be published outside of the Caribbean.{{sfn|Robinson|2005|p=43}}{{sfn|Robinson|2006b|p=29}} In June 1954 he was arrested once again for taking part in a PPP procession, and was imprisoned for six months, until December that year. {{sfn|Robinson|2006b|p=29}} His second child, Sonia, was born shortly after his release.{{sfn|Robinson|2006a|p=11}}\n\nWhen disagreement in the PPP led to a split in the party and the founding of a rival party, the [[People's National Congress (Guyana)|People's National Congress]] (PNC) (under [[Forbes Burnham]]) in 1955, Carter chose to remain with the PPP. {{sfn|Robinson|2006b|p=29}} This would not last long, however: just a year later, in 1956, he was expelled from the PPP for being an \"ultra-leftist\". {{sfn|Robinson|2006b|p=29}}{{sfn|Anonymous}} After leaving the PPP, he worked briefly as an information officer in the British Council's Georgetown Office, and then for a longer period (1959\u201367) as an Information Officer for [[Booker Group|Booker]] (a multinational company and owner of Guyana's sugar estates).{{sfn|Anonymous}} Following the declaration of Guyana's Independence in May 1966, he resigned from Booker and joined the PNC as Minister of Information and Culture in 1967.{{sfn|Robinson|2006b|p=37}} In 1966\u201367 he represented Guyana at the United Nations.{{sfn|Brown|1986|p=109}} Concerned about the way in which the PNC government was developing, he resigned from this position, and indeed from governmental politics, in November 1970, remarking that he wished to live \"simply as a poet, remaining with the people\".{{sfn|Anonymous|1970|p=1|ps=. Cited in Robinson 2006a, p. 16}} From 1970 to 1978, he returned to Booker once again, resigning for the last time in 1978 to become a lecturer in creative writing and artist in residence at the [[University of Guyana]].{{sfn|Robinson|2006a|p=12}} During this time, he wrote ''Poems of Succession'', which was published in 1977 by [[New Beacon Books]]. In 1978 he was badly beaten when he took part in a demonstration against the PNC and their refusal to hold elections.{{sfn|Anonymous}} Politically, his sympathy lay with the [[Working People's Alliance]] of [[Eusi Kwayana]] and [[Walter Rodney]] during this time, although he never became a party member.{{sfn|Paddington|1995}}\n\nIn 1992 Carter took part in a Guyanese Writers Tour, in the UK, with [[Wilson Harris]], [[Fred D'Aguiar]] and [[Grace Nichols]].{{sfn|Robinson|2006a|p=13}}{{sfn|Brown|2006}} In 1993 Carter suffered a stroke and lost the ability to walk and talk.{{sfn|Robinson|2006a|p=13}} He died on 13 December 1997, survived by his wife and their four children. He was buried at the Place of Heroes in the Botanical Gardens in Georgetown, an honour that had previously been reserved for Heads of State.{{sfn|Roopnaraine|2000|p=55}}\n\n== Poetry and critical reception ==\nHis collection ''Poems of Resistance'', published in 1954, established his reputation as a powerful moral and political voice.\n\nLong seen as primarily a poet who touched on themes of politics, resistance, and protest, his later poems were often highly personal. He is best known, however, for a powerful protest poem of the 1960s, \"I come from the nigger yard of yesterday\".<ref>Andrew Stone, [http://www.socialistreview.org.uk/article.php?articlenumber=9778 \"Inspiring Poetry \u2013 Review of ''University of Hunger''], ''Socialist Review''.</ref>\n\nAt the [[Live from Lincoln Center]] jazz concert for the victims of [[Hurricane Katrina]], [[Danny Glover]] quoted some lines of Carter's, bringing him to public attention in North America for the first time in the twenty-first century.{{sfn|Belafonte}}\n\n==Select bibliography==\n* ''The Hill of Fire Glows Red'', Miniature Poets, 1951.\n* ''The Kind Eagle'', privately printed, 1952.\n* ''The Hidden Man'', privately printed, 1952.\n* ''Poems of Resistance from British Guiana'', Lawrence and Wishart, 1954.\n* ''Poems of Shape and Motion'', privately printed, 1955.\n* ''Jail Me Quickly'', privately printed, 1963.\n* ''Poems of Succession'', New Beacon, 1977.\n* ''Poems of Affinity'', Release, 1980.\n* ''Selected Poems'', Demerara, 1989.\n* ''University of Hunger: Collected Poems and Selected Prose''.
