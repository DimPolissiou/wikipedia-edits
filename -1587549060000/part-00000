After the war Bhavsinhji realised the reason for repeated attack was the location of Sihor.  In 1723, he established a new capital near [[Vadva]] village, 20&nbsp;km away from Sihor, and named it Bhavnagar after himself.  It was a carefully chosen strategic location because of its potential for maritime trade. Naturally, Bhavnagar became the capital of Bhavnagar State. In 1807, Bhavnagar State became a [[British protectorate]].<ref name=\"Dosabhai\">{{cite book|last=Dos\u00e1bhai|first=Edalji\n|title=A History of Gujarat from the Earliest Period to the Present Time|url=https://archive.org/details/ahistorygujartf00dosgoog|publisher=United Print and General Agency|year=1894| page=[https://archive.org/details/ahistorygujartf00dosgoog/page/n219 177]}}</ref><ref>[http://www.worldstatesmen.org/India_princes_A-J.html Princely States of India]</ref>\n\nThe old town of Bhavnagar was a fortified town with gates leading to other important regional towns. It remained a major port for almost two centuries, trading commodities with Mozambique, [[Zanzibar]], Singapore, and the [[Persian Gulf]].\n\nBhavsinhji ensured that Bhavnagar benefited from the revenue that was brought in from maritime trade, which was monopolised by Surat and Cambay. As the castle of Surat was under the control of the Sidis of Janjira, Bhavsinhji brokered an agreement with them, giving the Sidis 1.25% of the revenue by Bhavnagar port. Bhavsinhji entered into a similar agreement with the British when they took over Surat in 1856. Whilst Bhavsinhji was in power, Bhavnagar grew from a small chieftainship to a considerably important state. This was due to the addition of new territories as well as the income provided by maritime trade. Bhavsinhji's successors continued to encourage maritime trade through Bhavnagar port, recognising its importance to the state. The territory was further expanded by Bhavsinhji's grandson, Vakhatsinhji Gohil when he took possession of lands belonging to [[Kolis]] and Kathis, obtained Rajula from the Navab Saheb Ahmad Khan, and merged Ghogha Taluka into the state. In 1793, Vakhatsinhji conquered the forts of Chital and Talaja, and later conquered Mahuva, Kundla, Trapaj, Umrala and Botad. Bhavnagar remained the main port of the state, with Mahuva and Ghogha also becoming important ports. Because of the maritime trade, the state prospered compared to other states. During the late 19th century, the [[Bhavnagar State Railway]] was constructed. This made Bhavnagar the first state that was able to construct its railway system without any aid from the central government, which was mentioned in the [[Imperial Gazetteer]]. Mr Peile, a political agent, described the state as follows: \"With flourishing finances and much good work in progress. Of financial matters I need say little; you have no debts, and your treasury is full.\"<ref>{{cite book | title=Poverty and un-British rule in Inda | publisher=Low Price Publications | author=Naoroji, Dadabhai | year=1990 | pages=229}}</ref> Between 1870 and 1878 the state was put under joint administration, due to the fact that Prince [[Takhtsinhji]] was a minor. This period produced some notable reforms in the areas of administration, revenue collection, judiciary, [[Postal, telegraph and telephone service|the post and telegraph services]], and economic policy. The ports were also modernised. The two people who were responsible for those reforms were Mr E. H. Percival of the [[Bombay Civil Service]] and [[Gaurishankar Udayshankar]], Chief Minister of Bhavnagar State Bhavngar Boroz.\n\nIn 1911, HH Maharani Nundkanvarba of Bhavnagar, was awarded the [[Order of the Crown of India]], the highest Imperial award for women of the Empire. The former princely state of Bhavnagar was also known as Gohilwad; \"Land of the Gohils\" (the clan of the ruling family).\n\n===Merger with the Indian Union in 1947===\nIn 1947, the Deputy Prime Minister of the newly independent [[Dominion of India|Indian Union]], [[Vallabhbhai Patel]], undertook the process of [[political integration of India|unifying]] 565 princely states with the Union. The last Maharaja of Bhavnagar, [[Krishna Kumarasingh Bhavasingh]] handed over the administration of his [[Bombay State]] to the people's representative in 1948.\n\nThe erstwhile royal family of Bhavnagar continues to lead an active role in the public eye as well as in business (hotels, real-estate, agriculture and ship-breaking) and is held in high regard by the population both in the city as well as areas that comprised the former princely state of Bhavanagar.<ref>http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/rajkot/Bhavnagar-kings-sacrifice-to-feature-in-school-textbook/articleshow/10585349.cms</ref>\n\n==Rulers==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

In 1723, he established a new capital near [[Vadva]] village, 20&nbsp;km away from Sihor, and named it Bhavnagar after himself.  It was a carefully chosen strategic location because of its potential for maritime trade. Naturally, Bhavnagar became the capital of Bhavnagar State. In 1807, Bhavnagar State became a [[British protectorate]].<ref name=\"Dosabhai\">{{cite book|last=Dos\u00e1bhai|first=Edalji\n|title=A History of Gujarat from the Earliest Period to the Present Time|url=https://archive.org/details/ahistorygujartf00dosgoog|publisher=United Print and General Agency|year=1894| page=[https://archive.org/details/ahistorygujartf00dosgoog/page/n219 177]}}</ref><ref>[http://www.worldstatesmen.org/India_princes_A-J.html Princely States of India]</ref>\n\nThe old town of Bhavnagar was a fortified town with gates leading to other important regional towns. It remained a major port for almost two centuries, trading commodities with Mozambique, [[Zanzibar]], Singapore, and the [[Persian Gulf]].\n\nBhavsinhji ensured that Bhavnagar benefited from the revenue that was brought in from maritime trade, which was monopolised by Surat and Cambay. As the castle of Surat was under the control of the Sidis of Janjira, Bhavsinhji brokered an agreement with them, giving the Sidis 1.25% of the revenue by Bhavnagar port. Bhavsinhji entered into a similar agreement with the British when they took over Surat in 1856.

{"title_page": "William Whitley", "text_new": "'''William Whitley''' (August 4, 1749 \u2013 October 5, 1813), was an [[United States|American]] [[settler|pioneer]] in what became Kentucky, in the colonial and early Federal period. Born in Virginia, he was the son of immigrants from northern Ireland. He was important to the early settlement of the [[Commonwealth (U.S. state)|U.S. Commonwealth]] of [[Kentucky]], where he moved with his family from Virginia. He served with the Kentucky militia during the [[Northwest Indian War]]. \n\nHe was married and his eleven children lived to adulthood, settling as far West as Oregon. At the age of 64, Whitley signed up to serve in the [[War of 1812]]. He was killed in Canada at the [[Battle of the Thames]]; some accounts credit him with killing [[Tecumseh]], a [[Shawnee]] leader allied with the British. \n\n==Early life and family==\nWilliam Whitley was the son of Solomon Whitley and Elizabeth Barnett, immigrants from Ireland who settled in [[Augusta County, Virginia]]. (They were likely from [[Northern Ireland]] and [[Protestant]].) He was the oldest of four sons and is thought to have had five sisters as well.\n\nAbout 1771 or as late as 1775, Whitley married Esther Fullen, also from Virginia.<ref name=bc273/> A few years later, he proposed that they move from Virginia to the western frontier across the [[Appalachian Mountains]].<ref name=bc273>''Biographical Cyclopedia'', p. 273</ref> When she approved, he organized an expedition with his brother-in-law, George Clark.<!-- Is this [[George Rogers Clark]], or another man? --><ref name=bc273 /><ref name=ellison949>Ellison, p. 949</ref>{{Ref|clack|[b]}} The pair met another party of seven pioneers; the two parties combined and continued with their expedition.<ref name=bc273 /> After scouting a location near a branch of the [[Dix River]] called Cedar Creek, they returned to Virginia to prepare for a permanent move west.<ref name=ellison949 /> \n\nThe families left Virginia in November 1775, shortly before the beginning of the [[American Revolutionary War]].<ref name=ellison949 /> When they reached their new site, Whitley planted {{convert|10|acre|m2}} of [[maize|corn]] to establish his claim to the land.<ref name=ellison949 /> He and his family moved to the safety of St. Asaph's fort (present-day [[Stanford, Kentucky]]), as the local [[Shawnee]] and [[Cherokee]] resisted European-American encroachment in their territory.<ref name=ellison949 /> In 1763, the British had promised the Native Americans that this area west of the mountains would be a reserve for them and prohibited to colonists.\n\nNot feeling safe, the Whitley and [[Benjamin Logan]] families moved to the protection of [[Fort Harrod]], near present-day [[Harrodsburg, Kentucky]]. In this period, Whitley saw the body of William Ray, who had been [[scalping|scalped]] by Indians. Many years later, when dictating his memoir to his son-in-law, Phillip Soublett, Whitley said that Ray's body was the first he had seen scalped. He was horrified and considered the Indians brutal for what he considered mutilation. During the Revolutionary War in 1779, Whitley discovered the mutilated bodies of the Starnese family near Blue Lick (south of [[Boonesborough, Kentucky]]) and documented the find.<ref name=hardin>''Hardin''</ref> There was continued warfare with [[Cherokee]] in the region during the revolution.\n\n==Military career==\nAfter the Revolutionary War, Whitley volunteered for service in [[George Rogers Clark]]'s expedition against Indians in the [[Northwest Territory]].<ref name=ellison949 /> He was assigned to [[Captain (United States)|Captain]] [[John Montgomery (pioneer)|John Montgomery]]'s [[Company (military unit)|Company]], which accompanied Clark's forces.<ref name=ellison949 /> During his military career, Whitley was known to scalp many natives as a militia leader and frontiersman. By 1779, Whitley had returned for his family and permanently settled on the land he had claimed years earlier in what is now Kentucky.<ref name=ellison949 />\n\nBy the 1790s, the settlement at St. Asaph's developed into the town of Stanford. Whitley and his family built a large brick house outside town, near what would later become [[Crab Orchard, Kentucky]].  The plantation was named Sportsman's Hill. It was the first brick house built in Kentucky and still stands, preserved as the [[William Whitley House State Historic Site]].  The house includes a [[secret passage]] for escape and survival during raids by [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]]. The plantation originally included a racetrack.  This racetrack set several traditions for [[horse racing]] in the United States. It had the first clay (instead of turf) track in the United States and here horses were raced counterclockwise (instead of clockwise, as was the British tradition).\n\nIn 1792, [[Isaac Shelby]], the newly elected [[governor of Kentucky]], commissioned Whitley as a [[Major (United States)|major]] in the 6th Regiment of the Kentucky militia.<ref name=ellison949 /> He was promoted to [[lieutenant colonel]] the following year.<ref name=ellison949 /> In 1794, he led 200 militiamen in a highly successful raid against a [[Chickamauga Wars (1776\u20131794)|Chickamauga]] village in [[Tennessee]].<ref name=ellison949 /> The Chickamauga were a band of [[Cherokee]], referred to by the geographic area where they lived.\n\nIn 1813, at the age of 64, Whitley returned to military service. He volunteered in the Kentucky Mounted Infantry during the [[War of 1812]] with Great Britain.<ref name=ellison949 /> In the [[Battle of the Thames]], on October 5, 1813, he led the \"Forlorn Hope\" charge against [[Tecumseh]]'s forces. Both Tecumseh and Whitley were killed in the battle. Whitley was buried near the battleground, in [[Chatham, Ontario]].<ref name=ellison949 /> Militia colleagues returned his horse, Emperor, his powder horn, strap, and rifle to his wife in Kentucky after the war. The rifle is currently on display at the William Whitley House State Historic Site. \n\nSome primary accounts suggest that Whitley was likely the person who killed Tecumseh. [[Richard Mentor Johnson]] is generally credited with killing the Shawnee leader. James A Drain, Sr. published an autobiography, ''Single Handed'' (1927), in which he recounts Whitley's granddaughter telling their family tradition that Whitley and Tecumseh killed each other simultaneously.<ref>Drain (1927), pp. 16-18</ref> \n\n==Political career==\nIn 1797, Whitley served a single term in the [[Kentucky House of Representatives]].<ref name=ellison949 /> He also represented [[Lincoln County, Kentucky|Lincoln County]] as a commissioner of the Kentucky River Company in 1801.<ref name=ellison949 /> \n\n==Legacy and honors==\n*In 1818, [[Whitley County, Kentucky]], and its county seat, [[Williamsburg, Kentucky|Williamsburg]], were named for the colonel.\n*A plaque on the Whitley County Courthouse credits Colonel Whitley with killing the last Indian (probably Cherokee) in the county. \n*In addition, the census-designated place [[Whitley City, Kentucky]], is named after the colonel.  \n*In 1838, [[Whitley County, Indiana]], was named after him. \n*One of his grandsons was [[William Sublette|William L.

Sublette was a member of the original fur-trapping expedition known as [[Ashley's Hundred]].\n*The 20th-century [[USS Whitley|Andromeda-class attack cargo ship ''USS Whitley'']] was named for the Whitley counties in Kentucky and Indiana.\n\n==Family==\n\nWilliam and Esther Whitley had eleven children, all of whom survived to maturity.\n\nThese were:\n# Elizabeth (Mrs. Robert Stevenson) b Augusta, Virginia, 1772, d Huntsville, Alabama, 1830.\n# Isabella (Mrs. Phillip Sublette), b Virginia, about 1774, d Kentucky about 1820.

During the Revolutionary War in 1779, Whitley discovered the mutilated bodies of the Starnese family near Blue Lick (south of [[Boonesborough, Kentucky]]) and documented the find.<ref name=hardin>''Hardin''</ref> There was continued warfare with [[Cherokee]] in the region during the revolution.\n\n==Military career==\nAfter the Revolutionary War, Whitley volunteered for service in [[George Rogers Clark]]'s expedition against Indians in the [[Northwest Territory]].<ref name=ellison949 /> He was assigned to [[Captain (United States)|Captain]] [[John Montgomery (pioneer)|John Montgomery]]'s [[Company (military unit)|Company]], which accompanied Clark's forces.<ref name=ellison949 /> During his military career, Whitley was known to scalp many natives as a militia leader and frontiersman. By 1779, Whitley had returned for his family and permanently settled on the land he had claimed years earlier in what is now Kentucky.<ref name=ellison949 />\n\nBy the 1790s, the settlement at St. Asaph's developed into the town of Stanford. Whitley and his family built a large brick house outside town, near what would later become [[Crab Orchard, Kentucky]].  The plantation was named Sportsman's Hill. It was the first brick house built in Kentucky and still stands, preserved as the [[William Whitley House State Historic Site]].  The house includes a [[secret passage]] for escape and survival during raids by [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]]. The plantation originally included a racetrack.  This racetrack set several traditions for [[horse racing]] in the United States. It had the first clay (instead of turf) track in the United States and here horses were raced counterclockwise (instead of clockwise, as was the British tradition).\n\nIn 1792, [[Isaac Shelby]], the newly elected [[governor of Kentucky]], commissioned Whitley as a [[Major (United States)|major]] in the 6th Regiment of the Kentucky militia.<ref name=ellison949 /> He was promoted to [[lieutenant colonel]] the following year.<ref name=ellison949 /> In 1794, he led 200 militiamen in a highly successful raid against a [[Chickamauga Wars (1776\u20131794)|Chickamauga]] village in [[Tennessee]].<ref name=ellison949 /> The Chickamauga were a band of [[Cherokee]], referred to by the geographic area where they lived.\n\nIn 1813, at the age of 64, Whitley returned to military service. He volunteered in the Kentucky Mounted Infantry during the [[War of 1812]] with Great Britain.<ref name=ellison949 /> In the [[Battle of the Thames]], on October 5, 1813, he led the \"Forlorn Hope\" charge against [[Tecumseh]]'s forces. Both Tecumseh and Whitley were killed in the battle. Whitley was buried near the battleground, in [[Chatham, Ontario]].<ref name=ellison949 /> Militia colleagues returned his horse, Emperor, his powder horn, strap, and rifle to his wife in Kentucky after the war. The rifle is currently on display at the William Whitley House State Historic Site. \n\nSome primary accounts suggest that Whitley was likely the person who killed Tecumseh. [[Richard Mentor Johnson]] is generally credited with killing the Shawnee leader. James A Drain, Sr. published an autobiography, ''Single Handed'' (1927), in which he recounts Whitley's granddaughter telling their family tradition that Whitley and Tecumseh killed each other simultaneously.<ref>Drain (1927), pp. 16-18</ref> \n\n==Political career==\nIn 1797, Whitley served a single term in the [[Kentucky House of Representatives]].<ref name=ellison949 /> He also represented [[Lincoln County, Kentucky|Lincoln County]] as a commissioner of the Kentucky River Company in 1801.<ref name=ellison949 /> \n\n==Legacy and honors==\n*In 1818, [[Whitley County, Kentucky]], and its county seat, [[Williamsburg, Kentucky|Williamsburg]], were named for the colonel.\n*A plaque on the Whitley County Courthouse credits Colonel Whitley with killing the last Indian (probably Cherokee) in the county. \n*In addition, the census-designated place [[Whitley City, Kentucky]], is named after the colonel.  \n*In 1838, [[Whitley County, Indiana]], was named after him. \n*One of his grandsons was [[William Sublette|William L. Sublette]], a fur trader who became co-owner of the [[Rocky Mountain Fur Company]] with [[Jedediah Smith]] and [[David Edward Jackson]]. Sublette was a member of the original fur-trapping expedition known as [[Ashley's Hundred]].\n*The 20th-century [[USS Whitley|Andromeda-class attack cargo ship ''USS Whitley'']] was named for the Whitley counties in Kentucky and Indiana.\n\n==Family==\n\nWilliam and Esther Whitley had eleven children, all of whom survived to maturity.\n\nThese were:\n# Elizabeth (Mrs. Robert Stevenson) b Augusta, Virginia, 1772, d Huntsville, Alabama, 1830.\n# Isabella (Mrs. Phillip Sublette), b Virginia, about 1774, d Kentucky about 1820. Phillip and Isabella's first-born son, William, was notable as a mountain man and [[fur trader]], known as [[Bill Sublette]]. Areas of Wyoming were named for him.\n# Levisa (Mrs. James McKinney), b Harrodsburg, KY, February 24, 1777. Moved to Missouri.\n# Solomon, b Kentucky 1770, moved to Missouri.\n# William, b Kentucky, Apr 20. 1782 - d Lincoln Co., KY, August 23, 1849.\n# Andrew, b Kentucky 1784 - d Lincoln Co. 1844.\n# Esther (Mrs. Samuel Lewis), b 1786 - d Woodford Co., KY 1815.\n# Mary (called Polly), (Mrs. James Gilmour), b Kentucky 1788, moved to Illinois; later to Colorado and Oregon.\n# Nancy (Mrs. John Owlsey), b 1790 - d prior to 1820 near Crab Orchard., KY\n# Sally (Mrs. Henley Middleton), b 1792 - d 1845 near Crab Orchard.\n# Ann (Mrs. William Harper), b 1795 - d Woodford Co., KY after 1870\n\nEsther Whitley died at the home of her daughter, Ann Harper, in Woodford County, Kentucky, November 20, 1833.<ref>Draper MS. 9 CC 5, 12-13, State Historical Society of Wisconsin.
