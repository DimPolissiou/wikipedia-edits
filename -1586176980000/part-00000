Their name comes from their ship, ''[[Argo]]'', named after its builder, [[Argus (son of Arestor)|Argus]]. \"Argonauts\" literally means \"''Argo'' sailors\". They were sometimes called [[Minyans]], after a [[prehistoric]] tribe in the area.\n\n== Mythology ==\n===The Golden Fleece===\n[[File:Pelias meets Jason MAN Napoli Inv111436.jpg|thumb|[[Pelias]], king of [[Iolcos]], stops on the steps of a temple as he recognises young Jason by his missing sandal; Roman [[fresco]] from [[Pompeii]], 1st century AD.|left]]\nAfter the death of King [[Cretheus]], the Aeolian [[Pelias]] usurped the throne from his half-brother [[Aeson]] and became king of [[Iolcus]] in [[Thessaly]] (near the modern city of [[Volos]]). Because of this unlawful act, an oracle warned him that a descendant of [[Aeolus]] would seek revenge. Pelias put to death every prominent descendant of Aeolus he could, but spared Aeson because of the pleas of their mother [[Tyro]]. Instead, Pelias kept Aeson prisoner and forced him to renounce his inheritance. Aeson married [[Alcimede]], who bore him a son named Jason. Pelias intended to kill the baby at once, but Alcimede summoned her kinswomen to weep over him as if he were stillborn. She faked a burial and smuggled the baby to [[Pelion|Mount Pelion]]. He was raised by the [[centaur]] [[Chiron]], the trainer of heroes.\n\nWhen Jason was 20 years old, an oracle ordered him to dress as a [[Magnetes|Magnesian]] and head to the Iolcan court. While traveling Jason lost his sandal crossing the muddy [[Anavros]] river while helping an old woman ([[Hera]] in disguise). The goddess was angry with King Pelias for killing his stepmother [[Sidero]] after she had sought refuge in Hera's temple.\n\nAnother oracle warned Pelias to be on his guard against a man with one shoe. Pelias was presiding over a sacrifice to [[Poseidon]] with several neighboring kings in attendance. Among the crowd stood a tall youth in leopard skin with only one sandal. Pelias recognized that Jason was his nephew. He could not kill him because prominent kings of the Aeolian family were present. Instead, he asked Jason: \"What would you do if an oracle announced that one of your fellow-citizens were destined to kill you?\" Jason replied that he would send him to go and fetch the [[Golden Fleece]], not knowing that Hera had put those words in his mouth.\n\nJason learned later that Pelias was being haunted by the ghost of [[Phrixus]]. Phrixus had fled from [[Orchomenus (Boeotia)|Orchomenus]] riding on a divine ram to avoid being sacrificed and took refuge in [[Colchis]] where he was later denied proper burial. According to an oracle, Iolcus would never prosper unless his ghost was taken back in a ship, together with the golden ram's fleece. This fleece now hung from a tree in the grove of the Colchian Ares, guarded night and day by a dragon that never slept. Pelias swore before [[Zeus]] that he would give up the throne at Jason's return while expecting that Jason's attempt to steal the Golden Fleece would be a fatal enterprise. However, Hera acted in Jason's favour during the perilous journey.\n\n===The crew of the ''Argo''===\nThere is no definite list of the Argonauts. H. J.

The reason of which was as follows: for several years, the women did not honor and make offerings to [[Aphrodite]] and because of her anger, she visited them with a noisome smell. Therefore, their spouses took captive women from the neighboring country of [[Thrace]] and bedded with them. Dishonored, all the Lemnian women, except [[Hypsipyle]], were instigated by the same goddess in conspiring to kill their fathers and husbands. They then deposed King [[Thoas (Tauri king)|Thoas]], who should have died along with the whole tribe of men, but was secretly spared by his daughter Hypsipyle. She put Thoas on board a ship which a storm carried to the island of [[History of Crimea|Taurica]].\n\nIn the meantime, the Argonauts sailing along, the guardian of the harbour [[Iphinoe (mythology)|Iphinoe]] saw them and announced their coming to Hypsipyle, the new queen. [[Polyxo]] who by virtue of her middle age, gave advice that she should put them under obligation to the gods of hospitality and invite them to a friendly reception. Hypsipyle fell in love with their captain Jason and bedded with him. She bore him sons, [[Euneus]] and [[Nebrophonus]] or [[Deipylus]]. The other Argonauts consorted with the Lemnian women, and their descendants were called [[Minyans]], since some among them had previously emigrated from [[Orchomenus (Boeotia)|Minyan Orchomenus]] to Iolcus. (Later, these Minyans were driven out from the island, and came to [[Lacedaemon]]). The Lemnian women gave the names of the Argonauts to the children they had conceived by them. Delayed many days there, they were chided by Hercules, and departed.<ref>[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Pseudo-Apollodorus]], ''Bibliotheca'' 1.9.17</ref><ref>[[Gaius Julius Hyginus|Hyginus]], ''Fabulae'' 15</ref>\n\nBut later, when the other women learned that Hypsipyle had spared her father, they tried to kill her. She fled from them, but pirates captured and took her to [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]], where they sold her as a slave to King [[Lycus (mythology)|Lycus]]. (Hypsipyle reappeared years later, when the [[Argives]] marching against [[Ancient Thebes (Boeotia)|Thebes]] learned from her the way to a spring in [[Nemea]], where she served as nurse to King [[Lycurgus of Nemea|Lycurgus]]' son [[Opheltes]].) Her son Euneus, later became king of Lemnos. In order to purify the island from blood guilt, he ordered that all Lemnian hearth-fires be put off for nine days and a new fire be brought on a ship from Apollo's altar in [[Delos]].\n\n=== Cyzicus' island ===\nAfter Lemnos, the Argonauts made their second stop at [[Kap\u0131da\u011f Peninsula|Bear Mountain]], an island of the [[Propontis]] shaped like a bear.<ref>\n{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gxwB5fQeMWIC|title=The Companion Guide to Istanbul and Around the Marmara|last1=Freely|first1=John|date=2000|publisher=Companion Guides|isbn=9781900639316|series=Companion guide to Turkey|volume=1|location=Woodbridge, Suffolk|page=350|quote=The Kapida\u011f peninsula was in antiquity known variously as Arctonoros (Bear Mountain) or Arctonissos (Bear Island). It was then indeed an island, which its early settlers linked to the mainland by bridges that could be removed when enemies appeared; in later times alluvial deposits created the isthmus that we see today.|author-link1=John Freely|access-date=2018-03-04}}\n</ref> The locals, called the [[Dolionians|Doliones]], were all descended from [[Poseidon]]. Their king [[Cyzicus (mythology)|Cyzicus]], son of [[Eusorus]], who had just got married received the Argonauts with generous hospitality and decided to have a huge party with them. During that event, the king tried to tell Jason not to go to the eastern side of the island, but he got distracted by Heracles, and forgot to tell Jason.\n\nWhen they had left the king and sailed a whole day, a storm that arose in the night brought them unaware to the same island. Cyzicus, thinking they were [[Pelasgian|Pelasgican]] army (for they were constantly harassed by these enemies) attacked them on the shore at night in mutual ignorance of each other. The Argonauts slew many and among the rest Cyzicus who was killed by Jason himself. On the next day, when they came near the shore and knew what they had done, the Argonauts mourned and cut off their hair. Meanwhile, Jason gave Cyzicus a costly burial and handed over the kingdom to his sons.<ref>Hyginus, ''Fabulae'' 16</ref><ref>Pseudo-Apollodorus, ''Bibliotheca'' 1.9.18</ref>\n\n=== Lost comrades ===\nAfter the burial, the Argonauts sailed away and touched at [[Mysia]] where they left Heracles and Polyphemus. For Hylas, son of Thiodamas, a minion of Heracles, had been sent to draw water and was ravished away by [[nymph]]s on account of his beauty. But Polyphemus heard him cry out, and drawing his sword gave chase in the belief that he was being carried off by robbers. Falling in with Heracles, he told him; and while the two were seeking for Hylas, the ship put to sea. So Polyphemus founded a city [[Cius]] in Mysia and reigned as king but Heracles returned to Argos. However, [[Herodorus]] says that Heracles did not sail at all at that time but served as a slave at the court of [[Omphale]]. But [[Pherecydes of Athens|Pherecydes]] says that he was left behind at [[Aphetae]] in Thessaly, the Argo having declared with human voice that she could not bear his weight. Nevertheless [[Demaratus of Corinth|Demaratus]] has recorded that Heracles sailed to Colchis; for [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus|Dionysius]] even affirms that he was the leader of the Argonauts.<ref>Pseudo-Apollodorus, ''Bibliotheca'' 1.9.19</ref>\n\n=== Land of the Bebrycians ===\nFrom Mysia, they departed to the land of the [[Bebryces]] which was ruled by King [[Amykos|Amycus]], son of Poseidon and [[Melia (mythology)|Melie]], a [[Bithynia]]n nymph. Being a doughty man, he compelled the strangers who came to his kingdom to contend with him in boxing and slew the vanquished. When he challenged the best man of the crew to a boxing match, Pollux fought against him and slew him with a blow on the elbow. When the Bebryces made a rush at him, the chiefs snatched up their arms and put them to flight with great slaughter.<ref>Pseudo-Apollodorus, ''Bibliotheca'' 1.19.20</ref><ref>Hyginus, ''Fabulae'' 17</ref>\n\n=== Phineus and the Harpies ===\nThence, they put to sea and came to land at Salmydessus in Thrace, where Phineus dwelt. The latter was said to be the son of [[Agenor (mythology)|Agenor]] or of [[Poseidon]], and a seer who was bestowed by Apollo with the gift of prophecy. Phineus had lost the sight of both eyes because of the following reasons, (1) blinded by Zeus because he revealed the deliberations of the gods and foretold the future to men, (2) by Boreas and the Argonauts because he blinded his own two sons by Cleopatra at the instigation of their stepmother; or by Poseidon, because he revealed to the children of Phrixus how they could sail from Colchis to Greece. Zeus then set over him the Harpies, who are called the hounds of Zeus. These were winged female creatures, and when a table was laid for Phineus, they flew down from the sky and snatched up most of the victuals from his lips, and what little they left stank so that nobody could touch it.\n\nWhen the Argonauts would have consulted him about the voyage, he said that he would advise them about it if they would free him from the punishment. So the Argonauts laid a table of viands beside him, and the Harpies with a shriek suddenly pounced down and snatched away the food. When Zetes and Calais, the sons of Boreas, saw that, they drew their swords and, having wings on head and feet, pursued them through the air. Now it was fated that the Harpies should perish by the sons of Boreas, and that the sons of Boreas should die when they could not catch up a fugitive. So the Harpies were pursued and one of them fell into the river Tigres in Peloponnese, the river that is now called Harpys after her; some call her Nicothoe, but others Aellopus. But the other, named Ocypete or, according to others, Ocythoe (but Hesiod calls her Ocypode) fled by the Propontis till she came to the [[Echinadian Islands]], which are now called Strophades after her; for when she came to them she turned (estraphe) and being at the shore fell for very weariness with her pursuer. But Apollonius in the Argonautica says that the Harpies were pursued to the Strophades Islands and suffered no harm, having sworn an oath that they would wrong Phineus no more. Eventually, the Argonauts freed Phineus from the punishment.<ref>Pseudo-Apollodorus, ''Bibliotheca'' 1.9.21</ref><ref>Hyginus, ''Fabulae'' 19</ref>\n\n=== The clashing rocks ===\nBeing rid of the Harpies, Phineus revealed to the Argonauts the course of their voyage, and advised them about the Clashing Rocks in the sea. These were huge cliffs, which, dashed together by the force of the winds, closed the sea passage. Thick was the mist that swept over them, and loud the crash, and it was impossible for even the birds to pass between them. So he told them to let fly a dove between the rocks, and, if they saw it pass safe through, to thread the narrows with an easy mind, but if they saw it perish, then not to force a passage. When they heard that, they put to sea, and on nearing the rocks let fly a dove from the prow, and as she flew the clash of the rocks nipped off the tip of her tail. So, waiting till the rocks had recoiled, with hard rowing and the help of Hera, they passed through, the extremity of the ship's ornamented poop being shorn away right round. Henceforth the Clashing Rocks stood still; for it was fated that, so soon as a ship had made the passage, they should come to rest completely.<ref>Pseudo-Apollodorus, ''Bibliotheca'' 1.9.22</ref>\n\n=== Lycus ===\nWhen the Argonauts had entered the sea called Euxine through the Cyanean Cliffs (i.e. Clashing Rocks of the Symplegades), the Argonauts now arrived among the Mariandynians. There King Lycus received them kindly grateful because they had killed Amycus, who had often attacked him. While the Argonauts were staying with Lycus, and had gone out to gather straw, the seer Idmon, son of Apollo, was wounded by a wild boar and died. Also, in that island Tiphys had died and Ancaeus undertook to steer the ship.<ref>Hyginus, ''Fabulae'' 18</ref>\n\n=== Island of Dia ===\nBy the will of Hera they were borne to the island of Dia. There birds were wounding them, using their feathers as arrows, they were not able to cope with the great numbers of birds. Following Phineus' advice they seized shields and spears, and dispersed them by the noise, after the manner of the Curetes.<ref>Hyginus, ''Fabulae'' 20</ref>\n\nThe Argonauts also found shipwrecked men in the island, naked and helpless\u2014the sons of Phrixus and Chalciope\u2014Argus, Phrontides, Melas, and Cylindrus. These told their misfortunes to Jason, how they had suffered shipwreck and been cast there when they were hastening to go to their grandfather Athamas, and Jason welcomed and aided them. And having sailed past the Thermodon and the Caucasus, they came to the river Phasis, which is in the Colchian land. The sons of Phrixus led Jason to land and bade the Argonauts to conceal the ship. They themselves went to their mother Chalciope, Medea's sister, and made known the kindness of Jason, and why they had come. Then Chalciope told about Medea, and brought her with her sons to Jason. When she saw him, she recognized him as the one whom in dreams she had loved deeply by Hera's urging, and promised him everything. They brought him to the temple.<ref>Hyginus, ''Fabulae'' 21</ref>\n\n=== Aeetes ===\nAn oracle told Aeetes, son of Helios, that he would keep his kingdom as long as the fleece which Phrixus had dedicated should remain at the shrine of Ares. When the ship was brought into port, Jason repaired to Aeetes, and setting forth the charge laid on him by Pelias invited him to give him the fleece. The other promised to give it if single-handed he would yoke with adamant the brazen-footed bulls. These were two wild bulls that he had, of enormous size, a gift of Hephaestus; they had brazen feet and puffed flames from their mouths and nostrils. These creatures Aeetes ordered him to yoke and plow, and to sow from a helmet the dragon's teeth; for he had got from Athena half of the dragon's teeth which Cadmus sowed in Thebes. These tribe of armed men should arise and slay each other. While Jason puzzled how he could yoke the bulls, Hera wished to save him because once when she had come to a river and wished to test the minds of men, she assumed an old woman's form, and asked to be carried across. He had carried her across when others who had passed over despised her. And so since she knew that Jason could not perform the commands without help of Medea, she asked Aphrodite to inspire Medea, daughter of Aeetes and the Oceanid Idyia, with love.\n\nAt Aphrodite's instigation, the witch conceived a passion for the man. Fearing lest that Jason might be destroyed by the bulls, she, keeping the thing from her father, promised to help him to yoke the bulls and to deliver to him the fleece. Medea also asked the hero to swear to have her to become his wife and would take her with him on the voyage to Greece. When Jason swore to do so, she aid him to be freed from all danger, for she gave him a drug with which she bade him anoint his shield, spear, and body when he was about to yoke the bulls; for she said that, anointed with it, he could for a single day be harmed neither by fire nor by iron. And she signified to him that, when the teeth were sown, armed men would spring up from the ground against him; and when he saw a knot of them he was to throw stones into their midst from a distance, and when they fought each other about that, he was taken to kill them. On hearing that, Jason anointed himself with the drug, and being come to the grove of the temple he sought the bulls, and though they charged him with a flame of fire, he yoked them. And when he had sowed the teeth, there rose armed men from the ground; and where he saw several together, he pelted them unseen with stones, and when they fought each other he drew near and slew them. But though the bulls were yoked, Aeetes did not give the fleece; for he wished to burn down the Argo and kill the crew. But before he could do so, Medea brought Jason by night to the shrine, and having lulled to sleep by her drugs the dragon that guarded it, she possessed herself of the fleece. In Jason's company, she came to the Argo and the Argonauts put to sea by night to set off to their country.<ref>Hyginus, ''Fabulae'' 22</ref>\n\n=== Absyrtus ===\nMedea was attended by her brother Apsyrtus when they escaped from Colchis. When discovered the daring deeds done by Medea, he started off in pursuit of the ship but when she saw him near, Medea murdered her brother and cutting him limb from limb threw the pieces into the deep. Gathering the child's limbs, Aeetes fell behind in the pursuit; wherefore he turned back, and, having buried the rescued limbs of his child, he called the place Tomi. But he sent out many of the Colchians to search for the Argo, threatening that, if they did not bring Medea to him, they should suffer the punishment due to her; so they separated and pursued the search in diverse places. When the Argonauts were already sailing past the Eridanus river, Zeus sent a furious storm upon them, and drove them out of their course, because he was angry at the murder of Apsyrtus. And as they were sailing past the Apsyrtides Islands, the ship spoke, saying that the wrath of Zeus would not cease unless they journeyed to Ausonia and were purified by Circe for the murder of Apsyrtus. So when they had sailed past the Ligurian and Celtic nations and had voyaged through the Sardinian Sea, they skirted Tyrrhenia and came to Aeaea, where they supplicated Circe and were purified.\n\n=== Sirens ===\nAnd as they sailed past the Sirens, Orpheus restrained the Argonauts by chanting a counter-melody. Butes alone swam off to the Sirens, but Aphrodite carried him away and settled him in Lilybaion. After the Sirens, the ship encountered Charybdis and Scylla and the Wandering Rocks, above which a great flame and smoke were seen rising. But Thetis with the Nereids steered the ship through them at the summons of Hera.\n\n=== Phaeacians ===\nHaving passed by the Island of Thrinacia, where are the kine of the Sun, they came to Corcyra, the island of the Phaeacians, of which Alcinous was king. But when the Colchians could not find the ship, some of them settled at the Ceraunian mountains, and some journeyed to Illyria and colonized the Apsyrtides Islands. But some came to the Phaeacians, and finding the Argo there, they demanded of Alcinous that he should give up Medea. He answered, that if she already knew Jason, he would give her to him, but that if she were still a maid he would send her away to her father. However, Arete, wife of Alcinous, anticipated matters by marrying Medea to Jason.\n\nIn some accounts, however, Absyrtus with armed guards was sent in pursuit of the Argo by his father Aeetes. When the latter had caught up with her in the Adriatic Sea in Histria at King Alcinous' court, and would fight for her, Alcinous intervened to prevent their fighting. They took him as arbiter, and he put them off till the next day. When he seemed depressed and Arete, his wife, asked him the cause of his sadness, he said he had been made arbiter by two different states, to judge between Colchians and Argives. When Arete asked him what judgment he would give, Alcinous replied that if Medea were a virgin, he would give her to her father, but if not, to her husband. When Arete heard this from her husband, she sent word to Jason, and he lay with Medea by night in a cave. Then next day when they came to court, and Medea was found to be a wife she was given to her husband. Nevertheless, when they had left, Absyrtus, fearing his father's commands, pursued them to the island of Athena. When Jason was sacrificing there to Athena, and Absyrtus came upon him, he was killed by Jason. Medea gave him burial, and they departed. The Colchians who had come with Absyrtus, fearing Aeetes, settled down among the Phaeacians and founded a town which from Absyrtus' name they called Absoros. Now this island is located in Histria, opposite Pola.<ref>Hyginus, ''Fabulae'' 23</ref>\n\nSailing by night, the Argonauts encountered a violent storm, and Apollo, taking his stand on the Melantian ridges, flashed lightning down, shooting a shaft into the sea. Then they perceived an island close at hand, and anchoring there they named it Anaphe, because it had loomed up (anaphanenai) unexpectedly. So they founded an altar of Radiant Apollo, and having offered sacrifice they betook them to feasting; and twelve handmaids, whom Arete had given to Medea, jested merrily with the chiefs; whence it is still customary for the women to jest at the sacrifice.\n\n=== Talos ===\nPutting to sea from there, they were hindered from touching at Crete by Talos. Some say that he was a man of the Brazen Race, others that he was given to Minos by Hephaestus; he was a brazen man, but some say that he was a bull. He had a single vein extending from his neck to his ankles, and a bronze nail was rammed home at the end of the vein. This Talos kept guard, running round the island thrice every day; wherefore, when he saw the Argo standing inshore, he pelted it as usual with stones. His death was brought about by the wiles of Medea, whether, as some say, she drove him mad by drugs, or, as others say, she promised to make him immortal and then drew out the nail, so that all the ichor gushed out and he died. But some say that Poeas shot him dead in the ankle.\n\n=== Homecoming ===\nAfter tarrying a single night there they put in to Aigina to draw water, and a contest arose among them concerning the drawing of the water. Thence they sailed betwixt Euboea and Locris and came to Iolcus, having completed the whole voyage in four months.\n\n=== Alternative stories for the returned route ===\n[[Sozomen]] wrote that when the Argonauts left from the Aeetes, they returned from a different route, crossed the sea of [[Scythia]], sailed through some of the rivers there, and when they were near the shores of [[Italy]], they built a city in order to stay at the winter, which they called [[Emona]] ({{lang-grc|\u1f2c\u03bc\u03bf\u03bd\u03b1}}), part of modern-day [[Ljubljana]] at [[Slovenia]]. At summer, with the assistance of the locals, they dragged the Argo to the Aquilis river ({{lang-grc|\u1f0c\u03ba\u03c5\u03bb\u03b9\u03bd \u03c0\u03bf\u03c4\u03b1\u03bc\u1f78\u03bd}}), which falls into the Eridanus. The Eridanus itself falls into the [[Adriatic sea]].<ref>[http://cts.perseids.org/read/greekLit/tlg2048/tlg001/1st1K-grc1/1.6 Sozomenos, Ecclesiastical History, \u00a71.6]</ref>\n\n[[Zosimus]] wrote that after they left from the Aeetes, they arrived at the mouth of the [[Danube|Ister river]] which it discharges itself into the [[Black Sea]] and they went up that river against the stream, by the help of oars and convenient gales of wind. After they managed to do it, they built the city of Emona as a memorial of their arrival there. Afterwards placing the Argo, on machines they drew it as far as the sea-side and from there they went at the Thessalian shore.<ref>[https://topostext.org/work/740#5.29 Zosimus, New History, 5.29]</ref>\n\n[[Pliny the Elder]] wrote that some writers claim that the Argo came down some river into the Adriatic sea, not far from [[Tergeste]] but that river is now unknown. While other writers say that the ship was carried across the Alps on men's shoulders, having passed along the Ister river, then along the [[Savus]] river, and then to [[Nauportus]] which is lying between the Emona and the Alps.<ref>[https://topostext.org/work/148#3.22.1 Pliny the Elder, Natural History, \u00a73.22.1]</ref>\n\n==Adaptations of the myth==\n===Literature===\n* The ''[[Argonautica]]'' by [[Apollonius of Rhodes]], a 3rd-century BC Greek epic poem.\n* The ''Argonautica'' by [[Gaius Valerius Flaccus]], a 1st-century AD Latin epic poem.\n* ''The Life and Death of Jason'' (1867) by [[William Morris]]\n* ''Hercules, My Shipmate'' (1945) by [[Robert Graves]]\n* ''[[The Greek Myths]]'' (1955) by Robert Graves\n* ''Jason and Medeia'' (1975) by [[John Gardner (novelist)|John Gardner]], a modern, epic poem in English.\n* ''Despoiled Shore Medea Material Landscape with Argonauts'' (1982) - a play in the synthetic fragment form by [[Heiner M\u00fcller]]\n* ''The Argonauts'' (2015) by Maggie Nelson\n\n===Film and television===\n* The TV series ''[[Sea Hunt]]'' (1958\u201361) featured a yacht named the ''Argonaut.'' \n*''[[Jason and the Argonauts (1963 film)|Jason and the Argonauts]]'' (1963) - film directed by [[Don Chaffey]]\n* ''The Argonauts'' (1971) - Soviet cartoon\n* ''Das Goldene Ding'' (\"The Golden Thing\", 1972) German movie directed by [[Edgar Reitz]]\n* ''[[Underworld (Doctor Who)|Underworld]]'' (1977) - ''[[Doctor Who]]'' serial loosely based on the story of Jason and the Argonauts\n* ''The Merry Chronicle of the Dangerous Journey'' (''[[:ru:\u0412\u0435\u0441\u0451\u043b\u0430\u044f \u0445\u0440\u043e\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u043e\u043f\u0430\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043f\u0443\u0442\u0435\u0448\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0438\u044f|\u0412\u0435\u0441\u0451\u043b\u0430\u044f \u0445\u0440\u043e\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u043e\u043f\u0430\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043f\u0443\u0442\u0435\u0448\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0438\u044f]]'') - a 1986 Soviet musical.\n* ''[[Class of the Titans]]'' (2005-2008) - A Canadian animated TV series featuring a modern interpretation of the legend.\n* ''[[Atlantis (TV series)|Atlantis]]'' (2013) - television show developed by the BBC\n\n==See also==\n* [[Argo Navis]]\n* [[Argonaut Mine]]\n* [[Jason]] for more details on the quest for the Golden Fleece\n* [[Toronto Argonauts]], a Canadian Football League team\n* [[Argonaut Rowing Club]], a rowing club based out of Toronto\n* [[University of West Florida]]; the mascot of the University\n* [[Maggie Nelson]], The Argonauts\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n* [[Apollonius Rhodius]], ''[[Argonautica]]'' I, 23\u2013227\n* Pseudo-Apollodorus, ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]'' I, ix, 16.\n* [[Ken Inglis]], ''This is the ABC: The Australian Broadcasting Commission 1932\u20131983'', 2006\n\n==Further reading==\n* J.R.

Their name comes from their ship, ''[[Argo]]'', named after its builder, [[Argus (son of Arestor)|Argus]]. \"Argonauts\" literally means \"''Argo'' sailors\". They were sometimes called [[Minyans]], after a [[prehistoric]] tribe in the area.\n\n== Mythology ==\n===The Golden Fleece===\n[[File:Pelias meets Jason MAN Napoli Inv111436.jpg|thumb|[[Pelias]], king of [[Iolcos]], stops on the steps of a temple as he recognises young Jason by his missing sandal; Roman [[fresco]] from [[Pompeii]], 1st century AD.|left]]\nAfter the death of King [[Cretheus]], the Aeolian [[Pelias]] usurped the throne from his half-brother [[Aeson]] and became king of [[Iolcus]] in [[Thessaly]] (near the modern city of [[Volos]]). Because of this unlawful act, an oracle warned him that a descendant of [[Aeolus]] would seek revenge. Pelias put to death every prominent descendant of Aeolus he could, but spared Aeson because of the pleas of their mother [[Tyro]]. Instead, Pelias kept Aeson prisoner and forced him to renounce his inheritance. Aeson married [[Alcimede]], who bore him a son named Jason. Pelias intended to kill the baby at once, but Alcimede summoned her kinswomen to weep over him as if he were stillborn. She faked a burial and smuggled the baby to [[Pelion|Mount Pelion]]. He was raised by the [[centaur]] [[Chiron]], the trainer of heroes.\n\nWhen Jason was 20 years old, an oracle ordered him to dress as a [[Magnetes|Magnesian]] and head to the Iolcan court. While traveling Jason lost his sandal crossing the muddy [[Anavros]] river while helping an old woman ([[Hera]] in disguise). The goddess was angry with King Pelias for killing his stepmother [[Sidero]] after she had sought refuge in Hera's temple.\n\nAnother oracle warned Pelias to be on his guard against a man with one shoe. Pelias was presiding over a sacrifice to [[Poseidon]] with several neighboring kings in attendance. Among the crowd stood a tall youth in leopard skin with only one sandal. Pelias recognized that Jason was his nephew. He could not kill him because prominent kings of the Aeolian family were present. Instead, he asked Jason: \"What would you do if an oracle announced that one of your fellow-citizens were destined to kill you?\" Jason replied that he would send him to go and fetch the [[Golden Fleece]], not knowing that Hera had put those words in his mouth.\n\nJason learned later that Pelias was being haunted by the ghost of [[Phrixus]]. Phrixus had fled from [[Orchomenus (Boeotia)|Orchomenus]] riding on a divine ram to avoid being sacrificed and took refuge in [[Colchis]] where he was later denied proper burial. According to an oracle, Iolcus would never prosper unless his ghost was taken back in a ship, together with the golden ram's fleece. This fleece now hung from a tree in the grove of the Colchian Ares, guarded night and day by a dragon that never slept. Pelias swore before [[Zeus]] that he would give up the throne at Jason's return while expecting that Jason's attempt to steal the Golden Fleece would be a fatal enterprise.

The reason of which was as follows: for several years, the women did not honor and make offerings to [[Aphrodite]] and because of her anger, she visited them with a noisome smell. Therefore, their spouses took captive women from the neighboring country of [[Thrace]] and bedded with them. Dishonored, all the Lemnian women, except [[Hypsipyle]], were instigated by the same goddess in conspiring to kill their fathers and husbands. They then deposed King [[Thoas (Tauri king)|Thoas]], who should have died along with the whole tribe of men, but was secretly spared by his daughter Hypsipyle. She put Thoas on board a ship which a storm carried to the island of [[History of Crimea|Taurica]].\n\nIn the meantime, the Argonauts sailing along, the guardian of the harbour [[Iphinoe (mythology)|Iphinoe]] saw them and announced their coming to Hypsipyle, the new queen. [[Polyxo]] who by virtue of her middle age, gave advice that she should put them under obligation to the gods of hospitality and invite them to a friendly reception. Hypsipyle fell in love with their captain Jason and bedded with him. She bore him sons, [[Euneus]] and [[Nebrophonus]] or [[Deipylus]]. The other Argonauts consorted with the Lemnian women, and their descendants were called [[Minyans]], since some among them had previously emigrated from [[Orchomenus (Boeotia)|Minyan Orchomenus]] to Iolcus. (Later, these Minyans were driven out from the island, and came to [[Lacedaemon]]). The Lemnian women gave the names of the Argonauts to the children they had conceived by them. Delayed many days there, they were chided by Hercules, and departed.<ref>[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Pseudo-Apollodorus]], ''Bibliotheca'' 1.9.17</ref><ref>[[Gaius Julius Hyginus|Hyginus]], ''Fabulae'' 15</ref>\n\nBut later, when the other women learned that Hypsipyle had spared her father, they tried to kill her. She fled from them, but pirates captured and took her to [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]], where they sold her as a slave to King [[Lycus (mythology)|Lycus]]. (Hypsipyle reappeared years later, when the [[Argives]] marching against [[Ancient Thebes (Boeotia)|Thebes]] learned from her the way to a spring in [[Nemea]], where she served as nurse to King [[Lycurgus of Nemea|Lycurgus]]' son [[Opheltes]].) Her son Euneus, later became king of Lemnos. In order to purify the island from blood guilt, he ordered that all Lemnian hearth-fires be put off for nine days and a new fire be brought on a ship from Apollo's altar in [[Delos]].\n\n=== Cyzicus' island ===\nAfter Lemnos, the Argonauts made their second stop at [[Kap\u0131da\u011f Peninsula|Bear Mountain]], an island of the [[Propontis]] shaped like a bear.<ref>\n{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gxwB5fQeMWIC|title=The Companion Guide to Istanbul and Around the Marmara|last1=Freely|first1=John|date=2000|publisher=Companion Guides|isbn=9781900639316|series=Companion guide to Turkey|volume=1|location=Woodbridge, Suffolk|page=350|quote=The Kapida\u011f peninsula was in antiquity known variously as Arctonoros (Bear Mountain) or Arctonissos (Bear Island). It was then indeed an island, which its early settlers linked to the mainland by bridges that could be removed when enemies appeared; in later times alluvial deposits created the isthmus that we see today.|author-link1=John Freely|access-date=2018-03-04}}\n</ref> The locals, called the [[Dolionians|Doliones]], were all descended from [[Poseidon]]. Their king [[Cyzicus (mythology)|Cyzicus]], son of [[Eusorus]], who had just got married received the Argonauts with generous hospitality and decided to have a huge party with them. During that event, the king tried to tell Jason not to go to the eastern side of the island, but he got distracted by Heracles, and forgot to tell Jason.\n\nWhen they had left the king and sailed a whole day, a storm that arose in the night brought them unaware to the same island. Cyzicus, thinking they were [[Pelasgian|Pelasgican]] army (for they were constantly harassed by these enemies) attacked them on the shore at night in mutual ignorance of each other. The Argonauts slew many and among the rest Cyzicus who was killed by Jason himself. On the next day, when they came near the shore and knew what they had done, the Argonauts mourned and cut off their hair. Meanwhile, Jason gave Cyzicus a costly burial and handed over the kingdom to his sons.<ref>Hyginus, ''Fabulae'' 16</ref><ref>Pseudo-Apollodorus, ''Bibliotheca'' 1.9.18</ref>\n\n=== Lost comrades ===\nAfter the burial, the Argonauts sailed away and touched at [[Mysia]] where they left Heracles and Polyphemus. For Hylas, son of Thiodamas, a minion of Heracles, had been sent to draw water and was ravished away by [[nymph]]s on account of his beauty. But Polyphemus heard him cry out, and drawing his sword gave chase in the belief that he was being carried off by robbers. Falling in with Heracles, he told him; and while the two were seeking for Hylas, the ship put to sea. So Polyphemus founded a city [[Cius]] in Mysia and reigned as king but Heracles returned to Argos. However, [[Herodorus]] says that Heracles did not sail at all at that time but served as a slave at the court of [[Omphale]]. But [[Pherecydes of Athens|Pherecydes]] says that he was left behind at [[Aphetae]] in Thessaly, the Argo having declared with human voice that she could not bear his weight. Nevertheless [[Demaratus of Corinth|Demaratus]] has recorded that Heracles sailed to Colchis; for [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus|Dionysius]] even affirms that he was the leader of the Argonauts.<ref>Pseudo-Apollodorus, ''Bibliotheca'' 1.9.19</ref>\n\n=== Land of the Bebrycians ===\nFrom Mysia, they departed to the land of the [[Bebryces]] which was ruled by King [[Amykos|Amycus]], son of Poseidon and [[Melia (mythology)|Melie]], a [[Bithynia]]n nymph. Being a doughty man, he compelled the strangers who came to his kingdom to contend with him in boxing and slew the vanquished. When he challenged the best man of the crew to a boxing match, Pollux fought against him and slew him with a blow on the elbow. When the Bebryces made a rush at him, the chiefs snatched up their arms and put them to flight with great slaughter.<ref>Pseudo-Apollodorus, ''Bibliotheca'' 1.19.20</ref><ref>Hyginus, ''Fabulae'' 17</ref>\n\n=== Phineus and the Harpies ===\nThence, they put to sea and came to land at Salmydessus in Thrace, where Phineus dwelt. The latter was said to be the son of [[Agenor (mythology)|Agenor]] or of [[Poseidon]], and a seer who was bestowed by Apollo with the gift of prophecy. Phineus had lost the sight of both eyes because of the following reasons, (1) blinded by Zeus because he revealed the deliberations of the gods and foretold the future to men, (2) by Boreas and the Argonauts because he blinded his own two sons by Cleopatra at the instigation of their stepmother; or by Poseidon, because he revealed to the children of Phrixus how they could sail from Colchis to Greece. Zeus then set over him the Harpies, who are called the hounds of Zeus. These were winged female creatures, and when a table was laid for Phineus, they flew down from the sky and snatched up most of the victuals from his lips, and what little they left stank so that nobody could touch it.\n\nWhen the Argonauts would have consulted him about the voyage, he said that he would advise them about it if they would free him from the punishment. So the Argonauts laid a table of viands beside him, and the Harpies with a shriek suddenly pounced down and snatched away the food. When Zetes and Calais, the sons of Boreas, saw that, they drew their swords and, having wings on head and feet, pursued them through the air. Now it was fated that the Harpies should perish by the sons of Boreas, and that the sons of Boreas should die when they could not catch up a fugitive. So the Harpies were pursued and one of them fell into the river Tigres in Peloponnese, the river that is now called Harpys after her; some call her Nicothoe, but others Aellopus. But the other, named Ocypete or, according to others, Ocythoe (but Hesiod calls her Ocypode) fled by the Propontis till she came to the Echinadian Islands, which are now called Strophades after her; for when she came to them she turned (estraphe) and being at the shore fell for very weariness with her pursuer. But Apollonius in the Argonautica says that the Harpies were pursued to the Strophades Islands and suffered no harm, having sworn an oath that they would wrong Phineus no more. Eventually, the Argonauts freed Phineus from the punishment.<ref>Pseudo-Apollodorus, ''Bibliotheca'' 1.9.21</ref><ref>Hyginus, ''Fabulae'' 19</ref>\n\n=== The clashing rocks ===\nBeing rid of the Harpies, Phineus revealed to the Argonauts the course of their voyage, and advised them about the Clashing Rocks in the sea. These were huge cliffs, which, dashed together by the force of the winds, closed the sea passage. Thick was the mist that swept over them, and loud the crash, and it was impossible for even the birds to pass between them. So he told them to let fly a dove between the rocks, and, if they saw it pass safe through, to thread the narrows with an easy mind, but if they saw it perish, then not to force a passage. When they heard that, they put to sea, and on nearing the rocks let fly a dove from the prow, and as she flew the clash of the rocks nipped off the tip of her tail. So, waiting till the rocks had recoiled, with hard rowing and the help of Hera, they passed through, the extremity of the ship's ornamented poop being shorn away right round. Henceforth the Clashing Rocks stood still; for it was fated that, so soon as a ship had made the passage, they should come to rest completely.<ref>Pseudo-Apollodorus, ''Bibliotheca'' 1.9.22</ref>\n\n=== Lycus ===\nWhen the Argonauts had entered the sea called Euxine through the Cyanean Cliffs (i.e. Clashing Rocks of the Symplegades), the Argonauts now arrived among the Mariandynians. There King Lycus received them kindly grateful because they had killed Amycus, who had often attacked him. While the Argonauts were staying with Lycus, and had gone out to gather straw, the seer Idmon, son of Apollo, was wounded by a wild boar and died. Also, in that island Tiphys had died and Ancaeus undertook to steer the ship.<ref>Hyginus, ''Fabulae'' 18</ref>\n\n=== Island of Dia ===\nBy the will of Hera they were borne to the island of Dia. There birds were wounding them, using their feathers as arrows, they were not able to cope with the great numbers of birds. Following Phineus' advice they seized shields and spears, and dispersed them by the noise, after the manner of the Curetes.<ref>Hyginus, ''Fabulae'' 20</ref>\n\nThe Argonauts also found shipwrecked men in the island, naked and helpless\u2014the sons of Phrixus and Chalciope\u2014Argus, Phrontides, Melas, and Cylindrus. These told their misfortunes to Jason, how they had suffered shipwreck and been cast there when they were hastening to go to their grandfather Athamas, and Jason welcomed and aided them. And having sailed past the Thermodon and the Caucasus, they came to the river Phasis, which is in the Colchian land. The sons of Phrixus led Jason to land and bade the Argonauts to conceal the ship. They themselves went to their mother Chalciope, Medea's sister, and made known the kindness of Jason, and why they had come. Then Chalciope told about Medea, and brought her with her sons to Jason. When she saw him, she recognized him as the one whom in dreams she had loved deeply by Hera's urging, and promised him everything. They brought him to the temple.<ref>Hyginus, ''Fabulae'' 21</ref>\n\n=== Aeetes ===\nAn oracle told Aeetes, son of Helios, that he would keep his kingdom as long as the fleece which Phrixus had dedicated should remain at the shrine of Ares. When the ship was brought into port, Jason repaired to Aeetes, and setting forth the charge laid on him by Pelias invited him to give him the fleece. The other promised to give it if single-handed he would yoke with adamant the brazen-footed bulls. These were two wild bulls that he had, of enormous size, a gift of Hephaestus; they had brazen feet and puffed flames from their mouths and nostrils. These creatures Aeetes ordered him to yoke and plow, and to sow from a helmet the dragon's teeth; for he had got from Athena half of the dragon's teeth which Cadmus sowed in Thebes. These tribe of armed men should arise and slay each other. While Jason puzzled how he could yoke the bulls, Hera wished to save him because once when she had come to a river and wished to test the minds of men, she assumed an old woman's form, and asked to be carried across. He had carried her across when others who had passed over despised her. And so since she knew that Jason could not perform the commands without help of Medea, she asked Aphrodite to inspire Medea, daughter of Aeetes and the Oceanid Idyia, with love.\n\nAt Aphrodite's instigation, the witch conceived a passion for the man. Fearing lest that Jason might be destroyed by the bulls, she, keeping the thing from her father, promised to help him to yoke the bulls and to deliver to him the fleece. Medea also asked the hero to swear to have her to become his wife and would take her with him on the voyage to Greece. When Jason swore to do so, she aid him to be freed from all danger, for she gave him a drug with which she bade him anoint his shield, spear, and body when he was about to yoke the bulls; for she said that, anointed with it, he could for a single day be harmed neither by fire nor by iron. And she signified to him that, when the teeth were sown, armed men would spring up from the ground against him; and when he saw a knot of them he was to throw stones into their midst from a distance, and when they fought each other about that, he was taken to kill them. On hearing that, Jason anointed himself with the drug, and being come to the grove of the temple he sought the bulls, and though they charged him with a flame of fire, he yoked them. And when he had sowed the teeth, there rose armed men from the ground; and where he saw several together, he pelted them unseen with stones, and when they fought each other he drew near and slew them. But though the bulls were yoked, Aeetes did not give the fleece; for he wished to burn down the Argo and kill the crew. But before he could do so, Medea brought Jason by night to the shrine, and having lulled to sleep by her drugs the dragon that guarded it, she possessed herself of the fleece. In Jason's company, she came to the Argo and the Argonauts put to sea by night to set off to their country.<ref>Hyginus, ''Fabulae'' 22</ref>\n\n=== Absyrtus ===\nMedea was attended by her brother Apsyrtus when they escaped from Colchis. When discovered the daring deeds done by Medea, he started off in pursuit of the ship but when she saw him near, Medea murdered her brother and cutting him limb from limb threw the pieces into the deep. Gathering the child's limbs, Aeetes fell behind in the pursuit; wherefore he turned back, and, having buried the rescued limbs of his child, he called the place Tomi. But he sent out many of the Colchians to search for the Argo, threatening that, if they did not bring Medea to him, they should suffer the punishment due to her; so they separated and pursued the search in diverse places. When the Argonauts were already sailing past the Eridanus river, Zeus sent a furious storm upon them, and drove them out of their course, because he was angry at the murder of Apsyrtus. And as they were sailing past the Apsyrtides Islands, the ship spoke, saying that the wrath of Zeus would not cease unless they journeyed to Ausonia and were purified by Circe for the murder of Apsyrtus. So when they had sailed past the Ligurian and Celtic nations and had voyaged through the Sardinian Sea, they skirted Tyrrhenia and came to Aeaea, where they supplicated Circe and were purified.\n\n=== Sirens ===\nAnd as they sailed past the Sirens, Orpheus restrained the Argonauts by chanting a counter-melody. Butes alone swam off to the Sirens, but Aphrodite carried him away and settled him in Lilybaion. After the Sirens, the ship encountered Charybdis and Scylla and the Wandering Rocks, above which a great flame and smoke were seen rising. But Thetis with the Nereids steered the ship through them at the summons of Hera.\n\n=== Phaeacians ===\nHaving passed by the Island of Thrinacia, where are the kine of the Sun, they came to Corcyra, the island of the Phaeacians, of which Alcinous was king. But when the Colchians could not find the ship, some of them settled at the Ceraunian mountains, and some journeyed to Illyria and colonized the Apsyrtides Islands. But some came to the Phaeacians, and finding the Argo there, they demanded of Alcinous that he should give up Medea. He answered, that if she already knew Jason, he would give her to him, but that if she were still a maid he would send her away to her father. However, Arete, wife of Alcinous, anticipated matters by marrying Medea to Jason.\n\nIn some accounts, however, Absyrtus with armed guards was sent in pursuit of the Argo by his father Aeetes. When the latter had caught up with her in the Adriatic Sea in Histria at King Alcinous' court, and would fight for her, Alcinous intervened to prevent their fighting. They took him as arbiter, and he put them off till the next day. When he seemed depressed and Arete, his wife, asked him the cause of his sadness, he said he had been made arbiter by two different states, to judge between Colchians and Argives. When Arete asked him what judgment he would give, Alcinous replied that if Medea were a virgin, he would give her to her father, but if not, to her husband. When Arete heard this from her husband, she sent word to Jason, and he lay with Medea by night in a cave. Then next day when they came to court, and Medea was found to be a wife she was given to her husband. Nevertheless, when they had left, Absyrtus, fearing his father's commands, pursued them to the island of Athena. When Jason was sacrificing there to Athena, and Absyrtus came upon him, he was killed by Jason. Medea gave him burial, and they departed. The Colchians who had come with Absyrtus, fearing Aeetes, settled down among the Phaeacians and founded a town which from Absyrtus' name they called Absoros. Now this island is located in Histria, opposite Pola.<ref>Hyginus, ''Fabulae'' 23</ref>\n\nSailing by night, the Argonauts encountered a violent storm, and Apollo, taking his stand on the Melantian ridges, flashed lightning down, shooting a shaft into the sea. Then they perceived an island close at hand, and anchoring there they named it Anaphe, because it had loomed up (anaphanenai) unexpectedly. So they founded an altar of Radiant Apollo, and having offered sacrifice they betook them to feasting; and twelve handmaids, whom Arete had given to Medea, jested merrily with the chiefs; whence it is still customary for the women to jest at the sacrifice.\n\n=== Talos ===\nPutting to sea from there, they were hindered from touching at Crete by Talos. Some say that he was a man of the Brazen Race, others that he was given to Minos by Hephaestus; he was a brazen man, but some say that he was a bull. He had a single vein extending from his neck to his ankles, and a bronze nail was rammed home at the end of the vein. This Talos kept guard, running round the island thrice every day; wherefore, when he saw the Argo standing inshore, he pelted it as usual with stones. His death was brought about by the wiles of Medea, whether, as some say, she drove him mad by drugs, or, as others say, she promised to make him immortal and then drew out the nail, so that all the ichor gushed out and he died. But some say that Poeas shot him dead in the ankle.\n\n=== Homecoming ===\nAfter tarrying a single night there they put in to Aigina to draw water, and a contest arose among them concerning the drawing of the water. Thence they sailed betwixt Euboea and Locris and came to Iolcus, having completed the whole voyage in four months.\n\n=== Alternative stories for the returned route ===\n[[Sozomen]] wrote that when the Argonauts left from the Aeetes, they returned from a different route, crossed the sea of [[Scythia]], sailed through some of the rivers there, and when they were near the shores of [[Italy]], they built a city in order to stay at the winter, which they called [[Emona]] ({{lang-grc|\u1f2c\u03bc\u03bf\u03bd\u03b1}}), part of modern-day [[Ljubljana]] at [[Slovenia]]. At summer, with the assistance of the locals, they dragged the Argo to the Aquilis river ({{lang-grc|\u1f0c\u03ba\u03c5\u03bb\u03b9\u03bd \u03c0\u03bf\u03c4\u03b1\u03bc\u1f78\u03bd}}), which falls into the Eridanus. The Eridanus itself falls into the [[Adriatic sea]].<ref>[http://cts.perseids.org/read/greekLit/tlg2048/tlg001/1st1K-grc1/1.6 Sozomenos, Ecclesiastical History, \u00a71.6]</ref>\n\n[[Zosimus]] wrote that after they left from the Aeetes, they arrived at the mouth of the [[Danube|Ister river]] which it discharges itself into the [[Black Sea]] and they went up that river against the stream, by the help of oars and convenient gales of wind. After they managed to do it, they built the city of Emona as a memorial of their arrival there. Afterwards placing the Argo, on machines they drew it as far as the sea-side and from there they went at the Thessalian shore.<ref>[https://topostext.org/work/740#5.29 Zosimus, New History, 5.29]</ref>\n\n[[Pliny the Elder]] wrote that some writers claim that the Argo came down some river into the Adriatic sea, not far from [[Tergeste]] but that river is now unknown. While other writers say that the ship was carried across the Alps on men's shoulders, having passed along the Ister river, then along the [[Savus]] river, and then to [[Nauportus]] which is lying between the Emona and the Alps.<ref>[https://topostext.org/work/148#3.22.1 Pliny the Elder, Natural History, \u00a73.22.1]</ref>\n\n==Adaptations of the myth==\n===Literature===\n* The ''[[Argonautica]]'' by [[Apollonius of Rhodes]], a 3rd-century BC Greek epic poem.\n* The ''Argonautica'' by [[Gaius Valerius Flaccus]], a 1st-century AD Latin epic poem.\n* ''The Life and Death of Jason'' (1867) by [[William Morris]]\n* ''Hercules, My Shipmate'' (1945) by [[Robert Graves]]\n* ''[[The Greek Myths]]'' (1955) by Robert Graves\n* ''Jason and Medeia'' (1975) by [[John Gardner (novelist)|John Gardner]], a modern, epic poem in English.\n* ''Despoiled Shore Medea Material Landscape with Argonauts'' (1982) - a play in the synthetic fragment form by [[Heiner M\u00fcller]]\n* ''The Argonauts'' (2015) by Maggie Nelson\n\n===Film and television===\n* The TV series ''[[Sea Hunt]]'' (1958\u201361) featured a yacht named the ''Argonaut.'' \n*''[[Jason and the Argonauts (1963 film)|Jason and the Argonauts]]'' (1963) - film directed by [[Don Chaffey]]\n* ''The Argonauts'' (1971) - Soviet cartoon\n* ''Das Goldene Ding'' (\"The Golden Thing\", 1972) German movie directed by [[Edgar Reitz]]\n* ''[[Underworld (Doctor Who)|Underworld]]'' (1977) - ''[[Doctor Who]]'' serial loosely based on the story of Jason and the Argonauts\n* ''The Merry Chronicle of the Dangerous Journey'' (''[[:ru:\u0412\u0435\u0441\u0451\u043b\u0430\u044f \u0445\u0440\u043e\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u043e\u043f\u0430\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043f\u0443\u0442\u0435\u0448\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0438\u044f|\u0412\u0435\u0441\u0451\u043b\u0430\u044f \u0445\u0440\u043e\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u043e\u043f\u0430\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043f\u0443\u0442\u0435\u0448\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0438\u044f]]'') - a 1986 Soviet musical.\n* ''[[Class of the Titans]]'' (2005-2008) - A Canadian animated TV series featuring a modern interpretation of the legend.\n* ''[[Atlantis (TV series)|Atlantis]]'' (2013) - television show developed by the BBC\n\n==See also==\n* [[Argo Navis]]\n* [[Argonaut Mine]]\n* [[Jason]] for more details on the quest for the Golden Fleece\n* [[Toronto Argonauts]], a Canadian Football League team\n* [[Argonaut Rowing Club]], a rowing club based out of Toronto\n* [[University of West Florida]]; the mascot of the University\n* [[Maggie Nelson]], The Argonauts\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n* [[Apollonius Rhodius]], ''[[Argonautica]]'' I, 23\u2013227\n* Pseudo-Apollodorus, ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]'' I, ix, 16.\n* [[Ken Inglis]], ''This is the ABC: The Australian Broadcasting Commission 1932\u20131983'', 2006\n\n==Further reading==\n* J.R.

There's an interesting contrast to be made between Five Days, the recent BBC drama broadcast in a strip of hour-long episodes that focused on police, and Five Daughters, where the detectives plodded and obeyed procedure and got lucky with some DNA.\"<ref name=Guardian/> Andrea Mullaney, meanwhile, said \"It's not just an interesting twist, of course\" [...] \"But it's also about redressing the wrong done to these victims, whose deaths meant that their lives were boiled down to the aspect they had in common, and which put them at risk: they worked as prostitutes and were, or had been, drug users.\"<ref name=Scotsman/>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{BBC programme}}\n*{{imdb title|1642351}}\n\n[[Category:Television series set in 2006]]\n[[Category:2010 British television series debuts]]\n[[Category:2010 British television series endings]]\n[[Category:2010s British drama television series]]\n[[Category:BBC television dramas]]\n[[Category:English-language television programs]]\n[[Category:Prostitution in British television]]\n[[Category:Ipswich]]\n[[Category:Television shows set in Suffolk]]\n", "name_user": "ZoomyWoo", "label": "safe", "comment": "Added content", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Daughters"}

Professional boxing bouts are fought for a [[purse bid|purse]] that is divided between the boxers as determined by contract. Most professional bouts are supervised by a regulatory authority to guarantee the fighters' safety. Most high-profile bouts obtain the endorsement of a sanctioning body, which awards championship belts, establishes rules, and assigns its own judges and referee.\n\nIn contrast with [[amateur boxing]], professional bouts are typically much longer and can last up to twelve rounds, though less significant fights can be as short as four rounds. Protective headgear is not permitted, and boxers are generally allowed to take substantial punishment before a fight is halted. Professional boxing has enjoyed a much higher profile than amateur boxing throughout the 20th century and beyond.\n\nIn Cuba professional boxing is banned (as of 2017).<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6237978.stm | work=BBC News | first=Jim | last=Fish | title=Boxers bounce back in Sweden | date=June 26, 2007}}</ref> So was also the case in Sweden between 1970 and 2007, and Norway between 1981 and 2014.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nrk.no/sport/forbudet-mot-proffboksing-i-norge-oppheves-1.12105739 | work=BBC News | first=Bj\u00f8rnar | last=Hjellen | title=Br\u00e6khus fikk dr\u00f8mmen oppfylt | date=December 16, 2014}}</ref>\n\n== Early history ==\n[[Image:Leonard Cushing Kinetograph 1894.ogv|thumb|300px|right|The June 1894 Leonard\u2013Cushing bout.

These rules specified more accurately the role of the officials, and produced a system of scoring that enabled the referee to decide the result of a fight. The [[British Boxing Board of Control]] (BBBofC) was first formed in 1919 with close links to the N.S.C., and was re-formed in 1929 after the N.S.C. closed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boxing-gyms.com/Evolution-of-professional-boxing.asp|title=boxing-gyms.com|work=boxing-gyms.com}}</ref>\n\nIn 1909, the first of twenty-two belts were presented by the fifth [[Earl of Lonsdale]] to the winner of a British title fight held at the N.S.C. In 1929, the BBBofC continued to award [[Lonsdale Belt]]s to any British boxer who won three title fights in the same weight division. The \"title fight\" has always been the focal point in professional boxing. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, however, there were title fights at each weight. Promoters who could stage profitable title fights became influential in the sport, as did boxers' managers. The best promoters and managers have been instrumental in bringing boxing to new audiences and provoking [[mass media|media]] and public interest. The most famous of all three-way partnership (fighter-manager-promoter) was that of [[Jack Dempsey]] (heavyweight champion 1919\u20131926), his manager [[Jack Kearns]], and the promoter [[Tex Rickard]]. Together they grossed US$8.4 million in only five fights between 1921 and 1927 and ushered in a \"golden age\" of popularity for professional boxing in the 1920s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boxrec.com/boxer_display.php?boxer_id=009009|title=Jack Dempsey - Boxer|work=boxrec.com}}</ref> They were also responsible for the first live radio broadcast of a title fight (Dempsey v. [[Georges Carpentier]], in 1921). In the United Kingdom, [[Jack Solomons]]' success as a fight promoter helped re-establish professional boxing after the Second World War and made the UK a popular place for title fights in the 1950s and 1960s.\n\n==Modern history==\n===1900 to 1920===\nIn the early twentieth century, most professional bouts took place in the United States and Britain, and champions were recognised by popular consensus as expressed in the newspapers of the day.  Among the great champions of the era were the peerless heavyweight [[James J. Jeffries|Jim Jeffries]] and [[Bob Fitzsimmons]], who weighed less than 12 stone (164 pounds),  but won world titles at middleweight (1892), light heavyweight (1903), and heavyweight (1897). Other famous champions included light heavyweight [[Philadelphia Jack O'Brien]] and middleweight [[Tommy Ryan]]. On May 12, 1902 lightweight Joe Gans became the first black American to be boxing champion.  Despite the public's enthusiasm, this was an era of far-reaching regulation of the sport, often with the stated goal of outright prohibition.  In 1900, the State of New York enacted the Lewis Law, banned prizefights except for those held in private athletic clubs between members.  Thus, when introducing the fighters, the announcer frequently added the phrase \"Both members of this club\", as George Wesley Bellows titled one of his paintings.<ref name=\"Rodriguez\">Robert G. Rodriguez. ''The regulation of boxing'', p32.  McFarland & Co., Jefferson, NC 2008</ref>  The western region of the United States tended to be more tolerant of prizefights in this era, although the private club arrangement was standard practice here as well, San Francisco's California Athletic Club being a prominent example.<ref name=\"Rodriguez\"/>\n\nOn December 26, 1908, heavyweight [[Jack Johnson (boxer)|Jack Johnson]] became the first black heavyweight champion and a highly controversial figure in that racially charged era.  Prizefights often had unlimited rounds, and could easily become endurance tests, favouring patient tacticians like Johnson.  At lighter weights, ten round fights were common, and lightweight [[Benny Leonard]] dominated his division from the late teens into the early twenties.\n\nPrizefighting champions in this period were the premier sports celebrities, and a championship event generated intense public interest. Long before bars became popular venues in which to watch sporting events on television, enterprising saloon keepers were known to set up ticker machines and announce the progress of an important bout, blow by blow. Local kids often hung about outside the saloon doors, hoping for news of the fight. Harpo Marx, then fifteen, recounted vicariously experiencing the 1904 Jeffries-Munroe championship fight in this way.<ref>''Harpo Speaks!'' pp 59-60. Limelight Editions, New York, 1961</ref>\n\n===1920 to 1940===\n{{main|Boxing in the 1920s|Boxing in the 1930s}}\n[[Image:Jack dempsey ring loc 50497v.jpg|thumb|250px|Jack Dempsey in the ring]]\nIn the 1920s, [[Boxing in the United States|prizefighting was the pre-eminent sport in the United States]], and no figure loomed larger than [[Jack Dempsey]], who became world heavyweight champion after brutally defeating [[Jess Willard]]. Dempsey was one of the hardest punchers of all time and as [[Bert Randolph Sugar]] put it, \"had a left hook from hell\". He is remembered for his iconic fight with [[Luis \u00c1ngel Firpo]], which was followed by a lavish life of celebrity away from the ring. The enormously popular Dempsey would conclude his career with a memorable two bouts with [[Gene Tunney]], breaking the $1 million gate threshold for the first time. Although Tunney dominated both fights, Dempsey retained the public's sympathy, especially after the controversy of a \"[[The Long Count Fight|long count]]\" in their second fight. This fight introduced the new rule that the counting of a downed opponent would not begin until the standing opponent went into a neutral corner. At this time, rules were negotiated by parties, as there were no sanctioning bodies.\n\nThe New York State Athletic Commission took a more prominent role in organizing fights in the 1930s. Famous champions of that era included the German heavyweight [[Max Schmeling]] and the American [[Max Baer (boxer)|Max Baer]], who wielded a devastating right hand.  Baer was defeated by \"Cinderella Man\" [[James J. Braddock|James Braddock]], a former light heavyweight contender before a series of injuries and setbacks during the Great Depression and was at one point even stripped of his license. Most famous of all was [[Joe Louis]], who avenged an earlier defeat by demolishing Schmeling in the first round of their 1938 rematch.  Louis was voted the best puncher of all time by ''[[The Ring (magazine)|The Ring]]'', and is arguably the greatest heavyweight of all time.  In 1938, [[Henry Armstrong]] became the only boxer to hold titles in three different weight classes at the same time (featherweight, lightweight, and welterweight). His attempt at winning the middleweight title would be thwarted in 1940.\n\n===1940 to 1960===\n{{main|Boxing in the 1940s|Boxing in the 1950s}}\nThe Second World War brought a lull in competitive boxing, and champion Louis fought mostly exhibitions.  After the war, Louis continued his reign, but new stars emerged in other divisions, such as the inimitable featherweight [[Willie Pep]], who won over 200 fights, and most notably [[Sugar Ray Robinson]], widely regarded as the greatest pound-for-pound fighter of all time. Robinson held the world welterweight title from 1946 to 1951 and the world middleweight title a record five times from 1951 to 1960.  His notable rivals included [[Jake LaMotta]], [[Gene Fullmer]], and [[Carmen Basilio]].  Unfortunately, many fights in the 1940s and 1950s were marred by suspected mafia involvement, though some fighters like Robinson and Basilio openly resisted mob influence.\n\nAmong the heavyweights, Joe Louis retained his title until his 1949 retirement, having held the championship for an unprecedented eleven years. [[Ezzard Charles]] and [[Jersey Joe Walcott]] succeeded him as champion, but they were soon outshone by the remarkable [[Rocky Marciano]], who compiled an astounding 49\u20130 record before retiring as world champion. Among his opponents was the ageless [[Archie Moore]], who held the world light heavyweight title for ten years and scored more knockout victories than any other boxer in history.\n\n===1960 to 1980===\n{{main|Boxing in the 1960s|Boxing in the 1970s}}\n[[File:Vitoria - Graffiti & Murals 0951.JPG|thumb|Graffiti of [[Muhammad Ali]]]]\nIn the early 1960s, the seemingly invincible [[Sonny Liston]] captured the public imagination with his one-sided destruction of two-time heavyweight champion [[Floyd Patterson]]. One of the last mob-connected fighters, Liston had his mystique shattered in two controversial losses to the brash upstart Cassius Clay, who changed his name to [[Muhammad Ali]] after becoming champion. Ali would become the most iconic figure in boxing history, transcending the sport and achieving global recognition.  His refusal to serve in the [[Vietnam War]] resulted in the stripping of his title, and tore down the barrier between sport and culture.\n\nAfter three years of inactivity, Ali returned to the sport, leading to his first epic clash with [[Joe Frazier]] in 1971, ushering in a \"golden age\" of heavyweight boxing.  Ali, Frazier, and the heavy-hitting [[George Foreman]] were the top fighters in a division overloaded with talent. Among the middleweights, Argentine [[Carlos Monz\u00f3n]] emerged as a dominant champion, reigning from 1970 to his retirement in 1977, after an unprecedented 14 title defenses. Roberto Dur\u00e1n dismantled opponents for 6\u00bd years as lightweight champion, Defending the title 12 times, 11 by knockout.\n\nThe late 1970s witnessed the end of universally recognised champions, as the WBC and WBA began to recognise different champions and top contenders, ushering in the era of multiple champions, unworthy mandatory challengers, and general corruption that came to be associated with sanctioning bodies in later decades.\n\nThe end of this decade also saw the sport begin to become more oriented toward the casino industry. The [[Caesars Palace]] hotel in [[Las Vegas]] began to host major bouts featuring [[George Foreman]], [[Ron Lyle]], [[Muhammad Ali]], [[Roberto Dur\u00e1n]], [[Sugar Ray Leonard]], [[Marvin Hagler]] and [[Thomas Hearns]]. Also, public broadcasts would be replaced by closed-circuit, and ultimately pay-per-view, broadcasts, as the boxing audience shrank in numbers.\n\n===1980 to 2000===\n{{main|Boxing in the 1980s|Boxing in the 1990s}}\nIn the early 1980s [[Larry Holmes]] was a lone heavyweight talent in a division full of pretenders, so the most compelling boxing matchups were to be found in the lower weight classes. [[Roberto Dur\u00e1n]] dominated the lightweight division and became welterweight champion, but quit during the 8th round in his second fight with [[Sugar Ray Leonard]] (the famous \"no mas\" fight of Nov. 1980), who emerged as the best fighter of the decade. Leonard went on to knock out the formidable [[Thomas Hearns]] in 1981. Meanwhile, the junior welterweight division was ruled by [[Aaron Pryor]], who made 10 title defenses from 1980 to 1985, before vacating the championship.\n\nThe prestigious middleweight division was dominated by \"Marvelous\" [[Marvin Hagler]], who fought [[Thomas Hearns]] at Caesars Palace on April 15, 1985. The fight was billed as \"The War\", and it lived up to its billing. As soon as the bell rang, both fighters ran towards the centre of the ring and began trading hooks and uppercuts nonstop. This continued into round three, when Hagler overwhelmed Hearns and knocked him out in brutal fashion. This fight made Hagler famous; he was able to lure Ray Leonard out of retirement in 1987, but lost in a highly-controversial{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} decision. Hagler retired from boxing immediately after that fight.\n\nIn the latter half of the decade young heavyweight [[Mike Tyson]] emerged as a serious contender. Nicknamed \"Iron Mike\", Tyson won the [[heavyweight unification series]] to become world heavyweight champion at the age of 20 and the first undisputed champion in a decade. Tyson soon became the most widely known boxer since Ali due to an aura of unrestrained ferocity, such as that exuded by Jack Dempsey or Sonny Liston.\n\nMuch like Liston, Tyson's career was marked by controversy and self-destruction. He was accused of domestic violence against his wife Robin Givens, whom he soon divorced. Meanwhile, he lost his title to 42-1 underdog [[James Douglas (boxer)|James Douglas]]. His progress toward another title shot was derailed by allegations of rape made by [[Desiree Washington]], a beauty pageant queen. In 1992 Tyson was imprisoned for rape, and released three years later. With Tyson removed from the heavyweight picture, [[Evander Holyfield]] and [[Riddick Bowe]] emerged as top heavyweights in the early nineties, facing each other in three bouts.\n\nMeanwhile, at light welterweight, Mexican [[Julio C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez]] compiled an official record of 89-0 before fighting to a controversial draw in 1993 with [[Pernell Whitaker]], who later also became a great boxer.  In the late 1990s Chavez was superseded by Olympic gold medalist [[Oscar De La Hoya]], who became the most popular pay-per-view draw of his era. De la Hoya won championships in six weight classes, competing with fighters including Chavez, Whitaker, and [[F\u00e9lix Trinidad]].\n\nIn the late 1990s Mike Tyson made a comeback, which took an unexpected turn when he was defeated by heavy underdog Evander Holyfield in 1996.  In their 1997 rematch, Tyson bit a chunk from Holyfield's ear, resulting in his disqualification; Tyson's boxing license was revoked by the [[Nevada State Athletic Commission]] for one year and he was fined US$3 million.  Holyfield won two of the three title belts, but lost a final match in 1999 with WBC champion [[Lennox Lewis]], who became undisputed champion.\n\n===2000 to present===\n{{main|Boxing in the 2000s|Boxing in the 2010s}}\nThe last decade has witnessed a continued decline in the popularity of boxing in the United States, marked by a malaise in the heavyweight division and the increased competition in the Pay-Per-View market from [[Mixed martial arts|MMA]] and its main promotion, the [[Ultimate Fighting Championship|UFC]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=jackson/080804|title=Jackson: Boxing's black eye - ESPN Page 2|work=go.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2011/nov/12/decline-heavyweight-boxing | work=The Guardian | title=No fighting against the painful decline in heavyweight boxing | date=2011-11-12 | accessdate=2012-02-25 | first1=Paul | last1=Hayward | location=London}}</ref> The sport has grown in Germany and Eastern Europe, and is also currently strong in Britain. This cultural shift is reflected in some of the changes in championship title holders, especially in the upper weight divisions.\n\nThe light heavyweight division was dominated in the early part of the decade by [[Roy Jones, Jr.]], a former middleweight champion, and the Polish-German [[Dariusz Michalczewski]].  Michalczewski held the [[WBO]] title, while Jones held the [[World Boxing Council|WBC]], [[World Boxing Association|WBA]], and [[IBF]] titles, two of which had been relinquished by Michalczewski.  The two fighters never met, due to a dispute over whether the fight would be held in the U.S. or in Germany.  This sort of dispute would be repeated among other top fighters, as Germany emerged as a top venue for world class boxing.\n\nThe Ukrainian [[Klitschko brothers]], [[Wladimir Klitschko|Wladimir]] and [[Vitali Klitschko|Vitali]], both of whom held versions of the heavyweight title.  The Klitschkos were often depicted as representing a new generation of fighters from ex-Soviet republics, possessing great size, yet considerable skill and stamina, developed by years of amateur experience.  Most versions of the heavyweight title were held by fighters from the former Soviet Union.\n\nSince the retirement of [[Lennox Lewis]] in 2004, the heavyweight division has been criticised as lacking talent or depth, especially among American fighters.  This has resulted in a higher profile for fighters in lower weight classes, including the age-defying middleweight and light heavyweight champion [[Bernard Hopkins]], and the undefeated multiple weight division champion [[Floyd Mayweather, Jr.]], who won a 2007 split decision over Oscar De La Hoya in a record-breaking pay-per-view event. Billed as the \"fight to save boxing\", the success of this event shows that American boxing still retains a considerable core audience when its product is of descent from the American continent.\n\nOther notable fighters in even lower weight classes are experiencing unprecedented popularity today. In the last five years junior lightweights [[Marco Antonio Barrera]], [[Erik Morales]], [[Juan Manuel M\u00e1rquez]] and multiple weight division champion [[Manny Pacquiao]] have fought numerous times on pay-per-view. These small fighters often display tremendous punching power for their size, producing exciting fights such as the incredible 2005 bout between Castillo and the late [[Diego Corrales]].\n\nInterest in the lower weight divisions further increased with the possibility of a superfight between two of the current best fighters in the world, [[Manny Pacquiao]] and [[Floyd Mayweather, Jr.]] Experts predicted this would break current pay-per-view records, due to the tremendous public demand for the fight. Long negotiations finally culminated in the [[Floyd Mayweather, Jr. vs. Manny Pacquiao|Mayweather-Pacquiao]] fight on May 2, 2015, six years after negotiation first began and resulted in estimated revenues of $450,000,000.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sbsun.com/sports/20150502/mayweather-pacquiaos-fight-of-the-century-fails-to-live-up-to-hype|title=Pacquino Mayweather fight|publisher=sbsun.com}}</ref>\n\n== Length of bouts ==\nProfessional bouts are limited to a maximum of twelve rounds, most are fought over four, six, eight or ten rounds depending upon the experience of the boxers.  Through the early twentieth century, it was common for fights to have unlimited rounds, ending only when one fighter quit or the fight was stopped by police.  In the 1910s and 1920s, a fifteen-round limit gradually became the norm, benefiting high-energy fighters like Jack Dempsey.\n\nFor decades, from the 1920s to the 1980s, world championship matches in professional boxing were scheduled for fifteen rounds, but that changed after a November 13, 1982 WBA Lightweight title bout ended with the death of boxer [[Duk Koo Kim]] in a fight against [[Ray Mancini]] in the 14th round of a nationally televised championship fight on CBS. Exactly three months after the fatal fight, the WBC reduced the number of their championship fights to 12 rounds. The WBA even stripped a fighter of his championship in 1983 because the fight had been a 15-round bout, shortly after the rule was changed to 12 rounds. By 1988, to the displeasure of some boxing purists, all fights had been reduced to a maximum of 12 rounds only, partially for safety, and partially for television, as a 12-round bout could be broadcast in a one-hour television block (pre-match, then the bout which lasts 48 minutes overall, decision, and interviews).  In contrast, a 15-round bout could require up to 90 minutes to broadcast (bout lasts 60 minutes, and both pre and post bout coverage including decision).\n\n== Scoring ==\nIf a knockout or disqualification does not occur, the fight is determined by a points decision. In the early days of boxing, the referee decided the winner by raising his arm at the end of the bout, a practice that is still used for some professional bouts in the United Kingdom.  In the early twentieth century, it became common for the referee or judge to score bouts by the number of rounds won. To improve the reliability of scoring, two ringside judges were added besides the referee, and the winner was decided by majority decision.  Since the late twentieth century, it has become common practice for all three judges to be ringside observers, though the referee still has the authority to stop a fight or deduct points.\n\nAt the end of the fight, the judges scores are tallied. If all three judges choose the same fighter as the winner, that fighter wins by ''unanimous decision''. If two judges have one boxer winning the fight and the third judge scores it a draw, the boxer wins by ''majority decision''.  If two judges have one boxer winning the fight and the third judge has the other boxer winning, the first boxer wins by ''split decision''. If one judge chooses one boxer as the winner, the second judge chooses the other boxer, and the third judge calls it a draw, then the bout is ruled a ''Split [[tie (draw)|draw]]''. The bout is also ruled a ''Majority Draw'' if at least two out of three judges score the fight a draw, regardless of the third score.  \n\n===10-Point system===\n{{anchor|10 Point System}}\nThe ''10 Point system'' was first introduced in 1968 by the [[World Boxing Council]] (WBC) as a rational way of scoring fights.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book | title=You be the boxing judge! : judging professional boxing for the TV boxing fan| last=Tom| first=Kaczmarek| date=1996| publisher=Dorrance Pub.

Furthermore, the subsequent adoption of this system, both nationally and internationally, allowed for greater judging consistency, which was something that was sorely needed at the time.<ref name=\":0\" />  There are many factors that inform the judge's decision but the most important of these are: clean punching, effective aggressiveness, ring generalship and defense. Judges use these metrics as a means of discerning which fighter has a clear advantage over the other, regardless of how minute the advantage.\n\n==== The Evolution of the 10-Point System ====\nModern [[boxing]] rules were initially derived from the [[Marquess of Queensberry Rules|Marquess of Queensbury rules]] which mainly outlined core aspects of the sport, such as the establishment of rounds and their duration, as well as the determination of proper attire in the ring such as gloves and [[Hand wrap|wraps]].<ref name=\":3\">{{cite journal |last1=Lee |first1=Herbert K.H |last2=Cork |first2=Daniel.L |last3=Algranati |first3=David.J |title=Did Lennox Lewis Beat Evander Holyfield?: Methods for Analysing Small Sample Interrater Agreement Problems. |journal=Journal of the Royal Statistical Society |date=2002 |volume=series D ( the statistician) |issue=51(2) |pages=129\u2013146 |jstor=3650314 }}</ref>  These rules did not, however, provide unified guidelines for scoring fights and instead left this in the hands of individual sanctioning organizations.  This meant that fights would be scored differently depending on the rules established by the governing body overseeing the fight.  It is from this environment that the 10-Point System was born.<ref name=\":0\" />   The adoption of this system, both nationally and internationally, established the foundation for greater judging consistency in professional boxing.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>[https/:www.lawinsport.com/topics/articles/item/ever-wondered-how-professional-boxing-s-scoring-system-works How it works]; </ref>\n\n==== How the System Works ====\nIn the event the winner of a bout cannot be determined by a [[knockout]], [[technical knockout]], or [[Disqualification (boxing)|disqualification]], the final decision rests in the hands of three ringside judges approved by the commission. The three judges are usually seated along the edge of the boxing [[Boxing ring|ring]], separated from each other. The judges are forbidden from sharing their scores with each other or consulting with one another.<ref name=\":3\" /> At the end of each round, judges must hand in their scores to the referee who then hands them to the clerk who records and totals the final scores.<ref name=\":3\" /> Judges are to award 10 points (less any point deductions) to the victor of the round and a lesser score (less any point deductions) to the loser. The losing contestant's score can vary depending on different factors.\n\nThe 10-point Must System is the most widely used scoring system since the mid-twentieth century. It is so named because a judge \"must\" award ten points to at least one fighter each round (before deductions for fouls).  Most rounds are scored 10\u20139, with 10 points for the fighter who won the round, and 9 points for the fighter the judge believes lost the round.  If a round is judged to be even, it is scored 10-10. For each knockdown in a round, the judge deducts an additional point from the fighter knocked down, resulting in a 10\u20138 score if there is one knockdown or a 10\u20137 score if there are two knockdowns.  If the referee instructs the judges to deduct a point for a foul, this deduction is applied after the preliminary computation. So, if a fighter wins a round, but is penalised for a foul, the score changes from 10\u20139 to 9-9.  If that same fighter scored a knockdown in the round, the score would change from 10\u20138 in his favour to 9\u20138. While uncommon, if a fighter completely dominates a round but does not score a knockdown, a judge can still score that round 10\u20138.\n  \nOther scoring systems have also been used in various locations, including the five-point must system (in which the winning fighter is awarded five points, the loser four or fewer), the one-point system (in which the winning fighter is awarded one or more points, and the losing fighter is awarded zero), and the rounds system which simply awards the round to the winning fighter. In the rounds system, the bout is won by the fighter determined to have won more rounds. This system often used a supplemental points system (generally the ten-point must) in the case of even rounds.\n\nIf a fight is stopped due to an injury that the referee has ruled to be the result of an unintentional foul, the fight goes to the scorecards only if a specified number of rounds (usually three, sometimes four) have been completed. Whoever is ahead on the scorecards wins by a technical decision. If the required number of rounds has not been completed, the fight is declared a technical draw or a no contest.\n\nIf a fight is stopped due to a cut resulting from a legal punch, the other participant is awarded a technical knockout win. For this reason, fighters often employ [[cutman|cutmen]], whose job is to treat cuts between rounds so that the boxer is able to continue despite the cut.<ref>Bert Randolph Sugar (2001).

If the referee declares a fighter going down to be a knockdown, the judges must score it as such.\n\n== Championships ==\n{{main|List of current world boxing champions}}\n\nIn the first part of the 20th century, the United States became the centre for professional boxing. It was generally accepted that the \"world champions\" were those listed by the ''[[National Police Gazette|Police Gazette]].''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9060614|title=The Police Gazette|work=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica}}</ref> After 1920, the [[National Boxing Association]], or NBA, began to sanction \"title fights.\" Also during that time, ''[[The Ring (magazine)|The Ring]]'' was founded, and it listed champions and awarded championship belts. The NBA was renamed in 1962 and became the [[World Boxing Association]], or WBA. The following year, a rival body, the [[World Boxing Council]], or WBC, was formed.<ref>Piero Pini and Professor Ram\u00f3n G. Vel\u00e1squez (2006).

In 1988, another world sanctioning body, the [[World Boxing Organization]], or WBO, was formed. In the 2010s a boxer had to be recognized by these four bodies to be the \"[[Undisputed champion|Undisputed]]\" World Champion; minor bodies like the [[International Boxing Organization]] and [[World Boxing Union]] are disregarded.  Regional sanctioning bodies such as the [[North American Boxing Federation]], the [[North American Boxing Council]] and the [[United States Boxing Association]] also awarded championships. ''The Ring'' Magazine also continued listing the World Champion of each weight division, and its rankings continue to be appreciated by fans.\n\n== Major sanctioning bodies ==\n{{see also|List of boxing organisations#Worldwide organisations}}\n* [[International Boxing Federation]] (IBF)\n* [[World Boxing Association]] (WBA)\n* [[World Boxing Council]] (WBC)\n* [[World Boxing Organization]] (WBO)\n\n==See also==\n*[[Amateur boxing]]\n\n==Citations==\n* [https://www.ontario.ca/page/combat-sports-professional-boxing-rules Combat sports: Professional boxing championship rules]; Government of Ontario.

Professional boxing bouts are fought for a [[purse bid|purse]] that is divided between the boxers as determined by contract. Most professional bouts are supervised by a regulatory authority to guarantee the fighters' safety. Most high-profile bouts obtain the endorsement of a sanctioning body, which awards championship belts, establishes rules, and assigns its own judges and referee.\n\nIn contrast with [[amateur boxing]], professional bouts are typically much longer and can last up to twelve rounds, though less significant fights can be as short as four rounds. Protective headgear is not permitted, and boxers are generally allowed to take substantial punishment before a fight is halted. Professional boxing has enjoyed a much higher profile than amateur boxing throughout the 20th century and beyond.\n\nIn Cuba professional boxing is banned (as of 2017).<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6237978.stm | work=BBC News | first=Jim | last=Fish | title=Boxers bounce back in Sweden | date=June 26, 2007}}</ref> So was also the case in Sweden between 1970 and 2007, and Norway between 1981 and 2014.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nrk.no/sport/forbudet-mot-proffboksing-i-norge-oppheves-1.12105739 | work=BBC News | first=Bj\u00f8rnar | last=Hjellen | title=Br\u00e6khus fikk dr\u00f8mmen oppfylt | date=December 16, 2014}}</ref>\n\n== Early history ==\n[[Image:Leonard Cushing Kinetograph 1894.ogv|thumb|300px|right|The June 1894 Leonard\u2013Cushing bout.

These rules specified more accurately the role of the officials, and produced a system of scoring that enabled the referee to decide the result of a fight. The [[British Boxing Board of Control]] (BBBofC) was first formed in 1919 with close links to the N.S.C., and was re-formed in 1929 after the N.S.C. closed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boxing-gyms.com/Evolution-of-professional-boxing.asp|title=boxing-gyms.com|work=boxing-gyms.com}}</ref>\n\nIn 1909, the first of twenty-two belts were presented by the fifth [[Earl of Lonsdale]] to the winner of a British title fight held at the N.S.C. In 1929, the BBBofC continued to award [[Lonsdale Belt]]s to any British boxer who won three title fights in the same weight division. The \"title fight\" has always been the focal point in professional boxing. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, however, there were title fights at each weight. Promoters who could stage profitable title fights became influential in the sport, as did boxers' managers. The best promoters and managers have been instrumental in bringing boxing to new audiences and provoking [[mass media|media]] and public interest. The most famous of all three-way partnership (fighter-manager-promoter) was that of [[Jack Dempsey]] (heavyweight champion 1919\u20131926), his manager [[Jack Kearns]], and the promoter [[Tex Rickard]]. Together they grossed US$8.4 million in only five fights between 1921 and 1927 and ushered in a \"golden age\" of popularity for professional boxing in the 1920s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boxrec.com/boxer_display.php?boxer_id=009009|title=Jack Dempsey - Boxer|work=boxrec.com}}</ref> They were also responsible for the first live radio broadcast of a title fight (Dempsey v. [[Georges Carpentier]], in 1921). In the United Kingdom, [[Jack Solomons]]' success as a fight promoter helped re-establish professional boxing after the Second World War and made the UK a popular place for title fights in the 1950s and 1960s.\n\n==Modern history==\n===1900 to 1920===\nIn the early twentieth century, most professional bouts took place in the United States and Britain, and champions were recognised by popular consensus as expressed in the newspapers of the day.  Among the great champions of the era were the peerless heavyweight [[James J. Jeffries|Jim Jeffries]] and [[Bob Fitzsimmons]], who weighed less than 12 stone (164 pounds),  but won world titles at middleweight (1892), light heavyweight (1903), and heavyweight (1897). Other famous champions included light heavyweight [[Philadelphia Jack O'Brien]] and middleweight [[Tommy Ryan]]. On May 12, 1902 lightweight Joe Gans became the first black American to be boxing champion.  Despite the public's enthusiasm, this was an era of far-reaching regulation of the sport, often with the stated goal of outright prohibition.  In 1900, the State of New York enacted the Lewis Law, banned prizefights except for those held in private athletic clubs between members.  Thus, when introducing the fighters, the announcer frequently added the phrase \"Both members of this club\", as George Wesley Bellows titled one of his paintings.<ref name=\"Rodriguez\">Robert G. Rodriguez. ''The regulation of boxing'', p32.  McFarland & Co., Jefferson, NC 2008</ref>  The western region of the United States tended to be more tolerant of prizefights in this era, although the private club arrangement was standard practice here as well, San Francisco's California Athletic Club being a prominent example.<ref name=\"Rodriguez\"/>\n\nOn December 26, 1908, heavyweight [[Jack Johnson (boxer)|Jack Johnson]] became the first black heavyweight champion and a highly controversial figure in that racially charged era.  Prizefights often had unlimited rounds, and could easily become endurance tests, favouring patient tacticians like Johnson.  At lighter weights, ten round fights were common, and lightweight [[Benny Leonard]] dominated his division from the late teens into the early twenties.\n\nPrizefighting champions in this period were the premier sports celebrities, and a championship event generated intense public interest. Long before bars became popular venues in which to watch sporting events on television, enterprising saloon keepers were known to set up ticker machines and announce the progress of an important bout, blow by blow. Local kids often hung about outside the saloon doors, hoping for news of the fight. Harpo Marx, then fifteen, recounted vicariously experiencing the 1904 Jeffries-Munroe championship fight in this way.<ref>''Harpo Speaks!'' pp 59-60. Limelight Editions, New York, 1961</ref>\n\n===1920 to 1940===\n{{main|Boxing in the 1920s|Boxing in the 1930s}}\n[[Image:Jack dempsey ring loc 50497v.jpg|thumb|250px|Jack Dempsey in the ring]]\nIn the 1920s, [[Boxing in the United States|prizefighting was the pre-eminent sport in the United States]], and no figure loomed larger than [[Jack Dempsey]], who became world heavyweight champion after brutally defeating [[Jess Willard]]. Dempsey was one of the hardest punchers of all time and as [[Bert Randolph Sugar]] put it, \"had a left hook from hell\". He is remembered for his iconic fight with [[Luis \u00c1ngel Firpo]], which was followed by a lavish life of celebrity away from the ring. The enormously popular Dempsey would conclude his career with a memorable two bouts with [[Gene Tunney]], breaking the $1 million gate threshold for the first time. Although Tunney dominated both fights, Dempsey retained the public's sympathy, especially after the controversy of a \"[[The Long Count Fight|long count]]\" in their second fight. This fight introduced the new rule that the counting of a downed opponent would not begin until the standing opponent went into a neutral corner. At this time, rules were negotiated by parties, as there were no sanctioning bodies.\n\nThe New York State Athletic Commission took a more prominent role in organizing fights in the 1930s. Famous champions of that era included the German heavyweight [[Max Schmeling]] and the American [[Max Baer (boxer)|Max Baer]], who wielded a devastating right hand.  Baer was defeated by \"Cinderella Man\" [[James J. Braddock|James Braddock]], a former light heavyweight contender before a series of injuries and setbacks during the Great Depression and was at one point even stripped of his license. Most famous of all was [[Joe Louis]], who avenged an earlier defeat by demolishing Schmeling in the first round of their 1938 rematch.  Louis was voted the best puncher of all time by ''[[The Ring (magazine)|The Ring]]'', and is arguably the greatest heavyweight of all time.  In 1938, [[Henry Armstrong]] became the only boxer to hold titles in three different weight classes at the same time (featherweight, lightweight, and welterweight). His attempt at winning the middleweight title would be thwarted in 1940.\n\n===1940 to 1960===\n{{main|Boxing in the 1940s|Boxing in the 1950s}}\nThe Second World War brought a lull in competitive boxing, and champion Louis fought mostly exhibitions.  After the war, Louis continued his reign, but new stars emerged in other divisions, such as the inimitable featherweight [[Willie Pep]], who won over 200 fights, and most notably [[Sugar Ray Robinson]], widely regarded as the greatest pound-for-pound fighter of all time. Robinson held the world welterweight title from 1946 to 1951 and the world middleweight title a record five times from 1951 to 1960.  His notable rivals included [[Jake LaMotta]], [[Gene Fullmer]], and [[Carmen Basilio]].  Unfortunately, many fights in the 1940s and 1950s were marred by suspected mafia involvement, though some fighters like Robinson and Basilio openly resisted mob influence.\n\nAmong the heavyweights, Joe Louis retained his title until his 1949 retirement, having held the championship for an unprecedented eleven years. [[Ezzard Charles]] and [[Jersey Joe Walcott]] succeeded him as champion, but they were soon outshone by the remarkable [[Rocky Marciano]], who compiled an astounding 49-0 record before retiring as world champion. Among his opponents was the ageless [[Archie Moore]], who held the world light heavyweight title for ten years and scored more knockout victories than any other boxer in history.\n\n===1960 to 1980===\n{{main|Boxing in the 1960s|Boxing in the 1970s}}\n[[File:Vitoria - Graffiti & Murals 0951.JPG|thumb|Graffiti of [[Muhammad Ali]]]]\nIn the early 1960s, the seemingly invincible [[Sonny Liston]] captured the public imagination with his one-sided destruction of two-time heavyweight champion [[Floyd Patterson]]. One of the last mob-connected fighters, Liston had his mystique shattered in two controversial losses to the brash upstart Cassius Clay, who changed his name to [[Muhammad Ali]] after becoming champion. Ali would become the most iconic figure in boxing history, transcending the sport and achieving global recognition.  His refusal to serve in the [[Vietnam War]] resulted in the stripping of his title, and tore down the barrier between sport and culture.\n\nAfter three years of inactivity, Ali returned to the sport, leading to his first epic clash with [[Joe Frazier]] in 1971, ushering in a \"golden age\" of heavyweight boxing.  Ali, Frazier, and the heavy-hitting [[George Foreman]] were the top fighters in a division overloaded with talent. Among the middleweights, Argentine [[Carlos Monz\u00f3n]] emerged as a dominant champion, reigning from 1970 to his retirement in 1977, after an unprecedented 14 title defenses. Roberto Dur\u00e1n dismantled opponents for 6\u00bd years as lightweight champion, Defending the title 12 times, 11 by knockout.\n\nThe late 1970s witnessed the end of universally recognised champions, as the WBC and WBA began to recognise different champions and top contenders, ushering in the era of multiple champions, unworthy mandatory challengers, and general corruption that came to be associated with sanctioning bodies in later decades.\n\nThe end of this decade also saw the sport begin to become more oriented toward the casino industry. The [[Caesars Palace]] hotel in [[Las Vegas]] began to host major bouts featuring [[George Foreman]], [[Ron Lyle]], [[Muhammad Ali]], [[Roberto Dur\u00e1n]], [[Sugar Ray Leonard]], [[Marvin Hagler]] and [[Thomas Hearns]]. Also, public broadcasts would be replaced by closed-circuit, and ultimately pay-per-view, broadcasts, as the boxing audience shrank in numbers.\n\n===1980 to 2000===\n{{main|Boxing in the 1980s|Boxing in the 1990s}}\nIn the early 1980s [[Larry Holmes]] was a lone heavyweight talent in a division full of pretenders, so the most compelling boxing matchups were to be found in the lower weight classes. [[Roberto Dur\u00e1n]] dominated the lightweight division and became welterweight champion, but quit during the 8th round in his second fight with [[Sugar Ray Leonard]] (the famous \"no mas\" fight of Nov. 1980), who emerged as the best fighter of the decade. Leonard went on to knock out the formidable [[Thomas Hearns]] in 1981. Meanwhile, the junior welterweight division was ruled by [[Aaron Pryor]], who made 10 title defenses from 1980 to 1985, before vacating the championship.\n\nThe prestigious middleweight division was dominated by \"Marvelous\" [[Marvin Hagler]], who fought [[Thomas Hearns]] at Caesars Palace on April 15, 1985. The fight was billed as \"The War\", and it lived up to its billing. As soon as the bell rang, both fighters ran towards the centre of the ring and began trading hooks and uppercuts nonstop. This continued into round three, when Hagler overwhelmed Hearns and knocked him out in brutal fashion. This fight made Hagler famous; he was able to lure Ray Leonard out of retirement in 1987, but lost in a highly-controversial{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} decision. Hagler retired from boxing immediately after that fight.\n\nIn the latter half of the decade young heavyweight [[Mike Tyson]] emerged as a serious contender. Nicknamed \"Iron Mike\", Tyson won the [[heavyweight unification series]] to become world heavyweight champion at the age of 20 and the first undisputed champion in a decade. Tyson soon became the most widely known boxer since Ali due to an aura of unrestrained ferocity, such as that exuded by Jack Dempsey or Sonny Liston.\n\nMuch like Liston, Tyson's career was marked by controversy and self-destruction. He was accused of domestic violence against his wife Robin Givens, whom he soon divorced. Meanwhile, he lost his title to 42-1 underdog [[James Douglas (boxer)|James Douglas]]. His progress toward another title shot was derailed by allegations of rape made by [[Desiree Washington]], a beauty pageant queen. In 1992 Tyson was imprisoned for rape, and released three years later. With Tyson removed from the heavyweight picture, [[Evander Holyfield]] and [[Riddick Bowe]] emerged as top heavyweights in the early nineties, facing each other in three bouts.\n\nMeanwhile, at light welterweight, Mexican [[Julio C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez]] compiled an official record of 89-0 before fighting to a controversial draw in 1993 with [[Pernell Whitaker]], who later also became a great boxer.  In the late 1990s Chavez was superseded by Olympic gold medalist [[Oscar De La Hoya]], who became the most popular pay-per-view draw of his era. De la Hoya won championships in six weight classes, competing with fighters including Chavez, Whitaker, and [[F\u00e9lix Trinidad]].\n\nIn the late 1990s Mike Tyson made a comeback, which took an unexpected turn when he was defeated by heavy underdog Evander Holyfield in 1996.  In their 1997 rematch, Tyson bit a chunk from Holyfield's ear, resulting in his disqualification; Tyson's boxing license was revoked by the [[Nevada State Athletic Commission]] for one year and he was fined US$3 million.  Holyfield won two of the three title belts, but lost a final match in 1999 with WBC champion [[Lennox Lewis]], who became undisputed champion.\n\n===2000 to present===\n{{main|Boxing in the 2000s|Boxing in the 2010s}}\nThe last decade has witnessed a continued decline in the popularity of boxing in the United States, marked by a malaise in the heavyweight division and the increased competition in the Pay-Per-View market from [[Mixed martial arts|MMA]] and its main promotion, the [[Ultimate Fighting Championship|UFC]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=jackson/080804|title=Jackson: Boxing's black eye - ESPN Page 2|work=go.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2011/nov/12/decline-heavyweight-boxing | work=The Guardian | title=No fighting against the painful decline in heavyweight boxing | date=2011-11-12 | accessdate=2012-02-25 | first1=Paul | last1=Hayward | location=London}}</ref> The sport has grown in Germany and Eastern Europe, and is also currently strong in Britain. This cultural shift is reflected in some of the changes in championship title holders, especially in the upper weight divisions.\n\nThe light heavyweight division was dominated in the early part of the decade by [[Roy Jones, Jr.]], a former middleweight champion, and the Polish-German [[Dariusz Michalczewski]].  Michalczewski held the [[WBO]] title, while Jones held the [[World Boxing Council|WBC]], [[World Boxing Association|WBA]], and [[IBF]] titles, two of which had been relinquished by Michalczewski.  The two fighters never met, due to a dispute over whether the fight would be held in the U.S. or in Germany.  This sort of dispute would be repeated among other top fighters, as Germany emerged as a top venue for world class boxing.\n\nThe Ukrainian [[Klitschko brothers]], [[Wladimir Klitschko|Wladimir]] and [[Vitali Klitschko|Vitali]], both of whom held versions of the heavyweight title.  The Klitschkos were often depicted as representing a new generation of fighters from ex-Soviet republics, possessing great size, yet considerable skill and stamina, developed by years of amateur experience.  Most versions of the heavyweight title were held by fighters from the former Soviet Union.\n\nSince the retirement of [[Lennox Lewis]] in 2004, the heavyweight division has been criticised as lacking talent or depth, especially among American fighters.  This has resulted in a higher profile for fighters in lower weight classes, including the age-defying middleweight and light heavyweight champion [[Bernard Hopkins]], and the undefeated multiple weight division champion [[Floyd Mayweather, Jr.]], who won a 2007 split decision over Oscar De La Hoya in a record-breaking pay-per-view event. Billed as the \"fight to save boxing\", the success of this event shows that American boxing still retains a considerable core audience when its product is of descent from the American continent.\n\nOther notable fighters in even lower weight classes are experiencing unprecedented popularity today. In the last five years junior lightweights [[Marco Antonio Barrera]], [[Erik Morales]], [[Juan Manuel M\u00e1rquez]] and multiple weight division champion [[Manny Pacquiao]] have fought numerous times on pay-per-view. These small fighters often display tremendous punching power for their size, producing exciting fights such as the incredible 2005 bout between Castillo and the late [[Diego Corrales]].\n\nInterest in the lower weight divisions further increased with the possibility of a superfight between two of the current best fighters in the world, [[Manny Pacquiao]] and [[Floyd Mayweather, Jr.]] Experts predicted this would break current pay-per-view records, due to the tremendous public demand for the fight. Long negotiations finally culminated in the [[Floyd Mayweather, Jr. vs. Manny Pacquiao|Mayweather-Pacquiao]] fight on May 2, 2015, six years after negotiation first began and resulted in estimated revenues of $450,000,000.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sbsun.com/sports/20150502/mayweather-pacquiaos-fight-of-the-century-fails-to-live-up-to-hype|title=Pacquino Mayweather fight|publisher=sbsun.com}}</ref>\n\n== Length of bouts ==\nProfessional bouts are limited to a maximum of twelve rounds, most are fought over four, six, eight or ten rounds depending upon the experience of the boxers.  Through the early twentieth century, it was common for fights to have unlimited rounds, ending only when one fighter quit or the fight was stopped by police.  In the 1910s and 1920s, a fifteen-round limit gradually became the norm, benefiting high-energy fighters like Jack Dempsey.\n\nFor decades, from the 1920s to the 1980s, world championship matches in professional boxing were scheduled for fifteen rounds, but that changed after a November 13, 1982 WBA Lightweight title bout ended with the death of boxer [[Duk Koo Kim]] in a fight against [[Ray Mancini]] in the 14th round of a nationally televised championship fight on CBS. Exactly three months after the fatal fight, the WBC reduced the number of their championship fights to 12 rounds. The WBA even stripped a fighter of his championship in 1983 because the fight had been a 15-round bout, shortly after the rule was changed to 12 rounds. By 1988, to the displeasure of some boxing purists, all fights had been reduced to a maximum of 12 rounds only, partially for safety, and partially for television, as a 12-round bout could be broadcast in a one hour television block (pre-match, then the bout which lasts 48 minutes overall, decision, and interviews).  In contrast, a 15-round bout could require up to 90 minutes to broadcast (bout lasts 60 minutes, and both pre and post bout coverage including decision).\n\n== Scoring ==\nIf a knockout or disqualification does not occur, the fight is determined by a points decision. In the early days of boxing, the referee decided the winner by raising his arm at the end of the bout, a practice that is still used for some professional bouts in the United Kingdom.  In the early twentieth century, it became common for the referee or judge to score bouts by the number of rounds won. To improve the reliability of scoring, two ringside judges were added besides the referee, and the winner was decided by majority decision.  Since the late twentieth century, it has become common practice for all three judges to be ringside observers, though the referee still has the authority to stop a fight or deduct points.\n\nAt the end of the fight, the judges scores are tallied. If all three judges choose the same fighter as the winner, that fighter wins by ''unanimous decision''. If two judges have one boxer winning the fight and the third judge scores it a draw, the boxer wins by ''majority decision''.  If two judges have one boxer winning the fight and the third judge has the other boxer winning, the first boxer wins by ''split decision''. If one judge chooses one boxer as the winner, the second judge chooses the other boxer, and the third judge calls it a draw, then the bout is ruled a ''Split [[tie (draw)|draw]]''. The bout is also ruled a ''Majority Draw'' if at least two out of three judges score the fight a draw, regardless of the third score.  \n\n===10-Point system===\n{{anchor|10 Point System}}\nThe ''10 Point system'' was first introduced in 1968 by the [[World Boxing Council]] (WBC) as a rational way of scoring fights.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book | title=You be the boxing judge! : judging professional boxing for the TV boxing fan| last=Tom| first=Kaczmarek| date=1996| publisher=Dorrance Pub. Co| isbn=978-0805939033| location=Pittsburgh, Pa.| oclc=39257557}}</ref>  It was viewed as such because it allowed judges to reward [[Knockdown (boxing)|knockdowns]] and distinguish between close rounds, as well as rounds where one fighter clearly dominated their opponent.  Furthermore, the subsequent adoption of this system, both nationally and internationally, allowed for greater judging consistency, which was something that was sorely needed at the time.<ref name=\":0\" />  There are many factors that inform the judge's decision but the most important of these are: clean punching, effective aggressiveness, ring generalship and defense. Judges use these metrics as a means of discerning which fighter has a clear advantage over the other, regardless of how minute the advantage.\n\n==== The Evolution of the 10-Point System ====\nModern [[boxing]] rules were initially derived from the [[Marquess of Queensberry Rules|Marquess of Queensbury rules]] which mainly outlined core aspects of the sport, such as the establishment of rounds and their duration, as well as the determination of proper attire in the ring such as gloves and [[Hand wrap|wraps]].<ref name=\":3\">{{cite journal |last1=Lee |first1=Herbert K.H |last2=Cork |first2=Daniel.L |last3=Algranati |first3=David.J |title=Did Lennox Lewis Beat Evander Holyfield?: Methods for Analysing Small Sample Interrater Agreement Problems. |journal=Journal of the Royal Statistical Society |date=2002 |volume=series D ( the statistician) |issue=51(2) |pages=129\u2013146 |jstor=3650314 }}</ref>  These rules did not, however, provide unified guidelines for scoring fights and instead left this in the hands of individual sanctioning organizations.  This meant that fights would be scored differently depending on the rules established by the governing body overseeing the fight.  It is from this environment that the 10-Point System was born.<ref name=\":0\" />   The adoption of this system, both nationally and internationally, established the foundation for greater judging consistency in professional boxing.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>[https/:www.lawinsport.com/topics/articles/item/ever-wondered-how-professional-boxing-s-scoring-system-works How it works]; </ref>\n\n==== How the System Works ====\nIn the event the winner of a bout cannot be determined by a [[knockout]], [[technical knockout]], or [[Disqualification (boxing)|disqualification]], the final decision rests in the hands of three ringside judges approved by the commission. The three judges are usually seated along the edge of the boxing [[Boxing ring|ring]], separated from each other. The judges are forbidden from sharing their scores with each other or consulting with one another.<ref name=\":3\" /> At the end of each round, judges must hand in their scores to the referee who then hands them to the clerk who records and totals the final scores.<ref name=\":3\" /> Judges are to award 10 points (less any point deductions) to the victor of the round and a lesser score (less any point deductions) to the loser. The losing contestant's score can vary depending on different factors.\n\nThe 10-point Must System is the most widely used scoring system since the mid-twentieth century. It is so named because a judge \"must\" award ten points to at least one fighter each round (before deductions for fouls).  Most rounds are scored 10-9, with 10 points for the fighter who won the round, and 9 points for the fighter the judge believes lost the round.  If a round is judged to be even, it is scored 10-10. For each knockdown in a round, the judge deducts an additional point from the fighter knocked down, resulting in a 10-8 score if there is one knockdown or a 10-7 score if there are two knockdowns.  If the referee instructs the judges to deduct a point for a foul, this deduction is applied after the preliminary computation. So, if a fighter wins a round, but is penalised for a foul, the score changes from 10-9 to 9-9.  If that same fighter scored a knockdown in the round, the score would change from 10-8 in his favour to 9-8. While uncommon, if a fighter completely dominates a round but does not score a knockdown, a judge can still score that round 10-8.\n  \nOther scoring systems have also been used in various locations, including the five-point must system (in which the winning fighter is awarded five points, the loser four or fewer), the one-point system (in which the winning fighter is awarded one or more points, and the losing fighter is awarded zero), and the rounds system which simply awards the round to the winning fighter. In the rounds system, the bout is won by the fighter determined to have won more rounds. This system often used a supplemental points system (generally the ten-point must) in the case of even rounds.\n\nIf a fight is stopped due to an injury that the referee has ruled to be the result of an unintentional foul, the fight goes to the scorecards only if a specified number of rounds (usually three, sometimes four) have been completed. Whoever is ahead on the scorecards wins by a technical decision. If the required number of rounds has not been completed, the fight is declared a technical draw or a no contest.\n\nIf a fight is stopped due to a cut resulting from a legal punch, the other participant is awarded a technical knockout win. For this reason, fighters often employ [[cutman|cutmen]], whose job is to treat cuts between rounds so that the boxer is able to continue despite the cut.<ref>Bert Randolph Sugar (2001).

If the referee declares a fighter going down to be a knockdown, the judges must score it as such.\n\n== Championships ==\n{{main|List of current world boxing champions}}\n\nIn the first part of the 20th century, the United States became the centre for professional boxing. It was generally accepted that the \"world champions\" were those listed by the ''[[National Police Gazette|Police Gazette]].''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9060614|title=The Police Gazette|work=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica}}</ref> After 1920, the [[National Boxing Association]], or NBA, began to sanction \"title fights.\" Also during that time, ''[[The Ring (magazine)|The Ring]]'' was founded, and it listed champions and awarded championship belts. The NBA was renamed in 1962 and became the [[World Boxing Association]], or WBA. The following year, a rival body, the [[World Boxing Council]], or WBC, was formed.<ref>Piero Pini and Professor Ram\u00f3n G. Vel\u00e1squez (2006).

In 1988, another world sanctioning body, the [[World Boxing Organization]], or WBO, was formed. In the 2010s a boxer had to be recognized by these four bodies to be the \"[[Undisputed champion|Undisputed]]\" World Champion; minor bodies like the [[International Boxing Organization]] and [[World Boxing Union]] are disregarded.  Regional sanctioning bodies such as the [[North American Boxing Federation]], the [[North American Boxing Council]] and the [[United States Boxing Association]] also awarded championships. ''The Ring'' Magazine also continued listing the World Champion of each weight division, and its rankings continue to be appreciated by fans.\n\n== Major sanctioning bodies ==\n{{see also|List of boxing organisations#Worldwide organisations}}\n* [[International Boxing Federation]] (IBF)\n* [[World Boxing Association]] (WBA)\n* [[World Boxing Council]] (WBC)\n* [[World Boxing Organization]] (WBO)\n\n==See also==\n*[[Amateur boxing]]\n\n==Citations==\n* [https://www.ontario.ca/page/combat-sports-professional-boxing-rules Combat sports: Professional boxing championship rules]; Government of Ontario.

{"title_page": "Professional football (gridiron)", "text_new": "{{More citations needed|date=April 2019}}\n\nIn the United States and Canada, the term '''professional football''' includes the professional forms of [[American football|American]] and [[Canadian football|Canadian]] [[gridiron football]].  In common usage, it refers to former and existing major football leagues in either country.  Currently, there are multiple professional football leagues in North America: the three best known are the [[National Football League]] (NFL) and the [[Arena Football League]] (AFL) in the U.S. and the [[Canadian Football League]] (CFL) in Canada.  The NFL has existed continuously since being so named in 1922.\n\n==Organization==\nCompared to the other [[major professional sports leagues of the United States and Canada]], football has comparatively few levels of play and does not have a well-developed [[minor league]] system or [[League system|pyramid]], either official or otherwise.\n\nIn North America, the top level of professional football is the [[National Football League]], with the [[Canadian Football League]] second to the NFL in prominence and pay grade. Despite the lower level of pay, the CFL has greater popularity in Canada because of its long history in the country, the NFL's limited presence in Canada, and a general environment of [[Canadian cultural protectionism]].\n\n[[Indoor American football|Indoor football]] has also developed in the United States, beginning with the [[Arena Football League]], which formed in 1987. The AFL is the second longest running professional football league in the United States after the NFL, although its current incarnation is a separate entity from the original, which folded due to bankruptcy in 2008. From its debut until 1997, the Arena Football League operated with a monopoly on the indoor game, due to a broad interpretation that virtually all of the league's rules, collectively known as [[arena football]], were covered under its patent; the [[Professional Indoor Football League (1998)|Professional Indoor Football League]] successfully defeated the AFL's legal action against it in 1997, opening the possibility for other indoor football leagues to form. Only one significant aspect of the patent, the large rebound nets the AFL has used since its debut to keep balls in play, was fully protected; the patent expired in 2007, although no other professional indoor league has adopted rebound nets since. As of 2011, two national leagues (the AFL and the [[Indoor Football League]]), along with several regional professional and semi-pro leagues, are in operation. As of 2011, no professional indoor football league has had any significant presence in Canada (despite an abundance of hockey arenas that are ideal for the game); only one indoor team, the AFL's short-lived [[Toronto Phantoms]] (2000 to 2002), has ever played its games in Canada. The all-female [[Lingerie Football League]] had operations in Canada from 2011 to 2014, but that league dropped to amateur level by the time the LFL entered the country.\n\nUp until the 1970s, semiprofessional and minor football leagues would often develop lower end players into professional prospects. Though there are still numerous teams at the semi-pro level in both the United States and Canada, they have mostly dropped to regional amateur status, and they no longer develop professional prospects, in part due to the rise of indoor football.\n\nThough Japan ([[X-League]]) and Europe ([[Austrian Football League]] and [[German Football League]]) have professional football leagues composed primarily of national citizens along with a limited number of American Imports, these leagues are generally of a lower level of play than the Western Hemisphere counterparts and have only recently begun contributing players to the American leagues on a regular basis.\n\n===Player development===\n\nProfessional football is considered the highest level of competition in gridiron football. Whereas most of the other major sports leagues draw their players from the minor leagues, the NFL currently draws almost all of its players directly from [[college football]]. College football, in turn, recruits players from [[high school football]], with most potential stars receiving scholarships to play. The source for the vast majority of professional football players is the [[Division I Bowl Subdivision]], with most coming from the five conferences with automatic bids into the [[College Football Playoff]] [[bowl game]]s. Under current regulations, players must be at least three years removed from high school graduation to qualify to play in the NFL. Because of these barriers, players who do not play college football have very few options for breaking into the league.\n\nThe college football development system is a unique feature in the professional football system, stemming from the fact that the game of American football originated at the college level, unlike other sports that were products of independent clubs. Although ostensibly amateurs, college athletes are compensated with five years of free undergraduate college education (more than enough time to pursue a [[bachelor's degree]]), room and board for their time. As a result of the college system, first-time players (rookies) enter professional football older, more mature and more prepared for the professional game than players in other sports.\n\nThe Canadian Football League has a special requirement that a minimum of half of each team's roster be composed of persons who were Canadian citizens at the time they first joined the league (prior to 2014, the restrictions were much tighter in that the person also had to be resident in Canada since childhood). As such, [[Canadian Interuniversity Sport]] feeds players to the CFL to meet these quotas, much as the NCAA does in the United States. The remaining half of the roster may be filled by either Canadians or by ''internationals'' (formerly ''imports''; these are typically American players who play in the CFL).\n\nThe NFL has, over the course of its history, recruited [[rugby union]], [[association football]] and [[Australian rules football]] players from other countries (particularly those who are retired from competition in their home countries) to play in the league, almost always as kickers and punters.\n\n==Broadcasting==\nBroadcasting is an integral part of professional football. Not only does it provide the sport with exposure to an audience wider than just the audience attending at the stadium, but it can also provide revenue in the form of rights fees.\n\nThe NFL relies on television for nearly half of its revenue; this is in part because the league only plays one game each week, leaving fewer opportunities for ticket sales than the other professional sports (in turn, however, NFL stadiums have among the highest per-game attendance thanks to large stadium capacities, figures only exceeded or matched by some of the major college football teams and by the [[NASCAR Sprint Cup]], both of which are also weekly events) and because the expense of the game (it has the largest rosters of any professional sport) makes the cost highly prohibitive. The NFL has sold broadcast rights to each of the [[Big Three television networks|major television networks]], who pay large annual fees on top of the cost of production for the rights to air the game. The networks make back much of their money through advertising and [[retransmission consent]] fees. The use of multiple broadcasters dated to before the NFL's merger with the [[American Football League]]; each competing league had its own broadcaster, both of which kept the rights to their respective conference after the merger, while additional networks were sold showcase packages of once-a-week games held at night.\n\nIn Canada, where the threat of competing sports leagues is far less, the CFL opts instead for an exclusive contract with [[The Sports Network|TSN]], available only by subscription to a cable or satellite service, to carry all of the league's games. The [[CFL on TSN]] exclusive contract began in 2008; previously, like the NFL, it split its broadcasts up between two providers.\n\nOther leagues have found it much more difficult to find an outlet on American television, much less one that pays a rights fee large enough to make it worthwhile. One of the reasons for the [[United Football League (2009)|United Football League]]'s failure was its having to pay for television coverage instead of being paid for the rights to it, along with its use of networks that were not widely available. Similarly, the [[Continental Football League]] only had one of its games televised nationally in its five-year existence, and the [[American Football Association (1978\u20131983)|American Football Association]] blamed its failure on an inability to secure television coverage.\n\nVirtually all professional football teams broadcast at least some of their games on local radio.\n\n==Rules==\nThe [[American football rules|rules of professional football]] are more likely to vary from league to league than the high school and college levels. Since interleague play is extremely rare, there is no need for a nationwide standard for all leagues, and each league will adopt and discard rules as they see fit. The [[Arena Football League]] had a patent on several of its rules that expired in 2007. Several professional leagues have experimented with rules in an effort to improve the quality of the game or to create a novelty. Nevertheless, the rules of professional football at the outdoor level are nearly identical to those at the high school and college levels, with some minor exceptions (such as the locations of [[hash marks]], procedures for [[overtime (sports)|overtime]], and the number of feet required to be in-bounds to catch a [[forward pass]]). Indoor football's rules are closely based on outdoor football but are heavily altered to compensate for the smaller field.\n\n==U.S. professional football history==\n\n===The first professional football player===\nProfessional football evolved from amateur \"club\" football, played by general interest [[sports club|athletic clubs or associations]]. These clubs began playing football in the 1880s, approximately ten years after the game took form in American colleges. Amateur club football established itself as a somewhat lower quality alternative to the more popular [[college football]]; some of the better teams would play against college teams. Eventually, some ostensibly amateur teams would secretly begin paying players a small sum to cover their expenses on an under-the-table basis, or arrange for amateur athletes to receive jobs in a company connected to the team (the [[Olympic Club]] of San Francisco, California is believed to have done the latter, thus creating the designation of \"[[semi-professional|semi-pro]]\" football in 1890, before football had gone professional); in most cases, the practice was within the rules of amateurism at the time. Many of the early semi-professional and professional teams were [[works team]]s consisting mostly of employees of the companies that sponsored them.\n\nThe first record of an American football player receiving \"pay for play\" came in 1892 with [[Pudge Heffelfinger's]] $500 contract to play in a game for the [[Allegheny Athletic Association]] against the Pittsburgh Athletic Club, with the second being [[Ben \"Sport\" Donnelly]]'s $250 contract to play for the same team the next week; the sums were very large by the standards of the day, and like most payment arrangements, both players denied any payment ever took place for much of their lives. For several years afterwards, individual players and sometimes entire teams received compensation to play in \"barnstorming\" type games without rigid schedules and against a variety of opponents. [[John Brallier]] became the first open professional after accepting $10 to play for the [[Latrobe Athletic Association]]; Latrobe became the first all-professional club soon after. [[William Chase Temple]] would become the first man to directly bankroll a football team himself when he assumed \"ownership\" of the [[Duquesne Country and Athletic Club]] in either 1898 or 1899. Throughout the 1890s, the [[Western Pennsylvania Professional Football Circuit]] would act as the ''de facto'' [[Major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada|major league]] (and, in fact, the ''only'' professional circuit) for football in the United States; it, like many of its successors, was not a \"league\" in the modern sense of a formalized organization, but rather an informal group of teams in free association with each other and any other team willing to play them.\n\nThe oldest existing professional football club is the [[Arizona Cardinals]], a current member of the National Football League. The Cardinals organization, which was originally based on Racine Street in Chicago, has operated near-continuously since 1913, but counts an earlier team that played from 1898 to 1906 as part of its history. The [[Watertown Red & Black]] is the oldest semi-professional club, tracing its history to 1896.\n\n===Early leagues: 1902\u20131919===\nWhile the practice of professional and semi-pro teams playing college and amateur teams was common in the 1890s, the [[Amateur Athletic Union]] began pressuring and threatening college teams with the loss of amateur status if they did so. Over the course of the first few years of the 20th Century, college and professional football began to diverge, until the [[NCAA]] formed in 1906, giving college football a separate sanctioning body. The stigma of being a professional athlete, and the threat it was to one's amateur status, meant that [[list of NFL nicknames|pseudonyms and nicknames]] were commonplace among professional players through the early part of the 20th century, in the hopes that covert professionals would not have themselves outed in a publicly released roster. Very few pro football players played under their given first names (John Brallier was a prominent exception). \n\nThe next step in pro football stemmed from an unusual source: baseball. Teams from each championship city (Pittsburgh and Philadelphia), three in all, received support from baseball teams in their cities and formed the [[National Football League (1902)|National Football League of 1902]], the first all-professional league. The league hoped to draw fans by featuring stars such as [[Rube Waddell]] and [[Christy Mathewson]] touring Pennsylvania and New York. It was during this time that [[Blondy Wallace]] emerged as the biggest, and most controversial, name in professional football. The league didn't draw as many fans as hoped, but promoter Tom O'Rourke considered the league to be the best teams in America. O'Rourke brought a coalition of the two Philadelphia teams to his [[World Series of Football (1902\u201303)|World Series of Football]] and immediately labeled them the favorite for the tournament, bestowing the team [[home advantage|home-field advantage]] and naming it [[New York (World Series of Football)|\"New York.\"]] New York was upset by the [[Syracuse Athletic Club]] in the first round.\n\nAn agreement between the baseball leagues to form modern [[Major League Baseball]] led directly to the end of the first NFL. From there, professional football's focus moved north and west, as teams such as the [[Massillon Tigers]] and the short-lived [[Franklin Athletic Club]] went on buying sprees in an effort to defeat local teams. Massillon's buying spree led to the rise of the [[Ohio League]], drawing much of the top professional football talent in America from Pennsylvania to Ohio, including Wallace, who signed with the [[Canton Bulldogs]]. Ohio pioneered the concept of playing games on Sundays to avoid competition with college football games; this was illegal in Pennsylvania (as well as New York City) due to still-existing [[blue law]]s, but eventually became the professional standard. A [[Canton Bulldogs-Massillon Tigers Betting Scandal|fabricated betting scandal]], coupled with a lack of competitive games and increasing price tags, effectively ruined the Ohio League by 1907. Professional football took a step back as the Ohio League relied more on local, cut-rate talent, such as player-promoter [[Peggy Parratt|George Parratt]], and its Pennsylvania counterpart also steered clear of major spending.\n\nAnother bidding war was sparked in 1915, when a revived Bulldogs signed multi-sport athletic superstar [[Jim Thorpe]] to a contract. During the late 1910s, the Ohio League not only had to compete among its own teams for talent, but also against leagues in Chicago and the [[New York Pro Football League]]. New York, with future NFL teams such as the [[Buffalo (NFL)|Buffalo Prospects]], [[Tonawanda Kardex]], and [[Rochester Jeffersons]], introduced the playoff tournament to professional football; Buffalo won the last contest in 1919. World War I and the [[1918 flu pandemic]] caused a severe disruption in professional football, which shut down most teams but allowed those that could continue (including most of the New York squads) to pick up the talent that stayed stateside, effectively ending the Ohio League's decade-long monopoly on pro football talent. [[Barnstorm (sports)|Barnstorming]] tours between the circuits, along with the continuing bidding wars, led to the regional circuits forming connections and laying the groundwork for the first truly national professional league.\n\n===American Professional Football Association: 1920\u20131921===\n\nA year after the Buffalo Prospects won the first Professional Football championship game, teams from the Ohio League organized to form the new American Professional Football Conference; two months later, adding teams from the other regional circuits surrounding Ohio, the league changed its name to the [[American Professional Football Association]] (APFA). In an effort to expand beyond the midwest, the league staged a showcase game between Canton and Buffalo at the [[Polo Grounds]] in New York City (Buffalo won) in December 1920. The league did not have a championship game or playoff, setting its championship with a vote of the league owners.  The [[Akron Pros]] had the best record in 1920, and the [[Chicago Staleys]] were the 1921 \"champions\", albeit [[1921 NFL Championship controversy|not without controversy]].\n\n===National Football League: 1922\u20131932===\n\nIn 1922, the APFA changed its name to the [[National Football League]]. While the Ohio League mostly ceased to exist after the foundation of the NFL (other than a few independent teams such as the [[Ironton Tanks]] and the pre-NFL [[Portsmouth Spartans]]), the other regional leagues continued. The New York league continued throughout the 1920s, outlasting many of the teams that it had contributed to the NFL, albeit without championships. Western Pennsylvania's league lasted until 1940. 1924 saw the foundation of eastern Pennsylvania's [[Anthracite League]], the last regional \"major league.\" The Anthracite League was won by the [[Pottsville Maroons]], who, after one year (and winning the league title), jumped to the NFL. The Anthracite League remanifested itself as the [[Eastern League of Professional Football]], an explicitly minor league, in 1926 and 1927.\n\nFrom 1922 through 1932, the NFL still declared as champions the team with the best record.  There were no set schedules, and each team did not play the same number of games: some teams played against college or other amateur teams.  The confusion reached a peak in 1925, when the aforementioned Maroons were hailed as the NFL champions by several newspapers after Pottsville defeated the Chicago Cardinals on December 6, even though there were still two weeks left in the season. This led to other teams scrambling to add extra games, including the [[Chicago Cardinals]], who won two 'extra' games and claimed the championship.  In the melee, the league cancelled games and suspended Pottsville's franchise. Through the 1920s, the smaller cities gave up on top-level pro football, while larger cities such as Boston, New York and Philadelphia saw teams take root there. This portion of the NFL's existence saw the admission of the [[Boston Braves (NFL)|Boston Braves]], owned by [[George Preston Marshall]] who was to exert major positive and negative influences on the league.\n\n===First American Football League: 1926===\n\nIn 1926, teams from nine cities ranging from the [[New York Yankees (1926 AFL)|New York Yankees]] to the [[Chicago Bulls (AFL, 1926)|Chicago Bulls]] to the [[Los Angeles Wildcats (AFL)|Los Angeles Wildcats]] (actually based in Chicago) formed the first [[American Football League (1926)|American Football League]] in competition with the NFL. Because of the 1925 shenanigans, the NFL's [[Rock Island Independents]] left the seven-year-old league to join the AFL.  The major attraction of the new league was [[Red Grange]] of the Yankees, but the league folded after just one year, with the Yankees being absorbed into the NFL.\n\n===National Football League: 1933\u20131945===\nIn 1933, the league divided into the Eastern and Western divisions, and finally instituted a championship game between the division winners.  Each team played from 10 to 13 games per season during this period, and by 1945, the league had two five-team divisions, with each team playing a 10-game regular season schedule.  In 1936, to select and assign graduating college players to particular Pro teams, the first Professional Football '[[NFL Draft|entry draft]]' was held.  The [[University of Chicago]]'s [[Heisman Trophy]]-winning running back [[Jay Berwanger]] was selected first overall by the [[Philadelphia Eagles]].  However, Berwanger chose not to play Professional Football.  The league was dominated by the [[Chicago Bears]], [[Green Bay Packers]], and [[New York Giants]], with stars like quarterback [[Sid Luckman]] (Bears); and fullbacks [[Tuffy Leemans]] (Giants) and [[Clarke Hinkle]] (Packers). Even with the stellar fullback [[Cliff Battles]], Marshall's team, now called the Redskins, was driven out of Boston in 1936 by a competing league, and he moved his franchise to Washington, D.C. as the [[Washington Redskins]].  Marshall introduced the marching band and a team song to Professional Football, along with other promotional efforts. However, he also refused to have black players on his team, and his influence resulted in the entire NFL excluding blacks after 1934. Also joining the NFL around this time was one of the last teams from Pennsylvania's independent era, the [[J.P. Rooneys|Rooneys]]; they became the Pittsburgh Pirates when they joined the NFL in 1933, later renaming themselves the [[Pittsburgh Steelers|Steelers]] as part of [[Pennsylvania Keystoners|a complicated franchise swap and abortive merger attempt]] in 1940.\n\nIn 1939, [[NBC]] broadcast the first-ever televised Professional Football game from [[Ebbets Field]], an October 22 contest between the [[Brooklyn Dodgers (NFL)|Brooklyn Dodgers]] and the [[Philadelphia Eagles]].  There were two fixed monochrome iconoscope cameras and a single play-by-play commentator, [[Skip Walz]].\n\nAlthough the NFL as a whole continued to play through World War II, the schedule was reduced, rosters were seriously impacted, and the Steelers were forced to merge operations with other NFL teams in [[Steagles|1943]] and [[Card-Pitt|1944]], while the [[Cleveland Rams]] were forced to suspend operations in 1943.\n\n===Second American Football League: 1936\u20131937===\nIn 1936, a second [[American Football League (1936)|American Football League]] of six teams was formed to challenge the NFL.  It included another [[New York Yankees (1936)|New York Yankees]] team, as well as the Cleveland Rams, the predecessor to today's [[Los Angeles Rams]].  Future [[American Football League]] (1960\u20131969) coach and Hall of Famer [[Sid Gillman]] played his only year of Professional Football with the Rams.  Before this AFL's second year, the Rams jumped to the NFL and were replaced by the first Professional Football team to actually play its home games on the West Coast, the [[Los Angeles Bulldogs]], who had several stars including quarterback [[Harry Newman]] and end [[Bill Moore (American football)|Bill Moore]]. The [[Boston Shamrocks (AFL)|Boston Shamrocks]], with all-star end [[Bill Fleming (American football)|Bill Fleming]], outdrew the NFL's Redskins in 1936, causing George Preston Marshall to move the team to Washington.  However, the league as a whole could not compete, and folded after the 1937 season.\n\nAlso in 1936, the [[American Association (football)|American Association]] was founded as a minor league. It played for five seasons, suspending operations for World War II, and returned under the \"American Football League\" name in 1946 before sputtering to a collapse in 1950.\n\n===Third American Football League: 1940\u20131941===\nStill another try at an [[American Football League (1940)|American Football League]] was made in 1940, with five franchises, including a third [[New York Yankees (1940 AFL)|New York Yankees]] team.  The league was the first major Professional Football league to complete a double round robin schedule, in which each team played each other twice.  The onset of World War II and the resultant draft dried up the source of players for professional football and the new league did not have enough resources to continue.\n\nAlso forming in 1940 was the [[Pacific Coast Professional Football League]], the first professional league on the West Coast. The PCPFL was notable for its continuous operation through World War II (it even [[American Football League (1944)|spun off a second league in 1944]]) and for its open embrace of [[black players in American professional football|black talent]] that had been blacklisted from the NFL since the 1930s. Along with the American Association and the [[Dixie League (American football)|Dixie League]], the PCPFL were members of the [[Association of Professional Football Leagues]], the first [[minor league]] compact with the NFL. The PCPFL folded in 1948 after years of declining attendance and the arrival of the NFL in its flagship Los Angeles market.\n\n===All-America Football Conference: 1946\u20131949===\nA year after World War II, another new Professional Football league was formed \u2013 the [[All-America Football Conference]] (AAFC).  It attracted some of the nation's best football players and posed a serious challenge to the NFL.  Like the pre-war AFL, it used a double round robin schedule.  The league was dominated by a franchise owned and coached by [[Paul Brown]]: the [[Cleveland Browns]], a team that would win the league's championship every year of its existence. The Browns featured players such as fullback [[Marion Motley]], quarterback [[Otto Graham]] and kicker [[Lou Groza]], while the [[San Francisco 49ers]] had running back [[Elroy Hirsch|Elroy 'Crazylegs' Hirsch]] and the [[Baltimore Colts (1947\u201350)|Baltimore Colts]] (not related to today's [[Indianapolis Colts]], which began play in Baltimore in 1953) fielded quarterback [[Y. A. Tittle]].\n\nPaul Brown made many innovations to the game on and off the field, including year-round coaching staffs, precision pass patterns, face masks, and the use of \"messenger guards\". He was the first coach to film the opposition and break down those game films in a classroom setting, also attributed to him. While the NFL was still segregated, the AAFC's Browns became the first modern Professional Football team to sign black players.\n\nAlthough many of its teams outdrew NFL teams, by 1949 the AAFC's costs had risen so steeply that the league agreed to a 'merger' with the NFL.  It was more of a 'swallowing' of the AAFC, with only the Browns, 49ers, and Colts being admitted to the established league, even though the [[Buffalo Bills (AAFC)|Buffalo Bills]] drew good crowds and raised funds from citizens to back the franchise.  Players from the Bills and the other AAFC teams not 'merged' were distributed among the NFL teams.  Motley, Graham, Groza, Hirsch and Tittle all starred in the NFL after the 'merger'.\n\nOf the three AAFC teams that joined the NFL:\n* The Colts lasted only one year in the NFL; the [[History of the Indianapolis Colts|second Baltimore Colts]] were officially a new franchise launched in 1953, though tracing their history through a series of teams dating back to 1919, before the formation of the NFL.\n* The Browns remained in Cleveland until [[Cleveland Browns relocation controversy|their controversial move]] to Baltimore, becoming the [[Baltimore Ravens]], for the [[1996 NFL season|1996 season]]. The controversy was ultimately settled by granting Cleveland a new franchise, which began play in [[1999 NFL season|1999]], that took the Browns name and official lineage.\n* The 49ers have remained in the NFL and San Francisco since their admission to the league. They moved within the [[San Francisco Bay Area|Bay Area]] media market to [[Santa Clara Stadium|a new stadium]] in the [[Silicon Valley]] community of [[Santa Clara, California|Santa Clara]] in 2014.\n\n===National Football League: 1946\u20131959===\n\nFollowing five years of what the league perceived to be weak leadership on behalf of commissioner [[Elmer Layden]] (of [[Four Horsemen of Notre Dame|Four Horsemen]] fame), league officials appointed Philadelphia Eagles owner-founder [[Bert Bell]] as commissioner in 1946.\n\nAfter twelve years without black players in the NFL, the [[Los Angeles Rams]] added them in 1946, as they were required by their stadium lease to integrate the team. The league had two five-team divisions, each team playing an unwieldy 11-game schedule, with some teams playing more home games than others.  They increased to twelve games the following year, partly because of the success of the rival AAFC's 14-game format.  After the AAFC folded, the NFL added three of its teams, for a total of thirteen, but maintained the 14-game format.  The first year after admitting the [[Cleveland Browns]], the NFL was humbled by having the Browns, a team from what it had ridiculed as an inferior league, win its championship.  The Browns went on to be NFL champions in three of their first six years in the league. In 1958, the [[History of the Indianapolis Colts|Baltimore Colts]] defeated the [[New York Giants]] 23\u201317 in professional football's first sudden-death championship game,{{Clarify|date=December 2009}} and repeated the victory against the same team in the 1959 NFL title game, this time by a score of 31\u201316.  The Colts had folded after the 1950 season and from 1951 through 1959 the NFL had twelve teams, six each in the East and West conferences. The league during this period featured not only star players absorbed from the AAFC 'merger' but others such as halfback [[Frank Gifford]] ([[New York Giants]]); the [[Philadelphia Eagles]]' quarterback [[Norm Van Brocklin]] and receiver [[Tommy McDonald (American football)|Tommy McDonald]]; and the Colts' quarterback [[Johnny Unitas]] and running back [[Lenny Moore]].  Television coverage of the league was spotty, with some teams starting in 1950 to have individual arrangements with the [[NFL on DuMont|Dumont Network]] and NBC.  CBS began to televise selected NFL regular season games in 1956, but there was no league-wide, national television (the Browns, for instance, held out and syndicated games themselves until the early 1960s when a league-wide contract was imposed).\n\n===Fourth American Football League: 1960\u20131969===\nBy the start of the 1960s, the NFL was complacent in its dominance of the market for Professional Football fans, and had little incentive to expand that market.  The AAFC was history, and the NFL had chosen not to capitalize on the boost it had received from the 1958 Colts-Giants sudden-death game.  It was content with a 12-team league playing a 12-game schedule and featured \"ball-control\" football.  When Texas oilmen [[Lamar Hunt]] and [[Bud Adams]] tried to purchase existing NFL franchises to move to Texas, or to establish new NFL franchises there, they were told that the conservative NFL was not interested.  The result was that Hunt and Adams joined with six other businessmen to form the fourth [[American Football League]] (1960\u20131969).  The league started out by signing half of the NFL's 1960 first-round draft choices including the [[Houston Oilers]]' [[Billy Cannon]], and never slowed down.  With future Hall of Fame Coaches [[Hank Stram]] ([[Kansas City Chiefs|Dallas Texans/Kansas City Chiefs]]) and [[Sid Gillman]] ([[San Diego Chargers|LA/San Diego Chargers]]) as well as others like the [[Buffalo Bills]]' [[Lou Saban]], the league offered a more risk-oriented on-field approach that appealed to fans.  The AFL also actively recruited from [[historically black colleges and universities|predominantly black colleges]] and other small colleges, a source the NFL virtually ignored.  This led to a higher percentage of minority players, as well as several firsts, such as the first black number one draft choice ([[Buck Buchanan]], Chiefs); the first black [[middle linebacker]], [[Willie Lanier]], Chiefs; and the first modern black starting quarterback ([[Marlin Briscoe]], Broncos).\n\nThe AFL was similar to the AAFC in that it offered innovations, like a return to the double round robin schedule introduced by the earlier league and had eight teams in two divisions like the AAFC.  The AFL also introduced official scoreboard clocks, player names on jerseys, the two-point PAT conversion and important off-the field elements such as gate and TV revenue-sharing and national TV contracts.  The AFL developed the first ever cooperative television plan for professional football, in which the proceeds of the contract were divided equally among member clubs. ABC and the AFL also introduced moving, on-field cameras (as opposed to the fixed midfield cameras of CBS and the NFL), and were the first to have players \"miked\" during broadcast games.\n\nBut the American Football League was different from the AAFC in its overall competitive balance.  While the Browns-dominated AAFC had had the same champion every year, six out of the [[Foolish Club|Original Eight]] AFL teams won at least one AFL championship, and all but one (the lone exception being the [[Denver Broncos]]) played in at least one post-season game.  In addition to traditional eastern cities, it placed teams in Texas, in the West with the Broncos, [[Oakland Raiders]] and the Chargers, and eventually in the Midwest [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]] and the deep South [[Miami]].  The league forced a merger with its rival, and made possible the [[Super Bowl]] at the end of the 1966 season. Although it lost the first two, by its demise it had beaten two NFL teams proclaimed as \"the best in history\" to win the final two World Championship games between two Professional Football league champions.  The decade ended with the AFL retaining its original franchises, plus two expansion teams, and those ten teams represented the first time a major sports league had merged with another without losing a franchise.\n\nThe legacy of the American Football League is that virtually every aspect of today's wildly popular professional football, on and off the field, can be traced to innovations developed by the AFL and adopted by the NFL.\n\n===National Football League: 1960\u20131969===\nAfter the sudden death of commissioner [[Bert Bell]] in 1959, [[Los Angeles Rams]] general manager [[Pete Rozelle]] was named his replacement after a contentious, eight-day, 23-ballot stalemated election in which the league's favored candidate, Marshall Leahy, repeatedly fell one vote short of the supermajority of votes necessary to be elected commissioner. Whereas his predecessors generally put their league offices in the city of the teams they previously represented (the key issue that prevented Leahy from becoming Commissioner, as he was previously an employee of the [[San Francisco 49ers]] and was planning to move league offices to the West Coast), Rozelle instead agreed to establish a permanent office in New York City, where the league remains to this day.\n\nThe 1960 NFL had ten teams, only two south of Washington, D.C. and/or west of Chicago (the Los Angeles Rams and San Francisco 49ers), and none in the [[Southern United States]], where college football still dominated.  Though it had rebuffed efforts to move or expand, it immediately was put on the defensive by the new AFL, first causing the owners of the proposed Minnesota franchise in that league to renege for an NFL franchise to start in 1961, and immediately establishing the Cowboys in previously rejected Dallas, as competition to Hunt's [[Dallas Texans (AFL)|Dallas Texans]]. The NFL also expanded its footprint by moving the [[Chicago Cardinals (NFL, 1920\u201359)|Chicago Cardinals]] to St. Louis, Missouri in 1960. Later, it impeded the AFL's planned expansion to Atlanta by offering that city's investor the [[Atlanta Falcons|Falcons]]' NFL franchise.  Ironically, the Falcons' replacement in the AFL were the [[Miami Dolphins]] who have appeared in five Super Bowls, winning two, while the Falcons were losers in their one appearance.  Star NFL players during this period included the Browns' fullback [[Jim Brown]]; the [[Green Bay Packers]]' quarterback [[Bart Starr]], fullback [[Jim Taylor (fullback)|Jim Taylor]] and halfback [[Paul Hornung]]; halfback [[Gale Sayers]] of the [[Chicago Bears]]; Cowboys receiver [[Bob Hayes]]; the [[Philadelphia Eagles]]' and the Redskins' [[Charley Taylor]].  The AFL's influence on the NFL was evident in several ways: in 1962, the NFL emulated the junior league by arranging its own league-wide national television contract, with CBS; and late in the 'sixties, the NFL began recognizing the wide talent pool the AFL had tapped in [[Historically Black colleges and universities|small and predominantly black colleges]], and it, too, started scouting and signing from those schools.\n\nTired of raids on players and escalating salaries, in the mid-1960s, certain NFL owners secretly approached AFL principals, seeking a merger of the two leagues.  The merger was agreed to in 1966, with a championship game to be played between the league titlists, and a merged schedule beginning with the 1970 season, when existing TV contracts could be re-worked.\nThe decade was dominated in the NFL by the Packers, who won four NFL titles, and by the mid-to late 1960s their head coach [[Vince Lombardi]] had fashioned a team that, with its ball-control style, would overpower the NFL and carry on to defeat AFL opponents in the first two AFL-NFL Championship Games after the 1966 and 1967 Professional Football seasons. The NFL champions in 1968, the Colts, and in 1969 the [[Minnesota Vikings]], were each in turn considered to be \"the best team in the history of the NFL.\"  By 1969, the NFL had grown to 16 teams, with four teams directly attributable to the existence of the AFL: the Vikings, Cowboys, and Falcons, added to compete with the AFL, and the [[New Orleans Saints]], who were added as a reward to Louisiana federal legislators for their support of PL 89-800, which permitted the merger. Likewise, the AFL-NFL wars brought two teams to Missouri (one in each league), marking the first time NFL teams had played in the state since the 1930s.\n\n===Minor Leagues: 1961\u20131973===\n\nConcurrently with the AFL and NFL rivalry, several minor leagues thrived in this era as well. The [[United Football League (1961)|United Football League]] lasted from 1961 to 1964 and was concentrated in the midwest. However, in 1962 it was quickly eclipsed by the [[Atlantic Coast Football League]], which was run by the same people (the Rosentover family) as the previous American Association of the 1930s. When the UFL folded, and the Newark Bears of the ACFL unsuccessfully applied to join the AFL, two new leagues formed: the [[Professional Football League of America]] (PFLA), which ran from 1965 to 1967, and the more prominent [[Continental Football League]] (ContFL), which ran from 1965 to 1969. The ACFL lost three of its best teams to the ContFL, but survived. The ContFL and ACFL had different strategies: the ContFL had major-league aspirations, while the ACFL was happy as a developmental league and (like previous leagues run by the Rosentovers) allowed its teams to become farm teams to the AFL and NFL teams (for instance, the [[Hartford Knights]] were a farm team to the AFL's [[Buffalo Bills]]). The ContFL arguably had better talent that went on to NFL and CFL stardom ([[Ken Stabler]], [[Don Jonas]], [[Johnnie Walton]] and [[Sam Wyche]]), but folded after 1969, and plans to take on the CFL head-to-head were abandoned. The ACFL also produced some significant talent (e.g. [[Marvin Hubbard]], [[King Corcoran|Jim Corcoran]] and the first female professional football player, placeholder [[Patricia Palinkas]]) and lasted longer, through 1971, with a return season in 1973. The attempted major [[World Football League]] sapped the ACFL of most of its talent, and forced it to fold prior to the 1974 season.\n\n===National Football League: 1970\u20131975===\nIn 1970, the NFL realigned into two conferences, with the Browns, Steelers and Colts joining the ten former American Football League teams in the [[American Football Conference]] and the remaining NFL teams forming the [[National Football Conference]]. The AFL's official scoreboard clock and jersey-back player names were adopted by the merged league, but the [[two-point conversion]] was not adopted until [[1994 NFL season|1994]].\n\nThe AFL\u2013NFL merger also led to the creation of a weekly showcase game: ''[[Monday Night Football]]''. Originally broadcast on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] beginning with the 1970 season, it moved to [[ESPN]] in 2006.\n\nAll of the American Football League records and statistics were accepted by the merged league as equivalent to pre-merger NFL records and statistics.  Thus, a yard gained in the AFL in 1960 is as valid as a yard gained in the NFL in 1960. [[American Football League All-Star games|AFL All-Star Game]] selections and appearances are equivalent to NFL 'Pro Bowl' choices.  They are equivalent, but, however, not identical, and this has caused errors in reporting by some sources.  For example, [[John Hadl]] is listed in most on-line records as having been selected for the 1970 Pro Bowl, played after the 1969 professional football season.  However, in 1970, there were both an NFL Pro Bowl and an AFL All-Star Game, the AFL event being the final event ever staged under the auspices of the American Football League.  Hadl, of the [[San Diego Chargers]] was MVP of the January 1970 AFL All-Star Game.  The January 1970 NFL Pro Bowl was a different game, featuring only NFL players. Similar errors are made when players like the [[Oakland Raiders]]' [[Jim Otto]] are cited as having \"fifteen years of NFL experience.\"  In fact, Otto had ten years of AFL experience and five years of NFL experience, or fifteen years of ''Professional Football'' experience.\n\nIn 1974, the rival [[World Football League]] successfully lured several NFL stars to its upstart league, but collapsed midway through the 1975 season due to financial problems. The [[Memphis Southmen]] made an unsuccessful bid to join the NFL, even going as far as taking deposits for season tickets and going to court to file a lawsuit to attempt to force this, and the [[Birmingham Vulcans]] collected petition signatures to attempt to show a similar high level of support, but never got as far as Memphis. Neither city has ever gotten an NFL franchise (though the [[Tennessee Titans|Tennessee Oilers]] did later play [[1998 Tennessee Oilers season|one season in Memphis]]).\n\nAlso in [[1974 NFL season|1974]], the NFL, after over four decades of having its goal posts on the goal line (as Canadian football still does), finally moved its goalposts back to the end line, as is the norm in high school and college football in the United States, in an effort to decrease the number of field goal attempts, and moved the kickoff back to the 35-yard line.\n\n===National Football League: 1976\u20131994===\nIn 1976, the NFL added the [[Seattle Seahawks]] and the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] to the NFL. To accommodate the larger league, the schedule expanded from 14 games to its current length of 16 games in 1978. The playoff field was likewise expanded to ten teams, then again to twelve teams in 1990, where it has remained ever since.\n\nThe NFL began experiencing problems in the 1980s. Labor stoppages in 1982 (which led to the NFL season being cut in half) and 1987 (resulting in the league using replacement players for three games), combined with [[Al Davis]] winning a lawsuit to allow his team, the Raiders, to move from Oakland to Los Angeles against league wishes, forced NFL Commissioner [[Pete Rozelle]] into retirement. [[Paul Tagliabue]] was named his replacement.\n\nThe NFL backed the minor-league [[World League of American Football]], a league based in the U.S., Canada, and Europe, which ran for two seasons. After its suspension, two American teams jumped to the Canadian Football League, though only one (the [[Sacramento Gold Miners|Sacramento franchise]]) would play in that league.\n\n===United States Football League: 1983\u20131985===\nThe [[United States Football League]] was the most significant challenger to the NFL since the American Football League, and the last of any significance to date. The USFL's gimmick was to avoid direct head-to-head competition with the NFL and college ball, and play in the spring. Originally intended as a minor league, this ended when several deep pocketed owners began luring top talent such as [[Herschel Walker]] to the USFL with high salaries.\n\nThe groundwork for what eventually led to the demise of the USFL was set mainly by [[Donald Trump]], owner of the [[New Jersey Generals]] and a vocal opponent of the league's spring football concept, who led a coalition that sought to take the NFL on head-to-head with a fall schedule and later force a merger. This was a major problem for several teams, who were ill-prepared to face the NFL juggernaut, and fans quickly walked away from these lame-duck franchises when it became clear the USFL was done with spring football. The USFL pinned its hopes on an anti-trust lawsuit against the NFL; though the USFL won the case, it was a [[Pyrrhic victory]], as the jury only awarded damages of US$3.\n\nThe USFL's biggest legacy was the fact that it helped develop some of the best quarterbacks in professional football during the 1990s. Many members of the prolific draft classes of 1983 through 1985 played in the USFL and went on to have strong careers in the NFL and CFL, including [[Steve Young (American football)|Steve Young]], [[Jim Kelly]], [[Doug Williams (American football)|Doug Williams]] (who was actually drafted several years earlier, in 1978), [[Bobby Hebert]] and [[Doug Flutie]].\n\n===Arena Football League: 1987\u20132019===\n\nImmediately after the USFL suspended operations in 1986, USFL executive [[Jim Foster (arena football)|James F. \"Jim\" Foster]] began work on a brand new variant of football. Known as \"[[arena football]]\", the sport was played on a much shorter 50-yard field and was built heavily on a high-scoring offensive game. After two test games, he launched a professional league, the [[Arena Football League]], in 1987. The AFL began its 24th season in 2011, and is currently the United States' second longest running professional football league ever, after the NFL. The AFL also had a minor league, [[AF2]], which ran for 10 seasons, from 2000 to 2009. The current version of the Arena Football League is technically the second league to bear that name; the first collapsed under the weight of bankruptcy after the 2008 season, then was bought by a coalition of its teams and relaunched in 2010 in its current incarnation. From a high of 18 teams in 2011, the second Arena Football League steadily shrunk until bottoming out at four teams in 2018. The league folded a second time after its 2019 season.\n\nThe success of arena football led to a revival of interest in [[indoor American football|indoor football]], particularly after the AFL lost a lawsuit over the extent of its patents in 1998. As of 2020, all of the leagues who play the indoor game play regionally, either in the midwest ([[Indoor Football League]] and [[Champions Indoor Football]]), southeast ([[National Arena League]] and [[American Arena League]]) or northwest ([[America West Football Conference]]). One unusual variant of indoor football was the [[Legends Football League|Lingerie Football League]], in which scantily clad women play the game by a modified variant of indoor rules; that league was at least semi-professional for its first two years, but since 2011, it (along with its successor league, the Legends Football League) has played at an amateur level.\n\n===National Football League: 1995\u20132001===\nThe USFL's impact was not limited to players, however. The USFL apparently established Oakland, Baltimore, Jacksonville and Arizona as viable markets for professional football. As such, the St. Louis Cardinals moved to Phoenix, Arizona to become the [[Arizona Cardinals]] in 1988, while the Houston Oilers very nearly moved to Jacksonville in 1987 before deciding to stay, for the short term, in Houston.\n\nIn 1993, the NFL began exploring expansion, eyeing five proposals ([[Baltimore Bombers (proposed NFL team)|Baltimore]], [[St. Louis Stallions|St. Louis]], [[Memphis Hound Dogs|Memphis]], Charlotte and Jacksonville), all of which were in cities that had hosted professional football before. The \"Carolina Cougars\" (later renamed [[Carolina Panthers]]) and [[Jacksonville Jaguars]] received franchises to begin play in 1995. At the same time, Al Davis moved the Raiders back to its original home in Oakland for the 1995 season, while at the same time, the Rams, who had suffered in attendance since the Raiders' arrival, relocated to St. Louis; the concurrent departures of both teams from southern California began a 21-year stretch in which [[History of the National Football League in Los Angeles|the league had no teams in Los Angeles]].\n\nIt was not until after the 1995 season, after Baltimore's CFL team won the Grey Cup, that Baltimore got a second look, this time from Art Modell, who took the core of his Cleveland Browns team to Baltimore to found the expansion [[Baltimore Ravens]]. The effort effectively killed the CFL's American expansion. The Browns returned, restocked with new players and with new ownership, in 1999. Meanwhile, the Oilers left Houston for Tennessee after the 1996 season; initially beginning what was planned to be a two-year stint in Memphis, disastrous attendance levels prompted the team to cut that experiment short after a single year and move to its permanent home in Nashville in 1998, eventually rebranding as the [[Tennessee Titans]].\n\nAlso borrowed from the USFL was the [[two-point conversion]], which the NFL adopted in 1994, and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers' color scheme, which was loosely based on that of the [[Tampa Bay Bandits]].\n\nThe NFL revived the World League in 1995, this time headquartered solely in Europe, eventually changing the name of the league to the NFL Europe League (known as either [[NFL Europe]] or, in its last season, as NFL Europa, to avoid [[RAS syndrome]]). Originally having its teams spread across several countries including Spain, England, Scotland, the Netherlands and Germany, by the end of the league's run in 2007, only the Netherlands and Germany (the latter of which had five of the league's six teams) were still in the league.\n\nStrained relations between the NFL and its players' union quieted down significantly in the 1990s, and the development of [[free agency]] as well as a [[salary cap]] led to peaceful relations between the two entities for over a decade. This was helped by new [[NFL on television|television contracts]]: in 1994, [[Fox Broadcasting Company]] set the tone for broadcast rights to the NFL when it outbid CBS for the right to air NFC games with an unheard-of bid of US$395,000,000. This brought total broadcast rights fees for the league to over US$1,000,000,000. In 1998, when CBS outbid NBC for the rights to the AFC, the total rights fees doubled to over US$2,000,000,000. This is in addition to the rights fee for [[NFL Sunday Ticket]], a package offered exclusively to the [[DirecTV]] satellite television service, that began in the mid-1990s.\n\nSeveral short-lived professional leagues arose in the wake of the [[dot-com boom]] in the late 1990s. The [[Regional Football League]] played one season in 1999, and the [[Spring Football League]] played only two weeks in 2000. The short-lived, highly publicized and widely derided [[XFL (2001)|XFL]] played one season in the winter of 2001.\n\n===National Football League: 2002\u2013present===\nThe [[Houston Texans]] were added to the league in 2002 to replace the Oilers, bringing the league to an even 32 teams. [[Roger Goodell]] took over as commissioner from the retiring Paul Tagliabue in 2006.\n\nAlso during this era, the league began expanding its influence overseas. [[F\u00fatbol Americano]], a one-off game in Mexico City, was the first regular-season game held outside the United States in 2005; it was followed by the [[NFL International Series]], an annual game held in London in the last week of October since 2007. In an unrelated move, the [[Buffalo Bills]] began their [[Bills Toronto Series]], playing an annual December game in Canada, in 2008. The Toronto series will run through 2012.\n\nIn 2003, the NFL launched its own in-house network, [[NFL Network]]. Beginning in 2006, at the end of the previous broadcast contract, the NFL launched an [[Thursday Night Football|eight-game late-season package]] specifically for the network. The 2006 television contract expanded total annual broadcast rights to over US$3,000,000,000, and the 2011 renewal of those rights pushed the annual total to nearly US$5,000,000,000. Between 2006 and 2022, the networks will have paid the NFL nearly US$70,000,000,000\u2014a total greater than the resale value of all thirty-two NFL teams combined.\n\nThe labor peace in the NFL came to a halt in 2010, when a group of NFL owners invoked an out clause in the league's collective bargaining agreement with the players' union, subsequently imposing a lockout in 2011. The players' association responded by disbanding and having its players sue the league for antitrust violations. The two sides came to an agreement in late July 2011, after one preseason game, that year's [[Pro Football Hall of Fame Game]], was lost due to the lockout. The current collective bargaining agreement, which has no opt-outs, lasts through 2021.\n\n===Alternate leagues: 2009\u20132015, 2019\u2013future===\nThe [[United Football League (2009)|United Football League]] began play in 2009 with an abbreviated \"Premiere Season\" that featured four teams, two on each coast, in a six-week schedule. The UFL, which mostly featured former NFL players, marked the first professional fall league other than the [[National Football League]] to play in the United States since the [[World Football League]] in the mid-1970s.  All UFL games aired on [[Versus (TV channel)|Versus]] and [[HDnet]]; every game was also [[webcast]]. The league returned in 2010 with a new expansion team in Omaha, Nebraska and an eight-game, ten-week schedule. From there, however, the UFL collapsed, cutting both its 2011 and 2012 seasons short after four weeks of play and failing to pay most of its bills in a timely manner.\n\nThe [[Stars Football League]] began play as a four-team league on June 30, 2011, with an eight-week schedule, and played three abbreviated seasons. The [[Fall Experimental Football League]], an explicitly minor league operating on a sort of \"extended [[National Football League preseason|preseason]]\" approach, played two seasons before being replaced with [[The Spring League]], which is non-professional. Numerous other professional leagues attempted to launch in the late 2000s and early 2010s but never materialized, including the [[All American Football League]], the [[United National Gridiron League]] and [[A-11 Football League]].\n\nIn 2018, the two leading figures behind the original XFL announced their re-entry into the professional football market with rival leagues: former NBC head [[Dick Ebersol]] attached to the [[Alliance of American Football]] to begin play in 2019; it collapsed amid financial shortfalls and disputes partway through its lone season. [[Vince McMahon]] reacquired the XFL intellectual property rights and launched a [[XFL (2020)|second version of the XFL]] in 2020 to somewhat greater success and reception.\n\n==Canadian professional football history==\n{{See also|History of Canadian football|professional football in Canada}}\nCanadian football had similar origins to its American counterparts. Several Canadian professional teams are older than the oldest existing American teams, because they began as amateur rugby organizations. The Canadian game evolved parallel to the American game, but several years behind: the [[Burnside Rules]] were adopted in 1905, and the [[forward pass]] (in place on the American side of the border since 1906) was adopted in 1929 after significant pressure from American coaches. The touchdown remained worth five points until 1956 (it changed mainly due to Canadian pro football holding an American TV contract), whereas it had increased to six points in 1912 in the United States. Several relics of the old rules of the game, including goal posts on the goal line, a 110-yard field, more liberal rules for use of the [[drop kick]], and only three downs, remain in the Canadian game.\n\nCanadian football was, prior to the 1950s, dominated by three amateur organizations: the [[Ontario Rugby Football Union]] (ORFU), the [[Interprovincial Rugby Football Union]] (IRFU, or \"Big Four\"), and the [[Western Interprovincial Football Union]] (WIFU). By 1954, the IRFU and WIFU had gone professional (in part thanks to an American television contract from NBC that paid the Big Four more than the one DuMont was offering the NFL), and in that year the ORFU dropped out of competition for the decades-old [[Grey Cup]], the championship of Canadian football. This is generally recognized as the moment that began the modern era of Canadian professional football. The WIFU and IRFU incrementally merged into one league over the next several years: the two created the Canadian Football Council in 1956, jointly separated from the Canadian Rugby Union (Canada's governing body for football, now known as [[Football Canada]]) in 1958, and began inter-union play in 1961. The CFL currently recognizes the [[1958 CFL season|1958 season]], its first separate from Football Canada, as its starting point. (The ORFU eventually faded out of existence in the 1970s.)\n\nThe CFL has been, at various times in its history, competitive with the NFL in terms of being able to acquire talent, though the league's self-imposed rule changes have hampered that in recent years (for instance, the marquee player exemption to the salary cap that once allowed CFL teams to sign one top-level player is no longer there, and the league has banned signing suspended NFL players). It has not been competitive on a team level with the NFL, as evidenced by the fact that in a series of interleague matchups between the IRFU and the NFL in the 1950s and 1960s, the NFL won all six matches. (The Hamilton Tiger-Cats, the best team in the IRFU at the time, ''did'' win one game against an American pro team in 1961, but it was an American Football League team, not an NFL team.)\n\nThe league attempted an [[CFL USA|American expansion]] in 1993. Initially starting with the [[Sacramento Gold Miners]] (who jumped more or less intact from the WLAF and would become the [[San Antonio Texans]] in 1995), by 1995 the CFL had five U.S. teams, mostly based in the southern and western United States. The league itself was suffering from financial problems at the time, and the general suspicion was that the addition of American teams was mainly a gambit to net expansion revenue for the eight remaining Canadian franchises. The league did lure credible and stable owners for most of the American teams (a contrast from other efforts at U.S. pro football outside the NFL), but lack of respect from the established Canadian teams, poor attendance in most markets, a handful of particularly problematic owners on both the American and Canadian sides of the border, and an inability to secure a television contract because of the league's avoidance of major U.S. markets all led to tens of millions of dollars in financial losses and the end of the American experiment after the 1995 season.\n\nThe two teams based in [[Ottawa]] and [[Montr\u00e9al]] have been in flux for the past three decades. The original Alouettes folded in 1982; a [[Montreal Concordes]] team was founded the same year to replace them, but the Concordes (which renamed themselves the Alouettes in 1986) folded prior to 1987. The current Alouettes arrived in Montr\u00e9al in 1996, absorbing the two previous Montr\u00e9al teams'  histories but disowning that of the team that formed its basis, the [[Baltimore Stallions]]; the Stallions were the only American team to be both an on-field and off-field success and are the only U.S.-based team to ever win the Grey Cup. The Alouettes' situation was largely stable for the first two decades after relaunch before a sudden collapse in the team's finances forced its owner to return the franchise to the league in 2019. The [[Ottawa Rough Riders]] folded in 1996; the [[Ottawa Renegades]] were named as Ottawa's next CFL team from 2002 to 2005, but that team also folded. In both the Rough Riders and Renegades cases, the team failures came during, or shortly after, [[Bernard Glieberman]] had purchased the respective team. In 2014, the new [[Ottawa Redblacks]] (owned by [[Jeff Hunt]]) began play at a drastically refurbished [[Frank Clair Stadium]], thus becoming the third Ottawa CFL team and returning the league back to the traditional nine teams. Although Hunt owns the rights to the former [[Ottawa Rough Riders|Rough Riders]] intellectual property and based the Redblacks' logo and colors on those of the Rough Riders, he chose the name RedBlacks in June 2013, mainly to avoid a trademark dispute with the similarly named [[Saskatchewan Roughriders]]. The revived Ottawa franchise has also been a success.\n\nIn the long term, the CFL has shown significantly more stability than the American leagues. The league has, for all but three years of its history, had either eight or nine teams, all based in the same nine markets. The league has resisted expanding beyond its current nine teams and has, to date, never moved a Canadian team from one city to another. One particular market that has been a persistent topic of discussion has been the [[maritime provinces]]. The CFL approved an Atlantic franchise for [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax]] known as the [[Atlantic Schooners]] in 1984 provided a stadium with sufficient capacity was built by then; however, no such stadium was ever built (the only outdoor stadium in Halifax, [[Huskies Stadium]], only seated less than half of what CFL rules mandate and has since been demolished). The [[Touchdown Atlantic]] series is a series of one-off games that are played in Atlantic region stadiums; the first, a preseason game, was held at Huskies Stadium in 2003. A follow-up game was scheduled for the same venue for 2006, but was canceled due to the Ottawa Renegades (who were to play in the game) folding. The series was revived as a regular season game in 2010, but instead at [[New Moncton Stadium]] in [[Moncton]], which is much closer to the CFL's capacity guidelines; three games were played in the regular season series, with a fourth slated for 2019 as [[Schooners Sports and Entertainment|another Atlantic Schooners proposal]] is seeking to join the league.\n\nCanada has historically been sheltered from the rival leagues that the NFL faced for most of its first century of existence. [[John F. Bassett]], a Canadian multimedia heir, was at the center of two attempts to bring the rival leagues to Canada, first with the [[Toronto Northmen]] in the WFL, then with a USFL team in [[Hamilton, Ontario]]. In both cases, Canadian Parliament threatened to pass the [[Canadian Football Act]], a proposed law that would have codified the CFL's monopoly on football and outlawed any other professional league from playing in the dominion. (In each case, Bassett instead backed a U.S.-based team, the [[Memphis Southmen]] and [[Tampa Bay Bandits]], respectively). The Act was never passed or made law.\n\nProfessional football has yet to be played in two provinces: [[Prince Edward Island]] (which is likely too small to accommodate any professional game) and [[Newfoundland and Labrador]].\n\n==Further reading==\n*[[Harry March|March, Harry]].

In common usage, it refers to former and existing major football leagues in either country.  Currently, there are multiple professional football leagues in North America: the three best known are the [[National Football League]] (NFL) and the [[Arena Football League]] (AFL) in the U.S. and the [[Canadian Football League]] (CFL) in Canada.  The NFL has existed continuously since being so named in 1922.\n\n==Organization==\nCompared to the other [[major professional sports leagues of the United States and Canada]], football has comparatively few levels of play and does not have a well-developed [[minor league]] system or [[League system|pyramid]], either official or otherwise.\n\nIn North America, the top level of professional football is the [[National Football League]], with the [[Canadian Football League]] second to the NFL in prominence and pay grade. Despite the lower level of pay, the CFL has greater popularity in Canada because of its long history in the country, the NFL's limited presence in Canada, and a general environment of [[Canadian cultural protectionism]].\n\n[[Indoor American football|Indoor football]] has also developed in the United States, beginning with the [[Arena Football League]], which formed in 1987. The AFL is the second longest running professional football league in the United States after the NFL, although its current incarnation is a separate entity from the original, which folded due to bankruptcy in 2008. From its debut until 1997, the Arena Football League operated with a monopoly on the indoor game, due to a broad interpretation that virtually all of the league's rules, collectively known as [[arena football]], were covered under its patent; the [[Professional Indoor Football League (1998)|Professional Indoor Football League]] successfully defeated the AFL's legal action against it in 1997, opening the possibility for other indoor football leagues to form. Only one significant aspect of the patent, the large rebound nets the AFL has used since its debut to keep balls in play, was fully protected; the patent expired in 2007, although no other professional indoor league has adopted rebound nets since. As of 2011, two national leagues (the AFL and the [[Indoor Football League]]), along with several regional professional and semi-pro leagues, are in operation. As of 2011, no professional indoor football league has had any significant presence in Canada (despite an abundance of hockey arenas that are ideal for the game); only one indoor team, the AFL's short-lived [[Toronto Phantoms]] (2000 to 2002), has ever played its games in Canada. The all-female [[Lingerie Football League]] had operations in Canada from 2011 to 2014, but that league dropped to amateur level by the time the LFL entered the country.\n\nUp until the 1970s, semiprofessional and minor football leagues would often develop lower end players into professional prospects. Though there are still numerous teams at the semi-pro level in both the United States and Canada, they have mostly dropped to regional amateur status, and they no longer develop professional prospects, in part due to the rise of indoor football.\n\nThough Japan ([[X-League]]) and Europe ([[Austrian Football League]] and [[German Football League]]) have professional football leagues composed primarily of national citizens along with a limited number of American Imports, these leagues are generally of a lower level of play than the Western Hemisphere counterparts and have only recently begun contributing players to the American leagues on a regular basis.\n\n===Player development===\n\nProfessional football is considered the highest level of competition in gridiron football. Whereas most of the other major sports leagues draw their players from the minor leagues, the NFL currently draws almost all of its players directly from [[college football]]. College football, in turn, recruits players from [[high school football]], with most potential stars receiving scholarships to play. The source for the vast majority of professional football players is the [[Division I Bowl Subdivision]], with most coming from the five conferences with automatic bids into the [[College Football Playoff]] [[bowl game]]s. Under current regulations, players must be at least three years removed from high school graduation to qualify to play in the NFL. Because of these barriers, players who do not play college football have very few options for breaking into the league.\n\nThe college football development system is a unique feature in the professional football system, stemming from the fact that the game of American football originated at the college level, unlike other sports that were products of independent clubs. Although ostensibly amateurs, college athletes are compensated with five years of free undergraduate college education (more than enough time to pursue a [[bachelor's degree]]), room and board for their time. As a result of the college system, first-time players (rookies) enter professional football older, more mature and more prepared for the professional game than players in other sports.\n\nThe Canadian Football League has a special requirement that a minimum of half of each team's roster be composed of persons who were Canadian citizens at the time they first joined the league (prior to 2014, the restrictions were much tighter in that the person also had to be resident in Canada since childhood). As such, [[Canadian Interuniversity Sport]] feeds players to the CFL to meet these quotas, much as the NCAA does in the United States. The remaining half of the roster may be filled by either Canadians or by ''internationals'' (formerly ''imports''; these are typically American players who play in the CFL).\n\nThe NFL has, over the course of its history, recruited [[rugby union]], [[association football]] and [[Australian rules football]] players from other countries (particularly those who are retired from competition in their home countries) to play in the league, almost always as kickers and punters.\n\n==Broadcasting==\nBroadcasting is an integral part of professional football. Not only does it provide the sport with exposure to an audience wider than just the audience attending at the stadium, but it can also provide revenue in the form of rights fees.\n\nThe NFL relies on television for nearly half of its revenue; this is in part because the league only plays one game each week, leaving fewer opportunities for ticket sales than the other professional sports (in turn, however, NFL stadiums have among the highest per-game attendance thanks to large stadium capacities, figures only exceeded or matched by some of the major college football teams and by the [[NASCAR Sprint Cup]], both of which are also weekly events) and because the expense of the game (it has the largest rosters of any professional sport) makes the cost highly prohibitive. The NFL has sold broadcast rights to each of the [[Big Three television networks|major television networks]], who pay large annual fees on top of the cost of production for the rights to air the game. The networks make back much of their money through advertising and [[retransmission consent]] fees. The use of multiple broadcasters dated to before the NFL's merger with the [[American Football League]]; each competing league had its own broadcaster, both of which kept the rights to their respective conference after the merger, while additional networks were sold showcase packages of once-a-week games held at night.\n\nIn Canada, where the threat of competing sports leagues is far less, the CFL opts instead for an exclusive contract with [[The Sports Network|TSN]], available only by subscription to a cable or satellite service, to carry all of the league's games. The [[CFL on TSN]] exclusive contract began in 2008; previously, like the NFL, it split its broadcasts up between two providers.\n\nOther leagues have found it much more difficult to find an outlet on American television, much less one that pays a rights fee large enough to make it worthwhile. One of the reasons for the [[United Football League (2009)|United Football League]]'s failure was its having to pay for television coverage instead of being paid for the rights to it, along with its use of networks that were not widely available. Similarly, the [[Continental Football League]] only had one of its games televised nationally in its five-year existence, and the [[American Football Association (1978\u20131983)|American Football Association]] blamed its failure on an inability to secure television coverage.\n\nVirtually all professional football teams broadcast at least some of their games on local radio.\n\n==Rules==\nThe [[American football rules|rules of professional football]] are more likely to vary from league to league than the high school and college levels. Since interleague play is extremely rare, there is no need for a nationwide standard for all leagues, and each league will adopt and discard rules as they see fit. The [[Arena Football League]] had a patent on several of its rules that expired in 2007. Several professional leagues have experimented with rules in an effort to improve the quality of the game or to create a novelty. Nevertheless, the rules of professional football at the outdoor level are nearly identical to those at the high school and college levels, with some minor exceptions (such as the locations of [[hash marks]], procedures for [[overtime (sports)|overtime]], and the number of feet required to be in-bounds to catch a [[forward pass]]). Indoor football's rules are closely based on outdoor football but are heavily altered to compensate for the smaller field.\n\n==U.S. professional football history==\n\n===The first professional football player===\nProfessional football evolved from amateur \"club\" football, played by general interest [[sports club|athletic clubs or associations]]. These clubs began playing football in the 1880s, approximately ten years after the game took form in American colleges. Amateur club football established itself as a somewhat lower quality alternative to the more popular [[college football]]; some of the better teams would play against college teams. Eventually, some ostensibly amateur teams would secretly begin paying players a small sum to cover their expenses on an under-the-table basis, or arrange for amateur athletes to receive jobs in a company connected to the team (the [[Olympic Club]] of San Francisco, California is believed to have done the latter, thus creating the designation of \"[[semi-professional|semi-pro]]\" football in 1890, before football had gone professional); in most cases, the practice was within the rules of amateurism at the time. Many of the early semi-professional and professional teams were [[works team]]s consisting mostly of employees of the companies that sponsored them.\n\nThe first record of an American football player receiving \"pay for play\" came in 1892 with [[Pudge Heffelfinger's]] $500 contract to play in a game for the [[Allegheny Athletic Association]] against the Pittsburgh Athletic Club, with the second being [[Ben \"Sport\" Donnelly]]'s $250 contract to play for the same team the next week; the sums were very large by the standards of the day, and like most payment arrangements, both players denied any payment ever took place for much of their lives. For several years afterwards, individual players and sometimes entire teams received compensation to play in \"barnstorming\" type games without rigid schedules and against a variety of opponents. [[John Brallier]] became the first open professional after accepting $10 to play for the [[Latrobe Athletic Association]]; Latrobe became the first all-professional club soon after. [[William Chase Temple]] would become the first man to directly bankroll a football team himself when he assumed \"ownership\" of the [[Duquesne Country and Athletic Club]] in either 1898 or 1899. Throughout the 1890s, the [[Western Pennsylvania Professional Football Circuit]] would act as the ''de facto'' [[Major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada|major league]] (and, in fact, the ''only'' professional circuit) for football in the United States; it, like many of its successors, was not a \"league\" in the modern sense of a formalized organization, but rather an informal group of teams in free association with each other and any other team willing to play them.\n\nThe oldest existing professional football club is the [[Arizona Cardinals]], a current member of the National Football League. The Cardinals organization, which was originally based on Racine Street in Chicago, has operated near-continuously since 1913, but counts an earlier team that played from 1898 to 1906 as part of its history. The [[Watertown Red & Black]] is the oldest semi-professional club, tracing its history to 1896.\n\n===Early leagues: 1902\u20131919===\nWhile the practice of professional and semi-pro teams playing college and amateur teams was common in the 1890s, the [[Amateur Athletic Union]] began pressuring and threatening college teams with the loss of amateur status if they did so. Over the course of the first few years of the 20th Century, college and professional football began to diverge, until the [[NCAA]] formed in 1906, giving college football a separate sanctioning body. The stigma of being a professional athlete, and the threat it was to one's amateur status, meant that [[list of NFL nicknames|pseudonyms and nicknames]] were commonplace among professional players through the early part of the 20th century, in the hopes that covert professionals would not have themselves outed in a publicly released roster. Very few pro football players played under their given first names (John Brallier was a prominent exception). \n\nThe next step in pro football stemmed from an unusual source: baseball. Teams from each championship city (Pittsburgh and Philadelphia), three in all, received support from baseball teams in their cities and formed the [[National Football League (1902)|National Football League of 1902]], the first all-professional league. The league hoped to draw fans by featuring stars such as [[Rube Waddell]] and [[Christy Mathewson]] touring Pennsylvania and New York. It was during this time that [[Blondy Wallace]] emerged as the biggest, and most controversial, name in professional football. The league didn't draw as many fans as hoped, but promoter Tom O'Rourke considered the league to be the best teams in America. O'Rourke brought a coalition of the two Philadelphia teams to his [[World Series of Football (1902\u201303)|World Series of Football]] and immediately labeled them the favorite for the tournament, bestowing the team [[home advantage|home-field advantage]] and naming it [[New York (World Series of Football)|\"New York.\"]] New York was upset by the [[Syracuse Athletic Club]] in the first round.\n\nAn agreement between the baseball leagues to form modern [[Major League Baseball]] led directly to the end of the first NFL. From there, professional football's focus moved north and west, as teams such as the [[Massillon Tigers]] and the short-lived [[Franklin Athletic Club]] went on buying sprees in an effort to defeat local teams. Massillon's buying spree led to the rise of the [[Ohio League]], drawing much of the top professional football talent in America from Pennsylvania to Ohio, including Wallace, who signed with the [[Canton Bulldogs]]. Ohio pioneered the concept of playing games on Sundays to avoid competition with college football games; this was illegal in Pennsylvania (as well as New York City) due to still-existing [[blue law]]s, but eventually became the professional standard. A [[Canton Bulldogs-Massillon Tigers Betting Scandal|fabricated betting scandal]], coupled with a lack of competitive games and increasing price tags, effectively ruined the Ohio League by 1907. Professional football took a step back as the Ohio League relied more on local, cut-rate talent, such as player-promoter [[Peggy Parratt|George Parratt]], and its Pennsylvania counterpart also steered clear of major spending.\n\nAnother bidding war was sparked in 1915, when a revived Bulldogs signed multi-sport athletic superstar [[Jim Thorpe]] to a contract. During the late 1910s, the Ohio League not only had to compete among its own teams for talent, but also against leagues in Chicago and the [[New York Pro Football League]]. New York, with future NFL teams such as the [[Buffalo (NFL)|Buffalo Prospects]], [[Tonawanda Kardex]], and [[Rochester Jeffersons]], introduced the playoff tournament to professional football; Buffalo won the last contest in 1919. World War I and the [[1918 flu pandemic]] caused a severe disruption in professional football, which shut down most teams but allowed those that could continue (including most of the New York squads) to pick up the talent that stayed stateside, effectively ending the Ohio League's decade-long monopoly on pro football talent. [[Barnstorm (sports)|Barnstorming]] tours between the circuits, along with the continuing bidding wars, led to the regional circuits forming connections and laying the groundwork for the first truly national professional league.\n\n===American Professional Football Association: 1920\u20131921===\n\nA year after the Buffalo Prospects won the first Professional Football championship game, teams from the Ohio League organized to form the new American Professional Football Conference; two months later, adding teams from the other regional circuits surrounding Ohio, the league changed its name to the [[American Professional Football Association]] (APFA). In an effort to expand beyond the midwest, the league staged a showcase game between Canton and Buffalo at the [[Polo Grounds]] in New York City (Buffalo won) in December 1920. The league did not have a championship game or playoff, setting its championship with a vote of the league owners.  The [[Akron Pros]] had the best record in 1920, and the [[Chicago Staleys]] were the 1921 \"champions\", albeit [[1921 NFL Championship controversy|not without controversy]].\n\n===National Football League: 1922\u20131932===\n\nIn 1922, the APFA changed its name to the [[National Football League]]. While the Ohio League mostly ceased to exist after the foundation of the NFL (other than a few independent teams such as the [[Ironton Tanks]] and the pre-NFL [[Portsmouth Spartans]]), the other regional leagues continued. The New York league continued throughout the 1920s, outlasting many of the teams that it had contributed to the NFL, albeit without championships. Western Pennsylvania's league lasted until 1940. 1924 saw the foundation of eastern Pennsylvania's [[Anthracite League]], the last regional \"major league.\" The Anthracite League was won by the [[Pottsville Maroons]], who, after one year (and winning the league title), jumped to the NFL. The Anthracite League remanifested itself as the [[Eastern League of Professional Football]], an explicitly minor league, in 1926 and 1927.\n\nFrom 1922 through 1932, the NFL still declared as champions the team with the best record.  There were no set schedules, and each team did not play the same number of games: some teams played against college or other amateur teams.  The confusion reached a peak in 1925, when the aforementioned Maroons were hailed as the NFL champions by several newspapers after Pottsville defeated the Chicago Cardinals on December 6, even though there were still two weeks left in the season. This led to other teams scrambling to add extra games, including the [[Chicago Cardinals]], who won two 'extra' games and claimed the championship.  In the melee, the league cancelled games and suspended Pottsville's franchise. Through the 1920s, the smaller cities gave up on top-level pro football, while larger cities such as Boston, New York and Philadelphia saw teams take root there. This portion of the NFL's existence saw the admission of the [[Boston Braves (NFL)|Boston Braves]], owned by [[George Preston Marshall]] who was to exert major positive and negative influences on the league.\n\n===First American Football League: 1926===\n\nIn 1926, teams from nine cities ranging from the [[New York Yankees (1926 AFL)|New York Yankees]] to the [[Chicago Bulls (AFL, 1926)|Chicago Bulls]] to the [[Los Angeles Wildcats (AFL)|Los Angeles Wildcats]] (actually based in Chicago) formed the first [[American Football League (1926)|American Football League]] in competition with the NFL. Because of the 1925 shenanigans, the NFL's [[Rock Island Independents]] left the seven-year-old league to join the AFL.  The major attraction of the new league was [[Red Grange]] of the Yankees, but the league folded after just one year, with the Yankees being absorbed into the NFL.\n\n===National Football League: 1933\u20131945===\nIn 1933, the league divided into the Eastern and Western divisions, and finally instituted a championship game between the division winners.  Each team played from 10 to 13 games per season during this period, and by 1945, the league had two five-team divisions, with each team playing a 10-game regular season schedule.  In 1936, to select and assign graduating college players to particular Pro teams, the first Professional Football '[[NFL Draft|entry draft]]' was held.  The [[University of Chicago]]'s [[Heisman Trophy]]-winning running back [[Jay Berwanger]] was selected first overall by the [[Philadelphia Eagles]].  However, Berwanger chose not to play Professional Football.  The league was dominated by the [[Chicago Bears]], [[Green Bay Packers]], and [[New York Giants]], with stars like quarterback [[Sid Luckman]] (Bears); and fullbacks [[Tuffy Leemans]] (Giants) and [[Clarke Hinkle]] (Packers). Even with the stellar fullback [[Cliff Battles]], Marshall's team, now called the Redskins, was driven out of Boston in 1936 by a competing league, and he moved his franchise to Washington, D.C. as the [[Washington Redskins]].  Marshall introduced the marching band and a team song to Professional Football, along with other promotional efforts. However, he also refused to have black players on his team, and his influence resulted in the entire NFL excluding blacks after 1934. Also joining the NFL around this time was one of the last teams from Pennsylvania's independent era, the [[J.P. Rooneys|Rooneys]]; they became the Pittsburgh Pirates when they joined the NFL in 1933, later renaming themselves the [[Pittsburgh Steelers|Steelers]] as part of [[Pennsylvania Keystoners|a complicated franchise swap and abortive merger attempt]] in 1940.\n\nIn 1939, [[NBC]] broadcast the first-ever televised Professional Football game from [[Ebbets Field]], an October 22 contest between the [[Brooklyn Dodgers (NFL)|Brooklyn Dodgers]] and the [[Philadelphia Eagles]].  There were two fixed monochrome iconoscope cameras and a single play-by-play commentator, [[Skip Walz]].\n\nAlthough the NFL as a whole continued to play through World War II, the schedule was reduced, rosters were seriously impacted, and the Steelers were forced to merge operations with other NFL teams in [[Steagles|1943]] and [[Card-Pitt|1944]], while the [[Cleveland Rams]] were forced to suspend operations in 1943.\n\n===Second American Football League: 1936\u20131937===\nIn 1936, a second [[American Football League (1936)|American Football League]] of six teams was formed to challenge the NFL.  It included another [[New York Yankees (1936)|New York Yankees]] team, as well as the Cleveland Rams, the predecessor to today's [[Los Angeles Rams]].  Future [[American Football League]] (1960\u20131969) coach and Hall of Famer [[Sid Gillman]] played his only year of Professional Football with the Rams.  Before this AFL's second year, the Rams jumped to the NFL and were replaced by the first Professional Football team to actually play its home games on the West Coast, the [[Los Angeles Bulldogs]], who had several stars including quarterback [[Harry Newman]] and end [[Bill Moore (American football)|Bill Moore]]. The [[Boston Shamrocks (AFL)|Boston Shamrocks]], with all-star end [[Bill Fleming (American football)|Bill Fleming]], outdrew the NFL's Redskins in 1936, causing George Preston Marshall to move the team to Washington.  However, the league as a whole could not compete, and folded after the 1937 season.\n\nAlso in 1936, the [[American Association (football)|American Association]] was founded as a minor league. It played for five seasons, suspending operations for World War II, and returned under the \"American Football League\" name in 1946 before sputtering to a collapse in 1950.\n\n===Third American Football League: 1940\u20131941===\nStill another try at an [[American Football League (1940)|American Football League]] was made in 1940, with five franchises, including a third [[New York Yankees (1940 AFL)|New York Yankees]] team.  The league was the first major Professional Football league to complete a double round robin schedule, in which each team played each other twice.  The onset of World War II and the resultant draft dried up the source of players for professional football and the new league did not have enough resources to continue.\n\nAlso forming in 1940 was the [[Pacific Coast Professional Football League]], the first professional league on the West Coast. The PCPFL was notable for its continuous operation through World War II (it even [[American Football League (1944)|spun off a second league in 1944]]) and for its open embrace of [[black players in American professional football|black talent]] that had been blacklisted from the NFL since the 1930s. Along with the American Association and the [[Dixie League (American football)|Dixie League]], the PCPFL were members of the [[Association of Professional Football Leagues]], the first [[minor league]] compact with the NFL. The PCPFL folded in 1948 after years of declining attendance and the arrival of the NFL in its flagship Los Angeles market.\n\n===All-America Football Conference: 1946\u20131949===\nA year after World War II, another new Professional Football league was formed \u2013 the [[All-America Football Conference]] (AAFC).  It attracted some of the nation's best football players and posed a serious challenge to the NFL.  Like the pre-war AFL, it used a double round robin schedule.  The league was dominated by a franchise owned and coached by [[Paul Brown]]: the [[Cleveland Browns]], a team that would win the league's championship every year of its existence. The Browns featured players such as fullback [[Marion Motley]], quarterback [[Otto Graham]] and kicker [[Lou Groza]], while the [[San Francisco 49ers]] had running back [[Elroy Hirsch|Elroy 'Crazylegs' Hirsch]] and the [[Baltimore Colts (1947\u201350)|Baltimore Colts]] (not related to today's [[Indianapolis Colts]], which began play in Baltimore in 1953) fielded quarterback [[Y. A. Tittle]].\n\nPaul Brown made many innovations to the game on and off the field, including year-round coaching staffs, precision pass patterns, face masks, and the use of \"messenger guards\". He was the first coach to film the opposition and break down those game films in a classroom setting, also attributed to him. While the NFL was still segregated, the AAFC's Browns became the first modern Professional Football team to sign black players.\n\nAlthough many of its teams outdrew NFL teams, by 1949 the AAFC's costs had risen so steeply that the league agreed to a 'merger' with the NFL.  It was more of a 'swallowing' of the AAFC, with only the Browns, 49ers, and Colts being admitted to the established league, even though the [[Buffalo Bills (AAFC)|Buffalo Bills]] drew good crowds and raised funds from citizens to back the franchise.  Players from the Bills and the other AAFC teams not 'merged' were distributed among the NFL teams.  Motley, Graham, Groza, Hirsch and Tittle all starred in the NFL after the 'merger'.\n\nOf the three AAFC teams that joined the NFL:\n* The Colts lasted only one year in the NFL; the [[History of the Indianapolis Colts|second Baltimore Colts]] were officially a new franchise launched in 1953, though tracing their history through a series of teams dating back to 1919, before the formation of the NFL.\n* The Browns remained in Cleveland until [[Cleveland Browns relocation controversy|their controversial move]] to Baltimore, becoming the [[Baltimore Ravens]], for the [[1996 NFL season|1996 season]]. The controversy was ultimately settled by granting Cleveland a new franchise, which began play in [[1999 NFL season|1999]], that took the Browns name and official lineage.\n* The 49ers have remained in the NFL and San Francisco since their admission to the league. They moved within the [[San Francisco Bay Area|Bay Area]] media market to [[Santa Clara Stadium|a new stadium]] in the [[Silicon Valley]] community of [[Santa Clara, California|Santa Clara]] in 2014.\n\n===National Football League: 1946\u20131959===\n\nFollowing five years of what the league perceived to be weak leadership on behalf of commissioner [[Elmer Layden]] (of [[Four Horsemen of Notre Dame|Four Horsemen]] fame), league officials appointed Philadelphia Eagles owner-founder [[Bert Bell]] as commissioner in 1946.\n\nAfter twelve years without black players in the NFL, the [[Los Angeles Rams]] added them in 1946, as they were required by their stadium lease to integrate the team. The league had two five-team divisions, each team playing an unwieldy 11-game schedule, with some teams playing more home games than others.  They increased to twelve games the following year, partly because of the success of the rival AAFC's 14-game format.  After the AAFC folded, the NFL added three of its teams, for a total of thirteen, but maintained the 14-game format.  The first year after admitting the [[Cleveland Browns]], the NFL was humbled by having the Browns, a team from what it had ridiculed as an inferior league, win its championship.  The Browns went on to be NFL champions in three of their first six years in the league. In 1958, the [[History of the Indianapolis Colts|Baltimore Colts]] defeated the [[New York Giants]] 23-17 in professional football's first sudden-death championship game,{{Clarify|date=December 2009}} and repeated the victory against the same team in the 1959 NFL title game, this time by a score of 31\u201316.  The Colts had folded after the 1950 season and from 1951 through 1959 the NFL had twelve teams, six each in the East and West conferences. The league during this period featured not only star players absorbed from the AAFC 'merger' but others such as halfback [[Frank Gifford]] ([[New York Giants]]); the [[Philadelphia Eagles]]' quarterback [[Norm Van Brocklin]] and receiver [[Tommy McDonald (American football)|Tommy McDonald]]; and the Colts' quarterback [[Johnny Unitas]] and running back [[Lenny Moore]].  Television coverage of the league was spotty, with some teams starting in 1950 to have individual arrangements with the [[NFL on DuMont|Dumont Network]] and NBC.  CBS began to televise selected NFL regular season games in 1956, but there was no league-wide, national television (the Browns, for instance, held out and syndicated games themselves until the early 1960s when a league-wide contract was imposed).\n\n===Fourth American Football League: 1960\u20131969===\nBy the start of the 1960s, the NFL was complacent in its dominance of the market for Professional Football fans, and had little incentive to expand that market.  The AAFC was history, and the NFL had chosen not to capitalize on the boost it had received from the 1958 Colts-Giants sudden-death game.  It was content with a 12-team league playing a 12-game schedule and featured \"ball-control\" football.  When Texas oilmen [[Lamar Hunt]] and [[Bud Adams]] tried to purchase existing NFL franchises to move to Texas, or to establish new NFL franchises there, they were told that the conservative NFL was not interested.  The result was that Hunt and Adams joined with six other businessmen to form the fourth [[American Football League]] (1960\u20131969).  The league started out by signing half of the NFL's 1960 first-round draft choices including the [[Houston Oilers]]' [[Billy Cannon]], and never slowed down.  With future Hall of Fame Coaches [[Hank Stram]] ([[Kansas City Chiefs|Dallas Texans/Kansas City Chiefs]]) and [[Sid Gillman]] ([[San Diego Chargers|LA/San Diego Chargers]]) as well as others like the [[Buffalo Bills]]' [[Lou Saban]], the league offered a more risk-oriented on-field approach that appealed to fans.  The AFL also actively recruited from [[historically black colleges and universities|predominantly black colleges]] and other small colleges, a source the NFL virtually ignored.  This led to a higher percentage of minority players, as well as several firsts, such as the first black number one draft choice ([[Buck Buchanan]], Chiefs); the first black [[middle linebacker]], [[Willie Lanier]], Chiefs; and the first modern black starting quarterback ([[Marlin Briscoe]], Broncos).\n\nThe AFL was similar to the AAFC in that it offered innovations, like a return to the double round robin schedule introduced by the earlier league and had eight teams in two divisions like the AAFC.  The AFL also introduced official scoreboard clocks, player names on jerseys, the two-point PAT conversion and important off-the field elements such as gate and TV revenue-sharing and national TV contracts.  The AFL developed the first ever cooperative television plan for professional football, in which the proceeds of the contract were divided equally among member clubs. ABC and the AFL also introduced moving, on-field cameras (as opposed to the fixed midfield cameras of CBS and the NFL), and were the first to have players \"miked\" during broadcast games.\n\nBut the American Football League was different from the AAFC in its overall competitive balance.  While the Browns-dominated AAFC had had the same champion every year, six out of the [[Foolish Club|Original Eight]] AFL teams won at least one AFL championship, and all but one (the lone exception being the [[Denver Broncos]]) played in at least one post-season game.  In addition to traditional eastern cities, it placed teams in Texas, in the West with the Broncos, [[Oakland Raiders]] and the Chargers, and eventually in the Midwest [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]] and the deep South [[Miami]].  The league forced a merger with its rival, and made possible the [[Super Bowl]] at the end of the 1966 season. Although it lost the first two, by its demise it had beaten two NFL teams proclaimed as \"the best in history\" to win the final two World Championship games between two Professional Football league champions.  The decade ended with the AFL retaining its original franchises, plus two expansion teams, and those ten teams represented the first time a major sports league had merged with another without losing a franchise.\n\nThe legacy of the American Football League is that virtually every aspect of today's wildly popular professional football, on and off the field, can be traced to innovations developed by the AFL and adopted by the NFL.\n\n===National Football League: 1960\u20131969===\nAfter the sudden death of commissioner [[Bert Bell]] in 1959, [[Los Angeles Rams]] general manager [[Pete Rozelle]] was named his replacement after a contentious, eight-day, 23-ballot stalemated election in which the league's favored candidate, Marshall Leahy, repeatedly fell one vote short of the supermajority of votes necessary to be elected commissioner. Whereas his predecessors generally put their league offices in the city of the teams they previously represented (the key issue that prevented Leahy from becoming Commissioner, as he was previously an employee of the [[San Francisco 49ers]] and was planning to move league offices to the West Coast), Rozelle instead agreed to establish a permanent office in New York City, where the league remains to this day.\n\nThe 1960 NFL had ten teams, only two south of Washington, D.C. and/or west of Chicago (the Los Angeles Rams and San Francisco 49ers), and none in the [[Southern United States]], where college football still dominated.  Though it had rebuffed efforts to move or expand, it immediately was put on the defensive by the new AFL, first causing the owners of the proposed Minnesota franchise in that league to renege for an NFL franchise to start in 1961, and immediately establishing the Cowboys in previously rejected Dallas, as competition to Hunt's [[Dallas Texans (AFL)|Dallas Texans]]. The NFL also expanded its footprint by moving the [[Chicago Cardinals (NFL, 1920\u201359)|Chicago Cardinals]] to St. Louis, Missouri in 1960. Later, it impeded the AFL's planned expansion to Atlanta by offering that city's investor the [[Atlanta Falcons|Falcons]]' NFL franchise.  Ironically, the Falcons' replacement in the AFL were the [[Miami Dolphins]] who have appeared in five Super Bowls, winning two, while the Falcons were losers in their one appearance.  Star NFL players during this period included the Browns' fullback [[Jim Brown]]; the [[Green Bay Packers]]' quarterback [[Bart Starr]], fullback [[Jim Taylor (fullback)|Jim Taylor]] and halfback [[Paul Hornung]]; halfback [[Gale Sayers]] of the [[Chicago Bears]]; Cowboys receiver [[Bob Hayes]]; the [[Philadelphia Eagles]]' and the Redskins' [[Charley Taylor]].  The AFL's influence on the NFL was evident in several ways: in 1962, the NFL emulated the junior league by arranging its own league-wide national television contract, with CBS; and late in the 'sixties, the NFL began recognizing the wide talent pool the AFL had tapped in [[Historically Black colleges and universities|small and predominantly black colleges]], and it, too, started scouting and signing from those schools.\n\nTired of raids on players and escalating salaries, in the mid-1960s, certain NFL owners secretly approached AFL principals, seeking a merger of the two leagues.  The merger was agreed to in 1966, with a championship game to be played between the league titlists, and a merged schedule beginning with the 1970 season, when existing TV contracts could be re-worked.\nThe decade was dominated in the NFL by the Packers, who won four NFL titles, and by the mid-to late 1960s their head coach [[Vince Lombardi]] had fashioned a team that, with its ball-control style, would overpower the NFL and carry on to defeat AFL opponents in the first two AFL-NFL Championship Games after the 1966 and 1967 Professional Football seasons. The NFL champions in 1968, the Colts, and in 1969 the [[Minnesota Vikings]], were each in turn considered to be \"the best team in the history of the NFL.\"  By 1969, the NFL had grown to 16 teams, with four teams directly attributable to the existence of the AFL: the Vikings, Cowboys, and Falcons, added to compete with the AFL, and the [[New Orleans Saints]], who were added as a reward to Louisiana federal legislators for their support of PL 89-800, which permitted the merger. Likewise, the AFL-NFL wars brought two teams to Missouri (one in each league), marking the first time NFL teams had played in the state since the 1930s.\n\n===Minor Leagues: 1961\u20131973===\n\nConcurrently with the AFL and NFL rivalry, several minor leagues thrived in this era as well. The [[United Football League (1961)|United Football League]] lasted from 1961 to 1964 and was concentrated in the midwest. However, in 1962 it was quickly eclipsed by the [[Atlantic Coast Football League]], which was run by the same people (the Rosentover family) as the previous American Association of the 1930s. When the UFL folded, and the Newark Bears of the ACFL unsuccessfully applied to join the AFL, two new leagues formed: the [[Professional Football League of America]] (PFLA), which ran from 1965 to 1967, and the more prominent [[Continental Football League]] (ContFL), which ran from 1965 to 1969. The ACFL lost three of its best teams to the ContFL, but survived. The ContFL and ACFL had different strategies: the ContFL had major-league aspirations, while the ACFL was happy as a developmental league and (like previous leagues run by the Rosentovers) allowed its teams to become farm teams to the AFL and NFL teams (for instance, the [[Hartford Knights]] were a farm team to the AFL's [[Buffalo Bills]]). The ContFL arguably had better talent that went on to NFL and CFL stardom ([[Ken Stabler]], [[Don Jonas]], [[Johnnie Walton]] and [[Sam Wyche]]), but folded after 1969, and plans to take on the CFL head-to-head were abandoned. The ACFL also produced some significant talent (e.g. [[Marvin Hubbard]], [[King Corcoran|Jim Corcoran]] and the first female professional football player, placeholder [[Patricia Palinkas]]) and lasted longer, through 1971, with a return season in 1973. The attempted major [[World Football League]] sapped the ACFL of most of its talent, and forced it to fold prior to the 1974 season.\n\n===National Football League: 1970\u20131975===\nIn 1970, the NFL realigned into two conferences, with the Browns, Steelers and Colts joining the ten former American Football League teams in the [[American Football Conference]] and the remaining NFL teams forming the [[National Football Conference]]. The AFL's official scoreboard clock and jersey-back player names were adopted by the merged league, but the [[two-point conversion]] was not adopted until [[1994 NFL season|1994]].\n\nThe AFL\u2013NFL merger also led to the creation of a weekly showcase game: ''[[Monday Night Football]]''. Originally broadcast on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] beginning with the 1970 season, it moved to [[ESPN]] in 2006.\n\nAll of the American Football League records and statistics were accepted by the merged league as equivalent to pre-merger NFL records and statistics.  Thus, a yard gained in the AFL in 1960 is as valid as a yard gained in the NFL in 1960. [[American Football League All-Star games|AFL All-Star Game]] selections and appearances are equivalent to NFL 'Pro Bowl' choices.  They are equivalent, but, however, not identical, and this has caused errors in reporting by some sources.  For example, [[John Hadl]] is listed in most on-line records as having been selected for the 1970 Pro Bowl, played after the 1969 professional football season.  However, in 1970, there were both an NFL Pro Bowl and an AFL All-Star Game, the AFL event being the final event ever staged under the auspices of the American Football League.  Hadl, of the [[San Diego Chargers]] was MVP of the January 1970 AFL All-Star Game.  The January 1970 NFL Pro Bowl was a different game, featuring only NFL players. Similar errors are made when players like the [[Oakland Raiders]]' [[Jim Otto]] are cited as having \"fifteen years of NFL experience.\"  In fact, Otto had ten years of AFL experience and five years of NFL experience, or fifteen years of ''Professional Football'' experience.\n\nIn 1974, the rival [[World Football League]] successfully lured several NFL stars to its upstart league, but collapsed midway through the 1975 season due to financial problems. The [[Memphis Southmen]] made an unsuccessful bid to join the NFL, even going as far as taking deposits for season tickets and going to court to file a lawsuit to attempt to force this, and the [[Birmingham Vulcans]] collected petition signatures to attempt to show a similar high level of support, but never got as far as Memphis. Neither city has ever gotten an NFL franchise (though the [[Tennessee Titans|Tennessee Oilers]] did later play [[1998 Tennessee Oilers season|one season in Memphis]]).\n\nAlso in [[1974 NFL season|1974]], the NFL, after over four decades of having its goal posts on the goal line (as Canadian football still does), finally moved its goalposts back to the end line, as is the norm in high school and college football in the United States, in an effort to decrease the number of field goal attempts, and moved the kickoff back to the 35-yard line.\n\n===National Football League: 1976\u20131994===\nIn 1976, the NFL added the [[Seattle Seahawks]] and the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] to the NFL. To accommodate the larger league, the schedule expanded from 14 games to its current length of 16 games in 1978. The playoff field was likewise expanded to ten teams, then again to twelve teams in 1990, where it has remained ever since.\n\nThe NFL began experiencing problems in the 1980s. Labor stoppages in 1982 (which led to the NFL season being cut in half) and 1987 (resulting in the league using replacement players for three games), combined with [[Al Davis]] winning a lawsuit to allow his team, the Raiders, to move from Oakland to Los Angeles against league wishes, forced NFL Commissioner [[Pete Rozelle]] into retirement. [[Paul Tagliabue]] was named his replacement.\n\nThe NFL backed the minor-league [[World League of American Football]], a league based in the U.S., Canada, and Europe, which ran for two seasons. After its suspension, two American teams jumped to the Canadian Football League, though only one (the [[Sacramento Gold Miners|Sacramento franchise]]) would play in that league.\n\n===United States Football League: 1983\u20131985===\nThe [[United States Football League]] was the most significant challenger to the NFL since the American Football League, and the last of any significance to date. The USFL's gimmick was to avoid direct head-to-head competition with the NFL and college ball, and play in the spring. Originally intended as a minor league, this ended when several deep pocketed owners began luring top talent such as [[Herschel Walker]] to the USFL with high salaries.\n\nThe groundwork for what eventually led to the demise of the USFL was set mainly by [[Donald Trump]], owner of the [[New Jersey Generals]] and a vocal opponent of the league's spring football concept, who led a coalition that sought to take the NFL on head-to-head with a fall schedule and later force a merger. This was a major problem for several teams, who were ill-prepared to face the NFL juggernaut, and fans quickly walked away from these lame-duck franchises when it became clear the USFL was done with spring football. The USFL pinned its hopes on an anti-trust lawsuit against the NFL; though the USFL won the case, it was a [[Pyrrhic victory]], as the jury only awarded damages of US$3.\n\nThe USFL's biggest legacy was the fact that it helped develop some of the best quarterbacks in professional football during the 1990s. Many members of the prolific draft classes of 1983 through 1985 played in the USFL and went on to have strong careers in the NFL and CFL, including [[Steve Young (American football)|Steve Young]], [[Jim Kelly]], [[Doug Williams (American football)|Doug Williams]] (who was actually drafted several years earlier, in 1978), [[Bobby Hebert]] and [[Doug Flutie]].\n\n===Arena Football League: 1987\u20132019===\n\nImmediately after the USFL suspended operations in 1986, USFL executive [[Jim Foster (arena football)|James F. \"Jim\" Foster]] began work on a brand new variant of football. Known as \"[[arena football]]\", the sport was played on a much shorter 50-yard field and was built heavily on a high-scoring offensive game. After two test games, he launched a professional league, the [[Arena Football League]], in 1987. The AFL began its 24th season in 2011, and is currently the United States' second longest running professional football league ever, after the NFL. The AFL also had a minor league, [[AF2]], which ran for 10 seasons, from 2000 to 2009. The current version of the Arena Football League is technically the second league to bear that name; the first collapsed under the weight of bankruptcy after the 2008 season, then was bought by a coalition of its teams and relaunched in 2010 in its current incarnation. From a high of 18 teams in 2011, the second Arena Football League steadily shrunk until bottoming out at four teams in 2018. The league folded a second time after its 2019 season.\n\nThe success of arena football led to a revival of interest in [[indoor American football|indoor football]], particularly after the AFL lost a lawsuit over the extent of its patents in 1998. As of 2020, all of the leagues who play the indoor game play regionally, either in the midwest ([[Indoor Football League]] and [[Champions Indoor Football]]), southeast ([[National Arena League]] and [[American Arena League]]) or northwest ([[America West Football Conference]]). One unusual variant of indoor football was the [[Legends Football League|Lingerie Football League]], in which scantily clad women play the game by a modified variant of indoor rules; that league was at least semi-professional for its first two years, but since 2011, it (along with its successor league, the Legends Football League) has played at an amateur level.\n\n===National Football League: 1995\u20132001===\nThe USFL's impact was not limited to players, however. The USFL apparently established Oakland, Baltimore, Jacksonville and Arizona as viable markets for professional football. As such, the St. Louis Cardinals moved to Phoenix, Arizona to become the [[Arizona Cardinals]] in 1988, while the Houston Oilers very nearly moved to Jacksonville in 1987 before deciding to stay, for the short term, in Houston.\n\nIn 1993, the NFL began exploring expansion, eyeing five proposals ([[Baltimore Bombers (proposed NFL team)|Baltimore]], [[St. Louis Stallions|St. Louis]], [[Memphis Hound Dogs|Memphis]], Charlotte and Jacksonville), all of which were in cities that had hosted professional football before. The \"Carolina Cougars\" (later renamed [[Carolina Panthers]]) and [[Jacksonville Jaguars]] received franchises to begin play in 1995. At the same time, Al Davis moved the Raiders back to its original home in Oakland for the 1995 season, while at the same time, the Rams, who had suffered in attendance since the Raiders' arrival, relocated to St. Louis; the concurrent departures of both teams from southern California began a 21-year stretch in which [[History of the National Football League in Los Angeles|the league had no teams in Los Angeles]].\n\nIt was not until after the 1995 season, after Baltimore's CFL team won the Grey Cup, that Baltimore got a second look, this time from Art Modell, who took the core of his Cleveland Browns team to Baltimore to found the expansion [[Baltimore Ravens]]. The effort effectively killed the CFL's American expansion. The Browns returned, restocked with new players and with new ownership, in 1999. Meanwhile, the Oilers left Houston for Tennessee after the 1996 season; initially beginning what was planned to be a two-year stint in Memphis, disastrous attendance levels prompted the team to cut that experiment short after a single year and move to its permanent home in Nashville in 1998, eventually rebranding as the [[Tennessee Titans]].\n\nAlso borrowed from the USFL was the [[two-point conversion]], which the NFL adopted in 1994, and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers' color scheme, which was loosely based on that of the [[Tampa Bay Bandits]].\n\nThe NFL revived the World League in 1995, this time headquartered solely in Europe, eventually changing the name of the league to the NFL Europe League (known as either [[NFL Europe]] or, in its last season, as NFL Europa, to avoid [[RAS syndrome]]). Originally having its teams spread across several countries including Spain, England, Scotland, the Netherlands and Germany, by the end of the league's run in 2007, only the Netherlands and Germany (the latter of which had five of the league's six teams) were still in the league.\n\nStrained relations between the NFL and its players' union quieted down significantly in the 1990s, and the development of [[free agency]] as well as a [[salary cap]] led to peaceful relations between the two entities for over a decade. This was helped by new [[NFL on television|television contracts]]: in 1994, [[Fox Broadcasting Company]] set the tone for broadcast rights to the NFL when it outbid CBS for the right to air NFC games with an unheard-of bid of US$395,000,000. This brought total broadcast rights fees for the league to over US$1,000,000,000. In 1998, when CBS outbid NBC for the rights to the AFC, the total rights fees doubled to over US$2,000,000,000. This is in addition to the rights fee for [[NFL Sunday Ticket]], a package offered exclusively to the [[DirecTV]] satellite television service, that began in the mid-1990s.\n\nSeveral short-lived professional leagues arose in the wake of the [[dot-com boom]] in the late 1990s. The [[Regional Football League]] played one season in 1999, and the [[Spring Football League]] played only two weeks in 2000. The short-lived, highly publicized and widely derided [[XFL (2001)|XFL]] played one season in the winter of 2001.\n\n===National Football League: 2002\u2013present===\nThe [[Houston Texans]] were added to the league in 2002 to replace the Oilers, bringing the league to an even 32 teams. [[Roger Goodell]] took over as commissioner from the retiring Paul Tagliabue in 2006.\n\nAlso during this era, the league began expanding its influence overseas. [[F\u00fatbol Americano]], a one-off game in Mexico City, was the first regular-season game held outside the United States in 2005; it was followed by the [[NFL International Series]], an annual game held in London in the last week of October since 2007. In an unrelated move, the [[Buffalo Bills]] began their [[Bills Toronto Series]], playing an annual December game in Canada, in 2008. The Toronto series will run through 2012.\n\nIn 2003, the NFL launched its own in-house network, [[NFL Network]]. Beginning in 2006, at the end of the previous broadcast contract, the NFL launched an [[Thursday Night Football|eight-game late-season package]] specifically for the network. The 2006 television contract expanded total annual broadcast rights to over US$3,000,000,000, and the 2011 renewal of those rights pushed the annual total to nearly US$5,000,000,000. Between 2006 and 2022, the networks will have paid the NFL nearly US$70,000,000,000\u2014a total greater than the resale value of all thirty-two NFL teams combined.\n\nThe labor peace in the NFL came to a halt in 2010, when a group of NFL owners invoked an out clause in the league's collective bargaining agreement with the players' union, subsequently imposing a lockout in 2011. The players' association responded by disbanding and having its players sue the league for antitrust violations. The two sides came to an agreement in late July 2011, after one preseason game, that year's [[Pro Football Hall of Fame Game]], was lost due to the lockout. The current collective bargaining agreement, which has no opt-outs, lasts through 2021.\n\n===Alternate leagues: 2009\u20132015, 2019\u2013future===\nThe [[United Football League (2009)|United Football League]] began play in 2009 with an abbreviated \"Premiere Season\" that featured four teams, two on each coast, in a six-week schedule. The UFL, which mostly featured former NFL players, marked the first professional fall league other than the [[National Football League]] to play in the United States since the [[World Football League]] in the mid-1970s.  All UFL games aired on [[Versus (TV channel)|Versus]] and [[HDnet]]; every game was also [[webcast]]. The league returned in 2010 with a new expansion team in Omaha, Nebraska and an eight-game, ten-week schedule. From there, however, the UFL collapsed, cutting both its 2011 and 2012 seasons short after four weeks of play and failing to pay most of its bills in a timely manner.\n\nThe [[Stars Football League]] began play as a four-team league on June 30, 2011, with an eight-week schedule, and played three abbreviated seasons. The [[Fall Experimental Football League]], an explicitly minor league operating on a sort of \"extended [[National Football League preseason|preseason]]\" approach, played two seasons before being replaced with [[The Spring League]], which is non-professional. Numerous other professional leagues attempted to launch in the late 2000s and early 2010s but never materialized, including the [[All American Football League]], the [[United National Gridiron League]] and [[A-11 Football League]].\n\nIn 2018, the two leading figures behind the original XFL announced their re-entry into the professional football market with rival leagues: former NBC head [[Dick Ebersol]] attached to the [[Alliance of American Football]] to begin play in 2019; it collapsed amid financial shortfalls and disputes partway through its lone season. [[Vince McMahon]] reacquired the XFL intellectual property rights and launched a [[XFL (2020)|second version of the XFL]] in 2020 to somewhat greater success and reception.\n\n==Canadian professional football history==\n{{See also|History of Canadian football|professional football in Canada}}\nCanadian football had similar origins to its American counterparts. Several Canadian professional teams are older than the oldest existing American teams, because they began as amateur rugby organizations. The Canadian game evolved parallel to the American game, but several years behind: the [[Burnside Rules]] were adopted in 1905, and the [[forward pass]] (in place on the American side of the border since 1906) was adopted in 1929 after significant pressure from American coaches. The touchdown remained worth five points until 1956 (it changed mainly due to Canadian pro football holding an American TV contract), whereas it had increased to six points in 1912 in the United States. Several relics of the old rules of the game, including goal posts on the goal line, a 110-yard field, more liberal rules for use of the [[drop kick]], and only three downs, remain in the Canadian game.\n\nCanadian football was, prior to the 1950s, dominated by three amateur organizations: the [[Ontario Rugby Football Union]] (ORFU), the [[Interprovincial Rugby Football Union]] (IRFU, or \"Big Four\"), and the [[Western Interprovincial Football Union]] (WIFU). By 1954, the IRFU and WIFU had gone professional (in part thanks to an American television contract from NBC that paid the Big Four more than the one DuMont was offering the NFL), and in that year the ORFU dropped out of competition for the decades-old [[Grey Cup]], the championship of Canadian football. This is generally recognized as the moment that began the modern era of Canadian professional football. The WIFU and IRFU incrementally merged into one league over the next several years: the two created the Canadian Football Council in 1956, jointly separated from the Canadian Rugby Union (Canada's governing body for football, now known as [[Football Canada]]) in 1958, and began inter-union play in 1961. The CFL currently recognizes the [[1958 CFL season|1958 season]], its first separate from Football Canada, as its starting point. (The ORFU eventually faded out of existence in the 1970s.)\n\nThe CFL has been, at various times in its history, competitive with the NFL in terms of being able to acquire talent, though the league's self-imposed rule changes have hampered that in recent years (for instance, the marquee player exemption to the salary cap that once allowed CFL teams to sign one top-level player is no longer there, and the league has banned signing suspended NFL players). It has not been competitive on a team level with the NFL, as evidenced by the fact that in a series of interleague matchups between the IRFU and the NFL in the 1950s and 1960s, the NFL won all six matches. (The Hamilton Tiger-Cats, the best team in the IRFU at the time, ''did'' win one game against an American pro team in 1961, but it was an American Football League team, not an NFL team.)\n\nThe league attempted an [[CFL USA|American expansion]] in 1993. Initially starting with the [[Sacramento Gold Miners]] (who jumped more or less intact from the WLAF and would become the [[San Antonio Texans]] in 1995), by 1995 the CFL had five U.S. teams, mostly based in the southern and western United States. The league itself was suffering from financial problems at the time, and the general suspicion was that the addition of American teams was mainly a gambit to net expansion revenue for the eight remaining Canadian franchises. The league did lure credible and stable owners for most of the American teams (a contrast from other efforts at U.S. pro football outside the NFL), but lack of respect from the established Canadian teams, poor attendance in most markets, a handful of particularly problematic owners on both the American and Canadian sides of the border, and an inability to secure a television contract because of the league's avoidance of major U.S. markets all led to tens of millions of dollars in financial losses and the end of the American experiment after the 1995 season.\n\nThe two teams based in [[Ottawa]] and [[Montr\u00e9al]] have been in flux for the past three decades. The original Alouettes folded in 1982; a [[Montreal Concordes]] team was founded the same year to replace them, but the Concordes (which renamed themselves the Alouettes in 1986) folded prior to 1987. The current Alouettes arrived in Montr\u00e9al in 1996, absorbing the two previous Montr\u00e9al teams'  histories but disowning that of the team that formed its basis, the [[Baltimore Stallions]]; the Stallions were the only American team to be both an on-field and off-field success and are the only U.S.-based team to ever win the Grey Cup. The Alouettes' situation was largely stable for the first two decades after relaunch before a sudden collapse in the team's finances forced its owner to return the franchise to the league in 2019. The [[Ottawa Rough Riders]] folded in 1996; the [[Ottawa Renegades]] were named as Ottawa's next CFL team from 2002 to 2005, but that team also folded. In both the Rough Riders and Renegades cases, the team failures came during, or shortly after, [[Bernard Glieberman]] had purchased the respective team. In 2014, the new [[Ottawa Redblacks]] (owned by [[Jeff Hunt]]) began play at a drastically refurbished [[Frank Clair Stadium]], thus becoming the third Ottawa CFL team and returning the league back to the traditional nine teams. Although Hunt owns the rights to the former [[Ottawa Rough Riders|Rough Riders]] intellectual property and based the Redblacks' logo and colors on those of the Rough Riders, he chose the name RedBlacks in June 2013, mainly to avoid a trademark dispute with the similarly named [[Saskatchewan Roughriders]]. The revived Ottawa franchise has also been a success.\n\nIn the long term, the CFL has shown significantly more stability than the American leagues. The league has, for all but three years of its history, had either eight or nine teams, all based in the same nine markets. The league has resisted expanding beyond its current nine teams and has, to date, never moved a Canadian team from one city to another. One particular market that has been a persistent topic of discussion has been the [[maritime provinces]]. The CFL approved an Atlantic franchise for [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax]] known as the [[Atlantic Schooners]] in 1984 provided a stadium with sufficient capacity was built by then; however, no such stadium was ever built (the only outdoor stadium in Halifax, [[Huskies Stadium]], only seated less than half of what CFL rules mandate and has since been demolished). The [[Touchdown Atlantic]] series is a series of one-off games that are played in Atlantic region stadiums; the first, a preseason game, was held at Huskies Stadium in 2003. A follow-up game was scheduled for the same venue for 2006, but was canceled due to the Ottawa Renegades (who were to play in the game) folding. The series was revived as a regular season game in 2010, but instead at [[New Moncton Stadium]] in [[Moncton]], which is much closer to the CFL's capacity guidelines; three games were played in the regular season series, with a fourth slated for 2019 as [[Schooners Sports and Entertainment|another Atlantic Schooners proposal]] is seeking to join the league.\n\nCanada has historically been sheltered from the rival leagues that the NFL faced for most of its first century of existence. [[John F. Bassett]], a Canadian multimedia heir, was at the center of two attempts to bring the rival leagues to Canada, first with the [[Toronto Northmen]] in the WFL, then with a USFL team in [[Hamilton, Ontario]]. In both cases, Canadian Parliament threatened to pass the [[Canadian Football Act]], a proposed law that would have codified the CFL's monopoly on football and outlawed any other professional league from playing in the dominion. (In each case, Bassett instead backed a U.S.-based team, the [[Memphis Southmen]] and [[Tampa Bay Bandits]], respectively). The Act was never passed or made law.\n\nProfessional football has yet to be played in two provinces: [[Prince Edward Island]] (which is likely too small to accommodate any professional game) and [[Newfoundland and Labrador]].\n\n==Further reading==\n*[[Harry March|March, Harry]].
