He was one of the foremost French composers of his generation, and his musical style influenced many 20th-century composers. Among his best-known works are his ''[[Pavane (Faur\u00e9)|Pavane]]'',<ref>[[Gabriel Faure|Faure, Gabriel]].  (1913).  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tQ36TFvNoM 'Gabriel Faure plays Pavane, Op. 50, 1913 Welte Mignon recording.'].

Although his best-known and most accessible compositions are generally his earlier ones, Faur\u00e9 composed many of his most highly regarded works in his later years, in a more [[harmony|harmonically]] and [[melody|melodically]]  complex style.\n\nFaur\u00e9 was born into a cultured but not especially musical family. His talent became clear when he was a small boy. At the age of nine, he was sent to the [[\u00c9cole Niedermeyer de Paris|Ecole Niedermeyer]] music college in Paris, where he was trained to be a church organist and choirmaster. The Ecole Neidermeyer's pedagogy differed greatly from that of the [[Paris Conservatoire]]. Among his teachers was [[Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns]], who became a lifelong friend. After graduating from the college in 1865, Faur\u00e9 earned a modest living as an organist and teacher, leaving him little time for composition. When he became successful in his middle age, holding the important posts of organist of the [[\u00c9glise de la Madeleine]] and director of the [[Conservatoire de Paris|Paris Conservatoire]], he still lacked time for composing; he retreated to the countryside in the summer holidays to concentrate on composition. By his last years, Faur\u00e9 was recognised in France as the leading French composer of his day. An unprecedented national musical tribute was held for him in Paris in 1922, headed by the president of the [[French Third Republic|French Republic]]. Outside France, Faur\u00e9's music took decades to become widely accepted, except in Britain, where he had many admirers during his lifetime.\n\nFaur\u00e9's music has been described as linking the end of [[Romantic music|Romanticism]] with the [[modernism (music)|modernism]] of the second quarter of the 20th century. When he was born, [[Chopin]] was still composing, and by the time of Faur\u00e9's death, [[jazz]] and the [[atonality|atonal]] music of the [[Second Viennese School]] were being heard. The ''[[Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]'', which describes him as the most advanced composer of his generation in France, notes that his harmonic and melodic innovations influenced the teaching of harmony for later generations. During the last twenty years of his life, he suffered from increasing deafness. In contrast with the charm of his earlier music, his works from this period are sometimes elusive and withdrawn in character, and at other times turbulent and impassioned.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early years===\nFaur\u00e9 was born in [[Pamiers]], [[Ari\u00e8ge (department)|Ari\u00e8ge]], in the south of France, the fifth son and youngest of six children of Toussaint-Honor\u00e9 Faur\u00e9 (1810\u201385) and Marie-Antoinette-H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Lal\u00e8ne-Laprade (1809\u201387).<ref name=d3>Duchen, p. 13</ref> According to the biographer [[Jean-Michel Nectoux]], the Faur\u00e9 family dates to the 13th century in that part of France.<ref name=n3>Nectoux (1991), p. 3</ref> The family had at one time been substantial landowners, but by the 19th century its means had become reduced.

With the second volume of the sixty collected songs written during the next two decades, Copland judged, came the first mature examples of \"the real Faur\u00e9\". He instanced \"Les berceaux\", \"Les roses d'Ispahan\" and especially \"[[Clair de lune (Faur\u00e9)|Clair de lune]]\" as \"so beautiful, so perfect, that they have even penetrated to America\", and drew attention to less well known m\u00e9lodies such as \"Le secret\", \"Nocturne\", and \"Les pr\u00e9sents\".<ref name=copland/> Faur\u00e9 also composed a number of [[song cycle]]s.

In Faur\u00e9's late style, \"tonality is stretched hard, without breaking.\"<ref>Murray, p. 120</ref> On the rare occasions when the piece has been staged, critical opinion has generally praised the musical quality of the score, but has varied as to the dramatic effectiveness of the work.

He was one of the foremost French composers of his generation, and his musical style influenced many 20th-century composers. Among his best-known works are his ''[[Pavane (Faur\u00e9)|Pavane]]'',<ref>[[Gabriel Faure|Faure, Gabriel]].  (1913).  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tQ36TFvNoM 'Gabriel Faure plays Pavane, Op. 50, 1913 Welte Mignon recording.'].  [[YouTube]].</ref> [[Requiem (Faur\u00e9)|Requiem]], ''[[Sicilienne (Faur\u00e9)|Sicilienne]]'', [[Faur\u00e9 Nocturnes|nocturnes]] for piano and the songs [[Trois m\u00e9lodies, Op. 7 (Faur\u00e9)|\"Apr\u00e8s un r\u00eave\"]] and [[Clair de lune (Faur\u00e9)|\"Clair de lune\"]]. Although his best-known and most accessible compositions are generally his earlier ones, Faur\u00e9 composed many of his most highly regarded works in his later years, in a more [[harmony|harmonically]] and [[melody|melodically]]  complex style.\n\nFaur\u00e9 was born into a cultured but not especially musical family. His talent became clear when he was a small boy. At the age of nine, he was sent to the [[\u00c9cole Niedermeyer de Paris|Ecole Niedermeyer]] music college in Paris, where he was trained to be a church organist and choirmaster. The Ecole Neidermeyer's pedagogy differed greatly from that of the [[Paris Conservatoire]]. Among his teachers was [[Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns]], who became a lifelong friend. After graduating from the college in 1865, Faur\u00e9 earned a modest living as an organist and teacher, leaving him little time for composition. When he became successful in his middle age, holding the important posts of organist of the [[\u00c9glise de la Madeleine]] and director of the [[Conservatoire de Paris|Paris Conservatoire]], he still lacked time for composing; he retreated to the countryside in the summer holidays to concentrate on composition. By his last years, Faur\u00e9 was recognised in France as the leading French composer of his day. An unprecedented national musical tribute was held for him in Paris in 1922, headed by the president of the [[French Third Republic|French Republic]]. Outside France, Faur\u00e9's music took decades to become widely accepted, except in Britain, where he had many admirers during his lifetime.\n\nFaur\u00e9's music has been described as linking the end of [[Romantic music|Romanticism]] with the [[modernism (music)|modernism]] of the second quarter of the 20th century. When he was born, [[Chopin]] was still composing, and by the time of Faur\u00e9's death, [[jazz]] and the [[atonality|atonal]] music of the [[Second Viennese School]] were being heard. The ''[[Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]'', which describes him as the most advanced composer of his generation in France, notes that his harmonic and melodic innovations influenced the teaching of harmony for later generations. During the last twenty years of his life, he suffered from increasing deafness. In contrast with the charm of his earlier music, his works from this period are sometimes elusive and withdrawn in character, and at other times turbulent and impassioned.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early years===\nFaur\u00e9 was born in [[Pamiers]], [[Ari\u00e8ge (department)|Ari\u00e8ge]], in the south of France, the fifth son and youngest of six children of Toussaint-Honor\u00e9 Faur\u00e9 (1810\u201385) and Marie-Antoinette-H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Lal\u00e8ne-Laprade (1809\u201387).<ref name=d3>Duchen, p. 13</ref> According to the biographer [[Jean-Michel Nectoux]], the Faur\u00e9 family dates to the 13th century in that part of France.<ref name=n3>Nectoux (1991), p. 3</ref> The family had at one time been substantial landowners, but by the 19th century its means had become reduced.

The quality of constant renewal within an apparently limited range&nbsp;... is a remarkable facet of his genius, and the spare, elliptical style of his single String Quartet suggests that his intensely self-disciplined style was still developing at the time of his death\".<ref>Orledge, Robert.

Due to her father's skill with cloth dyeing, Arachne became adept in the art of weaving. Eventually, she began to consider herself to be a greater weaver than the goddess Athena herself, and challenged the goddess to a weaving contest to prove her superior skill.

The goddess conceded that Arachne's weaving was flawless, but she was infuriated by the mortal's pride.

One of the most notable characters in comic book history has taken his identity from the spider, the [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] comic book hero [[Spider-Man]]. Peter Parker was accidentally bitten by a radioactive spider and then, as Spider-Man, was able to scale tall buildings and shoot web fluid from a device attached to his wrist. Along with these abilities, came super senses and instant reflexes. Writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Steve Ditko]] originated this franchise. Due to the character's popularity, Spider-Man appeared in [[Spider-Man in other media|movies and various other media]]. In addition to Spider-Man, the [[Marvel Universe]] includes several subsequent characters using the spider as their patron; including [[Spider-Woman]], [[Spider-Girl (Mayday Parker)|Spider-Girl]], the [[Scarlet Spider]], [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]], [[Ara\u00f1a]], the [[Black Widow (Natasha Romanova)|Black Widow]], and the [[Tarantula (Marvel Comics)|Tarantula]]. The [[DC Comics]] [[DC Universe|universe]] also include characters named [[Spider Girl]] and the [[Tarantula (DC Comics)|Tarantula]].\n\nMany other comic book, [[manga]] and [[anime]] characters have taken the guise of a spider, such as the [[Black Spider]] from the [[Batman]] universe;<ref name =\"Black spider\">{{cite book |last=Moench |author2=Jones & Beatty |title=''Batman'' #518|date=May 1995 |publisher=[[DC Comics]]}}</ref> in the [[Pok\u00e9mon]] franchise, [[Spinarak]] and [[Ariados]], [[Joltik]] and [[Galvantula]], and [[Dewpider]] and [[Araquanid]], are all variously based on spiders. In the ''[[Static Shock]]'' series, [[Static Shock|Anansi the Spider]] takes his name and techniques from the African trickster god. In the second season of the anime based on the manga ''[[Kuroshitsuji]]'', one main antagonist, the demon butler Claude Faustus, has spiderlike qualities and powers. He is also capable of transforming into a spider and making webs.\n\nIn the manga ''[[The Saga of Darren Shan]]'', the titular character is fascinated by spiders. He kept them as pets until he killed one that he got when he was nine years old. He used to let them go into his mouth and he would imagine them eating him from the inside out. Normally, the spiders would stay with him for about a day or two, but some lasted longer. Later on, we find out that he can communicate with spiders.\n\nThe manga ''[[Ghost in The Shell]]'' by [[Masamune Shirow]] prominently features spiderlike, AI-equipped, multi-legged combat vehicles called [[Fuchikoma]] (evolving into the [[Tachikoma]], Uchikoma and Logicoma in subsequent anime versions of the series). These mobile weapon platforms are used by the members of [[Section 9]] to aid in their various missions.\nIn the manga ''[[Monster Musume]]'' by [[Okayado]], the character Rachnera Arachnera is an Arachne who is feared by her host family and initially abandoned. She demonstrates skills in web weaving. She initially hated humans for how judgmental they were of her,\nbut Kimihito was able to change her mind;\nshe now lives with him.\n\nThe [[light novel]] and manga series ''[[So I'm a Spider, So What?]]'', the protagonist is turned into a spider at the beginning of the story. Trapped in a world based around Japanese role-playing game [[Trope (literature)|trope]]s, she makes use of webs, various types of poison and venom attacks, and her intellect to survive.<ref>Kakashi, A., & Baba, O.

One of the most notable characters in comic book history has taken his identity from the spider, the [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] comic book hero [[Spider-Man]]. Peter Parker was accidentally bitten by a radioactive spider and then, as Spider-Man, was able to scale tall buildings and shoot web fluid from a device attached to his wrist. Along with these abilities, came super senses and instant reflexes. Writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Steve Ditko]] originated this franchise. Due to the character's popularity, Spider-Man appeared in [[Spider-Man in other media|movies and various other media]]. In addition to Spider-Man, the [[Marvel Universe]] includes several subsequent characters using the spider as their patron; including [[Spider-Woman]], [[Spider-Girl (Mayday Parker)|Spider-Girl]], the [[Scarlet Spider]], [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]], [[Ara\u00f1a]], the [[Black Widow (Natasha Romanova)|Black Widow]], and the [[Tarantula (Marvel Comics)|Tarantula]]. The [[DC Comics]] [[DC Universe|universe]] also include characters named [[Spider Girl]] and the [[Tarantula (DC Comics)|Tarantula]].\n\nMany other comic book, [[manga]] and [[anime]] characters have taken the guise of a spider, such as the [[Black Spider]] from the [[Batman]] universe;<ref name =\"Black spider\">{{cite book |last=Moench |author2=Jones & Beatty |title=''Batman'' #518|date=May 1995 |publisher=[[DC Comics]]}}</ref> in the [[Pok\u00e9mon]] franchise, [[Spinarak]] and [[Ariados]], [[Joltik]] and [[Galvantula]], and [[Dewpider]] and [[Araquanid]], are all variously based on spiders. In the ''[[Static Shock]]'' series, [[Static Shock|Anansi the Spider]] takes his name and techniques from the African trickster god. In the second season of the anime based on the manga ''[[Kuroshitsuji]]'', one main antagonist, the demon butler Claude Faustus, has spiderlike qualities and powers. He is also capable of transforming into a spider and making webs.\n\nIn the manga ''[[The Saga of Darren Shan]]'', the titular character is fascinated by spiders. He kept them as pets until he killed one that he got when he was nine years old. He used to let them go into his mouth and he would imagine them eating him from the inside out. Normally, the spiders would stay with him for about a day or two, but some lasted longer. Later on, we find out that he can communicate with spiders.\n\nThe manga ''[[Ghost in The Shell]]'' by [[Masamune Shirow]] prominently features spiderlike, AI-equipped, multi-legged combat vehicles called [[Fuchikoma]] (evolving into the [[Tachikoma]], Uchikoma and Logicoma in subsequent anime versions of the series). These mobile weapon platforms are used by the members of [[Section 9]] to aid in their various missions.\nIn the manga ''[[Monster Musume]]'' by [[Okayado]], the character Rachnera Arachnera is an Arachne who is feared by her host family and initially abandoned. She demonstrates skills in web weaving. She initially hated humans for how judgmental they were of her,\nbut Kimihito was able to change her mind;\nshe now lives with him.\n\nThe [[light novel]] and manga series ''[[So I'm a Spider, So What?]]'', the protagonist is turned into a spider at the beginning of the story. Trapped in a world based around Japanese role-playing game [[Trope (literature)|trope]]s, she makes use of webs, various types of poison and venom attacks, and her intellect to survive.<ref>Kakashi, A., & Baba, O.
