This may include colouring agents such as [[elderberry]] juice, and flavourings such as [[cinnamon]] at best, or less desirable additives at worst. Some varieties of wine have sought after characteristics.

In [[ancient Rome]], [[Pliny the Elder]] complained about the abundance of fraudulent [[Roman wine]] which was so great that even the [[patrician (ancient Rome)|nobility]] could not be assured that the wine they were pouring on their table was genuine. For the poor and middle class of Rome, local bar establishments seemed to have an unlimited supply of the prestigious [[Falernian wine]] for unusually low prices.<ref name=\"Oxford pg 4\">J. Robinson (ed) ''\"The Oxford Companion to Wine\"'' Third Edition pg 4 & 26-27 Oxford University Press 2006 {{ISBN|0-19-860990-6}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Middle Ages]], wines from questionable origins were often passed off as wines from more prestigious regions. In [[London]], local authorities established laws for tavern owners prohibiting [[French (wine)|French]], [[Spanish (wine)|Spanish]], and [[German wines]] from being [[cellared (wine)|cellared]] together so as to prevent the potential for mixing the wines or falsely representing them to the consumer. If a producer or merchant was found selling fraudulent or \"corrupt wine\", they were forced to drink all of it. In medieval Germany, the penalty for selling fraudulent wine ranged from [[human branding|branding]] to [[assault|beating]] to [[death penalty|death]] by [[hanging]].<ref name=\"Oxford pg 4\"/>\n\nDuring the [[Age of Enlightenment]], advancements in science ushered in a new occupation of \"wine doctors\" who could fashion examples of wines from obscure items and chemicals. Writers like [[Joseph Addison]] wrote of this \"fraternity of chymical operators (sic)\" who would use [[apples]] to make [[Champagne (wine)|Champagne]] and [[sloe]] to make [[Bordeaux (wine)|Bordeaux]] and then sell these wines fraudulently on the market. Following the [[Phylloxera epidemic]], when true wine was scarce, wine fraud rose. Some merchants would take dried raisins grown from other [[Vitis|species of grapevines]] and make wine that they passed off as being from a more prestigious [[provenance]] such as the more well known wines from [[France (wine)|France]] or [[Italy (wine)|Italy]].<ref name=\"Oxford pg 4\"/>\n\nIn the early 19th century, several European writers wrote about the risk and prevalence of wine fraud. In 1820, German chemist [[Friedrich Accum]] noted that wine was one of the commodities most at risk for being fraudulently manipulated and misrepresented. In 1833, the British wine writer [[Cyrus Redding]] echoed the alarm over the unchecked operations of these \"wine doctors\". Eventually the concern over wine fraud grew enough that provisions against the adulteration and misrepresentation of wine was included in [[British Parliament]]'s [[Adulteration of Food and Drink Act 1860]]. Several European governments also enacted legislation defining what exactly constitutes \"wine\" so as to distinguish authentic winemaking from the workings of these wine counterfeiters. The French government first legally defined wine as the product of fermented grape juice in 1889, followed by the German government in 1892 (later expanded in 1909) and the Italian government in 1904.<ref name=\"Oxford pg 4\"/>\n\nFraud of a different nature occurred during [[prohibition in the United States]], when wine production was illegal, as grape merchants would sell \"bricks\" of grape [[concentrate]] across the United States along with a packet of [[yeast (wine)|dried yeast]].<ref name=\"Oxford pg 4\"/> The bricks would come with a \"[[warning label]]\" cautioning people not to mix the contents of the brick, yeast, water, and sugar in a pot and then seal such pot for seven days, or else \"an illegal alcoholic beverage will result\".<ref name=\"MacNeil pg 630-631\">K. MacNeil ''The Wine Bible'' pg 630-631 Workman Publishing 2001 {{ISBN|1-56305-434-5}}</ref>\n\n===Practices that were once considered fraudulent===\nThe practice of adding grape spirits to wine was once considered manipulative and fraudulent but today is accepted practice for the production of all fortified wines, like [[Portwine|Port]].\n\nOver the years, [[winemaking]] techniques have evolved. The first, primitive \"[[natural wine]]\" or \"authentic wine\" was most likely the result of crushed grapes being forgotten while stored in a container. The process of allowing wild [[yeast]] found on the surface of the grape conduct [[fermentation (wine)|fermentation]] in an uncontrolled environment creates a very crude style of wine that may not be palatable to many people. Hence the development of various techniques and practices designed to improve the quality of the wine but which could be viewed as \"manipulating\" or \"adulterating\" the wine from its natural or \"authentic state\". At various points in history, these techniques may be considered \u201ctoo much\u201d manipulation, more than what a consumer would likely expect, and thus labeled as \"fraud\". However as these techniques became more common place in the wine industry, they gained an air of acceptability and eventually became just another tool in the winemaker's tool box to help craft good-quality wine.<ref name=\"Bird pgs 1-7, 223-233\">D. Bird ''Understanding Wine Technology'' pgs 1-7, 223-233 DBQA Publishing 2005 {{ISBN|1-891267-91-4}}</ref>\n\nMost techniques of manipulation arose from need. Early wine had many [[wine faults]] that caused a wine to spoil quickly. Classical writings from the Greeks and Romans detailed recipes that could cure \"sick wines\". These include adding various items like [[milk]], ground [[Mustard seed|mustard]], [[wood ash|ashes]], [[Urtica|nettles]], and [[lead]]. Another example of early \"manipulation\" that became accepted, common practice was the process of adding [[grape spirit]] to wine made in the [[Douro (wine)|Douro]] region of [[Portugal (wine)|Portugal]]. This process of [[fortification (wine)|fortification]] gave the wine [[chemical stability]] for long sea voyages and, when added during the fermentation process, left the wine with a balance of [[residual sugar]] and [[alcohol content]] that gave the wine a unique taste. This style of wine became very popular on the world wine market. Today the accepted way to make [[Port (wine)|Port]] is to \"manipulate\" it by adding [[brandy]] during the fermentation process.<ref name=\"Oxford pg 4\"/>\n\nOther winemaking techniques that have been at various times considered fraudulent or too manipulative of the wine include [[chaptalization]], fermenting and [[aging (wine)|aging]] in [[oak barrels (wine)|oak barrels]], using oak chips, stirring [[lees (wine)|lees]], [[racking]], [[clarification and filtration]], [[reverse osmosis]], cold [[maceration (wine)|maceration]], the use of cultured instead of wild yeast, [[cryo-extraction]], [[micro-oxygenation]], and the addition of [[enzyme]]s, [[anti-oxidant]] agents, [[acids (wine)|acids]] or other [[sugars (wine)|sugars]] that may be used to \"[[balance (wine)|balance]]\" the wine.<ref name=\"Oxford pg 424-425\">J. Robinson (ed) ''\"The Oxford Companion to Wine\"'' Third Edition pg 424-425 Oxford University Press 2006 {{ISBN|0-19-860990-6}}</ref>\n\n====Adding water to wine====\nWhile some winemaking techniques once considered fraudulent are now generally accepted, a few practices have gone in the opposite direction. One of the most controversial is adding water to wine in a technique known today as [[humidification]]. [[Master of wine]] [[Jancis Robinson]] calls the act of adding water to \"stretch out\" or dilute wine \"possibly the oldest form of wine fraud in the book.\"<ref name=\"Jancis\">J. Robinson ''\"[http://www.jancisrobinson.com/articles/jr437.html Adding water to wine]\"'' Purple Pages, December 31st 2002</ref> There is a long history of adding water to [[Serial dilution|dilute]] wine in order to make it more palatable. The [[ancient Greeks]] thought it was \"[[barbaric]]\" to drink [[Ancient Greece (wine)|undiluted wine]].<ref name=\"Oxford pg 4\"/> They further believed that [[wine and health|undiluted wine was unhealthy]] and that the [[Kings of Sparta|Spartan king]] [[Cleomenes I]] was once driven insane after drinking wine that was not diluted with water. Today, few consumers dilute their wine as the Greeks did, but the use of water during the winemaking process is still prevalent.<ref name=\"Oxford pg 762\">J. Robinson (ed) ''\"The Oxford Companion to Wine\"'' Third Edition pg 762 Oxford University Press 2006 {{ISBN|0-19-860990-6}}</ref>\n\nToday water is used to help balance extremely ripe grapes that would have a concentration of [[sugar (wine)|sugar]]s and [[phenolic compounds (wine)|phenolic compounds]]. Modern winemaking has begun to promote higher levels of [[ripeness (wine)|ripeness]] and longer \"hang time\" on the vine before [[harvest (wine)|harvesting]]. This increased emphasis on ripeness has had the effect of producing wines with higher [[alcohol levels]] (often over 15%). In many countries, such high alcohol levels qualify the wines for higher levels of [[duty|duties]] and [[taxes]]. Adding water to [[grape must]] can dilute the wine to such a degree that the overall [[alcohol by volume]] drops below the percentage threshold for these higher taxes.<ref name=\"Jancis\"/> The deliberate act of diluting a wine with water in order to pay lower duties and taxes is illegal in several countries.<ref name=\"Oxford pg 4\"/>\n\nThe gray area between accepted practice and fraud is where water is added to the winemaking process as a means of \"quality preservation\". Water is often used during the winemaking process to help pump grapes through equipment and to \"rehydrate\" the grapes that have begun to shrivel from the extended hang time. This rehydration is used to help balance the wine and, it is hoped, to prevent \"[[dried fruit]]\" flavors that may be unpalatable to the consumer. In the [[United States (wine)|United States]], the [[California Wine Institute]] has developed guidelines that allow for the addition of a certain amount of water to compensate for the loss of natural water in the vineyard from [[dehydration]]. The addition of water has been argued by its proponents as necessary to prevent [[stuck fermentation]]s. Despite being allowed limited legal use, the practice of adding water to wine is still shrouded in controversy, and few winemakers willingly admit to it.<ref name=\"Jancis\"/> A \"[[code word]]\" for the practice in the wine industry is adding \"[[Jesus]] units\" in a play on words about the [[Biblical]] story of the [[miracle]] performed at the [[Marriage at Cana]] where Jesus turned water into wine.<ref>J.

This practice became particularly prominent following the devastation of the [[phylloxera]] epidemic in the 19th century when the supply of expensive premium wine was scarce. At first, the label fraud mostly consisted of taking a wine from a region of lesser acclaim (such as [[Southwest France (wine)|Southwest France]] or [[Calabria (wine)|Calabria]] in Italy) and then labeling the wine as if it came from more prestigious regions such as Bordeaux or [[Tuscany (wine)|Tuscany]]. To counter this type of fraud, governments developed extensive [[appellation]] systems and [[Protected Designation of Origin]] or (PDOs) that attempted to regulate wines labeled as coming from particular wine regions. Early attempts to protect the name of a wine region led to government declaration on the boundaries and wine permitted to carry the names of [[Chianti (wine)|Chianti]], [[Oporto (wine)|Oporto]] and [[Tokaji]]. Today most major European [[wine producing countries]] have some appellation system of protected origins. The most well known systems include the ''[[Appellation d'origine contr\u00f4l\u00e9e]]'' (AOC) used in [[France]], the ''[[Denominazione di origine controllata]]'' (DOC) used in [[Italy]], the ''[[Denomina\u00e7\u00e3o de Origem Controlada]]'' (DOC) used in [[Portugal]], and the ''[[Denominaci\u00f3n de Origen]]'' (DO) system used in [[Spain]]. Producers who are registered in each appellation must abide by the appellation's rules, including exact percentage of grapes (often 100%) that must come from that region. Producers who fraudulently use grapes outside the region they are proclaiming on their wine labels can be caught by the appellation's authorities.<ref name=\"Oxford pg 4\"/>\n\nAs it became more difficult to fraudulently label wines with the wrong provenance, label fraud soon evolved to the pilfering of the identities of wine estates themselves. Merchants would take the bottles of lesser priced wines and label them with the names of the finest [[classified Bordeaux estates]] or [[Grand crus of Burgundy]].<ref name=\"Oxford pg 4\"/> Label fraud, to be done well, requires bottles, corks, and packaging to be similarly manipulated.<ref>{{cite web |title=Counterfeits and Other Problems |url=http://www.wine-searcher.com/fakes.lml |publisher=Wine-searcher.com}}</ref> Reporter {{Interlanguage link multi|Pierre-Marie Doutrelant|fr}} \"disclosed that many famous [[Champagne houses]], when short on stock, bought bottled but unlabeled wine from cooperatives or one of the big private-label producers in the region, then sold it as their own\".<ref name=prial>Prial, Frank.

In the 1980s and 1990s, Rodenstock hosted a series of high-profile wine tasting events of old and rare wines from his collection, including many from the 18th and 19th centuries. He invited to these tastings dignitaries, celebrities and internationally acclaimed wine writers and critics such as Jancis Robinson, [[Robert M. Parker, Jr.]] and [[Michael Broadbent]] who at the time was a director at the London [[wine auction|auction]] house [[Christie's]] and considered one of the world's foremost authorities on rare wine. At one such tasting, Rodenstock produced 125 vintages of [[Ch\u00e2teau d'Yquem]], including a very rare bottle from the 1784 vintage. In addition to holding these extravagant tastings, Rodenstock also sold many bottles from his collection at auction houses, which supposedly regularly inspect and research wines for authenticity. One such lot that Rodenstock sold were the rare \"[[Jefferson bottles]]\", reportedly rare Bordeaux wines bottled for the [[American president]], [[Thomas Jefferson]]. American businessman [[Bill Koch (businessman)|Bill Koch]] bought four of these Jefferson bottles which were later determined to be fake - the engravings on the bottle that purportedly linked them to Jefferson were determined to have been done with a high-speed electric drill similar to a dentist's drill; technology that did not exist until modern times. This revelation cast a net of suspicion on the authenticity of all the rare bottles that Rodenstock served at his tastings and sold at auctions.<ref name=\"New Yorker\">P.

In 2000, [[Italy|Italian]] authorities uncovered a warehouse with nearly twenty thousand bottles of fake \"[[Super Tuscan]]\" 1995 [[Sassicaia]] and arrested a number of people including the group's salesperson, who was selling the fake wine out of the back of a [[Peugeot]] [[hatchback]].<ref name=\"Spectator pg 14\"/>\n\n===Preventive actions===\nFederal governments and individual producers have taken many efforts in order to curb the prevalence of wine fraud. One of the earliest such preventive measures was the founding of the ''Service de la R\u00e9pression des Fraudes'' by the French government to detect and stamp out fraud among France's AOC wines.<ref name=\"Oxford pg 4\"/>\nSome major producers are taking actions to prevent fraud of future vintages including marking bottles with engraved [[serial number]]s on the glass and taking more control of the distribution process of their wines. However, for older vintages, the threat of fraud persists, although new techniques, like [http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jf071211r stable isotope analysis] and [[isoscapes]] are likely to grow in importance.\n\n==Wine blending==\n[[File:Sangiovese grapes for chianti.jpg|thumb|The rumors that grapes other than [[Sangiovese]] ''(pictured)'' was being used in the production of [[Brunello di Montalcino]] triggered an investigation into the potential wine fraud.]]\n\nSome practices of manipulation and adulteration have gone through stages of being considered fraudulent and later accepted{{By whom|date=June 2012}} as common practice. One of these is the practice of blending other grape varieties in order to add a characteristic that is lacking in the original wine. This most often occurred in the case of a wine lacking color. A wine with a deep dark color is often associated with being of a higher quality, so blending a darker color variety (or a [[teinturier]]) into a lighter wine could enhance the marketability of the wine. Today the practice of blending grape varieties together is commonly accepted (such as blending [[Cabernet Sauvignon]] and [[Merlot]]), except where such blending is against the regulation of a particular [[appellation]] (such as the controversy over the ''[[Brunellopoli]]'' scandal in [[Brunello di Montalcino]]).<ref name=\"Oxford pg 4\"/>\n\nThe gray area comes when inferior wine is being blended in with more expensive, higher quality wine in order to increase the total quantity of wine available to be sold at higher prices. This is a process known as \"stretching\" or \"cutting in\" the wine. During the 18th century, [[Bordeaux wine]] producers would often import wine from [[Spain (wine)|Spain]], [[Rhone (wine)|Rhone]] or the [[Languedoc (wine)|Languedoc]] to blend and stretch out their wine which they sold to the [[English (people)|English]] as [[claret]]. While this practice would be frowned upon today by Bordeaux authorities, the French wine writer [[Andr\u00e9 Jullien]] noted that some merchants believed this practice was necessary in order for the claret to be agreeable with English tastes\u2014a practice he describes as ''\"travail \u00e0 l'anglaise\"''.<ref name=\"Oxford pg 4\"/>\n\n===Examples of illegal blending===\nReporter Doutrelant reported the comments of \"a government inspector on the illegal use of sugar to boost the alcoholic content of [[Beaujolais-Villages (wine)|Beaujolais-Villages]]: 'If the law had been enforced in 1973 and 1974, at least a thousand producers would have been put out of business'\".<ref name=prial/> The same writer explained how growers \"planted [[Mourv\u00e8dre]] and [[Syrah]], two low-yield grapes that give the wine finesse, strictly for the benefit of the government inspectors.

Government authorities, such as the [[European Union]] and the American [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|Food and Drug Administration]], across the globe have set up laws and regulations of acceptable chemicals that can be added to wine in order to avoid some of the scandals that have plagued certain wine producing countries in the 20th century.<ref name=\"Oxford pg 4\"/>\n\nIn 1985, [[1985 diethylene glycol wine scandal|diethylene glycol was added as an adulterant]] by some [[Austrian (wine)|Austrian]] producers of white wines to make them [[sweetness of wine|sweeter]] and upgrade the dry wines to sweet wines; production of sweet wines is expensive and addition of sugar is easy to detect.

This may include colouring agents such as [[elderberry]] juice, and flavourings such as [[cinnamon]] at best, or less desirable additives at worst. Some varieties of wine have sought after characteristics.

In [[ancient Rome]], [[Pliny the Elder]] complained about the abundance of fraudulent [[Roman wine]] which was so great that even the [[patrician (ancient Rome)|nobility]] could not be assured that the wine they were pouring on their table was genuine. For the poor and middle class of Rome, local bar establishments seemed to have an unlimited supply of the prestigious [[Falernian wine]] for unusually low prices.<ref name=\"Oxford pg 4\">J. Robinson (ed) ''\"The Oxford Companion to Wine\"'' Third Edition pg 4 & 26-27 Oxford University Press 2006 {{ISBN|0-19-860990-6}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Middle Ages]], wines from questionable origins were often passed off as wines from more prestigious regions. In [[London]], local authorities established laws for tavern owners prohibiting [[French (wine)|French]], [[Spanish (wine)|Spanish]], and [[German wines]] from being [[cellared (wine)|cellared]] together so as to prevent the potential for mixing the wines or falsely representing them to the consumer. If a producer or merchant was found selling fraudulent or \"corrupt wine\", they were forced to drink all of it. In medieval Germany, the penalty for selling fraudulent wine ranged from [[human branding|branding]] to [[assault|beating]] to [[death penalty|death]] by [[hanging]].<ref name=\"Oxford pg 4\"/>\n\nDuring the [[Age of Enlightenment]], advancements in science ushered in a new occupation of \"wine doctors\" who could fashion examples of wines from obscure items and chemicals. Writers like [[Joseph Addison]] wrote of this \"fraternity of chymical operators (sic)\" who would use [[apples]] to make [[Champagne (wine)|Champagne]] and [[sloe]] to make [[Bordeaux (wine)|Bordeaux]] and then sell these wines fraudulently on the market. Following the [[Phylloxera epidemic]], when true wine was scarce, wine fraud rose. Some merchants would take dried raisins grown from other [[Vitis|species of grapevines]] and make wine that they passed off as being from a more prestigious [[provenance]] such as the more well known wines from [[France (wine)|France]] or [[Italy (wine)|Italy]].<ref name=\"Oxford pg 4\"/>\n\nIn the early 19th century, several European writers wrote about the risk and prevalence of wine fraud. In 1820, German chemist [[Friedrich Accum]] noted that wine was one of the commodities most at risk for being fraudulently manipulated and misrepresented. In 1833, the British wine writer [[Cyrus Redding]] echoed the alarm over the unchecked operations of these \"wine doctors\". Eventually the concern over wine fraud grew enough that provisions against the adulteration and misrepresentation of wine was included in [[British Parliament]]'s [[Adulteration of Food and Drink Act 1860]]. Several European governments also enacted legislation defining what exactly constitutes \"wine\" so as to distinguish authentic winemaking from the workings of these wine counterfeiters. The French government first legally defined wine as the product of fermented grape juice in 1889, followed by the German government in 1892 (later expanded in 1909) and the Italian government in 1904.<ref name=\"Oxford pg 4\"/>\n\nFraud of a different nature occurred during [[prohibition in the United States]], when wine production was illegal, as grape merchants would sell \"bricks\" of grape [[concentrate]] across the United States along with a packet of [[yeast (wine)|dried yeast]].<ref name=\"Oxford pg 4\"/> The bricks would come with a \"[[warning label]]\" cautioning people not to mix the contents of the brick, yeast, water, and sugar in a pot and then seal such pot for seven days, or else \"an illegal alcoholic beverage will result\".<ref name=\"MacNeil pg 630-631\">K. MacNeil ''The Wine Bible'' pg 630-631 Workman Publishing 2001 {{ISBN|1-56305-434-5}}</ref>\n\n===Practices that were once considered fraudulent===\nThe practice of adding grape spirits to wine was once considered manipulative and fraudulent but today is accepted practice for the production of all fortified wines, like [[Portwine|Port]].\n\nOver the years, [[winemaking]] techniques have evolved. The first, primitive \"[[natural wine]]\" or \"authentic wine\" was most likely the result of crushed grapes being forgotten while stored in a container. The process of allowing wild [[yeast]] found on the surface of the grape conduct [[fermentation (wine)|fermentation]] in an uncontrolled environment creates a very crude style of wine that may not be palatable to many people. Hence the development of various techniques and practices designed to improve the quality of the wine but which could be viewed as \"manipulating\" or \"adulterating\" the wine from its natural or \"authentic state\". At various points in history, these techniques may be considered \u201ctoo much\u201d manipulation, more than what a consumer would likely expect, and thus labeled as \"fraud\". However as these techniques became more common place in the wine industry, they gained an air of acceptability and eventually became just another tool in the winemaker's tool box to help craft good-quality wine.<ref name=\"Bird pgs 1-7, 223-233\">D. Bird ''Understanding Wine Technology'' pgs 1-7, 223-233 DBQA Publishing 2005 {{ISBN|1-891267-91-4}}</ref>\n\nMost techniques of manipulation arose from need. Early wine had many [[wine faults]] that caused a wine to spoil quickly. Classical writings from the Greeks and Romans detailed recipes that could cure \"sick wines\". These include adding various items like [[milk]], ground [[Mustard seed|mustard]], [[wood ash|ashes]], [[Urtica|nettles]], and [[lead]]. Another example of early \"manipulation\" that became accepted, common practice was the process of adding [[grape spirit]] to wine made in the [[Douro (wine)|Douro]] region of [[Portugal (wine)|Portugal]]. This process of [[fortification (wine)|fortification]] gave the wine [[chemical stability]] for long sea voyages and, when added during the fermentation process, left the wine with a balance of [[residual sugar]] and [[alcohol content]] that gave the wine a unique taste. This style of wine became very popular on the world wine market. Today the accepted way to make [[Port (wine)|Port]] is to \"manipulate\" it by adding [[brandy]] during the fermentation process.<ref name=\"Oxford pg 4\"/>\n\nOther winemaking techniques that have been at various times considered fraudulent or too manipulative of the wine include [[chaptalization]], fermenting and [[aging (wine)|aging]] in [[oak barrels (wine)|oak barrels]], using oak chips, stirring [[lees (wine)|lees]], [[racking]], [[clarification and filtration]], [[reverse osmosis]], cold [[maceration (wine)|maceration]], the use of cultured instead of wild yeast, [[cryo-extraction]], [[micro-oxygenation]], and the addition of [[enzyme]]s, [[anti-oxidant]] agents, [[acids (wine)|acids]] or other [[sugars (wine)|sugars]] that may be used to \"[[balance (wine)|balance]]\" the wine.<ref name=\"Oxford pg 424-425\">J. Robinson (ed) ''\"The Oxford Companion to Wine\"'' Third Edition pg 424-425 Oxford University Press 2006 {{ISBN|0-19-860990-6}}</ref>\n\n====Adding water to wine====\nWhile some winemaking techniques once considered fraudulent are now generally accepted, a few practices have gone in the opposite direction. One of the most controversial is adding water to wine in a technique known today as [[humidification]]. [[Master of wine]] [[Jancis Robinson]] calls the act of adding water to \"stretch out\" or dilute wine \"possibly the oldest form of wine fraud in the book.\"<ref name=\"Jancis\">J. Robinson ''\"[http://www.jancisrobinson.com/articles/jr437.html Adding water to wine]\"'' Purple Pages, December 31st 2002</ref> There is a long history of adding water to [[Serial dilution|dilute]] wine in order to make it more palatable. The [[ancient Greeks]] thought it was \"[[barbaric]]\" to drink [[Ancient Greece (wine)|undiluted wine]].<ref name=\"Oxford pg 4\"/> They further believed that [[wine and health|undiluted wine was unhealthy]] and that the [[Kings of Sparta|Spartan king]] [[Cleomenes I]] was once driven insane after drinking wine that was not diluted with water. Today, few consumers dilute their wine as the Greeks did, but the use of water during the winemaking process is still prevalent.<ref name=\"Oxford pg 762\">J. Robinson (ed) ''\"The Oxford Companion to Wine\"'' Third Edition pg 762 Oxford University Press 2006 {{ISBN|0-19-860990-6}}</ref>\n\nToday water is used to help balance extremely ripe grapes that would have a concentration of [[sugar (wine)|sugar]]s and [[phenolic compounds (wine)|phenolic compounds]]. Modern winemaking has begun to promote higher levels of [[ripeness (wine)|ripeness]] and longer \"hang time\" on the vine before [[harvest (wine)|harvesting]]. This increased emphasis on ripeness has had the effect of producing wines with higher [[alcohol levels]] (often over 15%). In many countries, such high alcohol levels qualify the wines for higher levels of [[duty|duties]] and [[taxes]]. Adding water to [[grape must]] can dilute the wine to such a degree that the overall [[alcohol by volume]] drops below the percentage threshold for these higher taxes.<ref name=\"Jancis\"/> The deliberate act of diluting a wine with water in order to pay lower duties and taxes is illegal in several countries.<ref name=\"Oxford pg 4\"/>\n\nThe gray area between accepted practice and fraud is where water is added to the winemaking process as a means of \"quality preservation\". Water is often used during the winemaking process to help pump grapes through equipment and to \"rehydrate\" the grapes that have begun to shrivel from the extended hang time. This rehydration is used to help balance the wine and, it is hoped, to prevent \"[[dried fruit]]\" flavors that may be unpalatable to the consumer. In the [[United States (wine)|United States]], the [[California Wine Institute]] has developed guidelines that allow for the addition of a certain amount of water to compensate for the loss of natural water in the vineyard from [[dehydration]]. The addition of water has been argued by its proponents as necessary to prevent [[stuck fermentation]]s. Despite being allowed limited legal use, the practice of adding water to wine is still shrouded in controversy, and few winemakers willingly admit to it.<ref name=\"Jancis\"/> A \"[[code word]]\" for the practice in the wine industry is adding \"[[Jesus]] units\" in a play on words about the [[Biblical]] story of the [[miracle]] performed at the [[Marriage at Cana]] where Jesus turned water into wine.<ref>J.

This practice became particularly prominent following the devastation of the [[phylloxera]] epidemic in the 19th century when the supply of expensive premium wine was scarce. At first, the label fraud mostly consisted of taking a wine from a region of lesser acclaim (such as [[Southwest France (wine)|Southwest France]] or [[Calabria (wine)|Calabria]] in Italy) and then labeling the wine as if it came from more prestigious regions such as Bordeaux or [[Tuscany (wine)|Tuscany]]. To counter this type of fraud, governments developed extensive [[appellation]] systems and [[Protected Designation of Origin]] or (PDOs) that attempted to regulate wines labeled as coming from particular wine regions. Early attempts to protect the name of a wine region led to government declaration on the boundaries and wine permitted to carry the names of [[Chianti (wine)|Chianti]], [[Oporto (wine)|Oporto]] and [[Tokaji]]. Today most major European [[wine producing countries]] have some appellation system of protected origins. The most well known systems include the ''[[Appellation d'origine contr\u00f4l\u00e9e]]'' (AOC) used in [[France]], the ''[[Denominazione di origine controllata]]'' (DOC) used in [[Italy]], the ''[[Denomina\u00e7\u00e3o de Origem Controlada]]'' (DOC) used in [[Portugal]], and the ''[[Denominaci\u00f3n de Origen]]'' (DO) system used in [[Spain]]. Producers who are registered in each appellation must abide by the appellation's rules, including exact percentage of grapes (often 100%) that must come from that region. Producers who fraudulently use grapes outside the region they are proclaiming on their wine labels can be caught by the appellation's authorities.<ref name=\"Oxford pg 4\"/>\n\nAs it became more difficult to fraudulently label wines with the wrong provenance, label fraud soon evolved to the pilfering of the identities of wine estates themselves. Merchants would take the bottles of lesser priced wines and label them with the names of the finest [[classified Bordeaux estates]] or [[Grand crus of Burgundy]].<ref name=\"Oxford pg 4\"/> Label fraud, to be done well, requires bottles, corks, and packaging to be similarly manipulated.<ref>{{cite web |title=Counterfeits and Other Problems |url=http://www.wine-searcher.com/fakes.lml |publisher=Wine-searcher.com}}</ref> Reporter {{Interlanguage link multi|Pierre-Marie Doutrelant|fr}} \"disclosed that many famous [[Champagne houses]], when short on stock, bought bottled but unlabeled wine from cooperatives or one of the big private-label producers in the region, then sold it as their own\".<ref name=prial>Prial, Frank.

In the 1980s and 1990s, Rodenstock hosted a series of high-profile wine tasting events of old and rare wines from his collection, including many from the 18th and 19th centuries. He invited to these tastings dignitaries, celebrities and internationally acclaimed wine writers and critics such as Jancis Robinson, [[Robert M. Parker, Jr.]] and [[Michael Broadbent]] who at the time was a director at the London [[wine auction|auction]] house [[Christie's]] and considered one of the world's foremost authorities on rare wine. At one such tasting, Rodenstock produced 125 vintages of [[Ch\u00e2teau d'Yquem]], including a very rare bottle from the 1784 vintage. In addition to holding these extravagant tastings, Rodenstock also sold many bottles from his collection at auction houses, which supposedly regularly inspect and research wines for authenticity. One such lot that Rodenstock sold were the rare \"[[Jefferson bottles]]\", reportedly rare Bordeaux wines bottled for the [[American president]], [[Thomas Jefferson]]. American businessman [[Bill Koch (businessman)|Bill Koch]] bought four of these Jefferson bottles which were later determined to be fake - the engravings on the bottle that purportedly linked them to Jefferson were determined to have been done with a high-speed electric drill similar to a dentist's drill; technology that did not exist until modern times. This revelation cast a net of suspicion on the authenticity of all the rare bottles that Rodenstock served at his tastings and sold at auctions.<ref name=\"New Yorker\">P. Keefe ''[http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2007/09/03/070903fa_fact_keefe?currentPage=1 The Jefferson Bottles]'', The New Yorker pages 1-10, September 3, 2007</ref><ref name=\"Jancis 2007\">[http://www.jancisrobinson.com/articles/20070315_1 Jancisrobinson.com, March 17, 2007: Flushing out wine fraud and fakes]</ref>\n\nAnother well-publicized example of label fraud is the case of [[Rudy Kurniawan]]; he was arrested on March 8, 2012 and indicted for fraud.

In 2000, [[Italy|Italian]] authorities uncovered a warehouse with nearly twenty thousand bottles of fake \"[[Super Tuscan]]\" 1995 [[Sassicaia]] and arrested a number of people including the group's salesperson, who was selling the fake wine out of the back of a [[Peugeot]] [[hatchback]].<ref name=\"Spectator pg 14\"/>\n\n===Preventive actions===\nFederal governments and individual producers have taken many efforts in order to curb the prevalence of wine fraud. One of the earliest such preventive measures was the founding of the ''Service de la R\u00e9pression des Fraudes'' by the French government to detect and stamp out fraud among France's AOC wines.<ref name=\"Oxford pg 4\"/>\nSome major producers are taking actions to prevent fraud of future vintages including marking bottles with engraved [[serial number]]s on the glass and taking more control of the distribution process of their wines. However, for older vintages, the threat of fraud persists, although new techniques, like [http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jf071211r stable isotope analysis] and [[isoscapes]] are likely to grow in importance.\n\n==Wine blending==\n[[File:Sangiovese grapes for chianti.jpg|thumb|The rumors that grapes other than [[Sangiovese]] ''(pictured)'' was being used in the production of [[Brunello di Montalcino]] triggered an investigation into the potential wine fraud.]]\n\nSome practices of manipulation and adulteration have gone through stages of being considered fraudulent and later accepted{{By whom|date=June 2012}} as common practice. One of these is the practice of blending other grape varieties in order to add a characteristic that is lacking in the original wine. This most often occurred in the case of a wine lacking color. A wine with a deep dark color is often associated with being of a higher quality, so blending a darker color variety (or a [[teinturier]]) into a lighter wine could enhance the marketability of the wine. Today the practice of blending grape varieties together is commonly accepted (such as blending [[Cabernet Sauvignon]] and [[Merlot]]), except where such blending is against the regulation of a particular [[appellation]] (such as the controversy over the ''[[Brunellopoli]]'' scandal in [[Brunello di Montalcino]]).<ref name=\"Oxford pg 4\"/>\n\nThe gray area comes when inferior wine is being blended in with more expensive, higher quality wine in order to increase the total quantity of wine available to be sold at higher prices. This is a process known as \"stretching\" or \"cutting in\" the wine. During the 18th century, [[Bordeaux wine]] producers would often import wine from [[Spain (wine)|Spain]], [[Rhone (wine)|Rhone]] or the [[Languedoc (wine)|Languedoc]] to blend and stretch out their wine which they sold to the [[English (people)|English]] as [[claret]]. While this practice would be frowned upon today by Bordeaux authorities, the French wine writer [[Andr\u00e9 Jullien]] noted that some merchants believed this practice was necessary in order for the claret to be agreeable with English tastes\u2014a practice he describes as ''\"travail \u00e0 l'anglaise\"''.<ref name=\"Oxford pg 4\"/>\n\n===Examples of illegal blending===\nReporter Doutrelant reported the comments of \"a government inspector on the illegal use of sugar to boost the alcoholic content of [[Beaujolais-Villages (wine)|Beaujolais-Villages]]: 'If the law had been enforced in 1973 and 1974, at least a thousand producers would have been put out of business'\".<ref name=prial/> The same writer explained how growers \"planted [[Mourv\u00e8dre]] and [[Syrah]], two low-yield grapes that give the wine finesse, strictly for the benefit of the government inspectors. Then, when the inspectors left, they grafted cheap, high-yield vines, [[Grenache]] and [[Carignan]], back onto the vines\".<ref name=prial/>\n\nIn March 2008, allegations were made against producers of Brunello di Montalcino that there were illegally blended other types of [[grape varieties]] into wine stipulated to be of 100% [[Sangiovese]], allegedly to inflate production and increase profit, in a scandal termed \"Brunellopoli\".<ref name=vw2803>{{cite web |last= VinoWire.com |date= March 28, 2008 |url=http://vinowire.simplicissimus.it/2008/03/28/antinori-argiano-and-frescobaldi-implicated-in-brunellopoli-brunello-scandal/ |title= Antinori, Argiano, and Frescobaldi named in \"Brunellopoli\" Brunello Scandal}}</ref>\n\nMany [[Burgundy wine]] shippers have been found guilty of blending inexpensive wine with red Burgundies and exporting them at exorbitant prices.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} The Vins [[Georges Duboeuf]] company was found guilty and fined in 2006 for illegally mixing [[Gamay]] from [[Beaujolais Villages]] with [[Beaujolais Cru]] grapes from [[Brouilly]], {{Interlanguage link multi|C\u00f4te-de-brouilly|fr}} and [[Moulin-\u00e0-Vent]] in the 2005 [[vintage]].

Some chemicals may be used to mask other wine faults and unpleasant aroma. Government authorities, such as the [[European Union]] and the American [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|Food and Drug Administration]], across the globe have set up laws and regulations of acceptable chemicals that can be added to wine in order to avoid some of the scandals that have plagued certain wine producing countries in the 20th century.<ref name=\"Oxford pg 4\"/>\n\nIn 1985, [[1985 diethylene glycol wine scandal|diethylene glycol was added as an adulterant]] by some [[Austrian (wine)|Austrian]] producers of white wines to make them [[sweetness of wine|sweeter]] and upgrade the dry wines to sweet wines;{{dubious|Adulterants for sweetness|date=March 2018}} production of sweet wines is expensive and addition of sugar is easy to detect.

{"title_page": "Feminist performance art", "text_new": "{{essay-like|date=November 2017}}\nAccording to scholar Virginia Mackenny, [[performance art]] is a great tool to mold and remold gender because performance art, in most instances, includes a direct subversion to everyday conventions. MacKenny also writes that feminist performance Art had a large presence \u201cin the late '60s and early '70s in America when, in the climate of protest constituted by the civil rights movement and [[second wave feminism]].\" There are several movements that fall under the category of feminist performance art, including Feminist Postmodernism, which took place during 1960-1970 and focused on the exploitation of women's bodies as a means for profit. Similarly, the Chicanx movement emerged in East Los Angeles during the 1970s, and focused on the Vietnam war, which was considered a post-apartheid movement.<ref name=\"MacKenny\">{{cite journal|last1=MacKenny|first1=Virginia|title=Post - Apartheid Performance Art as a Site of Gender Resistance|journal=Agenda Empowering Women for Gender Equity|date=2001|volume=49|pages=15\u201324|issn=1013-0950}}</ref>\n\n== Feminist Postmodernism ==\nAs Forte writes in her analysis of feminist performance art in the 1960s and 1970s, \u201cWithin this movement, women's performance emerges as a specific strategy that allies [[postmodernism]] and [[feminism]] \u2026 women used performance as a deconstructive strategy to demonstrate the objectification of women and its results\u201d.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Forte|first1=Jeanie|title=Women's Performance Art: Feminism and Postmodernism|journal=Theatre Journal|date=1988|volume=40.2|issn=0192-2882}}</ref> Another strategy that was commonly used by feminist performance artists during the postmodernist movement was \u201cremoving of the mask,\u201d which was utilized to demonstrate the consequences of female representations in the media, on the psyche of women. MacKenny also writes about the removing of the mask within Feminist Postmodernism. She writes, \u201cThis 'masquerade' or 'masking' occurs when women play with their assigned gender roles in multiple, often contradictory ways - adopting, adapting, overlaying and subverting the hegemonic discourse in the process.\u201d\n\n== Chicanx Movement ==\nDuring the late 1960s and early 1970s in East Los Angeles, protests broke out against the [[Vietnam War]] and its disproportionate death rate of 22% Chicanx people, while the percentage of the population that Chicanx people made up only 5% of the United States entire population.\n[[Asco (art collective)]], based in [[East Los Angeles, California|East LA]] commented on the impacts of the war on [[queer]] and brown identities, as well as the tragedies that occurred in the protests discussed above due to [[police brutality]]. The collective created visual and performative art. Some of their most famous performances experiment with gender roles, for example, one male identifying artist attended a club wearing \u201cbooty shorts, pink platforms, and a shirt that said \u2018just turned 21.\u2019\u201d<ref>{{cite book|last1=Perez|first1=Laura E.|title=Chicana art: the politics of spiritual and aesthetic altarities|date=2007|publisher=Durham: Duke U|isbn=978-0-8223-8988-0|doi=10.1215/9780822389880}}</ref>\nThe group continued to make performance and visual art that engaged with concepts related to queer and [[ethnic identity]] in East LA. During this period, East LA was ghettoized through a border of highways and dilapidated conditions.\n\n== Post Apartheid Movement ==\nMacKenny writes about two of the major players in the Post [[Apartheid]] performance art movement in [[South Africa]]. She first writes about Carol Anne Gainer and her performance entitled 'Exposed.' MacKenny explains that Gainer disrupts and subverts the binary as she performs as both the model and artist in this performance, which works to blur the \"distinction between artist/art, artist/model, constructor/constructed, finder/found, mind/body, subject/object.\"\nThe second artist which Mackenny writes about is a [[mixed race]] artist who performs a piece called 'Span.' MacKenny asserts that the artist Tracey Rose, alludes to Western societies exploitation of people of colour in scientific study and analysis, and the \"dissection and embalming of body parts of native 'others' (the most pertinent to the South African context being Saartje Baartman, a young Khoisan woman displayed for her unique genitalia and steatopygia, or enlarged buttocks),\" through her own display of her body.<ref name=\"MacKenny\"/> Her performance exposes her naked body and is contrasted against images of \"scientific\" exploitation, which both highlights the dichotomy between these subjects and engages with Mackenny's definition of post-apartheid performance art and its political aim to blur and disrupt binary structures.\n\n=== Anti War Performance Art Movement ===\nThe sociologist Rachel V Kutz-Flamenbaum writes about two major players in the anti-war performance art movement during the George W Bush administration. Code Pink, and Raging Grannies challenge and subvert gender norms in their performances, and thus, use very similar tactics and strategies. For instance, in Code Pink, Kutz-Flamenbaum asserts that, \"the emphasis on women\u2019s role as pacifist caregivers presents a nonthreatening image of women activists.\" \n\nThe perpetuated concept of women as non threatening, relies on the audiences association of pink as a non threatening and feminized colour. Kutz-Flamenbaum argues that \"Code Pink\u2019s use of civil disobedience and aggressive trailing of public officials confound and challenge normative gender expectations of women as passive, polite, and well-behaved.\"(95)<ref name=\"Kutz-Flamenbaum\">{{cite journal|last1=Kutz-Flamenbaum|first1=Rachel V|title=Code Pink, Raging Grannies, and the Missile Dick Chicks: Feminist Performance Activism in the Contemporary Anti-War Movement|journal=NWSA Journal|date=Spring 2001|volume=19|issue=1|pages=90\u201396|issn=1040-0656}}</ref>\nKutz-Flamenbaum claims that [[Raging Grannies]] similarly use this tactic in the description of their mission statement. Kutz-Flamenbaum explains that their mission statement \"illustrates the way Raging Grannies use norm- embracing stereotypes of 'little old ladies' and 'grannies' to challenge the gendered assumptions of their audiences.\" Their conscious performance as non-threatening and nurturing women, strategically and tactfully confront issues related to war and challenge the participation of the George W Bush administration in the war. \n\n== Performance Artists ==\n\n===[[Soad Hosny]]===\n[[File:Suad Husni.jpg|thumb|Suad Husni in 1972 from her movie \"Khalli Balak Min Zoozoo\" (watch out for Zoozoo)]]\n[[Soad Hosny]] (January 26, 1943 \u2013 June 21, 2001)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.elfagr.news/2442336|title=\u0634\u0627\u0647\u062f.. \u0634\u0647\u0627\u062f\u0629 \u0645\u064a\u0644\u0627\u062f \u0633\u0639\u0627\u062f \u062d\u0633\u0646\u064a|website=\u0628\u0648\u0627\u0628\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0641\u062c\u0631|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref> is an Egyptian actress and singer named the \"Cinderella of Egyptian Cinema\".<ref name=\":03\">{{Cite web|url=https://login.colorado.idm.oclc.org/login?qurl=https://bi.gale.com%2fglobal%2farticle%2fGALE%257CA569882059%3fu%3dcoloboulder%26sid%3dsummon|title=Shibboleth Authentication Request|website=login.colorado.idm.oclc.org|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref> In her 32 year long career, Hosny preformed in more than [[Soad Hosny filmography|83 films]] and a single TV series called \"Hekayat Hwa we Heya\".<ref name=\":12\">{{Cite web|url=https://https//elcinema.com/en/person/1097577|title=Soad Hosny - Actor Filmography\u060c photos\u060c Video|website=elCinema.com|language=en|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref><ref name=\":03\" />\n\n==== Feminist works ====\n\n===== \"Lilregal Faqat\" =====\nIn 1964, she and [[Nadia Lutfi]] acted in the movie \"Lilregal Faqat\" (For Men Only), which discusses woman's ability to take on jobs that are stereotypically masculine.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Allam|first=Nermin|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pck-DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA43&lpg=PA43&dq=feminist+film+%22+lel+regal+fakat%22&source=bl&ots=j-t04-XqFe&sig=ACfU3U34aedePx32Yscd_egNBCUbmDn4og&hl=ar&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj4xZqBuOToAhVYnp4KHburC60Q6AEwAXoECAsQLQ#v=onepage&q=feminist%20film%20%22%20lel%20regal%20fakat%22&f=false|title=Women and the Egyptian Revolution: Engagement and Activism during the 2011 Arab Uprisings|date=2018|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-108-42190-4|language=en}}</ref> In the movie, Soad and Nadia play the roles of two lab workers who report oil-wills locations based on samples they get from the desert.

In the early 1990s, Kahlo had become a recognized figure in art history, but also regarded as an icon for [[Chicano Movement|Chicana/os]], the [[Latinx]]<nowiki/>community, the [[feminism]]<nowiki/>movement, and the [[LGBTQ+]]<nowiki/>movement.

Her understanding and visions of being, living with the disabilities she suffered from a trolley accident in her younger years resonate with those also afflicted with disabilities.

During their courtship the couple manipulated the press attention directed on them by documenting their relationship through performance art.<ref name=\":0\">Elizabeth Ann Lindau. \u201cMother Superior\u201d: Maternity and Creativity in the Work of Yoko Ono.\" ''Women and Music: A Journal of Gender and Culture'' 20 (University of Nebraska Press: 2016), 64.</ref> As Ono stated in a 1986 TV interview, \u201cwe were always together\u2026 we exchanged very fully between ourselves.\u201d<ref name=\":1\">''Yoko Ono on John Lennon's Assasination, Their Son Sean and Influencing The Beatles Breakup.'', ''YouTube'' (YouTube, 2017), <nowiki>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Suj8MCysBKQ</nowiki>)</ref> They emphasized this unusual situation, where the husband and wife worked together rather than the pair working separately outside the home, through their performance art \u201cBed-ins.\u201d<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAs an interracial couple they also challenged racial stereotypes. She confessed, \u201cI think it was a big lesson for the world that we were together\u2026 And I think it might have helped too for people to understand what it means to confront the interracial couple.\u201d<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nParenthood is a factor in the controversy surrounding Ono. Women were not usually part of performance art or rock music, and mothers in particular were antithetical to everything rock stood for. The public idea of rock music as youthful male rebellion placed mothers as the opponent. When Ono and Lennon began their relationship, Beatles fans saw this female influence as an intrusion and the force that broke up their favorite band. However, as Ono saw it, the [[The Beatles|Beatles]] grew apart naturally and she was not the primary cause.<ref name=\":1\" /> Public confusion was exacerbated with Ono\u2019s pregnancy. While pregnant with their son Sean, Ono announced to Lennon: \u201cI am carrying the baby nine months and that is enough. You take care of it afterwards.\u201d<ref name=\":0\" /> After Sean\u2019s birth, she ran the couple\u2019s business while Lennon stayed home as \u201chousehusband.\u201d<ref name=\":0\" /> Ono\u2019s hands off approach to parenting is a source of controversy because she was simultaneously too motherly and not motherly enough.\n\n=== Work ===\nOne of her early works is [[Cut Piece]], first performed in 1964 at the Yamaichi Concert Hall in Kyoto. She kneeled on the stage in her best suit and invited audience members to use scissors to cut it off of her. Confronting issues of gender, class and cultural identity, Ono sat silently until the piece concluded at her discretion.<ref>Munroe, Alexandra; Ono, Yoko; Hendricks, Jon; Altshuler, Bruce; Ross, David A.; Wenner, Jann S.; Concannon, Kevin C.; Tomii, Reiko; Sayle, Murray; Gomez, Edward M.

The book reads like an instruction manual for the reader to create their own versions of her pieces either physically or in the imagination. Over the nearly 60 years that she has been active, Ono has created installations of modern art across the globe, recorded numerous original songs both with John Lennon and the [[Plastic Ono Band]], as well as individually, and continues in activism to this day.\n\n== Orlan==\nORLAN (born as Mireille Suzanne Francette Porte) is French performance artist, most known for her radical use of plastic surgery to form her work. She uses her face and body as a malleable tool to change her appearance and therefore change her art. She primarily used plastic surgery to morph and change her body in her theatrical expression. Orlan uses her body at the heart of her expression, to articulate her political, social and cultural beliefs. Due to suffering an ectopic pregnancy, she felt her body was changed dramatically, and through that, she chose to turn her body into artwork through the use of plastic surgery.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.artnet.com/artists/orlan/|title=ORLAN {{!}} artnet|website=www.artnet.com|access-date=2020-04-02}}</ref>\n\nOne of her most notable performances was that of the 1977 International Contemporary Art Fair in Paris.

Similarly, the Chicanx movement emerged in East Los Angeles during the 1970s, and focused on the Vietnam war, which was considered a post-apartheid movement.<ref name=\"MacKenny\">{{cite journal|last1=MacKenny|first1=Virginia|title=Post - Apartheid Performance Art as a Site of Gender Resistance|journal=Agenda Empowering Women for Gender Equity|date=2001|volume=49|pages=15\u201324|issn=1013-0950}}</ref>\n\n== Feminist Postmodernism ==\nAs Forte writes in her analysis of feminist performance art in the 1960s and 1970s, \u201cWithin this movement, women's performance emerges as a specific strategy that allies [[postmodernism]] and [[feminism]] \u2026 women used performance as a deconstructive strategy to demonstrate the objectification of women and its results\u201d.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Forte|first1=Jeanie|title=Women's Performance Art: Feminism and Postmodernism|journal=Theatre Journal|date=1988|volume=40.2|issn=0192-2882}}</ref> Another strategy that was commonly used by feminist performance artists during the postmodernist movement was \u201cremoving of the mask,\u201d which was utilized to demonstrate the consequences of female representations in the media, on the psyche of women. MacKenny also writes about the removing of the mask within Feminist Postmodernism. She writes, \u201cThis 'masquerade' or 'masking' occurs when women play with their assigned gender roles in multiple, often contradictory ways - adopting, adapting, overlaying and subverting the hegemonic discourse in the process.\u201d\n\n== Chicanx Movement ==\nDuring the late 1960s and early 1970s in East Los Angeles, protests broke out against the [[Vietnam War]] and its disproportionate death rate of 22% Chicanx people, while the percentage of the population that Chicanx people made up only 5% of the United States entire population.\n[[Asco (art collective)]], based in [[East Los Angeles, California|East LA]] commented on the impacts of the war on [[queer]] and brown identities, as well as the tragedies that occurred in the protests discussed above due to [[police brutality]]. The collective created visual and performative art. Some of their most famous performances experiment with gender roles, for example, one male identifying artist attended a club wearing \u201cbooty shorts, pink platforms, and a shirt that said \u2018just turned 21.\u2019\u201d<ref>{{cite book|last1=Perez|first1=Laura E.|title=Chicana art: the politics of spiritual and aesthetic altarities|date=2007|publisher=Durham: Duke U|isbn=978-0-8223-8988-0|doi=10.1215/9780822389880}}</ref>\nThe group continued to make performance and visual art that engaged with concepts related to queer and [[ethnic identity]] in East LA. During this period, East LA was ghettoized through a border of highways and dilapidated conditions.\n\n== Post Apartheid Movement ==\nMacKenny writes about two of the major players in the Post [[Apartheid]] performance art movement in [[South Africa]]. She first writes about Carol Anne Gainer and her performance entitled 'Exposed.' MacKenny explains that Gainer disrupts and subverts the binary as she performs as both the model and artist in this performance, which works to blur the \"distinction between artist/art, artist/model, constructor/constructed, finder/found, mind/body, subject/object.\"\nThe second artist which Mackenny writes about is a [[mixed race]] artist who performs a piece called 'Span.' MacKenny asserts that the artist Tracey Rose, alludes to Western societies exploitation of people of colour in scientific study and analysis, and the \"dissection and embalming of body parts of native 'others' (the most pertinent to the South African context being Saartje Baartman, a young Khoisan woman displayed for her unique genitalia and steatopygia, or enlarged buttocks),\" through her own display of her body.<ref name=\"MacKenny\"/> Her performance exposes her naked body and is contrasted against images of \"scientific\" exploitation, which both highlights the dichotomy between these subjects and engages with Mackenny's definition of post-apartheid performance art and its political aim to blur and disrupt binary structures.\n\n=== Anti War Performance Art Movement ===\nThe sociologist Rachel V Kutz-Flamenbaum writes about two major players in the anti-war performance art movement during the George W Bush administration. Code Pink, and Raging Grannies challenge and subvert gender norms in their performances, and thus, use very similar tactics and strategies. For instance, in Code Pink, Kutz-Flamenbaum asserts that, \"the emphasis on women\u2019s role as pacifist caregivers presents a nonthreatening image of women activists.\" \n\nThe perpetuated concept of women as non threatening, relies on the audiences association of pink as a non threatening and feminized colour. Kutz-Flamenbaum argues that \"Code Pink\u2019s use of civil disobedience and aggressive trailing of public officials confound and challenge normative gender expectations of women as passive, polite, and well-behaved.\"(95)<ref name=\"Kutz-Flamenbaum\">{{cite journal|last1=Kutz-Flamenbaum|first1=Rachel V|title=Code Pink, Raging Grannies, and the Missile Dick Chicks: Feminist Performance Activism in the Contemporary Anti-War Movement|journal=NWSA Journal|date=Spring 2001|volume=19|issue=1|pages=90\u201396|issn=1040-0656}}</ref>\nKutz-Flamenbaum claims that [[Raging Grannies]] similarly use this tactic in the description of their mission statement. Kutz-Flamenbaum explains that their mission statement \"illustrates the way Raging Grannies use norm- embracing stereotypes of 'little old ladies' and 'grannies' to challenge the gendered assumptions of their audiences.\" Their conscious performance as non-threatening and nurturing women, strategically and tactfully confront issues related to war and challenge the participation of the George W Bush administration in the war. \n\n== Performance Artists ==\n\n===[[Soad Hosny]]===\n[[File:Suad Husni.jpg|thumb|Suad Husni in 1972 from her movie \"Khalli Balak Min Zoozoo\" (watch out for Zoozoo)]]\n[[Soad Hosny]] (January 26, 1943 \u2013 June 21, 2001)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.elfagr.news/2442336|title=\u0634\u0627\u0647\u062f.. \u0634\u0647\u0627\u062f\u0629 \u0645\u064a\u0644\u0627\u062f \u0633\u0639\u0627\u062f \u062d\u0633\u0646\u064a|website=\u0628\u0648\u0627\u0628\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0641\u062c\u0631|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref> is an Egyptian actress and singer named the \"Cinderella of Egyptian Cinema\".<ref name=\":03\">{{Cite web|url=https://login.colorado.idm.oclc.org/login?qurl=https://bi.gale.com%2fglobal%2farticle%2fGALE%257CA569882059%3fu%3dcoloboulder%26sid%3dsummon|title=Shibboleth Authentication Request|website=login.colorado.idm.oclc.org|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref> In her 32 year long career, Hosny preformed in more than [[Soad Hosny filmography|83 films]] and a single TV series called \"Hekayat Hwa we Heya\".<ref name=\":12\">{{Cite web|url=https://https//elcinema.com/en/person/1097577|title=Soad Hosny - Actor Filmography\u060c photos\u060c Video|website=elCinema.com|language=en|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref><ref name=\":03\" />\n\n==== Feminist works ====\n\n===== \"Lilregal Faqat\" =====\nIn 1964, she and [[Nadia Lutfi]] acted in the movie \"Lilregal Faqat\" (For Men Only), which discusses woman's ability to take on jobs that are stereotypically masculine.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Allam|first=Nermin|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pck-DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA43&lpg=PA43&dq=feminist+film+%22+lel+regal+fakat%22&source=bl&ots=j-t04-XqFe&sig=ACfU3U34aedePx32Yscd_egNBCUbmDn4og&hl=ar&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj4xZqBuOToAhVYnp4KHburC60Q6AEwAXoECAsQLQ#v=onepage&q=feminist%20film%20%22%20lel%20regal%20fakat%22&f=false|title=Women and the Egyptian Revolution: Engagement and Activism during the 2011 Arab Uprisings|date=2018|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-108-42190-4|language=en}}</ref> In the movie, Soad and Nadia play the roles of two lab workers who report oil-wills locations based on samples they get from the desert.

In the early 1990s, Kahlo had become a recognized figure in art history, but also regarded as an icon for [[Chicano Movement|Chicana/os]], the [[Latinx]]<nowiki/>community, the [[feminism]]<nowiki/>movement, and the [[LGBTQ+]]<nowiki/>movement.

During their courtship the couple manipulated the press attention directed on them by documenting their relationship through performance art.<ref name=\":0\">Elizabeth Ann Lindau. \u201cMother Superior\u201d: Maternity and Creativity in the Work of Yoko Ono.\" ''Women and Music: A Journal of Gender and Culture'' 20 (University of Nebraska Press: 2016), 64.</ref> As Ono stated in a 1986 TV interview, \u201cwe were always together\u2026 we exchanged very fully between ourselves.\u201d<ref name=\":1\">''Yoko Ono on John Lennon's Assasination, Their Son Sean and Influencing The Beatles Breakup.'', ''YouTube'' (YouTube, 2017), <nowiki>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Suj8MCysBKQ</nowiki>)</ref> They emphasized this unusual situation, where the husband and wife worked together rather than the pair working separately outside the home, through their performance art \u201cBed-ins.\u201d<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAs an interracial couple they also challenged racial stereotypes. She confessed, \u201cI think it was a big lesson for the world that we were together\u2026 And I think it might have helped too for people to understand what it means to confront the interracial couple.\u201d<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nParenthood is a factor in the controversy surrounding Ono. Women were not usually part of performance art or rock music, and mothers in particular were antithetical to everything rock stood for. The public idea of rock music as youthful male rebellion placed mothers as the opponent. When Ono and Lennon began their relationship, Beatles fans saw this female influence as an intrusion and the force that broke up their favorite band. However, as Ono saw it, the [[The Beatles|Beatles]] grew apart naturally and she was not the primary cause.<ref name=\":1\" /> Public confusion was exacerbated with Ono\u2019s pregnancy. While pregnant with their son Sean, Ono announced to Lennon: \u201cI am carrying the baby nine months and that is enough.

The book reads like an instruction manual for the reader to create their own versions of her pieces either physically or in the imagination.

She uses her face and body as a malleable tool to change her appearance and therefore change her art. She primarily used plastic surgery to morph and change her body in her theatrical expression. Orlan uses her body at the heart of her expression, to articulate her political, social and cultural beliefs. Due to suffering an ectopic pregnancy, she felt her body was changed dramatically, and through that, she chose to turn her body into artwork through the use of plastic surgery.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.artnet.com/artists/orlan/|title=ORLAN {{!}} artnet|website=www.artnet.com|access-date=2020-04-02}}</ref>\n\nOne of her most notable performances was that of the 1977 International Contemporary Art Fair in Paris.

In particular, he burned almost all the Mayan manuscripts ([[Maya codices|codices]]) that would have been very useful in deciphering [[Maya script|Mayan script]], knowledge of Maya religion and civilization, and the history of the American continent.\n\n==Conversion of Maya==\nBorn in [[Cifuentes, Guadalajara|Cifuentes]], [[Guadalajara, Spain]], he became a Franciscan friar in 1541, and was sent as one of the first Franciscans to the Yucat\u00e1n, arriving in 1549. Landa was in charge of bringing the [[Roman Catholic]] faith to the [[Maya peoples]] after the [[Spanish conquest of Yucat\u00e1n]]. He presided over a spiritual monopoly granted to the Catholic [[Franciscan order]] by the Spanish crown, and he worked diligently to buttress the order's power and convert the indigenous Maya. His initial appointment was to the mission of San Antonio in [[Izamal]], which served also as his primary residence while in Yucat\u00e1n.\n\nHe is the author of the ''[[Relaci\u00f3n de las cosas de Yucat\u00e1n]]'' in which he catalogues the [[Maya religion]], [[Maya language]], culture and writing system. The manuscript was written around 1566 on his return to Spain; however, the original copies have long since been lost. The account is known only as an abridgement, which in turn had undergone several iterations by various copyists. The extant version was produced around 1660, lost to scholarship for over two centuries and not rediscovered until the 19th century. In 1862, French cleric [[Charles Etienne Brasseur de Bourbourg]] published the manuscript in a bilingual French-Spanish edition, ''Relation des choses de Yucat\u00e1n de Diego de Landa''.\n\n==Inquisition==\n\n===Suppression of Maya and destruction of Mayan texts===\nAfter hearing of [[Roman Catholic]] Maya who continued to practice [[idolatry|idol worship]], Landa ordered an [[Inquisition]] in [[Man\u00ed, Yucat\u00e1n|Mani]], ending with a ceremony called ''[[auto de f\u00e9]]''. During the ceremony on July 12, 1562, a disputed number of Maya [[codex|codices]] (according to Landa, 27 books) and approximately 5000 Maya [[cult image]]s were burned. \nOnly three pre-Columbian books of [[Maya hieroglyphics]] (also known as a [[codex]]) and, perhaps, fragments of a fourth are known to have survived. Collectively, the works are known as the [[Maya codices]].\n\nLanda's Inquisition showered a level of physical abuse upon the indigenous Maya that many viewed as excessive and was, at the very least, unusual. Scores of Maya nobles were jailed pending interrogation, and large numbers of Maya nobles and commoners were subjected to examination under \"[[Strappado|hoisting]].\"<ref>Clendinnen, Inga. ''Ambivalent Conquests: Maya and Spaniard in Yucatan, 1517-1570'', 2nd. ed. Cambridge: University Press, 1987</ref> During hoisting, a victim's hands were bound and looped over an extended line that was then raised until the victim's entire body was suspended in the air. Often, stone weights were added to the ankles or lashes applied to the back during interrogation.\n\nSome contemporary observers were troubled by this widespread use of torture. Crown fiat had earlier exempted indigenous peoples from the authority of the Inquisition, on the grounds that their understanding of Christianity was \"too childish\"{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} for them to be held culpable for heresies. Additionally, Landa dispensed with much of the extensive formal procedure and documentation that accompanied Spanish torture and interrogation.\n\n===Justifications===\nScholars have argued that Mexican inquisitions showed little concern to eradicate magic or convict individuals for heterodox beliefs<ref>{{Citation |last=Behar |first=Ruth |title=Sex and Sin, Witchcraft and the Devil in Late-Colonial Mexico |journal=American Ethnologist |volume=14 |year=1987 |pages=34\u201354 |doi=10.1525/ae.1987.14.1.02a00030|url=https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/2027.42/136539/1/ae.1987.14.1.02a00030.pdf }}.</ref> and that witchcraft was treated more as a religious problem capable of being resolved by confession and absolution. Landa, however, perhaps inspired by intolerant fellow Franciscan Cardenal, [[Francisco Jim\u00e9nez de Cisneros|Cisneros]], from the same Toledo convent, was \"monomaniacal in his fervor\"<ref>{{Citation |last=Schwaller |first=John Frederick |title=Introduction: Franciscans in Colonial Latin America |journal=The Americas |volume=61 |year=2005 |pages=565\u2013570 |doi=10.1353/tam.2005.0100}}.</ref> against it. Landa believed a huge underground network of apostasies,<ref name=\"Timmer\">{{Citation |last=Timmer |first=David E. |title=Providence and Perdition: Fray Diego de Landa Justifies His Inquisition against the Yucatecan Maya |journal=Church History |year=1997 |pages=477\u2013483 }}</ref> led by displaced indigenous priests, were jealous of the power the Church enjoyed and sought to reclaim it for themselves. The apostates, Landa surmised, had launched a counteroffensive against the Church, and he believed it was his duty to expose the evil before it could revert the population to their old heathen ways.\n\nLanda claimed that he had discovered evidence of [[human sacrifice]] and other idolatrous practices while rooting out native idolatry. Although one of the alleged victims of said sacrifices, Mani Encomendero Dasbat\u00e9s, was later found to be alive, and Landa's enemies contested his right to run an inquisition,<ref>Tozzer, A.M.

''The Hispanic American Historical Review'' (November, 1939): 520</ref> Landa insisted a [[papal bull]], ''[[Exponi nobis]]'', justified his actions.<ref name=\"Timmer\" />\n\nHowever, Lopez de Cogolludo, Landa's chief Franciscan biographer, wrote of Landa's firsthand experiences with human sacrifices. When Landa first came to the Yucat\u00e1n, he made it his mission to walk the breadth of the peninsula and preach to the most remote villages.<ref>{{Citation |last=Clendinnen |first=Inga |title=Ambivalent Conquests: Maya and Spaniard in Yucatan, 1517-1570 |location=New York |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2003 |edition=2nd |page=[https://archive.org/details/ambivalentconque00inga/page/67 67] |isbn=0521820316 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/ambivalentconque00inga/page/67 }}.</ref> While passing through Cupules, he came upon a group of 300 about to sacrifice a young boy. Enraged, Landa stormed through the crowd, released the boy, smashed the idols and began preaching with such zeal and sincerity that they begged him to remain in the land and teach them more.<ref>Clendinnen, 68</ref>\n\nLanda was remarkable in that he was willing to go where no others would. He entered lands that had been only recently conquered, where native resentment of Spaniards was still very intense. Armed with nothing but the conviction to learn as much of native culture as he could so that it would be easier for him to destroy it in the future,<ref>Roys, Ralph L. Review of ''Landa's Relacion De Las Cosas De Yucatan: A Translation by Alfred M. Tozzer'', by Alred M. Tozzer. ''The American Historical Review'' (October 1943): 133.</ref> Landa formulated an intimate contact with natives. Natives placed him in such an esteemed position they were willing to show him some of their sacred writings that had been transcribed on deerskin books.<ref>Clendinnen, 69-70</ref> To Landa and the other Franciscan friars, the very existence of these Mayan codices was proof of diabolical practices. In references to the books, Landa said: \n<blockquote>We found a large number of books in these characters and, as they contained nothing in which were not to be seen as superstition and lies of the devil, we burned them all, which they (the Maya) regretted to an amazing degree, and which caused them much affliction.<ref name=\"Clendinnen, 70\">Clendinnen, 70</ref></blockquote>\n\nLanda's insistence of widespread cults throughout the Yucat\u00e1n is backed by ample evidence. Rituals the Spanish conquerors could not understand were labeled as idolatry, superstition, or even devil worship. One such ritual involved clay idols that were used in a strange combination of Catholicism and indigenous religion.<ref name=\"Clendinnen, 70\"/> During the ceremonies, individuals would be crucified and then have their hearts removed from their chest and their blood smeared onto the idols. Such ceremonies were practiced throughout the Yucat\u00e1n up to 45 years after the arrival of the Spaniards.\n\nLanda always believed in his inquisition. Whether magic and idolatry were being practiced or not, Landa was almost certainly \"possessed\" by fantasies of demonic power in a new land.<ref>{{Citation |last=Tedlock |first=Dennis |year=1993 |title=Torture in the Archives: Mayans Meet Europeans |journal=American Anthropologist |volume=95 |issue=1 |pages=139\u2013152 [p. 147] |jstor=681183 |doi=10.1525/aa.1993.95.1.02a00070}}.</ref> Landa, like most other Franciscans, subscribed to millenarian ideas,<ref>Blom, Frans.

Eliminating evil and pagan practices, Landa believed, would usher the [[Second Coming of Christ]] much sooner.\n\nMany historians believe there can be little doubt old traditions would continue even during Spanish rule, and because of \"the resilience of the old social order, and the determination of its custodians to sustain the old ways, some human killings persisted into the post-conquest period....\"<ref>Clendinnen, 182</ref>\n\nWhile it was likely that Landa did coerce exaggerated confessions by torture, he believed so fully that human sacrifice was occurring around him that he was willing to kill a handful of sinners to save the overall community.<ref>Timmer, 480</ref>\n\nLanda's ''Relaci\u00f3n De Las Cosas De Yucat\u00e1n'' is about as complete a treatment of Mayan religion as is ever likely.<ref name=\"Roys, 133\">Roys, 133</ref> While controversy surrounds his use of force in the conversion process, few scholars would debate the general accuracy of his recordings.

His actions were strongly condemned before the Council of the Indies. That resulted in a \"committee of doctors\" being commissioned to investigate Landa's alleged crimes. In 1569, the committee absolved Landa of his crimes. Bishop Toral died in Mexico in 1571, allowing King [[Philip II of Spain]] to appoint Landa as the second  bishop of Yucat\u00e1n.\n\n==Landa and contemporary Mayanist studies==\n[[Image:De Landa alphabet.jpg|thumb|250px|Image of the page from ''Relaci\u00f3n de las Cosas de Yucat\u00e1n'' in which Landa describes his Maya alphabet, which was to prove instrumental in the mid-20th-century breakthrough in [[Maya hieroglyphics]] decipherment.]]Landa's ''[[Relaci\u00f3n de las cosas de Yucat\u00e1n]]'' also created a valuable record of the Mayan [[writing system]], which, despite its inaccuracies, was later to prove instrumental in the [[decipherment]] of the writing system. Landa asked his informants (his primary sources were two Maya individuals descended from a ruling Maya dynasty who were literate in the script) to write down the [[glyph]]ic symbols corresponding to each of the letters of the (Spanish) alphabet, in the belief that there ought to be a one-to-one correspondence between them. The results were faithfully reproduced by Landa in his later account, but he recognised that the set contained apparent inconsistencies and duplicates that he was unable to explain. Later researchers reviewing this material also formed the view that the \"[[de Landa alphabet]]\" was inaccurate or fanciful, and many subsequent attempts to use the transcription remained unconvincing. It was not until much later, in the mid-20th century, when it was realized and then confirmed that it was not a transcription of an ''[[alphabet]]'', as Landa and others had originally supposed, but was rather a [[syllabary]]. That was confirmed only by the work of [[Soviet]] linguist [[Yuri Knorozov]] in the 1950s and the succeeding generation of [[Mayanist]]s.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n== Sources ==\n* {{cite book\n| title=Ambivalent Conquests: Maya and Spaniard in Yucatan, 1517-1570\n| url=https://archive.org/details/ambivalentconque00inga\n| url-access=registration\n| first=Inga\n| last=Clendinnen\n| authorlink=Inga Clendinnen\n| edition=2\n| year=2003\n| publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]\n| isbn=9780521527316}}\n\n* {{cite book\n| title=An interpretation of Bishop Diego de Landa's Maya alphabet.\n| first=Marshall E.\n| last=Durbin\n| year=1969\n| publisher=Middle American Research Institute, [[Tulane University]]\n| location=New Orleans\n| OCLC=1136497}}\n\n* {{cite book\n| title=Yucatan Before and After the Conquest\n| authors=Diego de Landa, William Gates\n| publisher=[[Dover Publications]]\n| url=https://www.globalgreyebooks.com/content/books/ebooks/yucatan-before-and-after-the-conquest.pdf\n| isbn=9780486236223}}\n\n* [[Relaci\u00f3n de las cosas de Yucat\u00e1n]]\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category}}\n* [http://users.skynet.be/fa039055/lifedeat.htm Skynet.be: A biography of Diego de Landa]\n* [http://www.mesoweb.com/bearc/cmr/19.html Mesoweb.com: Research Reports on Ancient Maya Writing] \u2014 ''Glyph Drawings from Landa's Relaci\u00f3n: A Caveat to the Investigator by George Stuart, Center for Maya Research''.\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Landa Calderon, Diego de}}\n[[Category:Franciscan bishops]]\n[[Category:Historians of Mesoamerica]]\n[[Category:Mayanists]]\n[[Category:Mexican Franciscans]]\n[[Category:Novohispanic Mesoamericanists]]\n[[Category:1524 births]]\n[[Category:1579 deaths]]\n[[Category:16th-century historians]]\n[[Category:16th-century Mesoamericanists]]\n[[Category:16th-century Mexican people]]\n[[Category:16th-century Roman Catholic bishops]]\n[[Category:Colonial Mexico]]\n[[Category:Book burnings]]\n[[Category:16th century in the Maya civilization]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox Christian leader\n| type        = \n| honorific-prefix = Most Reverend\n| name        = Diego de Landa\n| title       = Bishop of Yucat\u00e1n\n| image       = Diego de Landa.jpg\n| alt         = \n| caption     = \n| church      = [[Catholic Church]]\n| archdiocese = \n| diocese     = [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Yucat\u00e1n|Diocese of Yucat\u00e1n]] \n| see         = \n| term        = \n| predecessor = [[Francisco de Toral]]\n| successor   = [[Gregorio de Montalvo Olivera]]\n<!--   Orders   -->\n| ordination     = \n| ordained_by    = \n| consecration   = 1573\n| consecrated_by = [[Crist\u00f3bal Rojas Sandoval]]\n| rank           = \n<!--   Personal details   -->\n| birth_date    = November 12, 1524\n| birth_place   = [[Cifuentes, Guadalajara|Cifuentes]], [[Alcarria]], [[Spain]]\n| death_date    = April 29, 1579\n| death_place   = Yucat\u00e1n\n| previous_post = \n| nationality   = Spanish\n}}\n'''Diego de Landa Calder\u00f3n, [[Order of Friars Minor|O.F.M.]]''' (12 November 1524 &ndash; 29 April 1579) was  a Spanish [[bishop]] of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Yucat\u00e1n]].<ref name=CathHierDiegoLanda>{{cite web|last=Cheney |first=David M.|title=Bishop Diego de Landa, O.F.M.|website=[[Catholic-Hierarchy.org]]|url=http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/bishop/bdelanda.html|accessdate=March 25, 2018}}[[Wikipedia:Verifiability#Self-published sources|{{sup|''self-published''}}]]</ref> Many historians criticize his campaign against [[idolatry]].

He presided over a spiritual monopoly granted to the Catholic [[Franciscan order]] by the Spanish crown, and he worked diligently to buttress the order's power and convert the indigenous Maya. His initial appointment was to the mission of San Antonio in [[Izamal]], which served also as his primary residence while in Yucat\u00e1n.\n\nHe is the author of the ''[[Relaci\u00f3n de las cosas de Yucat\u00e1n]]'' in which he catalogues the [[Maya religion]], [[Maya language]], culture and writing system. The manuscript was written around 1566 on his return to Spain; however, the original copies have long since been lost. The account is known only as an abridgement, which in turn had undergone several iterations by various copyists. The extant version was produced around 1660, lost to scholarship for over two centuries and not rediscovered until the 19th century. In 1862, French cleric [[Charles Etienne Brasseur de Bourbourg]] published the manuscript in a bilingual French-Spanish edition, ''Relation des choses de Yucat\u00e1n de Diego de Landa''.\n\n==Inquisition==\n\n===Suppression of Maya and destruction of all but a handful of written Mayan language documents===\nAfter hearing of [[Roman Catholic]] Maya who continued to practice [[idolatry|idol worship]], Landa ordered an [[Inquisition]] in [[Man\u00ed, Yucat\u00e1n|Mani]], ending with a ceremony called ''[[auto de f\u00e9]]''. During the ceremony on July 12, 1562, a disputed number of Maya [[codex|codices]] (according to Landa, 27 books) and approximately 5000 Maya [[cult image]]s were burned. \nOnly three pre-Columbian books of [[Maya hieroglyphics]] (also known as a [[codex]]) and, perhaps, fragments of a fourth are known to have survived. Collectively, the works are known as the [[Maya codices]].\n\nLanda's Inquisition showered a level of physical abuse upon the indigenous Maya that many viewed as excessive and was, at the very least, unusual. Scores of Maya nobles were jailed pending interrogation, and large numbers of Maya nobles and commoners were subjected to examination under \"[[Strappado|hoisting]].\"<ref>Clendinnen, Inga. ''Ambivalent Conquests: Maya and Spaniard in Yucatan, 1517-1570'', 2nd. ed. Cambridge: University Press, 1987</ref> During hoisting, a victim's hands were bound and looped over an extended line that was then raised until the victim's entire body was suspended in the air. Often, stone weights were added to the ankles or lashes applied to the back during interrogation.\n\nSome contemporary observers were troubled by this widespread use of torture. Crown fiat had earlier exempted indigenous peoples from the authority of the Inquisition, on the grounds that their understanding of Christianity was \"too childish\"{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} for them to be held culpable for heresies. Additionally, Landa dispensed with much of the extensive formal procedure and documentation that accompanied Spanish torture and interrogation.\n\n===Justifications===\nScholars have argued that Mexican inquisitions showed little concern to eradicate magic or convict individuals for heterodox beliefs<ref>{{Citation |last=Behar |first=Ruth |title=Sex and Sin, Witchcraft and the Devil in Late-Colonial Mexico |journal=American Ethnologist |volume=14 |year=1987 |pages=34\u201354 |doi=10.1525/ae.1987.14.1.02a00030|url=https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/2027.42/136539/1/ae.1987.14.1.02a00030.pdf }}.</ref> and that witchcraft was treated more as a religious problem capable of being resolved by confession and absolution. Landa, however, perhaps inspired by intolerant fellow Franciscan Cardenal, [[Francisco Jim\u00e9nez de Cisneros|Cisneros]], from the same Toledo convent, was \"monomaniacal in his fervor\"<ref>{{Citation |last=Schwaller |first=John Frederick |title=Introduction: Franciscans in Colonial Latin America |journal=The Americas |volume=61 |year=2005 |pages=565\u2013570 |doi=10.1353/tam.2005.0100}}.</ref> against it. Landa believed a huge underground network of apostasies,<ref name=\"Timmer\">{{Citation |last=Timmer |first=David E. |title=Providence and Perdition: Fray Diego de Landa Justifies His Inquisition against the Yucatecan Maya |journal=Church History |year=1997 |pages=477\u2013483 }}</ref> led by displaced indigenous priests, were jealous of the power the Church enjoyed and sought to reclaim it for themselves. The apostates, Landa surmised, had launched a counteroffensive against the Church, and he believed it was his duty to expose the evil before it could revert the population to their old heathen ways.\n\nLanda claimed that he had discovered evidence of [[human sacrifice]] and other idolatrous practices while rooting out native idolatry. Although one of the alleged victims of said sacrifices, Mani Encomendero Dasbat\u00e9s, was later found to be alive, and Landa's enemies contested his right to run an inquisition,<ref>Tozzer, A.M.

''The Hispanic American Historical Review'' (November, 1939): 520</ref> Landa insisted a [[papal bull]], ''[[Exponi nobis]]'', justified his actions.<ref name=\"Timmer\" />\n\nHowever, Lopez de Cogolludo, Landa's chief Franciscan biographer, wrote of Landa's firsthand experiences with human sacrifices. When Landa first came to the Yucat\u00e1n, he made it his mission to walk the breadth of the peninsula and preach to the most remote villages.<ref>{{Citation |last=Clendinnen |first=Inga |title=Ambivalent Conquests: Maya and Spaniard in Yucatan, 1517-1570 |location=New York |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2003 |edition=2nd |page=[https://archive.org/details/ambivalentconque00inga/page/67 67] |isbn=0521820316 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/ambivalentconque00inga/page/67 }}.</ref> While passing through Cupules, he came upon a group of 300 about to sacrifice a young boy. Enraged, Landa stormed through the crowd, released the boy, smashed the idols and began preaching with such zeal and sincerity that they begged him to remain in the land and teach them more.<ref>Clendinnen, 68</ref>\n\nLanda was remarkable in that he was willing to go where no others would. He entered lands that had been only recently conquered, where native resentment of Spaniards was still very intense. Armed with nothing but the conviction to learn as much of native culture as he could so that it would be easier for him to destroy it in the future,<ref>Roys, Ralph L. Review of ''Landa's Relacion De Las Cosas De Yucatan: A Translation by Alfred M. Tozzer'', by Alred M. Tozzer. ''The American Historical Review'' (October 1943): 133.</ref> Landa formulated an intimate contact with natives. Natives placed him in such an esteemed position they were willing to show him some of their sacred writings that had been transcribed on deerskin books.<ref>Clendinnen, 69-70</ref> To Landa and the other Franciscan friars, the very existence of these Mayan codices was proof of diabolical practices. In references to the books, Landa said: \n<blockquote>We found a large number of books in these characters and, as they contained nothing in which were not to be seen as superstition and lies of the devil, we burned them all, which they (the Maya) regretted to an amazing degree, and which caused them much affliction.<ref name=\"Clendinnen, 70\">Clendinnen, 70</ref></blockquote>\n\nLanda's insistence of widespread cults throughout the Yucat\u00e1n is backed by ample evidence. Rituals the Spanish conquerors could not understand were labeled as idolatry, superstition, or even devil worship. One such ritual involved clay idols that were used in a strange combination of Catholicism and indigenous religion.<ref name=\"Clendinnen, 70\"/> During the ceremonies, individuals would be crucified and then have their hearts removed from their chest and their blood smeared onto the idols. Such ceremonies were practiced throughout the Yucat\u00e1n up to 45 years after the arrival of the Spaniards.\n\nLanda always believed in his inquisition. Whether magic and idolatry were being practiced or not, Landa was almost certainly \"possessed\" by fantasies of demonic power in a new land.<ref>{{Citation |last=Tedlock |first=Dennis |year=1993 |title=Torture in the Archives: Mayans Meet Europeans |journal=American Anthropologist |volume=95 |issue=1 |pages=139\u2013152 [p. 147] |jstor=681183 |doi=10.1525/aa.1993.95.1.02a00070}}.</ref> Landa, like most other Franciscans, subscribed to millenarian ideas,<ref>Blom, Frans.

Eliminating evil and pagan practices, Landa believed, would usher the [[Second Coming of Christ]] much sooner.\n\nMany historians believe there can be little doubt old traditions would continue even during Spanish rule, and because of \"the resilience of the old social order, and the determination of its custodians to sustain the old ways, some human killings persisted into the post-conquest period....\"<ref>Clendinnen, 182</ref>\n\nWhile it was likely that Landa did coerce exaggerated confessions by torture, he believed so fully that human sacrifice was occurring around him that he was willing to kill a handful of sinners to save the overall community.<ref>Timmer, 480</ref>\n\nLanda's ''Relaci\u00f3n De Las Cosas De Yucat\u00e1n'' is about as complete a treatment of Mayan religion as is ever likely.<ref name=\"Roys, 133\">Roys, 133</ref> While controversy surrounds his use of force in the conversion process, few scholars would debate the general accuracy of his recordings.

His actions were strongly condemned before the Council of the Indies. That resulted in a \"committee of doctors\" being commissioned to investigate Landa's alleged crimes. In 1569, the committee absolved Landa of his crimes. Bishop Toral died in Mexico in 1571, allowing King [[Philip II of Spain]] to appoint Landa as the second  bishop of Yucat\u00e1n.\n\n==Landa and contemporary Mayanist studies==\n[[Image:De Landa alphabet.jpg|thumb|250px|Image of the page from ''Relaci\u00f3n de las Cosas de Yucat\u00e1n'' in which Landa describes his Maya alphabet, which was to prove instrumental in the mid-20th-century breakthrough in [[Maya hieroglyphics]] decipherment.]]Landa's ''[[Relaci\u00f3n de las cosas de Yucat\u00e1n]]'' also created a valuable record of the Mayan [[writing system]], which, despite its inaccuracies, was later to prove instrumental in the [[decipherment]] of the writing system. Landa asked his informants (his primary sources were two Maya individuals descended from a ruling Maya dynasty who were literate in the script) to write down the [[glyph]]ic symbols corresponding to each of the letters of the (Spanish) alphabet, in the belief that there ought to be a one-to-one correspondence between them. The results were faithfully reproduced by Landa in his later account, but he recognised that the set contained apparent inconsistencies and duplicates that he was unable to explain. Later researchers reviewing this material also formed the view that the \"[[de Landa alphabet]]\" was inaccurate or fanciful, and many subsequent attempts to use the transcription remained unconvincing. It was not until much later, in the mid-20th century, when it was realized and then confirmed that it was not a transcription of an ''[[alphabet]]'', as Landa and others had originally supposed, but was rather a [[syllabary]]. That was confirmed only by the work of [[Soviet]] linguist [[Yuri Knorozov]] in the 1950s and the succeeding generation of [[Mayanist]]s.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n== Sources ==\n* {{cite book\n| title=Ambivalent Conquests: Maya and Spaniard in Yucatan, 1517-1570\n| url=https://archive.org/details/ambivalentconque00inga\n| url-access=registration\n| first=Inga\n| last=Clendinnen\n| authorlink=Inga Clendinnen\n| edition=2\n| year=2003\n| publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]\n| isbn=9780521527316}}\n\n* {{cite book\n| title=An interpretation of Bishop Diego de Landa's Maya alphabet.\n| first=Marshall E.\n| last=Durbin\n| year=1969\n| publisher=Middle American Research Institute, [[Tulane University]]\n| location=New Orleans\n| OCLC=1136497}}\n\n* {{cite book\n| title=Yucatan Before and After the Conquest\n| authors=Diego de Landa, William Gates\n| publisher=[[Dover Publications]]\n| url=https://www.globalgreyebooks.com/content/books/ebooks/yucatan-before-and-after-the-conquest.pdf\n| isbn=9780486236223}}\n\n* [[Relaci\u00f3n de las cosas de Yucat\u00e1n]]\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category}}\n* [http://users.skynet.be/fa039055/lifedeat.htm Skynet.be: A biography of Diego de Landa]\n* [http://www.mesoweb.com/bearc/cmr/19.html Mesoweb.com: Research Reports on Ancient Maya Writing] \u2014 ''Glyph Drawings from Landa's Relaci\u00f3n: A Caveat to the Investigator by George Stuart, Center for Maya Research''.\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Landa Calderon, Diego de}}\n[[Category:Franciscan bishops]]\n[[Category:Historians of Mesoamerica]]\n[[Category:Mayanists]]\n[[Category:Mexican Franciscans]]\n[[Category:Novohispanic Mesoamericanists]]\n[[Category:1524 births]]\n[[Category:1579 deaths]]\n[[Category:16th-century historians]]\n[[Category:16th-century Mesoamericanists]]\n[[Category:16th-century Mexican people]]\n[[Category:16th-century Roman Catholic bishops]]\n[[Category:Colonial Mexico]]\n[[Category:Book burnings]]\n[[Category:16th century in the Maya civilization]]\n", "name_user": "WhinyTheYounger", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diego_de_Landa"}

{"title_page": "Linguistics in Science Fiction", "text_new": "{{Ambox | sect = {{{1| article is in the process of being edited for the school project [[Wikipedia:School and university projects/NTU  HG252 Language, Technology and the Internet]]}}} }}\n\n[[Linguistics]] has an intrinsic connection to [[Science Fiction]] stories given the nature of science fiction. As mentioned in ''Aliens and Linguists: Language Study and Science Fiction'' <ref name=\":0\">{{cite book |last1=Meyers |first1=Walter Earl |title=Aliens and linguists: language study and science fiction |date=1980 |publisher=Athens: University of Georgia |url=https://archive.org/details/alienslinguists00walt/page/2/mode/2up |accessdate=23 March 2020}}</ref> by [[Walter E. Meyers]], science fiction is almost always concerned with the idea of communication <ref>{{cite book |last1=Meyers |first1=Walter Earl |title=Aliens and linguists: language study and science fiction |date=1980 |publisher=Athens: University of Georgia |page=2 |url=https://archive.org/details/alienslinguists00walt/page/2 |accessdate=23 March 2020 |chapter=1}}</ref>, such as communication with aliens and machines, or communication using dead languages and evolved languages of the future. Authors of science fiction at times use Linguistics and Linguistic theories as a tool for storytelling, although technical terms are rarely used with authors only going into as much detail as the reader will understand <ref>{{cite book |last1=Meyers |first1=Walter Earl |title=Aliens and linguists: language study and science fiction |date=1980 |publisher=Athens: University of Georgia |page=5 |url=https://archive.org/details/alienslinguists00walt/page/5 |accessdate=23 March 2020 |chapter=1}}</ref>. \n\nWhile Linguistics can be found to be employed by writers of science fiction, it must be noted that not all uses are accurate to actual Linguistics and Linguistic Theories. Nevertheless, there still exists the lingering presence and use of Linguistics (even if inaccurate) in such cases. As mentioned by Walter E. Meyers, the ability to make a story seem more unfamiliar and exotic,  and an alien seem less of a costumed human who merely differs in physical appearance, is only possible through the use of language <ref>{{cite book |last1=Meyers |first1=Walter Earl |title=Aliens and linguists: language study and science fiction |date=1980 |publisher=Athens: University of Georgia |page=8 |url=https://archive.org/details/alienslinguists00walt/page/8 |accessdate=23 March 2020 |chapter=1}}</ref>. It is this ability that appears to draw the boundary between great works of science fiction and those lesser so. As such, Linguistics, the scientific study of language, comes to hold an important role in the genre of science fiction.\n\n== History of Linguistics in Science Fiction ==\n\n=== ''The Lord of the Rings'' and Linguistics ===\n\nSince the mid-1800s, science fiction works using language as the heart of the plot, rather than just a convenient means to advance the story, have reflected the history of linguistics. One such case of the history of linguistics being intertwined with the makings of science fiction involves the author [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], who is known for works such as ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.\n\nThis history begins with the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] (OED), which was 70 years in the making and aimed at \u201c...exhibiting the history and significance of English words now in use, or known to have been in use since the middle of the 12th century\u201d <ref>{{cite book |title=The Compact Edition of the Oxford English Dictionary |date=1991 |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=v |chapter=Historical Introduction}}</ref>. [[William Craigie]], one of the editors of the OED,  tutored undergraduates at Oxford including Tolkien, who he later invited to work as a junior editor of the OED. According to Daniel Grotta-Kurska <ref>{{cite web |title=Daniel Grotta |url=http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Daniel_Grotta |website=Tolkien Gateway}}</ref>, Tolkien\u2019s biographer, it was Craigie who provided \u201cTolkien\u2019s greatest impetus to transform Elvish from an experiment to a life-long pursuit\u201d <ref>{{cite book |last1=Grotta-Kurska |first1=Daniel |title=J. R. R. Tolkien: Architect of Middle Earth |date=1976 |page=38 |url=http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/J.R.R._Tolkien:_Architect_of_Middle-earth}}</ref>. \n\nAs Tolkien built the Elvish language, his science fiction works were aimed at providing a setting for it. ''[[The Silmarillion]]'', which covered the Second Age (a period of time before ''The Lord of the Rings''), was said by Tolkien as having been:\n\n{{Quote\n|text=\"...primarily linguistic in inspiration and was begun in order to provide the necessary background of \u2018history\u2019 for Elvish tongues.\" <ref>{{cite book |last1=Tolkien |first1=J. R. R. |title=Lord of the Rings |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |edition=1977 |chapter=Foreword}}</ref>\n}} \n\nAs [[Walter E. Meyers]] pointed out,\n\n{{Quote\n|text=\"...Tolkien would shape his narrative to fit not just one language at a particular time, but a whole world of languages in earlier and later stages, some related and some not, all molded by principles of historic change.\" <ref>{{cite book |last1=Meyers |first1=Walter Earl |title=Aliens and linguists: language study and science fiction |date=1980 |publisher=Athens: University of Georgia |page=149 |url=https://archive.org/details/alienslinguists00walt/page/70/mode/1up/search/history |accessdate=20 April 2020 |chapter=10}}</ref>\n}} \n\nTrue to this, [[Paul Kocher]] noticed that the evolution of the languages of Middle-Earth was similar to that of the Indo-European languages <ref>{{cite book |last1=Kocher |first1=Paul H. |title=Master of Middle-earth: The Fiction of J. R. R. Tolkien |date=1972 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |page=15 |url=http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Master_of_Middle-earth}}</ref>. \n\nAs Meyers noted, the rich linguistic details encapsulated within ''The Lord of the Rings'' made reading it feel:\n\n{{Quote\n|text=\"... more like reading history, during which we know that the author has not exhausted the subject in the discussion of it.\" <ref name=\"meyers pg 150\">{{cite book |last1=Meyers |first1=Walter |title=Aliens and linguists: language study and science fiction |date=1980 |publisher=Athens: University of Georgia |page=150 |url=https://archive.org/details/alienslinguists00walt/page/70/mode/1up/search/history |accessdate=20 April 2020 |chapter=10}}</ref>\n}} \n\nMeyers attributes most of this feeling to the languages of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', explaining,\n\n{{Quote\n|text=\"We know the existence of a realm of perception beyond our experience when we travel to a country whose language we do not speak. All around us we hear unknown yet articulate sounds, and we know that a culture lies behind them, a culture to which we can be admitted with patience and study.\nIt is much the same with LR; yet there we do not travel not in a foreign country, but in a foreign world, for the languages we encounter are many.\" <ref name=\"meyers pg 150\" />\n}} \n\nIn ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', all the different beings ([[dwarves (Middle-earth)]], [[elves (Middle-earth)]], humans and [[orcs]]) spoke different languages and dialects, with only the [[hobbits]] speaking English. The riders of [[Rohan (Middle-earth)]] spoke Rohirric, illustrated by Tolkien using slightly disguised Old English (especially since the language was archaic compared to that of the hobbits). The [[orcs]] even had a language with different dialects while the language of the elves had history narrated into it. \n\nThe efforts employed by Tolkien to fully create the languages of ''The Lord of the Rings'' and the importance he gives them are obvious from his attention to linguistic detail. This attention to linguistic detail was so great, Meyers in his work ''Aliens and Linguists: Language Study and Science Fiction'' was able to conduct a linguistic analysis on Tolkien\u2019s [[Elvish languages (Middle-earth)]] <ref>{{cite book |last1=Meyers |first1=Walter Earl |title=Aliens and linguists: language study and science fiction |date=1980 |publisher=Athens: University of Georgia |pages=150-156 |url=https://archive.org/details/alienslinguists00walt/page/70/mode/1up/search/history |accessdate=20 April 2020 |chapter=10}}</ref>. Although the full analysis will not be provided, the following content are some conclusions he derived from the analysis.\n\nWith regards to Elvish, there are two forms: ''[[Quenya]]'' and ''[[Sindarin]]''. These two forms are somehow related, with both being derived from an older form of language, although [[Quenya]] was more similar to that older form and withheld certain features of it. The word order of Quenya poetry is flexible, as the suffixes on the words showed their relationships, similar to many inflected languages in the real world, such as [[Latin]] <ref name=\"meyers pg 150\" />. [[Quenya]] appeared to be like [[Indo-European languages]] in its structure, where, for example, a [[verb]] comprises a [[prefix]] (if any), a root and an ending that show [[grammatical tense]], [[grammatical aspect]] and number <ref name=\"meyers pg156\">{{cite book |last1=Meyers |first1=Walter Earl |title=Aliens and linguists: language study and science fiction |date=1980 |publisher=Athens: University of Georgia |page=156 |url=https://archive.org/details/alienslinguists00walt/page/70/mode/1up/search/history |accessdate=20 April 2020 |chapter=10}}</ref>.\n\nAs Meyers concludes from this analysis, \n\n{{Quote\n|text=\"Tolkien\u2019s great trilogy, together with [[The Hobbit]] and [[The Silmarillion]], is a full embodiment of historical linguistics\u2019 highest aims.\" <ref name=\"meyers pg156\" />\n}} \n     \nWith Tolkien\u2019s efforts in his works, science fiction authors have honoured him by referencing his creations in their own works. One example of such a case is [[Hal Clement]]\u2019s ''[[Mission of Gravity]]'', in which the protagonist, Barlennan, sails a ship named \u2018\u2019Bree\u2019\u2019, referencing Tolkien\u2019s Barliman Butterbur, the owner of the inn \u2018The Prancing Pony\u2019 [[Bree (Middle-earth)#The Prancing Pony|The Prancing Pony]] in the town of [[Bree (Middle-earth)]]. In [[James Tiptree Jr.]]\u2019s ''Your Haploid Heart'' <ref>{{cite web |title=Your Haploid Heart |url=https://epdf.pub/your-haploid-heart.html |website=ePDF |accessdate=20 April 2020}}</ref>, [[Mordor]], a fictional realm in Tolkien\u2019s works, was used as a common obscenity, similar to how we use \u2018Hell\u2019. [[A. Bertram Chandler]]\u2019s ''To Keep the Ship'' <ref>{{cite web |title=To Keep The Ship |url=http://www.bertramchandler.com/novels/tokeeptheship.aspx |website=A Bertram Chandler |accessdate=20 April 2020}}</ref> even mentioned a constellation named \u2018The Hobbit\u2019. \n\nSeveral books also went in depth about the languages in the ''The Lord of the Rings'' trilogy. One example of this is the ''[[Parma Eldalamberon]]'' <ref>{{cite web |title=Parma Eldalamberon |url=http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Parma_Eldalamberon |website=Tolkien Gateway |accessdate=20 April 2020}}</ref> (see: [[Elvish Linguistic Fellowship]]), a special interest group of the [[Mythopoeic Society]]. Another example is  ''A Glossary of the Eldarin Tongues'' <ref>{{cite web |title=A Glossary of the Eldarin Tongues |url=http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/A_Glossary_of_the_Eldarin_Tongues |website=Tolkien Gateway |accessdate=20 April 2020}}</ref> written by James D. Allan  <ref>{{cite web |title=Jim Allan |url=http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Jim_Allan |website=Tolkien Gateway |accessdate=20 April 2020}}</ref> in 1972, before it was replaced by ''An Introduction to Elvish'' <ref>{{cite book |author-last1=Allan |author-first1=Jim |author-last2=Carson |author-first2=Nina |title=An Introduction to Elvish: and to other tongues and proper names and writing systems of the third age of the Western Lands of Middle-Earth as set forth in the published writings of Professor John Ronald Reuel Tolkien |date=1978 |url=https://archive.org/details/introductiontoel00alla/page/54 |accessdate=20 April 2020}}</ref>, which discussed the languages in Middle-earth, in 1978. \n\n=== Whorf and Science Fiction ===\n\n[[Franz Boas]], was a self-taught linguist, who focused on the aboriginal languages of [[North America]]. His field experience led to the realisation that using the traditional method of analyzing Western European languages would not work for other languages. Boas wrote the ''Handbook of American Indian Languages'' in 1911, justifying his methods in the book by saying:\n\n{{Quote\n|text=\"It is important at this point to emphasize the fact that the group of ideas expressed by specific phonetic groups show material differences in different languages, and do not conform by any means to the same principles of classification.\" <ref name=\"boas handbook\">{{cite book |last1=Boas |first1=Franz |title=Handbook of American Indian languages |date=1911 |page=25 |url=https://archive.org/details/handbookamerica00fracgoog/page/n9/mode/2up |accessdate=20 April 2020 |chapter=1}}</ref>\n}} \n\n[[Edward Sapir]] met Boas in 1904, and was inspired to begin analysing American Indian languages. Sapir then became [[Benjamin Lee Whorf]]\u2019s mentor. Some parts of Whorf\u2019s later ideas can be found in Sapir\u2019s works, such as in [[linguistic relativity]], which is sometimes referred to as the [[Sapir-Whorf hypothesis]]. \n\nIn 1924, Whorf wrote a science fiction novel called ''The Ruler of the Universe'', which remained unpublished. It narrated the destruction of Earth by a horrific chain reaction caused by the military's research on [[atomic fission]]. According to Peter C. Rollins, it was during the writing of this work that Whorf began to consider the relation between Language and Thought, resulting in the principle of linguistic relativity <ref>{{cite web |last1=Rollins |first1=Peter C. |title=Benjamin Lee Whorf: Transcendental Linguist |url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.0022-3840.1971.0503_673.x |website=Wiley Online Library |accessdate=20 April 2020}}</ref>.\n\nAs summarise by Meyers, \n\n{{Quote\n|text=\"The central question of linguistic relativity is this: does our perception of reality constrain our language or does our language constrain our perception of reality?\" <ref>{{cite book |last1=Meyers |first1=Walter Earl |title=Aliens and linguists: language study and science fiction |date=1980 |publisher=Athens: University of Georgia |page=160 |url=https://archive.org/details/alienslinguists00walt/page/70/mode/1up/search/history |accessdate=20 April 2020 |chapter=10}}</ref>\n}} \n\nA character in [[Roger Zelazny]]\u2019s ''This Moment of the Storm'' proceeded to explore this further:\n\n{{Quote\n|text=\"It\u2019s funny how the mind personifies, engenders. Ships are always women: You say, \u201cShe\u2019s a good old tub,\u201d or \u201cShe\u2019s a fast, tough number, this one,\u201d slapping a bulwark and feeling the aura of femininity that clings to the vessel\u2019s curves; or, conversely, \u201cHe\u2019s a b****** to start, that little Sam!\u201d as you kick the auxiliary engine in an island transport-vehicle; and hurricanes are always women, and moons, and seas. Cities, though are different. Generally, they\u2019re neuter. Nobody calls New York or San Francisco \u2018he\u2019 or \u2018she\u2019. Usually, cities are just \u2018it\u2019. Sometimes, however, [cities] do come to take on the Mediterranean, back on Earth. Perhaps this is because of the sex-ridden nouns of the languages which prevail in that vicinity.\" <ref>{{cite book |last1=Zelazny |first1=Roger |title=This Moment of the Storm |date=1966 |pages=6-7 |url=https://epdf.pub/roger-zelazny-this-moment-of-the-storm.html |accessdate=20 April 2020}}</ref>\n}} \n\nThis came to suggest that language influenced the naming of places (similar to gender assignments seen in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] nouns), an example of language constraining our perception of reality. \n\nIn \u2018\u2019Science and Linguistics\u2019\u2019, Whorf stated that:\n\n{{Quote\n|text=\"All observers are not led by the same physical evidence to the same picture of the universe, unless their linguistic backgrounds are similar, or can in some way be calibrated.\" <ref>{{cite web |last1=Whorf |first1=Benjamin Lee |title=Science and Linguistics |url=https://web.mit.edu/allanmc/www/whorf.scienceandlinguistics.pdf |accessdate=20 April 2020}}</ref>\n}} \n\nWhorf\u2019s principle of linguistic relativity was very much used as material for science fiction novels. For example, it appeared in [[Philip Jos\u00e9 Farmer]]\u2019s ''Prometheus'', in which the protagonist, at one point, suggested teaching different groups of aliens different languages, to test the Whorf hypothesis. \n\nAs pointed out by Meyers, \n\n{{Quote\n|text=\"The Whorf hypothesis has a corollary: if it is true that our language determines our perception of reality, then whoever controls language controls the perceptions of reality as well. If language can be controlled. Then would-be despots have available a subtle and efficient means of restricting thought.\" <ref>{{cite book |last1=Meyers |first1=Walter Earl |title=Aliens and linguists: language study and science fiction |date=1980 |publisher=Athens: University of Georgia |page=163 |url=https://archive.org/details/alienslinguists00walt/page/70/mode/1up/search/history |accessdate=20 April 2020 |chapter=10}}</ref>\n}} \n\nThis is explored in [[George Orwell]]\u2019s work, ''[[Nineteen Eighty-four]]''. The novel tells the story of a government that practises [[totalitarianism]], where even thoughts could be considered an offence (see: [[Thoughtcrime]]). [[Newspeak]] was created by the government, which was a much narrower form of English, to limit [[freedom of thought]]. The list of vocabulary grew smaller each year, and the meanings of the words were reduced as well, all to fit into the political goals of the ruling party. \n\n{{Quote\n|text=\"Don\u2019t you see that the whole aim of Newspeak is to narrow the range of thought? In the end we shall make thoughtcrime literally impossible, because there will be no words in which to express it. \u2026 Every year fewer and fewer words, and the range of consciousness always a little smaller. \u2026 The Revolution will be complete when the language is perfect.\" <ref>{{cite book |last1=Orwell |first1=George |title=Nineteen Eighty-four |date=1949 |page=24}}</ref>\n}}\n\nHowever, the Whorf hypothesis could also work to the advantage of human beings. This was seen in [[Jack Vance]]\u2019s ''[[The Languages of Pao]]'', in which the planet Pao was invaded by another planet and the son of the Emperor of Pao was placed on the throne as the invaders\u2019 puppet. The son, Beran Panasper, sought the help of a scientist, Palafox, from another planet, Breakness, to free Pao. As one of Palafox\u2019s sons said:\n\n{{Quote\n|text=\"Think of a language as the contour of a watershed, stopping flow in certain directions, channeling it into others. Language controls the mechanism of your mind. When people speak different languages, their minds work differently and they act differently.\" <ref>{{cite book |last1=Meyers |first1=Walter Earl |title=Aliens and linguists: language study and science fiction |date=1980 |publisher=Athens: University of Georgia |page=166 |url=https://archive.org/details/alienslinguists00walt/page/70/mode/1up/search/history |accessdate=20 April 2020 |chapter=10}}</ref>\n}} \n\nLinguistic Relativity continues to play a large role in the story, where language constrains world-views of the speaker and can be used as a tool to control or liberate the people. \n\n=== Linguistics in Science Fiction after WWII === \n\nScience fiction works after [[World War II#World War II|WWII]] were influenced by the beliefs behind [[Alfred Korzybski]]\u2019s [[General Semantics]]. When Korzybski launched General Semantics as a self-improvement program, [[John W. Campbell Jr.]] promoted its belief system to many widely read science fiction authors and encouraged people to write about it in works of science fiction <ref>{{cite book |last1=Meyers |first1=Walter Earl |title=Aliens and linguists: language study and science fiction |date=1980 |publisher=Athens: University of Georgia |page=171 |url=https://archive.org/details/alienslinguists00walt/page/171/mode/1up/search/history |accessdate=13 April 2020 |chapter=11}}</ref>. This is in spite of the fact that General Semantics has nothing to do with linguistics. As such, science fiction works of this era often contradict actual [[psycholinguistic]] theories. For example, in ''[[The World of Null-A]]'' by [[A. E. van Vogt]] describes language as having the ability to physically alter the human brain in the sense that if a language portrays reality untruthfully, \u201cbrain damage (in the form of sub-microscopic colloidal lesions) results\u201d <ref>{{cite book |last1=Meyers |first1=Walter Earl |title=Aliens and linguists: language study and science fiction |date=1980 |publisher=Athens: University of Georgia |page=173 |url=https://archive.org/details/alienslinguists00walt/page/173/mode/1up/search/history |accessdate=13 April 2020 |chapter=11}}</ref>. This contradicts any and all psycholinguistic descriptions of [[aphasia]], the only language related brain damage. Even in aphasia, language is not the cause, although the loss of language is an effect. \n\n[[General semantics]] has also inspired ''[[Babel-17]]'' by [[Samuel R. Delany]]. In this story, Delany described a character as being incapable of pronouncing /b/ but capable of pronouncing /p/ due to the presence of fangs. This is not a speech impediment that can be caused by having fangs because the two phonemes share the same method of [[Manner of articulation#Manner of articulation|articulation]], they are both bilabial stops. The only thing that is distinct between the two is [[Voice (phonetics)#Voice (phonetics)|voicedness]]; /b/ is voiced while /p/ is unvoiced. Therefore, the only thing that can cause such a speech impediment is damage to the [[vocal cords]]. Even if there is damage to the vocal cords it only makes sense if the resulting speech impediment was an inability to produce a voiced sound due to the inability for the damaged vocal cords to vibrate properly. ''Babel-17'', despite its linguistic errors, was positively received by its readers. In the same book, Delany confuses between [[grammatical gender]] and [[Sex#Sex|sex]]. He has a character lament over how a \u201csex\u201d can be assigned in some languages but not others. This is incongruent with grammatical gender because it is not about sex and it is not a matter of choice whether or not a speaker uses grammatical gender in a language with grammatical gender.\n\nBecause [[general semantics]] has language as a core concern, it was not uncommon for science fiction authors of its time to adopt it as a basis for the different ways they might imagine language to affect the human mind. This can be seen in ''[[Gulf]]'' by [[Robert A. Heinlein]] where [[Speedtalk]] is described to \u201c[make] thought processes enormously faster\u201d <ref>{{cite book |last1=Heinlein |first1=Robert A. |title=Gulf |date=1949 |page=69 |chapter=part 2}}</ref>. In ''[[Gulf]]'', Heinlein described [[Speedtalk]] as being able to express whole sentences in a word. Together, these features were supposed to make the characters of his book more efficient by means of language. Here, science fiction contradicts linguistics for it has been proven that the speed of thought is independent of the length of a verbal utterance <ref>{{cite web |last1=Netsell |first1=Ron |title=What are estimates for the rate of verbal thoughts (thinking with words)? |url=https://www.researchgate.net/post/What_are_estimates_for_the_rate_of_verbal_thought_thinking_with_words |website=ResearchGate |accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref>. Heinlein also made [[Speedtalk]] to have no real distinction between nouns and verbs because he believed that they were not necessary to be logical. In short, [[Speedtalk]] is yet another product of subscription to the [[Sapir-Whorf hypothesis]]; Heinlein believed that providing his characters with a language he claimed was logical would make them incapable of illogical thought.\n\nIn ''[[The Languages of Pao]]'', however [[Jack Vance]] managed to avoided the mistakes that a lot of other science fiction authors have made. At the same time, Vance employs the [[Sapir-Whorf hypothesis]] in his work; he describes the languages of the Paonese people as being capable of altering their minds.\n\n''The Embedding'' by [[Ian Watson (author)|Ian Watson]], however, contains detailed descriptions of many linguistics concepts and theories, with the language experiments Watson wrote about in his book also receiving praise from Meyers. One criticism Meyers had for it was that it was wrong of Watson to think of [[American English]] as \u201ca totally nonexistent dialect\u201d <ref>{{cite book |last1=Meyers |first1=Walter Earl |title=Aliens and linguists: language study and science fiction |date=1980 |publisher=Athens: University of Georgia |page=191 |url=https://archive.org/details/alienslinguists00walt/page/171/mode/1up/search/history |accessdate=13 April 2020 |chapter=11}}</ref>\n\nMany works are often well received despite their erroneous portrayal linguistics. As a result, readers of these works of science fiction are likely to be misinformed <ref>{{cite book |last1=Meyers |first1=Walter Earl |title=Aliens and linguists: language study and science fiction |date=1980 |publisher=Athens: University of Georgia |url=https://archive.org/details/alienslinguists00walt/page/171/mode/1up/search/history |accessdate=13 April 2020 |chapter=11}}</ref> of linguistic facts. Despite this, linguistic concepts and theories are used as a tool in science fiction to \u201c[give readers] important insights into man and his world\u201d <ref>{{cite book |last1=Meyers |first1=Walter Earl |title=Aliens and linguists: language study and science fiction |date=1980 |publisher=Athens: University of Georgia |page=192 |url=https://archive.org/details/alienslinguists00walt/page/171/mode/1up/search/history |accessdate=13 April 2020 |chapter=11}}</ref>. Even in works that try to be as linguistically accurate as possible, there is still a chance of the author making the [[Sapir-Whorf hypothesis]] its central argument in the language of their fictional world.\n\n== Alien Communication ==\n\nWhen dealing with alien languages, the general practice for science fiction, as described by Meyers, was to \u201cmine earlier stories for themes and approaches, frequently making references to what they regard as flaws or virtues in the works of their predecessors\u201d <ref>{{cite book |last1=Meyers |first1=Walter Earl |title=Aliens and linguists: language study and science fiction |date=1980 |publisher=Athens: University of Georgia |page=96 |url=https://archive.org/details/alienslinguists00walt/page/n9/mode/1up/search/history |accessdate=18 April 2020 |chapter=6}}</ref>. As such, it is common for science fiction works to be inspired by one another in terms of linguistics endeavours.\n\nTo have alien language involved in works of science fiction, there has to be contact between humans and extraterrestrial life forms. This is argued by Meyers to be a \u201cstaple\u201d <ref>{{cite book |last1=Meyers |first1=Walter Earl |title=Aliens and linguists: language study and science fiction |date=1980 |publisher=Athens: University of Georgia |page=86 |url=https://archive.org/details/alienslinguists00walt/page/n9/mode/1up/search/history |accessdate=18 April 2020 |chapter=6}}</ref> of science fiction. Despite the linguistic nature of such a task, Meyers laments that \u201cthe job of a linguist is handled by some other specialist\u201d <ref>{{cite book |last1=Meyers |first1=Walter Earl |title=Aliens and linguists: language study and science fiction |date=1980 |publisher=Athens: University of Georgia |page=87 |url=https://archive.org/details/alienslinguists00walt/page/n9/mode/1up/search/history |accessdate=18 April 2020 |chapter=6}}</ref> and in the works he examined, the characters seem to have no qualms with such a choice. There are several works of science fiction that have professionals with no linguistic training to undertake the attempts at communication with aliens. Such examples include professionals like  astronomers, geologists and poets. To some of these choices, Meyers suggests that the success of science fiction communications \u201cmight be the result of sheer good luck\u201d <ref name=\"meyers, pg88\">{{cite book |last1=Meyers |first1=Walter Earl |title=Aliens and linguists: language study and science fiction |date=1980 |publisher=Athens: University of Georgia |page=88 |url=https://archive.org/details/alienslinguists00walt/page/n9/mode/1up/search/history |accessdate=18 April 2020 |chapter=6}}</ref> for characters are often unfamiliar not only with the alien language they are faced, but linguistics as a whole.\n\nIn science fiction, the success in communication with extraterrestrial life forms often involve no attempt at solving the issue of the language barrier between the human characters and the alien characters. Meyers expresses his distaste for such writing in ''Aliens and Linguists: Language Study and Science Fiction'' with:\n\n{{Quote\n|text=\u201cOne does not resolve a contradiction by asserting it\u201d <ref name=\"meyers, pg88\" />\n}}\n\nGenerally, science fiction authors still use such a non-method. One such example is the translation circuit built into the [[TARDIS]] (see: [[Linguistics in Science Fiction#Automatic Translators|Automatic Translators]]) that automatically resolves any language barrier characters face in their space travel.\n\nAt the same time, science fiction is not completely devoid of attempts at solving the issue of language barriers between the different species of science fiction.\n\nIn ''Tetrahedra of Space'', author [[P. Schuyler Miller]] employs sign language as a means of communication between aliens and humans. This is, however, not before having considered other methods such as drawings. A notable attempt from the novel is that the human in the story draws a diagram of the [[Solar System|solar system]] to explain to the alien its [[Heliocentrism|heliocentric]] nature. This method is susceptible to the [[arbitrariness]] of images. This is similar to the criticisms often applied to the [[Pioneer plaque]] that [[Frank Drake]] and [[Carl Sagan]] placed onboard the [[Pioneer 10]] spacecraft. The diagram in the story, much like the diagrams on the Pioneer plaque, can be easily misunderstood by any nonhuman life form that comes across it. In short, the strategy of using images to communicate with aliens in science fiction is not linguistically robust.\n\nAnother point of discussion brought up by Meyers is the question of whether or not aliens even have the sense of sight. The strategy of using images to communicate with aliens would not even be possible, regardless of its arbitrariness, if the intended recipient is not even capable of seeing it. For example, in ''Old Faithful'' by [[Raymond Z. Gallun]], a Martian astronomer detects a morse code message from Earth. Unfortunately for the Martian, not only can he not understand the message, he is deaf and mute and is therefore unfamiliar with neither the concept that sounds are put together to represent meanings in human language, nor that these strings of sound are represented by an [[orthography]] that can be encoded into signals. Throughout the book, Gallun made the Martian learn the messages he receives from Earth despite his disability.\n\nIn ''[[Swords of Mars]]'' of the [[Barsoom]] series, an example praised by Meyers, author [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]] documented a method with which his alien character learns human language that is similar to that used by linguists. In one of the books, the alien character ignores the attempts of communication made by a human character for being too ambiguous. Instead, he points to things in his surroundings and asks the human for a name. This way, he slowly learns some words in English. \n\nIn ''The Winds of Time'' by [[Chad Oliver]], Oliver not only addressed the issue of there being language barrier but also described a method similar to those a linguist might employ when trying to document an unfamiliar language. The alien even goes on to look for [[minimal pairs]] and with his findings, builds an alien equivalent of the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] (IPA). The alien also learns human languages other than English, the majority language of where his ship landed. Oliver, however, glossed over the [[morphology (linguistics)]] and [[syntax]] part of learning a language and chose to summarise the entire process instead. Overall, Meyers praised this book as having \u201c[set] a high standard of excellence for the use of linguistics\u201d <ref>{{cite book |last1=Meyers |first1=Walter Earl |title=Aliens and linguists: language study and science fiction |date=1980 |publisher=Athens: University of Georgia |page=100 |url=https://archive.org/details/alienslinguists00walt/page/n9/mode/1up/search/history |accessdate=18 April 2020 |chapter=6}}</ref>.\n\nThe minority of its kind, ''[[Story of Your Life]]'' by [[Ted Chiang]]  actually has a linguist attempt communication with an alien species that entered the Earth\u2019s atmosphere. The linguistic concept used in the novella was the [[Sapir-Whorf hypothesis]]. The novella is the source material for the 2016 film, ''[[Arrival (film)]]''.\n\n== Deciphering Languages ==\n\nThe concept of unknown languages appears as a recurring theme in many science fiction books that contain alien languages. In some science fiction works, the deciphering of these unknown languages by protagonists of the story follow the linguistic method similar to that used in the decipherment of ancient Egyptian scripts using the [[Rosetta stone]]. This method involves comparing between translations of the same text, where at least one translation is in a known text. As Meyers puts it, \n\n{{Quote\n|text=\u201c...to decipher a dead language one must have some way of getting into the circle, of finding a connection between something inside the system and something outside it.\u201d <ref>{{cite book |last1=Meyers |first1=Walter Earl |title=Aliens and linguists: language study and science fiction |date=1980 |publisher=Athens: University of Georgia |page=39 |url=https://archive.org/details/alienslinguists00walt/page/39 |accessdate=1 April 2020 |chapter=3}}</ref>\n}}\n\nThis method can be seen in science fiction works such as [[Arrival (film)]] in which a part of the deciphering process involved acquiring translations of English sentences in the alien language to compare and decipher meanings. Another method used in the movie was learning the language one word at a time, see: [[Linguistics in Science Fiction#Alien Communication|Alien Communication]]. This is not a recent phenomenon in science fiction, with such ideas appearing even earlier such as in ''[[This Perfect Day]]'' by [[Ira Levin]]. In the story, the world is unified under an oppressive rule with only one language. The protagonist, a nonconformist, later finds books in other foreign languages and attempts to decipher them with limited success, until he finds a book (in French)  with an essay by the founder of the unified world; an essay which already has a translated version available to him in the language he knows. This, in the same way as the Rosetta Stone, helps him decipher the language (French). Some other works involve lesser accidental Rosetta Stones but rather deliberate clues with the explicit intention of helping future populations decipher the language. In such cases, since there is no way of knowing what future communication is like, there is a preference to use illustrations and other instructional material to help future populations learn the unknown language. Such methods can be found in works such as ''The Retreat to Mars'' by [http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/ea.cgi?1797 Cecil B. White]. \n\nOther works of science fiction involving language decipherment are ''[https://www.unz.com/print/ThrillingWonder-1943aug-00049 Expedition]'' by [[Anthony Boucher]] , ''Resurrection/[[The Monster (short story)]]'' by [[A. E. van Vogt]], ''[[Surface Tension (short story)]]'' by [[James Blish]], ''[[The Star (Clarke short story)|The Star]]'' by [[Arthur C. Clarke]], and ''[[Omnilingual]]'' by [[H. Beam Piper]].\n\nWorks that contain more futile efforts of the decipherment of unknown languages include ''The Pastel City'' ([[Viriconium]] Book 1), ''No Jokes on Mars'' by [[James Blish]], and ''Patron of the Arts'' by [[William Rotsler]].\n\n== Language Change ==\n\nScience fiction highlights the common knowledge about language change, which most writers demonstrated to be very little. \n\n=== Historical Change ===\n\n{{Quote\n|text=\u201cScience fiction as a genre, then, has a special relationship within the field of language within the field of language studies to historical linguistics.\u201d <ref name=\"Meyers, page 12\">{{cite book |last1=Meyers |first1=Walter Earl |title=Aliens and linguists: language study and science fiction |date=1980 |publisher=Athens: University of Georgia |page=12 |url=https://archive.org/details/alienslinguists00walt/page/12 |accessdate=27 March 2020 |chapter=2}}</ref>\n}}\n\nAs mentioned by Walter E. Meyers, science fiction is the only genre that enables writers to either foresee the future of the language or the older forms of language, depending on the context of the story <ref name=\"Meyers, page 12\" />. Despite this, many authors failed to realise the importance of linguistics in science fiction, even those with good knowledge of the field. As noted by [[John Krueger]]: \n\n{{Quote\n|text=\u201c...in perhaps one-third or thereabouts of s-f stories, problems of language and communication raise their head, though not always playing a major role.\u201d <ref name=\"Meyers, page 12\" />\n}}\n\nOne example of this can be viewed in the portrayal of [[historical linguistics]]. Historical linguistics entails the study of the older forms of language, and unfortunately, has been one of the lowest priorities in accuracy for science-fiction authors <ref>{{cite book |last1=Meyers |first1=Walter Earl |title=Aliens and linguists: language study and science fiction |date=1980 |publisher=Athens: University of Georgia |page=15 |url=https://archive.org/details/alienslinguists00walt/page/15 |accessdate=28 March 2020 |chapter=2}}</ref>. In some instances linguistic facts were disregarded such as in [[Harvey Jacobs]]\u2019s ''The Egg of the Glak'' <ref>{{cite web |last1=Jacobs |first1=Harvey |title=The Egg of the Glak |url=https://epdf.pub/harvey-jacobs-the-egg-of-the-glak.html |website=epdf |accessdate=3 April 2020}}</ref>, where the [[Great Vowel Shift]] was said to be caused by the [[Norman Conquest]]. In other instances, linguistic changes were misinterpreted such as in [[Larry Niven]]\u2019s ''The Fourth Profession'' <ref>{{cite book |last1=Meyers |first1=Walter Earl |title=Aliens and linguists: language study and science fiction |date=1980 |publisher=Athens: University of Georgia |page=16 |url=https://archive.org/details/alienslinguists00walt/page/16 |accessdate=28 March 2020 |chapter=2}}</ref>. \n\nHowever, there are authors who have employed linguistic change in their works fairly well. [[Philip Jos\u00e9 Farmer]], for instance, conducted extensive research on the forms of English in different historical periods for his series ''[[Riverworld]]'', resulting in consistent accuracies with language change in English. As Meyers points out,\n\n{{Quote\n|text=\u201cIn general the treatment of linguistic change in science fiction is like the sky on a hazy night: a few bright spots seen through an obfuscating fog.\u201d <ref>{{cite book |last1=Meyers |first1=Walter Earl |title=Aliens and linguists: language study and science fiction |date=1980 |publisher=Athens: University of Georgia |page=18 |url=https://archive.org/details/alienslinguists00walt/page/18 |accessdate=30 March 2020 |chapter=2}}</ref>\n}}\n\n=== Evolutionary Change ===\n\nScience fiction authors have had differing views on how language will change in the future. Some believe English will become incomprehensible such as in  [[H. G. Wells]]\u2019s ''[[The Time Machine]]''. Others hypothesize English will be influenced by other languages, as seen in ''[[A Clockwork Orange (novel)]]'' by [[Anthony Burgess]]. There are, however, science fiction authors who choose neither and proclaim English as the \u201cinterstellar lingua franca as it had on Earth\u201d such as in [[Robert Silverberg]]\u2019s ''Schwartz Between the Galaxies'' <ref>{{cite web |last1=Silverberg |first1=Robert |title=Schwartz between the galaxies |url=https://archive.org/details/feastofstdionysu0000silv/page/n1 |website=Internet Archive |accessdate=1 April 2020 |pages=79-104}}</ref>and in [[Arthur C. Clarke]]\u2019s ''[[Childhood's End]]'', in which English is spoken by everyone. In his ''Visions of Tomorrow'', [http://www.sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/samuelson_david_n David Samuelson] noted that many science-fiction authors prefer English as the universal spoken language in their stories <ref>{{cite book |last1=Samuelson |first1=David |title=Visions of Tomorrow |date=1975 |publisher=New York: Arno Press |url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/work/12296108?q&versionId=26107964 |accessdate=3 April 2020}}</ref>. For written English on the other hand, many science-fiction authors perceive a bleak future. This is seen in works such as [[Walter Miller, Jr.]]\u2019s ''[[A Canticle for Leibowitz]]'', in which the people are reduced to illiteracy due to nuclear war. In [[Algis Budrys]]\u2019s ''For Love'' <ref>{{cite web |last1=Budrys |first1=Algis |title=For Love |url=https://archive.org/stream/Galaxy_v20n05_1962-06#page/n9/mode/2up |website=Internet Archive |accessdate=3 April 2020}}</ref>, it is not nuclear war but rather alien invasion that causes this. In other works such as [[Samuel R. Delaney]]\u2019s ''[[Time Considered as a Helix of Semi-Precious Stones]]'' and [[Robert Sheckley]]\u2019s ''Mindswap'' <ref>{{cite web |last1=Sheckley |first1=Robert |title=Mindswap |url=https://archive.org/details/Galaxy_v23n05_1965-06/page/n7/mode/2up/search/mindswap |website=Internet Archive |accessdate=3 April 2020}}</ref>, written English is not completely wiped out but instead reduced to basic English.\n\n{{Quote\n|text=\u201cmost science fiction writers have \u2026. the habit of being extremely slipshod about language\u2026 The time travelers hop three thousand years into the future and find people still speaking idiomatic New York English. (How many people today speak any language that was used in 1000 B.C.?)\u201d <ref>{{cite book |last1=Meyers |first1=Walter Earl |title=Aliens and linguists: language study and science fiction |date=1980 |publisher=Athens: University of Georgia |page=22 |url=https://archive.org/details/alienslinguists00walt/page/22 |accessdate=30 March 2020 |chapter=2}}</ref>\n}}\n\nAs from the quote by [[Fletcher Pratt]], the future of the language appears to be a topic brushed over by some science-fiction writers, where time-travellers into the future still find themselves being able to communicate perfectly in the same English regardless of the year from which the characters originate. [[Glottochronology]] assumes that a certain amount of basic words in a language will be lost after a thousand years and subsequently <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Gudschinsky |first1=Sarah C. |title=The ABC'S of Lexicostatistics (Glottochronology) |journal=WORD |date=August 1956 |volume=12 |issue=2 |pages=175-210 |doi=10.1080/00437956.1956.11659599 |url=https://doi.org/10.1080/00437956.1956.11659599 |accessdate=2 April 2020}}</ref>. This would mean that the language as we know it now would not be fully similar in the far future. Although, certain writers believed sound recordings would hinder language change, as seen in [[Arthur C. Clarke]]\u2019s ''[[The City and the Stars]]'' <ref>{{cite book |last1=Meyers |first1=Walter Earl |title=Aliens and linguists: language study and science fiction |date=1980 |publisher=Athens: University of Georgia |page=27 |url=https://archive.org/details/alienslinguists00walt/page/27 |accessdate=31 March 2020 |chapter=2}}</ref>.  \n\nHowever, not all writers give a lackluster effort into the future of the language. Science-fiction writers mostly use two methods to demonstrate English of the future: some difference in pronunciation, and the insertion of a few words <ref>{{cite book |last1=Meyers |first1=Walter Earl |title=Aliens and linguists: language study and science fiction |date=1980 |publisher=Athens: University of Georgia |page=29 |url=https://archive.org/details/alienslinguists00walt/page/29 |accessdate=31 March 2020 |chapter=2}}</ref>. The former can be seen in [[Bruce McAllister]]\u2019s ''Benji\u2019s Pencil'' <ref>{{cite web |last1=McAllister |first1=Bruce |title=Benji's Pencil |url=https://archive.org/stream/Fantasy_Science_Fiction_v036n03_1969-03_PDF/Fantasy__Science_Fiction_v036n03_1969-03_PDF_djvu.txt |website=Internet Archive |accessdate=3 April 2020}}</ref>, where English is described as sounding like \u201cnasalised English, chopped but softer than German\u201d 200 years into the future. The inclusion of new words comprise of either forming new words, such as \u201cgoffin\u201d  in [[James Blish]]\u2019s ''[[A Work of Art]]'', or using old words in a new sense such as in [[Samuel R. Delaney]]\u2019s ''The Star Pit'' <ref>{{cite web |last1=Delaney |first1=Samuel R. |title=The Star Pit |url=https://archive.org/details/samuelrdelanythestarpit04/Samuel_R_Delany-The_Star_Pit-01+WBAI.mp3 |website=Internet Archive |accessdate=3 April 2020}}</ref>, in which the word \u201cgolden\u201d is used as a term referring to the only ones capable of withstanding the mental stress of piloting an intergalactic craft. \n\nSuch assumptions on the evolution of language in science fiction might be helpful in predicting the future of language in reality as seen in an undertaking by Peter Stockwell <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Stockwell |first1=Peter |title=Futuretalk: one small step towards a Chronolinguistics |journal=Nottingham Linguistic Circular |date=2000 |volume=15 |pages=55-68}}</ref>. \n\nAll in all, the state of language change in science fiction may be summarized well by the following excerpt from ''Aliens and Linguists: Language Study and Science Fiction'' by Walter E. Meyers <ref name=\"Meyers, pg36-27\">{{cite book |last1=Meyers |first1=Walter Earl |title=Aliens and linguists: language study and science fiction |date=1980 |publisher=Athens: University of Georgia |pages=36-37 |url=https://archive.org/details/alienslinguists00walt/page/36 |accessdate=2 April 2020 |chapter=2}}</ref>:\n\n{{Quote\n|text=\u201c...science fiction is a window not into the future but into the present: in its stories we see what the writers know about language in general and historical linguistics in particular.\u201d <ref name=\"Meyers, pg36-27\" />\n}}\n\n== Learning Alien Language ==\n\nAlthough works of science fiction throughout history have employed different methods of learning alien language, their methods of language learning are not the standard. According to [[Walter E. Meyers]] in ''Aliens and Linguists: Language Study and Science Fiction'', short stories were common in science fiction works of the time. This meant that for the sake of storytelling, authors usually had no room for extended descriptions on the process of language learning. When the process of language learning is described, it is usually not a central concern; some authors might try to document the process but most others would ignore it altogether. As Beverly Friend pointed out, having aliens learn human language rather than the opposite was a popular strategy <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Friend |first1=Beverly |title=Strange Bedfellows: Science Fiction Linguistics & Education |journal=The English Journal |date=October 1973 |volume=62 |issue=7 |pages=998-1003 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/813614?seq=1}}</ref>. When human characters do learn alien languages, it is commonly done through the strategies listed below:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Method of Learning\n! Description\n! Appearing works\n|-\n| Hypnosis\n| Popular method after WWII.\n| ''[[Vril#Vril|The Coming Race (1871)]]'' by [[Edward Bulwer-Lytton]]\n|-\n| Neural changes\n| Language skills treated as encoded data.\n| ''The Linguist (1975)'' by [[Stephen Robinett#Stephen Robinett|Tak Hallus]]\n|-\n| Sleep-learning\n| Characters learn an unfamiliar language in their sleep.\n| ''Sweet Helen'' by Charles W. Runyon <ref>{{cite web |title=Summary Bibliography: Charles W.

Sources, from which journals are found, include [[National Geographic]], [[Science Magazine]], and [[Science News-Letter|Science News-letter]], under the categories of learning and memory, rather than linguistics journals.\n\nSome authors might make it such that a character required to learn a language is naturally skilled at doing so. Such characters are usually super-humanly efficient language learners. One such example is [[John Carter of Mars#John Carter of Mars|John Carter]], a character in [[Edgar Rice Burrough]]\u2019s ''[[Barsoom]]'' series. Similar to this strategy, other authors make the unfamiliar language simple to learn; one such example can be seen in ''[[Across the Zodiac]]'' by [[Percy Greg]]. Despite Greg\u2019s description of the language as simple, the structure of the language is still that of an [[Indo-European language]]. This makes the language only simple to the author whose very own language is Indo-European. When languages are simple, [[John Krueger]] <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Krueger |first1=John R. |title=Language and Techniques of Communication as Theme or Tool in Science-Fiction |journal=Linguistics: An International Review |date=1968 |volume=39 |pages=68-86}}</ref> argues that authors cannot resist the temptation of making it difficult in some aspect of language. Although, difficulty in phonology can be justified considering alien anatomy.\n\nThere are still authors who do away with the need for language learning altogether. For example, in ''Doorway in the Sand'' by [[Roger Zelazny]], Zelazny introduced an interpreter to resolve the language barrier between his human and alien characters . This way, he circumvented the need for any language learning process. (Related to: [[Linguistics in Science Fiction#Alien Communication|Alien Communication]]) \n\nIn his book, Meyers wrote that authors have a preconceived notion that language learning is hard and even labelled ''Childhood\u2019s End'' by [[Arthur C. Clarke]] as being overrated for equating language learning to the construction of the pyramids.\n\n== Language Medium ==\n\nWith invented species, aliens, and other such characters in science fiction comes not only constructed languages but also new mediums using which these characters speak. As Meyers points out:\n\n{{Quote\n|text=\u201c... the science fiction writer frequently invents both the message and the medium.\u201d <ref>{{cite book |last1=Meyers |first1=Walter Earl |title=Aliens and linguists: language study and science fiction |date=1980 |publisher=Athens: University of Georgia |page=69 |url=https://archive.org/details/alienslinguists00walt/page/69/mode/1up/search/history |accessdate=10 April 2020 |chapter=5}}</ref>\n}}\n\n=== Auditory (Sound)===\n\nA common medium of communication employed by science fiction authors is the familiar one of vocal-auditory used by humans. In order to make this more exotic and suited to the alien theme of the story, some writers choose to tweak the method of producing this medium of communication. This could come in the form of a difference in physiology or structure of the alien as seen in [[Isaac Asimov]]\u2019s ''[[Hostess (short story)|Hostess]]''. In his story, Asimov\u2019s alien is described as having a different mouth structure to a human, although his speech sounds similar to that of a human on Earth:\n\n{{Quote\n|text=\u201cThe construction of his mouth, combined with an absence of incisors , gave a whistling sound to the sibilants. Aside from that, he might have been born on Earth for all the accent his speech showed.\u201d <ref>{{cite book |last1=Asimov |first1=Isaac |title=The Complete Stories |date=1951 |page=354}}</ref>\n}}\n\n[[Gordon R. Dickson]] describes just as much in his work ''The Christmas Present'' (see: [[The Star Road]]), with the jellyfish-like alien described as having a voice that was:\n\n{{Quote\n|text=\u201c...croaky and unbeautiful, for a constricted air-sac is not built for the manufacture of human words.\u201d <ref>{{cite book |last1=Dickson |first1=Gordon R. |title=The Christmas Present |date=1973 |page=83}}</ref>\n}}\n\n[[John Brunner]] also goes into detail about the method of sound production of his aliens in his work ''The Dramaturges of Yan'', writing that the aliens had lungs at their sides,\n\n{{Quote\n|text=\u201c...drawing in air directly through spiracles between the ribs; like bagpipes, they had continual through-put. Sound to talk with was generated by a tympanal membrane and relayed through resonating chambers in the gullet, giving a rather pleasant, if not monotonous, timbre; in Kaydad\u2019s case, resembling a cello droning away on a single note\u2026\u201d <ref>{{cite book |last1=Brunner |first1=John |title=The Dramaturges of Yan |date=1972 |page=44}}</ref>\n}}\n\n[[Cyril M. Kornbluth]] uses a rather different method from these in his work ''Friend to Man'' (see: ''[[The Explorers (collection)]]''), in which the alien resembles a cello in the way it produces sound and not just in the way it sounds. This method of producing sound is described in the following excerpt of an interaction between the alien and a man named Smith who was rescued by the alien:\n\n{{Quote\n|text=\u201c\"Salt?\" asked Smith, his voice thin in the thin air. \u201cI need salt with water.\u201d\nThe thing rubbed two appendages together and he saw a drop of amber exude and spread on them. It was, he realised a moment later, rosining the bow, for the appendages drew across each other and he heard a whining, vibrating cricket voice say: \u201cS-s-z-z-aw-w?\u201d\nIt did better the next time. The amber drop spread, and \u201cS-z-aw-t?\u201d was sounded, with a little tap of the bow for the final phoneme.\u201d <ref>{{cite book |last1=Kornbluth |first1=Cyril M. |title=Friend to Man |date=1951 |page=243}}</ref>\n}}\n\nThis theme of aliens producing sound in a way similar to a musical instrument (and perhaps physically resembling one as well) is continued by [[James Blish]] in his work ''This Earth of Hours''. In the story, the aliens are known as \u201cCall\u00ebans\u201d and the character, 12-UpJohn, discovers how they speak, saying:\n\n{{Quote\n|text=\u201c... the sounds issued at low volume from a multitude of spiracles or breath-holes all along the body, each hole producing only one pure tone, the words and intonations being formed in mid-air by intermodulation - a miracle of co-ordination among a multitude of  organs obviously unsuitable for sound-forming at all.\u201d <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Blish |first1=James |title=This Earth of Hours |journal=The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction |date=June 1959 |page=12}}</ref>\n}}\n\nThe theme of musical communication has appeared in science fiction as early as 1638 in [[Francis Godwin]]\u2019s work ''[[The Man in the Moone]]''. It also appeared in [[Winfred P. Lehmann]]\u2019s ''Decoding of the Martian Language''. Since W. P. Lehmann is a linguist, his story was explained in far greater scientific detail than most other science fiction authors.\n\nWhen it comes to the auditory medium, however, there is also communication at frequencies above and below that of what is audible to humans. For example, in [[Henry Kuttner]]\u2019s ''The Big Night'', the aliens communicate using frequencies below what is audible to humans (subsonics) and wear a device to increase this frequency to one that is audible to humans when communicating with them. In ''[[Mission of Gravity]]'' by [[Hal Clement]], the alien is able to communicate in both a frequency higher than what is perceived by humans and a frequency perceivable by humans. The aliens in ''[[In a Good Cause\u2014]]'' by [[Isaac Asimov]] had similar abilities, having a specialised organ for the higher frequencies and a separate one for frequencies audible to humans. \n\nMore science fiction stories involving the vocal-auditory medium as a means of communication include ''[[Proxima Centauri (short story)]]'' by [[Murray Leinster]], ''[[Arrival (film)]]'' (although the aliens in ''Arrival'' had two mediums of communication, one vocal-auditory and the other through visuals), and in ''[[Star Trek]],'' where alien communication is prevalent.\n\n=== Visual (Sight) ===\n\nThe second most popular choice of language medium in science fiction is the visual medium or sight. One such story using this medium is ''[[Venus on the Half-Shell]]'' by Kilgore Trout ([[Philip Jos\u00e9 Farmer]]), in which the aliens used their limbs to make signs in order to communicate:\n\n{{Quote\n|text=\u201c\u201cWhat do they talk with?\u201d Simon said to Chworktap.\n\t\u201cThey use their fingers, just like deaf-and-dumb people.\u201d\n\u2026 Their arms came out, the fingers wriggling and crossing and bending as they asked each other what in the hell these strangers were and what did they mean to do?\u201d <ref>{{cite book |last1=Farmer |first1=Philip Jos\u00e9 |title=Venus on the Half-Shell |date=1975 |page=101}}</ref>\n}}\n\n[[James Blish]] also explored the use of visual medium in communication in his work ''VOR''. In the story, the alien communicated using colour-shifts in the light spectrum (displayed colours on the front of its head). Similar to this was the aliens in [[Rex Gordon]]\u2019s ''First on Mars/[[No Man Friday]]'', in which the aliens (as big as freight trains) also communicated using light with the main character remarking \u201c...there simply has not been on Earth such a colloquy of light.\u201d <ref>{{cite book |last1=Gordon |first1=Rex |title=No Man Friday |date=1956 |page=158}}</ref>. In ''[[What Is This Thing Called Love? (short story)]]'' by [[Isaac Asimov]], the aliens also communicated through colour, using color patches that changed hue to communicate. In ''Death and Designation Among the Asadi'' by [[Michael Bishop (author)]], Bishop describes in detail a similar form of communication:\n\n{{Quote\n|text=\u201cAs for the staring matches, they\u2019re of brief duration and involve fierce gesticulation and mane-shaking. In these head-to-head confrontations the eyes change colour with astonishing rapidity, flashing through the entire visible spectrum -and maybe beyond- in a matter of seconds.\n\tI am now prepared to say that these instantaneous changes of eye color are the Asadi equivalent of speech\u2026\u201d <ref>{{cite book |last1=Bishop |first1=Michael |title=Death and Designation Among the Asadi |date=January 1973 |page=175}}</ref>\n}}\n\n=== Olfactory (Smell)===\n\nAlthough much more challenging to employ, smell has also been used as a medium of communication by science fiction authors. In ''Doomship'' by [[Frederik Pohl]] and [[Jack Williamson]], the aliens (T\u2019worlies) communicate through smells. As noticed by a human character in the story, \n\n{{Quote\n|text=\u201cThe vinegary smell deepened. It was a sign of polite cogitation in a T\u2019worlie, like a human being\u2019s hmmm\u201d <ref>{{cite book |author-last1=Pohl |author-first1=Frederik |author-last2=Williamson |author-first2=Jack |title=Doomship |date=1973 |page=42}}</ref>\n|author=|title=|source=}}\n\nSimilar to this method of communication is one employed the alien species in ''Cabin Boy'' (see ''[[Far Out (book)]]'') by [[Damon Knight]]. In this story, two humans attempt to communicate with the alien that uses scent, although this proves rather difficult:\n\n{{Quote\n|text=\u201c...there had been a series of separate odors, all unfamiliar and all overpoweringly strong. At least a dozen of them, Roget thought; they had gone past too quickly to count.\u201d <ref>{{cite book |last1=Knight |first1=Damon |title=Far Out |date=1951 |chapter=Cabin Boy}}</ref>\n}}\n\nAs Meyers points out, however, the challenge in \u201c...using air-borne scents for communication is that even a casual breeze becomes \u201cnoise\u201d in the system, blending odors and distorting their original sequence.\u201d <ref>{{cite book |last1=Meyers |first1=Walter Earl |title=Aliens and linguists: language study and science fiction |date=1980 |publisher=Athens: University of Georgia |page=80 |url=https://archive.org/details/alienslinguists00walt/page/69/mode/1up/search/history |accessdate=12 April 2020 |chapter=5}}</ref>. Then again, [[Colin Kapp]] overcomes this problem in his work ''The Old King\u2019s Answers'', in which the one character describes the aliens as having:\n\n{{Quote\n|text=\u201c...scent glands in the pads of their feet\u2026 They\u2019ve settled on the flat faces of the crystal rocks when they really want to leave a message for the world.\u201d <ref name=\"old king's answers, pg167\">{{cite book |last1=Kapp |first1=Colin |title=The Old King's Answers |date=1973 |page=167}}</ref>\n}}\n\nThe character further goes on to explain:\n\n{{Quote\n|text=\u201cUsing chromatography, I\u2019ve managed to identify three individual scent products, all of them remarkably persistent. They are combined together on the crystal faces in an amazing spectrum of complexity. In their scent-writing they have the capacity -though I\u2019m not sure how much of it they utilize- to compress more bits of information in a given space than we humans can in our optical writing.\u201d <ref name=\"old king's answers, pg167\" />\n}}\n\nThis medium of smell was also utilised by [[John Norman]] in his work ''Priest-Kings of Gor'' (Book 3 of ''[[Gor]]''), in which the medium is not only described but the advantages and disadvantages of it is also discussed. In the story, the narrator describes the medium, saying:\n\n{{Quote\n|text=\u201cWhat in the passageways I had taken to be the scent of Priest-Kings had actually been the residue of odor-signals which Priest-Kings, like certain social insects of our world, use in communicating with one another.\u201d <ref>{{cite book |last1=Norman |first1=John |title=Priest-Kings of Gor |date=1968 |page=77}}</ref>\n}}\n\nThe narrator then goes on to discuss in length the advantageous and disadvantageous of such a medium:\n\n{{Quote\n|text=\u201cCommunication by odor-signals can in certain circumstances be extremely efficient, though it can be disadvantageous in others. For example, an odor can carry\u2026 much farther than can the shout or cry of a man to another man. Moreover, if not too much time is allowed to elapse, a Priest-King may leave a message in his chamber or in a corridor for another Priest-King, and the other may arrive later and interpret. A disadvantage of this mode of communication, of course, is that the message may be understood by strangers or by others for whom it is not intended. One must be careful of what one says in the tunnels of the Priest-Kings for one\u2019s words may linger after one, until they sufficiently dissipate to be little more than a meaningless blur of scent.\u201d <ref>{{cite book |last1=Norman |first1=John |title=Priest-Kings of Gor |date=1968 |page=78}}</ref>\n}}\n\nSince Norman placed his setting in \u201ctunnels\u201d, he rid himself of any problems posed by winds. A similar approach was taken by [[Hal Clement]] in his work ''[[Uncommon Sense]]'', in which he had gotten rid of air altogether by assuming his setting to be an airless planet.\n\n=== Kinesics (Movement/Gestures)===\n\nAs explained by Meyers, gestures\n\n{{Quote\n|text=\u201c...are as arbitrary in their meanings as any spoken word: they depend for their intelligibility on the prior agreement by the members of the community.\u201d <ref>{{cite book |last1=Meyers |first1=Walter Earl |title=Aliens and linguists: language study and science fiction |date=1980 |publisher=Athens: University of Georgia |page=82 |url=https://archive.org/details/alienslinguists00walt/page/70/mode/1up/search/history |accessdate=12 April 2020 |chapter=5}}</ref>\n}}\n\nThis code-like aspect of gestures is seen in science fiction stories involving [[kinesics]] as a medium for language. One such example of this is seen in ''Orn'' (Book 2 of ''[[Of Man and Manta]]'') by [[Piers Anthony]]. In this story, \u201cmanta-shaped flying fungoids\u201d used kinesics for communication in that they snapped their tails once for \u2018yes\u2019 and twice for \u2018no\u2019 when communicating with humans. This code eventually evolved and allowed the fungoids to initiate conversation, \u201cwith that combination of gesture and tail snaps they had gradually worked out as their code\u201d <ref>{{cite book |last1=Anthony |first1=Piers |title=Orn |date=1970 |page=147}}</ref>.\n\nIn some cases, however, [[kinesics]] was not employed as a medium of communication on its own but together with other mediums. For example, in ''The Dance of the Changer and the Three'' by [[Terry Carr]], the aliens called \"Loarrans\" communicated via \u201cwave-dancing\u201d, which seemed in part an art form rather than just communication:\n\n{{Quote\n|text=\u201cThe dance he went through to give the description was intricate and even imaginative\u2026 It used motion and color and sound and another sense something like smell.\u201d <ref>{{cite book |last1=Carr |first1=Terry |title=The Dance of the Changer and the Three |date=1968}}</ref> \n}}\n\nIn the case of the \"Nildoror\", aliens in ''[[Downward to the Earth]]'' by [[Robert Silverberg]], they had no limbs that they were able to use to gesture (having walked on all fours). Hence, they had other appendages to do so. As the narrator explains:\n\n{{Quote\n|text=\u201cThe spiny crest down the middle of the alien\u2019s broad skull began to twitch\u2026 The nildoror had a rich language of gesture, employing not only the spines but also their long ropy trunks and their many-pleated ears,\u201d <ref>{{cite book |last1=Silverberg |first1=Robert |title=Downward to the Earth |date=1970 |pages=8-9}}</ref>  \n}}\n\nThere are also some science fiction works that include tactile ([[touch]]) as a medium of communication. These include works such as ''[[Memoirs of a Spacewoman]]'' by [[Naomi Mitchison]], and ''[[The Word for World is Forest]]'' by [[Ursula K. Le Guin]].\n\n== Machines & Language ==\n\n=== Machine Speech ===\n\nMachines have been another popular theme in science fiction works, appearing in works like ''[[I, Robot (film)]]'', ''[[Ex Machina (film)]]'' , ''[[Chappie (film)]]'', ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey]]'', and even much older works such as ''[[The Moon is a Harsh Mistress]]'' by [[Robert A. Heinlein]]. In such works, machines are portrayed with the ability to speak just as well or even better than humans. This ability is almost always explained from the perspective of computer programming as was done in ''The Moon is a Harsh Mistress'', although it has just as much to do with linguistics, especially in order to sound natural enough to be indistinguishable from a regular human. \n\n[[Speech synthesis]] occurring in science fiction works can be categorised into two forms. The first form is synthesised speech, which is completely produced by the machine itself and is the form of speech synthesis portrayed by Robert A. Heinlein in ''The Moon is a Harsh Mistress''. The second form appearing in science fiction works is one in which stored pre-recorded bits of human speech are assembled by the machine to form speech <ref name=\"Meyers pg 45\">{{cite book |last1=Meyers |first1=Walter Earl |title=Aliens and linguists: language study and science fiction |date=1980 |publisher=Athens: University of Georgia |page=45 |url=https://archive.org/details/alienslinguists00walt/page/45/mode/2up |accessdate=5 April 2020 |chapter=3}}</ref>. This form of machine-generated speech appeared in works such as ''[[Autofac]]'' by [[Philip K. Dick]], in which speech produced by the machine is void of any intonations or other prosody. \n\nIn more recent works, such as ''[[I, Robot (film)|I, Robot]]'' , ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'', and even the [[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]] trilogy ([[J.A.R.V.I.S.]]), machines are portrayed as having speech that sounds just as natural as that of a regular human. In ''The Machine'' by [[John W. Campbell]] (from ''The Best of John W. Campbell''), the machine-produced voice was described as being \u201c...peculiarly commanding, a superhuman voice of perfect clarity and perfect resonance. It was commanding, attracting, yet pleasant.\u201d. This manner of human-like speech can also be seen in ''You\u2019ll take the High Road'' by [[John Brunner (novelist)|John Brunner]] (from ''Three Trips in Time and Space'') and ''[[Galactic Pot-Healer]]'' by [[Philip K. Dick]]. Ira Levin has also utilised the idea of fluent human-like speech in his science fiction work ''[[The Stepford Wives]]'', in which human-like androids are made to replace mens\u2019 wives after they have been murdered by their husbands. The androids, needing to be perfect copies of the women, use machine-generated voices that gain their vocabulary from recordings of the women\u2019s actual voices.\n\nHowever, in many other works, machine speech was used to portray \u201chuman depersonalisation\u201d. In ''Promises to Keep: A Science Fiction Drama'' from ''Alien Horizons'' by [[William F. Nolan]], Nolan described the computerised ship\u2019s voice as \u201cmetallic, emotionless\u201d <ref name=\"Meyers pg 45\" />. This portrayal could be traced back to even older works such as ''The Last Evolution'' <ref>{{cite web |author1=John W. Campbell, Jr. |title=The Last Evolution |url=https://www.gutenberg.org/files/27462/27462-h/27462-h.htm |website=Project Gutenberg |accessdate=5 April 2020 |archivedate=December 2008}}</ref> by John W. Campbell in which machine speech is described as\n\n{{Quote\n|text=\u201c...the vibrationally correct, emotionless tones of all the race of machines.\u201d \n}}\n\nOther work involving this theme of depersonalisation includes works such as ''[[It's Such a Beautiful Day]]'' by [[Isaac Asimov]], ''[[The Quest for Saint Aquin]]'' by Anthony Boucher, ''The Hawks of Arcturus'' by Cecil Snyder, ''I, the Unspeakable'' <ref>{{cite web |author1=Walter J. Sheldon |title=I, the Unspeakable |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51210 |website=Project Gutenberg |accessdate=5 April 2020}}</ref> by Walter J. Sheldon<ref>{{cite web |title=Walter J. Sheldon |url=https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_J._Sheldon |website=Wikip\u00e9dia |accessdate=6 April 2020 |language=French}}</ref>, and ''[[The Ship Who Sang]]'' by [[Anne McCaffrey]].\n\nGiven the scientific capabilities to add prosody to machine-generated speech, Walter E. Meyers was critical of this use of emotionless machine speech in science fiction works, as shown from the following excerpt:\n\n{{Quote\n|text=\u201c...the problems of adding pitch, stress, and juncture (the transitions between words and phrases) to machine-produced speech were mastered well before William F. Nolan wrote the passage\u2026 Writers who now speak of emotionless mechanical voices do so either through ignorance or, more probably, because they value the symbolism involved more highly than scientific accuracy.\u201d \n}}\n\nMore works utilising the general theme of machine speech are ''Jamboree'' by [[Jack Williamson]], ''Becalmed in Hell'' <ref>{{cite web |author1=Larry Niven |title=Becalmed in Hell |url=https://www.baen.com/Chapters/9781481483605/9781481483605___6.htm |website=Space Pioneers |accessdate=5 April 2020}}</ref> by Larry Niven, ''Starchild'' by [[Frederik Pohl]] and [[Jack Williamson]] (part of the ''[[Starchild Trilogy]]''), ''Evane (1973)'' by [[E.C. Tubb]], and ''Stranger Station'' by [[Damon Knight]].\n\n=== Automatic Translators ===\n\nIn many works of science fiction with language as part of the plot, the idea of automatic translators has been frequently brought up <ref name=\"meyers, pg 119\">{{cite book |last1=Meyers |first1=Walter Earl |title=Alien and linguists: language study and science fiction |date=1980 |publisher=Athens: University of Georgia |page=119 |url=https://archive.org/details/alienslinguists00walt/page/119/mode/2up |accessdate=6 April 2020 |chapter=8}}</ref>. These translators can be split into two main types: translators translating from a known language to another known language, and those translating from an unknown language to a known language. \n\nWalter E. Meyers noted that translators of the first kind (known-to-known) were usually small devices, \u201c...typically worn as a pendent or pinned to the shirt\u201d <ref name=\"meyers, pg 119\" />. This can be seen in ''Jackal\u2019s Meal'' (collected in ''[[The Star Road]]'') by [[Gordon R. Dickson]]. Such a device also appeared in ''A Little Knowledge'' by [[Poul Anderson]], in which a small device worn on the chest and called a \u2018Vocalizer\u2019 translated English into the known language of aliens. More works involving this type of automatic translators include ''The Brains of Earth'' by [[Jack Vance]].\n\nThe second type of translator (unknown-to-known) seems to appear more often in science fiction works and can be alternatively known as a \u201c[[Universal Translator]]\u201d. In ''I\u2019ll Be Waiting for You When the Swimming Pool is Empty'' by [[James Tiptree Jr.]], the protagonist uses a universal translator called the \u2018Omniglot Mark Eight Vocoder\u2019 that instantly translates whatever is being said to the necessary alien language although the characters themselves do not know what language that is. \n\nThe universal translator also makes multiple appearances in science fiction movies and shows. In ''[[Men in Black (1997 film)|Men in Black]]'' [[Men in Black (1997 film)|(1997 film)]], a universal translator is introduced during the tour of the MIB headquarters. In ''[[Star Trek]]'', a Universal Translator is frequently used to translate alien languages into known languages of the user. ''[[Doctor Who]]'' also played with the idea of a universal translator, with the universal translator being part of the [[TARDIS]]. This recurring theme of universal translators being part of a ship or mode of transport was also seen in ''[[Ringworld]]'' by Larry Niven.\n\nContrary to this theme, works such as ''[[Inconstant Moon#\"How the Heroes Die\"|\"How the Heroes Die\",]]'' also by Larry Niven, and ''Unhuman Sacrifice'' by [[Katherine Maclean]] portrayed the universal translator as a less portable, more fixed-in-place computer. Even further from this theme are works such as ''[[The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy]]'', in which the universal translator is not in the form of a machine at all. In ''The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy'', the universal translator exists instead as a \u2018babel fish\u2019 that is inserted into the ear.\n\n== Animals and Language ==\n\nScience fiction plots concerning animals and language can to an extent be divided into two main themes, the first being the popular theme of teaching animals to produce human speech, and the second being the less popular theme of learning the language of the animals themselves.\n\n=== Teaching Animals Human Languages ===\n\nAs Meyers puts it, \u201cWe have long felt the desire, even the need, to speak to the creatures around us, which parrots and the like do little to satisfy\u201d<ref name=\":0\" />. A great example of such a desire is seen from the ''[[Planet of the Apes]]'' movie franchise. This desire is also explored by older works such as [[Clifford D Simak]]\u2019s ''Census'', one of the tales appearing in his work ''[[City (novel)#City (novel)|City]]''. In the story, a character named Bruce Webster surgically alters dogs to give them the ability to speak. [[Harlan Ellison]] also explores a similar theme in his work ''[[A Boy and His Dog]], in which ''a dog named \u201cBlood\u201d is capable of speech, speaking perhaps even better than his human, Vic. Blood, however, speaks through telepathy rather than actual outspoken speech (see: [[Linguistics in Science Fiction#Telepathy|Telepathy]]).  \n\nAnother instance similar to Blood but involving communicating out loud is the horse from ''Dream Done Green'' by [[Alan Dean Foster]]. In the story, the human character Micah Schell discovers a hormone that is capable of enabling higher mammals to have the mental abilities of at least a human 10-year-old. One horse, however, far exceeds this and is capable of speaking 18 languages, with the sound of his speech being described as:\n\n{{Quote\n|text=\"a mellow tenor that tended to rise on concluding syllables, only to break and drop like a whitecap on the sea before the next word.\" <ref>{{cite book |last1=Foster |first1=Alan Dean |title=Dream Done Green |date=1974 |page=4}}</ref>\n}}\n\nScience fiction authors dealing with this theme of animals capable of human speech mostly suggest a physical change that allows animals to have the capacity for human speech, especially considering the differences in sound production through the [[vocal tract]] between animals and humans. One writer that explicitly states this physical change is [[James H. Schmitz]] in his work ''[[The Demon Breed]]''. In this story, Sweeting, one of three 7.5 foot otters capable of speech is described as being \u201ca product of a geneticist\u2019s miscalculation\u201d. The ancestors of Sweeting are said to have been \n\n{{Quote\n|text=\"... a development of a preserved Teran otter strain, tailored for an oceanic existence. The coastal rancher who\u2019d brought the consignment was startled some months later when the growing cubs began to address him in a slurrily chopped-up version [of his language].\" <ref>{{cite book |last1=Schmitz |first1=James H. |title=The Demon Breed |date=1968 |page=50}}</ref>\n}}\n\nWhile such cases of genetic mutation have been used as a common mechanism to explain changes enabling animals to execute human speech production, some authors of science fiction at times do not use it correctly. For example, in the case of ''[[The Blue Giraffe]]'' by [[L. Sprague de Camp]], the offspring of baboons mutated through exposure to radiation are described to have physically altered only in size and yet were able to speak in [[Xhosa language#Xhosa language|Xhosa]] that was taught to them by a ranger in the wildlife preserve they inhabited. As Meyers noted of de Camp\u2019s writing,\n\n{{Quote\n|text=\"Computer simulation of primate vocal range was unknown when de Camp wrote, of course, but there had been indications, even in science fiction itself, that without changes in bone structure and musculature, the baboons could not have mastered the phonology of Xhosa or any other human language.\" <ref>{{cite book |last1=Meyers |first1=Walter Earl |title=Aliens and linguists: language study and science fiction |date=1980 |publisher=Athens: University of Georgia |page=56 |url=https://archive.org/details/alienslinguists00walt/page/171/mode/1up/search/history |accessdate=14 April 2020 |chapter=4}}</ref>\n}}\n\nA good example of a detailed explanation into human speech production in primates can be seen in ''Pithecanthropus Rejectus'' by [[Manly Wade Wellman]]. In the story, Wellman details the problems faced by the character, an ape, in human speech production as well as how it was overcome by \u201cthe Doctor\u201d, another character in the story.\n\n{{Quote\n|text=\"As I learned to speak and to comprehend, I found out the cause of those pains. I was told by the tall, smiling blond woman who taught me to call her \u2018Mother\u2019. She explained that I had been born with no opening in the top of my skull - so needed for bone and brain expansion - and that the man of the house - \u2018Doctor\u2019 - had made such an opening governing the growth of my cranium and later stopping the hole with a silver plate. My jaw, too, had been altered with silver, for when I was born it had been too shallow and narrow to give my tongue play. The building of a chin for me and the remodeling of several tongue-muscles had made it possible for me to speak.\" <ref>{{cite book |last1=Wellman |first1=Manly Wade |title=Pithecanthropus Rejectus |date=1938 |page=423}}</ref>\n}}\n\nAnother method used by science fiction writers to introduce physical changes enabling human speech production in non-human animals is genetic engineering. This method appeared in ''Doomship'' by [[Frederik Pohl]] and [[Jack Williamson]]. In the story, Pohl and Williamson also describe the challenges involved in human speech production by non-human animals:\n\n{{Quote\n|text=\"A chimpanzee is simply not human. His physiology is one count against him. He cannot develop the brain of a human being because his skull is the wrong shape - and because the chemistry of his blood does not carry enough nourishment to meet the demands of abstract thought. He cannot fully master speech because he lacks the physical equipment to form the wide variety of phonemes in human language. The molecular-biology people knew how to deal with that. They could do things like widening the angle of the cranium called the kyphosis, thus allowing the brain to round out full frontal lobes, or restructuring tongue and palate, even adding new serum components to the blood like the alpha2 globulins that bind human hemoglobin.\" <ref>{{cite book |author-last1=Pohl |author-first1=Frederik |author-last2=Williamson |author-first2=Jack |title=Doomship |date=1973 |page=58}}</ref> \n}}\n\n=== Humans Learning Animal Languages ===\n\nWhen it comes to the less popular and much rarer theme of humans learning the languages of the animals, there are only few examples present in science fiction works. Known examples would include the following: \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Title and Author \n!Plot Summary\n|-\n|''The Bees of Knowledge'' by [[Barrington J. Bayley]]\n|The main character attempts to communicate (unsuccessfully) with giant alien bees who hold him captive using knowledge of bee communication on Earth. \n|-\n|''Interface'' by [[A. A. Attanasio]]\n|An investigator raises a boy and dolphin together from childhood in attempts to have communication between them both\n|-\n|''People of the Sea / [[Dolphin Island (novel)]]'' by [[Arthur C. Clarke]] \n|A device is built for communication between humans and dolphins\n|} \n\nIn Clarke\u2019s story, however, the device, resembling an over-sized wrist watch, would convert pre-selected words (appearing as buttons on the device) into the language of dolphins. This does not really involve learning the animal language itself but rather relies on a translation device (Related to [[Linguistics in Science Fiction#Automatic Translators|Automatic Translators]]). Although, this does imply that the animal language has already been decoded and learnt, especially for the translator to actually work.\n\n== Telepathy ==\n\n[[Telepathy]] has been a recurring [[motif (narrative)]] in science fiction stories, for the most part being used as a convenient tool to bypass linguistic problems that writers encounter <ref>{{cite book |last1=Meyers |first1=Walter Earl |title=Aliens and linguists: language study and science fiction |date=1980 |publisher=Athens: University of Georgia |page=131 |url=https://archive.org/details/alienslinguists00walt/page/2/mode/2up |accessdate=4 April 2020 |chapter=9}}</ref>. This is illustrated in [[H. G. Wells]]\u2019s ''[[Men Like Gods]]'' (1923). In this science fiction story, telepathy is used in daily communications, although the accuracy of what is communicated differs from person to person, with thought being rephrased and reflected based on the receiver's linguistic ability. Wells, through his character's dialogue, directly mentions how convenient a solution telepathy is to linguistic problems such as language barriers (related to: [[Linguistics in Science Fiction#Alien Communication|Alien Communication]]):\n\n{{Quote\n|text=\u201cAnd all things considered, it is really very convenient for us that there should be this method of transmission. For otherwise, I do not see how we could have avoided weeks of linguistic bother, first principles of our respective grammars, logic, significs, and so forth, boring stuff for the most part, before we could have got to anything like our present understanding\u201d<ref>{{Cite book|last=Wells|first=H. G.|title=Men Like Gods|publisher=Cassell (UK), Macmillan (US)|year=1923|isbn=|location=UK, US|pages=}}</ref> \n}}However, while conveniently giving a solution to that linguistic issue, Wells's form of telepathy seemed to create problems for other aspects of linguistics. Given that language change is a result of variations in speech, Walter E. Meyers suggested that this telepathy would result in an obstruction to language evolution (see: [[Linguistics in Science Fiction#Evolutionary Change|Evolutionary Change]]).\n\n{{Quote\n|text=\u201c...a universal telepathic power would slow down, and perhaps even halt [language] change altogether, if (and this is an important condition) change in language results from normal but inevitable variation in speech forms\u201d <ref>{{cite book |last1=Meyers |first1=Walter Earl |title=Aliens and linguists: language study and science fiction |date=1980 |publisher=Athens: University of Georgia |pages=134-135 |url=https://archive.org/details/alienslinguists00walt/page/2/mode/2up |accessdate=4 April 2020 |chapter=9}}</ref>\n|author=|title=|source=}}\n\nAlthough affecting speech, telepathy would not isolate writing from changes, as illustrated by Burrough in his Martian novels, where Mars has several forms of written language despite having only one spoken language. \n\nAs noted by Walter E. Meyers, Wells use of telepathy implies that:\n\n{{Quote\n|text=\u201c...telepathy transmits linguistic constructions\u201d <ref>{{cite book |last1=Meyers |first1=Walter Earl |title=Aliens and linguists: language study and science fiction |date=1980 |publisher=Athens: University of Georgia |page=136 |url=https://archive.org/details/alienslinguists00walt/page/2/mode/2up |accessdate=4 April 2020 |chapter=9}}</ref>\n}}\n\nIn doing so, however, differences between linguistic, lexical, and even cultural concepts of different language speakers would still hinder understanding between speakers using telepathy. The challenges presented by cultural barriers, for example, was presented in the work ''Prott'' by [[Margaret St. Clair]], in which a telepath laments that despite conducting 52 interviews with aliens named \u201cPrott\u201d he has been unable to learn much. As John W. Campbell pointed out in an editorial (see: [[Analog Science Fiction and Fact]]: Astounding, June 1941)\n\n{{Quote\n|text=\u201cMost of our words have background references that we know so well we tend to overlook them.\u201d \n}}\n\nAs per this quote, these background references may be easily understood by speakers of a language but not to the rest. Paul A. Carter summarised this well, explaining that \u201c... in situations demanding discernment of the cultural context of words, there might be trouble.\u201d <ref>{{cite book |last1=Meyers |first1=Walter Earl |title=Aliens and linguists: language study and science fiction |date=1980 |publisher=Athens: University of Georgia |page=137 |url=https://archive.org/details/alienslinguists00walt/page/2/mode/2up |accessdate=4 April 2020 |chapter=9}}</ref>.\n\nGiven such a problem, some science-fiction writers suggested pictures were transmitted via telepathy instead of words <ref name=\"meyers pg 138\">{{cite book |last1=Meyers |first1=Walter Earl |title=Aliens and linguists: language study and science fiction |date=1980 |publisher=Athens: University of Georgia |page=138 |url=https://archive.org/details/alienslinguists00walt/page/2/mode/2up |accessdate=4 April 2020 |chapter=9}}</ref>. This could be seen in works like [[Judith Merril]]\u2019s ''Whoever You Are'' <ref>{{cite web |title=The Best of Judith Merril |url=https://epdf.pub/the-best-of-judith-merril.html |website=ePDF |accessdate=4 April 2020 |page=18-31}}</ref> and Michael Elder <ref>{{cite web |title=Michael Elder |url=https://www.fantasticfiction.com/e/michael-elder/ |website=Fantastic Fiction |accessdate=4 April 2020}}</ref>\u2019s ''Flight to Terror'' (also known as ''Perfumed Planet'' <ref>{{cite web |title=The Perfumed Planet |url=https://www.fantasticfiction.com/e/michael-elder/perfumed-planet.htm |website=Fantastic Fiction |accessdate=4 April 2020}}</ref>). However, the process of transmitting pictures still involves a hidden form of linguistic structure, as mentioned by Meyers:\n\n{{Quote\n|text=\u201cIt is difficult to divorce the transmission of information in whatever medium from predications; introspection, if we can rely on it, seems to confirm that we think in linguistic structures.\u201d <ref name=\"meyers pg 138\" />\n}}\n\nThis brings back the question of barriers in language mentioned before. [[Stanley G. Weinbaum]] attempted to address this issue in his work ''[[The Lotus Eaters (Weinbaum)|The Lotus Eaters]]'', where the partly telepathetic alien learned the language from humans through its ability to read links between words as well as the conceptual meanings of the words, though only after the words are used by the humans. One other example of this concept of telepathy being limited to the surface of one\u2019s conscious mind appears in ''[[To Die in Italbar]]'' by [[Roger Zelazny]].\n\n[[Robert Heinlein]]\u2019s ''[[Time for the Stars]]'', however, presents a rather convincing argument that words, and not pictures, are transmitted through telepathy <ref>{{cite book |last1=Walter |first1=Walter Earl |title=Aliens and linguists: language study and science fiction |date=1980 |publisher=Athens: University of Georgia |page=139 |url=https://archive.org/details/alienslinguists00walt/page/2/mode/2up |accessdate=5 April 2020 |chapter=9}}</ref>. In the novel, the characters tried telepathy without using any words, but found \u201c...the silly, incoherent rumbling that went on in [the other\u2019s] mind in place of thought was as confusing and annoying, as senseless as finding yourself inside another person\u2019s dream <ref>{{cite book |last1=Heinlein |first1=Robert A. |title=Time for the Stars |date=1956 |page=28}}</ref>. The habitual receiving of each other\u2019s thoughts as words was explained by the psychologist in the novel as:\n\n{{Quote\n|text=\u201cThe ears and eyes and fingers are just data collectors; it is the brain that abstracts order out of chaos of data and gives it meaning\u2026 You expect words, your brain \u2018hears\u2019 words; it is a process used to and knows how to handle.\u201d <ref>{{cite book |last1=Heinlein |first1=Robert A. |title=Time for the Stars |pages=28-29}}</ref>\n}}\n\nDespite all these explanations offered by science fiction authors, telepathy still seems to be something unknown. As written in ''[[Blind Alley]]'' by [[Isaac Asimov]]:\n\n{{Quote\n|text=\u201cTelepathy! Telepathy! Telepathy! Might as well say by witch brew; Nobody knows anything about telepathy except its name. What is the mechanism of telepathy? What is the physiology and the physics of it?\u201d <ref>{{cite book |last1=Asimov |first1=Isaac |title=Blind Alley |page=178}}</ref>\n}}\n\nSeveral characters in science fiction novels do attempt to explore the workings of telepathy, however, such as the characters in [[Walter M. Miller Jr.]]\u2019s ''Command Performance'', or  [[Fritz Leiber]]\u2019s ''Deadly Moon''. \n\nRegardless of the reason behind the use of telepathy by authors of science fiction, whether a real interest in the topic or convenience, it is as Meyers points out:\n\n{{Quote\n|text=\u201c...there is no question that writers find the subject a fertile one for an array of linguistic functions.\u201d <ref>{{cite book |last1=Meyers |first1=Walter Earl |title=Aliens and linguists: language study and science fiction |date=1980 |publisher=Athens: University of Georgia |page=145 |url=https://archive.org/details/alienslinguists00walt/page/2/mode/2up |accessdate=5 April 2020 |chapter=9}}</ref>\n}}\n\n== Dystopian and Utopian Works of Science Fiction ==\n\nIn ''[[iarchive:alienslinguists00walt|Aliens and Linguists: Language Study and Science Fiction]]'', [[Walter E. Meyers]] stated that whether a work is [[Dystopia|Dystopian]] or [[Utopia|Utopian]] is a matter of perspective. To decide if a science fiction piece is intended by the author to be a dystopia or a utopia, Meyers argued, it is helpful to examine the language use in the fictional world of the book. The method that Meyers suggested in his book is not one of [[stylistics]] but to instead study how the language(s) spoken by characters are dictated, or not, by their leaders. According to Meyers, 30% to 50% of science fiction works touch on language in some ways while a high percentage of utopia science fiction works have language as a concern; at the same time, the importance of language can be missed by science fiction authors. \n\nFor this type of analysis, Meyers established that works of science fiction intended as Dystopian would involve thought control by fictional governments, often done through the control of the language of their fictional citizens. This means that more often than not, science fiction authors who touch on language are subscribers of the [[Sapir-Whorf hypothesis]]. \n\nThis type of language control can be seen in [[George Orwell]]\u2019s ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'', in the use of [[Newspeak]], which was aimed at making unorthodox political thought impossible. ''[[wikisource:The_Works_of_the_Rev._Jonathan_Swift/Volume_6/A_Voyage_to_the_Country_of_the_Houyhnhnms|A Voyage to the Country of the Houyhnhnms]]'' by [[Jonathan Swift]] is another example of this control. In his book, Meyers described Swift\u2019s manipulation in the novel as \u201celiminat[ing] dissent by destroying the ability of language to express fictions, theories, falsehoods, indeed, anything other than a statement of fact\u201d <ref>{{cite book |last1=Meyers |first1=Walter Earl |title=Aliens and linguists: language study and science fiction |date=1980 |publisher=Athens: University of Georgia |page=198 |url=https://archive.org/details/alienslinguists00walt/page/171/mode/1up/search/history |accessdate=12 April 2020 |chapter=12}}</ref>. In short, Swift\u2019s manipulation of language was an attempt to manipulate reality in his novel.\n\nFor these authors\u2019 Dystopian governments to work, Meyers argued that they \u201cmust not only enslave words, but also prevent the natural forces of languages from freeing them\u201d <ref>{{cite book |last1=Meyers |first1=Walter Earl |title=Aliens and linguists: language study and science fiction |date=1980 |publisher=Athens: University of Georgia |page=209 |url=https://archive.org/details/alienslinguists00walt/page/171/mode/1up/search/history |accessdate=12 April 2020 |chapter=12}}</ref>. This was because [[language change]] could become a form of liberation; words for dissent can be borrowed from other languages, made from existing words or coined entirely anew. To prevent language change from happening, authors wrote certain preventative measures into their stories.\n\n<br />\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Aspect of Language Change\n! Preventative Measures\n! Appearing Works\n|-\n| New vocabulary from borrowing\n| Forbid foreign contact.\nForbid foreign language learning.\n|''[[Walden Two]]'' by [[B. F. Skinner]]\nPeople were not allowed contact with the outside world and any time outside the present. Author described books as \"ancient junk\".\n|-\n| New vocabulary made from existing words\n| Regulate meanings of words through official dictionaries.\nTotal control of education, indoctrinate populace.\n|''[[The Dispossessed]]: An Ambiguous Utopia'' by [[Ursula Le Guin]]\nCharacters were forced to memorise dictionaries and word use was dictated. \n\nA language was designed to embody the principles of the society of the book.\n\n\n''[[Walden Two]]'' by [[B. F. Skinner]]\n\nThe government of the book adds books to their libraries as often as they remove books as a form of censorship.\n\n|-\n| New vocabulary coined anew\n| Almost impossible to forestall, try to interrupt spread instead.\nControl means of communication and jail creators to prevent future attempts.\n|''[[Walden Two]]'' by [[B. F. Skinner]]\nLanguage use was dictated, people had no access to private radios and were not allowed to turn off the national radio.\n|}\n\n\nMeyers also claimed that languages were used in science fiction as a tool for world building where authors often manipulated language in order to make their fictional worlds a Dystopian one. Meyers even went as far as to claim that the genre was \u201cespecially suited\u201d <ref name=\"meyers pg208\">{{cite book |last1=Meyers |first1=Walter Earl |title=Aliens and linguists: language study and science fiction |date=1980 |publisher=Athens: University of Georgia |page=208 |url=https://archive.org/details/alienslinguists00walt/page/171/mode/1up/search/history |accessdate=12 April 2020 |chapter=12}}</ref> for giving instruction about language.\n\nMeyers also lamented on the different ways science fiction missed out on opportunities to make a well-rounded and holistic manipulation of language for world building. One example he gave was of ''The Troika Incident'' <ref>{{cite book |last1=Brown |first1=James Cooke |title=The Troika Incident |date=1970 |url=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17436963-the-troika-incident}}</ref> by [[James Cooke Brown]]. Brown wrote the novel to test, with [[Loglan]], the [[Sapir-Whorf hypothesis]]. The characters in the novel were given the constructed language under the name Panlan to see if the constraints of the language would make their thought more logical. Given its Utopian nature, Brown wrote the novel such that Loglan speakers had a perfect feedback loop and kept improving the language as they spoke it, making it more logical. Loglan speakers, however, need to expand the vocabulary of Loglan for their society to function. Yet, as Meyers pointed out, Brown missed the opportunity to expand on how the language might evolve in the novel. \n\nMeyers also mentioned specific examples of figurative and creative uses of language that would not work in Loglan, which Brown could have gone in depth about. For example, if there were a music band named ''The Killers'' in the fictional world of the novel, speakers would need to create a word in Loglan that could be [[Interlinear gloss#Interlinear gloss|glossed]] as kill.\u0274\u1d0d\u1d22, yet can not be understood as a synonym of murderer. By design, creative word use would not work in Loglan. Additionally, Meyers commented that Brown neglected the possibility of language change in his fictional world, which might have made Loglan less logical than he would have liked.\n\nMeyers also argued that if fictional societies in science fiction were great, they were so \u201cin spite of a language designed for propaganda and a government willing to employ it\u201d <ref name=\"meyers pg208\" />\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Bongo-Bongo (linguistics)]]\n* [[Chinese word for \"crisis\"]]\n* [[Elvish languages (Middle-earth)]]\n* [[Folk linguistics]]\n* [[List of common misconceptions about language learning]]\n* [[Neuro-linguistic programming]]\n* [[Perceptual dialectology]]\n\n== References ==\n<!-- Inline citations added to your article will automatically display here.

As mentioned in ''Aliens and Linguists: Language Study and Science Fiction'' <ref name=\":0\">{{cite book |last1=Meyers |first1=Walter Earl |title=Aliens and linguists: language study and science fiction |date=1980 |publisher=Athens: University of Georgia |url=https://archive.org/details/alienslinguists00walt/page/2/mode/2up |accessdate=23 March 2020}}</ref> by [[Walter E. Meyers]], science fiction is almost always concerned with the idea of communication <ref>{{cite book |last1=Meyers |first1=Walter Earl |title=Aliens and linguists: language study and science fiction |date=1980 |publisher=Athens: University of Georgia |page=2 |url=https://archive.org/details/alienslinguists00walt/page/2 |accessdate=23 March 2020 |chapter=1}}</ref>, such as communication with aliens and machines, or communication using dead languages and evolved languages of the future. Authors of science fiction at times use Linguistics and Linguistic theories as a tool for storytelling, although technical terms are rarely used with authors only going into as much detail as the reader will understand <ref>{{cite book |last1=Meyers |first1=Walter Earl |title=Aliens and linguists: language study and science fiction |date=1980 |publisher=Athens: University of Georgia |page=5 |url=https://archive.org/details/alienslinguists00walt/page/5 |accessdate=23 March 2020 |chapter=1}}</ref>. \n\nWhile Linguistics can be found to be employed by writers of science fiction, it must be noted that not all uses are accurate to actual Linguistics and Linguistic Theories. Nevertheless, there still exists the lingering presence and use of Linguistics (even if inaccurate) in such cases. As mentioned by Walter E. Meyers, the ability to make a story seem more unfamiliar and exotic,  and an alien seem less of a costumed human who merely differs in physical appearance, is only possible through the use of language <ref>{{cite book |last1=Meyers |first1=Walter Earl |title=Aliens and linguists: language study and science fiction |date=1980 |publisher=Athens: University of Georgia |page=8 |url=https://archive.org/details/alienslinguists00walt/page/8 |accessdate=23 March 2020 |chapter=1}}</ref>. It is this ability that appears to draw the boundary between great works of science fiction and those lesser so. As such, Linguistics, the scientific study of language, comes to hold an important role in the genre of science fiction.\n\n== History of Linguistics in Science Fiction ==\n\n=== ''The Lord of the Rings'' and Linguistics ===\n\nSince the mid-1800s, science fiction works using language as the heart of the plot, rather than just a convenient means to advance the story, have reflected the history of linguistics. One such case of the history of linguistics being intertwined with the makings of science fiction involves the author [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], who is known for works such as ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.\n\nThis history begins with the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] (OED), which was 70 years in the making and aimed at \u201c...exhibiting the history and significance of English words now in use, or known to have been in use since the middle of the 12th century\u201d <ref>{{cite book |title=The Compact Edition of the Oxford English Dictionary |date=1991 |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=v |chapter=Historical Introduction}}</ref>. [[William Craigie]], one of the editors of the OED,  tutored undergraduates at Oxford including Tolkien, who he later invited to work as a junior editor of the OED. According to Daniel Grotta-Kurska <ref>{{cite web |title=Daniel Grotta |url=http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Daniel_Grotta |website=Tolkien Gateway}}</ref>, Tolkien\u2019s biographer, it was Craigie who provided \u201cTolkien\u2019s greatest impetus to transform Elvish from an experiment to a life-long pursuit\u201d <ref>{{cite book |last1=Grotta-Kurska |first1=Daniel |title=J. R. R. Tolkien: Architect of Middle Earth |date=1976 |page=38 |url=http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/J.R.R._Tolkien:_Architect_of_Middle-earth}}</ref>. \n\nAs Tolkien built the Elvish language, his science fiction works were aimed at providing a setting for it. ''[[The Silmarillion]]'', which covered the Second Age (a period of time before ''The Lord of the Rings''), was said by Tolkien as having been:\n\n{{Quote\n|text=\"...primarily linguistic in inspiration and was begun in order to provide the necessary background of \u2018history\u2019 for Elvish tongues.\" <ref>{{cite book |last1=Tolkien |first1=J. R. R. |title=Lord of the Rings |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |edition=1977 |chapter=Foreword}}</ref>\n}} \n\nAs [[Walter E. Meyers]] pointed out,\n\n{{Quote\n|text=\"...Tolkien would shape his narrative to fit not just one language at a particular time, but a whole world of languages in earlier and later stages, some related and some not, all molded by principles of historic change.\" <ref>{{cite book |last1=Meyers |first1=Walter Earl |title=Aliens and linguists: language study and science fiction |date=1980 |publisher=Athens: University of Georgia |page=149 |url=https://archive.org/details/alienslinguists00walt/page/70/mode/1up/search/history |accessdate=20 April 2020 |chapter=10}}</ref>\n}} \n\nTrue to this, [[Paul Kocher]] noticed that the evolution of the languages of Middle-Earth was similar to that of the Indo-European languages <ref>{{cite book |last1=Kocher |first1=Paul H. |title=Master of Middle-earth: The Fiction of J. R. R. Tolkien |date=1972 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |page=15 |url=http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Master_of_Middle-earth}}</ref>. \n\nAs Meyers noted, the rich linguistic details encapsulated within ''The Lord of the Rings'' made reading it feel:\n\n{{Quote\n|text=\"... more like reading history, during which we know that the author has not exhausted the subject in the discussion of it.\" <ref name=\"meyers pg 150\">{{cite book |last1=Meyers |first1=Walter |title=Aliens and linguists: language study and science fiction |date=1980 |publisher=Athens: University of Georgia |page=150 |url=https://archive.org/details/alienslinguists00walt/page/70/mode/1up/search/history |accessdate=20 April 2020 |chapter=10}}</ref>\n}} \n\nMeyers attributes most of this feeling to the languages of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', explaining,\n\n{{Quote\n|text=\"We know the existence of a realm of perception beyond our experience when we travel to a country whose language we do not speak. All around us we hear unknown yet articulate sounds, and we know that a culture lies behind them, a culture to which we can be admitted with patience and study.\nIt is much the same with LR; yet there we do not travel not in a foreign country, but in a foreign world, for the languages we encounter are many.\" <ref name=\"meyers pg 150\" />\n}} \n\nIn ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', all the different beings ([[dwarves (Middle-earth)]], [[elves (Middle-earth)]], humans and [[orcs]]) spoke different languages and dialects, with only the [[hobbits]] speaking English. The riders of [[Rohan (Middle-earth)]] spoke Rohirric, illustrated by Tolkien using slightly disguised Old English (especially since the language was archaic compared to that of the hobbits). The [[orcs]] even had a language with different dialects while the language of the elves had history narrated into it. \n\nThe efforts employed by Tolkien to fully create the languages of ''The Lord of the Rings'' and the importance he gives them are obvious from his attention to linguistic detail. This attention to linguistic detail was so great, Meyers in his work ''Aliens and Linguists: Language Study and Science Fiction'' was able to conduct a linguistic analysis on Tolkien\u2019s [[Elvish languages (Middle-earth)]] <ref>{{cite book |last1=Meyers |first1=Walter Earl |title=Aliens and linguists: language study and science fiction |date=1980 |publisher=Athens: University of Georgia |pages=150-156 |url=https://archive.org/details/alienslinguists00walt/page/70/mode/1up/search/history |accessdate=20 April 2020 |chapter=10}}</ref>. Although the full analysis will not be provided, the following content are some conclusions he derived from the analysis.\n\nWith regards to Elvish, there are two forms: ''[[Quenya]]'' and ''[[Sindarin]]''. These two forms are somehow related, with both being derived from an older form of language, although [[Quenya]] was more similar to that older form and withheld certain features of it. The word order of Quenya poetry is flexible, as the suffixes on the words showed their relationships, similar to many inflected languages in the real world, such as [[Latin]] <ref name=\"meyers pg 150\" />. [[Quenya]] appeared to be like [[Indo-European languages]] in its structure, where, for example, a [[verb]] comprises a [[prefix]] (if any), a root and an ending that show [[grammatical tense]], [[grammatical aspect]] and number <ref name=\"meyers pg156\">{{cite book |last1=Meyers |first1=Walter Earl |title=Aliens and linguists: language study and science fiction |date=1980 |publisher=Athens: University of Georgia |page=156 |url=https://archive.org/details/alienslinguists00walt/page/70/mode/1up/search/history |accessdate=20 April 2020 |chapter=10}}</ref>.\n\nAs Meyers concludes from this analysis, \n\n{{Quote\n|text=\"Tolkien\u2019s great trilogy, together with [[The Hobbit]] and [[The Silmarillion]], is a full embodiment of historical linguistics\u2019 highest aims.\" <ref name=\"meyers pg156\" />\n}} \n     \nWith Tolkien\u2019s efforts in his works, science fiction authors have honoured him by referencing his creations in their own works. One example of such a case is [[Hal Clement]]\u2019s ''[[Mission of Gravity]]'', in which the protagonist, Barlennan, sails a ship named \u2018\u2019Bree\u2019\u2019, referencing Tolkien\u2019s Barliman Butterbur, the owner of the inn \u2018The Prancing Pony\u2019 [[Bree (Middle-earth)#The Prancing Pony|The Prancing Pony]] in the town of [[Bree (Middle-earth)]]. In [[James Tiptree Jr.]]\u2019s ''Your Haploid Heart'' <ref>{{cite web |title=Your Haploid Heart |url=https://epdf.pub/your-haploid-heart.html |website=ePDF |accessdate=20 April 2020}}</ref>, [[Mordor]], a fictional realm in Tolkien\u2019s works, was used as a common obscenity, similar to how we use \u2018Hell\u2019. [[A.

One example of this is the ''[[Parma Eldalamberon]]'' <ref>{{cite web |title=Parma Eldalamberon |url=http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Parma_Eldalamberon |website=Tolkien Gateway |accessdate=20 April 2020}}</ref> (see: [[Elvish Linguistic Fellowship]]), a special interest group of the [[Mythopoeic Society]]. Another example is  ''A Glossary of the Eldarin Tongues'' <ref>{{cite web |title=A Glossary of the Eldarin Tongues |url=http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/A_Glossary_of_the_Eldarin_Tongues |website=Tolkien Gateway |accessdate=20 April 2020}}</ref> written by James D. Allan  <ref>{{cite web |title=Jim Allan |url=http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Jim_Allan |website=Tolkien Gateway |accessdate=20 April 2020}}</ref> in 1972, before it was replaced by ''An Introduction to Elvish'' <ref>{{cite book |author-last1=Allan |author-first1=Jim |author-last2=Carson |author-first2=Nina |title=An Introduction to Elvish: and to other tongues and proper names and writing systems of the third age of the Western Lands of Middle-Earth as set forth in the published writings of Professor John Ronald Reuel Tolkien |date=1978 |url=https://archive.org/details/introductiontoel00alla/page/54 |accessdate=20 April 2020}}</ref>, which discussed the languages in Middle-earth, in 1978. \n\n=== Whorf and Science Fiction ===\n\n[[Franz Boas]], was a self-taught linguist, who focused on the aboriginal languages of [[North America]]. His field experience led to the realisation that using the traditional method of analyzing Western European languages would not work for other languages. Boas wrote the ''Handbook of American Indian Languages'' in 1911, justifying his methods in the book by saying:\n\n{{Quote\n|text=\"It is important at this point to emphasize the fact that the group of ideas expressed by specific phonetic groups show material differences in different languages, and do not conform by any means to the same principles of classification.\" <ref name=\"boas handbook\">{{cite book |last1=Boas |first1=Franz |title=Handbook of American Indian languages |date=1911 |page=25 |url=https://archive.org/details/handbookamerica00fracgoog/page/n9/mode/2up |accessdate=20 April 2020 |chapter=1}}</ref>\n}} \n\n[[Edward Sapir]] met Boas in 1904, and was inspired to begin analysing American Indian languages. Sapir then became [[Benjamin Lee Whorf]]\u2019s mentor. Some parts of Whorf\u2019s later ideas can be found in Sapir\u2019s works, such as in [[linguistic relativity]], which is sometimes referred to as the [[Sapir-Whorf hypothesis]]. \n\nIn 1924, Whorf wrote a science fiction novel called ''The Ruler of the Universe'', which remained unpublished. It narrated the destruction of Earth by a horrific chain reaction caused by the military's research on [[atomic fission]]. According to Peter C. Rollins, it was during the writing of this work that Whorf began to consider the relation between Language and Thought, resulting in the principle of linguistic relativity <ref>{{cite web |last1=Rollins |first1=Peter C. |title=Benjamin Lee Whorf: Transcendental Linguist |url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.0022-3840.1971.0503_673.x |website=Wiley Online Library |accessdate=20 April 2020}}</ref>.\n\nAs summarise by Meyers, \n\n{{Quote\n|text=\"The central question of linguistic relativity is this: does our perception of reality constrain our language or does our language constrain our perception of reality?\" <ref>{{cite book |last1=Meyers |first1=Walter Earl |title=Aliens and linguists: language study and science fiction |date=1980 |publisher=Athens: University of Georgia |page=160 |url=https://archive.org/details/alienslinguists00walt/page/70/mode/1up/search/history |accessdate=20 April 2020 |chapter=10}}</ref>\n}} \n\nA character in [[Roger Zelazny]]\u2019s ''This Moment of the Storm'' proceeded to explore this further:\n\n{{Quote\n|text=\"It\u2019s funny how the mind personifies, engenders. Ships are always women: You say, \u201cShe\u2019s a good old tub,\u201d or \u201cShe\u2019s a fast, tough number, this one,\u201d slapping a bulwark and feeling the aura of femininity that clings to the vessel\u2019s curves; or, conversely, \u201cHe\u2019s a b****** to start, that little Sam!\u201d as you kick the auxiliary engine in an island transport-vehicle; and hurricanes are always women, and moons, and seas. Cities, though are different. Generally, they\u2019re neuter. Nobody calls New York or San Francisco \u2018he\u2019 or \u2018she\u2019. Usually, cities are just \u2018it\u2019. Sometimes, however, [cities] do come to take on the Mediterranean, back on Earth. Perhaps this is because of the sex-ridden nouns of the languages which prevail in that vicinity.\" <ref>{{cite book |last1=Zelazny |first1=Roger |title=This Moment of the Storm |date=1966 |pages=6-7 |url=https://epdf.pub/roger-zelazny-this-moment-of-the-storm.html |accessdate=20 April 2020}}</ref>\n}} \n\nThis came to suggest that language influenced the naming of places (similar to gender assignments seen in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] nouns), an example of language constraining our perception of reality. \n\nIn \u2018\u2019Science and Linguistics\u2019\u2019, Whorf stated that:\n\n{{Quote\n|text=\"All observers are not led by the same physical evidence to the same picture of the universe, unless their linguistic backgrounds are similar, or can in some way be calibrated.\" <ref>{{cite web |last1=Whorf |first1=Benjamin Lee |title=Science and Linguistics |url=https://web.mit.edu/allanmc/www/whorf.scienceandlinguistics.pdf |accessdate=20 April 2020}}</ref>\n}} \n\nWhorf\u2019s principle of linguistic relativity was very much used as material for science fiction novels. For example, it appeared in [[Philip Jos\u00e9 Farmer]]\u2019s ''Prometheus'', in which the protagonist, at one point, suggested teaching different groups of aliens different languages, to test the Whorf hypothesis. \n\nAs pointed out by Meyers, \n\n{{Quote\n|text=\"The Whorf hypothesis has a corollary: if it is true that our language determines our perception of reality, then whoever controls language controls the perceptions of reality as well. If language can be controlled. Then would-be despots have available a subtle and efficient means of restricting thought.\" <ref>{{cite book |last1=Meyers |first1=Walter Earl |title=Aliens and linguists: language study and science fiction |date=1980 |publisher=Athens: University of Georgia |page=163 |url=https://archive.org/details/alienslinguists00walt/page/70/mode/1up/search/history |accessdate=20 April 2020 |chapter=10}}</ref>\n}} \n\nThis is explored in [[George Orwell]]\u2019s work, ''[[Nineteen Eighty-four]]''. The novel tells the story of a government that practises [[totalitarianism]], where even thoughts could be considered an offence (see: [[Thoughtcrime]]). [[Newspeak]] was created by the government, which was a much narrower form of English, to limit [[freedom of thought]]. The list of vocabulary grew smaller each year, and the meanings of the words were reduced as well, all to fit into the political goals of the ruling party. \n\n{{Quote\n|text=\"Don\u2019t you see that the whole aim of Newspeak is to narrow the range of thought? In the end we shall make thoughtcrime literally impossible, because there will be no words in which to express it. \u2026 Every year fewer and fewer words, and the range of consciousness always a little smaller. \u2026 The Revolution will be complete when the language is perfect.\" <ref>{{cite book |last1=Orwell |first1=George |title=Nineteen Eighty-four |date=1949 |page=24}}</ref>\n}}\n\nHowever, the Whorf hypothesis could also work to the advantage of human beings. This was seen in [[Jack Vance]]\u2019s ''[[The Languages of Pao]]'', in which the planet Pao was invaded by another planet and the son of the Emperor of Pao was placed on the throne as the invaders\u2019 puppet. The son, Beran Panasper, sought the help of a scientist, Palafox, from another planet, Breakness, to free Pao. As one of Palafox\u2019s sons said:\n\n{{Quote\n|text=\"Think of a language as the contour of a watershed, stopping flow in certain directions, channeling it into others. Language controls the mechanism of your mind. When people speak different languages, their minds work differently and they act differently.\" <ref>{{cite book |last1=Meyers |first1=Walter Earl |title=Aliens and linguists: language study and science fiction |date=1980 |publisher=Athens: University of Georgia |page=166 |url=https://archive.org/details/alienslinguists00walt/page/70/mode/1up/search/history |accessdate=20 April 2020 |chapter=10}}</ref>\n}} \n\nLinguistic Relativity continues to play a large role in the story, where language constrains world-views of the speaker and can be used as a tool to control or liberate the people. \n\n=== Linguistics in Science Fiction after WWII === \n\nScience fiction works after [[World War II#World War II|WWII]] were influenced by the beliefs behind [[Alfred Korzybski]]\u2019s [[General Semantics]]. When Korzybski launched General Semantics as a self-improvement program, [[John W. Campbell Jr.]] promoted its belief system to many widely read science fiction authors and encouraged people to write about it in works of science fiction <ref>{{cite book |last1=Meyers |first1=Walter Earl |title=Aliens and linguists: language study and science fiction |date=1980 |publisher=Athens: University of Georgia |page=171 |url=https://archive.org/details/alienslinguists00walt/page/171/mode/1up/search/history |accessdate=13 April 2020 |chapter=11}}</ref>. This is in spite of the fact that General Semantics has nothing to do with linguistics. As such, science fiction works of this era often contradict actual [[psycholinguistic]] theories. For example, in ''[[The World of Null-A]]'' by [[A. E. van Vogt]] describes language as having the ability to physically alter the human brain in the sense that if a language portrays reality untruthfully, \u201cbrain damage (in the form of sub-microscopic colloidal lesions) results\u201d <ref>{{cite book |last1=Meyers |first1=Walter Earl |title=Aliens and linguists: language study and science fiction |date=1980 |publisher=Athens: University of Georgia |page=173 |url=https://archive.org/details/alienslinguists00walt/page/173/mode/1up/search/history |accessdate=13 April 2020 |chapter=11}}</ref>. This contradicts any and all psycholinguistic descriptions of [[aphasia]], the only language related brain damage. Even in aphasia, language is not the cause, although the loss of language is an effect. \n\n[[General semantics]] has also inspired ''[[Babel-17]]'' by [[Samuel R. Delany]]. In this story, Delany described a character as being incapable of pronouncing /b/ but capable of pronouncing /p/ due to the presence of fangs. This is not a speech impediment that can be caused by having fangs because the two phonemes share the same method of [[Manner of articulation#Manner of articulation|articulation]], they are both bilabial stops. The only thing that is distinct between the two is [[Voice (phonetics)#Voice (phonetics)|voicedness]]; /b/ is voiced while /p/ is unvoiced. Therefore, the only thing that can cause such a speech impediment is damage to the [[vocal cords]]. Even if there is damage to the vocal cords it only makes sense if the resulting speech impediment was an inability to produce a voiced sound due to the inability for the damaged vocal cords to vibrate properly. ''Babel-17'', despite its linguistic errors, was positively received by its readers. In the same book, Delany confuses between [[grammatical gender]] and [[Sex#Sex|sex]]. He has a character lament over how a \u201csex\u201d can be assigned in some languages but not others. This is incongruent with grammatical gender because it is not about sex and it is not a matter of choice whether or not a speaker uses grammatical gender in a language with grammatical gender.\n\nBecause [[general semantics]] has language as a core concern, it was not uncommon for science fiction authors of its time to adopt it as a basis for the different ways they might imagine language to affect the human mind. This can be seen in ''[[Gulf]]'' by [[Robert A. Heinlein]] where [[Speedtalk]] is described to \u201c[make] thought processes enormously faster\u201d <ref>{{cite book |last1=Heinlein |first1=Robert A. |title=Gulf |date=1949 |page=69 |chapter=part 2}}</ref>. In ''[[Gulf]]'', Heinlein described [[Speedtalk]] as being able to express whole sentences in a word. Together, these features were supposed to make the characters of his book more efficient by means of language. Here, science fiction contradicts linguistics for it has been proven that the speed of thought is independent of the length of a verbal utterance <ref>{{cite web |last1=Netsell |first1=Ron |title=What are estimates for the rate of verbal thoughts (thinking with words)? |url=https://www.researchgate.net/post/What_are_estimates_for_the_rate_of_verbal_thought_thinking_with_words |website=ResearchGate |accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref>. Heinlein also made [[Speedtalk]] to have no real distinction between nouns and verbs because he believed that they were not necessary to be logical. In short, [[Speedtalk]] is yet another product of subscription to the [[Sapir-Whorf hypothesis]]; Heinlein believed that providing his characters with a language he claimed was logical would make them incapable of illogical thought.\n\nIn ''[[The Languages of Pao]]'', however [[Jack Vance]] managed to avoided the mistakes that a lot of other science fiction authors have made. At the same time, Vance employs the [[Sapir-Whorf hypothesis]] in his work; he describes the languages of the Paonese people as being capable of altering their minds.\n\n''The Embedding'' by [[Ian Watson (author)|Ian Watson]], however, contains detailed descriptions of many linguistics concepts and theories, with the language experiments Watson wrote about in his book also receiving praise from Meyers. One criticism Meyers had for it was that it was wrong of Watson to think of [[American English]] as \u201ca totally nonexistent dialect\u201d <ref>{{cite book |last1=Meyers |first1=Walter Earl |title=Aliens and linguists: language study and science fiction |date=1980 |publisher=Athens: University of Georgia |page=191 |url=https://archive.org/details/alienslinguists00walt/page/171/mode/1up/search/history |accessdate=13 April 2020 |chapter=11}}</ref>\n\nMany works are often well received despite their erroneous portrayal linguistics. As a result, readers of these works of science fiction are likely to be misinformed <ref>{{cite book |last1=Meyers |first1=Walter Earl |title=Aliens and linguists: language study and science fiction |date=1980 |publisher=Athens: University of Georgia |url=https://archive.org/details/alienslinguists00walt/page/171/mode/1up/search/history |accessdate=13 April 2020 |chapter=11}}</ref> of linguistic facts. Despite this, linguistic concepts and theories are used as a tool in science fiction to \u201c[give readers] important insights into man and his world\u201d <ref>{{cite book |last1=Meyers |first1=Walter Earl |title=Aliens and linguists: language study and science fiction |date=1980 |publisher=Athens: University of Georgia |page=192 |url=https://archive.org/details/alienslinguists00walt/page/171/mode/1up/search/history |accessdate=13 April 2020 |chapter=11}}</ref>. Even in works that try to be as linguistically accurate as possible, there is still a chance of the author making the [[Sapir-Whorf hypothesis]] its central argument in the language of their fictional world.\n\n== Alien Communication ==\n\nWhen dealing with alien languages, the general practice for science fiction, as described by Meyers, was to \u201cmine earlier stories for themes and approaches, frequently making references to what they regard as flaws or virtues in the works of their predecessors\u201d <ref>{{cite book |last1=Meyers |first1=Walter Earl |title=Aliens and linguists: language study and science fiction |date=1980 |publisher=Athens: University of Georgia |page=96 |url=https://archive.org/details/alienslinguists00walt/page/n9/mode/1up/search/history |accessdate=18 April 2020 |chapter=6}}</ref>. As such, it is common for science fiction works to be inspired by one another in terms of linguistics endeavours.\n\nTo have alien language involved in works of science fiction, there has to be contact between humans and extraterrestrial life forms. This is argued by Meyers to be a \u201cstaple\u201d <ref>{{cite book |last1=Meyers |first1=Walter Earl |title=Aliens and linguists: language study and science fiction |date=1980 |publisher=Athens: University of Georgia |page=86 |url=https://archive.org/details/alienslinguists00walt/page/n9/mode/1up/search/history |accessdate=18 April 2020 |chapter=6}}</ref> of science fiction. Despite the linguistic nature of such a task, Meyers laments that \u201cthe job of a linguist is handled by some other specialist\u201d <ref>{{cite book |last1=Meyers |first1=Walter Earl |title=Aliens and linguists: language study and science fiction |date=1980 |publisher=Athens: University of Georgia |page=87 |url=https://archive.org/details/alienslinguists00walt/page/n9/mode/1up/search/history |accessdate=18 April 2020 |chapter=6}}</ref> and in the works he examined, the characters seem to have no qualms with such a choice. There are several works of science fiction that have professionals with no linguistic training to undertake the attempts at communication with aliens. Such examples include professionals like  astronomers, geologists and poets. To some of these choices, Meyers suggests that the success of science fiction communications \u201cmight be the result of sheer good luck\u201d <ref name=\"meyers, pg88\">{{cite book |last1=Meyers |first1=Walter Earl |title=Aliens and linguists: language study and science fiction |date=1980 |publisher=Athens: University of Georgia |page=88 |url=https://archive.org/details/alienslinguists00walt/page/n9/mode/1up/search/history |accessdate=18 April 2020 |chapter=6}}</ref> for characters are often unfamiliar not only with the alien language they are faced, but linguistics as a whole.\n\nIn science fiction, the success in communication with extraterrestrial life forms often involve no attempt at solving the issue of the language barrier between the human characters and the alien characters. Meyers expresses his distaste for such writing in ''Aliens and Linguists: Language Study and Science Fiction'' with:\n\n{{Quote\n|text=\u201cOne does not resolve a contradiction by asserting it\u201d <ref name=\"meyers, pg88\" />\n}}\n\nGenerally, science fiction authors still use such a non-method. One such example is the translation circuit built into the [[TARDIS]] (see: [[Linguistics in Science Fiction#Automatic Translators|Automatic Translators]]) that automatically resolves any language barrier characters face in their space travel.\n\nAt the same time, science fiction is not completely devoid of attempts at solving the issue of language barriers between the different species of science fiction.\n\nIn ''Tetrahedra of Space'', author [[P. Schuyler Miller]] employs sign language as a means of communication between aliens and humans. This is, however, not before having considered other methods such as drawings. A notable attempt from the novel is that the human in the story draws a diagram of the [[Solar System|solar system]] to explain to the alien its [[Heliocentrism|heliocentric]] nature. This method is susceptible to the [[arbitrariness]] of images. This is similar to the criticisms often applied to the [[Pioneer plaque]] that [[Frank Drake]] and [[Carl Sagan]] placed onboard the [[Pioneer 10]] spacecraft. The diagram in the story, much like the diagrams on the Pioneer plaque, can be easily misunderstood by any nonhuman life form that comes across it. In short, the strategy of using images to communicate with aliens in science fiction is not linguistically robust.\n\nAnother point of discussion brought up by Meyers is the question of whether or not aliens even have the sense of sight. The strategy of using images to communicate with aliens would not even be possible, regardless of its arbitrariness, if the intended recipient is not even capable of seeing it. For example, in ''Old Faithful'' by [[Raymond Z. Gallun]], a Martian astronomer detects a morse code message from Earth. Unfortunately for the Martian, not only can he not understand the message, he is deaf and mute and is therefore unfamiliar with neither the concept that sounds are put together to represent meanings in human language, nor that these strings of sound are represented by an [[orthography]] that can be encoded into signals. Throughout the book, Gallun made the Martian learn the messages he receives from Earth despite his disability.\n\nIn ''[[Swords of Mars]]'' of the [[Barsoom]] series, an example praised by Meyers, author [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]] documented a method with which his alien character learns human language that is similar to that used by linguists. In one of the books, the alien character ignores the attempts of communication made by a human character for being too ambiguous. Instead, he points to things in his surroundings and asks the human for a name. This way, he slowly learns some words in English. \n\nIn ''The Winds of Time'' by [[Chad Oliver]], Oliver not only addressed the issue of there being language barrier but also described a method similar to those a linguist might employ when trying to document an unfamiliar language. The alien even goes on to look for [[minimal pairs]] and with his findings, builds an alien equivalent of the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] (IPA). The alien also learns human languages other than English, the majority language of where his ship landed. Oliver, however, glossed over the [[morphology (linguistics)]] and [[syntax]] part of learning a language and chose to summarise the entire process instead. Overall, Meyers praised this book as having \u201c[set] a high standard of excellence for the use of linguistics\u201d <ref>{{cite book |last1=Meyers |first1=Walter Earl |title=Aliens and linguists: language study and science fiction |date=1980 |publisher=Athens: University of Georgia |page=100 |url=https://archive.org/details/alienslinguists00walt/page/n9/mode/1up/search/history |accessdate=18 April 2020 |chapter=6}}</ref>.\n\nThe minority of its kind, ''[[Story of Your Life]]'' by [[Ted Chiang]]  actually has a linguist attempt communication with an alien species that entered the Earth\u2019s atmosphere. The linguistic concept used in the novella was the [[Sapir-Whorf hypothesis]]. The novella is the source material for the 2016 film, ''[[Arrival (film)]]''.\n\n== Deciphering Languages ==\n\nThe concept of unknown languages appears as a recurring theme in many science fiction books that contain alien languages. In some science fiction works, the deciphering of these unknown languages by protagonists of the story follow the linguistic method similar to that used in the decipherment of ancient Egyptian scripts using the [[Rosetta stone]]. This method involves comparing between translations of the same text, where at least one translation is in a known text. As Meyers puts it, \n\n{{Quote\n|text=\u201c...to decipher a dead language one must have some way of getting into the circle, of finding a connection between something inside the system and something outside it.\u201d <ref>{{cite book |last1=Meyers |first1=Walter Earl |title=Aliens and linguists: language study and science fiction |date=1980 |publisher=Athens: University of Georgia |page=39 |url=https://archive.org/details/alienslinguists00walt/page/39 |accessdate=1 April 2020 |chapter=3}}</ref>\n}}\n\nThis method can be seen in science fiction works such as [[Arrival (film)]] in which a part of the deciphering process involved acquiring translations of English sentences in the alien language to compare and decipher meanings. Another method used in the movie was learning the language one word at a time, see: [[Linguistics in Science Fiction#Alien Communication|Alien Communication]]. This is not a recent phenomenon in science fiction, with such ideas appearing even earlier such as in ''[[This Perfect Day]]'' by [[Ira Levin]]. In the story, the world is unified under an oppressive rule with only one language. The protagonist, a nonconformist, later finds books in other foreign languages and attempts to decipher them with limited success, until he finds a book (in French)  with an essay by the founder of the unified world; an essay which already has a translated version available to him in the language he knows. This, in the same way as the Rosetta Stone, helps him decipher the language (French). Some other works involve lesser accidental Rosetta Stones but rather deliberate clues with the explicit intention of helping future populations decipher the language. In such cases, since there is no way of knowing what future communication is like, there is a preference to use illustrations and other instructional material to help future populations learn the unknown language. Such methods can be found in works such as ''The Retreat to Mars'' by [http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/ea.cgi?1797 Cecil B. White]. \n\nOther works of science fiction involving language decipherment are ''[https://www.unz.com/print/ThrillingWonder-1943aug-00049 Expedition]'' by [[Anthony Boucher]] , ''Resurrection/[[The Monster (short story)]]'' by [[A. E. van Vogt]], ''[[Surface Tension (short story)]]'' by [[James Blish]], ''[[The Star (Clarke short story)|The Star]]'' by [[Arthur C. Clarke]], and ''[[Omnilingual]]'' by [[H. Beam Piper]].\n\nWorks that contain more futile efforts of the decipherment of unknown languages include ''The Pastel City'' ([[Viriconium]] Book 1), ''No Jokes on Mars'' by [[James Blish]], and ''Patron of the Arts'' by [[William Rotsler]].\n\n== Language Change ==\n\nScience fiction highlights the common knowledge about language change, which most writers demonstrated to be very little. \n\n=== Historical Change ===\n\n{{Quote\n|text=\u201cScience fiction as a genre, then, has a special relationship within the field of language within the field of language studies to historical linguistics.\u201d <ref name=\"Meyers, page 12\">{{cite book |last1=Meyers |first1=Walter Earl |title=Aliens and linguists: language study and science fiction |date=1980 |publisher=Athens: University of Georgia |page=12 |url=https://archive.org/details/alienslinguists00walt/page/12 |accessdate=27 March 2020 |chapter=2}}</ref>\n}}\n\nAs mentioned by Walter E. Meyers, science fiction is the only genre that enables writers to either foresee the future of the language or the older forms of language, depending on the context of the story <ref name=\"Meyers, page 12\" />. Despite this, many authors failed to realise the importance of linguistics in science fiction, even those with good knowledge of the field. As noted by [[John Krueger]]: \n\n{{Quote\n|text=\u201c...in perhaps one-third or thereabouts of s-f stories, problems of language and communication raise their head, though not always playing a major role.\u201d <ref name=\"Meyers, page 12\" />\n}}\n\nOne example of this can be viewed in the portrayal of [[historical linguistics]]. Historical linguistics entails the study of the older forms of language, and unfortunately, has been one of the lowest priorities in accuracy for science-fiction authors <ref>{{cite book |last1=Meyers |first1=Walter Earl |title=Aliens and linguists: language study and science fiction |date=1980 |publisher=Athens: University of Georgia |page=15 |url=https://archive.org/details/alienslinguists00walt/page/15 |accessdate=28 March 2020 |chapter=2}}</ref>. In some instances linguistic facts were disregarded such as in [[Harvey Jacobs]]\u2019s ''The Egg of the Glak'' <ref>{{cite web |last1=Jacobs |first1=Harvey |title=The Egg of the Glak |url=https://epdf.pub/harvey-jacobs-the-egg-of-the-glak.html |website=epdf |accessdate=3 April 2020}}</ref>, where the [[Great Vowel Shift]] was said to be caused by the [[Norman Conquest]]. In other instances, linguistic changes were misinterpreted such as in [[Larry Niven]]\u2019s ''The Fourth Profession'' <ref>{{cite book |last1=Meyers |first1=Walter Earl |title=Aliens and linguists: language study and science fiction |date=1980 |publisher=Athens: University of Georgia |page=16 |url=https://archive.org/details/alienslinguists00walt/page/16 |accessdate=28 March 2020 |chapter=2}}</ref>. \n\nHowever, there are authors who have employed linguistic change in their works fairly well. [[Philip Jos\u00e9 Farmer]], for instance, conducted extensive research on the forms of English in different historical periods for his series ''[[Riverworld]]'', resulting in consistent accuracies with language change in English. As Meyers points out,\n\n{{Quote\n|text=\u201cIn general the treatment of linguistic change in science fiction is like the sky on a hazy night: a few bright spots seen through an obfuscating fog.\u201d <ref>{{cite book |last1=Meyers |first1=Walter Earl |title=Aliens and linguists: language study and science fiction |date=1980 |publisher=Athens: University of Georgia |page=18 |url=https://archive.org/details/alienslinguists00walt/page/18 |accessdate=30 March 2020 |chapter=2}}</ref>\n}}\n\n=== Evolutionary Change ===\n\nScience fiction authors have had differing views on how language will change in the future. Some believe English will become incomprehensible such as in  [[H. G. Wells]]\u2019s ''[[The Time Machine]]''. Others hypothesize English will be influenced by other languages, as seen in ''[[A Clockwork Orange (novel)]]'' by [[Anthony Burgess]]. There are, however, science fiction authors who choose neither and proclaim English as the \u201cinterstellar lingua franca as it had on Earth\u201d such as in [[Robert Silverberg]]\u2019s ''Schwartz Between the Galaxies'' <ref>{{cite web |last1=Silverberg |first1=Robert |title=Schwartz between the galaxies |url=https://archive.org/details/feastofstdionysu0000silv/page/n1 |website=Internet Archive |accessdate=1 April 2020 |pages=79-104}}</ref>and in [[Arthur C. Clarke]]\u2019s ''[[Childhood's End]]'', in which English is spoken by everyone. In his ''Visions of Tomorrow'', [http://www.sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/samuelson_david_n David Samuelson] noted that many science-fiction authors prefer English as the universal spoken language in their stories <ref>{{cite book |last1=Samuelson |first1=David |title=Visions of Tomorrow |date=1975 |publisher=New York: Arno Press |url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/work/12296108?q&versionId=26107964 |accessdate=3 April 2020}}</ref>. For written English on the other hand, many science-fiction authors perceive a bleak future. This is seen in works such as [[Walter Miller, Jr.]]\u2019s ''[[A Canticle for Leibowitz]]'', in which the people are reduced to illiteracy due to nuclear war. In [[Algis Budrys]]\u2019s ''For Love'' <ref>{{cite web |last1=Budrys |first1=Algis |title=For Love |url=https://archive.org/stream/Galaxy_v20n05_1962-06#page/n9/mode/2up |website=Internet Archive |accessdate=3 April 2020}}</ref>, it is not nuclear war but rather alien invasion that causes this. In other works such as [[Samuel R. Delaney]]\u2019s ''[[Time Considered as a Helix of Semi-Precious Stones]]'' and [[Robert Sheckley]]\u2019s ''Mindswap'' <ref>{{cite web |last1=Sheckley |first1=Robert |title=Mindswap |url=https://archive.org/details/Galaxy_v23n05_1965-06/page/n7/mode/2up/search/mindswap |website=Internet Archive |accessdate=3 April 2020}}</ref>, written English is not completely wiped out but instead reduced to basic English.\n\n{{Quote\n|text=\u201cmost science fiction writers have \u2026. the habit of being extremely slipshod about language\u2026 The time travelers hop three thousand years into the future and find people still speaking idiomatic New York English.

[[Glottochronology]] assumes that a certain amount of basic words in a language will be lost after a thousand years and subsequently <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Gudschinsky |first1=Sarah C. |title=The ABC'S of Lexicostatistics (Glottochronology) |journal=WORD |date=August 1956 |volume=12 |issue=2 |pages=175-210 |doi=10.1080/00437956.1956.11659599 |url=https://doi.org/10.1080/00437956.1956.11659599 |accessdate=2 April 2020}}</ref>. This would mean that the language as we know it now would not be fully similar in the far future. Although, certain writers believed sound recordings would hinder language change, as seen in [[Arthur C. Clarke]]\u2019s ''[[The City and the Stars]]'' <ref>{{cite book |last1=Meyers |first1=Walter Earl |title=Aliens and linguists: language study and science fiction |date=1980 |publisher=Athens: University of Georgia |page=27 |url=https://archive.org/details/alienslinguists00walt/page/27 |accessdate=31 March 2020 |chapter=2}}</ref>.  \n\nHowever, not all writers give a lackluster effort into the future of the language. Science-fiction writers mostly use two methods to demonstrate English of the future: some difference in pronunciation, and the insertion of a few words <ref>{{cite book |last1=Meyers |first1=Walter Earl |title=Aliens and linguists: language study and science fiction |date=1980 |publisher=Athens: University of Georgia |page=29 |url=https://archive.org/details/alienslinguists00walt/page/29 |accessdate=31 March 2020 |chapter=2}}</ref>. The former can be seen in [[Bruce McAllister]]\u2019s ''Benji\u2019s Pencil'' <ref>{{cite web |last1=McAllister |first1=Bruce |title=Benji's Pencil |url=https://archive.org/stream/Fantasy_Science_Fiction_v036n03_1969-03_PDF/Fantasy__Science_Fiction_v036n03_1969-03_PDF_djvu.txt |website=Internet Archive |accessdate=3 April 2020}}</ref>, where English is described as sounding like \u201cnasalised English, chopped but softer than German\u201d 200 years into the future. The inclusion of new words comprise of either forming new words, such as \u201cgoffin\u201d  in [[James Blish]]\u2019s ''[[A Work of Art]]'', or using old words in a new sense such as in [[Samuel R. Delaney]]\u2019s ''The Star Pit'' <ref>{{cite web |last1=Delaney |first1=Samuel R. |title=The Star Pit |url=https://archive.org/details/samuelrdelanythestarpit04/Samuel_R_Delany-The_Star_Pit-01+WBAI.mp3 |website=Internet Archive |accessdate=3 April 2020}}</ref>, in which the word \u201cgolden\u201d is used as a term referring to the only ones capable of withstanding the mental stress of piloting an intergalactic craft. \n\nSuch assumptions on the evolution of language in science fiction might be helpful in predicting the future of language in reality as seen in an undertaking by Peter Stockwell <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Stockwell |first1=Peter |title=Futuretalk: one small step towards a Chronolinguistics |journal=Nottingham Linguistic Circular |date=2000 |volume=15 |pages=55-68}}</ref>. \n\nAll in all, the state of language change in science fiction may be summarized well by the following excerpt from ''Aliens and Linguists: Language Study and Science Fiction'' by Walter E. Meyers <ref name=\"Meyers, pg36-27\">{{cite book |last1=Meyers |first1=Walter Earl |title=Aliens and linguists: language study and science fiction |date=1980 |publisher=Athens: University of Georgia |pages=36-37 |url=https://archive.org/details/alienslinguists00walt/page/36 |accessdate=2 April 2020 |chapter=2}}</ref>:\n\n{{Quote\n|text=\u201c...science fiction is a window not into the future but into the present: in its stories we see what the writers know about language in general and historical linguistics in particular.\u201d <ref name=\"Meyers, pg36-27\" />\n}}\n\n== Learning Alien Language ==\n\nAlthough works of science fiction throughout history have employed different methods of learning alien language, their methods of language learning are not the standard. According to [[Walter E. Meyers]] in ''Aliens and Linguists: Language Study and Science Fiction'', short stories were common in science fiction works of the time. This meant that for the sake of storytelling, authors usually had no room for extended descriptions on the process of language learning. When the process of language learning is described, it is usually not a central concern; some authors might try to document the process but most others would ignore it altogether. As Beverly Friend pointed out, having aliens learn human language rather than the opposite was a popular strategy <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Friend |first1=Beverly |title=Strange Bedfellows: Science Fiction Linguistics & Education |journal=The English Journal |date=October 1973 |volume=62 |issue=7 |pages=998-1003 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/813614?seq=1}}</ref>. When human characters do learn alien languages, it is commonly done through the strategies listed below:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Method of Learning\n! Description\n! Appearing works\n|-\n| Hypnosis\n| Popular method after WWII.\n| ''[[Vril#Vril|The Coming Race (1871)]]'' by [[Edward Bulwer-Lytton]]\n|-\n| Neural changes\n| Language skills treated as encoded data.\n| ''The Linguist (1975)'' by [[Stephen Robinett#Stephen Robinett|Tak Hallus]]\n|-\n| Sleep-learning\n| Characters learn an unfamiliar language in their sleep.\n| ''Sweet Helen'' by Charles W.

Sources, from which journals are found, include [[National Geographic]], [[Science Magazine]], and [[Science News-Letter|Science News-letter]], under the categories of learning and memory, rather than linguistics journals.\n\nSome authors might make it such that a character required to learn a language is naturally skilled at doing so. Such characters are usually super-humanly efficient language learners. One such example is [[John Carter of Mars#John Carter of Mars|John Carter]], a character in [[Edgar Rice Burrough]]\u2019s ''[[Barsoom]]'' series. Similar to this strategy, other authors make the unfamiliar language simple to learn; one such example can be seen in ''[[Across the Zodiac]]'' by [[Percy Greg]]. Despite Greg\u2019s description of the language as simple, the structure of the language is still that of an [[Indo-European language]]. This makes the language only simple to the author whose very own language is Indo-European. When languages are simple, [[John Krueger]] <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Krueger |first1=John R. |title=Language and Techniques of Communication as Theme or Tool in Science-Fiction |journal=Linguistics: An International Review |date=1968 |volume=39 |pages=68-86}}</ref> argues that authors cannot resist the temptation of making it difficult in some aspect of language. Although, difficulty in phonology can be justified considering alien anatomy.\n\nThere are still authors who do away with the need for language learning altogether. For example, in ''Doorway in the Sand'' by [[Roger Zelazny]], Zelazny introduced an interpreter to resolve the language barrier between his human and alien characters . This way, he circumvented the need for any language learning process. (Related to: [[Linguistics in Science Fiction#Alien Communication|Alien Communication]]) \n\nIn his book, Meyers wrote that authors have a preconceived notion that language learning is hard and even labelled ''Childhood\u2019s End'' by [[Arthur C. Clarke]] as being overrated for equating language learning to the construction of the pyramids.\n\n== Language Medium ==\n\nWith invented species, aliens, and other such characters in science fiction comes not only constructed languages but also new mediums using which these characters speak. As Meyers points out:\n\n{{Quote\n|text=\u201c... the science fiction writer frequently invents both the message and the medium.\u201d <ref>{{cite book |last1=Meyers |first1=Walter Earl |title=Aliens and linguists: language study and science fiction |date=1980 |publisher=Athens: University of Georgia |page=69 |url=https://archive.org/details/alienslinguists00walt/page/69/mode/1up/search/history |accessdate=10 April 2020 |chapter=5}}</ref>\n}}\n\n=== Auditory (Sound)===\n\nA common medium of communication employed by science fiction authors is the familiar one of vocal-auditory used by humans. In order to make this more exotic and suited to the alien theme of the story, some writers choose to tweak the method of producing this medium of communication. This could come in the form of a difference in physiology or structure of the alien as seen in [[Isaac Asimov]]\u2019s ''[[Hostess]]''. In his story, Asimov\u2019s alien is described as having a different mouth structure to a human, although his speech sounds similar to that of a human on Earth:\n\n{{Quote\n|text=\u201cThe construction of his mouth, combined with an absence of incisors , gave a whistling sound to the sibilants. Aside from that, he might have been born on Earth for all the accent his speech showed.\u201d <ref>{{cite book |last1=Asimov |first1=Isaac |title=The Complete Stories |date=1951 |page=354}}</ref>\n}}\n\n[[Gordon R. Dickson]] describes just as much in his work ''The Christmas Present'' (see: [[The Star Road]]), with the jellyfish-like alien described as having a voice that was:\n\n{{Quote\n|text=\u201c...croaky and unbeautiful, for a constricted air-sac is not built for the manufacture of human words.\u201d <ref>{{cite book |last1=Dickson |first1=Gordon R. |title=The Christmas Present |date=1973 |page=83}}</ref>\n}}\n\n[[John Brunner]] also goes into detail about the method of sound production of his aliens in his work ''The Dramaturges of Yan'', writing that the aliens had lungs at their sides,\n\n{{Quote\n|text=\u201c...drawing in air directly through spiracles between the ribs; like bagpipes, they had continual through-put. Sound to talk with was generated by a tympanal membrane and relayed through resonating chambers in the gullet, giving a rather pleasant, if not monotonous, timbre; in Kaydad\u2019s case, resembling a cello droning away on a single note\u2026\u201d <ref>{{cite book |last1=Brunner |first1=John |title=The Dramaturges of Yan |date=1972 |page=44}}</ref>\n}}\n\n[[Cyril M. Kornbluth]] uses a rather different method from these in his work ''Friend to Man'' (see: ''[[The Explorers (collection)]]''), in which the alien resembles a cello in the way it produces sound and not just in the way it sounds. This method of producing sound is described in the following excerpt of an interaction between the alien and a man named Smith who was rescued by the alien:\n\n{{Quote\n|text=\u201c\"Salt?\" asked Smith, his voice thin in the thin air. \u201cI need salt with water.\u201d\nThe thing rubbed two appendages together and he saw a drop of amber exude and spread on them. It was, he realised a moment later, rosining the bow, for the appendages drew across each other and he heard a whining, vibrating cricket voice say: \u201cS-s-z-z-aw-w?\u201d\nIt did better the next time. The amber drop spread, and \u201cS-z-aw-t?\u201d was sounded, with a little tap of the bow for the final phoneme.\u201d <ref>{{cite book |last1=Kornbluth |first1=Cyril M. |title=Friend to Man |date=1951 |page=243}}</ref>\n}}\n\nThis theme of aliens producing sound in a way similar to a musical instrument (and perhaps physically resembling one as well) is continued by [[James Blish]] in his work ''This Earth of Hours''. In the story, the aliens are known as \u201cCall\u00ebans\u201d and the character, 12-UpJohn, discovers how they speak, saying:\n\n{{Quote\n|text=\u201c... the sounds issued at low volume from a multitude of spiracles or breath-holes all along the body, each hole producing only one pure tone, the words and intonations being formed in mid-air by intermodulation - a miracle of co-ordination among a multitude of  organs obviously unsuitable for sound-forming at all.\u201d <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Blish |first1=James |title=This Earth of Hours |journal=The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction |date=June 1959 |page=12}}</ref>\n}}\n\nThe theme of musical communication has appeared in science fiction as early as 1638 in [[Francis Godwin]]\u2019s work ''[[The Man in the Moone]]''. It also appeared in [[Winfred P. Lehmann]]\u2019s ''Decoding of the Martian Language''. Since W. P. Lehmann is a linguist, his story was explained in far greater scientific detail than most other science fiction authors.\n\nWhen it comes to the auditory medium, however, there is also communication at frequencies above and below that of what is audible to humans. For example, in [[Henry Kuttner]]\u2019s ''The Big Night'', the aliens communicate using frequencies below what is audible to humans (subsonics) and wear a device to increase this frequency to one that is audible to humans when communicating with them. In ''[[Mission of Gravity]]'' by [[Hal Clement]], the alien is able to communicate in both a frequency higher than what is perceived by humans and a frequency perceivable by humans. The aliens in ''[[In a Good Cause\u2014]]'' by [[Isaac Asimov]] had similar abilities, having a specialised organ for the higher frequencies and a separate one for frequencies audible to humans. \n\nMore science fiction stories involving the vocal-auditory medium as a means of communication include ''[[Proxima Centauri (short story)]]'' by [[Murray Leinster]], ''[[Arrival (film)]]'' (although the aliens in ''Arrival'' had two mediums of communication, one vocal-auditory and the other through visuals), and in ''[[Star Trek]],'' where alien communication is prevalent.\n\n=== Visual (Sight) ===\n\nThe second most popular choice of language medium in science fiction is the visual medium or sight. One such story using this medium is ''[[Venus on the Half-Shell]]'' by Kilgore Trout ([[Philip Jos\u00e9 Farmer]]), in which the aliens used their limbs to make signs in order to communicate:\n\n{{Quote\n|text=\u201c\u201cWhat do they talk with?\u201d Simon said to Chworktap.\n\t\u201cThey use their fingers, just like deaf-and-dumb people.\u201d\n\u2026 Their arms came out, the fingers wriggling and crossing and bending as they asked each other what in the hell these strangers were and what did they mean to do?\u201d <ref>{{cite book |last1=Farmer |first1=Philip Jos\u00e9 |title=Venus on the Half-Shell |date=1975 |page=101}}</ref>\n}}\n\n[[James Blish]] also explored the use of visual medium in communication in his work ''VOR''. In the story, the alien communicated using colour-shifts in the light spectrum (displayed colours on the front of its head). Similar to this was the aliens in [[Rex Gordon]]\u2019s ''First on Mars/[[No Man Friday]]'', in which the aliens (as big as freight trains) also communicated using light with the main character remarking \u201c...there simply has not been on Earth such a colloquy of light.\u201d <ref>{{cite book |last1=Gordon |first1=Rex |title=No Man Friday |date=1956 |page=158}}</ref>. In ''[[What Is This Thing Called Love? (short story)]]'' by [[Isaac Asimov]], the aliens also communicated through colour, using color patches that changed hue to communicate. In ''Death and Designation Among the Asadi'' by [[Michael Bishop (author)]], Bishop describes in detail a similar form of communication:\n\n{{Quote\n|text=\u201cAs for the staring matches, they\u2019re of brief duration and involve fierce gesticulation and mane-shaking. In these head-to-head confrontations the eyes change colour with astonishing rapidity, flashing through the entire visible spectrum -and maybe beyond- in a matter of seconds.\n\tI am now prepared to say that these instantaneous changes of eye color are the Asadi equivalent of speech\u2026\u201d <ref>{{cite book |last1=Bishop |first1=Michael |title=Death and Designation Among the Asadi |date=January 1973 |page=175}}</ref>\n}}\n\n=== Olfactory (Smell)===\n\nAlthough much more challenging to employ, smell has also been used as a medium of communication by science fiction authors. In ''Doomship'' by [[Frederik Pohl]] and [[Jack Williamson]], the aliens (T\u2019worlies) communicate through smells. As noticed by a human character in the story, \n\n{{Quote\n|text=\u201cThe vinegary smell deepened. It was a sign of polite cogitation in a T\u2019worlie, like a human being\u2019s hmmm\u201d <ref>{{cite book |author-last1=Pohl |author-first1=Frederik |author-last2=Williamson |author-first2=Jack |title=Doomship |date=1973 |page=42}}</ref>\n|author=|title=|source=}}\n\nSimilar to this method of communication is one employed the alien species in ''Cabin Boy'' (see ''[[Far Out (book)]]'') by [[Damon Knight]]. In this story, two humans attempt to communicate with the alien that uses scent, although this proves rather difficult:\n\n{{Quote\n|text=\u201c...there had been a series of separate odors, all unfamiliar and all overpoweringly strong. At least a dozen of them, Roget thought; they had gone past too quickly to count.\u201d <ref>{{cite book |last1=Knight |first1=Damon |title=Far Out |date=1951 |chapter=Cabin Boy}}</ref>\n}}\n\nAs Meyers points out, however, the challenge in \u201c...using air-borne scents for communication is that even a casual breeze becomes \u201cnoise\u201d in the system, blending odors and distorting their original sequence.\u201d <ref>{{cite book |last1=Meyers |first1=Walter Earl |title=Aliens and linguists: language study and science fiction |date=1980 |publisher=Athens: University of Georgia |page=80 |url=https://archive.org/details/alienslinguists00walt/page/69/mode/1up/search/history |accessdate=12 April 2020 |chapter=5}}</ref>. Then again, [[Colin Kapp]] overcomes this problem in his work ''The Old King\u2019s Answers'', in which the one character describes the aliens as having:\n\n{{Quote\n|text=\u201c...scent glands in the pads of their feet\u2026 They\u2019ve settled on the flat faces of the crystal rocks when they really want to leave a message for the world.\u201d <ref name=\"old king's answers, pg167\">{{cite book |last1=Kapp |first1=Colin |title=The Old King's Answers |date=1973 |page=167}}</ref>\n}}\n\nThe character further goes on to explain:\n\n{{Quote\n|text=\u201cUsing chromatography, I\u2019ve managed to identify three individual scent products, all of them remarkably persistent. They are combined together on the crystal faces in an amazing spectrum of complexity. In their scent-writing they have the capacity -though I\u2019m not sure how much of it they utilize- to compress more bits of information in a given space than we humans can in our optical writing.\u201d <ref name=\"old king's answers, pg167\" />\n}}\n\nThis medium of smell was also utilised by [[John Norman]] in his work ''Priest-Kings of Gor'' (Book 3 of ''[[Gor]]''), in which the medium is not only described but the advantages and disadvantages of it is also discussed. In the story, the narrator describes the medium, saying:\n\n{{Quote\n|text=\u201cWhat in the passageways I had taken to be the scent of Priest-Kings had actually been the residue of odor-signals which Priest-Kings, like certain social insects of our world, use in communicating with one another.\u201d <ref>{{cite book |last1=Norman |first1=John |title=Priest-Kings of Gor |date=1968 |page=77}}</ref>\n}}\n\nThe narrator then goes on to discuss in length the advantageous and disadvantageous of such a medium:\n\n{{Quote\n|text=\u201cCommunication by odor-signals can in certain circumstances be extremely efficient, though it can be disadvantageous in others. For example, an odor can carry\u2026 much farther than can the shout or cry of a man to another man. Moreover, if not too much time is allowed to elapse, a Priest-King may leave a message in his chamber or in a corridor for another Priest-King, and the other may arrive later and interpret. A disadvantage of this mode of communication, of course, is that the message may be understood by strangers or by others for whom it is not intended. One must be careful of what one says in the tunnels of the Priest-Kings for one\u2019s words may linger after one, until they sufficiently dissipate to be little more than a meaningless blur of scent.\u201d <ref>{{cite book |last1=Norman |first1=John |title=Priest-Kings of Gor |date=1968 |page=78}}</ref>\n}}\n\nSince Norman placed his setting in \u201ctunnels\u201d, he rid himself of any problems posed by winds. A similar approach was taken by [[Hal Clement]] in his work ''[[Uncommon Sense]]'', in which he had gotten rid of air altogether by assuming his setting to be an airless planet.\n\n=== Kinesics (Movement/Gestures)===\n\nAs explained by Meyers, gestures\n\n{{Quote\n|text=\u201c...are as arbitrary in their meanings as any spoken word: they depend for their intelligibility on the prior agreement by the members of the community.\u201d <ref>{{cite book |last1=Meyers |first1=Walter Earl |title=Aliens and linguists: language study and science fiction |date=1980 |publisher=Athens: University of Georgia |page=82 |url=https://archive.org/details/alienslinguists00walt/page/70/mode/1up/search/history |accessdate=12 April 2020 |chapter=5}}</ref>\n}}\n\nThis code-like aspect of gestures is seen in science fiction stories involving [[kinesics]] as a medium for language. One such example of this is seen in ''Orn'' (Book 2 of ''[[Of Man and Manta]]'') by [[Piers Anthony]]. In this story, \u201cmanta-shaped flying fungoids\u201d used kinesics for communication in that they snapped their tails once for \u2018yes\u2019 and twice for \u2018no\u2019 when communicating with humans. This code eventually evolved and allowed the fungoids to initiate conversation, \u201cwith that combination of gesture and tail snaps they had gradually worked out as their code\u201d <ref>{{cite book |last1=Anthony |first1=Piers |title=Orn |date=1970 |page=147}}</ref>.\n\nIn some cases, however, [[kinesics]] was not employed as a medium of communication on its own but together with other mediums. For example, in ''The Dance of the Changer and the Three'' by [[Terry Carr]], the aliens called \"Loarrans\" communicated via \u201cwave-dancing\u201d, which seemed in part an art form rather than just communication:\n\n{{Quote\n|text=\u201cThe dance he went through to give the description was intricate and even imaginative\u2026 It used motion and color and sound and another sense something like smell.\u201d <ref>{{cite book |last1=Carr |first1=Terry |title=The Dance of the Changer and the Three |date=1968}}</ref> \n}}\n\nIn the case of the \"Nildoror\", aliens in ''[[Downward to the Earth]]'' by [[Robert Silverberg]], they had no limbs that they were able to use to gesture (having walked on all fours). Hence, they had other appendages to do so. As the narrator explains:\n\n{{Quote\n|text=\u201cThe spiny crest down the middle of the alien\u2019s broad skull began to twitch\u2026 The nildoror had a rich language of gesture, employing not only the spines but also their long ropy trunks and their many-pleated ears,\u201d <ref>{{cite book |last1=Silverberg |first1=Robert |title=Downward to the Earth |date=1970 |pages=8-9}}</ref>  \n}}\n\nThere are also some science fiction works that include tactile ([[touch]]) as a medium of communication. These include works such as ''[[Memoirs of a Spacewoman]]'' by [[Naomi Mitchison]], and ''[[The Word for World is Forest]]'' by [[Ursula K. Le Guin]].\n\n== Machines & Language ==\n\n=== Machine Speech ===\n\nMachines have been another popular theme in science fiction works, appearing in works like ''[[I, Robot (film)]]'', ''[[Ex Machina (film)]]'' , ''[[Chappie (film)]]'', ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey]]'', and even much older works such as ''[[The Moon is a Harsh Mistress]]'' by [[Robert A. Heinlein]]. In such works, machines are portrayed with the ability to speak just as well or even better than humans. This ability is almost always explained from the perspective of computer programming as was done in ''The Moon is a Harsh Mistress'', although it has just as much to do with linguistics, especially in order to sound natural enough to be indistinguishable from a regular human. \n\n[[Speech synthesis]] occurring in science fiction works can be categorised into two forms. The first form is synthesised speech, which is completely produced by the machine itself and is the form of speech synthesis portrayed by Robert A. Heinlein in ''The Moon is a Harsh Mistress''. The second form appearing in science fiction works is one in which stored pre-recorded bits of human speech are assembled by the machine to form speech <ref name=\"Meyers pg 45\">{{cite book |last1=Meyers |first1=Walter Earl |title=Aliens and linguists: language study and science fiction |date=1980 |publisher=Athens: University of Georgia |page=45 |url=https://archive.org/details/alienslinguists00walt/page/45/mode/2up |accessdate=5 April 2020 |chapter=3}}</ref>. This form of machine-generated speech appeared in works such as ''[[Autofac]]'' by [[Philip K. Dick]], in which speech produced by the machine is void of any intonations or other prosody. \n\nIn more recent works, such as ''[[I, Robot (film)|I, Robot]]'' , ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'', and even the [[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]] trilogy ([[J.A.R.V.I.S.]]), machines are portrayed as having speech that sounds just as natural as that of a regular human. In ''The Machine'' by [[John W. Campbell]] (from ''The Best of John W. Campbell''), the machine-produced voice was described as being \u201c...peculiarly commanding, a superhuman voice of perfect clarity and perfect resonance. It was commanding, attracting, yet pleasant.\u201d. This manner of human-like speech can also be seen in ''You\u2019ll take the High Road'' by [[John Brunner (novelist)|John Brunner]] (from ''Three Trips in Time and Space'') and ''[[Galactic Pot-Healer]]'' by [[Philip K. Dick]]. Ira Levin has also utilised the idea of fluent human-like speech in his science fiction work ''[[The Stepford Wives]]'', in which human-like androids are made to replace mens\u2019 wives after they have been murdered by their husbands. The androids, needing to be perfect copies of the women, use machine-generated voices that gain their vocabulary from recordings of the women\u2019s actual voices.\n\nHowever, in many other works, machine speech was used to portray \u201chuman depersonalisation\u201d. In ''Promises to Keep: A Science Fiction Drama'' from ''Alien Horizons'' by [[William F. Nolan]], Nolan described the computerised ship\u2019s voice as \u201cmetallic, emotionless\u201d <ref name=\"Meyers pg 45\" />. This portrayal could be traced back to even older works such as ''The Last Evolution'' <ref>{{cite web |author1=John W. Campbell, Jr. |title=The Last Evolution |url=https://www.gutenberg.org/files/27462/27462-h/27462-h.htm |website=Project Gutenberg |accessdate=5 April 2020 |archivedate=December 2008}}</ref> by John W. Campbell in which machine speech is described as\n\n{{Quote\n|text=\u201c...the vibrationally correct, emotionless tones of all the race of machines.\u201d \n}}\n\nOther work involving this theme of depersonalisation includes works such as ''[[It's Such a Beautiful Day]]'' by [[Isaac Asimov]], ''[[The Quest for Saint Aquin]]'' by Anthony Boucher, ''The Hawks of Arcturus'' by Cecil Snyder, ''I, the Unspeakable'' <ref>{{cite web |author1=Walter J. Sheldon |title=I, the Unspeakable |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51210 |website=Project Gutenberg |accessdate=5 April 2020}}</ref> by Walter J. Sheldon<ref>{{cite web |title=Walter J. Sheldon |url=https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_J._Sheldon |website=Wikip\u00e9dia |accessdate=6 April 2020 |language=French}}</ref>, and ''[[The Ship Who Sang]]'' by [[Anne McCaffrey]].\n\nGiven the scientific capabilities to add prosody to machine-generated speech, Walter E. Meyers was critical of this use of emotionless machine speech in science fiction works, as shown from the following excerpt:\n\n{{Quote\n|text=\u201c...the problems of adding pitch, stress, and juncture (the transitions between words and phrases) to machine-produced speech were mastered well before William F. Nolan wrote the passage\u2026 Writers who now speak of emotionless mechanical voices do so either through ignorance or, more probably, because they value the symbolism involved more highly than scientific accuracy.\u201d \n}}\n\nMore works utilising the general theme of machine speech are ''Jamboree'' by [[Jack Williamson]], ''Becalmed in Hell'' <ref>{{cite web |author1=Larry Niven |title=Becalmed in Hell |url=https://www.baen.com/Chapters/9781481483605/9781481483605___6.htm |website=Space Pioneers |accessdate=5 April 2020}}</ref> by Larry Niven, ''Starchild'' by [[Frederik Pohl]] and [[Jack Williamson]] (part of the ''[[Starchild Trilogy]]''), ''Evane (1973)'' by [[E.C. Tubb]], and ''Stranger Station'' by [[Damon Knight]].\n\n=== Automatic Translators ===\n\nIn many works of science fiction with language as part of the plot, the idea of automatic translators has been frequently brought up <ref name=\"meyers, pg 119\">{{cite book |last1=Meyers |first1=Walter Earl |title=Alien and linguists: language study and science fiction |date=1980 |publisher=Athens: University of Georgia |page=119 |url=https://archive.org/details/alienslinguists00walt/page/119/mode/2up |accessdate=6 April 2020 |chapter=8}}</ref>. These translators can be split into two main types: translators translating from a known language to another known language, and those translating from an unknown language to a known language. \n\nWalter E. Meyers noted that translators of the first kind (known-to-known) were usually small devices, \u201c...typically worn as a pendent or pinned to the shirt\u201d <ref name=\"meyers, pg 119\" />. This can be seen in ''Jackal\u2019s Meal'' (collected in ''[[The Star Road]]'') by [[Gordon R. Dickson]]. Such a device also appeared in ''A Little Knowledge'' by [[Poul Anderson]], in which a small device worn on the chest and called a \u2018Vocalizer\u2019 translated English into the known language of aliens. More works involving this type of automatic translators include ''The Brains of Earth'' by [[Jack Vance]].\n\nThe second type of translator (unknown-to-known) seems to appear more often in science fiction works and can be alternatively known as a \u201c[[Universal Translator]]\u201d. In ''I\u2019ll Be Waiting for You When the Swimming Pool is Empty'' by [[James Tiptree Jr.]], the protagonist uses a universal translator called the \u2018Omniglot Mark Eight Vocoder\u2019 that instantly translates whatever is being said to the necessary alien language although the characters themselves do not know what language that is. \n\nThe universal translator also makes multiple appearances in science fiction movies and shows. In ''[[Men in Black (1997 film)|Men in Black]]'' [[Men in Black (1997 film)|(1997 film)]], a universal translator is introduced during the tour of the MIB headquarters. In ''[[Star Trek]]'', a Universal Translator is frequently used to translate alien languages into known languages of the user. ''[[Doctor Who]]'' also played with the idea of a universal translator, with the universal translator being part of the [[TARDIS]]. This recurring theme of universal translators being part of a ship or mode of transport was also seen in ''[[Ringworld]]'' by Larry Niven.\n\nContrary to this theme, works such as ''[[Inconstant Moon#\"How the Heroes Die\"|\"How the Heroes Die\",]]'' also by Larry Niven, and ''Unhuman Sacrifice'' by [[Katherine Maclean]] portrayed the universal translator as a less portable, more fixed-in-place computer. Even further from this theme are works such as ''[[The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy]]'', in which the universal translator is not in the form of a machine at all. In ''The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy'', the universal translator exists instead as a \u2018babel fish\u2019 that is inserted into the ear.\n\n== Animals and Language ==\n\nScience fiction plots concerning animals and language can to an extent be divided into two main themes, the first being the popular theme of teaching animals to produce human speech, and the second being the less popular theme of learning the language of the animals themselves.\n\n=== Teaching Animals Human Languages ===\n\nAs Meyers puts it, \u201cWe have long felt the desire, even the need, to speak to the creatures around us, which parrots and the like do little to satisfy\u201d<ref name=\":0\" />. A great example of such a desire is seen from the ''[[Planet of the Apes]]'' movie franchise. This desire is also explored by older works such as [[Clifford D Simak]]\u2019s ''Census'', one of the tales appearing in his work ''[[City (novel)#City (novel)|City]]''. In the story, a character named Bruce Webster surgically alters dogs to give them the ability to speak. [[Harlan Ellison]] also explores a similar theme in his work ''[[A Boy and His Dog]], in which ''a dog named \u201cBlood\u201d is capable of speech, speaking perhaps even better than his human, Vic. Blood, however, speaks through telepathy rather than actual outspoken speech (see: [[Linguistics in Science Fiction#Telepathy|Telepathy]]).  \n\nAnother instance similar to Blood but involving communicating out loud is the horse from ''Dream Done Green'' by [[Alan Dean Foster]]. In the story, the human character Micah Schell discovers a hormone that is capable of enabling higher mammals to have the mental abilities of at least a human 10-year-old. One horse, however, far exceeds this and is capable of speaking 18 languages, with the sound of his speech being described as:\n\n{{Quote\n|text=\"a mellow tenor that tended to rise on concluding syllables, only to break and drop like a whitecap on the sea before the next word.\" <ref>{{cite book |last1=Foster |first1=Alan Dean |title=Dream Done Green |date=1974 |page=4}}</ref>\n}}\n\nScience fiction authors dealing with this theme of animals capable of human speech mostly suggest a physical change that allows animals to have the capacity for human speech, especially considering the differences in sound production through the [[vocal tract]] between animals and humans. One writer that explicitly states this physical change is [[James H. Schmitz]] in his work ''[[The Demon Breed]]''. In this story, Sweeting, one of three 7.5 foot otters capable of speech is described as being \u201ca product of a geneticist\u2019s miscalculation\u201d. The ancestors of Sweeting are said to have been \n\n{{Quote\n|text=\"... a development of a preserved Teran otter strain, tailored for an oceanic existence. The coastal rancher who\u2019d brought the consignment was startled some months later when the growing cubs began to address him in a slurrily chopped-up version [of his language].\" <ref>{{cite book |last1=Schmitz |first1=James H. |title=The Demon Breed |date=1968 |page=50}}</ref>\n}}\n\nWhile such cases of genetic mutation have been used as a common mechanism to explain changes enabling animals to execute human speech production, some authors of science fiction at times do not use it correctly. For example, in the case of ''[[The Blue Giraffe]]'' by [[L. Sprague de Camp]], the offspring of baboons mutated through exposure to radiation are described to have physically altered only in size and yet were able to speak in [[Xhosa language#Xhosa language|Xhosa]] that was taught to them by a ranger in the wildlife preserve they inhabited. As Meyers noted of de Camp\u2019s writing,\n\n{{Quote\n|text=\"Computer simulation of primate vocal range was unknown when de Camp wrote, of course, but there had been indications, even in science fiction itself, that without changes in bone structure and musculature, the baboons could not have mastered the phonology of Xhosa or any other human language.\" <ref>{{cite book |last1=Meyers |first1=Walter Earl |title=Aliens and linguists: language study and science fiction |date=1980 |publisher=Athens: University of Georgia |page=56 |url=https://archive.org/details/alienslinguists00walt/page/171/mode/1up/search/history |accessdate=14 April 2020 |chapter=4}}</ref>\n}}\n\nA good example of a detailed explanation into human speech production in primates can be seen in ''Pithecanthropus Rejectus'' by [[Manly Wade Wellman]]. In the story, Wellman details the problems faced by the character, an ape, in human speech production as well as how it was overcome by \u201cthe Doctor\u201d, another character in the story.\n\n{{Quote\n|text=\"As I learned to speak and to comprehend, I found out the cause of those pains. I was told by the tall, smiling blond woman who taught me to call her \u2018Mother\u2019. She explained that I had been born with no opening in the top of my skull - so needed for bone and brain expansion - and that the man of the house - \u2018Doctor\u2019 - had made such an opening governing the growth of my cranium and later stopping the hole with a silver plate. My jaw, too, had been altered with silver, for when I was born it had been too shallow and narrow to give my tongue play. The building of a chin for me and the remodeling of several tongue-muscles had made it possible for me to speak.\" <ref>{{cite book |last1=Wellman |first1=Manly Wade |title=Pithecanthropus Rejectus |date=1938 |page=423}}</ref>\n}}\n\nAnother method used by science fiction writers to introduce physical changes enabling human speech production in non-human animals is genetic engineering. This method appeared in ''Doomship'' by [[Frederik Pohl]] and [[Jack Williamson]]. In the story, Pohl and Williamson also describe the challenges involved in human speech production by non-human animals:\n\n{{Quote\n|text=\"A chimpanzee is simply not human. His physiology is one count against him. He cannot develop the brain of a human being because his skull is the wrong shape - and because the chemistry of his blood does not carry enough nourishment to meet the demands of abstract thought. He cannot fully master speech because he lacks the physical equipment to form the wide variety of phonemes in human language. The molecular-biology people knew how to deal with that. They could do things like widening the angle of the cranium called the kyphosis, thus allowing the brain to round out full frontal lobes, or restructuring tongue and palate, even adding new serum components to the blood like the alpha2 globulins that bind human hemoglobin.\" <ref>{{cite book |author-last1=Pohl |author-first1=Frederik |author-last2=Williamson |author-first2=Jack |title=Doomship |date=1973 |page=58}}</ref> \n}}\n\n=== Humans Learning Animal Languages ===\n\nWhen it comes to the less popular and much rarer theme of humans learning the languages of the animals, there are only few examples present in science fiction works. Known examples would include the following: \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Title and Author \n!Plot Summary\n|-\n|''The Bees of Knowledge'' by [[Barrington J. Bayley]]\n|The main character attempts to communicate (unsuccessfully) with giant alien bees who hold him captive using knowledge of bee communication on Earth. \n|-\n|''Interface'' by [[A. A. Attanasio]]\n|An investigator raises a boy and dolphin together from childhood in attempts to have communication between them both\n|-\n|''People of the Sea / [[Dolphin Island (novel)]]'' by [[Arthur C. Clarke]] \n|A device is built for communication between humans and dolphins\n|} \n\nIn Clarke\u2019s story, however, the device, resembling an over-sized wrist watch, would convert pre-selected words (appearing as buttons on the device) into the language of dolphins. This does not really involve learning the animal language itself but rather relies on a translation device (Related to [[Linguistics in Science Fiction#Automatic Translators|Automatic Translators]]). Although, this does imply that the animal language has already been decoded and learnt, especially for the translator to actually work.\n\n== Telepathy ==\n\n[[Telepathy]] has been a recurring [[motif (narrative)]] in science fiction stories, for the most part being used as a convenient tool to bypass linguistic problems that writers encounter <ref>{{cite book |last1=Meyers |first1=Walter Earl |title=Aliens and linguists: language study and science fiction |date=1980 |publisher=Athens: University of Georgia |page=131 |url=https://archive.org/details/alienslinguists00walt/page/2/mode/2up |accessdate=4 April 2020 |chapter=9}}</ref>. This is illustrated in [[H. G. Wells]]\u2019s ''[[Men Like Gods]]'' (1923). In this science fiction story, telepathy is used in daily communications, although the accuracy of what is communicated differs from person to person, with thought being rephrased and reflected based on the receiver's linguistic ability. Wells, through his character's dialogue, directly mentions how convenient a solution telepathy is to linguistic problems such as language barriers (related to: [[Linguistics in Science Fiction#Alien Communication|Alien Communication]]):\n\n{{Quote\n|text=\u201cAnd all things considered, it is really very convenient for us that there should be this method of transmission. For otherwise, I do not see how we could have avoided weeks of linguistic bother, first principles of our respective grammars, logic, significs, and so forth, boring stuff for the most part, before we could have got to anything like our present understanding\u201d<ref>{{Cite book|last=Wells|first=H. G.|title=Men Like Gods|publisher=Cassell (UK), Macmillan (US)|year=1923|isbn=|location=UK, US|pages=}}</ref> \n}}However, while conveniently giving a solution to that linguistic issue, Wells's form of telepathy seemed to create problems for other aspects of linguistics. Given that language change is a result of variations in speech, Walter E. Meyers suggested that this telepathy would result in an obstruction to language evolution (see: [[Linguistics in Science Fiction#Evolutionary Change|Evolutionary Change]]).\n\n{{Quote\n|text=\u201c...a universal telepathic power would slow down, and perhaps even halt [language] change altogether, if (and this is an important condition) change in language results from normal but inevitable variation in speech forms\u201d <ref>{{cite book |last1=Meyers |first1=Walter Earl |title=Aliens and linguists: language study and science fiction |date=1980 |publisher=Athens: University of Georgia |pages=134-135 |url=https://archive.org/details/alienslinguists00walt/page/2/mode/2up |accessdate=4 April 2020 |chapter=9}}</ref>\n|author=|title=|source=}}\n\nAlthough affecting speech, telepathy would not isolate writing from changes, as illustrated by Burrough in his Martian novels, where Mars has several forms of written language despite having only one spoken language. \n\nAs noted by Walter E. Meyers, Wells use of telepathy implies that:\n\n{{Quote\n|text=\u201c...telepathy transmits linguistic constructions\u201d <ref>{{cite book |last1=Meyers |first1=Walter Earl |title=Aliens and linguists: language study and science fiction |date=1980 |publisher=Athens: University of Georgia |page=136 |url=https://archive.org/details/alienslinguists00walt/page/2/mode/2up |accessdate=4 April 2020 |chapter=9}}</ref>\n}}\n\nIn doing so, however, differences between linguistic, lexical, and even cultural concepts of different language speakers would still hinder understanding between speakers using telepathy. The challenges presented by cultural barriers, for example, was presented in the work ''Prott'' by [[Margaret St. Clair]], in which a telepath laments that despite conducting 52 interviews with aliens named \u201cPrott\u201d he has been unable to learn much. As John W. Campbell pointed out in an editorial (see: [[Analog Science Fiction and Fact]]: Astounding, June 1941)\n\n{{Quote\n|text=\u201cMost of our words have background references that we know so well we tend to overlook them.\u201d \n}}\n\nAs per this quote, these background references may be easily understood by speakers of a language but not to the rest. Paul A. Carter summarised this well, explaining that \u201c... in situations demanding discernment of the cultural context of words, there might be trouble.\u201d <ref>{{cite book |last1=Meyers |first1=Walter Earl |title=Aliens and linguists: language study and science fiction |date=1980 |publisher=Athens: University of Georgia |page=137 |url=https://archive.org/details/alienslinguists00walt/page/2/mode/2up |accessdate=4 April 2020 |chapter=9}}</ref>.\n\nGiven such a problem, some science-fiction writers suggested pictures were transmitted via telepathy instead of words <ref name=\"meyers pg 138\">{{cite book |last1=Meyers |first1=Walter Earl |title=Aliens and linguists: language study and science fiction |date=1980 |publisher=Athens: University of Georgia |page=138 |url=https://archive.org/details/alienslinguists00walt/page/2/mode/2up |accessdate=4 April 2020 |chapter=9}}</ref>. This could be seen in works like [[Judith Merril]]\u2019s ''Whoever You Are'' <ref>{{cite web |title=The Best of Judith Merril |url=https://epdf.pub/the-best-of-judith-merril.html |website=ePDF |accessdate=4 April 2020 |page=18-31}}</ref> and Michael Elder <ref>{{cite web |title=Michael Elder |url=https://www.fantasticfiction.com/e/michael-elder/ |website=Fantastic Fiction |accessdate=4 April 2020}}</ref>\u2019s ''Flight to Terror'' (also known as ''Perfumed Planet'' <ref>{{cite web |title=The Perfumed Planet |url=https://www.fantasticfiction.com/e/michael-elder/perfumed-planet.htm |website=Fantastic Fiction |accessdate=4 April 2020}}</ref>). However, the process of transmitting pictures still involves a hidden form of linguistic structure, as mentioned by Meyers:\n\n{{Quote\n|text=\u201cIt is difficult to divorce the transmission of information in whatever medium from predications; introspection, if we can rely on it, seems to confirm that we think in linguistic structures.\u201d <ref name=\"meyers pg 138\" />\n}}\n\nThis brings back the question of barriers in language mentioned before. [[Stanley G. Weinbaum]] attempted to address this issue in his work ''[[The Lotus Eaters (Weinbaum)|The Lotus Eaters]]'', where the partly telepathetic alien learned the language from humans through its ability to read links between words as well as the conceptual meanings of the words, though only after the words are used by the humans. One other example of this concept of telepathy being limited to the surface of one\u2019s conscious mind appears in ''[[To Die in Italbar]]'' by [[Roger Zelazny]].\n\n[[Robert Heinlein]]\u2019s ''[[Time for the Stars]]'', however, presents a rather convincing argument that words, and not pictures, are transmitted through telepathy <ref>{{cite book |last1=Walter |first1=Walter Earl |title=Aliens and linguists: language study and science fiction |date=1980 |publisher=Athens: University of Georgia |page=139 |url=https://archive.org/details/alienslinguists00walt/page/2/mode/2up |accessdate=5 April 2020 |chapter=9}}</ref>. In the novel, the characters tried telepathy without using any words, but found \u201c...the silly, incoherent rumbling that went on in [the other\u2019s] mind in place of thought was as confusing and annoying, as senseless as finding yourself inside another person\u2019s dream <ref>{{cite book |last1=Heinlein |first1=Robert A. |title=Time for the Stars |date=1956 |page=28}}</ref>. The habitual receiving of each other\u2019s thoughts as words was explained by the psychologist in the novel as:\n\n{{Quote\n|text=\u201cThe ears and eyes and fingers are just data collectors; it is the brain that abstracts order out of chaos of data and gives it meaning\u2026 You expect words, your brain \u2018hears\u2019 words; it is a process used to and knows how to handle.\u201d <ref>{{cite book |last1=Heinlein |first1=Robert A. |title=Time for the Stars |pages=28-29}}</ref>\n}}\n\nDespite all these explanations offered by science fiction authors, telepathy still seems to be something unknown. As written in ''[[Blind Alley]]'' by [[Isaac Asimov]]:\n\n{{Quote\n|text=\u201cTelepathy! Telepathy! Telepathy! Might as well say by witch brew; Nobody knows anything about telepathy except its name. What is the mechanism of telepathy? What is the physiology and the physics of it?\u201d <ref>{{cite book |last1=Asimov |first1=Isaac |title=Blind Alley |page=178}}</ref>\n}}\n\nSeveral characters in science fiction novels do attempt to explore the workings of telepathy, however, such as the characters in [[Walter M. Miller Jr.]]\u2019s ''Command Performance'', or  [[Fritz Leiber]]\u2019s ''Deadly Moon''. \n\nRegardless of the reason behind the use of telepathy by authors of science fiction, whether a real interest in the topic or convenience, it is as Meyers points out:\n\n{{Quote\n|text=\u201c...there is no question that writers find the subject a fertile one for an array of linguistic functions.\u201d <ref>{{cite book |last1=Meyers |first1=Walter Earl |title=Aliens and linguists: language study and science fiction |date=1980 |publisher=Athens: University of Georgia |page=145 |url=https://archive.org/details/alienslinguists00walt/page/2/mode/2up |accessdate=5 April 2020 |chapter=9}}</ref>\n}}\n\n== Dystopian and Utopian Works of Science Fiction ==\n\nIn ''[[iarchive:alienslinguists00walt|Aliens and Linguists: Language Study and Science Fiction]]'', [[Walter E. Meyers]] stated that whether a work is [[Dystopia|Dystopian]] or [[Utopia|Utopian]] is a matter of perspective. To decide if a science fiction piece is intended by the author to be a dystopia or a utopia, Meyers argued, it is helpful to examine the language use in the fictional world of the book. The method that Meyers suggested in his book is not one of [[stylistics]] but to instead study how the language(s) spoken by characters are dictated, or not, by their leaders. According to Meyers, 30% to 50% of science fiction works touch on language in some ways while a high percentage of utopia science fiction works have language as a concern; at the same time, the importance of language can be missed by science fiction authors. \n\nFor this type of analysis, Meyers established that works of science fiction intended as Dystopian would involve thought control by fictional governments, often done through the control of the language of their fictional citizens. This means that more often than not, science fiction authors who touch on language are subscribers of the [[Sapir-Whorf hypothesis]]. \n\nThis type of language control can be seen in [[George Orwell]]\u2019s ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'', in the use of [[Newspeak]], which was aimed at making unorthodox political thought impossible. ''[[wikisource:The_Works_of_the_Rev._Jonathan_Swift/Volume_6/A_Voyage_to_the_Country_of_the_Houyhnhnms|A Voyage to the Country of the Houyhnhnms]]'' by [[Jonathan Swift]] is another example of this control. In his book, Meyers described Swift\u2019s manipulation in the novel as \u201celiminat[ing] dissent by destroying the ability of language to express fictions, theories, falsehoods, indeed, anything other than a statement of fact\u201d <ref>{{cite book |last1=Meyers |first1=Walter Earl |title=Aliens and linguists: language study and science fiction |date=1980 |publisher=Athens: University of Georgia |page=198 |url=https://archive.org/details/alienslinguists00walt/page/171/mode/1up/search/history |accessdate=12 April 2020 |chapter=12}}</ref>. In short, Swift\u2019s manipulation of language was an attempt to manipulate reality in his novel.\n\nFor these authors\u2019 Dystopian governments to work, Meyers argued that they \u201cmust not only enslave words, but also prevent the natural forces of languages from freeing them\u201d <ref>{{cite book |last1=Meyers |first1=Walter Earl |title=Aliens and linguists: language study and science fiction |date=1980 |publisher=Athens: University of Georgia |page=209 |url=https://archive.org/details/alienslinguists00walt/page/171/mode/1up/search/history |accessdate=12 April 2020 |chapter=12}}</ref>. This was because [[language change]] could become a form of liberation; words for dissent can be borrowed from other languages, made from existing words or coined entirely anew. To prevent language change from happening, authors wrote certain preventative measures into their stories.\n\n<br />\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Aspect of Language Change\n! Preventative Measures\n! Appearing Works\n|-\n| New vocabulary from borrowing\n| Forbid foreign contact.\nForbid foreign language learning.\n|''[[Walden Two]]'' by [[B. F. Skinner]]\nPeople were not allowed contact with the outside world and any time outside the present.

F. Skinner]]\nLanguage use was dictated, people had no access to private radios and were not allowed to turn off the national radio.\n|}\n\n\nMeyers also claimed that languages were used in science fiction as a tool for world building where authors often manipulated language in order to make their fictional worlds a Dystopian one. Meyers even went as far as to claim that the genre was \u201cespecially suited\u201d <ref name=\"meyers pg208\">{{cite book |last1=Meyers |first1=Walter Earl |title=Aliens and linguists: language study and science fiction |date=1980 |publisher=Athens: University of Georgia |page=208 |url=https://archive.org/details/alienslinguists00walt/page/171/mode/1up/search/history |accessdate=12 April 2020 |chapter=12}}</ref> for giving instruction about language.\n\nMeyers also lamented on the different ways science fiction missed out on opportunities to make a well-rounded and holistic manipulation of language for world building. One example he gave was of ''The Troika Incident'' <ref>{{cite book |last1=Brown |first1=James Cooke |title=The Troika Incident |date=1970 |url=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17436963-the-troika-incident}}</ref> by [[James Cooke Brown]]. Brown wrote the novel to test, with [[Loglan]], the [[Sapir-Whorf hypothesis]]. The characters in the novel were given the constructed language under the name Panlan to see if the constraints of the language would make their thought more logical. Given its Utopian nature, Brown wrote the novel such that Loglan speakers had a perfect feedback loop and kept improving the language as they spoke it, making it more logical. Loglan speakers, however, need to expand the vocabulary of Loglan for their society to function. Yet, as Meyers pointed out, Brown missed the opportunity to expand on how the language might evolve in the novel. \n\nMeyers also mentioned specific examples of figurative and creative uses of language that would not work in Loglan, which Brown could have gone in depth about. For example, if there were a music band named ''The Killers'' in the fictional world of the novel, speakers would need to create a word in Loglan that could be [[Interlinear gloss#Interlinear gloss|glossed]] as kill.\u0274\u1d0d\u1d22, yet can not be understood as a synonym of murderer. By design, creative word use would not work in Loglan. Additionally, Meyers commented that Brown neglected the possibility of language change in his fictional world, which might have made Loglan less logical than he would have liked.\n\nMeyers also argued that if fictional societies in science fiction were great, they were so \u201cin spite of a language designed for propaganda and a government willing to employ it\u201d <ref name=\"meyers pg208\" />\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Bongo-Bongo (linguistics)]]\n* [[Chinese word for \"crisis\"]]\n* [[Elvish languages (Middle-earth)]]\n* [[Folk linguistics]]\n* [[List of common misconceptions about language learning]]\n* [[Neuro-linguistic programming]]\n* [[Perceptual dialectology]]\n\n== References ==\n<!-- Inline citations added to your article will automatically display here.

External jugular vein marked by an arrow.]]\nHeart failure is a [[pathophysiological]] state in which [[cardiac output]] is insufficient to meet the needs of the body and lungs.<ref name=\"NICEChp1\">{{cite journal|author=National Clinical Guideline Centre (UK)|date=August 2010|title=Chronic heart failure: National clinical guideline for diagnosis and management in primary and secondary care: Partial update|journal=National Clinical Guideline Centre|pages=19\u201324|pmid=22741186}}</ref> The term \"congestive heart failure\"  is often used, as one of the common symptoms is [[wikt:congestion#Noun|congestion]], or build-up of fluid in a person's tissues and veins in the lungs or other parts of the body.<ref name=\"NICEChp1\" /> Specifically, congestion takes the form of [[water retention (medicine)|water retention]] and [[swelling (medical)|swelling]] ([[edema]]), both as [[peripheral edema]] (causing swollen limbs and feet) and as [[pulmonary edema]] (causing breathing difficulty), as well as [[ascites]] (swollen abdomen).\n\nHeart failure symptoms are traditionally and somewhat arbitrarily divided into \"left\" and \"right\" sided, recognizing that the left and right ventricles of the heart supply different portions of the circulation, however people commonly have both sets of signs and symptoms.\n\n===Left-sided failure===\n\nThe left side of the heart receives oxygen-rich blood from the lungs and pumps it forward to the [[circulatory system|systemic circulation]] (the rest of the body except for the [[pulmonary circulation]]). Failure of the left side of the heart causes blood to back up  (be congested) into the lungs, causing respiratory symptoms as well as fatigue due to insufficient supply of oxygenated blood. Common respiratory signs are [[tachypnea|increased rate of breathing]] and increased ''work'' of breathing (non-specific signs of respiratory distress). [[Rales]] or crackles, heard initially in the lung bases, and when severe, throughout the lung fields suggest the development of [[pulmonary edema]] (fluid in the [[Pulmonary alveolus|alveoli]]). [[Cyanosis]] which suggests severe [[hypoxemia|low blood oxygen]], is a late sign of extremely severe pulmonary edema.\n\nAdditional signs indicating left ventricular failure include a laterally displaced [[apex beat]] (which occurs if the heart is enlarged) and a [[gallop rhythm]] (additional heart sounds) may be heard as a marker of increased blood flow or increased intra-cardiac pressure. [[Heart murmur]]s may indicate the presence of valvular heart disease, either as a cause (e.g. [[aortic stenosis]]) or as a result (e.g. [[mitral regurgitation]]) of the heart failure.\n\n''Backward'' failure of the left ventricle causes congestion of the lungs' blood vessels, and so the symptoms are predominantly respiratory in nature. Backward failure can be subdivided into the failure of the left atrium, the left ventricle or both within the left circuit. The person will have [[dyspnea]] (shortness of breath) on exertion and in severe cases, dyspnea at rest. Increasing breathlessness on lying flat, called [[orthopnea]], occurs. It is often measured in the number of pillows required to lie comfortably, and in orthopnea, the person may resort to sleeping while sitting up. Another symptom of heart failure is [[paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea]]: a sudden nighttime attack of severe breathlessness, usually several hours after going to sleep. Easy [[fatigability]] and exercise intolerance are also common complaints related to respiratory compromise.\n\n\"[[Cardiac asthma]]\" or [[wheezing]] may occur.\n\nCompromise of left ventricular ''forward'' function may result in symptoms of poor systemic circulation such as [[dizziness]], [[confusion]] and cool extremities at rest.\n\n===Right-sided failure===\n[[File:Combinpedal.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|Severe peripheral (pitting) edema]]\n\nRight-sided heart failure is often caused by [[pulmonary heart disease]] (cor pulmonale), which is typically caused by difficulties of the [[pulmonary circulation]], such as [[pulmonary hypertension]] or [[pulmonic stenosis]].\n\nPhysical examination may reveal pitting peripheral [[edema]], [[ascites]], [[hepatomegaly|liver enlargement]], and [[splenomegaly|spleen enlargement]]. [[Jugular venous pressure]] is frequently assessed as a marker of fluid status, which can be accentuated by eliciting [[Abdominojugular test|hepatojugular reflux]]. If the right ventricular pressure is increased, a [[parasternal heave]] may be present, signifying the compensatory increase in contraction strength.\n\n''Backward'' failure of the right ventricle leads to congestion of systemic capillaries. This generates excess fluid accumulation in the body. This causes swelling under the skin (termed [[peripheral edema]] or [[anasarca]]) and usually affects the dependent parts of the body first (causing foot and ankle swelling in people who are standing up, and [[Sacrum|sacral]] edema in people who are predominantly lying down). [[Nocturia]] (frequent nighttime urination) may occur when fluid from the legs is returned to the bloodstream while lying down at night. In progressively severe cases, [[ascites]] (fluid accumulation in the abdominal cavity causing swelling) and liver enlargement may develop. Significant liver congestion may result in impaired liver function ([[congestive hepatopathy]]), and jaundice and even [[coagulopathy]] (problems of decreased or increased blood clotting) may occur.\n\n===Biventricular failure===\n\nDullness of the lung fields to [[percussion (medicine)|finger percussion]] and reduced breath sounds at the bases of the lung may suggest the development of a [[pleural effusion]] (fluid collection [[pleural cavity|between the lung and the chest wall]]). Though it can occur in isolated left- or right-sided heart failure, it is more common in biventricular failure because pleural veins drain into both the systemic and pulmonary venous systems. When unilateral, effusions are often right-sided.\n\nIf a person with a failure of one ventricle lives long enough, it will tend to progress to failure of both ventricles. For example, left ventricular failure allows pulmonary edema and pulmonary hypertension to occur, which increase stress on the right ventricle. Right ventricular failure is not as deleterious to the other side, but neither is it harmless.\n\n==Causes==\n\nViral infections of the heart can lead to [[Myocarditis|inflammation of the muscular layer of the heart]] and subsequently contribute to the development of heart failure. [[Cardiomyopathy|Heart damage]] can predispose a person to develop heart failure later in life and has many causes including systemic viral infections (e.g., [[HIV/AIDS|HIV]]), [[chemotherapeutic agent]]s such as [[daunorubicin]], [[cyclophosphamide]], [[trastuzumab]] and [[Substance abuse|abuse]] of drugs such as [[alcoholic beverage|alcohol]], [[cocaine]], and [[methamphetamine]]. An uncommon cause is exposure to certain toxins such as [[lead]] and [[cobalt]]. Additionally, infiltrative disorders such as [[amyloidosis]] and [[connective tissue disease]]s such as [[systemic lupus erythematosus]] have similar consequences. [[Obstructive sleep apnea]] (a condition of sleep wherein disordered breathing overlaps with obesity, hypertension, and/or diabetes) is regarded as an independent cause of heart failure.\n\n===High output heart failure===\n\nHeart failure may also occur in situations of \"high output\" (termed \"[[high-output heart failure]]\"), where the amount of blood pumped is more than typical and the heart is unable to keep up.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> This can occur in overload situations (blood or serum infusions), kidney diseases, chronic severe [[anemia]], [[beriberi]] (vitamin B<sub>1</sub>/[[thiamine]] deficiency), [[hyperthyroidism]], [[cirrhosis]], [[Paget's disease of bone|Paget's disease]], [[multiple myeloma]], [[arteriovenous fistula]]e, or [[arteriovenous malformation]]s.\n\n===Acute decompensation===\n{{main|Acute decompensated heart failure}}\n[[File:Kerley-B-Linien.jpg|thumb|Kerley B lines in acute cardiac decompensation. The short, horizontal lines can be found everywhere in the right lung.]]\nChronic stable heart failure may easily decompensate.

In heart failure, this mechanism fails, as the ventricle is loaded with blood to the point where heart muscle contraction becomes less efficient.

[[Cardiac arrest]] and [[asystole]] refer to situations in which there is ''no'' cardiac output at all. Without urgent treatment, these result in sudden death. [[Myocardial infarction]] (\"Heart attack\") refers to heart muscle damage due to insufficient blood supply, usually as a result of a blocked [[coronary artery]]. [[Cardiomyopathy]] refers specifically to problems within the heart muscle, and these problems can result in heart failure. Ischemic cardiomyopathy implies that the cause of muscle damage is [[coronary artery disease]]. [[Dilated cardiomyopathy]] implies that the muscle damage has resulted in enlargement of the heart. [[Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy]] involves enlargement and ''thickening'' of the heart muscle.\n\n===Ultrasound===\n\n[[Echocardiography]] is commonly used to support a clinical diagnosis of heart failure. This modality uses [[ultrasound]] to determine the [[stroke volume]] (SV, the amount of blood in the heart that exits the ventricles with each beat), the [[end-diastolic volume]] (EDV, the total amount of blood at the end of diastole), and the SV in proportion to the EDV, a value known as the ''[[ejection fraction]]'' (EF). In pediatrics, the [[shortening fraction]] is the preferred measure of systolic function. Normally, the EF should be between 50% and 70%; in systolic heart failure, it drops below 40%. Echocardiography can also identify valvular heart disease and assess the state of the [[pericardium]] (the connective tissue sac surrounding the heart). Echocardiography may also aid in deciding what treatments will help the person, such as medication, insertion of an [[implantable cardioverter-defibrillator]] or [[cardiac resynchronization therapy]]. Echocardiography can also help determine if acute myocardial ischemia is the precipitating cause, and may manifest as regional wall motion abnormalities on echo.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:UOTW 48 - Ultrasound of the Week 1.webm|Ultrasound showing severe systolic heart failure<ref name=UOTW48>{{cite web |title=UOTW #48 \u2013 Ultrasound of the Week |url=https://www.ultrasoundoftheweek.com/uotw-48/ |website=Ultrasound of the Week |access-date=27 May 2017 |date=23 May 2015 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170509130822/https://www.ultrasoundoftheweek.com/uotw-48/ |archive-date=9 May 2017 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\nFile:UOTW 48 - Ultrasound of the Week 2.webm|Ultrasound showing severe systolic heart failure<ref name=UOTW48/>\nFile:UOTW 48 - Ultrasound of the Week 3.webm|Ultrasound of the lungs showing edema due to severe systolic heart failure<ref name=UOTW48/>\nFile:UOTW 48 - Ultrasound of the Week 4.webm|Ultrasound showing severe systolic heart failure<ref name=UOTW48/>\nFile:UOTW 48 - Ultrasound of the Week 5.jpg|Ultrasound showing severe systolic heart failure<ref name=UOTW48/>\n</gallery>\n\n===Chest X-ray===\n[[File:Chest radiograph with signs of congestive heart failure - annotated.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|[[Chest radiograph]] of a lung with distinct [[Kerley lines|Kerley B lines]], as well as an [[Cardiomegaly|enlarged heart]] (as shown by an increased [[cardiothoracic ratio]], cephalization of pulmonary veins, and minor [[pleural effusion]] as seen for example in the right [[Horizontal fissure of right lung|horizontal fissure]].

CPX testing is usually required prior to heart transplantation as an indicator of prognosis. Cardiopulmonary exercise testing involves measurement of exhaled oxygen and carbon dioxide during exercise. The peak oxygen consumption (VO2 max) is used as an indicator of prognosis. As a general rule, a VO2 max less than 12\u201314 cc/kg/min indicates a poor survival and suggests that the person may be a candidate for a heart transplant.

External jugular vein marked by an arrow.]]\nHeart failure is a [[pathophysiological]] state in which [[cardiac output]] is insufficient to meet the needs of the body and lungs.<ref name=\"NICEChp1\" /> The term \"congestive heart failure\"  is often used, as one of the common symptoms is [[wikt:congestion#Noun|congestion]], or build-up of fluid in a person's tissues and veins in the lungs or other parts of the body.<ref name=\"NICEChp1\" /> Specifically, congestion takes the form of [[water retention (medicine)|water retention]] and [[swelling (medical)|swelling]] ([[edema]]), both as [[peripheral edema]] (causing swollen limbs and feet) and as [[pulmonary edema]] (causing breathing difficulty), as well as [[ascites]] (swollen abdomen).\n\nHeart failure symptoms are traditionally and somewhat arbitrarily divided into \"left\" and \"right\" sided, recognizing that the left and right ventricles of the heart supply different portions of the circulation, however people commonly have both sets of signs and symptoms.\n\n===Left-sided failure===\n\nThe left side of the heart receives oxygen-rich blood from the lungs and pumps it forward to the [[circulatory system|systemic circulation]] (the rest of the body except for the [[pulmonary circulation]]). Failure of the left side of the heart causes blood to back up  (be congested) into the lungs, causing respiratory symptoms as well as fatigue due to insufficient supply of oxygenated blood. Common respiratory signs are [[tachypnea|increased rate of breathing]] and increased ''work'' of breathing (non-specific signs of respiratory distress). [[Rales]] or crackles, heard initially in the lung bases, and when severe, throughout the lung fields suggest the development of [[pulmonary edema]] (fluid in the [[Pulmonary alveolus|alveoli]]). [[Cyanosis]] which suggests severe [[hypoxemia|low blood oxygen]], is a late sign of extremely severe pulmonary edema.\n\nAdditional signs indicating left ventricular failure include a laterally displaced [[apex beat]] (which occurs if the heart is enlarged) and a [[gallop rhythm]] (additional heart sounds) may be heard as a marker of increased blood flow or increased intra-cardiac pressure. [[Heart murmur]]s may indicate the presence of valvular heart disease, either as a cause (e.g. [[aortic stenosis]]) or as a result (e.g. [[mitral regurgitation]]) of the heart failure.\n\n''Backward'' failure of the left ventricle causes congestion of the lungs' blood vessels, and so the symptoms are predominantly respiratory in nature. Backward failure can be subdivided into the failure of the left atrium, the left ventricle or both within the left circuit. The person will have [[dyspnea]] (shortness of breath) on exertion and in severe cases, dyspnea at rest. Increasing breathlessness on lying flat, called [[orthopnea]], occurs. It is often measured in the number of pillows required to lie comfortably, and in orthopnea, the person may resort to sleeping while sitting up. Another symptom of heart failure is [[paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea]]: a sudden nighttime attack of severe breathlessness, usually several hours after going to sleep. Easy [[fatigability]] and exercise intolerance are also common complaints related to respiratory compromise.\n\n\"[[Cardiac asthma]]\" or [[wheezing]] may occur.\n\nCompromise of left ventricular ''forward'' function may result in symptoms of poor systemic circulation such as [[dizziness]], [[confusion]] and cool extremities at rest.\n\n===Right-sided failure===\n[[File:Combinpedal.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|Severe peripheral (pitting) edema]]\n\nRight-sided heart failure is often caused by [[pulmonary heart disease]] (cor pulmonale), which is typically caused by difficulties of the [[pulmonary circulation]], such as [[pulmonary hypertension]] or [[pulmonic stenosis]].\n\nPhysical examination may reveal pitting peripheral [[edema]], [[ascites]], [[hepatomegaly|liver enlargement]], and [[splenomegaly|spleen enlargement]]. [[Jugular venous pressure]] is frequently assessed as a marker of fluid status, which can be accentuated by eliciting [[Abdominojugular test|hepatojugular reflux]]. If the right ventricular pressure is increased, a [[parasternal heave]] may be present, signifying the compensatory increase in contraction strength.\n\n''Backward'' failure of the right ventricle leads to congestion of systemic capillaries. This generates excess fluid accumulation in the body. This causes swelling under the skin (termed [[peripheral edema]] or [[anasarca]]) and usually affects the dependent parts of the body first (causing foot and ankle swelling in people who are standing up, and [[Sacrum|sacral]] edema in people who are predominantly lying down). [[Nocturia]] (frequent nighttime urination) may occur when fluid from the legs is returned to the bloodstream while lying down at night. In progressively severe cases, [[ascites]] (fluid accumulation in the abdominal cavity causing swelling) and liver enlargement may develop. Significant liver congestion may result in impaired liver function ([[congestive hepatopathy]]), and jaundice and even [[coagulopathy]] (problems of decreased or increased blood clotting) may occur.\n\n===Biventricular failure===\n\nDullness of the lung fields to [[percussion (medicine)|finger percussion]] and reduced breath sounds at the bases of the lung may suggest the development of a [[pleural effusion]] (fluid collection [[pleural cavity|between the lung and the chest wall]]). Though it can occur in isolated left- or right-sided heart failure, it is more common in biventricular failure because pleural veins drain into both the systemic and pulmonary venous systems. When unilateral, effusions are often right-sided.\n\nIf a person with a failure of one ventricle lives long enough, it will tend to progress to failure of both ventricles. For example, left ventricular failure allows pulmonary edema and pulmonary hypertension to occur, which increase stress on the right ventricle. Right ventricular failure is not as deleterious to the other side, but neither is it harmless.\n\n==Causes==\n\nViral infections of the heart can lead to [[Myocarditis|inflammation of the muscular layer of the heart]] and subsequently contribute to the development of heart failure. [[Cardiomyopathy|Heart damage]] can predispose a person to develop heart failure later in life and has many causes including systemic viral infections (e.g., [[HIV/AIDS|HIV]]), [[chemotherapeutic agent]]s such as [[daunorubicin]], [[cyclophosphamide]], [[trastuzumab]] and [[Substance abuse|abuse]] of drugs such as [[alcoholic beverage|alcohol]], [[cocaine]], and [[methamphetamine]]. An uncommon cause is exposure to certain toxins such as [[lead]] and [[cobalt]]. Additionally, infiltrative disorders such as [[amyloidosis]] and [[connective tissue disease]]s such as [[systemic lupus erythematosus]] have similar consequences. [[Obstructive sleep apnea]] (a condition of sleep wherein disordered breathing overlaps with obesity, hypertension, and/or diabetes) is regarded as an independent cause of heart failure.\n\n===High output heart failure===\n\nHeart failure may also occur in situations of \"high output\" (termed \"[[high-output heart failure]]\"), where the amount of blood pumped is more than typical and the heart is unable to keep up.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> This can occur in overload situations (blood or serum infusions), kidney diseases, chronic severe [[anemia]], [[beriberi]] (vitamin B<sub>1</sub>/[[thiamine]] deficiency), [[hyperthyroidism]], [[cirrhosis]], [[Paget's disease of bone|Paget's disease]], [[multiple myeloma]], [[arteriovenous fistula]]e, or [[arteriovenous malformation]]s.\n\n===Acute decompensation===\n{{main|Acute decompensated heart failure}}\n[[File:Kerley-B-Linien.jpg|thumb|Kerley B lines in acute cardiac decompensation.

Over time these increases in workload, which are mediated by long-term activation of neurohormonal systems such as the [[renin\u2013angiotensin system]], leads to [[fibrosis]], dilation, and structural changes in the shape of the left ventricle from elliptical to spherical.<ref name=\"Lancet2017\"/>\n\nThe heart of a person with heart failure may have a reduced force of contraction due to overloading of the [[Ventricle (heart)|ventricle]]. In a normal heart, increased filling of the ventricle results in increased contraction force by the [[Frank\u2013Starling law of the heart]], and thus a rise in [[cardiac output]]. In heart failure, this mechanism fails, as the ventricle is loaded with blood to the point where heart muscle contraction becomes less efficient.

[[Cardiac arrest]] and [[asystole]] refer to situations in which there is ''no'' cardiac output at all. Without urgent treatment, these result in sudden death. [[Myocardial infarction]] (\"Heart attack\") refers to heart muscle damage due to insufficient blood supply, usually as a result of a blocked [[coronary artery]]. [[Cardiomyopathy]] refers specifically to problems within the heart muscle, and these problems can result in heart failure. Ischemic cardiomyopathy implies that the cause of muscle damage is [[coronary artery disease]]. [[Dilated cardiomyopathy]] implies that the muscle damage has resulted in enlargement of the heart. [[Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy]] involves enlargement and ''thickening'' of the heart muscle.\n\n===Ultrasound===\n\n[[Echocardiography]] is commonly used to support a clinical diagnosis of heart failure. This modality uses [[ultrasound]] to determine the [[stroke volume]] (SV, the amount of blood in the heart that exits the ventricles with each beat), the [[end-diastolic volume]] (EDV, the total amount of blood at the end of diastole), and the SV in proportion to the EDV, a value known as the ''[[ejection fraction]]'' (EF). In pediatrics, the [[shortening fraction]] is the preferred measure of systolic function. Normally, the EF should be between 50% and 70%; in systolic heart failure, it drops below 40%. Echocardiography can also identify valvular heart disease and assess the state of the [[pericardium]] (the connective tissue sac surrounding the heart). Echocardiography may also aid in deciding what treatments will help the person, such as medication, insertion of an [[implantable cardioverter-defibrillator]] or [[cardiac resynchronization therapy]]. Echocardiography can also help determine if acute myocardial ischemia is the precipitating cause, and may manifest as regional wall motion abnormalities on echo.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:UOTW 48 - Ultrasound of the Week 1.webm|Ultrasound showing severe systolic heart failure<ref name=UOTW48>{{cite web |title=UOTW #48 \u2013 Ultrasound of the Week |url=https://www.ultrasoundoftheweek.com/uotw-48/ |website=Ultrasound of the Week |access-date=27 May 2017 |date=23 May 2015 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170509130822/https://www.ultrasoundoftheweek.com/uotw-48/ |archive-date=9 May 2017 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\nFile:UOTW 48 - Ultrasound of the Week 2.webm|Ultrasound showing severe systolic heart failure<ref name=UOTW48/>\nFile:UOTW 48 - Ultrasound of the Week 3.webm|Ultrasound of the lungs showing edema due to severe systolic heart failure<ref name=UOTW48/>\nFile:UOTW 48 - Ultrasound of the Week 4.webm|Ultrasound showing severe systolic heart failure<ref name=UOTW48/>\nFile:UOTW 48 - Ultrasound of the Week 5.jpg|Ultrasound showing severe systolic heart failure<ref name=UOTW48/>\n</gallery>\n\n===Chest X-ray===\n[[File:Chest radiograph with signs of congestive heart failure - annotated.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|[[Chest radiograph]] of a lung with distinct [[Kerley lines|Kerley B lines]], as well as an [[Cardiomegaly|enlarged heart]] (as shown by an increased [[cardiothoracic ratio]], cephalization of pulmonary veins, and minor [[pleural effusion]] as seen for example in the right [[Horizontal fissure of right lung|horizontal fissure]].

This entails ensuring that [[ABC (medicine)|airway, breathing, and circulation]] are adequate.  Immediate treatments usually involve some combination of vasodilators such as [[Nitroglycerin (medication)|nitroglycerin]], diuretics such as [[furosemide]], and possibly [[noninvasive positive pressure ventilation]] (NIPPV).

In considering therapeutic options, it is important to first exclude reversible causes, including [[thyroid disease]], [[anemia]], chronic [[tachycardia]], [[alcohol abuse]], [[hypertension]] and dysfunction of one or more [[heart valves]]. Treatment of the underlying cause is usually the first approach to treating heart failure. However, in the majority of cases, either no primary cause is found or treatment of the primary cause does not restore normal heart function. In these cases, [[behavioral treatments|behavioral]], [[Medical treatment|medical]] and [[medical device|device]] treatment strategies exist which can provide a significant improvement in outcomes, including the relief of symptoms, exercise tolerance, and a decrease in the likelihood of [[hospitalization]] or death. Breathlessness rehabilitation for [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]] (COPD) and heart failure has been proposed with exercise training as a core component.

In people with left ventricular ejection (LVEF) below 35%, the incidence of [[ventricular tachycardia]] (VT) or [[sudden cardiac death]] is high enough to warrant AICD placement.

CPX testing is usually required prior to heart transplantation as an indicator of prognosis. Cardiopulmonary exercise testing involves measurement of exhaled oxygen and carbon dioxide during exercise. The peak oxygen consumption (VO2 max) is used as an indicator of prognosis. As a general rule, a VO2 max less than 12\u201314 cc/kg/min indicates a poor survival and suggests that the person may be a candidate for a heart transplant.
