According to Russian sources, after 1 p.m., Turkish troops conducted more than 15 [[Man-portable air-defense system|MANPADS]] attacks against the Russian and Syrian jets, with some Russian aircraft allegedly suffering damage while evading the fire.<ref name = \"deciphering\"/>\n\nAt around 5 p.m., a 400-man Turkish mechanized infantry battalion traveling in a convoy was targeted by an airstrike on the road between al-Bara and Balyun, around five kilometers north of [[Kafr Nabl]]. A light airstrike by a Su-22s halted the convoy, after which more intense bombing forced the Turkish soldiers to take shelter in the nearby buildings. The Russian jets then reportedly dropped [[KAB-1500L]] laser-guided bombs on the Turkish positions, collapsing two buildings and leaving a number of soldiers under the rubble. Russia denied it carried out airstrikes in the area and stated it made attempts to ensure the Syrian military ceased firing to allow the evacuation of the Turkish troops, but noted the Turkish forces should not have been in the area, where \"counter-terror operations\" were taking place, and that Turkey failed to notify it about the soldiers' presence in advance.<ref name = \"deciphering\"/>\n\nOn 28 February, the Defense Ministry of Turkey stated that a day after 33 of their soldiers were killed in the air strike, artillery fire was launched by Syrian forces in northwest Idlib province of Syria, which led to the killing of one Turkish soldier and two others injured. The Turkish military also continued to attack Syrian Goverment targets in the region as well, according to the defense ministry. <ref>{{Cite web|url= https://www.reuters.com/article/us-syria-security-turkey-shelling/one-turkish-soldier-killed-two-wounded-in-syrias-idlib-ministry-idUSKCN20M343 |title= One Turkish soldier killed, two wounded in Syria's Idlib: ministry. |}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url= https://www.dailysabah.com/politics/56-syrian-regime-troops-military-hardware-destroyed-as-another-turkish-soldier-killed-in-idlib/news |title= 56 Syrian regime troops, military hardware destroyed as another Turkish soldier killed in Idlib. |}}</ref> Turkey said it retaliated for Balyun strikes by striking 200 Syrian government targets and 309 soldiers.<ref name=\"BBC News 2020 alarm after\">{{cite web | title=Alarm after Syrian attack kills Turkish soldiers | website=BBC News | date=2020-02-28 | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-51667717 | access-date=2020-02-28}}</ref> NATO and the US expressed support for Turkey and urged Russia to engage with UN ceasefire efforts, while the UN expressed concern at developments.<ref name=\"BBC News 2020 alarm after\"/><ref name=\"DW.COM airstrikes\">{{cite web | title=Syrian airstrikes kill dozens of Turkish troops in Idlib - live updates - 28.02.2020 | website=DW.COM | url=https://www.dw.com/en/syrian-airstrikes-kill-dozens-of-turkish-troops-in-idlib-live-updates/a-52565996 | access-date=2020-02-28}}</ref>\n\n===Northeastern Syria===\nOn 12 February, government supporters blocked and pelted a US military convoy passing through Qamishli town in northeastern Syria, which led to a clash with US troops, one civilian died by US fire and another injured.

For example, [[California]], [[Texas]], [[Colorado]], [[New Mexico]] (1598), [[Arizona]], [[Nevada]], [[Florida]] and [[Puerto Rico]] have been home to Spanish-speaking peoples since the 16th century, long before the U.S. existed. (The language of the Native Americans existed before this, until the invasion and forced assimilation by the Spanish.) These and other Spanish-speaking territories were part of the [[Viceroyalty of New Spain]], and later [[Mexico]] (with the exception of Florida and Puerto Rico), before these regions joined or were taken over by the United States in 1848(Puerto Rico was in 1898). Some cities in the U.S. were founded by Spanish settlers as early as the 16th century, prior to the creation of the [[Thirteen Colonies]]. For example, San Miguel de Gualdape, [[Pensacola, Florida|Pensacola]] and [[St. Augustine, Florida]] were founded in 1526, 1559 and 1565 respectively. [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]] was founded in 1604, and [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]] was established in 1660. [[El Paso]] was founded in 1659, [[San Antonio]] in 1691, [[Laredo, Texas]] in 1755, [[San Diego]] in 1769, [[San Francisco]] in 1776, [[San Jose, California]] in 1777, [[New Iberia, Louisiana]] in 1779, and [[Los Angeles]] in 1781. Therefore, in many parts of the U.S., the Hispanic cultural legacy predates English/British influence. For this reason, many generations have largely maintained their cultural traditions and [[Spanish language]] well before the United States was created. However, Spanish-speaking persons in many Hispanic areas in the U.S. amounted to only a few thousand people when they became part of the United States; a large majority of current Hispanic residents are descended from Hispanics who entered the United States in the mid-to-late 20th and early 21st centuries.\n\nLanguage retention is a common index to assimilation; according to the 2000 census, about 75% of all Hispanics spoke Spanish in the home. Spanish language retention rates vary geographically; parts of Texas and New Mexico have language retention rates over 90%, whereas in parts of Colorado and California, retention rates are lower than 30%. The degree of retention of Spanish as the native language is based on recent arrival from countries where Spanish is spoken. As is true of other immigrants, those who were born in other countries still speak their native language. Later generations are increasingly less likely to speak the language spoken in the country of their ancestors, as is true of other immigrant groups.\n\n==Spanish-speaking countries and regions==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" align=\"right\" line-height=\"0.87em\"\n|-valign=\"top\" border=\"1\" style=\"background:#FFFF00;\"\n| align=\"center\" |'''[[Hispanophone|Spanish-speaking countries]]'''\n|-\n|[[File:Map of the spanish language uses.png|320x220px|Map showing usage of the Spanish language]]\n|-\n|{{legend|Red|<small>''Spanish identified as sole official language''</small>}}\n|-\n|{{legend|#000080|<small>''Spanish identified as co-official language''</small>}}\n|-\n|{{legend|#00ff55|<small>''Former Spanish co-official, now identified as auxiliary <br>language''</small>}}\n|}\n\n{{See also|Hispanophone|Hispanic America|List of countries where Spanish is an official language}}\nToday, Spanish is among the [[List of languages by number of native speakers|most commonly spoken first languages]] of the world.

For instance, the music from Spain is a lot different from the [[Hispanic America]]n, although there is a high grade of exchange between both continents. In addition, due to the high national development of the diverse [[nationalities and regions of Spain]], there is a lot of music in the [[Languages of Spain|different languages of the Peninsula]] ([[Catalan language|Catalan]], [[Galician language|Galician]] and [[Basque language|Basque]], mainly). See, for instance, [[Music of Catalonia]] or [[Rock catal\u00e0]], [[Music of Galicia, Cantabria and Asturias]], and [[Basque music]]. [[Flamenco]] is also a very popular music style in Spain, especially in [[Andalusia]]. Spanish ballads \"romances\" can be traced in Argentina as \"milongas\", same structure but different scenarios.\n\nOn the other side of the ocean, Hispanic America is also home to a wide variety of music, even though \"Latin\" music is often erroneously thought of, as a single genre. Hispanic Caribbean music tends to favor complex polyrhythms of African origin. [[Music of Mexico|Mexican music]] shows combined influences of mostly European and Native American origin, while traditional Northern Mexican music \u2014 [[norte\u00f1o (music)|norte\u00f1o]] and [[banda music|banda]] \u2014  [[polka]], has influence from polka music brought by [[Central Europe]]an settlers to [[Mexico]] which later influenced western music.  The music of Hispanic Americans \u2014 such as [[tejano music]] \u2014 has influences in [[Rock music|rock]], [[jazz]], [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]], [[Latin pop|pop]], and [[country music]] as well as traditional Mexican music such as [[Mariachi]]. Meanwhile, native [[Andes|Andean]] sounds and melodies are the backbone of Peruvian and Bolivian music, but also play a significant role in the popular music of most South American countries and are heavily incorporated into the folk music of Ecuador and Chile and the tunes of Colombia, and again in Chile where they play a fundamental role in the form of the greatly followed [[nueva canci\u00f3n]]. In U.S. communities of immigrants from these countries it is common to hear these styles. [[Latin pop]], [[Rock en Espa\u00f1ol]], [[Hip-hop|Latin hip-hop]], [[Salsa (dance)|Salsa]], [[Merengue (dance)|Merengue]], [[Cumbia]] and [[Reggaeton]] styles tend to appeal to the broader Hispanic population, and varieties of Cuban music are popular with many Hispanics of all backgrounds.\n\n===Literature===\n{{Main|Hispanic literature}}\n\n[[File:Medal of the Miguel de Cervantes Prize.svg|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Miguel de Cervantes Prize]], most prestigious literary award in the Spanish language]]\n\nSpanish-language literature and folklore is very rich and is influenced by a variety of countries. There are thousands of writers from many places, and dating from the Middle Ages to the present. Some of the most recognized writers are [[Miguel de Cervantes|Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra]] (Spain), [[Lope de Vega]] (Spain), [[Pedro Calder\u00f3n de la Barca|Calder\u00f3n de la Barca]] (Spain), [[Jose Rizal]] (Philippines), [[Carlos Fuentes]] (Mexico), [[Octavio Paz]] (Mexico), [[Miguel \u00c1ngel Asturias]] (Guatemala), [[George Santayana]] (US), [[Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed]] (Cuba), [[Sabine Ulibarri]] (US), [[Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca]] (Spain), [[Miguel de Unamuno]] (Spain), [[Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez]] (Colombia), [[Rafael Pombo]] (Colombia), [[Horacio Quiroga]] (Uruguay), [[R\u00f3mulo Gallegos]] (Venezuela), [[Luis Rodriguez Varela]] (Philippines), [[Rub\u00e9n Dar\u00edo]] (Nicaragua), [[Mario Vargas Llosa]] (Peru), [[Giannina Braschi]] (Puerto Rico), [[Cristina Peri Rossi]] (Uruguay), [[Luisa Valenzuela]] (Argentina), [[Roberto Quesada]] (Honduras), [[Julio Cort\u00e1zar]] (Argentina), [[Pablo Neruda]] (Chile), [[Gabriela Mistral]] (Chile), [[Jorge Luis Borges]] (Argentina), [[Pedro Henr\u00edquez Ure\u00f1a]] (Dominican Republic), [[Ernesto Sabato]] (Argentina), [[Juan Tom\u00e1s \u00c1vila Laurel]] (Equatorial Guinea), [[Ciro Alegr\u00eda]] (Peru), [[Joaquin Garcia Monge]] (Costa Rica), and [[Jesus Balmori]] (Philippines).\n\n===Sports===\nIn the majority of the Hispanic countries, [[association football]] is the most popular sport. The men's national teams of Argentina, Uruguay and Spain have won the [[FIFA World Cup]] a total five times. The Spanish [[La Liga]] is one of the most popular in the world, known for [[FC Barcelona]] and [[Real Madrid]]. Meanwhile, the [[Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n]] and [[Mexican Primera Divisi\u00f3n]] are two of the strongest leagues in the Americas.\n\nHowever, [[baseball]] is the most popular sport in some Central American and Caribbean countries (especially Cuba, Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, and Venezuela), as well as in the diaspora in the United States. Notable Hispanic teams in early baseball are the [[All Cubans]], [[Cuban Stars (West)|Cuban Stars]] and [[New York Cubans]]. The [[Hispanic Heritage Baseball Museum]] recognizes Hispanic baseball personalities. Nearly 30 percent (22 percent foreign-born Latinos) of [[MLB]] players today have Hispanic heritage.\n\nSeveral Hispanic sportspeople have been successful worldwide, such as [[Diego Maradona]], [[Alfredo di Stefano]], [[Lionel Messi]], [[Diego Forl\u00e1n]] (association football), [[Juan Manuel Fangio]], [[Juan Pablo Montoya]], [[Eliseo Salazar]], [[Fernando Alonso]], [[Marc Gen\u00e9]], [[Carlos Sainz]] (auto racing), [[\u00c1ngel Nieto]], [[Dani Pedrosa]], [[Jorge Lorenzo]], [[Marc M\u00e1rquez]], [[Marc Coma]], [[Nani Roma]] (motorcycle racing), [[Emanuel Gin\u00f3bili]], [[Pau Gasol]], [[Marc Gasol]] (basketball), [[Julio C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez]], [[Sa\u00fal \u00c1lvarez]], [[Carlos Monz\u00f3n]] (boxing), [[Miguel Indurain]], [[Alberto Contador]], [[Santiago Botero]], [[Rigoberto Ur\u00e1n]], [[Nairo Quintana]] (cycling), [[Roberto de Vicenzo]], [[\u00c1ngel Cabrera]], [[Sergio Garc\u00eda]], [[Severiano Ballesteros]], [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Olaz\u00e1bal]] (golf), [[Luciana Aymar]] (field hockey), [[Rafael Nadal]], [[Marcelo R\u00edos]], [[Guillermo Vilas]], [[Gabriela Sabatini]], [[Juan Mart\u00edn del Potro]] (tennis).\n\nNotable Hispanic sports television networks are [[ESPN Latin America]], [[Fox Sports Latin America]] and [[TyC Sports]].\n\n===Religion===\nThe Spaniards and the Portuguese took the [[Roman Catholic]] faith to Ibero-America and the Philippines, and Roman Catholicism remains the predominant religion amongst most Hispanics. A small but growing number of Hispanics belong to a [[Protestantism|Protestant]] denomination.\n{{Unbalanced section|date=December 2009}}\nThere are also Spanish-speaking [[Jew]]s, most of whom are the descendants of [[Ashkenazi Jews]] who migrated from Europe (German Jews, Russian Jews, Polish Jews, etc.) to Hispanic America, particularly [[Argentina]], [[Uruguay]], [[Peru]] and [[Cuba]] (Argentina is host to the third largest Jewish population in the Western Hemisphere, after the United States and Canada)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://jppi.org.il/uploads/JPPI_2014-2015_Annual_Assessment-English.pdf |title=Annual Assessment: The Situation and Dynamics of the Jewish People |year=2015 |page=18 |work=The Jewish People Policy Planning Institute |accessdate=19 January 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ujc.org/section.html?id=29 |title=Global Jewish Populations |work=United Jewish Federations |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080531003148/http://www.ujc.org/section.html?id=29 |archivedate=2008-05-31 }}</ref> in the 19th century and following World War II. Many Spanish-speaking Jews also originate from the small communities of reconverted descendants of [[anusim]] \u2014 those whose Spanish [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardi Jewish]] ancestors long ago hid their Jewish ancestry and beliefs in fear of persecution by the [[Spanish Inquisition]] in the [[Iberian Peninsula]] and Ibero-America. The Spanish Inquisition led to many forced conversions of Spanish Jews.\n\nGenetic studies on the (male) [[Y chromosome|Y-chromosome]] conducted by the [[University of Leeds]] in 2008 appear to support the idea that the number of forced conversions have been previously underestimated significantly. They found that twenty percent of Spanish males have Y-chromosomes associated with Sephardic Jewish ancestry.<ref>{{cite news |first=Nicholas |last=Wade |title=Gene Test Shows Spain's Jewish and Muslim Mix |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=5 December 2008 |page=A12 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/05/science/05genes.html |url-access=subscription }}</ref> This may imply that there were more forced conversions than was previously thought.\n\nThere are also thought to be many Catholic-professing descendants of [[marrano]]s and Spanish-speaking [[Crypto-Judaism|crypto-Jews]] in the [[Southwestern United States]] and scattered through Hispanic America. Additionally, there are Sephardic Jews who are descendants of those Jews who fled Spain to Turkey, [[Syria]], and North Africa, some of whom have now migrated to Hispanic America, holding on to some Spanish/Sephardic customs, such as the [[Judaeo-Spanish|Ladino]] language, which mixes Spanish, Hebrew, Arabic and others, though written with Hebrew and Latin characters.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Ladino |title=Ladino |work=Online Etymology Dictionary |accessdate=19 January 2016}}</ref> [[Slavery|Ladinos]] were also African slaves captive in Spain held prior to the colonial period in the Americas. (See also [[History of the Jews in Latin America|History of the Jews in Hispanic America]] and [[List of Latin American Jews|List of Hispanic American Jews]].)\n\nAmong the Spanish-speaking Catholics, most communities celebrate their homeland's [[patron saint]], dedicating a day for this purpose with festivals and religious services. Some Spanish-speakers syncretize Roman Catholicism and African or Native American rituals and beliefs. Such is the case of [[Santer\u00eda]], popular with [[Afro-Cuban]]s, which combines old African beliefs in the form of Roman Catholic saints and rituals. Other syncretistic beliefs include [[Spiritism]] and [[Curandero|Curanderismo]].\n\nWhile a tiny minority, there are some Muslims in Latin America, in the US, and in the Philippines. Those in the Philippines live predominantly in the province forming the [[Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao]].\n\nIn the United States, some 65% of Hispanics and Latinos report themselves Catholic and 21% Protestant, with 13% having no affiliation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pewtrusts.org/pdf/religion_hispanic_churches.pdf |title=Hispanic Churches in American Public Life: Summary of Findings |accessdate=27 December 2006 |date=January 2003 |last1=Espinosa |first1=Gast\u00f3n |last2=Elizondo |first2=Virgilio |last3=Miranda |first3=Jesse |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061101044854/http://www.pewtrusts.org/pdf/religion_hispanic_churches.pdf |archivedate=1 November 2006}}</ref> A minority among the Roman Catholics, about one in five, are [[charismatic Christianity|charismatics]].

Hispanization of a person might be illustrated by speaking Spanish, making and eating Hispanic American food, listening to Spanish language music or participating in Hispanic festivals and holidays - Hispanization of those outside the Hispanic community as opposed to [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]] of Hispanics into theirs.\n\nOne reason that some people believe the assimilation of Hispanics in the U.S. is not comparable to that of other cultural groups is that [[Hispanic and Latino Americans]] have been living in parts of North America for centuries, in many cases well before the English-speaking culture became dominant. For example, [[California]], [[Texas]], [[Colorado]], [[New Mexico]] (1598), [[Arizona]], [[Nevada]], [[Florida]] and [[Puerto Rico]] have been home to Spanish-speaking peoples since the 16th century, long before the U.S. existed. (The language of the Native Americans existed before this, until the invasion and forced assimilation by the Spanish.) These and other Spanish-speaking territories were part of the [[Viceroyalty of New Spain]], and later [[Mexico]] (with the exception of Florida and Puerto Rico), before these regions joined or were taken over by the United States in 1848(Puerto Rico was in 1898). Some cities in the U.S. were founded by Spanish settlers as early as the 16th century, prior to the creation of the [[Thirteen Colonies]]. For example, San Miguel de Gualdape, [[Pensacola, Florida|Pensacola]] and [[St. Augustine, Florida]] were founded in 1526, 1559 and 1565 respectively. [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]] was founded in 1604, and [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]] was established in 1660. [[El Paso]] was founded in 1659, [[San Antonio]] in 1691, [[Laredo, Texas]] in 1755, [[San Diego]] in 1769, [[San Francisco]] in 1776, [[San Jose, California]] in 1777, [[New Iberia, Louisiana]] in 1779, and [[Los Angeles]] in 1781. Therefore, in many parts of the U.S., the Hispanic cultural legacy predates English/British influence. For this reason, many generations have largely maintained their cultural traditions and [[Spanish language]] well before the United States was created. However, Spanish-speaking persons in many Hispanic areas in the U.S. amounted to only a few thousand people when they became part of the United States; a large majority of current Hispanic residents are descended from Hispanics who entered the United States in the mid-to-late 20th and early 21st centuries.\n\nLanguage retention is a common index to assimilation; according to the 2000 census, about 75% of all Hispanics spoke Spanish in the home. Spanish language retention rates vary geographically; parts of Texas and New Mexico have language retention rates over 90%, whereas in parts of Colorado and California, retention rates are lower than 30%. The degree of retention of Spanish as the native language is based on recent arrival from countries where Spanish is spoken. As is true of other immigrants, those who were born in other countries still speak their native language. Later generations are increasingly less likely to speak the language spoken in the country of their ancestors, as is true of other immigrant groups.\n\n==Spanish-speaking countries and regions==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" align=\"right\" line-height=\"0.87em\"\n|-valign=\"top\" border=\"1\" style=\"background:#FFFF00;\"\n| align=\"center\" |'''[[Hispanophone|Spanish-speaking countries]]'''\n|-\n|[[File:Map of the spanish language uses.png|320x220px|Map showing usage of the Spanish language]]\n|-\n|{{legend|Red|<small>''Spanish identified as sole official language''</small>}}\n|-\n|{{legend|#000080|<small>''Spanish identified as co-official language''</small>}}\n|-\n|{{legend|#00ff55|<small>''Former Spanish co-official, now identified as auxiliary <br>language''</small>}}\n|}\n\n{{See also|Hispanophone|Hispanic America|List of countries where Spanish is an official language}}\nToday, Spanish is among the [[List of languages by number of native speakers|most commonly spoken first languages]] of the world.

For instance, the music from Spain is a lot different from the [[Hispanic America]]n, although there is a high grade of exchange between both continents. In addition, due to the high national development of the diverse [[nationalities and regions of Spain]], there is a lot of music in the [[Languages of Spain|different languages of the Peninsula]] ([[Catalan language|Catalan]], [[Galician language|Galician]] and [[Basque language|Basque]], mainly). See, for instance, [[Music of Catalonia]] or [[Rock catal\u00e0]], [[Music of Galicia, Cantabria and Asturias]], and [[Basque music]]. [[Flamenco]] is also a very popular music style in Spain, especially in [[Andalusia]]. Spanish ballads \"romances\" can be traced in Argentina as \"milongas\", same structure but different scenarios.\n\nOn the other side of the ocean, Hispanic America is also home to a wide variety of music, even though \"Latin\" music is often erroneously thought of, as a single genre. Hispanic Caribbean music tends to favor complex polyrhythms of African origin. [[Music of Mexico|Mexican music]] shows combined influences of mostly European and Native American origin, while traditional Northern Mexican music \u2014 [[norte\u00f1o (music)|norte\u00f1o]] and [[banda music|banda]] \u2014  [[polka]], has influence from polka music brought by [[Central Europe]]an settlers to [[Mexico]] which later influenced western music.  The music of Hispanic Americans \u2014 such as [[tejano music]] \u2014 has influences in [[Rock music|rock]], [[jazz]], [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]], [[Latin pop|pop]], and [[country music]] as well as traditional Mexican music such as [[Mariachi]]. Meanwhile, native [[Andes|Andean]] sounds and melodies are the backbone of Peruvian and Bolivian music, but also play a significant role in the popular music of most South American countries and are heavily incorporated into the folk music of Ecuador and Chile and the tunes of Colombia, and again in Chile where they play a fundamental role in the form of the greatly followed [[nueva canci\u00f3n]]. In U.S. communities of immigrants from these countries it is common to hear these styles. [[Latin pop]], [[Rock en Espa\u00f1ol]], [[Hip-hop|Latin hip-hop]], [[Salsa (dance)|Salsa]], [[Merengue (dance)|Merengue]], [[Cumbia]] and [[Reggaeton]] styles tend to appeal to the broader Hispanic population, and varieties of Cuban music are popular with many Hispanics of all backgrounds.\n\n===Literature===\n{{Main|Hispanic literature}}\n\n[[File:Medal of the Miguel de Cervantes Prize.svg|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Miguel de Cervantes Prize]], most prestigious literary award in the Spanish language]]\n\nSpanish-language literature and folklore is very rich and is influenced by a variety of countries. There are thousands of writers from many places, and dating from the Middle Ages to the present. Some of the most recognized writers are [[Miguel de Cervantes|Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra]] (Spain), [[Lope de Vega]] (Spain), [[Pedro Calder\u00f3n de la Barca|Calder\u00f3n de la Barca]] (Spain), [[Jose Rizal]] (Philippines), [[Carlos Fuentes]] (Mexico), [[Octavio Paz]] (Mexico), [[Miguel \u00c1ngel Asturias]] (Guatemala), [[George Santayana]] (US), [[Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed]] (Cuba), [[Sabine Ulibarri]] (US), [[Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca]] (Spain), [[Miguel de Unamuno]] (Spain), [[Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez]] (Colombia), [[Rafael Pombo]] (Colombia), [[Horacio Quiroga]] (Uruguay), [[R\u00f3mulo Gallegos]] (Venezuela), [[Luis Rodriguez Varela]] (Philippines), [[Rub\u00e9n Dar\u00edo]] (Nicaragua), [[Mario Vargas Llosa]] (Peru), [[Giannina Braschi]] (Puerto Rico), [[Cristina Peri Rossi]] (Uruguay), [[Luisa Valenzuela]] (Argentina), [[Roberto Quesada]] (Honduras), [[Julio Cort\u00e1zar]] (Argentina), [[Pablo Neruda]] (Chile), [[Gabriela Mistral]] (Chile), [[Jorge Luis Borges]] (Argentina), [[Pedro Henr\u00edquez Ure\u00f1a]] (Dominican Republic), [[Ernesto Sabato]] (Argentina), [[Juan Tom\u00e1s \u00c1vila Laurel]] (Equatorial Guinea), [[Ciro Alegr\u00eda]] (Peru), [[Joaquin Garcia Monge]] (Costa Rica), and [[Jesus Balmori]] (Philippines).\n\n===Sports===\nIn the majority of the Hispanic countries, [[association football]] is the most popular sport. The men's national teams of Argentina, Uruguay and Spain have won the [[FIFA World Cup]] a total five times. The Spanish [[La Liga]] is one of the most popular in the world, known for [[FC Barcelona]] and [[Real Madrid]]. Meanwhile, the [[Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n]] and [[Mexican Primera Divisi\u00f3n]] are two of the strongest leagues in the Americas.\n\nHowever, [[baseball]] is the most popular sport in some Central American and Caribbean countries (especially Cuba, Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, and Venezuela), as well as in the diaspora in the United States. Notable Hispanic teams in early baseball are the [[All Cubans]], [[Cuban Stars (West)|Cuban Stars]] and [[New York Cubans]]. The [[Hispanic Heritage Baseball Museum]] recognizes Hispanic baseball personalities. Nearly 30 percent (22 percent foreign-born Latinos) of [[MLB]] players today have Hispanic heritage.\n\nSeveral Hispanic sportspeople have been successful worldwide, such as [[Diego Maradona]], [[Alfredo di Stefano]], [[Lionel Messi]], [[Diego Forl\u00e1n]] (association football), [[Juan Manuel Fangio]], [[Juan Pablo Montoya]], [[Eliseo Salazar]], [[Fernando Alonso]], [[Marc Gen\u00e9]], [[Carlos Sainz]] (auto racing), [[\u00c1ngel Nieto]], [[Dani Pedrosa]], [[Jorge Lorenzo]], [[Marc M\u00e1rquez]], [[Marc Coma]], [[Nani Roma]] (motorcycle racing), [[Emanuel Gin\u00f3bili]], [[Pau Gasol]], [[Marc Gasol]] (basketball), [[Julio C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez]], [[Sa\u00fal \u00c1lvarez]], [[Carlos Monz\u00f3n]] (boxing), [[Miguel Indurain]], [[Alberto Contador]], [[Santiago Botero]], [[Rigoberto Ur\u00e1n]], [[Nairo Quintana]] (cycling), [[Roberto de Vicenzo]], [[\u00c1ngel Cabrera]], [[Sergio Garc\u00eda]], [[Severiano Ballesteros]], [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Olaz\u00e1bal]] (golf), [[Luciana Aymar]] (field hockey), [[Rafael Nadal]], [[Marcelo R\u00edos]], [[Guillermo Vilas]], [[Gabriela Sabatini]], [[Juan Mart\u00edn del Potro]] (tennis).\n\nNotable Hispanic sports television networks are [[ESPN Latin America]], [[Fox Sports Latin America]] and [[TyC Sports]].\n\n===Religion===\nThe Spaniards and the Portuguese took the [[Roman Catholic]] faith to Ibero-America and the Philippines, and Roman Catholicism remains the predominant religion amongst most Hispanics. A small but growing number of Hispanics belong to a [[Protestantism|Protestant]] denomination.\n{{Unbalanced section|date=December 2009}}\nThere are also Spanish-speaking [[Jew]]s, most of whom are the descendants of [[Ashkenazi Jews]] who migrated from Europe (German Jews, Russian Jews, Polish Jews, etc.) to Hispanic America, particularly [[Argentina]], [[Uruguay]], [[Peru]] and [[Cuba]] (Argentina is host to the third largest Jewish population in the Western Hemisphere, after the United States and Canada)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://jppi.org.il/uploads/JPPI_2014-2015_Annual_Assessment-English.pdf |title=Annual Assessment: The Situation and Dynamics of the Jewish People |year=2015 |page=18 |work=The Jewish People Policy Planning Institute |accessdate=19 January 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ujc.org/section.html?id=29 |title=Global Jewish Populations |work=United Jewish Federations |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080531003148/http://www.ujc.org/section.html?id=29 |archivedate=2008-05-31 }}</ref> in the 19th century and following World War II. Many Spanish-speaking Jews also originate from the small communities of reconverted descendants of [[anusim]] \u2014 those whose Spanish [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardi Jewish]] ancestors long ago hid their Jewish ancestry and beliefs in fear of persecution by the [[Spanish Inquisition]] in the [[Iberian Peninsula]] and Ibero-America. The Spanish Inquisition led to many forced conversions of Spanish Jews.\n\nGenetic studies on the (male) [[Y chromosome|Y-chromosome]] conducted by the [[University of Leeds]] in 2008 appear to support the idea that the number of forced conversions have been previously underestimated significantly. They found that twenty percent of Spanish males have Y-chromosomes associated with Sephardic Jewish ancestry.<ref>{{cite news |first=Nicholas |last=Wade |title=Gene Test Shows Spain's Jewish and Muslim Mix |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=5 December 2008 |page=A12 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/05/science/05genes.html |url-access=subscription }}</ref> This may imply that there were more forced conversions than was previously thought.\n\nThere are also thought to be many Catholic-professing descendants of [[marrano]]s and Spanish-speaking [[Crypto-Judaism|crypto-Jews]] in the [[Southwestern United States]] and scattered through Hispanic America. Additionally, there are Sephardic Jews who are descendants of those Jews who fled Spain to Turkey, [[Syria]], and North Africa, some of whom have now migrated to Hispanic America, holding on to some Spanish/Sephardic customs, such as the [[Judaeo-Spanish|Ladino]] language, which mixes Spanish, Hebrew, Arabic and others, though written with Hebrew and Latin characters.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Ladino |title=Ladino |work=Online Etymology Dictionary |accessdate=19 January 2016}}</ref> [[Slavery|Ladinos]] were also African slaves captive in Spain held prior to the colonial period in the Americas. (See also [[History of the Jews in Latin America|History of the Jews in Hispanic America]] and [[List of Latin American Jews|List of Hispanic American Jews]].)\n\nAmong the Spanish-speaking Catholics, most communities celebrate their homeland's [[patron saint]], dedicating a day for this purpose with festivals and religious services. Some Spanish-speakers syncretize Roman Catholicism and African or Native American rituals and beliefs. Such is the case of [[Santer\u00eda]], popular with [[Afro-Cuban]]s, which combines old African beliefs in the form of Roman Catholic saints and rituals. Other syncretistic beliefs include [[Spiritism]] and [[Curandero|Curanderismo]].\n\nWhile a tiny minority, there are some Muslims in Latin America, in the US, and in the Philippines. Those in the Philippines live predominantly in the province forming the [[Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao]].\n\nIn the United States, some 65% of Hispanics and Latinos report themselves Catholic and 21% Protestant, with 13% having no affiliation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pewtrusts.org/pdf/religion_hispanic_churches.pdf |title=Hispanic Churches in American Public Life: Summary of Findings |accessdate=27 December 2006 |date=January 2003 |last1=Espinosa |first1=Gast\u00f3n |last2=Elizondo |first2=Virgilio |last3=Miranda |first3=Jesse |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061101044854/http://www.pewtrusts.org/pdf/religion_hispanic_churches.pdf |archivedate=1 November 2006}}</ref> A minority among the Roman Catholics, about one in five, are [[charismatic Christianity|charismatics]].

Censorship for such purposes is most common on [[reality television]] series.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\nImage:Pixelization mosaic.jpg|Pixelization was used to anonymize this photograph.\nFile:Marshall Webb and Pixelated Classified Document.jpg#filelinks|[[Marshall B.

In this updated print, the image of the large ocean wave shifts from the traditional style of the Japanese [[woodcut]] print to a pixelized image and finally to a [[wireframe model]] [[computer graphics]] image.<ref>vorpal.us: [http://vorpal.us/2007/07/wave-of-the-future-is-now-the-past/ \"Wave of the Future is now the Past\"].

Censor bars were extensively used as a graphic device in the January 2012 [[protests against SOPA and PIPA]].\n\nA drawback of pixelization is that any differences between the large pixels can be exploited in moving images to reconstruct the original, unpixelized image;<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Newton |first1=EM |last2=Sweeney |first2=L |last3=Malin |first3=B |title=Preserving privacy by de-identifying face images |journal=IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering |date=Jan 2005 |volume=17 |doi=10.1109/TKDE.2005.32 |url=https://dataprivacylab.org/dataprivacy/projects/video/paper.pdf}}</ref> squinting at a pixelized, moving image can sometimes achieve a similar result. In both cases, integration of the large pixels over time allows smaller, more accurate pixels to be constructed in a still image result.  Completely obscuring the censored area with pixels of a constant color or pixels of random colors escapes this drawback but can be more aesthetically jarring.\n\n==International legal standards==\n[[Nudity]] is obscured on [[television network]]s in the United States. [[Pornography in Japan|Japanese pornography]] laws require that genitals in films (including animated works) and other forms of adult media (such as [[eroge]], drawings, etc) be obscured. In Thailand, restrictions are placed on television broadcast depiction of cigarettes being smoked,<ref>2Bangkok.com: [http://www.2bangkok.com/2bangkok/Simpsons/SimpsonsSmoking.shtml \"Smoking on Thai TV\"] Retrieved February 15, 2007</ref> alcohol being consumed, or guns being pointed at people. Pixelization is one method of censoring this content; otherwise, [[censor bar]]s are used.\n\nIn the Philippines, pixelization is also used if there are scenes of naked people or [[cadaver]]s, bloody depiction of death by any means (e.g. gunshot wounds) and exposure of innards (sometimes rendered in black and white and blurred), and [[The finger|the finger gesture]], among objectionable content.\nHowever, nudity and some bloody scenes are cut entirely and pointing of guns or blades to oneself or others are cropped.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Bleep censor]]\n* [[Colour banding]]\n* [[Fogging (censorship)]], an alternate technique<!-- Add to Alternative techniques section. -->\n* [[Posterization]]\n* [[Reverse video]]\n* [[Tape delay (broadcasting)]]\n* Use of pixelation in camouflage patterns such as [[MARPAT]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category}}\n{{Wiktionary|pixelization|pixelisation}}\n{{Censorship}}\n* [http://www.facepixelizer.com Facepixelizer - Online editor for pixelizing parts of an image]\n\n[[Category:Censorship of broadcasting]]\n[[Category:Digital art]]\n[[Category:Self-censorship]]\n", "name_user": "Qwertyxp2000", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eAs censorship:it sounded as though the article wants you to watch the COPS show.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixelization"}
