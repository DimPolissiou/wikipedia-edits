On  21 April 1967, a group of colonels [[1967 Greek coup d'\u00e9tat|overthrew]] the caretaker government a month before  [[1967 Greek legislative election|scheduled elections]] which [[Georgios Papandreou]]'s [[Center Union]] was favored to win. The [[dictatorship]] was characterised by right-wing cultural policies, restrictions on [[civil liberties]], and the imprisonment, torture, and exile of [[Greek anti-junta movement|political opponents]]. An attempt to renew its support in a [[1973 Greek referendum|1973 referendum on the monarchy]] and gradual democratisation was ended by another coup by hardliner [[ Dimitrios Ioannidis]]. The junta's rule ended on 24 July 1974 under the pressure of the [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus]], leading to the [[Metapolitefsi]] (\"regime change\") to democracy and the establishment of the [[Third Hellenic Republic]].\n\n==Background==\n{{See also|Greek Civil War}}\n\nThe 1967 coup and the following seven years of military rule were the culmination of 30 years of national division between the forces of the [[Left wing politics|left]] and the [[Right wing politics|right]], that can be traced to the time of the [[Greek Resistance|resistance against Axis occupation]] of Greece during [[World War II]]. After the liberation in 1944, Greece descended into a civil war, fought between the communist forces and the now-returned [[Greek government in exile|government-in-exile]].\n\n===American influence in Greece===\n{{Main|Operation Gladio#Greece}}In 1944 British Prime Minister Winston Churchill determined to halt the Soviet encroachment in the Balkans, and ordered British forces to intervene in the Greek Civil War (see [[Dekemvriana]]) in the wake of the retreating German military. This was to be a lengthy and open ended commitment. The [[United States]] stepped in to help after 1947 the Greek government against the communist forces. [[File:21april1967.png|180px|thumb|The [[Phoenix (mythology)|Phoenix]] rising from its flames and the silhouette of the soldier bearing a rifle with fixed bayonet was the emblem of the Junta.

The [[Communist Party of Greece]] (KKE) and its ancillary organizations were outlawed ([[s:\u039d\u03cc\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 509/1947|Law 509/1947]]), and many Communists either fled the country or faced persecution. The CIA and the Greek military began to work together closely, especially after Greece joined the North Atlantic Treaty Organization ([[NATO]]) in 1952. This included notable CIA officers [[Gust Avrakotos]] and [[Clair George]]. Avrakotos maintained a close relationship with the colonels who would figure in the later coup.<ref name=crile>Charlie Wilson's War, George Crile, 2003, Grove/Atlantic.</ref> \n\nIn 1952, IDEA issued a manifesto stating that a dictatorship was the only possible solution to Greece's problems, which the Greek scholar Christos Kassimeris called an \"astonishing\" statement since the Communists had been defeated in 1949, Greece was enjoying relative prosperity after living standards had collapsed in the 1940s, and Greek politics were stable.<ref>Kassimeris, Christos ''Greece and the American Embrace: Greek Foreign Policy Towards Turkey, the US and the Western Alliance'', London: I.B.Tauris, 2009 p.75</ref> Kassimeris argued that since Papadopoulos played a large role in writing the 1952 manifesto, that it was his \"personal ambition\" rather than an objective fear of the Greek Communists that was driving him forward because in no way could Greece be presented as being on the brink of a Communist take-over in 1952.<ref>Kassimeris, Christos ''Greece and the American Embrace: Greek Foreign Policy Towards Turkey, the US and the Western Alliance'', London: I.B.Tauris, 2009 p.75</ref>    \n\nGreece was a vital link in the NATO defense arc which extended from the eastern border of Iran to the northernmost point in [[Norway]]. Greece in particular was seen as being at risk, having experienced a communist insurgency. In particular, the newly founded [[Hellenic National Intelligence Service]] (EYP) and the [[Mountain Raiding Companies]] (LOK) maintained a very close liaison with their American counterparts. In addition to preparing for a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] invasion, they agreed to guard against a left-wing ''coup''. The LOK in particular were integrated into the European [[stay-behind]] network.<ref>Ganser, Daniele (2005). ''NATO's secret armies: Operation Gladio and Terrorism in Western Europe.''

In a bid to gain more control over the country's government than his limited constitutional powers allowed, the young and inexperienced King [[Constantine II of Greece|Constantine II]] clashed with liberal reformers. In July 1964, Papandreou announced his intention to fire those officers belonging to IDEA, whom the king did not want dismissed, claiming it was his royal prerogative to protect the IDEA officers, which in turn led to massive demonstrations in Athens, which had a republican favor.<ref>Kassimeris, Christos ''Greece and the American Embrace: Greek Foreign Policy Towards Turkey, the US and the Western Alliance'', London: I.B.Tauris, 2009 p.46</ref> The king dismissed Papandreou in 1965 and causing a [[constitutional crisis]] known as the \"Apostasia of 1965\".\n\nAfter making several attempts to form governments, relying on dissident Centre Union and conservative MPs, Constantine II appointed an interim government under [[Ioannis Paraskevopoulos]], and new elections were called for 28 May 1967. There were many indications that Papandreou's Centre Union would emerge as the largest party, but would not be able to form a single-party government and would be forced into an alliance with the [[United Democratic Left]], which was suspected by conservatives of being a proxy for the banned KKE. This possibility was used as a pretext for the ''coup''.\n\n===A \"Generals' ''Coup''\"===\nGreek historiography and journalists have hypothesized about a \"Generals' ''Coup''\",<ref name=\"Greek historiography\">Marios Ploritis, [http://tovima.dolnet.gr/print_article.php?e=B&f=13138&m=B02&aa=2 \"\u0394\u03b9\u03bf\u03b3\u03ad\u03bd\u03b7\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03ac\u03bd\u03b1\u03ba\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929122034/http://tovima.dolnet.gr/print_article.php?e=B&f=13138&m=B02&aa=2 |date=29 September 2007}}, To Vima, 10 December 2000, (in Greek).</ref> a coup that would have been deployed at Constantine's behest under the pretext of combating communist subversion.<ref name=\"Greek press article\">Stilis Alatos, [http://ta-nea.dolnet.gr/print_article.php?e=A&f=18465&m=N56&aa=2 \"T\u03b1 \u03ba\u03b1\u03bc\u03c0\u03bf\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03ba\u03b1\"]{{dead link |date=April 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}}, Ta Nea, 15 February 2007, (in Greek).</ref><ref name=\"Sulzberger1973\">C.

One such politician, [[George Rallis]], proposed that, in case of such an \"anomaly\", the King should declare [[martial law]] as the monarchist constitution permitted him. According to Rallis, Constantine was receptive to the idea.<ref name=\"Rallis\">Alexis Papachelas, \"Everything George Rallis recounted to me\", ''To Vima'', 19 March 2006</ref>\n\nAccording to U.S. diplomat John Day, Washington also worried that Andreas Papandreou would have a very powerful role in the next government, because of his father's old age. According to Robert Keely and John Owens, American diplomats present in Athens at the time, Constantine asked U.S. Ambassador [[Phillips Talbot|William Phillips Talbot]] what the American attitude would be to an extra-parliamentary solution to the problem. To this the embassy responded negatively in principle \u2013 adding, however, that, \"U.S. reaction to such a move cannot be determined in advance but would depend on circumstances at the time.\" Constantine denies this.<ref name=\"RWFKing1\">TV documentary \"[http://www.rwf.gr/episode1-new.php?id=198 \u03a4\u0391 \u0394\u0399\u039a\u0391 \u039c\u0391\u03a3 60's \u2014 \u039c\u03ad\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 3\u03bf: \u03a7\u0391\u039c\u0395\u039d\u0397 \u0391\u039d\u039f\u0399\u039e\u0397] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080406222452/http://www.rwf.gr/episode1-new.php?id=198 |date=6 April 2008}}\" by Stelios Kouloglu</ref> According to Talbot, Constantine met the army generals, who promised him that they would not take any action before the coming elections. However, the proclamations of Andreas Papandreou made them nervous, and they resolved to re-examine their decision after seeing the results of the elections.<ref name=\"RWFKing1\"/>\n\nIn 1966, Constantine sent his envoy, Demetrios Bitsios, to [[Paris]] on a mission to persuade former prime minister [[Constantine Karamanlis]] to return to Greece and resume his prior role in politics. According to uncorroborated claims made by the former monarch, Karamanlis replied to Bitsios that he would return only if the King imposed martial law, as was his constitutional prerogative.<ref name=\"Konstantinos speaks\">Alexis Papachelas, \"Constantine Speaks\", ''To Vima'', 29 January 2006.</ref> According to ''[[New York Times]]'' correspondent [[Cyrus Leo Sulzberger II|Cyrus L. Sulzberger]], Karamanlis flew to [[New York City]] to meet with [[United States Air Force|USAF]] General [[Lauris Norstad]] to lobby for a conservative coup that would establish himself as Greece's leader; Sulzberger alleges that Norstad declined to involve himself in such affairs.<ref name=\"Sulzberger1974\">C.L.

At the same time, a large number of small mobile units were dispatched to arrest leading politicians, authority figures, and  ordinary citizens suspected of left-wing sympathies, according to lists prepared in advance. One of the first to be arrested was Lieutenant General [[Grigorios Spandidakis]], Commander-in-Chief of the [[Greek Army]]. The colonels persuaded Spandidakis to join them, having him activate a [[Operation Gladio#Greece|previously-drafted action plan]] to move the coup forward. Under the command of paratrooper Brigadier General Kostas Aslanides, the [[1st Raider/Paratrooper Brigade (Greece)|LOK]] took over the [[Minister for National Defence (Greece)|Greek Defence Ministry]] while Pattakos gained control of communication centers, the [[Hellenic Parliament|parliament]], the [[Presidential Mansion, Athens|royal palace]], and \u2013 according to detailed lists \u2013 arrested over 10,000 people.<ref name=\"Ganser\"/>\n\nBy the early morning hours, the whole of Greece was in the hands of the colonels. All leading politicians, including acting Prime Minister [[Panagiotis Kanellopoulos]], had been arrested and were held incommunicado by the conspirators. At 6:00&nbsp;a.m. [[Eastern European Time|EET]], Papadopoulos announced that eleven articles of the [[Greek constitution]] were suspended.<ref name=\"Ganser\"/> One of the consequences of these suspensions was that anyone could be arrested without warrant at any time and brought before a [[military court]] to be tried.

It was a simple, diabolical plan\".<ref name=\"Ganser\"/>\n\nGeorgios Papandreou was arrested after a nighttime raid at his villa in [[Kastri, Attica]]. Andreas was arrested at around the same time, after seven soldiers armed with fixed [[bayonet]]s and a [[machine gun]] forcibly entered his home. Andreas Papandreou escaped to the roof of his house, but surrendered after one of the soldiers held a gun to the head of his then-fourteen-year-old son [[George Papandreou]]. There has been unconfirmed speculation that <ref name=\"Ganser\"/> [[Gust Avrakotos]], a high-ranking CIA officer in Greece who was close with the colonels, advised them to \"shoot the motherfucker because he's going to come back to haunt you\".<ref name=crile />\n\nU.S. critics of the coup included then-Senator [[Lee Metcalf]], who criticised the [[Lyndon B. Johnson Administration|Johnson Administration]] for providing aid to a \"military regime of collaborators and Nazi sympathisers\". [[Phillips Talbot]], the U.S. ambassador in Athens, disapproved of the coup, complaining that it represented \"a rape of democracy\", to which John M. Maury, the CIA station chief in Athens, answered, \"How can you rape a whore?\"<ref name=\"Ganser\">Ganser Daniele (2005).

Vatican agents who handed over $ 4 million to Georgios Papadopoulos through an intricate network of banks, as they feared the election of [[Andreas Papandreou]], a leftist politician accused of having sympathies for [[communism]].<ref>Frattini, Eric. The Entity: Five Centuries of Secret Vatican Espionage, St. Martin's Press; 1st U.S. Ed edition, 2008, p. 303-304. {{ISBN|0-3123-7594-8}} </ref>\n\n===Role of the King===\n{{Main|Constantine II of Greece}}\n\nWhen the tanks came to the streets of Athens on 21 April, the legitimate National Radical Union government, of which Rallis was a member, asked King Constantine to immediately mobilise the state against the coup; he declined to do so, and swore in the dictators as the legitimate government of Greece.\n\nThe King, who had relented and decided to co-operate, claims to this day that he was isolated and did not know what else to do. He has since claimed that he was trying to gain time to organise a counter-coup and oust the Junta. He did organise such a counter-coup; however, the fact that the new government had a legal sanction, in that it had been appointed by the legitimate head of state, played an important role in the coup's success. The King was later to regret his decision bitterly. For many Greeks, it served to identify him indelibly with the coup and certainly played an important role in the final decision to abolish the monarchy, sanctioned by the 1974 referendum.\n\nThe only concession the King could achieve was to appoint a civilian as prime minister, rather than Spandidakis. [[Konstantinos Kollias]], a former Attorney General of the [[Court of Cassation (Greece)|Areios Pagos]] (supreme court), was chosen. He was a well-known royalist and had even been disciplined under the Papandreou government for meddling in the investigation of the murder of MP [[Gregoris Lambrakis]]. Kollias was little more than a figurehead and real power rested with the army, and especially Papadopoulos, who emerged as the coup's strong man and became Minister to the Presidency of the Government. Other coup members occupied key posts.\n\nUp until then constitutional legitimacy had been preserved, since under the Greek Constitution the King could appoint whomever he wanted as prime minister, as long as Parliament endorsed the appointment with a vote of confidence or a general election was called. It was this government, sworn-in during the early evening hours of 21 April, that formalised the coup. It adopted a \"Constituent Act\", an amendment tantamount to a revolution, cancelling the elections and effectively abolishing the constitution, which would be replaced later.\n\nIn the meantime, the government was to rule by decree. Since traditionally such Constituent Acts did not need to be signed by the Crown, the King never signed it, permitting him to claim, years later, that he had never signed any document instituting the junta. Critics claim that Constantine II did nothing to prevent the government (and especially his chosen prime minister, Kollias) from legally instituting the authoritarian government to come. This same government published and enforced a decree, already proclaimed on radio as the coup was in progress, instituting military law. Constantine claimed he never signed that decree either.\n\n===King's counter-coup===\nFrom the outset, the relationship between Constantine and the colonels was an uneasy one. The colonels were not willing to share power, whereas the young king, like his father before him, was used to playing an active role in politics and would never consent to being a mere figurehead, especially in a military administration. Although the colonels' strong anti-communist, pro-NATO, and pro-Western views appealed to the United States, [[President of the United States|President]] [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] \u2013 in an attempt to avoid an international backlash \u2013 told Constantine that it would be best to replace the junta with a new government according to Paul Ioannidis in his book ''Destiny Prevails: My life with Arist\u00f3teles Onassis''. Constantine took that as an encouragement to organize a counter-coup, although no direct help or involvement of the U.S. (or Britain)<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Nafpliotis|first1=Alexandros|title=\"A gift from God\": Anglo-Greek relations during the dictatorship of the Greek colonels|journal=The Historical Review/La Revue Historique|date=December 2014|volume=11|pages=77\u201378|doi=10.12681/hr.329|doi-access=free}}</ref> was forthcoming.\n\nThe King finally decided to launch his counter-coup on 13 December 1967. Since Athens was militarily in the hands of the colonels, Constantine decided to fly to the small northern city of [[Kavala]], where he hoped to be among troops loyal only to him. The vague plan that Constantine and his advisors had conceived was to form a unit that would invade and take control over [[Thessaloniki]], where an alternative administration would be installed. Constantine hoped that international recognition and internal pressure between the two governments would force the junta to resign, leaving the field clear for him to return triumphant to Athens.\n\nIn the early morning hours of 13 December, the King boarded the royal plane, together with [[Queen Anne-Marie of Greece|Queen Anne-Marie]], their two baby children [[Princess Alexia of Greece and Denmark|Princess Alexia]] and [[Pavlos, Crown Prince of Greece|Crown Prince Pavlos]], his mother [[Frederika of Hanover|Frederika]], and his sister, [[Princess Irene of Greece and Denmark|Princess Irene]]. Constantine also took with him Prime Minister Kollias. At first, things seemed to be going according to plan. Constantine was well received in Kavala, which was under the command of a general loyal to him. The [[Hellenic Air Force]] and [[Hellenic Navy|Navy]], both strongly royalist and not involved in the junta, immediately declared for him and mobilised. Another of Constantine's generals effectively cut all communication between Athens and northern Greece.\n\nHowever, Constantine's plans were overly bureaucratic, na\u00efvely supposing that orders from a commanding general would automatically be obeyed.\n\nIn the circumstances, middle-ranking pro-junta officers neutralised and arrested Constantine's royalist generals and took command of their units, and subsequently put together a force to advance on Kavala to arrest the King. The junta, not at all shaken by the loss of their figurehead premier, ridiculed Constantine by announcing that he was hiding \"from village to village\". Realising that the counter-coup had failed, Constantine fled Greece on board the royal plane, taking his family and the helpless Kollias with him. They landed in [[Rome]] early in the morning of 14 December. Constantine remained in exile all through the rest of military rule. Even though he would return to Greece, the country's abolition of the monarchy in 1973 stripped him of his status as King.\n\n===Regency===\nThe flight of Constantine and Kollias left Greece with no legal government or head of state. This did not concern the military junta. Instead the Revolutionary Council, composed of Pattakos, Papadopoulos, and Makarezos, appointed another member to the military administration, Major General [[Georgios Zoitakis]], as [[Regent of Greece|Regent]]. Zoitakis then appointed Papadopoulos as prime minister. This became the only government of Greece following the failure of the King's attempted counter-coup, as Constantine was unwilling to set up an alternative administration in exile. \n\nIn hopes of giving legal sanction to the regime, the junta drafted a [[Greek Constitution of 1968|new constitution]]. It made the military the guardians of \"social and political order,\" with wide autonomy from governmental and parliamentary oversight. It also heavily circumscribed the activities of political parties. The new constitution was approved in a [[Greek constitutional referendum, 1968|15 November referendum]], with over 92 percent approval. However, the referendum was conducted in less-than-free circumstances; the regime deployed extensive propaganda in favour of the new document while muzzling any opposition. Under the new constitution, the regency would continue until elections were held, unless the junta called Constantine back sooner (though Constantine never acknowledged, let alone recognised, the regency). However, the junta announced that the \"Revolution of April 21\" (as the regime called itself) would need time to reform the \"Greek mentality\" before holding elections. It also suspended most of the constitution's guarantees of civil rights until the restoration of civilian rule.\n\nIn a legally controversial move, even under the junta's own Constitution, the Cabinet voted on 21 March 1972 to oust Zoitakis and replace him with Papadopoulos, thus combining the offices of Regent and Prime Minister. It was thought Zoitakis was problematic and interfered too much with the military. The King's portrait remained on coins, in public buildings, etc., but slowly, the military chipped away at the institution of the monarchy: the royal family's tax immunity was abolished, the complex network of royal charities was brought under direct state control, the royal arms were removed from coins, the Navy and Air Force dropped their \"Royal\" names, and newspapers were prohibited from publishing the King's photo or any interviews.\n\nDuring this period, resistance against the colonels' rule became better organized among exiles in Europe and the United States. There was also considerable political infighting within the junta. Still, up until 1973, the junta appeared in firm control of Greece, and not likely to be ousted by violent means.\n\n==Characteristics of the Junta==\n\n===Ideology===\n[[File:Flag of Greece (1970-1975).svg|thumb|National flag adopted by the colonels (1970\u20131974). It was the old flag of the [[Hellenic Navy|Navy]], but featured a darker shade of blue.]]\n\nThe colonels preferred to call the coup a \"revolution to save the nation\" (''\"Ethnosotirios Epanastasis\"''). Their official justification was that a \"communist conspiracy\" had infiltrated Greece's bureaucracy, academia, press, and military, to such an extent that drastic action was needed to protect the country from communist takeover. Thus, the defining characteristic of the Junta was its staunch [[anti-communism]]. They used the term [[anarcho-communist]] (\u03b1\u03bd\u03b1\u03c1\u03c7\u03bf\u03ba\u03bf\u03bc\u03bc\u03bf\u03c5\u03bd\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03af ''anarchokommounistai'') to describe leftists in general. In a similar vein, the junta attempted to steer Greek public opinion not only by [[propaganda]] but also by inventing [[Glossary of the Greek military junta|new words]] and slogans, such as ''old-partyism'' (''palaiokommatismos'') to discredit [[parliamentary democracy]], or ''[[Glossary of the Greek military junta|Greece for Christian Greeks]]'' (''Ellas Ellinon Christianon'') to underscore its ideology. The junta's main ideological spokesmen included [[Georgios Georgalas]] and journalist [[Savvas Konstantopoulos]], both former [[Marxism|Marxists]]. \n\nIn 1970, Georgalas published a book ''The Decline of Consumer Society'', stating the consumerism had destroyed the Christian spiritual values of the West, leaving Greece as the last solitary outpost of Christian civilization.<ref>Clogg, Richard \"The Ideology of the \"revolution of 21 April 1967'\" p.36-58 from ''Greece Under Military Rule'' edited by Richard Clogg & George Yannopoloulos; London: Secker & Warburg, 1971 p.43.</ref> In the same book, Georgalas stated the solution to social problems was not as many believed increased employment, but instead \"lengthy psycho-therapeutic programmes\" which would create \"the free man in harmonious co-existence with himself and his fellow beings\".<ref>Clogg, Richard \"The Ideology of the \"revolution of 21 April 1967'\" p.36-58 from ''Greece Under Military Rule'' edited by Richard Clogg & George Yannopoloulos; London: Secker & Warburg, 1971 p.43-44.</ref> The British historian Richard Clogg described the writings of Georgalas and Konstantopoluos as \"pretentious verbiage\", noting that they tended to use elaborate and impressive-sounding language to mask the shallowness of their theories.<ref>Clogg, Richard \"The Ideology of the \"revolution of 21 April 1967'\" p.36-58 from ''Greece Under Military Rule'' edited by Richard Clogg & George Yannopoloulos; London: Secker & Warburg, 1971 p.43.</ref> In essence, intellectuals like Georgalas and Konstantopoulos  argued that materialism and consumerism was corroding the spiritual strength of the Greek people, and the military regime would \"cure\" the Greeks by restoring the traditional values of Orthodoxy.<ref>Clogg, Richard \"The Ideology of the \"revolution of 21 April 1967'\" p.36-58 from ''Greece Under Military Rule'' edited by Richard Clogg & George Yannopoloulos; London: Secker & Warburg, 1971 p.43-44.</ref> One of Papadopoulos' first acts after the coup was to change the pension laws to allow the veterans of the Security Battalions to collect pensions.<ref>Simpson, Christoper ''Blowback: America's Recruitment of Nazis and Its Effects on the Cold War'', London: Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 1988 p.82</ref>\n\nA central part of the regime's ideology was xenophobia, which presented Greeks of the creators of civilization with the rest of the world jealous of the debts they owed to Greece.<ref>Clogg, Richard \"The Ideology of the \"revolution of 21 April 1967'\" p.36-58 from ''Greece Under Military Rule'' edited by Richard Clogg & George Yannopoloulos; London: Secker & Warburg, 1971 p.41.</ref> Colonel [[Ioannis Ladas]], the Secretary-general of the Ministry of Public Order, came to international prominence in the summer of 1968 when he personally beat up Panayiotis Lambrias,  the editor of magazine ''Eikones'' for running an article saying that homosexuality was accepted as normal in ancient Greece.<ref>Clogg, Richard \"The Ideology of the \"revolution of 21 April 1967'\" p.36-58 from ''Greece Under Military Rule'' edited by Richard Clogg & George Yannopoloulos; London: Secker & Warburg, 1971 p.41.</ref> When the BBC's Greek service reported the incident, Ladas gave a rant at a press conference, claiming that the BBC was run by homosexuals, making him into a sort of unofficial spokesman for the regime.<ref>Clogg, Richard \"The Ideology of the \"revolution of 21 April 1967'\" p.36-58 from ''Greece Under Military Rule'' edited by Richard Clogg & George Yannopoloulos; London: Secker & Warburg, 1971 p.41.</ref> \n\nAt a subsequent speech before a visiting group of Greek-Americans on 6 August 1968, Ladas quoted Friderich Nietzsche's statement that the ancient Greeks invented everything and went on to say: \"Foreigners confess and acknowledge Greek superiority.

This realisation, including the absence of any [[civil rights]] as well as maltreatment during police arrest, ranging from threats to beatings or worse, made life under the junta a difficult proposition for many ordinary citizens. Photography by ordinary citizens was banned in public locations.\n\nThe junta allowed citizens to participate in ordinary societal events that reflected those of the United States and United Kingdom, such as rock concerts for example. However, citizens lived in extreme fear, as any behavior that the junta disapproved of, coupled with the complete absence of any civil rights or freedoms, could easily result in torture, beatings, exile, imprisonment or worse, and the labeling of the victim as \u03b1\u03bd\u03b1\u03c1\u03c7\u03bf\u03ba\u03bf\u03bc\u03bc\u03bf\u03c5\u03bd\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03af, \"anarchocommunists\", or worse.

The son of a poor but educated rural family, he was educated at the prestigious [[Hellenic Military Academy]]. Papadopoulos allowed substantial social and cultural freedoms to all [[social class]]es, but political [[oppression]] and [[censorship]] were at times heavy-handed, especially in areas deemed sensitive by the junta, such as political activities, and politically related art, literature, film and music. [[Costa Gavras|Kostas Gavras's]] film ''[[Z (1969 film)|Z]]'' and [[Mikis Theodorakis]]'s music, among others, were never allowed even during the most relaxed times of the dictatorship, and an index of prohibited songs, literature and art was kept.\n\n====Western music and film====\nRemarkably, after some initial hesitation and as long as they were not deemed to be politically damaging to the junta, junta censors allowed wide access to Western music and films.

The regime sponsored song contests and concerts featuring folk musicians throughout its existence. The favored types of music employed by the government were those which accompanied the [[Kalamatianos]] and [[Tsamiko]] folk dances. Additionally, the regime encouraged the production of new folk songs with lyrics praising the government and its leaders, like Georgios Papadopoulos. Because the [[clarinet]] was so strongly featured in the music of the Junta, it remains associated with the Colonels by many Greeks today. The ideology behind the promotion of folk music was twofold: to bridge the gap of continuity with Greece's past and present, and to limit foreign cultural influences such as [[psychedelic music]] (which could hold political connotations contrary to those of the Junta) by substituting them with traditionally Greek ones. Folk music was also used as an ideological weapon against dissidents, and it was played constantly in detention centers to help break prisoners.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Papaeti |first1=Anna |last2= |first2= |date=January 2015 |title=Folk Music and the Cultural Policies of the Military Junta in Greece |url=https://soundscapesofdetention.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/2.2-m-logos-i0002-a0022-papaeti_with-corrections.pdf |journal=Mousikos Logos |volume= |issue=2 |pages= |issn=1108-6963 |access-date=15 October 2019 }}</ref>\n\n====Greek rock====\nIn the early days of the dictatorship, Western music broadcasts were limited from the airwaves in favour of [[martial music]], but this was eventually relaxed.

[[tourism]] was actively encouraged by Papadopoulos' government and, funding scandals notwithstanding, there was  great development of the tourist sector. With tourism came nightlife. However, under Papadopoulos, in the absence of any civil rights these sociocultural freedoms existed in a legal vacuum that meant they were not guaranteed, but rather dispensed at the whim of the junta. In addition any transgressing into political matters during social or cultural activities usually meant arrest and punishment. Tourism was furthered by the [[1969 European Championships in Athletics]] in Athens which showed political normality. Even the boycott of the West German team was not directed against the junta, but against its own team leadership.<ref>[[Arnd Kr\u00fcger]]. \"A Cultural Revolution?

He cultivated this relationship by appealing to them, calling them \"the backbone of the people\" ({{lang-el|\u03b7 \u03c1\u03b1\u03c7\u03bf\u03ba\u03bf\u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u03b9\u03ac \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u03bb\u03b1\u03bf\u03cd}}) and cancelling all agricultural loans.<ref name=\"Google Book\">Michel Fors\u00e9.

Although the way in which loans were being provided and their uncontrollable use constituted the introduction to the process of de-industrialization which begins with the Ioannidis period. The collapse of the dictatorship, due to the nationalist fury of the last period, the Ioannidis period, led to the collapse of the compulsive interconnections of power that the civil war and its consequences had shaped.\" p. 12 {{ISBN|0-7735-0887-2}}</ref><ref>Dimitris Charalambis, Laura Maratou-Alipranti, and Andromachi Hadjiyanni.

McGill-Queen's Press, 2004 {{ISBN|978-0-7735-2202-2}}.</ref> By further insisting on promoting, but not really enforcing for fear of middle-class backlash, religion and patriotism, he further appealed to the simpler ideals of rural Greece and strengthened his image as people's champion among farmers, who tended to ridicule the middle class. Furthermore, the regime promoted a policy of economic development in rural areas, which were mostly neglected by the previous governments, that had focused largely on urban industrial development.\n\n====Urban classes====\nPapadopoulos was less likely to appeal to the largely civilian and city-oriented middle class, since he was a military man from a rural background. In addition, he had promised from the beginning that the dictatorship would not be permanent, and that when political order was established democratic rule would return.<ref name=\"The Metapolitefsi that never was\"/> On top of that, his promotion of tourism and other beneficial economic measures and the fact that, with the notable exceptions of political freedoms and press censorship, he did not otherwise substantially restrict the middle class, had the effect of assisting the junta in establishing its control over the country by gaining, at least initially, the reluctant acquiescence of some key segments of the population.\n\n===Economic policies===\nThe 1967\u20131973 period was marked by high rates of economic growth coupled with low inflation and low unemployment. Economic growth was driven by investment in the [[tourism industry]], loose emigration policies, public spending, and pro-business incentives that fostered both domestic and foreign capital spending. Several international companies invested in Greece at the time, including [[The Coca-Cola Company]]. Economic growth started losing steam by 1972.<ref name=\"The Metapolitefsi that never was\"/>\n\nIn addition, large scale construction of [[Hydroelectricity|hydroelectric dam]] projects, such as in [[Haliacmon|Aliakmon]], Kastrakion, Polyphytos, the expansion of [[thermoelectric]] generation units and other significant infrastructure development, took place. The junta used to proudly announce these projects with the slogan: \"Greece is a construction zone\" (\u0397 \u0395\u03bb\u03bb\u03ac\u03c2 \u03b5\u03af\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 \u03ad\u03bd\u03b1 \u03b5\u03c1\u03b3\u03bf\u03c4\u03ac\u03be\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd).

One such event is associated with the regime's tourism minister, [[Ioannis Ladas]] ({{lang-el|\u0399\u03c9\u03ac\u03bd\u03bd\u03b7\u03c2 \u039b\u03b1\u03b4\u03ac\u03c2}}). During his administration, several low-interest loans, amortized over a twenty-year period, were issued for tourist development.

This has been attributed to an attempt by Papadopoulos to gain public support for his regime.\n\n\n==Italian connection==\n{{see|Borghese Coup}}\nAt the time, the Italian far right was very impressed with the methods of Papadopoulos and his junta. In April 1968 Papadopoulos invited fifty Italian members of the far right including [[Stefano Delle Chiaie]] on a Greek tour with the purpose of demonstrating to the Italians the methods of the junta.<ref name=\"Ganser\"/> Other invitees included members of [[Ordine Nuovo]], [[Avanguardia Nazionale]], Europa Civilt\u00e0 and FUAN-La Caravella.<ref name=\"Laruelle2015\">{{cite book|author=Marlene Laruelle|title=Eurasianism and the European Far Right: Reshaping the Europe\u2013Russia Relationship|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V9nRCQAAQBAJ&pg=PA103|date=1 July 2015|publisher=Lexington Books|isbn=978-1-4985-1069-1|pages=103\u2013104}}</ref> (cf Frattini, Entity, 2004, p. 304) The Italians were sufficiently impressed that upon return to their country, the operatives of the Italian far right escalated the political violence in their country to a new level embarking on a terror campaign of bombings and other violence which killed and injured hundreds.<ref name=\"Ganser\"/> Afterwards, the right-wing instigators of this violence blamed the communists.<ref name=\"Ganser\"/>\n\nAfter their visit to Greece, the Italian neo-fascists also engaged in [[false flag]] operations and embarked on a campaign of infiltration of leftist, anarchist and Marxist\u2013Leninist organisations.<ref name=\"Laruelle2015\"/> One of the neo-fascists conducted frequent provocations and infiltrations in the months leading to the [[Piazza Fontana bombing]] on 12 December 1969.<ref name=\"Laruelle2015\"/> The Greek junta was so impressed with the manner their Italian counterparts were paving the way toward an Italian coup d'\u00e9tat that on 15 May 1969 Papadopoulos sent them a congratulatory message stating that \"His Excellency the Prime Minister notes that the efforts that have been undertaken by the Greek National government in Italy for some time start to have some impact\".<ref name=\"Ganser\"/>\n\n== Anti-Junta movement ==\n{{refimprove section|date=April 2012}}\n[[File:Panagoulisontrial.jpg|250px|thumb|[[Alexandros Panagoulis]] on trial in front of the junta justice system]]\n\nThe democratic elements of the Greek society were opposed to the junta from the start. In 1968 many militant groups promoting democratic rule were formed, both in exile and in Greece. These included, among others, [[Panhellenic Liberation Movement]], [[Democratic Defense]], the [[Socialist Democratic Union]], as well as groups from the entire left wing of the Greek political spectrum, including the [[Communist Party of Greece]] which had been outlawed even before the junta. The first armed action against the junta was the failed assassination attempt against [[Georgios Papadopoulos|George Papadopoulos]] by [[Alexandros Panagoulis]], on 13 August 1968.\n\n===Assassination attempt by Panagoulis===\nThe assassination attempt took place on the morning of 13 August, when Papadopoulos went from his summer residence in [[Lagonisi]] to [[Athens]], escorted by his personal security motorcycles and cars. Alexandros Panagoulis ignited a bomb at a point of the coastal road where the limousine carrying Papadopoulos would have to slow down, but the bomb failed to harm Papadopoulos. Panagoulis was captured a few hours later in a nearby sea cave, as the boat that would let him escape the scene of the attack had not shown up.\n\nPanagoulis was transferred to the [[Greek Military Police]] (EAT-ESA) offices, where he was questioned, beaten and tortured (see the proceedings of Theofiloyiannakos's trial). On 17 November 1968 he was sentenced to death, and remained in prison for five years. After the restoration of democracy, Panagoulis was elected a Member of Parliament. Panagoulis is regarded as an emblematic figure for the struggle to restore democracy.\n\n===Broadening of the movement===\nThe funeral of [[George Papandreou, Sr.]] on 3 November 1968 spontaneously turned into a massive demonstration against the junta. Thousands of Athenians disobeyed the military's orders and followed the casket to the cemetery. The government reacted by arresting 41 people.\n\nOn 28 March 1969, after two years of widespread censorship, political detentions and torture, [[Giorgos Seferis]], recipient of the [[Nobel Prize for Literature]] in 1963, took a stand against the junta. He made a statement on the [[BBC World Service]],<ref>John Karavidas, [https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=el&u=http://www.bbc.co.uk/greek/seferis.shtml&sa=X&oi=translate&resnum=1&ct=result&prev=/search%3Fq%3D%25CE%25A3%25CE%25B5%25CF%2586%25CE%25AD%25CF%2581%25CE%25B7%25CF%2582%2B%25CF%2587%25CE%25BF%25CF%258D%25CE%25BD%25CF%2584%25CE%25B1%2BBBC%26hl%3Den%26safe%3Doff%26rlz%3D1B3GGGL_enCA205CA242 George Seferis and the BBC], BBC Greek service, translation by Google. Retrieved 6 July 2008</ref> with copies simultaneously distributed to every newspaper in Athens. Attacking the colonels, he passionately demanded that \"This anomaly must end\". Seferis did not live to see the end of the junta. His funeral, though, on 20 September 1972, turned into a massive demonstration against the military government.\n\nAlso in 1969, [[Costa-Gavras]] released the film [[Z (1969 film)|''Z'']], based on a book by celebrated left-wing writer [[Vassilis Vassilikos]]. The film, banned in Greece, presented a lightly fictionalized account of the events surrounding the assassination of [[United Democratic Left]] MP [[Gregoris Lambrakis]] in 1963. The film captured the sense of outrage about the junta. The soundtrack of the film was written by [[Mikis Theodorakis]], who was imprisoned by the junta and later went into exile, and the music was smuggled into the country to be added to the other inspirational, underground Theodorakis tracks.\n\nA lesser known [[Danish language|Danish]] film, in Greek, ''[[Your Neighbor's Son]]'', detailed the subordination and training of simple youths to become torturers for the junta.\n\n===International protest===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-F0503-0204-005, Stuttgart, Maikundgebung.jpg|thumb|Protest against the junta by Greek political exiles in Germany, 1967]]\n\nThe junta exiled thousands on the grounds that they were communists and/or \"enemies of the country\". Most of them were subjected to internal exile on Greek deserted islands, such as [[Makronisos]], [[Gyaros]], [[Gioura]], or inhabited islands such as [[Leros]], [[Agios Eustratios]] or [[Paleo Trikeri|Trikeri]]. \nThe most famous were in external exile, most of whom were substantially involved in the resistance, organising protests in European capital cities, or helping and hiding refugees from Greece.\n\nThese included: [[Melina Mercouri]], actor, singer (and, after 1981 [[Minister for Culture (Greece)|Minister for Culture]]); [[Mikis Theodorakis]], composer of resistance songs; [[Costas Simitis]] ([[Prime Minister of Greece|prime minister]] from 1996 to 2004); [[Andreas Papandreou]] (prime minister from 1981 to 1989 and again from 1993 to 1996); and Lady [[Amalia Fleming]] (wife of Sir [[Alexander Fleming]], philanthropist, political activist).<ref>{{cite book|last=Nafpliotis|first=Alexandros|title=Britain and the Greek Colonels: Accommodating the Junta in the Cold War|year=2012|publisher=I.B.

For example, Melina Mercouri was allowed to enter Greece, but stayed away on her own accord.\n\nIn the early hours of 19 September 1970 in Matteotti square in [[Genoa]], [[geology]] student [[Kostas Georgakis]] set himself ablaze in protest against the dictatorship of George Papadopoulos. The junta delayed the arrival of his remains to [[Corfu#Famous persons associated with Corfu|Corfu]] for four months, fearing public reaction and protests. At the time his death caused a sensation in Greece and abroad as it was the first tangible manifestation of the depth of resistance against the junta. He is the only known anti-junta resistance activist to have sacrificed himself and he is considered the precursor of later student protest, such as the [[Athens Polytechnic uprising]]. The Municipality of Corfu has dedicated a memorial in his honour near his home in [[Corfu (city)|Corfu city]].\n\nIn a speech before the U.S. Senate on 6 November 1971, Senator [[Lee Metcalf]] listed the members of the Greek junta who had served in the collaborationist [[Security Battalions]] and denounced the administration of [[Richard Nixon]] for supporting what he called a \"junta of Nazi collaborators\".<ref>Simpson, Christoper ''America's Recruitment of Nazis and Its Destructive Impact on Our Domestic and Foreign Policy'', London:  Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 1988 p.81-82.</ref> The German writer, [[Investigative journalism|investigative reporter]] and journalist [[G\u00fcnter Wallraff]] traveled to Greece in May 1974. While in [[Syntagma Square]], he protested against human right violations. He was arrested and tortured by the police, as he did not carry, on purpose, any papers on him that could identify him as a foreigner. After his identity was revealed, Wallraff was convicted and sentenced to 14 months in jail. He was released in August, after the end of the dictatorship.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guenter-wallraff.com/biographie.html |title=Biography of G\u00fcnther Wallraff |publisher=Guenter-wallraff.com |date=9 December 1969 |accessdate=18 April 2009}}</ref>\n\n===''Velos'' mutiny===\n[[File:Velos D16.jpg|thumb|250px|The destroyer ''Velos'' ({{lang-el|\u0392\u03ad\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2}}, \"Arrow\"), now a museum ship at [[Palaio Faliro]] in Athens]]\n\nIn an anti-[[military junta|junta]] protest, on 23 May 1973, [[USS Charrette (DD-581)|HNS ''Velos'']], under the command of Commander [[Nikolaos Pappas]], refused to return to Greece after participating in a [[NATO]] exercise and remained anchored at [[Fiumicino, Italy|Fiumicino]], [[Italy]]. During a patrol with other NATO vessels between continental Italy and [[Sardinia]], the commander and the officers heard over the radio that a number of fellow naval officers had been arrested in Greece. Commander Pappas was involved in a group of democratic officers who remained loyal to their oath to obey the Constitution and planned to act against the junta. [[Evangelos Averoff]] also participated in the ''Velos'' mutiny, for which he was later arrested as an \"instigator\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Nafpliotis|first=Alexandros|title=Britain and the Greek Colonels: Accommodating the Junta in the Cold War|year=2012|publisher=I.B.

He therefore decided to act alone in order to motivate global public opinion. He mustered all the crew to the stern and announced his decision, which was received with enthusiasm by the crew.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}\n\nPappas signaled his intentions to the squadron commander and NATO headquarters, quoting the preamble of the [[North Atlantic Treaty]], which declares that \"all governments ... are determined to safeguard the freedom, common heritage and civilisation of their peoples, founded on the principles of democracy, individual liberty and the rule of law\", and, leaving formation, sailed for Rome. There, anchored about {{convert|3.5|nmi|km|0}} away from the coast of Fiumicino, three ensigns sailed ashore with a whaleboat, went to [[Fiumicino Airport]] and telephoned the international press agencies, notifying them of the situation in Greece, the presence of the destroyer, and that the captain would hold a press conference the next day.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}\n\nThis action increased international interest in the situation in Greece.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Nafpliotis|first1=Alexandros|title=\"A gift from God\": Anglo-Greek relations during the dictatorship of the Greek colonels|journal=The Historical Review/La Revue Historique|date=December 2014|volume=11|pages=95\u201396|doi=10.12681/hr.329|doi-access=free}}</ref> The commander, six officers, and twenty five [[petty officer]]s requested permission to remain abroad as political refugees. Indeed, the whole crew wished to follow their commander but were advised by its officers to remain onboard and return to Greece to inform families and friends about what happened. ''Velos'' returned to Greece after a month with a replacement crew. After the fall of the junta all officers and petty officers returned to the Navy.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}\n\n==Collapse==\nThe collapse of the junta both ideologically and politically was triggered by a series of events which unfolded soon after Papadopoulos' attempt at liberalisation, with ideological collapse preceding its eventual political collapse. During and following this ill-fated process the internal political strains of the junta came to the fore and pitted the junta [[Political faction|factions]] against each other, thus destroying the seemingly monolithic cohesion of the dictatorship.\n\nThis had the effect of seriously weakening the coherence of the political message and, consequently, the credibility of the regime, a fatal blow from which, as later events would show, it never recovered. At the same time, during Papadopoulos' attempt at liberalisation, some of the junta constraints were removed from the [[body politic]] of Greece and that led to demands for more freedoms, and political unrest, in a society well used to democratic action prior to the dictatorship.\n\n===Normalization and attempts at liberalization===\n[[File:Presidential Standard of Greece (1973-1974).svg|thumb|right|220px|Presidential standard (1973\u201374)]]\n\nPapadopoulos had indicated as early as 1968 that he was eager for a reform process. He had declared at the time that he did not want the \"Revolution\" ([[Glossary of the Greek military junta|junta speak]] for the \"dictatorship\") to become a \"regime\". He then repeatedly attempted to initiate reforms in 1969 and 1970, only to be thwarted by the hardliners including Ioannidis. In fact subsequent to his 1970 failed attempt at reform, he threatened to resign and was dissuaded only after the hardliners renewed their personal allegiance to him.<ref name=\"The Metapolitefsi that never was\">Ioannis Tzortzis, {{cite web|url=http://www.lse.ac.uk/collections/hellenicObservatory/pdf/TheMetapolitefsiThatNeverWas.pdf |title=The Metapolitefsi that never was |accessdate=2007-06-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070710022854/http://www.lse.ac.uk/collections/hellenicObservatory/pdf/TheMetapolitefsiThatNeverWas.pdf |archivedate=10 July 2007 |df=dmy }} Quote: \"The Americans asked the Greek government to allow the use of their bases in Greek territory and air space to supply [[Israel]]; Markezinis, backed by Papadopoulos, denied on the grounds of maintaining good relations with the Arab countries.

Quote:\"The first attempt of Papadopoulos to start a process of reform occurred in the spring of 1968. He was claiming that if the 'Revolution' stayed more than a certain time in power, it would lose its dynamics and transform into a 'regime', which was not in his intentions. He tried to implicate Markezinis in the attempt; however, he met the stiff resistance of the hard-liners. Another attempt was again frustrated in the end of 1969 and the beginning of 1970; Papadopoulos was then disappointed and complaining \u2018I am being subverted by my fellow Evelpides cadets!\u2019 As a result of this second failure, he considered resigning in the summer of 1970, complaining that he lacked any support from other leading figures, his own closest followers included.

(regime supporters), it was bicameral, composed of the Central Advisory Council and the Provincial Advisory Council. The Central Council met in Athens in the Parliament Building. Both councils had the purpose to advise the dictator. At the time of the announcement of the formation of the council, Papadopoulos explained that he wanted to avoid using the term \"Vouli\" (Parliament) for the Committee because it sounded bad.<ref name=\"Eleftherotypia\"/>\n\nThe council was dissolved just prior to Papadopoulos' failed attempt to liberalise his regime. As internal dissatisfaction grew in the early 1970s, and especially after an abortive coup by the [[Hellenic Navy|Navy]] in early 1973,<ref name=\"The Metapolitefsi that never was\"/> Papadopoulos attempted to legitimize the regime by beginning a gradual \"democratization\" (See also the article on [[Metapolitefsi#Prologue|Metapolitefsi]]).\n\nOn 1 June 1973, he abolished the monarchy and declared Greece a republic with himself as president. He was confirmed in office after [[Greek republic referendum, 1973|a controversial referendum]], the results of which were not recognised by the political parties. He furthermore sought the support of the old political establishment, but secured only the cooperation of [[Spiros Markezinis]], who was appointed Prime Minister. Concurrently, many restrictions were lifted, and the army's role significantly reduced. Papadopoulos intended to establish a [[presidential republic]], with extensive\u2013and within the context of the system, almost dictatorial\u2013powers vested in the office of President, which he held. The decision to return to political rule and the restriction of their role was resented by many of the regime's supporters in the [[Hellenic Army|Army]], whose dissatisfaction with Papadopoulos would become evident a few months later.\n\n===Uprising at the Polytechnic===\n{{Main|Athens Polytechnic uprising}}\n\nPapadopoulos' heavy-handed attempt at liberalisation did not find favour among many in Greece. The stilted democratisation process he proposed was constrained by multiple factors. His inexperience at carrying out an unprecedented political experiment of democratisation was burdened by his tendency to concentrate as much power in his hands as possible, a weakness he exhibited during the junta years when he would sometimes hold multiple high-echelon government portfolios. This especially antagonised the [[intelligentsia]], whose primary exponents were the students. The students at the Law School in Athens, for example, demonstrated multiple times against the dictatorship prior to the events at the Polytechneion.\n\nThe tradition of [[student protest]] was always strong in Greece, even before the dictatorship. Papadopoulos tried hard to suppress and discredit the student movement during his tenure at the helm of the junta. But the liberalisation process he undertook allowed the students to organise more freely, and this gave the opportunity to the students at the [[National Technical University of Athens]] to organise a demonstration that grew progressively larger and more effective. The political momentum was on the side of the students. Sensing this, the junta panicked and reacted violently.<ref>Kostis Kornetis (2013). Children of the Dictatorship. Student Resistance, Cultural Politics and the \"Long 1960s\" in Greece. New York : Berghahn Books.</ref>\n\nIn the early hours of Saturday, 17 November 1973, Papadopoulos sent the army to suppress the student strike and sit-in of the \"Free Besieged\" (\u0395\u03bb\u03b5\u03cd\u03b8\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf\u03b9 \u03a0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf\u03c1\u03ba\u03b7\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9), as the students called themselves, at the Athens Polytechnic which had commenced on 14 November. Shortly after 3:00&nbsp;a.m. EET, under almost complete cover of darkness, an [[AMX 30]] tank crashed through the rail gate of the Athens Polytechnic with subsequent loss of life. The army also occupied [[Syntagma Square]] for at least the following day. Even the sidewalk cafes were closed.\n\nIoannidis' involvement in inciting unit commanders to commit criminal acts during the uprising, so that he could facilitate his own upcoming coup, was noted in the indictment presented to the court by the prosecutor during the [[Greek junta trials]], and in his subsequent conviction in the Polytechneion trial where he was found to have been morally responsible for the events.<ref name=\"Tsevas\">[http://www.vrahokipos.net/old/history/gr/polytexneio/Tsevas.htm Tsevas report] Quote: \"\u039f\u03b9 \u0399\u03c9\u03b1\u03bd\u03bd\u03af\u03b4\u03b7\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03a1\u03bf\u03c5\u03c6\u03bf\u03b3\u03ac\u03bb\u03b7\u03c2, \u03b4\u03b9\u03b1 \u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u03b5\u03b9\u03c2 \u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03bf\u03cd\u03c2 \u03c0\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03ce\u03bd \u0391\u03be\u03b9\u03c9\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ce\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c0\u03c1\u03b1\u03ba\u03c4\u03cc\u03c1\u03c9\u03bd, \u03b5\u03c0\u03b7\u03c1\u03b5\u03ac\u03b6\u03bf\u03c5\u03bd \u03c3\u03bf\u03b2\u03b1\u03c1\u03ce\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c3\u03b1\u03c6\u03ce\u03c2 \u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u03cc\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd \u03b5\u03c0\u03b9\u03c7\u03b5\u03af\u03c1\u03b7\u03c3\u03b9\u03bd, \u03b5\u03be\u03b1\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03cd\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2 \u03ba\u03cd\u03bc\u03b1 \u03b2\u03b9\u03b1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c4\u03ae\u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c0\u03c5\u03c1\u03bf\u03b2\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03c3\u03bc\u03ce\u03bd, \u03b5\u03c0\u03af \u03c4\u03c9 \u03c4\u03ad\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9 \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u03b4\u03b7\u03bc\u03b9\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03b3\u03af\u03b1\u03c2 \u03b5\u03c5\u03bd\u03bf\u03ca\u03ba\u03ce\u03bd \u03b4\u03b9\u03b1 \u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03b1\u03c0\u03bf\u03c6\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03c3\u03b8\u03b5\u03af\u03c3\u03b1\u03bd \u03ba\u03af\u03bd\u03b7\u03c3\u03b9\u03bd \u03c3\u03c5\u03bd\u03b8\u03b7\u03ba\u03ce\u03bd \u03b1\u03c3\u03c6\u03b1\u03bb\u03b5\u03af\u03b1\u03c2, \u03b1\u03bd\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03c7\u03ae\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c3\u03c5\u03b3\u03ba\u03c1\u03bf\u03cd\u03c3\u03b5\u03c9\u03bd.\"</ref><ref name=\"Unrepetant\">[https://archive.is/20130217215014/http://www.enet.gr/online/online_text/c=112,dt=23.07.2008,id=2496400,10059024,24232592 Eleftherotypia] Unrepentant for the Dictatorship.

A6.</ref>\n\nBrigadier [[Dimitrios Ioannidis]], a disgruntled junta hardliner and long-time prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Papadopoulos as head of the feared Military Police, used the uprising as a pretext to reestablish public order, and staged a counter-coup that overthrew Papadopoulos and [[Spyros Markezinis]] on 25 November. Military law was reinstated, and the new Junta appointed General [[Phaedon Gizikis]] as President and economist [[Adamantios Androutsopoulos]] as Prime Minister, although Ioannidis remained the behind-the-scenes strongman.\n\nIoannidis's heavy-handed and opportunistic intervention had the effect of destroying the myth that the junta was an [[Ideal (ethics)|idealistic]] group of army officers with exactly the same ideals who came to save Greece by using their collective wisdom. The main tenet of the junta ideology (and mythology) was gone and so was the collective. By default, he remained the only man at the top after toppling the other three principals of the junta. Characteristically, he cited ideological reasons for ousting the Papadopoulos faction, accusing them with straying from the principles of the Revolution, especially of being corrupt and misusing their privileges as army officers for financial gains.\n\nPapadopoulos and his junta always claimed that the 21 April 1967 \"revolution\" saved Greece from the old party system. Now Ioannidis was, in effect, claiming that his coup saved the revolution from the Papadopoulos faction. The dysfunction as well as the ideological fragmentation and fractionalisation of the junta was finally out in the open. Ioannidis, however, did not make these accusations personally as he always tried to avoid unnecessary publicity. The radio broadcasts, following the now familiar ''coup in progress'' scenario featuring martial music interspersed with military orders and curfew announcements, kept repeating that the army was taking back the reins of power in order to save the principles of the revolution and that the overthrow of the Papadopoulos-Markezinis government was supported by the army, navy and air force.<ref name=\"BBC: On this day\">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/november/25/newsid_2546000/2546297.stm BBC: On this day] quote:A military communiqu\u00e9 announced the overthrow of the government was supported by the army, navy and air force and said it was a \"continuation of the revolution of 1967\", when the Greek colonels, headed by Mr Papadopoulos, seized control.

The [[Communist Party of Greece]] (KKE) and its ancillary organizations were outlawed ([[s:\u039d\u03cc\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 509/1947|Law 509/1947]]), and many Communists either fled the country or faced persecution. The CIA and the Greek military began to work together closely, especially after Greece joined the North Atlantic Treaty Organization ([[NATO]]) in 1952. This included notable CIA officers [[Gust Avrakotos]] and [[Clair George]]. Avrakotos maintained a close relationship with the colonels who would figure in the later coup.<ref name=crile>Charlie Wilson's War, George Crile, 2003, Grove/Atlantic.</ref> \n\nIn 1952, IDEA issued a manifesto stating that a dictatorship was the only possible solution to Greece's problems, which the Greek scholar Christos Kassimeris called an \"astonishing\" statement since the Communists had been defeated in 1949, Greece was enjoying relative prosperity after living standards had collapsed in the 1940s, and Greek politics were stable.<ref>Kassimeris, Christos ''Greece and the American Embrace: Greek Foreign Policy Towards Turkey, the US and the Western Alliance'', London: I.B.Tauris, 2009 p.75</ref> Kassimeris argued that since Papadopoulos played a large role in writing the 1952 manifesto, that it was his \"personal ambition\" rather than an objective fear of the Greek Communists that was driving him forward because in no way could Greece be presented as being on the brink of a Communist take-over in 1952.<ref>Kassimeris, Christos ''Greece and the American Embrace: Greek Foreign Policy Towards Turkey, the US and the Western Alliance'', London: I.B.Tauris, 2009 p.75</ref>    \n\nGreece was a vital link in the NATO defense arc which extended from the eastern border of Iran to the northernmost point in [[Norway]]. Greece in particular was seen as being at risk, having experienced a communist insurgency. In particular, the newly founded [[Hellenic National Intelligence Service]] (EYP) and the [[Mountain Raiding Companies]] (LOK) maintained a very close liaison with their American counterparts. In addition to preparing for a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] invasion, they agreed to guard against a left-wing ''coup''.

In a bid to gain more control over the country's government than his limited constitutional powers allowed, the young and inexperienced King [[Constantine II of Greece|Constantine II]] clashed with liberal reformers. In July 1964, Papandreou announced his intention to fire those officers belonging to IDEA, whom the king did not want dismissed, claiming it was his royal prerogative to protect the IDEA officers, which in turn led to massive demonstrations in Athens, which had a republican favor.<ref>Kassimeris, Christos ''Greece and the American Embrace: Greek Foreign Policy Towards Turkey, the US and the Western Alliance'', London: I.B.Tauris, 2009 p.46</ref> The king dismissed Papandreou in 1965 and causing a [[constitutional crisis]] known as the \"Apostasia of 1965\".\n\nAfter making several attempts to form governments, relying on dissident Centre Union and conservative MPs, Constantine II appointed an interim government under [[Ioannis Paraskevopoulos]], and new elections were called for 28 May 1967. There were many indications that Papandreou's Centre Union would emerge as the largest party, but would not be able to form a single-party government and would be forced into an alliance with the [[United Democratic Left]], which was suspected by conservatives of being a proxy for the banned KKE.

One such politician, [[George Rallis]], proposed that, in case of such an \"anomaly\", the King should declare [[martial law]] as the monarchist constitution permitted him. According to Rallis, Constantine was receptive to the idea.<ref name=\"Rallis\">Alexis Papachelas, \"Everything George Rallis recounted to me\", ''To Vima'', 19 March 2006</ref>\n\nAccording to U.S. diplomat John Day, Washington also worried that Andreas Papandreou would have a very powerful role in the next government, because of his father's old age. According to Robert Keely and John Owens, American diplomats present in Athens at the time, Constantine asked U.S. Ambassador [[Phillips Talbot|William Phillips Talbot]] what the American attitude would be to an extra-parliamentary solution to the problem. To this the embassy responded negatively in principle \u2013 adding, however, that, \"U.S. reaction to such a move cannot be determined in advance but would depend on circumstances at the time.\" Constantine denies this.<ref name=\"RWFKing1\">TV documentary \"[http://www.rwf.gr/episode1-new.php?id=198 \u03a4\u0391 \u0394\u0399\u039a\u0391 \u039c\u0391\u03a3 60's \u2014 \u039c\u03ad\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 3\u03bf: \u03a7\u0391\u039c\u0395\u039d\u0397 \u0391\u039d\u039f\u0399\u039e\u0397] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080406222452/http://www.rwf.gr/episode1-new.php?id=198 |date=6 April 2008}}\" by Stelios Kouloglu</ref> According to Talbot, Constantine met the army generals, who promised him that they would not take any action before the coming elections. However, the proclamations of Andreas Papandreou made them nervous, and they resolved to re-examine their decision after seeing the results of the elections.<ref name=\"RWFKing1\"/>\n\nIn 1966, Constantine sent his envoy, Demetrios Bitsios, to [[Paris]] on a mission to persuade former prime minister [[Constantine Karamanlis]] to return to Greece and resume his prior role in politics. According to uncorroborated claims made by the former monarch, Karamanlis replied to Bitsios that he would return only if the King imposed martial law, as was his constitutional prerogative.<ref name=\"Konstantinos speaks\">Alexis Papachelas, \"Constantine Speaks\", ''To Vima'', 29 January 2006.</ref> According to ''[[New York Times]]'' correspondent [[Cyrus Leo Sulzberger II|Cyrus L.

At the same time, a large number of small mobile units were dispatched to arrest leading politicians, authority figures, and  ordinary citizens suspected of left-wing sympathies, according to lists prepared in advance. One of the first to be arrested was Lieutenant General [[Grigorios Spandidakis]], Commander-in-Chief of the [[Greek Army]]. The colonels persuaded Spandidakis to join them, having him activate a [[Operation Gladio#Greece|previously-drafted action plan]] to move the coup forward. Under the command of paratrooper Brigadier General Kostas Aslanides, the [[1st Raider/Paratrooper Brigade (Greece)|LOK]] took over the [[Minister for National Defence (Greece)|Greek Defence Ministry]] while Pattakos gained control of communication centers, the [[Hellenic Parliament|parliament]], the [[Presidential Mansion, Athens|royal palace]], and \u2013 according to detailed lists \u2013 arrested over 10,000 people.<ref name=\"Ganser\"/>\n\nBy the early morning hours, the whole of Greece was in the hands of the colonels. All leading politicians, including acting Prime Minister [[Panagiotis Kanellopoulos]], had been arrested and were held incommunicado by the conspirators. At 6:00&nbsp;a.m. [[Eastern European Time|EET]], Papadopoulos announced that eleven articles of the [[Greek constitution]] were suspended.<ref name=\"Ganser\"/> One of the consequences of these suspensions was that anyone could be arrested without warrant at any time and brought before a [[military court]] to be tried. [[Ioannis Ladas]], then the director of [[Greek Military Police|ESA]], recounted in a later interview that, \"Within twenty minutes every politician, every man, every anarchist who was listed could be rounded up ... It was a simple, diabolical plan\".<ref name=\"Ganser\"/>\n\nGeorgios Papandreou was arrested after a nighttime raid at his villa in [[Kastri, Attica]]. Andreas was arrested at around the same time, after seven soldiers armed with fixed [[bayonet]]s and a [[machine gun]] forcibly entered his home. Andreas Papandreou escaped to the roof of his house, but surrendered after one of the soldiers held a gun to the head of his then-fourteen-year-old son [[George Papandreou]]. There has been unconfirmed speculation that <ref name=\"Ganser\"/> [[Gust Avrakotos]], a high-ranking CIA officer in Greece who was close with the colonels, advised them to \"shoot the motherfucker because he's going to come back to haunt you\".<ref name=crile />\n\nU.S. critics of the coup included then-Senator [[Lee Metcalf]], who criticised the [[Lyndon B.

Vatican agents who handed over $ 4 million to Georgios Papadopoulos through an intricate network of banks, as they feared the election of [[Andreas Papandreou]], a leftist politician accused of having sympathies for [[communism]].<ref>Frattini, Eric. The Entity: Five Centuries of Secret Vatican Espionage, St. Martin's Press; 1st U.S. Ed edition, 2008, p. 303-304. {{ISBN|0-3123-7594-8}} </ref>\n\n===Role of the King===\n{{Main|Constantine II of Greece}}\n\nWhen the tanks came to the streets of Athens on 21 April, the legitimate National Radical Union government, of which Rallis was a member, asked King Constantine to immediately mobilise the state against the coup; he declined to do so, and swore in the dictators as the legitimate government of Greece.\n\nThe King, who had relented and decided to co-operate, claims to this day that he was isolated and did not know what else to do. He has since claimed that he was trying to gain time to organise a counter-coup and oust the Junta. He did organise such a counter-coup; however, the fact that the new government had a legal sanction, in that it had been appointed by the legitimate head of state, played an important role in the coup's success. The King was later to regret his decision bitterly. For many Greeks, it served to identify him indelibly with the coup and certainly played an important role in the final decision to abolish the monarchy, sanctioned by the 1974 referendum.\n\nThe only concession the King could achieve was to appoint a civilian as prime minister, rather than Spandidakis. [[Konstantinos Kollias]], a former Attorney General of the [[Court of Cassation (Greece)|Areios Pagos]] (supreme court), was chosen. He was a well-known royalist and had even been disciplined under the Papandreou government for meddling in the investigation of the murder of MP [[Gregoris Lambrakis]]. Kollias was little more than a figurehead and real power rested with the army, and especially Papadopoulos, who emerged as the coup's strong man and became Minister to the Presidency of the Government. Other coup members occupied key posts.\n\nUp until then constitutional legitimacy had been preserved, since under the Greek Constitution the King could appoint whomever he wanted as prime minister, as long as Parliament endorsed the appointment with a vote of confidence or a general election was called. It was this government, sworn-in during the early evening hours of 21 April, that formalised the coup. It adopted a \"Constituent Act\", an amendment tantamount to a revolution, cancelling the elections and effectively abolishing the constitution, which would be replaced later.\n\nIn the meantime, the government was to rule by decree. Since traditionally such Constituent Acts did not need to be signed by the Crown, the King never signed it, permitting him to claim, years later, that he had never signed any document instituting the junta. Critics claim that Constantine II did nothing to prevent the government (and especially his chosen prime minister, Kollias) from legally instituting the authoritarian government to come. This same government published and enforced a decree, already proclaimed on radio as the coup was in progress, instituting military law. Constantine claimed he never signed that decree either.\n\n===King's counter-coup===\nFrom the outset, the relationship between Constantine and the colonels was an uneasy one. The colonels were not willing to share power, whereas the young king, like his father before him, was used to playing an active role in politics and would never consent to being a mere figurehead, especially in a military administration. Although the colonels' strong anti-communist, pro-NATO, and pro-Western views appealed to the United States, [[President of the United States|President]] [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] \u2013 in an attempt to avoid an international backlash \u2013 told Constantine that it would be best to replace the junta with a new government according to Paul Ioannidis in his book ''Destiny Prevails: My life with Arist\u00f3teles Onassis''. Constantine took that as an encouragement to organize a counter-coup, although no direct help or involvement of the U.S. (or Britain)<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Nafpliotis|first1=Alexandros|title=\"A gift from God\": Anglo-Greek relations during the dictatorship of the Greek colonels|journal=The Historical Review/La Revue Historique|date=December 2014|volume=11|pages=77\u201378|doi=10.12681/hr.329|doi-access=free}}</ref> was forthcoming.\n\nThe King finally decided to launch his counter-coup on 13 December 1967. Since Athens was militarily in the hands of the colonels, Constantine decided to fly to the small northern city of [[Kavala]], where he hoped to be among troops loyal only to him. The vague plan that Constantine and his advisors had conceived was to form a unit that would invade and take control over [[Thessaloniki]], where an alternative administration would be installed. Constantine hoped that international recognition and internal pressure between the two governments would force the junta to resign, leaving the field clear for him to return triumphant to Athens.\n\nIn the early morning hours of 13 December, the King boarded the royal plane, together with [[Queen Anne-Marie of Greece|Queen Anne-Marie]], their two baby children [[Princess Alexia of Greece and Denmark|Princess Alexia]] and [[Pavlos, Crown Prince of Greece|Crown Prince Pavlos]], his mother [[Frederika of Hanover|Frederika]], and his sister, [[Princess Irene of Greece and Denmark|Princess Irene]]. Constantine also took with him Prime Minister Kollias. At first, things seemed to be going according to plan. Constantine was well received in Kavala, which was under the command of a general loyal to him. The [[Hellenic Air Force]] and [[Hellenic Navy|Navy]], both strongly royalist and not involved in the junta, immediately declared for him and mobilised. Another of Constantine's generals effectively cut all communication between Athens and northern Greece.\n\nHowever, Constantine's plans were overly bureaucratic, na\u00efvely supposing that orders from a commanding general would automatically be obeyed.\n\nIn the circumstances, middle-ranking pro-junta officers neutralised and arrested Constantine's royalist generals and took command of their units, and subsequently put together a force to advance on Kavala to arrest the King. The junta, not at all shaken by the loss of their figurehead premier, ridiculed Constantine by announcing that he was hiding \"from village to village\". Realising that the counter-coup had failed, Constantine fled Greece on board the royal plane, taking his family and the helpless Kollias with him. They landed in [[Rome]] early in the morning of 14 December. Constantine remained in exile all through the rest of military rule. Even though he would return to Greece, the country's abolition of the monarchy in 1973 stripped him of his status as King.\n\n===Regency===\nThe flight of Constantine and Kollias left Greece with no legal government or head of state. This did not concern the military junta. Instead the Revolutionary Council, composed of Pattakos, Papadopoulos, and Makarezos, appointed another member to the military administration, Major General [[Georgios Zoitakis]], as [[Regent of Greece|Regent]]. Zoitakis then appointed Papadopoulos as prime minister. This became the only government of Greece following the failure of the King's attempted counter-coup, as Constantine was unwilling to set up an alternative administration in exile. \n\nIn hopes of giving legal sanction to the regime, the junta drafted a [[Greek Constitution of 1968|new constitution]]. It made the military the guardians of \"social and political order,\" with wide autonomy from governmental and parliamentary oversight. It also heavily circumscribed the activities of political parties. The new constitution was approved in a [[Greek constitutional referendum, 1968|15 November referendum]], with over 92 percent approval. However, the referendum was conducted in less-than-free circumstances; the regime deployed extensive propaganda in favour of the new document while muzzling any opposition. Under the new constitution, the regency would continue until elections were held, unless the junta called Constantine back sooner (though Constantine never acknowledged, let alone recognised, the regency). However, the junta announced that the \"Revolution of April 21\" (as the regime called itself) would need time to reform the \"Greek mentality\" before holding elections. It also suspended most of the constitution's guarantees of civil rights until the restoration of civilian rule.\n\nIn a legally controversial move, even under the junta's own Constitution, the Cabinet voted on 21 March 1972 to oust Zoitakis and replace him with Papadopoulos, thus combining the offices of Regent and Prime Minister. It was thought Zoitakis was problematic and interfered too much with the military. The King's portrait remained on coins, in public buildings, etc., but slowly, the military chipped away at the institution of the monarchy: the royal family's tax immunity was abolished, the complex network of royal charities was brought under direct state control, the royal arms were removed from coins, the Navy and Air Force dropped their \"Royal\" names, and newspapers were prohibited from publishing the King's photo or any interviews.\n\nDuring this period, resistance against the colonels' rule became better organized among exiles in Europe and the United States. There was also considerable political infighting within the junta. Still, up until 1973, the junta appeared in firm control of Greece, and not likely to be ousted by violent means.\n\n==Characteristics of the Junta==\n\n===Ideology===\n[[File:Flag of Greece (1970-1975).svg|thumb|National flag adopted by the colonels (1970\u20131974). It was the old flag of the [[Hellenic Navy|Navy]], but featured a darker shade of blue.]]\n\nThe colonels preferred to call the coup a \"revolution to save the nation\" (''\"Ethnosotirios Epanastasis\"''). Their official justification was that a \"communist conspiracy\" had infiltrated Greece's bureaucracy, academia, press, and military, to such an extent that drastic action was needed to protect the country from communist takeover. Thus, the defining characteristic of the Junta was its staunch [[anti-communism]]. They used the term [[anarcho-communist]] (\u03b1\u03bd\u03b1\u03c1\u03c7\u03bf\u03ba\u03bf\u03bc\u03bc\u03bf\u03c5\u03bd\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03af ''anarchokommounistai'') to describe leftists in general. In a similar vein, the junta attempted to steer Greek public opinion not only by [[propaganda]] but also by inventing [[Glossary of the Greek military junta|new words]] and slogans, such as ''old-partyism'' (''palaiokommatismos'') to discredit [[parliamentary democracy]], or ''[[Glossary of the Greek military junta|Greece for Christian Greeks]]'' (''Ellas Ellinon Christianon'') to underscore its ideology.

This realisation, including the absence of any [[civil rights]] as well as maltreatment during police arrest, ranging from threats to beatings or worse, made life under the junta a difficult proposition for many ordinary citizens. Photography by ordinary citizens was banned in public locations.\n\nThe junta allowed citizens to participate in ordinary societal events that reflected those of the United States and United Kingdom, such as rock concerts for example. However, citizens lived in extreme fear, as any behavior that the junta disapproved of, coupled with the complete absence of any civil rights or freedoms, could easily result in torture, beatings, exile, imprisonment or worse, and the labeling of the victim as \u03b1\u03bd\u03b1\u03c1\u03c7\u03bf\u03ba\u03bf\u03bc\u03bc\u03bf\u03c5\u03bd\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03af, \"anarchocommunists\", or worse. The absence of a valid code of jurisprudence led to the unequal application of the law among the citizens and to rampant favouritism and [[nepotism]]. Absence of elected representation meant that the citizens' stark and only choice was to submit to these arbitrary measures exactly as dictated by the junta.

The son of a poor but educated rural family, he was educated at the prestigious [[Hellenic Military Academy]]. Papadopoulos allowed substantial social and cultural freedoms to all [[social class]]es, but political [[oppression]] and [[censorship]] were at times heavy-handed, especially in areas deemed sensitive by the junta, such as political activities, and politically related art, literature, film and music. [[Costa Gavras|Kostas Gavras's]] film ''[[Z (1969 film)|Z]]'' and [[Mikis Theodorakis]]'s music, among others, were never allowed even during the most relaxed times of the dictatorship, and an index of prohibited songs, literature and art was kept.\n\n====Western music and film====\nRemarkably, after some initial hesitation and as long as they were not deemed to be politically damaging to the junta, junta censors allowed wide access to Western music and films. Even the then-racy West German film ''[[Helga \u2013 Vom Werden des menschlichen Lebens|Helga]]'' ({{lang-de|Helga.

The regime sponsored song contests and concerts featuring folk musicians throughout its existence. The favored types of music employed by the government were those which accompanied the [[Kalamatianos]] and [[Tsamiko]] folk dances. Additionally, the regime encouraged the production of new folk songs with lyrics praising the government and its leaders, like Georgios Papadopoulos. Because the [[clarinet]] was so strongly featured in the music of the Junta, it remains associated with the Colonels by many Greeks today. The ideology behind the promotion of folk music was twofold: to bridge the gap of continuity with Greece's past and present, and to limit foreign cultural influences such as [[psychedelic music]] (which could hold political connotations contrary to those of the Junta) by substituting them with traditionally Greek ones. Folk music was also used as an ideological weapon against dissidents, and it was played constantly in detention centers to help break prisoners.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Papaeti |first1=Anna |last2= |first2= |date=January 2015 |title=Folk Music and the Cultural Policies of the Military Junta in Greece |url=https://soundscapesofdetention.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/2.2-m-logos-i0002-a0022-papaeti_with-corrections.pdf |journal=Mousikos Logos |volume= |issue=2 |pages= |issn=1108-6963 |access-date=15 October 2019 }}</ref>\n\n====Greek rock====\nIn the early days of the dictatorship, Western music broadcasts were limited from the airwaves in favour of [[martial music]], but this was eventually relaxed. In addition, [[pop music|pop]]/[[rock music]] programmes such as the one hosted by famous Greek music/radio/[[List of Greek language television channels#Greece|television]] personality and [[promoter (entertainment)|promoter]] [[Nico Mastorakis]] were very popular throughout the dictatorship years both on radio and television.<ref name=\"Nikos Mastorakis\">[http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/G/htmlG/greece/greece.htm \"Nikos Mastorakis\"].

[[tourism]] was actively encouraged by Papadopoulos' government and, funding scandals notwithstanding, there was  great development of the tourist sector. With tourism came nightlife. However, under Papadopoulos, in the absence of any civil rights these sociocultural freedoms existed in a legal vacuum that meant they were not guaranteed, but rather dispensed at the whim of the junta. In addition any transgressing into political matters during social or cultural activities usually meant arrest and punishment. Tourism was furthered by the [[1969 European Championships in Athletics]] in Athens which showed political normality. Even the boycott of the West German team was not directed against the junta, but against its own team leadership.<ref>[[Arnd Kr\u00fcger]]. \"A Cultural Revolution?

He cultivated this relationship by appealing to them, calling them \"the backbone of the people\" ({{lang-el|\u03b7 \u03c1\u03b1\u03c7\u03bf\u03ba\u03bf\u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u03b9\u03ac \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u03bb\u03b1\u03bf\u03cd}}) and cancelling all agricultural loans.<ref name=\"Google Book\">Michel Fors\u00e9.

Furthermore, the regime promoted a policy of economic development in rural areas, which were mostly neglected by the previous governments, that had focused largely on urban industrial development.\n\n====Urban classes====\nPapadopoulos was less likely to appeal to the largely civilian and city-oriented middle class, since he was a military man from a rural background. In addition, he had promised from the beginning that the dictatorship would not be permanent, and that when political order was established democratic rule would return.<ref name=\"The Metapolitefsi that never was\"/> On top of that, his promotion of tourism and other beneficial economic measures and the fact that, with the notable exceptions of political freedoms and press censorship, he did not otherwise substantially restrict the middle class, had the effect of assisting the junta in establishing its control over the country by gaining, at least initially, the reluctant acquiescence of some key segments of the population.\n\n===Economic policies===\nThe 1967\u20131973 period was marked by high rates of economic growth coupled with low inflation and low unemployment. Economic growth was driven by investment in the [[tourism industry]], loose emigration policies, public spending, and pro-business incentives that fostered both domestic and foreign capital spending. Several international companies invested in Greece at the time, including [[The Coca-Cola Company]]. Economic growth started losing steam by 1972.<ref name=\"The Metapolitefsi that never was\"/>\n\nIn addition, large scale construction of [[Hydroelectricity|hydroelectric dam]] projects, such as in [[Haliacmon|Aliakmon]], Kastrakion, Polyphytos, the expansion of [[thermoelectric]] generation units and other significant infrastructure development, took place. The junta used to proudly announce these projects with the slogan: \"Greece is a construction zone\" (\u0397 \u0395\u03bb\u03bb\u03ac\u03c2 \u03b5\u03af\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 \u03ad\u03bd\u03b1 \u03b5\u03c1\u03b3\u03bf\u03c4\u03ac\u03be\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd).

One such event is associated with the regime's tourism minister, [[Ioannis Ladas]] ({{lang-el|\u0399\u03c9\u03ac\u03bd\u03bd\u03b7\u03c2 \u039b\u03b1\u03b4\u03ac\u03c2}}). During his administration, several low-interest loans, amortized over a twenty-year period, were issued for tourist development. This fostered the erection of a multitude of hotels, sometimes in non-tourist areas, and with no underlying business rationale. Several such hotels were abandoned unfinished as soon as the loans were secured, and their remains still dot the Greek countryside. These questionable loans are referred to as ''Thalassodaneia'' ({{lang-el|\u03b8\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03c3\u03c3\u03bf\u03b4\u03ac\u03bd\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1}}), or \"loans of the sea\", to indicate the loose terms under which they were granted.<ref>[http://www.eleftherovima.gr/cgi-bin/news/viewnews.cgi?newsid1069362910,23284, Elefthero Vima] Quote: \"\u0391\u03bb\u03bb\u03ac, \u03b3\u03b9\u03b1 \u03bd\u03b1 \u03ad\u03c1\u03b8\u03b5\u03b9 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03b7 \u03c8\u03c5\u03c7\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u03ba\u03ac\u03b8\u03b1\u03c1\u03c3\u03b7 \u03bd\u03b1 \u03b2\u03b3\u03bf\u03c5\u03bd \u03c4\u03b1 \u03ba\u03b9\u03c4\u03ac\u03c0\u03b9\u03b1 \u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u03c4\u03c1\u03b1\u03c0\u03b5\u03b6\u03ce\u03bd \u03b3\u03b9\u03b1 \u03c4\u03b1 \u03b8\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03c3\u03c3\u03bf\u03b4\u03ac\u03bd\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1 \u03c0\u03bf\u03c5 \u03c0\u03ae\u03c1\u03b1\u03bd \u03b5\u03c0\u03af \u03c7\u03bf\u03cd\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03c2 \u03bf\u03b9 \u03b5\u03c5\u03c5\u03c0\u03cc\u03bb\u03b7\u03c0\u03c4\u03bf\u03b9 \u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03af\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03b1\u03b3\u03cc\u03c1\u03b1\u03c3\u03b1\u03bd \u03b3\u03b7 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03bf\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c0\u03b5\u03b4\u03b1 \u03b3\u03b9\u03b1 \u03bd\u03b1 \u03ba\u03c4\u03af\u03c3\u03bf\u03c5\u03bd.\" Translation: \"...&nbsp;for the loans of the sea which were received, during the junta years, by respected citizens and bought land and properties to build on\"</ref>\n\nAnother contested policy of the regime was the writing-off of agricultural loans, up to a value of 100,000 drachmas, to farmers.

In 1968 many militant groups promoting democratic rule were formed, both in exile and in Greece. These included, among others, [[Panhellenic Liberation Movement]], [[Democratic Defense]], the [[Socialist Democratic Union]], as well as groups from the entire left wing of the Greek political spectrum, including the [[Communist Party of Greece]] which had been outlawed even before the junta. The first armed action against the junta was the failed assassination attempt against [[Georgios Papadopoulos|George Papadopoulos]] by [[Alexandros Panagoulis]], on 13 August 1968.\n\n===Assassination attempt by Panagoulis===\nThe assassination attempt took place on the morning of 13 August, when Papadopoulos went from his summer residence in [[Lagonisi]] to [[Athens]], escorted by his personal security motorcycles and cars. Alexandros Panagoulis ignited a bomb at a point of the coastal road where the limousine carrying Papadopoulos would have to slow down, but the bomb failed to harm Papadopoulos. Panagoulis was captured a few hours later in a nearby sea cave, as the boat that would let him escape the scene of the attack had not shown up.\n\nPanagoulis was transferred to the [[Greek Military Police]] (EAT-ESA) offices, where he was questioned, beaten and tortured (see the proceedings of Theofiloyiannakos's trial). On 17 November 1968 he was sentenced to death, and remained in prison for five years. After the restoration of democracy, Panagoulis was elected a Member of Parliament. Panagoulis is regarded as an emblematic figure for the struggle to restore democracy.\n\n===Broadening of the movement===\nThe funeral of [[George Papandreou, Sr.]] on 3 November 1968 spontaneously turned into a massive demonstration against the junta. Thousands of Athenians disobeyed the military's orders and followed the casket to the cemetery. The government reacted by arresting 41 people.\n\nOn 28 March 1969, after two years of widespread censorship, political detentions and torture, [[Giorgos Seferis]], recipient of the [[Nobel Prize for Literature]] in 1963, took a stand against the junta. He made a statement on the [[BBC World Service]],<ref>John Karavidas, [https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=el&u=http://www.bbc.co.uk/greek/seferis.shtml&sa=X&oi=translate&resnum=1&ct=result&prev=/search%3Fq%3D%25CE%25A3%25CE%25B5%25CF%2586%25CE%25AD%25CF%2581%25CE%25B7%25CF%2582%2B%25CF%2587%25CE%25BF%25CF%258D%25CE%25BD%25CF%2584%25CE%25B1%2BBBC%26hl%3Den%26safe%3Doff%26rlz%3D1B3GGGL_enCA205CA242 George Seferis and the BBC], BBC Greek service, translation by Google.

Seferis did not live to see the end of the junta. His funeral, though, on 20 September 1972, turned into a massive demonstration against the military government.\n\nAlso in 1969, [[Costa-Gavras]] released the film [[Z (1969 film)|''Z'']], based on a book by celebrated left-wing writer [[Vassilis Vassilikos]]. The film, banned in Greece, presented a lightly fictionalized account of the events surrounding the assassination of [[United Democratic Left]] MP [[Gregoris Lambrakis]] in 1963. The film captured the sense of outrage about the junta. The soundtrack of the film was written by [[Mikis Theodorakis]], who was imprisoned by the junta and later went into exile, and the music was smuggled into the country to be added to the other inspirational, underground Theodorakis tracks.\n\nA lesser known [[Danish language|Danish]] film, in Greek, ''[[Your Neighbor's Son]]'', detailed the subordination and training of simple youths to become torturers for the junta.\n\n===International protest===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-F0503-0204-005, Stuttgart, Maikundgebung.jpg|thumb|Protest against the junta by Greek political exiles in Germany, 1967]]\n\nThe junta exiled thousands on the grounds that they were communists and/or \"enemies of the country\". Most of them were subjected to internal exile on Greek deserted islands, such as [[Makronisos]], [[Gyaros]], [[Gioura]], or inhabited islands such as [[Leros]], [[Agios Eustratios]] or [[Paleo Trikeri|Trikeri]]. \nThe most famous were in external exile, most of whom were substantially involved in the resistance, organising protests in European capital cities, or helping and hiding refugees from Greece.\n\nThese included: [[Melina Mercouri]], actor, singer (and, after 1981 [[Minister for Culture (Greece)|Minister for Culture]]); [[Mikis Theodorakis]], composer of resistance songs; [[Costas Simitis]] ([[Prime Minister of Greece|prime minister]] from 1996 to 2004); [[Andreas Papandreou]] (prime minister from 1981 to 1989 and again from 1993 to 1996); and Lady [[Amalia Fleming]] (wife of Sir [[Alexander Fleming]], philanthropist, political activist).<ref>{{cite book|last=Nafpliotis|first=Alexandros|title=Britain and the Greek Colonels: Accommodating the Junta in the Cold War|year=2012|publisher=I.B.

For example, Melina Mercouri was allowed to enter Greece, but stayed away on her own accord.\n\nIn the early hours of 19 September 1970 in Matteotti square in [[Genoa]], [[geology]] student [[Kostas Georgakis]] set himself ablaze in protest against the dictatorship of George Papadopoulos. The junta delayed the arrival of his remains to [[Corfu#Famous persons associated with Corfu|Corfu]] for four months, fearing public reaction and protests. At the time his death caused a sensation in Greece and abroad as it was the first tangible manifestation of the depth of resistance against the junta. He is the only known anti-junta resistance activist to have sacrificed himself and he is considered the precursor of later student protest, such as the [[Athens Polytechnic uprising]]. The Municipality of Corfu has dedicated a memorial in his honour near his home in [[Corfu (city)|Corfu city]].\n\nIn a speech before the U.S. Senate on 6 November 1971, Senator [[Lee Metcalf]] listed the members of the Greek junta who had served in the collaborationist [[Security Battalions]] and denounced the administration of [[Richard Nixon]] for supporting what he called a \"junta of Nazi collaborators\".<ref>Simpson, Christoper ''America's Recruitment of Nazis and Its Destructive Impact on Our Domestic and Foreign Policy'', London:  Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 1988 p.81-82.</ref> The German writer, [[Investigative journalism|investigative reporter]] and journalist [[G\u00fcnter Wallraff]] traveled to Greece in May 1974. While in [[Syntagma Square]], he protested against human right violations. He was arrested and tortured by the police, as he did not carry, on purpose, any papers on him that could identify him as a foreigner. After his identity was revealed, Wallraff was convicted and sentenced to 14 months in jail. He was released in August, after the end of the dictatorship.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guenter-wallraff.com/biographie.html |title=Biography of G\u00fcnther Wallraff |publisher=Guenter-wallraff.com |date=9 December 1969 |accessdate=18 April 2009}}</ref>\n\n===''Velos'' mutiny===\n[[File:Velos D16.jpg|thumb|250px|The destroyer ''Velos'' ({{lang-el|\u0392\u03ad\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2}}, \"Arrow\"), now a museum ship at [[Palaio Faliro]] in Athens]]\n\nIn an anti-[[military junta|junta]] protest, on 23 May 1973, [[USS Charrette (DD-581)|HNS ''Velos'']], under the command of Commander [[Nikolaos Pappas]], refused to return to Greece after participating in a [[NATO]] exercise and remained anchored at [[Fiumicino, Italy|Fiumicino]], [[Italy]]. During a patrol with other NATO vessels between continental Italy and [[Sardinia]], the commander and the officers heard over the radio that a number of fellow naval officers had been arrested in Greece. Commander Pappas was involved in a group of democratic officers who remained loyal to their oath to obey the Constitution and planned to act against the junta. [[Evangelos Averoff]] also participated in the ''Velos'' mutiny, for which he was later arrested as an \"instigator\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Nafpliotis|first=Alexandros|title=Britain and the Greek Colonels: Accommodating the Junta in the Cold War|year=2012|publisher=I.B.

He therefore decided to act alone in order to motivate global public opinion. He mustered all the crew to the stern and announced his decision, which was received with enthusiasm by the crew.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}\n\nPappas signaled his intentions to the squadron commander and NATO headquarters, quoting the preamble of the [[North Atlantic Treaty]], which declares that \"all governments ... are determined to safeguard the freedom, common heritage and civilisation of their peoples, founded on the principles of democracy, individual liberty and the rule of law\", and, leaving formation, sailed for Rome. There, anchored about {{convert|3.5|nmi|km|0}} away from the coast of Fiumicino, three ensigns sailed ashore with a whaleboat, went to [[Fiumicino Airport]] and telephoned the international press agencies, notifying them of the situation in Greece, the presence of the destroyer, and that the captain would hold a press conference the next day.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}\n\nThis action increased international interest in the situation in Greece.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Nafpliotis|first1=Alexandros|title=\"A gift from God\": Anglo-Greek relations during the dictatorship of the Greek colonels|journal=The Historical Review/La Revue Historique|date=December 2014|volume=11|pages=95\u201396|doi=10.12681/hr.329|doi-access=free}}</ref> The commander, six officers, and twenty five [[petty officer]]s requested permission to remain abroad as political refugees. Indeed, the whole crew wished to follow their commander but were advised by its officers to remain onboard and return to Greece to inform families and friends about what happened. ''Velos'' returned to Greece after a month with a replacement crew. After the fall of the junta all officers and petty officers returned to the Navy.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}\n\n==Collapse==\nThe collapse of the junta both ideologically and politically was triggered by a series of events which unfolded soon after Papadopoulos' attempt at liberalisation, with ideological collapse preceding its eventual political collapse. During and following this ill-fated process the internal political strains of the junta came to the fore and pitted the junta [[Political faction|factions]] against each other, thus destroying the seemingly monolithic cohesion of the dictatorship.\n\nThis had the effect of seriously weakening the coherence of the political message and, consequently, the credibility of the regime, a fatal blow from which, as later events would show, it never recovered. At the same time, during Papadopoulos' attempt at liberalisation, some of the junta constraints were removed from the [[body politic]] of Greece and that led to demands for more freedoms, and political unrest, in a society well used to democratic action prior to the dictatorship.\n\n===Normalization and attempts at liberalization===\n[[File:Presidential Standard of Greece (1973-1974).svg|thumb|right|220px|Presidential standard (1973\u201374)]]\n\nPapadopoulos had indicated as early as 1968 that he was eager for a reform process. He had declared at the time that he did not want the \"Revolution\" ([[Glossary of the Greek military junta|junta speak]] for the \"dictatorship\") to become a \"regime\". He then repeatedly attempted to initiate reforms in 1969 and 1970, only to be thwarted by the hardliners including Ioannidis. In fact subsequent to his 1970 failed attempt at reform, he threatened to resign and was dissuaded only after the hardliners renewed their personal allegiance to him.<ref name=\"The Metapolitefsi that never was\">Ioannis Tzortzis, {{cite web|url=http://www.lse.ac.uk/collections/hellenicObservatory/pdf/TheMetapolitefsiThatNeverWas.pdf |title=The Metapolitefsi that never was |accessdate=2007-06-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070710022854/http://www.lse.ac.uk/collections/hellenicObservatory/pdf/TheMetapolitefsiThatNeverWas.pdf |archivedate=10 July 2007 |df=dmy }} Quote: \"The Americans asked the Greek government to allow the use of their bases in Greek territory and air space to supply [[Israel]]; Markezinis, backed by Papadopoulos, denied on the grounds of maintaining good relations with the Arab countries.

Quote:\"The first attempt of Papadopoulos to start a process of reform occurred in the spring of 1968. He was claiming that if the 'Revolution' stayed more than a certain time in power, it would lose its dynamics and transform into a 'regime', which was not in his intentions. He tried to implicate Markezinis in the attempt; however, he met the stiff resistance of the hard-liners. Another attempt was again frustrated in the end of 1969 and the beginning of 1970; Papadopoulos was then disappointed and complaining \u2018I am being subverted by my fellow Evelpides cadets!\u2019 As a result of this second failure, he considered resigning in the summer of 1970, complaining that he lacked any support from other leading figures, his own closest followers included. But the rest of the faction leaders renewed their trust to him.\" Quote: \"The 1973 oil crisis finally dealt a real financial shock to the Greek economy, as it did to all non-oil producing countries,

(regime supporters), it was bicameral, composed of the Central Advisory Council and the Provincial Advisory Council. The Central Council met in Athens in the Parliament Building. Both councils had the purpose to advise the dictator. At the time of the announcement of the formation of the council, Papadopoulos explained that he wanted to avoid using the term \"Vouli\" (Parliament) for the Committee because it sounded bad.<ref name=\"Eleftherotypia\"/>\n\nThe council was dissolved just prior to Papadopoulos' failed attempt to liberalise his regime. As internal dissatisfaction grew in the early 1970s, and especially after an abortive coup by the [[Hellenic Navy|Navy]] in early 1973,<ref name=\"The Metapolitefsi that never was\"/> Papadopoulos attempted to legitimize the regime by beginning a gradual \"democratization\" (See also the article on [[Metapolitefsi#Prologue|Metapolitefsi]]).\n\nOn 1 June 1973, he abolished the monarchy and declared Greece a republic with himself as president. He was confirmed in office after [[Greek republic referendum, 1973|a controversial referendum]], the results of which were not recognised by the political parties. He furthermore sought the support of the old political establishment, but secured only the cooperation of [[Spiros Markezinis]], who was appointed Prime Minister. Concurrently, many restrictions were lifted, and the army's role significantly reduced. Papadopoulos intended to establish a [[presidential republic]], with extensive\u2013and within the context of the system, almost dictatorial\u2013powers vested in the office of President, which he held. The decision to return to political rule and the restriction of their role was resented by many of the regime's supporters in the [[Hellenic Army|Army]], whose dissatisfaction with Papadopoulos would become evident a few months later.\n\n===Uprising at the Polytechnic===\n{{Main|Athens Polytechnic uprising}}\n\nPapadopoulos' heavy-handed attempt at liberalisation did not find favour among many in Greece. The stilted democratisation process he proposed was constrained by multiple factors. His inexperience at carrying out an unprecedented political experiment of democratisation was burdened by his tendency to concentrate as much power in his hands as possible, a weakness he exhibited during the junta years when he would sometimes hold multiple high-echelon government portfolios. This especially antagonised the [[intelligentsia]], whose primary exponents were the students. The students at the Law School in Athens, for example, demonstrated multiple times against the dictatorship prior to the events at the Polytechneion.\n\nThe tradition of [[student protest]] was always strong in Greece, even before the dictatorship. Papadopoulos tried hard to suppress and discredit the student movement during his tenure at the helm of the junta. But the liberalisation process he undertook allowed the students to organise more freely, and this gave the opportunity to the students at the [[National Technical University of Athens]] to organise a demonstration that grew progressively larger and more effective. The political momentum was on the side of the students. Sensing this, the junta panicked and reacted violently.<ref>Kostis Kornetis (2013). Children of the Dictatorship. Student Resistance, Cultural Politics and the \"Long 1960s\" in Greece. New York : Berghahn Books.</ref>\n\nIn the early hours of Saturday, 17 November 1973, Papadopoulos sent the army to suppress the student strike and sit-in of the \"Free Besieged\" (\u0395\u03bb\u03b5\u03cd\u03b8\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf\u03b9 \u03a0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf\u03c1\u03ba\u03b7\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9), as the students called themselves, at the Athens Polytechnic which had commenced on 14 November. Shortly after 3:00&nbsp;a.m. EET, under almost complete cover of darkness, an [[AMX 30]] tank crashed through the rail gate of the Athens Polytechnic with subsequent loss of life. The army also occupied [[Syntagma Square]] for at least the following day. Even the sidewalk cafes were closed.\n\nIoannidis' involvement in inciting unit commanders to commit criminal acts during the uprising, so that he could facilitate his own upcoming coup, was noted in the indictment presented to the court by the prosecutor during the [[Greek junta trials]], and in his subsequent conviction in the Polytechneion trial where he was found to have been morally responsible for the events.<ref name=\"Tsevas\">[http://www.vrahokipos.net/old/history/gr/polytexneio/Tsevas.htm Tsevas report] Quote: \"\u039f\u03b9 \u0399\u03c9\u03b1\u03bd\u03bd\u03af\u03b4\u03b7\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03a1\u03bf\u03c5\u03c6\u03bf\u03b3\u03ac\u03bb\u03b7\u03c2, \u03b4\u03b9\u03b1 \u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u03b5\u03b9\u03c2 \u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03bf\u03cd\u03c2 \u03c0\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03ce\u03bd \u0391\u03be\u03b9\u03c9\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ce\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c0\u03c1\u03b1\u03ba\u03c4\u03cc\u03c1\u03c9\u03bd, \u03b5\u03c0\u03b7\u03c1\u03b5\u03ac\u03b6\u03bf\u03c5\u03bd \u03c3\u03bf\u03b2\u03b1\u03c1\u03ce\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c3\u03b1\u03c6\u03ce\u03c2 \u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u03cc\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd \u03b5\u03c0\u03b9\u03c7\u03b5\u03af\u03c1\u03b7\u03c3\u03b9\u03bd, \u03b5\u03be\u03b1\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03cd\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2 \u03ba\u03cd\u03bc\u03b1 \u03b2\u03b9\u03b1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c4\u03ae\u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c0\u03c5\u03c1\u03bf\u03b2\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03c3\u03bc\u03ce\u03bd, \u03b5\u03c0\u03af \u03c4\u03c9 \u03c4\u03ad\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9 \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u03b4\u03b7\u03bc\u03b9\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03b3\u03af\u03b1\u03c2 \u03b5\u03c5\u03bd\u03bf\u03ca\u03ba\u03ce\u03bd \u03b4\u03b9\u03b1 \u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03b1\u03c0\u03bf\u03c6\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03c3\u03b8\u03b5\u03af\u03c3\u03b1\u03bd \u03ba\u03af\u03bd\u03b7\u03c3\u03b9\u03bd \u03c3\u03c5\u03bd\u03b8\u03b7\u03ba\u03ce\u03bd \u03b1\u03c3\u03c6\u03b1\u03bb\u03b5\u03af\u03b1\u03c2, \u03b1\u03bd\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03c7\u03ae\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c3\u03c5\u03b3\u03ba\u03c1\u03bf\u03cd\u03c3\u03b5\u03c9\u03bd.\"</ref><ref name=\"Unrepetant\">[https://archive.is/20130217215014/http://www.enet.gr/online/online_text/c=112,dt=23.07.2008,id=2496400,10059024,24232592 Eleftherotypia] Unrepentant for the Dictatorship.

A6.</ref>\n\nBrigadier [[Dimitrios Ioannidis]], a disgruntled junta hardliner and long-time prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Papadopoulos as head of the feared Military Police, used the uprising as a pretext to reestablish public order, and staged a counter-coup that overthrew Papadopoulos and [[Spyros Markezinis]] on 25 November. Military law was reinstated, and the new Junta appointed General [[Phaedon Gizikis]] as President and economist [[Adamantios Androutsopoulos]] as Prime Minister, although Ioannidis remained the behind-the-scenes strongman.\n\nIoannidis's heavy-handed and opportunistic intervention had the effect of destroying the myth that the junta was an [[Ideal (ethics)|idealistic]] group of army officers with exactly the same ideals who came to save Greece by using their collective wisdom. The main tenet of the junta ideology (and mythology) was gone and so was the collective. By default, he remained the only man at the top after toppling the other three principals of the junta. Characteristically, he cited ideological reasons for ousting the Papadopoulos faction, accusing them with straying from the principles of the Revolution, especially of being corrupt and misusing their privileges as army officers for financial gains.\n\nPapadopoulos and his junta always claimed that the 21 April 1967 \"revolution\" saved Greece from the old party system. Now Ioannidis was, in effect, claiming that his coup saved the revolution from the Papadopoulos faction. The dysfunction as well as the ideological fragmentation and fractionalisation of the junta was finally out in the open. Ioannidis, however, did not make these accusations personally as he always tried to avoid unnecessary publicity. The radio broadcasts, following the now familiar ''coup in progress'' scenario featuring martial music interspersed with military orders and curfew announcements, kept repeating that the army was taking back the reins of power in order to save the principles of the revolution and that the overthrow of the Papadopoulos-Markezinis government was supported by the army, navy and air force.<ref name=\"BBC: On this day\">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/november/25/newsid_2546000/2546297.stm BBC: On this day] quote:A military communiqu\u00e9 announced the overthrow of the government was supported by the army, navy and air force and said it was a \"continuation of the revolution of 1967\", when the Greek colonels, headed by Mr Papadopoulos, seized control.

For this reason, it may be as helpful to consider the differences between descriptions of open educational resources as it is to consider the descriptions themselves. One of several tensions in reaching a consensus description of OER (as found in the above definitions) is whether there should be explicit emphasis placed on specific [[technology|technologies]]. For example, a [[video]] can be openly licensed and freely used without being a ''streaming'' video. A [[book]] can be openly licensed and freely used without being an ''electronic'' document. This technologically driven tension is deeply bound up with the discourse of [[Open-source license|open-source licensing]].

For example, Weller (2013) defines open pedagogy as follows: \"Open pedagogy makes use of this abundant, open content (such as open educational resources, videos, podcasts), but also places an emphasis on the network and the learner's connections within this\".<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.5334/2013-15|title = The Battle for Open - a perspective|journal = Journal of Interactive Media in Education|volume = 2013|issue = 3|pages = 15|year = 2013|last1 = Weller|first1 = Martin|doi-access = free}}</ref> Open educational practices are defined as, for example, \u201ca set of activities around instructional design and implementation of events and processes intended to support learning. They also include the creation, use and repurposing of Open Educational Resources (OER) and their adaptation to the contextual setting. (The Open Educational Quality Initiative<ref>https://duepublico.uni-duisburg-essen.de/servlets/DerivateServlet/Derivate-25907/OPALReport2011_Beyond_OER.pdf</ref>). Wiley & Hilton (2018)<ref name=\"irrodl.org\"/> proposed a new term called \"OER-enabled pedagogy\", which is defined as \"the set of teaching and learning practices that are only possible or practical in the context of the 5R permissions which are characteristic of OER\", emphasizing the 5R permissions enabled by the use of open licenses.\n\n== Costs ==\nOne of the most frequently cited benefits of OER is their potential to reduce costs.<ref>Bliss, T.

Retrieved from http://www.irrodl.org/index.php/irrodl/article/view/1153</ref> While OER seem well placed to bring down total expenditures, they are not cost-free. New OER can be assembled or simply reused or repurposed from existing open resources. This is a primary strength of OER and, as such, can produce major cost savings. OER need not be created from scratch. On the other hand, there are some costs in the assembly and adaptation process. And some OER must be created and produced originally at some time. While OER must be hosted and disseminated, and some require funding, OER development can take different routes, such as creation, adoption, adaptation and curation.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nEach of these models provides different cost structure and degree of cost-efficiency. Upfront costs in developing the OER infrastructure can be expensive, such as building the OER infrastructure. Butcher and Hoosen<ref>Butcher, N., & Hoosen, S. (2012).

Retrieved from http://www.col.org/resources/publications/Pages/detail.aspx?PID=421</ref> noted that \u201ca key argument put forward by those who have written about the potential benefits of OER relates to its potential for saving cost or, at least, creating significant economic efficiencies. However, to date there has been limited presentation of concrete data to back up this assertion, which reduces the effectiveness of such arguments and opens the OER movement to justified academic criticism.\u201d<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Institutional support==\nA large part of the early work on open educational resources was funded by universities and foundations such as the [[William and Flora Hewlett Foundation]],<ref name=\"guttenplan\" /> which was the main financial supporter of open educational resources in the early years and has spent more than $110 million in the 2002 to 2010 period, of which more than $14 million went to [[MIT OpenCourseWare|MIT]].<ref name=\"hafner\" /> The [[Shuttleworth Foundation]], which focuses on projects concerning collaborative content creation, has contributed as well.

For this reason, it may be as helpful to consider the differences between descriptions of open educational resources as it is to consider the descriptions themselves. One of several tensions in reaching a consensus description of OER (as found in the above definitions) is whether there should be explicit emphasis placed on specific [[technology|technologies]]. For example, a [[video]] can be openly licensed and freely used without being a ''streaming'' video. A [[book]] can be openly licensed and freely used without being an ''electronic'' document. This technologically driven tension is deeply bound up with the discourse of [[Open-source license|open-source licensing]].

For example, Weller (2013) defines open pedagogy as follows: \"Open pedagogy makes use of this abundant, open content (such as open educational resources, videos, podcasts), but also places an emphasis on the network and the learner's connections within this\".<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.5334/2013-15|title = The Battle for Open - a perspective|journal = Journal of Interactive Media in Education|volume = 2013|issue = 3|pages = 15|year = 2013|last1 = Weller|first1 = Martin|doi-access = free}}</ref> Open educational practices are defined as, for example, \u201ca set of activities around instructional design and implementation of events and processes intended to support learning. They also include the creation, use and repurposing of Open Educational Resources (OER) and their adaptation to the contextual setting. (The Open Educational Quality Initiative<ref>https://duepublico.uni-duisburg-essen.de/servlets/DerivateServlet/Derivate-25907/OPALReport2011_Beyond_OER.pdf</ref>). Wiley & Hilton (2018)<ref name=\"irrodl.org\"/> proposed a new term called \"OER-enabled pedagogy\", which is defined as \"the set of teaching and learning practices that are only possible or practical in the context of the 5R permissions which are characteristic of OER\", emphasizing the 5R permissions enabled by the use of open licenses.\n\n== Costs ==\nOne of the most frequently cited benefits of OER is their potential to reduce costs.<ref>Bliss, T.

Retrieved from http://www.irrodl.org/index.php/irrodl/article/view/1153</ref> While OER seem well placed to bring down total expenditures, they are not cost-free. New OER can be assembled or simply reused or repurposed from existing open resources. This is a primary strength of OER and, as such, can produce major cost savings. OER need not be created from scratch. On the other hand, there are some costs in the assembly and adaptation process. And some OER must be created and produced originally at some time. While OER must be hosted and disseminated, and some require funding, OER development can take different routes, such as creation, adoption, adaptation and curation.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nEach of these models provides different cost structure and degree of cost-efficiency. Upfront costs in developing the OER infrastructure can be expensive, such as building the OER infrastructure. Butcher and Hoosen<ref>Butcher, N., & Hoosen, S. (2012).

Retrieved from http://www.col.org/resources/publications/Pages/detail.aspx?PID=421</ref> noted that \u201ca key argument put forward by those who have written about the potential benefits of OER relates to its potential for saving cost or, at least, creating significant economic efficiencies. However, to date there has been limited presentation of concrete data to back up this assertion, which reduces the effectiveness of such arguments and opens the OER movement to justified academic criticism.\u201d<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Institutional support==\nA large part of the early work on open educational resources was funded by universities and foundations such as the [[William and Flora Hewlett Foundation]],<ref name=\"guttenplan\" /> which was the main financial supporter of open educational resources in the early years and has spent more than $110 million in the 2002 to 2010 period, of which more than $14 million went to [[MIT OpenCourseWare|MIT]].<ref name=\"hafner\" /> The [[Shuttleworth Foundation]], which focuses on projects concerning collaborative content creation, has contributed as well.

In [[1994 Ladies European Tour|1994]] Neumann topped the LET Order of Merit, was voted ''[[Golf World]]'''s Most Improved Golfer and awarded [[Swedish Golfer of the Year]] for the third time.\n\nNeumann played in the European [[Solheim Cup]] team against United States, six times in a row, [[1990 Solheim Cup|1990]], [[1992 Solheim Cup|1992]], [[1994 Solheim Cup|1994]], [[1996 Solheim Cup|1996]], [[1998 Solheim Cup|1998]], and [[2000 Solheim Cup|2000]]. She captained the team to victory in August, [[2013 Solheim Cup|2013]] at [[Colorado Golf Club]] in [[Parker, Colorado]], the first time team Europe won the cup on foreign soil, and the first time Europe won consecutive cups. Neumann won the [[Women's World Cup of Golf]] for Sweden in 2006 with [[Annika S\u00f6renstam]].\n\nShe was recognized during the LPGA\u2019s 50th Anniversary in 2000 as one of the LPGA\u2019s top 50 players and teachers.\n\nOn June 7, 2006, the Ladies European Tour announced that Neumann has earned Lifetime Membership of the LET, at the time a feat achieved by six other golfers, [[Helen Alfredsson]], [[Laura Davies]], [[Marie-Laure de Lorenzi]], [[Alison Nicholas]], [[Dale Reid]] and [[Annika S\u00f6renstam|Annika Sorenstam]].\n\n==Amateur wins==\n*1981 Swedish International

She bettered her personal 72-hole best with 30 strokes and beat the whole Swedish amateur national team, of which some did not even had heard of Neumann before the tournament.

She won five times in [[Japan]] and the 1995 [[Holden Women's Australian Open|Women's Australian Open]]. Her victory in the 1994 [[Women's British Open|Women\u2019s British Open]] made her the fifth player to win both British and U.S. Open titles, joining [[Laura Davies]], [[Jane Geddes]], [[Betsy King]] and [[Patty Sheehan]]. This accomplishment was later also achieved by [[Alison Nicholas]], [[Pak Se-ri]], [[Karrie Webb]], [[Inbee Park]] and [[Ariya Jutanugarn]].

During the [[Middle Ages]], Norrbotten/Lappland was considered a [[no man's land]]. The area was in fact populated by [[nomadic]] [[Sami people]], but the region became increasingly settled by Swedish, Finnish and Norwegian settlers - especially along the coasts and large rivers. From the Middle Ages on, the Swedish kings tried to colonise and Christianise the area using settlers from what is now Finland and southern Sweden. Today, despite large-scale assimilation into the dominant Swedish culture, Finnish and Sami minorities continue to maintain their cultures and identities.\n\nDespite independent cultural presence, religious beliefs were subject to conversion in the 17th and 18th centuries resulting in Lapplanders generally leaving their original [[shamanism]] and converting to [[Religion in Sweden#Protestant Reformation|Lutheranism]]. Since the 19th century, Lappland has been particularly characterised by [[Laestadianism|Laestadian Lutheranism]].\n\nDuring the [[industrialization of Sweden]] in the late-19th century, natural resources (hydroelectricity, timber and minerals) from Lappland and surrounding provinces played a key role. Still, mining, forestry and hydroelectric power are the backbone of the local economy, together with municipal services. The unemployment has however been relatively high for several decades and many young people leave for the larger cities by the coast or in southern Sweden.\n\n==Geography==\nLocated in Sweden, Lapland is known for containing the [[Vindelfj\u00e4llen Nature Reserve]], one of the largest nature reserves in Sweden. Other parts of Lappland have been named a [[UNESCO]] [[World heritage site]], the [[Laponian area]], and the province contains some of the oldest and most spectacular [[national park]]s of northern Europe, e.g. [[Sarek National Park]], established in 1909. Lappland has an area of 109,702 square km (c. 42,300 sq miles), larger than [[Austria]] and almost equal to [[Portugal]].\n\n===National parks===\n*[[Abisko]]\n*[[Bj\u00f6rnlandet]]\n*[[Muddus]]\n*[[Padjelanta]]\n*[[Sarek National Park|Sarek]]\n*[[Stora Sj\u00f6fallet]]\n*[[Vadvetj\u00e5kka]]\n\n==Administration==\nThe traditional [[provinces of Sweden]] serve no administrative or political purposes but are cultural and historical entities. Administratively, Lappland constitutes the western part of two [[counties of Sweden]], [[Norrbotten County]] in the north and [[V\u00e4sterbotten County]] in the south. In contrast to most other areas of Sweden, there is more of an identification with the ''counties'' rather than to ''provinces''. Thus, most people in these counties refer to the entire county, including the areas in Lappland, when they say 'Norrbotten' or 'V\u00e4sterbotten'.\n\nCitizens of [[Sami people|Sami]] descent are eligible to stand and vote in elections for the Swedish [[Sami Parliament of Sweden|Sami Parliament]], which is the case with Sami people elsewhere in Sweden as well. The [[Sami language]] has an official minority status in [[Kiruna Municipality]], [[G\u00e4llivare Municipality]], [[Jokkmokk Municipality]] and [[Arjeplog Municipality]].\n\nThe following municipalities have their seats in Lapland:\n\n* [[Arjeplog Municipality|Arjeplog]]\n* [[Arvidsjaur Municipality|Arvidsjaur]]\n* [[Dorotea Municipality|Dorotea]]\n* [[G\u00e4llivare Municipality|G\u00e4llivare]]\n* [[Jokkmokk Municipality|Jokkmokk]]\n* [[Kiruna Municipality|Kiruna]]\n* [[Lycksele Municipality|Lycksele]]\n* [[Mal\u00e5 Municipality|Mal\u00e5]]\n* [[Sorsele Municipality|Sorsele]]\n* [[Storuman Municipality|Storuman]]\n* [[Vilhelmina Municipality|Vilhelmina]]\n* [[\u00c5sele Municipality|\u00c5sele]]\n\n==Population==\nAs of 31 December 2017, the population of Swedish Lappland is 91,333.<ref name=\"population\"/> Together with the rest of historical Lapland, the sum of the population is approximately 250,000.<ref>Finnish municipalities counted: Enonteki\u00f6, Inari, Utsjoki, Muonio, Kittil\u00e4 and Sodankyl\u00e4.

Blazon Swedish version: \"Argent, a Wildman statant Gules wrapped with birch leaves Vert on the head and around the waist holding a Club Or in dexter over the shoulder.\" The wildman used to be depicted with more features, impressively drawn muscles and a dour expression on his face.\n\nThe [[Wild man|wildman]] wielding a club as heraldic symbol of Lappland first appeared at the coronation of [[Charles IX of Sweden]] in 1607, then at the same king's burial in 1611. The colour red of his skin was decided only in 1949; before then various colours had been used (natural skin colour in the first half of the 20th century). The wildman, though unusual in heraldry, is an old symbol of the uncivilised north and appeared in books and woodcuts of the 16th century.\n\n==Climate==\nLappland has a [[subarctic climate]] in its lower areas, whereas a [[polar climate|polar]] variety can be found in [[Tarfala research station|Tarfala]], where the average high for the warmest month of the year (July) is lower than {{convert|10|C|F}} in mean temperatures. The southern parts of the province are significantly milder than the northern, due to the vast geographical differences. However, since Lappland is all made up of inland areas, maritime moderation is less significant than in the counties' coastal areas and in neighbouring [[Norway]], resulting in harsh winters. Southern areas at a lower elevation such as [[Lycksele]] also have relatively warm summers. Due to the [[arctic circle]], the northern areas of the province experience [[midnight sun]] and a moderate [[polar night]] with some civil twilight during opposite sides of the year.\n\n== Culture ==\n{{expand section|date=January 2015}}\nThe culture of the [[Sami people]], and the conservative Lutheran [[Laestadianism|Laestadian movement]] is prominent in the region.\n\n==Sports==\nFootball in the province is administered by [[Norrbottens Fotbollf\u00f6rbund]] and [[V\u00e4sterbottens Fotbollf\u00f6rbund]].\n\n==Marketing==\nAn EU-subsidised government tourism marketing organisation aiming to promote tourism in Northern Sweden has taken the brand name \"Swedish Lapland\". This name also covers towns in the coastal area of Gulf of Bothnia as well as the border area to Finland though neither areas are a part of the geographical province Swedish Lapland, rather the Lapland area as a whole in northern Scandinavia.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Laponia (historical province)|Laponia]] (the province prior to 1809, including the present-day Finnish part)\n*[[Lappmarken]]\n*[[National parks in Lapland]]\n*[[Lapland (Finland)|Finnish Lapland]]\n*[[S\u00e1pmi]] (the larger traditional territory of the [[Sami people|S\u00e1mi]], often called \"Lapland\" or \"Lappland\" in English)\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.swedishlapland.co.uk Swedish Lapland] Swedish Lapland, Sweden's northernmost destination\n*[http://lapland.arvidsjaur.eu Arvidsjaur.eu] - Arvidsjaur, In heart of Swedish Lapland\n*[http://viaterra.net/photopages/1990-2000/sweden-north.htm viaterra.net] - Photos from the North of Sweden (Abisko, Lapporten, Tornetr\u00e4sk)\n\n{{Provinces of Sweden}}\n{{Coord|65.929|N|16.743|E|source:svwiki_region:SE|format=dms|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:Provinces of Sweden]]\n[[Category:Lapland (Sweden)| ]]\n", "text_old": "{{For|the province in Finland|Lapland (Finland)}}\n{{More citations needed|date=July 2019}}\n{{Infobox settlement\n<!-- See Template:Infobox settlement for additional fields and descriptions -->          \n| name          = Lappland\n| image_caption     = \n| image_shield      = Lappland vapen.svg\n| shield_size      = 100px\n| motto         = \n| image_map       = Sverigekarta-Landskap Lappland.svg\n| mapsize        = 250px\n| map_alt        = \n| map_caption      = \n| image         =\n| image_size       = 290px\n| coor_pinpoint     = \n| coordinates_footnotes = \n| subdivision_type    = Country\n| subdivision_name    = [[Sweden]]\n| subdivision_type1   = [[Lands of Sweden|Land]]\n| subdivision_type2   = Counties\n| subdivision_name1   = [[Norrland]]\n| subdivision_name2   = [[V\u00e4sterbotten County]]<br>[[Norrbotten County]]<br>[[J\u00e4mtland County]]\n| unit_pref       = Metric<!-- or US or UK -->\n| area_footnotes     = \n| area_total_km2     = 109,702\n| area_land_km2     = \n| area_water_km2     = \n| area_water_percent   = \n| area_note       = \n| population_total    = 91,333\n| population_as_of    = 2017\n| population_footnotes  = <ref name=\"population\">[https://www.scb.se/hitta-statistik/statistik-efter-amne/befolkning/befolkningens-sammansattning/befolkningsstatistik/pong/tabell-och-diagram/helarsstatistik--forsamling-landskap-och-stad/folkmangd-i-landskapen-den-31-december-2017/ Statistics Sweden] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180805075318/https://www.scb.se/hitta-statistik/statistik-efter-amne/befolkning/befolkningens-sammansattning/befolkningsstatistik/pong/tabell-och-diagram/helarsstatistik--forsamling-landskap-och-stad/folkmangd-i-landskapen-den-31-december-2017/ |date=2018-08-05 }}</ref>\n| population_density_km2 = auto\n| population_demonym   = \n| population_note    = \n| demographics_type1   = Ethnicity\n| demographics1_title1  = Language\n| demographics_type2   = Culture\n| timezone1       = [[Central European Time|CET]]\n| utc_offset1      = +1\n| timezone1_DST     = [[Central European Summer Time|CEST]]\n| utc_offset1_DST    = +2\n| postal_code_type    = [[List of postal codes in Sweden|Postal codes]]\n| postal_code      = \n| area_code       = \n| area_code_type     = [[Telephone numbers in Sweden|Area codes]]\n| coordinates      = \n| demographics1_info1  = [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Sami languages|Sami]]\n| demographics1_info2  = \n| demographics2_title2  = Flower\n| demographics2_info2  = [[Dryas octopetala|Mountain avens]]\n| demographics2_title3  = Animal\n| demographics2_info3  = [[Arctic fox]], [[Lynx]], [[Reindeer]]\n| demographics2_title4  = Bird\n| demographics2_info4  = [[Bluethroat]]\n| demographics2_title5  = Fish\n| demographics2_info5  = [[Salvelinus]]\n}}\n\n[[Image:Lapporten winter.jpg|thumb|255px|<center>[[Lapporten|The Lapporten mountain pass]]</center>]]\n[[Image:Abiskoj\u00e5kka and Tornetr\u00e4sk spring.jpg|thumb|255px|<center>[[Abiskoj\u00e5kka]] river and [[Tornetr\u00e4sk]] lake</center>]]\n\n'''Lappland''', often [[anglicised]] as '''Lapland''' ({{Lang-sv|Lappland}}'','' [[Northern Sami]]: ''S\u00e1pmi,'' [[Finnish language|Finnish]]: ''Lappi,'' [[Latin]]: ''Lapponia''), is a [[Provinces of Sweden|province]] in northernmost [[Sweden]].

Today, despite large-scale assimilation into the dominant Swedish culture, Finnish and Sami minorities continue to maintain their cultures and identities.\n\nDespite independent cultural presence, religious beliefs were subject to conversion in the 17th and 18th centuries resulting in Lapplanders generally leaving their original [[shamanism]] and converting to [[Religion in Sweden#Protestant Reformation|Lutheranism]]. Since the 19th century, Lappland has been particularly characterised by [[Laestadianism|Laestadian Lutheranism]].\n\nDuring the [[industrialization of Sweden]] in the late-19th century, natural resources (hydroelectricity, timber and minerals) from Lappland and surrounding provinces played a key role. Still, mining, forestry and hydroelectric power are the backbone of the local economy, together with municipal services. The unemployment has however been relatively high for several decades and many young people leave for the larger cities by the coast or in southern Sweden.\n\n==Geography==\nLocated in Sweden, Lapland is known for containing the [[Vindelfj\u00e4llen Nature Reserve]], one of the largest nature reserves in Sweden. Other parts of Lappland have been named a [[UNESCO]] [[World heritage site]], the [[Laponian area]], and the province contains some of the oldest and most spectacular [[national park]]s of northern Europe, e.g. [[Sarek National Park]], established in 1909. Lappland has an area of 109,702 square km (c. 42,300 sq miles), larger than [[Austria]] and almost equal to [[Portugal]].\n\n===National parks===\n*[[Abisko]]\n*[[Bj\u00f6rnlandet]]\n*[[Muddus]]\n*[[Padjelanta]]\n*[[Sarek National Park|Sarek]]\n*[[Stora Sj\u00f6fallet]]\n*[[Vadvetj\u00e5kka]]\n\n==Administration==\nThe traditional [[provinces of Sweden]] serve no administrative or political purposes but are cultural and historical entities. Administratively, Lappland constitutes the western part of two [[counties of Sweden]], [[Norrbotten County]] in the north and [[V\u00e4sterbotten County]] in the south. In contrast to most other areas of Sweden, there is more of an identification with the ''counties'' rather than to ''provinces''. Thus, most people in these counties refer to the entire county, including the areas in Lappland, when they say 'Norrbotten' or 'V\u00e4sterbotten'.\n\nCitizens of [[Sami people|Sami]] descent are eligible to stand and vote in elections for the Swedish [[Sami Parliament of Sweden|Sami Parliament]], which is the case with Sami people elsewhere in Sweden as well. The [[Sami language]] has an official minority status in [[Kiruna Municipality]], [[G\u00e4llivare Municipality]], [[Jokkmokk Municipality]] and [[Arjeplog Municipality]].\n\nThe following municipalities have their seats in Lapland:\n\n* [[Arjeplog Municipality|Arjeplog]]\n* [[Arvidsjaur Municipality|Arvidsjaur]]\n* [[Dorotea Municipality|Dorotea]]\n* [[G\u00e4llivare Municipality|G\u00e4llivare]]\n* [[Jokkmokk Municipality|Jokkmokk]]\n* [[Kiruna Municipality|Kiruna]]\n* [[Lycksele Municipality|Lycksele]]\n* [[Mal\u00e5 Municipality|Mal\u00e5]]\n* [[Sorsele Municipality|Sorsele]]\n* [[Storuman Municipality|Storuman]]\n* [[Vilhelmina Municipality|Vilhelmina]]\n* [[\u00c5sele Municipality|\u00c5sele]]\n\n==Population==\nAs of 31 December 2017, the population of Swedish Lappland is 91,333.<ref name=\"population\"/> Together with the rest of historical Lapland, the sum of the population is approximately 250,000.<ref>Finnish municipalities counted: Enonteki\u00f6, Inari, Utsjoki, Muonio, Kittil\u00e4 and Sodankyl\u00e4.

Blazon Swedish version: \"Argent, a Wildman statant Gules wrapped with birch leaves Vert on the head and around the waist holding a Club Or in dexter over the shoulder.\" The wildman used to be depicted with more features, impressively drawn muscles and a dour expression on his face.\n\nThe [[Wild man|wildman]] wielding a club as heraldic symbol of Lappland first appeared at the coronation of [[Charles IX of Sweden]] in 1607, then at the same king's burial in 1611. The colour red of his skin was decided only in 1949; before then various colours had been used (natural skin colour in the first half of the 20th century). The wildman, though unusual in heraldry, is an old symbol of the uncivilised north and appeared in books and woodcuts of the 16th century.\n\n==Climate==\nLappland has a [[subarctic climate]] in its lower areas, whereas a [[polar climate|polar]] variety can be found in [[Tarfala research station|Tarfala]], where the average high for the warmest month of the year (July) is lower than {{convert|10|C|F}} in mean temperatures. The southern parts of the province are significantly milder than the northern, due to the vast geographical differences. However, since Lappland is all made up of inland areas, maritime moderation is less significant than in the counties' coastal areas and in neighbouring [[Norway]], resulting in harsh winters. Southern areas at a lower elevation such as [[Lycksele]] also have relatively warm summers. Due to the [[arctic circle]], the northern areas of the province experience [[midnight sun]] and a moderate [[polar night]] with some civil twilight during opposite sides of the year.\n\n== Culture ==\n{{expand section|date=January 2015}}\nThe culture of the [[Sami people]], and the conservative Lutheran [[Laestadianism|Laestadian movement]] is prominent in the region.\n\n==Sports==\nFootball in the province is administered by [[Norrbottens Fotbollf\u00f6rbund]] and [[V\u00e4sterbottens Fotbollf\u00f6rbund]].\n\n==Marketing==\nAn EU-subsidised government tourism marketing organisation aiming to promote tourism in Northern Sweden has taken the brand name \"Swedish Lapland\". This name also covers towns in the coastal area of Gulf of Bothnia as well as the border area to Finland though neither areas are a part of the geographical province Swedish Lapland, rather the Lapland area as a whole in northern Scandinavia.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Laponia (historical province)|Laponia]] (the province prior to 1809, including the present-day Finnish part)\n*[[Lappmarken]]\n*[[National parks in Lapland]]\n*[[Lapland (Finland)|Finnish Lapland]]\n*[[S\u00e1pmi]] (the larger traditional territory of the [[Sami people|S\u00e1mi]], often called \"Lapland\" or \"Lappland\" in English)\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.swedishlapland.co.uk Swedish Lapland] Swedish Lapland, Sweden's northernmost destination\n*[http://lapland.arvidsjaur.eu Arvidsjaur.eu] - Arvidsjaur, In heart of Swedish Lapland\n*[http://viaterra.net/photopages/1990-2000/sweden-north.htm viaterra.net] - Photos from the North of Sweden (Abisko, Lapporten, Tornetr\u00e4sk)\n\n{{Provinces of Sweden}}\n{{Coord|65.929|N|16.743|E|source:svwiki_region:SE|format=dms|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:Provinces of Sweden]]\n[[Category:Lapland (Sweden)| ]]\n", "name_user": "Sph613", "label": "safe", "comment": "fixed typo in first section", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lapland_(Sweden)"}

Invented by [[Edward E. Simmons]] and [[Arthur C. Ruge]] in 1938, the most common type of strain gauge consists of an [[Electrical insulation|insulating]] flexible backing which supports a metallic foil pattern.  The gauge is attached to the object by a suitable adhesive, such as [[cyanoacrylate]].<ref>[http://www.efunda.com/designstandards/sensors/strain_gages/strain_gage_selection_matl.cfm Strain Gage: Materials<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  As the object is deformed, the foil is deformed, causing its [[electrical resistance]] to change.  This resistance change, usually measured using a [[Wheatstone bridge]], is related to the strain by the quantity known as the [[gauge factor]].\n\n==Physical operation==\n[[File:Unmounted strain gauge.jpg|thumb|An unmounted resistive foil strain gauge]]\n\nA strain gauge takes advantage of the physical property of [[Electrical resistance and conductance|electrical conductance]] and its dependence on the conductor's geometry. When an [[electrical conductor]] is stretched within the limits of its [[elasticity (physics)|elasticity]] such that it does not break or permanently deform, it will become narrower and longer, which increases its electrical resistance end-to-end.  Conversely, when a conductor is compressed such that it does not buckle, it will broaden and shorten, which decreases its electrical resistance end-to-end.  From the measured [[electrical resistance]] of the strain gauge, the amount of induced [[stress (physics)|stress]] may be inferred.\n\nA typical strain gauge arranges a long, thin conductive strip in a zig-zag pattern of parallel lines. This does not increase the sensitivity, since the percentage change in resistance for a given strain for the entire zig-zag is the same as for any single trace. A single linear trace would have to be extremely thin, hence liable to overheating (which would change its resistance and cause it to expand), or would need to be operated at a much lower voltage, making it difficult to measure resistance changes accurately.\n\n==Gauge factor==\nThe [[gauge factor]] <math>GF</math> is defined as:\n:<math>GF=\\frac{\\Delta R/R_G}{\\epsilon}</math>\nwhere \n:<math>\\Delta R</math> is the change in resistance caused by strain,\n:<math>R_G</math> is the resistance of the undeformed gauge, and\n:<math>\\epsilon</math> is strain.\n\nFor common metallic foil gauges, the gauge factor is usually a little over 2.<ref name=\"Strain Gage: Sensitivity\">[http://www.efunda.com/designstandards/sensors/strain_gages/strain_gage_sensitivity.cfm Strain Gage: Sensitivity<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  For a single active gauge and three dummy resistors of the same resistance about the active gauge in a balanced [[Wheatstone bridge]] configuration, the output sensor voltage <math>SV</math> from the bridge is approximately:\n:<math>SV=EV \\frac{GF \\cdot \\epsilon}4</math>\nwhere\n:<math>EV</math> is the bridge excitation voltage.\n\nFoil gauges typically have active areas of about 2\u201310&nbsp;mm<sup>2</sup> in size.  With careful installation, the correct gauge, and the correct adhesive, strains up to at least 10% can be measured.\n\n==In practice==\n\n[[Image:StrainGaugeVisualization.svg|frame|Visualization of the working concept behind the strain gauge on a [[Beam (structure)|beam]] under exaggerated bending]]\n\nAn excitation voltage is applied to input leads of the gauge network, and a voltage reading is taken from the output leads. Typical input voltages are 5&nbsp;V or 12&nbsp;V and typical output readings are in millivolts.\n\nFoil strain gauges are used in many situations. Different applications place different requirements on the gauge. In most cases the orientation of the strain gauge is significant.\n\nGauges attached to a [[load cell]] would normally be expected to remain stable over a period of years, if not decades; while those used to measure response in a dynamic experiment may only need to remain attached to the object for a few days, be energized for less than an hour, and operate for less than a second.\n\nStrain gauges are attached to the substrate with a special glue. The type of glue depends on the required lifetime of the measurement system. For short term measurements (up to some weeks) cyanoacrylate glue is appropriate, for long lasting installation epoxy glue is required. Usually epoxy glue requires high temperature curing (at about 80-100&nbsp;\u00b0C). The preparation of the surface where the strain gauge is to be glued is of the utmost importance. The surface must be smoothed (e.g. with very fine sand paper), deoiled with solvents, the solvent traces must then be removed and the strain gauge must be glued immediately after this to avoid oxidation or pollution of the prepared area. If these steps are not followed the strain gauge binding to the surface may be unreliable and unpredictable measurement errors may be generated.\n\nStrain gauge based technology is used commonly in the manufacture of [[pressure sensor]]s.  The gauges used in pressure sensors themselves are commonly made from silicon, polysilicon, metal film, thick film, and bonded foil.\n\n===Variations in temperature===\nVariations in temperature will cause a multitude of effects. The object will change in size by thermal expansion, which will be detected as a strain by the gauge. Resistance of the gauge will change, and resistance of the connecting wires will change.\n\nMost strain gauges are made from a [[constantan]] alloy.<ref>[http://www.vishaypg.com/docs/11055/tn505.pdf Constantan Alloy: Strain Gauge Selection<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Various constantan alloys and Karma alloys have been designed so that the temperature effects on the resistance of the strain gauge itself largely cancel out the resistance change of the gauge due to the thermal expansion of the object under test.  Because different materials have different amounts of thermal expansion, self-temperature compensation (STC) requires selecting a particular alloy matched to the material of the object under test.\n\nStrain gauges that are not self-temperature-compensated (such as isoelastic alloy) can be temperature compensated by use of the dummy gauge technique. A dummy gauge (identical to the active strain gauge) is installed on an unstrained sample of the same material as the test specimen. The sample with the dummy gauge is placed in thermal contact with the test specimen, adjacent to the active gauge. The dummy gauge is wired into a [[Wheatstone bridge]] on an adjacent arm to the active gauge so that the temperature effects on the active and dummy gauges cancel each other.<ref>Shull, Larry C., \"Basic Circuits\", Hannah, R.L. and Reed, S.E. (Eds.) (1992).''Strain Gage Users' Manual'', p. 122. Society for Experimental Mechanics. {{ISBN|0-912053-36-4}}.</ref> ([[Murphy's law]] was originally coined in response to a set of gauges being incorrectly wired into a Wheatstone bridge.<ref>Spark, N. (2006). ''A History of Murphy's Law''. Periscope Film. {{ISBN|978-0-9786388-9-4}}</ref>)\n\nEvery material reacts when it heats up or when it cools down. This will cause strain gauges to register a deformation in the material which will make it change signal. To prevent this from happening strain gauges are made so they will compensate this change due to temperature. Dependent on the material of the surface where the strain gauge is assembled on, a different expansion can be measured.\n\nTemperature effects on the lead wires can be cancelled by using a \"3-wire bridge\" or a \"4-wire ohm circuit\"<ref>[http://www.omega.com/literature/transactions/volume3/strain2.html The Strain Gage<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> (also called a \"4-wire [[Kelvin connection]]\").\n\nIn any case it is a good engineering practice to keep the Wheatstone bridge voltage drive low enough to avoid the self heating of the strain gauge. The self heating of the strain gauge depends on its mechanical characteristic (large strain gauges are less prone to self heating). Low voltage drive levels of the bridge reduce the sensitivity of the overall system.\n\n==Errors and compensations==\n* Zero Offset - If the impedance of the four gauge arms are not exactly the same after bonding the gauge to the force collector, there will be a zero offset which can be compensated by introducing a parallel resistor to one or more of the gauge arms.\n* Temperature coefficient of gauge factor (TCGF) is the change of sensitivity of the device to strain with change in temperature. This is generally compensated for by the introduction of a fixed resistance in the input leg, whereby the effective supplied voltage will decrease with a temperature increase, compensating for the increase in sensitivity with the temperature increase. This is known as modulus compensation in transducer circuits. As the temperature rises the load cell element becomes more elastic and therefore under a constant load will deform more and lead to an increase in output; but the load is still the same. The clever bit in all this is that the resistor in the bridge supply must be a temperature sensitive resistor that is matched to both the material to which the gauge is bonded and also to the gauge element material. The value of that resistor is dependent on both of those values and can be calculated. In simple terms if the output increases then the resistor value also increase thereby reducing the net voltage to the transducer. Get the resistor  value right and you will see no change.\n* Zero shift with temperature - If the TCGF of each gauge is not the same, there will be a zero shift with temperature. This is also caused by anomalies in the force collector. This is usually compensated for with one or more resistors strategically placed in the compensation network.\n* Linearity is an error whereby the sensitivity changes across the pressure range. This is commonly a function of the force collection thickness selection for the intended pressure and the quality of the bonding.\n* Hysteresis is an error of return to zero after pressure excursion.\n* Repeatability - This error is sometimes tied-in with hysteresis but is across the pressure range.\n* EMI induced errors - As strain gauges output voltage is in the mV range, even \u03bcV if the Wheatstone bridge voltage drive is kept low to avoid self heating of the element, special care must be taken in output signal amplification to avoid amplifying also the superimposed noise. A solution which is frequently adopted is to use \"carrier frequency\" amplifiers which convert the voltage variation into a frequency variation (as in VCOs) and have a narrow bandwidth thus reducing out of band EMI.\n* Overloading \u2013 If a strain gauge is loaded beyond its design limit (measured in microstrain) its performance degrades and can not be recovered. Normally good engineering practice suggests not to stress strain gauges beyond \u00b13000 microstrain.\n* Humidity \u2013 If the wires connecting the strain gauge to the signal conditioner are not protected against humidity, such as bare wire, corrosion can occur, leading to parasitic resistance.  This can allow currents to flow between the wires and the substrate to which the strain gauge is glued, or between the two wires directly, introducing an error which competes with the current flowing through the strain gauge. For this reason, high-current, low-resistance strain gauges (120 ohm) are less prone to this type of error. To avoid this error it is sufficient to protect the strain gauges wires with insulating enamel (e.g., epoxy or polyurethane type). Strain gauges with unprotected wires may be used only in a dry laboratory environment but not in an industrial one.\n\nIn some applications, strain gauges add mass and damping to the vibration profiles of the hardware they are intended to measure. In the turbomachinery industry, one used alternative to strain gauge technology in the measurement of vibrations on rotating hardware is the [[non-intrusive stress measurement system]], which allows measurement of blade vibrations without any blade or disc-mounted hardware...\n\n==Geometries of strain gauges==\n[[File:Strain gauge geometries.png|thumb|Geometries of strain gauges]]\n\nThe following different kind of strain gauges are available in the market:\n* Linear strain gauges\n* Membrane Rosette strain gauges\n* Double linear strain gauges\n* Full bridge strain gauges\n* Shear strain gauges\n* Half bridge strain gauges\n* Column strain gauges\n* 45\u00b0-Rosette (3 measuring directions)\n* 90\u00b0-Rosette (2 measuring directions).\n\n==Other types==\nFor measurements of small strain, semiconductor strain gauges, so called [[Piezoresistive effect|piezoresistors]], are often preferred over foil gauges. A [[piezoresistor|semiconductor gauge]] usually has a larger gauge factor than a foil gauge.  Semiconductor gauges tend to be more expensive, more sensitive to temperature changes, and are more fragile than foil gauges.\n\nNanoparticle-based strain gauges emerge as a new promising technology. These resistive sensors whose active area is made by an assembly of conductive nanoparticles, such as [[Colloidal gold|gold]] or [[Carbon black|carbon]], combine a high gauge factor, a large deformation range and a small electrical consumption due to their high impedance.\n\nIn biological measurements, especially [[Hemodynamics|blood flow]] and tissue swelling, a variant called '''mercury-in-rubber strain gauge''' is used. This kind of strain gauge consists of a small amount of liquid mercury enclosed in a small rubber tube, which is applied around e.g., a toe or leg. Swelling of the body part results in stretching of the tube, making it both longer and thinner, which increases electrical resistance.\n\n[[Fiber optic sensor|Fiber optic sensing]] can be employed to measure strain along an [[optical fiber]]. Measurements can be distributed along the fiber, or taken at predetermined points on the fiber.  The 2010 [[America's Cup]] boats [[Alinghi 5]] and [[USA-17]] both employ embedded sensors of this type.<ref>{{Cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/09/science/09sail.html | title=America's Cup Rivals Race with the Wind at Their Wings| newspaper=The New York Times| date=2010-02-08| last1=Fountain| first1=Henry}}</ref>\n[[File:L\u00fcdersband measured with digital image correlation (DIC) from LIMESS.gif|alt=Digital Image Correlation results on a material testing coupon|thumb|356x356px|Example of non-contact strain measurement using [[Digital image correlation and tracking|digital image correlation]] on a material testing coupon showing moving strain structures called [[L\u00fcders band]]s]]\nOther optical measuring techniques can be used to measure strains like [[electronic speckle pattern interferometry]] or [[Digital image correlation and tracking|digital image correlation]].\n\nMicroscale strain gauges are widely used in [[microelectromechanical systems]] (MEMS) to measure  strains  such as those induced by force, acceleration, pressure or sound.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Bryzek|first1=J.|last2=Roundy|first2=S.|last3=Bircumshaw|first3=B.|last4=Chung|first4=C.|last5=Castellino|first5=K.|last6=Stetter|first6=J.R.|last7=Vestel|first7=M.|title=Marvelous MEMS|journal=IEEE Circuits and Devices Magazine|date=10 April 2006|volume=22|issue=2|pages=8\u201328|doi=10.1109/MCD.2006.1615241}}</ref> As example, airbags in cars are often triggered with MEMS accelerometers.

From the measured [[electrical resistance]] of the strain gauge, the amount of induced [[stress (physics)|stress]] may be inferred.\n\nA typical strain gauge arranges a long, thin conductive strip in a zig-zag pattern of parallel lines. This does not increase the sensitivity, since the percentage change in resistance for a given strain for the entire zig-zag is the same as for any single trace. A single linear trace would have to be extremely thin, hence liable to overheating (which would change its resistance and cause it to expand), or would need to be operated at a much lower voltage, making it difficult to measure resistance changes accurately.\n\n==Gauge factor==\nThe [[gauge factor]] <math>GF</math> is defined as:\n:<math>GF=\\frac{\\Delta R/R_G}{\\epsilon}</math>\nwhere \n:<math>\\Delta R</math> is the change in resistance caused by strain,\n:<math>R_G</math> is the resistance of the undeformed gauge, and\n:<math>\\epsilon</math> is strain.\n\nFor common metallic foil gauges, the gauge factor is usually a little over 2.<ref name=\"Strain Gage: Sensitivity\">[http://www.efunda.com/designstandards/sensors/strain_gages/strain_gage_sensitivity.cfm Strain Gage: Sensitivity<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  For a single active gauge and three dummy resistors of the same resistance about the active gauge in a balanced [[Wheatstone bridge]] configuration, the output sensor voltage <math>SV</math> from the bridge is approximately:\n:<math>SV=EV \\frac{GF \\cdot \\epsilon}4</math>\nwhere\n:<math>EV</math> is the bridge excitation voltage.\n\nFoil gauges typically have active areas of about 2\u201310&nbsp;mm<sup>2</sup> in size.  With careful installation, the correct gauge, and the correct adhesive, strains up to at least 10% can be measured.\n\n==In practice==\n\n[[Image:StrainGaugeVisualization.svg|frame|Visualization of the working concept behind the strain gauge on a [[Beam (structure)|beam]] under exaggerated bending]]\n\nAn excitation voltage is applied to input leads of the gauge network, and a voltage reading is taken from the output leads. Typical input voltages are 5&nbsp;V or 12&nbsp;V and typical output readings are in millivolts.\n\nFoil strain gauges are used in many situations. Different applications place different requirements on the gauge. In most cases the orientation of the strain gauge is significant.\n\nGauges attached to a [[load cell]] would normally be expected to remain stable over a period of years, if not decades; while those used to measure response in a dynamic experiment may only need to remain attached to the object for a few days, be energized for less than an hour, and operate for less than a second.\n\nStrain gauges are attached to the substrate with a special glue. The type of glue depends on the required lifetime of the measurement system. For short term measurements (up to some weeks) cyanoacrylate glue is appropriate, for long lasting installation epoxy glue is required. Usually epoxy glue requires high temperature curing (at about 80-100&nbsp;\u00b0C). The preparation of the surface where the strain gauge is to be glued is of the utmost importance. The surface must be smoothed (e.g. with very fine sand paper), deoiled with solvents, the solvent traces must then be removed and the strain gauge must be glued immediately after this to avoid oxidation or pollution of the prepared area. If these steps are not followed the strain gauge binding to the surface may be unreliable and unpredictable measurement errors may be generated.\n\nStrain gauge based technology is utilized commonly in the manufacture of [[pressure sensor]]s.  The gauges used in pressure sensors themselves are commonly made from silicon, polysilicon, metal film, thick film, and bonded foil.\n\n===Variations in temperature===\nVariations in temperature will cause a multitude of effects. The object will change in size by thermal expansion, which will be detected as a strain by the gauge. Resistance of the gauge will change, and resistance of the connecting wires will change.\n\nMost strain gauges are made from a [[constantan]] alloy.<ref>[http://www.vishaypg.com/docs/11055/tn505.pdf Constantan Alloy: Strain Gauge Selection<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Various constantan alloys and Karma alloys have been designed so that the temperature effects on the resistance of the strain gauge itself largely cancel out the resistance change of the gauge due to the thermal expansion of the object under test.  Because different materials have different amounts of thermal expansion, self-temperature compensation (STC) requires selecting a particular alloy matched to the material of the object under test.\n\nStrain gauges that are not self-temperature-compensated (such as isoelastic alloy) can be temperature compensated by use of the dummy gauge technique. A dummy gauge (identical to the active strain gauge) is installed on an unstrained sample of the same material as the test specimen. The sample with the dummy gauge is placed in thermal contact with the test specimen, adjacent to the active gauge. The dummy gauge is wired into a [[Wheatstone bridge]] on an adjacent arm to the active gauge so that the temperature effects on the active and dummy gauges cancel each other.<ref>Shull, Larry C., \"Basic Circuits\", Hannah, R.L. and Reed, S.E. (Eds.) (1992).''Strain Gage Users' Manual'', p. 122. Society for Experimental Mechanics. {{ISBN|0-912053-36-4}}.</ref> ([[Murphy's law]] was originally coined in response to a set of gauges being incorrectly wired into a Wheatstone bridge.<ref>Spark, N. (2006). ''A History of Murphy's Law''. Periscope Film. {{ISBN|978-0-9786388-9-4}}</ref>)\n\nEvery material reacts when it heats up or when it cools down. This will cause strain gauges to register a deformation in the material which will make it change signal. To prevent this from happening strain gauges are made so they will compensate this change due to temperature. Dependent on the material of the surface where the strain gauge is assembled on, a different expansion can be measured.\n\nTemperature effects on the lead wires can be cancelled by using a \"3-wire bridge\" or a \"4-wire ohm circuit\"<ref>[http://www.omega.com/literature/transactions/volume3/strain2.html The Strain Gage<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> (also called a \"4-wire [[Kelvin connection]]\").\n\nIn any case it is a good engineering practice to keep the Wheatstone bridge voltage drive low enough to avoid the self heating of the strain gauge. The self heating of the strain gauge depends on its mechanical characteristic (large strain gauges are less prone to self heating). Low voltage drive levels of the bridge reduce the sensitivity of the overall system.\n\n==Errors and compensations==\n* Zero Offset - If the impedance of the four gauge arms are not exactly the same after bonding the gauge to the force collector, there will be a zero offset which can be compensated by introducing a parallel resistor to one or more of the gauge arms.\n* Temperature coefficient of gauge factor (TCGF) is the change of sensitivity of the device to strain with change in temperature. This is generally compensated for by the introduction of a fixed resistance in the input leg, whereby the effective supplied voltage will decrease with a temperature increase, compensating for the increase in sensitivity with the temperature increase. This is known as modulus compensation in transducer circuits. As the temperature rises the load cell element becomes more elastic and therefore under a constant load will deform more and lead to an increase in output; but the load is still the same. The clever bit in all this is that the resistor in the bridge supply must be a temperature sensitive resistor that is matched to both the material to which the gauge is bonded and also to the gauge element material. The value of that resistor is dependent on both of those values and can be calculated. In simple terms if the output increases then the resistor value also increase thereby reducing the net voltage to the transducer. Get the resistor  value right and you will see no change.\n* Zero shift with temperature - If the TCGF of each gauge is not the same, there will be a zero shift with temperature. This is also caused by anomalies in the force collector. This is usually compensated for with one or more resistors strategically placed in the compensation network.\n* Linearity is an error whereby the sensitivity changes across the pressure range. This is commonly a function of the force collection thickness selection for the intended pressure and the quality of the bonding.\n* Hysteresis is an error of return to zero after pressure excursion.\n* Repeatability - This error is sometimes tied-in with hysteresis but is across the pressure range.\n* EMI induced errors - As strain gauges output voltage is in the mV range, even \u03bcV if the Wheatstone bridge voltage drive is kept low to avoid self heating of the element, special care must be taken in output signal amplification to avoid amplifying also the superimposed noise. A solution which is frequently adopted is to use \"carrier frequency\" amplifiers which convert the voltage variation into a frequency variation (as in VCOs) and have a narrow bandwidth thus reducing out of band EMI.\n* Overloading \u2013 If a strain gauge is loaded beyond its design limit (measured in microstrain) its performance degrades and can not be recovered. Normally good engineering practice suggests not to stress strain gauges beyond \u00b13000 microstrain.\n* Humidity \u2013 If the wires connecting the strain gauge to the signal conditioner are not protected against humidity, such as bare wire, corrosion can occur, leading to parasitic resistance.  This can allow currents to flow between the wires and the substrate to which the strain gauge is glued, or between the two wires directly, introducing an error which competes with the current flowing through the strain gauge. For this reason, high-current, low-resistance strain gauges (120 ohm) are less prone to this type of error. To avoid this error it is sufficient to protect the strain gauges wires with insulating enamel (e.g., epoxy or polyurethane type). Strain gauges with unprotected wires may be used only in a dry laboratory environment but not in an industrial one.\n\nIn some applications, strain gauges add mass and damping to the vibration profiles of the hardware they are intended to measure. In the turbomachinery industry, one used alternative to strain gauge technology in the measurement of vibrations on rotating hardware is the [[non-intrusive stress measurement system]], which allows measurement of blade vibrations without any blade or disc-mounted hardware...\n\n==Geometries of strain gauges==\n[[File:Strain gauge geometries.png|thumb|Geometries of strain gauges]]\n\nThe following different kind of strain gauges are available in the market:\n* Linear strain gauges\n* Membrane Rosette strain gauges\n* Double linear strain gauges\n* Full bridge strain gauges\n* Shear strain gauges\n* Half bridge strain gauges\n* Column strain gauges\n* 45\u00b0-Rosette (3 measuring directions)\n* 90\u00b0-Rosette (2 measuring directions).\n\n==Other types==\nFor measurements of small strain, semiconductor strain gauges, so called [[Piezoresistive effect|piezoresistors]], are often preferred over foil gauges. A [[piezoresistor|semiconductor gauge]] usually has a larger gauge factor than a foil gauge.  Semiconductor gauges tend to be more expensive, more sensitive to temperature changes, and are more fragile than foil gauges.\n\nNanoparticle-based strain gauges emerge as a new promising technology. These resistive sensors whose active area is made by an assembly of conductive nanoparticles, such as [[Colloidal gold|gold]] or [[Carbon black|carbon]], combine a high gauge factor, a large deformation range and a small electrical consumption due to their high impedance.\n\nIn biological measurements, especially [[Hemodynamics|blood flow]] and tissue swelling, a variant called '''mercury-in-rubber strain gauge''' is used. This kind of strain gauge consists of a small amount of liquid mercury enclosed in a small rubber tube, which is applied around e.g., a toe or leg. Swelling of the body part results in stretching of the tube, making it both longer and thinner, which increases electrical resistance.\n\n[[Fiber optic sensor|Fiber optic sensing]] can be employed to measure strain along an [[optical fiber]]. Measurements can be distributed along the fiber, or taken at predetermined points on the fiber.  The 2010 [[America's Cup]] boats [[Alinghi 5]] and [[USA-17]] both employ embedded sensors of this type.<ref>{{Cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/09/science/09sail.html | title=America's Cup Rivals Race with the Wind at Their Wings| newspaper=The New York Times| date=2010-02-08| last1=Fountain| first1=Henry}}</ref>\n[[File:L\u00fcdersband measured with digital image correlation (DIC) from LIMESS.gif|alt=Digital Image Correlation results on a material testing coupon|thumb|356x356px|Example of non-contact strain measurement using [[Digital image correlation and tracking|digital image correlation]] on a material testing coupon showing moving strain structures called [[L\u00fcders band]]s]]\nOther optical measuring techniques can be used to measure strains like [[electronic speckle pattern interferometry]] or [[Digital image correlation and tracking|digital image correlation]].\n\nMicroscale strain gauges are widely used in [[microelectromechanical systems]] (MEMS) to measure  strains  such as those induced by force, acceleration, pressure or sound.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Bryzek|first1=J.|last2=Roundy|first2=S.|last3=Bircumshaw|first3=B.|last4=Chung|first4=C.|last5=Castellino|first5=K.|last6=Stetter|first6=J.R.|last7=Vestel|first7=M.|title=Marvelous MEMS|journal=IEEE Circuits and Devices Magazine|date=10 April 2006|volume=22|issue=2|pages=8\u201328|doi=10.1109/MCD.2006.1615241}}</ref> As example, airbags in cars are often triggered with MEMS accelerometers.

In October 2008 one of Brushwood's childhood heroes, [[Richard Garriott]], performed a magic trick he learned from ''Scam School'' while he was aboard the [[International Space Station]].<ref name=skepticality20090630 /><ref>{{cite web|title=Magic Tricks in Space \u2013 Scam School|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0_f_RzqZ2Q|website=YouTube|accessdate=29 July 2014}}</ref> When [[Discovery Digital Networks]] purchased Revision 3 Brushwood used it as an opportunity to move production of ''Scam School'' from the [[San Francisco Bay Area|San Francisco Bay area]] to [[Austin, Texas]] where he currently lives with his wife and three children.<ref name=capital8 /><ref name=\"The Daily Texan\">{{cite web|url=http://www.dailytexanonline.com/2015/10/19/ut-alumnus-shares-secrets-behind-magic-tricks-on-youtube-channel |last=Walsh |first=Katie| title=UT alumnus shares secrets behind magic tricks on YouTube channel |date= 20 October 2015 |accessdate=7 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Repertoire==\n[[File:Brian Brushwood eating fire at TWiT's Grand Opening party.webm|thumb|Brian Brushwood [[eating fire]] at TWiT's Grand Opening party]]\n[[File:Brian Brushwood and Evan Bernstein at Dragon*Con 2011.jpg|thumbnail|250px|right|Brian \"Shwood\" Brushwood and [[The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe|Evan Bernstein]] during a live recording of ''[[George Hrab#Geologic Podcast|The Geologic Podcast]]'' at [[Dragon*Con]] 2011 in [[Atlanta, GA]]]]\n[[File:Veronica Belmont and Brian Brushwood.jpg|thumb|[[Veronica Belmont]] and Brushwood preparing for the ''Game On!'' internet show 13 November 2011]]\n\n===Stage show===\nBrushwood started his professional stage show in 1999<ref>{{cite web|last1=Whitney|first1=Daisy|title=On the Horizon: Brian Brushwood|url=http://www.tvweek.com/in-depth/2009/06/on-the-horizon-brian-brushwood/|website=TVWeek|publisher=Crain Communications Inc.|date=22 June 2009|accessdate=7 August 2014}}</ref> and now performs 100\u2013200 live shows each year on college campuses across the United States.<ref name=sz100>{{cite web|last1=Saunders|authorlink=Richard Saunders (skeptic)|first1=Richard|title=Episode #100|url=http://skepticzone.libsyn.com/the-skeptic-zone-100-17-sep-2010|website=The Skeptic Zone|accessdate=27 July 2014|date=17 September 2010}}</ref> His ''Bizarre Magic'' show combines old sideshow stunts, mind reading, traditional magic and comedy.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Tran|first1=Quan|title=Bizarre Magic: Brian Brushwood|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2HVYEveOBw|accessdate=27 July 2014}}</ref> Conversations with audience members after performances inspired Brushwood to develop his ''Scams, Sasquatch, and the Supernatural'' lecture in 2004.<ref name=sz100 /><ref name=sgu205>{{cite web|title=Podcast #205 - June 16th, 2009|url=http://www.theskepticsguide.org/podcast/sgu/205|website=The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe|accessdate=1 August 2014|date=16 June 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Scams, Sasquatch, and the Supernatural Full Lecture|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPUxFRcTpfA|website=YouTube|accessdate=11 August 2014|date=29 October 2012}}</ref> Its content was derived from the [[pseudoscience]] course Brushwood took as an undergraduate<ref name=sgu205 /> and covers [[paranormal]] topics and how to detect fakes.

Brushwood responded,\n\n{{quote|Part of the reason I love educating the masses as how to deceive is from my experience, because I got into magic before I took this pseudoscience and paranormal course, so I had these tools on how to fool people and I just had this vague understanding that people are really easy to fool, and it's not that we are broken, or dumb, or bad, or whatever.  It's that the brain is built a certain way and magicians take advantage of that.  And, it was only after taking the pseudoscience class that it crystallized everything and I realized that that's exactly what scam artists do as well.  So, if I can get more people familiar with the tools and familiar with how easy it is to deceive other people, maybe more people will begin to question their own experiences.<ref>{{cite web|title=''Brian Brushwood - Scams, Swindles and Skepticism''|url=http://www.pointofinquiry.org/brian_brushwood_scams_swindles_and_skepticism/|website=[[Point of Inquiry]]|publisher=[[Center for Inquiry]]|accessdate=10 January 2017|date=3 September 2010}}</ref>}}\n\n==== Hair ====\nBrushwood's signature hairstyle was modelled after [[Guile (Street Fighter)|Guile]] from ''[[Street Fighter II: The World Warrior|Street Fighter II]]''<ref name=tldl68>{{cite web|title=Too Long; Didn't Listen Episode 68 \u2013 Character Genders and Death|url=http://mmoreporter.com/2013/10/03/too-long-didnt-listen-episode-68/|website=MMO Reporter|accessdate=1 August 2014|date=3 October 2013}}</ref> and took nine minutes to set up.

Brushwood responded,\n\n{{quote|Part of the reason I love educating the masses as how to deceive is from my experience, because I got into magic before I took this pseudoscience and paranormal course, so I had these tools on how to fool people and I just had this vague understanding that people are really easy to fool, and it's not that we are broken, or dumb, or bad, or whatever.  It's that the brain is built a certain way and magicians take advantage of that.  And, it was only after taking the pseudoscience class that it crystallized everything and I realized that that's exactly what scam artists do as well.  So, if I can get more people familiar with the tools and familiar with how easy it is to deceive other people, maybe more people will begin to question their own experiences.<ref>{{cite web|title=''Brian Brushwood - Scams, Swindles and Skepticism''|url=http://www.pointofinquiry.org/brian_brushwood_scams_swindles_and_skepticism/|website=[[Point of Inquiry]]|publisher=[[Center for Inquiry]]|accessdate=10 January 2017|date=3 September 2010}}</ref>}}\n\n==== Hair ====\nBrushwood's signature hairstyle was modelled after [[Guile (Street Fighter)|Guile]] from ''[[Street Fighter II: The World Warrior|Street Fighter II]]''<ref name=tldl68>{{cite web|title=Too Long; Didn't Listen Episode 68 \u2013 Character Genders and Death|url=http://mmoreporter.com/2013/10/03/too-long-didnt-listen-episode-68/|website=MMO Reporter|accessdate=1 August 2014|date=3 October 2013}}</ref> and took nine minutes to set up.

Their descendants also live in New Zealand, Australia, and the United States. Because of the scarcity of people on the island, many of the mutineers' children and grandchildren intermarried, with some marrying first and second cousins. Occasionally a new person would arrive on the island bringing with them a new surname (like Samuel Russell Warren from the United States, whose descendants still live on the island today).\n\nThe nine remaining mutineers arrived on the island on 15 January 1790 with eleven Tahitian women and six men. Each of the mutineers took one woman as a wife, with the three remaining women to be shared by the six Tahitian men, which they resented. According to author Caroline Alexander, the women were \"passed around from one 'husband' to the other\".<ref>{{cite book\n|authorlink= Caroline Alexander (author)|last= Alexander1|first= Caroline |title= The Bounty |publisher= Harper Collins |location= London |year= 2003 |isbn=978-0-00-257221-7}}</ref>{{rp|369}} Fletcher Christian, Ned Young, John Adams, John Mills, William McCoy, and Matthew Quintal had relationships with six Tahitian women. Mauatua, Toofaiti, Vahineatua, and Teio had children from two of the mutineers and one of their sons. Tevarua and Teraura had only one partner. Together they had 24 children, who in turn had 77 children.\n\nWhen John Williams and John Adams' wives died, they commandeered two of the Polynesian men's wives, who plotted to kill the men in retribution. Two of the plotters were killed instead. On 20 September 1793, the four remaining Polynesian men stole muskets and killed Christian, Mills, Brown, Martin, and Williams. The remaining seamen\u2014Adams, McCoy, Quintal, and Young, with the assistance of Teraura, the wife of Ned Young\u2014who beheaded the Polynesian Tetahiti while he slept\u2014soon killed the Polynesian men.<ref name=teraura/> In 1798, McCoy built a [[still]]. He, Quintal, and some of the women were continually drunk. On 20 April 1798, McCoy attached a rock to his neck with a rope and leaped over a cliff to his death. Quintal became increasingly erratic and threatened to kill the other seamen and their wives. In 1799, Adams and Young killed him. Young died of an asthma attack in 1800. Adams lived until 1829.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Marks |first1=Kathy |title=Lost Paradise: From Mutiny on the Bounty to a Modern-Day Legacy of Sexual Mayhem, the Dark Secrets of Pitcairn Island Revealed |date=2009 |publisher=Simon and Schuster |isbn=9781416597841 |page=16 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aBl_hS0YgvIC |accessdate=5 March 2019 |language=en}}</ref>\n\n{{Tree list}}\n* '''[[Fletcher Christian]]''' (25 September 1764 \u2013 20 September 1793)\n* m.

Tom was the son of Frederick Christian, grandson of Daniel Christian, great-grandson of Thursday Christian, and great-great-grandson of Friday Christian, who himself, was the son of Fletcher Christian. The cause of Tom's death was complications of a recent stroke, said his daughter Jacqueline Christian.<ref name=NYTobit>{{cite news|last=Fox|first=Margalit|title=Tom Christian, Descendant of Bounty Mutineer, Dies at 77|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/24/world/asia/tom-christian-descendant-of-bounty-mutineer-dies-at-77.html?pagewanted=2&_r=0&hp|accessdate=24 August 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=23 August 2013}}</ref>\n* [[Rosalind Amelia Young]] (13 August 1853 \u2013 1 February 1924), historian and greatgrandaughter of [[John Adams (mutineer)|John Adams]]\n\nThe majority of the many [[list of rulers of the Pitcairn Islands|rulers of the Pitcairn Islands]] have been descendants of the ''Bounty'' mutineers, till this day.\n\nIn 1935 - in the wake of their successful American blockbuster movie ''[[Mutiny on the Bounty (1935 film)|Mutiny on the Bounty]]'', which premiered that year - the [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM Studios]] also shot a short documentary with the title \"Pitcairn Island Today\" (a Eugene H. Roth production, narrated by Carey Wilson).<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykgDX-dYN6g''Pitcairn Island Today (1935)''], accessed on 14 December 2014</ref><ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0301732/fullcredits?ref_=tt_ov_st_sm''Pitcairn Island Today (1935) - Full Cast & Crew''], accessed on 14 December 2014. NB! the film poster on this page erroneously depicts that of the blockbuster movie!</ref> It tells the story of some of the descendants of the ''Bounty'' mutineers, who were natives of Pitcairn and inhabitants of the only village of the island, [[Adamstown, Pitcairn Islands|Adamstown]].\n\nThe list of descendants mentioned and presented in this MGM documentary includes:\n\n* William Christian, approx. 60\u201370 years old (judging by appearance), farmer, presented as \"Fletcher Christians great grandson\".\n* Benjamin Young, 84 years old (i.e. born around 1851), blacksmith, presented as the \"great grandson of a happy young Midshipman of the Bounty\" (that would be [[Ned Young|Edward \"Ned\" Young]]).\n* Edward Christian, approx. 55\u201360 years old (judging by appearance), stonecutter, presumably another descendant of Fletcher Christian.\n* \"Pastor Christian\", pastor and mayor of the island. Most likely he is to be identified as [[Edgar Allen Christian]] (at that time 52 years old, an age corresponding to his appearance in the video). Furthermore, this assumption is based on the fact that he (as seen later in the footage) appears to have signed a marriage announcement in his function of being the \"Magistrate\" of the island (see below). In earlier and later years, however, Edgar A. Christian's cousin [[Charles Richard Parkin Christian]] too held this double office of being both the religious leader as well as the Chief Magistrate of Pitcairn (cf. [[List of rulers of the Pitcairn Islands]]).<ref>[http://www.stamps.gov.pn/ParkinChristian.html''Prominent Pitcairners - Part I: Parkin Christian''], accessed on 14 December 2014</ref>\n* (Aunt) Annie McCoy, 70\u201380 years old (judging by appearance), descendant of Able Seaman [[William McCoy (mutineer)|William McCoy]].\n* Rebecca Young, approx. 12\u201320 years old (judging by appearance), presumably another descendant of Midshipman Ned Young.\n* Allan Christian and Eva Christian, a couple (of likely young age?) whose intention of marriage is officially signed and publicly announced by \"Edgar Christian - Magistrate\" (during the time of shooting the documentary).\n* David Young, a newborn baby (who nearly died because the doctor came by ship from abroad and almost arrived too late), yet another descendant of Midshipman Ned Young.\n\nOn top of those, three more people are mentioned in the MGM documentary: Andrew Warren (grandson of a whaler who came to Pitcairn around 1875, thus being no descendant of the mutineers), as well as Dora Warren and Roy Clark, whose exact direct descent from the mutineers (or lack of such) remains unclear, when judging only from the information that the documentary reveals.\n\nA 1962 documentary, ''Pitcairn People'' (directed by [[Peter Newington]], narrated by [[Patrick Wymark]]), was produced by the [[British Petroleum Company]]. It featured many of the island residents of that time. Another documentary, ''Miracle on Pitcairn Island'', was produced in the 1960s by the [[General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists]] (filmed and written by Eric Were, narrated by Neal C. Wilson). It featured many of the same residents.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Mutiny on the Bounty}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Bounty descendants}}\n[[Category:Australia history-related lists]]\n[[Category:French Polynesia-related lists]]\n[[Category:History of Norfolk Island]]\n[[Category:Mutiny on the Bounty|Descendants]]\n[[Category:People from Norfolk Island]]\n[[Category:Pitcairn Islands people]]\n[[Category:HMS Bounty mutineers|Descendants]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2012}}\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:Descendants of the ''Bounty'' mutineers}}\nThe '''descendants of the [[Mutiny on the Bounty|''Bounty'' mutineers]]''' and their [[Tahitians|Tahitian]] consorts include the modern-day [[Pitcairn Islanders]] as well as a little less than half of the population of [[Norfolk Island]]. Their descendants also live in New Zealand, Australia, and the United States. Because of the scarcity of people on the island, many of the mutineers' children and grandchildren intermarried, with some marrying first and second cousins. Occasionally a new person would arrive on the island bringing with them a new surname (like Samuel Russell Warren from the United States, whose descendants still live on the island today).\n\nThe nine remaining mutineers arrived on the island on 15 January 1790 with eleven Tahitian women and six men. Each of the mutineers took one woman as a wife, with the three remaining women to be shared by the six Tahitian men, which they resented. According to author Caroline Alexander, the women were \"passed around from one 'husband' to the other\".<ref>{{cite book\n|authorlink= Caroline Alexander (author)|last= Alexander1|first= Caroline |title= The Bounty |publisher= Harper Collins |location= London |year= 2003 |isbn=978-0-00-257221-7}}</ref>{{rp|369}} Fletcher Christian, Ned Young, John Adams, John Mills, William McCoy, and Matthew Quintal had relationships with six Tahitian women. Mauatua, Toofaiti, Vahineatua, and Teio had children from two of the mutineers and one of their sons. Tevarua and Teraura had only one partner. Together they had 24 children, who in turn had 77 children.\n\nWhen John Williams and John Adams' wives died, they commandeered two of the Polynesian men's wives, who plotted to kill the men in retribution. Two of the plotters were killed instead. On 20 September 1793, the four remaining Polynesian men stole muskets and killed Christian, Mills, Brown, Martin, and Williams. The remaining seamen\u2014Adams, McCoy, Quintal, and Young, with the assistance of Teraura, the wife of Ned Young\u2014who beheaded the Polynesian Tetahiti while he slept\u2014soon killed the Polynesian men.<ref name=teraura/> In 1798, McCoy built a [[still]]. He, Quintal, and some of the women were continually drunk. On 20 April 1798, McCoy attached a rock to his neck with a rope and leaped over a cliff to his death. Quintal became increasingly erratic and threatened to kill the other seamen and their wives. In 1799, Adams and Young killed him. Young died of an asthma attack in 1800. Adams lived until 1829.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Marks |first1=Kathy |title=Lost Paradise: From Mutiny on the Bounty to a Modern-Day Legacy of Sexual Mayhem, the Dark Secrets of Pitcairn Island Revealed |date=2009 |publisher=Simon and Schuster |isbn=9781416597841 |page=16 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aBl_hS0YgvIC |accessdate=5 March 2019 |language=en}}</ref>\n\n{{Tree list}}\n* '''[[Fletcher Christian]]''' (25 September 1764 \u2013 20 September 1793)\n* m.

The cause of Tom's death was complications of a recent stroke, said his daughter Jacqueline Christian.<ref name=NYTobit>{{cite news|last=Fox|first=Margalit|title=Tom Christian, Descendant of Bounty Mutineer, Dies at 77|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/24/world/asia/tom-christian-descendant-of-bounty-mutineer-dies-at-77.html?pagewanted=2&_r=0&hp|accessdate=24 August 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=23 August 2013}}</ref>\n* [[Rosalind Amelia Young]] (13 August 1853 \u2013 1 February 1924), historian and greatgrandaughter of [[John Adams (mutineer)|John Adams]]\n\nThe majority of the many [[list of rulers of the Pitcairn Islands|rulers of the Pitcairn Islands]] have been descendants of the ''Bounty'' mutineers, till this day.\n\nIn 1935 - in the wake of their successful American blockbuster movie ''[[Mutiny on the Bounty (1935 film)|Mutiny on the Bounty]]'', which premiered that year - the [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM Studios]] also shot a short documentary with the title \"Pitcairn Island Today\" (a Eugene H. Roth production, narrated by Carey Wilson).<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykgDX-dYN6g''Pitcairn Island Today (1935)''], accessed on 14 December 2014</ref><ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0301732/fullcredits?ref_=tt_ov_st_sm''Pitcairn Island Today (1935) - Full Cast & Crew''], accessed on 14 December 2014. NB! the film poster on this page erroneously depicts that of the blockbuster movie!</ref> It tells the story of some of the descendants of the ''Bounty'' mutineers, who were natives of Pitcairn and inhabitants of the only village of the island, [[Adamstown, Pitcairn Islands|Adamstown]].\n\nThe list of descendants mentioned and presented in this MGM documentary includes:\n\n* William Christian, approx. 60\u201370 years old (judging by appearance), farmer, presented as \"Fletcher Christians great grandson\".\n* Benjamin Young, 84 years old (i.e. born around 1851), blacksmith, presented as the \"great grandson of a happy young Midshipman of the Bounty\" (that would be [[Ned Young|Edward \"Ned\" Young]]).\n* Edward Christian, approx. 55\u201360 years old (judging by appearance), stonecutter, presumably another descendant of Fletcher Christian.\n* \"Pastor Christian\", pastor and mayor of the island. Most likely he is to be identified as [[Edgar Allen Christian]] (at that time 52 years old, an age corresponding to his appearance in the video). Furthermore, this assumption is based on the fact that he (as seen later in the footage) appears to have signed a marriage announcement in his function of being the \"Magistrate\" of the island (see below). In earlier and later years, however, Edgar A. Christian's cousin [[Charles Richard Parkin Christian]] too held this double office of being both the religious leader as well as the Chief Magistrate of Pitcairn (cf. [[List of rulers of the Pitcairn Islands]]).<ref>[http://www.stamps.gov.pn/ParkinChristian.html''Prominent Pitcairners - Part I: Parkin Christian''], accessed on 14 December 2014</ref>\n* (Aunt) Annie McCoy, 70\u201380 years old (judging by appearance), descendant of Able Seaman [[William McCoy (mutineer)|William McCoy]].\n* Rebecca Young, approx. 12\u201320 years old (judging by appearance), presumably another descendant of Midshipman Ned Young.\n* Allan Christian and Eva Christian, a couple (of likely young age?) whose intention of marriage is officially signed and publicly announced by \"Edgar Christian - Magistrate\" (during the time of shooting the documentary).\n* David Young, a newborn baby (who nearly died because the doctor came by ship from abroad and almost arrived too late), yet another descendant of Midshipman Ned Young.\n\nOn top of those, three more people are mentioned in the MGM documentary: Andrew Warren (grandson of a whaler who came to Pitcairn around 1875, thus being no descendant of the mutineers), as well as Dora Warren and Roy Clark, whose exact direct descent from the mutineers (or lack of such) remains unclear, when judging only from the information that the documentary reveals.\n\nA 1962 documentary, ''Pitcairn People'' (directed by [[Peter Newington]], narrated by [[Patrick Wymark]]), was produced by the [[British Petroleum Company]]. It featured many of the island residents of that time. Another documentary, ''Miracle on Pitcairn Island'', was produced in the 1960s by the [[General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists]] (filmed and written by Eric Were, narrated by Neal C. Wilson). It featured many of the same residents.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Mutiny on the Bounty}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Bounty descendants}}\n[[Category:Australia history-related lists]]\n[[Category:French Polynesia-related lists]]\n[[Category:History of Norfolk Island]]\n[[Category:Mutiny on the Bounty|Descendants]]\n[[Category:People from Norfolk Island]]\n[[Category:People of French Polynesian descent]]\n[[Category:Pitcairn Islands people]]\n[[Category:Pitcairn Islands people of British descent]]\n[[Category:Pitcairn Islands people of Polynesian descent]]\n[[Category:HMS Bounty mutineers|Descendants]]\n[[Category:People of Pitcairn Islands descent]]\n", "name_user": "Place Clichy", "label": "safe", "comment": "- 4 categories usingHotCat: these categories are for individual people, not generic articles about groups of people.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descendants_of_the_Bounty_mutineers"}
