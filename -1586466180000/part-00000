The first tramway in Nantes opened in 1879 and closed in 1958 due to bombing damage during [[World War II]], while the present tramway was re-introduced to the city in 1985.\n\nThe first tramway in Nantes was notable for its use of [[compressed air]] propulsion pioneering this technology. In the 1980s, Nantes became the first city in [[Europe]] to re-introduce the present tramway which is notable as the first modern 'new generation' tramway to be built, reversing the trend of tramway closures that had been going on since the middle of the 20th century and becoming the first in a wave of tramways built from scratch in [[France]] and the rest of Europe.\n\nThe current Nantes tramway network consists of three lines, is {{convert|43|km|mi|adj=on}} and serves 83 stations. It is operated by [[Semitan]] (commercially known as TAN), the operator of Nantes public transport network.\n\n==History==\n\n===Compressed air trams (1879-1917)===\n[[File:Tram Nantes AMTUIR.jpg|thumb|Preserved Nantes compressed air tramcar at the AMTUIR museum]]\nThe history of the tramway in Nantes began on 13 December 1879 with the opening of the first line. Service was provided using [[standard gauge]] tramcars propelled by compressed air, using the [[Mekarski system]]. The cars stored the compressed air in steel cylinders, and were periodically topped up with air and steam (used to heat the compressed air) at a pair of recharging stations. The later Nantes cars operated at {{convert|840|psi|abbr=on}}.<ref name=cap>{{cite web | title = Compressed-Air Propulsion | url = http://www.aqpl43.dsl.pipex.com/MUSEUM/TRANSPORT/comprair/comprair.htm | publisher = The Museum of RetroTechnology | accessdate = 2008-08-27 }}</ref><ref name=tictn>{{cite web | title = Compressed Air Trams | first = John | last = Prentice | url = http://tramwayinfo.com/tramways/Articles/Compair2.htm\n | publisher = John R. Prentice | accessdate = 2008-08-27 }}</ref>\n\nThe first line constructed was just over {{convert|6|km|abbr=on}} long and was a mostly level route operating east\u2013west along the quays of the [[Loire|River Loire]]. The initial fleet comprised 22 trams, 2 locomotives and four open top trailers. A second line, running north\u2013south and crossing both the original line and the River Loire was opened in 1888.<ref name=\"tictn\"/>\n\nFurther extensions, together with a third line along the banks of the [[Erdre|River Erdre]], brought the length of the system to {{convert|39|km|abbr=on}} by 1910. By then the fleet had grown to 94 trams, 3 locomotives and 10 open top trailers, and was carrying 12 million passengers per year. By this stage compressed air trams were seen as old-fashioned, and it was decided to electrify the system. Replacement began in 1913, and the last compressed air tram ran in 1917.<ref name=\"tictn\"/>\n\nNantes compressed air tramcar 22, later renumbered 18 and dating from 1879, still exists and is the only surviving compressed air tram in the world. It is part of the collection at the [[Mus\u00e9e des transports urbains, interurbains et ruraux|AMTUIR museum]] in [[Paris]], but was in Nantes in 1992.<ref name=\"tictn\"/><ref name=amt18>{{cite web | url = http://amtuir.org/01_musee/collection/fiches_tv_tm/fiche_nantes_tramway_mekarski_22.htm | title = Nantes - Tramway - Automotrice M\u00e9karski \u00e0 air comprim\u00e9 n\u00b0 22 (1879) | publisher = AMTUIR | date = 2007-10-04 | accessdate = 2008-08-27 | language = French }}</ref>\n\n===Electric trams (1911-1958)===\n[[File:Mus\u00e9e de Nantes - Tramway LU.JPG|thumb|A model of a Nantes electric tram set in the [[Nantes History Museum]]]]\nIn 1911 the intention to electrify the network was announced by the mayor, Paul Bellamy, but work did not start until just before the outbreak of [[World War I]]. By 1915, 8 lines were in service, and work was not completed until the end of 1919. The company standardized its fleet of 100 tramcars, all on Brill trucks with vestibuled platforms. Further extensions were opened, and by 1932 there were 20 lines serving 14 routes. The network was centered at Place du Commerce, which is still today the center of Nantes's tramway network.\n\nDuring [[World War II]], the network was heavily damaged by continued bombing, and several lines were immediately converted to bus operation due to the prohibitive cost of repairs. After the war, tram was seen as being obsolete, noisy and uncomfortable. The decision to replace all tram services by buses was made in 1949, with the last tram running in 1958.\n\n===Modern network (1985-present)===\n[[File:Tramway alsthom.jpg|thumb|TFS tramcar of the type that reopened the Nantes tram system]]\nBy the end of the 1970s, transport in Nantes was heavily biased to the [[Automobile|motor car]]. In an attempt to relieve congestion, the construction of a [[Highway]] along the quays of the [[Erdre|River Edre]] was proposed. The destruction of the urban fabric this would have caused resulted in an outcry and the proposal was rejected. Various public transport solutions were investigated, including improved [[bus]] or [[trolleybus]] services (rejected as having too limited a capacity), and a [[Rapid transit|metro]] (rejected as too expensive). Finally a tramway was proposed.<ref name=tutne>{{cite news | first = C.J. | last = Wansbeek | title = Nantes expansion | work = [[Tramways & Urban Transit]] | publisher = Ian Allan Ltd / Light Rail Transit Association | url = http://www.lrta.org/mag/articles/art0101.html | date = January 2001 | accessdate = 2008-08-27 }}</ref>\n\nAt this point in time, the idea of constructing a new tramway was revolutionary. The trend throughout the world had been to close existing tramways rather than open new ones, and only three relatively small tram systems remained in France (the [[Tramway de Lille|Lille]], [[Tramway de Marseille|Marseille]] and [[Tramway de Saint-\u00c9tienne|Saint-\u00c9tienne]] systems). In [[North America]] the very beginning of a light rail renaissance was just starting to be seen, with the [[Edmonton Light Rail Transit]] system opening in 1978, followed by the [[C-Train|Calgary C-Train]] and [[San Diego Trolley]] systems in 1981. No significant new tramway system had been built in [[Europe]] in many years.<ref name=\"tutne\"/><ref name=trmip>{{cite news | first = David | last = Haydock | title = France's tramway boom | work = Today's Railways | publisher = Platform 5 Publishing Ltd | pages = 20\u201327 | date = April 2006 }}</ref>\n\nAgainst this background, Nantes's municipal council gathered a team of engineers to discuss the possibility of building a new tramway system. The project was set up on 10 February 1981 and financial details sorted. The government accepted financing 30% of the construction. [[Alstom]] was chosen for the construction of twenty tramcars.\n\nThe tramway was finally re-opened in January 1985, with a single line connecting Place du Commerce with Haluch\u00e8re in the north-east of the city. A month later the section from Place du Commerce to Bellevue in the west opened, resulting in a {{convert|10.4|km|abbr=on}} line that had 22 stations. This line, the core of the current line 1, was an immediate success and carried 42,000 passengers daily by the end of the first year. Line 1 was extended by {{convert|2.2|km|abbr=on}} and two stations from Haluch\u00e8re to Beaujoire were added in April 1989.<ref name=\"trmip\"/>\n\nThe success of line 1 led to the decision to construct the north\u2013south line 2, which connects with line 1 at Place du Commerce. Line 2 opened from a southern terminus at Trocadi\u00e8re to 50 Otages, just north of the city center, in September 1992. Subsequent northward extensions reached Orvault Grand Val two years later. The first section of line 3 opened in August 2000. This shared tracks with line 2 from its southern terminus at Hotel Dieu, south of Place du Commerce, to a point just north of Commerce station, from where it ran on its own tracks to Longchamp in the north-west of the city.<ref name=\"trmip\"/>\n\nAn extension at the western section of line 1 took it to Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand in August 2000 adding several new stations through a new extension, transforming Bellevue station into a major transport hub and link it in continuity to the new terminus and leaving the old Rommanet and Jamet stations abandoned (although Jamet station has been reopened a few years later now at the end of a branch, and old Rommanet has been destroyed whereas platforms and tracks have been kept, and the new station was rebuilt a few meters away on the extension). In April 2004, line 3 was extended from Longchamp to Sillon de Bretagne. In August 2005, line 2 was extended {{convert|2.2|km|abbr=on}} and three stations from Trocadi\u00e8re to Neustrie. In September 2007, a short stub and terminus was constructed off line 2 at Pont Rousseau, and line 2 cut back from Neustrie to there. In compensation, line 3 was extended from Hotel Dieu to Neustrie.<ref name=\"trmip\"/><ref name=\"fig2007\">{{cite web | url=http://www.tan.fr/servlet/com.univ.utils.LectureFichierJoint?CODE=1210688510071&LANGUE=0 | title=Key Figures 2007 | publisher=Semitan | accessdate=5 September 2016 | format=pdf | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081203072602/http://www.tan.fr/servlet/com.univ.utils.LectureFichierJoint?CODE=1210688510071&LANGUE=0 | archivedate=3 December 2008 | url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn January 2009, line 3 was extended some {{convert|600|m}} from Sillon de Bretagne to the pre-existing bus depot of Marcel Paul, which was converted to also accommodate trams. A new terminal stop, also known as Marcel Paul, was created adjacent to the depot. In October 2012, a new {{convert|800|m}} branch was created at the eastern end of line 1, running to a terminus at Ranzay, as part of the first phase of the project to make a connection between lines 1 and 2. The same day, the first of the twelve new [[Urbos]] trams, ordered in 2010, was commissioned.<ref name=becl1e>{{cite web | url = http://www.busetcar.com/actualites/actualites_detail.php?action=detail&val=58560&label_donnee=Nantes+fait+le+plein+de+nouveaut%C3%A9s+sur+la+ligne+une+de+son+tramway | title = Nantes fait le plein de nouveaut\u00e9s sur la ligne une de son tramway | language = French | trans-title = Nantes is full of news on line 1 of the tramway | author = Shahinez Benabed | date = 2 October 2012 | accessdate = 8 September 2015 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://archive.is/20130628204609/http://www.busetcar.com/actualites/actualites_detail.php?action=detail&val=58560&label_donnee=Nantes+fait+le+plein+de+nouveaut%C3%A9s+sur+la+ligne+une+de+son+tramway | archivedate = 28 June 2013 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n==Lines==\nThe network is now 44 kilometers long and has 83 stations.

Originally running between Bellevue (today Mendes France Bellevue) and Haluch\u00e8re (today Haluch\u00e8re - Batignolles) and entirely built on [[reserved track]], following the trackbed of a line of the former tramway network. Line 1 serves the [[Stade de la Beaujoire]] along with Parc Des Expositions De La Beaujoire (the city's biggest exhibition center), the main [[Gare de Nantes|railway station of Nantes]], the city's main and largest public library and the region's and Nantes's largest shopping mall Atlantis Le Centre along with Nantes's Zenith in the suburb of [[Saint-Herblain]].\n\nThe line is normally operated with two overlapping alternate services, with one running between Beaujoire and Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand, and the other between Ranzay and Jamet. With 28.7 million journeys made in 2011, line 1 is the busiest line on the network as it serves the very heart of the city as well as major facilities of the city and is one of the busiest Tramway lines in [[France]] and [[Europe]]. Line 1 is also prone to saturations all year round especially at peak times and on weekends.\n\n===Line 2 (Gare de Pont Rousseau - Orvault Grand Val)===\nLine 2 transported 19.1 million passengers in 2011 making it the second most used Tramway line in [[Nantes]] and one of the busiest in France. As with line 1, line 2 at rush hours is subject to saturation as it serves the campus of the [[University of Nantes]] at Petit Port, Nantes's hippodrome and main sports facilities, and H\u00f4tel-Dieu Nantes's main and largest hospital. In September 2007, Line 2 changed its course on its southern part, giving some of its former tracks to line 3 and having a new southern terminus westward, now located at Pont-Rousseau in [[Rez\u00e9]] adjacent to [[Gare de Rez\u00e9-Pont-Rousseau|Rez\u00e9-Pont-Rousseau railway station]].\n\n===Line 3 (Neustrie - Marcel Paul)===\n[[File:Flickr - IngolfBLN - Nantes - Tramway - Ligne 3 - Orvault (17).jpg|thumbnail|Green spaces along the tracks]]\nLine 3 began operation in August 2000 and was extended in 2007. Line 3 now also runs on the former southern tracks of line 2, towards its terminus at [[Neustrie]], an important transport hub near [[Nantes Atlantique Airport]] and [[Airbus]] facilities. A shuttle bus links the short distance between the airport and Neustrie giving an alternative to the \"Navette A\u00e9roport\" linking downtown Nantes and [[Nantes Atlantique Airport]]. In 2011, 18.7 million journeys were made on the line making line 3 the third most used line on the network. It also serves as line 2 H\u00f4tel Dieu, Nantes's main and largest hospital, [[Tour Bretagne]] and the Route de Vannes, a large [[superstore]] driving area spreading along several kilometers, coupled with a shopping mall and a [[hypermarket]].\n\n===Network expansion===\nA connection between lines 1 and 2 is due to open in 2013{{Update after|2013|12|31|reason=is this still planned, doesn't seem to have happened by mid-2015}} on the northern part of the network.

TFS stands for ''Tramway Fran\u00e7ais Standard'', and the intention was that this design would become the standard for subsequent [[France|French]] tramway systems. However, in the end the design was significantly revised for the [[Tramway de Grenoble|Grenoble tram system]], the second system to open, introducing the low-floor TFS-2 variant. Consequently, only Nantes has ever operated the TFS-1 variant.<ref name=\"tutne\"/>\n\nAs built, the TFS-1 were double-ended, single-articulated 6-axle tramcars with a high floor and steep stepped access from low level boarding platforms. All the tramcars built in this form have since been rebuilt with an added low-floor center section, thus becoming 8-axle double-articulated cars with a length of {{convert|38|m|abbr=on}}. Nantes subsequently bought further TFS-1 trams in this 8-axle configuration. Nantes now has 46 of these trams, built in 4 tranches from 1985 to 1994.<ref name=\"tutne\"/><ref name=\"fig2007\"/>\n\nCharacteristics:\n* Number of trams: 46\n* Length: 39.15 m\n* Width: 2.30 m\n* Height: 3.25 m\n* Weight: 51.96 t\n* Capacity: 353 (58 seating, 285 standing)\n* Bogies: 4\n* Access: 2\u00d76 double sliding doors + 2\u00d71 single sliding doors\n* Air conditioned: non equipped\n\n===Adtranz Incentro===\n[[File:Tram-de-Nantes.jpg|thumb|Incentro tramcar; note the low floor throughout.]]\nUnlike most other French tramways, Nantes decided not to use Alstom's successor to the TFS tramcar, the [[Citadis]]. Instead, in 1997, Nantes became the first city to order a fleet of trams from German manufacturer [[Adtranz]] (now [[Bombardier Transportation]]) to the [[Incentro]] design. This modular design is made up of cab, powered and suspended sections, and is 100% low-floor. The trams built for Nantes are air-conditioned, double-ended and consist of five sections, with a length of {{convert|36.4|m|abbr=on}}. Nantes now has 33 of these trams,<ref name=\"tutne\"/><ref name=\"fig2007\"/> which are similar to the fifteen [[AT6/5]] trams found on the [[Nottingham Express Transit]].\n\nCharacteristics:\n* Number of trams: 33\n* Length: 36.42 m\n* Width: 2.40 m\n* Height: 3.28 m\n* Weight: 38.7 t\n* Floor height: 350&nbsp;mm\n* Maximum speed: 80&nbsp;km/h\n* Capacity: 322 (72 seating, 250 standing)\n* Bogies: 3\n* Wheel diameter: 660&nbsp;mm\n* Access: 2\u00d76 double sliding doors\n* Air conditioned: equipped\n\n===CAF Urbos 3===\n[[File:Tramway (CAF) de Nantes, 3eme g\u00e9n\u00e9ration.JPG|thumbnail|CAF Urbos 3 low floored tramcar]]\nIn 2010, [[Nantes M\u00e9tropole]] selected the [[Urbos|Urbos 3]] design from Spanish manufacturer [[Construcciones y Auxiliar de Ferrocarriles|CAF]] to relieve overcrowded trams and assure commercial operation of the extension interconnecting the lines 1 and 2. The order comprised a firm order for eight trams at a cost of \u20ac22&nbsp;million, together with an option on four additional trams at an additional cost of \u20ac10&nbsp;million. The [[Urbos|Urbos 3]] is esthetically and technically very similar to the Incentro trams, and is also 100% low-floored and is air-conditioned. The Urbos 3 started running from autumn 2012.<ref name=becl1e/>\n\nCharacteristics:\n* Number of trams: 8 + 4\n* Length: 37 m\n* Capacity: 249\n* Access: 2 X 6 double sliding doors\n* Air conditioned: equipped\n\n==Operation==\nThe network is operated by [[Semitan]], known as ''TAN'' for short. Semitan is responsible for the whole public transport network throughout the [[Nantes Metropole]] (Greater Nantes), and the Metropole has a majority shareholding in the company.<ref name=\"tutne\"/><ref name=\"fig2007\"/>\n\nThe transport group [[Transdev]], which is also involved in the operation of several other tram systems, including the [[Tramway de Grenoble|Grenoble]], [[Tramway de Montpellier|Montpellier]], [[Nottingham Express Transit|Nottingham]] and [[Tramways in Strasbourg|Strasbourg]] systems, has a minority shareholding in [[Semitan]]. This allows some exchange of information and assistance between these systems. As an example, the tram drivers for Montpellier were trained in Nantes.<ref name=\"tutne\"/><ref name=\"fig2007\"/>\n\n===Station equipment===\n[[File:Plaisance.jpg|thumbnail|Plaisance station on Line 3]]\nAll stations have realtime passenger information LED displays showing realtime estimated passage of the next tram, large round clocks, speakers only used for special announcements, automatic ticket machines which sell a wide range, seating and shelters. Some major stations have staffed ticket offices and connect with other modes of transport such as Nantes buses and Lila buses.\n\n===Hours of operation===\nNantes's Tramways do not run 24 hours a day. Service on the network starts at 4am and runs to 1am on weekdays and Sundays, and from 4am to 3am on Saturdays. Delays occur occasionally, mainly due to demonstrators or minor incidents, and maintenance work on the network is done mostly during summers.\n\n==Fares==\nThe [[Semitan|TAN]] network in Nantes uses paper tickets and passes, though in the near future contactless smartcards will replace them. There are no travel zones on the network in Greater Nantes. Tickets and passes allow free transfer and are universally valid on the Tramway, [[Nantes Busway|Busway]], Nantes [[bus]]es, [[Navibus]], and [[Commuter rail|suburban trains]] within Nantes M\u00e9tropole.\nTickets are not sold inside the trams, but ticket machines (which accept cash and credit cards) are present at every Tramway and Busway station. Tickets must be validated inside the trams when boarding. There are also some staffed ticket offices opened for limited periods only.\n\n===Single trip and day tickets===\n[[Semitan]] issues singles trip tickets (Ticket 1 h) valid for one hour, a 10x saver ticket booklet (Carnet de 10 tickets 1h) valid one hour each, a discounted 10x saver ticket booklet (Carnet de 10 tickets 1h - Tarif r\u00e9duit) valid one hour each, an airport transit ticket (Ticket navette a\u00e9roport), a 24-hour ticket (Ticket 24h) valid an entire day for one traveller and a 24-hour ticket valid an entire day for up to four persons (Ticket 24h/4 personnes).\n\nSemitan also sells Lila and M\u00e9troc\u00e9ane tickets.\n\nLila: Single trip tickets (Ticket unit\u00e9 Lila) valid two hours on the Lila network (departmental buses in [[Loire-Atlantique]]) and one hour on the [[Semitan|TAN]] or STRAN ([[Saint-Nazaire]] buses) networks when transiting from Lila, a 10x saver ticket booklet (Carnet de 10 tickets Lila) valid two hours each on the Lila network and one hour on the TAN or STRAN networks when transiting from Lila.\n\n===Monthly and annual passes===\nSemitan issues a wide range of monthly and annual passes for different categories of travellers depending of their age and working conditions. Free transportation is granted to travellers with low revenues.\n\nSemitan also sells monthly, termly and annual Lila, M\u00e9troc\u00e9ane and Pratik+ passes, for several categories of persons depending of their age and working conditions.\n\n==Traffic==\nIn 2012, 69.2 million journeys were made on the tramway system, where a journey is defined as a single boarding on a single vehicle.

The first tramway in Nantes opened in 1879 and closed in 1958 due to bombing damage during [[World War II]], while the present tramway was re-introduced to the city in 1985.\n\nThe first tramway in Nantes was notable for its use of [[compressed air]] propulsion pioneering this technology. In the 1980s, Nantes became the first city in [[Europe]] to re-introduce the present tramway which is notable as the first modern 'new generation' tramway to be built, reversing the trend of tramway closures that had been going on since the middle of the 20th century and becoming the first in a wave of tramways built from scratch in [[France]] and the rest of Europe.\n\nThe current Nantes tramway network consists of three lines, is {{convert|43|km|mi|adj=on}} and serves 83 stations. It is operated by [[Semitan]] (commercially known as TAN), the operator of Nantes public transport network.\n\n==History==\n\n===Compressed air trams (1879-1917)===\n[[File:Tram Nantes AMTUIR.jpg|thumb|Preserved Nantes compressed air tramcar at the AMTUIR museum]]\nThe history of the tramway in Nantes began on 13 December 1879 with the opening of the first line. Service was provided using [[standard gauge]] tramcars propelled by compressed air, using the [[Mekarski system]]. The cars stored the compressed air in steel cylinders, and were periodically topped up with air and steam (used to heat the compressed air) at a pair of recharging stations. The later Nantes cars operated at {{convert|840|psi|abbr=on}}.<ref name=cap>{{cite web | title = Compressed-Air Propulsion | url = http://www.aqpl43.dsl.pipex.com/MUSEUM/TRANSPORT/comprair/comprair.htm | publisher = The Museum of RetroTechnology | accessdate = 2008-08-27 }}</ref><ref name=tictn>{{cite web | title = Compressed Air Trams | first = John | last = Prentice | url = http://tramwayinfo.com/tramways/Articles/Compair2.htm\n | publisher = John R. Prentice | accessdate = 2008-08-27 }}</ref>\n\nThe first line constructed was just over {{convert|6|km|abbr=on}} long and was a mostly level route operating east-west along the quays of the [[Loire|River Loire]]. The initial fleet comprised 22 trams, 2 locomotives and four open top trailers. A second line, running north-south and crossing both the original line and the River Loire was opened in 1888.<ref name=\"tictn\"/>\n\nFurther extensions, together with a third line along the banks of the [[Erdre|River Erdre]], brought the length of the system to {{convert|39|km|abbr=on}} by 1910. By then the fleet had grown to 94 trams, 3 locomotives and 10 open top trailers, and was carrying 12 million passengers per year. By this stage compressed air trams were seen as old-fashioned, and it was decided to electrify the system. Replacement began in 1913, and the last compressed air tram ran in 1917.<ref name=\"tictn\"/>\n\nNantes compressed air tramcar 22, later renumbered 18 and dating from 1879, still exists and is the only surviving compressed air tram in the world. It is part of the collection at the [[Mus\u00e9e des transports urbains, interurbains et ruraux|AMTUIR museum]] in [[Paris]], but was in Nantes in 1992.<ref name=\"tictn\"/><ref name=amt18>{{cite web | url = http://amtuir.org/01_musee/collection/fiches_tv_tm/fiche_nantes_tramway_mekarski_22.htm | title = Nantes - Tramway - Automotrice M\u00e9karski \u00e0 air comprim\u00e9 n\u00b0 22 (1879) | publisher = AMTUIR | date = 2007-10-04 | accessdate = 2008-08-27 | language = French }}</ref>\n\n===Electric trams (1911-1958)===\n[[File:Mus\u00e9e de Nantes - Tramway LU.JPG|thumb|A model of a Nantes electric tram set in the [[Nantes History Museum]]]]\nIn 1911 the intention to electrify the network was announced by the mayor, Paul Bellamy, but work did not start until just before the outbreak of [[World War I]]. By 1915, 8 lines were in service, and work was not completed until the end of 1919. The company standardized its fleet of 100 tramcars, all on Brill trucks with vestibuled platforms. Further extensions were opened, and by 1932 there were 20 lines serving 14 routes. The network was centered at Place du Commerce, which is still today the center of Nantes's tramway network.\n\nDuring [[World War II]], the network was heavily damaged by continued bombing, and several lines were immediately converted to bus operation due to the prohibitive cost of repairs. After the war, tram was seen as being obsolete, noisy and uncomfortable. The decision to replace all tram services by buses was made in 1949, with the last tram running in 1958.\n\n===Modern network (1985-present)===\n[[File:Tramway alsthom.jpg|thumb|TFS tramcar of the type that reopened the Nantes tram system]]\nBy the end of the 1970s, transport in Nantes was heavily biased to the [[Automobile|motor car]]. In an attempt to relieve congestion, the construction of a [[Highway]] along the quays of the [[Erdre|River Edre]] was proposed. The destruction of the urban fabric this would have caused resulted in an outcry and the proposal was rejected. Various public transport solutions were investigated, including improved [[bus]] or [[trolleybus]] services (rejected as having too limited a capacity), and a [[Rapid transit|metro]] (rejected as too expensive). Finally a tramway was proposed.<ref name=tutne>{{cite news | first = C.J. | last = Wansbeek | title = Nantes expansion | work = [[Tramways & Urban Transit]] | publisher = Ian Allan Ltd / Light Rail Transit Association | url = http://www.lrta.org/mag/articles/art0101.html | date = January 2001 | accessdate = 2008-08-27 }}</ref>\n\nAt this point in time, the idea of constructing a new tramway was revolutionary. The trend throughout the world had been to close existing tramways rather than open new ones, and only three relatively small tram systems remained in France (the [[Tramway de Lille|Lille]], [[Tramway de Marseille|Marseille]] and [[Tramway de Saint-\u00c9tienne|Saint-\u00c9tienne]] systems). In [[North America]] the very beginning of a light rail renaissance was just starting to be seen, with the [[Edmonton Light Rail Transit]] system opening in 1978, followed by the [[C-Train|Calgary C-Train]] and [[San Diego Trolley]] systems in 1981. No significant new tramway system had been built in [[Europe]] in many years.<ref name=\"tutne\"/><ref name=trmip>{{cite news | first = David | last = Haydock | title = France's tramway boom | work = Today's Railways | publisher = Platform 5 Publishing Ltd | pages = 20\u201327 | date = April 2006 }}</ref>\n\nAgainst this background, Nantes's municipal council gathered a team of engineers to discuss the possibility of building a new tramway system. The project was set up on 10 February 1981 and financial details sorted. The government accepted financing 30% of the construction. [[Alstom]] was chosen for the construction of twenty tramcars.\n\nThe tramway was finally re-opened in January 1985, with a single line connecting Place du Commerce with Haluch\u00e8re in the north-east of the city. A month later the section from Place du Commerce to Bellevue in the west opened, resulting in a {{convert|10.4|km|abbr=on}} line that had 22 stations. This line, the core of the current line 1, was an immediate success and carried 42,000 passengers daily by the end of the first year. Line 1 was extended by {{convert|2.2|km|abbr=on}} and two stations from Haluch\u00e8re to Beaujoire were added in April 1989.<ref name=\"trmip\"/>\n\nThe success of line 1 led to the decision to construct the north-south line 2, which connects with line 1 at Place du Commerce. Line 2 opened from a southern terminus at Trocadi\u00e8re to 50 Otages, just north of the city center, in September 1992. Subsequent northward extensions reached Orvault Grand Val two years later. The first section of line 3 opened in August 2000. This shared tracks with line 2 from its southern terminus at Hotel Dieu, south of Place du Commerce, to a point just north of Commerce station, from where it ran on its own tracks to Longchamp in the north-west of the city.<ref name=\"trmip\"/>\n\nAn extension at the western section of line 1 took it to Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand in August 2000 adding several new stations through a new extension, transforming Bellevue station into a major transport hub and link it in continuity to the new terminus and leaving the old Rommanet and Jamet stations abandoned (although Jamet station has been reopened a few years later now at the end of a branch, and old Rommanet has been destroyed whereas platforms and tracks have been kept, and the new station was rebuilt a few meters away on the extension). In April 2004, line 3 was extended from Longchamp to Sillon de Bretagne. In August 2005, line 2 was extended {{convert|2.2|km|abbr=on}} and three stations from Trocadi\u00e8re to Neustrie. In September 2007, a short stub and terminus was constructed off line 2 at Pont Rousseau, and line 2 cut back from Neustrie to there. In compensation, line 3 was extended from Hotel Dieu to Neustrie.<ref name=\"trmip\"/><ref name=\"fig2007\">{{cite web | url=http://www.tan.fr/servlet/com.univ.utils.LectureFichierJoint?CODE=1210688510071&LANGUE=0 | title=Key Figures 2007 | publisher=Semitan | accessdate=5 September 2016 | format=pdf | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081203072602/http://www.tan.fr/servlet/com.univ.utils.LectureFichierJoint?CODE=1210688510071&LANGUE=0 | archivedate=3 December 2008 | url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn January 2009, line 3 was extended some {{convert|600|m}} from Sillon de Bretagne to the pre-existing bus depot of Marcel Paul, which was converted to also accommodate trams. A new terminal stop, also known as Marcel Paul, was created adjacent to the depot. In October 2012, a new {{convert|800|m}} branch was created at the eastern end of line 1, running to a terminus at Ranzay, as part of the first phase of the project to make a connection between lines 1 and 2. The same day, the first of the twelve new [[Urbos]] trams, ordered in 2010, was commissioned.<ref name=becl1e>{{cite web | url = http://www.busetcar.com/actualites/actualites_detail.php?action=detail&val=58560&label_donnee=Nantes+fait+le+plein+de+nouveaut%C3%A9s+sur+la+ligne+une+de+son+tramway | title = Nantes fait le plein de nouveaut\u00e9s sur la ligne une de son tramway | language = French | trans-title = Nantes is full of news on line 1 of the tramway | author = Shahinez Benabed | date = 2 October 2012 | accessdate = 8 September 2015 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://archive.is/20130628204609/http://www.busetcar.com/actualites/actualites_detail.php?action=detail&val=58560&label_donnee=Nantes+fait+le+plein+de+nouveaut%C3%A9s+sur+la+ligne+une+de+son+tramway | archivedate = 28 June 2013 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n==Lines==\nThe network is now 44 kilometers long and has 83 stations.

Originally running between Bellevue (today Mendes France Bellevue) and Haluch\u00e8re (today Haluch\u00e8re - Batignolles) and entirely built on [[reserved track]], following the trackbed of a line of the former tramway network. Line 1 serves the [[Stade de la Beaujoire]] along with Parc Des Expositions De La Beaujoire (the city's biggest exhibition center), the main [[Gare de Nantes|railway station of Nantes]], the city's main and largest public library and the region's and Nantes's largest shopping mall Atlantis Le Centre along with Nantes's Zenith in the suburb of [[Saint-Herblain]].\n\nThe line is normally operated with two overlapping alternate services, with one running between Beaujoire and Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand, and the other between Ranzay and Jamet. With 28.7 million journeys made in 2011, line 1 is the busiest line on the network as it serves the very heart of the city as well as major facilities of the city and is one of the busiest Tramway lines in [[France]] and [[Europe]]. Line 1 is also prone to saturations all year round especially at peak times and on weekends.\n\n===Line 2 (Gare de Pont Rousseau - Orvault Grand Val)===\nLine 2 transported 19.1 million passengers in 2011 making it the second most used Tramway line in [[Nantes]] and one of the busiest in France. As with line 1, line 2 at rush hours is subject to saturation as it serves the campus of the [[University of Nantes]] at Petit Port, Nantes's hippodrome and main sports facilities, and H\u00f4tel-Dieu Nantes's main and largest hospital. In September 2007, Line 2 changed its course on its southern part, giving some of its former tracks to line 3 and having a new southern terminus westward, now located at Pont-Rousseau in [[Rez\u00e9]] adjacent to [[Gare de Rez\u00e9-Pont-Rousseau|Rez\u00e9-Pont-Rousseau railway station]].\n\n===Line 3 (Neustrie - Marcel Paul)===\n[[File:Flickr - IngolfBLN - Nantes - Tramway - Ligne 3 - Orvault (17).jpg|thumbnail|Green spaces along the tracks]]\nLine 3 began operation in August 2000 and was extended in 2007. Line 3 now also runs on the former southern tracks of line 2, towards its terminus at [[Neustrie]], an important transport hub near [[Nantes Atlantique Airport]] and [[Airbus]] facilities. A shuttle bus links the short distance between the airport and Neustrie giving an alternative to the \"Navette A\u00e9roport\" linking downtown Nantes and [[Nantes Atlantique Airport]]. In 2011, 18.7 million journeys were made on the line making line 3 the third most used line on the network. It also serves as line 2 H\u00f4tel Dieu, Nantes's main and largest hospital, [[Tour Bretagne]] and the Route de Vannes, a large [[superstore]] driving area spreading along several kilometers, coupled with a shopping mall and a [[hypermarket]].\n\n===Network expansion===\nA connection between lines 1 and 2 is due to open in 2013{{Update after|2013|12|31|reason=is this still planned, doesn't seem to have happened by mid-2015}} on the northern part of the network.

TFS stands for ''Tramway Fran\u00e7ais Standard'', and the intention was that this design would become the standard for subsequent [[France|French]] tramway systems. However, in the end the design was significantly revised for the [[Tramway de Grenoble|Grenoble tram system]], the second system to open, introducing the low-floor TFS-2 variant. Consequently, only Nantes has ever operated the TFS-1 variant.<ref name=\"tutne\"/>\n\nAs built, the TFS-1 were double-ended, single-articulated 6-axle tramcars with a high floor and steep stepped access from low level boarding platforms. All the tramcars built in this form have since been rebuilt with an added low-floor center section, thus becoming 8-axle double-articulated cars with a length of {{convert|38|m|abbr=on}}. Nantes subsequently bought further TFS-1 trams in this 8-axle configuration. Nantes now has 46 of these trams, built in 4 tranches from 1985 to 1994.<ref name=\"tutne\"/><ref name=\"fig2007\"/>\n\nCharacteristics:\n* Number of trams: 46\n* Length: 39.15 m\n* Width: 2.30 m\n* Height: 3.25 m\n* Weight: 51.96 t\n* Capacity: 353 (58 seating, 285 standing)\n* Bogies: 4\n* Access: 2\u00d76 double sliding doors + 2\u00d71 single sliding doors\n* Air conditioned: non equipped\n\n===Adtranz Incentro===\n[[File:Tram-de-Nantes.jpg|thumb|Incentro tramcar; note the low floor throughout.]]\nUnlike most other French tramways, Nantes decided not to use Alstom's successor to the TFS tramcar, the [[Citadis]]. Instead, in 1997, Nantes became the first city to order a fleet of trams from German manufacturer [[Adtranz]] (now [[Bombardier Transportation]]) to the [[Incentro]] design. This modular design is made up of cab, powered and suspended sections, and is 100% low-floor. The trams built for Nantes are air-conditioned, double-ended and consist of five sections, with a length of {{convert|36.4|m|abbr=on}}. Nantes now has 33 of these trams,<ref name=\"tutne\"/><ref name=\"fig2007\"/> which are similar to the fifteen [[AT6/5]] trams found on the [[Nottingham Express Transit]].\n\nCharacteristics:\n* Number of trams: 33\n* Length: 36.42 m\n* Width: 2.40 m\n* Height: 3.28 m\n* Weight: 38.7 t\n* Floor height: 350&nbsp;mm\n* Maximum speed: 80&nbsp;km/h\n* Capacity: 322 (72 seating, 250 standing)\n* Bogies: 3\n* Wheel diameter: 660&nbsp;mm\n* Access: 2\u00d76 double sliding doors\n* Air conditioned: equipped\n\n===CAF Urbos 3===\n[[File:Tramway (CAF) de Nantes, 3eme g\u00e9n\u00e9ration.JPG|thumbnail|CAF Urbos 3 low floored tramcar]]\nIn 2010, [[Nantes M\u00e9tropole]] selected the [[Urbos|Urbos 3]] design from Spanish manufacturer [[Construcciones y Auxiliar de Ferrocarriles|CAF]] to relieve overcrowded trams and assure commercial operation of the extension interconnecting the lines 1 and 2. The order comprised a firm order for eight trams at a cost of \u20ac22&nbsp;million, together with an option on four additional trams at an additional cost of \u20ac10&nbsp;million. The [[Urbos|Urbos 3]] is esthetically and technically very similar to the Incentro trams, and is also 100% low-floored and is air-conditioned. The Urbos 3 started running from autumn 2012.<ref name=becl1e/>\n\nCharacteristics:\n* Number of trams: 8 + 4\n* Length: 37 m\n* Capacity: 249\n* Access: 2 X 6 double sliding doors\n* Air conditioned: equipped\n\n==Operation==\nThe network is operated by [[Semitan]], known as ''TAN'' for short. Semitan is responsible for the whole public transport network throughout the [[Nantes Metropole]] (Greater Nantes), and the Metropole has a majority shareholding in the company.<ref name=\"tutne\"/><ref name=\"fig2007\"/>\n\nThe transport group [[Transdev]], which is also involved in the operation of several other tram systems, including the [[Tramway de Grenoble|Grenoble]], [[Tramway de Montpellier|Montpellier]], [[Nottingham Express Transit|Nottingham]] and [[Tramways in Strasbourg|Strasbourg]] systems, has a minority shareholding in [[Semitan]]. This allows some exchange of information and assistance between these systems. As an example, the tram drivers for Montpellier were trained in Nantes.<ref name=\"tutne\"/><ref name=\"fig2007\"/>\n\n===Station equipment===\n[[File:Plaisance.jpg|thumbnail|Plaisance station on Line 3]]\nAll stations have realtime passenger information LED displays showing realtime estimated passage of the next tram, large round clocks, speakers only used for special announcements, automatic ticket machines which sell a wide range, seating and shelters. Some major stations have staffed ticket offices and connect with other modes of transport such as Nantes buses and Lila buses.\n\n===Hours of operation===\nNantes's Tramways do not run 24 hours a day. Service on the network starts at 4am and runs to 1am on weekdays and Sundays, and from 4am to 3am on Saturdays. Delays occur occasionally, mainly due to demonstrators or minor incidents, and maintenance work on the network is done mostly during summers.\n\n==Fares==\nThe [[Semitan|TAN]] network in Nantes uses paper tickets and passes, though in the near future contactless smartcards will replace them. There are no travel zones on the network in Greater Nantes. Tickets and passes allow free transfer and are universally valid on the Tramway, [[Nantes Busway|Busway]], Nantes [[bus]]es, [[Navibus]], and [[Commuter rail|suburban trains]] within Nantes M\u00e9tropole.\nTickets are not sold inside the trams, but ticket machines (which accept cash and credit cards) are present at every Tramway and Busway station. Tickets must be validated inside the trams when boarding. There are also some staffed ticket offices opened for limited periods only.\n\n===Single trip and day tickets===\n[[Semitan]] issues singles trip tickets (Ticket 1 h) valid for one hour, a 10x saver ticket booklet (Carnet de 10 tickets 1h) valid one hour each, a discounted 10x saver ticket booklet (Carnet de 10 tickets 1h - Tarif r\u00e9duit) valid one hour each, an airport transit ticket (Ticket navette a\u00e9roport), a 24-hour ticket (Ticket 24h) valid an entire day for one traveller and a 24-hour ticket valid an entire day for up to four persons (Ticket 24h/4 personnes).\n\nSemitan also sells Lila and M\u00e9troc\u00e9ane tickets.\n\nLila: Single trip tickets (Ticket unit\u00e9 Lila) valid two hours on the Lila network (departmental buses in [[Loire-Atlantique]]) and one hour on the [[Semitan|TAN]] or STRAN ([[Saint-Nazaire]] buses) networks when transiting from Lila, a 10x saver ticket booklet (Carnet de 10 tickets Lila) valid two hours each on the Lila network and one hour on the TAN or STRAN networks when transiting from Lila.\n\n===Monthly and annual passes===\nSemitan issues a wide range of monthly and annual passes for different categories of travellers depending of their age and working conditions.

Centered around guitarist/lead vocalist [[Doug Martsch]], the only permanent member, Built to Spill has has released eight full-length albums since its incarnation. \n\n==History==\nFormer [[Treepeople]] guitarist/vocalist [[Doug Martsch]] formed Built to Spill in 1992 with [[Brett Netson]] and [[Ralf Youtz]] as the band's original members. In an interview with [[Spin (magazine)|''Spin'']], Martsch stated that he intended to change the band's lineup for every album, himself being the only permanent member.  After the band's first album, ''[[Ultimate Alternative Wavers]]'', was released in 1993, Netson and Youtz were replaced by [[Brett Nelson]] and Andy Capps for 1994's ''[[There's Nothing Wrong with Love]]''.  A [[compilation album]] called ''[[The Normal Years]]'' followed, which included recordings by both lineups. ''[[Built to Spill Caustic Resin]]'', an EP that features Martsch with the members of [[Caustic Resin]], was released in 1995. Between recording albums in 1995, the band gained exposure by playing on the [[Lollapalooza]] tour. Also in 1995, the band collaborated on the song \"Still Flat\" for the AIDS benefit album ''[[Red Hot + Bothered]]'', produced by the [[Red Hot Organization]].\n\nMartsch signed Built to Spill to [[Warner Bros. Records]] in 1995. Unlike many artists signed to major labels, the deal the band brokered with Warner Bros. allowed it to retain a large degree of creative control over future albums. Built to Spill produced its first major label release in 1997 with ''[[Perfect from Now On]]''. By this time, the band consisted of Martsch, Nelson, Netson, and Scott Plouf. ''Perfect from Now On'' was met with critical success and caused Built to Spill to become one of the United States' most recognizable indie rock bands. Before releasing another album, Martsch made Nelson and Plouf permanent members of the band. In 1999, the band released ''[[Keep It Like a Secret]]'' to continued critical success and for the first time, significant commercial success. ''[[Built to Spill Live|Live]]'' was released in 2000, and the band's fifth studio album, ''[[Ancient Melodies of the Future]]'', was released in 2001.\n\nIn 2002, Martsch released ''[[Now You Know (Doug Martsch album)|Now You Know]]'', a solo album with both [[blues]] and [[folk music|folk]] elements.  He performed numerous solo concerts in support of the album. Built to Spill was on hiatus for most of this period.\n[[Image:Built2spill.jpg|thumb|left|[[Doug Martsch]] performing with the band at [[Primavera Sound Festival]].]]\nWarner Bros.

The band has released eight full-length albums. Their most recent, ''[[Untethered Moon]]'', was released on April 21, 2015.\n\n==History==\nFormer [[Treepeople]] guitarist/vocalist [[Doug Martsch]] formed Built to Spill in 1992 with [[Brett Netson]] and [[Ralf Youtz]] as the band's original members. In an interview with [[Spin (magazine)|''Spin'']], Martsch stated that he intended to change the band's lineup for every album, himself being the only permanent member.  After the band's first album, ''[[Ultimate Alternative Wavers]]'', was released in 1993, Netson and Youtz were replaced by [[Brett Nelson]] and Andy Capps for 1994's ''[[There's Nothing Wrong with Love]]''.  A [[compilation album]] called ''[[The Normal Years]]'' followed, which included recordings by both lineups. ''[[Built to Spill Caustic Resin]]'', an EP that features Martsch with the members of [[Caustic Resin]], was released in 1995. Between recording albums in 1995, the band gained exposure by playing on the [[Lollapalooza]] tour. Also in 1995, the band collaborated on the song \"Still Flat\" for the AIDS benefit album ''[[Red Hot + Bothered]]'', produced by the [[Red Hot Organization]].\n\nMartsch signed Built to Spill to [[Warner Bros. Records]] in 1995. Unlike many artists signed to major labels, the deal the band brokered with Warner Bros. allowed it to retain a large degree of creative control over future albums. Built to Spill produced its first major label release in 1997 with ''[[Perfect from Now On]]''. By this time, the band consisted of Martsch, Nelson, Netson, and Scott Plouf. ''Perfect from Now On'' was met with critical success and caused Built to Spill to become one of the United States' most recognizable indie rock bands. Before releasing another album, Martsch made Nelson and Plouf permanent members of the band. In 1999, the band released ''[[Keep It Like a Secret]]'' to continued critical success and for the first time, significant commercial success. ''[[Built to Spill Live|Live]]'' was released in 2000, and the band's fifth studio album, ''[[Ancient Melodies of the Future]]'', was released in 2001.\n\nIn 2002, Martsch released ''[[Now You Know (Doug Martsch album)|Now You Know]]'', a solo album with both [[blues]] and [[folk music|folk]] elements.  He performed numerous solo concerts in support of the album. Built to Spill was on hiatus for most of this period.\n[[Image:Built2spill.jpg|thumb|left|[[Doug Martsch]] performing with the band at [[Primavera Sound Festival]].]]\nWarner Bros.

Schulz]]'s [[comic strip]] ''[[Peanuts]]'', produced by [[Blue Sky Studios]] and distributed by [[20th Century Fox]]. It is the fifth full-length ''Peanuts'' film, and the first in 35 years.<ref name=\"THRReview\" /> The film is directed by [[Steve Martino]] from a screenplay by Craig and Bryan Schulz (Schulz's son and grandson, respectively), and Cornelius Uliano, and stars the voices of [[Noah Schnapp]] as [[Charlie Brown]] and, via archival recordings, [[Bill Melendez]] as [[Snoopy]] and [[Woodstock (Peanuts)|Woodstock]]. The film sees Charlie Brown trying to improve his odds with the [[Little Red-Haired Girl]], while Snoopy writes a book about the [[World War I]] [[Flying Ace]] as he imagines himself as a legend trying to save his love interest and fellow pilot [[Snoopy#Fifi|Fifi]] from the [[Red Baron]] and [[Jagdstaffel 11|his army]].\n\nDevelopment of the film began in 2006, six years after the death of Charles Schulz and the final release of the last ''Peanuts'' comic strip. Craig Schulz, the son of Charles, pitched a film idea to his son, Bryan Schulz. While presenting the film idea, Bryan stated that he had full creative control on the film, so that the quality would remain under Charles' legacy. 20th Century Fox and Blue Sky Studios announced development of a computer-animated film in October 2012, with Steve Martino directing, due to his faithfulness in the film, ''[[Horton Hears a Who! (film)|Horton Hears a Who!]]'', also produced by Blue Sky.<ref name=\"TWPGoodPlan\" /><ref name=\"Charles-Peanuts\" /> Numerous elements from the comic strip were featured in the film, such as Charlie Brown's skating pond, his house, \"the wall\" and Lucy's psychiatrist booth, as well as the Snoopy and Woodstock voice tracks from [[Bill Melendez]].<ref name=\"USATodayRedFifi\" /> The soundtrack was composed by [[Christophe Beck]], with contributions by [[Meghan Trainor]] and [[David Benoit (musician)|David Benoit]], including original tracks from [[Vince Guaraldi]].<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\"MIPMarkets\" />\n\n''The Peanuts Movie'' premiered in [[New York City]] on November 1, 2015,<ref name=\":1\" /> and was released in the United States five days later. It grossed $246 million worldwide against a $99 million budget to become the [[List_of_animated_feature_films_of_2015#Highest-grossing animated films of 2015|7th highest-grossing animated film of 2015]]. The film was met with generally favorable reviews, with praise for the animation and faithfulness towards the source material. It received nominations for the [[Annie Award for Best Animated Feature]], the [[Critics' Choice Movie Award for Best Animated Feature]], and was the first Blue Sky Studios film to be nominated for a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Animated Feature Film]].\n\n==Plot==\nWhen the [[Little Red-Haired Girl]] moves into his neighborhood, [[Charlie Brown]] becomes infatuated with her, though worries his long-running streak of failures will prevent her from noticing him. After [[Lucy van Pelt|Lucy]] tells him he should try being more confident, Charlie Brown decides to embark upon a series of new activities in hope of finding one that will get the Little Red-Haired Girl to notice him. His first attempt is to participate in the school's talent show with a magic act, helped by [[Snoopy]] and [[Woodstock (Peanuts)|Woodstock]]. However, when [[Sally Brown|Sally]]'s act goes wrong, Charlie Brown sacrifices his time for her, rescues his sister from being humiliated, and is humiliated himself in return. Attempting to impress the Little Red-Haired Girl with his dance skills, Charlie Brown signs up for the school dance and gets Snoopy to teach him all his best moves. At the dance, Charlie Brown attracts praise for his skills, but slips and sets off the sprinkler system, causing the dance to be cut short and all the other students to look down upon him once more.\n\nCharlie Brown is partnered with the Little Red-Haired Girl to write a book report. At first, he is excited to have a chance to be with her, but she is called away for a week to deal with a family illness, leaving Charlie Brown to write the report all by himself. Hoping to impress both the Little Red-Haired Girl and his teacher, Charlie Brown writes his report on the collegiate-level novel ''[[War and Peace]]''. At the same time, Charlie Brown finds he is the only student to get a perfect score on a standardized test. His friends and the other students congratulate him, and his popularity begins to climb. When he goes to accept a medal at a school assembly, however, he learns the test papers are accidentally mixed up and the perfect score actually belongs to [[Peppermint Patty]]; Charlie Brown reveals the mistake and declines the medal, losing all his new-found popularity. His book report is destroyed by a [[Red Baron]] [[Fokker Dr.I|model plane]], and he admits to the Little Red-Haired Girl he has caused them to both fail the assignment.\n\nIn a [[subplot]], after finding a typewriter in the school dumpster, Snoopy writes a novel about the [[World War I]] [[Flying Ace]], trying to save [[Snoopy#Fifi|Fifi]] from the Red Baron with Woodstock and [[List of minor characters in Peanuts#Snoopy's Beagle Scouts|his friends]]' help, using the key events and situations surrounding Charlie Brown as inspiration to develop his story. He acts out his adventure physically, coming across Charlie Brown and the gang several times along the way. Snoopy defeats the Red Baron and rescues Fifi from an airplane. When Lucy finishes reading, she calls it the dumbest story she has ever read, so Snoopy throws the typewriter at her in retaliation and kisses her nose causing her to run away in disgust yelling that she has \"dog germs\".\n\nBefore leaving school for the summer, Charlie Brown is surprised when the Little Red-Haired Girl chooses him for a pen pal. [[Linus van Pelt|Linus]] convinces Charlie Brown he needs to tell the Little Red-Haired Girl how he feels about her before she leaves for the summer. Racing to her house, he discovers she is about to leave on a bus for summer camp. He tries to chase the bus but is prevented from reaching it. Just as he is about to give up, thinking the whole world is against him, Charlie Brown sees a kite fall from the [[Kite-Eating Tree]]. The string becomes entangled around his waist and sails away with him. Amazed to see Charlie Brown flying a kite, his friends follow.\n\nUpon reaching the bus, Charlie Brown finally asks the Little Red-Haired Girl why she has chosen him in spite of his failures. The Little Red-Haired Girl explains she admires his selflessness and his determination and praises him as an honest, caring, and compassionate person. The two promise to write to one another; the other children congratulate him as a true friend and carry him off.\n\nIn a post-credit scene, Snoopy, his family, Fifi, Woodstock and his friends are celebrating victory from the Red Baron. The Red Baron flies by them soon after, causing Snoopy to scream, \"CURSE YOU RED BARON!\"\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Peanuts Gang 2015.png|thumb|The main Peanuts characters as seen in the closing shot of the film (L to R): Franklin, Marcie, Peppermint Patty, Linus, Charlie Brown, Snoopy, Lucy, Woodstock, Sally, Schroeder, and Pig-Pen.]]\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Noah Schnapp]] as [[Charlie Brown]]<ref name=BWCast>{{cite press release|author1=Twentieth Century Fox|title=THE PEANUTS MOVIE Cast Announced|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20141127005023/en/PEANUTS-MOVIE-Cast-Announced|publisher=Business Wire|accessdate=November 27, 2014|date=November 27, 2014}}</ref>\n* Alex Garfin as [[Linus van Pelt|Linus]]<ref name=BWCast />\n* Noah Johnston as [[Schroeder (Peanuts)|Schroeder]]<ref name=BWCast />\n* [[Bill Melendez]] as [[Snoopy]] and [[Woodstock (Peanuts)|Woodstock]] (from archival recordings).<ref name=\"First-Look\">{{cite web|last=Fischer|first=Russ|title=New \u2018Peanuts\u2019 Movie First Look: Charlie Brown and Snoopy Head Back to the Big Screen|url=http://www.slashfilm.com/new-peanuts-movie/|publisher=[[/Film]]|accessdate=March 19, 2014|date=March 17, 2014}}</ref> Woodstock and his bird friends are part of [[List of minor characters in Peanuts#Snoopy's Beagle Scouts|Snoopy's Beagle Scouts]],<ref name=\"OlafBeagleScouts\" /> who serve as the [[World War I]] [[Flying Ace]]'s (Snoopy's) repair crew.\n* Hadley Belle Miller as [[Lucy van Pelt|Lucy]]<ref name=BWCast />\n* Micah Revelli as Little Kid<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.peanutsmovie.com/about/|title=Cast|publisher=Peanuts Movie|accessdate=September 22, 2015}}</ref>\n* Venus Omega Schultheis as [[Peppermint Patty]]<ref name=BWCast />\n* Mariel Sheets as [[Sally Brown|Sally]]<ref name=BWCast />\n* [[Madisyn Shipman]] as [[Violet (Peanuts)|Violet]]<ref name=BWCast />\n* AJ Teece as [[Pig-Pen]]<ref name=BWCast />\n* Marelik \"Mar Mar\" Walker as [[Franklin (Peanuts)|Franklin]]<ref name=BWCast />\n* William \"Alex\" Wunsch as [[Shermy]]<ref name=BWCast />\n* [[Troy \"Trombone Shorty\" Andrews]] as [[List of minor characters in Peanuts#Miss Othmar|Miss Othmar]] and the [[Little Red-Haired Girl]]'s mother.

I have kids who aspire to be something big and great... a star football player or on Broadway.

Schulz]]'s [[comic strip]] ''[[Peanuts]]'', produced by [[Blue Sky Studios]] and distributed by [[20th Century Fox]]. It is the fifth full-length ''Peanuts'' film, and the first in 35 years.<ref name=\"THRReview\" /> The film is directed by [[Steve Martino]] from a screenplay by Craig and Bryan Schulz (Schulz's son and grandson, respectively), and Cornelius Uliano, and stars the voices of [[Noah Schnapp]] as [[Charlie Brown]] and, via archival recordings, [[Bill Melendez]] as [[Snoopy]] and [[Woodstock (Peanuts)|Woodstock]]. The film sees Charlie Brown trying to improve his odds with the [[Little Red-Haired Girl]], while Snoopy writes a book about the [[World War I]] [[Flying Ace]] as he imagines himself as a legend trying to save his love interest and fellow pilot [[Snoopy#Fifi|Fifi]] from the [[Red Baron]] and [[Jagdstaffel 11|his army]].\n\nDevelopment of the film began in 2006, six years after the death of Charles Schulz and the final release of the last ''Peanuts'' comic strip. Craig Schulz, the son of Charles, pitched a film idea to his son, Bryan Schulz. While presenting the film idea, Bryan stated that he had full creative control on the film, so that the quality would remain under Charles' legacy. 20th Century Fox and Blue Sky Studios announced development of a computer-animated film in October 2012, with Steve Martino directing, due to his faithfulness in the film, ''[[Horton Hears a Who! (film)|Horton Hears a Who!]]'', also produced by Blue Sky.<ref name=\"TWPGoodPlan\" /><ref name=\"Charles-Peanuts\" /> Numerous elements from the comic strip were featured in the film, such as Charlie Brown's skating pond, his house, \"the wall\" and Lucy's psychiatrist booth, as well as the Snoopy and Woodstock voice tracks from [[Bill Melendez]].<ref name=\"USATodayRedFifi\" /> The soundtrack was composed by [[Christophe Beck]], with contributions by [[Meghan Trainor]] and [[David Benoit (musician)|David Benoit]], including original tracks from [[Vince Guaraldi]].<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\"MIPMarkets\" />\n\n''The Peanuts Movie'' premiered in [[New York City]] on November 1, 2015,<ref name=\":1\" /> and was released in the United States five days later. It grossed $246 million worldwide against a $99 million budget to become the [[List_of_animated_feature_films_of_2015#Highest-grossing animated films of 2015|7th highest-grossing animated film of 2015]]. The film was met with generally favorable reviews, with praise for the animation and faithfulness towards the source material. It received nominations for the [[Annie Award for Best Animated Feature]], the [[Critics' Choice Movie Award for Best Animated Feature]], and was the first Blue Sky Studios film to be nominated for a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Animated Feature Film]].\n\n==Plot==\nWhen the [[Little Red-Haired Girl]] moves into his neighborhood, [[Charlie Brown]] becomes infatuated with her, though worries his long-running streak of failures will prevent her from noticing him. After [[Lucy van Pelt|Lucy]] tells him he should try being more confident, Charlie Brown decides to embark upon a series of new activities in hope of finding one that will get the Little Red-Haired Girl to notice him. His first attempt is to participate in the school's talent show with a magic act, helped by [[Snoopy]] and [[Woodstock (Peanuts)|Woodstock]]. However, when [[Sally Brown|Sally]]'s act goes wrong, Charlie Brown sacrifices his time for her, rescues his sister from being humiliated, and is humiliated himself in return. Attempting to impress the Little Red-Haired Girl with his dance skills, Charlie Brown signs up for the school dance and gets Snoopy to teach him all his best moves. At the dance, Charlie Brown attracts praise for his skills, but slips and sets off the sprinkler system, causing the dance to be cut short and all the other students to look down upon him once more.\n\nCharlie Brown is partnered with the Little Red-Haired Girl to write a book report. At first, he is excited to have a chance to be with her, but she is called away for a week to deal with a family illness, leaving Charlie Brown to write the report all by himself. Hoping to impress both the Little Red-Haired Girl and his teacher, Charlie Brown writes his report on the collegiate-level novel ''[[War and Peace]]''. At the same time, Charlie Brown finds he is the only student to get a perfect score on a standardized test. His friends and the other students congratulate him, and his popularity begins to climb. When he goes to accept a medal at a school assembly, however, he learns the test papers are accidentally mixed up and the perfect score actually belongs to [[Peppermint Patty]]; Charlie Brown reveals the mistake and declines the medal, losing all his new-found popularity. His book report is destroyed by a [[Red Baron]] [[Fokker Dr.I|model plane]], and he admits to the Little Red-Haired Girl he has caused them to both fail the assignment.\n\nIn a [[subplot]], after finding a typewriter in the school dumpster, Snoopy writes a novel about the [[World War I]] [[Flying Ace]], trying to save [[Snoopy#Fifi|Fifi]] from the Red Baron with Woodstock and [[List of minor characters in Peanuts#Snoopy's Beagle Scouts|his friends]]' help, using the key events and situations surrounding Charlie Brown as inspiration to develop his story. He acts out his adventure physically, coming across Charlie Brown and the gang several times along the way. Snoopy defeats the Red Baron and rescues Fifi from an airplane. When Lucy finishes reading, she calls it the dumbest story she has ever read, so Snoopy throws the typewriter at her in retaliation and kisses her nose causing her to run away in disgust yelling that she has \"dog germs\".\n\nBefore leaving school for the summer, Charlie Brown is surprised when the Little Red-Haired Girl chooses him for a pen pal. [[Linus van Pelt|Linus]] convinces Charlie Brown he needs to tell the Little Red-Haired Girl how he feels about her before she leaves for the summer. Racing to her house, he discovers she is about to leave on a bus for summer camp. He tries to chase the bus but is prevented from reaching it. Just as he is about to give up, thinking the whole world is against him, Charlie Brown sees a kite fall from the [[Kite-Eating Tree]]. The string becomes entangled around his waist and sails away with him. Amazed to see Charlie Brown flying a kite, his friends follow.\n\nUpon reaching the bus, Charlie Brown finally asks the Little Red-Haired Girl why she has chosen him in spite of his failures. The Little Red-Haired Girl explains she admires his selflessness and his determination and praises him as an honest, caring, and compassionate person. The two promise to write to one another; the other children congratulate him as a true friend and carry him off.\n\nIn a post-credit scene, Snoopy, his family, Fifi, Woodstock and his friends are celebrating victory from the Red Baron. The Red Baron flies by them soon after, causing Snoopy to scream, \"CURSE YOU RED BARON!\"\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Peanuts Gang 2015.png|thumb|The main Peanuts characters as seen in the closing shot of the film (L to R): Franklin, Marcie, Peppermint Patty, Linus, Charlie Brown, Snoopy, Lucy, Woodstock, Sally, Schroeder, and Pig-Pen.]]\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Noah Schnapp]] as [[Charlie Brown]]<ref name=BWCast>{{cite press release|author1=Twentieth Century Fox|title=THE PEANUTS MOVIE Cast Announced|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20141127005023/en/PEANUTS-MOVIE-Cast-Announced|publisher=Business Wire|accessdate=November 27, 2014|date=November 27, 2014}}</ref>\n* Alex Garfin as [[Linus van Pelt|Linus]]<ref name=BWCast />\n* Noah Johnston as [[Schroeder (Peanuts)|Schroeder]]<ref name=BWCast />\n* [[Bill Melendez]] as [[Snoopy]] and [[Woodstock (Peanuts)|Woodstock]] (from archival recordings).<ref name=\"First-Look\">{{cite web|last=Fischer|first=Russ|title=New \u2018Peanuts\u2019 Movie First Look: Charlie Brown and Snoopy Head Back to the Big Screen|url=http://www.slashfilm.com/new-peanuts-movie/|publisher=[[/Film]]|accessdate=March 19, 2014|date=March 17, 2014}}</ref> Woodstock and his bird friends are part of [[List of minor characters in Peanuts#Snoopy's Beagle Scouts|Snoopy's Beagle Scouts]],<ref name=\"OlafBeagleScouts\" /> who serve as the [[World War I]] [[Flying Ace]]'s (Snoopy's) repair crew.\n* Hadley Belle Miller as [[Lucy van Pelt|Lucy]]<ref name=BWCast />\n* Micah Revelli as Little Kid<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.peanutsmovie.com/about/|title=Cast|publisher=Peanuts Movie|accessdate=September 22, 2015}}</ref>\n* Venus Omega Schultheis as [[Peppermint Patty]]<ref name=BWCast />\n* Mariel Sheets as [[Sally Brown|Sally]]<ref name=BWCast />\n* [[Madisyn Shipman]] as [[Violet (Peanuts)|Violet]]<ref name=BWCast />\n* AJ Teece as [[Pig-Pen]]<ref name=BWCast />\n* Marelik \"Mar Mar\" Walker as [[Franklin (Peanuts)|Franklin]]<ref name=BWCast />\n* William \"Alex\" Wunsch as [[Shermy]]<ref name=BWCast />\n* [[Troy \"Trombone Shorty\" Andrews]] as [[List of minor characters in Peanuts#Miss Othmar|Miss Othmar]] and the [[Little Red-Haired Girl]]'s mother.

exist for its diagnosis, as of October 2019.<ref name=SiegelJatlaoui2019/> Healthcare providers should evaluate for alternative diagnoses (e.g., cardiac, gastrointestinal, rheumatologic, neoplastic, environmental, or occupational exposures, or causes of [[acute respiratory distress syndrome]]) as suggested by clinical presentation and medical history, while also considering multiple etiologies, including the possibility of VAPI occurring with a concomitant infection.<ref name=SiegelJatlaoui2019/>\n\nAll healthcare providers evaluating patients for VAPI should consider obtaining a thorough patient history, including symptoms and recent use of e-cigarette, or vaping, products, along with substances used, duration and frequency of use, and method of use.<ref name=SiegelJatlaoui2019/> Additionally a detailed physical examination should be performed, specifically including vital signs and pulse-[[oximetry]].<ref name=SiegelJatlaoui2019/> Laboratory testing guided by clinical findings, which may include a respiratory virus panel to rule out infectious diseases, [[complete blood count]] with differential, serum inflammatory markers ([[C-reactive protein]] [CRP], [[erythrocyte sedimentation rate]] [ESR]), liver [[transaminase]]s, and urine toxicology testing, including testing for THC should be acquired.<ref name=SiegelJatlaoui2019/> Imaging, typically a chest [[X-ray]], with consideration for a chest CT if chest X-ray results do not correlate with the clinical picture or to evaluate severe or worsening disease should be obtained.<ref name=SiegelJatlaoui2019/> Consulting with specialists (e.g. critical care, pulmonology, medical toxicology, or infectious disease) can help guide further evaluation.<ref name=SiegelJatlaoui2019/> The diagnosis is commonly suspected when the person does not respond to antibiotic therapy, and testing does not reveal an alternative diagnosis.<ref name=CDPH-2019/> Many of the reported cases involved worsening respiratory failure within 48&nbsp;hours of admission after the administration of empiric antibiotic therapy.<ref name=DavidsonBrancato2019/> Lung biopsies are not necessary for the

The initiatives, which focus on [[Healthy diet|healthy eating]], [[Physical exercise|physical activity]], tobacco reduction, and community capacity building are now underway in over 105 communities across British Columbia.  As they continue to early 2010, BCHLA is continually working closely with [[ActNow BC]] and the [[Ministry of Healthy Living and Sport]] along with many other community partners.\n\nThe Alliance continues its policy work and has developed a discussion paper, ''Healthy Futures for BC Families,'' on the social issues that can impede or enhance the healthy of a society.  These issues include access to: [[affordable housing]], early childhood development and care, income and [[food security]], and supportive environments.\n\n==Background==\nThe Alliance was formed in February 2003 with a mission to lead collaborative actions to promote physical activity, healthy eating, and living smoke-free in order to improve the overall health of British Columbians.<ref name=\"whoweare\">{{cite web|url= http://www.bchealthyliving.ca/who_we_are|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080419142145/http://www.bchealthyliving.ca/who_we_are|url-status= dead|archive-date= 2008-04-19| title= BCHLA Who We Are| accessdate= 2009-02-26}}</ref>\n\nIn March 2006, the Alliance received \"a one-time grant of $25.2 million to pursue recommendations outlined in their report, \"The Winning Legacy - A plan for improving the health of British Columbians by 2010.\"<ref name=\"minofhealth\">{{cite web|url= http://www.llbc.leg.bc.ca/public/PubDocs/bcdocs/401886/bch_nr_mar_23_2006.pdf| title= Press Release: $30 Million to Promote Healthy Living in B.C.| accessdate= 2009-03-04| publisher= Public Affairs Bureau, Ministry of Health}}</ref>  Health Minister George Abbott had said, \"We are supporting programs that promote healthy living and prevent illness in our society.

Red Fanta was reportedly the preferred drink of the then-King of Thailand [[Bhumibol Adulyadej]]. Glasses and open bottles of red Fanta are often seen as offerings on the small altars displayed in most Thai homes and shops. They supposedly  represent blood offerings in Thai [[animistic]] beliefs.\n* Green Soda (cream soda) - This flavour is not listed on the packaging. It is just called green soda or {{transl|tha|nam quiew}} (\u0e19\u0e49\u0e33\u0e40\u0e02\u0e35\u0e22\u0e27 - literally means green water).

2010)\n* Red Soda (strawberry) - This flavour is now listed on the packaging. Before, it was just called red soda or nam dang (\u0e19\u0e49\u0e33\u0e41\u0e14\u0e07 - literally means red water). Red Fanta was reportedly the preferred drink of the then-King of Thailand [[Bhumibol Adulyadej]]. Glasses and open bottles of red Fanta are often seen as offerings on the small altars displayed in most Thai homes and shops.
