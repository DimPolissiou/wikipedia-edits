It is expected to have 20 GW of nuclear capacity by 2020, though it currently stands as 9th in the world in terms of nuclear capacity.\n\nAn Achilles' heel of the Indian nuclear power programme, however, is the fact that India is not a signatory of the [[Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons|Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty]]. This has many times in its history prevented it from obtaining nuclear technology vital to expanding its nuclear industry. Another consequence of this is that much of its programme has been domestically developed much like its nuclear weapons programme. The [[United States-India Peaceful Atomic Energy Cooperation Act]] seems to be a way to get access to advanced nuclear technologies for India.\n\n{{further information|India's three-stage nuclear power programme}}\nIndia has been using imported enriched uranium and is under International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards, but it has developed various aspects of the nuclear fuel cycle to support its reactors. Development of select technologies has been strongly affected by limited imports. Use of heavy-water reactors has been particularly attractive for the nation because it allows uranium to be burnt with little to no enrichment. India has also done a great amount of work in the development of a [[India's three stage nuclear power programme|thorium-centred fuel cycle]]. While uranium deposits in the nation are extremely limited, there are much greater reserves of thorium, and it could provide hundreds of times the energy with the same mass of fuel. The fact that thorium can theoretically be utilised in heavy water reactors has tied the development of the two. A prototype reactor that would burn uranium-plutonium fuel while irradiating a thorium blanket is under construction at the Madras/Kalpakkam Atomic Power Station.\n\nUranium used for the weapons programme has been separate from the power programme using uranium from scant indigenous reserves.\n\n==Hydro electricity==\n{{See also|Hydroelectric power in India}}\nIndia is endowed with economically exploitable and viable hydro potential assessed to be about 125,570 MW at 60% [[capacity factor]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.worldenergy.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/WEResources_Hydropower_2016.pdf  |title=World Energy Resources Hydro Power, 2016 |publisher= World Energy Council|accessdate=30 November 2017 }}</ref> India ranked fourth globally by underutilized hydro power potential.

It is expected to have 20 GW of nuclear capacity by 2020, though it currently stands as 9th in the world in terms of nuclear capacity.\n\nAn Achilles' heel of the Indian nuclear power programme, however, is the fact that India is not a signatory of the [[Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons|Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty]]. This has many times in its history prevented it from obtaining nuclear technology vital to expanding its nuclear industry. Another consequence of this is that much of its programme has been domestically developed much like its nuclear weapons programme. The [[United States-India Peaceful Atomic Energy Cooperation Act]] seems to be a way to get access to advanced nuclear technologies for India.\n\n{{further information|India's three-stage nuclear power programme}}\nIndia has been using imported enriched uranium and is under International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards, but it has developed various aspects of the nuclear fuel cycle to support its reactors. Development of select technologies has been strongly affected by limited imports. Use of heavy-water reactors has been particularly attractive for the nation because it allows uranium to be burnt with little to no enrichment. India has also done a great amount of work in the development of a [[India's three stage nuclear power programme|thorium-centred fuel cycle]]. While uranium deposits in the nation are extremely limited, there are much greater reserves of thorium, and it could provide hundreds of times the energy with the same mass of fuel.

There have been several types os reserach locally, ranging from the predominant study of the Geology and sedimentology on the formation and associated layers, along with the Geochemical, Climatic, and ecosistemic reserach to set the different changes that have been documented along the Formation. Paleogeography, Paleontology, Palynology, Tectonics, and several other knids of works have been done along the Formation. The Most Studied section has been the German, with the other being found as part of the Posidonia on Late 1960-80s works, and most of them not covered yet.\n\n=== 1800s ===\n[[File:Friedrich August von Quenstedt.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Friedrich August von Quenstedt a German Mineralogist that studied the jurassic strata along Germany, including the Black Shales of the Posidonia Shale.]]\nThe first related studies with the Posidonia Shale Strata where done on the Early 1800. At the first the Formation Wasn\u00b4t identifed as a separated unit. The first fossils where recovered on several Collections, some since the Modern Age, present on localities like the Banz Abbey. Among the oldest examples of fossils found on the formation is included the crocodrylomorph [[Steneosaurus]] on 1824, but being identified as a Gharial.<ref>Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, E. (1825).

Geobios 35, 13\u201320.</ref> The Black Shales present on the Posidonia Fm are related to deposits present on Lithuania, Canada and several other countries & Continents. This suggests the presence of a general deposition of organic matter, driven by several global events and changes present on the surface. This caused changes on the bottom of the seas, with abundant deposition of organic matter. It\u00b4s related to a change in carbon-isotope excursion in marine and terrestrial life, and was probably a perturbator of the carbon cycle.<ref>Brumsack, H. J. (1991).

Paleogeography, Paleontology, Palynology, Tectonics, and several other knids of works have been done along the Formation.

International Journal of Coal Geology, 150\u2013151, 127\u2013153. doi:10.1016/j.coal.2015.08.011</ref>Since the first serious evaluations in the 2000s, different organic samples were extracted to revise the changes and potential presence of the Shale Oil on the main quarries of the southern realm. Based on several core samples with abundant organic material (Dinoflagellate cysts and other microorganism fragments, such as microscopic algae) different thermal maturity has been found, specially on the samples from the [[Hils Syncline]] strata. The maturation of this strata has implied losing organic carbon and loss of hydrogen index values. Beyond that, the status of the samples has been stable during at least 40 measured years.<ref>Fang, R., Littke, R., Zieger, L., Baniasad, A., Li, M., & Schwarzbauer, J. (2019).

Geobios 35, 13\u201320.</ref> The Black Shales present on the Posidonia Fm are related to deposits present on Lithuania, Canada and several other countries & Continents. This suggests the presence of a general deposition of organic matter, driven by several global events and changes present on the surface. This caused changes on the bottom of the seas, with abundant deposition of organic matter. It\u00b4s related to a change in carbon-isotope excursion in marine and terrestrial life, and was probably a perturbator of the carbon cycle.<ref>Brumsack, H. J. (1991).

Waters interchange were on of the major effects on the paulatine de-oxygenation showed on most of the Lower Toarcian Layers around the word, with the connection with the Viking Corridor as one of the main effects, due to the arctic waters freshening and breaking the oceanic circulation.<ref>Dera, G., & Donnadieu, Y.

It is [[Diamond cut|cut]] in a rectangular cushion-cut, with 58 [[facet]]s, and measures 39.5&nbsp;mm long, 29.25&nbsp;mm wide and 22.5&nbsp;mm deep.

It was offered to [[Mahbub Ali Khan, Asaf Jah VI|Mahbub Ali Khan]] (the sixth [[nizam]] of Hyderabad). Initially, the nizam was quite uninterested in the diamond and offered a mere 46 lakhs (4 million rupees) for it. The nizam was asked to make a good faith deposit if he was to go through with the transaction. The European jewel cutters did not like this offer but were forced into court when they lost track of the nizam's deposit. Ultimately, the nizam was awarded the diamond for almost half his original offer, 23 lakhs (2.2 million rupees, approx. $50,000 at 2005 rates) when the case was resolved.
