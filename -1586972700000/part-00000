By  the end of the 2nd century it had reached the region around [[Carthage]]. Important Africans who influenced the early development of Christianity include [[Tertullian]], [[Perpetua]], [[Felicitas of Rome|Felicity]], [[Clement of Alexandria]], [[Origen of Alexandria]], [[Cyprian]], [[Athanasius]] and [[Augustine of Hippo]]. In the 4th century the [[Aksumite empire]] was Christianized, and the [[Nubians|Nubian]] kingdoms of [[Nobatia]], [[Makuria]] and [[Alodia]] followed two centuries later.\n\nSince the spread of [[Islam]] into [[North Africa]], the size of Christian congregations as well as their number was reduced, so that of the original churches only the [[Greek Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Eastern Orthodox Church of Alexandria]] and [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria]] (which separated from each other during the [[Council_of_Chalcedon#Consequences:_Chalcedonian_Schism|Chalcedonian Schism]]) in Egypt and the [[Orthodox Tewahedo|Orthodox Tewahedo Church]] (that split into [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church]] and [[Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church]]) in the [[Horn of Africa]] remained. The Ethiopian church held its own distinct religious customs and a unique canon of the [[Bible]]. The Ethiopian church community in the [[Horn of Africa]] wasn't the product of European [[missionary]] work, rather, it had spread through missionaries much earlier (while the [[P'ent'ay (Ethiopian Evangelicalism)|P'ent'ay]] churches are works of a Protestant reformation within Ethiopian Christianity).<ref>http://www.africanchristian.org African Christianity</ref> The position of the head of the Catholic [[Church of Africa]] (Archdiocese of Carthage), the only one permitted to preach in the continent, in 1246 belonged to the [[Diocese of Marocco|bishop of Morocco]].<ref name=\"Olga\"/> The bishopric of Marrakesh continued to exist until the late 16th century.<ref name=\"MTh\"/>\n\n[[Christianity]] is embraced by the majority of the population in most [[Southern Africa]]n, [[Southeast Africa]]n, and [[Central Africa]]n states and others in some parts of [[Horn of Africa]] and [[West Africa]]. The [[Copts|Coptic Christians]] make up a significant minority in Egypt. The ''[[World Book Encyclopedia]]'' has estimated that in 2002 Christians formed 40% of the continent's population, with Muslims forming 45%. In a relatively short time, [[Africa]] has gone from having a majority of followers of indigenous, traditional religions, to being predominantly a continent of Christians and Muslims. Since 2013, [[traditional African religion]]s are declared as the majority religion only in [[Togo]]. Importantly, today within most self-declared Christian communities in Africa, there is significant and sustained syncretism with African Traditional Religious beliefs and practices.<ref>Rosalind Shaw, Charles Stewart, [https://books.google.gr/books?id=KVdNRYsR5JsC&dq Syncretism/Anti-Syncretism: The Politics of Religious Synthesis] (1994)</ref>\n\nNew data from the Gordon Theological Seminary shows that, for the first time ever, more number of Christians live in Africa than on any other single continent.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Johnson |first1=Todd M. |last2=Zurlo |first2=Gina A. |last3=Hickman |first3=Albert W. |last4=Crossing |first4=Peter F. |title=Christianity 2018: More African Christians and Counting Martyrs |journal=International Bulletin of Mission Research |date=November 2017 |volume=42 |issue=1 |pages=20\u201328 |doi=10.1177/2396939317739833 |accessdate=24 September 2019|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/320788300_Christianity_2018_More_African_Christians_and_Counting_Martyrs}}</ref>\n\n\"The results show Africa on top with 631 million Christian residents, Latin America in 2nd place with 601 million Christians, and Europe in 3rd place with 571 million Christians.\"<ref>{{cite web |last1=Mauro |first1=J.-P. |title=Africa overtakes Latin America for the highest Christian population |url=https://aleteia.org/2018/07/24/africa-overtakes-latin-america-for-the-highest-christian-population/ |website=Aleteia \u2014 Catholic Spirituality, Lifestyle, World News, and Culture |accessdate=24 September 2019 |language=en |date=24 July 2018}}</ref> Thanks for reading\n\n==History==\n{{Christianity by country}}\n\n[[Mark the Evangelist]] became the first [[List of Patriarchs of Alexandria|bishop]] of the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Orthodox Church of Alexandria]] in about the year 43.<ref>[[Eusebius of Caesarea]], the author of ''[[Church History (Eusebius)|Ecclesiastical History]]'' in the 4th century, states that St. Mark came to Egypt in the first or third year of the reign of Emperor [[Claudius]], i.e. 41 or 43 A.D. \"Two Thousand years of Coptic Christianity\", Otto F.A.

The churches there were linked to the [[Holy See|Church of Rome]] and provided [[Pope Gelasius I]], [[Pope Miltiades]] and [[Pope Victor I]], all of them Christian Berbers like Saint Augustine and his mother [[Saint Monica]].\n[[File:Spread of Christianity to AD 600 (1).png|thumb|left|{{legend|#1F63A7|Spread of Christianity to AD&nbsp;325}} {{legend|#6AB4FF|Spread of Christianity to AD&nbsp;600}}]]\nAt the beginning of the 3rd century the church in Alexandria expanded rapidly, with five new [[suffragan bishop]]rics. At this time, the Bishop of Alexandria began to be called Pope, as the senior bishop in Egypt. In the middle of the 3rd century the church in Egypt suffered severely in the [[persecution]] under the Emperor [[Decius]]. Many Christians fled from the towns into the desert. When the persecution died down, however, some remained in the desert as [[hermit]]s to pray. This was the beginning of [[Christian monasticism]], which over the following years spread from Africa to other parts of the Gohar, and Europe through [[France]] and [[Ireland]].\n\nThe early 4th century in Egypt began with renewed persecution under the Emperor [[Diocletian]]. In the [[Ethiopia]]n/[[Eritrea]]n [[Kingdom of Aksum]], King [[Ezana of Axum|Ezana]] declared Christianity the official religion after having been converted by [[Frumentius]], resulting in the promotion of Christianity in Ethiopia (eventually leading to the foundation of the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church]]).\n\nIn these first few centuries, African Christian leaders such as [[Origen]], [[Lactantius]], [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]], [[Tertullian]], [[Gaius Marius Victorinus|Marius Victorinus]], [[Pachomius the Great|Pachomius]], [[Didymus the Blind]], [[Ticonius]], [[Cyprian]], [[Athanasius of Alexandria|Athanasius]] and [[Cyril of Alexandria|Cyril]] (along with rivals [[Valentinus (Gnostic)|Valentinus]], [[Plotinus]], [[Arius]] and [[Donatus Magnus]]) influenced the Christian world outside Africa with responses to [[Gnosticism]], [[Arianism]], [[Montanism]], [[Marcionism]], [[Pelagianism]] and [[Manichaeism]], and the idea of the [[University]] (after the [[Library of Alexandria]]), understanding of the [[Trinity]], [[Vetus Latina]] translations, methods of [[exegesis]] and biblical interpretation, [[ecumenical council]]s,  [[Christian monasticism|monasticism]], [[Neoplatonism]] and African literary, dialectical and rhetorical traditions.<ref>Oden, Thomas C.

Wilhite, page 332-334</ref>\n\nMany causes have been seen as to leading to the decline of Christianity in the Maghreb. One of them is the constant wars and conquests as well as persecutions. In addition many Christians also migrated to Europe. The Church at that time lacked the backbone of a [[Monasticism|monastic tradition]] and was still suffering from the aftermath of heresies including the so-called [[Donatist]] heresy, and that this contributed to the early obliteration of the Church in the present day Maghreb. Some historians contrast this with the strong monastic tradition in Coptic Egypt, which is credited as a factor that allowed the Coptic Church to remain the majority faith in that country until around after the 14th century despite numerous persecutions. In addition, the Romans and the Byzantines were unable to completely assimilate the indigenous people like the Berbers.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=IgYqDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA335 Ancient African Christianity: An Introduction to a Unique Context and Tradition] By David E.

In addition, calendar reforms adopted in Europe at this time were disseminated amongst the indigenous Christians of [[Tunis]], which would have not been possible had there been an absence of contact with Rome.\n\nLocal Catholicism came under pressure when the Muslim regimes of the [[Almohad Caliphate|Almohads]] and [[Almoravid dynasty|Almoravids]] came into power, and the record shows demands made that the local Christians of Tunis convert to Islam. There are reports of Christian inhabitants and a bishop in the city of [[Kairouan]] around 1150 AD - a significant event, since this city was founded by [[Arab Muslims]] around 680 AD as their administrative center after their conquest.

Within the Kimbanguist church, [[Simon Kimbangu]] questioned the order of religious deliverance- would God send a white man to preach? The Kimbanguist church believed Jesus was black and regarded symbols with different weight than the Catholic and Protestant Europeans. The common practice of placing crosses and crucifixes in churches was viewed as a graven image in their eyes or a form of idolatry. Also, according to Mazrui, Kimbanguists respected the roles of women in church more than orthodox churches; they gave women the roles of priests and preachers.<ref>Mkenda, Festo. \u201cJesuits, Protestants, and Africa before the Twentieth Century.\u201d Encounters between Jesuits and Protestants in Africa, edited by Festo Mkenda and Robert Aleksander Maryks, vol. 13, Brill, LEIDEN; BOSTON, 2018, pp. 11\u201330.

Polygamy was a topic of debate- many literate Africans interpreted it as acceptable because of information contained in the [[Old Testament]]- while it was condemned by European Christianity. [[Dona Beatriz]] was a woman from Central Africa known for her controversial views on the acceptance of polygamy- she argued that Jesus never condemned it- and she was burnt at the stake. European missionaries were faced with what they considered an issue in maintaining Victorian values, while still promoting the vernacular and literacy. Missionaries largely condemned the controversial African views and worked against leaders branching out. Simon Kimbangu became a [[martyr]], put in a cage because of Western missionaries concern, and died there. \n\nWithin African communities, there were clashes brought on by Christianization. Young leaders formed ideas based on Christianity and challenged elders. Dona Beatriz, an African prophet, made Christianity political and eventually went on to become an African Nationalist, planning to overthrow the Ugandan state with the help of other prophets. According to Paul Kollman, teaching from missionaries was up to the interpretation of each person and took different forms when acted upon. <ref>Kollman, Paul. \u201cClassifying African Christianities: Past, Present, and Future: Part One.\u201d Journal of Religion in Africa, vol. 40, no. 1, 2010, pp. 3\u201332., www.jstor.org/stable/20696840.</ref>\n\n[[File:Christianity percent population in each nation World Map Christian data by Pew Research.svg|thumb|250px|Christianity by country]]\nDavid Adamo, a Nigerian within the [[Aladura]] church chose portions of the Bible that closely resembled what his church found important. They read portions of [[Psalms]] because of the idea that missionaries were not sharing the power of their faith. They found power in reading these verses and put them into the context of their lives. \n\nIn addition to Africanizing Christianity, there were movements to Africanize Islam. In [[Nigeria]], movements were created to arouse Muslims to de-Arabize Islam. There were clashes between people who accepted the de-Arabization and those who did not. These movements took place around 1980, resulting in violent behavior and clashes with police. [[Mirza Ghulam Ahmed]], the founder of the [[Ahmadiyya]] sect, believed that the prophet [[Muhammed]] was the most important prophet, but not the last- departing from typical Muslim views. [[Sunni]] Africans were largely against the Ahmadiyyas; the Ahmadiyyas were the first to translate the Quran into Swahili, and the Sunnis opposed that as well. There was a militarism developed in different groups and movements like the Ahmadiyyas and the [[Ansar (Sudan)|Mahdist]] movement and clashes between groups with opposing views.\n\n== Jesuit Missions in Africa ==\nJesuits missionary expeditions began as early as 1548 in various Regions of Africa. In 1561, [[Gon\u00e7alo da Silveira]], a Portuguese missionary, managed to baptize Monomotapa, king of the Shona people in the territory of Zimbabwe.<ref>Mkenda, Festo. \u201cJesuits, Protestants, and Africa before the Twentieth Century.\u201d ''Encounters between Jesuits and Protestants in Africa'', edited by Festo Mkenda and Robert Aleksander Maryks, vol. 13, Brill, LEIDEN; BOSTON, 2018, pp. 11\u201330. ''JSTOR'', www.jstor.org/stable/10.1163/j.ctvbqs62t.4.</ref> A modest sized group of Jesuits began to establish their presence in the area of Abyssinia, or Ethiopia Superior, around the same time of Silveira's presence in Southern Africa. Although Jesuits regularly confronted persecution and harassment, their mission withstood the test of time for nearly a century. Despite this confrontation, they found success in instituting Catholic doctrine in a region that, prior to the existence of their vocation, maintained strictly established orthodoxies. During the sixteenth century, Jesuits extended their occupation into the old Kongo Kingdom, developing upon a preexisting Catholic mission which had culminated in the construction of a local church. Jesuit missions functioned similarly in Mozambique and Angola until in 1759 the Society was overcome by Portuguese authority.\n\nThe Jesuits went largely unchallenged by rival denominational missions in Africa. Other religious congregations did exist who sought to evangelize regions of the continent under Portuguese dominion, however, their influence was far less significant than that of the Christians. The Jesuit's ascendency to prominence began with the padroado in the fifteenth century and continued until other European countries initiated missions of their own, threatening Portugal's status as sole patron of the continent. The favor of the Jesuits took a negative turn in the mid eighteenth century when Portugal no longer held the same dominion in Africa as it had in the fifteenth century. The Jesuits found themselves expelled from Mozambique and Angola, as a result, the existence of Catholic missions diminished significantly in these regions.\n\n== Christian Education in Africa ==\nChristians and Muslims built schools throughout the continent of Africa, teaching missionary beliefs and philosophies. Since the Quran must only be recited in Arabic, It is necessary that a practitioner of the Muslim faith reads and understands the meaning of Arabic words in order to recite and/or memorize the Quran. As a result of the nature of Islam in Africa, Muslim missionaries were not prompted to translate their sacred text into the native language. Unlike that of Islam, Christian missionaries were compelled to spread an understanding of their gospel in the native language of the indigenous people they sought to convert. The bible was then translated and communicated in these native languages. Christian schools did teach English, as well as mathematics, philosophy, and values inherent to Western culture and civilization. The conflicting branches of secularism and religiosity within the Christian schools represents a divergence between the various goals of educational institutions within Africa.<ref>Mazrui, Ali A. \u201cReligion and Political Culture in Africa.\u201d ''Journal of the American Academy of Religion'', vol. 53, no. 4, 1985, pp. 817\u2013839.

There has been tremendous growth in the number of Christians in Africa - coupled by a relative decline in adherence to traditional African religions. Only nine million Christians were in Africa in 1900, but by the year 2000, there were an estimated 380 million Christians. According to a 2006 Pew Forum on Religion and Public life study, 147 million African Christians were \"renewalists\" ([[Pentecostal]]s and [[Charismatic Christianity|Charismatics]]).<ref>\"Gospel Riches, Africa's rapid embrace of prosperity Pentecostalism provokes concern and hope\", ''Christianity Today'', July 2007</ref> According to David Barrett, most of the 552,000 congregations in 11,500 denominations throughout Africa in 1995 are completely unknown in the West.<ref>See \"Ecclesiastical Cartography and the Invisible Continent: The Dictionary of African Christian Biography\" at http://www.dacb.org/xnmaps.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100121045754/http://www.dacb.org/xnmaps.html |date=2010-01-21 }}.</ref> Much of the recent Christian growth in Africa is now due to African evangelism and high birth rates, rather than European missionaries. Christianity in Africa shows tremendous variety, from the ancient forms of [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Orthodox Christianity]] in Egypt, Ethiopia, and Eritrea to the newest African-Christian denominations of [[Nigeria]], a country that has experienced large conversion to Christianity in recent times.  Several [[syncretism|syncretistic]] and [[African initiated church#Messianic churches|messianic]] sections have formed throughout much of the continent, including the [[Nazareth Baptist Church]] in [[South Africa]] and the [[Aladura]] churches in Nigeria. Some [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] missions founded in Africa such as the UD-OLGC, founded by [[Dag Heward-Mills|Evangelist Dag Heward-Mills]], are also quickly spreading in influence all around the world. There are also fairly widespread populations of [[Seventh-day Adventists]] and [[Jehovah's Witnesses]].\n\nSome experts predict the shift of Christianity's center from the European industrialized nations to Africa and Asia in modern times.

The Ethiopian church held its own distinct religious customs and a unique canon of the [[Bible]]. The Ethiopian church community in the [[Horn of Africa]] wasn't the product of European [[missionary]] work, rather, it had spread through missionaries much earlier (while the [[P'ent'ay (Ethiopian Evangelicalism)|P'ent'ay]] churches are works of a Protestant reformation within Ethiopian Christianity).<ref>http://www.africanchristian.org African Christianity</ref> The position of the head of the Catholic [[Church of Africa]] (Archdiocese of Carthage), the only one permitted to preach in the continent, in 1246 belonged to the [[Diocese of Marocco|bishop of Morocco]].<ref name=\"Olga\"/> The bishopric of Marrakesh continued to exist until the late 16th century.<ref name=\"MTh\"/>\n\n[[Christianity]] is embraced by the majority of the population in most [[Southern Africa]]n, [[Southeast Africa]]n, and [[Central Africa]]n states and others in some parts of [[Horn of Africa]] and [[West Africa]].

The ''[[World Book Encyclopedia]]'' has estimated that in 2002 Christians formed 40% of the continent's population, with Muslims forming 45%.

Since 2013, [[traditional African religion]]s are declared as the majority religion only in [[Togo]].

At this time, the Bishop of Alexandria began to be called Pope, as the senior bishop in Egypt. In the middle of the 3rd century the church in Egypt suffered severely in the [[persecution]] under the Emperor [[Decius]]. Many Christians fled from the towns into the desert. When the persecution died down, however, some remained in the desert as [[hermit]]s to pray. This was the beginning of [[Christian monasticism]], which over the following years spread from Africa to other parts of the Gohar, and Europe through [[France]] and [[Ireland]].\n\nThe early 4th century in Egypt began with renewed persecution under the Emperor [[Diocletian]]. In the [[Ethiopia]]n/[[Eritrea]]n [[Kingdom of Aksum]], King [[Ezana of Axum|Ezana]] declared Christianity the official religion after having been converted by [[Frumentius]], resulting in the promotion of Christianity in Ethiopia (eventually leading to the foundation of the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church]]).\n\nIn these first few centuries, African Christian leaders such as [[Origen]], [[Lactantius]], [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]], [[Tertullian]], [[Gaius Marius Victorinus|Marius Victorinus]], [[Pachomius the Great|Pachomius]], [[Didymus the Blind]], [[Ticonius]], [[Cyprian]], [[Athanasius of Alexandria|Athanasius]] and [[Cyril of Alexandria|Cyril]] (along with rivals [[Valentinus (Gnostic)|Valentinus]], [[Plotinus]], [[Arius]] and [[Donatus Magnus]]) influenced the Christian world outside Africa with responses to [[Gnosticism]], [[Arianism]], [[Montanism]], [[Marcionism]], [[Pelagianism]] and [[Manichaeism]], and the idea of the [[University]] (after the [[Library of Alexandria]]), understanding of the [[Trinity]], [[Vetus Latina]] translations, methods of [[exegesis]] and biblical interpretation, [[ecumenical council]]s,  [[Christian monasticism|monasticism]], [[Neoplatonism]] and African literary, dialectical and rhetorical traditions.<ref>Oden, Thomas C.

In addition many Christians also migrated to Europe. The Church at that time lacked the backbone of a [[Monasticism|monastic tradition]] and was still suffering from the aftermath of heresies including the so-called [[Donatist]] heresy, and that this contributed to the early obliteration of the Church in the present day Maghreb. Some historians contrast this with the strong monastic tradition in Coptic Egypt, which is credited as a factor that allowed the Coptic Church to remain the majority faith in that country until around after the 14th century despite numerous persecutions. In addition, the Romans and the Byzantines were unable to completely assimilate the indigenous people like the Berbers.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=IgYqDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA335 Ancient African Christianity: An Introduction to a Unique Context and Tradition] By David E.

[[Jacob Jordaens]], c. 1650]]  \n\nWithin different geographical areas, Africans searched for aspects of Christianity that could more closely resemble their religious and personal practices. \nAdaptations of Protestantism, such as the [[Kimbanguist]] church emerged. Within the Kimbanguist church, [[Simon Kimbangu]] questioned the order of religious deliverance- would God send a white man to preach? The Kimbanguist church believed Jesus was black and regarded symbols with different weight than the Catholic and Protestant Europeans. The common practice of placing crosses and crucifixes in churches was viewed as a graven image in their eyes or a form of idolatry. Also, according to Mazrui, Kimbanguists respected the roles of women in church more than orthodox churches; they gave women the roles of priests and preachers.<ref>Mkenda, Festo. \u201cJesuits, Protestants, and Africa before the Twentieth Century.\u201d Encounters between Jesuits and Protestants in Africa, edited by Festo Mkenda and Robert Aleksander Maryks, vol. 13, Brill, LEIDEN; BOSTON, 2018, pp. 11\u201330.

JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/1464277.\n</ref> Members within these churches looked for practices in the Bible that were not overtly condemned, such as [[polygamy]]. They also incorporated in their own practices relationships with objects and actions like dancing and chanting. <ref>Engelke, Matthew. \u201cThe Book, the Church and the 'Incomprehensible Paradox': Christianity in African History.\u201d Journal of Southern African Studies, vol. 29, no. 1, 2003, pp. 297\u2013306. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/3557421.</ref> When Africans were able to read in the [[vernacular]], they were able to interpret the Bible in their own light. Polygamy was a topic of debate- many literate Africans interpreted it as acceptable because of information contained in the [[Old Testament]]- while it was condemned by European Christianity. [[Dona Beatriz]] was a woman from Central Africa known for her controversial views on the acceptance of polygamy- she argued that Jesus never condemned it- and she was burnt at the stake. European missionaries were faced with what they considered an issue in maintaining Victorian values, while still promoting the vernacular and literacy. Missionaries largely condemned the controversial African views and worked against leaders branching out. Simon Kimbangu became a [[martyr]], put in a cage because of Western missionaries concern, and died there. \n\nWithin African communities, there were clashes brought on by Christianization. Young leaders formed ideas based on Christianity and challenged elders. Dona Beatriz, an African prophet, made Christianity political and eventually went on to become an African Nationalist, planning to overthrow the Ugandan state with the help of other prophets. According to Paul Kollman, teaching from missionaries was up to the interpretation of each person and took different forms when acted upon. <ref>Kollman, Paul. \u201cClassifying African Christianities: Past, Present, and Future: Part One.\u201d Journal of Religion in Africa, vol. 40, no. 1, 2010, pp. 3\u201332., www.jstor.org/stable/20696840.</ref>\n\n[[File:Christianity percent population in each nation World Map Christian data by Pew Research.svg|thumb|250px|Christianity by country]]\nDavid Adamo, a Nigerian within the [[Aladura]] church chose portions of the Bible that closely resembled what his church found important. They read portions of [[Psalms]] because of the idea that missionaries were not sharing the power of their faith. They found power in reading these verses and put them into the context of their lives. \n\nIn addition to Africanizing Christianity, there were movements to Africanize Islam. In [[Nigeria]], movements were created to arouse Muslims to de-Arabize Islam. There were clashes between people who accepted the de-Arabization and those who did not. These movements took place around 1980, resulting in violent behavior and clashes with police. [[Mirza Ghulam Ahmed]], the founder of the [[Ahmadiyya]] sect, believed that the prophet [[Muhammed]] was the most important prophet, but not the last- departing from typical Muslim views. [[Sunni]] Africans were largely against the Ahmadiyyas; the Ahmadiyyas were the first to translate the Quran into Swahili, and the Sunnis opposed that as well. There was a militarism developed in different groups and movements like the Ahmadiyyas and the [[Ansar (Sudan)|Mahdist]] movement and clashes between groups with opposing views.\n\n== Jesuit Missions in Africa ==\nJesuits missionary expeditions began as early as 1548 in various Regions of Africa. In 1561, [[Gon\u00e7alo da Silveira]], a Portuguese missionary, managed to baptize Monomotapa, king of the Shona people in the territory of Zimbabwe.<ref>Mkenda, Festo. \u201cJesuits, Protestants, and Africa before the Twentieth Century.\u201d ''Encounters between Jesuits and Protestants in Africa'', edited by Festo Mkenda and Robert Aleksander Maryks, vol. 13, Brill, LEIDEN; BOSTON, 2018, pp. 11\u201330. ''JSTOR'', www.jstor.org/stable/10.1163/j.ctvbqs62t.4.</ref> A modest sized group of Jesuits began to establish their presence in the area of Abyssinia, or Ethiopia Superior, around the same time of Silveira's presence in Southern Africa. Although Jesuits regularly confronted persecution and harassment, their mission withstood the test of time for nearly a century. Despite this confrontation, they found success in instituting Catholic doctrine in a region that, prior to the existence of their vocation, maintained strictly established orthodoxies. During the sixteenth century, Jesuits extended their occupation into the old Kongo Kingdom, developing upon a preexisting Catholic mission which had culminated in the construction of a local church. Jesuit missions functioned similarly in Mozambique and Angola until in 1759 the Society was overcome by Portuguese authority.\n\nThe Jesuits went largely unchallenged by rival denominational missions in Africa. Other religious congregations did exist who sought to evangelize regions of the continent under Portuguese dominion, however, their influence was far less significant than that of the Christians. The Jesuit's ascendency to prominence began with the padroado in the fifteenth century and continued until other European countries initiated missions of their own, threatening Portugal's status as sole patron of the continent. The favor of the Jesuits took a negative turn in the mid eighteenth century when Portugal no longer held the same dominion in Africa as it had in the fifteenth century. The Jesuits found themselves expelled from Mozambique and Angola, as a result, the existence of Catholic missions diminished significantly in these regions.\n\n== Christian Education in Africa ==\nChristians and Muslims built schools throughout the continent of Africa, teaching missionary beliefs and philosophies. Since the Quran must only be recited in Arabic, It is necessary that a practitioner of the Muslim faith reads and understands the meaning of Arabic words in order to recite and/or memorize the Quran. As a result of the nature of Islam in Africa, Muslim missionaries were not prompted to translate their sacred text into the native language. Unlike that of Islam, Christian missionaries were compelled to spread an understanding of their gospel in the native language of the indigenous people they sought to convert. The bible was then translated and communicated in these native languages. Christian schools did teach English, as well as mathematics, philosophy, and values inherent to Western culture and civilization. The conflicting branches of secularism and religiosity within the Christian schools represents a divergence between the various goals of educational institutions within Africa.<ref>Mazrui, Ali A. \u201cReligion and Political Culture in Africa.\u201d ''Journal of the American Academy of Religion'', vol. 53, no. 4, 1985, pp. 817\u2013839.

There has been tremendous growth in the number of Christians in Africa - coupled by a relative decline in adherence to traditional African religions. Only nine million Christians were in Africa in 1900, but by the year 2000, there were an estimated 380 million Christians. According to a 2006 Pew Forum on Religion and Public life study, 147 million African Christians were \"renewalists\" ([[Pentecostal]]s and [[Charismatic Christianity|Charismatics]]).<ref>\"Gospel Riches, Africa's rapid embrace of prosperity Pentecostalism provokes concern and hope\", ''Christianity Today'', July 2007</ref> According to David Barrett, most of the 552,000 congregations in 11,500 denominations throughout Africa in 1995 are completely unknown in the West.<ref>See \"Ecclesiastical Cartography and the Invisible Continent: The Dictionary of African Christian Biography\" at http://www.dacb.org/xnmaps.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100121045754/http://www.dacb.org/xnmaps.html |date=2010-01-21 }}.</ref> Much of the recent Christian growth in Africa is now due to African evangelism and high birth rates, rather than European missionaries. Christianity in Africa shows tremendous variety, from the ancient forms of [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Orthodox Christianity]] in Egypt, Ethiopia, and Eritrea to the newest African-Christian denominations of [[Nigeria]], a country that has experienced large conversion to Christianity in recent times.  Several [[syncretism|syncretistic]] and [[African initiated church#Messianic churches|messianic]] sections have formed throughout much of the continent, including the [[Nazareth Baptist Church]] in [[South Africa]] and the [[Aladura]] churches in Nigeria. Some [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] missions founded in Africa such as the UD-OLGC, founded by [[Dag Heward-Mills|Evangelist Dag Heward-Mills]], are also quickly spreading in influence all around the world. There are also fairly widespread populations of [[Seventh-day Adventists]] and [[Jehovah's Witnesses]].\n\nSome experts predict the shift of Christianity's center from the European industrialized nations to Africa and Asia in modern times. [[Yale University]] historian [[Lamin Sanneh]] stated that \"African Christianity was not just an exotic, curious phenomenon in an obscure part of the world, but that African Christianity might be the shape of things to come.\"<ref>\"Historian Ahead of His Time\", ''Christianity Today'', February 2007</ref> The statistics from the ''[[World Christian Encyclopedia]]'' (David Barrett) illustrate the emerging trend of dramatic Christian growth on the continent and supposes, that in 2025 there will be 633 million Christians in Africa.<ref>World Council of Churches Report, August 2004</ref>\n\nA 2015 study estimates 2,161,000 Christian believers are from a formerly Muslim background in Africa, most of them belonging to some form of Protestantism.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Johnstone|first1=Patrick|last2=Miller|first2=Duane|title=Believers in Christ from a Muslim Background: A Global Census|journal=IJRR|date=2015|volume=11|page=14|url=https://www.academia.edu/16338087|accessdate=20 November 2015}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n*[[African theology]]\n*[[Afrikaner Calvinism]]\n*[[Christian mysticism in ancient Africa]]\n*[[Roman Catholicism in Africa]]\n*[[Traditional African religion]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Christianity in Africa}}\n* [http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/africa/features/storyofafrica/index_section8.shtml BBC - The Story of Africa and Christianity]\n* [http://www.africanchristian.org African Christian]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20101116113632/https://allaboutreligion.org/history-of-christianity-in-africa-faq.htm African Christianity Faq]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110714162256/http://www.neednotfret.com/content/view/211/47/ Modern Evangelical African Theologians: A Primer]\n\n{{Africa in topic|Christianity in}}\n{{Africa religion}}\n{{Protestant missions to Africa}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Christianity In Africa}}\n[[Category:Christianity in Africa| ]]\n", "name_user": "Mjl1235789", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(Added content)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity_in_Africa"}

Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa assumed leadership of the [[Sangha|monastic community]] following the ''[[Paranirvana|paranirv\u0101\u1e47a]]'' (death) of the Buddha, presiding over the [[First Buddhist council|First Buddhist Council]]. He was considered to be the first [[zushi (Buddhism)|patriarch]] in a number of [[early Buddhism|early Buddhist schools]] and continued to have an important role as patriarch in the [[Chan Buddhism|Chan]] and [[Zen]] traditions. In Buddhist texts, he assumed many identities, that of a renunciant saint, a lawgiver, an anti-establishment figure, but also a \"guarantor of future justice\" in the time of [[Maitreya]], the future Buddha{{sfn |Ray |1994 |p=117}}{{em dash}}he has been described as \"both the anchorite and the friend of mankind, even of the outcast\".{{sfn |Rhys Davids |1914 |p=160}}\n\nIn canonical Buddhist texts in several traditions, Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa was born as '''Pippali''' in a ''[[brahmin]]'' caste family, and entered an arranged marriage with a woman named [[Bhadda Kapilani|Bhadra-Kapil\u0101n\u012b]]. Both of them aspired to lead a celibate life, however, and they decided not to consummate their marriage. Having grown weary of the agricultural profession and the damage it did, they both left the lay life behind to become mendicants. Pippali later met the Buddha, under whom he was [[upasampada|ordained as a monk]], named ''K\u0101\u015byapa'', but later called ''Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa'' to distinguish him from other disciples. Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa became an important disciple of the Buddha, to the extent that the Buddha exchanged his [[Kasaya (clothing)|robe]] with him, which was a symbol of the transmittance of the [[Buddha's Dispensation|Buddhist teaching]]. He became foremost in [[dhutanga|ascetic practices]] and attained [[enlightenment in Buddhism|enlightenment]] shortly after. He often had disputes with [[\u0100nanda]], the attendant of the Buddha, due to their different dispositions and views. Despite his ascetic, strict and stern reputation, he paid an interest in community matters and teaching, and was known for his compassion for the poor, which sometimes caused him to be depicted as an anti-establishment figure. He had a prominent role in the cremation of the Buddha, acting as a sort of eldest son of the Buddha, as well as being the leader in the subsequent First Council. He is depicted as hesitatingly allowing \u0100nanda to participate in the council, and chastising him afterwards for a number of offenses the latter was regarded to have committed.\n\nMah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa's life as described in the early Buddhist texts has been considerably studied by scholars, who have been skeptical about his role in the cremation, his role toward \u0100nanda and the historicity of the council itself. A number of scholars have hypothesized that the accounts have later been embellished to emphasize the values of the Buddhist establishment Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa stood for, emphasizing [[vinaya|monastic discipline]], ''brahmin'' and ascetic values, as opposed to the values of \u0100nanda and other disciples. Regardless, it is clear that Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa had an important role in the early days of the Buddhist community after the Buddha's ''[[Parinirvana|parinirv\u0101\u1e47a]]'', to help establish a stable monastic tradition. He effectively became the leader for the first twenty years after the Buddha, as he had become the most influential figure in the monastic community. For this reason, he was regarded by many early Buddhist schools as a sort of first patriarch, and was seen to have started a [[lineage (Buddhism)|lineage]] of patriarchs of Buddhism.\n\nIn many post-canonical texts, Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa decided at the end of his life to enter a state of [[Nirodha-sam\u0101patti|meditation and suspended animation]], which was believed to cause his physical remains to stay intact in a cave under a mountain called [[Kukku\u1e6dap\u0101da]], until the coming of Maitreya Buddha. This story has led to several [[cult (religious practice)|cults]] and practices, and affected some Buddhist countries up until early modern times. It has been interpreted by scholars as a narrative to physically connect Gautama Buddha and Maitreya Buddha, through the body of Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa and Gautama Buddha's robe, which covered Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa's remains. In Chan Buddhism, this account was less emphasized, but Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa was seen to have received a special mind-to-mind transmission from Gautama Buddha outside of orthodox scripture, which became essential to the identity of Chan. Again, the robe was an important symbol in this transmission. Apart from having a role in texts and lineage, Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa has often been depicted in Buddhist art as a symbol of reassurance and hope for the future of Buddhism.\n\n== In early Buddhist texts ==\nIn the [[Early Buddhist Texts]] of several textual traditions, a dozen [[sutra|discourses]] attributed to Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa have been compiled in a distinct section within several collections of texts. In the [[Pali Canon|P\u0101li tradition]], this is part of the collection called the ''[[Sa\u1e43yutta Nik\u0101ya]]'', and in [[Chinese Buddhist canon|Chinese Buddhist texts]], the collection is called the ''[[\u0100gama (Buddhism)#Sa\u1e43yukta \u0100gama|Sa\u1e43yukta \u0100gama]]''. The latter collection contains two versions of the section on Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa, numbered [[Taisho Tripitaka|Taish\u014d]] 2:99 and 2:100.{{sfn |Mun-keat |2017 |p=295}} The Chinese ''[[Ekottara Agama|Ekottara \u0100gama]]'' also contains a passage that runs parallel to the P\u0101li ''Sa\u1e43yutta'', T2:99 and T2:100, describing a meeting between the Buddha and Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa,{{sfn |Analayo |2015 |pp=12\u201321}} and another passage about him and the monk [[Bakkula]].{{sfn |Analayo |2010 |p=1}} Finally, there are also [[Vinaya]] texts from the [[M\u016blasarv\u0101stiv\u0101da]] tradition about Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa in the [[Tibetan Buddhist canon|Tibetan language]].{{sfn |Clarke |2014 |p=110}}\n\n=== Early life ===\n[[File:Pipphali.jpg|thumb|Pippala Cave in [[Rajgir]], where Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa is recorded to have stayed.{{sfn |Bapat |1956 |p=319}}]]\nP\u0101li accounts relate that Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa was born Pippali in a ''[[brahmin]]'' family in a village called Mah\u0101tittha, in the kingdom of [[Magadha]], present-day India.{{sfn |Karaluvinna |2002 |p=435}} His father was a wealthy landlord who in some sources is named Nyagrodha, and in other sources Kapila or Kosigotta; his mother was Suman\u0101dev\u012b.{{refn |For the father's occupation, see {{harvtxt |Buswell |Lopez |2013 |loc=Bhadra-Kapil\u0101n\u012b}}.

However, her parents wanted her to marry, and to please her mother, she agreed to pay her respects to a shrine of a goddess known for granting a marriage in a high-class family. When she approached the image, however, people noticed that the image appeared ugly compared to her. Her reputation of beauty spread, and soon after Pippali's family learned about her, she was offered in marriage to Pippali.<!--111-->{{sfn |Clarke |2014 |pp=110\u2013111}}\n\nNext, in the P\u0101li version of the story, the two exchanged letters to indicate their lack of interest, only to find their letters intercepted by their parents and being forced to marry anyway.{{sfn |Buswell |Lopez |2013 |loc=Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa}} In the M\u016blasarv\u0101stiv\u0101da version of the story, however, Pippali went to visit Bhadra, and without revealing his identity, told her that her future husband would be a bad choice for her, because he had no interest in sensual pleasures.

In Buddhist texts, he assumed many identities, that of a renunciant saint, a lawgiver, an anti-establishment figure, but also a \"guarantor of future justice\" in the time of [[Maitreya]], the future Buddha{{sfn |Ray |1994 |p=117}}{{em dash}}he has been described as \"both the anchorite and the friend of mankind, even of the outcast\".{{sfn |Rhys Davids |1914 |p=160}}\n\nIn canonical Buddhist texts in several traditions, Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa was born as '''Pippali''' in a ''[[brahmin]]'' caste family, and entered an arranged marriage with a woman named [[Bhadda Kapilani|Bhadra-Kapil\u0101n\u012b]]. Both of them aspired to lead a celibate life, however, and they decided not to consummate their marriage. Having grown weary of the agricultural profession and the damage it did, they both left the lay life behind to become mendicants. Pippali later met the Buddha, under whom he was [[upasampada|ordained as a monk]], named ''K\u0101\u015byapa'', but later called ''Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa'' to distinguish him from other disciples. Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa became an important disciple of the Buddha, to the extent that the Buddha exchanged his [[Kasaya (clothing)|robe]] with him, which was a symbol of the transmittance of the [[Buddha's Dispensation|Buddhist teaching]]. He became foremost in [[dhutanga|ascetic practices]] and attained [[enlightenment in Buddhism|enlightenment]] shortly after. He often had disputes with [[\u0100nanda]], the attendant of the Buddha, due to their different dispositions and views. Despite his ascetic, strict and stern reputation, he paid an interest in community matters and teaching, and was known for his compassion for the poor, which sometimes caused him to be depicted as an anti-establishment figure. He had a prominent role in the cremation of the Buddha, acting as a sort of eldest son of the Buddha, as well as being the leader in the subsequent First Council. He is depicted as hesitatingly allowing \u0100nanda to participate in the council, and chastising him afterwards for a number of offenses the latter was regarded to have committed.\n\nMah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa's life as described in the early Buddhist texts has been considerably studied by scholars, who have been skeptical about his role in the cremation, his role toward \u0100nanda and the historicity of the council itself. A number of scholars have hypothesized that the accounts have later been embellished to emphasize the values of the Buddhist establishment Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa stood for, emphasizing [[vinaya|monastic discipline]], ''brahmin'' and ascetic values, as opposed to the values of \u0100nanda and other disciples. Regardless, it is clear that Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa had an important role in the early days of the Buddhist community after the Buddha's ''[[Parinirvana|parinirv\u0101\u1e47a]]'', to help establish a stable monastic tradition. He effectively became the leader for the first twenty years after the Buddha, as he had become the most influential figure in the monastic community. For this reason, he was regarded by many early Buddhist schools as a sort of first patriarch, and was seen to have started a [[lineage (Buddhism)|lineage]] of patriarchs of Buddhism.\n\nIn many post-canonical texts, Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa decided at the end of his life to enter a state of [[Nirodha-sam\u0101patti|meditation and suspended animation]], which was believed to cause his physical remains to stay intact in a cave under a mountain called [[Kukku\u1e6dap\u0101da]], until the coming of Maitreya Buddha. This story has led to several [[cult (religious practice)|cults]] and practices, and affected some Buddhist countries up until early modern times. It has been interpreted by scholars as a narrative to physically connect Gautama Buddha and Maitreya Buddha, through the body of Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa and Gautama Buddha's robe, which covered Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa's remains. In Chan Buddhism, this account was less emphasized, but Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa was seen to have received a special mind-to-mind transmission from Gautama Buddha outside of orthodox scripture, which became essential to the identity of Chan. Again, the robe was an important symbol in this transmission. Apart from having a role in texts and lineage, Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa has often been depicted in Buddhist art as a symbol of reassurance and hope for the future of Buddhism.\n\n== In early Buddhist texts ==\nIn the [[Early Buddhist Texts]] of several textual traditions, a dozen [[sutra|discourses]] attributed to Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa have been compiled in a distinct section within several collections of texts. In the [[Pali Canon|P\u0101li tradition]], this is part of the collection called the ''[[Sa\u1e43yutta Nik\u0101ya]]'', and in [[Chinese Buddhist canon|Chinese Buddhist texts]], the collection is called the ''[[\u0100gama (Buddhism)#Sa\u1e43yukta \u0100gama|Sa\u1e43yukta \u0100gama]]''. The latter collection contains two versions of the section on Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa, numbered [[Taisho Tripitaka|Taish\u014d]] 2:99 and 2:100.{{sfn |Mun-keat |2017 |p=295}} The Chinese ''[[Ekottara Agama|Ekottara \u0100gama]]'' also contains a passage that runs parallel to the P\u0101li ''Sa\u1e43yutta'', T2:99 and T2:100, describing a meeting between the Buddha and Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa,{{sfn |Analayo |2015 |pp=12\u201321}} and another passage about him and the monk [[Bakkula]].{{sfn |Analayo |2010 |p=1}} Finally, there are also [[Vinaya]] texts from the [[M\u016blasarv\u0101stiv\u0101da]] tradition about Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa in the [[Tibetan Buddhist canon|Tibetan language]].{{sfn |Clarke |2014 |p=110}}\n\n=== Early life ===\n[[File:Pipphali.jpg|thumb|Pippala Cave in [[Rajgir]], where Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa is recorded to have stayed.{{sfn |Bapat |1956 |p=319}}]]\nP\u0101li accounts relate that Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa was born Pippali in a ''[[brahmin]]'' family in a village called Mah\u0101tittha, in the kingdom of [[Magadha]], present-day India.{{sfn |Karaluvinna |2002 |p=435}} His father was a wealthy landlord who in some sources is named Nyagrodha, and in other sources Kapila or Kosigotta; his mother was Suman\u0101dev\u012b.{{refn |For the father's occupation, see {{harvtxt |Buswell |Lopez |2013 |loc=Bhadra-Kapil\u0101n\u012b}}.

However, her parents wanted her to marry, and to please her mother, she agreed to pay her respects to a shrine of a goddess known for granting a marriage in a high-class family.

Harvey states that the story originated among the \"Chan literati\".}} Although the Flower Sermon's main point is to depict a wordless special transmission \"outside the teaching\", the tradition was defended and authorized through Buddhist scripture.{{sfn |Welter |2000 |p=97}}\n\nThe Flower Sermon event is regarded by modern scholars as an invention, but does provide insight into the philosophical concerns and identity of Chan Buddhism.<ref name=\"Herschock\" /> Since Chan Buddhism values the direct transmission from the teacher's mind to that of the student, more so than scriptures, the unbroken lineage of patriarchs is an important part of the tradition.{{sfn |Buswell |Lopez |2013 |loc=fozu}} Moreover, whereas in many Buddhist traditions it was recounted that Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa would pass on Gautama Buddha's robe to Maitreya Buddha, in Chan a different tradition developed, in which Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa passed on the robe to the next patriarch \u0100nanda, and so on through a list of Indian and Chinese patriarchs.<!--339--> Some Chan masters, such as [[D\u014dgen]] (1200\u20131253), did believe that this robe would eventually be passed forward to Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa and eventually Maitreya.<!--340-->{{sfn |Faure |1995 |pp=339\u2013340}}\n\nAs Japanese Buddhist texts saw the transmission of Gautama Buddha's robe as a symbol of birth and gestation, similarly, the flower in the Flower Sermon was seen as a symbol of death and cremation.{{sfn |Faure |1995 |p=361, note 119}} Besides the Flower Sermon, the appearance of the Buddha's feet when Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa pays his final respects, as well as the Buddha sharing his seat with Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa are also considered mind-to-mind transmissions.{{sfn |Do-Ryun |1964 |p=41}}\n\n== Legacy ==\n=== Values ===\n[[File:Mahakasyapa, Kizil, Cave above the Largest Cave, c. 422-529 AD, wall painting - Ethnological Museum, Berlin - DSC01724.JPG|Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa depicted with hair and beard.

Monastic vocations and monastic orders tend to be along these two ends of the spectrum,<!--177-178--> with compassionate engagement on the one hand, and dispassionate detachment on the other hand.<!--187--> This can be traced back to these two disciples.<!--178-->{{sfn |Tilakaratne |2003 |pp=177\u2013178, 187}} Specifically, the Therav\u0101da tradition has been influenced much by the model of Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa.{{sfn |Analayo |2010 |p=17}} In some early Therav\u0101da texts about Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa, the values of forest renunciation are contrasted with that of settled monasticism.

Indeed, later Buddhist texts depict Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa as the eldest son of the Buddha, who leads both the funerals of his father and, as his heir, presides over the First Council.<!--20-21--> Eventually, he came to be seen as the first teacher after the Buddha and as the beginning of a lineage of teachers.

In both the Nik\u0101ya and \u0100gama version of this same collection, therefore, a great deal of attention is given to him, and Tournier thinks it possible that the lineage of teachers preserving this collection, probably originating from the Sth\u0101viras, also conceived themselves as preservers of Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa's legacy.<!--26--> This is also reflected in the language used in inscriptions from the Sinhalese monk Mah\u0101n\u0101man (5th\u20136th century CE) and in later texts used in the Sinhalese tradition, which both connect Mah\u0101n\u0101man's lineage with that of Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa, and also that of the future Buddha Maitreya.<!--26-29-->{{sfn |Tournier |2014 |pp=26\u201329}} However, some P\u0101li sources indicate that Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa was part of the lineage of the ''A\u1e45guttara Nik\u0101ya'' [[Bh\u0101\u1e47aka|reciters]], which is another collection than the ''Sa\u1e43yutta''.{{sfn |Gethin |2008 |p=18}}\n\nOne of the early Buddhist schools, the [[K\u0101\u015byap\u012bya]]s ({{lang-pi|Kassap\u012bya}}), was founded by Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa, according to scholars [[Paramartha|Param\u0101rtha]] (499\u2013569) and [[Kuiji]] (632\u2013682).

Cognitive-behavioral practitioners often conceptualize the disorders as being the result of [[operant conditioning]], [[Chaining|behavioral chaining]], distorted cognitions, and poor coping mechanisms.<ref>Gauthier & Pellerin, 1982.</ref><ref>Kohn & Antonuccio, 2002.</ref> Cognitive-behavioral models suggest that the behavior is [[reinforcement|positively reinforced]] after the person steals some items. If this individual experiences minimal or no negative consequences (punishment), then the likelihood that the behavior will reoccur is increased. As the behavior continues to occur, stronger antecedents or cues become contingently linked with it, in what ultimately becomes a powerful behavioral chain. According to cognitive-behavioral theory (CBT), both antecedents and consequences may either be in the environment or cognitions. For example, Kohn and Antonuccio (2002) describe a client\u2019s antecedent cognitions, which include thoughts such as \"I\u2019m smarter than others and can get away with it\"; \"they deserve it\"; \"I want to prove to myself that I can do it\"; and \"my family deserves to have better things\". These thoughts were strong cues to stealing behaviors. All of these thoughts were precipitated by additional antecedents which were thoughts about family, financial, and work stressors or feelings of depression. \"Maintaining\" cognitions provided additional reinforcement for stealing behaviors and included feelings of vindication and pride, for example: \"score one for the 'little guy' against the big corporations\". Although those thoughts were often afterward accompanied by feelings of remorse, this came too late in the operant sequence to serve as a viable punisher. Eventually, individuals with kleptomania come to rely upon stealing as a way of coping with stressful situations and distressing feelings, which serve to further maintain the behavior and decrease the number of available alternative coping strategies.<ref>{{cite book|last1=John|first1=C.S. |author2=Kalal, D.

This would suggest that poor regulation of [[serotonin]], [[dopamine]], and/or natural opioids within the brain are to blame for kleptomania, linking it with impulse control and affective disorders.<ref name=Goldman1991/><ref name=GrantKim2002/><ref name=Dannon2001/>\n\nAn alternative explanation too based on opioid antagonist studies states that kleptomania is similar to the \"self-medication\" model, in which stealing stimulates the person\u2019s natural opioid system. \"The opioid release 'soothes' the patients, treats their sadness, or reduces their anxiety. Thus, stealing is a mechanism to relieve oneself from a chronic state of hyperarousal, perhaps produced by prior stressful or traumatic events, and thereby modulate affective states.\"<ref name=GrantKim2002/>{{rp|354}}\n\n== Diagnosis ==\nDisagreement surrounds the method by which kleptomania is considered and diagnosed. On one hand, some researchers believe that kleptomania is merely theft and dispute the suggestion that there are psychological mechanisms involved, while others observe kleptomania as part of a substance-related addiction. Yet others categorize kleptomania as a variation of an impulse control disorder, such as [[obsessive-compulsive disorder]] or eating disorders.<ref name=GrantKim2002>{{cite journal | last1 = Grant | first1 = J.E. | last2 = Kim | first2 = S.W. | year = 2002 | title = Clinical characteristics and associated psychopathology of 22 patients with kleptomania | url = | journal = Comprehensive Psychiatry | volume = 43 | issue = | page = 5 | doi = 10.1053/comp.2002.34628 | pmid = 12216013 }}</ref>{{rp|378\u201384}}\n\nAccording to the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' fourth edition (DSM IV-TR), a frequent and widely used guide for the diagnosis of mental disorders, the following symptoms and characteristics are the diagnostic criteria for kleptomania:\n#  repeated inability to defend against urges to steal things that are not essential for private use or for their economic value;\n#  escalating sense of pressure immediately prior to performing the theft;\n#  satisfaction, fulfillment or relief at the point of performing the theft;\n#  the theft is not executed to convey antagonism or revenge, and is not in reaction to a delusion or a fantasy; and\n#  the thieving is not better accounted for by behavior disorder, a manic episode, or antisocial personality disorder.<ref name=PrestaMarazziti>{{cite journal | last1 = Presta | first1 = S. | last2 = Marazziti | first2 = D. | last3 = Dell'Osso | first3 = L. | last4 = Pfanner | first4 = C. | last5 = Pallanti | first5 = S. | last6 = Cassano | first6 = G.B. | year = 2002 | title = Kleptomania: clinical features and comorbidity in an Italian sample | url = | journal = Comprehensive Psychiatry | volume = 43 | issue = 1| pages = 7\u201312 | doi = 10.1053/comp.2002.29851 | pmid = 11788913 }}</ref>\n\nSkeptics have decried kleptomania as an invalid psychiatric concept exploited in legal defenses of wealthy female shoplifters.

Phenomenological data maintain that there is a relationship between kleptomania and drug addictions. A higher percentage of cases of kleptomania has been noted in adolescents and young adults, and a lesser number of cases among older adults, which imply an analogous natural history to that seen in substance use disorders. Family history data also propose a probable common genetic input to alcohol use and kleptomania. Substance use disorders are more common in kin of persons with kleptomania than in the general population. Furthermore, pharmacological data (e.g., the probable efficacy of the opioid antagonist, [[naltrexone]], in the treatment of both kleptomania and substance use disorders) could present additional support for a joint relationship between kleptomania and substance use disorders. Based on the idea that kleptomania and substance use disorders may share some etiological features, it could be concluded that kleptomania would react optimistically to the same treatments. As a matter of fact, certain nonmedical treatment methods that are successful in treating substance abuse are also accommodating in treating kleptomania.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Grant|first1=J.E.|last2=Grant|first2=M.P.H. |last3=Odlaug|first3=Brian L.|last4=Kim |first4=S.W.|title=Kleptomania: Clinical Characteristics and Relationship to Substance Use Disorders|journal=The American Journal of Drug and Alcohol Abuse|year=2010|volume=36|pages=291\u2013295|doi=10.3109/00952991003721100|pmid=20575650|issue=5}}</ref>\n\n=== Obsessive-compulsive disorder ===<!-- An earlier section links here.

Therefore, a diverse range of therapeutic approaches have been introduced for its treatment. These treatments include: psychoanalytic oriented psychotherapy, behavioral therapy, and pharmacotherapy.<ref name=Dannon2001/>\n\n=== Psychoanalytic and psychodynamic approach ===\nSeveral explanations of the mechanics of kleptomania have been presented. A contemporary social approach proposes that kleptomania is an outcome of consumerism and the large quantity of commodities in society. [[Psychodynamic]] theories depend on a variety of points of view in defining the disorder. [[Psychoanalytic theory|Psychoanalysts]] define the condition as an indication of a defense mechanism deriving in the unconscious ego against anxiety, prohibited intuition or desires, unsettled struggle or forbidden sexual drives, dread of castration, sexual excitement, and sexual fulfillment and orgasm throughout the act of stealing.<ref>\"From stack-firing to pyromania: medico-legal concepts of insane arson in British, US and European contexts, c. 1800-1913\". Part I. ''History of Psychiatry''. 2010; '''21''': 243-260</ref> The psychoanalytic and psycho-dynamic approach to kleptomania granted the basis for prolonged psychoanalytic or psycho-dynamic [[psychotherapy]] as the core treatment method for a number of years. Like most psychiatric conditions, kleptomania was observed within the psycho-dynamic lens instead of being viewed as a bio-medical disorder. However, the prevalence of psychoanalytic approach contributed to the growth of other approaches, particularly in the biological domain.<ref>Levy, Sidney (2007). \"Challenging the Philosophical Assumptions of Marketing\". ''Journal of Macro-marketing''. 27: 7-14.</ref>\n\n=== Behavioral and cognitive intervention ===\n[[Cognitive-behavioural therapy]] (CBT) has primarily substituted the psychoanalytic and dynamic approach in the treatment of kleptomania. Numerous behavioural approaches have been recommended as helpful according to several cases stated in the literature. They include: hidden sensitisation by unpleasant images of nausea and vomiting, [[aversion therapy]] (for example, aversive holding of breath to achieve a slightly painful feeling every time a desire to steal or the act is imagined), and [[systematic desensitisation]].<ref>\"Historical Research in the Journal of Macromarketing, 1981-2005\". ''Journal of Macromarketing''. 2006; '''26''': 178-192.</ref> In certain instances, the use of combining several methods such as hidden sensitisation along with exposure and response prevention were applied. Even though the approaches used in CBT need more research and investigation in kleptomania, success in combining these methods with medication was illustrated over the use of drug treatment as the single method of treatment.<ref>\"Introduction to the Special Issue on the History of Marketing Thought\". ''Marketing Theory''. September 1, 2005. '''5''': 235-237.</ref>\n\n=== Drug treatment ===\nThe phenomenological similarity and the suggested common basic biological dynamics of kleptomania and OCD, pathological gambling and trichotillomania gave rise to the theory that the similar groups of medications could be used in all these conditions. Consequently, the primary use of [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor]] (SSRI) group, which is a form of antidepressant, has been used in kleptomania and other impulse control disorders such as binge eating and OCD. [[Electroconvulsive therapy]] (ECT), [[lithium pharmacology|lithium]] and [[valproic acid]] (sodium valproate) have been used as well.<ref>\"Consumer Misbehavior: The Rise of Self-Service Grocery Retailing and Shoplifting in the United Kingdom c. 1950-1970\". ''Journal of Macromarketing''. June 1, 2005. '''25''': 66-75.</ref>\n\nThe SSRI's usage is due to the assumption that the biological dynamics of these conditions derives from low levels of [[serotonin]] in brain synapses, and that the efficacy of this type of therapy will be relevant to kleptomania and to other comorbid conditions.<ref>\"Sources of Immoderation and Proportion in Marketing\".

Cognitive-behavioral practitioners often conceptualize the disorders as being the result of [[operant conditioning]], [[Chaining|behavioral chaining]], distorted cognitions, and poor coping mechanisms.<ref>Gauthier & Pellerin, 1982.</ref><ref>Kohn & Antonuccio, 2002.</ref> Cognitive-behavioral models suggest that the behavior is [[reinforcement|positively reinforced]] after the person steals some items. If this individual experiences minimal or no negative consequences (punishment), then the likelihood that the behavior will reoccur is increased. As the behavior continues to occur, stronger antecedents or cues become contingently linked with it, in what ultimately becomes a powerful behavioral chain. According to cognitive-behavioral theory (CBT), both antecedents and consequences may either be in the environment or cognitions. For example, Kohn and Antonuccio (2002) describe a client\u2019s antecedent cognitions, which include thoughts such as \"I\u2019m smarter than others and can get away with it\"; \"they deserve it\"; \"I want to prove to myself that I can do it\"; and \"my family deserves to have better things\". These thoughts were strong cues to stealing behaviors. All of these thoughts were precipitated by additional antecedents which were thoughts about family, financial, and work stressors or feelings of depression. \"Maintaining\" cognitions provided additional reinforcement for stealing behaviors and included feelings of vindication and pride, for example: \"score one for the 'little guy' against the big corporations\". Although those thoughts were often afterward accompanied by feelings of remorse, this came too late in the operant sequence to serve as a viable punisher. Eventually, individuals with kleptomania come to rely upon stealing as a way of coping with stressful situations and distressing feelings, which serve to further maintain the behavior and decrease the number of available alternative coping strategies.<ref>{{cite book|last1=John|first1=C.S. |author2=Kalal, D.

This would suggest that poor regulation of [[serotonin]], [[dopamine]], and/or natural opioids within the brain are to blame for kleptomania, linking it with impulse control and affective disorders.<ref name=Goldman1991/><ref name=GrantKim2002/><ref name=Dannon2001/>\n\nAn alternative explanation too based on opioid antagonist studies states that kleptomania is similar to the \"self-medication\" model, in which stealing stimulates the person\u2019s natural opioid system. \"The opioid release 'soothes' the patients, treats their sadness, or reduces their anxiety. Thus, stealing is a mechanism to relieve oneself from a chronic state of hyperarousal, perhaps produced by prior stressful or traumatic events, and thereby modulate affective states.\"<ref name=GrantKim2002/>{{rp|354}}\n\n== Diagnosis ==\nDisagreement surrounds the method by which kleptomania is considered and diagnosed. On one hand, some researchers believe that kleptomania is merely theft and dispute the suggestion that there are psychological mechanisms involved, while others observe kleptomania as part of a substance-related addiction. Yet others categorize kleptomania as a variation of an impulse control disorder, such as [[obsessive-compulsive disorder]] or eating disorders.<ref name=GrantKim2002>Grant, J.E.; Kim, S.W.

Phenomenological data maintain that there is a relationship between kleptomania and drug addictions. A higher percentage of cases of kleptomania has been noted in adolescents and young adults, and a lesser number of cases among older adults, which imply an analogous natural history to that seen in substance use disorders. Family history data also propose a probable common genetic input to alcohol use and kleptomania. Substance use disorders are more common in kin of persons with kleptomania than in the general population. Furthermore, pharmacological data (e.g., the probable efficacy of the opioid antagonist, [[naltrexone]], in the treatment of both kleptomania and substance use disorders) could present additional support for a joint relationship between kleptomania and substance use disorders. Based on the idea that kleptomania and substance use disorders may share some etiological features, it could be concluded that kleptomania would react optimistically to the same treatments. As a matter of fact, certain nonmedical treatment methods that are successful in treating substance abuse are also accommodating in treating kleptomania.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Grant|first1=J.E.|last2=Grant|first2=M.P.H. |last3=Odlaug|first3=Brian L.|last4=Kim |first4=S.W.|title=Kleptomania: Clinical Characteristics and Relationship to Substance Use Disorders|journal=The American Journal of Drug and Alcohol Abuse|year=2010|volume=36|pages=291\u2013295|doi=10.3109/00952991003721100|pmid=20575650|issue=5}}</ref>\n\n=== Obsessive-compulsive disorder ===<!-- An earlier section links here. Please do not change. -->\nKleptomania is frequently thought of as being a part of [[obsessive-compulsive disorder]] (OCD), since the irresistible and uncontrollable actions are similar to the frequently excessive, unnecessary, and unwanted rituals of OCD. Some individuals with kleptomania demonstrate hoarding symptoms that resemble those with OCD.\nPrevalence rates between the two disorders do not demonstrate a strong relationship. Studies examining the comorbidity of OCD in subjects with kleptomania have inconsistent results, with some showing a relatively high co-occurrence (45%-60%)<ref name=PrestaMarazziti/><ref name=McElroyPope/> while others demonstrate low rates (0%-6.5%).<ref name=BayleCaci/><ref name=GrantCompPsych/> Similarly, when rates of kleptomania have been examined in subjects with OCD, a relatively low co-occurrence was found (2.2%-5.9%).<ref name=MatsungaKiriike/><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Fontenelle | first1 = L.F. | last2 = Mendlowicz | first2 = M.V. | last3 = Versiani | first3 = M. | year = 2005 | title = Impulse control disorders in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder | url = | journal = Psychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences | volume = 59 | issue = 1| pages = 30\u201337 | doi=10.1111/j.1440-1819.2005.01328.x | pmid=15679537}}</ref>\n\n=== Pyromania ===\n[[Pyromania]], another impulse disorder, has many ties to kleptomania.

Therefore, a diverse range of therapeutic approaches have been introduced for its treatment. These treatments include: psychoanalytic oriented psychotherapy, behavioral therapy, and pharmacotherapy.<ref name=Dannon2001/>\n\n=== Psychoanalytic and psychodynamic approach ===\nSeveral explanations of the mechanics of kleptomania have been presented. A contemporary social approach proposes that kleptomania is an outcome of consumerism and the large quantity of commodities in society. [[Psychodynamic]] theories depend on a variety of points of view in defining the disorder. [[Psychoanalytic theory|Psychoanalysts]] define the condition as an indication of a defense mechanism deriving in the unconscious ego against anxiety, prohibited intuition or desires, unsettled struggle or forbidden sexual drives, dread of castration, sexual excitement, and sexual fulfillment and orgasm throughout the act of stealing.<ref>\"From stack-firing to pyromania: medico-legal concepts of insane arson in British, US and European contexts, c. 1800-1913\". Part I. ''History of Psychiatry''. September 1, 2010. '''21''': 243-260</ref> The psychoanalytic and psycho-dynamic approach to kleptomania granted the basis for prolonged psychoanalytic or psycho-dynamic [[psychotherapy]] as the core treatment method for a number of years. Like most psychiatric conditions, kleptomania was observed within the psycho-dynamic lens instead of being viewed as a bio-medical disorder. However, the prevalence of psychoanalytic approach contributed to the growth of other approaches, particularly in the biological domain.<ref>Levy, Sidney (March 1, 2007). \"Challenging the Philosophical Assumptions of Marketing\". ''Journal of Macro-marketing''. '''27''': 7-14.</ref>\n\n=== Behavioral and cognitive intervention ===\n[[Cognitive-behavioural therapy]] (CBT) has primarily substituted the psychoanalytic and dynamic approach in the treatment of kleptomania. Numerous behavioural approaches have been recommended as helpful according to several cases stated in the literature. They include: hidden sensitisation by unpleasant images of nausea and vomiting, [[aversion therapy]] (for example, aversive holding of breath to achieve a slightly painful feeling every time a desire to steal or the act is imagined), and [[systematic desensitisation]].<ref>\"Historical Research in the Journal of Macromarketing, 1981-2005\". ''Journal of Macromarketing''. December 1, 2006. '''26''': 178-192.</ref> In certain instances, the use of combining several methods such as hidden sensitisation along with exposure and response prevention were applied. Even though the approaches used in CBT need more research and investigation in kleptomania, success in combining these methods with medication was illustrated over the use of drug treatment as the single method of treatment.<ref>\"Introduction to the Special Issue on the History of Marketing Thought\". ''Marketing Theory''. September 1, 2005. '''5''': 235-237.</ref>\n\n=== Drug treatment ===\nThe phenomenological similarity and the suggested common basic biological dynamics of kleptomania and OCD, pathological gambling and trichotillomania gave rise to the theory that the similar groups of medications could be used in all these conditions. Consequently, the primary use of [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor]] (SSRI) group, which is a form of antidepressant, has been used in kleptomania and other impulse control disorders such as binge eating and OCD. [[Electroconvulsive therapy]] (ECT), [[lithium pharmacology|lithium]] and [[valproic acid]] (sodium valproate) have been used as well.<ref>\"Consumer Misbehavior: The Rise of Self-Service Grocery Retailing and Shoplifting in the United Kingdom c. 1950-1970\". ''Journal of Macromarketing''. June 1, 2005. '''25''': 66-75.</ref>\n\nThe SSRI's usage is due to the assumption that the biological dynamics of these conditions derives from low levels of [[serotonin]] in brain synapses, and that the efficacy of this type of therapy will be relevant to kleptomania and to other comorbid conditions.<ref>\"Sources of Immoderation and Proportion in Marketing\".

This quality makes them helpful in treating kleptomania and impulse control disorders in general. The most frequently used drug is [[naltrexone]], a long-acting competitive antagonist.

In 1924, one of his followers, [[Wilhelm Stekel]], read the case of a female kleptomaniac who was driven by suppressed sexual urges to take hold of \"something forbidden, secretly\".

A high-ranking member of the Van der Linde gang, Arthur must deal with the decline of the [[Wild West]] while attempting to survive against government forces, rival gangs, and other adversaries in a fictionalized representation of the [[Western United States|Western]], [[Midwestern United States|Midwestern]] and [[Southern United States]]. He is portrayed by [[Roger Clark (actor, born 1978)|Roger Clark]], who provided the character's voice and [[performance capture]].\n\nThe development team at [[Rockstar Games]] decided that the player would control one character in ''Red Dead Redemption 2'', as opposed to the three protagonists in Rockstar's previous title ''[[Grand Theft Auto V]]'' (2013), in order to follow the character more personally and understand how the events impact him. They felt that a single character felt more appropriate for the narrative structure of a Western. Clark wanted to portray the character in a manner that was complex enough for the player to choose his path and still make sense. He took inspiration from actors such as [[Toshiro Mifune]], [[John Wayne]], and [[Rob Wiethoff]], who also played [[John Marston (Red Dead)|John Marston]] in the game and [[Red Dead Redemption|its predecessor]].\n\nThe character has received acclaim from critics, with his complexity and path to redemption most frequently the subject of praise. Reviewers also lauded the character for bringing the game's world and other characters to life. For his work on the game, Clark received numerous [[List of accolades received by Red Dead Redemption 2|nominations]] and was awarded Best Performance at [[The Game Awards 2018|The Game Awards]].\n\n== Character development ==\nThe development team at [[Rockstar Games]] decided that the player would control one character in ''[[Red Dead Redemption 2]]'', as opposed to the three protagonists in Rockstar's previous title ''[[Grand Theft Auto V]]'' (2013), in order to follow the character more personally and understand how the events impact him.<ref name=\"Variety\"/> They felt that a single character felt more appropriate for the narrative structure of a Western.<ref name=\"THR\"/> Producer Rob Nelson felt that the decision to limit to one protagonist shaped the other creative decisions of development. The conversations and sense of life within the gang environment was inspired by ''Grand Theft Auto V''{{'}}s exploration of the lives of two of the game's playable characters while the player was controlling the other one.<ref name=\"Variety\"/> Rockstar wanted to grant agency to the player when experiencing the story of Arthur Morgan; writer Michael Unsworth noted that Arthur is neither controlled by the storytellers or by the player, but consists of \"a delicate push and pull between the two\".<ref name=\"Variety\"/> The team attempted to give the player more freedom with Arthur's relationship with other characters; when the narrative begins, Arthur has already formed relationships with the other gang members, so the team aimed to develop them in a way for the player to respond appropriately.<ref name=\"VentureBeat\"/>\n\n[[Roger Clark (actor, born 1978)|Roger Clark]] portrayed Arthur in the game. His work was recorded using [[performance capture]], involving simultaneous recording of movement and voice; a small part of his performance was recorded in a voiceover booth.<ref name=\"Shacknews\"/> For his portrayal, Clark took main inspiration from [[Toshiro Mifune]].<ref name=\"THR Cast\"/> He found that Mifune's characters were very stoic while also having a \"crazy\" sense of humor, a complexity he wanted to portray within Arthur.<ref name=\"VG247 Clark\"/> Clark also took inspiration from ''[[The Proposition (2005 film)|The Proposition]]'' (2005) as it involved a similar situation to Arthur's, wherein he is forced to betray some of his loyalties. He watched films such as ''[[High Noon]]'' (1952), as well as the work of [[John Wayne]];<ref name=\"Twinfinite Clark\"/> despite watching the ''[[Dollars Trilogy]]'' (1964\u20131966) he did not take much inspiration from [[Clint Eastwood]]'s portrayal of the [[Man with No Name]], as he felt that Arthur was more talkative.<ref name=\"THR Cast\"/> Clark regularly listened to [[Don Edwards]]' 1993 version of the song {{nowrap|\"[[Coyotes (song)|Coyotes]]\"}} during production for inspiration.<ref name=\"SacAnime\"/>\n\nClark wanted to portray a character that was complex enough for the player to choose his path and still make sense. He initially faced difficulty with this concept, as the high honor performance was different to the low honor, but he reminded himself that Arthur was a complex character who could easily contradict himself.<ref name=\"Twinfinite Clark\"/> He aimed to portray vulnerability with Arthur's ego. Clark felt that Arthur initially resented [[John Marston (Red Dead Redemption)|John Marston]], as he had a family\u2014something Arthur wishes he could have\u2014but as the gang begins to fall apart, Arthur acts to help John, \"try[ing] to do what he wishes he could have done for himself\".<ref name=\"VG247 Clark\"/> Clark looked to [[Rob Wiethoff]]'s portrayal as John in the first game for inspiration with his own performance.<ref name=\"Shacknews\"/> A second love interest for Arthur was cut from the game during development.<ref name=\"Vulture\"/>\n\nVice President of Creativity [[Dan Houser]] was interested in subverting the trope of the protagonist starting as weak and becoming stronger as the story progresses; instead, Arthur is already tough at the beginning of the game, and is \"taken on a more intellectual roller coaster when his world view gets taken apart\".<ref name=\"GQ\"/> Houser felt that the decline of the American frontier has a deep impact on Arthur, noting that the character is \"caught between the nastiness of nature and the brutality of encroaching industrialization in civilization\".<ref name=\"Vulture\"/> Houser avoided meeting Clark on set to avoid hearing his real voice.<ref name=\"GQ\"/>\n\n== Appearances ==\nArthur joined the Van der Linde gang when he was 14-years-old, having lost his parents at a young age, and soon became Dutch's first prot\u00e9g\u00e9.{{sfn|Price|2018|p=355}} Arthur had a son, Isaac, with a waitress named Eliza; he demonstrated regular support for them until they were killed by robbers for a trivial sum of money. Over time, Arthur transformed from a lost cause into Dutch's most dedicated enforcer.{{sfn|Price|2018|p=355}} When the gang is forced into a blizzard, Arthur helps to find supplies and later tracks down John. He helps to rob the train owned by Leviticus Cornwall and, after moving to Horseshoe Overlook, fights against Cornwall's hired guns. After moving to Clemens Point, Arthur becomes involved in conflict between two warring families, the Braithwaites and the Grays. The conflict leads to the death of a gang member and the capture of Jack Marston.\n\nArthur retrieves Jack from the supervision of crime lord Angelo Bronte, and helps retaliate against the backstabbing Bronte who leads them into a trap. Arthur notices Dutch's violent outburst as uncharacteristic of him. In Saint Denis, a failed bank heist forces some members of the gang out of town; they soon shipwreck on Guarma, an island near [[Cuba]], but fight alongside a revolutionary in exchange for a ship back to the mainland. Reuniting with the rest of the gang, Arthur and Sadie resolve to save the captured John, much to the disdain of Dutch. Arthur is soon diagnosed with [[tuberculosis]]. Shocked by the grim reality of his imminent death, Arthur contemplates his decisions and reflects on his morals, led further by his friendship with Native American leader Rains Fall. This drives his desire to protect the remnants of the gang, particularly John and his family. Upon saving John, Arthur reveals his growing doubts about Dutch, unable to accept his leader's growing obsession.\n\nDutch seemingly abandons Arthur to die during an assault on an oil refinery, and leaves John for dead when he is shot during a train robbery. When Dutch ignores Arthur's plea to rescue Abigail from Agent Milton, Arthur disavows the gang. Upon confronting Milton, Arthur discovers that Micah Bell has been betraying the gang. He returns to Dutch to inform him of Micah's betrayal; Dutch turns on Arthur and the newly returned John. When Pinkertons invade the camp, Arthur and John flee. Arthur begs John to return to his family. Arthur is soon ambushed by the vengeful Micah, and Dutch intervenes in their fight. Arthur convinces Dutch to abandon Micah and leave. If the player has high honor, Arthur succumbs to his injuries and disease and dies peacefully while watching the sunrise; if the player has low honor, Micah executes him.\n\n== Reception ==\n[[File:Roger Clark - Great Philadelphia Comic Con.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Roger Clark (actor, born 1978)|Roger Clark]]'s performance as Arthur Morgan received high praise from several [[Video game journalism|gaming publications]] and [[List of accolades received by Red Dead Redemption 2|awards ceremonies]].]]\n\nArthur's character received acclaim. ''[[Giant Bomb]]''{{'}}s Alex Navarro wrote that the characters possess humanity often lacking in other Rockstar games, particularly in the thoughtful portrayal of Arthur's internal conflicts.<ref name=\"Giant Bomb Review\"/> Preston Dozsa of ''CG Magazine'' felt similarly, praising the game's interactivity for the player to craft the journey themselves.<ref name=\"CG Magazine Review\"/> ''LevelSkip''{{'}}s Kyle Atwood called Arthur Morgan a \"character of tragedy and, most importantly, humanity\".<ref name=\"LevelSkip\"/> ''[[Kotaku]]''{{'}}s Kirk Hamilton wrote that Arthur initially seemed unremarkable but became more interesting throughout the game, aided by Clark's performance.<ref name=\"Kotaku Review\"/> ''[[Ars Technica]]''{{'}}s Daniel Starkey felt that, while Arthur's story can be considered \"poignant and memorable\", some will see it as a typical story about a \"'bad man' who isn't necessarily in control\".<ref name=\"Ars Technica Review\"/>\n\n''[[GamesRadar+]]''{{'}}s Tom Power felt that Arthur's story reflects that of a [[Shakespearean tragedy]], with some of the game's characters representing the [[five stages of grief]].<ref name=\"GamesRadar Shakespeare\"/> David Meikleham of GamesRadar+ lauded Arthur's story for being \"nothing short of astonishing\", comparing it to ''[[The Last of Us]]'' (2013).<ref name=\"GamesRadar Review\"/> ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly|EGMNow]]''{{'}}s Nick Plessas found the journey of redemption for Arthur Morgan to be \"far more redeeming\" than John Marston's in ''Red Dead Redemption'', noting that his sins heightened his sympathy for the character.<ref name=\"EGM Review\"/> Javy Gwaltney of ''[[Game Informer]]'' echoed this sentiment, noting that Arthur's arc is a \"fantastic take on ''[[memento mori]]'' and how ruthlessly messy and complex redemption can be\".<ref name=\"Game Informer Better\"/> Though ''[[Zero Punctuation]]''{{'}}s [[Ben \"Yahtzee\" Croshaw]] felt that Arthur was \"generic\", he did find himself to be \"quite shook\" by the ending to Arthur's story as \"possibly the emotional impact, more likely from [[delirium tremens]].\"<ref name=\"ZP Review\"/> Conversely, ''[[Eurogamer]]''{{'}}s Martin Robinson considered Arthur to be less compelling than Marston, leading to a confusing narrative as a result.<ref name=\"Eurogamer Review\"/>\n\nSeveral critics felt that the character brought the game's world to life. ''The Guardian''{{'}}s Paul Walker-Emig noted that Arthur's notebook made him feel \"like a real person with his own inner life, rather than a puppet who does our bidding\".<ref name=\"Guardian Notebooks\"/> Peter Suderman, writing for ''[[The New York Times]]'', found that players \"feel for Arthur Morgan, a bad man with a good heart, because his choices are, in fact, your own\".<ref name=\"NYT Art\"/> Laurence Mozafari of ''[[Digital Spy]]'' felt that Arthur perfectly encapsulated the feeling of the Old West.<ref name=\"Digital Spy Review\"/> ''[[VentureBeat]]''{{'}}s Dean Takahashi praised the Clark's performance for adding to the game's immersion and the character's depth.<ref name=\"VentureBeat Review\"/> Luke Reilly of ''[[IGN]]'' celebrated the life brought into the character, describing his voice as having an \"infectious authenticity\".<ref name=\"IGN Review\"/>\n\nFor his role as Arthur, Clark won Best Performance at [[The Game Awards 2018]],<ref name=\"Game Awards 2018\"/> and was awarded gold from [[PlayStation Blog]];<ref name=\"PS Blog\"/> he also received nominations at the [[15th British Academy Games Awards]],<ref name=\"BAFTA\"/> the [[NAVGTR Awards]],<ref name=\"NAVGTR Nom\"/> and the New York Game Awards.<ref name=\"New York Game Awards\"/> The character of Arthur received nominations at the [[22nd Annual D.I.C.E.

American\n}}\n'''Arthur Morgan''' is a [[fictional character]] and the [[protagonist]] of the 2018 video game ''[[Red Dead Redemption 2]]''. A high-ranking member of the Van der Linde gang, Arthur must deal with the decline of the [[Wild West]] while attempting to survive against government forces, rival gangs, and other adversaries in a fictionalized representation of the [[Western United States|Western]], [[Midwestern United States|Midwestern]] and [[Southern United States]]. He is portrayed by [[Roger Clark (actor, born 1978)|Roger Clark]], who provided the character's [[performance capture]].\n\nThe development team at [[Rockstar Games]] decided that the player would control one character in ''Red Dead Redemption 2'', as opposed to the three protagonists in Rockstar's previous title ''[[Grand Theft Auto V]]'' (2013), in order to follow the character more personally and understand how the events impact him. They felt that a single character felt more appropriate for the narrative structure of a Western. Clark wanted to portray the character in a manner that was complex enough for the player to choose his path and still make sense. He took inspiration from actors such as [[Toshiro Mifune]], [[John Wayne]], and [[Rob Wiethoff]], who also played [[John Marston (Red Dead)|John Marston]] in the game and [[Red Dead Redemption|its predecessor]].\n\nThe character has received acclaim from critics, with his complexity and path to redemption most frequently the subject of praise. Reviewers also lauded the character for bringing the game's world and other characters to life. For his work on the game, Clark received numerous [[List of accolades received by Red Dead Redemption 2|nominations]] and was awarded Best Performance at [[The Game Awards 2018|The Game Awards]].\n\n== Character development ==\nThe development team at [[Rockstar Games]] decided that the player would control one character in ''[[Red Dead Redemption 2]]'', as opposed to the three protagonists in Rockstar's previous title ''[[Grand Theft Auto V]]'' (2013), in order to follow the character more personally and understand how the events impact him.<ref name=\"Variety\"/> They felt that a single character felt more appropriate for the narrative structure of a Western.<ref name=\"THR\"/> Producer Rob Nelson felt that the decision to limit to one protagonist shaped the other creative decisions of development. The conversations and sense of life within the gang environment was inspired by ''Grand Theft Auto V''{{'}}s exploration of the lives of two of the game's playable characters while the player was controlling the other one.<ref name=\"Variety\"/> Rockstar wanted to grant agency to the player when experiencing the story of Arthur Morgan; writer Michael Unsworth noted that Arthur is neither controlled by the storytellers or by the player, but consists of \"a delicate push and pull between the two\".<ref name=\"Variety\"/> The team attempted to give the player more freedom with Arthur's relationship with other characters; when the narrative begins, Arthur has already formed relationships with the other gang members, so the team aimed to develop them in a way for the player to respond appropriately.<ref name=\"VentureBeat\"/>\n\n[[Roger Clark (actor, born 1978)|Roger Clark]] portrayed Arthur in the game. His work was recorded using [[performance capture]], involving simultaneous recording of movement and voice; a small part of his performance was recorded in a voiceover booth.<ref name=\"Shacknews\"/> For his portrayal, Clark took main inspiration from [[Toshiro Mifune]].<ref name=\"THR Cast\"/> He found that Mifune's characters were very stoic while also having a \"crazy\" sense of humor, a complexity he wanted to portray within Arthur.<ref name=\"VG247 Clark\"/> Clark also took inspiration from ''[[The Proposition (2005 film)|The Proposition]]'' (2005) as it involved a similar situation to Arthur's, wherein he is forced to betray some of his loyalties. He watched films such as ''[[High Noon]]'' (1952), as well as the work of [[John Wayne]];<ref name=\"Twinfinite Clark\"/> despite watching the ''[[Dollars Trilogy]]'' (1964\u20131966) he did not take much inspiration from [[Clint Eastwood]]'s portrayal of the [[Man with No Name]], as he felt that Arthur was more talkative.<ref name=\"THR Cast\"/> Clark regularly listened to [[Don Edwards]]' 1993 version of the song {{nowrap|\"[[Coyotes (song)|Coyotes]]\"}} during production for inspiration.<ref name=\"SacAnime\"/>\n\nClark wanted to portray a character that was complex enough for the player to choose his path and still make sense. He initially faced difficulty with this concept, as the high honor performance was different to the low honor, but he reminded himself that Arthur was a complex character who could easily contradict himself.<ref name=\"Twinfinite Clark\"/> He aimed to portray vulnerability with Arthur's ego. Clark felt that Arthur initially resented [[John Marston (Red Dead Redemption)|John Marston]], as he had a family\u2014something Arthur wishes he could have\u2014but as the gang begins to fall apart, Arthur acts to help John, \"try[ing] to do what he wishes he could have done for himself\".<ref name=\"VG247 Clark\"/> Clark looked to [[Rob Wiethoff]]'s portrayal as John in the first game for inspiration with his own performance.<ref name=\"Shacknews\"/> A second love interest for Arthur was cut from the game during development.<ref name=\"Vulture\"/>\n\nVice President of Creativity [[Dan Houser]] was interested in subverting the trope of the protagonist starting as weak and becoming stronger as the story progresses; instead, Arthur is already tough at the beginning of the game, and is \"taken on a more intellectual roller coaster when his world view gets taken apart\".<ref name=\"GQ\"/> Houser felt that the decline of the American frontier has a deep impact on Arthur, noting that the character is \"caught between the nastiness of nature and the brutality of encroaching industrialization in civilization\".<ref name=\"Vulture\"/> Houser avoided meeting Clark on set to avoid hearing his real voice.<ref name=\"GQ\"/>\n\n== Appearances ==\nArthur joined the Van der Linde gang when he was 14-years-old, having lost his parents at a young age, and soon became Dutch's first prot\u00e9g\u00e9.{{sfn|Price|2018|p=355}} Arthur had a son, Isaac, with a waitress named Eliza; he demonstrated regular support for them until they were killed by robbers for a trivial sum of money. Over time, Arthur transformed from a lost cause into Dutch's most dedicated enforcer.{{sfn|Price|2018|p=355}} When the gang is forced into a blizzard, Arthur helps to find supplies and later tracks down John. He helps to rob the train owned by Leviticus Cornwall and, after moving to Horseshoe Overlook, fights against Cornwall's hired guns. After moving to Clemens Point, Arthur becomes involved in conflict between two warring families, the Braithwaites and the Grays. The conflict leads to the death of a gang member and the capture of Jack Marston.\n\nArthur retrieves Jack from the supervision of crime lord Angelo Bronte, and helps retaliate against the backstabbing Bronte who leads them into a trap. Arthur notices Dutch's violent outburst as uncharacteristic of him. In Saint Denis, a failed bank heist forces some members of the gang out of town; they soon shipwreck on Guarma, an island near [[Cuba]], but fight alongside a revolutionary in exchange for a ship back to the mainland. Reuniting with the rest of the gang, Arthur and Sadie resolve to save the captured John, much to the disdain of Dutch. Arthur is soon diagnosed with [[tuberculosis]]. Shocked by the grim reality of his imminent death, Arthur contemplates his decisions and reflects on his morals, led further by his friendship with Native American leader Rains Fall. This drives his desire to protect the remnants of the gang, particularly John and his family. Upon saving John, Arthur reveals his growing doubts about Dutch, unable to accept his leader's growing obsession.\n\nDutch seemingly abandons Arthur to die during an assault on an oil refinery, and leaves John for dead when he is shot during a train robbery. When Dutch ignores Arthur's plea to rescue Abigail from Agent Milton, Arthur disavows the gang. Upon confronting Milton, Arthur discovers that Micah Bell has been betraying the gang. He returns to Dutch to inform him of Micah's betrayal; Dutch turns on Arthur and the newly returned John. When Pinkertons invade the camp, Arthur and John flee. Arthur begs John to return to his family. Arthur is soon ambushed by the vengeful Micah, and Dutch intervenes in their fight. Arthur convinces Dutch to abandon Micah and leave. If the player has high honor, Arthur succumbs to his injuries and disease and dies peacefully while watching the sunrise; if the player has low honor, Micah executes him.\n\n== Reception ==\n[[File:Roger Clark - Great Philadelphia Comic Con.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Roger Clark (actor, born 1978)|Roger Clark]]'s performance as Arthur Morgan received high praise from several [[Video game journalism|gaming publications]] and [[List of accolades received by Red Dead Redemption 2|awards ceremonies]].]]\n\nArthur's character received acclaim. ''[[Giant Bomb]]''{{'}}s Alex Navarro wrote that the characters possess humanity often lacking in other Rockstar games, particularly in the thoughtful portrayal of Arthur's internal conflicts.<ref name=\"Giant Bomb Review\"/> Preston Dozsa of ''CG Magazine'' felt similarly, praising the game's interactivity for the player to craft the journey themselves.<ref name=\"CG Magazine Review\"/> ''LevelSkip''{{'}}s Kyle Atwood called Arthur Morgan a \"character of tragedy and, most importantly, humanity\".<ref name=\"LevelSkip\"/> ''[[Kotaku]]''{{'}}s Kirk Hamilton wrote that Arthur initially seemed unremarkable but became more interesting throughout the game, aided by Clark's performance.<ref name=\"Kotaku Review\"/> ''[[Ars Technica]]''{{'}}s Daniel Starkey felt that, while Arthur's story can be considered \"poignant and memorable\", some will see it as a typical story about a \"'bad man' who isn't necessarily in control\".<ref name=\"Ars Technica Review\"/>\n\n''[[GamesRadar+]]''{{'}}s Tom Power felt that Arthur's story reflects that of a [[Shakespearean tragedy]], with some of the game's characters representing the [[five stages of grief]].<ref name=\"GamesRadar Shakespeare\"/> David Meikleham of GamesRadar+ lauded Arthur's story for being \"nothing short of astonishing\", comparing it to ''[[The Last of Us]]'' (2013).<ref name=\"GamesRadar Review\"/> ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly|EGMNow]]''{{'}}s Nick Plessas found the journey of redemption for Arthur Morgan to be \"far more redeeming\" than John Marston's in ''Red Dead Redemption'', noting that his sins heightened his sympathy for the character.<ref name=\"EGM Review\"/> Javy Gwaltney of ''[[Game Informer]]'' echoed this sentiment, noting that Arthur's arc is a \"fantastic take on ''[[memento mori]]'' and how ruthlessly messy and complex redemption can be\".<ref name=\"Game Informer Better\"/> Though ''[[Zero Punctuation]]''{{'}}s [[Ben \"Yahtzee\" Croshaw]] felt that Arthur was \"generic\", he did find himself to be \"quite shook\" by the ending to Arthur's story as \"possibly the emotional impact, more likely from [[delirium tremens]].\"<ref name=\"ZP Review\"/> Conversely, ''[[Eurogamer]]''{{'}}s Martin Robinson considered Arthur to be less compelling than Marston, leading to a confusing narrative as a result.<ref name=\"Eurogamer Review\"/>\n\nSeveral critics felt that the character brought the game's world to life. ''The Guardian''{{'}}s Paul Walker-Emig noted that Arthur's notebook made him feel \"like a real person with his own inner life, rather than a puppet who does our bidding\".<ref name=\"Guardian Notebooks\"/> Peter Suderman, writing for ''[[The New York Times]]'', found that players \"feel for Arthur Morgan, a bad man with a good heart, because his choices are, in fact, your own\".<ref name=\"NYT Art\"/> Laurence Mozafari of ''[[Digital Spy]]'' felt that Arthur perfectly encapsulated the feeling of the Old West.<ref name=\"Digital Spy Review\"/> ''[[VentureBeat]]''{{'}}s Dean Takahashi praised the Clark's performance for adding to the game's immersion and the character's depth.<ref name=\"VentureBeat Review\"/> Luke Reilly of ''[[IGN]]'' celebrated the life brought into the character, describing his voice as having an \"infectious authenticity\".<ref name=\"IGN Review\"/>\n\nFor his role as Arthur, Clark won Best Performance at [[The Game Awards 2018]],<ref name=\"Game Awards 2018\"/> and was awarded gold from [[PlayStation Blog]];<ref name=\"PS Blog\"/> he also received nominations at the [[15th British Academy Games Awards]],<ref name=\"BAFTA\"/> the [[NAVGTR Awards]],<ref name=\"NAVGTR Nom\"/> and the New York Game Awards.<ref name=\"New York Game Awards\"/> The character of Arthur received nominations at the [[22nd Annual D.I.C.E. Awards]]<ref name=\"DICE Nom\"/> and the Italian Video Game Awards.<ref name=\"Italian Nom\"/>\n\n== References ==\n'''Bibliography'''\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{Citation |title=Red Dead Redemption 2: The Complete Official Guide \u2014 Collector's Edition |editor-last=Price |editor-first=James |publisher=Piggyback |location=United States of America |date=October 2018 }}\n{{refend}}\n'''Notes'''\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<!-- Character development -->\n\n<ref name=\"GQ\">{{cite web |url=https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/red-dead-redemption-2-interview |title=Red Dead Redemption 2: The inside story of the most lifelike video game ever |last=White |first=Sam |work=[[GQ]] |publisher=[[Cond\u00e9 Nast]] |date=October 24, 2018 |accessdate=May 10, 2019 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/78GZGmEoH |archivedate=May 10, 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"SacAnime\">{{cite conference |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifohZGPVBMQ |title=Red Dead Redemption II Cast at SacAnime Summer 2019 |last1=Clark |first1=Roger |authorlink1=Roger Clark (actor, born 1978) |last2=Sloyer |first2=Gabriel |last3=Wiethoff |first3=Rob |authorlink3=Rob Wiethoff |last4=McKenna |first4=Alex |authorlink4=Alex McKenna |last5=Santangeli |first5=Jim |last6=Dobell |first6=Curzon |last7=Blomquist |first7=Peter |last8=Palmer |first8=Steve J. |authorlink8=Steve J.
