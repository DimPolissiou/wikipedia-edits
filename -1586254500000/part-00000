His father was a [[Vicar (Anglicanism)|Church of England vicar]], and the family lived adjacent to the father's church \u2013 first in [[Ormond, Victoria|Ormond]], then later in [[Ashburton, Victoria|Ashburton]].

The band played at parties and school functions, with a repertoire of [[Lou Reed]], [[David Bowie]], [[Roxy Music]], [[Alice Cooper]] and the [[Sensational Alex Harvey Band]], among others. Harvey was also a member of the school choir (conducted by actor [[Norman Kaye]]), and took extracurricular lessons from [[Bruce Clarke (musician)|Bruce Clarke]], the [[jazz guitar]]ist.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mickharvey.com/biography.php|title=Mick Harvey - Biography|website=www.mickharvey.com|accessdate=1 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171115181727/http://www.mickharvey.com/biography.php|archive-date=15 November 2017|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Music career==\n\n===The Birthday Party===\n{{Main|The Birthday Party (band)}}\nAfter their final school year in 1975, the band decided to continue with Pew as bassist. Greatly influenced by the [[punk rock|punk]] explosion of 1976, which saw Australian bands [[The Saints (Australian band)|The Saints]] and [[Radio Birdman]] make their first recordings and tours, [[The Birthday Party (band)#The Boys Next Door|The Boys Next Door]], as Harvey's band was now called, began performing fast, original [[New wave music|new wave]] material.<ref>[https://www.discogs.com/artist/78466-The-Boys-Next-Door Discogs - ''The Boys Next Door'' - Aliases, Members, Discography]</ref> Harvey's guitar style was influenced by [[James Williamson (musician)|James Williamson]] of [[The Stooges]] and [[Paul Weller (singer)|Paul Weller]] of [[The Jam]]. The Boys Next Door regularly played at Melbourne pubs between 1977 and 1980. [[Rowland S. Howard]] joined the band in 1978, bringing with him a chaotic [[audio feedback|feedback]] guitar style.\n\nAfter extensive touring, recordings, and moderate success in Australia, the Boys Next Door relocated to [[London]], England in 1980, and changed their name to The Birthday Party. Harvey's girlfriend Katy Beale followed the band to London. This period was defined by innovative and aggressive music composition, underpinned by Harvey's guitar playing. The band moved to [[West Berlin]], Germany in 1982, but without Calvert; Harvey transitioned from guitar to drums.\n\n===Crime and the City Solution===\n''Main article: [[Crime & the City Solution]]''\n\nAfter the breakup of The Birthday Party while initiating the early recordings of what would become The Bad Seeds with Nick Cave, Harvey contacted his friend [[Simon Bonney]], with whom he reformed Bonney's old Australian band [[Crime & the City Solution]]. Rowland S. Howard, [[Harry Howard (musician)|Harry Howard]] (bass) and Epic Soundtracks (drums), all of whom a few years later would form the basis of [[These Immortal Souls]], also participated. This line-up of the band found its peak and demise with its appearance in the [[Wim Wenders]] film ''[[Wings of Desire]]''. Bonney then stayed in Berlin and formed the next line-up of the band with his partner [[Bronwyn Adams]], Harvey (drums), [[Alexander Hacke]] of [[Einst\u00fcrzende Neubauten]] (guitar), [[Chrislo Haas]] of [[Liaisons Dangereuses (band)|Liaisons Dangereuses]] and DAF (synthesiser) and Thomas Stern (bass). This line-up made three studio albums and toured until 1991.\n\n=== Nick Cave and The Bad Seeds ===\n''Main article: [[Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds]]''\n\nHarvey and Cave formed Nick Cave and The Bad Seeds in 1983. Harvey was principally the drummer on the first 2 albums before line-up changes saw him move to the bass until the arrival of [[Martyn P. Casey]] in 1990 when he moved back to his original instrument, guitar. Throughout the 80s and 90 Harvey was the band member charged with the responsibility for the production of the recordings along with Cave. His arrangement skills also saw him putting together most of the band\u2019s string arrangements during this time and led to the perception of him as a kind of musical director. He also managed much of the band\u2019s business affairs right up until his departure. Harvey remained with the Bad Seeds for 25 years until his last show in Perth, Australia on 20 January 2009, when he cited both professional and personal factors as reasons for leaving.<sup>[5]</sup> Regarding Cave, Harvey informed the media: <blockquote>\nI'm confident Nick [Cave] will continue to be a creative force and that this is the right time to pass on my artistic and managerial role to what has become a tremendous group of people who can support him in his endeavours, both musically and organisationally.<ref name=\"Quit\">{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/01/22/2472215.htm?section=entertainment|title=Bad Seeds co-founder Harvey quits|date=23 January 2009|work=ABC News|accessdate=28 August 2014}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn 2010, Harvey explained further that his frustration with song arrangements strained his relationship with Cave; and a desire to spend time with family was also a significant reason for his decision. The split marked the end of a 36-year-long collaboration between Harvey and Cave.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://meltingpod.free.fr/?p=214|title=Podcast 103 Live interview with Mick Harvey in Paris 2010 : some reasons to have left the band Nick Cave and The Bad Seeds\u2026Part 2 (25\u2032)|author1=Mardi|date=2 March 2010|website=Meltingpod|publisher=Meltingpod|format=Audio file|accessdate=28 August 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== '''Anita Lane''' ===\n''Main article: [[Anita Lane]]''\n\nHarvey worked extensively with Nick Cave\u2019s muse and partner of many years on two albums - ''Dirty Pearl'' (1993) and ''Sex O\u2019Clock'' (2000).\n\n===The Wallbangers===\nIn 2007, the Spanish label [[Bang! Records]] released a four-track [[Extended play|EP]] by Harvey's [[retro]] rock band The Wallbangers, called ''Kick the Drugs'' <ref>[https://www.discogs.com/release/3327901 Discogs - ''Kick the Drugs'' - vinyl 7\", Bang! Records (BANG!-21) Spain]</ref> featuring songs written by Harvey alone, and songs he co-wote with [[Tex Perkins]] and [[Loene Carmen]]. Harvey sings and plays guitars.\n\n===Solo===\nAfter Bonney left Crime & the City Solution for a solo career in the United States, Harvey recorded two solo albums of [[Serge Gainsbourg]] songs, translated from French into English: ''[[Intoxicated Man]]'' (1995) and ''[[Pink Elephants]]'' (1997). He has also collaborated with UK rock musician [[PJ Harvey]] (no relation), and produced for other Australian artists, including [[Anita Lane]], [[Robert Forster (musician)|Robert Forster]], [[Conway Savage]] and Rowland S. Howard. Harvey's third solo release, ''[[One Man's Treasure]]'', was issued in September 2005.\n\nHe undertook his first solo tours of Europe and Australia in 2006, accompanied by fellow Bad Seeds [[Thomas Wydler]] and [[James Johnston (English musician)|James Johnston]], as well as Melbourne-based double bassist Rosie Westbrook. His next solo record, 2007's ''Two of Diamonds'', was recorded with this group, as was the 2008 live album ''Three Sisters \u2013 Live at Bush Hall''.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\nIn February 2008, Harvey and Westbrook played as a support act for PJ Harvey on her Australian tour, with both Harveys also performing on stage together. Prior to the tour, Harvey had worked extensively with PJ Harvey over a 12-year period: he was a recording musician on her albums ''[[To Bring You My Love]]'' and ''[[Is This Desire?]]'', and co-produced the album ''[[Stories from the City, Stories from the Sea]]'' in 2000.<ref>{{cite web|author1=Melbjuz|title=PJ chooses Mick Harvey|url=http://www.fasterlouder.com.au/news/11857/PJ-chooses-Mick-Harvey|website=Faster Louder|publisher=Faster Louder Pty Ltd|accessdate=28 August 2014|date=10 January 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140903173411/http://www.fasterlouder.com.au/news/11857/PJ-chooses-Mick-Harvey|archive-date=3 September 2014|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n[[File:Mickey_Harvey_2012.jpg|thumb|right|Harvey, 2012]]\nIn both 2008 and 2009, he joined the five remaining members of [[The Triffids]] for a series of performances at the [[Sydney Festival]], [[Melbourne Arts Centre]] and [[Perth International Arts Festival]], celebrating the music and the memory of [[David McComb]]. Harvey is also a contributor to the 2009 edited collection, ''Vagabond Holes: David McComb and the Triffids'', edited by Australian academics [[Niall Lucy]] and Chris Coughran.<ref>Niall Lucy and Chris Coughran, eds. Vagabond Holes: David McComb and The Triffids (Fremantle: Fremantle Press, 2009).</ref>\n\nDuring 2008 and 2009 Harvey worked on what would be [[Rowland S. Howard]]\u2019s last album \u2018Pop Crimes\u2019 playing drums with his future close collaborator J.P. Shilo providing bass and violin. The album was released just a few months before Howard succumbed to liver cancer in late 2009.\n\nHarvey released ''Sketches from the Book of the Dead'' \u2014 the first solo album written entirely by himself \u2014 in early 2011 on the Mute record label. The 11-track album was recorded in Melbourne, between a Port Melbourne studio and his own Grace Lane music room. Harvey played most of the instruments, while Westbrook played double bass, J.P. Shilo played accordion, violin and occasional guitar, and Xanthe Waite contributed backing vocals. Harvey explained in a promotional interview that he does not perceive himself as a \"songwriter\" in the traditional sense, whereby the practice is: \"something they [actual songwriters, as perceived by Harvey] have done historically and something they've worked on as central to what they are as an artist\". He also confirmed that the opening track, \"October Boy\", is about Rowland S. Howard.<ref name=\"Ian\">{{cite web|author1=Ian Johnston|title=Mick Harvey \u2013 Exclusive LTW Review/Interview|url=http://louderthanwar.com/mick-harvey-exclusive-ltw-reviewinterview/|website=Louder Than War|publisher=Louder Than War|accessdate=28 August 2014|date=12 April 2011}}</ref>\n\nHarvey once again co-produced and recorded for PJ Harvey during the creation of her eighth studio album, ''[[Let England Shake]]''. The 2011 release was supported by a world tour in the same year, which also included Harvey as a touring musician.<ref name=\"Ian\" />\n\nHis sixth solo studio album, titled ''FOUR (Acts of Love)'', released on Mute in 2013, features original compositions by Mick Harvey alongside a song by PJ Harvey (\"Glorious\") and interpretations of The Saints\u2019 \"The Story of Love\", [[Van Morrison]]\u2019s \"The Way Young Lovers Do\", Exuma\u2019s \"Summertime in New York\" and [[Roy Orbison]]\u2019s \"Wild Hearts (Run Out of Time)\". ''FOUR (Acts of Love)'' was recorded at Grace Lane, North Melbourne and Atlantis Sound, Melbourne, and features regular collaborators Rosie Westbrook on double bass and JP Shilo on guitar and violin.\n\n''Delirium Tremens'' (2016) is the third instalment in Harvey's project of translating [[Serge Gainsbourg]]'s songs into English, after ''Intoxicated Man'' and ''Pink Elephants''. ''Delirium Tremens'' was recorded in Melbourne with Harvey's Antipodean-based core live band. 10 songs were tracked at Birdland Studios; the project then relocated to Berlin, where a further nine songs were recorded with [[Toby Dammit]] ([[The Stooges]], The Residents) and Bertrand Burgalat (of French label Tricatel), who was the string arranger on the first two volumes.\n\nHarvey again collaborated with PJ Harvey in early 2015, playing and singing on her album ''[[The Hope Six Demolition Project]]''. The following year he joined PJ on tour promoting the album, which was released in April 2016.\n\nIn 2018, Harvey released the album ''The Fall And Rise Of Edgar Bourchier And The Horrors Of War'' in collaboration with author [https://eleganthorrors.co.uk Christopher Richard Barker].\n\n==Personal life==\nHarvey divides his time between Europe and Melbourne. He has one son with his partner, Katy Beale, who is a painter. As of 2014, the family resided in the inner-city Melbourne suburb of North Melbourne.<ref name=\"Talk\" />\n\nAs part of his interview with [[Brisbane]] writer [[Andrew McMillen]] for the book ''Talking Smack: Honest Conversations About Drugs'', Harvey concluded with his perspective on illicit drug use:\n\n<blockquote>\nBecause I\u2019ve been so surrounded by [illicit drug use], I've seen a lot of the problems that come with it. But I've also seen a lot of people, as well, who've used in different ways and not had problems. So the point about banning it across the board is that then you remove that freedom of choice of those people, too. I mean, why does alcohol remain available when other things aren't? It's not a great drug, at all.<ref name=\"Talk\">{{cite web|title='Talking Smack: Honest Conversations About Drugs' book launch at Avid Reader, 21 August 2014|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iv5u_-dvdjM|website=Andrew McMillen on YouTube|publisher=Google Inc|accessdate=28 August 2014|format=Video upload|date=21 August 2014}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Discography==\n\n===Solo albums===\n* ''[[Intoxicated Man]]'' (1995)\n* ''[[Pink Elephants]]'' (1997)\n* ''[[One Man's Treasure]]'' (2005)\n* ''[[Two of Diamonds (album)|Two of Diamonds]]'' (2007)\n* ''Three Sisters \u2013 Live at Bush Hall'' (2008)\n* ''[[Sketches from the Book of the Dead]]'' (2011)\n* ''[[Four (Acts of Love)|Four]]'' (2013)\n* ''[[Delirium_Tremens_(Mick_Harvey_Album)|Delirium Tremens]]'' (2016)\n* ''[[Intoxicated Women]]'' (2017)\n* ''[[The Fall And Rise Of Edgar Bourchier And The Horrors Of War]]'' (2018)\n\n===Film soundtracks===\n* ''The Road To God Knows Where'' & ''Live at the Paradiso'' (1989, together with Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds), directed by [[Uli M Schueppel]]\n* ''[[Ghosts... of the Civil Dead]]'' (1990) \n* ''Vaterland'' (1992, together with [[Alexander Hacke]]), directed by Uli M Schueppel\n* ''Alta Marea & Vaterland'' (1993)\n* ''[[To Have & to Hold (film)|To Have & to Hold]]'' (1996) \n* ''[[Chopper (film)|Chopper]]'' (2000)\n* ''Planet Alex'' (2000, together with Alexander Hacke), directed by Uli M Schueppel\n* ''[[Australian Rules (film)|Australian Rules]]'' (2003)\n* ''[[Suburban Mayhem]]'' (2006) \n* ''Deliver Us from Evil'' (2006)\n* ''Motion Picture Music'' (2006)\n\n===Other CD releases===\n* ''[[And The Ass Saw The Angel]]'' (2000)\n\n===Albums produced for other artists===\n* [[Robert Forster (musician)|Robert Forster]], ''Danger in the Past'' (1990)\n* Once Upon A Time, ''In The Blink of an Eye'' (1992)\n* [[Anita Lane]], ''Dirty Pearl'' (1993)\n* [[The Cruel Sea (band)|The Cruel Sea]], ''[[The Honeymoon Is Over (album)|The Honeymoon Is Over]]'' (1993) (co-producer) (AUS No. 4, also [[ARIA award]] for \"Best Album\" 1994)\n* [[Congo Norvell]], ''Music To Remember Him By'' (1994)\n* [[PJ Harvey]], ''[[Dance Hall at Louse Point]]'' (1996, co-producer)\n* [[Rowland S.

Rowland S. Howard, [[Harry Howard (musician)|Harry Howard]] (bass) and Epic Soundtracks (drums), all of whom a few years later would form the basis of [[These Immortal Souls]], also participated. This line-up of the band found its peak and demise with its appearance in the [[Wim Wenders]] film ''[[Wings of Desire]]''. Bonney then stayed in Berlin and formed the next line-up of the band with his partner [[Bronwyn Adams]], Harvey (drums), [[Alexander Hacke]] of [[Einst\u00fcrzende Neubauten]] (guitar), [[Chrislo Haas]] of [[Liaisons Dangereuses (band)|Liaisons Dangereuses]] and DAF (synthesiser) and Thomas Stern (bass). This line-up made three studio albums and toured until 1991.\n\n=== Nick Cave and The Bad Seeds ===\n''Main article: [[Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds]]''\n\nHarvey and Cave formed Nick Cave and The Bad Seeds in 1983. Harvey was principally the drummer on the first 2 albums before line-up changes saw him move to the bass until the arrival of [[Martyn P. Casey]] in 1990 when he moved back to his original instrument, guitar. Throughout the 80s and 90 Harvey was the band member charged with the responsibility for the production of the recordings along with Cave. His arrangement skills also saw him putting together most of the band\u2019s string arrangements during this time and led to the perception of him as a kind of musical director. He also managed much of the band\u2019s business affairs right up until his departure. Harvey remained with the Bad Seeds for 25 years until his last show in Perth, Australia on 20 January 2009, when he cited both professional and personal factors as reasons for leaving.<sup>[5]</sup> Regarding Cave, Harvey informed the media: <blockquote>\nI'm confident Nick [Cave] will continue to be a creative force and that this is the right time to pass on my artistic and managerial role to what has become a tremendous group of people who can support him in his endeavours, both musically and organisationally.<ref name=\"Quit\">{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/01/22/2472215.htm?section=entertainment|title=Bad Seeds co-founder Harvey quits|date=23 January 2009|work=ABC News|accessdate=28 August 2014}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn 2010, Harvey explained further that his frustration with song arrangements strained his relationship with Cave; and a desire to spend time with family was also a significant reason for his decision. The split marked the end of a 36-year-long collaboration between Harvey and Cave.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://meltingpod.free.fr/?p=214|title=Podcast 103 Live interview with Mick Harvey in Paris 2010 : some reasons to have left the band Nick Cave and The Bad Seeds\u2026Part 2 (25\u2032)|author1=Mardi|date=2 March 2010|website=Meltingpod|publisher=Meltingpod|format=Audio file|accessdate=28 August 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== '''Anita Lane''' ===\n''Main article: [[Anita Lane]]''\n\nHarvey worked extensively with Nick Cave\u2019s muse and partner of many years on two albums - Dirty Pearl (1993 ) and Sex O\u2019Clock (200)\n\n===The Wallbangers===\nIn 2007, the Spanish label [[Bang! Records]] released a four-track [[Extended play|EP]] by Harvey's [[retro]] rock band The Wallbangers, called ''Kick the Drugs'' <ref>[https://www.discogs.com/release/3327901 Discogs - ''Kick the Drugs'' - vinyl 7\", Bang! Records (BANG!-21) Spain]</ref> featuring songs written by Harvey alone, and songs he co-wote with [[Tex Perkins]] and [[Loene Carmen]]. Harvey sings and plays guitars.\n\n===Solo===\nAfter Bonney left Crime & the City Solution for a solo career in the United States, Harvey recorded two solo albums of [[Serge Gainsbourg]] songs, translated from French into English: ''[[Intoxicated Man]]'' (1995) and ''[[Pink Elephants]]'' (1997). He has also collaborated with UK rock musician [[PJ Harvey]] (no relation), and produced for other Australian artists, including [[Anita Lane]], [[Robert Forster (musician)|Robert Forster]], [[Conway Savage]] and Rowland S. Howard. Harvey's third solo release, ''[[One Man's Treasure]]'', was issued in September 2005.\n\nHe undertook his first solo tours of Europe and Australia in 2006, accompanied by fellow Bad Seeds [[Thomas Wydler]] and [[James Johnston (English musician)|James Johnston]], as well as Melbourne-based double bassist Rosie Westbrook. His next solo record, 2007's ''Two of Diamonds'', was recorded with this group, as was the 2008 live album ''Three Sisters \u2013 Live at Bush Hall''.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\nIn February 2008, Harvey and Westbrook played as a support act for PJ Harvey on her Australian tour, with both Harveys also performing on stage together. Prior to the tour, Harvey had worked extensively with PJ Harvey over a 12-year period: he was a recording musician on her albums ''[[To Bring You My Love]]'' and ''[[Is This Desire?]]'', and co-produced the album ''[[Stories from the City, Stories from the Sea]]'' in 2000.<ref>{{cite web|author1=Melbjuz|title=PJ chooses Mick Harvey|url=http://www.fasterlouder.com.au/news/11857/PJ-chooses-Mick-Harvey|website=Faster Louder|publisher=Faster Louder Pty Ltd|accessdate=28 August 2014|date=10 January 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140903173411/http://www.fasterlouder.com.au/news/11857/PJ-chooses-Mick-Harvey|archive-date=3 September 2014|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n[[File:Mickey_Harvey_2012.jpg|thumb|right|Harvey, 2012]]\nIn both 2008 and 2009, he joined the five remaining members of [[The Triffids]] for a series of performances at the [[Sydney Festival]], [[Melbourne Arts Centre]] and [[Perth International Arts Festival]], celebrating the music and the memory of [[David McComb]]. Harvey is also a contributor to the 2009 edited collection, ''Vagabond Holes: David McComb and the Triffids'', edited by Australian academics [[Niall Lucy]] and Chris Coughran.<ref>Niall Lucy and Chris Coughran, eds. Vagabond Holes: David McComb and The Triffids (Fremantle: Fremantle Press, 2009).</ref>\n\nDuring 2008 and 2009 Harvey worked on what would be [[Rowland S. Howard]]\u2019s last album \u2018Pop Crimes\u2019 playing drums with his future close collaborator J.P. Shilo providing bass and violin. The album was released just a few months before Howard succumbed to liver cancer in late 2009.\n\nHarvey released ''Sketches from the Book of the Dead'' \u2014 the first solo album written entirely by himself \u2014 in early 2011 on the Mute record label. The 11-track album was recorded in Melbourne, between a Port Melbourne studio and his own Grace Lane music room. Harvey played most of the instruments, while Westbrook played double bass, J.P. Shilo played accordion, violin and occasional guitar, and Xanthe Waite contributed backing vocals. Harvey explained in a promotional interview that he does not perceive himself as a \"songwriter\" in the traditional sense, whereby the practice is: \"something they [actual songwriters, as perceived by Harvey] have done historically and something they've worked on as central to what they are as an artist\". He also confirmed that the opening track, \"October Boy\", is about Rowland S. Howard.<ref name=\"Ian\">{{cite web|author1=Ian Johnston|title=Mick Harvey \u2013 Exclusive LTW Review/Interview|url=http://louderthanwar.com/mick-harvey-exclusive-ltw-reviewinterview/|website=Louder Than War|publisher=Louder Than War|accessdate=28 August 2014|date=12 April 2011}}</ref>\n\nHarvey once again co-produced and recorded for PJ Harvey during the creation of her eighth studio album, ''[[Let England Shake]]''. The 2011 release was supported by a world tour in the same year, which also included Harvey as a touring musician.<ref name=\"Ian\" />\n\nHis sixth solo studio album, titled ''FOUR (Acts of Love)'', released on Mute in 2013, features original compositions by Mick Harvey alongside a song by PJ Harvey (\"Glorious\") and interpretations of The Saints\u2019 \"The Story of Love\", [[Van Morrison]]\u2019s \"The Way Young Lovers Do\", Exuma\u2019s \"Summertime in New York\" and [[Roy Orbison]]\u2019s \"Wild Hearts (Run Out of Time)\". ''FOUR (Acts of Love)'' was recorded at Grace Lane, North Melbourne and Atlantis Sound, Melbourne, and features regular collaborators Rosie Westbrook on double bass and JP Shilo on guitar and violin.\n\n''Delirium Tremens'' (2016) is the third instalment in Harvey's project of translating [[Serge Gainsbourg]]'s songs into English, after ''Intoxicated Man'' and ''Pink Elephants''. ''Delirium Tremens'' was recorded in Melbourne with Harvey's Antipodean-based core live band. 10 songs were tracked at Birdland Studios; the project then relocated to Berlin, where a further nine songs were recorded with [[Toby Dammit]] ([[The Stooges]], The Residents) and Bertrand Burgalat (of French label Tricatel), who was the string arranger on the first two volumes.\n\nHarvey again collaborated with PJ Harvey in early 2015, playing and singing on her album ''[[The Hope Six Demolition Project]]''. The following year he joined PJ on tour promoting the album, which was released in April 2016.\n\nIn 2018, Harvey released the album ''The Fall And Rise Of Edgar Bourchier And The Horrors Of War'' in collaboration with author [https://eleganthorrors.co.uk Christopher Richard Barker].\n\n==Personal life==\nHarvey divides his time between Europe and Melbourne. He has one son with his partner, Katy Beale, who is a painter. As of 2014, the family resided in the inner-city Melbourne suburb of North Melbourne.<ref name=\"Talk\" />\n\nAs part of his interview with [[Brisbane]] writer [[Andrew McMillen]] for the book ''Talking Smack: Honest Conversations About Drugs'', Harvey concluded with his perspective on illicit drug use:\n\n<blockquote>\nBecause I\u2019ve been so surrounded by [illicit drug use], I've seen a lot of the problems that come with it. But I've also seen a lot of people, as well, who've used in different ways and not had problems. So the point about banning it across the board is that then you remove that freedom of choice of those people, too. I mean, why does alcohol remain available when other things aren't? It's not a great drug, at all.<ref name=\"Talk\">{{cite web|title='Talking Smack: Honest Conversations About Drugs' book launch at Avid Reader, 21 August 2014|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iv5u_-dvdjM|website=Andrew McMillen on YouTube|publisher=Google Inc|accessdate=28 August 2014|format=Video upload|date=21 August 2014}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Discography==\n\n===Solo albums===\n* ''[[Intoxicated Man]]'' (1995)\n* ''[[Pink Elephants]]'' (1997)\n* ''[[One Man's Treasure]]'' (2005)\n* ''[[Two of Diamonds (album)|Two of Diamonds]]'' (2007)\n* ''Three Sisters \u2013 Live at Bush Hall'' (2008)\n* ''[[Sketches from the Book of the Dead]]'' (2011)\n* ''[[Four (Acts of Love)|Four]]'' (2013)\n* ''[[Delirium_Tremens_(Mick_Harvey_Album)|Delirium Tremens]]'' (2016)\n* ''[[Intoxicated Women]]'' (2017)\n* ''[[The Fall And Rise Of Edgar Bourchier And The Horrors Of War]]'' (2018)\n\n===Film soundtracks===\n* ''The Road To God Knows Where'' & ''Live at the Paradiso'' (1989, together with Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds), directed by [[Uli M Schueppel]]\n* ''[[Ghosts... of the Civil Dead]]'' (1990) \n* ''Vaterland'' (1992, together with [[Alexander Hacke]]), directed by Uli M Schueppel\n* ''Alta Marea & Vaterland'' (1993)\n* ''[[To Have & to Hold (film)|To Have & to Hold]]'' (1996) \n* ''[[Chopper (film)|Chopper]]'' (2000)\n* ''Planet Alex'' (2000, together with Alexander Hacke), directed by Uli M Schueppel\n* ''[[Australian Rules (film)|Australian Rules]]'' (2003)\n* ''[[Suburban Mayhem]]'' (2006) \n* ''Deliver Us from Evil'' (2006)\n* ''Motion Picture Music'' (2006)\n\n===Other CD releases===\n* ''[[And The Ass Saw The Angel]]'' (2000)\n\n===Albums produced for other artists===\n* [[Robert Forster (musician)|Robert Forster]], ''Danger in the Past'' (1990)\n* Once Upon A Time, ''In The Blink of an Eye'' (1992)\n* [[Anita Lane]], ''Dirty Pearl'' (1993)\n* [[The Cruel Sea (band)|The Cruel Sea]], ''[[The Honeymoon Is Over (album)|The Honeymoon Is Over]]'' (1993) (co-producer) (AUS No. 4, also [[ARIA award]] for \"Best Album\" 1994)\n* [[Congo Norvell]], ''Music To Remember Him By'' (1994)\n* [[PJ Harvey]], ''[[Dance Hall at Louse Point]]'' (1996, co-producer)\n* [[Rowland S.

It is the first spinosaurid reported from Asia is confidently known only from tooth [[Fossil|fossils]]; the first of which were found in the [[Sao Khua Formation]], with more teeth later recovered from the younger [[Khok Kruat Formation]]. The [[type species]] '''''Siamosaurus suteethorni''''', whose name honours Thai [[palaeontologist]] [[Varavudh Suteethorn]], was formally described in [[1986 in paleontology|1986]]. One possible ''Siamosaurus'' tooth was discovered in the Japanese [[Sebayashi Formation]] in 1994, and a tooth similar to it was found at the same site in 2015. In 2009, four teeth from China's [[Xinlong Formation]] were assigned to the spinosaurid species '''''\"Sinopliosaurus\" fusuiensis''''', which may be the same animal as ''Siamosaurus''. Two partial spinosaurid skeletons have been found in Thailand, one in the Sao Khua and the other in the Khok Kruat Formation, but whether they belong to ''Siamosaurus'' or not is unclear.\n\nThe [[holotype]] tooth is {{Convert|62.5|mm|}} long and {{Convert|16.6 by 12.5|mm|}} wide at the base. Since it is a tooth taxon, ''Siamosaurus''{{'}}s body size and weight are uncertain, though it has been estimated at between {{Convert|5.1 to 9.1|m||abbr=}} and weighing {{Convert|1|tonne|short ton}}. ''Siamosaurus''<nowiki/>'s teeth were straight, oval to circular in cross section, and lined with distinct lengthwise ridges. The tooth's [[Tooth enamel|enamel]] was wrinkled, similar to that of teeth from the related genus ''[[Baryonyx]]''. ''Siamosaurus''{{'}}s identity has been questioned by many palaeontologists, who argue that its teeth are too similar to those of contemporaneous aquatic reptiles for it to be confidently classed as a dinosaur. Other researchers, who agree that the teeth are spinosaur in origin, deem them too similar to those of other Early Cretaceous spinosaurs to unequivocally raise a new genus. Based on characteristics of their teeth, ''Siamosaurus'' and ''\"Sinopliosaurus\" fusuiensis'' have been placed in the [[Spinosaurinae]] [[subfamily]].\n\nLike all spinosaurids, ''Siamosaurus''{{'}}s teeth were conical, with reduced or absent [[Serration|serrations]]. This made them suitable for impaling rather than tearing flesh, a trait typically seen in largely [[piscivorous]] (fish-eating) animals. Its relatives are known to have also consumed [[Pterosaur|pterosaurs]] and small to medium-sized dinosaurs, and there is fossil evidence of ''Siamosaurus'' eating [[Sauropoda|sauropod]] dinosaurs, either via scavenging or hunting. ''Siamosaurus'' lived in a [[Semi-arid climate|semi-arid]] habitat of [[Floodplain|floodplains]] and meandering rivers, where it coexisted with other theropod, sauropod, and (in at least the Khok Kruat Formation) [[Iguanodontia|iguanodontian]] dinosaurs. [[Isotope analysis]] indicates spinosaurids may have had [[semiaquatic]] habits, and ''Siamosaurus''<nowiki/>'s role as a piscivorous predator might have reduced the prominence of contemporaneous [[Crocodilia|crocodilians]] competing for the same food source.\n\n== History of discovery ==\n[[File:Cretaceous_strata_in_northeast_and_southeastern_Thailand.png|thumb|left|Geological map of the [[Khorat Plateau]] in northeast Thailand]]\n\nThe [[Sao Khua Formation]], where the first ''Siamosaurus'' [[Fossil|fossils]] were discovered, is part of the [[Khorat Group]].<ref name=\":0\">Buffetaut, E.; and Ingevat, R.

Features shared between the two specimens include: a straight and only slightly compressed shape; a somewhat oval cross section; no serrations on the carinae (possibly due to bad preservation); and a flutes on the crown surface, the Japan specimen having 12 on each side. The specimens also share a crown surface with numerous small granular structures oriented parallel to their lengths. Because of these resemblances, Hasegawa and colleagues regarded GMNH-PV-999 as nearly identical to DMR TF 2043a.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n[[File:Sebayashi_spinosaurid_teeth.png|thumb|left|Partial tooth of an indeterminate spinosaurid (KDC-PV-0003) and possible ''Siamosaurus'' tooth (GMNH-PV-999), in the [[National Museum of Nature and Science]], Tokyo]]\n\nKDC-PV-0003, the second tooth found in the Sebayashi Formation, consists of a slightly recurved crown fragment with a preserved length of {{Convert|10|mm|}}. At its base, the crown is {{Convert|7.4|mm|}} long and {{Convert|6.8|mm|}} wide, with an almost circular cross section. Though less complete than the former specimens, KDC-PV-0003 exhibits better preservation of small details such as visible serrations, although poorly defined ones.

The granular structures of KDC-PV-0003 are sharper than in GMNH-PV-999.

The front and rear carinae are distinct, though their serrations have been heavily eroded, similar to those of KDC-PV-0003. Like the Thailand and Japan teeth, the ''\"Sinopliosaurus\" fusuiensis'' specimens bear developed flutes and a granular surface. As in both Sebayashi Formation teeth, there are 12 flutes on each face of ''\"Sinopliosaurus\" fusuiensis''{{'}}s teeth. Like in KDC-PV-0003, these flutes are of varied lengths. Buffetaut and colleagues likened the ''\"Sinopliosaurus\" fusuiensis'' teeth most to those of ''Siamosaurus'', given their identical crown shape, fluting, and granular enamel.<ref name=\"EBetal082\" />\n\nOf the two Khok Kruat Formation tooth morphotypes described by Kamonlak and colleagues in 2019, morphotype I, the Khok Kruat morphotype, is on average {{Convert|46.35|mm||abbr=}} in total length, of which the crown takes up {{Convert|43.77|mm||abbr=}}, with a {{Convert|18.40 by 13.5|mm||abbr=}} wide base.

Stoppani, [[Lombardy]]]]\n\nIn 1986, Buffetaut and Ingavat classified ''Siamosaurus'' as a theropod because of the straight tall crown and double lateral recurvature of its teeth. At the time, ''Siamosaurus''{{'}}s particular combination of dental characteristics, especially the longitudinal fluting and lack of serrations, had not been observed in other theropods. The authors noted similarities in ''Siamosaurus''{{'}}s teeth to those of [[Ceratosauria|ceratosaurian]] tooth crowns, some of which also have longitudinal flutes. However, this identification was ruled out, since ceratosaur teeth differ in cross section, bear far fewer dental flutes, and have distinct serrations. Buffetaut and Suteethorn concluded that the closest taxon in dentition to ''Siamosaurus'' was ''Spinosaurus''. Like ''Siamosaurus,'' this African genus had straight and unserrated conical teeth, and though ''Spinosaurus'' lacked the developed flutes seen in ''Siamosaurus,'' Buffetaut and Ingavat noted that both smooth and fluted spinosaur teeth have been reported from Africa.

Isotope ratios of spinosaurid teeth from various localities, including Thailand and China, were compared with isotopic compositions from contemporaneous theropods, turtles, and crocodilians. The study revealed that, among theropods, spinosaurid isotope ratios were closer to those of turtles and crocodilians. Thai spinosaurid teeth tended to have the largest difference from the ratios of other theropods, and those from Morocco tended to have the least difference. The authors concluded that spinosaurids, like modern crocodilians and hippopotamuses, spent much of their daily lives in or near water. They also suggested that semiaquatic habits and piscivory may explain how spinosaurids coexisted with other large theropods; by feeding on different prey items and occupying a distinct ecological niche, the different types of theropods would have been out of direct competition.<ref name=\":21\" /><ref name=\"RMetal10\">{{cite journal |last=Amiot |first=R. |author2=Buffetaut, E. |author3=L\u00e9cuyer, C. |author4=Wang, X. |author5=Boudad, L. |author6=Ding, Z. |author7=Fourel, F. |author8=Hutt, S. |author9=Martineau, F. |author10=Medeiros, A. |author11=Mo, J. |author12=Simon, L. |author13=Suteethorn, V. |author14=Sweetman, S. |author15=Tong, H. |author16=Zhang, F. |author17=Zhou, Z. |year=2010 |title=Oxygen isotope evidence for semi-aquatic habits among spinosaurid theropods |journal=Geology |volume=38 |issue=2 |pages=139\u2013142 |doi=10.1130/G30402.1|bibcode=2010Geo....38..139A }}</ref>\n\n== Palaeoenvironment and palaeobiogeography ==\n[[File:Sao_Khua_Formation_V2.png|thumb|left|Restoration of ''Siamosaurus'' hunting fish in the Sao Khua Formation, with a herd of ''[[Phuwiangosaurus]]'' in the background]]\n\nThe sediments of the Sao Khua Formation, composed of [[Red clay|red clays]], [[Mudstone|mudstones]], [[Sandstone|sandstones]], [[Siltstone|siltstones]] and [[Conglomerate (geology)|conglomerate]] rocks, record a [[fluvial]] environment dominated by lakes, [[Floodplain|floodplains]], and meandering low-energy rivers.<ref name=\":12\" /><ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Eric|first=Buffetaut|last2=Varavudh|first2=Suteethorn|date=1998|title=The biogeographical significance of the Mesozoic vertebrates from Thailand|url=http://doc.rero.ch/record/15441|journal=Biogeography and Geological Evolution of SE Asia|language=en}}</ref> This is consistent with the types of vertebrate fauna present in the formation, which comprise only terrestrial or freshwater animals, including dinosaurs, turtles, freshwater [[hybodont sharks]] and [[Actinopterygii|actinopterygian]] fishes, and the freshwater crocodilian ''[[Sunosuchus]]''.<ref name=\":1\" /> Besides ''Siamosaurus'', there were dinosaurs like the [[Metriacanthosauridae|metriacanthosaurid]] ''Siamotyrannus isanensis'',<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Carrano|first1=M.

It is the first spinosaurid reported from Asia is confidently known only from tooth [[Fossil|fossils]]; the first of which were found in the [[Sao Khua Formation]], with more teeth later recovered from the younger [[Khok Kruat Formation]]. The [[type species]] '''''Siamosaurus suteethorni''''', whose name honours Thai [[palaeontologist]] [[Varavudh Suteethorn]], was formally described in [[1986 in paleontology|1986]]. One possible ''Siamosaurus'' tooth was discovered in the Japanese [[Sebayashi Formation]] in 1994, and a tooth similar to it was found at the same site in 2015. In 2009, four teeth from China's [[Xinlong Formation]] were assigned to the spinosaurid species '''''\"Sinopliosaurus\" fusuiensis''''', which may be the same animal as ''Siamosaurus''. Two partial spinosaurid skeletons have been found in Thailand, one in the Sao Khua and the other in the Khok Kruat Formation, but whether they belong to ''Siamosaurus'' or not is unclear.\n\nThe [[holotype]] tooth is {{Convert|62.5|mm|}} long and {{Convert|16.6 by 12.5|mm|}} wide at the base. Since it is a tooth taxon, ''Siamosaurus''{{'}}s body size and weight are uncertain, though it has been estimated at between {{Convert|5.1 to 9.1|m||abbr=}} and weighing {{Convert|1|tonne|short ton}}. ''Siamosaurus''<nowiki/>'s teeth were straight, oval to circular in cross section, and lined with distinct lengthwise ridges. The tooth's [[Tooth enamel|enamel]] was wrinkled, similar to that of teeth from the related genus ''[[Baryonyx]]''. ''Siamosaurus''{{'}}s identity has been questioned by many palaeontologists, who argue that its teeth are too similar to those of contemporaneous aquatic reptiles for it to be confidently classed as a dinosaur. Other researchers, who agree that the teeth are spinosaur in origin, deem them too similar to those of other Early Cretaceous spinosaurs to unequivocally raise a new genus. Based on characteristics of their teeth, ''Siamosaurus'' and ''\"Sinopliosaurus\" fusuiensis'' have been placed in the [[Spinosaurinae]] [[subfamily]].\n\nLike all spinosaurids, ''Siamosaurus''{{'}}s teeth were conical, with reduced or absent [[Serration|serrations]]. This made them suitable for impaling rather than tearing flesh, a trait typically seen in largely [[piscivorous]] (fish-eating) animals. Its relatives are known to have also consumed [[Pterosaur|pterosaurs]] and small to medium-sized dinosaurs, and there is fossil evidence of ''Siamosaurus'' eating [[Sauropoda|sauropod]] dinosaurs, either via scavenging or hunting. ''Siamosaurus'' lived in a [[Semi-arid climate|semi-arid]] habitat of [[Floodplain|floodplains]] and meandering rivers, where it coexisted with other theropod, sauropod, and (in at least the Khok Kruat Formation) [[Iguanodontia|iguanodontian]] dinosaurs. [[Isotope analysis]] indicates spinosaurids may have had [[semiaquatic]] habits, and ''Siamosaurus''<nowiki/>'s role as a piscivorous predator might have reduced the prominence of contemporaneous [[Crocodilia|crocodilians]] competing for the same food source.\n\n== History of discovery ==\n[[File:Cretaceous_strata_in_northeast_and_southeastern_Thailand.png|thumb|left|Geological map of the [[Khorat Plateau]] in northeast Thailand]]\n\nThe [[Sao Khua Formation]], where the first ''Siamosaurus'' [[Fossil|fossils]] were discovered, is part of the [[Khorat Group]].<ref name=\":0\">Buffetaut, E.; and Ingevat, R.

The tooth is relatively straight, with only minor front to back curvature. It is oval in cross section while other specimens are nearly circular in this aspect.

The tooth's front and back carinae are well-defined, though the former is not well preserved. Besides having a broader, {{Convert|20 by 14|mm||adj=on}} wide base and being slightly smaller at {{Convert|51|mm|}} in length, GMNH-PV-999 has a very similar morphology to the ''Siamosaurus suteethorni'' holotype. Features shared between the two specimens include: a straight and only slightly compressed shape; a somewhat oval cross section; no serrations on the carinae (possibly due to bad preservation); and a flutes on the crown surface, the Japan specimen having 12 on each side. The specimens also share a crown surface with numerous small granular structures oriented parallel to their lengths. Because of these resemblances, Hasegawa and colleagues regarded GMNH-PV-999 as nearly identical to DMR TF 2043a.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n[[File:Sebayashi_spinosaurid_teeth.png|thumb|left|Partial tooth of an indeterminate spinosaurid (KDC-PV-0003) and possible ''Siamosaurus'' tooth (GMNH-PV-999), in the [[National Museum of Nature and Science]], Tokyo]]\n\nKDC-PV-0003, the second tooth found in the Sebayashi Formation, consists of a slightly recurved crown fragment with a preserved length of {{Convert|10|mm|}}. At its base, the crown is {{Convert|7.4|mm|}} long and {{Convert|6.8|mm|}} wide, with an almost circular cross section. Though less complete than the former specimens, KDC-PV-0003 exhibits better preservation of small details such as visible serrations, although poorly defined ones. The denticles, of which there are two to three every {{Convert|1|mm||adj=on}}, are visible only on the front carinae, due to the rear of the tooth being obscured by rock [[Matrix (geology)|matrix]]. A {{Convert|5.5|mm||adj=on}} long gap at the fossil's base exposes the dentine, which is covered in a {{Convert|1.6|mm||adj=on}} thick layer of enamel. The little that is preserved of KDC-PV-0003 shows that like the first Sebayashi Formation tooth, it has a granular texture and a minimum of 12 flutes on its surface, not all of which stretch to the full length of the crown. The granular structures of KDC-PV-0003 are sharper than in GMNH-PV-999. The interdenticle sulci (tiny furrows near the gaps between each denticle) of KDC-PV-0003 have an [[Oblique angle|oblique]] orientation of 45 degrees, exactly like those seen in GMNH-PV-999.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nOut of the four teeth referred to ''\"Sinopliosaurus\" fusuiensis'', specimen [[IVPP]] V 4793 is the most intact, although still somewhat deformed.

The front and rear carinae are distinct, though their serrations have been heavily eroded, similar to those of KDC-PV-0003. Like the Thailand and Japan teeth, the ''\"Sinopliosaurus\" fusuiensis'' specimens bear developed flutes and a granular surface. As in both Sebayashi Formation teeth, there are 12 flutes on each face of ''\"Sinopliosaurus\" fusuiensis''{{'}}s teeth. Like in KDC-PV-0003, these flutes are of varied lengths. Buffetaut and colleagues likened the ''\"Sinopliosaurus\" fusuiensis'' teeth most to those of ''Siamosaurus'', given their identical crown shape, fluting, and granular enamel.<ref name=\"EBetal082\" />\n\nOf the two Khok Kruat Formation tooth morphotypes described by Kamonlak and colleagues in 2019, morphotype I, the Khok Kruat morphotype, is on average {{Convert|46.35|mm||abbr=}} in total length, of which the crown takes up {{Convert|43.77|mm||abbr=}}, with a {{Convert|18.40 by 13.5|mm||abbr=}} wide base.

They are also oval in cross section and have distinct carinae, but unlike the Khok Kruat morphotype, the entire length of the crown has wrinkled enamel, and the flutes are coarser and fewer in number, with 11 to 16 on each side. The ''Siamosaurus'' morphotype also shares with ''Siamosaurus suteethorni'', GMNH-PV-999, and IVPP V 4793 a wrinkled enamel surface, and between 12 to 15 flutes on each side.''<ref name=\":24\" />''\n\n== Classification ==\n[[File:Spinosaurus_sp_Marocco_Cenom.JPG|thumb|Tooth of the related genus ''[[Spinosaurus]]'', Museo di Storia Naturale A. Stoppani, [[Lombardy]]]]\n\nIn 1986, Buffetaut and Ingavat classified ''Siamosaurus'' as a theropod because of the straight tall crown and double lateral recurvature of its teeth. At the time, ''Siamosaurus''{{'}}s particular combination of dental characteristics, especially the longitudinal fluting and lack of serrations, had not been observed in other theropods. The authors noted similarities in ''Siamosaurus''{{'}}s teeth to those of [[Ceratosauria|ceratosaurian]] tooth crowns, some of which also have longitudinal flutes. However, this identification was ruled out, since ceratosaur teeth differ in cross section, bear far fewer dental flutes, and have distinct serrations. Buffetaut and Suteethorn concluded that the closest taxon in dentition to ''Siamosaurus'' was ''Spinosaurus''. Like ''Siamosaurus,'' this African genus had straight and unserrated conical teeth, and though ''Spinosaurus'' lacked the developed flutes seen in ''Siamosaurus,'' Buffetaut and Ingavat noted that both smooth and fluted spinosaur teeth have been reported from Africa.

In this study, the teeth of ''Siamosaurus'' and a Morrocan spinosaurid were compared to those of crocodilians using [[Scanning electron microscope|scanning electron microscopy]]. Lauprasert found that spinosaurids and crocodilians may have employed similar feeding tactics and been under comparable [[Constraint (classical mechanics)|mechanical constraints]], based on resemblances in the [[microstructure]] of their tooth enamel. Lauprasert suggested that ''Siamosaurus'' could have therefore replaced the [[ecological niche]] of contemporaneous long-snouted crocodilians as a piscivorous predator. He notes that this likely occurred in correlation with the rising aridity of the Sao Khua and Khok Kruat Formations during the Early Cretaceous, since ''Siamosaurus'' had better mobility in a dry environment than crocodilians did. This could explain the absence of long-snouted crocodilian fossils from that time and place.<ref name=\":11\">{{Cite thesis|last=Lauprasert|first=Komsorn|title=Evolution and palaeoecology of crocodiles in the mesozoic of Khorat plateau, Thailand|date=2006|publisher=Chulalongkorn University|url=https://cuir.car.chula.ac.th/handle/123456789/14411|language=en}}</ref> A similar scenario was proposed for spinosaurids by Hone and colleagues in 2010, who noted that compared to large crocodilians and obligate aquatic predators, they could more easily travel from one body of water to another in search for prey.<ref name=\":19\" />\n\n=== Aquatic habits ===\n\nA 2010 publication by French palaeontologist Romain Amiot and colleagues found that the [[isotopes of oxygen|oxygen isotope]] ratios of spinosaurid bones indicated [[semiaquatic]] lifestyles. Isotope ratios of spinosaurid teeth from various localities, including Thailand and China, were compared with isotopic compositions from contemporaneous theropods, turtles, and crocodilians. The study revealed that, among theropods, spinosaurid isotope ratios were closer to those of turtles and crocodilians. Thai spinosaurid teeth tended to have the largest difference from the ratios of other theropods, and those from Morocco tended to have the least difference. The authors concluded that spinosaurids, like modern crocodilians and hippopotamuses, spent much of their daily lives in or near water. They also suggested that semiaquatic habits and piscivory may explain how spinosaurids coexisted with other large theropods; by feeding on different prey items and occupying a distinct ecological niche, the different types of theropods would have been out of direct competition.<ref name=\":21\" /><ref name=\"RMetal10\">{{cite journal |last=Amiot |first=R. |author2=Buffetaut, E. |author3=L\u00e9cuyer, C. |author4=Wang, X. |author5=Boudad, L. |author6=Ding, Z. |author7=Fourel, F. |author8=Hutt, S. |author9=Martineau, F. |author10=Medeiros, A. |author11=Mo, J. |author12=Simon, L. |author13=Suteethorn, V. |author14=Sweetman, S. |author15=Tong, H. |author16=Zhang, F. |author17=Zhou, Z. |year=2010 |title=Oxygen isotope evidence for semi-aquatic habits among spinosaurid theropods |journal=Geology |volume=38 |issue=2 |pages=139\u2013142 |doi=10.1130/G30402.1|bibcode=2010Geo....38..139A }}</ref>\n\n== Palaeoenvironment and palaeobiogeography ==\n[[File:Sao_Khua_Formation_V2.png|thumb|left|Restoration of ''Siamosaurus'' hunting fish in the Sao Khua Formation, with a herd of ''[[Phuwiangosaurus]]'' in the background]]\n\nThe sediments of the Sao Khua Formation, composed of [[Red clay|red clays]], [[Mudstone|mudstones]], [[Sandstone|sandstones]], [[Siltstone|siltstones]] and [[Conglomerate (geology)|conglomerate]] rocks, record a [[fluvial]] environment dominated by lakes, [[Floodplain|floodplains]], and meandering low-energy rivers.<ref name=\":12\" /><ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Eric|first=Buffetaut|last2=Varavudh|first2=Suteethorn|date=1998|title=The biogeographical significance of the Mesozoic vertebrates from Thailand|url=http://doc.rero.ch/record/15441|journal=Biogeography and Geological Evolution of SE Asia|language=en}}</ref> This is consistent with the types of vertebrate fauna present in the formation, which comprise only terrestrial or freshwater animals, including dinosaurs, turtles, freshwater [[hybodont sharks]] and [[Actinopterygii|actinopterygian]] fishes, and the freshwater crocodilian ''[[Sunosuchus]]''.<ref name=\":1\" /> Besides ''Siamosaurus'', there were dinosaurs like the [[Metriacanthosauridae|metriacanthosaurid]] ''Siamotyrannus isanensis'',<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Carrano|first1=M.

The books follow various time periods and revolve around the Assassins at war with the [[Knights Templar]].\n\n==''Renaissance''==\nThe first novel of this collection, ''Renaissance'', was published on November 20, 2009.<ref>{{cite web|title=Assassin's Creed Novel Coming Later This Month|url=http://www.kotaku.com.au/2009/11/assassins-creed-novel-coming-later-this-month/|publisher=[[Kotaku]]|last=Good|first=Owen|date=9 November 2009|accessdate=19 December 2012}}</ref>  The novel features [[Ezio Auditore da Firenze]], a man who seeks revenge for the murder of his family. Ezio begins to train himself as an assassin and becomes drawn into a war between the Assassin's Brotherhood and the Templar Order. The two secret organizations have been combating each other for centuries to secure an ancient technology, called the \"Apple of Eden\", a relic which can control human minds. Both groups also seek a vault in Italy, which contains the knowledge and technology of an ancient, technologically superior civilization.\n\n==''Brotherhood''==\n\n''Brotherhood''\u2014the second novel in the series, was released in 2010. It's a novelized version of the popular game ''[[Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood]]''. Just like its previous book, ''Assassin's Creed: Renaissance'', it does not contain any of the game's present-day events including Desmond, only a reference to a \"phantom\" by Ezio. The story takes place four years after the video game's story (1499), in 1503. Ezio Auditore struggles to free the city of [[Rome]] from the tyranny of [[Cesare Borgia]], who seeks to take over [[Italy]].\n\n==''The Secret Crusade''==\n''The Secret Crusade'''s story follows [[Alta\u00efr Ibn-La'Ahad|Alta\u00efr]], as told by [[Niccolo Polo]]. It details the life of Alta\u00efr, an Assassin; beginning with the death of his father. Alta\u00efr watches his father's execution; which was carried out for causing the unintended death of a noble. Some time later, he also watches one of his father's fellow Assassins kill himself out of guilt over the death of Alta\u00efr's father. The book then progresses to many years later where an older Alta\u00efr, with his wife Maria and their son Darim, are returning to Masyaf Alta\u00efr's home after successfully assassinating Genghis Khan. In their absence, Abbas proclaimed himself \"Master of the Assassins\" and took over Masyaf, ruling with tyranny. Alta\u00efr is met with cold indifference. He discovers that despite being told that his son Sef had traveled to Alamut, his son was actually murdered by Malik. Malik has been imprisoned but claims innocence. Alta\u00efr breaks him out of jail planning to confront Abbas and reclaim his place as Master Assassin. These plans are thwarted when Abbas has Malik killed and frames Alta\u00efr for his death. Out of anger, Alta\u00efr uses the Apple of Eden to kill the man responsible for Sef's death but also inadvertently causes Maria's death. Devastated, Alta\u00efr flees Masyaf.\n\nYears later a merchant named Muhklis is saved from desert bandits by Alta\u00efr, now an old man in his seventies. Muhklis takes an injured Alta\u00efr back to his home in Masyaf and agrees to help him reclaim his place. They hope to take back Masyaf with as little bloodshed as possible. They are joined by a few young men who are aligned against Abbas and are training in the traditional ways of the Assassins, which have been ignored during Abbas' reign. They, along with the people of Masyaf, storm the castle fighting through Abbas' men but only killing if absolutely necessary. Alta\u00efr faces Abbas for the last time, killing him with his pistol. With the death of their leader, Abbas' men lay down their arms and Alta\u00efr is proclaimed the leader of the Assassins. The final chapter shows that Ezio Auditore da Firenze (''Da Firenze'' means ''from Firenze/Florence'') is the narrator and he is on a boat arriving in Constantinople, in the second sequence of events in ''Revelations''. ''The Secret Crusade'' was released in June 2011.\n\n==''Revelations''==\n\n''Revelations'' once again follows Ezio Auditore as he leaves his life behind in search of the truth about the Assassin Order and \"those who came before\". The resulting journey leads him to [[Constantinople]] where a growing army of Byzantine Templars threatens the region. Ezio goes through many obstacles then decides to give up his life as an Assassin to save Desmond. This book was released on 24 November 2011 in the United Kingdom and on 29 November 2011 in the United States.\n\n==''Forsaken''==\n\nSet in 1735, ''Forsaken'' is Haytham Kenway's (Edward Kenway's son) personal journal and tracks his life, from his early childhood in England, through his rise up the Templar ranks. Unlike ''Revelations'', it is written in the first person and follows Haytham Kenway only. ''Forsaken'' was released on 4 December 2012.\n\n==''Black Flag''==\n\n''Black Flag'' follows the journal of Edward Kenway, the father of Haytham Kenway and grandfather of Connor Kenway. Edward Kenway is a young privateer who sets out to become the world's deadliest pirate, only to be drawn into the centuries-old war between the Assassins and the Templars.  ''Black Flag'' was released on 26 November 2013 and is based on the video game ''[[Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag]]''.\n\n==''Unity''==\n''Assassin's Creed Unity'' follows Elise and Arno's side of the video game ''[[Assassin's Creed Unity]]'' that takes place during the [[French Revolution]]. The book is based on this installment and was released in November 2014.\n\n== ''Underworld'' ==\n''Assassin's Creed Underworld'' follows Henry Green and Detective Abberline 6 years before the events of ''[[Assassin's Creed Syndicate|Syndicate]]'', eventually ending with the game's final missions in Evie's perspective.\n\n== ''Desert Oath'' ==\n''Assassin's Creed Origins: Desert Oath'' follows Bayek, a young boy who lives in Siwa in ancient Egypt. The events take place before the events of the game ''[[Assassin's Creed Origins]]''.

His best-known painting, ''Bharat Mata'' (Mother India), depicted a young woman, portrayed with four arms in the manner of Hindu deities, holding objects symbolic of India's national aspirations. The other prominent figures of the [[Bengal school of art]] were [[Gaganendranath Tagore]], Abanindranath's elder brother, [[Jamini Roy]], [[Mukul Dey]], [[Manishi Dey]] and [[Ram Kinker Baij]], who is more famous as the pioneer of Modern Indian Sculpture. Another important figure of this era was [[Chittaprosad Bhattacharya]], who rejected the classicism of the Bengal School and its spiritual preoccupations.<ref name=multi2>''Manifestations II'', Rabina Karode, Delhi Art Gallery 2004, {{ISBN|81-902104-0-8}}</ref> His book ''Hungry Bengal : a tour through Midnapur District'' included many sketches of the Bengal Famine drawn from life, as well as documentation of the persons depicted. The book was immediately banned by the British and 5000 copies were seized and destroyed. Only one copy was hidden by Chittaprosad's family and is now in the possession of the Delhi Art Gallery.\n\nDuring the opening years of the 20th century, Abanindranath developed links with Japanese cultural figures such as the art historian [[Okakura Kakuz\u014d]] and the painter [[Yokoyama Taikan]] as part of a globalised [[Modernism|Modernist]] initiative with [[pan-Asianism|pan-Asian]] tendencies.<ref>Arrowsmith, Rupert Richard.

The Bengal school's influence on Indian art scene gradually started alleviating with the spread of [[modernist]] ideas post-independence.\n\n==Santiniketan==\nThe mantle of the Bengal School was taken up when Rabindranath Tagore established the visionary university of [[Santiniketan]], a university focussed on the preservation and upliftment of Indian culture, values and heritage.<ref name=\"Turner2005\"/> It included an art school \"[[Kala Bhavan]]\" founded in 1920\u201321.

The Shantiniketan school of thought emphasised that \"an aesthetic was also an ethos, that art\u2019s role was more than life-enhancing, it was world-shaping\".<ref name=\"Cotter2008\"/> It established an Indian version of naturalism distinct from the oriental and western schools, one example being the eschewing of oil and easel painting for work on paper drawn/coloured using watercolours, wash, tempera and ink.<ref name=\"Turner2005\"/> Rabindranath Tagore's dream of veneration of old values, typified by motifs such as rural folk, especially [[Santhal people|Santhal]] tribals, came to fruition in the art-related schools of [[Viswa-Bharati University]] at Santiniketan.<ref name=\"Turner2005\"/> Some of the prominent artists of Santiniketan school are [[Benode Behari Mukherjee]], [[Ramkinkar Baij]], [[Manu Parekh]], [[Sankho Chaudhuri]],  [[Dinkar Kaushik]], [[K.

Ramachandran]], [[Sobha Brahma]], Ramananda Bandhapadhyay, Dharma Narayan Dasgupta, Sushen Ghose,  Janak Jhankar Narzary .\n\n===Contextual Modernism===\n{{main|Santiniketan: The Making of a Contextual Modernism}}\n[[File:Professor R. Siva Kumar.jpg|thumb|art historian [[R. Siva Kumar]]]]\nThe idea of [[Contextual Modernism]] emerged in 1997 from [[R. Siva Kumar]]'s [[Santiniketan: The Making of a Contextual Modernism]] as a [[postcolonial]] critical tool in the understanding of an alternative [[modernism]] in the visual arts of the erstwhile colonies like India, specifically that of the Santiniketan artists.\n\nSeveral terms including [[Paul Gilroy]]\u2019s ''counter culture of modernity'' and [[Tani Barlow]]'s ''Colonial modernity'' have been used to describe the kind of alternative modernity that emerged in non-European contexts. Professor Gall argues that \u2018Contextual Modernism\u2019 is a more suited term because \"the colonial in ''colonial modernity'' does not accommodate the refusal of many in colonized situations to internalize inferiority. Santiniketan\u2019s artist teachers\u2019 refusal of subordination incorporated a counter vision of modernity, which sought to correct the racial and cultural essentialism that drove and characterized imperial Western modernity and modernism. Those European modernities, projected through a triumphant British colonial power, provoked nationalist responses, equally problematic when they incorporated similar essentialisms.\"<ref>http://www.huichawaii.org/assets/gall,-david---overcoming-polarized-modernities.pdf</ref>\n\nAccording to [[R. Siva Kumar]] \"The Santiniketan artists were one of the first who consciously challenged this idea of modernism by opting out of both internationalist modernism and historicist indigenousness and tried to create a context sensitive modernism.\"<ref name=\"humanitiesunderground.org\">http://humanitiesunderground.org/all-the-shared-experiences-of-the-lived-world-ii/</ref> He had been studying the work of the Santiniketan masters and thinking about their approach to art since the early 80s. The practice of subsuming [[Nandalal Bose]], [[Rabindranath Tagore]], [[Ram Kinker Baij]] and [[Benode Behari Mukherjee]] under the [[Bengal School of Art]] was, according to Siva Kumar, misleading. ''This happened because early writers were guided by genealogies of apprenticeship rather than their styles, worldviews, and perspectives on art practice''.<ref name=\"humanitiesunderground.org\"/>\n\n''Contextual Modernism'' in the recent past has found its usage in other related fields of studies, specially in [[Architecture]].<ref>http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:444711</ref>\n\n==Post-independence==\nBy the time of Independence in 1947, several schools of art in India provided access to modern techniques and ideas. Galleries were established to showcase these artists. Modern Indian art typically shows the influence of Western styles, but is often inspired by Indian themes and images. Major artists are beginning to gain international recognition, initially among the Indian diaspora, but also among non-Indian audiences.\n\nThe [[Progressive Artists' Group]], established shortly after India became independent in 1947, was intended to establish new ways of expressing India in the post-colonial era. Its founder was [[Francis Newton Souza]] and [[S. H. Raza]], [[M. F. Husain]] and [[Manishi Dey]] were early members. It was profoundly influential in changing the idiom of Indian art. Almost all of the major artists of India in the 1950s were associated with the group. Prominent among them were [[Akbar Padamsee]], [[Sadanand Bakre]], [[Ram Kumar (artist)|Ram Kumar]], [[Tyeb Mehta]], [[K. H. Ara]], [[H. A. Gade]] and Bal Chabda.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ngmaindia.gov.in/sh-pag.asp |title=Showcase \u2013 Artists Collectives |publisher=National Gallery of Modern Art, New Delhi |date=2012-11-09 |accessdate=2013-12-13}}</ref> In 1950, [[Vasudeo S.

Women artists like [[B. Prabha]], [[Shanu Lahiri]], [[Arpita Singh]], [[Anjolie Ela Menon]] and [[Lalita Lajmi]] have made immense contributions to Modern Indian Art and Painting. Art historians like Prof. Rai [[Anand Krishna]] have also referred to those works of modern artistes that reflect Indian ethos. Some of the acclaimed contemporary Indian artists include [[Nagasamy Ramachandran]], [[Jitish Kallat]], [[Atul Dodiya]] and [[Geeta Vadhera]]  who has had acclaim in translating complex, Indian spiritual themes onto canvas like Sufi thought, the Upanishads and the Bhagwad Geeta.\n\nIndian Art got a boost with the economic liberalization of the country since early 1990s. Artists from various fields now started bringing in varied styles of work. Post liberalization Indian art works not only within the confines of academic traditions but also outside it. Artists have introduced new concepts which have hitherto not been seen in Indian art. [[Devajyoti Ray]] has introduced a new genre of art called [[Pseudorealism]]. Pseudorealist Art is an original art style that has been developed entirely on the Indian soil. Pseudorealism takes into account the Indian concept of abstraction and uses it to transform regular scenes of Indian life into fantastic images.\n\nIn post-liberalization India, many artists have established themselves in the international art market like the [[Abstract art|abstract painter]] [[Natvar Bhavsar]], abstract Art painter [[Nabakishore Chanda]], and sculptor [[Anish Kapoor]] whose mammoth [[postminimalist]] artworks have acquired attention for their sheer size.

His best-known painting, ''Bharat Mata'' (Mother India), depicted a young woman, portrayed with four arms in the manner of Hindu deities, holding objects symbolic of India's national aspirations. The other prominent figures of the [[Bengal school of art]] were [[Gaganendranath Tagore]], Abanindranath's elder brother, [[Jamini Roy]], [[Mukul Dey]], [[Manishi Dey]] and [[Ram Kinker Baij]], who is more famous as the pioneer of Modern Indian Sculpture. Another important figure of this era was [[Chittaprosad Bhattacharya]], who rejected the classicism of the Bengal School and its spiritual preoccupations.<ref name=multi2>''Manifestations II'', Rabina Karode, Delhi Art Gallery 2004, {{ISBN|81-902104-0-8}}</ref> His book ''Hungry Bengal : a tour through Midnapur District'' included many sketches of the Bengal Famine drawn from life, as well as documentation of the persons depicted.

The Shantiniketan school of thought emphasised that \"an aesthetic was also an ethos, that art\u2019s role was more than life-enhancing, it was world-shaping\".<ref name=\"Cotter2008\"/> It established an Indian version of naturalism distinct from the oriental and western schools, one example being the eschewing of oil and easel painting for work on paper drawn/coloured using watercolours, wash, tempera and ink.<ref name=\"Turner2005\"/> Rabindranath Tagore's dream of veneration of old values, typified by motifs such as rural folk, especially [[Santhal people|Santhal]] tribals, came to fruition in the art-related schools of [[Viswa-Bharati University]] at Santiniketan.<ref name=\"Turner2005\"/> Some of the prominent artists of Santiniketan school are [[Benode Behari Mukherjee]], [[Ramkinkar Baij]], [[Manu Parekh]], [[Sankho Chaudhuri]],  [[Dinkar Kaushik]], [[K.

Siva Kumar.jpg|thumb|art historian [[R. Siva Kumar]]]]\nThe idea of [[Contextual Modernism]] emerged in 1997 from [[R. Siva Kumar]]'s [[Santiniketan: The Making of a Contextual Modernism]] as a [[postcolonial]] critical tool in the understanding of an alternative [[modernism]] in the visual arts of the erstwhile colonies like India, specifically that of the Santiniketan artists.\n\nSeveral terms including [[Paul Gilroy]]\u2019s ''counter culture of modernity'' and [[Tani Barlow]]'s ''Colonial modernity'' have been used to describe the kind of alternative modernity that emerged in non-European contexts. Professor Gall argues that \u2018Contextual Modernism\u2019 is a more suited term because \"the colonial in ''colonial modernity'' does not accommodate the refusal of many in colonized situations to internalize inferiority. Santiniketan\u2019s artist teachers\u2019 refusal of subordination incorporated a counter vision of modernity, which sought to correct the racial and cultural essentialism that drove and characterized imperial Western modernity and modernism. Those European modernities, projected through a triumphant British colonial power, provoked nationalist responses, equally problematic when they incorporated similar essentialisms.\"<ref>http://www.huichawaii.org/assets/gall,-david---overcoming-polarized-modernities.pdf</ref>\n\nAccording to [[R. Siva Kumar]] \"The Santiniketan artists were one of the first who consciously challenged this idea of modernism by opting out of both internationalist modernism and historicist indigenousness and tried to create a context sensitive modernism.\"<ref name=\"humanitiesunderground.org\">http://humanitiesunderground.org/all-the-shared-experiences-of-the-lived-world-ii/</ref> He had been studying the work of the Santiniketan masters and thinking about their approach to art since the early 80s. The practice of subsuming [[Nandalal Bose]], [[Rabindranath Tagore]], [[Ram Kinker Baij]] and [[Benode Behari Mukherjee]] under the [[Bengal School of Art]] was, according to Siva Kumar, misleading. ''This happened because early writers were guided by genealogies of apprenticeship rather than their styles, worldviews, and perspectives on art practice''.<ref name=\"humanitiesunderground.org\"/>\n\n''Contextual Modernism'' in the recent past has found its usage in other related fields of studies, specially in [[Architecture]].<ref>http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:444711</ref>\n\n==Post-independence==\nBy the time of Independence in 1947, several schools of art in India provided access to modern techniques and ideas. Galleries were established to showcase these artists. Modern Indian art typically shows the influence of Western styles, but is often inspired by Indian themes and images. Major artists are beginning to gain international recognition, initially among the Indian diaspora, but also among non-Indian audiences.\n\nThe [[Progressive Artists' Group]], established shortly after India became independent in 1947, was intended to establish new ways of expressing India in the post-colonial era. Its founder was [[Francis Newton Souza]] and [[S. H. Raza]], [[M. F. Husain]] and [[Manishi Dey]] were early members. It was profoundly influential in changing the idiom of Indian art. Almost all of the major artists of India in the 1950s were associated with the group. Prominent among them were [[Akbar Padamsee]], [[Sadanand Bakre]], [[Ram Kumar (artist)|Ram Kumar]], [[Tyeb Mehta]], [[K. H. Ara]], [[H. A. Gade]] and Bal Chabda.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ngmaindia.gov.in/sh-pag.asp |title=Showcase \u2013 Artists Collectives |publisher=National Gallery of Modern Art, New Delhi |date=2012-11-09 |accessdate=2013-12-13}}</ref> In 1950, [[Vasudeo S.

Women artists like [[B. Prabha]], [[Shanu Lahiri]], [[Arpita Singh]], [[Anjolie Ela Menon]] and [[Lalita Lajmi]] have made immense contributions to Modern Indian Art and Painting. Art historians like Prof. Rai [[Anand Krishna]] have also referred to those works of modern artistes that reflect Indian ethos. Some of the acclaimed contemporary Indian artists include [[Nagasamy Ramachandran]], [[Jitish Kallat]], [[Atul Dodiya]] and [[Geeta Vadhera]]  who has had acclaim in translating complex, Indian spiritual themes onto canvas like Sufi thought, the Upanishads and the Bhagwad Geeta.\n\nIndian Art got a boost with the economic liberalization of the country since early 1990s. Artists from various fields now started bringing in varied styles of work. Post liberalization Indian art works not only within the confines of academic traditions but also outside it. Artists have introduced new concepts which have hitherto not been seen in Indian art. [[Devajyoti Ray]] has introduced a new genre of art called [[Pseudorealism]]. Pseudorealist Art is an original art style that has been developed entirely on the Indian soil. Pseudorealism takes into account the Indian concept of abstraction and uses it to transform regular scenes of Indian life into fantastic images.\n\nIn post-liberalization India, many artists have established themselves in the international art market like the [[Abstract art|abstract painter]] [[Natvar Bhavsar]], abstract Art painter [[Nabakishore Chanda]], and sculptor [[Anish Kapoor]] whose mammoth [[postminimalist]] artworks have acquired attention for their sheer size.
