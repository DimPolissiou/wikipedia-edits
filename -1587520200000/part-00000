It was established in 1901, and the building was placed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1997.\n\n==History==\n[[File:FrancisMDrake.jpg|thumb|left|165px|Francis M. Drake]]\nPrevious to the establishment of a public library, Centerville had a reading room founded by the Ladies of the Reading Room Library Association Group in 1896. Around the turn of the 20th century citizens started to investigate the possibility of establishing a library and approaching the [[Carnegie Corporation of New York]] to fund a new building.  They approached [[Francis M. Drake]], a former [[American Civil War|Civil War]] General, local attorney, banker, businessman, [[List of Governors of Iowa|Governor of Iowa]] and philanthropist to join their effort.  He refused saying he would prefer to fund the new library himself.  Drake sent an official proposal to the city council on April 9, 1901.  He would donate both the new building and the books with the requirement that the city was to maintain the building and take care of the annual expenses.<ref name=Drake2>{{cite web|author=|url=http://drakepubliclibrary.org/history/|title=History|publisher=Drake Public Library|accessdate=2016-02-29}}</ref><ref name=Naumann>{{cite web|author=Molly Myers Naumann|url=http://focus.nps.gov/pdfhost/docs/nrhp/text/97001290.PDF|title=Drake Public Library|publisher=[[National Park Service]]|accessdate=2016-02-29}}</ref>  The building was designed in the [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] style by [[Des Moines, Iowa|Des Moines]] architect C.E. Eastman. J.W. Sanderson of [[Burlington, Iowa]] was contracted to build the new library for $23,521.<ref name=Drake2/>  Its dedication was held on January 15, 1903.  A handicapped entrance and an elevator were added to the building in 1986.

Drake]]\nPrevious to the establishment of a public library, Centerville had a reading room founded by the Ladies of the Reading Room Library Association Group in 1896. Around the turn of the 20th century citizens started to investigate the possibility of establishing a library and approaching the [[Carnegie Corporation of New York]] to fund a new building.  They approached [[Francis M. Drake]], a former [[American Civil War|Civil War]] General, local attorney, banker, businessman, [[List of Governors of Iowa|Governor of Iowa]] and philanthropist to join their effort.  He refused saying he would prefer to fund the new library himself.  Drake sent an official proposal to the city council on April 9, 1901.  He would donate both the new building and the books with the requirement that the city was to maintain the building and take care of the annual expenses.<ref name=Drake2>{{cite web|author=|url=http://drakepubliclibrary.org/history/|title=History|publisher=Drake Public Library|accessdate=2016-02-29}}</ref><ref name=Naumann>{{cite web|author=Molly Myers Naumann|url=http://focus.nps.gov/pdfhost/docs/nrhp/text/97001290.PDF|title=Drake Public Library|publisher=[[National Park Service]]|accessdate=2016-02-29}}</ref>  The building was designed in the [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] style by [[Des Moines, Iowa|Des Moines]] architect C.E.
