His long-postponed ''[[Inglourious Basterds]]'', which tells an [[alternate history]] of [[Nazi Germany]], was released in 2009 to critical acclaim.

His long-postponed ''[[Inglourious Basterds]]'', which tells an [[alternate history]] of [[Nazi Germany]], was released in 2009 to critical acclaim.

They operate commercial and contracted routes, including route 99, a flexible service between [[Petworth]] and [[Chichester]]. This service has a fixed route, but will deviate off the route to serve a number of small villages if pre-booked.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.compass-travel.co.uk/download/west-sussex-bus-services/099.pdf|title=Route 99 timetable|last=|first=|date=|website=Compass Bus|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> In addition, a number of [[Sainsbury's]] special bus services are run, serving [[Rustington]] and Chichester Sainsbury's. Services to Benfield Park Sainsbury's were withdrawn in 2010.\n\nIn October 2006, the operation of some of Compass Travel's routes, mainly in the [[Burgess Hill]] area, passed to [[Countryliner Coaches|Countryliner]]. In September 2007, Compass picked up a number of routes formerly operated by Palaeobus when they ceased trading.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/sussex/6991688.stm Talks held as bus company closes] ''BBC News'' 12 September 2007</ref><ref>[http://www.theargus.co.uk/news/1684657.print/ Children left without transport after firm shuts] ''The Argus'' (Brighton) 13 September 2007</ref> The Holmbush Express services were added to the portfolio from 20 April 2009, along with several other enhancements to existing services.\n\nIn April 2009, Compass acquired the three coach Sussex Country Tours business, including a rare 25 seater Robin Hood bodied [[Mercedes-Benz buses|Mercedes-Benz]] coach.<ref>[http://data.companieshouse.gov.uk/doc/company/02988148 Companies House extract company no 2988148] Sussex Country Tours Limited</ref>\n\nWork with [[Brighton & Hove Albion F.C|Brighton & Hove Albion football club]] and rail replacement for [[Southern (train operating company)|Southern]] from the middle of 2011 saw the company expanding into new areas. [[Optare Solo]]s are regularly seen plying between [[Rottingdean]] and [[Falmer Stadium]], whereas the larger vehicles operate the services from [[Shoreham-by-Sea|Shoreham]] and Hangleton. Newer 10.8m Enviro 200s have strengthened the fleet to increase the number of vehicles available to rail replacement work, although at present this is largely restricted to services operating through Barnham under the low bridge.\n\nFrom 3 January 2012, Compass took over the operation of the [[Stagecoach South]] route 7 in Worthing under a franchise agreement. Unique in South East England, this arrangement gives the running of the service to Compass, whilst Stagecoach retain it as part of their network. The service was adjusted by splitting the two estates - North Sompting to be served by a modification of the original route 7, and the Test Road estate to the south by the new 7A. This enabled the service to be operated by three vehicles instead of four as previously. Stagecoach livery and route branding has been applied to the vehicles.<ref>[http://www.stagecoachbus.com/PdfUploads/Timetable_42246_07%20(Worthing).pdf Route 7 Timetable] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150611042009/https://www.stagecoachbus.com/PdfUploads/Timetable_42246_07%20%28Worthing%29.pdf |date=11 June 2015 }} Stagecoach 1 September 2013</ref>\n\nFurther expansion came when Compass won contracts to operate routes in East Sussex from 21 May 2012.

They operate commercial and contracted routes, including route 99, a flexible service between [[Petworth]] and [[Chichester]]. This service has a fixed route, but will deviate off the route to serve a number of small villages if pre-booked.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.compass-travel.co.uk/download/west-sussex-bus-services/099.pdf|title=Route 99 timetable|last=|first=|date=|website=Compass Bus|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> In addition, a number of [[Sainsbury's]] special bus services are run, serving [[Rustington]] and Chichester Sainsbury's. Services to Benfield Park Sainsbury's were withdrawn in 2010.\n\nIn October 2006 the operation of some of Compass Travel's routes, mainly in the [[Burgess Hill]] area, passed to [[Countryliner Coaches|Countryliner]]. In September 2007, Compass picked up a number of routes formerly operated by Palaeobus, when they ceased trading.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/sussex/6991688.stm Talks held as bus company closes] ''BBC News'' 12 September 2007</ref><ref>[http://www.theargus.co.uk/news/1684657.print/ Children left without transport after firm shuts] ''The Argus'' (Brighton) 13 September 2007</ref> The Holmbush Express services were added to the portfolio from 20 April 2009, along with several other enhancements to existing services.\n\nIn April 2009, Compass acquired the three coach Sussex Country Tours business, including a rare 25 seater Robin Hood bodied [[Mercedes-Benz buses|Mercedes-Benz]] coach.<ref>[http://data.companieshouse.gov.uk/doc/company/02988148 Companies House extract company no 2988148] Sussex Country Tours Limited</ref>\n\nWork with [[Brighton & Hove Albion F.C|Brighton & Hove Albion football club]] and rail replacement for [[Southern (train operating company)|Southern]] from the middle of 2011 saw the company expanding into new areas. [[Optare Solo]]s are regularly seen plying between [[Rottingdean]] and [[Falmer Stadium]], whereas the larger vehicles operate the services from [[Shoreham-by-Sea|Shoreham]] and Hangleton. Newer 10.8m Enviro 200s have strengthened the fleet to increase the number of vehicles available to rail replacement work, although at present this is largely restricted to services operating through Barnham under the low bridge.\n\nFrom 3 January 2012, Compass took over the operation of the [[Stagecoach South]] route 7 in Worthing under a franchise agreement. Unique in South East England, this arrangement gives the running of the service to Compass, whilst Stagecoach retain it as part of their network. The service was adjusted by splitting the two estates - North Sompting to be served by a modification of the original route 7, and the Test Road estate to the south by the new 7A. This enabled the service to be operated by three vehicles instead of four as previously. Stagecoach livery and route branding has been applied to the vehicles.<ref>[http://www.stagecoachbus.com/PdfUploads/Timetable_42246_07%20(Worthing).pdf Route 7 Timetable] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150611042009/https://www.stagecoachbus.com/PdfUploads/Timetable_42246_07%20%28Worthing%29.pdf |date=11 June 2015 }} Stagecoach 1 September 2013</ref>\n\nFurther expansion came when Compass won contracts to operate routes in East Sussex from 21 May 2012.

However, rice can be grown practically anywhere, even on a steep hill or mountain area with the use of water-controlling terrace systems. Although its parent species are native to Asia and certain parts of Africa, centuries of trade and exportation have made it commonplace in many cultures worldwide.\n\n[[File:Koeh-232.jpg|right|thumb|''[[Oryza sativa]]'', commonly known as Asian rice]]\nThe traditional method for cultivating rice is flooding the fields while, or after, setting the young seedlings. This simple method requires sound planning and servicing of the water damming and channeling, but reduces the growth of less robust weed and pest plants that have no submerged growth state, and deters [[vermin]]. While flooding is not mandatory for the cultivation of rice, all other methods of [[irrigation]] require higher effort in [[Weed control|weed]] and [[pest control]] during growth periods and a different approach for fertilizing the soil.\n\nThe name [[wild rice]] is usually used for species of the genera ''[[Zizania (genus)|Zizania]]'' and ''[[Porteresia]]'', both wild and domesticated, although the term may also be used for primitive or uncultivated varieties of ''[[Oryza]]''.\n\n==Etymology==\nFirst used in English in the middle of the 13th century, the word \"rice\" derives from the [[Old French]] {{lang|fro|ris}}, which comes from the [[Italian language|Italian]] {{lang|it|riso}}, in turn from the [[Latin]] {{lang|la|or\u0233za}}, which derives from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|\u1f44\u03c1\u03c5\u03b6\u03b1}} ({{lang|grc-Latn|oruza}}).

Short-grain rice is often used for [[rice pudding]].\n\n[[Instant rice]] differs from [[parboiled rice]] in that it is fully cooked and then dried, though there is a significant degradation in taste and texture. Rice flour and [[starch]] often are used in [[Batter (cooking)|batters]] and breadings to increase crispiness.\n\n===Preparation===\n[[File:Stages of rice milling.jpg|thumb|Unmilled to milled rice, from left to right, [[brown rice]], rice with [[Cereal germ|germ]], [[white rice]] ''([[Japanese rice]])'']]\n[[File:Rice Animation.gif|thumb|A: Rice with [[chaff]]<br>B: [[Brown rice]]<br>C: Rice with [[Cereal germ|germ]]<br>D: [[White rice]] with [[bran]] [[Crop residue|residue]]<br>E: Musenmai (Japanese: [[:ja:\u7121\u6d17\u7c73|\u7121\u6d17\u7c73]]), \"Polished and ready to boil rice\", literally, non-wash rice<br>(1): [[Chaff]]<br>(2): [[Bran]]<br>(3): Bran [[Crop residue|residue]]<br>(4): [[Cereal germ]]<br>(5): [[Endosperm]]]]\n\nRice is typically rinsed before cooking to remove excess [[starch]]. Rice produced in the US is usually fortified with vitamins and minerals, and rinsing will result in a loss of nutrients. Rice may be rinsed repeatedly until the rinse water is clear to improve the texture and taste.\n\nRice may be soaked to decrease cooking time, conserve fuel, minimize exposure to high temperature, and reduce stickiness. For some [[Variety (botany)|varieties]], soaking improves the texture of the cooked rice by increasing expansion of the grains. Rice may be soaked for 30 minutes up to several hours.\n\nBrown rice may be soaked in warm water for 20 hours to stimulate [[germination]]. This process, called [[germinated brown rice]] (GBR),<ref>{{cite web |title=Marketing of Value-Added Rice Products in Japan: Germinated Grown Rice and Rice Bread |url=http://www.hatsuga.com/DOMER/english/en/GBRRB.html |accessdate=February 12, 2004 |author1=Shoichi Ito |author2=Yukihiro Ishikawa |lastauthoramp=yes |publisher=Tottori University, Japan. |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6HeLK3CUV?url=http://www.hatsuga.com/DOMER/english/en/GBRRB.html |archive-date=June 25, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref> activates enzymes and enhances amino acids including [[gamma-aminobutyric acid]] to improve the nutritional value of brown rice. This method is a result of research carried out for the United Nations [[International Year of Rice]].\n\nRice is cooked by [[boiling]] or [[steaming]], and absorbs water during cooking. With the absorption method, rice may be cooked in a volume of water equal to the volume of dry rice plus any evaporation losses.<ref>The Best Way to Cook Rice is All About the Right Ratio- What's Eating Dan? [[America's Test Kitchen]]</ref> With the rapid-boil method, rice may be cooked in a large quantity of water which is drained before serving. Rapid-boil preparation is not desirable with enriched rice, as much of the enrichment additives are lost when the water is discarded. Electric [[rice cooker]]s, popular in Asia and Latin America, simplify the process of cooking rice. Rice (or any other grain) is sometimes quickly fried in oil or fat before boiling (for example [[saffron rice]] or [[risotto]]); this makes the cooked rice less sticky, and is a cooking style commonly called [[pilaf]] in [[Iran]] and [[Afghanistan]] or [[biryani]] in [[India]] and [[Pakistan]] .\n\n===Dishes===\n{{main|List of rice dishes}}\nIn [[Arab cuisine]], rice is an ingredient of many soups and dishes with fish, poultry, and other types of meat. It is used to stuff vegetables or is wrapped in grape leaves ([[dolma]]). When combined with milk, sugar, and honey, it is used to make desserts. In some regions, such as [[Tabaristan]], bread is made using rice flour. Rice may be made into [[congee]] (also called rice porridge or [[rice gruel]]) by adding more water than usual, so that the cooked rice is saturated with water, usually to the point that it disintegrates. Rice porridge is commonly eaten as a breakfast food, and is a traditional food for the sick.\n\n==Food==\n===Nutrition===\nRice is the [[staple food]] of over half the world's population. It is the predominant dietary energy source for 17 countries in Asia and the Pacific, 9 countries in North and South America and 8 countries in Africa. Rice provides 20% of the world's dietary energy supply, while wheat supplies 19% and maize (corn) 5%.<ref>{{cite web|title=Rice is Life|publisher=Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations|year=2004|url=http://www.fao.org/rice2004/en/f-sheet/factsheet3.pdf|access-date=November 21, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111110193515/http://www.fao.org/rice2004/en/f-sheet/factsheet3.pdf|archive-date=November 10, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nCooked, unenriched, white, long-grained rice is composed of 68% water, 28% [[carbohydrates]], 3% [[protein]], and negligible [[fat]] (table). In a 100 gram serving, it provides 130 [[calories]] and contains no [[micronutrient]]s in significant amounts, with all less than 10% of the [[Daily Value]] (DV) (table). Cooked, white, short-grained rice also provides 130 calories and contains moderate amounts of [[B vitamins]], [[iron]], and [[manganese]] (10\u201317% DV) per 100 gram amount (table).\n\nA detailed analysis of nutrient content of rice suggests that the nutrition value of rice varies based on a number of factors.

Historic written evidence for the earliest cultivation, however, comes from eighth century stone inscriptions from the central island of [[Java]], which show kings levied taxes in rice. The images of rice cultivation, rice barn, and mouse pest investing a rice field is evident in Karmawibhangga bas-reliefs of [[Borobudur]]. Divisions of labour between men, women, and animals that are still in place in Indonesian rice cultivation, were carved into relief friezes on the ninth century [[Prambanan|Prambanan temples]] in [[Central Java]]: a [[Domestic Asian Water buffalo|water buffalo]] attached to a plough; women planting seedlings and pounding grain; and a man carrying sheaves of rice on each end of a pole across his shoulders (''pikulan''). In the sixteenth century, Europeans visiting the Indonesian islands saw rice as a new prestige food served to the aristocracy during ceremonies and feasts.<ref name=\"TAYLOR_8\"/>\n\n====Nepal====\n[[File:Dili Reisfelder.jpg|thumb|Rice fields in [[Dili District|Dili]], [[East Timor]]]]\nRice is the major food amongst all the ethnic groups in [[Nepal]].

The harvest season generally calls for thanksgiving feasts, while the concluding harvest rites called ''tango'' or ''tungul'' (a [[day of rest]]) entails a strict taboo on any agricultural work. Partaking of the ''bayah'' (rice beer), rice cakes, and [[betel nut]] constitutes an indelible practise during the festivities.\n\nThe Ifugao people practice traditional farming spending most of their labor at their terraces and forest lands while occasionally tending to root crop cultivation. The Ifugaos have also<ref name=\"tourism.gov.ph\" /> been known to culture edible shells, fruit trees, and other vegetables which have been exhibited among Ifugaos for generations. The building of the rice terraces consists of blanketing walls with stones and earth which are designed to draw water from a main irrigation canal above the terrace clusters. Indigenous rice terracing technologies have been identified with the Ifugao's rice terraces such as their knowledge of water irrigation, stonework, earthwork and terrace maintenance. As their source of life and art, the rice terraces have sustained and shaped the lives of the community members.\n\n====Sri Lanka====\n[[File:BeFunky Chromatic 1.jpg|thumbnail|Indian women separating rice from straw]]\nRice is the staple food amongst all the ethnic groups in [[Sri Lanka]]. [[Agriculture in Sri Lanka]] mainly depends on the rice cultivation. Rice production is acutely dependent on rainfall and government supply necessity of water through irrigation channels throughout the cultivation seasons. The principal cultivation season, known as \"Maha\", is from October to March and the subsidiary cultivation season, known as \"Yala\", is from April to September. During Maha season, there is usually enough water to sustain the cultivation of all rice fields, nevertheless in Yala season there is only enough water for cultivation of half of the land extent. Traditional rice varieties are now making a comeback with the recent interest in green foods.\n\n====Thailand====\n{{main|Rice production in Thailand}}\n[[File:Cambodian farmers planting rice.jpg|thumb|Cambodian women planting rice.]]\nRice is the main export of Thailand, especially white jasmine rice 105 (Dok Mali 105).<ref>The genetic wonder of Thai rice, 1998</ref> Thailand has a large number of rice varieties, 3,500 kinds with different characters, and five kinds of wild rice cultivates.<ref>Science and technology with Thai rice, National center for genetic engineering, 2003</ref> In each region of the country there are different rice seed types.

The rice is planted when it is tall enough to poke out above the azolla. This method has been used for at least a thousand years.\n\n=== Middle East ===\nRice was grown in some areas of [[Mesopotamia]] (southern Iraq).

At the port of Charleston, through which 40% of all American slave imports passed, slaves from this region of Africa brought the highest prices due to their prior knowledge of rice culture, which was put to use on the many rice [[plantations in the American South|plantations]] around [[Georgetown, South Carolina|Georgetown]], [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]], and [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]].\n\nFrom the enslaved Africans, plantation owners learned how to dyke the [[marsh]]es and periodically flood the fields. At first the rice was laboriously milled by hand using large mortars and pestles made of wood, then winnowed in [[Muhlenbergia filipes|sweetgrass]] [[basket]]s (the making of which was another skill brought by slaves from Africa). The invention of the [[rice mill]] increased profitability of the crop, and the addition of water power for the mills in 1787 by [[millwright]] Jonathan Lucas was another step forward.\n\nRice culture in the southeastern U.S. became less profitable with the loss of slave labor after the [[American Civil War]], and it finally died out just after the turn of the 20th century. Today, people can visit the only remaining rice plantation in South Carolina that still has the original [[winnowing barn]] and rice mill from the mid-19th century at the historic [[Mansfield Plantation]] in [[Georgetown, South Carolina]].

It is mainly cultivated by small farmers in holdings of less than one [[hectare]]. Rice is also a wage commodity for workers in the cash crop or non-agricultural sectors. Rice is vital for the nutrition of much of the population in Asia, as well as in Latin America and the Caribbean and in Africa; it is central to the food security of over half the world population.\n\nMany rice grain producing countries have significant losses post-harvest at the farm and because of poor roads, inadequate storage technologies, inefficient supply chains and farmer's inability to bring the produce into retail markets dominated by small shopkeepers. A World Bank \u2013 FAO study claims 8% to 26% of rice is lost in developing nations, on average, every year, because of post-harvest problems and poor infrastructure.

At this point in the process, the product is called [[brown rice]]. The milling may be continued, removing the [[bran]], ''i.e.'', the rest of the husk and the [[cereal germ|germ]], thereby creating [[white rice]]. White rice, which keeps longer, lacks some important nutrients; moreover, in a limited diet which does not supplement the rice, brown rice helps to prevent the [[disease]] [[beriberi]].\n\nEither by hand or in a [[rice polisher]], white rice may be buffed with glucose or [[talc]] powder (often called polished rice, though this term may also refer to white rice in general), [[parboiled rice|parboiled]], or processed into flour. White rice may also be enriched by adding nutrients, especially those lost during the milling process. While the cheapest method of enriching involves adding a powdered blend of nutrients that will easily wash off (in the United States, rice which has been so treated requires a label warning against rinsing), more sophisticated methods apply nutrients directly to the grain, coating the grain with a water-insoluble substance which is resistant to washing.\n\nIn some countries, a popular form, [[parboiled rice]] (also known as '''converted rice''' and '''easy-cook rice'''<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.riceassociation.org.uk/content/1/10/varieties.html | title=Types of rice | publisher=Rice Association | access-date=August 2, 2018 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180802162740/http://www.riceassociation.org.uk/content/1/10/varieties.html | archive-date=August 2, 2018 | url-status=live }}</ref>) is subjected to a steaming or [[parboiling]] process while still a brown rice grain. The parboil process causes a gelatinisation of the starch in the grains. The grains become less brittle, and the color of the milled grain changes from white to yellow. The rice is then dried, and can then be milled as usual or used as brown rice. Milled parboiled rice is nutritionally superior to standard milled rice, because the process causes nutrients from the outer husk (especially [[thiamine]]) to move into the [[endosperm]], so that less is subsequently lost when the husk is polished off during milling. Parboiled rice has an additional benefit in that it does not stick to the pan during cooking, as happens when cooking regular white rice. This type of rice is eaten in parts of India and countries of West Africa are also accustomed to consuming parboiled rice.\n\n[[Rice bran]], called ''nuka'' in Japan, is a valuable commodity in Asia and is used for many daily needs. It is a moist, oily inner layer which is heated to produce oil. It is also used as a pickling bed in making [[Nukazuke|rice bran pickles]] and ''[[takuan]]''.\n\nRaw rice may be ground into flour for many uses, including making many kinds of beverages, such as ''[[amazake]], [[horchata]]'', [[rice milk]], and [[rice wine]]. Rice does not contain [[gluten]], so is suitable for people on a [[gluten-free diet]].<ref name=PenaginiDilillo2013>{{cite journal|vauthors=Penagini F, Dilillo D, Meneghin F, Mameli C, Fabiano V, Zuccotti GV|title=Gluten-free diet in children: an approach to a nutritionally adequate and balanced diet|journal=Nutrients|volume=5|issue=11|pages=4553\u201365|date=Nov 18, 2013|pmid=24253052|pmc=3847748|doi=10.3390/nu5114553|type=Review}}</ref> Rice may also be made into various types of [[noodle]]s. Raw, wild, or brown rice may also be consumed by [[Raw foodism|raw-foodist]] or [[fruitarians]] if soaked and [[Sprouting|sprouted]] (usually a week to 30 days \u2013 gaba rice).\n\nProcessed rice seeds must be boiled or steamed before eating. Boiled rice may be further fried in [[cooking oil]] or butter (known as [[fried rice]]), or beaten in a tub to make ''[[mochi]]''.\n\nRice is a good source of protein and a staple food in many parts of the world, but it is not a [[complete protein]]: it does not contain all of the [[essential amino acids]] in sufficient amounts for good health, and should be combined with other sources of protein, such as nuts, seeds, beans, fish, or meat.<ref name=\"Protein content\">{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0378-4290(02)00006-0 | title=Estimating the amino acid composition in milled rice by near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy | author=Jianguo G.

This process takes advantage of the grains' water content and typically involves heating grains in a special chamber. Further puffing is sometimes accomplished by processing puffed pellets in a low-[[pressure]] chamber. The [[ideal gas law]] means either lowering the local pressure or raising the water temperature results in an increase in [[volume]] prior to water [[evaporation]], resulting in a puffy [[Texture (food)|texture]]. Bulk raw rice density is about 0.9 g/cm\u00b3. It decreases to less than one-tenth that when puffed.\n\n===Harvesting, drying and milling===\n[[File:Rice-combine-harvester, Katori-city, Japan.jpg|thumb|Rice combine harvester [[Katori, Chiba|Katori-city]], [[Chiba Prefecture]], [[Japan]]]]\n[[File:Rice farmers Mae Wang Chiang Mai Province.jpg|thumb|After the harvest, rice straw is gathered in the traditional way from small paddy fields in [[Mae Wang District]], [[Chiang Mai Province]], [[Thailand]]]]\n{{Further|Paddy field}}\n<!-- [[Paddy]] and [[Padi]] link to this section -->\nUnmilled rice, known as \"paddy\" (Indonesia and Malaysia: padi; Philippines, palay), is usually harvested when the grains have a moisture content of around 25%. In most Asian countries, where rice is almost entirely the product of [[smallholder]] agriculture, harvesting is carried out manually, although there is a growing interest in mechanical harvesting. Harvesting can be carried out by the farmers themselves, but is also frequently done by seasonal labor groups. Harvesting is followed by [[threshing]], either immediately or within a day or two. Again, much threshing is still carried out by hand but there is an increasing use of mechanical threshers. Subsequently, paddy needs to be dried to bring down the moisture content to no more than 20% for milling.\n\nA familiar sight in several Asian countries is paddy laid out to dry along roads. However, in most countries the bulk of drying of marketed paddy takes place in mills, with village-level drying being used for paddy to be consumed by farm families. Mills either sun dry or use mechanical driers or both. Drying has to be carried out quickly to avoid the formation of molds. Mills range from simple [[Rice huller|hullers]], with a throughput of a couple of tonnes a day, that simply remove the outer husk, to enormous operations that can process 4,000 tonnes a day and produce highly polished rice. A good mill can achieve a paddy-to-rice conversion rate of up to 72% but smaller, inefficient mills often struggle to achieve 60%. These smaller mills often do not buy paddy and sell rice but only service farmers who want to mill their paddy for their own consumption.\n\n===Distribution===\nBecause of the importance of rice to human nutrition and food security in Asia, the domestic rice markets tend to be subject to considerable state involvement. While the private sector plays a leading role in most countries, agencies such as [[Indonesian Bureau of Logistics|BULOG]] in Indonesia, the [[National Food Authority (Philippines)|NFA]] in the Philippines, VINAFOOD in Vietnam and the [[Food Corporation of India]] are all heavily involved in purchasing of paddy from farmers or rice from mills and in distributing rice to poorer people. BULOG and NFA monopolise rice imports into their countries while VINAFOOD controls all exports from Vietnam.<ref>Shahidur Rashid, Ashok Gulari and Ralph Cummings Jnr (eds) (2008).

The genetically based ability of a rice variety to withstand pest attacks is called resistance. Three main types of plant resistance to pests are recognized as nonpreference, antibiosis, and tolerance.<ref name=j2/> Nonpreference (or antixenosis) describes host plants which insects prefer to avoid; antibiosis is where insect survival is reduced after the ingestion of host tissue; and tolerance is the capacity of a plant to produce high yield or retain high quality despite [[Home stored product entomology|insect infestation]].<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Kogan, M. |author2=Ortman, E.F. |title=Antixenosis a new term proposed to defined to describe Painter's \"non-preference\" modality of resistance |journal=Bull.

When a rice variety is no longer able to resist pest infestations, resistance is said to have broken down. Rice varieties that can be widely grown for many years in the presence of pests and retain their ability to withstand the pests are said to have durable resistance.

For example, Thai [[Jasmine rice]] is long-grain and relatively less sticky, as some long-grain rice contains less [[amylopectin]] than short-grain cultivars. Chinese restaurants often serve long-grain as plain unseasoned steamed rice though short-grain rice is common as well. Japanese [[mochigome|mochi rice]] and Chinese [[sticky rice]] are short-grain. Chinese people use sticky rice which is properly known as \"glutinous rice\" (note: glutinous refer to the glue-like characteristic of rice; does not refer to \"gluten\") to make [[zongzi]]. The [[Japanese rice|Japanese table rice]] is a sticky, short-grain rice. Japanese [[sake]] rice is another kind as well.\n\nIndian rice cultivars include long-grained and aromatic [[Basmati]] (\u0a2c\u0a3e\u0a38\u0a2e\u0a24\u0a40) (grown in the North), long and medium-grained [[Patna rice]], and in South India ([[Andhra Pradesh]] and [[Karnataka]]) short-grained [[Sona Masuri]] (also called as Bangaru theegalu). In the state of Tamil Nadu, the most prized cultivar is [[Ponni Rice|''ponni'']] which is primarily grown in the delta regions of the [[Kaveri]] River. [[Kaveri]] is also referred to as ponni in the South and the name reflects the geographic region where it is grown. In the Western Indian state of [[Maharashtra]], a short grain variety called [[Ambemohar]] is very popular. This rice has a characteristic fragrance of Mango blossom.\n\nAromatic rices have definite aromas and flavors; the most noted cultivars are Thai fragrant rice, Basmati, Patna rice, Vietnamese fragrant rice, and a [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] cultivar from America, sold under the trade name Texmati. Both Basmati and Texmati have a mild [[popcorn]]-like aroma and flavor. In Indonesia, there are also ''red'' and ''black'' cultivars.\n\nHigh-yield cultivars of rice suitable for cultivation in Africa and other dry [[ecosystems]], called the [[New Rice for Africa|new rice for Africa]] (NERICA) cultivars, have been developed. It is hoped that their cultivation will improve [[food security]] in West Africa.\n\nDraft [[genomes]] for the two most common rice cultivars, ''indica'' and ''japonica'', were published in April 2002. Rice was chosen as a [[model organism]] for the biology of grasses because of its relatively small genome (~430 mega[[base pairs]]). Rice was the first crop with a complete genome sequence.<ref>{{cite news | last=Gillis | first=Justing | title=Rice Genome Fully Mapped | date=August 11, 2005 | work=Washington Post | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/08/10/AR2005081001054.html | access-date=September 10, 2017 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170330212346/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/08/10/AR2005081001054.html | archive-date=March 30, 2017 | url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nOn December 16, 2002, the [[UN General Assembly]] declared the year 2004 the International Year of Rice.

Photosynthetic investment in the stem is reduced dramatically as the shorter plants are inherently more stable mechanically. Assimilates become redirected to grain production, amplifying in particular the effect of chemical fertilizers on commercial yield. In the presence of nitrogen fertilizers, and intensive crop management, these varieties increase their yield two to three times.\n\n=== Future potential ===\nAs the UN Millennium Development project seeks to spread global economic development to Africa, the \"Green Revolution\" is cited as the model for economic development. With the intent of replicating the successful Asian boom in agronomic productivity, groups like the [[Earth Institute]] are doing research on African agricultural systems, hoping to increase productivity. An important way this can happen is the production of \"[[New Rices for Africa]]\" (NERICA). These rices, selected to tolerate the low input and harsh growing conditions of African agriculture, are produced by the African Rice Center, and billed as technology \"from Africa, for Africa\". The NERICA have appeared in ''The New York Times'' (October 10, 2007) and ''International Herald Tribune'' (October 9, 2007), trumpeted as miracle crops that will dramatically increase rice yield in Africa and enable an economic resurgence.

Apart from this environmental benefit, the modification also increases the amount of rice grains by 43%, which makes it a useful tool in feeding a growing world population.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Su|first1=J.|last2=Hu|first2=C.|last3=Yan|first3=X.|last4=Jin|first4=Y.|last5=Chen|first5=Z.|last6=Guan|first6=Q.|last7=Wang|first7=Y.|last8=Zhong|first8=D.|last9=Jansson|first9=C.|last10=Wang|first10=F.|last11=Schn\u00fcrer|first11=A.|last12=Sun|first12=C.|title=Expression of barley SUSIBA2 transcription factor yields high-starch low-methane rice|journal=Nature|date=July 22, 2015|volume=523|issue=7562|pages=602\u201306|doi=10.1038/nature14673|bibcode=2015Natur.523..602S|pmid=26200336}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Gerry|title=Feeding the World One Genetically Modified Tomato at a Time: A Scientific Perspective|url=http://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2015/feeding-the-world/|website=SITN|accessdate=September 11, 2015|date=2015-08-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150910164510/http://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2015/feeding-the-world/|archive-date=September 10, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Meiosis and DNA repair==\nRice is used as a model organism for investigating the molecular mechanisms of meiosis and [[DNA repair]] in higher plants.

Medium-grain rice is used for sweet dishes, for ''[[risotto]]'' in Italy, and many rice dishes, such as ''[[arr\u00f2s negre]]'', in Spain. Some varieties of long-grain rice that are high in [[amylopectin]], known as Thai Sticky rice, are usually steamed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thaifoodandtravel.com/ingredients/stickyr.html|title=White Sticky Rice \u2013 Kao Niow|author=Loha-unchit, Kasma|accessdate=October 12, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121013231727/http://thaifoodandtravel.com/ingredients/stickyr.html|archive-date=October 13, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> A stickier medium-grain rice is used for ''[[sushi]]''; the stickiness allows rice to hold its shape when molded. Medium-grain rice is used extensively in Japan, including to accompany savoury dishes, where it is usually served plain in a separate dish. Short-grain rice is often used for [[rice pudding]].\n\n[[Instant rice]] differs from [[parboiled rice]] in that it is fully cooked and then dried, though there is a significant degradation in taste and texture. Rice flour and [[starch]] often are used in [[Batter (cooking)|batters]] and breadings to increase crispiness.\n\n===Preparation===\n[[File:Stages of rice milling.jpg|thumb|Unmilled to milled rice, from left to right, [[brown rice]], rice with [[Cereal germ|germ]], [[white rice]] ''([[Japanese rice]])'']]\n[[File:Rice Animation.gif|thumb|A: Rice with [[chaff]]<br>B: [[Brown rice]]<br>C: Rice with [[Cereal germ|germ]]<br>D: [[White rice]] with [[bran]] [[Crop residue|residue]]<br>E: Musenmai (Japanese: [[:ja:\u7121\u6d17\u7c73|\u7121\u6d17\u7c73]]), \"Polished and ready to boil rice\", literally, non-wash rice<br>(1): [[Chaff]]<br>(2): [[Bran]]<br>(3): Bran [[Crop residue|residue]]<br>(4): [[Cereal germ]]<br>(5): [[Endosperm]]]]\n\nRice is typically rinsed before cooking to remove excess [[starch]]. Rice produced in the US is usually fortified with vitamins and minerals, and rinsing will result in a loss of nutrients. Rice may be rinsed repeatedly until the rinse water is clear to improve the texture and taste.\n\nRice may be soaked to decrease cooking time, conserve fuel, minimize exposure to high temperature, and reduce stickiness. For some [[Variety (botany)|varieties]], soaking improves the texture of the cooked rice by increasing expansion of the grains. Rice may be soaked for 30 minutes up to several hours.\n\nBrown rice may be soaked in warm water for 20 hours to stimulate [[germination]]. This process, called [[germinated brown rice]] (GBR),<ref>{{cite web |title=Marketing of Value-Added Rice Products in Japan: Germinated Grown Rice and Rice Bread |url=http://www.hatsuga.com/DOMER/english/en/GBRRB.html |accessdate=February 12, 2004 |author1=Shoichi Ito |author2=Yukihiro Ishikawa |lastauthoramp=yes |publisher=Tottori University, Japan. |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6HeLK3CUV?url=http://www.hatsuga.com/DOMER/english/en/GBRRB.html |archive-date=June 25, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref> activates enzymes and enhances amino acids including [[gamma-aminobutyric acid]] to improve the nutritional value of brown rice. This method is a result of research carried out for the United Nations [[International Year of Rice]].\n\nRice is cooked by [[boiling]] or [[steaming]], and absorbs water during cooking. With the absorption method, rice may be cooked in a volume of water equal to the volume of dry rice plus any evaporation losses.<ref>The Best Way to Cook Rice is All About the Right Ratio- What's Eating Dan? [[America's Test Kitchen]]</ref> With the rapid-boil method, rice may be cooked in a large quantity of water which is drained before serving. Rapid-boil preparation is not desirable with enriched rice, as much of the enrichment additives are lost when the water is discarded. Electric [[rice cooker]]s, popular in Asia and Latin America, simplify the process of cooking rice. Rice (or any other grain) is sometimes quickly fried in oil or fat before boiling (for example [[saffron rice]] or [[risotto]]); this makes the cooked rice less sticky, and is a cooking style commonly called [[pilaf]] in [[Iran]] and [[Afghanistan]] or [[biryani]] in [[India]] and [[Pakistan]] .\n\n===Dishes===\n{{main|List of rice dishes}}\nIn [[Arab cuisine]], rice is an ingredient of many soups and dishes with fish, poultry, and other types of meat. It is used to stuff vegetables or is wrapped in grape leaves ([[dolma]]). When combined with milk, sugar, and honey, it is used to make desserts. In some regions, such as [[Tabaristan]], bread is made using rice flour. Rice may be made into [[congee]] (also called rice porridge or [[rice gruel]]) by adding more water than usual, so that the cooked rice is saturated with water, usually to the point that it disintegrates. Rice porridge is commonly eaten as a breakfast food, and is a traditional food for the sick.\n\n==Food==\n===Nutrition===\nRice is the [[staple food]] of over half the world's population. It is the predominant dietary energy source for 17 countries in Asia and the Pacific, 9 countries in North and South America and 8 countries in Africa. Rice provides 20% of the world's dietary energy supply, while wheat supplies 19% and maize (corn) 5%.<ref>{{cite web|title=Rice is Life|publisher=Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations|year=2004|url=http://www.fao.org/rice2004/en/f-sheet/factsheet3.pdf|access-date=November 21, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111110193515/http://www.fao.org/rice2004/en/f-sheet/factsheet3.pdf|archive-date=November 10, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nCooked, unenriched, white, long-grained rice is composed of 68% water, 28% [[carbohydrates]], 3% [[protein]], and negligible [[fat]] (table). In a 100 gram serving, it provides 130 [[calories]] and contains no [[micronutrient]]s in significant amounts, with all less than 10% of the [[Daily Value]] (DV) (table). Cooked, white, short-grained rice also provides 130 calories and contains moderate amounts of [[B vitamins]], [[iron]], and [[manganese]] (10\u201317% DV) per 100 gram amount (table).\n\nA detailed analysis of nutrient content of rice suggests that the nutrition value of rice varies based on a number of factors.

At first the rice was laboriously milled by hand using large mortars and pestles made of wood, then winnowed in [[Muhlenbergia filipes|sweetgrass]] [[basket]]s (the making of which was another skill brought by slaves from Africa). The invention of the [[rice mill]] increased profitability of the crop, and the addition of water power for the mills in 1787 by [[millwright]] Jonathan Lucas was another step forward.\n\nRice culture in the southeastern U.S. became less profitable with the loss of slave labor after the [[American Civil War]], and it finally died out just after the turn of the 20th century. Today, people can visit the only remaining rice plantation in South Carolina that still has the original [[winnowing barn]] and rice mill from the mid-19th century at the historic [[Mansfield Plantation]] in [[Georgetown, South Carolina]].

It is mainly cultivated by small farmers in holdings of less than one [[hectare]]. Rice is also a wage commodity for workers in the cash crop or non-agricultural sectors. Rice is vital for the nutrition of much of the population in Asia, as well as in Latin America and the Caribbean and in Africa; it is central to the food security of over half the world population.\n\nMany rice grain producing countries have significant losses post-harvest at the farm and because of poor roads, inadequate storage technologies, inefficient supply chains and farmer's inability to bring the produce into retail markets dominated by small shopkeepers. A World Bank \u2013 FAO study claims 8% to 26% of rice is lost in developing nations, on average, every year, because of post-harvest problems and poor infrastructure.

At this point in the process, the product is called [[brown rice]]. The milling may be continued, removing the [[bran]], ''i.e.'', the rest of the husk and the [[cereal germ|germ]], thereby creating [[white rice]]. White rice, which keeps longer, lacks some important nutrients; moreover, in a limited diet which does not supplement the rice, brown rice helps to prevent the [[disease]] [[beriberi]].\n\nEither by hand or in a [[rice polisher]], white rice may be buffed with glucose or [[talc]] powder (often called polished rice, though this term may also refer to white rice in general), [[parboiled rice|parboiled]], or processed into flour. White rice may also be enriched by adding nutrients, especially those lost during the milling process. While the cheapest method of enriching involves adding a powdered blend of nutrients that will easily wash off (in the United States, rice which has been so treated requires a label warning against rinsing), more sophisticated methods apply nutrients directly to the grain, coating the grain with a water-insoluble substance which is resistant to washing.\n\nIn some countries, a popular form, [[parboiled rice]] (also known as '''converted rice''' and '''easy-cook rice'''<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.riceassociation.org.uk/content/1/10/varieties.html | title=Types of rice | publisher=Rice Association | access-date=August 2, 2018 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180802162740/http://www.riceassociation.org.uk/content/1/10/varieties.html | archive-date=August 2, 2018 | url-status=live }}</ref>) is subjected to a steaming or [[parboiling]] process while still a brown rice grain. The parboil process causes a gelatinisation of the starch in the grains. The grains become less brittle, and the color of the milled grain changes from white to yellow. The rice is then dried, and can then be milled as usual or used as brown rice. Milled parboiled rice is nutritionally superior to standard milled rice, because the process causes nutrients from the outer husk (especially [[thiamine]]) to move into the [[endosperm]], so that less is subsequently lost when the husk is polished off during milling. Parboiled rice has an additional benefit in that it does not stick to the pan during cooking, as happens when cooking regular white rice. This type of rice is eaten in parts of India and countries of West Africa are also accustomed to consuming parboiled rice.\n\n[[Rice bran]], called ''nuka'' in Japan, is a valuable commodity in Asia and is used for many daily needs. It is a moist, oily inner layer which is heated to produce oil. It is also used as a pickling bed in making [[Nukazuke|rice bran pickles]] and ''[[takuan]]''.\n\nRaw rice may be ground into flour for many uses, including making many kinds of beverages, such as ''[[amazake]], [[horchata]]'', [[rice milk]], and [[rice wine]]. Rice does not contain [[gluten]], so is suitable for people on a [[gluten-free diet]].<ref name=PenaginiDilillo2013>{{cite journal|vauthors=Penagini F, Dilillo D, Meneghin F, Mameli C, Fabiano V, Zuccotti GV|title=Gluten-free diet in children: an approach to a nutritionally adequate and balanced diet|journal=Nutrients|volume=5|issue=11|pages=4553\u201365|date=Nov 18, 2013|pmid=24253052|pmc=3847748|doi=10.3390/nu5114553|type=Review}}</ref> Rice may also be made into various types of [[noodle]]s. Raw, wild, or brown rice may also be consumed by [[Raw foodism|raw-foodist]] or [[fruitarians]] if soaked and [[Sprouting|sprouted]] (usually a week to 30 days \u2013 gaba rice).\n\nProcessed rice seeds must be boiled or steamed before eating. Boiled rice may be further fried in [[cooking oil]] or butter (known as [[fried rice]]), or beaten in a tub to make ''[[mochi]]''.\n\nRice is a good source of protein and a staple food in many parts of the world, but it is not a [[complete protein]]: it does not contain all of the [[essential amino acids]] in sufficient amounts for good health, and should be combined with other sources of protein, such as nuts, seeds, beans, fish, or meat.<ref name=\"Protein content\">{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0378-4290(02)00006-0 | title=Estimating the amino acid composition in milled rice by near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy | author=Jianguo G.

This process takes advantage of the grains' water content and typically involves heating grains in a special chamber. Further puffing is sometimes accomplished by processing puffed pellets in a low-[[pressure]] chamber. The [[ideal gas law]] means either lowering the local pressure or raising the water temperature results in an increase in [[volume]] prior to water [[evaporation]], resulting in a puffy [[Texture (food)|texture]]. Bulk raw rice density is about 0.9 g/cm\u00b3. It decreases to less than one-tenth that when puffed.\n\n===Harvesting, drying and milling===\n[[File:Rice-combine-harvester, Katori-city, Japan.jpg|thumb|Rice combine harvester [[Katori, Chiba|Katori-city]], [[Chiba Prefecture]], [[Japan]]]]\n[[File:Rice farmers Mae Wang Chiang Mai Province.jpg|thumb|After the harvest, rice straw is gathered in the traditional way from small paddy fields in [[Mae Wang District]], [[Chiang Mai Province]], [[Thailand]]]]\n{{Further|Paddy field}}\n<!-- [[Paddy]] and [[Padi]] link to this section -->\nUnmilled rice, known as \"paddy\" (Indonesia and Malaysia: padi; Philippines, palay), is usually harvested when the grains have a moisture content of around 25%. In most Asian countries, where rice is almost entirely the product of [[smallholder]] agriculture, harvesting is carried out manually, although there is a growing interest in mechanical harvesting. Harvesting can be carried out by the farmers themselves, but is also frequently done by seasonal labor groups. Harvesting is followed by [[threshing]], either immediately or within a day or two. Again, much threshing is still carried out by hand but there is an increasing use of mechanical threshers. Subsequently, paddy needs to be dried to bring down the moisture content to no more than 20% for milling.\n\nA familiar sight in several Asian countries is paddy laid out to dry along roads. However, in most countries the bulk of drying of marketed paddy takes place in mills, with village-level drying being used for paddy to be consumed by farm families. Mills either sun dry or use mechanical driers or both. Drying has to be carried out quickly to avoid the formation of molds. Mills range from simple [[Rice huller|hullers]], with a throughput of a couple of tonnes a day, that simply remove the outer husk, to enormous operations that can process 4,000 tonnes a day and produce highly polished rice. A good mill can achieve a paddy-to-rice conversion rate of up to 72% but smaller, inefficient mills often struggle to achieve 60%. These smaller mills often do not buy paddy and sell rice but only service farmers who want to mill their paddy for their own consumption.\n\n===Distribution===\nBecause of the importance of rice to human nutrition and food security in Asia, the domestic rice markets tend to be subject to considerable state involvement. While the private sector plays a leading role in most countries, agencies such as [[Indonesian Bureau of Logistics|BULOG]] in Indonesia, the [[National Food Authority (Philippines)|NFA]] in the Philippines, VINAFOOD in Vietnam and the [[Food Corporation of India]] are all heavily involved in purchasing of paddy from farmers or rice from mills and in distributing rice to poorer people. BULOG and NFA monopolise rice imports into their countries while VINAFOOD controls all exports from Vietnam.<ref>Shahidur Rashid, Ashok Gulari and Ralph Cummings Jnr (eds) (2008).

Although there was no shortage of rice on world markets this general upward trend in grain prices led to panic buying by consumers, government rice export bans (in particular, by Vietnam and India) and inflated import orders by the Philippines marketing board, the National Food Authority. This caused significant rises in rice prices.

For example, Thai [[Jasmine rice]] is long-grain and relatively less sticky, as some long-grain rice contains less [[amylopectin]] than short-grain cultivars. Chinese restaurants often serve long-grain as plain unseasoned steamed rice though short-grain rice is common as well. Japanese [[mochigome|mochi rice]] and Chinese [[sticky rice]] are short-grain. Chinese people use sticky rice which is properly known as \"glutinous rice\" (note: glutinous refer to the glue-like characteristic of rice; does not refer to \"gluten\") to make [[zongzi]]. The [[Japanese rice|Japanese table rice]] is a sticky, short-grain rice. Japanese [[sake]] rice is another kind as well.\n\nIndian rice cultivars include long-grained and aromatic [[Basmati]] (\u0a2c\u0a3e\u0a38\u0a2e\u0a24\u0a40) (grown in the North), long and medium-grained [[Patna rice]], and in South India ([[Andhra Pradesh]] and [[Karnataka]]) short-grained [[Sona Masuri]] (also called as Bangaru theegalu). In the state of Tamil Nadu, the most prized cultivar is [[Ponni Rice|''ponni'']] which is primarily grown in the delta regions of the [[Kaveri]] River. [[Kaveri]] is also referred to as ponni in the South and the name reflects the geographic region where it is grown. In the Western Indian state of [[Maharashtra]], a short grain variety called [[Ambemohar]] is very popular. This rice has a characteristic fragrance of Mango blossom.\n\nAromatic rices have definite aromas and flavors; the most noted cultivars are Thai fragrant rice, Basmati, Patna rice, Vietnamese fragrant rice, and a [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] cultivar from America, sold under the trade name Texmati. Both Basmati and Texmati have a mild [[popcorn]]-like aroma and flavor. In Indonesia, there are also ''red'' and ''black'' cultivars.\n\nHigh-yield cultivars of rice suitable for cultivation in Africa and other dry [[ecosystems]], called the [[New Rice for Africa|new rice for Africa]] (NERICA) cultivars, have been developed. It is hoped that their cultivation will improve [[food security]] in West Africa.\n\nDraft [[genomes]] for the two most common rice cultivars, ''indica'' and ''japonica'', were published in April 2002. Rice was chosen as a [[model organism]] for the biology of grasses because of its relatively small genome (~430 mega[[base pairs]]).

Photosynthetic investment in the stem is reduced dramatically as the shorter plants are inherently more stable mechanically. Assimilates become redirected to grain production, amplifying in particular the effect of chemical fertilizers on commercial yield. In the presence of nitrogen fertilizers, and intensive crop management, these varieties increase their yield two to three times.\n\n=== Future potential ===\nAs the UN Millennium Development project seeks to spread global economic development to Africa, the \"Green Revolution\" is cited as the model for economic development. With the intent of replicating the successful Asian boom in agronomic productivity, groups like the [[Earth Institute]] are doing research on African agricultural systems, hoping to increase productivity. An important way this can happen is the production of \"[[New Rices for Africa]]\" (NERICA). These rices, selected to tolerate the low input and harsh growing conditions of African agriculture, are produced by the African Rice Center, and billed as technology \"from Africa, for Africa\". The NERICA have appeared in ''The New York Times'' (October 10, 2007) and ''International Herald Tribune'' (October 9, 2007), trumpeted as miracle crops that will dramatically increase rice yield in Africa and enable an economic resurgence.

Apart from this environmental benefit, the modification also increases the amount of rice grains by 43%, which makes it a useful tool in feeding a growing world population.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Su|first1=J.|last2=Hu|first2=C.|last3=Yan|first3=X.|last4=Jin|first4=Y.|last5=Chen|first5=Z.|last6=Guan|first6=Q.|last7=Wang|first7=Y.|last8=Zhong|first8=D.|last9=Jansson|first9=C.|last10=Wang|first10=F.|last11=Schn\u00fcrer|first11=A.|last12=Sun|first12=C.|title=Expression of barley SUSIBA2 transcription factor yields high-starch low-methane rice|journal=Nature|date=July 22, 2015|volume=523|issue=7562|pages=602\u201306|doi=10.1038/nature14673|bibcode=2015Natur.523..602S|pmid=26200336}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Gerry|title=Feeding the World One Genetically Modified Tomato at a Time: A Scientific Perspective|url=http://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2015/feeding-the-world/|website=SITN|accessdate=September 11, 2015|date=2015-08-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150910164510/http://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2015/feeding-the-world/|archive-date=September 10, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Meiosis and DNA repair==\nRice is used as a model organism for investigating the molecular mechanisms of meiosis and [[DNA repair]] in higher plants.
