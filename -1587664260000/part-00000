At last a Byzantine army arrived from the Balkans to drive the Rus' back, and a naval contingent reportedly destroyed much of the Rus' fleet on its return voyage (possibly an exaggeration since the Rus' soon mounted another attack).

In contrast with his mother's conversion to [[History of Christianity#High Middle Ages (800\u20131299)|Christianity]], Sviatoslav, like his [[druzhina]], remained a staunch [[paganism|pagan]]. Due to his abrupt death in an ambush in 972, Sviatoslav's conquests, for the most part, were not consolidated into a functioning empire, while his failure to establish a stable succession led to a [[fratricide|fratricidal]] feud among his sons, which resulted in two of his three sons being killed.\n\n===Reign of Vladimir and Christianisation===\n{{Main|Christianization of Kievan Rus'}}\n[[File:Izias\u0142a\u016d, Rahnieda, Volodymyr. \u0406\u0437\u044f\u0441\u043b\u0430\u045e, \u0420\u0430\u0433\u043d\u0435\u0434\u0430, \u0412\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043c\u0438\u0440.jpg|thumb|[[Rogneda of Polotsk]], [[Vladimir I of Kiev]] and [[Izyaslav of Polotsk]]]]\n[[File:Vasnetsov Bapt Vladimir fresco in Kiev.jpg|thumb|''Baptism of Saint Prince Vladimir'', by [[Viktor Vasnetsov]], in the [[St Volodymyr's Cathedral]]]]\n\nIt is not clearly documented when the title of the Grand Duke was first introduced, but the importance of the Kiev principality was recognized after the death of Sviatoslav I in 972 and the ensuing struggle between [[Vladimir I of Kiev|Vladimir the Great]] and [[Yaropolk I of Kiev|Yaropolk I]]. The region of Kiev dominated the state of Kievan Rus' for the next two centuries. The [[Grand Prince]] (''\"velikiy kniaz'\"'') of Kiev controlled the lands around the city, and his formally subordinate relatives ruled the other cities and paid him tribute. The zenith of the state's power came during the reigns of Vladimir the Great (980\u20131015) and Prince [[Yaroslav I the Wise]] (1019\u20131054). Both rulers continued the steady expansion of Kievan Rus' that had begun under Oleg.\n\nVladimir had been prince of Novgorod when his father Sviatoslav I died in 972. He was forced to flee to [[Scandinavia]] in 976 after his half-brother Yaropolk had murdered his other brother [[Oleg of Drelinia|Oleg]] and taken control of Rus.

The [[Primary Chronicle]] states that when Vladimir had decided to accept a new faith instead of the traditional [[Slavic mythology|idol-worship]] ([[paganism]]) of the Slavs, he sent out some of his most valued advisors and warriors as emissaries to different parts of Europe. They visited the Christians of the [[Latin Rite]], the [[Jew]]s, and the [[Muslims]] before finally arriving in Constantinople. They rejected Islam because, among other things, it prohibited the consumption of alcohol, and Judaism because the god of the Jews had permitted his [[chosen people]] to be deprived of their country. They found the ceremonies in the Roman church to be dull. But at Constantinople, they were so astounded by the beauty of the cathedral of [[Hagia Sophia]] and the liturgical service held there that they made up their minds there and then about the faith they would like to follow. Upon their arrival home, they convinced Vladimir that the faith of the [[Byzantine Rite]] was the best choice of all, upon which Vladimir made a journey to Constantinople and arranged to marry [[Anna Porphyrogenita|Princess Anna]], the sister of Byzantine emperor [[Basil II]].<ref>Janet Martin, Medieval Russia, 980\u20131584, (Cambridge, 1995), p. 6-7</ref>\n\n[[File:Eggink VelKnVladimir.jpg|thumb|left|Ivan Eggink's painting represents [[Vladimir the Great|Vladimir]] listening to the Orthodox priests, while the papal envoy stands aside in discontent.]]\n\nVladimir's choice of Eastern Christianity may also have reflected his close personal ties with Constantinople, which dominated the Black Sea and hence trade on Kiev's most vital commercial route, the [[Dnieper River]]. Adherence to the [[Eastern Church]] had long-range political, cultural, and religious consequences. The church had a [[liturgy]] written in [[Cyrillic]] and a corpus of translations from Greek that had been produced for the [[Slavic peoples]]. This literature facilitated the conversion to Christianity of the [[Eastern Slavs]] and introduced them to rudimentary [[Greek philosophy]], science, and [[historiography]] without the necessity of learning [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] (there were some merchants who did business with Greeks and likely had an understanding of contemporary business Greek).<ref>{{cite journal|last=Franklin|first=Simon|title=Greek in Kievan Rus'|journal=Dumbarton Oaks Papers|year=1992|volume=46|pages=69\u201381|doi=10.2307/1291640|jstor=1291640}}</ref> In contrast, educated people in medieval [[Western Europe|Western]] and [[Central Europe]] learned [[Latin (language)|Latin]].

Following the [[East\u2013West Schism|Great Schism]] of 1054, the Rus' church maintained communion with both Rome and Constantinople for some time, but along with most of the Eastern churches it eventually split to follow the Eastern Orthodox.

Yaroslav also arranged marriages for his sister and three daughters to the kings of Poland, France, Hungary and Norway. Yaroslav promulgated the first East Slavic law code, ''[[Russkaya Pravda]]''; built [[Saint Sophia Cathedral in Kiev]] and [[Saint Sophia Cathedral in Novgorod]]; patronized local clergy and [[monasticism]]; and is said to have founded a school system. Yaroslav's sons developed the great [[Kiev Pechersk Lavra]] ([[monastery]]), which functioned in Kievan Rus' as an ecclesiastical academy.\n\nIn the centuries that followed the state's foundation, [[Rurik Dynasty|Rurik's descendants]] shared power over Kievan Rus'. Princely succession moved from elder to younger brother and from uncle to nephew, as well as from father to son. Junior members of the dynasty usually began their official careers as rulers of a minor district, progressed to more lucrative principalities, and then competed for the coveted throne of Kiev.\n\n===Fragmentation and decline===\nThe gradual disintegration of the Kievan Rus' began in the 11th century, after the death of [[Yaroslav the Wise]]. The position of the [[Grand Prince of Kiev]] was weakened by the growing influence of regional clans.\n\nAn unconventional power succession system was established ([[rota system]]) whereby power was transferred to the eldest member of the ruling dynasty rather than from father to son, i.e. in most cases to the eldest brother of the ruler, fomenting constant hatred and rivalry within the royal family.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}} [[Familicide]] was frequently deployed to obtain power and can be traced particularly during the time of the Yaroslavichi (sons of Yaroslav), when the established system was skipped in the establishment of [[Vladimir II Monomakh]] as the Grand Prince of Kiev,{{Clarify|date=September 2013}}<!--Why was the established rota system 'skipped'?--> in turn creating major squabbles between [[Oleg I of Chernigov|Olegovichi]] from [[Chernihiv]], Monomakhs from [[Pereyaslav]], [[Izyaslav I of Kiev|Izyaslavichi]] from [[Principality of Turov|Turov]]/[[Volhynia]], and [[Polotsk Principality|Polotsk Princes]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}<!--This and following paragraph need to be amalgamated as they're both dealing with same subject matter.-->\n\n[[File:Kievan Nativity.jpg|thumb|''The Nativity'', a Kievan (possibly Galician) illumination from the [[Gertrude Psalter]]]]\n\nThe most prominent struggle for power was the conflict that erupted after the death of Yaroslav the Wise. The rivaling [[Principality of Polotsk]] was contesting the power of the Grand Prince by occupying Novgorod, while [[Rostislav of Tmutarakan|Rostislav Vladimirovich]] was fighting for the Black Sea port of [[Tmutarakan]] belonging to Chernihiv.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}} Three of Yaroslav's sons that first allied together found themselves fighting each other especially after their defeat to the Cuman forces in 1068 at the [[Battle of the Alta River]].

On the initiative of Vladimir II Monomakh in 1097 the first [[Council of Liubech|federal council]] of Kievan Rus took place near Chernihiv in the city of [[Liubech]] with the main intention to find an understanding among the fighting sides. However, even though that did not really stop the fighting, it certainly cooled things off.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}\n\nBy 1130, all descendants of [[Vseslav of Polotsk|Vseslav the Seer]] had been exiled to the [[Byzantine Empire]] by [[Mstislav the Great]]. The most fierce resistance to Monomakhs posed Olegovichi when the [[izgoi]] [[Vsevolod II of Kiev|Vsevolod II]] managed to become the Grand Prince of Kiev.

The [[trade route from the Varangians to the Greeks]], along which the goods were moving from the Black Sea (mainly [[Byzantine]]) through [[eastern Europe]] to the Baltic, was a cornerstone of Kiev wealth and prosperity. These trading routes became less important as the Byzantine Empire declined in power and Western Europe created new trading trading routes to Asia and the Near East. As people relied less on passing through Kievan Rus' territories for trade, the Kievan Rus' economy suffered.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Russia : a historical introduction from Kievan Rus' to the present|last=Thompson, John M.

After his death in 1132, the Kievan Rus' fell into recession and a rapid decline, and Mstislav's successor [[Yaropolk II of Kiev]] instead of focusing on the external threat of the [[Cumans]] was embroiled in conflicts with the growing power of the [[Novgorod Republic]]. In 1169, as the Kievan Rus' state was full of internal conflict, Andrei Bogolyubsky of Vladimir sacked the city of Kiev. The sack of the city fundamentally changed the perception of Kiev and was evidence of the fragmentation of the Kievan Rus'.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Pelenski|first=Jaroslaw|title=The Sack of Kiev of 1169: Its Significance for the Succession to Kievan Rus'|journal=Harvard Ukrainian Studies|year=1987|volume=11|pages=303\u2013316}}</ref> By the end of the 12th century, the Kievan state became even further fragmented and had been divided into roughly twelve different principalities.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Kollmann|first=Nancy|title=Collateral Succession in Kievan Rus|journal=Harvard Ukrainian Studies|year=1990|volume=14|pages=377\u2013387}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Crusades]] brought a shift in European trade routes that accelerated the decline of Kievan Rus'. In 1204, the forces of the [[Fourth Crusade]] sacked Constantinople, making the [[Dnieper River|Dnieper]] trade route marginal.<ref name=\"occawlonline.pearsoned.com\"/> At the same time, the [[Livonian Brothers of the Sword]] (of the [[Northern Crusades]]) were conquering the [[Baltic region|Baltic]] region and threatening the [[Lands of Novgorod]]. Concurrently with it, the Ruthenian Federation of Kievan Rus' started to disintegrate into smaller principalities as the Rurik dynasty grew. The local [[Orthodox Christianity]] of Kievan Rus', while struggling to establish itself in the predominantly pagan state and losing its main base in Constantinople, was on the brink of extinction. Some of the main regional centres that developed later were Novgorod, Chernigov, Halych, Kiev, Ryazan, Vladimir-upon-Klyazma, Volodimer-Volyn and Polotsk.\n\n====Novgorod Republic====\n{{Main|Republic of Novgorod}}\n\nIn the north, the [[Republic of Novgorod]] prospered because it controlled trade routes from the [[River Volga]] to the Baltic Sea. As Kievan Rus' declined, Novgorod became more independent. A local [[oligarchy]] ruled Novgorod; major government decisions were made by a town assembly, which also elected a prince as the city's military leader. In 1136, Novgorod revolted against Kiev, and became independent.{{sfn|Magocsi|2010|page=85}} Now an independent [[city state|city republic]], and referred to as \"Lord Novgorod the Great\" it would spread its \"mercantile interest\" to the west and the north; to the Baltic Sea and the low-populated forest regions respectively.{{sfn|Magocsi|2010|page=85}} In 1169, Novgorod acquired its own [[Archbishop of Novgorod|archbishop]], named [[Ilya (Archbishop of Novgorod)|Ilya]], a sign of further increased importance and political independence. Novgorod enjoyed a wide degree of autonomy although being closely associated with the Kievan Rus.\n\n====Northeast====\n{{Main|Vladimir-Suzdal}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2017}}\n[[File:Europe-1139.jpg|thumb|1139 map of the Grand Duchy of Kiev, where northeastern territories identified as the Transforrest Colonies (Zalesie) by [[Joachim Lelewel]]]]\n\nIn the northeast, Slavs from the Kievan region colonized the territory that later would become the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]] by subjugating and merging with the Finnic tribes already occupying the area. The city of [[Rostov]], the oldest centre of the northeast, was supplanted first by [[Suzdal]] and then by the city of [[Vladimir, Russia|Vladimir]], which become the capital of [[Vladimir-Suzdal']]. The combined [[principality]] of Vladimir-Suzdal asserted itself as a major power in Kievan Rus' in the late 12th century. In 1169, [[Prince Andrey Bogolyubskiy]] of Vladimir-Suzdal sacked the city of Kiev and took over the title of the (\u0412\u0435\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u041a\u043d\u044f\u0437\u044c/Velikiy Knyaz/Grand Prince or Grand Duke) to claim primacy in Rus'. Prince Andrey then installed his younger brother, who ruled briefly in Kiev while Andrey continued to rule his realm from Suzdal. In 1299, in the wake of the [[Mongol invasion of Rus|Mongol invasion]], the [[metropolitan bishop|metropolitan]] moved from Kiev to the city of Vladimir and Vladimir-Suzdal.\n\n====Southwest====\n{{Main|Kingdom of Galicia\u2013Volhynia}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2017}}\n\nTo the southwest, the principality of [[Halych]] had developed trade relations with its [[Poland|Polish]], [[Hungary|Hungarian]] and [[Lithuania]]n neighbours and emerged as the local successor to Kievan Rus'. In 1199, [[Roman the Great|Prince Roman Mstislavych]] united the two previously separate principalities of Halych and [[Volhynia|Volyn]]. In 1202 he conquered Kiev, and assumed the title of [[Knyaz]] of Kievan Rus', which was held by the rulers of Vladimir-Suzdal since 1169. His son, [[Prince Daniel]] (r. 1238\u20131264) looked for support from the West. He accepted a crown as a \"Rex Rusiae\" (\"King of Rus\") from the Roman [[papacy]], apparently doing so without breaking with Constantinople. In 1370, the patriarch of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] in Constantinople granted the King of [[Poland]] a metropolitan for his Ruthenian subjects. Lithuanian rulers also requested and received a metropolitan for Novagrudok shortly afterwards. [[Cyprian, Metropolitan of Moscow|Cyprian]], a candidate pushed by the Lithuanian rulers, became Metropolitan of Kiev in 1375 and metropolitan of Moscow in 1382; this way the church in the territory of former Kievan Rus was reunited for some time. In 1439, Kiev became the seat of a separate \"Metropolitan of Kiev, Halych and all Rus'\" for all Greek Orthodox Christians under Polish-Lithuanian rule.\n\nHowever, a long and unsuccessful struggle against the Mongols combined with internal opposition to the prince and foreign intervention weakened Galicia-Volhynia. With the end of the [[Mstislavich]] branch of the [[Dynasty of Rurik|Rurikids]] in the mid-14th century, Galicia-Volhynia ceased to exist; Poland conquered Halych; Lithuania took [[Volhynia]], including Kiev, conquered by [[Gediminas]] in 1321 [[Battle on the Irpen' River|ending the rule of Rurikids in the city]]. Lithuanian rulers then assumed the title over [[Ruthenia]].\n\n===Final disintegration===\n[[File:Kingdom of Galicia Volhynia Rus' Ukraine 1245 1349.jpg|thumb|Lilac borders: [[Kingdom of Galicia\u2013Volhynia]], one of the successor states of Kievan Rus']]\n\nThe state finally disintegrated under the pressure of the [[Mongol invasion of Rus']], fragmenting it into successor principalities who paid tribute to the [[Golden Horde]] (the so-called [[Tatar Yoke]]). In the late 15th century, the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow|Muscovite Grand Dukes]] began taking over former Kievan territories and proclaimed themselves the sole legal successors of the Kievan principality according to the protocols of the medieval theory of [[translatio imperii]].\n\nOn the western periphery, Kievan Rus' was succeeded by the [[Principality of Galicia-Volhynia]]. Later, as these territories, now part of modern central [[Ukraine]] and [[Belarus]], fell to the [[Gediminids]], the powerful, largely Ruthenized [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] drew heavily on Rus' cultural and legal traditions.

This [[princedom]] emerged from a coalition of traditional [[patriarchic]] family communes banded together in an effort to increase the applicable workforce and expand the productivity of the land. This union developed the first major cities in the Rus' and was the first notable form of self-government. As these communes became larger, the emphasis was taken off the family holdings and placed on the territory that surrounded. This shift in ideology became known as the [[verv']].\n\nIn the 11th and the 12th centuries, the princes and their retinues, which were a mixture of [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] and [[Scandinavia]]n elites, dominated the society of Kievan Rus'. Leading soldiers and officials received income and land from the princes in return for their political and military services. Kievan society lacked the class institutions and autonomous towns that were typical of [[Western Europe]]an feudalism. Nevertheless, urban [[merchant]]s, [[artisan]]s and labourers sometimes exercised political influence through a city assembly, the ''[[veche]]'' (council), which included all the adult males in the population. In some cases, the veche either made agreements with their rulers or expelled them and invited others to take their place. At the bottom of society was a stratum of [[slave]]s. More important was a class of tribute-paying [[peasant]]s, who owed labour duty to the princes. The widespread personal [[serfdom]] characteristic of Western Europe did not exist in Kievan Rus'.\n\nThe change in political structure led to the inevitable development of the peasant class or [[smerd]]y. The smerdy were free un-landed people that found work by labouring for wages on the manors that began to develop around 1031 as the verv' began to dominate socio-political structure. The smerdy were initially given equality in the Kievian law code, they were theoretically equal to the prince, so they enjoyed as much freedom as can be expected of manual labourers. However, in the 13th century, they slowly began to lose their rights and became less equal in the eyes of the law.\n\n==Historical assessment==\n[[File:Igorsvyat.jpg|thumb|''The field of [[Igor Svyatoslavich]]'s battle with the [[Polovtsy]]'', by [[Viktor Vasnetsov]]]]\n\nKievan Rus', although sparsely populated compared to Western Europe,<ref>http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/pop-in-eur.html ([https://web.archive.org/web/20100110054310/http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/pop-in-eur.html archive])</ref> was not only the largest contemporary European state in terms of area but also culturally advanced.<ref name=\"Sherman\">\n{{cite book | last = Sherman| first = Charles Phineas| authorlink = |title = Roman Law in the Modern World| origyear = | url = https://books.google.com/?id=zh6ksO3bn0YC&dq=%22Roman+Law+in+the+Modern+World%22&pg=PP7&printsec=2&lpg=PP7| accessdate = | edition = | year = 1917 | publisher = The Boston Book Company | location = Boston | page = 191 | chapter = Russia | chapterurl = https://books.google.com/books?ie=UTF-8&vid=OCLC00824429&id=zh6ksO3bn0YC&pg=PA191&lpg=PA191&dq=advanced+culture+OR+cultural+Kiev+novgorod&vq=%22Russia+became+more+advanced++in+civilization+than+any+western+European+State+of+the+period%22 | quote =\"The adoption of Christianity by Vladimir... was followed by commerce with the [[Byzantine Empire]].

[[Yaroslav the Wise]], whose stepmother belonged to the [[Macedonian dynasty]], which ruled the Byzantine empire from 867 to 1056, married the only legitimate daughter of the king who Christianized Sweden. His daughters became queens of Hungary, France and Norway, his sons married the daughters of a [[King of Poland|Polish king]] and a Byzantine emperor (not to mention a niece of the Pope), while his granddaughters were a German Empress and (according to one theory) the queen of [[Scotland]]. A grandson married the only daughter of the last [[Anglo-Saxon]] king of England. Thus the [[Rurikids]] were a well-connected royal family of the time.<ref>\"In medieval Europe, a mark of a dynasty's prestige and power was the willingness with which other leading dynasties entered into matrimonial relations with it. Measured by this standard, Yaroslav's prestige must have been great indeed... .

The most serious conflict between the two powers was the [[Sviatoslav I of Kiev#Campaigns in the Balkans|war of 968\u2013971]] in Bulgaria, but several Rus' raiding expeditions against the Byzantine cities of the Black Sea coast and Constantinople itself are also recorded. Although most were repulsed, they were concluded by [[Rus'\u2013Byzantine War (970\u2013971)|trade treaties]] that were generally favourable to the Rus'.\n\nRus'-Byzantine relations became closer following the marriage of the ''[[porphyrogenita]]'' [[Anna Porphyrogeneta|Anna]] to [[Vladimir the Great]], and the subsequent [[Christianization of Kievan Rus'|Christianization of the Rus']]: Byzantine priests, architects and artists were invited to work on numerous cathedrals and churches around Rus', expanding Byzantine cultural influence even further.

According to several chronicles after that date the predominant cult of [[Slavic paganism]] was persecuted.\n\nThe exact date of creation of the Kiev Metropolis is uncertain, as well as who was the first leader of the church. Predominantly it is considered that the first head was [[Michael I of Kiev (metropolitan)|Michael I of Kiev]], however some sources also claim Leontiy who is often placed after Michael or Anastas Chersonesos, became the first bishop of the [[Church of the Tithes]]. The first metropolitan to be confirmed by historical sources is Theopemp, who was appointed by [[Patriarch Alexius of Constantinople]] in 1038. Before 1015 there were five dioceses: Kiev, Chernihiv, Bilhorod, Volodymyr, Novgorod, and soon thereafter [[Bila Tserkva|Yuriy-upon-Ros]]. The Kiev Metropolitan sent his own delegation to the [[Council of Bari]] in 1098.\n\nAfter the sacking of Kiev in 1169, part of the Kiev metropolis started to move{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}} to [[Vladimir, Russia|Vladimir-upon-Klyazma]], concluding the move sometime after 1240 when Kiev was taken by [[Batu Khan]]. Metropolitan Maxim was the first metropolitan who chose Vladimir-upon-Klyazma as his official residence in 1299. As a result, in 1303, [[Lev I of Galicia]] petitioned [[Patriarch Athanasius I of Constantinople]] for the creation of a new Halych metropolis; however, it only existed until 1347.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\nThe [[Church of the Tithes]] was chosen as the first Cathedral Temple. In 1037, the cathedral was transferred to the newly built [[Saint Sophia Cathedral in Kiev]]. Upon the transferring of the metropolitan seat in 1299, the [[Dormition Cathedral, Vladimir]] was chosen as the new cathedral.\n\nBy the mid 13th century, the dioceses of Kiev Metropolis (988) were as follows: Kiev (988), Pereyaslav, Chernihiv (991), Volodymyr-Volynsky (992), Turov (1005), Polotsk (1104), Novgorod (~990s), Smolensk (1137), Murom (1198), Peremyshl (1120), Halych (1134), Vladimir-upon-Klyazma (1215), Rostov (991), Bilhorod, Yuriy (1032), Che\u0142m (1235), Tver (1271). There also were dioceses in [[Carpathian Ruthenia|Zakarpattia]] and [[Tmutarakan]].

The [[Primary Chronicle]] states that when Vladimir had decided to accept a new faith instead of the traditional [[Slavic mythology|idol-worship]] ([[paganism]]) of the Slavs, he sent out some of his most valued advisors and warriors as emissaries to different parts of Europe. They visited the Christians of the [[Latin Rite]], the [[Jew]]s, and the [[Muslims]] before finally arriving in Constantinople. They rejected Islam because, among other things, it prohibited the consumption of alcohol, and Judaism because the god of the Jews had permitted his [[chosen people]] to be deprived of their country. They found the ceremonies in the Roman church to be dull. But at Constantinople, they were so astounded by the beauty of the cathedral of [[Hagia Sophia]] and the liturgical service held there that they made up their minds there and then about the faith they would like to follow. Upon their arrival home, they convinced Vladimir that the faith of the [[Byzantine Rite]] was the best choice of all, upon which Vladimir made a journey to Constantinople and arranged to marry [[Anna Porphyrogenita|Princess Anna]], the sister of Byzantine emperor [[Basil II]].<ref>Janet Martin, Medieval Russia, 980\u20131584, (Cambridge, 1995), p. 6-7</ref>\n\n[[File:Eggink VelKnVladimir.jpg|thumb|left|Ivan Eggink's painting represents [[Vladimir the Great|Vladimir]] listening to the Orthodox priests, while the papal envoy stands aside in discontent.]]\n\nVladimir's choice of Eastern Christianity may also have reflected his close personal ties with Constantinople, which dominated the Black Sea and hence trade on Kiev's most vital commercial route, the [[Dnieper River]]. Adherence to the [[Eastern Church]] had long-range political, cultural, and religious consequences. The church had a [[liturgy]] written in [[Cyrillic]] and a corpus of translations from Greek that had been produced for the [[Slavic peoples]].

Yaroslav also arranged marriages for his sister and three daughters to the kings of Poland, France, Hungary and Norway. Yaroslav promulgated the first East Slavic law code, ''[[Russkaya Pravda]]''; built [[Saint Sophia Cathedral in Kiev]] and [[Saint Sophia Cathedral in Novgorod]]; patronized local clergy and [[monasticism]]; and is said to have founded a school system. Yaroslav's sons developed the great [[Kiev Pechersk Lavra]] ([[monastery]]), which functioned in Kievan Rus' as an ecclesiastical academy.\n\nIn the centuries that followed the state's foundation, [[Rurik Dynasty|Rurik's descendants]] shared power over Kievan Rus'. Princely succession moved from elder to younger brother and from uncle to nephew, as well as from father to son. Junior members of the dynasty usually began their official careers as rulers of a minor district, progressed to more lucrative principalities, and then competed for the coveted throne of Kiev.\n\n===Fragmentation and decline===\nThe gradual disintegration of the Kievan Rus' began in the 11th century, after the death of [[Yaroslav the Wise]]. The position of the [[Grand Prince of Kiev]] was weakened by the growing influence of regional clans.\n\nAn unconventional power succession system was established ([[rota system]]) whereby power was transferred to the eldest member of the ruling dynasty rather than from father to son, i.e. in most cases to the eldest brother of the ruler, fomenting constant hatred and rivalry within the royal family.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}} [[Familicide]] was frequently deployed to obtain power and can be traced particularly during the time of the Yaroslavichi (sons of Yaroslav), when the established system was skipped in the establishment of [[Vladimir II Monomakh]] as the Grand Prince of Kiev,{{Clarify|date=September 2013}}<!--Why was the established rota system 'skipped'?--> in turn creating major squabbles between [[Oleg I of Chernigov|Olegovichi]] from [[Chernihiv]], Monomakhs from [[Pereyaslav]], [[Izyaslav I of Kiev|Izyaslavichi]] from [[Principality of Turov|Turov]]/[[Volhynia]], and [[Polotsk Principality|Polotsk Princes]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}<!--This and following paragraph need to be amalgamated as they're both dealing with same subject matter.-->\n\n[[File:Kievan Nativity.jpg|thumb|''The Nativity'', a Kievan (possibly Galician) illumination from the [[Gertrude Psalter]]]]\n\nThe most prominent struggle for power was the conflict that erupted after the death of Yaroslav the Wise. The rivaling [[Principality of Polotsk]] was contesting the power of the Grand Prince by occupying Novgorod, while [[Rostislav of Tmutarakan|Rostislav Vladimirovich]] was fighting for the Black Sea port of [[Tmutarakan]] belonging to Chernihiv.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}} Three of Yaroslav's sons that first allied together found themselves fighting each other especially after their defeat to the Cuman forces in 1068 at the [[Battle of the Alta River]].

On the initiative of Vladimir II Monomakh in 1097 the first [[Council of Liubech|federal council]] of Kievan Rus took place near Chernihiv in the city of [[Liubech]] with the main intention to find an understanding among the fighting sides. However, even though that did not really stop the fighting, it certainly cooled things off.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}\n\nBy 1130, all descendants of [[Vseslav of Polotsk|Vseslav the Seer]] had been exiled to the [[Byzantine Empire]] by [[Mstislav the Great]]. The most fierce resistance to Monomakhs posed Olegovichi when the [[izgoi]] [[Vsevolod II of Kiev|Vsevolod II]] managed to become the Grand Prince of Kiev. [[Volodar of Peremyshl|Rostislavichi]] who have initially established in [[Halych]] lands by 1189 were defeated by the Monomakh-Piast descendant [[Roman the Great]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}\n\nThe decline of Constantinople&nbsp;\u2013 a main trading partner of Kievan Rus'&nbsp;\u2013 played a significant role in the decline of the Kievan Rus'. The [[trade route from the Varangians to the Greeks]], along which the goods were moving from the Black Sea (mainly [[Byzantine]]) through [[eastern Europe]] to the Baltic, was a cornerstone of Kiev wealth and prosperity. These trading routes became less important as the Byzantine Empire declined in power and Western Europe created new trading trading routes to Asia and the Near East. As people relied less on passing through Kievan Rus' territories for trade, the Kievan Rus' economy suffered.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Russia : a historical introduction from Kievan Rus' to the present|last=Thompson, John M.

After his death in 1132, the Kievan Rus' fell into recession and a rapid decline, and Mstislav's successor [[Yaropolk II of Kiev]] instead of focusing on the external threat of the [[Cumans]] was embroiled in conflicts with the growing power of the [[Novgorod Republic]]. In 1169, as the Kievan Rus' state was full of internal conflict, Andrei Bogolyubsky of Vladimir sacked the city of Kiev. The sack of the city fundamentally changed the perception of Kiev and was evidence of the fragmentation of the Kievan Rus'.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Pelenski|first=Jaroslaw|title=The Sack of Kiev of 1169: Its Significance for the Succession to Kievan Rus'|journal=Harvard Ukrainian Studies|year=1987|volume=11|pages=303\u2013316}}</ref> By the end of the 12th century, the Kievan state became even further fragmented and had been divided into roughly twelve different principalities.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Kollmann|first=Nancy|title=Collateral Succession in Kievan Rus|journal=Harvard Ukrainian Studies|year=1990|volume=14|pages=377\u2013387}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Crusades]] brought a shift in European trade routes that accelerated the decline of Kievan Rus'. In 1204, the forces of the [[Fourth Crusade]] sacked Constantinople, making the [[Dnieper River|Dnieper]] trade route marginal.<ref name=\"occawlonline.pearsoned.com\"/> At the same time, the [[Livonian Brothers of the Sword]] (of the [[Northern Crusades]]) were conquering the [[Baltic region|Baltic]] region and threatening the [[Lands of Novgorod]]. Concurrently with it, the Ruthenian Federation of Kievan Rus' started to disintegrate into smaller principalities as the Rurik dynasty grew. The local [[Orthodox Christianity]] of Kievan Rus', while struggling to establish itself in the predominantly pagan state and losing its main base in Constantinople, was on the brink of extinction. Some of the main regional centres that developed later were Novgorod, Chernigov, Halych, Kiev, Ryazan, Vladimir-upon-Klyazma, Volodimer-Volyn and Polotsk.\n\n====Novgorod Republic====\n{{Main|Republic of Novgorod}}\n\nIn the north, the [[Republic of Novgorod]] prospered because it controlled trade routes from the [[River Volga]] to the Baltic Sea. As Kievan Rus' declined, Novgorod became more independent. A local [[oligarchy]] ruled Novgorod; major government decisions were made by a town assembly, which also elected a prince as the city's military leader. In 1136, Novgorod revolted against Kiev, and became independent.{{sfn|Magocsi|2010|page=85}} Now an independent [[city state|city republic]], and referred to as \"Lord Novgorod the Great\" it would spread its \"mercantile interest\" to the west and the north; to the Baltic Sea and the low-populated forest regions respectively.{{sfn|Magocsi|2010|page=85}} In 1169, Novgorod acquired its own [[Archbishop of Novgorod|archbishop]], named [[Ilya (Archbishop of Novgorod)|Ilya]], a sign of further increased importance and political independence. Novgorod enjoyed a wide degree of autonomy although being closely associated with the Kievan Rus.\n\n====Northeast====\n{{Main|Vladimir-Suzdal}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2017}}\n[[File:Europe-1139.jpg|thumb|1139 map of the Grand Duchy of Kiev, where northeastern territories identified as the Transforrest Colonies (Zalesie) by [[Joachim Lelewel]]]]\n\nIn the northeast, Slavs from the Kievan region colonized the territory that later would become the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]] by subjugating and merging with the Finnic tribes already occupying the area. The city of [[Rostov]], the oldest centre of the northeast, was supplanted first by [[Suzdal]] and then by the city of [[Vladimir, Russia|Vladimir]], which become the capital of [[Vladimir-Suzdal']]. The combined [[principality]] of Vladimir-Suzdal asserted itself as a major power in Kievan Rus' in the late 12th century. In 1169, [[Prince Andrey Bogolyubskiy]] of Vladimir-Suzdal sacked the city of Kiev and took over the title of the (\u0412\u0435\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u041a\u043d\u044f\u0437\u044c/Velikiy Knyaz/Grand Prince or Grand Duke) to claim primacy in Rus'. Prince Andrey then installed his younger brother, who ruled briefly in Kiev while Andrey continued to rule his realm from Suzdal. In 1299, in the wake of the [[Mongol invasion of Rus|Mongol invasion]], the [[metropolitan bishop|metropolitan]] moved from Kiev to the city of Vladimir and Vladimir-Suzdal.\n\n====Southwest====\n{{Main|Kingdom of Galicia\u2013Volhynia}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2017}}\n\nTo the southwest, the principality of [[Halych]] had developed trade relations with its [[Poland|Polish]], [[Hungary|Hungarian]] and [[Lithuania]]n neighbours and emerged as the local successor to Kievan Rus'. In 1199, [[Roman the Great|Prince Roman Mstislavych]] united the two previously separate principalities of Halych and [[Volhynia|Volyn]]. In 1202 he conquered Kiev, and assumed the title of [[Knyaz]] of Kievan Rus', which was held by the rulers of Vladimir-Suzdal since 1169. His son, [[Prince Daniel]] (r. 1238\u20131264) looked for support from the West. He accepted a crown as a \"Rex Rusiae\" (\"King of Rus\") from the Roman [[papacy]], apparently doing so without breaking with Constantinople. In 1370, the patriarch of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] in Constantinople granted the King of [[Poland]] a metropolitan for his Ruthenian subjects. Lithuanian rulers also requested and received a metropolitan for Novagrudok shortly afterwards. [[Cyprian, Metropolitan of Moscow|Cyprian]], a candidate pushed by the Lithuanian rulers, became Metropolitan of Kiev in 1375 and metropolitan of Moscow in 1382; this way the church in the territory of former Kievan Rus was reunited for some time. In 1439, Kiev became the seat of a separate \"Metropolitan of Kiev, Halych and all Rus'\" for all Greek Orthodox Christians under Polish-Lithuanian rule.\n\nHowever, a long and unsuccessful struggle against the Mongols combined with internal opposition to the prince and foreign intervention weakened Galicia-Volhynia. With the end of the [[Mstislavich]] branch of the [[Dynasty of Rurik|Rurikids]] in the mid-14th century, Galicia-Volhynia ceased to exist; Poland conquered Halych; Lithuania took [[Volhynia]], including Kiev, conquered by [[Gediminas]] in 1321 [[Battle on the Irpen' River|ending the rule of Rurikids in the city]]. Lithuanian rulers then assumed the title over [[Ruthenia]].\n\n===Final disintegration===\n[[File:Kingdom of Galicia Volhynia Rus' Ukraine 1245 1349.jpg|thumb|Lilac borders: [[Kingdom of Galicia\u2013Volhynia]], one of the successor states of Kievan Rus']]\n\nThe state finally disintegrated under the pressure of the [[Mongol invasion of Rus']], fragmenting it into successor principalities who paid tribute to the [[Golden Horde]] (the so-called [[Tatar Yoke]]). In the late 15th century, the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow|Muscovite Grand Dukes]] began taking over former Kievan territories and proclaimed themselves the sole legal successors of the Kievan principality according to the protocols of the medieval theory of [[translatio imperii]].\n\nOn the western periphery, Kievan Rus' was succeeded by the [[Principality of Galicia-Volhynia]]. Later, as these territories, now part of modern central [[Ukraine]] and [[Belarus]], fell to the [[Gediminids]], the powerful, largely Ruthenized [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] drew heavily on Rus' cultural and legal traditions.

This [[princedom]] emerged from a coalition of traditional [[patriarchic]] family communes banded together in an effort to increase the applicable workforce and expand the productivity of the land. This union developed the first major cities in the Rus' and was the first notable form of self-government. As these communes became larger, the emphasis was taken off the family holdings and placed on the territory that surrounded. This shift in ideology became known as the [[verv']].\n\nIn the 11th and the 12th centuries, the princes and their retinues, which were a mixture of [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] and [[Scandinavia]]n elites, dominated the society of Kievan Rus'. Leading soldiers and officials received income and land from the princes in return for their political and military services. Kievan society lacked the class institutions and autonomous towns that were typical of [[Western Europe]]an feudalism. Nevertheless, urban [[merchant]]s, [[artisan]]s and labourers sometimes exercised political influence through a city assembly, the ''[[veche]]'' (council), which included all the adult males in the population. In some cases, the veche either made agreements with their rulers or expelled them and invited others to take their place. At the bottom of society was a stratum of [[slave]]s. More important was a class of tribute-paying [[peasant]]s, who owed labour duty to the princes. The widespread personal [[serfdom]] characteristic of Western Europe did not exist in Kievan Rus'.\n\nThe change in political structure led to the inevitable development of the peasant class or [[smerd]]y. The smerdy were free un-landed people that found work by labouring for wages on the manors that began to develop around 1031 as the verv' began to dominate socio-political structure. The smerdy were initially given equality in the Kievian law code, they were theoretically equal to the prince, so they enjoyed as much freedom as can be expected of manual labourers. However, in the 13th century, they slowly began to lose their rights and became less equal in the eyes of the law.\n\n==Historical assessment==\n[[File:Igorsvyat.jpg|thumb|''The field of [[Igor Svyatoslavich]]'s battle with the [[Polovtsy]]'', by [[Viktor Vasnetsov]]]]\n\nKievan Rus', although sparsely populated compared to Western Europe,<ref>http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/pop-in-eur.html ([https://web.archive.org/web/20100110054310/http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/pop-in-eur.html archive])</ref> was not only the largest contemporary European state in terms of area but also culturally advanced.<ref name=\"Sherman\">\n{{cite book | last = Sherman| first = Charles Phineas| authorlink = |title = Roman Law in the Modern World| origyear = | url = https://books.google.com/?id=zh6ksO3bn0YC&dq=%22Roman+Law+in+the+Modern+World%22&pg=PP7&printsec=2&lpg=PP7| accessdate = | edition = | year = 1917 | publisher = The Boston Book Company | location = Boston | page = 191 | chapter = Russia | chapterurl = https://books.google.com/books?ie=UTF-8&vid=OCLC00824429&id=zh6ksO3bn0YC&pg=PA191&lpg=PA191&dq=advanced+culture+OR+cultural+Kiev+novgorod&vq=%22Russia+became+more+advanced++in+civilization+than+any+western+European+State+of+the+period%22 | quote =\"The adoption of Christianity by Vladimir... was followed by commerce with the [[Byzantine Empire]].

[[Yaroslav the Wise]], whose stepmother belonged to the [[Macedonian dynasty]], which ruled the Byzantine empire from 867 to 1056, married the only legitimate daughter of the king who Christianized Sweden. His daughters became queens of Hungary, France and Norway, his sons married the daughters of a [[King of Poland|Polish king]] and a Byzantine emperor (not to mention a niece of the Pope), while his granddaughters were a German Empress and (according to one theory) the queen of [[Scotland]]. A grandson married the only daughter of the last [[Anglo-Saxon]] king of England. Thus the [[Rurikids]] were a well-connected royal family of the time.<ref>\"In medieval Europe, a mark of a dynasty's prestige and power was the willingness with which other leading dynasties entered into matrimonial relations with it. Measured by this standard, Yaroslav's prestige must have been great indeed... .

The most serious conflict between the two powers was the [[Sviatoslav I of Kiev#Campaigns in the Balkans|war of 968\u2013971]] in Bulgaria, but several Rus' raiding expeditions against the Byzantine cities of the Black Sea coast and Constantinople itself are also recorded. Although most were repulsed, they were concluded by [[Rus'\u2013Byzantine War (970\u2013971)|trade treaties]] that were generally favourable to the Rus'.\n\nRus'-Byzantine relations became closer following the marriage of the ''[[porphyrogenita]]'' [[Anna Porphyrogeneta|Anna]] to [[Vladimir the Great]], and the subsequent [[Christianization of Kievan Rus'|Christianization of the Rus']]: Byzantine priests, architects and artists were invited to work on numerous cathedrals and churches around Rus', expanding Byzantine cultural influence even further.

According to several chronicles after that date the predominant cult of [[Slavic paganism]] was persecuted.\n\nThe exact date of creation of the Kiev Metropolis is uncertain, as well as who was the first leader of the church. Predominantly it is considered that the first head was [[Michael I of Kiev (metropolitan)|Michael I of Kiev]], however some sources also claim Leontiy who is often placed after Michael or Anastas Chersonesos, became the first bishop of the [[Church of the Tithes]]. The first metropolitan to be confirmed by historical sources is Theopemp, who was appointed by [[Patriarch Alexius of Constantinople]] in 1038. Before 1015 there were five dioceses: Kiev, Chernihiv, Bilhorod, Volodymyr, Novgorod, and soon thereafter [[Bila Tserkva|Yuriy-upon-Ros]]. The Kiev Metropolitan sent his own delegation to the [[Council of Bari]] in 1098.\n\nAfter the sacking of Kiev in 1169, part of the Kiev metropolis started to move{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}} to [[Vladimir, Russia|Vladimir-upon-Klyazma]], concluding the move sometime after 1240 when Kiev was taken by [[Batu Khan]]. Metropolitan Maxim was the first metropolitan who chose Vladimir-upon-Klyazma as his official residence in 1299. As a result, in 1303, [[Lev I of Galicia]] petitioned [[Patriarch Athanasius I of Constantinople]] for the creation of a new Halych metropolis; however, it only existed until 1347.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\nThe [[Church of the Tithes]] was chosen as the first Cathedral Temple. In 1037, the cathedral was transferred to the newly built [[Saint Sophia Cathedral in Kiev]]. Upon the transferring of the metropolitan seat in 1299, the [[Dormition Cathedral, Vladimir]] was chosen as the new cathedral.\n\nBy the mid 13th century, the dioceses of Kiev Metropolis (988) were as follows: Kiev (988), Pereyaslav, Chernihiv (991), Volodymyr-Volynsky (992), Turov (1005), Polotsk (1104), Novgorod (~990s), Smolensk (1137), Murom (1198), Peremyshl (1120), Halych (1134), Vladimir-upon-Klyazma (1215), Rostov (991), Bilhorod, Yuriy (1032), Che\u0142m (1235), Tver (1271). There also were dioceses in [[Carpathian Ruthenia|Zakarpattia]] and [[Tmutarakan]]. In 1261 the Sarai-Batu diocese was established.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Old Russian Chronicles]]\n*[[De Administrando Imperio]]\n*[[Slavic studies]]\n*[[Kievan Rus' Park]]\n*[[Mother of Rus' cities]]\n*[[Symbols of the Rurikids]]\n\n; History\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-break}}\n{{History of Belarus}}\n{{col-break}}\n{{History of Russia}}\n{{col-break}}\n{{History of Ukraine}}\n{{col-end}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{NoteFoot}}\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |last = Magocsi |first = Paul R. |author-link = Paul Robert Magocsi |title = A History of Ukraine: The Land and Its Peoples |year = 2010 |publisher = University of Toronto Press |location = Toronto |isbn = 978-1442610217 |ref = harv }}\n* {{loc}} \u2013 [http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/rutoc.html Russia]\n{{refend}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*[[David Christian (historian)|Christian, David]].

The rear camera has a 48 MP Sony IMX 586 primary sensor along with a 5 MP depth sensor.\n\n==== OnePlus 7T and OnePlus 7T Pro ====\n{{Main|OnePlus 7T}}\n\nThe OnePlus 7T was officially presented in New Delhi on September 26, 2019, and was available to order on September 28. The OnePlus 7T Pro was unveiled two weeks later. The OnePlus 7T is the successor to the 7 that was released 5 months prior for the European and Asian market, and to the 6T for the American market where the OnePlus 7 wasn't sold. It features a new form-factor compared to its predecessors, with a 20:9 aspect ratio instead of 19.5:9. This allowed for OnePlus to make the phone slightly taller than the older 6T and 7, while keeping the same width. OnePlus also included the 90&nbsp;Hz Fluid AMOLED display previously found on the OnePlus 7 Pro. While OnePlus did keep the resolution at 2400\u00d71080 pixels, the screen was one of its primary selling points. While the OnePlus 7T is considered a significant upgrade compared to the 7, the 7T Pro is a subtle upgrade over the 7 Pro. It features the same display, same body, same camera system; the main changes being faster charging, faster processor and a slightly quieter pop-up camera.\n\nBoth phones are powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon 855+ SoC and feature the same in-display fingerprint scanner found on the OnePlus 7 Series. Only one variant was available for each phone: 8 GB RAM with 128GB storage for the 7T (with another 256 GB storage variant for the Indian market only), and 8 GB RAM with 256 GB storage for the 7T Pro. Both have a slightly superior battery compared to their predecessors, the 7T included a 3800 mAh non-removable battery (4085 mAh for the 7T Pro) alongside Warp Charge 30T technology, which allows them to be fully charged in just under an hour. The OnePlus 7T had a new camera system, featuring the same primary and [[wide-angle lens]]es, though adding a third 2x telephoto lens (instead of 3x for the 7 Pro and 7T Pro). Both also feature a new macro mode, allowing them to capture pictures up to 2.5&nbsp;cm from to the subject. The more affordable OnePlus 7T is available in 2 colors, \"Frosted\" silver or \"Glacier\" blue, and the 7T Pro in \"Haze\" blue, all being matte glass finishes. Both were the first phones to ship with [[Android 10]] and OxygenOS 10.0 out-of-the-box.\n\n==== OnePlus 8 and 8 Pro ====\n{{Main|OnePlus 8}}\n\nThe OnePlus 8 and OnePlus 8 Pro were unveiled on April 14, 2020, and will be available on April 21 in Europe and April 29 in the United States. The 8 Pro is the first OnePlus phone to have true water resistance (IP68) and wireless charging (Warp Charge 30W). The 8 and 8 Pro have a circular cutout in the upper left-hand corner of the display for the front-facing camera. On the 8 Pro, this was necessary to achieve the IP68 rating, like the pop-up camera on the 7 Pro and 7T Pro did not allow for water resistance. Like the 7T series, both use Fluid [[AMOLED]] displays with a high refresh rate and HDR10+ support. A curved display is now used on both phones, but the 8 Pro has a higher refresh rate. The 8 has a 6.55-inch 1080p 20:9 screen with a 90Hz refresh rate, while the 8 Pro has a larger 6.78-inch 1440p 19.8:9 screen with a 120Hz refresh rate. The 8 Pro is one of the first smartphones able to display 1 billion colors using a [[Color depth|30-bit]] panel.\n\nBoth phones are powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon 865 and carry over the optical in-display fingerprint scanner from the 7 series and 7T series. The battery capacity has been increased to 4300 mAh on the 8 and 4510 mAh on the 8 Pro. Storage and RAM options are identical between the two, with 8 or 12 GB of RAM and 128 or 256 GB of non-expandable UFS 3.0 storage. The 8 has LPDDR4X RAM while the 8 Pro has newer LPDDR5 RAM. The camera system has been changed to further differentiate the 8 and 8 Pro. Unlike the 7T, the 8 does not have a telephoto camera, making this a feature exclusive to the 8 Pro; instead, it has a new macro lens. The 8 Pro's ultrawide sensor receives a boost in resolution from 16 MP to 48 MP, but its telephoto sensor does not receive significant upgrades. The front camera on both uses a 16 MP sensor. Both will be available in Onyx Black and Glacial Green and will receive their own color. The 8 has an Interstellar Glow finish, while the 8 Pro has an Ultramarine Blue finish. A Polar Silver finish on the 8 is exclusive to the Verizon model. Like the 7T series, they will ship with [[Android 10]] and OxygenOS 10.0 pre-installed.\n\n==== Variants ====\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

The primary improvements to this 2nd generation are the sound quality (using a 10mm driver instead of a 7.2mm one in the Bullets Wireless v1), better battery life and charging speed (Warp Charge compatible), as well as a new design which removed the need of earhooks, while still fitting comfortably in the ears and not falling on their own.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/14/18622832/oneplus-bullets-wireless-2-price-release-date|title=The OnePlus Bullets Wireless 2 are better and more expensive|last=Savov|first=Vlad|date=2019-05-14|website=The Verge|access-date=2019-08-23}}</ref>\n\n=== TVs ===\n\n==== OnePlus TV ====\nIn September 2018, the company confirmed<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://eoto.tech/oneplus-tv-wont-sell/|title=Here's why the OnePlus TV won't sell in India - EOTO Tech {{!}} OnePlus TV Price in India|date=17 September 2018|work=EOTO Tech|access-date=25 September 2018|language=en-US}}</ref> it plans to venture into the smart TVs market with the OnePlus TV.

It was unveiled on 22 April 2014, and was claimed as the \"2014 Flagship Killer.\" The One had comparable, and in some ways better, specifications to other flagship phones of the year, while being sold at a significantly lower price at $299 for the 16 GB version or $349 for the 64 GB version.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://oneplus.net/press-releases/oneplus-launches-2014-flagship-killer-the-oneplus-one|title=Press Releases - OnePlus|website=oneplus.net|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170818045439/https://oneplus.net/press-releases/oneplus-launches-2014-flagship-killer-the-oneplus-one|archivedate=18 August 2017}}</ref>\n\nOnePlus One issue with yellow display band at the bottom of the screen which affected some units were not covered under warranty.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.phonearena.com/news/OnePlus-accused-of-not-honoring-warranty-on-yellow-screen-issue_id58139 |title=OnePlus accused of not honoring warranty on yellow screen issue |publisher=Phone Arena|accessdate=1 July 2017 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://forums.oneplus.net/threads/yellow-band-what-a-reply-from-vikas-during-ama-on-reddit-yesterday.201250/ |title=OnePlus Forums: Reply from @vikas during OnePlus official AMA on Reddit |publisher=OnePlus Forums |accessdate=1 July 2017 }}</ref>\n\n==== OnePlus 2 ====\n{{Main|OnePlus 2}}\nThe [[OnePlus 2]] was the successor to the company's highly successful first phone. It was unveiled a little over a year after the One, on 27 July 2015. It was highly promoted as \"2016 Flagship killer\".<!--2016 is correct, do not change it 2015--> There were very high expectations for the second generation OnePlus phones, partly because the company managed to create a high amount of hype for the upcoming phone. One of the marketing channels used was YouTube tech reviewer [[MKBHD]] who was sent a unit, which he covered in detail leading up to the launch.\n\nThe OnePlus 2 had specifications comparable to other flagship phones of the time, including the [[Qualcomm]] [[Snapdragon 810]], though OnePlus had decided to leave out an [[Near Field Communication|NFC]] chip, as it didn't see mobile payment being an essential feature at the time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.androidpolice.com/2015/07/27/oneplus-says-it-dropped-nfc-from-the-oneplus-2-because-oneplus-one-owners-werent-using-it/|title=OnePlus Says It Dropped NFC From The OnePlus 2 Because OnePlus One Owners Weren't Using It|date=27 July 2015|publisher=}}</ref> The phone was also one of the first [[Android (operating system)|Android]] devices to sport a [[USB-C]] port over the older [[Micro usb|micro USB]] port.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gizmotimes.com/lists/smartphones-with-usb-type-c-connectivity/6520|title=List of phones with usb type c connectivity (as of June 2016)|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nIn advance of the OnePlus 2 launch, OnePlus assured customers that obtaining invites would be easier, and handsets would ship a lot quicker than with the OnePlus One.

The 3 was the company's first \"metal unibody\" phone.

Like the predecessor, they come with an optical in-display fingerprint sensor. The front camera has a 16 MP sensor. They launched with Android 9.0 Pie and OxygenOS 9.5.0.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/news/oneplus-8-pro-5g-device-lineup-2020-launch-ceo-pete-lau-2115258|title=OnePlus 8 Series Could Be Launched With 5G, CEO Pete Lau Says|website=NDTV Gadgets 360|language=en|access-date=2019-10-11}}</ref>\n\nThe OnePlus 7 Pro features a curved edge-to-edge 6.67\" 19.5:9 FLUID AMOLED display with a 3K resolution (3120\u00d71440 pixels) and 90&nbsp;Hz refresh rate. It comes in three variants: 6 GB RAM with 128 GB storage, 8 GB RAM with 256 GB storage and 12 GB RAM option with 256 GB storage. The OnePlus 7 Pro also features a 4000 mA\u22c5h non-removable battery along with Warp Charge 30 technology.<ref>https://www.oneplus.com/ae/7pro#/</ref><ref>https://www.oneplus.com/ae/7</ref>\n\nThe budget OnePlus 7 which was launched with the flagship Pro version, comes in two colors, \"Mirror\" grey and red. It is available in 6 GB RAM with 128 GB of internal storage, or 8 GB RAM with 128 or 256 GB of internal storage. It features a 6.41 inches FHD+ Optic Amoled Display (2340\u00d71080 pixels resolution). The rear camera has a 48 MP Sony IMX 586 primary sensor along with a 5 MP depth sensor.\n\n==== OnePlus 7T and OnePlus 7T Pro ====\n{{Main|OnePlus 7T}}\n\nThe OnePlus 7T was officially presented in New Delhi on September 26, 2019, and was available to order on September 28. The OnePlus 7T Pro was unveiled two weeks later. The OnePlus 7T is the successor to the 7 that was released 5 months prior for the European and Asian market, and to the 6T for the American market where the OnePlus 7 wasn't sold. It features a new form-factor compared to its predecessors, with a 20:9 aspect ratio instead of 19.5:9. This allowed for OnePlus to make the phone slightly taller than the older 6T and 7, while keeping the same width. OnePlus also included the 90&nbsp;Hz Fluid AMOLED display previously found on the OnePlus 7 Pro. While OnePlus did keep the resolution at 2400\u00d71080 pixels, the screen was one of its primary selling points. While the OnePlus 7T is considered a significant upgrade compared to the 7, the 7T Pro is a subtle upgrade over the 7 Pro. It features the same display, same body, same camera system; the main changes being faster charging, faster processor and a slightly quieter pop-up camera.\n\nBoth phones are powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon 855+ SoC and feature the same in-display fingerprint scanner found on the OnePlus 7 Series. Only one variant was available for each phone: 8 GB RAM with 128GB storage for the 7T (with another 256 GB storage variant for the Indian market only), and 8 GB RAM with 256 GB storage for the 7T Pro. Both have a slightly superior battery compared to their predecessors, the 7T included a 3800 mAh non-removable battery (4085 mAh for the 7T Pro) alongside Warp Charge 30T technology, which allows them to be fully charged in just under an hour. The OnePlus 7T had a new camera system, featuring the same primary and [[wide-angle lens]]es, though adding a third 2x telephoto lens (instead of 3x for the 7 Pro and 7T Pro). Both also feature a new macro mode, allowing them to capture pictures up to 2.5&nbsp;cm from to the subject. The more affordable OnePlus 7T is available in 2 colors, \"Frosted\" silver or \"Glacier\" blue, and the 7T Pro in \"Haze\" blue, all being matte glass finishes. Both were the first phones to ship with [[Android 10]] and OxygenOS 10.0 out-of-the-box.\n\n==== OnePlus 8 and 8 Pro ====\n{{Main|OnePlus 8}}\n\nThe OnePlus 8 and OnePlus 8 Pro were unveiled on April 14, 2020, and will be available on April 21 in Europe and April 29 in the United States. The 8 Pro is the first OnePlus phone to have true water resistance (IP68) and wireless charging (Warp Charge 30W). The 8 and 8 Pro have a circular cutout in the upper left-hand corner of the display for the front-facing camera. On the 8 Pro, this was necessary to achieve the IP68 rating, like the pop-up camera on the 7 Pro and 7T Pro did not allow for water resistance. Like the 7T series, both use Fluid [[AMOLED]] displays with a high refresh rate and HDR10+ support. A curved display is now used on both phones, but the 8 Pro has a higher refresh rate. The 8 has a 6.55-inch 1080p 20:9 screen with a 90Hz refresh rate, while the 8 Pro has a larger 6.78-inch 1440p 19.8:9 screen with a 120Hz refresh rate. The 8 Pro is one of the first smartphones able to display 1 billion colors using a [[Color depth|30-bit]] panel.\n\nBoth phones are powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon 865 and carry over the optical in-display fingerprint scanner from the 7 series and 7T series. The battery capacity has been increased to 4300 mAh on the 8 and 4510 mAh on the 8 Pro. Storage and RAM options are identical between the two, with 8 or 12 GB of RAM and 128 or 256 GB of non-expandable UFS 3.0 storage. The 8 has LPDDR4X RAM while the 8 Pro has newer LPDDR5 RAM. The camera system has been changed to further differentiate the 8 and 8 Pro. Unlike the 7T, the 8 does not have a telephoto camera, making this a feature exclusive to the 8 Pro; instead, it has a new macro lens. The 8 Pro's ultrawide sensor receives a boost in resolution from 16 MP to 48 MP, but its telephoto sensor does not receive significant upgrades. The front camera on both uses a 16 MP sensor. Both will be available in Onyx Black and Glacial Green and will receive their own color. The 8 has an Interstellar Glow finish, while the 8 Pro has an Ultramarine Blue finish.
