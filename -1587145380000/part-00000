He is chief counsellor of the play's villain, [[King Claudius|Claudius]], and the father of [[Laertes (character)|Laertes]] and [[Ophelia (character)|Ophelia]]. Generally regarded as wrong in every judgment he makes over the course of the play,<ref>{{ws |'[[s:Characters of Shakespeare's Plays/Hamlet|Hamlet]]' in William Hazlitt, ''Characters of Shakespeare's Plays''}}</ref> Polonius is described by [[William Hazlitt]] as a \"sincere\" father, but also \"a busy-body, [who] is accordingly officious, garrulous, and impertinent\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/468193/Polonius |title=Polonius at Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |work=[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]] |accessdate=10 July 2014}}</ref> In Act II, [[Prince Hamlet|Hamlet]] refers to Polonius as a \"tedious old fool\"<ref>{{ws |Hamlet Act II scene ii \u2013 William Shakespeare}}</ref> and taunts him as a latter day \"[[Jephtha]]\".<ref>2.2.346</ref>\n\nPolonius connives with Claudius to spy on Hamlet. Hamlet unknowingly kills Polonius, provoking Ophelia's descent into madness, ultimately resulting in her suicide and the climax of the play: a duel between Laertes and Hamlet.\n\n==Character==\nFather of [[Ophelia (character)|Ophelia]] and [[Laertes (character)|Laertes]], and counselor to [[King Claudius]], he is described as a windbag by some and a rambler of wisdom by others. It has also been suggested that he only acts like a \"foolish prating knave\" to keep his position and popularity safe and to keep anyone from discovering his plots for social advancement. It is important to note that throughout the play, Polonius is characterised as a typical [[Renaissance]] \"new man\", who pays much attention to appearances and ceremonious behaviour. Some adaptations show him conspiring with Claudius in the murder of [[King Hamlet]].\n\nIn Act 1, Scene 3, Polonius gives advice to his son Laertes, who is leaving for France, in the form of a list of sententious maxims. He finishes by giving his son his blessing, and is apparently at ease with his son's departure. However, in Act 2, Scene 1, he orders his servant Reynaldo to travel to Paris and spy on Laertes and report if he is indulging in any local vice.\n\nLaertes is not the only character Polonius spies upon. He is fearful that Hamlet's relationship with his daughter will hurt his reputation with the king and instructs Ophelia to \"lock herself from [Hamlet's] resort\".  He later suspects that Ophelia's rejection of Hamlet's attention has caused the prince to lose his wits, and informs [[Gertrude (Hamlet)|Gertrude]] and Claudius of his suspicion, claiming that his reason for commanding Ophelia to reject Hamlet was that the prince was above her station. He and the king test his hypothesis by spying on and interrogating Ophelia.\n\nIn his last attempt to spy on Hamlet, Polonius hides himself behind an [[tapestry|arras]] in Gertrude's room.  Hamlet deals roughly with his mother, causing her to cry for help. Polonius echoes the request for help and is heard by Hamlet, who then mistakes the voice for Claudius' and stabs through the arras and kills him.\n\nPolonius' death at the hands of Hamlet causes Claudius to fear for his own life, Ophelia to go mad, and Laertes to seek revenge, which leads to the duel in the final act.\n\n==Sources==\nThe literary origins of the character may be traced to the King's counselor found in the [[Belleforest]] and [[William Painter (author)|William Painter]] versions of the Hamlet legend. However, at least since the 19th century scholars have also sought to understand the character in terms of [[Elizabethan England|Elizabethan]] court politics.\n\nPolonius was first proposed as a parody of [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth]]'s leading counsellor, [[Lord Treasurer]], and Principal Secretary [[William Cecil, Lord Burghley]] in 1869.<ref>{{cite book|last=French|first=George Russell|url=http://www.sourcetext.com/sourcebook/essays/polonius/texts.html|chapter=Notes on Hamlet|title=Shakspeareana Genealogica|publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]]|location=London, England|date=1869|pages=299-310|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081010231838/http://www.sourcetext.com/sourcebook/essays/polonius/texts.html |archive-date=10 October 2008 }}</ref> [[Israel Gollancz]] also suggested that Polonius might have been a satire on Burghley.

Various suggestions have been made to explain this. [[George Richard Hibbard|G. R. Hibbard]] argues that the name was originally ''Polonius'', but was changed because Q1 derives from a version of the play to be performed in Oxford and Cambridge, and the original name was too close to that of [[Robert Pullen|Robert Polenius]], founder of Oxford University. Since Polonius is a parody of a pompous pseudo-intellectual, the name might have been interpreted as a deliberate insult.<ref name = \"hibb\">G. R. Hibbard (ed), ''Hamlet'', Oxford University Press, 1998, p.69-75.</ref> The title page of Q1 specifically states that the play was recently performed in London, Oxford and Cambridge.\n\n==Stage and film portrayals==\nIn most productions of the 20th century, up to about 1980, Polonius was played as a somewhat [[senile]], garrulous man of about seventy-five or so, eliciting a few laughs from the audience by the depiction. More recent productions have tended to play him as a slightly younger man, and to emphasise his shiftiness rather than pompous senility, harking back to the traditional manner in which Polonius was played before the 20th century. Until the 1900s there was a tradition that the actor who plays Polonius also plays the quick-witted gravedigger in Act V. This bit suggests that the actor who played Polonius was an actor used to playing clowns much like the Fool in ''[[King Lear]]'': not a doddering old fool, but an alive and intelligent master of illusion and misdirection. Polonius adds a new dimension to the play and is a controlling and menacing character.\n\nOne key to the portrayal is a producer's decision to keep or remove the brief scene with his servant, Reynaldo, which comes after his scene of genial, fatherly advice to Laertes. He instructs Reynaldo to spy on his son, and even suggest that he has been gambling and consorting with prostitutes, to find out what he has really been up to. The inclusion of this scene portrays him in a much more sinister light; most productions, including [[Laurence Olivier]]'s [[Hamlet (1948 film)|1948 film version]], choose to remove it. The respective productions starring [[Richard Burton (actor)|Richard Burton]] and [[Kenneth Branagh]] both include it. Although [[Hume Cronyn]] plays Polonius mostly for laughs in the [[Hamlet (1964 film)|Burton production]], Polonius is more sinister than comic in [[Hamlet (1996 film)|Branagh's version]].\n\n==Famous lines==\nPolonius's most famous lines are found in Act 1 Scene 3 (\"Neither a borrower nor a lender be\"; \"To thine own self be true\") and Act 2 Scene 2 (\"Brevity is the soul of wit\"; and \"Though this be madness, yet there is method in't\") while others have become paraphrased aphorisms (\"Clothes make the man\"; \"Old friends are the best friends\"). Also, the line he speaks when he is killed by Hamlet in Act 3 scene 4 (\"O, I am slain!\") has been subject to parody and ridicule due to its obviousness.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.opensourceshakespeare.org/views/plays/characters/charlines.php?CharID=polonius&WorkID=hamlet |title=See all of Polonius's lines |website=Opensourceshakespeare.org |accessdate=10 July 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Notable portrayals==\n\n*[[Hume Cronyn]] won a [[Tony Award]] for playing Polonius opposite [[Richard Burton]]'s [[Hamlet]] in [[John Gielgud]]'s 1964 [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] production.

No other actor has ever won an award for playing Polonius in any professional American stage version of ''Hamlet'', nor for playing him in a film version of the play.\n*In \"[[The Producer]]\", a 1966 episode of ''[[Gilligan's Island]]'', Polonius' \"Neither a borrower nor a lender be\" speech is performed satirically, first by series regular [[Alan Hale Jr.]] as [[The Skipper]] playing the role of Polonius (with [[Dawn Wells]] as [[Mary Ann Summers|Mary Ann]] playing Laertes) in a musical production of ''Hamlet'' by the castaways, then by [[Phil Silvers]] guest-starring as a famous stage producer who finds himself on the island.<ref name=\"Abele2013\">{{cite book|first=Elizabeth|last=Abele|title=Home Front Heroes: The Rise of a New Hollywood Archetype, 1988\u20131999|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=83MmAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA187|date=20 November 2013|publisher=[[McFarland & Company|McFarland]]|location=Jefferson, North Carolina|isbn=978-0-7864-7333-5|page=187}}</ref>\n*Actors who have played Polonius on film and television include [[Hans Junkermann (actor)|Hans Junkermann]], [[Ian Holm]], [[Michael Redgrave]], [[Ian Richardson]], [[Oliver Ford Davies]], [[Bill Murray]], and [[Richard Briers]].\n\n==References==\n{{Portal|England|Theatre}}\n{{Commonscat|Polonius (person)|Polonius}}\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Hamlet}}\n\n[[Category:Characters in Hamlet]]\n[[Category:Fictional viziers]]\n[[Category:Fictional nobility]]\n[[Category:Fictional Danish people]]\n[[Category:Male Shakespearean characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional actors]]\n[[Category:Fictional murdered people in literature]]\n", "name_user": "Momosaburo", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eName", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polonius"}

This palm reproduces sexually via seed as well as asexually when new plants sprout from the base of older plants.  Flower stalks are either male or female, but both occur in the same group of plants.  After releasing pollen, male stalks wither.  If female flowers are pollinated, the stalks turn a bright orange color as the seeds mature.  A small, attractive, trunkless, clumping palm, it grows to about {{convert|2|m|ft|abbr=on}} high, and {{convert|2.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} across, with glossy, dark green leaves, and long thin leaflets. It will eventually form quite a large dense, clump given time. (It is occasionally used as a hedge plant.) This trunkless habit, along with its flexible long thin leaflets is an adaption that allows as little resistance as possible to flowing water, helping to prevent it from being washed away during floods. As the trunk grows, it creeps across the ground helping to anchor the plant even more securely against the forces of water.\n\nImmature fruit is ovoid, shiny and dark green.
