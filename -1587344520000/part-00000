When wrapped in multiple layers, the upper layers have a tendency to crush the lower layers, while the lower layers have a tendency to pinch upper layers. The rubbing of rope against rope also has a tendency to cause wear.\nThese problems were addressed by Frank L. LeBus Sr., a supplier of drilling equipment to the oilfields of Texas, USA, who in 1938, patented the use of a groove bar on hoisting drums to guide the spooling of rope. Grooved shape steel segments were simply welded or screwed to existing plain steel drums.<ref>George F LeBus, [https://www.google.com/patents/US2204938 US Patent 2204938]</ref> \nEver since then, drum groovings have been widely used to guide the spooling of wire rope onto and off winch drums.\nIntroducing a continuous helical groove onto the drum, like the thread of a screw, provides a way to guide the rope when spooling onto or off a drum. However this has been shown to work effectively only when the rope is wrapped in a single layer. When the rope is wrapped in multiple layers, problems remain.\nFrank LeBus introduced a grooving pattern that put the groove parallel to the flanges of the drum, except for a single slanted section across the drum face to act as crossover point, moving the rope along by the width of the groove with every revolution.\n\nWhile the Lebus family business continues to produce this equipment today, patents have expired and other [[winch]] manufacturers also use the Lebus system. Any drum with a parallel groove and two cross-over points is often generically called \u2018a Lebus drum\u2019, regardless of the manufacturer.\n\n==Applications==\n\nThe multilayer wire rope spooling system has undergone continuous refinement over the years and adapted for any application where long lengths of steel wire ropes must be wrapped in multiple layers quickly and smoothly. Examples include:\n* Cranes for construction sites, offshore [[oil platform|oil rigs]], ports or onboard ships \n* Deep mining\n* Winches aboard [[oceanography|Oceanographic]] [[research vessels]] and pipelaying barges\n* Winches aboard [[fishing vessels]].\n* [[Funicular railway]]s and [[Cable railway|cable car]]s\n\n==System advantages==\n\nWith the parallel groove system, rope wear is considerably reduced in multilayer spooling. \n[[File:Seiltrommeln1.jpg|thumb|Winch drums for multilayer wire rope Spooling]]\n\nWhen the first layer has filled the drum, the second layer then travels back across the drum with each wrap of rope sitting precisely along the groove of two wraps of the first layer.\nWith parallel grooving it is possible to calculate the exact forces that the rope imposes on the drum because the spooling is controlled. \n[[File:Mehrlagen-Seilspulung-Prinzip2.jpg|thumb|Multilayer wire rope Spooling Pic 1]]\n\nCross winding is reduced to approximately 20% of the circumference of the drum, and 80% remains parallel to the flanges in the inner layer rope groove.\nThis parallel grooving evenly distributes the load between the individual layers and has been shown to increase substantially \u2013 by more than 500%, tests have shown \u2013 the life of the wire rope. The system has been used to mount ropes up. \n[[File:Mehrlagen-Seilspulung-Prinzip3.jpg|thumb|Multilayer wire rope Spooling Pic 2]]\n\nIn offshore applications, huge lengths of rope are often housed on drums. The anchor winches on Saipem's Semac 1 pipe laying barge, for example, each hold 2,800 metres of 76mm (3 inch) diameter wire rope in 14 layers. Saipem's Castorone, the world's largest pipe laying vessel uses a wire rope that is 3,850m long and 152mm in diameter. It weighs 420t.  The rope is pulled by capstan and stored on a massive Rema [[traction winches]] that feature the parallel grooving system, with an approximately back tension of 40t on the capstan.\n[[File:Mehrlagen-Seilspulung-Prinzip4.jpg|thumb|Multilayer wire rope Spooling Pic 3]]\n\n==Required operating parameters==\n\nTo maximise the benefits of the parallel grooving system, certain operating conditions are required. These include:\n;Application-specific design\nEvery system should be tailored to the application for which it is used. The groove pattern is engineered to suit the rope's length, diameter and construction type.\n;Spooling under tension\nIn any multi-layer spooling application it is important that when the rope is first installed on the drum, it is done so under tension to avoid any slack on inner layers that can be crushed or nicked against the groove walls by outer layers.\n;Correct fleet angle\nThe fleet angle is defined as the largest angle of the rope between the first sheave and the drum flange, relative to the centre line of the drum. With all type of drums, the rope is subject to a fleet angle which impacts on its behaviour and affects lifespan. \nFleet angle should be between 0.25\u00b0 and 1.25\u00b0, depending on the rope construction. The fleet angle can be varied by moving the first sheave closer to or further away from the drum. If the sheave is too close to the drum, the fleet angle will be greater than 1.25\u00b0; if it is too far away, the fleet angle will be less than 0.25\u00b0.\n\n==Accessories==\n\nSometimes it is not possible to achieve the optimum fleet angle. Where there is no space to rig a sheave the requisite distance from the drum, two additional spooling devices are available. One is a fleet angle compensator, which is driven automatically by the rope tension. The other is a level winder that is mechanically driven. Both offer a solution to guide the cable along the drum between flanges, but each has its advantages and disadvantages.\n\n==Fleet angle compensator==\n\nThe fleet angle compensator (FAC) is driven by the movement of the wire rope as it goes through the crossover sections of the drum. As the rope winds or unwinds, the FAC shaft automatically oscillates slowly, allowing its sheave to slide back and forth across the shaft to maintain an optimum fleet angle and guide the rope smoothly onto the drum.\n[[File:SeilwindeKompensator.jpg|thumb|Fleet angle compensator for winch drum]]\n\n==Screw level winder==\n\nLevel winders can be hydraulically or electrically driven and computer controlled, or they can be simple mechanical devices. A mechanical level winder comprises a main shaft (the lead screw) with [[helical screw]] grooving along which the rope feeder travels. The rope feeder housing includes two vertical roller bars and one horizontal roller, or alternatively a wire rope sheave. The lateral movement of the housing is generated by a chain drive sprocket ratio between drum and lead screw, as shown in the image. The automatic level winder fitted is designed and engineered to be compatible with the grooving on the drum.\nAlternatively, a sheave can be integrated and installed within the housing frame. In this case, the system can be set up anywhere around the drum. \nOceanographic installations that spool rope up to 46 layers have demonstrated that level winders give synchronized and controlled spooling in the harshest, most testing conditions.\n[[File:Seilwinde-Kreuzgewindespindel.jpg|thumb|Winch drum with screw level winder]]\n\n==Split sleeves==\n\nGrooving systems for multilayer spooling can be carved onto steel shells that are mounted onto old drums, by either bolting or welding, as an outer sleeve. Called split sleeves, they can be retrofitted onto old drums or mounted on new drums to allow a future change of application.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* Erh\u00f6hung der Seillebensdauer bei der Mehrlagenwicklung in Kranen; AiF-Vorhaben 14862 N/1, University of Stuttgart, (pdf, February 19, 2013)\n* Rudolf Becker.

With all type of drums, the rope is subject to a fleet angle which impacts on its behaviour and affects lifespan. \nFleet angle should be between 0.25\u00b0 and 1.25\u00b0, depending on the rope construction. The fleet angle can be varied by moving the first sheave closer to or further away from the drum. If the sheave is too close to the drum, the fleet angle will be greater than 1.25\u00b0; if it is too far away, the fleet angle will be less than 0.25\u00b0.\n\n==Accessories==\n\nSometimes it is not possible to achieve the optimum fleet angle. Where there is no space to rig a sheave the requisite distance from the drum, two additional spooling devices are available. One is a fleet angle compensator, which is driven automatically by the rope tension. The other is a level winder that is mechanically driven. Both offer a solution to guide the cable along the drum between flanges, but each has its advantages and disadvantages.\n\n==Fleet angle compensator==\n\nThe fleet angle compensator (FAC) is driven by the movement of the wire rope as it goes through the crossover sections of the drum. As the rope winds or unwinds, the FAC shaft automatically oscillates slowly, allowing its sheave to slide back and forth across the shaft to maintain an optimum fleet angle and guide the rope smoothly onto the drum.\n[[File:SeilwindeKompensator.jpg|thumb|Fleet angle compensator for winch drum]]\n\n==Screw level winder==\n\nLevel winders can be hydraulically or electrically driven and computer controlled, or they can be simple mechanical devices. A mechanical level winder comprises a main shaft (the lead screw) with [[helical screw]] grooving along which the rope feeder travels. The rope feeder housing includes two vertical roller bars and one horizontal roller, or alternatively a wire rope sheave. The lateral movement of the housing is generated by a chain drive sprocket ratio between drum and lead screw, as shown in the image. The automatic level winder fitted is designed and engineered to be compatible with the grooving on the drum.\nAlternatively, a sheave can be integrated and installed within the housing frame. In this case, the system can be set up anywhere around the drum. \nOceanographic installations that spool rope up to 46 layers have demonstrated that level winders give synchronized and controlled spooling in the harshest, most testing conditions.\n[[File:Seilwinde-Kreuzgewindespindel.jpg|thumb|Winch drum with screw level winder]]\n\n==Split sleeves==\n\nGrooving systems for multilayer spooling can be carved onto steel shells that are mounted onto old drums, by either bolting or welding, as an outer sleeve. Called split sleeves, they can be retrofitted onto old drums or mounted on new drums to allow a future change of application.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* Erh\u00f6hung der Seillebensdauer bei der Mehrlagenwicklung in Kranen; AiF-Vorhaben 14862 N/1, University of Stuttgart, (pdf, February 19, 2013)\n* Rudolf Becker.

Whilst it is true that his father worked at a hospital, and also factual that Gatiss based his experiences on times spent growing up around that hospital, the truth is that his father, worked at a now long-gone mental hospital (similar to Winterton) in School Aycliffe, some ten or so miles to the west of Winterton.

Several complaints have been made against him to the [[Canadian Broadcast Standards Council]] (CBSC). In a 1994 complaint to the CBSC, listeners alleged that Green had been rude and abusive to a caller who identified herself as a Christian. Although the CBSC determined that Green's conduct had contravened its guidelines on discrimination, it also decided that the station had responded appropriately, and the group did not prescribe any further action. In 2006 and 2008, the council censured Green for his treatment of a Muslim man who challenged Green on the way the radio show host portrays Islam.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2009/090206a.php|title=Archived copy|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101121203806/http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2009/090206a.php|archivedate=21 November 2010|accessdate=2010-11-30|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2006/061215.php|title=Archived copy|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008202250/http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2006/061215.php|archivedate=8 October 2011|accessdate=2009-08-07|df=dmy-all}}</ref>  In June 2017, there was controversy as to whether [[Indigo Books and Music]] had pulled Green's latest book, ''Amazing But True!'', from its bookshelves in stores in Canada.<ref>{{cite news|last=Johnston|first=Geoffrey|url=http://www.thewhig.com/2017/06/01/author-battles-censorship|title=Author battles 'censorship'|date=1 June 2017|newspaper=The Kingston Whig-Standard|accessdate=12 July 2017}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://www.facebook.com/lgreen.ca/ Lowell Green at Facebook]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20090212100107/http://cbsc.ca/english/decisions/1994/940604.php 1994 decision]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20111008202250/http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2006/061215.php 2006 decision]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20101121203806/http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2009/090206a.php 2009 decision]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Green, Lowell}}\n[[Category:1936 births]]\n[[Category:Canadian non-fiction writers]]\n[[Category:Canadian people of Irish descent]]\n[[Category:Canadian talk radio hosts]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:McGill University alumni]]\n[[Category:Ontario Liberal Party candidates in Ontario provincial elections]]\n[[Category:Writers from Ann Arbor, Michigan]]\n[[Category:Writers from Ottawa]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Canadian radio personality}}\n{{Use Canadian English|date=February 2013}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2013}}\n{{Infobox presenter\n|name        = Lowell Green\n|alias       = \n|image       = Lowell Green.jpg|<nowiki>Lowell Green]]</nowiki>\n|image_size  = \n|caption     = \n|birth_name  = \n|birth_date  = {{Birth date and age|df=yes|1936|07|07}}\n|birth_place = [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]], [[USA]]\n|death_date  = \n|death_place = \n|show        = ''The Lowell Green Show''\n|station     = [[CFRA (AM)|CFRA]] Ottawa\n|timeslot    = Weekdays 10 am to 12pm\n|show2       = \n|station2    = \n|timeslot2   = \n|style       = [[Talk radio]]\n|country     = Canada\n|prevshow    = Greenline\n|website     = \n|spouse      = Deborah Green\n|awards      = }}\n\n'''Lowell Green''' (born 7 July 1936) is a Canadian radio personality, journalist, and author, best known as the host of ''The Lowell Green Show'', a conservative morning [[talk show]] that aired on the [[Ottawa]] [[Ontario]] radio station [[CFRA]].

Several complaints have been made against him to the [[Canadian Broadcast Standards Council]] (CBSC). In a 1994 complaint to the CBSC, listeners alleged that Green had been rude and abusive to a caller who identified herself as a Christian. Although the CBSC determined that Green's conduct had contravened its guidelines on discrimination, it also decided that the station had responded appropriately, and the group did not prescribe any further action. In 2006 and 2008, the council censured Green for his treatment of a Muslim man who challenged Green on the way the radio show host portrays Islam.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2009/090206a.php|title=Archived copy|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101121203806/http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2009/090206a.php|archivedate=21 November 2010|accessdate=2010-11-30|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2006/061215.php|title=Archived copy|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008202250/http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2006/061215.php|archivedate=8 October 2011|accessdate=2009-08-07|df=dmy-all}}</ref>  In June 2017, there was controversy as to whether [[Indigo Books and Music]] had pulled Green's latest book, ''Amazing But True!'', from its bookshelves in stores in Canada.<ref>{{cite news|last=Johnston|first=Geoffrey|url=http://www.thewhig.com/2017/06/01/author-battles-censorship|title=Author battles 'censorship'|date=1 June 2017|newspaper=The Kingston Whig-Standard|accessdate=12 July 2017}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://www.facebook.com/lgreen.ca/ Lowell Green at Facebook]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20090212100107/http://cbsc.ca/english/decisions/1994/940604.php 1994 decision]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20111008202250/http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2006/061215.php 2006 decision]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20101121203806/http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2009/090206a.php 2009 decision]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Green, Lowell}}\n[[Category:1936 births]]\n[[Category:Canadian non-fiction writers]]\n[[Category:Canadian people of Irish descent]]\n[[Category:Canadian talk radio hosts]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:McGill University alumni]]\n[[Category:Ontario Liberal Party candidates in Ontario provincial elections]]\n[[Category:Writers from Ann Arbor, Michigan]]\n[[Category:Writers from Ottawa]]\n", "name_user": "WildStar", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eBibliography:Changed heading to Books.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowell_Green"}

Banki case==\nIn January 2010, Banki was arrested and prosecuted by the United States Attorney's office in New York City. He was charged with violating US sanctions against Iran. He spent 22 months in prison before winning his case on appeal in the [[Second Circuit Court of Appeals]], with all the sanctions charges against him being dismissed.\n\n===Case background===\nBanki's family lived in Iran and through the early 2000s with his parents' marriage was falling apart, the family decided to send a portion of the family assets to the US.<ref name=\"Times\">[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/13/nyregion/13hawala.html?_r=0 \"To Defendant, a U.S. Success Story; to Prosecutors, a Money Broker to Iran\" by Benjamin Weiser, [[New York Times]], May 12, 2010]</ref> Between 2006 and 2009 Banki's family sent proceeds of his parents' divorce settlement (approximately $3.4 million) to him, from Iran to the US. The money came into a single bank account at [[Bank of America]], over multiple transfers through an informal money transfer systems which the defendant argued was legal and the only means of sending money out of Iran at the time. Banki used the majority of this money to purchase an apartment in downtown Manhattan.\n\nProsecutors argued that over this three-year period Banki had violated the sanctions imposed by the US on Iran. The indictment accused Banki of violating the sanctions law, running an informal underground bank, and helping \"manage, supervise, operate, and conduct\" an unlicensed money transmittal service through which he directly or indirectly facilitated and violated the Iran sanctions. In essence, the charges against Banki stemmed from prosecution allegations that he, as an American citizen, had violated US sanctions on Iran.\n\n====Sanctions history====\nThe United States enforces sanctions against several countries worldwide.<ref>[[United States embargoes|\"United States Embargoes\"]]</ref> These sanctions are instituted by the Office of Foreign Assets Control ([[OFAC]]) under the [[United States Department of the Treasury|Department of Treasury]] of the United States.\n\nUS treasury's OFAC designates family money as exempt from the sanctions law.<ref name=\"Sanctions\">[http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/programs/documents/iran.pdf \"What you need to know about U.S. Economic Sanctions\", by U.S. Department of the Treasury Office of Foreign Assets Control ]</ref>\n\nA detailed letter by former head of Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), Richard Newcomb, to the court during the case of US v. Banki outlined the sanctions regiment and intent; undermining the prosecutor's case against Banki as not being in line with the practices of OFAC or the intent of the sanctions. Nor were the charges in line with the agency's approach while Richard Newcomb was head of the agency:\n\n\"The underlying purpose for these multiple U.S. economic sanctions programs against Iran was to target the Government with the use of economic methods to change the behavior of the leadership in Iran toward the United States and the international community at large, and to thwart Iran's support for and funding of terrorism, its efforts to disrupt the Middle East Peace Process and its development of weapons of mass destruction. Central to the effort was to direct and focus the sanctions impact on the Government of Iran, its leadership, its various agencies, instrumentalities, controlled entities and support structure, including Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps, and other such organizations necessary for the support and continuation of the current Governmental hierarchy. The industrial and commercial sectors - oil and gas, financial, manufacturing and other sectors that contribute significantly to Iran's economy and the Government's ability to continue its threatening behavior were also of primary concern. The program goal was never intended to target the Iranian people. The Iranian Diaspora is large. As many as 4 million or more Iranians live as expats around the world. It is estimated that there are as many as 800,000 Iranian nationals currently resident in the United States as dual nationals, green card holders or with other visa status. A very large percentage are supporters of U.S. policy toward Iran, and it is the goal of the U.S. government to continue cultivating that support while isolating the government of Iran. In virtually all economic sanctions programs administered by OFAC (with the exception of the. 1963 program against Cuba where Cuban nationals were also included as targets), including the Iran sanctions program, it was always understood that there was a dual goal and purpose - to bring as much economic pressure as possible to bear on the intended target without causing unintended hardship and suffering on the civilian population, the very people whose support and assistance the U.S. and the international community will need if and when a successor government emerges.\"<ref name=\"Support\">[http://rezastory.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/MRezaBanki_RichardNewcombLetter.pdf?iframe=true Former Head of OFAC's letter in support of Mahmoud Reza Banki]</ref>\n\n===Arrest, indictment and charges===\nOn January 7th, 2010, [[U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement]] (ICE)  agents authorized by a grand jury with a search and arrest warrant entered the residence of Mahmoud Reza Banki in New York City and arrested him.<ref>[https://www.justice.gov/archive/usao/nys/pressreleases/January10/bankimahmoudrezaarrestindictmentpr.pdf \"Manhattan U.S. Attorney Charges Management Consultant For Criminal Violations Of Iran Trade Embargo\", January 7, 2010 ]</ref> He was arraigned before Judge [[John F. Keenan]] on an indictment charging him with three counts: 1. Conspiracy to violate the U.S.-imposed Iran sanctions and conspiracy to run an unlicensed money transmittal system, 2. Violation of the Iran sanctions, and 3. Running of an unlicensed money transmittal business.<ref name=\"Indictment\">[http://rezastory.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/MRezaBanki_Indictment.pdf?iframe=true Indictment against Mahmoud Reza Banki]</ref> The indictment accused Banki of receiving $4.7 million in violation of the Iran sanctions.

Judge [[John F. Keenan]] asserted that there was \"no combination of conditions would ensure Banki's appearance in court\" and denied bail multiple times despite securing guarantees of millions of dollars in bond. Nine attorneys and close friends volunteered to put up their homes as collateral on Banki's behalf for his bail package. But the judge did not see any monetary amount that could satisfy the bail conditions in his opinion.\n\n===Trial at the District Court and forfeiture===\nThe indictment charging Banki argued that Banki should have gotten authorization in the form of a license for the money he received:\n\"(vi) Under the ITR, any United States person who wishes to engage in a transaction otherwise prohibited by the ITR must first file an application for a license and receive approval from OFAC. 31 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 56.600, 560.501, and 501.801.\".<ref name=\"Indictment\" />\n\nBanki did not have a license for the money he received. Judge [[John F. Keenan]] denied the Banki's defense request to instruct the jury on the law that specifically permits family money as an exception to the sanctions law, permitting such transfers without the need for a license:\n\"However, U.S. depository institutions are permitted to handle funds transfers, through intermediary third-country banks, to or from Iran or for the direct or indirect benefit of the Government of Iran or a person in Iran, arising from several types of underlying transactions, including:\na) a noncommercial family remittance;\nb) an exportation to Iran or importation from Iran of information and informational materials;\nc) a travel-related remittance;\nd) a payment for the shipment of a donation of articles to relieve human suffering; or\ne) a transaction authorized by OFAC through a specific or general license.\".<ref name=\"Sanctions\" />\n \nOn May 10, 2010 a three-week trial commenced where Second Circuit District judge [[John F. Keenan]] presided. The trial concluded on June 4 when the jury returned a guilty verdict on all five counts, albeit, guilty on a lesser charge of aiding and abetting rather than running a sanctions violation money transmittal system.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/05/nyregion/05hawala.html?_r=0 \"Immigrant Convicted of Violating Iran Embargo\", by Benjamin Weiser, [[New York Times]], June 4, 2010]</ref>\n\nOn June 7, 2010, despite the superseding indictment charge of $3.4 million, the same jury agreed to forfeit one bank account associated with a $6,000 transaction as the proceeds of the charges and the guilty verdict. The jury ruled that Mahmoud Reza Banki's other assets including the apartment he had purchased with the family funds he had received was not a direct proceed of any crime and not forfeitable.\n\nJudge [[John F.

Essentially, the jury was not told that transfer of family money is legal; that family money can be sent to and received from Iran and is an exception in the US sanctions law against Iran. This would become a material issue at the appellate level and the primary reason for the reversal of the charges.\n\nJudge Keenan also did not allow the defense to call Richard Newcomb, former head of OFAC, to testify as an expert witness on the sanctions charges despite his qualifications: he had been head of OFAC for 17 years (from 1987 to 2004), where he was the author of the sanctions law.

Banki case==\nIn January 2010, Banki was arrested and prosecuted by the United States Attorney's office in New York City. He was charged with violating US sanctions against Iran. He spent 22 months in prison before winning his case on appeal in the [[Second Circuit Court of Appeals]], with all the sanctions charges against him being dismissed.\n\n===Case background===\nBanki's family lived in Iran and through the early 2000s with his parents' marriage was falling apart, the family decided to send a portion of the family assets to the US.<ref name=\"Times\">[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/13/nyregion/13hawala.html?_r=0 \"To Defendant, a U.S. Success Story; to Prosecutors, a Money Broker to Iran\" by Benjamin Weiser, [[New York Times]], May 12, 2010]</ref> Between 2006 and 2009 Banki's family sent proceeds of his parents' divorce settlement (approximately $3.4 million) to him, from Iran to the US. The money came into a single bank account at [[Bank of America]], over multiple transfers through an informal money transfer systems which the defendant argued was legal and the only means of sending money out of Iran at the time. Banki used the majority of this money to purchase an apartment in downtown Manhattan.\n\nProsecutors argued that over this three-year period Banki had violated the sanctions imposed by the US on Iran. The indictment accused Banki of violating the sanctions law, running an informal underground bank, and helping \"manage, supervise, operate, and conduct\" an unlicensed money transmittal service through which he directly or indirectly facilitated and violated the Iran sanctions. In essence, the charges against Banki stemmed from prosecution allegations that he, as an American citizen, had violated US sanctions on Iran.\n\n====Sanctions history====\nThe United States enforces sanctions against several countries worldwide.<ref>[[United States embargoes|\"United States Embargoes\"]]</ref> These sanctions are instituted by the Office of Foreign Assets Control ([[OFAC]]) under the [[United States Department of the Treasury|Department of Treasury]] of the United States.\n\nUS treasury's OFAC designates family money as exempt from the sanctions law.<ref name=\"Sanctions\">[http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/programs/documents/iran.pdf \"What you need to know about U.S. Economic Sanctions\", by U.S. Department of the Treasury Office of Foreign Assets Control ]</ref>\n\nA detailed letter by former head of Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), Richard Newcomb, to the court during the case of US v. Banki outlined the sanctions regiment and intent; undermining the prosecutor's case against Banki as not being in line with the practices of OFAC or the intent of the sanctions. Nor were the charges in line with the agency's approach while Richard Newcomb was head of the agency:\n\n\"The underlying purpose for these multiple U.S. economic sanctions programs against Iran was to target the Government with the use of economic methods to change the behavior of the leadership in Iran toward the United States and the international community at large, and to thwart Iran's support for and funding of terrorism, its efforts to disrupt the Middle East Peace Process and its development of weapons of mass destruction. Central to the effort was to direct and focus the sanctions impact on the Government of Iran, its leadership, its various agencies, instrumentalities, controlled entities and support structure, including Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps, and other such organizations necessary for the support and continuation of the current Governmental hierarchy. The industrial and commercial sectors - oil and gas, financial, manufacturing and other sectors that contribute significantly to Iran's economy and the Government's ability to continue its threatening behavior were also of primary concern. The program goal was never intended to target the Iranian people. The Iranian Diaspora is large. As many as 4 million or more Iranians live as expats around the world. It is estimated that there are as many as 800,000 Iranian nationals currently resident in the United States as dual nationals, green card holders or with other visa status. A very large percentage are supporters of U.S. policy toward Iran, and it is the goal of the U.S. government to continue cultivating that support while isolating the government of Iran. In virtually all economic sanctions programs administered by OFAC (with the exception of the. 1963 program against Cuba where Cuban nationals were also included as targets), including the Iran sanctions program, it was always understood that there was a dual goal and purpose - to bring as much economic pressure as possible to bear on the intended target without causing unintended hardship and suffering on the civilian population, the very people whose support and assistance the U.S. and the international community will need if and when a successor government emerges.\"<ref name=\"Support\">[http://rezastory.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/MRezaBanki_RichardNewcombLetter.pdf?iframe=true Former Head of OFAC's letter in support of Mahmoud Reza Banki]</ref>\n\n===Arrest, indictment and charges===\nOn January 7th, 2010, [[U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement]] (ICE)  agents authorized by a grand jury with a search and arrest warrant entered the residence of Mahmoud Reza Banki in New York City and arrested him.<ref>[https://www.justice.gov/archive/usao/nys/pressreleases/January10/bankimahmoudrezaarrestindictmentpr.pdf \"Manhattan U.S. Attorney Charges Management Consultant For Criminal Violations Of Iran Trade Embargo\", January 7, 2010 ]</ref> He was arraigned before Judge [[John F.

Nine attorneys and close friends volunteered to put up their homes as collateral on Banki's behalf for his bail package. But the judge did not see any monetary amount that could satisfy the bail conditions in his opinion.\n\n===Trial at the District Court and forfeiture===\nThe indictment charging Banki argued that Banki should have gotten authorization in the form of a license for the money he received:\n\"(vi) Under the ITR, any United States person who wishes to engage in a transaction otherwise prohibited by the ITR must first file an application for a license and receive approval from OFAC. 31 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 56.600, 560.501, and 501.801.\".<ref name=\"Indictment\" />\n\nBanki did not have a license for the money he received. Judge [[John F.
