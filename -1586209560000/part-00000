The company originally intended to design [[flight simulator]]s for the [[aircraft]] industry, but it shifted to the amusement rides after an early simulator, called Orientator, became a popular pay-per-ride attraction with the public. The company manufactured rides until 1985, and a 1988 lawsuit forced the company into bankruptcy in 1990.\n\n== Aircraft manufacturing ==\nLee Eyerly founded Eyerly Aircraft Company in 1930 to manufacture two inexpensive ways to train pilots which he devised when the [[Great Depression]] hit. The first was the Whiffle Hen,<ref name=\"oahof\">{{cite web |url=http://oregonaviation.org/hall-of-fame/ | title=Oregon Aviation Hall of Fame | work=Oregon Aviation Historical Society | accessdate=2015-07-12}}</ref> a plane which only burned two US gallons (8 L) of fuel per hour of flight. The second was a ground-based flight training device patented under the name \"Orientator\". The Orientator consisted of a small airplane suspended in what looked like the tines of a giant tuning fork. Air from the electrically driven propeller passed over the wings and rudder, and the operator controlled the movements of the plane in a manner similar to a real aircraft.<ref name=\"billboard651\">{{Cite journal | title = Eyerlys Keep Eyes in Air for Well-Grounded Ideas | author = Abbott, Sam | work = The Billboard | date = June 30, 1951 | accessdate = 2015-07-12 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8h4EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA91&lpg=PA91&source=bl&ots=xISdAOR0zk&sig=xa4Sf75hO9poBrr48W-QQ9C0ypQ&hl=en&sa=X&ei=f3WjVeOoBMLtoASZgp-YDQ&ved=0CFEQ6AEwCTgK#v=onepage | page = 91 }}</ref> The Orientator was produced commercially and eventually renamed the [[Acroplane]].\n\n== Amusement rides ==\nA salesman approached Eyerly about selling them to carnivals and parks as an amusement ride after noticing several Acroplanes stored on the lot outside Eyerly's shop. While Eyerly was initially skeptical, he agreed to a deal which led to selling about 50 Acroplanes as an amusement ride. The following year, Eyerly changed the company's focus from aircraft to amusement rides based on the successful sales.<ref name=\"billboard651\" /> Eyerly developed and patented numerous amusement rides which would become staples of carnival midways, including The [[Loop-O-Plane]] (1933),<ref name=\"billboard651\" /><ref>{{cite journal | journal=Western Flying Magazine | title=Eyerly Invents \"Loop-O-Plane\" | volume=13 | month= | year=1933 | publisher=Occidental Publishing Company | page=24}}</ref> the [[Roll-O-Plane]],<ref name=\"dcj539\">{{cite news|title=Loop-o-Plane, Octopus and Rolloplane |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/2798530/daily_capital_journal/|newspaper=Daily Capital Journal|date=May 6, 1939|page=12|via = [[Newspapers.com]]|accessdate = July 12, 2015}} {{Open access}}</ref> the [[Fly-O-Plane]] and the [[Rock-O-Plane]] (1947).<ref name=\"are-rocko\">{{Cite web | title = Rock O Plane | publisher = Amusement Ride Extravaganza | work = ride-extravaganza.com | accessdate = 2015-07-12 |url=http://www.ride-extravaganza.com/thrill/rock-o-plane/ }}</ref><ref name=\"la-rocko\">{{Cite web | title = Rock-O-Plane | publisher = Lewellen Amusements | work = lewellenamusements.com | accessdate = 2015-07-12 |url=http://www.lewellenamusements.com/Rock.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100324161405/http://www.lewellenamusements.com/Rock.html |archivedate=March 24, 2010}}</ref> Perhaps their most popular design was the [[Octopus (ride)|Octopus]],<ref name=\"dcj539\" /> which resulted in later variations: the [[Spider (ride)|Spider]] and the [[Monster (ride)|Monster]].

The company originally intended to design [[flight simulator]]s for the [[aircraft]] industry, but it shifted to the amusement rides after an early simulator, called Orientator, became a popular pay-per-ride attraction with the public. The company manufactured rides until 1985, and a 1988 lawsuit forced the company into bankruptcy in 1990.\n\n== Aircraft manufacturing ==\nLee Eyerly founded Eyerly Aircraft Company in 1930 to manufacture two inexpensive ways to train pilots which he devised when the [[Great Depression]] hit. The first was the Whiffle Hen,<ref name=\"oahof\">{{cite web |url=http://oregonaviation.org/hall-of-fame/ | title=Oregon Aviation Hall of Fame | work=Oregon Aviation Historical Society | accessdate=2015-07-12}}</ref> a plane which only burned two US gallons (8 L) of fuel per hour of flight. The second was a ground-based flight training device patented under the name \"Orientator\". The Orientator consisted of a small airplane suspended in what looked like the tines of a giant tuning fork. Air from the electrically driven propeller passed over the wings and rudder, and the operator controlled the movements of the plane in a manner similar to a real aircraft.<ref name=\"billboard651\">{{Cite journal | title = Eyerlys Keep Eyes in Air for Well-Grounded Ideas | author = Abbott, Sam | work = The Billboard | date = June 30, 1951 | accessdate = 2015-07-12 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8h4EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA91&lpg=PA91&source=bl&ots=xISdAOR0zk&sig=xa4Sf75hO9poBrr48W-QQ9C0ypQ&hl=en&sa=X&ei=f3WjVeOoBMLtoASZgp-YDQ&ved=0CFEQ6AEwCTgK#v=onepage | page = 91 }}</ref> The Orientator was produced commercially and eventually renamed the [[Acroplane]].\n\n== Amusement rides ==\nA salesman approached Eyerly about selling them to carnivals and parks as an amusement ride after noticing several Acroplanes stored on the lot outside Eyerly's shop. While Eyerly was initially skeptical, he agreed to a deal which led to selling about 50 Acroplanes as an amusement ride. The following year, Eyerly changed the company's focus from aircraft to amusement rides based on the successful sales.<ref name=\"billboard651\" /> Eyerly developed and patented numerous amusement rides which would become staples of carnival midways, including The [[Loop-O-Plane]] (1933),<ref name=\"billboard651\" /><ref>{{cite journal | journal=Western Flying Magazine | title=Eyerly Invents \"Loop-O-Plane\" | volume=13 | month= | year=1933 | publisher=Occidental Publishing Company | page=24}}</ref> the [[Roll-O-Plane]],<ref name=\"dcj539\">{{cite news|title=Loop-o-Plane, Octopus and Rolloplane |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/2798530/daily_capital_journal/|newspaper=Daily Capital Journal|date=May 6, 1939|page=12|via = [[Newspapers.com]]|accessdate = July 12, 2015}} {{Open access}}</ref> the [[Fly-O-Plane]] and the [[Rock-O-Plane]] (1947).<ref name=\"are-rocko\">{{Cite web | title = Rock O Plane | publisher = Amusement Ride Extravaganza | work = ride-extravaganza.com | accessdate = 2015-07-12 |url=http://www.ride-extravaganza.com/thrill/rock-o-plane/ }}</ref><ref name=\"la-rocko\">{{Cite web | title = Rock-O-Plane | publisher = Lewellen Amusements | work = lewellenamusements.com | accessdate = 2015-07-12 |url=http://www.lewellenamusements.com/Rock.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100324161405/http://www.lewellenamusements.com/Rock.html |archivedate=March 24, 2010}}</ref> Perhaps their most popular design was the [[Octopus (ride)|Octopus]],<ref name=\"dcj539\" /> which resulted in later variations: the [[Spider (ride)|Spider]] and the [[Monster (ride)|Monster]].

Wales conceded only two tries in the entire tournament, halving the previous record of four tries conceded by England in both [[2002 Six Nations Championship|2002]] and [[2003 Six Nations Championship|2003]].<ref name=\"08GS\">{{cite news|url=http://icwales.icnetwork.co.uk/rugbynation/rugby-news/2008/03/16/wales-prove-they-re-grand-masters-91466-20629966/ |title=Wales prove they're Grand masters |publisher=Wales On Sunday |date=16 March 2008 |accessdate=2 May 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222023101/http://icwales.icnetwork.co.uk/rugbynation/rugby-news/2008/03/16/wales-prove-they-re-grand-masters-91466-20629966/ |archivedate=22 February 2014 }}</ref>\n\nIn the [[2008 end-of-year rugby union tests|2008 end-of-year]] Tests Wales were defeated by both New Zealand and South Africa, but claimed wins over Canada and Australia.

It was sponsored by [[Nabisco]] and originally aired December 6, 1995 on [[CBS]].\n\nThe special was based on a 1963 book of the same name, by Robert Barry. In 2005, ''Mr. Willowby's Christmas Tree'' was adapted into a children's theater stage production by the [[Way Off Broadway Dinner Theatre]].\n\n==Plot==\nThe special begins with the song \u201cThe Perfect Tree,\u201d which features both Mr. Willowby ([[Robert Downey Jr.]]) singing about his desire to find the perfect [[Christmas tree]] and, within Willowby\u2019s house, a father [[mouse]] singing that he will go out to get a tree for his family (his two children, Beverly and Ned, decide to come with him). After the song is finished, Willowby asks his [[butler]], Baxter ([[Leslie Nielsen]]) where his tree is.\n\nThe special then follows the family of mice out in the woods looking for a tree. Eventually, the father mouse spots \u201cthe perfect tree,\u201d but it is far too large to fit into their tiny living quarters, so the family climbs the tree so that he can chop off the very top. Right when they reach the top, however, Willowby\u2019s [[lumberjack]]s arrive at the scene and cut the entire tree down (as they sing the song \u201cWe\u2019re Lumberjacks\u201d). The family of mice hold on to the tree as it is brought to Willowby\u2019s house.\n\nThe tree is set up in the house, and Willowby notices it is slightly too tall. He has Baxter cut off the very top, and then tells him to bring up the top part of the tree (which the mouse family is in) to one of his staff, Swedish maid Miss Adelaide (Channing), whom Willowby describes as being a very lonely person who doesn\u2019t even come down for Christmas. However, this is part of Mr. Willowby's hidden agenda of getting Baxter and Adelaide to admit their secret love for each other.\n\nBaxter does so, and while he is meeting with Adelaide, she describes her family\u2019s traditions at Christmas time. While they are talking, a romantic interest between the two of them is insinuated. At one point, Baxter notices the father mouse on the floor, but Adelaide says it is Christmastime and thus would be wrong to kill the mouse at this time. She places the mouse up on a banister, and he returns to the top of the tree with his children.\n\nAfter Baxter leaves, Adelaide notices that the tree in her room is slightly too tall, so she cuts off the top and throws it out the window (with the mouse family in it). Before the father mouse can cut off the top, a [[bear]] picks up the tree and brings it home to her den and family to use as his own Christmas tree.\n\nThe bears engage in their Christmas festivities, and eventually notice that the tree is too tall. They cut off the top (which once again has the mice in it) and throw it outside. The family of mice laugh at all they\u2019ve been through that evening, only to then be picked up (along with the remnants of the tree) by an [[owl]].\n\nMeanwhile back at the manor, Mr. Willowby is piling gifts around the tree, but notices he doesn't hear Baxter anywhere. To his great satisfaction, he quickly finds the butler standing in the snow underneath Miss Adelaide's window, listening to her sing.\n\nThe owls set up the tree in their own den, and then engage in an angelic chorus (the mouse family speculates that they never knew owls could be so musical). Eventually, they too notice that the tree they have is too tall, and so they cut off the top and throw it (along with the mice) outside.\n\nThe father mouse then raises his axe to cut off a tree from the remnants that have been thrown outside, but then realizes that the tree as it is actually the perfect size for his own home. He and the other mice return to the manor. But Baxter catches Beverly by the tail, grousing over the possible mouse infestation. Fortunately at that moment, Willowby\u2019s Christmas Ball is about to begin, and as the guests arrive, he hears Miss Adelaide leaving her room. Knowing how she would feel, he releases Beverly and tells her to \"Hurry home for Christmas.\" The mice race into their den with the tree, cheering that their Christmas can begin.\n\nMeanwhile, Mr. Willowby's Christmas party is in full swing. Adelaide comes down this time, and begins to dance with Baxter. With Mr. Willowby joining their dance for a moment, he turns to gaze upon the tree, and launches into a final rendition of \"The Perfect Tree\".\n\nThe show ends with our narrarator Kermit The Frog leaving the darkened manor at party's end, wishing the audience Happy Holidays and good night. As the credits roll, Ned and Beverly begin relating their adventure to their mother while father dozes by the fireplace.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Robert Downey Jr.]] as Mr. Willowby\n* [[Stockard Channing]] as Miss Adelaide\n* [[Leslie Nielsen]] as Baxter the Butler\n\n===Muppet performers===\n* [[Bill Barretta]] as Bear\n* [[Julianne Buescher]] as Beverly Mouse\n* [[Steve Whitmire]] as Bear, [[Kermit the Frog]], Owl\n* [[Kevin Clash]] as Father Mouse, Owl\n* [[Bruce Lanoil]] as Owl, Bear\n* [[David Rudman]] as Ned Mouse\n\n==Accolades==\nScore- and songwriters Patty and Michael Silversher were nominated for an Emmy for the song \u201cThe Perfect Tree.\u201d The special also won a [[Casting Society of America]] award for \u201cBest Casting for TV Nighttime Special\u201d.<ref>http://imdb.com/title/tt0124013/awards</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{muppets}}\n* {{imdb title|0124013|Mr. Willowby\u2019s Christmas Tree}}\n\n{{The Jim Henson Company}}\n{{The Muppets}}\n\n[[Category:1995 television specials]]\n[[Category:1995 television films]]\n[[Category:1990s American television specials]]\n[[Category:American Christmas films]]\n[[Category:Christmas television specials]]\n[[Category:The Muppets television specials]]\n[[Category:CBS television specials]]\n[[Category:The Jim Henson Company]]\n[[Category:Kermit the Frog]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox television\n| show_name            = Mr. Willowby's Christmas Tree\n| image                = \n| image_size           = \n| image_alt            = \n| caption              = \n| based_on             = ''Mr. Willowby's Christmas Tree'' by Robert Barry\n| writer               = [[Mitchell Kriegman]]\n| story                = \n| director             = [[Jon Stone]]\n| narrated             = [[Kermit the Frog]]\n| starring             = [[Robert Downey Jr.]]<br>[[Stockard Channing]]<br>[[Leslie Nielsen]]\n| music                = [[Silversher & Silversher|Michael & Patty Silversher]]\n| country              = United States\n| language             = English\n| executive_producer   = [[Michael K.

Osgood stood 5\u20139, weighed 173, and was an elusive runner. [[Pudge Heffelfinger]], the legendary All-American from [[Yale University]], gave this description of Osgood: \"It was downright uncanny to watch him run, opponents missed him by inches. His body undulated like a snake's. He was the [[Red Grange]] of the pioneer era.\"<ref name=\"CAN\" />\n[[File:1892 Cornell varsity football team.jpg|thumb|left|1892 Cornell varsity football team: Osgood is the 2nd from the left in the front row.]]\n\n===Cornell===\nAt Cornell, Osgood received a medal as the school's best all-around athlete.

He was commissioned a major in the artillery under General [[Calixto Garcia]]. Early in October 1896, the Cuban General Garcia  and General [[Maximo Gomez]] joined forces and moved upon Guimaro, which was strongly fortified and defended by the [[Spaniards]]. After much hard fighting and a brilliant charge led by  Colonel [[Mario Garc\u00eda Menocal]], the largest fortification was taken.<ref name=\"CAN\" /> During the battle, Major Osgood was in charge of shelling several blockhouses with a [[Hotchkiss gun|Hotchkiss rifle]] using 12-pound shells.   Osgood's artillery unit was under steady fire from small arms. When Osgood stooped over the gun to adjust the sight to account for the wind, he made the remark, \u201cthink that will do.\u201d   At that moment, he was hit by a bullet fired by a sharp-shooter stationed in the church tower eleven hundred yards away.

He was talented in many sports but is best known for his exploits as an [[College Football All-America Team|All-American]] football player.  Osgood stood 5\u20139, weighed 173, and was an elusive runner. [[Pudge Heffelfinger]], the legendary All-American from [[Yale University]], gave this description of Osgood: \"It was downright uncanny to watch him run, opponents missed him by inches. His body undulated like a snake's.

He saw action in the [[Second World War]] and rose to the rank of vice-admiral, despite being demoted three times in his career.\n\nBorn in 1908, Kulakov initially began studying in [[Kiev]] for a career as a railway worker, before coming into contact with the navy through the local [[Komsomol]]. Joining the navy in 1932, he entered the political branch, serving as a [[Political commissar|military commissar]] on several vessels, before sitting on the Military Councils of the [[Northern Fleet|Northern]] and then the [[Black Sea Fleet]]s.  Serving on the Black Sea during the start of the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of the Soviet Union]] in 1941, Kulakov took part in planning the defences of the Black Sea ports, and when they were overwhelmed, the counterattacks. The heavy human cost of these brought the Military Council under investigation and Kulakov suffered his first demotion, from rear-admiral to [[captain 1st rank]], and reassignment.\n\nReturned to useful work and restored to his former rank by the Navy's commander in chief, [[Nikolay Kuznetsov (officer)|Nikolay Kuznetsov]], Kulakov repaid Kuznetsov by acting as his prosecutor in a trial on charges of giving away military secrets, and succeeded in having Kuznetsov demoted. Kulakov himself was demoted shortly afterwards for \"unsatisfactory leadership of party political work\", but once more returned to prominence and former rank with service with the Black Sea Fleet. Implicated in the loss of the battleship [[Soviet battleship Novorossiisk|''Novorossiisk'']] in 1955, Kulakov was demoted for a third time and transferred to the [[Baltic Fleet]]. Here he rebuilt his career in the navy's political department once more, returning to the rank of vice-admiral and being awarded the title of [[Hero of the Soviet Union]]. He retired in 1971 and died in 1976.\n\n==Early life==\nKulakov was born on {{OldStyleDate|15 February|1908|2 February}} in [[Ivanovo, Tula Oblast|Ivanovo]], [[Kimovsky District]], then part of [[Tula Governorate]], in the [[Russian Empire]].<ref name=\"KM\"/> His father was a railway worker, and after graduating from school Nikolai Kulakov entered the [[Kiev]] school which trained workers for a locomotive repair plant.<ref name=\"RP\"/> The plant's [[Komsomol]] sponsored ships of the [[Black Sea Fleet]], and through this Kulakov became acquainted with the navy.

Serving on the Black Sea during the start of the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of the Soviet Union]] in 1941, Kulakov took part in planning the defences of the Black Sea ports, and when they were overwhelmed, the counterattacks. The heavy human cost of these brought the Military Council under investigation and Kulakov suffered his first demotion, from rear-admiral to [[captain 1st rank]], and reassignment.\n\nReturned to useful work and restored to his former rank by the Navy's commander in chief, [[Nikolay Kuznetsov (officer)|Nikolay Kuznetsov]], Kulakov repaid Kuznetsov by acting as his prosecutor in a trial on charges of giving away military secrets, and succeeded in having Kuznetsov demoted. Kulakov himself was demoted shortly afterwards for \"unsatisfactory leadership of party political work\", but once more returned to prominence and former rank with service with the Black Sea Fleet. Implicated in the loss of the battleship [[Soviet battleship Novorossiisk|''Novorossiisk'']] in 1955, Kulakov was demoted for a third time and transferred to the [[Baltic Fleet]].

Induction into the Racing Hall of Fame in both Canada and the United States followed in 1976.

As a sire of sires, his impact on the breed is still felt worldwide.\n\nAt age two, Northern Dancer was named the [[Canadian Champion Two-Year-Old Colt]] after winning both the [[Summer Stakes (Canada)|Summer Stakes]] and [[Coronation Futurity]] in Canada, plus the [[Remsen Stakes]] in New York. At three, he became a leading contender for the Kentucky Derby with wins in the [[Flamingo Stakes]], [[Florida Derby]], and [[Blue Grass Stakes]]. Northern Dancer followed up his win in the Kentucky Derby by winning the [[Preakness Stakes]]. With a chance at the [[Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing (United States)|American Triple Crown]], he finished third in the [[Belmont Stakes]]. Returning to Canada for a hero's welcome, he then won the [[Queen's Plate]] in what proved to be his last race.\n\nNorthern Dancer retired to stud in 1965 at [[Windfields Farm]] in Canada. He was an immediate success when his first crop reached racing age in 1968, and the success of his second crop, led by [[English Triple Crown]] winner [[Nijinsky (horse)|Nijinsky]], brought his name to the international stage. Northern Dancer was relocated to the Maryland branch of Windfields Farm, where he became the most sought sire of his time.\n\n==Background==\nNorthern Dancer was a [[Bay (horse)|bay]] [[stallion]] with a crooked white [[Horse markings#Facial markings|blaze]] and three white [[Horse markings#Leg markings|socks]].<ref name=\"KingOfCanada\">{{cite web |title=The King of Canada: Northern Dancer |url=https://horsenetwork.com/2017/06/king-canada-northern-dancer/ |website=Horse Network |accessdate=13 January 2020 |date=28 June 2017}}</ref> He was bred in [[Ontario]] by Canadian business magnate [[E.

Paul Bohenko was his jockey since Turcotte was committed to another horse, Ramblin' Man. Northern Dancer entered into a speed duel at the start of the race, setting up the race for Ramblin' Man to come from behind and win.<ref name=Hunter86 /> After the race, Turcotte is quoted as having told Luro, \"the Dancer was definitely the best two year old in Canada, maybe in the world.\"<ref name=Timeline /> \n\nHe next entered the [[Summer Stakes (Canada)|Summer Stakes]] on August 24, then at a distance of 1 mile on the turf at [[Fort Erie]]. The track condition was described as 'bog-like', and the horse is said to have almost fallen. Despite struggling with the ground, Northern Dancer led from the start and hung on for the win.<ref name=Timeline />\n\nAfter a brief layoff, Northern Dancer was entered in the {{frac|1|1|16}} mile [[Cup and Saucer Stakes]] on September 28 over the [[Woodbine Racetrack|Woodbine]] turf course, where he was assigned the top weight of 124 pounds. Ron Turcotte was back as his jockey and took him to an early lead, but Northern Dancer tired and fell second to long-shot Grand Garcon by three-quarters of a length.<ref name=Timeline /> Turcotte believed the horse had still not recovered from the effort in the Summer Stakes and was favouring his left fore. \"He kept wanting to bear left, and I couldn't get him on his right lead at all.\"<ref name=\"Hunter, pg. 90\">Hunter, pg. 90</ref>\n\nOn October 7, he returned in the Bloordale Purse at 1 mile and 70 yards where he was again the top weight at 122 pounds. His main rival Northern Flight carried 117 pounds while other horses carried as little as 112 pounds. Northern Dancer broke well but allowed Northern Flight to take a commanding lead. At the halfway mark, Northern Dancer was third on the rail, 15 lengths back, but gradually closed the gap on the far turn. Down the stretch, the two battled for the lead before Northern Dancer pulled away to win by {{frac|1|1|2}} lengths, with the rest of the field some twenty-five plus lengths behind Northern Flight.<ref name=Timeline />\n\nOn October 12, Northern Dancer faced a field of 14 rivals in the [[Coronation Futurity Stakes]], the richest race for Canadian two-year-olds. He settled in fourth at the start, then took over the lead at the halfway point, drawing away to win by {{frac|6|1|4}} lengths. It was Turcotte's last ride on Northern Dancer, as Luro feared he could not maintain sufficient control of the headstrong colt. \"God knows how good [Northern Dancer] really was,\" recalled Turcotte, \"for he was never a completely sound horse most of the time I rode him, and I still could not slow him down more than that.\"<ref>Lennox, pp. 70-71</ref>\n\nOn November 6, Northern Dancer followed up with a win in the seven furlong Carleton Stakes at [[Greenwood Raceway|Greenwood]] on a muddy track. He won by {{frac|2|1|2}} lengths, but the ''[[Daily Racing Form]]'' called him an \"unwilling winner\", reflecting heavy pressure from new jockey Jimmy Fitzsimmons, who used the whip throughout the stretch drive. Northern Dancer came back to the barn bleeding from the beginning of a [[quarter crack]]. It was thought that the injury was a result of his heavy race schedule \u2013 seven races in three months.<ref name=\"Timeline\" />\n\nNonetheless, the colt was shipped to [[Aqueduct Racetrack]] in New York to compete against American horses. On November 18, he was entered in the Sir Gaylord Purse. He was ridden by [[Manuel Ycaza]], and won by eight lengths over Bupers, who had won the [[Belmont Futurity]]. However, the quarter crack became more pronounced, so he was fitted with a [[bar shoe]] on his left front [[horse hoof|hoof]] to stabilize the foot.<ref name=Timeline />\n\nOn November 27, Northern Dancer was the odds-on favourite in a field of six horses entered in the [[Remsen Stakes]], despite carrying top weight of 124 pounds. Ycaza sent him to the lead early and he won by two lengths in [[Glossary of North American horse racing#W|wire-to-wire]] fashion.

Northern Dancer was bumped at the start and fell to the back of the pack. He recovered and steadily advanced up the rail, only to become trapped behind several horses. He was bumped again and eventually finished third behind Chieftain. Despite the instructions of Luro, Ussury had taken to his whip in the final strides of the race, which led the trainer to publicly criticize the rider.<ref name=Timeline /> \"I believe in being very patient with my horses,\" said Luro. \"I don't want punishment \u2013 under no circumstances.\"<ref name=\"SILuro\">{{cite web|last1=Wright|first1=Alfred|title=The Continental Touch of Horation Luro|url=https://www.si.com/vault/1964/05/04/606807/the-continental-touch-of-senor-horatio-luro|website=si.com|accessdate=6 July 2016}}</ref>\n\nOn February 24, Northern Dancer and Chieftain again faced each other in a public workout over seven furlongs at Hialeah. Northern Dancer broke slowly but soon took the lead and won by seven lengths in a time of 1:23{{frac|2|5}}. He continued to gallop out past the wire, completing one mile in 1:36{{frac|2|5}} and nine furlongs in 1:50{{frac|4|5}}.<ref>{{cite web |title=Northern Dancer Beats Chieftain, Trader in Hialeah Test; FLAMINGO CHOICE 7\u2010LENGTH VICTOR; Canadian Colt's Stock Rises After Impressive Triumph in 7\u2010Furlong Workout |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1964/02/25/archives/northern-dancer-beats-chieftain-trader-in-hialeah-test-flamingo.html |website=The New York Times |accessdate=8 December 2019 |date=25 February 1964}}</ref>\n\nFor his next start in the [[Flamingo Stakes]] on March 3, Northern Dancer was ridden by Hall of Fame jockey [[Bill Shoemaker]] and went off as the even-money favourite in a field of eleven. He settled into second and moved to the lead in the stretch after some gentle urging by Shoemaker, winning by two lengths over Mr. Brick, with Quadrangle a further eight lengths back in third. His time of 1:47{{frac|4|5}} was the second fastest in the history of the race, behind only [[Bold Ruler]]'s time of 1:47 flat. Shoemaker was pleased with the performance. \"My little horse got a little leg weary in the last sixteenth of a mile,\" he said, \"but that was natural.

With Shoemaker back up, Northern Dancer raced in mid-pack behind a slow pace, then started to make up ground on the rail. Shoemaker waited until the half mile pole then urged the colt on without using the whip. Norther Dancer quickly took the lead at the head of the stretch and then held off a challenge by The Scoundrel, eventually winning by a length.

Joe Hirsch of the ''Daily Racing Form'' commented, \"It did not appear that Shoemaker had a lot of horse left at the wire.\"<ref name=\"Timeline\" /> Luro was satisfied with the performance though, feeling that the slow time of the race was the result of a fast workout a few days earlier in which Northern Dancer had fought restraint by the exercise rider.<ref name=\"FlaDerby\">{{cite web |title=Northern Dancer Wins Big Gulfstream Race\u2014Shoemaker Aboard |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1964/04/05/archives/the-scoundrel-2d-northern-dancer-wins-big-gulfstream-raceshoemaker.html |website=The New York Times |accessdate=8 December 2019 |date=5 April 1964}}</ref>\n\nShortly after the race, Luro asked Shoemaker to commit to riding Northern Dancer in the [[Kentucky Derby]]. But Shoemaker instead chose [[Hill Rise]], who had won the [[San Felipe Stakes]] and the [[Santa Anita Derby]] in California. Shoemaker had never ridden Hill Rise but campaigned hard to get the mount, believing the colt represented his best chance for a Derby win. Ycaza was also unable to commit to Northern Dancer as another trainer had first call on his services. Ultimately, Luro settled on [[Bill Hartack]], who had ridden Luro's previous Kentucky Derby winner, [[Decidedly]].<ref>Hunter, pp. 101-103</ref> \"I'm not upset about it at all,\" said Luro. \"I guess Shoemaker must not have been impressed with my horse's race Saturday, but I believe it was far from his best effort.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=Kentucky Derby Jockeys in a Shift; Shoemaker Switches From Northern Dancer to Hill Rise for Kentucky Derby; HARTACK TO RIDE BIG STAKES VICTOR |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1964/04/07/archives/kentucky-derby-jockeys-in-a-shift-shoemaker-switches-from-northern.html |website=The New York Times |accessdate=8 December 2019 |date=7 April 1964}}</ref>\n\nWith his new jockey, Northern Dancer was made the 1\u20135 favourite in a field of five in the [[Blue Grass Stakes]] at [[Keeneland]] on April 23. With Northern Dancer so heavily backed, only win betting was allowed. Northern Dancer rated in second behind a slow early pace until the head of the stretch when he coasted to the lead. Another horse, Allen Adair, made a run down the stretch so Hartack released his grip and Northern Dancer crossed the finish line in front by half a length. He completed the nine furlongs in a time of 1:49{{frac|4|5}} and galloped out the Derby distance of ten furlongs in 2:03.

As the field reached the track, he \"bounced like a rubber ball\" and gave a huge buck when the band started to play \"[[My Old Kentucky Home]]\". He settled during the warm up, only to balk when asked to enter the starting gate. After a few tense moments, Northern Dancer relaxed and loaded quietly.<ref name=Timeline /><ref>Hunter, pp. 108-109</ref> After the break, he settled into good position on the rail around the first turn behind the early pacemakers Mr. Brick and Royal. Down the backstretch, Hartack guided him through a narrow hole into the clear and started to make up ground on the leaders. He got the jump on Hill Rise, who became tangled up in traffic as the front-runners started to fade. With a quarter mile to go, Hartack urged his colt on; Northern Dancer responded by running the next furlong in a very fast 11 seconds. He had a lead of about two lengths, but Hill Rise had gotten in the clear and started to make up ground.<ref name=SIKentucky>{{cite web|last1=Tower|first1=Whitney|title=The Dancer Dazzles Old Kentucky|url=https://www.si.com/vault/1964/05/11/607195/the-dancer-dazzles-old-kentucky|website=si.com|accessdate=5 July 2016}}</ref> Author [[Kevin Chong]] later wrote of Northern Dancer's \"short, powerful legs making like a hummingbird's wings\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Izenberg|first1=Dafna|title=Northern Dancer: a legendary Canadian horse|url=http://www.macleans.ca/culture/books/living-on-the-coast-waiting-for-the-big-one/|website=macleans.ca|accessdate=3 July 2016|date=17 April 2014}}</ref> as he ran down the stretch.

Accordingly, he used long gallops of between two and three miles to build up stamina. Then on the Friday before the race, he \"blew out\" Northern Dancer with a 3-furlong workout in a brisk :35{{frac|3|5}} to sharpen his speed.<ref name=\"SIPreakness\">{{cite web|last1=Tower|first1=Whitney|title=Three for the Triple Crown|url=https://www.si.com/vault/1964/05/25/625173/three-for-the-triple-crown|website=si.com|accessdate=5 July 2016}}</ref>\n\nFor the Preakness on May 16, Northern Dancer went off as the 2-1 second favourite to Hill Rise in a field of six that included the top five finishers from the Derby plus [[Quadrangle (horse)|Quadrangle]]. Northern Dancer settled into third place with Hill Rise tracking just behind. Quadrangle moved to the lead down the backstretch and Northern Dancer started to make his move around the far turn. Hartack had yet to ask Northern Dancer for his run, while the jockeys of both Hill Rise and Quadrangle were working hard to maintain their position. Turning into the stretch, Hartack hit Northern Dancer once and he surged to a commanding lead. Near the finish line, Northern Dancer started to tire but Hartack was not overly worried. \"If he was tired, the horses behind us would be even more tired,\" he explained. Northern Dancer won by two and a half lengths. Hill Rise finished third, caught at the wire by The Scoundrel who claimed second.<ref name=SIPreakness />\n\nNorthern Dancer celebrated his actual third birthday on May 27 and was presented with a cake of carrots adorned by Canadian flags. He also received hundreds of cards wishing him success in the upcoming Belmont Stakes. Taylor felt that the horse would not mind the distance of 12 furlongs, believing that Hartack would be able to judge the pace and conserve energy. Luro was more worried, believing that Northern Dancer's best distance was between eight and nine furlongs, but hoped the horse's class would be enough to carry him the extra distance.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Tower|first1=Whitney|title=One More to Make It Nine|url=https://www.si.com/vault/1964/06/08/606850/one-more-to-make-it-nine|website=si.com|accessdate=5 July 2016}}</ref>\n\nWith a Triple Crown at stake, a then-record crowd of 61,215 showed up for the [[Belmont Stakes]] on June 6, run that year at Aqueduct due to renovations at Belmont Park. Northern Dancer went off as the 4\u20135 favourite in a field of eight, with Hill Rise the second choice at 2-1 and Quadrangle at 13-2. With Northern Dancer under a tight hold, he and Hill Rise tracked each other for the first mile behind a slow pace set by outsider Orientalist. Quadrangle was in second, relaxed and saving ground with excellent position on the rail. After a mile in 1:39{{frac|1|5}}, Quadrangle's jockey made his move, confident his horse had enough stamina to outlast the others. Hartack on Northern Dancer and Shoemaker on Hill Rise appeared to underestimate Quadrangle and did not at first respond, allowing Quadrangle to build a substantial lead into the stretch. When finally asked to run, Northern Dancer closed the gap to within half a length in midstretch. However, he then tired and was passed by Roman Brother to finish third, some six lengths behind the winner. Shoemaker on Hill Rise, who finished fourth, lodged an objection against Hartack for being squeezed off on the final turn but the stewards disallowed the claim. The time of 2:28{{frac|2|5}} was just two-fifths of a second off the track record.<ref name=NYT-Belmont /><ref name=\"SIBelmont\">{{cite web|last1=Tower|first1=Whitney|title=SI Vault \u2013 Taken for a Virginia Reel|url=https://www.si.com/vault/issue/42846/44/2|website=www.si.com|accessdate=5 July 2016}}</ref>\n\nHartack said he had been worried about several horses, including Quadrangle, before the race and felt the distance was the decisive factor.

The first crop reached racing age in 1968 and was an immediate success, including [[Viceregal (horse)|Viceregal]], who was named Canadian Horse of the Year. Nine others also became [[Stakes race|stakes winners]], an \"astounding\" 47.6% of the crop.<ref>Hunter, pp. 127-129</ref> \"His first foals ran so well,\" said Ed Bowen, former editor of ''The Blood-Horse''. \"Northern Dancer had that aura about him right away.\" <ref name=Kocher />\n\nAlthough his second crop produced only four stakes winners, it played a crucial role in his developing reputation. His leading performer was Nijinsky, who was purchased by Irish trainer [[Vincent O'Brien]] at the Canadian yearling sale for $84,000. Nijinsky went on to win the 1970 [[English Triple Crown]], the first horse to do so since 1935. Nijinsky was named Horse of the Year in England and Ireland. Meanwhile, [[Fanfreluche]] was named Canadian Horse of the Year and co-champion three year-old-filly in both Canada and the United States.<ref>Hunter, pp. 130-134</ref>\n\nAs the result of his success, Northern Dancer was relocated to the Maryland division of Windfields Farms and was syndicated in August 1970 for $2.4 million. Taylor retained several shares in the stallion, while other members included [[Claiborne Farm]], [[Allaire du Pont]], [[Greentree Stable|Greentree Stud]], [[J. Louis Levesque]], [[Paul Mellon]], [[Spendthrift Farm]], [[Tartan Stable|Tartan Farm]] and [[Alfred G.

As a result of the scarcity of his services and his continued success, Northern Dancer's stud fee rose, slowly at first: from $10,000 (live foal) in 1965, to $15,000 (live foal) in 1969, to $25,000 (live foal) in 1971 to $35,000 ($10,000 of which was non-refundable) in 1975 to $50,000 (no guarantee) in 1978.

He then became one of the most successful [[Stallion|sires]] of the 20th century. He is considered a Canadian icon, and was inducted into the [[Canadian Sports Hall of Fame]] in 1965. Induction into the Racing Hall of Fame in both Canada and the United States followed in 1976. As a competitor, ''[[The Blood-Horse]]'' ranked him as one of the [[Blood-Horse magazine List of the Top 100 U.S. Racehorses of the 20th Century|top 100 U.S. Thoroughbred racehorses of the 20th century]]. As a sire of sires, his impact on the breed is still felt worldwide.\n\nAt age two, Northern Dancer was named the [[Canadian Champion Two-Year-Old Colt]] after winning both the [[Summer Stakes (Canada)|Summer Stakes]] and [[Coronation Futurity]] in Canada, plus the [[Remsen Stakes]] in New York. At three, he became a leading contender for the Kentucky Derby with wins in the [[Flamingo Stakes]], [[Florida Derby]], and [[Blue Grass Stakes]]. Northern Dancer followed up his win in the Kentucky Derby by winning the [[Preakness Stakes]]. With a chance at the [[Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing (United States)|American Triple Crown]], he finished third in the [[Belmont Stakes]]. Returning to Canada for a hero's welcome, he then won the [[Queen's Plate]] in what proved to be his last race.\n\nNorthern Dancer retired to stud in 1965 at [[Windfields Farm]] in Canada. He was an immediate success when his first crop reached racing age in 1968, and the success of his second crop, led by [[English Triple Crown]] winner [[Nijinsky (horse)|Nijinsky]], brought his name to the international stage. Northern Dancer was relocated to the Maryland branch of Windfields Farm, where he became the most sought sire of his time.\n\n==Background==\nNorthern Dancer was a [[Bay (horse)|bay]] [[stallion]] with a crooked white [[Horse markings#Facial markings|blaze]] and three white [[Horse markings#Leg markings|socks]].<ref name=\"KingOfCanada\">{{cite web |title=The King of Canada: Northern Dancer |url=https://horsenetwork.com/2017/06/king-canada-northern-dancer/ |website=Horse Network |accessdate=13 January 2020 |date=28 June 2017}}</ref> He was bred in [[Ontario]] by Canadian business magnate [[E. P. Taylor|Edward P. Taylor]], owner of Windfields Farm. He was from the first crop of [[Nearctic (horse)|Nearctic]] and was the first foal out of the mare [[Natalma]], whose sire was [[Native Dancer]].<ref name=\"Nearctic\"/><ref name=\"Almahmoud\" /> \n\nAll Thoroughbreds in the Northern Hemisphere have an official birth date of January 1 but Northern Dancer was foaled late in the season on May 27, 1961. He was only {{hands|14}} high{{efn|The average height for a Thoroughbred, measured at the [[withers]], is about 16 hands (64 inches)}}<ref>{{cite web |title=Pedigree Analysis: Is Bigger Always Better? |url=https://www.bloodhorse.com/horse-racing/articles/108817/pedigree-analysis-is-bigger-always-better |website=BloodHorse.com |accessdate=5 April 2020 |language=en}}</ref> when Windfields Farm offered all of its [[Yearling (horse)|yearlings]] for sale at its annual auction. Despite a strong pedigree and good [[Horse conformation|conformation]], Northern Dancer did not find a buyer at his [[C$]]25,000 reserve price. As a result, Northern Dancer stayed in the Windfields Farm racing stable.<ref name=KingOfCanada /><ref name=\"CHoF\" />\n\nAt maturity, Northern Dancer had powerful quarters along with excellent balance and agility. His stallion listings showed his height as {{hands|15.2}}, but most horsemen who had met him estimated his height as between 15 and 15.1 hands.<ref name=ACP /> Shortly before the Kentucky Derby at age three, he weigh {{convert|940|lb|kg}}.<ref name=NYT-KDerby /> Like Nearctic and Nearco before him, Northern Dancer had a dominant and sometimes unruly temperament. \"He wasn't mean, but he would wheel and do some tricks,\" said Joe Thomas, who later managed the horse's stud career. Trainer [[Horatio Luro]] originally wanted to [[gelding|geld]] the colt, but Taylor refused.<ref name=\"Kocher\" />\n\nSportswriter Jim Murray of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' wrote: \"Northern Dancer is the kind of colt who, if you saw him in your living room, you'd send for a trap and put cheese in it. He's so little, a cat would chase him. But he's so plucky there's barely room in him for his heart. His legs are barely long enough to keep his tail off the ground. He probably takes a hundred more strides than anyone else, but he's harder to pass than a third martini.\"<ref name=Kocher />\n\n==Racing career==\n\n===1963: Two-year-old season===\nOn August 2, 1963, Northern Dancer made his debut at [[Fort Erie Race Track]] in a [[maiden race]] for Canadian foaled two-year-olds over a distance of {{frac|5|1|2}} [[furlongs]]. He was ridden by apprentice jockey [[Ron Turcotte]], who was instructed not to use the whip but gave the colt a tap at the sixteenth pole anyway, whereupon Northern Dancer \"exploded\".<ref name=\"Timeline\">{{cite web|title=Northern Dancer a Very Unlikely Hero {{!}} Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame (archived version)|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181119152234/http://www.canadianhorseracinghalloffame.com:80/northern-dancer-timeline/|website=horseracinghalloffame.com|accessdate=4 December 2019}}</ref><ref name=Hunter86 /> He beat seven horses for a purse of $2,100.<ref>{{cite web|title=Fort Erie Race Track \u2013 Our History|url=http://www.forterieracing.com/about-us1/our-history/|website=www.forterieracing.com|accessdate=5 July 2016}}</ref> Turcotte later recalled, \"We won that race by eight [[Horse length|lengths]].

Paul Bohenko was his jockey since Turcotte was committed to another horse, Ramblin' Man. Northern Dancer entered into a speed duel at the start of the race, setting up the race for Ramblin' Man to come from behind and win.<ref name=Hunter86 /> After the race, Turcotte is quoted as having told Luro, \"the Dancer was definitely the best two year old in Canada, maybe in the world.\"<ref name=Timeline /> \n\nHe next entered the [[Summer Stakes (Canada)|Summer Stakes]] on August 24, then at a distance of 1 mile on the turf at [[Fort Erie]]. The track condition was described as 'bog-like', and the horse is said to have almost fallen. Despite struggling with the ground, Northern Dancer led from the start and hung on for the win.<ref name=Timeline />\n\nAfter a brief layoff, Northern Dancer was entered in the {{frac|1|1|16}} mile [[Cup and Saucer Stakes]] on September 28 over the [[Woodbine Racetrack|Woodbine]] turf course, where he was assigned the top weight of 124 pounds. Ron Turcotte was back as his jockey and took him to an early lead, but Northern Dancer tired and fell second to long-shot Grand Garcon by three-quarters of a length.<ref name=Timeline /> Turcotte believed the horse had still not recovered from the effort in the Summer Stakes and was favouring his left fore. \"He kept wanting to bear left, and I couldn't get him on his right lead at all.\"<ref name=\"Hunter, pg. 90\">Hunter, pg. 90</ref>\n\nOn October 7, he returned in the Bloordale Purse at 1 mile and 70 yards where he was again the top weight at 122 pounds. His main rival Northern Flight carried 117 pounds while other horses carried as little as 112 pounds. Northern Dancer broke well but allowed Northern Flight to take a commanding lead. At the halfway mark, Northern Dancer was third on the rail, 15 lengths back, but gradually closed the gap on the far turn. Down the stretch, the two battled for the lead before Northern Dancer pulled away to win by {{frac|1|1|2}} lengths, with the rest of the field some twenty-five plus lengths behind Northern Flight.<ref name=Timeline />\n\nOn October 12, Northern Dancer faced a field of 14 rivals in the [[Coronation Futurity Stakes]], the richest race for Canadian two-year-olds. He settled in fourth at the start, then took over the lead at the halfway point, drawing away to win by {{frac|6|1|4}} lengths. It was Turcotte's last ride on Northern Dancer, as Luro feared he could not maintain sufficient control of the headstrong colt. \"God knows how good [Northern Dancer] really was,\" recalled Turcotte, \"for he was never a completely sound horse most of the time I rode him, and I still could not slow him down more than that.\"<ref>Lennox, pp. 70-71</ref>\n\nOn November 6, Northern Dancer followed up with a win in the seven furlong Carleton Stakes at [[Greenwood Raceway|Greenwood]] on a muddy track. He won by {{frac|2|1|2}} lengths, but the ''[[Daily Racing Form]]'' called him an \"unwilling winner\", reflecting heavy pressure from new jockey Jimmy Fitzsimmons, who used the whip throughout the stretch drive. Northern Dancer came back to the barn bleeding from the beginning of a [[quarter crack]]. It was thought that the injury was a result of his heavy race schedule \u2013 seven races in three months.<ref name=\"Timeline\" />\n\nNonetheless, the colt was shipped to [[Aqueduct Racetrack]] in New York to compete against American horses. On November 18, he was entered in the Sir Gaylord Purse. He was ridden by [[Manuel Ycaza]], and won by eight lengths over Bupers, who had won the [[Belmont Futurity]]. However, the quarter crack became more pronounced, so he was fitted with a [[bar shoe]] on his left front [[horse hoof|hoof]] to stabilize the foot.<ref name=Timeline />\n\nOn November 27, Northern Dancer was the odds-on favourite in a field of six horses entered in the [[Remsen Stakes]], despite carrying top weight of 124 pounds. Ycaza sent him to the lead early and he won by two lengths in [[Glossary of North American horse racing#W|wire-to-wire]] fashion. His time of 1:35{{frac|3|5}} for one mile was a new stakes record.<ref name=Remsen>{{cite web |last1=Nichols |first1=Joe |title=MARGIN IN REMSEN IS TWO LENGTHS; Northern Dancer, Despite a Hoof Injury, Sets Stake Record at Aqueduct A Hoof Ailment Six in Race |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1963/11/28/archives/margin-in-remsen-is-two-lengths-northern-dancer-despite-a-hoof.html |website=The New York Times |accessdate=7 December 2019 |date=28 November 1963}}</ref> Ycaza later recalled him as an \"ideal horse for any kind of situation. He would do anything you asked.\"<ref>Hunter, pg.92</ref>\n\nHis record of seven wins from nine starts earned Northern Dancer the [[Canadian Champion Two-Year-Old Colt|Canadian Juvenile Championship]]. He was rated at 126 pounds in the Canadian Free Handicap for two-year-olds, five pounds above Ramblin Road. In the American [[Experimental Free Handicap]], he was rated at 123 pounds \u2013 three pounds below champion [[Raise a Native]].<ref name=\"ACP\">{{cite web|last1=Hunter|first1=Avalyn|title=Northern Dancer|url=http://www.americanclassicpedigrees.com/northern-dancer-can.html|website=American Classic Pedigrees|accessdate=3 July 2016}}</ref>\n\n===1964: Three-year-old season===\nAfter the Remsen, Luro gave Northern Dancer some time off to heal and had a [[vulcanized rubber]] patch applied to the quarter crack. Northern Dancer recovered quickly and reentered training in January.<ref name=Timeline />\n\nHis first race at three was on February 10, 1964 in a six-furlong prep at [[Hialeah Park]] under a new jockey, [[Bobby Ussery]], who was instructed to take it easy and not use the whip. Northern Dancer was bumped at the start and fell to the back of the pack. He recovered and steadily advanced up the rail, only to become trapped behind several horses. He was bumped again and eventually finished third behind Chieftain. Despite the instructions of Luro, Ussury had taken to his whip in the final strides of the race, which led the trainer to publicly criticize the rider.<ref name=Timeline /> \"I believe in being very patient with my horses,\" said Luro. \"I don't want punishment \u2013 under no circumstances.\"<ref name=\"SILuro\">{{cite web|last1=Wright|first1=Alfred|title=The Continental Touch of Horation Luro|url=https://www.si.com/vault/1964/05/04/606807/the-continental-touch-of-senor-horatio-luro|website=si.com|accessdate=6 July 2016}}</ref>\n\nOn February 24, Northern Dancer and Chieftain again faced each other in a public workout over seven furlongs at Hialeah. Northern Dancer broke slowly but soon took the lead and won by seven lengths in a time of 1:23{{frac|2|5}}. He continued to gallop out past the wire, completing one mile in 1:36{{frac|2|5}} and nine furlongs in 1:50{{frac|4|5}}.<ref>{{cite web |title=Northern Dancer Beats Chieftain, Trader in Hialeah Test; FLAMINGO CHOICE 7\u2010LENGTH VICTOR; Canadian Colt's Stock Rises After Impressive Triumph in 7\u2010Furlong Workout |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1964/02/25/archives/northern-dancer-beats-chieftain-trader-in-hialeah-test-flamingo.html |website=The New York Times |accessdate=8 December 2019 |date=25 February 1964}}</ref>\n\nFor his next start in the [[Flamingo Stakes]] on March 3, Northern Dancer was ridden by Hall of Fame jockey [[Bill Shoemaker]] and went off as the even-money favourite in a field of eleven. He settled into second and moved to the lead in the stretch after some gentle urging by Shoemaker, winning by two lengths over Mr. Brick, with Quadrangle a further eight lengths back in third. His time of 1:47{{frac|4|5}} was the second fastest in the history of the race, behind only [[Bold Ruler]]'s time of 1:47 flat. Shoemaker was pleased with the performance. \"My little horse got a little leg weary in the last sixteenth of a mile,\" he said, \"but that was natural.

With Shoemaker back up, Northern Dancer raced in mid-pack behind a slow pace, then started to make up ground on the rail. Shoemaker waited until the half mile pole then urged the colt on without using the whip. Norther Dancer quickly took the lead at the head of the stretch and then held off a challenge by The Scoundrel, eventually winning by a length.

Joe Hirsch of the ''Daily Racing Form'' commented, \"It did not appear that Shoemaker had a lot of horse left at the wire.\"<ref name=\"Timeline\" /> Luro was satisfied with the performance though, feeling that the slow time of the race was the result of a fast workout a few days earlier in which Northern Dancer had fought restraint by the exercise rider.<ref name=\"FlaDerby\">{{cite web |title=Northern Dancer Wins Big Gulfstream Race\u2014Shoemaker Aboard |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1964/04/05/archives/the-scoundrel-2d-northern-dancer-wins-big-gulfstream-raceshoemaker.html |website=The New York Times |accessdate=8 December 2019 |date=5 April 1964}}</ref>\n\nShortly after the race, Luro asked Shoemaker to commit to riding Northern Dancer in the [[Kentucky Derby]]. But Shoemaker instead chose [[Hill Rise]], who had won the [[San Felipe Stakes]] and the [[Santa Anita Derby]] in California. Shoemaker had never ridden Hill Rise but campaigned hard to get the mount, believing the colt represented his best chance for a Derby win. Ycaza was also unable to commit to Northern Dancer as another trainer had first call on his services. Ultimately, Luro settled on [[Bill Hartack]], who had ridden Luro's previous Kentucky Derby winner, [[Decidedly]].<ref>Hunter, pp. 101-103</ref> \"I'm not upset about it at all,\" said Luro. \"I guess Shoemaker must not have been impressed with my horse's race Saturday, but I believe it was far from his best effort.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=Kentucky Derby Jockeys in a Shift; Shoemaker Switches From Northern Dancer to Hill Rise for Kentucky Derby; HARTACK TO RIDE BIG STAKES VICTOR |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1964/04/07/archives/kentucky-derby-jockeys-in-a-shift-shoemaker-switches-from-northern.html |website=The New York Times |accessdate=8 December 2019 |date=7 April 1964}}</ref>\n\nWith his new jockey, Northern Dancer was made the 1\u20135 favourite in a field of five in the [[Blue Grass Stakes]] at [[Keeneland]] on April 23. With Northern Dancer so heavily backed, only win betting was allowed. Northern Dancer rated in second behind a slow early pace until the head of the stretch when he coasted to the lead. Another horse, Allen Adair, made a run down the stretch so Hartack released his grip and Northern Dancer crossed the finish line in front by half a length. He completed the nine furlongs in a time of 1:49{{frac|4|5}} and galloped out the Derby distance of ten furlongs in 2:03.

As the field reached the track, he \"bounced like a rubber ball\" and gave a huge buck when the band started to play \"[[My Old Kentucky Home]]\". He settled during the warm up, only to balk when asked to enter the starting gate. After a few tense moments, Northern Dancer relaxed and loaded quietly.<ref name=Timeline /><ref>Hunter, pp. 108-109</ref> After the break, he settled into good position on the rail around the first turn behind the early pacemakers Mr. Brick and Royal. Down the backstretch, Hartack guided him through a narrow hole into the clear and started to make up ground on the leaders. He got the jump on Hill Rise, who became tangled up in traffic as the front-runners started to fade. With a quarter mile to go, Hartack urged his colt on; Northern Dancer responded by running the next furlong in a very fast 11 seconds.

He really did some running from the quarter pole to the eighth pole, and he was running his gamest at the wire.\"<ref name=\"NYT-KDerby\">{{cite web |title=NORTHERN DANCER WINS KENTUCKY DERBY BY A NECK |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1964/05/03/archives/northern-dancer-wins-kentucky-derby-by-a-neck-yanks-lose-to.html |website=The New York Times |first=Joe|last=Nichols|accessdate=8 December 2019 |date=3 May 1964}}</ref>\n\nWith the [[Preakness Stakes]] being run just two weeks later, Luro was concerned that Northern Dancer would find the race more demanding, especially because the track at [[Pimlico Race Course|Pimlico]] was deep and taxing. Accordingly, he used long gallops of between two and three miles to build up stamina. Then on the Friday before the race, he \"blew out\" Northern Dancer with a 3-furlong workout in a brisk :35{{frac|3|5}} to sharpen his speed.<ref name=\"SIPreakness\">{{cite web|last1=Tower|first1=Whitney|title=Three for the Triple Crown|url=https://www.si.com/vault/1964/05/25/625173/three-for-the-triple-crown|website=si.com|accessdate=5 July 2016}}</ref>\n\nFor the Preakness on May 16, Northern Dancer went off as the 2-1 second favourite to Hill Rise in a field of six that included the top five finishers from the Derby plus [[Quadrangle (horse)|Quadrangle]]. Northern Dancer settled into third place with Hill Rise tracking just behind. Quadrangle moved to the lead down the backstretch and Northern Dancer started to make his move around the far turn. Hartack had yet to ask Northern Dancer for his run, while the jockeys of both Hill Rise and Quadrangle were working hard to maintain their position. Turning into the stretch, Hartack hit Northern Dancer once and he surged to a commanding lead. Near the finish line, Northern Dancer started to tire but Hartack was not overly worried. \"If he was tired, the horses behind us would be even more tired,\" he explained. Northern Dancer won by two and a half lengths. Hill Rise finished third, caught at the wire by The Scoundrel who claimed second.<ref name=SIPreakness />\n\nNorthern Dancer celebrated his actual third birthday on May 27 and was presented with a cake of carrots adorned by Canadian flags. He also received hundreds of cards wishing him success in the upcoming Belmont Stakes. Taylor felt that the horse would not mind the distance of 12 furlongs, believing that Hartack would be able to judge the pace and conserve energy. Luro was more worried, believing that Northern Dancer's best distance was between eight and nine furlongs, but hoped the horse's class would be enough to carry him the extra distance.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Tower|first1=Whitney|title=One More to Make It Nine|url=https://www.si.com/vault/1964/06/08/606850/one-more-to-make-it-nine|website=si.com|accessdate=5 July 2016}}</ref>\n\nWith a Triple Crown at stake, a then-record crowd of 61,215 showed up for the [[Belmont Stakes]] on June 6, run that year at Aqueduct due to renovations at Belmont Park. Northern Dancer went off as the 4\u20135 favourite in a field of eight, with Hill Rise the second choice at 2-1 and Quadrangle at 13-2. With Northern Dancer under a tight hold, he and Hill Rise tracked each other for the first mile behind a slow pace set by outsider Orientalist. Quadrangle was in second, relaxed and saving ground with excellent position on the rail. After a mile in 1:39{{frac|1|5}}, Quadrangle's jockey made his move, confident his horse had enough stamina to outlast the others. Hartack on Northern Dancer and Shoemaker on Hill Rise appeared to underestimate Quadrangle and did not at first respond, allowing Quadrangle to build a substantial lead into the stretch. When finally asked to run, Northern Dancer closed the gap to within half a length in midstretch. However, he then tired and was passed by Roman Brother to finish third, some six lengths behind the winner. Shoemaker on Hill Rise, who finished fourth, lodged an objection against Hartack for being squeezed off on the final turn but the stewards disallowed the claim. The time of 2:28{{frac|2|5}} was just two-fifths of a second off the track record.<ref name=NYT-Belmont /><ref name=\"SIBelmont\">{{cite web|last1=Tower|first1=Whitney|title=SI Vault \u2013 Taken for a Virginia Reel|url=https://www.si.com/vault/issue/42846/44/2|website=www.si.com|accessdate=5 July 2016}}</ref>\n\nHartack said he had been worried about several horses, including Quadrangle, before the race and felt the distance was the decisive factor. Asked if he felt disappointed by the result, he replied, \"How can it be a disappointment when a horse runs his heart out for you? He certainly didn't disgrace himself \u2013 not to me, anyway.\"<ref name=NYT-Belmont />\n\n====Return to Canada====\nIn spite of the loss in the Belmont, the mayor of [[Toronto]] declared June 8, 1964 to be \"Northern Dancer Day\", which included a ceremony held at city hall. (The idea of a ticker-tape parade down [[Bay Street]] was nixed due to the colt's high strung temperament.)<ref name=\"KingOfCanada\" /><ref>Lennox, p. 104</ref> E. P. Taylor was presented with a key to the city\u2014carved out of a carrot.

He raced from well off the pace, trailing the field around the first turn and still in sixth down the backstretch. Hartack relaxed his hold entering the far turn, and Northern Dancer \"zoomed\" past the early leaders, then drew off to win by {{frac|7|1|2}} lengths.

Nine others also became [[Stakes race|stakes winners]], an \"astounding\" 47.6% of the crop.<ref>Hunter, pp. 127-129</ref> \"His first foals ran so well,\" said Ed Bowen, former editor of ''The Blood-Horse''. \"Northern Dancer had that aura about him right away.\" <ref name=Kocher />\n\nAlthough his second crop produced only four stakes winners, it played a crucial role in his developing reputation. His leading performer was Nijinsky, who was purchased by Irish trainer [[Vincent O'Brien]] at the Canadian yearling sale for $84,000. Nijinsky went on to win the 1970 [[English Triple Crown]], the first horse to do so since 1935. Nijinsky was named Horse of the Year in England and Ireland.
