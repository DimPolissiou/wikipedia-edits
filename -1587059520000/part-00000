One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves. It is [[Turing complete]] and can simulate a [[von Neumann universal constructor|universal constructor]] or any other [[Turing machine]].\n\n==Rules==\nThe universe of the ''Game of Life'' is an infinite, two-dimensional [[Orthogonality|orthogonal]] grid of square ''cells'', each of which is in one of two possible states, ''alive'' or ''dead'', (or ''populated'' and ''unpopulated'', respectively). Every cell interacts with its eight ''[[Moore neighborhood|neighbours]]'', which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. At each step in time, the following transitions occur:\n# Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.\n# Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.\n# Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.\n# Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.\n\nThese rules, which compare the behavior of the automaton to real life, can be condensed into the following:\n# Any live cell with two or three live neighbors survives.\n# Any dead cell with three live neighbors becomes a live cell.\n# All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.\n\nThe initial pattern constitutes the ''seed'' of the system. The first generation is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the seed; births and deaths occur simultaneously, and the discrete moment at which this happens is sometimes called a ''tick''. Each generation is a ''[[pure function]]'' of the preceding one. The rules continue to be applied repeatedly to create further generations.\n\n==Origins==\nIn late 1940, [[John von Neumann]] defined life as a creation (as a ''being'' or organism) which can reproduce itself and simulate a [[Turing machine]]. Von Neumann was thinking about an engineering solution which would use electromagnetic components floating randomly in liquid or gas.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wolfram|first=Stephen|title=A New Kind of Science|publisher=Wolfram Media, Inc.|year=2002|page=[https://archive.org/details/newkindofscience00wolf/page/1179 1179]|isbn=978-1-57955-008-0|url=https://archive.org/details/newkindofscience00wolf/page/1179}}</ref> This turned out not to be realistic with the technology available at the time. [[Stanislaw Ulam]] invented [[cellular automata]], which were intended to simulate von Neumann's theoretical electromagnetic constructions. Ulam discussed using computers to simulate his cellular automata in a two-dimensional lattice in several papers. In parallel, Von Neumann attempted to construct Ulam's cellular automaton. Although successful, he was busy with other projects and left some details unfinished. His construction was complicated because it tried to simulate his own engineering design. Over time, simpler life constructions were provided by other researchers, and published in papers and books.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nMotivated by questions in mathematical logic and in part by work on simulation games by Ulam, among others, [[John Horton Conway|John Conway]] began doing experiments in 1968 with a variety of different 2D cellular automaton rules.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wolfram|first=Stephen|title=A New Kind of Science|publisher=Wolfram Media, Inc.|year=2002|page=[https://archive.org/details/newkindofscience00wolf/page/877 877]|isbn=978-1-57955-008-0|url=https://archive.org/details/newkindofscience00wolf/page/877}}</ref> Conway's initial goal was to define an interesting and unpredictable cell automaton. Thus, he wanted some configurations to last for a long time before dying, other configurations to go on forever without allowing cycles, etc. It was a significant challenge and an open problem for years before experts on cell automatons managed to prove that, indeed, ''Conway's Game of Life'' admitted of a configuration which was alive in the sense of satisfying Von Neumann's two general requirements. While the definitions before ''Conway's Life'' were proof-oriented, Conway's construction aimed at simplicity without ''a priori'' providing proof the automaton was alive.\n\nConway chose his rules carefully, after considerable experimentation, to meet these criteria:\n# There should be no explosive growth.\n# There should exist small initial patterns with chaotic, unpredictable outcomes.\n# There should be potential for [[von Neumann universal constructor]]s.\n# The rules should be as simple as possible, whilst adhering to the above constraints.<ref>Conway, private communication to the 'Life list', 14 April 1999.</ref>\n\nThe game made its first public appearance in the October 1970 issue of ''[[Scientific American]]'', in [[Martin Gardner]]'s \"[[Mathematical Games (column)|Mathematical Games]]\" column. Theoretically, ''Conway's Life'' has the power of a [[universal Turing machine]]: anything that can be computed [[algorithm]]ically can be computed within ''Life''.<ref name=\"chapman\"> It is a model and simulation that is interesting to watch and can show that simple things can become complicated problems.{{cite web|url=http://www.igblan.free-online.co.uk/igblan/ca/|title=Life Universal Computer|author=Paul Chapman|accessdate=12 July 2009|date=11 November 2002}}</ref><ref name=\"bcg\">{{Cite book | last1=Berlekamp | first1=E.

''Life'' provides an example of [[emergence]] and [[self-organization]]. Scholars in various fields, such as [[computer science]], [[physics]], [[biology]], [[biochemistry]], [[economics]], [[mathematics]], [[philosophy]], and [[generative science]]s have made use of the way that complex patterns can emerge from the implementation of the game's simple rules.{{citation needed|reason=Example from philosophy given, but claim made across various fields, some evidence to substantiate, elucidate the implicit claim of \"diverse academic use of this game\" should be provided|date=April 2015}} The game can also serve as a didactic [[analogy]], used to convey the somewhat counter-intuitive notion that design and organization can spontaneously emerge in the absence of a designer. For example, cognitive scientist [[Daniel Dennett]] has used the analogy of ''Conway's Life'' \"universe\" extensively to illustrate the possible evolution of complex philosophical constructs, such as [[consciousness]] and [[free will]], from the relatively simple set of deterministic physical laws, which might govern our universe.<ref>{{cite book|last=Dennett|first=D.

The game could be run for hours on these machines, which would otherwise have remained unused at night. In this respect, it foreshadowed the later popularity of computer-generated [[fractal]]s. For many, ''Life'' was simply a programming challenge: a fun way to use otherwise wasted [[Central processing unit|CPU]] cycles. For some, however, ''Life'' had more philosophical connotations. It developed a cult following through the 1970s and beyond; current developments have gone so far as to create theoretic emulations of computer systems within the confines of a Life board.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rendell-attic.org/gol/tm.htm|title=A Turing Machine in Conway's Game of Life|author=Paul Rendell|date=January 12, 2005|accessdate=July 12, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.conwaylife.com/wiki/index.php?title=Spartan_universal_computer-constructor|title=Spartan universal computer-constructor|author=Adam P.

Common pattern types include: ''[[Still life (cellular automaton)|still lifes]]'', which do not change from one generation to the next; ''[[Oscillator (cellular automaton)|oscillators]]'', which return to their initial state after a finite number of generations; and ''[[spaceship (cellular automaton)|spaceships]]'', which translate themselves across the grid.\n\nThe earliest interesting patterns in the ''Game of Life'' were discovered without the use of computers. The simplest still lifes and oscillators were discovered while tracking the fates of various small starting configurations using [[graph paper]], [[blackboard]]s, and physical game boards, such as those used in [[Go (board game)|Go]]. During this early research, Conway discovered that the R-[[pentomino]] failed to stabilize in a small number of generations. In fact, it takes 1103 generations to stabilize, by which time it has a population of 116 and has generated six escaping [[Glider (Conway's Life)|gliders]];<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.conwaylife.com/wiki/index.php?title=R-pentomino|title=R-pentomino|publisher=LifeWiki|accessdate=July 12, 2009}}</ref> these were the first spaceships ever discovered.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.conwaylife.com/ref/lexicon/lex_g.htm#glider|author=Stephen A.

In the game's original appearance in \"Mathematical Games\", Conway offered a prize of fifty dollars to the first person who could prove or disprove the conjecture before the end of 1970. The prize was won in November by a team from the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], led by [[Bill Gosper]]; the \"Gosper glider gun\" produces its first glider on the 15th generation, and another glider every 30th generation from then on. For many years, this glider gun was the smallest one known.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.conwaylife.com/ref/lexicon/lex_g.htm#gosperglidergun|title=Gosper glider gun|author=Stephen A.

All three of the patterns shown below grow indefinitely. The first two create a single ''block-laying switch engine'': a configuration that leaves behind two-by-two still life blocks as its translates itself across the game's universe.<ref>\n{{cite web|url=http://www.conwaylife.com/wiki/index.php?title=Block-laying_switch_engine|title=Block-laying switch engine|publisher=LifeWiki|accessdate=July 12, 2009}}</ref> The third configuration creates two such patterns.

Silver|publisher=The Life Lexicon|accessdate=March 4, 2019}}</ref> Gosper also constructed the first pattern with an [[Asymptotically optimal algorithm|asymptotically optimal]] [[quadratic growth|quadratic growth rate]], called a ''[[Breeder (cellular automaton)|breeder]]'' or ''lobster'', which worked by leaving behind a trail of guns.\n\nIt is possible for gliders to interact with other objects in interesting ways. For example, if two gliders are shot at a block in a specific position, the block will move closer to the source of the gliders. If three gliders are shot in just the right way, the block will move farther away. This ''sliding block memory'' can be used to simulate a [[Counter (digital)|counter]]. It is possible to construct [[logic gate]]s such as ''[[logical conjunction|AND]]'', ''[[Logical disjunction|OR]]'' and ''[[Negation|NOT]]'' using gliders. It is possible to build a pattern that acts like a [[finite-state machine]] connected to two counters. This has the same computational power as a [[universal Turing machine]], so the Game of Life is theoretically as powerful as any computer with unlimited memory and no time constraints; it is [[Turing complete]].<ref name=\"chapman\"/><ref name=\"bcg\"/> In fact, several different programmable computer architectures<ref>{{cite web|url=http://conwaylife.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=2561#p37428|title=Programmable computer|publisher=conwaylife.com forums|accessdate=August 23, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://rendell-attic.org/gol/tm.htm|title=A Turing Machine in Conway's Game of Life, extendable to a Universal Turing Machine|publisher=Paul Rendell|accessdate=August 23, 2018}}</ref> have been implemented in Conway's Life, including a pattern that simulates Tetris.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/11880/build-a-working-game-of-tetris-in-conways-game-of-life/142673#142673|title=Build a working game of Tetris in Conway's Game of Life|publisher=StackExchange|accessdate=August 23, 2018}}</ref>\n\nFurthermore, a pattern can contain a collection of guns that fire gliders in such a way as to construct new objects, including copies of the original pattern. A ''universal constructor'' can be built which contains a Turing complete computer, and which can build many types of complex objects, including more copies of itself.<ref name=\"bcg\"/>\n\nOn March 6, 2018, the first truly elementary knightship, Sir Robin, was discovered by Adam P. Goucher.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.conwaylife.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=3303|title=Elementary knightship|access-date=9 March 2018}}</ref> A ''knightship'' is a spaceship that moves two squares left for every one square it moves down (like a [[Knight (chess)|knight in chess]]), as opposed to moving orthogonally or along a 45\u00b0 diagonal. This is the first new spaceship movement pattern for an elementary spaceship found in forty-eight years. \"Elementary\" means that it cannot be decomposed into smaller interacting patterns such as gliders and still lifes.<ref>[http://conwaylife.com/wiki/Elementary \"Elementary\"], LifeWiki, retrieved 2018-11-21</ref>\n\n==Undecidability==\n\nMany patterns in the Game of Life eventually become a combination of still lifes, oscillators, and spaceships; other patterns may be called chaotic. A pattern may stay chaotic for a very long time until it eventually settles to such a combination.\n\n''Life'' is [[undecidable problem|undecidable]], which means that given an initial pattern and a later pattern, no algorithm exists that can tell whether the later pattern is ever going to appear. This is a corollary of the [[halting problem]]: the problem of determining whether a given program will finish running or continue to run forever from an initial input.<ref>Elwyn R. Berlekamp, John H. Conway, and Richard K. Guy, Winning Ways for your Mathematical Plays. Academic Press, 1982</ref>\n\nIndeed, since ''Life'' includes a pattern that is equivalent to a [[universal Turing machine]] (UTM), this deciding algorithm, if it existed, could be used to solve the halting problem by taking the initial pattern as the one corresponding to a UTM plus an input, and the later pattern as the one corresponding to a halting state of the UTM. It also follows that some patterns exist that remain chaotic forever. If this were not the case, one could progress the game sequentially until a non-chaotic pattern emerged, then compute whether a later pattern was going to appear.\n\n==Self-replication==\nOn May 18, 2010, Andrew J. Wade announced a self-constructing pattern, dubbed \"Gemini\", that creates a copy of itself while destroying its parent.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://conwaylife.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=399&p=2327#p2327 |title=Universal Constructor Based Spaceship |publisher=Conwaylife.com |accessdate=2012-06-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://conwaylife.com/wiki/index.php?title=Gemini |title=Gemini \u2013 LifeWiki |publisher=Conwaylife.com |accessdate=2012-06-24}}</ref> This pattern replicates in 34 million generations, and uses an instruction tape made of gliders oscillating between two stable configurations made of Chapman\u2013Greene construction arms.

The patterns that emerge from the simple rules may be considered a form of [[mathematical beauty]]. Small isolated sub patterns with no initial symmetry tend to become symmetrical. Once this happens, the symmetry may increase in richness, but it cannot be lost unless a nearby sub pattern comes close enough to disturb it. In a very few cases the society eventually dies out, with all living cells vanishing, though this may not happen for a great many generations. Most initial patterns eventually burn out, producing either stable figures or patterns that oscillate forever between two or more states;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/conwaylife/|author=Andrzej Okrasinski|title=Game of Life Object Statistics|accessdate=July 12, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090727010353/http://geocities.com/conwaylife/ |archivedate=2009-07-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.conwaylife.com/soup/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090910010849/http://conwaylife.com/soup/ |archivedate=2009-09-10|author=Nathaniel Johnston|title=The Online Life-Like CA Soup Search|accessdate=July 12, 2009}}</ref> many also produce one or more gliders or spaceships that travel indefinitely away from the initial location. Because of the nearest-neighbour based rules, no information can travel through the grid at a greater rate than one cell per unit time, so this velocity is said to be the [[Speed of light (cellular automaton)|cellular automaton speed of light]] and denoted ''c''.\n\n==Algorithms==\nEarly patterns with unknown futures, such as the R-pentomino, led computer programmers across the world to write programs to track the evolution of Life patterns. Most of the early [[algorithm]]s were similar: they represented ''Life'' patterns as two-dimensional arrays in computer memory. Typically two arrays are used: one to hold the current generation, and one to calculate its successor. Often 0 and 1 represent dead and live cells respectively. A nested [[for loop]] considers each element of the current array in turn, counting the live neighbours of each cell to decide whether the corresponding element of the successor array should be 0 or 1. The successor array is displayed. For the next iteration, the arrays swap roles so that the successor array in the last iteration becomes the current array in the next iteration.\n\nA variety of minor enhancements to this basic scheme are possible, and there are many ways to save unnecessary computation. A cell that did not change at the last time step, and none of whose neighbours changed, is guaranteed not to change at the current time step as well. So, a program that keeps track of which areas are active can save time by not updating inactive zones.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/lifepatterns/lifeapplet.html|title=About my Conway's Game of Life Applet|author=Alan Hensel|accessdate=July 12, 2009}}</ref>\n[[File:Trefoil knot conways game of life.gif|alt=Game of Life on the surface of a trefoil knot|thumb|Game of Life on the surface of a [[trefoil knot]]]]\nTo avoid decisions and branches in the counting loop, the rules can be rearranged from an [[Egocentrism|egocentric]] approach of the inner field regarding its neighbours to a scientific observer's viewpoint: if the sum of all nine fields in a given neighbourhood is three, the inner field state for the next generation will be life; if the all-field sum is four, the inner field retains its current state; and every other sum sets the inner field to death.\n\nIf it is desired to save memory, the storage can be reduced to one array plus two line buffers. One line buffer is used to calculate the successor state for a line, then the second line buffer is used to calculate the successor state for the next line. The first buffer is then written to its line and freed to hold the successor state for the third line. If a [[torus|toroidal]] array is used, a third buffer is needed so that the original state of the first line in the array can be saved until the last line is computed.\n\n[[File:Long gun.gif|thumb|right|Glider gun within a toroidal array. The stream of gliders eventually wraps around and destroys the gun.]]\n[[File:\u0418\u0433\u0440\u0430 \"\u0416\u0438\u0437\u043d\u044c\".gif|thumb|right|Red glider on the square lattice with periodic boundary conditions]]\n\nIn principle, the ''Life'' field is infinite, but computers have finite memory. This leads to problems when the active area encroaches on the border of the array. Programmers have used several strategies to address these problems. The simplest strategy is simply to assume that every cell outside the array is dead. This is easy to program but leads to inaccurate results when the active area crosses the boundary. A more sophisticated trick is to consider the left and right edges of the field to be stitched together, and the top and bottom edges also, yielding a [[torus|toroidal]] array. The result is that active areas that move across a field edge reappear at the opposite edge. Inaccuracy can still result if the pattern grows too large, but there are no pathological edge effects. Techniques of dynamic storage allocation may also be used, creating ever-larger arrays to hold growing patterns. ''Life'' on a finite field is sometimes explicitly studied; some implementations, such as ''[[Golly (program)|Golly]]'', support a choice of the standard infinite field, a field infinite only in one dimension or a finite field, with a choice of topologies such as a cylinder, a torus or a [[M\u00f6bius strip]].\n\nAlternatively, the programmer may abandon the notion of representing the ''Life'' field with a 2-dimensional array, and use a different data structure, such as a vector of coordinate pairs representing live cells. This approach allows the pattern to move about the field unhindered, as long as the population does not exceed the size of the live-coordinate array. The drawback is that counting live neighbours becomes a hash-table lookup or search operation, slowing down simulation speed. With more sophisticated data structures this problem can also be largely solved.\n\nFor exploring large patterns at great time depths, sophisticated algorithms such as [[Hashlife]] may be useful. There is also a method, applicable to other cellular automata too, for implementation of the ''Game of Life'' using arbitrary asynchronous updates whilst still exactly emulating the behaviour of the synchronous game.<ref>{{cite conference|title=Self-Reproduction in Asynchronous Cellular Automata |first=Chrystopher L. |last=Nehaniv |date=15\u201318 July 2002 |conference=2002 NASA/DoD Conference on Evolvable Hardware |conference-url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/mostRecentIssue.jsp?punumber=8000 |publisher=IEEE Computer Society Press |location=Alexandria, Virginia, USA |pages=201\u2013209 |isbn=0-7695-1718-8 |doi=10.1109/EH.2002.1029886 |hdl=2299/6834 |hdl-access=free }}</ref> [[Source code]] examples that implement the basic ''Game of Life'' scenario in various programming languages, including [[C (programming language)|C]], [[C++]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]] and [[Python (programming language)|Python]] can be found at [[Rosetta Code]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life|title=Conway's Game of Life}}</ref>\n\n==Variations==\n{{main | Life-like cellular automaton }}\nSince ''Life''{{'}}s inception, new, similar cellular automata have been developed. The standard ''Game of Life'' is symbolized as B3/S23. A cell is born if it has exactly three neighbours, survives if it has two or three living neighbours, and dies otherwise. The first number, or list of numbers, is what is required for a dead cell to be born. The second set is the requirement for a live cell to survive to the next generation. Hence B6/S16 means \"a cell is born if there are six neighbours, and lives on if there are either one or six neighbours\". Cellular automata on a two-dimensional grid that can be described in this way are known as [[Life-like cellular automaton|{{Not a typo|''Life''-like}} cellular automata]]. Another common {{Not a typo|''Life''-like}} automaton, ''[[Highlife (cellular automaton)|Highlife]]'', is described by the rule B36/S23, because having six neighbours, in addition to the original game's B3/S23 rule, causes a birth. ''HighLife'' is best known for its frequently occurring replicators.<ref>[http://www.tip.net.au/~dbell/articles/HighLife.zip HighLife \u2013 An Interesting Variant of Life] by David Bell (.zip file)</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.conwaylife.com/ref/lexicon/lex_r.htm#replicator|title=Replicator|publisher=The Life Lexicon|author=Stephen A.

The vast majority of these 2<sup>18</sup> different rules<ref>{{cite web|url=http://conwaylife.com/wiki/Life-like#Life-like_cellular_automata |title=Life-like cellular automata - LifeWiki |publisher=Conwaylife.com |accessdate=March 4, 2019}}</ref> produce universes that are either too chaotic or too desolate to be of interest, but a large subset do display interesting behavior.

These are rules that use the same square grid as the ''Life''-like rules and the same eight-cell neighbourhood, and are likewise invariant under rotation and reflection. However, in isotropic rules, the positions of neighbour cells relative to each other may be taken into account in determining a cell's future state\u2014not just the total number of those neighbours.\n\n[[File:Oscillator.gif|right|frame|A sample of a 48-step oscillator along with a 2-step oscillator and a 4-step oscillator from a 2-D hexagonal Game of Life (rule H:B2/S34)]]\n\nSome variations on ''Life'' modify the geometry of the universe as well as the rule. The above variations can be thought of as 2-D square, because the world is two-dimensional and laid out in a square grid. One-dimensional square variations, known as [[elementary cellular automaton|elementary cellular automata]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ElementaryCellularAutomaton.html|publisher=Wolfram Mathworld|title=Elementary Cellular Automaton|accessdate=July 12, 2009}}</ref> and 3-D square variations have been developed, as have 2-D hexagonal and 2-D triangular variations. A variant using non-periodic tile grids has also been made.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn22134-first-gliders-navigate-everchanging-penrose-universe.html|magazine=New Scientist|title=First gliders navigate ever-changing Penrose universe}}</ref>\n\nConway's rules may also be generalized such that instead of two states, ''live'' and ''dead'', there are three or more. State transitions are then determined either by a weighting system or by a table specifying separate transition rules for each state; for example, ''[[Mirek's Cellebration]]''{{'}}s multi-coloured ''Rules Table'' and ''Weighted Life'' rule families each include sample rules equivalent to ''Conway's Life''.\n\nPatterns relating to fractals and fractal systems may also be observed in certain {{Not a typo|''Life''-like}} variations. For example, the automaton B1/S12 generates four very close approximations to the [[Sierpinski triangle]] when applied to a single live cell. The Sierpinski triangle can also be observed in Conway's Game of Life by examining the long-term growth of a long single-cell-thick line of live cells,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.conwaylife.com/wiki/index.php?title=One_cell_thick_pattern|title=One cell thick pattern|publisher=LifeWiki|accessdate=July 12, 2009}}</ref> as well as in ''Highlife'', [[Seeds (cellular automaton)|''Seeds'' (B2/S)]], and Wolfram's [[Rule 90]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.conwaylife.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=90|title=Life Imitates Sierpinski|publisher=ConwayLife.com forums|accessdate=July 12, 2009}}</ref>\n\n''Immigration'' is a variation that is very similar to ''Conway's Game of Life'', except that there are two ''on'' states, often expressed as two different colours. Whenever a new cell is born, it takes on the on state that is the majority in the three cells that gave it birth. This feature can be used to examine interactions between [[spaceship (cellular automaton)|spaceships]] and other objects within the game.<ref>\n{{cite web|url=http://www.conwaylife.com/ref/lexicon/lex_i.htm#immigration |title=Immigration |publisher=The Life Lexicon|author=Stephen A.

One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves. It is [[Turing complete]] and can simulate a [[von Neumann universal constructor|universal constructor]] or any other [[Turing machine]].\n\n==Rules==\nThe universe of the ''Game of Life'' is an infinite, two-dimensional [[Orthogonality|orthogonal]] grid of square ''cells'', each of which is in one of two possible states, ''alive'' or ''dead'', (or ''populated'' and ''unpopulated'', respectively). Every cell interacts with its eight ''[[Moore neighborhood|neighbours]]'', which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. At each step in time, the following transitions occur:\n# Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.\n# Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.\n# Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.\n# Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.\n\nThese rules, which compare the behavior of the automaton to real life, can be condensed into the following:\n# Any live cell with two or three live neighbors survives.\n# Any dead cell with three live neighbors becomes a live cell.\n# All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.\n\nThe initial pattern constitutes the ''seed'' of the system. The first generation is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the seed; births and deaths occur simultaneously, and the discrete moment at which this happens is sometimes called a ''tick''. Each generation is a ''[[pure function]]'' of the preceding one. The rules continue to be applied repeatedly to create further generations.\n\n==Origins==\nIn late 1940, [[John von Neumann]] defined life as a creation (as a ''being'' or organism) which can reproduce itself and simulate a [[Turing machine]]. Von Neumann was thinking about an engineering solution which would use electromagnetic components floating randomly in liquid or gas.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wolfram|first=Stephen|title=A New Kind of Science|publisher=Wolfram Media, Inc.|year=2002|page=[https://archive.org/details/newkindofscience00wolf/page/1179 1179]|isbn=978-1-57955-008-0|url=https://archive.org/details/newkindofscience00wolf/page/1179}}</ref> This turned out not to be realistic with the technology available at the time. [[Stanislaw Ulam]] invented [[cellular automata]], which were intended to simulate von Neumann's theoretical electromagnetic constructions. Ulam discussed using computers to simulate his cellular automata in a two-dimensional lattice in several papers. In parallel, Von Neumann attempted to construct Ulam's cellular automaton. Although successful, he was busy with other projects and left some details unfinished. His construction was complicated because it tried to simulate his own engineering design. Over time, simpler life constructions were provided by other researchers, and published in papers and books.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nMotivated by questions in mathematical logic and in part by work on simulation games by Ulam, among others, [[John Horton Conway|John Conway]] began doing experiments in 1968 with a variety of different 2D cellular automaton rules.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wolfram|first=Stephen|title=A New Kind of Science|publisher=Wolfram Media, Inc.|year=2002|page=[https://archive.org/details/newkindofscience00wolf/page/877 877]|isbn=978-1-57955-008-0|url=https://archive.org/details/newkindofscience00wolf/page/877}}</ref> Conway's initial goal was to define an interesting and unpredictable cell automaton. Thus, he wanted some configurations to last for a long time before dying, other configurations to go on forever without allowing cycles, etc. It was a significant challenge and an open problem for years before experts on cell automatons managed to prove that, indeed, ''Conway's Game of Life'' admitted of a configuration which was alive in the sense of satisfying Von Neumann's two general requirements. While the definitions before ''Conway's Life'' were proof-oriented, Conway's construction aimed at simplicity without ''a priori'' providing proof the automaton was alive.\n\nConway chose his rules carefully, after considerable experimentation, to meet these criteria:\n# There should be no explosive growth.\n# There should exist small initial patterns with chaotic, unpredictable outcomes.\n# There should be potential for [[von Neumann universal constructor]]s.\n# The rules should be as simple as possible, whilst adhering to the above constraints.<ref>Conway, private communication to the 'Life list', 14 April 1999.</ref>\n\nThe game made its first public appearance in the October 1970 issue of ''[[Scientific American]]'', in [[Martin Gardner]]'s \"[[Mathematical Games (column)|Mathematical Games]]\" column.

''Life'' provides an example of [[emergence]] and [[self-organization]].

The game could be run for hours on these machines, which would otherwise have remained unused at night. In this respect, it foreshadowed the later popularity of computer-generated [[fractal]]s. For many, ''Life'' was simply a programming challenge: a fun way to use otherwise wasted [[Central processing unit|CPU]] cycles. For some, however, ''Life'' had more philosophical connotations. It developed a cult following through the 1970s and beyond; current developments have gone so far as to create theoretic emulations of computer systems within the confines of a Life board.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rendell-attic.org/gol/tm.htm|title=A Turing Machine in Conway's Game of Life|author=Paul Rendell|date=January 12, 2005|accessdate=July 12, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.conwaylife.com/wiki/index.php?title=Spartan_universal_computer-constructor|title=Spartan universal computer-constructor|author=Adam P.

Common pattern types include: ''[[Still life (cellular automaton)|still lifes]]'', which do not change from one generation to the next; ''[[Oscillator (cellular automaton)|oscillators]]'', which return to their initial state after a finite number of generations; and ''[[spaceship (cellular automaton)|spaceships]]'', which translate themselves across the grid.\n\nThe earliest interesting patterns in the ''Game of Life'' were discovered without the use of computers. The simplest still lifes and oscillators were discovered while tracking the fates of various small starting configurations using [[graph paper]], [[blackboard]]s, and physical game boards, such as those used in [[Go (board game)|Go]]. During this early research, Conway discovered that the R-[[pentomino]] failed to stabilize in a small number of generations. In fact, it takes 1103 generations to stabilize, by which time it has a population of 116 and has generated six escaping [[Glider (Conway's Life)|gliders]];<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.conwaylife.com/wiki/index.php?title=R-pentomino|title=R-pentomino|publisher=LifeWiki|accessdate=July 12, 2009}}</ref> these were the first spaceships ever discovered.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.conwaylife.com/ref/lexicon/lex_g.htm#glider|author=Stephen A.

In the game's original appearance in \"Mathematical Games\", Conway offered a prize of fifty dollars to the first person who could prove or disprove the conjecture before the end of 1970. The prize was won in November by a team from the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], led by [[Bill Gosper]]; the \"Gosper glider gun\" produces its first glider on the 15th generation, and another glider every 30th generation from then on. For many years, this glider gun was the smallest one known.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.conwaylife.com/ref/lexicon/lex_g.htm#gosperglidergun|title=Gosper glider gun|author=Stephen A.

All three of the patterns shown below grow indefinitely. The first two create a single ''block-laying switch engine'': a configuration that leaves behind two-by-two still life blocks as its translates itself across the game's universe.<ref>\n{{cite web|url=http://www.conwaylife.com/wiki/index.php?title=Block-laying_switch_engine|title=Block-laying switch engine|publisher=LifeWiki|accessdate=July 12, 2009}}</ref> The third configuration creates two such patterns.

Silver|publisher=The Life Lexicon|accessdate=March 4, 2019}}</ref> Gosper also constructed the first pattern with an [[Asymptotically optimal algorithm|asymptotically optimal]] [[quadratic growth|quadratic growth rate]], called a ''[[Breeder (cellular automaton)|breeder]]'' or ''lobster'', which worked by leaving behind a trail of guns.\n\nIt is possible for gliders to interact with other objects in interesting ways. For example, if two gliders are shot at a block in a specific position, the block will move closer to the source of the gliders. If three gliders are shot in just the right way, the block will move farther away. This ''sliding block memory'' can be used to simulate a [[Counter (digital)|counter]]. It is possible to construct [[logic gate]]s such as ''[[logical conjunction|AND]]'', ''[[Logical disjunction|OR]]'' and ''[[Negation|NOT]]'' using gliders. It is possible to build a pattern that acts like a [[finite-state machine]] connected to two counters. This has the same computational power as a [[universal Turing machine]], so the Game of Life is theoretically as powerful as any computer with unlimited memory and no time constraints; it is [[Turing complete]].<ref name=\"chapman\"/><ref name=\"bcg\"/> In fact, several different programmable computer architectures<ref>{{cite web|url=http://conwaylife.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=2561#p37428|title=Programmable computer|publisher=conwaylife.com forums|accessdate=August 23, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://rendell-attic.org/gol/tm.htm|title=A Turing Machine in Conway's Game of Life, extendable to a Universal Turing Machine|publisher=Paul Rendell|accessdate=August 23, 2018}}</ref> have been implemented in Conway's Life, including a pattern that simulates Tetris.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/11880/build-a-working-game-of-tetris-in-conways-game-of-life/142673#142673|title=Build a working game of Tetris in Conway's Game of Life|publisher=StackExchange|accessdate=August 23, 2018}}</ref>\n\nFurthermore, a pattern can contain a collection of guns that fire gliders in such a way as to construct new objects, including copies of the original pattern. A ''universal constructor'' can be built which contains a Turing complete computer, and which can build many types of complex objects, including more copies of itself.<ref name=\"bcg\"/>\n\nOn March 6, 2018, the first truly elementary knightship, Sir Robin, was discovered by Adam P. Goucher.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.conwaylife.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=3303|title=Elementary knightship|access-date=9 March 2018}}</ref> A ''knightship'' is a spaceship that moves two squares left for every one square it moves down (like a [[Knight (chess)|knight in chess]]), as opposed to moving orthogonally or along a 45\u00b0 diagonal. This is the first new spaceship movement pattern for an elementary spaceship found in forty-eight years. \"Elementary\" means that it cannot be decomposed into smaller interacting patterns such as gliders and still lifes.<ref>[http://conwaylife.com/wiki/Elementary \"Elementary\"], LifeWiki, retrieved 2018-11-21</ref>\n\n==Undecidability==\n\nMany patterns in the Game of Life eventually become a combination of still lifes, oscillators, and spaceships; other patterns may be called chaotic. A pattern may stay chaotic for a very long time until it eventually settles to such a combination.\n\n''Life'' is [[undecidable problem|undecidable]], which means that given an initial pattern and a later pattern, no algorithm exists that can tell whether the later pattern is ever going to appear. This is a corollary of the [[halting problem]]: the problem of determining whether a given program will finish running or continue to run forever from an initial input.<ref>Elwyn R. Berlekamp, John H. Conway, and Richard K. Guy, Winning Ways for your Mathematical Plays. Academic Press, 1982</ref>\n\nIndeed, since ''Life'' includes a pattern that is equivalent to a [[universal Turing machine]] (UTM), this deciding algorithm, if it existed, could be used to solve the halting problem by taking the initial pattern as the one corresponding to a UTM plus an input, and the later pattern as the one corresponding to a halting state of the UTM. It also follows that some patterns exist that remain chaotic forever. If this were not the case, one could progress the game sequentially until a non-chaotic pattern emerged, then compute whether a later pattern was going to appear.\n\n==Self-replication==\nOn May 18, 2010, Andrew J. Wade announced a self-constructing pattern, dubbed \"Gemini\", that creates a copy of itself while destroying its parent.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://conwaylife.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=399&p=2327#p2327 |title=Universal Constructor Based Spaceship |publisher=Conwaylife.com |accessdate=2012-06-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://conwaylife.com/wiki/index.php?title=Gemini |title=Gemini \u2013 LifeWiki |publisher=Conwaylife.com |accessdate=2012-06-24}}</ref> This pattern replicates in 34 million generations, and uses an instruction tape made of gliders oscillating between two stable configurations made of Chapman\u2013Greene construction arms.

The patterns that emerge from the simple rules may be considered a form of [[mathematical beauty]]. Small isolated sub patterns with no initial symmetry tend to become symmetrical. Once this happens, the symmetry may increase in richness, but it cannot be lost unless a nearby sub pattern comes close enough to disturb it. In a very few cases the society eventually dies out, with all living cells vanishing, though this may not happen for a great many generations. Most initial patterns eventually burn out, producing either stable figures or patterns that oscillate forever between two or more states;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/conwaylife/|author=Andrzej Okrasinski|title=Game of Life Object Statistics|accessdate=July 12, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090727010353/http://geocities.com/conwaylife/ |archivedate=2009-07-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.conwaylife.com/soup/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090910010849/http://conwaylife.com/soup/ |archivedate=2009-09-10|author=Nathaniel Johnston|title=The Online Life-Like CA Soup Search|accessdate=July 12, 2009}}</ref> many also produce one or more gliders or spaceships that travel indefinitely away from the initial location. Because of the nearest-neighbour based rules, no information can travel through the grid at a greater rate than one cell per unit time, so this velocity is said to be the [[Speed of light (cellular automaton)|cellular automaton speed of light]] and denoted ''c''.\n\n==Algorithms==\nEarly patterns with unknown futures, such as the R-pentomino, led computer programmers across the world to write programs to track the evolution of Life patterns. Most of the early [[algorithm]]s were similar: they represented ''Life'' patterns as two-dimensional arrays in computer memory. Typically two arrays are used: one to hold the current generation, and one to calculate its successor. Often 0 and 1 represent dead and live cells respectively. A nested [[for loop]] considers each element of the current array in turn, counting the live neighbours of each cell to decide whether the corresponding element of the successor array should be 0 or 1. The successor array is displayed. For the next iteration, the arrays swap roles so that the successor array in the last iteration becomes the current array in the next iteration.\n\nA variety of minor enhancements to this basic scheme are possible, and there are many ways to save unnecessary computation. A cell that did not change at the last time step, and none of whose neighbours changed, is guaranteed not to change at the current time step as well. So, a program that keeps track of which areas are active can save time by not updating inactive zones.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/lifepatterns/lifeapplet.html|title=About my Conway's Game of Life Applet|author=Alan Hensel|accessdate=July 12, 2009}}</ref>\n[[File:Trefoil knot conways game of life.gif|alt=Game of Life on the surface of a trefoil knot|thumb|Game of Life on the surface of a [[trefoil knot]]]]\nTo avoid decisions and branches in the counting loop, the rules can be rearranged from an [[Egocentrism|egocentric]] approach of the inner field regarding its neighbours to a scientific observer's viewpoint: if the sum of all nine fields in a given neighbourhood is three, the inner field state for the next generation will be life; if the all-field sum is four, the inner field retains its current state; and every other sum sets the inner field to death.\n\nIf it is desired to save memory, the storage can be reduced to one array plus two line buffers. One line buffer is used to calculate the successor state for a line, then the second line buffer is used to calculate the successor state for the next line. The first buffer is then written to its line and freed to hold the successor state for the third line. If a [[torus|toroidal]] array is used, a third buffer is needed so that the original state of the first line in the array can be saved until the last line is computed.\n\n[[File:Long gun.gif|thumb|right|Glider gun within a toroidal array. The stream of gliders eventually wraps around and destroys the gun.]]\n[[File:\u0418\u0433\u0440\u0430 \"\u0416\u0438\u0437\u043d\u044c\".gif|thumb|right|Red glider on the square lattice with periodic boundary conditions]]\n\nIn principle, the ''Life'' field is infinite, but computers have finite memory. This leads to problems when the active area encroaches on the border of the array. Programmers have used several strategies to address these problems. The simplest strategy is simply to assume that every cell outside the array is dead. This is easy to program but leads to inaccurate results when the active area crosses the boundary. A more sophisticated trick is to consider the left and right edges of the field to be stitched together, and the top and bottom edges also, yielding a [[torus|toroidal]] array. The result is that active areas that move across a field edge reappear at the opposite edge. Inaccuracy can still result if the pattern grows too large, but there are no pathological edge effects. Techniques of dynamic storage allocation may also be used, creating ever-larger arrays to hold growing patterns. ''Life'' on a finite field is sometimes explicitly studied; some implementations, such as ''[[Golly (program)|Golly]]'', support a choice of the standard infinite field, a field infinite only in one dimension or a finite field, with a choice of topologies such as a cylinder, a torus or a [[M\u00f6bius strip]].\n\nAlternatively, the programmer may abandon the notion of representing the ''Life'' field with a 2-dimensional array, and use a different data structure, such as a vector of coordinate pairs representing live cells. This approach allows the pattern to move about the field unhindered, as long as the population does not exceed the size of the live-coordinate array. The drawback is that counting live neighbours becomes a hash-table lookup or search operation, slowing down simulation speed. With more sophisticated data structures this problem can also be largely solved.\n\nFor exploring large patterns at great time depths, sophisticated algorithms such as [[Hashlife]] may be useful. There is also a method, applicable to other cellular automata too, for implementation of the ''Game of Life'' using arbitrary asynchronous updates whilst still exactly emulating the behaviour of the synchronous game.<ref>{{cite conference|title=Self-Reproduction in Asynchronous Cellular Automata |first=Chrystopher L. |last=Nehaniv |date=15\u201318 July 2002 |conference=2002 NASA/DoD Conference on Evolvable Hardware |conference-url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/mostRecentIssue.jsp?punumber=8000 |publisher=IEEE Computer Society Press |location=Alexandria, Virginia, USA |pages=201\u2013209 |isbn=0-7695-1718-8 |doi=10.1109/EH.2002.1029886 |hdl=2299/6834 |hdl-access=free }}</ref> [[Source code]] examples that implement the basic ''Game of Life'' scenario in various programming languages, including [[C (programming language)|C]], [[C++]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]] and [[Python (programming language)|Python]] can be found at [[Rosetta Code]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life|title=Conway's Game of Life}}</ref>\n\n==Variations==\n{{main | Life-like cellular automaton }}\nSince ''Life''{{'}}s inception, new, similar cellular automata have been developed. The standard ''Game of Life'' is symbolized as B3/S23. A cell is born if it has exactly three neighbours, survives if it has two or three living neighbours, and dies otherwise. The first number, or list of numbers, is what is required for a dead cell to be born. The second set is the requirement for a live cell to survive to the next generation. Hence B6/S16 means \"a cell is born if there are six neighbours, and lives on if there are either one or six neighbours\". Cellular automata on a two-dimensional grid that can be described in this way are known as [[Life-like cellular automaton|{{Not a typo|''Life''-like}} cellular automata]]. Another common {{Not a typo|''Life''-like}} automaton, ''[[Highlife (cellular automaton)|Highlife]]'', is described by the rule B36/S23, because having six neighbours, in addition to the original game's B3/S23 rule, causes a birth. ''HighLife'' is best known for its frequently occurring replicators.<ref>[http://www.tip.net.au/~dbell/articles/HighLife.zip HighLife \u2013 An Interesting Variant of Life] by David Bell (.zip file)</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.conwaylife.com/ref/lexicon/lex_r.htm#replicator|title=Replicator|publisher=The Life Lexicon|author=Stephen A.

These are rules that use the same square grid as the ''Life''-like rules and the same eight-cell neighbourhood, and are likewise invariant under rotation and reflection. However, in isotropic rules, the positions of neighbour cells relative to each other may be taken into account in determining a cell's future state\u2014not just the total number of those neighbours.\n\n[[File:Oscillator.gif|right|frame|A sample of a 48-step oscillator along with a 2-step oscillator and a 4-step oscillator from a 2-D hexagonal Game of Life (rule H:B2/S34)]]\n\nSome variations on ''Life'' modify the geometry of the universe as well as the rule. The above variations can be thought of as 2-D square, because the world is two-dimensional and laid out in a square grid. One-dimensional square variations, known as [[elementary cellular automaton|elementary cellular automata]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ElementaryCellularAutomaton.html|publisher=Wolfram Mathworld|title=Elementary Cellular Automaton|accessdate=July 12, 2009}}</ref> and 3-D square variations have been developed, as have 2-D hexagonal and 2-D triangular variations. A variant using non-periodic tile grids has also been made.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn22134-first-gliders-navigate-everchanging-penrose-universe.html|magazine=New Scientist|title=First gliders navigate ever-changing Penrose universe}}</ref>\n\nConway's rules may also be generalized such that instead of two states, ''live'' and ''dead'', there are three or more. State transitions are then determined either by a weighting system or by a table specifying separate transition rules for each state; for example, ''[[Mirek's Cellebration]]''{{'}}s multi-coloured ''Rules Table'' and ''Weighted Life'' rule families each include sample rules equivalent to ''Conway's Life''.\n\nPatterns relating to fractals and fractal systems may also be observed in certain {{Not a typo|''Life''-like}} variations. For example, the automaton B1/S12 generates four very close approximations to the [[Sierpinski triangle]] when applied to a single live cell. The Sierpinski triangle can also be observed in Conway's Game of Life by examining the long-term growth of a long single-cell-thick line of live cells,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.conwaylife.com/wiki/index.php?title=One_cell_thick_pattern|title=One cell thick pattern|publisher=LifeWiki|accessdate=July 12, 2009}}</ref> as well as in ''Highlife'', [[Seeds (cellular automaton)|''Seeds'' (B2/S)]], and Wolfram's [[Rule 90]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.conwaylife.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=90|title=Life Imitates Sierpinski|publisher=ConwayLife.com forums|accessdate=July 12, 2009}}</ref>\n\n''Immigration'' is a variation that is very similar to ''Conway's Game of Life'', except that there are two ''on'' states, often expressed as two different colours. Whenever a new cell is born, it takes on the on state that is the majority in the three cells that gave it birth. This feature can be used to examine interactions between [[spaceship (cellular automaton)|spaceships]] and other objects within the game.<ref>\n{{cite web|url=http://www.conwaylife.com/ref/lexicon/lex_i.htm#immigration |title=Immigration |publisher=The Life Lexicon|author=Stephen A. Silver |accessdate=March 4, 2019}}</ref> Another similar variation, called ''QuadLife'', involves four different on states. When a new cell is born from three different on neighbours, it takes on the fourth value, and otherwise, like ''Immigration'', it takes the majority value.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.conwaylife.com/ref/lexicon/lex_q.htm#quadlife |title=QuadLife |publisher=The Life Lexicon|author=Stephen A.

When John Conway was first investigating how various starting configurations developed, he tracked them by hand using a [[Go (game)|Go]] board with its black and white stones. This was tedious and prone to errors. While Conway was investigating the R-pentomino, John Francis, an undergraduate student at The [[University of Cambridge]], wrote a program (for an [[IBM System/360]] mainframe at the nearby Institute of Theoretical Astronomy) to check Conway's results. This program showed that the configuration had not reached a stable state after 1000 generations.\n\nThe first interactive ''Life'' program was written in an early version of [[ALGOL 68C]] for the [[PDP-7]] by [[Michael Guy (computer scientist)|M. J. T. Guy]] and [[Stephen R. Bourne|S. R. Bourne]]. The results were published in the October 1970 issue of ''[[Scientific American]]'', along with the statement: \"Without its help, some discoveries about the game would have been difficult to make.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Mathematical Games: The fantastic combinations of John Conway's new solitaire game \"Life\"|first=Martin|last=Gardner|journal=Scientific American|volume=223|issue=4|date=October 1970|pages=120\u2013123|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican1070-120}}</ref>\n\nTwo early implementations of Life on home computers were by Malcolm Banthorpe written in [[BBC BASIC]]. The first was in the January 1984 issue of [[Acorn User]] magazine and Banthorpe followed this with a 3D version in the May 1984 issue (these can be downloaded as PDFs).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://8bs.com/aumags.htm |title=Acorn User Magazine Scans |author=<!--Not stated-->|publisher=The BBC and Master Computer Public Domain Library |access-date=2018-12-29}}</ref>\nSusan Stepney, Professor of Computer Science at the [[University of York]], followed this up in 1988 with \"Life on the line\", a program that generated one-dimensional cellular automata.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www-users.cs.york.ac.uk/susan/bib/ss/au.htm|title= AcornUser articles |last= Stepney |first= Susan |website=www-users.cs.york.ac.uk |publisher= AcornUser|access-date=2018-12-29}}</ref>\n\nThere are now thousands of ''Life'' programs online, so a full list will not be provided here. The following is a small selection of programs with some special claim to notability, such as popularity or unusual features. Most of these programs incorporate a graphical user interface for pattern editing and simulation, the capability for simulating multiple rules including Life, and a large library of interesting patterns in Life and other CA rules.\n* [[Golly (program)|Golly]] is a cross-platform (Windows, Macintosh, Linux and also iOS and Android) open-source simulation system for ''Life'' and other cellular automata (including all ''Life''-like cellular automata, the ''Generations'' family of cellular automata from ''Mirek's Cellebration'', John von Neumann's 29-state cellular automaton, and others), by Andrew Trevorrow and Tomas Rokicki. It includes the ''Hashlife'' algorithm for extremely fast generation, and [[Lua (programming language)|Lua]] or [[Python (programming language)|Python]] scriptability for both editing and simulation.\n* ''Mirek's Cellebration'' is a freeware 1-D and 2-D cellular automata viewer, explorer and editor for Windows. It includes powerful facilities for simulating and viewing a wide variety of CA rules including ''Life'', and a scriptable editor.\n* ''Xlife'' is a cellular-automaton laboratory by Jon Bennett. The standard UNIX X11 Life simulation application for a long time, it has also been ported to Windows.

It was followed by the film ''[[Superman IV: The Quest for Peace]]'', released on July 24, 1987.\n\nAlthough the film recouped its budget of $39 million, it proved less successful than the first two ''Superman'' films, both financially and critically, and received mixed to negative reviews from critics and fans. While harsh criticism focused on the film's comedic and [[Camp (style)|camp]]y tone, as well as on the casting and performance of Pryor, the special effects and Christopher Reeve's performance as Superman were praised.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the plot summary should be 400-700 words. -->\nWhile Superman is saving lives and protecting the citizens of Metropolis, Gus Gorman, a chronically unemployed ne'er-do-well, discovers he has a talent for computer programming and is hired at the [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]]-based  [[conglomerate (company)|conglomerate]] Webscoe. Gus embezzles from his employer through [[salami slicing]], bringing him to the attention of [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] Ross Webster. Webster is intrigued by Gus's potential to help him rule the world financially. Joined by sister Vera and \"psychic nutritionist\" Lorelei Ambrosia, Ross blackmails Gus into helping him.\n\nAt the ''Daily Planet'', [[Clark Kent]] convinces his boss, [[Perry White]], to let him and photographer [[Jimmy Olsen]] return to [[Smallville (comics)|Smallville]] for his high-school reunion, at the same time that his fellow reporter [[Lois Lane]] leaves for a holiday in [[Bermuda]]. En route, as Superman, Kent extinguishes a fire in a chemical plant containing unstable Beltric acid, which produces corrosive vapor when superheated. He also saves Jimmy, who breaks his leg trying to get pictures of the inferno. At the reunion, Clark is reunited with childhood friend [[Lana Lang]], a divorc\u00e9e with a young son named Ricky, and harassed by Brad Wilson, his former bully and her ex-boyfriend.\n\nInfuriated by [[Colombia]]'s refusal to do business with him, Ross orders Gus to command Vulcan, an American weather satellite, to create a [[tornado]] to destroy Colombia's coffee crop for the next several years, allowing Webster to [[corner the market]]. Gus travels to Smallville to use the offices of WheatKing, a subsidiary of Webscoe, to reprogram the satellite. Clark spends a few days in Smallville and gets closer with Lana and during a picnic, Superman saves Ricky from being killed by a [[combine harvester]]. Though Vulcan creates a devastating storm, Ross's scheme is thwarted when Superman neutralizes it, saving the harvest. Ross orders Gus to use his computer knowledge to create [[Kryptonite]], remembering an interview with Superman. Gus uses Vulcan to locate, scan, and analyze Krypton's debris. He discovers that one of the elements of Kryptonite is \"unknown\" and substitutes [[Tar (tobacco residue)|tar]] after glancing at his pack of cigarettes.\n\nLana convinces Superman to appear at Ricky's birthday party, but Smallville turns it into a town celebration. Gus and Vera, disguised as [[United States Army|Army]] officers, give Superman the flawed Kryptonite, which has no immediate effect. But Superman soon becomes selfish; his desire for Lana causes him to delay rescuing a truck driver from a jackknifed rig hanging from a bridge. Superman becomes depressed and regresses into committing petty acts of vandalism such as straightening the [[Leaning Tower of Pisa]] and blowing out the [[Olympic Flame]].\n\nGus, feeling used, gives Ross crude plans for a [[supercomputer]] and Ross agrees to build it in return for Gus creating an [[oil embargo]] by directing all oil tankers to the middle of the Atlantic Ocean until further notice. When the captain of one tanker insists on maintaining his original course, Lorelei seduces Superman, persuading him to waylay the tanker and breach the hull, causing a massive [[oil spill]]. The villains decamp to the computer's location in the [[Grand Canyon]].\n\nSuperman goes on a drinking binge, is overcome by guilt, and suffers a nervous breakdown. In a junkyard, Superman splits into two personas: the immoral, corrupted Superman and the moral, righteous [[Clark Kent]]. They engage in a battle, ending when Clark manages to destroy his evil identity. Restored to his normal self, Superman repairs the damage his evil counterpart caused.\n\nAfter defending himself from rockets and an [[LGM-118 Peacekeeper|MX missile]], Superman confronts Ross, Vera, and Lorelei. Gus's supercomputer identifies him as a threat and attempts to determine his weakness, eventually unleashing a beam of pure Kryptonite.\n\nGuilt-ridden and horrified by the prospect of \"going down in history as the man who killed Superman\", Gus destroys the Kryptonite ray with a firefighter's axe, whereupon Superman escapes. The computer becomes self-aware, defending itself against Gus's attempts to disable it. Ross and Lorelei escape the control room, but Vera is transformed into a [[cyborg]]. She attacks her brother and Lorelei with beams of energy that immobilize them. Superman returns with a canister of the Beltric acid, which he places by the supercomputer, which does not resist as it suspects no danger. The intense heat emitted by the supercomputer causes the acid to turn volatile, destroying the supercomputer. Superman flies away with Gus, leaving Ross and his cronies to the authorities. He drops Gus off at a [[West Virginia]] coal mine, where Superman recommends him to the company as a computer programmer but Gus refuses the job, deciding to take a bus to Metropolis.  \n\nSuperman returns to Metropolis. As Clark, he pays a visit to Lana, who has moved to Metropolis after Brad's numerous romantic advances. Brad shows up, having stalked Lana on her way across the country. He attacks Clark, only to end up falling onto a room service cart. Lana has also found employment at the Daily Planet as Perry White's new secretary and to the surprise of Lois Lane, who returned from her vacations with an article about corruption in Bermuda and have a newfound respect for Clark after reading his story. Before heading to lunch with Lana, Superman restores the Leaning Tower of Pisa and then flies into the sunrise for further adventures.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Christopher Reeve]] as [[Clark Kent]] / [[Superman]]: After discovering his origins in the earlier films, he sets himself to helping those on Earth. After beating arch enemy [[Lex Luthor]] twice, Superman meets a new villain: Ross Webster, who is determined to control the world's coffee and oil supplies. Superman also battles personal demons after an exposure to a synthetic form of kryptonite that corrupts him.\n* [[Richard Pryor]] as August \"Gus\" Gorman: A bumbling computer genius who works for Ross Webster and inadvertently gets mixed up in Webster's scheme to destroy Superman.\n* [[Jackie Cooper]] as [[Perry White]]: The editor of the ''Daily Planet''.\n* [[Marc McClure]] as [[Jimmy Olsen]]: A photographer for the ''Daily Planet''.\n* [[Annette O'Toole]] as [[Lana Lang]]: Clark's high school friend who reconciles with Clark after seeing him during their high school reunion. O'Toole later portrayed Martha Kent on the Superman television series ''[[Smallville]]''.\n* [[Annie Ross]] as Vera Webster: Ross' sister and partner in his corporation and villainous plans.\n* [[Pamela Stephenson]] as Lorelei Ambrosia: Ross' assistant and girlfriend. Lorelei, a voluptuous blonde bombshell, is well-read, articulate and skilled in computers, but conceals her intelligence from Ross and Vera, to whom she adopts the appearance of a superficial fool. As part of Ross' plan, she seduces Superman.\n* [[Robert Vaughn]] as Ross Webster: A villainous multimillionaire. After Superman prevents him from taking over the world's coffee supply, Ross is determined to destroy Superman before he can stop his plan to control the world's oil supply. He is an original character created for the movie.\n* [[Margot Kidder]] as [[Lois Lane]]: A reporter at the ''Daily Planet'' who has a history with both Clark Kent and Superman. She is away from Metropolis on vacation to [[Bermuda]], which put her in the middle of a front-page story.\n\nAdditionally, [[Gavan O'Herlihy]] portrays Brad Wilson, Lana's former boyfriend. Film director/puppeteer [[Frank Oz]] originally had a cameo in this film as a [[surgeon]], but the scene was ultimately deleted, though it was later included in the TV extended version of the film. [[Shane Rimmer]], who had a role in ''[[Superman II]]'' as a NASA controller, has a small part as a state police officer. Pamela Mandell, who played a diner waitress in the same film, appears here as the hapless wife of a ''Daily Planet'' sweepstakes winner.\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\nSeries producer [[Ilya Salkind]] originally wrote a [[Film treatment|treatment]] for this film that included [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac]], [[Mister Mxyzptlk]] and [[Supergirl]], but [[Warner Bros.]] did not like it.<ref>Ilya Salkind commentary, ''Superman III'' DVD, 2006 version</ref> The treatment was released online in 2007.<ref>{{cite web| title=s3_original_idea.pdf| format=PDF| date=| url= http://meatfighter.com/superman3/part4/s3_original_idea.pdf |accessdate=2012-05-05}}</ref> The Mr. Mxyzptlk portrayed in the outline varies from his good-humored comic counterpart, as he uses his abilities to cause serious harm.

Hackman would reprise his role as Lex Luthor in ''[[Superman IV]]'', with which the Salkinds had no involvement. In his commentary for the 2006 DVD release of ''Superman III'', [[Ilya Salkind]] denied any ill will between Margot Kidder and his production team and denied the claim that her part was cut for retaliation. Instead, he said, the creative team decided to pursue a different direction for a love interest for Superman, believing the Lois and Clark relationship had been played out in the first two films (but could be revisited in the future). With the choice to give a more prominent role to Lana Lang, Lois' part was reduced for story reasons. Salkind also denied the reports about Gene Hackman being upset with him, stating that Hackman was unable to return because of other film commitments.\n\nAfter an appearance by Richard Pryor on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson|The Tonight Show]]'',<ref name=\"Superman III\">{{cite web | title=The Superman Super Site - Superman III | url=http://www.supermansupersite.com/movie3.html | accessdate = 2008-01-10}}</ref> telling [[Johnny Carson]] how much he enjoyed seeing ''[[Superman II]]'', the Salkinds were eager to cast him in a prominent role in the third film, riding on Pryor's success in ''[[Silver Streak (film)|Silver Streak]]'', ''[[Stir Crazy (film)|Stir Crazy]]'' and ''[[The Toy (1982 film)|The Toy]]''.<ref name=\"fast-rewind\">{{cite web|url=http://www.fast-rewind.com/supermaniii.htm|title=Article on Superman III|work=fast-rewind.com|location=United States|accessdate=August 7, 2006}}</ref> Following the release of the film, Pryor signed a five-year contract with [[Columbia Pictures]] worth $40 million.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4517714.stm | work=BBC News | title=Comedian Richard Pryor dead at 65 | date=2005-12-10 | accessdate=2010-05-24}}</ref>\n\n===Filming===\nMost of the interior scenes were shot, like the previous ''Superman'' films, at [[Pinewood Studios]] outside London.

It was aired on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. The opening credits were in outer space, featuring the main Superman theme with slight differences. This is followed by a number of scenes, including additional dialogue but not added into any of the official [[VHS]], [[DVD]] or [[Blu-ray]] cuts of the film. The \"Deluxe Edition\" of ''Superman III'', released in 2006 on par with the DVD release of ''Superman Returns'', included these scenes in its extra features section as \"deleted scenes\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.supermanhomepage.com/tv/tv.php?topic=articles/unreleased-stuff2|title=Superman Homepage|website=www.supermanhomepage.com}}</ref>{{better source|date=April 2018}}\n\nFor many years, the TV rights to ''Superman III'' were not held by [[Warner Bros.]]; initially they were held by [[Viacom (1952\u20132006)|Viacom]], along with ''[[Superman IV: The Quest for Peace|Superman IV]]'' and the 1984 ''[[Supergirl (1984 film)|Supergirl]]'' film. Upon the merger with [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] in 1995, [[Paramount Domestic Television|Paramount TV]] inherited rights to this package, marking the first involvement of Paramount Pictures in the Superman franchise since the rights to the [[Superman (1940s animated film series)|1940s theatrical cartoons]] from [[Fleischer Studios]] and [[Famous Studios]] reverted to DC Comics in the 1950s.{{cn|date=January 2020}}\n\nThe TV package rights finally moved to Warner Bros. in 2006, but because [[The Cannon Group, Inc.|Cannon Films]] co-produced ''Superman IV'', TV rights to that movie returned to Paramount in 2009 via [[Trifecta Entertainment & Media]] as the studio owns the TV license to the Cannon library (which is mostly handled by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]] for other media).{{cn|date=January 2020}}\n\n===Merchandise===\n[[Parker Brothers]] released a board game in 1983, inspired by the film. Although the box says, \"Based on the Movie,\" the game uses comic-book art rather than art or stills from the film (to avoid royalty payments for the use on likenesses) and is barely related to the story of the film. DC Comics launched a comic book adaptation written by [[Cary Bates]] and illustrated by [[Curt Swan]]. Even [[Topps]] had a series of trading cards with stills from the movie. In 2013, [[Hong Kong]] toy based company [[Hot Toys]] launched a ''Superman III'' action figure of the evil Man of Steel with the likeness of Christopher Reeve.\n\n==Release and reception==\n''Superman III'' was shown at the [[Uptown Theater (Washington, D.C.)|Uptown Theater]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] on June 12, 1983 and then had its New York premiere on June 14, 1983 at Cinema I.<ref name=preem>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=April 13, 1983|title='Super III' Preems To Aid MoMA Preservation Fund, Special Olympics|page=4}}</ref> It was released in theatres on June 17, 1983,<ref name=AFI>{{AFI film}}</ref> in the United States and July 19, 1983, in the United Kingdom.\n\n===Box office===\n''Superman III'' grossed $60 million at the United States box office, and $20.2 million internationally, for a total of $80.2 million worldwide.<ref name=\"Superman 3 The Numbers\">{{cite web |title=Superman 3 The Numbers |url=https://www.the-numbers.com/movie/Superman-III#tab=summary |website=The Numbers |accessdate=February 11, 2020}}</ref> The film was the 12th highest-grossing film of 1983 in North America.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/yearly/chart/?yr=1983&p=.htm |title=Top Films of 1983 |publisher=Box Office Mojo |date= |accessdate=2012-04-14}}</ref>\n\n===Critical response===\nAudience and critics' and the fans reviews were generally negative and unfavorable. At [[Rotten Tomatoes]], 26% of critics have given the film positive reviews, based on 45 reviews with an average rating of 4.5/10.

Lester broke tradition by setting the opening credits for ''Superman III'' during a prolonged [[Slapstick|slapstick sequence]] rather than in outer space.\n\nThe film's screenplay, by [[David Newman (screenwriter)|David]] and [[Leslie Newman]], was also criticized.<ref name=\"Superman III\"/> When Richard Donner was hired to direct the first two films, he found the Newmans' scripts so distasteful that he hired [[Tom Mankiewicz]] for heavy rewrites. Since Donner and Mankiewicz were no longer attached, the Salkinds were free to bring their version of ''Superman'' to the screen and once again hired the Newmans for writing duties.<ref name=\"Superman II\" /> Reeve stated in his autobiography that the original script for the first ''Superman'' had so many puns and gags that it risked having Superman earn a reputation akin to that of [[Batman]] being associated with [[Batman (TV series)|the campy TV show of the 1960s]]. \"In one scene in this script, Superman would be in pursuit of Lex Luthor, identified by his bald head and grab him, only to realize he had captured [[Telly Savalas]] who would remark \"Who loves ya, baby?\" and offer Superman a lollipop. Dick [Donner] had done away with much of that inanity.\"\n\nReeve's own performance as a corrupted Man of Steel received praise, particularly the junkyard battle between this newly darkened Superman and Clark Kent.<ref name=\"rot\"/> One of the film's positive reviews was from the fiction writer [[Donald Barthelme]], who praised Reeve as \"perfect\", also describing Vaughn as \"essentially playing [[William F.

It was followed by the film ''[[Superman IV: The Quest for Peace]]'', released on July 24, 1987.\n\nAlthough the film recouped its budget of $39 million, it proved less successful than the first two ''Superman'' films, both financially and critically. While harsh criticism focused on the film's comedic and [[Camp (style)|camp]]y tone, as well as on the casting and performance of Pryor, the special effects and Christopher Reeve's performance as Superman were praised.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the plot summary should be 400-700 words. -->\nWhile Superman is saving lives and protecting the citizens of Metropolis, Gus Gorman, a chronically unemployed ne'er-do-well, discovers he has a talent for computer programming and is hired at the [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]]-based  [[conglomerate (company)|conglomerate]] Webscoe. Gus embezzles from his employer through [[salami slicing]], bringing him to the attention of [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] Ross Webster. Webster is intrigued by Gus's potential to help him rule the world financially. Joined by sister Vera and \"psychic nutritionist\" Lorelei Ambrosia, Ross blackmails Gus into helping him.\n\nAt the ''Daily Planet'', [[Clark Kent]] convinces his boss, [[Perry White]], to let him and photographer [[Jimmy Olsen]] return to [[Smallville (comics)|Smallville]] for his high-school reunion, at the same time that his fellow reporter [[Lois Lane]] leaves for a holiday in [[Bermuda]]. En route, as Superman, Kent extinguishes a fire in a chemical plant containing unstable Beltric acid, which produces corrosive vapor when superheated. He also saves Jimmy, who breaks his leg trying to get pictures of the inferno. At the reunion, Clark is reunited with childhood friend [[Lana Lang]], a divorc\u00e9e with a young son named Ricky, and harassed by Brad Wilson, his former bully and her ex-boyfriend.\n\nInfuriated by [[Colombia]]'s refusal to do business with him, Ross orders Gus to command Vulcan, an American weather satellite, to create a [[tornado]] to destroy Colombia's coffee crop for the next several years, allowing Webster to [[corner the market]]. Gus travels to Smallville to use the offices of WheatKing, a subsidiary of Webscoe, to reprogram the satellite. Clark spends a few days in Smallville and gets closer with Lana and during a picnic, Superman saves Ricky from being killed by a [[combine harvester]]. Though Vulcan creates a devastating storm, Ross's scheme is thwarted when Superman neutralizes it, saving the harvest. Ross orders Gus to use his computer knowledge to create [[Kryptonite]], remembering an interview with Superman. Gus uses Vulcan to locate, scan, and analyze Krypton's debris. He discovers that one of the elements of Kryptonite is \"unknown\" and substitutes [[Tar (tobacco residue)|tar]] after glancing at his pack of cigarettes.\n\nLana convinces Superman to appear at Ricky's birthday party, but Smallville turns it into a town celebration. Gus and Vera, disguised as [[United States Army|Army]] officers, give Superman the flawed Kryptonite, which has no immediate effect. But Superman soon becomes selfish; his desire for Lana causes him to delay rescuing a truck driver from a jackknifed rig hanging from a bridge. Superman becomes depressed and regresses into committing petty acts of vandalism such as straightening the [[Leaning Tower of Pisa]] and blowing out the [[Olympic Flame]].\n\nGus, feeling used, gives Ross crude plans for a [[supercomputer]] and Ross agrees to build it in return for Gus creating an [[oil embargo]] by directing all oil tankers to the middle of the Atlantic Ocean until further notice. When the captain of one tanker insists on maintaining his original course, Lorelei seduces Superman, persuading him to waylay the tanker and breach the hull, causing a massive [[oil spill]]. The villains decamp to the computer's location in the [[Grand Canyon]].\n\nSuperman goes on a drinking binge, is overcome by guilt, and suffers a nervous breakdown. In a junkyard, Superman splits into two personas: the immoral, corrupted Superman and the moral, righteous [[Clark Kent]]. They engage in a battle, ending when Clark manages to destroy his evil identity. Restored to his normal self, Superman repairs the damage his evil counterpart caused.\n\nAfter defending himself from rockets and an [[LGM-118 Peacekeeper|MX missile]], Superman confronts Ross, Vera, and Lorelei. Gus's supercomputer identifies him as a threat and attempts to determine his weakness, eventually unleashing a beam of pure Kryptonite.\n\nGuilt-ridden and horrified by the prospect of \"going down in history as the man who killed Superman\", Gus destroys the Kryptonite ray with a firefighter's axe, whereupon Superman escapes. The computer becomes self-aware, defending itself against Gus's attempts to disable it. Ross and Lorelei escape the control room, but Vera is transformed into a [[cyborg]]. She attacks her brother and Lorelei with beams of energy that immobilize them. Superman returns with a canister of the Beltric acid, which he places by the supercomputer, which does not resist as it suspects no danger. The intense heat emitted by the supercomputer causes the acid to turn volatile, destroying the supercomputer. Superman flies away with Gus, leaving Ross and his cronies to the authorities. He drops Gus off at a [[West Virginia]] coal mine, where Superman recommends him to the company as a computer programmer but Gus refuses the job, deciding to take a bus to Metropolis.  \n\nSuperman returns to Metropolis. As Clark, he pays a visit to Lana, who has moved to Metropolis after Brad's numerous romantic advances. Brad shows up, having stalked Lana on her way across the country. He attacks Clark, only to end up falling onto a room service cart. Lana has also found employment at the Daily Planet as Perry White's new secretary and to the surprise of Lois Lane, who returned from her vacations with an article about corruption in Bermuda and have a newfound respect for Clark after reading his story. Before heading to lunch with Lana, Superman restores the Leaning Tower of Pisa and then flies into the sunrise for further adventures.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Christopher Reeve]] as [[Clark Kent]] / [[Superman]]: After discovering his origins in the earlier films, he sets himself to helping those on Earth. After beating arch enemy [[Lex Luthor]] twice, Superman meets a new villain: Ross Webster, who is determined to control the world's coffee and oil supplies. Superman also battles personal demons after an exposure to a synthetic form of kryptonite that corrupts him.\n* [[Richard Pryor]] as August \"Gus\" Gorman: A bumbling computer genius who works for Ross Webster and inadvertently gets mixed up in Webster's scheme to destroy Superman.\n* [[Jackie Cooper]] as [[Perry White]]: The editor of the ''Daily Planet''.\n* [[Marc McClure]] as [[Jimmy Olsen]]: A photographer for the ''Daily Planet''.\n* [[Annette O'Toole]] as [[Lana Lang]]: Clark's high school friend who reconciles with Clark after seeing him during their high school reunion. O'Toole later portrayed Martha Kent on the Superman television series ''[[Smallville]]''.\n* [[Annie Ross]] as Vera Webster: Ross' sister and partner in his corporation and villainous plans.\n* [[Pamela Stephenson]] as Lorelei Ambrosia: Ross' assistant and girlfriend. Lorelei, a voluptuous blonde bombshell, is well-read, articulate and skilled in computers, but conceals her intelligence from Ross and Vera, to whom she adopts the appearance of a superficial fool. As part of Ross' plan, she seduces Superman.\n* [[Robert Vaughn]] as Ross Webster: A villainous multimillionaire. After Superman prevents him from taking over the world's coffee supply, Ross is determined to destroy Superman before he can stop his plan to control the world's oil supply. He is an original character created for the movie.\n* [[Margot Kidder]] as [[Lois Lane]]: A reporter at the ''Daily Planet'' who has a history with both Clark Kent and Superman. She is away from Metropolis on vacation to [[Bermuda]], which put her in the middle of a front-page story.\n\nAdditionally, [[Gavan O'Herlihy]] portrays Brad Wilson, Lana's former boyfriend. Film director/puppeteer [[Frank Oz]] originally had a cameo in this film as a [[surgeon]], but the scene was ultimately deleted, though it was later included in the TV extended version of the film. [[Shane Rimmer]], who had a role in ''[[Superman II]]'' as a NASA controller, has a small part as a state police officer. Pamela Mandell, who played a diner waitress in the same film, appears here as the hapless wife of a ''Daily Planet'' sweepstakes winner.\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\nSeries producer [[Ilya Salkind]] originally wrote a [[Film treatment|treatment]] for this film that included [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac]], [[Mister Mxyzptlk]] and [[Supergirl]], but [[Warner Bros.]] did not like it.<ref>Ilya Salkind commentary, ''Superman III'' DVD, 2006 version</ref> The treatment was released online in 2007.<ref>{{cite web| title=s3_original_idea.pdf| format=PDF| date=| url= http://meatfighter.com/superman3/part4/s3_original_idea.pdf |accessdate=2012-05-05}}</ref> The Mr. Mxyzptlk portrayed in the outline varies from his good-humored comic counterpart, as he uses his abilities to cause serious harm.

Brainiac is portrayed as a surrogate father to Supergirl and eventually fell in love with his \"daughter\", who did not reciprocate his feelings, as she had fallen in love with Superman.\n\n===Casting===\nBoth [[Gene Hackman]] and [[Margot Kidder]] are said to have been angry with the way the Salkinds treated ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman]]'' director Richard Donner, with Hackman retaliating by refusing to reprise the role of Lex Luthor.<ref name=\"Superman II\">{{cite web | title=The Superman Super Site - Superman II | url=http://www.supermansupersite.com/movie2.html | accessdate = 2008-01-10}}</ref> After Margot Kidder publicly criticized the Salkinds for their treatment of Donner,<ref name=\"Superman III\" /> the producers reportedly \"punished\" the actress by reducing her role in ''Superman III'' to a brief appearance.<ref name=\"Superman II\" /><ref name=\"fast-rewind\" /> Hackman later denied such claims, stating that he had been busy with other movies and general consensus that making Luthor a constant villain would be akin to incessant horror movie sequels where a serial killer keeps coming back from the grave. Hackman would reprise his role as Lex Luthor in ''[[Superman IV]]'', with which the Salkinds had no involvement. In his commentary for the 2006 DVD release of ''Superman III'', [[Ilya Salkind]] denied any ill will between Margot Kidder and his production team and denied the claim that her part was cut for retaliation. Instead, he said, the creative team decided to pursue a different direction for a love interest for Superman, believing the Lois and Clark relationship had been played out in the first two films (but could be revisited in the future). With the choice to give a more prominent role to Lana Lang, Lois' part was reduced for story reasons. Salkind also denied the reports about Gene Hackman being upset with him, stating that Hackman was unable to return because of other film commitments.\n\nAfter an appearance by Richard Pryor on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson|The Tonight Show]]'',<ref name=\"Superman III\">{{cite web | title=The Superman Super Site - Superman III | url=http://www.supermansupersite.com/movie3.html | accessdate = 2008-01-10}}</ref> telling [[Johnny Carson]] how much he enjoyed seeing ''[[Superman II]]'', the Salkinds were eager to cast him in a prominent role in the third film, riding on Pryor's success in ''[[Silver Streak (film)|Silver Streak]]'', ''[[Stir Crazy (film)|Stir Crazy]]'' and ''[[The Toy (1982 film)|The Toy]]''.<ref name=\"fast-rewind\">{{cite web|url=http://www.fast-rewind.com/supermaniii.htm|title=Article on Superman III|work=fast-rewind.com|location=United States|accessdate=August 7, 2006}}</ref> Following the release of the film, Pryor signed a five-year contract with [[Columbia Pictures]] worth $40 million.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4517714.stm | work=BBC News | title=Comedian Richard Pryor dead at 65 | date=2005-12-10 | accessdate=2010-05-24}}</ref>\n\n===Filming===\nMost of the interior scenes were shot, like the previous ''Superman'' films, at [[Pinewood Studios]] outside London.

It was aired on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. The opening credits were in outer space, featuring the main Superman theme with slight differences. This is followed by a number of scenes, including additional dialogue but not added into any of the official [[VHS]], [[DVD]] or [[Blu-ray]] cuts of the film. The \"Deluxe Edition\" of ''Superman III'', released in 2006 on par with the DVD release of ''Superman Returns'', included these scenes in its extra features section as \"deleted scenes\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.supermanhomepage.com/tv/tv.php?topic=articles/unreleased-stuff2|title=Superman Homepage|website=www.supermanhomepage.com}}</ref>{{better source|date=April 2018}}\n\nFor many years, the TV rights to ''Superman III'' were not held by [[Warner Bros.]]; initially they were held by [[Viacom (1952\u20132006)|Viacom]], along with ''[[Superman IV: The Quest for Peace|Superman IV]]'' and the 1984 ''[[Supergirl (1984 film)|Supergirl]]'' film. Upon the merger with [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] in 1995, [[Paramount Domestic Television|Paramount TV]] inherited rights to this package, marking the first involvement of Paramount Pictures in the Superman franchise since the rights to the [[Superman (1940s animated film series)|1940s theatrical cartoons]] from [[Fleischer Studios]] and [[Famous Studios]] reverted to DC Comics in the 1950s.{{cn|date=January 2020}}\n\nThe TV package rights finally moved to Warner Bros. in 2006, but because [[The Cannon Group, Inc.|Cannon Films]] co-produced ''Superman IV'', TV rights to that movie returned to Paramount in 2009 via [[Trifecta Entertainment & Media]] as the studio owns the TV license to the Cannon library (which is mostly handled by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]] for other media).{{cn|date=January 2020}}\n\n===Merchandise===\n[[Parker Brothers]] released a board game in 1983, inspired by the film. Although the box says, \"Based on the Movie,\" the game uses comic-book art rather than art or stills from the film (to avoid royalty payments for the use on likenesses) and is barely related to the story of the film. DC Comics launched a comic book adaptation written by [[Cary Bates]] and illustrated by [[Curt Swan]]. Even [[Topps]] had a series of trading cards with stills from the movie. In 2013, [[Hong Kong]] toy based company [[Hot Toys]] launched a ''Superman III'' action figure of the evil Man of Steel with the likeness of Christopher Reeve.\n\n==Release and reception==\n''Superman III'' was shown at the [[Uptown Theater (Washington, D.C.)|Uptown Theater]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] on June 12, 1983 and then had its New York premiere on June 14, 1983 at Cinema I.<ref name=preem>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=April 13, 1983|title='Super III' Preems To Aid MoMA Preservation Fund, Special Olympics|page=4}}</ref> It was released in theatres on June 17, 1983,<ref name=AFI>{{AFI film}}</ref> in the United States and July 19, 1983, in the United Kingdom.\n\n===Box office===\n''Superman III'' grossed $60 million at the United States box office, and $20.2 million internationally, for a total of $80.2 million worldwide.<ref name=\"Superman 3 The Numbers\">{{cite web |title=Superman 3 The Numbers |url=https://www.the-numbers.com/movie/Superman-III#tab=summary |website=The Numbers |accessdate=February 11, 2020}}</ref> The film was the 12th highest-grossing film of 1983 in North America.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/yearly/chart/?yr=1983&p=.htm |title=Top Films of 1983 |publisher=Box Office Mojo |date= |accessdate=2012-04-14}}</ref>\n\n===Critical response===\nAudience and critics' and the fans reviews were generally negative and unfavorable. At [[Rotten Tomatoes]], 26% of critics have given the film positive reviews, based on 45 reviews with an average rating of 4.5/10.

Lester broke tradition by setting the opening credits for ''Superman III'' during a prolonged [[Slapstick|slapstick sequence]] rather than in outer space.\n\nThe film's screenplay, by [[David Newman (screenwriter)|David]] and [[Leslie Newman]], was also criticized.<ref name=\"Superman III\"/> When Richard Donner was hired to direct the first two films, he found the Newmans' scripts so distasteful that he hired [[Tom Mankiewicz]] for heavy rewrites. Since Donner and Mankiewicz were no longer attached, the Salkinds were free to bring their version of ''Superman'' to the screen and once again hired the Newmans for writing duties.<ref name=\"Superman II\" /> Reeve stated in his autobiography that the original script for the first ''Superman'' had so many puns and gags that it risked having Superman earn a reputation akin to that of [[Batman]] being associated with [[Batman (TV series)|the campy TV show of the 1960s]]. \"In one scene in this script, Superman would be in pursuit of Lex Luthor, identified by his bald head and grab him, only to realize he had captured [[Telly Savalas]] who would remark \"Who loves ya, baby?\" and offer Superman a lollipop. Dick [Donner] had done away with much of that inanity.\"\n\nReeve's own performance as a corrupted Man of Steel received praise, particularly the junkyard battle between this newly darkened Superman and Clark Kent.<ref name=\"rot\"/> One of the film's positive reviews was from the fiction writer [[Donald Barthelme]], who praised Reeve as \"perfect\", also describing Vaughn as \"essentially playing [[William F. Buckley|William Buckley]] - all those delicious ponderings, popping of the eyes, licking of the corner of the mouth.\"<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Not-Knowing-Donald-Barthelme/dp/0609000764/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=|last=Barthelme|first=Donal |authorlink=Donald Barthelme|title=Not-Knowing: the essays and interviews|publisher=[[Penguin Random House#Divisions and imprints|Random House Value Publishing]]|location=[[New York City]]|year=1999|isbn=978-0609000762|pages=129\u2013130}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikiquote}}\n*[https://www.warnerbros.com/movies/superman-iii/ Official Warner Bros.

The player's task is to break into the neighbor's home and solve a series of puzzles in order to gather the items needed to unlock and access his basement. As the player explores the neighbor's house, they must not be spotted by the mysterious neighbor, or they will be chased down, and if the player is not quick enough to hide or escape, they will be captured. The player can stun the neighbor by throwing objects at him for an easier escape. If the player is caught (or suffers a serious injury), they will be sent back to their own house and will have to break in again. Upon starting again, the player must be more careful, as the neighbor will deduce movements from the last attempt to set up traps.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.destructoid.com/hello-neighbor-is-a-horror-game-for-cowards-415904.phtml |last=Cosimano |first=Mike |title=Hello Neighbor is a horror game for cowards |website=Destructoid |date=1 February 2017 |accessdate=28 August 2017}}</ref> However, the player can use the game settings to turn on friendly neighbor mode, preventing the neighbor from setting these traps and causing him to be less aggressive in his pursuits.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gameskinny.com/m126j/hello-neighbor-friendly-mode-changes|title=Hello Neighbor Friendly Mode Changes|last=Arthur|first=Ty|date=2017-12-11|website=www.gameskinny.com|access-date=2019-08-20}}</ref>\n\nThe game is played in a [[first-person (gaming)|first-person perspective]], and the player must aim a reticle at certain objects to interact with them or to throw or use a currently held item (for example, throwing a ball at a window or aiming a crowbar at nails to remove them).

Nicky goes to investigate and witnesses the neighbor apparently locking a person in his [[basement]].Mr Peterson (The neighbor) Sees Nicky though the window Mr Peterson Goes to the Window And jumps and catches Nicky.Then Nicky sneaks into the neighbor's house, finds the key to the basement, and enters. He finds that the neighbor has converted his basement into a makeshift underground [[dungeon]], but finds no sign of any prisoner. Nicky runs into Mr. Peterson, who is the neighbor, and is captured. Nicky wakes up, finding himself locked in the neighbor's basement dungeon. He manages to escape his cell and reach the surface, only to find that the neighbor has erected a massive fence around his property to prevent escape. Nicky is forced to solve a number of puzzles in order to find a way to escape the neighbor's property. Once he crosses the fence, he flees back to his home, though Mr. Peterson does not give chase.  \n\nThroughout both Acts 1 and 2, if Nicky is caught by Mr. Peterson before he can finish his objectives, he will have vivid nightmares about the neighbor's past. In these nightmares, it is revealed that the neighbor used to have a family consisting of a wife named Diane, a son named Aaron, and a daughter named Mya. However, the wife was killed in a car crash while Aaron killed Mya by pushing her off the roof, not knowing it would kill her, until it was too late. Mr. Peterson locks up his son in the dungeon to prevent him from getting hurt.\n\nNicky, now a grown adult, wakes up in his apartment. He is evicted from his apartment, so he decides to return to his old family home. He finds his old home in disrepair while the neighbor's home is also nothing but a pile of ruins. While inspecting the ruins, Nicky is haunted by a dark shadow-like creature and he returns to his home where he falls asleep. He is awoken by a child's scream, and he discovers the neighbor's house is back, but now larger, more complex, and more surreal than before. Nicky navigates the house and has surreal experiences, such as learning to double jump by shrinking down and trying to turn on the light that is far out of reach. Eventually, he enters the basement, now older and more surreal. When Nicky gets out of the basement, he finds himself trying to knock down a giant neighbor to get inside a house on his back. After doing so, he must protect a younger version of himself from a giant shadow man. Each time the shadow man attacks and Nicky protects the boy, Nicky grows larger until he is able to fight the shadow man. After the shadow is defeated, Nicky sees the neighbor in a small house, locking a much smaller shadow man in another room. It is implied throughout the events of the game that most of Act 3 and the Finale is a nightmare occurring in Nicky's head, and that his escape from the house signifies him finally coming to terms with his kidnapping as a boy at the hands of the neighbor.\n\n== Development ==\nThe game was released as an [[alpha build]] on Dynamic Pixels' website in 2015. It was later approved for sale as an [[early access]] game by the [[Steam Greenlight]] program and a [[Kickstarter]] campaign was launched to fund further development. The studio signed a deal with [[tinyBuild]] to publish the game.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.justadventure.com/2013-05-20-21-09-14/3738-hello-neighbor-not-exactly-welcome-wagon |title=Hello Neighbor...Not Exactly Welcome Wagon |last=Munger |first=Karla |website=www.justadventure.com |date=1 October 2017 |accessdate=28 August 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170729010004/http://www.justadventure.com/2013-05-20-21-09-14/3738-hello-neighbor-not-exactly-welcome-wagon |archive-date=29 July 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The first pre-alpha version of the game was released in September 2016.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.polygon.com/2016/9/29/13112994/hello-neighbor-trailer-home-invasion-simulator-pc-2017 |last=Frank |first=Allegra |title=Hello Neighbor is a voyeuristic indie home invasion simulator |date=29 September 2016 |website=Polygon |accessdate=28 August 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.destructoid.com/hello-neighbor-is-unexpectedly-terrifying-315677.phtml |last=Devorre |first=Jordan |title=Hello, Neighbor! is unexpectedly terrifying |website=Destructoid |date=15 October 2015 |accessdate=28 August 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://indiegames.com/2015/06/hello_neighbour_encourages_bre.html |last=Flint |first=Sean |title=IndieGames.com Hello, Neighbour!

The player's task is to break into the neighbor's home and solve a series of puzzles in order to gather the items needed to unlock and access his basement. As the player explores the neighbor's house, they must not be spotted by the mysterious neighbor, or they will be chased down, and if the player is not quick enough to hide or escape, they will be captured. The player can stun the neighbor by throwing objects at him for an easier escape. If the player is caught (or suffers a serious injury), they will be sent back to their own house and will have to break in again. Upon starting again, the player must be more careful, as the neighbor will deduce movements from the last attempt to set up traps.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.destructoid.com/hello-neighbor-is-a-horror-game-for-cowards-415904.phtml |last=Cosimano |first=Mike |title=Hello Neighbor is a horror game for cowards |website=Destructoid |date=1 February 2017 |accessdate=28 August 2017}}</ref> However, the player can use the game settings to turn on friendly neighbor mode, preventing the neighbor from setting these traps and causing him to be less aggressive in his pursuits.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gameskinny.com/m126j/hello-neighbor-friendly-mode-changes|title=Hello Neighbor Friendly Mode Changes|last=Arthur|first=Ty|date=2017-12-11|website=www.gameskinny.com|access-date=2019-08-20}}</ref>\n\nThe game is played in a [[first-person (gaming)|first-person perspective]], and the player must aim a reticle at certain objects to interact with them or to throw or use a currently held item (for example, throwing a ball at a window or aiming a crowbar at nails to remove them).

Nicky goes to investigate and witnesses the neighbor apparently locking a person in his [[basement]]. Nicky sneaks into the neighbor's house, finds the key to the basement, and enters. He finds that the neighbor has converted his basement into a makeshift underground [[dungeon]], but finds no sign of any prisoner. Nicky runs into Mr. Peterson, who is the neighbor, and is captured. Nicky wakes up, finding himself locked in the neighbor's basement dungeon. He manages to escape his cell and reach the surface, only to find that the neighbor has erected a massive fence around his property to prevent escape. Nicky is forced to solve a number of puzzles in order to find a way to escape the neighbor's property. Once he crosses the fence, he flees back to his home, though Mr. Peterson does not give chase.  \n\nThroughout both Acts 1 and 2, if Nicky is caught by Mr. Peterson before he can finish his objectives, he will have vivid nightmares about the neighbor's past. In these nightmares, it is revealed that the neighbor used to have a family consisting of a wife named Diane, a son named Aaron, and a daughter named Mya. However, the wife was killed in a car crash while Aaron killed Mya by pushing her off the roof, not knowing it would kill her, until it was too late. Mr. Peterson locks up his son in the dungeon to prevent him from getting hurt.\n\nNicky, now a grown adult, wakes up in his apartment. He is evicted from his apartment, so he decides to return to his old family home. He finds his old home in disrepair while the neighbor's home is also nothing but a pile of ruins. While inspecting the ruins, Nicky is haunted by a dark shadow-like creature and he returns to his home where he falls asleep. He is awoken by a child's scream, and he discovers the neighbor's house is back, but now larger, more complex, and more surreal than before. Nicky navigates the house and has surreal experiences, such as learning to double jump by shrinking down and trying to turn on the light that is far out of reach. Eventually, he enters the basement, now older and more surreal. When Nicky gets out of the basement, he finds himself trying to knock down a giant neighbor to get inside a house on his back. After doing so, he must protect a younger version of himself from a giant shadow man. Each time the shadow man attacks and Nicky protects the boy, Nicky grows larger until he is able to fight the shadow man. After the shadow is defeated, Nicky sees the neighbor in a small house, locking a much smaller shadow man in another room. It is implied throughout the events of the game that most of Act 3 and the Finale is a nightmare occurring in Nicky's head, and that his escape from the house signifies him finally coming to terms with his kidnapping as a boy at the hands of the neighbor.\n\n== Development ==\nThe game was released as an [[alpha build]] on Dynamic Pixels' website in 2015. It was later approved for sale as an [[early access]] game by the [[Steam Greenlight]] program and a [[Kickstarter]] campaign was launched to fund further development. The studio signed a deal with [[tinyBuild]] to publish the game.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.justadventure.com/2013-05-20-21-09-14/3738-hello-neighbor-not-exactly-welcome-wagon |title=Hello Neighbor...Not Exactly Welcome Wagon |last=Munger |first=Karla |website=www.justadventure.com |date=1 October 2017 |accessdate=28 August 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170729010004/http://www.justadventure.com/2013-05-20-21-09-14/3738-hello-neighbor-not-exactly-welcome-wagon |archive-date=29 July 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The first pre-alpha version of the game was released in September 2016.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.polygon.com/2016/9/29/13112994/hello-neighbor-trailer-home-invasion-simulator-pc-2017 |last=Frank |first=Allegra |title=Hello Neighbor is a voyeuristic indie home invasion simulator |date=29 September 2016 |website=Polygon |accessdate=28 August 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.destructoid.com/hello-neighbor-is-unexpectedly-terrifying-315677.phtml |last=Devorre |first=Jordan |title=Hello, Neighbor! is unexpectedly terrifying |website=Destructoid |date=15 October 2015 |accessdate=28 August 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://indiegames.com/2015/06/hello_neighbour_encourages_bre.html |last=Flint |first=Sean |title=IndieGames.com Hello, Neighbour!

She is the only one of Esarhaddon's daughters to be known by name and inscriptions listing the royal children suggest that she outranked several of her brothers, such as her younger brother [[Ashur-mukin-paleya]], but below the crown princes [[Ashurbanipal]] and [[Shamash-shum-ukin]]. Her importance could be explained by her possibly being the oldest of all Esarhaddon's children.\n\nAlthough she is mentioned in several royal inscriptions, she is most known for her letter dated {{Circa|}} 670 BC to Ashurbanipal's wife (her sister-in-law) [[Libbali-sharrat]] in which she reminds the future queen that Serua-eterat outranks her as she is a king's daughter and also reprimands her for not doing her homework. Serua-eterat lived into Ashurbanipal's reign and her eventual fate is unknown. A later Aramaic story has her play a central role in attempting to broker peace between Ashurbanipal and Shamash-shum-ukin on the eve of [[Ashurbanipal#Revolt of Shamash-shum-ukin|their civil war]] {{Circa|}} 652 BC and disappearing after Ashurbanipal kills his brother.\n\n== Biography ==\n[[Esarhaddon]], who reigned as king of Assyria from 681\u2013669 BC, had several daughters, but Serua-eterat is the only one known by name.
