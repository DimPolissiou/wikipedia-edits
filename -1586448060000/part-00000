Subsequently, he became a [[New Left]] and anti-Vietnam War activist.\n\nLater, Radosh turned his attention to Julius and Ethel Rosenberg. After studying declassified FBI documents and interviewing their friends and associates, Radosh concluded that [[Julius and Ethel Rosenberg]] were indeed guilty of spying for the [[KGB]]. According to one-time friend [[David Horowitz]], Radosh's decision to publish his findings led to his social ostracism; his friendship with Horowitz of 65 years ended in 2016 when Horowitz endorsed [[Donald Trump]] for president.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.frontpagemag.com/fpm/271787/florida-lynching-broken-friendship-david-horowitz#.W9hGTpSd8yI.twitter|title=A Florida Lynching & A Broken Friendship|accessdate=2018-10-30}}</ref>\n\nRadosh's political views eventually began to shift towards [[conservatism]] and his work as a historian has been characterized as being of a conservative variety.<ref name=\"The New York Times\">{{cite web|title=Oliver Stone Rewrites History|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/25/magazine/oliver-stone-rewrites-history-again.html|website=The New York Times|accessdate=29 April 2018}}</ref> Currently employed by the [[Hudson Institute]], Radosh has also published books about the activities of [[Joseph Stalin]]'s [[NKVD]] during the [[Spanish Civil War]] and the foundation of the [[State of Israel]].\n\nHis most recent book, co-authored with his wife Allis Radosh, is ''A Safe Haven: Harry S.

Harding, to be published by Simon & Schuster.\n\n==Early life==\n{{BLP sources section|date=November 2016}}\nRadosh was born in New York City. His parents, Reuben Radosh and Ida Kretschman, were [[Jews|Jewish]] immigrants from Eastern Europe. He has stated that his earliest memory is of being taken to a May Day parade in New York's [[Union Square (New York City)|Union Square]].<ref>Ronald Radosh, ''Commies; A Journey Through the [[Old Left]], the [[New Left]], and the Leftover Left'', [[Encounter Books]], 2001. p. 1.</ref>\n\nDuring the 1940s and 1950s, he attended the [[Little Red School House]] and [[Elisabeth Irwin High School]], both of which were private schools attended mainly by the children of New York's Communists. He also attended the Communist-run Camp Woodland for Children in the [[Catskill Mountains]].<ref>''Commies'', Chapter 2, \"Commie Camp\", pp. 15\u201324.</ref> His memoirs vividly describe school-day encounters with [[Mary Travers (singer)|Mary Travers]], [[Woody Guthrie]] and [[Peter Seeger]].<ref>''Commies'', Chapter 3, \"The Little Red Schoolhouse\", pp. 25\u201348.</ref> On June 19, 1953, he demonstrated in [[Union Square (New York City)|Union Square]] with other members of the [[Labor Youth League]] against the execution of [[Julius and Ethel Rosenberg]].<ref>''Commies'', pp. 47\u201348.</ref> He began attending the [[University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison]] in the fall of 1955. He has said that his desire at the time was both to study history, which [[Karl Marx]] considered queen of the sciences, and to become a leader in America's communists.<ref>''Commies'', pp. 49\u201350.</ref> Despite being raised to always defend the actions of the [[Soviet Union]], Radosh developed a close friendship with Prof. [[George Mosse]], a Jewish refugee from [[Nazi Germany]] and anti-Stalinist.<ref>''Commies'', pp. 51\u201352.</ref>\n\nIn 1959, he arrived at the [[University of Iowa]] intending to work towards his [[Master's Degree]]. Despite being raised as a [[red diaper baby]] by fellow travelers, Radosh was shocked by revelations of Stalin's crimes which began to be released during the [[Khrushchev thaw]]. Although he had been a leader of Madison's [[Labor Youth League]], he eventually broke with the Soviet-backed [[Communist Party USA]] and became a founding father of the American [[New Left]].<ref>''Commies'', pp. 65\u201382.</ref> Radosh's fondness for the writings of [[Isaac Deutscher]] enraged the Madison Communist Party cell. Their attempts to bring him back into the [[party line (politics)|party line]] was a major part of Radosh's break with Communism.<ref>''Commies'', p.. 78\u201379.</ref> In 1963, he returned to New York City with his wife and children.\n\n==Vietnam War==\n{{main|Vietnam War}}\n\nAfter teaching at two [[community colleges]] in [[Brooklyn]], Radosh joined New York's chapter of the [[Committee to Stop the War in Vietnam]]. He recalls,\n\n<blockquote>When [[Norman Thomas]] died in 1968, I wrote what may have been the only published negative assessment of his life. Most obituaries heralded Thomas as the nation's conscience, a man of principle who had turned out to be right about a great deal. Of course, Thomas was against the war in Vietnam; he had made a famous speech in which he said he came not to burn the American flag but to cleanse it. But for radicals like myself, that proved that he was a sellout. His opposition to the war was so tame, I argued, that he actually helped the American ruling class. I claimed that Thomas' opposition to LBJ's bombing campaign was only a \"tactical\" difference with the President. Thomas' chief sin, in my view, was to have written that he did not, \"regard Vietcong terrorism as virtuous\". He was guilty of attacking the heroic Vietnamese people, instead of the United States, which was the enemy of the world's people. My final judgment was that Thomas had \"accepted the Cold War, its ideology and ethics and had decided to enlist in fighting its battles\" on the wrong\u2014the anti-communist\u2014side.<ref>''Commies'', pp. 89\u201390.</ref></blockquote>\n\nSoon afterward, Radosh also joined the New York chapter of [[Students for a Democratic Society]].<ref>''Commies'', p. 90.</ref>\n\nIn his book ''Prophets on the Right,'' completed in 1974, Radosh referred to himself as both \"an advocate of a socialist solution to America's domestic crisis\" and \"a radical historian\".<ref>''Prophets on the Right'', pp. 11, 13.</ref> The book profiles several historical conservative or far-right [[isolationism|isolationists]], \"[[United States non-interventionism|critics of American globalism]]\", men who were \"outside the consensus, or the mainstream...

A second edition, published by Yale University Press, in 1997 incorporates newly obtained evidence from the former Soviet Union. Radosh and Milton also condemned prosecutorial misconduct in the case. As a result of their 1983 book and revelations in the Vassiliev papers as well as the Venona decrypts, a consensus has emerged that rather than having been framed by the US government, both Rosenbergs were Soviet agents, and Julius Rosenberg was an agent who put together an active network that stole significant military secrets for the Soviet Union. Co-defendant Morton Sobell's 2008 interview with Sam Roberts of ''The New York Times'' had him admit his own guilt and that of Julius Rosenberg, after years of proclaiming his innocence, supporting the thesis of ''The Rosenberg File''. A year later, Radosh and Steven Usdin held an interview with Sobell;  writing in ''The Weekly Standard'', Sobell outlined the dimensions of the material he passed to the Soviets as part of the Rosenberg network.\n\nHis memoirs, published in 2001, are titled ''Commies: A Journey Through the Old Left, the New Left, and the Leftover Left''. The memoir discusses the various reasons for his disillusionment with the Left and utopian Marxist solutions, including his mid-1970s trip to Cuba, his experiences in [[Central America]] in the 1980s, and how he was read out of the Left because he dared to tell the truth about the espionage of the Rosenbergs.\n\nRadosh is currently an adjunct fellow at the Hudson Institute in Washington, D.C.,<ref>http://www.hudson.org/learn/index.cfm?fuseaction=staff_bio&eid=RadoshRon</ref> and professor of history emeritus at the [[City University of New York]],<ref>http://www.qcc.cuny.edu/History/</ref> where he was a faculty member at both Queensborough Community College and the Graduate Faculty in History at CUNY.\n\n==Family==\nRadosh married Alice Schweig on the summer of 1959.

As described in his memoirs, Radosh was\u2014like his parents\u2014a member of the [[Communist Party of the United States of America]] until the [[Khrushchev thaw]]. Subsequently, he became a [[New Left]] and anti-Vietnam War activist.\n\nLater, Radosh turned his attention to Julius and Ethel Rosenberg. After studying declassified FBI documents and interviewing their friends and associates, Radosh concluded that [[Julius and Ethel Rosenberg]] were indeed guilty of spying for the [[KGB]]. According to one-time friend [[David Horowitz]], Radosh's decision to publish his findings led to his social ostracism; his friendship with Horowitz of 65 years ended in 2016 when Horowitz endorsed [[Donald Trump]] for president.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.frontpagemag.com/fpm/271787/florida-lynching-broken-friendship-david-horowitz#.W9hGTpSd8yI.twitter|title=A Florida Lynching & A Broken Friendship|accessdate=2018-10-30}}</ref>\n\nRadosh's political views eventually began to shift towards [[conservatism]] and his work as a historian has been characterized as being of a conservative variety.<ref name=\"The New York Times\">{{cite web|title=Oliver Stone Rewrites History|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/25/magazine/oliver-stone-rewrites-history-again.html|website=The New York Times|accessdate=29 April 2018}}</ref> Currently employed by the [[Hudson Institute]], Radosh has also published books about the activities of [[Joseph Stalin]]'s [[NKVD]] during the [[Spanish Civil War]] and the foundation of the [[State of Israel]].\n\nHis most recent book, co-authored with his wife Allis Radosh, is ''A Safe Haven: Harry S.

Harding, to be published by Simon & Schuster.\n\n==Early life==\n{{BLP sources section|date=November 2016}}\nRadosh was born in New York City. His parents, Reuben Radosh and Ida Kretschman, were [[Jews|Jewish]] immigrants from Eastern Europe. He has stated that his earliest memory is of being taken to a May Day parade in New York's [[Union Square (New York City)|Union Square]].<ref>Ronald Radosh, ''Commies; A Journey Through the [[Old Left]], the [[New Left]], and the Leftover Left'', [[Encounter Books]], 2001. p. 1.</ref>\n\nDuring the 1940s and 1950s, he attended the [[Little Red School House]] and [[Elisabeth Irwin High School]], both of which were private schools attended mainly by the children of New York's Communists. He also attended the Communist-run Camp Woodland for Children in the [[Catskill Mountains]].<ref>''Commies'', Chapter 2, \"Commie Camp\", pp. 15\u201324.</ref> His memoirs vividly describe school-day encounters with [[Mary Travers (singer)|Mary Travers]], [[Woody Guthrie]] and [[Peter Seeger]].<ref>''Commies'', Chapter 3, \"The Little Red Schoolhouse\", pp. 25\u201348.</ref> On June 19, 1953, he demonstrated in [[Union Square (New York City)|Union Square]] with other members of the [[Labor Youth League]] against the execution of [[Julius and Ethel Rosenberg]].<ref>''Commies'', pp. 47\u201348.</ref> He began attending the [[University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison]] in the fall of 1955. He has said that his desire at the time was both to study history, which [[Karl Marx]] considered queen of the sciences, and to become a leader in America's communists.<ref>''Commies'', pp. 49\u201350.</ref> Despite being raised to always defend the actions of the [[Soviet Union]], Radosh developed a close friendship with Prof. [[George Mosse]], a Jewish refugee from [[Nazi Germany]] and anti-Stalinist.<ref>''Commies'', pp. 51\u201352.</ref>\n\nIn 1959, he arrived at the [[University of Iowa]] intending to work towards his [[Master's Degree]]. Despite being raised as a [[red diaper baby]] by fellow travelers, Radosh was shocked by revelations of Stalin's crimes which began to be released during the [[Khrushchev thaw]]. Although he had been a leader of Madison's [[Labor Youth League]], he eventually broke with the Soviet-backed [[Communist Party USA]] and became a founding father of the American [[New Left]].<ref>''Commies'', pp. 65\u201382.</ref> Radosh's fondness for the writings of [[Isaac Deutscher]] enraged the Madison Communist Party cell. Their attempts to bring him back into the [[party line (politics)|party line]] was a major part of Radosh's break with Communism.<ref>''Commies'', p.. 78\u201379.</ref> In 1963, he returned to New York City with his wife and children.\n\n==Vietnam War==\n{{main|Vietnam War}}\n\nAfter teaching at two [[community colleges]] in [[Brooklyn]], Radosh joined New York's chapter of the [[Committee to Stop the War in Vietnam]]. He recalls,\n\n<blockquote>When [[Norman Thomas]] died in 1968, I wrote what may have been the only published negative assessment of his life. Most obituaries heralded Thomas as the nation's conscience, a man of principle who had turned out to be right about a great deal. Of course, Thomas was against the war in Vietnam; he had made a famous speech in which he said he came not to burn the American flag but to cleanse it. But for radicals like myself, that proved that he was a sellout. His opposition to the war was so tame, I argued, that he actually helped the American ruling class. I claimed that Thomas' opposition to LBJ's bombing campaign was only a \"tactical\" difference with the President. Thomas' chief sin, in my view, was to have written that he did not, \"regard Vietcong terrorism as virtuous\". He was guilty of attacking the heroic Vietnamese people, instead of the United States, which was the enemy of the world's people. My final judgment was that Thomas had \"accepted the Cold War, its ideology and ethics and had decided to enlist in fighting its battles\" on the wrong\u2014the anti-communist\u2014side.<ref>''Commies'', pp. 89\u201390.</ref></blockquote>\n\nSoon afterward, Radosh also joined the New York chapter of [[Students for a Democratic Society]].<ref>''Commies'', p. 90.</ref>\n\nIn his book ''Prophets on the Right,'' completed in 1974, Radosh referred to himself as both \"an advocate of a socialist solution to America's domestic crisis\" and \"a radical historian\".<ref>''Prophets on the Right'', pp. 11, 13.</ref> The book profiles several historical conservative or far-right [[isolationism|isolationists]], \"[[United States non-interventionism|critics of American globalism]]\", men who were \"outside the consensus, or the mainstream... [and] regarded as subversive of the existing order\"; Radosh's stated aim in writing the book was to \"move us... to think carefully about alternative possibilities\" to \"our current predicament\"\u2014a clear reference to the still-ongoing Vietnam War.<ref>''Prophets on the Right,'' p. 14.</ref>\n\nIn 1976, Radosh was a \"founding sponsor\" of [[James Weinstein (author)|James Weinstein]]'s magazine ''[[In These Times]]''.<ref>\n{{cite web\n| title = About\n| publisher = In These Times\n| url = http://inthesetimes.com/about\n| date =\n| accessdate = 22 March 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\nRadosh's writings have appeared in ''[[The New Republic]]'', ''[[The Weekly Standard]]'', ''[[National Review]]'', the blog [[Frontpagemag.com]], and many other newspapers and magazines.\n\nIn the 1983 book ''The Rosenberg File'', he and co-author Joyce Milton conclude that Julius Rosenberg was guilty of espionage and that Ethel was aware of his activities.

It flows {{convert|338|km|mi|0}} in a southerly direction from its headwaters at Spanish Lake (west branch) and Duke Lake (east branch) to its mouth at the [[North Channel (Ontario)|North Channel]] on [[Georgian Bay]], [[Lake Huron]] just outside the community of [[Spanish, Ontario|Spanish]].\n\nThe river is located almost entirely within the Sudbury District, except for brief passages into the city of Greater Sudbury near the communities of [[High Falls, Ontario|High Falls]] and [[Turbine, Ontario|Turbine]] and the river mouth in Algoma District.\n\nTributaries include Pogamasing Creek, Mogo Creek, [[Agnes River (Spanish River)|Agnes River]], the [[Aux Sables River (Spanish River)|Aux Sables River]], the [[Vermilion River (Sudbury District)|Vermilion River]] and the [[Wakonassin River (Ontario)|Wakonassin River]].\n\nThe river's name and the name of the nearby towns of [[Espanola, Ontario|Espanola]] and Spanish are said to be due to French explorers and Jesuit priests encountering [[Ojibwe]] peoples speaking Spanish in the area, apparently as a result of a Spanish woman having been taken captive during an expedition far to the south.\n\nThe Lower Spanish River Forest houses the world's oldest [[red pine]] and [[Eastern White Pine|white pine]] forests, and much of that is under provincial protection, in the form of provincial parks and reclamation acts.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Espanola Ontario.JPG|thumb|225px|left|Spanish River and [[Domtar]] Mill in [[Espanola, Ontario|Espanola]]]]\nThis river has been used as a transportation corridor for thousands of years, first by [[First Nations]] and later in the 19th century by [[fur trader]]s. During the late 19th and mid 20th centuries, it was used to transport timber from logging camps in the upper Sudbury District to Georgian Bay, where they were towed by tugs to sawmills on the [[Great Lakes]].  Until the mid-1960s pulp wood, mainly jack pine, was driven down the river to the paper mill at Espanola. A diesel tug towed large rafts of logs the length of Agnew Lake to big Eddy dam where they were sluiced down a flume by crews with hand held pike poles.  Secondary flumes took them past the High Falls and Nairn Falls power plants and on to Espanola.  The sap and bark from the pulp logs was a major pollution source in the lower river.\n\nToday the river is mainly used for recreational [[canoe]]ing and has been protected as a waterway [[Ontario Parks|provincial park]]. All park sites and portages are currently maintained by park staff. There are four hydroelectric dams on the river: one, known as Big Eddy, above [[High Falls, Ontario|High Falls]] forming Lake Agnew; High Falls dam about a kilometer below Big Eddy dam; [[Nairn Falls Dam and Generating Plant|Nairn Falls dam]] about 12&nbsp;km below High Falls and the other at the Domtar mill in Espanola.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of rivers of

[[Algoma District]], [[Sudbury District]] and [[Greater Sudbury]] in [[Northeastern Ontario|Northwestern]] [[Ontario]], Canada. It flows {{convert|338|km|mi|0}} in a southerly direction from its headwaters at Spanish Lake (west branch) and Duke Lake (east branch) to its mouth at the [[North Channel (Ontario)|North Channel]] on [[Georgian Bay]], [[Lake Huron]] just outside the community of [[Spanish, Ontario|Spanish]].\n\nThe river is located almost entirely within the Sudbury District, except for brief passages into the city of Greater Sudbury near the communities of [[High Falls, Ontario|High Falls]] and [[Turbine, Ontario|Turbine]] and the river mouth in Algoma District.\n\nTributaries include Pogamasing Creek, Mogo Creek, [[Agnes River (Spanish River)|Agnes River]], the [[Aux Sables River (Spanish River)|Aux Sables River]], the [[Vermilion River (Sudbury District)|Vermilion River]] and the [[Wakonassin River (Ontario)|Wakonassin River]].\n\nThe river's name and the name of the nearby towns of [[Espanola, Ontario|Espanola]] and Spanish are said to be due to French explorers and Jesuit priests encountering [[Ojibwe]] peoples speaking Spanish in the area, apparently as a result of a Spanish woman having been taken captive during an expedition far to the south.\n\nThe Lower Spanish River Forest houses the world's oldest [[red pine]] and [[Eastern White Pine|white pine]] forests, and much of that is under provincial protection, in the form of provincial parks and reclamation acts.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Espanola Ontario.JPG|thumb|225px|left|Spanish River and [[Domtar]] Mill in [[Espanola, Ontario|Espanola]]]]\nThis river has been used as a transportation corridor for thousands of years, first by [[First Nations]] and later in the 19th century by [[fur trader]]s. During the late 19th and mid 20th centuries, it was used to transport timber from logging camps in the upper Sudbury District to Georgian Bay, where they were towed by tugs to sawmills on the [[Great Lakes]].  Until the mid-1960s pulp wood, mainly jack pine, was driven down the river to the paper mill at Espanola. A diesel tug towed large rafts of logs the length of Agnew Lake to big Eddy dam where they were sluiced down a flume by crews with hand held pike poles.  Secondary flumes took them past the High Falls and Nairn Falls power plants and on to Espanola.  The sap and bark from the pulp logs was a major pollution source in the lower river.\n\nToday the river is mainly used for recreational [[canoe]]ing and has been protected as a waterway [[Ontario Parks|provincial park]]. All park sites and portages are currently maintained by park staff. There are four hydroelectric dams on the river: one, known as Big Eddy, above [[High Falls, Ontario|High Falls]] forming Lake Agnew; High Falls dam about a kilometer below Big Eddy dam; [[Nairn Falls Dam and Generating Plant|Nairn Falls dam]] about 12&nbsp;km below High Falls and the other at the Domtar mill in Espanola.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of rivers of Ontario]]\n\n==Sources==\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{cite cgndb|id= FCQWG|title= Spanish River|accessdate=March 6, 2011}}\n*{{cite web |title= Spanish River|publisher= [[Natural Resources Canada]]|date= February 4, 2010|work= [[Atlas of Canada]] |url= http://atlas.nrcan.gc.ca/site/english/maps/topo/map?mapsize=750%20666&mapxy=1012419.51734%20-153194.624003&scale=1200000&feature_na=Spanish%20River&searchstring=Spanish%20River&layers=fapfeature%20fapfeature%20north_arrow%20other_features%20million_grid%20t50k_grid%20grid_50k_3%20roads%20hydrography%20boundary%20builtup%20vegetation%20populated_places%20railway%20power_network%20manmade_features%20designated_areas%20water_features%20water_saturated_soils%20relief%20contours%20toponymy%20contour%20nodata_ntdb_50k&map_layer%5bnortharrow%5d_class%5b0%5d_style%5b0%5d=ANGLE%20-12.038568313736846&urlappend=%26unique_key%3D0936b4a4d05411d892e2080020a0f4c9%26map.layer%5btextzoom03%5d%3DFEATURE+POINTS+984695.006677+-216303.380467+END+TEXT+%22Spanish+River%22+END%26map.layer%5btextzoom46%5d%3DFEATURE+POINTS+984695.006677+-216303.380467+END+TEXT+%22Spanish+River%22+END%26map.layer%5blineresultzoom0%5d%3DDATA+fap_rivers%26map.layer%5blineresultzoom1%5d%3DDATA+fap_rivers%26map.layer%5blineresultzoom2%5d%3DDATA+fap_rivers%26map.layer%5barrowzoom03%5d%3DFEATURE+POINTS+984695.006677+-216303.380467+END+END  |accessdate=March 6, 2011}} Shows the river course.\n*{{cite web|url= http://atlas.nrcan.gc.ca/site/english/learningresources/facts/rivers.html/#atlantic |title= Facts about Canada \u2013 Rivers \u2013 Rivers Flowing into the Atlantic Ocean|work= Atlas of Canada|publisher= [[Natural Resources Canada]]|date= October 25, 2010|accessdate=March 6, 2011}}\n{{refend}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.spanishriver.ca The Spanish River, connected waterways]\n* [http://www.ancientforest.org/spanish.html Canoeing the Ancient Forest of the Spanish River]\n* [http://www.webshots.com/search?media=photo&query=%22spanish+river%22&queryChannel=travel&sortBy=&source=search_menu Webshots, Great Pictures from Spanish River]\n\n[[Category:Rivers of Algoma District]]\n[[Category:Rivers of Sudbury District]]\n[[Category:Rivers of Greater Sudbury]]\n[[Category:Tributaries of Lake Huron]]\n", "name_user": "Pogamasing", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eSources", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_River_(Ontario)"}

The SNU said that it had liquidated the publication due to financial losses, to the dismay of thousands of readers around the world who did not understand why Britain's oldest Spiritualist newspaper was terminated with almost no notice.\n\nIn 2011 the paper resumed publication with issue #4067 dated 17 December 2011, after the publisher was purchased by the JV Trust in October of that year.<ref>{{Citation | url=http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=1&storycode=48464&c=1 | title=Life after death for Psychic News | author=Jensen, Christian | newspaper=[[Press Gazette]] | date=20 December 2011 | accessdate=20 December 2011 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120105112429/http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=1&storycode=48464&c=1 | archivedate=5 January 2012 }}</ref>.   As at 2019, ''Psychic News'' is still being published, but now as a monthly magazine.\n\n==Topics covered==\nAlthough the primary focus of the ''Psychic News'' was always Spiritualism, and it was strongly associated with the SNU even before that organization acquired ownership of it, it was the policy of PN to cover a wide variety of subjects of interest to its readers. For instance, in November 1947 the paper covered the fact that a committee of Anglican ministers had supported Spiritualism in 1936 and that the report had been suppressed by the [[Anglican Church]]. This investigative report by the ''Psychic News'' caused the ''Psychic News'' itself to become the topic of articles in ''[[The New York Times]]'' and the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.<ref name=\"nyt\">{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1947/11/09/archives/spiritualists-win-support-in-britain-report-suppressed-in-1936.html |title=Spiritualists Win Support in Britain; Report Suppressed in 1936 Shows Special Study Group Endorsed Principles |date=Nov 9, 1947 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=2011-05-25}}</ref><ref name=\"latimes\">{{cite news |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/420108131.html?dids=420108131:420108131&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:AI&type=historic&date=Nov+09%2C+1947&author=&pub=Los+Angeles+Times&desc=Committee+of+Anglicans+Supports+Spiritualism&pqatl=google |title=Committee of Anglicans Supports Spiritualism: Long-Suppressed Church of England Report on Psychic Data Published |date=Nov 9, 1947 |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |accessdate=2011-05-25}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, with the rise of the [[neopagan]] religion of [[Wicca]], several articles about Wicca and [[witchcraft]] were published in the magazine, including \"Genuine Witchcraft Is Defended\" by [[Roy Bowers|Robert Cochrane]]. From that time forward the newspaper dealt with other [[paranormal]], [[supernatural]] and [[New Age]] topics in addition to spiritualism.\n\n==Reception==\n\nThe newspaper has been criticized for biased reporting and endorsing fraudulent mediums and psychics as genuine.

The newspaper was next supported by the Spiritual Truth Foundation (STF).

For instance, in November 1947 the paper covered the fact that a committee of Anglican ministers had supported Spiritualism in 1936 and that the report had been suppressed by the [[Anglican Church]]. This investigative report by the ''Psychic News'' caused the ''Psychic News'' itself to become the topic of articles in ''[[The New York Times]]'' and the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.<ref name=\"nyt\">{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1947/11/09/archives/spiritualists-win-support-in-britain-report-suppressed-in-1936.html |title=Spiritualists Win Support in Britain; Report Suppressed in 1936 Shows Special Study Group Endorsed Principles |date=Nov 9, 1947 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=2011-05-25}}</ref><ref name=\"latimes\">{{cite news |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/420108131.html?dids=420108131:420108131&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:AI&type=historic&date=Nov+09%2C+1947&author=&pub=Los+Angeles+Times&desc=Committee+of+Anglicans+Supports+Spiritualism&pqatl=google |title=Committee of Anglicans Supports Spiritualism: Long-Suppressed Church of England Report on Psychic Data Published |date=Nov 9, 1947 |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |accessdate=2011-05-25}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, with the rise of the [[neopagan]] religion of [[Wicca]], several articles about Wicca and [[witchcraft]] were published in the magazine, including \"Genuine Witchcraft Is Defended\" by [[Roy Bowers|Robert Cochrane]]. From that time forward the newspaper dealt with other [[paranormal]], [[supernatural]] and [[New Age]] topics in addition to spiritualism.\n\n==Reception==\n\nThe newspaper has been criticized for biased reporting and endorsing fraudulent mediums and psychics as genuine.

It was founded by [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] drummer [[Dave Grohl]] as a one-man project following the dissolution of Nirvana after the [[Murder of Kurt Cobain]]. The group got its name from the [[unidentified flying object|UFO]]s and various aerial phenomena that were reported by [[Allies of World War II|Allied aircraft pilots]] in [[World War II]], which were known collectively as \"[[foo fighter]]s\".\n\nPrior to the release of Foo Fighters' 1995 debut album ''[[Foo Fighters (album)|Foo Fighters]]'', which featured Grohl as the only official member, Grohl recruited bassist [[Nate Mendel]] and drummer [[William Goldsmith]], both formerly of [[Sunny Day Real Estate]], as well as Nirvana touring guitarist [[Pat Smear]] to complete the lineup. The band began with performances in [[Portland, Oregon]]. Goldsmith quit during the recording of the group's second album, ''[[The Colour and the Shape]]'' (1997), when most of the drum parts were re-recorded by Grohl himself. Smear's departure followed soon afterward, though he would appear as a guest with the band frequently starting in 2006, and would rejoin as an official full-time member in 2011.\n\nThey were replaced by [[Taylor Hawkins]] and [[Franz Stahl]], respectively, although Stahl was fired before the recording of the group's third album, ''[[There Is Nothing Left to Lose]]'' (1999). The band briefly continued as a trio until [[Chris Shiflett]] joined on guitar after the completion of ''There Is Nothing Left to Lose''. The band released its fourth album, ''[[One by One (Foo Fighters album)|One by One]]'', in 2002. The group followed that release with the two-disc ''[[In Your Honor]]'' (2005), which was split between [[Acoustic music|acoustic]] songs and heavier material. Foo Fighters released its sixth album, ''[[Echoes, Silence, Patience & Grace]]'', in 2007. The band's seventh studio album, ''[[Wasting Light]]'', produced by [[Butch Vig]], was released in 2011, in which Smear returned as a full member. In November 2014, the band's eighth studio album, ''[[Sonic Highways]]'', was released as an accompanying soundtrack to the Grohl-directed [[Foo Fighters: Sonic Highways|2014 miniseries]] of the same name. On September 15, 2017, the band released their ninth studio album, ''[[Concrete and Gold]]'', which became their second to reach number one in the United States and was the band's first studio album to feature longtime session and touring keyboardist [[Rami Jaffee]] as a full member.\n\nOver the course of the band's career, four of its albums have won [[Grammy Award]]s for [[Grammy Award for Best Rock Album|Best Rock Album]]. {{as of|2015}}, the band has sold 12 million units in the United States alone.<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/rockandpopfeatures/11684482/Dave-Grohl-interview-Im-going-to-fix-my-leg-and-then-Im-going-to-come-back.html \"Dave Grohl interview: 'I\u2019m going to fix my leg and then I\u2019m going to come back'\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150619045037/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/rockandpopfeatures/11684482/Dave-Grohl-interview-Im-going-to-fix-my-leg-and-then-Im-going-to-come-back.html |date=June 19, 2015 }}. telegraph.co.uk, June 18, 2015.

During tours, he took a guitar with him and wrote songs. Grohl held back these songs from the rest of the band; he said in 1997, \"I was in awe of [frontman [[Kurt Cobain]]'s songs], and [I was] intimidated.

The show on March 3 had been part of a benefit gig to aid the finances of the investigation into the rape and murder of [[The Gits]] singer [[Mia Zapata]]. Grohl refused to do interviews or tour large venues to promote the album.<ref name=\"Breakout\" /> Foo Fighters undertook its first major tour in the spring of 1995, opening for [[Mike Watt]].

While Grohl once again wrote all the songs, the rest of the band collaborated on the arrangements. With the sessions nearly complete, Grohl took the rough mixes with him to Los Angeles, intending to finish up his vocal and guitar parts. While there, Grohl realized that he was not happy with how the mixes were turning out, and changed William Goldsmith's \"drum tracks with his own for all but two songs.\"<ref>{{cite news|last1=McDonald|first1=Sam|title=FOO FIGHTERS HAVE FOUND A POST-NIRVANA IDENTITY|publisher=Tribune Publishing Company LLC|id={{ProQuest|342848747}}}}</ref> During the L.A. sessions, Grohl had played drums on the songs. Unhappy with Goldsmith's drumming, Grohl removed it from the recordings and re-recorded the drum tracks. As Goldsmith was about to come down to L.A. to find out why he wasn't being called upon to re-record his parts, he called Mendel from Seattle inquiring if he should make the trip. Grohl then called Goldsmith saying, \"Dude, don't come down here, I'm recording some of the drum tracks\". Shocked by this, Goldsmith met up with Mendel in Seattle and repeated Grohl's claim to be re-recording \"some\" of the tracks. Mendel asked, \"Is that what he told you?\"; Goldsmith affirmed it, and Mendel stated, \"No, man, he did them all\".\n\n[[File:FoosLollBerlin190917-21 (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|Long-time drummer [[Taylor Hawkins]] joined the band in 1997]]\nGrohl explained that he'd wanted the drums to sound a certain way on the album. He wanted Goldsmith to play for the tour even though it would not be his drumming but Grohl's on the album. Feeling betrayed, Goldsmith left the band.<ref>\"Dave had me do 96 takes of one song, and I had to do thirteen hours' worth of takes on another one,\" he points out. \"It just seemed that everything I did wasn't good enough for him, or anyone else. I think that everyone at the label wanted Dave to play drums on the record. The producer ([[Gil Norton]]) wanted him to play drums on the record, and it felt like everyone was trying to get me to quit. But I didn't quit. I played drums on pretty much the whole record. But then, behind my back, Dave re-recorded the whole record without telling me. I found out through Nate, who, well, I won't get into that.

Other singles included \"[[Stacked Actors]]\", \"[[Generator (Foo Fighters song)|Generator]]\", \"[[Next Year]]\" and \"[[Breakout (Foo Fighters song)|Breakout]]\".\n\nBefore the release of the album, [[Capitol Records]] president [[Gary Gersh]] was forced out of the label.

With the album not reaching their expectations, and much infighting amongst the members, Grohl spent some time helping [[Queens of the Stone Age]] complete their 2002 album ''[[Songs for the Deaf]]''. Once the Queens of the Stone Age album was finished, and touring had started for both Foo Fighters and Queens of the Stone Age, the band was on the verge of breaking up entirely as the animosity grew amongst the members. Grohl reconvened with Hawkins, Shiflett and Mendel to have them play at the [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival|Coachella Festival]], with Queens of the Stone Age playing one day and Foo Fighters the following. After the Queens of the Stone Age played, Hawkins and Grohl talked about retrying the ''One by One'' album and had agreed to finishing it and seeing where they would go from there. The group re-recorded nearly all of the album (save \"Tired of You\") in a ten-day stretch at Grohl's home studio in Alexandria, [[Virginia]].<ref name=back/> The original version of ''One by One'', referred to by the band as \"Million Dollar Demos\", has never been heard in its entirety, except for fragments that were leaked.<ref name=spin>{{cite journal|url=https://www.spin.com/2003/07/foo-fighters/|title=The Good Fight|journal=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]|date=November 2002|page=72|first=Alex|last=Pappademas|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160107022246/http://www.spin.com/2003/07/foo-fighters/|archivedate=January 7, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe final album was released in October 2002 under the title ''[[One by One (Foo Fighters album)|One by One]]''.

However, in 2004, upon learning that [[George W.

Grohl acknowledged that Nirvana singer/guitarist [[Kurt Cobain]] was a major influence on his songwriting. Grohl said, \"Through Kurt, I saw the beauty of minimalism and the importance of music that's stripped down\". Foo Fighters also utilized the technique of shifting between quiet verses and loud choruses, which Grohl said was influenced by the members of Nirvana \"liking [[The Knack]], [[Bay City Rollers]], [[The Beatles|Beatles]], and [[ABBA]] as much as we liked [[Flipper (band)|Flipper]] and [[Black Flag (band)|Black Flag]], I suppose\".<ref name=\"Foobulous\" /> Writing and recording songs for the first Foo Fighters album by himself, Grohl wrote the guitar riffs to be as rhythmic as possible. He approached the guitar in a similar manner to his playing a drumkit, assigning different drum parts to different strings on the instrument. This allowed him to piece together songs easily; he said, \"I could hear the song in my head before it was finished.\"<ref name=\"Alien parking\" /> Once Grohl assembled a full band, his bandmates assisted in song arrangements.<ref name=\"Foobulous\" /> [[Pitchfork (website)|''Pitchfork'']] described Grohl and the band as \"his generation's answer to [[Tom Petty]]\u2014a consistent hit machine pumping out working-class rock\".<ref name='Pitchfork'>{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13658-greatest-hits/|title=Album Reviews: Foo Fighters: Greatest Hits|accessdate=May 30, 2010|work=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100702080052/http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13658-greatest-hits/|archivedate=July 2, 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe members of Foo Fighters meld melodic elements with heavier ones. Grohl noted in 1997, \"We all love music, whether it's [[the Beatles]] or [[Queen (band)|Queen]] or [[punk rock]]. I think the lure of punk rock was the energy and immediacy; the need to thrash stuff around. But at the same time, we're all suckers for a beautiful melody, you know?

It was founded by [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] drummer [[Dave Grohl]] as a one-man project following the dissolution of Nirvana after the [[suicide of Kurt Cobain]]. The group got its name from the [[unidentified flying object|UFO]]s and various aerial phenomena that were reported by [[Allies of World War II|Allied aircraft pilots]] in [[World War II]], which were known collectively as \"[[foo fighter]]s\".\n\nPrior to the release of Foo Fighters' 1995 debut album ''[[Foo Fighters (album)|Foo Fighters]]'', which featured Grohl as the only official member, Grohl recruited bassist [[Nate Mendel]] and drummer [[William Goldsmith]], both formerly of [[Sunny Day Real Estate]], as well as Nirvana touring guitarist [[Pat Smear]] to complete the lineup. The band began with performances in [[Portland, Oregon]]. Goldsmith quit during the recording of the group's second album, ''[[The Colour and the Shape]]'' (1997), when most of the drum parts were re-recorded by Grohl himself. Smear's departure followed soon afterward, though he would appear as a guest with the band frequently starting in 2006, and would rejoin as an official full-time member in 2011.\n\nThey were replaced by [[Taylor Hawkins]] and [[Franz Stahl]], respectively, although Stahl was fired before the recording of the group's third album, ''[[There Is Nothing Left to Lose]]'' (1999). The band briefly continued as a trio until [[Chris Shiflett]] joined on guitar after the completion of ''There Is Nothing Left to Lose''. The band released its fourth album, ''[[One by One (Foo Fighters album)|One by One]]'', in 2002. The group followed that release with the two-disc ''[[In Your Honor]]'' (2005), which was split between [[Acoustic music|acoustic]] songs and heavier material. Foo Fighters released its sixth album, ''[[Echoes, Silence, Patience & Grace]]'', in 2007. The band's seventh studio album, ''[[Wasting Light]]'', produced by [[Butch Vig]], was released in 2011, in which Smear returned as a full member. In November 2014, the band's eighth studio album, ''[[Sonic Highways]]'', was released as an accompanying soundtrack to the Grohl-directed [[Foo Fighters: Sonic Highways|2014 miniseries]] of the same name. On September 15, 2017, the band released their ninth studio album, ''[[Concrete and Gold]]'', which became their second to reach number one in the United States and was the band's first studio album to feature longtime session and touring keyboardist [[Rami Jaffee]] as a full member.\n\nOver the course of the band's career, four of its albums have won [[Grammy Award]]s for [[Grammy Award for Best Rock Album|Best Rock Album]]. {{as of|2015}}, the band has sold 12 million units in the United States alone.<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/rockandpopfeatures/11684482/Dave-Grohl-interview-Im-going-to-fix-my-leg-and-then-Im-going-to-come-back.html \"Dave Grohl interview: 'I\u2019m going to fix my leg and then I\u2019m going to come back'\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150619045037/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/rockandpopfeatures/11684482/Dave-Grohl-interview-Im-going-to-fix-my-leg-and-then-Im-going-to-come-back.html |date=June 19, 2015 }}. telegraph.co.uk, June 18, 2015.

They followed that with a show at the Velvet Elvis in Seattle on March 4. The show on March 3 had been part of a benefit gig to aid the finances of the investigation into the rape and murder of [[The Gits]] singer [[Mia Zapata]]. Grohl refused to do interviews or tour large venues to promote the album.<ref name=\"Breakout\" /> Foo Fighters undertook its first major tour in the spring of 1995, opening for [[Mike Watt]]. The band's first single, \"[[This Is a Call]]\", was released in June 1995,<ref name=AMG /> and its debut album ''[[Foo Fighters (album)|Foo Fighters]]'' was released the next month. \"[[I'll Stick Around]]\", \"[[For All the Cows]]\", and \"[[Big Me]]\" were released as subsequent singles.

While Grohl once again wrote all the songs, the rest of the band collaborated on the arrangements. With the sessions nearly complete, Grohl took the rough mixes with him to Los Angeles, intending to finish up his vocal and guitar parts. While there, Grohl realized that he was not happy with how the mixes were turning out, and changed William Goldsmith's \"drum tracks with his own for all but two songs.\"<ref>{{cite news|last1=McDonald|first1=Sam|title=FOO FIGHTERS HAVE FOUND A POST-NIRVANA IDENTITY|publisher=Tribune Publishing Company LLC|id={{ProQuest|342848747}}}}</ref> During the L.A. sessions, Grohl had played drums on the songs. Unhappy with Goldsmith's drumming, Grohl removed it from the recordings and re-recorded the drum tracks. As Goldsmith was about to come down to L.A. to find out why he wasn't being called upon to re-record his parts, he called Mendel from Seattle inquiring if he should make the trip. Grohl then called Goldsmith saying, \"Dude, don't come down here, I'm recording some of the drum tracks\". Shocked by this, Goldsmith met up with Mendel in Seattle and repeated Grohl's claim to be re-recording \"some\" of the tracks. Mendel asked, \"Is that what he told you?\"; Goldsmith affirmed it, and Mendel stated, \"No, man, he did them all\".\n\n[[File:FoosLollBerlin190917-21 (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|Long-time drummer [[Taylor Hawkins]] joined the band in 1997]]\nGrohl explained that he'd wanted the drums to sound a certain way on the album. He wanted Goldsmith to play for the tour even though it would not be his drumming but Grohl's on the album. Feeling betrayed, Goldsmith left the band.<ref>\"Dave had me do 96 takes of one song, and I had to do thirteen hours' worth of takes on another one,\" he points out. \"It just seemed that everything I did wasn't good enough for him, or anyone else. I think that everyone at the label wanted Dave to play drums on the record. The producer ([[Gil Norton]]) wanted him to play drums on the record, and it felt like everyone was trying to get me to quit. But I didn't quit. I played drums on pretty much the whole record. But then, behind my back, Dave re-recorded the whole record without telling me. I found out through Nate, who, well, I won't get into that. But I thought, This is bullshit.\" Roberts, Michael. \"[http://www.miaminewtimes.com/1998-12-03/music/bring-back-that-sunny-day/2 Bring Back That Sunny Day] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103091941/http://www.miaminewtimes.com/1998-12-03/music/bring-back-that-sunny-day/2/ |date=November 3, 2012 }}\".

The album included the singles \"[[Monkey Wrench (song)|Monkey Wrench]]\", \"[[Everlong]]\", \"[[My Hero (song)|My Hero]]\", and \"[[Walking After You]]\"\n\nPat Smear announced to the rest of the group that he wanted to leave the band, claiming exhaustion and burnout, but agreed to stay with the band until a replacement could be found for him. Four months later in September at the [[1997 MTV Video Music Awards]], Smear simultaneously announced to the public his departure from the band and introduced his replacement, Grohl's former [[Scream (band)|Scream]] bandmate [[Franz Stahl]].<ref name=\"Kerrang 1997\">Johnson, Lisa. \"Classic interview: October 1997\".

A [[B-side]] from the \"My Hero\" single, \"Dear Lover\", appeared in the horror film ''[[Scream 2]]''. The tour for ''The Colour and the Shape'' album included a main stage performance at the 1998 [[Glastonbury Festival]] and culminated with a performance at the 1998 [[Reading Festival]], both in England.\n\n=== ''There Is Nothing Left to Lose'' (1998\u20132001) ===\nIn 1998, Foo Fighters traveled to Grohl's home state of Virginia to write music for their third album. However, Grohl and Stahl were unable to co-operate as songwriters; Grohl told ''[[Kerrang!]]'' in 1999, \"in those few weeks it just seemed like the three of us were moving in one direction and Franz wasn't\". Grohl was distraught over the decision to fire Stahl, as the two had been friends since childhood. Shortly after that, Mendel called Grohl to say he was quitting the band to reunite with Sunny Day Real Estate, only to reverse his decision the next day.<ref name=\"Burn away\">Beebee, Steve. \"Burn Away\". ''Kerrang! Legends: Foo Fighters''. 2007.</ref> The remaining trio of Grohl, Mendel, and Hawkins spent the next several months recording the band's third album, ''[[There Is Nothing Left to Lose]]'', in Grohl's Virginia home studio. The album spawned several singles, including \"[[Learn to Fly]]\", the band's first single to reach the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. Other singles included \"[[Stacked Actors]]\", \"[[Generator (Foo Fighters song)|Generator]]\", \"[[Next Year]]\" and \"[[Breakout (Foo Fighters song)|Breakout]]\".\n\nBefore the release of the album, [[Capitol Records]] president [[Gary Gersh]] was forced out of the label. Given Grohl's history with Gersh, Foo Fighters' contract had included a \"key man clause\" that allowed them to leave the label upon Gersh's departure. They subsequently left Capitol and signed with [[RCA Records|RCA]], who later acquired the rights to the band's Capitol albums.<ref name=\"Burn away\" />\n\nAfter recording for ''There Is Nothing Left to Lose'' was completed, the band auditioned a number of potential guitarists, and eventually settled on [[Chris Shiflett]], who performs with [[Me First and the Gimme Gimmes]], and previously performed with California punk band [[No Use for a Name]].

After spending four months in a Los Angeles studio completing the album, the album \"just didn't sound right\" and the band had no confidence in the album to sell many records. With the album not reaching their expectations, and much infighting amongst the members, Grohl spent some time helping [[Queens of the Stone Age]] complete their 2002 album ''[[Songs for the Deaf]]''. Once the Queens of the Stone Age album was finished, and touring had started for both Foo Fighters and Queens of the Stone Age, the band was on the verge of breaking up entirely as the animosity grew amongst the members. Grohl reconvened with Hawkins, Shiflett and Mendel to have them play at the [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival|Coachella Festival]], with Queens of the Stone Age playing one day and Foo Fighters the following. After the Queens of the Stone Age played, Hawkins and Grohl talked about retrying the ''One by One'' album and had agreed to finishing it and seeing where they would go from there. The group re-recorded nearly all of the album (save \"Tired of You\") in a ten-day stretch at Grohl's home studio in Alexandria, [[Virginia]].<ref name=back/> The original version of ''One by One'', referred to by the band as \"Million Dollar Demos\", has never been heard in its entirety, except for fragments that were leaked.<ref name=spin>{{cite journal|url=https://www.spin.com/2003/07/foo-fighters/|title=The Good Fight|journal=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]|date=November 2002|page=72|first=Alex|last=Pappademas|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160107022246/http://www.spin.com/2003/07/foo-fighters/|archivedate=January 7, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe final album was released in October 2002 under the title ''[[One by One (Foo Fighters album)|One by One]]''.

The tour for the album included a headline performance at the 2002 [[Reading and Leeds Festivals]].\n\nFor most of its history, the band chose to stay away from the political realm. However, in 2004, upon learning that [[George W. Bush]]'s presidential campaign was using \"Times Like These\" at rallies, Grohl decided to lend his public support to [[John Kerry]]'s campaign \u2013 \"There's no way of stopping the president playing your songs, so I went out and played it for John Kerry's people instead, where I thought the message would kinda make more sense\".<ref name=xfm>{{cite web|url=http://www.xfm.co.uk/news/2005/x-clusive-foo-fighters-vs-president-george-w-bush|title=X-clusive: Foo Fighters Vs President George W Bush|date=May 11, 2005|publisher=[[XFM]]|accessdate=December 21, 2011|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120828074927/http://www.xfm.co.uk/news/2005/x-clusive-foo-fighters-vs-president-george-w-bush|archivedate=August 28, 2012}}</ref> Grohl attended several Kerry rallies and occasionally performed solo acoustic sets.

Grohl acknowledged that Nirvana singer/guitarist [[Kurt Cobain]] was a major influence on his songwriting. Grohl said, \"Through Kurt, I saw the beauty of minimalism and the importance of music that's stripped down\". Foo Fighters also utilized the technique of shifting between quiet verses and loud choruses, which Grohl said was influenced by the members of Nirvana \"liking [[The Knack]], [[Bay City Rollers]], [[The Beatles|Beatles]], and [[ABBA]] as much as we liked [[Flipper (band)|Flipper]] and [[Black Flag (band)|Black Flag]], I suppose\".<ref name=\"Foobulous\" /> Writing and recording songs for the first Foo Fighters album by himself, Grohl wrote the guitar riffs to be as rhythmic as possible. He approached the guitar in a similar manner to his playing a drumkit, assigning different drum parts to different strings on the instrument. This allowed him to piece together songs easily; he said, \"I could hear the song in my head before it was finished.\"<ref name=\"Alien parking\" /> Once Grohl assembled a full band, his bandmates assisted in song arrangements.<ref name=\"Foobulous\" /> [[Pitchfork (website)|''Pitchfork'']] described Grohl and the band as \"his generation's answer to [[Tom Petty]]\u2014a consistent hit machine pumping out working-class rock\".<ref name='Pitchfork'>{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13658-greatest-hits/|title=Album Reviews: Foo Fighters: Greatest Hits|accessdate=May 30, 2010|work=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100702080052/http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13658-greatest-hits/|archivedate=July 2, 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe members of Foo Fighters meld melodic elements with heavier ones. Grohl noted in 1997, \"We all love music, whether it's [[the Beatles]] or [[Queen (band)|Queen]] or [[punk rock]]. I think the lure of punk rock was the energy and immediacy; the need to thrash stuff around. But at the same time, we're all suckers for a beautiful melody, you know? So it is just natural.\"<ref name=\"Foobulous\" /> Grohl said in 2005, \"I love being in a rock band, but I don't know if I necessarily wanna be in an alternative rock band from the 1990s for the rest of my life.\" Grohl noted that the band's acoustic tour was an attempt to broaden the group's sound.<ref>Chick, Steve. \"Foo Fighters: 'Touring the UK?
