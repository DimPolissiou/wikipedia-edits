Over the next two years, the squad serves in campaigns in [[Allied invasion of Sicily|Sicily]], where they are given intelligence by Matteo (Matteo Zoffoli), who informed them the location of a [[Tiger I]] [[Heavy tank|tank]] and fed by grateful Sicilian women, [[Omaha Beach]] at the start of the [[Normandy landings|Normandy Campaign]], the [[Operation Overlord|liberation of France]], where they battle Germans inside a mental asylum, and the [[Western Allied invasion of Germany|invasion of western Germany]].\n\nThe sergeant's German counterpart, Schroeder ([[Siegfried Rauch]]), participates in many of the same battles and displays a ruthless loyalty to [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] and [[Nazi Germany|Germany]]. At different times, he and the sergeant express the same sentiment that soldiers are killers, but not murderers.\n\nDuring the advance across northern [[France]], the squad crosses the same field where the sergeant killed the surrendering German, where a memorial now stands.\n\nThe squad's final action in the war is the liberation of Falkenau [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camp]] in [[Czechoslovakia]]. Shortly after this, the sergeant is in a forest at night, having just buried a young boy he had befriended earlier after liberating the camp. Schroeder approaches, attempting to surrender, but the sergeant stabs him. His squad then arrives, and informs him that the \"war's been over for four hours.\" This time, as the squad walks away, Pvt.

However, only a single source provides any details of the language itself: a letter by the [[Flemings|Flemish]] ambassador [[Ogier Ghiselin de Busbecq]], dated 1562 and first published in 1589, gives a list of some eighty words and a song supposedly in the language.\n\nBusbecq's account is problematic in a number of ways. First, his [[informant (linguistics)|informants]] were not unimpeachable; one was a Greek speaker who knew Crimean Gothic as a second language, and the other was a Goth who had abandoned his native language in favour of Greek. Second, Busbecq's transcription was likely influenced by his own language, a [[Flemish]] dialect of [[Dutch language|Dutch]]. Finally, there are undoubted [[typographical error]]s in known extant versions of the account.\n\nNonetheless, much of the vocabulary cited by Busbecq is unmistakably Germanic and was recognised by him as such:\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 100%; text-align: center;\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Crimean Gothic\n! rowspan=\"2\" |[[Gothic language|Bible Gothic]]\n! rowspan=\"2\" |[[English language|English]]\n! rowspan=\"2\" |[[Dutch language|Dutch]]\n! rowspan=\"2\" |[[Low German|Low Saxon]]\n! rowspan=\"2\" |[[German language|German]]\n! rowspan=\"2\" |[[Faroese language|Faroese]]\n! rowspan=\"2\" |[[Icelandic language|Icelandic]]\n! rowspan=\"2\" |[[Danish language|Danish]]\n! colspan=\"2\" |[[Norwegian language|Norwegian]]\n! rowspan=\"2\" |[[Swedish language|Swedish]]\n|-\n![[Bokm\u00e5l]]\n![[Nynorsk]]\n|-\n| apel || apls (m.) || apple || appel \n|appel / Appel|| Apfel || epli ('potato') || epli \n|\u00e6ble\n| colspan=\"2\" |eple|| \u00e4pple ('apple')<br />apel (''[[Malus]]'') \n|-\n| handa || handus (f.) || colspan=\"2\" | hand\n|haand|| Hand || hond || h\u00f6nd \n| colspan=\"2\" |h\u00e5nd|| colspan=\"2\" | hand \n|-\n| schuuester || swistar (f.) || sister || zus(ter) \n|zus / Sester|| Schwester || colspan=\"2\" | systir\n| colspan=\"2\" |s\u00f8ster|| colspan=\"2\" | syster \n|-\n| hus || -h\u016bs (n.) || house || huis \n|hoes / huus|| Haus || colspan=\"2\" | h\u00fas\n| colspan=\"4\" |hus\n|-\n| reghen || rign (n.) || rain || regen \n|regen / reagn|| Regen || colspan=\"6\" | regn \n|-\n| singhen || siggwan (vb.) || sing || zingen \n|zingen / sing|| singen || colspan=\"2\" | syngja\n| colspan=\"2\" |synge|| syngja || sjunga \n|-\n| geen || gaggan (vb.) || go || gaan \n|gaon|| gehen || colspan=\"2\" | ganga\n| colspan=\"4\" |g\u00e5\n|}\n\n(Note:  [[Central consonant|Medial]] -''gg''- in the Biblical Gothic examples represents {{IPA|/\u014bg/}})\n\nBusbecq also cites a number of words which he did not recognise but which are now known to have Germanic [[cognate]]s:\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 100%; text-align: center;\"\n|-\n!width=\"100\"| Crimean Gothic\n![[Gothic language|Bible Gothic]]\n!

This variation may indicate either a gender distinction or [[allomorph]]y &mdash; the latter whereof would be somewhat akin to the English \"the\", which is pronounced either {{IPA|/\u00f0\u0259/}} or {{IPA|/\u00f0i\u02d0/}}.\n\n==Identification and classification==\nWhile the initial identification of this language as \"Gothic\" probably rests on ethnological rather than linguistic grounds \u2014 that is, the speakers were identified as Goths, and therefore the language must be Gothic \u2014 it appears to share a number of distinctive phonological developments with the Gothic of [[Ulfilas]]' Bible. For example, the word ''ada'' 'egg' shows the typical Gothic \"sharpening\" of [[Proto-Germanic language|Proto-Germanic]] {{nowrap|*''-jj-''}} to ''-ddj-'' (as in [[Gothic language|Ulfilian Gothic]] ''iddja'' \"went\" from PGmc. *''ijj\u0113''), being from Proto-Germanic *''ajja-''.\n\nThere are also examples of features preserved in Crimean Gothic and Biblical Gothic but which have undergone changes in West and North Germanic. For example, both Crimean Gothic and Biblical Gothic preserve Germanic {{IPA|/z/}} as a [[sibilant]], while it became {{IPA|/r/}} in all other Germanic dialects: Crimean Gothic ''ies'' and Biblical Gothic ''is'' vs. German ''er'', all meaning 'he'. Also, Crimean Gothic and Biblical Gothic both preserve the medial -''d''- in their reflexes of Proto-Germanic *''fedw\u014dr'' (stem *''fedur-'') 'four': ''fyder'' in the former and ''fidw\u014dr'' in the latter. This -''d''- is lost in all North and West Germanic languages, which have forms descending from *''feww\u014dr'' or *''feur'': Old English ''f\u0113ower'', Old Saxon ''fiuwar'', Old High German ''fior'', Old Norse ''fj\u00f3rir''.\n\nHowever, there are problems in assuming that Crimean Gothic simply represents a later stage in the development of the Gothic attested in Ulfilas' Bible. Some innovations in Biblical Gothic are not found in Crimean Gothic. For example:\n* Crimean Gothic preserves Germanic {{IPA|/e/}}, whereas in Biblical Gothic it has become {{IPA|/i/}}, e.g. Crimean Gothic ''reghen'' and ''suuester'' vs. Biblical Gothic ''rign'' and ''swistar''\n* Crimean Gothic preserves Germanic {{IPA|/u/}} before {{IPA|/r/}}, whereas Biblical Gothic has {{IPA|/\u0254/}}, e.g. Crimean Gothic ''vvurt'' vs. Biblical Gothic ''waur\u00fei''.\n\nHowever, there also seem to be developments similar to those that occurred in varieties of West Germanic, such as the change of {{IPA|/\u03b8/}} to a [[stop consonant|stop]], possibly exhibited in Crimean Gothic ''tria'' (cf. Biblical Gothic ''\u00feriu''). Several historical accounts mention similarity of Crimean Gothic to [[Low German]], as well as the intelligibility of Crimean Gothic to German speakers, with the Dutch-speaking Busbecq's account being by far the most important.\n\nThere are two alternative solutions: that Crimean Gothic presents a separate branch of [[East Germanic languages|East Germanic]], distinct from Ulfilas' Gothic; or that Crimean Gothic is actually descended from the dialect of [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic]] settlers who migrated to the Crimea in the early [[Middle Ages]] and whose language was subsequently influenced by Gothic. Both of these possibilities were first suggested in the 19th century and are most recently argued by Stearns and [[Ottar Gr\u00f8nvik|Gr\u00f8nvik]], respectively. While there is no consensus on a definitive solution to this problem, it is accepted that Crimean Gothic is not a descendant of Biblical Gothic.\n\nThe song recorded by Busbecq is less obviously Germanic and has proved impossible to interpret definitively. There is no consensus as to whether it is actually in Crimean Gothic.\n\nIn 1780, [[Stanis\u0142aw Bohusz Siestrze\u0144cewicz]], an [[Archbishop]] of [[Mogilev]], visited the southern coast of [[Crimea]] and [[Sevastopol]]. According to his account, he met some [[Tatars]] who spoke a language similar to [[Plattdeutsch]]; this was probably a form of Crimean Gothic.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_vLsPAAAAQAAJ/page/n183 ''Mithridates oder allgemeine Sprachenkunde''; 1817, S. 168]</ref>\n\n==Other sources ==\nThe only non-Busbecqian additions to this very small corpus are two potentially Crimean Gothic terms from other sources: the first is a [[proper name]], ''Harfidel'', found in a [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] inscription on a grave stone dating from the 5th century AD; the second word, ''razn'' (\"house\"), may have lived on as a loan word meaning \"roof lath\" in the [[Crimean Tatar language]].<ref>Stearns 1978: 37; quoted in Maarten van der Meer, [http://www.grin.com/de/e-book/85128/morphologie-des-krimgotischen  Morphologie des Krimgotischen.

However, only a single source provides any details of the language itself: a letter by the [[Flemings|Flemish]] ambassador [[Ogier Ghiselin de Busbecq]], dated 1562 and first published in 1589, gives a list of some eighty words and a song supposedly in the language.\n\nBusbecq's account is problematic in a number of ways. First, his [[informant (linguistics)|informants]] were not unimpeachable; one was a Greek speaker who knew Crimean Gothic as a second language, and the other was a Goth who had abandoned his native language in favour of Greek. Second, Busbecq's transcription was likely influenced by his own language, a [[Flemish]] dialect of [[Dutch language|Dutch]]. Finally, there are undoubted [[typographical error]]s in known extant versions of the account.\n\nNonetheless, much of the vocabulary cited by Busbecq is unmistakably Germanic and was recognised by him as such:\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 100%; text-align: center;\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Crimean Gothic\n! rowspan=\"2\" |[[Gothic language|Bible Gothic]]\n! rowspan=\"2\" |[[English language|English]]\n! rowspan=\"2\" |[[Dutch language|Dutch]]\n! rowspan=\"2\" |[[Low German|Low Saxon]]\n! rowspan=\"2\" |[[German language|German]]\n! rowspan=\"2\" |[[Faroese language|Faroese]]\n! rowspan=\"2\" |[[Icelandic language|Icelandic]]\n! rowspan=\"2\" |[[Danish language|Danish]]\n! colspan=\"2\" |[[Norwegian language|Norwegian]]\n! rowspan=\"2\" |[[Swedish language|Swedish]]\n|-\n![[Bokm\u00e5l]]\n![[Nynorsk]]\n|-\n| apel || apls (m.) || apple || appel \n|appel / Appel|| Apfel || epli ('potato') || epli \n|\u00e6ble\n| colspan=\"2\" |eple|| \u00e4pple ('apple')<br />apel (''[[Malus]]'') \n|-\n| handa || handus (f.) || colspan=\"2\" | hand\n|haand|| Hand || hond || h\u00f6nd \n| colspan=\"2\" |h\u00e5nd|| colspan=\"2\" | hand \n|-\n| schuuester || swistar (f.) || sister || zus(ter) \n|zus / Sester|| Schwester || colspan=\"2\" | systir\n| colspan=\"2\" |s\u00f8ster|| colspan=\"2\" | syster \n|-\n| hus || -h\u016bs (n.) || house || huis \n|hoes / huus|| Haus || colspan=\"2\" | h\u00fas\n| colspan=\"4\" |hus\n|-\n| reghen || rign (n.) || rain || regen \n|regen / reagn|| Regen || colspan=\"6\" | regn \n|-\n| singhen || siggwan (vb.) || sing || zingen \n|zingen / sing|| singen || colspan=\"2\" | syngja\n| colspan=\"2\" |synge|| syngja || sjunga \n|-\n| geen || gaggan (vb.) || go || gaan \n|gaon|| gehen || colspan=\"2\" | ganga\n| colspan=\"4\" |g\u00e5\n|}\n\n(Note:  [[Central consonant|Medial]] -''gg''- in the Biblical Gothic examples represents {{IPA|/\u014bg/}})\n\nBusbecq also cites a number of words which he did not recognise but which are now known to have Germanic [[cognate]]s:\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 100%; text-align: center;\"\n|-\n!width=\"100\"| Crimean Gothic\n![[Gothic language|Bible Gothic]]\n!

This variation may indicate either a gender distinction or [[allomorph]]y &mdash; the latter whereof would be somewhat akin to the English \"the\", which is pronounced either {{IPA|/\u00f0\u0259/}} or {{IPA|/\u00f0i\u02d0/}}.\n\n==Identification and classification==\nWhile the initial identification of this language as \"Gothic\" probably rests on ethnological rather than linguistic grounds \u2014 that is, the speakers were identified as Goths, and therefore the language must be Gothic \u2014 it appears to share a number of distinctive phonological developments with the Gothic of [[Ulfilas]]' Bible. For example, the word ''ada'' 'egg' shows the typical Gothic \"sharpening\" of [[Proto-Germanic language|Proto-Germanic]] {{nowrap|*''-jj-''}} to ''-ddj-'' (as in [[Gothic language|Ulfilian Gothic]] ''iddja'' \"went\" from PGmc. *''ijj\u0113''), being from Proto-Germanic *''ajja-''.\n\nThere are also examples of features preserved in Crimean Gothic and Biblical Gothic but which have undergone changes in West and North Germanic. For example, both Crimean Gothic and Biblical Gothic preserve Germanic {{IPA|/z/}} as a [[sibilant]], while it became {{IPA|/r/}} in all other Germanic dialects: Crimean Gothic ''ies'' and Biblical Gothic ''is'' vs. German ''er'', all meaning 'he'. Also, Crimean Gothic and Biblical Gothic both preserve the medial -''d''- in their reflexes of Proto-Germanic *''fedw\u014dr'' (stem *''fedur-'') 'four': ''fyder'' in the former and ''fidw\u014dr'' in the latter. This -''d''- is lost in all North and West Germanic languages, which have forms descending from *''feww\u014dr'' or *''feur'': Old English ''f\u0113ower'', Old Saxon ''fiuwar'', Old High German ''fior'', Old Norse ''fj\u00f3rir''.\n\nHowever, there are problems in assuming that Crimean Gothic simply represents a later stage in the development of the Gothic attested in Ulfilas' Bible. Some innovations in Biblical Gothic are not found in Crimean Gothic. For example:\n* Crimean Gothic preserves Germanic {{IPA|/e/}}, whereas in Biblical Gothic it has become {{IPA|/i/}}, e.g. Crimean Gothic ''reghen'' and ''suuester'' vs. Biblical Gothic ''rign'' and ''swistar''\n* Crimean Gothic preserves Germanic {{IPA|/u/}} before {{IPA|/r/}}, whereas Biblical Gothic has {{IPA|/\u0254/}}, e.g. Crimean Gothic ''vvurt'' vs. Biblical Gothic ''waur\u00fei''.\n\nHowever, there also seem to be developments similar to those that occurred in varieties of West Germanic, such as the change of {{IPA|/\u03b8/}} to a [[stop consonant|stop]], possibly exhibited in Crimean Gothic ''tria'' (cf. Biblical Gothic ''\u00feriu''). Several historical accounts mention similarity of Crimean Gothic to [[Low German]], as well as the intelligibility of Crimean Gothic to German speakers, with the Dutch-speaking Busbecq's account being by far the most important.\n\nThere are two alternative solutions: that Crimean Gothic presents a separate branch of [[East Germanic languages|East Germanic]], distinct from Ulfilas' Gothic; or that Crimean Gothic is actually descended from the dialect of [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic]] settlers who migrated to the Crimea in the early [[Middle Ages]] and whose language was subsequently influenced by Gothic. Both of these possibilities were first suggested in the 19th century and are most recently argued by Stearns and [[Ottar Gr\u00f8nvik|Gr\u00f8nvik]], respectively. While there is no consensus on a definitive solution to this problem, it is accepted that Crimean Gothic is not a descendant of Biblical Gothic.\n\nThe song recorded by Busbecq is less obviously Germanic and has proved impossible to interpret definitively. There is no consensus as to whether it is actually in Crimean Gothic.\n\nIn 1780, [[Stanis\u0142aw Bohusz Siestrze\u0144cewicz]], an [[Archbishop]] of [[Mogilev]], visited the southern coast of [[Crimea]] and [[Sevastopol]]. According to his account, he met some [[Tatars]] who spoke a language similar to [[Plattdeutsch]]; this was probably a form of Crimean Gothic.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_vLsPAAAAQAAJ/page/n183 ''Mithridates oder allgemeine Sprachenkunde''; 1817, S. 168]</ref>\n\n==Other sources ==\nThe only non-Busbecqian additions to this very small corpus are two potentially Crimean Gothic terms from other sources: the first is a [[proper name]], ''Harfidel'', found in a [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] inscription on a grave stone dating from the 5th century AD; the second word, ''razn'' (\"house\"), may have lived on as a loan word meaning \"roof lath\" in the [[Crimean Tatar language]].<ref>Stearns 1978: 37; quoted in Maarten van der Meer, [http://www.grin.com/de/e-book/85128/morphologie-des-krimgotischen  Morphologie des Krimgotischen.

The modern headquarters and main production facilities are located in [[Varese]], Italy on the shore of [[Lake Varese]].\n\n==History==\n\n=== 1943\u20141945: From idea to mass production ===\n[[File:Agusta AG.1 biplane .jpg|left|thumb|1910 Agusta AG.1 biplane]]\nIt all began in the early years of the 20th century, when [[Count Giovanni Agusta]] left [[Sicily]] for [[northern Italy]], where he built his first aircraft, the AG.1, four years after the [[Wright brothers]] had made history in the US. The First World War, which demonstrated the prospects of aviation, prompted the count to act decisively \u2014 and in 1923, in the town of [[Samarate]], he founded the Costruzioni Aeronautiche Giovanni Agusta S.A. (usually shortened to [[Agusta]]) aircraft factory. However, in 1927, at the age of 48, he dies and leaves his life's work to his wife Giuseppina and sons, [[Domenico Agusta|Domenico]], Vincenzo, Mario and Corrado.\n\nAircraft orders were plentiful, and business generally went well until [[World War II]] intervened. In 1945, following the provisions of the peace treaty after the war, which were later reiterated in the [[Paris Peace Treaties, 1947]], the production of aircraft was forbidden to [[Italy]], and the Agusta family had to think quick to save their high-tech business and keep their employees in work.\n\nIn the midst of [[World War II]] Count [[Domenico Agusta]] came to the idea that the best way to diversify the business and turn it into a peaceful channel would be to create a motorcycle production. Moreover, he understood that a country gutted by war would need a simple, cheap and efficient machine. Therefore, by August 1943, the engine was ready: a 98 cc single-cylinder [[Two-stroke engine|two-stroke]] with two-stage gear box. And even if the total shortage of spare parts had to resort to the services of the black market, the process was already launched \u2014 and on January 19, 1945, in the town of Cascina Costa (near the [[Milan Malpensa Airport|Malpensa airport]] near Milan), a private company Meccanica Verghera S.r.l. was registered, and in the fall of the same year the first motorcycle was presented.\n\nAt a dealership on Via Piatti in [[Milan]] in late October 1945, the press saw a pre-production model of a light motorcycle with a steel tube rigid frame, a [[Motorcycle fork|girder fork]] and 19-inch wheels. The gas tank was marked with large letters M and V. It was called \"Vespa 98\". However Domenico had had to refuse from the spectacular name Vespa ([[English language|English]]: wasp): by that time it was occupied by [[Piaggio]] for its [[Vespa]] [[motorscooter]]. Therefore, in 1946, the motorcycle was put ro mass production as MV 98 and in two versions: Economica (the version presented a year earlier) and Turismo (it was distinguished by the presence of a three-speed gearbox and a rear suspension). The Turismo ([[English language|English]]: tourist) version proved to be so overwhelmingly popular that before long the Economica ([[English language|English]]: economic) version was discontinued. In 1946, about 50 units were produced.\n\n===Racing philosophy (1945\u20131971)===\n\n[[Image:54-mv-175-cstl.jpg|thumb|left|1954 MV Agusta CSTL 175 Turismo Lusso]]\n[[Image:750 America.JPG|thumb|right|750 America]]\n[[Image:Agostini, Giacomo 1976-08-28.jpg|thumb|right|Giacomo Agostini on the MV Agusta 350 four-cylinder]]\nThe brothers had a passion for mechanical workings and for motorcycle racing. Much like [[Enzo Ferrari]], they produced and sold motorcycles almost exclusively to fund their racing efforts. They were determined to have the best [[Grand Prix motorcycle racing]] team in the world and spared no expense on their passion. MV Agusta produced their first prototype, called \"Vespa 98\", in 1945. After learning that the name had already been registered by [[Piaggio]] for its [[Vespa]] [[motorscooter]], it was referred to simply by the number \u201c98\u201d. In 1948, the company built a 125&nbsp;cc [[two-stroke]] single and entered Franco Bertoni in the Italian Grand Prix. Bertoni won the event held in [[Autodromo Nazionale Monza|Monza]] and instantly put the new motorcycle manufacturer on the map.\n\nIn the [[1949 Grand Prix motorcycle racing season|1949 season]], the 125&nbsp;cc, or ultra light weight class, gained new prestige. More motorcycle manufacturers were competing in the inaugural world championships that were held in Switzerland, Netherlands and Italy. The [[Mondial (motorcycle manufacturer)|Mondial]] 125&nbsp;cc DOHC design dominated the 1949 season. The MV riders placed ninth and tenth in the final standings. In 1950, [[Arturo Magni]] and [[Piero Remor]] joined the company after working with [[Gilera]]. Magni was the chief mechanic and Remor was chief designer.<ref>MV Agusta All production road and racing motorcycles. Mick Walker. Osprey Publishing Limited</ref>  The [[1950 Grand Prix motorcycle racing season|1950 season]] and [[1951 Grand Prix motorcycle racing season|1951 season]] were development years, as the company adopted the [[MV Agusta 125 Sohc|125 Dohc]] [[four-stroke]] engine. Racing efforts only produced a fifth-place finish at the [[Dutch TT]] in 1950. The 1951 results were only slightly better.\n[[Image:1951 125cc Racing engine.JPG|thumb|left|MV racing engine 125&nbsp;cc]]\nThe [[1952 Grand Prix motorcycle racing season|1952 season]] saw the introduction of [[Suspension (motorcycle)|telescopic forks]], full width alloy brake hubs and a sleek fuel tank on the 125 race bike. Power was {{convert|15|bhp|abbr=on}} @ 10800&nbsp;rpm. Britain's [[Cecil Sandford]] piloted the new MV 125 to a [[1952 Isle of Man TT]] victory and went on to win MV Agusta's first [[List of Grand Prix motorcycle racing World champions|world championship]].\n\nWith the success of the 1952 season, independent or \"privateer\" riders could now purchase a \"catalog\" version of the 125 DOHC, now available through the company.  The [[MV Agusta 125 Sohc|Sport Competizione]] racer had many of the same features as the factory bike. These included a multi-plate clutch, gear-driven oil pump, Dell'Orto 27&nbsp;mm SS1 carburetor and remote float chamber. The bike was nicknamed the \"Boy Racer\". In [[1953 Grand Prix motorcycle racing season|1953]], the race engineers adopted the Earles-type forks to help with handling problems on the works racers. The 1953 season saw the introduction of the 350 Four.  MV's racing efforts now included the 500&nbsp;cc, 350&nbsp;cc and 125&nbsp;cc class.\n\nNineteen fifty-three saw the introduction of a new 175&nbsp;cc overhead cam model. MV Agusta produced the 175 CST and CSTL (''Turismo Lusso'') for street use and soon developed a sportier 175&nbsp;cc version with larger carburetor, a larger cylinder head with bigger fins, aluminum wheel rims and plenty of glossy red paint. The first year version (1954) of the 175 Sport featured a beautifully sculpted fuel tank that quickly earned it the unofficial nickname \"Disco Volante\" (''flying saucer'') as, viewed from the front, the tank shape was reminiscent of a flying saucer. Soon after, MV began offering a very limited-availability racing version 175&nbsp;cc \"Super Sport\" for MSDS racing (production club racing) equipped with unusual Earles-design front forks. In 1955, it was superseded by a new and improved Super Sport model with radical new styling and a five-speed gearbox. Its design earned it the nickname \"''Squalo''\" (Shark). This 175&nbsp;cc racing machine was very popular in Britain in the mid-1950s, where tuners learned to bore it out to over 200&nbsp;cc capacity.  Racers including Micheal O\u2019Rourke, [[Derek Minter]], and Bob Keeler raced the 175 and 125 Sport Competizione around Europe with a great deal of success. The marketing strategy of \"race it on Sunday, sell it on Monday\" was adhered to, and it worked. MV street motorcycles enjoyed immense popularity throughout Europe. In 1958 American rider Dave Schuler, riding a borrowed and barely modified MV 175 Sport street bike, won the 175 class at the famed Catalina Island GP off-road race, in California.\n\nAfter the [[1957 Grand Prix motorcycle racing season|1957 season]], the Italian motorcycle manufacturers Gilera, [[Moto Guzzi]] and [[Mondial (motorcycle manufacturer)|Mondial]] jointly agreed to withdraw from Grand Prix competition due to escalating costs and diminishing sales. Count Agusta originally agreed to withdraw, but then had second thoughts. MV Agusta went on to dominate Grand Prix racing, winning 17 consecutive [[List of Grand Prix motorcycle racing World champions|500&nbsp;cc world championships]].<ref name=\"smith 850SS\">{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=Robert|title=Last of the Breed: MV Agusta 850SS|journal=Motorcycle Classics|date=January\u2013February 2013|volume=8|issue=3|url=http://www.motorcycleclassics.com/classic-italian-motorcycles/classic-agusta-motorcycles/mv-agusta-850ss-zm0z13jfzbea.aspx|accessdate=31 January 2013}}</ref>  Count Agusta's competitive nature drove him to hire some of the best riders of the time, including [[Carlo Ubbiali]], [[John Surtees]], [[Mike Hailwood]], [[Giacomo Agostini]], [[Phil Read]], and the best engineers, in particular Arturo Magni. The three- and four-cylinder race bikes were known for their excellent road handling. The fire-engine red racing machines became a hallmark of Grand Prix racing in the 1960s and early 1970s.\n\n=== Loss of the guiding force (1971 - 1980) ===\n\nWith the death of Count Domenico Agusta in 1971, the company lost its guiding force. The company won their last Grand Prix in [[1976 Grand Prix motorcycle racing season|1976]] and by the end of the season they were out of racing.\nThe company's precarious economic position forced MV Agusta to seek out a new financial partner. A solution was found in the form of public financing giant EFIM (''Ente Partecipazioni e Finanziamento Industria Manifatturiera''), which demanded that MV Agusta exit the motorcycle industry if were to have any chance of straightening its finances. However, they continued to sell bikes until 1980, when the last machine in the Cascina Costa warehouses was bought up.\n\n===Spanish production===\nCount Agusta had plans to expand the MV Agusta brand internationally. In post-[[Spanish Civil War|Civil War]] Spain, the [[Francisco Franco|Franco]] regime banned the import of motorcycles and also forbade foreign nationals from settling in Spain, or stating a business there. Brothers Mario and Natale Corando and financiers Enrique Favier and Antonio Sommariva wanted to set up manufacture of MV machines under licence by a local factory, which had licenses and manufacturing permits and therefore have access to raw materials. A deal was struck with Nilo Mas\u00f3 of [[Alpha (motorcycle)|Alpha]] in [[Barcelona]] and [[MV Alpha]] was formed in 1948.<ref name=\"motosantiguasgranada.es.tl\">{{cite web |title=MV Agusta |url=https://motosantiguasgranada.es.tl/MV-Agusta.htm |website=motosantiguasgranada.es.tl |accessdate=17 August 2019 |language=es}}</ref>\n\nSales were good, but because of the limited facilities of Alpha, production could not be increased. The licence to produce MV motorcycles was transferred to the larger and better equipped [[Avello (motorcycle)|Avello]] factory in the Natahoyo neighbourhood of [[Gij\u00f3n]] in [[Asturias]] in 1951, creating the [[MV Avello]] brand.<ref name=\"Fricand\u00f3 motarra\">{{cite web |title=La moto als pa\u00efsos catalans |url=http://frikndomotarra.blogspot.com/2008/10/la-moto-als-pasos-catalans.html |website=Fricand\u00f3 motarra |accessdate=16 August 2019 |language=ca |date=October 2008}}</ref> Production in Spain continued until 1972.<ref name=\"alnorte.webnode.es Puch\">{{cite web |title=La etapa de PUCH - 1970/1984 |url=https://alnorte.webnode.es/la-etapa-de-puch-1970-1984-/ |website=alnorte.webnode.es |accessdate=21 August 2019 |language=es}}</ref>\n\n=== Resurrected by Cagiva (1991 - 1999) ===\n\n[[Image:1998 Oro.JPG|thumb|left|F4 750 Oro]]\n[[Cagiva]] purchased the MV Agusta name trademarks in 1991. In 1997 it introduced the first new MV Agusta motorcycle. The new bikes were four-cylinder 750&nbsp;cc sports machines, [[MV Agusta F4 series|the F4 range]], which included a series of limited production run models, such as the all black paint work SPR model (Special Production Racing) which was featured in the movie ''[[I, Robot (film)|I, Robot]]''. In 2004 they introduced their first 1,000&nbsp;cc bike. 2004 marked the end of production for the 750 Sport machines, with limited production of 300 SR (Special Racing) models in the traditional red and silver livery.\n\nMV Agusta also made a limited number of F4 750&nbsp;cc and F4 1,000&nbsp;cc Senna editions in memory of the late Formula One champion, [[Ayrton Senna]], an avid Ducati and MV Agusta collector, in aid of the Instituto Ayrton Senna, his charity foundation in Brazil for children and young people. Three hundred of each model were made in the early 2000s.\n\nThey also produce a range of 750 and 910 [[naked bike]]s called the [[MV Agusta Brutale series|Brutale]]. Production is limited, as it is the policy of the company to produce an elite machine similar to [[Ferrari]] in motor cars.  They do not compete directly with Japanese manufacturers, whose motorcycles typically sell for considerably lower prices; rather, they compete with other Italian models such as [[Ducati]]'s sports bikes [[Ducati 996|996]], [[Ducati 998|998]], [[Ducati 999|999]], [[Ducati 1098|1098]], and the naked [[Ducati Monster|Monster]]. In 2005 MV Agusta introduced the Tamburini 1000, which is named after its creator, [[Massimo Tamburini]], who had previously worked for Ducati, where he designed the Ducati 916.  ''[[Cycle World]]'' and ''Australian Motorcycle News'' magazine named it the best [[sportbike]] in the world.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} Tamburini designed the Ducati 916 sports bike (predecessor of the 748 and 996 series) which marked the return of Ducati as a successful motorcycle manufacturer in the early twenty-first century. The MV Agusta F4 refined the innovative design of the 916. Claimed power of the new F4 312R model is {{convert|183|hp|abbr=on}}. In 1999 the Cagiva group was restructured for strategic purposes and MV Agusta become the main division, comprising Cagiva and Husqvarna.\n\n===Since 1999===\n\nHeavily in debt, the manufacturer was bought by Malaysian car maker [[Proton (company)|Proton]] in December 2004 for [[Euro|\u20ac]]70 million. In December 2005, Proton sold MV Agusta to GEVI SpA, a [[Genoa]]-based financing company related to Carige, for a token one euro excluding debt. By 2006 GEVI SpA, with 65% of the share capital, had refinanced MV Agusta allowing the company to continue operating in its native Italy.\n\n[[File:MV Agusta F4 2010.jpg|thumb|right|2010 MV Agusta F4 1000]]\nIn July 2007, MV Agusta Motor SpA sold the [[Husqvarna Motorcycles|Husqvarna]] motorcycle brand to [[BMW]] for an undisclosed amount.<ref name=\"hsale\">[http://www.roadracingworld.com/news/article/?article=29685 BMW Buys Husqvarna From MV Agusta] roadracingworld.com retrieved on September 30, 2007</ref> According to MV Agusta president Claudio Castiglioni, the sale was a strategic step to concentrate all of the company's resources in order to expand MV Agusta and [[Cagiva]]'s presence in the international markets, having more financial resources for new model development.<ref name=\"hsale\"/>\n\nFollowing years of stalled ownership, the Guggenheim's \"Art of the Motorcycle\" icon, the F4 model, was ready for a refresh, but the financial status of the company did not allow it.

The modern headquarters and main production facilities are located in [[Varese]], Italy on the shore of [[Lake Varese]].\n\n==History==\n\n=== 1943\u20141945: From idea to mass production ===\n[[File:Agusta AG.1 biplane .jpg|left|thumb|1910 Agusta AG.1 biplane]]\nIt all began in the early years of the 20th century, when [[Count Giovanni Agusta]] left [[Sicily]] for [[northern Italy]], where he built his first aircraft, the AG.1, four years after the [[Wright brothers]] had made history in the US. The First World War, which demonstrated the prospects of aviation, prompted the count to act decisively \u2014 and in 1923, in the town of [[Samarate]], he founded the Costruzioni Aeronautiche Giovanni Agusta S.A. (usually shortened to [[Agusta]]) aircraft factory. However, in 1927, at the age of 48, he dies and leaves his life's work to his wife Giuseppina and sons, [[Domenico Agusta|Domenico]], Vincenzo, Mario and Corrado.\n\nAircraft orders were plentiful, and business generally went well until [[World War II]] intervened. In 1945, following the provisions of the peace treaty after the war, which were later reiterated in the [[Paris Peace Treaties, 1947]], the production of aircraft was forbidden to [[Italy]], and the Agusta family had to think quick to save their high-tech business and keep their employees in work.\n\nIn the midst of [[World War II]] Count [[Domenico Agusta]] came to the idea that the best way to diversify the business and turn it into a peaceful channel would be to create a motorcycle production. Moreover, he understood that a country gutted by war would need a simple, cheap and efficient machine. Therefore, by August 1943, the engine was ready: a 98 cc single-cylinder [[Two-stroke engine|two-stroke]] with two-stage gear box. And even if the total shortage of spare parts had to resort to the services of the black market, the process was already launched \u2014 and on January 19, 1945, in the town of Cascina Costa (near the [[Milan Malpensa Airport|Malpensa airport]] near Milan), a private company Meccanica Verghera S.r.l. was registered, and in the fall of the same year the first motorcycle was presented.\n\nAt a dealership on Via Piatti in [[Milan]] in late October 1945, the press saw a pre-production model of a light motorcycle with a steel tube rigid frame, a [[Motorcycle fork|girder fork]] and 19-inch wheels. The gas tank was marked with large letters M and V. It was called \"Vespa 98\". However Domenico had had to refuse from the spectacular name Vespa ([[English language|English]]: wasp): by that time it was occupied by [[Piaggio]] for its [[Vespa]] [[motorscooter]]. Therefore, in 1946, the motorcycle was put ro mass production as MV 98 and in two versions: Economica (the version presented a year earlier) and Turismo (it was distinguished by the presence of a three-speed gearbox and a rear suspension). The Turismo ([[English language|English]]: tourist) version proved to be so overwhelmingly popular that before long the Economica ([[English language|English]]: economic) version was discontinued. In 1946, about 50 units were produced.\n\n===Racing philosophy (1945\u20131971)===\n\n[[Image:54-mv-175-cstl.jpg|thumb|left|1954 MV Agusta CSTL 175 Turismo Lusso]]\n[[Image:750 America.JPG|thumb|right|750 America]]\n[[Image:Agostini, Giacomo 1976-08-28.jpg|thumb|right|Giacomo Agostini on the MV Agusta 350 four-cylinder]]\nThe brothers had a passion for mechanical workings and for motorcycle racing. Much like [[Enzo Ferrari]], they produced and sold motorcycles almost exclusively to fund their racing efforts. They were determined to have the best [[Grand Prix motorcycle racing]] team in the world and spared no expense on their passion. MV Agusta produced their first prototype, called \"Vespa 98\", in 1945. After learning that the name had already been registered by [[Piaggio]] for its [[Vespa]] [[motorscooter]], it was referred to simply by the number \u201c98\u201d. In 1948, the company built a 125&nbsp;cc [[two-stroke]] single and entered Franco Bertoni in the Italian Grand Prix. Bertoni won the event held in [[Autodromo Nazionale Monza|Monza]] and instantly put the new motorcycle manufacturer on the map.\n\nIn the [[1949 Grand Prix motorcycle racing season|1949 season]], the 125&nbsp;cc, or ultra light weight class, gained new prestige. More motorcycle manufacturers were competing in the inaugural world championships that were held in Switzerland, Netherlands and Italy. The [[Mondial (motorcycle manufacturer)|Mondial]] 125&nbsp;cc DOHC design dominated the 1949 season. The MV riders placed ninth and tenth in the final standings. In 1950, [[Arturo Magni]] and [[Piero Remor]] joined the company after working with [[Gilera]]. Magni was the chief mechanic and Remor was chief designer.<ref>MV Agusta All production road and racing motorcycles. Mick Walker. Osprey Publishing Limited</ref>  The [[1950 Grand Prix motorcycle racing season|1950 season]] and [[1951 Grand Prix motorcycle racing season|1951 season]] were development years, as the company adopted the [[MV Agusta 125 Sohc|125 Dohc]] [[four-stroke]] engine. Racing efforts only produced a fifth-place finish at the [[Dutch TT]] in 1950. The 1951 results were only slightly better.\n[[Image:1951 125cc Racing engine.JPG|thumb|left|MV racing engine 125&nbsp;cc]]\nThe [[1952 Grand Prix motorcycle racing season|1952 season]] saw the introduction of [[Suspension (motorcycle)|telescopic forks]], full width alloy brake hubs and a sleek fuel tank on the 125 race bike. Power was {{convert|15|bhp|abbr=on}} @ 10800&nbsp;rpm. Britain's [[Cecil Sandford]] piloted the new MV 125 to a [[1952 Isle of Man TT]] victory and went on to win MV Agusta's first [[List of Grand Prix motorcycle racing World champions|world championship]].\n\nWith the success of the 1952 season, independent or \"privateer\" riders could now purchase a \"catalog\" version of the 125 DOHC, now available through the company.  The [[MV Agusta 125 Sohc|Sport Competizione]] racer had many of the same features as the factory bike. These included a multi-plate clutch, gear-driven oil pump, Dell'Orto 27&nbsp;mm SS1 carburetor and remote float chamber. The bike was nicknamed the \"Boy Racer\". In [[1953 Grand Prix motorcycle racing season|1953]], the race engineers adopted the Earles-type forks to help with handling problems on the works racers. The 1953 season saw the introduction of the 350 Four.  MV's racing efforts now included the 500&nbsp;cc, 350&nbsp;cc and 125&nbsp;cc class.\n\nNineteen fifty-three saw the introduction of a new 175&nbsp;cc overhead cam model. MV Agusta produced the 175 CST and CSTL (''Turismo Lusso'') for street use and soon developed a sportier 175&nbsp;cc version with larger carburetor, a larger cylinder head with bigger fins, aluminum wheel rims and plenty of glossy red paint. The first year version (1954) of the 175 Sport featured a beautifully sculpted fuel tank that quickly earned it the unofficial nickname \"Disco Volante\" (''flying saucer'') as, viewed from the front, the tank shape was reminiscent of a flying saucer. Soon after, MV began offering a very limited-availability racing version 175&nbsp;cc \"Super Sport\" for MSDS racing (production club racing) equipped with unusual Earles-design front forks. In 1955, it was superseded by a new and improved Super Sport model with radical new styling and a five-speed gearbox. Its design earned it the nickname \"''Squalo''\" (Shark). This 175&nbsp;cc racing machine was very popular in Britain in the mid-1950s, where tuners learned to bore it out to over 200&nbsp;cc capacity.  Racers including Micheal O\u2019Rourke, [[Derek Minter]], and Bob Keeler raced the 175 and 125 Sport Competizione around Europe with a great deal of success. The marketing strategy of \"race it on Sunday, sell it on Monday\" was adhered to, and it worked. MV street motorcycles enjoyed immense popularity throughout Europe. In 1958 American rider Dave Schuler, riding a borrowed and barely modified MV 175 Sport street bike, won the 175 class at the famed Catalina Island GP off-road race, in California.\n\nAfter the [[1957 Grand Prix motorcycle racing season|1957 season]], the Italian motorcycle manufacturers Gilera, [[Moto Guzzi]] and [[Mondial (motorcycle manufacturer)|Mondial]] jointly agreed to withdraw from Grand Prix competition due to escalating costs and diminishing sales. Count Agusta originally agreed to withdraw, but then had second thoughts. MV Agusta went on to dominate Grand Prix racing, winning 17 consecutive [[List of Grand Prix motorcycle racing World champions|500&nbsp;cc world championships]].<ref name=\"smith 850SS\">{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=Robert|title=Last of the Breed: MV Agusta 850SS|journal=Motorcycle Classics|date=January\u2013February 2013|volume=8|issue=3|url=http://www.motorcycleclassics.com/classic-italian-motorcycles/classic-agusta-motorcycles/mv-agusta-850ss-zm0z13jfzbea.aspx|accessdate=31 January 2013}}</ref>  Count Agusta's competitive nature drove him to hire some of the best riders of the time, including [[Carlo Ubbiali]], [[John Surtees]], [[Mike Hailwood]], [[Giacomo Agostini]], [[Phil Read]], and the best engineers, in particular Arturo Magni. The three- and four-cylinder race bikes were known for their excellent road handling. The fire-engine red racing machines became a hallmark of Grand Prix racing in the 1960s and early 1970s.\n\n=== Loss of the guiding force (1971 - 1980) ===\n\nWith the death of Count Domenico Agusta in 1971, the company lost its guiding force. The company won their last Grand Prix in [[1976 Grand Prix motorcycle racing season|1976]] and by the end of the season they were out of racing.\nThe company's precarious economic position forced MV Agusta to seek out a new financial partner. A solution was found in the form of public financing giant EFIM (''Ente Partecipazioni e Finanziamento Industria Manifatturiera''), which demanded that MV Agusta exit the motorcycle industry if were to have any chance of straightening its finances. However, they continued to sell bikes until 1980, when the last machine in the Cascina Costa warehouses was bought up.\n\n===Spanish production===\nCount Agusta had plans to expand the MV Agusta brand internationally. In post-[[Spanish Civil War|Civil War]] Spain, the [[Francisco Franco|Franco]] regime banned the import of motorcycles and also forbade foreign nationals from settling in Spain, or stating a business there. Brothers Mario and Natale Corando and financiers Enrique Favier and Antonio Sommariva wanted to set up manufacture of MV machines under licence by a local factory, which had licenses and manufacturing permits and therefore have access to raw materials. A deal was struck with Nilo Mas\u00f3 of [[Alpha (motorcycle)|Alpha]] in [[Barcelona]] and [[MV Alpha]] was formed in 1948.<ref name=\"motosantiguasgranada.es.tl\">{{cite web |title=MV Agusta |url=https://motosantiguasgranada.es.tl/MV-Agusta.htm |website=motosantiguasgranada.es.tl |accessdate=17 August 2019 |language=es}}</ref>\n\nSales were good, but because of the limited facilities of Alpha, production could not be increased. The licence to produce MV motorcycles was transferred to the larger and better equipped [[Avello (motorcycle)|Avello]] factory in the Natahoyo neighbourhood of [[Gij\u00f3n]] in [[Asturias]] in 1951, creating the [[MV Avello]] brand.<ref name=\"Fricand\u00f3 motarra\">{{cite web |title=La moto als pa\u00efsos catalans |url=http://frikndomotarra.blogspot.com/2008/10/la-moto-als-pasos-catalans.html |website=Fricand\u00f3 motarra |accessdate=16 August 2019 |language=ca |date=October 2008}}</ref> Production in Spain continued until 1972.<ref name=\"alnorte.webnode.es Puch\">{{cite web |title=La etapa de PUCH - 1970/1984 |url=https://alnorte.webnode.es/la-etapa-de-puch-1970-1984-/ |website=alnorte.webnode.es |accessdate=21 August 2019 |language=es}}</ref>\n\n=== Resurrected by Cagiva (1991 - 1999) ===\n\n[[Image:1998 Oro.JPG|thumb|left|F4 750 Oro]]\n[[Cagiva]] purchased the MV Agusta name trademarks in 1991. In 1997 it introduced the first new MV Agusta motorcycle. The new bikes were four-cylinder 750&nbsp;cc sports machines, [[MV Agusta F4 series|the F4 range]], which included a series of limited production run models, such as the all black paint work SPR model (Special Production Racing) which was featured in the movie ''[[I, Robot (film)|I, Robot]]''. In 2004 they introduced their first 1,000&nbsp;cc bike. 2004 marked the end of production for the 750 Sport machines, with limited production of 300 SR (Special Racing) models in the traditional red and silver livery.\n\nMV Agusta also made a limited number of F4 750&nbsp;cc and F4 1,000&nbsp;cc Senna editions in memory of the late Formula One champion, [[Ayrton Senna]], an avid Ducati and MV Agusta collector, in aid of the Instituto Ayrton Senna, his charity foundation in Brazil for children and young people. Three hundred of each model were made in the early 2000s.\n\nThey also produce a range of 750 and 910 [[naked bike]]s called the [[MV Agusta Brutale series|Brutale]]. Production is limited, as it is the policy of the company to produce an elite machine similar to [[Ferrari]] in motor cars.  They do not compete directly with Japanese manufacturers, whose motorcycles typically sell for considerably lower prices; rather, they compete with other Italian models such as [[Ducati]]'s sports bikes [[Ducati 996|996]], [[Ducati 998|998]], [[Ducati 999|999]], [[Ducati 1098|1098]], and the naked [[Ducati Monster|Monster]]. In 2005 MV Agusta introduced the Tamburini 1000, which is named after its creator, [[Massimo Tamburini]], who had previously worked for Ducati, where he designed the Ducati 916.  ''[[Cycle World]]'' and ''Australian Motorcycle News'' magazine named it the best [[sportbike]] in the world.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} Tamburini designed the Ducati 916 sports bike (predecessor of the 748 and 996 series) which marked the return of Ducati as a successful motorcycle manufacturer in the early twenty-first century. The MV Agusta F4 refined the innovative design of the 916. Claimed power of the new F4 312R model is {{convert|183|hp|abbr=on}}. In 1999 the Cagiva group was restructured for strategic purposes and MV Agusta become the main division, comprising Cagiva and Husqvarna.\n\n===Since 1999===\n\nHeavily in debt, the manufacturer was bought by Malaysian car maker [[Proton (company)|Proton]] in December 2004 for [[Euro|\u20ac]]70 million.

Owned by Burrill & Company<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.burrillandco.com/|title=China online Wholesalers on burrillandco.com|website=www.burrillandco.com}}</ref> and the California Healthcare Institute,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://califesciences.org/|title=CLSA|website=California Life Sciences Association}}</ref> TJOLS reports on how developments in the [[life science]]s affect society, business, and policy.\n\nTJOLS was launched to cover topics \u201cwhere science and society meet\u201d\u2014an area that its founders felt was often overlooked by peer-reviewed science journals and mainstream business publications. Printed in a digest format, TJOLS was designed to stand apart from other science magazines on the rack with its edgy illustrated covers and its reliance on photography to help tell stories. The magazine has been well received by biotechnology executives, policy wonks, and healthcare professionals but is working to widen its base beyond its core audience. The number of visitors to tjols.com, which features stories analyzing current life sciences news and trends, has been rising steadily from a small base.\n\nFrom March 2007 to November 2007, TJOLS was published in partnership with Nielsen Business Media.

Printed in a digest format, TJOLS was designed to stand apart from other science magazines on the rack with its edgy illustrated covers and its reliance on photography to help tell stories. The magazine has been well received by biotechnology executives, policy wonks, and healthcare professionals but is working to widen its base beyond its core audience. The number of visitors to tjols.com, which features stories analyzing current life sciences news and trends, has been rising steadily from a small base.\n\nFrom March 2007 to November 2007, TJOLS was published in partnership with Nielsen Business Media.
