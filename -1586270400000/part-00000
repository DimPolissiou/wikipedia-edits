Such a name is called a '''binomial name''' (which may be shortened to just \"binomial\"), a '''binomen''', '''{{not a typo|binominal|reason=This is the alternative name in the ICZN.

For example, humans belong to the genus ''[[Homo]]'' and within this genus to the species ''[[Homo sapiens]]''. ''[[Tyrannosaurus rex]]'' is probably the most widely known binomial.<ref>{{cite book | author=Busby III, Arthur |display-authors=etal | title=A Guide to Rocks and Fossils | page=103 | date=1997}}</ref> The ''formal'' introduction of this system of naming species is credited to [[Carl Linnaeus]], effectively beginning with his work ''[[Species Plantarum]]'' in 1753.<ref name=\"Knapp\" /> But [[Gaspard Bauhin]], in as early as 1622, had introduced in his book ''Pinax theatri botanici'' (English, ''Illustrated exposition of plants'') many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Bauhin|first1=Gaspard|title=Pinax theatri botanici|url=http://edb.kulib.kyoto-u.ac.jp/exhibit-e/b07/b07cont.html|publisher=Kyoto University Library|accessdate=19 June 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe application of binomial nomenclature is now governed by various internationally agreed codes of rules, of which the two most important are the ''[[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature]]'' (''ICZN'') for animals and the ''[[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants]]'' (''ICNafp''). Although the general principles underlying binomial nomenclature are common to these two codes, there are some differences, both in the terminology they use and in their precise rules.\n\nIn modern usage, the first letter of the first part of the name, the genus, is always capitalized in writing, while that of the second part is not, even when derived from a [[proper noun]] such as the name of a person or place. Similarly, both parts are italicized when a binomial name occurs in normal text (or underlined in handwriting). Thus the binomial name of the annual phlox (named after botanist [[Thomas Drummond (botanist)|Thomas Drummond]]) is now written as ''[[Phlox drummondii]]''.\n\nIn scientific works, the [[Binomial nomenclature#Authority|authority]] for a binomial name is usually given, at least when it is first mentioned, and the date of publication may be specified.\n*In [[zoology]]\n** \"''[[Patella vulgata]]'' Linnaeus, 1758\". The name \"Linnaeus\" tells the reader who it was that first published a description and name for this species of limpet; 1758 is the date of the publication in which the original description can be found (in this case the 10th edition of the book ''[[Systema Naturae]]'').\n**\"''[[Passer domesticus]]'' (Linnaeus, 1758)\". The original name given by Linnaeus was ''Fringilla domestica''; the parentheses indicate that the species is now considered to belong in a different genus. The ICZN does not require that the name of the person who changed the genus be given, nor the date on which the change was made, although nomenclatorial catalogs usually include such information.\n*In [[botany]]\n**\"''[[Amaranthus retroflexus]]'' L.\"&nbsp;\u2013 \"L.\" is the standard abbreviation used in botany for \"Linnaeus\".\n**\"''[[Hyacinthoides italica]]'' (L.)

The word \"binomium\" was used in Medieval Latin to signify one of the terms in a two-term binomial expression in mathematics.<ref>See [https://www.cnrtl.fr/definition/bin%C3%B4me entry \"bin\u00f4me\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170606122907/http://www.cnrtl.fr/definition/bin%C3%B4me |date=6 June 2017 }} in le Tr\u00e9sor de la langue fran\u00e7aise informatis\u00e9.</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{see also|Biological classification#Early systems||label 1 = Biological classification: Early systems}}\n\n[[File:Carl von Linn\u00e9.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Carl Linnaeus]] (1707{{ndash}}1778), a Swedish botanist, invented the modern system of binomial nomenclature]]\n\nPrior to the adoption of the modern binomial system of naming species, a scientific name consisted of a generic name combined with a specific name that was from one to several words long.

It can have one of a number of forms:\n* The second part of a binomial may be an adjective. The adjective must agree with the genus name in [[grammatical gender|gender]]. Latin has three genders, masculine, feminine and neuter, shown by varying endings to nouns and adjectives. The [[house sparrow]] has the binomial name ''Passer domesticus''. Here ''domesticus'' (\"domestic\") simply means \"associated with the house\". The [[Nandina|sacred bamboo]] is ''Nandina domestic<u>a</u>''<ref>{{Harvnb|Hyam|Pankhurst|1995|p=334}}</ref> rather than ''Nandina domestic<u>us</u>'', since ''Nandina'' is feminine whereas ''Passer'' is masculine. The tropical fruit [[Lansium parasiticum|langsat]] is a product of the plant ''Lansium parasitic<u>um</u>'', since ''Lansium'' is neuter. Some common endings for Latin adjectives in the three genders (masculine, feminine, neuter) are ''-us'', ''-a'', ''-um'' (as in the previous example of ''domesticus''); ''-is'', ''-is'', ''-e'' (e.g. ''tristis'', meaning \"sad\"); and ''-or'', ''-or'', ''-us'' (e.g. ''minor'', meaning \"smaller\"). For further information, see [[Latin declension#Adjectives|Latin declension: Adjectives]].\n* The second part of a binomial may be a noun in the nominative case. An example is the binomial name of the lion, which is ''Panthera leo''. Grammatically the noun is said to be in [[apposition]] to the genus name and the two nouns do not have to agree in gender; in this case, ''Panthera'' is feminine and ''leo'' is masculine.\n[[File:Talauma hodgsonii.jpg|thumb|''Magnolia hodgsonii'']]\n* The second part of a binomial may be a noun in the [[genitive case|genitive]] (possessive) case. The genitive case is constructed in a number of ways in Latin, depending on the [[Latin declension|declension]] of the noun. Common endings for masculine and neuter nouns are ''-ii'' or ''-i'' in the singular and ''-orum'' in the plural, and for feminine nouns ''-ae'' in the singular and ''-arum'' in the plural. The noun may be part of a person's name, often the surname, as in the [[Tibetan antelope]] (''Pantholops hodgsonii''), the shrub ''[[Magnolia hodgsonii]]'', or the [[olive-backed pipit]] (''Anthus hodgsoni''). The meaning is \"of the person named\", so that ''Magnolia hodgsonii'' means \"Hodgson's magnolia\". The ''-ii'' or ''-i'' endings show that in each case Hodgson was a man (not the same one); had Hodgson been a woman, ''hodgsonae'' would have been used. The person commemorated in the binomial name is not usually (if ever) the person who created the name; for example ''Anthus hodgsoni'' was named by [[Charles Wallace Richmond]], in honour of Hodgson. Rather than a person, the noun may be related to a place, as with ''[[Latimeria chalumnae]]'', meaning \"of the [[Chalumna River]]\". Another use of genitive nouns is in, for example, the name of the bacterium ''[[Escherichia coli]]'', where ''coli'' means \"of the [[colon (anatomy)|colon]]\". This formation is common in parasites, as in ''[[Xenos vesparum]]'', where ''vesparum'' means \"of the wasps\", since ''Xenos vesparum'' is a parasite of wasps.\n\nWhereas the first part of a binomial name must be unique within a kingdom, the second part is quite commonly used in two or more genera (as is shown by examples of ''hodgsonii'' above). The full binomial name must be unique within a kingdom.\n\n==Codes==\n\nFrom the early 19th century<!--Strickland code was 1841--> onwards it became ever more apparent that a body of rules was necessary to govern scientific names.<!--CITATION--> In the course of time these became [[nomenclature codes]]. The ''[[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature]]'' (''ICZN'') governs the naming of animals,<ref name=ICZN>{{Harvnb|International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature|1999}}</ref> the ''[[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants]]'' (''ICNafp'') that of plants (including [[cyanobacteria]]), and the ''[[International Code of Nomenclature of Bacteria]]'' (''ICNB'') that of [[bacteria]] (including [[Archaea]]). [[Virus]] names are governed by the ''[[International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses]]'' (''ICTV''), a taxonomic code, which determines taxa as well as names. These codes differ in certain ways, e.g.:\n* \"Binomial nomenclature\" is the correct term for botany,<ref>[[#ICN2011|McNeill et al. 2011]], Article 23</ref> although it is also used by zoologists.<ref>{{Citation |last=Schmidt |first=Diane |year=2003 |title=Guide to reference and information sources in the zoological sciences |location=Westport, Conn. |publisher=Libraries Unlimited |isbn=978-1-56308-977-0 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/guidetoreference0000schm }}, [//books.google.com/books?id=EqJrbvJU4uwC&pg=PA4 p. 4]</ref> Since 1953, \"binomi<u>n</u>al nomenclature\" is the technically correct term in zoology. A binominal name is also called a binomen (plural binomina).<ref>{{Harvnb|International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature|1999}}, Chap. 2, Article 5</ref>\n* Both codes consider the first part of the two-part name for a species to be the \"generic name\". In the zoological code (''ICZN''), the second part of the name is a \"specific name\". In the botanical code (''ICNafp''), it is a \"specific epithet\". Together, these two parts are referred to as a \"species name\" or \"binomen\" in the zoological code; or \"species name\", \"binomial\", or \"binary combination\" in the botanical code. \"Species name\" is the only term common to the two codes.\n* The ''ICNafp'', the plant code, does not allow the two parts of a binomial name to be the same (such a name is called a [[tautonym]]), whereas the ''ICZN'', the animal code, does. Thus the American bison has the binomial ''Bison bison''; a name of this kind would not be allowed for a plant.\n* The starting points, the time from which these codes are in effect (retroactively), vary from group to group. In [[botany]] the starting point will often be in 1753 (the year Carl Linnaeus first published ''[[Species Plantarum]]''). In [[zoology]] the starting point is 1758 (1 January 1758 is considered the date of the publication of Linnaeus's ''[[Systema Naturae]]'', 10th Edition, and also [[Carl Alexander Clerck|Clerck's]] ''Aranei Svecici''). [[Bacteriology]] started anew, with a starting point on 1 January 1980.<ref>{{Citation |last=Sneath |first=P.H.A. |year=2003 |publisher=International Union of Microbiological Societies |url=http://www.the-icsp.org/misc/Code_history.htm |accessdate=20 June 2013 |title=A short history of the Bacteriological Code |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120524070542/http://www.the-icsp.org/misc/Code_history.htm |archivedate=24 May 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Summary of terminology for the names of species in the ICZN and ICNafp\n!

(There is also a code in development for a different system of classification which does not use ranks, but instead names [[clade]]s. This is called the ''[[PhyloCode]]''.)\n\n===Differences in handling personal names===\nAs noted above, there are some differences between the codes in the way in which binomials can be formed; for example the ''ICZN'' allows both parts to be the same, while the ''ICNafp'' does not. Another difference is in the way in which personal names are used in forming specific names or epithets. The ''ICNafp'' sets out precise rules by which a personal name is to be converted to a specific epithet. In particular, names ending in a consonant (but not \"er\") are treated as first being converted into Latin by adding \"-ius\" (for a man) or \"-ia\" (for a woman), and then being made genitive (i.e. meaning \"of that person or persons\"). This produces specific epithets like ''lecardii'' for Lecard (male), ''wilsoniae'' for Wilson (female), and ''brauniarum'' for the Braun sisters.<ref>[[#ICN2011|McNeill et al. 2011]], Recommendation 60C</ref> By contrast the ''ICZN'' does not require the intermediate creation of a Latin form of a personal name, allowing the genitive ending to added directly to the personal name.<ref>{{Harvnb|International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature|1999}}, Chap. 7, Article 3.1.2</ref> This explains the difference between the names of  the plant ''Magnolia hodgsonii'' and the bird ''Anthus hodgsoni''. Furthermore, the ''ICNafp'' requires names not published in the form required by the code to be corrected to conform to it,<ref>[[#ICN2011|McNeill et al. 2011]], Article 60.12</ref> whereas the ''ICZN'' is more protective of the form used by the original author.<ref>{{Harvnb|International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature|1999}}, Chap. 7, Article 32.3</ref>\n\n== Writing binomial names ==\nBy tradition, the binomial names of species are usually typeset in italics; for example, ''[[Homo sapiens]]''.<ref name=\"howto\">{{Citation |title=How to Write Scientific Names of Organisms |journal=Competition Science Vision |url = http://www.journal.au.edu/au_techno/2001/oct2001/howto.pdf |access-date=20 June 2011 |postscript=. }}</ref> Generally, the binomial should be printed in a [[font|font style]] different from that used in the normal text; for example, \"''Several more ''Homo sapiens'' fossils were discovered''.\" When handwritten, a binomial name should be underlined; for example, <u>Homo sapiens</u>.<ref name=\"tan\">{{citation |url=http://www.cdtl.nus.edu.sg/success/sl43.htm |title=Understanding and Learning Scientific Names of Species |author1=Hugh T.W.

The authority is written in slightly different ways in zoology and botany. For names governed by the ''ICZN'' the surname is usually written in full together with the date (normally only the year) of publication. The ''ICZN'' recommends that the \"original author and date of a name should be cited at least once in each work dealing with the taxon denoted by that name.\"{{sfn|International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature |1999|loc=Recommendation 51a}} For names governed by the ''ICNafp'' the name is generally reduced to a standard abbreviation and the date omitted. The [[International Plant Names Index]] maintains an approved list of botanical author abbreviations. Historically, abbreviations were used in zoology too.\n\nWhen the original name is changed, e.g. the species is moved to a different genus, both codes use parentheses around the original authority; the ''ICNafp'' also requires the person who made the change to be given. In the ''ICNafp'', the original name is then called the [[basionym]]. Some examples:\n*(Plant) ''[[Amaranthus retroflexus]]'' L.&nbsp;\u2013 \"L.\" is the standard abbreviation for \"Linnaeus\"; the absence of parentheses shows that this is his original name.\n*(Plant) ''[[Hyacinthoides italica]]'' (L.) Rothm.&nbsp;\u2013 Linnaeus first named the Italian bluebell ''Scilla italica''; that is the basionym. [[Werner Hugo Paul Rothmaler|Rothmaler]] later transferred it to the genus ''Hyacinthoides''.\n*(Animal) ''[[Passer domesticus]]'' (Linnaeus, 1758)&nbsp;\u2013 the original name given by Linnaeus was ''Fringilla domestica''; unlike the ''ICNafp'', the ''ICZN'' does not require the name of the person who changed the genus to be given.\n\n==Other ranks==\n{{unreferenced section|date=June 2011}}\n{{main|Biological nomenclature|Trinomial nomenclature|Infraspecific name (botany)}}\n\nBinomial nomenclature, as described here, is a system for naming species. Implicitly it includes a system for naming genera, since the first part of the name of the species is a genus name. In a classification system based on ranks there are also ways of naming ranks above the level of genus and below the level of species. Ranks above genus (e.g., family, order, class) receive one-part names, which are conventionally not written in italics. Thus the house sparrow, ''Passer domesticus'', belongs to the family [[Passeridae]]. Family names are normally based on genus names, although the endings used differ between zoology and botany.\n\nRanks below species receive three-part names, conventionally written in italics like the names of species. There are significant differences between the ''ICZN'' and the ''ICNafp''. In zoology, the only rank below species is subspecies and the name is written simply as three parts (a trinomen). Thus one of the subspecies of the [[olive-backed pipit]] is ''Anthus hodgsoni berezowskii''. In botany, there are many ranks below species and although the name itself is written in three parts, a \"connecting term\" (not part of the name) is needed to show the rank. Thus the American black elder is ''Sambucus nigra'' subsp. ''canadensis''; the white-flowered form of the ivy-leaved cyclamen is ''[[Cyclamen hederifolium]]'' f. ''albiflorum''.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Glossary of scientific naming]]\n* [[Botanical name]]\n* [[Hybrid name (botany)]]\n* [[List of botanists by author abbreviation]]\n* [[List of Latin and Greek words commonly used in systematic names]]\n* [[List of zoologists by author abbreviation]]\n* [[Scientific terminology]]\n* [[Species description]]\n* [[Undescribed taxon]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{NoteFoot}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*{{Citation |last=Hyam |first=R. |last2=Pankhurst |first2=R.J. |year=1995 |title=Plants and their names : a concise dictionary |location=Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-866189-4 |lastauthoramp=yes }}\n*{{Citation |last=International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature |year=1999 |title=International Code of Zoological Nomenclature ''online'' |edition=4th |publisher=The International Trust for Zoological Nomenclature |isbn=978-0-85301-006-7 |url = http://www.nhm.ac.uk/hosted-sites/iczn/code/ |accessdate=20 June 2011 }}\n*{{citation |author1=McNeill, J. |author2=Barrie, F.R. |author3=Buck, W.R. |author4=Demoulin, V. |author5=Greuter, W. |author6=Hawksworth, D.L. |author7=Herendeen, P.S. |author8=Knapp, S. |author9=Marhold, K. |author10=Prado, J. |author11=Prud'homme Van Reine, W.F. |author12=Smith, G.F. |author13=Wiersema, J.H. |author14=Turland, N.J. |year=2012 |volume=Regnum Vegetabile 154 |title=International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (Melbourne Code) adopted by the Eighteenth International Botanical Congress Melbourne, Australia, July 2011 |publisher=A.R.G.

Although the general principles underlying binomial nomenclature are common to these two codes, there are some differences, both in the terminology they use and in their precise rules.\n\nIn modern usage, the first letter of the first part of the name, the genus, is always capitalized in writing, while that of the second part is not, even when derived from a [[proper noun]] such as the name of a person or place. Similarly, both parts are italicized when a binomial name occurs in normal text (or underlined in handwriting). Thus the binomial name of the annual phlox (named after botanist [[Thomas Drummond (botanist)|Thomas Drummond]]) is now written as ''[[Phlox drummondii]]''.\n\nIn scientific works, the [[Binomial nomenclature#Authority|authority]] for a binomial name is usually given, at least when it is first mentioned, and the date of publication may be specified.\n*In [[zoology]]\n** \"''[[Patella vulgata]]'' Linnaeus, 1758\".

The original name given by Linnaeus was ''Fringilla domestica''; the parentheses indicate that the species is now considered to belong in a different genus. The ICZN does not require that the name of the person who changed the genus be given, nor the date on which the change was made, although nomenclatorial catalogs usually include such information.\n*In [[botany]]\n**\"''[[Amaranthus retroflexus]]'' L.\"&nbsp;\u2013 \"L.\" is the standard abbreviation used in botany for \"Linnaeus\".\n**\"''[[Hyacinthoides italica]]'' (L.)

It can have one of a number of forms:\n* The second part of a binomial may be an adjective. The adjective must agree with the genus name in [[grammatical gender|gender]]. Latin has three genders, masculine, feminine and neuter, shown by varying endings to nouns and adjectives. The [[house sparrow]] has the binomial name ''Passer domesticus''. Here ''domesticus'' (\"domestic\") simply means \"associated with the house\". The [[Nandina|sacred bamboo]] is ''Nandina domestic<u>a</u>''<ref>{{Harvnb|Hyam|Pankhurst|1995|p=334}}</ref> rather than ''Nandina domestic<u>us</u>'', since ''Nandina'' is feminine whereas ''Passer'' is masculine. The tropical fruit [[Lansium parasiticum|langsat]] is a product of the plant ''Lansium parasitic<u>um</u>'', since ''Lansium'' is neuter. Some common endings for Latin adjectives in the three genders (masculine, feminine, neuter) are ''-us'', ''-a'', ''-um'' (as in the previous example of ''domesticus''); ''-is'', ''-is'', ''-e'' (e.g. ''tristis'', meaning \"sad\"); and ''-or'', ''-or'', ''-us'' (e.g. ''minor'', meaning \"smaller\"). For further information, see [[Latin declension#Adjectives|Latin declension: Adjectives]].\n* The second part of a binomial may be a noun in the nominative case. An example is the binomial name of the lion, which is ''Panthera leo''. Grammatically the noun is said to be in [[apposition]] to the genus name and the two nouns do not have to agree in gender; in this case, ''Panthera'' is feminine and ''leo'' is masculine.\n[[File:Talauma hodgsonii.jpg|thumb|''Magnolia hodgsonii'']]\n* The second part of a binomial may be a noun in the [[genitive case|genitive]] (possessive) case. The genitive case is constructed in a number of ways in Latin, depending on the [[Latin declension|declension]] of the noun. Common endings for masculine and neuter nouns are ''-ii'' or ''-i'' in the singular and ''-orum'' in the plural, and for feminine nouns ''-ae'' in the singular and ''-arum'' in the plural. The noun may be part of a person's name, often the surname, as in the [[Tibetan antelope]] (''Pantholops hodgsonii''), the shrub ''[[Magnolia hodgsonii]]'', or the [[olive-backed pipit]] (''Anthus hodgsoni''). The meaning is \"of the person named\", so that ''Magnolia hodgsonii'' means \"Hodgson's magnolia\". The ''-ii'' or ''-i'' endings show that in each case Hodgson was a man (not the same one); had Hodgson been a woman, ''hodgsonae'' would have been used. The person commemorated in the binomial name is not usually (if ever) the person who created the name; for example ''Anthus hodgsoni'' was named by [[Charles Wallace Richmond]], in honour of Hodgson. Rather than a person, the noun may be related to a place, as with ''[[Latimeria chalumnae]]'', meaning \"of the [[Chalumna River]]\". Another use of genitive nouns is in, for example, the name of the bacterium ''[[Escherichia coli]]'', where ''coli'' means \"of the [[colon (anatomy)|colon]]\". This formation is common in parasites, as in ''[[Xenos vesparum]]'', where ''vesparum'' means \"of the wasps\", since ''Xenos vesparum'' is a parasite of wasps.\n\nWhereas the first part of a binomial name must be unique within a kingdom, the second part is quite commonly used in two or more genera (as is shown by examples of ''hodgsonii'' above). The full binomial name must be unique within a kingdom.\n\n==Codes==\n\nFrom the early 19th century<!--Strickland code was 1841--> onwards it became ever more apparent that a body of rules was necessary to govern scientific names.<!--CITATION--> In the course of time these became [[nomenclature codes]]. The ''[[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature]]'' (''ICZN'') governs the naming of animals,<ref name=ICZN>{{Harvnb|International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature|1999}}</ref> the ''[[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants]]'' (''ICNafp'') that of plants (including [[cyanobacteria]]), and the ''[[International Code of Nomenclature of Bacteria]]'' (''ICNB'') that of [[bacteria]] (including [[Archaea]]). [[Virus]] names are governed by the ''[[International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses]]'' (''ICTV''), a taxonomic code, which determines taxa as well as names. These codes differ in certain ways, e.g.:\n* \"Binomial nomenclature\" is the correct term for botany,<ref>[[#ICN2011|McNeill et al. 2011]], Article 23</ref> although it is also used by zoologists.<ref>{{Citation |last=Schmidt |first=Diane |year=2003 |title=Guide to reference and information sources in the zoological sciences |location=Westport, Conn. |publisher=Libraries Unlimited |isbn=978-1-56308-977-0 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/guidetoreference0000schm }}, [//books.google.com/books?id=EqJrbvJU4uwC&pg=PA4 p. 4]</ref> Since 1953, \"binomi<u>n</u>al nomenclature\" is the technically correct term in zoology. A binominal name is also called a binomen (plural binomina).<ref>{{Harvnb|International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature|1999}}, Chap. 2, Article 5</ref>\n* Both codes consider the first part of the two-part name for a species to be the \"generic name\". In the zoological code (''ICZN''), the second part of the name is a \"specific name\". In the botanical code (''ICNafp''), it is a \"specific epithet\". Together, these two parts are referred to as a \"species name\" or \"binomen\" in the zoological code; or \"species name\", \"binomial\", or \"binary combination\" in the botanical code. \"Species name\" is the only term common to the two codes.\n* The ''ICNafp'', the plant code, does not allow the two parts of a binomial name to be the same (such a name is called a [[tautonym]]), whereas the ''ICZN'', the animal code, does. Thus the American bison has the binomial ''Bison bison''; a name of this kind would not be allowed for a plant.\n* The starting points, the time from which these codes are in effect (retroactively), vary from group to group. In [[botany]] the starting point will often be in 1753 (the year Carl Linnaeus first published ''[[Species Plantarum]]''). In [[zoology]] the starting point is 1758 (1 January 1758 is considered the date of the publication of Linnaeus's ''[[Systema Naturae]]'', 10th Edition, and also [[Carl Alexander Clerck|Clerck's]] ''Aranei Svecici''). [[Bacteriology]] started anew, with a starting point on 1 January 1980.<ref>{{Citation |last=Sneath |first=P.H.A. |year=2003 |publisher=International Union of Microbiological Societies |url=http://www.the-icsp.org/misc/Code_history.htm |accessdate=20 June 2013 |title=A short history of the Bacteriological Code |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120524070542/http://www.the-icsp.org/misc/Code_history.htm |archivedate=24 May 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Summary of terminology for the names of species in the ICZN and ICNafp\n!

(There is also a code in development for a different system of classification which does not use ranks, but instead names [[clade]]s. This is called the ''[[PhyloCode]]''.)\n\n===Differences in handling personal names===\nAs noted above, there are some differences between the codes in the way in which binomials can be formed; for example the ''ICZN'' allows both parts to be the same, while the ''ICNafp'' does not. Another difference is in the way in which personal names are used in forming specific names or epithets. The ''ICNafp'' sets out precise rules by which a personal name is to be converted to a specific epithet. In particular, names ending in a consonant (but not \"er\") are treated as first being converted into Latin by adding \"-ius\" (for a man) or \"-ia\" (for a woman), and then being made genitive (i.e. meaning \"of that person or persons\"). This produces specific epithets like ''lecardii'' for Lecard (male), ''wilsoniae'' for Wilson (female), and ''brauniarum'' for the Braun sisters.<ref>[[#ICN2011|McNeill et al. 2011]], Recommendation 60C</ref> By contrast the ''ICZN'' does not require the intermediate creation of a Latin form of a personal name, allowing the genitive ending to added directly to the personal name.<ref>{{Harvnb|International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature|1999}}, Chap. 7, Article 3.1.2</ref> This explains the difference between the names of  the plant ''Magnolia hodgsonii'' and the bird ''Anthus hodgsoni''. Furthermore, the ''ICNafp'' requires names not published in the form required by the code to be corrected to conform to it,<ref>[[#ICN2011|McNeill et al. 2011]], Article 60.12</ref> whereas the ''ICZN'' is more protective of the form used by the original author.<ref>{{Harvnb|International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature|1999}}, Chap. 7, Article 32.3</ref>\n\n== Writing binomial names ==\nBy tradition, the binomial names of species are usually typeset in italics; for example, ''[[Homo sapiens]]''.<ref name=\"howto\">{{Citation |title=How to Write Scientific Names of Organisms |journal=Competition Science Vision |url = http://www.journal.au.edu/au_techno/2001/oct2001/howto.pdf |access-date=20 June 2011 |postscript=. }}</ref> Generally, the binomial should be printed in a [[font|font style]] different from that used in the normal text; for example, \"''Several more ''Homo sapiens'' fossils were discovered''.\" When handwritten, a binomial name should be underlined; for example, <u>Homo sapiens</u>.<ref name=\"tan\">{{citation |url=http://www.cdtl.nus.edu.sg/success/sl43.htm |title=Understanding and Learning Scientific Names of Species |author1=Hugh T.W.

The somewhat informal use of taxa names with qualifying abbreviations is referred to as [[open nomenclature]] and it is not subject to strict usage codes.\n\nIn some contexts the dagger symbol (\"\u2020\") may be used before or after the binomial name to indicate that the species is extinct.\n\n=== {{anchor|Authority}} Authority ===\n{{main|Author citation (zoology)|Author citation (botany)}}\n\nIn scholarly texts, at least the first or main use of the binomial name is usually followed by the \"authority\"&nbsp;\u2013 a way of designating the scientist(s) who first published the name. The authority is written in slightly different ways in zoology and botany. For names governed by the ''ICZN'' the surname is usually written in full together with the date (normally only the year) of publication. The ''ICZN'' recommends that the \"original author and date of a name should be cited at least once in each work dealing with the taxon denoted by that name.\"{{sfn|International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature |1999|loc=Recommendation 51a}} For names governed by the ''ICNafp'' the name is generally reduced to a standard abbreviation and the date omitted. The [[International Plant Names Index]] maintains an approved list of botanical author abbreviations. Historically, abbreviations were used in zoology too.\n\nWhen the original name is changed, e.g. the species is moved to a different genus, both codes use parentheses around the original authority; the ''ICNafp'' also requires the person who made the change to be given. In the ''ICNafp'', the original name is then called the [[basionym]]. Some examples:\n*(Plant) ''[[Amaranthus retroflexus]]'' L.&nbsp;\u2013 \"L.\" is the standard abbreviation for \"Linnaeus\"; the absence of parentheses shows that this is his original name.\n*(Plant) ''[[Hyacinthoides italica]]'' (L.) Rothm.&nbsp;\u2013 Linnaeus first named the Italian bluebell ''Scilla italica''; that is the basionym. [[Werner Hugo Paul Rothmaler|Rothmaler]] later transferred it to the genus ''Hyacinthoides''.\n*(Animal) ''[[Passer domesticus]]'' (Linnaeus, 1758)&nbsp;\u2013 the original name given by Linnaeus was ''Fringilla domestica''; unlike the ''ICNafp'', the ''ICZN'' does not require the name of the person who changed the genus to be given.\n\n==Other ranks==\n{{unreferenced section|date=June 2011}}\n{{main|Biological nomenclature|Trinomial nomenclature|Infraspecific name (botany)}}\n\nBinomial nomenclature, as described here, is a system for naming species. Implicitly it includes a system for naming genera, since the first part of the name of the species is a genus name. In a classification system based on ranks there are also ways of naming ranks above the level of genus and below the level of species. Ranks above genus (e.g., family, order, class) receive one-part names, which are conventionally not written in italics. Thus the house sparrow, ''Passer domesticus'', belongs to the family [[Passeridae]]. Family names are normally based on genus names, although the endings used differ between zoology and botany.\n\nRanks below species receive three-part names, conventionally written in italics like the names of species. There are significant differences between the ''ICZN'' and the ''ICNafp''. In zoology, the only rank below species is subspecies and the name is written simply as three parts (a trinomen). Thus one of the subspecies of the [[olive-backed pipit]] is ''Anthus hodgsoni berezowskii''. In botany, there are many ranks below species and although the name itself is written in three parts, a \"connecting term\" (not part of the name) is needed to show the rank. Thus the American black elder is ''Sambucus nigra'' subsp. ''canadensis''; the white-flowered form of the ivy-leaved cyclamen is ''[[Cyclamen hederifolium]]'' f. ''albiflorum''.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Glossary of scientific naming]]\n* [[Botanical name]]\n* [[Hybrid name (botany)]]\n* [[List of botanists by author abbreviation]]\n* [[List of Latin and Greek words commonly used in systematic names]]\n* [[List of zoologists by author abbreviation]]\n* [[Scientific terminology]]\n* [[Species description]]\n* [[Undescribed taxon]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{NoteFoot}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*{{Citation |last=Hyam |first=R. |last2=Pankhurst |first2=R.J. |year=1995 |title=Plants and their names : a concise dictionary |location=Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-866189-4 |lastauthoramp=yes }}\n*{{Citation |last=International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature |year=1999 |title=International Code of Zoological Nomenclature ''online'' |edition=4th |publisher=The International Trust for Zoological Nomenclature |isbn=978-0-85301-006-7 |url = http://www.nhm.ac.uk/hosted-sites/iczn/code/ |accessdate=20 June 2011 }}\n*{{citation |author1=McNeill, J. |author2=Barrie, F.R. |author3=Buck, W.R. |author4=Demoulin, V. |author5=Greuter, W. |author6=Hawksworth, D.L. |author7=Herendeen, P.S. |author8=Knapp, S. |author9=Marhold, K. |author10=Prado, J. |author11=Prud'homme Van Reine, W.F. |author12=Smith, G.F. |author13=Wiersema, J.H. |author14=Turland, N.J. |year=2012 |volume=Regnum Vegetabile 154 |title=International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (Melbourne Code) adopted by the Eighteenth International Botanical Congress Melbourne, Australia, July 2011 |publisher=A.R.G.

English ''floor''). Flora itself is the accusative/dative case form of \u201cFlore\u201d ({{lang-non|Fl\u00f3ri}}), from which the names Flor\u00f8 and Florelandet are derived. A common misunderstanding is that the name ''Flor\u00f8'' is the Danish word ''\u00f8'' (\u201cisland\u201d) suffixed to Flora. Although not true, it almost lead to the town being renamed \u201cFlor\u00f8y\u201d in the 1930s.<ref>http://www.flora150.no/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=9:kvifor-heitte-byen-floro&catid=1:historia&Itemid=8</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.floraskulen.no/fagsider/samf_fag/nordre_bergenhus.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-04-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303220937/http://www.floraskulen.no/fagsider/samf_fag/nordre_bergenhus.htm |archive-date=2016-03-03 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===Coat of arms===\nThe [[coat of arms]], originally made for the town of [[Flor\u00f8]], was granted on 19 February 1960.

Then, on 1 January 1866, Bremanger (population: 1,852) became a separate municipality. After the split, Kinn was left with 4,679 inhabitants. On 1 January 1923, the municipality of Kinn was divided into three separate municipalities: the western (island) area was [[Kinn (former municipality)|Kinn]] (population: 2,508); the central (mostly mainland) area was [[Bru, Sogn og Fjordane|Bru]] (population: 1,560); and the southeasternmost inland area was [[Eikefjord]] (population: 929).<ref name=Dag />\n\nDuring the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the [[Schei Committee]].

To the west, it is bordered by the [[North Sea]], to the north it is bordered by [[Bremanger Municipality]], to the east by [[Gloppen Municipality]], and to the south by [[Naustdal Municipality]] and [[Askvoll Municipality]]. Flora includes many islands, including [[Reksta]], [[Askrova]], [[Svan\u00f8ya]], [[Skorpa, Sogn og Fjordane|Skorpa]], [[Fan\u00f8ya]], [[Hovden, Sogn og Fjordane|Hovden]], and [[Kinn (island)|Kinn]]. The municipality also includes the large lakes of [[Endestadvatnet]], Lykkjeb\u00f8vatnet, and Vassetevatnet. The [[Norddalsfjorden (Flora)|Norddalsfjorden]] runs through the northern part of the municipality, and it is crossed by the [[Norddalsfjord Bridge]].\n\n==Attractions==\n\n===Kinn===\nRight out in the sea lies the green, grass-covered island of [[Kinn (island)|Kinn]]. The area around Kinn was the central [[herring]] area in [[Norway]] for the most part of the 19th century. At the height, there lived approximately 15,000 people on Kinn and the surrounding islands in the herring season. Today, there are 15 inhabitants on Kinn.\n\nOn the island of Kinn, on the very edge of the ocean lies the historic [[Kinn Church]] from the 12th century. The church, built in [[Romanesque style]], is the oldest church in the [[Sunnfjord]] region. The church has long been associated with the legend of St. [[Sunniva]]. The [[Choir (architecture)|church choir]] is the oldest part of the church, and the [[lectern]] is the only preserved example of its kind in [[Scandinavia]].\n\nEvery year during the third weekend in June, the Kinna Pageant is an historical [[play (theatre)|play]] about love, hate, fidelity and loyalty to the church and humankind. About 150 actors take part and audiences of several thousand tourists visit the island to watch this beautiful play.<ref name=go />\n\n===Svan\u00f8y===\n[[File:Stav\u00f8y.JPG|thumb|right|View of the island of Svan\u00f8ya]]\n[[Svan\u00f8ya]] is the southernmost and greenest island in the district of Flora. The island was the district's most important trade centre last century, and [[export]]s and shipping were major activities. A stone cross memorial commemorating [[Olaf II of Norway|King Olav the Holy]] and a sacrificial site from the [[Viking age]] can be found here.\n\nThe Svan\u00f8y Estate is an old seat of [[nobility]] from 1685.

The site boasts over 300 carvings depicting both animal and human figures.<ref name=go />\n\n===Coastal Museum===\n[[File:Floroe fra Brandsoeyaasen.jpg|thumb|View of the town of Flor\u00f8]]\nThe [[Coastal Museum in Sogn og Fjordane]] county was established in 1980. The aim was to concentrate on coastal [[nature]] and [[culture]] both past and present. Old boat houses and domestic dwellings were moved from various places in the district and re-erected in [[Flor\u00f8]] near the [[museum]]. It includes many beautiful boats. The 250-year old ''Holmedalsjekta'' (coastal [[Cargo ship|freighter]]) is Norway's oldest non-Viking ship. A large exhibition on [[North Sea oil]], ''Snorreankeret'', based on the [[Snorre oil field|Snorre platform]] is located in the museum.<ref name=go />\n\n===Lighthouses===\n[[File:Stabben lighthouse.jpg|thumb|Stabben lighthouse]]\nThe waters around [[Flor\u00f8]] are dangerous and exposed. Three [[lighthouse]]s were built in the fairways to the town at an early date. Two of them, ''[[Stabben Lighthouse]]'' and ''[[Kvanhovden Lighthouse]]'' are now automated and unmanned.

English ''floor''). Flora itself is the accusative/dative case form of \u201cFlore\u201d ({{lang-non|Fl\u00f3ri}}), from which the names Flor\u00f8 and Florelandet are derived. A common misunderstanding is that the name ''Flor\u00f8'' is the Danish word ''\u00f8'' (\u201cisland\u201d) suffixed to Flora. Although not true, it almost lead to the town being renamed \u201cFlor\u00f8y\u201d in the 1930s.<ref>http://www.flora150.no/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=9:kvifor-heitte-byen-floro&catid=1:historia&Itemid=8</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.floraskulen.no/fagsider/samf_fag/nordre_bergenhus.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-04-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303220937/http://www.floraskulen.no/fagsider/samf_fag/nordre_bergenhus.htm |archive-date=2016-03-03 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===Coat of arms===\nThe [[coat of arms]], originally made for the town of [[Flor\u00f8]], was granted on 19 February 1960.

Then, on 1 January 1866, Bremanger (population: 1,852) became a separate municipality. After the split, Kinn was left with 4,679 inhabitants. On 1 January 1923, the municipality of Kinn was divided into three separate municipalities: the western (island) area was [[Kinn (former municipality)|Kinn]] (population: 2,508); the central (mostly mainland) area was [[Bru, Sogn og Fjordane|Bru]] (population: 1,560); and the southeasternmost inland area was [[Eikefjord]] (population: 929).<ref name=Dag />\n\nDuring the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the [[Schei Committee]].

Flora includes many islands, including [[Reksta]], [[Askrova]], [[Svan\u00f8ya]], [[Skorpa, Sogn og Fjordane|Skorpa]], [[Fan\u00f8ya]], [[Hovden, Sogn og Fjordane|Hovden]], and [[Kinn (island)|Kinn]]. The municipality also includes the large lakes of [[Endestadvatnet]], Lykkjeb\u00f8vatnet, and Vassetevatnet. The [[Norddalsfjorden (Flora)|Norddalsfjorden]] runs through the northern part of the municipality, and it is crossed by the [[Norddalsfjord Bridge]].\n\n==Attractions==\n\n===Kinn===\nRight out in the sea lies the green, grass-covered island of [[Kinn (island)|Kinn]]. The area around Kinn was the central [[herring]] area in [[Norway]] for the most part of the 19th century. At the height, there lived approximately 15,000 people on Kinn and the surrounding islands in the herring season. Today, there are 15 inhabitants on Kinn.\n\nOn the island of Kinn, on the very edge of the ocean lies the historic [[Kinn Church]] from the 12th century. The church, built in [[Romanesque style]], is the oldest church in the [[Sunnfjord]] region. The church has long been associated with the legend of St. [[Sunniva]]. The [[Choir (architecture)|church choir]] is the oldest part of the church, and the [[lectern]] is the only preserved example of its kind in [[Scandinavia]].\n\nEvery year during the third weekend in June, the Kinna Pageant is an historical [[play (theatre)|play]] about love, hate, fidelity and loyalty to the church and humankind. About 150 actors take part and audiences of several thousand tourists visit the island to watch this beautiful play.<ref name=go />\n\n===Svan\u00f8y===\n[[File:Stav\u00f8y.JPG|thumb|right|View of the island of Svan\u00f8ya]]\n[[Svan\u00f8ya]] is the southernmost and greenest island in the district of Flora. The island was the district's most important trade centre last century, and [[export]]s and shipping were major activities. A stone cross memorial commemorating [[Olaf II of Norway|King Olav the Holy]] and a sacrificial site from the [[Viking age]] can be found here.\n\nThe Svan\u00f8y Estate is an old seat of [[nobility]] from 1685. It includes {{convert|62|acre|m2}} of cultivated land and {{convert|30|acre|m2}} of woodland. It has an impressive main building and an old garden full of beautiful trees.<ref name=go />\n\n===Eirikstad Farm===\nThe [[Saga]] says that the [[Viking]] King ''[[Eric Bloodaxe|Eirik Blod\u00f8ks]]'' grew up here, hence the name. Contains a museum with old farming tools. The famous [[Fjord horse]]s are bred and trained here.<ref name=go />\n\n===Batalden Boathouse===\nNorway's westernmost [[art museum|art gallery]] is housed in a restored fishing building. Regular painting and drawing courses are held.<ref name=go />\n\n===Troll Cave===\n''Trollhola,'' a [[prehistory|prehistoric]] [[cave]], is located on the island of [[Askrova]]. The main cavern is the size of a [[cathedral]], has several passages leading from it and it is a fascinating natural phenomenon. The highest point of the island, {{convert|233|m}} above sea level, provides a sweeping view of the [[archipelago]].<ref name=go />\n\n===Rock Carvings===\nIn Ausevika, which is {{convert|41|km}} south of [[Flor\u00f8]], lies one of the largest [[Petroglyph|rock carving]] sites in Norway. There are 3000-year-old carvings here. The site boasts over 300 carvings depicting both animal and human figures.<ref name=go />\n\n===Coastal Museum===\n[[File:Floroe fra Brandsoeyaasen.jpg|thumb|View of the town of Flor\u00f8]]\nThe [[Coastal Museum in Sogn og Fjordane]] county was established in 1980. The aim was to concentrate on coastal [[nature]] and [[culture]] both past and present. Old boat houses and domestic dwellings were moved from various places in the district and re-erected in [[Flor\u00f8]] near the [[museum]]. It includes many beautiful boats. The 250-year old ''Holmedalsjekta'' (coastal [[Cargo ship|freighter]]) is Norway's oldest non-Viking ship. A large exhibition on [[North Sea oil]], ''Snorreankeret'', based on the [[Snorre oil field|Snorre platform]] is located in the museum.<ref name=go />\n\n===Lighthouses===\n[[File:Stabben lighthouse.jpg|thumb|Stabben lighthouse]]\nThe waters around [[Flor\u00f8]] are dangerous and exposed. Three [[lighthouse]]s were built in the fairways to the town at an early date. Two of them, ''[[Stabben Lighthouse]]'' and ''[[Kvanhovden Lighthouse]]'' are now automated and unmanned. The third and largest, ''[[Ytter\u00f8yane Lighthouse]]'', is still manned. There is a lot of shallow areas in the waters west of Flor\u00f8, which makes the coast around Flor\u00f8 ideal for diving most of the year. An abundance of [[shipwreck]]s are located beneath these waters, which attract divers from all over.<ref name=go>{{cite web|url=http://www.gonorway.com/norway/counties/sogn-and-fjordande/flora/7637a9c4347a120/|title=Flora Municipality in Norway|accessdate=10 August 2008}}</ref>\n\n==Sports==\nLocal sport teams include [[Flor\u00f8 TIF]] and [[Flor\u00f8 SK]].\n\n==Notable residents==\n*[[Ivar Lykke Falch Lind]] - Jurist and [[politician]] in Kinn and [[Vevring]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of former municipalities of Norway]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Flora, Norway}}\n*{{wikivoyage-inline|Flor\u00f8}}\n*[http://ssb.no/kommunefakta/flora Municipal fact sheet] from [[Statistics Norway]] {{in lang|no}}\n\n{{Vestland|former}}\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Kinn]]\n[[Category:Flora, Norway| ]]\n[[Category:Former municipalities of Norway]]\n[[Category:1964 establishments in Norway]]\n[[Category:2020 disestablishments in Norway]]\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eMayor:Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: 2015-2019 \u2192 2015\u20132019", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flora,_Norway"}

Each state affiliate has a governing committee, usually consisting of statewide officers elected by state party members and regional representation of one kind or another. Similarly, county, town, city and ward committees, where organized, generally consist of members elected at the local level. State and local committees often coordinate campaign activities within their jurisdiction, oversee local conventions and in some cases primaries or caucuses and may have a role in nominating candidates for elected office under state law.\n\n=== Membership ===\nSince the Libertarian Party's inception, individuals have been able to join the party as voting members by signing their agreement with the organization's [[Libertarian pledge|membership pledge]], which states that the signer does not advocate the initiation of force to achieve political or social goals. During the mid-1980s and into the early 1990s, this membership category was called an \"instant\" membership, but currently, these are referred to as \"signature members\". People joining the party are also asked to pay dues, which are on a sliding scale starting at $25 per year. Lifetime membership is granted with a $1,500 donation in one calendar year. Dues-paying members receive a subscription to the party's national newspaper, ''LP News''.<ref>{{ISSN|8755-1373}}</ref> Since 2006, membership in the party's state affiliates has been separate from membership in the national party,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://lpar.org/help/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120221021341/http://lpar.org/help/|url-status=dead|title=Help the LPAR \u00ab Libertarian Party of Arkansas|archivedate=February 21, 2012}}</ref> with each state chapter maintaining its own membership rolls.\n\nMost rights to participate in the governance of the party are limited to \"bylaws-sustaining members\" who have either purchased a lifetime membership or donated at least $25 within the past year. Most state parties maintain separate membership, which may be tied to either payment of dues to the state party, or voter registration as a Libertarian, depending on the state's election laws.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lp.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/2016_LP_Bylaws_and_Convention_Rules_w_2016_JC_Rules.pdf|title=Bylaws|date=2016|website=lp.org}}</ref>\n\n== Platform ==\n{{Duplication|section=yes|dupe=#Political positions|date=September 2019}}\nThe preamble outlines the party's goals: \"As Libertarians, we seek a world of liberty; a world in which all individuals are sovereign over their own lives and no one is forced to sacrifice his or her values for the benefit of others. [...] Our goal is nothing more nor less than a world set free in our lifetime, and it is to this end that we take these stands\". Its Statement of Principles begins: \"We, the members of the Libertarian Party, challenge the cult of the omnipotent state and defend the rights of the individual\". The Statement of Principles is foundational to the ideology of the party and was created specifically to bind the party to certain core principles with a high parliamentary burden for any amendment.<ref>{{cite web |last = Ann |first = Caryn |url = http://www.independentpoliticalreport.com/2015/09/d-frank-robinson-the-libertarian-party-statement-of-principles/ |title = D.

The party opposes [[gun control]]. It calls for [[United States Constitution|Constitutional]] limitations on government as well as the elimination of most state functions. It includes a \"Self-determination\" section which quotes from the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] and reads: \"Whenever any form of government becomes destructive of individual liberty, it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it, and to agree to such new governance as to them shall seem most likely to protect their liberty\". It also includes an \"Omissions\" section which reads: \"Our silence about any other particular government law, regulation, ordinance, directive, edict, control, regulatory agency, activity, or machination should not be construed to imply approval\".<ref name=platform/>\n\nThe party favors minimally regulated markets, a less powerful [[federal government]], strong [[civil liberties]] (including [[LGBT rights]], with the party supporting [[same-sex marriage]]), the [[drug liberalization|liberalization of drug laws]], [[separation of church and state]], [[open immigration]], [[non-interventionism]] and [[neutrality (international relations)|neutrality]] in diplomatic relations, [[free trade]] and [[freedom of movement|free movement]] to all foreign countries and a more representative republic.<ref name=platform>{{cite web |url = http://www.lp.org/platform |title= Libertarian Party: Platform |publisher = Libertarian Party |access-date = June 6, 2012 }}</ref> The party's position on abortion is that government should stay out of the matter and leave it to the individual, but recognizes that some \"good-faith\" opinions on this issue are different.<ref name=\"abortion1.4\">{{cite web |work = Platform |url = http://www.lp.org/platform |title = 1.4 Abortion |publisher = Libertarian Party |access-date = March 8, 2013 }}</ref> [[Ron Paul]], one of the former presidential nominees of the Libertarian Party in 1988, is strictly [[anti-abortion]].

The precise language of this statement is found in the party Bylaws.<ref>[http://www.lp.org/organization/bylaws.shtml Official Bylaws] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080605025750/http://www.lp.org/organization/bylaws.shtml |date=June 5, 2008 }} of the Libertarian Party.

Since its founding, the party has apportioned delegate seats to its national convention based on the number of members in each state who have paid minimum dues (with additional delegates given to state affiliates for good performance in winning more votes than normal for the party's presidential candidate). This is the most-used number by party activists. As of December 2017, the Libertarian Party reported that there were 14,445 donating members.<ref name=\"hq.lp.org\"/>\n\nHistorically, dues were $15 throughout the 1980s and in 1991 they were increased to $25. Between February 1, 2006, and the close of the 2006 Libertarian party convention on May 31, 2006, dues were set to $0.<ref name=\"LNC Approves Zero Dues\">\"[http://www.lp.org/lpnews/article_769.shtml LNC Approves Zero Dues]\", ''LP News'', September 1, 2005.

After that, [[Mark B. Madsen]], a Utah State Senator, switched from the Republican Party to the Libertarian Party. From February to June 2017, three New Hampshire State Representatives ([[Caleb Q. Dyer]], [[Joseph Stallcop]] and [[Brandon Phinney]]) left the Republican and Democratic Parties and joined the Libertarian Party. In January 2018, [[New Mexico Commissioner of Public Lands]] [[Aubrey Dunn Jr.]] switched his party registration from Republican to Libertarian and subsequently announced he would run as the Libertarian nominee for the [[United States Senate election in New Mexico, 2018|Senate election in New Mexico]]. Dunn is the first Libertarian in a statewide office and as a result is the highest public official from the Libertarian Party.\n\n== Presidential ballot access ==\nThe Libertarian Party has placed a presidential candidate on the ballot in all 50 states, as well as D. C., five times. That level of ballot access has only been achieved by a third-party candidate four other times ([[John B. Anderson|John Anderson]] in 1980, [[Lenora Fulani]] in 1988, and [[Ross Perot]] in 1992 and 1996.) Although the territory of [[Guam]] has no electoral votes, it began holding presidential elections in 1980. The Libertarian Party presidential candidate appeared on the ballot in Guam in every election from 1980 through 2012. Anderson and Fulani were also on the ballot in Guam.<ref>{{cite web|author=Guam Election Commission|url=https://gec.guam.gov/index.php/about-the-gec/reports-studies-publications|title=Reports, Studies & Publications|publisher=Gec.guam.gov|accessdate=June 21, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe following is a table comparison of ballot status for the Libertarian Party presidential nominee from 1972 to 2016.

Libertarians have expressed that parents should have control of and responsibility for all funds expended for their children's education.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web |url = http://www.lp.org/platform |title = Platform|publisher = Libertarian Party |access-date = January 29, 2016 }}</ref>\n\n==== Environment ====\n{{see also|Free-market environmentalism}}\nThe Libertarian Party supports a clean and healthy environment and sensible use of [[natural resources]], believing that private landowners and conservation groups have a vested interest in maintaining such natural resources.<ref name=platform /> The party has also expressed that \"governments, unlike private businesses, are unaccountable for such damage done to the environment and have a terrible track record when it comes to environmental protection\".<ref name=\"Platform\">{{cite web |url = http://www.lp.org/platform |title = Platform|publisher = Libertarian Party |access-date = May 5, 2015 }}</ref> The party contends that the environment is best protected when individual rights pertaining to natural resources are clearly defined and enforced. The party also contends that [[free market]]s and [[Property rights (economics)|property rights]] (implicitly without government intervention) will stimulate the technological innovations and behavioral changes required to protect the environment and ecosystem because environmental advocates and [[social pressure]] are the most effective means of changing public behavior.<ref name=\"Platform\"/>\n\n==== Fiscal policies ====\nThe Libertarian Party opposes all government intervention and regulation on wages, [[price]]s, [[Renting|rents]], [[Profit (accounting)|profits]], production and [[interest rate]]s and advocate the repeal of all laws banning or restricting the advertising of [[price]]s, products, or services. The party's recent platform calls for the repeal of the [[income tax]], the abolition of the [[Internal Revenue Service]] and all federal programs and services, such as the [[Federal Reserve System]]. The party supports the passage of a [[Balanced Budget Amendment]] to the Constitution which they believe will significantly lower the [[National debt of the United States|national debt]], provided that the budget is balanced preferably by cutting expenditures and not by raising taxes. Libertarians favor free-market banking, with unrestricted competition among banks and depository institutions of all types. The party also wants a halt to [[inflationary]] monetary policies and legal tender laws. While the party defends the right of individuals to form corporations, cooperatives and other types of companies, it opposes government [[subsidies]] to business, labor, or any other [[special interest]].<ref name=\"Platform\" />\n\n==== Healthcare ====\nThe Libertarian Party favors a [[Free-market healthcare|free market health care]] system without government oversight, approval, regulation, or licensing. The party states that it \"recognizes the freedom of individuals to determine the level of [[health insurance]] they can afford (if any), the amount of health care they can afford, the care providers they can afford, the medicines and treatments they can use and all other aspects of their [[medical care]], including the many end-of-life decisions that will follow\". They support the repeal of all social insurance policies such as [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] and [[Medicaid]] and favor \"consumer-driven health care\".<ref>{{cite press release |url = https://www.lp.org/news/press-releases/libertarian-party-opposes-health-care-plan |date = March 19, 2010 |title = Libertarian Party opposes health care plan |publisher = Libertarian Party |access-date = August 2, 2016 }}</ref> The Libertarian Party has been advocating for Americans' ability to purchase health insurance across state lines.\n\n==== Immigration and trade agreements ====\nThe Libertarian Party consistently lobbies for the removal of governmental impediments to free trade.

The party supports the right of free persons to associate or not associate in [[Trade union|labor unions]] and believes that employers should have the right to recognize or refuse to recognize a union.<ref name=\"Platform\"/>\n\n==== Retirement and Social Security ====\nThe party believes that retirement planning is the responsibility of the individual, not the government. Libertarians would phase out the current government-sponsored [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] system and transition to a [[Privatization|private]] voluntary system. The Libertarians feel that the proper and most effective source of help for the poor is the voluntary efforts of [[Charitable organization|private groups]] and individuals, believing members of society will become more charitable and civil society will be strengthened as government reduces its activity in that realm.<ref name=\"Platform\" />\n\n=== Social issues ===\nThe Libertarian Party supports the legalization of all [[victimless crimes]],<ref name=\"http://www.lp.org/platform\">{{cite web|url=http://www.lp.org/platform|title=Platform &#124; Libertarian Party|publisher=Libertarian Party|date=|accessdate=January 29, 2016}}</ref> including [[Recreational drug use|drugs]],<ref name=\"Eagles Johnston\">{{cite book|title=Politics: An Introduction to Modern Democratic Government|last1=Eagles|first1=Munroe|last2=Johnston|first2=Larry|year=2008|publisher=[[University of Toronto Press]]|isbn=978-1-55111-858-1|page=110|url=https://books.google.com/?id=uw9BHYRdtsAC&pg=PA110}}</ref><ref name=\"Libertarian struggle\">{{cite news|first=Karin|last=Miller|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=uOwjAAAAIBAJ&sjid=xewDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6583,6407110&dq=prostitution+libertarian-party&hl=en|title=Libertarian struggle to be taken seriously in presidential race|work=[[Deseret News]]|agency=Associated Press|date=September 12\u201313, 1996}}</ref><ref name=\"Co-founder\">{{cite news|first=Emma|last=Brown|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/11/23/AR2010112306604.html|title=Co-founder of national Libertarian Party|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=November 24, 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"GALLOWAY Libertarian\">{{cite news|first=Angela|last=Galloway|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/default/article/For-Libertarians-winning-is-a-work-in-progress-1155744.php |title = For Libertarians, winning is a work in progress|work=[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]|date=October 3, 2004}}</ref> [[Libertarian Party (United States)#Pornography|pornography]],<ref name=\"Eagles Johnston\"/> [[Libertarian Party (United States)#Prostitution|prostitution]],<ref name=\"Eagles Johnston\"/><ref name=\"Libertarian struggle\"/><ref name=\"Co-founder\"/><ref name=\"GALLOWAY Libertarian\"/> [[polygamy]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.azlp.org/platform.php|publisher=Arizona Libertarian Party|title=Home|accessdate=May 5, 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150503140844/http://www.azlp.org/platform.php|archivedate=May 3, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref> and [[gambling]],<ref>{{cite book|title=Understanding American Government and Politics|first=Duncan|last=Watts|year=2006|publisher=[[Manchester University Press]]|isbn=978-0-7190-7327-4|page=246|url=https://books.google.com/?id=SIeIARfRc1AC&pg=RA2-PT124}}</ref> supports the removal of restrictions on [[Libertarian Party (United States)#LGBT issues|homosexuality]],<ref name=\"Co-founder\"/> opposes any kind of [[censorship]] and supports [[freedom of speech]],<ref name=\"Freedom of Speech\">{{cite web|url=http://www.lp.org/issues/freedom-of-speech|title=Freedom of Speech|publisher=Libertarian Party|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514110414/http://www.lp.org/issues/freedom-of-speech|archivedate=May 14, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref> and supports the [[right to keep and bear arms]]<ref name=\"Libertarian struggle\"/> while opposing Federal capital punishment.<ref name=\"ontheissues.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ontheissues.org/Celeb/Libertarian_Party_Crime.htm|title=Libertarian Party on Crime|work=OnTheIssues.org|date=|accessdate=January 29, 2016}}</ref> The Libertarian Party's platform states: \"Government does not have the authority to define, license or restrict [[personal relationship]]s.

Some, like the group [[Libertarians for Life]], consider abortion to be an act of aggression from the government or mother against a fetus. Others, like the group Pro-Choice Libertarians, consider denying a woman the right to choose abortion to be an act of aggression from the government against her.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pro-choicelibertarians.net/|title=Pro-Choice Libertarians|accessdate=July 12, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==== Crime and capital punishment ====\n{{see also|Libertarian perspectives on capital punishment}}\nShortly before the [[2000 United States presidential election|2000 elections]], the party released a \"Libertarian Party Program on Crime\" in which they criticize the failures of a recently proposed Omnibus Crime Bill, especially detailing how it expands the list of [[capital crime]]s.<ref name=\"ontheissues.org\"/> Denouncing Federal executions, they also describe how the party would increase and safeguard the [[rights of the accused]] in legal settings as well as limit the use of [[excessive force]] by police.

The party describes the issue in its website: \"We defend the rights of individuals to unrestricted freedom of speech, [[freedom of the press]] and the right of individuals to [[dissent]] from government itself. [...] We oppose any abridgment of the freedom of speech through government censorship, regulation or control of communications media\". The party claims it is the only political party in the United States \"with an explicit stand against censorship of computer communications in its platform\".<ref name=\"Freedom of Speech\"/>\n\n==== Government reform ====\nThe Libertarian Party favors election systems that are more representative of the [[Electoral district|electorate]] at the [[United States federal government|federal]], state and [[local government|local]] levels. The party platform calls for an end to any tax-financed subsidies to candidates or parties and the repeal of all laws which restrict voluntary financing of election campaigns. As a [[minor party]], it opposes laws that effectively exclude alternative candidates and parties, deny [[ballot access]], [[gerrymander]] districts, or deny the voters their right to consider all legitimate alternatives. Libertarians also promote the use of [[direct democracy]] through the [[referendum]] and [[recall election|recall]] processes.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\n==== LGBT issues ====\nThe Libertarian Party advocates repealing all laws that control or prohibit homosexuality.<ref name=calp>{{Cite web|url=http://ca.lp.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Platform-of-the-Libertarian-Party-of-California-as-amended-in-Convention-March-3-2012.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403014848/http://ca.lp.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Platform-of-the-Libertarian-Party-of-California-as-amended-in-Convention-March-3-2012.pdf|url-status=dead|title=Platform of the Libertarian Party of California as amended in Convention March 3, 2012|archivedate=April 3, 2015}}</ref> According to the Libertarian Party's platform: \"Sexual orientation, preference, gender, or gender identity should have no impact on the government's treatment of individuals, such as in current marriage, child custody, adoption, immigration or military service laws\".<ref name=Platform/>\n\nGay activist Richard Sincere has pointed to the longstanding support of gay rights by the party, which has supported [[same-sex marriage]] since its first platform was drafted in 1972 (40 years before the Democratic Party adopted same-sex marriage into their platform in 2012).

The proposal was incorporated in a new party-wide strategic plan and a joint platform-program committee proposed a reformatted project platform that isolated talking points on issues, principles and solutions as well as an array of projects for adaptation. This platform, along with a short Summary for talking points, was approved in 2004. Confusion arose when prior to the 2006 convention there was a push to repeal or substantially rewrite the Platform, at the center of which were groups such as the Libertarian Reform Caucus.<ref>\"[http://www.reformthelp.org/  Victory in Portland! Libertarian Reform Caucus]\"</ref> Their agenda was partially successful in that the current platform was much shortened (going from 61 to 15 planks&nbsp;\u2013 11 new planks and 4 retained from the old platform) over the previous one.<ref name=\"platform2006\">[http://www.lp.org/issues/platform_all.shtml National Platform of the Libertarian Party] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080528182629/http://www.lp.org/issues/platform_all.shtml |date=May 28, 2008 }}, Official Website of the Libertarian National Committee.

Some delegates voted for changes so the party could appeal to a wider audience, while others simply thought the entire document needed an overhaul. It was also pointed out that the text of the existing platform was not provided to the delegates, making many reluctant to vote to retain the planks when the existing language was not provided for review.<ref>\"[http://www.libertyforall.net/?p=6 Portland and the LP Platform: The Perfect Storm] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312201243/http://www.libertyforall.net/?p=6 |date=March 12, 2007 }}\", a review by George Squyres, Platform Committee chairman.

Each state affiliate has a governing committee, usually consisting of statewide officers elected by state party members and regional representation of one kind or another. Similarly, county, town, city and ward committees, where organized, generally consist of members elected at the local level. State and local committees often coordinate campaign activities within their jurisdiction, oversee local conventions and in some cases primaries or caucuses and may have a role in nominating candidates for elected office under state law.\n\n=== Membership ===\nSince the Libertarian Party's inception, individuals have been able to join the party as voting members by signing their agreement with the organization's [[Libertarian pledge|membership pledge]], which states that the signer does not advocate the initiation of force to achieve political or social goals. During the mid-1980s and into the early 1990s, this membership category was called an \"instant\" membership, but currently, these are referred to as \"signature members\". People joining the party are also asked to pay dues, which are on a sliding scale starting at $25 per year. Lifetime membership is granted with a $1,500 donation in one calendar year. Dues-paying members receive a subscription to the party's national newspaper, ''LP News''.<ref>{{ISSN|8755-1373}}</ref> Since 2006, membership in the party's state affiliates has been separate from membership in the national party,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://lpar.org/help/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120221021341/http://lpar.org/help/|url-status=dead|title=Help the LPAR \u00ab Libertarian Party of Arkansas|archivedate=February 21, 2012}}</ref> with each state chapter maintaining its own membership rolls.\n\nMost rights to participate in the governance of the party are limited to \"bylaws-sustaining members\" who have either purchased a lifetime membership or donated at least $25 within the past year. Most state parties maintain separate membership, which may be tied to either payment of dues to the state party, or voter registration as a Libertarian, depending on the state's election laws.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lp.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/2016_LP_Bylaws_and_Convention_Rules_w_2016_JC_Rules.pdf|title=Bylaws|date=2016|website=lp.org}}</ref>\n\n== Platform ==\n{{Duplication|section=yes|dupe=#Political positions|date=September 2019}}\nThe preamble outlines the party's goals: \"As Libertarians, we seek a world of liberty; a world in which all individuals are sovereign over their own lives and no one is forced to sacrifice his or her values for the benefit of others. [...] Our goal is nothing more nor less than a world set free in our lifetime, and it is to this end that we take these stands\". Its Statement of Principles begins: \"We, the members of the Libertarian Party, challenge the cult of the omnipotent state and defend the rights of the individual\". The Statement of Principles is foundational to the ideology of the party and was created specifically to bind the party to certain core principles with a high parliamentary burden for any amendment.<ref>{{cite web |last = Ann |first = Caryn |url = http://www.independentpoliticalreport.com/2015/09/d-frank-robinson-the-libertarian-party-statement-of-principles/ |title = D.

The party opposes [[gun control]]. It calls for [[United States Constitution|Constitutional]] limitations on government as well as the elimination of most state functions. It includes a \"Self-determination\" section which quotes from the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] and reads: \"Whenever any form of government becomes destructive of individual liberty, it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it, and to agree to such new governance as to them shall seem most likely to protect their liberty\". It also includes an \"Omissions\" section which reads: \"Our silence about any other particular government law, regulation, ordinance, directive, edict, control, regulatory agency, activity, or machination should not be construed to imply approval\".<ref name=platform/>\n\nThe party favors minimally regulated markets, a less powerful [[federal government]], strong [[civil liberties]] (including [[LGBT rights]], with the party supporting [[same-sex marriage]]), the [[drug liberalization|liberalization of drug laws]], [[separation of church and state]], [[open immigration]], [[non-interventionism]] and [[neutrality (international relations)|neutrality]] in diplomatic relations, [[free trade]] and [[freedom of movement|free movement]] to all foreign countries and a more representative republic.<ref name=platform>{{cite web |url = http://www.lp.org/platform |title= Libertarian Party: Platform |publisher = Libertarian Party |access-date = June 6, 2012 }}</ref> The party's position on abortion is that government should stay out of the matter and leave it to the individual, but recognizes that some \"good-faith\" opinions on this issue are different.<ref name=\"abortion1.4\">{{cite web |work = Platform |url = http://www.lp.org/platform |title = 1.4 Abortion |publisher = Libertarian Party |access-date = March 8, 2013 }}</ref> [[Ron Paul]], one of the former presidential nominees of the Libertarian Party in 1988, is strictly [[anti-abortion]].

The precise language of this statement is found in the party Bylaws.<ref>[http://www.lp.org/organization/bylaws.shtml Official Bylaws] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080605025750/http://www.lp.org/organization/bylaws.shtml |date=June 5, 2008 }} of the Libertarian Party.

Since its founding, the party has apportioned delegate seats to its national convention based on the number of members in each state who have paid minimum dues (with additional delegates given to state affiliates for good performance in winning more votes than normal for the party's presidential candidate). This is the most-used number by party activists. As of December 2017, the Libertarian Party reported that there were 14,445 donating members.<ref name=\"hq.lp.org\"/>\n\nHistorically, dues were $15 throughout the 1980s and in 1991 they were increased to $25. Between February 1, 2006, and the close of the 2006 Libertarian party convention on May 31, 2006, dues were set to $0.<ref name=\"LNC Approves Zero Dues\">\"[http://www.lp.org/lpnews/article_769.shtml LNC Approves Zero Dues]\", ''LP News'', September 1, 2005.

Since the party's creation, 10 Libertarians have been elected to [[State legislature (United States)|state legislatures]] and some other state legislators have switched parties after being originally elected as Republicans or Democrats. The most recent Libertarian candidate elected to a state legislature was [[Steve Vaillancourt]] to the [[New Hampshire House of Representatives]] in 2000.

The first to do so was [[John Moore (Nevada politician)|John Moore]], a then-sitting Assemblyman in Nevada.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.lp.org/news/press-releases/nevada-state-assemblyman-john-moore-joins-libertarian-party|title=Nevada State Assemblyman John Moore Joins Libertarian Party|website=Libertarian Party|accessdate=May 12, 2016|date=January 8, 2016}}</ref> Following the 2016 Nebraska State Legislative Session, state Senator [[Laura Ebke]] announced her displeasure with the Republican Party and announced she was registering as a Libertarian. After that, [[Mark B. Madsen]], a Utah State Senator, switched from the Republican Party to the Libertarian Party. From February to June 2017, three New Hampshire State Representatives ([[Caleb Q. Dyer]], [[Joseph Stallcop]] and [[Brandon Phinney]]) left the Republican and Democratic Parties and joined the Libertarian Party. In January 2018, [[New Mexico Commissioner of Public Lands]] [[Aubrey Dunn Jr.]] switched his party registration from Republican to Libertarian and subsequently announced he would run as the Libertarian nominee for the [[United States Senate election in New Mexico, 2018|Senate election in New Mexico]]. Dunn is the first Libertarian in a statewide office and as a result is the highest public official from the Libertarian Party.\n\n== Presidential ballot access ==\nThe Libertarian Party has placed a presidential candidate on the ballot in all 50 states, as well as D. C., five times. That level of ballot access has only been achieved by a third-party candidate four other times ([[John B. Anderson|John Anderson]] in 1980, [[Lenora Fulani]] in 1988, and [[Ross Perot]] in 1992 and 1996.) Although the territory of [[Guam]] has no electoral votes, it began holding presidential elections in 1980. The Libertarian Party presidential candidate appeared on the ballot in Guam in every election from 1980 through 2012. Anderson and Fulani were also on the ballot in Guam.<ref>{{cite web|author=Guam Election Commission|url=https://gec.guam.gov/index.php/about-the-gec/reports-studies-publications|title=Reports, Studies & Publications|publisher=Gec.guam.gov|accessdate=June 21, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe following is a table comparison of ballot status for the Libertarian Party presidential nominee from 1972 to 2016.

It adopts pro-[[civil liberties]] and pro-[[cultural liberalism|cultural liberal]] approaches to cultural and social issues. Paul H.

The party's recent platform calls for the repeal of the [[income tax]], the abolition of the [[Internal Revenue Service]] and all federal programs and services, such as the [[Federal Reserve System]]. The party supports the passage of a [[Balanced Budget Amendment]] to the Constitution which they believe will significantly lower the [[National debt of the United States|national debt]], provided that the budget is balanced preferably by cutting expenditures and not by raising taxes. Libertarians favor free-market banking, with unrestricted competition among banks and depository institutions of all types.

Libertarians would phase out the current government-sponsored [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] system and transition to a [[Privatization|private]] voluntary system.

The party claims it is the only political party in the United States \"with an explicit stand against censorship of computer communications in its platform\".<ref name=\"Freedom of Speech\"/>\n\n==== Government reform ====\nThe Libertarian Party favors election systems that are more representative of the [[Electoral district|electorate]] at the [[United States federal government|federal]], state and [[local government|local]] levels. The party platform calls for an end to any tax-financed subsidies to candidates or parties and the repeal of all laws which restrict voluntary financing of election campaigns. As a [[minor party]], it opposes laws that effectively exclude alternative candidates and parties, deny [[ballot access]], [[gerrymander]] districts, or deny the voters their right to consider all legitimate alternatives. Libertarians also promote the use of [[direct democracy]] through the [[referendum]] and [[recall election|recall]] processes.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\n==== LGBT issues ====\nThe Libertarian Party advocates repealing all laws that control or prohibit homosexuality.<ref name=calp>{{Cite web|url=http://ca.lp.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Platform-of-the-Libertarian-Party-of-California-as-amended-in-Convention-March-3-2012.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403014848/http://ca.lp.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Platform-of-the-Libertarian-Party-of-California-as-amended-in-Convention-March-3-2012.pdf|url-status=dead|title=Platform of the Libertarian Party of California as amended in Convention March 3, 2012|archivedate=April 3, 2015}}</ref> According to the Libertarian Party's platform: \"Sexual orientation, preference, gender, or gender identity should have no impact on the government's treatment of individuals, such as in current marriage, child custody, adoption, immigration or military service laws\".<ref name=Platform/>\n\nGay activist Richard Sincere has pointed to the longstanding support of gay rights by the party, which has supported [[same-sex marriage]] since its first platform was drafted in 1972 (40 years before the Democratic Party adopted same-sex marriage into their platform in 2012).

The proposal was incorporated in a new party-wide strategic plan and a joint platform-program committee proposed a reformatted project platform that isolated talking points on issues, principles and solutions as well as an array of projects for adaptation. This platform, along with a short Summary for talking points, was approved in 2004. Confusion arose when prior to the 2006 convention there was a push to repeal or substantially rewrite the Platform, at the center of which were groups such as the Libertarian Reform Caucus.<ref>\"[http://www.reformthelp.org/  Victory in Portland!

Some delegates voted for changes so the party could appeal to a wider audience, while others simply thought the entire document needed an overhaul. It was also pointed out that the text of the existing platform was not provided to the delegates, making many reluctant to vote to retain the planks when the existing language was not provided for review.<ref>\"[http://www.libertyforall.net/?p=6 Portland and the LP Platform: The Perfect Storm] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312201243/http://www.libertyforall.net/?p=6 |date=March 12, 2007 }}\", a review by George Squyres, Platform Committee chairman.

Evidence has been found that the Laurel, Arvilla, St. Croix, and Blackduck complexes were the area's early occupants. Approximately 400 years ago, the [[Cree]], [[Assiniboine people|Assiniboine]], [[Sioux]] and [[ojibway]] inhabited the county.\n\nThe early explorers of the region were fur traders. [[Pembina, North Dakota|Pembina]], North Dakota's oldest settlement, across the [[Red River of the North|Red River]] from Kittson County, dates from 1797, when the first trading post was established by Charles Baptiste Chaboillez of the [[Northwest Fur Company]]. The [[Hudson's Bay Company|Hudson Bay]] and American Fur Companies were also in Pembina as the fur trading industry increased. The fur traders and [[voyageurs]] traveled on the eastern side of the Red. [[Alexander Henry the younger]], who erected a fort for the North West Company in Pembina, is thought to be the first white man to test agriculture in the valley.

The need for oxcarts diminished as steamboats became the new mode for transporting furs and supplies. The steamboats were eventually replaced by the railroad.\n\nPembina County was one of five large counties established by the [[Minnesota Territory]] legislature on October 27, 1849. It was not organized at that time. On March 9, 1878, the Minnesota Legislature renamed Pembina County Kittson County. On February 25, 1879, Kittson County was divided, creating [[Marshall County, Minnesota|Marshall County]]. The county seat, Hallock, was organized in 1880. Kittson County was further diminished in 1894 when [[Roseau County, Minnesota|Roseau County]] was partitioned off.

With rumors of a railroad coming through, settlers moved there to stake their claims. Many of these early settlers were [[M\u00e9tis in the United States|M\u00e9tis]], a mixture of native and naturalized North Americans. In 1878, the [[St. Paul & Pacific Railroad]] line reached St. Vincent and opened the area to settlement.

The eastern portion of the county was settled in the early 1900s. The [[Minneapolis, St. Paul and Sault Ste.

Evidence has been found that the Laurel, Arvilla, St. Croix, and Blackduck complexes were the area's early occupants. Approximately 400 years ago, the [[Cree]], [[Assiniboine people|Assiniboine]], [[Sioux]] and [[Ojibway]] inhabited the county.\n\nThe early explorers of the region were fur traders. [[Pembina, North Dakota|Pembina]], North Dakota's oldest settlement, across the [[Red River of the North|Red River]] from Kittson County, dates from 1797, when the first trading post was established by Charles Baptiste Chaboillez of the [[Northwest Fur Company]]. The [[Hudson's Bay Company|Hudson Bay]] and American Fur Companies were also in Pembina as the fur trading industry increased. The fur traders and [[voyageurs]] traveled on the eastern side of the Red. [[Alexander Henry the younger]], who erected a fort for the North West Company in Pembina, is thought to be the first white man to test agriculture in the valley. [[Joe Rolette]], who started a fur post for the American Fur Company in Pembina, and Norman W.

The need for oxcarts diminished as steamboats became the new mode for transporting furs and supplies. The steamboats were eventually replaced by the railroad.\n\nPembina County was one of five large counties established by the [[Minnesota Territory]] legislature on October 27, 1849. It was not organized at that time. On March 9, 1878, the Minnesota Legislature renamed Pembina County Kittson County. On February 25, 1879, Kittson County was divided, creating [[Marshall County, Minnesota|Marshall County]]. The county seat, Hallock, was organized in 1880. Kittson County was further diminished in 1894 when [[Roseau County, Minnesota|Roseau County]] was partitioned off. Kittson County has retained its present boundaries since 1894.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=ShcLAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA535#v=onepage&q&f=false Upham, Warren.

With rumors of a railroad coming through, settlers moved there to stake their claims. Many of these early settlers were [[M\u00e9tis in the United States|M\u00e9tis]], a mixture of native and naturalized North Americans. In 1878, the [[St. Paul & Pacific Railroad]] line reached St. Vincent and opened the area to settlement. It extended through the western portion of the county, with [[Donaldson, Minnesota|Donaldson]], [[Kennedy, Minnesota|Kennedy]], Hallock, [[Northcote, Minnesota|Northcote]], [[Humboldt, Minnesota|Humboldt]] and [[St. Vincent, Minnesota|St. Vincent]] established along the line. The eastern portion of the county was settled in the early 1900s. The [[Minneapolis, St. Paul and Sault Ste. Marie Railroad|Soo Line]] railroad was completed in 1904 and the communities of [[Karlstad, Minnesota|Karlstad]], [[Halma, Minnesota|Halma]], [[Lake Bronson, Minnesota|Bronson]], [[Lancaster, Minnesota|Lancaster]], [[Orleans, Minnesota|Orleans]] and [[Noyes, Minnesota|Noyes]] were established. Scandinavians, Ukrainians, Polish, Scottish, Irish, English, Germans, French Canadians and M\u00e9tis all contributed to Kittson County's melting pot.\n\nOnce home to over 10,000 residents, the county population declined below 5,000 in 2006.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://origin.kare11.com/news/investigative/extras/extra_article.aspx?storyid=496115&catid=57|title=Struggle for survival in Kittson County|publisher=[[KARE]]|author=Jane Helmke|year=2008|accessdate=November 24, 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20130127035924/http://origin.kare11.com/news/investigative/extras/extra_article.aspx?storyid=496115&catid=57|archivedate=January 27, 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Historic sites===\nThree sites in the county are listed in the [[National Register of Historic Places]]: the [[St. Nicholas Orthodox Church]], in [[Caribou Township, Minnesota|Caribou Township]]; the [[burial mounds]] known as the \"[[Lake Bronson Site]]\", in [[Norway Township, Kittson County, Minnesota|Norway]] and [[Percy Township, Minnesota|Percy]] Townships; and the [[Lake Bronson State Park]] [[Works Progress Administration|WPA]]/Rustic Style Historic Resources, which include an observation tower and several buildings.

The [[Joe River]] flows northwest out of the county into Canada, to discharge into the Red a few miles past the international border.\n\nThe county's terrain consists of low rolling hills, devoted to agriculture.<ref name=KCM>[https://www.google.com/maps/place/Kittson+County,+MN/@48.8079962,-96.919407,43195m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x52c13a5a007e5ab1:0xa9194f798800e19b!8m2!3d48.7563083!4d-96.865445 ''Kittson County MN''  Google Maps (accessed 16 March 2019)]</ref> The terrain slopes to the north and west, with its highest point near the southeast corner at 1,079' (329m) ASL.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.daftlogic.com/sandbox-google-maps-find-altitude.htm |title=\"Find an Altitude/Kittson County MN\"  Google Maps (accessed 16 March 2019) |access-date=March 16, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190521043409/https://www.daftlogic.com/sandbox-google-maps-find-altitude.htm |archive-date=May 21, 2019 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The county has a total area of {{convert|1104|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|1099|sqmi}} is land and {{convert|4.8|sqmi}} (0.4%) is water.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/docs/gazetteer/counties_list_27.txt|publisher=US Census Bureau|accessdate=October 18, 2014|date=August 22, 2012|title=2010 Census Gazetteer Files|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921060200/http://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/docs/gazetteer/counties_list_27.txt|archivedate=September 21, 2013}}</ref>\n\nKittson County was once part of glacial [[Lake Agassiz]]. Evidence of this prehistoric lake can still be seen in the county's topography. Remnants of McCauleyville Beach can be found in the eastern part of the county, an area of sandy soil and sand ridges. Other evidence of the glacier and Lake Agassiz is the approximately 140' drop in elevation from the eastern part of the county to the western part, near the Red River Valley, with its proliferation of black rich soil.

It is found in the northern Atlantic Ocean and in rivers that flow into this ocean. Most populations of this fish species are [[anadromous]], hatching in streams and rivers but moving out to sea as they grow where they mature, after which the adult fish seasonally move upstream again to spawn.<ref name=\"Audubon\">{{cite book |title=The Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Fishes, Whales & Dolphins |publisher=Chanticleer Press |year=1983 |page=395}}</ref> When the mature fish re-enter rivers to spawn, they change in colour and appearance. Some populations of this fish only migrate to large lakes, and are \"landlocked\", spending their entire lives in freshwater. Such populations are found throughout the range of the species. Unlike Pacific species of salmon, ''S. salar'' is [[iteroparous]], which means it can survive spawning and return to sea to have a go at it again in another year -such individuals can grow to extremely large sizes, although they are rare. The different life stages of the fish are known by many different names in English: [[alevin]], [[spawn (biology)|fry]], [[parr (fish)|parr]] and [[Juvenile fish|smolt]]. Atlantic salmon is considered a very healthy food and one of the fish with a more refined taste in many cultures and as such it features in numerous popular traditional cuisines and can fetch a higher price than some other fish. It has thus long been the target of [[sports fishing|recreational]] and [[commercial fishing]], and this, as well as [[habitat destruction]], has impacted the population in some areas, and as such the species is the subject of conservation efforts in several countries, which appear to have been somewhat successful since the 2000s. Techniques to farm this species using [[aquaculture|aquacultural]] methods have also been developed, and at present it is farmed in great numbers in many places around the world, and although this is now a viable alternative to wild-caught fish it has also attracted criticism from environmentalists.\n\n==Nomenclature==\nThe Atlantic salmon was given its scientific binomial name by [[zoology|zoologist]] and [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomist]] [[Carl Linnaeus]] in [[10th edition of Systema Naturae|1758]]. The name, ''Salmo salar'', derives from the [[Latin]] ''salmo'', meaning [[salmon]], and ''salar'', meaning leaper, according to M. Barton,<ref>Barton, M.: \"Biology of Fishes.\", pages 198\u2013202 Thompson Brooks/Cole 2007</ref> but more likely meaning \"resident of salt water\" {{citation needed|date=January 2017}}.  Lewis and Short's Latin Dictionary (Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1879) translates ''salar'' as a kind of trout from its use in the ''Idylls'' of the poet Ausonius (4th century CE). Later, the differently coloured smolts were found to be the same species.\n\nOther names used for the Atlantic salmon are: bay salmon, black salmon, caplin-scull salmon, fiddler, sebago salmon, silver salmon, outside salmon and winnish. At different points in their maturation and life cycle, they are known as parr, smolt, grilse, grilt, kelt, slink, and spring salmon. Atlantic salmon that do not journey to sea are known as landlocked salmon (or {{Interlanguage link|ouananiche|fr|}} in North America).<ref name=weebly>{{cite web|title=Atlantic Salmon|url=http://animallist.weebly.com/atlantic-salmon.html |work=animallist.weebly.com |accessdate=19 November 2013}}</ref>{{Citation needed|date=March 2013|reason=this source just has a list of names}}\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Atlantic salmon Atlantic fish.jpg|thumb|left|{{center|Atlantic salmon are among the largest salmon species}}]]\n\nAtlantic salmon are the largest species in their genus, ''Salmo''.

At maturity, they take on a silver-blue sheen. The easiest way of identifying them as an adult is by the black spots predominantly above the [[lateral line]], though the [[caudal fin]] is usually unspotted. When they reproduce, males take on a slight green or red colouration. The salmon has a [[wikt:fusiform|fusiform]] body, and well-developed [[tooth|teeth]].

The fur trade, timber harvesting, dams and mills and agriculture degraded freshwater habitats and lowered the carrying capacity of most North American streams. Beaver populations were trapped to near-extinction by 1800, and log drives and clear-cutting further exacerbated stream erosion and habitat loss. As timber and fur gave way to agriculture, freshwater Atlantic salmon habitat was further compromised. According to historian D.W. Dunfield (1985) \"over half of the historical Atlantic salmon runs had been lost in North America by 1850\". In the Gulf Region of Nova Scotia it was reported that 31 of the 33 Atlantic salmon streams were blocked off by lumber dams, leading to the [[Local extinction|extirpation]] of early-run fish in many watersheds. The inshore Atlantic salmon fishery became a major export of the New World, with major fishing operations establishing along the shores of major river systems. The southernmost populations were the first to disappear.\n\nYoung salmon spend one to four years in their natal river. When they are large enough (c. {{convert|15|cm|in}}), they [[smoltification|smoltify]], changing camouflage from stream-adapted with large, gray spots to sea-adapted with shiny sides. They also undergo some endocrinological changes to adapt to [[osmosis|osmotic]] differences between fresh water and seawater habitat. When smoltification is complete, the parr (young fish) now begin to swim with the current instead of against it. With this behavioral change, the fish are now referred to as smolt. When the smolt reach the sea, they follow sea surface currents and feed on plankton or fry from other fish species such as herring. During their time at sea, they can sense the change in the Earth magnetic field through iron in their lateral line.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\nWhen they have had a year of good growth, they will move to the sea surface currents that transport them back to their natal river. It is a major misconception that salmon swim thousands of kilometres at sea; instead they surf through sea surface currents.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} It is possible they find their natal river by smell, although this is not confirmed;<ref name=\"Shearer\">{{cite book |author=Shearer, W. |title=The Atlantic Salmon |publisher=Halstead Press |year=1992}}</ref> only 5% of Atlantic salmon go up the wrong river.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} The range of an individual Atlantic salmon can thus be the river where they are born and the sea surface currents that are connected to that river in a circular path.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nWild salmon disappeared from many rivers during the twentieth century due to [[overfishing]] and habitat change.<ref name=\"Shearer\"/>\n\n==Ecology==\n===Diet===\nYoung salmon begin a feeding response within a few days.

The most commonly eaten foods include [[caddisfly|caddisflies]], [[black fly|blackflies]], [[mayfly|mayflies]], and [[stonefly|stoneflies]].<ref name=\"Shearer\"/>\n\nAs adults, the salmon prefer [[capelin]] as their meal of choice.

During this developmental stage, their young gills develop and they become active hunters. Next is the [[spawn (biology)|fry]] stage, where the fish grow and subsequently leave the breeding ground in search of food. During this time, they move to areas with higher prey concentration. The final freshwater stage is when they develop into [[parr (fish)|parr]], in which they prepare for the trek to the Atlantic Ocean.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}\n\nDuring these times, the Atlantic salmon are very susceptible to [[predation]]. Nearly 40% are eaten by [[trout]] alone. Other predators include other fish and birds.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} Egg and juvenile survival is dependent on habitat quality as Atlantic salmon are sensitive to ecological change.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}\n\n====Saltwater phases====\nWhen parr develop into [[Juvenile fish|smolt]], they begin the trip to the ocean, which predominantly happens between March and June. Migration allows [[acclimate|acclimation]] to the changing [[salinity]]. Once ready, young smolt leave, preferring an [[wikt:Ebb tide|ebb tide]].\n\nHaving left their [[Natal homing|natal streams]], they experience a period of rapid growth during the one to four years they live in the ocean. Typically, Atlantic salmon migrate from their home streams to an area on the continental plate off West [[Greenland]]. During this time, they face predation from humans, [[Pinniped|seals]], [[Greenland shark]]s, [[Skate (fish)|skate]], [[cod]], and [[halibut]]. Some [[dolphin]]s have been noticed playing with dead salmon, but it is still unclear whether they consume them.\n\nOnce large enough, Atlantic salmon change into the [[grilse]] phase, when they become ready to return to the same freshwater tributary they departed from as smolts. After returning to their natal streams, the salmon will cease eating altogether prior to spawning. Although largely unknown, odor \u2013 the exact chemical signature of that stream \u2013 may play an important role in how salmon return to the area where they hatched. Once heavier than about 250&nbsp;g, the fish no longer become prey for birds and many fish, although seals do prey upon them. [[Grey seal|Grey]] and [[Common seal|common]] seals commonly eat Atlantic salmon.

The female creates a powerful downdraught of water with her tail near the gravel to excavate a depression. After she and a male fish have eggs and [[milt]] (sperm), respectively, upstream of the depression, the female again uses her tail, this time to shift gravel to cover the eggs and milt which have lodged in the depression.\n\nUnlike the various Pacific salmon species which die after spawning ([[semelparous]]), the Atlantic salmon is [[iteroparous]], which means the fish may recondition themselves and return to the sea to repeat the migration and spawning pattern several times, although most spawn only once or twice.<ref name=\"Audubon\"/><ref name=\"Heen\">{{cite book |author=Heen, K. |title=Salmon Aquaculture |publisher=Halstead Press |year=1993}}</ref> Migration and spawning exact an enormous physiological toll on individuals, such that repeat spawners are the exception rather than the norm.<ref name=\"Heen\"/> Atlantic salmon show high diversity in age of maturity and may mature as parr, one- to five-sea-winter fish, and in rare instances, at older sea ages. This variety of ages can occur in the same population, constituting a '[[Bet-hedging (biology)|bet hedging]]' strategy against variation in stream flows. So in a drought year, some fish of a given age will not return to spawn, allowing that generation other, wetter years in which to spawn.<ref name=Klemetsen/>\n\n====Hybridization====\nWhen in shared breeding habitats, Atlantic salmon will hybridize with [[brown trout]] (''Salmo trutta'').<ref>Youngson, A.

His son [[Edward II of England|Edward II]] continued, regulating the construction of [[weir]]s. Enforcement was overseen by those appointed by the [[justices of the peace]]. Because of confusing laws and the appointed conservators having little power, most laws were barely enforced.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}\n\nBased on this, a royal commission was appointed in 1860 to thoroughly investigate the Atlantic salmon and the laws governing the species, resulting in the 1861 Salmon Fisheries Act. The act placed enforcement of the laws under the [[Home Office]]'s control, but it was later transferred to the [[Board of Trade]], and then later to the [[Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food|Board of Agriculture and Fisheries]]. Another act passed in 1865 imposed charges to fish and catch limits. It also caused the formation of local boards having jurisdiction over a certain river. The next significant act, passed in 1907, allowed the board to charge 'duties' to catch other freshwater fish, including trout.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}\n\nDespite legislation, board effects decreased until, in 1948, the River Boards Act gave authority of all freshwater fish and  the prevention of pollution to one board per river. In total, it created 32 boards. In 1974, the 32 boards were reduced to 10 regional water authorities (RWAs). Although only the [[Northumbria]]n, [[Welsh people|Welsh]], northwest and southwest RWA's had considerable salmon populations, all ten also cared for trout and [[freshwater eel]]s.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}\n\nThe Salmon and Freshwater Fisheries Act was passed in 1975.

It is found in the northern Atlantic Ocean and in rivers that flow into this ocean. Most populations of this fish species are [[anadromous]], hatching in streams and rivers but moving out to sea as they grow where they mature, after which the adult fish seasonally move upstream again to spawn.<ref name=\"Audubon\">{{cite book |title=The Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Fishes, Whales & Dolphins |publisher=Chanticleer Press |year=1983 |page=395}}</ref> When the mature fish re-enter rivers to spawn, they change in colour and appearance. Some populations of this fish only migrate to large lakes, and are \"landlocked\", spending their entire lives in freshwater. Such populations are found throughout the range of the species. Unlike Pacific species of salmon, ''S. salar'' is [[iteroparous]], which means it can survive spawning and return to sea to have a go at it again in another year -such individuals can grow to extremely large sizes, although they are rare. The different life stages of the fish are known by many different names in English: [[alevin]], [[spawn (biology)|fry]], [[parr (fish)|parr]] and [[Juvenile fish|smolt]]. Atlantic salmon is considered a very healthy food and one of the fish with a more refined taste in many cultures and as such it features in numerous popular traditional cuisines and can fetch a higher price than some other fish. It has thus long been the target of [[sports fishing|recreational]] and [[commercial fishing]], and this, as well as [[habitat destruction]], has impacted the population in some areas, and as such the species is the subject of conservation efforts in several countries, which appear to have been somewhat successful since the 2000s. Techniques to farm this species using [[aquaculture|aquacultural]] methods have also been developed, and at present it is farmed in great numbers in many places around the world, and although this is now a viable alternative to wild-caught fish it has also attracted criticism from environmentalists.\n\n==Nomenclature==\nThe Atlantic salmon was given its scientific binomial name by [[zoology|zoologist]] and [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomist]] [[Carl Linnaeus]] in [[10th edition of Systema Naturae|1758]]. The name, ''Salmo salar'', derives from the [[Latin]] ''salmo'', meaning [[salmon]], and ''salar'', meaning leaper, according to M. Barton,<ref>Barton, M.: \"Biology of Fishes.\", pages 198\u2013202 Thompson Brooks/Cole 2007</ref> but more likely meaning \"resident of salt water\" {{citation needed|date=January 2017}}.  Lewis and Short's Latin Dictionary (Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1879) translates ''salar'' as a kind of trout from its use in the ''Idylls'' of the poet Ausonius (4th century CE). Later, the differently coloured smolts were found to be the same species.\n\nOther names used for the Atlantic salmon are: bay salmon, black salmon, caplin-scull salmon, fiddler, sebago salmon, silver salmon, outside salmon and winnish. At different points in their maturation and life cycle, they are known as parr, smolt, grilse, grilt, kelt, slink, and spring salmon. Atlantic salmon that do not journey to sea are known as landlocked salmon (or {{Interlanguage link|ouananiche|fr|}} in North America).<ref name=weebly>{{cite web|title=Atlantic Salmon|url=http://animallist.weebly.com/atlantic-salmon.html |work=animallist.weebly.com |accessdate=19 November 2013}}</ref>{{Citation needed|date=March 2013|reason=this source just has a list of names}}\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Atlantic salmon Atlantic fish.jpg|thumb|left|{{center|Atlantic salmon are among the largest salmon species}}]]\n\nAtlantic salmon are the largest species in their genus, ''Salmo''.

The fur trade, timber harvesting, dams and mills and agriculture degraded freshwater habitats and lowered the carrying capacity of most North American streams. Beaver populations were trapped to near-extinction by 1800, and log drives and clear-cutting further exacerbated stream erosion and habitat loss. As timber and fur gave way to agriculture, freshwater Atlantic salmon habitat was further compromised. According to historian D.W. Dunfield (1985) \"over half of the historical Atlantic salmon runs had been lost in North America by 1850\". In the Gulf Region of Nova Scotia it was reported that 31 of the 33 Atlantic salmon streams were blocked off by lumber dams, leading to the [[Local extinction|extirpation]] of early-run fish in many watersheds. The inshore Atlantic salmon fishery became a major export of the New World, with major fishing operations establishing along the shores of major river systems. The southernmost populations were the first to disappear.\n\nYoung salmon spend one to four years in their natal river. When they are large enough (c. {{convert|15|cm|in}}), they [[smoltification|smoltify]], changing camouflage from stream-adapted with large, gray spots to sea-adapted with shiny sides. They also undergo some endocrinological changes to adapt to [[osmosis|osmotic]] differences between fresh water and seawater habitat. When smoltification is complete, the parr (young fish) now begin to swim with the current instead of against it. With this behavioral change, the fish are now referred to as smolt. When the smolt reach the sea, they follow sea surface currents and feed on plankton or fry from other fish species such as herring. During their time at sea, they can sense the change in the Earth magnetic field through iron in their lateral line.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\nWhen they have had a year of good growth, they will move to the sea surface currents that transport them back to their natal river. It is a major misconception that salmon swim thousands of kilometres at sea; instead they surf through sea surface currents.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} It is possible they find their natal river by smell, although this is not confirmed;<ref name=\"Shearer\">{{cite book |author=Shearer, W. |title=The Atlantic Salmon |publisher=Halstead Press |year=1992}}</ref> only 5% of Atlantic salmon go up the wrong river.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} The range of an individual Atlantic salmon can thus be the river where they are born and the sea surface currents that are connected to that river in a circular path.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nWild salmon disappeared from many rivers during the twentieth century due to [[overfishing]] and habitat change.<ref name=\"Shearer\"/>\n\n==Ecology==\n===Diet===\nYoung salmon begin a feeding response within a few days.

Numerous examples of fully freshwater (i.e., \"landlocked\") populations of the species exist throughout the [[Northern Hemisphere]],<ref name=\"Audubon\"/> including a now extinct population in [[Lake Ontario]], which have been shown in recent studies to have spent their entire life cycle in watershed of the lake.<ref name=lake>[https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2016/11/08/study-sheds-light-on-extinct-lake-ontario-salmon.html \"Study sheds light on extinct Lake Ontario salmon\"].

During this developmental stage, their young gills develop and they become active hunters. Next is the [[spawn (biology)|fry]] stage, where the fish grow and subsequently leave the breeding ground in search of food. During this time, they move to areas with higher prey concentration. The final freshwater stage is when they develop into [[parr (fish)|parr]], in which they prepare for the trek to the Atlantic Ocean.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}\n\nDuring these times, the Atlantic salmon are very susceptible to [[predation]]. Nearly 40% are eaten by [[trout]] alone. Other predators include other fish and birds.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} Egg and juvenile survival is dependent on habitat quality as Atlantic salmon are sensitive to ecological change.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}\n\n====Saltwater phases====\nWhen parr develop into [[Juvenile fish|smolt]], they begin the trip to the ocean, which predominantly happens between March and June. Migration allows [[acclimate|acclimation]] to the changing [[salinity]]. Once ready, young smolt leave, preferring an [[wikt:Ebb tide|ebb tide]].\n\nHaving left their [[Natal homing|natal streams]], they experience a period of rapid growth during the one to four years they live in the ocean. Typically, Atlantic salmon migrate from their home streams to an area on the continental plate off West [[Greenland]]. During this time, they face predation from humans, [[Pinniped|seals]], [[Greenland shark]]s, [[Skate (fish)|skate]], [[cod]], and [[halibut]]. Some [[dolphin]]s have been noticed playing with dead salmon, but it is still unclear whether they consume them.\n\nOnce large enough, Atlantic salmon change into the [[grilse]] phase, when they become ready to return to the same freshwater tributary they departed from as smolts. After returning to their natal streams, the salmon will cease eating altogether prior to spawning. Although largely unknown, odor \u2013 the exact chemical signature of that stream \u2013 may play an important role in how salmon return to the area where they hatched. Once heavier than about 250&nbsp;g, the fish no longer become prey for birds and many fish, although seals do prey upon them. [[Grey seal|Grey]] and [[Common seal|common]] seals commonly eat Atlantic salmon.

The female creates a powerful downdraught of water with her tail near the gravel to excavate a depression. After she and a male fish have eggs and [[milt]] (sperm), respectively, upstream of the depression, the female again uses her tail, this time to shift gravel to cover the eggs and milt which have lodged in the depression.\n\nUnlike the various Pacific salmon species which die after spawning ([[semelparous]]), the Atlantic salmon is [[iteroparous]], which means the fish may recondition themselves and return to the sea to repeat the migration and spawning pattern several times, although most spawn only once or twice.<ref name=\"Audubon\"/><ref name=\"Heen\">{{cite book |author=Heen, K. |title=Salmon Aquaculture |publisher=Halstead Press |year=1993}}</ref> Migration and spawning exact an enormous physiological toll on individuals, such that repeat spawners are the exception rather than the norm.<ref name=\"Heen\"/> Atlantic salmon show high diversity in age of maturity and may mature as parr, one- to five-sea-winter fish, and in rare instances, at older sea ages. This variety of ages can occur in the same population, constituting a '[[Bet-hedging (biology)|bet hedging]]' strategy against variation in stream flows. So in a drought year, some fish of a given age will not return to spawn, allowing that generation other, wetter years in which to spawn.<ref name=Klemetsen/>\n\n====Hybridization====\nWhen in shared breeding habitats, Atlantic salmon will hybridize with [[brown trout]] (''Salmo trutta'').<ref>Youngson, A.

It was established in 1983 to help protect Atlantic salmon stocks, through the cooperation between nations. They work to restore habitat and promote conservation of the salmon.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nasco.int/ |title=NASCO ~ The North Atlantic Salmon Conservation Organization |publisher=Nasco.int |accessdate=11 February 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130121144822/http://www.nasco.int/ |archivedate=21 January 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n==Legislation==\n===England and Wales===\n[[Edward I of England|Edward I]] instituted a penalty for collecting salmon during certain times of the year. His son [[Edward II of England|Edward II]] continued, regulating the construction of [[weir]]s. Enforcement was overseen by those appointed by the [[justices of the peace]]. Because of confusing laws and the appointed conservators having little power, most laws were barely enforced.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}\n\nBased on this, a royal commission was appointed in 1860 to thoroughly investigate the Atlantic salmon and the laws governing the species, resulting in the 1861 Salmon Fisheries Act. The act placed enforcement of the laws under the [[Home Office]]'s control, but it was later transferred to the [[Board of Trade]], and then later to the [[Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food|Board of Agriculture and Fisheries]]. Another act passed in 1865 imposed charges to fish and catch limits. It also caused the formation of local boards having jurisdiction over a certain river. The next significant act, passed in 1907, allowed the board to charge 'duties' to catch other freshwater fish, including trout.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}\n\nDespite legislation, board effects decreased until, in 1948, the River Boards Act gave authority of all freshwater fish and  the prevention of pollution to one board per river. In total, it created 32 boards. In 1974, the 32 boards were reduced to 10 regional water authorities (RWAs). Although only the [[Northumbria]]n, [[Welsh people|Welsh]], northwest and southwest RWA's had considerable salmon populations, all ten also cared for trout and [[freshwater eel]]s.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}\n\nThe Salmon and Freshwater Fisheries Act was passed in 1975. Among other things, it regulated fishing licences, seasons, and size limits, and banned obstructing the salmon's migratory paths.<ref name=\"Shearer\"/>\n\n===Scotland===\nSalmon was greatly valued in [[medieval Scotland]], and various fishing methods, including the use of [[weir]]s, cruives, and nets, were used to catch the fish. Fishing for salmon was heavily regulated in order to conserve the resource.<ref name=\"Buchanan\">Kate Buchanan, \"Wheeles and Creels: The Physical Representation of the Right to Milling and Fishing in Sixteenth-Century Angus, Scotland\" in ''Medieval and Early Modern Representations of Authority in Scotland and the British Isles'' (eds. Kate Buchanan & Lucinda H.S.

The volume of the early Scottish salmon trade is impossible to determine, since surviving custom records date only from the 1420 onward, and since Aberdeen [[Burgess (title)|burgess]]es enjoyed an exemption on salmon customs until the 1530s.<ref>Katie Stevenson, ''Power and Propaganda: Scotland, 1306-1488'' (Edinburgh University Press, 2014).</ref>\n\nDuring the 15th century, many laws were passed; many regulated fishing times, and worked to ensure smolts could safely pass downstream. [[James III of Scotland|James III]] even closed a [[flour|meal]] [[watermill|mill]] because of its history of killing fish attracted to the wheel.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}\n\nMore recent legislation has established commissioners who manage districts. Furthermore, the Salmon and Freshwater Fisheries Act in 1951 required the [[Secretary of State for Scotland|Secretary of State]] be given data about the catches of salmon and trout to help establish catch limits.<ref name=\"Shearer\"/><ref name=\"Sedgwick\"/>\n\n===United States===\nSeveral populations of Atlantic salmon are in serious decline, and are listed as endangered under the [[Endangered Species Act]] (ESA). Currently, runs of 11 rivers in Maine are on the list \u2013 Kennebec, Androscoggin, Penobscot, Sheepscot, Ducktrap, Cove Brook, Pleasant, Narraguagus, Machias, East Machias and Dennys. The [[Penobscot River]] is the \"anchor river\" for Atlantic salmon populations in the US. Returning fish in 2008 were around 2,000, more than double the 2007 return of 940.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}\n\nSection 9 of the ESA makes it illegal to take an endangered species of fish or wildlife. The definition of \"take\" is to \"harass, harm, pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, capture, or collect, or to attempt to engage in any such conduct\".<ref>(16 U.S.C. 1532(19)) http://www.epa.gov/EPA-SPECIES/1998/May/Day-01/e11668.htm{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n===Canada===\nThe [[Government of Canada|federal government]] has prime responsibility for protecting the Atlantic salmon, but over the last generation, effort has continued to shift management as much as possible to [[provinces and territories of Canada|provincial authorities]] through memoranda of understanding, for example. A new Atlantic salmon policy is in the works, and in the past three years,{{When|date=February 2011}} the government has attempted to pass a new version of the century-old Fisheries Act through Parliament.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}\n\nFederal legislation regarding at-risk populations is weak.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} Inner [[Bay of Fundy]] Atlantic salmon runs were declared endangered in 2000. As of 2008, no recovery plan is in place.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}\n\n[[Nongovernmental organizations]], such as the [[Atlantic Salmon Federation]],<ref>http://www.asf.ca/</ref> constantly demand for improvements in management, and for initiatives to be considered. For example, the ASF and the Nova Scotia Salmon Association desire the use of technology for mitigation of [[acid rain]]-affected rivers such as used in Norway is in 54 [[Nova Scotia]] rivers and managed to raise the funds to get a project in place in one river.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}\n\nIn Quebec, the daily catch limit for Atlantic salmon is dependent on the individual river. Some rivers are strictly catch and release with a limit of 3 released fish. Each catch must be declared. Some rivers allow you to keep between 1 or 2 grilse (30cm to 63cm), while some of the more prolific rivers (mainly on the north coast) will allow you to keep 1 salmon over 63cm. The annual catch limit is 4 Atlantic salmon of small size and only 1 of those may be bigger than 63cm.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}\n\nIn Lake Ontario, the historic populations of Atlantic salmon became extinct, and cross-national efforts have been under way to reintroduce the species, with some areas already having restocked naturally reproducing populations.<ref>{{cite web|title=Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)|url=http://www.bringbackthesalmon.ca/?page_id=101|website=Bring Back the Salmon Lake Ontario|accessdate=17 September 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Endangered Populations|url=http://www.asf.ca/endangered-populations.html|website=Atlantic Salmon Federation|accessdate=17 September 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150919172245/http://www.asf.ca/endangered-populations.html|archive-date=19 September 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[AquAdvantage salmon]], a genetically modified Atlantic salmon\n* [[Atlantic Salmon Federation]]\n* [[Salmon as food]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|refs=}}\n\n==References==\n* [http://www.fishwatch.gov/seafood_profiles/species/salmon/species_pages/atlantic_salmon.htm Atlantic salmon] ''NOAA FishWatch''.

This is due to the economic situation that applies mainly to impoverished people, who seek better job and growth opportunities in other countries. More than 11% of Mexico's native population lives abroad,{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}} making it the country with the most emigrants in the world.{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}} 98% of all Mexican emigrants reside in the United States,{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}} which are more than 12 million (documented and undocumented) migrants.{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}} Estimates on the amount of Mexican emigrants of indigenous origin in the U.S. range between 50% and 90% of the entire emigrant population.{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}} There are no official numbers on the amount of indigenous Mexican migrants, as U.S. censuses do not cover their specific ethnic origin. Recent reports by the [[Pew Research Center]] (February 2012) indicate that the current migratory influx from Mexico to the U.S. is just below a net zero, as more Mexicans leave the U.S. Economic problems are, overall, the little stability of [[Mexican peso]] exchange rate compared to the [[United States dollar]]. Because of this, many Mexicans choose to leave their native country and look for better economic opportunities in the [[United States]], and send dollars to their families in Mexico. For some, this is only a temporary stay in America while working. However, many others choose to permanently reside in the U.S. with their families.\n\n==Destinations==\n[[File:Pi\u00f1ata.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Pi\u00f1ata, Mexico Day in Germany.]]\nAside from the [[Mexican American|United States]], Mexican immigrants have settled in [[Mexican Canadian|Canada]], [[Mexican immigration to Spain|Spain]], [[Mexicans in Germany|Germany]], [[Italy]], the [[Mexicans in the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]], [[France]], [[Japan]] and other countries. A large Mexican immigrant population also exists in Central and South American countries as [[Mexicans in Guatemala|Guatemala]], [[Mexicans in Costa Rica|Costa Rica]], [[Mexicans in Cuba|Cuba]], [[Brazil]], [[Colombia]], [[Puerto Rico]] and [[Chile]]. Mexican Mennonites settled in [[Bolivia]], [[Argentina]] and [[Paraguay]]. There have been cases of Mexicans working or residing in [[Saudi Arabia]] and other countries but not in demographically significative numbers {{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}. Under \"Aliyah\", or the immigration of Jews of the Diaspora to [[Israel]], an unspecified number of Mexican Jews have immigrated to Israel. In recent years Mexican business and engineering professionals have settled in African countries like [[Kenya]], [[Nigeria]] and [[South Africa]]. \n \nCanada has a program that hires Mexican agricultural workers on a temporary basis. Many countries allow Mexicans opportunities in areas like science research, to study at colleges and universities, and through other cultural exchanges. The mass departure of artists, scientists, actors and more has led to a Mexican [[brain drain]]. However, recent years have shown an uptick in immigration to Mexico.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/22/world/americas/for-migrants-new-land-of-opportunity-is-mexico.html|title=For Migrants, New Land of Opportunity Is Mexico|first=Damien|last=Cave|date=21 September 2013|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref>\n\n==Migrants==\n\nGenerally, the people who tend to leave Mexico for the United States are from [[social class|lower-class backgrounds]].

In these states it is not uncommon to see towns where men are absent, and are supposed to be working in the [[United States]]. While the women take care of their children, husbands [[Remittances from the United States|send money (dollars) to their families]] in Mexico. This money, sent by Mexican workers abroad to their country, is called ''[[Remittance|remesas]]'' in Mexican Spanish, and the amount has become the second highest amount of income that Mexico receives from other countries, second only to oil.\n\nTraditionally, affluent people with overwhelming income used to live in Mexico, but recent economic opportunities and advantages with international treaties, harassing, and threatening insecurity have made them leave the country.\n\n==History==\nFollowing the [[Mexican\u2013American War]] which was concluded by the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]] in 1848, and later, the [[Gadsden Purchase]] in 1853, approximately 300,000 Mexican nationals found themselves living within the [[United States]].  Throughout the rest of the 19th century early 20th century, Mexican migration was not subject to any restrictions, and Mexicans were free to move across the border, and often did so, typically in order for them to work in professions such as the construction of the railway system, or as seasonal [[agricultural]] laborers.  From 1910 to 1920, the political violence and societal chaos caused by the [[Mexican Revolution]] also played a role in increasing migration northwards.  Economic inequality, rural poverty, significantly lower wages, and better opportunities have also played a role throughout the 20th century as factors pulling Mexicans to migrate to the US.\n\nThe immigration laws of the United States such as [[Emergency Quota Act]] generally allowed exemptions for Mexico, while being more restrictive to citizens of the [[Eastern Hemisphere]].<ref name=bean/>  Mexicans received special allowances under United States immigration law due to the importance of Mexican labor in the United States [[economy]].

The U.S.-Mexican Border in the Twentieth Century. Wilmington, Scholarly Resources, Inc.: 1999 {{ISBN|0842027564}}.</ref> With the beginning of the Great Depression, the worldwide economic slowdown and the desperate search for jobs within the United States of America, [[Opposition to immigration|anti-immigration sentiment]] rose. Thousands of Mexicans were forced back across the border and barriers to future immigrants were constructed.  From 1929 to 1931, legal Mexican immigration entries fell by 95%, and in the next ten years as many as 400,000 Mexican citizens were [[repatriated]].<ref name=bean/>\n\n===More admissive regulations===\nThe limitations on Mexican immigration lasted until the beginning of [[World War II]], when the United States found itself short of labor.  In 1942 the United States and Mexico instituted the [[Bracero program]].  Under this arrangement, millions of Mexican laborers were contracted to complete agricultural work in the United States.  While under contract they were given housing and received a [[minimum wage]] of thirty cents an hour.  The program was intended to provide the United States with ''temporary'' workers while many working-aged men were away at war.  In order to ensure that braceros did not stay in the United States, their wives and families were not allowed to accompany them in the U.S. Additionally, 10% of each worker's wage was withheld to be given back upon the worker's return to Mexico but few U.S. employers complied.\n\nThe Bracero Program allowed [[agribusiness]] access to a large pool of labor that had virtually no civil rights, and no recourse to address growing injustices.  This inequity was seen in poor working conditions and the decrease in agricultural wages, which during the 1950s, actually dropped below the levels they were at during World War II.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}  As the war ended, few returning soldiers returned to the jobs that the braceros were holding, and instead, they moved on to more industrial areas and reinforced the belief that immigrants take on the jobs that Americans would not be willing to do.\n\nThe [[Politics of Mexico|Mexican government's]] participation and oversight of the treatment of their workers in this program declined over the years, despite remittances from the program that made up a large part of its domestic economy.  The United States began encouraging braceros to cross into Mexico then return illegally to the United States. {{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} Upon return they could become legal citizens, and this eliminated any program contracts as well as the ability of the [[Mexican government]] to intervene in any future labor relations.  In addition to this practice of creating legal citizens of former braceros, thousands of illegal immigrants were crossing the border in search of the opportunity promised by the idea of steady employment and eventual prosperity of the Bracero Program.\n\n==A return to a more closed border==\nIn response to the growing number of Mexicans entering illegally, the United States government implemented [[Operation Wetback]] in 1954.  Under the direction of the [[Immigration and Naturalization Service]] (INS), the [[United States Border Patrol|Border Patrol]] began deporting Mexicans who were in the United States illegally, and up to one million Mexicans were deported. Operation Wetback ended not long after its launch, due to the complaints regarding the violence involved in the deportations, and the fact that in many cases children who were United States citizens were deported with their immigrant parents.<ref>Public Broadcasting Services [https://www.pbs.org/kpbs/theborder/history/index.html \u201cThe Border History\u201d].</ref>\n\n===Continuing migration===\nAlthough the Bracero Program ended in 1964, the migration of Mexican workers did not.  The [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952]] which had put limits on the total number of visas granted, was [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965|amended in 1965]] following the termination of the Bracero Program.  These amendments put an end to the quota system, and instead, created a total number of visas allowed to the Western Hemisphere.  Exceptions to that total number were granted to spouses, minors and parents of United States citizens. However, the total allotment of 120,000 in 1965 still was not enough to address the demand for visas from Mexico.  By 1976, there was a two-year waiting period for any eligible applicant from the Western Hemisphere before they could receive a visa.<ref name=bean>Bean, Frank D. et al (eds).

Lanham, Rowman & Littlefield Publishers, Inc.: 1997 {{ISBN|0847683923}}.</ref>\n\n===Displaced workers in northern Mexico===\nA contributing factor to the persistently high numbers of migrants from Mexico was the creation of the [[Border Industrialization Program]] in 1965.  The termination of the Bracero Program in 1964 had led to both a shortage of workers willing to work for lower wages in the United States, and a high population of displaced workers at the northern Mexico border.  The result of this imbalance in the supply and demand of labor in the two countries in turn led the creation of this new agreement that allowed the construction of foreign-owned factories in northern Mexico.  These factories are referred to as [[maquiladoras]] or maquilas, and provided both Mexico and the United States with a number of benefits.  The factories provided Mexico with a way to increase its manufactured exports to the United States, and in return, the United States received tax benefits for placing its factories within Mexico. For example, the equipment imported into Mexico to be used in the factories was not subject to import taxes, and the final product was only taxed on the value that was added at the factory, rather than the entirety of the item.<ref>Morales, Gerard et al. [http://www.dol.gov/ilab/media/reports/nao/maquilad.htm#viiits \u201cAn Overview of the Maquiladora Program\u201d]. United States Department of Labor. 1994.</ref>\n\nThe creation of the maquilas program provided jobs to the displaced Bracero Program workers and allowed the United States to continue to use labor from Mexico, which was less expensive than labor in the United States.  The popularity of this program is evident in the incredible increase in the number of maquilas in operation: in 1967 there were 57 maquiladoras operating in Mexico; less than ten years later in 1976, that number had increased to 552. The rise in the number of available jobs in the region led to an extreme swell in the population of the border towns.  The maquiladora industry employed 4000 people in 1967, and by 1981 that amount grew to more than 130,000.<ref>Seligson, Mitchell A. & Edward J. Williams. Maquiladoras and Migration: Workers in the Mexico \u2013 United States Border Industrialization Program. Austin, University of Texas Press: 1981, {{ISBN|0292750722}}.</ref>  The maquilas drew the population north to the border in search of employment opportunities, but in many cases the northward pull did not stop there.  The proximity of the United States with its markedly higher standard of living continued to pull the people who had migrated to border region even farther north, and led to higher numbers of migrants crossing the [[United States \u2013 Mexico border]].\n\nAmendments to the [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965|Immigration and Nationality Act]] continued throughout the 1970s.  In 1976 the United State Congress imposed a limit of 20,000 visas per country per year in the Western Hemisphere.  At that time Mexico was exceeding that amount by approximately 40,000.  In 1978 a new amendment was put in place that enacted a worldwide immigration policy, allowing 290,000 visas per year total, with no limitations per country.\n\nThe end of the Bracero Program combined with restrictions put on the number of visas allowed by the United States greatly increased the levels of illegal migration from Mexico.<ref name=bean/> As a response, in 1986 the United States enacted the [[Immigration Reform and Control Act]] (IRCA).  Under this act, all undocumented migrants living in the United States as of January 1, 1982, as well as those who had labored in the seasonal agriculture work for at least ninety days during the previous years were granted legal residence.  IRCA also made it possible to impose civil and criminal penalties on any employer who knowingly hired undocumented workers.  Although a legalization of current undocumented workers, coupled with the increase in penalties suffered by employers who employed future undocumented workers was meant to decrease the total number of undocumented migrants in the United States, the actions did not produce the desired effect; as is evidenced by the number of apprehensions achieved through border patrolling.\n\n==Recent trend reversal in migration between Mexico and the U.S.==\n{{As of | 2017}}, United Nations estimates ranked Mexico as the country with the second-largest total of emigrants in the world.<ref>\n{{cite web\n |url= http://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/migration/publications/populationfacts/docs/MigrationPopFacts20175.pdf\n |title= Population Facts\n |date= December 2017\n |publisher= United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs\n |agency= Population Division\n |page= 3\n |access-date= 8 Feb 2019\n |quote= In  2017, with 16.6 million persons living abroad, India was the leading country of origin of international migrants.

Access to social security, healthcare and education in the U.S. has also become more difficult.\n* The economic situation in Mexico has become better, ensuring better access to healthcare, education, and jobs. This reduces the incentive for Mexicans to leave the country.\n* Since 2010, U.S. legislation has placed stricter controls on illegal immigration: several American states have criminalized illegal immigration. Deportations under the Obama administration (2009-2017) reached record numbers.{{cn|date=February 2019}}\n* During the last few years, violence associated with drug cartels and organized crime has been on the rise in Northern Mexico, making the routes for passing the border more dangerous.\nMexicans and Americans Thinking Together (MATT) conducted 600 in-depth, in-person interviews of migrants who returned to the Mexican state of Jalisco, and found that family reasons and nostalgia are the primary cited reasons for return migration to Mexico. The research also found that of the interviewed migrants who moved back to Mexico, only about 11% were forced to leave the United States due to being deported. 75% of the respondents cited that their reasons for return migration were self-motivated.<ref>Mexicans and Americans Thinking Together (MATT)Quantitative Research Study Preliminary Findings and Insights The US/Mexico Cycle End of an Era http://www.matt.org/uploads/2/4/9/3/24932918/returnmigration_top_line_www.pdf Dec 2013</ref>\n\n===Developments in Mexico===\nMexican source communities, mostly indigenous villages, are most often poor. To survive economically, such areas rely heavily on the emigration of some of their members and on the remittances they send back. Emigration can function as an escape valve to alleviate economic pressures, as it provides a source of income and opens up work opportunities in villages of origin.<ref name=r2/> The return of many migrants thus causes great [[stress (disambiguation) | stress]] on these communities, who are heading for economic crisis as important sources of income fall away and more people become unemployed as there is less work available. The [[States of Mexico | states]] most affected by this phenomenon try to take action to help those who come back, but the full economic impact of the return of migrants is still to come.<ref name=r1/>\n\nWhile emigrants return to their (mostly poor) home communities, sending them into economic crisis, another migration phenomenon is accelerating: internal migration. The lack of work opportunities in small villages drives people to migrate to large cities, rather than to the U.S.  With 78% of the Mexican population living in urban zones, slums are growing fast.{{cn|date=February 2019}} Urban violence and crime, stunted growth, malnutrition, poor elementary education, poor hygiene and inadequate sanitation are just some of the implications of life in urban slums. According to [[UNICEF]], urban migration has badly worsened the reach of social schemes of health and nutrition.<ref>UNICEF, 2012. The State of the World's Children 2012, Executive Summary: Children in an Urban World. New York: United Nations Children's Fund.</ref>{{Full citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nAmong communities of origin, there is a widespread ambivalence towards migrants, as the money they send back is welcome, but there is resentment against the cultural changes that they bring with them when they come back. Returning migrants are blamed for bringing with them drug use, sexually-transmitted diseases, and antisocial behavior. They are held responsible for the abandonment of the traditional indigenous way of life as they bring back western cultural habits and material culture. The return of migrants to Mexico thus has important cultural repercussions and changes the face of their home communities forever.<ref name=r2>Fitzgerald, D., 2009.

This sector constitutes a non-negligible part of the U.S. economy. With the current migration trends, within a few years, Mexico will not be able to cover current demand for Mexican labor of its neighbor anymore. Migration from El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras to the U.S. is rising, as their migrants begin to replace Mexican workers. It is however unclear whether other [[Hispanic America]]n countries follow these trends, and it is unsure whether the gap left by returning Mexicans will be filled by such migrants. Experts{{which?|date=February 2019}} say the consequences for the U.S. economy may be important.<ref name=r1/>\n\nSince 2010, deportations of illegal immigrants have increased, as deportation procedures became more systematic and border controls were reinforced with police and military patrols.

Recent reports by the [[Pew Research Center]] (February 2012) indicate that the current migratory influx from Mexico to the U.S. is just below a net zero, as more Mexicans leave the U.S. Economic problems are, overall, the little stability of [[Mexican peso]] exchange rate compared to the [[United States dollar]]. Because of this, many Mexicans choose to leave their native country and look for better economic opportunities in the [[United States]], and send dollars to their families in Mexico. For some, this is only a temporary stay in America while working. However, many others choose to permanently reside in the U.S. with their families.\n\n==Destinations==\n[[File:Pi\u00f1ata.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Pi\u00f1ata, Mexico Day in Germany.]]\nAside from the [[Mexican American|United States]], Mexican immigrants have settled in [[Mexican Canadian|Canada]], [[Mexican immigration to Spain|Spain]], [[Mexicans in Germany|Germany]], [[Italy]], the [[Mexicans in the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]], [[France]], [[Japan]] and other countries.

In recent years Mexican business and engineering professionals have settled in African countries like [[Kenya]], [[Nigeria]] and [[South Africa]]. \n \nCanada has a program that hires Mexican agricultural workers on a temporary basis. Many countries allow Mexicans opportunities in areas like science research, to study at colleges and universities, and through other cultural exchanges. The mass departure of artists, scientists, actors and more has led to a Mexican [[brain drain]].

This money, sent by Mexican workers abroad to their country, is called ''[[Remittance|remesas]]'' in Mexican Spanish, and the amount has become the second highest amount of income that Mexico receives from other countries, second only to oil.\n\nTraditionally, affluent people with overwhelming income used to live in Mexico, but recent economic opportunities and advantages with international treaties, harassing, and threatening insecurity have made them leave the country.\n\n==History==\nFollowing the [[Mexican\u2013American War]] which was concluded by the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]] in 1848, and later, the [[Gadsden Purchase]] in 1853, approximately 300,000 Mexican nationals found themselves living within the [[United States]].

These amendments put an end to the quota system, and instead, created a total number of visas allowed to the Western Hemisphere.  Exceptions to that total number were granted to spouses, minors and parents of United States citizens. However, the total allotment of 120,000 in 1965 still was not enough to address the demand for visas from Mexico.  By 1976, there was a two-year waiting period for any eligible applicant from the Western Hemisphere before they could receive a visa.<ref name=bean>Bean, Frank D. et al (eds). At the Crossroads: Mexico and U.S. Immigration Policy. Lanham, Rowman & Littlefield Publishers, Inc.: 1997 {{ISBN|0847683923}}.</ref>\n\n===Displaced workers in northern Mexico===\nA contributing factor to the persistently high numbers of migrants from Mexico was the creation of the [[Border Industrialization Program]] in 1965.  The termination of the Bracero Program in 1964 had led to both a shortage of workers willing to work for lower wages in the United States, and a high population of displaced workers at the northern Mexico border.  The result of this imbalance in the supply and demand of labor in the two countries in turn led the creation of this new agreement that allowed the construction of foreign-owned factories in northern Mexico.  These factories are referred to as [[maquiladoras]] or maquilas, and provided both Mexico and the United States with a number of benefits.  The factories provided Mexico with a way to increase its manufactured exports to the United States, and in return, the United States received tax benefits for placing its factories within Mexico. For example, the equipment imported into Mexico to be used in the factories was not subject to import taxes, and the final product was only taxed on the value that was added at the factory, rather than the entirety of the item.<ref>Morales, Gerard et al. [http://www.dol.gov/ilab/media/reports/nao/maquilad.htm#viiits \u201cAn Overview of the Maquiladora Program\u201d]. United States Department of Labor. 1994.</ref>\n\nThe creation of the maquilas program provided jobs to the displaced Bracero Program workers and allowed the United States to continue to use labor from Mexico, which was less expensive than labor in the United States.  The popularity of this program is evident in the incredible increase in the number of maquilas in operation: in 1967 there were 57 maquiladoras operating in Mexico; less than ten years later in 1976, that number had increased to 552. The rise in the number of available jobs in the region led to an extreme swell in the population of the border towns.  The maquiladora industry employed 4000 people in 1967, and by 1981 that amount grew to more than 130,000.<ref>Seligson, Mitchell A. & Edward J. Williams. Maquiladoras and Migration: Workers in the Mexico \u2013 United States Border Industrialization Program. Austin, University of Texas Press: 1981, {{ISBN|0292750722}}.</ref>  The maquilas drew the population north to the border in search of employment opportunities, but in many cases the northward pull did not stop there.  The proximity of the United States with its markedly higher standard of living continued to pull the people who had migrated to border region even farther north, and led to higher numbers of migrants crossing the [[United States \u2013 Mexico border]].\n\nAmendments to the [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965|Immigration and Nationality Act]] continued throughout the 1970s.  In 1976 the United State Congress imposed a limit of 20,000 visas per country per year in the Western Hemisphere.  At that time Mexico was exceeding that amount by approximately 40,000.  In 1978 a new amendment was put in place that enacted a worldwide immigration policy, allowing 290,000 visas per year total, with no limitations per country.\n\nThe end of the Bracero Program combined with restrictions put on the number of visas allowed by the United States greatly increased the levels of illegal migration from Mexico.<ref name=bean/> As a response, in 1986 the United States enacted the [[Immigration Reform and Control Act]] (IRCA).  Under this act, all undocumented migrants living in the United States as of January 1, 1982, as well as those who had labored in the seasonal agriculture work for at least ninety days during the previous years were granted legal residence.  IRCA also made it possible to impose civil and criminal penalties on any employer who knowingly hired undocumented workers.  Although a legalization of current undocumented workers, coupled with the increase in penalties suffered by employers who employed future undocumented workers was meant to decrease the total number of undocumented migrants in the United States, the actions did not produce the desired effect; as is evidenced by the number of apprehensions achieved through border patrolling.\n\n==Recent trend reversal in migration between Mexico and the U.S.==\n{{As of | 2017}}, United Nations estimates ranked Mexico as the country with the second-largest total of emigrants in the world.<ref>\n{{cite web\n |url= http://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/migration/publications/populationfacts/docs/MigrationPopFacts20175.pdf\n |title= Population Facts\n |date= December 2017\n |publisher= United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs\n |agency= Population Division\n |page= 3\n |access-date= 8 Feb 2019\n |quote= In  2017, with 16.6 million persons living abroad, India was the leading country of origin of international migrants.

Richard Miles USA Today Jan 2015 https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/01/03/mexican-immigration-richard-miles/21056155/</ref>\n* The 2008\u20132012 [[global financial crisis| economic crisis of 2008]] has led to a decline of work opportunities in the U.S., meaning that many migrants who came to the U.S. for work couldn't find any. Access to social security, healthcare and education in the U.S. has also become more difficult.\n* The economic situation in Mexico has become better, ensuring better access to healthcare, education, and jobs. This reduces the incentive for Mexicans to leave the country.\n* Since 2010, U.S. legislation has placed stricter controls on illegal immigration: several American states have criminalized illegal immigration. Deportations under the Obama administration (2009-2017) reached record numbers.{{cn|date=February 2019}}\n* During the last few years, violence associated with drug cartels and organized crime has been on the rise in Northern Mexico, making the routes for passing the border more dangerous.\nMexicans and Americans Thinking Together (MATT) conducted 600 in-depth, in-person interviews of migrants who returned to the Mexican state of Jalisco, and found that family reasons and nostalgia are the primary cited reasons for return migration to Mexico. The research also found that of the interviewed migrants who moved back to Mexico, only about 11% were forced to leave the United States due to being deported. 75% of the respondents cited that their reasons for return migration were self-motivated.<ref>Mexicans and Americans Thinking Together (MATT)Quantitative Research Study Preliminary Findings and Insights The US/Mexico Cycle End of an Era http://www.matt.org/uploads/2/4/9/3/24932918/returnmigration_top_line_www.pdf Dec 2013</ref>\n\n===Developments in Mexico===\nMexican source communities, mostly indigenous villages, are most often poor. To survive economically, such areas rely heavily on the emigration of some of their members and on the remittances they send back. Emigration can function as an escape valve to alleviate economic pressures, as it provides a source of income and opens up work opportunities in villages of origin.<ref name=r2/> The return of many migrants thus causes great [[stress (disambiguation) | stress]] on these communities, who are heading for economic crisis as important sources of income fall away and more people become unemployed as there is less work available. The [[States of Mexico | states]] most affected by this phenomenon try to take action to help those who come back, but the full economic impact of the return of migrants is still to come.<ref name=r1/>\n\nWhile emigrants return to their (mostly poor) home communities, sending them into economic crisis, another migration phenomenon is accelerating: internal migration. The lack of work opportunities in small villages drives people to migrate to large cities, rather than to the U.S.  With 78% of the Mexican population living in urban zones, slums are growing fast.{{cn|date=February 2019}} Urban violence and crime, stunted growth, malnutrition, poor elementary education, poor hygiene and inadequate sanitation are just some of the implications of life in urban slums. According to [[UNICEF]], urban migration has badly worsened the reach of social schemes of health and nutrition.<ref>UNICEF, 2012. The State of the World's Children 2012, Executive Summary: Children in an Urban World. New York: United Nations Children's Fund.</ref>{{Full citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nAmong communities of origin, there is a widespread ambivalence towards migrants, as the money they send back is welcome, but there is resentment against the cultural changes that they bring with them when they come back. Returning migrants are blamed for bringing with them drug use, sexually-transmitted diseases, and antisocial behavior. They are held responsible for the abandonment of the traditional indigenous way of life as they bring back western cultural habits and material culture. The return of migrants to Mexico thus has important cultural repercussions and changes the face of their home communities forever.<ref name=r2>Fitzgerald, D., 2009.

This sector constitutes a non-negligible part of the U.S. economy. With the current migration trends, within a few years, Mexico will not be able to cover current demand for Mexican labor of its neighbor anymore. Migration from El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras to the U.S. is rising, as their migrants begin to replace Mexican workers. It is however unclear whether other [[Hispanic America]]n countries follow these trends, and it is unsure whether the gap left by returning Mexicans will be filled by such migrants. Experts{{which?|date=February 2019}} say the consequences for the U.S. economy may be important.<ref name=r1/>\n\nSince 2010, deportations of illegal immigrants have increased, as deportation procedures became more systematic and border controls were reinforced with police and military patrols. Several states, such as Arizona and Alabama, have passed laws that criminalize illegal migration.{{cn|date=February 2019}} Proposed acts that offer easier paths to U.S. citizenship for immigrants, such as the [[DREAM Act]], have been rejected.\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Mexico}}\n*[[Mexican Repatriation]], from US in 1930s\n*[[Immigration to Mexico]]\n*[[Foreign relations of Mexico]]\n*[[Demographics of Mexico]]\n\n==References==\n\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Mexican diaspora}}\n{{Mexico topics}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Emigration From Mexico}}\n[[Category:Demographics of Mexico]]\n[[Category:Emigration|Mexico]]\n[[Category:Mexican diaspora| ]]\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: \u2019s \u2192 's (3)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emigration_from_Mexico"}
