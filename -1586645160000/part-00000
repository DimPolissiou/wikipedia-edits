The field of players is smaller than those of the other major championships because it is an invitational event, held by the Augusta National Golf Club.\n\nThe tournament has a number of traditions. Since [[1949 Masters Tournament|1949]], a green jacket has been awarded to the champion, who must return it to the clubhouse one year after his victory, although it remains his personal property and is stored with other champions' jackets in a specially designated cloakroom. In most instances, only a first-time and currently reigning champion may remove his jacket from the club grounds. A golfer who wins the event multiple times uses the same green jacket awarded upon his initial win (unless he needs to be re-fitted with a new jacket).<ref>{{cite web |first=Brent |last=Kelley |title=Do Masters Champions Get to Keep the Green Jacket? |url=http://golf.about.com/od/majorchampionships/f/keep_jacket.htm |publisher=About.com}}</ref> The Champions Dinner, inaugurated by [[Ben Hogan]] in [[1952 Masters Tournament|1952]], is held on the Tuesday before each tournament, and is open only to past champions and certain board members of the Augusta National Golf Club. Beginning in [[1963 Masters Tournament|1963]], legendary golfers, usually past champions, have hit an honorary tee shot on the morning of the first round to commence play. These have included [[Fred McLeod]], [[Jock Hutchinson]], [[Gene Sarazen]], [[Sam Snead]], [[Byron Nelson]], [[Arnold Palmer]], [[Jack Nicklaus]], and [[Gary Player]]. Since [[1960 Masters Tournament|1960]], a [[Masters Tournament Par-3 contest|semi-social contest]] at the par-3 course has been played on Wednesday, the day before the first round.\n\nNicklaus has the most Masters wins, with six between 1963 and 1986. [[Tiger Woods]] has won five. Palmer has won four. Five have won three titles at Augusta: [[Jimmy Demaret]], [[Sam Snead]], [[Gary Player]], [[Nick Faldo]], and [[Phil Mickelson]]. Player, from [[South Africa]], was the first non-American player to win the tournament, in [[1961 Masters Tournament|1961]]; the second was [[Seve Ballesteros]] of [[Spain]], the champion in [[1980 Masters Tournament|1980]] and [[1983 Masters Tournament|1983]].\n\nThe Augusta National course first opened {{Years or months ago|1933}} in 1933 and has been modified many times by different architects. Among the changes: greens have been reshaped and, on occasion, entirely re-designed, bunkers have been added, water hazards have been extended, new tee boxes have been built, hundreds of trees have been planted, and several mounds have been installed.<ref name=\"Owen 1999\">{{cite book |title=The Making of the Masters: Clifford Roberts, Augusta National, and Golf's Most Prestigious Tournament |first=David |last=Owen |publisher=Simon & Schuster |year=1999 |isbn=978-0-684-85729-9}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:AugustaNationalMastersLogoFlowers.jpg|thumb|<center>Masters logo<br>at the club entrance</center>]]\n\n===Augusta National Golf Club===\n{{main|Augusta National Golf Club}}\nThe idea for Augusta National originated with [[Bobby Jones (golfer)|Bobby Jones]], who wanted to build a golf course after his retirement from the game.

The green sport coat is the official attire worn by members of Augusta National while on the club grounds; each Masters winner becomes an honorary member of the club. The recipient of the green jacket has it presented to him inside the Butler Cabin soon after the end of the tournament, and the presentation is then repeated outside near the 18th green in front of the patrons. Winners keep their jacket for the first year after their first victory, then return it to the club to wear whenever they visit. The tradition began in 1949, when Sam Snead won his first of three Masters titles.\n\nThe green jacket is only allowed to be removed from Augusta National by the reigning champion, after which it must remain at the club. Exceptions to this rule include Gary Player, who in his joy of winning mistakenly took his jacket home to South Africa after his 1961 victory (although he has always followed the spirit of the rule and has never worn the jacket);<ref>{{cite news |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=lukas/070405 |title=The real story behind the green jacket |last=Lukas |first=Paul |work=ESPN |accessdate=November 18, 2008}}</ref> [[Seve Ballesteros]] who, in an interview with [[Peter Alliss]] from his home in Pedre\u00f1a, showed one of his two green jackets in his trophy room; and [[Henry Picard]], whose jacket was removed from the club before the tradition was well established, remained in his closet for a number of years, and is now on display at Canterbury Golf Club in [[Beachwood, Ohio]], where he was the club professional for many years.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.si.com/vault/1995/04/10/8093250/master-teacher-nearly-forgotten-now-teaching-pro-henry-picard-was-a-big-star-when-he-won-the-1938-masters |title=Master Teacher: Nearly forgotten now, teaching pro Henry Picard was a big star when he won the 1938 Masters |first=Rick |last=Lispey |magazine=Sports Illustrated |accessdate=February 9, 2016 |date=April 10, 1995}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ohiogolfandtravelguide.com/ohio/golf-news/michael-kernicki-hosts-major-championship-at-canterbury-golf-club.html |title=Michael Kernicki hosts Major Championship at Canterbury Golf Club |publisher=GolfGuide.com |accessdate=April 10, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101111083303/http://www.ohiogolfandtravelguide.com/ohio/golf-news/michael-kernicki-hosts-major-championship-at-canterbury-golf-club.html |archivedate=November 11, 2010 }}</ref>\n\nBy tradition, the winner of the previous year's Masters Tournament puts the jacket on the current winner at the end of the tournament.

For each [[Eagle (golf)|eagle]] a player makes he receives a pair of crystal goblets.\n\nIn addition to the green jacket, winners of the tournament receive a gold medal. In 2017, a green jacket that was found at a thrift store in 1994 was sold at auction for $139,000.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.thestar.com/sports/golf/2017/04/10/masters-style-green-jacket-bought-for-5-at-toronto-thrift-store-sells-for-139k.html |title=Masters-style green jacket bought for $5 at Toronto thrift store sells for $139K |newspaper=Toronto Star |agency=Associated Press |date=April 10, 2017 |access-date=April 11, 2017}}</ref>\n\n====Trophies====\nWinners also have their names engraved on the actual silver Masters trophy.

In 1954, they began presenting an amateur silver medal to the low amateur runner-up.<ref name=\"Hist\"/>\n\nThe original trophy weighs over 130 pounds, and sits on a four-foot wide base. It resides permanently at Augusta National and depicts the clubhouse of the classic course. The replica, which is significantly smaller, stands just 6.5 inches tall and weighs 20 pounds. The champion and the runner-up both have their names engraved on the permanent trophy, solidifying themselves in golf history.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://thegolfnewsnet.com/golfnewsnetteam/2016/09/19/masters-trophy-facts-size-weight-history-97937 |title=The Masters Trophy facts: Size, weight, history and more |date=September 19, 2016 |website=GolfNewsNet.com}}</ref>\n\nThe Double Eagle trophy was introduced in 1967 when [[Bruce Devlin]] holed out for double eagle on number 8.

The event was established as part of an effort to help promote the sport of golf among youth; the winners of local qualifiers in different age groups advance to the national finals, which have been held at Augusta National on the Sunday immediately preceding the Masters. The driving and chipping portions of the event are held on the course's practice range, but the putting portion has been played on the course's 18th hole.<ref>{{Cite magazine |url=https://www.golfdigest.com/story/inaugural-drive-chip-and-putt |title=Inaugural Drive, Chip and Putt Championship has juniors living Augusta National dreams |last=Hennessey |first=Stephen |magazine=Golf Digest |date=April 4, 2014 |access-date=2018-04-08 |df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/golf/2013/04/08/masters-augusta-national-drive-chip-and-putt-contest/2064565/ |title=Masters unveils drive, chip and putt contest |newspaper=USA Today |agency=Associated Press |date=April 8, 2013 |access-date=2018-04-08 |df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.espn.com/golf/story/_/id/22996264/drive-chip-putt-winners-crowned-augusta-national-ahead-masters |title=Drive, Chip & Putt winners crowned at Augusta |work=ESPN |first=Bob |last=Harig |date=Apr 1, 2018 |access-date=2018-04-08 |df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nOn April 4, 2018, prior to the 2018 tournament, new Augusta National chairman [[Fred Ridley]] announced that the club would host the [[Augusta National Women's Amateur]] beginning in 2019. The first two rounds will be held at the Champion's Retreat club in [[Evans, Georgia]], with the final two rounds hosted by Augusta National (the final round will take place on the Saturday directly preceding the tournament). Ridley stated that holding such an event at Augusta National would have the \"greatest impact\" on women's golf. Although concerns were raised that the event would conflict with the [[LPGA Tour]]'s [[ANA Inspiration]] (which has invited top amateur players to compete), Ridley stated that he had discussed the event with commissioner [[Mike Whan]], and stated that he agreed on the notion that any move to bolster the prominence of women's golf would be a \"win\" for the LPGA over time.

It invites winners of the most prestigious amateur tournaments in the world. Also, the current [[U.S. Amateur]] champion always plays in the same group as the defending Masters champion for the first two days of the tournament.\n\nAmateurs in the field are welcome to stay in the \"Crow's Nest\" atop the Augusta National clubhouse during the tournament. The Crow's Nest is {{convert|1200|sqft|-1}} with lodging space for five during the competition.\n\n===Opening tee shot===\nSince 1963, the custom in most years has been to start the tournament with an honorary opening tee shot at the first hole, typically by one or more legendary players. The original honorary starters were [[Jock Hutchison]] and [[Fred McLeod]]; this twosome led off every tournament from 1963 until 1973, when poor health prevented Hutchison from swinging a club. McLeod continued on until his death in 1976. Byron Nelson and Gene Sarazen started in 1981, and were then joined by Sam Snead in 1984. This trio continued until 1999 when Sarazen died, while Nelson stopped in 2001. Snead hit his final opening tee shot in 2002, a little over a month before he died.\n\nIn 2007, Arnold Palmer took over as the honorary starter.

In 1997, 1979 champion [[Fuzzy Zoeller]] created a media storm when he suggested that Tiger Woods refrain from serving collard greens and fried chicken, dishes commonly associated with Afro-American culture, at the dinner.

Since [[1948 Masters Tournament|1948]], its final round has been scheduled for the second Sunday of April, with several exceptions. It ended on the first Sunday four times ([[1952 Masters Tournament|1952]], [[1957 Masters Tournament|1957]], [[1958 Masters Tournament|1958]], [[1959 Masters Tournament|1959]]) and the [[1979 Masters Tournament|1979]] and [[1984 Masters Tournament|1984]] tournaments ended on April 15, the month's third Sunday.<ref name=\"Hist\"/> The first edition in [[1934 Masters Tournament|1934]] was held in late March and the next ten were in early April, with only the [[1942 Masters Tournament|1942]] event scheduled to end on the second Sunday.  The [[2020 Masters Tournament|2020]] event, postponed by the [[COVID-19]] pandemic, is slated to be held in the autumn, with it being the last major of the year.\n\nSimilar to the other majors, the tournament consists of four rounds at 18 holes each, Thursday through Sunday (when there are no delays). The Masters has a relatively small field of contenders, when compared with other golf tournaments, so the competitors play in groups of three for the first two rounds (36 holes) and the field is not split to start on the 1st and 10th tees, unless weather shortens the available playing time, such as the second round in 1983, fourth round in 2019, and is expected for all four rounds in 2020. The tournament is unique in that it is the only major tournament conducted by a private club rather than a national golf organization like the PGA.<ref name=\"Owen 1999\" />\n\nOriginally, the Masters was the only tournament to use two-man pairings during the first two rounds. It was also the only event to re-pair based on the leaderboard before Friday's round, as most tournaments only do this on the weekend. This practice ended in the early 2000s, when the Masters switched to the more standard three-man groups and the groups are now kept intact on Friday, with players sharing the same playing partners in both of the first two rounds.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nAfter 36 holes of play, a cut-off score is calculated to reduce the size of the field for the weekend rounds. To \"make the cut\", players must be either in the top 50 places (ties counting), or within 10 strokes of the leader's score. These criteria have applied since [[2013 Masters Tournament|2013]].<ref name=cut>{{cite news |url=http://espn.go.com/golf/masters13/story/_/id/9156060/fall-tour-event-winners-get-masters-spot |title=Masters tweaks qualifications |first=Bob |last=Harig |work=ESPN |date=April 10, 2013 |access-date=April 16, 2013}}</ref> From 1957 to 1960, the top 40 scores (including ties) and those within 10 strokes of the leader made the cut. From 1961 to 2012, it was the top 44 (and ties) or within 10 strokes of the lead.<ref name=cut/> Before [[1957 Masters Tournament|1957]], there was no 36-hole cut and all of the invitees played four rounds, if desired.<ref name=\"Cut\">{{cite web |url=http://www.masters.org/en_US/history/records/cutinfo.html |title=Cut Information |publisher=www.masters.org |access-date=January 21, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080119025225/http://www.masters.org/en_US/history/records/cutinfo.html |archivedate=January 19, 2008}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the cut, an additional 36 holes are played over the final two days. Should the fourth round fail to produce a winner, all players tied for the lead enter a [[Sudden death (sport)#Golf|sudden-death]] playoff. Play begins on the 18th hole, followed by the adjacent 10th, repeating until one player remains.

Earlier playoffs were 18 holes on the following day, except for the first in [[1935 Masters Tournament|1935]], which was 36 holes; the last 18-hole playoff was in [[1970 Masters Tournament|1970]], and none of the full-round playoffs went to additional holes.\n\n==Course==\nThe golf course was formerly a [[plant nursery]] and each hole is named after the tree or shrub with which it has become associated.<ref name=nursbeaut/><br>\nThe course layout in [[2019 Masters Tournament|2019]]:\n{|class=wikitable style=\"text-align: center\"\n|-\n!Hole!!Name!!Yards!!Par!! !!Hole!!Name!!Yards!!Par\n|-\n|1||align=left|[[Tea Olive]]||445||4||rowspan=10| ||10||align=left|[[Camellia]]||495||4\n|-\n|2||align=left|[[Flowering dogwood|Pink Dogwood]]||575||5||11||align=left|[[White Dogwood]]||505||4\n|-\n|3||align=left|[[Peach|Flowering Peach]]||350||4||12||align=left|[[Forsythia|Golden Bell]]||155||3\n|-\n|4||align=left|[[Malus|Flowering Crab Apple]]||240||3||13||align=left|[[Azalea]]||510||5\n|-\n|5||align=left|[[Southern magnolia|Magnolia]]||495||4||14||align=left|[[Cunninghamia|Chinese Fir]]||440||4\n|-\n|6||align=left|[[Eastern Juniper|Juniper]]||180||3||15||align=left|[[Pyracantha|Firethorn]]||530||5\n|-\n|7||align=left|[[Cortaderia selloana|Pampas]]||450||4||16||align=left|[[Eastern Redbud|Redbud]]||170||3\n|-\n|8||align=left|[[Yellow Jessamine|Yellow Jasmine]]||570||5||17||align=left|[[Nandina]]||440||4\n|-\n|9||align=left|[[Prunus caroliniana|Carolina Cherry]]||460||4||18||align=left|[[American holly|Holly]]||465||4\n|-\n| colspan=2|'''Out'''||'''3,765'''||'''36'''|| colspan=2|'''In'''||'''3,710'''||'''36'''\n|-\n| colspan=\"5\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|<small>Source:</small><ref name=itcpgat11/><ref name=2012cstour>{{cite web|url=http://www.majorschampionships.com/masters/2012/course/tour/index.cfm |publisher=PGA of America: Major Championships |title=Course Tour: 2012 Masters |accessdate=August 24, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120827230002/http://www.majorschampionships.com/masters/2012/course/tour/index.cfm |archivedate=August 27, 2012 }}</ref>||colspan=2|'''Total'''||'''7,475'''||'''72'''\n|}\n\nLengths of the course for the Masters at the start of each decade:\n{|\n|\n* [[2010 Masters Tournament|2010]]: {{convert|7435|yd}}\n* [[2000 Masters Tournament|2000]]: {{convert|6985|yd}}\n* [[1990 Masters Tournament|1990]]: {{convert|6905|yd}}\n* [[1980 Masters Tournament|1980]]: {{convert|7040|yd|0}}\n|\n* [[1970 Masters Tournament|1970]]: {{convert|6980|yd|0}}\n* [[1960 Masters Tournament|1960]]: {{convert|6980|yd|0}}\n* [[1950 Masters Tournament|1950]]: {{convert|6900|yd|0}}\n* [[1940 Masters Tournament|1940]]: {{convert|6800|yd|0}}<ref name=itcpgat11/>\n|}\nThe course was lengthened to {{convert|7445|yd}} in [[2006 Masters Tournament|2006]].

Since [[1949 Masters Tournament|1949]], a green jacket has been awarded to the champion, who must return it to the clubhouse one year after his victory, although it remains his personal property and is stored with other champions' jackets in a specially designated cloakroom. In most instances, only a first-time and currently reigning champion may remove his jacket from the club grounds. A golfer who wins the event multiple times uses the same green jacket awarded upon his initial win (unless he needs to be re-fitted with a new jacket).<ref>{{cite web |first=Brent |last=Kelley |title=Do Masters Champions Get to Keep the Green Jacket? |url=http://golf.about.com/od/majorchampionships/f/keep_jacket.htm |publisher=About.com}}</ref> The Champions Dinner, inaugurated by [[Ben Hogan]] in [[1952 Masters Tournament|1952]], is held on the Tuesday before each tournament, and is open only to past champions and certain board members of the Augusta National Golf Club. Beginning in [[1963 Masters Tournament|1963]], legendary golfers, usually past champions, have hit an honorary tee shot on the morning of the first round to commence play. These have included [[Fred McLeod]], [[Jock Hutchinson]], [[Gene Sarazen]], [[Sam Snead]], [[Byron Nelson]], [[Arnold Palmer]], [[Jack Nicklaus]], and [[Gary Player]]. Since [[1960 Masters Tournament|1960]], a [[Masters Tournament Par-3 contest|semi-social contest]] at the par-3 course has been played on Wednesday, the day before the first round.\n\nNicklaus has the most Masters wins, with six between 1963 and 1986. [[Tiger Woods]] has won five. Palmer has won four. Five have won three titles at Augusta: [[Jimmy Demaret]], [[Sam Snead]], [[Gary Player]], [[Nick Faldo]], and [[Phil Mickelson]]. Player, from [[South Africa]], was the first non-American player to win the tournament, in [[1961 Masters Tournament|1961]]; the second was [[Seve Ballesteros]] of [[Spain]], the champion in [[1980 Masters Tournament|1980]] and [[1983 Masters Tournament|1983]].\n\nThe Augusta National course first opened {{Years or months ago|1933}} in 1933 and has been modified many times by different architects. Among the changes: greens have been reshaped and, on occasion, entirely re-designed, bunkers have been added, water hazards have been extended, new tee boxes have been built, hundreds of trees have been planted, and several mounds have been installed.<ref name=\"Owen 1999\">{{cite book |title=The Making of the Masters: Clifford Roberts, Augusta National, and Golf's Most Prestigious Tournament |first=David |last=Owen |publisher=Simon & Schuster |year=1999 |isbn=978-0-684-85729-9}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:AugustaNationalMastersLogoFlowers.jpg|thumb|<center>Masters logo<br>at the club entrance</center>]]\n\n===Augusta National Golf Club===\n{{main|Augusta National Golf Club}}\nThe idea for Augusta National originated with [[Bobby Jones (golfer)|Bobby Jones]], who wanted to build a golf course after his retirement from the game.

Argentine champion [[Roberto De Vicenzo]] signed his scorecard (attested by playing partner [[Tommy Aaron]]) incorrectly recording him as making a par 4 instead of a birdie 3 on the 17th hole of the final round.

The recipient of the green jacket has it presented to him inside the Butler Cabin soon after the end of the tournament, and the presentation is then repeated outside near the 18th green in front of the patrons. Winners keep their jacket for the first year after their first victory, then return it to the club to wear whenever they visit. The tradition began in 1949, when Sam Snead won his first of three Masters titles.\n\nThe green jacket is only allowed to be removed from Augusta National by the reigning champion, after which it must remain at the club.

In 1997, 1979 champion [[Fuzzy Zoeller]] created a media storm when he suggested that Tiger Woods refrain from serving collard greens and fried chicken, dishes commonly associated with Afro-American culture, at the dinner. The 2011 dinner of [[Phil Mickelson]] was a Spanish-themed menu in hopes that [[Seve Ballesteros]] would attend, but he was too sick to attend and died  weeks later.<ref>[http://www.golf.com/tour-news/2017/03/15/masters-champions-dinner-everything-you-need-know Masters Champions Dinner: Everything you need to know]</ref>\n\n===Caddies===\nUntil [[1983 Masters Tournament|1983]], all players in the Masters were required to use the services of an Augusta National Club [[caddie]],<ref name=trcdatag>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=WFcaAAAAIBAJ&sjid=yiQEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6177%2C1789683 |newspaper=Times-News |location=Hendersonville, North Carolina |title=Tour caddies at Augusta? |date=November 12, 1982 |page=14}}</ref><ref name=alctrbgd>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=3LUSAAAAIBAJ&sjid=mvkDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6774%2C1068214 |newspaper=Spokane Chronicle |location=Washington |last=Wade |first=Harless |title=Tradition bagged at Masters |date=April 6, 1983 |page=C1}}</ref><ref name=mcadcol>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=xMksAAAAIBAJ&sjid=chMEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6823%2C3348928 |newspaper=Sunday Star-News |location=Wilmington, North Carolina |last=Anderson |first=Dave |authorlink=Dave Anderson (sportswriter) |title=New Masters caddies collide |date=April 10, 1983 |page=6D}}</ref> who by club tradition was always an African American man.<ref name=\"nyt1990\"/> Indeed, club co-founder Clifford Roberts is reputed to have said, \"As long as I'm alive, golfers will be white, and caddies will be black.\"<ref>{{cite magazine |first=Rick |last=Reilly |authorlink=Rick Reilly |url=https://www.si.com/vault/1997/04/21/225867/strokes-of-genius-overpowering-a-storied-course-and-a-stellar-field-tiger-woods-heralded-a-new-era-in-golf-with-an-awesome-12-shot-victory-in-the-masters |title=Strokes of Genius |date=April 21, 1997 |accessdate=February 9, 2016 |magazine=Sports Illustrated}}</ref> Since 1983\u2014six years after Roberts's death in 1977\u2014players have been allowed the option of bringing their own caddie to the tournament.\n\nThe Masters requires caddies to wear a uniform consisting of a white jumpsuit, a green Masters cap, and white tennis shoes.

Since [[1948 Masters Tournament|1948]], its final round has been scheduled for the second Sunday of April, with several exceptions. It ended on the first Sunday four times ([[1952 Masters Tournament|1952]], [[1957 Masters Tournament|1957]], [[1958 Masters Tournament|1958]], [[1959 Masters Tournament|1959]]) and the [[1979 Masters Tournament|1979]] and [[1984 Masters Tournament|1984]] tournaments ended on April 15, the month's third Sunday.<ref name=\"Hist\"/> The first edition in [[1934 Masters Tournament|1934]] was held in late March and the next ten were in early April, with only the [[1942 Masters Tournament|1942]] event scheduled to end on the second Sunday.  The [[2020 Masters Tournament|2020]] event, postponed by the [[COVID-19]] pandemic, is slated to be held in the autumn, with it being the last major of the year.\n\nSimilar to the other majors, the tournament consists of four rounds at 18 holes each, Thursday through Sunday (when there are no delays). The Masters has a relatively small field of contenders, when compared with other golf tournaments, so the competitors play in groups of three for the first two rounds (36 holes) and the field is not split to start on the 1st and 10th tees, unless weather shortens the available playing time, such as the second round in 1983, fourth round in 2019, and is expected for all four rounds in 2020. The tournament is unique in that it is the only major tournament conducted by a private club rather than a national golf organization like the PGA.<ref name=\"Owen 1999\" />\n\nOriginally, the Masters was the only tournament to use two-man pairings during the first two rounds. It was also the only event to re-pair based on the leaderboard before Friday's round, as most tournaments only do this on the weekend. This practice ended in the early 2000s, when the Masters switched to the more standard three-man groups and the groups are now kept intact on Friday, with players sharing the same playing partners in both of the first two rounds.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nAfter 36 holes of play, a cut-off score is calculated to reduce the size of the field for the weekend rounds. To \"make the cut\", players must be either in the top 50 places (ties counting), or within 10 strokes of the leader's score. These criteria have applied since [[2013 Masters Tournament|2013]].<ref name=cut>{{cite news |url=http://espn.go.com/golf/masters13/story/_/id/9156060/fall-tour-event-winners-get-masters-spot |title=Masters tweaks qualifications |first=Bob |last=Harig |work=ESPN |date=April 10, 2013 |access-date=April 16, 2013}}</ref> From 1957 to 1960, the top 40 scores (including ties) and those within 10 strokes of the leader made the cut. From 1961 to 2012, it was the top 44 (and ties) or within 10 strokes of the lead.<ref name=cut/> Before [[1957 Masters Tournament|1957]], there was no 36-hole cut and all of the invitees played four rounds, if desired.<ref name=\"Cut\">{{cite web |url=http://www.masters.org/en_US/history/records/cutinfo.html |title=Cut Information |publisher=www.masters.org |access-date=January 21, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080119025225/http://www.masters.org/en_US/history/records/cutinfo.html |archivedate=January 19, 2008}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the cut, an additional 36 holes are played over the final two days. Should the fourth round fail to produce a winner, all players tied for the lead enter a [[Sudden death (sport)#Golf|sudden-death]] playoff. Play begins on the 18th hole, followed by the adjacent 10th, repeating until one player remains.

It was reopened in 2000 and subsequently closed once again.

When used fresh, they are most often prepared and eaten like a vegetable. Whole pods can be dried and then crushed or ground into [[chili powder]] that is used as a spice or seasoning. Chilies can be dried to prolong their shelf life. Chile peppers can also be preserved by brining, immersing the pods in oil, or by [[pickling]].\n[[File:Tinolang Manok.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Filipino cuisine|Filipino]] ''[[tinola]]'' chicken soup with ''[[labuyo]]'' chili leaves]]\n[[File:Chilly ap.JPG|thumb|Chilies at a market in [[India]]]]\n[[File:Shrimp.paste-Sambal.Belacan-01.jpg|thumb|''[[Sambal]]'' is the name for chili paste in [[Indonesian cuisine|Indonesian]], [[Malaysian cuisine|Malaysian]] and [[Singaporean cuisine]]]]\n[[File:Thai curry paste at the market so good I brought some home (3195324838).jpg|thumb|[[Thai curry]] pastes contain large amounts of chilies]]\n\nMany fresh chilies such as [[poblano]] have a tough outer skin that does not break down on cooking. Chilies are sometimes used whole or in large slices, by [[roasting]], or other means of blistering or charring the skin, so as not to entirely cook the flesh beneath. When cooled, the skins will usually slip off easily.\n\nThe leaves of every species of Capsicum are edible. Though almost all other [[Solanaceae|Solanaceous]] crops have toxins in their leaves, chili peppers do not.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} The leaves, which are mildly bitter and nowhere near as hot as the fruit, are cooked as [[Leaf vegetable|greens]] in Filipino cuisine, where they are called ''dahon ng sili'' (literally \"chili leaves\"). They are used in the chicken soup ''[[tinola]]''.<ref>[http://www.tribo.org/vegetables/dahongsili.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312093900/http://www.tribo.org/vegetables/dahongsili.html|date=12 March 2007}}</ref> In Korean cuisine, the leaves may be used in [[kimchi]].<ref>[http://sfood.info/cuisine/kimchi/k35.htm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091114231725/http://sfood.info/cuisine/kimchi/k35.htm|date=14 November 2009}}</ref> In Japanese cuisine, the leaves are cooked as greens, and also cooked in ''[[tsukudani]]'' style for preservation.\n\nMany [[Mexican cuisine|Mexican dishes]], including variations on [[chiles rellenos]], use the entire chili. Dried whole chilies may be reconstituted before grinding to a paste. The [[chipotle]] is the smoked, dried, ripe [[jalape\u00f1o]]. In the northern Mexican states of [[Sinaloa]] and [[Sonora]], [[chiltepin pepper]]s (a wild pepper) are used in cheeses and soups to add spiciness to dishes. In southern Mexico, [[mole sauce]] is used with dried chiles, such as [[poblano|ancho]] and chipotle peppers. Chiles are used in [[salsa (sauce)|salsas]]. Mexican households usually grow chile plants to use in cooking.\n\nIn India, most households always keep a stock of fresh hot green chilies at hand, and use them to flavor most curries and dry dishes. It is typically lightly fried with oil in the initial stages of preparation of the dish. Some states in India, such as Rajasthan, make entire dishes only by using spices and chilies.{{Citation needed|reason=Give an example of such a dish.|date=July 2017}}\n\nChili is a staple fruit in Bhutan. Bhutanese call this crop ''ema'' (in Dzongkha) or ''solo'' (in Sharchop). The ''ema'' datsi recipe is entirely made of chili mixed with local cheese.\n\nChilies are present in many cuisines.  Some notable dishes other than the ones mentioned elsewhere in this article include:\n*[[Arrabbiata sauce|Arrabbiata]] sauce from Italy is a tomato-based sauce for pasta always including dried hot chilies.\n*[[Spaghetti alla puttanesca|Puttanesca]] sauce is tomato-based with olives, capers, anchovy and, sometimes, chilies.\n*[[Goulash|Paprikash]] from Hungary uses significant amounts of mild, ground, dried chilies, known as [[paprika]], in a braised chicken dish.\n*[[Chiles en nogada]] from the [[Puebla]] region of Mexico uses fresh mild chilies stuffed with meat and covered with a creamy nut-thickened sauce.\n*[[Curry]] dishes usually contain fresh or dried chiles.\n*Jambalaya is Cajun dish where the flavors of chicken, shrimp, and Andouille sausages are enhanced by Cayenne pepper. Jambalaya is also sometimes served with a regional hot sauce made from Tabasco peppers.\n*Jerk Chicken is prepared in the Caribbean region of Jamaica, the flavor of the dish owing to Scotch Bonnet Chiles, Allspice, and Thyme.\n*[[Kung pao chicken]] ([[Mandarin Chinese]]: \u5bab\u4fdd\u9e21\u4e01 ''g\u014dng b\u01ceo j\u012b d\u012bng'') from the [[Sichuan]] region of China uses small hot dried chilies briefly fried in oil to add spice to the oil then used for frying.\n*[[Mole poblano]] from the city of [[Puebla]] in Mexico uses several varieties of dried chilies, nuts, spices, and fruits to produce a thick, dark sauce for poultry or other meats.\n*[[Nam phrik]] are traditional Thai chili pastes and sauces, prepared with chopped fresh or dry chilies, and additional ingredients such as [[fish sauce]], [[Lime (fruit)|lime]] juice, and herbs, but also fruit, meat or seafood.\n*[['Nduja]], a more typical example of Italian spicy specialty, from the region of Calabria, is a soft pork sausage made \"hot\" by the addition of the locally grown variety of jalape\u00f1o chili.\n*[[Paprykarz szczeci\u0144ski]] is a Polish fish paste with rice, onion, tomato concentrate, vegetable oil, chili pepper powder and other spices.\n*Pip\u00e9rade is a dish from the Basque region of France that incorporates Piment d\u2019Espelette into the recipe.\n*''[[Sambal]] [[terasi]]'' or ''sambal [[belacan]]'' is a traditional [[Indonesian cuisine|Indonesian]] and Malay hot condiment made by frying a mixture of mainly pounded dried chili s, with garlic, shallots, and fermented [[shrimp paste]]. It is customarily served with rice dishes and is especially popular when mixed with crunchy pan-roasted ''ikan teri'' or ''ikan bilis'' (sun-dried anchovies), when it is known as ''sambal teri'' or ''sambal ikan bilis''. Various ''sambal'' variants existed in Indonesian archipelago, among others are ''sambal badjak'', ''sambal oelek'', ''sambal pete'' (prepared with [[Parkia speciosa|green stinky beans]]) and ''sambal pencit'' (prepared with unripe green mango).\n*[[Som tam]], a green papaya salad from [[Thai cuisine|Thai]] and [[Lao people|Lao]] cuisine, traditionally has, as a key ingredient, a fistful of chopped fresh hot Thai chili, pounded in a mortar.\n*Tavuk Kebabi uses mint and  Aleppo pepper as a marinade that imparts flavor to skewered pieces of chicken which are grilled before serving.\n\nFresh or dried chilies are often used to make [[hot sauce]], a liquid [[condiment]]\u2014usually bottled when commercially available\u2014that adds spice to other dishes. Hot sauces are found in many cuisines including [[harissa]] from North Africa, [[chili oil]] from China (known as r\u0101yu in Japan), and [[sriracha sauce|sriracha]] from Thailand.

Farmers have found the use of chilies effective in crop defense against elephants. Elephants do not like capsaicin, the chemical in capsicum chilies that makes them hot.  Because the elephants have a large and sensitive [[Olfaction|olfactory]] and nasal system, the smell of the chili causes them discomfort and deters them from feeding on the crops. By planting a few rows of the [[Pungency|pungent]] fruit around valuable crops, farmers create a buffer zone through which the elephants are reluctant to pass. Chili dung bombs are also used for this purpose. They are bricks made of mixing dung and chili, and are burned, creating a noxious smoke that keeps hungry elephants out of farmers' fields. This can lessen dangerous physical confrontation between people and elephants.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Mott|first=Maryann|title=Elephant Crop Raids Foiled by Chili Peppers, Africa Project Finds|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.co.in/news/2006/09/060918-elephants-chili.html|magazine=National Geographic|accessdate=23 October 2013|date=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029194226/http://news.nationalgeographic.co.in/news/2006/09/060918-elephants-chili.html|archive-date=29 October 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n=== Food defense ===\n\nBirds do not have the same sensitivity to capsaicin, because it targets a specific [[Nociceptors|pain receptor]] in mammals.

When used fresh, they are most often prepared and eaten like a vegetable. Whole pods can be dried and then crushed or ground into [[chili powder]] that is used as a spice or seasoning. Chilies can be dried to prolong their shelf life. Chile peppers can also be preserved by brining, immersing the pods in oil, or by [[pickling]].\n[[File:Tinolang Manok.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Filipino cuisine|Filipino]] ''[[tinola]]'' chicken soup with ''[[labuyo]]'' chili leaves]]\n[[File:Chilly ap.JPG|thumb|Chilies at a market in [[India]]]]\n[[File:Shrimp.paste-Sambal.Belacan-01.jpg|thumb|''[[Sambal]]'' is the name for chili paste in [[Indonesian cuisine|Indonesian]], [[Malaysian cuisine|Malaysian]] and [[Singaporean cuisine]]]]\n[[File:Thai curry paste at the market so good I brought some home (3195324838).jpg|thumb|[[Thai curry]] pastes contain large amounts of chilies]]\n\nMany fresh chilies such as [[poblano]] have a tough outer skin that does not break down on cooking. Chilies are sometimes used whole or in large slices, by [[roasting]], or other means of blistering or charring the skin, so as not to entirely cook the flesh beneath. When cooled, the skins will usually slip off easily.\n\nThe leaves of every species of Capsicum are edible. Though almost all other [[Solanaceae|Solanaceous]] crops have toxins in their leaves, chili peppers do not.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} The leaves, which are mildly bitter and nowhere near as hot as the fruit, are cooked as [[Leaf vegetable|greens]] in Filipino cuisine, where they are called ''dahon ng sili'' (literally \"chili leaves\"). They are used in the chicken soup ''[[tinola]]''.<ref>[http://www.tribo.org/vegetables/dahongsili.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312093900/http://www.tribo.org/vegetables/dahongsili.html|date=12 March 2007}}</ref> In Korean cuisine, the leaves may be used in [[kimchi]].<ref>[http://sfood.info/cuisine/kimchi/k35.htm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091114231725/http://sfood.info/cuisine/kimchi/k35.htm|date=14 November 2009}}</ref> In Japanese cuisine, the leaves are cooked as greens, and also cooked in ''[[tsukudani]]'' style for preservation.\n\nMany [[Mexican cuisine|Mexican dishes]], including variations on [[chiles rellenos]], use the entire chili. Dried whole chilies may be reconstituted before grinding to a paste. The [[chipotle]] is the smoked, dried, ripe [[jalape\u00f1o]]. In the northern Mexican states of [[Sinaloa]] and [[Sonora]], [[chiltepin pepper]]s (a wild pepper) are used in cheeses and soups to add spiciness to dishes. In southern Mexico, [[mole sauce]] is used with dried chiles, such as [[poblano|ancho]] and chipotle peppers. Chiles are used in [[salsa (sauce)|salsas]]. Mexican households usually grow chile plants to use in cooking.\n\nIn India, most households always keep a stock of fresh hot green chilies at hand, and use them to flavor most curries and dry dishes. It is typically lightly fried with oil in the initial stages of preparation of the dish. Some states in India, such as Rajasthan, make entire dishes only by using spices and chilies.{{Citation needed|reason=Give an example of such a dish.|date=July 2017}}\n\nChili is a staple fruit in Bhutan. Bhutanese call this crop ''ema'' (in Dzongkha) or ''solo'' (in Sharchop). The ''ema'' datsi recipe is entirely made of chili mixed with local cheese.\n\nChilies are present in many cuisines.  Some notable dishes other than the ones mentioned elsewhere in this article include:\n*[[Arrabbiata sauce|Arrabbiata]] sauce from Italy is a tomato-based sauce for pasta always including dried hot chilies.\n*[[Spaghetti alla puttanesca|Puttanesca]] sauce is tomato-based with olives, capers, anchovy and, sometimes, chilies.\n*[[Goulash|Paprikash]] from Hungary uses significant amounts of mild, ground, dried chilies, known as [[paprika]], in a braised chicken dish.\n*[[Chiles en nogada]] from the [[Puebla]] region of Mexico uses fresh mild chilies stuffed with meat and covered with a creamy nut-thickened sauce.\n*[[Curry]] dishes usually contain fresh or dried chiles.\n*Jambalaya is Cajun dish where the flavors of chicken, shrimp, and Andouille sausages are enhanced by Cayenne pepper. Jambalaya is also sometimes served with a regional hot sauce made from Tabasco peppers.\n*Jerk Chicken is prepared in the Caribbean region of Jamaica, the flavor of the dish owing to Scotch Bonnet Chiles, Allspice, and Thyme.\n*[[Kung pao chicken]] ([[Mandarin Chinese]]: \u5bab\u4fdd\u9e21\u4e01 ''g\u014dng b\u01ceo j\u012b d\u012bng'') from the [[Sichuan]] region of China uses small hot dried chilies briefly fried in oil to add spice to the oil then used for frying.\n*[[Mole poblano]] from the city of [[Puebla]] in Mexico uses several varieties of dried chilies, nuts, spices, and fruits to produce a thick, dark sauce for poultry or other meats.\n*[[Nam phrik]] are traditional Thai chili pastes and sauces, prepared with chopped fresh or dry chilies, and additional ingredients such as [[fish sauce]], [[Lime (fruit)|lime]] juice, and herbs, but also fruit, meat or seafood.\n*[['Nduja]], a more typical example of Italian spicy specialty, from the region of Calabria, is a soft pork sausage made \"hot\" by the addition of the locally grown variety of jalape\u00f1o chili.\n*[[Paprykarz szczeci\u0144ski]] is a Polish fish paste with rice, onion, tomato concentrate, vegetable oil, chili pepper powder and other spices.\n*Pip\u00e9rade is a dish from the Basque region of France that incorporates Piment d\u2019Espelette into the recipe.\n*''[[Sambal]] [[terasi]]'' or ''sambal [[belacan]]'' is a traditional [[Indonesian cuisine|Indonesian]] and Malay hot condiment made by frying a mixture of mainly pounded dried chili s, with garlic, shallots, and fermented [[shrimp paste]]. It is customarily served with rice dishes and is especially popular when mixed with crunchy pan-roasted ''ikan teri'' or ''ikan bilis'' (sun-dried anchovies), when it is known as ''sambal teri'' or ''sambal ikan bilis''. Various ''sambal'' variants existed in Indonesian archipelago, among others are ''sambal badjak'', ''sambal oelek'', ''sambal pete'' (prepared with [[Parkia speciosa|green stinky beans]]) and ''sambal pencit'' (prepared with unripe green mango).\n*[[Som tam]], a green papaya salad from [[Thai cuisine|Thai]] and [[Lao people|Lao]] cuisine, traditionally has, as a key ingredient, a fistful of chopped fresh hot Thai chili, pounded in a mortar.\n*Tavuk Kebabi uses mint and  Aleppo pepper as a marinade that imparts flavor to skewered pieces of chicken which are grilled before serving.\n\nFresh or dried chilies are often used to make [[hot sauce]], a liquid [[condiment]]\u2014usually bottled when commercially available\u2014that adds spice to other dishes. Hot sauces are found in many cuisines including [[harissa]] from North Africa, [[chili oil]] from China (known as r\u0101yu in Japan), and [[sriracha sauce|sriracha]] from Thailand.

Farmers have found the use of chilies effective in crop defense against elephants. Elephants do not like capsaicin, the chemical in capsicum chilies that makes them hot.  Because the elephants have a large and sensitive [[Olfaction|olfactory]] and nasal system, the smell of the chili causes them discomfort and deters them from feeding on the crops. By planting a few rows of the [[Pungency|pungent]] fruit around valuable crops, farmers create a buffer zone through which the elephants are reluctant to pass. Chili dung bombs are also used for this purpose. They are bricks made of mixing dung and chili, and are burned, creating a noxious smoke that keeps hungry elephants out of farmers' fields. This can lessen dangerous physical confrontation between people and elephants.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Mott|first=Maryann|title=Elephant Crop Raids Foiled by Chili Peppers, Africa Project Finds|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.co.in/news/2006/09/060918-elephants-chili.html|magazine=National Geographic|accessdate=23 October 2013|date=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029194226/http://news.nationalgeographic.co.in/news/2006/09/060918-elephants-chili.html|archive-date=29 October 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n=== Food defense ===\n\nBirds do not have the same sensitivity to capsaicin, because it targets a specific [[Nociceptors|pain receptor]] in mammals.

It was released on March 23, 1999, from Martin's [[Ricky Martin (1999 album)|self-titled]] debut English-language album (he had previously released several albums in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]). The song was composed by [[Desmond Child]] and [[Draco Rosa]]. ''La vida loca'' is Spanish for \"the crazy life.\"\n\n\"Livin' la Vida Loca\" is generally seen as the song that began the [[Latin pop]] explosion that followed and made the transition of other Spanish-speaking artists (first [[Enrique Iglesias]] and [[Marc Anthony]] and later [[Shakira]], [[Paulina Rubio]] and [[Thal\u00eda]]) into the English-speaking market easier. Before this time, most non-Latino Americans had never heard of Martin until what [[CNN]] reported was a show-stopping performance of \"[[La Copa de la Vida]]\" at the [[41st Grammy Awards]] show, which became a catalyst in bringing Latin pop to the forefront of the U.S. music scene.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/SHOWBIZ/Music/9905/17/latin.music/|title=CNN - Ricky Martin leading the Latin (music) revolution - May 17, 1999|website=www.cnn.com}}</ref> \"Livin' la Vida Loca\" sold over 8 million copies, making it one of the [[List of best-selling singles|best selling singles]] of all time.\n\nThe song received various [[Grammy Award]]s nominations and Ricky Martin obtained enormous success inside the United States and worldwide. In 2007, the song was ranked at number 28 on the list of 100 Greatest Songs of the 90s by [[VH1]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rockonthenet.com/archive/2007/vh190s.htm|title=Rock On The Net: VH1: 100 Greatest Songs of the '90s: 1-50|website=www.rockonthenet.com}}</ref> It is Martin's [[signature song]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nMartin performed the song on [[The Voice (Australia series 2)|second series]] of ''[[The Voice (Australian TV series)|The Voice Australia]]'' with fellow judges [[Delta Goodrem]], [[Joel Madden]] and [[Seal (musician)|Seal]].\n\n==Recording==\n{{Listen\n|filename=Ricky Martin Livin La Vida Loca.ogg\n|title=Ricky Martin \"Livin' la Vida Loca\" (1999)\n|description=\n|format=[[Ogg]]\n}}\nThe song was the first U.S. number one single to be recorded without using then-conventional recording studio equipment; instead the track was created at Desmond Child's Gentlemen's Club Studio,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mixonline.com/mag/audio_gentlemens_club_desmond/ |title=The Gentlemen's club: DESMOND CHILD'S VIRTUAL AESTHETIC |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102121549/http://mixonline.com/mag/audio_gentlemens_club_desmond/ |archivedate=November 2, 2013 }}</ref> which utilizes a 169-track [[Pro Tools]] system.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mixonline.com/news/profiles/recordin-la-vida-loca-making-hard-disk-hit/374667/|title=RECORDIN' \"LA VIDA LOCA\": THE MAKING OF A HARD DISK HIT - Mixonline|website=www.mixonline.com}}</ref> The recording is also noted for its exceptional use of [[dynamic range compression]] to increase the track's perceived [[loudness]].<ref>{{cite book|quotation=Chapter 8|title=Perfecting Sound Forever: the Story of Recorded Music|author=Greg Milner|publisher=Granta Books|date=2009|isbn=978-1-86207-942-7}}</ref>\n\n==Music video==\nThe video for \"Livin' la Vida Loca\", directed by [[Wayne Isham]] and starring [[Croatia]]n model [[Nina Mori\u0107]], was shot in Los Angeles. It aired later the same month and received six nominations at the [[1999 MTV Video Music Awards]] including [[MTV Video Music Award for Video of the Year|Video of the Year]], [[MTV Video Music Award for Best Male Video|Best Male Video]], [[MTV Video Music Award for Best Choreography|Best Choreography in a Video]] and [[MTV Video Music Award \u2013 Viewer's Choice|Viewer's Choice]]. It won two primary awards for [[MTV Video Music Award for Best Pop Video|Best Pop Video]], and [[MTV Video Music Award for Best Dance Video|Best Dance Video]], and was voted three additional awards in the international Viewers Choice categories. It also won Ritmo Latino Music Award for Music Video of the Year.\n\nThe video features Ricky Martin performing in a pub with his band and hanging out with a lady (Nina Mori\u0107) at different locations, including New York city. One scene shows several dancers taking their shirts off and performing choreographed dance moves while it rains; this scene coincides with the line in the pre-chorus \"She'll make you take your clothes off and go dancing in the rain\". Various snippets of the video seem to merge into each other over the duration of the song. Towards the end of the video, Martin gets distracted by his lady passenger while driving, causing him to drive erratically and causing another car to veer and hit a [[fire hydrant]], releasing a fountain of water; this was also the first scene of the video.\n\n==Chart performance==\n\"Livin' la Vida Loca\" is Martin's biggest hit. It was his first number-one song on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], remaining at the top in the United States for five consecutive weeks and ranking at number ten on the year-end chart of 1999. The single was certified Platinum for sales over one million physical copies in the US alone. It topped the [[Hot Latin Songs]] for nine weeks, and [[Latin Pop Songs]] for ten weeks. Although released long before the [[digital distribution|digital era]], it has sold 502,000 [[Music download|digital]] copies in the US, becoming Martin's best-selling downloaded track.<ref name=digital>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/473334/ask-billboard-what-the-forget-is-going-on?page=0%2C1 |title=Ask Billboard - Viva la 'Vida' singer|date=January 28, 2011|accessdate=January 28, 2011|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc}}</ref> On the [[RPM (magazine)|Canadian RPM Top Singles]] the song stayed at the top for eight weeks, and on the [[Canadian Singles Chart]] for three weeks.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, \"Livin' la Vida Loca\" debuted at number one and stayed there for three weeks. It has sold 832,000 copies and was certified Platinum. The song also reached number one in Greece, Hungary, Ireland, New Zealand and Romania. \"Livin' la Vida Loca\" peaked inside top ten around the world and was certified Platinum, Gold and Silver in

Cheese's]] soundtrack.\n* The song was parodied as \"Livin' la Vida Yoda\" by the Bitter Tasting Omelette, which is a group made up of brothers Todd and Gavin Downing.\n* [[Jimmy Fallon]] parody the song as \"Livin' la Vida Yoda\", a reference to ''[[Star Wars]]'' character [[Yoda]], on an episode of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' which was coincidentally the same one that Martin performed the song as the musical guest.\n* [[Shlock Rock]], a group that parodies popular music with a Jewish theme, wrote \"Learning to Dance the Hora\".\n* Knockout Theory, a New Jersey punk rock band, often performs a version of the song at their live shows.\n* ''Nashville Star'' contestant Gabe Garcia sang a country version of the song in 2008.\n* English metalcore band [[Bury Tomorrow]] released their cover onto Myspace on September 9, 2010.\n* Christian singer [[Mark Lowry]] parodied this song as \"Livin' For Deep-fried [Okra]\".

It was released on March 23, 1999, from Martin's [[Ricky Martin (1999 album)|self-titled]] debut English-language album (he had previously released several albums in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]). The song was composed by [[Desmond Child]] and [[Draco Rosa]]. ''La vida loca'' is Spanish for \"the crazy life.\"\n\n\"Livin' la Vida Loca\" is generally seen as the song that began the [[Latin pop]] explosion that followed and made the transition of other Spanish-speaking artists (first [[Enrique Iglesias]] and [[Marc Anthony]] and later [[Shakira]], [[Paulina Rubio]] and [[Thal\u00eda]]) into the English-speaking market easier. Before this time, most non-Latino Americans had never heard of Martin until what [[CNN]] reported was a show-stopping performance of \"[[La Copa de la Vida]]\" at the [[41st Grammy Awards]] show, which became a catalyst in bringing Latin pop to the forefront of the U.S. music scene.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/SHOWBIZ/Music/9905/17/latin.music/|title=CNN - Ricky Martin leading the Latin (music) revolution - May 17, 1999|website=www.cnn.com}}</ref> \"Livin' la Vida Loca\" sold over 8 million copies, making it one of the [[List of best-selling singles|best selling singles]] of all time.\n\nThe song received various [[Grammy Award]]s nominations and Ricky Martin obtained enormous success inside the United States and worldwide. In 2007, the song was ranked at number 28 on the list of 100 Greatest Songs of the 90's by [[VH1]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rockonthenet.com/archive/2007/vh190s.htm|title=Rock On The Net: VH1: 100 Greatest Songs of the '90s: 1-50|website=www.rockonthenet.com}}</ref> It is Martin's [[signature song]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nMartin performed the song on [[The Voice (Australia series 2)|second series]] of ''[[The Voice (Australian TV series)|The Voice Australia]]'' with fellow judges [[Delta Goodrem]], [[Joel Madden]] and [[Seal (musician)|Seal]].\n\n==Recording==\n{{Listen\n|filename=Ricky Martin Livin La Vida Loca.ogg\n|title=Ricky Martin \"Livin' la Vida Loca\" (1999)\n|description=\n|format=[[Ogg]]\n}}\nThe song was the first U.S. number one single to be recorded without using then-conventional recording studio equipment; instead the track was created at Desmond Child's Gentlemen's Club Studio,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mixonline.com/mag/audio_gentlemens_club_desmond/ |title=The Gentlemen's club: DESMOND CHILD'S VIRTUAL AESTHETIC |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102121549/http://mixonline.com/mag/audio_gentlemens_club_desmond/ |archivedate=November 2, 2013 }}</ref> which utilizes a 169-track [[Pro Tools]] system.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mixonline.com/news/profiles/recordin-la-vida-loca-making-hard-disk-hit/374667/|title=RECORDIN' \"LA VIDA LOCA\": THE MAKING OF A HARD DISK HIT - Mixonline|website=www.mixonline.com}}</ref> The recording is also noted for its exceptional use of [[dynamic range compression]] to increase the track's perceived [[loudness]].<ref>{{cite book|quotation=Chapter 8|title=Perfecting Sound Forever: the Story of Recorded Music|author=Greg Milner|publisher=Granta Books|date=2009|isbn=978-1-86207-942-7}}</ref>\n\n==Music video==\nThe video for \"Livin' la Vida Loca\", directed by [[Wayne Isham]] and starring [[Croatia]]n model [[Nina Mori\u0107]], was shot in Los Angeles. It aired later the same month and received six nominations at the [[1999 MTV Video Music Awards]] including [[MTV Video Music Award for Video of the Year|Video of the Year]], [[MTV Video Music Award for Best Male Video|Best Male Video]], [[MTV Video Music Award for Best Choreography|Best Choreography in a Video]] and [[MTV Video Music Award \u2013 Viewer's Choice|Viewer's Choice]]. It won two primary awards for [[MTV Video Music Award for Best Pop Video|Best Pop Video]], and [[MTV Video Music Award for Best Dance Video|Best Dance Video]], and was voted three additional awards in the international Viewers Choice categories. It also won Ritmo Latino Music Award for Music Video of the Year.\n\nThe video features Ricky Martin performing in a pub with his band and hanging out with a lady (Nina Mori\u0107) at different locations, including New York city. One scene shows several dancers taking their shirts off and performing choreographed dance moves while it rains; this scene coincides with the line in the pre-chorus \"She'll make you take your clothes off and go dancing in the rain\". Various snippets of the video seem to merge into each other over the duration of the song. Towards the end of the video, Martin gets distracted by his lady passenger while driving, causing him to drive erratically and causing another car to veer and hit a [[fire hydrant]], releasing a fountain of water; this was also the first scene of the video.\n\n==Chart performance==\n\"Livin' la Vida Loca\" is Martin's biggest hit. It was his first number-one song on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], remaining at the top in the United States for five consecutive weeks and ranking at number ten on the year-end chart of 1999. The single was certified Platinum for sales over one million physical copies in the US alone. It topped the [[Hot Latin Songs]] for nine weeks, and [[Latin Pop Songs]] for ten weeks. Although released long before the [[digital distribution|digital era]], it has sold 502,000 [[Music download|digital]] copies in the US, becoming Martin's best-selling downloaded track.<ref name=digital>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/473334/ask-billboard-what-the-forget-is-going-on?page=0%2C1 |title=Ask Billboard - Viva la 'Vida' singer|date=January 28, 2011|accessdate=January 28, 2011|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc}}</ref> On the [[RPM (magazine)|Canadian RPM Top Singles]] the song stayed at the top for eight weeks, and on the [[Canadian Singles Chart]] for three weeks.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, \"Livin' la Vida Loca\" debuted at number one and stayed there for three weeks.
