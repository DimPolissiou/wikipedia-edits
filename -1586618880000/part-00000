Various grains (which may be [[Malting|malted]]) are used for different varieties, including [[barley]], [[Maize|corn]], [[rye]], and [[wheat]]. Whisky is typically [[Aging (food)|aged]] in wooden [[cask]]s, generally made of charred [[white oak]].\n\nWhisky is a strictly regulated spirit worldwide with many classes and types. The typical unifying characteristics of the different classes and types are the fermentation of grains, distillation, and aging in wooden barrels.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word ''whisky'' (or ''whiskey'') is an [[anglicisation]] of the [[Classical Gaelic]] word {{lang|ghc|uisce}} (or {{lang|ghc|uisge}}) meaning \"water\" (now written as {{lang|ga|uisce}} in Modern Irish, and {{lang|gd|uisge}} in Scottish Gaelic). Distilled alcohol was known in [[Latin]] as {{lang|la|[[aqua vitae]]}} (\"water of life\"). This was translated into [[Old Irish]] as {{lang|sga|uisce beatha}}, which became {{lang|ga|uisce beatha}} in [[Irish language|Irish]] and {{lang|gd|uisge beatha}} {{IPA-gd|\u02c8\u026f\u0283k\u02b2\u0259 \u02c8b\u025bh\u0259||}} in [[Scottish Gaelic]].

Modern stills are made of stainless steel with copper innards (piping, for example, will be lined with copper along with copper plate inlays along still walls). The simplest standard [[distillation]] apparatus is commonly known as a [[pot still]], consisting of a single heated chamber and a vessel to collect purified alcohol.\n\n[[Column still]]s are frequently used in the production of [[grain whisky]] and are the most commonly used type of still in the production of [[Bourbon whiskey|bourbon]] and other American whiskeys. Column stills behave like a series of single pot stills, formed in a long vertical tube. Whereas a single pot still charged with wine might yield a vapour enriched to 40\u201360% alcohol, a column still can achieve a vapour alcohol content of 95.6%; an [[azeotrope|azeotropic]] mixture of alcohol and water.\n\n===Aging===\nWhiskies do not mature in the bottle, only in the [[barrel|cask]], so the \"age\" of a whisky is only the time between distillation and bottling. This reflects how much the cask has interacted with the whisky, changing its chemical makeup and taste.

They differ in base product, alcoholic content, and quality.\n\n* [[Malt whisky]] is made primarily from [[malt|malted barley]].\n* [[Grain whisky]] is made from any type of grain.\n\nMalts and grains are combined in various ways:\n\n* ''[[Single malt whisky]]'' is whisky from a single distillery made from a mash that uses only one particular malted grain. Unless the whisky is described as ''single-cask'', it contains whisky from many casks, and different years, so the blender can achieve a taste recognisable as typical of the distillery. In most cases, single malts bear the name of the distillery, with an age statement and perhaps some indication of some special treatments, such as maturation in a [[port wine]] cask.\n* ''[[Blended malt whisky]]'' is a mixture of single malt whiskies from different distilleries. If a whisky is labelled \"pure malt\" or just \"malt\" it is almost certainly a blended malt whisky. This was formerly called a \"vatted malt\" whisky.\n* ''[[Blended whisky]]'' is made from a mixture of different types of whisky. A blend may contain whisky from many distilleries so that the blender can produce a flavour consistent with the brand. The brand name may, therefore, omit the name of a distillery. Most Scotch, Irish and Canadian whisky is sold as part of a blend, even when the spirits are the product of one distillery, as is common in Canada.<ref>{{cite book|title=Canadian Whisky: The Portable Expert| last=De Kergommeaux|first=Davin|year=2012|publisher=McClelland & Stewart|isbn=978-0-7710-2743-7|page=58 }}</ref> American blended whisky may contain [[neutral spirits]].\n* ''[[Cask strength]]'' (also known as ''barrel proof'') whiskies are rare, and usually only the very best whiskies are bottled in this way. They are bottled from the cask undiluted or only lightly diluted.\n* ''[[Single cask]]'' (also known as ''single barrel'') whiskies are bottled from an individual cask, and often the bottles are labelled with specific barrel and bottle numbers.

Only water may be added to the final product; the addition of colouring or flavouring is prohibited. These whiskeys must be aged in new charred-oak containers, except for corn whiskey, which does not have to be aged. If it is aged, it must be in uncharred oak barrels or in used barrels. Corn whiskey is usually unaged and sold as a legal version of [[moonshine]].\n\nIf one of these whiskey types reaches two years aging or beyond, it is additionally designated as ''[[straight whiskey|straight]]'', e.g., ''straight rye whiskey''. A whiskey that fulfils all above requirements but derives from less than 51% of any one specific grain can be called simply a ''straight whiskey'' without naming a grain.\n\nUS regulations recognize other whiskey categories,<ref name=cfr5.22/> including:\n\n* [[Blended whiskey]]: a mixture that contains a blend of straight whiskeys and [[neutral grain spirits]] (NGS), and may also contain flavourings and colourings. The percentage of NGS must be disclosed on the label and may be as much at 80% on a proof gallon basis.\n* [[Grain whisky|Light whiskey]]: produced in the US at more than 80% [[alcohol by volume]] and stored in used or uncharred new oak containers\n* [[Spirit whiskey]]: a mixture of neutral spirits and at least 5% of certain stricter categories of whiskey\n\nAnother important labelling in the marketplace is [[Tennessee whiskey]], of which [[Jack Daniel's]], [[George Dickel]], [[Collier and McKeel]],<ref>[http://collierandmckeel.com/ Collier and McKeel] company web site.</ref> and [[Prichard's Tennessee Whiskey|Benjamin Prichard's]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prichardsdistillery.com/whiskey/tennessee-whiskey.cfm|title=Benjamin Prichard's Tennessee Whiskey|accessdate=9 July 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715112723/http://www.prichardsdistillery.com/whiskey/tennessee-whiskey.cfm|archive-date=15 July 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> are the only brands currently bottled.

Fusel oils are higher alcohols than [[ethanol]], are mildly [[toxic]], and have a strong, disagreeable smell and taste. An excess of fusel oils in whisky is considered a defect. A variety of methods are employed in the distillation process to remove unwanted fusel oils.  Traditionally, American distillers focused on secondary filtration using [[charcoal]], [[gravel]], [[sand]], or [[linen]] to remove undesired distillates.\n\n[[Acetal]]s are rapidly formed in distillates and a great many are found in distilled beverages, the most prominent being [[acetaldehyde]] diethyl acetal ([[1,1-diethoxyethane]]). Among whiskies the highest levels are associated with malt whisky.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_OvXjhLUz-oC|title=Volatile Compounds in Foods and Beverages|isbn=978-0-8247-8390-7|last=Maarse|first=H. |year=1991|publisher=CRC Press|page=553}}</ref> This acetal is a principal flavour compound in [[sherry]], and contributes fruitiness to the aroma.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.beerbrewer.co.uk/2007/06/|title=June 2007|publisher=The Beer Brewer|accessdate=8 December 2007|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071219120702/https://www.beerbrewer.co.uk/2007/06/|archivedate=19 December 2007}}</ref>\n\nThe diketone [[diacetyl]] (2,3-butanedione) has a buttery aroma and is present in almost all distilled beverages.

The addition of flavourings is not allowed in [[American whiskey|American]] \"straight\" whiskey, but is allowed in American blends.\n\n===Chill filtration===\nWhisky is often \"[[chill filtering|chill filtered]]\": chilled to precipitate out fatty acid esters and then filtered to remove them.

Unchillfiltered whiskies often turn cloudy when stored at cool temperatures or when cool water is added to them, and this is perfectly normal.<ref>{{cite web|title=Chill Filtration|url=http://www.whiskyforeveryone.com/whisky_basics/chill_filtration.html|work=Whiskey Basics|publisher=Whisky for Everyone|accessdate=21 March 2013}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Liquor}}\n* [[List of cocktails#Whisky]]\n* [[List of whisky brands]]\n* [[Poit\u00edn]]\n* [[Moonshine]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book|last1=Andrews|first1=Allen|title=The Whisky Barons|date=2002|publisher=Angels' Share (Neil Wilson Publishing)|location=Glasgow|isbn=978-1-897784-84-6}}\n* {{cite book |last1= Buxton |first1=Ian |last2= Hughes |first2= Paul S. |title= The Science and Commerce of Whisky |place=Cambridge |year=2014 |publisher= Royal Society of Chemistry |isbn= 978-1-84973-150-8}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Smith |first1= Gavin D. |title= The A\u2013Z of Whisky |date=2009 |publisher= Angels' Share (Neil Wilson Publishing) |location= Glasgow |isbn= 978-1-906476-03-8 |edition=3rd}}\n{{refend}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category}}\n{{Wiktionary}}\n\n{{Whisky |state=expanded}}\n{{Alcoholic beverages}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Whisky| ]]\n", "text_old": "{{about|the alcoholic beverage}}\n{{short description|Type of distilled alcoholic beverage made from fermented grain mash}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2020}}\n{{Infobox beverage\n| name         = Whisky\n| image        = Whiskyhogmanay2010.jpg\n| caption      = A glass of whisky\n| abv          = at least 40%\n| ingredients  = \n| variants     = \n}}\n\n'''Whisky''' or '''whiskey''' is a type of [[Distilled beverage|distilled alcoholic beverage]] made from [[Fermentation in food processing|fermented]] [[grain]] [[mashing|mash]]. Various grains (which may be [[Malting|malted]]) are used for different varieties, including [[barley]], [[Maize|corn]], [[rye]], and [[wheat]]. Whisky is typically [[Aging (food)|aged]] in wooden [[cask]]s, generally made of charred [[white oak]].\n\nWhisky is a strictly regulated spirit worldwide with many classes and types. The typical unifying characteristics of the different classes and types are the fermentation of grains, distillation, and aging in wooden barrels.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word ''whisky'' (or ''whiskey'') is an [[anglicisation]] of the [[Classical Gaelic]] word {{lang|ghc|uisce}} (or {{lang|ghc|uisge}}) meaning \"water\" (now written as {{lang|ga|uisce}} in Modern Irish, and {{lang|gd|uisge}} in Scottish Gaelic). Distilled alcohol was known in [[Latin]] as {{lang|la|[[aqua vitae]]}} (\"water of ,the life\"). This was translated into [[Old Irish]] as {{lang|sga|uisce beatha}} (\"water of life\"), which became {{lang|ga|uisce beatha}} in [[Irish language|Irish]] and {{lang|gd|uisge beatha}} {{IPA-gd|\u02c8\u026f\u0283k\u02b2\u0259 \u02c8b\u025bh\u0259||}} in [[Scottish Gaelic]].

One is that the spelling difference is simply a matter of regional language convention for the spelling of a word, indicating that the spelling varies depending on the intended audience or the background or personal preferences of the writer (like the difference between ''color'' and ''colour''; or ''recognize'' and ''recognise''),<ref name=CowderySpelling2>{{cite web|author=Cowdery, Charles K. |url=http://chuckcowdery.blogspot.com/2009/02/why-spelling-matters.html|title= Why Spelling Matters|website=The Chuck Cowdery Blog|date=24 February 2009}}</ref><ref name=CowderySpelling1>{{cite web|author=Cowdery, Charles K. |url=http://chuckcowdery.blogspot.com/2009/02/new-york-times-buckles-to-pressure-from.html |title=New York Times Buckles To Pressure From Scotch Snobs|website=The Chuck Cowdery Blog|date= 11 February 2009}}</ref> and the other is that the spelling should depend on the style or origin of the spirit being described. There is general agreement that when quoting the proper name printed on a label, the spelling on the label should not be altered.<ref name=CowderySpelling2/><ref name=CowderySpelling1/>\n\nThe spelling ''whiskey'' is common in Ireland and the United States, while ''whisky'' is used in all other whisky-producing countries.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Zandona|first1=Eric|title=A World Guide to Whisk(e)y Distilleries|publisher=White Mule Press|location=Hayward|isbn=978-0983638940|display-authors=etal|date=March 2013}}</ref> In the US, the usage has not always been consistent.

Modern stills are made of stainless steel with copper innards (piping, for example, will be lined with copper along with copper plate inlays along still walls). The simplest standard [[distillation]] apparatus is commonly known as a [[pot still]], consisting of a single heated chamber and a vessel to collect purified alcohol.\n\n[[Column still]]s are frequently used in the production of [[grain whisky]] and are the most commonly used type of still in the production of [[Bourbon whiskey|bourbon]] and other American whiskeys. Column stills behave like a series of single pot stills, formed in a long vertical tube. Whereas a single pot still charged with wine might yield a vapour enriched to 40\u201360% alcohol, a column still can achieve a vapour alcohol content of 95.6%; an [[azeotrope|azeotropic]] mixture of alcohol and water.\n\n===Aging===\nWhiskies do not mature in the bottle, only in the [[barrel|cask]], so the \"age\" of a whisky is only the time between distillation and bottling. This reflects how much the cask has interacted with the whisky, changing its chemical makeup and taste. Whiskies that have been bottled for many years may have a rarity value, but are not \"older\" and not necessarily \"better\" than a more recent whisky that matured in wood for a similar time. After a decade or two, additional aging in a barrel does not necessarily improve a whisky.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.whiskeystill.net/blogs/whiskey-still-co-blog/6356446-whiskey-101|title=Whiskey 101|access-date=14 July 2017|last1=Stone|first1=Jason|date=18 July 2012|publisher=The Whiskey Still Company}}</ref>\n\nWhile aging in wooden casks, especially [[American oak]] and [[Quercus robur|French oak]] casks, whisky undergoes six processes that contribute to its final flavor: [[extraction (chemistry)|extraction]], [[evaporation]], [[oxidation]], [[concentration]], [[filtration]], and [[colour]]ation.<ref>Nickles, Jane, 2015 Certified Specialist of Spirits Study Guide, Society of Wine Educators, p. 23 (2015).</ref> Extraction in particular results in whisky acquiring a number of compounds, including aldehydes and acids such as [[vanillin]], [[vanillic acid]], and [[syringaldehyde]].<ref>Jeffery, John D.E., Aging of Whiskey Spirits in Barrels of Non-Traditional Volume, Master's Thesis, Michigan State University, p. 30 (2012).</ref> Distillers will sometimes age their whiskey in barrels previously used to age other spirits, such as rum or sherry, to impart particular flavours.\n\n===Packaging===\nMost whiskies are sold at or near an alcoholic strength of 40% [[Alcohol by volume|abv]], which is the statutory minimum in some countries<ref name=cfr5.22/> \u2013 although the strength can vary, and cask-strength whisky may have as much as twice that alcohol percentage.\n\n===Exports===\nWhisky is probably the best known of Scotland's manufactured products.

In most cases, single malts bear the name of the distillery, with an age statement and perhaps some indication of some special treatments, such as maturation in a [[port wine]] cask.\n* ''[[Blended malt whisky]]'' is a mixture of single malt whiskies from different distilleries. If a whisky is labelled \"pure malt\" or just \"malt\" it is almost certainly a blended malt whisky. This was formerly called a \"vatted malt\" whisky.\n* ''[[Blended whisky]]'' is made from a mixture of different types of whisky. A blend may contain whisky from many distilleries so that the blender can produce a flavour consistent with the brand. The brand name may, therefore, omit the name of a distillery. Most Scotch, Irish and Canadian whisky is sold as part of a blend, even when the spirits are the product of one distillery, as is common in Canada.<ref>{{cite book|title=Canadian Whisky: The Portable Expert| last=De Kergommeaux|first=Davin|year=2012|publisher=McClelland & Stewart|isbn=978-0-7710-2743-7|page=58 }}</ref> American blended whisky may contain [[neutral spirits]].\n* ''[[Cask strength]]'' (also known as ''barrel proof'') whiskies are rare, and usually only the very best whiskies are bottled in this way. They are bottled from the cask undiluted or only lightly diluted.\n* ''[[Single cask]]'' (also known as ''single barrel'') whiskies are bottled from an individual cask, and often the bottles are labelled with specific barrel and bottle numbers.

Only water may be added to the final product; the addition of colouring or flavouring is prohibited. These whiskeys must be aged in new charred-oak containers, except for corn whiskey, which does not have to be aged. If it is aged, it must be in uncharred oak barrels or in used barrels. Corn whiskey is usually unaged and sold as a legal version of [[moonshine]].\n\nIf one of these whiskey types reaches two years aging or beyond, it is additionally designated as ''[[straight whiskey|straight]]'', e.g., ''straight rye whiskey''. A whiskey that fulfils all above requirements but derives from less than 51% of any one specific grain can be called simply a ''straight whiskey'' without naming a grain.\n\nUS regulations recognize other whiskey categories,<ref name=cfr5.22/> including:\n\n* [[Blended whiskey]]: a mixture that contains a blend of straight whiskeys and [[neutral grain spirits]] (NGS), and may also contain flavourings and colourings. The percentage of NGS must be disclosed on the label and may be as much at 80% on a proof gallon basis.\n* [[Grain whisky|Light whiskey]]: produced in the US at more than 80% [[alcohol by volume]] and stored in used or uncharred new oak containers\n* [[Spirit whiskey]]: a mixture of neutral spirits and at least 5% of certain stricter categories of whiskey\n\nAnother important labelling in the marketplace is [[Tennessee whiskey]], of which [[Jack Daniel's]], [[George Dickel]], [[Collier and McKeel]],<ref>[http://collierandmckeel.com/ Collier and McKeel] company web site.</ref> and [[Prichard's Tennessee Whiskey|Benjamin Prichard's]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prichardsdistillery.com/whiskey/tennessee-whiskey.cfm|title=Benjamin Prichard's Tennessee Whiskey|accessdate=9 July 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715112723/http://www.prichardsdistillery.com/whiskey/tennessee-whiskey.cfm|archive-date=15 July 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> are the only brands currently bottled.

Whiskies and cognacs typically contain more of this than [[vodka]]s, but significantly less than rums or [[brandy|brandies]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_OvXjhLUz-oC|title=Volatile Compounds in Foods and Beverages|isbn=978-0-8247-8390-7|last=Maarse|first=H. |year=1991|publisher=CRC Press|page=554}}</ref>\n\nPolysulfides and thiophenes enter whiskey through the distillation process and contribute to its roasted flavor.<ref name=\"Cole 361\u2013385\"/>\n\n===Flavours from oak===\n[[File:Oak Barrel.png|thumb|A charred oak barrel used to age whiskey]]\nWhisky that has been aged in [[Barrel#Whiskey|oak barrels]] absorbs substances from the wood.

[[Canadian whisky]] may contain caramel and flavouring in addition to the distilled mash spirits. Scotch whisky may contain added [[caramel color|(E150A) caramel colouring]], but no other additives. The addition of flavourings is not allowed in [[American whiskey|American]] \"straight\" whiskey, but is allowed in American blends.\n\n===Chill filtration===\nWhisky is often \"[[chill filtering|chill filtered]]\": chilled to precipitate out fatty acid esters and then filtered to remove them. Most whiskies are bottled this way, unless specified as ''unchillfiltered'' or ''non-chill filtered''. This is done primarily for cosmetic reasons. Unchillfiltered whiskies often turn cloudy when stored at cool temperatures or when cool water is added to them, and this is perfectly normal.<ref>{{cite web|title=Chill Filtration|url=http://www.whiskyforeveryone.com/whisky_basics/chill_filtration.html|work=Whiskey Basics|publisher=Whisky for Everyone|accessdate=21 March 2013}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Liquor}}\n* [[List of cocktails#Whisky]]\n* [[List of whisky brands]]\n* [[Poit\u00edn]]\n* [[Moonshine]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book|last1=Andrews|first1=Allen|title=The Whisky Barons|date=2002|publisher=Angels' Share (Neil Wilson Publishing)|location=Glasgow|isbn=978-1-897784-84-6}}\n* {{cite book |last1= Buxton |first1=Ian |last2= Hughes |first2= Paul S. |title= The Science and Commerce of Whisky |place=Cambridge |year=2014 |publisher= Royal Society of Chemistry |isbn= 978-1-84973-150-8}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Smith |first1= Gavin D. |title= The A\u2013Z of Whisky |date=2009 |publisher= Angels' Share (Neil Wilson Publishing) |location= Glasgow |isbn= 978-1-906476-03-8 |edition=3rd}}\n{{refend}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category}}\n{{Wiktionary}}\n\n{{Whisky |state=expanded}}\n{{Alcoholic beverages}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Whisky| ]]\n", "name_user": "Futhark", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eEtymology:\"aqua vitae\" means \"water of life\"", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whisky"}

The tectonic processes on the high Atlas proabaly lead to most of the Volcanic manifestations locally.<ref name=\"Montenat\"/> \n\n===Stratigraphy===\nThe formation is subdivided on several stratigraphic levels, starting with the so called  facies of term A, composed by  [[Gypsum]] and [[Salt]], from Triassic age, supported by the presence of Volcanic Intercalations of basalt.<ref name=\"Montenat\"/><ref name=Allain0 /><ref name=Allain1 /><ref name=Allain2 /><ref name=Allain3 /> Above that, there are carbonates of term B alternated at the first with [[Dolomite (rock)|Dolomite]]s, [[Pelite]]s and [[Limestone]]s along with Marly-[[Silt]] crimes with plant debris, which had regular influence  of a marine environment.<ref name=\"Montenat\"/><ref name=Allain2 /><ref name=Allain3 /> That is proved by the presence of [[Ooid]]s, [[Oncolith]]s, debris of [[Mollusc]]s and benthic [[Foraminifer]]s, being dissolved and recrystallized as [[Sparite]].<ref name=\"Montenat\"/><ref name=Allain2 /><ref name=Allain3 /> The third level shows a transition between marine and continental deposits, through carbonate palustrine levels and [[Caliche]] horizons, being continental layers superimposed in stratigraphic continuity over the marine carbonates of the lower Lias ([[Sinemurian]]-[[Hettangian]]).<ref name=\"Montenat\"/><ref name=Allain2 /><ref name=Allain3 /> Those continental layers are rich in [[Coarse structure|Coarse]] Volcano-detrital episodes as result of a sedimentary  process of  high sedimentation rates, where the strata,  including the deposit with Dinosaur fossils, where deposited on a short time interval, where Middle Jurassic [[Bajocian]]-[[Bathonian]] carbonate levels, frequent within the Atlas domain, do not exist not in Toundoute.<ref name=\"Montenat\"/><ref name=Allain2 /><ref name=Allain3 /> The sedimentation on the Toundoute member have some characteristics, such as  lenticular channels with [[Sieve]]-[[Conglomerate (geology)|Conglomerate]] of ~5 m thick (\u2264 5m) for visible decametric, composed of several materials, like  Volcanic products, as  blocks of volcanic rocks such as sands made of [[Feldspar]]s, black ferruginous grains from the surface of volcanic rocks on dry periods, siliceous green fragments from post eruption processes  ([[Vein (geology)|Vein]]s, [[Microgeode]]s, [[Nippled Concretions]]), [[Limestone]] debris with traces of roots and cracks, where in some parts traces dark fine bushy algae filaments are still visible, similar to te genus [[Girvanella]] blue-green algae.<ref name=\"Montenat\"/><ref name=Allain2 /><ref name=Allain3 /> Other materials include [[Schist]] and Vein [[Quartz]], witouth bone and wood debris with a good cellular structure.<ref name=\"Montenat\"/><ref name=Allain2 /><ref name=Allain3 /> The [[Floodplain]]-like deposits are divided in two parts, with hard [[Limestone]] nodules, pink or brick and very irregular, typical of profiles of [[Calcimorph Soils]] formed on climates with pronounced dry phases.

BNFL designed, licensed, and currently own and operate a fleet of approximately 170 casks of the Excellox design.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} BNFL has maintained a fleet of transport casks to ship\nSNF for the [[United Kingdom]], continental [[Europe]], and [[Japan]] for [[Nuclear reprocessing|reprocessing]].\n\nIn the UK a series of public demonstrations were conducted{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} in which spent fuel flasks (loaded with steel bars) were subjected to simulated accident conditions. A randomly selected flask (''never used for holding used fuel'') from the production line was first dropped from a tower. The flask was dropped in such a way that the weakest part of it would hit the ground first. The lid of the flask was slightly damaged but very little material escaped from the flask. A little water escaped from the flask but it was thought that in a real accident that the escape of radioactivity associated with this water would not be a threat to humans or their environment.\n\nFor a second test the same flask was fitted with a new lid, filled again with steel bars and water before a train was driven into it at high speed. The flask survived with only cosmetic damage while the train was destroyed. Although referred to as a test, the actual stresses the flask underwent were well below what they are designed to withstand, as much of the energy from the collision was absorbed by the train and also in moving the flask some distance.\nThis flask is on display at the training center at [[Heysham nuclear power station|Heysham 1 Power Station]].\n\n====Description====\nIntroduced in the early 1960s, [[Magnox]] flasks consists of four layers; an internal [[skip (container)|skip]] containing the waste; guides and protectors surrounding the skip; all contained within the {{convert|370|mm|in|adj=mid|-thick}} steel main body of flask itself, with characteristic cooling fins; and (since the early 1990s) a transport cabin of panels which provide an external housing.  Flasks for waste from the later [[advanced gas cooled reactor]] power stations are similar, but have thinner steel main walls at {{convert|90|mm|in|adj=mid|-thick}} thickness, to allow room for extensive internal [[lead shielding]]. The flask is protected by a [[Screw|bolt]] [[Latch (hardware)|hasp]] which prevents the content from being accessed during transit.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/files/pdfs/migrated/MultimediaFiles/Live/FullReport/1679.PDF |title=Flask Specifications |publisher=Greenpeace |accessdate=22 February 2014}}</ref>\n\n====Transport====\nAll the flasks are owned by the [[Nuclear Decommissioning Authority]], the owners of [[Direct Rail Services]]. A train conveying flasks would be hauled by two locomotives, either [[British Rail Class 20|Class 20]] or [[British Rail Class 37|Class 37]], but [[British Rail Class 66|Class 66]] and [[British Rail Class 68|Class 68]] locomotives are increasingly being used; locomotives are used in pairs as a precaution in case one fails en route.

A randomly selected flask (''never used for holding used fuel'') from the production line was first dropped from a tower. The flask was dropped in such a way that the weakest part of it would hit the ground first. The lid of the flask was slightly damaged but very little material escaped from the flask. A little water escaped from the flask but it was thought that in a real accident that the escape of radioactivity associated with this water would not be a threat to humans or their environment.\n\nFor a second test the same flask was fitted with a new lid, filled again with steel bars and water before a train was driven into it at high speed. The flask survived with only cosmetic damage while the train was destroyed. Although referred to as a test, the actual stresses the flask underwent were well below what they are designed to withstand, as much of the energy from the collision was absorbed by the train and also in moving the flask some distance.\nThis flask is on display at the training center at [[Heysham nuclear power station|Heysham 1 Power Station]].\n\n====Description====\nIntroduced in the early 1960s, [[Magnox]] flasks consists of four layers; an internal [[skip (container)|skip]] containing the waste; guides and protectors surrounding the skip; all contained within the {{convert|370|mm|in|adj=mid|-thick}} steel main body of flask itself, with characteristic cooling fins; and (since the early 1990s) a transport cabin of panels which provide an external housing.  Flasks for waste from the later [[advanced gas cooled reactor]] power stations are similar, but have thinner steel main walls at {{convert|90|mm|in|adj=mid|-thick}} thickness, to allow room for extensive internal [[lead shielding]].

They were primarily cattle thieves, but the brothers were found guilty of murder and Patrick was hanged in [[Boggo Road Gaol]] in 1903.\n\n==Early life==\n\nPatrick was born at Main Creek, near [[Dungog, New South Wales]], on 28 September 1863. Along with his father and three brothers, Patrick worked as a labourer in northern [[New South Wales]] in the 1880\u2019s. He had an extensive lawless history:\n* 12 November 1878, at [[Casino, New South Wales]], he was fined \u00a35 for a breach of the Impounding Act. \n* 21 January 1884, at Casino, New South Wales, he was fined \u00a32 for riotous conduct. \n* 21 February 1888, at [[Grafton, New South Wales]], he was convicted of cattle stealing, and sentenced to four years\n\nThe Kenniff family moved across the border into the colony of [[Queensland]] in 1891. \n* 14 March 1895, he and brother James were convicted at [[Roma, Queensland]] of horse stealing, and sentenced to three years\n* 22 August 1899, he was convicted at Roma of receiving a stolen cheque, and sentenced to three years \nAfter their release they moved to the [[Upper Warrego]] where their father took up a large grazing lease known as Ralph Block.\n\nThe Kenniffs became the prime suspects when cattle disappeared from neighbouring properties, local squatters demanded their eviction. The Kenniffs took up a nomadic life, riding armed through the district, they continued to steal cattle and horses and held up a general store at [[Yuleba, Queensland|Yuleba]]. The police were so concerned that the Upper Warrego Police Station was established on the Ralph property.\n\n==Murder and capture==\n\nIn March 1902, a warrant was issued against the brothers for stealing a pony. A police posse set out consisting of Constable George Doyle, Albert Dahlke (the manager of [[Carnarvon Station]]), and Sam Johnson (an [[Aboriginal tracker]]). On the morning of Sunday 30 March 1902, the police party surprised the Kenniffs, who were camping at [[Lethbridge's Pocket]], and took James into custody but Patrick managed to escape. Sam Johnson was sent to collect the police pack horses so they could start in pursuit of Patrick Kenniff. However, on his return, he found Doyle and Dahlke were nowhere to be seen, and he was chased by the Kenniffs as he fled for help. A later search located the camp site, showing considerable evidence that a gun fight had occurred. Constable Doyle's horse was located and the saddle bags were found to contain approximately 200 pounds of charcoal that was later identified as burnt human remains, including some personal belongings of Doyle and Dahlke.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article213724708|title=LATEST PARTICULARS.|date=11 April 1902|issue=15|location=Queensland, Australia|volume=XXV|page=4|via=National Library of Australia|newspaper=[[The St. George Standard And Balonne Advertiser]]|accessdate=11 June 2017}}</ref> It became apparent that the Kenniffs had burnt the bodies of Doyle and Dahlke with the intention of disposing of their ashes, in an attempt to conceal evidence of the crime.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.police.qld.gov.au/aboutUs/commemoration/honour/roll02.htm|title=ROLL OF HONOUR 1889 - 1903|publisher=[[Queensland Police]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170601051751/https://www.police.qld.gov.au/aboutUs/commemoration/honour/roll02.htm|archive-date=1 June 2017|url-status=live|access-date=1 June 2017}}</ref>\n\nA reward of \u00a31,000 and a large police manhunt was organised.

Along with his father and three brothers, Patrick worked as a labourer in northern [[New South Wales]] in the 1880\u2019s. He had an extensive lawless history:\n* November 12, 1878, at [[Casino, New South Wales]], he was fined \u00a35 for a breach of the Impounding Act. \n* January 21, 1884, at Casino, New South Wales, he was fined \u00a32 for riotous conduct. \n* February 21, 1888, at [[Grafton, New South Wales]], he was convicted of cattle stealing, and sentenced to four years\n\nThe Kenniff family moved across the border into the colony of [[Queensland]] in 1891. \n* March 14, 1895, he and brother James were convicted at [[Roma, Queensland]] of horse stealing, and sentenced to three years\n* August 22, 1899, he was convicted at Roma of receiving a stolen cheque, and sentenced to three years \nAfter their release they moved to the [[Upper Warrego]] where their father took up a large grazing lease known as Ralph Block.\n\nThe Kenniffs became the prime suspects when cattle disappeared from neighbouring properties, local squatters demanded their eviction. The Kenniffs took up a nomadic life, riding armed through the district, they continued to steal cattle and horses and held up a general store at [[Yuleba, Queensland|Yuleba]]. The police were so concerned that the Upper Warrego Police Station was established on the Ralph property.\n\n==Murder and capture==\n\nIn March 1902, a warrant was issued against the brothers for stealing a pony. A police posse set out consisting of Constable George Doyle, Albert Dahlke (the manager of [[Carnarvon Station]]), and Sam Johnson (an [[Aboriginal tracker]]). On the morning of Sunday 30 March 1902, the police party surprised the Kenniffs, who were camping at [[Lethbridge's Pocket]], and took James into custody but Patrick managed to escape. Sam Johnson was sent to collect the police pack horses so they could start in pursuit of Patrick Kenniff. However, on his return, he found Doyle and Dahlke were nowhere to be seen, and he was chased by the Kenniffs as he fled for help. A later search located the camp site, showing considerable evidence that a gun fight had occurred. Constable Doyle's horse was located and the saddle bags were found to contain approximately 200 pounds of charcoal that was later identified as burnt human remains, including some personal belongings of Doyle and Dahlke.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article213724708|title=LATEST PARTICULARS.|date=11 April 1902|issue=15|location=Queensland, Australia|volume=XXV|page=4|via=National Library of Australia|newspaper=[[The St. George Standard And Balonne Advertiser]]|accessdate=11 June 2017}}</ref> It became apparent that the Kenniffs had burnt the bodies of Doyle and Dahlke with the intention of disposing of their ashes, in an attempt to conceal evidence of the crime.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.police.qld.gov.au/aboutUs/commemoration/honour/roll02.htm|title=ROLL OF HONOUR 1889 - 1903|publisher=[[Queensland Police]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170601051751/https://www.police.qld.gov.au/aboutUs/commemoration/honour/roll02.htm|archive-date=1 June 2017|url-status=live|access-date=1 June 2017}}</ref>\n\nA reward of \u00a31,000 and a large police manhunt was organised.
