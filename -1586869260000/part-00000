He was a trusted enforcer of former [[Crime boss|kingpin]] [[Mario Ram\u00edrez Trevi\u00f1o]], who appointed him the regional boss of [[Camargo Municipality, Tamaulipas|Camargo]]. He helped to coordinate cocaine and marijuana shipments heading to [[Reynosa]] and [[R\u00edo Bravo, Tamaulipas|R\u00edo Bravo]] before they were smuggled into the U.S. for further distribution. In 2014, he was arrested by federal forces in Reynosa and imprisoned in a maximum-security facility in the [[State of Mexico]]. Salazar Flores was convicted of drug trafficking in 2017 and sentenced to 20 years. He was also ordered to pay 500 days of the minimum wage in fines, totaling [[Mexican peso|MXN$]]33,645. \n\n==Early life and career==\nEleno Salazar Flores was born in [[Jim\u00e9nez, Tamaulipas]], Mexico, in {{birth based on age as of date|49|2014|07|25|noage=1}}.<ref name=\"Ij8cv\" /> He was a high-ranking member of the [[Gulf Cartel]], a criminal group based in [[Tamaulipas]].<ref name=\"CoWvY\" /><ref name=\"PVepP\" /> When Salazar Flores started his criminal career, he was known for keeping a low-profile.<ref name=\"yRZRY\" /> He then rose through the leadership ranks and became one of the Gulf Cartel's main administrators under the kingpin [[Mario Ram\u00edrez Trevi\u00f1o]] (\"El Pel\u00f3n\").<ref name=\"cnspantera\" /><ref name=\"mgNyV\" /> After cartel leader [[Samuel Flores Borrego]] (\"Metro 3\") was killed in September 2011, Ram\u00edrez Trevi\u00f1o reportedly took his place and appointed Salazar Flores as the regional boss of [[Camargo Municipality, Tamaulipas|Camargo]]. In this role, he was responsible for coordinating drug trafficking shipments heading to [[Reynosa]] and [[R\u00edo Bravo, Tamaulipas|R\u00edo Bravo]] before they were smuggled into the U.S. for further distribution.<ref name=\"cnspantera\" /><ref name=\"sourcesx20\" /> He was also responsible for supervising human trafficking rings, arms smuggling operations and the flow of drug proceeds back into Mexico. Independent smugglers who wanted to operate in his region were ordered to pay a fee that Salazar Flores's faction collected.{{efn|In the Mexican criminal underworld, this fee or taxation is known as ''piso''.<ref name=\"gXZ8H\" />}}<ref name=\"vqTmF\" /> The corridor in Tamaulipas that Salazar Flores supervised was key to the Gulf Cartel's international drug trafficking operations.<ref name=\"L0Byj\" /> By working closely with Ram\u00edrez Trevi\u00f1o, Salazar Flores was identified as a high-ranking member of the Gulf Cartel and became increasingly important. In August 2013, Ram\u00edrez Trevi\u00f1o was arrested, and Salazar Flores began to work under kingpin [[Juan Manuel Rodr\u00edguez Garc\u00eda]] (\"Juan Perros\"), who became one of the cartel's leaders.<ref name=\"Odped\" /> \n\nIn the cartel, Salazar Flores was known by his alias \"Pantera 6\" (English: Panther 6),<ref name=\"t3SAy\" /> a code name that derived from his association with the cartel faction known as ''Los Pantera'' (English: The Panthers) or ''Grupo Pantera'' (English: Panther Group).<ref name=\"Dyfer\" /><ref name=\"QCx0c\" /> He was reportedly the leader of the faction which served as an assassination squad and was composed mostly of former members from the [[Tamaulipas State Police]].<ref name=\"Odped\" /><ref name=\"Dyfer\" /> Salazar Flores also went by the alias \"Leno\", which is a shortened version of his first name Eleno.<ref name=\"CymzQ\" /> In June 2013, a federal judge in the State of Mexico issued an arrest warrant against him for his organized crime involvement and drug trafficking charges.<ref name=\"Vdgeex\" /> Salazar Flores was also subject to at least three investigations at the federal level for other crimes under that jurisdiction.{{efn|Another source stated that there were at least four federal investigations against Salazar Flores.<ref name=\"CEEB4\" />}}<ref name=\"kO90a\" /> After Rodr\u00edguez Garc\u00eda was arrested in May 2014,<ref name=\"lxqWK\" /> [[Infighting in the Gulf Cartel|infighting broke out]] within the Gulf Cartel, and factions headed by Salazar Flores competed against those aligned to [[Juan Francisco Mart\u00ednez Ram\u00edrez]] (\"Paquito 77\").{{efn|In primary sources, Juan Francisco Mart\u00ednez Ram\u00edrez was referred to by his aliases Jos\u00e9 Francisco Loredo Gaona or Francisco Banda Lucio.<ref name=\"3fIni\" /><ref name=\"reforma77\" /> However, it was later revealed that his alias was \"Paquito 77\",<ref name=\"reforma77\" /> whose real identity is Mart\u00ednez Ram\u00edrez.<ref name=\"Db6Ct\" /> }}<ref name=\"reforma77\" /> In mid-2014, the Mexican government began a new security strategy to combat organized crime groups in Tamaulipas.

No shots were fired during his apprehension.<ref name=\"697aI\" /> At the scene, authorities seized two vehicles, three handguns, three rifles and magazines, and a bag with [[methamphetamine]].<ref name=\"x3xIY\" /> For carrying firearms, both suspects were found [[In flagrante delicto|''in flagrante delicto'']] and were indicted for illegal possession of firearms.<ref name=\"RRdghs\" /> Both Salazar Flores and Trevi\u00f1o Estrada were placed under the jurisdiction of the PGR.<ref name=\"xfqOA\" /> They were flown to [[Mexico City]] on 25&nbsp;July for their formal declaration at the PGR's installations in [[Colonia Guerrero]].<ref name=\"RRdghs\" />  \n\nOn 25&nbsp;July 2014, several shootouts between the Federal Police and suspected Gulf Cartel gunmen broke out in different parts of Reynosa. The shootouts were described as part of the turmoil in the aftermath of Salazar Flores' arrest. According to law enforcement reports, that evening a vehicle driven by suspected cartel members was ordered to stop by policemen. The suspects disobeyed the request and fled the scene which triggered a pursuit; a shootout then broke out between both parties.<ref name=\"reynosabala\" /> Three suspected gangsters were killed, including [[Ra\u00fal Hern\u00e1ndez Barr\u00f3n]] (\"El Flanders 1\"), a high-ranking cartel member.<ref name=\"reynosabala\" /><ref name=\"7m574\" /> The following day, journalists reported that another shootout broke out in Reynosa near the [[Pharr\u2013Reynosa International Bridge]]. This incident also originated after a vehicle stop, but on this occasion one police officer was killed and two others were wounded. Six suspected cartel members were arrested and taken into custody. Though government officials did not provide an official statement on these shootouts, there were reports of more gunfights, roadblocks, and the presence of armed men around Reynosa on social media.<ref name=\"reynosabala\" />  \n\nIn August 2014, Salazar Flores was transferred to the [[Federal Social Readaptation Center No. 1]] (\"Altiplano\"), a maximum-security prison in the State of Mexico, following an order from a State of Mexico federal judge.<ref name=\"Vdgeex\" /> On 25&nbsp;April 2017,<ref name=\"AmLBf\" /> the [[SEIDO|Assistant Attorney General's Office for Special Investigations on Organized Crime]] (SEIDO), Mexico's organized crime investigation agency, confirmed that a judge in [[Toluca|Toluca, State of Mexico]], had sentenced Salazar Flores to 20 years in prison and 500 days of minimum-wage fines, totaling MXN$33,645 (roughly US$1,787 in 2017).<ref name=\"Xe0Rj\" /> The conviction confirmed that Salazar Flores played a leading role as one of the Gulf Cartel's financial operators.<ref name=\"sP3g4\" /> In addition, he was found guilty of participating in cocaine and marijuana trafficking activities from Mexico to the U.S., as well as collecting taxes from independent traffickers who operated in his region.<ref name=\"Vdgeex\" />\n\n==See also==\n*[[Mexican Drug War]]\n\n== Footnotes

high-ranking member of the [[Gulf Cartel]], a criminal group based in [[Tamaulipas]], Mexico. He was a trusted enforcer of former [[Crime boss|kingpin]] [[Mario Ram\u00edrez Trevi\u00f1o]], who appointed him the regional boss of [[Camargo Municipality, Tamaulipas|Camargo]]. He helped to coordinate cocaine and marijuana shipments heading to [[Reynosa]] and [[R\u00edo Bravo, Tamaulipas|R\u00edo Bravo]] before they were smuggled into the U.S. for further distribution. In 2014, he was arrested by federal forces in Reynosa and imprisoned in a maximum-security facility in the [[State of Mexico]]. Salazar Flores was convicted of drug trafficking in 2017 and sentenced to 20 years. He was also ordered to pay 500 days of the minimum wage in fines, totaling [[Mexican peso|MXN$]]33,645. \n\n==Early life and career==\nEleno Salazar Flores was born in [[Jim\u00e9nez, Tamaulipas]], Mexico, in {{birth based on age as of date|49|2014|07|25|noage=1}}.<ref name=\"Ij8cv\" /> He was a high-ranking member of the [[Gulf Cartel]], a criminal group based in [[Tamaulipas]].<ref name=\"CoWvY\" /><ref name=\"PVepP\" /> When Salazar Flores started his criminal career, he was known for keeping a low-profile.<ref name=\"yRZRY\" /> He then rose through the leadership ranks and became one of the Gulf Cartel's main administrators under the kingpin [[Mario Ram\u00edrez Trevi\u00f1o]] (\"El Pel\u00f3n\").<ref name=\"cnspantera\" /><ref name=\"mgNyV\" /> After cartel leader [[Samuel Flores Borrego]] (\"Metro 3\") was killed in September 2011, Ram\u00edrez Trevi\u00f1o reportedly took his place and appointed Salazar Flores as the regional boss of [[Camargo Municipality, Tamaulipas|Camargo]]. In this role, he was responsible for coordinating drug trafficking shipments heading to [[Reynosa]] and [[R\u00edo Bravo, Tamaulipas|R\u00edo Bravo]] before they were smuggled into the U.S. for further distribution.<ref name=\"cnspantera\" /><ref name=\"sourcesx20\" /> He was also responsible for supervising human trafficking rings, arms smuggling operations and the flow of drug proceeds back into Mexico. Independent smugglers who wanted to operate in his region were ordered to pay a fee that Salazar Flores's faction collected.{{efn|In the Mexican criminal underworld, this fee or taxation is known as ''piso''.<ref name=\"gXZ8H\" />}}<ref name=\"vqTmF\" /> The corridor in Tamaulipas that Salazar Flores supervised was key to the Gulf Cartel's international drug trafficking operations.<ref name=\"L0Byj\" /> By working closely with Ram\u00edrez Trevi\u00f1o, Salazar Flores was identified as a high-ranking member of the Gulf Cartel and became increasingly important. In August 2013, Ram\u00edrez Trevi\u00f1o was arrested, and Salazar Flores began to work under kingpin [[Juan Manuel Rodr\u00edguez Garc\u00eda]] (\"Juan Perros\"), who became one of the cartel's leaders.<ref name=\"Odped\" /> \n\nIn the cartel, Salazar Flores was known by his alias \"Pantera 6\" (English: Panther 6),<ref name=\"t3SAy\" /> a code name that derived from his association with the cartel faction known as ''Los Pantera'' (English: The Panthers) or ''Grupo Pantera'' (English: Panther Group).<ref name=\"Dyfer\" /><ref name=\"QCx0c\" /> He was reportedly the the leader of the faction which served as an assassination squad and was composed mostly of former members from the [[Tamaulipas State Police]].<ref name=\"Odped\" /><ref name=\"Dyfer\" /> Salazar Flores also went by the alias \"Leno\", which is a shortened version of his first name Eleno.<ref name=\"CymzQ\" /> In June 2013, a federal judge in the State of Mexico issued an arrest warrant against him for his organized crime involvement and drug trafficking charges.<ref name=\"Vdgeex\" /> Salazar Flores was also subject to at least three investigations at the federal level for other crimes under that jurisdiction.{{efn|Another source stated that there were at least four federal investigations against Salazar Flores.<ref name=\"CEEB4\" />}}<ref name=\"kO90a\" /> After Rodr\u00edguez Garc\u00eda was arrested in May 2014,<ref name=\"lxqWK\" /> [[Infighting in the Gulf Cartel|infighting broke out]] within the Gulf Cartel, and factions headed by Salazar Flores competed against those aligned to [[Juan Francisco Mart\u00ednez Ram\u00edrez]] (\"Paquito 77\").{{efn|In primary sources, Juan Francisco Mart\u00ednez Ram\u00edrez was referred to by his aliases Jos\u00e9 Francisco Loredo Gaona or Francisco Banda Lucio.<ref name=\"3fIni\" /><ref name=\"reforma77\" /> However, it was later revealed that his alias was \"Paquito 77\",<ref name=\"reforma77\" /> whose real identity is Mart\u00ednez Ram\u00edrez.<ref name=\"Db6Ct\" /> }}<ref name=\"reforma77\" /> In mid-2014, the Mexican government began a new security strategy to combat organized crime groups in Tamaulipas. They issued a list of the states's fourteen most-wanted criminals, including Salazar Flores.{{efn|The existence of this list was first published by the media outlet ''24 Horas'' on April 2014.<ref name=\"Uz7sM\" /><ref name=\"itzli\" /> It included 12 most-wanted criminals instead of 14.<ref name=\"itzli\" /> The cited source mentions that the list was released officially in May 2014.<ref name=\"mileniolista\" /> In July 2014, the list was updated to 14 criminals, this time including Salazar Flores.<ref name=\"itzli\" />}}<ref name=\"mileniolista\" />\n\n==Arrest and conviction==\nOn 24&nbsp;July 2014,<ref name=\"u8qYf\" /> Salazar Flores was arrested in Reynosa during a joint operation carried out by the [[Attorney General of Mexico|Attorney General's Office]] (PGR), the [[Federal Police (Mexico)|Federal Police]], the [[Mexican Navy]] and [[Mexican Army|Army]].<ref name=\"V7gNr\" /> He was captured with Guadalupe Gerardo Trevi\u00f1o Estrada (aged 48), a state police officer from Matamoros.<ref name=\"uOpEe\" /> According to the [[National Security Commission (Mexico)|National Security Commission]] (CNS) ([[:es:Comisi\u00f3n Nacional de Seguridad|es]]) chief [[Monte Alejandro Rubido Garc\u00eda]], his arrest was a result of law enforcement intelligence.<ref name=\"eYKbC\" /> Security forces received a tip from an anonymous citizen who told the police of a meeting being held by organized crime members.<ref name=\"WrJEw\" /> This information helped security forces learn of Salazar Flores' whereabouts. No shots were fired during his apprehension.<ref name=\"697aI\" /> At the scene, authorities seized two vehicles, three handguns, three rifles and magazines, and a bag with [[methamphetamine]].<ref name=\"x3xIY\" /> For carrying firearms, both suspects were found [[In flagrante delicto|''in flagrante delicto'']] and were indicted for illegal possession of firearms.<ref name=\"RRdghs\" /> Both Salazar Flores and Trevi\u00f1o Estrada were placed under the jurisdiction of the PGR.<ref name=\"xfqOA\" /> They were flown to [[Mexico City]] on 25&nbsp;July for their formal declaration at the PGR's installations in [[Colonia Guerrero]].<ref name=\"RRdghs\" />  \n\nOn 25&nbsp;July 2014, several shootouts between the Federal Police and suspected Gulf Cartel gunmen broke out in different parts of Reynosa. The shootouts were described as part of the turmoil in the aftermath of Salazar Flores' arrest. According to law enforcement reports, that evening a vehicle driven by suspected cartel members was ordered to stop by policemen. The suspects disobeyed the request and fled the scene which triggered a pursuit; a shootout then broke out between both parties.<ref name=\"reynosabala\" /> Three suspected gangsters were killed, including [[Ra\u00fal Hern\u00e1ndez Barr\u00f3n]] (\"El Flanders 1\"), a high-ranking cartel member.<ref name=\"reynosabala\" /><ref name=\"7m574\" /> The following day, journalists reported that another shootout broke out in Reynosa near the [[Pharr\u2013Reynosa International Bridge]]. This incident also originated after a vehicle stop, but on this occasion one police officer was killed and two others were wounded. Six suspected cartel members were arrested and taken into custody. Though government officials did not provide an official statement on these shootouts, there were reports of more gunfights, roadblocks, and the presence of armed men around Reynosa on social media.<ref name=\"reynosabala\" />  \n\nIn August 2014, Salazar Flores was transferred to the [[Federal Social Readaptation Center No. 1]] (\"Altiplano\"), a maximum-security prison in the State of Mexico, following an order from a State of Mexico federal judge.<ref name=\"Vdgeex\" /> On 25&nbsp;April 2017,<ref name=\"AmLBf\" /> the [[SEIDO|Assistant Attorney General's Office for Special

prison and 500 days of minimum-wage fines, totaling MXN$33,645 (roughly US$1,787 in 2017).<ref name=\"Xe0Rj\" /> The conviction confirmed that Salazar Flores played a leading role as one of the Gulf Cartel's financial operators.<ref name=\"sP3g4\" /> In addition, he was found guilty of participating in cocaine and marijuana trafficking activities from Mexico to the U.S., as well as collecting

By 1900 there were occasional requests for New Zealand passports, which were personally signed by the Governor. In 1905 MP [[George Fowlds]] decided to return to Scotland for his father's 100th birthday. He decided he needed a passport when his ship was about to leave; an inconvenience both for the department and the Governor who had to sign it. A single passport covered a man and his wife and children, but did not include a photo or any personal details like age, height, or eye colour.{{sfn|Bassett|1997|p=57}}\n\nIn the First World War the British Government required passports in 1915, and New Zealand followed from November 1915, with an increased workload for the department and for police. 1,108 passports had been issued in 1909, but 6,000 were issued in the nine months from 15 November 1915 to 21 August 1916. The number was kept high by civilian travel after the war, over 4,300 in 1921, and the number hovered at that level until the Depression. The number then fell from 4,722 in 1930 to 2,455 for the year ended 31 March 1934.{{sfn|Bassett|1997|p=75, 97}}\n\n=== 1950s: New Zealand citizenship introduced ===\nAfter the creation of modern [[New Zealand nationality law|New Zealand citizenship]] with the passing of the British Nationality and New Zealand Citizenship Act, 1948 (which came into force on 1 January 1949), residence in New Zealand no longer qualified British or Commonwealth citizens for a New Zealand passport, and they had to apply for New Zealand citizenship then for a passport, with increased work for the   [[Department of Internal Affairs (New Zealand)|Department of Internal Affairs]]. In 1950 the number of passports issued topped ten thousand, twice as many as were issued in 1939.{{sfn|Bassett|1997|p=150}} Between 1948 and 1977, New Zealand passports bore the words 'New Zealand citizen and British subject'.<ref>[http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/citizenship/2/3]</ref>\n\nStarting on 1 July 1981, the [[Fraser Government]] announced that New Zealand citizens could no longer travel to Australia without passports, as it was felt that too many people who were not entitled to travel without passports to Australia were passing themselves off as New Zealanders.<ref>[http://www.dfat.gov.au/fta/anzcerta/documents/02ttta.pdf]</ref><ref>[http://www.australianreview.net/journal/v2/n1/goff.pdf]</ref>\n\n=== 1990s: Machine-readable passports introduced ===\nIn 1992, the Department of Internal Affairs started issuing [[machine-readable passport]]s in New Zealand, whilst New Zealand overseas posts continued to issue manual passports. Since 24 February 1992, children's names have no longer been endorsed in the passports of their parents. In February 1997, the [[New Zealand House|New Zealand High Commission]] in [[London]] began issuing machine readable passports.<ref>[http://www.dia.govt.nz/Pubforms.nsf/URL/anreport97.pdf/$file/anreport97.pdf Department of Internal Affairs Annual Report 1996-1997]</ref>\n\nIn December 2000, [[French language|French]] was removed from the biodata page of the New Zealand passport and replaced with [[M\u0101ori language|M\u0101ori]] - this change was brought about by the Department of Internal Affairs to reflect the status of Te Reo M\u0101ori as an official language of New Zealand and to give \"New Zealanders travelling abroad a passport that more accurately reflects their national identity\".<ref name=\"DIA01report\">[http://www.dia.govt.nz/Pubforms.NSF/URL/DIAANNUALREPORT.pdf/$file/DIAANNUALREPORT.pdf Department of Internal Affairs Annual Report 2000-2001]</ref>\n\nIn 2001, the Department of Internal Affairs took over responsibility for the London Passport Office from the [[New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade|Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade]].<ref>[http://www.dia.govt.nz/Pubforms.NSF/URL/anreport00.pdf/$file/anreport00.pdf Department of Internal Affairs Annual Report 1999-2000]</ref>\n\n=== 2000s: Non-machine-readable passports phased out ===\nBy 2003, only around 4% of all New Zealand passport holders still held a non-machine readable version.<ref>[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=3522762]</ref>\n\nOn 26 October 2004, New Zealand diplomatic posts stopped issuing manual passports and, on the same day, began issuing short-term machine-readable emergency travel documents for New Zealand citizens who need to travel urgently.<ref>[http://www.nzembassy.com/china/nzers-overseas/nz-documents/issuing-renewing-and-extending-passports]</ref><ref>[http://www.dia.govt.nz/diawebsite.nsf/c021d9ab485d28b3cc256ab800742a8e/84d6d40ee50f1869cc25719c005fecb9!OpenDocument]</ref> One of the reasons for reducing the number of non-machine readable passports in circulation was to increase the security of New Zealand passports; another was that, starting on this day, New Zealanders travelling to the United States under the [[Visa Waiver Program]] were required to enter on a machine readable passport.<ref>[http://www.nzembassy.com/canada/new-zealanders-overseas/new-zealand-documents/machine-readable-passports]</ref>\n\nFrom this date onwards, all New Zealand citizens applying for a passport overseas have had to send their application to the Passport Office in New Zealand, [[Sydney]] or London. It also meant that all New Zealand passports issued on or after 26 October 2004 were machine-readable. Remaining non-machine readable New Zealand passports (M series) were still valid and expired by 25 October 2014 at the latest (only around 2% of New Zealand passport holders still had a non-machine readable version as of that date).<ref>[http://www.dia.govt.nz/diawebsite.nsf/ad46619e19fa042bcc256a8a0001c7b4/316a11c6cb57d307cc256e1600147a21!OpenDocument]</ref>\n\n=== 2005: Biometric passports introduced, and validity reduced to 5 years ===\nOn 4 November 2005, the Department of Internal Affairs began issuing New Zealand [[biometric passport]]s (EA series).<ref>[http://tvnz.co.nz/view/page/411749/624350 TVNZ: Government introduces e-passport]</ref> In order to cover the higher costs associated with the production of biometric passports (compared with the previous machine readable passports), the application cost increased from NZ$71 to NZ$150 for adults and from NZ$36 to NZ$80 for children.<ref>[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10353512 NZ Herald: Microchips in passports double price]</ref>\n\nAll passports issued from 24 April 2005 to 29 November 2015 - both adult and child - have a maximum [[passport validity]] of five years as a result of the Passports Amendment Act (2005). Passports that were issued prior to 24 April 2005 remained valid until the date of expiry as stated on the biodata page. From 24 April 2005, New Zealand passports were no longer endorsed with name changes, which meant that, for example, changing to a married name required applying for a new passport.\n\n=== 2009: New passport design introduced ===\nOn 23 November 2009, the Department of Internal Affairs launched a new (and the current) version of the biometric passport (LA series), supplied under a contract with the [[Canadian Bank Note Company]] at a cost of just under $100 million over five years. One of the motivations for a new passport design was to ensure that it would remain difficult to produce counterfeit New Zealand passports.<ref>[http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PA0911/S00319.htm]</ref> Unlike the previous biometric passport, photographs on the biodata page are now laser engraved in black and white for extra security.<ref name=\"tvnz.co.nz\">[http://tvnz.co.nz/travel-news/kiwi-passport-gets-makeover-3174084]</ref>\n\n=== 2014: Passport validity increased to 10 years again ===\nOn 29 May 2014, after considering the Petition of [[Kyle Lockwood]], the Government Administration Committee recommended to the New Zealand government that ten-year passports for adults be reinstated. The committee concluded  \n\"On the evidence received, we are not convinced that the reduction in detected fraudulent passports is a result of the shorter validity period. It seems more likely to us that the introduction of biometric passports has lessened fraud and counterfeiting. The international standard among countries such as Australia, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States of America, who use similar biometric passports, is ten years. The biometric security features have led countries such as China, Canada and the Netherlands to reintroduce ten-year passports. We support the intent of the petition.\"\n<ref>[http://www.parliament.nz/en-nz/pb/sc/documents/reports/50DBSCH_SCR6229_1/petition-201197-of-kyle-lockwood]</ref> Law changes were passed in 2015 and since 30 November 2015, 10-year passports are available again for New Zealanders aged 16 and over;

The Department of Internal Affairs issues passports from its offices in [[Auckland]], [[Christchurch]] and [[Wellington]] in New Zealand, as well as overseas offices in Sydney and London. New Zealand embassies, [[High Commission]]s and consulates outside of Sydney and London are not able to issue passports, although diplomatic officers may be able to provide application forms and assist in communicating with an issuing office.\n\nAdult passports now can be applied through online for both first time and renewals. Standard processing time is up to 10 working days plus delivery, unless an urgent or call-out service is requested. There are online fees for Australia and the UK as well as New Zealand.\n\nAs of January 2020, a standard passport costs $191 for adults and $111 for children, including delivery within New Zealand. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.passports.govt.nz/passport-costs/|title=Passport Costs|last=|first=|date=|website=Passport Office, Department of Internal Affairs|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n===Urgent travel===\nIn emergencies, some New Zealand embassies, High Commissions and consulates may be able to issue an '''Emergency Travel Document''' with a validity of only one year intended to assist New Zealand citizens who do not have the time to obtain a passport in time to travel. An application for a New Zealand Emergency Travel Document (ETD) costs NZ$350 and includes the fee for a full replacement passport before the expiration of the ETD.<ref>[http://www.passports.govt.nz/Fees-and-charges---emergency-travel-documents Fees and charges - emergency travel documents]</ref> In countries where there is no New Zealand diplomatic post, New Zealand citizens who need to travel urgently and whose passport has expired, been lost or been stolen can be issued with an [[British emergency passport|Emergency Travel Document]] at a cost of \u00a395 by a British foreign mission as long as this has been cleared with the [[New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110703121543/http://centralcontent.fco.gov.uk/resources/en/pdf/central-content-pdfs/5619320/etd-leaflet.pdf Foreign & Commonwealth Office: The new UK Emergency Passport]</ref>\n\n===Endorsement indicating New Zealand citizenship===\nAs an alternative to obtaining a New Zealand passport, New Zealand citizens with another nationality and a foreign passport/travel document can apply for an endorsement indicating New Zealand citizenship from [[Immigration New Zealand]] (INZ). The endorsement can either be physically affixed inside the foreign passport/travel document or can be electronically linked in INZ's database to the foreign passport/travel document. An endorsement indicating New Zealand citizenship is valid for the duration of the foreign passport/travel document it is endorsed in or electronically linked to. An endorsement indicating New Zealand citizenship costs NZ$130 for first time applications and NZ$80 for subsequent applications, which means that it is cheaper than obtaining a regular adult New Zealand passport. The fee for the endorsement is completely waived if electronically linked to or affixed inside a passport issued by [[Austrian passport|Austria]], [[Finnish passport|Finland]], [[Greek passport|Greece]], [[Icelandic passport|Iceland]], [[Israeli passport|Israel]], [[Italian passport|Italy]] or [[Turkish passport|Turkey]].<ref>[http://www.immigration.govt.nz/NR/rdonlyres/00B58004-04AB-46C6-B32B-5CE91FBA979A/0/1028.pdf Immigration New Zealand: Fees Guide] (Note that although Japan is listed, in practice in most cases this will not apply as Japan has [[Japanese nationality law#Dual nationality|restrictive rules]] relating to dual nationality.)</ref> Given that the maximum validity of New Zealand passports is 10 years for adults and 5 years for under 16 year olds, an endorsement indicating New Zealand citizenship may work out to be an even more economic option if affixed inside or linked electronically to a foreign passport/travel document which has a longer validity (e.g. 10 years). It is also easier to obtain an endorsement indicating New Zealand citizenship than a New Zealand passport overseas, since an endorsement can be issued at INZ offices in [[Apia]], [[Bangkok]], [[Beijing]], [[Ho Chi Minh City]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Jakarta]], London, [[Moscow]], [[Mumbai]], [[New Delhi]], [[Nuku\u2019alofa]], [[Pretoria]], [[Shanghai]], [[Singapore]], [[Suva]], Sydney and [[Taipei]], whilst New Zealand passports are only issued overseas by the [[Department of Internal Affairs]] in Sydney and London.  However, New Zealand citizens with dual/multiple nationality travelling on a passport/travel document issued by another country may be unable to access New Zealand consular assistance whilst overseas and may not be able to enjoy as many visa exemptions. For example, a dual New Zealand and [[Samoan nationality law|Samoan]] citizen travelling only on a [[Samoan passport]] with an endorsement indicating New Zealand citizenship affixed inside is unable to obtain a [[Special Category Visa]] (SCV) upon arrival in Australia and must obtain an Australian visitor visa before travelling, since to obtain an SCV a New Zealand citizen must present a valid New Zealand passport.\n\n===Return travel to New Zealand without a passport===\n\nIn general, to establish his/her right to enter New Zealand, a New Zealand citizen is required to present a valid New Zealand passport or a passport issued by another country that is electronically linked or physically affixed with an endorsement indicating New Zealand citizenship.\n\nHowever, a New Zealand embassy, high commission or consulate or an [[Immigration New Zealand]] branch can request that the immigration officer at a port of entry in New Zealand not demand to see a passport of a New Zealand citizen in urgent or compassionate circumstances (e.g. death or serious illness) where there is not enough time for a New Zealand passport to be issued.<ref>http://www.immigration.govt.nz/opsmanual/i35031.htm</ref>\n\n==Physical appearance==\n\n===Cover===\nThe current version of New Zealand passports issued since November 2009 are black, with the [[Coat of Arms of New Zealand|New Zealand coat of arms]] emblazoned in silver in the centre of the front cover. The words '''\"NEW ZEALAND PASSPORT\"''' and '''\"URUWHENUA AOTEAROA\"''' are inscribed above the coat of arms in silver. The standard biometric symbol appears at the bottom of the front cover. Both the front and back covers have silver [[fern]]s embossed on the outside edge.\n\nRegular passports issued prior to November 2009 had a navy blue cover.\n\n===Passport note===\nPassports contain a note from the issuing state that is addressed to the authorities of all other states, identifying the bearer as a citizen of that state and requesting that he or she be allowed to pass and be treated according to international norms. The note inside New Zealand passports states:\n\n:''The [[Governor-General of New Zealand|Governor-General]] in the Realm of New Zealand requests in the Name of [[Monarchy of New Zealand|Her Majesty The Queen]] all whom it may concern to allow the holder to pass without delay or hindrance and in case of need to give all lawful assistance and protection.''\n\nand in M\u0101ori:\n\n:''He tono t\u0113nei n\u0101 te K\u0101wana-Tianara O te Whenua o Aotearoa i raro i te Ingoa o Kuini Erih\u0101peti ki te hunga e tika ana kia kaua e akut\u014dtia, e whakak\u014dpekatia te tangata mau i te uruwhenua nei i ana haere, \u0101, i te w\u0101 e hiahiatia ai me \u0101whina, me manaaki.''\n\n===Languages===\nThe textual portions of New Zealand passports are printed in both English and M\u0101ori.

By 1900 there were occasional requests for New Zealand passports, which were personally signed by the Governor. In 1905 MP [[George Fowlds]] decided to return to Scotland for his father's 100th birthday. He decided he needed a passport when his ship was about to leave; an inconvenience both for the department and the Governor who had to sign it. A single passport covered a man and his wife and children, but did not include a photo or any personal details like age, height, or eye colour.{{sfn|Bassett|1997|p=57}}\n\nIn the First World War the British Government required passports in 1915, and New Zealand followed from November 1915, with an increased workload for the department and for police. 1,108 passports had been issued in 1909, but 6,000 were issued in the nine months from 15 November 1915 to 21 August 1916. The number was kept high by civilian travel after the war, over 4,300 in 1921, and the number hovered at that level until the Depression. The number then fell from 4,722 in 1930 to 2,455 for the year ended 31 March 1934.{{sfn|Bassett|1997|p=75, 97}}\n\n=== 1950s: New Zealand citizenship introduced ===\nAfter the creation of modern [[New Zealand nationality law|New Zealand citizenship]] with the passing of the British Nationality and New Zealand Citizenship Act, 1948 (which came into force on 1 January 1949), residence in New Zealand no longer qualified British or Commonwealth citizens for a New Zealand passport, and they had to apply for New Zealand citizenship then for a passport, with increased work for the   [[Department of Internal Affairs (New Zealand)|Department of Internal Affairs]]. In 1950 the number of passports issued topped ten thousand, twice as many as were issued in 1939.{{sfn|Bassett|1997|p=150}} Between 1948 and 1977, New Zealand passports bore the words 'New Zealand citizen and British subject'.<ref>[http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/citizenship/2/3]</ref>\n\nStarting on 1 July 1981, the [[Fraser Government]] announced that New Zealand citizens could no longer travel to Australia without passports, as it was felt that too many people who were not entitled to travel without passports to Australia were passing themselves off as New Zealanders.<ref>[http://www.dfat.gov.au/fta/anzcerta/documents/02ttta.pdf]</ref><ref>[http://www.australianreview.net/journal/v2/n1/goff.pdf]</ref>\n\n=== 1990s: Machine-readable passports introduced ===\nIn 1992, the Department of Internal Affairs started issuing [[machine-readable passport]]s in New Zealand, whilst New Zealand overseas posts continued to issue manual passports. Since 24 February 1992, children's names have no longer been endorsed in the passports of their parents. In February 1997, the [[New Zealand House|New Zealand High Commission]] in [[London]] began issuing machine readable passports.<ref>[http://www.dia.govt.nz/Pubforms.nsf/URL/anreport97.pdf/$file/anreport97.pdf Department of Internal Affairs Annual Report 1996-1997]</ref>\n\nIn December 2000, [[French language|French]] was removed from the biodata page of the New Zealand passport and replaced with [[M\u0101ori language|M\u0101ori]] - this change was brought about by the Department of Internal Affairs to reflect the status of Te Reo M\u0101ori as an official language of New Zealand and to give \"New Zealanders travelling abroad a passport that more accurately reflects their national identity\".<ref name=\"DIA01report\">[http://www.dia.govt.nz/Pubforms.NSF/URL/DIAANNUALREPORT.pdf/$file/DIAANNUALREPORT.pdf Department of Internal Affairs Annual Report 2000-2001]</ref>\n\nIn 2001, the Department of Internal Affairs took over responsibility for the London Passport Office from the [[New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade|Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade]].<ref>[http://www.dia.govt.nz/Pubforms.NSF/URL/anreport00.pdf/$file/anreport00.pdf Department of Internal Affairs Annual Report 1999-2000]</ref>\n\n=== 2000s: Non-machine-readable passports phased out ===\nBy 2003, only around 4% of all New Zealand passport holders still held a non-machine readable version.<ref>[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=3522762]</ref>\n\nOn 26 October 2004, New Zealand diplomatic posts stopped issuing manual passports and, on the same day, began issuing short-term machine-readable emergency travel documents for New Zealand citizens who need to travel urgently.<ref>[http://www.nzembassy.com/china/nzers-overseas/nz-documents/issuing-renewing-and-extending-passports]</ref><ref>[http://www.dia.govt.nz/diawebsite.nsf/c021d9ab485d28b3cc256ab800742a8e/84d6d40ee50f1869cc25719c005fecb9!OpenDocument]</ref> One of the reasons for reducing the number of non-machine readable passports in circulation was to increase the security of New Zealand passports; another was that, starting on this day, New Zealanders travelling to the United States under the [[Visa Waiver Program]] were required to enter on a machine readable passport.<ref>[http://www.nzembassy.com/canada/new-zealanders-overseas/new-zealand-documents/machine-readable-passports]</ref>\n\nFrom this date onwards, all New Zealand citizens applying for a passport overseas have had to send their application to the Passport Office in New Zealand, [[Sydney]] or London. It also meant that all New Zealand passports issued on or after 26 October 2004 were machine-readable. Remaining non-machine readable New Zealand passports (M series) were still valid and expired by 25 October 2014 at the latest (only around 2% of New Zealand passport holders still had a non-machine readable version as of that date).<ref>[http://www.dia.govt.nz/diawebsite.nsf/ad46619e19fa042bcc256a8a0001c7b4/316a11c6cb57d307cc256e1600147a21!OpenDocument]</ref>\n\n=== 2005: Biometric passports introduced, and validity reduced to 5 years ===\nOn 4 November 2005, the Department of Internal Affairs began issuing New Zealand [[biometric passport]]s (EA series).<ref>[http://tvnz.co.nz/view/page/411749/624350 TVNZ: Government introduces e-passport]</ref> In order to cover the higher costs associated with the production of biometric passports (compared with the previous machine readable passports), the application cost increased from NZ$71 to NZ$150 for adults and from NZ$36 to NZ$80 for children.<ref>[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10353512 NZ Herald: Microchips in passports double price]</ref>\n\nAll passports issued from 24 April 2005 to 29 November 2015 - both adult and child - have a maximum [[passport validity]] of five years as a result of the Passports Amendment Act (2005). Passports that were issued prior to 24 April 2005 remained valid until the date of expiry as stated on the biodata page. From 24 April 2005, New Zealand passports were no longer endorsed with name changes, which meant that, for example, changing to a married name required applying for a new passport.\n\n=== 2009: New passport design introduced ===\nOn 23 November 2009, the Department of Internal Affairs launched a new (and the current) version of the biometric passport (LA series), supplied under a contract with the [[Canadian Bank Note Company]] at a cost of just under $100 million over five years. One of the motivations for a new passport design was to ensure that it would remain difficult to produce counterfeit New Zealand passports.<ref>[http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PA0911/S00319.htm]</ref> Unlike the previous biometric passport, photographs on the biodata page are now laser engraved in black and white for extra security.<ref name=\"tvnz.co.nz\">[http://tvnz.co.nz/travel-news/kiwi-passport-gets-makeover-3174084]</ref>\n\n=== 2014: Passport validity increased to 10 years again ===\nOn 29 May 2014, after considering the Petition of [[Kyle Lockwood]], the Government Administration Committee recommended to the New Zealand government that ten-year passports for adults be reinstated. The committee concluded  \n\"On the evidence received, we are not convinced that the reduction in detected fraudulent passports is a result of the shorter validity period. It seems more likely to us that the introduction of biometric passports has lessened fraud and counterfeiting. The international standard among countries such as Australia, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States of America, who use similar biometric passports, is ten years. The biometric security features have led countries such as China, Canada and the Netherlands to reintroduce ten-year passports. We support the intent of the petition.\"\n<ref>[http://www.parliament.nz/en-nz/pb/sc/documents/reports/50DBSCH_SCR6229_1/petition-201197-of-kyle-lockwood]</ref> Law changes were passed in 2015 and since 30 November 2015, 10-year passports are available again for New Zealanders aged 16 and over;

The Department of Internal Affairs issues passports from its offices in [[Auckland]], [[Christchurch]] and [[Wellington]] in New Zealand, as well as overseas offices in Sydney and London. New Zealand embassies, [[High Commission]]s and consulates outside of Sydney and London are not able to issue passports, although diplomatic officers may be able to provide application forms and assist in communicating with an issuing office.\n\nAdult passports now can be applied through online for both first time and renewals. Standard processing time is up to 10 working days plus delivery, unless an urgent or call-out service is requested. There are online fees for Australia and the UK as well as New Zealand.\n\nAs of January 2020, a standard passport costs $191 for adults and $111 for children, including delivery within New Zealand. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.passports.govt.nz/passport-costs/|title=Passport Costs|last=|first=|date=|website=Passport Office, Department of Internal Affairs|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n===Urgent travel===\nIn emergencies, some New Zealand embassies, High Commissions and consulates may be able to issue an '''Emergency Travel Document''' with a validity of only one year intended to assist New Zealand citizens who do not have the time to obtain a passport in time to travel. An application for a New Zealand Emergency Travel Document (ETD) costs NZ$350 and includes the fee for a full replacement passport before the expiration of the ETD.<ref>[http://www.passports.govt.nz/Fees-and-charges---emergency-travel-documents Fees and charges - emergency travel documents]</ref> In countries where there is no New Zealand diplomatic post, New Zealand citizens who need to travel urgently and whose passport has expired, been lost or been stolen can be issued with an [[British emergency passport|Emergency Travel Document]] at a cost of \u00a395 by a British foreign mission as long as this has been cleared with the [[New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110703121543/http://centralcontent.fco.gov.uk/resources/en/pdf/central-content-pdfs/5619320/etd-leaflet.pdf Foreign & Commonwealth Office: The new UK Emergency Passport]</ref>\n\n===Endorsement indicating New Zealand citizenship===\nAs an alternative to obtaining a New Zealand passport, New Zealand citizens with another nationality and a foreign passport/travel document can apply for an endorsement indicating New Zealand citizenship from [[Immigration New Zealand]] (INZ). The endorsement can either be physically affixed inside the foreign passport/travel document or can be electronically linked in INZ's database to the foreign passport/travel document. An endorsement indicating New Zealand citizenship is valid for the duration of the foreign passport/travel document it is endorsed in or electronically linked to. An endorsement indicating New Zealand citizenship costs NZ$130 for first time applications and NZ$80 for subsequent applications, which means that it is cheaper than obtaining a regular adult New Zealand passport. The fee for the endorsement is completely waived if electronically linked to or affixed inside a passport issued by [[Austrian passport|Austria]], [[Finnish passport|Finland]], [[Greek passport|Greece]], [[Icelandic passport|Iceland]], [[Israeli passport|Israel]], [[Italian passport|Italy]] or [[Turkish passport|Turkey]].<ref>[http://www.immigration.govt.nz/NR/rdonlyres/00B58004-04AB-46C6-B32B-5CE91FBA979A/0/1028.pdf Immigration New Zealand: Fees Guide] (Note that although Japan is listed, in practice in most cases this will not apply as Japan has [[Japanese nationality law#Dual nationality|restrictive rules]] relating to dual nationality.)</ref> Given that the maximum validity of New Zealand passports is 10 years for adults and 5 years for under 16 year olds, an endorsement indicating New Zealand citizenship may work out to be an even more economic option if affixed inside or linked electronically to a foreign passport/travel document which has a longer validity (e.g. 10 years). It is also easier to obtain an endorsement indicating New Zealand citizenship than a New Zealand passport overseas, since an endorsement can be issued at INZ offices in [[Apia]], [[Bangkok]], [[Beijing]], [[Ho Chi Minh City]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Jakarta]], London, [[Moscow]], [[Mumbai]], [[New Delhi]], [[Nuku\u2019alofa]], [[Pretoria]], [[Shanghai]], [[Singapore]], [[Suva]], Sydney and [[Taipei]], whilst New Zealand passports are only issued overseas by the [[Department of Internal Affairs]] in Sydney and London.  However, New Zealand citizens with dual/multiple nationality travelling on a passport/travel document issued by another country may be unable to access New Zealand consular assistance whilst overseas and may not be able to enjoy as many visa exemptions. For example, a dual New Zealand and [[Samoan nationality law|Samoan]] citizen travelling only on a [[Samoan passport]] with an endorsement indicating New Zealand citizenship affixed inside is unable to obtain a [[Special Category Visa]] (SCV) upon arrival in Australia and must obtain an Australian visitor visa before travelling, since to obtain an SCV a New Zealand citizen must present a valid New Zealand passport.\n\n===Return travel to New Zealand without a passport===\n\nIn general, to establish his/her right to enter New Zealand, a New Zealand citizen is required to present a valid New Zealand passport or a passport issued by another country that is electronically linked or physically affixed with an endorsement indicating New Zealand citizenship.\n\nHowever, a New Zealand embassy, high commission or consulate or an [[Immigration New Zealand]] branch can request that the immigration officer at a port of entry in New Zealand not demand to see a passport of a New Zealand citizen in urgent or compassionate circumstances (e.g. death or serious illness) where there is not enough time for a New Zealand passport to be issued.<ref>http://www.immigration.govt.nz/opsmanual/i35031.htm</ref>\n\n==Physical appearance==\n\n===Cover===\nThe current version of New Zealand passports issued since November 2009 are black, with the [[Coat of Arms of New Zealand|New Zealand coat of arms]] emblazoned in silver in the centre of the front cover. The words '''\"NEW ZEALAND PASSPORT\"''' and '''\"URUWHENUA AOTEAROA\"''' are inscribed above the coat of arms in silver. The standard biometric symbol appears at the bottom of the front cover. Both the front and back covers have silver [[fern]]s embossed on the outside edge.\n\nRegular passports issued prior to November 2009 had a navy blue cover.\n\n===Passport note===\nPassports contain a note from the issuing state that is addressed to the authorities of all other states, identifying the bearer as a citizen of that state and requesting that he or she be allowed to pass and be treated according to international norms. The note inside New Zealand passports states:\n\n:''The [[Governor-General of New Zealand|Governor-General]] in the Realm of New Zealand requests in the Name of [[Monarchy of New Zealand|Her Majesty The Queen]] all whom it may concern to allow the holder to pass without delay or hindrance and in case of need to give all lawful assistance and protection.''\n\nand in M\u0101ori:\n\n:''He tono t\u0113nei n\u0101 te K\u0101wana-Tianara O te Whenua o Aotearoa i raro i te Ingoa o Kuini Erih\u0101peti ki te hunga e tika ana kia kaua e akut\u014dtia, e whakak\u014dpekatia te tangata mau i te uruwhenua nei i ana haere, \u0101, i te w\u0101 e hiahiatia ai me \u0101whina, me manaaki.''\n\n===Languages===\nThe textual portions of New Zealand passports are printed in both English and M\u0101ori. (Previously English and French.)\n\n===Biodata page===\n[[File:NZpassportpage.jpg|right|upright=2.3|thumb|Design of the biodata page]]\n\nThe biodata page of the current version of the New Zealand passport includes the following data:\n\n*Photo of the passport holder (in black and white)\n*Type (''Momo''): P\n*Issuing state (''Whenua''): NZL\n*Passport No. (''Tau Uruwhenua'')\n*Surname (''Ingoa wh\u0101nau'')\n*Given names (''Ingoa \u0101ke'')\n*Nationality (''Iwi t\u016bturu''): NEW ZEALAND\n*Date of birth (''R\u0101 wh\u0101nau'')\n*Sex (''T\u0101ne-Wahine'')\n*Place of birth (''W\u0101hi wh\u0101nau'') (Passports issued after December 2005 will only include the city of birth)\n*Date of issue (''R\u0101 timatanga'')\n*Date of expiry (''R\u0101 mutunga'')\n*Authority (''Te Mana Tuku'')\n\nThe information page ends with the [[Machine Readable Zone]].\n\n==Law==\nUnder the Passports Act 1992, the Minister of Internal Affairs has the power to refuse a passport, for example, on grounds of national security.\n\nThe Minister also has the discretion to issue a passport for less than the current ten-year validity period.\n\n==Incidents==\n\n===Use by Israeli government===\n{{main|2004 Israel\u2013New Zealand passport scandal}}\n\nIn 2004, two Israelis, suspected agents working for [[Mossad]], Eli Cara and Uriel Kelman, were convicted and jailed for attempting to obtain New Zealand passports by submitting [[passport fraud|fraudulent applications]].

It centers on a hopeful actress who won a role in a film that takes her, the cast, and the crew to a hotel where the present soon collides with the past.\n\nIt was released as a part of the six-volume [[J-Horror Theater]].\n\n==Plot==\nA number of people see visions of apparently dead people: a businessman finds one behind him in an elevator and a truck driver runs over one on the road.\n\nProfessor Norihasa Omori visits a local hotel and films himself killing eleven of the hotel guests, employees, and his own children before committing suicide, all as part of his wish to understand [[reincarnation]]. The footage of the murders disappears. Thirty-five years later, horror movie director Ikuo Matsumura decides to make a film about the massacre. As the date of the shoot draws near, Nagisa Sugiura ([[Y\u016bka (actress)|Y\u016bka]]), the actress set to star as Omori's daughter Chisato, is haunted by the ghosts of the victims. She begins hallucinating and is plagued by nightmares of the killings. She discovers an old film camera which is the same type the professor had used.\n\nYayoi Kinoshita ([[Karina Nose]]), a college student, meets Yuka Morita ([[Marika Matsumoto]]), an actress who had auditioned for Ikuo's movie. Yuka says she remembers things in a \"past life\" and shows Yayoi a [[birthmark]] that looks like evidence of strangulation. Ghosts later drag Yuka away. Yayoi's research takes her to the only survivor of the attack: Ayumi Omori, the professor's wife. She explains that he had become obsessed with the idea that the body is just a vessel.\n\nDuring filming, Nagisa starts hallucinating. Nagisa's agent reviews the camera, which consists of the film the professor took as he committed the murders. As this film plays, Nagisa reenacts the events in her hallucination. She witnesses the actors, including Yayoi and the director, and the two men in the start of the movie, all transform into the people they portray. With the victims walking toward her, she escapes and runs into the town. Simultaneously, her agent watches the film of this escape from the professor's POV. Nagisa finds herself cornered in a store and grabs a piece of glass to kill herself. She looks at her reflection and sees the face of the professor. Her agent watches the professor in his film reveal Nagisa's reflection instead of his own in the glass, before he cuts his own throat. Nagisa starts to reenact the professor's suicide but the doll stops her to tell her they will be together forever.\n\nA group of executives watch Nagisa's take. Among them is the professor's wife. Near the end, Nagisa collapses, shaking and screaming as crew members come to her aid. By the professor's wife are her two children and the wife smiles. Sometime later, in a mental ward, Nagisa is bound in a full-body wrap and still haunted by the souls of Omori's children. The professor's wife looks at her through the door window, then passes her children's favourite toys through to Nagisa: a red ball and the doll. Nagisa screams but eventually calms down with a sinister smile as the ghosts of the children close in on her.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Y\u016bka (actress)|Y\u016bka]] as Nagisa Sugiura\n* [[Karina Nose]] as Yayoi Kinoshita\n* [[Kippei Shiina]] as Ikuo Matsumura\n* [[Tetta Sugimoto]] as Tadashi Murakawa\n* [[Marika Matsumoto]] as Yuka Morita\n* [[Shun Oguri]] as Kazuya Onishi\n* Mantaro Koichi as Producer Yamanaka\n* Atsushi Haruta as Norihasa Omori\n* Miki Sanjo as Ayumi Omori\n** Younger version portrayed by [[Tomoko Mochizuki]]\n* Mao Sasaki as Chisato Omori\n* Hiroto Ito as Yuya Omori\n* [[Takako Fuji]] as Takako Sudo (Hotel Maid)\n* Shinji Nomura as Naoto Takada (Hotel Owner)\n* Yuki Shiomi as Yuta Inomata (Receptionist)\n* Izumi Kyoko as Kaoru Shintani (Hotel Maid 2)\n* Yasutoki Furuya as Atsushi Ozawa (Waiter, Chef)\n* Harada as M.
