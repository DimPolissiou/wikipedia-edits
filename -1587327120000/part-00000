The term may refer to any belief about the nature of [[Jesus]] [[Christ]] that affirms [[God]] as a singular entity and rejects the doctrine of the [[Trinity]], as affirmed by the [[Nicene Creed|mainstream Christianity]]: a consensus of Christian bishops at the [[First Council of Nicaea]] in 325. Nontrinitarianism was especially prevalent during the theological turmoils of the [[Protestant Reformation]]. A Spanish physician, [[Michael Servetus]], studied the Bible and concluded that the concept of the Trinity, as traditionally conceived, was not biblical. His books ''On the Errors of the Trinity'' and ''Christianismi Restitutio'' caused much uproar. Servetus was eventually arrested, convicted of heresy, and burned at the stake in [[Geneva]] in 1553.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.miguelservet.org/servetus/biography.htm |title=Michael Servetus Institute; Times that Servetus lived |publisher=Miguelservet.org |accessdate=2011-02-27}}</ref>\n\nThe term \"Unitarian\" entered the English language via [[Henry Hedworth]], who applied it to the teachings of [[Laelio Sozzini]] and the Polish [[Socinians]]. Unitarian churches were formally established in [[Transylvania]] and [[Poland]] (by the [[Socinianism|Socinians]]) in the second half of the 16th century.<ref name=\"Harris\">Harris, MW. Unitarian Universalist Origins: Our Historic Faith</ref> There, the first doctrines of religious freedom in Europe were established (in the course of several diets between 1557 and 1568, see [[Edict of Torda]]) under the jurisdiction of [[John Sigismund Z\u00e1polya|John Sigismund]], king of Hungary and Prince of Transylvania, the only Unitarian monarch. The early Unitarian church not only rejected the Trinity, but also the [[pre-existence of Christ]] as well as, in many cases, [[predestination]] and [[original sin]] as put forward by [[Augustine of Hippo]], and the [[substitutionary atonement]] of Christ developed by [[Anselm of Canterbury]] and John Calvin. There were several different forms of [[Christology]] in the beginnings of the Unitarian movement; ultimately, the dominant Christology became [[psilanthropism]]: that Jesus was a man, but one with a unique relationship to God.\n\n====Britain====\n{{main|History of Unitarianism}}\nInfluenced by the teachings of the Polish [[Socinians]], [[Samuel Clarke]] (1675\u20131729) revised the ''[[Book of Common Prayer]]'', removing the Trinitarian [[Nicene Creed]] and references to [[divinity of Jesus|Jesus as God]].<ref name=Clarke>{{cite web|url=http://www.americanunitarian.org/fisherhistory.htm |title=Chris Fisher, ''A Brief History of Unitarian Christianity'', retrieved July 18, 2008 |publisher=Americanunitarian.org |accessdate=2011-02-27}}</ref> [[Theophilus Lindsey]] also revised the ''Book of Common Prayer'' to allow a more tolerant, free Unitarian interpretation. Neither cleric was charged under the [[Blasphemy Act 1697]] that made it an \"offense for any person, educated in or having made profession of the Christian religion, by writing, preaching, teaching or advised speaking, to deny the [[Holy Trinity]]\". The [[Act of Toleration 1689|Act of Toleration]] (1689) gave relief to [[English Dissenters]], but excluded Unitarians. The efforts of Clarke and Lindsey met with substantial criticism from the more conservative clergy and laity of the [[Church of England]]. In response, in 1774, Lindsey applied for registration of the [[Essex Street Chapel|Essex House]] as a \"Dissenting place of worship\" with the assistance of [[barrister]] [[John Lee (Attorney-General)|John Lee]].<ref>{{cite web|title=1959_StoryEssexHall.pdf|first=Mortimer|last=Rowe|location=London|publisher=Lindsey Press}}</ref>  On the Sunday following the registration\u2014April 17, 1774\u2014the first true Unitarian congregation discreetly convened in the provisional Essex Street Chapel.

The official statement of Unitarian Universalist principles describes the \"sources\" upon which current practice is based:<ref name=sources/>{{quotation|\n* Direct experience of that transcending mystery and wonder, affirmed in all cultures, which moves us to a renewal of the spirit and an openness to the forces which create and uphold life;\n* Words and deeds of prophetic people which challenge us to confront powers and structures of evil with justice, compassion, and the transforming power of love;\n* Wisdom from the [[Major religious groups|world's religions]] which inspires us in our ethical and spiritual life;\n* Jewish and Christian teachings which call us to respond to God's love by loving our neighbors as ourselves;\n* [[Humanism|Humanist]] teachings which counsel us to heed the guidance of reason and the results of science, and warn us against idolatries of the mind and spirit.\n* Spiritual teachings of [[Earth religion|earth-centered traditions]] which celebrate the sacred circle of life and instruct us to live in harmony with the rhythms of nature.}}\n\nUnitarian Universalist principles and purposes have been modified over time to manifest a broader acceptance of beliefs and traditions among the membership. The seventh Principle (adopted in 1985), \"Respect for the interdependent web of all existence of which we are a part\", and a sixth Source (adopted in 1995), \"Spiritual teachings of earth-centered traditions which celebrate the sacred circle of life and instruct us to live in harmony with the rhythms of nature\" were added to explicitly include members with [[Modern Paganism|neopagan]], [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]], and [[Pantheism|pantheist]] spiritualities.<ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://www.uuworld.org/ideas/articles/3643.shtml?lj\n | title = Shared values: How the UUA's Principles and Purposes were shaped and how they've shaped Unitarian Universalism\n | accessdate = 2007-02-24\n | author = Warren R.

Today, the Unitarian Universalist approach to the [[Bible|Christian Bible]], [[Tanakh|Hebrew Scriptures]], and other sacred works is presented by the UUA:\n{{quotation|While Unitarianism and Universalism both have roots in the Protestant Christian tradition, where the Bible is the sacred text, we now look to additional sources for religious and moral inspiration\u2026. We celebrate the spiritual insights of the world\u2019s religions, recognizing wisdom in many scriptures.\n\nWhen we read scripture in worship, whether it is the [[Bible]], the [[Dhammapada]], or the [[Tao Te-Ching]], we interpret it as a product of its time and its place,\u2026not to be interpreted narrowly or oppressively\u2026<nowiki>[</nowiki>S<nowiki>]</nowiki>cripture is never the only word, or the final word.\n\nFrom the beginning we have trusted in the human capacity to use reason and draw conclusions about religion\u2026 [E]ach of us ultimately chooses what is sacred to us.<ref>{{cite web\n |title=Sacred texts in Unitarian Universalism\n |url=https://www.uua.org/beliefs/what-we-believe/sacred-texts\n |access-date=2017-12-05\n}}</ref>}}\n\nIn short, Unitarian Universalists regard the texts of the world's religions as works of people, worthy of respect, with the intention that people from all religions or spiritual backgrounds live peaceably with one another.\n\n==Worship and practice==\n{{more citations needed section|date=June 2011}}\n\n===Diversity of practices===\nThe Unitarian belief that reason, and not creed, defines the search for truth, and the Universalist belief that God embraces all people equally has led to the current Unitarian Universalist belief that truth and spiritual meaning can be found in all faiths. This is reflected in the wide array of spiritual practices found among Unitarian Universalists today. Many Unitarian Universalist congregations include Buddhist-style meditation groups, Jewish [[Passover Seder|Seder]], [[Yom Kippur]] and Passover dinners, ''[[iftaar]]'' meals (marking the breaking of Ramadan fast for Muslims), and Christmas Eve/[[Winter Solstice#Observances|Winter Solstice]] services. Children's and youth's religious education classes teach about the divinity of the world and the sanctity of world religions. One of its more popular curricula, Neighboring Faiths (formerly Church Across the Street), takes middle and high school participants to visit the places of worship of many faith traditions including a [[Hindu]] temple, a [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] or [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] synagogue, and a [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] church.\n\nThere is great variety among Unitarian Universalist congregations, with some favoring particular religious beliefs or forms of worship over others, with many more home to an eclectic mix of beliefs. Regardless of their orientation, most congregations are fairly open to differing beliefs, though not always with various faith traditions represented to the same degree.\n\n===Diversity of congregations===\nThere is a wide variety in how congregations conceive of themselves, calling themselves \"churches\", \"societies\", \"fellowships\", \"congregations\", or eschew the use of any particular descriptor (e.g. \"[http://www.uusanmateo.org Unitarian Universalists of San Mateo]\"). Many use the name \"Unitarian Universalist\", (and a few \"Universalist Unitarian\"), having gradually adopted this formulation since consolidation in 1961. Others use names that reflect their historic roots by keeping the historical designation \"Unitarian\" or \"Universalist\" (e.g. \"[[First Unitarian Church (Milwaukee, Wisconsin)|First Unitarian Church]]\"). A few congregations use neither (e.g. [[Unity Temple]]). For some congregations, the name can be a clue to their theological orientation. For others, avoidance of the word \"church\" indicates a desire to distance itself from traditional Christian theology. Sometimes the use of another term may simply indicate a congregation's lay-led or relatively new status. However, some Unitarian Universalist congregations have grown to appreciate alternative terms such as ''fellowship'' and retained them even though they have grown much larger or lost features sometimes associated with their use (such as, in the case of fellowships, a traditionally lay-led worship model).<ref>See for examples: [http://www.uufellowship.org Unitarian Universalist Fellowship of Northern Westchester] and [http://www.uuathensga.org/ Unitarian Universalist Fellowship of Athens].</ref>\n\nAlso of note is that there are many more people who identify as Unitarian Universalist on surveys than those who attend Unitarian Universalist congregations (by a factor of four in a recent survey),<ref>[http://www.adherents.com/rel_USA.html Largest Religious Groups in the United States of America] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180820080454/http://www.adherents.com/rel_USA.html |date=2018-08-20 }}, Adherents.com</ref> reflecting those who have never joined (and lapsed members) but nonetheless consider themselves part of the Unitarian Universalist movement.\n\n===Elevator speeches===\nIn 2004, ''UU World'' magazine asked for contributions of \"[[elevator pitch|elevator speeches]]\" explaining Unitarian Universalism.<ref>''UU World Magazine''.

Therefore, one's own truth is unprovable, as is that of others. Consequently, we should respect the beliefs of others, as well as their right to hold those beliefs. Conversely, we expect that others should respect our right to our own beliefs. Several UU's then, would likely hold as many different beliefs. Other beliefs they may hold in common are a respect for others, for nature, and for common decency, leading to a particular caring for the poor, the weak and the downtrodden. As a result, issues of justice, including social justice are held in common among most. | Gene Douglas, Harrah, OK<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uuduluth.org/newsletters/nov06news.html |title=Dear Ones |accessdate=2007-02-24 |author=Karen Johnson Gustafson |date=November 2006 |work=Unitarian Universalist Congregation of Duluth Newsletter |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929140837/http://www.uuduluth.org/newsletters/nov06news.html |archivedate=September 29, 2007 }}</ref>}}\n\n{{quote | It's a blessing each of us was born; It matters what we do with our lives; What each of us knows about God is a piece of the truth; We don't have to do it alone.\n\n|Laila Ibrahim, Berkeley, CA<ref name=\"affirmations\"/>}}\n\n==Worship and ritual==\nAs in theology, Unitarian Universalist [[worship]] and [[ritual]] are often a combination of elements derived from other faith traditions alongside original practices and symbols. In form, church services might be difficult to distinguish from those of a [[Protestantism|Protestant]] church, but they vary widely among congregations.<ref name=\"Sias\"/>\n\n===Symbols===\nThe most common symbol of Unitarian Universalism is the [[flaming chalice]], often framed by two overlapping rings that many interpret as representing Unitarianism and Universalism (the symbol has no official interpretation). The chalice itself has long been a symbol of liberal religion, and indeed liberal Christianity (the [[Christian Church (Disciples of Christ)|Disciples of Christ]] also use a chalice as their denomination symbol<ref>{{cite web\n |url=http://www.disciples.org/AboutTheDisciples/TheChalice/tabid/70/Default.aspx \n |title=The Chalice \n |accessdate=2012-01-21 \n |publisher=[[Christian Church (Disciples of Christ)]] \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112154823/http://www.disciples.org/AboutTheDisciples/TheChalice/tabid/70/Default.aspx \n |archivedate=January 12, 2012 \n}}</ref>). The flaming chalice was initially the logo of the Unitarian Service Committee during the [[World War II|Second World War]]. It was created by Austrian artist [[Hans Deutsch]]. The holy oil burning in it is a symbol of helpfulness and sacrifice.\"<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.uua.org/aboutuu/chalice.html\n| title = The History of the Flaming Chalice\n| accessdate = 2007-02-24\n| author = Adapted from the pamphlet \"The Flaming Chalice\" by Daniel D. Hotchkiss\n| publisher = [[Unitarian Universalist Association]]}}</ref>\n\nNevertheless, other interpretations have been suggested, such as the chalice used by the followers of Czech [[Jan Hus]], which was supposedly reverential of Eastern Orthodox traditions; although Hus's early National Church was intrinsically an evangelical Protestant. In some agnostic historiographies the flaming chalice displayed a vague resemblance to a cross in some stylized representations, relying on the sepulchral traditions of the Hospitallers.<ref>{{cite web|first=Mark W.|last=Harris|title=The A to Z of Unitarian Universalism| publisher=Scarecrow Press|location=London}}</ref>   Many Unitarian Universalist congregations light a chalice at the beginning of worship services. Other symbols include an [[Christian cross variants#Modern innovations|off-center cross within a circle]] (a Universalist symbol associated with the Humiliati movement in the 1950s, a group of reformist, liturgically minded clergy seeking to revive Universalism).\n\nOther symbols include a pair of open hands releasing a [[dove]].<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://archive.uua.org/CONG/chalices/\n| title = UU Chalices and Clip Art\n| accessdate = 2008-04-12\n| author = Steve Bridenbaugh\n| publisher = [[Unitarian Universalist Association]]}}</ref>\n\n===Services of worship===\n[[File:UM 1.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|The [[First Unitarian Society of Madison|Unitarian Meeting House]] designed by [[Frank Lloyd Wright]], [[Shorewood Hills, Wisconsin]].]]\nReligious services are usually held on Sundays and most closely resemble the form and format of Protestant worship in the Reformed tradition.<ref name=\"Sias\"/> Services at a vast majority of congregations follow a structure that focuses on a sermon or presentation by a minister, a lay leader of the congregation, or an invited speaker.<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.uua.org/worshipweb/commonworship/vogt.html\n| title = Common Worship: How and Why; The contribution of Von Ogden Vogt\n| accessdate = 2007-02-24\n| author = Commission on Common Worship\n| year = 1983\n| work = Leading Congregations in Worship: A Guide\n| publisher = [[Unitarian Universalist Association]] |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070217132901/http://www.uua.org/worshipweb/commonworship/vogt.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-02-17}}</ref> Sermons may cover a wide range of topics. Since Unitarian Universalists do not recognize a particular text or set of texts as primary or inherently superior, inspiration can be found in many different religious or cultural texts as well as the personal experiences of the minister.\n\nThe service also includes hymn-singing, accompanied by organ, piano, or other available instruments, and possibly led by a song leader or choir. The most recent worship songbook published by the denomination, ''Singing the Journey''<ref>{{cite book|isbn=1-55896-499-1|title=Singing the Journey|year=2005}}</ref> contains 75 songs and is a supplement to the older ''Singing the Living Tradition'' which contains readings as well.<ref>{{cite book|isbn=1-55896-260-3|title=Singing the Living Tradition|year=1993}}</ref> Hymns typically sung in Unitarian Universalist services come from a variety of sources\u2014traditional [[hymn tune]]s with new or adapted lyrics, spirituals, folk songs from various cultures, or original compositions by Unitarian Universalist musicians are just a few. Instrumental music is also a common feature of the typical worship service, including preludes, offertory music, postludes, or music for contemplation.\n\nPastoral elements of the service may include a time for sharing Joys and Sorrows/Concerns, where individuals in the congregation are invited to [[Ceremonial use of lights|light a candle]] or say a few words about important events in their personal lives. Many also include a time of [[meditation]] or [[prayer]], led by the minister or service leader, both spoken and silent. Responsive readings and stories for children are also typical. Many congregations also allow for a time at the end of the service, called \"talk back\", where members of the congregation can respond to the sermon with their own insights and questions, or even disagree with the viewpoint expressed by the minister or invited speaker.\n\nMany Unitarian Universalist congregations no longer observe the Christian symbols of [[baptism]], [[Eucharist|communion]], or [[confirmation]], at least in their traditional forms or under their traditional names. Congregations that continue these practices under their more traditional names are often [[federated congregation|federated church]]es or members of the Council of Christian Churches within the Unitarian Universalist Association (CCCUUA), or may have active chapters associated with the [[Unitarian Universalist Christian Fellowship]] or similar covenant groups.<ref>[http://www.liveoakuu.org/christian04.htm Christians 2004] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090108233643/http://www.liveoakuu.org/christian04.htm |date=January 8, 2009 }}</ref> \"Child dedications\" often replace more traditional infant baptisms (such \"dedications\" are sometimes practiced even in \"orthodox\" Christian communities that do not baptize infants for theological reasons).

The \n[[Rochester Women's Rights Convention of 1848|second women's rights convention]] was held at the [[First Unitarian Church of Rochester|First Unitarian Church of Rochester, New York]].

Anthony]], a Unitarian and [[Quaker]], was extremely influential in the women's [[suffrage]] movement. Unitarian Universalists and Quakers still share many principles. It is therefore common to see Unitarian Universalists and Quakers working together.\n\nUnitarian Universalists were and are still very involved in the fight to end [[racism]] in the United States. [[John Haynes Holmes]], a Unitarian minister and social activist at The Community Church of New York\u2014Unitarian Universalist were among the founders of both the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP) in 1909 and the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU), chairing the latter for a time. [[James J. Reeb]], a minister at [[All Souls Church, Unitarian (Washington, D.C.)|All Souls Church, Unitarian]], in [[Washington, D.C.]] and a member of the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]], was clubbed in [[Selma, Alabama]] on March 8, 1965, and died two days later of massive head trauma. Two weeks after his death, [[Viola Liuzzo]], a Unitarian Universalist civil rights activist, was murdered by white supremacists after her participation in the protest march from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama. The [[Selma to Montgomery marches]] for voting rights are best known for [[Bloody Sunday (1965)|Bloody Sunday]], which refers to March 7, 1965, the most violent of the three marches.\n\nThe past head of the Unitarian Universalist Association 2001\u20132009, [[William G.

Politically conservative Unitarian Universalists point out that neither religious liberalism nor the Principles and Purposes of the UUA require liberal politics. Like the beliefs of Unitarian Universalists, politics are decided by individuals, not by congregations or the denomination.\n\nSeveral congregations have undertaken a series of organizational, procedural and practical steps to become acknowledged as a \"[[Unitarian Universalism and LGBT topics#Welcoming Congregation|Welcoming Congregation]]\": a congregation which has taken specific steps to welcome and integrate gay, lesbian, bisexual & transgender (LGBT) members. Unitarian Universalist ministers perform [[same-sex unions]] and now [[same-sex marriages]] where legal (and sometimes when not, as a form of civil protest). On June 29, 1984, the Unitarian Universalists became the first major church \"to approve religious blessings on homosexual unions.\"<ref>[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D05E0DB1539F93AA15755C0A962948260 \"Unitarians Endorse Homosexual Marriages\"], UPI, ''The New York Times'', 29 June 1984.</ref> Unitarian Universalists have been in the forefront of the work to make same-sex marriages legal in their local states and provinces, as well as on the national level. Gay men, bisexuals, and lesbians are also regularly [[ordained]] as ministers, and a number of gay, bisexual, and lesbian ministers have, themselves, now become legally married to their partners. In May 2004, [[Arlington Street Church (Boston)|Arlington Street Church]], in Boston, Massachusetts, was the site of the first state-sanctioned same-sex marriage in the United States. The official stance of the UUA is for the legalization of same-sex marriage\u2014\"Standing on the Side of Love\". In 2004 UU minister Debra Haffner of [[The Religious Institute on Sexual Morality, Justice, and Healing]] published ''An Open Letter on Religious Leaders on Marriage Equality'' to affirm same-sex marriage from a multi-faith perspective. In December 2009, Washington, D.C. Mayor [[Adrian Fenty]] signed the bill to legalize same-sex marriage for the [[District of Columbia]] in [[All Souls Church, Unitarian (Washington, D.C.)]]\n\n[[Unitarian Universalists for Polyamory Awareness]] engages Unitarian Universalist ministers and other leaders to educate them on [[polyamory]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uupa.org|title=UUPA website }}</ref> At the 2015 [[General Assembly (Unitarian Universalist Association)|UUA General Assembly]], the Association's non-discrimination rule was amended to include the category of \"family and relationship structures\";<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uua.org/uuagovernance/bylaws/ruleii/section-c-23-non-discrimination |title=Unitarian Universalist Association: Rule II, Section C-2.3.: Non-discrimination |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518103753/http://www.uua.org/uuagovernance/bylaws/ruleii/section-c-23-non-discrimination |archivedate=2015-05-18}}</ref> the UUA has yet to take specific follow-up action on this, however.\n\nMany congregations are heavily involved in projects and efforts aimed at supporting environmental causes and [[sustainability]].

The [[American Unitarian Conference]] and the [[Christian Universalist Association]] are the two most significant organizations representing these theological beliefs today. Christians who hold these beliefs tend to consider themselves the true Unitarians or Universalists and heirs of the theological legacy of the original [[American Unitarian Association]] or [[Universalist Church of America]], and they do not wish to be confused with Unitarian Universalists. The [[Unity Church]] is another denomination that is often confused with Unitarian Universalism.<ref>See [http://www.americanunitarian.org/voicearticle.htm \"Why the American Unitarian Conference Had to Be Formed\"] and [http://www.christianuniversalist.org/articles/unitarian.html \"What Is the Difference between Christian Universalism and Unitarian Universalism?\"]</ref>\n\n===Internal===\n\n====Language of reverence====\nDuring the presidency of William Sinkford, debate within the Unitarian Universalist movement roiled over his call to return to or create an authentic Unitarian Universalist \"language of reverence.\" Sinkford suggested that Unitarian Universalists abandoned traditional religious language, thereby abandoning words with potential power to others who will then dictate their meanings in the public sphere. He suggested that Unitarian Universalists regain their proper seat at the interfaith table by making this language their own. Others reacted to this call by believing it to be part of an effort to return Unitarian Universalist congregations to more orthodox Christian worship patterns. Sinkford denied this, citing the words of Unitarian Universalist humanists as examples of what he means by the \"language of reverence.\" The growth of humanism in Unitarianism was determined by a desire to raise the profile to a universal audience, educating atheists and agnostics in biblical literacy among the wider congregation of Unitarian Universalists, many of whom were born into families that lacked the rigour of a moral catechism.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.uuworld.org/articles/need-language-reverence|title=Human reverence: The language of reverence is the language of humanity|date=2006-07-31|first=Kendyl L.R.|last=Gibbons|publisher=UU World: Liberal religion and life|accessdate=2017-12-26}}</ref>\nThe debate included the publication of a book by the UUA's [[Beacon Press]] written by former UUA President John Buehrens.<ref>{{cite web|last=Buehrens |first=John A. |url=http://www.beliefnet.com/story/132/story_13272_1.html |title=Past Unitarian Universalist Association President John A.

It provides interpretative strategies, so that Unitarian Universalists (among others) might be able to engage in public debate about what the Bible says from a liberal religious perspective, rather than relinquishing to religious conservatives, and other more literal interpretations, all control over the book's contents and significance in matters of public and civic import.

The term may refer to any belief about the nature of [[Jesus]] [[Christ]] that affirms [[God]] as a singular entity and rejects the doctrine of the [[Trinity]], as affirmed by the [[Nicene Creed|mainstream Christianity]]: a consensus of Christian bishops at the [[First Council of Nicaea]] in 325. Nontrinitarianism was especially prevalent during the theological turmoils of the [[Protestant Reformation]]. A Spanish physician, [[Michael Servetus]], studied the Bible and concluded that the concept of the Trinity, as traditionally conceived, was not biblical. His books ''On the Errors of the Trinity'' and ''Christianismi Restitutio'' caused much uproar. Servetus was eventually arrested, convicted of heresy, and burned at the stake in [[Geneva]] in 1553.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.miguelservet.org/servetus/biography.htm |title=Michael Servetus Institute; Times that Servetus lived |publisher=Miguelservet.org |accessdate=2011-02-27}}</ref>\n\nThe term \"Unitarian\" entered the English language via [[Henry Hedworth]], who applied it to the teachings of [[Laelio Sozzini]] and the Polish [[Socinians]]. Unitarian churches were formally established in [[Transylvania]] and [[Poland]] (by the [[Socinianism|Socinians]]) in the second half of the 16th century.<ref name=\"Harris\">Harris, MW. Unitarian Universalist Origins: Our Historic Faith</ref> There, the first doctrines of religious freedom in Europe were established (in the course of several diets between 1557 and 1568, see [[Edict of Torda]]) under the jurisdiction of [[John Sigismund Z\u00e1polya|John Sigismund]], king of Hungary and Prince of Transylvania, the only Unitarian monarch. The early Unitarian church not only rejected the Trinity, but also the [[pre-existence of Christ]] as well as, in many cases, [[predestination]] and [[original sin]] as put forward by [[Augustine of Hippo]], and the [[substitutionary atonement]] of Christ developed by [[Anselm of Canterbury]] and John Calvin. There were several different forms of [[Christology]] in the beginnings of the Unitarian movement; ultimately, the dominant Christology became [[psilanthropism]]: that Jesus was a man, but one with a unique relationship to God.\n\n====Britain====\n{{main|History of Unitarianism}}\nInfluenced by the teachings of the Polish [[Socinians]], [[Samuel Clarke]] (1675\u20131729) revised the ''[[Book of Common Prayer]]'', removing the Trinitarian [[Nicene Creed]] and references to [[divinity of Jesus|Jesus as God]].<ref name=Clarke>{{cite web|url=http://www.americanunitarian.org/fisherhistory.htm |title=Chris Fisher, ''A Brief History of Unitarian Christianity'', retrieved July 18, 2008 |publisher=Americanunitarian.org |accessdate=2011-02-27}}</ref> [[Theophilus Lindsey]] also revised the ''Book of Common Prayer'' to allow a more tolerant, free Unitarian interpretation. Neither cleric was charged under the [[Blasphemy Act 1697]] that made it an \"offense for any person, educated in or having made profession of the Christian religion, by writing, preaching, teaching or advised speaking, to deny the [[Holy Trinity]]\". The [[Act of Toleration 1689|Act of Toleration]] (1689) gave relief to [[English Dissenters]], but excluded Unitarians. The efforts of Clarke and Lindsey met with substantial criticism from the more conservative clergy and laity of the [[Church of England]].

We celebrate the spiritual insights of the world\u2019s religions, recognizing wisdom in many scriptures.\n\nWhen we read scripture in worship, whether it is the [[Bible]], the [[Dhammapada]], or the [[Tao Te-Ching]], we interpret it as a product of its time and its place,\u2026not to be interpreted narrowly or oppressively\u2026<nowiki>[</nowiki>S<nowiki>]</nowiki>cripture is never the only word, or the final word.\n\nFrom the beginning we have trusted in the human capacity to use reason and draw conclusions about religion\u2026 [E]ach of us ultimately chooses what is sacred to us.<ref>{{cite web\n |title=Sacred texts in Unitarian Universalism\n |url=https://www.uua.org/beliefs/what-we-believe/sacred-texts\n |access-date=2017-12-05\n}}</ref>}}\n\nIn short, Unitarian Universalists regard the texts of the world's religions as works of people, worthy of respect, with the intention that people from all religions or spiritual backgrounds live peaceably with one another.\n\n==Worship and practice==\n{{more citations needed section|date=June 2011}}\n\n===Diversity of practices===\nThe Unitarian belief that reason, and not creed, defines the search for truth, and the Universalist belief that God embraces all people equally has led to the current Unitarian Universalist belief that truth and spiritual meaning can be found in all faiths. This is reflected in the wide array of spiritual practices found among Unitarian Universalists today. Many Unitarian Universalist congregations include Buddhist-style meditation groups, Jewish [[Passover Seder|Seder]], [[Yom Kippur]] and Passover dinners, ''[[iftaar]]'' meals (marking the breaking of Ramadan fast for Muslims), and Christmas Eve/[[Winter Solstice#Observances|Winter Solstice]] services. Children's and youth's religious education classes teach about the divinity of the world and the sanctity of world religions. One of its more popular curricula, Neighboring Faiths (formerly Church Across the Street), takes middle and high school participants to visit the places of worship of many faith traditions including a [[Hindu]] temple, a [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] or [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] synagogue, and a [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] church.\n\nThere is great variety among Unitarian Universalist congregations, with some favoring particular religious beliefs or forms of worship over others, with many more home to an eclectic mix of beliefs. Regardless of their orientation, most congregations are fairly open to differing beliefs, though not always with various faith traditions represented to the same degree.\n\n===Diversity of congregations===\nThere is a wide variety in how congregations conceive of themselves, calling themselves \"churches\", \"societies\", \"fellowships\", \"congregations\", or eschew the use of any particular descriptor (e.g. \"[http://www.uusanmateo.org Unitarian Universalists of San Mateo]\"). Many use the name \"Unitarian Universalist\", (and a few \"Universalist Unitarian\"), having gradually adopted this formulation since consolidation in 1961. Others use names that reflect their historic roots by keeping the historical designation \"Unitarian\" or \"Universalist\" (e.g. \"[[First Unitarian Church (Milwaukee, Wisconsin)|First Unitarian Church]]\"). A few congregations use neither (e.g. [[Unity Temple]]). For some congregations, the name can be a clue to their theological orientation. For others, avoidance of the word \"church\" indicates a desire to distance itself from traditional Christian theology. Sometimes the use of another term may simply indicate a congregation's lay-led or relatively new status. However, some Unitarian Universalist congregations have grown to appreciate alternative terms such as ''fellowship'' and retained them even though they have grown much larger or lost features sometimes associated with their use (such as, in the case of fellowships, a traditionally lay-led worship model).<ref>See for examples: [http://www.uufellowship.org Unitarian Universalist Fellowship of Northern Westchester] and [http://www.uuathensga.org/ Unitarian Universalist Fellowship of Athens].</ref>\n\nAlso of note is that there are many more people who identify as Unitarian Universalist on surveys than those who attend Unitarian Universalist congregations (by a factor of four in a recent survey),<ref>[http://www.adherents.com/rel_USA.html Largest Religious Groups in the United States of America] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180820080454/http://www.adherents.com/rel_USA.html |date=2018-08-20 }}, Adherents.com</ref> reflecting those who have never joined (and lapsed members) but nonetheless consider themselves part of the Unitarian Universalist movement.\n\n===Elevator speeches===\nIn 2004, ''UU World'' magazine asked for contributions of \"[[elevator pitch|elevator speeches]]\" explaining Unitarian Universalism.<ref>''UU World Magazine''.

Therefore, one's own truth is unprovable, as is that of others. Consequently, we should respect the beliefs of others, as well as their right to hold those beliefs. Conversely, we expect that others should respect our right to our own beliefs. Several UU's then, would likely hold as many different beliefs. Other beliefs they may hold in common are a respect for others, for nature, and for common decency, leading to a particular caring for the poor, the weak and the downtrodden.

In form, church services might be difficult to distinguish from those of a [[Protestantism|Protestant]] church, but they vary widely among congregations.<ref name=\"Sias\"/>\n\n===Symbols===\nThe most common symbol of Unitarian Universalism is the [[flaming chalice]], often framed by two overlapping rings that many interpret as representing Unitarianism and Universalism (the symbol has no official interpretation). The chalice itself has long been a symbol of liberal religion, and indeed liberal Christianity (the [[Christian Church (Disciples of Christ)|Disciples of Christ]] also use a chalice as their denomination symbol<ref>{{cite web\n |url=http://www.disciples.org/AboutTheDisciples/TheChalice/tabid/70/Default.aspx \n |title=The Chalice \n |accessdate=2012-01-21 \n |publisher=[[Christian Church (Disciples of Christ)]] \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112154823/http://www.disciples.org/AboutTheDisciples/TheChalice/tabid/70/Default.aspx \n |archivedate=January 12, 2012 \n}}</ref>). The flaming chalice was initially the logo of the Unitarian Service Committee during the [[World War II|Second World War]]. It was created by Austrian artist [[Hans Deutsch]]. The holy oil burning in it is a symbol of helpfulness and sacrifice.\"<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.uua.org/aboutuu/chalice.html\n| title = The History of the Flaming Chalice\n| accessdate = 2007-02-24\n| author = Adapted from the pamphlet \"The Flaming Chalice\" by Daniel D. Hotchkiss\n| publisher = [[Unitarian Universalist Association]]}}</ref>\n\nNevertheless, other interpretations have been suggested, such as the chalice used by the followers of Czech [[Jan Hus]], which was supposedly reverential of Eastern Orthodox traditions; although Hus's early National Church was intrinsically an evangelical Protestant. In some agnostic historiographies the flaming chalice displayed a vague resemblance to a cross in some stylized representations, relying on the sepulchral traditions of the Hospitallers.<ref>{{cite web|first=Mark W.|last=Harris|title=The A to Z of Unitarian Universalism| publisher=Scarecrow Press|location=London}}</ref>   Many Unitarian Universalist congregations light a chalice at the beginning of worship services. Other symbols include an [[Christian cross variants#Modern innovations|off-center cross within a circle]] (a Universalist symbol associated with the Humiliati movement in the 1950s, a group of reformist, liturgically minded clergy seeking to revive Universalism).\n\nOther symbols include a pair of open hands releasing a [[dove]].<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://archive.uua.org/CONG/chalices/\n| title = UU Chalices and Clip Art\n| accessdate = 2008-04-12\n| author = Steve Bridenbaugh\n| publisher = [[Unitarian Universalist Association]]}}</ref>\n\n===Services of worship===\n[[File:UM 1.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|The [[First Unitarian Society of Madison|Unitarian Meeting House]] designed by [[Frank Lloyd Wright]], [[Shorewood Hills, Wisconsin]].]]\nReligious services are usually held on Sundays and most closely resemble the form and format of Protestant worship in the Reformed tradition.<ref name=\"Sias\"/> Services at a vast majority of congregations follow a structure that focuses on a sermon or presentation by a minister, a lay leader of the congregation, or an invited speaker.<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.uua.org/worshipweb/commonworship/vogt.html\n| title = Common Worship: How and Why; The contribution of Von Ogden Vogt\n| accessdate = 2007-02-24\n| author = Commission on Common Worship\n| year = 1983\n| work = Leading Congregations in Worship: A Guide\n| publisher = [[Unitarian Universalist Association]] |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070217132901/http://www.uua.org/worshipweb/commonworship/vogt.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-02-17}}</ref> Sermons may cover a wide range of topics. Since Unitarian Universalists do not recognize a particular text or set of texts as primary or inherently superior, inspiration can be found in many different religious or cultural texts as well as the personal experiences of the minister.\n\nThe service also includes hymn-singing, accompanied by organ, piano, or other available instruments, and possibly led by a song leader or choir. The most recent worship songbook published by the denomination, ''Singing the Journey''<ref>{{cite book|isbn=1-55896-499-1|title=Singing the Journey|year=2005}}</ref> contains 75 songs and is a supplement to the older ''Singing the Living Tradition'' which contains readings as well.<ref>{{cite book|isbn=1-55896-260-3|title=Singing the Living Tradition|year=1993}}</ref> Hymns typically sung in Unitarian Universalist services come from a variety of sources\u2014traditional [[hymn tune]]s with new or adapted lyrics, spirituals, folk songs from various cultures, or original compositions by Unitarian Universalist musicians are just a few. Instrumental music is also a common feature of the typical worship service, including preludes, offertory music, postludes, or music for contemplation.\n\nPastoral elements of the service may include a time for sharing Joys and Sorrows/Concerns, where individuals in the congregation are invited to [[Ceremonial use of lights|light a candle]] or say a few words about important events in their personal lives. Many also include a time of [[meditation]] or [[prayer]], led by the minister or service leader, both spoken and silent. Responsive readings and stories for children are also typical. Many congregations also allow for a time at the end of the service, called \"talk back\", where members of the congregation can respond to the sermon with their own insights and questions, or even disagree with the viewpoint expressed by the minister or invited speaker.\n\nMany Unitarian Universalist congregations no longer observe the Christian symbols of [[baptism]], [[Eucharist|communion]], or [[confirmation]], at least in their traditional forms or under their traditional names. Congregations that continue these practices under their more traditional names are often [[federated congregation|federated church]]es or members of the Council of Christian Churches within the Unitarian Universalist Association (CCCUUA), or may have active chapters associated with the [[Unitarian Universalist Christian Fellowship]] or similar covenant groups.<ref>[http://www.liveoakuu.org/christian04.htm Christians 2004] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090108233643/http://www.liveoakuu.org/christian04.htm |date=January 8, 2009 }}</ref> \"Child dedications\" often replace more traditional infant baptisms (such \"dedications\" are sometimes practiced even in \"orthodox\" Christian communities that do not baptize infants for theological reasons).

The \n[[Rochester Women's Rights Convention of 1848|second women's rights convention]] was held at the [[First Unitarian Church of Rochester|First Unitarian Church of Rochester, New York]].

Anthony]], a Unitarian and [[Quaker]], was extremely influential in the women's [[suffrage]] movement. Unitarian Universalists and Quakers still share many principles. It is therefore common to see Unitarian Universalists and Quakers working together.\n\nUnitarian Universalists were and are still very involved in the fight to end [[racism]] in the United States. [[John Haynes Holmes]], a Unitarian minister and social activist at The Community Church of New York\u2014Unitarian Universalist were among the founders of both the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP) in 1909 and the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU), chairing the latter for a time. [[James J. Reeb]], a minister at [[All Souls Church, Unitarian (Washington, D.C.)|All Souls Church, Unitarian]], in [[Washington, D.C.]] and a member of the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]], was clubbed in [[Selma, Alabama]] on March 8, 1965, and died two days later of massive head trauma. Two weeks after his death, [[Viola Liuzzo]], a Unitarian Universalist civil rights activist, was murdered by white supremacists after her participation in the protest march from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama. The [[Selma to Montgomery marches]] for voting rights are best known for [[Bloody Sunday (1965)|Bloody Sunday]], which refers to March 7, 1965, the most violent of the three marches.\n\nThe past head of the Unitarian Universalist Association 2001\u20132009, [[William G.

Politically conservative Unitarian Universalists point out that neither religious liberalism nor the Principles and Purposes of the UUA require liberal politics. Like the beliefs of Unitarian Universalists, politics are decided by individuals, not by congregations or the denomination.\n\nSeveral congregations have undertaken a series of organizational, procedural and practical steps to become acknowledged as a \"[[Unitarian Universalism and LGBT topics#Welcoming Congregation|Welcoming Congregation]]\": a congregation which has taken specific steps to welcome and integrate gay, lesbian, bisexual & transgender (LGBT) members. Unitarian Universalist ministers perform [[same-sex unions]] and now [[same-sex marriages]] where legal (and sometimes when not, as a form of civil protest). On June 29, 1984, the Unitarian Universalists became the first major church \"to approve religious blessings on homosexual unions.\"<ref>[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D05E0DB1539F93AA15755C0A962948260 \"Unitarians Endorse Homosexual Marriages\"], UPI, ''The New York Times'', 29 June 1984.</ref> Unitarian Universalists have been in the forefront of the work to make same-sex marriages legal in their local states and provinces, as well as on the national level. Gay men, bisexuals, and lesbians are also regularly [[ordained]] as ministers, and a number of gay, bisexual, and lesbian ministers have, themselves, now become legally married to their partners. In May 2004, [[Arlington Street Church (Boston)|Arlington Street Church]], in Boston, Massachusetts, was the site of the first state-sanctioned same-sex marriage in the United States. The official stance of the UUA is for the legalization of same-sex marriage\u2014\"Standing on the Side of Love\". In 2004 UU minister Debra Haffner of [[The Religious Institute on Sexual Morality, Justice, and Healing]] published ''An Open Letter on Religious Leaders on Marriage Equality'' to affirm same-sex marriage from a multi-faith perspective. In December 2009, Washington, D.C. Mayor [[Adrian Fenty]] signed the bill to legalize same-sex marriage for the [[District of Columbia]] in [[All Souls Church, Unitarian (Washington, D.C.)]]\n\n[[Unitarian Universalists for Polyamory Awareness]] engages Unitarian Universalist ministers and other leaders to educate them on [[polyamory]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uupa.org|title=UUPA website }}</ref> At the 2015 [[General Assembly (Unitarian Universalist Association)|UUA General Assembly]], the Association's non-discrimination rule was amended to include the category of \"family and relationship structures\";<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uua.org/uuagovernance/bylaws/ruleii/section-c-23-non-discrimination |title=Unitarian Universalist Association: Rule II, Section C-2.3.: Non-discrimination |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518103753/http://www.uua.org/uuagovernance/bylaws/ruleii/section-c-23-non-discrimination |archivedate=2015-05-18}}</ref> the UUA has yet to take specific follow-up action on this, however.\n\nMany congregations are heavily involved in projects and efforts aimed at supporting environmental causes and [[sustainability]].

The [[American Unitarian Conference]] and the [[Christian Universalist Association]] are the two most significant organizations representing these theological beliefs today. Christians who hold these beliefs tend to consider themselves the true Unitarians or Universalists and heirs of the theological legacy of the original [[American Unitarian Association]] or [[Universalist Church of America]], and they do not wish to be confused with Unitarian Universalists. The [[Unity Church]] is another denomination that is often confused with Unitarian Universalism.<ref>See [http://www.americanunitarian.org/voicearticle.htm \"Why the American Unitarian Conference Had to Be Formed\"] and [http://www.christianuniversalist.org/articles/unitarian.html \"What Is the Difference between Christian Universalism and Unitarian Universalism?\"]</ref>\n\n===Internal===\n\n====Language of reverence====\nDuring the presidency of William Sinkford, debate within the Unitarian Universalist movement roiled over his call to return to or create an authentic Unitarian Universalist \"language of reverence.\" Sinkford suggested that Unitarian Universalists abandoned traditional religious language, thereby abandoning words with potential power to others who will then dictate their meanings in the public sphere. He suggested that Unitarian Universalists regain their proper seat at the interfaith table by making this language their own. Others reacted to this call by believing it to be part of an effort to return Unitarian Universalist congregations to more orthodox Christian worship patterns. Sinkford denied this, citing the words of Unitarian Universalist humanists as examples of what he means by the \"language of reverence.\" The growth of humanism in Unitarianism was determined by a desire to raise the profile to a universal audience, educating atheists and agnostics in biblical literacy among the wider congregation of Unitarian Universalists, many of whom were born into families that lacked the rigour of a moral catechism.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.uuworld.org/articles/need-language-reverence|title=Human reverence: The language of reverence is the language of humanity|date=2006-07-31|first=Kendyl L.R.|last=Gibbons|publisher=UU World: Liberal religion and life|accessdate=2017-12-26}}</ref>\nThe debate included the publication of a book by the UUA's [[Beacon Press]] written by former UUA President John Buehrens.<ref>{{cite web|last=Buehrens |first=John A. |url=http://www.beliefnet.com/story/132/story_13272_1.html |title=Past Unitarian Universalist Association President John A.

It provides interpretative strategies, so that Unitarian Universalists (among others) might be able to engage in public debate about what the Bible says from a liberal religious perspective, rather than relinquishing to religious conservatives, and other more literal interpretations, all control over the book's contents and significance in matters of public and civic import.

It is operated as a wholly owned subsidiary of the [[Port Authority of New York and New Jersey]]. PATH trains run around the clock year round; four routes serving 13 stations operate during the daytime on weekdays, while two routes operate during weekends, late nights, and holidays. Its tracks cross the [[Hudson River]] through century-old [[cast iron]] tubes that rest on the river bottom under a thin layer of silt. It operates as a deep-level subway in Manhattan and the Jersey City/Hoboken riverfront; from Grove Street in Jersey City to Newark, trains run in [[Cut (earthmoving)|open cuts]], at grade level, and on [[Elevated railway|elevated track]].\n\nThe routes of the PATH system were originally operated by the '''Hudson & Manhattan Railroad (H&M)''', built to link New Jersey's [[Hudson Waterfront]] with New York City. The system began operations in 1908 and was fully built out in 1911. Three stations have since closed; two others were re-located after a re-alignment of the western terminus. From the 1920s, the rise of automobile travel and the concurrent construction of bridges and tunnels across the river sent the H&M into a financial decline from which it never recovered, and it was forced into [[Bankruptcy in the United States|bankruptcy]] in 1954. As part of the deal that cleared the way for the construction of the [[World Trade Center (1973-2001)|original World Trade Center]], the Port Authority bought the H&M out of receivership in 1962 and renamed it PATH. In the 2000s and 2010s the system suffered considerably from disasters that affected the region, most notably the [[September 11 attacks]] and [[Hurricane Sandy]]. Both private and public stakeholders have proposed expanding PATH service in New Jersey, and construction on an extension to [[Newark Liberty International Airport]] is projected to start in 2020.\n\nAlthough PATH has long operated as a rapid transit system, it is legally a [[commuter rail]]road under the jurisdiction of the [[Federal Railroad Administration]] (FRA); its trackage between Newark and Jersey City is located in close proximity to [[Northeast Corridor]] trackage and shares the [[Dock Bridge|Newark Dock Bridge]] with intercity and commuter trains. All PATH train operators must therefore be licensed railroad engineers and extra inspections are required. PATH currently uses one class of rolling stock, the PA5, which was delivered in 2009\u20132011.\n\n==History==\n\n==={{Anchor|Early history}}Hudson & Manhattan Railroad===\nThe PATH system predates the [[New York City Subway]]'s [[Early history of the IRT subway|first underground line]], operated by the [[Interborough Rapid Transit Company]]. The Hudson & Manhattan Railroad (H&M) was planned in 1874, but it was not possible at that time to safely tunnel under the [[Hudson River]]. Construction began on the existing tunnels in 1890, but soon stopped when funding ran out. It resumed in 1900 under the direction of [[William Gibbs McAdoo]], an ambitious young lawyer who had moved to New York from [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]], and later became president of the H&M.<ref name=\"Fitzherbert\">{{cite web|last=Fitzherbert, Anthony|url=http://world.nycsubway.org/us/path/hmhistory.html|title=\"The Public Be Pleased\": William G.

Every PATH station except [[Pennsylvania Station (Newark)|Newark]] and [[Harrison (PATH station)|Harrison]] is served by a train every two to three minutes, for a peak-hour service of 20\u201330 trains per hour.<ref name=\"PATH-Timetable\" />\n\n{{as of|2018|alt=In 2018}}, PATH saw 81.7 million passengers. {{as of|June 2019}}, the system is used by over 283,000 passengers per weekday; almost 105,000 per Saturday; 75,000 per Sunday; and 94,000 per holiday. The busiest station is World Trade Center, whose 46,000 average passengers per day is over 10 times the daily traffic of Christopher Street, the least busy station.

Additionally, all PATH train operators must be federally certified [[Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers|locomotive engineers]], and the agency must conduct more detailed safety inspections than other rapid transit systems.

It is operated as a wholly owned subsidiary of the [[Port Authority of New York and New Jersey]]. PATH trains run around the clock year round; four routes serving 13 stations operate during the daytime on weekdays, while two routes operate during weekends, late nights, and holidays. Its tracks cross the [[Hudson River]] through century-old [[cast iron]] tubes that rest on the river bottom under a thin layer of silt. It operates as a deep-level subway in Manhattan and the Jersey City/Hoboken riverfront; from Grove Street in Jersey City to Newark, trains run in [[Cut (earthmoving)|open cuts]], at grade level, and on [[Elevated railway|elevated track]].\n\nThe routes of the PATH system were originally operated by the '''Hudson & Manhattan Railroad (H&M)''', built to link New Jersey's [[Hudson Waterfront]] with New York City. The system began operations in 1908 and was fully built out in 1911. Three stations have since closed; two others were re-located after a re-alignment of the western terminus. From the 1920s, the rise of automobile travel and the concurrent construction of bridges and tunnels across the river sent the H&M into a financial decline from which it never recovered, and it was forced into [[Bankruptcy in the United States|bankruptcy]] in 1954. As part of the deal that cleared the way for the construction of the [[World Trade Center (1973-2001)|original World Trade Center]], the Port Authority bought the H&M out of receivership in 1962 and renamed it PATH. In the 2000s and 2010s the system suffered considerably from disasters that affected the region, most notably the [[September 11 attacks]] and [[Hurricane Sandy]]. Both private and public stakeholders have proposed expanding PATH service in New Jersey, and construction on an extension to [[Newark Liberty International Airport]] is projected to start in 2020.\n\nAlthough PATH has long operated as a rapid transit system, it is legally a [[commuter rail]]road under the jurisdiction of the [[Federal Railroad Administration]] (FRA); its trackage between Newark and Jersey City is located in close proximity to [[Northeast Corridor]] trackage and shares the [[Dock Bridge|Newark Dock Bridge]] with intercity and commuter trains. All PATH train operators must therefore be licensed railroad engineers and extra inspections are required. PATH currently uses one class of rolling stock, the PA5, which was delivered in 2009\u20132011.\n\n==History==\n\n==={{Anchor|Early history}}Hudson & Manhattan Railroad===\nThe PATH system predates the [[New York City Subway]]'s [[Early history of the IRT subway|first underground line]], operated by the [[Interborough Rapid Transit Company]]. The Hudson & Manhattan Railroad (H&M) was planned in 1874, but it was not possible at that time to safely tunnel under the [[Hudson River]]. Construction began on the existing tunnels in 1890, but soon stopped when funding ran out. It resumed in 1900 under the direction of [[William Gibbs McAdoo]], an ambitious young lawyer who had moved to New York from [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]], and later became president of the H&M.<ref name=\"Fitzherbert\">{{cite web|last=Fitzherbert, Anthony|url=http://world.nycsubway.org/us/path/hmhistory.html|title=\"The Public Be Pleased\": William G.

Additionally, all PATH train operators must be federally certified [[Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers|locomotive engineers]], and the agency must conduct more detailed safety inspections than other rapid transit systems.

A radio performer since 1932, he presented a popular housewives' program, as well as \"Chatterbox Corner\" with his wife Nancy Lee (Kathleen Lindgren).\n\nIn an era when Australian radio announcers routinely adopted false British accents{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} and a \"hard sell\" approach to advertisements, Whitta's authentic Australian voice and irreverent attitude towards his sponsors made him the idol of his audience. By the early 1950s a newspaper survey found that more than 70 per cent of Melbourne housewives tuned into his show.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}\n\nIn his foreword to Nancy Lee's book ''Being a Chum Was Fun'' (1979) Kennedy wrote:\n\n<blockquote>\nAbout 40 years ago, when I was a snow haired six year old, I can remember being totally captivated by a grown man pretending to be a naughty little boy on [[3AW]]'s children session called \"Chatterbox Corner\". His name was Clifford Whitta, and he was to become the most important man in my life. Years later I was even more fascinated with this man when he conducted a breakfast program and let the boy who played his records '''actually talk on the air with him'''.<ref>{{cite book\n | first = Nancy\n | last = Lee\n | year = 1979\n | title = Being a Chum was Fun: the Story of Nancy Lee\n | publisher = Listen & Learn Productions\n | location = Melbourne\n | isbn = 0-9596136-1-7}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nNicholls moved from [[3KZ]] to [[3UZ]] (where Kennedy was working), bringing with him his teenage panel operators Alf \"Alfie Boy\" Thesinger and Russell Archer. However, eighteen-year-olds, Thesinger and Archer were \"called up\" (conscripted) for National Service. Nancy Lee's book records:\n\n<blockquote>\nI asked Nicky, \"Have you decided on anyone to help you in the session yet?\" When I heard the chosen one was to be young Graham, I was surprised. \"Oh, no, not Graham! [...] he's a nice boy, but he can't talk.\" Nick said, \"Mum, leave him to me.\"<ref>Lee, Nancy (1979), p. 149.</ref></blockquote>\n\nNicky became father-figure, personal friend and mentor to Kennedy, and the two built an extraordinary on-air rapport. Kennedy wrote:\n<blockquote>\nBeing straight man to one of the greatest entertainers of our time was not all that easy. We were not always chums. He would spend weeks not talking to me (except on air) for something I had unknowingly said or done. Once he even suspended me from the programme for some trivial matter. [...] I worked with him until his sudden death in 1956. I never stopped being a fan. I did not realise then that I had been prepared for another career on another electrical medium: the most potent communication device of the century.''<ref>Lee, Nancy (1979), foreword by GK. Elided text: \"'But it was more than worthwhile putting up with his various moods and it must be remembered that he in turn was putting up with a very gauche seventeen year old. And of course, he taught me so much: how to use radio not just be on it. He took me under his wing and became a surrogate father. I spend many happy times with him and his family at his house in Ivanhoe. They were very special occasions for me. I baby sat for him and Kathy a few times.'\n</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nNicky died on 8 September 1956.\n\n===Other radio===\nBy May 1957, Kennedy was appearing on television, but also presented a [[3AK]] morning radio program with [[Bert Newton]] in 1961\u20131962, which later originated from a studio built at Kennedy's home in [[Olivers Hill]], [[Frankston, Victoria|Frankston]].\n\nIn 1970 he worked at [[3XY]]; from June to December 1975 he appeared on a [[3LO]] drivetime program with Richard Combe; from September to November 1976 was on [[3TTT|3DB]] with Denis Scanlan; in 1977 he returned to DB to cover the [[Silver Jubilee of Elizabeth II]] live from London.\n\n===RS Playhouse===\nKennedy recorded eight thirty-minute radio comedies for the ABC under the title ''[[Graham Kennedy's RS Playhouse]]''. Written by [[Gary Reilly]] and [[Tony Sattler]] (who together wrote the television programs ''[[Kingswood Country]]'' and ''[[The Naked Vicar Show]]''), the shows were broadcast between 11 August and 23 September 1979.\n\nThe episode titles were:\n\n*\"The Birthday Boy\"\n*\"Because He's My Brother\"\n*\"You Only Live Once\"\n*\"Sunday Morning Fever\"\n*\"The Chocolate Milkman\"\n*\"The Prawnbroker\"\n*\"Mad Jack's Dentist\"\n*\"The Good Morning Show\"\n\nSattler and his wife (actress [[Noeline Brown]]) were two of Kennedy's closest friends.\n\n===2Day FM===\nIn 1980 Kennedy became a ten percent shareholder in Sydney radio station [[2Day FM]] and from 24 May 1981 presented a computer-edited, three-hour Sunday morning program of music and comedy.<ref>Blundell (2003), pp. 350\u2013351</ref>\n\n==Television career==\n\nKennedy's first television appearance was in March 1957, representing 3UZ on a [[GTV-9]] [[Red Cross]] [[telethon]]. Viewing his performance on the monitors, GTV-9's general manager [[Colin Bednall]] and producer Norman Spencer ''\"... turned to one another without exchanging a word and shook hands.\"''<ref>{{cite book\n | first = Gerald\n | last = Stone\n | authorlink = Gerald Stone\n | year = 2000\n | title = Compulsive Viewing: The inside story that rocked the TV industry\n | publisher = Penguin Books\n | location = Victoria\n | isbn = 0-14-029817-7}}\n\"'When a full face of Kennedy alone came on the monitor, Spencer and I turned to one another without exchanging a word and shook hands. At the time, we were in desperate need of talent. At a glance, you could see that this boy on camera, with his cheap haircut and popping eyes, had gone to endless pains rehearsing his act and also had outstanding ability. When we talked to Kennedy he made no attempt at playing hard to get. He was busting to get into television.'\"\n</ref>\n\n===''In Melbourne Tonight''===\n{{main|In Melbourne Tonight}}\n\n{{Dialogue\n|Bert Newton|Hello, I'm Bert Newton.\n|Graham Kennedy|Big deal.}}\n\nBednall and Spencer defied both the GTV-9 boardroom and the first sponsor (Philips) by choosing Kennedy, who began on a salary of [[Australian pound|\u00a3]]30 for five one-hour evening shows per week to be called ''[[In Melbourne Tonight]]'' (or ''IMT'') which began on 6 May 1957. Thus the 23-year-old Kennedy began a career of which he later said that he was ''\"terrified for forty years\"''.<ref>Stone (2000), p.93\n\"'I was terrified for forty years is what I can tell you about my career', he says now, confirming the stories told of him having to steel his nerves before almost every performance. 'Well, out of the thousands of television shows and radio shows, once or twice I was quite comfortable, but mostly I was frightened.'\"</ref> The show's theme song, \"[[Gee, But You're Swell]]\", was written by [[Abel Baer]] and Thomas Tobias in 1936.\n\nKennedy was not GTV-9's first choice \u2013 they had planned to use either 3UZ personality John McMahon or 3DB's Dick Cranbourne. Despite later reports that the program's name had been intended to be ''[[The Late Show (1950s Australian TV series)|The Late Show]]'', and that rival station [[HSV-7]] beat GTV-9 to the title by one week, contemporary press reports from several weeks before the show's debut list the title as \"In Melbourne Tonight\".<ref>https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=GTBVAAAAIBAJ&sjid=H5UDAAAAIBAJ&pg=5407%2C1560074</ref> The program became extremely popular, although Kennedy had his detractors. Kennedy was quoted as saying:\n<blockquote>\nMany women write to tell me that although their husbands may not like me, they do. It appears from the mail that the women have the say on what the household is watching. And we do remember that it is the women who do the buying of products that we advertise. Bearing that in mind we try and design our commercials for them.<ref>Blundell (2003), p. 216</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n''IMT'' was devised as a copy of the American 'Tonight Show' format, with the host presiding over sketches, introducing star artists and reading advertisements live. His colleague [[Bert Newton]] records in his autobiography:<ref>{{cite book\n | first = Bert\n | last = Newton\n | authorlink = Bert Newton\n | year = 1977\n | title = Bert! Bert Newton's Own Story\n | publisher = Garry Sparkes & Associates\n | location = Toorak, Victoria\n | isbn = 0-908081-24-3\n | pages = 91\u201393\n}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>\n(Norman) Spencer was the mastermind of ''IMT''; don't let anyone forget that. Nothing happened on ''IMT'' that Norm did not approve personally [...] Norman Spencer chose Graham Kennedy as comp\u00e8re; Norm kept his eye on the show from day to day; he pushed the buttons from the control room which put the TV shots into viewers' homes at night; he added the talent around Graham and he set up the organisation.\n</blockquote>\n\nSpencer wielded other influence too. According to Hugh Stuckey, a writer on the show, the producer placed Kennedy with a series of attractive young women to displace rumours of Kennedy's homosexuality.\n<blockquote>\nThis was an era in which homosexuality was, well, horrifying. So every now and again Kennedy had to be seen about in case any viewers thought him the other persuasion. [...] It was cleverly manipulated \u2013 the station had the media at its disposal. It was all to give Graham a good old hetero image though he always seemed very unsexual.<ref>Blundell (2003), p. 161</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nBy July 1959 the program was still popular in Melbourne. Recurring comedy players [[Joff Ellen]] and Rosie Sturgess became regulars. Singer [[Toni Lamond]] joined the cast. Attempts were made at this time to launch Kennedy as a ''national'' personality. Special Friday night editions of IMT were produced under the title of ''The Graham Kennedy Show'' and recorded on videotape which had just come into use. After being transmitted live in Melbourne taped copies of the show would be shipped to Adelaide, Brisbane and Sydney for transmission there on subsequent evenings.<ref>Blundell (2003), p. 185-6</ref> Producer Spencer observed there was critical and popular resistance to Kennedy in Sydney. Queensland too had shown suspicion to imports from down south trumpeted to Queenslanders as the best in Australia while Queensland itself had apparently been left out of this judgement.<ref>Blundell (2003), p. 186-7</ref>\n\n''The Graham Kennedy Show'' began in February 1960 but was not popular in Sydney. The program was judged stilted compared to IMT itself; Kennedy seemed much more subdued than usual, was tense, and the comedy was not working. Critics in Sydney and Queensland disliked key components of the show.<ref>Blundell (2003), p. 188-90</ref> Judged as a flop, ''The Graham Kennedy Show'' in Sydney was dropped by ATN7 after 13 weeks. The program however was immediately picked up by TCN9 \u2013 its general manager [[Ken G. Hall]] saw potential in the program. After continued bad reviews its popularity increased in Sydney. By July 1960 it had reached its twenty-fifth episode and had the highest ratings in Australia.<ref>Blundell (2003), p. 1892-3</ref>\n\nLater in 1960 Kennedy faced opposition when [[Sir Frank Packer]] bought GTV-9. Unlike the previous owner, Packer interfered directly with the station's activities. GTV-9 executive Colin Bednall reported that Packer hated Kennedy and forcefully articulated his desire to have him removed from the IMT.\n\n<blockquote>\nPacker had a [[homophobia|phobia about homosexuals]] and he believed Kennedy to be one. He insisted he could pick one a mile off.<ref>Stone (2000), quoting from \"an unpublished memoir now lodged with the National Library in Canberra\" by Colin Bednall. Also quoted in Blundell (2003), p. 196</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nKennedy himself was aware that Packer \"loathed\" him:\n\n<blockquote>\nSir Frank did suspect that I and others were of that persuasion. I mean if everyone in the television industry was fired because of that, there would be few around! [...] I've been accused of everything. I've been accused of being homosexual, bisexual, heterosexual and worst of all asexual, which means you don't do anything. That's cruel.<ref>Stone (2000), p. 83; quoted in Blundell (2003), p. 196-7</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nPacker's arrival prompted the departure of IMT producer Norman Spencer. IMT continued its run. Other regular performers on IMT were [[Patti Newton]] and [[Philip Brady (broadcaster)|Philip Brady]]. In 1961 Kennedy described his presentation of the program.\n\n<blockquote>\nIn the whole of the ten years I have been working on radio and television, I have been working to a majority of women. I think women prefer men to be well-mannered, so I always try to watch my manners. They like men to be well dressed, so I do my best to observe this. Others bring to my notice the fact that I sometimes make grammatical errors in my speech; so, because of this, I try to watch my grammar \u2013 but at the same time I bear in mind that it's more profitable for me to be entertaining than to be perfect in my use of English.<ref>Blundell (2003), p. 215.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nBy March 1961 the national show had been renamed ''Graham Kennedy's Channel 9 Show'' and was finding quiet acceptance nationally. Even at this time Kennedy admitted there were problems in the weekly national show.\n\n<blockquote>\nWe clam up and get tense. But I think the national show will improve in the next few weeks. We want to include the best segments of ''IMT'' in the national show. ''IMT'' is a lot more spontaneous than the national show \u2013 we've run up to an hour overtime. We like to get the audience to participate and if we can find someone interesting in the studio audience we throw away our scripts and just adlib.<ref>Blundell (2003), p. 218.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nKennedy by this stage did not always host ''IMT''. Bert Newton hosted on Monday nights. Then a September 1961 reshuffle had Toni Lamond host Monday nights and Newton hosted only on Thursday nights. Kennedy took occasional nights off to be replaced by [[Fred Parslow]], [[Jimmy Hannan]], and Philip Brady. Despite resistance from network executives to the varied hosting line-up, the ratings remained strong.<ref>Blundell (2003), p. 227-8.</ref>\n\nIn January 1962 the national ''Graham Kennedy's Channel 9 Show'' was cancelled and replaced by ''The Channel 9 Show'' hosted by Bert Newton.<ref>Blundell (2003), p. 232.</ref> Kennedy continued to fine-tune his ''IMT'' performances. Kennedy had a strong understanding of key technical elements of television and perfected his comic timing, and watched the lenses on the TV cameras, adjusting his performance depending on whether he was in a wide shot or a close up.<ref>Blundell (2003), p. 223.</ref> Compilation highlight programs of ''IMT'' segments were screened in Sydney, Perth, Brisbane and Adelaide in May 1963 under the title ''The Best of Kennedy''. ''The Best of Kennedy'' continued until December 1963.<ref>Blundell (2003), p. 244.</ref> On ''IMT'', [[Noel Ferrier]] was appointed the new Friday night host. Also in 1963 writer [[Mike McColl-Jones]] joined. Kennedy had often disliked having writers on the program, was reluctant for them to be publicly acknowledged, and often ignored all their material. In the case of McColl-Jones, Kennedy seemed to like him and his comedy material, which was apparently the key requirement by which Kennedy would use a writer's material. McColl-Jones continued as a writer on the series for several years. Also in 1963 [[Ernie Carroll]] joined the writing team. Kennedy had apparently relaxed his attitude towards writers by this stage and seemed happy to use their material with few complaints.<ref>Blundell (2003), p. 239-42.</ref>\n\nIn 1964 Bert Newton abruptly disappeared from the program. It was not publicly acknowledged at the time but he had suffered a nervous breakdown. After a long absence he returned to appear on the Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday evening episodes. On 14 June 1965 ''IMT'' reached its 2,000th instalment and more people watched the show per capita than any other television program in the world.<ref>Blundell (2003), p. 245-8.</ref>\n\nBy this stage Fred Parslow was well established on the program's writing team and was a confidante of Kennedy's.\n<blockquote>\nWhen he was really down, depressed about things. A relationship had failed. He rang me in a terrible state and asked me to go down to his house in Frankston. Joan, my wife, said you better go. He sounded really desperate. There wasn't much he could do for such a long time. Of course, when he did start to get brave, he was too old for going around and picking up what he might enjoy. He was the first of our mega stars; there seem to be mega stars everywhere now. In those days, living in such a Sleepy Hollow like Melbourne, he found his life terribly, terribly difficult. And you can understand in those days. The times have changed. It's almost compulsory to be homosexual now.<ref>Blundell (2003), p. 250.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nOn 7 July 1965 Kennedy appeared on a then-innovative live split-screen link with [[Don Lane]], the host of ''Sydney Tonight'', via the recently completed co-axial cable linking Melbourne and Sydney. Starting late September 1966, ''IMT'' itself was transmitted to Sydney via the coaxial cable. This coincided with a cameo in the film ''[[They're a Weird Mob (film)|They're a Weird Mob]]'' in which Kennedy plays himself. Like the film's protagonist, Kennedy in the film finds Sydney to be a city somewhat unwelcoming towards migrants from anywhere.<ref>Blundell (2003), p. 254-5.</ref> By early December 1966 ratings for Kennedy's show were strong in Sydney. There was an increase from one ''IMT'' episode a week in Sydney, to two, with a Monday night broadcast added that month.<ref>Blundell (2003), p. 257.</ref>\n\nBy 1968 there was a regular roster of ''IMT'' guest hosts, including Bert Newton, [[Tim Evans (entertainer)|Tim Evans]], [[Bobby Limb]], [[Don Lane]], [[Kevin Sanders (television)|Kevin Sanders]], and [[Michael Preston]].<ref>Blundell (2003), p. 269.</ref> The announcement of Kennedy's intention to leave ''IMT'' was made in October 1969 and he left the show on the expiration of his contract 23 December 1969. His final episode features newsreader [[Eric Pearce (broadcaster)|Sir Eric Pearce]] placing on his head a crown made by the Channel Nine prop department in the style of that worn by [[Henry IV of England|Henry IV]], symbolising Kennedy's reign as King of Australian television.<ref>Blundell (2003), p. 273.</ref>\n\nIn 2007, the crown (which a private collector had recognised at a junk store in Bowral NSW, and purchased for $5) was auctioned for more than $17,000 to a producer of the Seven Network's ''[[Sunrise (Australian TV program)|Sunrise]]'' program.<ref name=\"The Crown\">[http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/story/0,23663,21602248-10229,00.html Kennedy's crown fetches $17K] news.com.au, 23 April 2007</ref>\n\n=== Comedic style ===\nKennedy deliberately pushed the boundaries of acceptability in a [[Social conservatism|socially conservative]] era. Inspired by stage comedians such as [[Roy Rene]], his style was bawdy, irreverent, iconoclastic, often smutty, sometimes deliberately [[Camp (style)|camp]], and laden with [[innuendo]] and double-entendre. He regularly overstepped the boundaries of accepted \"good taste\", once telling a fan \"There are no limits, love, there are no limits.\"<ref>Blundell (2003), p. 379</ref>\n\nJournalist Megan Gressor described Kennedy's style as having \"... mongrel roots \u2013 a hybrid of vaudeville, slapstick and endless suggestiveness, plus a subliminal subversiveness all his own. It seems almost pantomimic to modern eyes, but Kennedy was a product of simpler times. And more complex. His was an act predicated upon repression; naughtiness loses its point in a world without taboos, where anything goes. It wouldn't work today, when people don't just say \"fuck\" on television, they do it.\"<ref name=\"gressor\">[http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/04/25/1050777394925.html \"King of comedy, fears of a clown\"]: Megan Gressor, ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]'', 26 April 2003</ref>\n\n====Advertisements====\nDrawing on his radio experience with Nicky (who had routinely \"sent up\" advertisers), Kennedy transformed the live commercials from what would have otherwise been dull pro-forma obligations into a unique comedic art form. On one famous occasion, a scheduled 20-second ad spot for an aspirin product was spun out into 33 minutes of improvised comedy.\n\nNewton has written:\n\n<blockquote>\nThe blood would drain from the face of [[Pelaco]] shirt-wearing executives in television, advertising and business until they realised that instead of televisual suicide, this skinny little wiseguy was commercial gold. And then they liked his brand of humour a lot.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\nA commercial I shared with Graham, Raoul Merton ('of comfort you're certain when you wear Raoul Merton') changed the footwear buying habits of men.<ref>Newton, Bert (1977). Op Cit, p. 91</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n===Sam Chisholm===\n[[Gerald Stone]] recounts in his book ''Compulsive Viewing'' that a \"cocky young salesman\" visited the IMT set hoping for an extra plug for his employer's product. The young salesman was [[Sam Chisholm]], who later became a senior executive for variously the [[Kerry Packer|Packer]] and [[Rupert Murdoch|Murdoch]] media empires. A May 2005 interview with Chisholm records:<ref name=\"ninemsn_chisolm_2005\">{{cite web |url=http://www.sunday.ninemsn.com.au/sunday/cover_stories/transcript_1864.asp |title=50 years of television, Part two (transcript)|publisher=NineMSN |work=Sunday |author=Davis, Graham|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060827002708/http://www.sunday.ninemsn.com.au/sunday/cover_stories/transcript_1864.asp |archivedate=27 August 2006}}</ref>\n\n:Sam Chisholm: ''I was working for Johnson's wax at the time, and I don't think he believed my ...''\n:Graham Davis: ''Sales pitch.''\n:Sam Chisholm: ''Assertions about this product.

I started off as his housekeeper and ended up being his boss.''\n\n===Rover===\nKennedy requested a \"reject\" dog from the [[Jack Davey]] Memorial Guide Dog Centre and was given a [[Labrador Retriever]] which he named \"Rover\".\n\nRover was sometimes brought into the studio to assist with advertisements for Pal dog food. One night the dog showed no interest whatsoever in the product, which Kennedy then himself proceeded to eat with apparent relish, straight from the can \u2013 or so it seemed.\n\nRover also achieved television immortality by relieving himself \u2013 live to air \u2013 upon one of the huge cameras. The studio audience collapsed in hysterics, but the duration and urgency of Rover's impressively hydraulic performance might have led some cynics to question just how impromptu the event really was.\n\nBiographer Blundell quotes Ernie Carroll:\n\n<blockquote>\nPal dog food, with Rover [...] was time consuming [...] once we fed him all afternoon so that when he came out to do the commercial he didn't want to touch the Pal dog food. He was already full of it. [...] on another occasion they had him drink before the show, big drinks. So when he came out, he peed all over the camera and all around the set [...] Even those seemingly innocent dog manoeuvres were carefully planned.\n</blockquote>\n\nKennedy was exasperated for decades by questions about ''\"whatever happened to Rover\"''. As late as 1989, on ''Graham Kennedy's News Hour'' (see below), he answered a viewer's question couched in exactly those words with the withering reply ''\"... he was a dog. What do you think happened?\"''\n\nIn early June 2005, on the [[3AW]] program ''Nightline'' with Philip Brady and [[Bruce Mansfield]], Patti (McGrath) Newton stated that her father had often looked after Rover when he appeared at GTV-9. It seems that Kennedy had become increasingly irritated with retrieving Rover from the pound and so, when Patti's father's dog died, Rover went on to a long and happy life at the McGrath (senior) household.\n\n===''The Graham Kennedy Show''===\n{{main|The Graham Kennedy Show}}\nAfter specials on 15 November 1971 and 2 March 1972, Kennedy returned to regular television with ''[[The Graham Kennedy Show]]'' on 19 September 1972. This series lasted until late 1973. In 1974, when Kennedy claimed he wanted a rest, Nine allegedly paid him not to sign with another network. It was [[Frank Packer]] who paid Kennedy $50,000 to do nothing, as he was fearful he would work for someone else. Kennedy said in 1978:\n\n:It wasn't a retainer. It was $50,000 not to work. Sir Frank didn't know it but I had no intention of working.<ref>[[TV Week]] magazine, 11 March 1978 \u2013 \"Graham Hasn't Conquered Those Jitters\" by Ben Mitchell pp58-59</ref>\n\nThe Graham Kennedy Show resumed in March 1975, and was Kennedy's first series in colour.\n\nMemorable, and controversial, moments, included the \"crow call\" controversy where, on 3 March 1975, Kennedy imitated a crow call (\"faaaaaark\") highly reminiscent of the word \"[[fuck]]\". This led the [[Australian Broadcasting Control Board]] to request that Kennedy \"show cause\" why he should not be removed from the airwaves.<ref>{{cite news|title=Kennedy faces a total ban on TV|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=XVoQAAAAIBAJ&sjid=OpIDAAAAIBAJ&pg=3156%2C949082|accessdate=23 December 2014|work=The Age (Melbourne)|date=1975-03-05|ref=46}}</ref> Kennedy replied that he could not show cause,<ref>{{cite news|title=Kennedy case to be heard on Tuesday|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=N_xjAAAAIBAJ&sjid=m-YDAAAAIBAJ&pg=904%2C3520849|accessdate=23 December 2014|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=1975-03-12|ref=47}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Order to Kennedy producer - threat to two TV shows|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=MvxjAAAAIBAJ&sjid=m-YDAAAAIBAJ&pg=3160%2C1897513|accessdate=23 December 2014|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=1975-03-07|ref=48}}</ref> suggesting that the Board take action to limit his appearances, while hinting at legal action should they do so.<ref>{{cite news|title=Court threat by Kennedy|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=NvxjAAAAIBAJ&sjid=m-YDAAAAIBAJ&pg=5757%2C3373285|accessdate=23 December 2014|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=1975-03-11|ref=49}}</ref> Rather than removing him, the ABCB banned Kennedy from appearing live, forcing him to pre-record the show on videotape.<ref>{{cite news|title=TV and radio ban on 'live' Kennedy|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=PvxjAAAAIBAJ&sjid=m-YDAAAAIBAJ&pg=3781%2C4968719|accessdate=23 December 2014|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=1975-03-19|ref=50}}</ref>\n\nAnother notable moment was from 17 April 1975, when Kennedy attacked Senator [[Doug McClelland]], the then Minister for the Media, over local content issues. His comments were edited, and a voiceover recorded by the general manager was inserted saying that Kennedy had made a \"cowardly attack on a Labor Minister who was unable to defend himself.\"\n\nFollowing the McClelland incident, Kennedy parted company with the Nine Network, but later returned.\n\n===''Power Without Glory''===\nKennedy appeared as Clive Parker in an episode of the 26-part ABC drama ''[[Power Without Glory]]'', which began on 21 June 1976.\n\n===''Blankety Blanks''===\nHe returned to television in 1977 for what is now [[Network Ten]] to host a comedy game show, ''[[Blankety Blanks (Australian game show)|Blankety Blanks]]''. It dominated early evening television over two seasons, between 7 February 1977 and 15 September 1978. The show featured friends from his earlier days including [[Noeline Brown]], [[Barry Creyton]], [[Noel Ferrier]], [[Ugly Dave Gray]], [[Carol Raye]] and [[Stuart Wagstaff]]. It was only after the show became a ratings success and the network's most profitable program that it revealed Kennedy was paid an unprecedented $1 million per season.<ref>{{cite book|title=Graham Kennedy Treasures: Friends Remember the King|page=49|author=Mike McColl-Jones|publisher=Miegunyah Press|year=2008|isbn=0522855458}}</ref>\n\nIn 1979, \"The King\" became ''[[Moomba|King of Moomba]]'' complete with his famous motorised desk, the second Melbourne-born recipient after [[Bert Newton|Newton]].<ref>Craig Bellamy, Gordon Chisholm, Hilary Eriksen (17 February 2006).

Retrieved 29 June 2008.</ref>\n\n===''Graham Kennedy's News Show''===\n\nNearly 60, Kennedy accepted an offer from the Nine Network's managing director Sam Chisholm to present ''[[Graham Kennedy's News Show]]'' from Sydney, to air five nights a week at 10:30&nbsp;pm against Clive Robertson's ''Newsworld'' on the Seven Network.<ref>Blundell (2003), pp. 369\u2013372</ref> Five trial programs were recorded but never broadcast.<ref>Blundell (2003), p. 373</ref>\n\nKennedy initially \"pulled the plug\" and withdrew from the show but returned (see Harry M. Miller, below). Kennedy's contract stipulated that his co-presenter would be sports commentator [[Ken Sutcliffe]].<ref>Blundell (2003), p. 371</ref>\n\nKennedy's writers, who worked from a production cottage at the corner of Scott Street and Artarmon Road included Jim Pike, Tim Evans, Larry Burns, and Ken Stirling. Blundell records:\n\n<blockquote>\nThey worked in the back room shooting out gags over typewriters and word processors, united in their hatred of the 'Little Guy', as they also called him.\"<ref>Blundell (2003), p. 382</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nThe writers also referred to Kennedy as \"the little buggle-eyed bastard\",.<ref name=\"Blundell 2003, p. 383\">Blundell (2003), p. 383</ref> However, they admired his talent. Jim Pike said, \".. I hate him, but he is the best there is\".<ref name=\"Blundell 2003, p. 383\"/>\n\nKennedy defied convention with remarks which were tasteless, and yet hilarious. Pointing out the irony of how a news show gets good ratings he said it would be helpful for his show's ratings if the Pope's aircraft were to fly into a mountain while it was full of orphans.  He also remarked that Queen Elizabeth II \"didn't have bad breasts ... for a woman of her age\" and mocked 17 October 1989, San Francisco Loma Prieta earthquake with a re-creation on the set.\n\nAfter a slightly heavy woman was caught for streaking at a cricket match, Graham explained on air that they would run the footage but had to cover certain offending parts of her body with black.  The clip he played was all black, except for a single spot that revealed her pubic hair.\n\nHe also reprised the \"Chum Song\" from Melbourne radio days, saying that it originated in a 1920s children's newspaper column in Scotland. In Nancy Lee's book ''Being a Chum Was Fun'' she writes:<ref>Lee, Nancy (1979). Op Cit, p.67</ref>\n\n<blockquote>The Chum Song, I believe, was written and recorded in Glasgow in 1930 by Jack Hylton's orchestra for a Scottish Newsboys Club. The recording Kennedy used to close the program was provided by Melbourne music Historian Alex Hehr </blockquote>\n\nThe lyrics of the chorus are:\n\n<blockquote>\n:''Being a chum is fun,''\n:''That is why I'm one;''\n:''Always smiling, always gay,''\n:''Chummy at work,''\n:''(and) chummy at play -''\n:''Laugh away your worries,''\n:''Don't be sad or glum;''\n:''And everyone will know that you're a ''\n:''Chum, chum, chum!''\n</blockquote>\n\nSutcliffe would \"corpse\", with tears in his eyes, unable to continue; this became so frequent that Kennedy managed to coin a catchphrase, \"I love it when he cries\".\n\nKennedy called Sutcliffe \"Two Dogs\" after delivering a joke ending with the tag \"Why do you ask,  Two Dogs Rooting?\"\n\nGraham Kennedy's News Show was a rarity in that it was a live news show that had a studio audience.  Five nights a week for most of the year, audiences lined up at 10:30 at night just to see Kennedy do his magic in the flesh.  Often the funniest parts of the show were in the commercial breaks when Kennedy would come down and join the audience for a chat.  He always made a point of telling them a particularly crude joke that was timed so they got the punchline just a second before the show was back on air.\n\n===''Coast to Coast''===\nOn 13 February 1989 the show became ''Coast to Coast'', with Nine journalist John Mangos replacing Sutcliffe, and ran until 8 December 1989.\n\n===Harry M. Miller===\nKennedy engaged [[Harry M. Miller]] as his agent. According to biographer Blundell, Kennedy believed that Miller was to donate his commission of $2500 per week to the [[Wayside Chapel]] for Kennedy's appearance on ''Graham Kennedy's News Show''.<ref>Blundell (2003), p. 374</ref>\n\nMiller later sued Kennedy for ''\"wrongful termination and for a 20 per cent commission on his 1989 gross earnings.\"''<ref>Blundell (2003), p. 387</ref> During the court case Miller ''\"painted a picture of his client of twenty years as a late-night drunk in the habit of sending demanding faxes while under the influence.\"''<ref>Blundell (2003), p. 388</ref> Justice Brownie found against Miller, and ordered him to pay $75,699 and costs.\n\n===''Graham Kennedy's Funniest Home Videos''===\nKennedy's last series was ''[[Australia's Funniest Home Video Show|Graham Kennedy's Funniest Home Video Show]]'' which was broadcast between 29 March and 15 November 1990 on the Nine Network.\n\n===''35 Years of Television''===\nKennedy presented the introduction segment to the [[Nine Network]] special ''35 Years of Television'' in 1991. The segment covered the very early days of television variety, including his own ''In Melbourne Tonight''.\n\n===Last television appearance===\nKennedy's last television appearance was in February 1994 in an interview for ''Ray Martin Presents Graham Kennedy's Sixtieth''. Believing that [[Ray Martin (television presenter)|Martin]] had ambushed him by departing from a pre-agreed list of questions, Kennedy ensured that much of the interview was unusable for broadcast by peppering his responses with obscenities.\n\nIn 2005 John Mangos wrote:\n<blockquote>He (Kennedy) later explained the experience in a piece for [[TV Week]] in an article called 'In his own words'.\n\n\"Ray Martin and I had worked together before, and he well knows that if I have the questions in advance, he'll get a better interview. Everyone knows this \u2013 politicians in particular. Ray duly faxed the questions to me, but on the morning of the recording changed them. I was bewildered by this (I think a researcher let him down). I terminated the interview when I didn't know what he was talking about and went upstairs to lunch.\"\n\nIt was a critical turning point in his career. He vowed never to do television again.<ref name=\"Mangos\"/></blockquote>\n\nRay Martin denied any ill intent, saying \"We faxed a series of general topics, but it was clear at the outset that much would depend on the general run of the interview [...] An ambush was not on the agenda [...] He had no complaints. There was never a suggestion that he was unhappy.\"<ref>Blundell (2003), pps. 409, 410</ref>\n\n===Logie awards===\nKennedy coined the name [[Logie Award]] in 1960, after the inventor of television, [[John Logie Baird]].\n\nKennedy received many Logies, including:\n\n* 5 [[Gold Logie Award for Most Popular Personality on Australian Television|Gold Logie]]s for the Most Popular Personality on Australian Television (1960, 1967, 1969, 1974, and 1978).\n**He also won the \"TV Week Awards' Star of the Year\" award at the inaugural presentation in 1959, and this is sometimes counted as his first Gold Logie, which would give him 6 in total\n* a Special Logie Award \u2013 the ''Star of the Decade'' in 1967\n* a [[List of Logie Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]] Logie Award in 1998. He did not attend the ceremony; the award was accepted on his behalf by Bert Newton.\n\n==Film career==\nKennedy appeared in a number of films, ranging from brief cameos to leading roles. They include:\n\n* ''[[On the Beach (1959 film)|On the Beach]]'' (1959) as Minor Role (uncredited)\n* ''[[They're a Weird Mob (film)|They're a Weird Mob]]'' (1966) as Himself (cameo)\n* ''[[The Box (soap opera)|The Box]]'' (1975, supporting role) as Himself\n* ''[[Don's Party]]'' (1976) as Mack / design engineer\n* ''[[The Odd Angry Shot]]'' (1979) as Harry\n* ''[[The Club (1980 film)|The Club]]'' (1980) as Ted Parker\n* ''[[Silent Reach]]'' (1983, TV Mini-Series) as Chasser Fitzpatrick\n* ''[[The Return of Captain Invincible]]'' (1983) as Prime Minister (cameo)\n* ''[[The Killing Fields (film)|The Killing Fields]]'' (1984) as Dougal\n* ''[[Stanley (1984 film)|Stanley]]'' (1984) as Norm Norris\n* ''[[Les Patterson Saves the World]]'' (1987) as Brian Lannigan\n* ''[[Travelling North]]'' (1987) as Freddie (final film role)\n\nHe also had a cameo in ''[[On the Beach (1959 film)|On the Beach]]'' (1959) which was not used.<ref name=\"on_the_beach_cameo\">{{cite web | url=http://delarue.net/beach.htm | title=On The Beach |work=On the Beach| accessdate=3 June 2007}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\n<blockquote>Being a period of that era of the 1950s I think being gay must have been pretty harsh for Graham. I can imagine...everybody knew, nobody cared, but I think it was such a time when you didn't talk about issues that were personal, and I think that made him much more secretive and reclusive, and I think that was probably quite a tough thing for him... \u2014 Susan Gaye Anderson''<ref name=\"RealDVD\"/></blockquote>\n\nKennedy himself never publicly acknowledged that he was gay, but his homosexuality was considered an open secret within the Australian entertainment industry.\n\nIn the 1960s [[Bob Dyer]] described him as \"probably the loneliest young man in Australia.\"<ref>Blundell (2003), p. 164</ref>\n\nIn 1973 Melbourne newspapers reported that Kennedy was engaged to 28-year-old Australian singer [[Lana Cantrell]], who became a successful New York lawyer. Many years later, Kennedy wrote to a newspaper that a photographer, taking pictures of him and Cantrell leaving a restaurant together asked if he could \"hint at a romance\". The following Sunday a poster proclaimed \"Graham and Lana to wed\".<ref>Blundell (2003), p. 361.</ref> His former housekeeper, Devona Fox, in the 2009 television documentary ''[[The Real Graham Kennedy]]'', produced by Bob Phillips, one of the producers from Kennedy's breakthrough Channel 9 program ''[[In Melbourne Tonight]]'', is quoted as saying:\n\n<blockquote>Graham always told me right early on that he would never get married. He told me that his life was devastated when his parents split up, and he said straight out, \"Mrs Fox, I'll never get married\", so I never expected anything more of him than what did happen. Even when Lana Cantrell came into the scene I was puzzled and I did say to him why all this, and of course we all know it was good publicity. Lana came to the house and I had to go up, and have it all cleaned, ready for her and her party to come one Sunday night. And then on the Monday night, this great big announcement was going to be made that he was supposed to be engaged to Lana Cantrell.

He was [[diabetic]], and a heavy smoker and drinker. Throughout his illnesses, his friends Tony Sattler and Noeline Brown rallied to his aid.\n\nOn 18 December 2001 his housekeeper found him unconscious and dehydrated. Sattler said \"Between the diabetes and the booze, there's not much left of him\", adding that the death of Kennedy's dog Henry was \"the final trigger\".<ref>Blundell (2003), p. 418</ref>\n\nOn 14 June 2002 Kennedy was found unconscious at the foot of the stairs at his home, suffering a broken leg and skull with suspected brain damage.<ref>Blundell (2003), p. 429</ref>\n\nHis Canyonleigh property was sold, and he moved into a townhouse and later a nursing home.\n\n===Benefactor===\nDespite a career of high earnings, press reports said that his financial situation was, while not disastrous, insufficient to fund his ongoing care. Having made millions for the Packer family interests, he believed that \"''the Packers will always look after me''\".\n\nAccording to [[Graeme Blundell]]'s biography, Tony Sattler:\n\n<blockquote>\n[...]spent several days ringing Kerry Packer's office [...] Nursing was going to cost $3000 a week. 'We could cope for several years but not longer''. [...] ''After three days Di Stone, Mr Packer's personal assistant, called Sattler back: 'Mr Packer has considered his plight.

He can't walk any more and gets around in a wheelchair as a result of the diabetes and the years of heavy smoking.</blockquote>\n\nActor Graeme Blundell, who had worked with Kennedy on the movie ''The Odd Angry Shot'', published a biography of Kennedy, ''King: The Life and Comedy of Graham Kennedy'' (MacMillan, 2003). A newspaper report stated that Kennedy ''\"passed on his best wishes but declined to be involved 'for no particular reason [...] other than he believes he has a limited memory of many of the facts of his life'.\"''<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/05/03/1051876902018.html | title=Here's Graham |work=The Age|date= 3 May 2003 | accessdate=16 September 2008 | location=Melbourne}}</ref> The book, which was completed before Kennedy's death, ends with \"''Graham read them [chapters of an early draft] ... asked if he wished to read any more, 'No', Graham Kennedy said.

His wasted and frail, aching body could take no more. I paid a short and emotional visit. Still, the ashtray was by his bedside next to a radio tuned to ABC Radio National. I leaned over to kiss him on the forehead and he whispered, 'Don't get too close, it hurts'.<ref name=\"Mangos\"/>\n</blockquote>\n\nHe also wrote:\n\n<blockquote>\nI was often asked if he had cancer or AIDS. In fact at 67, he had diabetes, some rheumatism, the odd creaky joint, a healthy capacity to whinge and the usual symptoms connected with smoking and drinking. But by now the horses were gone and the dog had died. He was eating less and drinking more. One night, he fell down the stairs. He was discovered the next morning on the floor by his housekeeper. He was rushed to the local hospital where pneumonia in one lung was treated effectively and efficiently, a fracture near his hip was repaired and he was diagnosed with brain damage. We were to learn he had Korsakoff's syndrome (an alcohol-related condition) and we decided to keep it private.<ref name=\"Mangos\"/>\n</blockquote>\n\n[[Korsakoff's syndrome]] is a form of [[amnesia]] seen in chronic [[alcoholics]]; briefly stated, victims eat too little and drink too much.\n\n===Derryn Hinch controversy===\nAfter his death, controversial [[Melbourne]]-based [[3AW]] radio broadcaster [[Derryn Hinch]] alleged that Kennedy had died from an [[AIDS]]-related disease. This was strenuously denied by his friends and carers [[Noeline Brown]] and [[Tony Sattler]], and as a result Kennedy's biographer Graeme Blundell then published Kennedy's medical records, including a recent negative HIV test, to disprove this allegation. Hinch fought back saying he didn't say Kennedy had AIDS, but that he was homosexual, had symptoms similar to those of [[Kaposi's sarcoma]], and died of [[pneumonia]], thus implying Kennedy's death was AIDS-related.\n\n===Funeral===\nTony Sattler offered the [[Nine Network]] the right to televise the funeral but it declined, claiming it could not justify the cost of the outside broadcast. The [[Seven Network]] accepted, and gave coverage free of charge to the Nine Network. Hence, the one-hour funeral service was aired simultaneously across both Seven and Nine networks.\n\n[[Stuart Wagstaff]] presented the funeral, which was attended by many of Kennedy's friends, colleagues and associates on the morning of 31 May 2005 at a small community theatre in the town of [[Mittagong]]. At the end of the funeral Kennedy's coffin was carried by players from the [[St Kilda Football Club]], the [[Australian rules football]] team he supported.\n\nWagstaff's eulogy alluded to the claims made by Derryn Hinch about the cause of Kennedy's death:\n\n<blockquote>Delivering a eulogy for a close friend and for someone who was so much admired is never a happy occasion. Though I must confess I would be quite happy to deliver a eulogy for a certain media personality who's tried the second Kennedy assassination of our time... and failed.<ref>{{cite news\n |url=http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0%2C21985%2C15471683-662%2C00.html \n |title=Last laugh for the King of TV \n |work=Herald Sun \n |location=Australia \n |publisher=News.com.au \n |accessdate=26 January 2008 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080204074118/http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0%2C21985%2C15471683-662%2C00.html \n |archivedate=4 February 2008 \n |df=dmy-all \n}}</ref><ref>{{cite news\n |url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/People/Classic-variety-hour-farewell/2005/05/31/1117305621699.html |title=Classic variety hour farewell | accessdate=26 January 2008 | location=Melbourne |work=The Age| date=1 June 2005}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nKennedy had never explicitly stated that he was homosexual, but at his funeral his friends were at last free to make jokes in a friendly way.\n\n''[[The Age]]'' newspaper, on 26 June 2005, reported John Mangos as saying that he \"knew Kennedy wanted his ashes scattered at sea.

of Australia|AO]] (15 February 1934 \u2013 25 May 2005) was an Australian entertainer, comedian and variety performer, as well as a personality and star of radio, theatre, television and film. he often performed in the style of vaudevillian and radio comedy star [[Roy Rene]]<ref name=\"theage\"\">{{cite web|url=https://theage.co.au/entertainment/celebrity/death-of-a-tv-giant-20050526-ge08ik.html|title=Death of a TV giant}}</ref>and was often called \"Gra Gra\" (pronounced \"gray-gray\"). Honoured as an officer of the [[Order of Australia]], he was a six-time recipient of the [[Gold Logie]], including the [[List of Logie Hall of Fame inductees|Logie Hall of Fame]] award, and won the Star of the Year Award in 1959. He is the most awarded star of [[Australian television]]. He was often referred to as \"The King\" or the \"King of Australian television\". He was best known for his collaborations with Australian entertainer [[Bert Newton]] and American-born television personality [[Don Lane]].\n\n==Early life==\n\n===Childhood===\nKennedy was born in Camden Street, [[Balaclava, Victoria|Balaclava]] to Cyril William Kennedy and Mary Austen Kennedy (n\u00e9e Scott).<ref>{{cite book\n | first = Graeme\n | last = Blundell\n | authorlink = Graeme Blundell\n | year = 2003\n | title = King: The Life and Comedy of Graham Kennedy\n | publisher = Pan Macmillan\n | location = Sydney\n | isbn = 0-7329-1165-6}}</ref> Kennedy's mother, who was 18 years old at the time of his birth,<ref name=\"Blundell 2003, p. 9\">Blundell (2003), p. 9</ref> was employed at a local picture theatre. His father worked variously as an engineer and handyman, mowed lawns and washed cars.

Kennedy later said that he had:\n<blockquote>often wished his mother and father had never married. 'I wasn't enamoured of either of them [...] they betrayed me [...] divorce is not too much fun for a little nine-year-old [...]<ref>Blundell (2003), p. 351</ref>\n</blockquote>\nAfter Kennedy's death, an article in ''[[The Bulletin (Australian periodical)|The Bulletin]]'' by his friend and colleague [[John Mangos]] recorded that:\n<blockquote>... he would sometimes talk about the violent arguments between his parents, how he gravitated to his grandmother's bosom, his two uncles (\"one fought the Germans, the other fought the Japs\") and how one of them took liberties with the boy.

He accepted a job as a news runner from Collins Street to the ABC studios in Lonsdale Street. Shortly after he joined radio station [[3UZ]], working in the station's record library.<ref>Blundell (2003), p. 28. The MHSOBA obituary records that his report card states \"he was employed by Radio Australia (Short-wave Division) at 475 Collins Street Melbourne after leaving school. However, during 4th form at Melbourne High School, he worked as a messenger at the ABC on Wednesday nights from 5&nbsp;pm to 11&nbsp;pm.\"</ref>\n\n==Radio career==\n\n===3UZ and \"Nicky\"===\nMelbourne's most popular commercial radio personality was arguably [[Nicky Whitta|Clifford \"Nicky\" Nicholls Whitta]]. A radio performer since 1932, he presented a popular housewives' program, as well as \"Chatterbox Corner\" with his wife Nancy Lee (Kathleen Lindgren).\n\nIn an era when Australian radio announcers routinely adopted false British accents{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} and a \"hard sell\" approach to advertisements, Whitta's authentic Australian voice and irreverent attitude towards his sponsors made him the idol of his audience. By the early 1950s a newspaper survey found that more than 70 per cent of Melbourne housewives tuned into his show.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}\n\nIn his foreword to Nancy Lee's book ''Being a Chum Was Fun'' (1979) Kennedy wrote:\n\n<blockquote>\nAbout 40 years ago, when I was a snow haired six year old, I can remember being totally captivated by a grown man pretending to be a naughty little boy on [[3AW]]'s children session called \"Chatterbox Corner\". His name was Clifford Whitta, and he was to become the most important man in my life. Years later I was even more fascinated with this man when he conducted a breakfast program and let the boy who played his records '''actually talk on the air with him'''.<ref>{{cite book\n | first = Nancy\n | last = Lee\n | year = 1979\n | title = Being a Chum was Fun: the Story of Nancy Lee\n | publisher = Listen & Learn Productions\n | location = Melbourne\n | isbn = 0-9596136-1-7}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nNicholls moved from [[3KZ]] to [[3UZ]] (where Kennedy was working), bringing with him his teenage panel operators Alf \"Alfie Boy\" Thesinger and Russell Archer. However, eighteen-year-olds, Thesinger and Archer were \"called up\" (conscripted) for National Service. Nancy Lee's book records:\n\n<blockquote>\nI asked Nicky, \"Have you decided on anyone to help you in the session yet?\" When I heard the chosen one was to be young Graham, I was surprised. \"Oh, no, not Graham! [...] he's a nice boy, but he can't talk.\" Nick said, \"Mum, leave him to me.\"<ref>Lee, Nancy (1979), p. 149.</ref></blockquote>\n\nNicky became father-figure, personal friend and mentor to Kennedy, and the two built an extraordinary on-air rapport. Kennedy wrote:\n<blockquote>\nBeing straight man to one of the greatest entertainers of our time was not all that easy. We were not always chums. He would spend weeks not talking to me (except on air) for something I had unknowingly said or done. Once he even suspended me from the programme for some trivial matter. [...] I worked with him until his sudden death in 1956. I never stopped being a fan. I did not realise then that I had been prepared for another career on another electrical medium: the most potent communication device of the century.''<ref>Lee, Nancy (1979), foreword by GK. Elided text: \"'But it was more than worthwhile putting up with his various moods and it must be remembered that he in turn was putting up with a very gauche seventeen year old. And of course, he taught me so much: how to use radio not just be on it. He took me under his wing and became a surrogate father. I spend many happy times with him and his family at his house in Ivanhoe. They were very special occasions for me. I baby sat for him and Kathy a few times.'\n</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nNicky died on 8 September 1956.\n\n===Other radio===\nBy May 1957, Kennedy was appearing on television, but also presented a [[3AK]] morning radio program with [[Bert Newton]] in 1961\u20131962, which later originated from a studio built at Kennedy's home in [[Olivers Hill]], [[Frankston, Victoria|Frankston]].\n\nIn 1970 he worked at [[3XY]]; from June to December 1975 he appeared on a [[3LO]] drivetime program with Richard Combe; from September to November 1976 was on [[3TTT|3DB]] with Denis Scanlan; in 1977 he returned to DB to cover the [[Silver Jubilee of Elizabeth II]] live from London.\n\n===RS Playhouse===\nKennedy recorded eight thirty-minute radio comedies for the ABC under the title ''[[Graham Kennedy's RS Playhouse]]''. Written by [[Gary Reilly]] and [[Tony Sattler]] (who together wrote the television programs ''[[Kingswood Country]]'' and ''[[The Naked Vicar Show]]''), the shows were broadcast between 11 August and 23 September 1979.\n\nThe episode titles were:\n\n*\"The Birthday Boy\"\n*\"Because He's My Brother\"\n*\"You Only Live Once\"\n*\"Sunday Morning Fever\"\n*\"The Chocolate Milkman\"\n*\"The Prawnbroker\"\n*\"Mad Jack's Dentist\"\n*\"The Good Morning Show\"\n\nSattler and his wife (actress [[Noeline Brown]]) were two of Kennedy's closest friends.\n\n===2Day FM===\nIn 1980 Kennedy became a ten percent shareholder in Sydney radio station [[2Day FM]] and from 24 May 1981 presented a computer-edited, three-hour Sunday morning program of music and comedy.<ref>Blundell (2003), pp. 350\u2013351</ref>\n\n==Television career==\n\nKennedy's first television appearance was in March 1957, representing 3UZ on a [[GTV-9]] [[Red Cross]] [[telethon]]. Viewing his performance on the monitors, GTV-9's general manager [[Colin Bednall]] and producer Norman Spencer ''\"... turned to one another without exchanging a word and shook hands.\"''<ref>{{cite book\n | first = Gerald\n | last = Stone\n | authorlink = Gerald Stone\n | year = 2000\n | title = Compulsive Viewing: The inside story that rocked the TV industry\n | publisher = Penguin Books\n | location = Victoria\n | isbn = 0-14-029817-7}}\n\"'When a full face of Kennedy alone came on the monitor, Spencer and I turned to one another without exchanging a word and shook hands. At the time, we were in desperate need of talent. At a glance, you could see that this boy on camera, with his cheap haircut and popping eyes, had gone to endless pains rehearsing his act and also had outstanding ability. When we talked to Kennedy he made no attempt at playing hard to get. He was busting to get into television.'\"\n</ref>\n\n===''In Melbourne Tonight''===\n{{main|In Melbourne Tonight}}\n\n{{Dialogue\n|Bert Newton|Hello, I'm Bert Newton.\n|Graham Kennedy|Big deal.}}\n\nBednall and Spencer defied both the GTV-9 boardroom and the first sponsor (Philips) by choosing Kennedy, who began on a salary of [[Australian pound|\u00a3]]30 for five one-hour evening shows per week to be called ''[[In Melbourne Tonight]]'' (or ''IMT'') which began on 6 May 1957. Thus the 23-year-old Kennedy began a career of which he later said that he was ''\"terrified for forty years\"''.<ref>Stone (2000), p.93\n\"'I was terrified for forty years is what I can tell you about my career', he says now, confirming the stories told of him having to steel his nerves before almost every performance. 'Well, out of the thousands of television shows and radio shows, once or twice I was quite comfortable, but mostly I was frightened.'\"</ref> The show's theme song, \"[[Gee, But You're Swell]]\", was written by [[Abel Baer]] and Thomas Tobias in 1936.\n\nKennedy was not GTV-9's first choice \u2013 they had planned to use either 3UZ personality John McMahon or 3DB's Dick Cranbourne. Despite later reports that the program's name had been intended to be ''[[The Late Show (1950s Australian TV series)|The Late Show]]'', and that rival station [[HSV-7]] beat GTV-9 to the title by one week, contemporary press reports from several weeks before the show's debut list the title as \"In Melbourne Tonight\".<ref>https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=GTBVAAAAIBAJ&sjid=H5UDAAAAIBAJ&pg=5407%2C1560074</ref> The program became extremely popular, although Kennedy had his detractors. Kennedy was quoted as saying:\n<blockquote>\nMany women write to tell me that although their husbands may not like me, they do. It appears from the mail that the women have the say on what the household is watching. And we do remember that it is the women who do the buying of products that we advertise. Bearing that in mind we try and design our commercials for them.<ref>Blundell (2003), p. 216</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n''IMT'' was devised as a copy of the American 'Tonight Show' format, with the host presiding over sketches, introducing star artists and reading advertisements live. His colleague [[Bert Newton]] records in his autobiography:<ref>{{cite book\n | first = Bert\n | last = Newton\n | authorlink = Bert Newton\n | year = 1977\n | title = Bert! Bert Newton's Own Story\n | publisher = Garry Sparkes & Associates\n | location = Toorak, Victoria\n | isbn = 0-908081-24-3\n | pages = 91\u201393\n}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>\n(Norman) Spencer was the mastermind of ''IMT''; don't let anyone forget that. Nothing happened on ''IMT'' that Norm did not approve personally [...] Norman Spencer chose Graham Kennedy as comp\u00e8re; Norm kept his eye on the show from day to day; he pushed the buttons from the control room which put the TV shots into viewers' homes at night; he added the talent around Graham and he set up the organisation.\n</blockquote>\n\nSpencer wielded other influence too. According to Hugh Stuckey, a writer on the show, the producer placed Kennedy with a series of attractive young women to displace rumours of Kennedy's homosexuality.\n<blockquote>\nThis was an era in which homosexuality was, well, horrifying. So every now and again Kennedy had to be seen about in case any viewers thought him the other persuasion. [...] It was cleverly manipulated \u2013 the station had the media at its disposal. It was all to give Graham a good old hetero image though he always seemed very unsexual.<ref>Blundell (2003), p. 161</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nBy July 1959 the program was still popular in Melbourne. Recurring comedy players [[Joff Ellen]] and Rosie Sturgess became regulars. Singer [[Toni Lamond]] joined the cast. Attempts were made at this time to launch Kennedy as a ''national'' personality. Special Friday night editions of IMT were produced under the title of ''The Graham Kennedy Show'' and recorded on videotape which had just come into use. After being transmitted live in Melbourne taped copies of the show would be shipped to Adelaide, Brisbane and Sydney for transmission there on subsequent evenings.<ref>Blundell (2003), p. 185-6</ref> Producer Spencer observed there was critical and popular resistance to Kennedy in Sydney. Queensland too had shown suspicion to imports from down south trumpeted to Queenslanders as the best in Australia while Queensland itself had apparently been left out of this judgement.<ref>Blundell (2003), p. 186-7</ref>\n\n''The Graham Kennedy Show'' began in February 1960 but was not popular in Sydney. The program was judged stilted compared to IMT itself; Kennedy seemed much more subdued than usual, was tense, and the comedy was not working. Critics in Sydney and Queensland disliked key components of the show.<ref>Blundell (2003), p. 188-90</ref> Judged as a flop, ''The Graham Kennedy Show'' in Sydney was dropped by ATN7 after 13 weeks. The program however was immediately picked up by TCN9 \u2013 its general manager [[Ken G. Hall]] saw potential in the program. After continued bad reviews its popularity increased in Sydney. By July 1960 it had reached its twenty-fifth episode and had the highest ratings in Australia.<ref>Blundell (2003), p. 1892-3</ref>\n\nLater in 1960 Kennedy faced opposition when [[Sir Frank Packer]] bought GTV-9. Unlike the previous owner, Packer interfered directly with the station's activities. GTV-9 executive Colin Bednall reported that Packer hated Kennedy and forcefully articulated his desire to have him removed from the IMT.\n\n<blockquote>\nPacker had a [[homophobia|phobia about homosexuals]] and he believed Kennedy to be one. He insisted he could pick one a mile off.<ref>Stone (2000), quoting from \"an unpublished memoir now lodged with the National Library in Canberra\" by Colin Bednall. Also quoted in Blundell (2003), p. 196</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nKennedy himself was aware that Packer \"loathed\" him:\n\n<blockquote>\nSir Frank did suspect that I and others were of that persuasion. I mean if everyone in the television industry was fired because of that, there would be few around! [...] I've been accused of everything. I've been accused of being homosexual, bisexual, heterosexual and worst of all asexual, which means you don't do anything. That's cruel.<ref>Stone (2000), p. 83; quoted in Blundell (2003), p. 196-7</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nPacker's arrival prompted the departure of IMT producer Norman Spencer. IMT continued its run. Other regular performers on IMT were [[Patti Newton]] and [[Philip Brady (broadcaster)|Philip Brady]]. In 1961 Kennedy described his presentation of the program.\n\n<blockquote>\nIn the whole of the ten years I have been working on radio and television, I have been working to a majority of women. I think women prefer men to be well-mannered, so I always try to watch my manners. They like men to be well dressed, so I do my best to observe this. Others bring to my notice the fact that I sometimes make grammatical errors in my speech; so, because of this, I try to watch my grammar \u2013 but at the same time I bear in mind that it's more profitable for me to be entertaining than to be perfect in my use of English.<ref>Blundell (2003), p. 215.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nBy March 1961 the national show had been renamed ''Graham Kennedy's Channel 9 Show'' and was finding quiet acceptance nationally. Even at this time Kennedy admitted there were problems in the weekly national show.\n\n<blockquote>\nWe clam up and get tense. But I think the national show will improve in the next few weeks. We want to include the best segments of ''IMT'' in the national show. ''IMT'' is a lot more spontaneous than the national show \u2013 we've run up to an hour overtime. We like to get the audience to participate and if we can find someone interesting in the studio audience we throw away our scripts and just adlib.<ref>Blundell (2003), p. 218.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nKennedy by this stage did not always host ''IMT''. Bert Newton hosted on Monday nights. Then a September 1961 reshuffle had Toni Lamond host Monday nights and Newton hosted only on Thursday nights. Kennedy took occasional nights off to be replaced by [[Fred Parslow]], [[Jimmy Hannan]], and Philip Brady. Despite resistance from network executives to the varied hosting line-up, the ratings remained strong.<ref>Blundell (2003), p. 227-8.</ref>\n\nIn January 1962 the national ''Graham Kennedy's Channel 9 Show'' was cancelled and replaced by ''The Channel 9 Show'' hosted by Bert Newton.<ref>Blundell (2003), p. 232.</ref> Kennedy continued to fine-tune his ''IMT'' performances. Kennedy had a strong understanding of key technical elements of television and perfected his comic timing, and watched the lenses on the TV cameras, adjusting his performance depending on whether he was in a wide shot or a close up.<ref>Blundell (2003), p. 223.</ref> Compilation highlight programs of ''IMT'' segments were screened in Sydney, Perth, Brisbane and Adelaide in May 1963 under the title ''The Best of Kennedy''. ''The Best of Kennedy'' continued until December 1963.<ref>Blundell (2003), p. 244.</ref> On ''IMT'', [[Noel Ferrier]] was appointed the new Friday night host. Also in 1963 writer [[Mike McColl-Jones]] joined. Kennedy had often disliked having writers on the program, was reluctant for them to be publicly acknowledged, and often ignored all their material. In the case of McColl-Jones, Kennedy seemed to like him and his comedy material, which was apparently the key requirement by which Kennedy would use a writer's material. McColl-Jones continued as a writer on the series for several years. Also in 1963 [[Ernie Carroll]] joined the writing team. Kennedy had apparently relaxed his attitude towards writers by this stage and seemed happy to use their material with few complaints.<ref>Blundell (2003), p. 239-42.</ref>\n\nIn 1964 Bert Newton abruptly disappeared from the program. It was not publicly acknowledged at the time but he had suffered a nervous breakdown. After a long absence he returned to appear on the Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday evening episodes. On 14 June 1965 ''IMT'' reached its 2,000th instalment and more people watched the show per capita than any other television program in the world.<ref>Blundell (2003), p. 245-8.</ref>\n\nBy this stage Fred Parslow was well established on the program's writing team and was a confidante of Kennedy's.\n<blockquote>\nWhen he was really down, depressed about things. A relationship had failed. He rang me in a terrible state and asked me to go down to his house in Frankston. Joan, my wife, said you better go. He sounded really desperate. There wasn't much he could do for such a long time. Of course, when he did start to get brave, he was too old for going around and picking up what he might enjoy. He was the first of our mega stars; there seem to be mega stars everywhere now. In those days, living in such a Sleepy Hollow like Melbourne, he found his life terribly, terribly difficult. And you can understand in those days. The times have changed. It's almost compulsory to be homosexual now.<ref>Blundell (2003), p. 250.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nOn 7 July 1965 Kennedy appeared on a then-innovative live split-screen link with [[Don Lane]], the host of ''Sydney Tonight'', via the recently completed co-axial cable linking Melbourne and Sydney. Starting late September 1966, ''IMT'' itself was transmitted to Sydney via the coaxial cable. This coincided with a cameo in the film ''[[They're a Weird Mob (film)|They're a Weird Mob]]'' in which Kennedy plays himself. Like the film's protagonist, Kennedy in the film finds Sydney to be a city somewhat unwelcoming towards migrants from anywhere.<ref>Blundell (2003), p. 254-5.</ref> By early December 1966 ratings for Kennedy's show were strong in Sydney. There was an increase from one ''IMT'' episode a week in Sydney, to two, with a Monday night broadcast added that month.<ref>Blundell (2003), p. 257.</ref>\n\nBy 1968 there was a regular roster of ''IMT'' guest hosts, including Bert Newton, [[Tim Evans (entertainer)|Tim Evans]], [[Bobby Limb]], [[Don Lane]], [[Kevin Sanders (television)|Kevin Sanders]], and [[Michael Preston]].<ref>Blundell (2003), p. 269.</ref> The announcement of Kennedy's intention to leave ''IMT'' was made in October 1969 and he left the show on the expiration of his contract 23 December 1969. His final episode features newsreader [[Eric Pearce (broadcaster)|Sir Eric Pearce]] placing on his head a crown made by the Channel Nine prop department in the style of that worn by [[Henry IV of England|Henry IV]], symbolising Kennedy's reign as King of Australian television.<ref>Blundell (2003), p. 273.</ref>\n\nIn 2007, the crown (which a private collector had recognised at a junk store in Bowral NSW, and purchased for $5) was auctioned for more than $17,000 to a producer of the Seven Network's ''[[Sunrise (Australian TV program)|Sunrise]]'' program.<ref name=\"The Crown\">[http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/story/0,23663,21602248-10229,00.html Kennedy's crown fetches $17K] news.com.au, 23 April 2007</ref>\n\n=== Comedic style ===\nKennedy deliberately pushed the boundaries of acceptability in a [[Social conservatism|socially conservative]] era. Inspired by stage comedians such as [[Roy Rene]], his style was bawdy, irreverent, iconoclastic, often smutty, sometimes deliberately [[Camp (style)|camp]], and laden with [[innuendo]] and double-entendre. He regularly overstepped the boundaries of accepted \"good taste\", once telling a fan \"There are no limits, love, there are no limits.\"<ref>Blundell (2003), p. 379</ref>\n\nJournalist Megan Gressor described Kennedy's style as having \"... mongrel roots \u2013 a hybrid of vaudeville, slapstick and endless suggestiveness, plus a subliminal subversiveness all his own. It seems almost pantomimic to modern eyes, but Kennedy was a product of simpler times. And more complex. His was an act predicated upon repression; naughtiness loses its point in a world without taboos, where anything goes. It wouldn't work today, when people don't just say \"fuck\" on television, they do it.\"<ref name=\"gressor\">[http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/04/25/1050777394925.html \"King of comedy, fears of a clown\"]: Megan Gressor, ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]'', 26 April 2003</ref>\n\n====Advertisements====\nDrawing on his radio experience with Nicky (who had routinely \"sent up\" advertisers), Kennedy transformed the live commercials from what would have otherwise been dull pro-forma obligations into a unique comedic art form. On one famous occasion, a scheduled 20-second ad spot for an aspirin product was spun out into 33 minutes of improvised comedy.\n\nNewton has written:\n\n<blockquote>\nThe blood would drain from the face of [[Pelaco]] shirt-wearing executives in television, advertising and business until they realised that instead of televisual suicide, this skinny little wiseguy was commercial gold. And then they liked his brand of humour a lot.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\nA commercial I shared with Graham, Raoul Merton ('of comfort you're certain when you wear Raoul Merton') changed the footwear buying habits of men.<ref>Newton, Bert (1977). Op Cit, p. 91</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n===Sam Chisholm===\n[[Gerald Stone]] recounts in his book ''Compulsive Viewing'' that a \"cocky young salesman\" visited the IMT set hoping for an extra plug for his employer's product. The young salesman was [[Sam Chisholm]], who later became a senior executive for variously the [[Kerry Packer|Packer]] and [[Rupert Murdoch|Murdoch]] media empires. A May 2005 interview with Chisholm records:<ref name=\"ninemsn_chisolm_2005\">{{cite web |url=http://www.sunday.ninemsn.com.au/sunday/cover_stories/transcript_1864.asp |title=50 years of television, Part two (transcript)|publisher=NineMSN |work=Sunday |author=Davis, Graham|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060827002708/http://www.sunday.ninemsn.com.au/sunday/cover_stories/transcript_1864.asp |archivedate=27 August 2006}}</ref>\n\n:Sam Chisholm: ''I was working for Johnson's wax at the time, and I don't think he believed my ...''\n:Graham Davis: ''Sales pitch.''\n:Sam Chisholm: ''Assertions about this product. So I said, \"I'll go and polish your floors and prove it to you.\" Which I did.''\n:Graham Davis: ''Over at his home?''\n:Sam Chisholm: ''Absolutely.''\n:Graham Davis: ''You got down on your hands and knees at his home?''\n:Sam Chisholm: ''Yep. I started off as his housekeeper and ended up being his boss.''\n\n===Rover===\nKennedy requested a \"reject\" dog from the [[Jack Davey]] Memorial Guide Dog Centre and was given a [[Labrador Retriever]] which he named \"Rover\".\n\nRover was sometimes brought into the studio to assist with advertisements for Pal dog food. One night the dog showed no interest whatsoever in the product, which Kennedy then himself proceeded to eat with apparent relish, straight from the can \u2013 or so it seemed.\n\nRover also achieved television immortality by relieving himself \u2013 live to air \u2013 upon one of the huge cameras. The studio audience collapsed in hysterics, but the duration and urgency of Rover's impressively hydraulic performance might have led some cynics to question just how impromptu the event really was.\n\nBiographer Blundell quotes Ernie Carroll:\n\n<blockquote>\nPal dog food, with Rover [...] was time consuming [...] once we fed him all afternoon so that when he came out to do the commercial he didn't want to touch the Pal dog food. He was already full of it. [...] on another occasion they had him drink before the show, big drinks. So when he came out, he peed all over the camera and all around the set [...] Even those seemingly innocent dog manoeuvres were carefully planned.\n</blockquote>\n\nKennedy was exasperated for decades by questions about ''\"whatever happened to Rover\"''. As late as 1989, on ''Graham Kennedy's News Hour'' (see below), he answered a viewer's question couched in exactly those words with the withering reply ''\"... he was a dog. What do you think happened?\"''\n\nIn early June 2005, on the [[3AW]] program ''Nightline'' with Philip Brady and [[Bruce Mansfield]], Patti (McGrath) Newton stated that her father had often looked after Rover when he appeared at GTV-9. It seems that Kennedy had become increasingly irritated with retrieving Rover from the pound and so, when Patti's father's dog died, Rover went on to a long and happy life at the McGrath (senior) household.\n\n===''The Graham Kennedy Show''===\n{{main|The Graham Kennedy Show}}\nAfter specials on 15 November 1971 and 2 March 1972, Kennedy returned to regular television with ''[[The Graham Kennedy Show]]'' on 19 September 1972. This series lasted until late 1973. In 1974, when Kennedy claimed he wanted a rest, Nine allegedly paid him not to sign with another network. It was [[Frank Packer]] who paid Kennedy $50,000 to do nothing, as he was fearful he would work for someone else. Kennedy said in 1978:\n\n:It wasn't a retainer. It was $50,000 not to work. Sir Frank didn't know it but I had no intention of working.<ref>[[TV Week]] magazine, 11 March 1978 \u2013 \"Graham Hasn't Conquered Those Jitters\" by Ben Mitchell pp58-59</ref>\n\nThe Graham Kennedy Show resumed in March 1975, and was Kennedy's first series in colour.\n\nMemorable, and controversial, moments, included the \"crow call\" controversy where, on 3 March 1975, Kennedy imitated a crow call (\"faaaaaark\") highly reminiscent of the word \"[[fuck]]\". This led the [[Australian Broadcasting Control Board]] to request that Kennedy \"show cause\" why he should not be removed from the airwaves.<ref>{{cite news|title=Kennedy faces a total ban on TV|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=XVoQAAAAIBAJ&sjid=OpIDAAAAIBAJ&pg=3156%2C949082|accessdate=23 December 2014|work=The Age (Melbourne)|date=1975-03-05|ref=46}}</ref> Kennedy replied that he could not show cause,<ref>{{cite news|title=Kennedy case to be heard on Tuesday|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=N_xjAAAAIBAJ&sjid=m-YDAAAAIBAJ&pg=904%2C3520849|accessdate=23 December 2014|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=1975-03-12|ref=47}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Order to Kennedy producer - threat to two TV shows|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=MvxjAAAAIBAJ&sjid=m-YDAAAAIBAJ&pg=3160%2C1897513|accessdate=23 December 2014|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=1975-03-07|ref=48}}</ref> suggesting that the Board take action to limit his appearances, while hinting at legal action should they do so.<ref>{{cite news|title=Court threat by Kennedy|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=NvxjAAAAIBAJ&sjid=m-YDAAAAIBAJ&pg=5757%2C3373285|accessdate=23 December 2014|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=1975-03-11|ref=49}}</ref> Rather than removing him, the ABCB banned Kennedy from appearing live, forcing him to pre-record the show on videotape.<ref>{{cite news|title=TV and radio ban on 'live' Kennedy|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=PvxjAAAAIBAJ&sjid=m-YDAAAAIBAJ&pg=3781%2C4968719|accessdate=23 December 2014|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=1975-03-19|ref=50}}</ref>\n\nAnother notable moment was from 17 April 1975, when Kennedy attacked Senator [[Doug McClelland]], the then Minister for the Media, over local content issues. His comments were edited, and a voiceover recorded by the general manager was inserted saying that Kennedy had made a \"cowardly attack on a Labor Minister who was unable to defend himself.\"\n\nFollowing the McClelland incident, Kennedy parted company with the Nine Network, but later returned.\n\n===''Power Without Glory''===\nKennedy appeared as Clive Parker in an episode of the 26-part ABC drama ''[[Power Without Glory]]'', which began on 21 June 1976.\n\n===''Blankety Blanks''===\nHe returned to television in 1977 for what is now [[Network Ten]] to host a comedy game show, ''[[Blankety Blanks (Australian game show)|Blankety Blanks]]''. It dominated early evening television over two seasons, between 7 February 1977 and 15 September 1978. The show featured friends from his earlier days including [[Noeline Brown]], [[Barry Creyton]], [[Noel Ferrier]], [[Ugly Dave Gray]], [[Carol Raye]] and [[Stuart Wagstaff]]. It was only after the show became a ratings success and the network's most profitable program that it revealed Kennedy was paid an unprecedented $1 million per season.<ref>{{cite book|title=Graham Kennedy Treasures: Friends Remember the King|page=49|author=Mike McColl-Jones|publisher=Miegunyah Press|year=2008|isbn=0522855458}}</ref>\n\nIn 1979, \"The King\" became ''[[Moomba|King of Moomba]]'' complete with his famous motorised desk, the second Melbourne-born recipient after [[Bert Newton|Newton]].<ref>Craig Bellamy, Gordon Chisholm, Hilary Eriksen (17 February 2006).

Retrieved 29 June 2008.</ref>\n\n===''Graham Kennedy's News Show''===\n\nNearly 60, Kennedy accepted an offer from the Nine Network's managing director Sam Chisholm to present ''[[Graham Kennedy's News Show]]'' from Sydney, to air five nights a week at 10:30&nbsp;pm against Clive Robertson's ''Newsworld'' on the Seven Network.<ref>Blundell (2003), pp. 369\u2013372</ref> Five trial programs were recorded but never broadcast.<ref>Blundell (2003), p. 373</ref>\n\nKennedy initially \"pulled the plug\" and withdrew from the show but returned (see Harry M. Miller, below). Kennedy's contract stipulated that his co-presenter would be sports commentator [[Ken Sutcliffe]].<ref>Blundell (2003), p. 371</ref>\n\nKennedy's writers, who worked from a production cottage at the corner of Scott Street and Artarmon Road included Jim Pike, Tim Evans, Larry Burns, and Ken Stirling. Blundell records:\n\n<blockquote>\nThey worked in the back room shooting out gags over typewriters and word processors, united in their hatred of the 'Little Guy', as they also called him.\"<ref>Blundell (2003), p. 382</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nThe writers also referred to Kennedy as \"the little buggle-eyed bastard\",.<ref name=\"Blundell 2003, p. 383\">Blundell (2003), p. 383</ref> However, they admired his talent. Jim Pike said, \".. I hate him, but he is the best there is\".<ref name=\"Blundell 2003, p. 383\"/>\n\nKennedy defied convention with remarks which were tasteless, and yet hilarious. Pointing out the irony of how a news show gets good ratings he said it would be helpful for his show's ratings if the Pope's aircraft were to fly into a mountain while it was full of orphans.  He also remarked that Queen Elizabeth II \"didn't have bad breasts ... for a woman of her age\" and mocked 17 October 1989, San Francisco Loma Prieta earthquake with a re-creation on the set.\n\nAfter a slightly heavy woman was caught for streaking at a cricket match, Graham explained on air that they would run the footage but had to cover certain offending parts of her body with black.  The clip he played was all black, except for a single spot that revealed her pubic hair.\n\nHe also reprised the \"Chum Song\" from Melbourne radio days, saying that it originated in a 1920s children's newspaper column in Scotland. In Nancy Lee's book ''Being a Chum Was Fun'' she writes:<ref>Lee, Nancy (1979). Op Cit, p.67</ref>\n\n<blockquote>The Chum Song, I believe, was written and recorded in Glasgow in 1930 by Jack Hylton's orchestra for a Scottish Newsboys Club. The recording Kennedy used to close the program was provided by Melbourne music Historian Alex Hehr </blockquote>\n\nThe lyrics of the chorus are:\n\n<blockquote>\n:''Being a chum is fun,''\n:''That is why I'm one;''\n:''Always smiling, always gay,''\n:''Chummy at work,''\n:''(and) chummy at play -''\n:''Laugh away your worries,''\n:''Don't be sad or glum;''\n:''And everyone will know that you're a ''\n:''Chum, chum, chum!''\n</blockquote>\n\nSutcliffe would \"corpse\", with tears in his eyes, unable to continue; this became so frequent that Kennedy managed to coin a catchphrase, \"I love it when he cries\".\n\nKennedy called Sutcliffe \"Two Dogs\" after delivering a joke ending with the tag \"Why do you ask,  Two Dogs Rooting?\"\n\nGraham Kennedy's News Show was a rarity in that it was a live news show that had a studio audience.  Five nights a week for most of the year, audiences lined up at 10:30 at night just to see Kennedy do his magic in the flesh.  Often the funniest parts of the show were in the commercial breaks when Kennedy would come down and join the audience for a chat.  He always made a point of telling them a particularly crude joke that was timed so they got the punchline just a second before the show was back on air.\n\n===''Coast to Coast''===\nOn 13 February 1989 the show became ''Coast to Coast'', with Nine journalist John Mangos replacing Sutcliffe, and ran until 8 December 1989.\n\n===Harry M. Miller===\nKennedy engaged [[Harry M. Miller]] as his agent. According to biographer Blundell, Kennedy believed that Miller was to donate his commission of $2500 per week to the [[Wayside Chapel]] for Kennedy's appearance on ''Graham Kennedy's News Show''.<ref>Blundell (2003), p. 374</ref>\n\nMiller later sued Kennedy for ''\"wrongful termination and for a 20 per cent commission on his 1989 gross earnings.\"''<ref>Blundell (2003), p. 387</ref> During the court case Miller ''\"painted a picture of his client of twenty years as a late-night drunk in the habit of sending demanding faxes while under the influence.\"''<ref>Blundell (2003), p. 388</ref> Justice Brownie found against Miller, and ordered him to pay $75,699 and costs.\n\n===''Graham Kennedy's Funniest Home Videos''===\nKennedy's last series was ''[[Australia's Funniest Home Video Show|Graham Kennedy's Funniest Home Video Show]]'' which was broadcast between 29 March and 15 November 1990 on the Nine Network.\n\n===''35 Years of Television''===\nKennedy presented the introduction segment to the [[Nine Network]] special ''35 Years of Television'' in 1991. The segment covered the very early days of television variety, including his own ''In Melbourne Tonight''.\n\n===Last television appearance===\nKennedy's last television appearance was in February 1994 in an interview for ''Ray Martin Presents Graham Kennedy's Sixtieth''. Believing that [[Ray Martin (television presenter)|Martin]] had ambushed him by departing from a pre-agreed list of questions, Kennedy ensured that much of the interview was unusable for broadcast by peppering his responses with obscenities.\n\nIn 2005 John Mangos wrote:\n<blockquote>He (Kennedy) later explained the experience in a piece for [[TV Week]] in an article called 'In his own words'.\n\n\"Ray Martin and I had worked together before, and he well knows that if I have the questions in advance, he'll get a better interview. Everyone knows this \u2013 politicians in particular. Ray duly faxed the questions to me, but on the morning of the recording changed them. I was bewildered by this (I think a researcher let him down). I terminated the interview when I didn't know what he was talking about and went upstairs to lunch.\"\n\nIt was a critical turning point in his career. He vowed never to do television again.<ref name=\"Mangos\"/></blockquote>\n\nRay Martin denied any ill intent, saying \"We faxed a series of general topics, but it was clear at the outset that much would depend on the general run of the interview [...] An ambush was not on the agenda [...] He had no complaints. There was never a suggestion that he was unhappy.\"<ref>Blundell (2003), pps. 409, 410</ref>\n\n===Logie awards===\nKennedy coined the name [[Logie Award]] in 1960, after the inventor of television, [[John Logie Baird]].\n\nKennedy received many Logies, including:\n\n* 5 [[Gold Logie Award for Most Popular Personality on Australian Television|Gold Logie]]s for the Most Popular Personality on Australian Television (1960, 1967, 1969, 1974, and 1978).\n**He also won the \"TV Week Awards' Star of the Year\" award at the inaugural presentation in 1959, and this is sometimes counted as his first Gold Logie, which would give him 6 in total\n* a Special Logie Award \u2013 the ''Star of the Decade'' in 1967\n* a [[List of Logie Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]] Logie Award in 1998. He did not attend the ceremony; the award was accepted on his behalf by Bert Newton.\n\n==Film career==\nKennedy appeared in a number of films, ranging from brief cameos to leading roles. They include:\n\n* ''[[On the Beach (1959 film)|On the Beach]]'' (1959) as Minor Role (uncredited)\n* ''[[They're a Weird Mob (film)|They're a Weird Mob]]'' (1966) as Himself (cameo)\n* ''[[The Box (soap opera)|The Box]]'' (1975, supporting role) as Himself\n* ''[[Don's Party]]'' (1976) as Mack / design engineer\n* ''[[The Odd Angry Shot]]'' (1979) as Harry\n* ''[[The Club (1980 film)|The Club]]'' (1980) as Ted Parker\n* ''[[Silent Reach]]'' (1983, TV Mini-Series) as Chasser Fitzpatrick\n* ''[[The Return of Captain Invincible]]'' (1983) as Prime Minister (cameo)\n* ''[[The Killing Fields (film)|The Killing Fields]]'' (1984) as Dougal\n* ''[[Stanley (1984 film)|Stanley]]'' (1984) as Norm Norris\n* ''[[Les Patterson Saves the World]]'' (1987) as Brian Lannigan\n* ''[[Travelling North]]'' (1987) as Freddie (final film role)\n\nHe also had a cameo in ''[[On the Beach (1959 film)|On the Beach]]'' (1959) which was not used.<ref name=\"on_the_beach_cameo\">{{cite web | url=http://delarue.net/beach.htm | title=On The Beach |work=On the Beach| accessdate=3 June 2007}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\n<blockquote>Being a period of that era of the 1950s I think being gay must have been pretty harsh for Graham. I can imagine...everybody knew, nobody cared, but I think it was such a time when you didn't talk about issues that were personal, and I think that made him much more secretive and reclusive, and I think that was probably quite a tough thing for him... \u2014 Susan Gaye Anderson''<ref name=\"RealDVD\"/></blockquote>\n\nKennedy himself never publicly acknowledged that he was gay, but his homosexuality was considered an open secret within the Australian entertainment industry.\n\nIn the 1960s [[Bob Dyer]] described him as \"probably the loneliest young man in Australia.\"<ref>Blundell (2003), p. 164</ref>\n\nIn 1973 Melbourne newspapers reported that Kennedy was engaged to 28-year-old Australian singer [[Lana Cantrell]], who became a successful New York lawyer. Many years later, Kennedy wrote to a newspaper that a photographer, taking pictures of him and Cantrell leaving a restaurant together asked if he could \"hint at a romance\". The following Sunday a poster proclaimed \"Graham and Lana to wed\".<ref>Blundell (2003), p. 361.</ref> His former housekeeper, Devona Fox, in the 2009 television documentary ''[[The Real Graham Kennedy]]'', produced by Bob Phillips, one of the producers from Kennedy's breakthrough Channel 9 program ''[[In Melbourne Tonight]]'', is quoted as saying:\n\n<blockquote>Graham always told me right early on that he would never get married. He told me that his life was devastated when his parents split up, and he said straight out, \"Mrs Fox, I'll never get married\", so I never expected anything more of him than what did happen. Even when Lana Cantrell came into the scene I was puzzled and I did say to him why all this, and of course we all know it was good publicity. Lana came to the house and I had to go up, and have it all cleaned, ready for her and her party to come one Sunday night. And then on the Monday night, this great big announcement was going to be made that he was supposed to be engaged to Lana Cantrell.

He was [[diabetic]], and a heavy smoker and drinker. Throughout his illnesses, his friends Tony Sattler and Noeline Brown rallied to his aid.\n\nOn 18 December 2001 his housekeeper found him unconscious and dehydrated.

Having made millions for the Packer family interests, he believed that \"''the Packers will always look after me''\".\n\nAccording to [[Graeme Blundell]]'s biography, Tony Sattler:\n\n<blockquote>\n[...]spent several days ringing Kerry Packer's office [...] Nursing was going to cost $3000 a week. 'We could cope for several years but not longer''. [...] ''After three days Di Stone, Mr Packer's personal assistant, called Sattler back: 'Mr Packer has considered his plight.

He can't walk any more and gets around in a wheelchair as a result of the diabetes and the years of heavy smoking.</blockquote>\n\nActor Graeme Blundell, who had worked with Kennedy on the movie ''The Odd Angry Shot'', published a biography of Kennedy, ''King: The Life and Comedy of Graham Kennedy'' (MacMillan, 2003).

His wasted and frail, aching body could take no more. I paid a short and emotional visit. Still, the ashtray was by his bedside next to a radio tuned to ABC Radio National. I leaned over to kiss him on the forehead and he whispered, 'Don't get too close, it hurts'.<ref name=\"Mangos\"/>\n</blockquote>\n\nHe also wrote:\n\n<blockquote>\nI was often asked if he had cancer or AIDS. In fact at 67, he had diabetes, some rheumatism, the odd creaky joint, a healthy capacity to whinge and the usual symptoms connected with smoking and drinking. But by now the horses were gone and the dog had died. He was eating less and drinking more. One night, he fell down the stairs. He was discovered the next morning on the floor by his housekeeper. He was rushed to the local hospital where pneumonia in one lung was treated effectively and efficiently, a fracture near his hip was repaired and he was diagnosed with brain damage. We were to learn he had Korsakoff's syndrome (an alcohol-related condition) and we decided to keep it private.<ref name=\"Mangos\"/>\n</blockquote>\n\n[[Korsakoff's syndrome]] is a form of [[amnesia]] seen in chronic [[alcoholics]]; briefly stated, victims eat too little and drink too much.\n\n===Derryn Hinch controversy===\nAfter his death, controversial [[Melbourne]]-based [[3AW]] radio broadcaster [[Derryn Hinch]] alleged that Kennedy had died from an [[AIDS]]-related disease. This was strenuously denied by his friends and carers [[Noeline Brown]] and [[Tony Sattler]], and as a result Kennedy's biographer Graeme Blundell then published Kennedy's medical records, including a recent negative HIV test, to disprove this allegation. Hinch fought back saying he didn't say Kennedy had AIDS, but that he was homosexual, had symptoms similar to those of [[Kaposi's sarcoma]], and died of [[pneumonia]], thus implying Kennedy's death was AIDS-related.\n\n===Funeral===\nTony Sattler offered the [[Nine Network]] the right to televise the funeral but it declined, claiming it could not justify the cost of the outside broadcast. The [[Seven Network]] accepted, and gave coverage free of charge to the Nine Network. Hence, the one-hour funeral service was aired simultaneously across both Seven and Nine networks. \n\n[[Stuart Wagstaff]] presented the funeral, which was attended by many of Kennedy's friends, colleagues and associates on the morning of 31 May 2005 at a small community theatre in the town of [[Mittagong]]. At the end of the funeral Kennedy's coffin was carried by players from the [[St Kilda Football Club]], the [[Australian rules football]] team he supported. \n\nWagstaff's eulogy alluded to the claims made by Derryn Hinch about the cause of Kennedy's death:\n\n<blockquote>Delivering a eulogy for a close friend and for someone who was so much admired is never a happy occasion. Though I must confess I would be quite happy to deliver a eulogy for a certain media personality who's tried the second Kennedy assassination of our time... and failed.<ref>{{cite news\n |url=http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0%2C21985%2C15471683-662%2C00.html \n |title=Last laugh for the King of TV \n |work=Herald Sun \n |location=Australia \n |publisher=News.com.au \n |accessdate=26 January 2008 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080204074118/http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0%2C21985%2C15471683-662%2C00.html \n |archivedate=4 February 2008 \n |df=dmy-all \n}}</ref><ref>{{cite news\n |url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/People/Classic-variety-hour-farewell/2005/05/31/1117305621699.html |title=Classic variety hour farewell | accessdate=26 January 2008 | location=Melbourne |work=The Age| date=1 June 2005}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nKennedy had never explicitly stated that he was homosexual, but at his funeral his friends were at last free to make jokes in a friendly way.\n\n''[[The Age]]'' newspaper, on 26 June 2005, reported John Mangos as saying that he \"knew Kennedy wanted his ashes scattered at sea.

Gekko can't contact the other PJ masks while they are trapped so after PJ Robot convinces him that it is safe he goes to rescue them.\nMeanwhile, it has just dawned on Luna that Gekko isn't there and she decides to search for him. Catboy and Owlette try to contact Gekko to warn him, but inside the fortress no communication can get through. Gekko goes to help them but gets trapped too. Since their powers don't work the same way on the moon as they do on earth, Catboy uses his Super Cat Speed to break their prisons while Luna goes to earth to bring everyone to the moon. But unfortunately her Luna Wand let's her know that the PJ masks are escaping from the fortress. The PJ masks, in order to escape from Luna Girl, improvise since their powers don't work the same way there. And manage to get the Luna Wand away from Luna and get the harvest moon crystal out of the Luna Wand and turn it back into a Luna magnet. Then they take the harvest moon crystal back to earth, (where Gekko is ecstatic to be,) and put it in the PJ Vault. When Luna gets back to earth she vows to get the harvest moon crystal back, paving the way for a Moonstruck part 3. The PJ Masks and Gekko are glad to be back home after such a exciting mission. \n\n----\n''Vehicle'': HQ Rocketship and PJ Rovers.\n\n''Hero revelation'': Don't let fear control your life.

Gekko can't contact the other PJ masks while they are trapped so after PJ Robot convinces him that it is safe he goes to rescue them.\nMeanwhile, it has just dawned on Luna that Gekko isn't there and she decides to search for him. Catboy and Owlette try to contact Gekko to warn him, but inside the fortress no communication can get through. Gekko goes to help them but gets trapped too. Since their powers don't work the same way on the moon as they do on earth, Catboy uses his Super Cat Speed to break their prisons while Luna goes to earth to bring everyone to the moon. But unfortunately her Luna Wand let's her know that the PJ masks are escaping from the fortress. The PJ masks, in order to escape from Luna Girl, improvise since their powers don't work the same way there. And manage to get the Luna Wand away from Luna and get the harvest moon crystal out of the Luna Wand and turn it back into a Luna magnet. Then they take the harvest moon crystal back to earth, (where Gekko is ecstatic to be,) and put it in the PJ Vault. When Luna gets back to earth she vows to get the harvest moon crystal back, paving the way for a Moonstruck part 3. The PJ Masks and Gekko are glad to be back home after such a exciting mission. \n\n----\n''Vehicle'': HQ Rocketship and PJ Rovers.\n\n''Hero revelation'': Don't let fear control your life.
