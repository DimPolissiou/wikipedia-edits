All this makes business history distinct from economic history, although they are clearly allied [...].\n}}</ref> It is distinct from \"company history\" which refers to [[official history|official histories]], usually funded by the company itself.\n\n==United States==\n{{main article|American business history}}\n\n===Robber baron debate===\n{{main article|Robber baron (industrialist)}}\nEven before academic studies began, Americans were enthralled by the [[Robber baron (industrialist)|Robber baron debate]]. As the United States industrialized very rapidly after the Civil War, a few hundred prominent men made large fortunes by building and controlling major industries, such as railroads, shipping, steel, mining and banking. Yet the newer who gathered the most attention was railroader [[Cornelius Vanderbilt]]. Historian Stephen Frazier argues that probably most Americans admired Vanderbilt; they agreed with biographer William Augustus Croffut who wrote in 1886:\n:It is now known that the desire to own property is the chief difference between the Savage and the enlightened man; that aggregations of money in the hands of individuals are in inestimable blessing to Society, for without them there could be no public improvements or private enterprises, no railroads or steamships,  or telegraphs; no cities, the leisure class, no schools, colleges, literature, art \u2013 in short, no civilization. The one man to whom the community owes most is the capitalist, that the menu gives, but the man who saves and invests, so that his property reproduces and multiplies itself instead of being consumed.<ref>{{cite book|author=William Augustus Croffut|title=The Vanderbilts and the Story of Their Fortune|publisher=Belford, Clarke|url=https://archive.org/details/vanderbiltsands02crofgoog|year=1886|page=[https://archive.org/details/vanderbiltsands02crofgoog/page/n319 275]}}</ref>\nHowever, Fraser goes on, there was a minority who vehemently dissented:\n:A minority were irate and excoriated the titans of finance and industry as 'robber barons' and worse. [[E.L. Godkin]], founder of ''[[The Nation]]'', launched a volley of invective at the new plutocracy: 'kings of the street' like Vanderbilt displayed 'unmitigated and immitigable selfishness' as appalling as their 'audacity, push, unscrupulousness and brazen disregard of others' rights'.<ref>Steve Fraser, [http://www.thenation.com/article/misunderstood-robber-baron-cornelius-vanderbilt/ \"The Misunderstood Robber Baron: On Cornelius Vanderbilt: T.J. Stiles's The First Tycoon is a gilded portrait of the robber baron Cornelius Vanderbilt\", '' The Nation'' Nov. 11, 2009]</ref>\n \nBy the Great Depression of the 1930s, Fraser continues:\n:Biographies of Mellon, Carnegie and Rockefeller were often laced with moral censure, warning that 'tories of industry' were a threat to democracy and that parasitism, aristocratic pretension and tyranny have always trailed in the wake of concentrated wealth, whether accumulated dynastically or more impersonally by the faceless corporation. This scholarship, and the cultural persuasion of which it was an expression, drew on a deeply rooted sensibility\u2013partly religious, partly egalitarian and democratic\u2013that stretched back to William Jennings Bryan, Andrew Jackson and Tom Paine.<ref>Fraser, \"The Misunderstood Robber Baron\"</ref>\n\nHowever a counterattack by academic historians began as the Depression ended. Business historian [[Allan Nevins]] challenged this view of big businessmen by advocating the \"Industrial Statesman\" thesis.  Nevins, in his ''John D. Rockefeller: The Heroic Age of American Enterprise'' (2 vols., 1940), took on Josephson.  He argued that while Rockefeller may have engaged in some unethical and illegal business practices, this should not overshadow his bringing order to industrial chaos of the day. [[Gilded Age]] capitalists, according to Nevins, sought to impose order and stability on competitive business, and that their work made the United States the foremost economy by the 20th century.<ref>Allan Nevins, ''John D. Rockefeller: The Heroic Age of American Enterprise'' (2 vols., 1940).</ref>  Business journalist [[Ferdinand Lundberg]] later criticized Nevins for confusing readers.<ref>Ferdinand Lundberg. ''The Rockefeller Syndrome''. New York: Lyle Stuart, 1975. p. 145.</ref> By contrast, historian Priscilla Roberts argues that Nevins' studies of inventors and businessmen brought about a reassessment of American industrialization and its leaders. She writes: \n:Nevins argued that economic development in the United States caused relatively little human suffering, while raising the general standard of living and making the United States the great industrial power capable of defeating Germany in both world wars. The great capitalists of that period should, he argued, be viewed, not as 'robber barons', but as men whose economic self-interest  had played an essentially positive role in American history, and who had done nothing criminal by the standards of their time.<ref>Priscilla M. Roberts, \"Nevins, Allan\" in {{cite book|author=Kelly Boyd, ed.|title=Encyclopedia of Historians and Historical Writing, vol. 2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0121vD9STIMC&pg=PA869|year=1999|publisher=Taylor & Francis|page=869|isbn=9781884964336}}</ref>\n\nHistorians have followed Nevins' lead in writing biographies of the major industrialists of the [[Gilded Age]]. These include:\n* [[David Cannadine]], ''[[Mellon: An American Life]]'' ([[New York City|New York]]: [[Alfred A. Knopf]], 2006)\n* [[Ron Chernow]], ''[[The House of Morgan: An American Banking Dynasty and the Rise of Modern Finance]]'' ([[New York City|New York]]: [[Atlantic Monthly Press]], 1990)\n* [[Ron Chernow]], ''Titan: The Life of John D. Rockefeller, Sr.'' ([[New York City|New York]]: [[Random House]], 2007)\n* George Harvey, ''Henry Clay Frick: The Man'' ([[Washington, D.C.]]: Beard Books, 2002)\n* [[David Nasaw]], ''[[Andrew Carnegie]]'' ([[New York City|New York]]: [[Penguin Press]], 2006)\n* [[T.J. Stiles]], ''[[The First Tycoon: The Epic Life of Cornelius Vanderbilt]]'' ([[New York City|New York]]: [[Alfred A. Knopf]], 2009)\n* [[Jean Strouse]], ''Morgan: American Financier'' ([[New York City|New York]]: [[Random House]], 1999)\nThough these later biographers did not confer heroic status on their subjects, they used historical and biographical investigations to establish a more complex understanding of the American past, and the history of American economic development in particular.\n\nIn 1958 historian Hal Bridges finds that \"The most vehement and persistent controversy in business history has been that waged by the critics and defenders of the 'robber baron' concept of the American businessman.\"<ref>Hal Bridges, \"The Robber Baron Concept in American History\", ''Business History Review'' (1958) 32#1 pp.&nbsp;1\u201313 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3111897 in JSTOR]</ref>  In terms of the Robber Baron model, by the end of the 20th century scholars had mostly discarded it although it remained influential in the popular culture. [[Richard White (historian)|Richard White]], historian of the transcontinental railroads, stated in 2011 he has no use for the concept, because it had been killed off by historians [[Robert H. Wiebe]] and [[Alfred D. Chandler, Jr.|Alfred Chandler]]. He notes that \"Much of the modern history of corporations is a reaction against the Robber Barons and fictions.\"<ref>Richard White, ''Railroaded: The Transcontinentals and the Making of Modern America'' (2011) pp. xxxi, 234, 508.</ref>\n\n===Academic studies===\nMeanwhile, business history as an academic discipline was founded by Professor [[N. S. B. Gras]] at the [[Harvard University Graduate School of Business Administration]], starting in 1927. He defined the field's subject matter and approach, wrote the first general treatise in the field, and helped [[Harvard]] build a tradition of scholarship as well as the leading library in the field. He edited a series of monographs, the Harvard Studies in Business History. He also served as editor of the ''Bulletin of the Business Historical Society'' (1926\u20131953), a journal which later became the ''[[Business History Review]]'' (1954-date).   N.S.B. Grass and Henrietta M. Larson, ''Casebook in American business history'' (1939) defined the field for a generation.<ref>See  N.S.B. Grass and Henrietta M. Larson, ''Casebook in American business history'' (1939)</ref>\n\nBusiness history in the U.S. took off in the 1960s with a high volume of product and innovative methodologies. Scholars worked to develop theoretical explanations of the growth of business enterprise, the study of strategy and structure by Alfred Chandler being a prime example. The relationship between business and the federal government became a focal point of study. On the whole, the 1960s affirmed the conclusions of the earlier decades regarding the close interrelationship between government and business enterprise.\n===Ranking entrepreneurs and management theorists===\nA 2002 survey of 58 business history professors gave the top spots in American business history to  [[Henry Ford]], followed by [[Bill Gates]]; [[John D. Rockefeller]]; [[Andrew Carnegie]], and [[Thomas Edison]].  They were followed by [[Sam Walton]]; [[J. P. Morgan]]; [[Alfred P. Sloan]]; [[Walt Disney]]; [[Ray Kroc]]; [[Thomas J.

Chandler]] (1918-2007) at the [[Harvard Business School]].  In a career that spanned over sixty years, Chandler produced numerous groundbreaking monographs, articles, and reviews. Intensely focused on only a few areas of the discipline, Chandler nonetheless succeeded in establishing and developing an entirely new realm of business history.<ref>Richard R. John, \"Elaborations, Revisions, Dissents: Alfred D. Chandler Jr.'s The Visible Hand after Twenty Years,\" ''Business History Review'' (1997) 7#1 pp 151-200 [http://www-personal.umich.edu/~twod/oil/NEW_SCHOOL_COURSE2005/articles/research-oil/research-oil/john_chandlers_visible_hand_20_yrs_after_bus-hst-revw_1997.pdf online]</ref><ref>Richard R.

Chandler, Jr. and the Landscape of Marketing History.\" ''Journal of Macromarketing'' 20#2 (2000): 167-173.</ref>\n\nChandler's masterwork was ''The Visible Hand: The Managerial Revolution in American Business'' (1977). His first two chapters looked at traditional owner-operated small business operations in commerce and production, including the largest among them, the slave plantations in the South. Chapters 3-5 summarize the history of railroad management, with stress on innovations not just in technology but also in accounting, finance and statistics. He then turned to the new business operations made possible by the rail system in mass distribution, such as jobbers, department stores and mail order. A quick survey (ch 8) review mass innovation in mass production. The integration of mass distribution and mass production (ch 9-11) led to many mergers and the emergence of giant industrial corporations by 1900.  Management for Chandler was much more than the CEO, it was the whole system of techniques and included middle management (ch 11) as well as the corporate structure of the biggest firms, Standard Oil, General Electric, US Steel, and DuPont (ch 13-14).  Chandler argued that modern large-scale firms arose to take advantage of the national markets and productive techniques available after the rail network was in place. He found that they prospered because they had higher productivity, lower costs, and higher profits. The firms created the \"managerial class\" in America because they needed to coordinate the increasingly complex and interdependent system.  This ability to achieve efficiency through coordination, not some anti-competitive monopolistic greed by robber barons, explained the high levels of concentration in modern American industry.<ref>Steven W. Usselman, \"Still Visible: Alfred D. Chandler's The Visible Hand,\" ''Technology and Culture'' vol 47 #3 (2006) 584-596</ref>\n\nChandler's work was somewhat ignored in history departments, but proved influential in business, economics, and sociology departments.<ref>Thomas K. McCraw, \"Alfred Chandler: His Vision and Achievement,\" ''Business History Review,'' Summer 2008, Vol. 82 Issue 2, pp 207-226</ref>  In sociology, for example, prior to Chandler's research, sociologists assumed there were no differences between governmental, corporate, and nonprofit organizations. Chandler's focus on corporations clearly demonstrated that there were differences, and this thesis has guided organizational sociologists' work since the 1970s. It also motivated sociologists to investigate and critique Chandler's work more closely, turning up instances in which Chandler assumed American corporations acted for reasons of efficiency when they actually operated in a context of politics or conflict.<ref>[[Neil Fligstein]], \"Chandler and the Sociology of Organizations,\" ''Business History Review,'' Summer 2008, Vol. 82 Issue 2, pp 241-250</ref> Other historians, such as [[Gabriel Kolko]], challenged the very notion of \"efficiency through coordination\", arguing instead that [[big business]] had, for reasons of inefficiency and a dislike of market discipline, openly sought government assistance to keep market forces at bay.\n\n===Other mechanisms===\nLamoreaux ''et al.'' (2003) offers a new synthesis of American business history during the 19th-20th centuries. Moving beyond the markets-versus-hierarchies framework that underlies the previously dominant interpretation of Chandler, the authors highlight the great variety of coordination mechanisms in use in the economy at any given time. Drawing on late-20th-century theoretical work in economics, they show how the relative advantages and disadvantages of these different mechanisms have shifted in complex and often unpredictable ways as a result of changing economic circumstances. One advantage of this perspective is that it avoids the teleology that has characterized so much writing in the field. As a result, the authors can situate the \"New Economy\" of the late 20th century in broad historical context without succumbing to the temptation to view it as a climactic stage in the process of economic development. They thus provide a particularly persuasive example of the importance of business history to the understanding of national and international history.<ref>Naomi R. Lamoreaux et al, \"Beyond Markets and Hierarchies: Toward a New Synthesis of American Business History.\" ''American Historical Review'' 2003 108(2): 404-433.</ref>\n\n===Comparative===\nUnderstanding the development of business history as a discipline meriting its own aims, theories and methods is often understood as a transition from dominating themes of 'company biography', toward more analytical 'comparative' approaches. This 'comparative' trend enabled practitioners to underline their work with 'generalist' potential. Questions of comparative business performance have become a staple, featuring into the wider economic histories of nations, regions and communities. For many this transition was first achieved by [[Alfred D. Chandler]]. Chandler\u2019s successors as Isidor Straus Professor of Business History at [[Harvard Business School]] continued to emphasize the importance of comparative research and course development. In 1995 [[Thomas K. McCraw]] published ''Creating Modern Capitalism'' (Cambridge, MA 1995) <ref name=\"McCraw1995\">{{cite book|author1=Thomas K.

They argued that the economic development in this period stemmed from various phenomena of the late 19th century: the corporation system, the joint-stock deposit and investment banks, and the technological innovations in the steel industry. To clarify the contributions of 19th-century entrepreneurs to the economic development in France, French scholars support two journals, '' Enterprises et Histoire'' and ''Revue d'Histoire de la Siderurgie.''<ref>Youssef Cassis, \"Business History in France\" in Franco Amatori and Geoffrey Jones, eds.

Latin American business history developed in the 1960s, but until the 1980s it was dominated by either highly politicized debates over Latin American underdevelopment or biographies of Latin American entrepreneurs. Since the 1980s, Latin American business history has become a much more professionalized and an integrated part of Latin American academia. It is much less politicized and has moved beyond entrepreneurial biography to histories of companies and industries. However, Latin American business historians have still not devoted enough attention to agricultural enterprises or comparative histories between the many countries. Probably most importantly, Latin American business historians have to become much more versed in business history theory and methodology so as to get beyond mere summation of the region's economic past.<ref>Mar\u00eda In\u00e9s Barbero,  \"Business History in Latin America: A Historiographical Perspective,\" ''Business History Review,'' (2008) 82#3, pp 555-575</ref><ref>Carlos, Marichal, \"Archival Note: Banking History and Archives in Latin America,\" ''Business History Review,'' (2008) 82#3 pp 585-602</ref>\n\nIn the 1980s, numerous governments in Latin America adopted neoliberal policies.<ref>Gerardo Otero, \"The neoliberal food regime in Latin America: state, agribusiness transnational corporations and biotechnology.\" ''Canadian Journal of Development Studies/Revue canadienne d'\u00e9tudes du d\u00e9veloppement'' 33.3 (2012): 282-294 .</ref><ref> Ben Ross Schneider, \"The material bases of technocracy: Investor confidence and neoliberalism in Latin America.\" in ''The politics of expertise in Latin America'' edited by Miguel A.

The most influential of these early company histories was [[Charles Wilson (historian)]]\u2019s ''History of Unilever'', the first volume of which was published in 1954. Other examples included Coleman\u2019s work on Courtaulds and artificial fibres, Alford on Wills and the tobacco industry, Barker on Pilkington\u2019s and glass manufacture.<ref>John Wilson, and Steven Toms, J.S \u2018Fifty years of Business History\u2019, ''Business History'' (2008) 50#2 pp.125-26</ref><ref>. Leslie Hannah, \u2018New Issues in British Business History\u2019, ''Business History Review'' (1983) 57# 2, pp.165-174.</ref>  These early studies were conducted by primarily by economic historians interested in the role of leading firms in the development of the wider industry, and therefore went beyond mere corporate histories. Although some work examined the successful industries of the industrial revolution and the role of the key entrepreneurs, in the 1970s scholarly debate in British business history became increasingly focused on economic decline. For economic historians, the loss of British competitive advantage after 1870 could at least in part be explained by entrepreneurial failure, prompting further business history research into individual industry and corporate cases. The Lancashire cotton textile industry, which had been the leading take-off sector in the industrial revolution, but which was slow to invest in subsequent technical developments, became an important topic of debate on this subject. [[William Lazonick]] for example argued that cotton textile entrepreneurs in Britain failed to develop larger integrated plants on the American model; a conclusion similar to Chandler\u2019s synthesis of a number of comparative case studies.<ref>Chandler, A., Scale and Scope: The Dynamics of Industrial Capitalism, Cambridge Mass.: Belknap Press (1990).</ref><ref>William Mass, & William Lazonick, \"The British Cotton Industry and International Competitive Advantage: the state of the debates,\" ''Business History,'' (1990) 32#4 pp. 9-65.</ref>\n\nStudies of British business leaders have emphasized how they fit into the class structure, especially their relationship to the aristocracy, and the desire to use their wealth to purchase landed estates, and hereditary titles.<ref>Howard L.

Jeremy, ed., ''Dictionary of business biography: a biographical dictionary of business leaders active in Britain in the period 1860-1980'' (Butterworths, 1984).</ref>\nBritish business history began to widen its scope in the 1980s, with research work conducted at the LSE's Business History Unit, led first by Leslie Hannah, then by Terry Gourvish. Other research centres followed, notably at Glasgow and Reading, reflecting an increasing involvement in the discipline by Business and Management School academics. More recent editors of ''Business History'', [[Geoffrey Jones (academic)]] (Harvard Business School), Charles Harvey (University of Newcastle Business School), John Wilson (Liverpool University Management School) and Steven Toms (Leeds University Business School) have promoted management strategy themes such as networks, family capitalism, corporate governance, human resource management, marketing and brands, and multi-national organisations in their international as well as merely British context. Employing these new themes has allowed business historians to challenge and adapt the earlier conclusions of Chandler and others about the performance of the British economy.<ref>Toms, Steven and Wilson, John F. \"Scale, Scope and Accountability: Towards a New Paradigm of British Business History,\" ''Business History'' (2003) 45#4 pp 1-23.</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n<references/>\n\n==Bibliography==\n<!-- Commented out: [[File:The Accidental Billionaires.jpg|230px|thumb|Right|Business history in the popular media focuses on intrigue and corruption]] -->\n\n===Textbooks and surveys: USA===\n* Blackford, Mansel G.

All this makes business history distinct from economic history, although they are clearly allied [...].\n}}</ref> It is distinct from \"company history\" which refers to [[official history|official histories]], usually funded by the company itself.\n\n==United States==\n{{main article|American business history}}\n\n===Robber baron debate===\n{{main article|Robber baron (industrialist)}}\nEven before academic studies began, Americans were enthralled by the [[Robber baron (industrialist)|Robber baron debate]]. As the United States industrialized very rapidly after the Civil War, a few hundred prominent men made large fortunes by building and controlling major industries, such as railroads, shipping, steel, mining and banking. Yet the newer who gathered the most attention was railroader [[Cornelius Vanderbilt]]. Historian Stephen Frazier argues that probably most Americans admired Vanderbilt; they agreed with biographer William Augustus Croffut who wrote in 1886:\n:It is now known that the desire to own property is the chief difference between the Savage and the enlightened man; that aggregations of money in the hands of individuals are in inestimable blessing to Society, for without them there could be no public improvements or private enterprises, no railroads or steamships,  or telegraphs; no cities, the leisure class, no schools, colleges, literature, art \u2013 in short, no civilization. The one man to whom the community owes most is the capitalist, that the menu gives, but the man who saves and invests, so that his property reproduces and multiplies itself instead of being consumed.<ref>{{cite book|author=William Augustus Croffut|title=The Vanderbilts and the Story of Their Fortune|publisher=Belford, Clarke|url=https://archive.org/details/vanderbiltsands02crofgoog|year=1886|page=[https://archive.org/details/vanderbiltsands02crofgoog/page/n319 275]}}</ref>\nHowever, Fraser goes on, there was a minority who vehemently dissented:\n:A minority were irate and excoriated the titans of finance and industry as 'robber barons' and worse. [[E.L. Godkin]], founder of ''[[The Nation]]'', launched a volley of invective at the new plutocracy: 'kings of the street' like Vanderbilt displayed 'unmitigated and immitigable selfishness' as appalling as their 'audacity, push, unscrupulousness and brazen disregard of others' rights'.<ref>Steve Fraser, [http://www.thenation.com/article/misunderstood-robber-baron-cornelius-vanderbilt/ \"The Misunderstood Robber Baron: On Cornelius Vanderbilt: T.J. Stiles's The First Tycoon is a gilded portrait of the robber baron Cornelius Vanderbilt\", '' The Nation'' Nov. 11, 2009]</ref>\n \nBy the Great Depression of the 1930s, Fraser continues:\n:Biographies of Mellon, Carnegie and Rockefeller were often laced with moral censure, warning that 'tories of industry' were a threat to democracy and that parasitism, aristocratic pretension and tyranny have always trailed in the wake of concentrated wealth, whether accumulated dynastically or more impersonally by the faceless corporation. This scholarship, and the cultural persuasion of which it was an expression, drew on a deeply rooted sensibility\u2013partly religious, partly egalitarian and democratic\u2013that stretched back to William Jennings Bryan, Andrew Jackson and Tom Paine.<ref>Fraser, \"The Misunderstood Robber Baron\"</ref>\n\nHowever a counterattack by academic historians began as the Depression ended. Business historian [[Allan Nevins]] challenged this view of big businessmen by advocating the \"Industrial Statesman\" thesis.  Nevins, in his ''John D. Rockefeller: The Heroic Age of American Enterprise'' (2 vols., 1940), took on Josephson.  He argued that while Rockefeller may have engaged in some unethical and illegal business practices, this should not overshadow his bringing order to industrial chaos of the day. [[Gilded Age]] capitalists, according to Nevins, sought to impose order and stability on competitive business, and that their work made the United States the foremost economy by the 20th century.<ref>Allan Nevins, ''John D. Rockefeller: The Heroic Age of American Enterprise'' (2 vols., 1940).</ref>  Business journalist [[Ferdinand Lundberg]] later criticized Nevins for confusing readers.<ref>Ferdinand Lundberg. ''The Rockefeller Syndrome''. New York: Lyle Stuart, 1975. p. 145.</ref> By contrast, historian Priscilla Roberts argues that Nevins' studies of inventors and businessmen brought about a reassessment of American industrialization and its leaders. She writes: \n:Nevins argued that economic development in the United States caused relatively little human suffering, while raising the general standard of living and making the United States the great industrial power capable of defeating Germany in both world wars. The great capitalists of that period should, he argued, be viewed, not as 'robber barons', but as men whose economic self-interest  had played an essentially positive role in American history, and who had done nothing criminal by the standards of their time.<ref>Priscilla M. Roberts, \"Nevins, Allan\" in {{cite book|author=Kelly Boyd, ed.|title=Encyclopedia of Historians and Historical Writing, vol. 2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0121vD9STIMC&pg=PA869|year=1999|publisher=Taylor & Francis|page=869|isbn=9781884964336}}</ref>\n\nHistorians have followed Nevins' lead in writing biographies of the major industrialists of the [[Gilded Age]].

Knopf]], 2006)\n* [[Ron Chernow]], ''[[The House of Morgan: An American Banking Dynasty and the Rise of Modern Finance]]'' ([[New York City|New York]]: [[Atlantic Monthly Press]], 1990)\n* [[Ron Chernow]], ''Titan: The Life of John D.

[[Richard White (historian)|Richard White]], historian of the transcontinental railroads, stated in 2011 he has no use for the concept, because it had been killed off by historians [[Robert H. Wiebe]] and [[Alfred D. Chandler, Jr.|Alfred Chandler]]. He notes that \"Much of the modern history of corporations is a reaction against the Robber Barons and fictions.\"<ref>Richard White, ''Railroaded: The Transcontinentals and the Making of Modern America'' (2011) pp. xxxi, 234, 508.</ref>\n\n===Academic studies===\nMeanwhile, business history as an academic discipline was founded by Professor [[N. S. B. Gras]] at the [[Harvard University Graduate School of Business Administration]], starting in 1927. He defined the field's subject matter and approach, wrote the first general treatise in the field, and helped [[Harvard]] build a tradition of scholarship as well as the leading library in the field. He edited a series of monographs, the Harvard Studies in Business History. He also served as editor of the ''Bulletin of the Business Historical Society'' (1926\u20131953), a journal which later became the ''[[Business History Review]]'' (1954-date).   N.S.B. Grass and Henrietta M. Larson, ''Casebook in American business history'' (1939) defined the field for a generation.<ref>See  N.S.B. Grass and Henrietta M. Larson, ''Casebook in American business history'' (1939)</ref>\n\nBusiness history in the U.S. took off in the 1960s with a high volume of product and innovative methodologies. Scholars worked to develop theoretical explanations of the growth of business enterprise, the study of strategy and structure by Alfred Chandler being a prime example. The relationship between business and the federal government became a focal point of study. On the whole, the 1960s affirmed the conclusions of the earlier decades regarding the close interrelationship between government and business enterprise.\n===Ranking entrepreneurs and management theorists===\nA 2002 survey of 58 business history professors gave the top spots in American business history to  [[Henry Ford]], followed by [[Bill Gates]]; [[John D. Rockefeller]]; [[Andrew Carnegie]], and [[Thomas Edison]].  They were followed by [[Sam Walton]]; [[J. P. Morgan]]; [[Alfred P. Sloan]]; [[Walt Disney]]; [[Ray Kroc]]; [[Thomas J.

Chandler]] (1918-2007) at the [[Harvard Business School]].  In a career that spanned over sixty years, Chandler produced numerous groundbreaking monographs, articles, and reviews. Intensely focused on only a few areas of the discipline, Chandler nonetheless succeeded in establishing and developing an entirely new realm of business history.<ref>Richard R. John, \"Elaborations, Revisions, Dissents: Alfred D. Chandler Jr.'s The Visible Hand after Twenty Years,\" ''Business History Review'' (1997) 7#1 pp 151-200 [http://www-personal.umich.edu/~twod/oil/NEW_SCHOOL_COURSE2005/articles/research-oil/research-oil/john_chandlers_visible_hand_20_yrs_after_bus-hst-revw_1997.pdf online]</ref><ref>Richard R.

Chandler, Jr. and the Landscape of Marketing History.\" ''Journal of Macromarketing'' 20#2 (2000): 167-173.</ref>\n\nChandler's masterwork was ''The Visible Hand: The Managerial Revolution in American Business'' (1977). His first two chapters looked at traditional owner-operated small business operations in commerce and production, including the largest among them, the slave plantations in the South. Chapters 3-5 summarize the history of railroad management, with stress on innovations not just in technology but also in accounting, finance and statistics. He then turned to the new business operations made possible by the rail system in mass distribution, such as jobbers, department stores and mail order. A quick survey (ch 8) review mass innovation in mass production. The integration of mass distribution and mass production (ch 9-11) led to many mergers and the emergence of giant industrial corporations by 1900.  Management for Chandler was much more than the CEO, it was the whole system of techniques and included middle management (ch 11) as well as the corporate structure of the biggest firms, Standard Oil, General Electric, US Steel, and DuPont (ch 13-14).  Chandler argued that modern large-scale firms arose to take advantage of the national markets and productive techniques available after the rail network was in place. He found that they prospered because they had higher productivity, lower costs, and higher profits. The firms created the \"managerial class\" in America because they needed to coordinate the increasingly complex and interdependent system.  This ability to achieve efficiency through coordination, not some anti-competitive monopolistic greed by robber barons, explained the high levels of concentration in modern American industry.<ref>Steven W. Usselman, \"Still Visible: Alfred D. Chandler's The Visible Hand,\" ''Technology and Culture'' vol 47 #3 (2006) 584-596</ref>\n\nChandler's work was somewhat ignored in history departments, but proved influential in business, economics, and sociology departments.<ref>Thomas K. McCraw, \"Alfred Chandler: His Vision and Achievement,\" ''Business History Review,'' Summer 2008, Vol. 82 Issue 2, pp 207-226</ref>  In sociology, for example, prior to Chandler's research, sociologists assumed there were no differences between governmental, corporate, and nonprofit organizations. Chandler's focus on corporations clearly demonstrated that there were differences, and this thesis has guided organizational sociologists' work since the 1970s. It also motivated sociologists to investigate and critique Chandler's work more closely, turning up instances in which Chandler assumed American corporations acted for reasons of efficiency when they actually operated in a context of politics or conflict.<ref>[[Neil Fligstein]], \"Chandler and the Sociology of Organizations,\" ''Business History Review,'' Summer 2008, Vol. 82 Issue 2, pp 241-250</ref> Other historians, such as [[Gabriel Kolko]], challenged the very notion of \"efficiency through coordination\", arguing instead that [[big business]] had, for reasons of inefficiency and a dislike of market discipline, openly sought government assistance to keep market forces at bay.\n\n===Other mechanisms===\nLamoreaux ''et al.'' (2003) offers a new synthesis of American business history during the 19th-20th centuries. Moving beyond the markets-versus-hierarchies framework that underlies the previously dominant interpretation of Chandler, the authors highlight the great variety of coordination mechanisms in use in the economy at any given time. Drawing on late-20th-century theoretical work in economics, they show how the relative advantages and disadvantages of these different mechanisms have shifted in complex and often unpredictable ways as a result of changing economic circumstances. One advantage of this perspective is that it avoids the teleology that has characterized so much writing in the field. As a result, the authors can situate the \"New Economy\" of the late 20th century in broad historical context without succumbing to the temptation to view it as a climactic stage in the process of economic development. They thus provide a particularly persuasive example of the importance of business history to the understanding of national and international history.<ref>Naomi R. Lamoreaux et al, \"Beyond Markets and Hierarchies: Toward a New Synthesis of American Business History.\" ''American Historical Review'' 2003 108(2): 404-433.</ref>\n\n===Comparative===\nUnderstanding the development of business history as a discipline meriting its own aims, theories and methods is often understood as a transition from dominating themes of 'company biography', toward more analytical 'comparative' approaches. This 'comparative' trend enabled practitioners to underline their work with 'generalist' potential. Questions of comparative business performance have become a staple, featuring into the wider economic histories of nations, regions and communities. For many this transition was first achieved by [[Alfred D. Chandler]]. Chandler\u2019s successors as Isidor Straus Professor of Business History at [[Harvard Business School]] continued to emphasize the importance of comparative research and course development. In 1995 [[Thomas K. McCraw]] published ''Creating Modern Capitalism'' (Cambridge, MA 1995) <ref name=\"McCraw1995\">{{cite book|author1=Thomas K. McCraw|title=Creating Modern Capitalism|year=1995|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=0-674-17555-7}}</ref> This book compared the business histories of Britain, Germany, Japan and the United States since the Industrial Revolution, and was used as the text of a new year MBA course at [[Harvard Business School]]. [[Geoffrey Jones (academic)|Geoffrey Jones]], who was McCraw\u2019s successor as Isidor Straus Professor of Business History, also pursued a comparative research agenda. He published a comparative study of the history of globalization called ''Multinationals and Global Capitalism'' (Oxford, 2005).<ref name=\"Jones2005\">{{cite book|author1=Geoffrey Jones|title=Multinationals and Global Capitalism|year=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-927210-7}}</ref> In 2010, Jones also published a comparative history of the global beauty industry entitled ''Beauty Imagined: A History of the Global Beauty Industry'' (Oxford, 2010).<ref name=Jones2010>{{cite book|author1=Geoffrey Jones|title=Beauty Imagined: A History of the Global Beauty Industry|publisher=Oxford University Press|date=2010|isbn=978-0199556496}}</ref> More recently, Jones and the Business History Initiative at the [[Harvard Business School]] has sought to facilitate research and teaching on African, Asian and Latin American business history in a project called Creating Emerging Markets, which includes interviews with long-time leaders of firms and NGOs in those regions.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hbs.edu/businesshistory/emerging-markets/Pages/default.aspx |website=Creating Emerging Markets |publisher=Harvard Business School}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/thriving-in-the-turbulence-of-emerging-markets |title=Thriving in the Turbulence of Emerging Markets |website=Working Knowledge: The Thinking That Leads |publisher=Harvard Business School |date=14 January 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/building-histories-of-emerging-economies-one-interview-at-a-time |title=Building Histories of Emerging Economies One Interview at a Time |website=Working Knowledge: The Thinking That Leads |publisher=Harvard Business School |date=28 May 2014}}</ref>\n\nA trend in recent years has been to compare the business histories of individual countries.

They argued that the economic development in this period stemmed from various phenomena of the late 19th century: the corporation system, the joint-stock deposit and investment banks, and the technological innovations in the steel industry. To clarify the contributions of 19th-century entrepreneurs to the economic development in France, French scholars support two journals, '' Enterprises et Histoire'' and ''Revue d'Histoire de la Siderurgie.''<ref>Youssef Cassis, \"Business History in France\" in Franco Amatori and Geoffrey Jones, eds.

Latin American business history developed in the 1960s, but until the 1980s it was dominated by either highly politicized debates over Latin American underdevelopment or biographies of Latin American entrepreneurs. Since the 1980s, Latin American business history has become a much more professionalized and an integrated part of Latin American academia. It is much less politicized and has moved beyond entrepreneurial biography to histories of companies and industries. However, Latin American business historians have still not devoted enough attention to agricultural enterprises or comparative histories between the many countries. Probably most importantly, Latin American business historians have to become much more versed in business history theory and methodology so as to get beyond mere summation of the region's economic past.<ref>Mar\u00eda In\u00e9s Barbero,  \"Business History in Latin America: A Historiographical Perspective,\" ''Business History Review,'' (2008) 82#3, pp 555-575</ref><ref>Carlos, Marichal, \"Archival Note: Banking History and Archives in Latin America,\" ''Business History Review,'' (2008) 82#3 pp 585-602</ref>\n\nIn the 1980s, numerous governments in Latin America adopted neoliberal policies.<ref>Gerardo Otero, \"The neoliberal food regime in Latin America: state, agribusiness transnational corporations and biotechnology.\" ''Canadian Journal of Development Studies/Revue canadienne d'\u00e9tudes du d\u00e9veloppement'' 33.3 (2012): 282-294 .</ref><ref> Ben Ross Schneider, \"The material bases of technocracy: Investor confidence and neoliberalism in Latin America.\" in ''The politics of expertise in Latin America'' edited by Miguel A.

The most influential of these early company histories was [[Charles Wilson (historian)]]\u2019s ''History of Unilever'', the first volume of which was published in 1954. Other examples included Coleman\u2019s work on Courtaulds and artificial fibres, Alford on Wills and the tobacco industry, Barker on Pilkington\u2019s and glass manufacture.<ref>John Wilson, and Steven Toms, J.S \u2018Fifty years of Business History\u2019, ''Business History'' (2008) 50#2 pp.125-26</ref><ref>. Leslie Hannah, \u2018New Issues in British Business History\u2019, ''Business History Review'' (1983) 57# 2, pp.165-174.</ref>  These early studies were conducted by primarily by economic historians interested in the role of leading firms in the development of the wider industry, and therefore went beyond mere corporate histories. Although some work examined the successful industries of the industrial revolution and the role of the key entrepreneurs, in the 1970s scholarly debate in British business history became increasingly focused on economic decline. For economic historians, the loss of British competitive advantage after 1870 could at least in part be explained by entrepreneurial failure, prompting further business history research into individual industry and corporate cases. The Lancashire cotton textile industry, which had been the leading take-off sector in the industrial revolution, but which was slow to invest in subsequent technical developments, became an important topic of debate on this subject. [[William Lazonick]] for example argued that cotton textile entrepreneurs in Britain failed to develop larger integrated plants on the American model; a conclusion similar to Chandler\u2019s synthesis of a number of comparative case studies.<ref>Chandler, A., Scale and Scope: The Dynamics of Industrial Capitalism, Cambridge Mass.: Belknap Press (1990).</ref><ref>William Mass, & William Lazonick, \"The British Cotton Industry and International Competitive Advantage: the state of the debates,\" ''Business History,'' (1990) 32#4 pp. 9-65.</ref>\n\nStudies of British business leaders have emphasized how they fit into the class structure, especially their relationship to the aristocracy, and the desire to use their wealth to purchase landed estates, and hereditary titles.<ref>Howard L. Malchow, ''Gentlemen capitalists: the social and political world of the Victorian businessman'' (Stanford University Press, 19920.</ref><ref>William D.

Jeremy, ed., ''Dictionary of business biography: a biographical dictionary of business leaders active in Britain in the period 1860-1980'' (Butterworths, 1984).</ref>\nBritish business history began to widen its scope in the 1980s, with research work conducted at the LSE's Business History Unit, led first by Leslie Hannah, then by Terry Gourvish. Other research centres followed, notably at Glasgow and Reading, reflecting an increasing involvement in the discipline by Business and Management School academics. More recent editors of ''Business History'', [[Geoffrey Jones (academic)]] (Harvard Business School), Charles Harvey (University of Newcastle Business School), John Wilson (Liverpool University Management School) and Steven Toms (Leeds University Business School) have promoted management strategy themes such as networks, family capitalism, corporate governance, human resource management, marketing and brands, and multi-national organisations in their international as well as merely British context. Employing these new themes has allowed business historians to challenge and adapt the earlier conclusions of Chandler and others about the performance of the British economy.<ref>Toms, Steven and Wilson, John F. \"Scale, Scope and Accountability: Towards a New Paradigm of British Business History,\" ''Business History'' (2003) 45#4 pp 1-23.</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n<references/>\n\n==Bibliography==\n<!-- Commented out: [[File:The Accidental Billionaires.jpg|230px|thumb|Right|Business history in the popular media focuses on intrigue and corruption]] -->\n\n===Textbooks and surveys: USA===\n* Blackford, Mansel G.

It was founded in 1870.\n\nVesta organises two [[head race]]s every year; the [[Scullers Head]] and the [[Veterans Head]].\n\n==History==\n===Foundation===\nVesta Rowing Club was founded in 1870. It is said that during the club's inaugural meeting, members decided that the club should be named after the first boat to pass under London Bridge. The first boat (a steam tug) to pass under the bridge was Vesta.\n\nThe club's first home was Salters Boathouse which was a part of Feathers Pub on the [[River Wandle]] which flows into the [[River Thames]] just up river from [[Wandsworth Bridge]]. In 1875, the club moved to the Unity boathouse (now the [[Ranelagh Sailing Club]]) and from there to its present clubhouse next door in 1890.\n\nTo begin with, the Vesta only raced in-house. The club's first known entry in an open race coming in 1876. The first open win came that year with J. Whaley winning the Junior Sculls at [[Windsor and Eton Regatta]]. The first sweep oared win did not come until 1888 and that was a Junior Senior IV at Walton Regatta.\n\n===20th century===\n\nFrom that date onwards Vesta had increasing success on the water, not the least of which included [[Harry Blackstaffe]]\u2019s double victory in the Diamond Sculls at [[Henley Royal Regatta]], the [[Wingfield Sculls]] on the Thames in 1906 and [[Olympic medal|Olympic Gold]] medal in the [[1908 London Olympics]].\n\nThe club practically ceased functioning during the Great War of 1914-18 only being kept alive through the activities of some of its older members and those on leave from the front who occasionally rowed. There were 214 paid up members of Vesta in 1914. 78 joined up of whom 12 made the ultimate sacrifice and gave their lives in that struggle.\n\nIn 1920 the club lost in the final of the Wyfold IVs at Henley Royal Regatta. It was the club\u2019s first finals day appearance at that August regatta in a sweep-oared boat. In 1930 the club finally had success in this class of boat at the Regatta winning the Thames Challenge Cup for club VIIIs.\n\nIn December 1936 a fire ripped through the clubhouse destroying many of its records and trophies, and damaging or destroying some thirty boats. That summer Eric Wingate and David Baddeley went on to win the Silver Goblets & Nichols Challenge Cup for the club at Henley Regatta.\n\nDuring the [[Second World War]] the [[London Fire Brigade]] requisitioned Vesta\u2019s clubhouse for the duration of the hostilities. Rowing however continued as Barclays Bank Rowing Club allowed Vesta to operate out of its premises further along the Embankment. Seven pre-war members of the club did not return from that conflict.\n\nIn 1960 the club\u2019s coxless IV won at Twickenham, Marlow, Kingston and as favourites, won through to the final at Henley Royal Regatta losing to St. Thomas\u2019 Hospital.\n\nIn 1976 the first VIII won the [[Grand Challenge Cup]] at [[Marlow Regatta]]. A coxless IV made up of rowers from this crew won a silver medal in that year's national championships.\n\nIn 1981 the club returned to winning ways at Henley Regatta with the club's coxed IV winning the Britannia Cup.\n\nThe club's highest ever finish in the Eights [[Head of the River Race]] was recorded in 1986 when the club's first VIII finished sixth overall, winning the Vernon Trophy as the fastest Tideway crew.\n\n===Senior Women===\n\nMarch 1994 was a notable year for the club when members voted to allow women join as full members. With time success followed. The club won Senior VIIIs and lightweight Sculls at [[Henley Women's Regatta]] in 2004. The women's senior squad repeated this victory in 2010 when they again won Senior VIIIs at that regatta and competed on Saturday at [[Henley Royal Regatta]]. The squad continued with their domestic success winning the Intermediate Club VIIIs at Henley Women's Regatta in 2011 and again in 2012.\n\n==Events==\nVesta has run many annual competitions down through the years. The club first started doing this in 1912. In 1923 the Vesta Dashes, which were a mid-summer short course competition run over three evenings, were instigated. As already stated in 1954 the club founded the Scullers\u2019 Head of the River race.\n\nIn 1981 Vesta organised the first [[Veterans\u2019 Head of the River Race]] when then main VIIIs Head race stopped taking Veteran entries. This race is now one of the largest head races that takes place on the tidal Thames with competitors and crews coming from across the UK and abroad to participate.\n\n==Notable results==\nIn 2009 the senior men's coxed IV reached the finals of the [[Britannia Challenge Cup]] at Henley Royal Regatta. Unfortunately, the unseeded Vesta crew were defeated by just under a length in the final to [[Agecroft RC]].\n\nIn 2014 Vesta won the Horton Cup for Senior coxless fours at the [[Metropolitan Regatta]] and raced through to Saturday of [[Henley Royal Regatta]].\n\n*1906 - Winner, [[Wingfield Sculls]]: [[Harry Blackstaffe]]\n*1908 - Winner, [[Diamond Sculls]], [[Henley Royal Regatta]]\n*1930 - Winner, Thames Challenge Cup, Henley Royal Regatta\n*1936 - Winners, [[Silver Goblets]], [[Henley Royal Regatta]]: Eric Wingate and David Baddeley\n*1976 - Silver, British National Rowing Championship,\n*1981 - Winners, [[Britannia Challenge Cup]], [[Henley Royal Regatta]]\n*1981 - Semi-finalists, Thames Challenge Cup, Henley Royal Regatta\n*2004 - Winner, Elite Lightweight Single Scull, [[Henley Women's Regatta]]: Charlotte Easton\n*2004 - Winners, Senior VIIIs, Henley Women's Regatta\n*2009 - Finalists, Britannia Challenge Cup, Henley Royal Regatta\n*2010 - Winners, Senior VIIIs, Henley Women's Regatta\n*2010 - Semi-finalists Remenham Challenge Cup, Henley Royal Regatta\n*2011 - Winners, Intermediate VIIIs, Henley Women's Regatta\n*2012 - Winners, Intermediate VIIIs, Henley Women's Regatta\n*2013 - 3rd Place, WEHORR\n*2013 - Quarter-finalists, Remenham Challenge Cup, Henley Royal Regatta\n*2013 - Semi-finalists, Wyfold Challenge Cup, Henley Royal Regatta\n\n==See also==\n*[[Rowing on the River Thames]]\n*[[Remenham Club]]\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.vestarowing.co.uk/ Vesta Rowing Club]\n{{Remenham Club}}\n{{Tideway rowing clubs}}\n\n[[Category:Tideway Rowing clubs]]\n[[Category:Remenham Club Founding Clubs]]\n", "text_old": "{{Unreferenced|date=July 2013}}{{Infobox Rowing Club\n| ClubName         = Vesta Rowing Club\n| ClubhouseImage   =Vesta Rowing Club, Putney Embankment (geograph 2106046).jpg\n| BladeColourImage = Vesta_Rowing_Blade.svg\n| Emblem           =\n| Location         = [[Putney]], London, England\n| Coordinates      = {{coord|51|28|10.4|N|0|13|13.3|W|scale:2000_region:GB|display=inline,title|name=Vesta Rowing Club}}\n| Founded          = {{Start date|1870}}\n| Motto            =\n| Membership       =\n| HomeWater        = [[Tideway]]\n| Website          = {{URL|www.vestarowing.co.uk}}\n| Affiliations     = {{Plainlist|\n* [[British Rowing]]\n* [[Thames Regional Rowing Council]]\n* [[Remenham Club]]\n}}\n| Events           = {{Flatlist|\n* [[Scullers Head]]\n* [[Veterans Head]]\n}}\n| Distinctions     =\n| NotableMembers   = [[Harry Blackstaffe]]}}\n'''Vesta Rowing Club''' is a rowing club based on the [[Tideway]] [[River Thames]] in [[Putney]], London, England.

In 1983, Hirose was admitted by [[Waseda University]] and chose [[applied physics]] as his major. In 1987, Hirose graduated from Waseda University as the best student in his grade and entered the Graduate School of Waseda University with a research topic on [[high-temperature superconductivity]]. Working with his supervisor, he published a paper in July 1987. His supervisor said Hirose was a gifted scientist. At the same time, Hirose began to wonder if the knowledge he learned in the university could help the society.<ref name=Asahihirose>{{cite web |title=\u7269\u7406\u306e\u79c0\u624d\u30fb\u5e83\u702c\u5065\u4e00\u304c\u9ebb\u539f\u306e\u300c\u6d6e\u63da\u300d\u3092\u4fe1\u3058\u305f\u77ac\u9593\u3000\uff1c\u6559\u56e3\u30a8\u30ea\u30fc\u30c8\u306e\u300c\u7f6a\u3068\u7f70\u300d\uff085\uff09\uff1e |url=https://dot.asahi.com/wa/2018072600026.html?page=2 |website=\u9031\u520a\u671d\u65e5 |accessdate=2018-10-31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180726114103/https://dot.asahi.com/wa/2018072600026.html?page=2 |archive-date=2018-07-26 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=\"\u4f50\u6728\u9686\u4e091999\">{{cite book|author=\u4f50\u6728\u9686\u4e09|title=\u5c11\u5e74\u72af\u7f6a\u306e\u98a8\u666f: \u300c\u89aa\u5b50\u306e\u6cd5\u5ef7\u300d\u3067\u8003\u3048\u305f\u3053\u3068|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2rcoAQAAIAAJ|year=1999|publisher=\u6771\u4eac\u66f8\u7c4d|page=52}}</ref><ref name=FNNHirose>{{cite web |title=\u30b5\u30ea\u30f3\u3092\u300e\u30b5\u30ea\u30fc\u3061\u3083\u3093\u300f\u3068\u547c\u3093\u3067\u3044\u305f\u300d\u30aa\u30a6\u30e0\u5e79\u90e8 \u5e83\u702c\u5065\u4e00\u6b7b\u5211\u56da\u3010\u6b7b\u5211\u57f7\u884c\u3011 |url=https://www.fnn.jp/posts/00341840HDK |website=FNN |accessdate=2018-10-31}}</ref><ref name=\"\u4f50\u6728\u9686\u4e092002\">{{cite book|author=\u4f50\u6728\u9686\u4e09|title=\u5927\u7fa9\u306a\u304d\u30c6\u30ed\u30ea\u30b9\u30c8: \u30aa\u30a6\u30e0\u6cd5\u5ef7\u306e16\u88ab\u544a|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v7DtPAAACAAJ|date=25 November 2002|publisher=\u65e5\u672c\u653e\u9001\u51fa\u7248\u5354\u4f1a|isbn=978-4-14-080728-6}}</ref><ref name=\"Ebert2012\">{{cite book|author=John David Ebert|title=The Age of Catastrophe: Disaster and Humanity in Modern Times|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UQwU80HzPEkC&pg=PA97|date=30 August 2012|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-7142-3|pages=97\u201398}}</ref>\n\n==Joining Aum Shinrikyo and leading secret assault rifle production==\nIn 1988, Hirose read books written by [[Shoko Asahara]] by accident.

His musical career was short-lived and little was heard of him since the second half of the 1980s. In the early 1990's, rumor spread that Billy Boyo and Little Harry had been shot and killed. However this proved to be untrue. Billy in fact died of a brain tumour on 29 October 2000, after a two-month-long struggle to beat the disease{{fact|date=January 2019}}.\n\n== Discography ==\n\n* The Very Best Of Me. 1980-82.\n* Zim Zim 1983\n* DJ Clash vol 2 ([[Little Harry]] & Billy Boyo). 1983.\n\n''Compilations''\n\n* D.J.

''Danger 5'' was the chosen concept, the most ambitious and dense of the three.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\n==Setting and Style==\n\nThe first series is nominally set in World War II but uses a style more akin to pulp TV spy series. The titular Danger 5 are a small group of Allied agents who are tasked with stopping various schemes overseen by [[Adolf Hitler]]. Each episode sees an intentionally ahistorical version of a major Axis person come up with a bizarre plan more in line with a TV or comic book villain of the fifties or sixties - stealing monuments from Allied nations to build an absurd Nazi super-monument, resurrecting dinosaurs, running a fixed casino to make weapons from gold and reprogramming captured airmen as Japanese pilots.\n\nThe series adds a further layer of satire by intentionally aping the production and dated values. Obvious studio sets are used for outdoor shots, model work is intentionally poor, usually featuring unrealistic movements and visible strings, the characters often laugh at bad puns immediately following the deaths of allies. All drink and smoke conspicuously while non-white characters are often played by Caucasians with poor make-up. Stock footage is also used, most notably a shot of Hitler jumping through a glass window to escape that is reused in settings that feature no such window.\n\nFurther surreal humour comes from the characters treating their universe seriously and not questioning various situations that are inexplicable to the viewer.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n<!-- NOTE; READ THIS NOTE: Per Wikipedia:WikiProject Television/Style guidelines#Cast information, \"The cast should be organized according to the series original broadcast credits, with new cast members being added to the end of the list. Please keep in mind that 'main' cast status is determined by the series producers, not by popularity or screen time.

All are highly trained, happy to kill without feeling any remorse, drink alcohol casually before, during and after what are pitched as serious military operations and chain-smoke.\n\n====Jackson====\n\nJackson (David Ashby) is a macho and fiercely patriotic American, once abandoning the team in a futile attempt to prevent Hitler stealing the Statue of Liberty. He clashes frequently with Tucker on missions due to having a hedonistic and selfish approach to work. Jackson harbours an unrequited crush on Ilsa and reads ''Real Man Magazine''.\n\n====Ilsa====\n\nIlsa ([[Natasa Ristic]]) is a Russian, and speaks all of her dialogue in Russian with subtitles, which everyone understands without comment. She wears her uniform with as much flesh showing as possible and sees little problem with using sex to help the team in their missions (once redirecting Joseph Goebbels by performing oral sex on him) or even if she just feels like it. This may be down to the stated lack of emotions Russians in the series have. She feels Claire is a prude and is aware of Jackson's feelings for her but seems indifferent. Ilsa is also a former wife of [[Erwin Rommel]].\n\n====Tucker====\n\nTucker is an uptight Australian member of the team. He is straight-laced to the point that hearing [[bossa nova]] causes him to suffer nosebleeds while he is often irked by the rest of the team being so easily distracted, though he is frequently undermined when they prove successful. He is a fan of ''Sensible Chuckle'' magazine and is in love with Claire, who saves him from becoming an indestructible Japanese robot-man. He later woos her with a self-written piece for the recorder and they finally kiss when the team seemingly kill Hitler in a [[Tokusatsu|tokusatsu mech]] battle, ending World War II. Despite being portrayed in-universe as a square he still partakes in the same level of drinking and smoking as everyone else.\n\nAt the start of the second series they are preparing to get married when Claire is murdered by a returning Hitler. A grief-stricken Tucker attempts to turn himself into a brooding revenge-driven ninja in response but turns out to be inept. Throughout the series, he suffers flashbacks of Claire's beheading and carries her head around with him.\n\n====Claire====\n\nClaire is a [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] graduate and a  prim, chaste English woman. She is frequently uncomfortable around Ilsa and Jackson's openly sexual behaviour and initially frosty towards Tucker's more reserved approaches, though in the latter case she eventually relents. Claire is easily the most intelligent and capable member of the team in an intentional comment on the sexism of the shows ''Danger 5'' is spoofing. She is largely ignored; Colonel Chestbridge especially takes great pleasure in belittling the usually salient points she raises during briefings. \n\nShe is set to marry Tucker at the start of the second series but is killed on the day of her wedding.\n\n====Pierre====\n\nPierre is of hazy European origin and obsessed with making the team cocktails. There are a series of recurring jokes around the character - wherever the team are sent he seemingly unexpectedly runs into an old acquaintance who knows him by a different name and hints at a mysterious past for Pierre; said acquaintance then dies in his arms partway through the episode, imparting a 'perfect ' cocktail recipe with their dying words.\n\nPierre is the easiest-going member of the team and something of a neutral between the headstrong Jackson & Ilsa and the conservative Tucker & Claire. He is also the only member of the team to ever show any sort of emotional reaction to the repeated deaths of most of those unfortunate enough to get involved in a Danger 5 mission. The rest of the team are always oblivious to these moments.\n\nIn series 2, Pierre is played by [[Pacharo Mzembe]]. The change is never mentioned in the series. Between Series 1 and 2, Pierre has become an internationally famous musician. He is widely recognized by the general public and beats Johnny Hitler for the title of Christmas King due to his fame. In the episode \"Un Sacco Di Natale\", Pierre tells the Nazis disguised as priests that he is Catholic.\n\n====Kilroy====\n\nA sixth member of the team inexplicably introduced partway through the series 1 finale, Kilroy is a cel-animated anthropomorphic dog. His cartoon nature is never mentioned by anyone, nor is his sudden appearance. He largely speaks in hackneyed surfer vernacular until he is fatally shot in the head by Hitler midway through the episode.

''Danger 5'' was the chosen concept, the most ambitious and dense of the three.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\n==Setting and Style==\n\nThe first series is nominally set in World War II but uses a style more akin to pulp TV spy series. The titular Danger 5 are a small group of Allied agents who are tasked with stopping various schemes overseen by [[Adolf Hitler]]. Each episode sees an intentionally ahistorical version of a major Axis person come up with a bizarre plan more in line with a TV or comic book villain of the fifties or sixties - stealing monuments from Allied nations to build an absurd Nazi super-monument, resurrecting dinosaurs, running a fixed casino to make weapons from gold and reprogramming captured airmen as Japanese pilots.\n\nThe series adds a further layer of satire by intentionally aping the production and dated values. Obvious studio sets are used for outdoor shots, model work is intentionally poor, usually featuring unrealistic movements and visible strings, the characters often laugh at bad puns immediately following the deaths of allies. All drink and smoke conspicuously while non-white characters are often played by Caucasians with poor make-up. Stock footage is also used, most notably a shot of Hitler jumping through a glass window to escape that is reused in settings that feature no such window.\n\nFurther surreal humour comes from the characters treating their universe seriously and not questioning various situations that are inexplicable to the viewer.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n<!-- NOTE; READ THIS NOTE: Per Wikipedia:WikiProject Television/Style guidelines#Cast information, \"The cast should be organized according to the series original broadcast credits, with new cast members being added to the end of the list. Please keep in mind that 'main' cast status is determined by the series producers, not by popularity or screen time.

All are highly trained, happy to kill without feeling any remorse, drink alcohol casually before, during and after what are pitched as serious military operations and chain-smoke.\n\n====Jackson====\n\nJackson (David Ashby) is a macho and fiercely patriotic American, once abandoning the team in a futile attempt to prevent Hitler stealing the Statue of Liberty. He clashes frequently with Tucker on missions due to having a hedonistic and selfish approach to work. Jackson harbours an unrequited crush on Ilsa and reads ''Real Man Magazine''.\n\n====Ilsa====\n\nIlsa ([[Natasa Ristic]]) is a Russian, and speaks all of her dialogue in Russian with subtitles, which everyone understands without comment. She wears her uniform with as much flesh showing as possible and sees little problem with using sex to help the team in their missions (once redirecting Joseph Goebbels by performing oral sex on him) or even if she just feels like it. This may be down to the stated lack of emotions Russians in the series have. She feels Claire is a prude and is aware of Jackson's feelings for her but seems indifferent. Ilsa is also a former wife of [[Erwin Rommel]].\n\n====Tucker====\n\nTucker is an uptight Australian member of the team. He is straight-laced to the point that hearing [[bosa nova]] causes him to suffer nosebleeds while he is often irked by the rest of the team being so easily distracted, though he is frequently undermined when they prove successful. He is a fan of ''Sensible Chuckle'' magazine and is in love with Claire, who saves him from becoming an indestructible Japanese robot-man. He later woos her with a self-written piece for the recorder and they finally kiss when the team seemingly kill Hitler in a tokusatsu mech battle, ending World War II. Despite being portrayed in-universe as a square he still partakes in the same level of drinking and smoking as everyone else.\n\nAt the start of the second series they are preparing to get married when Claire is murdered by a returning Hitler. A grief-stricken Tucker attempts to turn himself into a brooding revenge-driven ninja in response but turns out to be inept. Throughout the series, he suffers flashbacks of Claire's beheading and carries her head around with him.\n\n====Claire====\n\nClaire is a [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] graduate and a  prim, chaste English woman. She is frequently uncomfortable around Ilsa and Jackson's openly sexual behaviour and initially frosty towards Tucker's more reserved approaches, though in the latter case she eventually relents. Claire is easily the most intelligent and capable member of the team in an intentional comment on the sexism of the shows ''Danger 5'' is spoofing. She is largely ignored; Colonel Chestbridge especially takes great pleasure in belittling the usually salient points she raises during briefings. \n\nShe is set to marry Tucker at the start of the second series but is killed on the day of her wedding.\n\n====Pierre====\n\nPierre is of hazy European origin and obsessed with making the team cocktails. There are a series of recurring jokes around the character - wherever the team are sent he seemingly unexpectedly runs into an old acquaintance who knows him by a different name and hints at a mysterious past for Pierre; said acquaintance then dies in his arms partway through the episode, imparting a 'perfect ' cocktail recipe with their dying words.\n\nPierre is the easiest-going member of the team and something of a neutral between the headstrong Jackson & Ilsa and the conservative Tucker & Claire. He is also the only member of the team to ever show any sort of emotional reaction to the repeated deaths of most of those unfortunate enough to get involved in a Danger 5 mission. The rest of the team are always oblivious to these moments.\n\nIn series 2, Pierre is played by [[Pacharo Mzembe]]. The change is never mentioned in the series. Between Series 1 and 2, Pierre has become an internationally famous musician. He is widely recognized by the general public and beats Johnny Hitler for the title of Christmas King due to his fame. In the episode \"Un Sacco Di Natale\", Pierre tells the Nazis disguised as priests that he is Catholic.\n\n====Kilroy====\n\nA sixth member of the team inexplicably introduced partway through the series 1 finale, Kilroy is a cel-animated anthropomorphic dog. His cartoon nature is never mentioned by anyone, nor is his sudden appearance. He largely speaks in hackneyed surfer vernacular until he is fatally shot in the head by Hitler midway through the episode. After imparting a dying cocktail recipe to Pierre he is never seen, mentioned or referenced ever again.\n\n====Colonel Chestbridge====\n\nThe team's superior who gives them their missions -which always finish with a reminder to \"kill Hitler \". He has a bird's head which, in keeping with the show's style of humour, is unexplained or mentioned by any other characters. The Colonel displays open irritation and contempt for Claire and grows more irascible as the first series goes on due to the team's failures to kill Hitler and end the war, escalating to using a shotgun to keep order during a briefing.\n\nHe is seemingly retired at the start of the second series but is targeted and killed by Hitler.\n\n== Episodes ==\n\n===Series 1 (2012)===\nThis list is ordered by the original air dates on SBS One in Australia.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n|- style=\"color:white\"\n! style=\"background:#000;width:%5;\"|no in <br /> series\n! style=\"background:#000;width:%5;\"|no in <br /> season\n! style=\"background:#000;\"|Title\n! style=\"background:#000;width:%25;\"|Original airdate\n|-\n|-\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber = 0\n|EpisodeNumber2 = 0\n|RTitle = \"The Diamond Girls\" (prequel episode aired on [[YouTube]])\n|OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|df=yes|2011|11|20}}\n|ShortSummary = Deep in Nazi Germany, Jackson, Pierre and Tucker have been working undercover in Adolf Hitler's favourite bar, the Black Dog, waiting for the perfect chance to knock off the big man, and end the Second World War.
