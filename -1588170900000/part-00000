The most influential specimen was [[La Chapelle-aux-Saints 1]] (\"The Old Man\") from [[La Chapelle-aux-Saints]], France. French palaeontologist [[Marcellin Boule]] authored several publications, among the first to establish palaeontology as a science, detailing the specimen, but reconstructed him as slouching, ape-like, and only remotely related to modern humans. The 1912 'discovery' of [[Piltdown Man]] (a hoax), appearing much more similar to modern humans than Neanderthals, was used as evidence that multiple different and unrelated branches of primitive humans existed, and supported Boule's reconstruction of ''H. neanderthalensis'' as a far distant relative and an [[evolutionary dead-end]].<ref name=boule>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/b22463355|first=M.|last=Boule|authorlink=Marcellin Boule|year=1911|title=L'homme fossile de La Chapelle-aux-Saints|trans-title=Fossil man from La Chapelle-aux-Saints|language=French|publisher=Masson|pages=[https://archive.org/details/b22463355/page/n16 1]\u201362}}</ref><ref name=drell2000/><ref name=Reybrouck2002>{{cite journal|first=D.|last=Van Reybrouck|authorlink=David Van Reybrouck|year=2002|title=Boule's error: on the social context of scientific knowledge|journal=Antiquity|volume=76|issue=291|pages=158\u2013164|doi=10.1017/S0003598X00089936}}</ref><ref name=Langdon2016/> He fueled the popular image of Neanderthals as barbarous, slouching, club-wielding primitives; this image was reproduced for several decades and popularised in [[science fiction]] works, such as the 1911 ''[[The Quest for Fire]]'' by [[J.-H.

Ideas such as Neanderthal behaviour, intelligence, and culture were being discussed, and a more humanlike image of them emerged. In 1939, American anthropologist [[Carlton Coon]] reconstructed a Neanderthal in a modern business suit and hat to emphasize that they would be, more or less, indistinguishable from modern humans had they survived into the present.

Two-phase argues a single major environmental event\u2014such as the [[Saale glaciation]]\u2014caused European ''H. heidelbergensis'' to rapidly increase body size and robustness, as well as undergo an enlengthenment of the head (phase 1), which then led to other changes in skull anatomy (phase 2).<ref name=\"speciation\"/> However, Neanderthal anatomy may not have been driven entirely by adapting to cold weather.<ref name=stewart2019/> Accretion holds that Neanderthals slowly evolved over time from the ancestral ''H. heidelbergensis'', divided into 4 stages: early-pre-Neanderthals ([[Anglian stage|MIS 12]], [[Elster glaciation]]), pre-Neanderthals ''[[sensu lato]]'' (MIS [[Marine Isotope Stage 11|11]]\u2013[[Marine Isotope Stage 9|9]], [[Holstein interglacial]]), early Neanderthals (MIS 7\u2013[[Marine Isotope Stage 5|5]], [[Saale glaciation]]\u2013[[Eemian]]), and classic Neanderthals ''[[sensu stricto]]'' (MIS 4\u20133, [[W\u00fcrm glaciation]]).<ref name = \"Dean1998\"/>\n\nNumerous dates for the Neanderthal/human split have been suggested. The date of around 250 kya cites \"''[[Florisbad Skull|H. helmei]]''\" as being the last common ancestor (LCA), and the split is associated with the [[Levallois technique]] of making stone tools. The date of about 400 kya uses ''H. heidelbergensis'' as the LCA. 600 kya says that \"''[[Homo rhodesiensis|H. rhodesiensis]]''\" was the LCA, which split off into modern human lineage and a Neanderthal/''H. heidelbergensis'' lineage.<ref name=endicott/> 800 kya has ''[[Homo antecessor|H. antecessor]]'' as the LCA, but different variations of this model would push the date back to 1 million years ago.<ref name=endicott/><ref name=meyer2016/> However, a 2020 analysis of ''H. antecessor'' enamel [[proteome]]s suggests that ''H. antecessor'' is related but not a direct ancestor.<ref>{{cite journal|first=F.|last=Welker|display-authors=et al.|title=The dental proteome of ''Homo antecessor''|journal=Nature|year=2020|volume=580|issue=7802|pages=235\u2013238|doi=10.1038/s41586-020-2153-8|pmid = 32269345}}</ref> DNA studies have yielded various results on Neanderthal/human divergence time, such as 538\u2013315 kya,<ref name=stringer/> 553\u2013321 kya,<ref>{{cite journal|first=A.

Because Neanderthals are known to have practised cannibalism to an extent and to have co-existed with modern humans, British palaeoanthropologist Simon Underdown speculated that modern humans transmitted a kuru-like spongiform disease to Neanderthals, and, because the 129 variant appears to have been absent in Neanderthals, it quickly killed them off.<ref name=underdown2008>{{cite journal|first=S.|last=Underdown|year=2008|title=A potential role for transmissible spongiform encephalopathies in Neanderthal extinction|journal=Medical Hypotheses|volume=71|issue=1|pages=4\u20137|doi=10.1016/j.mehy.2007.12.014|pmid=18280671}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Liberski |first1=P. |title=Kuru: a journey back in time from Papua New Guinea to the Neanderthals' extinction |journal=Pathogens |volume=2 |issue=3 |pages=472\u2013505 |year=2013 |pmid=25437203 |pmc=4235695 |doi=10.3390/pathogens2030472 }}</ref>\n\n==In popular culture==\n{{Main|Neanderthals in popular culture}}\n[[File:BlackTerror1636.jpg|thumb|upright|Cavemen in ''[[wikisource:The Black Terror/16|The Black Terror #16]]'' (1946)|alt=3 panels, a brawny man standing to the left and a child to the right on grass in front of a cave.

Ideas such as Neanderthal behaviour, intelligence, and culture were being discussed, and a more humanlike image of them emerged.

Two-phase argues a single major environmental event\u2014such as the [[Saale glaciation]]\u2014caused European ''H. heidelbergensis'' to rapidly increase body size and robustness, as well as undergo an enlengthenment of the head (phase 1), which then led to other changes in skull anatomy (phase 2).<ref name=\"speciation\"/> However, Neanderthal anatomy may not have been driven entirely by adapting to cold weather.<ref name=stewart2019/> Accretion holds that Neanderthals slowly evolved over time from the ancestral ''H. heidelbergensis'', divided into 4 stages: early-pre-Neanderthals ([[Anglian stage|MIS 12]], [[Elster glaciation]]), pre-Neanderthals ''[[sensu lato]]'' (MIS [[Marine Isotope Stage 11|11]]\u2013[[Marine Isotope Stage 9|9]], [[Holstein interglacial]]), early Neanderthals (MIS 7\u2013[[Marine Isotope Stage 5|5]], [[Saale glaciation]]\u2013[[Eemian]]), and classic Neanderthals ''[[sensu stricto]]'' (MIS 4\u20133, [[W\u00fcrm glaciation]]).<ref name = \"Dean1998\"/>\n\nNumerous dates for the Neanderthal/human split have been suggested. The date of around 250 kya cites \"''[[Florisbad Skull|H. helmei]]''\" as being the last common ancestor (LCA), and the split is associated with the [[Levallois technique]] of making stone tools. The date of about 400 kya uses ''H. heidelbergensis'' as the LCA. 600 kya says that \"''[[Homo rhodesiensis|H. rhodesiensis]]''\" was the LCA, which split off into modern human lineage and a Neanderthal/''H. heidelbergensis'' lineage.<ref name=endicott/> 800 kya has ''[[Homo antecessor|H. antecessor]]'' as the LCA, but different variations of this model would push the date back to 1 million years ago.<ref name=endicott/><ref name=meyer2016/> However, a 2020 analysis of ''H. antecessor'' enamel [[proteome]]s suggests that ''H. antecessor'' is related but not a direct ancestor.<ref>{{cite journal|first=F.|last=Welker|display-authors=et al.|title=The dental proteome of ''Homo antecessor''|journal=Nature|year=2020|volume=580|issue=7802|pages=235\u2013238|doi=10.1038/s41586-020-2153-8|pmid = 32269345}}</ref> DNA studies have yielded various results on Neanderthal/human divergence time, such as 538\u2013315 kya,<ref name=stringer/> 553\u2013321 kya,<ref>{{cite journal|first=A.

Because Neanderthals are known to have practised cannibalism to an extent and to have co-existed with modern humans, British palaeoanthropologist Simon Underdown speculated that modern humans transmitted a kuru-like spongiform disease to Neanderthals, and, because the 129 variant appears to have been absent in Neanderthals, it quickly killed them off.<ref name=underdown2008>{{cite journal|first=S.|last=Underdown|year=2008|title=A potential role for transmissible spongiform encephalopathies in Neanderthal extinction|journal=Medical Hypotheses|volume=71|issue=1|pages=4\u20137|doi=10.1016/j.mehy.2007.12.014|pmid=18280671}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Liberski |first1=P. |title=Kuru: a journey back in time from Papua New Guinea to the Neanderthals' extinction |journal=Pathogens |volume=2 |issue=3 |pages=472\u2013505 |year=2013 |pmid=25437203 |pmc=4235695 |doi=10.3390/pathogens2030472 }}</ref>\n\n==In popular culture==\n{{Main|Neanderthals in popular culture}}\n[[File:BlackTerror1636.jpg|thumb|upright|Cavemen in ''[[wikisource:The Black Terror/16|The Black Terror #16]]'' (1946)|alt=3 panels, a brawny man standing to the left and a child to the right on grass in front of a cave.

The \"[[caveman]]\" [[archetype]] often mocks Neanderthals, and depicts them as primitive, hunchbacked, knuckle-dragging, club wielding, grunting, anti-social characters driven solely by animal instinct. \"Neanderthal\" can also be used as an insult.<ref name=papagianni2015>{{cite book|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9As7CwAAQBAJ&pg=PT171|first=D.|last=Papagianni|first2=M.

G.

Pelican cases feature a lifetime guarantee. In Europe, they are sold as Peli cases.\n\nIf the case falls into water, generally there will be enough air in the case to keep it afloat. The barometric relief valve permits air to pass through, but not water or other liquids. Under some extreme conditions leakage is technically possible, but such conditions are unlikely to be encountered, except in the case of deliberate vandalism.\n\nPelican Products also manufactures customized rotationally molded cases built for specialized sensitive equipment protection. The cases can be modified with features including internal shock-mount systems, manual pressure relief valves, humidity indicators, custom foam, and fabricated metal framing for electronics. Pelican Products also runs a series of Advanced Case Centers in California, Virginia, Massachusetts, Canada, France, United Kingdom, and Australia that handle customization and design work for their cases.{{cn|date=November 2018}} The official distributor in Russia is Protect Studio.<ref>Official distributor in Russia https://protect.studio/about/</ref>\n\n== Temperature Controlled Packaging ==\nPelican's BioThermal division offers passive temperature-controlled products and service solutions including single-use and reusable parcels, single use and reusable pallets and rental programs for the pharmaceutical industry.\n\n==Flashlights==\nPelican flashlights (known as ''Pelican Lights'') use [[Incandescent light bulb|Xenon]], [[Halogen lamp|Halogen]], and [[LED]] lamps.

Kapyl was part of the dowry of [[Sophia Olelkovich Radziwill|Zofia Olelkowicz S\u0142ucka]] and was one of the seven fortified towns left to her husband [[Janusz Radziwill (1579\u20131620)|Janusz Radziwill]] upon her death in 1612.<ref name=\"Geographical Dictionary of Polish Kingdom\">[http://dir.icm.edu.pl/pl/Slownik_geograficzny/Tom_IV/386], Geographical Dictionary of Polish Kingdom and other Slavic countries (in Polish), vol 4, edited by F.

With this privilege came the right to hold fairs and weekly auctions.  During the 16th century weaving became established in the town, including the production of velvet.  Six guilds came into existence as a result of the growth of the weaving industry.\n\nAfter the [[Second Partition of Poland]] in 1793 Kapyl became part of the [[Russian Empire]].  From 1832 it became a personal holding of [[Peter Wittgenstein|Prince Wittgenstein]].  During the 19th century local businesses included a brewery, 2 water mills, and 6 shops.   Other local institutions included 3 schools, churches (including a [[Calvinist]] church), and 2 Jewish [[synagogue]]s.\n\nTowards the end of the 19th century Kapyl had over 350 houses and over 2000 inhabitants.

In 1395 it came into the possession of Prince [[Vladimir Olgerdovich]] and his heirs, the [[Olelkovich]] family, where it remained until 1612.  Kapyl was part of the dowry of [[Sophia Olelkovich Radziwill|Zofia Olelkowicz S\u0142ucka]] and was one of the seven fortified towns left to her husband [[Janusz Radziwill (1579\u20131620)|Janusz Radziwill]] upon her death in 1612.<ref name=\"Geographical Dictionary of Polish Kingdom\">[http://dir.icm.edu.pl/pl/Slownik_geograficzny/Tom_IV/386], Geographical Dictionary of Polish Kingdom and other Slavic countries (in Polish), vol 4, edited by F.

With this privilege came the right to hold fairs and weekly auctions.  During the 16th century weaving became established in the town, including the production of velvet.  Six guilds came into existence as a result of the growth of the weaving industry.\n\nAfter the [[Second Partition of Poland]] in 1793 Kapyl became part of the [[Russian Empire]].  From 1832 it became a personal holding of [[Peter Wittgenstein|Prince Wittgenstein]].  During the 19th century local businesses included a brewery, 2 water mills, and 6 shops.   Other local institutions included 3 schools, churches (including a [[Calvinist]] church), and 2 Jewish [[synagogue]]s.\n\nTowards the end of the 19th century Kapyl had over 350 houses and over 2000 inhabitants.  At that time a majority of the town\u2019s population was Jewish.<ref name=\"Geographical Dictionary of Polish Kingdom\"/>  By 1900 the Jewish population was 2,671.<ref name=\"Kapyl, Belarus on JewishGen.Org\"/>\n\nIn 1924, Kapyl became the capital city of the Kapyl District.\n\nDuring [[World War II]] the Slutsk-Kapyl area was the subject of a German military operation code-named Erntefest II (Harvest Festival) which ended in February 1943.  Although ostensibly aimed at suppressing the activities of Soviet partisans in the area the operation resulted in the deaths of 2,325 of the local inhabitants (against the loss of six German soldiers), which can only be characterized as a campaign of genocide and terror.<ref name=\"Rodoh Forum: Major Antipartisan Operations in Belorussia\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20101025103351/http://rodohforum.yuku.com/topic/2482], Rodoh Forum: Major Antipartisan Operations in Belorussia accessed 13 July 2010</ref>\n\nOne of Kapyl district\u2019s major architectural monuments is a 19th-century church in the town itself.<ref name=\"Kapyl District at Treklens\">[http://www.treklens.com/gallery/photo448602.htm], Kapyl District at Treklens accessed 13 July 2010</ref>\n\n==Personalities==\nKapyl is also known as the birthplace of [[Mendele Mocher Sforim]].\n\n==Sister cities==\n*{{flagicon|LIT}} [[Joni\u0161kis]], Lithuania<ref>{{cite web|title=International Relations|url=http://www.joniskis.lt/International%20relations%20713|work=joniskis.lt|accessdate=29 April 2014}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n[[List of towns with German town law]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* [http://dir.icm.edu.pl/pl/Slownik_geograficzny/Tom_IV/386 Geographical Dictionary of Polish Kingdom and other Slavic countries (in Polish), vol 4, edited by F.

The film features an [[ensemble cast]], including [[Al Pacino]], [[Cameron Diaz]], [[Dennis Quaid]], [[Jamie Foxx]], [[James Woods]], [[LL Cool J]], [[Ann-Margret]], [[Lauren Holly]], [[Matthew Modine]], [[John C. McGinley]], [[Charlton Heston]], [[Bill Bellamy]], [[Lela Rochon]], [[Aaron Eckhart]], [[Elizabeth Berkley]], [[The Boogeyman (wrestler)|Marty Wright]], and  NFL players [[Jim Brown]] and [[Lawrence Taylor]]. It is partly based on the novel ''On Any Given Sunday'' by famed NFL defensive end [[Pat Toomay]]; the title is derived from a line in the book (also used in the film) that a team can win or lose on \"any given Sunday\", said by the fictitious coach Tony D'Amato.\n\nCameo roles also featured many former American football players including [[Dick Butkus]], [[Y. A. Tittle]], [[Pat Toomay]], [[Warren Moon]], [[Johnny Unitas]], [[Ricky Watters]], [[Emmitt Smith]] and [[Terrell Owens]], as well as coach [[Barry Switzer]].\n\n==Plot==\n\nThe Miami Sharks, a once-great [[American football]] team, are struggling to make the 2001 Associated Football Franchises of America (AFFA) [[playoffs]]. They are coached by thirty-year veteran Tony D'Amato ([[Al Pacino]]), who has fallen out of favor with young team owner Christina Pagniacci ([[Cameron Diaz]]) and [[offensive coordinator]] and D'Amato's expected successor Nick Crozier ([[Aaron Eckhart]]). In the thirteenth game of the season, both [[starting quarterback]] Jack \"Cap\" Rooney ([[Dennis Quaid]]) and second-string quarterback Tyler Cherubini ([[Pat O'Hara]]) are injured and forced to leave the field. The desperate Sharks call upon third-string quarterback Willie Beamen ([[Jamie Foxx]]) to replace them. Beamen played college ball at the University of Houston. While a nervous Beamen makes a number of errors and fails to win the game for the Sharks, he plays well and gains confidence. Rooney vows to make it back by the playoffs, with D'Amato promising to not give up on him.\n\nThe next day, D'Amato and Pagniacci argue about the direction of the team. Pagniacci favors Crozier and wants to eventually cut Rooney. D'Amato argues that Pagniacci's father, the previous owner, would never meddle in his coaching plans. During the next game, to D'Amato's chagrin, Beamen disregards the team's conservative [[offense (sports)|offense]] and changes plays in the huddle. As the media hails Beamen as the next model of quarterback, the new-found success feeds his growing [[narcissism]] and leads to tension with teammates and coaches. During a confrontation with Beamen, D'Amato [[demotion|demotes]] him back to the bench. After Beamen gives an interview taking sole credit for the Sharks' winning streak, the other players refuse to perform for Beamen and consequently lose a home game. After Beamen gets into a brawl with Julian \"J-Man\" Washington ([[LL Cool J]]), an irate D'Amato expresses his embarrassment at his team before leaving. Beamen contemplates and amends his self-centered behavior.\n\nAs the playoffs come around, Sharks [[middle linebacker]] Luther Lavay ([[Lawrence Taylor]]) reminds Beamen how lucky he is to be in the league and to find a life outside of football; his words fall on deaf ears. D'Amato worsens his relationship with Pagniacci and berates Rooney for second-guessing his availability. Before the game, D'Amato gives a speech urging team unity that Beamen takes to heart. Rooney returns as starting quarterback, but is injured with a [[concussion]] after scoring a [[touchdown]]. Rooney and Pagniacci urge D'Amato to let Beamen finish the game, which after an argument he allows. Beamen apologizes to his teammates for his actions and leads the team to win. He dedicates the next game to Rooney.\n\nThe Sharks eventually lose the championship final known as Pantheon Cup to San Francisco. At D'Amato's final press conference as head coach, he is thanked by Pagniacci. D'Amato is expected to announce his retirement, but he instead drops a bombshell and announces that he has been hired as head coach and general manager of an [[expansion team]] in [[New Mexico]], the Albuquerque Aztecs. He further infuriates Pagniacci by adding that he has signed Beamen to be his starting quarterback and [[franchise player]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://actionmoviesreviews.tumblr.com/ |title=Action Movies Reviews |publisher=Actionmoviesreviews.tumblr.com |date= |accessdate=2017-04-20}}</ref>\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Al Pacino]] as Anthony \"Tony\" D'Amato, [[head coach]] of the Miami Sharks. Having held his position for decades and been given much autonomy by the team's owner, \"Tony D\" is respected for great successes, including two Pantheon Cups, the championship for this (fictional) professional football league. He devoted so much time to the team, he became estranged from his wife and children. D'Amato's traditional methods have come under fire from management and the media for recent failures, including missing the playoffs. Bitter that he was never promoted to general manager, D'Amato resents the hands-on \"interference\" of Christina Pagniacci, who succeeded her father Arturo as team owner. D'Amato's character was partly inspired by [[Tom Landry]], longtime coach of the [[Dallas Cowboys]]. His last name comes from legendary boxing trainer [[Constantine \"Cus\" D'Amato]].<ref name=\"filmblather1\">{{cite web|author=Euegene Novikov |url=http://filmblather.com/films/anygivensunday/ |title=Any Given Sunday |publisher=Film Blather |date= |accessdate=2012-01-29}}</ref>\n*[[Cameron Diaz]] as Christina Pagniacci, owner and [[General manager (sports)|general manager]]. She inherited the team from her father and boasts a [[Samuel Curtis Johnson Graduate School of Management#MBA program|Cornell MBA]]. She attributes the team's disappointments to Coach D'Amato's \"old-school methods\" and takes a more hands-on approach, bringing in innovative new [[offensive coordinator]] Nick Crozier as his eventual successor. She hints that D'Amato will not return after his contract expires, adding to his distractions. She also threatens to move the franchise if the city refuses to build a new stadium, causing a confrontation with the AFFA Commissioner and the [[Mayor of Miami]].<ref name=\"filmblather1\"/> Her character is based upon [[Jerry Jones]] and [[Georgia Frontiere]].\n*[[Dennis Quaid]] as Jack \"Cap\" Rooney, starting [[quarterback]] and team captain. Seen as being like a son to D'Amato, the two have been credited with the team's greatest on-field successes. Rooney is now an aging veteran who faces injuries and conflicts with team personnel. Pagniacci wants to dump him. Relations have soured between Rooney and wife Cindy ([[Lauren Holly]]), who goads him without sympathy for his physical or mental situation, mercilessly browbeating him when he even mentions retiring. He is injured during a game and is replaced, but is determined to make a comeback. Rooney recovers in time for the first round of the playoffs, wherein he plays well until suffering a hard hit while scoring a touchdown before halftime.<ref name=\"filmblather1\"/>\n*[[James Woods]] as Dr. Harvey Mandrake, the unscrupulous team physician. He risks serious injury to players to enable the team to have a better shot at winning, often at the direction of Pagniacci. He is later fired after his unethical methods are discovered by the conscientious team [[internist]].<ref name=\"filmblather1\"/>\n*[[Jamie Foxx]] as \"Steamin\" Willie Beamen, the third-string quarterback. Beamen has a history that eventually led him to distrust his coaches. In particular, while playing for San Diego, Beamen was made into a defensive secondary player for having \"fast feet\" and was eventually injured while making a tackle. Beamen initially believes that [[racism]] played a major role in his history of being denied opportunities he desired, using an alternative of \"placeism\" to describe a lack of African-American quarterbacks and head coaches in pro football. He takes over as starter after injuries to Rooney and the backup quarterback. Though surprisingly successful, Beamen causes tension among staff and teammates. He frequently changes the plays the coach calls, or just calls his own. These acts create major tension with D'Amato. D'Amato respects Beamen's athletic ability and acknowledges his talents warrant him to be a quarterback, but heavily criticizes his lack of leadership skills and intangibles. He is granted his own music video and even asks owner Pagniacci for a date when she enters a postgame locker room full of naked or partly dressed players like himself. Beamen's antics on and off the field eventually get him demoted to the bench by D'Amato, who firmly believes that a quarterback's most important role is to lead the team and help keep them confident, both of which Beamen took a clear disregard for. Beamen later matures and is inspired by \"Cap\" Rooney's gutsy performance in the Sharks' first playoff game.\n*[[LL Cool J]] as Julian \"J-Man\" Washington, starting [[running back]]. He is very good but becomes increasingly angry at Beamen for his cockiness and tendencies to take plays away from him. He is motivated by incentive clauses in his contract, and D'Amato refers to him as a \"merc\" (mercenary) \"who will be gone before next season.\" Washington later redeems himself to the team by running out-of-bounds in order to stop the play clock while his team was attempting an offensive drive with little time left.\n*[[Ann-Margret]] as Margaret Pagniacci, Christina's mother and the widow of the Sharks' original owner Arturo.\n*[[Lauren Holly]] as Cindy Rooney, wife of Cap Rooney. It is heavily implied that she is no more than a [[trophy wife]], caring more for her wealth and social status than for her husband's health and well being.\n*[[Lawrence Taylor]] as Luther \"Shark\" Lavay, starting [[middle linebacker]] and the captain of the defense, with a cortisone addiction and is nearing the twilight of a very successful career. Held in high esteem by D'Amato for \"revolutionizing\" his position by being highly skilled in both pass rushing and defending against the run. Mandrake has concealed that \"Shark\" is suffering from a previous injury, a broken neck that did not heal properly. If he suffers a serious hit again, he may be killed or permanently disabled. The team's internist informs him and D'Amato of the situation, but \"Shark\" says he will lose over one million dollars if he does not make his incentive stats or retires as Powers suggests. He also has a confrontation with Beamen over the role of offense vs. defense (which culminates with him cutting Beamen's [[Chevrolet Suburban]] in half with a circular saw during a party). While making a hit, Shark gets knocked unconscious. He awakens and is hauled off on a stretcher, satisfied that he made his one million dollars incentive.\n*[[Jim Brown]] as Monte Monroe, [[defensive coordinator]]. He is vocal and brings intensity to the defense and to the team in general. A longtime friend of D'Amato, who personally confides in Montezuma several times. Monroe states at one point he would like to return to high school coaching where the game is \"pure.\"\n*[[Aaron Eckhart]] as Nick Crozier, offensive coordinator. Nick is an offensive guru brought in from Minnesota by Christina Pagniacci. Young and tech-savvy (making use of a laptop computer while calling plays), he is highly critical of Tony's old-fashioned ways, as well as Beamen's changing the plays in the huddle and Julian's playing for contract incentives. Despite the tension, D'Amato recognizes Crozier's talent. He is named D'Amato's successor after the coach departs to lead an expansion franchise in New Mexico.\n*[[Bill Bellamy]] as Jimmy Sanderson, the Wide Receiver who becomes Willie Beamen's first option on offense once he is moved into the starting Quarterback position, adding to the friction already building up between Willie and Julian.\n*[[Matthew Modine]] as Dr. Oliver \"Ollie\" Powers, the team's internist. He discovers Dr. Mandrake covering for players who are suffering from near-career-ending injuries but are overdosing on painkillers, steroids and hormones to cover the pain. Powers faces his own dilemma in the need to relieve the players' pain vs. prescribing too much medication at the insistence of the addicted players.\n*[[John C. McGinley]] as Jack Rose, an abrasive and prominent sports reporter. On his own cable show, Rose displays an incredible distaste for all things D'Amato. This leads to D'Amato physically assaulting Rose near the end of the regular season, but no charges are pressed after D'Amato makes a public apology. In spite of their rivalry (or even because of it) he confesses that he will miss D'Amato when he retires. Inspired by [[Jim Rome]].\n*[[Lela Rochon]] as Vanessa Struthers, Longtime girlfriend of Willie Beaman who unsuccessfully tries to pressure him into marriage after being humiliated by Cindy Rooney in front of the other Football wives.\n*[[Elizabeth Berkley]] as Mandy Murphy\n*[[Charlton Heston]] as Commissioner\n*[[Clifton Davis]] as Mayor Tyrone Smalls\n\nDirector Oliver Stone appears uncredited as an announcer at the stadium, and his [[caricature]] portrait can be seen at a bar with other caricatures of noted sports people, including D'Amato.\n\nActor [[Jim Caviezel]] appears uncredited as D'Amato's estranged son, but the scene was cut from the theatrical release. The deleted scene is available on the DVD release.\n\n[[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] wide receiver [[Terrell Owens]] is featured in the final regular season game against the Dallas Knights catching a touchdown and scoring another touchdown on a reverse. He had no speaking lines and his first name is never said, but his last name is shown to be Owens.\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\nOliver Stone developed a script called ''Monday Night'' written by [[Jamie Williams (American football)|Jamie Williams]], a former [[tight end]] for the [[Nebraska Cornhuskers]] and later the [[San Francisco 49ers]], and [[Richard Weiner (sports journalist)|Richard Weiner]], a [[sports journalist]]. Stone separately acquired the [[spec script]] ''On Any Given Sunday'', by [[John Logan (writer)|John Logan]]. Stone later amalgamated a third screenplay, ''Playing Hurt'' by [[Daniel Pyne]], into the project.\n\nAs of May 1, 1999, the screenplay's cover page listed the following writers: original draft by Jamie Williams & Richard Weiner, John Logan, Daniel Pyne; subsequent revisions by [[Gary Ross]]; revisions by [[Raynold Gideon]] & [[Bruce A. Evans]]; revisions by John Logan; revisions by Lisa Amsterdam & [[Robert Huizenga]]; latest revisions by Oliver Stone.\n\nThe [[Writers Guild of America]] ultimately awarded screenplay credit to Logan and Stone, with \"story\" credit to Pyne and Logan. Williams and Weiner went uncredited for their original screenplay, but were credited for their work on the film as technical consultants.\n\nThe screenplay was also based in part on the book ''You're Okay, It's Just a Bruise: A Doctor's Sideline Secrets'' by Robert Huizenga. Huizenga was the intern doctor for the [[History of the Los Angeles Raiders|Los Angeles Raiders]] in their 1980s heyday, working under Dr. Robert T. Rosenfeld, who dismissed many players' injuries with the phrase, \"You're okay, it's just a bruise.\" James Woods' character was based on Rosenfeld, and his first diagnosis of \"Cap\" Rooney's career-threatening injury at the beginning of the film is \"you're okay, it's just a bruise.\" Huizenga left the Raiders in the early 1990s, disgusted at the way the medical advice was kept from players and Rosenfeld being allowed to continue treating them after several mishaps, one of which is closely mirrored in the film\u2014Shark's neck injury and risk of sudden death, based on the real-life [[Mike Harden]] case.\n\n===Casting===\nDirector Oliver Stone's first two choices to play Tony D'Amato were Al Pacino and [[Robert De Niro]]. [[Henry Rollins]] was offered a role as a football player but turned it down as he felt he did not have the size to make the portrayal believable. [[Sean Combs|Sean \"P. Diddy\" Combs]] was cast as Willie Beamen, but dropped out amidst rumors he could not throw a football convincingly. Publicly Combs dropped off the project because of scheduling conflicts with his recording career. According to [[Cuba Gooding Jr.]], he met with Oliver Stone about playing the role of Willie Beamen but Stone turned Gooding down because he had already played a football player in ''[[Jerry Maguire]]'' (1996). [[Chris Tucker]] turned down the role of Willie Beamen.\n\nFive Pro Football Hall of Fame Players made cameo appearances as opposing head coaches. [[Bob St. Clair]] appears as the coach for Minnesota in the first game. [[Y. A. Tittle]], for Chicago, the second game. [[Dick Butkus]], with California, the road game. [[Warren Moon]], with New York in the rain soaked game. For the final game in Dallas, [[Johnny Unitas]] appears as the coach.\n\n[[Jim Caviezel]] played Tony D'Amato's estranged son, but his scenes were cut.

[[Texas Stadium]] is used for the home of the fictitious Dallas Knights.\n\nDirector Oliver Stone requested, but did not receive, the [[National Football League]]'s permission to use real NFL team logos and stadiums for the film. As a result, the fictional Associated Football Franchises of America (AFFA) was created (not to be confused with the real [[American Football Association (1979\u20131982)|AFA]]). The AFFA apparently exists alongside the [[National Football League|NFL]], since the [[Miami Dolphins]] are mentioned.\n\nFor the scenes during a football game, production asked local schools to participate as extras for the film, including Lake Stevens Middle School in Miami, Florida. For each shot the crowd was asked to move around so that each section looked filled. In empty seats cardboard cutouts were placed in seats with balloons attached to them so that they would seem in motion.\n\nOn [[Google Earth]], using the \"historical imagery\" button and setting the date to 2/20/1999, the Orange Bowl displays \"Sharks\" at each end zone.\n\nFor the practice scenes they used the baseball arena [[Homestead Sports Complex]].\n\nThe film also used [[Arena Football League]] players such [[Pat O'Hara]], who played for the [[Tampa Bay Storm]], later coached the [[Orlando Predators]] and is now an assistant coach with the [[Tennessee Titans]], and [[Connell Maynor]], who also played for the Orlando Predators and spent time as both a player and coach for the [[Philadelphia Soul]].

''Any Given Sunday'' explodes that theory, and not just because of the incredible intensity of its gridiron action. Oliver Stone's best movie in many years\u2014and one of his finest ever\u2014looks at the world of professional football from almost every conceivable angle, but it never tries to be the definitive statement on the subject.

Pacino has some nice heart-to-hearts with Quaid and Foxx, and the psychology of the veteran coach is well-captured in the screenplay by Stone and John Logan.

Due to the packaging listing \"6 minutes of previously unseen footage\" and a running time of 156 minutes, many assumed that the theatrical cut was 150 minutes, and that Stone had added six minutes of footage. In actuality, the theatrical cut ran 162 minutes; 12 minutes were deleted for the director's cut, and six minutes of new footage were added. Stone said these changes were made to help with the film's pacing.

The film features an [[ensemble cast]], including [[Al Pacino]], [[Cameron Diaz]], [[Dennis Quaid]], [[Jamie Foxx]], [[James Woods]], [[LL Cool J]], [[Ann-Margret]], [[Lauren Holly]], [[Matthew Modine]], [[John C. McGinley]], [[Charlton Heston]], [[Bill Bellamy]], [[Lela Rochon]], [[Aaron Eckhart]], [[Elizabeth Berkley]], [[The Boogeyman (wrestler)|Marty Wright]], and  NFL players [[Jim Brown]] and [[Lawrence Taylor]]. It is partly based on the novel ''On Any Given Sunday'' by famed NFL defensive end [[Pat Toomay]]; the title is derived from a line in the book (also used in the film) that a team can win or lose on \"any given Sunday\", said by the fictitious coach Tony D'Amato.\n\nCameo roles also featured many former American football players including [[Dick Butkus]], [[Y. A. Tittle]], [[Pat Toomay]], [[Warren Moon]], [[Johnny Unitas]], [[Ricky Watters]], [[Emmitt Smith]] and [[Terrell Owens]], as well as coach [[Barry Switzer]].\n\n==Plot==\n\nThe Miami Sharks, a once-great [[American football]] team, are struggling to make the 2001 Associated Football Franchises of America (AFFA) [[playoffs]]. They are coached by thirty-year veteran Tony D'Amato ([[Al Pacino]]), who has fallen out of favor with young team owner Christina Pagniacci ([[Cameron Diaz]]) and [[offensive coordinator]] and D'Amato's expected successor Nick Crozier ([[Aaron Eckhart]]). In the thirteenth game of the season, both [[starting quarterback]] Jack \"Cap\" Rooney ([[Dennis Quaid]]) and second-string quarterback Tyler Cherubini ([[Pat O'Hara]]) are injured and forced to leave the field. The desperate Sharks call upon third-string quarterback Willie Beamen ([[Jamie Foxx]]) to replace them. Beamen played college ball at the University of Houston. While a nervous Beamen makes a number of errors and fails to win the game for the Sharks, he plays well and gains confidence. Rooney vows to make it back by the playoffs, with D'Amato promising to not give up on him.\n\nThe next day, D'Amato and Pagniacci argue about the direction of the team. Pagniacci favors Crozier and wants to eventually cut Rooney. D'Amato argues that Pagniacci's father, the previous owner, would never meddle in his coaching plans. During the next game, to D'Amato's chagrin, Beamen disregards the team's conservative [[offense (sports)|offense]] and changes plays in the huddle. As the media hails Beamen as the next model of quarterback, the new-found success feeds his growing [[narcissism]] and leads to tension with teammates and coaches. During a confrontation with Beamen, D'Amato [[demotion|demotes]] him back to the bench. After Beamen gives an interview taking sole credit for the Sharks' winning streak, the other players refuse to perform for Beamen and consequently lose a home game. After Beamen gets into a brawl with Julian \"J-Man\" Washington ([[LL Cool J]]), an irate D'Amato expresses his embarrassment at his team before leaving. Beamen contemplates and amends his self-centered behavior.\n\nAs the playoffs come around, Sharks [[middle linebacker]] Luther Lavay ([[Lawrence Taylor]]) reminds Beamen how lucky he is to be in the league and to find a life outside of football; his words fall on deaf ears. D'Amato worsens his relationship with Pagniacci and berates Rooney for second-guessing his availability. Before the game, D'Amato gives a speech urging team unity that Beamen takes to heart. Rooney returns as starting quarterback, but is injured with a [[concussion]] after scoring a [[touchdown]]. Rooney and Pagniacci urge D'Amato to let Beamen finish the game, which after an argument he allows. Beamen apologizes to his teammates for his actions and leads the team to win. He dedicates the next game to Rooney.\n\nThe Sharks eventually lose the championship final known as Pantheon Cup to San Francisco. At D'Amato's final press conference as head coach, he is thanked by Pagniacci. D'Amato is expected to announce his retirement, but he instead drops a bombshell and announces that he has been hired as head coach and general manager of an [[expansion team]] in [[New Mexico]], the Albuquerque Aztecs. He further infuriates Pagniacci by adding that he has signed Beamen to be his starting quarterback and [[franchise player]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://actionmoviesreviews.tumblr.com/ |title=Action Movies Reviews |publisher=Actionmoviesreviews.tumblr.com |date= |accessdate=2017-04-20}}</ref>\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Al Pacino]] as Anthony \"Tony\" D'Amato, [[head coach]] of the Miami Sharks. Having held his position for decades and been given much autonomy by the team's owner, \"Tony D\" is respected for great successes, including two Pantheon Cups, the championship for this (fictional) professional football league. He devoted so much time to the team, he became estranged from his wife and children. D'Amato's traditional methods have come under fire from management and the media for recent failures, including missing the playoffs. Bitter that he was never promoted to general manager, D'Amato resents the hands-on \"interference\" of Christina Pagniacci, who succeeded her father Arturo as team owner. D'Amato's character was partly inspired by [[Tom Landry]], longtime coach of the [[Dallas Cowboys]]. His last name comes from legendary boxing trainer [[Constantine \"Cus\" D'Amato]].<ref name=\"filmblather1\">{{cite web|author=Euegene Novikov |url=http://filmblather.com/films/anygivensunday/ |title=Any Given Sunday |publisher=Film Blather |date= |accessdate=2012-01-29}}</ref>\n*[[Cameron Diaz]] as Christina Pagniacci, owner and [[General manager (sports)|general manager]]. She inherited the team from her father and boasts a [[Samuel Curtis Johnson Graduate School of Management#MBA program|Cornell MBA]]. She attributes the team's disappointments to Coach D'Amato's \"old-school methods\" and takes a more hands-on approach, bringing in innovative new [[offensive coordinator]] Nick Crozier as his eventual successor. She hints that D'Amato will not return after his contract expires, adding to his distractions. She also threatens to move the franchise if the city refuses to build a new stadium, causing a confrontation with the AFFA Commissioner and the [[Mayor of Miami]].<ref name=\"filmblather1\"/> Her character is based upon [[Jerry Jones]] and [[Georgia Frontiere]].\n*[[Dennis Quaid]] as Jack \"Cap\" Rooney, starting [[quarterback]] and team captain. Seen as being like a son to D'Amato, the two have been credited with the team's greatest on-field successes. Rooney is now an aging veteran who faces injuries and conflicts with team personnel. Pagniacci wants to dump him. Relations have soured between Rooney and wife Cindy ([[Lauren Holly]]), who goads him without sympathy for his physical or mental situation, mercilessly browbeating him when he even mentions retiring. He is injured during a game and is replaced, but is determined to make a comeback. Rooney recovers in time for the first round of the playoffs, wherein he plays well until suffering a hard hit while scoring a touchdown before halftime.<ref name=\"filmblather1\"/>\n*[[James Woods]] as Dr. Harvey Mandrake, the unscrupulous team physician. He risks serious injury to players to enable the team to have a better shot at winning, often at the direction of Pagniacci. He is later fired after his unethical methods are discovered by the conscientious team [[internist]].<ref name=\"filmblather1\"/>\n*[[Jamie Foxx]] as \"Steamin\" Willie Beamen, the third-string quarterback. Beamen has a history that eventually led him to distrust his coaches. In particular, while playing for San Diego, Beamen was made into a defensive secondary player for having \"fast feet\" and was eventually injured while making a tackle. Beamen initially believes that [[racism]] played a major role in his history of being denied opportunities he desired, using an alternative of \"placeism\" to describe a lack of African-American quarterbacks and head coaches in pro football. He takes over as starter after injuries to Rooney and the backup quarterback. Though surprisingly successful, Beamen causes tension among staff and teammates. He frequently changes the plays the coach calls, or just calls his own. These acts create major tension with D'Amato. D'Amato respects Beamen's athletic ability and acknowledges his talents warrant him to be a quarterback, but heavily criticizes his lack of leadership skills and intangibles. He is granted his own music video and even asks owner Pagniacci for a date when she enters a postgame locker room full of naked or partly dressed players like himself. Beamen's antics on and off the field eventually get him demoted to the bench by D'Amato, who firmly believes that a quarterback's most important role is to lead the team and help keep them confident, both of which Beamen took a clear disregard for. Beamen later matures and is inspired by \"Cap\" Rooney's gutsy performance in the Sharks' first playoff game.\n*[[LL Cool J]] as Julian \"J-Man\" Washington, starting [[running back]]. He is very good but becomes increasingly angry at Beamen for his cockiness and tendencies to take plays away from him. He is motivated by incentive clauses in his contract, and D'Amato refers to him as a \"merc\" (mercenary) \"who will be gone before next season.\" Washington later redeems himself to the team by running out-of-bounds in order to stop the play clock while his team was attempting an offensive drive with little time left.\n*[[Ann-Margret]] as Margaret Pagniacci, Christina's mother and the widow of the Sharks' original owner Arturo.\n*[[Lauren Holly]] as Cindy Rooney, wife of Cap Rooney. It is heavily implied that she is no more than a [[trophy wife]], caring more for her wealth and social status than for her husband's health and well being.\n*[[Lawrence Taylor]] as Luther \"Shark\" Lavay, starting [[middle linebacker]] and the captain of the defense, with a cortisone addiction and is nearing the twilight of a very successful career. Held in high esteem by D'Amato for \"revolutionizing\" his position by being highly skilled in both pass rushing and defending against the run. Mandrake has concealed that \"Shark\" is suffering from a previous injury, a broken neck that did not heal properly. If he suffers a serious hit again, he may be killed or permanently disabled. The team's internist informs him and D'Amato of the situation, but \"Shark\" says he will lose over one million dollars if he does not make his incentive stats or retires as Powers suggests. He also has a confrontation with Beamen over the role of offense vs. defense (which culminates with him cutting Beamen's [[Chevrolet Suburban]] in half with a circular saw during a party). While making a hit, Shark gets knocked unconscious. He awakens and is hauled off on a stretcher, satisfied that he made his one million dollars incentive.\n*[[Jim Brown]] as Monte Monroe, [[defensive coordinator]]. He is vocal and brings intensity to the defense and to the team in general. A longtime friend of D'Amato, who personally confides in Montezuma several times. Monroe states at one point he would like to return to high school coaching where the game is \"pure.\"\n*[[Aaron Eckhart]] as Nick Crozier, offensive coordinator. Nick is an offensive guru brought in from Minnesota by Christina Pagniacci. Young and tech-savvy (making use of a laptop computer while calling plays), he is highly critical of Tony's old-fashioned ways, as well as Beamen's changing the plays in the huddle and Julian's playing for contract incentives. Despite the tension, D'Amato recognizes Crozier's talent. He is named D'Amato's successor after the coach departs to lead an expansion franchise in New Mexico.\n*[[Bill Bellamy]] as Jimmy Sanderson, the Wide Receiver who becomes Willie Beamen's first option on offense once he is moved into the starting Quaterback position, adding to the friction already building up between Willie and Julian.\n*[[Matthew Modine]] as Dr. Oliver \"Ollie\" Powers, the team's internist. He discovers Dr. Mandrake covering for players who are suffering from near-career-ending injuries but are overdosing on painkillers, steroids and hormones to cover the pain. Powers faces his own dilemma in the need to relieve the players' pain vs. prescribing too much medication at the insistence of the addicted players.\n*[[John C. McGinley]] as Jack Rose, an abrasive and prominent sports reporter. On his own cable show, Rose displays an incredible distaste for all things D'Amato. This leads to D'Amato physically assaulting Rose near the end of the regular season, but no charges are pressed after D'Amato makes a public apology. In spite of their rivalry (or even because of it) he confesses that he will miss D'Amato when he retires. Inspired by [[Jim Rome]].\n*[[Lela Rochon]] as Vanessa Struthers, Longtime girlfriend of Willie Beaman who unsuccessfully tries to pressure him into marriage after being humiliated by Cindy Rooney in front of the other Football wives.\n*[[Elizabeth Berkley]] as Mandy Murphy\n*[[Charlton Heston]] as Commissioner\n*[[Clifton Davis]] as Mayor Tyrone Smalls\n\nDirector Oliver Stone appears uncredited as an announcer at the stadium, and his [[caricature]] portrait can be seen at a bar with other caricatures of noted sports people, including D'Amato.\n\nActor [[Jim Caviezel]] appears uncredited as D'Amato's estranged son, but the scene was cut from the theatrical release. The deleted scene is available on the DVD release.\n\n[[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] wide receiver [[Terrell Owens]] is featured in the final regular season game against the Dallas Knights catching a touchdown and scoring another touchdown on a reverse. He had no speaking lines and his first name is never said, but his last name is shown to be Owens.\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\nOliver Stone developed a script called ''Monday Night'' written by [[Jamie Williams (American football)|Jamie Williams]], a former [[tight end]] for the [[Nebraska Cornhuskers]] and later the [[San Francisco 49ers]], and [[Richard Weiner (sports journalist)|Richard Weiner]], a [[sports journalist]]. Stone separately acquired the [[spec script]] ''On Any Given Sunday'', by [[John Logan (writer)|John Logan]]. Stone later amalgamated a third screenplay, ''Playing Hurt'' by [[Daniel Pyne]], into the project.\n\nAs of May 1, 1999, the screenplay's cover page listed the following writers: original draft by Jamie Williams & Richard Weiner, John Logan, Daniel Pyne; subsequent revisions by [[Gary Ross]]; revisions by [[Raynold Gideon]] & [[Bruce A. Evans]]; revisions by John Logan; revisions by Lisa Amsterdam & [[Robert Huizenga]]; latest revisions by Oliver Stone.\n\nThe [[Writers Guild of America]] ultimately awarded screenplay credit to Logan and Stone, with \"story\" credit to Pyne and Logan. Williams and Weiner went uncredited for their original screenplay, but were credited for their work on the film as technical consultants.\n\nThe screenplay was also based in part on the book ''You're Okay, It's Just a Bruise: A Doctor's Sideline Secrets'' by Robert Huizenga. Huizenga was the intern doctor for the [[History of the Los Angeles Raiders|Los Angeles Raiders]] in their 1980s heyday, working under Dr. Robert T. Rosenfeld, who dismissed many players' injuries with the phrase, \"You're okay, it's just a bruise.\" James Woods' character was based on Rosenfeld, and his first diagnosis of \"Cap\" Rooney's career-threatening injury at the beginning of the film is \"you're okay, it's just a bruise.\" Huizenga left the Raiders in the early 1990s, disgusted at the way the medical advice was kept from players and Rosenfeld being allowed to continue treating them after several mishaps, one of which is closely mirrored in the film\u2014Shark's neck injury and risk of sudden death, based on the real-life [[Mike Harden]] case.\n\n===Casting===\nDirector Oliver Stone's first two choices to play Tony D'Amato were Al Pacino and [[Robert De Niro]]. [[Henry Rollins]] was offered a role as a football player but turned it down as he felt he did not have the size to make the portrayal believable. [[Sean Combs|Sean \"P. Diddy\" Combs]] was cast as Willie Beamen, but dropped out amidst rumors he could not throw a football convincingly. Publicly Combs dropped off the project because of scheduling conflicts with his recording career. According to [[Cuba Gooding Jr.]], he met with Oliver Stone about playing the role of Willie Beamen but Stone turned Gooding down because he had already played a football player in ''[[Jerry Maguire]]'' (1996). [[Chris Tucker]] turned down the role of Willie Beamen.\n\nFive Pro Football Hall of Fame Players made cameo appearances as opposing head coaches. [[Bob St. Clair]] appears as the coach for Minnesota in the first game. [[Y. A. Tittle]], for Chicago, the second game. [[Dick Butkus]], with California, the road game. [[Warren Moon]], with New York in the rain soaked game. For the final game in Dallas, [[Johnny Unitas]] appears as the coach.\n\n[[Jim Caviezel]] played Tony D'Amato's estranged son, but his scenes were cut. They can be seen in the extras of the Oliver Stone Collection DVD. [[Tom Sizemore]] also had a role in the film, but it too was cut.\n\n===Principal photography===\nThe film was shot in [[Miami, Florida]] and [[Irving, Texas]]. Miami's [[Miami Orange Bowl|Orange Bowl]] stadium represents the home of the fictitious American football team, the Miami Sharks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.misterhabs.com/TV_movie.htm |title=Television & Film Helmets |publisher=Misterhabs.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://mghelmets.com/movies.html |title=Movie/TV helmets |publisher=Mghelmets.com |accessdate=2012-04-09 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714081535/http://mghelmets.com/movies.html |archivedate=2011-07-14 }}</ref> When the team traveled to California, the stadium used was [[Hard Rock Stadium|Pro Player Stadium]], which is located in Miami Gardens. [[Texas Stadium]] is used for the home of the fictitious Dallas Knights.\n\nDirector Oliver Stone requested, but did not receive, the [[National Football League]]'s permission to use real NFL team logos and stadiums for the film. As a result, the fictional Associated Football Franchises of America (AFFA) was created (not to be confused with the real [[American Football Association (1979\u20131982)|AFA]]). The AFFA apparently exists alongside the [[National Football League|NFL]], since the [[Miami Dolphins]] are mentioned.\n\nFor the scenes during a football game, production asked local schools to participate as extras for the film, including Lake Stevens Middle School in Miami, Florida. For each shot the crowd was asked to move around so that each section looked filled. In empty seats cardboard cutouts were placed in seats with balloons attached to them so that they would seem in motion.\n\nOn [[Google Earth]], using the \"historical imagery\" button and setting the date to 2/20/1999, the Orange Bowl displays \"Sharks\" at each end zone.\n\nFor the practice scenes they used the baseball arena [[Homestead Sports Complex]].\n\nThe film also used [[Arena Football League]] players such [[Pat O'Hara]], who played for the [[Tampa Bay Storm]], later coached the [[Orlando Predators]] and is now an assistant coach with the [[Tennessee Titans]], and [[Connell Maynor]], who also played for the Orlando Predators and spent time as both a player and coach for the [[Philadelphia Soul]]. [[Bjorn Nittmo]], then with the AFL's [[Buffalo Destroyers]], was the Sharks' placekicker. Matt Martinez, a former Gurkha & ex-husband of [[Niki Taylor]] and linebacker for the AFL's [[Miami Hooters]], played himself, #31 for the Sharks.\n\nA scene in the film was shot at Windmill Ranch. Quaid's character's house is really Dolphins quarterback [[Dan Marino]]'s house.\n\n==Release==\n\n===Box office===\n''Any Given Sunday'' was a financial success; made on a budget of $55 million, it went on to earn  $100.2 million worldwide.<ref name=\"boxofficemojo.com\"/>\n\n===Reception===\n\n''[[Time Out New York]]'' 's [[Andrew Johnston (critic)|Andrew Johnston]] wrote: \"It's often been said of films about sports that smaller balls equal better movies.

A surprisingly balanced film that merges Stone's hyperkinetic style with a character-centric narrative approach reminiscent of John Sayles and Robert Altman at their best, ''Sunday'' proves that powerful human drama and MTV visual pyrotechnics actually can coexist after all.\"<ref>Time Out New York, Dec. 30, 1999-Jan. 6, 2000, p. 87</ref>\n\n[[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' also gave the film a mostly positive review, awarding it 3 out of 4 stars, but criticized its length: \"I guess I recommend the movie because the dramatic scenes are worth it. Pacino has some nice heart-to-hearts with Quaid and Foxx, and the psychology of the veteran coach is well-captured in the screenplay by Stone and John Logan. But if some studio executive came along and made Stone cut his movie down to two hours, I have the strangest feeling it wouldn't lose much of substance and might even play better.\"<ref>[https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/any-given-sunday-1999 ANY GIVEN SUNDAY] ''Rogerebert.com'', Retrieved May 21, 2019</ref>\n\nConversely, [[Richard Schickel]] of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' criticized the story as being \"standard\" and stated \"(a)lmost three hours of this jitter deteriorates from bravura filmmaking to annoying mannerism, and Any Given Sunday ends up less than the sum of its many, often interesting parts.\"<ref name=\"rottentomatoes.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/any_given_sunday/reviews/?type=top_critics|title=Any Given Sunday - Movie Reviews - Rotten Tomatoes|website=www.rottentomatoes.com}}</ref> Rick Groen of ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' wrote that the story was \"(c)hoc-a-bloc with manly blather about sacrifice and honour and rugged individuals pulling together for the greater glory of the team.\"<ref name=\"rottentomatoes.com\"/> And, elaborating on many critics' shared observations<ref name=\"rottentomatoes.com\"/> that the movie was \"hyperkinetic\", Jack Matthews of the ''[[Daily News (New York)|New York Daily News]]'' states that \"the sensation we get from the blizzard of images and teeth-jarring sound effects is of having our head used as the football.\"\n\nThe film received an aggregated score of 52% from 122 reviews on [[Rotten Tomatoes]].<ref>[https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/any_given_sunday/ \"Any Given Sunday\"].

It peaked at #28 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and #11 on the [[Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums]].\n\nOliver Stone wanted to use the music of the Canadian band [[Godspeed You! Black Emperor]] and actually filmed a scene using their music; when he later asked for permission the band said no, and Stone was forced to redo the scene without the music.\n\nFilm composer [[Richard Horowitz]], who supplied the original score, published his complete music for the film on a promotional CD.<ref>RHCD 01, 1999 ([http://soundtrackcollector.com/catalog/soundtrackdetail.php?movieid=10200 ''Any Given Sunday''] at soundtrackcollector.com).</ref>\n\n===Director's cut===\nWhen released to home video on VHS and DVD, a new [[director's cut]] by Oliver Stone was used. Due to the packaging listing \"6 minutes of previously unseen footage\" and a running time of 156 minutes, many assumed that the theatrical cut was 150 minutes, and that Stone had added six minutes of footage. In actuality, the theatrical cut ran 162 minutes; 12 minutes were deleted for the director's cut, and six minutes of new footage were added. Stone said these changes were made to help with the film's pacing. The differences between the two versions are discussed on [[IMDb]]'s entry for the film.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0146838/alternateversions |title=Any Given Sunday (1999) - Alternate versions |work=Imdb.com |date= |accessdate=2008-11-28}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote}}\n* {{IMDb title|id=0146838|title=Any Given Sunday}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes|id=any_given_sunday|title=Any Given Sunday}}\n\n{{Oliver Stone}}\n{{John Logan}}\n\n[[Category:1999 films]]\n[[Category:1990s sports drama films]]\n[[Category:American films]]\n[[Category:American sports drama films]]\n[[Category:American football films]]\n[[Category:English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films set in Miami]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Texas]]\n[[Category:Warner Bros. films]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Lauren Shuler Donner]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Oliver Stone]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by John Logan]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Oliver Stone]]\n", "name_user": "CPM006", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Any_Given_Sunday"}

HDR images can also be acquired using special [[Image sensor|image sensors]], such as an [[oversampled binary image sensor]].\n\nDue to the limitations of printing and [[display contrast]], the extended luminosity range of input HDR images has to be compressed to be made visible. The method of rendering an HDR image to a standard monitor or printing device is called [[tone mapping]]. This method reduces the overall contrast of an HDR image to facilitate display on devices or printouts with lower dynamic range, and can be applied to produce images with preserved local contrast (or exaggerated for artistic effect).\n\n\"HDR\" may refer to the overall process, to the HDR imaging process, or to HDR imaging represented on a low dynamic range display such as a screen or standard .jpg image.\n\n\n== Emulating the human vision system==\nOne aim of HDR is to present a similar range of [[luminance]] to that experienced through the human [[visual system]]. The human eye, through non-linear response, [[adaptation (eye)|adaptation]] of the [[Iris (anatomy)|iris]] and other methods, adjusts constantly to adapt to a broad range of luminance present in the environment. The brain continuously interprets this information so that a viewer can see in a wide range of light conditions.\n\nStandard photographic and image techniques allow differentiation only within a certain range of brightness. Outside of this range, no features are visible because there is no differentiation in bright areas as everything appears just pure white, and there is no differentiation in darker areas as everything appears pure black.  Non-HDR cameras take photographs with a limited exposure range, referred to as low dynamic range (LDR), resulting in the loss of detail in highlights or [[shadow#Photography|shadows]].\n\n== Photography ==\n\n{|class=\"wikitable unsortable floatright\"\n|+ '''Dynamic ranges of common devices'''\n|-\n!

An increase of one EV, or 'one stop', represents a doubling of the amount of light. Conversely, a decrease of one EV represents a halving of the amount of light. Therefore, revealing detail in the darkest of shadows requires high exposures, while preserving detail in very bright situations requires very low exposures. Most cameras cannot provide this range of exposure values within a single exposure, due to their low dynamic range.\nHigh-dynamic-range photographs are generally achieved by capturing multiple standard-exposure images, often using [[Bracketing#Exposure bracketing|exposure bracketing]], and then later [[Exposure fusion|merging them]] into a single HDR image, usually within a [[photo manipulation]] program.\n\nAny camera that allows manual exposure control can make images for HDR work, although one equipped with [[Autobracketing|auto exposure bracketing (AEB)]] is far better suited. Images from film cameras are less suitable as they often must first be digitized, so that they can later be processed using software HDR methods.\n\nIn most imaging devices, the degree of exposure to light applied to the active element (be it film or [[Charge-coupled device|CCD]]) can be altered in one of two ways: by either increasing/decreasing the size of the [[aperture]] or by increasing/decreasing the time of each [[exposure (photography)|exposure]]. Exposure variation in an HDR set is only done by altering the '''exposure time''' and ''not'' the aperture size; this is because altering the aperture size also affects the [[depth of field]] and so the resultant multiple images would be quite different, preventing their final combination into a single HDR image.\n\nAn important limitation for HDR photography is that any movement between successive images will impede or prevent success in combining them afterward. Also, as one must create several images (often three or five and sometimes more) to obtain the desired [[luminance]] range, such a full 'set' of images takes extra time. HDR photographers have developed calculation methods and techniques to partially overcome these problems, but the use of a sturdy tripod is, at least, advised.\n\nSome cameras have an [[Autobracketing|auto exposure bracketing (AEB)]] feature with a far greater dynamic range than others, from the 3 EV of the [[Canon EOS 40D]], to the 18 EV of the [[Canon EOS-1D Mark II]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Auto Exposure Bracketing by camera model |url=http://hdr-photography.com/aeb.html |accessdate=18 August 2009}}</ref> As the popularity of this imaging method grows, several camera manufacturers are now offering built-in HDR features.

Although it is a distinct operation, tone mapping is often applied to HDRI files by the same software package.\n\nSeveral software applications are available on the PC, Mac and Linux platforms for producing HDR files and tone mapped images. Notable titles include\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Adobe Photoshop]]\n* [[Aurora HDR]]\n* [[Dynamic Photo HDR]]\n* [[EasyHDR]]\n* [[GIMP]]\n* [[Nik Collection|HDR Efex Pro]]\n* [[HDR PhotoStudio]]\n* [[Luminance HDR]]\n* [[MagicRaw]]\n* [[Oloneo PhotoEngine]]\n* [[PTGui]]\n* [[Affinity Photo]]\n* [[SNS-HDR]]\n*[[HDRSoft - Photomatix]]{{Div col end}}\n\n=== Comparison with traditional digital images ===\nInformation stored in high-dynamic-range images typically corresponds to the physical values of [[luminance]] or [[radiance]] that can be observed in the real world. This is different from traditional [[digital images]], which represent colors as they should appear on a monitor or a paper print. Therefore, HDR image formats are often called ''scene-referred'', in contrast to traditional digital images, which are ''device-referred'' or ''output-referred''. Furthermore, traditional images are usually encoded for the human [[visual system]] (maximizing the visual information stored in the fixed number of bits), which is usually called ''gamma encoding'' or ''[[gamma correction]]''. The values stored for HDR images are often [[gamma correction|gamma compressed]] ([[power law]]) or [[logarithm]]ically encoded, or [[floating point|floating-point]] linear values, since [[fixed-point arithmetic|fixed-point]] linear encodings are increasingly inefficient over higher dynamic ranges.<ref name=gregward/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/refer/Notes/picture_format.html |accessdate=2009-08-21 |title=The Radiance Picture File Format}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Fernando |first=Randima |title=GPU Gems |publisher=Addison-Wesley |location=Boston |year=2004 |chapter=26.5 Linear Pixel Values |url=http://http.developer.nvidia.com/GPUGems/gpugems_ch26.html |isbn=0-321-22832-4 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100412001848/http://http.developer.nvidia.com/GPUGems/gpugems_ch26.html |archivedate=2010-04-12 }}</ref>\n\nHDR images often don't use fixed ranges per color [[channel (digital image)|channel]]\u2014other than traditional images\u2014to represent many more colors over a much wider dynamic range. For that purpose, they do not use integer values to represent the single color channels (e.g., 0-255 in an 8 bit per pixel interval for red, green and blue) but instead use a floating point representation. Common are 16-bit (''[[half precision]]'') or 32-bit [[floating point]] numbers to represent HDR pixels. However, when the appropriate [[transfer function]] is used, HDR pixels for some applications can be represented with a [[color depth]] that has as few as 10\u201312&nbsp;bits for luminance and 8&nbsp;bits for [[chrominance]] without introducing any visible quantization artifacts.<ref name=gregward>{{cite web |url=http://www.anyhere.com/gward/hdrenc/hdr_encodings.html |title=High Dynamic Range Image Encodings |author1=Greg Ward |author2=Anyhere Software }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mpi-sb.mpg.de/resources/hdrvideo/ |title=Perception-motivated High Dynamic Range Video Encoding |author=[[Max Planck Institute for Computer Science]]}}</ref>\n\n== History of HDR photography ==\n\n=== Mid 19th century ===\n[[File:Gustave Le Gray - Brig upon the Water - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.2|An 1856 photo by [[Gustave Le Gray]]]]\nThe idea of using several exposures to adequately reproduce a too-extreme range of [[luminance]] was pioneered as early as the 1850s by [[Gustave Le Gray]] to render seascapes showing both the sky and the sea. Such rendering was impossible at the time using standard methods, as the luminosity range was too extreme. Le Gray used one negative for the sky, and another one with a longer exposure for the sea, and combined the two into one picture in positive.<ref name=GettyExh>[[J. Paul Getty Museum]].

This was effective because the dynamic range of the negative is significantly higher than would be available on the finished positive paper print when that is exposed via the negative in a uniform manner. An excellent example is the photograph ''Schweitzer at the Lamp'' by [[W. Eugene Smith]], from his 1954 [[photo essay]] ''A Man of Mercy'' on Dr. [[Albert Schweitzer]] and his humanitarian work in French Equatorial Africa.

Many of his famous prints were manipulated in the darkroom with these two methods. Adams wrote a comprehensive book on producing prints called ''The Print,'' which prominently features dodging and burning, in the context of his [[Zone System]].\n\nWith the advent of color photography, tone mapping in the darkroom was no longer possible due to the specific timing needed during the developing process of color film. Photographers looked to film manufacturers to design new film stocks with improved response, or continued to shoot in black and white to use tone mapping methods.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n\n[[File:Wyckoff HDR Curve.tif|thumb|left|upright=2.4|Exposure/Density Characteristics of Wyckoff's Extended Exposure Response Film]]\nColor film capable of directly recording high-dynamic-range images was developed by [[Charles Wyckoff]] and [[EG&G]] \"in the course of a contract with the Department of the Air Force\".<ref>{{cite patent | inventor-last = Wyckoff | inventor-first = Charles W.\n | inventorlink = Charles Wyckoff | inventor2-last = EG&G Inc., assignee | inventor2-first = | inventorlink2 = EG&G | publication-date = March 24, 1961 | issue-date = June 17, 1969 | title = Silver Halide Photographic Film having Increased Exposure-response Characteristics | country-code = US | description = | patent-number = 3450536 | url = http://www.google.com/patents?hl=en&lr=&vid=USPAT3450536&id=43RzAAAAEBAJ&oi=fnd&dq=%22Extended+exposure%22+Wyckoff&printsec=abstract#v=onepage&q=%22Extended%20exposure%22%20Wyckoff&f=false | accessdate = June 1, 2012}}</ref> This XR film had three [[Photographic emulsion|emulsion]] layers, an upper layer having an [[Film speed#ASA|ASA]] speed rating of 400, a middle layer with an intermediate rating, and a lower layer with an ASA rating of 0.004.

HDR images can also be acquired using special [[Image sensor|image sensors]], such as an [[oversampled binary image sensor]].\n\nDue to the limitations of printing and [[display contrast]], the extended luminosity range of input HDR images has to be compressed to be made visible. The method of rendering an HDR image to a standard monitor or printing device is called [[tone mapping]]. This method reduces the overall contrast of an HDR image to facilitate display on devices or printouts with lower dynamic range, and can be applied to produce images with preserved local contrast (or exaggerated for artistic effect).\n\n\"HDR\" may refer to the overall process, to the HDR imaging process, or to HDR imaging represented on a low dynamic range display such as a screen or standard .jpg image.\n\n\n== Emulating the human vision system==\nOne aim of HDR is to present a similar range of [[luminance]] to that experienced through the human [[visual system]]. The human eye, through non-linear response, [[adaptation (eye)|adaptation]] of the [[Iris (anatomy)|iris]] and other methods, adjusts constantly to adapt to a broad range of luminance present in the environment. The brain continuously interprets this information so that a viewer can see in a wide range of light conditions.\n\nStandard photographic and image techniques allow differentiation only within a certain range of brightness. Outside of this range, no features are visible because there is no differentiation in bright areas as everything appears just pure white, and there is no differentiation in darker areas as everything appears pure black.  Non-HDR cameras take photographs with a limited exposure range, referred to as low dynamic range (LDR), resulting in the loss of detail in highlights or [[shadow#Photography|shadows]].\n\n== Photography ==\n\n{|class=\"wikitable unsortable floatright\"\n|+ '''Dynamic ranges of common devices'''\n|-\n!

An increase of one EV, or 'one stop', represents a doubling of the amount of light. Conversely, a decrease of one EV represents a halving of the amount of light. Therefore, revealing detail in the darkest of shadows requires high exposures, while preserving detail in very bright situations requires very low exposures. Most cameras cannot provide this range of exposure values within a single exposure, due to their low dynamic range.\nHigh-dynamic-range photographs are generally achieved by capturing multiple standard-exposure images, often using [[Bracketing#Exposure bracketing|exposure bracketing]], and then later [[Exposure fusion|merging them]] into a single HDR image, usually within a [[photo manipulation]] program.\n\nAny camera that allows manual exposure control can make images for HDR work, although one equipped with [[Autobracketing|auto exposure bracketing (AEB)]] is far better suited. Images from film cameras are less suitable as they often must first be digitized, so that they can later be processed using software HDR methods.\n\nIn most imaging devices, the degree of exposure to light applied to the active element (be it film or [[Charge-coupled device|CCD]]) can be altered in one of two ways: by either increasing/decreasing the size of the [[aperture]] or by increasing/decreasing the time of each [[exposure (photography)|exposure]]. Exposure variation in an HDR set is only done by altering the '''exposure time''' and ''not'' the aperture size; this is because altering the aperture size also affects the [[depth of field]] and so the resultant multiple images would be quite different, preventing their final combination into a single HDR image.\n\nAn important limitation for HDR photography is that any movement between successive images will impede or prevent success in combining them afterward. Also, as one must create several images (often three or five and sometimes more) to obtain the desired [[luminance]] range, such a full 'set' of images takes extra time. HDR photographers have developed calculation methods and techniques to partially overcome these problems, but the use of a sturdy tripod is, at least, advised.\n\nSome cameras have an [[Autobracketing|auto exposure bracketing (AEB)]] feature with a far greater dynamic range than others, from the 3 EV of the [[Canon EOS 40D]], to the 18 EV of the [[Canon EOS-1D Mark II]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Auto Exposure Bracketing by camera model |url=http://hdr-photography.com/aeb.html |accessdate=18 August 2009}}</ref> As the popularity of this imaging method grows, several camera manufacturers are now offering built-in HDR features.

Although it is a distinct operation, tone mapping is often applied to HDRI files by the same software package.\n\nSeveral software applications are available on the PC, Mac and Linux platforms for producing HDR files and tone mapped images. Notable titles include\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Adobe Photoshop]]\n* [[Aurora HDR]]\n* [[Dynamic Photo HDR]]\n* [[EasyHDR]]\n* [[GIMP]]\n* [[Nik Collection|HDR Efex Pro]]\n* [[HDR PhotoStudio]]\n* [[Luminance HDR]]\n* [[MagicRaw]]\n* [[Oloneo PhotoEngine]]\n* [[PTGui]]\n* [[Affinity Photo]]\n* [[SNS-HDR]]\n*[[HDRSoft - Photomatix]]{{Div col end}}\n\n=== Comparison with traditional digital images ===\nInformation stored in high-dynamic-range images typically corresponds to the physical values of [[luminance]] or [[radiance]] that can be observed in the real world. This is different from traditional [[digital images]], which represent colors as they should appear on a monitor or a paper print. Therefore, HDR image formats are often called ''scene-referred'', in contrast to traditional digital images, which are ''device-referred'' or ''output-referred''. Furthermore, traditional images are usually encoded for the human [[visual system]] (maximizing the visual information stored in the fixed number of bits), which is usually called ''gamma encoding'' or ''[[gamma correction]]''. The values stored for HDR images are often [[gamma correction|gamma compressed]] ([[power law]]) or [[logarithm]]ically encoded, or [[floating point|floating-point]] linear values, since [[fixed-point arithmetic|fixed-point]] linear encodings are increasingly inefficient over higher dynamic ranges.<ref name=gregward/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/refer/Notes/picture_format.html |accessdate=2009-08-21 |title=The Radiance Picture File Format}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Fernando |first=Randima |title=GPU Gems |publisher=Addison-Wesley |location=Boston |year=2004 |chapter=26.5 Linear Pixel Values |url=http://http.developer.nvidia.com/GPUGems/gpugems_ch26.html |isbn=0-321-22832-4 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100412001848/http://http.developer.nvidia.com/GPUGems/gpugems_ch26.html |archivedate=2010-04-12 }}</ref>\n\nHDR images often don't use fixed ranges per color [[channel (digital image)|channel]]\u2014other than traditional images\u2014to represent many more colors over a much wider dynamic range. For that purpose, they do not use integer values to represent the single color channels (e.g., 0-255 in an 8 bit per pixel interval for red, green and blue) but instead use a floating point representation. Common are 16-bit (''[[half precision]]'') or 32-bit [[floating point]] numbers to represent HDR pixels. However, when the appropriate [[transfer function]] is used, HDR pixels for some applications can be represented with a [[color depth]] that has as few as 10\u201312&nbsp;bits for luminance and 8&nbsp;bits for [[chrominance]] without introducing any visible quantization artifacts.<ref name=gregward>{{cite web |url=http://www.anyhere.com/gward/hdrenc/hdr_encodings.html |title=High Dynamic Range Image Encodings |author1=Greg Ward |author2=Anyhere Software }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mpi-sb.mpg.de/resources/hdrvideo/ |title=Perception-motivated High Dynamic Range Video Encoding |author=[[Max Planck Institute for Computer Science]]}}</ref>\n\n== History of HDR photography ==\n\n=== Mid 19th century ===\n[[File:Gustave Le Gray - Brig upon the Water - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.2|An 1856 photo by [[Gustave Le Gray]]]]\nThe idea of using several exposures to adequately reproduce a too-extreme range of [[luminance]] was pioneered as early as the 1850s by [[Gustave Le Gray]] to render seascapes showing both the sky and the sea. Such rendering was impossible at the time using standard methods, as the luminosity range was too extreme. Le Gray used one negative for the sky, and another one with a longer exposure for the sea, and combined the two into one picture in positive.<ref name=GettyExh>[[J. Paul Getty Museum]].

This was effective because the dynamic range of the negative is significantly higher than would be available on the finished positive paper print when that is exposed via the negative in a uniform manner. An excellent example is the photograph ''Schweitzer at the Lamp'' by [[W. Eugene Smith]], from his 1954 [[photo essay]] ''A Man of Mercy'' on Dr. [[Albert Schweitzer]] and his humanitarian work in French Equatorial Africa. The image took 5 days to reproduce the tonal range of the scene, which ranges from a bright lamp (relative to the scene) to a dark shadow.<ref name=\"durand\"/>\n\n[[Ansel Adams]] elevated dodging and burning to an art form. Many of his famous prints were manipulated in the darkroom with these two methods. Adams wrote a comprehensive book on producing prints called ''The Print,'' which prominently features dodging and burning, in the context of his [[Zone System]].\n\nWith the advent of color photography, tone mapping in the darkroom was no longer possible due to the specific timing needed during the developing process of color film. Photographers looked to film manufacturers to design new film stocks with improved response, or continued to shoot in black and white to use tone mapping methods.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n\n[[File:Wyckoff HDR Curve.tif|thumb|left|upright=2.4|Exposure/Density Characteristics of Wyckoff's Extended Exposure Response Film]]\nColor film capable of directly recording high-dynamic-range images was developed by [[Charles Wyckoff]] and [[EG&G]] \"in the course of a contract with the Department of the Air Force\".<ref>{{cite patent | inventor-last = Wyckoff | inventor-first = Charles W.\n | inventorlink = Charles Wyckoff | inventor2-last = EG&G Inc., assignee | inventor2-first = | inventorlink2 = EG&G | publication-date = March 24, 1961 | issue-date = June 17, 1969 | title = Silver Halide Photographic Film having Increased Exposure-response Characteristics | country-code = US | description = | patent-number = 3450536 | url = http://www.google.com/patents?hl=en&lr=&vid=USPAT3450536&id=43RzAAAAEBAJ&oi=fnd&dq=%22Extended+exposure%22+Wyckoff&printsec=abstract#v=onepage&q=%22Extended%20exposure%22%20Wyckoff&f=false | accessdate = June 1, 2012}}</ref> This XR film had three [[Photographic emulsion|emulsion]] layers, an upper layer having an [[Film speed#ASA|ASA]] speed rating of 400, a middle layer with an intermediate rating, and a lower layer with an ASA rating of 0.004.
