He was a member of the [[United States House of Representatives]] from 1895 to 1897, and the [[List of Governors of New York|32nd Governor of New York]] from 1897 to 1898.\n\n==Early life==\nBlack was born near [[Limington, Maine|Limington, York County, Maine]] on March 8, 1853, one of eleven children born to farmer Jacob Black and Charlotte (Butters) Black.{{sfn|''American Biography''}} His father moved the family to [[Alfred, Maine]] after accepting an appointment as keeper of the [[York County, Maine|York County]] jail.{{sfn|''American Biography''}} Black graduated from [[Lebanon, Maine|Lebanon]] Academy in 1871, the taught school while attending [[Dartmouth College]].{{sfn|''American Biography''}} He graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in 1875, was an editor of all three of the school's student publications, and won prizes for oratory.{{sfn|''American Biography''}} While in college, Black joined the [[Delta Kappa Epsilon]] fraternity.\n\n==Start of career==\nAfter completing his education, Black moved [[Rome, New York]], where he sold [[Chromolithography|Chromolithographs]].{{sfn|''American Biography''}} He soon moved to [[Johnstown (city), New York|Johnstown, New York]] to become editor of the ''Johnstown Journal''.{{sfn|''American Biography''}} A member of the [[Half-Breeds (politics)|Half-Breed]] faction of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] and follower of [[James G. Blaine]], Black changed the political stance of the paper while its Democratic owner was out of town, for which he was promptly fired.{{sfn|''American Biography''}} He then moved to [[Troy, New York]], and worked for the ''Troy Whig'' and the ''Troy Times''.{{sfn|''American Biography''}} While working as a night reporter, he was a clerk in the Troy post office and [[reading law|studied law]] with the firm of Robertson & Foster.{{sfn|''American Biography''}} Black attained [[Admission to the bar in the United States|admission to the bar]] in 1879 and began to practice in Troy.{{sfn|''American Biography''}}\n\nIn 1888, Black campaigned for [[Benjamin Harrison]] for president.{{sfn|''American Biography''}} In 1892, he campaigned for Harrison's reelection, but Harrison was defeated by former President [[Grover Cleveland]].{{sfn|''American Biography''}} In March 1894, an election day dispute between Republicans and Democrats in Troy culminated with the [[murder of Robert Ross]], a Republican.{{sfn|''American Biography''}} Black assisted in the prosecution of the defendants, Democrats Bartholomew \"Bat\" Shea and John McGough, who were convicted. McGough was sentenced to 20 years in prison, and Shea was executed.\n\n==U.S. House==\nLargely as a result of the Ross murder case, in November 1894, Black was elected to the [[54th United States Congress]], representing [[New York's 19th congressional district]].{{sfn|''American Biography''}} He served from March 4, 1895 to January 7, 1897, when he resigned because he had been elected governor.{{sfn|''American Biography''}} During his House term, Black was a member of the Committee on Pacific Railroads and the Committee on Private Land Claims.{{sfn|''American Biography''}} He was a delegate to the [[1896 Republican National Convention]] and supported [[William McKinley]] for president.\n\n==Governor==\nBlack was elected governor [[New York state election, 1896|in 1896]] and served from January 1, 1897 to December 31, 1898.{{sfn|''American Biography''}} A highlight of his governorship was completion of construction on the [[New York State Capitol]], which had fallen far behind schedule and had been plagued with cost overruns.{{sfn|''American Biography''}}\n\nAs governor, Black advocated for conservation of the area now known as the [[Adirondack State Park]].{{sfn|''American Biography''}} As part of this effort, he oversaw the establishment of the [[History of the New York State College of Forestry]].{{sfn|''American Biography''}} During Black's governorship, the boroughs that now make up [[New York City]] were consolidated into one municipality.{{sfn|''American Biography''}}\n\nBlack also oversaw New York's participation in the [[Spanish-American War]].{{sfn|''American Biography''}} Under his leadership, 16,000 soldiers were raised, trained, and equipped for accession into the [[United States Army]] as it expanded for the war.{{sfn|''American Biography''}} In addition, he successfully advocated for election reforms, including allowing soldiers to vote while they out of state or outside the United States.{{sfn|''American Biography''}}\n\nIn 1896, Black had been nominated for governor by Republican political operative Louis F. Payn, who was widely regarded as a corrupt associate of [[Thomas C. Platt]], the boss of New York State's Republican Party. As governor, Black caused a controversy when appointed Payn as [[New York State Insurance Department|state insurance superintendent]]. Despite criticism from advocates of good government and civil service reform, Black continued to support Payn. Despite backing Payn, Black incurred Platt's displeasure when Black successfully opposed a bill Platt favored, which would have banned from newspapers editorial cartoons critical of state government officials.\n\nLate in Black's term, state officials were accused of squandering more than a million dollars on a project to expand the [[Erie Canal]], which had come to be regarded as a [[boondoggle]] because of delays and excessive costs. Black's chances for reelection were jeopardized, so Republicans replaced him as their 1898 gubernatorial nominee with [[Theodore Roosevelt]], who had recently attained hero status in Cuba during the [[Spanish-American War]]. Roosevelt won the November general election by narrowly defeating Democratic nominee [[Augustus Van Wyck]]. In 1899, an investigating commission appointed by Black, in conjunction with two special counsels appointed by Roosevelt, exonerated those involved of criminal wrongdoing.\n\n==Later life==\nAfterwards he resumed his law practice. Among the noteworthy cases in which he was involved, Black took part in the defense of Roland B. Molineaux in the famed ''[[People v. Molineux]]'' case. After Molineaux was convicted of murder, the conviction was overturned and he won an acquittal at retrial. The case was the source of the well-known \"Molineux rule\" which limits the ability of prosecutors to use prior crimes as proof that a defendant committed the crime with which he is charged. Black also took part in the defense of [[Caleb Powers]] for the assassination of Kentucky governor [[William Goebel]].\n\nBlack maintained his interest in politics even after leaving office. In 1904, he was a candidate for the Republican nomination for [[United States Senator]], but lost to incumbent [[Chauncey Depew]], who went on to win reelection. He was a delegate to the [[1904 Republican National Convention]], and nominated President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] for election to a full term. In 1908, Black supported William Howard Taft for president.\n\n==Death and burial==\nBlack died from heart disease at his home in Troy on March 22, 1913. He was cremated and his ashes were buried at his farm outside [[Freedom, New Hampshire]].\n\n==Family==\nIn 1879, Black married Lois B. Hamlin (1858-1931) of [[Provincetown, Massachusetts]], whom he had met while teaching school in Provincetown. They were the parents of a son, Arthur (1880-1953).\n\n==Honors==\nIn 1898, Black received the [[honorary degree]] of [[Legum Doctor|LL.D.]] from Dartmouth College.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n===Books===\n*{{cite book |editor-last=Cutter |editor-first=William Richard |date=1918 |title=American Biography: A New Cyclopedia |volume=II |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tmoKAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA347 |location=New York, NY |publisher=The American Historical Society |pages=347-348 |via=[[Google Books]] |ref={{sfnRef|''American Biography''}}}}\n\n==External links==\n{{CongBio|B000496}}\n*{{Findagrave|6848745}}\n*[https://www.nga.org/governor/frank-swett-black/ Biography, Frank Swett Black] at National Governors Association\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-par|us-hs}}\n{{US House succession box |\n  state=New York |\n  district=19 |\n  before=[[Charles Delemere Haines|Charles D.
