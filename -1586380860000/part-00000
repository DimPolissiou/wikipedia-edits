Downing''' (1860 \u2013 August 5, 1908) was a notorious outlaw during the [[Wild West]] era in [[Arizona]]. Downing had fled from the Texas Rangers posse that was after him when he came to Arizona. In Arizona, he was involved in the killing of William S. \u201cSlim\u201d Traynor     and in various train robberies including the robbery of the Train Depot in the town of [[Cochise, Arizona|Cochise]].<ref name=\"BSG\">{{cite web|url=https://www.legendsofamerica.com/alvord-stiles-gang/|title=Alvord-Stiles Gang of Outlaws|website=Legends of America|accessdate=September 18, 2019}}</ref> Downing was so unpopular that even members of his gang couldn't stand him.<ref name=\"AA\">{{cite web|url=http://arizonaoddities.com/2011/05/death-of-old-arizona-gunslinger-inspires-well-known-western-axiom/|title=Death of Old Arizona Gunslinger Inspires Well-Known Western Axiom|website=Arizona Oddities|accessdate=September 18, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Early years==\nDowning was born in [[Texas]]. He was in trouble with the law when he came to [[Arizona Territory]]. All the while a [[Texas Ranger Division|Texas Rangers]] posse was in pursuit of Downing. Allegedly his real name was Frank Jackson, a teenager who was a member of the [[Sam Bass (outlaw)|Sam Bass]] gang. Jackson had been involved in a shoot-out at [[Round Rock, Texas]] between the Bass gang and the [[Texas Ranger Division|Texas Rangers]] in July, 1878. Jackson was shot in one leg, but survived. The posse killed Bass, however Jackson escaped and rode through [[New Mexico]] until he reached Arizona where he assumed the name William F.

Downing worked as a cowhand at the nearby ranches. He was hired to work in the Esperanza Ranch, a ranch which was known for hiring rustlers, outlaws and renegade Apaches. Though Downing became known for his quarrelsome nature, he was also known to be less quarrelsome when he was drinking whiskey.<ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\n==The killing of  William S. \u201cSlim\u201d Traynor==\n[[File:Pearce-Ranch House-1896.jpg|200px|thumb|Ranch house in Pearce]][[File:Burt Alvord Arizona.jpg|200px|thumb|Constable Burt Alvord]]\nDowning and his wife moved to the town of [[Willcox, Arizona|Willcox]]. Downing spent most of his time hanging around saloons and associating with the members of a gang run by Albert R. \u201cBurt\u201d Alvord, who was the town constable when he wasn't working as a ranch-hand. However, there was a particular person whom Downing did not like and that was William S. \u201cSlim\u201d Traynor.<ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\nTraynor, who also went by the name of \"Bill Traynor\", was a native of [[Tennessee]] who at onetime had been an outlaw, mine guard and was a veteran [[Rough Rider]] campaigning in [[Cuba]] with [[Theodore Roosevelt]]. He was hired by cattle inspector Edwin Russell Hooker to look after his father, Henry Hooker, Sierra Bonita range interests. Traynor was engaged to be married to Mila Allaire, a young lady from a Willcox ranching family. He suspected Downing of stealing cattle and re-branding them. As such he made it known publicly that Downing was a rustler and that he was looking for him.<ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\nOn the evening of May 19, 1899, Traynor and his friend Henry C. Taylor, an off-duty bartender, walked into Tom Fulghum's \"Elite Saloon\" on the corner of Maley and Haskell Streets. Some witnesses say that Downing came in after Traynor, while others claim that Downing was already in the saloon.<ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\nWitnesses to the events that followed stated that when Downing walked in, Traynor dropped his right hand as if going for his gun. Four shots rang out from Bill Downing's pistol and Bill Traynor lay dead on the barroom floor; shot through the head and chest. Downing was arrested and during his trial he claimed the following: \"I accepted Taylor's invitation to take a cigar and as I answered, (Traynor) whirled around as though he went after his gun. As I stepped up to the bar, I was watching him on account of the threats he had made, and I looked outside. I thought it was a life-and-death matter and drew my gun and jerked Thomas Burts back so as not to shoot him and commenced shooting. I am not certain as to how many shots I fired.\u201d<ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\nConstable Alvord testified that he took the pistol and belt off the person of the deceased. He continued to state that he found the pistol loaded with five cartridges and one empty chamber. The pistol was in the scabbard when he took it off the deceased. No one took and checked Downing's gun. According to Constable Alvord, Traynor's body bore wounds from three bullets. One had torn through his breast and exited his shoulder; the other two had penetrated his skull. The coroner's jury found that Downing was acting in self-defense and was justified.<ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\n==The Southern-Pacific Cochise Depot robbery==\n[[File:Willcox-Building-John H. Norton and Company Store -1880.jpg|200px|thumb|The Soto Brothers Mercantile store which originally was the John H. Norton and Company Store]][[File:Cochise-Cochise Southern Pacific Railroad Train Depot-1903.jpg|200px|thumb|The Cochise Southern Pacific Railroad Train Depot in 2019]]\nConstable [[Burt Alvord]] was hired by the town of Willcox to police the boisterous cowboys in the area because of his reputation of being a bad man in [[Tombstone, Arizona|Tombstone]]. Alvord hired Bill Downing and [[Billy Stiles]] as deputies. Together with their new found legality they would be able to pursue their criminal careers without arousing the suspicion of the town folks. Among the members of the newly founded Alvord-Stiles Gang were local cowboys, such as Matt Burts, the Owen brothers and Jack Dunlap.<ref name=\"BSG\"/><ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\nThey conspired to hold up the Southern Pacific's westbound No. 10 train that stopped at Cochise Station at [[Cochise, Arizona|Cochise Junction]]. In order to carry out their mission Downing burglarized the Soto Brothers Mercantile store in Willcox where they pilfered dynamite. Then, Downing and the gang burglarized a mining camp in Dos Cabezas, where they stole additional dynamite, plus explosive caps and fuse.<ref name=\"BSG\"/><ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\nThe date set for the robbery was September 9, 1899. It was Downing's responsibility to tend to the horses. Stiles and Burts were to stop the train at Cochise Station and proceed with the robbery. They  held at gun point the engineer, the fireman, the mail clerk and a Wells Fargo man. The safe inside the express car was blown up. Their first heist was successful and they seized between $2,000 and $3,000 in cash and jewelry.<ref name=\"BSG\"/><ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\nConstable Alvord organized a posse when news of the robbery reached Willcox. He sent the posses in all directions except the right one. Downing, Burts and Stiles stashed everything in Burt Alvord's chicken house in Willcox and then they \"joined the posse.\" As expected the posse did not find anything. The stolen goods were removed from the chicken house and stashed in Bill Downing's ranch near Pearce. The only member of the gang that took his share was Matt Burts who headed to the state of [[Oregon]].<ref name=\"BSG\"/><ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\n==The failed Fairbank train robbery==\n[[File:Jeff_Milton_Arizona_Lawman.jpg|thumb|150px|Jeff Milton]][[File:Fairbank Railroad Depot Arizona Circa 1900.jpg|thumb|200px|The railroad depot in Fairbank, c. 1900.]][[File:T-Courthouse.jpg|thumb|200px|The Tombstone Courthouse]]\nOn February 15, 1900, the Alvord-Stiles Gang attempted a second major robbery, this time in [[Fairbank, Arizona]]. The members of the gang who participated in the holdup of the New Mexico & Arizona's northbound No. 1 on the Nogales-to-Benson line, were [[Jack Dunlop|Jesse \u201cThree-Fingered Jack\u201d Dunlap]], Tom \u201cBravo Juan\u201d Yoas, Robert Brown, and George and Lewis Owings. However, they were unaware that [[Jeff Milton]] a [[Wells Fargo|Wells Fargo Express]] messenger was aboard the train that day. Milton, an ex-Texas Ranger, had a long career in law enforcement.<ref name=\"BSG\"/><ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\nThe gang's attempt to rob the train failed because of Milton's intervention. He fired his gun and shot Jack Dunlap despite the fact that he himself was wounded with a bullet on his left arm between the shoulder and elbow which shattered the bone and left his arm useless. The gang fled the scene and left Dunlap behind. When a posse from Tombstone arrived and found Dunlap, he decided to cooperate and told them the names of those involved in the attempted but failed robbery. Dunlap died shortly after the encounter, but not before implicating Burt Alvord, Billy Stiles and Bill Downing as the planners of the robbery.<ref name=\"BSG\"/><ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\nBill Downing and some members of the gang were arrested and sent to the jail in Tombstone, since he had been implicated in the earlier Southern-Pacific Cochise Depot holdup. At the time, train robbery was a capital offense in the Arizona Territory. Downing's trial was set for December 10, 1900, in the Tombstone Courthouse in what is officially known as \"Territory of Arizona vs. W.F. Downing, case No. 745A\". On April 7, 1900, Stiles went to Tombstone and went to the the jailhouse. He shot [[United States Marshals Service|Deputy Marshal]] George Bravin in the foot, and freed the gang members who were in the jail, with the exception of Downing. During the trail some of the members of the Alvord gang turned against Downing and testified against him. Stiles and Matt Burts were among those who testified for the prosecution. However, the majority of the jurors believed that capital punishment is not justified in cases where no lives were lost. Jury foreman L.A. Smith announced before Judge [[George Russell Davis]] that even though the jurors believed that Downing was guilty of train robbery, they refused to return a guilty verdict.<ref name=\"BSG\"/><ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/><ref name=\"legendsofamerica.com1\">{{Cite web | title=Burton Alvord - Lawmen Turned Outlaw| work=| url=http://www.legendsofamerica.com/we-burtonalvord.html| access date=June 30, 2012}}</ref>\n\nEven though Downing was acquitted in the robbery case, he was found guilty of interfering with the United States mail, a federal charge and was sentenced to 10 years of prison-time to be served in the Yuma Territorial Prison.<ref name=\"BSG\"/><ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\n==Yuma Territorial Prison==\n[[File:Yuma-Yuma Territorial Prison-1875-8-2.jpg|200px|thumb|Yuma Territorial Prison cell with steel bunkers]]\nThe [[Yuma Territorial Prison]] was a prison built by prisoners in 1875. The prison opened while Arizona was still a U.S. territory. Conditions in the prison were harsh. Some prisoners had to sleep in steel bunkbeds. Downing was assigned a number, inmate number 1733, just like any other prisoner. On April 11, 1901, he entered the Yuma prison through the [[sally port]] which is a secure, controlled entryway to the prison.<ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\nDowning's leg became infected and swollen while he was in prison. This was a result of the gunshot injuries he received during a gun battle while riding with the Sam Bass gang back in Texas. The penitentiary physician, Dr. James A. Ketcherside treated the old wound. The doctor suggested that the leg be amputated, but Downings refused to accept the request.<ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\nDowning served a total of seven years in prison and was finally released for good behavior. According to Thomas H. Rynning, the Yuma prison warden, Downing had been a model prisoner.<ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\nMrs. Downing was an attractive lady who was in poor health. While her husband was incarcerated, she sold their property in Willcox and used the money to try to gain her husband's freedom from the prison in Yuma. Mrs Downing eventually found herself alone and in need of money. She was hired to work in the home of A.F. Franklin in [[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]]. On April 17, 1902, she was hired as a domestic servant by Tucson civic leader and entrepreneur John Ivancovich. A day later, shortly before her husband's release from prison, she was found dead in the servant's quarters. A coroner's jury determined that she had died of heart failure and attributed it to worry and nervousness brought on by the conviction and sentence of her husband. Mrs. Downing was buried in the Old City Cemetery in Willcox a.k.a. Willcox Pioneer Cemetery.<ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/><ref name=\"OCC\">{{cite web|url=http://files.usgwarchives.net/az/cochise/cemeteries/wilcoxhiscem.txt|website=files.usgwarchives.net|title=Old City Cemetery|accessdate=September 18, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Downing's last stand==\n[[File:Willcox-Alley in Marley St.jpg|200px|thumb|An alley in Willcox]][[File:Willcox-Cemetery-Willcox Pioneer Cemetery-1880.jpg|200px|thumb|The Old City Cemetery where Bill Downing and his wife are buried]]\nDowning returned to Willcox upon his release from prison and opened a saloon which he named the Free and Easy Saloon on the corner of Maley Street. Willcox at the time had an ordinance which forbid gambling, prostitution and the serving of alcohol to women. Downing was known as a one to defy the law and he hired prostitutes who were highly skilled pickpockets.<ref name=\"AA\"/> Constable Bud Snow and Ranger Speed arrested Downing for serving women at the Free and Easy. Downing had encountered Arizona Ranger William Slaughter \u201cBilly\u201d Speed before. Speed was among the jurors who acquitted Downing in the 1899, killing of William S. \u201cSlim\u201d Traynor. Despite that they became bitter enemies. Downing pleaded guilty and paid a fifty dollar fine. The very next day he was arrested again, this time he was charged with assaulting a barber. Again he pleaded guilty and paid a fine of ten dollars.<ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\nThe citizen's of Willcox became tired of Downing's defiance of the law and sent a citizens petition to Harry C. Wheeler, the Captain of the Arizona Rangers, requesting protection from the  \u201cdrunk and unruly\u201d saloon-keeper. Wheeler received word that Downing had threaten to kill any officer who interfered with him. Thus, Wheeler ordered his men to kill Downing without any hesitation.<ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\nDowning had some problems with Cuco Leal, a prostitute who lived in his saloon. He went to the office of Constable Snow to complain and to ask the she be removed from his saloon. At the same time he also warned that if Ranger Speed ever stuck his head inside of the door of his saloon, he would shoot it off. He also stated that he will kill Speed when the time is right.<ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\nThe following day a saloon customer complained that someone had stolen some his money. Downing jumped to the conclusion that it was Cuco Leal. He confronted and beat her. She then ran into the Ranchman's Corral Saloon, whose owner was George McKittrick, a rival of Downing. McKittrick told Leal to stay in his saloon and to stay clear of the \"Free and Easy\" saloon. McKittrick then went to town Justice Page and told him about the Downing-Leal situation. Page issued a warrant for Downing's arrest and handed the warrant to Constable Bud Snow. The constable went to Ranger Speed's house and asked him to join him in presenting the warrant. Speed agreed and recommended that they act in the following morning.<ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\nThe following morning Downing was in his saloon drinking whiskey. He decided that he would show up in Judge Page's office to discuss the Leal situation. He got up to go and at the same time left his gun behind. When he stepped out the door he noticed that Constable Snow was heading towards the saloon and he ran back inside. He did not notice that Ranger Speed was accompanying the constable. Once they reached the saloon, Constable Snow told Speed to guard the back door of the saloon which was located by an alley. Ranger Speed loaded his .30-40 Winchester and headed towards the alley door.<ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\nDowning thought that the constable would come in through the front door and decided to leave the saloon through the back exit. When he went out to the alley he came face-to-face with Ranger Speed.

Downing''' (1860 \u2013 August 5, 1908) was a notorious outlaw during the [[Wild West]] era in [[Arizona]]. Downing had fled from the Texas Rangers posse that was after him when he came to Arizona. In Arizona, he was involved in the killing of William S. \u201cSlim\u201d Traynor     and in various train robberies including the robbery of the Train Depot in the town of [[Cochise, Arizona|Cochise]].<ref name=\"BSG\">{{cite web|url=https://www.legendsofamerica.com/alvord-stiles-gang/|title=Alvord-Stiles Gang of Outlaws|website=Legends of America|accessdate=September 18, 2019}}</ref> Downing was so unpopular that even members of his gang couldn't stand him.<ref name=\"AA\">{{cite web|url=http://arizonaoddities.com/2011/05/death-of-old-arizona-gunslinger-inspires-well-known-western-axiom/|title=Death of Old Arizona Gunslinger Inspires Well-Known Western Axiom|website=Arizona Oddities|accessdate=September 18, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Early years==\nDowning was born in [[Texas]]. He was in trouble with the law when he came to [[Arizona Territory]]. All the while a [[Texas Ranger Division|Texas Rangers]] posse was in pursuit of Downing. Allegedly his real name was Frank Jackson, a teenager who was a member of the [[Sam Bass (outlaw)|Sam Bass]] gang. Jackson had been involved in a shoot-out at [[Round Rock, Texas]] between the Bass gang and the [[Texas Ranger Division|Texas Rangers]] in July, 1878. Jackson was shot in one leg, but survived. The posse killed Bass, however Jackson escaped and rode through [[New Mexico]] until he reached Arizona where he assumed the name William F.

Downing worked as a cowhand at the nearby ranches. He was hired to work in the Esperanza Ranch, a ranch which was known for hiring rustlers, outlaws and renegade Apaches. Though Downing became known for his quarrelsome nature, he was also known to be less quarrelsome when he was drinking whiskey.<ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\n==The killing of  William S. \u201cSlim\u201d Traynor==\n[[File:Pearce-Ranch House-1896.jpg|200px|thumb|Ranch house in Pearce]][[File:Burt Alvord Arizona.jpg|200px|thumb|Constable Burt Alvord]]\nDowning and his wife moved to the town of [[Willcox, Arizona|Willcox]]. Downing spent most of his time hanging around saloons and associating with the members of a gang run by Albert R. \u201cBurt\u201d Alvord, who was the town constable when he wasn't working as a ranch-hand. However, there was a particular person whom Downing did not like and that was William S. \u201cSlim\u201d Traynor.<ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\nTraynor, who also went by the name of \"Bill Traynor\", was a native of [[Tennessee]] who at onetime had been an outlaw, mine guard and was a veteran [[Rough Rider]] campaigning in [[Cuba]] with [[Theodore Roosevelt]]. He was hired by cattle inspector Edwin Russell Hooker to look after his father, Henry Hooker, Sierra Bonita range interests. Traynor was engaged to be married to Mila Allaire, a young lady from a Willcox ranching family. He suspected Downing of stealing cattle and re-branding them. As such he made it known publicly that Downing was a rustler and that he was looking for him.<ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\nOn the evening of May 19, 1899, Traynor and his friend Henry C. Taylor, an off-duty bartender, walked into Tom Fulghum's \"Elite Saloon\" on the corner of Maley and Haskell Streets. Some witnesses say that Downing came in after Traynor, while others claim that Downing was already in the saloon.<ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\nWitnesses to the events that followed stated that when Downing walked in, Traynor dropped his right hand as if going for his gun. Four shots rang out from Bill Downing's pistol and Bill Traynor lay dead on the barroom floor; shot through the head and chest. Downing was arrested and during his trial he claimed the following: \"I accepted Taylor's invitation to take a cigar and as I answered, (Traynor) whirled around as though he went after his gun. As I stepped up to the bar, I was watching him on account of the threats he had made, and I looked outside. I thought it was a life-and-death matter and drew my gun and jerked Thomas Burts back so as not to shoot him and commenced shooting. I am not certain as to how many shots I fired.\u201d<ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\nConstable Alvord testified that he took the pistol and belt off the person of the deceased. He continued to state that he found the pistol loaded with five cartridges and one empty chamber. The pistol was in the scabbard when he took it off the deceased. No one took and checked Downing's gun. According to Constable Alvord, Traynor's body bore wounds from three bullets. One had torn through his breast and exited his shoulder; the other two had penetrated his skull. The coroner's jury found that Downing was acting in self-defense and was justified.<ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\n==The Southern-Pacific Cochise Depot robbery==\n[[File:Willcox-Building-John H. Norton and Company Store -1880.jpg|200px|thumb|The Soto Brothers Mercantile store which originally was the John H. Norton and Company Store]][[File:Cochise-Cochise Southern Pacific Railroad Train Depot-1903.jpg|200px|thumb|The Cochise Southern Pacific Railroad Train Depot in 2019]]\nConstable [[Burt Alvord]] was hired by the town of Willcox to police the boisterous cowboys in the area because of his reputation of being a bad man in [[Tombstone, Arizona|Tombstone]]. Alvord hired Bill Downing and [[Billy Stiles]] as deputies. Together with their new found legality they would be able to pursue their criminal careers without arousing the suspicion of the town folks. Among the members of the newly founded Alvord-Stiles Gang were local cowboys, such as Matt Burts, the Owen brothers and Jack Dunlap.<ref name=\"BSG\"/><ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\nThey conspired to hold up the Southern Pacific's westbound No. 10 train that stopped at Cochise Station at [[Cochise, Arizona|Cochise Junction]]. In order to carry out their mission Downing burglarized the Soto Brothers Mercantile store in Willcox where they pilfered dynamite. Then, Downing and the gang burglarized a mining camp in Dos Cabezas, where they stole additional dynamite, plus explosive caps and fuse.<ref name=\"BSG\"/><ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\nThe date set for the robbery was September 9, 1899. It was Downing's responsibility to tend to the horses. Stiles and Burts were to stop the train at Cochise Station and proceed with the robbery. They  held at gun point the engineer, the fireman, the mail clerk and a Wells Fargo man. The safe inside the express car was blown up. Their first heist was successful and they seized between $2,000 and $3,000 in cash and jewelry.<ref name=\"BSG\"/><ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\nConstable Alvord organized a posse when news of the robbery reached Willcox. He sent the posses in all directions except the right one. Downing, Burts and Stiles stashed everything in Burt Alvord's chicken house in Willcox and then they \"joined the posse.\" As expected the posse did not find anything. The stolen goods were removed from the chicken house and stashed in Bill Downing's ranch near Pearce. The only member of the gang that took his share was Matt Burts who headed to the state of [[Oregon]].<ref name=\"BSG\"/><ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\n==The failed Fairbank train robbery==\n[[File:Jeff_Milton_Arizona_Lawman.jpg|thumb|150px|Jeff Milton]][[File:Fairbank Railroad Depot Arizona Circa 1900.jpg|thumb|200px|The railroad depot in Fairbank, c. 1900.]][[File:T-Courthouse.jpg|thumb|200px|The Tombstone Courthouse]]\nOn February 15, 1900, the Alvord-Stiles Gang attempted a second major robbery, this time in [[Fairbank, Arizona]]. The members of the gang who participated in the holdup of the New Mexico & Arizona's northbound No. 1 on the Nogales-to-Benson line, were [[Jack Dunlop|Jesse \u201cThree-Fingered Jack\u201d Dunlap]], Tom \u201cBravo Juan\u201d Yoas, Robert Brown, and George and Lewis Owings. However, they were unaware that [[Jeff Milton]] a [[Wells Fargo|Wells Fargo Express]] messenger was aboard the train that day. Milton, an ex-Texas Ranger, had a long career in law enforcement.<ref name=\"BSG\"/><ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\nThe gang's attempt to rob the train failed because of Milton's intervention. He fired his gun and shot Jack Dunlap despite the fact that he himself was wounded with a bullet on his left arm between the shoulder and elbow which shattered the bone and left his arm useless. The gang fled the scene and left Dunlap behind. When a posse from Tombstone arrived and found Dunlap, he decided to cooperate and told them the names of those involved in the attempted but failed robbery. Dunlap died shortly after the encounter, but not before implicating Burt Alvord, Billy Stiles and Bill Downing as the planners of the robbery.<ref name=\"BSG\"/><ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\nBill Downing and some members of the gang were arrested and sent to the jail in Tombstone, since he had been implicated in the earlier Southern-Pacific Cochise Depot holdup. At the time, train robbery was a capital offense in the Arizona Territory. Downing's trial was set for December 10, 1900, in the Tombstone Courthouse in what is officially known as \"Territory of Arizona vs. W.F. Downing, case No. 745A\". On April 7, 1900, Stiles went to Tombstone and broke in the jail, shot [[United States Marshals Service|Deputy Marshal]] George Bravin in the foot, and freed the gang members who were in the jail, with the exception of Downing. During the trail some of the members of the Alvord gang turned against Downing and testified against him. Stiles and Matt Burts were among those who testified for the prosecution. However, the majority of the jurors believed that capital punishment is not justified in cases where no lives were lost. Jury foreman L.A. Smith announced before Judge [[George Russell Davis]] that even though the jurors believed that Downing was guilty of train robbery, they refused to return a guilty verdict.<ref name=\"BSG\"/><ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/><ref name=\"legendsofamerica.com1\">{{Cite web | title=Burton Alvord - Lawmen Turned Outlaw| work=| url=http://www.legendsofamerica.com/we-burtonalvord.html| accessdate=June 30, 2012}}</ref>\n\nEven though Downing was acquitted in the robbery case, he was found guilty of interfering with the United States mail, a federal charge and was sentenced to 10 years to be served in the Yuma Territorial Prison.<ref name=\"BSG\"/><ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\n==Yuma Territorial Prison==\n[[File:Yuma-Yuma Territorial Prison-1875-8-2.jpg|200px|thumb|Yuma Territorial Prison cell with steel bunkers]]\nThe [[Yuma Territorial Prison]] was a prison built by prisoners in 1875. The prison opened while Arizona was still a U.S. territory. Conditions in the prison were harsh. Some prisoners had to sleep in steel bunkbeds. Downing was assigned a number, inmate number 1733, just like any other prisoner. On April 11, 1901, he entered the Yuma prison through the [[sally port]] which is a secure, controlled entryway to the prison.<ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\nDowning's leg became infected and swollen while he was in prison. This was a result of the gunshot injuries he received during a gun battle while riding with the Sam Bass gang back in Texas. The penitentiary physician, Dr. James A. Ketcherside treated the old wound. The doctor suggested that the leg be amputated, but Downings refused to accept the request.<ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\nDowning served a total of seven years in prison and was finally released for good behavior. According to Thomas H. Rynning, the Yuma prison warden, Downing had been a model prisoner.<ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\nMrs. Downing was an attractive lady who was in poor health. While her husband was incarcerated, she sold their property in Willcox and used the money to try to gain her husband's freedom from the prison in Yuma. Mrs Downing eventually found herself alone and in need of money. She was hired to work in the home of A.F. Franklin in [[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]]. On April 17, 1902, she was hired as a domestic servant by Tucson civic leader and entrepreneur John Ivancovich. A day later, shortly before her husband's release from prison, she was found dead in the servant's quarters. A coroner's jury determined that she had died of heart failure and attributed it to worry and nervousness brought on by the conviction and sentence of her husband. Mrs. Downing was buried in the Old City Cemetery in Willcox a.k.a. Willcox Pioneer Cemetery.<ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/><ref name=\"OCC\">{{cite web|url=http://files.usgwarchives.net/az/cochise/cemeteries/wilcoxhiscem.txt|website=files.usgwarchives.net|title=Old City Cemetery|accessdate=September 18, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Downing's last stand==\n[[File:Willcox-Alley in Marley St.jpg|200px|thumb|An alley in Willcox]][[File:Willcox-Cemetery-Willcox Pioneer Cemetery-1880.jpg|200px|thumb|The Old City Cemetery where Bill Downing and his wife are buried]]\nDowning returned to Willcox upon his release from prison and opened a saloon which he named the Free and Easy Saloon on the corner of Maley Street. Willcox at the time had an ordinance which forbid gambling, prostitution and the serving of alcohol to women. Downing was known as a one to defy the law and he hired prostitutes who were highly skilled pickpockets.<ref name=\"AA\"/> Constable Bud Snow and Ranger Speed arrested Downing for serving women at the Free and Easy. Downing had encountered Arizona Ranger William Slaughter \u201cBilly\u201d Speed before. Speed was among the jurors who acquitted Downing in the 1899, killing of William S. \u201cSlim\u201d Traynor. Despite that they became bitter enemies. Downing pleaded guilty and paid a fifty dollar fine. The very next day he was arrested again, this time he was charged with assaulting a barber. Again he pleaded guilty and paid a fine of ten dollars.<ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\nThe citizen's of Willcox became tired of Downing's defiance of the law and sent a citizens petition to Harry C. Wheeler, the Captain of the Arizona Rangers, requesting protection from the  \u201cdrunk and unruly\u201d saloon-keeper. Wheeler received word that Downing had threaten to kill any officer who interfered with him. Thus, Wheeler ordered his men to kill Downing without any hesitation.<ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\nDowning had some problems with Cuco Leal, a prostitute who lived in his saloon. He went to the office of Constable Snow to complain and to ask the she be removed from his saloon. At the same time he also warned that if Ranger Speed ever stuck his head inside of the door of his saloon, he would shoot it off. He also stated that he will kill Speed when the time is right.<ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\nThe following day a saloon customer complained that someone had stolen some his money. Downing jumped to the conclusion that it was Cuco Leal. He confronted and beat her. She then ran into the Ranchman's Corral Saloon, whose owner was George McKittrick, a rival of Downing. McKittrick told Leal to stay in his saloon and to stay clear of the \"Free and Easy\" saloon. McKittrick then went to town Justice Page and told him about the Downing-Leal situation. Page issued a warrant for Downing's arrest and handed the warrant to Constable Bud Snow. The constable went to Ranger Speed's house and asked him to join him in presenting the warrant. Speed agreed and recommended that they act in the following morning.<ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\nThe following morning Downing was in his saloon drinking whiskey. He decided that he would show up in Judge Page's office to discuss the Leal situation. He got up to go and at the same time left his gun behind. When he stepped out the door he noticed that Constable Snow was heading towards the saloon and he ran back inside. He did not notice that Ranger Speed was accompanying the constable. Once they reached the saloon, Constable Snow told Speed to guard the back door of the saloon which was located by an alley. Ranger Speed loaded his .30-40 Winchester and headed towards the alley door.<ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\nDowning thought that the constable would come in through the front door and decided to leave the saloon through the back exit. When he went out to the alley he came face-to-face with Ranger Speed. The Ranger ordered him to surrender but, Downing made a gesture as to reach for gun, forgetting that he had left his weapon in the saloon. The Ranger then raised his Winchester and fired. The bullet from Speed's rifle entered through his right breast, punctured his right lung and exited beneath his right shoulder blade. Downing died immediately.<ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\nArizona Ranger Captain Wheeler made the following remark to the community's reaction to Downing's demise: \u201cThis is the first time I have known a dead man to be without a single friend and the first time that I have known a killing to meet absolute general rejoicing in all this town and precinct.\u201d Downing was buried in an unmarked grave in the Old City Cemetery of Willcox a.k.a. Willcox Pioneer Cemetery.<ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/><ref name=\"OCC\"/>\n\nThe coroner's jury found that the shot was fired by Speed was in the performance of his duty as an officer and that he was perfectly justified in the act, and, therefore, he was exonerated from all blame in the matter.<ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\n==Further reading==\n*\"Arizoniana: Stories from Old Arizona\"; by: Marshall Trimble; Publisher: Primer Pub; {{ISBN|188559089X}}; {{ISBN|978-1885590893}}\n*\"Arizona Outlaws and Lawmen: Gunslingers, Bandits, Heroes and Peacekeepers\"; by: Marshall Trimble; Publisher: The History Press; ASIN: B00XZPQM2W\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Arizona|Biography}}\n*[[List of historic properties in Willcox, Arizona]]\n===Arizona pioneers===\n*[[Henry Garfias]]\n*[[Joe Mayer]]\n*[[William John Murphy]]\n*[[Levi Ruggles]]\n*[[Trinidad Swilling]]\n*[[Ora Rush Weed]]\n*[[Henry Wickenburg]]\n*[[Sedona Schnebly]]\n\n{{Clear}}\n{{Wild West}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Downing, Bill}}\n[[Category:1860 births]]\n[[Category:1908 deaths]]\n[[Category:Lawmen of the American Old West]]\n[[Category:Arizona folklore]]\n[[Category:Gunslingers of the American Old West]]\n[[Category:Arizona pioneers]]\n[[Category:Outlaws of the American Old West]]\n[[Category:Cowboys]]\n[[Category:American outlaws]]\n[[Category:People of the American Old West]]\n", "name_user": "Marine 69-71", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eThe failed Fairbank train robbery", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Downing"}

Hall had planned for years to victimize his former classmate's wealthy family.\n\nHeady went to Bobby's school, persuading a [[nun]] that she was his aunt, and told her that his mother had suffered a heart attack. She then took Bobby away and was gone by the time the Greenleases discovered the ruse. The couple then took Bobby across the state line to [[Johnson County, Kansas|Johnson County]], [[Kansas]], where Hall shot him dead with a [[revolver]]. They then took the child's body to St. Joseph and buried him in the backyard of Heady's house at 1201 South 38th Street.\n\nAfter the murder, Hall and Heady sent Bobby's father a message demanding a [[ransom]] of $600,000 (${{Inflation|US|0.6|1953|r=1|fmt=c}} million today). Greenlease, desperately trying to save his son, held off the police and the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]], paying the money. At that time it was the largest ransom ever paid in American history, and remained so until the 1972 kidnapping of [[Virginia Piper kidnapping|Virginia Piper]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/the-biggest-ransoms-ever-2012-9#|title=The 18 Largest Ransoms Ever Paid|work=Business Insider|access-date=2017-09-21|language=en}}</ref> Hall became convinced that police would trace them to St. Joseph, so he randomly decided to drive to [[St. Louis]]. The couple collected the ransom and fled.\n\n==Arrest==\nOnce in St. Louis, Hall left Heady in the middle of the night in a rented room. He contacted criminal associates to enlist their help in diverting police attention. One of the associates, a former [[prostitute]] named Sandra O'Day, was supposed to fly to [[Los Angeles]] and mail a letter Hall had written. It was thought that this would divert police attention from St. Louis. However, O'Day caught a glimpse of the ransom money.<ref name=\"NYTimes\">{{cite book |author=Heidenry, John |title=Zero at the Bone: The Playboy, the Prostitute, and the Murder of Bobby Greenlease |publisher=St. Martin's Press |location=New York |year=2009 |isbn=0-312-37679-0 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/zeroatboneplaybo00heid }}</ref> St. Louis police soon learned that Hall was flaunting a large sum of money, and they brought him in for questioning.\n\nHall eventually implicated Heady. The police found her at an apartment at 4504 Arsenal Street and discovered Bobby's body in a shallow grave in her backyard.<ref name=\"DeadlyWomen\"/> Bobby was later interred in a [[mausoleum]] at Forest Hill Cemetery in Kansas City.\n\n==Execution==\nBobby's kidnapping and murder scandalized the nation and soon led to federal [[indictment]]s for Hall and Heady. Both pleaded guilty to kidnapping and murder, and were [[execution|executed]] together in the Missouri [[gas chamber]] on December 18, 1953.\n\nHeady was one of only two women since 1865 to be executed by federal authorities. The other one was [[Ethel Greenglass Rosenberg]]. Since the federal government did not have any execution facilities, Missouri's state facilities were to carry out the executions.\n\nOnly $288,000 of the ransom money was recovered. The missing $312,000 remained a subject of wide speculation. Some of the theories accounting for this were:\n\n*A cab driver who took Hall to the [[Coral Court Motel]] had tipped off mob boss [[Frank Costello]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Zero at the Bone: The Playboy, the Prostitute, and the Murder of Bobby Greenlease|author=John Heidenry|publisher=St. Martin's Press|year=2009|isbn=9780312376796|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/zeroatboneplaybo00heid}}</ref>\n*Hall tried unsuccessfully to bury the cash near the [[Meramec River]], though the FBI would later search that area in vain.\n*Suitcases in Hall's possession upon his arrest were not brought to the 11th District Precinct Station (the arresting officers, Lieutenant Louis Ira Shoulders and Patrolman Elmer Dolan, were subsequently federally indicted for perjury).<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|title=The Greenlease Kidnapping|url=https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/history/famous-cases/greenlease-kidnapping/|website=Federal Bureau of Investigation|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160122065901/https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/history/famous-cases/greenlease-kidnapping/|archivedate=January 22, 2016}}</ref>\n*The cash fell into the hands of mobsters or was hidden in the walls of the motel, though the 1995 demolition of the Coral Court Motel turned up nothing.<ref>{{cite news|title=St. Louis' Little Sin|author=James Hirsch|date=July 23, 1988|publisher=NY Times News Service|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1298&dat=19880723&id=s_9NAAAAIBAJ&sjid=1osDAAAAIBAJ&pg=5436,4699825<!--|url2=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2199&dat=19880724&id=TIoyAAAAIBAJ&sjid=uOYFAAAAIBAJ&pg=6415,4889495--> }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of kidnappings]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://vault.fbi.gov/Greenlease%20Kidnapping Federal Bureau of Investigation's case on Greenlease kidnapping]\n*[https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/mike_donnelly_umkc/042801greenlease.html&date=2009-10-26+02:38:07 Blood Money and the Death of a Child \u2014 The United States v.

[[Marta Miraz\u00f3n Lahr]] conducted research on skeletons from [[Fezzan]] dating to the Roman era and found that the skeletons most closely matched  \nNeolithic [[Sub-Saharan Africa|sub-saharan African]] samples, from [[Chad]], [[Mali]], and [[Niger]].
