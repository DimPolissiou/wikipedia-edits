He was in love with his cousin Solaiyamma ([[Meena (actress)|Meena]]) and wanted to marry her, but they had nothing in common. The soft-spoken Solaiyamma was afraid of him. In the meantime, Murugesan (Raj Chander), a city youngster, fell in love with Solaiyamma's little sister Kasthuri ([[Saradha Preetha]]). Later, Mayandi and Solaiyamma had an arranged marriage, but Solaiyamma was still afraid of him after the marriage. One night, Mayandi came drunk in his house, molested the innocent Solaiyamma, and brutally raped her. Since that night, Solaiyamma began to avoid Mayandi, and she did not talk to him anymore. A few months later, Solaiyamma discovered that she was pregnant. Mayandi and Solaiyamma were unable to understand their feelings. Finally, Ponnuthayi ([[Srividya]]), Mayandi's adopted mother, brought them back together. Unfortunately, Solaiyamma died after giving birth. Kasthuri then brings up Mayandi's baby. Mayandi, who cannot take care of the baby alone, needs a wife to bring up his baby, and he thinks that Kasthuri would be the perfect mother for his baby. Knowing his plan, Murugesan compels his father Pannaiyar (Nambirajan), a ruthless landlord, to accept for the marriage. Pannaiyar encourages Mayandi to bring back his son Murugesan, but Kasthuri stops it and clearly tells him that she can only be Murugesan. Mayandi decides to arrange Murugesan and Kasthuri's marriage against Pannaiyar's wish.

He was in love with his cousin Solaiyamma ([[Meena (actress)|Meena]]) and wanted to get married to her, but they had nothing in common. The soft-spoken Solaiyamma was afraid of him. In the meantime, Murugesan (Raj Chander), a city youngster, fell in love with Solaiyamma's little sister Kasthuri ([[Saradha Preetha]]). Later, Mayandi and Solaiyamma had an arranged marriage, but Solaiyamma was still afraid of him after the marriage. One night, Mayandi came drunk in his house, molested the innocent Solaiyamma, and brutally raped her. Since that night, Solaiyamma began to avoid Mayandi, and she did not talk to him anymore. A few months later, Solaiyamma discovered that she was pregnant. Mayandi and Solaiyamma were unable to understand their feelings. Finally, Ponnuthayi ([[Srividya]]), Mayandi's adopted mother, brought them back together. Unfortunately, Solaiyamma died after giving birth. Kasthuri then brings up Mayandi's baby. Mayandi, who cannot take care of the baby alone, needs a wife to bring up his baby, and he thinks that Kasthuri would be the perfect mother for his baby. Knowing his plan, Murugesan compels his father Pannaiyar (Nambirajan), a ruthless landlord, to accept for the marriage. Pannaiyar encourages Mayandi to bring back his son Murugesan, but Kasthuri stops it and clearly tells him that she can only be Murugesan. Mayandi decides to arrange Murugesan and Kasthuri's marriage against Pannaiyar's wish. What transpires later forms the crux of the story.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n*[[Rajkiran]] as Mayandi\n*[[Meena (actress)|Meena]] as Solaiyamma\n*Raj Chander as Murugesan\n*[[Saradha Preetha]] as Kasthuri\n*[[Srividya]] as Ponnuthayi\n*Nambirajan as Pannaiyar\n*[[Goundamani]]\n*[[Senthil]]\n*[[Vadivelu]] as Vadivelu\n*[[Dubbing Janaki]] as Seeniamma\n*[[K.

Historically social design has been mindful of the designer's role and responsibility in society, and of the use of the design process to bring about social change.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mica.edu/Programs_of_Study/Graduate_Programs/Social_Design_(MA)/Overview.html|title=Overview M.A. in Social Design (MASD)|last=|first=|date=|website=Maryland Institute College of Art|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2018-03-19}}</ref> Social design is a critical discipline that challenges the pure market-orientedness of conventional design practice, and attempts to see past this into a more inclusive conception of design.

''Ideas and Beliefs in Architecture and Industrial design: How attitudes, orientations, and underlying assumptions shape the built environment''. Oslo School of Architecture and Design. {{ISBN|82-547-0174-1}}.</ref> \n\nThe ideas behind social design has been inspired by [[Victor Papanek]]\u2019s writings, he was one of the first to address issues of social design in the 1960s. He was focused on creating change within the design field and no longer tolerating ''misdesign,'' any design that does not account for the needs of all people and disregards its own environmental consequences.<ref name=\":2\">Papanek, Victor (1984): [https://books.google.com/books/about/Design_for_the_Real_World.html?id=gf5TAAAAMAAJ Design for the Real World]. Academy Chicago Publishers. Completely Revised Second Edition</ref> To be a positive force in society, design and designers need to be socially and morally responsible, designers carry a serious responsibility for the consequences their designs have on society.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.metropolismag.com/design/victor-papanek-politics-design-vitra-museum/|title=Design Provocateur: Revisiting the Prescient Ideas of Victor Papanek|date=2019-01-24|website=Metropolis|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-01}}</ref> These consequences include environmental impact and designers can contribute to designing more considerate and [[ecological]] products by carefully selecting the materials they use.<ref name=\":3\" /> Papanek also remarks on designing for people's needs (rather than their wants) and designers have responsibility over the choices they make in design processes.<ref name=\":2\" /> Often design is detached from the real world and is focused on the commercial market by designing for luxury items or for just a few people based on aesthetics, or disposable items. Papanek emphasizes designers should have a keen eye for where the need is and often that is found by looking at marginalized populations.\n\nAnother author who contributes to the development of social design is [[Victor Margolin]].<ref name=\":1\" /> He writes in the 2002 book, ''The Politics of the Artificial: Essays on Design and Design Studies'' the \"designer's ability to envision and give form on material and immaterial products that can address human problems on broad scale and contribute to social well-being.\" This [[ideology]] is something that social design is built on.<ref>Margolin, Victor (2002): The Politics of the Artificial. Essays on Design and Design Studies. The University of Chicago Press. Chicago and London</ref> In this view social design is an activity that should not be framed with connotations of charity, aid donations, help, etc. It is not voluntary work, but it should be seen as professional contribution that plays a part in local [[economic development]] or livelihood. At the same time Social Design also challenges the conventional market model of designing. While traditionally, Design has been approached as a profession that remains strictly answerable to market forces, social design envisages the possibility of a more distributive conception of surpluses, by ensuring that the benefits of services and systems reach a wider range of user groups who may often fall outside the market system.<ref name=\":1\" /> Margolin writes, \"The primary purpose of design for the market is creating products for sale. Conversely, the foremost intent of social design is the satisfaction of human needs.\"<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nDesigner George Aye writes about the importance of acknowledging the role of power when designing for complex social sector issues, as one may do for social design projects.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/greater-good-studio/design-educations-big-gap-understanding-the-role-of-power-1ee1756b7f08|title=Design Education\u2019s Big Gap: Understanding the Role of Power|last=Aye|first=George|date=2017-06-07|website=Medium|language=en|access-date=2020-04-01}}</ref> Depending on the project, designing for user engagement in a project can be more important than designing for solutions, and it encourages the use of [[human-centered design]] methodologies.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nEngineer [[Chris Cox (Facebook)|Chris Cox]] of [[Facebook]] used the term \"social design\" in 2010 and 2011 as, \"[social design] defines the concept as improving how people build human-to-human, versus human-to-interface, connections online\".<ref>{{Cite news|last=Fowler|first=Geoffrey A.|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704127904575544302659920236|title=Facebook's 'Social' Chief Pushes Human Interaction|date=2010-10-10|work=Wall Street Journal|access-date=2020-04-01|language=en-US|issn=0099-9660}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/facebooks-ethan-beard-driving-engagement-and-growth-through-social-design/|title=Facebook's Ethan Beard: Driving Engagement - and Growth - Through 'Social Design'|date=2011|website=Knowledge@Wharton|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-01|last3=America|first3=North}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fastcompany.com/1665049/a-visit-with-facebooks-vp-of-product-and-his-redesign-team|title=A Visit With Facebook\u2019s VP Of Product, And His Redesign Team|last=Jana|first=Reena|date=2011-09-21|website=Fast Company|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-01}}</ref>  \n\nOutside the design world social design appears in a number of professional environments, there are many artists that use the term social design or [[Social practice (art)|social practice]] to describe their work, though the work is exhibited within the contexts of the art world and have a different dialog when compared to design. \n\n==Initiatives==\n*[[Hasso Plattner Institute of Design]] at [[Stanford University]] has supported innovative social design programs.<ref name=\":0\" />\n*The Archeworks school was founded in 1994 and is located in Chicago, they were early in teaching socially responsible design processes.<ref name=\":1\" />\n*[[Curry Stone Design Prize]] was founded in 2008, a prize focused on design innovation in the social sector.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://designthinking.ideo.com/blog/5-inspiring-social-design-pioneers|title=5 Inspiring Social Design Pioneers|last=|first=|date=2012|website=IDEO|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-01}}</ref>\n*Measured Summit, Design+Health in New York City was founded in 2017, a social design conference centered around the heath care industry.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.metropolismag.com/design/design-education/social-design-a-discipline-in-its-own-right/|title=Social Design: A Discipline In Its Own Right|date=2017-01-20|website=Metropolis|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-01}}</ref>\n*The Center for Social Design at the [[Maryland Institute College of Art]] (MICA) was founded in 2011, and was one of the first graduate level degree programs in social design in the United States.

''Ideas and Beliefs in Architecture and Industrial design: How attitudes, orientations, and underlying assumptions shape the built environment''. Oslo School of Architecture and Design. {{ISBN|82-547-0174-1}}.</ref> \n\nThe ideas behind social design has been inspired by [[Victor Papanek]]\u2019s writings, he was one of the first to address issues of social design in the 1960s. He was focused on creating change within the design field and no longer tolerating ''misdesign,'' any design that does not account for the needs of all people and disregards its own environmental consequences.<ref name=\":2\">Papanek, Victor (1984): [https://books.google.com/books/about/Design_for_the_Real_World.html?id=gf5TAAAAMAAJ Design for the Real World]. Academy Chicago Publishers.

Papanek emphasizes designers should have a keen eye for where the need is and often that is found by looking at marginalized populations.\n\nAnother author who contributes to the development of social design is [[Victor Margolin]].<ref name=\":1\" /> He writes in the 2002 book, ''The Politics of the Artificial: Essays on Design and Design Studies'' the \"designer's ability to envision and give form on material and immaterial products that can address human problems on broad scale and contribute to social well-being.\" This [[ideology]] is something that social design is built on.<ref>Margolin, Victor (2002): The Politics of the Artificial. Essays on Design and Design Studies. The University of Chicago Press. Chicago and London</ref> In this view social design is an activity that should not be framed with connotations of charity, aid donations, help, etc. It is not voluntary work, but it should be seen as professional contribution that plays a part in local [[economic development]] or livelihood. At the same time Social Design also challenges the conventional market model of designing. While traditionally, Design has been approached as a profession that remains strictly answerable to market forces, social design envisages the possibility of a more distributive conception of surpluses, by ensuring that the benefits of services and systems reach a wider range of user groups who may often fall outside the market system.<ref name=\":1\" /> Margolin writes, \"The primary purpose of design for the market is creating products for sale. Conversely, the foremost intent of social design is the satisfaction of human needs.\"<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nDesigner George Aye writes about the importance of acknowledging the role of power when designing for complex social sector issues, as one may do for social design projects.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/greater-good-studio/design-educations-big-gap-understanding-the-role-of-power-1ee1756b7f08|title=Design Education\u2019s Big Gap: Understanding the Role of Power|last=Aye|first=George|date=2017-06-07|website=Medium|language=en|access-date=2020-04-01}}</ref> Depending on the project, designing for user engagement in a project can be more important than designing for solutions, and it encourages the use of [[human-centered design]] methodologies.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nEngineer [[Chris Cox (Facebook)|Chris Cox]] of [[Facebook]] used the term \"social design\" in 2010 and 2011 as, \"[social design] defines the concept as improving how people build human-to-human, versus human-to-interface, connections online\".<ref>{{Cite news|last=Fowler|first=Geoffrey A.|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704127904575544302659920236|title=Facebook's 'Social' Chief Pushes Human Interaction|date=2010-10-10|work=Wall Street Journal|access-date=2020-04-01|language=en-US|issn=0099-9660}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/facebooks-ethan-beard-driving-engagement-and-growth-through-social-design/|title=Facebook's Ethan Beard: Driving Engagement - and Growth - Through 'Social Design'|date=2011|website=Knowledge@Wharton|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-01|last3=America|first3=North}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fastcompany.com/1665049/a-visit-with-facebooks-vp-of-product-and-his-redesign-team|title=A Visit With Facebook\u2019s VP Of Product, And His Redesign Team|last=Jana|first=Reena|date=2011-09-21|website=Fast Company|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-01}}</ref>  \n\nOutside the design world social design appears in a number of professional environments, there are many artists that use the term social design or [[Social practice (art)|social practice]] to describe their work, though the work is exhibited within the contexts of the art world and have a different dialog when compared to design. \n\n==Initiatives==\n*[[Hasso Plattner Institute of Design]] at [[Stanford University]] has supported innovative social design programs.<ref name=\":0\" />\n*The Archeworks school was founded in 1994 and is located in Chicago, they were early in teaching socially responsible design processes.<ref name=\":1\" />\n*[[Curry Stone Design Prize]] was founded in 2008, a prize focused on design innovation in the social sector.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://designthinking.ideo.com/blog/5-inspiring-social-design-pioneers|title=5 Inspiring Social Design Pioneers|last=|first=|date=2012|website=IDEO|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-01}}</ref>\n*Measured Summit, Design+Health in New York City was founded in 2017, a social design conference centered around the heath care industry.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.metropolismag.com/design/design-education/social-design-a-discipline-in-its-own-right/|title=Social Design: A Discipline In Its Own Right|date=2017-01-20|website=Metropolis|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-01}}</ref>\n*The Center for Social Design at the [[Maryland Institute College of Art]] (MICA) was founded in 2011, and was one of the first graduate level degree programs in social design in the United States.
