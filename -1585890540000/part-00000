During a prolonged stay in [[Paris]], he discovered his interest in literature and art. He began working as an art critic, first in Berlin, then in Vienna:  In 1890 he became associate editor of ''Berliner Freie B\u00fchne'' (\u201cBerlin Free Stage\u201d), and later became associate editor and critic of the ''Deutsche Zeitung'' (\u201cGerman Newspaper\u201d). In 1894 he began publication of ''Die Zeit'' (\u201cThe Times\u201d), and was also editor of the ''Neue Wiener Tagblatt'' (\u201cNew Vienna Daily Flyer\u201d) and the ''Oesterreichische Volkszeitung'' (\u201cAustrian Popular Newspaper\u201d).\n\nFrom 1906\u20131907, he worked as a director with [[Max Reinhardt (theatre director)|Max Reinhardt]] at the German Theater ({{lang-de|Deutsches Theater}}) in [[Berlin]], and starting in 1918 he was a [[Dramaturg]] with the Vienna [[Burgtheater]].\n\nSpokesman for the literary group [[Young Vienna]], Bahr was an active member of the Austrian avant-garde, producing both criticism and [[Impressionism (literature)|Impressionist]] plays. Bahr's association with the coffeehouse literati made him one of the main targets of [[Karl Kraus (writer)|Karl Kraus]]'s satirical journal ''[[Die Fackel]]'' (''The Torch'') after Kraus's falling out with the group.\n\nBahr was the first critic to apply the label [[modernism]] to literary works, and was an early observer of the [[Expressionism]] movement. His theoretical papers were important in the definition of new literary categories. His 40 plays and around 10 novels never reached the quality of his theoretical work.

It is directed by William Lau and stars the voice of [[Kelly Sheridan]] as the Barbie protagonists, Anneliese and Erika. The film is loosely inspired by the [[Mark Twain]] novel ''[[The Prince and the Pauper]]'', but unrelated to the 1939 film ''[[The Princess and the Pauper]]''. It is the first Barbie classic film that completely excludes fantastic elements (fairies, magic, mermaids, etc), which were a usual part of Barbie franchise.\n\nSongs for the film are written by [[Amy Powers]], Megan Cavallari and Rob Hudnut, who also executive produced the film.\n\n==Plot==\nIn an unnamed kingdom, a [[blonde]] [[princess]] and a [[brunette]] [[pauper]] are born at the same time. Several years later, the Princess, Anneliese, is betrothed by her mother, Queen Genevieve, to the wealthy King Dominick to save the nearly bankrupt royal treasury, but she is in love with her young tutor, Julian. The Pauper, Erika, is an [[indentured servant]] at Madame Carp's Dress Emporium, working off her parents' debt, but dreams of becoming a singer and seeing the world.\n\nUnbeknownst to the Queen, the reason behind the kingdom's bankruptcy is her adviser, Preminger, has been stealing the gold from the royal mines. Upon learning from his henchmen, Nick and Nack, that the Queen has arranged Anneliese's marriage to King Dominick, he decides to make Anneliese mysteriously disappear, which will cancel the engagement, then Preminger can pretend that he has found her and earn her hand in marriage, allowing him to accede the throne and become king.\n\nJulian takes Anneliese for a day out into the kingdom so that she can be free for once. Anneliese hears Erika, who is performing in the street to earn money for herself, but Madame Carp collects it as part of her debt. Anneliese and Erika meet and learn they are identical, apart from their hair color and the crown-shaped birthmark on Anneliese's shoulder. The two bond over their shared troubles and become fast friends. That night, Anneliese and her cat Serafina are abducted by Nick and Nack, who leave a false letter saying she ran away.\n\nJulian, doubting the letter, asks Erika to impersonate the Princess, saving the engagement while he investigates Anneliese's disappearance. Preminger is surprised when Erika, disguised as Anneliese, presents herself at the palace. King Dominick introduces himself to the disguised Erika; over time, the two fall in love, but Erika is worried about what will happen if she is found out.\n\nThe real Anneliese escapes Nick and Nack, but is turned away from the palace because the guards think the Princess (Erika) is already inside. Mistaking Anneliese for Erika, Madame Carp forces Anneliese into her shop and locks her inside. A suspicious Julian follows Preminger to the house where Anneliese was being kept and overhears Preminger's plans to become the king, but is discovered and captured.\n\nAnneliese uses her cat Serafina to take her ring and a tag from the dress shop so someone can find her. Unfortunately, Preminger and his dog Midas intercept her. Preminger takes Anneliese to the royal mines where she is imprisoned with Julian after Nick and Nack cause a cave-in. Preminger goes back to the palace, exposes Erika as a fake and has her imprisoned. Preminger convinces the Queen that Anneliese is dead and that they must marry to save the kingdom; with no other options, she reluctantly agrees.\n\nErika escapes the dungeon by singing a lullaby, causing the guard to fall asleep, and taking his keys. She bumps into King Dominick who tells her that he doesn't believe Preminger's claims about her. Meanwhile, Anneliese and Julian find out how to restore the kingdom's resources with some geodes filled with crystals; the two then confess their love for each other. Erika's barking cat, Wolfie, unearths a mine shaft and the group escapes by flooding the room and floating towards the surface in a barrel.\n\nAt the Queen and Preminger's wedding, Anneliese arrives, proves her identity with her birthmark, and reveals the truth about Preminger, who is soon arrested along with Nick and Nack. Anneliese tells her mother that she wants to marry Julian and that they can help the kingdom. Thanks to the crystals in the mine, the kingdom is saved; Madame Carp goes out of business, and, with her debt finally paid, Erika leaves to become a renowned singer. After touring the world, Erika realizes where her heart is and decides to return home to marry Dominick. Anneliese and Erika have a double wedding and they and their husbands ride off in a carriage together.\n\n==Voice cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n*[[Kelly Sheridan]] as Princess Anneliese / Erika / Narrator<ref>{{cite web|title=Barbie as the Princess and the Pauper|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0426955/fullcredits|publisher=IMDb|accessdate=23 January 2013}}</ref> \n**Melissa Lyons as Princess Anneliese (singing voice)\n**[[Julie Stevens (American actress and singer)|Julie Stevens]] as Erika (singing voice)\n*[[Alessandro Juliani]] as Julian\n*[[Mark Hildreth (actor)|Mark Hildreth]] as King Dominick\n**Mark Luna as King Dominick (singing voice)\n*[[Martin Short]] as Preminger (the sexiest man alive aka how can I refuse?)\n*[[Kathleen Barr]] as Serafina / Bertie\n*[[Ian James Corlett]] as Wolfie \n*Ellen Kennedy as Queen Genevieve\n*[[Pam Hyatt]] as Madame Carp\n*[[Brian Drummond]] as Nick \n*[[Jan Rabson]] as Nack / Midas\n*[[Colin Murdock (voice actor)|Colin Murdock]] as the Royal Scheduler\n*[[Janyse Jaud]] as a Palace Maid\n*[[Lee Tockar]] as Ambassador Bismarck \n*[[Garry Chalk]] as Herve\n*Roger Monk as the Minister\n}}\n\n==Soundtrack==\nThis film is the first musical in the series of [[Barbie]] CGI films.

His father, Johann Anzengruber, left the family home at an early age and moved to Vienna, where he found work as a bookkeeper in the treasury of the Austrian crown lands.  In 1838 he married Maria Herbich, the daughter of a petit bourgeois pharmacist.  It is not surprising that the social standing of his parents - his father, from peasant stock, and his mother, a petty bourgeois - regularly played an important role in Ludwig Anzengruber's later works.\n\nLudwig's greatest influence in becoming a dramatist was his father who himself had been a secret poet in the style of [[Friedrich Schiller]], but without success. Only one of his plays, on the subject of [[Berthold Schwarz]], was produced, and probably only because of the spectacular explosion at the end; his other works gathered dust in the drawer of his desk.\n\n== Early life and career ==\nLudwig was only 5 years old when his father died in 1844.  His mother, who was to become the most important person in his life as the years went on, tried to make ends meet with her meager [[widow's pension]] of 166 [[guilder]]s and 40 [[kreuzer]]s.  In 1854 when Ludwig\u2019s grandmother, who had been supporting her daughter and grandchild substantially, died, his home and living arrangements became even worse.  Financial emergencies drained their savings, but Ludwig's mother was ready to make any sacrifice (including taking up work as a seamstress) so that he could study at the Paulaner elementary school from 1847 to 1850 and then at the [[piarists|Piarist]] high school from 1851 to 1853.  In 1855 he dropped out of school due to increasingly bad grades and from 1856 to 1858 he was an apprentice at the Sallmeyer bookstore.  During his employment at the bookstore he was able to read a great deal, but after disagreements with his master his [[apprenticeship]] came to an abrupt end.\n\nAt the age of 19, after a severe bout of [[typhoid]], Ludwig decided to become an actor.  Over the next ten years he tried his luck as a professional actor, travelling with different acting troupes throughout the provinces of Austria. He worked as a supporting actor in many a second-rate theatre, without, however, displaying any marked talent, and he never made the breakthrough to success, although his stage experience later stood him in good stead. One thing that hindered him was the [[dialect]] that he spoke, a dialect he was never able completely to get rid of.  From 1866 he returned to live in Vienna again.  During this time he wrote several [[drama]]s and some [[short story|short stories]], but these were unsuccessful.\n\n== Creative period ==\nIn 1869 he found his way back into bourgeois society, when he took a job as a clerk (probably because he badly needed money) in the imperial police headquarters in Vienna.  In 1870, under the pseudonym '''L. Gruber''', he wrote what was to be his breakthrough, his anti-clerical drama ''[[Der Pfarrer von Kirchfeld]]'' (''The Priest from Kirchfeld'').  The play was first produced at the ''[[Theater an der Wien]]'', and its premiere on 5 November was a great success.  [[Heinrich Laube]], the head of the ''[[Burgtheater]]'', wrote an enthusiastic review and through this Ludwig struck up a friendship with [[Peter Rosegger]].  His overnight success meant that the ''police official (4th class)'' could step off the career ladder of the civil service and devote himself entirely to literature, which saved him from conflict between being a poet and his duty to his office.\n\nIn 1873, despite his mother's warnings, Anzengruber married the 16-year-old Adelinde Lipka (1857-1914).  His young bride, the sister of his childhood friend Franz Lipka, was not up to the demands of practical life, and thus there were repeated crises in their marriage, although Ludwig's considerable debts and very close relationship with his mother were often also to blame for this.  Despite their three children, divorce was inevitable, and in 1889 the couple separated officially.\n\nThe following years were very successful for Anzengruber.  His plays were produced throughout Europe, though his mother was never able to fully share in his success, as she had died in 1875.  From April 1882 until May 1885 he was the editor of the Viennese paper ''Die Heimat'' (''The Homeland''), in May 1884 he became a contributing editor of the Viennese weekly magazine ''[[Figaro (Vienna)|Figaro]]'' and in August 1888 he became the editor of the ''Wiener Bote'' (''Vienna Messenger'').\n\nIn September 1888 he was given the position of [[dramaturg]] for the ''[[Volkstheater Wien]]'' in Vienna, which opened on 14 September 1889 with his piece ''Der Fleck auf der Ehr'' (''The Stain on Honour'').\n\nAt the end of November, the dramatist, who was only fifty years old, became sick with [[anthrax]], and not two weeks later died as a result of blood poisoning.\n\n==Selected works==\n\n=== Dramas ===\nMost of Anzengruber's plays deal with Austrian peasant life.
