The principal islands are about {{convert|300|mi|km|0|abbr=off}} east of [[South America]]'s southern [[Patagonia]]n coast, and about {{convert|752|mi|km|0|abbr=off}} from the [[Cape Dubouzet|northern tip]] of the [[Antarctic Peninsula]], at a latitude of about 52\u00b0S. The archipelago, with an area of {{convert|4700|sqmi|km2|abbr=off}}, comprises [[East Falkland]], [[West Falkland]] and 776 smaller islands. As a [[British Overseas Territories|British overseas territory]], the Falklands have internal [[self-governance]], and the United Kingdom takes responsibility for their defence and foreign affairs. The Falkland Islands' capital is [[Stanley, Falkland Islands|Stanley]] on East Falkland.\n\nControversy exists over the Falklands' discovery and subsequent colonisation by Europeans. At various times, the islands have had French, British, Spanish, and Argentine settlements. Britain [[Reassertion of British sovereignty over the Falkland Islands (1833)|reasserted its rule in 1833]], but Argentina maintains its [[Falkland Islands sovereignty dispute|claim to the islands]]. In April 1982, Argentine military forces [[1982 invasion of the Falkland Islands|invaded the islands]]. British administration was restored two months later at the end of the [[Falklands War]].

Other ethnicities include French, [[Gibraltarians|Gibraltarian]] and Scandinavian. Immigration from the United Kingdom, the South Atlantic island of [[Saint Helena]], and [[Chile]] has reversed a population decline. The predominant (and official) language is English. Under the [[British Nationality (Falkland Islands) Act 1983]], Falkland Islanders are [[British nationality law|British citizens]].\n\nThe islands lie on the boundary of the [[Oceanic climate|subantarctic oceanic]] and [[tundra climate]] zones, and both major islands have mountain ranges reaching  {{convert|700|m|ft|order=flip}}. They are home to large bird populations, although many no longer breed on the main islands because of competition from [[introduced species]]. Major economic activities include fishing, tourism and sheep farming, with an emphasis on high-quality wool exports. Oil exploration, licensed by the [[Falkland Islands Government]], remains controversial as a result of maritime disputes with Argentina.\n\n== Etymology ==\n{{see also|List of Falkland Islands placenames}}\n\nThe name \"Falkland Islands\" comes from [[Falkland Sound]], the [[strait]] that separates the two main islands.{{sfn|Jones|2009|p = 73}} The name \"Falkland\" was applied to the channel by [[John Strong (mariner)|John Strong]], captain of an English expedition which landed on the islands in 1690. Strong named the strait in honour of [[Anthony Cary, 5th Viscount of Falkland]], the [[Treasurer of the Navy]] who sponsored his journey.<ref>See:\n* {{harvnb|Dotan|2010|p = 165}},\n* {{harvnb|Room|2006|p = 129}}.</ref> The Viscount's title originates from the town of [[Falkland, Fife|Falkland]], Scotland\u2014the town's name likely comes from a [[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]] term referring to an \"enclosure\" (''lann''),{{efn-ua|According to researcher Simon Taylor, the exact Gaelic etymology is unclear as the \"falk\" in the name could have stood for \"hidden\" (''falach''), \"wash\" (''failc''), or \"heavy rain\" (''falc'').{{sfn|Taylor|M\u00e1rkus|2005|p=158}}}} but it could less plausibly be from the Anglo-Saxon term \"folkland\" (land held by [[Anglo-Saxon law#Folk-right and privilege|folk-right]]).{{sfn|Room|2006|p = 129}} The name \"Falklands\" was not applied to the islands until 1765, when [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] captain [[John Byron]] of the [[Royal Navy]], claimed them for [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]] as \"Falkland's Islands\".<ref>See:\n* {{harvnb|Paine|2000|p = 45}},\n* {{harvnb|Room|2006|p = 129}}.</ref> The term \"Falklands\" is a standard abbreviation used to refer to the islands.\n\nThe Spanish name for the archipelago, ''Islas Malvinas'', derives from the French ''\u00celes Malouines''\u2014the name given to the islands by [[Kingdom of France|French]] explorer [[Louis-Antoine de Bougainville]] in 1764.{{sfn|Hince|2001|p = 121}} Bougainville, who founded the islands' first settlement, named the area after the port of [[Saint-Malo]] (the point of departure for his ships and colonists).<ref>See:\n* {{harvnb|Hince|2001|p = 121}},\n* {{harvnb|Room|2006|p = 129}}.</ref> The port, located in the [[Brittany]] region of western France, was named after [[Malo (saint)|St. Malo]] (or Maclou), the Christian [[Evangelism|evangelist]] who founded the city.{{sfn|Balmaceda|2011|loc = Chapter 36}}\n\nAt the twentieth session of the [[United Nations General Assembly]], the [[United Nations Fourth Committee|Fourth Committee]] determined that, in all languages other than Spanish, all UN documentation would designate the territory as ''Falkland Islands (Malvinas)''.

The principal islands are about {{convert|300|mi|km|0|abbr=off}} east of [[South America]]'s southern [[Patagonia]]n coast, and about {{convert|752|mi|km|0|abbr=off}} from the [[Cape Dubouzet|northern tip]] of the [[Antarctic Peninsula]], at a latitude of about 52\u00b0S. The archipelago, with an area of {{convert|4700|sqmi|km2|abbr=off}}, comprises [[East Falkland]], [[West Falkland]] and 776 smaller islands. As a [[British Overseas Territories|British overseas territory]], the Falklands have internal [[self-governance]], and the United Kingdom takes responsibility for their defence and foreign affairs. The Falkland Islands' capital is [[Stanley, Falkland Islands|Stanley]] on East Falkland.\n\nControversy exists over the Falklands' discovery and subsequent colonisation by Europeans. At various times, the islands have had French, British, Spanish, and Argentine settlements. Britain [[Reassertion of British sovereignty over the Falkland Islands (1833)|reasserted its rule in 1833]], but Argentina maintains its [[Falkland Islands sovereignty dispute|claim to the islands]]. In April 1982, Argentine military forces [[1982 invasion of the Falkland Islands|invaded the islands]]. British administration was restored two months later at the end of the [[Falklands War]]. Almost all Falklanders [[2013 Falkland Islands sovereignty referendum|favour]] the archipelago remaining a UK overseas territory. Its sovereignty status is part of an ongoing [[Falkland Islands sovereignty dispute|dispute between Argentina and the United Kingdom]].\n\nThe population (3,398 inhabitants in 2016)<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fig.gov.fk/policy/index.php/component/jdownloads/finish/5-statistics/4788-falkland-islands-census-2016-report/0?Itemid=0#page=14|title=2016 Census Report|year=2017|publisher=Policy and Economic Development Unit, Falkland Islands Government|format=PDF|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180124232820/http://www.fig.gov.fk/policy/index.php/component/jdownloads/finish/5-statistics/4788-falkland-islands-census-2016-report/0?Itemid=0|archive-date=24 January 2018|url-status=}}</ref> consists primarily of native-born [[Falkland Islanders]], the majority of British descent. Other ethnicities include French, [[Gibraltarians|Gibraltarian]] and Scandinavian. Immigration from the United Kingdom, the South Atlantic island of [[Saint Helena]], and [[Chile]] has reversed a population decline. The predominant (and official) language is English. Under the [[British Nationality (Falkland Islands) Act 1983]], Falkland Islanders are [[British nationality law|British citizens]].\n\nThe islands lie on the boundary of the [[Oceanic climate|subantarctic oceanic]] and [[tundra climate]] zones, and both major islands have mountain ranges reaching  {{convert|700|m|ft|order=flip}}. They are home to large bird populations, although many no longer breed on the main islands because of competition from [[introduced species]].

He proceeded to join a dance band, where he witnessed an early brass band competition. In 1851 he arranged a contest in [[Kingston upon Hull]], but his first success came in 1853 at [[Manchester]]'s [[Belle Vue Zoological Gardens]], where he helped organise a successful contest of brass bands. He began writing test pieces and in 1860 was approached to run a competition at [[The Crystal Palace]] in London. This event proved highly successful, and ran annually until 1863.\n\nFollowing the Crystal Palace contests, he toured the world with a variety of groups and acts, acting both as a manager and musical director. He then retired to [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire|Scarborough]] to paint and write articles on music, and eventually died on [[Good Friday]], 1903. In his articles, he stated that his mission throughout his life was \"the propagation of music amongst the working classes\".<ref name=HerbertMyers2010/>{{rp|576}}\n\n==Early life and education==\nJackson was born in the Mytongate area of [[Kingston upon Hull]]. His father, John Jackson, was from a line of tallow [[candlemaker|chandlers]] and soap boilers.<ref name=ODNBJackson>{{cite web |last1=Herbert |first1=Trevor |title=Jackson, (John) Enderby (1827\u20131903), musician and impresario |url=https://doi.org/10.1093/ref:odnb/56196 |website=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography |accessdate=5 April 2020 |language=en |doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/56196}}</ref> He attended [[Hull Grammar School]] and received private music tuition alongside it, becoming proficient on the flute, French horn, and piano.

He later claimed to have watched [[Louis Jullien]]'s extravagant and talented orchestra perform while placing candles in Hull's Theatre Royal, which inspired him to leave the family business and focus on music instead.<ref name=HerbertMyers2010/>{{rp|573}} \n\nHe made his first public performance on the trumpet at the age of nine in the band of brothers Thomas and John Martin.<ref name=RussellElliot1936/>{{rp|48}} At eighteen, he was playing the flute in the Quadrille Band at [[Burton Constable Hall]]. While playing at a pageant in the hall, he witnessed \"an afternoon's rivalry of brass bands\", being a minor competition between groups.<ref name=RussellElliot1936/>{{rp|79-80}}\n\n==Brass band contests==\nWhile there is minor evidence of small brass band contests prior to Jackson, it is believed that the modern form is traced to his actions.<ref name=HerbertMyers2010/>{{rp|573}} Alongside the performance at Burton Constable, his idea of brass band contests came from watching the large crowds at competitive agricultural events, and considering the idea that competition could be mixed with entertainment to gain even more of an audience.<ref name=HerbertMyers2010/>{{rp|576}}\n\nIn the summer of 1851, Jackson held his first contest in Hull. While the number of brass bands in the country had increased throughout the 1840s, most of the bands at this first contest did not exist until December 1850: he spent a lot of time encouraging locals to form bands and compete.

The 1860 Crystal Palace event was split into two contests on consecutive days: each had six preliminary rounds held around the grounds, with the finals taking place in the concert pavilion. Winning bands were given trophies, a cash prize of between \u00a35 and \u00a340, sets of music journals, and instruments worth up to \u00a335; the best soloists were also given new instruments.<ref name=HerbertMyers2010/>{{rp|571-2}} Each day finished with a mass concert, performed by almost 1,400 of the contestants: the performance contained Handel's ''[[Messiah Part II#44|Hallelujah Chorus]]'', Mendelssohn's ''[[Wedding March (Mendelssohn)|Wedding March]]'', and Haydn's ''[[The Creation (Haydn)#13|The Heavens Are Telling]]'', ''[[Rule, Britannia!]]'', and ''[[God Save the Queen]]''.<ref name=HerbertMyers2010/>{{rp|577-8}} These performances were conducted by Jackson.<ref name=RussellElliot1936/>{{rp|114}}\n\nIn order to judge the competition, an eighteen-person adjudicating panel was organised with Jackson as the referee.

It was devoted to intelligence gathering and covert [[Espionage|spying]] operation for purposes of national security and defense. It was originally headed by [[Dai Li]], and after 1946 he was succeeded by [[Mao Renfeng]]. This bureau was largely superseded by the '''Military Intelligence Bureau''' under [[Ministry of National Defense (Republic of China)|Ministry of National Defense]] in [[Taiwan]] today.\n\nThe NBIS had a great influence amongst the [[Nationalist Government]]'s military, police, administration, and transportation agencies, as well as embassies and consulates abroad during the [[Political Tutelage]] period (1928-1946) of [[Republic of China (1912\u201349)|Republic of China]]. It was often criticized by the political dissidents as a \"secret police\" involving in covert and espionage operation, including surveillance, kidnapping, assassinations, elimination and house-arrest against Chinese communists, Japanese spies as well as political dissidents.\n \nDuring the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Sino-Japanese War]], the NBIS was involved in a number of counter-intelligence and covert espionage warfare against the Japanese invaders. There were NBIS agents who defected to Japanese, and many of the secret police in [[Wang Jingwei]]'s Japanese-occupied areas were former NBIS agents.\n\nFrom a historical perspective, NBIS played an important role in [[Second Sino-Japanese War]]. Under the leadership of [[Dai Li]], the [[Nationalist Government]] had a body of 100,000 active spies involving in espionage warfare against Japanese, as well as against the [[Wang Jingwei]]-led puppet Nationalist Government of the Japanese-occupied areas.\n\n== History ==\n=== Early stages ===\nThe NBIS was founded in 1927 as the \"Military Commission of Clandestine Investigation Section of the [[National Revolutionary Army]]\" ({{zh|c=\u570b\u6c11\u9769\u547d\u8ecd\u7e3d\u53f8\u4ee4\u90e8\u5bc6\u67e5\u7d44}})  with the \"Special Works Department\"({{zh|c=\u570b\u6c11\u653f\u5e9c\u8ecd\u4e8b\u59d4\u54e1\u6703\u7279\u52d9\u8655}}) set up in 1932. When the \"Investigation and Statistics Bureau\" was established under the Military Commission, the \"Special Works Department\" was incorporated into the Bureau and renamed the \"Second Division\", and is responsible for intelligence collection and personnel training. All of the bureau's affairs were under the direct command of [[Chiang Kai-shek]]. Dai sought to make the ''Juntong'' into an extended family with himself as the stern paternal figure, stressing traditional Chinese Confucian values of filial piety, loyalty, benevolence, and righteousness.<ref>Wen-hsin Yeh \"Dai Li and the Liu Geqing Affair: Heroism in the Chinese Secret Service During the War of Resistance\" pages 545-562 from ''The Journal of Asian Studies'', Volume 48, Issue #3 August 1989 pages 546-547 {{harv|Yeh|1989|p=546-547}}</ref> The ''Juntong'' operated as a traditional sworn brotherhood with all of the senior officers taking an oath making themselves into \"brothers\".<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p547>Wen-hsin Yeh \"Dai Li and the Liu Geqing Affair: Heroism in the Chinese Secret Service During the War of Resistance\" pages 545-562 from ''The Journal of Asian Studies'', Volume 48, Issue #3 August 1989 page 547</ref> The inspiration for the ''Juntong'' were the secret sworn brotherhoods portrayed in the classics of Chinese literature like ''Water Margin'' and ''The Romance of the Three Kingdoms''.<ref>Wen-hsin Yeh \"Dai Li and the Liu Geqing Affair: Heroism in the Chinese Secret Service During the War of Resistance\" pages 545-562 from ''The Journal of Asian Studies'', Volume 48, Issue #3 August 1989 page 546</ref> Dai presented himself as a stern Confucian father figure to the men and women of the ''Juntong'' and liked to quote from book ''The Dynastic History of the Han'' is \"Is personal happiness possible before the extermination of the Xiongnu?\"<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p547/> Reflecting this mentality, the men and women serving in the ''Juntong'' were forbidden to marry and expected to be celibate as their only love was to be China.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p547/> The rules about celibacy were not always followed as Liu Gequing, the ''Juntong'' ace assassin fell in love with and had a relationship with a fellow agent, Lu Ti, during his time in Shanghai.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p556>Wen-hsin Yeh \"Dai Li and the Liu Geqing Affair: Heroism in the Chinese Secret Service During the War of Resistance\" pages 545\u2013562 from ''The Journal of Asian Studies'', Volume 48, Issue #3 August 1989 page 556.</ref> Likewise, ''Juntong'' agents were expected to forsake smoking, gambling and playing mahjong as Dai wanted them to hard work and dedicate their lives totally to China.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p547/> Reflecting this ethos of absolute dedication to the cause, many of the assassination missions that ''Juntong'' agents were sent on against the Chinese Communists and later on during the war with Japan were known to be suicide missions as the expectation was that ''Juntong'' agents were to value China more than their own lives.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p548>Wen-hsin Yeh \"Dai Li and the Liu Geqing Affair: Heroism in the Chinese Secret Service During the War of Resistance\" pages 545-562 from ''The Journal of Asian Studies'', Volume 48, Issue #3 August 1989 page 548</ref> Dai often said that the ''Juntong'' were to serve Chiang \"like dogs and horses serving their masters without a mind of their own\" as Dai presented Chiang as \"the Leader\" to whom all Chinese had to obey unconditionally.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p548/> As the world of espionage was a secretive one, ''Juntong'' agents were advised that they were to be \"anonymous heroes\" whose deeds would not be remembered by historians.<ref

48, Issue #3 August 1989 page 549</ref>\n\n''Juntong'' agents tended to come from the provincial schools as Dai disliked recruiting those who attended universities, whom the xenophobic, ultra-conservative Dai felt were too exposed to Western influence to fit into the ''Juntong''.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p549/> ''Juntong'' agents, especially those working as assassins were generally expected to know martial arts before joining, both to improve their skills at killing and because Dai felt the sort of self-discipline needed to master the martial arts was the same sort of dedication that he expected in his agents.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p549/> Reflecting Dai's traditionalism, the model for the ''Juntong'' were the assassins of the Warring States period and those portrayed in ''The Romance of the Three Kingdoms''.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p549/> One of the most best loved books among the ''Juntong'' was the novel ''Jianghu qixia zhuan'' (''Legendary Roving Knights of the Rivers and Lakes''), a ''[[wuxia]]'' (martial arts) book that was very popular in Republican China.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p549/> Dai liked the book so much that he recruited the ''kung fu'' master who was said to be the inspiration for the hero of ''Jianghu qixia zhuan'' into the ''Juntong''.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p549/> The men and women of the ''Juntong'' liked to see themselves as \"knights\" who would use their skills to defend the weak from the strong and save China from its enemies.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p549/> A disproportionate number of the men and women of the ''Juntong'' came from the provinces of Hunan, Guangdong, and Zhejiang, all places where Western influence was limited and traditional values flourished.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p549/>\n\nIn 1938, the Special Works Department was expanded and took over the \"Investigation and Statistics Bureau\" to cope with the increasingly demanding tasks of intelligence operations. [[Dai Li]] was assigned as the ''de facto'' responsibility for running the unit.  Dai's preference for recruiting on the basis of familial loyalties, where one sibling would recruit other siblings to the ''Juntong'' proved to be a weakness, when in 1938 a number of ''Juntong'' agents defected over to work for the \"reformed\" government of [[Wang Jingwei]], pitting brother literally against brother.<ref>Wen-hsin Yeh \"Dai Li and the Liu Geqing Affair: Heroism in the Chinese Secret Service During the War of Resistance\" pages 545-562 from ''The Journal of Asian Studies'', Volume 48, Issue #3 August 1989 pages 549-550</ref>\n\n=== Sino-Japanese War period ===\nDuring the Sino-Japanese War, NBIS had orchestrated the assassinations of several key Japanese enemy military and government personnel. Between 1937-41, the ''Juntong'', working together with the Green Gang triad, carried out 150 assassinations of Chinese collaborators and 40 Japanese officers in Shanghai alone.<ref name=FJp356>Fenby, Jonathan ''Chiang Kai-Shek China's Generalissimo and the Nation He Lost'', New York : Carrol & Graf, 2004 page 356.{{harv|Fenby|2004|p=356}}</ref><ref name=Wen-hsinYehp552>Wen-hsin Yeh \"Dai Li and the Liu Geqing Affair: Heroism in the Chinese Secret Service During the War of Resistance\" pages 545\u2013562 from ''The Journal of Asian Studies'', Volume 48, Issue #3 August 1989 page 552.</ref> The ''Juntong'' favored assassinating Chinese collaborators over the Japanese partly because they were easier to kill as the Japanese tended to stick to certain enclaves, but mostly to prevent the Japanese from imposing any sort of ordered government in parts of China they had occupied.<ref name=Wen-hsinYehp551>Wen-hsin Yeh \"Dai Li and the Liu Geqing Affair: Heroism in the Chinese Secret Service During the War of Resistance\" pages 545\u2013562 from ''The Journal of Asian Studies'', Volume 48, Issue #3 August 1989 page 551.</ref> Japan had occupied vast sections of China inhabited by millions of people requiring hundreds of thousands of civil servants to administer while the number of Japanese who were fluent in Mandarin or Cantonese was limited, and to a very large extent the Japanese depended upon Chinese collaborators to administer China for them.<ref name=Wen-hsinYehp551/> Zhang Xiaolin, a leading member of the Green Gang who went over to the Japanese in 1937 was gunned down by a ''Juntong'' assassin.<ref name=FJp356/> In October 1938, [[Tang Shaoyi]], a former prime minister of the Republic of China who had agreed to serve the Japanese was killed at his home when a ''Juntong'' assassin posing as an antique dealer used the antique axe he was showing to Tang to smash in his head.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p550>Wen-hsin Yeh \"Dai Li and the Liu Geqing Affair: Heroism in the Chinese Secret Service During the War of Resistance\" pages 545-562 from ''The Journal of Asian Studies'', Volume 48, Issue #3 August 1989 page 550</ref> As the Japanese had no idea of who the ''Juntong'' assassins were, they restored to lashing out by executing at random innocent people who had nothing to do with the assassinations.<ref name=Wen-hsinYehp552/>\n\nOn Chinese New Year (18 February 1939), four ''Juntong'' agents assassinated Chen Lu, the foreign minister of the [[Wang Jingwei]] puppet government as he paying respects to his ancestors in his mansion in the French Concession of Shanghai.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p550/> Led by the ''Juntong'' ace assassin Liu Geqing, he and three others entered Chen's mansion as two of his bodyguards let them in, machine-gunned Chen down as he paying his respects before the family shrine, and then draped over his corpse a scroll reading \"Death to Collaborators! Long Live Generalissimo Chiang Kai-Shek!\".<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p550/> Fu Xiaoan, the banker and shipping tycoon who had long been an enemy of the Kuomintang and had thrown in his lot with the Japanese, becoming the collaborating mayor of Shanghai, was hacked to death with a meat chopper in his bed by his cook who was secretly a ''Juntong'' assassin.<ref name=FJp356/> In 1939, a banquet to celebrate the friendship between Japan and the [[Wang Jingwei]] regime attended by senior Japanese officers and Chinese collaborators in Shanghai were ruined when the cooks, many of whom were working for the ''Juntong'' poisoned the food, and only prompt medical attention that required pumping the stomachs of the guests prevented hundreds of deaths.<ref name=FJp357>Fenby, Jonathan ''Chiang Kai-Shek China's Generalissimo and the Nation He Lost'', New York : Carrol & Graf, 2004 page 357.</ref> Later in 1939, a train that carrying various Japanese officers and officials of the Wang Jingwei regime from Shanghai to Nanking for a ceremony marking a new treaty that was meant to cement Wang's regime in its place in the \"New Order in Asia\" was blown up by ''Juntong'' agents, killing 74 and wounding hundreds more.<ref name=FJp357/>\n\nThe chief enemy of the ''Juntong'' in Shanghai were not the Japanese, most of whom did not speak Mandarin and even those who did speak Mandarin did so with a Japanese accent that betrayed where they were from, but rather the secret service loyal to the Wang regime that was based in the Huxi \"badlands\" district in Shanghai headed by [[Ding Mocun]] and Li Shiqun, two former Communists  who defected over to the ''Juntong'' before going over to the Japanese.<ref name=FJp357/><ref name=Wen-hsinYehp552/> The No. 76 organization as it was known after its address at 76 Jessfield Road was founded in February 1939 when Ding and Li presented themselves to General [[Kenji Doihara]], the chief of Japanese intelligence in China, at a restaurant in Shanghai's \"Little Tokyo\" district, and proclaimed their willingness to serve Japan, stating as former ''Juntong'' agents that they were the only men who could beat the ''Juntong'' at its own game.<ref name=Wen-hsinYehp552/> On 1 March 1939, the No. 76 organization came into being, and its liaison officer was Colonel Haruke Yoshitane of the Plum Blossom Agency, who in turn reported to Colonel Kagesa Sadaaki of the ''[[Kempeitai]]'', the much feared Japanese military police.<ref name=Wen-hsinYehp552/> On 8 May 1939, Wu Shibao, a Green Gang member and the leader of \"a gang of local thugs and bullies\" agreed to become Li's bodyguard and to provide the \"muscle\" for the No. 76 organization.<ref name=Wen-hsinYehp553>Wen-hsin Yeh \"Dai Li and the Liu Geqing Affair: Heroism in the Chinese Secret Service During the War of Resistance\" pages 545-562 from ''The Journal of Asian Studies'', Volume 48, Issue #3 August 1989 page 553</ref> Li boosted in a speech \"With the left hand we'll annihilate the Blue Shirts, with the right we'll knock down the C.C Clique!\".<ref name=Wen-hsinYehp553/> The No. 76 organization, which moved into its base at No. 76 Jessfield Road in July 1939, was based in a mansion that had once belonged to the warlord General Chen Diaoyuan that was turned into a fortress with concrete blocks on the drive-way and electrified iron gates as both Ding and Li had an obsessive fear of assassination.<ref name=Wen-hsinYehp552/>\n\nAs both Ding and Li had been senior ''Juntong'' agents until 1938 with Ding heading the Third Section of the Military Affairs Bureau until late 1938 while Li had been a member of the Green Gang, the two men knew the ''Juntong'' very well and in many ways the No. 76 organization was a mirror image of the ''Juntong''.<ref name=Wen-hsinYehp553/> The collaborating secret police assassinated anti-Japanese Chinese; had powers to arrest without warrant, torture and to kill extrajudicially; kidnapped businessmen for ransom; and were deeply involved in organized crime, charging a \"fee\" to all of the opium dens, brothels and casinos of Shanghai to allow them to operate.<ref name=FJp357/> In September 1939, Wang Tianmu, the chief ''Juntong'' agent in Shanghai was kidnapped on the Nanjing road by No. 76 agents, was taken to 76 Jessfield Road where he was held for three weeks before being released.<ref name=Wen-hsinYehp554>Wen-hsin Yeh \"Dai Li and the Liu Geqing Affair: Heroism in the Chinese Secret Service During the War of Resistance\" pages 545\u2013562 from ''The Journal of Asian Studies'', Volume 48, Issue #3 August 1989 page 554.</ref> Suspecting Wang, who had not been tortured had been \"turned\", Dai ordered him assassinated and a ''Juntong'' agent shot him in the shoulder during a failed attempt to kill him.<ref name=Wen-hsinYehp554/>\n\nThe No. 76 organization blew up the headquarters of the ''Juntong'' in Shanghai while the ''Juntong'' assassins killed a dozen of No. 76 organization leaders in the fall of 1939.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p555>Wen-hsin Yeh \"Dai Li and the Liu Geqing Affair: Heroism in the Chinese Secret Service During the War of Resistance\" pages 545\u2013562 from ''The Journal of Asian Studies'', Volume 48, Issue #3 August 1989 page 555.</ref> Wang's defection to the No. 76 organization proved a most serious blow as he betrayed all of the agents under his command, and the ''Kempeitai'' arrested dozens of ''Juntong agents'' in Shanghai, Beijing, and Tianjin due to the information provided by Wang.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p556/> On 15 November 1939, Zhao Gangyi, the ''Juntong'' chief in Qingdao, fearing it was only a matter of time before the ''Kempeitai'' arrested him owing to the information provided by Wang, decided to save himself and defected over to the Wang regime,  betraying all of the agents under his command to the ''Kempeitai''.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p556/> On 24 November 1939, thanks to information provided by Zhao, the ''Kempeitai'' raided the ''Juntong'''s headquarters in Beijing.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p556/>\n\nOn 21 December 1939, Ding was almost killed when his mistress, the teenage schoolgirl Zheng Pingru, led him into a ''Juntong'' assassination attempt.<ref name=WFp194>Wakeman, Frederic ''The Shanghai Badlands: Wartime Terrorism and Urban Crime, 1937-1941'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2002 page 194.</ref> When Ding ordered his men to execute Zheng, a girl born to a Chinese father and a Japanese mother, she asked them not to shoot her in the face, so she would still be beautiful at her funeral, a request that No. 76 execution squad honored.<ref name=WFp194/> This incident is generally believed to have been the inspiration for the 1979 novella [[Lust, Caution (novella)|''Lust, Caution'']] by [[Eileen Chang]], which in turn inspired the 2007 film ''[[Lust, Caution]]''. On Christmas Eve 1939, Chen Mingchu, a former ''Juntong'' agent who had joined the No. 76 organization was assassinated by the ''Juntong'' agents at the Huierdeng nightclub in Shanghai.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p555/> Chen and his twenty bodyguards were celebrating Christmas on the floor of the nightclub when a group of ''Juntong'' agents armed with machine-guns burst in to gun down Chen and his bodyguards.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p555/> On 8 September 1940, Zhou Guangshi, the chief of ''Juntong'' operations in occupied China was captured by the ''Kempeital'' who tortured and executed him.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p556/> By late 1941, most of the ''Juntong'' agents operating in the major cities occupied by Japan were either killed or captured.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p556/>\n\nVarious \"guerrilla command\" and \"traffic police\" groups under the NBIS carried out a wide range of covert espionage and counterintelligence activities against the Japanese and Japanese collaborators. In 1942, the [[Sino-American Cooperative Organization]] was founded, which led to 3, 000 Americans being sent to China for joint operations with the ''Juntong''.<ref>Pomar, Norman & Allen, Thomas ''The Spy Book'', New York: Random House, 1997 page 111.</ref> Dai's relations with the [[Office of Strategic Services]] (OSS) were unfriendly and at one point Dai warned William \"Wild Bill\" Donovan, the chief of the OSS: \"If the OSS tries to operate outside of SACO, I will kill your agents\".<ref>Pomar, Norman & Allen, Thomas ''The Spy Book'', New York: Random House, 1997 pages 111-112.</ref> The ''Juntong'' co-operated with the OSS in parachuting agents, mostly Chinese-Americans, behind Japanese lines, but relations were stained in 1943 when the OSS sent [[Ilya Andreyevich Tolstoy]] to [[Tibet (1912\u20131951)|Tibet]] to contact the [[Dalai Lama]] as China's government did not recognize Tibet's ''de facto'' independence.<ref name=PNATp112>Pomar, Norman & Allen, Thomas ''The Spy Book'', New York: Random House, 1997 page 112.</ref> China which regarded Tibet, which had become ''de facto'' independent in 1911, as a breakaway province that was still legally part of China, greatly resented the Tolstoy mission as a tacit American recognition of Tibetan independence.<ref name=PNATp112/> From 1937-41, more than 18,000 NBIS intelligence agents lost their lives, and by the end of the war the number has increased to more than 45,000.\n\n=== Chinese Civil War period ===\nIn August 1946, the [[Ministry of National Defense (Republic of China)|Ministry of National Defense]]  was established to replace the Military Commission, and the NBIS changed its name to the Counterintelligence Bureau under the Ministry of National Defense ({{zh|c=\u570b\u9632\u90e8\u4fdd\u5bc6\u5c40}}). [[Mao Renfeng]] was the director given the de facto responsibility for running the unit.\n\n=== After 1949 in mainland China ===\nAfter Nationalist government was moved to Taiwan in 1949, a number of BIS staff remained in mainland China for intelligence activities. The NBIS operatives were severely repressed by Chinese Communist government during the [[Campaign to Suppress Counterrevolutionaries]], and were mostly executed by firing squad or received heavy punishment.

It was devoted to intelligence gathering and covert [[Espionage|spying]] operation for purposes of national security and defense. It was originally headed by [[Dai Li]], and after 1946 he was succeeded by [[Mao Renfeng]]. This bureau was largely superseded by the '''Military Intelligence Bureau''' under [[Ministry of National Defense (Republic of China)|Ministry of National Defense]] in [[Taiwan]] today.\n\nThe NBIS had a great influence amongst the [[Nationalist Government]]'s military, police, administration, and transportation agencies, as well as embassies and consulates abroad during the [[Political Tutelage]] period (1928-1946) of [[Republic of China (1912\u201349)|Republic of China]]. It was often criticized by the political dissidents as a \"secret police\" involving in covert and espionage operation, including surveillance, kidnapping, assassinations, elimination and house-arrest against Chinese communists, Japanese spies as well as political dissidents.\n \nDuring the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Sino-Japanese War]], the NBIS was involved in a number of counter-intelligence and covert espionage warfare against the Japanese invaders. There were NBIS agents who defected to Japanese, and many of the secret police in [[Wang Jingwei]]'s Japanese-occupied areas were former NBIS agents.\n\nFrom a historical perspective, NBIS played an important role in [[Second Sino-Japanese War]]. Under the leadership of [[Dai Li]], the [[Nationalist Government]] had a body of 100,000 active spies involving in espionage warfare against Japanese, as well as against the [[Wang Jingwei]]-led puppet Nationalist Government of the Japanese-occupied areas.\n\n== History ==\n=== Early stages ===\nThe NBIS was founded in 1927 as the \"Military Commission of Clandestine Investigation Section of the [[National Revolutionary Army]]\" ({{zh|c=\u570b\u6c11\u9769\u547d\u8ecd\u7e3d\u53f8\u4ee4\u90e8\u5bc6\u67e5\u7d44}})  with the \"Special Works Department\"({{zh|c=\u570b\u6c11\u653f\u5e9c\u8ecd\u4e8b\u59d4\u54e1\u6703\u7279\u52d9\u8655}}) set up in 1932. When the \"Investigation and Statistics Bureau\" was established under the Military Commission, the \"Special Works Department\" was incorporated into the Bureau and renamed the \"Second Division\", and is responsible for intelligence collection and personnel training. All of the bureau's affairs were under the direct command of [[Chiang Kai-shek]]. Dai sought to make the ''Juntong'' into an extended family with himself as the stern paternal figure, stressing traditional Chinese Confucian values of filial piety, loyalty, benevolence, and righteousness.<ref>Wen-hsin Yeh \"Dai Li and the Liu Geqing Affair: Heroism in the Chinese Secret Service During the War of Resistance\" pages 545-562 from ''The Journal of Asian Studies'', Volume 48, Issue #3 August 1989 pages 546-547</ref> The ''Juntong'' operated as a traditional sworn brotherhood with all of the senior officers taking an oath making themselves into \"brothers\".<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p547>Wen-hsin Yeh \"Dai Li and the Liu Geqing Affair: Heroism in the Chinese Secret Service During the War of Resistance\" pages 545-562 from ''The Journal of Asian Studies'', Volume 48, Issue #3 August 1989 page 547</ref> The inspiration for the ''Juntong'' were the secret sworn brotherhoods portrayed in the classics of Chinese literature like ''Water Margin'' and ''The Romance of the Three Kingdoms''.<ref>Wen-hsin Yeh \"Dai Li and the Liu Geqing Affair: Heroism in the Chinese Secret Service During the War of Resistance\" pages 545-562 from ''The Journal of Asian Studies'', Volume 48, Issue #3 August 1989 page 546</ref> Dai presented himself as a stern Confucian father figure to the men and women of the ''Juntong'' and liked to quote from book ''The Dynastic History of the Han'' is \"Is personal happiness possible before the extermination of the Xiongnu?\"<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p547/> Reflecting this mentality, the men and women serving in the ''Juntong'' were forbidden to marry and expected to be celibate as their only love was to be China.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p547/> The rules about celibacy were not always followed as Liu Gequing, the ''Juntong'' ace assassin fell in love with and had a relationship with a fellow agent, Lu Ti, during his time in Shanghai.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p556>Wen-hsin Yeh \"Dai Li and the Liu Geqing Affair: Heroism in the Chinese Secret Service During the War of Resistance\" pages 545\u2013562 from ''The Journal of Asian Studies'', Volume 48, Issue #3 August 1989 page 556.</ref> Likewise, ''Juntong'' agents were expected to forsake smoking, gambling and playing mahjong as Dai wanted them to hard work and dedicate their lives totally to China.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p547/> Reflecting this ethos of absolute dedication to the cause, many of the assassination missions that ''Juntong'' agents were sent on against the Chinese Communists and later on during the war with Japan were known to be suicide missions as the expectation was that ''Juntong'' agents were to value China more than their own lives.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p548>Wen-hsin Yeh \"Dai Li and the Liu Geqing Affair: Heroism in the Chinese Secret Service During the War of Resistance\" pages 545-562 from ''The Journal of Asian Studies'', Volume 48, Issue #3 August 1989 page 548</ref> Dai often said that the ''Juntong'' were to serve Chiang \"like dogs and horses serving their masters without a mind of their own\" as Dai presented Chiang as \"the Leader\" to whom all Chinese had to obey unconditionally.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p548/> As the world of espionage was a secretive one, ''Juntong'' agents were advised that they were to be \"anonymous heroes\" whose deeds would not be remembered by historians.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p549>Wen-hsin Yeh \"Dai Li and the Liu Geqing Affair: Heroism in the Chinese Secret Service During the War of Resistance\" pages 545-562 from ''The Journal of Asian Studies'', Volume 48, Issue #3 August 1989 page 549</ref>\n\n''Juntong'' agents tended to come from the provincial schools as Dai disliked recruiting those who attended universities, whom the xenophobic, ultra-conservative Dai felt were too exposed to Western influence to fit into the ''Juntong''.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p549/> ''Juntong'' agents, especially those working as assassins were generally expected to know martial arts before joining, both to improve their skills at killing and because Dai felt the sort of self-discipline needed to master the martial arts was the same sort of dedication that he expected in his agents.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p549/> Reflecting Dai's traditionalism, the model for the ''Juntong'' were the assassins of the Warring States period and those portrayed in ''The Romance of the Three Kingdoms''.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p549/> One of the most best loved books among the ''Juntong'' was the novel ''Jianghu qixia zhuan'' (''Legendary Roving Knights of the Rivers and Lakes''), a ''[[wuxia]]'' (martial arts) book that was very popular in Republican China.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p549/> Dai liked the book so much that he recruited the ''kung fu'' master who was said to be the inspiration for the hero of ''Jianghu qixia zhuan'' into the ''Juntong''.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p549/> The men and women of the ''Juntong'' liked to see themselves as \"knights\" who would use their skills to defend the weak from the strong and save China from its enemies.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p549/> A disproportionate number of the men and women of the ''Juntong'' came from the provinces of Hunan, Guangdong, and Zhejiang, all places where Western influence was limited and traditional values flourished.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p549/>\n\nIn 1938, the Special Works Department was expanded and took over the \"Investigation and Statistics Bureau\" to cope with the increasingly demanding tasks of intelligence operations. [[Dai Li]] was assigned as the ''de facto'' responsibility for running the unit.  Dai's preference for recruiting on the basis of familial loyalties, where one sibling would recruit other siblings to the ''Juntong'' proved to be a weakness, when in 1938 a number of ''Juntong'' agents defected over to work for the \"reformed\" government of [[Wang Jingwei]], pitting brother literally against brother.<ref>Wen-hsin Yeh \"Dai Li and the Liu Geqing Affair: Heroism in the Chinese Secret Service During the War of Resistance\" pages 545-562 from ''The Journal of Asian Studies'', Volume 48, Issue #3 August 1989 pages 549-550</ref>\n\n=== Sino-Japanese War period ===\nDuring the Sino-Japanese War, NBIS had orchestrated the assassinations of several key Japanese enemy military and government personnel. Between 1937-41, the ''Juntong'', working together with the Green Gang triad, carried out 150 assassinations of Chinese collaborators and 40 Japanese officers in Shanghai alone.<ref name=FJp356>Fenby, Jonathan ''Chiang Kai-Shek China's Generalissimo and the Nation He Lost'', New York : Carrol & Graf, 2004 page 356.</ref><ref name=Wen-hsinYehp552>Wen-hsin Yeh \"Dai Li and the Liu Geqing Affair: Heroism in the Chinese Secret Service During the War of Resistance\" pages 545\u2013562 from ''The Journal of Asian Studies'', Volume 48, Issue #3 August 1989 page 552.</ref> The ''Juntong'' favored assassinating Chinese collaborators over the Japanese partly because they were easier to kill as the Japanese tended to stick to certain enclaves, but mostly to prevent the Japanese from imposing any sort of ordered government in parts of China they had occupied.<ref name=Wen-hsinYehp551>Wen-hsin Yeh \"Dai Li and the Liu Geqing Affair: Heroism in the Chinese Secret Service During the War of Resistance\" pages 545\u2013562 from ''The Journal of Asian Studies'', Volume 48, Issue #3 August 1989 page 551.</ref> Japan had occupied vast sections of China inhabited by millions of people requiring hundreds of thousands of civil servants to administer while the number of Japanese who were fluent in Mandarin or Cantonese was limited, and to a very large extent the Japanese depended upon Chinese collaborators to administer China for them.<ref name=Wen-hsinYehp551/> Zhang Xiaolin, a leading member of the Green Gang who went over to the Japanese in 1937 was gunned down by a ''Juntong'' assassin.<ref name=FJp356/> In October 1938, [[Tang Shaoyi]], a former prime minister of the Republic of China who had agreed to serve the Japanese was killed at his home when a ''Juntong'' assassin posing as an antique dealer used the antique axe he was showing to Tang to smash in his head.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p550>Wen-hsin Yeh \"Dai Li and the Liu Geqing Affair: Heroism in the Chinese Secret Service During the War of Resistance\" pages 545-562 from ''The Journal of Asian Studies'', Volume 48, Issue #3 August 1989 page 550</ref> As the Japanese had no idea of who the ''Juntong'' assassins were, they restored to lashing out by executing at random innocent people who had nothing to do with the assassinations.<ref name=Wen-hsinYehp552/>\n\nOn Chinese New Year (18 February 1939), four ''Juntong'' agents assassinated Chen Lu, the foreign minister of the [[Wang Jingwei]] puppet government as he paying respects to his ancestors in his mansion in the French Concession of Shanghai.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p550/> Led by the ''Juntong'' ace assassin Liu Geqing, he and three others entered Chen's mansion as two of his bodyguards let them in, machine-gunned Chen down as he paying his respects before the family shrine, and then draped over his corpse a scroll reading \"Death to Collaborators! Long Live Generalissimo Chiang Kai-Shek!\".<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p550/> Fu Xiaoan, the banker and shipping tycoon who had long been an enemy of the Kuomintang and had thrown in his lot with the Japanese, becoming the collaborating mayor of Shanghai, was hacked to death with a meat chopper in his bed by his cook who was secretly a ''Juntong'' assassin.<ref name=FJp356/> In 1939, a banquet to celebrate the friendship between Japan and the [[Wang Jingwei]] regime attended by senior Japanese officers and Chinese collaborators in Shanghai were ruined when the cooks, many of whom were working for the ''Juntong'' poisoned the food, and only prompt medical attention that required pumping the stomachs of the guests prevented hundreds of deaths.<ref name=FJp357>Fenby, Jonathan ''Chiang Kai-Shek China's Generalissimo and the Nation He Lost'', New York : Carrol & Graf, 2004 page 357.</ref> Later in 1939, a train that carrying various Japanese officers and officials of the Wang Jingwei regime from Shanghai to Nanking for a ceremony marking a new treaty that was meant to cement Wang's regime in its place in the \"New Order in Asia\" was blown up by ''Juntong'' agents, killing 74 and wounding hundreds more.<ref name=FJp357/>\n\nThe chief enemy of the ''Juntong'' in Shanghai were not the Japanese, most of whom did not speak Mandarin and even those who did speak Mandarin did so with a Japanese accent that betrayed where they were from, but rather the secret service loyal to the Wang regime that was based in the Huxi \"badlands\" district in Shanghai headed by [[Ding Mocun]] and Li Shiqun, two former Communists  who defected over to the ''Juntong'' before going over to the Japanese.<ref name=FJp357/><ref name=Wen-hsinYehp552/> The No. 76 organization as it was known after its address at 76 Jessfield Road was founded in February 1939 when Ding and Li presented themselves to General [[Kenji Doihara]], the chief of Japanese intelligence in China, at a restaurant in Shanghai's \"Little Tokyo\" district, and proclaimed their willingness to serve Japan, stating as former ''Juntong'' agents that they were the only men who could beat the ''Juntong'' at its own game.<ref name=Wen-hsinYehp552/> On 1 March 1939, the No. 76 organization came into being, and its liaison officer was Colonel Haruke Yoshitane of the Plum Blossom Agency, who in turn reported to Colonel Kagesa Sadaaki of the ''[[Kempeitai]]'', the much feared Japanese military police.<ref name=Wen-hsinYehp552/> On 8 May 1939, Wu Shibao, a Green Gang member and the leader of \"a gang of local thugs and bullies\" agreed to become Li's bodyguard and to provide the \"muscle\" for the No. 76 organization.<ref name=Wen-hsinYehp553>Wen-hsin Yeh \"Dai Li and the Liu Geqing Affair: Heroism in the Chinese Secret Service During the War of Resistance\" pages 545-562 from ''The Journal of Asian Studies'', Volume 48, Issue #3 August 1989 page 553</ref> Li boosted in a speech \"With the left hand we'll annihilate the Blue Shirts, with the right we'll knock down the C.C Clique!\".<ref name=Wen-hsinYehp553/> The No. 76 organization, which moved into its base at No. 76 Jessfield Road in July 1939, was based in a mansion that had once belonged to the warlord General Chen Diaoyuan that was turned into a fortress with concrete blocks on the drive-way and electrified iron gates as both Ding and Li had an obsessive fear of assassination.<ref name=Wen-hsinYehp552/>\n\nAs both Ding and Li had been senior ''Juntong'' agents until 1938 with Ding heading the Third Section of the Military Affairs Bureau until late 1938 while Li had been a member of the Green Gang, the two men knew the ''Juntong'' very well and in many ways the No. 76 organization was a mirror image of the ''Juntong''.<ref name=Wen-hsinYehp553/> The collaborating secret police assassinated anti-Japanese Chinese;

The NBIS operatives were severely repressed by Chinese Communist government during the [[Campaign to Suppress Counterrevolutionaries]], and were mostly executed by firing squad or received heavy punishment. By end of the 1950s, the NBIS staff were largely shot or serving hard labor on the mainland.\n\n=== In Taiwan ===\nIn 1955, the Bureau was again reorganized as the Intelligence Bureau ({{zh|c=\u570b\u9632\u90e8\u60c5\u5831\u5c40}}), responsible for early-warning intelligence collection and strategic analysis. Since then, the [[Ministry of Justice]] took over the functions of counterintelligence and investigation from the Bureau.\n\nOn 1 July 1985, the '''Military Intelligence Bureau''' ({{zh|c=\u570b\u9632\u90e8\u8ecd\u4e8b\u60c5\u5831\u5c40}}) was created by merging the Special Military Intelligence Office with the Intelligence Bureau. The Military Intelligence Bureau was subordinated to the  [[Ministry of National Defense (Republic of China)|Ministry of National Defense]] under the direct command of the Chief of the [[Staff (military)|General Staff]].\n\n== See also ==\n* [[National Security Bureau (Republic of China)|National Security Bureau]]\n* [http://www.mnd.gov.tw/English/Publish.aspx?cnid=418&p=264 Military Intelligence Bureau]\n*{{Interlanguage link|1=Bureau of Military Intelligence|2=zh|3=\u570b\u9632\u90e8\u8ecd\u4e8b\u60c5\u5831\u5c40|lt=Military Intelligence Bureau|WD=Q14319999}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{National Intelligence Agencies}}\n{{Military_of_the_Republic_of_China}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Investigation and Statistics Bureau, The}}\n[[Category:Intelligence agencies]]\n[[Category:Government of the Republic of China]]\n[[Category:1927 establishments in China]]\n[[Category:Taiwanese intelligence agencies]]\n", "name_user": "Anas1712", "label": "safe", "comment": "intermediair sauvegard modification - putting footnotes for some references", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureau_of_Investigation_and_Statistics"}

The regiment served as [[mounted infantry]] from March 17, 1863, to November 1, 1864, notably as part of the [[Lightning Brigade (US Army of the Cumberland 1863)|Lightning Brigade]] during the [[Tullahoma campaign|Tullahoma]] and [[Chickamauga campaign|Chickamauga]] Campaigns.\n\n==Initial Infantry Service==\nThe 72nd Indiana Infantry was organized at [[Lafayette, Indiana|Lafayette]], [[Indiana]] and mustered in for a three-year enlistment at [[Indianapolis]], Indiana, on August 16, 1862, under the command of [[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] Abram O. Miller.\n\n==Conversion to Mounted Infantry ==\n\nIn December 1862, the regiment received a new brigade commander, Colonel [[John T. Wilder]]. After frustrating chases on foot after mounted rebel cavalry raiders, the brigade was converted to mounted infantry. At the same time, Wilder proposed to the regiments in the brigade the private purchase of repeating rifles. The 72nd voted to go ahead with the conversion to mounted infantry and the purchase of the rifles.

The brigade distinguished itself with its performance at [[Battle of Chickamauga|Chickamauga]]. During the battle, it maintained integrity and discipline exacting high casualties on its attackers. After the battle, it retreated with the army to Chattanooga where it was besieged. \n\nThe performance of the brigade had demonstrated the value of mounted infantry, and Wilder and the regiments were commended. During the reorganization after Grant took command in the city, the brigade was broken up and the regiments were transferred to the Cavalry Corps.

After stopping in [[Rothville, Missouri]], they settled in the [[Indian country]] of [[Kansas]], near modern day [[Independence, Kansas#History|Independence, Kansas]]. Her younger sister, [[Carrie Ingalls|Carrie]], was born in Independence in August 1870, not long before they moved again. According to Ingalls Wilder, her father Charles Ingalls had been told that the location would be open to white settlers, but when they arrived this was not the case. The Ingalls family had no legal right to occupy their homestead because it was on the [[Osage Nation|Osage Indian]] reservation. They had just begun to farm when they heard rumors that settlers would be evicted, so they left in the spring of 1871. Although in her novel, ''[[Little House on the Prairie (novel)|Little House on the Prairie]],'' and ''Pioneer Girl'' memoir, Ingalls Wilder portrayed their departure as being prompted by rumors of eviction, she also noted that her parents needed to recover their Wisconsin land because the buyer had not paid the mortgage.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Kaye |first=Frances W. |title=Little Squatter on the Osage Diminished Reserve: Reading Laura Ingalls Wilder's Kansas Indians |journal=Great Plains Quarterly |volume=20 |issue=2 |year=2000 |pages=123\u2013140 |doi= |url=http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1022&context=greatplainsquarterly }}</ref>\n\nThe Ingalls family went back to Wisconsin where they lived for the next three years.

In Walnut Grove, the family first lived in a dugout sod house on a [[Preemption (land)|preemption]] claim; after wintering in it, they moved into a new house built on the same land. Two summers of ruined crops led them to move to [[Iowa]]. On the way, they stayed again with Charles Ingalls' brother, Peter Ingalls, this time on his farm near [[South Troy, Minnesota]]. Her brother, Charles Frederick Ingalls (\"Freddie\"), was born there on November 1, 1875, dying nine months later in August 1876. In [[Burr Oak, Iowa]], the family helped run a hotel. The youngest of the Ingalls children, [[Grace Ingalls|Grace]], was born there on May 23, 1877.\n\nThe family moved from Burr Oak back to Walnut Grove where Charles Ingalls served as the town butcher and [[justice of the peace]]. He accepted a railroad job in the spring of 1879, which took him to eastern [[Dakota Territory]], where they joined him that fall. Ingalls Wilder omitted the period in 1876\u20131877 when they lived near Burr Oak, skipping to Dakota Territory, portrayed in ''[[By the Shores of Silver Lake]]'' (1939).\n\n===De Smet===\n[[File:Laura ingalls wilder museum surveyor's house desmet sd.jpg|thumb|right|Surveyor's House, the first home in Dakota Territory of the Charles Ingalls family - De Smet, South Dakota]]\nWilder's father filed for a [[Homestead Act|formal homestead]] over the winter of 1879\u20131880.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/research/land/ingalls|title=Land Records: Ingalls Homestead File|date=August 15, 2016|website=National Archives|access-date=13 June 2019}}</ref> [[De Smet, South Dakota]], became her parents' and sister Mary's home for the remainder of their lives. After spending the mild winter of 1879\u20131880 in the surveyor's house, they watched the town of De Smet rise up from the prairie in 1880. The following winter, 1880\u20131881, one of the most severe on record in the Dakotas, was later described by Ingalls Wilder in her novel, ''[[The Long Winter (novel)|The Long Winter]]'' (1940). Once the family was settled in De Smet, Ingalls attended school, worked several part-time jobs, and made friends. Among them was bachelor homesteader [[Almanzo Wilder]].

Complications from a life-threatening bout of [[diphtheria]] left Almanzo partially [[paralysis|paralyzed]]. Although he eventually regained nearly full use of his legs, he needed a cane to walk for the remainder of his life. This setback, among many others, began a series of unfortunate events that included the death of their newborn son, the destruction of their barn along with its hay and grain by a mysterious fire,<ref>Miller 1998, p. 80.</ref> the total loss of their home from a fire accidentally set by Rose,<ref>Miller 1998, p. 84.</ref> and several years of severe [[drought]] that left them in debt, physically ill, and unable to earn a living from their 320 acres (129.5 hectares) of prairie land. These trials were documented in Wilder's book ''[[The First Four Years (novel)|The First Four Years]]'' (published in 1971). Around 1890, they left De Smet and spent about a year resting at the home of Almanzo's parents on their [[Spring Valley, Minnesota]], farm before moving briefly to [[Westville, Florida]], in search of a climate to improve Almanzo's health. They found, however, that the dry plains they were used to were very different from the humidity they encountered in Westville. The weather, along with feeling out of place among the locals, encouraged their return to De Smet in 1892, where they purchased a small home.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.minnpost.com/mnopedia/2014/08/story-behind-stories-laura-ingalls-wilders-life-minnesota-and-beyond/|title=The story behind the stories: Laura Ingalls Wilder\u2019s life in Minnesota and beyond|date=2014-08-19|website=MinnPost|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-04}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2018/04/19/laura-ingalls-wilder-and-wilder/|title=Wilder and Wilder|last=Messud|first=Claire|date=2018-04-19|access-date=2020-02-04|language=en|issn=0028-7504}}</ref>\n\n==Move to Mansfield, Missouri==\n[[File:LauraIngallsWilder-RockyRidgeFarm-MansfieldMO adjusted.jpg|thumb|right|Rocky Ridge Farm, Mansfield, Missouri]]\n\nIn 1894, the Wilders moved to [[Mansfield, Missouri]], and used their savings to make the [[down payment]] on an undeveloped property just outside town.

At first, they earned income only from wagon loads of fire wood they would sell in town for 50 cents.  Financial security came slowly. Apple trees they planted did not bear fruit for seven years. Almanzo's parents visited around that time and gave them the deed to the house they had been renting in Mansfield, which was the economic boost Wilder's family needed. They then added to the property outside town, and eventually accrued nearly 200 acres (80.9 hectares). Around 1910, they sold the house in town, moved back to the farm, and completed the farmhouse with the proceeds. What began as about 40 acres (16.2 hectares) of thickly wooded, stone-covered hillside with a windowless log cabin became in 20 years a relatively prosperous poultry, dairy, and fruit farm, and a 10-room farmhouse.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=kWsrAQAAQBAJ&lpg=PA69&ots=VWlFJOd3i1&dq=laura%20ingalls%20wilder%20missouri%2010%20room%20farmhouse&pg=PA69#v=onepage&q=laura%20ingalls%20wilder%20missouri%2010%20room%20farmhouse&f=false|title=Famous Americans: A Directory of Museums, Historic Sites, and Memorials|last=Danilov|first=Victor J.|date=2013-09-26|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0-8108-9186-9|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe Wilders had learned from cultivating wheat as their sole crop in De Smet. They diversified Rocky Ridge Farm with poultry, a dairy farm, and a large apple orchard. Wilder became active in various clubs and was an advocate for several regional farm associations. She was recognized as an authority in poultry farming and rural living, which led to invitations to speak to groups around the region.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Laura Ingalls Wilder, farm journalist : writings from the Ozarks|last=Wilder |first=Laura Ingalls |date=2007 |publisher=University of Missouri Press |editor-last=Hines |editor-first=Stephen W. |isbn=978-0826266156 |location=Columbia |oclc=427509646}}</ref>\n\n==Writing career==\nAn invitation to submit an article to the ''Missouri Ruralist'' in 1911 led to Wilder's permanent position as a columnist and editor with that publication, which she held until the mid-1920s. She also took a paid position with the local [[Federal Farm Loan Act|Farm Loan Association]], dispensing small loans to local farmers.\n\nWilder's column in the ''Ruralist'', \"As a Farm Woman Thinks\", introduced her to a loyal audience of rural [[Ozarks|Ozarkians]], who enjoyed her regular columns. Her topics ranged from home and family, including her 1915 trip to [[San Francisco, California]], to visit Rose Lane and the Pan-Pacific exhibition, to [[World War I]] and other world events, and to the fascinating world travels of Lane as well as her own thoughts on the increasing options offered to women during this era. While the couple were never wealthy until the \"Little House\" books began to achieve popularity, the farming operation and Wilder's income from writing and the Farm Loan Association provided them with a stable living.\n\n\"[By] 1924\", according to the Professor John E. Miller, \"[a]fter more than a decade of writing for farm papers, Wilder had become a disciplined writer, able to produce thoughtful, readable prose for a general audience.\" At this time, her now-married daughter, Rose Wilder Lane, helped her publish two articles describing the interior of the farmhouse, in ''Country Gentleman'' magazine.<ref>Miller 1998, p. 161.</ref>\n\nIt was also around this time that Lane began intensively encouraging Wilder to improve her writing skills with a view toward greater success as a writer than Lane had already achieved.<ref>Miller 1998, p. 162.</ref>  The Wilders, according to Miller, had come to \"[depend] on annual income subsidies from their increasingly famous and successful daughter.\" They both had concluded that the solution for improving their retirement income was for Wilder to become a successful writer herself. However, the \"project never proceeded very far.\"<ref>Miller 2008, p. 24.</ref>\n\nIn 1928, Lane hired out the construction of an English-style stone cottage for her parents on property adjacent to the farmhouse they had personally built and still inhabited. She remodeled and took it over.<ref name=Miller1998-177>Miller 1998, p. 177.</ref>\n\n===''Little House'' books===\n{{main|List of Little House on the Prairie books}}\n\nThe [[Wall Street Crash of 1929|Stock Market Crash of 1929]] wiped the Wilders out; Lane's investments were devastated as well. They still owned the 200-acre (81-hectare) farm, but they had invested most of their savings with Lane's broker. In 1930, Wilder requested Lane's opinion about an autobiographical manuscript she had written about her pioneering childhood. The [[Great Depression]], coupled with the deaths of Wilder's mother in 1924 and her older sister in 1928, seem to have prompted her to preserve her memories in a life story called ''Pioneer Girl''. She also hoped that her writing would generate some additional income. The original title of the first of the books was ''When Grandma Was a Little Girl''.<ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=Students visiting Wilder's prairie|last=Hines-Dochterman|first=Meredith|date=30 September 2005|work=St. Joseph News-Press|access-date=}}</ref> On the advice of Lane's publisher, she greatly expanded the story. As a result of Lane's publishing connections as a successful writer and after editing by her, [[Harper (publisher)#Harper & Brothers (1833\u20131962)|Harper & Brothers]] published Wilder's book in 1932 as ''Little House in the Big Woods''. After its success, she continued writing. The close and often rocky collaboration between her and Lane continued, in person until 1935, when Lane permanently left Rocky Ridge Farm, and afterward by correspondence.\n\nThe collaboration worked both ways: two of Lane's most successful novels, ''Let the Hurricane Roar'' (1932) and ''Free Land'' (1938), were written at the same time as the \"Little House\" series and basically retold Ingalls and Wilder family tales in an adult format.<ref name=Miller2008-40>Miller 2008, p. 40.</ref>\n\n====Authorship controversy====\nSome, including Lane's biographer, William Holtz, have alleged that Wilder's daughter was her ghostwriter.<ref>Holtz 1993.{{full citation needed|date=October 2015}}<!-- page needed --></ref>  Existing evidence includes ongoing correspondence between the women about the books' development, Lane's extensive diaries, and Wilder's handwritten manuscripts with edit notations shows an ongoing collaboration between the two women.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\nMiller, using this record, describes varying levels of involvement by Lane. ''[[Little House in the Big Woods]]'' (1932) and ''[[These Happy Golden Years]]'' (1943), he notes, received the least editing. \"The first pages&nbsp;... and other large sections of [''Big Woods'']\", he observes, \"stand largely intact, indicating&nbsp;... from the start&nbsp;...[Laura's] talent for narrative description.\"<ref>Miller 1998, pp. 6, 190.</ref>  Some volumes saw heavier participation by Lane,<ref>Miller 2008, pp. 37 et seq.</ref> while [[The First Four Years (novel)|''The First Four Years'']] (1971) appears to be exclusively a Wilder work.<ref name=thurman2009>{{cite web |author=Thurman, Judith |url=http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/atlarge/2009/08/10/090810crat_atlarge_thurman?currentPage=paragraph-29 |title=Wilder Women: The mother and daughter behind the Little House stories |date=August 10, 2009 |work=The New Yorker |accessdate=February 8, 2015 }}</ref>\nConcludes Miller, \"In the end, the lasting literary legacy remains that of the mother more than that of the daughter&nbsp;... Lane possessed style; Wilder had substance.\"<ref name=Miller2008-40/>\n\nThe controversy over authorship is often tied to the movement to read the Little House series through an ideological lens. Lane emerged in the 1930s as an avowed conservative polemicist and critic of the [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] administration and his [[New Deal]] programs.

''The First Four Years'', about the early days of the Wilder marriage, was discovered by her literary executor [[Roger MacBride]] after Lane's 1968 death and published in 1971, unedited by Lane or MacBride. It is now marketed as the ninth volume.<ref name=thurman2009/>\n\nSince the publication of ''Little House in the Big Woods'' (1932), the books have been continuously in print and have been translated into 40 other languages. Wilder's first\u2014and smallest\u2014royalty check from Harper, in 1932, was for $500, {{Inflation|US|500|1932|r=-1|fmt=eq}}. By the mid-1930s the royalties from the ''Little House'' books brought a steady and increasingly substantial income to the Wilders for the first time in their 50 years of marriage. The collaboration also brought the two writers at Rocky Ridge Farm the money they needed to recoup the loss of their investments in the stock market. Various honors, huge amounts of fan mail, and other accolades were bestowed on Wilder.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\n===Autobiography: ''Pioneer Girl''===\nIn 1929\u20131930, already in her early 60s, Wilder began writing her autobiography, titled ''Pioneer Girl.'' It was rejected by publishers. At Lane's urging, she rewrote most of her stories for children. The result was the ''Little House'' series of books. In 2014, the [[South Dakota State Historical Society]] published an annotated version of Wilder's autobiography, titled ''Pioneer Girl: The Annotated Autobiography''.<ref name=SDHS>[http://pioneergirlproject.org/2014/11/21/pioneer-girl-is-out \"Pioneer Girl is out!\"].

Most of the surrounding area (including the property with the stone cottage Lane had built for them) was sold, but they still kept some farm animals, and tended their flower beds and vegetable gardens. Almost daily, carloads of fans stopped by, eager to meet the \"Laura\" of the ''Little House'' books.\n\nThe Wilders lived independently and without financial worries until Almanzo's death at the farm in 1949 at age 92. Wilder remained on the farm. For the next eight years, she lived alone, looked after by a circle of neighbors and friends.

Following her demise in 1968, her heir, [[Roger MacBride]], gained control of the books' copyrights. He was like an informally adopted son or grandson to her (one of several younger men with whom she had such a relationship),<ref>See Carolyn Fraser, ''Prairie Fires: The American Dreams of Laura Ingalls Wilder.''

All of his actions before Lane's death carried her apparent approval; at her request, the copyrights to each of Wilder's \"Little House\" books, as well as those of Lane's own literary works, had been renewed in his name when the original copyrights expired, during the decade between Wilder's and Lane's deaths.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/11/23/arts/little-library-on-the-offensive.html|title=Little Library On the Offensive|last=Richardson|first=Lynda|date=1999-11-23|work=The New York Times|access-date=2020-02-04|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> Nonetheless, many scholars and other readers consider his means of gaining control of the literary estate to have been shady at best, as well as going against Wilder's wishes.

After stopping in [[Rothville, Missouri]], they settled in the [[Indian country]] of [[Kansas]], near modern day [[Independence, Kansas#History|Independence, Kansas]]. Her younger sister, [[Carrie Ingalls|Carrie]], was born in Independence in August 1870, not long before they moved again. According to Ingalls Wilder, her father Charles Ingalls had been told that the location would be open to white settlers, but when they arrived this was not the case. The Ingalls family had no legal right to occupy their homestead because it was on the [[Osage Nation|Osage Indian]] reservation. They had just begun to farm when they heard rumors that settlers would be evicted, so they left in the spring of 1871. Although in her novel, ''[[Little House on the Prairie (novel)|Little House on the Prairie]],'' and ''Pioneer Girl'' memoir, Ingalls Wilder portrayed their departure as being prompted by rumors of eviction, she also noted that her parents needed to recover their Wisconsin land because the buyer had not paid the mortgage.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Kaye |first=Frances W. |title=Little Squatter on the Osage Diminished Reserve: Reading Laura Ingalls Wilder's Kansas Indians |journal=Great Plains Quarterly |volume=20 |issue=2 |year=2000 |pages=123\u2013140 |doi= |url=http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1022&context=greatplainsquarterly }}</ref>\n\nThe Ingalls family went back to Wisconsin where they lived for the next three years.

In Walnut Grove, the family first lived in a dugout sod house on a [[Preemption (land)|preemption]] claim; after wintering in it, they moved into a new house built on the same land. Two summers of ruined crops led them to move to [[Iowa]]. On the way, they stayed again with Charles Ingalls' brother, Peter Ingalls, this time on his farm near [[South Troy, Minnesota]]. Her brother, Charles Frederick Ingalls (\"Freddie\"), was born there on November 1, 1875, dying nine months later in August 1876. In [[Burr Oak, Iowa]], the family helped run a hotel. The youngest of the Ingalls children, [[Grace Ingalls|Grace]], was born there on May 23, 1877.\n\nThe family moved from Burr Oak back to Walnut Grove where Charles Ingalls served as the town butcher and [[justice of the peace]]. He accepted a railroad job in the spring of 1879, which took him to eastern [[Dakota Territory]], where they joined him that fall. Ingalls Wilder omitted the period in 1876\u20131877 when they lived near Burr Oak, skipping to Dakota Territory, portrayed in ''[[By the Shores of Silver Lake]]'' (1939).\n\n===De Smet===\n[[File:Laura ingalls wilder museum surveyor's house desmet sd.jpg|thumb|right|Surveyor's House, the first home in Dakota Territory of the Charles Ingalls family - De Smet, South Dakota]]\nWilder's father filed for a [[Homestead Act|formal homestead]] over the winter of 1879\u20131880.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/research/land/ingalls|title=Land Records: Ingalls Homestead File|date=August 15, 2016|website=National Archives|access-date=13 June 2019}}</ref> [[De Smet, South Dakota]], became her parents' and sister Mary's home for the remainder of their lives. After spending the mild winter of 1879\u20131880 in the surveyor's house, they watched the town of De Smet rise up from the prairie in 1880. The following winter, 1880\u20131881, one of the most severe on record in the Dakotas, was later described by Ingalls Wilder in her novel, ''[[The Long Winter (novel)|The Long Winter]]'' (1940). Once the family was settled in De Smet, Ingalls attended school, worked several part-time jobs, and made friends. Among them was bachelor homesteader [[Almanzo Wilder]]. This time in her life is documented in the books ''[[Little Town on the Prairie]]'' (1941) and ''[[These Happy Golden Years]]'' (1943).\n\n===Young teacher===\nOn December 10, 1882, two months before her 16th birthday, Ingalls accepted her first teaching position.<ref>{{cite web|title=Laura Ingalls Wilder Timeline|url=https://hoover.archives.gov/LIW/timeline/timeline.html|website=Herbert Hoover Presidential Library & Museum|publisher=Herbert Hoover Presidential Library & Museum|accessdate=January 27, 2017}}</ref> She taught three terms in [[one-room school]]s when she was not attending school in De Smet.

Complications from a life-threatening bout of [[diphtheria]] left Almanzo partially [[paralysis|paralyzed]]. Although he eventually regained nearly full use of his legs, he needed a cane to walk for the remainder of his life. This setback, among many others, began a series of unfortunate events that included the death of their newborn son, the destruction of their barn along with its hay and grain by a mysterious fire,<ref>Miller 1998, p. 80.</ref> the total loss of their home from a fire accidentally set by Rose,<ref>Miller 1998, p. 84.</ref> and several years of severe [[drought]] that left them in debt, physically ill, and unable to earn a living from their 320 acres (129.5 hectares) of prairie land. These trials were documented in Wilder's book ''[[The First Four Years (novel)|The First Four Years]]'' (published in 1971). Around 1890, they left De Smet and spent about a year resting at the home of Almanzo's parents on their [[Spring Valley, Minnesota]], farm before moving briefly to [[Westville, Florida]], in search of a climate to improve Almanzo's health.

At first, they earned income only from wagon loads of fire wood they would sell in town for 50 cents.  Financial security came slowly. Apple trees they planted did not bear fruit for seven years. Almanzo's parents visited around that time and gave them the deed to the house they had been renting in Mansfield, which was the economic boost Wilder's family needed. They then added to the property outside town, and eventually accrued nearly 200 acres (80.9 hectares). Around 1910, they sold the house in town, moved back to the farm, and completed the farmhouse with the proceeds. What began as about 40 acres (16.2 hectares) of thickly wooded, stone-covered hillside with a windowless log cabin became in 20 years a relatively prosperous poultry, dairy, and fruit farm, and a 10-room farmhouse.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=kWsrAQAAQBAJ&lpg=PA69&ots=VWlFJOd3i1&dq=laura%20ingalls%20wilder%20missouri%2010%20room%20farmhouse&pg=PA69#v=onepage&q=laura%20ingalls%20wilder%20missouri%2010%20room%20farmhouse&f=false|title=Famous Americans: A Directory of Museums, Historic Sites, and Memorials|last=Danilov|first=Victor J.|date=2013-09-26|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0-8108-9186-9|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe Wilders had learned from cultivating wheat as their sole crop in De Smet. They diversified Rocky Ridge Farm with poultry, a dairy farm, and a large apple orchard. Wilder became active in various clubs and was an advocate for several regional farm associations. She was recognized as an authority in poultry farming and rural living, which led to invitations to speak to groups around the region.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Laura Ingalls Wilder, farm journalist : writings from the Ozarks|last=Wilder |first=Laura Ingalls |date=2007 |publisher=University of Missouri Press |editor-last=Hines |editor-first=Stephen W. |isbn=978-0826266156 |location=Columbia |oclc=427509646}}</ref>\n\n==Writing career==\nAn invitation to submit an article to the ''Missouri Ruralist'' in 1911 led to Wilder's permanent position as a columnist and editor with that publication, which she held until the mid-1920s. She also took a paid position with the local [[Federal Farm Loan Act|Farm Loan Association]], dispensing small loans to local farmers.\n\nWilder's column in the ''Ruralist'', \"As a Farm Woman Thinks\", introduced her to a loyal audience of rural [[Ozarks|Ozarkians]], who enjoyed her regular columns. Her topics ranged from home and family, including her 1915 trip to [[San Francisco, California]], to visit Rose Lane and the Pan-Pacific exhibition, to [[World War I]] and other world events, and to the fascinating world travels of Lane as well as her own thoughts on the increasing options offered to women during this era. While the couple were never wealthy until the \"Little House\" books began to achieve popularity, the farming operation and Wilder's income from writing and the Farm Loan Association provided them with a stable living.\n\n\"[By] 1924\", according to the Professor John E. Miller, \"[a]fter more than a decade of writing for farm papers, Wilder had become a disciplined writer, able to produce thoughtful, readable prose for a general audience.\" At this time, her now-married daughter, Rose Wilder Lane, helped her publish two articles describing the interior of the farmhouse, in ''Country Gentleman'' magazine.<ref>Miller 1998, p. 161.</ref>\n\nIt was also around this time that Lane began intensively encouraging Wilder to improve her writing skills with a view toward greater success as a writer than Lane had already achieved.<ref>Miller 1998, p. 162.</ref>  The Wilders, according to Miller, had come to \"[depend] on annual income subsidies from their increasingly famous and successful daughter.\" They both had concluded that the solution for improving their retirement income was for Wilder to become a successful writer herself. However, the \"project never proceeded very far.\"<ref>Miller 2008, p. 24.</ref>\n\nIn 1928, Lane hired out the construction of an English-style stone cottage for her parents on property adjacent to the farmhouse they had personally built and still inhabited. She remodeled and took it over.<ref name=Miller1998-177>Miller 1998, p. 177.</ref>\n\n===''Little House'' books===\n{{main|List of Little House on the Prairie books}}\n\nThe [[Wall Street Crash of 1929|Stock Market Crash of 1929]] wiped the Wilders out; Lane's investments were devastated as well. They still owned the 200-acre (81-hectare) farm, but they had invested most of their savings with Lane's broker. In 1930, Wilder requested Lane's opinion about an autobiographical manuscript she had written about her pioneering childhood. The [[Great Depression]], coupled with the deaths of Wilder's mother in 1924 and her older sister in 1928, seem to have prompted her to preserve her memories in a life story called ''Pioneer Girl''. She also hoped that her writing would generate some additional income. The original title of the first of the books was ''When Grandma Was a Little Girl''.<ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=Students visiting Wilder's prairie|last=Hines-Dochterman|first=Meredith|date=30 September 2005|work=St. Joseph News-Press|access-date=}}</ref> On the advice of Lane's publisher, she greatly expanded the story. As a result of Lane's publishing connections as a successful writer and after editing by her, [[Harper (publisher)#Harper & Brothers (1833\u20131962)|Harper & Brothers]] published Wilder's book in 1932 as ''Little House in the Big Woods''. After its success, she continued writing. The close and often rocky collaboration between her and Lane continued, in person until 1935, when Lane permanently left Rocky Ridge Farm, and afterward by correspondence.\n\nThe collaboration worked both ways: two of Lane's most successful novels, ''Let the Hurricane Roar'' (1932) and ''Free Land'' (1938), were written at the same time as the \"Little House\" series and basically retold Ingalls and Wilder family tales in an adult format.<ref name=Miller2008-40>Miller 2008, p. 40.</ref>\n\n====Authorship controversy====\nSome, including Lane's biographer, William Holtz, have alleged that Wilder's daughter was her ghostwriter.<ref>Holtz 1993.{{full citation needed|date=October 2015}}<!-- page needed --></ref>  Existing evidence includes ongoing correspondence between the women about the books' development, Lane's extensive diaries, and Wilder's handwritten manuscripts with edit notations shows an ongoing collaboration between the two women.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\nMiller, using this record, describes varying levels of involvement by Lane. ''[[Little House in the Big Woods]]'' (1932) and ''[[These Happy Golden Years]]'' (1943), he notes, received the least editing. \"The first pages&nbsp;... and other large sections of [''Big Woods'']\", he observes, \"stand largely intact, indicating&nbsp;... from the start&nbsp;...[Laura's] talent for narrative description.\"<ref>Miller 1998, pp. 6, 190.</ref>  Some volumes saw heavier participation by Lane,<ref>Miller 2008, pp. 37 et seq.</ref> while [[The First Four Years (novel)|''The First Four Years'']] (1971) appears to be exclusively a Wilder work.<ref name=thurman2009>{{cite web |author=Thurman, Judith |url=http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/atlarge/2009/08/10/090810crat_atlarge_thurman?currentPage=paragraph-29 |title=Wilder Women: The mother and daughter behind the Little House stories |date=August 10, 2009 |work=The New Yorker |accessdate=February 8, 2015 }}</ref>\nConcludes Miller, \"In the end, the lasting literary legacy remains that of the mother more than that of the daughter&nbsp;... Lane possessed style; Wilder had substance.\"<ref name=Miller2008-40/>\n\nThe controversy over authorship is often tied to the movement to read the Little House series through an ideological lens. Lane emerged in the 1930s as an avowed conservative polemicist and critic of the [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] administration and his [[New Deal]] programs. According to a 2012 article in the ''New Yorker'', \"When Roosevelt was elected, she noted in her diary, 'America has a dictator.' She prayed for his assassination, and considered doing the job herself.\"<ref name=thurman2012>{{cite web |author=Thurman, Judith |url=http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/a-libertarian-house-on-the-prairie |title=A Libertarian House on the Prairie |date=August 16, 2012 |work=The New Yorker |accessdate=February 8, 2015 }}</ref> Whatever Lane's politics, \"attacks on [Wilder's] authorship seem aimed at infusing her books with ideological passions they just don't have.\"<ref name=\"salon.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2012/10/10/little_house_on_the_prairie_tea_party_manifesto |title='Little House on the Prairie': Tea Party manifesto |author=Fraser, Caroline |work=Los Angeles Review of Books |date=October 10, 2012 |via=''[[Salon (website)|Salon]]'' (salon.com) |accessdate=February 8, 2015 }}</ref>\n\n====Enduring appeal====\nThe original Little House books, written for [[elementary school]]\u2013age children, became an enduring, eight-volume record of pioneering life late in the 19th century based on the Ingalls family's experiences on the American frontier. ''The First Four Years'', about the early days of the Wilder marriage, was discovered by her literary executor [[Roger MacBride]] after Lane's 1968 death and published in 1971, unedited by Lane or MacBride. It is now marketed as the ninth volume.<ref name=thurman2009/>\n\nSince the publication of ''Little House in the Big Woods'' (1932), the books have been continuously in print and have been translated into 40 other languages. Wilder's first\u2014and smallest\u2014royalty check from Harper, in 1932, was for $500, {{Inflation|US|500|1932|r=-1|fmt=eq}}. By the mid-1930s the royalties from the ''Little House'' books brought a steady and increasingly substantial income to the Wilders for the first time in their 50 years of marriage. The collaboration also brought the two writers at Rocky Ridge Farm the money they needed to recoup the loss of their investments in the stock market. Various honors, huge amounts of fan mail, and other accolades were bestowed on Wilder.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\n===Autobiography: ''Pioneer Girl''===\nIn 1929\u20131930, already in her early 60s, Wilder began writing her autobiography, titled ''Pioneer Girl.'' It was rejected by publishers. At Lane's urging, she rewrote most of her stories for children. The result was the ''Little House'' series of books. In 2014, the [[South Dakota State Historical Society]] published an annotated version of Wilder's autobiography, titled ''Pioneer Girl: The Annotated Autobiography''.<ref name=SDHS>[http://pioneergirlproject.org/2014/11/21/pioneer-girl-is-out \"Pioneer Girl is out!\"].

Most of the surrounding area (including the property with the stone cottage Lane had built for them) was sold, but they still kept some farm animals, and tended their flower beds and vegetable gardens. Almost daily, carloads of fans stopped by, eager to meet the \"Laura\" of the ''Little House'' books.\n\nThe Wilders lived independently and without financial worries until Almanzo's death at the farm in 1949 at age 92. Wilder remained on the farm. For the next eight years, she lived alone, looked after by a circle of neighbors and friends. She continued an active correspondence with her editors, fans, and friends during these years.\n\n[[File:Almanzo and Laura Wilder gravesite Mansfield MO.jpg|thumb|right|Gravesite of Laura Ingalls Wilder and husband Almanzo Wilder at Mansfield Cemetery, Mansfield, Missouri.

During the [[Boston Marathon]], brothers [[Dzhokhar Tsarnaev|Dzhokhar]] and [[Tamerlan Tsarnaev]] detonate two bombs, causing widespread panic. A young couple, Patrick Downes and Jessica Kensky, are injured and taken to separate hospitals, where they are both required to have their legs amputated. Steve Woolfenden, a family man, is also injured and separated from his toddler son, Leo, who is taken by the police to a safe location.\n\nFBI agent Richard DesLauriers is assigned to investigate the bombings in collaboration with  Boston police commissioner [[Edward F. Davis|Ed Davis]], while Police Sergeant Tommy Saunders searches for evidence and helps people that have been injured or separated from their loved ones in the chaos, including Patrick, Jessica, Steven and Leo. FBI analysts review footage of the bombing and identify Dzhokhar and Tamerlan as suspects, but DesLauriers is reluctant to release their pictures to the public without further evidence. His hand is forced when the pictures are leaked to the press, while Pugliese's men begin conducting door-to-door searches for the pair.\n\nDzhokhar and Tamerlan kill officer [[Sean Collier]] in a failed attempt to [[steal]] his pistol, and then carjack student Dun Meng, telling him of their plans to conduct another bombing in [[New York City]]. Just as Dzhokhar enters the [[Shell Gas]] station [[convenience store]], Meng leaves from the vehicle, and runs away fearfully to the [[Mobil]] Gas Station so that he can call the police; the brothers flee in the stolen car. Saunders arrives at the scene, learns of the brothers' plan and is given the stolen car's GPS tracking number, leading police to the pair, which leads to an armed confrontation. The ensuing shootout where the brothers use both firearms and bombs, sees several officers injured. While Tamerlan is shooting, Watertown Police Sergeant Jeffrey Pugliese fires at his ankle, wounding him and hindering his ability to gather more explosives. Tamerlan orders Dzhokhar to run to New York City to continue the rampage while he makes a last stand. As Tamerlan is subdued by the police, Dzhokhar runs over his brother in his flight, killing him as he escapes in the chaos.\n\nMeanwhile, Tamerlan's wife Katherine Russell and Dzhokhar's college friends are detained by the [[Hostage Rescue Team|FBI Hostage Rescue Team]] and questioned by the [[High-Value Interrogation Group]]. Katherine refuses to disclose any knowledge of her husband's illegal activities, paraphrasing the Quran in defiance, while Dzhokhar's friends appear oblivious to his plans, despite having earlier found bomb components in his possessions. A local man named David Henneberry later finds Dzhokhar hiding under the sheets of his boat and calls the police. Dzhokhar is quickly surrounded and arrested after a brief standoff, as Saunders and his colleagues celebrate. The Boston police are invited to attend a [[Boston Red Sox]] game, where [[David Ortiz]] thanks them for their heroism and tells them to \"stay strong\".\n\nDzhokhar was convicted on thirty counts and sentenced to death by [[lethal injection]] and is currently waiting for his appeal in [[ADX Florence|federal prison]]; his three college friends were arrested for obstructing the bombing investigation and authorities are continuing to seek information regarding Russell's possible involvement in the bombings.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Mark Wahlberg]] as [[Boston Police Department]] Sergeant Tommy Saunders \n* [[Kevin Bacon]] as Richard DesLauriers, Special Agent in Charge of the FBI Boston field office\n* [[John Goodman]] as Boston Police Commissioner [[Ed Davis (police commissioner)|Ed Davis]]<ref name=\"GoodmanCast\" />\n* [[J.

During the [[Boston Marathon]], brothers [[Dzhokhar Tsarnaev|Dzhokhar]] and [[Tamerlan Tsarnaev]] detonate two bombs, causing widespread panic. A young couple, Patrick Downes and Jessica Kensky, are injured and taken to separate hospitals, where they are both required to have their legs amputated. Steve Woolfenden, a family man, is also injured and separated from his toddler son, Leo, who is taken by the police to a safe location.\n\nFBI agent Richard DesLauriers is assigned to investigate the bombings in collaboration with  Boston police commissioner [[Edward F. Davis|Ed Davis]], while Police Sergeant Tommy Saunders searches for evidence and helps people that have been injured or separated from their loved ones in the chaos, including Patrick, Jessica, Steven and Leo. FBI analysts review footage of the bombing and identify Dzhokhar and Tamerlan as suspects, but DesLauriers is reluctant to release their pictures to the public without further evidence. His hand is forced when the pictures are leaked to the press, while Pugliese's men begin conducting door-to-door searches for the pair.\n\nDzhokhar and Tamerlan kill officer [[Sean Collier]] in a failed attempt to [[steal]] his pistol, and then carjack student Dun Meng, telling him of their plans to conduct another bombing in [[New York City]]. Just as Dzhokhar enters the [[Shell Gas]] station [[convenience store]], Meng leaves from the vehicle, and runs away fearfully to the [[Mobil]] Gas Station so that he can call the police; the brothers flee in the stolen car. Saunders arrives at the scene, learns of the brothers' plan and is given the stolen car's GPS tracking number, leading police to the pair, which leads to an armed confrontation. The ensuing shootout where the brothers use both firearms and bombs, sees several officers injured. While Tamerlan is shooting, Watertown Police Sergeant Jeffrey Pugliese fires at his ankle, wounding him and hindering his ability to gather more explosives. Tamerlan orders Dzhokhar to run to New York City to continue the rampage while he makes a last stand. As Tamerlan is subdued by the police, Dzhokhar runs over his brother in his flight, killing him as he escapes in the chaos.\n\nMeanwhile, Tamerlan's wife Katherine Russell and Dzhokhar's college friends are detained by the [[Hostage Rescue Team|FBI Hostage Rescue Team]] and questioned by the [[High-Value Interrogation Group]]. Katherine refuses to disclose any knowledge of her husband's illegal activities, paraphrasing the Quran in defiance, while Dzhokhar's friends appear oblivious to his plans, despite having earlier found bomb components in his possessions. A local man named David Henneberry later finds Dzhokhar hiding under the sheets of his boat and calls the police. Dzhokhar is quickly surrounded and arrested after a brief standoff, as Saunders and his colleagues celebrate. The Boston police are invited to attend a [[Boston Red Sox]] game, where [[David Ortiz]] thanks them for their heroism and tells them to \"stay strong\".\n\nDzhokhar was convicted on thirty counts and sentenced to death by [[lethal injection]] and is currently waiting for his appeal in [[ADX Florence|federal prison]]; his three college friends were arrested for obstructing the bombing investigation and authorities are continuing to seek information regarding Russell's possible involvement in the bombings.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Mark Wahlberg]] as [[Boston Police Department]] Sergeant Tommy Saunders \n* [[Kevin Bacon]] as Richard DesLauriers, Special Agent in Charge of the FBI Boston field office\n* [[John Goodman]] as Boston Police Commissioner [[Ed Davis (police commissioner)|Ed Davis]]<ref name=\"GoodmanCast\" />\n* [[J.

(Seal himself did partnership with Fergusson Brothers, they did not ask him to convert to [[Christianity]] to do business. Education was not provided for converting to Christianity, many of the people educated outside India at the time were Christians, including [[Mahatma Gandhi]].) To counter this, there was an anti-missionary movement led by the rich and influential [[Babu (title)|Babu]] of Calcutta for a free national school of their own. \n\nOne afternoon they all assembled in a meeting presided over by [[Radhakanta Deb|Raja Radha Kanta Deb]] at the [[Oriental Seminary]]. Many speeches were made and resolutions adopted, but donations recorded in the subscription book were scant. When the book passed to the hand of Seal, he immediately put down his name for one [[Lakh]] of rupees. Others who had estimated contributing a few hundred or a few thousand rupees panicked and the meeting ended.\n\nPledged to his subscription, Seal carried out the promise of a national institution with his own independent efforts. On Wednesday, 1 March 1842, a gathering of respectable people took place at his house for the formal opening of the Mutty Lall Seal's Free College. Among those present were Sir Lawrence Peel, the Chief Justice; Sir [[John Peter Grant]]; Mr. Lyall, the Advocate-General; Mr. Leith and the other principal members of the Calcutta Bar; Captain Birch, Superintendent of the Police; Mr. George Thompson; Right Reverend Dr. Carew; Baboo [[Dwarkanath Tagore]]; Baboo [[Ramkamal Sen]]; Baboo Russomoy Dutt and Revd. [[Krishna Mohan Banerjee]]. The Catholic Bishop and all the clergy of the Catholic Cathedral, as well as all the Professors of [[St. Xavier's College, Calcutta|St. Xavier's College]], were likewise present. Nearly the whole of the dissenting ministers and missionaries of Calcutta and its neighbourhood also attended.<ref>''The Catholic Cabinet, And Chronicle of Religious Intelligence, Containing Original And Selected Articles, A Monthly Periodical'', Volume I, 1843, p 187</ref> There were eloquent speeches in testimony to his noble generosity and liberal mindset with Mr. George Thompson complimenting him as \"a Hindu gentleman, who had nobly resolved to consecrate a large portion of the substances he had acquired by honorable exertion, to the intellectual improvement of the youth of his own nation to transmute his money into mind\"''.<ref>Mullick, Promatha Nath, ''History of Vaisyas of Bengal'', p 136-139</ref>''\n\nMutty Lall Seal's Free College (later renamed Mutty Lall Seal's Free School and College) was to provide for the education of Hindus to enable them to occupy posts of trust and emolument in their own country. This education included [[English Literature]], History, [[Geography]], [[Elocution]], Writing, [[Arithmetic]], [[Algebra]], Philosophical Sciences, [[Further Mathematics|Higher Mathematics]] and the practical application of Mathematics. The institution was opened free of cost, only one rupee was charged per month to cover expenses such as books and stationery and the surplus being expended towards furnishing the school with mathematical instruments. The number of students receiving education at one time was to be limited to 500. The institute was initially under the management of the Directors of the parent college of [[St. Xavier's College, Calcutta|St. F. Xavier]], Chowringhee, Calcutta, who furnished teachers to further the cause of [[secular education]].<ref>''Goethals News'', Vol. IV, No. 3 Bulletin, July \u2013 September 2001</ref>\n\nAlthough [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] had the responsibility of imparting education, the conductors had pledged themselves to withhold all Christian instruction from the pupils.<ref>''The Calcutta Review'', Vol. II, October\u2013December 1844, p 73</ref> However, later Seal dissolved the connection between his college and the Jesuits over a dispute that in violation of their pledge, viands were distributed among the Hindu boys contrary to their religious sentiments. The institute was then placed under Revd. [[Krishna Mohan Banerjee]].<ref>''The Indian Mail, A Monthly Register For British & Foreign India, China, & Australasia'', Vol. I, May\u2013December 1843, p 614-615</ref> A sum of Rs. 12,000 was spent yearly for the upkeep of the college from his trust. The college stood in high estimation of the public and competed successfully with the Government and Missionary Colleges in the university examinations ([[Suniti Kumar Chatterji]] and [[A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada|Swami Prabhupada]] were some students of the college). The college initially started functioning at Seal's house and was later shifted to the present building on [[Chittaranjan Avenue]] where it still exists.\n\nThe other charities which have made his name known to the public are contained in a deed of trust; by which he donated a considerable portion of his property (amounting to several [[Lakh]] of rupees) for the good of the public. A net yearly income of Rs. 36,000 derived from those properties were spent for various charitable purposes. Apart from running and maintaining the college, about Rs. 4,000 was spent on helping poor widows and orphans every year and for running and maintaining two alms houses for the poor and underprivileged.<ref>''The Calcutta Review'', Vol. CXI, Calcutta, 1900, p 86-88</ref> He extended financial support and co-operation for the establishment of the Hindu Charitable Institution and Hindu Metropolitan College. Seal's Free School, Hindu Metropolitan College and some of the other institutions of the time were calculated to offset the 'ill effects' of the liberal education offered at the [[Presidency College, Kolkata|Hindu College]].<ref>Majumdar, Swapan, ''Literature and Literary Life in Old Calcutta'', in ''Calcutta, the Living City'', Vol I, p 110.</ref>\n<gallery>\nImage:Mutty Lal Seal's devalaya at Belghoria.jpg|Devalaya at Mutty Lall Seal's Belghoria alms house\nImage:Mutty Lal Seal's guest house at Behala.jpg|Mutty Lall Seal's guest house at Behala\nImage:Mutty Lal Seal's bathing ghat.jpg|Mutty Lall Seal's bathing ghat on the bank of river Hooghly\nImage:Mutty Lal Seal's Free School.jpg|Mutty Lall Seal's Free School & College - Estd. 1842\n</gallery>\n\n==Later life==\nWhen he was alive, the native society of Kolkata was divided into two parts. One was the reformist section led by [[Ram Mohan Roy|Raja Rammohun Roy]] and the other was the conservative section led by [[Radhakanta Deb|Radha Kanta Deb]]. Most of the rich people of Kolkata were in the latter group. Deb strongly opposed both the move to ban [[Sati (practice)|sati]] and efforts for remarriage of widows, many of whom were child-widows. Although Seal was a conservative, he was in favor of Roy's efforts of banning sati, supported the cause of women's education as well as remarriage of widows. He made a public offer for a dowry of 1000 rupees to the person who should have the courage to break through the ancient prejudices of caste and marry a widow.<ref>Ripley, George, Dana, Charles A.,''The New American Cyclopaedia: A Popular Dictionary Of General Knowledge'', Vol. II, 1859, p 443</ref> When Seal died on 20 May 1854, his obituary in the ''Hindu Intelligence'' described him as the \"richest and most virtuous [[Babu (title)|Babu]] of Calcutta\".<ref>Sengupta, Nitish, ''History Of The Bengali Speaking People'', p 259-260</ref> One of the busy streets in Kolkata's business district is named after him as 'Moti Sil Street'.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading ==\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{Citation\n | surname1 = Chaudhuri \n | given1 = Sukanta (Ed)\n | year = 1995\n | title = Calcutta: The Living City\n | edition = \n | publisher= [[Oxford University Press]]\n | ISBN = 0-19-563698-8\n}}\n* Sastri, Sivanath, ''Ramtanu Lahiri O Tatkalin Banga Samaj'' in Bengali (1903/2001), p 48, New Age Publishers Pvt.

Nearly the whole of the dissenting ministers and missionaries of Calcutta and its neighbourhood also attended.<ref>''The Catholic Cabinet, And Chronicle of Religious Intelligence, Containing Original And Selected Articles, A Monthly Periodical'', Volume I, 1843, p 187</ref> There were eloquent speeches in testimony to his noble generosity and liberal mindset with Mr. George Thompson complimenting him as \"a Hindu gentleman, who had nobly resolved to consecrate a large portion of the substances he had acquired by honorable exertion, to the intellectual improvement of the youth of his own nation to transmute his money into mind\"''.<ref>Mullick, Promatha Nath, ''History of Vaisyas of Bengal'', p 136-139</ref>''\n\nMutty Lall Seal's Free College (later renamed Mutty Lall Seal's Free School and College) was to provide for the education of Hindus to enable them to occupy posts of trust and emolument in their own country. This education included [[English Literature]], History, [[Geography]], [[Elocution]], Writing, [[Arithmetic]], [[Algebra]], Philosophical Sciences, [[Further Mathematics|Higher Mathematics]] and the practical application of Mathematics. The institution was opened free of cost, only one rupee was charged per month to cover expenses such as books and stationery and the surplus being expended towards furnishing the school with mathematical instruments. The number of students receiving education at one time was to be limited to 500. The institute was initially under the management of the Directors of the parent college of [[St. Xavier's College, Calcutta|St. F. Xavier]], Chowringhee, Calcutta, who furnished teachers to further the cause of [[secular education]].<ref>''Goethals News'', Vol. IV, No. 3 Bulletin, July \u2013 September 2001</ref>\n\nAlthough [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] had the responsibility of imparting education, the conductors had pledged themselves to withhold all Christian instruction from the pupils.<ref>''The Calcutta Review'', Vol. II, October\u2013December 1844, p 73</ref> However, later Seal dissolved the connection between his college and the Jesuits over a dispute that in violation of their pledge, viands were distributed among the Hindu boys contrary to their religious sentiments. The institute was then placed under Revd. [[Krishna Mohan Banerjee]].<ref>''The Indian Mail, A Monthly Register For British & Foreign India, China, & Australasia'', Vol. I, May\u2013December 1843, p 614-615</ref> A sum of Rs. 12,000 was spent yearly for the upkeep of the college from his trust. The college stood in high estimation of the public and competed successfully with the Government and Missionary Colleges in the university examinations ([[Suniti Kumar Chatterji]] and [[A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada|Swami Prabhupada]] were some students of the college). The college initially started functioning at Seal's house and was later shifted to the present building on [[Chittaranjan Avenue]] where it still exists.\n\nThe other charities which have made his name known to the public are contained in a deed of trust; by which he donated a considerable portion of his property (amounting to several [[Lakh]] of rupees) for the good of the public. A net yearly income of Rs. 36,000 derived from those properties were spent for various charitable purposes. Apart from running and maintaining the college, about Rs. 4,000 was spent on helping poor widows and orphans every year and for running and maintaining two alms houses for the poor and underprivileged.<ref>''The Calcutta Review'', Vol. CXI, Calcutta, 1900, p 86-88</ref> He extended financial support and co-operation for the establishment of the Hindu Charitable Institution and Hindu Metropolitan College. Seal's Free School, Hindu Metropolitan College and some of the other institutions of the time were calculated to offset the 'ill effects' of the liberal education offered at the [[Presidency College, Kolkata|Hindu College]].<ref>Majumdar, Swapan, ''Literature and Literary Life in Old Calcutta'', in ''Calcutta, the Living City'', Vol I, p 110.</ref>\n<gallery>\nImage:Mutty Lal Seal's devalaya at Belghoria.jpg|Devalaya at Mutty Lall Seal's Belghoria alms house\nImage:Mutty Lal Seal's guest house at Behala.jpg|Mutty Lall Seal's guest house at Behala\nImage:Mutty Lal Seal's bathing ghat.jpg|Mutty Lall Seal's bathing ghat on the bank of river Hooghly\nImage:Mutty Lal Seal's Free School.jpg|Mutty Lall Seal's Free School & College - Estd. 1842\n</gallery>\n\n==Later life==\nWhen he was alive, the native society of Kolkata was divided into two parts. One was the reformist section led by [[Ram Mohan Roy|Raja Rammohun Roy]] and the other was the conservative section led by [[Radhakanta Deb|Radha Kanta Deb]]. Most of the rich people of Kolkata were in the latter group. Deb strongly opposed both the move to ban [[Sati (practice)|sati]] and efforts for remarriage of widows, many of whom were child-widows. Although Seal was a conservative, he was in favor of Roy's efforts of banning sati, supported the cause of women's education as well as remarriage of widows. He made a public offer for a dowry of 1000 rupees to the person who should have the courage to break through the ancient prejudices of caste and marry a widow.<ref>Ripley, George, Dana, Charles A.,''The New American Cyclopaedia: A Popular Dictionary Of General Knowledge'', Vol. II, 1859, p 443</ref> When Seal died on 20 May 1854, his obituary in the ''Hindu Intelligence'' described him as the \"richest and most virtuous [[Babu (title)|Babu]] of Calcutta\".<ref>Sengupta, Nitish, ''History Of The Bengali Speaking People'', p 259-260</ref> One of the busy streets in Kolkata's business district is named after him as 'Moti Sil Street'.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading ==\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{Citation\n | surname1 = Chaudhuri \n | given1 = Sukanta (Ed)\n | year = 1995\n | title = Calcutta: The Living City\n | edition = \n | publisher= [[Oxford University Press]]\n | ISBN = 0-19-563698-8\n}}\n* Sastri, Sivanath, ''Ramtanu Lahiri O Tatkalin Banga Samaj'' in Bengali (1903/2001), p 48, New Age Publishers Pvt.
