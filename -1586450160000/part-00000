Ranna wrote this ''purana'' under the patronage of a Jain lady called [[Attimabbe]], the wife of general Nagavarma.{{sfn|Sastri|2002|p=356}} ''Ranna Kanda'' (990 C.E.), so called because it is written in the ''Kanda'' meter, is the earliest extant lexicon in the Kannada language.

Written around 1000 C.E. (though some scholars believe it was a product of a more youthful Ranna), it is one of the enduring classics of the language where the poet compares the valor of his patron Chalukya King Satyashraya to the [[Pandava]] prince [[Bhima]] of the Hindu epic [[Mahabharata]].{{sfn|Datta|1988|p=1335}} Ranna keeps with the trend started by Adikavi Pampa who in 941 C.E. compared his patron Chalukya King Arikesari (a [[Rashtrakuta dynasty|Rashtrakuta]] vassal) to the Pandava prince [[Arjuna]] in the classic ''Vikramarjunavijaya'' (also called ''Pampa Bharata'').{{sfn|Datta|1988|p=1335}} While acknowledging that Ranna may have found some inspiration from earlier writings such as ''Urubhanga'' of Bhasa and ''Venisamhara'' or Bhattanarayana, scholars concede that ''Gadayuddha'' has an originality of its own. Modern scholars see similarities between Ranna's usage of the \"adult imps\" (called ''murulgal'') that stalk the battlefield of [[Kurukshetra]] and warn [[Kaurava]] prince [[Duryodhana]] (Bhima's adversary in battle) about his impending death, and the description of witches by latter day famed English playwright, [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]. Some scholars believe that ''Gadayuddha'' may have been conceived as a play before being completed as a ''champukavya'' (epic poem in ''[[kavya]]'' style and ''[[champu]]'' meter).{{sfn|Datta|1988|pp=1335-1336}}\n\nWhile the theme of the narration centers around the battle of maces between Bhima and Duryodhana on the last day of the eighteen-day war, the poet uses a technique similar to flashbacks in modern cinema to enlighten the reader with important events that led to the war and those events that transpired on the battlefield.{{sfn|Datta|1988|p=1336}} Bhima is undoubtedly the hero of the day for slaying his foe and thus avenging the insult suffered by his wife [[Draupadi]] at the hands of Dushshasana (Duryodhana's brother) prior to the war. However, Ranna skillfully depicts Duryodhana as a \"great soul\" (''mahanubhava''), who despite his sins, was a brave ''[[kshatriya]]'' on the battlefield, and a true friend to [[Karna]] (another important character in the epic).{{sfn|Datta|1988|p=1336}}\n\n==See also==\n{{commons category|Kannada language literature}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n* {{citation |last=Kamath |first=Suryanath U. |authorlink=Suryanath U.

The screenplay concerns a family with 18 children. The film, a remake of [[Yours, Mine and Ours (1968 film)|the 1968 film of the same name]], was released on November 23, 2005. It was produced by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], [[Nickelodeon Movies]], and Robert Simonds Company, and was distributed by [[Paramount Pictures]] and [[Columbia Pictures]].\n\n==Plot==\nFrank Beardsley is a widowed [[United States Coast Guard|U.S. Coast Guard]] admiral who moves back to his hometown of [[New London, Connecticut]] with his 8 kids from his previous marriage. Helen North, a widowed handbag designer with ten kids (four biological, six adopted) takes a more relaxed approach on life. After unexpectedly encountering each other at a restaurant while on separate dates, they do so again at their 30-year high school reunion.\n\nInstantly rekindling their old sparks, Frank and Helen quickly decide to marry in a private ceremony, to the Beardsley and North kids' shock. They move into a new home on the same property where they shared their first kiss, joined by the North children's numerous pets (including a [[pot-bellied pig]] and a [[hamster]]), and Frank's housekeeper, Mrs. Munion.\n\nIt soon becomes apparent that Frank has a very regimented view of how things should be done, whereas Helen is an artist (a designer by trade) with a more free-spirited, lackadaisical attitude. Their respective children are shocked by the news of their parents' quick wedding and do not get along well at first, even turning a planned lighthouse renovation project into an all-out paint fight.\n\nFrank's oldest son, William, calls a meeting among his siblings and explains that they can better rid themselves of their new situation by joining forces to make their parents' respective philosophical differences apparent, which will cause them to fight. But while doing so, they gradually begin to bond, attending their siblings' soccer games and helping William in his class president campaign.\n\nA short time later, Frank and Helen attend a formal Coast Guard dinner where his superior, Commandant Sherman, officially offers him the opportunity to be his successor. He respectfully declines it, citing both his obligation to the Coast Guard Academy and his new family. Meanwhile, as the young children have a [[food fight]] upstairs in the bedroom, the older ones throw a wild party downstairs. When their parents return to find the place in total chaos, Frank is furious, and while Helen is also upset, her more laid-back approach only angers him more. This causes their worst fight yet, and the children, realizing how happy their parents have been together, begin to realize that they might have pushed things too far.\n\nThe next day, Frank informs Helen that he has decided to take the position as Commandant after all, and they schedule a family meeting to inform the children. As the children return home from school, jubilant over having defended their younger siblings from bullies and with the news of William having won the class election, Frank quickly deflates the mood by telling them of his decision to accept the new position. Feeling guilty for having torn their parents apart, they set about undoing their mistakes, even enlisting Helen to aid in their efforts. Together, the older ones launch the family's boat in an effort to catch Frank (thereby fulfilling his previous dream of having an all-family sailing team that failed earlier), but he is convinced that Helen no longer wants to be with him, until he sees her turn on the lighthouse spotlight (a reference to a story Frank had told her about a beautiful female lighthouse keeper). Successfully reunited, they tie the knot once again, this time with the children involved.\n\n==Cast==\n'''The North-Beardsley Family'''\n* [[Dennis Quaid]] as Frank Beardsley\n* [[Rene Russo]] as Helen North, Frank's 2nd wife\n* [[Sean Faris]] as William Beardsley, Frank's son and Helen's stepson (1st child)\n* [[Danielle Panabaker]] as Phoebe North, Helen's daughter and Frank's stepdaughter (2nd child)\n* [[Katija Pevec]] as Christina Beardsley, Frank's daughter and Helen's stepdaughter (3rd child)\n* [[Drake Bell]] as Dylan North, Helen's son and Frank's stepson (4th child)\n* [[Lil' JJ]] as Jimi North, Helen's adoptive son and Frank's adoptive stepson (5th child)\n* [[Dean Collins (actor)|Dean Collins]] as Harry Beardsley, Frank's son and Helen's stepson (6th child)\n* [[Miki Ishikawa]] as Naoko North, Helen's adoptive daughter and Frank's adoptive stepdaughter (7th child)\n* [[Miranda Cosgrove]] as Joni North, Helen's daughter and Frank's stepdaughter (8th child)\n* [[Tyler Patrick Jones]] as Michael Beardsley, Frank's son and Helen's stepson (9th child)\n* [[Haley Ramm]] as Kelly Beardsley, Frank's daughter and Helen's stepdaughter (10th child)\n* Slade Pearce as Mick North, Helen's son and Frank's stepson (11th child)\n* Andrew Vo as Lau North, Helen's adoptive son and Frank's adoptive stepson (12th child)\n* Brecken Palmer as Ely Beardsley, Otter's twin brother, Frank's son and Helen's stepson (13th child)\n* Bridger Palmer as Otter Beardsley, Ely's twin brother, Frank's son and Helen's stepson (14th child)\n* Jennifer Habib as Bina North, Marisa's twin sister, Helen's adoptive daughter and Frank's adoptive stepdaughter (15th child)\n* Jessica Habib as Marisa North, Bina's twin sister, Helen's adoptive daugther and Frank's stepdaughter (16th child)\n* Nicholas Roget-King as Aldo North, Helen's adoptive son and Frank's adoptive stepson (17th child)\n* [[Ty Panitz]] as Ethan Beardsley, Frank's son and Helen's stepson (18th & last child)\n'''Others'''\n* [[Rip Torn]] as Admiral Sherman, [[Commandant of the Coast Guard]]\n* [[Linda Hunt]] as Mrs. Munion, North-Beardsley's housekeeper\n* [[Jerry O'Connell]] as Max Algrant\n* [[David Koechner]] as Captain Darrell Edwards\n* Jenica Bergere as Claudia\n* [[Josh Henderson]] as Nick De Pietro, Christina's boyfriend \n* [[Dan Mott]] as Pizza Delivery Guy\n\n==Release==\n\n=== Promotion === \nQuaid and some of the child actors appeared on the November 22, 2005 episode of ''[[Dr. Phil (TV series)|Dr. Phil]]'' to promote the film.<ref>http://www.drphil.com/shows/show/629/</ref>\n\n===Box office===\nThe film opened at number three, with an opening weekend of $17,461,108 in the US.<ref name=\"Weekend Gross\">{{cite web |url= http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=weekend&id=yoursmineandours.htm |title=Yours, Mine and Ours (2005) - Weekend Box Office Results |accessdate=2008-07-06 |publisher= IMDB | work = [[Box Office Mojo]] }}</ref> \nIts final North American box office was $53,412,862, and its international box office was $18,615,890, earning a combined total of  $72,028,752, well above its $45 million production budget.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=main&id=yoursmineandours.htm |title=Yours Mine and Ours (2005) |publisher= IMDB | work = [[Box Office Mojo]] |accessdate=2010-12-05}}</ref>\n\n===Critical reception===\nThe film received generally negative reviews from critics but mixed to positive reviews from audiences.

The potential beneficiaries form five teams and get involved in various misadventures.\n\nThe five teams consist of:\n\n# Parker's widowed son-in-law Henry Motley and his four children Michelle, Scott, Jason & Jennifer.\n# The servants: French cook Henri, valet Jenkins, limo driver Jackson and French maid Babbette.\n# Dim-witted taxi driver Marvin Dummitz.\n# Parker's widowed sister Mildred Carruthers, her attorney Stuart Sellsome, and her son Georgie.\n# Parker's nephews The Stevens Brothers Jeff & Kenny, and Milton's widowed daughter Lisa.\n\nEach group is given a list containing clues to acquire 100 items with various point values ranging from 5 to 100 points. The items are to be acquired by any means necessary, with the exception of being purchased. They are to be placed in five different pens on the grounds of the estate. The winner of the scavenger hunt will be the person or team to acquire the most points by 5 p.m. that day.\n\nChaos and carnage ensue, with scavengers returning occasionally to the Parker mansion to deposit items under the supervision of Bernstein and the scorekeeper, Cornfeld.\n\nMildred, Stuart and Georgie's adventure has them trying to win a stuffed toy bear at a local carnival, trying to haul a heavy safe out of Stuart's office building, and stealing the false teeth of a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]].

A bulletproof vest is borrowed from a self-defense-obsessed lady named Arvilla ([[Ruth Gordon]]) and they acquire \"laughing gas,\" steal a uniform from a motorcycle cop, and get stuck in a football team's locker room trying to steal a helmet. \n\nDummittz' adventure has him trying unsuccessfully to steal a Rolls Royce front grill and getting run over many times while trying to replicate an insurance scam he witnesses. A bridal shop security guard named Sam catches him attempting to steal a bridal dress. Sam joins the hunt. Together they steal a knight's suit of armor from a museum, with Marvin dressing up as a mummy and Sam putting on the armor. Sam, knocked unconscious, is stolen by the Mildred-Stuart-Georgie team. Marvin then teams up with obese friend Merle.\n\nMotley's adventure has him attempting to make his kids proud while acquiring a beehive, a life preserver and a parachute.

{"title_page": "Supercritical water oxidation", "text_new": "{{refimprove|date = May 2008}}\n[[File:Supercritical H2Olr.jpg|thumb|Supercritical Water (Red Area)]]\n\n'''Supercritical water oxidation''' ('''SCWO''') is a process that occurs in [[water]] at [[temperature]]s and [[pressure]]s above a mixture's thermodynamic [[critical point (thermodynamics)|critical point]]. Under these conditions water becomes a fluid with unique properties that can be used to advantage in the destruction of [[hazardous waste]]s such as [[Polychlorinated biphenyl|PCB]]s. The fluid has a [[density]] between that of water [[vapor]] and liquid at standard conditions, and exhibits high [[gas]]-like diffusion rates along with high [[liquid]]-like collision rates. In addition, the behavior of water as a solvent is altered (in comparison to that of subcritical liquid water) - it behaves much less like a polar solvent. As a result, the [[solubility]] behavior is \"reversed\" so that [[chlorinated hydrocarbon]]s become soluble in the water, allowing [[Homogeneous and heterogeneous reactions|single-phase reaction]] of aqueous waste with a dissolved [[oxidizer]]. The reversed solubility also causes [[salt (chemistry)|salt]]s to [[Precipitation (chemistry)|precipitate]] out of solution, meaning they can be treated using conventional methods for solid-waste residuals. Efficient oxidation reactions occur at low temperature (400-650 \u00b0C) with reduced [[NOx]] production.\n\nSCWO can be classified as [[green chemistry]] or as a Clean Technology. The elevated pressures and temperatures required for SCWO are routinely encountered in industrial applications such as petroleum refining and chemical synthesis.\n\nA unique addition to the world of supercritical water (SCW) oxidation is generating high-pressure flames inside the SCW medium. The pioneer works on high-pressure [[Supercritical Water Flames]] were carried out by professor EU Franck at the German University of Karlsruhe in the late 80s. The works were mainly aimed at anticipating conditions which would cause spontaneous generation of non-desirable flames in the flameless SCW oxidation process. These flames would cause instabilities to the system and its components. ETH Zurich pursued the investigation of hydrothermal flames in continuously operated reactors. The rising needs for waste treatment and destruction methods motivated a Japanese Group in the Ebara Corporation to explore SCW flames as an environmental tool. Research on hydrothermal flames has also begun at NASA Glenn Research Center in Cleveland, Ohio.\n[[File:Supercritical Fluids Reactor.jpg|alt=Supercritical Fluids Reactor|thumb|The supercritical fluids reactor (SFR) at Sandia National Laboratories' Combustion Research Facility (CRF), 1995.]]\n[[File:Optical cell.jpg|alt=High-pressure, high-temperature optical cell.|thumb|High-pressure, high-temperature optical cell.]]\n\n== Basic Research ==\nBasic research on supercritical water oxidation was undertaken in the 1990s at Sandia National Laboratory's Combustion Research Facility (CRF), in Livermore, CA. Originally proposed as a hazardous waste destruction technology in response to the Kyoto protocol, multiple waste streams were studied by Steven F. Rice and Russ Hanush, and hydrothermal (supercritical water) flames were investigated by Richard R. Steeper and Jason D. Aiken.

Under these conditions water becomes a fluid with unique properties that can be used to advantage in the destruction of [[hazardous waste]]s such as [[Polychlorinated biphenyl|PCB]]s. The fluid has a [[density]] between that of water [[vapor]] and liquid at standard conditions, and exhibits high [[gas]]-like diffusion rates along with high [[liquid]]-like collision rates. In addition, the behavior of water as a solvent is altered (in comparison to that of subcritical liquid water) - it behaves much less like a polar solvent. As a result, the [[solubility]] behavior is \"reversed\" so that [[chlorinated hydrocarbon]]s become soluble in the water, allowing [[Homogeneous and heterogeneous reactions|single-phase reaction]] of aqueous waste with a dissolved [[oxidizer]]. The reversed solubility also causes [[salt (chemistry)|salt]]s to [[Precipitation (chemistry)|precipitate]] out of solution, meaning they can be treated using conventional methods for solid-waste residuals. Efficient oxidation reactions occur at low temperature (400-650 \u00b0C) with reduced [[NOx]] production.\n\nSCWO can be classified as [[green chemistry]] or as a Clean Technology. The elevated pressures and temperatures required for SCWO are routinely encountered in industrial applications such as petroleum refining and chemical synthesis.\n\nA unique addition to the world of supercritical water (SCW) oxidation is generating high-pressure flames inside the SCW medium. The pioneer works on high-pressure [[Supercritical Water Flames]] were carried out by professor EU Franck at the German University of Karlsruhe in the late 80s. The works were mainly aimed at anticipating conditions which would cause spontaneous generation of non-desirable flames in the flameless SCW oxidation process. These flames would cause instabilities to the system and its components. ETH Zurich pursued the investigation of hydrothermal flames in continuously operated reactors. The rising needs for waste treatment and destruction methods motivated a Japanese Group in the Ebara Corporation to explore SCW flames as an environmental tool. Research on hydrothermal flames has also begun at NASA Glenn Research Center in Cleveland, Ohio.\n[[File:Supercritical Fluids Reactor.jpg|alt=Supercritical Fluids Reactor|thumb|The supercritical fluids reactor (SFR) at Sandia National Laboratories' Combustion Research Facility (CRF), 1995.]]\n[[File:Optical cell.jpg|alt=High-pressure, high-temperature optical cell.|thumb|High-pressure, high-temperature optical cell.]]\n\n== Basic Research ==\nBasic research on supercritical water oxidation was undertaken in the 1990`s at Sandia National Laboratory's Combustion Research Facility (CRF), in Livermore, CA. Originally proposed as a hazardous waste destruction technology in response to the Kyoto protocol, multiple waste streams were studied by Steven F.
