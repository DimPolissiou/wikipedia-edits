However a large number of Greeks and Slavs became Muslims or Turks in order to avert the socioeconomic hardships of Ottoman rule. Conversion to Islam is quick and in the Ottoman Empire there were few documents showing who was or was not Muslim, the only requirements were knowing Turkish, saying you were Muslim and possibly getting circumcised. Greek has a specific word for becoming Muslim called \"\u03c4\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03ba\u03b5\u03cd\u03c9\" and the Slavic languages have tur\u010diti, these practices of fake conversion were common and are a reason so many people in the Balkans have Turkish last names with endings like -oglu. As stated one of the main reason to convert were to avoid paying the [[jizya]] a (~ 20%) tax compared to the [[zakat]] which was a (~ 3%) tax. Another benefit converts received was that they could no longer be discriminated against in court as the Ottoman Empire had 2 separate court systems in which the Islamic court superseded the non-Islamic court and because non-Muslims were not allowed to be present in the Islamic court that basically resulted in an non-Islamic minority losing in court every time. Conversion allowed those to take advantage of greater employment prospects and possibilities of advancement in the Ottoman government bureaucracy and military. Subsequently, these people became part of the Muslim community of the [[millet system]], which was closely linked to [[Islam]]ic religious rules.

Emphasis on Turkish and Muslim identity entails at the same time rejection of any Rumca ethnic identity (Bortone 2009, Ozkan 2013) in relation to Greece, which is still considered an enemy country (Sitaridou 2013). Denial of any links to Greece goes so far that some female respondents from G2 even hesitated to mention the word Rum or Greek. On the one hand, respondents are aware of the Greek origin of Rumca and may even recognize shared cultural elements.

''The Pontic Greek spoken by Muslims''. 2013. p. 137-138. \"Trabzon is well known for its staunch nationalists. Be\u015fk\u00f6y is no exception to this rule. Because of the danger of being perceived as Greeks (''Rum'') clinging to their language and culture, or even worse as Pontians who seek \u2018their lost kingdom of Pontus\u2019 (which is an obscure accusation voiced by Turkish nationalists), it comes as no surprise that MP-speaking people are particularly sensitive to questions of identity. It has to be clarified at this point that the English term \u2018Greek\u2019 is not identical to the Turkish ''Rum'', which means Greek-speaking people of Turkey. Nobody in Be\u015fk\u00f6y would identify themselves as ''Yunan'', which denotes everything Greek coming from Greece (T. ''Yunanistan''). However, as ''Rum'' is perceived in Turkey as linked in some way to Greece or the Orthodox Church, the Greek-speaking Muslims cannot easily present their language as their own, as other minorities in the Black Sea region such as the Laz do. In addition to the reasons stated above, many of the MP-speakers of Be\u015fk\u00f6y strive to be the best Turks and the most pious Muslims. I had no encounter with MP-speakers without the issue of identity being brought up in connection with their language. After a while the MP-speakers themselves would begin to say something on this very sensitive topic. Precisely because of the omnipresence and importance of this issue I cannot leave it uncommented in this introduction. Nevertheless, I did not question people systematically with the use of prepared questionnaires about their identity, their attitude vis-\u00e0-vis the language, i.e. if they like speaking it, if they want to pass it on to their children consciously, if they encountered difficulties because they speak MP, if they consider themselves of Turkish or Greek descent, if they can be Turks and Greeks at the same time, and how they regard Greece and the Pontians who live there. Appropriate answers to these very important sociolinguistic questions can only be found through extensive fieldwork that is endorsed by the Turkish authorities and a dedicated analysis of the data in a sizeable article or even a monograph. Nevertheless, I would like to dwell on some general tendencies that I have observed on the basis of the testimonies of my informants on their attitudes to language and identity. Of course I do not claim that these views are representative of MP-speakers in general, but they reflect the overwhelming impression I had during fieldwork in the region. Therefore I deem it necessary and valuable to give a voice to their opinions here. Many of the MP-speakers I met deny the Greekness of their language, although they know at least that many words in Standard Modern Greek (SMG) are identical to the ones in MP. As a linguist I was often asked to join them in their view in favour of the distinctness of their language. Without telling a lie I tried to reconcile the obvious truth that MP is a Greek dialect with the equally true assertion that MP and SMG are two different languages in the way that Italian and Spanish are distinct languages, to the extent that some characteristics are very similar and others completely different. In most cases they were satisfied with this answer.\"</ref> Grecophone Muslim Pontians when speaking their language refer to it as ''Romeyka'', whereas when conversing in Turkish they call it ''Rumca'' or ''Rumcika''.<ref>Hakan.

In the Ottoman Empire, the primary criterion for the selection of an alphabet in which to write was religion. Thus, people who did not speak\u2014or even know\u2014the official language of their religion used to write their religious texts in the languages that they knew, though in the alphabet where the sacred texts of that religion were written. Thus, the Grecophone Catholics of Chios wrote using the Latin alphabet, but in the Greek language (''[[frangochiotika]]''); the Turcophone Orthodox Christians of Cappadocia wrote their Turkish texts using the Greek alphabet (''[[karamanlidika]]''); and the Grecophone Muslims of the Greek peninsula wrote in Greek language using the Arabic alphabet (''[[tourkogianniotika]]'', ''[[tourkokretika]]'').

The audience for the Greek ''[[Mi'r\u0101jn\u0101ma]]'' was most certainly Greek-speaking Muslims, in particular the so-called ''[[Tourkogianniot]]es'' (literally, the Turks of Jannina). Although few examples have been discovered as yet, it seems that these people developed a religious literature mainly composed in verse form. This literary form constituted the mainstream of Greek ''[[Aljamiado]]'' literature from the middle of the seventeenth century until the [[population exchange between Greece and Turkey]] in 1923. Tourkogianniotes were probably of Christian origin and were Islamized sometime during the seventeenth century. They did not speak any language other than Greek. Thus, even their frequency in attending mosque services did not provide them with the necessary knowledge about their faith. Given their low level of literacy, one important way that they could learn about their faith was to listen to religiously edifying texts such as the Greek ''Mi'r\u0101jn\u0101ma''.}}</ref> The community now is fully integrated into Turkish culture.{{verify source|date=February 2015}} Those Muslims from [[Epirus]] of mainly Albanian rather than Greek convert origin are usually described as [[Cham Albanians]].\n\n==Macedonian Greek Muslims==\nGreek speaking Muslims<ref name = Koukoudis/><ref name = Mackridge/><ref name = Katsikas/><ref>Livanios, Dimitris (2008). \"The Quest for Hellenism: Religion, Nationalism and Collective Identities in Greece (1453\u20131913).\" ''The Historical Review/La Revue Historique''.

The Islamicised Greek-speaking inhabitants of these areas came to be better known as \"Valaades\". They were also called \"Foutsides\", while to the Vlachs of the Grevena area they were also known as \"''Vl\u0103h\u00fatsi''\".

This fact has not yet been adequately investigated. With the growth of national feeling and the spread of education the phenomenon is becoming not only rarer but harder to detect. In a Muslim village the school teacher will be a Turk and will teach the children Turkish. They already think of themselves as Turks, and having once learnt the language, will sometimes use it in talking to a visitor in preference to Greek, merely as matter of national pride. It has been suggested that these Greek-speaking Muslims are descended from Turkish- speaking immigrants who have retained their faith but abandoned their language because of the greater flexibility and commercial usefulness of Greek. It is open to the objection that these villages are situated in the remoter parts of the island, in the western mountains and in the Carpass peninsula, where most of the inhabitants are poor farmers whose commercial dealings are very limited. Moreover, if Greek had gradually replaced Turkish in these villages, one would have expected this to happen in isolated places, where a Turkish settlement is surrounded by Greek villages rather than where there are a number of Turkish villages close together as there are in the Carpass. Yet Ayios Simeon (F I), Ayios Andronikos (F I), and Galinoporni (F I) are all Greek-speaking, while the neighbouring village of Korovia (F I) is Turkish-speaking. It is more likely that these people are descended from Cypriots converted to Islam after 1571, who changed their religion but kept their language. This was the view of Menardos (1905, p. 415) and it is supported by the analogous case of Crete. There it is well known that many Cretans were converted to Islam, and there is ample evidence that Greek was almost the only language spoken by either community in the Cretan villages. Pashley (1837, vol. I, p. 8) \u2018soon found that the whole rural population of Crete understands ''only'' Greek.

She was mother of the next sultan, [[Murad I]]. The traditional stories about her origin, traced back to the 15th century, are that she was daughter of the Byzantine ruler (Tekfur) of [[Bilecik]], called Holofira. As some stories go, Orhan's father [[Osman I|Osman]] raided Bilecik at the time of Holofira's wedding arriving there with rich presents and disguised and hidden soldiers. Holofira was among the loot and given to Orhan.  However modern researchers doubt this story, admitting that it may have been based on real events. Doubts are based on various secondary evidence and lack of direct documentary evidence of the time. In particular, her Ottoman name Nil\u00fcfer meaning water lily in the [[Persian language|Persian]] language.  Other Historians make her a daughter of the Prince of [[Yarhisar]] or a Byzantine Princess Helen (Nil\u00fcfer), who was of ethnic Greek descent. [[Nil\u00fcfer Hatun Imareti]] (Turkish for \"Nil\u00fcfer Hatun Soup Kitchen\"), is a convent annex hospice for dervishes, now housing the [[Iznik Museum]] in [[\u0130znik]], [[Bursa Province]]. When Orhan Gazi was off on campaign Nil\u00fcfer acted as his regent, the only woman in Ottoman history who was ever given such power. During Murad's reign she was recognized as Valide Sultan, or Queen Mother, the first in Ottoman history to hold this title, and when she died she was buried beside Orhan Gazi and his father Osman Gazi in Bursa. The Muslim traveler [[Ibn Battuta]], who visited Iznik in the 1330s, was a guest of Nil\u00fcfer Hatun, whom he described as 'a pious and excellent woman'.\n* [[Nur Felek Kadinefendi]] (1863\u20131914), was the first consort of [[Isma'il Pasha of Egypt]].

She was delivered as a concubine to the harem of [[Sa'id]],the W\u0101li of Egypt in 1852. However, Isma'il Pasha, then not yet the [[Khedive]] of Egypt, took Tatiana as a concubine for him. She gave birth to Prince [[Hussein Kamel Pasha]] in 1853. She later converted to Islam and her name was changed to Nur Felek.

However a large number of Greeks and Slavs became Muslims or Turks in order to avert the socioeconomic hardships of Ottoman rule. Conversion to Islam is quick and in the Ottoman Empire there were few documents showing who was or was not Muslim, the only requirements were knowing Turkish, saying you were Muslim and possibly getting circumcised. Greek has a specific word for becoming Muslim called \"\u03c4\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03ba\u03b5\u03cd\u03c9\" and the Slavic languages have tur\u010diti, these practices of fake conversion were common and are a reason so many people in the Balkans have Turkish last names with endings like -oglu. As stated one of the main reason to convert were to avoid paying the [[jizya]] a (~ 20%) tax compared to the [[zakat]] which was a (~ 3%) tax. Another benefit converts received was that they could no longer be discriminated against in court as the Ottoman Empire had 2 separate court systems in which the Islamic court superseded the non-Islamic court and because non-Muslims were not allowed to be present in the Islamic court that basically resulted in an non-Islamic minority losing in court every time. Conversion allowed those to take advantage of greater employment prospects and possibilities of advancement in the Ottoman government bureaucracy and military. Subsequently, these people became part of the Muslim community of the [[millet system]], which was closely linked to [[Islam]]ic religious rules. At that time people were bound to their millets by their religious affiliations (or their [[confessional community|confessional communities]]), rather than to their ethnic origins.<ref name = \"Ortayli 2006 89-8\">Ortayl\u0131, \u0130lber.

''The Pontic Greek spoken by Muslims''. 2013. p. 137-138. \"Trabzon is well known for its staunch nationalists. Be\u015fk\u00f6y is no exception to this rule. Because of the danger of being perceived as Greeks (''Rum'') clinging to their language and culture, or even worse as Pontians who seek \u2018their lost kingdom of Pontus\u2019 (which is an obscure accusation voiced by Turkish nationalists), it comes as no surprise that MP-speaking people are particularly sensitive to questions of identity. It has to be clarified at this point that the English term \u2018Greek\u2019 is not identical to the Turkish ''Rum'', which means Greek-speaking people of Turkey. Nobody in Be\u015fk\u00f6y would identify themselves as ''Yunan'', which denotes everything Greek coming from Greece (T. ''Yunanistan''). However, as ''Rum'' is perceived in Turkey as linked in some way to Greece or the Orthodox Church, the Greek-speaking Muslims cannot easily present their language as their own, as other minorities in the Black Sea region such as the Laz do. In addition to the reasons stated above, many of the MP-speakers of Be\u015fk\u00f6y strive to be the best Turks and the most pious Muslims. I had no encounter with MP-speakers without the issue of identity being brought up in connection with their language. After a while the MP-speakers themselves would begin to say something on this very sensitive topic. Precisely because of the omnipresence and importance of this issue I cannot leave it uncommented in this introduction. Nevertheless, I did not question people systematically with the use of prepared questionnaires about their identity, their attitude vis-\u00e0-vis the language, i.e. if they like speaking it, if they want to pass it on to their children consciously, if they encountered difficulties because they speak MP, if they consider themselves of Turkish or Greek descent, if they can be Turks and Greeks at the same time, and how they regard Greece and the Pontians who live there. Appropriate answers to these very important sociolinguistic questions can only be found through extensive fieldwork that is endorsed by the Turkish authorities and a dedicated analysis of the data in a sizeable article or even a monograph. Nevertheless, I would like to dwell on some general tendencies that I have observed on the basis of the testimonies of my informants on their attitudes to language and identity. Of course I do not claim that these views are representative of MP-speakers in general, but they reflect the overwhelming impression I had during fieldwork in the region. Therefore I deem it necessary and valuable to give a voice to their opinions here. Many of the MP-speakers I met deny the Greekness of their language, although they know at least that many words in Standard Modern Greek (SMG) are identical to the ones in MP. As a linguist I was often asked to join them in their view in favour of the distinctness of their language. Without telling a lie I tried to reconcile the obvious truth that MP is a Greek dialect with the equally true assertion that MP and SMG are two different languages in the way that Italian and Spanish are distinct languages, to the extent that some characteristics are very similar and others completely different. In most cases they were satisfied with this answer.\"</ref> Grecophone Muslim Pontians when speaking their language refer to it as ''Romeyka'', whereas when conversing in Turkish they call it ''Rumca'' or ''Rumcika''.<ref>Hakan.

Thus, people who did not speak\u2014or even know\u2014the official language of their religion used to write their religious texts in the languages that they knew, though in the alphabet where the sacred texts of that religion were written. Thus, the Grecophone Catholics of Chios wrote using the Latin alphabet, but in the Greek language (''frangochiotika''); the Turcophone Orthodox Christians of Cappadocia wrote their Turkish texts using the Greek alphabet (''karamanlidika''); and the Grecophone Muslims of the Greek peninsula wrote in Greek language using the Arabic alphabet (''tourkogianniotika'', ''tourkokretika'').

This literary form constituted the mainstream of Greek ''[[Aljamiado]]'' literature from the middle of the seventeenth century until the population exchange between Greece and Turkey in 1923. Tourkogianniotes were probably of Christian origin and were Islamized sometime during the seventeenth century. They did not speak any language other than Greek. Thus, even their frequency in attending mosque services did not provide them with the necessary knowledge about their faith.

They were classified as being either Turkish or \"neo-Muslim.\" The latter were of Greek origin, Islamised but speaking Greek, and similar in character to the local Christians. The last of such groups was reported to arrive at [[Antalya]] in 1936. These communities are thought to have abandoned Greek in the course of integration.<ref>Peter Alford Andrews, ''Ethnic Groups in the Republic of Turkey'', Dr. Ludwig Reichert Verlag, 1989, {{ISBN|3-89500-297-6}}</ref> During the 1950s, there were still four Greek speaking Muslim settlements in Cyprus: Lapithou, Platanisso, Ayios Simeon and Galinoporni that identified themselves as Turks.<ref name = Beckingham>Beckingham, Charles Fraser (1957). \"The Turks of Cyprus.\" ''Journal of the Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland''. '''87'''. (2): 170\u2013171. \"While many Turks habitually speak Turkish there are 'Turkish', that is, Muslim villages in which the normal language is Greek; among them are Lapithou, Platanisso, Ayios Simeon and Galinoporni. This fact has not yet been adequately investigated. With the growth of national feeling and the spread of education the phenomenon is becoming not only rarer but harder to detect. In a Muslim village the school teacher will be a Turk and will teach the children Turkish. They already think of themselves as Turks, and having once learnt the language, will sometimes use it in talking to a visitor in preference to Greek, merely as matter of national pride. It has been suggested that these Greek-speaking Muslims are descended from Turkish- speaking immigrants who have retained their faith but abandoned their language because of the greater flexibility and commercial usefulness of Greek. It is open to the objection that these villages are situated in the remoter parts of the island, in the western mountains and in the Carpass peninsula, where most of the inhabitants are poor farmers whose commercial dealings are very limited. Moreover, if Greek had gradually replaced Turkish in these villages, one would have expected this to happen in isolated places, where a Turkish settlement is surrounded by Greek villages rather than where there are a number of Turkish villages close together as there are in the Carpass. Yet Ayios Simeon (F I), Ayios Andronikos (F I), and Galinoporni (F I) are all Greek-speaking, while the neighbouring village of Korovia (F I) is Turkish-speaking. It is more likely that these people are descended from Cypriots converted to Islam after 1571, who changed their religion but kept their language. This was the view of Menardos (1905, p. 415) and it is supported by the analogous case of Crete. There it is well known that many Cretans were converted to Islam, and there is ample evidence that Greek was almost the only language spoken by either community in the Cretan villages. Pashley (1837, vol. I, p. 8) \u2018soon found that the whole rural population of Crete understands ''only'' Greek.

She was mother of the next sultan, [[Murad I]]. The traditional stories about her origin, traced back to the 15th century, are that she was daughter of the Byzantine ruler (Tekfur) of [[Bilecik]], called Holofira. As some stories go, Orhan's father [[Osman I|Osman]] raided Bilecik at the time of Holofira's wedding arriving there with rich presents and disguised and hidden soldiers. Holofira was among the loot and given to Orhan.  However modern researchers doubt this story, admitting that it may have been based on real events. Doubts are based on various secondary evidence and lack of direct documentary evidence of the time. In particular, her Ottoman name Nil\u00fcfer meaning water lily in the [[Persian language|Persian]] language.  Other Historians make her a daughter of the Prince of [[Yarhisar]] or a Byzantine Princess Helen (Nil\u00fcfer), who was of ethnic Greek descent. [[Nil\u00fcfer Hatun Imareti]] (Turkish for \"Nil\u00fcfer Hatun Soup Kitchen\"), is a convent annex hospice for dervishes, now housing the [[Iznik Museum]] in [[\u0130znik]], [[Bursa Province]]. When Orhan Gazi was off on campaign Nil\u00fcfer acted as his regent, the only woman in Ottoman history who was ever given such power. During Murad's reign she was recognized as Valide Sultan, or Queen Mother, the first in Ottoman history to hold this title, and when she died she was buried beside Orhan Gazi and his father Osman Gazi in Bursa. The Muslim traveler [[Ibn Battuta]], who visited Iznik in the 1330s, was a guest of Nil\u00fcfer Hatun, whom he described as 'a pious and excellent woman'.\n* [[Nur Felek Kadinefendi]] (1863\u20131914), was the first consort of [[Isma'il Pasha of Egypt]].

She was delivered as a concubine to the harem of [[Sa'id]],the W\u0101li of Egypt in 1852. However, Isma'il Pasha, then not yet the [[Khedive]] of Egypt, took Tatiana as a concubine for him. She gave birth to Prince [[Hussein Kamel Pasha]] in 1853. She later converted to Islam and her name was changed to Nur Felek.

Four people died and approximately 60 were injured when, during a severe storm, an {{convert|8|ft|adj=on}} ball of fire was described as striking and entering the church, nearly destroying it. Large stones from the church walls were hurled onto the ground and through large wooden beams. The ball of fire allegedly smashed the pews and many windows, and filled the church with a foul sulphurous odour and dark, thick smoke.\n\nThe ball of fire reportedly divided into two segments, one exiting through a window by smashing it open, the other disappearing somewhere inside the church. Because of the fire and sulphur smell, contemporaries explained the ball of fire as \"the devil\" or as the \"flames of hell\". Later, some blamed the entire incident on two people who had been playing cards in the pew during the sermon, thereby incurring God's wrath.<ref name=\"Rowe1905\">{{cite book|title= The Two Widecombe Tracts, 1638[,] giving a Contemporary Account of the great Storm, reprinted with an Introduction|year= 1905|publisher= James G Commin|location= Exeter|url= https://archive.org/details/devonandcornwal02unkngoog|editor= J.

M. Colon, Vice-President of the Geological Society of Paris, saw a ball of lightning descend slowly from the sky along the bark of a poplar tree; as soon as it touched the earth it bounced up again, and disappeared without exploding. On 10th of September 1845 a ball of lightning entered the kitchen of a house in the village of [[Salagnac]] in the valley of [[Correze]]. This ball rolled across without doing any harm to two women and a young man who were here; but on getting into an adjoining stable it exploded and killed a pig which happened to be shut up there, and which, knowing nothing about the wonders of thunder and lightning, dared to smell it in the most rude and unbecoming manner.\n\nThe motion of such balls is far from being very rapid&nbsp;\u2013 they have even been observed occasionally to pause in their course, but they are not the less destructive for all that. A ball of lightning which entered the church of Stralsund, on exploding, projected a number of balls which exploded in their turn like shells.<ref>{{cite news |title= Globular lightning|last= Anon|date= 24 December 1867|work= The Leeds Mercury|location= Leeds, UK}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n=== Tsar Nicholas II ===\n[[Tsar Nicholas II]], the last Emperor of Russia, reported witnessing what he called \"a fiery ball\" while in the company of his grandfather, Emperor [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]]: <blockquote>Once my parents were away, and I was at the [[all-night vigil]] with my grandfather in the small church in [[Alexander Palace|Alexandria]]. During the service there was a powerful thunderstorm, streaks of lightning flashed one after the other, and it seemed as if the peals of thunder would shake even the church and the whole world to its foundations.

Microwaves trapped inside the ball continue to generate plasma for a moments to maintain the bright flashes described observer accounts. The ball eventually fades as the radiation held within the bubble starts to decay and microwaves are discharged from the sphere. The lightning balls can dramatically explode as the structure destabilizes. The theory could explain many of the strange characteristics of ball lightning. For instance, microwaves are able to pass through glass, which helps to explain why balls could be formed indoors.\n\n=== Soliton hypothesis ===\n{{Main|Soliton|St. Elmo's fire}}\n\nJulio Rubinstein,<ref>{{cite web|title=Rubinstein, J|url=http://inspirehep.net/author/profile/J.Rubinstein.1|website=Inspire HEP|accessdate=6 March 2017}}</ref> [[David Finkelstein]], and James R. Powell proposed that ball lightning is a detached St. Elmo's fire (1964\u20131970).{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} St. Elmo's fire arises when a sharp conductor, such as a ship's mast, amplifies the atmospheric electric field to breakdown. For a globe the amplification factor is 3. A free ball of ionized{{explanation needed|date=March 2019}} air can amplify the ambient field this much by its own conductivity. When this maintains the ionization, the ball is then a [[soliton]] in the flow of atmospheric electricity.\n\nPowell's kinetic theory calculation found that the ball size is set by the second Townsend coefficient (the mean free path of conduction electrons) near breakdown. Wandering glow discharges are found to occur within certain industrial microwave ovens and continue to glow for several seconds after power is shut off. [[electric arc|Arcs]] drawn from high-power low-voltage microwave generators also are found to exhibit afterglow. Powell measured their spectra, and found that the after-glow comes mostly from metastable [[nitric oxide|NO]] ions, which are long-lived at low temperatures. It occurred in air and in nitrous oxide, which possess such metastable ions, and not in atmospheres of argon, carbon dioxide, or helium, which do not.\n\nThe soliton model of a ball lightning was further developed.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title = Electron gas oscillations in plasma.

Around the ring, over and under pressure systems rotate the vortex around a circular axis in the cross section of the torus. At the same time, the ring expands concentrically parallel to the ground at low speed.\n\nIn an open space, the vortex fades and finally disappears. If the vortex's expansion is obstructed, and symmetry is broken, the vortex breaks into cyclical form. Still invisible, and due to the central and surface tension-forces, it shrinks to an intermediate state of a cylinder, and finally into a ball. The resulting transformation subsequently becomes visible once the energy is concentrated into the final spherical stage.\n\nThe ball lightning has the same rotational axis as the rotating cylinder. As the vortex has a much smaller vector of energy compared to the overall energy of the reactant sonic shock wave, its vector is likely fractional to the overall reaction. The vortex, during contraction, gives the majority of its energy to form the ball lightning, achieving nominal energy loss.\n\nIn some observations, the ball lightning appeared to have an extremely high energy concentration<ref name=\"bare_url\" /> but this phenomenon hasn't been adequately verified. The present theory concerns only the low energy lightning ball form, with centripetal forces and surface tension. The visibility of the ball lightning can be associated with electroluminescence, a direct result of the triboelectric effect from materials within the area of the reaction. Static discharge from the cylindrical stage imply the existence of contact electrification within the object. The direction of the discharges indicate the cylinder's rotation, and resulting rotational axis of the ball lightning in accordance to the law of laminar flow. If the ball came from the channel, it would have rotated in the opposite direction.\n\nOne theory that may account for the wide spectrum of observational evidence is the idea of [[combustion]] inside the low-velocity region of spherical [[vortex]] breakdown of a natural vortex{{vague|date=July 2012}} (e.g., the '[[Hill's spherical vortex]]').<ref>{{cite journal | last = Coleman | first = PF | year = 1993 | journal = Weather | volume = 48 | issue = 1 | page = 30 | title = An explanation for ball lightning? | doi = 10.1002/j.1477-8696.1993.tb07221.x|bibcode = 1993Wthr...48...27. }}</ref>\n\n=== Nanobattery hypothesis ===\nOleg Meshcheryakov suggests that ball lightning is made of composite nano or submicrometre particles\u2014each particle constituting a [[Battery (electrical)|battery]].

Meessen presented a theory at the 10th International Symposium on Ball Lightning (June 21\u201327, 2010, Kaliningrad, Russia) explaining all known properties of ball lightning in terms of collective oscillations of free electrons. The simplest case corresponds to radial oscillations in a spherical plasma membrane. These oscillations are sustained by parametric amplification, resulting from regular \"inhalation\" of charged particles that are present at lower densities in the ambient air. Ball lightning vanishes thus by silent extinction when the available density of charged particles is too low, while it disappears with a loud and sometimes very violent explosion when this density is too high. Electronic oscillations are also possible as stationary waves in a plasma ball or thick plasma membrane. This yields concentric luminous bubbles.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.meessen.net/AMeessen/Ball-Lightning-Theory.pdf|title=Ball Lightning: Bubbles of Electronic Plasma Oscillations|publisher=Journal of Unconventional Electromagnetics and Plasmas|last1 = Meessen| first1 = A. |volume= 4 | pages = 163\u2013179 | year=2012}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{col-begin|width=40%}}{{col-break}}\n* [[Atmospheric ghost lights]]\n* [[Brown Mountain Lights]]\n* [[Earthquake light]]\n* [[Hitodama]]\n* [[Marfa lights]]\n{{col-break}}\n* [[Naga fireball]]\n* [[Spontaneous human combustion]]\n* [[Sprite (lightning)]]\n* [[Will-o'-the-wisp]]\n{{col-end}}\n\n== References ==\n'''Notes'''\n{{reflist}}\n\n'''Further reading'''\n* {{cite book|last=Barry|first=James Dale|title=Ball Lightning and Bead Lightning|location=New York|publisher=Plenum Press|year=1980|isbn=978-0-306-40272-2}}\n* {{cite book|last1=Cade|first1=Cecil Maxwell|author2=Delphine Davis|title=The Taming of the Thunderbolts|location=New York|publisher=Abelard-Schuman Limited|year=1969|isbn=978-0-200-71531-7}}\n* {{cite book|last=Coleman|first=Peter F.|title=Great Balls of Fire\u2014A Unified Theory of Ball Lightning, UFOs, Tunguska and other Anomalous Lights|location=Christchurch, NZ|publisher=Fireshine Press|year=2004|isbn=978-1-4116-1276-1}}\n* Coleman, P.F. 2006, J.Sci.Expl., Vol. 20, No.2, 215\u2013238.\n* {{cite book|last=Golde|first=R.

This ball rolled across without doing any harm to two women and a young man who were here; but on getting into an adjoining stable it exploded and killed a pig which happened to be shut up there, and which, knowing nothing about the wonders of thunder and lightning, dared to smell it in the most rude and unbecoming manner.\n\nThe motion of such balls is far from being very rapid&nbsp;\u2013 they have even been observed occasionally to pause in their course, but they are not the less destructive for all that.

As it cools, the silicon could condense into a floating aerosol, bound by its charge, glowing due to the heat of silicon recombining with [[oxygen]]. An experimental investigation of this effect, published in 2007, reported producing \"luminous balls with lifetime in the order of seconds\" by evaporating pure silicon with an electric arc.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Paiva |first1=Gerson Silva |author2=Antonio Carlos Pav\u00e3o |author3=Elder Alpes de Vasconcelos |author4=Odim Mendes, Jr. |author5=Eronides Felisberto da Silva, Jr. |year= 2007|title= Production of Ball-Lightning-Like Luminous Balls by Electrical Discharges in Silicon|journal=Phys.

Microwaves trapped inside the ball continue to generate plasma for a moments to maintain the bright flashes described observer accounts. The ball eventually fades as the radiation held within the bubble starts to decay and microwaves are discharged from the sphere. The lightning balls can dramatically explode as the structure destabilizes. The theory could explain many of the strange characteristics of ball lightning. For instance, microwaves are able to pass through glass, which helps to explain why balls could be formed indoors.\n\n=== Soliton hypothesis ===\n{{Main|Soliton|St. Elmo's fire}}\n\nJulio Rubinstein,<ref>{{cite web|title=Rubinstein, J|url=http://inspirehep.net/author/profile/J.Rubinstein.1|website=Inspire HEP|accessdate=6 March 2017}}</ref> [[David Finkelstein]], and James R. Powell proposed that ball lightning is a detached St. Elmo's fire (1964\u20131970).{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} St. Elmo's fire arises when a sharp conductor, such as a ship's mast, amplifies the atmospheric electric field to breakdown. For a globe the amplification factor is 3. A free ball of ionized{{explanation needed|date=March 2019}} air can amplify the ambient field this much by its own conductivity. When this maintains the ionization, the ball is then a [[soliton]] in the flow of atmospheric electricity.\n\nPowell's kinetic theory calculation found that the ball size is set by the second Townsend coefficient (the mean free path of conduction electrons) near breakdown. Wandering glow discharges are found to occur within certain industrial microwave ovens and continue to glow for several seconds after power is shut off. [[electric arc|Arcs]] drawn from high-power low-voltage microwave generators also are found to exhibit afterglow. Powell measured their spectra, and found that the after-glow comes mostly from metastable [[nitric oxide|NO]] ions, which are long-lived at low temperatures. It occurred in air and in nitrous oxide, which possess such metastable ions, and not in atmospheres of argon, carbon dioxide, or helium, which do not.\n\nThe soliton model of a ball lightning was further developed.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title = Electron gas oscillations in plasma.

Around the ring, over and under pressure systems rotate the vortex around a circular axis in the cross section of the torus. At the same time, the ring expands concentrically parallel to the ground at low speed.\n\nIn an open space, the vortex fades and finally disappears. If the vortex's expansion is obstructed, and symmetry is broken, the vortex breaks into cyclical form. Still invisible, and due to the central and surface tension-forces, it shrinks to an intermediate state of a cylinder, and finally into a ball. The resulting transformation subsequently becomes visible once the energy is concentrated into the final spherical stage.\n\nThe ball lightning has the same rotational axis as the rotating cylinder. As the vortex has a much smaller vector of energy compared to the overall energy of the reactant sonic shock wave, its vector is likely fractional to the overall reaction. The vortex, during contraction, gives the majority of its energy to form the ball lightning, achieving nominal energy loss.\n\nIn some observations, the ball lightning appeared to have an extremely high energy concentration<ref name=\"bare_url\" /> but this phenomenon hasn't been adequately verified. The present theory concerns only the low energy lightning ball form, with centripetal forces and surface tension. The visibility of the ball lightning can be associated with electroluminescence, a direct result of the triboelectric effect from materials within the area of the reaction. Static discharge from the cylindrical stage imply the existence of contact electrification within the object. The direction of the discharges indicate the cylinder's rotation, and resulting rotational axis of the ball lightning in accordance to the law of laminar flow. If the ball came from the channel, it would have rotated in the opposite direction.\n\nOne theory that may account for the wide spectrum of observational evidence is the idea of [[combustion]] inside the low-velocity region of spherical [[vortex]] breakdown of a natural vortex{{vague|date=July 2012}} (e.g., the '[[Hill's spherical vortex]]').<ref>{{cite journal | last = Coleman | first = PF | year = 1993 | journal = Weather | volume = 48 | issue = 1 | page = 30 | title = An explanation for ball lightning? | doi = 10.1002/j.1477-8696.1993.tb07221.x|bibcode = 1993Wthr...48...27. }}</ref>\n\n=== Nanobattery hypothesis ===\nOleg Meshcheryakov suggests that ball lightning is made of composite nano or submicrometre particles\u2014each particle constituting a [[Battery (electrical)|battery]].

Meessen presented a theory at the 10th International Symposium on Ball Lightning (June 21\u201327, 2010, Kaliningrad, Russia) explaining all known properties of ball lightning in terms of collective oscillations of free electrons. The simplest case corresponds to radial oscillations in a spherical plasma membrane. These oscillations are sustained by parametric amplification, resulting from regular \"inhalation\" of charged particles that are present at lower densities in the ambient air. Ball lightning vanishes thus by silent extinction when the available density of charged particles is too low, while it disappears with a loud and sometimes very violent explosion when this density is too high. Electronic oscillations are also possible as stationary waves in a plasma ball or thick plasma membrane. This yields concentric luminous bubbles.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.meessen.net/AMeessen/Ball-Lightning-Theory.pdf|title=Ball Lightning: Bubbles of Electronic Plasma Oscillations|publisher=Journal of Unconventional Electromagnetics and Plasmas|last1 = Meessen| first1 = A. |volume= 4 | pages = 163\u2013179 | year=2012}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{col-begin|width=40%}}{{col-break}}\n* [[Atmospheric ghost lights]]\n* [[Brown Mountain Lights]]\n* [[Earthquake light]]\n* [[Hitodama]]\n* [[Marfa lights]]\n{{col-break}}\n* [[Naga fireball]]\n* [[Spontaneous human combustion]]\n* [[Sprite (lightning)]]\n* [[Will-o'-the-wisp]]\n{{col-end}}\n\n== References ==\n'''Notes'''\n{{reflist}}\n\n'''Further reading'''\n* {{cite book|last=Barry|first=James Dale|title=Ball Lightning and Bead Lightning|location=New York|publisher=Plenum Press|year=1980|isbn=978-0-306-40272-2}}\n* {{cite book|last1=Cade|first1=Cecil Maxwell|author2=Delphine Davis|title=The Taming of the Thunderbolts|location=New York|publisher=Abelard-Schuman Limited|year=1969|isbn=978-0-200-71531-7}}\n* {{cite book|last=Coleman|first=Peter F.|title=Great Balls of Fire\u2014A Unified Theory of Ball Lightning, UFOs, Tunguska and other Anomalous Lights|location=Christchurch, NZ|publisher=Fireshine Press|year=2004|isbn=978-1-4116-1276-1}}\n* Coleman, P.F. 2006, J.Sci.Expl., Vol. 20, No.2, 215\u2013238.\n* {{cite book|last=Golde|first=R.

[[Freedom of religion]] is inscribed in the [[constitution of the Republic of China|constitution of the Republic of China (Taiwan)]].\n\nMany statistical analyses try to distinguish between Buddhism and Taoism in Taiwan, which, along with [[Confucianism]], are rather aspects within broader \"ancient Chinese religion\". It is hard to make such distinction because various Taoist deities are worshipped alongside deities which originated in Buddhism, for instance [[Guanyin]], in many temples across the country.\n\n==History==\nPrior to the 17th century the [[geography of Taiwan|island of Taiwan]] was inhabited by the [[Taiwanese aborigines]] of [[Austronesian peoples|Austronesian stock]], and there were small settlements of [[China|Chinese]] and [[Japan]]ese maritime traders and pirates.{{sfnp|Clart|Jones|2003|p=11}} Taiwanese aborigines traditionally practised an [[animism|animistic]] [[ethnic religion]]. When the island fell under [[Dutch Formosa|Dutch rule]] in 1624, [[Protestantism]] was spread to the Taiwanese aborigines. Two years later, with the transition to [[Spanish Formosa|Spanish rule]], the [[Catholic Church]] was introduced into the island.\n\nWhen the [[Han Chinese]] began to settle the island and form the [[Taiwanese people|Taiwanese Chinese ethnic group]], exchanges between the indigenous religion of the Austronesian aborigines and the [[Chinese folk religion]] occurred.{{sfnp|Rubinstein|2014|p=347}} For instance, [[Ali-zu]], the [[Siraya people|Siraya]] god of fertility, has been incorporated into the Han pantheon in some places of Taiwan.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Shepherd|first=John

began in the 1660s with the transition of imperial power from the [[Ming dynasty]] to the [[Manchu people|Manchurian]] [[Qing dynasty]].{{sfnp|Clart|Jones|2003|p=12}} Many Ming loyalists fled to the south, including Zheng Chenggong alias [[Koxinga]], a military warlord who fought against the Manchu dynasty.{{sfnp|Clart|Jones|2003|p=12}} He sailed to Taiwan in 1661 with thousands of troops, and in a was with the [[Netherlands|Dutch]], he defeated and drove out the Dutch military forces and established the [[Kingdom of Tungning]], the first Chinese state on the island.{{sfnp|Clart|Jones|2003|p=12}} Chinese settlers, mostly from [[Fujian]] and [[Guangdong]], began to migrate to the island.{{sfnp|Clart|Jones|2003|p=12}} The policy of migration to Taiwan was restrictive until 1788, even after the island came under the political control of the Qing in 1683.{{sfnp|Clart|Jones|2003|p=12}}\n\nChinese migrants brought with them the [[Chinese folk religion|ancient Chinese religion]] from the mainland, which served to integrate communities around the worship of ancient Chinese gods.{{sfnp|Clart|Jones|2003|p=12}} As the settlers were mostly males, came from different areas, and at first not many people shared the same [[Chinese surname|surnames]] and belonged to the same [[Chinese kin|kins]], [[ancestral shrines]] of [[ancestor veneration in China|kinship gods]] did not develop until the 1790s, when sufficient generations of families had established on the island.{{sfnp|Clart|Jones|2003|p=13-14}}\n\nThe first settlers in Koxinga and Qing periods brought with them images or incense ashes from mainland temples, installed them in homes or temporary thatched huts, and later in proper temples, as economic circumstances permitted to build them.{{sfnp|Clart|Jones|2003|p=15}} Prominent temples became the foci of religious, political and social life, often eclipsing Qing officials and state-sponsored temples in their influence.{{sfnp|Clart|Jones|2003|p=15}}\n\nThere is little evidence that the doctrinal and initiatory religions of [[Buddhism]] and [[Taoism]] were active during this period.{{sfnp|Clart|Jones|2003|p=15}} Taiwan, as a frontier land, was not attractive for Buddhist and Taoist religious leaders.{{sfnp|Clart|Jones|2003|p=15}}\n\n===19th century===\nDuring the mid-[[Qing dynasty]], sects of popular [[Buddhism]] which the Japanese authorities would have later lumped together with the [[Chinese religions of fasting|religions of fasting]] (''zh\u0101iji\u0101o'') because of their vegetarian precepts, began to send missionaries from the mainland to Taiwan.{{sfnp|Clart|Jones|2003|p=16}} They were more successful in attracting converts than either pure Buddhism or Taoism.{{sfnp|Clart|Jones|2003|p=16}} Japanese researches of the early colonial period identified ''zhaijiao'' sects as a line of the [[Linji school]] of [[Chan Buddhism]], although contemporary scholars know that they were centered on a female creator deity, [[Wusheng Laomu]], and identify them as branches of [[Luoism]] disguising as a form of Buddhism free of ordained clergy.{{sfnp|Clart|Jones|2003|p=16}} ''Zhaijiao'' sects identify the ''[[sangha (Buddhism)|sangha]]'' as the community of believers, not as a separate clergy.{{sfnp|Clart|Jones|2003|p=17}}\n\nApart from ''zhaijiao'' Buddhist sects, other [[Chinese salvationist religions|folk religious sects]], that were mistakenly classified as Buddhist by the Japanese government, were active in Taiwan.{{sfnp|Clart|Jones|2003|p=18}} The most prominent were the three [[Chinese religions of fasting|religions of fasting]]: the Jinchuang, the Longhua, and [[Xiantiandao]] traditions (the latter was introduced to Taiwan in the mid-19th century).{{sfnp|Clart|Jones|2003|p=18}}\n\n===20th century\u2014Japanese rule===\n[[File:Prince Hirohito visit to Tainan

Japan]] as part of the terms of surrender following the [[First Sino-Japanese War]].{{sfnp|Clart|Jones|2003|p=18}} During the fifty-one years of [[Taiwan under Japanese rule|Japanese rule]], governors enacted regulations to control the activities of \"native religions\".{{sfnp|Clart|Jones|2003|p=19}} During a first period from 1895 to 1915, the Japanese adopted a ''laissez-faire'' policy towards native religions.{{sfnp|Clart|Jones|2003|p=19}} During a second phase from 1915 to 1937, the government tried to vigorously regulate local religions.{{sfnp|Clart|Jones|2003|p=19}} A third period, coinciding with the outbreak of hostilities between Japan and mainland China, saw the Japanese government start a {{nihongo|\"[[Japanisation]] movement\"|\u7687\u6c11\u5316\u904b\u52d5|k\u014dminka

shared heritage of China and Japan, received better treatment than [[Chinese folk religion]] and [[Taoism]].{{sfnp|Clart|Jones|2003|p=20}} Some Taiwanese Buddhist groups cooperated with the Japanese government, and [[Buddhism in Japan|Japanese Buddhist]] sects sent missionaries to Taiwan and even worked with ''zhaijiao'' Buddhist groups.{{sfnp|Clart|Jones|2003|pp=20\u201321}} However, given the profound differences between Chinese and Japanese Buddhist traditions (among others, Japanese priests marry, eat meat and drink wine, all of which Chinese monks abstain from), the \"Japanisation\" of [[Chinese Buddhism]] was resisted by Taiwanese Buddhist communities.{{sfnp|Clart|Jones|2003|p=21}}\n\nIn 1915, Japanese religious policies in Taiwan changed after the \"[[Tapani incident|Xilai Hermitage incident]]\".{{sfnp|Clart|Jones|2003|p=21}} The hermitage was a ''zhaijiao'' Buddhist hall where the follower Yu Qingfang (\u4f59\u6e05\u82b3) started an anti-Japanese uprising, in which many other [[Chinese salvationist religions|folk religious]] and [[Taoism|Taoist]] sects took part.{{sfnp|Clart|Jones|2003|p=21}} The Japanese government discovered the plot and Yu Qingfang was executed in a speedy trial together with ninety-four other followers.{{sfnp|Clart|Jones|2003|p=21}}\n\nAfter the incident, the Japanese government became suspicious of what it called Taiwan's {{nihongo4|\"old religious customs\"||ky\u016bkan sh\u016bky\u014d}}.{{sfnp|Clart|Jones|2003|p=21}} The government began to investigate, register and regulate local temples, and it created islandwide Buddhist religious associations\u2014into which even ''zhaijiao'' Buddhist groups were enrolled\u2014whose charters recommended loyalty to the government.{{sfnp|Clart|Jones|2003|pp=21\u201323}}\n\nIn 1937, after the [[Marco Polo Bridge Incident]] and the start of the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], [[Tokyo]] ordered the rapid acculturation of the peoples of Japan's colonies.{{sfnp|Clart|Jones|2003|p=24}} This included an effort to disaccustom people from Chinese traditional religions and convert them into the nexus of [[State Shinto]].{{sfnp|Clart|Jones|2003|p=24}} Many [[Shinto shrine]]s were [[Shinto in Taiwan|established in Taiwan]]. Chinese family altars were replaced with ''[[kamidana]]'' and ''[[butsudan]]'', and a Japanese calendar of religious festivals was introduced.{{sfnp|Clart|Jones|2003|p=24}}\n\nThe subsequent \"temples' restructuration movement\" caused much consternation among the Chinese population and had far-reaching effects.{{sfnp|Clart|Jones|2003|p=25}} Its inception can be traced back to the \"Conference for Improving Popular Customs\" held in 1936, that far from promoting a razing of temples discussed measures for a reform and standardisation of Taoist and folk temple practices.{{sfnp|Clart|Jones|2003|p=24}}\n\nThe outbreak of open war between China and Japan in 1937 led to a proscription of practices and even stronger measures, as Japanese officials saw the religious culture centered around folk temples as the major obstacle to Japanisation.{{sfnp|Clart|Jones|2003|p=25}} Consequently, some local officials began to close and to demolish temples, burning their images, confiscating their cash and real estates, a measure that they called \"sending the gods to Heaven\".{{sfnp|Clart|Jones|2003|p=25}} In 1940, when a new governor-general took office, the \"temples' restructuration movement\" was halted.{{sfnp|Clart|Jones|2003|p=26}}\n\nThe Japanese persecution of Chinese folk religion led to an increase in skepticism and loss of faith among the Chinese.{{sfnp|Clart|Jones|2003|p=27}} As a result of this loss of faith in gods, Japanese police reported a general decline in public morals.{{sfnp|Clart|Jones|2003|p=27}} The policies also resulted in the disappearance of the small [[Muslim]] community, until [[Islam]] was reintroduced by the [[Kuomintang]] with their retreat from mainland China to Taiwan after the end of [[Chinese Civil War]] in 1949.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Gowing|first=Peter G.|title=Islam in Taiwan|journal=Saudi Aramco World|volume=21|number=4|date=July\u2013August 1970|url=http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/197004/islam.in.taiwan.htm}}</ref>\n\nAnother effect of the Japanese colonisation on religious life in Taiwan was due to the modernisation of infrastructures.{{sfnp|Clart|Jones|2003|p=29}} Before the 20th century the travel infrastructure of Taiwan was not very developed, and it was difficult for people to move from a part of the island to another.{{sfnp|Clart|Jones|2003|p=29}} The Japanese quickly constructed a network of railroads connecting all regions of the island.{{sfnp|Clart|Jones|2003|p=29}} In the field of religion, this promoted the rise in importance of some Buddhist, Taoist or folk temples as island-wide pilgrimage sites.{{sfnp|Clart|Jones|2003|p=29}} During this time, some gods lost their local and sub-ethnic nature and became \"pan-Taiwanese\".{{sfnp|Clart|Jones|2003|pp=29\u201331}}\n\n===1945 onwards\u2014Republic of China rule===\n[[File:Tian Yuan Gong.jpg|thumb|upright|200px|''Tianyuanggong'', a temple of [[Yiguandao]] in Tamsui, New Taipei.]]\n\nIn 1945, after the [[Second World War]], the administration of Taiwan was handed over to the [[Republic of China (1912\u201349)|Republic of China]] through [[General Order No. 1]]. The [[People's Republic of China]] was established four years later in [[mainland China]] under the [[Communist Party of China]].\n\nThe rapid [[economic growth]] of Taiwan since the 1970s and 1980s (\"[[Taiwan Miracle]]\") accompanied by a quick renewal of [[Chinese folk religion]], challenging [[Max Weber]]'s theories on [[secularisation]] and [[disenchantment]], has led many scholars to investigate how folk religious culture, with its emphasis on values like loyalty, its social network of temples and gods' societies, may have contributed to the island's economic development.{{sfnp|Rubinstein|2014|p=351}} During the same period, folk religions developed ties with [[environmentalism|environmental causes]].{{sfnp|Rubinstein|2014|p=355}} [[Chinese salvationist religions]] (such as earlier [[Xiantiandao]]) become increasingly popular in Taiwan after 1945, although some of them were illegal until the 1980s.{{sfnp|Rubinstein|2014|p=346}}\n\nAfter the 1950s, and especially since the 1970s, there was a significant growth of [[Buddhism]].{{sfnp|Rubinstein|2014|p=356}} [[Chinese Buddhism]] developed into distinctively [[Buddhist modernism|new forms]] with the foundation of movements like the [[Tzu Chi]], the [[Fo Guang Shan]] and the [[Dharma Drum Mountain]], which follow the philosophy of [[Humanistic Buddhism]] elaborated in China in the early 20th century.{{sfnp|Rubinstein|2014|p=357}} [[Tibetan Buddhism]] too was spread to the island.{{sfnp|Rubinstein|2014|p=357}} Since the 2000s there was an increasing cooperation between religious groups in Taiwan and mainland [[China]].{{sfnp|Rubinstein|2014|p=360}}{{sfnp|Brown|Cheng|2012|loc=''passim''}}\n\n==Religions==\n\n===Main religions===\n\n====Chinese folk religion====\n{{Main|Chinese folk religion}}\nChinese traditional, popular or folk religion, or simply Chinese religion, also called Shenism, defines the collection of [[grassroots]] [[ethnic religion|ethnic religious]] and spiritual experiences, disciplines, beliefs and practices of the [[Han Chinese]].

[[Freedom of religion]] is inscribed in the [[constitution of the Republic of China|constitution of the Republic of China (Taiwan)]].\n\nMany statistical analyses try to distinguish between Buddhism and Taoism in Taiwan, which, along with [[Confucianism]], are rather aspects within broader \"ancient Chinese religion\". It is hard to make such distinction because various Taoist deities are worshipped alongside deities which originated in Buddhism, for instance [[Guanyin]], in many temples across the country.\n\n==History==\nPrior to the 17th century the [[geography of Taiwan|island of Taiwan]] was inhabited by the [[Taiwanese aborigines]] of [[Austronesian peoples|Austronesian stock]], and there were small settlements of [[China|Chinese]] and [[Japan]]ese maritime traders and pirates.{{sfnp|Clart|Jones|2003|p=11}} Taiwanese aborigines traditionally practised an [[animism|animistic]] [[ethnic religion]]. When the island fell under [[Dutch Formosa|Dutch rule]] in 1624, [[Protestantism]] was spread to the Taiwanese aborigines. Two years later, with the transition to [[Spanish Formosa|Spanish rule]], the [[Catholic Church]] was introduced into the island.\n\nWhen the [[Han Chinese]] began to settle the island and form the [[Taiwanese people|Taiwanese Chinese ethnic group]], exchanges between the indigenous religion of the Austronesian aborigines and the [[Chinese folk religion]] occurred.{{sfnp|Rubinstein|2014|p=347}} For instance, [[Ali-zu]], the [[Siraya people|Siraya]] god of fertility, has been incorporated into the Han pantheon in some places of Taiwan.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Shepherd|first=John

began in the 1660s with the transition of imperial power from the [[Ming dynasty]] to the [[Manchu people|Manchurian]] [[Qing dynasty]].{{sfnp|Clart|Jones|2003|p=12}} Many Ming loyalists fled to the south, including Zheng Chenggong alias [[Koxinga]], a military warlord who fought against the Manchu dynasty.{{sfnp|Clart|Jones|2003|p=12}} He sailed to Taiwan in 1661 with thousands of troops, and in a was with the [[Netherlands|Dutch]], he defeated and drove out the Dutch military forces and established the [[Kingdom of Tungning]], the first Chinese state on the island.{{sfnp|Clart|Jones|2003|p=12}} Chinese settlers, mostly from [[Fujian]] and [[Guangdong]], began to migrate to the island.{{sfnp|Clart|Jones|2003|p=12}} The policy of migration to Taiwan was restrictive until 1788, even after the island came under the political control of the Qing in 1683.{{sfnp|Clart|Jones|2003|p=12}}\n\nChinese migrants brought with them the [[Chinese folk religion|ancient Chinese religion]] from the mainland, which served to integrate communities around the worship of ancient Chinese gods.{{sfnp|Clart|Jones|2003|p=12}} As the settlers were mostly males, came from different areas, and at first not many people shared the same [[Chinese surname|surnames]] and belonged to the same [[Chinese kin|kins]], [[ancestral shrines]] of [[ancestor veneration in China|kinship gods]] did not develop until the 1790s, when sufficient generations of families had established on the island.{{sfnp|Clart|Jones|2003|p=13-14}}\n\nThe first settlers in Koxinga and Qing periods brought with them images or incense ashes from mainland temples, installed them in homes or temporary thatched huts, and later in proper temples, as economic circumstances permitted to build them.{{sfnp|Clart|Jones|2003|p=15}} Prominent temples became the foci of religious, political and social life, often eclipsing Qing officials and state-sponsored temples in their influence.{{sfnp|Clart|Jones|2003|p=15}}\n\nThere is little evidence that the doctrinal and initiatory religions of [[Buddhism]] and [[Taoism]] were active during this period.{{sfnp|Clart|Jones|2003|p=15}} Taiwan, as a frontier land, was not attractive for Buddhist and Taoist religious leaders.{{sfnp|Clart|Jones|2003|p=15}}\n\n===19th century===\nDuring the mid-[[Qing dynasty]], sects of popular [[Buddhism]] which the Japanese authorities would have later lumped together with the [[Chinese religions of fasting|religions of fasting]] (''zh\u0101iji\u0101o'') because of their vegetarian precepts, began to send missionaries from the mainland to Taiwan.{{sfnp|Clart|Jones|2003|p=16}} They were more successful in attracting converts than either pure Buddhism or Taoism.{{sfnp|Clart|Jones|2003|p=16}} Japanese researches of the early colonial period identified ''zhaijiao'' sects as a line of the [[Linji school]] of [[Chan Buddhism]], although contemporary scholars know that they were centered on a female creator deity, [[Wusheng Laomu]], and identify them as branches of [[Luoism]] disguising as a form of Buddhism free of ordained clergy.{{sfnp|Clart|Jones|2003|p=16}} ''Zhaijiao'' sects identify the ''[[sangha (Buddhism)|sangha]]'' as the community of believers, not as a separate clergy.{{sfnp|Clart|Jones|2003|p=17}}\n\nApart from ''zhaijiao'' Buddhist sects, other [[Chinese salvationist religions|folk religious sects]], that were mistakenly classified as Buddhist by the Japanese government, were active in Taiwan.{{sfnp|Clart|Jones|2003|p=18}} The most prominent were the three [[Chinese religions of fasting|religions of fasting]]: the Jinchuang, the Longhua, and [[Xiantiandao]] traditions (the latter was introduced to Taiwan in the mid-19th century).{{sfnp|Clart|Jones|2003|p=18}}\n\n===20th century\u2014Japanese rule===\n[[File:Prince Hirohito visit to Tainan

Japan]] as part of the terms of surrender following the [[First Sino-Japanese War]].{{sfnp|Clart|Jones|2003|p=18}} During the fifty-one years of [[Taiwan under Japanese rule|Japanese rule]], governors enacted regulations to control the activities of \"native religions\".{{sfnp|Clart|Jones|2003|p=19}} During a first period from 1895 to 1915, the Japanese adopted a ''laissez-faire'' policy towards native religions.{{sfnp|Clart|Jones|2003|p=19}} During a second phase from 1915 to 1937, the government tried to vigorously regulate local religions.{{sfnp|Clart|Jones|2003|p=19}} A third period, coinciding with the outbreak of hostilities between Japan and mainland China, saw the Japanese government start a {{nihongo|\"[[Japanisation]] movement\"|\u7687\u6c11\u5316\u904b\u52d5|k\u014dminka

shared heritage of China and Japan, received better treatment than [[Chinese folk religion]] and [[Taoism]].{{sfnp|Clart|Jones|2003|p=20}} Some Taiwanese Buddhist groups cooperated with the Japanese government, and [[Buddhism in Japan|Japanese Buddhist]] sects sent missionaries to Taiwan and even worked with ''zhaijiao'' Buddhist groups.{{sfnp|Clart|Jones|2003|pp=20\u201321}} However, given the profound differences between Chinese and Japanese Buddhist traditions (among others, Japanese priests marry, eat meat and drink wine, all of which Chinese monks abstain from), the \"Japanisation\" of [[Chinese Buddhism]] was resisted by Taiwanese Buddhist communities.{{sfnp|Clart|Jones|2003|p=21}}\n\nIn 1915, Japanese religious policies in Taiwan changed after the \"[[Tapani incident|Xilai Hermitage incident]]\".{{sfnp|Clart|Jones|2003|p=21}} The hermitage was a ''zhaijiao'' Buddhist hall where the follower Yu Qingfang (\u4f59\u6e05\u82b3) started an anti-Japanese uprising, in which many other [[Chinese salvationist religions|folk religious]] and [[Taoism|Taoist]] sects took part.{{sfnp|Clart|Jones|2003|p=21}} The Japanese government discovered the plot and Yu Qingfang was executed in a speedy trial together with ninety-four other followers.{{sfnp|Clart|Jones|2003|p=21}}\n\nAfter the incident, the Japanese government became suspicious of what it called Taiwan's {{nihongo4|\"old religious customs\"||ky\u016bkan sh\u016bky\u014d}}.{{sfnp|Clart|Jones|2003|p=21}} The government began to investigate, register and regulate local temples, and it created islandwide Buddhist religious associations\u2014into which even ''zhaijiao'' Buddhist groups were enrolled\u2014whose charters recommended loyalty to the government.{{sfnp|Clart|Jones|2003|pp=21\u201323}}\n\nIn 1937, after the [[Marco Polo Bridge Incident]] and the start of the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], [[Tokyo]] ordered the rapid acculturation of the peoples of Japan's colonies.{{sfnp|Clart|Jones|2003|p=24}} This included an effort to disaccustom people from Chinese traditional religions and convert them into the nexus of [[State Shinto]].{{sfnp|Clart|Jones|2003|p=24}} Many [[Shinto shrine]]s were [[Shinto in Taiwan|established in Taiwan]]. Chinese family altars were replaced with ''[[kamidana]]'' and ''[[butsudan]]'', and a Japanese calendar of religious festivals was introduced.{{sfnp|Clart|Jones|2003|p=24}}\n\nThe subsequent \"temples' restructuration movement\" caused much consternation among the Chinese population and had far-reaching effects.{{sfnp|Clart|Jones|2003|p=25}} Its inception can be traced back to the \"Conference for Improving Popular Customs\" held in 1936, that far from promoting a razing of temples discussed measures for a reform and standardisation of Taoist and folk temple practices.{{sfnp|Clart|Jones|2003|p=24}}\n\nThe outbreak of open war between China and Japan in 1937 led to a proscription of practices and even stronger measures, as Japanese officials saw the religious culture centered around folk temples as the major obstacle to Japanisation.{{sfnp|Clart|Jones|2003|p=25}} Consequently, some local officials began to close and to demolish temples, burning their images, confiscating their cash and real estates, a measure that they called \"sending the gods to Heaven\".{{sfnp|Clart|Jones|2003|p=25}} In 1940, when a new governor-general took office, the \"temples' restructuration movement\" was halted.{{sfnp|Clart|Jones|2003|p=26}}\n\nThe Japanese persecution of Chinese folk religion led to an increase in skepticism and loss of faith among the Chinese.{{sfnp|Clart|Jones|2003|p=27}} As a result of this loss of faith in gods, Japanese police reported a general decline in public morals.{{sfnp|Clart|Jones|2003|p=27}} The policies also resulted in the disappearance of the small [[Muslim]] community, until [[Islam]] was reintroduced by the [[Kuomintang]] with their retreat from mainland China to Taiwan after the end of [[Chinese Civil War]] in 1949.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Gowing|first=Peter G.|title=Islam in Taiwan|journal=Saudi Aramco World|volume=21|number=4|date=July\u2013August 1970|url=http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/197004/islam.in.taiwan.htm}}</ref>\n\nAnother effect of the Japanese colonisation on religious life in Taiwan was due to the modernisation of infrastructures.{{sfnp|Clart|Jones|2003|p=29}} Before the 20th century the travel infrastructure of Taiwan was not very developed, and it was difficult for people to move from a part of the island to another.{{sfnp|Clart|Jones|2003|p=29}} The Japanese quickly constructed a network of railroads connecting all regions of the island.{{sfnp|Clart|Jones|2003|p=29}} In the field of religion, this promoted the rise in importance of some Buddhist, Taoist or folk temples as island-wide pilgrimage sites.{{sfnp|Clart|Jones|2003|p=29}} During this time, some gods lost their local and sub-ethnic nature and became \"pan-Taiwanese\".{{sfnp|Clart|Jones|2003|pp=29\u201331}}\n\n===1945 onwards\u2014Republic of China rule===\n[[File:Tian Yuan Gong.jpg|thumb|upright|200px|''Tianyuanggong'', a temple of [[Yiguandao]] in Tamsui, New Taipei.]]\n\nIn 1945, after the [[Second World War]], the administration of Taiwan was handed over to the [[Republic of China (1912\u201349)|Republic of China]] through [[General Order No. 1]]. The [[People's Republic of China]] was established four years later in [[mainland China]] under the [[Communist Party of China]].\n\nThe rapid [[economic growth]] of Taiwan since the 1970s and 1980s (\"[[Taiwan Miracle]]\") accompanied by a quick renewal of [[Chinese folk religion]], challenging [[Max Weber]]'s theories on [[secularisation]] and [[disenchantment]], has led many scholars to investigate how folk religious culture, with its emphasis on values like loyalty, its social network of temples and gods' societies, may have contributed to the island's economic development.{{sfnp|Rubinstein|2014|p=351}} During the same period, folk religions developed ties with [[environmentalism|environmental causes]].{{sfnp|Rubinstein|2014|p=355}} [[Chinese salvationist religions]] (such as earlier [[Xiantiandao]]) become increasingly popular in Taiwan after 1945, although some of them were illegal until the 1980s.{{sfnp|Rubinstein|2014|p=346}}\n\nAfter the 1950s, and especially since the 1970s, there was a significant growth of [[Buddhism]].{{sfnp|Rubinstein|2014|p=356}} [[Chinese Buddhism]] developed into distinctively [[Buddhist modernism|new forms]] with the foundation of movements like the [[Tzu Chi]], the [[Fo Guang Shan]] and the [[Dharma Drum Mountain]], which follow the philosophy of [[Humanistic Buddhism]] elaborated in China in the early 20th century.{{sfnp|Rubinstein|2014|p=357}} [[Tibetan Buddhism]] too was spread to the island.{{sfnp|Rubinstein|2014|p=357}} Since the 2000s there was an increasing cooperation between religious groups in Taiwan and mainland [[China]].{{sfnp|Rubinstein|2014|p=360}}{{sfnp|Brown|Cheng|2012|loc=''passim''}}\n\n==Religions==\n\n===Main religions===\n\n====Chinese folk religion====\n{{Main|Chinese folk religion}}\nChinese traditional, popular or folk religion, or simply Chinese religion, also called Shenism, defines the collection of [[grassroots]] [[ethnic religion|ethnic religious]] and spiritual experiences, disciplines, beliefs and practices of the [[Han Chinese]].

During the Japanese occupation, [[Buddhism in Japan|Japanese schools of Buddhism]] (such as [[Shingon Buddhism]], [[J\u014ddo Shinsh\u016b]], [[Nichiren Sh\u016b]]) gained influence over many Taiwanese Buddhist temples as part of the Japanese policy of cultural assimilation.{{sfnp|Clart|Jones|2003|pp=20\u201321}}\n\nAlthough many Buddhist communities affiliated themselves with Japanese sects for protection, they largely retained Chinese Buddhist practices. For instance the Japanisation of Chinese Buddhism, the introduction of clerical marriage and the practice of eating meat and drinking wine, was not as successful as in the [[Korean Buddhism|Buddhist tradition]] of [[Korea under Japanese rule|Japanese-occupied Korea]].{{sfnp|Clart|Jones|2003|pp=20\u201321}}\n\nFollowing the end of [[World War II]] and the establishment of the [[Republic of China (1912-1949)|Republic of China]] on the island, many monks from [[mainland China]] moved to Taiwan, including [[Yin Shun]] (\u5370\u9806). They gave significant contribution to the development of [[Chinese Buddhism]] on the island.\n\nThe Buddhist Association of the Republic of China remained the dominant Buddhist organisation until the end of restrictions of religious activities in the 1980s. Today there are several large [[Humanistic Buddhism|Humanistic Buddhist]] and [[Buddhist modernist]] organisations in Taiwan, including the [[Dharma Drum Mountain]] (''F\u0103g\u016dsh\u0101n'' {{lang|zh|\u6cd5\u9f13\u5c71}}) founded by [[Sheng-yen|Sheng Yen]] ({{lang|zh|\u8056\u56b4}}), [[Fo Guang Shan|Buddha's Light International]] (''F\u00f3g\u016dangsh\u0101n'' {{lang|zh|\u4f5b\u5149\u5c71}}) founded by [[Hsing Yun]] ({{lang|zh|\u661f\u96f2}}), and the [[Tzu Chi|Tzu Chi Foundation]] (''C\u00edj\u00ec j\u012bj\u012bnh\u00f9i'' {{lang|zh|\u6148\u6fdf\u57fa\u91d1\u6703}}) founded by [[Cheng Yen]] ({{lang|zh|\u8b49\u56b4\u6cd5\u5e2b}}).\n\nThe ''[[zhaijiao]]'' Buddhist groups maintain an influence in society.

Islam did not spread and their descendants became assimilated into the local Taiwanese society adopting the local customs and religions.\n\nDuring the [[Chinese Civil War]], some 20,000 Muslims, mostly soldiers and civil servants, fled mainland China with the [[Kuomintang]] to Taiwan. Since the 1980s, thousands of Muslims from Myanmar and Thailand, who are descendants of nationalist soldiers who fled [[Yunnan]] as a result of the communist takeover, have migrated to Taiwan in search of a better life.
