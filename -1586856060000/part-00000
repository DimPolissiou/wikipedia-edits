That degree focuses on [[Financial Economics|the underlying economics]], and on developing and testing theoretical models, and aims to prepare graduates for [[research]] based roles and for [[doctoral]] study.  The curriculum therefore emphasises coverage of financial theory, and of [[econometrics]], while the treatment of model ''implementation'' (through mathematical modeling and programming), while important, is secondary.

Some Financial Economics degrees are substantially quantitative, and are largely akin to the MQF.\n\nFor students whose interests in finance are commercial rather than [[academic]], a Masters in Quantitative Finance may be seen as an alternative to a [[PhD]] in finance.

That degree focuses on [[Financial Economics|the underlying economics]], and on developing and testing theoretical models, and aims to prepare graduates for [[research]] based roles and for [[doctoral]] study.  The curriculum therefore emphasises coverage of financial theory, and of [[econometrics]], while the treatment of model ''implementation'' (through mathematical modeling and programming), while important, is secondary. Entrance requirements are similarly less mathematical.  Some Financial Economics degrees are substantially quantitative, and are largely akin to the MQF.\n\nFor students whose interests in finance are commercial rather than [[academic]], a Masters in Quantitative Finance may be seen as an alternative to a [[PhD]] in finance.

The manga was originally [[Serial (literature)|serialized]] in ''[[Nakayoshi]]'' from May 1996 to June 2000, and published in 12 ''[[tank\u014dbon]]'' volumes by [[Kodansha]] from November 1996 to July 2000. The story focuses on [[Sakura Kinomoto]], an elementary school student in Japan who discovers magical powers after accidentally freeing a set of magical cards into the world; she must retrieve the cards to prevent catastrophe. Each of these cards grants different magical powers, and can only be activated by someone with inherent magical abilities. A sequel by Clamp, ''[[Cardcaptor Sakura: Clear Card]],'' focusing on Sakura in junior high school, began serialization in ''Nakayoshi'' in 2016.\n\nThe series was adapted into a 70-episode [[anime]] television series by [[Madhouse (company)|Madhouse]] that aired on Japan's [[satellite television]] channel [[NHK|NHK BS2]] from April 1998 to March 2000. Additional media include anime films, [[video game]]s, [[art book]]s, [[picture book]]s, and [[film comic]]s. [[Tokyopop]] released the manga in English in North America from March 2000 to August 2003. After Tokyopop's license expired, [[Dark Horse Comics|Dark Horse Manga]] released the series in omnibus editions from October 2010 to September 2012.</onlyinclude>\n\n[[Nelvana]] licensed the TV series and first film for North America under the English title '''''Cardcaptors''''', which first aired on [[Kids' WB]] from June 2000 to December 2001. All 70 episodes were [[dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbed]]; while other English-speaking territories received the full run, the version aired on American television was heavily edited into 39 episodes. ''Cardcaptors'' also aired on [[Cartoon Network]], [[Teletoon]] and [[Nickelodeon (UK and Ireland)|Nickelodeon]]. The TV series and films were sub-licensed by [[Geneon Universal Entertainment|Geneon]], which released them unedited with English subtitles.  The TV series was also released by [[Madman Entertainment]] in Australia and New Zealand.\n\n''Cardcaptor Sakura'' was critically well-received. Critics praised the manga for its creativity and described it as a quintessential ''sh\u014djo'' manga, as well as a critical work for manga in general. The manga series was awarded the [[Seiun Award]] for Best Manga in 2001. The television series was praised for transcending its target audience of young children and being enjoyable to older viewers, and for its artwork, humor, and animation; it won the [[Animage|Animage Grand Prix]] award for Best Anime in 1999. The American edit of ''Cardcaptors'', however, was criticized for removing elements essential to the plot.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Plot==\n{{see also|List of Cardcaptor Sakura characters}}\n''Cardcaptor Sakura'' takes place in the fictional Japanese city of Tomoeda which is somewhere near [[Tokyo]]. Ten-year-old [[Sakura Kinomoto]] accidentally releases a set of magical cards known as Clow Cards from a book in her basement created and named after the sorcerer Clow Reed. Each card has its own unique ability and can assume an alternate form when activated. The guardian of the cards, Cerberus, emerges from the book, explains only a person with magical powers could open the seal of the book, and chooses Sakura to retrieve the missing cards. As she finds each card, she battles its magical personification and defeats it by sealing it away. Cerberus acts as her guide, while her best friend and second cousin, Tomoyo Daidouji films her exploits and provides her with both battle costumes and morale support. Sakura's older brother Toya Kinomoto watches over her, while pretending that he is unaware of what is going on.\n\nSyaoran Li, a boy Sakura's age and descendant of Clow Reed, arrives from Hong Kong to recapture the cards himself. While initially antagonistic, he comes to respect Sakura and begins aiding her to capture the cards. Once Sakura captures all of the cards, she is tested by Yue, the cards' second guardian, to determine if she is worthy of becoming the cards' true master; Yue is also the true form of Yukito Tsukishiro, Toya's best friend. Aided by her school teacher Kaho Mizuki, Sakura passes the test and becomes the new master of the Clow Cards.\n\nAfterwards, Eriol Hiiragizawa, a transfer student from England, arrives in Tomoeda and begins causing disturbances with two guardian-like creatures, Spinel Sun and Ruby Moon. Sakura is suddenly unable to use the Clow Cards and transforms her wand, beginning the process of evolving the cards into Sakura Cards as Eriol causes strange occurrences that forces her to use and thus transform certain cards. Once all the cards have been transformed, Eriol tells Sakura that he aided her in converting the cards so they would not lose their magic powers. Syaoran later confesses his love to Sakura, who comes to realize she also loves him. ''Cardcaptor Sakura'' concludes with Syaoran returning to Hong Kong with a promise to return. Two years later, Syaoran moves back to Tomoeda permanently.\n\nThe plot of the anime series is extended, featuring 52 Clow Cards from the manga's original 19, and certain scenes are stretched and delayed, such as Cerberus' true form not being revealed until just before Yue's appearance.<ref name=\"Animerica\" /> Sakura creates a 53rd card, Hope, a talent she is not shown to have in the manga. Some of the circumstances around the capturing of the cards is changed, such as Syaoran capturing several cards himself and being tested by Yue in the Final Judgment. Syaoran's cousin and fianc\u00e9e Meiling Li is introduced in the anime, who positions herself as a jealous and romantic rival for Sakura later in the series and also a friend until she returns to Hong Kong. The TV series leaves the relationship between Sakura and Syaoran unresolved, but Sakura confesses her love to Syaoran at the end of the second anime film. In the OVA that bridges the stories of the original series and the ''Clear Card'' anime, Syaoran returns to Tomoeda two years later, just like in the manga.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2016-04-26/new-cardcaptor-sakura-manga-is-sequel-launching-in-june/.101473 |title=New Cardcaptor Sakura Manga Is Sequel Launching in June |date=April 26, 2016 |website=[[Anime News Network]] |accessdate=April 26, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\n''Cardcaptor Sakura'' was first conceived shortly before the conclusion of Clamp's ''[[Magic Knight Rayearth]]'', which was serialized in ''[[Nakayoshi]]''.<ref name=\"CCS-Memorial\">{{cite book|title=Cardcaptor Sakura Memorial Book|publisher=[[Kodansha]]|date=February 2001|isbn=978-4-06-324535-6|language=Japanese}}</ref> Clamp's head editor Yamonouchi asked them to do another series in ''Nakayoshi'', and Clamp decided to make a \"''Nakayoshi''-esque\" series, as opposed to ''Rayearth'', which Clamp described as unlike anything they had done before. Head Clamp writer [[Ageha Ohkawa|Nanase Ohkawa]]'s first impulse was to create a [[magical girl]] series, despite not being well-versed in the genre. Ohkawa wanted the heroine Sakura to be in the same age group as the majority of ''Nakayoshi''{{'}}s readers so that fans could relate to her. Due to it being different from how Clamp normally conceived characters, Ohkawa designed the other characters such as Tomoyo and Cerberus to be more like Clamp's previous creations. Once Ohkawa had enough information on the characters, she had the three artists in Clamp\u2014[[Mokona]], [[Tsubaki Nekoi]] and [[Satsuki Igarashi]]\u2014design them based on her descriptions. When designing Cerberus, Ohkawa wanted a mascot-type companion for Sakura, but Nekoi tried various forms, including dogs and squirrels, before designing the final version. Syaoran and Toya were conceived to be a common type of character featured in Clamp's works.<ref name=\"CCS-Memorial\"/>\n\nVarious other titles were suggested for the series such as ''Cardcaster Sakura'' and ''Card Character Sakura'' before Nekoi suggested ''Cardcaptor Sakura''.<ref name=\"CCS-Memorial\"/> While Ohkawa planned out ''Cardcaptor Sakura'' from beginning to end, she never consulted the plot with the other members, instead giving them the script one chapter at a time. Mokona initially drew Tomoyo so it would look like she was in love with Toya, which led to her surprise when she received the script for the chapter which reveals Tomoyo loves Sakura. The story was planned to have the theme of \"if you try your best, it'll work out\", but Ohkawa did not start out with Sakura's \"It'll definitely be okay\" mindset. Ohkawa wanted to write a story that \"minorities would feel comfortable with,\" referring to the [[Same-sex relationship|same-sex]] and [[taboo]] relationships featured in the manga. The series' main theme is expressed through Sakura, a main character designed to be open-minded about different family structures and kinds of love. Ohkawa addressed the relationships featured in the series by using Tomoyo and Sakura as an example. She explained that the reason Tomoyo and Sakura did not end up together was not because Tomoyo is a girl, but rather because Sakura did not love Tomoyo in a romantic way.<ref name=\"CCS-Memorial\"/>\n\nThe central theme of ''Cardcaptor Sakura'' is [[love]] and human relationships. Throughout the series, many forms of love are showcased, including \"sibling love, childhood crushes, unrequited love, [and] true love.\"<ref name=\"MangaGuide\" /> At times, Clamp even ignores the Clow Cards for several chapters to focus more on the relationships of Sakura and those around her. Each of these relationships are presented as is, with Clamp carefully avoiding passing judgment on the correctness of the relationships. In particular, the romantic relationship between elementary student [[Rika Sasaki]] and her teacher [[Yoshiyuki Terada]] is presented in such a way that it can be seen as a sweet and innocent tale of \"wish fulfillment\", or if examined more seriously, as a mildly disturbing story of [[Pedophilia|pedophilic]] love.<ref name=\"MangaGuide\" />\n\nThe artists, especially Mokona, were told by Ohkawa to use thin lines and to try to express things through curved lines as opposed to straight lines.<ref name=\"CCS-Memorial\"/> The style of artwork was decided at the beginning to unify the world view of ''Cardcaptor Sakura''. Ohkawa wanted the series to have a \"soft, cute-like\" feel, so she asked the artists to not use a lot of ink and to make the pages light. For the multitude of flower imagery used in the manga, Nekoi looked through various books to find appropriate flowers, and tried to avoid using the same flower more than once in one chapter. Igarashi remarked that they \"never had to draw so many flowers for one series,\" but they made a point to not use roses.<ref name=\"CCS-Memorial\"/> Clamp wanted to incorporate transformation scenes into ''Cardcaptor Sakura'', but because many magical girl manga have the girls wearing the same outfit, they wanted Sakura to wear different costumes. They felt that \"it's pretty sad for a girl to wear the same outfit all the time.\"<ref>{{cite news|author=Solomon, Charles|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/28/arts/design/28clam.html?_r=1|title=Four Mothers of Manga Gain American Fans With Expertise in a Variety of Visual Styles|publisher=The New York Times|date=November 28, 2006|accessdate=September 26, 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Media==\n===Manga===\n{{see also|List of Cardcaptor Sakura chapters}}\n''Cardcaptor Sakura'' began as a [[manga]] series written and illustrated by the manga artist group [[Clamp (manga artists)|Clamp]].

The manga was originally [[Serial (literature)|serialized]] in ''[[Nakayoshi]]'' from May 1996 to June 2000, and published in 12 ''[[tank\u014dbon]]'' volumes by [[Kodansha]] from November 1996 to July 2000. The story focuses on [[Sakura Kinomoto]], an elementary school student in Japan who discovers magical powers after accidentally freeing a set of magical cards into the world; she must retrieve the cards to prevent catastrophe. Each of these cards grants different magical powers, and can only be activated by someone with inherent magical abilities. A sequel by Clamp, ''[[Cardcaptor Sakura: Clear Card]],'' focusing on Sakura in junior high school, began serialization in ''Nakayoshi'' in 2016.\n\nThe series was adapted into a 70-episode [[anime]] television series by [[Madhouse (company)|Madhouse]] that aired on Japan's [[satellite television]] channel [[NHK|NHK BS2]] from April 1998 to March 2000. Additional media include anime films, [[video game]]s, [[art book]]s, [[picture book]]s, and [[film comic]]s. [[Tokyopop]] released the manga in English in North America from March 2000 to August 2003. After Tokyopop's license expired, [[Dark Horse Comics|Dark Horse Manga]] released the series in omnibus editions from October 2010 to September 2012.</onlyinclude>\n\n[[Nelvana]] licensed the TV series and first film for North America under the English title '''''Cardcaptors''''', which first aired on [[Kids' WB]] from June 2000 to December 2001. All 70 episodes were [[dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbed]]; while other English-speaking territories received the full run, the version aired on American television was heavily edited into 39 episodes. ''Cardcaptors'' also aired on [[Cartoon Network]], [[Teletoon]] and [[Nickelodeon (UK and Ireland)|Nickelodeon]]. The TV series and films were sub-licensed by [[Geneon Universal Entertainment|Geneon]], which released them unedited with English subtitles.  The TV series was also released by [[Madman Entertainment]] in Australia and New Zealand.\n\n''Cardcaptor Sakura'' was critically well-received. Critics praised the manga for its creativity and described it as a quintessential ''sh\u014djo'' manga, as well as a critical work for manga in general. The manga series was awarded the [[Seiun Award]] for Best Manga in 2001. The television series was praised for transcending its target audience of young children and being enjoyable to older viewers, and for its artwork, humor, and animation; it won the [[Animage|Animage Grand Prix]] award for Best Anime in 1999. The American edit of ''Cardcaptors'', however, was criticized for removing elements essential to the plot.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Plot==\n{{see also|List of Cardcaptor Sakura characters}}\n''Cardcaptor Sakura'' takes place in the fictional Japanese city of Tomoeda which is somewhere near [[Tokyo]]. Ten-year-old [[Sakura Kinomoto]] accidentally releases a set of magical cards known as Clow Cards from a book in her basement created and named after the sorcerer Clow Reed. Each card has its own unique ability and can assume an alternate form when activated. The guardian of the cards, Cerberus, emerges from the book, explains only a person with magical powers could open the seal of the book, and chooses Sakura to retrieve the missing cards. As she finds each card, she battles its magical personification and defeats it by sealing it away. Cerberus acts as her guide, while her best friend and second cousin, Tomoyo Daidouji films her exploits and provides her with both battle costumes and morale support. Sakura's older brother Toya Kinomoto watches over her, while pretending that he is unaware of what is going on.\n\nSyaoran Li, a boy Sakura's age and descendant of Clow Reed, arrives from Hong Kong to recapture the cards himself. While initially antagonistic, he comes to respect Sakura and begins aiding her to capture the cards. Once Sakura captures all of the cards, she is tested by Yue, the cards' second guardian, to determine if she is worthy of becoming the cards' true master; Yue is also the true form of Yukito Tsukishiro, Toya's best friend. Aided by her school teacher Kaho Mizuki, Sakura passes the test and becomes the new master of the Clow Cards.\n\nAfterwards, Eriol Hiiragizawa, a transfer student from England, arrives in Tomoeda and begins causing disturbances with two guardian-like creatures, Spinel Sun and Ruby Moon. Sakura is suddenly unable to use the Clow Cards and transforms her wand, beginning the process of evolving the cards into Sakura Cards as Eriol causes strange occurrences that forces her to use and thus transform certain cards. Once all the cards have been transformed, Eriol tells Sakura that he aided her in converting the cards so they would not lose their magic powers. Syaoran later confesses his love to Sakura, who comes to realize she also loves him. ''Cardcaptor Sakura'' concludes with Syaoran returning to Hong Kong with a promise to return. Two years later, Syaoran moves back to Tomoeda permanently.\n\nThe plot of the anime series is extended, featuring 52 Clow Cards from the manga's original 19, and certain scenes are stretched and delayed, such as Cerberus' true form not being revealed until just before Yue's appearance.<ref name=\"Animerica\" /> Sakura creates a 53rd card, Hope, a talent she is not shown to have in the manga. Some of the circumstances around the capturing of the cards is changed, such as Syaoran capturing several cards himself and being tested by Yue in the Final Judgment. Syaoran's cousin and fianc\u00e9e Meiling Li is introduced in the anime, who positions herself as a jealous and romantic rival for Sakura later in the series and also a friend until she returns to Hong Kong. The TV series leaves the relationship between Sakura and Syaoran unresolved, but Sakura confesses her love to Syaoran at the end of the second anime film. In the OVA that bridges the stories of the original series and the ''Clear Card'' anime, Syaoran returns to Tomoeda two years later, just like in the manga.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2016-04-26/new-cardcaptor-sakura-manga-is-sequel-launching-in-june/.101473 |title=New Cardcaptor Sakura Manga Is Sequel Launching in June |date=April 26, 2016 |website=[[Anime News Network]] |accessdate=April 26, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\n''Cardcaptor Sakura'' was first conceived shortly before the conclusion of Clamp's ''[[Magic Knight Rayearth]]'', which was serialized in ''[[Nakayoshi]]''.<ref name=\"CCS-Memorial\">{{cite book|title=Cardcaptor Sakura Memorial Book|publisher=[[Kodansha]]|date=February 2001|isbn=978-4-06-324535-6|language=Japanese}}</ref> Clamp's head editor Yamonouchi asked them to do another series in ''Nakayoshi'', and Clamp decided to make a \"''Nakayoshi''-esque\" series, as opposed to ''Rayearth'', which Clamp described as unlike anything they had done before. Head Clamp writer [[Ageha Ohkawa|Nanase Ohkawa]]'s first impulse was to create a [[magical girl]] series, despite not being well-versed in the genre. Ohkawa wanted the heroine Sakura to be in the same age group as the majority of ''Nakayoshi''{{'}}s readers so that fans could relate to her. Due to it being different from how Clamp normally conceived characters, Ohkawa designed the other characters such as Tomoyo and Cerberus to be more like Clamp's previous creations. Once Ohkawa had enough information on the characters, she had the three artists in Clamp\u2014[[Mokona]], [[Tsubaki Nekoi]] and [[Satsuki Igarashi]]\u2014design them based on her descriptions. When designing Cerberus, Ohkawa wanted a mascot-type companion for Sakura, but Nekoi tried various forms, including dogs and squirrels, before designing the final version. Syaoran and Toya were conceived to be a common type of character featured in Clamp's works.<ref name=\"CCS-Memorial\"/>\n\nVarious other titles were suggested for the series such as ''Cardcaster Sakura'' and ''Card Character Sakura'' before Nekoi suggested ''Cardcaptor Sakura''.<ref name=\"CCS-Memorial\"/> While Ohkawa planned out ''Cardcaptor Sakura'' from beginning to end, she never consulted the plot with the other members, instead giving them the script one chapter at a time. Mokona initially drew Tomoyo so it would look like she was in love with Toya, which led to her surprise when she received the script for the chapter which reveals Tomoyo loves Sakura. The story was planned to have the theme of \"if you try your best, it'll work out\", but Ohkawa did not start out with Sakura's \"It'll definitely be okay\" mindset. Ohkawa wanted to write a story that \"minorities would feel comfortable with,\" referring to the [[Same-sex relationship|same-sex]] and [[taboo]] relationships featured in the manga. The series' main theme is expressed through Sakura, a main character designed to be open-minded about different family structures and kinds of love. Ohkawa addressed the relationships featured in the series by using Tomoyo and Sakura as an example. She explained that the reason Tomoyo and Sakura did not end up together was not because Tomoyo is a girl, but rather because Sakura did not love Tomoyo in a romantic way.<ref name=\"CCS-Memorial\"/>\n\nThe central theme of ''Cardcaptor Sakura'' is [[love]] and human relationships. Throughout the series, many forms of love are showcased, including \"sibling love, childhood crushes, unrequited love, [and] true love.\"<ref name=\"MangaGuide\" /> At times, Clamp even ignores the Clow Cards for several chapters to focus more on the relationships of Sakura and those around her. Each of these relationships are presented as is, with Clamp carefully avoiding passing judgment on the correctness of the relationships. In particular, the romantic relationship between elementary student [[Rika Sasaki]] and her teacher [[Yoshiyuki Terada]] is presented in such a way that it can be seen as a sweet and innocent tale of \"wish fulfillment\", or if examined more seriously, as a mildly disturbing story of [[Pedophilia|pedophilic]] love.<ref name=\"MangaGuide\" />\n\nThe artists, especially Mokona, were told by Ohkawa to use thin lines and to try to express things through curved lines as opposed to straight lines.<ref name=\"CCS-Memorial\"/> The style of artwork was decided at the beginning to unify the world view of ''Cardcaptor Sakura''. Ohkawa wanted the series to have a \"soft, cute-like\" feel, so she asked the artists to not use a lot of ink and to make the pages light. For the multitude of flower imagery used in the manga, Nekoi looked through various books to find appropriate flowers, and tried to avoid using the same flower more than once in one chapter.

This ended on 1 January 1961, when western Staaken was incorporated into then East German [[Falkensee]], which had already been under its de facto administration since 1 June 1952.\n\nBetween 1961 and 1990 Mitte, one of the most important boroughs of East Berlin but close to all three [[West Berlin|western sectors]] of the city, was almost surrounded by the [[Berlin Wall]]. One of the most important border crossings was [[Checkpoint Charlie]], near [[Kreuzberg]].<ref>{{in lang|de}} [http://www.berlin.de/ba-mitte/bezirk/ortsteile/mitte.html Historical infos about Mitte]</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n\n===Position===\nSituated in central Berlin and mostly in its old town, it is traversed by the river [[Spree]].

A second ''First Life'' or ''Vita Prima'' of St Brigid is by an unknown author, although it is often attributed to St [[Brocc\u00e1n Cl\u00f3en]] (d. 650). This book is occasionally argued to be the first written Life of St. Brigid, although most scholars reject this claim. The ''Life'' attributed to Coelan dating ca. 625, derives further significance from the fact that a foreword was later added to it by St [[Donatus of Fiesole|Donatus]], also an Irish monk, who became Bishop of Fiesole in 824. Donatus refers to earlier biographies by [[Saint Ultan|St Ultan]] and [[Ailer\u00e1n|St Ailer\u00e1n]]. These differing biographies, giving conflicting accounts of her life, have much literary merit in themselves.<ref name=catholic/>\n\nIn the controversy about the historical existence of Brigid that erupted in the last third of the 20th century, researchers noted that eleven people with whom Brigid is associated in her ''Lives'' are independently attested in annalistic sources which place her death at AD 523 (in the ''[[Annals of Tigernach]]'' and ''[[Chronicon Scotorum]]'') and her birth at 451 (calculated from her reputed age of 72 at death).<ref>\nDiscussion on dates for the annals and the accuracy of dates relating to St Brigid continues, see AP Smyth, \"The earliest Irish Annals: their first contemporary entries and the earliest centres of recording\", ''Proceedings of the [[Royal Irish Academy]]'' lxxii C (1972), pp1\u201348 Daniel McCarthy: ''The chronology of St Brigit of Kildare'', in ''Peritia'', xiv (2000), pp255\u201381.</ref>\n\n===Early life===\nAccording to tradition, Brigid was born in the year 451 AD in [[Faughart]],<ref name=Joyce/> just north of [[Dundalk]]<ref name=\"Story of St. Brigid\">{{cite web|url=http://www.stbrigid.ie/story-of-st-brigid.html|title=Story of St. Brigid|work=St. Brigid's GNS, Glasnevin}}</ref><ref name=\"irishcatholic.ie\">{{cite web|url=http://irishcatholic.ie/article/following-brigid%E2%80%99s-way|title=Following Brigid\u2019s Way \u2013 The Irish Catholic|publisher=}}</ref> in [[County Louth]], [[Ireland]]. Because of the legendary quality of the earliest accounts of her life, there is debate among many secular scholars and Christians as to the authenticity of her biographies. Three biographies agree that her mother was Brocca, a Christian [[Picts|Pict]] slave who had been baptized by [[Saint Patrick]]. They name her father as Dubhthach, a chieftain of [[Leinster]].<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ucc.ie/celt/published/T201002/index.html|title=Bethu Brigte|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nThe ''vitae'' say that Dubthach's wife forced him to sell Brigid's mother to a druid when she became pregnant. Brigid herself was born into slavery. Legends of her early holiness include her vomiting when the druid tried to feed her, due to his impurity; a white cow with red ears appeared to sustain her instead.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\nAs she grew older, Brigid performed miracles, including healing and feeding the poor. According to one tale, as a child, she once gave away her mother's entire store of butter. The butter was then replenished in answer to Brigid's prayers.<ref>Wallace, Martin. ''A Little Book of Celtic Saints''. Belfast. Appletree Press, 1995 {{ISBN|0-86281-456-1}}, p.13</ref> Around the age of ten, she was returned as a household servant to her father, where her habit of charity led her to donate his belongings to anyone who asked.\n\nIn two ''Lives'', Dubthach was so annoyed with her that he took her in a chariot to [[Crimthann mac \u00c9nnai|the King of Leinster]] to sell her. While Dubthach was talking to the king, Brigid gave away his jewelled sword to a beggar to barter it for food to feed his family. The king recognized her holiness and convinced Dubthach to grant his daughter her freedom.<ref name=Bitel>{{cite web|url=http://monasticmatrix.osu.edu/commentaria/st-brigit-ireland#_ftn1|title=St Brigit of Ireland \u2013 Monastic Matrix|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===Religious life===\n[[File:Saint Non's Chapel - Fenster 3 St.Bride.jpg|thumb|upright|Saint Brigid as depicted in Saint Non's chapel, [[St Davids]], Wales.]]\nIt is said that Brigid was \"veiled\" or received either by St Mac Caill, Bishop of Cruachu Brig Ele ([[Croghan, County Offaly|Croghan]], [[County Offaly]]),<ref>[[John O'Donovan (scholar)|O'Donovan, J.]], ''Annals of the Kingdom of Ireland'', Vol 5 (Dublin: Hodges, Smith, and Co., 1856), p. 1249.</ref> or by St [[M\u00e9l of Ardagh]] at M\u00e1g Tulach (the present barony of [[Tyrrellspass|Fartullagh, County Westmeath]]), who granted her abbatial powers. It is said that in about 468, she and a [[Croghan_Hill#Historical_associations|Bishop MacCaille]] followed St M\u00e9l into the Kingdom of [[Tethbae]], which was made up of parts of the modern counties [[County Meath|Meath]], [[County Westmeath|Westmeath]] and [[County Longford|Longford]].\n\nAccording to tradition, around 480 Brigid founded a monastery at [[Kildare]] (''Cill Dara'': \"church of the oak\"), on the site of a pagan shrine to the Celtic goddess Brigid, served by a group of young women who tended an [[eternal flame]]. The site was under a large oak tree on the ridge of Drum Criadh.<ref name=Kildare>{{cite web|url=http://kildarelocalhistory.ie/kildare/history-of-kildare-town/|title=History of Kildare Town|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nBrigid, with an initial group of seven companions, is credited with organizing communal consecrated religious life for women in Ireland.<ref name=cna>{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/saint.php?n=134ST.|title=ST. BRIGID OF IRELAND :: Catholic News Agency (CNA)|work=Catholic News Agency}}</ref> She founded two monastic institutions, one for men, and the other for women, and invited [[Conleth]] (Conl\u00e1ed), a hermit from Old Connell near Newbridge, to help her in Kildare as pastor of them. It has often been said that she gave canonical jurisdiction to Conleth, [[Bishop of Kildare]], but Archbishop Healy says that she simply \"selected the person to whom the Church gave this jurisdiction\", and her biographer tells us that she chose Saint Conleth \"to govern the church along with herself\". For centuries, Kildare was ruled by a double line of abbot-bishops and of abbesses, the Abbess of Kildare being regarded as [[superior general]] of the monasteries in Ireland.<ref name=catholic/> Her successors have always been accorded episcopal honour.<ref>Edward Sellnor, ''Wisdom of the Celtic Saints'' (Ave Maria Press, 1993)</ref> Brigid's oratory at Kildare became a centre of religion and learning, and developed into a cathedral city.<ref name=catholic/>\n\nBrigid is credited with founding a school of art, including metalwork and illumination, which Conleth oversaw. The Kildare scriptorium made the [[Book of Kildare]], which drew high praise from [[Gerald of Wales]] (Giraldus Cambrensis), but disappeared during the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]. According to Giraldus, nothing that he ever saw was at all comparable to the book, every page of which was gorgeously illuminated, and the interlaced work and the harmony of the colours left the impression that \"all this is the work of angelic, and not human skill\".<ref name=catholic/>\n\nAccording to the ''[[Trias Thaumaturga]]'' Brigid spent time in Connacht and founded many churches in the Diocese of Elphin. She is said to have visited Longford, Tipperary, Limerick, and South Leinster.<ref name=Joyce/> Her friendship with Saint Patrick is noted in the following paragraph from the [[Book of Armagh]]: ''\"inter sanctum Patricium Brigitanque Hibernesium columpnas amicitia caritatis inerat tanta, ut unum cor consiliumque haberent unum. Christus per illum illamque virtutes multas peregit\"'' (''Between St Patrick and St Brigid, the pillars of the Irish people, there was so great a friendship of charity that they had but one heart and one mind. Through him and through her Christ performed many great works.'')<ref name=catholic/>\n\n===Death===\nThe monk [[Ultan of Ardbraccan]], who wrote a life of Brigid, recounts a story that [[Dar Lugdach|Darlugdach]], Brigid's favourite pupil, fell in love with a young man and, hoping to meet him, sneaked out of the bed in which she and Brigid were sleeping. However, recognising her spiritual peril, she prayed for guidance, then placed burning embers in her shoes and put them on. \u201cThus, by fire,\u201dUltan wrote, \u201cshe put out fire, and by pain extinguished pain.\u201d<ref>{{cite journal |title=Darlugdach |journal=Dictionary of National Biography |date=1888 |volume=14 |page=63 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hSwJAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA63&lpg=PA63&dq=she+put+out+fire,+and+by+pain+extinguished+pain.&source=bl&ots=-p4oWc4v9p&sig=ACfU3U162RWPDufxStWArN2kvJf1DdDnSA&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj3ku6j4fbfAhXii60KHQ_lAzcQ6AEwC3oECAcQAQ#v=onepage&q=she%20put%20out%20fire%2C%20and%20by%20pain%20extinguished%20pain.&f=false |accessdate=18 January 2019}}</ref> She then returned to bed. Brigid feigned sleep, but was aware of Darlugdach's departure. The next day, Darlugdach revealed to Brigid the experience of the night before. Brigid reassured her that she was \u201cnow safe from the fire of passion and the fire of hell hereafter\u201d<ref>{{cite journal |title=Darlugdach}}</ref> and then healed her student's feet. So devoted was the student to her teacher that when Brigid lay dying Darlugdach expressed the wish to die with her, but Brigid replied that Darlugdach should die on the anniversary of her (Brigid's) death.\n\nSt Brigid is said to have been given the [[last rites]] by St Ninnidh when she was dying. Afterwards, he reportedly had his right hand encased in metal so that it would never be defiled, and became known as \"Ninnidh of the Clean Hand\".<ref name=catholic/> Tradition says she died at Kildare on 1 February 525.<ref name=sisters>[http://www.brigidine.org.au/about-us/index.cfm?loadref=13 ''Our Patroness'', Brigidine Sisters] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150202194641/http://www.brigidine.org.au/about-us/index.cfm?loadref=13 |date=2 February 2015 }}</ref>\n\nUpon St Brigid's death, Darlugdach became the second abbess of Kildare. Brigid's prediction has traditionally been considered to have been realized inasmuch as the [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic Church]] records Darlugdach's date of death as 522 and Brigid's as 521 and has assigned 1 February as the [[Calendar of saints|feast day]] of both saints.<ref>{{cite book|editor-last1=Olden|editor-first1=Thomas|title=Dictionary of National Biography, 1885-1900, Vol. 14|date=1885\u20131900|publisher=Smith & Elder|location=London|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Darlugdach_(DNB00)|accessdate=16 July 2017}}</ref> (The name Darlugdach (also spelled Dar Lugdach, Dar Lugdacha, or Dar Lughdacha) means \"daughter of the god [[Lugh]]\".)<ref>Wright, p.41</ref>\n\n==Miracles associated with Brigid==\nBrigid is celebrated for her generosity to the poor. In her case, most of the miracles associated with her relate to healing and household tasks usually attributed to women.\n\n*Brigid, who had a reputation as an expert dairywoman and brewer, was reputed to turn water into beer.<ref name=Bitel/> \n*The prayers of Saint Brigid were said to still the wind and the rain.<ref>[http://irishamerica.com/2018/01/wild-irish-women-saint-brigid-mary-of-the-gaels/ Rogers, Rosemary. \"Wild Irish Women: Saint Brigid\u2014Mary of the Gaels\", ''Irish American'', February/March 2018]</ref> \n*When Brigid was of marital age, a man by the name of [[Dubthach maccu Lugair]] came to woo her. Since Brigid had offered her virginity to God, she told the man that she could not accept him but that he should go to the woods behind his house where he would find a beautiful maiden to marry. Everything that he said to the maiden's parents would be pleasing to them. The man followed her instructions and it was as she said.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n*In one story, Brigid protected a woman from a nobleman who had entrusted a silver brooch to the woman for safekeeping but then secretly had thrown it into the sea. He charged her with stealing it, knowing that he could take her as a slave if a judge ruled in his favour. The woman fled and sought refuge with Brigid's community. By chance, one of her fishermen hauled in a fish which, when cut open, proved to have swallowed the brooch. The nobleman freed the woman, confessed his sin, and bowed in submission to Brigid.<ref name=Bitel/> A similar story is told of [[Saint Mungo]].\n*On an occasion when Brigid was travelling to see a doctor for a headache, she stayed at the house of a Leinster couple who had two mute daughters. The daughters were travelling with Brigid when her horse startled, causing her to fall and graze her head on a stone. A touch of Brigid's blood healed the girls of their muteness.<ref name=Bitel/>\n*When on the bank of the [[River Inny, Westmeath|River Inny]], Brigid was given a gift of apples and sweet sloes. She later entered a house where many lepers begged her for these apples, which she offered willingly. The woman who had given the gift to Brigid was angered by this, saying that she had not given the gift to the lepers. Brigid was angry at the nun for withholding from the lepers and cursed her trees so they would no longer bear fruit.  Yet another woman also gave Brigid the same gift, and again Brigid gave them to begging lepers. This woman asked that she and her garden be blessed. Brigid then said that a large tree in the virgin's garden would have twofold fruit from its offshoots, and this was done.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n*One of the more commonly told stories is of Brigid asking the King of Leinster for land. She told the king that the place where she stood was the perfect spot for a convent. It was beside a forest where the members could collect firewood and berries, there was a lake nearby that would provide water and the land was fertile. The king laughed at her and refused to give her any land. Brigid prayed and asked God to soften the king's heart. Then she smiled at the king and said, \"Will you give me as much land as my cloak will cover?\" The king thought that she was joking and agreed. She told four of her sisters to take up the cloak, but instead of laying it flat on the turf, each sister, with face turned to a different point of the compass, began to run swiftly, the cloth growing in all directions. The cloak began to cover many acres of land. \"Oh, Brigid!\" said the frighted king, \"what are you about?\" \"I am, or rather my cloak is about covering your whole province to punish you for your stinginess to the poor.\" \"Call your maidens back. I will give you a decent plot of ground.\" The saint was persuaded, and if the king held his purse-strings tight in future, she had only to allude to her cloak to bring him to reason. Soon afterwards, the king became a Christian, began to help the poor and commissioned the building of the convent. Legend has it, the convent was known for making jam from the local blueberries which was sought for all over Ireland. A new tradition is to eat jam on 1 February in honour of this miracle.<ref>[http://www.stbrigid.ie/content/story-st-brigid Story of St. Brigid, November 14, 2012] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130127102537/http://www.stbrigid.ie/content/story-st-brigid |date=27 January 2013 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.libraryireland.com/LegendaryFictionsIrishCelts/V-12-1.php/ Kennedy, Patrick.

When she was outside carrying a load past a group of poor people, some began to laugh at her. A man named Bacene said to her, \"The beautiful eye which is in your head will be betrothed to a man though you like it or not.\" In response, Brigid thrust her finger in her eye and said, \"Here is that beautiful eye for you. I deem it unlikely that anyone will ask you for a blind girl.\" Her brothers tried to save her and wash away the blood from her wound, but there was no water to be found. Brigid said to them, \"Put my staff about this sod in front of you\", and after they did, a stream came forth from the ground. Then she said to Bacene, \"Soon your two eyes will burst in your head\", and it happened as she said.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n*She is associated with the preservation of a nun's chastity in unusual circumstances.

W., ''The Wonders of Ireland'', 1911]</ref> Leitmotifs, some of them borrowed from the [[apocrypha]] such as the story where she hangs her cloak on a sunbeam, are associated with the wonder tales of her hagiography and folklore. In her ''Lives'', Brigid is portrayed as having the power to multiply such things as butter, bacon and milk, to bestow sheep and cattle and to control the weather.\n\nPlant motifs associated with St Brigid include the white ''[[Lilium candidum]]'' popularly known since medieval times as the Madonna Lily for its association with the [[Virgin Mary]], and the Windflower ''[[Anemone coronaria]]'', called the \"Brigid anemone\"  since the early 19th century. Kildare, the church of the oak ''[[Quercus petraea]]'', is associated with a tree sacred to the [[Druid#Irish literature and law codes|druids]]. The colour associated with Brigid is white, worn not only by the Kildare [[United Irishmen]] during the [[1798 rebellion]], but also by [[Kildare GAA|Kildare sports teams]] in more recent times.\n\n===Placenames===\n[[File:Gross stmartin brigida von kildare.jpg|thumb|Brigida von Kildare, Gross St Martin, K\u00f6ln]]\n* Kilbride (\"Church of Brigid\") is one of Ireland's most widely found placenames, there are 43 Kilbrides located in 19 of Ireland's 32 counties:  Antrim (2), Carlow, Cavan, Down, Dublin, Galway, Kildare, Kilkenny (3), Laois, Longford, Louth, Mayo (5), Meath (4), Offaly (4), Roscommon (2), Waterford, Westmeath (2), Wexford (4), and Wicklow (8) as well as two Kilbreedys in Tipperary, Kilbreedia and Toberbreeda in Clare, Toberbreedia in Kilkenny, Brideswell Commons in Dublin, Bridestown and Templebreedy in Cork and Rathbride and Brideschurch in Kildare.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.logainm.ie/|title=logainm.ie|work=logainm.ie}}</ref> A number of placenames are derived from ''Cnoic Bhr\u00edde'' (\"Brigid's Hill\"), such as [[Knockbridge]] in Louth and [[Knockbride]] in Cavan. \n* In Wales, the villages of [[Llansanffraid Glan Conwy]], [[Llansantffraid-ym-Mechain]], [[Llansantffraed]] and [[Llansantffraid, Ceredigion]] are named after her; \"llan\" meaning \"church of\" and \"Ffraid\" or \"Ffraed\" being the Welsh for \"Bride\".{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n* In Scotland, East Kilbride and West Kilbride are called after Brigid.

They carry a hay-stuffed ''Br\u00edde\u00f3g'' doll with them to ensure evil spirits are kept away from humans and animals for the coming year. The Biddy heritage is a mixture of Christianity (St Bridgid) and ancient Celtic traditions ([[Imbolc]]). Imbolc is one of the four Celtic festivals, along with L\u00e1 Bealtaine (Mayday), Lughnasa (1 August) and Samhain (1 November).<ref>Consid\u00e8re-Charon, M.-C., Laplace, P., & Savaric, M., eds., ''The Irish Celebrating: Festive and Tragic Overtones'' (Cambridge: Cambridge Scholars Publishing, 2008), [https://books.google.com/books?id=nawYBwAAQBAJ&pg=PA2#v=onepage&q&f=false p. 2].</ref>{{rp|2}}\nTraditionally, a visit from the Biddy guaranteed good luck, fertility, prosperity and to not receive a visit was considered a slight.

A second ''First Life'' or ''Vita Prima'' of St Brigid is by an unknown author, although it is often attributed to St [[Brocc\u00e1n Cl\u00f3en]] (d. 650). This book is occasionally argued to be the first written Life of St. Brigid, although most scholars reject this claim. The ''Life'' attributed to Coelan dating ca. 625, derives further significance from the fact that a foreword was later added to it by St [[Donatus of Fiesole|Donatus]], also an Irish monk, who became Bishop of Fiesole in 824. Donatus refers to earlier biographies by [[Saint Ultan|St Ultan]] and [[Ailer\u00e1n|St Ailer\u00e1n]]. These differing biographies, giving conflicting accounts of her life, have much literary merit in themselves.<ref name=catholic/>\n\nIn the controversy about the historical existence of Brigid that erupted in the last third of the 20th century, researchers noted that eleven people with whom Brigid is associated in her ''Lives'' are independently attested in annalistic sources which place her death at AD 523 (in the ''[[Annals of Tigernach]]'' and ''[[Chronicon Scotorum]]'') and her birth at 451 (calculated from her reputed age of 72 at death).<ref>\nDiscussion on dates for the annals and the accuracy of dates relating to St Brigid continues, see AP Smyth, \"The earliest Irish Annals: their first contemporary entries and the earliest centres of recording\", ''Proceedings of the [[Royal Irish Academy]]'' lxxii C (1972), pp1\u201348 Daniel McCarthy: ''The chronology of St Brigit of Kildare'', in ''Peritia'', xiv (2000), pp255\u201381.</ref>\n\n===Early life===\nAccording to tradition, Brigid was born in the year 451 AD in [[Faughart]],<ref name=Joyce/> just north of [[Dundalk]]<ref name=\"Story of St. Brigid\">{{cite web|url=http://www.stbrigid.ie/story-of-st-brigid.html|title=Story of St. Brigid|work=St. Brigid's GNS, Glasnevin}}</ref><ref name=\"irishcatholic.ie\">{{cite web|url=http://irishcatholic.ie/article/following-brigid%E2%80%99s-way|title=Following Brigid\u2019s Way \u2013 The Irish Catholic|publisher=}}</ref> in [[County Louth]], [[Ireland]]. Because of the legendary quality of the earliest accounts of her life, there is debate among many secular scholars and Christians as to the authenticity of her biographies. Three biographies agree that her mother was Brocca, a Christian [[Picts|Pict]] slave who had been baptized by [[Saint Patrick]]. They name her father as Dubhthach, a chieftain of [[Leinster]].<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ucc.ie/celt/published/T201002/index.html|title=Bethu Brigte|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nThe ''vitae'' say that Dubthach's wife forced him to sell Brigid's mother to a druid when she became pregnant. Brigid herself was born into slavery. Legends of her early holiness include her vomiting when the druid tried to feed her, due to his impurity; a white cow with red ears appeared to sustain her instead.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\nAs she grew older, Brigid performed miracles, including healing and feeding the poor. According to one tale, as a child, she once gave away her mother's entire store of butter. The butter was then replenished in answer to Brigid's prayers.<ref>Wallace, Martin. ''A Little Book of Celtic Saints''. Belfast. Appletree Press, 1995 {{ISBN|0-86281-456-1}}, p.13</ref> Around the age of ten, she was returned as a household servant to her father, where her habit of charity led her to donate his belongings to anyone who asked.\n\nIn two ''Lives'', Dubthach was so annoyed with her that he took her in a chariot to [[Crimthann mac \u00c9nnai|the King of Leinster]] to sell her. While Dubthach was talking to the king, Brigid gave away his jewelled sword to a beggar to barter it for food to feed his family.

It has often been said that she gave canonical jurisdiction to Conleth, [[Bishop of Kildare]], but Archbishop Healy says that she simply \"selected the person to whom the Church gave this jurisdiction\", and her biographer tells us that she chose Saint Conleth \"to govern the church along with herself\". For centuries, Kildare was ruled by a double line of abbot-bishops and of abbesses, the Abbess of Kildare being regarded as [[superior general]] of the monasteries in Ireland.<ref name=catholic/> Her successors have always been accorded episcopal honour.<ref>Edward Sellnor, ''Wisdom of the Celtic Saints'' (Ave Maria Press, 1993)</ref> Brigid's oratory at Kildare became a centre of religion and learning, and developed into a cathedral city.<ref name=catholic/>\n\nBrigid is credited with founding a school of art, including metalwork and illumination, which Conleth oversaw. The Kildare scriptorium made the [[Book of Kildare]], which drew high praise from [[Gerald of Wales]] (Giraldus Cambrensis), but disappeared during the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]. According to Giraldus, nothing that he ever saw was at all comparable to the book, every page of which was gorgeously illuminated, and the interlaced work and the harmony of the colours left the impression that \"all this is the work of angelic, and not human skill\".<ref name=catholic/>\n\nAccording to the ''[[Trias Thaumaturga]]'' Brigid spent time in Connacht and founded many churches in the Diocese of Elphin. She is said to have visited Longford, Tipperary, Limerick, and South Leinster.<ref name=Joyce/> Her friendship with Saint Patrick is noted in the following paragraph from the [[Book of Armagh]]: ''\"inter sanctum Patricium Brigitanque Hibernesium columpnas amicitia caritatis inerat tanta, ut unum cor consiliumque haberent unum.

However, recognising her spiritual peril, she prayed for guidance, then placed burning embers in her shoes and put them on. \u201cThus, by fire,\u201dUltan wrote, \u201cshe put out fire, and by pain extinguished pain.\u201d<ref>{{cite journal |title=Darlugdach |journal=Dictionary of National Biography |date=1888 |volume=14 |page=63 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hSwJAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA63&lpg=PA63&dq=she+put+out+fire,+and+by+pain+extinguished+pain.&source=bl&ots=-p4oWc4v9p&sig=ACfU3U162RWPDufxStWArN2kvJf1DdDnSA&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj3ku6j4fbfAhXii60KHQ_lAzcQ6AEwC3oECAcQAQ#v=onepage&q=she%20put%20out%20fire%2C%20and%20by%20pain%20extinguished%20pain.&f=false |accessdate=18 January 2019}}</ref> She then returned to bed. Brigid feigned sleep, but was aware of Darlugdach's departure. The next day, Darlugdach revealed to Brigid the experience of the night before. Brigid reassured her that she was \u201cnow safe from the fire of passion and the fire of hell hereafter\u201d<ref>{{cite journal |title=Darlugdach}}</ref> and then healed her student's feet. So devoted was the student to her teacher that when Brigid lay dying Darlugdach expressed the wish to die with her, but Brigid replied that Darlugdach should die on the anniversary of her (Brigid's) death.\n\nSt Brigid is said to have been given the [[last rites]] by St Ninnidh when she was dying. Afterwards, he reportedly had his right hand encased in metal so that it would never be defiled, and became known as \"Ninnidh of the Clean Hand\".<ref name=catholic/> Tradition says she died at Kildare on 1 February 525.<ref name=sisters>[http://www.brigidine.org.au/about-us/index.cfm?loadref=13 ''Our Patroness'', Brigidine Sisters] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150202194641/http://www.brigidine.org.au/about-us/index.cfm?loadref=13 |date=2 February 2015 }}</ref>\n\nUpon St Brigid's death, Darlugdach became the second abbess of Kildare. Brigid's prediction has traditionally been considered to have been realized inasmuch as the [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic Church]] records Darlugdach's date of death as 522 and Brigid's as 521 and has assigned 1 February as the [[Calendar of saints|feast day]] of both saints.<ref>{{cite book|editor-last1=Olden|editor-first1=Thomas|title=Dictionary of National Biography, 1885-1900, Vol. 14|date=1885\u20131900|publisher=Smith & Elder|location=London|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Darlugdach_(DNB00)|accessdate=16 July 2017}}</ref> (The name Darlugdach (also spelled Dar Lugdach, Dar Lugdacha, or Dar Lughdacha) means \"daughter of the god [[Lugh]]\".)<ref>Wright, p.41</ref>\n\n==Miracles associated with Brigid==\nBrigid is celebrated for her generosity to the poor. In her case, most of the miracles associated with her relate to healing and household tasks usually attributed to women.\n\n*Brigid, who had a reputation as an expert dairywoman and brewer, was reputed to turn water into beer.<ref name=Bitel/> \n*The prayers of Saint Brigid were said to still the wind and the rain.<ref>[http://irishamerica.com/2018/01/wild-irish-women-saint-brigid-mary-of-the-gaels/ Rogers, Rosemary. \"Wild Irish Women: Saint Brigid\u2014Mary of the Gaels\", ''Irish American'', February/March 2018]</ref> \n*When Brigid was of marital age, a man by the name of [[Dubthach maccu Lugair]] came to woo her. Since Brigid had offered her virginity to God, she told the man that she could not accept him but that he should go to the woods behind his house where he would find a beautiful maiden to marry. Everything that he said to the maiden's parents would be pleasing to them. The man followed her instructions and it was as she said.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n*In one story, Brigid protected a woman from a nobleman who had entrusted a silver brooch to the woman for safekeeping but then secretly had thrown it into the sea. He charged her with stealing it, knowing that he could take her as a slave if a judge ruled in his favour. The woman fled and sought refuge with Brigid's community. By chance, one of her fishermen hauled in a fish which, when cut open, proved to have swallowed the brooch. The nobleman freed the woman, confessed his sin, and bowed in submission to Brigid.<ref name=Bitel/> A similar story is told of [[Saint Mungo]].\n*On an occasion when Brigid was travelling to see a doctor for a headache, she stayed at the house of a Leinster couple who had two mute daughters. The daughters were travelling with Brigid when her horse startled, causing her to fall and graze her head on a stone. A touch of Brigid's blood healed the girls of their muteness.<ref name=Bitel/>\n*When on the bank of the [[River Inny, Westmeath|River Inny]], Brigid was given a gift of apples and sweet sloes. She later entered a house where many lepers begged her for these apples, which she offered willingly. The woman who had given the gift to Brigid was angered by this, saying that she had not given the gift to the lepers. Brigid was angry at the nun for withholding from the lepers and cursed her trees so they would no longer bear fruit.  Yet another woman also gave Brigid the same gift, and again Brigid gave them to begging lepers. This woman asked that she and her garden be blessed. Brigid then said that a large tree in the virgin's garden would have twofold fruit from its offshoots, and this was done.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n*One of the more commonly told stories is of Brigid asking the King of Leinster for land. She told the king that the place where she stood was the perfect spot for a convent. It was beside a forest where the members could collect firewood and berries, there was a lake nearby that would provide water and the land was fertile. The king laughed at her and refused to give her any land. Brigid prayed and asked God to soften the king's heart. Then she smiled at the king and said, \"Will you give me as much land as my cloak will cover?\" The king thought that she was joking and agreed. She told four of her sisters to take up the cloak, but instead of laying it flat on the turf, each sister, with face turned to a different point of the compass, began to run swiftly, the cloth growing in all directions. The cloak began to cover many acres of land. \"Oh, Brigid!\" said the frighted king, \"what are you about?\" \"I am, or rather my cloak is about covering your whole province to punish you for your stinginess to the poor.\" \"Call your maidens back. I will give you a decent plot of ground.\" The saint was persuaded, and if the king held his purse-strings tight in future, she had only to allude to her cloak to bring him to reason. Soon afterwards, the king became a Christian, began to help the poor and commissioned the building of the convent. Legend has it, the convent was known for making jam from the local blueberries which was sought for all over Ireland. A new tradition is to eat jam on 1 February in honour of this miracle.<ref>[http://www.stbrigid.ie/content/story-st-brigid Story of St. Brigid, November 14, 2012] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130127102537/http://www.stbrigid.ie/content/story-st-brigid |date=27 January 2013 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.libraryireland.com/LegendaryFictionsIrishCelts/V-12-1.php/ Kennedy, Patrick.

When she was outside carrying a load past a group of poor people, some began to laugh at her. A man named Bacene said to her, \"The beautiful eye which is in your head will be betrothed to a man though you like it or not.\" In response, Brigid thrust her finger in her eye and said, \"Here is that beautiful eye for you. I deem it unlikely that anyone will ask you for a blind girl.\" Her brothers tried to save her and wash away the blood from her wound, but there was no water to be found. Brigid said to them, \"Put my staff about this sod in front of you\", and after they did, a stream came forth from the ground. Then she said to Bacene, \"Soon your two eyes will burst in your head\", and it happened as she said.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n*She is associated with the preservation of a nun's chastity in unusual circumstances.

The Cardinal wrote about the circumstances in which he obtained the tooth in a letter to the Rev.Mother of this Convent dated 13 March 1906:\n{{quote|I went all the way to Cologne on my return from Rome in 1884, on my appointment of Archbishop of Sydney to secure a portion of the precious relic of St. Brigid preserved there for over a thousand years. It is venerated at present in the Parochial Church of St. Martin to which in olden times was attached a famous Irish monastery\u2026.. The relic is, if I remember aright, a tooth of the Saint. At Cologne I found great difficulty in securing a portion of this relic. It was at first peremptorily refused. The Pastor of St. Martin\u2019s declared that his parishioners would be at once in revolt if they heard that their great parochial treasure was being interfered with. I then had to invoke the aid of an influential Canon of the [[Cologne Cathedral|Cathedral of Cologne]], whom I had assisted in some of his literary pursuits and he set his heart on procuring the coveted relic. One of his arguments was somewhat amusing: It was the first time that an Irish Archbishop of the remote See of Sydney had solicited a favour from Cologne. It was the new Christian world appealing to the old for a share of its sacred wealth. At all events our pleading was successful and, and I bore away with me a portion of the bone, duly authenticated, which is now the privilege of you good Sisters to guard and venerate\u2026.<ref>Atherton, D.

Early hagiographers portray Brigid's life and ministry as touched with fire. According to [[Patrick Weston Joyce]], tradition holds that nuns at her monastery kept an eternal flame burning there.<ref name=Joyce>[http://www.libraryireland.com/Wonders/St-Brigit-1.php/ Joyce, P. W., ''The Wonders of Ireland'', 1911]</ref> Leitmotifs, some of them borrowed from the [[apocrypha]] such as the story where she hangs her cloak on a sunbeam, are associated with the wonder tales of her hagiography and folklore. In her ''Lives'', Brigid is portrayed as having the power to multiply such things as butter, bacon and milk, to bestow sheep and cattle and to control the weather.\n\nPlant motifs associated with St Brigid include the white ''[[Lilium candidum]]'' popularly known since medieval times as the Madonna Lily for its association with the [[Virgin Mary]], and the Windflower ''[[Anemone coronaria]]'', called the \"Brigid anemone\"  since the early 19th century. Kildare, the church of the oak ''[[Quercus petraea]]'', is associated with a tree sacred to the [[Druid#Irish literature and law codes|druids]]. The colour associated with Brigid is white, worn not only by the Kildare [[United Irishmen]] during the [[1798 rebellion]], but also by [[Kildare GAA|Kildare sports teams]] in more recent times.\n\n===Placenames===\n[[File:Gross stmartin brigida von kildare.jpg|thumb|Brigida von Kildare, Gross St Martin, K\u00f6ln]]\n* Kilbride (\"Church of Brigid\") is one of Ireland's most widely found placenames, there are 43 Kilbrides located in 19 of Ireland's 32 counties:  Antrim (2), Carlow, Cavan, Down, Dublin, Galway, Kildare, Kilkenny (3), Laois, Longford, Louth, Mayo (5), Meath (4), Offaly (4), Roscommon (2), Waterford, Westmeath (2), Wexford (4), and Wicklow (8) as well as two Kilbreedys in Tipperary, Kilbreedia and Toberbreeda in Clare, Toberbreedia in Kilkenny, Brideswell Commons in Dublin, Bridestown and Templebreedy in Cork and Rathbride and Brideschurch in Kildare.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.logainm.ie/|title=logainm.ie|work=logainm.ie}}</ref> A number of placenames are derived from ''Cnoic Bhr\u00edde'' (\"Brigid's Hill\"), such as [[Knockbridge]] in Louth and [[Knockbride]] in Cavan. \n* In Wales, the villages of [[Llansanffraid Glan Conwy]], [[Llansantffraid-ym-Mechain]], [[Llansantffraed]] and [[Llansantffraid, Ceredigion]] are named after her; \"llan\" meaning \"church of\" and \"Ffraid\" or \"Ffraed\" being the Welsh for \"Bride\".{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n* In Scotland, East Kilbride and West Kilbride are called after Brigid.

They carry a hay-stuffed ''Br\u00edde\u00f3g'' doll with them to ensure evil spirits are kept away from humans and animals for the coming year. The Biddy heritage is a mixture of Christianity (St Bridgid) and ancient Celtic traditions ([[Imbolc]]). Imbolc is one of the four Celtic festivals, along with L\u00e1 Bealtaine (Mayday), Lughnasa (1 August) and Samhain (1 November).<ref>Consid\u00e8re-Charon, M.-C., Laplace, P., & Savaric, M., eds., ''The Irish Celebrating: Festive and Tragic Overtones'' (Cambridge: Cambridge Scholars Publishing, 2008), [https://books.google.com/books?id=nawYBwAAQBAJ&pg=PA2#v=onepage&q&f=false p. 2].</ref>{{rp|2}}\nTraditionally, a visit from the Biddy guaranteed good luck, fertility, prosperity and to not receive a visit was considered a slight.
