While Hinglaj is her main temple, temples dedicated to her exist in neighbouring Indian states [[Gujarat]] and [[Rajasthan]].{{Sfn| Dalal |2011|pp=158-9}} The shrine is known as Hingula, Hingalaja, Hinglaja, and Hingulata in Hindu scriptures, particularly in Sanskrit.{{Sfn| Sircar| 1998|p=113}} The goddess is known as Hinglaj Mata (the Mother Hinglaj), Hinglaj Devi (the Goddess Hinglaj), Hingula Devi (the red goddess or the Goddess of Hingula){{Sfn| Kapoor|2002|pp=2988-90}} and Kottari or Kotavi.{{Sfn| Sircar| 1998|p=43}}\n\nThe chief legend of Hinglaj Mata relates to the creation of the Shakti Peethas.[[Sati (goddess)|Sati]],daughter of ''[[Prajapati]]'' [[Daksha]],  was married to the god [[Shiva]] against his wishes. Daksha organized a great [[Daksha yajna|yajna]] but did not invite Sati and Shiva. Uninvited, Sati reached the yajna-site, where Daksha ignored Sati and vilified Shiva. Unable to withstand this insult, Sati immolated herself activating her [[Chakras]], (energy generated through her anger).\n\nSati died, but her corpse did not burn. Shiva (as [[Virabhadra]]) slew Daksha for being responsible for Sati's death and forgave him, resurrecting him. The wild, grief-stricken Shiva wandered the universe with Sati's corpse. Finally, the god [[Vishnu]] dismembered the body of Sati into 108 parts, from which 52 fell on earth and others on other planets in the universe which became [[Shakti Peethas]], temple to a form of the Goddess.\n\nShiva is also worshiped at each Shakti Pitha in the form of [[Bhairava]], the male counterpart or guardian of the presiding goddess of the Pitha.<ref name=\"Jones 2007\">{{cite book|last1= Jones |first1= Constance |last2= Ryan|first2= James D.|title= Encyclopedia of Hinduism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OgMmceadQ3gC&pg=PA545|accessdate=14 November 2012|year=2007|publisher= Infobase Publishing |isbn=9780816075645|pages=401\u2013402}}</ref> The head of Sati is believed to have fallen at Hinglaj.<ref name=Park/><ref name=Pilgrim/>{{Sfn| Dalal |2011|pp=158-9}}\n===In Other Scriptures===\nThe ''Kularnava Tantra'' mentions 18 Pithas and mentions Hingula as the third one. In the ''Kubjika Tantra'', Hingula is listed among the 42 Shakta or Siddha Pithas in which Hinglaj is at the fifth place.{{Sfn| Sircar |1998|pp=18-19}} The ''Pithanirnaya'' or ''Mahapithanirupana'' section from the ''Tantrachudamani'' originally listed 43 names, but names were added over time making it 51 Pithas. It details the ''Pitha-devata'' or ''Devi'' (name of goddess at the Pitha), the ''Kshastradishas'' (Bhairava) and the ''anga-pratyanga'' (limbs including ornaments of Sati). Hingula or Hingulata is the first in list, with the ''anga-pratyanga'' being ''Brahmarandhra'' (a [[Suture (anatomy)|suture]] in the [[Crown (anatomy)|crown]] of the head). The Devi is known by several names such as Kottari, Kottavi, Kottarisha, and the Bhairava is Bhimalochana.{{Sfn| Sircar |1998|p=35}}  In the ''Shivasharitha'', Hingula is again the first in a list of 55 Pithas. ''Brahmarandhra'' is the ''anga-pratyanga'', the goddess is called Kottari and the Bhairava is Bhimalochana (located in [[Koteshwar, Kutch|Koteshwar]]).{{Sfn| Sircar |1998|p=39}}\n\nIn the non-scripture 16th century Bengali work ''[[Chandimangal]]'', Mukundaram lists nine Pithas in the ''Daksha-yajna-bhanga'' section. Hinglaja is the last Pitha described to be the place where Sati's navel fell.{{Sfn| Sircar| 1998|pp=32-3}}\n\nAnother legend is that [[Devi]] killed Hingol as he tormented the people.She followed Hingol to the cave, which is currently the Hinglaj Mata shrine. Before he was killed, Hingol requested the goddess to name the place after him, which she granted.{{Sfn| Dalal |2011|pp=158-9}}\n===Belief of Brahmakshatriyas===\n[[File:Hinglaj.jpg|thumb|Picture of Hinglaj Mata protecting Brahmakshatriyas from [[Parashurama]]]]\nThe [[Brahmakshatriya]] venerate Hinglaj Mata as their [[Kuladevata|family deity]].They believe that when the god [[Parashurama]] was persecuting [[kshatriya]]s (the warrior caste), some [[Brahmin]]s (priest caste) provided protection to 12 kshatriyas and disguised them as Brahmins, and they were protected by Hinglaj Mata.Another variation of the tale is that the sage [[Dadhichi]] provided protection to Ratnasena, a king ruling in [[Sind]], in his [[ashram]] (hermitage). However, Parashurama killed him when he ventured out. His sons remained in the ashram. When Parashurama visited the ashram, they were disguised as Brahmins. One of them, Jayasena, returned to Sind to rule the kingdom, armed with a protective [[mantra]] of Hinglaj Mata, given by Dadhici. Hinglaj Mata protected Jayasena and ordered Parshurama to end his killing spree.{{Sfn| Dalal |2011|pp=158-9}}\n\n===Belief as Kuldevi===\nAs per the popular folklore of [[Treta Yuga]], a virtuous [[Haihaya]] king of [[Mahishmati]] of [[Malwa]] region, Sahastrabahu Arjuna or Sahastararjun, more widely known as [[Kartavirya Arjuna]] drunk with power and sense of invincibility ends up killing the great [[Brahman]] sage [[Jamadagni]] over a sacred cow [[Kamadhenu]]. Furious at this heinous crime, son of Jamadagni, Lord [[Parashurama]] vows to vanquish the power-drunk [[Kshatriya]] clan from Earth. Wielding his divine AXE, he eliminates Sahastararjun and later on he rages on earth 21 times, each time decimating unvirtuous and unworthy kings wherever he went.\n\nTerrified with the prospect of death at Lord Parashuram, the progeny of Sahastararjun seek [[Janaka]] Maharaj, one of the most learned king of [[Videha]] who advises them to seek Hinglaji Mata's blessing. The clan devotedly pray to Devi at Higloj who is overcome with compassion and assures shelter in her place. Over time, when Lord Parashuram visits this place, he was pleasantly surprised to see Kshatriya clan involved in many Brahminical activities having shed their arms. Hinglaj Mata intervenes on their behalf, and since then the clan disowned arms. Lord Parashuram not only taught them scriptures and Vedas, but also weaving for a living. The clan with a sense of relief then branches out and spread across [[Sindh]], [[Panjab]], [[Rajasthan]], [[Madhya Pradesh]], and later on to South India, such as [[Telangana]], [[Andrapradesh]] and [[Karnataka]]. And where ever they went they continued worshiping Hinglaj Devi. [[Bhavsar|Bhavasars]], [[Barot (caste)]], Shimpis and [[Khatri]]s of Somavaunsha Sahasrarjun Kshatriya trace their origin to this clan. Some of those who remained in Sindh province later on converted to Islam. Of note, even to they are one of the oldest non-Brahmin clans who had knowledge of Vedas.

Rama follows the advice and immediately leaves with his army for Hinglaj. [[Sita]], [[Lakshmana]], and [[Hanuman]] also accompany him. At the mountain pass, the Goddess\u2019s \narmy, which guards the entry to her empire(Sacred Valley of Hinglaj) stopped them and a war broke out between them in which goddess's army defeated Ram's army and told his army must retreat. When Rama sends a mes-\nsenger to the Goddess to inquire why she fought him, she responds that he \nmust return to his first stop, which is now called '''Ram Bagh''', and make the journey again as a \nsimple pilgrim. So Rama leaves his entourage, his army, and vehicles behind \nand sets out to walk to the shrine, accompanied only by his closest friends. \nRama\u2019s men are devastated at not being allowed to accompany their lord to the \nGoddess\u2019s abode. The Devi thus promises them that their descendants will, at \nsome point in time, all come back to do the pilgrimage. For guidance through \nthe harsh desert, Rama calls on the pious Lalu Jasraj, a hermit who resides \nnearby at some hot springs, to be their charidar for the yatra. Only now does the Goddess allow the group to cross the pass.After only a few kilometers, Sita becomes \nthirsty in the burning desert heat and requests that Hanuman and Lakshmana \nbring her water. Hanuman tries to extract water from the soil by stomping his \nfoot violently on the ground, but this produces only a dry riverbed. With the \nsame aim, Lakshmana shoots an arrow into the mountain range but only suc-\nceeds in detaching one of the hills.

The \ndam would have flooded the accommodation roads to the temple and endangered the locality and its associated festivals.Following protest from the Hindu community the dam proposal was abandoned by the [[Balochistan Assembly]].\n\nSo the Water and Power Development Authority of Pakistan(WAPDS) initially suggested relocating three holy places to a higher elevation and guaranteed the \nconstruction of a new access road.This proposition was rejected by the '''Hinglaj Sheva Mandali(HSM)''', which argued that these sites were not like common temples and could not simply be relocated. In 2008, the lawmakers in the \nBalochistan Assembly reacted to the concerns and protests of the Hindu community and asked the federal government to stop the project. In 2009, \nafter a year of suspension, the WAPDA chose to continue with the controversial [[Hingol Dam]] construction plans but decided to shift the site of the dam a few kilometers north in order to protect the temple. This resolution was in keeping with a consensus between the WAPDA, the Balochistan Assembly, and the Hindu community. <ref>http://40.114.28.106/PDF/5322-pdf-VNV/p2/9780190850531.PDF</ref>\n\n==Kuldevi==\nHinglaj Devi worshiped as [[Kuldevi]] of  Bhawsar (Bhavsar), Gosavi, Goswami (Dashnami), Brhamkshatriya samaj (Hindu Khatri), Barot (caste), Bavaliya (mer) (Samaj of Saurastra Gujarat), in south India Especially Banjaras  or Lambadi's Community Worship Hingalaj Devi as one of the Sathi Bhavani.

While Hinglaj is her main temple, temples dedicated to her exist in neighbouring Indian states [[Gujarat]] and [[Rajasthan]].{{Sfn| Dalal |2011|pp=158-9}} The shrine is known as Hingula, Hingalaja, Hinglaja, and Hingulata in Hindu scriptures, particularly in Sanskrit.{{Sfn| Sircar| 1998|p=113}} The goddess is known as Hinglaj Mata (the Mother Hinglaj), Hinglaj Devi (the Goddess Hinglaj), Hingula Devi (the red goddess or the Goddess of Hingula){{Sfn| Kapoor|2002|pp=2988-90}} and Kottari or Kotavi.{{Sfn| Sircar| 1998|p=43}}\n\nThe chief legend of Hinglaj Mata relates to the creation of the Shakti Peethas.[[Sati (goddess)|Sati]],daughter of ''[[Prajapati]]'' [[Daksha]],  was married to the god [[Shiva]] against his wishes. Daksha organized a great [[Daksha yajna|yajna]] but did not invite Sati and Shiva. Uninvited, Sati reached the yajna-site, where Daksha ignored Sati and vilified Shiva. Unable to withstand this insult, Sati immolated herself activating her [[Chakras]], (energy generated through her anger).\n\nSati died, but her corpse did not burn. Shiva (as [[Virabhadra]]) slew Daksha for being responsible for Sati's death and forgave him, resurrecting him. The wild, grief-stricken Shiva wandered the universe with Sati's corpse. Finally, the god [[Vishnu]] dismembered the body of Sati into 108 parts, from which 52 fell on earth and others on other planets in the universe which became [[Shakti Peethas]], temple to a form of the Goddess.\n\nShiva is also worshiped at each Shakti Pitha in the form of [[Bhairava]], the male counterpart or guardian of the presiding goddess of the Pitha.<ref name=\"Jones 2007\">{{cite book|last1= Jones |first1= Constance |last2= Ryan|first2= James D.|title= Encyclopedia of Hinduism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OgMmceadQ3gC&pg=PA545|accessdate=14 November 2012|year=2007|publisher= Infobase Publishing |isbn=9780816075645|pages=401\u2013402}}</ref> The head of Sati is believed to have fallen at Hinglaj.<ref name=Park/><ref name=Pilgrim/>{{Sfn| Dalal |2011|pp=158-9}}\n===In Other Scriptures===\nThe ''Kularnava Tantra'' mentions 18 Pithas and mentions Hingula as the third one. In the ''Kubjika Tantra'', Hingula is listed among the 42 Shakta or Siddha Pithas in which Hinglaj is at the fifth place.{{Sfn| Sircar |1998|pp=18-19}} The ''Pithanirnaya'' or ''Mahapithanirupana'' section from the ''Tantrachudamani'' originally listed 43 names, but names were added over time making it 51 Pithas. It details the ''Pitha-devata'' or ''Devi'' (name of goddess at the Pitha), the ''Kshastradishas'' (Bhairava) and the ''anga-pratyanga'' (limbs including ornaments of Sati). Hingula or Hingulata is the first in list, with the ''anga-pratyanga'' being ''Brahmarandhra'' (a [[Suture (anatomy)|suture]] in the [[Crown (anatomy)|crown]] of the head). The Devi is known by several names such as Kottari, Kottavi, Kottarisha, and the Bhairava is Bhimalochana.{{Sfn| Sircar |1998|p=35}}  In the ''Shivasharitha'', Hingula is again the first in a list of 55 Pithas. ''Brahmarandhra'' is the ''anga-pratyanga'', the goddess is called Kottari and the Bhairava is Bhimalochana (located in [[Koteshwar, Kutch|Koteshwar]]).{{Sfn| Sircar |1998|p=39}}\n\nIn the non-scripture 16th century Bengali work ''[[Chandimangal]]'', Mukundaram lists nine Pithas in the ''Daksha-yajna-bhanga'' section. Hinglaja is the last Pitha described to be the place where Sati's navel fell.{{Sfn| Sircar| 1998|pp=32-3}}\n\nAnother legend is that [[Devi]] killed Hingol as he tormented the people.She followed Hingol to the cave, which is currently the Hinglaj Mata shrine. Before he was killed, Hingol requested the goddess to name the place after him, which she granted.{{Sfn| Dalal |2011|pp=158-9}}\n===Belief of Brahmakshatriyas===\n[[File:Hinglaj.jpg|thumb|Picture of Hinglaj Mata protecting Brahmakshatriyas from [[Parashurama]]]]\nThe [[Brahmakshatriya]] venerate Hinglaj Mata as their [[Kuladevata|family deity]].They believe that when the god [[Parashurama]] was persecuting [[kshatriya]]s (the warrior caste), some [[Brahmin]]s (priest caste) provided protection to 12 kshatriyas and disguised them as Brahmins, and they were protected by Hinglaj Mata.Another variation of the tale is that the sage [[Dadhichi]] provided protection to Ratnasena, a king ruling in [[Sind]], in his [[ashram]] (hermitage). However, Parashurama killed him when he ventured out. His sons remained in the ashram. When Parashurama visited the ashram, they were disguised as Brahmins. One of them, Jayasena, returned to Sind to rule the kingdom, armed with a protective [[mantra]] of Hinglaj Mata, given by Dadhici. Hinglaj Mata protected Jayasena and ordered Parshurama to end his killing spree.{{Sfn| Dalal |2011|pp=158-9}}\n\n===Belief as Kuldevi===\nAs per the popular folklore of [[Treta Yuga]], a virtuous [[Haihaya]] king of [[Mahishmati]] of [[Malwa]] region, Sahastrabahu Arjuna or Sahastararjun, more widely known as [[Kartavirya Arjuna]] drunk with power and sense of invincibility ends up killing the great [[Brahman]] sage [[Jamadagni]] over a sacred cow [[Kamadhenu]]. Furious at this heinous crime, son of Jamadagni, Lord [[Parashurama]] vows to vanquish the power-drunk [[Kshatriya]] clan from Earth. Wielding his divine AXE, he eliminates Sahastararjun and later on he rages on earth 21 times, each time decimating unvirtuous and unworthy kings wherever he went.\n\nTerrified with the prospect of death at Lord Parashuram, the progeny of Sahastararjun seek [[Janaka]] Maharaj, one of the most learned king of [[Videha]] who advises them to seek Hinglaji Mata's blessing. The clan devotedly pray to Devi at Higloj who is overcome with compassion and assures shelter in her place. Over time, when Lord Parashuram visits this place, he was pleasantly surprised to see Kshatriya clan involved in many Brahminical activities having shed their arms. Hinglaj Mata intervenes on their behalf, and since then the clan disowned arms. Lord Parashuram not only taught them scriptures and Vedas, but also weaving for a living. The clan with a sense of relief then branches out and spread across [[Sindh]], [[Panjab]], [[Rajasthan]], [[Madhya Pradesh]], and later on to South India, such as [[Telangana]], [[Andrapradesh]] and [[Karnataka]]. And where ever they went they continued worshiping Hinglaj Devi. [[Bhavsar|Bhavasars]], [[Barot (caste)]], Shimpis and [[Khatri]]s of Somavaunsha Sahasrarjun Kshatriya trace their origin to this clan. Some of those who remained in Sindh province later on converted to Islam. Of note, even to they are one of the oldest non-Brahmin clans who had knowledge of Vedas.

Here the concept of svaya\u1e43bh\u016b not only relates \nto the major shrine but also can be linked to whole areas of the Hinglaj Valley, the area surrounding [[Chandragup|Chandragup volcano]], or even the whole \ndesert is considered the home of the Devi.<ref>http://40.114.28.106/PDF/5322-pdf-VNV/p2/9780190850531.PDF</ref> \n\nThe  point at which the Hinglaj Valley begins is clearly marked by a \nwall built by the Hinglaj Sheva Mandali(HSM) in 1996. However, traditional travelogues and of \npilgrims coming to the shrine generally demonstrate that the Goddess\u2019s sacred geography more extended than this, the disappearance of the old pilgrimage \npaths led to the elimination of many stops en route.Due to the divinity of the Goddess\u2019s sacred geography commercial activities including shops and teastalls are not allowed to be set up in the valley.<ref>http://40.114.28.106/PDF/5322-pdf-VNV/p2/9780190850531.PDF</ref>\n\n==Lord Ram's pilgrimage to Hinglaj==\n[[File:Nanimandir - panoramio.jpg|thumb|Hinglaj Mata Mandir Cave entrance]]\nAfter killing [[Ravana]],\nexile [[Rama]] returns from exile to ascend to the throne of [[Ayodhya]].A sage  Kumbodhar explains that to cleanse himself of this sin, Rama should make a pilgrimage to Hinglaj Mata, the only place that can purify him. Rama follows the advice and immediately leaves with his army for Hinglaj. [[Sita]], [[Lakshmana]], and [[Hanuman]] also accompany him. At the mountain pass, the Goddess\u2019s \narmy, which guards the entry to her empire(Sacred Valley of Hinglaj) stopped them and a war broke out between them in which goddess's army defeated Ram's army and told his army must retreat. When Rama sends a mes-\nsenger to the Goddess to inquire why she fought him, she responds that he \nmust return to his first stop, which is now called '''Ram Bagh''', and make the journey again as a \nsimple pilgrim. So Rama leaves his entourage, his army, and vehicles behind \nand sets out to walk to the shrine, accompanied only by his closest friends. \nRama\u2019s men are devastated at not being allowed to accompany their lord to the \nGoddess\u2019s abode. The Devi thus promises them that their descendants will, at \nsome point in time, all come back to do the pilgrimage. For guidance through \nthe harsh desert, Rama calls on the pious Lalu Jasraj, a hermit who resides \nnearby at some hot springs, to be their charidar for the yatra. Only now does the Goddess allow the group to cross the pass.After only a few kilometers, Sita becomes \nthirsty in the burning desert heat and requests that Hanuman and Lakshmana \nbring her water. Hanuman tries to extract water from the soil by stomping his \nfoot violently on the ground, but this produces only a dry riverbed. With the \nsame aim, Lakshmana shoots an arrow into the mountain range but only suc-\nceeds in detaching one of the hills. In agony, Sita places her palm down on the \nsoil and thereby makes five wells appear, from which the group drinks.These five wells are known as '''Seeta Koowas'''. The river followed by a series of five wells reportedly produced either by the power of Sita or by Hinglaj herself.But any of these \nlandmarks are not seen today.After a physically challenging journey, Rama reaches the shrine of the Goddess, and \nthe Devi grants him purification of his sin. To mark his completed y\u0101tr\u0101, he \ncarves '''the symbols of the sun and moon on the mountain opposite the temple''' which can be seen even today.<ref>http://40.114.28.106/PDF/5322-pdf-VNV/p2/9780190850531.PDF</ref>\n\nHinglaj pilgrims before going to Hinglaj goes to Khari Nadi, where people take a bath in the ocean and worship\u00a0Rama.<ref>http://40.114.28.106/PDF/5322-pdf-VNV/p2/9780190850531.PDF</ref>\n\n==Hinglaj Sheva Mandali==\nThe '''Hinglaj Sheva Mandali (HSM)''' is the temple committee established to promote an annual pilgrimage to the shrine.It was created on January 5, 1986 and continues to be the main organization serving the Hinglaj Mata temple and its pilgrims.<ref>http://40.114.28.106/PDF/5322-pdf-VNV/p2/9780190850531.PDF</ref> \n==Controversy==\n===Kidnapping of temple committee chairman===\nThe chairman of the temple committee was kidnapped two days before the annual Hinglaj Yatra in 2012 by suspected Islamists<ref>https://tribune.com.pk/story/361740/conspiracy-theory-maharaj-kidnapped-two-days-before-hinglaj-pilgrimage/?amp=1</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=https://hinduexistence.org/2012/04/10/hinglaj-shrine-committee-chairman-abducted-in-pakistan-by-suspected-islamists/ |title = Hinglaj Shrine committee chairman abducted in Pakistan by suspected Islamists|date = 2012-04-09}}</ref>He was kept in captivity for 73 days and later released.The [[Pakistan Hindu Council]] strongly criticised that his kidnapping was to warn the Hindus residing in Pakistan.<ref>https://tribune.com.pk/story/396375/hinglaj-mata-chairperson-recovered-after-two-and-a-half-months/?amp=1</ref>\n\n===Dam Construction===\nIn 2008, Water and Power Development Authority of Pakistan (WAPDA)  proposed a plan to build a dam in the Hingol River close to the shrine. The \ndam would have flooded the accommodation roads to the temple and endangered the locality and its associated festivals.Following protest from the Hindu community the dam proposal was abandoned by the [[Balochistan Assembly]].\n\nSo the Water and Power Development Authority of Pakistan(WAPDS) initially suggested relocating three holy places to a higher elevation and guaranteed the \nconstruction of a new access road.This proposition was rejected by the '''Hinglaj Sheva Mandali(HSM)''', which argued that these sites were not like common temples and could not simply be relocated. In 2008, the lawmakers in the \nBalochistan Assembly reacted to the concerns and protests of the Hindu community and asked the federal government to stop the project. In 2009, \nafter a year of suspension, the WAPDA chose to continue with the controversial [[Hingol Dam]] construction plans but decided to shift the site of the dam a few kilometers north in order to protect the temple. This resolution was in keeping with a consensus between the WAPDA, the Balochistan Assembly, and the Hindu community. <ref>http://40.114.28.106/PDF/5322-pdf-VNV/p2/9780190850531.PDF</ref>\n\n==Kuldevi==\nHinglaj Devi worshiped as [[Kuldevi]] of  Bhawsar (Bhavsar), Gosavi, Goswami (Dashnami), Brhamkshatriya samaj (Hindu Khatri), Barot (caste), Bavaliya (mer) (Samaj of Saurastra Gujarat), in south India Especially Banjaras  or Lambadi's Community Worship Hingalaj Devi as one of the Sathi Bhavani.
