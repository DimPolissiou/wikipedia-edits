They have become a pivotal part of our contemporary society, with most countries in the world burning fossil fuels in order to produce power.\n\nCurrently the trend has been towards renewable fuels, such as [[Renewable energy#Biofuel|biofuels]] like alcohols.\n\n==Chemical==\nChemical fuels are substances that release energy by reacting with substances around them, most notably by the process of [[combustion]]. Most of the chemical energy released in combustion was not stored in the chemical bonds of the fuel, but in the weak double bond of molecular oxygen.<ref name=\"Schmidt-Rohr 15\">{{cite journal | last1 = Schmidt-Rohr | first1 = K | year = 2015 | title = Why Combustions Are Always Exothermic, Yielding About 418 kJ per Mole of O<sub>2</sub> | doi = 10.1021/acs.jchemed.5b00333 | journal = J.

First, by their physical properties, as a solid, liquid or gas. Secondly, on the basis of their occurrence: ''primary (natural fuel)'' and ''secondary (artificial fuel)''. Thus, a general classification of chemical fuels is:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:1em auto 1em auto;\"\n|+ General types of chemical fuels\n! scope=\"col\" |\n! scope=\"col\" | Primary (natural)\n! scope=\"col\" | Secondary (artificial)\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |[[Solid fuel]]s\n| [[wood]], [[coal]], [[peat]], [[Feces|dung]], etc. || [[coke (fuel)|coke]], [[charcoal]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |[[Liquid fuel]]s\n| [[petroleum]] || [[diesel fuel|diesel]], [[gasoline]], [[kerosene]], [[Liquefied petroleum gas|LPG]], [[coal tar]], [[naphtha]], [[ethanol]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |[[Gaseous fuel]]s\n| [[natural gas]] ||[[hydrogen]], [[propane]], [[methane]], [[coal gas]], [[water gas]], [[blast furnace]] gas, [[coke (fuel)|coke]] oven gas, [[CNG]]\n|}\n<!--either needs expansion or deletion<gallery>\nFile:Charcoal.jpg|[[Charcoal]]\nFile:Saterland peat digging by hand 1963.jpg|[[Peat]] digging by hand in [[Saterland]], 1963\n</gallery>-->\n\n===Solid fuel===\n{{main|Solid fuel}}\n\n[[File:Coal anthracite.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Coal is an important solid fuel]]\n\nSolid fuel refers to various types of [[solid]] material that are used as fuel to produce [[energy]] and provide [[heating]], usually released through [[combustion]]. Solid fuels include [[wood]] , [[charcoal]], [[peat]], [[coal]], [[hexamine fuel tablet]]s, and pellets made from wood (see [[wood pellets]]), [[maize|corn]], [[wheat]], [[rye]] and other [[cereal|grains]]. [[Solid-fuel rocket]] technology also uses solid fuel (see [[Rocket fuel#Solid propellants|solid propellants]]). Solid fuels have been used by humanity for many years to [[making fire|create fire]]. Coal was the fuel source which enabled the [[industrial revolution]], from firing [[furnace]]s, to running [[steam engine]]s. Wood was also extensively used to run [[steam locomotive]]s. Both peat and coal are still used in [[electricity generation]] today.\nThe use of some solid fuels (e.g. coal) is restricted or prohibited in some urban areas, due to unsafe levels of toxic emissions. The use of other solid fuels as wood is decreasing as heating technology and the availability of good quality fuel improves. In some areas, [[anthracite|smokeless coal]] is often the only solid fuel used. In Ireland, peat [[briquette]]s are used as smokeless fuel. They are also used to start a coal fire.\n\n===Liquid fuels===\n{{main|Liquid fuel}}\n\n[[File:Benzinepomp002.jpg|thumb|right|220px|A [[gasoline station]]]]\n\nLiquid fuels are combustible or energy-generating molecules that can be harnessed to create [[mechanical energy]], usually producing [[kinetic energy]]. They must also take the shape of their container; the fumes of liquid fuels are flammable, not the fluids.\n\nMost liquid fuels in widespread use are derived from the [[fossil fuels|fossilized remains]] of dead plants and animals by exposure to heat and pressure inside the Earth's crust. However, there are several types, such as [[hydrogen fuel]] (for [[automotive]] uses), [[ethanol]], [[jet fuel]] and [[bio-diesel]], which are all categorized as liquid fuels. [[Emulsified fuel]]s of oil in water, such as [[orimulsion]], have been developed as a way to make heavy oil fractions usable as liquid fuels. Many liquid fuels play a primary role in transportation and the economy.\n\nSome common properties of liquid fuels are that they are easy to transport and can be handled easily. They are also relatively easy to use for all engineering applications and in home use. Fuels like [[kerosene]] are rationed in some countries, for example in government-subsidized shops in India for home use.\n\nConventional [[diesel fuel|diesel]] is similar to [[gasoline]] in that it is a mixture of [[aliphatic hydrocarbon]]s extracted from [[petroleum]]. Kerosene is used in [[kerosene lamp]]s and as a fuel for cooking, heating, and small engines. [[Natural gas]], composed chiefly of [[methane]], can only exist as a liquid at very low temperatures (regardless of pressure), which limits its direct use as a liquid fuel in most applications. [[LP gas]] is a mixture of [[propane]] and [[butane]], both of which are easily compressible gases under standard atmospheric conditions. It offers many of the advantages of [[compressed natural gas]] (CNG) but is denser than air, does not burn as cleanly, and is much more easily compressed. Commonly used for cooking and space heating, LP gas and compressed propane are seeing increased use in motorized vehicles. Propane is the third most commonly used motor fuel globally.\n\n===Fuel gas===\n{{main|Fuel gas}}\n\n[[File:Propane tank 20lb.jpg|thumb|upright|right|A 20-pound ({{nowrap|9.1 kg}}) propane cylinder]]\n\nFuel gas is any one of a number of fuels that are [[gas]]eous under ordinary conditions. Many fuel gases are composed of [[hydrocarbons]] (such as [[methane]] or [[propane]]), [[hydrogen]], [[carbon monoxide]], or mixtures thereof. Such gases are sources of potential [[heat energy]] or [[light energy]] that can be readily transmitted and distributed through pipes from the point of origin directly to the place of consumption. Fuel gas is contrasted with [[liquid fuels]] and from [[solid fuel]]s, though some fuel gases are [[Liquefaction of gases|liquefied]] for storage or transport. While their gaseous nature can be advantageous, avoiding the difficulty of transporting solid fuel and the dangers of spillage inherent in liquid fuels, it can also be dangerous. It is possible for a fuel gas to be undetected and collect in certain areas, leading to the risk of a [[gas explosion]]. For this reason, [[odorizer]]s are added to most fuel gases so that they may be detected by a distinct smell. The most common type of fuel gas in current use is [[natural gas]].\n\n===Biofuels===\n{{main|Biofuel}}\n\n[[Biofuel]] can be broadly defined  as solid, liquid, or gas fuel consisting of, or derived from [[biomass]]. Biomass can also be used directly for heating or power\u2014known as ''biomass fuel''. Biofuel can be produced from any carbon source that can be replenished rapidly e.g. plants. Many different plants and plant-derived materials are used for biofuel manufacture.\n\nPerhaps the earliest fuel  employed by humans is wood. Evidence shows controlled fire was used up to 1.5 million years ago at [[Swartkrans]], South Africa. It is unknown which hominid species first used fire, as both ''[[Australopithecus]]'' and an early species of ''[[Homo (genus)|Homo]]'' were present at the sites.<ref>{{Cite news\n | last=Rincon | first=Paul | date=22 March 2004\n | title=Bones hint at first use of fire | publisher=[[BBC News]]\n | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/3557077.stm\n | accessdate=2007-09-11 }}</ref> As a fuel, wood has remained in use up until the present day, although it has been superseded for many purposes by other sources.

A global movement toward the generation of [[renewable energy]] is therefore under way to help meet increased energy needs. The burning of fossil fuels produces around 21.3 billion [[tonnes]] (21.3 [[gigatonne]]s) of [[carbon dioxide]] (CO<sub>2</sub>) per year, but it is estimated that natural processes can only absorb about half of that amount, so there is a net increase of 10.65 billion tonnes of atmospheric carbon dioxide per year (one tonne of atmospheric carbon is equivalent to 44/12 or 3.7 tonnes of carbon dioxide).<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.eia.doe.gov/oiaf/1605/ggccebro/chapter1.html|title=US Department of Energy on greenhouse gases|accessdate=2007-09-09}}</ref>  Carbon dioxide is one of the [[greenhouse gas]]es that enhances [[radiative forcing]] and contributes to [[global warming]], causing the [[Instrumental temperature record|average surface temperature]] of the Earth to rise in response, which [[Scientific opinion on climate change|the vast majority of climate scientists]] agree will cause major [[Effects of global warming|adverse effects]].\nFuels are a source of energy.\n\n===Energy===\nThe amount of energy from different types of fuel depends on the [[stoichiometric ratio]], the chemically correct air and fuel ratio to ensure complete combustion of fuel, and its [[specific energy]], the energy per unit mass.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|+ [[Energy capacity|Energy capacities]] of common types of fuel\n|-\n!

Technically speaking, all matter can be a nuclear fuel because any element under the right conditions will release nuclear energy,{{dubious|date=October 2016}} but the materials commonly referred to as nuclear fuels are those that will produce energy without being placed under extreme duress. Nuclear fuel is a material that can be 'burned' by [[nuclear fission]] or [[nuclear fusion|fusion]] to derive [[Nuclear power|nuclear energy]]. ''Nuclear fuel'' can refer to the fuel itself, or to physical objects (for example bundles composed of '''fuel rods''') composed of the fuel material, mixed with structural, [[neutron moderator|neutron moderating]], or neutron reflecting materials.\n\nMost nuclear fuels contain heavy [[fissile]] elements that are capable of nuclear fission.  When these fuels are struck by neutrons, they are in turn capable of emitting neutrons when they break apart.  This makes possible a self-sustaining [[chain reaction]] that releases energy with a controlled rate in a [[nuclear reactor]] or with a very rapid uncontrolled rate in a [[nuclear weapon]].\n\nThe most common fissile nuclear fuels are [[uranium-235]] (<sup>235</sup>U) and [[Pu-239|plutonium-239]] (<sup>239</sup>Pu). The actions of mining, refining, purifying, using, and ultimately disposing of nuclear fuel together make up the [[nuclear fuel cycle]]. Not all types of nuclear fuels create power from nuclear fission.  [[Plutonium-238]] and some other elements are used to produce small amounts of nuclear power by [[radioactive decay]] in [[radioisotope thermoelectric generator]]s and other types of [[atomic battery|atomic batteries]]. Also, light [[nuclide]]s such as [[tritium]] (<sup>3</sup>H) can be used as fuel for [[nuclear fusion]].\nNuclear fuel has the highest [[energy density]] of all practical fuel sources.\n\n===Fission===\n\n[[File:Nuclear fuel pellets.jpeg|thumb|[[Nuclear fuel]] pellets are used to release nuclear energy]]\n\nThe most common type of nuclear fuel used by humans is heavy [[fissile]] elements that can be made to undergo [[nuclear fission]] [[chain reaction]]s in a  [[nuclear reactor|nuclear fission reactor]]; ''nuclear fuel'' can refer to the material or to physical objects (for example fuel bundles composed of [[fuel rod]]s) composed of the fuel material, perhaps mixed with structural, [[neutron moderator|neutron moderating]], or neutron reflecting materials.  The most common fissile nuclear fuels are [[Uranium-235|<sup>235</sup>U]] and [[Pu-239|<sup>239</sup>Pu]], and the actions of mining, refining, purifying, using, and ultimately disposing of these elements together make up the [[nuclear fuel cycle]], which is important for its relevance to [[nuclear power]] generation and [[nuclear weapon]]s.\n\n===Fusion===\nFuels that produce energy by the process of [[nuclear fusion]] are currently not utilized by humans but are the main source of fuel for [[star]]s. Fusion fuels tend to be light elements such as [[hydrogen]] which will combine easily. Energy is required to start fusion by raising temperature so high all materials would turn into plasma, and allow nuclei to collide and stick together with each other before repelling due to electric charge. This process is called fusion and it can give out energy.\n\nIn stars that undergo nuclear fusion, fuel consists of [[atomic nuclei]] that can release energy by the absorption of a [[proton]] or [[neutron]]. In most stars the fuel is provided by hydrogen, which can combine to form [[helium]] through the [[proton-proton chain reaction]] or by the [[CNO cycle]]. When the hydrogen fuel is exhausted, nuclear fusion can continue with progressively heavier elements, although the net energy released is lower because of the smaller difference in nuclear binding energy. Once [[iron-56]] or [[isotopes of nickel|nickel-56]] nuclei are produced, no further energy can be obtained by nuclear fusion as these have the highest nuclear binding energies. The elements then on use up energy instead of giving off energy when fused. Therefore, fusion stops and the star dies. In attempts by humans, fusion is only carried out with hydrogen (isotope of 2 and 3) to form helium-4 as this reaction gives out the most net energy. Electric confinement ([[ITER]]), [[inertial confinement]](heating by laser) and heating by strong electric currents are the popular methods used. .<ref>{{Cite journal\n | last = Fewell | first = M.

This occurs naturally in liquids and solids. High energy density can also be provided by an [[internal combustion engine]]. These engines require clean-burning fuels. The fuels that are easiest to burn cleanly are typically liquids and gases. Thus, liquids meet the requirements of being both energy-dense and clean-burning. In addition, liquids (and gases) can be pumped, which means handling is easily mechanized, and thus less laborious.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Energy}}\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Alcohol fuel]]\n* [[Alternative fuels]]\n* [[Ammonia]]\n* [[Battery (electricity)]]\n* [[Bitumen-based fuel]]\n* [[Biofuels]]\n* [[Compressed natural gas]]\n* [[Cryogenic fuel]]\n* [[Emulsified fuel]]\n* [[Fuel card]]\n* [[Fuel cell]]\n* [[Fuel container]]\n* [[Fuel management systems]]\n* [[Fuel oil]]\n* [[Fuel poverty]]\n* [[Filling station]]\n* [[Hydrogen economy]]\n* [[Hydrogen fuel]]\n* [[Hypergolic fuel]]\n* [[Liquid fuels]]\n* [[List of energy topics]]\n* [[Marine fuel management]]\n* [[Propellant]]\n* [[Recycled fuel]]\n* [[Solid fuel]]\n* [[World energy resources and consumption]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n* {{Cite book| title = Chemistry 1 | author = Ratcliff, Brian| publisher = Cambridge University press | year= 2000 | isbn = 978-0-521-78778-9|display-authors=etal}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{Commons category|Fuels}}\n* {{cite web|url= http://ec.europa.eu/environment/co2/9994/en.pdf |title=Directive 1999/94/EC of the European Parliament and of the council of 13 December 1999, relating to the availability of consumer information on fuel economy and CO2 emissions in respect of the marketing of new passenger cars }}&nbsp;{{small|(140&nbsp;KB)}}.\n* [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31980L1268:EN:NOT Council Directive 80/1268/EEC Fuel consumption of motor vehicles].\n{{Motor fuel}}\n{{Firelighting}}\n{{Energy footer}}\n{{Fire}}\n{{Portal bar|Agriculture|Ecology|Energy|Clothing}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Fuels| ]]\n[[Category:Energy development]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Material that stores energy later extracted by use of oxidizer, catalyst, or tool, but which is not conserved}}\n{{Other uses}}\n{{pp-move-indef}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2012}}\n\n[[File:Buying fuelwood.jpeg|thumb|[[Wood]] is one of the first fuels used by [[human]]s.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Sgphv2ydAHwC&pg=PA69&dq=wood+one+of+the+first+fuels+used+by+humans#v=onepage&q=wood%20one%20of%20the%20first%20fuels%20used%20by%20humans&f=false|title=Chemistry of Fossil Fuels and Biofuels|last=Schobert|first=Harold|year=2013|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=978-0521114004|language=en}}</ref>]]\n\nA '''fuel''' is any material that can be made to react with other substances so that it releases  energy as heat energy or to be used for [[work (physics)|work]].

Other times the heat itself is valued for warmth, [[cooking]], or industrial processes, as well as the illumination that comes with [[combustion]]. Fuels are also used in the [[Cell (biology)|cells]] of [[organism]]s in a process known as [[cellular respiration]], where organic molecules are oxidized to release usable energy. [[Hydrocarbon]]s and related oxygen-containing molecules are by far the most common source of fuel used by humans, but other substances, including radioactive metals, are also utilized.\n\nFuels are contrasted with other substances or devices storing potential energy, such as those that directly release [[electrical energy]] (such as [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]] and [[capacitor]]s) or mechanical energy (such as [[flywheel]]s, springs, compressed air, or water in a reservoir).\n\n==History==\nThe first known use of fuel was the combustion of wood or sticks by ''[[Homo erectus]]'' nearly two million years ago.<ref>{{cite book| title = Origin of Humankind | author = [[Richard Leakey|Leakey, Richard]] | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=75-cwH1905QC&pg=PR9&dq=%22first+use+of+Fire%22 | year = 1994 | publisher = [[Basic Books]] | isbn = 978-0-465-03135-1}}</ref>{{Page needed|date=September 2010}} Throughout most of human history only fuels derived from plants or animal fat were used by humans.

They have become a pivotal part of our contemporary society, with most countries in the world burning fossil fuels in order to produce power.\n\nCurrently the trend has been towards renewable fuels, such as [[Renewable energy#Biofuel|biofuels]] like alcohols.\n\n==Chemical==\nChemical fuels are substances that release energy by reacting with substances around them, most notably by the process of [[combustion]]. Most of the chemical energy released in combustion was not stored in the chemical bonds of the fuel, but in the weak double bond of molecular oxygen.<ref name=\"Schmidt-Rohr 15\">{{cite journal | last1 = Schmidt-Rohr | first1 = K | year = 2015 | title = Why Combustions Are Always Exothermic, Yielding About 418 kJ per Mole of O<sub>2</sub> | doi = 10.1021/acs.jchemed.5b00333 | journal = J.

First, by their physical properties, as a solid, liquid or gas. Secondly, on the basis of their occurrence: ''primary (natural fuel)'' and ''secondary (artificial fuel)''. Thus, a general classification of chemical fuels is:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:1em auto 1em auto;\"\n|+ General types of chemical fuels\n! scope=\"col\" |\n! scope=\"col\" | Primary (natural)\n! scope=\"col\" | Secondary (artificial)\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |[[Solid fuel]]s\n| [[wood]], [[coal]], [[peat]], [[Feces|dung]], etc. || [[coke (fuel)|coke]], [[charcoal]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |[[Liquid fuel]]s\n| [[petroleum]] || [[diesel fuel|diesel]], [[gasoline]], [[kerosene]], [[Liquefied petroleum gas|LPG]], [[coal tar]], [[naphtha]], [[ethanol]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |[[Gaseous fuel]]s\n| [[natural gas]] ||[[hydrogen]], [[propane]], [[methane]], [[coal gas]], [[water gas]], [[blast furnace]] gas, [[coke (fuel)|coke]] oven gas, [[CNG]]\n|}\n<!--either needs expansion or deletion<gallery>\nFile:Charcoal.jpg|[[Charcoal]]\nFile:Saterland peat digging by hand 1963.jpg|[[Peat]] digging by hand in [[Saterland]], 1963\n</gallery>-->\n\n===Solid fuel===\n{{main|Solid fuel}}\n\n[[File:Coal anthracite.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Coal is an important solid fuel]]\n\nSolid fuel refers to various types of [[solid]] material that are used as fuel to produce [[energy]] and provide [[heating]], usually released through [[combustion]]. Solid fuels include [[wood]] , [[charcoal]], [[peat]], [[coal]], [[hexamine fuel tablet]]s, and pellets made from wood (see [[wood pellets]]), [[maize|corn]], [[wheat]], [[rye]] and other [[cereal|grains]]. [[Solid-fuel rocket]] technology also uses solid fuel (see [[Rocket fuel#Solid propellants|solid propellants]]). Solid fuels have been used by humanity for many years to [[making fire|create fire]]. Coal was the fuel source which enabled the [[industrial revolution]], from firing [[furnace]]s, to running [[steam engine]]s. Wood was also extensively used to run [[steam locomotive]]s. Both peat and coal are still used in [[electricity generation]] today.\nThe use of some solid fuels (e.g. coal) is restricted or prohibited in some urban areas, due to unsafe levels of toxic emissions. The use of other solid fuels as wood is decreasing as heating technology and the availability of good quality fuel improves. In some areas, [[anthracite|smokeless coal]] is often the only solid fuel used. In Ireland, peat [[briquette]]s are used as smokeless fuel. They are also used to start a coal fire.\n\n===Liquid fuels===\n{{main|Liquid fuel}}\n\n[[File:Benzinepomp002.jpg|thumb|right|220px|A [[gasoline station]]]]\n\nLiquid fuels are combustible or energy-generating molecules that can be harnessed to create [[mechanical energy]], usually producing [[kinetic energy]]. They must also take the shape of their container; the fumes of liquid fuels are flammable, not the fluids.\n\nMost liquid fuels in widespread use are derived from the [[fossil fuels|fossilized remains]] of dead plants and animals by exposure to heat and pressure inside the Earth's crust. However, there are several types, such as [[hydrogen fuel]] (for [[automotive]] uses), [[ethanol]], [[jet fuel]] and [[bio-diesel]], which are all categorized as liquid fuels. [[Emulsified fuel]]s of oil in water, such as [[orimulsion]], have been developed as a way to make heavy oil fractions usable as liquid fuels. Many liquid fuels play a primary role in transportation and the economy.\n\nSome common properties of liquid fuels are that they are easy to transport and can be handled easily. They are also relatively easy to use for all engineering applications and in home use. Fuels like [[kerosene]] are rationed in some countries, for example in government-subsidized shops in India for home use.\n\nConventional [[diesel fuel|diesel]] is similar to [[gasoline]] in that it is a mixture of [[aliphatic hydrocarbon]]s extracted from [[petroleum]]. Kerosene is used in [[kerosene lamp]]s and as a fuel for cooking, heating, and small engines. [[Natural gas]], composed chiefly of [[methane]], can only exist as a liquid at very low temperatures (regardless of pressure), which limits its direct use as a liquid fuel in most applications. [[LP gas]] is a mixture of [[propane]] and [[butane]], both of which are easily compressible gases under standard atmospheric conditions. It offers many of the advantages of [[compressed natural gas]] (CNG) but is denser than air, does not burn as cleanly, and is much more easily compressed. Commonly used for cooking and space heating, LP gas and compressed propane are seeing increased use in motorized vehicles. Propane is the third most commonly used motor fuel globally.\n\n===Fuel gas===\n{{main|Fuel gas}}\n\n[[File:Propane tank 20lb.jpg|thumb|upright|right|A 20-pound ({{nowrap|9.1 kg}}) propane cylinder]]\n\nFuel gas is any one of a number of fuels that are [[gas]]eous under ordinary conditions. Many fuel gases are composed of [[hydrocarbons]] (such as [[methane]] or [[propane]]), [[hydrogen]], [[carbon monoxide]], or mixtures thereof. Such gases are sources of potential [[heat energy]] or [[light energy]] that can be readily transmitted and distributed through pipes from the point of origin directly to the place of consumption. Fuel gas is contrasted with [[liquid fuels]] and from [[solid fuel]]s, though some fuel gases are [[Liquefaction of gases|liquefied]] for storage or transport. While their gaseous nature can be advantageous, avoiding the difficulty of transporting solid fuel and the dangers of spillage inherent in liquid fuels, it can also be dangerous. It is possible for a fuel gas to be undetected and collect in certain areas, leading to the risk of a [[gas explosion]]. For this reason, [[odorizer]]s are added to most fuel gases so that they may be detected by a distinct smell. The most common type of fuel gas in current use is [[natural gas]].\n\n===Biofuels===\n{{main|Biofuel}}\n\n[[Biofuel]] can be broadly defined  as solid, liquid, or gas fuel consisting of, or derived from [[biomass]]. Biomass can also be used directly for heating or power\u2014known as ''biomass fuel''. Biofuel can be produced from any carbon source that can be replenished rapidly e.g. plants. Many different plants and plant-derived materials are used for biofuel manufacture.\n\nPerhaps the earliest fuel  employed by humans is wood. Evidence shows controlled fire was used up to 1.5 million years ago at [[Swartkrans]], South Africa. It is unknown which hominid species first used fire, as both ''[[Australopithecus]]'' and an early species of ''[[Homo (genus)|Homo]]'' were present at the sites.<ref>{{Cite news\n | last=Rincon | first=Paul | date=22 March 2004\n | title=Bones hint at first use of fire | publisher=[[BBC News]]\n | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/3557077.stm\n | accessdate=2007-09-11 }}</ref> As a fuel, wood has remained in use up until the present day, although it has been superseded for many purposes by other sources.

A global movement toward the generation of [[renewable energy]] is therefore under way to help meet increased energy needs. The burning of fossil fuels produces around 21.3 billion [[tonnes]] (21.3 [[gigatonne]]s) of [[carbon dioxide]] (CO<sub>2</sub>) per year, but it is estimated that natural processes can only absorb about half of that amount, so there is a net increase of 10.65 billion tonnes of atmospheric carbon dioxide per year (one tonne of atmospheric carbon is equivalent to 44/12 or 3.7 tonnes of carbon dioxide).<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.eia.doe.gov/oiaf/1605/ggccebro/chapter1.html|title=US Department of Energy on greenhouse gases|accessdate=2007-09-09}}</ref>  Carbon dioxide is one of the [[greenhouse gas]]es that enhances [[radiative forcing]] and contributes to [[global warming]], causing the [[Instrumental temperature record|average surface temperature]] of the Earth to rise in response, which [[Scientific opinion on climate change|the vast majority of climate scientists]] agree will cause major [[Effects of global warming|adverse effects]].\nFuels are a source of energy.\n\n===Energy===\nThe amount of energy from different types of fuel depends on the [[stoichiometric ratio]], the chemically correct air and fuel ratio to ensure complete combustion of fuel, and its [[specific energy]], the energy per unit mass.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|+ [[Energy capacity|Energy capacities]] of common types of fuel\n|-\n!

Technically speaking, all matter can be a nuclear fuel because any element under the right conditions will release nuclear energy,{{dubious|date=October 2016}} but the materials commonly referred to as nuclear fuels are those that will produce energy without being placed under extreme duress. Nuclear fuel is a material that can be 'burned' by [[nuclear fission]] or [[nuclear fusion|fusion]] to derive [[Nuclear power|nuclear energy]]. ''Nuclear fuel'' can refer to the fuel itself, or to physical objects (for example bundles composed of '''fuel rods''') composed of the fuel material, mixed with structural, [[neutron moderator|neutron moderating]], or neutron reflecting materials.\n\nMost nuclear fuels contain heavy [[fissile]] elements that are capable of nuclear fission.  When these fuels are struck by neutrons, they are in turn capable of emitting neutrons when they break apart.  This makes possible a self-sustaining [[chain reaction]] that releases energy with a controlled rate in a [[nuclear reactor]] or with a very rapid uncontrolled rate in a [[nuclear weapon]].\n\nThe most common fissile nuclear fuels are [[uranium-235]] (<sup>235</sup>U) and [[Pu-239|plutonium-239]] (<sup>239</sup>Pu). The actions of mining, refining, purifying, using, and ultimately disposing of nuclear fuel together make up the [[nuclear fuel cycle]]. Not all types of nuclear fuels create power from nuclear fission.  [[Plutonium-238]] and some other elements are used to produce small amounts of nuclear power by [[radioactive decay]] in [[radioisotope thermoelectric generator]]s and other types of [[atomic battery|atomic batteries]]. Also, light [[nuclide]]s such as [[tritium]] (<sup>3</sup>H) can be used as fuel for [[nuclear fusion]].\nNuclear fuel has the highest [[energy density]] of all practical fuel sources.\n\n===Fission===\n\n[[File:Nuclear fuel pellets.jpeg|thumb|[[Nuclear fuel]] pellets are used to release nuclear energy]]\n\nThe most common type of nuclear fuel used by humans is heavy [[fissile]] elements that can be made to undergo [[nuclear fission]] [[chain reaction]]s in a  [[nuclear reactor|nuclear fission reactor]]; ''nuclear fuel'' can refer to the material or to physical objects (for example fuel bundles composed of [[fuel rod]]s) composed of the fuel material, perhaps mixed with structural, [[neutron moderator|neutron moderating]], or neutron reflecting materials.  The most common fissile nuclear fuels are [[Uranium-235|<sup>235</sup>U]] and [[Pu-239|<sup>239</sup>Pu]], and the actions of mining, refining, purifying, using, and ultimately disposing of these elements together make up the [[nuclear fuel cycle]], which is important for its relevance to [[nuclear power]] generation and [[nuclear weapon]]s.\n\n===Fusion===\nFuels that produce energy by the process of [[nuclear fusion]] are currently not utilized by humans but are the main source of fuel for [[star]]s. Fusion fuels tend to be light elements such as [[hydrogen]] which will combine easily. Energy is required to start fusion by raising temperature so high all materials would turn into plasma, and allow nuclei to collide and stick together with each other before repelling due to electric charge. This process is called fusion and it can give out energy.\n\nIn stars that undergo nuclear fusion, fuel consists of [[atomic nuclei]] that can release energy by the absorption of a [[proton]] or [[neutron]]. In most stars the fuel is provided by hydrogen, which can combine to form [[helium]] through the [[proton-proton chain reaction]] or by the [[CNO cycle]]. When the hydrogen fuel is exhausted, nuclear fusion can continue with progressively heavier elements, although the net energy released is lower because of the smaller difference in nuclear binding energy. Once [[iron-56]] or [[isotopes of nickel|nickel-56]] nuclei are produced, no further energy can be obtained by nuclear fusion as these have the highest nuclear binding energies. The elements then on use up energy instead of giving off energy when fused. Therefore, fusion stops and the star dies. In attempts by humans, fusion is only carried out with hydrogen (isotope of 2 and 3) to form helium-4 as this reaction gives out the most net energy. Electric confinement ([[ITER]]), [[inertial confinement]](heating by laser) and heating by strong electric currents are the popular methods used. .<ref>{{Cite journal\n | last = Fewell | first = M.

This occurs naturally in liquids and solids. High energy density can also be provided by an [[internal combustion engine]]. These engines require clean-burning fuels. The fuels that are easiest to burn cleanly are typically liquids and gases. Thus, liquids meet the requirements of being both energy-dense and clean-burning. In addition, liquids (and gases) can be pumped, which means handling is easily mechanized, and thus less laborious.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Energy}}\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Alcohol fuel]]\n* [[Alternative fuels]]\n* [[Ammonia]]\n* [[Battery (electricity)]]\n* [[Bitumen-based fuel]]\n* [[Biofuels]]\n* [[Compressed natural gas]]\n* [[Cryogenic fuel]]\n* [[Emulsified fuel]]\n* [[Fuel card]]\n* [[Fuel cell]]\n* [[Fuel container]]\n* [[Fuel management systems]]\n* [[Fuel oil]]\n* [[Fuel poverty]]\n* [[Filling station]]\n* [[Hydrogen economy]]\n* [[Hydrogen fuel]]\n* [[Hypergolic fuel]]\n* [[Liquid fuels]]\n* [[List of energy topics]]\n* [[Marine fuel management]]\n* [[Propellant]]\n* [[Recycled fuel]]\n* [[Solid fuel]]\n* [[World energy resources and consumption]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n* {{Cite book| title = Chemistry 1 | author = Ratcliff, Brian| publisher = Cambridge University press | year= 2000 | isbn = 978-0-521-78778-9|display-authors=etal}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{Commons category|Fuels}}\n* {{cite web|url= http://ec.europa.eu/environment/co2/9994/en.pdf |title=Directive 1999/94/EC of the European Parliament and of the council of 13 December 1999, relating to the availability of consumer information on fuel economy and CO2 emissions in respect of the marketing of new passenger cars }}&nbsp;{{small|(140&nbsp;KB)}}.\n* [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31980L1268:EN:NOT Council Directive 80/1268/EEC Fuel consumption of motor vehicles].\n{{Motor fuel}}\n{{Firelighting}}\n{{Energy footer}}\n{{Fire}}\n{{Portal bar|Agriculture|Ecology|Energy|Clothing}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Fuels| ]]\n[[Category:Energy development]]\n", "name_user": "2601:8a:401:df00:4c05:9274:4375:2f31", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel"}

For instance, he noted how a ''[[New York Journal-American]]'' story led a story stating \"The government ended its cross-examination of Alger Hiss at 3:01 p.m. today after forcing him to admit he was an associate of Mrs. [[Carol Weiss King|Carol King]], prominent legal defender of Communists, and a friend of [[Nathan Witt]], ex-[[New Deal]] lawyer who was fired because of his Communist activities.\"  Hollenbeck noted that the transcript differed greatly, in that Hiss had said:  he had met King \"once or twice,\" while his description of when and where he met Witt even less clear.  He also noted the [[guilt by association]] tactics of fellow journalists, for example, [[Westbrook Pegler]], who sought to discredit [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] through link to Hiss via [[Felix Frankfurter]].<ref name=Ghiglione/>\n\n[[File:David A Morse.jpg|thumb|right|[[David A.

By the 14th century, the mountains behind the [[Gulf of Kotor]] were coming to be referred to as \"[[Montenegro]]\" ([[Montenegrin language|Montenegrin]]: ''Crna Gora''; literally translates as \u201cBlack Mountain\u201d), and by the 15th century, the name was coming to increasingly replace the older name, [[Zeta]]. \n<ref name=\"Fine94\">{{cite book|author1=John V. A. Fine|title=The Late Medieval Balkans: A Critical Survey from the Late Twelfth Century to the Ottoman Conquest|year=1994|publisher=University of Michigan Press|p=532}}</ref> Since the end of the 17th century, Montenegro existed as a de facto independent country, first as a theocratic [[Prince-Bishopric of Montenegro|Prince-Bishopric]] (1694\u20131852), then as a secular [[Principality of Montenegro|Principality]] (1852\u20131910) and finally as a [[Kingdom of Montenegro|Kingdom]] (1910\u20131918). After the end of [[World War I]], Montenegro was incorporated into the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]], thus losing its statehood. This led to a short-lived [[Christmas Uprising]] of 1919, between supporters of [[Petrovi\u0107-Njego\u0161 dynasty]] and Montenegrin statehood and proponents of unification with Serbia and Yugoslavia under the [[Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107 dynasty]]. After the World War II, Montenegro regained its political sovereignty, becoming one of the six constituent republics of the [[SFR Yugoslavia]], and Montenegro's sovereignty was recognised once again. A portion of Montenegrins declares as ethnic [[Serbs]], while a larger proportion of citizens of Montenegro identifies ethnically as Montenegrin, a division that was exacerbated with the fall of socialism. This division has deepened further since the movement for full Montenegrin independence from the [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] began to gain ground in 1991, while full independence was regained after the [[2006 Montenegrin independence referendum|2006 referendum]].\n\nIn the 2011 census, around 280,000 or ''44.98%'' of the population of Montenegro identified themselves as ethnic Montenegrins, while around 180,000 or ''28.73%'' identified themselves as Serbs. The number of \"Montenegrins\", \"Serbs\" and \"Bosniaks\" fluctuates from census to census, not due to real demographic changes, but due to changes in how people self-identify nationally. According to the [[Demographic history of Serbia|Serbian 2011 census]], there are 38,527 ethnic Montenegrins in [[Serbia]], accounting for ''0.54%'' of its population. In addition, a significant number of Serbs in Serbia and [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] are of Montenegrin ancestry, but exact numbers are difficult to assess \u2013 the inhabitants of Montenegro contributed greatly to the repopulation of a depopulated Serbia after two rebellions against the [[Ottoman Empire]] in the early 19th century{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}. On 19 October 2007, Montenegro adopted a new Constitution which proclaimed [[Montenegrin language|Montenegrin]] (a standardized variety of [[Serbo-Croatian language|Serbo-Croatian]]) as the official language of Montenegro.\n\nThe term \"Montenegrins\" in a wider sense can also be used to denote all residents of Montenegro, regardless of their national and religious affiliation.\n\n==History==\n{{See also|History of Montenegro}}\n\n===Middle Ages===\n\nSlavs settled in the Balkans during the 6th and 7th centuries. According to ''[[De Administrando Imperio]]'', there existed three Slavic polities on the territory of modern Montenegro: [[Duklja]], roughly corresponding to the southern half; [[Travunia]], the west; and [[Principality of Serbia (early medieval)|Principality of Serbia]], the north. Duklja emerged as an independent state during the 11th century, initially held by the [[Vojislavljevi\u0107 dynasty]], later to be incorporated into the state of the [[Nemanji\u0107 dynasty]].\n\nBy forming the first country under the rule of [[\u010caslav|\u010caslav Klonimirovi\u0107]], with the centre in the old town of Ras, all these areas belong to Serbian territory by conquest. By strengthening of the coastal [[Duklja]] and the noble family of [[Vojislavljevi\u0107 dynasty|Vojislavljevi\u0107]], in the beginning of the 11th century, they took power from [[Vlastimirovi\u0107 dynasty|Vlastimirovic]] dynasty, and soon after that, in 1077, Prince [[Mihailo Vojislavljevi\u0107]] got the crown from the Pope and proclaimed the [[Kingdom of Duklja]], with the centre in the city of [[Bar, Montenegro|Bar]].\n\nWith the descent of [[Vojislavljevi\u0107 dynasty]], nobleman [[Zavida|Zavid Vukanovi\u0107]], from Ribnica near Podgorica, a cousin of [[Vojislavljevi\u0107 dynasty|Vojislavljevi\u0107]] dynasty through a female line, gets four sons. His youngest son, [[Stefan Nemanja]], will later become the Grand Prince of the new Great [[Serbia]], and the founder of the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]] among all Serbs. He moves to the city of Ras, where he overthrows (and kills) his eldest brother, Tihomir, in 1169, and declares himself the Grand Prince of Ra\u0161ka. After his proclamation, the last Prince/King of Duklja, [[Mihailo Vojislavljevi\u0107]], dies, and [[Stefan Nemanja]] joins Duklja and [[Ra\u0161ka (region)|Ra\u0161ka]], and soon he returns the rest of the lands from the period of Prince [[\u010caslav|\u010caslav Klonimirovi\u0107]] and King [[Mihailo Vojislavljevi\u0107]]. From the reign of Stefan Nemanja to the fall of the Montenegrin medieval state, Duklja, by this time called Zeta, was a part of the united Great Serbia. Throughout the period of Nemanji\u0107 dynasty, [[Crnojevi\u0107 noble family|Crnojevi\u0107 dynasty]] became a noble family, and later on the line of Crnojevi\u0107 was replaced by the family of [[Bal\u0161i\u0107 noble family|Bal\u0161i\u0107i]], believed to be originating from France, who remain on the throne of the Zeta, by then known as Montenegro, until the fall of the Serbian state in 1459.\n\nThe region previously known as Duklja later became known as \"[[Zeta (crown land)|Zeta]]\". Between 1276 and 1309, Serbian queen [[Helen of Anjou]], the widow of the Serbian King [[Stefan Uro\u0161 I]], ruled Zeta, where she built and restored several monasteries, most notably the Monastery of Saints Sergius and Bacchus (Sr\u0111 and Vakh) on the Bojana river below [[Shkod\u00ebr|Skadar (Shkod\u00ebr)]]. The Venetian name ''Montenegro'', meaning \"black mountain\" occurred for the first time in the charter of St. Nicholas' monastery in Vranjina, dating to 1296, during Jelena's reign. Under King [[Stefan Uro\u0161 II Milutin of Serbia|Stefan Milutin]] (reigned 1282-1321), at the beginning of the 14th century, the Archdiocese in Bar was the biggest feudal domain in Zeta.\n\nIn the late 14th century, southern Montenegro ([[Lordship of Zeta|Zeta]]) came under the rule of the [[Bal\u0161i\u0107 noble family]], then the [[Crnojevi\u0107 noble family]], and by the 15th century, Zeta was more often referred to as ''Crna Gora'' ([[Venetian language|Venetian]]: ''{{lang|vec|monte negro}}''). In 1496, the Ottomans conquered Zeta and subsequently [[Sanjak of Montenegro|established a sanjak]] that was subordinated to the [[Sanjak of Scutari]]. Ottoman influence remained largely limited to urban areas, while various tribes in the highlands emerged as districts out of reach of the Ottomans. These tribes were at times united against the Ottomans, under the leadership of the [[Metropolitans of Montenegro]], the so-called \"prince-bishops\".\n\n===19th century===\n[[File:Proclamation of the Kingdom of Montenegro.jpg|thumb|Proclamation of the [[Kingdom of Montenegro]]]]\n[[File:Petar II Petrovic-Njegos.jpg|thumb|[[Petar II Petrovi\u0107-Njego\u0161]]]]\nWith the arrival of the Turks, because of the inaccessibility of the terrain, and because of the lack of interest of the Ottomans for the \"Montenegrin karst and fracture\"(inaccessible terrain), the tribes in Montenegro enjoyed more than autonomy, and less than independence, but even this did not prevent the Montenegrin tribes from raising various revolts against Turkish conquest . The people were divided into tribes, and shortly thereafter bloody accounts of \"brotherly\" tribes turned bloody. The most serious causes of these accidents were the lack of food in the then-Montenegro, and the few resources were left, were taken away by the Turks, and the conflicts were inevitable. At the beginning of the 18th century. From then on, to Prince [[Danilo I, Prince of Montenegro|Danilo Petrovic]], Montenegrins are under the theocratic rule of the [[Petrovi\u0107-Njego\u0161 dynasty|Petrovi\u0107 dynasty]]. Due to the impossibility of approach, due to the terrain of Montenegro, Bishop [[Petar I Petrovi\u0107-Njego\u0161|Petar I Petrovi\u0107 Njego\u0161]] cursed the tribes he was ruling, using their piety to inspire unity, and thus attempted to prevent the further slaughter of the fraternal people. After his death in 1830, [[Petar I Petrovi\u0107-Njego\u0161|Petar of Cetinje]] was buried in the monastery of the in [[Cetinje Monastery|Cetinje]] and was proclaimed a saint.\n[[File:Flag of Montenegro (1852\u20131905).svg|thumb|Flag of [[Principality of Montenegro]] ]]\nHis adopted son [[Petar II Petrovi\u0107-Njego\u0161|Petar II Petrovi\u0107 Njego\u0161]] ruled from 1830 until 1851. It is recorded as one of the greatest educators of the Serbian people in general. He wrote one of the most important works of the romantic epoch \"[[The Mountain Wreath|Mountain Wreath]]\" (regarded as one of the artistic foundations of Serbian nationalism), and he was also credited with bringing the final look of a Montenegrin hat, which is decorated with a black frame and represents the crown, more precisely, sorrow for the slavery of the Serbian people under Ottoman yoke. The top of the cap is red, symbolising blood, where 5 golden threads are engraved, thought to signify 5 centuries of slavery under the Turks. Within these golden threads there is a \"Cross\" with four Cyrillic letters (scores) S, a variant of the Byzantine Palaiologos tetragrammic cross, sometimes referred to as the variant of the [[Serbian cross]].\n[[File:Flag of Montenegro (1905\u20131918).svg|thumb|Flag of the [[Kingdom of Montenegro]] ]]\nHe ruled as a Bishop, but he also stood firm to see that Montenegro must be modernised. He built schools, roads, raised the Church, expanded the capital of [[Cetinje]]. After his death and funeral, he was succeeded by his nephew Prince [[Danilo I, Prince of Montenegro|Danilo Petrovi\u0107]] who ruled as the first secular ruler, with the title of Knjaz. Since then, Knja\u017eevina (Principality) of Montenegro was no longer a Prince-Bishopric, but a secular monarchy. This led to the opinion of the Turkish court that this change can lead to a major change in Montenegro, and a desire for \"independence\". In 1852, [[Omar Pasha|Omer-pasha]] sent a large army against the Montenegrins. A small Montenegrin army led by Prince Danilo's brother, Duke (Vojvoda) [[Mirko Petrovi\u0107-Njego\u0161|Mirko]], defended 30 remaining fighters in the monastery of the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]], [[Ostrog Monastery|Ostrog]] for 9 days. This is taken as the greatest heroic force of the people in those areas. One year later, Omer-pasha again tried to conquer Montenegro, but with the great heroism of Vojvoda Mirko, the Montenegrins performed the greatest victory over the Ottomans in the new century, after which Montenegro gained essential autonomy, the highest degree to independence, and a few decades later, full independence. [[Danilo I, Prince of Montenegro|Prince Danilo]] dies in 1860, and Danilo's adoptive son came to the throne, biological son of Vojvoda [[Mirko Petrovi\u0107-Njego\u0161|Mirko]], [[Nicholas I of Montenegro|Nikola Petrovi\u0107]]. He remained remembered in Montenegro as the greatest ruler, owing in large part to the fact that he was the first modern-day King of Montenegro and that it was under him that Montenegro's independence had been recognised. He is of great importance for the Montenegrin people in general, because he has fought against the Ottomans in the territory of Montenegro, Herzegovina, and Bosnia, and the people often called him \"Emperor of the Heroes\". Immediately after coming to power, a [[Herzegovina uprising (1852\u201362)|war]] for the liberation of the Montenegrin people in [[Herzegovina]] started in 1862, in which [[Principality of Montenegro]] entered, but later it turned out that she entered extremely unprepared and soon after that peace was made. After returning from Russia, the then emperor [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]] enlightened him, and immediately upon his arrival he began to work hard for the urbanisation of the country. He revised the army completely, built many courts and schools, and Montenegro began to look like a European state. In 1876, with the [[Principality of Serbia]] and the [[Obrenovi\u0107 dynasty]], he started a war, in history known as \"[[Herzegovina uprising (1875\u20131877)|War for the Liberation of the Serbian People]]\".\n\nA couple of years before the war, Prince [[Nicholas I of Montenegro|Nikola Petrovi\u0107]] with the Serbian prince [[Mihailo Obrenovi\u0107]] made an alliance in Venice, where beside the military alliance, a contract was signed on the dynastic heritage of the new future unified joint state. It was said that the plan is for Serbia to go back to its historical borders ([[De Administrando Imperio|On the management of the Empire]]) from the [[Timok]] River to the [[Una (Sava)|Una]] peak. The Montenegrin federal unit would be an integral part of the new common state, and in it [[Petrovi\u0107-Njego\u0161 dynasty|Petrovi\u0107 dynasty]] would have the title of the princes, while the [[Obrenovi\u0107 dynasty]] would wear a royal crown. The Montenegrins performed great victories, and by the end of the war at the [[Congress of Berlin|Berlin Congress]] in 1878, the Principality of Montenegro received recognized independence, and became an internationally recognized state. This act raised the then two Serbian states to the ranks of independence, and it meant encouragement for all Serbs to completely resist the Turkish occupation in all Serbian countries. After the war, [[Nicholas I of Montenegro|Prince Nikola]] wrote all his famous works, and the most famous work is the folk anthem \"[[Onamo, 'namo!|Onamo' namo!]] \", According to many, the most beautiful Serbian song about Kosovo. In 1910, then Prince Nikola, with the permission of the great powers of the [[Kingdom of Serbia]] and [[Peter I of Serbia|King Peter]], proclaimed another Serbian kingdom in the Balkans: the [[Kingdom of Montenegro]]. The flag of the new state has become a flagrant national flag (a Serbian tricolor with the coat of arms of [[Petrovi\u0107-Njego\u0161 dynasty|Petrovi\u0107-Njegos dynasty]]), while with the old flag, it is equally used in the people and the popular \"crusader\" flag of Montenegrins. Knjazevina (Principality) of Montenegro, with the address of Russia, announces the war on Japan. Naturally, the participation of Montenegrins in this war was more symbolic, as the gratitude of Montenegro to Russia for generous help. In the [[Balkan Wars]], the [[Kingdom of Montenegro]] and the [[Kingdom of Serbia]] participated in the liberation battles in the [[old Serbia]] ([[Kosovo Vilayet|Kosovo]], [[Metohija]], and [[Sanjak of Novi Pazar|Ra\u0161ka]]) and [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]]. Thus, a common border was established between the two new-age \"Serb\" states, and the dream of [[Nicholas I of Montenegro|King Nikola]] about the liberation of the \"Serbian cradle\" (Kosovo) was realised. At the beginning of the [[World War I|First World War]], Montenegro immediately declared war on [[Austria-Hungary]], after [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]], but in 1916 it had to capitulate after all forces held a rally on the direction of Serbian withdrawal through Albania. After the passage of the Serbian government and the king, the crushed Montenegrin army sacrificed itself for the future of the Serbian state. [[Nicholas I of Montenegro|King Nikola]], already ill and in his late years, left his homeland. He went to [[France]], where he died.\n\nThe Montenegrins maintained their ''de-facto'' independence from the Ottoman Empire during the Ottoman's reign over most of the Balkan region (Bosnia, Serbia, Bulgaria, etc.). The Montenegrins were gathered around the Metropolitans of the Cetinje Metropolitanate, which led to further national awakening of the Montenegrins all around. The creation of a theocratic state and its advancement into a secular and independent country was even more evident in the late 15th and early 16th centuries.\n\nThe rule of the [[House of Petrovi\u0107]] in the 18th and 19th century unified the Montenegrins and established strong ties with Russia and later with Serbia (under Ottoman occupation), with occasional help from the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]]. That period was marked by numerous battles with Ottoman conquerors as well as by a firmer establishment of a self-governed principality.\n\nIn 1878, the [[Congress of Berlin]] recognised Montenegro as the 26th independent state in the world. Montenegro participated in the [[Balkan Wars]] of 1912\u20131913, as well as in [[World War I]] on the side of the Allies.\n\n===Yugoslav era===\nAfter the liberation of the Serbian and other Yugoslav (South Slavic) peoples, the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] was proclaimed, but the \"Venetian Agreement\" between the then [[Nicholas I of Montenegro|Prince Nikola]] and [[Mihailo Obrenovi\u0107|Prince Mihailo Obrenovi\u0107]] was breached. With the unification with the [[Kingdom of Serbia]], Montenegro was to have autonomy under the prince's dynasty [[Petrovi\u0107-Njego\u0161 dynasty|Petrovi\u0107-Njego\u0161]]. Due to this act, the Montenegrin public was divided on two sides. The first, majority party, better known as [[Whites (Montenegro)|Bjela\u0161i]] (\"The Whites\"), advocated unconditional unification with the Serbian Kingdom under the [[Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107 dynasty|Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107]] dynasty, while [[Greens (Montenegro)|Zelena\u0161i]] (\"The Greens\"), in a minority, advocated a conditional union that would respect the Venice Treaty. In Podgorica on October 26, 1918, the [[Podgorica Assembly]] unanimously voted that Montenegro unconditionally unites with Serbia into Yugoslavia, without any autonomy. Due to this decision, the few Greens are persecuted, and their rebellion is suppressed in the coming years. In 1929, with the proclamation of the Zeta Banovina with its headquarters in Podgorica, the territory of the former Montenegro with eastern Herzegovina and Metohija gained autonomy in the form of banovina (province), and the ruler of the region became a ban, whom the king personally appoints. [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia|King Aleksandar Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107]] ordered the construction of a chapel in [[Lov\u0107en]] in 1925, and the remains of, as many would say, \"the wisest Serb\" Prince-Bishop [[Petar II Petrovi\u0107-Njego\u0161|Petar II Petrovi\u0107 Njego\u0161]] were transferred there in a grandiose ceremony. At the beginning of the Second World War, the army in the [[Zeta Banovina]] area made great success against the Italian occupation of the army, expelling the Italian army to [[Shkod\u00ebr|Shkodra]] in [[Albania]]. After the breakup of the Yugoslav state, Montenegro gets a puppet government led by [[Sekula Drljevi\u0107]], who will be expelled from the country later.\n\nMontenegro unconditionally joined Serbia on November 26, 1918 in a controversial decision of the [[Podgorica Assembly]], and soon afterwards became a part of the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes]], later renamed [[Yugoslavia]]. A number of Montenegrin chieftains, disappointed by the effective disappearance of Montenegro, which they perceived to have resulted from political manipulation, rose up in arms during January 1919 in an uprising known as the [[Christmas Uprising|Christmas Rebellion]], which was crushed in a severe, comprehensive military campaign by 1922\u201323. Annexation of the [[Kingdom of Montenegro]] on November 13, 1918 gained international recognition only at the Conference of Ambassadors in [[Paris]], held on July 13, 1922.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.orderofdanilo.org/en/family/index.htm|title=Interesting things about the royal order of Montenegro - Untitled|website=Orderofdanilo.org|accessdate=2017-08-19|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090516203805/http://www.orderofdanilo.org/en/family/index.htm|archivedate=2009-05-16}}</ref> In 1929 the newly renamed [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] was reorganised into provinces (''banovine'') one of which, [[Zeta Banovina]], encompassed the old Kingdom of Montenegro and had [[Cetinje]] as its administrative centre.\n\nBetween the two world wars, the [[Communist Party of Yugoslavia]] opposed the Yugoslav monarchy and its unification policy, and supported Montenegrin autonomy, gaining considerable support in Montenegro. During [[World War II]], many Montenegrins joined the [[Yugoslav partisans|Yugoslav partisan]] forces, although the portion joining the [[chetniks]] was also significant. One third of all officers in the partisan army were Montenegrins. They also gave a disproportionate number of highest-ranked party officials and generals. During WWII [[Italy]] occupied Montenegro (in 1941) and annexed to the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861\u20131946)|Kingdom of Italy]] the area of Kotor, where there was a small Roman community (descendants from the populations of the renaissance-era [[Albania Veneta]]).\n\nWhen the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|second Yugoslavia]] was formed in 1945, the Communists who led the Partisans during the war formed the new r\u00e9gime. They recognised, sanctioned, and fostered a national identity of Montenegrins as a people distinct from the Serbs and other South Slavs. The number of people who were registered as Montenegrins in Montenegro was 90% in 1948; it had been dropping since, to 62% in 1991. With the rise of Serbian nationalism in the late 80's the number of citizens who declared themselves Montenegrin dropped sharply from 61.7%, in the 1991 census, to 43.16% in 2003. For a detailed overview of these trends, see the [[Demographic history of Montenegro]].\n\nAfter the end of the [[World War II|Second World War]], the official position of the Montenegrin assembly is: ''The Montenegrin nation is the purest ethnic group among the Serbs''.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=\u0421\u0442\u043e\u0458\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u045b|first=\u0417\u0434\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0430|date=2013-01-01|journal=Godi\u0161njak Pravnog Fakulteta U Banja Luci|volume=1|issue=35|pages=111|doi=10.7251/gpf1335111s|issn=2233-0429|title=\u041e \u041f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043d\u043e\u043c \u0421\u0442\u0430\u0442\u0443\u0441\u0443 \u0418 \u041e\u0432\u043b\u0430\u0448\u045b\u0435\u045a\u0438\u043c\u0430 \u041d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043d\u0435 \u0421\u043a\u0443\u043f\u0448\u0442\u0438\u043d\u0435 \u0423 \u0421\u0440\u0431\u0438\u0458\u0438 1858 \u2013 1888|doi-access=free}}</ref> The Yugoslav state recognised Montenegrins as a separate nation, different from Serbs and other Slavs, and gave them their own statistical code at the 1948 population census, where about 90% of Montenegrin citizens declared themselves Montenegrin.\n\nDuring communism in the new SFRY, the flag of the SR of Montenegro was identical with the flag of the SR of Serbia, where it was a Serbian tricolour with a five-pointed star in the middle, while the Coat of Arms was a tower by the sea, surrounded by a wreath, wrapped with a Serbian tricolour. By introducing standards for the new Montenegrin nation, the people of Montenegro were confused, but it was explained that the Montenegrin nation was \"the purest among the Serbs\", and the entire people of Montenegro (predominantly the Orthodox part) expressed themselves as Montenegrin, not imagining it would later mean a separation from the Serb ethnic identity. The Serb identity in Montenegro is usually perceived as separate from the Serbian identity, considering the Serbs as a larger ethnic group separated into Serbians, Montenegrins, and others depending on the polity they come from.\n\nInitially, after the fall of Communism in the early 1990s, the idea of a distinct Montenegrin ethnic identity had been taken over by independence-minded Montenegrins. The ruling [[Democratic Party of Socialists of Montenegro|Democratic Party of Socialists]] (DPS) (rebranded Communist Party), led by Prime Minister [[Milo \u0110ukanovi\u0107]] and President [[Momir Bulatovi\u0107]], was firmly allied with [[Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107]] throughout this period and opposed such movements.\n\nDuring the [[Bosnian War]] and [[Croatian War]] (1991\u20131995) Montenegro participated with its [[police]] and paramilitary forces in the attacks on [[Dubrovnik]] and Bosnian towns along with Serbian troops. It conducted persecutions against Bosniak refugees who were arrested by the Montenegrin police and transported to Serb camps in Fo\u010da, where they were executed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bosnjaci.net/aktuelno.php?id=4311|title=PORODICA NED\u017dIBA LOJE O NJEGOVOM HAP\u0160ENJU I DEPORTACIJI 1992.

Part of the army from the then SR of Montenegro is attacking Herzegovina and [[Dubrovnik]], and keeps Dubrovnik under [[Siege of Dubrovnik|siege]] for almost eight months. In this period, the Montenegrins have an old sense of national affiliation, and at a referendum almost 100% of the respondents who voted on the referendum declare that they want to stay in the new state the neighbourhood of Serbia and Montenegro, the [[Serbia and Montenegro|Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]]. During the siege of Dubrovnik, the Serbian (Montenegrin) paramilitary formation invents the saying: \"From [[Lov\u0107en]] a fairy salutes, where are you Serbian Dubrovnik!\" (''Serbian: \"\u0421\u0430 \u041b\u043e\u0432\u045b\u0435\u043d\u0430 \u0432\u0438\u043b\u0430 \u043a\u043b\u0438\u0447\u0435, \u0452\u0435 \u0441\u0438 \u0441\u0440\u043f\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0414\u0443\u0431\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043d\u0438\u0447\u0435!\"''), which has been taken many times as a verse with a negative connotation, because of the city being besieged for so much time. After the abolition of communism and the creation of a new state, the [[Republic of Montenegro (1992\u20132006)|federal unit of the Republic of Montenegro]] receives a new flag and the coat-of-arms, where the flag was a classic Montenegrin national flag (a Serbian tricolour with blue colour), while the coat of arms of the Coat of Arms is taken from the historical emblem of [[Petrovi\u0107-Njego\u0161 dynasty|Petrovi\u0107]]. Then, the great fighters for the joint [[Serbia and Montenegro|FRY]], [[Momir Bulatovi\u0107]] and [[Milo \u0110ukanovi\u0107]], together with [[Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107]], rule the state union. The paths of [[Milo \u0110ukanovi\u0107]] and [[Momir Bulatovi\u0107]] diverge before the start of the NATO aggression against the [[Serbia and Montenegro|FRY]], and [[Milo \u0110ukanovi\u0107]] begins to change attitudes drastically, starting first with the political attitudes and afterwards the national and religious. In 1997 a full-blown rift occurred within DPS, and \u0110ukanovi\u0107's faction won over Bulatovi\u0107's, who formed a new [[Socialist People's Party of Montenegro]] (SNP). The DPS distanced itself from Milo\u0161evi\u0107 and gradually took over the independence idea from the [[Liberal Alliance of Montenegro]] and the [[Social Democratic Party of Montenegro|SDP]], and has won all elections since. In the fall of 1999, shortly after the [[NATO]] bombing of Yugoslavia, the \u0110ukanovi\u0107-led Montenegrin leadership came out with a platform for the re-definition of relations within the federation that called for more Montenegrin involvement in the areas of defence and foreign policy, though the platform fell short of pushing for independence. After Milo\u0161evi\u0107's overthrow on October 5, 2000, \u0110ukanovi\u0107 for the first time came out in support of full independence. Montenegro started increasingly moving away from Serbia, and in 2003, the Parliament of Montenegro sought amendments to the Constitution. With these amendments, and the [[Republic of Montenegro (1992\u20132006)|Federal Unit of Montenegro]] was allowed to call a referendum on independence, which took place on 21 May 2006.\n\nWhen the referendum was announced, independence was obtained by a narrow majority. However, the bar was set high in order to avoid any dispute after the vote, with the requirement for a 55% of votes in favour of independence. Since the proclamation of independence, the policy of making a new ethnic identity is even more intensified by official Montenegro, often used for political purposes, whereas the citizens still remain divided on the issue of ethnic identity.\n\n==Language==\n{{Main|Montenegrin language|Serbo-Croatian language}}\nMontenegrins speak [[Montenegrin language|Montenegrin]], an [[Ijekavian]] variant of the [[Shtokavian dialect]] of the [[pluricentric]] [[Serbo-Croatian]] language. Neo-shtokavian Eastern-Herzegovinian sub-dialect is spoken in the North-West (largest city Nik\u0161i\u0107), and old shtokavian Zeta sub-dialect is spoken in the rest of Montenegro, including capital Podgorica and the Old Royal Capital of Cetinje, and eastern [[Sanjak]].\n\nThe Zeta dialect features additional sounds: a [[voiceless alveolo-palatal fricative]] ({{IPA|/\u0255/}}), [[voiced alveolo-palatal fricative]] *({{IPA|/\u0291/}}, (occurring in other jekavian dialects as well) and a [[voiced alveolar affricate]] ({{IPA|dz}}, shared with other old-\u0161tokavian dialects). Both sub-dialects are characterised by highly specific accents (shared with other old-\u0161tokavian dialects) and several \"hyper-ijekavisms\" (i.e. ''nijesam'', where the rest of shtokavian area uses ''nisam'') and \"hyper-[[iotation]]s\" (''\u0111evojka'' for ''djevojka'', ''\u0111eca'' for ''djeca'' etc.) (these features, especially the hyper-iotation, are more prominent in the Zeta sub-dialect), that are common in all Montenegrin vernaculars.\n\nOn the [[sociolinguistic]] level, the language has been classified as a dialect of [[Serbo-Croatian language|Serbo-Croat]]. The Montenegrin constitution currently defines Montenegrin as the official language. Since the campaign for independence, a movement for recognition of the [[Montenegrin language]] as wholly separate from Serbian and other standard variants of Serbo-Croat (Bosnian, Croatian) has emerged, finding the basis for separate language identity mostly in the above-mentioned dialectal specifics. In the 2011 census, 42.88% of Montenegrin citizens stated that they speak the Serbian language, while 36.97% stated that they speak Montenegrin. Most of the young people under 18 in Montenegro, 39.23 percent, say they speak Montenegrin, while 37.47% call their mother tongue Serbian, as shown in the census held from 1 to 15 April 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vijesti.me/vijesti/drustvo/vecina-mladih-do-18-godina-govori-crnogorskim-jezikom|title=Ve\u0107ina mladih do 18 godina govori crnogorskim jezikom|website=Vijesti.me|date=July 26, 2011|accessdate=29 July 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Religion==\n{{further|Religion in Montenegro}}\nMost Montenegrins are [[Serbian Orthodox Church|Serbian Orthodox]], predominantly belonging to the [[Metropolitanate of Montenegro and the Littoral]] of the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]] as well as its four other eparchies (dioceses) that are active in parts of Montenegro and neighbouring countries, namely the [[Eparchy of Budimlja and Nik\u0161i\u0107]], the [[Eparchy of Mile\u0161eva]], and the [[Eparchy of Zahumlje and Herzegovina]]. A very small minority are adherents of the non-canonical and unrecognised [[Montenegrin Orthodox Church]].\n\nAccording to the census of 2011, people that declared Montenegrin as their ethnicity declared the following religious identity: \n*[[Eastern Orthodox]]: 248,523 (88.7%)\n*[[Islam in Montenegro|Islam]]: 12,931 (4.6%)\n*[[Catholic Church in Montenegro|Catholic]]: 5,667 (2.0%)\n*[[Protestantism in Montenegro|Protestantism]]: 921 (0.3%)\n*[[Atheism]]/[[Agnosticism]]: 6,393 (2.3%)\n*Others: 5,883 (2.1%)\n\n==Culture==\n{{Main|Culture of Montenegro}}\n[[File:Montenegrin Herzegovinian costume.jpg|Male folk costume from Montenegro|thumb]]\nThe most important dimension of Montenegrins' culture is the [[ethic]]al ideal of ''\u010cojstvo i juna\u0161tvo'', roughly translated as \"Chivalry and Bravery\". Another result of its centuries-long [[warrior]] history, is the unwritten code of [[Chivalry]] that [[Marko Miljanov]], one of the most famous warriors in his time, tried to describe in his book ''Primjeri \u010dojstva i juna\u0161tva'' (Examples of Humanity and Bravery) at the end of 19th century. Its main principles stipulate that to deserve a true respect of its people, a warrior has to show virtues of [[integrity]], [[dignity]], [[humility]], [[self-sacrifice]] for the just cause if necessary, [[respect]] for others, and [[wiktionary:Rectitude|Rectitude]], along with the [[bravery]]. In the old days of battle, it resulted in Montenegrins fighting to the death, since being captured was considered the greatest [[shame]]. Miljanov defined the two characteristics in a maxim roughly translated as: \"Bravery is when I defend myself from the other, chivalry is when I defend the other from myself\" (''\"Juna\u0161tvo je kada sebe branim od drugoga, \u010dojstvo je kada drugoga branim od sebe\"'').\n\nThis ethos is still an important part of most Montenegrins' ethical belief system, and understanding it is essential in order to understand Montenegrin identity and self-perception. Most of extraordinary examples of Montenegrin conduct during its long history can be traced to the code.\n\nMontenegrins' long-standing history of fighting for independence is invariably linked with strong traditions of folk [[epic poetry]]. A prominent feature of Montenegrin culture is the [[gusle]], a one-stringed instrument played by a story-teller who sings or recites stories of heroes and battles in [[decasyllable|decasyllabic verse]]. These traditions are stronger in the northern parts of the country and are also shared with people in eastern [[Herzegovina]], western [[Serbia]], northern [[Albania]], and central [[Dalmatia]].\n\nOn the substratum of folk epic poetry, poets like [[Petar II Petrovi\u0107 Njego\u0161]], widely considered the most one of the most brilliant Montenegrins and Southern Slavs in history, have created their own expression. Njego\u0161's epic book ''Gorski Vijenac'' (''[[The Mountain Wreath]]'') presents the central point of Montenegrin culture as struggle for freedom.\n\nOn the other hand, Adriatic cities like [[Herceg-Novi]], [[Kotor]], and [[Budva]] had strong trading and maritime traditions, and were more open for [[Venetian Republic|Venetian]], [[Republic of Ragusa|Ragusan]], and other [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] influences. Possession of those cities often changed, but their population was basically a mixture of people with Orthodox and Catholic religions and traditions. These cities were incorporated into Montenegro only after the fall of Austria-Hungary. In those cities, stronger influences of medieval and renaissance [[architecture]], [[painting]], and [[lyric poetry]] can be found, and while the adherence to the principles of chivalry and bravery are part of their ethos they are usually less central than in the areas of \"old Montenegro\".\n\n==Anthropology==\nVlahovi\u0107 (2008) noted many [[Biological anthropology|anthropological studies]] which showed that Montenegrin people have strong [[Dinaric race|Dinaric]] type (with seaboard, central, Durmitor, mountain and other subtypes) autochthonous on the [[Dinaric Alps]] since the Mesolithic period. Dinaric peoples, including Montenegrins, are among the tallest people in the world. The type, particularly in Montenegro, is distinguished by brachiochepal shape, broad forehead, wide relief and strong face, wide jaw and noticeably flat notched head, while arms and legs are proportional to the body height. Hair is commonly of black color, with black or blue eyes.<ref name=\"VlahovicAnthro\">{{cite journal |last=Vlahovi\u0107 |first=Petar |title=Dinarski tip i njegovi varijeteti u Crnoj Gori |trans-title=Dinara type and its varieties in Montenegro |year=2008 |journal=Journal of the Anthropologycal Society of Serbia |volume=43 |pages=7\u201314 |issn=1820-7936}}</ref>\n\nAnthropologist [[Bo\u017eina Ivanovi\u0107]] considered that the development of the Montenegrin Dinaric variety was influenced by gracilisation and brachycephalisation; they have characteristics which were not found in other Slavic and non-Slavic European populations, nor morphological properties from paleo-anthropological series originating from the Slavic [[necropolis]] from other South Slavic area.

A. Fine|title=The Late Medieval Balkans: A Critical Survey from the Late Twelfth Century to the Ottoman Conquest|year=1994|publisher=University of Michigan Press|p=532}}</ref> Since the end of the 17th century, Montenegro existed as a de facto independent country, first as a theocratic [[Prince-Bishopric of Montenegro|Prince-Bishopric]] (1694\u20131852), then as a secular [[Principality of Montenegro|Principality]] (1852\u20131910) and finally as a [[Kingdom of Montenegro|Kingdom]] (1910\u20131918). After the end of [[World War I]], Montenegro was incorporated into the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]], thus losing its statehood. This led to a short-lived [[Christmas Uprising]] of 1919, between supporters of [[Petrovi\u0107-Njego\u0161 dynasty]] and Montenegrin statehood and proponents of unification with Serbia and Yugoslavia under the [[Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107 dynasty]]. After the World War II, Montenegro regained its political sovereignty, becoming one of the six constituent republics of the [[SFR Yugoslavia]], and Montenegro's sovereignty was recognised once again. A portion of Montenegrins declares as ethnic [[Serbs]], while a larger proportion of citizens of Montenegro identifies ethnically as Montenegrin, a division that was exacerbated with the fall of socialism. This division has deepened further since the movement for full Montenegrin independence from the [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] began to gain ground in 1991, while full independence was regained after the [[2006 Montenegrin independence referendum|2006 referendum]].\n\nIn the 2011 census, around 280,000 or ''44.98%'' of the population of Montenegro identified themselves as ethnic Montenegrins, while around 180,000 or ''28.73%'' identified themselves as Serbs. The number of \"Montenegrins\", \"Serbs\" and \"Bosniaks\" fluctuates from census to census, not due to real demographic changes, but due to changes in how people self-identify nationally. According to the [[Demographic history of Serbia|Serbian 2011 census]], there are 38,527 ethnic Montenegrins in [[Serbia]], accounting for ''0.54%'' of its population. In addition, a significant number of Serbs in Serbia and [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] are of Montenegrin ancestry, but exact numbers are difficult to assess \u2013 the inhabitants of Montenegro contributed greatly to the repopulation of a depopulated Serbia after two rebellions against the [[Ottoman Empire]] in the early 19th century{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}. On 19 October 2007, Montenegro adopted a new Constitution which proclaimed [[Montenegrin language|Montenegrin]] (a standardized variety of [[Serbo-Croatian language|Serbo-Croatian]]) as the official language of Montenegro.\n\nThe term \"Montenegrins\" in a wider sense can also be used to denote all residents of Montenegro, regardless of their national and religious affiliation.\n\n==History==\n{{See also|History of Montenegro}}\n\n===Middle Ages===\n\nSlavs settled in the Balkans during the 6th and 7th centuries. According to ''[[De Administrando Imperio]]'', there existed three Slavic polities on the territory of modern Montenegro: [[Duklja]], roughly corresponding to the southern half; [[Travunia]], the west; and [[Principality of Serbia (early medieval)|Principality of Serbia]], the north. Duklja emerged as an independent state during the 11th century, initially held by the [[Vojislavljevi\u0107 dynasty]], later to be incorporated into the state of the [[Nemanji\u0107 dynasty]].\n\nBy forming the first country under the rule of [[\u010caslav|\u010caslav Klonimirovi\u0107]], with the centre in the old town of Ras, all these areas belong to Serbian territory by conquest. By strengthening of the coastal [[Duklja]] and the noble family of [[Vojislavljevi\u0107 dynasty|Vojislavljevi\u0107]], in the beginning of the 11th century, they took power from [[Vlastimirovi\u0107 dynasty|Vlastimirovic]] dynasty, and soon after that, in 1077, Prince [[Mihailo Vojislavljevi\u0107]] got the crown from the Pope and proclaimed the [[Kingdom of Duklja]], with the centre in the city of [[Bar, Montenegro|Bar]].\n\nWith the descent of [[Vojislavljevi\u0107 dynasty]], nobleman [[Zavida|Zavid Vukanovi\u0107]], from Ribnica near Podgorica, a cousin of [[Vojislavljevi\u0107 dynasty|Vojislavljevi\u0107]] dynasty through a female line, gets four sons. His youngest son, [[Stefan Nemanja]], will later become the Grand Prince of the new Great [[Serbia]], and the founder of the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]] among all Serbs. He moves to the city of Ras, where he overthrows (and kills) his eldest brother, Tihomir, in 1169, and declares himself the Grand Prince of Ra\u0161ka. After his proclamation, the last Prince/King of Duklja, [[Mihailo Vojislavljevi\u0107]], dies, and [[Stefan Nemanja]] joins Duklja and [[Ra\u0161ka (region)|Ra\u0161ka]], and soon he returns the rest of the lands from the period of Prince [[\u010caslav|\u010caslav Klonimirovi\u0107]] and King [[Mihailo Vojislavljevi\u0107]]. From the reign of Stefan Nemanja to the fall of the Montenegrin medieval state, Duklja, by this time called Zeta, was a part of the united Great Serbia. Throughout the period of Nemanji\u0107 dynasty, [[Crnojevi\u0107 noble family|Crnojevi\u0107 dynasty]] became a noble family, and later on the line of Crnojevi\u0107 was replaced by the family of [[Bal\u0161i\u0107 noble family|Bal\u0161i\u0107i]], believed to be originating from France, who remain on the throne of the Zeta, by then known as Montenegro, until the fall of the Serbian state in 1459.\n\nThe region previously known as Duklja later became known as \"[[Zeta (crown land)|Zeta]]\". Between 1276 and 1309, Serbian queen [[Helen of Anjou]], the widow of the Serbian King [[Stefan Uro\u0161 I]], ruled Zeta, where she built and restored several monasteries, most notably the Monastery of Saints Sergius and Bacchus (Sr\u0111 and Vakh) on the Bojana river below [[Shkod\u00ebr|Skadar (Shkod\u00ebr)]]. The Venetian name ''Montenegro'', meaning \"black mountain\" occurred for the first time in the charter of St. Nicholas' monastery in Vranjina, dating to 1296, during Jelena's reign. Under King [[Stefan Uro\u0161 II Milutin of Serbia|Stefan Milutin]] (reigned 1282-1321), at the beginning of the 14th century, the Archdiocese in Bar was the biggest feudal domain in Zeta.\n\nIn the late 14th century, southern Montenegro ([[Lordship of Zeta|Zeta]]) came under the rule of the [[Bal\u0161i\u0107 noble family]], then the [[Crnojevi\u0107 noble family]], and by the 15th century, Zeta was more often referred to as ''Crna Gora'' ([[Venetian language|Venetian]]: ''{{lang|vec|monte negro}}''). In 1496, the Ottomans conquered Zeta and subsequently [[Sanjak of Montenegro|established a sanjak]] that was subordinated to the [[Sanjak of Scutari]]. Ottoman influence remained largely limited to urban areas, while various tribes in the highlands emerged as districts out of reach of the Ottomans. These tribes were at times united against the Ottomans, under the leadership of the [[Metropolitans of Montenegro]], the so-called \"prince-bishops\".\n\n===19th century===\n[[File:Proclamation of the Kingdom of Montenegro.jpg|thumb|Proclamation of the [[Kingdom of Montenegro]]]]\n[[File:Petar II Petrovic-Njegos.jpg|thumb|[[Petar II Petrovi\u0107-Njego\u0161]]]]\nWith the arrival of the Turks, because of the inaccessibility of the terrain, and because of the lack of interest of the Ottomans for the \"Montenegrin karst and fracture\"(inaccessible terrain), the tribes in Montenegro enjoyed more than autonomy, and less than independence, but even this did not prevent the Montenegrin tribes from raising various revolts against Turkish conquest . The people were divided into tribes, and shortly thereafter bloody accounts of \"brotherly\" tribes turned bloody. The most serious causes of these accidents were the lack of food in the then-Montenegro, and the few resources were left, were taken away by the Turks, and the conflicts were inevitable. At the beginning of the 18th century. From then on, to Prince [[Danilo I, Prince of Montenegro|Danilo Petrovic]], Montenegrins are under the theocratic rule of the [[Petrovi\u0107-Njego\u0161 dynasty|Petrovi\u0107 dynasty]]. Due to the impossibility of approach, due to the terrain of Montenegro, Bishop [[Petar I Petrovi\u0107-Njego\u0161|Petar I Petrovi\u0107 Njego\u0161]] cursed the tribes he was ruling, using their piety to inspire unity, and thus attempted to prevent the further slaughter of the fraternal people. After his death in 1830, [[Petar I Petrovi\u0107-Njego\u0161|Petar of Cetinje]] was buried in the monastery of the in [[Cetinje Monastery|Cetinje]] and was proclaimed a saint.\n[[File:Flag of Montenegro (1852\u20131905).svg|thumb|Flag of [[Principality of Montenegro]] ]]\nHis adopted son [[Petar II Petrovi\u0107-Njego\u0161|Petar II Petrovi\u0107 Njego\u0161]] ruled from 1830 until 1851. It is recorded as one of the greatest educators of the Serbian people in general. He wrote one of the most important works of the romantic epoch \"[[The Mountain Wreath|Mountain Wreath]]\" (regarded as one of the artistic foundations of Serbian nationalism), and he was also credited with bringing the final look of a Montenegrin hat, which is decorated with a black frame and represents the crown, more precisely, sorrow for the slavery of the Serbian people under Ottoman yoke. The top of the cap is red, symbolising blood, where 5 golden threads are engraved, thought to signify 5 centuries of slavery under the Turks. Within these golden threads there is a \"Cross\" with four Cyrillic letters (scores) S, a variant of the Byzantine Palaiologos tetragrammic cross, sometimes referred to as the variant of the [[Serbian cross]].\n[[File:Flag of Montenegro (1905\u20131918).svg|thumb|Flag of the [[Kingdom of Montenegro]] ]]\nHe ruled as a Bishop, but he also stood firm to see that Montenegro must be modernised. He built schools, roads, raised the Church, expanded the capital of [[Cetinje]]. After his death and funeral, he was succeeded by his nephew Prince [[Danilo I, Prince of Montenegro|Danilo Petrovi\u0107]] who ruled as the first secular ruler, with the title of Knjaz. Since then, Knja\u017eevina (Principality) of Montenegro was no longer a Prince-Bishopric, but a secular monarchy. This led to the opinion of the Turkish court that this change can lead to a major change in Montenegro, and a desire for \"independence\". In 1852, [[Omar Pasha|Omer-pasha]] sent a large army against the Montenegrins. A small Montenegrin army led by Prince Danilo's brother, Duke (Vojvoda) [[Mirko Petrovi\u0107-Njego\u0161|Mirko]], defended 30 remaining fighters in the monastery of the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]], [[Ostrog Monastery|Ostrog]] for 9 days. This is taken as the greatest heroic force of the people in those areas. One year later, Omer-pasha again tried to conquer Montenegro, but with the great heroism of Vojvoda Mirko, the Montenegrins performed the greatest victory over the Ottomans in the new century, after which Montenegro gained essential autonomy, the highest degree to independence, and a few decades later, full independence. [[Danilo I, Prince of Montenegro|Prince Danilo]] dies in 1860, and Danilo's adoptive son came to the throne, biological son of Vojvoda [[Mirko Petrovi\u0107-Njego\u0161|Mirko]], [[Nicholas I of Montenegro|Nikola Petrovi\u0107]]. He remained remembered in Montenegro as the greatest ruler, owing in large part to the fact that he was the first modern-day King of Montenegro and that it was under him that Montenegro's independence had been recognised. He is of great importance for the Montenegrin people in general, because he has fought against the Ottomans in the territory of Montenegro, Herzegovina, and Bosnia, and the people often called him \"Emperor of the Heroes\". Immediately after coming to power, a [[Herzegovina uprising (1852\u201362)|war]] for the liberation of the Montenegrin people in [[Herzegovina]] started in 1862, in which [[Principality of Montenegro]] entered, but later it turned out that she entered extremely unprepared and soon after that peace was made. After returning from Russia, the then emperor [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]] enlightened him, and immediately upon his arrival he began to work hard for the urbanisation of the country. He revised the army completely, built many courts and schools, and Montenegro began to look like a European state. In 1876, with the [[Principality of Serbia]] and the [[Obrenovi\u0107 dynasty]], he started a war, in history known as \"[[Herzegovina uprising (1875\u20131877)|War for the Liberation of the Serbian People]]\".\n\nA couple of years before the war, Prince [[Nicholas I of Montenegro|Nikola Petrovi\u0107]] with the Serbian prince [[Mihailo Obrenovi\u0107]] made an alliance in Venice, where beside the military alliance, a contract was signed on the dynastic heritage of the new future unified joint state. It was said that the plan is for Serbia to go back to its historical borders ([[De Administrando Imperio|On the management of the Empire]]) from the [[Timok]] River to the [[Una (Sava)|Una]] peak. The Montenegrin federal unit would be an integral part of the new common state, and in it [[Petrovi\u0107-Njego\u0161 dynasty|Petrovi\u0107 dynasty]] would have the title of the princes, while the [[Obrenovi\u0107 dynasty]] would wear a royal crown. The Montenegrins performed great victories, and by the end of the war at the [[Congress of Berlin|Berlin Congress]] in 1878, the Principality of Montenegro received recognized independence, and became an internationally recognized state. This act raised the then two Serbian states to the ranks of independence, and it meant encouragement for all Serbs to completely resist the Turkish occupation in all Serbian countries. After the war, [[Nicholas I of Montenegro|Prince Nikola]] wrote all his famous works, and the most famous work is the folk anthem \"[[Onamo, 'namo!|Onamo' namo!]] \", According to many, the most beautiful Serbian song about Kosovo. In 1910, then Prince Nikola, with the permission of the great powers of the [[Kingdom of Serbia]] and [[Peter I of Serbia|King Peter]], proclaimed another Serbian kingdom in the Balkans: the [[Kingdom of Montenegro]]. The flag of the new state has become a flagrant national flag (a Serbian tricolor with the coat of arms of [[Petrovi\u0107-Njego\u0161 dynasty|Petrovi\u0107-Njegos dynasty]]), while with the old flag, it is equally used in the people and the popular \"crusader\" flag of Montenegrins. Knjazevina (Principality) of Montenegro, with the address of Russia, announces the war on Japan. Naturally, the participation of Montenegrins in this war was more symbolic, as the gratitude of Montenegro to Russia for generous help. In the [[Balkan Wars]], the [[Kingdom of Montenegro]] and the [[Kingdom of Serbia]] participated in the liberation battles in the [[old Serbia]] ([[Kosovo Vilayet|Kosovo]], [[Metohija]], and [[Sanjak of Novi Pazar|Ra\u0161ka]]) and [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]]. Thus, a common border was established between the two new-age \"Serb\" states, and the dream of [[Nicholas I of Montenegro|King Nikola]] about the liberation of the \"Serbian cradle\" (Kosovo) was realised. At the beginning of the [[World War I|First World War]], Montenegro immediately declared war on [[Austria-Hungary]], after [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]], but in 1916 it had to capitulate after all forces held a rally on the direction of Serbian withdrawal through Albania. After the passage of the Serbian government and the king, the crushed Montenegrin army sacrificed itself for the future of the Serbian state. [[Nicholas I of Montenegro|King Nikola]], already ill and in his late years, left his homeland. He went to [[France]], where he died.\n\nThe Montenegrins maintained their ''de-facto'' independence from the Ottoman Empire during the Ottoman's reign over most of the Balkan region (Bosnia, Serbia, Bulgaria, etc.). The Montenegrins were gathered around the Metropolitans of the Cetinje Metropolitanate, which led to further national awakening of the Montenegrins all around. The creation of a theocratic state and its advancement into a secular and independent country was even more evident in the late 15th and early 16th centuries.\n\nThe rule of the [[House of Petrovi\u0107]] in the 18th and 19th century unified the Montenegrins and established strong ties with Russia and later with Serbia (under Ottoman occupation), with occasional help from the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]]. That period was marked by numerous battles with Ottoman conquerors as well as by a firmer establishment of a self-governed principality.\n\nIn 1878, the [[Congress of Berlin]] recognised Montenegro as the 26th independent state in the world. Montenegro participated in the [[Balkan Wars]] of 1912\u20131913, as well as in [[World War I]] on the side of the Allies.\n\n===Yugoslav era===\nAfter the liberation of the Serbian and other Yugoslav (South Slavic) peoples, the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] was proclaimed, but the \"Venetian Agreement\" between the then [[Nicholas I of Montenegro|Prince Nikola]] and [[Mihailo Obrenovi\u0107|Prince Mihailo Obrenovi\u0107]] was breached. With the unification with the [[Kingdom of Serbia]], Montenegro was to have autonomy under the prince's dynasty [[Petrovi\u0107-Njego\u0161 dynasty|Petrovi\u0107-Njego\u0161]]. Due to this act, the Montenegrin public was divided on two sides. The first, majority party, better known as [[Whites (Montenegro)|Bjela\u0161i]] (\"The Whites\"), advocated unconditional unification with the Serbian Kingdom under the [[Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107 dynasty|Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107]] dynasty, while [[Greens (Montenegro)|Zelena\u0161i]] (\"The Greens\"), in a minority, advocated a conditional union that would respect the Venice Treaty. In Podgorica on October 26, 1918, the [[Podgorica Assembly]] unanimously voted that Montenegro unconditionally unites with Serbia into Yugoslavia, without any autonomy. Due to this decision, the few Greens are persecuted, and their rebellion is suppressed in the coming years. In 1929, with the proclamation of the Zeta Banovina with its headquarters in Podgorica, the territory of the former Montenegro with eastern Herzegovina and Metohija gained autonomy in the form of banovina (province), and the ruler of the region became a ban, whom the king personally appoints. [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia|King Aleksandar Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107]] ordered the construction of a chapel in [[Lov\u0107en]] in 1925, and the remains of, as many would say, \"the wisest Serb\" Prince-Bishop [[Petar II Petrovi\u0107-Njego\u0161|Petar II Petrovi\u0107 Njego\u0161]] were transferred there in a grandiose ceremony. At the beginning of the Second World War, the army in the [[Zeta Banovina]] area made great success against the Italian occupation of the army, expelling the Italian army to [[Shkod\u00ebr|Shkodra]] in [[Albania]]. After the breakup of the Yugoslav state, Montenegro gets a puppet government led by [[Sekula Drljevi\u0107]], who will be expelled from the country later.\n\nMontenegro unconditionally joined Serbia on November 26, 1918 in a controversial decision of the [[Podgorica Assembly]], and soon afterwards became a part of the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes]], later renamed [[Yugoslavia]]. A number of Montenegrin chieftains, disappointed by the effective disappearance of Montenegro, which they perceived to have resulted from political manipulation, rose up in arms during January 1919 in an uprising known as the [[Christmas Uprising|Christmas Rebellion]], which was crushed in a severe, comprehensive military campaign by 1922\u201323. Annexation of the [[Kingdom of Montenegro]] on November 13, 1918 gained international recognition only at the Conference of Ambassadors in [[Paris]], held on July 13, 1922.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.orderofdanilo.org/en/family/index.htm|title=Interesting things about the royal order of Montenegro - Untitled|website=Orderofdanilo.org|accessdate=2017-08-19|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090516203805/http://www.orderofdanilo.org/en/family/index.htm|archivedate=2009-05-16}}</ref> In 1929 the newly renamed [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] was reorganised into provinces (''banovine'') one of which, [[Zeta Banovina]], encompassed the old Kingdom of Montenegro and had [[Cetinje]] as its administrative centre.\n\nBetween the two world wars, the [[Communist Party of Yugoslavia]] opposed the Yugoslav monarchy and its unification policy, and supported Montenegrin autonomy, gaining considerable support in Montenegro. During [[World War II]], many Montenegrins joined the [[Yugoslav partisans|Yugoslav partisan]] forces, although the portion joining the [[chetniks]] was also significant. One third of all officers in the partisan army were Montenegrins. They also gave a disproportionate number of highest-ranked party officials and generals. During WWII [[Italy]] occupied Montenegro (in 1941) and annexed to the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861\u20131946)|Kingdom of Italy]] the area of Kotor, where there was a small Roman community (descendants from the populations of the renaissance-era [[Albania Veneta]]).\n\nWhen the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|second Yugoslavia]] was formed in 1945, the Communists who led the Partisans during the war formed the new r\u00e9gime. They recognised, sanctioned, and fostered a national identity of Montenegrins as a people distinct from the Serbs and other South Slavs. The number of people who were registered as Montenegrins in Montenegro was 90% in 1948; it had been dropping since, to 62% in 1991. With the rise of Serbian nationalism in the late 80's the number of citizens who declared themselves Montenegrin dropped sharply from 61.7%, in the 1991 census, to 43.16% in 2003. For a detailed overview of these trends, see the [[Demographic history of Montenegro]].\n\nAfter the end of the [[World War II|Second World War]], the official position of the Montenegrin assembly is: ''The Montenegrin nation is the purest ethnic group among the Serbs''.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=\u0421\u0442\u043e\u0458\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u045b|first=\u0417\u0434\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0430|date=2013-01-01|journal=Godi\u0161njak Pravnog Fakulteta U Banja Luci|volume=1|issue=35|pages=111|doi=10.7251/gpf1335111s|issn=2233-0429|title=\u041e \u041f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043d\u043e\u043c \u0421\u0442\u0430\u0442\u0443\u0441\u0443 \u0418 \u041e\u0432\u043b\u0430\u0448\u045b\u0435\u045a\u0438\u043c\u0430 \u041d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043d\u0435 \u0421\u043a\u0443\u043f\u0448\u0442\u0438\u043d\u0435 \u0423 \u0421\u0440\u0431\u0438\u0458\u0438 1858 \u2013 1888|doi-access=free}}</ref> The Yugoslav state recognised Montenegrins as a separate nation, different from Serbs and other Slavs, and gave them their own statistical code at the 1948 population census, where about 90% of Montenegrin citizens declared themselves Montenegrin.\n\nDuring communism in the new SFRY, the flag of the SR of Montenegro was identical with the flag of the SR of Serbia, where it was a Serbian tricolour with a five-pointed star in the middle, while the Coat of Arms was a tower by the sea, surrounded by a wreath, wrapped with a Serbian tricolour. By introducing standards for the new Montenegrin nation, the people of Montenegro were confused, but it was explained that the Montenegrin nation was \"the purest among the Serbs\", and the entire people of Montenegro (predominantly the Orthodox part) expressed themselves as Montenegrin, not imagining it would later mean a separation from the Serb ethnic identity. The Serb identity in Montenegro is usually perceived as separate from the Serbian identity, considering the Serbs as a larger ethnic group separated into Serbians, Montenegrins, and others depending on the polity they come from.\n\nInitially, after the fall of Communism in the early 1990s, the idea of a distinct Montenegrin ethnic identity had been taken over by independence-minded Montenegrins. The ruling [[Democratic Party of Socialists of Montenegro|Democratic Party of Socialists]] (DPS) (rebranded Communist Party), led by Prime Minister [[Milo \u0110ukanovi\u0107]] and President [[Momir Bulatovi\u0107]], was firmly allied with [[Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107]] throughout this period and opposed such movements.\n\nDuring the [[Bosnian War]] and [[Croatian War]] (1991\u20131995) Montenegro participated with its [[police]] and paramilitary forces in the attacks on [[Dubrovnik]] and Bosnian towns along with Serbian troops. It conducted persecutions against Bosniak refugees who were arrested by the Montenegrin police and transported to Serb camps in Fo\u010da, where they were executed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bosnjaci.net/aktuelno.php?id=4311|title=PORODICA NED\u017dIBA LOJE O NJEGOVOM HAP\u0160ENJU I DEPORTACIJI 1992.

Part of the army from the then SR of Montenegro is attacking Herzegovina and [[Dubrovnik]], and keeps Dubrovnik under [[Siege of Dubrovnik|siege]] for almost eight months. In this period, the Montenegrins have an old sense of national affiliation, and at a referendum almost 100% of the respondents who voted on the referendum declare that they want to stay in the new state the neighbourhood of Serbia and Montenegro, the [[Serbia and Montenegro|Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]]. During the siege of Dubrovnik, the Serbian (Montenegrin) paramilitary formation invents the saying: \"From [[Lov\u0107en]] a fairy salutes, where are you Serbian Dubrovnik!\" (''Serbian: \"\u0421\u0430 \u041b\u043e\u0432\u045b\u0435\u043d\u0430 \u0432\u0438\u043b\u0430 \u043a\u043b\u0438\u0447\u0435, \u0452\u0435 \u0441\u0438 \u0441\u0440\u043f\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0414\u0443\u0431\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043d\u0438\u0447\u0435!\"''), which has been taken many times as a verse with a negative connotation, because of the city being besieged for so much time. After the abolition of communism and the creation of a new state, the [[Republic of Montenegro (1992\u20132006)|federal unit of the Republic of Montenegro]] receives a new flag and the coat-of-arms, where the flag was a classic Montenegrin national flag (a Serbian tricolour with blue colour), while the coat of arms of the Coat of Arms is taken from the historical emblem of [[Petrovi\u0107-Njego\u0161 dynasty|Petrovi\u0107]]. Then, the great fighters for the joint [[Serbia and Montenegro|FRY]], [[Momir Bulatovi\u0107]] and [[Milo \u0110ukanovi\u0107]], together with [[Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107]], rule the state union. The paths of [[Milo \u0110ukanovi\u0107]] and [[Momir Bulatovi\u0107]] diverge before the start of the NATO aggression against the [[Serbia and Montenegro|FRY]], and [[Milo \u0110ukanovi\u0107]] begins to change attitudes drastically, starting first with the political attitudes and afterwards the national and religious. In 1997 a full-blown rift occurred within DPS, and \u0110ukanovi\u0107's faction won over Bulatovi\u0107's, who formed a new [[Socialist People's Party of Montenegro]] (SNP). The DPS distanced itself from Milo\u0161evi\u0107 and gradually took over the independence idea from the [[Liberal Alliance of Montenegro]] and the [[Social Democratic Party of Montenegro|SDP]], and has won all elections since. In the fall of 1999, shortly after the [[NATO]] bombing of Yugoslavia, the \u0110ukanovi\u0107-led Montenegrin leadership came out with a platform for the re-definition of relations within the federation that called for more Montenegrin involvement in the areas of defence and foreign policy, though the platform fell short of pushing for independence. After Milo\u0161evi\u0107's overthrow on October 5, 2000, \u0110ukanovi\u0107 for the first time came out in support of full independence. Montenegro started increasingly moving away from Serbia, and in 2003, the Parliament of Montenegro sought amendments to the Constitution. With these amendments, and the [[Republic of Montenegro (1992\u20132006)|Federal Unit of Montenegro]] was allowed to call a referendum on independence, which took place on 21 May 2006.\n\nWhen the referendum was announced, independence was obtained by a narrow majority. However, the bar was set high in order to avoid any dispute after the vote, with the requirement for a 55% of votes in favour of independence. Since the proclamation of independence, the policy of making a new ethnic identity is even more intensified by official Montenegro, often used for political purposes, whereas the citizens still remain divided on the issue of ethnic identity.\n\n==Language==\n{{Main|Montenegrin language|Serbo-Croatian language}}\nMontenegrins speak [[Montenegrin language|Montenegrin]], an [[Ijekavian]] variant of the [[Shtokavian dialect]] of the [[pluricentric]] [[Serbo-Croatian]] language. Neo-shtokavian Eastern-Herzegovinian sub-dialect is spoken in the North-West (largest city Nik\u0161i\u0107), and old shtokavian Zeta sub-dialect is spoken in the rest of Montenegro, including capital Podgorica and the Old Royal Capital of Cetinje, and eastern [[Sanjak]].\n\nThe Zeta dialect features additional sounds: a [[voiceless alveolo-palatal fricative]] ({{IPA|/\u0255/}}), [[voiced alveolo-palatal fricative]] *({{IPA|/\u0291/}}, (occurring in other jekavian dialects as well) and a [[voiced alveolar affricate]] ({{IPA|dz}}, shared with other old-\u0161tokavian dialects). Both sub-dialects are characterised by highly specific accents (shared with other old-\u0161tokavian dialects) and several \"hyper-ijekavisms\" (i.e. ''nijesam'', where the rest of shtokavian area uses ''nisam'') and \"hyper-[[iotation]]s\" (''\u0111evojka'' for ''djevojka'', ''\u0111eca'' for ''djeca'' etc.) (these features, especially the hyper-iotation, are more prominent in the Zeta sub-dialect), that are common in all Montenegrin vernaculars.\n\nOn the [[sociolinguistic]] level, the language has been classified as a dialect of [[Serbo-Croatian language|Serbo-Croat]]. The Montenegrin constitution currently defines Montenegrin as the official language. Since the campaign for independence, a movement for recognition of the [[Montenegrin language]] as wholly separate from Serbian and other standard variants of Serbo-Croat (Bosnian, Croatian) has emerged, finding the basis for separate language identity mostly in the above-mentioned dialectal specifics. In the 2011 census, 42.88% of Montenegrin citizens stated that they speak the Serbian language, while 36.97% stated that they speak Montenegrin. Most of the young people under 18 in Montenegro, 39.23 percent, say they speak Montenegrin, while 37.47% call their mother tongue Serbian, as shown in the census held from 1 to 15 April 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vijesti.me/vijesti/drustvo/vecina-mladih-do-18-godina-govori-crnogorskim-jezikom|title=Ve\u0107ina mladih do 18 godina govori crnogorskim jezikom|website=Vijesti.me|date=July 26, 2011|accessdate=29 July 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Religion==\n{{further|Religion in Montenegro}}\nMost Montenegrins are [[Serbian Orthodox Church|Serbian Orthodox]], predominantly belonging to the [[Metropolitanate of Montenegro and the Littoral]] of the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]] as well as its four other eparchies (dioceses) that are active in parts of Montenegro and neighbouring countries, namely the [[Eparchy of Budimlja and Nik\u0161i\u0107]], the [[Eparchy of Mile\u0161eva]], and the [[Eparchy of Zahumlje and Herzegovina]]. A very small minority are adherents of the non-canonical and unrecognised [[Montenegrin Orthodox Church]].\n\nAccording to the census of 2011, people that declared Montenegrin as their ethnicity declared the following religious identity: \n*[[Eastern Orthodox]]: 248,523 (88.7%)\n*[[Islam in Montenegro|Islam]]: 12,931 (4.6%)\n*[[Catholic Church in Montenegro|Catholic]]: 5,667 (2.0%)\n*[[Protestantism in Montenegro|Protestantism]]: 921 (0.3%)\n*[[Atheism]]/[[Agnosticism]]: 6,393 (2.3%)\n*Others: 5,883 (2.1%)\n\n==Culture==\n{{Main|Culture of Montenegro}}\n[[File:Montenegrin Herzegovinian costume.jpg|Male folk costume from Montenegro|thumb]]\nThe most important dimension of Montenegrins' culture is the [[ethic]]al ideal of ''\u010cojstvo i juna\u0161tvo'', roughly translated as \"Chivalry and Bravery\". Another result of its centuries-long [[warrior]] history, is the unwritten code of [[Chivalry]] that [[Marko Miljanov]], one of the most famous warriors in his time, tried to describe in his book ''Primjeri \u010dojstva i juna\u0161tva'' (Examples of Humanity and Bravery) at the end of 19th century. Its main principles stipulate that to deserve a true respect of its people, a warrior has to show virtues of [[integrity]], [[dignity]], [[humility]], [[self-sacrifice]] for the just cause if necessary, [[respect]] for others, and [[wiktionary:Rectitude|Rectitude]], along with the [[bravery]]. In the old days of battle, it resulted in Montenegrins fighting to the death, since being captured was considered the greatest [[shame]]. Miljanov defined the two characteristics in a maxim roughly translated as: \"Bravery is when I defend myself from the other, chivalry is when I defend the other from myself\" (''\"Juna\u0161tvo je kada sebe branim od drugoga, \u010dojstvo je kada drugoga branim od sebe\"'').\n\nThis ethos is still an important part of most Montenegrins' ethical belief system, and understanding it is essential in order to understand Montenegrin identity and self-perception. Most of extraordinary examples of Montenegrin conduct during its long history can be traced to the code.\n\nMontenegrins' long-standing history of fighting for independence is invariably linked with strong traditions of folk [[epic poetry]]. A prominent feature of Montenegrin culture is the [[gusle]], a one-stringed instrument played by a story-teller who sings or recites stories of heroes and battles in [[decasyllable|decasyllabic verse]]. These traditions are stronger in the northern parts of the country and are also shared with people in eastern [[Herzegovina]], western [[Serbia]], northern [[Albania]], and central [[Dalmatia]].\n\nOn the substratum of folk epic poetry, poets like [[Petar II Petrovi\u0107 Njego\u0161]], widely considered the most one of the most brilliant Montenegrins and Southern Slavs in history, have created their own expression. Njego\u0161's epic book ''Gorski Vijenac'' (''[[The Mountain Wreath]]'') presents the central point of Montenegrin culture as struggle for freedom.\n\nOn the other hand, Adriatic cities like [[Herceg-Novi]], [[Kotor]], and [[Budva]] had strong trading and maritime traditions, and were more open for [[Venetian Republic|Venetian]], [[Republic of Ragusa|Ragusan]], and other [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] influences. Possession of those cities often changed, but their population was basically a mixture of people with Orthodox and Catholic religions and traditions. These cities were incorporated into Montenegro only after the fall of Austria-Hungary. In those cities, stronger influences of medieval and renaissance [[architecture]], [[painting]], and [[lyric poetry]] can be found, and while the adherence to the principles of chivalry and bravery are part of their ethos they are usually less central than in the areas of \"old Montenegro\".\n\n==Anthropology==\nVlahovi\u0107 (2008) noted many [[Biological anthropology|anthropological studies]] which showed that Montenegrin people have strong [[Dinaric race|Dinaric]] type (with seaboard, central, Durmitor, mountain and other subtypes) autochthonous on the [[Dinaric Alps]] since the Mesolithic period. Dinaric peoples, including Montenegrins, are among the tallest people in the world. The type, particularly in Montenegro, is distinguished by brachiochepal shape, broad forehead, wide relief and strong face, wide jaw and noticeably flat notched head, while arms and legs are proportional to the body height.

The club was founded in 1898 and currently plays in [[Championnat National]], the third division of [[French football]], having been relegated from [[Ligue 2]] during the [[2011-12 Ligue 2|2011\u201312 season]].\n\nThe club was formed in 1898 and its achievements are minor with their biggest feat consisting of reaching the semi-finals during the 1936\u201337 edition of the [[Coupe de France]]. Boulogne play their home matches at the [[Stade de la Lib\u00e9ration]], which seats 15,004 having previously seated only 7,000 prior to its renovation in 2007.\n\n== History ==\nUS Boulogne were founded in December 1898 by a group of young athletes. While they mainly focussed originally on athletic events, they moved into the football industry and made a decent job in their first few years as a football club. Boulogne won the Maritime Championship three years running between 1904 and 1906. They next won the Championship in 1909 and their final victory of this division was in 1922. In 1924, Boulogne moved to the Northern Championship and fared well. The team also did well in the [[Coupe de France]]&nbsp;\u2013 reaching the quarter-finals in 1929 and the last 16 three times.\n\nIn 1926, Boulogne won the Northern League and only six years later, they became a professional club. In 1935, under chairman Marcel Lacroix, the team joined the professional leagues. However, they played averagely in Division Two but there were a few bright sparks in the team. The Coupe de France 1937 competition saw Boulogne make the semi-finals, but they were convincingly beaten by [[FC Sochaux]] 6\u20130. After the war, Boulogne reverted to amateur status&nbsp;\u2013 and only became a professional team again in 1957 when they were re-elected into Division Two. They stayed in Division Two for 22 years but plummeted through the divisions&nbsp;\u2013 suffering consecutive relegations. The Coupe de France competition only provided little respite, as the team made the last 16 three times.\n\nRobert Senechal arrived in 1983 and stabilised the club in Division Four. They missed out on promotion by a narrow margin in 1984&nbsp;\u2013 but were promoted in 1991. However, it was short-lived and they were relegated once again from whence they came. In June 1994, it was announced that Boulogne were in serious debt&nbsp;\u2013 owing  \u20a33&nbsp;million. However, mayor and billionaire John Muselet intervened to save the club and appointed Jacques Wattez as chairman. Under the leadership of Wattez, the club adopted a new name&nbsp;\u2013 Union Sportive Boulogne C\u00f4te d'Opale&nbsp;\u2013 in July 1994. The debts of the club were wiped and Boulogne&nbsp;\u2013 although still struggling in Division Four&nbsp;\u2013 reached the last sixteen of the Coupe de France again in 1997. They earned a home tie against Ligue 1 side [[Olympique de Marseille]]. Although, Boulogne battled their way through the match, they narrowly lost 1\u20130.\n\nBoulogne were slowly building their team in the [[Championnat National]] and under manager [[Philippe Montanier]], the club clinched promotion to [[Ligue 2]] with a tense 2\u20131 victory over [[SC Toulon]]. However, Boulogne were initially blocked from playing in Ligue 2 due to financial problems but after hard work, they were given the green light to play in that league for the [[Ligue 2 2007\u201308|2007\u20132008 season]]. They struggled that season and on the final day, they were occupying the final relegation spot, one point from safety. Boulogne played at home to [[Chamois Niortais FC]], who were one place above Boulogne. A tense game saw Boulogne win the match in the 95th minute through defender [[Damien Perrinelle]] and it kept Boulogne up whilst sending [[Chamois Niortais FC|Niort]] down to the Championnat National.\n\nThe [[Ligue 2 2008-09|2008\u201309 season]] saw Boulogne do the opposite from last season and win promotion on the final day of the season after beating [[SC Amiens]] 4\u20130, replacing Strasbourg in the final promotion place by a single point. Striker [[Gr\u00e9gory Thil]] finished top scorer with 18 goals as the side made their first ever appearance in the [[Ligue 1]].\n\n== Players ==\n\n=== Current squad ===\n{{updated|3 March 2020.|<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usbco.com/equipe-pro-s17.html|title= Equipe pro |publisher=[[US Boulogne]] |language=fr|accessdate=3 March 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://int.soccerway.com/teams/france/union-sportive-de-boulogne-cote-dopale/2559/squad/|title=US Boulogne-sur-Mer C\u00f4te d'Opale Squad|publisher=Soccerway|accessdate=3 March 2020}}</ref>}}\n\n{{Fs start}}\n{{Fs player|no= 1|nat=CMR|pos=GK|name=[[Guy N'dy Assemb\u00e9]]}}\n{{Fs player|no= 2|nat=FRA|pos=DF|name=Noha Cadiou}}\n{{Fs player|no= 3|nat=FRA|pos=DF|name=[[Anthony Scaramozzino]]}}\n{{Fs player|no= 4|nat=FRA|pos=DF|name=Edouard Daillet}}\n{{Fs player|no= 5|nat=GLP|natvar=local|pos=DF|name=[[M\u00e9ddy Lina]]}}\n{{Fs player|no= 6|nat=FRA|pos=MF|name=Ma\u00ebl Illien}}\n{{Fs player|no= 7|nat=FRA|pos=MF|name=[[Evens Joseph]]|other=on loan from [[Stade Malherbe Caen|Caen]]}}\n{{Fs player|no= 9|nat=FRA|pos=FW|name=Lenny L\u00e9onil}}\n{{Fs player|no=10|nat=MAR|pos=FW|name=Said Idazza}}\n{{Fs player|no=11|nat=CMR|pos=FW|name=[[Paul Garita]]|other=on loan from [[R.

C\u00f4te d'Opale''' (commonly referred to as '''US Boulogne''' or simply '''Boulogne''') is a [[Football in France|French association football]] club based in the [[Communes of France|commune]] of [[Boulogne-sur-Mer]]. The club was founded in 1898 and currently plays in [[Championnat National]], the third division of [[French football]], having been relegated from [[Ligue 2]] during the [[2011-12 Ligue 2|2011\u201312 season]].\n\nThe club was formed in 1898 and its achievements are minor with their biggest feat consisting of reaching the semi-finals during the 1936\u201337 edition of the [[Coupe de France]]. Boulogne play their home matches at the [[Stade de la Lib\u00e9ration]], which seats 15,004 having previously seated only 7,000 prior to its renovation in 2007.\n\n== History ==\nUS Boulogne were founded in December 1898 by a group of young athletes. While they mainly focussed originally on athletic events, they moved into the football industry and made a decent job in their first few years as a football club. Boulogne won the Maritime Championship three years running between 1904 and 1906. They next won the Championship in 1909 and their final victory of this division was in 1922. In 1924, Boulogne moved to the Northern Championship and fared well. The team also did well in the [[Coupe de France]]&nbsp;\u2013 reaching the quarter-finals in 1929 and the last 16 three times.\n\nIn 1926, Boulogne won the Northern League and only six years later, they became a professional club. In 1935, under chairman Marcel Lacroix, the team joined the professional leagues. However, they played averagely in Division Two but there were a few bright sparks in the team. The Coupe de France 1937 competition saw Boulogne make the semi-finals, but they were convincingly beaten by [[FC Sochaux]] 6\u20130. After the war, Boulogne reverted to amateur status&nbsp;\u2013 and only became a professional team again in 1957 when they were re-elected into Division Two. They stayed in Division Two for 22 years but plummeted through the divisions&nbsp;\u2013 suffering consecutive relegations. The Coupe de France competition only provided little respite, as the team made the last 16 three times.\n\nRobert Senechal arrived in 1983 and stabilised the club in Division Four. They missed out on promotion by a narrow margin in 1984&nbsp;\u2013 but were promoted in 1991. However, it was short-lived and they were relegated once again from whence they came. In June 1994, it was announced that Boulogne were in serious debt&nbsp;\u2013 owing  \u20a33&nbsp;million. However, mayor and billionaire John Muselet intervened to save the club and appointed Jacques Wattez as chairman. Under the leadership of Wattez, the club adopted a new name&nbsp;\u2013 Union Sportive Boulogne C\u00f4te d'Opale&nbsp;\u2013 in July 1994. The debts of the club were wiped and Boulogne&nbsp;\u2013 although still struggling in Division Four&nbsp;\u2013 reached the last sixteen of the Coupe de France again in 1997. They earned a home tie against Ligue 1 side [[Olympique de Marseille]]. Although, Boulogne battled their way through the match, they narrowly lost 1\u20130.\n\nBoulogne were slowly building their team in the [[Championnat National]] and under manager [[Philippe Montanier]], the club clinched promotion to [[Ligue 2]] with a tense 2\u20131 victory over [[SC Toulon]]. However, Boulogne were initially blocked from playing in Ligue 2 due to financial problems but after hard work, they were given the green light to play in that league for the [[Ligue 2 2007\u201308|2007\u20132008 season]].

Angles are also formed by the intersection of two planes in [[Euclidean space|Euclidean and other spaces]]. These are called [[dihedral angle]]s. Angles formed by the intersection of two curves in a plane are defined as the angle determined by the tangent rays at the point of intersection. Similar statements hold in space, for example, the [[spherical angle]] formed by two [[great circle]]s on a [[sphere]] is the dihedral angle between the planes determined by the great circles.\n\n''Angle'' is also used to designate the [[measure (mathematics)|measure]] of an angle or of a [[Rotation (mathematics)|rotation]]. This measure is the ratio of the length of a [[arc (geometry)|circular arc]] to its [[radius]]. In the case of a geometric angle, the arc is centered at the vertex and delimited by the sides. In the case of a rotation, the arc is centered at the center of the rotation and delimited by any other point and its image by the rotation.\n\nThe word ''angle'' comes from the [[Latin]] word ''angulus'', meaning \"corner\"; [[cognate]] words are the [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|\u1f00\u03b3\u03ba\u03cd\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2}} ''(ankyl\u03bfs)'', meaning \"crooked, curved,\" and the [[English language|English]] word \"[[ankle]]\".

According to [[Proclus]] an angle must be either a quality or a quantity, or a relationship. The first concept was used by [[Eudemus of Rhodes|Eudemus]], who regarded an angle as a deviation from a [[straight line]]; the second by [[Carpus of Antioch]], who regarded it as the interval or space between the intersecting lines; Euclid adopted the third concept, although his definitions of right, acute, and obtuse angles are certainly quantitative.<ref>{{harvnb|Chisholm|1911}}; {{harvnb|Heiberg|1908|pp=177\u2013178}}</ref><!-- This paragraph is quoted from EB1911, but its source seems to be Heath.-->\n\n==Identifying angles==\nIn mathematical expressions\n\n==Types of angles==\n{{Redirect|Oblique angle|the cinematographic technique|Dutch angle}}\n===Individual angles===\nThere is some common terminology for angles, whose measure is always non-negative (see [[#Positive and negative angles]]):\n* An angle equal to 0\u00b0 or not turned is called a zero angle.\n* Angles smaller than a right angle (less than 90\u00b0) are called ''acute angles'' (\"acute\" meaning \"sharp\").\n* An angle equal to {{sfrac|4}} turn (90\u00b0 or {{sfrac|{{math|\u03c0}}|2}} radians) is called a ''[[right angle]]''.

An angle is defined by its measure and is not dependent upon the lengths of the sides of the angle (e.g. all ''right angles'' are equal in measure).\n* Two angles which share terminal sides, but differ in size by an integer multiple of a turn, are called ''coterminal angles''.\n* A ''reference angle'' is the acute version of any angle determined by repeatedly subtracting or adding straight angle ({{sfrac|2}} turn, 180\u00b0, or {{math|\u03c0}} radians), to the results as necessary, until the magnitude of result is an acute angle, a value between 0 and {{sfrac|4}} turn, 90\u00b0, or {{sfrac|{{math|\u03c0}}|2}} radians. For example, an angle of 30 degrees has a reference angle of 30 degrees, and an angle of 150 degrees also has a reference angle of 30 degrees (180\u2013150). An angle of 750 degrees has a reference angle of 30 degrees (750\u2013720).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mathwords.com/r/reference_angle.htm|title=Mathwords: Reference Angle|website=www.mathwords.com|accessdate=26 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171023035017/http://www.mathwords.com/r/reference_angle.htm|archivedate=23 October 2017}}</ref>\n\n==={{anchor|adjacent}} Vertical and adjacent angle pairs===\n[[File:Vertical Angles.svg|thumb|150px|left|Angles A and B are a pair of vertical angles; angles C and D are a pair of vertical angles.]]\n\nWhen two straight lines intersect at a point, four angles are formed. Pairwise these angles are named according to their location relative to each other.\n* A pair of angles opposite each other, formed by two intersecting straight lines that form an \"X\"-like shape, are called ''vertical angles'' or ''opposite angles'' or ''vertically opposite angles''. They are abbreviated as ''vert. opp. \u2220s''.<ref name=\"tb\">{{harvnb|Wong|Wong|2009|pp=161\u2013163}}</ref>\n:The equality of vertically opposite angles is called the ''vertical angle theorem''. [[Eudemus of Rhodes]] attributed the proof to [[Thales|Thales of Miletus]].<ref>{{cite book|author=[[Euclid]]|title=The Elements||orig-year=300 BC|title-link=Euclid's Elements}} Proposition I:13.</ref>{{sfn|Shute| Shirk|Porter|1960|pp=25\u201327}} The proposition showed that since both of a pair of vertical angles are supplementary to both of the adjacent angles, the vertical angles are equal in measure. According to a historical note,{{sfn|Shute| Shirk|Porter|1960|pp=25\u201327}} when Thales visited Egypt, he observed that whenever the Egyptians drew two intersecting lines, they would measure the vertical angles to make sure that they were equal. Thales concluded that one could prove that all vertical angles are equal if one accepted some general notions such as: all straight angles are equal, equals added to equals are equal, and equals subtracted from equals are equal.\n\n:In the figure, assume the measure of Angle ''A'' = ''x''. When two adjacent angles form a straight line, they are supplementary. Therefore, the measure of Angle ''C'' = 180 \u2212 ''x''. Similarly, the measure of Angle ''D'' = 180 \u2212 ''x''. Both Angle ''C'' and Angle ''D'' have measures equal to 180 \u2212 ''x'' and are congruent. Since Angle ''B'' is supplementary to both Angles ''C'' and ''D'', either of these angle measures may be used to determine the measure of Angle ''B''. Using the measure of either Angle ''C'' or Angle ''D'' we find the measure of Angle ''B'' = 180 \u2212 (180 \u2212 ''x'') = 180 \u2212 180 + ''x'' = ''x''. Therefore, both Angle ''A'' and Angle ''B'' have measures equal to ''x'' and are equal in measure.\n\n[[File:Adjacentangles.svg|right|thumb|225px|Angles ''A'' and ''B'' are adjacent.]]\n* ''Adjacent angles'', often abbreviated as ''adj. \u2220s'', are angles that share a common vertex and edge but do not share any interior points. In other words, they are angles that are side by side, or adjacent, sharing an \"arm\". Adjacent angles which sum to a right angle, straight angle or full angle are special and are respectively called ''complementary'', ''supplementary'' and ''explementary'' angles (see \"Combine angle pairs\" below).\n\nA [[Transversal (geometry)|transversal]] is a line that intersects a pair of (often parallel) lines and is associated with ''alternate interior angles'', ''corresponding angles'', ''interior angles'', and ''exterior angles''.{{sfn|Jacobs|1974|p=255}}\n\n===Combining angle pairs===\nThere are three special angle pairs which involve the summation of angles:\n{{anchor|complementary angle}}\n[[File:Complement angle.svg|thumb|150px|The ''complementary'' angles <var>a</var> and <var>b</var> (<var>b</var> is the ''complement'' of <var>a</var>, and <var>a</var> is the complement of <var>b</var>).]]\n* ''Complementary angles'' are angle pairs whose measures sum to one right angle ({{sfrac|4}} turn, 90\u00b0, or {{sfrac|{{math|\u03c0}}|2}} radians). If the two complementary angles are adjacent their non-shared sides form a right angle. In Euclidean geometry, the two acute angles in a right triangle are complementary, because the sum of internal angles of a [[triangle]] is 180 degrees, and the right angle itself accounts for ninety degrees.\n:The adjective complementary is from Latin ''complementum'', associated with the verb ''complere'', \"to fill up\". An acute angle is \"filled up\" by its complement to form a right angle.\n:The difference between an angle and a right angle is termed the ''complement'' of the angle.<ref name=\"Chisholm 1911\">{{harvnb|Chisholm|1911}}</ref>\n:If angles ''A'' and ''B'' are complementary, the following relationships hold:\n:: <math>\n\\begin{align}\n& \\sin^2A + \\sin^2B = 1 & & \\cos^2A + \\cos^2B = 1 \\\\[3pt]\n& \\tan A = \\cot B  & & \\sec A = \\csc B\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n:(The [[tangent]] of an angle equals the [[cotangent]] of its complement and its secant equals the [[cosecant]] of its complement.)\n:The [[prefix]] \"[[co (function prefix)|co-]]\" in the names of some trigonometric ratios refers to the word \"complementary\".\n{{clear|right}}\n[[File:Angle obtuse acute straight.svg|thumb|right|300px|The angles <var>a</var> and <var>b</var> are ''supplementary'' angles.]]\n* {{anchor|Linear pair of angles|Supplementary angle}}Two angles that sum to a straight angle ({{sfrac|2}} turn, 180\u00b0, or {{math|\u03c0}} radians) are called ''supplementary angles''.\n:If the two supplementary angles are [[#adjacent|adjacent]] (i.e. have a common [[vertex (geometry)|vertex]] and share just one side), their non-shared sides form a [[line (geometry)|straight line]]. Such angles are called a ''linear pair of angles''.{{sfn|Jacobs|1974|p=97}} However, supplementary angles do not have to be on the same line, and can be separated in space.  For example, adjacent angles of a [[parallelogram]] are supplementary, and opposite angles of a [[cyclic quadrilateral]] (one whose vertices all fall on a single circle) are supplementary.\n:If a point P is exterior to a circle with center O, and if the [[tangent lines to circles|tangent lines]] from P touch the circle at points T and Q, then \u2220TPQ and \u2220TOQ are supplementary.\n:The sines of supplementary angles are equal. Their cosines and tangents (unless undefined) are equal in magnitude but have opposite signs.\n:In Euclidean geometry, any sum of two angles in a triangle is supplementary to the third, because the sum of internal angles of a triangle is a straight angle.\n{{clear|right}}\n{{anchor|explementary angle}}\n[[File:Reflex angle.svg|thumb|right|150px|Sum of two ''explementary'' angles is a ''complete'' angle.]]\n* Two angles that sum to a complete angle (1 turn, 360\u00b0, or 2{{math|\u03c0}} radians) are called ''explementary angles'' or ''conjugate angles''.\n*: The difference between an angle and a complete angle is termed the ''explement'' of the angle or ''conjugate'' of an angle.\n{{clear|right}}\n\n===Polygon-related angles===\n[[File:ExternalAngles.svg|thumb|300px|right|Internal and external angles.]]\n* An angle that is part of a [[simple polygon]] is called an ''[[interior angle]]'' if it lies on the inside of that simple polygon. A simple [[concave polygon]] has at least one interior angle that is a reflex angle.\n*: In [[Euclidean geometry]], the measures of the interior angles of a [[triangle]] add up to {{math|\u03c0}} radians, 180\u00b0, or {{sfrac|2}} turn; the measures of the interior angles of a simple [[convex polygon|convex]] [[quadrilateral]] add up to 2{{math|\u03c0}} radians, 360\u00b0, or 1 turn. In general, the measures of the interior angles of a simple convex [[polygon]] with ''n'' sides add up to (''n''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;2){{math|\u03c0}} radians, or 180(''n''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;2) degrees, (2''n''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;4) right angles, or ({{sfrac|''n''|2}}&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1) turn.\n* The supplement of an interior angle is called an ''[[exterior angle]]'', that is, an interior angle and an exterior angle form a [[#Linear pair of angles|linear pair of angles]]. There are two exterior angles at each vertex of the polygon, each determined by extending one of the two sides of the polygon that meet at the vertex; these two angles are vertical angles and hence are equal. An exterior angle measures the amount of rotation one has to make at a vertex to trace out the polygon.{{sfn|Henderson|Taimina|2005|p=104}} If the corresponding interior angle is a reflex angle, the exterior angle should be considered [[Negative number|negative]]. Even in a non-simple polygon it may be possible to define the exterior angle, but one will have to pick an [[orientation (mathematics)|orientation]] of the [[plane (mathematics)|plane]] (or [[surface (mathematics)|surface]]) to decide the sign of the exterior angle measure.\n*: In Euclidean geometry, the sum of the exterior angles of a simple convex polygon will be one full turn (360\u00b0). The exterior angle here could be called a ''supplementary exterior angle''. Exterior angles are commonly used in [[Logo (programming language)|Logo Turtle programs]] when drawing regular polygons.\n* In a [[triangle]], the [[bisection|bisectors]] of two exterior angles and the bisector of the other interior angle are [[concurrent lines|concurrent]] (meet at a single point).<ref name=Johnson>Johnson, Roger A.

Angles that have the same size are said to be ''equal'' or ''congruent'' or ''equal in measure''.\n\nIn some contexts, such as identifying a point on a circle or describing the ''orientation'' of an object in two dimensions relative to a reference orientation, angles that differ by an exact multiple of a full [[Turn (geometry)|turn]] are effectively equivalent.  In other contexts, such as identifying a point on a [[spiral]] curve or describing the ''cumulative rotation'' of an object in two dimensions relative to a reference orientation, angles that differ by a non-zero multiple of a full turn are not equivalent.\n\n[[File:Angle measure.svg|right|thumb|The measure of angle <var>\u03b8</var> (in radians) is the quotient of <var>s</var> and <var>r</var>.]]\n\nIn order to measure an angle <var>[[theta|\u03b8]]</var>, a [[circular arc]] centered at the vertex of the angle is drawn, e.g. with a pair of [[Compasses (drafting)|compasses]]. The ratio of the length <var>s</var> of the arc by the radius <var>r</var> of the circle is the measure of the angle in [[radian]]s.\n\nThe measure of the angle in another angular unit is then obtained by multiplying its measure in radians by the scaling factor {{sfrac|''k''|2{{pi}}}}, where ''k'' is the measure of a complete turn in the chosen unit (for example 360 for [[degree (angle)|degrees]] or 400 for [[gradian]]s):\n\n:<math> \\theta = k \\frac{s}{2\\pi r}. </math>\n\nThe value of <var>\u03b8</var> thus defined is independent of the size of the circle: if the length of the radius is changed then the arc length changes in the same proportion, so the ratio ''s''/''r'' is unaltered. (Proof. The formula above can be rewritten as {{nowrap|1 = ''k'' = {{sfrac|''\u03b8r''|''s''}}.}} One turn, for which {{nowrap|1 = ''\u03b8'' = ''n''}} units, corresponds to an arc equal in length to the circle's [[circumference]], which is 2{{math|\u03c0}}''r'', so {{nowrap|1 = ''s'' = 2{{math|\u03c0}}''r''}}. Substituting ''n'' for ''\u03b8'' and 2{{math|\u03c0}}''r'' for ''s'' in the formula, results in {{nowrap|1 = ''k'' = {{sfrac|''nr''|2{{math|\u03c0}}''r''}} = {{sfrac|''n''|2{{math|\u03c0}}}}.}}) {{refn|group=\"nb\"|This approach requires however an additional proof that the measure of the angle does not change with changing radius <var>r</var>, in addition to the issue of \"measurement units chosen.\" A smoother approach is to measure the angle by the length of the corresponding unit circle arc. Here \"unit\" can be chosen to be dimensionless in the sense that it is the real number 1 associated with the unit segment on the real line. See Radoslav M.

Of these units, the ''[[degree (angle)|degree]]'' and the ''[[radian]]'' are by far the most commonly used.  Angles expressed in radians are dimensionless for the purposes of [[dimensional analysis]].\n\nMost units of angular measurement are defined such that one ''[[Turn (geometry)|turn]]''  (i.e. one full circle) is equal to ''n'' units, for some whole number ''n''.  The two exceptions are the radian and the diameter part.\n\n;[[turn (geometry)|Turn]] (''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1): The ''turn'', also ''cycle'', ''full circle'', ''revolution'', and ''rotation'', is complete circular movement or measure (as to return to the same point) with circle or ellipse.  A turn is abbreviated {{mvar|\u03c4}}, ''cyc'', ''rev'', or ''rot'' depending on the application, but in the acronym ''[[Revolutions per minute|rpm]]'' (revolutions per minute), just ''r'' is used. A ''turn'' of ''n'' units is obtained by setting {{nowrap|1 = ''k'' = {{sfrac|2{{pi}}}}}} in the formula above. The equivalence of 1 ''turn'' is 360\u00b0, 2{{pi}} rad, 400 grad, and 4 right angles. The symbol {{mvar|\u03c4}} can also be used as a [[mathematical constant]] to represent 2{{pi}} radians. Used in this way ({{math|1= ''k'' = {{sfrac|\u03c4|2\u03c0}}}}) allows for radians to be expressed as a fraction of a turn. For example, half a turn is {{math|1 ={{sfrac|\u03c4|2}} = \u03c0}}.\n\n;[[Quadrant (circle)|Quadrant]] (''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;4): The ''quadrant'' is {{sfrac|4}} of a turn, i.e. a ''[[right angle]]''. It is the unit used in [[Euclid's Elements]]. 1 quad. = 90\u00b0 = {{sfrac|{{pi}}|2}}&nbsp;rad = {{sfrac|4}} turn = 100&nbsp;grad. In German the symbol <sup>\u221f</sup> has been used to denote a quadrant.\n\n;[[Sextant (circle)|Sextant]] (''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;6): The ''sextant'' (''angle of the [[equilateral triangle]]'') is {{sfrac|6}} of a turn. It was the unit used by the [[Babylonians]],<ref name=\"Jeans_1947\"/><ref name=\"Murnaghan_1946\"/> and is especially easy to construct with ruler and compasses. The degree, minute of arc and second of arc are [[sexagesimal]] subunits of the Babylonian unit. 1 Babylonian unit = 60\u00b0 = {{pi}}/3&nbsp;rad \u2248 1.047197551&nbsp;rad.\n[[File:Angle radian.svg|right|thumb|<var>\u03b8</var> = <var>s</var>/<var>r</var> rad = 1 rad.]]\n\n;[[Radian]] (''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp; 2{{pi}}&nbsp;=&nbsp; 6.283&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;): The ''[[radian]]'' is the angle subtended by an arc of a circle that has the same length as the circle's radius. The case of radian for the formula given earlier, a ''radian'' of ''n'' = 2{{pi}} units is obtained by setting ''k'' = {{sfrac|2{{pi}}|2{{pi}}}} = 1. One turn is 2{{pi}} radians, and one radian is {{sfrac|180|{{pi}}}} degrees, or about 57.2958 degrees. The radian is abbreviated ''rad'', though this symbol is often omitted in mathematical texts, where radians are assumed unless specified otherwise. When radians are used angles are considered as dimensionless. The radian is used in virtually all mathematical work beyond simple practical geometry, due, for example, to the pleasing and \"natural\" properties that the [[trigonometric function]]s display when their arguments are in radians. The radian is the (derived) unit of angular measurement in the [[SI]] system.\n\n;[[Clock position]] (''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;12): A clock position is the [[relative direction]] of an object described using the analogy of a [[12-hour clock]]. One imagines a clock face lying either upright or flat in front of oneself, and identifies the twelve hour markings with the directions in which they point.\n\n;[[Hour angle]] (''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;24): The astronomical ''hour angle'' is {{sfrac|24}} of a turn. As this system is amenable to measuring objects that cycle once per day (such as the relative position of stars), the sexagesimal subunits are called ''minute of time'' and ''second of time''.  These are distinct from, and 15 times larger than, minutes and seconds of arc. 1&nbsp;hour = 15\u00b0 = {{sfrac|{{pi}}|12}}&nbsp;rad = {{sfrac|6}}&nbsp;quad. = {{sfrac|24}} ''turn'' = {{sfrac|16|2|3}}&nbsp;grad.\n\n;[[Points of the compass|(Compass) point or wind]] (''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;32): The ''point'', used in [[navigation]], is {{sfrac|32}} of a turn. 1&nbsp;point = {{sfrac|8}} of a right angle = 11.25\u00b0 = 12.5&nbsp;grad. Each point is subdivided in four quarter-points so that 1 turn equals 128 quarter-points.\n\n;[[Hexacontade]] (''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;60): The ''hexacontade'' is a unit of 6\u00b0 that [[Eratosthenes]] used, so that a whole turn was divided into 60 units.\n\n;[[Pechus]] (''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;144\u2013180): The ''pechus'' was a [[Babylonian mathematics|Babylonian]] unit equal to about 2\u00b0 or {{sfrac|2|1|2}}\u00b0.\n\n;[[Binary degree]] (''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;256): The ''binary degree'', also known as the ''[[binary radian]]'' (or ''brad''), is {{sfrac|256}} of a turn.<ref name=\"ooPIC\"/> The binary degree is used in computing so that an angle can be efficiently represented in a single [[byte]] (albeit to limited precision). Other measures of angle used in computing may be based on dividing one whole turn into 2<sup>''n''</sup> equal parts for other values of ''n''.<ref name=\"Hargreaves_2010\"/>\n;[[Degree (angle)|Degree]] (''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;360): The ''degree'', denoted by a small superscript circle (\u00b0), is 1/360 of a turn, so one ''turn'' is 360\u00b0. The case of degrees for the formula given earlier, a ''degree'' of ''n'' = 360\u00b0 units is obtained by setting ''k'' = {{sfrac|360\u00b0|2{{pi}}}}. One advantage of this old [[sexagesimal]] subunit is that many angles common in simple geometry are measured as a whole number of degrees. Fractions of a degree may be written in normal decimal notation (e.g. 3.5\u00b0 for three and a half degrees), but the \"minute\" and \"second\" sexagesimal subunits of the \"degree-minute-second\" system are also in use, especially for [[Geographic coordinate system|geographical coordinates]] and in [[astronomy]] and [[ballistics]].\n\n;[[Diameter part]] (''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;376.99&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;): The ''diameter part'' (occasionally used in Islamic mathematics) is {{sfrac|60}} radian. One \"diameter part\" is approximately 0.95493\u00b0. There are about 376.991 diameter parts per turn.\n\n;[[Grad (angle)|Grad]] (''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;400): The ''grad'', also called ''grade'', ''gradian'', or ''gon'', is {{sfrac|400}} of a turn, so a right angle is 100 grads. It is a decimal subunit of the quadrant. A [[kilometre]] was historically defined as a [[centi]]-grad of arc along a great circle of the Earth, so the kilometer is the decimal analog to the [[sexagesimal]] nautical mile. The grad is used mostly in [[triangulation]].\n\n;[[Milliradian]]: The milliradian (mil or mrad) is defined as a thousandth of a radian, which means that a rotation of one [[Turn (geometry)|turn]] consists of 2000\u03c0 mil (or approximately 6283.185... mil), and almost all [[Telescopic sight|scope sights]] for [[firearm]]s are calibrated to this definition. In addition there are three other derived definitions used for artillery and navigation which are ''approximately'' equal to a milliradian. Under these three other definitions one turn makes up for exactly 6000, 6300 or 6400 mils, which equals spanning the range from 0.05625 to 0.06 degrees (3.375 to 3.6 minutes). In comparison, the true milliradian is approximately 0.05729578... degrees (3.43775... minutes). One \"[[NATO]] mil\" is defined as {{sfrac|6400}} of a circle. Just like with the true milliradian, each of the other definitions exploits the mil's handby property of subtensions, i.e. that the value of one milliradian approximately equals the angle subtended by a width of 1 meter as seen from 1&nbsp;km away ({{sfrac|2{{pi}}|6400}} = 0.0009817... \u2248 {{sfrac|1000}}).\n\n;[[Minute of arc]] (''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;21,600):  The ''minute of arc'' (or ''MOA'', ''arcminute'', or just ''minute'') is {{sfrac|60}} of a degree = {{sfrac|21,600}} turn. It is denoted by a single prime (&nbsp;\u2032&nbsp;). For example, 3\u00b0&nbsp;30\u2032 is equal to 3&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;60&nbsp;+&nbsp;30&nbsp;=&nbsp;210 minutes or 3&nbsp;+&nbsp;{{sfrac|30|60}} = 3.5 degrees. A mixed format with decimal fractions is also sometimes used, e.g. 3\u00b0&nbsp;5.72\u2032 = 3&nbsp;+&nbsp;{{sfrac|5.72|60}} degrees. A [[nautical mile]] was historically defined as a minute of arc along a [[great circle]] of the Earth.\n\n;[[Second of arc]] (''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1,296,000): The ''second of arc'' (or ''arcsecond'', or just ''second'') is {{sfrac|60}} of a minute of arc and {{sfrac|3600}} of a degree. It is denoted by a double prime (&nbsp;\u2033&nbsp;). For example, 3\u00b0&nbsp;7\u2032&nbsp;30\u2033 is equal to 3 + {{sfrac|7|60}} + {{sfrac|30|3600}} degrees, or 3.125&nbsp;degrees.\n\n;[[Milliarcsecond]] (''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1,296,000,000): mas\n;[[Microarcsecond]] (''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1,296,000,000,000): \u00b5as\n\n===Positive and negative angles===\nAlthough the definition of the measurement of an angle does not support the concept of a negative angle, it is frequently useful to impose a convention that allows positive and negative angular values to represent [[Orientation (geometry)|orientations]] and/or [[Rotation (mathematics)|rotations]] in opposite directions relative to some reference.\n\nIn a two-dimensional [[Cartesian coordinate system]], an angle is typically defined by its two sides, with its vertex at the origin. The ''initial side'' is on the positive [[x-axis]], while the other side or ''terminal side'' is defined by the measure from the initial side in radians, degrees, or turns. With ''positive angles'' representing rotations toward the positive [[y-axis]] and ''negative angles'' representing rotations toward the negative ''y''-axis.  When Cartesian coordinates are represented by ''standard position'', defined by the ''x''-axis rightward and the ''y''-axis upward, positive rotations are [[anticlockwise]] and negative rotations are [[clockwise]].\n\nIn many contexts, an angle of \u2212''\u03b8'' is effectively equivalent to an angle of \"one full turn minus ''\u03b8''\". For example, an orientation represented as &nbsp;\u221245\u00b0 is effectively equivalent to an orientation represented as 360\u00b0&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;45\u00b0 or 315\u00b0.  Although the final position is the same, a physical rotation (movement) of &nbsp;\u221245\u00b0 is not the same as a rotation of 315\u00b0 (for example, the rotation of a person holding a broom resting on a dusty floor would leave visually different traces of swept regions on the floor).\n\nIn three-dimensional geometry, \"clockwise\" and \"anticlockwise\" have no absolute meaning, so the direction of positive and negative angles must be defined relative to some reference, which is typically a [[Vector (geometric)|vector]] passing through the angle's vertex and perpendicular to the plane in which the rays of the angle lie.\n\nIn [[navigation]], [[bearing (navigation)|bearings]] or [[azimuth]] are measured relative to north.  By convention, viewed from above, bearing angles are positive clockwise, so a bearing of 45\u00b0 corresponds to a north-east orientation. Negative bearings are not used in navigation, so a north-west orientation corresponds to a bearing of 315\u00b0.\n\n===Alternative ways of measuring the size of an angle===\nThere are several alternatives to measuring the size of an angle by the angle of rotation.\nThe ''[[grade (slope)|grade of a slope]]'', or ''gradient'' is equal to the [[tangent (trigonometric function)|tangent]] of the angle, or sometimes (rarely) the [[sine]]. A gradient is often expressed as a percentage. For very small values (less than 5%), the grade of a slope is approximately the measure of the angle in radians.\n\nIn [[rational geometry]] the ''[[spread (rational trigonometry)|spread]]'' between two lines is defined as the square of the sine of the angle between the lines. As the sine of an angle and the sine of its supplementary angle are the same, any angle of rotation that maps one of the lines into the other leads to the same value for the spread between the lines.\n\n===Astronomical approximations===\nAstronomers measure angular separation of objects in degrees from their point of observation.\n* 0.5\u00b0 is approximately the width of the sun or moon.\n* 1\u00b0 is approximately the width of a little finger at arm's length.\n* 10\u00b0 is approximately the width of a closed fist at arm's length.\n* 20\u00b0 is approximately the width of a handspan at arm's length.\n\nThese measurements clearly depend on the individual subject, and the above should be treated as rough [[rule of thumb]] approximations only.\n\n==Angles between curves==\n[[File:Curve angles.svg|thumb|right|The angle between the two curves at ''P'' is defined as the angle between the tangents <var>A</var> and <var>B</var> at <var>P</var>.]]\nThe angle between a line and a [[curve]] (mixed angle) or between two intersecting curves (curvilinear angle) is defined to be the angle between the [[tangent]]s at the point of intersection. Various names (now rarely, if ever, used) have been given to particular cases:\u2014''amphicyrtic'' (Gr. {{lang|grc|\u1f00\u03bc\u03c6\u03af}}, on both sides, \u03ba\u03c5\u03c1\u03c4\u03cc\u03c2, convex) or ''cissoidal'' (Gr. \u03ba\u03b9\u03c3\u03c3\u03cc\u03c2, ivy), biconvex; ''xystroidal'' or ''sistroidal'' (Gr. \u03be\u03c5\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03af\u03c2, a tool for scraping), concavo-convex; ''amphicoelic'' (Gr. \u03ba\u03bf\u03af\u03bb\u03b7, a hollow) or ''angulus lunularis'', biconcave.<ref>{{harvnb|Chisholm|1911}}; {{harvnb|Heiberg|1908|p=178}}</ref><!-- Again, most of this paragraph is from EB1911 with Heath used as its source. -->\n\n==Bisecting and trisecting angles==\n{{Main article|Bisection#Angle bisector|Angle trisection}}\n\nThe [[Greek mathematics|ancient Greek mathematicians]] knew how to bisect an angle (divide it into two angles of equal measure) using only a [[compass and straightedge]], but could only trisect certain angles. In 1837 [[Pierre Wantzel]] showed that for most angles this construction cannot be performed.\n\n==Dot product and generalisations==\nIn the [[Euclidean space]], the angle ''\u03b8'' between two [[Euclidean vector]]s '''u''' and '''v''' is related to their [[dot product]] and their lengths by the formula\n\n:<math> \\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\mathbf{v} = \\cos(\\theta) \\left\\| \\mathbf{u} \\right\\| \\left\\| \\mathbf{v} \\right\\| .</math>\n\nThis formula supplies an easy method to find the angle between two planes (or curved surfaces) from their [[normal vector]]s and between [[skew lines]] from their vector equations.\n\n===Inner product===\nTo define angles in an abstract real [[inner product space]], we replace the Euclidean dot product ( '''\u00b7''' ) by the inner product <math> \\langle \\cdot , \\cdot \\rangle </math>, i.e.\n\n:<math> \\langle \\mathbf{u} , \\mathbf{v} \\rangle = \\cos(\\theta)\\ \\left\\| \\mathbf{u} \\right\\|\\ \\left\\| \\mathbf{v} \\right\\| .</math>\n\nIn a complex [[inner product space]], the expression for the cosine above may give non-real values, so it is replaced with\n\n:<math> \\operatorname{Re} \\left( \\langle \\mathbf{u} , \\mathbf{v} \\rangle \\right) = \\cos(\\theta)\\ \\left\\| \\mathbf{u} \\right\\| \\left\\| \\mathbf{v} \\right\\| .</math>\n\nor, more commonly, using the absolute value, with\n\n:<math> \\left| \\langle \\mathbf{u} , \\mathbf{v} \\rangle \\right| = | \\cos(\\theta) | \\ \\left\\| \\mathbf{u} \\right\\| \\ \\left\\| \\mathbf{v} \\right\\| .</math>\n\nThe latter definition ignores the direction of the vectors and thus describes the angle between one-dimensional subspaces <math>\\operatorname{span}(\\mathbf{u})</math> and <math>\\operatorname{span}(\\mathbf{v})</math> spanned by the vectors <math>\\mathbf{u}</math> and <math>\\mathbf{v}</math> correspondingly.\n\n===Angles between subspaces===\nThe definition of the angle between one-dimensional subspaces <math>\\operatorname{span}(\\mathbf{u})</math> and  <math>\\operatorname{span}(\\mathbf{v})</math> given by\n\n:<math> \\left| \\langle \\mathbf{u} , \\mathbf{v} \\rangle \\right| = |\\cos(\\theta)| \\left\\| \\mathbf{u} \\right\\| \\ \\left\\| \\mathbf{v} \\right\\| </math>\n\nin a [[Hilbert space]] can be extended to subspaces of any finite dimensions. Given two subspaces <math> \\mathcal{U} </math>, <math> \\mathcal{W} </math> with <math> \\dim ( \\mathcal{U}) := k \\leq \\dim ( \\mathcal{W}) := l </math>, this leads to a definition of <math>k</math> angles called canonical or [[principal angles]] between subspaces.\n\n===Angles in Riemannian geometry===\nIn [[Riemannian geometry]], the [[metric tensor]] is used to define the angle between two [[tangent]]s. Where ''U'' and ''V'' are tangent vectors and ''g''<sub>''ij''</sub> are the components of the metric tensor ''G'',\n\n:<math>\n\\cos \\theta = \\frac{g_{ij}U^iV^j}{\\sqrt{ \\left| g_{ij}U^iU^j \\right| \\left| g_{ij}V^iV^j \\right|}}.\n</math>\n\n===Hyperbolic angle===\nA [[hyperbolic angle]] is an [[argument of a function|argument]] of a [[hyperbolic function]] just as the ''circular angle'' is the argument of a [[circular function]]. The comparison can be visualized as the size of the openings of a [[hyperbolic sector]] and a [[circular sector]] since the [[area]]s of these sectors correspond to the angle magnitudes in each case. Unlike the circular angle, the hyperbolic angle is unbounded. When the circular and hyperbolic functions are viewed as [[infinite series]] in their angle argument, the circular ones are just [[alternating series]] forms of the hyperbolic functions. This weaving of the two types of angle and function was explained by [[Leonhard Euler]] in ''[[Introduction to the Analysis of the Infinite]]''.\n\n==Angles in geography and astronomy==\nIn [[geography]], the location of any point on the Earth can be identified using a ''[[geographic coordinate system]]''. This system specifies the [[latitude]] and [[longitude]] of any location in terms of angles subtended at the centre of the Earth, using the [[equator]] and (usually) the [[Greenwich meridian]] as references.\n\nIn [[astronomy]], a given point on the [[celestial sphere]] (that is, the apparent position of an astronomical object) can be identified using any of several ''[[astronomical coordinate systems]]'', where the references vary according to the particular system. Astronomers measure the ''[[angular separation]]'' of two [[star]]s by imagining two lines through the centre of the [[Earth]], each intersecting one of the stars. The angle between those lines can be measured, and is the angular separation between the two stars.\n\nIn both geography and astronomy, a sighting direction can be specified in terms of a [[vertical angle]] such as [[altitude angle|altitude]] /[[elevation angle|elevation]] with respect to the [[horizon]] as well as the [[azimuth]] with respect to [[north]].\n\nAstronomers also measure the ''apparent size'' of objects as an [[angular diameter]]. For example, the [[full moon]] has an angular diameter of approximately 0.5\u00b0, when viewed from Earth. One could say, \"The Moon's diameter subtends an angle of half a degree.\" The [[small-angle formula]] can be used to convert such an angular measurement into a distance/size ratio.\n\n==See also==\n{{div col |colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Bisection#Angle bisector|Angle bisector]]\n* [[Angular velocity]]\n* [[Argument (complex analysis)]]\n* [[Astrological aspect]]\n* [[Central angle]]\n* [[Clock angle problem]]\n* [[Dihedral angle]]\n* [[Exterior angle theorem]]\n* [[Great circle distance]]\n* [[Inscribed angle]]\n* [[Irrational angle]]\n* [[Phase (waves)]]\n* [[Protractor]]\n* [[Solid angle]] for a concept of angle in three dimensions.\n* [[Spherical angle]]\n* [[Transcendent angle]]\n* [[Trisection]]\n* [[Zenith angle]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=\"nb\"}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"Jeans_1947\">{{cite book |author-first=James Hopwood |author-last=Jeans |author-link=James Hopwood Jeans |date=1947 |title=The Growth of Physical Science |publisher=CUP Archive |page=[https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.210060/page/n25 7] |url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.210060}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Murnaghan_1946\">{{cite book |author-first=Francis Dominic |author-last=Murnaghan |author-link=Francis Dominic Murnaghan (mathematician) |date=1946 |title=Analytic Geometry |page=2}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Dimitric_2012\">{{cite journal |title=On Angles and Angle Measurements |author-first=Radoslav M. |author-last=Dimitri\u0107 |journal=The Teaching of Mathematics |date=2012 |volume=XV |number=2 |pages=133\u2013140 |url=http://elib.mi.sanu.ac.rs/files/journals/tm/29/tm1525.pdf |access-date=2019-08-06 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190117195213/http://elib.mi.sanu.ac.rs/files/journals/tm/29/tm1525.pdf |archive-date=2019-01-17}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"ooPIC\">{{cite web |title=ooPIC Programmer's Guide - Chapter 15: URCP |work=[[ooPIC]] Manual & Technical Specifications - ooPIC Compiler Ver 6.0 |orig-year=1997 |date=2007 |publisher=Savage Innovations, LLC |url=http://www.oopic.com/pgchap15.htm |access-date=2019-08-05 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080628051746/http://www.oopic.com/pgchap15.htm |archive-date=2008-06-28}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Hargreaves_2010\">{{cite web |title=Angles, integers, and modulo arithmetic |author-first=Shawn |author-last=Hargreaves |author-link=:pl:Shawn Hargreaves |publisher=blogs.msdn.com |url=http://blogs.msdn.com/shawnhar/archive/2010/01/04/angles-integers-and-modulo-arithmetic.aspx |access-date=2019-08-05 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190630223817/http://www.shawnhargreaves.com/blogindex.html |archive-date=2019-06-03}}</ref>\n}}\n* {{citation |last1=Henderson |first1=David W. |last2=Taimina |first2=Daina |year=2005 |title=Experiencing Geometry / Euclidean and Non-Euclidean with History |edition=3rd |publisher=Pearson Prentice Hall |isbn=978-0-13-143748-7|page=104}}\n* {{citation |last=Heiberg |first=Johan Ludvig |year=1908 |title=Euclid |editor-first=T.

Angles formed by the intersection of two curves in a plane are defined as the angle determined by the tangent rays at the point of intersection. Similar statements hold in space, for example, the [[spherical angle]] formed by two [[great circle]]s on a [[sphere]] is the dihedral angle between the planes determined by the great circles.\n\n''Angle'' is also used to designate the [[measure (mathematics)|measure]] of an angle or of a [[Rotation (mathematics)|rotation]]. This measure is the ratio of the length of a [[arc (geometry)|circular arc]] to its [[radius]]. In the case of a geometric angle, the arc is centered at the vertex and delimited by the sides. In the case of a rotation, the arc is centered at the center of the rotation and delimited by any other point and its image by the rotation.\n\nThe word ''angle'' comes from the [[Latin]] word ''angulus'', meaning \"corner\"; [[cognate]] words are the [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|\u1f00\u03b3\u03ba\u03cd\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2}} ''(ankyl\u03bfs)'', meaning \"crooked, curved,\" and the [[English language|English]] word \"[[ankle]]\". Both are connected with the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] root ''*ank-'', meaning \"to bend\" or \"bow\".<ref>{{harvnb|Slocum|2007}}</ref>\n<!--Note: \u1f00\u03b3\u03ba\u03cd\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 rather than \u1f00\u03bd\u03ba\u03cd\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 is correct, the \u03b3\u03ba is a digraph pronounced [\u014bk].-->\n\n[[Euclid]] defines a plane angle as the inclination to each other, in a plane, of two lines which meet each other, and do not lie straight with respect to each other. According to [[Proclus]] an angle must be either a quality or a quantity, or a relationship. The first concept was used by [[Eudemus of Rhodes|Eudemus]], who regarded an angle as a deviation from a [[straight line]]; the second by [[Carpus of Antioch]], who regarded it as the interval or space between the intersecting lines; Euclid adopted the third concept, although his definitions of right, acute, and obtuse angles are certainly quantitative.<ref>{{harvnb|Chisholm|1911}}; {{harvnb|Heiberg|1908|pp=177\u2013178}}</ref><!-- This paragraph is quoted from EB1911, but its source seems to be Heath.-->\n\n==Identifying angles==\nIn mathematical expressions, it is common to use [[Greek letter]]s (<var>\u03b1</var>, <var>\u03b2</var>, <var>\u03b3</var>, <var>\u03b8</var>, <var>\u03c6</var>,&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;) to serve as [[Variable (mathematics)|variables]] standing for the size of some angle. (To avoid confusion with its other meaning, the symbol [[Pi|{{math|\u03c0}}]] is typically not used for this purpose.) Lower case Roman letters (''a'',&nbsp;''b'',&nbsp;''c'',&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;) are also used, as are upper case Roman letters in the context of [[polygon]]s. See the figures in this article for examples.\n\nIn geometric figures, angles may also be identified by the labels attached to the three points that define them. For example, the angle at vertex A enclosed by the rays AB and AC (i.e. the lines from point A to point B and point A to point C) is denoted \u2220BAC (in Unicode {{unichar|2220|ANGLE|HTML=}}) or <math>\\widehat{\\rm BAC}</math>. Sometimes, where there is no risk of confusion, the angle may be referred to simply by its vertex (\"angle A\").\n\nPotentially, an angle denoted, say, \u2220BAC might refer to any of four angles: the clockwise angle from B to C, the anticlockwise angle from B to C, the clockwise angle from C to B, or the anticlockwise angle from C to B, where the direction in which the angle is measured determines its sign (see [[#Positive and negative angles|Positive and negative angles]]). However, in many geometrical situations it is obvious from context that the positive angle less than or equal to 180 degrees is meant, and no ambiguity arises. Otherwise, a convention may be adopted so that \u2220BAC always refers to the anticlockwise (positive) angle from B to C, and \u2220CAB to the anticlockwise (positive) angle from C to B.\n\n==Types of angles==\n{{Redirect|Oblique angle|the cinematographic technique|Dutch angle}}\n===Individual angles===\nThere is some common terminology for angles, whose measure is always non-negative (see [[#Positive and negative angles]]):\n* An angle equal to 0\u00b0 or not turned is called a zero angle.\n* Angles smaller than a right angle (less than 90\u00b0) are called ''acute angles'' (\"acute\" meaning \"sharp\").\n* An angle equal to {{sfrac|4}} turn (90\u00b0 or {{sfrac|{{math|\u03c0}}|2}} radians) is called a ''[[right angle]]''. Two lines that form a right angle are said to be ''[[normal (geometry)|normal]]'', ''[[orthogonality|orthogonal]]'', or ''[[perpendicular]]''.\n* Angles larger than a right angle and smaller than a straight angle (between 90\u00b0 and 180\u00b0) are called ''obtuse angles'' (\"obtuse\" meaning \"blunt\").\n* An angle equal to {{sfrac|2}} turn (180\u00b0 or {{math|\u03c0}} radians) is called a ''straight angle''.\n* Angles larger than a straight angle but less than 1 turn (between 180\u00b0 and 360\u00b0) are called ''reflex angles''.\n* An angle equal to 1 turn (360\u00b0 or 2{{math|\u03c0}} radians) is called a ''full angle'', ''complete angle'', ''round angle'' or a ''perigon''.\n* Angles that are not right angles or a multiple of a right angle are called ''oblique angles''.\n\nThe names, intervals, and measured units are shown in a table below:\n\n{{Multiple image\n|align=right\n|direction=horizontal\n|image1=Right angle.svg\n|width1=140\n|caption1=[[Right angle]]\n\n|image2=Angle obtuse acute straight.svg\n|width2=250\n|caption2=Acute (<var>a</var>), obtuse (<var>b</var>), and straight (<var>c</var>) angles.

An angle is defined by its measure and is not dependent upon the lengths of the sides of the angle (e.g. all ''right angles'' are equal in measure).\n* Two angles which share terminal sides, but differ in size by an integer multiple of a turn, are called ''coterminal angles''.\n* A ''reference angle'' is the acute version of any angle determined by repeatedly subtracting or adding straight angle ({{sfrac|2}} turn, 180\u00b0, or {{math|\u03c0}} radians), to the results as necessary, until the magnitude of result is an acute angle, a value between 0 and {{sfrac|4}} turn, 90\u00b0, or {{sfrac|{{math|\u03c0}}|2}} radians. For example, an angle of 30 degrees has a reference angle of 30 degrees, and an angle of 150 degrees also has a reference angle of 30 degrees (180\u2013150). An angle of 750 degrees has a reference angle of 30 degrees (750\u2013720).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mathwords.com/r/reference_angle.htm|title=Mathwords: Reference Angle|website=www.mathwords.com|accessdate=26 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171023035017/http://www.mathwords.com/r/reference_angle.htm|archivedate=23 October 2017}}</ref>\n\n==={{anchor|adjacent}} Vertical and adjacent angle pairs===\n[[File:Vertical Angles.svg|thumb|150px|left|Angles A and B are a pair of vertical angles; angles C and D are a pair of vertical angles.]]\n\nWhen two straight lines intersect at a point, four angles are formed. Pairwise these angles are named according to their location relative to each other.\n* A pair of angles opposite each other, formed by two intersecting straight lines that form an \"X\"-like shape, are called ''vertical angles'' or ''opposite angles'' or ''vertically opposite angles''. They are abbreviated as ''vert. opp. \u2220s''.<ref name=\"tb\">{{harvnb|Wong|Wong|2009|pp=161\u2013163}}</ref>\n:The equality of vertically opposite angles is called the ''vertical angle theorem''. [[Eudemus of Rhodes]] attributed the proof to [[Thales|Thales of Miletus]].<ref>{{cite book|author=[[Euclid]]|title=The Elements||orig-year=300 BC|title-link=Euclid's Elements}} Proposition I:13.</ref>{{sfn|Shute| Shirk|Porter|1960|pp=25\u201327}} The proposition showed that since both of a pair of vertical angles are supplementary to both of the adjacent angles, the vertical angles are equal in measure. According to a historical note,{{sfn|Shute| Shirk|Porter|1960|pp=25\u201327}} when Thales visited Egypt, he observed that whenever the Egyptians drew two intersecting lines, they would measure the vertical angles to make sure that they were equal. Thales concluded that one could prove that all vertical angles are equal if one accepted some general notions such as: all straight angles are equal, equals added to equals are equal, and equals subtracted from equals are equal.\n\n:In the figure, assume the measure of Angle ''A'' = ''x''. When two adjacent angles form a straight line, they are supplementary. Therefore, the measure of Angle ''C'' = 180 \u2212 ''x''. Similarly, the measure of Angle ''D'' = 180 \u2212 ''x''. Both Angle ''C'' and Angle ''D'' have measures equal to 180 \u2212 ''x'' and are congruent. Since Angle ''B'' is supplementary to both Angles ''C'' and ''D'', either of these angle measures may be used to determine the measure of Angle ''B''. Using the measure of either Angle ''C'' or Angle ''D'' we find the measure of Angle ''B'' = 180 \u2212 (180 \u2212 ''x'') = 180 \u2212 180 + ''x'' = ''x''. Therefore, both Angle ''A'' and Angle ''B'' have measures equal to ''x'' and are equal in measure.\n\n[[File:Adjacentangles.svg|right|thumb|225px|Angles ''A'' and ''B'' are adjacent.]]\n* ''Adjacent angles'', often abbreviated as ''adj. \u2220s'', are angles that share a common vertex and edge but do not share any interior points. In other words, they are angles that are side by side, or adjacent, sharing an \"arm\". Adjacent angles which sum to a right angle, straight angle or full angle are special and are respectively called ''complementary'', ''supplementary'' and ''explementary'' angles (see \"Combine angle pairs\" below).\n\nA [[Transversal (geometry)|transversal]] is a line that intersects a pair of (often parallel) lines and is associated with ''alternate interior angles'', ''corresponding angles'', ''interior angles'', and ''exterior angles''.{{sfn|Jacobs|1974|p=255}}\n\n===Combining angle pairs===\nThere are three special angle pairs which involve the summation of angles:\n{{anchor|complementary angle}}\n[[File:Complement angle.svg|thumb|150px|The ''complementary'' angles <var>a</var> and <var>b</var> (<var>b</var> is the ''complement'' of <var>a</var>, and <var>a</var> is the complement of <var>b</var>).]]\n* ''Complementary angles'' are angle pairs whose measures sum to one right angle ({{sfrac|4}} turn, 90\u00b0, or {{sfrac|{{math|\u03c0}}|2}} radians). If the two complementary angles are adjacent their non-shared sides form a right angle. In Euclidean geometry, the two acute angles in a right triangle are complementary, because the sum of internal angles of a [[triangle]] is 180 degrees, and the right angle itself accounts for ninety degrees.\n:The adjective complementary is from Latin ''complementum'', associated with the verb ''complere'', \"to fill up\". An acute angle is \"filled up\" by its complement to form a right angle.\n:The difference between an angle and a right angle is termed the ''complement'' of the angle.<ref name=\"Chisholm 1911\">{{harvnb|Chisholm|1911}}</ref>\n:If angles ''A'' and ''B'' are complementary, the following relationships hold:\n:: <math>\n\\begin{align}\n& \\sin^2A + \\sin^2B = 1 & & \\cos^2A + \\cos^2B = 1 \\\\[3pt]\n& \\tan A = \\cot B  & & \\sec A = \\csc B\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n:(The [[tangent]] of an angle equals the [[cotangent]] of its complement and its secant equals the [[cosecant]] of its complement.)\n:The [[prefix]] \"[[co (function prefix)|co-]]\" in the names of some trigonometric ratios refers to the word \"complementary\".\n{{clear|right}}\n[[File:Angle obtuse acute straight.svg|thumb|right|300px|The angles <var>a</var> and <var>b</var> are ''supplementary'' angles.]]\n* {{anchor|Linear pair of angles|Supplementary angle}}Two angles that sum to a straight angle ({{sfrac|2}} turn, 180\u00b0, or {{math|\u03c0}} radians) are called ''supplementary angles''.\n:If the two supplementary angles are [[#adjacent|adjacent]] (i.e. have a common [[vertex (geometry)|vertex]] and share just one side), their non-shared sides form a [[line (geometry)|straight line]]. Such angles are called a ''linear pair of angles''.{{sfn|Jacobs|1974|p=97}} However, supplementary angles do not have to be on the same line, and can be separated in space.  For example, adjacent angles of a [[parallelogram]] are supplementary, and opposite angles of a [[cyclic quadrilateral]] (one whose vertices all fall on a single circle) are supplementary.\n:If a point P is exterior to a circle with center O, and if the [[tangent lines to circles|tangent lines]] from P touch the circle at points T and Q, then \u2220TPQ and \u2220TOQ are supplementary.\n:The sines of supplementary angles are equal. Their cosines and tangents (unless undefined) are equal in magnitude but have opposite signs.\n:In Euclidean geometry, any sum of two angles in a triangle is supplementary to the third, because the sum of internal angles of a triangle is a straight angle.\n{{clear|right}}\n{{anchor|explementary angle}}\n[[File:Reflex angle.svg|thumb|right|150px|Sum of two ''explementary'' angles is a ''complete'' angle.]]\n* Two angles that sum to a complete angle (1 turn, 360\u00b0, or 2{{math|\u03c0}} radians) are called ''explementary angles'' or ''conjugate angles''.\n*: The difference between an angle and a complete angle is termed the ''explement'' of the angle or ''conjugate'' of an angle.\n{{clear|right}}\n\n===Polygon-related angles===\n[[File:ExternalAngles.svg|thumb|300px|right|Internal and external angles.]]\n* An angle that is part of a [[simple polygon]] is called an ''[[interior angle]]'' if it lies on the inside of that simple polygon. A simple [[concave polygon]] has at least one interior angle that is a reflex angle.\n*: In [[Euclidean geometry]], the measures of the interior angles of a [[triangle]] add up to {{math|\u03c0}} radians, 180\u00b0, or {{sfrac|2}} turn; the measures of the interior angles of a simple [[convex polygon|convex]] [[quadrilateral]] add up to 2{{math|\u03c0}} radians, 360\u00b0, or 1 turn. In general, the measures of the interior angles of a simple convex [[polygon]] with ''n'' sides add up to (''n''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;2){{math|\u03c0}} radians, or 180(''n''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;2) degrees, (2''n''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;4) right angles, or ({{sfrac|''n''|2}}&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1) turn.\n* The supplement of an interior angle is called an ''[[exterior angle]]'', that is, an interior angle and an exterior angle form a [[#Linear pair of angles|linear pair of angles]]. There are two exterior angles at each vertex of the polygon, each determined by extending one of the two sides of the polygon that meet at the vertex; these two angles are vertical angles and hence are equal. An exterior angle measures the amount of rotation one has to make at a vertex to trace out the polygon.{{sfn|Henderson|Taimina|2005|p=104}} If the corresponding interior angle is a reflex angle, the exterior angle should be considered [[Negative number|negative]]. Even in a non-simple polygon it may be possible to define the exterior angle, but one will have to pick an [[orientation (mathematics)|orientation]] of the [[plane (mathematics)|plane]] (or [[surface (mathematics)|surface]]) to decide the sign of the exterior angle measure.\n*: In Euclidean geometry, the sum of the exterior angles of a simple convex polygon will be one full turn (360\u00b0). The exterior angle here could be called a ''supplementary exterior angle''. Exterior angles are commonly used in [[Logo (programming language)|Logo Turtle programs]] when drawing regular polygons.\n* In a [[triangle]], the [[bisection|bisectors]] of two exterior angles and the bisector of the other interior angle are [[concurrent lines|concurrent]] (meet at a single point).<ref name=Johnson>Johnson, Roger A.

Angles that have the same size are said to be ''equal'' or ''congruent'' or ''equal in measure''.\n\nIn some contexts, such as identifying a point on a circle or describing the ''orientation'' of an object in two dimensions relative to a reference orientation, angles that differ by an exact multiple of a full [[Turn (geometry)|turn]] are effectively equivalent.  In other contexts, such as identifying a point on a [[spiral]] curve or describing the ''cumulative rotation'' of an object in two dimensions relative to a reference orientation, angles that differ by a non-zero multiple of a full turn are not equivalent.\n\n[[File:Angle measure.svg|right|thumb|The measure of angle <var>\u03b8</var> (in radians) is the quotient of <var>s</var> and <var>r</var>.]]\n\nIn order to measure an angle <var>[[theta|\u03b8]]</var>, a [[circular arc]] centered at the vertex of the angle is drawn, e.g. with a pair of [[Compasses (drafting)|compasses]]. The ratio of the length <var>s</var> of the arc by the radius <var>r</var> of the circle is the measure of the angle in [[radian]]s.\n\nThe measure of the angle in another angular unit is then obtained by multiplying its measure in radians by the scaling factor {{sfrac|''k''|2{{pi}}}}, where ''k'' is the measure of a complete turn in the chosen unit (for example 360 for [[degree (angle)|degrees]] or 400 for [[gradian]]s):\n\n:<math> \\theta = k \\frac{s}{2\\pi r}. </math>\n\nThe value of <var>\u03b8</var> thus defined is independent of the size of the circle: if the length of the radius is changed then the arc length changes in the same proportion, so the ratio ''s''/''r'' is unaltered. (Proof. The formula above can be rewritten as {{nowrap|1 = ''k'' = {{sfrac|''\u03b8r''|''s''}}.}} One turn, for which {{nowrap|1 = ''\u03b8'' = ''n''}} units, corresponds to an arc equal in length to the circle's [[circumference]], which is 2{{math|\u03c0}}''r'', so {{nowrap|1 = ''s'' = 2{{math|\u03c0}}''r''}}. Substituting ''n'' for ''\u03b8'' and 2{{math|\u03c0}}''r'' for ''s'' in the formula, results in {{nowrap|1 = ''k'' = {{sfrac|''nr''|2{{math|\u03c0}}''r''}} = {{sfrac|''n''|2{{math|\u03c0}}}}.}}) {{refn|group=\"nb\"|This approach requires however an additional proof that the measure of the angle does not change with changing radius <var>r</var>, in addition to the issue of \"measurement units chosen.\" A smoother approach is to measure the angle by the length of the corresponding unit circle arc. Here \"unit\" can be chosen to be dimensionless in the sense that it is the real number 1 associated with the unit segment on the real line. See Radoslav M. Dimitri\u0107 for instance.<ref name=\"Dimitric_2012\"/>}}\n\n===Angle addition postulate===\nThe angle addition postulate states that if ''B'' is in the interior of angle ''AOC'', then\n\n:<math> m\\angle AOC = m\\angle AOB + m\\angle BOC </math>\n\nThe measure of the angle ''AOC'' is the sum of the measure of angle AOB and the measure of angle ''BOC''. In this postulate it does not matter in which [[Units of measurement|unit]] the angle is measured as long as each angle is measured in the same unit.\n\n===Units===\n{{see also|Angular unit}}\n<!-- the less remarkable units may be removed from this section, add them to angular unit (if they are not there yet) -->\n\nUnits used to represent angles are listed below in descending magnitude order. Of these units, the ''[[degree (angle)|degree]]'' and the ''[[radian]]'' are by far the most commonly used.  Angles expressed in radians are dimensionless for the purposes of [[dimensional analysis]].\n\nMost units of angular measurement are defined such that one ''[[Turn (geometry)|turn]]''  (i.e. one full circle) is equal to ''n'' units, for some whole number ''n''.  The two exceptions are the radian and the diameter part.\n\n;[[turn (geometry)|Turn]] (''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1): The ''turn'', also ''cycle'', ''full circle'', ''revolution'', and ''rotation'', is complete circular movement or measure (as to return to the same point) with circle or ellipse.  A turn is abbreviated {{mvar|\u03c4}}, ''cyc'', ''rev'', or ''rot'' depending on the application, but in the acronym ''[[Revolutions per minute|rpm]]'' (revolutions per minute), just ''r'' is used. A ''turn'' of ''n'' units is obtained by setting {{nowrap|1 = ''k'' = {{sfrac|2{{pi}}}}}} in the formula above. The equivalence of 1 ''turn'' is 360\u00b0, 2{{pi}} rad, 400 grad, and 4 right angles. The symbol {{mvar|\u03c4}} can also be used as a [[mathematical constant]] to represent 2{{pi}} radians. Used in this way ({{math|1= ''k'' = {{sfrac|\u03c4|2\u03c0}}}}) allows for radians to be expressed as a fraction of a turn. For example, half a turn is {{math|1 ={{sfrac|\u03c4|2}} = \u03c0}}.\n\n;[[Quadrant (circle)|Quadrant]] (''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;4): The ''quadrant'' is {{sfrac|4}} of a turn, i.e. a ''[[right angle]]''. It is the unit used in [[Euclid's Elements]]. 1 quad. = 90\u00b0 = {{sfrac|{{pi}}|2}}&nbsp;rad = {{sfrac|4}} turn = 100&nbsp;grad. In German the symbol <sup>\u221f</sup> has been used to denote a quadrant.\n\n;[[Sextant (circle)|Sextant]] (''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;6): The ''sextant'' (''angle of the [[equilateral triangle]]'') is {{sfrac|6}} of a turn. It was the unit used by the [[Babylonians]],<ref name=\"Jeans_1947\"/><ref name=\"Murnaghan_1946\"/> and is especially easy to construct with ruler and compasses. The degree, minute of arc and second of arc are [[sexagesimal]] subunits of the Babylonian unit. 1 Babylonian unit = 60\u00b0 = {{pi}}/3&nbsp;rad \u2248 1.047197551&nbsp;rad.\n[[File:Angle radian.svg|right|thumb|<var>\u03b8</var> = <var>s</var>/<var>r</var> rad = 1 rad.]]\n\n;[[Radian]] (''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp; 2{{pi}}&nbsp;=&nbsp; 6.283&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;): The ''[[radian]]'' is the angle subtended by an arc of a circle that has the same length as the circle's radius. The case of radian for the formula given earlier, a ''radian'' of ''n'' = 2{{pi}} units is obtained by setting ''k'' = {{sfrac|2{{pi}}|2{{pi}}}} = 1. One turn is 2{{pi}} radians, and one radian is {{sfrac|180|{{pi}}}} degrees, or about 57.2958 degrees. The radian is abbreviated ''rad'', though this symbol is often omitted in mathematical texts, where radians are assumed unless specified otherwise. When radians are used angles are considered as dimensionless. The radian is used in virtually all mathematical work beyond simple practical geometry, due, for example, to the pleasing and \"natural\" properties that the [[trigonometric function]]s display when their arguments are in radians. The radian is the (derived) unit of angular measurement in the [[SI]] system.\n\n;[[Clock position]] (''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;12): A clock position is the [[relative direction]] of an object described using the analogy of a [[12-hour clock]]. One imagines a clock face lying either upright or flat in front of oneself, and identifies the twelve hour markings with the directions in which they point.\n\n;[[Hour angle]] (''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;24): The astronomical ''hour angle'' is {{sfrac|24}} of a turn. As this system is amenable to measuring objects that cycle once per day (such as the relative position of stars), the sexagesimal subunits are called ''minute of time'' and ''second of time''.  These are distinct from, and 15 times larger than, minutes and seconds of arc. 1&nbsp;hour = 15\u00b0 = {{sfrac|{{pi}}|12}}&nbsp;rad = {{sfrac|6}}&nbsp;quad. = {{sfrac|24}} ''turn'' = {{sfrac|16|2|3}}&nbsp;grad.\n\n;[[Points of the compass|(Compass) point or wind]] (''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;32): The ''point'', used in [[navigation]], is {{sfrac|32}} of a turn. 1&nbsp;point = {{sfrac|8}} of a right angle = 11.25\u00b0 = 12.5&nbsp;grad. Each point is subdivided in four quarter-points so that 1 turn equals 128 quarter-points.\n\n;[[Hexacontade]] (''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;60): The ''hexacontade'' is a unit of 6\u00b0 that [[Eratosthenes]] used, so that a whole turn was divided into 60 units.\n\n;[[Pechus]] (''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;144\u2013180): The ''pechus'' was a [[Babylonian mathematics|Babylonian]] unit equal to about 2\u00b0 or {{sfrac|2|1|2}}\u00b0.\n\n;[[Binary degree]] (''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;256): The ''binary degree'', also known as the ''[[binary radian]]'' (or ''brad''), is {{sfrac|256}} of a turn.<ref name=\"ooPIC\"/> The binary degree is used in computing so that an angle can be efficiently represented in a single [[byte]] (albeit to limited precision). Other measures of angle used in computing may be based on dividing one whole turn into 2<sup>''n''</sup> equal parts for other values of ''n''.<ref name=\"Hargreaves_2010\"/>\n;[[Degree (angle)|Degree]] (''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;360): The ''degree'', denoted by a small superscript circle (\u00b0), is 1/360 of a turn, so one ''turn'' is 360\u00b0. The case of degrees for the formula given earlier, a ''degree'' of ''n'' = 360\u00b0 units is obtained by setting ''k'' = {{sfrac|360\u00b0|2{{pi}}}}. One advantage of this old [[sexagesimal]] subunit is that many angles common in simple geometry are measured as a whole number of degrees. Fractions of a degree may be written in normal decimal notation (e.g. 3.5\u00b0 for three and a half degrees), but the \"minute\" and \"second\" sexagesimal subunits of the \"degree-minute-second\" system are also in use, especially for [[Geographic coordinate system|geographical coordinates]] and in [[astronomy]] and [[ballistics]].\n\n;[[Diameter part]] (''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;376.99&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;): The ''diameter part'' (occasionally used in Islamic mathematics) is {{sfrac|60}} radian. One \"diameter part\" is approximately 0.95493\u00b0. There are about 376.991 diameter parts per turn.\n\n;[[Grad (angle)|Grad]] (''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;400): The ''grad'', also called ''grade'', ''gradian'', or ''gon'', is {{sfrac|400}} of a turn, so a right angle is 100 grads. It is a decimal subunit of the quadrant. A [[kilometre]] was historically defined as a [[centi]]-grad of arc along a great circle of the Earth, so the kilometer is the decimal analog to the [[sexagesimal]] nautical mile. The grad is used mostly in [[triangulation]].\n\n;[[Milliradian]]: The milliradian (mil or mrad) is defined as a thousandth of a radian, which means that a rotation of one [[Turn (geometry)|turn]] consists of 2000\u03c0 mil (or approximately 6283.185... mil), and almost all [[Telescopic sight|scope sights]] for [[firearm]]s are calibrated to this definition. In addition there are three other derived definitions used for artillery and navigation which are ''approximately'' equal to a milliradian. Under these three other definitions one turn makes up for exactly 6000, 6300 or 6400 mils, which equals spanning the range from 0.05625 to 0.06 degrees (3.375 to 3.6 minutes). In comparison, the true milliradian is approximately 0.05729578... degrees (3.43775... minutes). One \"[[NATO]] mil\" is defined as {{sfrac|6400}} of a circle. Just like with the true milliradian, each of the other definitions exploits the mil's handby property of subtensions, i.e. that the value of one milliradian approximately equals the angle subtended by a width of 1 meter as seen from 1&nbsp;km away ({{sfrac|2{{pi}}|6400}} = 0.0009817... \u2248 {{sfrac|1000}}).\n\n;[[Minute of arc]] (''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;21,600):  The ''minute of arc'' (or ''MOA'', ''arcminute'', or just ''minute'') is {{sfrac|60}} of a degree = {{sfrac|21,600}} turn. It is denoted by a single prime (&nbsp;\u2032&nbsp;). For example, 3\u00b0&nbsp;30\u2032 is equal to 3&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;60&nbsp;+&nbsp;30&nbsp;=&nbsp;210 minutes or 3&nbsp;+&nbsp;{{sfrac|30|60}} = 3.5 degrees. A mixed format with decimal fractions is also sometimes used, e.g. 3\u00b0&nbsp;5.72\u2032 = 3&nbsp;+&nbsp;{{sfrac|5.72|60}} degrees. A [[nautical mile]] was historically defined as a minute of arc along a [[great circle]] of the Earth.\n\n;[[Second of arc]] (''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1,296,000): The ''second of arc'' (or ''arcsecond'', or just ''second'') is {{sfrac|60}} of a minute of arc and {{sfrac|3600}} of a degree. It is denoted by a double prime (&nbsp;\u2033&nbsp;). For example, 3\u00b0&nbsp;7\u2032&nbsp;30\u2033 is equal to 3 + {{sfrac|7|60}} + {{sfrac|30|3600}} degrees, or 3.125&nbsp;degrees.\n\n;[[Milliarcsecond]] (''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1,296,000,000): mas\n;[[Microarcsecond]] (''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1,296,000,000,000): \u00b5as\n\n===Positive and negative angles===\nAlthough the definition of the measurement of an angle does not support the concept of a negative angle, it is frequently useful to impose a convention that allows positive and negative angular values to represent [[Orientation (geometry)|orientations]] and/or [[Rotation (mathematics)|rotations]] in opposite directions relative to some reference.\n\nIn a two-dimensional [[Cartesian coordinate system]], an angle is typically defined by its two sides, with its vertex at the origin. The ''initial side'' is on the positive [[x-axis]], while the other side or ''terminal side'' is defined by the measure from the initial side in radians, degrees, or turns. With ''positive angles'' representing rotations toward the positive [[y-axis]] and ''negative angles'' representing rotations toward the negative ''y''-axis.  When Cartesian coordinates are represented by ''standard position'', defined by the ''x''-axis rightward and the ''y''-axis upward, positive rotations are [[anticlockwise]] and negative rotations are [[clockwise]].\n\nIn many contexts, an angle of \u2212''\u03b8'' is effectively equivalent to an angle of \"one full turn minus ''\u03b8''\". For example, an orientation represented as &nbsp;\u221245\u00b0 is effectively equivalent to an orientation represented as 360\u00b0&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;45\u00b0 or 315\u00b0.  Although the final position is the same, a physical rotation (movement) of &nbsp;\u221245\u00b0 is not the same as a rotation of 315\u00b0 (for example, the rotation of a person holding a broom resting on a dusty floor would leave visually different traces of swept regions on the floor).\n\nIn three-dimensional geometry, \"clockwise\" and \"anticlockwise\" have no absolute meaning, so the direction of positive and negative angles must be defined relative to some reference, which is typically a [[Vector (geometric)|vector]] passing through the angle's vertex and perpendicular to the plane in which the rays of the angle lie.\n\nIn [[navigation]], [[bearing (navigation)|bearings]] or [[azimuth]] are measured relative to north.  By convention, viewed from above, bearing angles are positive clockwise, so a bearing of 45\u00b0 corresponds to a north-east orientation. Negative bearings are not used in navigation, so a north-west orientation corresponds to a bearing of 315\u00b0.\n\n===Alternative ways of measuring the size of an angle===\nThere are several alternatives to measuring the size of an angle by the angle of rotation.\nThe ''[[grade (slope)|grade of a slope]]'', or ''gradient'' is equal to the [[tangent (trigonometric function)|tangent]] of the angle, or sometimes (rarely) the [[sine]]. A gradient is often expressed as a percentage. For very small values (less than 5%), the grade of a slope is approximately the measure of the angle in radians.\n\nIn [[rational geometry]] the ''[[spread (rational trigonometry)|spread]]'' between two lines is defined as the square of the sine of the angle between the lines. As the sine of an angle and the sine of its supplementary angle are the same, any angle of rotation that maps one of the lines into the other leads to the same value for the spread between the lines.\n\n===Astronomical approximations===\nAstronomers measure angular separation of objects in degrees from their point of observation.\n* 0.5\u00b0 is approximately the width of the sun or moon.\n* 1\u00b0 is approximately the width of a little finger at arm's length.\n* 10\u00b0 is approximately the width of a closed fist at arm's length.\n* 20\u00b0 is approximately the width of a handspan at arm's length.\n\nThese measurements clearly depend on the individual subject, and the above should be treated as rough [[rule of thumb]] approximations only.\n\n==Angles between curves==\n[[File:Curve angles.svg|thumb|right|The angle between the two curves at ''P'' is defined as the angle between the tangents <var>A</var> and <var>B</var> at <var>P</var>.]]\nThe angle between a line and a [[curve]] (mixed angle) or between two intersecting curves (curvilinear angle) is defined to be the angle between the [[tangent]]s at the point of intersection. Various names (now rarely, if ever, used) have been given to particular cases:\u2014''amphicyrtic'' (Gr. {{lang|grc|\u1f00\u03bc\u03c6\u03af}}, on both sides, \u03ba\u03c5\u03c1\u03c4\u03cc\u03c2, convex) or ''cissoidal'' (Gr. \u03ba\u03b9\u03c3\u03c3\u03cc\u03c2, ivy), biconvex; ''xystroidal'' or ''sistroidal'' (Gr. \u03be\u03c5\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03af\u03c2, a tool for scraping), concavo-convex; ''amphicoelic'' (Gr. \u03ba\u03bf\u03af\u03bb\u03b7, a hollow) or ''angulus lunularis'', biconcave.<ref>{{harvnb|Chisholm|1911}}; {{harvnb|Heiberg|1908|p=178}}</ref><!-- Again, most of this paragraph is from EB1911 with Heath used as its source. -->\n\n==Bisecting and trisecting angles==\n{{Main article|Bisection#Angle bisector|Angle trisection}}\n\nThe [[Greek mathematics|ancient Greek mathematicians]] knew how to bisect an angle (divide it into two angles of equal measure) using only a [[compass and straightedge]], but could only trisect certain angles. In 1837 [[Pierre Wantzel]] showed that for most angles this construction cannot be performed.\n\n==Dot product and generalisations==\nIn the [[Euclidean space]], the angle ''\u03b8'' between two [[Euclidean vector]]s '''u''' and '''v''' is related to their [[dot product]] and their lengths by the formula\n\n:<math> \\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\mathbf{v} = \\cos(\\theta) \\left\\| \\mathbf{u} \\right\\| \\left\\| \\mathbf{v} \\right\\| .</math>\n\nThis formula supplies an easy method to find the angle between two planes (or curved surfaces) from their [[normal vector]]s and between [[skew lines]] from their vector equations.\n\n===Inner product===\nTo define angles in an abstract real [[inner product space]], we replace the Euclidean dot product ( '''\u00b7''' ) by the inner product <math> \\langle \\cdot , \\cdot \\rangle </math>, i.e.\n\n:<math> \\langle \\mathbf{u} , \\mathbf{v} \\rangle = \\cos(\\theta)\\ \\left\\| \\mathbf{u} \\right\\|\\ \\left\\| \\mathbf{v} \\right\\| .</math>\n\nIn a complex [[inner product space]], the expression for the cosine above may give non-real values, so it is replaced with\n\n:<math> \\operatorname{Re} \\left( \\langle \\mathbf{u} , \\mathbf{v} \\rangle \\right) = \\cos(\\theta)\\ \\left\\| \\mathbf{u} \\right\\| \\left\\| \\mathbf{v} \\right\\| .</math>\n\nor, more commonly, using the absolute value, with\n\n:<math> \\left| \\langle \\mathbf{u} , \\mathbf{v} \\rangle \\right| = | \\cos(\\theta) | \\ \\left\\| \\mathbf{u} \\right\\| \\ \\left\\| \\mathbf{v} \\right\\| .</math>\n\nThe latter definition ignores the direction of the vectors and thus describes the angle between one-dimensional subspaces <math>\\operatorname{span}(\\mathbf{u})</math> and <math>\\operatorname{span}(\\mathbf{v})</math> spanned by the vectors <math>\\mathbf{u}</math> and <math>\\mathbf{v}</math> correspondingly.\n\n===Angles between subspaces===\nThe definition of the angle between one-dimensional subspaces <math>\\operatorname{span}(\\mathbf{u})</math> and  <math>\\operatorname{span}(\\mathbf{v})</math> given by\n\n:<math> \\left| \\langle \\mathbf{u} , \\mathbf{v} \\rangle \\right| = |\\cos(\\theta)| \\left\\| \\mathbf{u} \\right\\| \\ \\left\\| \\mathbf{v} \\right\\| </math>\n\nin a [[Hilbert space]] can be extended to subspaces of any finite dimensions. Given two subspaces <math> \\mathcal{U} </math>, <math> \\mathcal{W} </math> with <math> \\dim ( \\mathcal{U}) := k \\leq \\dim ( \\mathcal{W}) := l </math>, this leads to a definition of <math>k</math> angles called canonical or [[principal angles]] between subspaces.\n\n===Angles in Riemannian geometry===\nIn [[Riemannian geometry]], the [[metric tensor]] is used to define the angle between two [[tangent]]s. Where ''U'' and ''V'' are tangent vectors and ''g''<sub>''ij''</sub> are the components of the metric tensor ''G'',\n\n:<math>\n\\cos \\theta = \\frac{g_{ij}U^iV^j}{\\sqrt{ \\left| g_{ij}U^iU^j \\right| \\left| g_{ij}V^iV^j \\right|}}.\n</math>\n\n===Hyperbolic angle===\nA [[hyperbolic angle]] is an [[argument of a function|argument]] of a [[hyperbolic function]] just as the ''circular angle'' is the argument of a [[circular function]]. The comparison can be visualized as the size of the openings of a [[hyperbolic sector]] and a [[circular sector]] since the [[area]]s of these sectors correspond to the angle magnitudes in each case. Unlike the circular angle, the hyperbolic angle is unbounded. When the circular and hyperbolic functions are viewed as [[infinite series]] in their angle argument, the circular ones are just [[alternating series]] forms of the hyperbolic functions. This weaving of the two types of angle and function was explained by [[Leonhard Euler]] in ''[[Introduction to the Analysis of the Infinite]]''.\n\n==Angles in geography and astronomy==\nIn [[geography]], the location of any point on the Earth can be identified using a ''[[geographic coordinate system]]''. This system specifies the [[latitude]] and [[longitude]] of any location in terms of angles subtended at the centre of the Earth, using the [[equator]] and (usually) the [[Greenwich meridian]] as references.\n\nIn [[astronomy]], a given point on the [[celestial sphere]] (that is, the apparent position of an astronomical object) can be identified using any of several ''[[astronomical coordinate systems]]'', where the references vary according to the particular system. Astronomers measure the ''[[angular separation]]'' of two [[star]]s by imagining two lines through the centre of the [[Earth]], each intersecting one of the stars. The angle between those lines can be measured, and is the angular separation between the two stars.\n\nIn both geography and astronomy, a sighting direction can be specified in terms of a [[vertical angle]] such as [[altitude angle|altitude]] /[[elevation angle|elevation]] with respect to the [[horizon]] as well as the [[azimuth]] with respect to [[north]].\n\nAstronomers also measure the ''apparent size'' of objects as an [[angular diameter]]. For example, the [[full moon]] has an angular diameter of approximately 0.5\u00b0, when viewed from Earth. One could say, \"The Moon's diameter subtends an angle of half a degree.\" The [[small-angle formula]] can be used to convert such an angular measurement into a distance/size ratio.\n\n==See also==\n{{div col |colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Bisection#Angle bisector|Angle bisector]]\n* [[Angular velocity]]\n* [[Argument (complex analysis)]]\n* [[Astrological aspect]]\n* [[Central angle]]\n* [[Clock angle problem]]\n* [[Dihedral angle]]\n* [[Exterior angle theorem]]\n* [[Great circle distance]]\n* [[Inscribed angle]]\n* [[Irrational angle]]\n* [[Phase (waves)]]\n* [[Protractor]]\n* [[Solid angle]] for a concept of angle in three dimensions.\n* [[Spherical angle]]\n* [[Transcendent angle]]\n* [[Trisection]]\n* [[Zenith angle]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=\"nb\"}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"Jeans_1947\">{{cite book |author-first=James Hopwood |author-last=Jeans |author-link=James Hopwood Jeans |date=1947 |title=The Growth of Physical Science |publisher=CUP Archive |page=[https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.210060/page/n25 7] |url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.210060}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Murnaghan_1946\">{{cite book |author-first=Francis Dominic |author-last=Murnaghan |author-link=Francis Dominic Murnaghan (mathematician) |date=1946 |title=Analytic Geometry |page=2}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Dimitric_2012\">{{cite journal |title=On Angles and Angle Measurements |author-first=Radoslav M. |author-last=Dimitri\u0107 |journal=The Teaching of Mathematics |date=2012 |volume=XV |number=2 |pages=133\u2013140 |url=http://elib.mi.sanu.ac.rs/files/journals/tm/29/tm1525.pdf |access-date=2019-08-06 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190117195213/http://elib.mi.sanu.ac.rs/files/journals/tm/29/tm1525.pdf |archive-date=2019-01-17}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"ooPIC\">{{cite web |title=ooPIC Programmer's Guide - Chapter 15: URCP |work=[[ooPIC]] Manual & Technical Specifications - ooPIC Compiler Ver 6.0 |orig-year=1997 |date=2007 |publisher=Savage Innovations, LLC |url=http://www.oopic.com/pgchap15.htm |access-date=2019-08-05 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080628051746/http://www.oopic.com/pgchap15.htm |archive-date=2008-06-28}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Hargreaves_2010\">{{cite web |title=Angles, integers, and modulo arithmetic |author-first=Shawn |author-last=Hargreaves |author-link=:pl:Shawn Hargreaves |publisher=blogs.msdn.com |url=http://blogs.msdn.com/shawnhar/archive/2010/01/04/angles-integers-and-modulo-arithmetic.aspx |access-date=2019-08-05 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190630223817/http://www.shawnhargreaves.com/blogindex.html |archive-date=2019-06-03}}</ref>\n}}\n* {{citation |last1=Henderson |first1=David W. |last2=Taimina |first2=Daina |year=2005 |title=Experiencing Geometry / Euclidean and Non-Euclidean with History |edition=3rd |publisher=Pearson Prentice Hall |isbn=978-0-13-143748-7|page=104}}\n* {{citation |last=Heiberg |first=Johan Ludvig |year=1908 |title=Euclid |editor-first=T.
