{"title_page": "Rastafari", "text_new": "{{pp-pc1}}\n{{good article}}\n{{short description|Abrahamic religion formed in 1930s Jamaica}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=November 2015 }}\n{{Use Jamaican English|date=November 2018}}\n[[File:Flag of Ethiopia (1897).svg|thumb|Rastas often claim the [[flag of Ethiopia]] as was used during Haile Selassie's reign. It combines the conquering [[lion of Judah]], symbol of the Ethiopian monarchy, with green, gold, and red.]]\n'''Rastafari''', also known as '''Rastafarianism''', is an [[Abrahamic religion]] that developed in [[Jamaica]] during the 1930s. It is classified as both a [[new religious movement]] and a [[social movement]] by [[Religious studies|scholars of religion]]. There is no central authority in control of the movement and much diversity exists among practitioners, who are known as Rastafari, Rastafarians, or Rastas.\n\nRasta beliefs are based on a specific interpretation of the [[Bible]]. Central is a [[monotheistic]] belief in a single God, referred to as [[Jah]], who partially resides within each individual. Rastafari also maintains that Jah incarnated in human form as [[Jesus of Nazareth|Jesus Christ]]. Rastas accord [[Haile Selassie]], the [[Emperor of Ethiopia]] between 1930 and 1974, central importance; many regard him as the [[Second Coming of Christ]] and thus Jah incarnate, while others see him as a human prophet who fully recognized the inner divinity in every individual. The Rastafari believes is oppressed within Western society, or \"Babylon\". Many Rastas call for this diaspora's resettlement in Africa, a continent they consider the [[Promised Land]] of \"Zion\". Rastas refer to their practices as \"[[Livity (spiritual concept)|livity]]\". Communal meetings are known as \"groundations\", and are typified by music, chanting, discussions, and the [[Entheogenic use of cannabis|smoking of cannabis]], the latter regarded as a [[sacrament]] with beneficial properties. Rastas emphasise what they regard as living \"naturally\", adhering to [[ital]] dietary requirements, twisting their hair into [[dreadlocks]], and following [[patriarchy|patriarchal]] gender roles.\n\nRastafarianism developed simultaneously in various parts of the world after the coronation of the emperor [[Haile Selassie I]] in 1930.\nA very important impact had it in the United States, thanks to a prophecy made by [[Marcus Garvey]], which many of his followers recognized on Haile Selassie.\nRastafarianism accepts all ethnic groups, and is anti-racist, preaches equality and is spread all over the world.\nOne of the nations with major Rastafarian members is [[Jamaica]], where Rastafarianism was brought and preached by [[Leonard Howell]].\nAs Howell said, he learned Rastafari by traveling the world, and in [] the United States of America]] approached this faith, and then successfully preached it in [[Jamaica]].\nThere are various Rastafarian orders, the most famous are the [[Nyabinghi]], [[Boboshanti]], [[Twelve tribes Israel]], the [[Ethiopian World Federation]] and many internation order.\n\n==Definition==\n\nRastafari has been described as a religion,{{sfnm|1a1=Gjerset|1y=1994|1p=75, 76|2a1=Loadenthal|2y=2013|2p=3}} meeting many of the proposed definitions for what constitutes a religion,{{sfn|Chawane|2014|p=216}} and is legally recognised as such in various countries.{{sfn|Mhango|2008|pp=223, 225\u2013226}} [[Religious studies|Scholars of religion]] have categorised Rastafari as a [[new religious movement]].{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=11|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=92|3a1=Sibanda|3y=2016|3p=182}} Others have proposed additional classifications: Leonard E. Barrett referred to it as a [[sect]],{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=viii}} while [[Sheila Kitzinger]] and Ernest Cashmore called it a [[cult]],{{sfnm|1a1=Kitzinger|1y=1969|1p=240|2a1=Cashmore|2y=1983|2p=6}} and Ennis B. Edmonds argued that it could best be understood as a [[revitalization movement]].{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=92}} Edmonds also suggested that Rastafari was \"emerging\" as a [[world religion]], not because of the number of adherents that it had, but because of its global spread.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=71\u201372}} Although Rastafari focuses on Africa as a source of identity, Maboula Soumahoro noted that it was not an \"authentic\" African religion but an example of [[creolization]], a product of the unique social environment that existed in the Americas.{{sfn|Soumahoro|2007|p=43}} Katrin Hansing described it as \"one of the leading Afro-Caribbean religions\".{{sfnm|1a1=Hansing|1y=2001|1p=733|2a1=Hansing|2y=2006|2p=62}} Many Rastas nevertheless dislike the notion that Rastafari should be called a religion, instead referring to it as a \"way of life\",{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1p=188|2a1=Bedasse|2y=2010|2p=267|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=92|4a1=Glazier|4y=2012|4p=614|5a1=Chawane|5y=2014|5p=214}} a \"[[philosophy]]\",{{sfn|Loadenthal|2013|p=6}} or as a \"[[spirituality]]\".{{sfn|Chawane|2014|p=214}}\n\n[[File:Street vendors in Zeerust.jpg|thumb|left|Two Rasta street vendors in [[Zeerust]], [[South Africa]]; they are wearing and selling items that display their commitment to the religion]]\n\nOther scholars have categorized it in different ways.

the term \"Ethiopia\" synonymously with \"Africa\".{{sfnm|1a1=Kitzinger|1y=1969|1p=240|2a1=Middleton|2y=2006|2p=163}} Other Rastas apply the term \"Zion\" to Jamaica or use it to describe a state of mind.{{sfn|Barnett|2005|p=77}} In placing emphasis on Africa as the Promised Land, Rastas reflect their desire to escape what they perceive as the domination and degradation that they experience in Babylon.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=41}} During the first three decades of the Rastafari movement, it placed strong emphasis on the need for the African diaspora to be repatriated to Africa.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=41}} To this end, various Rastas lobbied the Jamaican government and [[United Nations]] to oversee this resettlement process.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=41}} Other Rastas organised their own transportation to the African continent.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=41}} Critics of the movement have argued that the migration of the entire African diaspora to Africa is implausible, particularly as no African country would welcome this.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=127}}\n\nBy the movement's fourth decade, the desire for physical repatriation to Africa had declined among Rastas.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=42}} This change was influenced by observation of the [[1983\u20131985 famine in Ethiopia]].{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=99}} Rather, many Rastas saw the idea of returning to Africa in a metaphorical sense, entailing restoring their pride and self-confidence as people of black African descent.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=100|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=42|3a1=Bedasse|3y=2013|3p=294}}

may more comfortably live within it rather than seeking to move to Africa.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=85}} There are nevertheless many Rastas who continue to emphasise the need for physical resettlement of the African diaspora in Africa.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=42}} Some Rastas living elsewhere in Africa see no need to migrate to Ethiopia specifically because they believe that all of Africa falls under the Biblical understanding of \"Ethiopia\"; thus, Rastas in Ghana for instance described themselves as already living within \"Ethiopia\".{{sfn|Middleton|2006|p=163}}\n\n====Salvation and

that the world's white people would wipe themselves out through [[nuclear war]],{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=119}} with black Africans then ruling the world, something that they argue is prophesied in the [[Book of Daniel]] (2:31\u201332).{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=119}}\n\nRastas do not believe that there is a specific [[afterlife]] to which human individuals go following bodily

Jah.{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=112}} He suggested that this attitude stemmed from the large numbers of young people that were then members of the movement, and who had thus seen only few Rastas die.{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=113}} In keeping with their views on death, Rastas eschew celebrating physical death and often avoid

endorses the idea that Africa is the \"natural\" abode of black Africans, a continent where they can live according to African culture and tradition and be themselves on a physical, emotional, and intellectual level.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=82}} Practitioners believe that Westerners and Babylon have detached themselves from nature through technological development and thus have become debilitated, slothful, and decadent.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=83|2a1=Barnett|2y=2002|2p=57}} Some Rastas express the view that they should adhere to what they regard as African laws rather than the laws of Babylon, thus defending their involvement in certain acts which may be illegal in the countries that they are living in.{{sfn|Cashmore|1981|p=177}} In emphasising his Afrocentric approach, Rastafari expresses overtones of [[black nationalism]].{{sfn|Watson|1973|p=192}}\n\nMaureen Warner-Lewis observed that Rastafari combined a \"radical, even revolutionary\" stance on socio-political issues, particularly regarding race, with a \"profoundly traditional\" approach to \"philosophical conservatism\" on other religious issues.{{sfn|Warner-Lewis|1993|p=122}} Rastas typically look critically upon modern capitalism with its consumerism and materialism.{{sfn|Barnett|2002|p=54}} They favour small-scale, pre-industrial and agricultural societies.{{sfn|Barnett|2002|p=57}} Some Rastas have promoted activism as a means of achieving socio-political change, while others believe in awaiting change that will be brought about through divine intervention in human affairs.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=50}} In Jamaica, Rastas typically do not vote,{{sfnm|1a1=Kitzinger|1y=1969|1p=247|2a1=Chevannes|2y=1994|2p=150|3a1=Barrett|3y=1997|3p=220}} derogatorily dismissing politics as \"politricks\".{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=220}} The Rasta tendency to believe that socio-political change is inevitable opens the religion up to the criticism from the [[Left-wing politics|political left]] that it encouraged adherents to do little or nothing to change the status quo.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1981|1pp=175\u2013176, 179|2a1=Barnett|2y=2006|2p=891}} Other Rastas do engage in political activism; the Ghanaian Rasta singer-songwriter [[Rocky Dawuni]] for instance was involved in campaigns promoting democratic elections,{{sfn|Middleton|2006|pp=165\u2013167}} while in [[Grenada]], many

men.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=85}} Rastafari women usually accept this subordinate position and regard it as their duty to obey their men;{{sfn|Cashmore|1981|p=178}} the academic Maureen Rowe suggested that women were willing to join the religion despite its restrictions because they valued the life of structure and discipline it provided.{{sfn|Rowe|1980|p=16}} Rasta discourse often presents women as morally weak and susceptible to deception by [[evil]],{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=97}} and claims that they are impure while [[menstruation|menstruating]].{{sfnm|1a1=Rowe|1y=1980|1p=15|2a1=Lake|2y=1994|2p=244|3a1=Sabelli|3y=2011|3p=141|4a1=Edmonds|4y=2012|4p=98}} Rastas legitimise these gender roles by citing Biblical

in favour of long skirts;{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=98}} women are expected to cover their head while praying,{{sfn|Rowe|1980|p=15}} and in some Rasta groups this is expected of them whenever in public.{{sfn|Barnett|2006|p=889}} Rasta discourse insists this female dress code is necessary to prevent women attracting men and presents it as an antidote to the [[sexual objectification]] of women in Babylon.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=98, 99}} Rasta men are permitted to wear whatever they choose.{{sfnm|1a1=Barnett|1y=2002|1p=55|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=98}} Although men and women took part in early Rasta rituals alongside each other, from the late 1940s and 1950s a more radical movement within the Rasta community encouraged gender segregation for ceremonies.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=95}} This was legitimised with the explanation that women were impure through menstruation and that their presence at the ceremonies would distract male participants.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=95}}\n\nAs it existed in Jamaica, Rastafari did not promote monogamy.{{sfn|Kitzinger|1966|p=38}} Rasta men are permitted multiple female sex partners,{{sfnm|1a1=Lake|1y=1994|1p=252|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=99}} while women are expected to reserve their sexual activity for their one male partner.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=99}} Marriage is not usually formalised through legal ceremonies but is a [[common law marriage|common law]]

relationships are known as \"kingmen\".{{sfnm|1a1=Lake|1y=1994|1p=245|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=99}} Rastafari places great importance on family life and the raising of children,{{sfn|Clarke|1986|pp=87\u201388}} with reproduction being encouraged.{{sfn|Kitzinger|1966|p=37}} The religion emphasises the place of men in child-rearing, associating this with the recovery of African manhood.{{sfnm|1a1=Kebede|1a2=Knottnerus|1y=1998|1p=504|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2pp=103\u2013104}} Women often work, sometimes while the man is left to raise the children at

By the 8th century, Arab traders had introduced cannabis to Central and Southern Africa.{{sfn|Hamid|2002|p=xxxii}} In the 19th century, enslaved [[Kongo people|Bakongo]] people arrived in Jamaica, where they established the religion of [[Kumina]]. In Kumina, cannabis was smoked during religious ceremonies in the belief that it facilitated possession by ancestral spirits.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=55}} The religion was largely practiced in south-east Jamaica's [[Saint Thomas Parish, Jamaica|Saint Thomas Parish]], where a prominent early Rasta, [[Leonard Howell]], lived while he was developing many of Rastafari's beliefs and practices; it may have been through Kumina that cannabis became part of Rastafari.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=55}} A second possible source was the use of cannabis in [[Hinduism|Hindu]] rituals.{{sfnm|1a1=Benard|1y=2007|1p=95, 96|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=55}} Hindu migrants arrived in Jamaica as indentured servants from [[British India]] between 1834 and 1917, and brought cannabis with them.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=55}} A Jamaican Hindu priest, Laloo, was one of Howell's spiritual advisors, and may have influenced his adoption of ganja.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=55}}\n\nThe adoption of cannabis may also have been influenced by the widespread medicinal and recreational use of cannabis among Afro-Jamaicans in the early 20th century.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=55}} Early Rastafarians may have taken an element of Jamaican culture which they associated with their peasant past and the rejection of capitalism and sanctified it by according it Biblical correlates.{{sfn|Benard|2007|pp=91\u201392}} In many countries, cannabis is illegal and by using it, Rastas protest the rules and regulations of Babylon;{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=129}} in the United States, for example, thousands of practitioners have been arrested because of their possession of the drug.{{sfn|Loadenthal|2013|p=5}}  Rastas have also advocated for the legalisation of cannabis in those jurisdictions where it is illegal.{{sfnm|1a1=Barnett|1y=2005|1p=76|2a1=Barnett|2y=2006|2p=892|3a1=Sibanda|3y=2016|3p=184}} In November 2019, the government of [[Barbados]] passed legislation allowing for Rastafarians to use cannabis for religious reasons, provided that groups first follow certain provisions.<ref>{{cite news |last= |first= |date=24 November 2019 |title=Government passes ganja legislation for Rastafarians, conditions apply |url=http://www.loopnewsbarbados.com/content/rastas-get-ganja-permission-conditions# |work=Loop |access-date=19 February 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Music===\n[[File:RastaBongo.jpg|thumb|right|A Rasta using a bongo drum]]\nRastafari music developed at reasoning sessions,{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=93}} where drumming, chanting, and dancing are all present.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=58}} Rasta music is performed to praise and commune with Jah,{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=94}} and to reaffirm the rejection of Babylon.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=94}} Rastas believe that their music has healing properties, with the ability to cure colds, fevers, and headaches.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=94}} Many of these songs are sung to the tune of older Christian hymns,{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=94|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=123|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=58}} but others are original Rasta creations.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=94}}\n\nThe bass-line of Rasta music is provided by the [[akete]], a three-drum set, which is accompanied by [[percussion instruments]] like [[rattle (percussion instrument)|rattle]]s and [[tambourine]]s.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=58}} A syncopated rhythm is then provided by the [[fundeh]] drum.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=58}} In addition, a [[peta (drum)|peta]] drum improvises over the rhythm.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=58}} The different components of the music are regarded as displaying different symbolism; the bassline symbolises blows against Babylon, while the lighter beats denote hope for the future.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=58}}\n\nAs Rastafari developed, popular music became its chief communicative medium.{{sfn|King|2002|p=5}} During the 1950s, [[ska]] was a popular musical style in Jamaica, and although its protests against social and political conditions were mild, it gave early expression to Rasta socio-political ideology.{{sfn|King|2002|p=4}} Particularly prominent in the connection between Rastafari and ska were the musicians [[Count Ossie]] and [[Don Drummond]].{{sfnm|1a1=King|1y=2002|1p=24|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=115}} Ossie was a drummer who believed that black people needed to develop their own style of music;{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=93|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=162}} he was heavily influenced by [[Kumina]] and [[Burru]], two drumming styles developed by African-Jamaicans.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=113}} Ossie subsequently popularised this new Rastafari ritual music by playing at various groundings and groundations around Jamaica,{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=113}} with songs like \"Another Moses\" and \"Babylon Gone\" reflecting Rasta influence.{{sfn|King|2002|p=24}} Rasta themes also appeared in Drummond's work, with songs such as \"Reincarnation\" and \"Tribute to Marcus Garvey\".{{sfn|King|2002|p=24}}\n\n1968 saw the development of [[reggae]] in Jamaica, a musical style typified by slower, heavier rhythms than ska and the increased use of [[patois]].{{sfn|King|2002|p=46}} Although like [[calypso music|calypso]], reggae was a medium for [[social commentary]],{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=vii}} it demonstrated a wider use of radical political and Rasta themes than were previously present in Jamaican popular music.{{sfn|King|2002|p=46}} Reggae artists incorporated Rasta ritual rhythms,{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=117}} and also adopted Rasta chants, language, motifs, and social critiques.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=117}} Songs like [[The Wailers]]' \"[[African Herbsman]]\" and [[Peter Tosh]]'s \"Legalize It\" referenced cannabis use,{{sfn|King|2002|p=57}} while tracks like [[The Melodians]]' \"[[Rivers of Babylon]]\" and [[Junior Byles]]' \"Beat Down Babylon\" referenced Rasta beliefs in Babylon.{{sfn|King|2002|p=56}} Reggae gained widespread international popularity during the mid-1970s,{{sfn|King|2002|p=96}} coming to be viewed as music of the oppressed by black people in many different countries.{{sfn|King|2002|p=100}} Many Rastas grew critical of reggae, believing that it had commercialised their religion.{{sfn|King|2002|p=102}} Although reggae contains much Rastafari symbolism,{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=viii}} and the two are widely associated,{{sfn|King|2002|p=xiii}} the connection is often exaggerated by non-Rastas.{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=245}} Most Rastas do not listen to reggae music,{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=245}} and reggae has also been utilised by other religious groups, such as evangelical Protestants.{{sfn|Rommen|2006|pp=235\u2013236}} Out of reggae came [[dub music]];

it has been adopted from the [[Flag of Jamaica|Jamaican flag]],{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=143}} and is often interpreted as symbolising the minerals and raw materials which constitute Africa's wealth.{{sfn|White|2010|p=307}} Rastas often paint these colours onto their buildings, vehicles, kiosks, and other items,{{sfn|White|2010|p=308}} or display them on their clothing, helping to demarcate Rastas from non-Rastas and allowing adherents to recognise their co-religionists.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=160}} As well as being used by Rastas, the colour set has also been adopted by Pan-Africanists more broadly, who use it to display their identification with Afrocentricity;{{sfn|White|2010|p=307}} for this reason it was adopted on the flags of many post-independence African states.{{sfn|White|2010|p=308}} Rastas often accompany the use of these three or four colours with the image of the [[Lion of Judah]], also adopted from the Ethiopian flag and symbolizing Haile Selassie.{{sfn|White|2010|p=308}}\n\n===Diet===\n{{Main|Ital}}\n\n[[File:Ital food - 01.jpg|thumb|right|An ital breakfast;

Here, they were sold to European planters and forced to work on the plantations.{{sfn|Chevannes|1994|p=2}} Around a third of these transported Africans were relocated in the Caribbean, with under 700,000 being settled in Jamaica.{{sfn|Chevannes|1994|p=2}} In 1834, slavery in Jamaica was abolished after the British government passed the [[Slavery Abolition Act 1833]].{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=24|2a1=Chevannes|2y=1994|2p=3}} Racial prejudice nevertheless remained prevalent across Jamaican society,{{sfn|Chevannes|1994|p=3}} with the overwhelming majority of Jamaica's legislative council remaining white throughout the nineteenth century,{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=25}} and those of African descent being treated as [[second-class citizen]]s.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=24}}\n\nChristian Revivalism was a key influence on Rastafari.{{sfn|Chevannes|1994|p=120}} Many Afro-Jamaicans joined Christian churches during the Great Revival of 1860\u201361.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=25|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=21}} They brought with them many inherited African beliefs and rituals, which syncretised with Christianity in various ways and to varying degrees.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=25}} Some of the new religions that emerged, such as Pukkumina, remained heavily based on traditional African religion, while others, like Revival Zion, were more fully Christian.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=25|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=22}} The majority of these groups practiced spiritual healing and incorporated drumming and chanting, counselling, and spirit possession into their structures.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=26}} Increasing numbers of [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]] missionaries from the United States arrived in Jamaica during the early twentieth century, reaching a climax in the 1920s.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=26|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=25}} They provided a way for black Jamaicans\u2014who continued to live with the social memory of enslavement and who were denied any substantial participation in Jamaica's political institutions\u2014to express their hopes, fears, and aspirations.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=26}}\n\n===Ethiopianism, Back to Africa, and Marcus Garvey===\n\n[[File:Marcus Garvey 1924-08-05.jpg|thumb|upright|Marcus Garvey, a prominent black nationalist theorist who heavily influenced Rastafari and is regarded as a prophet by many Rastas]]\nAccording to Edmonds, Rastafari emerged from \"the convergence of several religious, cultural, and intellectual streams\",{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=7}} while fellow scholar Wigmoore Francis described it as owing much of its self-understanding to \"intellectual and conceptual frameworks\" dating from the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.{{sfn|Francis|2013|p=52}} Both [[Ethiopianism]] and the [[Back to Africa]] ethos remain \"fundamental ingredients of Rastafarian ideology\".{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=27}} These two movements predated Rastafari and can be traced back to the eighteenth century.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|pp=27\u201328}}\n\nIn the nineteenth century, there were growing calls for the African diaspora located in Western Europe and the Americas to be resettled in Africa.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|pp=27\u201328}} In that century, many members of the African diaspora were moved to Sierra Leone and Liberia.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|pp=27\u201328}} Based in Liberia, the black Christian preacher [[Edward Wilmot Blyden]] began promoting African pride and the preservation of African tradition, customs, and institutions.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1pp=29\u201334|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2pp=75\u201376|3a1=Francis|3y=2013|3pp=54\u201356}} Blyden sought to promote a form of Christianity that was suited to the African context,{{sfn|Clarke|1986|pp=32\u201333}} and believed that black people had to acquire their own historical knowledge about themselves.{{sfn|Francis|2013|p=66}} The idea of the African diaspora's return to Africa was given impetus by the creation of the [[Israel|State of Israel]] in 1948 as a nation-state for the [[Jewish diaspora]] to return to.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=18}}\n\nAlso spreading through Africa was Ethiopianism, a movement that accorded special status to the east African nation of Ethiopia because it was mentioned in various Biblical passages.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=34|2a1=Chawane|2y=2014|2p=221}} For adherents of Ethiopianism, \"Ethiopia\" was regarded as a synonym of Africa as a whole.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=34}} Across the continent, although particularly in South Africa, Christian churches were established that referred to themselves as \"Ethiopian\"; these groups were at the forefront of the burgeoning African nationalist movement that sought liberation from European colonial rule.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|pp=34\u201335}}\n\nOf significant influence on Rastafari was the Jamaican-born activist Marcus Garvey, who spent much of his adult life in the United States and United Kingdom.

charisma|routinization]],{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=146}} with the late 1960s witnessing the launch of the first official Rastafarian newspaper, the [[Rastafarian Movement Association]]'s ''Rasta Voice''.{{sfn|King|2002|p=52}} The decade also saw Rastafari develop in increasingly complex ways.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=51}} During that decade, some Rastas began to reinterpret the idea that salvation required a physical return to Africa, instead interpreting salvation as coming through a process of mental decolonisation that embraced African approaches to life.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=51}}\n\nWhereas its membership had previously come predominantly from poorer sectors of Jamaican society, in the 1960s Rastafari began to attract support from more privileged groups like students and professional musicians.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=51|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=25}} The foremost group emphasising this approach were the Twelve Tribes of Israel, whose members came to be known as \"Uptown Rastas\".{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=25}} Among those attracted to Rastafari in this decade were middle-class intellectuals like [[Leahcim Semaj]], who called for the religious community to place greater emphasis on scholarly social theory as a method of achieving change.{{sfn|King|2002|p=103}} Although some Jamaican Rastas were critical of him,{{sfn|King|2002|p=81}} many came under the influence of the Guyanese black nationalist academic [[Walter Rodney]], who lectured to their community in 1968 before publishing his thoughts as the pamphlet ''Groundings''.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=52|2a1=Bedasse|2y=2013|2pp=297-298|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=26}} Like Rodney, many Jamaican Rastas were influenced by the U.S.-based [[Black Power]] movement.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=54|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2pp=25\u201326}} After Black Power declined following the deaths of prominent exponents such as [[Malcolm X]], [[Michael X]], and [[George Jackson (activist)|George Jackson]], Rastafari filled the vacuum it left for many black youth.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=55}}\n\n===International spread and decline: 1970\u2013present===\n[[File:Rasta vendor with hat and glass Obama mug Inauguration 2013.jpg|thumb|upright|A Rasta vendor plies his wares in the U.S. city of [[Washington D.C.]] in 2013]]\n\nIn the mid-1970s, reggae's international popularity exploded.{{sfn|King|2002|p=96}} The most successful reggae artist was Bob Marley, who\u2014according to Cashmore\u2014\"more than any other individual, was responsible for introducing Rastafarian themes, concepts and demands to a truly universal audience\".{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=108}} Reggae's popularity led to a growth in \"pseudo-Rastafarians\", individuals who listened to reggae and wore Rasta clothing but did not share its belief system.{{sfn|King|2002|pp=100, 102}} Many Rastas were angered by this, believing it commercialised their religion.{{sfn|King|2002|p=102}}\n\nThrough reggae, Rasta musicians became increasingly important in Jamaica's political life during the 1970s.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=53}} In his desire to move towards [[democratic socialism]], Jamaican Prime Minister [[Michael Manley]] employed some Rasta imagery, and also courted and obtained support from Marley and other reggae musicians, thus helping to bolster his popularity with the electorate.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=52|2a1=Lewis|2y=1993|2p=12|3a1=Lewis|3y=1994|3pp=290\u2013291|4a1=King|4y=2002|4pp=105, 108\u2013111}} Manley described Rastas as a \"beautiful and remarkable people\",{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=ix}} and carried a cane, the \"rod of correction\", which he claimed was a gift from Haile Selassie.{{sfnm|1a1=Barrett|1y=1997|1p=220|2a1=King|2y=1998|2p=41|3a1=King|3y=2002|3pp=91\u201392|4a1=Edmonds|4y=2012|4p=27}} Following Manley's example, Jamaican political groups increasingly employed Rasta language, symbols, and reggae references in their campaigns,{{sfnm|1a1=Lewis|1y=1994|1p=12|2a1=Lewis|2y=1994|2p=291|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=27}} while Rasta symbols became increasingly mainstream in Jamaican society.{{sfn|King|2002|p=106}} This helped to confer greater legitimacy on Rastafari,{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=27}} with reggae and Rasta imagery being increasingly presented as a core part of Jamaica's [[cultural heritage]] for the marketing purposes of the growing tourist industry.{{sfn|King|2002|pp=121\u2013122}}\n\nEnthusiasm for Rastafari was likely dampened by the death of Haile Selassie in 1975 and that of Marley in 1981.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=28}} During the 1980s, the number of Rastas in Jamaica declined,{{sfn|King|2002|p=120}} with Pentecostal and other Charismatic Christian groups proving more successful at attracting young recruits.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=29}} Several publicly prominent Rastas converted to Christianity,{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=29}} and two of those who did so\u2014[[Judy Mowatt]] and [[Tommy Cowan]]\u2014maintained that Marley had converted from Rastafari to Christianity, in the form of the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Church]], during his final days.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=29\u201330}} The significance of Rastafari messages in reggae also declined with the growing popularity of [[dancehall]], a Jamaican musical genre that typically foregrounded lyrical themes of hyper-masculinity, violence, and sexual activity rather than religious symbolism.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=30}} However, in the 1980s, a Rasta practitioner, [[Barbara Makeda Blake Hannah]], was appointed a Senator in the Jamaican Parliament.{{sfn|Semaj|2013|p=98}}\n\nThe mid-1990s saw a revival of Rastafari-focused reggae associated with musicians like [[Anthony B]], [[Buju Banton]], [[Luciano]], [[Sizzla]], and [[Capleton]].{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=30}} From the 1990s, Jamaica also witnessed the growth of organised political activity within the Rasta community, seen for instance through campaigns for the legalisation of marijuana and the creation of political parties like the [[Jamaican Alliance Movement]] and the [[Imperial Ethiopian World Federation Incorporated Political Party]], none of which attained more than minimal electoral support.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=30\u201331}} In 1995, the Rastafari Centralization Organization was established in Jamaica as an attempt to organise the Rastafari community.{{sfn|Barnett|2002|p=56}}\n\n==Organization==\n\nRastafari is not a homogeneous movement and has no single administrative structure,{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=52}} nor any single leader.{{sfnm|1a1=Barrett|1y=1997|1p=91|2a1=King|2y=2002|2p=xvii}} Rastas avoid centralised and hierarchical structures because they do not want to replicate the structures of Babylon and because their religion's ultra-individualistic ethos places emphasis on inner divinity.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=52\u201353}} The structure of Rastafari groups is less like those of Christian denominations and is instead akin to the cellular structure of other African diasporic traditions like [[Haitian Vodou]], Cuban [[Santer\u00eda]], and Jamaica's [[Revival Zion]].{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=52}} Since the 1970s, there have been attempts to unify all Rastas, namely through the establishment of the [[Rastafari Movement Association]], which sought political mobilisation.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=69}} In 1982, the first international assembly of Rastafari groups took place in [[Toronto]], Canada.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=69}} This and subsequent international conferences, assemblies, and workshops have helped to cement global networks and cultivate an international community of Rasta practitioners.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=88\u201389}}\n\n===Mansions of Rastafari===\n\n{{Main|Mansions of Rastafari}}\n\n[[File:ReggaeV4.0.png|thumb|right|A stylized Rastafari motif, depicting the [[Lion of Judah]]]]\n\nSub-divisions of Rastafari are often referred to as \"houses\" or \"mansions\", in keeping with a passage from the [[Gospel of John]] (14:2): as translated in the [[King James Bible]], Jesus states \"In my father's house are many mansions\".{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=62}} The three most prominent branches are the House of Nyabinghi, the Bobo Ashanti, and the Twelve Tribes of Israel, although other important groups include the Church of Haile Selassie I, Inc., and the Fulfilled Rastafari.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=62}}\n\nProbably the largest Rastafari group, the [[Nyabinghi|House of Nyabinghi]] is an aggregate of more traditional and militant Rastas who seek to retain the movement close to the way in which it existed during the 1940s.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=62}} They stress the idea that Haile Selassie was Jah and the reincarnation of Jesus.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=62}} The wearing of dreadlocks is regarded as indispensable and patriarchal gender roles are strongly emphasised,{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=62}} while, according to Cashmore, they are  \"vehemently anti-white\".{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=25}} Nyabinghi Rastas refuse to compromise with Babylon, and are often critical of reggae musicians like Marley, whom they regard as having collaborated with the commercial music industry.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=59, 62}}\n\nThe [[Bobo Ashanti]] sect was founded in Jamaica by [[Charles Edwards (Rastafarian)|Emanuel Charles Edwards]] through the establishment of his Ethiopia Africa Black International Congress (EABIC) in 1958.{{sfnm|1a1=Edmonds|1y=2012|1p=63|2a1=Merritt|2y=2017|2p=285}} The group established a commune in [[Bull Bay]], where they were led by Edwards until his 1994 death.{{sfnm|1a1=Edmonds|1y=2012|1p=64|2a1=Merritt|2y=2017|2pp=285\u2013286}} The group hold to a highly rigid ethos.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=64}} Edwards advocated the idea of a new trinity, with Haile Selassie as the living God, himself as the Christ, and Garvey as the prophet.{{sfnm|1a1=Barrett|1y=1997|1p=182|2a1=Barnett|2y=2005|2p=69|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=64}} Male members are divided into two categories: the \"priests\" who conduct religious services and the \"prophets\" who take place in reasoning sessions.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=64}} It places greater restrictions on women than most other forms of Rastafari;{{sfn|Barnett|2005|p=69}} women are regarded as impure because of menstruation and childbirth, and so are not permitted to cook for men.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=64}} The group teaches that black Africans are God's chosen people and are superior to white Europeans,{{sfnm|1a1=Barnett|1y=2005|1p=69|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=64}} with members often refusing to associate with white people.{{sfn|Middleton|2006|p=157}} Bobo Ashanti Rastas are recognisable by their long, flowing robes and turbans.{{sfnm|1a1=Lake|1y=1994|1p=247|2a1=Barnett|2y=2005|2p=69|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=64}}\n\n[[File:Twelve Tribes of Israel headquarters.jpg|thumb|left|The headquarters of the Twelve Tribes of Israel organisation in Shashamane, Ethiopia]]\n\nThe [[Twelve Tribes of Israel (Rastafari)|Twelve Tribes of Israel]] sect was founded in 1968 in Kingston by [[Vernon Carrington]].{{sfnm|1a1=Lewis|1y=1993|1p=11|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=227|3a1=Bedasse|3y=2010|3pp=961, 962|4a1=Edmonds|4y=2012|4p=64}} He proclaimed himself the reincarnation of the Old Testament prophet [[Gad (son of Jacob)|Gad]] and his followers call him \"Prophet Gad\", \"Brother Gad\", or \"Gadman\".{{sfnm|1a1=Rubenstein|1a2=Suarez|1y=1994|1p=2|2a1=Bedasse|2y=2010|2p=962|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=64}} It is commonly regarded as the most liberal form of Rastafari and the closest to Christianity;{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=36}} some Rastas regard it as being heretical.{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=323}} Practitioners are often dubbed \"Christian Rastas\" because they believe Jesus is the only saviour; Haile Selassie is accorded importance, but is not viewed as the second coming of Jesus.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=67}} The group divides its members into twelve groups according to which [[Hebrew calendar]] month they were born; each month is associated with a particular colour, body part, and mental function.{{sfnm|1a1=Barrett|1y=1997|1p=229|2a1=Barnett|2y=2005|2p=68|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=65}} Maintaining dreadlocks and an ital diet are considered commendable but not essential,{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=66\u201367}} while adherents are called upon to read a chapter of the Bible each day.{{sfnm|1a1=Edmonds|1y=2012|1p=68|2a1=Barnett|2y=2005|2p=67|3a1=Bedasse|3y=2013|3p=302}} Membership is open to individuals of any racial background.{{sfn|Barnett|2005|p=68}}\n\nThe Twelve Tribes peaked in popularity during the 1970s, when it attracted artists, musicians, and many middle-class followers, resulting in the term \"middle-class Rastas\" and \"uptown Rastas\" being applied to members of the group.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=68}} Marley was one such of these musicians belonging to the Twelve Tribes.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1p=54|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=230}} Carrington died in 2005, since which time the Twelve Tribes of Israel have been led by an executive council.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=68}} As of 2010, it was recorded as being the largest of the centralized Rasta groups.{{sfn|Bedasse|2010|p=961}} It remains headquartered in Kingston, although has followers outside Jamaica;{{sfn|Bedasse|2010|pp=961\u2013962}} it was responsible for establishing the Rasta community in Shashame, Ethiopia.{{sfnm|1a1=Lewis|1y=1993|1p=11|2a1=Rubenstein|2a2=Suarez|2y=1994|2p=4}}\n\nThe Church of Haile Selassie, Inc was founded by Abuna Foxe, and operated much like a mainstream Christian church, with a hierarchy of functionaries, weekly services, and [[Sunday schools]].{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=68\u201369}} In adopting this broad approach, the Church seeks to develop Rastafari's respectability in wider society.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=69}} Fulfilled Rastafari is a multi-ethnic movement that has spread in popularity during the twenty-first century, in large part through the [[Internet]].{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=69}} The Fulfilled Rastafari group accept Haile Selassie's statements that he was a man and that he was a devout Christian, and so place emphasis on worshipping Jesus through the example set forth by Haile Selassie.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=69}} The wearing of dreadlocks and the adherence to an ital diet are considered issues up to the individual.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=69}}\n\n==Demographics==\n\n{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote=Born in the ghettos of Kingston, Jamaica, the Rastafarian movement has captured the imagination of thousands of black youth, and some white youth, throughout Jamaica, the Caribbean, Britain, France, and other countries in Western Europe and North America. It is also to be found in smaller numbers in parts of Africa\u2014for example, in Ethiopia, Ghana, and Senegal\u2014and in Australia and New Zealand, particularly among the Maori.|source=\u2014 Sociologist of religion [[Peter B. Clarke]], 1986{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=17}} }}\n\nAs of 2012, there were an estimated 700,000 to 1 million Rastas worldwide.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=71}} They can be found in many different regions, including most of the world's major population centers.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=71}} Rastafari's influence on wider society has been more substantial than its numerical size,{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=14|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=71}} particularly in fostering a racial, political, and cultural consciousness among the African diaspora, Africans themselves, and other dominated communities across the world.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=71}} Men dominate Rastafari.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=94}} In its early years, most of its followers were men, and the women who did adhere to it tended to remain in the background.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=94}} This picture of Rastafari's demographics has been confirmed by ethnographic studies conducted in the late twentieth and twenty-first centuries.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=94\u201395}}\n\nThe Rasta message resonates with many people who feel marginalised and alienated by the values and institutions of their society.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=89}} Internationally, it has proved most popular among the poor and among marginalised youth.{{sfn|Hansing|2006|p=63}} In valorising Africa and blackness, Rastafari provides a positive identity for youth in the African diaspora by allowing them to psychologically reject their social stigmatisation.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=89}} It then provides these disaffected people with the discursive stance from which they can challenge capitalism and consumerism, providing them with symbols of resistance and defiance.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=89}} Cashmore expressed the view that \"whenever there are black people who sense an injust disparity between their own material conditions and those of the whites who surround them and tend to control major social institutions, the Rasta messages have relevance.\"{{sfn|Cashmore|1984|p=3}}\n\n===Conversion and deconversion===\n\nRastafari is a non-missionary religion.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=85}} However, elders from Jamaica often go \"trodding\" to instruct new converts in the fundamentals of the religion.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=85}} On researching English Rastas during the 1970s, Cashmore noted that they had not [[religious conversion|converted]] instantaneously, but rather had undergone \"a process of drift\" through which they gradually adopted Rasta beliefs and practices, resulting in their ultimate acceptance of Haile Selassie's central importance.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=55}} Rastas often claim that\u2014rather than converting to the religion\u2014they were actually always a Rasta and that their embrace of its beliefs was merely the realisation of this.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=6}} There is no formal ritual carried out to mark an individual's entry into the Rastafari movement.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=128}} Rastas regard themselves as an exclusive and elite community, membership of which is restricted to those who have the \"insight\" to recognise Haile Selassie's importance.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=9}} Practitioners thus often regard themselves as the \"enlightened ones\" who have \"seen the light\".{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=57}} Many see no point in establishing good relations with non-Rastas, believing that the latter will never accept Rastafari doctrine as truth.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|pp=57\u201358}}\n\nSome Rastas have left the religion. Clarke noted that among British Rastas, some returned to Pentecostalism and other forms of Christianity, while others embraced [[Islam]] or no religion.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=59}} Some English ex-Rastas described disillusionment when the societal transformation promised by Rastafari failed to appear, while others felt that while Rastafari would be appropriate for agrarian communities in Africa and the Caribbean, it was not suited to industrialised British society.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=59}} Some experienced disillusionment after developing the view that Haile Selassie had been an oppressive leader of the Ethiopian people.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=59}} Cashmore found that some British Rastas who had more militant views left the religion after finding its focus on reasoning and music insufficient for the struggle against white domination and racism.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=97}}\n\n===Regional spread===\n\nAlthough it remains most concentrated in the Caribbean,{{sfn|Loadenthal|2013|p=2}} Rastafari has spread to many areas of the world and adapted into many localised variants.{{sfn|Hansing|2001|p=733}} It has spread primarily in Anglophone regions and countries, largely because reggae music has primarily been produced in the English language.{{sfn|Hansing|2006|p=63}} It is thus most commonly found in the Anglophone Caribbean, United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand, and Anglophone parts of Africa.{{sfn|Hansing|2006|p=64}}\n\n====Jamaica and the Americas====\n[[File:Jamaican Man.jpg|thumb|upright|A Rastafari man in Jamaica.]]\n\nBarrett described Rastafari as \"the largest, most identifiable, indigenous movement in Jamaica.\"{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=viii}} In the mid-1980s, there were approximately 70,000 members and sympathisers of Rastafari in Jamaica.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=16}} The majority of them were male, working-class, former Christians aged between 18 and 40.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=16}} In the 2011 Jamaican census, 29,026 individuals identified as Rastas.<ref name=\"state2007\">{{cite web|url=https://2001-2009.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2007/90259.htm |title=Jamaica |publisher=[[Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor]] (US State Department)|date=September 14, 2007 |accessdate=2010-10-20}}</ref> Jamaica's Rastas were initially entirely from the Afro-Jamaican majority,{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=2}} and although most remain Afro-Jamaican, Rastafari has also gained members from the island's [[Chinese Jamaicans|Chinese]], [[Indo-Jamaicans|Indian]], Afro-Chinese, Afro-Jewish, [[mulatto]], and [[White Jamaican|white]] minorities.{{sfn|Barrett|1997|pp=2\u20133}} Until 1965 the vast majority were from the lower classes, although it has since attracted many middle-class members; by the 1980s there were Jamaican Rastas working as lawyers and university professors.{{sfn|Barrett|1997|pp=2, 241}} Jamaica is often valorised by Rastas as the fountain-head of their faith, and many Rastas living elsewhere travel to the island on [[pilgrimage]].{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=87}}\n\nBoth through travel between the islands,{{sfn|Gjerset|1994|p=67}} and through reggae's popularity,{{sfnm|1a1=Gjerset|1y=1994|1p=67|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=81}} Rastafari spread across the eastern Caribbean during the 1970s. Here, its ideas complemented the anti-colonial and Afrocentric views prevalent in countries like Trinidad, Grenada, Dominica, and St Vincent.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=81}} In these countries, the early Rastas often engaged in cultural and political movements to a greater extent than their Jamaican counterparts had.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=82}} Various Rastas were involved in Grenada's 1979 [[New Jewel Movement]] and were given positions in the Grenadine government until it was overthrown and replaced following the [[Invasion of Grenada|U.S. invasion of 1983]].{{sfnm|1a1=Campbell|1y=1980|1pp=50\u201351|2a1=Simpson|2y=1985|2p=291|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=82}} Although [[Fidel Castro]]'s Marxist\u2013Leninist government generally discouraged foreign influences, Rastafari was introduced to Cuba alongside reggae in the 1970s.{{sfnm|1a1=Hansing|1y=2001|1p=734|2a1=Hansing|2y=2006|2p=65|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3pp=82\u201383}} Foreign Rastas studying in Cuba during the 1990s connected with its reggae scene and helped to further ground it in Rasta beliefs.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=82\u201383}} In Cuba, most Rastas have been male and from the [[Afro-Cuban]] population.{{sfnm|1a1=Hansing|1y=2001|1p=736|2a1=Hansing|2y=2006|2p=69}}\n\nRastafari was introduced to the United States and Canada with the migration of Jamaicans to continental North America in the 1960s and 1970s.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=72}} American police were often suspicious of Rastas and regarded Rastafari as a criminal sub-culture.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=76}} Rastafari also attracted converts from within several Native American communities,{{sfn|Hansing|2001|p=733}} and picked up some support from white members of the [[Hippy]] subculture, which was then in decline.{{sfn|Loadenthal|2013|p=12}} In Latin America, small communities of Rastas have also established in Brazil, Panama, and Nicaragua.{{sfn|Hansing|2006|p=64}}\n\n====Africa====\n\nSome Rastas in the African diaspora have followed through with their beliefs about resettlement in Africa, with Ghana and Nigeria being particularly favoured.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=78}} Caribbean Rastas arrived in Ghana during the 1960s, encouraged by its first post-independence president, [[Kwame Nkrumah]], while some native Ghanaians also converted to the religion.{{sfn|White|2010|pp=304, 306\u2013307}} The largest congregation of Rastas has been in southern parts of Ghana, around [[Accra]], [[Tema]], and the [[Cape Coast]],{{sfn|White|2010|p=314}} although Rasta communities also exist in the Muslim-majority area of northern Ghana.{{sfn|Middleton|2006|p=152}} The Rasta migrants' wearing of dreadlocks was akin to that of the native [[fetish priest]]s, which may have assisted the presentation of these Rastas as having authentic African roots in Ghanaian society.{{sfn|Middleton|2006|pp=154\u2013155}} However, Ghanaian Rastas have complained of social ostracism and prosecution for cannabis possession, while non-Rastas in often consider them to be \"drop-outs\", \"too Western\", and \"not African enough\".{{sfn|Middleton|2006|pp=161\u2013162}} Another West African group to

Rastafari.{{sfn|Savishinsky|1994|p=211}} The popularity of dreadlocks and marijuana among the Baye Faal may have been spread in large part through access to Rasta-influenced reggae in the 1970s.{{sfn|Savishinsky|1994|p=214}} A small community of Rastas also established in Burkina Faso.{{sfn|Wittmann|2011|pp=158\u2013159}}\n\n[[File:East London, Eastern Cape, South Africa

an outlet for the economic hardship, racial discrimination, and social isolation that many faced.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=72}} It spread among the black working-classes not just of London, but also in [[Birmingham]], [[Leicester]], [[Liverpool]], [[Manchester]], and [[Bristol]].{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=58}} Its spread was aided by the [[gang]] structures that had been cultivated among black British youth by the [[rudeboy]] subculture; these gangs proved to be a breeding ground for Rastafari themes.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=56}} British Rastafari gained increasing attention in the 1970s through reggae's popularity,{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1981|1p=176|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=74}} although the police commonly regarded it as a criminal sub-culture.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=74\u201375}} Following

It combines the conquering [[lion of Judah]], symbol of the Ethiopian monarchy, with green, gold, and red.]]\n'''Rastafari''', also known as '''Rastafarianism''', is an [[Abrahamic religion]] that developed in [[Jamaica]] during the 1930s. It is classified as both a [[new religious movement]] and a [[social movement]] by [[Religious studies|scholars of religion]]. There is no central authority in control of the movement and much diversity exists among practitioners, who are known as Rastafari, Rastafarians, or Rastas.\n\nRasta beliefs are based on a specific interpretation of the [[Bible]]. Central is a [[monotheistic]] belief in a single God, referred to as [[Jah]], who partially resides within each individual. Rastafari also maintains that Jah incarnated in human form as [[Jesus of Nazareth|Jesus Christ]]. Rastas accord [[Haile Selassie]], the [[Emperor of Ethiopia]] between 1930 and 1974, central importance; many regard him as the [[Second Coming of Christ]] and thus Jah incarnate, while others see him as a human prophet who fully recognized the inner divinity in every individual. Rastafari is [[Afrocentrism|Afrocentric]] and focuses attention on the [[African diaspora]], which it believes is oppressed within Western society, or \"Babylon\". Many Rastas call for this diaspora's resettlement in Africa, a continent they consider the [[Promised Land]] of \"Zion\". Some practitioners extend these views into [[Black supremacy|black supremacism]]. Rastas refer to their practices as \"[[Livity (spiritual concept)|livity]]\". Communal meetings are known as \"groundations\", and are typified by music, chanting, discussions, and the [[Entheogenic use of cannabis|smoking of cannabis]], the latter regarded as a [[sacrament]] with beneficial properties. Rastas emphasise what they regard as living \"naturally\", adhering to [[ital]] dietary requirements, twisting their hair into [[dreadlocks]], and following [[patriarchy|patriarchal]] gender roles.\n\nRastafari originated among impoverished and socially disenfranchised [[Afro-Jamaican]] communities in 1930s Jamaica. Its Afrocentric ideology was largely a reaction against Jamaica's then-dominant [[Colony of Jamaica|British colonial culture]]. It was influenced by both [[Ethiopian movement|Ethiopianism]] and the [[Back-to-Africa movement]] promoted by [[black nationalism|black nationalist]] figures such as [[Marcus Garvey]]. The movement developed after several [[Protestantism|Protestant]] [[Christianity|Christian]] clergymen, most notably [[Leonard Howell]], proclaimed that Haile Selassie's crowning as Emperor of Ethiopia in 1930 fulfilled a Biblical prophecy. By the 1950s, Rastafari's [[counter-culture|counter-cultural]] stance had brought the movement into conflict with wider Jamaican society, including violent clashes with law enforcement. In the 1960s and 1970s it gained increased respectability within Jamaica and greater visibility abroad through the popularity of Rasta-inspired [[reggae]] musicians, most notably [[Bob Marley]]. Enthusiasm for Rastafari declined in the 1980s, following the deaths of Haile Selassie and Marley, but the movement survived and has a presence in many parts of the world.\n\nThe Rasta movement is decentralised and organised on a largely cellular basis. There are several denominations, or \"[[Mansions of Rastafari]]\", the most prominent of which are the [[Nyahbinghi]], [[Bobo Ashanti]], and the [[Twelve Tribes of Israel (Rastafari)|Twelve Tribes of Israel]], each offering a different interpretation of Rasta belief. There are an estimated 700,000 to 1 million Rastas across the world. The largest population is in Jamaica, although communities can be found in most of the world's major population centres. Rastas come from various ethnic groups although the majority are of black African descent and some Mansions only accept black members.\n\n==Definition==\n\nRastafari has been described as a religion,{{sfnm|1a1=Gjerset|1y=1994|1p=75, 76|2a1=Loadenthal|2y=2013|2p=3}} meeting many of the proposed definitions for what constitutes a religion,{{sfn|Chawane|2014|p=216}} and is legally recognised as such in various countries.{{sfn|Mhango|2008|pp=223, 225\u2013226}} [[Religious studies|Scholars of religion]] have categorised Rastafari as a [[new religious movement]].{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=11|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=92|3a1=Sibanda|3y=2016|3p=182}} Others have proposed additional classifications: Leonard E. Barrett referred to it as a [[sect]],{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=viii}} while [[Sheila Kitzinger]] and Ernest Cashmore called it a [[cult]],{{sfnm|1a1=Kitzinger|1y=1969|1p=240|2a1=Cashmore|2y=1983|2p=6}} and Ennis B. Edmonds argued that it could best be understood as a [[revitalization movement]].{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=92}} Edmonds also suggested that Rastafari was \"emerging\" as a [[world religion]], not because of the number of adherents that it had, but because of its global spread.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=71\u201372}} Although Rastafari focuses on Africa as a source of identity, Maboula Soumahoro noted that it was not an \"authentic\" African religion but an example of [[creolization]], a product of the unique social environment that existed in the Americas.{{sfn|Soumahoro|2007|p=43}} Katrin Hansing described it as \"one of the leading Afro-Caribbean religions\".{{sfnm|1a1=Hansing|1y=2001|1p=733|2a1=Hansing|2y=2006|2p=62}} Many Rastas nevertheless dislike the notion that Rastafari should be called a religion, instead referring to it as a \"way of life\",{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1p=188|2a1=Bedasse|2y=2010|2p=267|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=92|4a1=Glazier|4y=2012|4p=614|5a1=Chawane|5y=2014|5p=214}} a \"[[philosophy]]\",{{sfn|Loadenthal|2013|p=6}} or as a \"[[spirituality]]\".{{sfn|Chawane|2014|p=214}}\n\n[[File:Street vendors in Zeerust.jpg|thumb|left|Two Rasta street vendors in [[Zeerust]], [[South Africa]]; they are wearing and selling items that display their commitment to the religion]]\n\nOther scholars have categorized it in different ways.

the term \"Ethiopia\" synonymously with \"Africa\".{{sfnm|1a1=Kitzinger|1y=1969|1p=240|2a1=Middleton|2y=2006|2p=163}} Other Rastas apply the term \"Zion\" to Jamaica or use it to describe a state of mind.{{sfn|Barnett|2005|p=77}} In placing emphasis on Africa as the Promised Land, Rastas reflect their desire to escape what they perceive as the domination and degradation that they experience in Babylon.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=41}} During the first three decades of the Rastafari movement, it placed strong emphasis on the need for the African diaspora to be repatriated to Africa.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=41}} To this end, various Rastas lobbied the Jamaican government and [[United Nations]] to oversee this resettlement process.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=41}} Other Rastas organised their own transportation to the African continent.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=41}} Critics of the movement have argued that the migration of the entire African diaspora to Africa is implausible, particularly as no African country would welcome this.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=127}}\n\nBy the movement's fourth decade, the desire for physical repatriation to Africa had declined among Rastas.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=42}} This change was influenced by observation of the [[1983\u20131985 famine in Ethiopia]].{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=99}} Rather, many Rastas saw the idea of returning to Africa in a metaphorical sense, entailing restoring their pride and self-confidence as people of black African descent.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=100|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=42|3a1=Bedasse|3y=2013|3p=294}}

may more comfortably live within it rather than seeking to move to Africa.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=85}} There are nevertheless many Rastas who continue to emphasise the need for physical resettlement of the African diaspora in Africa.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=42}} Some Rastas living elsewhere in Africa see no need to migrate to Ethiopia specifically because they believe that all of Africa falls under the Biblical understanding of \"Ethiopia\"; thus, Rastas in Ghana for instance described themselves as already living within \"Ethiopia\".{{sfn|Middleton|2006|p=163}}\n\n====Salvation and

that the world's white people would wipe themselves out through [[nuclear war]],{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=119}} with black Africans then ruling the world, something that they argue is prophesied in the [[Book of Daniel]] (2:31\u201332).{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=119}}\n\nRastas do not believe that there is a specific [[afterlife]] to which human individuals go following bodily

Jah.{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=112}} He suggested that this attitude stemmed from the large numbers of young people that were then members of the movement, and who had thus seen only few Rastas die.{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=113}} In keeping with their views on death, Rastas eschew celebrating physical death and often avoid

endorses the idea that Africa is the \"natural\" abode of black Africans, a continent where they can live according to African culture and tradition and be themselves on a physical, emotional, and intellectual level.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=82}} Practitioners believe that Westerners and Babylon have detached themselves from nature through technological development and thus have become debilitated, slothful, and decadent.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=83|2a1=Barnett|2y=2002|2p=57}} Some Rastas express the view that they should adhere to what they regard as African laws rather than the laws of Babylon, thus defending their involvement in certain acts which may be illegal in the countries that they are living in.{{sfn|Cashmore|1981|p=177}} In emphasising his Afrocentric approach, Rastafari expresses overtones of [[black nationalism]].{{sfn|Watson|1973|p=192}}\n\nMaureen Warner-Lewis observed that Rastafari combined a \"radical, even revolutionary\" stance on socio-political issues, particularly regarding race, with a \"profoundly traditional\" approach to \"philosophical conservatism\" on other religious issues.{{sfn|Warner-Lewis|1993|p=122}} Rastas typically look critically upon modern capitalism with its consumerism and materialism.{{sfn|Barnett|2002|p=54}} They favour small-scale, pre-industrial and agricultural societies.{{sfn|Barnett|2002|p=57}} Some Rastas have promoted activism as a means of achieving socio-political change, while others believe in awaiting change that will be brought about through divine intervention in human affairs.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=50}} In Jamaica, Rastas typically do not vote,{{sfnm|1a1=Kitzinger|1y=1969|1p=247|2a1=Chevannes|2y=1994|2p=150|3a1=Barrett|3y=1997|3p=220}} derogatorily dismissing politics as \"politricks\".{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=220}} The Rasta tendency to believe that socio-political change is inevitable opens the religion up to the criticism from the [[Left-wing politics|political left]] that it encouraged adherents to do little or nothing to change the status quo.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1981|1pp=175\u2013176, 179|2a1=Barnett|2y=2006|2p=891}} Other Rastas do engage in political activism; the Ghanaian Rasta singer-songwriter [[Rocky Dawuni]] for instance was involved in campaigns promoting democratic elections,{{sfn|Middleton|2006|pp=165\u2013167}} while in [[Grenada]], many

men.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=85}} Rastafari women usually accept this subordinate position and regard it as their duty to obey their men;{{sfn|Cashmore|1981|p=178}} the academic Maureen Rowe suggested that women were willing to join the religion despite its restrictions because they valued the life of structure and discipline it provided.{{sfn|Rowe|1980|p=16}} Rasta discourse often presents women as morally weak and susceptible to deception by [[evil]],{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=97}} and claims that they are impure while [[menstruation|menstruating]].{{sfnm|1a1=Rowe|1y=1980|1p=15|2a1=Lake|2y=1994|2p=244|3a1=Sabelli|3y=2011|3p=141|4a1=Edmonds|4y=2012|4p=98}} Rastas legitimise these gender roles by citing Biblical

in favour of long skirts;{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=98}} women are expected to cover their head while praying,{{sfn|Rowe|1980|p=15}} and in some Rasta groups this is expected of them whenever in public.{{sfn|Barnett|2006|p=889}} Rasta discourse insists this female dress code is necessary to prevent women attracting men and presents it as an antidote to the [[sexual objectification]] of women in Babylon.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=98, 99}} Rasta men are permitted to wear whatever they choose.{{sfnm|1a1=Barnett|1y=2002|1p=55|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=98}} Although men and women took part in early Rasta rituals alongside each other, from the late 1940s and 1950s a more radical movement within the Rasta community encouraged gender segregation for ceremonies.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=95}} This was legitimised with the explanation that women were impure through menstruation and that their presence at the ceremonies would distract male participants.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=95}}\n\nAs it existed in Jamaica, Rastafari did not promote monogamy.{{sfn|Kitzinger|1966|p=38}} Rasta men are permitted multiple female sex partners,{{sfnm|1a1=Lake|1y=1994|1p=252|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=99}} while women are expected to reserve their sexual activity for their one male partner.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=99}} Marriage is not usually formalised through legal ceremonies but is a [[common law marriage|common law]]

relationships are known as \"kingmen\".{{sfnm|1a1=Lake|1y=1994|1p=245|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=99}} Rastafari places great importance on family life and the raising of children,{{sfn|Clarke|1986|pp=87\u201388}} with reproduction being encouraged.{{sfn|Kitzinger|1966|p=37}} The religion emphasises the place of men in child-rearing, associating this with the recovery of African manhood.{{sfnm|1a1=Kebede|1a2=Knottnerus|1y=1998|1p=504|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2pp=103\u2013104}} Women often work, sometimes while the man is left to raise the children at

By the 8th century, Arab traders had introduced cannabis to Central and Southern Africa.{{sfn|Hamid|2002|p=xxxii}} In the 19th century, enslaved [[Kongo people|Bakongo]] people arrived in Jamaica, where they established the religion of [[Kumina]]. In Kumina, cannabis was smoked during religious ceremonies in the belief that it facilitated possession by ancestral spirits.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=55}} The religion was largely practiced in south-east Jamaica's [[Saint Thomas Parish, Jamaica|Saint Thomas Parish]], where a prominent early Rasta, [[Leonard Howell]], lived while he was developing many of Rastafari's beliefs and practices; it may have been through Kumina that cannabis became part of Rastafari.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=55}} A second possible source was the use of cannabis in [[Hinduism|Hindu]] rituals.{{sfnm|1a1=Benard|1y=2007|1p=95, 96|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=55}} Hindu migrants arrived in Jamaica as indentured servants from [[British India]] between 1834 and 1917, and brought cannabis with them.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=55}} A Jamaican Hindu priest, Laloo, was one of Howell's spiritual advisors, and may have influenced his adoption of ganja.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=55}}\n\nThe adoption of cannabis may also have been influenced by the widespread medicinal and recreational use of cannabis among Afro-Jamaicans in the early 20th century.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=55}} Early Rastafarians may have taken an element of Jamaican culture which they associated with their peasant past and the rejection of capitalism and sanctified it by according it Biblical correlates.{{sfn|Benard|2007|pp=91\u201392}} In many countries, cannabis is illegal and by using it, Rastas protest the rules and regulations of Babylon;{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=129}} in the United States, for example, thousands of practitioners have been arrested because of their possession of the drug.{{sfn|Loadenthal|2013|p=5}}  Rastas have also advocated for the legalisation of cannabis in those jurisdictions where it is illegal.{{sfnm|1a1=Barnett|1y=2005|1p=76|2a1=Barnett|2y=2006|2p=892|3a1=Sibanda|3y=2016|3p=184}} In November 2019, the government of [[Barbados]] passed legislation allowing for Rastafarians to use cannabis for religious reasons, provided that groups first follow certain provisions.<ref>{{cite news |last= |first= |date=24 November 2019 |title=Government passes ganja legislation for Rastafarians, conditions apply |url=http://www.loopnewsbarbados.com/content/rastas-get-ganja-permission-conditions# |work=Loop |access-date=19 February 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Music===\n[[File:RastaBongo.jpg|thumb|right|A Rasta using a bongo drum]]\nRastafari music developed at reasoning sessions,{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=93}} where drumming, chanting, and dancing are all present.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=58}} Rasta music is performed to praise and commune with Jah,{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=94}} and to reaffirm the rejection of Babylon.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=94}} Rastas believe that their music has healing properties, with the ability to cure colds, fevers, and headaches.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=94}} Many of these songs are sung to the tune of older Christian hymns,{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=94|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=123|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=58}} but others are original Rasta creations.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=94}}\n\nThe bass-line of Rasta music is provided by the [[akete]], a three-drum set, which is accompanied by [[percussion instruments]] like [[rattle (percussion instrument)|rattle]]s and [[tambourine]]s.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=58}} A syncopated rhythm is then provided by the [[fundeh]] drum.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=58}} In addition, a [[peta (drum)|peta]] drum improvises over the rhythm.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=58}} The different components of the music are regarded as displaying different symbolism; the bassline symbolises blows against Babylon, while the lighter beats denote hope for the future.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=58}}\n\nAs Rastafari developed, popular music became its chief communicative medium.{{sfn|King|2002|p=5}} During the 1950s, [[ska]] was a popular musical style in Jamaica, and although its protests against social and political conditions were mild, it gave early expression to Rasta socio-political ideology.{{sfn|King|2002|p=4}} Particularly prominent in the connection between Rastafari and ska were the musicians [[Count Ossie]] and [[Don Drummond]].{{sfnm|1a1=King|1y=2002|1p=24|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=115}} Ossie was a drummer who believed that black people needed to develop their own style of music;{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=93|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=162}} he was heavily influenced by [[Kumina]] and [[Burru]], two drumming styles developed by African-Jamaicans.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=113}} Ossie subsequently popularised this new Rastafari ritual music by playing at various groundings and groundations around Jamaica,{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=113}} with songs like \"Another Moses\" and \"Babylon Gone\" reflecting Rasta influence.{{sfn|King|2002|p=24}} Rasta themes also appeared in Drummond's work, with songs such as \"Reincarnation\" and \"Tribute to Marcus Garvey\".{{sfn|King|2002|p=24}}\n\n1968 saw the development of [[reggae]] in Jamaica, a musical style typified by slower, heavier rhythms than ska and the increased use of [[patois]].{{sfn|King|2002|p=46}} Although like [[calypso music|calypso]], reggae was a medium for [[social commentary]],{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=vii}} it demonstrated a wider use of radical political and Rasta themes than were previously present in Jamaican popular music.{{sfn|King|2002|p=46}} Reggae artists incorporated Rasta ritual rhythms,{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=117}} and also adopted Rasta chants, language, motifs, and social critiques.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=117}} Songs like [[The Wailers]]' \"[[African Herbsman]]\" and [[Peter Tosh]]'s \"Legalize It\" referenced cannabis use,{{sfn|King|2002|p=57}} while tracks like [[The Melodians]]' \"[[Rivers of Babylon]]\" and [[Junior Byles]]' \"Beat Down Babylon\" referenced Rasta beliefs in Babylon.{{sfn|King|2002|p=56}} Reggae gained widespread international popularity during the mid-1970s,{{sfn|King|2002|p=96}} coming to be viewed as music of the oppressed by black people in many different countries.{{sfn|King|2002|p=100}} Many Rastas grew critical of reggae, believing that it had commercialised their religion.{{sfn|King|2002|p=102}} Although reggae contains much Rastafari symbolism,{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=viii}} and the two are widely associated,{{sfn|King|2002|p=xiii}} the connection is often exaggerated by non-Rastas.{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=245}} Most Rastas do not listen to reggae music,{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=245}} and reggae has also been utilised by other religious groups, such as evangelical Protestants.{{sfn|Rommen|2006|pp=235\u2013236}} Out of reggae came [[dub music]];

it has been adopted from the [[Flag of Jamaica|Jamaican flag]],{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=143}} and is often interpreted as symbolising the minerals and raw materials which constitute Africa's wealth.{{sfn|White|2010|p=307}} Rastas often paint these colours onto their buildings, vehicles, kiosks, and other items,{{sfn|White|2010|p=308}} or display them on their clothing, helping to demarcate Rastas from non-Rastas and allowing adherents to recognise their co-religionists.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=160}} As well as being used by Rastas, the colour set has also been adopted by Pan-Africanists more broadly, who use it to display their identification with Afrocentricity;{{sfn|White|2010|p=307}} for this reason it was adopted on the flags of many post-independence African states.{{sfn|White|2010|p=308}} Rastas often accompany the use of these three or four colours with the image of the [[Lion of Judah]], also adopted from the Ethiopian flag and symbolizing Haile Selassie.{{sfn|White|2010|p=308}}\n\n===Diet===\n{{Main|Ital}}\n\n[[File:Ital food - 01.jpg|thumb|right|An ital breakfast;

Here, they were sold to European planters and forced to work on the plantations.{{sfn|Chevannes|1994|p=2}} Around a third of these transported Africans were relocated in the Caribbean, with under 700,000 being settled in Jamaica.{{sfn|Chevannes|1994|p=2}} In 1834, slavery in Jamaica was abolished after the British government passed the [[Slavery Abolition Act 1833]].{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=24|2a1=Chevannes|2y=1994|2p=3}} Racial prejudice nevertheless remained prevalent across Jamaican society,{{sfn|Chevannes|1994|p=3}} with the overwhelming majority of Jamaica's legislative council remaining white throughout the nineteenth century,{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=25}} and those of African descent being treated as [[second-class citizen]]s.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=24}}\n\nChristian Revivalism was a key influence on Rastafari.{{sfn|Chevannes|1994|p=120}} Many Afro-Jamaicans joined Christian churches during the Great Revival of 1860\u201361.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=25|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=21}} They brought with them many inherited African beliefs and rituals, which syncretised with Christianity in various ways and to varying degrees.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=25}} Some of the new religions that emerged, such as Pukkumina, remained heavily based on traditional African religion, while others, like Revival Zion, were more fully Christian.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=25|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=22}} The majority of these groups practiced spiritual healing and incorporated drumming and chanting, counselling, and spirit possession into their structures.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=26}} Increasing numbers of [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]] missionaries from the United States arrived in Jamaica during the early twentieth century, reaching a climax in the 1920s.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=26|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=25}} They provided a way for black Jamaicans\u2014who continued to live with the social memory of enslavement and who were denied any substantial participation in Jamaica's political institutions\u2014to express their hopes, fears, and aspirations.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=26}}\n\n===Ethiopianism, Back to Africa, and Marcus Garvey===\n\n[[File:Marcus Garvey 1924-08-05.jpg|thumb|upright|Marcus Garvey, a prominent black nationalist theorist who heavily influenced Rastafari and is regarded as a prophet by many Rastas]]\nAccording to Edmonds, Rastafari emerged from \"the convergence of several religious, cultural, and intellectual streams\",{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=7}} while fellow scholar Wigmoore Francis described it as owing much of its self-understanding to \"intellectual and conceptual frameworks\" dating from the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.{{sfn|Francis|2013|p=52}} Both [[Ethiopianism]] and the [[Back to Africa]] ethos remain \"fundamental ingredients of Rastafarian ideology\".{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=27}} These two movements predated Rastafari and can be traced back to the eighteenth century.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|pp=27\u201328}}\n\nIn the nineteenth century, there were growing calls for the African diaspora located in Western Europe and the Americas to be resettled in Africa.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|pp=27\u201328}} In that century, many members of the African diaspora were moved to Sierra Leone and Liberia.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|pp=27\u201328}} Based in Liberia, the black Christian preacher [[Edward Wilmot Blyden]] began promoting African pride and the preservation of African tradition, customs, and institutions.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1pp=29\u201334|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2pp=75\u201376|3a1=Francis|3y=2013|3pp=54\u201356}} Blyden sought to promote a form of Christianity that was suited to the African context,{{sfn|Clarke|1986|pp=32\u201333}} and believed that black people had to acquire their own historical knowledge about themselves.{{sfn|Francis|2013|p=66}} The idea of the African diaspora's return to Africa was given impetus by the creation of the [[Israel|State of Israel]] in 1948 as a nation-state for the [[Jewish diaspora]] to return to.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=18}}\n\nAlso spreading through Africa was Ethiopianism, a movement that accorded special status to the east African nation of Ethiopia because it was mentioned in various Biblical passages.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=34|2a1=Chawane|2y=2014|2p=221}} For adherents of Ethiopianism, \"Ethiopia\" was regarded as a synonym of Africa as a whole.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=34}} Across the continent, although particularly in South Africa, Christian churches were established that referred to themselves as \"Ethiopian\"; these groups were at the forefront of the burgeoning African nationalist movement that sought liberation from European colonial rule.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|pp=34\u201335}}\n\nOf significant influence on Rastafari was the Jamaican-born activist Marcus Garvey, who spent much of his adult life in the United States and United Kingdom.

charisma|routinization]],{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=146}} with the late 1960s witnessing the launch of the first official Rastafarian newspaper, the [[Rastafarian Movement Association]]'s ''Rasta Voice''.{{sfn|King|2002|p=52}} The decade also saw Rastafari develop in increasingly complex ways.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=51}} During that decade, some Rastas began to reinterpret the idea that salvation required a physical return to Africa, instead interpreting salvation as coming through a process of mental decolonisation that embraced African approaches to life.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=51}}\n\nWhereas its membership had previously come predominantly from poorer sectors of Jamaican society, in the 1960s Rastafari began to attract support from more privileged groups like students and professional musicians.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=51|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=25}} The foremost group emphasising this approach were the Twelve Tribes of Israel, whose members came to be known as \"Uptown Rastas\".{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=25}} Among those attracted to Rastafari in this decade were middle-class intellectuals like [[Leahcim Semaj]], who called for the religious community to place greater emphasis on scholarly social theory as a method of achieving change.{{sfn|King|2002|p=103}} Although some Jamaican Rastas were critical of him,{{sfn|King|2002|p=81}} many came under the influence of the Guyanese black nationalist academic [[Walter Rodney]], who lectured to their community in 1968 before publishing his thoughts as the pamphlet ''Groundings''.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=52|2a1=Bedasse|2y=2013|2pp=297-298|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=26}} Like Rodney, many Jamaican Rastas were influenced by the U.S.-based [[Black Power]] movement.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=54|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2pp=25\u201326}} After Black Power declined following the deaths of prominent exponents such as [[Malcolm X]], [[Michael X]], and [[George Jackson (activist)|George Jackson]], Rastafari filled the vacuum it left for many black youth.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=55}}\n\n===International spread and decline: 1970\u2013present===\n[[File:Rasta vendor with hat and glass Obama mug Inauguration 2013.jpg|thumb|upright|A Rasta vendor plies his wares in the U.S. city of [[Washington D.C.]] in 2013]]\n\nIn the mid-1970s, reggae's international popularity exploded.{{sfn|King|2002|p=96}} The most successful reggae artist was Bob Marley, who\u2014according to Cashmore\u2014\"more than any other individual, was responsible for introducing Rastafarian themes, concepts and demands to a truly universal audience\".{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=108}} Reggae's popularity led to a growth in \"pseudo-Rastafarians\", individuals who listened to reggae and wore Rasta clothing but did not share its belief system.{{sfn|King|2002|pp=100, 102}} Many Rastas were angered by this, believing it commercialised their religion.{{sfn|King|2002|p=102}}\n\nThrough reggae, Rasta musicians became increasingly important in Jamaica's political life during the 1970s.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=53}} In his desire to move towards [[democratic socialism]], Jamaican Prime Minister [[Michael Manley]] employed some Rasta imagery, and also courted and obtained support from Marley and other reggae musicians, thus helping to bolster his popularity with the electorate.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=52|2a1=Lewis|2y=1993|2p=12|3a1=Lewis|3y=1994|3pp=290\u2013291|4a1=King|4y=2002|4pp=105, 108\u2013111}} Manley described Rastas as a \"beautiful and remarkable people\",{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=ix}} and carried a cane, the \"rod of correction\", which he claimed was a gift from Haile Selassie.{{sfnm|1a1=Barrett|1y=1997|1p=220|2a1=King|2y=1998|2p=41|3a1=King|3y=2002|3pp=91\u201392|4a1=Edmonds|4y=2012|4p=27}} Following Manley's example, Jamaican political groups increasingly employed Rasta language, symbols, and reggae references in their campaigns,{{sfnm|1a1=Lewis|1y=1994|1p=12|2a1=Lewis|2y=1994|2p=291|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=27}} while Rasta symbols became increasingly mainstream in Jamaican society.{{sfn|King|2002|p=106}} This helped to confer greater legitimacy on Rastafari,{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=27}} with reggae and Rasta imagery being increasingly presented as a core part of Jamaica's [[cultural heritage]] for the marketing purposes of the growing tourist industry.{{sfn|King|2002|pp=121\u2013122}}\n\nEnthusiasm for Rastafari was likely dampened by the death of Haile Selassie in 1975 and that of Marley in 1981.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=28}} During the 1980s, the number of Rastas in Jamaica declined,{{sfn|King|2002|p=120}} with Pentecostal and other Charismatic Christian groups proving more successful at attracting young recruits.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=29}} Several publicly prominent Rastas converted to Christianity,{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=29}} and two of those who did so\u2014[[Judy Mowatt]] and [[Tommy Cowan]]\u2014maintained that Marley had converted from Rastafari to Christianity, in the form of the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Church]], during his final days.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=29\u201330}} The significance of Rastafari messages in reggae also declined with the growing popularity of [[dancehall]], a Jamaican musical genre that typically foregrounded lyrical themes of hyper-masculinity, violence, and sexual activity rather than religious symbolism.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=30}} However, in the 1980s, a Rasta practitioner, [[Barbara Makeda Blake Hannah]], was appointed a Senator in the Jamaican Parliament.{{sfn|Semaj|2013|p=98}}\n\nThe mid-1990s saw a revival of Rastafari-focused reggae associated with musicians like [[Anthony B]], [[Buju Banton]], [[Luciano]], [[Sizzla]], and [[Capleton]].{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=30}} From the 1990s, Jamaica also witnessed the growth of organised political activity within the Rasta community, seen for instance through campaigns for the legalisation of marijuana and the creation of political parties like the [[Jamaican Alliance Movement]] and the [[Imperial Ethiopian World Federation Incorporated Political Party]], none of which attained more than minimal electoral support.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=30\u201331}} In 1995, the Rastafari Centralization Organization was established in Jamaica as an attempt to organise the Rastafari community.{{sfn|Barnett|2002|p=56}}\n\n==Organization==\n\nRastafari is not a homogeneous movement and has no single administrative structure,{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=52}} nor any single leader.{{sfnm|1a1=Barrett|1y=1997|1p=91|2a1=King|2y=2002|2p=xvii}} Rastas avoid centralised and hierarchical structures because they do not want to replicate the structures of Babylon and because their religion's ultra-individualistic ethos places emphasis on inner divinity.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=52\u201353}} The structure of Rastafari groups is less like those of Christian denominations and is instead akin to the cellular structure of other African diasporic traditions like [[Haitian Vodou]], Cuban [[Santer\u00eda]], and Jamaica's [[Revival Zion]].{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=52}} Since the 1970s, there have been attempts to unify all Rastas, namely through the establishment of the [[Rastafari Movement Association]], which sought political mobilisation.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=69}} In 1982, the first international assembly of Rastafari groups took place in [[Toronto]], Canada.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=69}} This and subsequent international conferences, assemblies, and workshops have helped to cement global networks and cultivate an international community of Rasta practitioners.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=88\u201389}}\n\n===Mansions of Rastafari===\n\n{{Main|Mansions of Rastafari}}\n\n[[File:ReggaeV4.0.png|thumb|right|A stylized Rastafari motif, depicting the [[Lion of Judah]]]]\n\nSub-divisions of Rastafari are often referred to as \"houses\" or \"mansions\", in keeping with a passage from the [[Gospel of John]] (14:2): as translated in the [[King James Bible]], Jesus states \"In my father's house are many mansions\".{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=62}} The three most prominent branches are the House of Nyabinghi, the Bobo Ashanti, and the Twelve Tribes of Israel, although other important groups include the Church of Haile Selassie I, Inc., and the Fulfilled Rastafari.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=62}}\n\nProbably the largest Rastafari group, the [[Nyabinghi|House of Nyabinghi]] is an aggregate of more traditional and militant Rastas who seek to retain the movement close to the way in which it existed during the 1940s.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=62}} They stress the idea that Haile Selassie was Jah and the reincarnation of Jesus.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=62}} The wearing of dreadlocks is regarded as indispensable and patriarchal gender roles are strongly emphasised,{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=62}} while, according to Cashmore, they are  \"vehemently anti-white\".{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=25}} Nyabinghi Rastas refuse to compromise with Babylon, and are often critical of reggae musicians like Marley, whom they regard as having collaborated with the commercial music industry.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=59, 62}}\n\nThe [[Bobo Ashanti]] sect was founded in Jamaica by [[Charles Edwards (Rastafarian)|Emanuel Charles Edwards]] through the establishment of his Ethiopia Africa Black International Congress (EABIC) in 1958.{{sfnm|1a1=Edmonds|1y=2012|1p=63|2a1=Merritt|2y=2017|2p=285}} The group established a commune in [[Bull Bay]], where they were led by Edwards until his 1994 death.{{sfnm|1a1=Edmonds|1y=2012|1p=64|2a1=Merritt|2y=2017|2pp=285\u2013286}} The group hold to a highly rigid ethos.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=64}} Edwards advocated the idea of a new trinity, with Haile Selassie as the living God, himself as the Christ, and Garvey as the prophet.{{sfnm|1a1=Barrett|1y=1997|1p=182|2a1=Barnett|2y=2005|2p=69|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=64}} Male members are divided into two categories: the \"priests\" who conduct religious services and the \"prophets\" who take place in reasoning sessions.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=64}} It places greater restrictions on women than most other forms of Rastafari;{{sfn|Barnett|2005|p=69}} women are regarded as impure because of menstruation and childbirth, and so are not permitted to cook for men.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=64}} The group teaches that black Africans are God's chosen people and are superior to white Europeans,{{sfnm|1a1=Barnett|1y=2005|1p=69|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=64}} with members often refusing to associate with white people.{{sfn|Middleton|2006|p=157}} Bobo Ashanti Rastas are recognisable by their long, flowing robes and turbans.{{sfnm|1a1=Lake|1y=1994|1p=247|2a1=Barnett|2y=2005|2p=69|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=64}}\n\n[[File:Twelve Tribes of Israel headquarters.jpg|thumb|left|The headquarters of the Twelve Tribes of Israel organisation in Shashamane, Ethiopia]]\n\nThe [[Twelve Tribes of Israel (Rastafari)|Twelve Tribes of Israel]] sect was founded in 1968 in Kingston by [[Vernon Carrington]].{{sfnm|1a1=Lewis|1y=1993|1p=11|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=227|3a1=Bedasse|3y=2010|3pp=961, 962|4a1=Edmonds|4y=2012|4p=64}} He proclaimed himself the reincarnation of the Old Testament prophet [[Gad (son of Jacob)|Gad]] and his followers call him \"Prophet Gad\", \"Brother Gad\", or \"Gadman\".{{sfnm|1a1=Rubenstein|1a2=Suarez|1y=1994|1p=2|2a1=Bedasse|2y=2010|2p=962|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=64}} It is commonly regarded as the most liberal form of Rastafari and the closest to Christianity;{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=36}} some Rastas regard it as being heretical.{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=323}} Practitioners are often dubbed \"Christian Rastas\" because they believe Jesus is the only saviour; Haile Selassie is accorded importance, but is not viewed as the second coming of Jesus.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=67}} The group divides its members into twelve groups according to which [[Hebrew calendar]] month they were born; each month is associated with a particular colour, body part, and mental function.{{sfnm|1a1=Barrett|1y=1997|1p=229|2a1=Barnett|2y=2005|2p=68|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=65}} Maintaining dreadlocks and an ital diet are considered commendable but not essential,{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=66\u201367}} while adherents are called upon to read a chapter of the Bible each day.{{sfnm|1a1=Edmonds|1y=2012|1p=68|2a1=Barnett|2y=2005|2p=67|3a1=Bedasse|3y=2013|3p=302}} Membership is open to individuals of any racial background.{{sfn|Barnett|2005|p=68}}\n\nThe Twelve Tribes peaked in popularity during the 1970s, when it attracted artists, musicians, and many middle-class followers, resulting in the term \"middle-class Rastas\" and \"uptown Rastas\" being applied to members of the group.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=68}} Marley was one such of these musicians belonging to the Twelve Tribes.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1p=54|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=230}} Carrington died in 2005, since which time the Twelve Tribes of Israel have been led by an executive council.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=68}} As of 2010, it was recorded as being the largest of the centralized Rasta groups.{{sfn|Bedasse|2010|p=961}} It remains headquartered in Kingston, although has followers outside Jamaica;{{sfn|Bedasse|2010|pp=961\u2013962}} it was responsible for establishing the Rasta community in Shashame, Ethiopia.{{sfnm|1a1=Lewis|1y=1993|1p=11|2a1=Rubenstein|2a2=Suarez|2y=1994|2p=4}}\n\nThe Church of Haile Selassie, Inc was founded by Abuna Foxe, and operated much like a mainstream Christian church, with a hierarchy of functionaries, weekly services, and [[Sunday schools]].{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=68\u201369}} In adopting this broad approach, the Church seeks to develop Rastafari's respectability in wider society.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=69}} Fulfilled Rastafari is a multi-ethnic movement that has spread in popularity during the twenty-first century, in large part through the [[Internet]].{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=69}} The Fulfilled Rastafari group accept Haile Selassie's statements that he was a man and that he was a devout Christian, and so place emphasis on worshipping Jesus through the example set forth by Haile Selassie.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=69}} The wearing of dreadlocks and the adherence to an ital diet are considered issues up to the individual.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=69}}\n\n==Demographics==\n\n{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote=Born in the ghettos of Kingston, Jamaica, the Rastafarian movement has captured the imagination of thousands of black youth, and some white youth, throughout Jamaica, the Caribbean, Britain, France, and other countries in Western Europe and North America. It is also to be found in smaller numbers in parts of Africa\u2014for example, in Ethiopia, Ghana, and Senegal\u2014and in Australia and New Zealand, particularly among the Maori.|source=\u2014 Sociologist of religion [[Peter B. Clarke]], 1986{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=17}} }}\n\nAs of 2012, there were an estimated 700,000 to 1 million Rastas worldwide.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=71}} They can be found in many different regions, including most of the world's major population centers.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=71}} Rastafari's influence on wider society has been more substantial than its numerical size,{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=14|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=71}} particularly in fostering a racial, political, and cultural consciousness among the African diaspora, Africans themselves, and other dominated communities across the world.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=71}} Men dominate Rastafari.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=94}} In its early years, most of its followers were men, and the women who did adhere to it tended to remain in the background.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=94}} This picture of Rastafari's demographics has been confirmed by ethnographic studies conducted in the late twentieth and twenty-first centuries.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=94\u201395}}\n\nThe Rasta message resonates with many people who feel marginalised and alienated by the values and institutions of their society.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=89}} Internationally, it has proved most popular among the poor and among marginalised youth.{{sfn|Hansing|2006|p=63}} In valorising Africa and blackness, Rastafari provides a positive identity for youth in the African diaspora by allowing them to psychologically reject their social stigmatisation.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=89}} It then provides these disaffected people with the discursive stance from which they can challenge capitalism and consumerism, providing them with symbols of resistance and defiance.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=89}} Cashmore expressed the view that \"whenever there are black people who sense an injust disparity between their own material conditions and those of the whites who surround them and tend to control major social institutions, the Rasta messages have relevance.\"{{sfn|Cashmore|1984|p=3}}\n\n===Conversion and deconversion===\n\nRastafari is a non-missionary religion.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=85}} However, elders from Jamaica often go \"trodding\" to instruct new converts in the fundamentals of the religion.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=85}} On researching English Rastas during the 1970s, Cashmore noted that they had not [[religious conversion|converted]] instantaneously, but rather had undergone \"a process of drift\" through which they gradually adopted Rasta beliefs and practices, resulting in their ultimate acceptance of Haile Selassie's central importance.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=55}} Rastas often claim that\u2014rather than converting to the religion\u2014they were actually always a Rasta and that their embrace of its beliefs was merely the realisation of this.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=6}} There is no formal ritual carried out to mark an individual's entry into the Rastafari movement.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=128}} Rastas regard themselves as an exclusive and elite community, membership of which is restricted to those who have the \"insight\" to recognise Haile Selassie's importance.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=9}} Practitioners thus often regard themselves as the \"enlightened ones\" who have \"seen the light\".{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=57}} Many see no point in establishing good relations with non-Rastas, believing that the latter will never accept Rastafari doctrine as truth.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|pp=57\u201358}}\n\nSome Rastas have left the religion. Clarke noted that among British Rastas, some returned to Pentecostalism and other forms of Christianity, while others embraced [[Islam]] or no religion.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=59}} Some English ex-Rastas described disillusionment when the societal transformation promised by Rastafari failed to appear, while others felt that while Rastafari would be appropriate for agrarian communities in Africa and the Caribbean, it was not suited to industrialised British society.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=59}} Some experienced disillusionment after developing the view that Haile Selassie had been an oppressive leader of the Ethiopian people.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=59}} Cashmore found that some British Rastas who had more militant views left the religion after finding its focus on reasoning and music insufficient for the struggle against white domination and racism.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=97}}\n\n===Regional spread===\n\nAlthough it remains most concentrated in the Caribbean,{{sfn|Loadenthal|2013|p=2}} Rastafari has spread to many areas of the world and adapted into many localised variants.{{sfn|Hansing|2001|p=733}} It has spread primarily in Anglophone regions and countries, largely because reggae music has primarily been produced in the English language.{{sfn|Hansing|2006|p=63}} It is thus most commonly found in the Anglophone Caribbean, United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand, and Anglophone parts of Africa.{{sfn|Hansing|2006|p=64}}\n\n====Jamaica and the Americas====\n[[File:Jamaican Man.jpg|thumb|upright|A Rastafari man in Jamaica.]]\n\nBarrett described Rastafari as \"the largest, most identifiable, indigenous movement in Jamaica.\"{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=viii}} In the mid-1980s, there were approximately 70,000 members and sympathisers of Rastafari in Jamaica.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=16}} The majority of them were male, working-class, former Christians aged between 18 and 40.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=16}} In the 2011 Jamaican census, 29,026 individuals identified as Rastas.<ref name=\"state2007\">{{cite web|url=https://2001-2009.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2007/90259.htm |title=Jamaica |publisher=[[Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor]] (US State Department)|date=September 14, 2007 |accessdate=2010-10-20}}</ref> Jamaica's Rastas were initially entirely from the Afro-Jamaican majority,{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=2}} and although most remain Afro-Jamaican, Rastafari has also gained members from the island's [[Chinese Jamaicans|Chinese]], [[Indo-Jamaicans|Indian]], Afro-Chinese, Afro-Jewish, [[mulatto]], and [[White Jamaican|white]] minorities.{{sfn|Barrett|1997|pp=2\u20133}} Until 1965 the vast majority were from the lower classes, although it has since attracted many middle-class members; by the 1980s there were Jamaican Rastas working as lawyers and university professors.{{sfn|Barrett|1997|pp=2, 241}} Jamaica is often valorised by Rastas as the fountain-head of their faith, and many Rastas living elsewhere travel to the island on [[pilgrimage]].{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=87}}\n\nBoth through travel between the islands,{{sfn|Gjerset|1994|p=67}} and through reggae's popularity,{{sfnm|1a1=Gjerset|1y=1994|1p=67|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=81}} Rastafari spread across the eastern Caribbean during the 1970s. Here, its ideas complemented the anti-colonial and Afrocentric views prevalent in countries like Trinidad, Grenada, Dominica, and St Vincent.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=81}} In these countries, the early Rastas often engaged in cultural and political movements to a greater extent than their Jamaican counterparts had.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=82}} Various Rastas were involved in Grenada's 1979 [[New Jewel Movement]] and were given positions in the Grenadine government until it was overthrown and replaced following the [[Invasion of Grenada|U.S. invasion of 1983]].{{sfnm|1a1=Campbell|1y=1980|1pp=50\u201351|2a1=Simpson|2y=1985|2p=291|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=82}} Although [[Fidel Castro]]'s Marxist\u2013Leninist government generally discouraged foreign influences, Rastafari was introduced to Cuba alongside reggae in the 1970s.{{sfnm|1a1=Hansing|1y=2001|1p=734|2a1=Hansing|2y=2006|2p=65|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3pp=82\u201383}} Foreign Rastas studying in Cuba during the 1990s connected with its reggae scene and helped to further ground it in Rasta beliefs.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=82\u201383}} In Cuba, most Rastas have been male and from the [[Afro-Cuban]] population.{{sfnm|1a1=Hansing|1y=2001|1p=736|2a1=Hansing|2y=2006|2p=69}}\n\nRastafari was introduced to the United States and Canada with the migration of Jamaicans to continental North America in the 1960s and 1970s.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=72}} American police were often suspicious of Rastas and regarded Rastafari as a criminal sub-culture.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=76}} Rastafari also attracted converts from within several Native American communities,{{sfn|Hansing|2001|p=733}} and picked up some support from white members of the [[Hippy]] subculture, which was then in decline.{{sfn|Loadenthal|2013|p=12}} In Latin America, small communities of Rastas have also established in Brazil, Panama, and Nicaragua.{{sfn|Hansing|2006|p=64}}\n\n====Africa====\n\nSome Rastas in the African diaspora have followed through with their beliefs about resettlement in Africa, with Ghana and Nigeria being particularly favoured.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=78}} Caribbean Rastas arrived in Ghana during the 1960s, encouraged by its first post-independence president, [[Kwame Nkrumah]], while some native Ghanaians also converted to the religion.{{sfn|White|2010|pp=304, 306\u2013307}} The largest congregation of Rastas has been in southern parts of Ghana, around [[Accra]], [[Tema]], and the [[Cape Coast]],{{sfn|White|2010|p=314}} although Rasta communities also exist in the Muslim-majority area of northern Ghana.{{sfn|Middleton|2006|p=152}} The Rasta migrants' wearing of dreadlocks was akin to that of the native [[fetish priest]]s, which may have assisted the presentation of these Rastas as having authentic African roots in Ghanaian society.{{sfn|Middleton|2006|pp=154\u2013155}} However, Ghanaian Rastas have complained of social ostracism and prosecution for cannabis possession, while non-Rastas in often consider them to be \"drop-outs\", \"too Western\", and \"not African enough\".{{sfn|Middleton|2006|pp=161\u2013162}} Another West African group to

Rastafari.{{sfn|Savishinsky|1994|p=211}} The popularity of dreadlocks and marijuana among the Baye Faal may have been spread in large part through access to Rasta-influenced reggae in the 1970s.{{sfn|Savishinsky|1994|p=214}} A small community of Rastas also established in Burkina Faso.{{sfn|Wittmann|2011|pp=158\u2013159}}\n\n[[File:East London, Eastern Cape, South Africa

an outlet for the economic hardship, racial discrimination, and social isolation that many faced.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=72}} It spread among the black working-classes not just of London, but also in [[Birmingham]], [[Leicester]], [[Liverpool]], [[Manchester]], and [[Bristol]].{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=58}} Its spread was aided by the [[gang]] structures that had been cultivated among black British youth by the [[rudeboy]] subculture; these gangs proved to be a breeding ground for Rastafari themes.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=56}} British Rastafari gained increasing attention in the 1970s through reggae's popularity,{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1981|1p=176|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=74}} although the police commonly regarded it as a criminal sub-culture.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=74\u201375}} Following

In fact it should be expressed by the Pope as the bishop of Rome (''urbs'' = city; ''urbi'' the corresponding dative form; compare: urban) as well as the head of the Roman Catholic Church. Thus, as it were, includes the whole world (''orbis'' = earth; ''orbi'' the corresponding dative form; compare: Orbit).\n\nThe formula is found more frequently in the language of the Church, as in the inscription at the Lateran Basilica, after which the church is: ''omnium urbis et orbis Ecclesiarum mater et caput''<ref>The British and foreign evangelical review and quarterly record of Christian literature, Vol. XV., page 39, [[James Oswald Dykes]], James Stuart Candlish, Hugh Sinclair Paterson, Joseph Samuel Exell, James Nisbet & Co., London 1866.</ref> - \"the head and mother of all churches of the city and of the earth\" = the principal and mother of all churches of the world.\n\nIn the 4th century, [[Pope Damasus I]] wrote in a letter to the [[Diocese of Illyricum|bishops of Illyricum]]:\n\n''Unde iustum est, omnes in Universo Romanorum Orbe Doctores legis, ea, quae legis sunt, sapere, et non fidem doctrinis variis maculare.''<ref>[[Cassiodorus]], ''Historia Eccl., 5, CAPUT XXIX. Litterae Damasi et caeterorum ad Illyricum contra concilium in Nicaea Thraciae factum''.</ref> - (English: \"Hence, it is just, that all doctors of the law in the Universe of the World of the Romans, those, who are of the law, are wise, and do not teach the faith with various [[doctrine]]s.\")\n\nThe ritual of the papal blessing ''Urbi et Orbi'' developed in the 13th Century during [[Pope Gregory X]], who consulted before his election with [[Niccol\u00f2 and Maffeo Polo]].<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mYlTsE7SmUYC&pg=PA294 |page=294 |title=A Natural History of Latin |isbn=9780191622656 |last1=Janson |first1=Tore |date=2007-01-25 }}</ref><ref>The Travels Of Marco Polo, page 214, Henry Yule, Plain Label Books, {{ISBN|978-1-60303-615-3}}</ref>\n\n== Occasions ==\n[[File:Petersdom (Fassade).jpg|thumb|The fa\u00e7ade of Saint Peter's Basilica with loggia balcony, where the Pope usually gives the blessing ''Urbi et Orbi'']]\nThe ''Urbi et Orbi'' address and blessing is the most solemn form of blessing in the Catholic Church, and is reserved for the most solemn occasions. These occasions include [[Easter]], [[Christmas]], and the proclamation of a newly elected pope concluding a conclave.\n\n''Urbi et orbi'' blessings are usually given from the central [[loggia]] of [[Saint Peter's Basilica]] in Rome, at noontime, and are broadcast worldwide through the [[European Broadcasting Union]] and other linkups. The address concludes with greetings in many languages in relation to the feast celebrated.\n\nThe [[Roman Catholic Church]] grants a [[plenary indulgence]] by the willful grace and intent of the [[Pope]], on the usual conditions, to those who \"devoutly receive\" the blessing that the Pope imparts ''Urbi et Orbi''.\n\nFor any ordinary plenary indulgence, the \"usual conditions\" are:\n* Reception of [[Sacrament of Penance (Catholic Church)|sacramental confession]] through a [[Catholic priest]] within 20 days (before or after) of performing the specific work\n* Reception of [[Eucharist|Eucharistic communion]] within 20 days (before or after) of performing the specific work \n* Prayers for the [[Holy actions#Intentions|intentions of the Pope]] designated for that particular month or occasion, usually at the same time the work is performed, though recitation some days before or after also suffices\n\nGaining a plenary indulgence requires that a baptized Roman Catholic must also exclude any attachment to [[sin]], even [[venial sin]].<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/tribunals/apost_penit/documents/rc_trib_appen_doc_20020826_enchiridion-indulgentiarum_lt.html Normae de Indulgentiis, 20]</ref>\n\nSince 1985, this indulgence is granted not only to the people in [[Saint Peter's Square]], but also to those who though unable to be physically present, \"piously follow\" it by radio or television.<ref>''Enchiridion Indulgentiarum'', \"Aliae Concessiones\", 4</ref><ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1985/12/19/world/vatican-to-allow-indulgences-by-tv.html John Tagliabue, \"Vatican to allow indulgences by TV\", ''New York Times'', 19 December 1985]</ref>\n\nThis is now extended to all who receive the [[papal blessing]] over the Internet (\"the new communications medium\"), since the blessing is preceded by an announcement by a [[Cardinal (Catholic Church)|Cardinal]] (usually the [[Cardinal Protodeacon]]): \"His Holiness Pope N. grants a plenary indulgence in the form laid down by the Church to all the faithful present and to those who receive his blessing by radio, television and the new communications media.

Besides that, another systematic occasion for the ''Urbi et Orbi'' comes at the end of a [[papal conclave]] when the new pope makes his first appearance to the world following his election.  In addition, Popes [[Pope John Paul II|John Paul II]], [[Pope Benedict XVI|Benedict XVI]], and [[Pope Francis|Francis]] started with a short speech, with the latter requesting prayers from the faithful, and John Paul II deliberately mispronouncing the word \u201ccorrect\u201d in Italian in an effort to gain the support of the followers below.{{cn|date=November 2018}}  The people were nervous about having a non-Italian as pope for the first time since the Dutch born [[Pope Adrian VI]] who reigned from January 1522 to September of 1523.\n\nOn 27 March 2020, Pope Francis imparted an extraordinary ''Urbi et Orbi'' blessing in response to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vaticannews.va/en/pope/news/2020-03/pope-francis-urbi-et-orbi-blessing-coronavirus.html|title=Pope\u2019s special Urbi et Orbi blessing: \u2018God turns everything to our good\u2019 - Vatican News|date=2020-03-27|website=vaticannews.va|language=en|access-date=2020-03-28}}</ref> He stood in the door of [[Saint Peter's Basilica]], at the head of [[Saint Peter's Square]] (without the presence of the public) following a prayer.<ref>{{cite news|date=22 March 2020|work=[[Holy See]]|title=Declaration of the Director of the Holy See Press Office, Matteo Bruni|url=https://press.vatican.va/content/salastampa/en/bollettino/pubblico/2020/03/22/200322b.html|accessdate=23 March 2020}}.</ref> For this blessing, the [[Apostolic Penitentiary]] loosened the requirements to receive the [[Eucharist]] and go to [[Sacrament of Penance|confession]], due to the impossibility for people affected by lockdowns and suspension of liturgies.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ncregister.com/blog/joseph-pronechen/vatican-grants-special-plenary-indulgences-during-coronavirus|title=Here\u2019s How You Can Get the Vatican\u2019s New Coronavirus Indulgences|website=National Catholic Register|access-date=2020-03-27}}</ref> The [[Salus Populi Romani|''Salus Populi Romani'']] image and the crucifix from the church of [[San Marcello al Corso]] were brought to the square for the occasion.

In the jubilee year of 1650 [[Pope Innocent XI]] did so at [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]], Pentecost, and [[All Saints' Day|All Saints]]. He and later Popes gave such special-occasion blessings from the balcony of the [[Quirinal Palace]], which was then the papal residence.<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15221a.htm Andrew Meehan, \"Urbi et Orbi\" in ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]] (New York 1912)]</ref>\n\nAfter the occupation, [[Pope Pius IX]] considered himself a \"[[prisoner in the Vatican]]\" and in protest ceased to give the blessing. The practice was later resumed, though in a more limited manner, following [[Lateran Treaty|the resolution]] of the so-called \"[[Roman Question]]\" (i.e., the legal relationship between the [[Holy See]] and the Italian government).\n\n==Other uses==\nIt is the motto of [[Long Island University]].\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Religion}}\n* [[List of ecclesiastical abbreviations]]\n* [[List of Latin phrases]]\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15221a.htm ''Urbi et Orbi''] article from ''[[The Catholic Encyclopedia]]''\n* {{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02602a.htm|title=Apostolic Blessing|encyclopedia=[[The Catholic Encyclopedia]]}}\n* [http://www.papaluciani.it/prima.wav Audio of Pope John Paul I's blessing following his election as Pope]\n* [https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/messages/urbi/ Pope John Paul II's ''Urbi et Orbi'' messages]\n* [https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/messages/urbi/index_en.htm Pope Benedict XVI's ''Urbi et Orbi'' messages]\n{{Papacy}}\n[[Category:Holy See]]\n[[Category:Latin religious words and phrases]]\n", "text_old": "{{Italic title}}\n[[File:2008 Xmas Urbi Orbi Pope Benedict XVI.jpg|thumb|The 2008 ''Urbi et Orbi'' given by [[Pope Benedict XVI]] on [[Christmas Day]], from [[Saint Peter's Square]], [[Vatican City]]]]\n\n'''''Urbi et Orbi''''' ('to the [[:wikt:urbs|city]] [of Rome] and to the [[:wikt:orbis|world]]') denotes a papal address and [[Apostolic Blessing|apostolic blessing]] given by the [[pope]] on certain solemn occasions.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe term ''Urbi et Orbi'' evolved from the consciousness of the ancient Roman Empire. In fact it should be expressed by the Pope as the bishop of Rome (''urbs'' = city; ''urbi'' the corresponding dative form; compare: urban) as well as the head of the Roman Catholic Church. Thus, as it were, includes the whole world (''orbis'' = earth; ''orbi'' the corresponding dative form; compare: Orbit).\n\nThe formula is found more frequently in the language of the Church, as in the inscription at the Lateran Basilica, after which the church is: ''omnium urbis et orbis Ecclesiarum mater et caput''<ref>The British and foreign evangelical review and quarterly record of Christian literature, Vol. XV., page 39, [[James Oswald Dykes]], James Stuart Candlish, Hugh Sinclair Paterson, Joseph Samuel Exell, James Nisbet & Co., London 1866.</ref> - \"the head and mother of all churches of the city and of the earth\" = the principal and mother of all churches of the world.\n\nIn the 4th century, [[Pope Damasus I]] wrote in a letter to the [[Diocese of Illyricum|bishops of Illyricum]]:\n\n''Unde iustum est, omnes in Universo Romanorum Orbe Doctores legis, ea, quae legis sunt, sapere, et non fidem doctrinis variis maculare.''<ref>[[Cassiodorus]], ''Historia Eccl., 5, CAPUT XXIX. Litterae Damasi et caeterorum ad Illyricum contra concilium in Nicaea Thraciae factum''.</ref> - (English: \"Hence, it is just, that all doctors of the law in the Universe of the World of the Romans, those, who are of the law, are wise, and do not teach the faith with various [[doctrine]]s.\")\n\nThe ritual of the papal blessing ''Urbi et Orbi'' developed in the 13th Century during [[Pope Gregory X]], who consulted before his election with [[Niccol\u00f2 and Maffeo Polo]].<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mYlTsE7SmUYC&pg=PA294 |page=294 |title=A Natural History of Latin |isbn=9780191622656 |last1=Janson |first1=Tore |date=2007-01-25 }}</ref><ref>The Travels Of Marco Polo, page 214, Henry Yule, Plain Label Books, {{ISBN|978-1-60303-615-3}}</ref>\n\n== Occasions ==\n[[File:Petersdom (Fassade).jpg|thumb|The fa\u00e7ade of Saint Peter's Basilica with loggia balcony, where the Pope usually gives the blessing ''Urbi et Orbi'']]\nThe ''Urbi et Orbi'' address and blessing is the most solemn form of blessing in the Catholic Church, and is reserved for the most solemn occasions. These occasions include [[Easter]], [[Christmas]], and the proclamation of a newly elected pope concluding a conclave.\n\n''Urbi et orbi'' blessings are usually given from the central [[loggia]] of [[Saint Peter's Basilica]] in Rome, at noontime, and are broadcast worldwide through the [[European Broadcasting Union]] and other linkups. The address concludes with greetings in many languages in relation to the feast celebrated.\n\nThe [[Roman Catholic Church]] grants a [[plenary indulgence]] by the willful grace and intent of the [[Pope]], on the usual conditions, to those who \"devoutly receive\" the blessing that the Pope imparts ''Urbi et Orbi''.\n\nFor any ordinary plenary indulgence, the \"usual conditions\" are:\n* Reception of [[Sacrament of Penance (Catholic Church)|sacramental confession]] through a [[Catholic priest]] within 20 days (before or after) of performing the specific work\n* Reception of [[Eucharist|Eucharistic communion]] within 20 days (before or after) of performing the specific work \n* Prayers for the [[Holy actions#Intentions|intentions of the Pope]] designated for that particular month or occasion, usually at the same time the work is performed, though recitation some days before or after also suffices\n\nGaining a plenary indulgence requires that a baptized Roman Catholic must also exclude any attachment to [[sin]], even [[venial sin]].<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/tribunals/apost_penit/documents/rc_trib_appen_doc_20020826_enchiridion-indulgentiarum_lt.html Normae de Indulgentiis, 20]</ref>\n\nSince 1985, this indulgence is granted not only to the people in [[Saint Peter's Square]], but also to those who though unable to be physically present, \"piously follow\" it by radio or television.<ref>''Enchiridion Indulgentiarum'', \"Aliae Concessiones\", 4</ref><ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1985/12/19/world/vatican-to-allow-indulgences-by-tv.html John Tagliabue, \"Vatican to allow indulgences by TV\", ''New York Times'', 19 December 1985]</ref>\n\nThis is now extended to all who receive the [[papal blessing]] over the Internet (\"the new communications medium\"), since the blessing is preceded by an announcement by a [[Cardinal (Catholic Church)|Cardinal]] (usually the [[Cardinal Protodeacon]]): \"His Holiness Pope N. grants a plenary indulgence in the form laid down by the Church to all the faithful present and to those who receive his blessing by radio, television and the new communications media.

Some labeled the DREAM Act as [[amnesty]] that would encourage [[chain migration]] and further illegal immigration in anticipation of new versions of the DREAM Act. Others stated that the DREAM Act, though worthy legislation, should be enacted only as part of a comprehensive [[immigration reform]].\n\nSenator [[Kay Bailey Hutchison]], who had previously stated that she would oppose consideration of the DREAM Act, announced on the Senate floor that she had expressed reservations to Durbin and he had made a verbal commitment to work with her to make changes that she saw necessary to garner greater Republican support. In response, Durbin announced that the first amendment that would be considered, should debate of the DREAM Act begin, would completely re-write the bill in favor of the language that Hutchison suggested. According to her suggestions, illegal immigrant students should be allowed to hold a temporary student visa with a renewable work permit instead of conditional permanent residency.

The first estimate is based on analysis from a study by the Migration Policy Institute's National Center on Immigrant Integration Policy, an organization seeking to \"advance the economic mobility and social inclusion of immigrants in the United States\",<ref name = MPI>{{cite web | title = About the Center | publisher = National Center on Immigrant Integration Policy | url = http://www.migrationinformation.org/integration/about.cfm}}</ref> which estimated that 38% of those eligible for the DREAM Act's benefits would actually obtain legal permanent resident status. In that scenario, the NAIDC estimates that DREAM Act beneficiaries would earn $1.4 trillion over a 40-year period. On the other hand, NAIDC estimates that if ''all'' those eligible for DREAM Act benefits successfully met the education or military service requirements and obtained legal resident status, they would earn $3.6 trillion over the same 40-year period. How many dollars they would use of available federal, state and local resources over the 40-year period was not estimated.<ref>[http://naid.ucla.edu/uploads/4/2/1/9/4219226/no_dreamers_left_behind.pdf No DREAMers Left Behind] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708124245/http://www.naid.ucla.edu/uploads/4/2/1/9/4219226/no_dreamers_left_behind.pdf |date=July 8, 2011 }}, North American Integration and Development Center, University of California, Los Angeles.</ref>\n\n=== Education ===\nEducation is a major priority for The DREAM Act.

Both his social and fiscal beliefs are seen as [[Democratic Party (United States)#Ideology|left-leaning]]. However, he has expressed his desire and intent to work with Republicans across the aisle on all issues. Many of his newly-appointed cabinet members are registered Republicans.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Schreiner |first1=Bruce |title=Democrat Beshear looking for ways to bridge partisan divide |url=https://www.lex18.com/media/v/content/6ac8f6bb22f140d5ad7680cf6f7b6e6b |agency=LEX18 |date=November 24, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Criminal justice===\nAs [[Kentucky Attorney General]], Beshear fought companies responsible for Kentucky's [[opioid crisis]] and got US$9.5 million in settlements for 16 treatment centers across the state. Beshear signed an executive order as governor to completely restore the voting rights of those convicted of non-violent [[felonies]], as the law preventing them to vote is widely seen as an unfair tactic to suppress the African American vote, as 4 percent of African American adults in Kentucky are convicted non-violent felons. The executive order restored voting rights to over 100,000 people in Kentucky.<ref name=felons />\n\n===Economic policy===\nBeshear states that he wants to bring more advanced manufacturing jobs to Kentucky to offset job losses due to the decline of coal. In addition, Beshear wants to increase the number of health care jobs in the state. Beshear opposes the  [[right-to-work law]] signed by his predecessor, [[Matt Bevin]].<ref name=swearin>{{cite web|title=Andy Beshear Swearing In|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtgPjZdZ2OU|publisher=WLKY News Louisville|access-date=December 10, 2019|via=YouTube}}</ref>\n\n===Education===\nBeshear supports a major pay raise for all teachers in Kentucky, who earn one of the lowest salaries of any teachers in the country.<ref name=swearin />\n\n===Environment===\nBeshear accepts the [[scientific consensus on climate change|scientific consensus]] that global warming and climate change are real and caused by humans. Beshear wants to create more clean energy jobs to employ those who got laid off of their coal jobs. Beshear wants to expand clean coal technology in Kentucky.<ref name=issues>{{cite web|title=On The Issues|url=https://andybeshear.com/on-the-issues/|publisher=Andy Beshear for Governor|accessdate=December 10, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Equality===\nBeshear supports [[same-sex marriage]] and equal rights for [[LGTBQ]] people. When he was attorney general, 60% of his staff were minorities and women.<ref name=issues />\n\n===Health care===\nBeshear supports Kentucky's medicaid expansion, which provides affordable health care to over 500,000 Kentuckians, including all people with pre-existing conditions. Beshear criticized his predecessor, [[Matt Bevin]], for trying to roll back the state's medicaid expansion (which ultimately failed). As Attorney General and Governor, Beshear repeatedly expressed support for the [[Affordable Care Act]] (known as Obamacare), and criticized a Texas judge for ruling it as unconstitutional.<ref name=issues />\n\n===Infrastructure===\nBeshear supports the project to replace the structurally deficient [[Brent Spence Bridge]], which carries Interstates [[Interstate 71 in Kentucky|71]] and [[Interstate 75 in Kentucky|75]] over the [[Ohio River]] between [[Covington, KY]] and [[Cincinnati, OH]]. The project has long been delayed, and the bridge is considered to be the most critical transportation link in the state of Kentucky. Beshear has expressed willingness to work with [[Ohio]] governor [[Mike DeWine]], a Republican, to start the project. Beshear hopes to fund the bridge through conventional means and not tolling, however, he is unsure if the state has the funds to do that.<ref>{{cite web|title=Kentucky governor candidates face off in final debate|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QX-ouG5QL7o&t=1287s|publisher=WLKY News Louisville|accessdate=December 10, 2019}}</ref>\n\nBeshear has also expressed support for the construction of the [[Interstate 69 Ohio River Bridge]] between [[Henderson, Kentucky]] and [[Evansville, Indiana]]. He has stated that the project would be a priority for his first term, believing it would provide economic benefits to Western Kentucky.<ref>{{cite news |last1=White |first1=Douglas |title=Beshear says 'we will build I-69 bridge in my first term' |url=https://www.thegleaner.com/story/news/2019/08/27/andy-beshear-says-we-build-69-bridge-my-first-term/2130227001/ |accessdate=December 15, 2019 |agency=Henderson Gleaner |date=August 27, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Pensions===\nBeshear supports expanding gaming and gambling in Kentucky to help fund the state's pension system, which has accumulated US$24 billion in debt since 2000, the most of any state in the country. Beshear opposes pension cuts made by his predecessor, [[Matt Bevin]], and wants to guarantee all workers pensions for when they retire.<ref name=issues />\n\n== Personal life ==\nBeshear and his wife Britainy are both members of the [[Christian Church (Disciples of Christ)]] and serve as deacons.<ref>{{Cite
