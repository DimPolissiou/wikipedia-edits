Currently the largest of the Formosan languages, it is spoken from [[Hualien City|Hualien]] in the north to [[Taitung City|Taitung]] in the south, with another population near the southern end of the island, though the northern varieties are considered to be separate languages.\n\nGovernment services in counties where many [[Amis people]] live in Taiwan, such as the Hualien and Taitung railway stations, broadcast in Amis alongside Mandarin. However, few Amis under the age of 20 in 1995 spoke the language, and it is not known how many of the 138,000 ethnic Amis are speakers.\n\n==Dialects==\nAmis is a [[dialect cluster]]. There are five dialects, Southern Amis, Tavalong-Vataan, Central Amis, Chengkung-Kwangshan, and Northern Amis (Nanshi Amis, which includes Nataoran).\n\n[[Sakizaya language|Sakizaya]] is a moribund language spoken among the northernmost ethnic Amis but is mutually unintelligible with the Northern Amis dialect.\n\n==Phonology==\nThe following discussion covers the central dialect of Amis (Maddieson & Wright).\n\n===Consonants===\n{| class=\"IPA wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!  !! [[Labial consonant|Labial]] !! [[Dental consonant|Dental]] !!  [[Alveolar consonant|Alveolar]]  !! [[Palatal consonant|Palatal]] !! [[Velar consonant|Velar]] !! [[Epiglottal consonant|Epiglottal]] !!

Lateral [[flap consonant|flap]]\n| ||  || \u027a\u0320 || || || ||\n|-\n! [[Approximant consonant|Approximants]]\n| w || || || j || || ||\n|}\n\nThe voiceless plosives {{IPA|/p t k \u02a1/}} and the affricate {{IPA|/t\u0361s/}} are [[Unreleased stop|released]] in clusters, so that ''cecay'' \"one\" is pronounced {{IPA|[t\u0361s\u1d4at\u0361saj]}}; as is {{IPA|/s/}}: ''sepat'' \"four\" is {{IPA|[s\u1d4apat\u02b0]}}. The glottal stop is an exception, frequently having no audible release in final position. The [[Voice (phonetics)|voiced]] fricatives, {{IPA|/v \u026e \u0263/}} (the latter found only in loanwords) are devoiced to {{IPA|[f \u026c x]}} in utterance-final and sometimes initial position. {{IPA|/\u026e/}} may be [[interdental]] or post-dental. The sibilants, {{IPA|/t\u0361s s/}}, are optionally palatalized ({{IPA|[t\u0361\u0255 \u0255]}}) before {{IPA|/i/}}. {{IPA|/j/}} does not occur in word-initial position. {{IPA|/\u027a/}} is often post-alveolar, and in final position it is released: {{IPA|[\u02a1u\u02a1u\u027a\u0320\u1d4a]}} \"fog\".\n\n{{IPA|/\u026e/}} shows dramatic dialectical variation. In [[Fengbin, Hualien|Fengbin]], a town in the center of Amis territory, it is pronounced as a [[Central consonant|central]] dental fricative, {{IPA|[\u00f0\u032a]}}, whereas in the town of Kangko, only {{convert|15|km|abbr=on}} away, it is a [[Lateral consonant|lateral]] {{IPA|[\u026e\u032a]}}. In Northern Amis, it is a plosive {{IPA|[d\u032a]}}, which may be laxed to {{IPA|[\u00f0\u032a]}} intervocalically. The epiglottals are also reported to have different pronunciations in the north, but the descriptions are contradictory. In Central Amis, {{IPA|/\u029c/}} is always voiceless and {{IPA|/\u02a1/}} is often accompanied by vibrations that suggest it involves an epiglottal trill {{IPAblink|\u02a2}}. Edmondson and Elsing report that these are true epiglottals initially and medially, but in utterance-final position they are [[epiglotto-pharyngeal consonant|epiglotto\u2013pharyngeal]].\n\nSakizaya, considered to be a separate language, contrasts a voiced {{IPA|/z/}} with voiceless {{IPA|/s/}}.\n\nIn the practical orthography, {{IPA|/ts/}} is written {{angle bracket|c}}, {{IPA|/j/}} {{angle bracket|y}}, {{IPA|/\u02a1/}} {{angle bracket|'}}, {{IPA|/\u0294/}} {{angle bracket|^}}, {{IPA|/\u026e/}} {{angle bracket|d}}, {{IPA|/\u014b/}} {{angle bracket|ng}}, and {{IPA|/\u029c/}} {{angle bracket|x}}.\n\n===Vowels===\n{| class=\"IPA wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!  !! Front !! Central !! Back\n|-\n! Closed\n| i ||   || u\n|-\n! Mid\n|   || (\u0259\u0306) || \n|-\n! Open\n|  || a ||\n|}\n\nAmis has three common vowels, {{IPA|/i a u/}}. Despite the fact that a great deal of latitude is afforded by only needing to distinguish three vowels, Amis vowels stay close to their cardinal values, though there is more movement of {{IPA|/a/}} and {{IPA|/u/}} toward each other (tending to the {{IPA|[o]}} range) than there is in front-vowel space (in the {{IPA|[e]}} range).\n\nA voiceless epenthetic schwa optionally breaks up consonant clusters, as noted above.

Currently the largest of the Formosan languages, it is spoken from [[Hualien City|Hualien]] in the north to [[Taitung City|Taitung]] in the south, with another population near the southern end of the island, though the northern varieties are considered to be separate languages.\n\nGovernment services in counties where many [[Amis people]] live in Taiwan, such as the Hualien and Taitung railway stations, broadcast in Amis alongside Mandarin. However, few Amis under the age of 20 in 1995 spoke the language, and it is not known how many of the 138,000 ethnic Amis are speakers.\n\n==Dialects==\nAmis is a [[dialect cluster]]. There are five dialects, Southern Amis, Tavalong-Vataan, Central Amis, Chengkung-Kwangshan, and Northern Amis (Nanshi Amis, which includes Nataoran).\n\n[[Sakizaya language|Sakizaya]] is a moribund language spoken among the northernmost ethnic Amis but is mutually unintelligible with the Northern Amis dialect.\n\n==Phonology==\nThe following discussion covers the central dialect of Amis (Maddieson & Wright).\n\n===Consonants===\n{| class=\"IPA wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!  !!

[[Approximant consonant|Approximants]]\n| w || || || j || || ||\n|}\n\nThe voiceless plosives {{IPA|/p t k \u02a1/}} and the affricate {{IPA|/t\u0361s/}} are [[Unreleased stop|released]] in clusters, so that ''cecay'' \"one\" is pronounced {{IPA|[t\u0361s\u1d4at\u0361saj]}}; as is {{IPA|/s/}}: ''sepat'' \"four\" is {{IPA|[s\u1d4apat\u02b0]}}. The glottal stop is an exception, frequently having no audible release in final position. The [[Voice (phonetics)|voiced]] fricatives, {{IPA|/v \u026e \u0263/}} (the latter found only in loanwords) are devoiced to {{IPA|[f \u026c x]}} in utterance-final and sometimes initial position. {{IPA|/\u026e/}} may be [[interdental]] or post-dental. The sibilants, {{IPA|/t\u0361s s/}}, are optionally palatalized ({{IPA|[t\u0361\u0255 \u0255]}}) before {{IPA|/i/}}. {{IPA|/j/}} does not occur in word-initial position. {{IPA|/\u027a/}} is often post-alveolar, and in final position it is released: {{IPA|[\u02a1u\u02a1u\u027a\u0320\u1d4a]}} \"fog\".\n\n{{IPA|/\u026e/}} shows dramatic dialectical variation. In [[Fengbin, Hualien|Fengbin]], a town in the center of Amis territory, it is pronounced as a [[Central consonant|central]] dental fricative, {{IPA|[\u00f0\u032a]}}, whereas in the town of Kangko, only {{convert|15|km|abbr=on}} away, it is a [[Lateral consonant|lateral]] {{IPA|[\u026e\u032a]}}. In Northern Amis, it is a plosive {{IPA|[d\u032a]}}, which may be laxed to {{IPA|[\u00f0\u032a]}} intervocalically. The epiglottals are also reported to have different pronunciations in the north, but the descriptions are contradictory. In Central Amis, {{IPA|/\u029c/}} is always voiceless and {{IPA|/\u02a1/}} is often accompanied by vibrations that suggest it involves an epiglottal trill {{IPAblink|\u02a2}}. Edmondson and Elsing report that these are true epiglottals initially and medially, but in utterance-final position they are [[epiglotto-pharyngeal consonant|epiglotto\u2013pharyngeal]].\n\nSakizaya, considered to be a separate language, contrasts a voiced {{IPA|/z/}} with voiceless {{IPA|/s/}}.\n\nIn the practical orthography, {{IPA|/ts/}} is written {{angle bracket|c}}, {{IPA|/j/}} {{angle bracket|y}}, {{IPA|/\u02a1/}} {{angle bracket|'}}, {{IPA|/\u0294/}} {{angle bracket|^}}, {{IPA|/\u026e/}} {{angle bracket|d}}, {{IPA|/\u014b/}} {{angle bracket|ng}}, and {{IPA|/\u029c/}} {{angle bracket|x}}.\n\n===Vowels===\n{| class=\"IPA wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!  !!

Despite the fact that a great deal of latitude is afforded by only needing to distinguish three vowels, Amis vowels stay close to their cardinal values, though there is more movement of {{IPA|/a/}} and {{IPA|/u/}} toward each other (tending to the {{IPA|[o]}} range) than there is in front-vowel space (in the {{IPA|[e]}} range).\n\nA voiceless epenthetic schwa optionally breaks up consonant clusters, as noted above. However, there are a small number of words where a short schwa (written ''e)'' may be phonemic. However, no contrast involving the schwa is known, and if it is also epenthetic, then Amis has words with no phonemic vowels at all. Examples of this ''e'' are ''malmes'' \"sad\", pronounced {{IPA|[ma\u027a\u0259\u0306m\u02d0\u0259\u0306s]}}, and ''\u2019nem'' \"six\", pronounced {{IPA|[\u02a1n\u0259\u0306m]}} or {{IPA|[\u02a1\u0259\u0306n\u0259\u0306m]}}.\n\n== Examples of words ==\n{|width=\"100%\"|\n|width=\"33%\" valign=\"top\"|\n*lotong: monkey/ape\n*fafoy: pig\n*wacu: dog\n|width=\"33%\" valign=\"top\"|\n*cecay: one\n*tosa: two\n*tolo: three\n*sepat: four\n*lima: five\n|width=\"33%\" valign=\"top\"|\n*enem: six\n*pito: seven\n*falo: eight\n*siwa: nine\n*polo': ten\n|-\n|}\n\n* Compare with [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] baboy (pig), tatlo (3), apat (4), lima (5), anim (6), pito (7), walo (8)\n* Compare with [[Kapampangan language|Kapampangan]] asu (dog), atlo (3), apat (4), lima (5), anam (6), pitu/pito (7), walu/walo (8), siyam (9), apulu/apulo (10) and ama (father) and ima (mother)\n* Compare with [[Ilokano language|Ilokano]] baboy(pig), aso (dog), maysa (1), dua (2), tallo (3), uppat (4), lima (5), inem (6), pito (7), walo (8), siam (9), sangapulo  (10)\n* Compare with Javanese lutung (monkey), babi (pig), asu (dog), siji (1), loro (2), telu (3), papat (4), lima (5), enem (6), pitu (7), wolu (8), sanga (9), sepuluh (10)\n* Compare with Sundanese lutung (monkey), babi (pig), hiji (1), dua (2), tilu (3), opat (4), lima (5), genep (6), tujuh (7), dalapan (8), salapan (9), sapuluh (10)\n* Compare with [[Malay language|Malay]] lotong (monkey), babi (pig), satu (1), dua (2), telu (3), empat (4), lima (5), enam (6), sembilan (9), sepuluh (10)\n*maolah kako mimali = I like to play sports.\n*takaraw ko pita\u2019kod = I jump very high.\n*kalamkam ko kacomikay = I run very fast.\n*Ira ko tata\u2019angay a mata ako = I have big eyes\n*mamangay a ngoyos\u2019= A small mouth\n*takaya\u2019ay a fokes = long hair\n*sowal san ko kahacecay a tamdaw makapahay kako = Everyone tells me that I am beautiful.\n*mafana\u2019ay miasik, misawsaw to kaysing, milidong to fodoy = I can sweep the floor, wash dishes and clothing.\n*maolah midemak kako to tayal no loma\u2019 = I love to do household chores.\n*nawhani maolah kako to loma\u2019 no mako = Because I love my home.\n\n==Grammar==\nVerbs in the Amis language have some inflections including [[existential clause]], [[active voice]], [[grammatical voice|passive voice]], disposal sentence, [[imperative mood]], [[optative mood]], and [[prohibitive mood]].\n\nThere are two [[word order]]s in Amis language, called '''\"General\" Word Order''' and '''\"Special\" Word Order'''.\n\nBelow are some examples of Amis sentence:\n\n===\"General\" Word Order Sentence I : Verb\u2013subject===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!
