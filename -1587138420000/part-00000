However, in 1934 the University was reestablished again, and continued to work through the difficult years of [[World War II]] experiencing a shortage of [[teacher|faculty members]].\n\nBy its 40th anniversary in 1959, the University already had 13 [[faculty (university)|faculties]]. The [[Azerbaijan Medical University]] and [[Azerbaijan State Economic University]] were both spun-offs of the original respective faculties at BSU.\n\nAmong the graduates of BSU were two former presidents of [[Azerbaijan]], [[Abulfaz Elchibey]] and [[Heydar Aliyev]]. The former graduated from the Faculty of Arabic Language and Literature, while the latter, who dominated Azerbaijan's political life for over 30 years, from the Faculty of History. [[Nobel Prize]]-winning physicist [[Lev Landau]] studied at BSU between 1922 and 1924.\n\nBSU is the only university from Azerbaijan Republic ranked by international ranking organizations, such as University Ranking by Academic Performance and currently ranks at 1872 in the [[University Ranking by Academic Performance]].<ref>\n{{cite web\n | url  = http://www.urapcenter.org/2014/country.php?ccode=AZ&rank=all\n | title= 2014-2015 RANKING BY COUNTRY\n | accessdate=2015-07-18 }}\n</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Coat of arms of Baku State University in 1919.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Coat of arms of Baku State University in 1919.]]\nBSU was established on September 1, 1919 by the decision of the Parliament of [[Azerbaijan Democratic Republic]]. The University was established as a part of 4 faculties (history and philology, physics and mathematics, lawing, and medicine). The first rector of the University was the famous surgeon V. I. Razumovsky.\n\nAmong the leading professors in 1920-40 were Azerbaijani writer Abdurrahim bek Haqverdiyev, Orientalist Professor P.K. Juze, Professor A.O. Makovelski, Professor A.O. Mishel and other scholars. During that period the administration of the university invited to Baku such teachers as N.Y. Marr, V.V. Bartold, the academician of the Eastern Science Academy Fuad bek Kuprulluzade.\n\nIn 1930 the university was liquidated according to the decision made by Council of the People's Commissar on reorganization. The High Pedagogical Institute was created. Only in 1934 the state university resumed its activity and very soon became the republic's scientific-pedagogical center. Despite the great shortage of university teachers because most of teachers went to the Second World War, the university managed to keep its leading position. In 1945 the teachers took an active part in founding the Azerbaijan Academy of Science. Most of the republic's universities &mdash; such as Azerbaijan Medical University, Azerbaijan University of Economy, Azerbaijan State Pedagogical University and others &mdash; were founded on the basis of Baku State University.\n\nThe years after 1969 can be considered as the years of development in the direction of knowledge and science. Covering a wide historical period, in those years there were founded faculties on modern specialties, departments and about 30 scientific research laboratories started. As a result, there was created a strong assurance of future development. University began to develop further after Heydar Aliyev came to power. Modern specialities, departments and scientific laboratories started to operate at university. With its rich historical background, Baku State University has always been a major scientific and educational center of Azerbaijan. Famous scientists, intellectuals and politicians and Azerbaijan's outstanding politician, Heydar Aliyev graduated from Baku State University.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://bsu.edu.az/en/content/about_baku_state_university|title=Baku State University, History}}</ref> Currently,{{when|date=December 2019}} Baku State University has 16 majors with 55 bachelor and 153 master's degrees.\n\nThe 100th anniversary of Baku State University was commemorated throughout the 2019 year not only in [[Azerbaijan]], but also in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]] (September 2019) and at the headquarter of [[UNESCO]] in [[Paris]] (June 2019).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://bsu.edu.az/en/news/centenary_of_baku_state_university_celebrated_in_vienna|title=Centenary of Baku State University celebrated in Vienna|last=|first=|date=|website=Baku State University|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-12-10}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://bsu.edu.az/en/news/100th_anniversary_of_baku_state_university__celebrated_at_unesco_headquarters_in_paris|title=100th anniversary of Baku State University celebrated at UNESCO headquarters in Paris|last=|first=|date=|website=Baku State University|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-12-10}}</ref> A special medial in honor of the 100th anniversary of BSU - \u201c[[Baku State University 100th anniversary medal|The 100th jubilee (1919-2019) medal of Baku State University]]\u201d was issued by the Presidential Decree in November 2019, and 113 people were awarded this Medal.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://president.az/articles/34696|title=Establishment of the anniversary medal of the Republic of Azerbaijan \"100 years of the Baku State University (1919-2019)\"|last=|first=|date=|website=Official website of the President of Azerbaijan|language=az|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-12-10}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://president.az/articles/34958|title=Ilham Aliyev attended a ceremony marking the 100th anniversary of Baku State University|last=|first=|date=|website=Official website of the President of Azerbaijan|language=az|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-12-10}}</ref>\n\n== International relations ==\nThrough time, the university builds its international relations.

However, in 1934 the University was reestablished again, and continued to work through the difficult years of [[World War II]] experiencing a shortage of [[teacher|faculty members]].\n\nBy its 40th anniversary in 1959, the University already had 13 [[faculty (university)|faculties]]. The [[Azerbaijan Medical University]] and [[Azerbaijan State Economic University]] were both spun-offs of the original respective faculties at BSU.\n\nAmong the graduates of BSU were two former presidents of [[Azerbaijan]], [[Abulfaz Elchibey]] and [[Heydar Aliyev]]. The former graduated from the Faculty of Arabic Language and Literature, while the latter, who dominated Azerbaijan's political life for over 30 years, from the Faculty of History. [[Nobel Prize]]-winning physicist [[Lev Landau]] studied at BSU between 1922 and 1924.\n\nBSU is the only university from Azerbaijan Republic ranked by international ranking organizations, such as University Ranking by Academic Performance and currently ranks at 1872 in the [[University Ranking by Academic Performance]].<ref>\n{{cite web\n | url  = http://www.urapcenter.org/2014/country.php?ccode=AZ&rank=all\n | title= 2014-2015 RANKING BY COUNTRY\n | accessdate=2015-07-18 }}\n</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Coat of arms of Baku State University in 1919.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Coat of arms of Baku State University in 1919.]]\nBSU was established on September 1, 1919 by the decision of the Parliament of [[Azerbaijan Democratic Republic]]. The University was established as a part of 4 faculties (history and philology, physics and mathematics, lawing, and medicine). The first rector of the University was the famous surgeon V. I. Razumovsky.\n\nAmong the leading professors in 1920-40 were Azerbaijani writer Abdurrahim bek Haqverdiyev, Orientalist Professor P.K. Juze, Professor A.O. Makovelski, Professor A.O. Mishel and other scholars. During that period the administration of the university invited to Baku such teachers as N.Y. Marr, V.V. Bartold, the academician of the Eastern Science Academy Fuad bek Kuprulluzade.\n\nIn 1930 the university was liquidated according to the decision made by Council of the People's Commissar on reorganization. The High Pedagogical Institute was created. Only in 1934 the state university resumed its activity and very soon became the republic's scientific-pedagogical center. Despite the great shortage of university teachers because most of teachers went to the Second World War, the university managed to keep its leading position. In 1945 the teachers took an active part in founding the Azerbaijan Academy of Science. Most of the republic's universities &mdash; such as Azerbaijan Medical University, Azerbaijan University of Economy, Azerbaijan State Pedagogical University and others &mdash; were founded on the basis of Baku State University.\n\nThe years after 1969 can be considered as the years of development in the direction of knowledge and science. Covering a wide historical period, in those years there were founded faculties on modern specialties, departments and about 30 scientific research laboratories started. As a result, there was created a strong assurance of future development. University began to develop further after Heydar Aliyev came to power. Modern specialities, departments and scientific laboratories started to operate at university. With its rich historical background, Baku State University has always been a major scientific and educational center of Azerbaijan. Famous scientists, intellectuals and politicians and Azerbaijan's outstanding politician, Heydar Aliyev graduated from Baku State University.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://bsu.edu.az/en/content/about_baku_state_university|title=Baku State University, History}}</ref> Currently,{{when?|date=December 2019}} Baku State University has 16 majors with 55 bachelor and 153 master's degrees.\n\nThe 100th anniversary of Baku State University was commemorated throughout the 2019 year not only in [[Azerbaijan]], but also in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]] (September 2019) and at the headquarter of [[UNESCO]] in [[Paris]] (June 2019).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://bsu.edu.az/en/news/centenary_of_baku_state_university_celebrated_in_vienna|title=Centenary of Baku State University celebrated in Vienna|last=|first=|date=|website=Baku State University|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-12-10}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://bsu.edu.az/en/news/100th_anniversary_of_baku_state_university__celebrated_at_unesco_headquarters_in_paris|title=100th anniversary of Baku State University celebrated at UNESCO headquarters in Paris|last=|first=|date=|website=Baku State University|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-12-10}}</ref>A special medial in honor of the 100th anniversary of BSU - \u201c[[Baku State University 100th anniversary medal|The 100th jubilee (1919-2019) medal of Baku State University]]\u201d was issued by the Presidential Decree in November 2019, and 113 people were awarded this Medal.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://president.az/articles/34696|title=Establishment of the anniversary medal of the Republic of Azerbaijan \"100 years of the Baku State University (1919-2019)\"|last=|first=|date=|website=Official website of the President of Azerbaijan|language=az|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-12-10}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://president.az/articles/34958|title=Ilham Aliyev attended a ceremony marking the 100th anniversary of Baku State University|last=|first=|date=|website=Official website of the President of Azerbaijan|language=az|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-12-10}}</ref>\n\n== International relations ==\nThrough time, the university builds its international relations.
