The abundance of sugar during the pre-Spanish era is evident in a wide area of kabyaw including the area going to the foot of Mount Arayat. The kabyawan became familiar to the neighboring places due to the concentration of kabyawan in the place where it was located and was identified as Kabyawan and later shortened to \"Kabyaw\" and eventually altered the spelling due to the influence of the foreign alphabet letters. The used of kabyawan then is prevalent among the natives constituting mainly the ancient tribes of tagalogs that hails from Bulacan and capampangan of which they came in waves of migration from mainland Malay origin as evident from their language similarity.\nThe Kabyawan tools might have been brought by the exploring Malays and later improved by the natives settling in the island of Luzon however there are findings that most of the antiquated wooden kabyawan tools at present can be found in Ilocos where the early Sumatran and Melanesian explorers had embarked earlier than the Malays. Similarly, during that period, the natives of the mountain province whose origin is from mainland China might have been the one responsible in introducing the said crushing tools which we know now as the KABYAWAN. The settlement that has been known as Sinipit, Palasinan, Pantalan, Pinaglamoan, Kandumpa, Kambabalo, Longalong, Mayayade, Tinalan, Makabaklay, Saklang and Palanas were words and terms taken from Malay and the tribal dialect in existence during that period.\nCabiao as termed today was a just balangay of the once prosperous of empire of the campampangan settlement named Candaba, as it was discovered by the exploring Spanish conquistadores in 1590. The visita of Cabiao was perhaps established somewhere between 1765 and 1767 by the Jesuit Missionary before they were sent back to Spain under the order of King Charles III of Spain to recall all the Society of Jesus religious order to return to Spain thereby banishing them from all the Spanish dominions. Cabiao gain its full township of Pampanga in 1797 under the term of Governor General Rafael Maria de Aguilar y Ponce de Leon* with the recommendation of the returning order of the Augustinian in the Province of Pampanga and elevates the Visita of St. John Nepomucene that was established by the Jesuits into a regular Parish Church. It was established as one of the municipality of Nueva Ecija on February 9, 1848 upon the order issued by Governor General Narciso Claveria Y Zaldua and upon the recommendation made by the Governor General Marcelino Oraa. \nThe growth of Cabiao during that time maybe attributed to its vast marsh and inland water that serves as inland fishery of the area. The Poblacion comprising the three pillars of Spanish governance of the Spaniard namely the Casa Municipal, Casa dela Iglesia and Casa Judicial were erected in 1838 under the term of Don Josef Kabigting as the Gobernadorcillo (the present location of the church, the central school and the intervening residential area between the central school and the church).\n\nThe desire of the populace of Cabiao to be free from Spanish domination and tyranny resulted in the uprising on September 2, 1896. Numbering around 700 men (461 listed in the Tablet of Heroes in the Municipal Compound), the townsfolk of Cabiao and the Cabiao Brass Band under the leadership of their Capitan Municipal Mariano Nu\u00f1ez Llanera together with the people of the neighboring towns of Arayat, Deliquente (San Antonio) & Jaen led the siege against the colonizing Spaniards stationed at the Factoria of San Isidro. This event was marked as the First Cry of Nueva Ecija. It did not take too long that the Spanish Colonial Government, succumbed to cede the Archipelago of Philippines to the United States on December 10, 1898 that brought about the Treaty of Paris, and once again the Philippines was under colonial rule this time by the American. In the last days of the Spanish occupation, the Cabiao heroes participated in the declaration of Philippine Republic in Malolos on January 23, 1899.\nDuring the Philippine\u2013American War, Cabiao was one of the fiercely battled terrains of the American forces in pursuit of General Aguinaldo\u2019s Forces however most of the populated areas of Cabiao have been saved from the encounter. General Pio del Pilar hold out in the marshes of San Vicente and Santa Rita to delay the intruding Forces of General Elwell Stephen Otis under the command of General Henry Ware Lawton.\n\nIn 1903, the Americans established schools in Cabiao and used the English language as a medium of instructions. Pedro Oreta was elected as the first chief executive of the town under American civil regime followed by the then Mun. President Jose Crespo who established and organized the Presidencia (township hierarchy and organizational plan) constituting the different executive department of the municipality. American occupation in Cabiao has not been as cruel as their Spanish predecessor, however, the people of Cabiao were already afraid to trust the new colonizer. Thomasites missionaries arrived in Cabiao in the early part of 1902 as a part of educating the people of Cabiao and in 1903, the Americans established schools in Cabiao and used the English language as the medium of instruction. Some rural folks used to study individually in the Spanish methods of learning on arithmetic and reading in their native tongue Tagalog.\n\nFrom 1907-1909, Cabiao was placed under jurisdiction of San Isidro and the executive power was then held by the Municipal President of San Isidro. It was in the term of Office of Municipal President Gonzalo Del Leon that the seat of Municipal Town Hall was erected on the land donated by the Romero family. It was during the term of Jose Lapuz that Judge Bonifacio Ysip was elected as delegate to the constitutional convention held in Manila.\n\nAfter almost three decades of peace, Japan invaded the Philippines, and the people of Cabiao once again play an important role in the liberation of our country, HUKBALAHAP (Hukbo ng Bayan Laban sa Hapon) or People\u2019s Anti-Japanese Army, was then established in Sitio Bawit, San Julian, Cabiao on March 29, 1942. When the Allies between the combined U.S. and Filipino troops finally liberated the Philippines and as soon as the Central Government was established in Manila, Mariano Guevarra was appointed Mayor of Cabiao.  He was the chief executive of the town in 1945.  Prudencio Ortiz Luis succeeded Guevarra who occupies the position for only a few months.  In later part of 1945 after the liberation, most of the people of Cabiao were still in the far flung areas of Cambabalu, Saclang Capampangan, Saclang Tagalog and Dumanas and it was during this time that the mayor of this town has been appointed by then President Manuel Roxas by the name of Ambrosio Aligada. He was appointed as the Chief Executive of the town from 1945-1947. The town of Cabiao was placed under the military government under Pablo Aligada.  It was also during the time of Aligada that the Sitio of Palasinan (presently San Gregorio) comprising the property owned by Don Ramon Fernandez were repopulated by the people coming from said the places whereas the area of Bagong Silang were repopulate by the people coming from Buliran, Guyong-guyong, Luyos of which most of them are Tagalogs. The people of Cabiao were governed by Aligada through coercive and dictatorial rule that is being manifested by the force labor construction of the Cabiao High School which is the monumental relic of his tenure. Isaias Manalastas seated as the progressive mayor through the support HUKBALAHAPs that during that time is at its height from which they fielded their party named Prente Popular however it did not last long due to the suspicion of the military of an imminent grabbing of power where these party is the political front of the Huks. Nieves Pablo, a woman, was the fourth appointed mayor in that same year.\n\nIt was also the time when the height of the Huk uprising began when the entire town was the seat of the rebellion, where the 50,000 armed group was inducted in Bawit and in Pasong Diablo only to be captured en masse by the then late General Ismael Lapus through the order of Secretary Magsaysay and the clearing of the entire forested area of Bagong Sikat and Santa Isabel had begun purposely to eliminate the lair of the Huk rebels. The health center were constructed through the financial support of Defense Secretary Castelo Justice Secretary Hermogenes Concepcion and Do\u00f1a Maria Romero Buencamino (who was at that time the richest family and the most influential).\n\nYear 1950, when the 1st tenure of then Paterno Santiano began, the towns public market was constructed through the support of the national government since the towns income cannot at that time support such huge amount of expenditures.\n \nIt was the 1st tenure of Gregorio T. Crespo, when the old town hall was renovated and the original Cabiao Central School Building has been restored. The gravelling of Sinipit -San Roque Road was made.

The abundance of sugar during the pre-Spanish era is evident in a wide area of kabyaw including the area going to the foot of Mount Arayat. The kabyawan became familiar to the neighboring places due to the concentration of kabyawan in the place where it was located and was identified as Kabyawan and later shortened to \"Kabyaw\" and eventually altered the spelling due to the influence of the foreign alphabet letters. The used of kabyawan then is prevalent among the natives constituting mainly the ancient tribes of tagalogs that hails from Bulacan and capampangan of which they came in waves of migration from mainland Malay origin as evident from their language similarity.\nThe Kabyawan tools might have been brought by the exploring Malays and later improved by the natives settling in the island of Luzon however there are findings that most of the antiquated wooden kabyawan tools at present can be found in Ilocos where the early Sumatran and Melanesian explorers had embarked earlier than the Malays. Similarly, during that period, the natives of the mountain province whose origin is from mainland China might have been the one responsible in introducing the said crushing tools which we know now as the KABYAWAN. The settlement that has been known as Sinipit, Palasinan, Pantalan, Pinaglamoan, Kandumpa, Kambabalo, Longalong, Mayayade, Tinalan, Makabaklay, Saklang and Palanas were words and terms taken from Malay and the tribal dialect in existence during that period.\nCabiao as termed today was a just balangay of the once prosperous of empire of the campampangan settlement named Candaba, as it was discovered by the exploring Spanish conquistadores in 1590. The visita of Cabiao was perhaps established somewhere between 1765 and 1767 by the Jesuit Missionary before they were sent back to Spain under the order of King Charles III of Spain to recall all the Society of Jesus religious order to return to Spain thereby banishing them from all the Spanish dominions. Cabiao gain its full township of Pampanga in 1797 under the term of Governor General Rafael Maria de Aguilar y Ponce de Leon* with the recommendation of the returning order of the Augustinian in the Province of Pampanga and elevates the Visita of St. John Nepomucene that was established by the Jesuits into a regular Parish Church. It was established as one of the municipality of Nueva Ecija on February 9, 1848 upon the order issued by Governor General Narciso Claveria Y Zaldua and upon the recommendation made by the Governor General Marcelino Oraa. \nThe growth of Cabiao during that time maybe attributed to its vast marsh and inland water that serves as inland fishery of the area. The Poblacion comprising the three pillars of Spanish governance of the Spaniard namely the Casa Municipal, Casa dela Iglesia and Casa Judicial were erected in 1838 under the term of Don Josef Kabigting as the Gobernadorcillo (the present location of the church, the central school and the intervening residential area between the central school and the church).\n\nThe desire of the populace of Cabiao to be free from Spanish domination and tyranny resulted in the uprising on September 2, 1896. Numbering around 700 men (461 listed in the Tablet of Heroes in the Municipal Compound), the townsfolk of Cabiao and the Cabiao Brass Band under the leadership of their Capitan Municipal Mariano Nu\u00f1ez Llanera together with the people of the neighboring towns of Arayat, Deliquente (San Antonio) & Jaen led the siege against the colonizing Spaniards stationed at the Factoria of San Isidro. This event was marked as the First Cry of Nueva Ecija. It did not take too long that the Spanish Colonial Government, succumbed to cede the Archipelago of Philippines to the United States on December 10, 1898 that brought about the Treaty of Paris, and once again the Philippines was under colonial rule this time by the American. In the last days of the Spanish occupation, the Cabiao heroes participated in the declaration of Philippine Republic in Malolos on January 23, 1899.\nDuring the Philippine\u2013American War, Cabiao was one of the fiercely battled terrains of the American forces in pursuit of General Aguinaldo\u2019s Forces however most of the populated areas of Cabiao have been saved from the encounter. General Pio del Pilar hold out in the marshes of San Vicente and Santa Rita to delay the intruding Forces of General Elwell Stephen Otis under the command of General Henry Ware Lawton.\n\nIn 1903, the Americans established schools in Cabiao and used the English language as a medium of instructions. Pedro Oreta was elected as the first chief executive of the town under American civil regime followed by the then Mun. President Jose Crespo who established and organized the Presidencia (township hierarchy and organizational plan) constituting the different executive department of the municipality. American occupation in Cabiao has not been as cruel as their Spanish predecessor, however, the people of Cabiao were already afraid to trust the new colonizer. Thomasites missionaries arrived in Cabiao in the early part of 1902 as a part of educating the people of Cabiao and in 1903, the Americans established schools in Cabiao and used the English language as the medium of instruction. Some rural folks used to study individually in the Spanish methods of learning on arithmetic and reading in their native tongue Tagalog.\n\nFrom 1907-1909, Cabiao was placed under jurisdiction of San Isidro and the executive power was then held by the Municipal President of San Isidro. It was in the term of Office of Municipal President Gonzalo Del Leon that the seat of Municipal Town Hall was erected on the land donated by the Romero family. It was during the term of Jose Lapuz that Judge Bonifacio Ysip was elected as delegate to the constitutional convention held in Manila.\n\nAfter almost three decades of peace, Japan invaded the Philippines, and the people of Cabiao once again play an important role in the liberation of our country, HUKBALAHAP (Hukbo ng Bayan Laban sa Hapon) or People\u2019s Anti-Japanese Army, was then established in Sitio Bawit, San Julian, Cabiao on March 29, 1942. When the Allies between the combined U.S. and Filipino troops finally liberated the Philippines and as soon as the Central Government was established in Manila, Mariano Guevarra was appointed Mayor of Cabiao.  He was the chief executive of the town in 1945.  Prudencio Ortiz Luis succeeded Guevarra who occupies the position for only a few months.  In later part of 1945 after the liberation, most of the people of Cabiao were still in the far flung areas of Cambabalu, Saclang Capampangan, Saclang Tagalog and Dumanas and it was during this time that the mayor of this town has been appointed by then President Manuel Roxas by the name of Ambrosio Aligada. He was appointed as the Chief Executive of the town from 1945-1947. The town of Cabiao was placed under the military government under Pablo Aligada.  It was also during the time of Aligada that the Sitio of Palasinan (presently San Gregorio) comprising the property owned by Don Ramon Fernandez were repopulated by the people coming from said the places whereas the area of Bagong Silang were repopulate by the people coming from Buliran, Guyong-guyong, Luyos of which most of them are Tagalogs. The people of Cabiao were governed by Aligada through coercive and dictatorial rule that is being manifested by the force labor construction of the Cabiao High School which is the monumental relic of his tenure. Isaias Manalastas seated as the progressive mayor through the support HUKBALAHAPs that during that time is at its height from which they fielded their party named Prente Popular however it did not last long due to the suspicion of the military of an imminent grabbing of power where these party is the political front of the Huks. Nieves Pablo, a woman, was the fourth appointed mayor in that same year.\n\nIt was also the time when the height of the Huk uprising began when the entire town was the seat of the rebellion, where the 50,000 armed group was inducted in Bawit and in Pasong Diablo only to be captured en masse by the then late General Ismael Lapus through the order of Secretary Magsaysay and the clearing of the entire forested area of Bagong Sikat and Santa Isabel had begun purposely to eliminate the lair of the Huk rebels. The health center were constructed through the financial support of Defense Secretary Castelo Justice Secretary Hermogenes Concepcion and Do\u00f1a Maria Romero Buencamino (who was at that time the richest family and the most influential).\n\nYear 1950, when the 1st tenure of then Paterno Santiano began, the towns public market was constructed through the support of the national government since the towns income cannot at that time support such huge amount of expenditures.\n \nIt was the 1st tenure of Gregorio T. Crespo, when the old town hall was renovated and the original Cabiao Central School Building has been restored. The gravelling of Sinipit -San Roque Road was made. Mayor Paterno Santiano reassumed his post as a mayor after a very much contested election results.\n\nIn 1960, Crespo reassumed his post as Mayor of Cabiao, and Pedro T. Wycoco was appointed as the Chief of Police. The Gapan- Arayat Road, Cabiao Section were constructed by Golangco Construction and Development Corp. in 1963.\n\nIn 1979 the town's Public Market was rehabilitated through the help of the member of the Parliament Angel Concepcion for which main building was constructed contiguously from the previous two small one. The town of Cabiao was governed by Mayor Crespo for almost three decades bringing together town folks of Cabiao to be one living in peace and serves as the legacy for which Mayor Crespo was known.\n\nThe EDSA Revolution of 1986, was the year when Mayor Crespo was dislodged by the appointment of Atty. Antonio Ll. Lapuz as Officer in Charge of Cabiao. During his tenure, the inception of the municipal development planning were made, and listing of priority projects were categorized, however fundings for these infrastructure were no longer made in his tenure because it had lasted only for two and half years.\n\nAtty. Lapuz was succeeded by Eng\u2019r. Ireneo Manahan, who bested in the three-way election fight during that time, followed the pattern and plans which Atty. Lapuz had laid before he left office. He continued in building roads, barangay health, and brgy. hall including the renovation of the municipal town hall. It was also during that time, that the Santa Isabel- Bagong Sikat Bridge has been initially built however due to the insufficiency of funds the said bridge has not been finished during his tenure. He had also built a community under his name which later name as Manahan Village.\n\nIn his last term of office, mayor Manahan endorsed councilor Gloria Baby Crespo Congco as his successor, the eldest daughter of former Mayor Gregorio Crespo and was elected mayor of the municipality in 1998.  She is the youngest and the first woman to be elected chief executive of the town.  She was also re-elected in the elections of 2001 and 2004.\n\nThe incumbent mayor is Ramil B. Rivera who defeated Gloria Crespo Congco during the 2016 election.\n\nDuring their term, economic performance of Cabiao become robust and rapidly growth. He received Certipicate of Most Outstanding Mayors of the Philippines 2017 and 2018. Golden Globe awards for Cosmopolitan Filipino Achiever of Civil Service 2018. Certipicate of Good Local Governance 2017 and 2018.\n\n==Economy==\nCabiao's economy is one of the fastest growing in the province of [[Nueva Ecija]] and lead as one of the most competitive municipalities in entire [[Central Luzon]] region according to the [[National Competitiveness Council (Philippines)]]Cities/Municipalities Competitiveness Index 2018.

He is considered one of the greatest representatives of the ''[[fin de si\u00e8cle]]'' in international and [[French poetry]]. \n\n==Biography==\n\n\n===Early life===\nBorn in [[Metz]], Verlaine was educated at the ''Lyc\u00e9e Imp\u00e9rial Bonaparte'' (now the [[Lyc\u00e9e Condorcet]]) in Paris and then took up a post in the [[civil service]]. He began writing poetry at an early age, and was initially influenced by the [[Parnassien]] movement and its leader, [[Leconte de Lisle]]. Verlaine's first published poem was published in 1863 in ''La Revue du progr\u00e8s'', a publication founded by poet [[Louis-Xavier de Ricard]]. Verlaine was a frequenter of the salon of the Marquise de Ricard<ref>Shapiro, Norman R., ''One Hundred and One Poems by Paul Verlaine'', University of Chicago Press, 1999</ref> (Louis-Xavier de Ricard's mother) at 10 Boulevard des Batignolles and other social venues, where he rubbed shoulders with prominent artistic figures of the day: [[Anatole France]], [[Emmanuel Chabrier]], inventor-poet and humorist [[Charles Cros]], the cynical anti-bourgeois idealist [[Villiers de l'Isle-Adam]], [[Th\u00e9odore de Banville]], [[Fran\u00e7ois Copp\u00e9e]], [[Jose-Maria de Heredia]], Leconte de Lisle, [[Catulle Mendes]] and others.

At the proclamation of the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]] in the same year, Verlaine joined the 160th battalion of the ''[[National Guard (France)|Garde nationale]]'', turning [[Communards|Communard]] on 18 March 1871.\n\nHe became head of the press bureau of the Central Committee of the [[Paris Commune]]. Verlaine escaped the deadly street fighting known as the Bloody Week, or ''Semaine Sanglante'', and went into hiding in the Pas-de-Calais.\n\n===Relationships with Rimbaud and L\u00e9tinois===\n[[File:Arthur Rimbaud plaque.JPG|thumb|right|Plaque in [[Brussels]]]]\n[[File:Paul Verlaine.jpeg|thumb|Paul Verlaine in 1893; photograph by [[Otto Wegener]]]]\nVerlaine returned to Paris in August 1871, and, in September, he received the first letter from [[Arthur Rimbaud]], who admired his poetry. He urged Rimbaud to come to Paris, and by 1872, he had lost interest in Mathilde, and effectively abandoned her and their son, preferring the company of his new lover.<ref name=litweb /> Rimbaud and Verlaine's stormy affair took them to London in 1872.  In Brussels in July 1873 in a drunken, jealous rage, he fired two shots with a pistol at Rimbaud, wounding his left wrist, though not seriously injuring the poet.

''Romances sans paroles'' was published while Verlaine was imprisoned.

In a similar vein, Verlaine used the expression ''[[po\u00e8te maudit]]'' (\"cursed poet\") in 1884 to refer to a number of poets like [[St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9]], [[Arthur Rimbaud]], [[Aloysius Bertrand]], [[Comte de Lautr\u00e9amont]], [[Tristan Corbi\u00e8re]] or [[Alice de Chambrier]], who had fought against poetic conventions and suffered social rebuke or were ignored by the critics. But with the publication of [[Jean Mor\u00e9as]]' ''[[Symbolist Manifesto]]'' in 1886, it was the term [[symbolism (arts)|symbolism]] which was most often applied to the new literary environment. Along with Verlaine, Mallarm\u00e9, Rimbaud, [[Paul Val\u00e9ry]], [[Albert Samain]] and many others began to be referred to as \"Symbolists.\" These poets would often share themes that parallel [[Schopenhauer's aesthetics]] and notions of will, fatality and [[Unconscious mind|unconscious forces]], and used themes of sex (such as [[Prostitution|prostitutes]]), the city, irrational phenomena ([[delirium]], dreams, [[narcotic]]s, alcohol), and sometimes a vaguely [[Middle Ages|medieval]] setting.\n\nIn poetry, the symbolist procedure&mdash;as typified by Verlaine&mdash;was to use subtle suggestion instead of precise statement ([[rhetoric]] was banned) and to evoke moods and feelings through the magic of words and repeated sounds and the cadence of verse (musicality) and [[Meter (poetry)|metrical]] innovation.\n\nVerlaine described his typically decadent style in great detail in his poem \"Art Po\u00e9tique,\" describing the primacy of musicality and the importance of elusiveness and \"the Odd.\"  He spoke of veils and nuance and implored poets to \"Keep away from the murderous Sharp Saying, Cruel Wit, and Impure Laugh.\"  It is with these lyrical veils in mind that he concluded by suggesting that a poem should be a \"happy occurrence.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.aestheticrealism.net/poetry/art-poetique.htm|title=Art Po\u00e9tique|last=Verlane|first=Paul|date=1882|website=Aesthetic Realism Online Library|others=Translated by Eli Siegel (1968)|access-date=18 February 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Portraits==\nNumerous artists painted Verlaine's portrait.

However, the people's love for his art was able to resurrect support and bring in an income for Verlaine: his early poetry was rediscovered, his lifestyle and strange behaviour in front of crowds attracted admiration, and in 1894 he was elected France's \"Prince of Poets\" by his peers.\n\nHis poetry was admired and recognized as ground-breaking, and served as a source of inspiration to composers. [[Gabriel Faur\u00e9]] composed many [[m\u00e9lodie]]s, such as the [[song cycle]]s ''[[Cinq m\u00e9lodies \"de Venise\"]]'' and ''[[La bonne chanson (Faur\u00e9)|La bonne chanson]]'', which were settings of Verlaine's poems.<ref>{{Cite book | last=Orledge | first=Robert | title=Gabriel Faur\u00e9 | publisher=Eulenburg Books | location=London | year=1979 | page=[https://archive.org/details/gabrielfaur0000orle/page/78 78] | isbn=0-903873-40-0 | url=https://archive.org/details/gabrielfaur0000orle/page/78 }}</ref> [[Claude Debussy]] set to music  ''[[Clair de lune (poem)|Clair de lune]]'' and six of the ''F\u00eates galantes'' poems, forming part of the ''m\u00e9lodie'' collection known as the ''Recueil Vasnier''; he also made another setting of Clair de lune, and the poem inspired his [[Suite bergamasque]].<ref name=\"Forgotten Songs CD\">Rolf, Marie.

In a similar vein, Verlaine used the expression ''[[po\u00e8te maudit]]'' (\"cursed poet\") in 1884 to refer to a number of poets like [[St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9]], [[Arthur Rimbaud]], [[Aloysius Bertrand]], [[Comte de Lautr\u00e9amont]], [[Tristan Corbi\u00e8re]] or [[Alice de Chambrier]], who had fought against poetic conventions and suffered social rebuke or were ignored by the critics. But with the publication of [[Jean Mor\u00e9as]]' ''[[Symbolist Manifesto]]'' in 1886, it was the term [[symbolism (arts)|symbolism]] which was most often applied to the new literary environment. Along with Verlaine, Mallarm\u00e9, Rimbaud, [[Paul Val\u00e9ry]], [[Albert Samain]] and many others began to be referred to as \"Symbolists.\" These poets would often share themes that parallel [[Schopenhauer's aesthetics]] and notions of will, fatality and [[Unconscious mind|unconscious forces]], and used themes of sex (such as [[Prostitution|prostitutes]]), the city, irrational phenomena ([[delirium]], dreams, [[narcotic]]s, alcohol), and sometimes a vaguely [[Middle Ages|medieval]] setting.\n\nIn poetry, the symbolist procedure&mdash;as typified by Verlaine&mdash;was to use subtle suggestion instead of precise statement ([[rhetoric]] was banned) and to evoke moods and feelings through the magic of words and repeated sounds and the cadence of verse (musicality) and [[Meter (poetry)|metrical]] innovation.\n\nVerlaine described his typically decadent style in great detail in his poem \"Art Po\u00e9tique,\" describing the primacy of musicality and the importance of elusiveness and \"the Odd.\"  He spoke of veils and nuance and implored poets to \"Keep away from the murderous Sharp Saying, Cruel Wit, and Impure Laugh.\"  It is with these lyrical veils in mind that he concluded by suggesting that a poem should be a \"happy occurrence.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.aestheticrealism.net/poetry/art-poetique.htm|title=Art Po\u00e9tique|last=Verlane|first=Paul|date=1882|website=Aesthetic Realism Online Library|others=Translated by Eli Siegel (1968)|access-date=18 February 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Portraits==\nNumerous artists painted Verlaine's portrait.
