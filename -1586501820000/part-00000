The Greek geographer [[Ptolemy]] had already written of two Baltic tribe/nations by name, the [[Galindians#Western Galindians|Galindai]] and [[Sudovians|Sudinoi]] (\u0393\u03b1\u03bb\u03af\u03bd\u03b4\u03b1\u03b9, \u03a3\u03bf\u03c5\u03b4\u03b9\u03bd\u03bf\u03af) in the 2nd century AD. The differentiation between Lithuanian and [[Latvian language|Latvian]] started after 800; for a long period, they could be considered dialects of a single language. At a minimum, transitional dialects existed until the 14th or 15th century and perhaps as late as the 17th century. Also, the 13th- and 14th-century occupation of the western part of the [[Daugava River|Daugava]] basin (closely coinciding with the territory of modern [[Latvia]]) by the [[German people|German]] [[Livonian Brothers of the Sword|Sword Brethren]] had a significant influence on the languages' independent development.\n\nThe earliest surviving written Lithuanian text is a translation dating from about 1503\u20131525 of the [[Lord's Prayer]], the [[Hail Mary]], and the [[Nicene Creed]] written in the Southern Auk\u0161taitian dialect. Printed books existed after 1547, but the level of literacy among Lithuanians was low through the 18th century, and books were not commonly available. In 1864, following the [[January Uprising]], [[Mikhail Nikolayevich Muravyov-Vilensky|Mikhail Muravyov]], the Russian [[Governor General of Lithuania]], banned the language in education and publishing [[Lithuanian press ban|and barred use of the Latin alphabet]] altogether, although books printed in Lithuanian continued to be printed across the border in [[East Prussia]] and in the [[United States]]. Brought into the country by [[Lithuanian book smugglers|book smugglers]] ({{lang-lt|knygne\u0161iai|links=no}}) despite the threat of stiff prison sentences, they helped fuel a [[Lithuanian National Revival|growing nationalist sentiment]] that finally led to the lifting of the ban in 1904.\n\n[[Jonas Jablonskis]] (1860\u20131930) made significant contributions to the formation of the standard Lithuanian language. The conventions of written Lithuanian had been evolving during the 19th century, but Jablonskis, in the introduction to his ''Lietuvi\u0161kos kalbos gramatika'', was the first to formulate and expound the essential principles that were so indispensable to its later development. His proposal for Standard Lithuanian was based on his native [[Suvalkija|Western Auk\u0161taitija]]n dialect with some features of the eastern [[Prussian Lithuanians]]' dialect spoken in [[Lithuania Minor]]. These dialects{{clarify|date=November 2014}}<!--Which dialects?

Some theories, such as that of [[J\u0101nis Endzel\u012bns]], considered that the Baltic languages form their own distinct branch of the family of [[Indo-European languages]]. There is also an opinion that suggests the union of Baltic and Slavic languages into a distinct sub-family of [[Balto-Slavic languages]] amongst the Indo-European family of languages. Such an opinion was first represented by the likes of [[August Schleicher]]{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}, and to a certain extent, [[Antoine Meillet]]{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}. Endzel\u012bns thought that the similarity between Baltic and Slavic was explicable through language contact while Schleicher, Meillet and others argued for a genetic kinship between the two families.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nAn attempt to reconcile the opposing stances was made by [[Jan Micha\u0142 Rozwadowski]]. He proposed that the two language groups were indeed a unity after the division of Indo-European, but also suggested that after the two had divided into separate entities (Baltic and Slavic), they had posterior contact. The genetic kinship view is augmented by the fact that Proto-Balto-Slavic is easily reconstructible with important proofs in historic prosody. The alleged (or certain, as certain as historic linguistics can be) similarities due to contact are seen in such phenomena as the existence of definite adjectives formed by the addition of an inflected pronoun (descended from the same Proto-Indo-European pronoun), which exist in both Baltic and Slavic yet nowhere else in the Indo-European family (languages such as Albanian and the [[Germanic languages]] developed definite adjectives independently), and that are not reconstructible for Proto-Balto-Slavic, meaning that they most probably developed through language contact. {{citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\nThe Baltic [[hydronym]]s area stretches from the [[Vistula]] River in the west to the east of [[Moscow]] and from the [[Baltic Sea]] in the north to the south of [[Kiev]].<ref>{{cite book|last= Mallory; Adams|first = J.

There are significant differences between standard Lithuanian and Samogitian and these were often described as separate languages. The modern Samogitian dialect formed in the 13th\u201316th centuries under the influence of the [[Curonian language]]. Lithuanian dialects are closely connected with [[regions of Lithuania|ethnographical regions of Lithuania]].\n\nDialects are divided into subdialects. Both dialects have three subdialects. Samogitian is divided into West, North and South; Auk\u0161taitian into West (Suvalkie\u010diai), [[Dz\u016bkian|South (Dz\u016bkai)]] and East.\n\nStandard Lithuanian is derived mostly from Western Auk\u0161taitian dialects, including the Eastern dialect of [[Lithuania Minor]]. Influence of other dialects is more significant in the vocabulary of standard Lithuanian.\n\n==Script==\n{{IPA notice}}\n{{main|Lithuanian orthography}}\n{{see also|Lithuanian Braille}}\nLithuanian uses the [[Latin script]] supplemented with [[diacritic]]s. It has 32 [[Letter (alphabet)|letters]]. In the [[collation]] order, ''y'' follows immediately after ''\u012f'' (called ''i [[ogonek|nosin\u0117]]''), because both ''y'' and ''\u012f'' represent the same long vowel {{IPAblink|i\u02d0}}:\n\n{|class=wikitable style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"32\"|[[Capital letters|Majuscule forms]] (also called '''uppercase''' or '''capital letters''')\n|-\n| A || \u0104 || B || C || \u010c || D || E || \u0118\n| \u0116 || F || G || H || I || \u012e || Y || J\n| K || L || M || N || O || P || R || S\n| \u0160 || T || U || \u0172 || \u016a || V || Z || \u017d\n|-\n! colspan=\"32\"|[[Lower case|Minuscule forms]] (also called '''lowercase''' or '''small letters''')\n|-\n| a || \u0105 || b || c || \u010d || d || e || \u0119\n| \u0117 || f || g || h || i || \u012f || y || j\n| k || l || m || n || o || p || r || s\n| \u0161 || t || u || \u0173 || \u016b || v || z || \u017e\n|}\n\nIn addition, the following digraphs are used, but are treated as sequences of two letters for collation purposes. The digraph ''ch'' represents a single sound, the velar fricative {{IPAblink|x}}, while ''dz'' and ''d\u017e'' are pronounced like straightforward combinations of their component letters (sounds):\n\nDz dz {{IPAblink|dz}} (dz\u0117), D\u017e d\u017e {{IPAblink|d\u0292}} (d\u017e\u0117), Ch ch {{IPAblink|x}} (cha).\n\nThe Lithuanian writing system is largely phonemic, i.e., one letter usually corresponds to a single [[phoneme]] (sound). There are a few exceptions: for example, the letter ''i'' represents either the vowel {{IPAblink|\u026a}}, as in the English ''sit'', or is silent and merely indicates that the preceding consonant is [[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatalized]]. The latter is largely the case when ''i'' occurs after a consonant and is followed by a [[Back vowel|back]] or a [[central vowel]], except in some borrowed words (e.g., the first consonant in ''l\u016bpa'' {{IPA|[\u02c8'''\u026b'''\u00fb\u02d0p\u0250]}}, \"lip\", is a [[Velarized alveolar lateral approximant|velarized dental lateral approximant]]; on the other hand, the first consonant in ''li\u016btas'' {{IPA|[\u02c8'''l\u02b2'''u\u02d0t\u032a\u0250s\u032a]}}, \"lion\", is a palatalized [[alveolar lateral approximant]]; both consonants are followed by the same vowel, the long {{IPAblink|u\u02d0}}, and no {{IPAblink|\u026a}} can be pronounced in ''li\u016btas''). Before the 20th century, due to the [[Lithuanian press ban]], Lithuanian alphabet included the Polish \u0141 for the first sound and regular L (without a following i) for the second: ''\u0142upa'', ''lutas''.\n\nA [[Macron (diacritic)|macron]] (on ''u''), an [[ogonek]] (on ''a'', ''e'', ''i'', and ''u''), and ''y'' (in place of ''i'') are used for grammatical and historical reasons and always denote [[vowel length]] in Modern Standard Lithuanian. [[Acute accent|Acute]], [[Grave accent|grave]], and [[tilde]] diacritics are used to indicate [[pitch accent]]s. However, these pitch accents are generally not written, except in dictionaries, grammars, and where needed for clarity, such as to differentiate homonyms and dialectal use.\n\n==Phonology==\n{{main|Lithuanian phonology}}\n\n===Consonants===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+ Consonant phonemes of Lithuanian\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"2\"|&nbsp;\n! colspan=\"2\"|[[Labial consonant|Labial]]\n! colspan=\"2\"|[[Dental consonant|Dental]]\n! colspan=\"2\"|[[Alveolar consonant|Alveolar]]\n! rowspan=\"2\"|[[Palatal consonant|Palatal]]\n! colspan=\"2\"|[[Velar consonant|Velar]]\n|- style=\"font-size:small;\"\n! hard\n! soft\n! hard\n! soft\n! hard\n! soft\n! hard\n! soft\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\"|[[Nasal consonant|Nasal]]\n| {{IPA link|m}} || {{IPA|m\u02b2}}\n| {{IPA link|n\u032a|n}} || {{IPA|n\u02b2}}\n| \n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\"|[[Stop consonant|Stop]]\n! {{small|voiceless}}\n| {{IPA link|p}} || {{IPA|p\u02b2}}\n| {{IPA link|t\u032a|t}} || {{IPA|t\u02b2}}\n|\n|\n|\n| {{IPA|k}} || {{IPA link|k\u02b2}}\n|-\n! {{small|voiced}}\n| {{IPA link|b}} || {{IPA|b\u02b2}}\n| {{IPA link|d\u032a|d}} || {{IPA|d\u02b2}}\n|\n|\n|\n| {{IPA|\u0261}} || {{IPA link|\u0261\u02b2}}\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\"|[[Affricate consonant|Affricate]]\n! {{small|voiceless}}\n| colspan=\"2\"|&nbsp;\n| {{IPA link|t\u032a\u0361s\u032a|t\u0361s}} || {{IPA|t\u0361s\u02b2}}\n| {{IPA link|t\u0361\u0283}} || {{IPA link|t\u0361\u0255}}\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! {{small|voiced}}\n| colspan=\"2\"|&nbsp;\n| {{IPA link|d\u032a\u0361z\u032a|d\u0361z}} || {{IPA|d\u0361z\u02b2}}\n| {{IPA link|d\u0361\u0292}} || {{IPA link|d\u0361\u0291}}\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\"|[[Fricative consonant|Fricative]]\n! {{small|voiceless}}\n| ({{IPA link|f}}) || ({{IPA|f\u02b2}})\n| {{IPA link|s\u032a|s}} || {{IPA|s\u02b2}}\n| {{IPA link|\u0283}} || {{IPA link|\u0255}}\n|\n| ({{IPA|x}}) || ({{IPA link|x\u02b2}})\n|-\n! {{small|voiced}}\n| rowspan=\"2\"|{{IPA|v}} || rowspan=\"2\"|{{IPA|v\u02b2}}\n| {{IPA link|z\u032a|z}} || {{IPA|z\u02b2}}\n| {{IPA link|\u0292}} || {{IPA link|\u0291}}\n| rowspan=\"2\"|{{IPA|j}}\n| ({{IPA|\u0263}}) || ({{IPA link|\u0263\u02b2}})\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\"|[[Approximant consonant|Approximant]]\n| {{IPA link|\u026b\u032a|\u026b}}\n|\n| \n| {{IPA link|l|l\u02b2}}\n| ||\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\"|[[Trill consonant|Trill]]\n| colspan=\"2\"|&nbsp;\n| colspan=\"2\"|&nbsp;\n| {{IPA link|r}} || {{IPA|r\u02b2}}\n|\n|\n|\n|}\n\nAll Lithuanian consonants except {{IPA|/j/}} have two variants: the non-[[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatalized]] one represented by the [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] symbols in the chart, and the [[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatalized]] one (i.e. {{IPA|/b/}}&nbsp;\u2013 {{IPA|/b\u02b2/}}, {{IPA|/d/}}&nbsp;\u2013 {{IPA|/d\u02b2/}}, {{IPA|/\u0261/}}&nbsp;\u2013 {{IPA|/\u0261\u02b2/}}, and so on).

Its accentuation is sometimes described as a simple [[tone (linguistics)|tone]] system, often called [[pitch accent]].<ref name=tone>''Phonetic invariance and phonological stability: Lithuanian pitch accents'' Grzegorz Dogil & Gregor M\u00f6hler, 1998 [http://eprints.kfupm.edu.sa/57901/]{{dead link|date=February 2014}}</ref> In [[lexical word]]s, one syllable will be tonically prominent. A [[heavy syllable]]\u2014that is, a syllable containing a [[long vowel]], [[diphthong]], or a [[sonorant]] coda\u2014may have one of two tones, ''falling tone'' (or ''acute tone'') or ''rising tone'' (or ''circumflex tone''). Light syllables (syllables with short vowels and optionally also [[obstruent]] codas) do not have the two-way contrast of heavy syllables.\n\n==Grammar==\n{{Main|Lithuanian grammar}}\nLithuanian is a highly [[inflected language]]. In Lithuanian, there are two [[grammatical gender]]s for nouns&nbsp;\u2013 masculine and feminine, and there are three genders for adjectives, pronouns, numerals and participles: masculine, feminine and neuter. Every attribute has to follow the gender and the number of the noun. The neuter forms of other parts of speech are used with a [[Subject (grammar)|subject]] of an undefined gender (a pronoun, an infinitive etc.).\n\nThere are twelve [[noun]] and five [[adjective]] [[declension]]s and one (masculine and feminine) participle declension.<ref>Dabartin\u0117s lietuvi\u0173 kalbos gramatika. Vilnius, 1997</ref>\n\nNouns and other parts of nominal morphology are declined in seven cases: [[nominative]], [[genitive]], [[dative]], [[Accusative case|accusative]], [[instrumental case|instrumental]], [[Locative case|locative]], and [[Vocative case|vocative]]. In older Lithuanian texts three additional varieties of the locative case are found: [[Illative case|illative]], [[Adessive case|adessive]] and [[Allative case|allative]]. The most common are the [[Illative case|illative]], which still is used, mostly in spoken language, and the [[Allative case|allative]], which survives in the standard language in some idiomatic usages. The adessive is nearly extinct. These additional cases are probably due to the influence of Uralic languages with which Baltic languages have had a long-standing contact (Uralic languages have a great variety of noun cases, a number of which are specialised locative cases).\n\nThe Lithuanian verbal morphology shows a number of innovations. Namely, the loss of synthetic passive (which is hypothesized based on the more archaic though long-extinct Indo-European languages), synthetic perfect (formed via the means of reduplication) and aorist; forming subjunctive and imperative with the use of suffixes plus flexions as opposed to solely flections in, e. g., Ancient Greek; loss of the optative mood; merging and disappearing of the -t- and -nt- markers for third person singular and plural, respectively (this, however, occurs in Latvian and Old Prussian as well and may indicate a collective feature of all Baltic languages).\n\nOn the other hand, the Lithuanian verbal morphology retains a number of archaic features absent from most modern Indo-European languages (but shared with Latvian). This includes the synthetic formation of the future tense with the help of the -s- suffix; three principal verbal forms with the present tense stem employing the -n- and -st- infixes.\n\nThere are three [[verb]]al [[grammatical conjugation|conjugation]]s. The verb ''b\u016bti'' is the only auxiliary verb in the language. Together with participles, it is used to form dozens of compound forms.\n\nIn the '''active voice''', each verb can be inflected for any of the following [[Grammatical mood|moods]]:\n\n#Indicative\n#Indirect\n#Imperative\n#Conditional/subjunctive\n\nIn the [[indicative mood]] and indirect moods, all verbs can have eleven [[Grammatical tense|tenses]]:\n#simple: [[present tense|present]] (''ne\u0161u''), [[past tense|past]] (''ne\u0161iau''), [[past iterative tense|past iterative]] (''ne\u0161davau'') and [[future tense|future]] (''ne\u0161iu'')\n#compound:\n##present perfect (''esu ne\u0161\u0119s''), past perfect (''buvau ne\u0161\u0119s''), past iterative perfect (''b\u016bdavau ne\u0161\u0119s''), future perfect (''b\u016bsiu ne\u0161\u0119s'')\n##past inchoative (''buvau bene\u0161\u0105s''), past iterative inchoative (''b\u016bdavau bene\u0161\u0105s''), future inchoative (''b\u016bsiu bene\u0161\u0105s'')\n\nThe indirect mood, used only in written narrative speech, has the same tenses corresponding to the appropriate active participle in nominative case, e. g. past of the indirect mood would be ''ne\u0161\u0119s'', past iterative inchoative of the indirect mood would be ''b\u016bdav\u0119s bene\u0161\u0105s''. Since it is a nominal form, this mood cannot be conjugated, but must match the subject's number and gender.\n\nThe [[subjunctive mood|subjunctive]] (or [[conditional mood|conditional]]) <!-- see notes in the discussion page of the Lithuanian grammar--> and the [[imperative mood|imperative]] [[grammatical mood|mood]]s have three tenses. Subjunctive: present (''ne\u0161\u010diau''), past (''b\u016b\u010diau ne\u0161\u0119s''), inchoative (''b\u016b\u010diau bene\u0161\u0105s''); imperative: present (''ne\u0161k''), perfect (''b\u016bk ne\u0161\u0119s'') and inchoative (''b\u016bk bene\u0161\u0105s'').\n\nThe [[infinitive]] has only one form (''ne\u0161ti''). These forms, except the infinitive and indirect mood, are conjugative, having two singular, two plural persons and the third person form common both for plural and singular.\n\nIn the '''passive voice''', the form number is not as rich as in the active voice. There are two types of passive voice in Lithuanian: present participle (type I) ant past participle (type II) (in the examples below types I and II are separated with a slash). They both have the same moods and tenses:\n\n#Indicative mood: [[present tense|present]] (''esu ne\u0161amas/ne\u0161tas''), [[past tense|past]] (''buvau ne\u0161amas/ne\u0161tas''), [[past iterative tense|past iterative]] (''b\u016bdavau ne\u0161amas/ne\u0161tas'') and [[future tense|future]] (''b\u016bsiu ne\u0161amas/ne\u0161tas'')\n#Indirect mood: [[present tense|present]] (''es\u0105s ne\u0161amas/ne\u0161tas''), [[past tense|past]] (''buv\u0119s ne\u0161amas/ne\u0161tas''), [[past iterative tense|past iterative]] (''b\u016bdav\u0119s ne\u0161amas/ne\u0161tas'') and [[future tense|future]] (''b\u016bsi\u0105s ne\u0161amas/ne\u0161tas'').\n#Imperative mood: present (type I only: ''b\u016bk ne\u0161amas''), past (type II only: ''b\u016bk ne\u0161tas'').\n#Subjunctive / conditional mood: present (type I only: ''b\u016b\u010diau ne\u0161amas''), past (type II only: ''b\u016b\u010diau ne\u0161tas'').\n\nLithuanian has the richest [[participle]] system of all Indo-European languages, having participles derived from all simple tenses with distinct active and passive forms, and two gerund forms.\n\nIn practical terms, the rich overall inflectional system makes the word order have a different meaning than in more [[analytic language]]s such as English. The English phrase \"'''a''' car is coming\" translates as \"atva\u017eiuoja automobilis\" (the [[Topic and comment|theme]] first), while \"'''the''' car is coming\" \u2013 \"automobilis atva\u017eiuoja\" (the theme first; word order inversion).\n\nLithuanian also has a very rich word derivation system and an array of diminutive suffixes.\n\nThe first prescriptive grammar book of Lithuanian was commissioned by the Duke of Prussia, Frederick William, for use in the Lithuanian-speaking parishes of East-Prussia. It was written in [[Latin]] and German by [[Daniel Klein (grammarian)|Daniel Klein]] and published in [[K\u00f6nigsberg]] in 1653/1654. The first scientific ''Compendium of Lithuanian language'' was published in German in 1856/57 by [[August Schleicher]], a professor at [[Prague]] University. In it he describes Prussian-Lithuanian which later is to become the \"skeleton\" (B\u016bga) of modern Lithuanian.\n\nToday there are two definitive books on Lithuanian grammar: one in English, the \"Introduction to Modern Lithuanian\" (called \"Beginner's Lithuanian\" in its newer editions) by [[Leonardas Dambri\u016bnas]], [[Antanas Klimas]] and [[William R. Schmalstieg]], and another in Russian, [[Vytautas Ambrazas]]' \"\u0413\u0440\u0430\u043c\u043c\u0430\u0442\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u043b\u0438\u0442\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u044f\u0437\u044b\u043a\u0430\" (\"The Grammar of the Lithuanian Language\"). Another recent book on Lithuanian grammar is the second edition of \"Review of Modern Lithuanian Grammar\" by Edmund Remys, published by Lithuanian Research and Studies Center, Chicago, 2003.\n\n==Vocabulary==\n[[File:Lkz.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|[[Academic Dictionary of Lithuanian|The Grand Dictionary of the Lithuanian language]] consists of 20 volumes and contains more than half a million [[headword]]s]]\n\n===Indo-European vocabulary===\nLithuanian retains [[cognate]]s to many words found in classical languages, such as [[Sanskrit]] and [[Latin language|Latin]]. These words are descended from [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]]. A few examples are the following:\n\n* Lith. and Skt. ''s\u016bnus'' (son)\n* Lith. and Skt. ''avis'' and Lat. ''ovis'' (sheep)\n* Lith. ''d\u016bmas'' and Skt. ''d<sup>h</sup>\u016bmas'' and Lat. ''fumus'' (fumes, smoke)\n* Lith. ''antras'' and Skt. ''antaras'' (second, the other)\n* Lith. ''vilkas'' and Skt. ''v\u1e5bkas'' (wolf)\n* Lith. ''ratas'' and Lat. ''rota'' (wheel) and Skt. ''rat<sup>h</sup>as'' (carriage).\n* Lith. ''senis'' and Lat. ''senex'' (an old man) and Skt. ''sanas'' (old).\n* Lith. ''vyras'' and Lat. ''vir'' (a man) and Skt. ''v\u012bras'' (man).\n* Lith. ''angis'' and Lat. ''anguis'' (a snake in Latin, a species of snakes in Lithuanian)\n* Lith. ''linas'' and Lat. ''linum'' (flax, compare with English 'linen')\n* Lith. ''ariu'' and Lat. ''aro'' (I plow)\n* Lith. ''jungiu'' and Lat. ''iungo'', and Skt. ''yu\u00f1je'' (mid.), (I join)\n* Lith. ''gentys'' and Lat. ''gentes'' and Skt. ''j\u00e1ntis'' (tribes)\n* Lith. ''m\u0117nesis'' and Lat. ''mensis'' and Skt ''masas'' (month)\n* Lith. ''dantis'' and Lat. ''dentes'' and Skt ''dantas'' (teeth)\n* Lith. ''naktis'' and Lat. ''noctes'' and Skt. ''naktis'' (night)\n* Lith. ''ugnis'' and Lat. ''ignis'' and Skt. ''agnis'' (fire)\n* Lith. ''s\u0117dime'' and Lat. ''sedemus'' and Skt. ''s\u012bdamas\u2019\u2019 (we sit)\n\nThis even extends to grammar, where for example Latin noun declensions ending in ''-um'' often correspond to Lithuanian ''-\u0173'', with the [[Latin declension#Fourth declension (u)|Latin]] and [[Lithuanian declension#Table of noun declension endings|Lithuanian fourth declensions]] being particularly close. Many of the words from this list share similarities with other Indo-European languages, including English and Russian. The contribution of Lithuanian was influential in the reconstruction of the [[Proto-Indo-European language]].\n\nLexical and grammatical similarities between Baltic and [[Slavic languages]] suggest an affinity between these two language groups. On the other hand, there exist a number of Baltic (particularly Lithuanian) words without counterparts in Slavic languages, but which are similar to words in Sanskrit or Latin.<!-- Not from the list above. Cf. Russian \u0441\u044b\u043d, \u043e\u0432\u0446\u0430, \u0434\u044b\u043c, \u0432\u043e\u043b\u043a, etc. --> The history of the relationship between Baltic and Slavic languages, and our{{Who|date=June 2019}} understanding of the affinity between the two groups, remain in dispute (see: [[Balto-Slavic languages]]).\n\n===Loanwords===\nIn a 1934 book entitled ''Die Germanismen des Litauischen. Teil I: Die deutschen Lehnw\u00f6rter im Litauischen'', K. Alminauskis found 2,770 loanwords, of which about 130 were of uncertain origin.

The dual persists today in some dialects. Example:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Case !! \"two good friends\"\n|-\n| Nom-Acc || d\u00f9 ger\u00f9 draug\u00f9\n|-\n| Dat || dv\u00edem ger\u00edem draug\u00e1m\n|-\n| Inst || dviem\u0303 geriem\u0303 draugam\u0303\n|}\n\n===Pronunciation===\nThe vowels written ''\u0105, \u0119, \u012f, \u0173'' were still pronounced as long [[nasal vowel]]s,{{sfnp|Ambrazas et al.|1997|p=13}} not as long oral vowels as in today's Lithuanian.\n\nThe original Baltic long ''\u0101'' was still retained as such, e.g. ''bralis'' \"brother\" (modern ''br\u00f3lis'').\n\n===Nouns===\nCompared to the modern language, there were three additional cases, formed under the influence of the [[Finnic languages]]. The original [[locative case]] had been replaced by four so-called ''postpositive'' cases, the [[inessive case]], [[illative case]], [[adessive case]] and [[allative case]], which correspond to the prepositions \"in\", \"into\", \"at\" and \"towards\", respectively. They were formed by affixing a [[postposition]] to one of the previous cases:\n*The inessive added ''-en'' to the original locative.\n*The illative added ''-n(a)'' to the accusative.\n*The adessive added ''-pie'' to the original locative.\n*The allative added ''-pie'' to the genitive.\nThe inessive has become the modern locative case, while the other three have disappeared. Note, however, that the illative case is still used occasionally in the colloquial language (mostly in the singular): ''Lietuvon'' \"to Lithuania\", ''miestan'' \"to the city\". This form is relatively productive: for instance, it is not uncommon to hear \"skrendame Niujork'''an''' (we are flying to New York)\".\n\nThe uncontracted dative plural ''-mus'' was still common.\n\n===Adjectives===\nAdjectives could belong to all four accent classes in Old Lithuanian (now they can only belong to classes 3 and 4).\n\nAdditional remnants of i-stem adjectives still existed, e.g.:\n*loc. sg. ''didim\u00e8 pulk\u00e8'' \"in the big crowd\" (now ''did\u017eiame'')\n*loc. sg. ''ger\u00e8snime'' \"better\" (now ''geresniam\u00e8'')\n*loc. sg. ''ma\u017ei\u00e1usime'' \"smallest\" (now ''ma\u017ei\u00e1usiame'')\n\nAdditional remnants of u-stem adjectives still existed, e.g. ''r\u016bg\u0161t\u00f9s'' \"sour\":\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Case !! Newer !! Older\n|-\n| Inst sg || r\u016bg\u0161\u010di\u00f9 || r\u016bg\u0161tum\u00ec\n|-\n| Loc sg || r\u016bg\u0161\u010diam\u00e8 || r\u016bg\u0161tum\u00e8\n|-\n| Gen pl || r\u016bg\u0161\u010di\u0173\u0303 || r\u016bg\u0161t\u0173\u0303\n|-\n| Acc pl || r\u016b\u0301g\u0161\u010dius || r\u016b\u0301g\u0161tus\n|-\n| Inst pl || r\u016bg\u0161\u010dia\u0129s || r\u016bg\u0161tum\u00ecs\n|}\n\nNo u-stem remnants existed in the dative singular and locative plural.\n\nDefinite adjectives, originally involving a pronoun suffixed to an adjective, had not merged into a single word in Old Lithuanian. Examples:\n*''pa-jo-prasto'' \"ordinary\" (now ''p\u00e0prastojo'')\n*''nu-jie-varg\u0119'' \"tired\" (now ''nuvar\u0303gusieji'')\n\n===Verbs===\nThe [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] class of [[athematic verb]]s still existed in Old Lithuanian:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! &nbsp; !! 'be' !! 'remain' !! 'give' !! 'save'\n|-\n| 1st sg || esm\u00ec || liekm\u00ec || d\u00faomi || g\u00e9lbmi\n|-\n| 2nd sg || es\u00ec || lieks\u00ec || d\u00faosi || g\u00e9lbsi\n|-\n| 3rd sg || \u1ebdst(i) || li\u1ebdkt(i) || d\u00faost(i) || g\u00e9lbt(i)\n|-\n| 1st dual || esv\u00e0 || liekv\u00e0 || d\u00faova || g\u00e9lbva\n|-\n| 2nd dual || est\u00e0 || liekt\u00e0 || d\u00faosta || g\u00e9lbta\n|-\n| 1st pl || esm\u00e8 || liekm\u00e8 || d\u00faome || g\u00e9lbme\n|-\n| 2nd pl || est\u00e8 || liekt\u00e8 || d\u00faoste || g\u00e9lbte\n|-\n| 3rd pl || \u1ebdsti || li\u1ebdkt(i) || d\u00faost(i) || g\u00e9lbt(i)\n|}\n\nThe [[optative mood]] (i.e. the third-person imperative) still had its own endings, ''-ai'' for third-conjugation verbs and ''-ie'' for other verbs, instead of using regular third-person present endings.\n\n===Syntax===\nWord order was freer in Old Lithuanian. For example, a noun in the [[genitive case]] could either precede or follow the noun it modifies.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Lithuanian dictionaries]]\n* [[Martynas Ma\u017evydas]]\n* [[Samogitian dialect]]\n* [[Lithuanian literature]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n* {{Citation\n|last1=Ambrazas\n|first1=Vytautas\n|last2=Geniu\u0161ien\u0117\n|first2=Emma\n|last3=Girdenis\n|first3=Aleksas\n|last4=Sli\u017eien\u0117\n|first4=Nijol\u0117\n|last5=Valeckien\u0117\n|first5=Adel\u0117\n|last6=Valiulyt\u0117\n|first6=Elena\n|last7=Tekorien\u0117\n|first7=Dalija\n|last8=Pa\u017e\u016bsis\n|first8=Lionginas\n|year=1997\n|editor-last=Ambrazas\n|editor-first=Vytautas\n|title=Lithuanian Grammar\n|publisher=Institute of the Lithuanian Language\n|place=Vilnius\n|isbn=9986-813-22-0\n|ref={{harvid|Ambrazas et al.|1997}}\n}}\n* {{SOWL}}\n* Leonardas Dambri\u016bnas, Antanas Klimas, William R.

The Greek geographer [[Ptolemy]] had already written of two Baltic tribe/nations by name, the [[Galindians#Western Galindians|Galindai]] and [[Sudovians|Sudinoi]] (\u0393\u03b1\u03bb\u03af\u03bd\u03b4\u03b1\u03b9, \u03a3\u03bf\u03c5\u03b4\u03b9\u03bd\u03bf\u03af) in the 2nd century AD. The differentiation between Lithuanian and [[Latvian language|Latvian]] started after 800; for a long period, they could be considered dialects of a single language. At a minimum, transitional dialects existed until the 14th or 15th century and perhaps as late as the 17th century. Also, the 13th- and 14th-century occupation of the western part of the [[Daugava River|Daugava]] basin (closely coinciding with the territory of modern [[Latvia]]) by the [[German people|German]] [[Livonian Brothers of the Sword|Sword Brethren]] had a significant influence on the languages' independent development.\n\nThe earliest surviving written Lithuanian text is a translation dating from about 1503\u20131525 of the [[Lord's Prayer]], the [[Hail Mary]], and the [[Nicene Creed]] written in the Southern Auk\u0161taitian dialect. Printed books existed after 1547, but the level of literacy among Lithuanians was low through the 18th century, and books were not commonly available. In 1864, following the [[January Uprising]], [[Mikhail Nikolayevich Muravyov-Vilensky|Mikhail Muravyov]], the Russian [[Governor General of Lithuania]], banned the language in education and publishing [[Lithuanian press ban|and barred use of the Latin alphabet]] altogether, although books printed in Lithuanian continued to be printed across the border in [[East Prussia]] and in the [[United States]]. Brought into the country by [[Lithuanian book smugglers|book smugglers]] ({{lang-lt|knygne\u0161iai|links=no}}) despite the threat of stiff prison sentences, they helped fuel a [[Lithuanian National Revival|growing nationalist sentiment]] that finally led to the lifting of the ban in 1904.\n\n[[Jonas Jablonskis]] (1860\u20131930) made significant contributions to the formation of the standard Lithuanian language. The conventions of written Lithuanian had been evolving during the 19th century, but Jablonskis, in the introduction to his ''Lietuvi\u0161kos kalbos gramatika'', was the first to formulate and expound the essential principles that were so indispensable to its later development. His proposal for Standard Lithuanian was based on his native [[Suvalkija|Western Auk\u0161taitija]]n dialect with some features of the eastern [[Prussian Lithuanians]]' dialect spoken in [[Lithuania Minor]]. These dialects{{clarify|date=November 2014}}<!--Which dialects? Both the western and the eastern?--> had preserved archaic phonetics mostly intact due to the influence of the neighbouring [[Old Prussian language]], while the other dialects had experienced different [[Vowel shift|phonetic shift]]s.

During the Soviet era (see [[History of Lithuania]]), it was used in official discourse along with [[Russian language|Russian]], which, as the official language of the [[Soviet Union|USSR]], took precedence over Lithuanian.<ref>{{cite book|last=Dini|first=P.U.|title=Balt\u0173 kalbos.

Some theories, such as that of [[J\u0101nis Endzel\u012bns]], considered that the Baltic languages form their own distinct branch of the family of [[Indo-European languages]]. There is also an opinion that suggests the union of Baltic and Slavic languages into a distinct sub-family of [[Balto-Slavic languages]] amongst the Indo-European family of languages. Such an opinion was first represented by the likes of [[August Schleicher]]{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}, and to a certain extent, [[Antoine Meillet]]{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}. Endzel\u012bns thought that the similarity between Baltic and Slavic was explicable through language contact while Schleicher, Meillet and others argued for a genetic kinship between the two families.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nAn attempt to reconcile the opposing stances was made by [[Jan Micha\u0142 Rozwadowski]]. He proposed that the two language groups were indeed a unity after the division of Indo-European, but also suggested that after the two had divided into separate entities (Baltic and Slavic), they had posterior contact. The genetic kinship view is augmented by the fact that Proto-Balto-Slavic is easily reconstructible with important proofs in historic prosody. The alleged (or certain, as certain as historic linguistics can be) similarities due to contact are seen in such phenomena as the existence of definite adjectives formed by the addition of an inflected pronoun (descended from the same Proto-Indo-European pronoun), which exist in both Baltic and Slavic yet nowhere else in the Indo-European family (languages such as Albanian and the [[Germanic languages]] developed definite adjectives independently), and that are not reconstructible for Proto-Balto-Slavic, meaning that they most probably developed through language contact. {{citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\nThe Baltic [[hydronym]]s area stretches from the [[Vistula]] River in the west to the east of [[Moscow]] and from the [[Baltic Sea]] in the north to the south of [[Kiev]].<ref>{{cite book|last= Mallory; Adams|first = J.

It is also spoken by ethnic Lithuanians living in today's [[Belarus]], [[Latvia]], [[Poland]], and the [[Kaliningrad Oblast]] of Russia, as well as by sizable emigrant communities in [[Argentina]], [[Australia]], [[Brazil]], [[Canada]], [[Denmark]], [[Estonia]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Iceland]], [[Ireland]], [[Norway]], [[Russia]], [[Sweden]], the [[United Kingdom]], the [[United States]], [[Uruguay]], and [[Spain]].\n\n2,955,200 people in Lithuania (including 3,460 [[Lipka Tatars|Tatars]]), or about 86% of the 2015 population, are native Lithuanian speakers; most Lithuanian inhabitants of other nationalities also speak Lithuanian to some extent. The total worldwide Lithuanian-speaking population is about 3,200,000.\n\n===Official status===\nLithuanian is the [[state language]] of Lithuania and an official language of the [[European Union]].\n\n===Dialects===\n[[File:Map of dialects of Lithuanian language.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|Dialects of Lithuanian.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Zinkevi\u010dius | first = Zigmas |author2=Alexas Stanislovas Girdenis | title = D\u0117l lietuvi\u0173 kalbos tarmi\u0173 klasifikacijos | journal = Kalbotyra (Slavistica Vilnensis) | volume = 14 | year = 1966 | issn = 1392-1517 }}</ref> [[Samogitian dialect|Samogitian subdialects]] are yellow, red, and brown; [[Auk\u0161taitian dialect|Auk\u0161taitian subdialects]] are green, blue, and purple.]]\nThe Lithuanian language has two dialects: [[Auk\u0161taitija|Auk\u0161tai\u010di\u0173]] ([[Auk\u0161taitian dialect|Auk\u0161taitian]], Highland Lithuanian) and [[Samogitia|\u017demai\u010di\u0173/\u017demaitiu]] ([[Samogitian dialect|Samogitian]], Lowland Lithuanian). There are significant differences between standard Lithuanian and Samogitian and these were often described as separate languages. The modern Samogitian dialect formed in the 13th\u201316th centuries under the influence of the [[Curonian language]]. Lithuanian dialects are closely connected with [[regions of Lithuania|ethnographical regions of Lithuania]].\n\nDialects are divided into subdialects. Both dialects have three subdialects. Samogitian is divided into West, North and South; Auk\u0161taitian into West (Suvalkie\u010diai), [[Dz\u016bkian|South (Dz\u016bkai)]] and East.\n\nStandard Lithuanian is derived mostly from Western Auk\u0161taitian dialects, including the Eastern dialect of [[Lithuania Minor]]. Influence of other dialects is more significant in the vocabulary of standard Lithuanian.\n\n==Script==\n{{IPA notice}}\n{{main|Lithuanian orthography}}\n{{see also|Lithuanian Braille}}\nLithuanian uses the [[Latin script]] supplemented with [[diacritic]]s. It has 32 [[Letter (alphabet)|letters]]. In the [[collation]] order, ''y'' follows immediately after ''\u012f'' (called ''i [[ogonek|nosin\u0117]]''), because both ''y'' and ''\u012f'' represent the same long vowel {{IPAblink|i\u02d0}}:\n\n{|class=wikitable style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"32\"|[[Capital letters|Majuscule forms]] (also called '''uppercase''' or '''capital letters''')\n|-\n| A || \u0104 || B || C || \u010c || D || E || \u0118\n| \u0116 || F || G || H || I || \u012e || Y || J\n| K || L || M || N || O || P || R || S\n| \u0160 || T || U || \u0172 || \u016a || V || Z || \u017d\n|-\n! colspan=\"32\"|[[Lower case|Minuscule forms]] (also called '''lowercase''' or '''small letters''')\n|-\n| a || \u0105 || b || c || \u010d || d || e || \u0119\n| \u0117 || f || g || h || i || \u012f || y || j\n| k || l || m || n || o || p || r || s\n| \u0161 || t || u || \u0173 || \u016b || v || z || \u017e\n|}\n\nIn addition, the following digraphs are used, but are treated as sequences of two letters for collation purposes. The digraph ''ch'' represents a single sound, the velar fricative {{IPAblink|x}}, while ''dz'' and ''d\u017e'' are pronounced like straightforward combinations of their component letters (sounds):\n\nDz dz {{IPAblink|dz}} (dz\u0117), D\u017e d\u017e {{IPAblink|d\u0292}} (d\u017e\u0117), Ch ch {{IPAblink|x}} (cha).\n\nThe Lithuanian writing system is largely phonemic, i.e., one letter usually corresponds to a single [[phoneme]] (sound). There are a few exceptions: for example, the letter ''i'' represents either the vowel {{IPAblink|\u026a}}, as in the English ''sit'', or is silent and merely indicates that the preceding consonant is [[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatalized]]. The latter is largely the case when ''i'' occurs after a consonant and is followed by a [[Back vowel|back]] or a [[central vowel]], except in some borrowed words (e.g., the first consonant in ''l\u016bpa'' {{IPA|[\u02c8'''\u026b'''\u00fb\u02d0p\u0250]}}, \"lip\", is a [[Velarized alveolar lateral approximant|velarized dental lateral approximant]]; on the other hand, the first consonant in ''li\u016btas'' {{IPA|[\u02c8'''l\u02b2'''u\u02d0t\u032a\u0250s\u032a]}}, \"lion\", is a palatalized [[alveolar lateral approximant]]; both consonants are followed by the same vowel, the long {{IPAblink|u\u02d0}}, and no {{IPAblink|\u026a}} can be pronounced in ''li\u016btas''). Before the 20th century, due to the [[Lithuanian press ban]], Lithuanian alphabet included the Polish \u0141 for the first sound and regular L (without a following i) for the second: ''\u0142upa'', ''lutas''.\n\nA [[Macron (diacritic)|macron]] (on ''u''), an [[ogonek]] (on ''a'', ''e'', ''i'', and ''u''), and ''y'' (in place of ''i'') are used for grammatical and historical reasons and always denote [[vowel length]] in Modern Standard Lithuanian. [[Acute accent|Acute]], [[Grave accent|grave]], and [[tilde]] diacritics are used to indicate [[pitch accent]]s. However, these pitch accents are generally not written, except in dictionaries, grammars, and where needed for clarity, such as to differentiate homonyms and dialectal use.\n\n==Phonology==\n{{main|Lithuanian phonology}}\n\n===Consonants===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+ Consonant phonemes of Lithuanian\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"2\"|&nbsp;\n! colspan=\"2\"|[[Labial consonant|Labial]]\n! colspan=\"2\"|[[Dental consonant|Dental]]\n! colspan=\"2\"|[[Alveolar consonant|Alveolar]]\n! rowspan=\"2\"|[[Palatal consonant|Palatal]]\n! colspan=\"2\"|[[Velar consonant|Velar]]\n|- style=\"font-size:small;\"\n! hard\n! soft\n! hard\n! soft\n! hard\n! soft\n! hard\n! soft\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\"|[[Nasal consonant|Nasal]]\n| {{IPA link|m}} || {{IPA|m\u02b2}}\n| {{IPA link|n\u032a|n}} || {{IPA|n\u02b2}}\n| \n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\"|[[Stop consonant|Stop]]\n! {{small|voiceless}}\n| {{IPA link|p}} || {{IPA|p\u02b2}}\n| {{IPA link|t\u032a|t}} || {{IPA|t\u02b2}}\n|\n|\n|\n| {{IPA|k}} || {{IPA link|k\u02b2}}\n|-\n! {{small|voiced}}\n| {{IPA link|b}} || {{IPA|b\u02b2}}\n| {{IPA link|d\u032a|d}} || {{IPA|d\u02b2}}\n|\n|\n|\n| {{IPA|\u0261}} || {{IPA link|\u0261\u02b2}}\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\"|[[Affricate consonant|Affricate]]\n! {{small|voiceless}}\n| colspan=\"2\"|&nbsp;\n| {{IPA link|t\u032a\u0361s\u032a|t\u0361s}} || {{IPA|t\u0361s\u02b2}}\n| {{IPA link|t\u0361\u0283}} || {{IPA link|t\u0361\u0255}}\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! {{small|voiced}}\n| colspan=\"2\"|&nbsp;\n| {{IPA link|d\u032a\u0361z\u032a|d\u0361z}} || {{IPA|d\u0361z\u02b2}}\n| {{IPA link|d\u0361\u0292}} || {{IPA link|d\u0361\u0291}}\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\"|[[Fricative consonant|Fricative]]\n! {{small|voiceless}}\n| ({{IPA link|f}}) || ({{IPA|f\u02b2}})\n| {{IPA link|s\u032a|s}} || {{IPA|s\u02b2}}\n| {{IPA link|\u0283}} || {{IPA link|\u0255}}\n|\n| ({{IPA|x}}) || ({{IPA link|x\u02b2}})\n|-\n! {{small|voiced}}\n| rowspan=\"2\"|{{IPA|v}} || rowspan=\"2\"|{{IPA|v\u02b2}}\n| {{IPA link|z\u032a|z}} || {{IPA|z\u02b2}}\n| {{IPA link|\u0292}} || {{IPA link|\u0291}}\n| rowspan=\"2\"|{{IPA|j}}\n| ({{IPA|\u0263}}) || ({{IPA link|\u0263\u02b2}})\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\"|[[Approximant consonant|Approximant]]\n| {{IPA link|\u026b\u032a|\u026b}}\n|\n| \n| {{IPA link|l|l\u02b2}}\n| ||\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\"|[[Trill consonant|Trill]]\n| colspan=\"2\"|&nbsp;\n| colspan=\"2\"|&nbsp;\n| {{IPA link|r}} || {{IPA|r\u02b2}}\n|\n|\n|\n|}\n\nAll Lithuanian consonants except {{IPA|/j/}} have two variants: the non-[[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatalized]] one represented by the [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] symbols in the chart, and the [[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatalized]] one (i.e. {{IPA|/b/}}&nbsp;\u2013 {{IPA|/b\u02b2/}}, {{IPA|/d/}}&nbsp;\u2013 {{IPA|/d\u02b2/}}, {{IPA|/\u0261/}}&nbsp;\u2013 {{IPA|/\u0261\u02b2/}}, and so on).

Its accentuation is sometimes described as a simple [[tone (linguistics)|tone]] system, often called [[pitch accent]].<ref name=tone>''Phonetic invariance and phonological stability: Lithuanian pitch accents'' Grzegorz Dogil & Gregor M\u00f6hler, 1998 [http://eprints.kfupm.edu.sa/57901/]{{dead link|date=February 2014}}</ref> In [[lexical word]]s, one syllable will be tonically prominent. A [[heavy syllable]]\u2014that is, a syllable containing a [[long vowel]], [[diphthong]], or a [[sonorant]] coda\u2014may have one of two tones, ''falling tone'' (or ''acute tone'') or ''rising tone'' (or ''circumflex tone''). Light syllables (syllables with short vowels and optionally also [[obstruent]] codas) do not have the two-way contrast of heavy syllables.\n\n==Grammar==\n{{Main|Lithuanian grammar}}\nLithuanian is a highly [[inflected language]]. In Lithuanian, there are two [[grammatical gender]]s for nouns&nbsp;\u2013 masculine and feminine, and there are three genders for adjectives, pronouns, numerals and participles: masculine, feminine and neuter. Every attribute has to follow the gender and the number of the noun. The neuter forms of other parts of speech are used with a [[Subject (grammar)|subject]] of an undefined gender (a pronoun, an infinitive etc.).\n\nThere are twelve [[noun]] and five [[adjective]] [[declension]]s and one (masculine and feminine) participle declension.<ref>Dabartin\u0117s lietuvi\u0173 kalbos gramatika. Vilnius, 1997</ref>\n\nNouns and other parts of nominal morphology are declined in seven cases: [[nominative]], [[genitive]], [[dative]], [[Accusative case|accusative]], [[instrumental case|instrumental]], [[Locative case|locative]], and [[Vocative case|vocative]]. In older Lithuanian texts three additional varieties of the locative case are found: [[Illative case|illative]], [[Adessive case|adessive]] and [[Allative case|allative]]. The most common are the [[Illative case|illative]], which still is used, mostly in spoken language, and the [[Allative case|allative]], which survives in the standard language in some idiomatic usages. The adessive is nearly extinct. These additional cases are probably due to the influence of Uralic languages with which Baltic languages have had a long-standing contact (Uralic languages have a great variety of noun cases, a number of which are specialised locative cases).\n\nThe Lithuanian verbal morphology shows a number of innovations. Namely, the loss of synthetic passive (which is hypothesized based on the more archaic though long-extinct Indo-European languages), synthetic perfect (formed via the means of reduplication) and aorist; forming subjunctive and imperative with the use of suffixes plus flexions as opposed to solely flections in, e. g., Ancient Greek; loss of the optative mood; merging and disappearing of the -t- and -nt- markers for third person singular and plural, respectively (this, however, occurs in Latvian and Old Prussian as well and may indicate a collective feature of all Baltic languages).\n\nOn the other hand, the Lithuanian verbal morphology retains a number of archaic features absent from most modern Indo-European languages (but shared with Latvian). This includes the synthetic formation of the future tense with the help of the -s- suffix; three principal verbal forms with the present tense stem employing the -n- and -st- infixes.\n\nThere are three [[verb]]al [[grammatical conjugation|conjugation]]s. The verb ''b\u016bti'' is the only auxiliary verb in the language. Together with participles, it is used to form dozens of compound forms.\n\nIn the '''active voice''', each verb can be inflected for any of the following [[Grammatical mood|moods]]:\n\n#Indicative\n#Indirect\n#Imperative\n#Conditional/subjunctive\n\nIn the [[indicative mood]] and indirect moods, all verbs can have eleven [[Grammatical tense|tenses]]:\n#simple: [[present tense|present]] (''ne\u0161u''), [[past tense|past]] (''ne\u0161iau''), [[past iterative tense|past iterative]] (''ne\u0161davau'') and [[future tense|future]] (''ne\u0161iu'')\n#compound:\n##present perfect (''esu ne\u0161\u0119s''), past perfect (''buvau ne\u0161\u0119s''), past iterative perfect (''b\u016bdavau ne\u0161\u0119s''), future perfect (''b\u016bsiu ne\u0161\u0119s'')\n##past inchoative (''buvau bene\u0161\u0105s''), past iterative inchoative (''b\u016bdavau bene\u0161\u0105s''), future inchoative (''b\u016bsiu bene\u0161\u0105s'')\n\nThe indirect mood, used only in written narrative speech, has the same tenses corresponding to the appropriate active participle in nominative case, e. g. past of the indirect mood would be ''ne\u0161\u0119s'', past iterative inchoative of the indirect mood would be ''b\u016bdav\u0119s bene\u0161\u0105s''. Since it is a nominal form, this mood cannot be conjugated, but must match the subject's number and gender.\n\nThe [[subjunctive mood|subjunctive]] (or [[conditional mood|conditional]]) <!-- see notes in the discussion page of the Lithuanian grammar--> and the [[imperative mood|imperative]] [[grammatical mood|mood]]s have three tenses. Subjunctive: present (''ne\u0161\u010diau''), past (''b\u016b\u010diau ne\u0161\u0119s''), inchoative (''b\u016b\u010diau bene\u0161\u0105s''); imperative: present (''ne\u0161k''), perfect (''b\u016bk ne\u0161\u0119s'') and inchoative (''b\u016bk bene\u0161\u0105s'').\n\nThe [[infinitive]] has only one form (''ne\u0161ti''). These forms, except the infinitive and indirect mood, are conjugative, having two singular, two plural persons and the third person form common both for plural and singular.\n\nIn the '''passive voice''', the form number is not as rich as in the active voice. There are two types of passive voice in Lithuanian: present participle (type I) ant past participle (type II) (in the examples below types I and II are separated with a slash). They both have the same moods and tenses:\n\n#Indicative mood: [[present tense|present]] (''esu ne\u0161amas/ne\u0161tas''), [[past tense|past]] (''buvau ne\u0161amas/ne\u0161tas''), [[past iterative tense|past iterative]] (''b\u016bdavau ne\u0161amas/ne\u0161tas'') and [[future tense|future]] (''b\u016bsiu ne\u0161amas/ne\u0161tas'')\n#Indirect mood: [[present tense|present]] (''es\u0105s ne\u0161amas/ne\u0161tas''), [[past tense|past]] (''buv\u0119s ne\u0161amas/ne\u0161tas''), [[past iterative tense|past iterative]] (''b\u016bdav\u0119s ne\u0161amas/ne\u0161tas'') and [[future tense|future]] (''b\u016bsi\u0105s ne\u0161amas/ne\u0161tas'').\n#Imperative mood: present (type I only: ''b\u016bk ne\u0161amas''), past (type II only: ''b\u016bk ne\u0161tas'').\n#Subjunctive / conditional mood: present (type I only: ''b\u016b\u010diau ne\u0161amas''), past (type II only: ''b\u016b\u010diau ne\u0161tas'').\n\nLithuanian has the richest [[participle]] system of all Indo-European languages, having participles derived from all simple tenses with distinct active and passive forms, and two gerund forms.\n\nIn practical terms, the rich overall inflectional system makes the word order have a different meaning than in more [[analytic language]]s such as English. The English phrase \"'''a''' car is coming\" translates as \"atva\u017eiuoja automobilis\" (the [[Topic and comment|theme]] first), while \"'''the''' car is coming\" \u2013 \"automobilis atva\u017eiuoja\" (the theme first; word order inversion).\n\nLithuanian also has a very rich word derivation system and an array of diminutive suffixes.\n\nThe first prescriptive grammar book of Lithuanian was commissioned by the Duke of Prussia, Frederick William, for use in the Lithuanian-speaking parishes of East-Prussia. It was written in [[Latin]] and German by [[Daniel Klein (grammarian)|Daniel Klein]] and published in [[K\u00f6nigsberg]] in 1653/1654. The first scientific ''Compendium of Lithuanian language'' was published in German in 1856/57 by [[August Schleicher]], a professor at [[Prague]] University. In it he describes Prussian-Lithuanian which later is to become the \"skeleton\" (B\u016bga) of modern Lithuanian.\n\nToday there are two definitive books on Lithuanian grammar: one in English, the \"Introduction to Modern Lithuanian\" (called \"Beginner's Lithuanian\" in its newer editions) by [[Leonardas Dambri\u016bnas]], [[Antanas Klimas]] and [[William R. Schmalstieg]], and another in Russian, [[Vytautas Ambrazas]]' \"\u0413\u0440\u0430\u043c\u043c\u0430\u0442\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u043b\u0438\u0442\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u044f\u0437\u044b\u043a\u0430\" (\"The Grammar of the Lithuanian Language\"). Another recent book on Lithuanian grammar is the second edition of \"Review of Modern Lithuanian Grammar\" by Edmund Remys, published by Lithuanian Research and Studies Center, Chicago, 2003.\n\n==Vocabulary==\n[[File:Lkz.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|[[Academic Dictionary of Lithuanian|The Grand Dictionary of the Lithuanian language]] consists of 20 volumes and contains more than half a million [[headword]]s]]\n\n===Indo-European vocabulary===\nLithuanian retains [[cognate]]s to many words found in classical languages, such as [[Sanskrit]] and [[Latin language|Latin]]. These words are descended from [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]]. A few examples are the following:\n\n* Lith. and Skt. ''s\u016bnus'' (son)\n* Lith. and Skt. ''avis'' and Lat. ''ovis'' (sheep)\n* Lith. ''d\u016bmas'' and Skt. ''d<sup>h</sup>\u016bmas'' and Lat. ''fumus'' (fumes, smoke)\n* Lith. ''antras'' and Skt. ''antaras'' (second, the other)\n* Lith. ''vilkas'' and Skt. ''v\u1e5bkas'' (wolf)\n* Lith. ''ratas'' and Lat. ''rota'' (wheel) and Skt. ''rat<sup>h</sup>as'' (carriage).\n* Lith. ''senis'' and Lat. ''senex'' (an old man) and Skt. ''sanas'' (old).\n* Lith. ''vyras'' and Lat. ''vir'' (a man) and Skt. ''v\u012bras'' (man).\n* Lith. ''angis'' and Lat. ''anguis'' (a snake in Latin, a species of snakes in Lithuanian)\n* Lith. ''linas'' and Lat. ''linum'' (flax, compare with English 'linen')\n* Lith. ''ariu'' and Lat. ''aro'' (I plow)\n* Lith. ''jungiu'' and Lat. ''iungo'', and Skt. ''yu\u00f1je'' (mid.), (I join)\n* Lith. ''gentys'' and Lat. ''gentes'' and Skt. ''j\u00e1ntis'' (tribes)\n* Lith. ''m\u0117nesis'' and Lat. ''mensis'' and Skt ''masas'' (month)\n* Lith. ''dantis'' and Lat. ''dentes'' and Skt ''dantas'' (teeth)\n* Lith. ''naktis'' and Lat. ''noctes'' and Skt. ''naktis'' (night)\n* Lith. ''ugnis'' and Lat. ''ignis'' and Skt. ''agnis'' (fire)\n* Lith. ''s\u0117dime'' and Lat. ''sedemus'' and Skt. ''s\u012bdamas\u2019\u2019 (we sit)\n\nThis even extends to grammar, where for example Latin noun declensions ending in ''-um'' often correspond to Lithuanian ''-\u0173'', with the [[Latin declension#Fourth declension (u)|Latin]] and [[Lithuanian declension#Table of noun declension endings|Lithuanian fourth declensions]] being particularly close. Many of the words from this list share similarities with other Indo-European languages, including English and Russian. The contribution of Lithuanian was influential in the reconstruction of the [[Proto-Indo-European language]].\n\nLexical and grammatical similarities between Baltic and [[Slavic languages]] suggest an affinity between these two language groups. On the other hand, there exist a number of Baltic (particularly Lithuanian) words without counterparts in Slavic languages, but which are similar to words in Sanskrit or Latin.<!-- Not from the list above. Cf. Russian \u0441\u044b\u043d, \u043e\u0432\u0446\u0430, \u0434\u044b\u043c, \u0432\u043e\u043b\u043a, etc. --> The history of the relationship between Baltic and Slavic languages, and our{{Who|date=June 2019}} understanding of the affinity between the two groups, remain in dispute (see: [[Balto-Slavic languages]]).\n\n===Loanwords===\nIn a 1934 book entitled ''Die Germanismen des Litauischen. Teil I: Die deutschen Lehnw\u00f6rter im Litauischen'', K. Alminauskis found 2,770 loanwords, of which about 130 were of uncertain origin. The majority of the loanwords were found to have been derived from the [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]], and [[German language|German]] languages, with some evidence that these languages all acquired the words from contacts and trade with [[Prussia]] during the era of the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]].<ref>[http://cejsh.icm.edu.pl/cejsh/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?07PLAAAA02144515 Ways of Germanisms into Lithuanian].

Some of these include:\n* Taksi ([[taxicab|taxi]])\n* Pica ([[pizza]])\n* Alkoholis ([[alcohol]])\n* Bankas ([[bank]])\n* Pasas ([[passport]], pass)\n\nThese words have been modified to suit the grammatical and phonetic requirements of the Lithuanian language, but their foreign roots are obvious.\n\n==Old Lithuanian==\nThe language of the earliest Lithuanian writings, in the 16th and 17th centuries, is known as '''Old Lithuanian''' and differs in some significant respects from the Lithuanian of today.\n\nBesides the specific differences given below, nouns, verbs, and adjectives still had separate endings for the [[dual (grammatical number)|dual number]]. The dual persists today in some dialects. Example:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Case !! \"two good friends\"\n|-\n| Nom-Acc || d\u00f9 ger\u00f9 draug\u00f9\n|-\n| Dat || dv\u0131\u0307\u0301em ger\u0131\u0307\u0301em draug\u00e1m\n|-\n| Inst || dviem\u0303 geriem\u0303 draugam\u0303\n|}\n\n===Pronunciation===\nThe vowels written ''\u0105, \u0119, \u012f, \u0173'' were still pronounced as long [[nasal vowel]]s,{{sfnp|Ambrazas et al.|1997|p=13}} not as long oral vowels as in today's Lithuanian.\n\nThe original Baltic long ''\u0101'' was still retained as such, e.g. ''bralis'' \"brother\" (modern ''br\u00f3lis'').\n\n===Nouns===\nCompared to the modern language, there were three additional cases, formed under the influence of the [[Finnic languages]]. The original [[locative case]] had been replaced by four so-called ''postpositive'' cases, the [[inessive case]], [[illative case]], [[adessive case]] and [[allative case]], which correspond to the prepositions \"in\", \"into\", \"at\" and \"towards\", respectively. They were formed by affixing a [[postposition]] to one of the previous cases:\n*The inessive added ''-en'' to the original locative.\n*The illative added ''-n(a)'' to the accusative.\n*The adessive added ''-pie'' to the original locative.\n*The allative added ''-pie'' to the genitive.\nThe inessive has become the modern locative case, while the other three have disappeared. Note, however, that the illative case is still used occasionally in the colloquial language (mostly in the singular): ''Lietuvon'' \"to Lithuania\", ''miestan'' \"to the city\". This form is relatively productive: for instance, it is not uncommon to hear \"skrendame Niujork'''an''' (we are flying to New York)\".\n\nThe uncontracted dative plural ''-mus'' was still common.\n\n===Adjectives===\nAdjectives could belong to all four accent classes in Old Lithuanian (now they can only belong to classes 3 and 4).\n\nAdditional remnants of i-stem adjectives still existed, e.g.:\n*loc. sg. ''didim\u00e8 pulk\u00e8'' \"in the big crowd\" (now ''did\u017eiame'')\n*loc. sg. ''ger\u00e8snime'' \"better\" (now ''geresniam\u00e8'')\n*loc. sg. ''ma\u017ei\u00e1usime'' \"smallest\" (now ''ma\u017ei\u00e1usiame'')\n\nAdditional remnants of u-stem adjectives still existed, e.g. ''r\u016bg\u0161t\u00f9s'' \"sour\":\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Case !! Newer !! Older\n|-\n| Inst sg || r\u016bg\u0161\u010di\u00f9 || r\u016bg\u0161tum\u0131\u0307\u0300\n|-\n| Loc sg || r\u016bg\u0161\u010diam\u00e8 || r\u016bg\u0161tum\u00e8\n|-\n| Gen pl || r\u016bg\u0161\u010di\u0173\u0303 || r\u016bg\u0161t\u0173\u0303\n|-\n| Acc pl || r\u016b\u0301g\u0161\u010dius || r\u016b\u0301g\u0161tus\n|-\n| Inst pl || r\u016bg\u0161\u010dia\u0131\u0307\u0303s || r\u016bg\u0161tum\u0131\u0307\u0300s\n|}\n\nNo u-stem remnants existed in the dative singular and locative plural.\n\nDefinite adjectives, originally involving a pronoun suffixed to an adjective, had not merged into a single word in Old Lithuanian. Examples:\n*''pa-jo-prasto'' \"ordinary\" (now ''p\u00e0prastojo'')\n*''nu-jie-varg\u0119'' \"tired\" (now ''nuvar\u0303gusieji'')\n\n===Verbs===\nThe [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] class of [[athematic verb]]s still existed in Old Lithuanian:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! &nbsp; !! 'be' !! 'remain' !! 'give' !! 'save'\n|-\n| 1st sg || esm\u0131\u0307\u0300 || liekm\u0131\u0307\u0300 || d\u00faomi || g\u00e9lbmi\n|-\n| 2nd sg || es\u0131\u0307\u0300 || lieks\u0131\u0307\u0300 || d\u00faosi || g\u00e9lbsi\n|-\n| 3rd sg || \u1ebdst(i) || li\u1ebdkt(i) || d\u00faost(i) || g\u00e9lbt(i)\n|-\n| 1st dual || esv\u00e0 || liekv\u00e0 || d\u00faova || g\u00e9lbva\n|-\n| 2nd dual || est\u00e0 || liekt\u00e0 || d\u00faosta || g\u00e9lbta\n|-\n| 1st pl || esm\u00e8 || liekm\u00e8 || d\u00faome || g\u00e9lbme\n|-\n| 2nd pl || est\u00e8 || liekt\u00e8 || d\u00faoste || g\u00e9lbte\n|-\n| 3rd pl || \u1ebdsti || li\u1ebdkt(i) || d\u00faost(i) || g\u00e9lbt(i)\n|}\n\nThe [[optative mood]] (i.e. the third-person imperative) still had its own endings, ''-ai'' for third-conjugation verbs and ''-ie'' for other verbs, instead of using regular third-person present endings.\n\n===Syntax===\nWord order was freer in Old Lithuanian. For example, a noun in the [[genitive case]] could either precede or follow the noun it modifies.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Lithuanian dictionaries]]\n* [[Martynas Ma\u017evydas]]\n* [[Samogitian dialect]]\n* [[Lithuanian literature]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n* {{Citation\n|last1=Ambrazas\n|first1=Vytautas\n|last2=Geniu\u0161ien\u0117\n|first2=Emma\n|last3=Girdenis\n|first3=Aleksas\n|last4=Sli\u017eien\u0117\n|first4=Nijol\u0117\n|last5=Valeckien\u0117\n|first5=Adel\u0117\n|last6=Valiulyt\u0117\n|first6=Elena\n|last7=Tekorien\u0117\n|first7=Dalija\n|last8=Pa\u017e\u016bsis\n|first8=Lionginas\n|year=1997\n|editor-last=Ambrazas\n|editor-first=Vytautas\n|title=Lithuanian Grammar\n|publisher=Institute of the Lithuanian Language\n|place=Vilnius\n|isbn=9986-813-22-0\n|ref={{harvid|Ambrazas et al.|1997}}\n}}\n* {{SOWL}}\n* Leonardas Dambri\u016bnas, Antanas Klimas, William R.

He was [[Mayor of Wellington]] for two terms from 1944 to 1950 after serving as a city councillor from 1931 to 1944. He was [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]] in [[1950 Birthday Honours|1950]].\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life and career===\nAppleton was born in [[Alexandra, New Zealand|Alexandra]] in [[Central Otago]] in 1889, the eldest of nine children. His parents were Yorkshireman Edwin Appleton and his Scottish wife, Margaret Bruce. The Appleton family briefly moved to [[Gisborne, New Zealand|Gisborne]] in 1904 but was back in Alexandra in the following year. Appleton, left by the postmaster in charge of the local post office as a teenager, did some bookkeeping for local businesses. In October 1906, aged 17, he was appointed a cadet in the accountancy department of the General Post Office at [[Wellington]]. In 1909 he passed his accountancy exams.<ref name=\"DNZB Appleton\" />\n\nHe left the Post and Telegraph Department, then still a centre of modern communications technology, and in April 1910 joined advertising agent Charles Haines and Co. Haines had founded his business, the country's first [[advertising agency]], in Wellington in 1891.<ref>[https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/EP19100423.2.24 ''The Evening Post''] page 5, 23 April 1910</ref><ref>[https://teara.govt.nz/en/advertising/page-2 ''Te Ara''] Advertising agencies, 1891\u20131970</ref> Will married Mary Helen (Nell) Munro in March 1913.

Nell died in 1918's influenza epidemic. The following year he married Rose Hellewell and they had a daughter and two sons.<ref name=\"DNZB Appleton\" />\n\nMeanwhile, Appleton maintained his local body interests serving on the Wellington Hospital Board from 1923. In 1931 he successfully stood for the Wellington City Council.<ref name=\"DNZB Appleton\" /> Then in 1932 he sold his interest in Charles Haines to his former partners, accepted directorships in many major listed companies and devoted himself to politics.<ref>[https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/EP19320630.2.107 ''The Evening Post] page 12, 30 June 1932</ref>\n\n===Political career===\n====Local politics====\n[[File:Cecil Wood, Rt Rev H St Barbe Holland and Will Appleton.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Cathedral architect, Bishop and (Presbyterian) mayor.

He was [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]] in [[1950 Birthday Honours|1950]].\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life and career===\nAppleton was born in [[Alexandra, New Zealand|Alexandra]] in [[Central Otago]] in 1889, the eldest of nine children. His parents were Yorkshireman Edwin Appleton and his Scottish wife, Margaret Bruce. The Appleton family briefly moved to [[Gisborne, New Zealand|Gisborne]] in 1904 but was back in Alexandra in the following year. Appleton, left by the postmaster in charge of the local post office as a teenager, did some bookkeeping for local businesses. In October 1906, aged 17, he was appointed a cadet in the accountancy department of the General Post Office at [[Wellington]]. In 1909 he passed his accountancy exams.<ref name=\"DNZB Appleton\" />\n\nHe left the Post and Telegraph Department, then still a centre of modern communications technology, and in April 1910 joined advertising agent Charles Haines and Co. Haines had founded his business, the country's first [[advertising agency]], in Wellington in 1891.<ref>[https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/EP19100423.2.24 ''The Evening Post''] page 5, 23 April 1910</ref><ref>[https://teara.govt.nz/en/advertising/page-2 ''Te Ara''] Advertising agencies, 1891\u20131970</ref> Will married Mary Helen (Nell) Munro in March 1913.

Although the constituency is relatively large by geographical area, it is a predominantly urban rather than rural seat, with the majority  of the population living in the two towns on which the constituency is based, [[Bangor, Wales|Bangor]] and [[Caernarfon]].  \"Arfon\" is a historical name for the area, meaning \"facing Anglesey\"; it is also the name of the [[District of Arfon|former district council]]. This seat was created by the Welsh Boundary Commission in time for the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010 general election]], and replaced the old seat of [[Caernarfon (UK Parliament constituency)|Caernarfon]]. Bangor was in the old seat of [[Conwy (UK Parliament constituency)|Conwy]]. The same boundaries were used for the [[Arfon (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Arfon Welsh Assembly constituency]] in the [[2007 National Assembly for Wales election|2007 Welsh Assembly election]].\n\nIt is the smallest constituency on the mainland of Great Britain by electorate, and larger only than the two [[Scotland|Scottish]] island constituencies, [[Na h-Eileanan an Iar (UK Parliament constituency)|Na h-Eileanan an Iar]] and [[Orkney and Shetland (UK Parliament constituency)|Orkney and Shetland]]. The total population as of the 2011 census was 60,573.\n\nThe Arfon division of [[Caernarvonshire]] was a former UK Parliament constituency, which existed from 1885 until 1918. Before 1885 and after 1918 the area was part of the [[Caernarvonshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Caernarvonshire]] constituency. The Liberal MP William Rathbone represented the Arfon seat until 1895, followed by fellow Liberal William Jones. Upon the death of Mr Jones, Griffith C. Rees, for the Liberal Party, was elected unopposed at the subsequent by-election.<ref>Information in the paragraph is taken in part from F.W.S Craig's ''British Parliamentary Election Results 1885-1918'' (Macmillan, 1974).</ref>\n\n== Boundaries ==\nWhen first created in 1885, the constituency was defined as the Petty Sessional Divisions of Bangor, Conway and Nant-Conway, with the Parishes of Llanddeinilen and Llanberis (which were within the Carnarvon Petty Sessional Division). The constituency included the boroughs of Bangor and Conway which were part of the [[Caernarfon (UK Parliament constituency)|Carnarvon District of Boroughs]] constituency; only those who owned freehold land within the boroughs could vote in elections for the Arfon constituency as a second vote.\n\nThe new constituency was a merger of northern [[Caernarfon (UK Parliament constituency)|Caernarfon]] and western [[Conwy (UK Parliament constituency)|Conwy]].\nThe electoral wards used to create the current constituency are entirely within the preserved county of [[Gwynedd]]; They are Arllechwedd, Bethel, Bontnewydd, Cadnant, Cwm-y-Glo, Deiniol, Deiniolen, Dewi, Garth, Gerlan, Glyder, Groeslon, Hendre, Hirael, [[Llanberis]], Llanllyfni, Llanrug, Llanwnda, Marchog, [[Menai (ward)|Menai]] ([[Bangor, Wales|Bangor]]), [[Menai (Caernarfon ward)|Menai]] ([[Caernarfon]]), Ogwen, [[Peblig, Caernarfon|Peblig]], Penisarwaun, Pentir, Penygroes, [[Seiont (electoral ward)|Seiont]], Talysarn, Tregarth and Mynydd Llandygai, Waunfawr and Y Felinheli.\n\n== Electoral history (current constituency) ==\n\nThe latest boundary change created a battleground in Arfon particularly for Labour, Plaid Cymru, and the Conservatives, with the latter being labelled as a 'resurgent' party by the Caernarfon Herald.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.caernarfonherald.co.uk/caernarfon-county-news/local-caernarfon-news/2010/04/01/big-three-battle-to-win-arfon-seat-at-the-general-election-88817-26150947/ |title=Caernarfon Herald |publisher=Caernarfon Herald |accessdate=11 April 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100413185448/http://www.caernarfonherald.co.uk/caernarfon-county-news/local-caernarfon-news/2010/04/01/big-three-battle-to-win-arfon-seat-at-the-general-election-88817-26150947/| archivedate= 13 April 2010 | url-status= live}}</ref> The scale of contention had been reached due to the large shift in boundary changes which in turn has created a need within each party to achieve a relatively unforeseen outcome. Plaid Cymru had previously never represented Bangor, which had been held by Conservative [[Wyn Roberts]] for twenty-seven years and a further thirteen under Labour's [[Betty Williams (politician)|Betty Williams]]. It has however also been more than thirty years since Caernarfon has been represented by anyone other than Plaid Cymru.\n\nIn the event, Plaid gained the seat (which had been notionally Labour) in 2010 and held it in 2015; their victory in [[2017 United Kingdom general election|2017]] was by just 92 votes, the tightest margin in Wales in that election.\n\n== Members of Parliament ==\n\n===MPs 1885\u20131918===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | Election !!

Although the constituency is relatively large by geographical area, it is a predominantly urban rather than rural seat, with the majority  of the population living in the two towns on which the constituency is based, [[Bangor, Wales|Bangor]] and [[Caernarfon]].  \"Arfon\" is a historical name for the area, meaning \"facing Anglesey\"; it is also the name of the [[District of Arfon|former district council]]. This seat was created by the Welsh Boundary Commission in time for the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010 general election]], and replaced the old seat of [[Caernarfon (UK Parliament constituency)|Caernarfon]]. Bangor was in the old seat of [[Conwy (UK Parliament constituency)|Conwy]]. The same boundaries were used for the [[Arfon (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Arfon Welsh Assembly constituency]] in the [[2007 National Assembly for Wales election|2007 Welsh Assembly election]].\n\nIt is the smallest constituency on the mainland of Great Britain by electorate, and larger only than the two [[Scotland|Scottish]] island constituencies, [[Na h-Eileanan an Iar (UK Parliament constituency)|Na h-Eileanan an Iar]] and [[Orkney and Shetland (UK Parliament constituency)|Orkney and Shetland]]. The total population as of the 2011 census was 60,573.\n\nThe Arfon division of [[Caernarvonshire]] was a former UK Parliament constituency, which existed from 1885 until 1918. Before 1885 and after 1918 the area was part of the [[Caernarvonshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Caernarvonshire]] constituency. The Liberal MP William Rathbone represented the Arfon seat until 1895, followed by fellow Liberal William Jones. Upon the death of Mr Jones, Griffith C. Rees, for the Liberal Party, was elected unopposed at the subsequent by-election.<ref>Information in the paragraph is taken in part from F.W.S Craig's ''British Parliamentary Election Results 1885-1918'' (Macmillan, 1974).</ref>\n\n== Boundaries ==\nWhen first created in 1885, the constituency was defined as the Petty Sessional Divisions of Bangor, Conway and Nant-Conway, with the Parishes of Llanddeinilen and Llanberis (which were within the Carnarvon Petty Sessional Division). The constituency included the boroughs of Bangor and Conway which were part of the [[Caernarfon (UK Parliament constituency)|Carnarvon District of Boroughs]] constituency; only those who owned freehold land within the boroughs could vote in elections for the Arfon constituency as a second vote.\n\nThe new constituency was a merger of northern [[Caernarfon (UK Parliament constituency)|Caernarfon]] and western [[Conwy (UK Parliament constituency)|Conwy]].\nThe electoral wards used to create the current constituency are entirely within the preserved county of [[Gwynedd]]; They are Arllechwedd, Bethel, Bontnewydd, Cadnant, Cwm-y-Glo, Deiniol, Deiniolen, Dewi, Garth, Gerlan, Glyder, Groeslon, Hendre, Hirael, [[Llanberis]], Llanllyfni, Llanrug, Llanwnda, Marchog, [[Menai (ward)|Menai]] ([[Bangor, Wales|Bangor]]), [[Menai (Caernarfon ward)|Menai]] ([[Caernarfon]]), Ogwen, [[Peblig, Caernarfon|Peblig]], Penisarwaun, Pentir, Penygroes, [[Seiont (electoral ward)|Seiont]], Talysarn, Tregarth and Mynydd Llandygai, Waunfawr and Y Felinheli.\n\n== Electoral history (current constituency) ==\n\nThe latest boundary change created a battleground in Arfon particularly for Labour, Plaid Cymru, and the Conservatives, with the latter being labelled as a 'resurgent' party by the Caernarfon Herald.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.caernarfonherald.co.uk/caernarfon-county-news/local-caernarfon-news/2010/04/01/big-three-battle-to-win-arfon-seat-at-the-general-election-88817-26150947/ |title=Caernarfon Herald |publisher=Caernarfon Herald |accessdate=11 April 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100413185448/http://www.caernarfonherald.co.uk/caernarfon-county-news/local-caernarfon-news/2010/04/01/big-three-battle-to-win-arfon-seat-at-the-general-election-88817-26150947/| archivedate= 13 April 2010 | url-status= live}}</ref> The scale of contention had been reached due to the large shift in boundary changes which in turn has created a need within each party to achieve a relatively unforeseen outcome. Plaid Cymru had previously never represented Bangor, which had been held by Conservative [[Wyn Roberts]] for twenty-seven years and a further thirteen under Labour's [[Betty Williams (politician)|Betty Williams]]. It has however also been more than thirty years since Caernarfon has been represented by anyone other than Plaid Cymru.\n\nIn the event, Plaid gained the seat (which had been notionally Labour) in 2010 and held it in 2015; their victory in [[2017 United Kingdom general election|2017]] was by just 92 votes, the tightest margin in Wales in that election.\n\n== Members of Parliament ==\n\n===MPs 1885\u20131918===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | Election !!

It first opened for business on April 15, 1951, as \"The New London-Waterford Speed Bowl\", the track has been in continuous operation every season since it initially opened. It has continuously promoted [[Modified stock car racing]] as its featured division since its first year of operation.<ref>[http://speedbowlhistory.com/track-champions/modified-champions/  speedbowlhistory.com-Modified Champions]</ref>  It also holds family-oriented events such as the Wild N' Wacky Wednesday Series, Friday Show & Go drag racing and several Sunday Spectacular events throughout the year.  [[Glastonbury, Connecticut|Glastonbury]] businessman Bruce Bemer, won the track property via foreclosure auction bid in October 2014 after several seasons of financial struggles under former owner Terry Eames.  Former track champion Shawn Monahan was named the track's new General Manager in February 2015. It formerly operated under [[NASCAR]]'s [[Whelen All-American Series]] banner on Saturday nights. On April 6, 2017, [[NASCAR]] announced they ended their relationship with the New London-Waterford Speedbowl following the arrest of track owner Bruce Bemer for charges relating to sex trafficking.<ref>{{cite web|last1=McKeever|first1=Jim|last2=Roberts|first2=Laura|title=NASCAR ends relationship with New London-Waterford Speedbowl following owner\u2019s arrest|url=http://fox61.com/2017/04/06/nascar-ends-relationship-with-new-london-waterford-speedbowl/|website=FOX61|accessdate=April 7, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==History ==\n\n===Original ownership group===\nThe New London-Waterford Speedbowl opened on April 15, 1951, as a 1/3 mile crushed blue stone oval race track. Its ownership group, The New London-Waterford Speedbowl, Inc., was composed of local businessmen: brothers Fred and Frank Benvenuti, Anthony Albino, Conrad Nassetta, William Hoffner and J. Lawrence Peters. John Whitehouse was the track's first Race Director, a position he held through most of the original ownership group's tenure into the early 1970s.  Whitehouse lived in Florida during the winter and would then moved up north and stay in a house on the Speedbowl property during the racing season.  The Speedbowl featured Modified stock car racing, called Sportsmen Stock cars at the time. The first event winner was Bob Swift. After 3 weeks of operation, the dust created during green flag segments of racing became a nuisance to spectators.  The track closed for about a month and re-opened as an asphalt oval, which it remains today.<ref>[http://speedbowlhistory.com/1951-year-in-review/  speedbowlhistory.com 1951 Year in Review]</ref>\n\nThe one and only fatality as a result of injuries from an incident during a race occurred on August 1, 1954, when Jack Griffin's car flipped end-over-end approximately 10 times down the straightaway.  The 41-year-old was transported to the local hospital but was pronounced dead shortly after 1am the following morning.  His style of racecar, known as a \"cut-down\", was banned from the Speedbowl shortly thereafter for being too unsafe for competition.<ref>[http://speedbowlhistory.com/1954-year-in-review/  speedbowlhistory.com 1954 Year in Review]</ref>  In the coming years, the cut-downs were eventually banned throughout the northeast.\n\nThrough the 1961 season, the track held events twice a week, on Saturdays and Wednesdays, featuring the same divisions, meaning each division ran twice a week earning points towards the championship. Since the 1962, the Speedbowl's primary weekly divisions have raced once a week on Saturdays <ref>[http://speedbowlhistory.com/1962-year-in-review/  speedbowlhistory.com 1962 Year in Review]</ref>(although separate divisions and events have since been created over the years and compete exclusively on other days of the week)\n\nThe operating Board of Directors had some turnover through the years.  By 1960, Anthony Albino (now President) and Frank Benvenuti (Vice-President) were the only original owners still part of New London-Waterford Speedbowl, Inc.  About a year later, local businessmen Jack Brouwer and Lou Esposito bought into the track as minority owners.  By the early 1970s, the track ownership group consisted of Brouwer, Esposito and 2nd generation members Don Benvenuti and Bob Albino (who was the majority owner).  Internal conflict would lead to the group selling the track after the 1974 season, after a 24-year run operating as The New-London Waterford Speedbowl Inc.<ref>[http://speedbowlhistory.com/1974-year-in-review/  speedbowlhistory.com 1974 Year in Review]</ref>\n\nThe first Modified Champion at the Speedbowl was NEAR Hall of Famer Dave Humphrey,<ref>[http://speedbowlhistory.com/1951-year-in-review/  speedbowlhistory.com 1951 Year in Review]</ref> who also won the same title at the [[Seekonk Speedway]] that year, and would later win multiple titles in the [[Northeastern Midget Association|Northeastern Midget Association (NEMA)]] later in his career.<ref>[http://www.midgetmadness.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=11216  Midget Madness]</ref> Other big stars during the track's early days were 2-time Champion Bill Slater, 5-time Champion Don Collins, 4-time Champion Charlie Webster, Moe Gherzi, Melvin \"Red\" Foote, Newt Palm and Ted Stack.<ref>[http://speedbowlhistory.com/track-champions/modified-champions/  speedbowlhistory.com-Modified Champions]</ref>\n\n===Harvey Tattersall Jr. buys Speedbowl===\nPrior to the 1975 season, Harvey Tattersall Jr., long-time president of the United Stock Car Racing Association and one-time operator of the [[Riverside Park Speedway]] (among other tracks) bought the track from the previous ownership group. Tattersall had been one of the premiere racing promoters in the Northeast for two decades.  His ownership tenure saw him as promoter and Race Director in the first few years, then he leased the track out for most of the later years.\n\nTattersall revamped the structure of the supporting Late Model division when he took over in 1975, which was now called the Grand Americans.<ref>[http://speedbowlhistory.com/1975-year-in-review/  speedbowlhistory.com 1975 Year in Review]</ref> During his reign, Tattersall would lease the track to Dick Williams on two occasions. First in 1978,<ref>[http://speedbowlhistory.com/1978-year-in-review/  speedbowlhistory.com 1978 Year in Review]</ref> only for Tattersall take promoter duties back the following year, and then again in the early 1980s when Williams was actually operating four tracks at once, until focusing solely on the Waterford Speedbowl by the 1983 season <ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1915&dat=19830124&id=vAMhAAAAIBAJ&sjid=Z3UFAAAAIBAJ&pg=5553,4412243  Speedbowl Plans Purring on all 8-cylinders]</ref> Both Tattersall and Williams served as both the promoter and Race Director during their respective operational control of the track.\n\nIn 1983, legendary modified driver Ed Flemke became the Chief Steward at the Speedbowl, working with Dick Williams.<ref>[http://speedbowlhistory.com/1983-year-in-review/  speedbowlhistory.com 1983 Year in Review]</ref>  It was the last position in auto racing that Flemke held.  He died during the following off-season.  His position at the Speedbowl was not replaced.\n\nOne of the more star-studded events during this time was the Yankee All-Star League events that ran at the track from 1975-1978. Winners of these events at Waterford included future [[NASCAR Sprint Cup Series]] stars [[Geoff Bodine]], [[Ron Bouchard]] and [[Ken Bouchard]], NASCAR National Modified Champions Carl \"Bugsy\" Stevens and [[Fred DeSarro]] and legendary Long Island, NY Modified driver [[Charlie Jarzombek]]. NASCAR Hall of Famer [[Richie Evans]] competed in these events and a few others at the Speedbowl during his career before his death in 1985. The Waterford Speedbowl, however, is one of the few tracks that Evans raced at without ever recording a victory.<ref>[http://speedbowlhistory.com/special-features/major-events/yankee-all-star-league/  speedbowlhistory.com-Yankee All-Star League]</ref> The NASCAR Stroh's Late Model tour, run by Tom Curley, made two appearances at the track in 1982 & 1983.  Dave Dion won both events.\n\nStars on the track during this time were 4-time Modified Champion Dick Dunn, Bob Potter, George \"Moose\" Hewitt <ref>[http://speedbowlhistory.com/track-champions/modified-champions/  speedbowlhistory.com-Modified Champions]</ref> and Late Models racers Don Fowler, Bob Gada and Ron Cote <ref>[http://speedbowlhistory.com/track-champions/late-model-champions/  speedbowlhistory.com-Late Model Champions]</ref> among others.\n\n===Arute's 7A Productions===\nBy the end of the 1984 season, the track was enduring a tough time. The 1984 season was the only season which didn't have an end of the year banquet to celebrate its champions. But prior to the 1985 season, Tattersall leased the Speedbowl to the Arute family, who owned and operated the [[Stafford Motor Speedway]] in [[Stafford Springs, Connecticut|Stafford Springs]]. Two significant changes came during their reign as track operators: The headlining division was changed from the Modified division, to the upstart SK Modified division (at the time, the SK's were designed as a low-budget alternative to modified racing) and they also brought the NASCAR sanction to the track for the first time. The first SK Modified Champion at Waterford was future [[NASCAR Whelen Modified Tour]] Champion Rick Fuller, driving the Ted Marsh #55 car in 198<ref>[http://speedbowlhistory.com/1985-year-in-review/  speedbowlhistory.com 1985 Year in Review]</ref> The Arutes leased the track for 3 seasons, before leaving to once again focus solely on their family owned track in Stafford.\n\nAnother star who blossomed during the mid-1980s was Late Model driver Phil Rondeau of [[Baltic, Connecticut]]. He won a record 6 Late Model Championships in an 8-year span (1985, 1987\u201389, 1991\u201392) and recorded over 100 victories during his career that lasted into the early 2000s at the track. Rondeau was considered one of the top short track Late Model drivers in the Northeast during his time at Waterford. Other stars on the track in the 1980s included C.J. Frye and Brian McCarthy in the Late Model division <ref>[http://speedbowlhistory.com/track-champions/late-model-champions/  speedbowlhistory.com-Late Model Champions]</ref> and Rick Donnelly, Bob Potter, George \"Moose\" Hewitt and Dick Ceravolo in the Modifieds. Potter won 6 Championship between the Modified and SK Modified divisions in the 1970s & 1980's. Hewitt was a 5-time Modified Champion.<ref>[http://speedbowlhistory.com/track-champions/modified-champions/  speedbowlhistory.com-Modified Champions]</ref>\n\n===Korteweg's K Corporation===\nIn 1988, the Korteweg family took over track operations. Headed by father George and his sons Dan and Wayne, the Kortewegs invested a lot into track renovations, including the only repaving of the track's racing surface, new steel [[Armco barrier]] around the track, new catch fence and renovated restrooms and concession stands. A 3rd division was created in 1988 to support the SK Modified and Late Model divisions, called the Strictly Stocks - an entry level division of 8-cylinder stock cars. This division proved to be wildly popular.<ref>[http://speedbowlhistory.com/1988-year-in-review/  speedbowlhistory.com 1988 Year in Review]</ref>\n\nThe early 1990s brought some hurdles for the Korteweg family.  Local residents complained in numbers about the noise the facility generated during its events.  The track made it mandatory for all race cars to have mufflers in 1991.<ref>[http://articles.courant.com/1993-06-11/features/0000100879_1_noise-ordinance-decibel-level-track  Waterford Getting an Earful Over Noise]</ref> The town of Waterford did implement a noise ordinance in August 1993, but it excluded racing at the Speedbowl.<ref>[http://articles.courant.com/1993-08-06/features/0000006370_1_indycar-penske-racing-new-hampshire-international-speedway  Waterford is Left Out]</ref> During July 1991, the Speedbowl was endanger of closing its doors for one of its big events on July 4 weekend, when then-Connecticut Governor [[Lowell Weicker]] cut the state budget for non-essential jobs, including the DMV officials who regulated race events at all Connecticut tracks.<ref>[http://articles.courant.com/1991-07-04/features/0000214407_1_dmv-racing-tracks  Auto Racing Tracks Get Green Flag]</ref>  Less than 48 hours before the event, the state allowed DMV officials to the Speedbowl, however they would now be paid by the track directly.  Connecticut's DMV would no longer have any governing power over the events at the Speedbowl, which remains the case today.\n\nThroughout the 90's, more divisions were created. In 1995, the Mini Stock division (a former enduro-type division that ran on Sundays) was revamped as the 4-cylinder alternative to the Strictly Stock class.<ref>[http://speedbowlhistory.com/1995-year-in-review/  speedbowlhistory.com 1995 Year in Review]</ref> [[Legends car racing]], truck divisions and several other enduro-type divisions were also run on Sundays and then Thursdays throughout the decade.\n\nStars on the track during the 90's included Jerry Pearl, Dave Gada, Todd Ceravolo and future NASCAR [[Whelen Modified Tour]] Champion [[Ted Christopher]] in the SK Modified division;<ref>[http://speedbowlhistory.com/track-champions/modified-champions/  speedbowlhistory.com-Modified Champions]</ref> Phil Rondeau, Jay Stuart, Tom Fox and future [[K&N Pro Series East]] Champion [[Matt Kobyluck]] in the Late Model division;<ref>[http://speedbowlhistory.com/track-champions/late-model-champions/  speedbowlhistory.com-Late Model Champions]</ref> Glen Boss, Ed Reed Jr., Ken Cassidy and Chris \"Moose\" Douton in the Strictly Stock division;<ref>[http://speedbowlhistory.com/track-champions/street-stock-champions/  speedbowlhistory.com-Street Stock Champions]</ref>  Jeff Miller, Dan Darnstaedt and Bruce Thomas in the Mini Stock division.<ref>[http://speedbowlhistory.com/track-champions/mini-stock-champions/  speedbowlhistory.com-Mini Stock Champions]</ref>\n\n===Terry Eames buys Speedbowl===\nIn 2000, Terry Eames, who was the Speedbowl's promoter since the Korteweg's left the track in the mid-90s, became owner/operator and secured the return of the NASCAR sanction which had been removed in the late 1980s.<ref>[http://speedbowlhistory.com/2000-year-in-review/  speedbowlhistory.com 2000 Year in Review]</ref> In 2001, the Wild N' Wacky Wednesday series debuted featuring the Legends Cars as the headlining division along with enduro-type cars called Super X (8-cylinder) and X-cars (4-cylinder) for a weekly summer series that is largely family oriented and still popular to this day.<ref>[http://speedbowlhistory.com/2001-year-in-review/ speedbowlhistory.com 2001 Year in Review]</ref> It was around this time that the track was remeasured per NASCAR guidelines and officially declared a 0.375 (3/8) mile oval after a half-century of being recognized as a 0.333 (1/3) mile track.\n\nThe dominate driver in the SK Modifieds during this time was Dennis Gada, who won a record 5 straight Championships from 1999-2003 including the NASCAR Dodge Weekly Racing Series Northeast Regional title in 2003.<ref>[http://www.racingwest.com/news/articles/8032-mcfarland-nascar-dodge-weekly-series-champions.html  NASCAR Dodge Weekly Racing Champions Celebrate]</ref> Gada's 62 career SK wins at the track is also a record. During the early part of the decade the [[NASCAR Whelen Modified Tour]] and [[NASCAR Busch North Series|NASCAR Busch North/East Series]] visited the track annually.\n\nHowever, by the mid-2000s the track was falling on hard times. In 2006, Washington Mutual Bank initiated foreclosure proceedings against Eames. A year later, in late July 2007, a foreclosure auction was avoided when Connecticut businessmen Rocky Arbitell and Peter Borelli bought the note and refinanced with Eames directly. Washington Mutual Bank was now removed from the picture.<ref>[http://www.foreclosurelistings.com/content/foreclosures/foreclosed-homes/brakes-on-waterford-speedbowl-foreclosure.htm Brakes on Waterford Speedbowl Foreclosure]</ref> Eames continued as owner, but leased operational control of the track to Jerry Robinson of [[Mystic, Connecticut]], for the 2007\u201308 seasons.  Around this time, Harvey Industries bought 8 of the 39 acres from Eames and built a distribution center in what was the north end of the parking lot.\n\nStars during the first decade of the 2000s included: Dennis Gada, Jeff Pearl, Ron Yuhas Jr. and Rob Janovic Jr. in the SK Modifieds;<ref>[http://speedbowlhistory.com/track-champions/modified-champions/  speedbowlhistory.com-Modified Champions]</ref> Allen Coates, Corey Hutchings, Bruce Thomas Jr. and Tim Jordan in the Late Models <ref>[http://speedbowlhistory.com/track-champions/late-model-champions/  speedbowlhistory.com-Late Model Champions]</ref> Ed Gertsch Jr., Dwayne Dorr, Walt Hovey Jr. and Al Stone III in the Street Stocks;<ref>[http://speedbowlhistory.com/track-champions/street-stock-champions/  speedbowlhistory.com-Street Stock Champions]</ref>   Danny Field, Phil Evans and Ken Cassidy Jr. in the Mini Stocks.<ref>[http://speedbowlhistory.com/track-champions/mini-stock-champions/  speedbowlhistory.com-Mini Stock Champions]</ref> Regional Modified/SK Modified drivers who started out in the Speedbowl's Legends Car division during this time include James Civali, Chris Pasteryak, Mark Bakaj and Jeffrey Paul.\n\n===New board of directors era===\nIn 2009, Terry Eames took back operational control of the track when Robinson's lease was not renewed.<ref>[http://blogs.courant.com/autoracing/2008/11/as-the-speedbowl-management-tu.html As the Speedbowl Management Turns]</ref> Now the promoter once again, Eames formed a new Board of Directors which included former competitor and 2-time Speedbowl Champion Tom Fox as Race Director, former Mini Stock competitor Mark Caise and local supporter Brian Darling. The original group also featured former Street Stock Champion Shawn Monahan as a joint operator of the track <ref>[http://blogs.courant.com/autoracing/2008/12/center-stage-monday-night-for.html  Center Stage for Speedbowl]</ref> and track historian Tom \"Sid\" DiMaggio in a multimedia capacity. However, by February 2009, Shawn Monahan resigned from his post sighting differences in the operational agreement with Eames and returned to racing shortly thereafter.<ref>[http://blogs.courant.com/autoracing/2009/01/saying-goodbye-shawn-monahan-q.html  Shawn Monahan Quickly Gone..]</ref> DiMaggio resigned 3 days later, although he continues as the track's active historian and part of the track's social media presence via his production company's video work.<ref>http://www.sidsview.com</ref>  Fox would resign as Race Director after the 2010 season and Scott Tapley was named as his replacement at the 2010 awards banquet ceremony in January 2011.  Shortly after the 2012 season ended, Tapley then resigned to take the Race Director position with the Valenti Modified Racing Series.<ref>http://www.racedayct.com/2012/11/scott-tapley-leaving-waterford-speedbowl-to-become-new-valenti-modified-racing-series-race-director/</ref>  Track owner & promoter Terry Eames took over the Race Director duties for the 2013 season, the first promoter to do so since Dick Williams in 1984.  Former X-Car Champion Patrick Williams took over Race Director duties in 2014.  In addition to the turnover with officials, the foreclosure issues were dragged out in the courts, with each season since 2006 ending with a cloud of doubt towards the facility's long-term future.\n\nThe Speedbowl's current divisions are SK Modifieds, Late Models, SK Lights, Street Stocks and Mini Stocks. Legend Cars also compete sporadically throughout the Saturday season. The Wild N' Wacky Wednesday series continues to be a successful mid-week series during the summer that features Legends Cars and Bandoleros (for drivers as young as 6-years old), Super-X cars and X-cars and various \"wacky\" races throughout their season.\n\nCurrent touring divisions that visit the track each year include the [[International Supermodified Association|ISMA Super Modifieds]], the Valenti Modified Racing Series, the [[Northeastern Midget Association|NEMA Midgets]], the Northeast Trucks Series (NETS) and the Pro4 Modifieds.\n\nKeith Rocco, who also competes at the Stafford Motor Speedway and Thompson International Speedway, clinched the [[NASCAR Whelen All-American Series]] National Championship at the Speedbowl on August 14, 2010.<ref>[http://www.speedbowl.com/news.php?subaction=showfull&id=1281836848&archive=&start_from=&ucat=1&  Rocco wins NASCAR National title]</ref> He became the first driver to win a NASCAR National Championship while an active weekly competitor at the Waterford Speedbowl. In 2012, the Speedbowl was the hometrack to three National Champions: Ken Cassidy Jr., who won his 4th Mini Stock Championship with a record 12-win season, also won the NASCAR Division III (Asphalt) National Championship.<ref>http://www.racedayct.com/2012/10/ken-cassidy-closes-out-dazzling-season-with-historic-mini-stock-win-at-waterford/</ref>  Wednesday Legends Champion Dave Garbo Jr. was the INEX Legends Car Semi-Pro (Asphalt) National Championship.  Matt Pappa, of NY, who won 11 times at the Speedbowl in 2012, won the INEX Legends Car Pro (Asphalt) National Championship.  In 2013, Keith Rocco became the first driver to win 2 track championships in 2 different divisions when he won both the SK Modified & Late Models titles.  In 2014, he did it again tying Dennis Gada for most Track Championships (7) in track history.\n\n===New owner Bruce Bemer===\nOn October 18, 2014, a foreclosure auction was held on the Speedbowl property. It was held on the same date as the annual 'Smacktoberfest' event which closes the racing season. There were approximately 100 people in attendance, with four registered bidders.  The winning bid of $1.75 million came from Glastonbury, Connecticut, businessman Bruce Bemer, whose group immediately announced they intended to keep it a racetrack.<ref>http://racedayct.com/2014/10/green-flag-waterford-speedbowl-expected-to-remain-race-track-following-foreclosure-auction/</ref>  However, the total debt that brought about the foreclosure auction was over $2 million, meaning not all the creditors owed money would be paid.  One creditor, Ed DeMuzzio, filed motions (including a motion to reconsider and an appeal) in hopes to recoup some of his money.<ref>http://racedayct.com/2014/12/creditor-files-motion-for-reconsideration-of-approval-of-foreclosure-auction-sale-of-waterford-speedbowl/</ref> After months of negotiations between all parties involved, in early February 2015, a resolution was reached, the appeal was withdrawn and the sale was finally approved by the courts.<ref>http://racedayct.com/2015/02/start-your-engines-settlement-reached-in-waterford-speedbowl-foreclosure-case/</ref>\n\nShortly afterward, Shawn Monahan was named as the new GM of the Speedbowl \u2013 six years after his first opportunity in a similar role with Terry Eames.<ref>http://racedayct.com/2015/02/breaking-shawn-monahan-named-gm-of-waterford-speedbowl-scott-tapley-named-racing-director/</ref>  Scott Tapley was also announced as the new Race Director.  One of their earliest announcements was a change back to the track's original name, \"The New London-Waterford Speedbowl\".\n\nIn 2017 Bruce Bemer was arrested for participating a sex ring and human trafficking involving troubled young men and men with mental disabilities.<ref>http://www.courant.com/news/connecticut/hc-news-bruce-bemer-appearance-20180131-story.html</ref>. NASCAR pulled its sanction for the track's weekly Saturday divisions shortly afterward <ref>https://www.wtnh.com/news/connecticut/new-london/nascar-terminates-sanctions-with-new-london-waterford-speedbowl/1068395854</ref>. INEX pulled its sanction for the [[US Legend Cars]] and Bandolero divisions as well.  The track wasn't going to open but in 2017 but a lease deal was worked out to open the track with George Whitney managing the day-to-day of the track. <ref>http://www.norwichbulletin.com/sports/20170606/speedbowl-agreement-reached-to-lease-reopen-track-for-2017-season</ref>.  Whitney operated the track until September of 2018, when he terminated his lease with Bemer with 4 weeks left in the season <ref>http://racedayct.com/2018/09/racing-to-continue-in-2018-at-speedbowl-george-whitney-out-as-operator/</ref>.  Mike Serluca leased the track for the remainder of the 2018 season.\n\nThe track's main grandstand, dating to 1951, was required to be replaced by the town of Waterford and were dismantled after the 2018 season.   New stands are on site but were not erected in time, and the speedway did not open for competition in 2019.  Mike Serluca remains in place as the track's General Manager, and the track anticipates reopening when construction is complete.\n\n[[File:BrianOuimetteHerocardVPback.jpg|thumb|Brian Ouimette at the Waterford Speedbowl.]]\n\n==In media==\n*New York DJ, producer and radio host [[Funkmaster Flex]] wanted to explore his passion for car racing and developed a unique way to get it done with a new [[Spike TV]] show race event called The Funkmaster Flex Super Series Invitational. The race featured 60 hungry late model stock car drivers from across the country turning laps at the Waterford Speedbowl. Flex went behind the scene to see what it takes to become a winner in racing while bringing out celebrities like [[Orange County Choppers]], who paced the field before the start of the race on their choppers, [[Lil' Kim]] who wove the initial green flag as the honorary starter and [[LL Cool J]], who gave a short performance to the crowd after the event.. You can view the YouTube link of the show's opening sequence here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzhrhu2sNlc Monica Taylor Enterprise - Rare Footage of Super Series]  The event was held on Thursday August 5, 2004.  Among those who were invited to qualify for the event included current [[NASCAR]] [[Whelen Modified Tour]] competitors Ted Christopher, Doug Coby and Woody Pitkat.<ref>http://www.techracing.com/NewsPages/2004/tc7-1.htm</ref>  During the late stages of the race, 6-time Speedbowl Late Model Champion Phil Rondeau was called for spinning race leader Ted Christopher with less than 20 laps to go.  3-time Speedbowl LM Champ Allen Coates inherited the lead and held off Woody Pitkat over the final laps to take the win.  Coates won $10,000 and a vintage 1969 Camaro for his victory.  Pitkat took home $6,000 for second and Rondeau $4,000 for third.  The event was billed as having $100,000 in total purse and awards.  The crowd was estimated at around 8,000 people, making it one of the most attended events in the history of the facility.<ref>http://articles.courant.com/2004-08-06/features/0408060755_1_lil-great-race-orange-county-choppers</ref>  Although there were early discussions for this to be a yearly event, Funkmaster Flex never returned to the Speedbowl to continue the series.\n*In the summer of 2005, [[NESN]] debuted a series called \"Inside Line\" that was a reality based show focusing on local racing in the Northeast.<ref>http://www.persistencemedia.com/news/release-inside-line.php</ref> Ted Christopher, one of the premier Modified drivers and former SK Modified Champion at the Speedbowl was one of the people profiled in an early episode of the short-lived series.  Much of the raceday footage used was shot at the Speedbowl on June 25, 2005, when Christopher competed in both the weekly SK Modified 35 lap event and the NASCAR Whelen Modified Tour 150 event. His twin brother Mike, engine builder Mike Pettit, and fellow competitors Doug Coby, Chris Pasteryak and the late Jay Miller were some of the people who had appearances in the episode as well.\n*The Speedbowl was highlighted on the [[Discovery Channel]] network's show [[Destroyed in Seconds]].<ref>http://www.livedash.com/transcript/destroyed_in_seconds/6222/DSCP/Thursday_January_21_2010/172502/</ref>  Originally airing on February 16, 2009, a segment of the show was dedicated to a wreck during a Late Model event held a few years earlier on Saturday July 8, 2006.  Jay Lozyniak's #28 car barrell-rolled down the front straightaway during a multi-car wreck in turn 4.  Most of the footage shown was recorded by Jay's mother in the stands while it happened.  Jay, and all other drivers involved that night, were not seriously injured.  The race was red-checkered after only 18 of the 30 laps were completed.  Only five cars were able to continue after the incident.  Glenn Colvin, who was the highest positioned car not involved in the wreck, was declared the winner.<ref>http://www.sids-vault.com/stats.php?a=1&b=6&c=7&d=2</ref>\n*The 2011 film 3 Weeks to Daytona, written & directed by [[Fairfield, CT]] native Bret Stern,<ref>http://www.fairfieldcitizenonline.com/news/article/Racer-s-dreams-fuel-inspiration-for-Fairfielder-s-1323625.php</ref>  was shot in several locations throughout the state, including the Waterford Speedbowl. In an interview with the website [[indieWire]], Stern stated \"I was inspired to make the film after watching cars race at the Speedbowl in Waterford, Connecticut. I'd go Saturday night to see races.

It has continuously promoted [[Modified stock car racing]] as its featured division since its first year of operation.<ref>[http://speedbowlhistory.com/track-champions/modified-champions/  speedbowlhistory.com-Modified Champions]</ref>  It also holds family-oriented events such as the Wild N' Wacky Wednesday Series, Friday Show & Go drag racing and several Sunday Spectacular events throughout the year.  [[Glastonbury, Connecticut|Glastonbury]] businessman Bruce Bemer, won the track property via foreclosure auction bid in October 2014 after several seasons of financial struggles under former owner Terry Eames.  Former track champion Shawn Monahan was named the track's new General Manager in February 2015. It formerly operated under [[NASCAR]]'s [[Whelen All-American Series]] banner on Saturday nights. On April 6, 2017, [[NASCAR]] announced they ended their relationship with the New London-Waterford Speedbowl following the arrest of track owner Bruce Bemer for charges relating to sex trafficking.<ref>{{cite web|last1=McKeever|first1=Jim|last2=Roberts|first2=Laura|title=NASCAR ends relationship with New London-Waterford Speedbowl following owner\u2019s arrest|url=http://fox61.com/2017/04/06/nascar-ends-relationship-with-new-london-waterford-speedbowl/|website=FOX61|accessdate=April 7, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==History ==\n\n===Original ownership group===\nThe New London-Waterford Speedbowl opened on April 15, 1951, as a 1/3 mile crushed blue stone oval race track. Its ownership group, The New London-Waterford Speedbowl, Inc., was composed of local businessmen: brothers Fred and Frank Benvenuti, Anthony Albino, Conrad Nassetta, William Hoffner and J. Lawrence Peters. John Whitehouse was the track's first Race Director, a position he held through most of the original ownership group's tenure into the early 1970s.  Whitehouse lived in Florida during the winter and would then moved up north and stay in a house on the Speedbowl property during the racing season.  The Speedbowl featured Modified stock car racing, called Sportsmen Stock cars at the time. The first event winner was Bob Swift. After 3 weeks of operation, the dust created during green flag segments of racing became a nuisance to spectators.  The track closed for about a month and re-opened as an asphalt oval, which it remains today.<ref>[http://speedbowlhistory.com/1951-year-in-review/  speedbowlhistory.com 1951 Year in Review]</ref>\n\nThe one and only fatality as a result of injuries from an incident during a race occurred on August 1, 1954, when Jack Griffin's car flipped end-over-end approximately 10 times down the straightaway.  The 41-year-old was transported to the local hospital but was pronounced dead shortly after 1am the following morning.  His style of racecar, known as a \"cut-down\", was banned from the Speedbowl shortly thereafter for being too unsafe for competition.<ref>[http://speedbowlhistory.com/1954-year-in-review/  speedbowlhistory.com 1954 Year in Review]</ref>  In the coming years, the cut-downs were eventually banned throughout the northeast.\n\nThrough the 1961 season, the track held events twice a week, on Saturdays and Wednesdays, featuring the same divisions, meaning each division ran twice a week earning points towards the championship. Since the 1962, the Speedbowl's primary weekly divisions have raced once a week on Saturdays <ref>[http://speedbowlhistory.com/1962-year-in-review/  speedbowlhistory.com 1962 Year in Review]</ref>(although separate divisions and events have since been created over the years and compete exclusively on other days of the week)\n\nThe operating Board of Directors had some turnover through the years.  By 1960, Anthony Albino (now President) and Frank Benvenuti (Vice-President) were the only original owners still part of New London-Waterford Speedbowl, Inc.  About a year later, local businessmen Jack Brouwer and Lou Esposito bought into the track as minority owners.  By the early 1970s, the track ownership group consisted of Brouwer, Esposito and 2nd generation members Don Benvenuti and Bob Albino (who was the majority owner).  Internal conflict would lead to the group selling the track after the 1974 season, after a 24-year run operating as The New-London Waterford Speedbowl Inc.<ref>[http://speedbowlhistory.com/1974-year-in-review/  speedbowlhistory.com 1974 Year in Review]</ref>\n\nThe first Modified Champion at the Speedbowl was NEAR Hall of Famer Dave Humphrey,<ref>[http://speedbowlhistory.com/1951-year-in-review/  speedbowlhistory.com 1951 Year in Review]</ref> who also won the same title at the [[Seekonk Speedway]] that year, and would later win multiple titles in the [[Northeastern Midget Association|Northeastern Midget Association (NEMA)]] later in his career.<ref>[http://www.midgetmadness.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=11216  Midget Madness]</ref> Other big stars during the track's early days were 2-time Champion Bill Slater, 5-time Champion Don Collins, 4-time Champion Charlie Webster, Moe Gherzi, Melvin \"Red\" Foote, Newt Palm and Ted Stack.<ref>[http://speedbowlhistory.com/track-champions/modified-champions/  speedbowlhistory.com-Modified Champions]</ref>\n\n===Harvey Tattersall Jr. buys Speedbowl===\nPrior to the 1975 season, Harvey Tattersall Jr., long-time president of the United Stock Car Racing Association and one-time operator of the [[Riverside Park Speedway]] (among other tracks) bought the track from the previous ownership group. Tattersall had been one of the premiere racing promoters in the Northeast for two decades.  His ownership tenure saw him as promoter and Race Director in the first few years, then he leased the track out for most of the later years.\n\nTattersall revamped the structure of the supporting Late Model division when he took over in 1975, which was now called the Grand Americans.<ref>[http://speedbowlhistory.com/1975-year-in-review/  speedbowlhistory.com 1975 Year in Review]</ref> During his reign, Tattersall would lease the track to Dick Williams on two occasions. First in 1978,<ref>[http://speedbowlhistory.com/1978-year-in-review/  speedbowlhistory.com 1978 Year in Review]</ref> only for Tattersall take promoter duties back the following year, and then again in the early 1980s when Williams was actually operating four tracks at once, until focusing solely on the Waterford Speedbowl by the 1983 season <ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1915&dat=19830124&id=vAMhAAAAIBAJ&sjid=Z3UFAAAAIBAJ&pg=5553,4412243  Speedbowl Plans Purring on all 8-cylinders]</ref> Both Tattersall and Williams served as both the promoter and Race Director during their respective operational control of the track.\n\nIn 1983, legendary modified driver Ed Flemke became the Chief Steward at the Speedbowl, working with Dick Williams.<ref>[http://speedbowlhistory.com/1983-year-in-review/  speedbowlhistory.com 1983 Year in Review]</ref>  It was the last position in auto racing that Flemke held.  He died during the following off-season.  His position at the Speedbowl was not replaced.\n\nOne of the more star-studded events during this time was the Yankee All-Star League events that ran at the track from 1975-1978. Winners of these events at Waterford included future [[NASCAR Sprint Cup Series]] stars [[Geoff Bodine]], [[Ron Bouchard]] and [[Ken Bouchard]], NASCAR National Modified Champions Carl \"Bugsy\" Stevens and [[Fred DeSarro]] and legendary Long Island, NY Modified driver [[Charlie Jarzombek]]. NASCAR Hall of Famer [[Richie Evans]] competed in these events and a few others at the Speedbowl during his career before his death in 1985. The Waterford Speedbowl, however, is one of the few tracks that Evans raced at without ever recording a victory.<ref>[http://speedbowlhistory.com/special-features/major-events/yankee-all-star-league/  speedbowlhistory.com-Yankee All-Star League]</ref>  The NASCAR Stroh's Late Model tour, run by Tom Curley, made two appearances at the track in 1982 & 1983.  Dave Dion won both events.\n\nStars on the track during this time were 4-time Modified Champion Dick Dunn, Bob Potter, George \"Moose\" Hewitt <ref>[http://speedbowlhistory.com/track-champions/modified-champions/  speedbowlhistory.com-Modified Champions]</ref> and Late Models racers Don Fowler, Bob Gada and Ron Cote <ref>[http://speedbowlhistory.com/track-champions/late-model-champions/  speedbowlhistory.com-Late Model Champions]</ref> among others.\n\n===Arute's 7A Productions===\nBy the end of the 1984 season, the track was enduring a tough time. The 1984 season was the only season which didn't have an end of the year banquet to celebrate its champions. But prior to the 1985 season, Tattersall leased the Speedbowl to the Arute family, who owned and operated the [[Stafford Motor Speedway]] in [[Stafford Springs, Connecticut|Stafford Springs]]. Two significant changes came during their reign as track operators: The headlining division was changed from the Modified division, to the upstart SK Modified division (at the time, the SK's were designed as a low-budget alternative to modified racing) and they also brought the NASCAR sanction to the track for the first time. The first SK Modified Champion at Waterford was future [[NASCAR Whelen Modified Tour]] Champion Rick Fuller, driving the Ted Marsh #55 car in 198<ref>[http://speedbowlhistory.com/1985-year-in-review/  speedbowlhistory.com 1985 Year in Review]</ref> The Arutes leased the track for 3 seasons, before leaving to once again focus solely on their family owned track in Stafford.\n\nAnother star who blossomed during the mid-1980s was Late Model driver Phil Rondeau of [[Baltic, Connecticut]]. He won a record 6 Late Model Championships in an 8-year span (1985, 1987\u201389, 1991\u201392) and recorded over 100 victories during his career that lasted into the early 2000s at the track. Rondeau was considered one of the top short track Late Model drivers in the Northeast during his time at Waterford. Other stars on the track in the 1980s included C.J. Frye and Brian McCarthy in the Late Model division <ref>[http://speedbowlhistory.com/track-champions/late-model-champions/  speedbowlhistory.com-Late Model Champions]</ref> and Rick Donnelly, Bob Potter, George \"Moose\" Hewitt and Dick Ceravolo in the Modifieds. Potter won 6 Championship between the Modified and SK Modified divisions in the 1970s & 1980's. Hewitt was a 5-time Modified Champion.<ref>[http://speedbowlhistory.com/track-champions/modified-champions/  speedbowlhistory.com-Modified Champions]</ref>\n\n===Korteweg's K Corporation===\nIn 1988, the Korteweg family took over track operations. Headed by father George and his sons Dan and Wayne, the Kortewegs invested a lot into track renovations, including the only repaving of the track's racing surface, new steel [[Armco barrier]] around the track, new catch fence and renovated restrooms and concession stands. A 3rd division was created in 1988 to support the SK Modified and Late Model divisions, called the Strictly Stocks - an entry level division of 8-cylinder stock cars. This division proved to be wildly popular.<ref>[http://speedbowlhistory.com/1988-year-in-review/  speedbowlhistory.com 1988 Year in Review]</ref>\n\nThe early 1990s brought some hurdles for the Korteweg family.  Local residents complained in numbers about the noise the facility generated during its events.  The track made it mandatory for all race cars to have mufflers in 1991.<ref>[http://articles.courant.com/1993-06-11/features/0000100879_1_noise-ordinance-decibel-level-track  Waterford Getting an Earful Over Noise]</ref> The town of Waterford did implement a noise ordinance in August 1993, but it excluded racing at the Speedbowl.<ref>[http://articles.courant.com/1993-08-06/features/0000006370_1_indycar-penske-racing-new-hampshire-international-speedway  Waterford is Left Out]</ref> During July 1991, the Speedbowl was endanger of closing its doors for one of its big events on July 4 weekend, when then-Connecticut Governor [[Lowell Weicker]] cut the state budget for non-essential jobs, including the DMV officials who regulated race events at all Connecticut tracks.<ref>[http://articles.courant.com/1991-07-04/features/0000214407_1_dmv-racing-tracks  Auto Racing Tracks Get Green Flag]</ref>  Less than 48 hours before the event, the state allowed DMV officials to the Speedbowl, however they would now be paid by the track directly.  Connecticut's DMV would no longer have any governing power over the events at the Speedbowl, which remains the case today.\n\nThroughout the 90's, more divisions were created. In 1995, the Mini Stock division (a former enduro-type division that ran on Sundays) was revamped as the 4-cylinder alternative to the Strictly Stock class.<ref>[http://speedbowlhistory.com/1995-year-in-review/  speedbowlhistory.com 1995 Year in Review]</ref> [[Legends car racing]], truck divisions and several other enduro-type divisions were also run on Sundays and then Thursdays throughout the decade.\n\nStars on the track during the 90's included Jerry Pearl, Dave Gada, Todd Ceravolo and future NASCAR [[Whelen Modified Tour]] Champion [[Ted Christopher]] in the SK Modified division;<ref>[http://speedbowlhistory.com/track-champions/modified-champions/  speedbowlhistory.com-Modified Champions]</ref> Phil Rondeau, Jay Stuart, Tom Fox and future [[K&N Pro Series East]] Champion [[Matt Kobyluck]] in the Late Model division;<ref>[http://speedbowlhistory.com/track-champions/late-model-champions/  speedbowlhistory.com-Late Model Champions]</ref> Glen Boss, Ed Reed Jr., Ken Cassidy and Chris \"Moose\" Douton in the Strictly Stock division;<ref>[http://speedbowlhistory.com/track-champions/street-stock-champions/  speedbowlhistory.com-Street Stock Champions]</ref>  Jeff Miller, Dan Darnstaedt and Bruce Thomas in the Mini Stock division.<ref>[http://speedbowlhistory.com/track-champions/mini-stock-champions/  speedbowlhistory.com-Mini Stock Champions]</ref>\n\n===Terry Eames buys Speedbowl===\nIn 2000, Terry Eames, who was the Speedbowl's promoter since the Korteweg's left the track in the mid-90s, became owner/operator and secured the return of the NASCAR sanction which had been removed in the late 1980s.<ref>[http://speedbowlhistory.com/2000-year-in-review/  speedbowlhistory.com 2000 Year in Review]</ref> In 2001, the Wild N' Wacky Wednesday series debuted featuring the Legends Cars as the headlining division along with enduro-type cars called Super X (8-cylinder) and X-cars (4-cylinder) for a weekly summer series that is largely family oriented and still popular to this day.<ref>[http://speedbowlhistory.com/2001-year-in-review/ speedbowlhistory.com 2001 Year in Review]</ref> It was around this time that the track was remeasured per NASCAR guidelines and officially declared a 0.375 (3/8) mile oval after a half-century of being recognized as a 0.333 (1/3) mile track.\n\nThe dominate driver in the SK Modifieds during this time was Dennis Gada, who won a record 5 straight Championships from 1999-2003 including the NASCAR Dodge Weekly Racing Series Northeast Regional title in 2003.<ref>[http://www.racingwest.com/news/articles/8032-mcfarland-nascar-dodge-weekly-series-champions.html  NASCAR Dodge Weekly Racing Champions Celebrate]</ref> Gada's 62 career SK wins at the track is also a record. During the early part of the decade the NASCAR Whelen Modified Tour and NASCAR Busch North/East series visited the track annually.\n\nHowever, by the mid-2000s the track was falling on hard times. In 2006, Washington Mutual Bank initiated foreclosure proceedings against Eames. A year later, in late July 2007, a foreclosure auction was avoided when Connecticut businessmen Rocky Arbitell and Peter Borelli bought the note and refinanced with Eames directly. Washington Mutual Bank was now removed from the picture.<ref>[http://www.foreclosurelistings.com/content/foreclosures/foreclosed-homes/brakes-on-waterford-speedbowl-foreclosure.htm Brakes on Waterford Speedbowl Foreclosure]</ref> Eames continued as owner, but leased operational control of the track to Jerry Robinson of [[Mystic, Connecticut]], for the 2007\u201308 seasons.  Around this time, Harvey Industries bought 8 of the 39 acres from Eames and built a distribution center in what was the north end of the parking lot.\n\nStars during the first decade of the 2000s included: Dennis Gada, Jeff Pearl, Ron Yuhas Jr. and Rob Janovic Jr. in the SK Modifieds;<ref>[http://speedbowlhistory.com/track-champions/modified-champions/  speedbowlhistory.com-Modified Champions]</ref> Allen Coates, Corey Hutchings, Bruce Thomas Jr. and Tim Jordan in the Late Models <ref>[http://speedbowlhistory.com/track-champions/late-model-champions/  speedbowlhistory.com-Late Model Champions]</ref> Ed Gertsch Jr., Dwayne Dorr, Walt Hovey Jr. and Al Stone III in the Street Stocks;<ref>[http://speedbowlhistory.com/track-champions/street-stock-champions/  speedbowlhistory.com-Street Stock Champions]</ref>   Danny Field, Phil Evans and Ken Cassidy Jr. in the Mini Stocks.<ref>[http://speedbowlhistory.com/track-champions/mini-stock-champions/  speedbowlhistory.com-Mini Stock Champions]</ref> Regional Modified/SK Modified drivers who started out in the Speedbowl's Legends Car division during this time include James Civali, Chris Pasteryak, Mark Bakaj and Jeffrey Paul.\n\n===New board of directors era===\nIn 2009, Terry Eames took back operational control of the track when Robinson's lease was not renewed.<ref>[http://blogs.courant.com/autoracing/2008/11/as-the-speedbowl-management-tu.html As the Speedbowl Management Turns]</ref> Now the promoter once again, Eames formed a new Board of Directors which included former competitor and 2-time Speedbowl Champion Tom Fox as Race Director, former Mini Stock competitor Mark Caise and local supporter Brian Darling. The original group also featured former Street Stock Champion Shawn Monahan as a joint operator of the track <ref>[http://blogs.courant.com/autoracing/2008/12/center-stage-monday-night-for.html  Center Stage for Speedbowl]</ref> and track historian Tom \"Sid\" DiMaggio in a multimedia capacity. However, by February 2009, Shawn Monahan resigned from his post sighting differences in the operational agreement with Eames and returned to racing shortly thereafter.<ref>[http://blogs.courant.com/autoracing/2009/01/saying-goodbye-shawn-monahan-q.html  Shawn Monahan Quickly Gone..]</ref> DiMaggio resigned 3 days later, although he continues as the track's active historian and part of the track's social media presence via his production company's video work.<ref>http://www.sidsview.com</ref>  Fox would resign as Race Director after the 2010 season and Scott Tapley was named as his replacement at the 2010 awards banquet ceremony in January 2011.  Shortly after the 2012 season ended, Tapley then resigned to take the Race Director position with the Valenti Modified Racing Series.<ref>http://www.racedayct.com/2012/11/scott-tapley-leaving-waterford-speedbowl-to-become-new-valenti-modified-racing-series-race-director/</ref>  Track owner & promoter Terry Eames took over the Race Director duties for the 2013 season, the first promoter to do so since Dick Williams in 1984.  Former X-Car Champion Patrick Williams took over Race Director duties in 2014.  In addition to the turnover with officials, the foreclosure issues were dragged out in the courts, with each season since 2006 ending with a cloud of doubt towards the facility's long-term future.\n\nThe Speedbowl's current divisions are SK Modifieds, Late Models, SK Lights, Street Stocks and Mini Stocks. Legend Cars also compete sporadically throughout the Saturday season. The Wild N' Wacky Wednesday series continues to be a successful mid-week series during the summer that features Legends Cars and Bandoleros (for drivers as young as 6-years old), Super-X cars and X-cars and various \"wacky\" races throughout their season.\n\nCurrent touring divisions that visit the track each year include the [[International Supermodified Association|ISMA Super Modifieds]], the Valenti Modified Racing Series, the [[Northeastern Midget Association|NEMA Midgets]], the Northeast Trucks Series (NETS) and the Pro4 Modifieds.\n\nKeith Rocco, who also competes at the Stafford Motor Speedway and Thompson International Speedway, clinched the NASCAR Whelen All-American Series National Championship at the Speedbowl on August 14, 2010.<ref>[http://www.speedbowl.com/news.php?subaction=showfull&id=1281836848&archive=&start_from=&ucat=1&  Rocco wins NASCAR National title]</ref> He became the first driver to win a NASCAR National Championship while an active weekly competitor at the Waterford Speedbowl.  In 2012, the Speedbowl was the hometrack to three National Champions: Ken Cassidy Jr., who won his 4th Mini Stock Championship with a record 12-win season, also won the NASCAR Division III (Asphalt) National Championship.<ref>http://www.racedayct.com/2012/10/ken-cassidy-closes-out-dazzling-season-with-historic-mini-stock-win-at-waterford/</ref>  Wednesday Legends Champion Dave Garbo Jr. was the INEX Legends Car Semi-Pro (Asphalt) National Championship.  Matt Pappa, of NY, who won 11 times at the Speedbowl in 2012, won the INEX Legends Car Pro (Asphalt) National Championship.  In 2013, Keith Rocco became the first driver to win 2 track championships in 2 different divisions when he won both the SK Modified & Late Models titles.  In 2014, he did it again tying Dennis Gada for most Track Championships (7) in track history.\n\n===New owner Bruce Bemer===\nOn October 18, 2014, a foreclosure auction was held on the Speedbowl property. It was held on the same date as the annual 'Smacktoberfest' event which closes the racing season. There were approximately 100 people in attendance, with four registered bidders.  The winning bid of $1.75 million came from Glastonbury, Connecticut, businessman Bruce Bemer, whose group immediately announced they intended to keep it a racetrack.<ref>http://racedayct.com/2014/10/green-flag-waterford-speedbowl-expected-to-remain-race-track-following-foreclosure-auction/</ref>  However, the total debt that brought about the foreclosure auction was over $2 million, meaning not all the creditors owed money would be paid.  One creditor, Ed DeMuzzio, filed motions (including a motion to reconsider and an appeal) in hopes to recoup some of his money.<ref>http://racedayct.com/2014/12/creditor-files-motion-for-reconsideration-of-approval-of-foreclosure-auction-sale-of-waterford-speedbowl/</ref> After months of negotiations between all parties involved, in early February 2015, a resolution was reached, the appeal was withdrawn and the sale was finally approved by the courts.<ref>http://racedayct.com/2015/02/start-your-engines-settlement-reached-in-waterford-speedbowl-foreclosure-case/</ref>\n\nShortly afterward, Shawn Monahan was named as the new GM of the Speedbowl \u2013 six years after his first opportunity in a similar role with Terry Eames.<ref>http://racedayct.com/2015/02/breaking-shawn-monahan-named-gm-of-waterford-speedbowl-scott-tapley-named-racing-director/</ref>  Scott Tapley was also announced as the new Race Director.  One of their earliest announcements was a change back to the track's original name, \"The New London-Waterford Speedbowl\".\n\nIn 2017 Bruce Bemer was arrested for participating a sex ring and human trafficking involving troubled young men and men with mental disabilities.<ref>http://www.courant.com/news/connecticut/hc-news-bruce-bemer-appearance-20180131-story.html</ref>.  NASCAR pulled its sanction for the track's weekly Saturday divisions shortly afterward <ref>https://www.wtnh.com/news/connecticut/new-london/nascar-terminates-sanctions-with-new-london-waterford-speedbowl/1068395854</ref>. INEX pulled its sanction for the [[US Legend Cars]] and Bandolero divisions as well.  The track wasn't going to open but in 2017 but a lease deal was worked out to open the track with George Whitney managing the day-to-day of the track. <ref>http://www.norwichbulletin.com/sports/20170606/speedbowl-agreement-reached-to-lease-reopen-track-for-2017-season</ref>.  Whitney operated the track until September of 2018, when he terminated his lease with Bemer with 4 weeks left in the season <ref>http://racedayct.com/2018/09/racing-to-continue-in-2018-at-speedbowl-george-whitney-out-as-operator/</ref>.  Mike Serluca leased the track for the remainder of the 2018 season.\n\nThe track's main grandstand, dating to 1951, was required to be replaced by the town of Waterford and were dismantled after the 2018 season.   New stands are on site but were not erected in time, and the speedway did not open for competition in 2019.  Mike Serluca remains in place as the track's General Manager, and the track anticipates reopening when construction is complete.\n\n[[File:BrianOuimetteHerocardVPback.jpg|thumb|Brian Ouimette at the Waterford Speedbowl.]]\n\n==In media==\n*New York DJ, producer and radio host [[Funkmaster Flex]] wanted to explore his passion for car racing and developed a unique way to get it done with a new [[Spike TV]] show race event called The Funkmaster Flex Super Series Invitational. The race featured 60 hungry late model stock car drivers from across the country turning laps at the Waterford Speedbowl. Flex went behind the scene to see what it takes to become a winner in racing while bringing out celebrities like [[Orange County Choppers]], who paced the field before the start of the race on their choppers, [[Lil' Kim]] who wove the initial green flag as the honorary starter and [[LL Cool J]], who gave a short performance to the crowd after the event.. You can view the YouTube link of the show's opening sequence here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzhrhu2sNlc Monica Taylor Enterprise - Rare Footage of Super Series]  The event was held on Thursday August 5, 2004.  Among those who were invited to qualify for the event included current [[NASCAR]] [[Whelen Modified Tour]] competitors Ted Christopher, Doug Coby and Woody Pitkat.<ref>http://www.techracing.com/NewsPages/2004/tc7-1.htm</ref>  During the late stages of the race, 6-time Speedbowl Late Model Champion Phil Rondeau was called for spinning race leader Ted Christopher with less than 20 laps to go.  3-time Speedbowl LM Champ Allen Coates inherited the lead and held off Woody Pitkat over the final laps to take the win.  Coates won $10,000 and a vintage 1969 Camaro for his victory.  Pitkat took home $6,000 for second and Rondeau $4,000 for third.  The event was billed as having $100,000 in total purse and awards.  The crowd was estimated at around 8,000 people, making it one of the most attended events in the history of the facility.<ref>http://articles.courant.com/2004-08-06/features/0408060755_1_lil-great-race-orange-county-choppers</ref>  Although there were early discussions for this to be a yearly event, Funkmaster Flex never returned to the Speedbowl to continue the series.\n*In the summer of 2005, [[NESN]] debuted a series called \"Inside Line\" that was a reality based show focusing on local racing in the Northeast.<ref>http://www.persistencemedia.com/news/release-inside-line.php</ref> Ted Christopher, one of the premier Modified drivers and former SK Modified Champion at the Speedbowl was one of the people profiled in an early episode of the short-lived series.  Much of the raceday footage used was shot at the Speedbowl on June 25, 2005, when Christopher competed in both the weekly SK Modified 35 lap event and the NASCAR Whelen Modified Tour 150 event.  His twin brother Mike, engine builder Mike Pettit, and fellow competitors Doug Coby, Chris Pasteryak and the late Jay Miller were some of the people who had appearances in the episode as well.\n*The Speedbowl was highlighted on the [[Discovery Channel]] network's show [[Destroyed in Seconds]].<ref>http://www.livedash.com/transcript/destroyed_in_seconds/6222/DSCP/Thursday_January_21_2010/172502/</ref>  Originally airing on February 16, 2009, a segment of the show was dedicated to a wreck during a Late Model event held a few years earlier on Saturday July 8, 2006.  Jay Lozyniak's #28 car barrell-rolled down the front straightaway during a multi-car wreck in turn 4.  Most of the footage shown was recorded by Jay's mother in the stands while it happened.  Jay, and all other drivers involved that night, were not seriously injured.  The race was red-checkered after only 18 of the 30 laps were completed.  Only five cars were able to continue after the incident.  Glenn Colvin, who was the highest positioned car not involved in the wreck, was declared the winner.<ref>http://www.sids-vault.com/stats.php?a=1&b=6&c=7&d=2</ref>\n*The 2011 film 3 Weeks to Daytona, written & directed by [[Fairfield, CT]] native Bret Stern,<ref>http://www.fairfieldcitizenonline.com/news/article/Racer-s-dreams-fuel-inspiration-for-Fairfielder-s-1323625.php</ref>  was shot in several locations throughout the state, including the Waterford Speedbowl. In an interview with the website [[indieWire]], Stern stated \"I was inspired to make the film after watching cars race at the Speedbowl in Waterford, Connecticut. I'd go Saturday night to see races.
