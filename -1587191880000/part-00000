An [[Amateur status in first-class cricket|amateur]], he played as an [[all-rounder]]. As a right-handed batsman, Crawford had a reputation for scoring quickly and hitting powerful shots. He bowled [[Fast bowling#Categorisation of fast bowling|medium-paced]] [[off spin]] and was noted for his accuracy and his ability to make the ball turn sharply from the pitch. Unusually for a first-class cricketer, Crawford wore spectacles while playing.\n\nCrawford established a reputation as an outstanding cricketer while still a schoolboy. He played [[Test cricket]] for [[England cricket team|England]] before he was 21 years old, and successfully toured Australia with the [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] (MCC) in 1907\u201308. He played only 12 matches for England, although critics believed he had a great future in the sport and was a potential future England captain. In two successive English seasons, he completed the [[Double (cricket)|double]] of 1,000 [[Run (cricket)|runs]] and 100 [[Wicket#Dismissing a batsman|wickets]] in first-class games.\n\nA dispute over the composition of a Surrey side chosen to play a high-profile game in 1909, after several professional players were omitted for disciplinary reasons, led to an increasingly bitter argument between Crawford and the Surrey authorities. Crawford was told he had no future with the club, and moved to Australia. There, he worked as a teacher and continued his cricket career with South Australia. This arrangement had a controversial end, when he clashed with the [[South Australian Cricket Association]] over money and moved to New Zealand to play for [[Otago cricket team|Otago]].\n\nThat relationship also ended badly, and he left Otago before being conscripted into the New Zealand armed forces near the end of the First World War. When he was demobilised, he returned to England and made his peace with Surrey. He played a handful of games between 1919 and 1921 but faded out of first-class cricket to pursue a career in industry. In all first-class cricket, Crawford scored 9,488 runs at an [[Batting average (cricket)|average]] of 32.60 and took 815 wickets at an [[Bowling average|average]] of 20.66. Although he continued to play cricket at a lower level, the remainder of Crawford's life passed in relative obscurity.\n\n==Early life and career==\n[[File:ReptonThrotheArch.JPG|upright|left|thumb|[[Repton School]], where Crawford established his reputation as a cricketer|alt=A school viewed through a stone gateway]]\nJack Crawford was born on 1 December 1886 at Cane Hill, [[Coulsdon]], [[Surrey]], the youngest of three sons of the Rev [[John Crawford (cricketer)|John Charles Crawford]] and his wife Alice; the couple also had three daughters.

''Wisden'' reported that Alverstone declined on the grounds that it would suggest a lack of confidence in the committee, but that if Crawford \"came forward in a sportsmanlike way [Alverstone] would be proud to give his personal support to the step proposed.

Even though, according to Burns, it was an \"unwinnable battle\", he suggests simply: \"Young Jack was in the mood for a fight.\"<ref name=Burns>Burns, Chapter 7, Location 1512.</ref>\n\nAt the end of the season, Crawford played his last matches in England for 10 years, appearing for an \"England&nbsp;XI\" against the Australians and for the Gentlemen of the South.<ref name=figures/> He had previously discussed emigrating to Australia with the Australian Test player [[Victor Trumper]], who had asked Clem Hill to investigate a potential teaching post at [[St Peter's College, Adelaide|St Peter's College]], [[Adelaide]].

The SACA described his letter as \"arrogant\" before eventually granting his request and offering him a three-year contract worth around \u00a3300 per year, including coaching fees. In effect, he wanted to double his salary or leave to seek a position in New Zealand. Describing these events, Hart comments: \"Crawford's financial dealings with the SACA reveal him both as mercenary and as an awkward 'cuss'. The latter aspect of his personality needs to be taken into account lest he be considered merely an establishment victim in his parting with Surrey\".<ref name=H29>Hart, p. 29.</ref> On the field, Crawford was successful in 1913\u201314. He took 34 wickets, and against New South Wales he hit 91 in 89 minutes before taking 10 wickets; against Victoria he took eleven wickets.<ref name=H29/> This latter match was his last for South Australia.<ref name=figures/> Later in 1914, Crawford toured New Zealand with an Australian team\u2014assembled without the approval of the Australian Board of Control<ref>Burns, Chapter 9, Location 1705.</ref>\u2014which contained many leading players, under the captaincy of the former [[Canterbury cricket team|Canterbury]] batsman [[Arthur Sims]].<ref name=H30>Hart, pp. 30\u201331.</ref> In first-class games on this tour Crawford took 21 wickets and scored a century, but his most notable innings came in a minor match. Against the \"XV of South Canterbury\", he scored 354 in five-and-a-quarter hours, striking 14 sixes and 45 fours. He and Victor Trumper shared a partnership of 298 in 69 minutes, and [[Monty Noble]] helped him to score 50 runs in 9&nbsp;minutes as the Australian team scored 922 for nine.<ref>Green, ed (1982), p. 381.</ref>\n\nIn March 1914, the [[Otago cricket team|Otago Cricket Association]] (OCA) offered Crawford a three-year contract worth \u00a3350 per year, and a share in the management of a sports store, to play for them. Briefly returning to Adelaide after the tour, he resigned from his South Australia contract before moving to [[Dunedin]] in June 1914.<ref name=H31/> The South Australian Cricket Association were widely criticised for failing to retain Crawford; in their defence, the committee publicly stated that Crawford had been offered an increased deal and had promised to turn down any offers made to him in New Zealand, but went back on his word.<ref>Burns, Chapter 9, Location 1717.</ref> Later historians\u2014Nigel Hart in his biography of Crawford, and Chris Harte in his ''A History of Australian Cricket'' (1993)\u2014condemned Crawford as arrogant and mercenary for his behaviour towards South Australia. Harte also suggests that Crawford left Australia with many debts. Burns, however, suggests that Crawford may have wanted to maximise his earnings to support his upcoming marriage, and notes that his South Australian teammates held no grudges and even organised a farewell presentation.<ref>Burns, Chapter 9, Location 1733.</ref> Once in his new position, Crawford immediately organised a Colts team which produced several future Otago players. While qualifying to play for Otago, he played club cricket in Dunedin, scoring 559 runs and taking 88 wickets.<ref name=H31>Hart, p. 31.</ref> During the 1914\u201315 season he appeared in four first-class games for Otago, in which he scored 337 runs and took 30 wickets.<ref name=figures/> He briefly returned to Australia in 1915 to marry Anita Schmidt in Melbourne in April.<ref>Hart, p. 32.</ref> Schmidt\u2014from Adelaide and described in the [[High society (social class)|society]] press as a \"beauty\"\u2014and Crawford met in 1912 when the former was 18 years old and became well known as a couple at fashionable events in Adelaide.<ref>Burns, Chapter 8, Location 1614.</ref> Burns suggests that the wedding took place in Melbourne rather than Adelaide because Crawford may have been avoiding his creditors. Two days after the wedding, the couple returned to New Zealand.<ref>Burns, Chapter 9, Location 1742.</ref>\n\nCrawford's wages caused the OCA some financial difficulty and were the cause of extended negotiations in 1915. Part of the settlement involved Crawford receiving a lower salary in return for freedom to offer his services to other clubs on a freelance basis. As a consequence, he represented different teams throughout the season in local cricket. He was also paid to coach at [[Otago Boys' High School]]. There were other difficulties; the association complained about the lateness of Crawford's report on the Otago team, and were unhappy that he also coached golf. Crawford in turn told the association that several Otago players were late for practice. After further complaints about Crawford's coaching in 1916, the OCA decided to terminate his contract. Crawford initially offered to continue for less money\u2014\u00a3245. The OCA bargained, suggesting a payment of \u00a3200, whereupon Crawford insisted that he should be paid \u00a3300. The OCA then proposed to terminate his contract immediately for a payment of \u00a3150 but he refused. He was eventually paid \u00a3200 in June to leave Otago.<ref name=H33>Hart, p. 33.</ref> That November, with the [[First World War]] into its third year, New Zealand brought in conscription. Crawford was called up in July 1917,<ref name=H33/> and was posted to a training camp near [[Wellington]] in late 1917.<ref name=H33/> During this time, he played twice for [[Wellington Firebirds|Wellington's cricket team]] in first-class matches during early 1918.<ref name=figures/> When given weekend passes, he visited his wife who was left alone in Dunedin.<ref>Burns, Chapter 9, Location 1797.</ref> He travelled to England prior to a posting to the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]], although he arrived too late to join the fighting. He was part of the [[New Zealand Rifle Brigade (Earl of Liverpool's Own)|New Zealand Rifle Brigade]] but it is unclear what his rank was.<ref name=H33/> The Repton School War Register states that he was a [[rifleman]] but New Zealand press accounts named him as a [[quartermaster sergeant]]. According to a 1992 article in ''[[Wisden Cricket Monthly]]'' by Jim Sullivan, Crawford was demoted while he was in the army. The reasons are unknown, but Burns speculates that his \"independent and obstinate nature\" made it difficult for him to accept military discipline.<ref>Burns, Chapter 9, Location 1822.</ref> While Crawford was in the army, his wife moved to Adelaide.<ref name=H3/><ref name=H34>Hart, p. 34.</ref> According to Anita, the marriage became unhappy in 1916 and Crawford left her in November of that year. She claimed that he had not supported her financially from that point. When the war ended, she returned to live in Australia with her parents. Her subsequent career as a dress designer and fashion buyer necessitated a move to London, where Crawford was living, in 1921 but the couple never reconciled. They were divorced, with some publicity in Australia, in 1923; in court, she gave evidence that he had an affair with a \"third party\". She went on to remarry and to have a successful career as a designer and orchestral conductor.<ref>Burns, Chapter 10, Locations 1935, 1988.</ref>\n\n===Return to England===\nAfter the First World War, Crawford returned to live in England,<ref name=obit/> and was [[Demobilization|demobilised]] from the New Zealand Army in April 1919.<ref>Burns, Chapter 10, Location 1848.</ref> Looking for work, he wrote to Surrey offering to play for them if they found him some employment in turn, but the committee, while writing that they would be pleased if he played for the county again, could not \"see [their] way to find him employment\".<ref name=B10>Burns, Chapter 10, Location 1839.</ref> Crawford may have been contemplating playing professional cricket\u2014unheard of for a former Public School cricketer\u2014but instead found work at Repton, his old school.<ref name=B10/> It is unclear what his position at Repton was at this time; he seems to have had no official cricketing role and it is possible he worked as a teacher simply to maintain his amateur status.<ref name=H34/> In any case, Crawford remained at Repton only until the end of the academic year; his short stay may have been the result of poor results by the cricket team. However, Burns suggests: \"Another indication that the school was not entirely happy to be associated with the Surrey rebel, whose baggage also included an indifferent war record, was that when the Old Boys cricket team, the Repton Pilgrims, was formed in 1921, Crawford was alone among the school's former distinguished players not to be made a member. He was not invited to join the club until 1952.\"<ref>Burns, Chapter 10, Location 1853.</ref>\n\nHaving settled his disagreement with Surrey, Crawford resumed his English first-class cricket career in 1919.<ref name=obit/> After appearing for the Gentlemen against the Players, Crawford returned to play for Surrey against the [[Australian Imperial Forces cricket team|Australian Imperial Forces]]. He scored 144 not out, which was later described by ''Wisden'' as the innings of his life.<ref name=obit/><ref name=figures/> Surrey were 26 for five in reply to the tourists' innings of 436 when Crawford came in to bat. [[Neville Cardus]] reported: \"[Crawford] fell upon the advancing Australian attack, and by driving seldom equalled, threw it back.\"<ref name=figures/><ref name=G153>Green (1988), p. 153.</ref> He more than doubled his score after the ninth wicket had fallen, hitting 73 out of the last 80 runs scored in 35 minutes to take Surrey past the target required to avoid the [[follow-on]].<ref name=G153/> Among his other successes, he scored 92 against Yorkshire. Playing against Kent, he hit 48 not out as [[Jack Hobbs]] and he scored 96 in 32 minutes; this partnership took Surrey to victory as they chased an apparently impossible chase in the short time remaining in the match.<ref name=figures/><ref>Green, ed (1982), p. 751.</ref>\n\nIn total, Crawford played in eight games in 1919, scoring 488 runs and taking 20 wickets.<ref name=fcbatting/><ref name=fcbowling/> ''Wisden'' commented that his batting was as good as it had ever been, but his bowling lacked spin and accuracy.<ref name=H34/> He played only four more times in first-class cricket.<ref name=figures/> Part of the explanation was that he joined [[Dunlop Rubber]] as a manager at one of its mills in [[Rochdale]].

An [[Amateur status in first-class cricket|amateur]], he played as an [[all-rounder]]. As a right-handed batsman, Crawford had a reputation for scoring quickly and hitting powerful shots. He bowled [[Fast bowling#Categorisation of fast bowling|medium-paced]] [[off spin]] and was noted for his accuracy and his ability to make the ball turn sharply from the pitch. Unusually for a first-class cricketer, Crawford wore spectacles while playing.\n\nCrawford established a reputation as an outstanding cricketer while still a schoolboy. He played [[Test cricket]] for [[England cricket team|England]] before he was 21 years old, and successfully toured Australia with the [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] (MCC) in 1907\u201308. He played only 12 matches for England, although critics believed he had a great future in the sport and was a potential future England captain. In two successive English seasons, he completed the [[Double (cricket)|double]] of 1,000 [[Run (cricket)|runs]] and 100 [[Wicket#Dismissing a batsman|wickets]] in first-class games.\n\nA dispute over the composition of a Surrey side chosen to play a high-profile game in 1909, after several professional players were omitted for disciplinary reasons, led to an increasingly bitter argument between Crawford and the Surrey authorities. Crawford was told he had no future with the club, and moved to Australia. There, he worked as a teacher and continued his cricket career with South Australia. This arrangement had a controversial end, when he clashed with the [[South Australian Cricket Association]] over money and moved to New Zealand to play for [[Otago cricket team|Otago]].\n\nThat relationship also ended badly, and he left Otago before being conscripted into the New Zealand armed forces near the end of the First World War. When he was demobilised, he returned to England and made his peace with Surrey. He played a handful of games between 1919 and 1921 but faded out of first-class cricket to pursue a career in industry. In all first-class cricket, Crawford scored 9,488 runs at an [[Batting average (cricket)|average]] of 32.60 and took 815 wickets at an [[Bowling average|average]] of 20.66. Although he continued to play cricket at a lower level, the remainder of Crawford's life passed in relative obscurity.\n\n==Early life and career==\n[[File:ReptonThrotheArch.JPG|upright|left|thumb|[[Repton School]], where Crawford established his reputation as a cricketer|alt=A school viewed through a stone gateway]]\nJack Crawford was born on 1 December 1886 at Cane Hill, [[Coulsdon]], [[Surrey]], the youngest of three sons of the Rev [[John Crawford (cricketer)|John Charles Crawford]] and his wife Alice; the couple also had three daughters.

Crawford also missed the beginning of the season; a newspaper article by [[Albert Trott]], a former Australian Test all-rounder now playing for Middlesex, suggested that Crawford withdrew from the team because he was not appointed captain in Leveson Gower's absence. Instead [[Harry Bush (English cricketer)|Harry Bush]], who had not played first-class cricket for five years, led the team. Trott was sympathetic to Crawford, stating that the Surrey committee went out of their way \"to inflict a most undeserved slight\" on Crawford.{{refn|Burns suggests that this was the actual reason for Crawford's absence because his father, who kept a scrapbook of newspaper clippings throughout his son's career, kept Trott's article.<ref>Burns, Chapter 7, Location 1270.</ref>|group=notes}}<ref>Burns, Chapter 7, Location 1258.</ref>\n\nIn the remainder of the season, Crawford scored 232 against [[Somerset County Cricket Club|Somerset]], his highest first-class score, as well as centuries against Derbyshire and [[Hampshire County Cricket Club|Hampshire]].<ref name=figures/> The increased strength and variety of Surrey's bowling attack restricted his opportunities; he was used less as a strike bowler and bowled fewer overs than in the previous season.<ref>Hart, p. 17.</ref> Contemporary reports suggested that his performances tailed off as the season progressed, possibly through tiredness from having played too much cricket, and that he became a less accurate bowler through trying too hard to spin the ball.<ref name=H17>Hart, pp. 17\u201318.</ref> The Surrey captaincy remained unsettled; Crawford led the team on several occasions, including Surrey's final game of the season, when his brother Vivian captained Leicestershire, their opponents.<ref name=H17/><ref>{{Cite web| url = https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/7/7740.html| title = Surrey v Leicestershire in 1908| publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate = 21 May 2011}}</ref>\n\nCrawford, who played as an amateur but was not independently wealthy, received an increased expenses allowance during 1908, but other financial dealings with the committee were less successful: they paid his laundry bills in 1905, but refused to do so afterwards; additionally, they refused his request in 1907 to have part of his expenses paid for matches that he missed, as happened with the wages of professionals.<ref>Burns, Chapter 7, Location 1286.</ref> His financial problems were compounded by his inability to find a suitable job, and the Surrey committee threatened that he \"ought not to be played on the same terms\" unless he \"[commenced] to earn his livelihood\".<ref>Burns, Chapter 7, Location 1305.</ref>\n\nCrawford's performances in the 1909 season were less effective than in previous years.<ref name=fcbatting/><ref name=fcbowling/> He began well, but was later hampered by an injury which prevented him from bowling.<ref name=H21>Hart, p. 21.</ref> His batting average also fell.<ref name=fcbatting/> Surrey experienced disciplinary problems with several of their professional players during the season.<ref name=G222/> The club president, [[Richard Webster, 1st Viscount Alverstone|Lord Alverstone]], favoured amateurs, arguing that a losing amateur team was preferable to a professional side that won; several professionals were left out in favour of amateurs.<ref name=mck97>McKinstry, p. 97.</ref> Apart from adversely affecting some players' careers, this preference had destabilised the team over several seasons.<ref>McKinstry, p. 48.</ref> Crawford disagreed with Alverstone, but nevertheless frequently assumed the leadership in the absence of the regular captain Leveson Gower for much of the season.<ref name=mck97/> He captained Surrey to a win over the touring Australian team early in 1909 after a strong performance by the professional bowler [[Tom Rushby]].<ref name=G148/> However, his captaincy was strongly criticised in the press, particularly over his management of the bowling.<ref>Burns, Chapter 7, Location 1328.</ref> Around this time, Crawford's form declined. With the bat, he was often dismissed attempting aggressive shots, and he lost his effectiveness as a bowler. As a result, he was not chosen for the Gentlemen and missed selection in the Ashes series. The press continued to criticise his captaincy, despite Surrey's good results under his leadership.

''Wisden'' reported that Alverstone declined on the grounds that it would suggest a lack of confidence in the committee, but that if Crawford \"came forward in a sportsmanlike way [Alverstone] would be proud to give his personal support to the step proposed. This of course meant that an apology was expected.\"<ref name=G224>Green, ed (1982), p. 224.</ref>\n\nIn his ''History of Cricket'', Green contended that the \"Surrey committee must be held accountable for a degree of idiocy rarely met with even in the realms of cricket administration\" for the way they dealt with Crawford, \"one of the world's most prodigious all-rounders.\"<ref name=G224/> Hart observes that Crawford was challenging figures high up in the cricket establishment on the Surrey committee;<ref name=H17/> he also suggests that Crawford's actions in his later career, and the complaints made against him by other cricket authorities, reveal a stubbornness in his character and suggest he was not merely a victim of the Surrey committee.<ref name=H29/> ''The Times'' speculated that factors other than the dispute may have contributed to Surrey's decision.<ref name=times/> Burns believes that Crawford was feeling pressure from several directions: his inability to secure a job, possible frustration at the controlling influence of his father, a desire to be independent, his poor run of form and criticism of his captaincy. Even though, according to Burns, it was an \"unwinnable battle\", he suggests simply: \"Young Jack was in the mood for a fight.\"<ref name=Burns>Burns, Chapter 7, Location 1512.</ref>\n\nAt the end of the season, Crawford played his last matches in England for 10 years, appearing for an \"England&nbsp;XI\" against the Australians and for the Gentlemen of the South.<ref name=figures/> He had previously discussed emigrating to Australia with the Australian Test player [[Victor Trumper]], who had asked Clem Hill to investigate a potential teaching post at [[St Peter's College, Adelaide|St Peter's College]], [[Adelaide]]. Originally, assuming that he would be part of the MCC tour to South Africa, he planned to take up his position in March 1910. When the dispute arose, Crawford sent a telegram to inform the college he would take up the post of \"Resident Master\" early in 1910, for a salary of \u00a3160 per year.<ref name=H17/><ref>Burns, Chapter 7, Location 1525.</ref> Burns suggests that this knowledge that he had the offer of work may have prompted him to take a stand against the Surrey committee.<ref name=Burns/> In October 1910 he was offered the position of \"Ordinary Master\" at the college, and \u00a350 towards his travel expenses if he departed immediately.

The latter aspect of his personality needs to be taken into account lest he be considered merely an establishment victim in his parting with Surrey\".<ref name=H29>Hart, p. 29.</ref> On the field, Crawford was successful in 1913\u201314. He took 34 wickets, and against New South Wales he hit 91 in 89 minutes before taking 10 wickets; against Victoria he took eleven wickets.<ref name=H29/> This latter match was his last for South Australia.<ref name=figures/> Later in 1914, Crawford toured New Zealand with an Australian team\u2014assembled without the approval of the Australian Board of Control<ref>Burns, Chapter 9, Location 1705.</ref>\u2014which contained many leading players, under the captaincy of the former [[Canterbury cricket team|Canterbury]] batsman [[Arthur Sims]].<ref name=H30>Hart, pp. 30\u201331.</ref> In first-class games on this tour Crawford took 21 wickets and scored a century, but his most notable innings came in a minor match. Against the \"XV of South Canterbury\", he scored 354 in five-and-a-quarter hours, striking 14 sixes and 45 fours. He and Victor Trumper shared a partnership of 298 in 69 minutes, and [[Monty Noble]] helped him to score 50 runs in 9&nbsp;minutes as the Australian team scored 922 for nine.<ref>Green, ed (1982), p. 381.</ref>\n\nIn March 1914, the [[Otago cricket team|Otago Cricket Association]] (OCA) offered Crawford a three-year contract worth \u00a3350 per year, and a share in the management of a sports store, to play for them. Briefly returning to Adelaide after the tour, he resigned from his South Australia contract before moving to [[Dunedin]] in June 1914.<ref name=H31/> The South Australian Cricket Association were widely criticised for failing to retain Crawford; in their defence, the committee publicly stated that Crawford had been offered an increased deal and had promised to turn down any offers made to him in New Zealand, but went back on his word.<ref>Burns, Chapter 9, Location 1717.</ref> Later historians\u2014Nigel Hart in his biography of Crawford, and Chris Harte in his ''A History of Australian Cricket'' (1993)\u2014condemned Crawford as arrogant and mercenary for his behaviour towards South Australia. Harte also suggests that Crawford left Australia with many debts. Burns, however, suggests that Crawford may have wanted to maximise his earnings to support his upcoming marriage, and notes that his South Australian teammates held no grudges and even organised a farewell presentation.<ref>Burns, Chapter 9, Location 1733.</ref> Once in his new position, Crawford immediately organised a Colts team which produced several future Otago players. While qualifying to play for Otago, he played club cricket in Dunedin, scoring 559 runs and taking 88 wickets.<ref name=H31>Hart, p. 31.</ref> During the 1914\u201315 season he appeared in four first-class games for Otago, in which he scored 337 runs and took 30 wickets.<ref name=figures/> He briefly returned to Australia in 1915 to marry Anita Schmidt in Melbourne in April.<ref>Hart, p. 32.</ref> Schmidt\u2014from Adelaide and described in the [[High society (social class)|society]] press as a \"beauty\"\u2014and Crawford met in 1912 when the former was 18 years old and became well known as a couple at fashionable events in Adelaide.<ref>Burns, Chapter 8, Location 1614.</ref> Burns suggests that the wedding took place in Melbourne rather than Adelaide because Crawford may have been avoiding his creditors. Two days after the wedding, the couple returned to New Zealand.<ref>Burns, Chapter 9, Location 1742.</ref>\n\nCrawford's wages caused the OCA some financial difficulty and were the cause of extended negotiations in 1915. Part of the settlement involved Crawford receiving a lower salary in return for freedom to offer his services to other clubs on a freelance basis. As a consequence, he represented different teams throughout the season in local cricket. He was also paid to coach at [[Otago Boys' High School]]. There were other difficulties; the association complained about the lateness of Crawford's report on the Otago team, and were unhappy that he also coached golf. Crawford in turn told the association that several Otago players were late for practice. After further complaints about Crawford's coaching in 1916, the OCA decided to terminate his contract. Crawford initially offered to continue for less money\u2014\u00a3245. The OCA bargained, suggesting a payment of \u00a3200, whereupon Crawford insisted that he should be paid \u00a3300. The OCA then proposed to terminate his contract immediately for a payment of \u00a3150 but he refused. He was eventually paid \u00a3200 in June to leave Otago.<ref name=H33>Hart, p. 33.</ref> That November, with the [[First World War]] into its third year, New Zealand brought in conscription. Crawford was called up in July 1917,<ref name=H33/> and was posted to a training camp near [[Wellington]] in late 1917.<ref name=H33/> During this time, he played twice for [[Wellington Firebirds|Wellington's cricket team]] in first-class matches during early 1918.<ref name=figures/> When given weekend passes, he visited his wife who was left alone in Dunedin.<ref>Burns, Chapter 9, Location 1797.</ref> He travelled to England prior to a posting to the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]], although he arrived too late to join the fighting. He was part of the [[New Zealand Rifle Brigade (Earl of Liverpool's Own)|New Zealand Rifle Brigade]] but it is unclear what his rank was.<ref name=H33/> The Repton School War Register states that he was a [[rifleman]] but New Zealand press accounts named him as a [[quartermaster sergeant]]. According to a 1992 article in ''[[Wisden Cricket Monthly]]'' by Jim Sullivan, Crawford was demoted while he was in the army. The reasons are unknown, but Burns speculates that his \"independent and obstinate nature\" made it difficult for him to accept military discipline.<ref>Burns, Chapter 9, Location 1822.</ref> While Crawford was in the army, his wife moved to Adelaide.<ref name=H3/><ref name=H34>Hart, p. 34.</ref> According to Anita, the marriage became unhappy in 1916 and Crawford left her in November of that year. She claimed that he had not supported her financially from that point. When the war ended, she returned to live in Australia with her parents. Her subsequent career as a dress designer and fashion buyer necessitated a move to London, where Crawford was living, in 1921 but the couple never reconciled. They were divorced, with some publicity in Australia, in 1923; in court, she gave evidence that he had an affair with a \"third party\". She went on to remarry and to have a successful career as a designer and orchestral conductor.<ref>Burns, Chapter 10, Locations 1935, 1988.</ref>\n\n===Return to England===\nAfter the First World War, Crawford returned to live in England,<ref name=obit/> and was [[Demobilization|demobilised]] from the New Zealand Army in April 1919.<ref>Burns, Chapter 10, Location 1848.</ref> Looking for work, he wrote to Surrey offering to play for them if they found him some employment in turn, but the committee, while writing that they would be pleased if he played for the county again, could not \"see [their] way to find him employment\".<ref name=B10>Burns, Chapter 10, Location 1839.</ref> Crawford may have been contemplating playing professional cricket\u2014unheard of for a former Public School cricketer\u2014but instead found work at Repton, his old school.<ref name=B10/> It is unclear what his position at Repton was at this time; he seems to have had no official cricketing role and it is possible he worked as a teacher simply to maintain his amateur status.<ref name=H34/> In any case, Crawford remained at Repton only until the end of the academic year; his short stay may have been the result of poor results by the cricket team. However, Burns suggests: \"Another indication that the school was not entirely happy to be associated with the Surrey rebel, whose baggage also included an indifferent war record, was that when the Old Boys cricket team, the Repton Pilgrims, was formed in 1921, Crawford was alone among the school's former distinguished players not to be made a member. He was not invited to join the club until 1952.\"<ref>Burns, Chapter 10, Location 1853.</ref>\n\nHaving settled his disagreement with Surrey, Crawford resumed his English first-class cricket career in 1919.<ref name=obit/> After appearing for the Gentlemen against the Players, Crawford returned to play for Surrey against the [[Australian Imperial Forces cricket team|Australian Imperial Forces]]. He scored 144 not out, which was later described by ''Wisden'' as the innings of his life.<ref name=obit/><ref name=figures/> Surrey were 26 for five in reply to the tourists' innings of 436 when Crawford came in to bat. [[Neville Cardus]] reported: \"[Crawford] fell upon the advancing Australian attack, and by driving seldom equalled, threw it back.\"<ref name=figures/><ref name=G153>Green (1988), p. 153.</ref> He more than doubled his score after the ninth wicket had fallen, hitting 73 out of the last 80 runs scored in 35 minutes to take Surrey past the target required to avoid the [[follow-on]].<ref name=G153/> Among his other successes, he scored 92 against Yorkshire. Playing against Kent, he hit 48 not out as [[Jack Hobbs]] and he scored 96 in 32 minutes; this partnership took Surrey to victory as they chased an apparently impossible chase in the short time remaining in the match.<ref name=figures/><ref>Green, ed (1982), p. 751.</ref>\n\nIn total, Crawford played in eight games in 1919, scoring 488 runs and taking 20 wickets.<ref name=fcbatting/><ref name=fcbowling/> ''Wisden'' commented that his batting was as good as it had ever been, but his bowling lacked spin and accuracy.<ref name=H34/> He played only four more times in first-class cricket.<ref name=figures/> Part of the explanation was that he joined [[Dunlop Rubber]] as a manager at one of its mills in [[Rochdale]]. He played as an amateur for [[Rochdale Cricket Club]] in 1920,<ref name=H36>Hart, p. 36.</ref> but by 1921 he had left the club\u2014the ''Manchester Guardian'' speculated that he had returned to Surrey.<ref>Burns, Chapter 10, Location 1932.</ref> He returned to live with his family in Merton Park, and played for the local cricket club.<ref>Burns, Chapter 10, Location 1940.</ref> Of his first-class matches, one was for Surrey against the Australian touring team of 1921 and the others were for teams representing the Gentlemen.<ref name=figures/> In his entire first-class career, Crawford scored 9,488 runs at an average of 32.60 and took 815 wickets at 20.66.<ref name=cricinfo/>\n\nFrom the mid-1920s until his retirement in 1952, Crawford worked for the importers [[Fyffes|Elders and Fyffes]]. He played cricket and hockey for the firm until the Second World War, but kept a far lower profile than in his earlier cricketing life.<ref name=H3>Hart, p. 3.</ref> He married his second wife, Hilda May Beman, in December 1925, but he never had children.<ref>Burns, Chapter 10, Location 2003.</ref><ref name=H3/> He maintained a loose connection with cricket; he appeared at a birthday dinner for [[Pelham Warner]], at a centenary celebration for the [[Free Foresters Cricket Club]] and in a radio broadcast for Jack Hobbs's 80th birthday.<ref name=H3/> Crawford had a stroke in early 1962 and remained ill for the rest of the year;<ref>Burns, Epilogue, Location 2054.</ref> he died, aged 76, in a Surrey hospital on 2&nbsp;May 1963.<ref name=times/><ref name=obit/>\n\n==Style and technique==\n[[File:Crawford bowling 2.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Crawford demonstrating his bowling action in 1906]]\nCrawford's obituary in ''The Times'' described him as one of the best young players to play cricket in England and said: \"Although he invariably played in glasses, he was a most attractive player to watch, an aggressive hitter of the ball and a dangerous medium-paced bowler\".<ref name=times/> ''Wisden'' described him as a \"hard-hitting batsman\",<ref name=obit/> and said he played mainly from the [[Glossary of cricket terms#F|front foot]].<ref name=coy/> He had an orthodox batting technique, moved his feet well to get to the ball,<ref name=S167/> and played very straight.<ref name=coy/> [[Herbie Collins]], who played with Crawford in Australia, described one of his innings as \"a hurricane innings, full of classical shots charged with dynamite.\"<ref name=Collins>{{Cite news| last = Collins | first = H.

The forces were formed upon the secession of Katanga from the [[Republic of the Congo]] with help from [[Belgian army|Belgian soldiers]] and former officers of the ''[[Force Publique]]''. Belgian troops also provided much of the early training for the Gendarmerie, which was mainly composed of Katangese but largely led by Belgians and later European mercenaries. \n\nThroughout the existence of the State of Katanga, the gendarmes sporadically fought various tribes and the [[Arm\u00e9e Nationale Congolaise]] (ANC). In February 1961 the Gendarmerie initiated a series of operations aimed at suppressing anti-secessionist rebels of the [[Association G\u00e9n\u00e9rale des Baluba du Katanga]] (BALUBAKAT) in North Katanga. The campaign was largely successful, but the fighting led to atrocities and gendarmes were halted by forces of the [[United Nations Operation in the Congo]] (ONUC) during the [[Battle of Kabalo]] in April 1961. ONUC then initiated efforts to remove foreign mercenaries from the Gendarmerie, and launched [[Operation Rum Punch]] to arrest them in August 1961. They came into conflict with ONUC three times after, in [[Operation Morthor]] (September 1961), [[Operation UNOKAT]] (December 1961), and [[Operation Grandslam]] (December 1962). Operation Grandslam marked the end of the Katangese secession in January 1963. \n\nAfter the secession, many gendarmes returned to a civilian live or were integrated with the ANC. However, around 8,000 refused to, and many kept their arms and roamed  [[North Rhodesia]], Angola and Katanga. Many crossed the Congo border into Angola, where Portuguese colonial authorities assisted and trained them. They were involved in several mutinies and attempted invasions of the Congo, most notably the [[Stanleyville mutinies]] in 1966 and 1967. \n\nAfter 1967, around 2,500 gendarmes were present in Angola, where they were reorganized as the [[Congolese National Liberation Front]] (FLNC) and fought in the [[Angolan War of Independence]] on the side of the Portuguese government against the [[Movimento Popular de Liberta\u00e7\u00e3o de Angola]] (MPLA) and [[Uni\u00e3o Nacional para a Independ\u00eancia Total de Angola]] (UNITA). When the war ended in 1975, they fought in the [[Angolan Civil War]] against the [[National Liberation Front of Angola]] (FNLA).  The FLNC was involved in [[Shaba I]] and [[Shaba II|II]], attempted invasions of Katanga. Split into factions after the war, the [[Katangese Tigers|Tigres]] emerged and played a decisive role in the [[First Congo War]]. There has since been little gendarme presence, but they have emerged as a symbol of secessionist thinking\n\n== Origins ==\n\n=== Background ===\n{{Main|Congo Crisis}}\n[[File:Kongo_1961_map_en.png|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Kongo_1961_map_en.png|left|thumb|Map of the Congo with the State of Katanga in green]]\nThe [[Belgian Congo]] was established from the [[Congo Free State]] in 1908.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wdl.org/en/item/11900/|title=Belgian Congo|last=|first=|date=1920|website=World Digital Library|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref> [[Belgium]] held control of the colony until it gained independence as the [[Republic of the Congo (L\u00e9opoldville)|Republic of the Congo]] on June 30, 1960.

At the same time the United Nations attempted to suppress foreign support to the Gendarmerie; 338 mercenaries and 443 political advisers were expelled from the region by August.

UMHK officials privately told Tshombe they were withdrawing their support for succession.<ref name=\"othen\" /> Muk\u00e9 vainly attempted to organise the 140 mercenaries and 2,000 gendarmes under his command to prepare a final defence of Kolwezi. His efforts, undermined by the force's low morale and indiscipline, were further hampered by an influx of refugees. Tshombe ordered the Katangese garrison of [[Baudouinville]] to surrender to besieging UN and ANC forces. Instead, they and most of the population deserted the city while a handful of gendarmes near [[Kongolo, Katanga|Kongolo]] laid down their arms to Nigerian and Malaysian soldiers. On 14 January, Indian troops found the last intact bridge into Kolwezi. After a brief fight with gendarmes and mercenaries they secured it and crossed over, stopping at the city outskirts to await further instruction.<ref name=\"othen\" /> At a final meeting with his mercenary commanders, Tshombe ordered all remaining Katangese armed forces to withdraw to Portuguese Angola. Mercenary [[Jean Schramme]] was appointed to be commander of an army in exile, while mercenary Jeremiah Puren was ordered to evacuate what remained of the Katangese Air Force, along with necessary military equipment and the Katangese treasury. This was accomplished via air and railway. Rhodesian operatives assisted in smuggling the gold reserves out of the country. The last of Schramme's mercenaries and gendarmes were evacuated on 25 January.<ref name=\"othen\" />\n\nOn 15 January, Tshombe sent a formal message to Thant, \"I am ready to proclaim immediately before the world that the Katanga's secession is ended.\"{{sfn|Meisler|2011|p=133}} He offered to return to \u00c9lisabethville to oversee the implementation of Thant's proposal for reunification if Prime Minister Adoula granted amnesty to himself and his government. At a press conference, Adoula accepted Tshombe's proposition and announced that what remained of the Katangese Gendarmerie would be integrated into the ANC.{{sfn|O'Ballance|1999|p=63}} Total statistics on Katangese Gendarmerie and mercenary casualties from Operation Grandslam are unknown. Following the operation the UN was able to confirm that Portuguese Angola, South Africa, and Northern Rhodesia had assisted the Katangese in arming their air force.{{sfn|Dorn|2016|p=32}}\n\n=== Exile, return, and the Simba rebellion ===\n{{Further|Simba rebellion}}\nAfter the defeat of the State of Katanga, plans to disarm or integrate the gendarmes were made. On 8 February 1963, General Muk\u00e9 and several of his officers pledged their allegiance to President Kasa-Vubu.{{sfn|O'Ballance|1999|p=63}} However, of the estimated 14,000\u201317,000 gendarmes, only 3,500 registered for integration, and only around 2,000\u20133,000 became part of the ANC. Those who integrated suffered threats and violence, and were given lower ranks. An estimated 7,000 returned to civilian life, and a further 8,000 escaped disarmament. Of the 8,000, some found work in security, and thousands of others were reported to be roaming \"in the bush in South Katanga\". Many could not return to their homes, and were considered outcasts. Further United Nations efforts at reconciliation were ended as the United Nations focused on withdrawing its own forces from the region in December 1963. The ANC began raiding pro-secession communities, as gendarmes continued to roam North Rhodesia, Angola and Katanga.{{sfn|Kennes|Larmer|2016|pp=64\u201365}}\n\nThroughout 1963 gendarmes steadily crossed into Angola. Portuguese colonial authorities, eager to assist the anticommunist Katangese, organised them in \"refugee\" camps. By 1964, two of the four camps had become dedicated training facilities. Mercenaries traveled from Katanga to Angola via Rhodesia to relay messages between Tshombe, the gendarmes, and the mercenaries, with logistical support from [[Southern Rhodesia]].{{sfn|Kennes|Larmer|2016|p=67}} Around April, Tshombe appeared to have remobilised his forces.{{sfn|Kennes|Larmer|2016|p=68}} Immediately after becoming Prime Minister in July, he ordered the exiled Katangese to return to the Congo and mobilised some of those that had been in hiding so that they could suppress the [[Kwilu rebellion|Kwilu]] and [[Simba rebellion|Simba rebels]].{{sfn|Kennes|Larmer|2016|p=69}} They were used successfully against both insurgencies, and, following Tshombe's ousting from power, they retained significant political distance from Mobutu's regime. Relations between the two parties quickly worsened, culminating in [[Stanleyville mutinies|a bloody mutiny]] in July 1966.{{sfn|Kennes|Larmer|2016|p=75}}\n\nA March 1967 trial of Tshombe ''[[Trial in absentia|in absentia]]'' criminalized the actions of the gendarmes retrospectively. After the trial, the gendarmes were referred to as 'mercenaries' by Congolese press. A [[Stanleyville mutinies#Second mutiny|second wave of mutinies]] broke out on July 5, 1967 in [[Bukavu]] and [[Kisangani]], after Tshombe's plane was hijacked and he was detained in [[Algiers]]. The mutinies were led by European mercenaries. An estimated 600 former gendarmes, led by Belgian mercenary [[Jean Schramme]] were present in Kisangani during the mutiny. Under pressure from the ANC, Schramme was forced to evacuate the city with 300 mercenaries and a few thousand gendarmes. They reached Bukavu, and a secessionist state was declared.{{sfn|Kennes|Larmer|2016|pp=77\u201378}}<ref>{{Cite news|last=Tanner|first=Henry|url=|title=Congo: The Revolt That Failed|date=July 23, 1967|work=The New York Times|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref> A plan was proposed by the [[International Red Cross]] to evacuate 950 gendarmes and around 650 of their dependents to [[Zambia]]. Schramme and Mobutu objected, and the plan did not go forward. Tough the ANC continued fighting, around 900 gendarmes gave up their arms and crossed into Rwanda. At the end of the mutinies, the gendarmes agreed to a cease-fire proposed by [[Diallo Telli]] under which they could gain amnesty by returning to the Congo. The mercenaries were expelled from Africa and returned to Europe.{{sfn|Kennes|Larmer|2016|pp=77\u201378}}{{Sfn|Arnold|1999|p=15}}\n\nA brief rebellion was executed by [[Bob Denard]] from November 1 to 5, 1967.

The forces were formed upon the secession of Katanga from the [[Republic of the Congo]] with help from [[Belgian army|Belgian soldiers]] and former officers of the ''[[Force Publique]]''. Belgian troops also provided much of the early training for the Gendarmerie, which was mainly composed of Katangese but largely led by Belgians and later European mercenaries. \n\nThroughout the existence of the State of Katanga, the gendarmes sporadically fought various tribes and the [[Arm\u00e9e Nationale Congolaise]] (ANC). In February 1961 the Gendarmerie initiated a series of operations aimed at suppressing anti-secessionist rebels of the [[Association G\u00e9n\u00e9rale des Baluba du Katanga]] (BALUBAKAT) in North Katanga. The campaign was largely successful, but the fighting led to atrocities and gendarmes were halted by forces of the [[United Nations Operation in the Congo]] (ONUC) during the [[Battle of Kabalo]] in April 1961. ONUC then initiated efforts to remove foreign mercenaries from the Gendarmerie, and launched [[Operation Rum Punch]] to arrest them in August 1961. They came into conflict with ONUC three times after, in [[Operation Morthor]] (September 1961), [[Operation UNOKAT]] (December 1961), and [[Operation Grandslam]] (December 1962). Operation Grandslam marked the end of the Katangese secession in January 1963. \n\nAfter the secession, many gendarmes returned to a civilian live or were integrated with the ANC. However, around 8,000 refused to, and many kept their arms and roamed  [[North Rhodesia]], Angola and Katanga. Many crossed the Congo border into Angola, where Portuguese colonial authorities assisted and trained them. They were involved in several mutinies and attempted invasions of the Congo, most notably the [[Stanleyville mutinies]] in 1966 and 1967. \n\nAfter 1967, around 2,500 gendarmes were present in Angola, where they were reorganized as the [[Congolese National Liberation Front]] (FLNC) and fought in the [[Angolan War of Independence]] on the side of the Portuguese government against the [[Movimento Popular de Liberta\u00e7\u00e3o de Angola]] (MPLA) and [[Uni\u00e3o Nacional para a Independ\u00eancia Total de Angola]] (UNITA). When the war ended in 1975, they fought in the [[Angolan Civil War]] against the [[National Liberation Front of Angola]] (FNLA).  The FLNC was involved in [[Shaba I]] and [[Shaba II|II]], attempted invasions of Katanga. Split into factions after the war, the [[Katangese Tigers|Tigres]] emerged and played a decisive role in the [[First Congo War]]. There has since been little gendarme presence, but they have emerged as a symbol of secessionist thinking\n\n== Origins ==\n\n=== Background ===\n{{Main|Congo Crisis}}\n[[File:Kongo_1961_map_en.png|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Kongo_1961_map_en.png|left|thumb|Map of the Congo with the State of Katanga in green]]\nThe [[Belgian Congo]] was established from the [[Congo Free State]] in 1908.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wdl.org/en/item/11900/|title=Belgian Congo|last=|first=|date=1920|website=World Digital Library|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref> [[Belgium]] held control of the colony until it gained independence as the [[Republic of the Congo (L\u00e9opoldville)|Republic of the Congo]] on June 30, 1960.

Between 50 and 100 [[mercenaries]] of various nationalities were initially present,{{sfn|Hoskyns|1965|p=384}} but over the course of 1961 the Katangese government increased recruitment efforts.

Approximately 5,000 troops were earmarked for the operation, which focused on a northward offensive from Lubudi. At the same time, they were to recapture the town of [[Manono, Democratic Republic of the Congo|Manono]], secure the area south of it, and launch attacks on [[Kabalo]] from [[Kalemie|Albertville]] to the east and [[Kongolo, Tanganyika|Kongolo]] to the north.{{sfn|Lefever|Joshua|1966|p=P-16}} The Katangese Gendarmerie subsequently launched operations Banquise, Mambo, and Lotus against the BALUBAKAT rebels.{{sfn|Kennes|Larmer|2016|pp=47\u201349}} In March the army seized Manono.{{sfn|Lefever|Joshua|1966|p=P-16}}\n\nThe Gendarmerie then shifted their focus to Kabalo, where they chiefly intended to secure the railway.{{sfn|Higgins|1980|p=417}} The town was garrisoned by two companies of an Ethiopian battalion serving with ONUC.{{sfn|Lefever|Joshua|1966|p=P-16}}{{sfn|Puren|Pottinger|1986|p=30}} On 7 April a Katangese plane carrying 30 mercenaries landed to secure the airstrip in the town but they were promptly arrested by the ONUC troops.{{sfn|Puren|Pottinger|1986|p=30}} Katangese forces moving by land attacked ONUC soldiers and fought with BALUBAKAT partisans.

Despite these interactions, the Belgian government gradually adopted a strategy of privately pressuring the Katangese to accept reintegration. Such efforts largely failed.{{sfn|Kennes|Larmer|2016|p=50}}\n\nAfter being pressured by the United States and United Nations, Belgium removed many of its forces from the region from August to September 1961. However, many officers remained, without official Belgian support, or became mercenaries. To support these efforts, Belgium organized hundreds of Europeans to fight with Katanga. At the same time the United Nations attempted to suppress foreign support to the Gendarmerie; 338 mercenaries and 443 political advisers were expelled from the region by August. That same month, war veterans were first [[Military awards and decorations|honored]]. Dead soldiers were also remembered in ceremonies at the [[Sts.

Those who integrated suffered threats and violence, and were given lower ranks. An estimated 7,000 returned to civilian life, and a further 8,000 escaped disarmament. Of the 8,000, some found work in security, and thousands of others were reported to be roaming \"in the bush in South Katanga\". Many could not return to their homes, and were considered outcasts. Further United Nations efforts at reconciliation were ended as the United Nations focused on withdrawing its own forces from the region in December 1963.

In Two Volumes. Volume II M-Z]</ref> During the time of the [[Mauryan Empire]] in the 3rd century BCE, overland trade between India and several parts of [[Western Asia]] and [[Bactria]] world went through the cities of the north-west, primarily [[Taxila (ancient)|Takshashila]] and [[Purushapura]] modern-day [[Peshawar]] (in present-day in [[Pakistan]]). Takshashila was well connected by roads with other parts of the Mauryan Empire. The Mauryas had maintained this very ancient highway from Takshashila to [[Patliputra]] (present-day [[Patna]] in India). Chandragupta Maurya had a whole army of officials overseeing the maintenance of this road as told by the Greek diplomat [[Megasthenes]] who spent fifteen years at the Mauryan court. Constructed in eight stages, this road is said to have connected the cities of [[Peshawar|Purushapura]], [[Taxila|Takshashila]], [[Hastinapur]]a, [[Kannauj|Kanyakubja]], [[Allahabad|Prayag]], [[Patliputra]] and [[Tamralipta]], a distance of around {{convert|2600|km}}.<ref name=\"KMSarkar1927\"/> \n\nThe route of Chandragupta was built over the ancient \"[[Uttarapatha]]\" or the Northern Road, which had been mentioned by [[P\u0101\u1e47ini]]. The emperor [[Ashoka]] had it recorded in his edict about having trees planted, wells built at every half [[Kos (unit)|kos]] and many \"nimisdhayas\", which is often translated as rest-houses along the route. The emperor [[Kanishka]] is also known to have controlled the Uttarapatha.<ref name=\"Vadime\"/>\n\n=== Sur and Mughal Empires ===\n[[Sher Shah Suri]], the medieval ruler of the [[Sur Empire]], took to rebuilding Chandragupta's Royal Road in the 16th century. The old route was further rerouted at [[Sonargaon]] and [[Rohtas district|Rohtas]] and its breadth increased. [[Fruit trees]] and [[shade trees]] were planted. At every 2 kos, a [[Caravanserai|sarai]] was built, the number of [[Kos Minar|kos minars]] and [[Stepwell|baolis]] increased. Gardens were also built alongside some sections of the highway.

Takshashila was well connected by roads with other parts of the Mauryan Empire. The Mauryas had maintained this very ancient highway from Takshashila to [[Patliputra]] (present-day [[Patna]] in India). Chandragupta Maurya had a whole army of officials overseeing the maintenance of this road as told by the Greek diplomat [[Megasthenes]] who spent fifteen years at the Mauryan court. Constructed in eight stages, this road is said to have connected the cities of [[Peshawar|Purushapura]], [[Taxila|Takshashila]], [[Hastinapur]]a, [[Kannauj|Kanyakubja]], [[Allahabad|Prayag]], [[Patliputra]] and [[Tamralipta]], a distance of around {{convert|2600|km}}.<ref name=\"KMSarkar1927\"/> \n\nThe route of Chandragupta was built over the ancient \"[[Uttarapatha]]\" or the Northern Road, which had been mentioned by [[P\u0101\u1e47ini]].

At every 2 kos, a [[Caravanserai|sarai]] was built, the number of [[Kos Minar|kos minars]] and [[Stepwell|baolis]] increased. Gardens were also built alongside some sections of the highway. Those who stopped at the sarai were provided food for free. His son [[Islam Shah Suri]] constructed an additional sarai in-between every sarai originally built by Sher Shah on the road toward Bengal.
