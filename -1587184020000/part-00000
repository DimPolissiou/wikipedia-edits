Current products by DW include [[drum kit]]s, [[snare drum]]s, [[drum hardware|hardware]] and bass pedals.\n\n== History ==\nDrum Workshop was founded in 1972 as a teaching studio by Don Lombardi. It originally offered private lessons and the occasional workshop. Lombardi, along with student (and current Senior Executive Vice President) John Good, began a small drum equipment sales operation to cover the facility's operation costs.\n\nThis operation soon created the first-ever DW product: The height-adjustable trap seat, which was envisioned by Lombardi. The demand became so great that, after accepting an offer to purchase all of [[Camco Drum Company|Camco]]'s manufacturing equipment, the primary focus of the DW operation became drum hardware manufacturing. DW's Camco origins can be seen on their drums today. Following this, the next big product introduced by DW was the 5000 series nylon strap bass drum pedal. This pedal was soon joined by the double bass pedal, the rotating-base, and cable remote [[hi-hat]] stands.\n\n==Expansion, acquisition and new methods==\nDW expanded into larger facilities in [[Oxnard]], [[California]], and grew to oversee a new company, [[Pacific Drums and Percussion]],<ref>[http://www.harmonycentral.com/blogs/News-DWDrums/2010/06/02/pdp-offers-a-new-line-of-affordable-all-maple-snare-drums PDP at Harmonycentral.com]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727122924/http://www.harmonycentral.com/blogs/News-DWDrums/2010/06/02/pdp-offers-a-new-line-of-affordable-all-maple-snare-drums |date=July 27, 2011 }}</ref> a company offering lower-priced drumsets.\n\nDW pioneered{{fact|date=June 2019}} the timbre-matching technique of grouping a set of drumshells together by listening to the note each shell holds before it is sanded. Each shell produced by the Oxnard DW factory is stamped with the note of that shell on the interior.\n\nFor a brief period, DW opened a facility in Ensenada, Mexico, to manufacture its drums and at the same time DW entered the drumstick market with the \"3\" drumstick lineup. The \"3\" drumstick lineup was unique; in that they included three drumsticks in their offering, unlike other manufacturers that sold pairs of two. When DW closed operation at Ensenada facility they ceased the drumstick line.\n\nIn 2015, Drum Workshop Inc acquired and licensed American music instrument brands [[Gretsch Drums]], [[Ovation Guitars]], [[LP (instrument brand)|Latin Percussion]], Toca Percussion, [[Gibraltar Hardware]] and KAT Technologies.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.musicincmag.com/News/2015/150106/150106_KMS.html | title=KMC Music Sells Percussion Brands, Ovation Guitars to Drum Workshop | accessdate=April 25, 2015}}</ref> In November, 2019, DW acquired [[Slingerland Drum Company]] from [[Gibson Guitar Corporation|Gibson]], with plans to introduce Slingerland-branded, vintage style drums to the market in 2020.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://drummagazine.com/dw-buys-slingerland-drum-company-from-gibson/ | title=DW Buys Slingerland Drum Company from Gibson | accessdate=December 11, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=https://drummagazine.com/dws-slingerland-revival-will-begin-with-radio-king-snare-drums/?mc_cid=b95201b39e&mc_eid=a261c28645 | title=DW\u2019s Slingerland Revival Will Begin With Radio King Snare Drums | accessdate=December 11, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Endorsements==\n[[File:Dw Drums Tony Royster Jr.jpg|thumb|250px|Tony Royster, Jr.]]\nMany drummers endorse<ref>[http://www.dwdrums.com/artists/roster.asp List of DW's endorsers]</ref> DW, including [[Tony Royster, Jr.]] ([[Jay-Z]]), [[Chad Smith]] ([[Red Hot Chili Peppers]]), [[Jonathan Moffett|Jonathan \"Sugarfoot\" Moffett]] ([[Michael Jackson]]), Cobus Potgieter (Ventura Lights), Gerald Heyward ([[Chris Brown]]), [[Thomas Pridgen]] ([[The Mars Volta]]), Cora Coleman-Dunham, [[Derek Roddy]] (Serpents Rise), [[Dave Grohl]], [[Stephen Perkins]], [[Dominic Howard]] ([[Muse (band)|Muse]]), Luke Holland ([[The Word Alive]]), [[Alex Gonz\u00e1lez (musician)|Alex Gonz\u00e1lez]] ([[Man\u00e1]], De la Tierra), [[Steve Jocz]] ([[Sum 41]]), [[Brooks Wackerman]] ([[Avenged Sevenfold]]),[[James Sullivan]]([[Avenged Sevenfold]]) ([[Pinkly Smooth]]),[[Scott Travis]] ([[Judas Priest]]), [[Scott Phillips (musician)|Scott Phillips]] ([[Creed (band)|Creed]] and [[Alter Bridge]]), [[Abe Laboriel Jr.]] ([[Paul McCartney]]), [[Sandy Gennaro]], [[Peter Criss]], [[Neil Peart]]<ref>[http://gc.guitarcenter.com/peart/ DW Neil Peart custom drumset] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120708111116/http://gc.guitarcenter.com/peart/ |date=2012-07-08 }}</ref> of [[Rush (band)|Rush]], [[Nick Mason]] of [[Pink Floyd]], [[Danny Seraphine]] ([[Chicago (band)|Chicago]]), Will Berman of [[MGMT]], [[Zak Starkey]], [[Nickelback]] and Martone drummer [[Daniel Adair]], [[Thomas Lang]], [[Terry Bozzio]], the late Troy Penland, [[Roger Taylor (Queen drummer)|Roger Taylor]], [[Max Weinberg]], [[Jos\u00e9 Pasillas]] from [[Incubus (band)|Incubus]], [[Atom Willard]] (Angels & Airwaves), [[Glen Sobel]] The hired gun of ([[Alice Cooper]]) and Other Bands and [[Christoph Schneider]] ([[Rammstein]]).\n\nOthers include [[Jason Bonham]] ([[Black Country Communion]], [[Led Zeppelin]])\n[[Tommy Clufetos]] ([[Black Sabbath]], [[Ozzy Osbourne]], [[Rob Zombie]], [[Alice Cooper]], [[Ted Nugent]]), [[Kelly Keagy]] ([[Night Ranger]]), Bruce Becker ([[David Becker]] Tribune), Victor Loyo (Luis Miguel and studio session drummer), [[Eric Moore (musician)|Eric Moore]] ([[Suicidal Tendencies]] and [[Infectious Grooves]]), Rex Hardy Jr. ([[Mary J.

With shallow toms and the bass drum pedal operating on the floor tom lower head, this 4-piece kit plays like a [[Drum kit#Five-piece|5-piece]] and takes up the space of a [[Drum kit#Small kits|2-piece]].\n*Gong Drum \u2013 A large single-headed 10-ply maple drum with a 21\" or 23\" diameter mounted on a stand and intended to be struck with a drumstick. It aims for a sound between a tom and a bass drum. \n*Woofer \u2013 An 8\" deep by 18\" to 28\" wide drum mounted in front of the bass drum. It amplifies the low-end punch of the bass drum and includes a pre-installed AKG D112BD internal mic.\n*Piccolo Toms \u2013 2.5\" deep steel toms available in 8\", 10\", and 12\" diameters.\n*Rata Toms \u2013  Similar to [[octoban]]s, single headed toms made from North American maple with a 6\" diameter and varying depth options. It produces a loud crack.<ref>http://dwdrums.com/drums/collectors/specialty.asp retrieved 13 February 2012</ref>\n\n==Snare drums==\nDW manufactures an assortment of snare drums. Available are made to order snares, which can be customized, or mass-produced snare drums. All DW snares come standard with True-Tone snare wires, 3.0mm True-Hoops, Remo batter/resonant heads and True-Pitch Tension Rods. Introduced in 2009 was the DW \"Mag Throw-off\", which is a snare throw-off system that uses a three-way butt plate with three different settings: loose, medium, and tight.\n\n==Hardware==\nIn addition to making drums, DW has also makes drum hardware.

Current products by DW include [[drum kit]]s, [[snare drum]]s, [[drum hardware|hardware]] and bass pedals.\n\n== History ==\nDrum Workshop was founded in 1972 as a teaching studio by Don Lombardi. It originally offered private lessons and the occasional workshop. Lombardi, along with student (and current Senior Executive Vice President) John Good, began a small drum equipment sales operation to cover the facility's operation costs.\n\nThis operation soon created the first-ever DW product: The height-adjustable trap seat, which was envisioned by Lombardi. The demand became so great that, after accepting an offer to purchase all of [[Camco Drum Company|Camco]]'s manufacturing equipment, the primary focus of the DW operation became drum hardware manufacturing. DW's Camco origins can be seen on their drums today. Following this, the next big product introduced by DW was the 5000 series nylon strap bass drum pedal. This pedal was soon joined by the double bass pedal, the rotating-base, and cable remote [[hi-hat]] stands.\n\n==Expansion, acquisition and new methods==\nDW expanded into larger facilities in [[Oxnard]], [[California]], and grew to oversee a new company, [[Pacific Drums and Percussion]],<ref>[http://www.harmonycentral.com/blogs/News-DWDrums/2010/06/02/pdp-offers-a-new-line-of-affordable-all-maple-snare-drums PDP at Harmonycentral.com]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727122924/http://www.harmonycentral.com/blogs/News-DWDrums/2010/06/02/pdp-offers-a-new-line-of-affordable-all-maple-snare-drums |date=July 27, 2011 }}</ref> a company offering lower-priced drumsets.\n\nDW pioneered{{fact|date=June 2019}} the timbre-matching technique of grouping a set of drumshells together by listening to the note each shell holds before it is sanded. Each shell produced by the Oxnard DW factory is stamped with the note of that shell on the interior.\n\nFor a brief period, DW opened a facility in Ensenada, Mexico, to manufacture its drums and at the same time DW entered the drumstick market with the \"3\" drumstick lineup. The \"3\" drumstick lineup was unique; in that they included three drumsticks in their offering, unlike other manufacturers that sold pairs of two. When DW closed operation at Ensenada facility they ceased the drumstick line.\n\nIn 2015, Drum Workshop Inc acquired and licensed American music instrument brands [[Gretsch Drums]], [[Ovation Guitars]], [[LP (instrument brand)|Latin Percussion]], Toca Percussion, [[Gibraltar Hardware]] and KAT Technologies.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.musicincmag.com/News/2015/150106/150106_KMS.html | title=KMC Music Sells Percussion Brands, Ovation Guitars to Drum Workshop | accessdate=April 25, 2015}}</ref> In November, 2019, DW acquired [[Slingerland Drum Company]] from [[Gibson]], with plans to introduce Slingerland-branded, vintage style drums to the market in 2020.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://drummagazine.com/dw-buys-slingerland-drum-company-from-gibson/ | title=DW Buys Slingerland Drum Company from Gibson | accessdate=December 11, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=https://drummagazine.com/dws-slingerland-revival-will-begin-with-radio-king-snare-drums/?mc_cid=b95201b39e&mc_eid=a261c28645 | title=DW\u2019s Slingerland Revival Will Begin With Radio King Snare Drums | accessdate=December 11, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Endorsements==\n[[File:Dw Drums Tony Royster Jr.jpg|thumb|250px|Tony Royster, Jr.]]\nMany drummers endorse<ref>[http://www.dwdrums.com/artists/roster.asp List of DW's endorsers]</ref> DW, including [[Tony Royster, Jr.]] ([[Jay-Z]]), [[Chad Smith]] ([[Red Hot Chili Peppers]]), [[Jonathan Moffett|Jonathan \"Sugarfoot\" Moffett]] ([[Michael Jackson]]), Cobus Potgieter (Ventura Lights), Gerald Heyward ([[Chris Brown]]), [[Thomas Pridgen]] ([[The Mars Volta]]), Cora Coleman-Dunham, [[Derek Roddy]] (Serpents Rise), [[Dave Grohl]], [[Stephen Perkins]], [[Dominic Howard]] ([[Muse (band)|Muse]]), Luke Holland ([[The Word Alive]]), [[Alex Gonz\u00e1lez (musician)|Alex Gonz\u00e1lez]] ([[Man\u00e1]], De la Tierra), [[Steve Jocz]] ([[Sum 41]]), [[Brooks Wackerman]] ([[Avenged Sevenfold]]),[[James Sullivan]]([[Avenged Sevenfold]]) ([[Pinkly Smooth]]),[[Scott Travis]] ([[Judas Priest]]), [[Scott Phillips (musician)|Scott Phillips]] ([[Creed (band)|Creed]] and [[Alter Bridge]]), [[Abe Laboriel Jr.]] ([[Paul McCartney]]), [[Sandy Gennaro]], [[Peter Criss]], [[Neil Peart]]<ref>[http://gc.guitarcenter.com/peart/ DW Neil Peart custom drumset] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120708111116/http://gc.guitarcenter.com/peart/ |date=2012-07-08 }}</ref> of [[Rush (band)|Rush]], [[Nick Mason]] of [[Pink Floyd]], [[Danny Seraphine]] ([[Chicago (band)|Chicago]]), Will Berman of [[MGMT]], [[Zak Starkey]], [[Nickelback]] and Martone drummer [[Daniel Adair]], [[Thomas Lang]], [[Terry Bozzio]], the late Troy Penland, [[Roger Taylor (Queen drummer)|Roger Taylor]], [[Max Weinberg]], [[Jos\u00e9 Pasillas]] from [[Incubus (band)|Incubus]], [[Atom Willard]] (Angels & Airwaves), [[Glen Sobel]] The hired gun of ([[Alice Cooper]]) and Other Bands and [[Christoph Schneider]] ([[Rammstein]]).\n\nOthers include [[Jason Bonham]] ([[Black Country Communion]], [[Led Zeppelin]])\n[[Tommy Clufetos]] ([[Black Sabbath]], [[Ozzy Osbourne]], [[Rob Zombie]], [[Alice Cooper]], [[Ted Nugent]]), [[Kelly Keagy]] ([[Night Ranger]]), Bruce Becker ([[David Becker]] Tribune), Victor Loyo (Luis Miguel and studio session drummer), [[Eric Moore (musician)|Eric Moore]] ([[Suicidal Tendencies]] and [[Infectious Grooves]]), Rex Hardy Jr. ([[Mary J.

Available are made to order snares, which can be customized, or mass-produced snare drums. All DW snares come standard with True-Tone snare wires, 3.0mm True-Hoops, Remo batter/resonant heads and True-Pitch Tension Rods. Introduced in 2009 was the DW \"Mag Throw-off\", which is a snare throw-off system that uses a three-way butt plate with three different settings: loose, medium, and tight.\n\n==Hardware==\nIn addition to making drums, DW has also makes drum hardware. Most of DW's hardware feature its patented \"TechLock\" on their cymbal stands, which uses a drum key to lock the cymbal tilters in place, preventing slippage. Also unique to DW is the development of the DogBone system, which minimizes the use of multiple cymbal stands.
