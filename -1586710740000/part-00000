[[Secretary of the Treasury]] [[Alexander Hamilton]] lobbied Congress to fund the construction of ten [[Cutter (boat)|cutters]], which it did on 4 August 1790 (now celebrated as the Coast Guard's official birthday). Until the re-establishment of the Navy in 1798, these \"revenue cutters\" were the only naval force of the early United States. As such, the cutters and their crews frequently took on additional duties, including combating piracy, rescuing mariners in distress, ferrying government officials, and even carrying mail.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1122007,00.html |title=How the Coast Guard Gets it Right |first=Amanda |last=Ripley |journal=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=23 October 2005 |access-date=11 February 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071222051431/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1122007,00.html |archive-date=22 December 2007 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe modern Coast Guard was created in 1915, when the Revenue Cutter Service merged with the [[United States Life-Saving Service|U.S. Life-Saving Service]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uscg.mil/history/articles/h_USLHSchron.asp|title=Historic Light Stations|publisher=U.S. Coast Guard|accessdate=21 January 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150121115043/http://www.uscg.mil/history/articles/h_USLHSchron.asp|archive-date=21 January 2015|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> In 1939, the [[United States Lighthouse Service|Lighthouse Service]] was brought under the Coast Guard's purview.

Approximately 200 cadets graduate each year, receiving a [[Bachelor of Science|Bachelor of Science degree]] and a commission as an [[Ensign (rank)|ensign]] in the Coast Guard. Graduates are obligated to serve a minimum of five years on active duty. Most graduates are assigned to duty aboard Coast Guard cutters immediately after graduation, either as Deck Watch Officers (DWOs) or as Engineer Officers in Training (EOITs). Smaller numbers are assigned directly to flight training at [[Naval Air Station Pensacola]], Florida or to shore duty at Coast Guard [[United States Coast Guard Sectors|Sector]], District, or Area headquarters units.\n\nIn addition to the Academy, prospective officers, who already hold a college degree, may enter the Coast Guard through [[Officer Candidate School]] (OCS), also located at the Coast Guard Academy. OCS is a 17-week course of instruction that prepares candidates to serve effectively as officers in the Coast Guard. In addition to indoctrinating students into a military lifestyle, OCS provides a wide range of highly technical information necessary to perform the duties of a Coast Guard officer.\n\nGraduates of OCS are usually commissioned as ensigns, but some with advanced graduate degrees may enter as [[Lieutenant (junior grade)|lieutenants (junior grade)]] or [[lieutenant]]s. Graduating OCS officers entering active duty are required to serve a minimum of three years, while graduating reserve officers are required to serve four years. Graduates may be assigned to a cutter, flight training, a staff job, or an operations ashore billet.\n\nOCS is the primary channel through which the Coast Guard enlisted grades ascend to the commissioned officer corps.\n\nLawyers, engineers, intelligence officers, military aviators holding commissions in other branches of the U.S. Armed Forces requesting interservice transfers to the Coast Guard, graduates of maritime academies, and certain other individuals may also receive an officer's commission in the Coast Guard through the [[Direct Commission Officer]] (DCO) program. Depending on the specific program and the background of the individual, the course is three, four or five weeks long. The first week of the five-week course is an indoctrination week. The DCO program is designed to commission officers with highly specialized professional training or certain kinds of previous military experience.\n\nUnlike the other military services, the Coast Guard does not have a [[Reserve Officers' Training Corps]] (ROTC) program.\n\n====Recruit training====\n[[File:Flags Across America 111105-G-ZR255-029.jpg|thumb|Recruit companies visiting Arlington National Cemetery for their one day of off-base liberty, which is their only break in an eight-week boot camp at the Coast Guard Training Center in Cape May, New Jersey]]\nNewly enlisted personnel are sent to eight weeks of [[recruit training]] at [[United States Coast Guard Training Center Cape May|Coast Guard Training Center Cape May]] in [[Cape May, New Jersey]]. New recruits arrive at [[Charles W. Sexton|Sexton Hall]] and remain there for three days of initial processing which includes haircuts, vaccinations, uniform issue, and other necessary entrance procedures. During this initial processing period, the new recruits are led by temporary company commanders. These temporary company commanders are tasked with teaching the new recruits how to march and preparing them to enter into their designated company. The temporary company commanders typically do not enforce any physical activity such as push ups or crunches. When the initial processing is complete, the new seaman recruits are introduced to their permanent company commanders who will remain with them until the end of training. There is typically a designated lead company commander and two support company commanders. The balance of the eight-week boot camp is spent in learning teamwork and developing physical skills. An introduction of how the Coast Guard operates with special emphasis on the Coast Guard's core values is an important part of the training.\n\nThe current nine Recruit Training Objectives are:\n* [[Self-discipline]]\n* Military skills\n* [[Shooting|Marksmanship]]\n* Vocational skills and academics\n* Military bearing\n* Physical fitness and wellness\n* Water survival and swim qualifications\n* [[Esprit de corps]]\n* [[U.S. Coast Guard#Symbols|Core values]] (Honor, Respect, and Devotion to Duty)\n\n====Service schools====\nFollowing graduation from recruit training, most members are sent to their first unit while they await orders to attend advanced training in [[Class \"A\" Schools]]. At \"A\" schools, Coast Guard enlisted personnel are trained in their chosen [[List of United States Coast Guard ratings|rating]]; rating is a Coast Guard and Navy term for enlisted skills synonymous with the Army's and Marine Corps' [[United States military occupation codes|military occupation codes]] (MOS) and Air Force's [[Air Force Specialty Code]] (AFSC). Members who earned high [[ASVAB]] scores or who were otherwise guaranteed an \"A\" School of choice while enlisting may go directly to their \"A\" School upon graduation from Boot Camp.\n\n===Civilian personnel and Specialty rates===\nThe Coast Guard employs over 8,577 civilians in over two hundred different job types including [[Coast Guard Investigative Service]] [[special agents]], lawyers, engineers, technicians, administrative personnel, tradesmen, and federal firefighters.<ref name=\"uscg.mil\"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uscg.mil/civilian/default.asp |title=USCG Civilian Careers |publisher=United States Coast Guard |date=28 June 2013 |access-date=16 March 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100110052727/http://www.uscg.mil/civilian/default.asp |archive-date=10 January 2010 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Civilian employees work at various levels in the Coast Guard to support its various missions.\n\n==Equipment==\n{{main|List of equipment of the United States Coast Guard}}\n\n===Cutters===\n[[File:USCG National Security Cutter BERTHOLF (WMSL-750).jpeg|thumb|right|{{USCGC|Bertholf|WMSL-750}}, the first Legend-class national security cutters]]\nThe Coast Guard operates 243 Cutters,<ref name=\"uscg.mil1\"/> defined as any vessel  more than {{convert|65|ft}} long, that has a permanently assigned crew and accommodations for the extended support of that crew.<ref name=cutterdef>{{cite web |url=http://www.uscg.mil/directives/cim/5000-5999/CIM_5000_3B.pdf#page=122 |format=PDF |title=United States Coast Guard Regulations, Chapter 10 \u2013 Classification and Status of Coast Guard Vessels |year=1992 |id=COMDINSTM 5000.3B |access-date=6 August 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103063017/http://www.uscg.mil/directives/cim/5000-5999/CIM_5000_3B.pdf#page=122 |archive-date=3 November 2013 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n* [[National Security Cutter]] (WMSL): Also known as the \"Legend\"-class, these are the Coast Guard's latest class of {{convert|418|ft|m|adj=on}} military defense  maritime ship.

Most of these air stations are tenant activities at civilian airports, several of which are former Air Force Bases and Naval Air Stations, although several are also independent military facilities. Coast Guard Air Stations are also located on active Naval Air Stations, [[Air National Guard]] bases, and Army Air Fields.\n\nCoast Guard aviators receive Primary (fixed-wing) and Advanced (fixed or rotary-wing) flight training with their Navy and Marine Corps counterparts at [[NAS Whiting Field]], Florida, and [[NAS Corpus Christi]], Texas, and are considered [[United States Naval Aviator|Naval Aviators]]. After receiving [[Naval Aviator insignia|Naval Aviator Wings]], Coast Guard pilots, with the exception of those slated to fly the HC-130, report to [[Coast Guard Aviation Training Center|U.S. Coast Guard Aviation Training Center, Mobile, Alabama]] to receive 6\u201312 weeks of specialized training in the Coast Guard fleet aircraft they will operate. HC-130 pilots report to [[Little Rock AFB]], Arkansas, for joint C-130 training under the auspices of the [[314th Airlift Wing]] of the [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]].\n\nFixed-wing aircraft operate from Air Stations on long-duration missions. Helicopters operate from Air Stations and can deploy on a number of different cutters. Helicopters can rescue people or intercept vessels smuggling migrants or narcotics. Since the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001, the Coast Guard has developed a more prominent role in national security and now has armed helicopters operating in high-risk areas for the purpose of maritime law enforcement and anti-terrorism.\n\nThe Coast Guard is now developing an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) program that will utilize the [[General Atomics MQ-9 Reaper#US Homeland Security|MQ-9 Reaper]] platform for homeland security and search/rescue operations. To support this endeavor, the Coast Guard has partnered with the Navy and [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection]] to study existing/emerging unmanned aerial system (UAS) capabilities within their respective organizations. As these systems mature, research and operational experience gleaned from this joint effort will enable the Coast Guard to develop its own cutter and land-based UAS capabilities.\n\n{{avilisthead|nonstandard}}\n|-\n!

The 3-inch gun's high rate of fire and availability of specialized ammunition make it a multi-purpose gun capable of anti-shipping, anti-aircraft, ground support and short-range anti-missile defense.\n*The MK 110 57mm gun, a radar-guided computer controlled variant of the [[Bofors 57 mm L/70 naval artillery gun|Bofors 57 mm gun]]. It is used on the [[Legend-class cutter|Legend-class cutter, also known as the National Security Cutter (NSC)]]. It is a multi-purpose gun capable of anti-shipping, anti-aircraft, and short-range anti-missile defense. The stealth mount has a reduced radar profile. Also, the gun has a small radar mounted on the gun barrel to measure muzzle velocity for fire control purposes and can change ammunition types instantly due to a dual-feed system. It can also be operated/fired manually using a joystick and video camera (mounted on gun).\n*The [[M242 Bushmaster|Mk 38 Mod 0]] weapons system consists of an M242 Bushmaster 25mm chain gun and the Mk 88 Mod 0 machine gun mount. A manned system, its gyro-stabilization compensates for the pitching deck. It provides ships with defensive and offensive gunfire capability for the engagement of a variety of surface targets. Designed primarily as a close-range defensive measure, it provides protection against patrol boats, floating mines, and various shore-based targets.\n*The [[M242 Bushmaster|Mk 38 Mod 2]] weapons system is a remotely operated Mk 38 with an electronic optical sight, laser range-finder, [[FLIR]], a more reliable feeding system, all of which enhance the weapon systems capabilities and accuracy.\n*The [[Phalanx CIWS]] (pronounced \"sea-wiz\") is a close-in weapon system for defense against aircraft and anti-ship missiles. it can also be used against a variety of surface targets. Consisting of a radar-guided 20&nbsp;mm 6-barreled [[M61 Vulcan]] cannon mounted on a swiveling base, it is used on the Coast Guard's High Endurance Cutters. This system can operate autonomously against airborne threats or may be manually operated with the use of electronic optical sight, laser range-finder and FLIR systems against surface targets.\n*The [[CROWS|Sea PROTECTOR MK50]] is a remotely controlled gyro-stabilized [[M2 Browning machine gun|M2 .50 caliber heavy machine gun]]. The sight package includes a daylight video camera, a thermal camera and an eye-safe laser rangefinder operated by a joystick.

Conversely, black-hulled cutters (such as buoy tenders and inland construction tenders) use the standard racing stripe. Auxiliary vessels maintained by the Coast Guard also carry the Racing Stripe, but in inverted colors (i.e., broad blue stripe with narrow white and CG red stripes) and the Auxiliary shield.\n\nThe Racing Stripe, officially known as the Service Mark, was designed in 1964 by the industrial design office of [[Raymond Loewy]] Associates to give the Coast Guard a distinctive, modern image.

These were minor, primarily consisting of distinctive cap devices for officers and chief petty officers, incorporation of the Coast Guard shield in lieu of line or staff corps insignia for officers, and different buttons on dress uniforms.\n\nIn 1974, the current Coast Guard Service Dress Blue \"Bravo\" uniform was introduced for wear by both officers and enlisted personnel; the transition was completed during 1974. The uniform consists of a blue four-pocket single breasted jacket and trousers, a light-blue button-up shirt with a pointed collar, two front button-flap pockets, and shoulder loops, along with a tie of the same shade as the jacket are worn with the uniform.

Additionally, a sword may be prescribed for officers, and white gloves may be required. A white belt may be worn for [[honor guard]]s.\n\nThe Tropical Blue uniform, worn in warm weather, omits the jacket and tie, and features a short-sleeved, light blue shirt (identical to that worn by the [[U.S. Air Force]]) with rank insignia on shoulder boards for officers, and pin-on collar insignia for petty officers. The Tropical Blue uniform may be worn year-round for general office wear and for visits between commands. It may be worn in lieu of the SDB uniform, but not to functions where civilian dress is coat and tie.<ref name=\"UniformRegs\" />\n\nDespite the transition to distinctive \"Bender's blues\" uniforms in the 1970s, some Navy-style dress uniforms were retained. The Service Dress White and Full Dress White \"choker\" uniforms for officers are identical to those worn by U.S. Navy officers (aside from service-specific buttons, insignia and sword design). These are typically used for formal parade and [[Change of command|change-of-command]] ceremonies. For similar occasions the enlisted members wear Tropical Blue, Service Dress Blue or Full Dress Blue. The [[mess dress|dinner dress]] uniforms worn for formal (black tie) evening ceremonies are also identical to those of the Navy, aside from Coast Guard-specific insignia. As in the Navy, these uniforms are required for officers, but optional for enlisted members. Due to the expense of these uniforms and the fact that they are rarely called-for, few junior enlisted members purchase them.\n\n[[File:Members of the U.S. Coast Guard Pipe Band march up Fifth Avenue in the 250th St. Patrick's Day Parade, Manhattan, N.Y., March 17, 2010.jpg|thumb|The U.S. Coast Guard Pipe Band in New York during the 2010 [[Saint Patrick's Day in the United States#New York City|St. Patrick's Day Parade]]]]\n\nThe current working uniform of the Coast Guard is the [[Operational Dress Uniform]] (ODU). The ODU may be worn year-round primarily as a field utility and watchstanding uniform, but may also be worn in an office environment where appropriate. The ODU is similar to the old-style [[Battle Dress Uniform]] previously worn by all branches of the U.S. Armed Forces, both in function and style. However, the ODU is in a solid dark blue with no camouflage pattern and does not have lower pockets on the blouse. The first generation ODU, in service from 2004 to 2012, was worn with the blouse tucked into the trousers. The second generation ODU is worn with the blouse untucked and has black Coast Guard insignia embroidered on the right breast pocket as well as the side pockets of the trousers. The ODU is worn with composite-toed boots in most circumstances, but low-cut brown boat shoes may be prescribed for certain vessel boarding operations. A standard baseball-style ball cap is worn, embroidered in gold block lettering with \"U.S. Coast Guard.\" Units may also additionally authorize ball caps with the unit name embroidered for wear while on the unit. A foul weather parka is the outerwear worn with the ODU. The ODU's success and practicality as a working uniform has led the [[U.S. Public Health Service]] and the [[NOAA Corps]] to adopt ODU variants as standard working uniforms. Some Navy personnel also advocated adoption of the ODU as a standard shipboard uniform for the Navy, rather than the unpopular [[Navy Working Uniform]] Type I.\n\nCoast Guard personnel serving in expeditionary combat units such as [[Port Security Unit]]s or Law Enforcement Detachments, and Coast Guard personnel deployed overseas (e.g. [[PATFORSWA]]) wear the [[Navy Working Uniform]] Type III with distinctive Coast Guard insignia, and generally follow Navy Uniform Regulations.\n\n[[File:USCG Cadet Fall Parade Uniform.jpg|thumb|left|Coast Guard cadets wearing Full Dress Blue (B) uniforms]]\nAll Coast Guardsmen wear the [[Peaked cap|combination cap]] with all uniforms except the ODU and CUU.

Coast Guard reservists possess the same training and qualifications as their active duty counterparts, and as such, can be found augmenting active duty Coast Guard units every day.\n\nDuring the [[Vietnam War]] and shortly thereafter, the Coast Guard considered abandoning the reserve program, but the force was instead reoriented into force augmentation, where its principal focus was not just reserve operations, but to add to the readiness and mission execution of every-day active duty personnel.\n\nSince 11 September 2001, reservists have been activated and served on tours of active duty, to include deployments to the [[Persian Gulf]] and also as parts of Department of Defense combatant commands such as the [[United States Northern Command|U.S. Northern]] and [[United States Central Command|Central]] Commands. Coast Guard Port Security Units are entirely staffed with reservists, except for five to seven active duty personnel. Additionally, most of the staffing the Coast Guard provides to the Navy Expeditionary Combat Command are reservists.\n\nThe Reserve is managed by the Assistant Commandant for Reserve, Rear Admiral Todd C.

[[Secretary of the Treasury]] [[Alexander Hamilton]] lobbied Congress to fund the construction of ten [[Cutter (boat)|cutters]], which it did on 4 August 1790 (now celebrated as the Coast Guard's official birthday). Until the re-establishment of the Navy in 1798, these \"revenue cutters\" were the only naval force of the early United States. As such, the cutters and their crews frequently took on additional duties, including combating piracy, rescuing mariners in distress, ferrying government officials, and even carrying mail.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1122007,00.html |title=How the Coast Guard Gets it Right |first=Amanda |last=Ripley |journal=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=23 October 2005 |access-date=11 February 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071222051431/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1122007,00.html |archive-date=22 December 2007 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe modern Coast Guard was created in 1915, when the Revenue Cutter Service merged with the [[United States Life-Saving Service|U.S. Life-Saving Service]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uscg.mil/history/articles/h_USLHSchron.asp|title=Historic Light Stations|publisher=U.S. Coast Guard|accessdate=21 January 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150121115043/http://www.uscg.mil/history/articles/h_USLHSchron.asp|archive-date=21 January 2015|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> In 1939, the [[United States Lighthouse Service|Lighthouse Service]] was brought under the Coast Guard's purview.

Approximately 200 cadets graduate each year, receiving a [[Bachelor of Science|Bachelor of Science degree]] and a commission as an [[Ensign (rank)|ensign]] in the Coast Guard. Graduates are obligated to serve a minimum of five years on active duty. Most graduates are assigned to duty aboard Coast Guard cutters immediately after graduation, either as Deck Watch Officers (DWOs) or as Engineer Officers in Training (EOITs). Smaller numbers are assigned directly to flight training at [[Naval Air Station Pensacola]], Florida or to shore duty at Coast Guard [[United States Coast Guard Sectors|Sector]], District, or Area headquarters units.\n\nIn addition to the Academy, prospective officers, who already hold a college degree, may enter the Coast Guard through [[Officer Candidate School]] (OCS), also located at the Coast Guard Academy. OCS is a 17-week course of instruction that prepares candidates to serve effectively as officers in the Coast Guard. In addition to indoctrinating students into a military lifestyle, OCS provides a wide range of highly technical information necessary to perform the duties of a Coast Guard officer.\n\nGraduates of OCS are usually commissioned as ensigns, but some with advanced graduate degrees may enter as [[Lieutenant (junior grade)|lieutenants (junior grade)]] or [[lieutenant]]s. Graduating OCS officers entering active duty are required to serve a minimum of three years, while graduating reserve officers are required to serve four years. Graduates may be assigned to a cutter, flight training, a staff job, or an operations ashore billet.\n\nOCS is the primary channel through which the Coast Guard enlisted grades ascend to the commissioned officer corps.\n\nLawyers, engineers, intelligence officers, military aviators holding commissions in other branches of the U.S. Armed Forces requesting interservice transfers to the Coast Guard, graduates of maritime academies, and certain other individuals may also receive an officer's commission in the Coast Guard through the [[Direct Commission Officer]] (DCO) program. Depending on the specific program and the background of the individual, the course is three, four or five weeks long. The first week of the five-week course is an indoctrination week. The DCO program is designed to commission officers with highly specialized professional training or certain kinds of previous military experience.\n\nUnlike the other military services, the Coast Guard does not have a [[Reserve Officers' Training Corps]] (ROTC) program.\n\n====Recruit training====\n[[File:Flags Across America 111105-G-ZR255-029.jpg|thumb|Recruit companies visiting Arlington National Cemetery for their one day of off-base liberty, which is their only break in an eight-week boot camp at the Coast Guard Training Center in Cape May, New Jersey]]\nNewly enlisted personnel are sent to eight weeks of [[recruit training]] at [[United States Coast Guard Training Center Cape May|Coast Guard Training Center Cape May]] in [[Cape May, New Jersey]]. New recruits arrive at [[Charles W. Sexton|Sexton Hall]] and remain there for three days of initial processing which includes haircuts, vaccinations, uniform issue, and other necessary entrance procedures. During this initial processing period, the new recruits are led by temporary company commanders. These temporary company commanders are tasked with teaching the new recruits how to march and preparing them to enter into their designated company. The temporary company commanders typically do not enforce any physical activity such as push ups or crunches. When the initial processing is complete, the new seaman recruits are introduced to their permanent company commanders who will remain with them until the end of training. There is typically a designated lead company commander and two support company commanders. The balance of the eight-week boot camp is spent in learning teamwork and developing physical skills. An introduction of how the Coast Guard operates with special emphasis on the Coast Guard's core values is an important part of the training.\n\nThe current nine Recruit Training Objectives are:\n* [[Self-discipline]]\n* Military skills\n* [[Shooting|Marksmanship]]\n* Vocational skills and academics\n* Military bearing\n* Physical fitness and wellness\n* Water survival and swim qualifications\n* [[Esprit de corps]]\n* [[U.S. Coast Guard#Symbols|Core values]] (Honor, Respect, and Devotion to Duty)\n\n====Service schools====\nFollowing graduation from recruit training, most members are sent to their first unit while they await orders to attend advanced training in [[Class \"A\" Schools]]. At \"A\" schools, Coast Guard enlisted personnel are trained in their chosen [[List of United States Coast Guard ratings|rating]]; rating is a Coast Guard and Navy term for enlisted skills synonymous with the Army's and Marine Corps' [[United States military occupation codes|military occupation codes]] (MOS) and Air Force's [[Air Force Specialty Code]] (AFSC). Members who earned high [[ASVAB]] scores or who were otherwise guaranteed an \"A\" School of choice while enlisting may go directly to their \"A\" School upon graduation from Boot Camp.\n\n===Civilian personnel and Specialty rates===\nThe Coast Guard employs over 8,577 civilians in over two hundred different job types including [[Coast Guard Investigative Service]] [[special agents]], lawyers, engineers, technicians, administrative personnel, tradesmen, and federal firefighters.<ref name=\"uscg.mil\"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uscg.mil/civilian/default.asp |title=USCG Civilian Careers |publisher=United States Coast Guard |date=28 June 2013 |access-date=16 March 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100110052727/http://www.uscg.mil/civilian/default.asp |archive-date=10 January 2010 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Civilian employees work at various levels in the Coast Guard to support its various missions.\n\n==Equipment==\n{{main|List of equipment of the United States Coast Guard}}\n\n===Cutters===\n[[File:USCG National Security Cutter BERTHOLF (WMSL-750).jpeg|thumb|right|{{USCGC|Bertholf|WMSL-750}}, the first Legend-class national security cutters]]\nThe Coast Guard operates 243 Cutters,<ref name=\"uscg.mil1\"/> defined as any vessel  more than {{convert|65|ft}} long, that has a permanently assigned crew and accommodations for the extended support of that crew.<ref name=cutterdef>{{cite web |url=http://www.uscg.mil/directives/cim/5000-5999/CIM_5000_3B.pdf#page=122 |format=PDF |title=United States Coast Guard Regulations, Chapter 10 \u2013 Classification and Status of Coast Guard Vessels |year=1992 |id=COMDINSTM 5000.3B |access-date=6 August 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103063017/http://www.uscg.mil/directives/cim/5000-5999/CIM_5000_3B.pdf#page=122 |archive-date=3 November 2013 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n* [[National Security Cutter]] (WMSL): Also known as the \"Legend\"-class, these are the Coast Guard's latest class of {{convert|418|ft|m|adj=on}} military defense  maritime ship.

Most of these air stations are tenant activities at civilian airports, several of which are former Air Force Bases and Naval Air Stations, although several are also independent military facilities. Coast Guard Air Stations are also located on active Naval Air Stations, [[Air National Guard]] bases, and Army Air Fields.\n\nCoast Guard aviators receive Primary (fixed-wing) and Advanced (fixed or rotary-wing) flight training with their Navy and Marine Corps counterparts at [[NAS Whiting Field]], Florida, and [[NAS Corpus Christi]], Texas, and are considered [[United States Naval Aviator|Naval Aviators]]. After receiving [[Naval Aviator insignia|Naval Aviator Wings]], Coast Guard pilots, with the exception of those slated to fly the HC-130, report to [[Coast Guard Aviation Training Center|U.S. Coast Guard Aviation Training Center, Mobile, Alabama]] to receive 6\u201312 weeks of specialized training in the Coast Guard fleet aircraft they will operate. HC-130 pilots report to [[Little Rock AFB]], Arkansas, for joint C-130 training under the auspices of the [[314th Airlift Wing]] of the [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]].\n\nFixed-wing aircraft operate from Air Stations on long-duration missions. Helicopters operate from Air Stations and can deploy on a number of different cutters. Helicopters can rescue people or intercept vessels smuggling migrants or narcotics. Since the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001, the Coast Guard has developed a more prominent role in national security and now has armed helicopters operating in high-risk areas for the purpose of maritime law enforcement and anti-terrorism.\n\nThe Coast Guard is now developing an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) program that will utilize the [[General Atomics MQ-9 Reaper#US Homeland Security|MQ-9 Reaper]] platform for homeland security and search/rescue operations. To support this endeavor, the Coast Guard has partnered with the Navy and [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection]] to study existing/emerging unmanned aerial system (UAS) capabilities within their respective organizations. As these systems mature, research and operational experience gleaned from this joint effort will enable the Coast Guard to develop its own cutter and land-based UAS capabilities.\n\n{{avilisthead|nonstandard}}\n|-\n!

The 3-inch gun's high rate of fire and availability of specialized ammunition make it a multi-purpose gun capable of anti-shipping, anti-aircraft, ground support and short-range anti-missile defense.\n*The MK 110 57mm gun, a radar-guided computer controlled variant of the [[Bofors 57 mm L/70 naval artillery gun|Bofors 57 mm gun]]. It is used on the [[Legend-class cutter|Legend-class cutter, also known as the National Security Cutter (NSC)]]. It is a multi-purpose gun capable of anti-shipping, anti-aircraft, and short-range anti-missile defense. The stealth mount has a reduced radar profile. Also, the gun has a small radar mounted on the gun barrel to measure muzzle velocity for fire control purposes and can change ammunition types instantly due to a dual-feed system. It can also be operated/fired manually using a joystick and video camera (mounted on gun).\n*The [[M242 Bushmaster|Mk 38 Mod 0]] weapons system consists of an M242 Bushmaster 25mm chain gun and the Mk 88 Mod 0 machine gun mount. A manned system, its gyro-stabilization compensates for the pitching deck. It provides ships with defensive and offensive gunfire capability for the engagement of a variety of surface targets. Designed primarily as a close-range defensive measure, it provides protection against patrol boats, floating mines, and various shore-based targets.\n*The [[M242 Bushmaster|Mk 38 Mod 2]] weapons system is a remotely operated Mk 38 with an electronic optical sight, laser range-finder, [[FLIR]], a more reliable feeding system, all of which enhance the weapon systems capabilities and accuracy.\n*The [[Phalanx CIWS]] (pronounced \"sea-wiz\") is a close-in weapon system for defense against aircraft and anti-ship missiles. it can also be used against a variety of surface targets. Consisting of a radar-guided 20&nbsp;mm 6-barreled [[M61 Vulcan]] cannon mounted on a swiveling base, it is used on the Coast Guard's High Endurance Cutters. This system can operate autonomously against airborne threats or may be manually operated with the use of electronic optical sight, laser range-finder and FLIR systems against surface targets.\n*The [[CROWS|Sea PROTECTOR MK50]] is a remotely controlled gyro-stabilized [[M2 Browning machine gun|M2 .50 caliber heavy machine gun]]. The sight package includes a daylight video camera, a thermal camera and an eye-safe laser rangefinder operated by a joystick.

Conversely, black-hulled cutters (such as buoy tenders and inland construction tenders) use the standard racing stripe. Auxiliary vessels maintained by the Coast Guard also carry the Racing Stripe, but in inverted colors (i.e., broad blue stripe with narrow white and CG red stripes) and the Auxiliary shield.\n\nThe Racing Stripe, officially known as the Service Mark, was designed in 1964 by the industrial design office of [[Raymond Loewy]] Associates to give the Coast Guard a distinctive, modern image.

These were minor, primarily consisting of distinctive cap devices for officers and chief petty officers, incorporation of the Coast Guard shield in lieu of line or staff corps insignia for officers, and different buttons on dress uniforms.\n\nIn 1974, the current Coast Guard Service Dress Blue \"Bravo\" uniform was introduced for wear by both officers and enlisted personnel; the transition was completed during 1974. The uniform consists of a blue four-pocket single breasted jacket and trousers, a light-blue button-up shirt with a pointed collar, two front button-flap pockets, and shoulder loops, along with a tie of the same shade as the jacket are worn with the uniform.

Additionally, a sword may be prescribed for officers, and white gloves may be required. A white belt may be worn for [[honor guard]]s.\n\nThe Tropical Blue uniform, worn in warm weather, omits the jacket and tie, and features a short-sleeved, light blue shirt (identical to that worn by the [[U.S. Air Force]]) with rank insignia on shoulder boards for officers, and pin-on collar insignia for petty officers. The Tropical Blue uniform may be worn year-round for general office wear and for visits between commands. It may be worn in lieu of the SDB uniform, but not to functions where civilian dress is coat and tie.<ref name=\"UniformRegs\" />\n\nDespite the transition to distinctive \"Bender's blues\" uniforms in the 1970s, some Navy-style dress uniforms were retained. The Service Dress White and Full Dress White \"choker\" uniforms for officers are identical to those worn by U.S. Navy officers (aside from service-specific buttons, insignia and sword design). These are typically used for formal parade and [[Change of command|change-of-command]] ceremonies. For similar occasions the enlisted members wear Tropical Blue, Service Dress Blue or Full Dress Blue. The [[mess dress|dinner dress]] uniforms worn for formal (black tie) evening ceremonies are also identical to those of the Navy, aside from Coast Guard-specific insignia. As in the Navy, these uniforms are required for officers, but optional for enlisted members. Due to the expense of these uniforms and the fact that they are rarely called-for, few junior enlisted members purchase them.\n\n[[File:Members of the U.S. Coast Guard Pipe Band march up Fifth Avenue in the 250th St. Patrick's Day Parade, Manhattan, N.Y., March 17, 2010.jpg|thumb|The U.S. Coast Guard Pipe Band in New York during the 2010 [[Saint Patrick's Day in the United States#New York City|St. Patrick's Day Parade]]]]\n\nThe current working uniform of the Coast Guard is the [[Operational Dress Uniform]] (ODU). The ODU may be worn year-round primarily as a field utility and watchstanding uniform, but may also be worn in an office environment where appropriate. The ODU is similar to the old-style [[Battle Dress Uniform]] previously worn by all branches of the U.S. Armed Forces, both in function and style. However, the ODU is in a solid dark blue with no camouflage pattern and does not have lower pockets on the blouse. The first generation ODU, in service from 2004 to 2012, was worn with the blouse tucked into the trousers. The second generation ODU is worn with the blouse untucked and has black Coast Guard insignia embroidered on the right breast pocket as well as the side pockets of the trousers. The ODU is worn with composite-toed boots in most circumstances, but low-cut brown boat shoes may be prescribed for certain vessel boarding operations. A standard baseball-style ball cap is worn, embroidered in gold block lettering with \"U.S. Coast Guard.\" Units may also additionally authorize ball caps with the unit name embroidered for wear while on the unit. A foul weather parka is the outerwear worn with the ODU. The ODU's success and practicality as a working uniform has led the [[U.S. Public Health Service]] and the [[NOAA Corps]] to adopt ODU variants as standard working uniforms. Some Navy personnel also advocated adoption of the ODU as a standard shipboard uniform for the Navy, rather than the unpopular [[Navy Working Uniform]] Type I.\n\nCoast Guard personnel serving in expeditionary combat units such as [[Port Security Unit]]s or Law Enforcement Detachments, and Coast Guard personnel deployed overseas (e.g. [[PATFORSWA]]) wear the [[Navy Working Uniform]] Type III with distinctive Coast Guard insignia, and generally follow Navy Uniform Regulations.\n\n[[File:USCG Cadet Fall Parade Uniform.jpg|thumb|left|Coast Guard cadets wearing Full Dress Blue (B) uniforms]]\nAll Coast Guardsmen wear the [[Peaked cap|combination cap]] with all uniforms except the ODU and CUU.

Coast Guard reservists possess the same training and qualifications as their active duty counterparts, and as such, can be found augmenting active duty Coast Guard units every day.\n\nDuring the [[Vietnam War]] and shortly thereafter, the Coast Guard considered abandoning the reserve program, but the force was instead reoriented into force augmentation, where its principal focus was not just reserve operations, but to add to the readiness and mission execution of every-day active duty personnel.\n\nSince 11 September 2001, reservists have been activated and served on tours of active duty, to include deployments to the [[Persian Gulf]] and also as parts of Department of Defense combatant commands such as the [[United States Northern Command|U.S. Northern]] and [[United States Central Command|Central]] Commands. Coast Guard Port Security Units are entirely staffed with reservists, except for five to seven active duty personnel. Additionally, most of the staffing the Coast Guard provides to the Navy Expeditionary Combat Command are reservists.\n\nThe Reserve is managed by the Assistant Commandant for Reserve, Rear Admiral Todd C.

Some may consider it as the first independent cultural initiative in China ever since [[Communist Party of China|Chinese Communist Party]] took over mainland China in 1949. However, China shut herself up in isolation until recent times when she opened to [[Western philosophy|western philosophy and technological influences]]. When [[1989 Tiananmen Square protests|Tiananmen Square Massacre]] took place in 1989 resulting in numerous students being killed for asking for [[democracy]] in China, China's political climate was subject to abrupt change which seemed to have brought to an end all forms or expressions of Chinese cultural [[Chinese culture|fever]]. Nevertheless, Chinese cultural fever sparks again in the 21st Asian Century when China continually makes huge progress in economic and technological advances both locally as well as internationally. Everywhere you go, you can see [[Chinese influence on Japanese culture|Chinese influence]] all over the world: politically, economically, culturally, technologically and environmentally. People from all over the world come to learn [[Chinese language|Chinese]], eat Chinese meals, drink [[Chinese tea culture|Chinese tea]], and study at [[Chinese universities|Chinese Universities]] for profound cultural exchanges.\n\n'''Chinese Political Climate After Tiananmen Square:'''\n\nAfter the [[1989 Tiananmen Square protests|massacre of protesting students at Tiananmen Square in 1989]], the Chinese political climate changed drastically. China began to control its citizens more harshly and consequences became more dictatorial. They began to limit citizens criticism against the government and silence the people. The Democracy Wall, a way for citizens to express their opinions about Congress, was demolished and citizens still have little say in government power. Although free speech was never given to the citizens, they opened up to involve themselves more with international affairs, spreading their culture globally.\n\n'''Chinese Cultural Fever in the 21st Century America:'''\n\nChinese culture has affected our society today on a global scale.

Some may consider it as the first independent cultural initiative in China ever since [[Communist Party of China|Chinese Communist Party]] took over mainland China in 1949. However, China shut herself up in isolation until recent times when she opened to [[Western philosophy|western philosophy and technological influences]]. When [[1989 Tiananmen Square protests|Tiananmen Square Massacre]] took place in 1989 resulting in numerous students being killed for asking for [[democracy]] in China, China's political climate was subject to abrupt change which seemed to have brought to an end all forms or expressions of Chinese cultural [[Chinese culture|fever]]. Nevertheless, Chinese cultural fever sparks again in the 21st Asian Century when China continually makes huge progress in economic and technological advances both locally as well as internationally. Everywhere you go, you can see [[Chinese influence on Japanese culture|Chinese influence]] all over the world: politically, economically, culturally, technologically and environmentally. People from all over the world come to learn [[Chinese language|Chinese]], eat Chinese meals, drink [[Chinese tea culture|Chinese tea]], and study at [[Chinese universities|Chinese Universities]] for profound cultural exchanges.\n\n'''Chinese Political Climate After Tiananmen Square:'''\n\nAfter the [[1989 Tiananmen Square protests|massacre of protesting students at Tiananmen Square in 1989]], the Chinese political climate changed drastically. China began to control its citizens more harshly and consequences became more dictatorial. They began to limit citizens criticism against the government and silence the people. The Democracy Wall, a way for citizens to express their opinions about Congress, was demolished and citizens still have little say in government power. Although free speech was never given to the citizens, they opened up to involve themselves more with international affairs, spreading their culture globally.\n\n'''Chinese Cultural Fever in the 21\u2019 st Century America:'''\n\nChinese culture has affected our society today on a global scale.
