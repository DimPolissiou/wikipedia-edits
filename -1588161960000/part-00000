{"title_page": "List of American federal politicians convicted of crimes", "text_new": "{{short description|Wikimedia list article}}\nThis list consists of American [[politicians]] convicted of crimes either committed or prosecuted while holding office in the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]]. It includes politicians who were convicted or pleaded guilty in a court of law; and does not include politicians involved in unprosecuted scandals (which may or may not have been illegal in nature), or politicians who have only been arrested or indicted. The list also does not include crimes that occur outside the politician's tenure unless they specifically stem from acts while they were in office.  It does not include convictions which were vacated (e.g. [[Ted Stevens]] (R)).\n\nAlthough the convicted politicians are arranged by presidential terms in chronological order, many of the crimes have little or no connection to who is president. Since the passage of [[Twentieth Amendment to the United States Constitution|20th Amendment]] on January 23, 1933, presidential terms have begun on January 20 of the year following the presidential election; prior to that, they began on March 4.\n\n==1777\u20131897==\n*[[Matthew Lyon]] ([[Democratic-Republican Party|DR]]-KY).

[[bacteria]] and [[archea]] make [[Vitamin B12|cobalamin]], vitamin B<sub>12</sub>. Many steps are involved in converting [[aminolevulinic acid]] via [[uroporphyrinogen III]] and adenosylcobyric acid to the final forms in which it is used by [[enzymes]] in both the producing organisms and other species, including humans who acquire it through their diet.\n==Cobalamin==\n{{Main|Vitamin B12|l1=Vitamin B<sub>12</sub>}}\nCobalamin (vitamin B<sub>12</sub>) is the largest and most structurally complex [[vitamin]]. It consists of a modified [[tetrapyrrole]], a [[corrin]], with a centrally [[chelated]] [[cobalt]] and is usually found in one of two biologically active forms: [[methylcobalamin]] and [[adenosylcobalamin]]. Most [[prokaryotes]], as well as animals, have cobalamin-dependent enzymes that use it as a [[cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactor]], whereas [[plants]] and [[fungus|fungi]] do not use it. In [[bacteria]] and [[archaea]], these enzymes include [[methionine synthase]], [[ribonucleotide reductase]], glutamate and [[methylmalonyl-CoA mutase]]s, [[ethanolamine ammonia-lyase]], and [[diol]] [[dehydratase]].<ref name=\"pmid12869542\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1074/jbc.M305837200 |doi-access = free |title=Comparative Genomics of the Vitamin B12 Metabolism and Regulation in Prokaryotes |year=2003 |last1=Rodionov |first1=Dmitry A. |last2=Vitreschak |first2=Alexey G. |last3=Mironov |first3=Andrey A. |last4=Gelfand |first4=Mikhail S. |journal=Journal of Biological Chemistry |volume=278 |issue=42 |pages=41148\u201341159 |pmid=12869542 }}</ref> In certain mammals, cobalamin is obtained through the diet, and is required for methionine synthase and [[methylmalonyl-CoA mutase]].<ref name=\"pmid17163662\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1021/cb6001174   |title=B12 Trafficking in Mammals: A Case for Coenzyme Escort Service |year=2006 |last1=Banerjee |first1=Ruma |journal=ACS Chemical Biology |volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=149\u2013159 |pmid=17163662 }}</ref> In humans, it plays essential roles in [[folate]] metabolism and in the synthesis of the [[citric acid cycle]] intermediate, [[succinyl-CoA]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/vitamins/vitamin-B12|title=Vitamin B12 |publisher=Micronutrient Information Center, Linus Pauling Institute, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR|date=4 June 2015 |accessdate=20 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Overview of cobalamin biosynthesis==\nThere are at least two distinct cobalamin biosynthetic pathways in [[bacterium|bacteria]]:<ref name=\"pmid11153269\">{{cite book |doi=10.1016/s0083-6729(01)61009-4 |chapter=Multiple biosynthetic pathways for vitamin B12: Variations on a central theme |title=Cofactor Biosynthesis |series=Vitamins & Hormones |year=2001 |last1=Roessner |first1=Charles A. |last2=Santander |first2=Patricio J. |last3=Scott |first3=A.Ian |volume=61 |pages=267\u2013297 |pmid=11153269 |isbn=9780127098616 }}</ref>\n{|\n|[[File:Biosynthetic pathways to Vitamin B12.jpg|thumb |left|Biosynthetic pathways to Vitamin B12 from aminolevulinic acid (ALA) in bacteria and archaea]]\n|[[File:Vitamin B12.svg|thumb|upright=2|Vitamin B12 (as cyano cobalamin) and its parent cobyric acid]]\n|}\n*[[Aerobic organism|Aerobic]] pathway that requires [[oxygen]] and in which cobalt is inserted late in the pathway;<ref name=\"pmid16042605\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1042/BST0330815  |title=Aerobic synthesis of vitamin B12: Ring contraction and cobalt chelation |year=2005 |last1=Heldt |first1=D. |last2=Lawrence |first2=A.D. |last3=Lindenmeyer |first3=M. |last4=Deery |first4=E. |last5=Heathcote |first5=P. |last6=Rigby |first6=S.E. |last7=Warren |first7=M.J. |journal=Biochemical Society Transactions |volume=33 |issue=4 |pages=815\u2013819 |pmid=16042605 |url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/068c6dc246314fffbb8137925911c32230d7b9c0 }}</ref><ref name=\"aerobic pathway\" >{{cite web |url=https://biocyc.org/META/NEW-IMAGE?type=PATHWAY&object=P381-PWY |title=Pathway: adenosylcobalamin biosynthesis II (aerobic) |author=R.

[[bacteria]] and [[archea]] make [[Vitamin B12|cobalamin]], vitamin B<sub>12</sub>. Many steps are involved in converting [[aminolevulinic acid]] via [[uroporphyrinogen III]] and adenosylcobyric acid to the final forms in which it is used by [[enzymes]] in both the producing organisms and other species, including humans who acquire it through their diet.\n==Cobalamin==\n{{Main|Vitamin B12|l1=Vitamin B<sub>12</sub>}}\nCobalamin (vitamin B<sub>12</sub>) is the largest and most structurally complex [[vitamin]]. It consists of a modified [[tetrapyrrole]], a [[corrin]], with a centrally [[chelated]] [[cobalt]] and is usually found in one of two biologically active forms: [[methylcobalamin]] and [[adenosylcobalamin]]. Most [[prokaryotes]], as well as animals, have cobalamin-dependent enzymes that use it as a [[cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactor]], whereas [[plants]] and [[fungus|fungi]] do not use it. In [[bacteria]] and [[archaea]], these enzymes include [[methionine synthase]], [[ribonucleotide reductase]], glutamate and [[methylmalonyl-CoA mutase]]s, [[ethanolamine ammonia-lyase]], and [[diol]] [[dehydratase]].<ref name=\"pmid12869542\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1074/jbc.M305837200 |doi-access = free |title=Comparative Genomics of the Vitamin B12 Metabolism and Regulation in Prokaryotes |year=2003 |last1=Rodionov |first1=Dmitry A. |last2=Vitreschak |first2=Alexey G. |last3=Mironov |first3=Andrey A. |last4=Gelfand |first4=Mikhail S. |journal=Journal of Biological Chemistry |volume=278 |issue=42 |pages=41148\u201341159 |pmid=12869542 }}</ref> In certain mammals, cobalamin is obtained through the diet, and is required for methionine synthase and [[methylmalonyl-CoA mutase]].<ref name=\"pmid17163662\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1021/cb6001174   |title=B12 Trafficking in Mammals: A Case for Coenzyme Escort Service |year=2006 |last1=Banerjee |first1=Ruma |journal=ACS Chemical Biology |volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=149\u2013159 |pmid=17163662 }}</ref> In humans, it plays essential roles in [[folate]] metabolism and in the synthesis of the [[citric acid cycle]] intermediate, [[succinyl-CoA]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/vitamins/vitamin-B12|title=Vitamin B12 |publisher=Micronutrient Information Center, Linus Pauling Institute, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR|date=4 June 2015 |accessdate=20 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Overview of cobalamin biosynthesis==\nThere are at least two distinct cobalamin biosynthetic pathways in [[bacterium|bacteria]]:<ref name=\"pmid11153269\">{{cite book |doi=10.1016/s0083-6729(01)61009-4 |chapter=Multiple biosynthetic pathways for vitamin B12: Variations on a central theme |title=Cofactor Biosynthesis |series=Vitamins & Hormones |year=2001 |last1=Roessner |first1=Charles A. |last2=Santander |first2=Patricio J. |last3=Scott |first3=A.Ian |volume=61 |pages=267\u2013297 |pmid=11153269 |isbn=9780127098616 }}</ref>\n{|\n|[[File:Biosynthetic pathways to Vitamin B12.jpg|thumb |left|Biosynthetic pathways to Vitamin B12 from aminolevulinic acid (ALA) in bacteria and archaea]]\n|[[File:Vitamin B12.svg|thumb|upright=2|Vitamin B12 (as cyano cobalamin) and its parent cobyric acid]]\n|}\n*[[Aerobic organism|Aerobic]] pathway that requires [[oxygen]] and in which cobalt is inserted late in the pathway;<ref name=\"pmid16042605\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1042/BST0330815  |title=Aerobic synthesis of vitamin B12: Ring contraction and cobalt chelation |year=2005 |last1=Heldt |first1=D. |last2=Lawrence |first2=A.D. |last3=Lindenmeyer |first3=M. |last4=Deery |first4=E. |last5=Heathcote |first5=P. |last6=Rigby |first6=S.E. |last7=Warren |first7=M.J. |journal=Biochemical Society Transactions |volume=33 |issue=4 |pages=815\u2013819 |pmid=16042605 |url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/068c6dc246314fffbb8137925911c32230d7b9c0 }}</ref><ref name=\"aerobic pathway\" >{{cite web |url=https://biocyc.org/META/NEW-IMAGE?type=PATHWAY&object=P381-PWY |title=Pathway: adenosylcobalamin biosynthesis II (aerobic) |author=R.

People used to suffer because there is no access of water now it has been resolved and people don't have to suffer anymore but there is few access of Lavotory and toilets for the people who can not afford to construct toilets then they have no other options besides deflating feces on the street. \n\nMany labourers and daily wagers immigrated from village to earn and hoping to have a better life in this dream of city. \n\nHomes are very small because of huge population and small area the rents and the homes aren't that expensive compares to any other area of Mumbai.Small chawl(Narrow lanes) and chaos between people fight over small issues. Most of the residents have their own house they construct it well & build three floor room and give it on a rent. \n\nNot only clothing businesses are thriving but there are numerous restaurants have started food businesses are also thriving but big brands don't see govandi as a potential area because people here enjoy street foods and fried rice in regular fast food restaurants. \n\nThere are many other businesses are starting like cake shops and they are catching the immense growth one of the best cake shops  is BAKE MY CAKE after opening of this shop there are many other cake shops have opened by other people they see as a potential. \n\nSame happened with clothing and apperal businesses few years back there were only three to four shops on road no 3 but others see the potential and profitable business and start opening their own shops now the whole street is filled with boutique. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mankhurd_Shivaji_Nagar_(Vidhan_Sabha_constituency)<nowiki/>{{Mumbai metropolitan area}}https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deonar\n[[Category:Cities and towns in Mumbai Suburban district]]\n", "name_user": "Arjayay", "label": "safe", "comment": "Rv unsourced = PoV additions", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Govandi"}

Hitler took this title after the death of [[Paul von Hindenburg]], who had been serving as President. He was afterwards both head of state and [[head of government]], with the full official title of ''F\u00fchrer und Reichskanzler des deutschen Volkes'' (\"F\u00fchrer and Reich Chancellor of the German People\").{{sfn|Shirer|1960|pp=226\u2013227}}{{sfn|Overy|2005|p=63}}}} During his dictatorship from 1933 to 1945, he initiated [[European theatre of World War II|World War II in Europe]] by [[invasion of Poland|invading Poland]] on 1 September 1939. He was closely involved in military operations throughout the war and was central to the perpetration of [[the Holocaust]].\n\nHitler was born in Austria\u2014then part of [[Austria-Hungary]]\u2014and was raised near [[Linz]]. He moved to Germany in 1913 and was decorated during his [[Military career of Adolf Hitler|service in the German Army]] in [[World War I]]. In 1919, he joined the [[German Workers' Party]] (DAP), the precursor of the NSDAP, and was appointed leader of the NSDAP in 1921. In 1923, he attempted to seize power in [[Beer Hall Putsch|a failed coup in Munich]] and was imprisoned. In jail, he dictated the first volume of his autobiography and political manifesto ''[[Mein Kampf]]'' (\"My Struggle\"). After his release in 1924, Hitler gained popular support by attacking the [[Treaty of Versailles]] and promoting [[Pan-Germanism]], [[anti-semitism]] and [[anti-communism]] with [[Charismatic authority|charismatic]] oratory and [[Nazi propaganda]]. He frequently denounced international capitalism and communism as part of a [[Antisemitic canard|Jewish conspiracy]].\n\nBy November 1932, the Nazi Party had the most seats in the German [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]] but did not have a majority. As a result, no party was able to form a majority parliamentary coalition in support of a candidate for chancellor. Former chancellor [[Franz von Papen]] and other conservative leaders persuaded President [[Paul von Hindenburg]] to appoint Hitler as chancellor on 30 January 1933. Shortly after, the Reichstag passed the [[Enabling Act of 1933]] which began the process of transforming the [[Weimar Republic]] into [[Nazi Germany]], a [[One-party state|one-party]] dictatorship based on the [[totalitarian]] and [[autocratic]] ideology of [[National Socialism]]. Hitler aimed to eliminate Jews from Germany and establish a [[New Order (Nazism)|New Order]] to counter what he saw as the injustice of the post-World War I international order dominated by Britain and France. His first six years in power resulted in rapid economic recovery from the [[Great Depression]], the abrogation of restrictions imposed on Germany after World War I, and the annexation of territories inhabited by millions of [[ethnic Germans]], which gave him significant popular support.\n\nHitler sought ''[[Lebensraum]]'' (\"living space\") for the German people in Eastern Europe, and his aggressive foreign policy is considered the primary cause of World War II in Europe. He directed large-scale rearmament and, on 1 September 1939, invaded Poland, resulting in Britain and France [[British and French declaration of war on Germany|declaring war on Germany]]. In June 1941, Hitler ordered an [[Operation Barbarossa|invasion of the Soviet Union]]. By the end of 1941, German forces and the European [[Axis powers]] occupied most of Europe and [[North African Campaign|North Africa]]. These gains were gradually reversed after 1941, and in 1945 the [[Allies of World War II|Allied armies]] defeated the German army. On 29 April 1945, he married his longtime lover [[Eva Braun]]. Less than two days later, the couple [[Death of Adolf Hitler|committed suicide]] to avoid capture by the Soviet [[Red Army]]. Their corpses were burned.\n\nUnder Hitler's leadership and [[Nazism and race|racially motivated ideology]], the Nazi regime was responsible for the [[Holocaust victims|genocide of about 6 million Jews and millions of other victims]] whom he and his followers deemed ''[[Untermensch]]en'' (subhumans) or socially undesirable. Hitler and the Nazi regime were also responsible for the killing of an estimated 19.3&nbsp;million civilians and prisoners of war. In addition, 28.7&nbsp;million soldiers and civilians died as a result of military action in the European theatre. The number of [[World War II casualties|civilians killed]] during World War II was unprecedented in warfare, and the casualties constitute the [[List of wars by death toll|deadliest conflict in history]].\n\nHitler's actions and Nazi ideology are almost universally regarded as gravely immoral. According to [[Ian Kershaw]], \"Never in history has such ruination\u2014physical and moral\u2014been associated with the name of one man.\"{{sfn|Kershaw|2000b|p=841}}\n\n== Ancestry ==\n{{Main|Hitler family}}\nHitler's father [[Alois Hitler|Alois Hitler Sr.]] (1837\u20131903) was the [[illegitimate]] child of [[Maria Anna Schicklgruber]].{{sfn|Bullock|1999|p=24}} The baptismal register did not show the name of his father, and Alois initially bore his mother's surname ''Schicklgruber''. In 1842, [[Johann Georg Hiedler]] married Alois's mother Maria Anna. Alois was brought up in the family of Hiedler's brother, [[Johann Nepomuk Hiedler]].{{sfn|Maser|1973|p=4}} In 1876, Alois was legitimated and the baptismal register changed by a priest to register Johann Georg Hiedler as Alois's father (recorded as \"Georg Hitler\").{{sfn|Maser|1973|p=15}}{{sfn|Kershaw|1999|p=5}} Alois then assumed the surname \"Hitler\",{{sfn|Kershaw|1999|p=5}} also spelled ''Hiedler'', ''H\u00fcttler'', or ''Huettler''. The name is probably based on \"one who lives in a hut\" (German ''H\u00fctte'' for \"hut\").{{sfn|Jetzinger|1976|p=32}}\n\nNazi official [[Hans Frank]] suggested that Alois' mother had been employed as a housekeeper by a [[Jewish]] family in [[Graz]], and that the family's 19-year-old son Leopold Frankenberger had fathered Alois.{{sfn|Rosenbaum|1999|p=21}} No Frankenberger was registered in Graz during that period, and no record has been produced of Leopold Frankenberger's existence,{{sfn|Hamann|2010|p=50}} so historians dismiss the claim that Alois' father was Jewish.{{sfn|Toland|1992|pp=246\u2013247}}{{sfn|Kershaw|1999|pp=8\u20139}}\n\n== Early years ==\n=== Childhood and education ===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1989-0322-506, Adolf Hitler, Kinderbild retouched.jpg|upright|thumb|left|Adolf Hitler as an infant (c. 1889\u201390)]]\nAdolf Hitler was born on 20 April 1889 in [[Braunau am Inn]], a town in [[Austria-Hungary]] (in present-day Austria), close to the border with the [[German Empire]].{{sfn|House of Responsibility}} He was [[Infant baptism|christened]] as \"'''Adolphus Hitler'''\".{{sfn|Giblin|2002|p=4}} He was the fourth of six children born to Alois Hitler and his third wife, [[Klara Hitler|Klara P\u00f6lzl]].

Hitler attended ''[[Volksschule]]'' (a state-owned primary school) in nearby [[Fischlham]].{{sfn|Kubizek|2006|p=92}}{{sfn|Hitler|1999|p=6}}\n\nThe move to Hafeld coincided with the onset of intense father-son conflicts caused by Hitler's refusal to conform to the strict discipline of his school.{{sfn|Fromm|1977|pp=493\u2013498}} His father beat him, although his mother tried to protect him.{{sfn|Diver|2005}} Alois Hitler's farming efforts at Hafeld ended in failure, and in 1897 the family moved to Lambach. The eight-year-old Hitler took singing lessons, sang in the church choir, and even considered becoming a priest.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|pp=10\u201311}} In 1898 the family returned permanently to Leonding. Hitler was deeply affected by the death of his younger brother Edmund, who died in 1900 from [[measles]].

At a DAP meeting on 12 September 1919, Party Chairman [[Anton Drexler]] was impressed with Hitler's oratorical skills. He gave him a copy of his pamphlet ''My Political Awakening'', which contained anti-Semitic, nationalist, [[anti-capitalist]], and anti-Marxist ideas.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=82}} On the orders of his army superiors, Hitler applied to join the party,{{sfn|Evans|2003|p=170}} and within a week was accepted as party member 555 (the party began counting membership at 500 to give the impression they were a much larger party).{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=75, 76}}{{sfn|Mitcham|1996|p=67}}\n\nAround this time, Hitler made his earliest known recorded statement about the Jews in a letter (now known as the [[Gemlich letter]]) dated 16 September 1919 to Adolf Gemlich about the [[Jewish question]]. In the letter, Hitler argues that the aim of the government \"must unshakably be the removal of the Jews altogether\".{{sfn|Kershaw|1999|pp=125\u2013126}}\n\nAt the DAP, Hitler met [[Dietrich Eckart]], one of the party's founders and a member of the occult [[Thule Society]].{{sfn|Fest|1970|p=21}} Eckart became Hitler's mentor, exchanging ideas with him and introducing him to a wide range of Munich society.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=94, 95, 100}} To increase its appeal, the DAP changed its name to the ''Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei'' ([[National Socialist German Workers Party]]; NSDAP).{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=87}} Hitler designed the party's banner of a [[swastika]] in a white circle on a red background.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=88}}\n\nHitler was discharged from the army on 31 March 1920 and began working full-time for the NSDAP.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=93}} The party headquarters was in Munich, a hotbed of anti-government German nationalists determined to crush Marxism and undermine the [[Weimar Republic]].{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=81}} In February 1921\u2014already highly effective at [[crowd manipulation]]\u2014he spoke to a crowd of over 6,000.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=89}} To publicise the meeting, two truckloads of party supporters drove around Munich waving swastika flags and distributing leaflets.

Members of its executive committee wanted to merge with the rival [[German Socialist Party]] (DSP).{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=100, 101}} Hitler returned to Munich on 11 July and angrily tendered his resignation. The committee members realised that the resignation of their leading public figure and speaker would mean the end of the party.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=102}} Hitler announced he would rejoin on the condition that he would replace Drexler as party chairman, and that the party headquarters would remain in Munich.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=103}} The committee agreed, and he rejoined the party on 26 July as member 3,680. Hitler continued to face some opposition within the NSDAP: Opponents of Hitler in the leadership had [[Hermann Esser]] expelled from the party, and they printed 3,000 copies of a pamphlet attacking Hitler as a traitor to the party.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=103}}{{efn|name=libel suit}} In the following days, Hitler spoke to several packed houses and defended himself and Esser, to thunderous applause.

R\u00f6hm became head of the Nazis' paramilitary organisation, the ''[[Sturmabteilung]]'' (SA, \"Stormtroopers\"), which protected meetings and attacked political opponents. A critical influence on Hitler's thinking during this period was the ''[[Aufbau Vereinigung]]'',{{sfn|Kellogg|2005|p=275}} a conspiratorial group of [[White \u00e9migr\u00e9|White Russian]] exiles and early National Socialists. The group, financed with funds channelled from wealthy industrialists, introduced Hitler to the idea of a Jewish conspiracy, linking international finance with [[Bolshevism]].{{sfn|Kellogg|2005|p=203}}\n\nThe programme of the NSDAP, known colloquially as the \"Nazi Party\", was laid out in their [[National Socialist Program|25-point programme]] on 24 February 1920. This did not represent a coherent ideology, but was a conglomeration of received ideas which had currency in the ''[[v\u00f6lkisch]]'' [[Pan-Germanism|Pan-Germanic]] movement, such as [[ultranationalism]], opposition to the [[Treaty of Versailles]], distrust of [[capitalism]], as well as some [[socialist]] ideas. For Hitler, though, the most important aspect of it was its strong [[anti-Semitic]] stance.

The NSDAP used [[Italian Fascism]] as a model for their appearance and policies. Hitler wanted to emulate [[Benito Mussolini]]'s \"[[March on Rome]]\" of 1922 by staging his own coup in Bavaria, to be followed by a challenge to the government in Berlin. Hitler and Ludendorff sought the support of ''Staatskommissar'' (state commissioner) [[Gustav Ritter von Kahr]], Bavaria's ''de facto'' ruler. However, Kahr, along with Police Chief [[Hans Ritter von Seisser]] and Reichswehr General [[Otto von Lossow]], wanted to install a nationalist dictatorship without Hitler.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=126}}\n\nOn 8 November 1923, Hitler and the SA stormed a public meeting of 3,000 people organised by Kahr in the [[B\u00fcrgerbr\u00e4ukeller]], a beer hall in Munich. Interrupting Kahr's speech, he announced that the national revolution had begun and declared the formation of a new government with Ludendorff.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=128}} Retiring to a back room, Hitler, with handgun drawn, demanded and got the support of Kahr, Seisser, and Lossow.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=128}} Hitler's forces initially succeeded in occupying the local Reichswehr and police headquarters, but Kahr and his cohorts quickly withdrew their support. Neither the army, nor the state police, joined forces with Hitler.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=129}} The next day, Hitler and his followers marched from the beer hall to the [[Ministry of War (Kingdom of Bavaria)|Bavarian War Ministry]] to overthrow the Bavarian government, but police dispersed them.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=130\u2013131}} [[List of Nazis who died in the Beer Hall Putsch|Sixteen NSDAP members]] and four police officers were killed in the failed coup.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|pp=73\u201374}}\n\n[[File:Mein Kampf dust jacket.jpeg|thumb|[[Dust jacket]] of ''[[Mein Kampf]]'' (1926\u201328 edition)]]\nHitler fled to the home of [[Ernst Hanfstaengl]] and by some accounts contemplated suicide.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=132}} He was depressed but calm when arrested on 11 November 1923 for [[high treason]].{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=131}} His trial before the special [[People's Court (Bavaria)|People's Court]] in Munich began in February 1924,{{sfn|Munich Court, 1924}} and [[Alfred Rosenberg]] became temporary leader of the NSDAP. On 1 April, Hitler was sentenced to five years' imprisonment at [[Landsberg Prison]].{{sfn|Fulda|2009|pp=68\u201369}} There, he received friendly treatment from the guards, and was allowed mail from supporters and regular visits by party comrades. Pardoned by the Bavarian Supreme Court, he was released from jail on 20 December 1924, against the state prosecutor's objections.{{sfn|Kershaw|1999|p=239}} Including time on remand, Hitler served just over one year in prison.{{sfn|Bullock|1962|p=121}}\n\nWhile at Landsberg, Hitler dictated most of the first volume of ''Mein Kampf'' (''My Struggle''; originally entitled ''Four and a Half Years of Struggle against Lies, Stupidity, and Cowardice'') at first to his chauffeur, [[Emil Maurice]], and then to his deputy, [[Rudolf Hess]].{{sfn|Bullock|1962|p=121}}{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|page=147}} The book, dedicated to Thule Society member Dietrich Eckart, was an autobiography and exposition of his ideology. The book laid out Hitler's plans for transforming German society into one based on race. Throughout the book, Jews are equated with \"germs\" and presented as the \"international poisoners\" of society. According to Hitler's ideology, the only solution was their extermination. While Hitler did not describe exactly how this was to be accomplished, his \"inherent genocidal thrust is undeniable,\" according to [[Ian Kershaw]].{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=148\u2013150}}\n\nPublished in two volumes in 1925 and 1926, ''Mein Kampf'' sold 228,000 copies between 1925 and 1932. One million copies were sold in 1933, Hitler's first year in office.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|pp=80\u201381}}\n\nShortly before Hitler was eligible for parole, the Bavarian government attempted to have him deported to Austria.{{sfn|Kershaw|1999|p=237}} The Austrian federal chancellor rejected the request on the specious grounds that his service in the German Army made his Austrian citizenship void.{{sfn|Kershaw|1999|p=238}} In response, Hitler formally renounced his Austrian citizenship on 7 April 1925.{{sfn|Kershaw|1999|p=238}}\n\n=== Rebuilding the Nazi Party ===\nAt the time of Hitler's release from prison, politics in Germany had become less combative and the economy had improved, limiting Hitler's opportunities for political agitation. As a result of the failed Beer Hall Putsch, the Nazi Party and its affiliated organisations were banned in Bavaria. In a meeting with the Prime Minister of Bavaria [[Heinrich Held]] on 4 January 1925, Hitler agreed to respect the state's authority and promised that he would seek political power only through the democratic process. The meeting paved the way for the ban on the NSDAP to be lifted on 16 February.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=158, 161, 162}} However, after an inflammatory speech he gave on 27 February, Hitler was barred from public speaking by the Bavarian authorities, a ban that remained in place until 1927.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=162, 166}}{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=129}} To advance his political ambitions in spite of the ban, Hitler appointed [[Gregor Strasser]], [[Otto Strasser]] and [[Joseph Goebbels]] to organise and enlarge the NSDAP in northern Germany. Gregor Strasser steered a more independent political course, emphasising the socialist elements of the party's programme.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=166, 167}}\n\nThe stock market in the United States [[Wall Street Crash of 1929|crashed on 24 October 1929]].

Hitler headed a short-lived coalition government formed by the NSDAP (which had the most seats in the Reichstag) and Hugenberg's party, the [[German National People's Party]] (DNVP). On 30 January 1933, the new cabinet was sworn in during a brief ceremony in Hindenburg's office. The NSDAP gained three posts: Hitler was named chancellor, [[Wilhelm Frick]] Minister of the Interior, and Hermann G\u00f6ring Minister of the Interior for Prussia.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=184}} Hitler had insisted on the ministerial positions as a way to gain control over the police in much of Germany.{{sfn|Evans|2003|p=307}}\n\n=== Reichstag fire and March elections ===\nAs chancellor, Hitler worked against attempts by the NSDAP's opponents to build a majority government. Because of the political stalemate, he asked Hindenburg to again dissolve the Reichstag, and elections were scheduled for early March. On 27 February 1933, the [[Reichstag fire|Reichstag building was set on fire]].

On election day, 6 March 1933, the NSDAP's share of the vote increased to 43.9 per cent, and the party acquired the largest number of seats in parliament.

The Act\u2014officially titled the ''Gesetz zur Behebung der Not von Volk und Reich'' (\"Law to Remedy the Distress of People and Reich\")\u2014gave Hitler's cabinet the power to enact laws without the consent of the Reichstag for four years. These laws could (with certain exceptions) deviate from the constitution.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=198}} Since it would affect the constitution, the Enabling Act required a two-thirds majority to pass. Leaving nothing to chance, the Nazis used the provisions of the Reichstag Fire Decree to arrest all 81 Communist deputies (in spite of their virulent campaign against the party, the Nazis had allowed the KPD to contest the election){{sfn|Evans|2003|p=335}} and prevent several Social Democrats from attending.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=196}}\n\nOn 23 March 1933, the Reichstag assembled at the [[Kroll Opera House]] under turbulent circumstances.

After Hitler verbally promised party leader [[Ludwig Kaas]] that Hindenburg would retain his power of veto, Kaas announced the Centre Party would support the Enabling Act. The Act passed by a vote of 441\u201384, with all parties except the Social Democrats voting in favour.

please don't add \"Austrian-born\" or similar without discussing on talk first--> German politician and leader of the [[Nazi Party]] (''Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei''; NSDAP). He [[Adolf Hitler's rise to power|rose to power]] as the [[chancellor of Germany]] in 1933 and then as ''[[F\u00fchrer]]'' in 1934.{{efn|The position of ''F\u00fchrer'' (\"Leader\") replaced the position of \"President\", which was the [[head of state]] for the [[Weimar Republic]]. Hitler took this title after the death of [[Paul von Hindenburg]], who had been serving as President. He was afterwards both head of state and [[head of government]], with the full official title of ''F\u00fchrer und Reichskanzler des deutschen Volkes'' (\"F\u00fchrer and Reich Chancellor of the German People\").{{sfn|Shirer|1960|pp=226\u2013227}}{{sfn|Overy|2005|p=63}}}} During his dictatorship from 1933 to 1945, he initiated [[European theatre of World War II|World War II in Europe]] by [[invasion of Poland|invading Poland]] on 1 September 1939. He was closely involved in military operations throughout the war and was central to the perpetration of [[the Holocaust]].\n\nHitler was born in Austria\u2014then part of [[Austria-Hungary]]\u2014and was raised near [[Linz]]. He moved to Germany in 1913 and was decorated during his [[Military career of Adolf Hitler|service in the German Army]] in [[World War I]]. In 1919, he joined the [[German Workers' Party]] (DAP), the precursor of the NSDAP, and was appointed leader of the NSDAP in 1921. In 1923, he attempted to seize power in [[Beer Hall Putsch|a failed coup in Munich]] and was imprisoned. In jail, he dictated the first volume of his autobiography and political manifesto ''[[Mein Kampf]]'' (\"My Struggle\"). After his release in 1924, Hitler gained popular support by attacking the [[Treaty of Versailles]] and promoting [[Pan-Germanism]], [[anti-semitism]] and [[anti-communism]] with [[Charismatic authority|charismatic]] oratory and [[Nazi propaganda]]. He frequently denounced international capitalism and communism as part of a [[Antisemitic canard|Jewish conspiracy]].\n\nBy November 1932, the Nazi Party had the most seats in the German [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]] but did not have a majority. As a result, no party was able to form a majority parliamentary coalition in support of a candidate for chancellor. Former chancellor [[Franz von Papen]] and other conservative leaders persuaded President [[Paul von Hindenburg]] to appoint Hitler as chancellor on 30 January 1933. Shortly after, the Reichstag passed the [[Enabling Act of 1933]] which began the process of transforming the [[Weimar Republic]] into [[Nazi Germany]], a [[One-party state|one-party]] dictatorship based on the [[totalitarian]] and [[autocratic]] ideology of [[National Socialism]]. Hitler aimed to eliminate Jews from Germany and establish a [[New Order (Nazism)|New Order]] to counter what he saw as the injustice of the post-World War I international order dominated by Britain and France. His first six years in power resulted in rapid economic recovery from the [[Great Depression]], the abrogation of restrictions imposed on Germany after World War I, and the annexation of territories inhabited by millions of [[ethnic Germans]], which gave him significant popular support.\n\nHitler sought ''[[Lebensraum]]'' (\"living space\") for the German people in Eastern Europe, and his aggressive foreign policy is considered the primary cause of World War II in Europe. He directed large-scale rearmament and, on 1 September 1939, invaded Poland, resulting in Britain and France [[British and French declaration of war on Germany|declaring war on Germany]]. In June 1941, Hitler ordered an [[Operation Barbarossa|invasion of the Soviet Union]]. By the end of 1941, German forces and the European [[Axis powers]] occupied most of Europe and [[North African Campaign|North Africa]]. These gains were gradually reversed after 1941, and in 1945 the [[Allies of World War II|Allied armies]] defeated the German army. On 29 April 1945, he married his longtime lover [[Eva Braun]]. Less than two days later, the couple [[Death of Adolf Hitler|committed suicide]] to avoid capture by the Soviet [[Red Army]]. Their corpses were burned. \n\nUnder Hitler's leadership and [[Nazism and race|racially motivated ideology]], the Nazi regime was responsible for the [[Holocaust victims|genocide of about 6 million Jews and millions of other victims]] whom he and his followers deemed ''[[Untermensch]]en'' (subhumans) or socially undesirable. Hitler and the Nazi regime were also responsible for the killing of an estimated 19.3 million civilians and prisoners of war. In addition, 28.7 million soldiers and civilians died as a result of military action in the European theatre. The number of [[World War II casualties|civilians killed]] during World War II was unprecedented in warfare, and the casualties constitute the [[List of wars by death toll|deadliest conflict in history]].\n\nHitler's actions and Nazi ideology are almost universally regarded as gravely immoral. According to [[Ian Kershaw]], \"Never in history has such ruination\u2014physical and moral\u2014been associated with the name of one man.\"{{sfn|Kershaw|2000b|p=841}}\n\n== Ancestry ==\n{{Main|Hitler family}}\nHitler's father [[Alois Hitler|Alois Hitler Sr.]] (1837\u20131903) was the [[illegitimate]] child of [[Maria Anna Schicklgruber]].{{sfn|Bullock|1999|p=24}} The baptismal register did not show the name of his father, and Alois initially bore his mother's surname ''Schicklgruber''. In 1842, [[Johann Georg Hiedler]] married Alois's mother Maria Anna. Alois was brought up in the family of Hiedler's brother, [[Johann Nepomuk Hiedler]].{{sfn|Maser|1973|p=4}} In 1876, Alois was legitimated and the baptismal register changed by a priest to register Johann Georg Hiedler as Alois's father (recorded as \"Georg Hitler\").{{sfn|Maser|1973|p=15}}{{sfn|Kershaw|1999|p=5}} Alois then assumed the surname \"Hitler\",{{sfn|Kershaw|1999|p=5}} also spelled ''Hiedler'', ''H\u00fcttler'', or ''Huettler''. The name is probably based on \"one who lives in a hut\" (German ''H\u00fctte'' for \"hut\").{{sfn|Jetzinger|1976|p=32}}\n\nNazi official [[Hans Frank]] suggested that Alois' mother had been employed as a housekeeper by a [[Jewish]] family in [[Graz]], and that the family's 19-year-old son Leopold Frankenberger had fathered Alois.{{sfn|Rosenbaum|1999|p=21}} No Frankenberger was registered in Graz during that period, and no record has been produced of Leopold Frankenberger's existence,{{sfn|Hamann|2010|p=50}} so historians dismiss the claim that Alois' father was Jewish.{{sfn|Toland|1992|pp=246\u2013247}}{{sfn|Kershaw|1999|pp=8\u20139}}\n\n== Early years ==\n=== Childhood and education ===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1989-0322-506, Adolf Hitler, Kinderbild retouched.jpg|upright|thumb|left|Adolf Hitler as an infant (c. 1889\u201390)]]\nAdolf Hitler was born on 20 April 1889 in [[Braunau am Inn]], a town in [[Austria-Hungary]] (in present-day Austria), close to the border with the [[German Empire]].{{sfn|House of Responsibility}} He was [[Infant baptism|christened]] as \"'''Adolphus Hitler'''\".{{sfn|Giblin|2002|p=4}} He was the fourth of six children born to Alois Hitler and his third wife, [[Klara Hitler|Klara P\u00f6lzl]].

Hitler attended ''[[Volksschule]]'' (a state-owned primary school) in nearby [[Fischlham]].{{sfn|Kubizek|2006|p=92}}{{sfn|Hitler|1999|p=6}}\n\nThe move to Hafeld coincided with the onset of intense father-son conflicts caused by Hitler's refusal to conform to the strict discipline of his school.{{sfn|Fromm|1977|pp=493\u2013498}} His father beat him, although his mother tried to protect him.{{sfn|Diver|2005}} Alois Hitler's farming efforts at Hafeld ended in failure, and in 1897 the family moved to Lambach. The eight-year-old Hitler took singing lessons, sang in the church choir, and even considered becoming a priest.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|pp=10\u201311}} In 1898 the family returned permanently to Leonding. Hitler was deeply affected by the death of his younger brother Edmund, who died in 1900 from [[measles]].

German nationalism had a particularly widespread following in the [[Mariahilf]] district, where Hitler lived.{{sfn|Hamann|2010|pp=243\u2013246}} [[Georg Ritter von Sch\u00f6nerer]] became a major influence on Hitler.{{sfn|Nicholls|2000|pp=236, 237, 274}} He also developed an admiration for [[Martin Luther]].{{sfn|Hamann|2010|p=250}} Hitler read local newspapers such as ''Deutsches Volksblatt'' that fanned prejudice and played on Christian fears of being swamped by an influx of Eastern European Jews.{{sfn|Hamann|2010|pp=341\u2013345}} He read newspapers and pamphlets that published the thoughts of philosophers and theoreticians such as [[Houston Stewart Chamberlain]], [[Charles Darwin]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Gustave Le Bon]] and [[Arthur Schopenhauer]].{{sfn|Hamann|2010|p=233}}\n\nThe origin and development of Hitler's anti-Semitism remains a matter of debate.{{sfn|Kershaw|1999|pp=60\u201367}} His friend, [[August Kubizek]], claimed that Hitler was a \"confirmed anti-Semite\" before he left Linz.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=25}} However, historian Brigitte Hamann describes Kubizek's claim as \"problematical\".{{sfn|Hamann|2010|p=58}} While Hitler states in ''Mein Kampf'' that he first became an anti-Semite in Vienna,{{sfn|Hitler|1999|p=52}} [[Reinhold Hanisch]], who helped him sell his paintings, disagrees.

At a DAP meeting on 12 September 1919, Party Chairman [[Anton Drexler]] was impressed with Hitler's oratorical skills. He gave him a copy of his pamphlet ''My Political Awakening'', which contained anti-Semitic, nationalist, [[anti-capitalist]], and anti-Marxist ideas.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=82}} On the orders of his army superiors, Hitler applied to join the party,{{sfn|Evans|2003|p=170}} and within a week was accepted as party member 555 (the party began counting membership at 500 to give the impression they were a much larger party).{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=75, 76}}{{sfn|Mitcham|1996|p=67}}\n\nAround this time, Hitler made his earliest known recorded statement about the Jews in a letter (now known as the [[Gemlich letter]]) dated 16 September 1919 to Adolf Gemlich about the [[Jewish question]].

R\u00f6hm became head of the Nazis' paramilitary organisation, the ''[[Sturmabteilung]]'' (SA, \"Stormtroopers\"), which protected meetings and attacked political opponents. A critical influence on Hitler's thinking during this period was the ''[[Aufbau Vereinigung]]'',{{sfn|Kellogg|2005|p=275}} a conspiratorial group of [[White \u00e9migr\u00e9|White Russian]] exiles and early National Socialists. The group, financed with funds channelled from wealthy industrialists, introduced Hitler to the idea of a Jewish conspiracy, linking international finance with [[Bolshevism]].{{sfn|Kellogg|2005|p=203}}\n\nThe programme of the NSDAP, known colloquially as the \"Nazi Party\", was laid out in their [[National Socialist Program|25-point programme]] on 24 February 1920. This did not represent a coherent ideology, but was a conglomeration of received ideas which had currency in the ''[[v\u00f6lkisch]]'' [[Pan-Germanism|Pan-Germanic]] movement, such as [[ultranationalism]], opposition to the [[Treaty of Versailles]], distrust of [[capitalism]], as well as some [[socialist]] ideas. For Hitler, though, the most important aspect of it was its strong [[anti-Semitic]] stance.

The NSDAP used [[Italian Fascism]] as a model for their appearance and policies. Hitler wanted to emulate [[Benito Mussolini]]'s \"[[March on Rome]]\" of 1922 by staging his own coup in Bavaria, to be followed by a challenge to the government in Berlin. Hitler and Ludendorff sought the support of ''Staatskommissar'' (state commissioner) [[Gustav Ritter von Kahr]], Bavaria's ''de facto'' ruler. However, Kahr, along with Police Chief [[Hans Ritter von Seisser]] and Reichswehr General [[Otto von Lossow]], wanted to install a nationalist dictatorship without Hitler.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=126}}\n\nOn 8 November 1923, Hitler and the SA stormed a public meeting of 3,000 people organised by Kahr in the [[B\u00fcrgerbr\u00e4ukeller]], a beer hall in Munich. Interrupting Kahr's speech, he announced that the national revolution had begun and declared the formation of a new government with Ludendorff.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=128}} Retiring to a back room, Hitler, with handgun drawn, demanded and got the support of Kahr, Seisser, and Lossow.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=128}} Hitler's forces initially succeeded in occupying the local Reichswehr and police headquarters, but Kahr and his cohorts quickly withdrew their support. Neither the army, nor the state police, joined forces with Hitler.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=129}} The next day, Hitler and his followers marched from the beer hall to the [[Ministry of War (Kingdom of Bavaria)|Bavarian War Ministry]] to overthrow the Bavarian government, but police dispersed them.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=130\u2013131}} [[List of Nazis who died in the Beer Hall Putsch|Sixteen NSDAP members]] and four police officers were killed in the failed coup.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|pp=73\u201374}}\n\n[[File:Mein Kampf dust jacket.jpeg|thumb|[[Dust jacket]] of ''[[Mein Kampf]]'' (1926\u201328 edition)]]\nHitler fled to the home of [[Ernst Hanfstaengl]] and by some accounts contemplated suicide.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=132}} He was depressed but calm when arrested on 11 November 1923 for [[high treason]].{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=131}} His trial before the special [[People's Court (Bavaria)|People's Court]] in Munich began in February 1924,{{sfn|Munich Court, 1924}} and [[Alfred Rosenberg]] became temporary leader of the NSDAP.

The book laid out Hitler's plans for transforming German society into one based on race. Throughout the book, Jews are equated with \"germs\" and presented as the \"international poisoners\" of society. According to Hitler's ideology, the only solution was their extermination. While Hitler did not describe exactly how this was to be accomplished, his \"inherent genocidal thrust is undeniable,\" according to [[Ian Kershaw]].{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=148\u2013150}}\n\nPublished in two volumes in 1925 and 1926, ''Mein Kampf'' sold 228,000 copies between 1925 and 1932. One million copies were sold in 1933, Hitler's first year in office.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|pp=80\u201381}}\n\nShortly before Hitler was eligible for parole, the Bavarian government attempted to have him deported to Austria.{{sfn|Kershaw|1999|p=237}} The Austrian federal chancellor rejected the request on the specious grounds that his service in the German Army made his Austrian citizenship void.{{sfn|Kershaw|1999|p=238}} In response, Hitler formally renounced his Austrian citizenship on 7 April 1925.{{sfn|Kershaw|1999|p=238}}\n\n=== Rebuilding the Nazi Party ===\nAt the time of Hitler's release from prison, politics in Germany had become less combative and the economy had improved, limiting Hitler's opportunities for political agitation. As a result of the failed Beer Hall Putsch, the Nazi Party and its affiliated organisations were banned in Bavaria. In a meeting with the Prime Minister of Bavaria [[Heinrich Held]] on 4 January 1925, Hitler agreed to respect the state's authority and promised that he would seek political power only through the democratic process. The meeting paved the way for the ban on the NSDAP to be lifted on 16 February.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=158, 161, 162}} However, after an inflammatory speech he gave on 27 February, Hitler was barred from public speaking by the Bavarian authorities, a ban that remained in place until 1927.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=162, 166}}{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=129}} To advance his political ambitions in spite of the ban, Hitler appointed [[Gregor Strasser]], [[Otto Strasser]] and [[Joseph Goebbels]] to organise and enlarge the NSDAP in northern Germany.

The Act\u2014officially titled the ''Gesetz zur Behebung der Not von Volk und Reich'' (\"Law to Remedy the Distress of People and Reich\")\u2014gave Hitler's cabinet the power to enact laws without the consent of the Reichstag for four years. These laws could (with certain exceptions) deviate from the constitution.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=198}} Since it would affect the constitution, the Enabling Act required a two-thirds majority to pass.

The Act passed by a vote of 441\u201384, with all parties except the Social Democrats voting in favour.

On 15 September 1935, Hitler presented two laws\u2014known as the [[Nuremberg Laws]]\u2014to the Reichstag. The laws banned sexual relations and marriages between Aryans and Jews and were later extended to include \"Gypsies, Negroes or their bastard offspring\".{{sfn|Gellately|2001|p=216}} The laws stripped all non-Aryans of their German citizenship and forbade the employment of non-Jewish women under the age of 45 in Jewish households.{{sfn|Kershaw|1999|pp=567\u2013568}} Hitler's early [[Nazi eugenics|eugenic]] policies targeted children with physical and developmental disabilities in a programme dubbed [[Child euthanasia in Nazi Germany|Action Brandt]], and he later authorised a [[euthanasia]] programme for adults with serious mental and physical disabilities, now referred to as ''[[Aktion T4]]''.{{sfn|Overy|2005|p=252}}\n\n== Leadership style ==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-B24543, Hauptquartier Heeresgruppe S\u00fcd, Lagebesprechung.jpg|thumb|Hitler during a meeting at the headquarters of [[Army Group South]] in June 1942]]\nHitler ruled the NSDAP [[autocratic]]ally by asserting the ''[[F\u00fchrerprinzip]]'' (leader principle). The principle relied on absolute obedience of all subordinates to their superiors; thus he viewed the government structure as a pyramid, with himself\u2014the [[Leaderism|infallible leader]]\u2014at the apex. Rank in the party was not determined by elections\u2014positions were filled through appointment by those of higher rank, who demanded unquestioning obedience to the will of the leader.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=170, 172, 181}} Hitler's leadership style was to give contradictory orders to his subordinates and to place them into positions where their duties and responsibilities overlapped with those of others, to have \"the stronger one [do] the job\".{{sfn|Speer|1971|p=281}} In this way, Hitler fostered distrust, competition, and infighting among his subordinates to consolidate and maximise his own power. [[Hitler Cabinet|His cabinet]] never met after 1938, and he discouraged his ministers from meeting independently.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2007|p=29}}{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=323}} Hitler typically did not give written orders; instead he communicated verbally, or had them conveyed through his close associate, [[Martin Bormann]].{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=377}} He entrusted Bormann with his paperwork, appointments, and personal finances; Bormann used his position to control the flow of information and access to Hitler.{{sfn|Speer|1971|p=333}}\n\nHitler dominated his country's war effort during World War II to a greater extent than any other national leader. He strengthened his control of the armed forces in 1938, and subsequently made all major decisions regarding Germany's military strategy. His decision to mount a risky series of offensives against Norway, France, and the Low Countries in 1940 against the advice of the military proved successful, though the diplomatic and military strategies he employed in attempts to force the United Kingdom out of the war ended in failure.{{sfn|Overy|2005a|pp=421\u2013425}} Hitler deepened his involvement in the war effort by appointing himself commander-in-chief of the Army in December 1941; from this point forward he personally directed the war against the Soviet Union, while his military commanders facing the Western Allies retained a degree of autonomy.{{sfn|Kershaw|2012|pp=169\u2013170}} Hitler's leadership became increasingly disconnected from reality as the war turned against Germany, with the military's defensive strategies often hindered by his slow decision making and frequent directives to hold untenable positions. Nevertheless, he continued to believe that only his leadership could deliver victory.{{sfn|Overy|2005a|pp=421\u2013425}} In the final months of the war Hitler refused to consider peace negotiations, regarding the destruction of Germany as preferable to surrender.{{sfn|Kershaw|2012|pp=396\u2013397}} The military did not challenge Hitler's dominance of the war effort, and senior officers generally supported and enacted his decisions.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=171\u2013395}}\n\n== Personal life ==\n=== Family ===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F051673-0059, Adolf Hitler und Eva Braun auf dem Berghof.jpg|thumb|Hitler in 1942 with his long-time lover [[Eva Braun]].]]\n{{Main|Hitler family|Sexuality of Adolf Hitler}}\nHitler created a public image as a celibate man without a domestic life, dedicated entirely to his political mission and the nation.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=130}}{{sfn|Bullock|1999|p=563}} He met his lover, [[Eva Braun]], in 1929,{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=378}} and married her on 29 April 1945, one day before they both committed suicide.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=947\u2013948}} In September 1931, his half-niece, [[Geli Raubal]], took her own life with Hitler's gun in his Munich apartment.

Molotov served as [[Premier of the Soviet Union|Chairman]] of the [[Council of People's Commissars]] (Premier) from 1930 to 1941, and as [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Soviet Union)|Minister of Foreign Affairs]] from 1939 to 1949 and from 1953 to 1956. He served as [[First Deputy Premier of the Soviet Union|First Deputy Premier]] from 1942 to 1957, when he was dismissed from the Presidium of the Central Committee by [[Nikita Khrushchev]]. Molotov was removed from all positions in 1961 after several years of obscurity.\n\nMolotov was the principal Soviet signatory of the [[Nazi Germany|German]]\u2013Soviet [[non-aggression pact]] of 1939 (also known as the [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact]]), whose most important provisions were added in the form of a secret protocol that stipulated an invasion of [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]] and partition of its territory between [[Nazi Germany]] and the Soviet Union. \n\nAfter World War II (the [[Great Patriotic War (term)|Great Patriotic War]]), Molotov was involved in negotiations with the Western allies, in which he became noted for his diplomatic skills. He retained his place as a leading Soviet diplomat and politician until March 1949, when he fell out of Stalin's favour and lost the foreign affairs ministry leadership to [[Andrei Vyshinsky]]. Molotov's relationship with Stalin deteriorated further, with Stalin criticising Molotov in a speech to the [[19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|19th Party Congress]]. However, after Stalin's death in 1953, Molotov was staunchly opposed to Khrushchev's [[de-Stalinisation]] policy. Molotov defended Stalin's policies and legacy until his death in 1986, and harshly criticised Stalin's successors, especially Khrushchev.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life and career (1890\u20131930)===\n[[Image:Molotov house Kukarka.JPG|thumb|200px|Molotov's birth house in [[Sovetsk, Kirov Oblast]].|left]]\n\nMolotov was born Vyacheslav Mikhailovich Skryabin in the village of [[Sovetsk, Kirov Oblast|Kukarka]], [[Yaransk]] [[Uyezd]], [[Vyatka Governorate]] (now Sovetsk in [[Kirov Oblast]]), the son of a butter churner. Contrary to a commonly repeated error, he was not related to the composer [[Alexander Scriabin]].{{sfn|Montefiore|2005|p=40}} Throughout his teen years, he was described as \"shy\" and \"quiet\", always assisting his father with his business. He was educated at a secondary school in [[Kazan]], and joined the [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]] (RSDLP) in 1906, soon gravitating toward that organisation's radical [[Bolshevik]] faction, headed by [[V. I. Lenin]].<ref name=Roberts5>[[Geoffrey Roberts]], ''Molotov: Stalin's Cold Warrior.''

In 1911, he enrolled at [[St Petersburg]] Polytechnic. Molotov joined the editorial staff of a new underground Bolshevik newspaper called ''[[Pravda]]'', meeting [[Joseph Stalin]] for the first time in association with the project.<ref name=Roberts6>Roberts, ''Molotov'', pg. 6.</ref> This first association between the two future Soviet leaders proved to be brief, however, and did not lead to an immediate close political association.<ref name=Roberts6 />\n\n[[File:Molotov VM.jpg|150px|thumb|left|Molotov in 1917]]\n\nMolotov worked as a so-called \"professional revolutionary\" for the next several years, writing for the party press and attempting to better organize the underground party.<ref name=Roberts6 /> He moved from St. Petersburg to Moscow in 1914 at the time of the outbreak of [[World War I]].<ref name=Roberts6 /> It was in Moscow the following year that Molotov was again arrested for his party activity, this time being deported to [[Irkutsk]] in eastern [[Siberia]].<ref name=Roberts6 /> In 1916, he escaped from his Siberian exile and returned to the capital city, now called Petrograd by the Tsarist regime, which thought the name St. Petersburg sounded excessively German.<ref name=Roberts6 />\n\nhe was nicknamed \"chav\" by his friends and was also referred to as Lazza, or Larry, due to his great, great uncle Larry Wain who was charged of assault. \n\nMolotov became a member of the Bolshevik Party's committee in [[Petrograd]] in 1916. When the [[February Revolution]] occurred in 1917, he was one of the few Bolsheviks of any standing in the capital. Under his direction ''[[Pravda]]'' took to the \"left\" to oppose the Provisional Government formed after the revolution.

Since he was not a military man, he took no part in the fighting. In 1920, he became secretary to the Central Committee of the Ukrainian Bolshevik Party. Lenin recalled him to Moscow in 1921, elevating him to full membership of the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Central Committee]] and [[Orgburo]], and putting him in charge of the party secretariat. He was voted in as a non-voting member of the [[Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Politburo]] in 1921 and held the office of [[Responsible Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Responsible Secretary]] and also married the Soviet politician [[Polina Zhemchuzhina]].\n\nHis Responsible Secretaryship was criticised by Lenin and [[Leon Trotsky]], with Lenin noting his \"shameful bureaucratism\" and stupid behaviour.{{sfn|Montefiore|2005|p=40}} On the advice of Molotov and [[Nikolai Bukharin]], the Central Committee decided to reduce Lenin's work hours.{{sfn|Service|2003|p=151}} In 1922, Stalin became [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|General Secretary of the Bolshevik Party]] with Molotov as the ''de facto'' [[Second Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Second Secretary]].

Germany still had to give proof 'of its respect for international obligations in keeping with the real interests of peace in Europe and peace generally'.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Molotov and the Sovnarkom 1930\u20131941|last=Watson|first=Derek|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=161}}</ref> As Litvinov during 1933 and 1934 had done his best to prevent the cordial relations created by Rapallo from declining, some do not think Litvinov would have disapproved of that statement; and if German policy had changed, Litvinov would have been delighted.

In his book ''Crisis in the Kremlin'', he states:\n\n<blockquote>It is well known in Moscow that Molotov always detested Litvinov.  Molotov's detestation for Litvinov was purely of a personal nature.  No Moscovite I have ever known, whether a friend of Molotov or of Litvinov, has ever taken exception to this view.  Molotov was always resentful of Litvinov's fluency in French, German and English, as he was distrustful of Litvinov's easy manner with foreigners.  Never having lived abroad, Molotov always suspected that there was something impure and sinful in Litvinov's broad mindedness and appreciation of Western civilisation.<ref>Hindus Maurice Crisis in the Kremlin</ref></blockquote>\n\nAlthough Litvinov never mentioned his relationship with Molotov in the foreign commissariat, Narkomindel press officer Genedin states: even though Litvinov never referred to their relationship (between Litvinov and Molotov) it was nevertheless well known it was bad.  Litvinov had no respect for a small minded intriguer and accomplice in terror like Molotov, and Molotov for his part had no love for Litvinov, who incidentally was the one people's commissioner to retain his independence.<ref>Medvedev All Stalin's Men p.488</ref>\n\n[[File:Great Purge Stalin Voroshilov Kaganovich Zhdanov Molotov.jpg|thumb|A list from the [[Great Purge]] signed by Molotov, Stalin, [[Kliment Voroshilov|Voroshilov]], [[Lazar Kaganovich|Kaganovich]] and [[Andrei Zhdanov|Zhdanov]]|293x293px]]\n\nMolotov was succeeded in his post as Premier by Stalin.{{sfn|Brown|2009|p=141}}\n\nAt first, Hitler rebuffed Soviet diplomatic hints that Stalin desired a treaty; but in early August 1939, Hitler authorised Foreign Minister [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]] to begin serious negotiations. A trade agreement was concluded on 18 August; and on 22 August, Ribbentrop flew to Moscow to conclude a formal non-aggression treaty. Although the treaty is known as the [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact]], it was Stalin and Hitler, and not Molotov and Ribbentrop, who decided the content of the treaty.\n\nThe most important part of the agreement was the secret protocol, which provided for the partition of [[Poland]], [[Finland]], and the [[Baltic States]] between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union and for the Soviet annexation of [[Bessarabia]] (then part of [[Romania]], now [[Moldova]]).{{sfn|Service|2003|p=256}} This protocol gave Hitler the green light for his [[German invasion of Poland|invasion of Poland]], which began on 1 September.{{sfn|Brown|2009|pp=90\u201392}} On 5 March 1940, [[Lavrentiy Beria]] gave Molotov, along with [[Anastas Mikoyan]], [[Kliment Voroshilov]] and Stalin, a note proposing the execution of 25,700 Polish officers and [[anti-Soviet]]s, in what has become known as the [[Katyn massacre]].{{sfn|Brown|2009|p=141}}\n\nUnder the Pact's terms, Hitler was, in effect, given authorisation to occupy two-thirds of [[Western Poland]], as well as [[Lithuania]]. Molotov was given a free hand in relation to Finland. In the [[Winter War]] that ensued, a combination of fierce Finnish resistance and Soviet mismanagement resulted in Finland losing parts of its territory, but not its independence.{{sfn|Service|2003|pp=256\u2013257}} The Pact was later amended to allocate Lithuania to the Soviet sphere in exchange for a more favourable border in Poland.

Though the purpose of Eden's visit was anti-German rather than anti-Soviet, Molotov assumed otherwise, and in a series of conversations with the Italian Ambassador Augusto Rosso, Molotov claimed that the Soviet Union would soon be faced with an Anglo\u2013Turkish invasion of the [[Crimea]]. The British historian D.C. Watt argued that, on the basis of Molotov's statements to Rosso, it would appear that, in early 1941, Stalin and Molotov viewed Britain rather than Germany as the principal threat.<ref>{{Cite book | author = Cameron Watt, Donald | title = Russia War, Peace and Diplomacy | publisher = [[Weidenfeld & Nicolson]] | year = 2004 | isbn = 0-415-14435-3 | pages = 276\u2013286 }}</ref>\n[[File:Molotov with Ribbentrop.jpg|200px|left|thumb|Molotov meets with [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]] before signing the [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact|German\u2013Soviet non-aggression pact]]]] \nThe Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact governed Soviet\u2013German relations until June 1941 when Hitler, having occupied France and neutralised Britain, turned east and [[German invasion of the Soviet Union|attacked the Soviet Union]].{{sfn|Service|2003|pp=158\u2013160}} Molotov was responsible for telling the [[Soviet people]] of the attack, when he instead of Stalin announced the war.

From there, he took a train to London to discuss with the [[British government]] the possibility of opening a second front against Germany.\n\nAfter signing the [[Anglo\u2013Soviet Treaty of 1942]] on 26 May, Molotov left for Washington, D.C., in the United States. Molotov met with [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], the President of the United States, and ratified a [[Lend-Lease]] Treaty between the USSR and the US.

In general, he was distinguished by an uncooperative attitude towards the Western powers. Molotov, at the direction of the Soviet government, condemned the [[Marshall Plan]] as imperialistic and claimed it was dividing Europe into two camps, one capitalist and the other communist. In response, the Soviet Union, along with the other [[Eastern Bloc]] nations, initiated what is known as the [[Molotov Plan]].

Molotov had no communication with her, save for the scant news that he got from Beria, whom he loathed.

Molotov served as [[Premier of the Soviet Union|Chairman]] of the [[Council of People's Commissars]] (Premier) from 1930 to 1941, and as [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Soviet Union)|Minister of Foreign Affairs]] from 1939 to 1949 and from 1953 to 1956. He served as [[First Deputy Premier of the Soviet Union|First Deputy Premier]] from 1942 to 1957, when he was dismissed from the Presidium of the Central Committee by [[Nikita Khrushchev]]. Molotov was removed from all positions in 1961 after several years of obscurity.\n\nMolotov was the principal Soviet signatory of the [[Nazi Germany|German]]\u2013Soviet [[non-aggression pact]] of 1939 (also known as the [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact]]), whose most important provisions were added in the form of a secret protocol that stipulated an invasion of [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]] and partition of its territory between [[Nazi Germany]] and the Soviet Union. \n\nAfter World War II (the [[Great Patriotic War (term)|Great Patriotic War]]), Molotov was involved in negotiations with the Western allies, in which he became noted for his diplomatic skills. He retained his place as a leading Soviet diplomat and politician until March 1949, when he fell out of Stalin's favour and lost the foreign affairs ministry leadership to [[Andrei Vyshinsky]]. Molotov's relationship with Stalin deteriorated further, with Stalin criticising Molotov in a speech to the [[19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|19th Party Congress]]. However, after Stalin's death in 1953, Molotov was staunchly opposed to Khrushchev's [[de-Stalinisation]] policy.

Molotov's detestation for Litvinov was purely of a personal nature.  No Moscovite I have ever known, whether a friend of Molotov or of Litvinov, has ever taken exception to this view.  Molotov was always resentful of Litvinov's fluency in French, German and English, as he was distrustful of Litvinov's easy manner with foreigners.

A clear sign of his precarious position was his inability to prevent the arrest for \"[[treason]]\", in December 1948, of his Jewish wife, [[Polina Zhemchuzhina]], whom Stalin had long distrusted.{{sfn|Brown|2009|pp=199\u2013201}} Molotov never stopped loving his wife, and it is said he ordered his maids to make dinner for two every evening to remind him that, in his own words, \"she suffered because of me\".{{sfn|Montefiore|2005|p=604}}\n\nPolina Zhemchuzhina befriended [[Golda Meir]], who arrived in Moscow in November 1948 as the first Israeli envoy to the USSR.<ref>[[Paul Johnson (writer)|Johnson, Paul]] (1987), ''A History of the Jews'', p. 527</ref> According to a close collaborator of Molotov, [[Vladimir Ivanovich Yerofeyev]],<ref>V.

Immediately afterwards, Polina was arrested and accused of ties with [[Zionist]] organisations. She was imprisoned for a year in the [[Lubyanka Building|Lubyanka]], after which she was exiled for three years in an obscure Russian city. Molotov had no communication with her, save for the scant news that he got from Beria, whom he loathed. Polina was freed immediately after the death of Stalin.{{sfn|Montefiore|2005|p=666}} According to Erofeev, Molotov said of her: \"She's not only beautiful and intelligent, the only woman minister in the Soviet Union; she's also a real [[Bolshevik]], a real Soviet person.\" \n[[File:Polina Zhemchuzhina.jpg|thumb|Molotov with his wife [[Polina Zhemchuzhina|Polina]]]]\nHowever Polina's feelings were not reciprocal.  Although virtually all historians assumed that when Polina was released she returned to live with her husband.  Holroyd-Doveton has discovered a statement by the Italian Communist Vittorio Vidali that he was told by Yelena Dmitryevna at the 20th Congress that Polina refused to return to her husband.  It is hardly surprising.  It is difficult to believe any wife would not be infuriated if they were being tortured while their husband was holding high political office.

Khrushchev attacked Stalin both over the purges of the 1930s and the defeats of the early years of World War II, which he blamed on Stalin's overly trusting attitude towards Hitler and his purges of the Red Army command structure. As Molotov was the most senior of Stalin's collaborators still in government and had played a leading role in the purges, it became evident that Khrushchev's examination of the past would probably result in Molotov's fall from power, and he became the leader of an old guard faction that sought to overthrow Khrushchev.{{sfn|Montefiore|2005|pp=666\u2013667}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-33241-0001, Moskau, Gala-Vorstellung f\u00fcr BRD-Regierungsdelegation.jpg|thumb|right|Molotov (far left) with Khrushchev (second from right) and Premier [[Nikolai Bulganin]] (to the left of Khrushchev) in 1955 at a gala reception in Moscow for the visit of West German Chancellor [[Konrad Adenauer]] (centre)]]In June 1956, Molotov was removed as Foreign Minister;{{sfn|Brown|2009|p=245}} on 29 June 1957, he was expelled from the Presidium (Politburo) after a failed attempt to remove Khrushchev as First Secretary.
