{"title_page": "Avadhanam", "text_new": "'''Avadh\u0101na\u1e43''' is a literary performance popular from the very ancient days in [[India]]. '''Avadh\u0101na\u1e43''' originated as a [[Sanskrit]] literary process and is revived by [[Kannada language|Kannada]] and [[Telugu language|Telugu]] poets in modern times.  It involves the partial [[improvisation]] of poems using specific themes, metres, forms, or words.<ref name=\"Indian Literature\">Amaresh Datta, ''The Encyclopaedia Of Indian Literature'', v. 1, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ObFCT5_taSgC&pg=PA292&dq=%22Avadhanam%22&hl=en&ei=lq4ETpi9MojX0QG13pCDCw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CC8Q6AEwATgK#v=onepage&q=%22Avadhanam%22&f=false \"Avadhanam\"] (Sahitya Akademi, 2006; {{ISBN|81-260-1803-8}})</ref> The true purpose of an Avadhanam event thus is the showcasing, through entertainment, of superior mastery of cognitive capabilities - of observation, memory, multitasking, task switching, retrieval, reasoning and creativity in multiple modes of intelligence - literature, poetry, music, mathematical calculations, puzzle solving etc.\n\nIt requires immense memory power and tests a person's capability of performing multiple tasks simultaneously. All the tasks are memory intensive and demand an in-depth knowledge of literature, and prosody. The tasks vary from making up a poem spontaneously to keeping a count of a bell ringing at random. No external memory aids are allowed while performing these tasks except the person's mind.<ref>[http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~tcslab/mfcs98page/mfcshtml/notes6/asta.html Computer Science department - IIT-Madras] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721150036/http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~tcslab/mfcs98page/mfcshtml/notes6/asta.html |date=July 21, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nAvadh\u0101na\u1e43 can be considered as the [[Procedural memory#Divided attention|Divided attention]] (clinical model of [[attention]]) as it is the highest level of attention and it refers to the ability to respond simultaneously to multiple tasks or multiple task demands.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.edb.utexas.edu/robinson/Attention/index.html|title=Attention|author=Dan Robinson |date= |work= |publisher=University of Texas at Austin|accessdate=12 December 2011}}{{dead link|date=November 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cognifit.com/science/cognitive-skills/divided-attention|title=Divided Attention|author= |date= |work= |publisher=[[Cognifit]] |accessdate=12 December 2011}}</ref>{{failed verification|date=May 2018}}\n\n''Avadh\u0101ni'' refers to the individual who performs the Avadh\u0101na\u1e43; one of the many individuals asking questions is a ''P\u1e5bcchaka'' (questioner). The first person to ask the question is called \"Pradh\u0101na P\u1e5bcchaka\" (s)he is the same as any other P\u1e5bcchaka except that he asks the first question. The questions asked are primarily literary in nature. The P\u1e5bcchakas can optionally place additional constraints.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.thehindu.com/arts/history-and-culture/article879927.ece |title=The Hindu - November 2010 |access-date=2011-03-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629132551/http://www.thehindu.com/arts/history-and-culture/article879927.ece |archive-date=2011-06-29 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Though it is not stated explicitly, conformation to ''[[Chandas]]'' (poetic metre) is mandatory. Avadh\u0101ni should answer them in the form of a poem. The questions generally consist of a description given in prose and the avadh\u0101ni has to express it as a poem. The additional restrictions placed by the P\u1e5bcchakas can be anything like asking the avadh\u0101ni not to use a given set of the alphabet in the entire poem or to construct only a particular type of poem etc.\n\n==Characteristics ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2018}}\nThe avadh\u0101ni is not allowed to recite the entire poem at once. After listening to the P\u1e5bucchaka's question, the avadh\u0101ni constructs the first line of the poem, recites it and moves to the next P\u1e5bcchaka. After listening to all the P\u1e5bucchakas, and reciting one line of poem each, the avadh\u0101ni shall return to the Pradhana prucchakas (in a round-robin fashion) and continues with the second line of the poem. The beauty and challenge here is that the avadh\u0101ni has to remember the question, the line of poem said before and all the additional constraints placed. They shall not be repeated and any mistake shall disqualify the person from being titled \"Avadhani\". Every poem has 4 lines, so each P\u1e5bcchaka's turn comes 4 times. Avadhaani has to recite the full poem once he finishes constructing all the lines of the poems. This is called \"dhara\u1e47a\" and forms the culmination of the Avadhana. Avadhani should use only his memory for all this. An Avadhana can run for multiple days (especially \u015aat\u0101vadh\u0101na).\n\nIt is a general practice for one of the P\u1e5bcchaka to keep ringing a bell randomly and avadhani has to keep track of number of bell rings. The multitutde of all these constraints makes Avadhana one of the greatest arts to master.\n\nOf the remaining P\u1e5bcchakas, one person is in charge of \"aprastuta-prasangam\" (irrelevant incident). His responsibility is to distract the avadhani with questions and topics unrelated to the avadhanam and the avadhani has to reply to his questions and riddles. The P\u1e5bcchaka who manages this should also be equally intelligent and witty to entertain the audience with his questions. An additional challenge for Avadhani here is not to get distracted by these digressions and give witty answers spontaneously even to some of the silly questions.such great memory and retention(dharana) is most important and Shri.Garapati excels at this especially.\n\nOwing to the memory intensive nature of Avadhana, the number of P\u1e5bcchakas plays a major role. The more the number of P\u1e5bcchakas, the higher the challenge would be. Besides conducting Avadhanas, which in itself is a great feat, many Avadhanis also left a longer and lasting legacy by penning works and mentoring students who often grew up to contribute to Telugu and Kannada literature in their own uniquely rich ways.\n\n==Types ==\nThe number of P\u1e5bcchakas can be 8 (A\u1e63t\u0101vadh\u0101na\u1e43) or 100 (\u015aat\u0101vadh\u0101na\u1e43) or even 1000 (sahasr\u0101vadh\u0101na\u1e43). A person who has successfully performed an Ashtavadhana is called as A\u1e63t\u0101vadh\u0101ni, a \u015aat\u0101vadh\u0101na\u1e43 is called a \u015aat\u0101vadh\u0101ni and a sahasr\u0101vadh\u0101na\u1e43 is called Sahasr\u0101vadh\u0101ni.\nThe other lesser known forms of Avadhana are Chitravadhanam (painting), Nruty\u0101vadh\u0101na\u1e43 (Dancing) and Ga\u1e47it\u0101vadh\u0101na\u1e43 (Mathematics). Netr\u0101vadh\u0101na\u1e43 (using the eyes) is another important form of avadh\u0101na\u1e43.\n\n===Middle Ages===\n\nEven though this technique has existed prior to the Middle Ages, most of the available historic texts are available today describing encounters in the courts of Turk Invaders.\n\nSeveral Jain Avadhanis displayed the art of Avadhanam in front of Mughal emperors and their [[Subahdar]]s (governors). Nandivijay, a disciple of the monk Vijayasen Suri, performed the Ashtavadhana in front of [[Akbar]].

'''Avadh\u0101na\u1e43''' originated as a [[Sanskrit]] literary process and is revived by [[Kannada language|Kannada]] and [[Telugu language|Telugu]] poets in modern times.  It involves the partial [[improvisation]] of poems using specific themes, metres, forms, or words.<ref name=\"Indian Literature\">Amaresh Datta, ''The Encyclopaedia Of Indian Literature'', v. 1, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ObFCT5_taSgC&pg=PA292&dq=%22Avadhanam%22&hl=en&ei=lq4ETpi9MojX0QG13pCDCw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CC8Q6AEwATgK#v=onepage&q=%22Avadhanam%22&f=false \"Avadhanam\"] (Sahitya Akademi, 2006; {{ISBN|81-260-1803-8}})</ref> The true purpose of an Avadhanam event thus is the showcasing, through entertainment, of superior mastery of cognitive capabilities - of observation, memory, multitasking, task switching, retrieval, reasoning and creativity in multiple modes of intelligence - literature, poetry, music, mathematical calculations, puzzle solving etc.\n\nIt requires immense memory power and tests a person's capability of performing multiple tasks simultaneously. All the tasks are memory intensive and demand an in-depth knowledge of literature, and prosody. The tasks vary from making up a poem spontaneously to keeping a count of a bell ringing at random. No external memory aids are allowed while performing these tasks except the person's mind.<ref>[http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~tcslab/mfcs98page/mfcshtml/notes6/asta.html Computer Science department - IIT-Madras] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721150036/http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~tcslab/mfcs98page/mfcshtml/notes6/asta.html |date=July 21, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nAvadh\u0101na\u1e43 can be considered as the [[Procedural memory#Divided attention|Divided attention]] (clinical model of [[attention]]) as it is the highest level of attention and it refers to the ability to respond simultaneously to multiple tasks or multiple task demands.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.edb.utexas.edu/robinson/Attention/index.html|title=Attention|author=Dan Robinson |date= |work= |publisher=University of Texas at Austin|accessdate=12 December 2011}}{{dead link|date=November 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cognifit.com/science/cognitive-skills/divided-attention|title=Divided Attention|author= |date= |work= |publisher=[[Cognifit]] |accessdate=12 December 2011}}</ref>{{failed verification|date=May 2018}}\n\n''Avadh\u0101ni'' refers to the individual who performs the Avadh\u0101na\u1e43; one of the many individuals asking questions is a ''P\u1e5bcchaka'' (questioner). The first person to ask the question is called \"Pradh\u0101na P\u1e5bcchaka\" (s)he is the same as any other P\u1e5bcchaka except that he asks the first question. The questions asked are primarily literary in nature. The P\u1e5bcchakas can optionally place additional constraints.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.thehindu.com/arts/history-and-culture/article879927.ece |title=The Hindu - November 2010 |access-date=2011-03-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629132551/http://www.thehindu.com/arts/history-and-culture/article879927.ece |archive-date=2011-06-29 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Though it is not stated explicitly, conformation to ''[[Chandas]]'' (poetic metre) is mandatory. Avadh\u0101ni should answer them in the form of a poem. The questions generally consist of a description given in prose and the avadh\u0101ni has to express it as a poem. The additional restrictions placed by the P\u1e5bcchakas can be anything like asking the avadh\u0101ni not to use a given set of the alphabet in the entire poem or to construct only a particular type of poem etc.\n\n==Characteristics ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2018}}\nThe avadh\u0101ni is not allowed to recite the entire poem at once. After listening to the P\u1e5bucchaka's question, the avadh\u0101ni constructs the first line of the poem, recites it and moves to the next P\u1e5bcchaka. After listening to all the P\u1e5bucchakas, and reciting one line of poem each, the avadh\u0101ni shall return to the Pradhana prucchakas (in a round-robin fashion) and continues with the second line of the poem. The beauty and challenge here is that the avadh\u0101ni has to remember the question, the line of poem said before and all the additional constraints placed. They shall not be repeated and any mistake shall disqualify the person from being titled \"Avadhani\". Every poem has 4 lines, so each P\u1e5bcchaka's turn comes 4 times. Avadhaani has to recite the full poem once he finishes constructing all the lines of the poems. This is called \"dhara\u1e47a\" and forms the culmination of the Avadhana. Avadhani should use only his memory for all this. An Avadhana can run for multiple days (especially \u015aat\u0101vadh\u0101na).\n\nIt is a general practice for one of the P\u1e5bcchaka to keep ringing a bell randomly and avadhani has to keep track of number of bell rings. The multitutde of all these constraints makes Avadhana one of the greatest arts to master.\n\nOf the remaining P\u1e5bcchakas, one person is in charge of \"aprastuta-prasangam\" (irrelevant incident). His responsibility is to distract the avadhani with questions and topics unrelated to the avadhanam and the avadhani has to reply to his questions and riddles. The P\u1e5bcchaka who manages this should also be equally intelligent and witty to entertain the audience with his questions. An additional challenge for Avadhani here is not to get distracted by these digressions and give witty answers spontaneously even to some of the silly questions.such great memory and retention(dharana) is most important and Shri.Garapati excels at this especially.\n\nOwing to the memory intensive nature of Avadhana, the number of P\u1e5bcchakas plays a major role. The more the number of P\u1e5bcchakas, the higher the challenge would be. Besides conducting Avadhanas, which in itself is a great feat, many Avadhanis also left a longer and lasting legacy by penning works and mentoring students who often grew up to contribute to Telugu and kannada literature in their own uniquely rich ways.\n\n==Types ==\nThe number of P\u1e5bcchakas can be 8 (A\u1e63t\u0101vadh\u0101na\u1e43) or 100 (\u015aat\u0101vadh\u0101na\u1e43) or even 1000 (sahasr\u0101vadh\u0101na\u1e43). A person who has successfully performed an Ashtavadhana is called as A\u1e63t\u0101vadh\u0101ni, a \u015aat\u0101vadh\u0101na\u1e43 is called a \u015aat\u0101vadh\u0101ni and a sahasr\u0101vadh\u0101na\u1e43 is called Sahasr\u0101vadh\u0101ni.\nThe other lesser known forms of Avadhana are Chitravadhanam (painting), Nruty\u0101vadh\u0101na\u1e43 (Dancing) and Ga\u1e47it\u0101vadh\u0101na\u1e43 (Mathematics). Netr\u0101vadh\u0101na\u1e43 (using the eyes) is another important form of avadh\u0101na\u1e43.\n\n===Middle Ages===\n\nEven though this technique has existed prior to the middle ages, most of the available historic texts are available today describing encounters in the courts of Turk Invaders.\n\n\n\nSeveral Jain Avadhanis displayed the art of Avadhanam in front of Mughal emperors and their [[Subahdar]]s (governors).

Now they are mostly used for electric power generation.\nWater turbines are mostly found in [[dam]]s to generate electric power from water potentialarshad mangrio use see this file energy.\n\n==History==\n\n[[File:Turbinaszerel\u00e9s.jpg|thumb|right|The construction of a [[Ganz Works|Ganz]] water Turbo Generator in Budapest in 1886]]\n\nWater wheels have been used for hundreds of years for industrial power.  Their main shortcoming is size, which limits the flow rate and [[head (hydraulic)|head]] that can be harnessed.\nThe migration from water wheels to modern turbines took about one  hundred years. Development occurred during the [[Industrial revolution]], using scientific principles and methods.  They also made extensive use of new materials and manufacturing methods developed at the time.\n\n=== Swirl ===\nThe word [[turbine]] was introduced by the French engineer [[Claude Burdin]] in the early 19th century  and is derived from the Greek word \"\u03c4\u03cd\u03c1\u03b2\u03b7\" for \"whirling\" or a \"vortex\". The main difference between early water turbines and water wheels is a swirl component of the water which passes energy to a spinning rotor. This additional component of motion allowed the turbine to be smaller than a water wheel of the same power. They could process more water by spinning faster and could harness much greater heads. (Later, impulse turbines were developed which didn't use swirl.)\n\n=== Timeline ===\n[[File:Roman mill at Chemtou.jpg|thumb|upright|Roman turbine mill at [[Chemtou]], [[Tunisia]].

Two helix-turbine mill sites of almost identical design were found at [[Chemtou]] and [[Testour]], modern-day [[Tunisia]], dating to the late 3rd or early 4th century AD. The horizontal water wheel with angled blades was installed at the bottom of a water-filled, circular shaft. The water from the mill-race entered the pit tangentially, creating a swirling water column which made the fully submerged wheel act like a true turbine.<ref name=\"Roman helix-turbine mill\">{{harvnb|Wilson|1995|pp=507f.}}; {{harvnb|Wikander|2000|p=377}}; {{harvnb|Donners|Waelkens|Deckers|2002|p=13}}</ref>\n\n[[Fausto Veranzio]] in his book ''Machinae Novae'' (1595) described a vertical axis mill with a rotor similar to that of a [[Francis turbine]].<ref>{{cite news | authors=C Rossi; F Russo; F Russo | title=Ancient Engineers' Inventions: Precursors of the Present | publisher=Springer | year=2009 | ISBN=904812252X}}</ref>\n\n[[Johann Andreas Segner|Johann Segner]] developed a reactive water turbine ([[Segner wheel]]) in the mid-18th century in [[Kingdom of Hungary]].  It had a horizontal axis and was a precursor to modern water turbines. It is a very simple machine that is still produced today for use in small hydro sites. Segner worked with [[Euler]] on some of the early mathematical theories of turbine design. In the 18th century, a Dr. Robert Barker invented a similar reaction hydraulic turbine that became popular as a lecture-hall demonstration.<ref>Musson, Albert and Robinson, Eric.

Nomination Number 177.|author=|date=|website=asme.org}}</ref>\n\nIn 1820, [[Jean-Victor Poncelet]] developed an inward-flow turbine.\n\nIn 1826, [[Beno\u00eet Fourneyron]] developed an outward-flow turbine. This was an efficient machine (~80%) that sent water through a runner with blades curved in one dimension. The stationary outlet also had curved guides.\n\nIn 1844, [[Uriah A. Boyden]] developed an outward flow turbine that improved on the performance of the Fourneyron turbine. Its runner shape was similar to that of a [[Francis turbine]].\n\nIn 1849, [[James B. Francis]] improved the inward flow reaction turbine to over 90% efficiency. He also conducted sophisticated tests and developed engineering methods for water turbine design.  The [[Francis turbine]], named for him, is the first modern water turbine.  It is still the most widely used water turbine in the world today. The Francis turbine is also called a radial flow turbine, since water flows from  the outer circumference towards the centre of runner.\n\nInward flow water turbines have a better mechanical arrangement and all modern reaction water turbines are of this design. As the water swirls inward, it accelerates, and transfers energy to the runner. Water pressure decreases to atmospheric, or in some cases subatmospheric, as the water passes through the turbine blades and loses energy.\n\nAround 1890, the modern [[fluid bearing]] was invented, now universally used to support heavy water turbine spindles.  As of 2002, fluid bearings appear to have a [[mean time between failures]] of more than 1300 years.\n\nAround 1913, [[Viktor Kaplan]] created the [[Kaplan turbine]], a propeller-type machine. It was an evolution of the Francis turbine and revolutionized the ability to develop low-head hydro sites.\n\n=== New concept ===\n[[File:Pelton wheel (patent).png|thumb|right|Figure from Pelton's original patent (October 1880)]]\n{{Main|Pelton wheel}}\n\nAll common water machines until the late 19th century (including water wheels) were basically reaction machines; water ''pressure'' head acted on the machine and produced work.  A reaction turbine needs to fully contain the water during energy transfer.\n\nIn 1866, California millwright Samuel Knight invented a machine that took the impulse system to a new level.<ref>W. A. Doble, ''The Tangential Water Wheel'', Transactions of the American Institute of Mining Engineers, Vol. XXIX, 1899.</ref><ref>W. F. Durrand, ''The Pelton Water Wheel'', Stanford University, Mechanical Engineering, 1939.</ref> Inspired by the high pressure jet systems used in hydraulic mining in the gold fields, Knight developed a bucketed wheel which captured the energy of a free jet, which had converted a high head (hundreds of vertical feet in a pipe or [[penstock]]) of water to kinetic energy. This is called an impulse or tangential turbine. The water's velocity, roughly twice the velocity of the bucket periphery, does a U-turn in the bucket and drops out of the runner at low velocity.\n\nIn 1879, [[Lester Allan Pelton|Lester Pelton]], experimenting with a Knight Wheel, developed a [[Pelton wheel]] (double bucket design), which exhausted the water to the side, eliminating some energy loss of the Knight wheel which exhausted some water back against the center of the wheel. In about 1895, William Doble improved on Pelton's half-cylindrical bucket form with an elliptical bucket that included  a cut in it to allow the jet a cleaner bucket entry. This is the modern form of the Pelton turbine which today achieves up to 92% efficiency. Pelton had been quite an effective promoter of his design and although Doble took over the Pelton company he did not change the name to Doble because it had brand name recognition.\n\n[[Turgo turbine|Turgo]] and [[cross-flow turbine]]s were later impulse designs.\n\n== Theory of operation ==\nFlowing water is directed on to the blades of a turbine runner, creating a force on the blades. Since the runner is spinning, the force acts through a distance (force acting through a distance is the definition of  [[Mechanical work|work]]). In this way, energy is transferred from the water flow to the turbine.\n\nWater turbines are divided into two groups: [[reaction (physics)|reaction]] turbines and [[Impulse (physics)|impulse]] turbines.\n\nThe precise shape of water turbine blades is a function of the supply pressure of water, and the type of impeller selected.\n\n=== Reaction turbines ===\nReaction turbines are acted on by water, which changes pressure as it moves through the turbine and gives up its energy. They must be encased to contain the water pressure (or suction), or they must be fully submerged in the water flow.\n\n[[Newton's laws of motion#Newton's third law|Newton's third law]] describes the transfer of energy for reaction turbines.\n\nMost water turbines in use are reaction turbines and are used in low (<{{convert|30|m|sigfig=1|disp=or|abbr=on}}) and medium ({{convert|30|-|300|m|sigfig=1|disp=or|abbr=on}}) head applications.\nIn reaction turbine pressure drop occurs in both fixed and moving blades.\nIt is largely used in dam and large power plants\n\n=== Impulse turbines ===\nImpulse turbines change the velocity of a water jet. The jet pushes on the turbine's curved blades which changes the direction of the flow. The resulting change in momentum ([[Impulse (physics)|impulse]]) causes a force on the turbine blades. Since the turbine is spinning, the force acts through a distance (work) and the diverted water flow is left with diminished energy. An impulse turbine is one in which the pressure of the fluid flowing over the rotor blades is constant and all the work output is due to the change in kinetic energy of the fluid.\n\nPrior to hitting the turbine blades, the water's pressure ([[potential energy]]) is converted to kinetic energy by a [[nozzle]] and focused on the turbine. No pressure change occurs at the turbine blades, and the turbine doesn't require a housing for operation.\n\nNewton's second law describes the transfer of energy for impulse turbines.\n\nImpulse turbines are often used in very high (>300m/1000&nbsp;ft) head applications.\n\n=== Power ===\nThe [[Power (physics)|power]] available in a stream of water is;\n\n<math>P=\\eta\\cdot\\rho\\cdot g\\cdot h\\cdot\\dot q</math>\n\nwhere:\n\n*<math>P=</math>     power (J/s or watts)\n*<math>\\eta=</math>  turbine efficiency\n*<math>\\rho=</math>  density of water (kg/m\u00b3)\n*<math>g=</math>     acceleration of gravity (9.81&nbsp;m/s\u00b2)\n*<math>h=</math>     head (m). For still water, this is the difference in height between the inlet and outlet surfaces. Moving water has an additional component added to account for the kinetic energy of the flow. The total head equals the ''pressure head'' plus ''velocity head''.\n*<math>\\dot q</math>= flow rate (m\u00b3/s)\n\n=== Pumped-storage hydroelectricity ===\nSome water turbines are designed for pumped-storage hydroelectricity. They can reverse flow and operate as a [[pump]]<ref name=\"Roman helix-turbine mill\" /> to fill a high reservoir during off-peak electrical hours, and then revert to a water turbine for power generation during peak electrical demand. This type of turbine is usually a [[Deriaz turbine|Deriaz]] or [[Francis turbine]] in design.\n\nThis type of system is used in El Hierro, one of the Canary Islands: \"When wind production exceeds demand, excess energy will pump water from a lower reservoir at the bottom of a volcanic cone to an upper reservoir at the top of the volcano 700 meters above sea level. The lower reservoir stores 150,000 cubic meters of water. The stored water acts as a battery. The maximum storage capacity is 270 MWh. When demand rises and there is not enough wind power, the water will be released to four hydroelectric turbines with a total capacity of 11 MW.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.greenbiz.com/blog/2014/03/03/how-small-spanish-island-became-renewable-energy-pioneer-el-hierro|title=How a small Spanish island became a renewable energy pioneer|first=Laurie|last=Guevara-Stone|date=3 March 2014|website=greenbiz.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://euanmearns.com/an-independent-evaluation-of-the-el-hierro-wind-pumped-hydro-system/|title=An Independent Evaluation of the El Hierro Wind & Pumped Hydro System|first=Benjamin|last=Jargstorf|date=23 February 2017|website=euanmearns.com/}}</ref>\n\n=== Efficiency ===\nLarge modern water turbines operate at [[mechanical efficiency|mechanical efficiencies]] greater than 90%.\n\n== Types of water turbines ==\n[[File:Water turbine runners.jpg|thumb|right|Various types of water turbine runners. From left to right: Pelton wheel, two types of Francis turbine and Kaplan turbine.]]\n\nReaction turbines:\n*[[VLH turbine]]\n*[[Francis turbine]]\n*[[Kaplan turbine]]\n*[[Tyson turbine]]\n*[[Deriaz turbine]]\n*[[Gorlov helical turbine]]\n\nImpulse turbine\n*[[Water wheel]]\n*[[Pelton wheel]]\n*[[Turgo turbine]]\n*[[Cross-flow turbine]] (also known as the B\u00e1nki-Michell turbine, or Ossberger turbine)\n*[[Jonval turbine]]\n*[[Reverse overshot water-wheel]]\n*[[Screw turbine]]\n* Barkh Turbine\n\n== Design and application ==\n[[File:Water Turbine Chart.png|right|350px]]\n\nTurbine selection is based on the available water head, and less so on the available flow rate.  In general, impulse turbines are used for high head sites, and reaction turbines are used for [[Low head hydro power|low head]] sites. Kaplan turbines with adjustable blade pitch are well-adapted to wide ranges of flow or head conditions, since their peak efficiency can be achieved over a wide range of flow conditions.\n\nSmall turbines (mostly under 10 MW) may have horizontal shafts, and even fairly large bulb-type turbines up to 100 MW or so may be horizontal.  Very large Francis and Kaplan machines usually have vertical shafts because this  makes best use of the available head, and makes installation of a generator more economical.  Pelton wheels may be either vertical or horizontal shaft machines because the size of the machine is so much less than the available head.   Some impulse turbines use multiple jets per runner to balance shaft thrust.  This also allows for the use of a smaller turbine runner, which can decrease costs and mechanical losses.\n\n=== Typical range of heads ===\n<div style=\"width:400px;\">\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-break}}\n\u2022 [[Water wheel]]<br/>\n\u2022 [[Screw turbine]]<br/>\n\u2022 [[VLH turbine]]<br/>\n\u2022 [[Kaplan turbine]]<br/>\n\u2022 [[Francis turbine]]<br/>\n\u2022 [[Pelton wheel]]<br/>\n\u2022 [[Turgo turbine]]<br/>\n{{col-break}}\n0.2 < ''H'' < 4 &nbsp;&nbsp;(''H'' = head in m)<br/>\n1 < ''H'' < 10<br/>\n1.5 < ''H'' < 4.5<br/>\n2 < ''H'' < 70<br/>\n10 < ''H'' < 300<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.alstom.com/power/renewables/hydro/hydro-turbines/francis-turbines/|title=Francis hydro turbines|author=|date=|website=alstom.com}}</ref><br/>\n80 < ''H'' < 1600<br/>\n50 < ''H'' < 250\n{{col-end}}\n</div>\n\n=== Specific speed ===\n{{Main|Specific speed}}\n\nThe specific speed <math> n_s </math> of a turbine characterizes the turbine's shape in a way that is not related to its size. This allows a new turbine design to be scaled from an existing design of known performance. The specific speed is also the main criteria for matching a specific hydro site with the correct turbine type.\nThe specific speed is the speed with which the turbine turns for a particular discharge Q, with unit head and thereby is able to produce unit power.\n\n=== Affinity laws ===\n[[Affinity laws]] allow the output of a turbine to be predicted based on model tests.  A miniature replica of a proposed design, about one foot (0.3 m) in diameter, can be tested and the laboratory measurements applied to the final application with high confidence. Affinity laws are derived by requiring [[similitude (model)|similitude]] between the test model and the application.\n\nFlow through the turbine is controlled either by a large valve or by wicket gates arranged around the outside of the turbine runner.  Differential head and flow can be plotted for a number of different values of gate opening, producing a hill diagram used to show the efficiency of the turbine at varying conditions.\n\n=== Runaway speed ===\nThe '''runaway speed''' of a water turbine is its speed at full flow, and no shaft load. The turbine will be designed to survive the mechanical forces of this speed. The manufacturer will supply the runaway speed rating.\n\n== Control systems ==\n[[File:From Turbine to Line Shaft.webm|thumb|Operation of a [[flyball governor]] to control speeds of a water turbine]]\n\nDifferent designs of [[Governor (device)|governors]] have been used since the mid-18th century to control the speeds of the water turbines. A variety of [[centrifugal governor|flyball]] systems, or first-generation governors, were used during the first 100 years of water turbine speed controls. In early flyball systems, the flyball component countered by a spring acted directly to the valve of the turbine or the [[wicket gate]] to control the amount of water that enters the turbines. Newer systems with mechanical governors started around 1880. An early mechanical governor is a [[servomechanism]] that comprises a series of gears that use the turbine's speed to drive the flyball and turbine's power to drive the control mechanism. The mechanical governors were continued to be enhanced in power amplification through the use of gears and the dynamic behavior. By 1930, the mechanical governors had many parameters that could be set on the feedback system for precise controls. In the later part of the twentieth century, electronic governors and digital systems started to replace the mechanical governors. In the electronic governors, also known as second-generation governors, the flyball was replaced by rotational speed [[sensor]] but the controls were still done through [[Analog device|analog]] systems. In the modern systems, also known as third-generation governors, the controls are performed digitally by [[algorithm]]s that are programmed to the computer of the governor.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Fasol|first1=Karl Heinz|title=A Short History of Hydropower Control|journal=IEEE Control Systems Magazine|date=August 2002|pages=68\u201376|url=http://ieeecss.org/CSM/library/2002/aug02/04-HistoricalPerspectives.pdf|accessdate=29 January 2015}}</ref>\n\n== Turbine blade materials ==\nGiven that the turbine blades in a water turbine are constantly exposed to water and dynamic forces, they need to have high corrosion resistance and strength. The most common material used in overlays on carbon steel runners in water turbines are austenitic steel alloys that have 17% to 20% chromium to increase stability of the film which improves aqueous corrosion resistance. The chromium content in these steel alloys exceed the minimum of 12% chromium required to exhibit some atmospheric corrosion resistance. Having a higher chromium concentration in the steel alloys allows for a much longer lifespan of the turbine blades. Currently, the blades are made of martensitic stainless steels which have high strength compared to austenitic stainless steels by a factor of 2.<ref name=\"Spicher\">{{ Citation\n | last = Spicher\n | first = Thomas\n | author-link = Thomas Spicher\n | year = 2013\n | title = Choosing the Right Material for Turbine Runners\n | periodical = Hydro Review\n | volume = 32\n | issue = 6\n}}</ref> Besides corrosion resistance and strength as the criteria for material selection, weld-ability and density of the turbine blade.  Greater weld-ability allows for easier repair of the turbine blades. This also allows for higher weld quality which results in a better repair. Selecting a material with low density is important to achieve higher efficiency because the lighter blades rotate more easily. The most common material used in Kaplan Turbine blades are stainless steel alloys (SS). The martensitic stainless steel alloys have high strength, thinner sections than standard carbon steel, and reduced mass that enhances the hydrodynamic flow conditions and efficiency of the water turbine.<ref name=\"Spicher\" /> The SS(13Cr-4Ni) has been shown to have improved erosion resistance at all angles of attack through the process of laser hardening.<ref>{{ Citation\n | last1 = Padhy\n | first1 = M.\n | last2 = Senapati\n | first2 = P.\n | year = 2015\n | title = Turbine Blade Materials Used For The Power Plants Exposed to High Silt Erosion- A Review\n | periodical = ICHPSD\n}}</ref> It is important to minimize erosion in order to maintain high efficiencies because erosion negatively impacts the hydraulic profile of the blades which reduces the relative ease to rotate.<ref>{{ Citation\n | last = Gummer\n | first = John\n | author-link = John Gummer\n | year = 2009\n | title = Combating Silt Erosion in Hydraulic Turbines\n | periodical = Hydro Review\n | volume = 17\n | issue = 1\n}}</ref>\n\n== Maintenance ==\n[[File:Turbine Francis Worn.JPG|thumb|left|A [[Francis turbine]] at the end of its life showing [[pitting corrosion]], [[Fatigue (material)|fatigue cracking]] and a catastrophic failure.

Maintenance of the runners and parts exposed to water include removal, inspection, and repair of worn parts.\n\nNormal wear and tear includes [[pitting corrosion]] from [[cavitation]], [[Fatigue (material)|fatigue cracking]], and [[Abrasive|abrasion]] from suspended solids in the water. Steel elements are repaired by welding, usually with [[stainless steel]] rods. Damaged areas are cut or ground out, then welded back up to their original or an improved profile. Old turbine runners may have a significant amount of stainless steel added this way by the end of their lifetime. Elaborate [[welding]] procedures may be used to achieve the highest quality repairs.<ref>Cline, Roger:[http://www.usbr.gov/power/data/fist/fist2_7/fist2-7.pdf ''Mechanical Overhaul Procedures for Hydroelectric Units (Facilities Instructions, Standards, and Techniques, Volume 2-7)'']; United States Department of the Interior Bureau of Reclamation, Denver, Colorado, July 1994 (800KB pdf).</ref>\n\nOther elements requiring inspection and repair during overhauls include [[Bearing (mechanical)|bearings]], packing box and shaft sleeves, servomotors, cooling systems for the bearings and generator coils, seal rings, wicket gate linkage elements and all surfaces.<ref>United States Department of the Interior Bureau of Reclamation; Duncan, William (revised April 1989): [http://www.usbr.gov/power/data/fist/fist2_5/vol2-5.pdf ''Turbine Repair (Facilities Instructions, Standards & Techniques, Volume 2-5)''] (1.5 MB pdf).</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n== Environmental impact ==\n{{Main|Environmental impacts of reservoirs}}\n[[File:Central hidroel\u00e9ctrica de Walchensee, Kochel, Baviera, Alemania, 2014-03-22, DD 04.JPG|thumb|[[Walchensee Hydroelectric Power Station]] in [[Bavaria]], Germany, has been in operation since 1924]]\nWater turbines are generally considered a clean power producer, as the turbine causes essentially no change to the water. They use a renewable energy source and are designed to operate for decades. They produce significant amounts of the world's electrical supply.\n\nHistorically there have also been negative consequences, mostly associated with the dams normally required for power production.  Dams alter the natural ecology of rivers, potentially killing fish, stopping [[Fish migration|migrations]], and disrupting peoples' livelihoods. For example, [[American Indians in the United States|Native American]] tribes in the [[Pacific Northwest]] had livelihoods built around [[salmon]] [[fishing]], but aggressive dam-building destroyed their way of life. Dams also cause less obvious, but potentially serious consequences, including increased evaporation of water (especially in arid regions), buildup of [[silt]] behind the dam, and changes to water temperature and flow patterns. In the [[United States]], it is now illegal to block the migration of fish, for example the [[white sturgeon]] in [[North America]], so [[fish ladder]]s must be provided by dam builders.\n\narshad mangrio== See also ==\n{{Commons category|Water turbines|Water Turbines}}\n\n* [[Archimedes' screw]]\n* [[Hydroelectricity]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Notes==\n*Robert Sackett, Preservationist, PRSHPO (Original 1990 draft).

Now they are mostly used for electric power generation.\nWater turbines are mostly found in [[dam]]s to generate electric power from water potential energy.\n\n==History==\n\n[[File:Turbinaszerel\u00e9s.jpg|thumb|right|The construction of a [[Ganz Works|Ganz]] water Turbo Generator in Budapest in 1886]]\n\nWater wheels have been used for hundreds of years for industrial power.  Their main shortcoming is size, which limits the flow rate and [[head (hydraulic)|head]] that can be harnessed.\nThe migration from water wheels to modern turbines took about one  hundred years. Development occurred during the [[Industrial revolution]], using scientific principles and methods.  They also made extensive use of new materials and manufacturing methods developed at the time.\n\n=== Swirl ===\nThe word [[turbine]] was introduced by the French engineer [[Claude Burdin]] in the early 19th century  and is derived from the Greek word \"\u03c4\u03cd\u03c1\u03b2\u03b7\" for \"whirling\" or a \"vortex\". The main difference between early water turbines and water wheels is a swirl component of the water which passes energy to a spinning rotor. This additional component of motion allowed the turbine to be smaller than a water wheel of the same power. They could process more water by spinning faster and could harness much greater heads. (Later, impulse turbines were developed which didn't use swirl.)\n\n=== Timeline ===\n[[File:Roman mill at Chemtou.jpg|thumb|upright|Roman turbine mill at [[Chemtou]], [[Tunisia]].

Two helix-turbine mill sites of almost identical design were found at [[Chemtou]] and [[Testour]], modern-day [[Tunisia]], dating to the late 3rd or early 4th century AD. The horizontal water wheel with angled blades was installed at the bottom of a water-filled, circular shaft. The water from the mill-race entered the pit tangentially, creating a swirling water column which made the fully submerged wheel act like a true turbine.<ref name=\"Roman helix-turbine mill\">{{harvnb|Wilson|1995|pp=507f.}}; {{harvnb|Wikander|2000|p=377}}; {{harvnb|Donners|Waelkens|Deckers|2002|p=13}}</ref>\n\n[[Fausto Veranzio]] in his book ''Machinae Novae'' (1595) described a vertical axis mill with a rotor similar to that of a [[Francis turbine]].<ref>{{cite news | authors=C Rossi; F Russo; F Russo | title=Ancient Engineers' Inventions: Precursors of the Present | publisher=Springer | year=2009 | ISBN=904812252X}}</ref>\n\n[[Johann Andreas Segner|Johann Segner]] developed a reactive water turbine ([[Segner wheel]]) in the mid-18th century in [[Kingdom of Hungary]].  It had a horizontal axis and was a precursor to modern water turbines. It is a very simple machine that is still produced today for use in small hydro sites. Segner worked with [[Euler]] on some of the early mathematical theories of turbine design. In the 18th century, a Dr. Robert Barker invented a similar reaction hydraulic turbine that became popular as a lecture-hall demonstration.<ref>Musson, Albert and Robinson, Eric.

Nomination Number 177.|author=|date=|website=asme.org}}</ref>\n\nIn 1820, [[Jean-Victor Poncelet]] developed an inward-flow turbine.\n\nIn 1826, [[Beno\u00eet Fourneyron]] developed an outward-flow turbine. This was an efficient machine (~80%) that sent water through a runner with blades curved in one dimension. The stationary outlet also had curved guides.\n\nIn 1844, [[Uriah A. Boyden]] developed an outward flow turbine that improved on the performance of the Fourneyron turbine. Its runner shape was similar to that of a [[Francis turbine]].\n\nIn 1849, [[James B. Francis]] improved the inward flow reaction turbine to over 90% efficiency. He also conducted sophisticated tests and developed engineering methods for water turbine design.  The [[Francis turbine]], named for him, is the first modern water turbine.  It is still the most widely used water turbine in the world today. The Francis turbine is also called a radial flow turbine, since water flows from  the outer circumference towards the centre of runner.\n\nInward flow water turbines have a better mechanical arrangement and all modern reaction water turbines are of this design. As the water swirls inward, it accelerates, and transfers energy to the runner. Water pressure decreases to atmospheric, or in some cases subatmospheric, as the water passes through the turbine blades and loses energy.\n\nAround 1890, the modern [[fluid bearing]] was invented, now universally used to support heavy water turbine spindles.  As of 2002, fluid bearings appear to have a [[mean time between failures]] of more than 1300 years.\n\nAround 1913, [[Viktor Kaplan]] created the [[Kaplan turbine]], a propeller-type machine. It was an evolution of the Francis turbine and revolutionized the ability to develop low-head hydro sites.\n\n=== New concept ===\n[[File:Pelton wheel (patent).png|thumb|right|Figure from Pelton's original patent (October 1880)]]\n{{Main|Pelton wheel}}\n\nAll common water machines until the late 19th century (including water wheels) were basically reaction machines; water ''pressure'' head acted on the machine and produced work.  A reaction turbine needs to fully contain the water during energy transfer.\n\nIn 1866, California millwright Samuel Knight invented a machine that took the impulse system to a new level.<ref>W. A. Doble, ''The Tangential Water Wheel'', Transactions of the American Institute of Mining Engineers, Vol. XXIX, 1899.</ref><ref>W. F. Durrand, ''The Pelton Water Wheel'', Stanford University, Mechanical Engineering, 1939.</ref> Inspired by the high pressure jet systems used in hydraulic mining in the gold fields, Knight developed a bucketed wheel which captured the energy of a free jet, which had converted a high head (hundreds of vertical feet in a pipe or [[penstock]]) of water to kinetic energy. This is called an impulse or tangential turbine. The water's velocity, roughly twice the velocity of the bucket periphery, does a U-turn in the bucket and drops out of the runner at low velocity.\n\nIn 1879, [[Lester Allan Pelton|Lester Pelton]], experimenting with a Knight Wheel, developed a [[Pelton wheel]] (double bucket design), which exhausted the water to the side, eliminating some energy loss of the Knight wheel which exhausted some water back against the center of the wheel. In about 1895, William Doble improved on Pelton's half-cylindrical bucket form with an elliptical bucket that included  a cut in it to allow the jet a cleaner bucket entry. This is the modern form of the Pelton turbine which today achieves up to 92% efficiency. Pelton had been quite an effective promoter of his design and although Doble took over the Pelton company he did not change the name to Doble because it had brand name recognition.\n\n[[Turgo turbine|Turgo]] and [[cross-flow turbine]]s were later impulse designs.\n\n== Theory of operation ==\nFlowing water is directed on to the blades of a turbine runner, creating a force on the blades. Since the runner is spinning, the force acts through a distance (force acting through a distance is the definition of  [[Mechanical work|work]]). In this way, energy is transferred from the water flow to the turbine.\n\nWater turbines are divided into two groups: [[reaction (physics)|reaction]] turbines and [[Impulse (physics)|impulse]] turbines.\n\nThe precise shape of water turbine blades is a function of the supply pressure of water, and the type of impeller selected.\n\n=== Reaction turbines ===\nReaction turbines are acted on by water, which changes pressure as it moves through the turbine and gives up its energy. They must be encased to contain the water pressure (or suction), or they must be fully submerged in the water flow.\n\n[[Newton's laws of motion#Newton's third law|Newton's third law]] describes the transfer of energy for reaction turbines.\n\nMost water turbines in use are reaction turbines and are used in low (<{{convert|30|m|sigfig=1|disp=or|abbr=on}}) and medium ({{convert|30|-|300|m|sigfig=1|disp=or|abbr=on}}) head applications.\nIn reaction turbine pressure drop occurs in both fixed and moving blades.\nIt is largely used in dam and large power plants\n\n=== Impulse turbines ===\nImpulse turbines change the velocity of a water jet. The jet pushes on the turbine's curved blades which changes the direction of the flow. The resulting change in momentum ([[Impulse (physics)|impulse]]) causes a force on the turbine blades. Since the turbine is spinning, the force acts through a distance (work) and the diverted water flow is left with diminished energy. An impulse turbine is one in which the pressure of the fluid flowing over the rotor blades is constant and all the work output is due to the change in kinetic energy of the fluid.\n\nPrior to hitting the turbine blades, the water's pressure ([[potential energy]]) is converted to kinetic energy by a [[nozzle]] and focused on the turbine. No pressure change occurs at the turbine blades, and the turbine doesn't require a housing for operation.\n\nNewton's second law describes the transfer of energy for impulse turbines.\n\nImpulse turbines are often used in very high (>300m/1000&nbsp;ft) head applications.\n\n=== Power ===\nThe [[Power (physics)|power]] available in a stream of water is;\n\n<math>P=\\eta\\cdot\\rho\\cdot g\\cdot h\\cdot\\dot q</math>\n\nwhere:\n\n*<math>P=</math>     power (J/s or watts)\n*<math>\\eta=</math>  turbine efficiency\n*<math>\\rho=</math>  density of water (kg/m\u00b3)\n*<math>g=</math>     acceleration of gravity (9.81&nbsp;m/s\u00b2)\n*<math>h=</math>     head (m). For still water, this is the difference in height between the inlet and outlet surfaces. Moving water has an additional component added to account for the kinetic energy of the flow. The total head equals the ''pressure head'' plus ''velocity head''.\n*<math>\\dot q</math>= flow rate (m\u00b3/s)\n\n=== Pumped-storage hydroelectricity ===\nSome water turbines are designed for pumped-storage hydroelectricity. They can reverse flow and operate as a [[pump]]<ref name=\"Roman helix-turbine mill\" /> to fill a high reservoir during off-peak electrical hours, and then revert to a water turbine for power generation during peak electrical demand. This type of turbine is usually a [[Deriaz turbine|Deriaz]] or [[Francis turbine]] in design.\n\nThis type of system is used in El Hierro, one of the Canary Islands: \"When wind production exceeds demand, excess energy will pump water from a lower reservoir at the bottom of a volcanic cone to an upper reservoir at the top of the volcano 700 meters above sea level. The lower reservoir stores 150,000 cubic meters of water. The stored water acts as a battery. The maximum storage capacity is 270 MWh. When demand rises and there is not enough wind power, the water will be released to four hydroelectric turbines with a total capacity of 11 MW.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.greenbiz.com/blog/2014/03/03/how-small-spanish-island-became-renewable-energy-pioneer-el-hierro|title=How a small Spanish island became a renewable energy pioneer|first=Laurie|last=Guevara-Stone|date=3 March 2014|website=greenbiz.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://euanmearns.com/an-independent-evaluation-of-the-el-hierro-wind-pumped-hydro-system/|title=An Independent Evaluation of the El Hierro Wind & Pumped Hydro System|first=Benjamin|last=Jargstorf|date=23 February 2017|website=euanmearns.com/}}</ref>\n\n=== Efficiency ===\nLarge modern water turbines operate at [[mechanical efficiency|mechanical efficiencies]] greater than 90%.\n\n== Types of water turbines ==\n[[File:Water turbine runners.jpg|thumb|right|Various types of water turbine runners. From left to right: Pelton wheel, two types of Francis turbine and Kaplan turbine.]]\n\nReaction turbines:\n*[[VLH turbine]]\n*[[Francis turbine]]\n*[[Kaplan turbine]]\n*[[Tyson turbine]]\n*[[Deriaz turbine]]\n*[[Gorlov helical turbine]]\n\nImpulse turbine\n*[[Water wheel]]\n*[[Pelton wheel]]\n*[[Turgo turbine]]\n*[[Cross-flow turbine]] (also known as the B\u00e1nki-Michell turbine, or Ossberger turbine)\n*[[Jonval turbine]]\n*[[Reverse overshot water-wheel]]\n*[[Screw turbine]]\n* Barkh Turbine\n\n== Design and application ==\n[[File:Water Turbine Chart.png|right|350px]]\n\nTurbine selection is based on the available water head, and less so on the available flow rate.  In general, impulse turbines are used for high head sites, and reaction turbines are used for [[Low head hydro power|low head]] sites. Kaplan turbines with adjustable blade pitch are well-adapted to wide ranges of flow or head conditions, since their peak efficiency can be achieved over a wide range of flow conditions.\n\nSmall turbines (mostly under 10 MW) may have horizontal shafts, and even fairly large bulb-type turbines up to 100 MW or so may be horizontal.  Very large Francis and Kaplan machines usually have vertical shafts because this  makes best use of the available head, and makes installation of a generator more economical.  Pelton wheels may be either vertical or horizontal shaft machines because the size of the machine is so much less than the available head.   Some impulse turbines use multiple jets per runner to balance shaft thrust.  This also allows for the use of a smaller turbine runner, which can decrease costs and mechanical losses.\n\n=== Typical range of heads ===\n<div style=\"width:400px;\">\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-break}}\n\u2022 [[Water wheel]]<br/>\n\u2022 [[Screw turbine]]<br/>\n\u2022 [[VLH turbine]]<br/>\n\u2022 [[Kaplan turbine]]<br/>\n\u2022 [[Francis turbine]]<br/>\n\u2022 [[Pelton wheel]]<br/>\n\u2022 [[Turgo turbine]]<br/>\n{{col-break}}\n0.2 < ''H'' < 4 &nbsp;&nbsp;(''H'' = head in m)<br/>\n1 < ''H'' < 10<br/>\n1.5 < ''H'' < 4.5<br/>\n2 < ''H'' < 70<br/>\n10 < ''H'' < 300<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.alstom.com/power/renewables/hydro/hydro-turbines/francis-turbines/|title=Francis hydro turbines|author=|date=|website=alstom.com}}</ref><br/>\n80 < ''H'' < 1600<br/>\n50 < ''H'' < 250\n{{col-end}}\n</div>\n\n=== Specific speed ===\n{{Main|Specific speed}}\n\nThe specific speed <math> n_s </math> of a turbine characterizes the turbine's shape in a way that is not related to its size. This allows a new turbine design to be scaled from an existing design of known performance. The specific speed is also the main criteria for matching a specific hydro site with the correct turbine type.\nThe specific speed is the speed with which the turbine turns for a particular discharge Q, with unit head and thereby is able to produce unit power.\n\n=== Affinity laws ===\n[[Affinity laws]] allow the output of a turbine to be predicted based on model tests.  A miniature replica of a proposed design, about one foot (0.3 m) in diameter, can be tested and the laboratory measurements applied to the final application with high confidence. Affinity laws are derived by requiring [[similitude (model)|similitude]] between the test model and the application.\n\nFlow through the turbine is controlled either by a large valve or by wicket gates arranged around the outside of the turbine runner.  Differential head and flow can be plotted for a number of different values of gate opening, producing a hill diagram used to show the efficiency of the turbine at varying conditions.\n\n=== Runaway speed ===\nThe '''runaway speed''' of a water turbine is its speed at full flow, and no shaft load. The turbine will be designed to survive the mechanical forces of this speed. The manufacturer will supply the runaway speed rating.\n\n== Control systems ==\n[[File:From Turbine to Line Shaft.webm|thumb|Operation of a [[flyball governor]] to control speeds of a water turbine]]\n\nDifferent designs of [[Governor (device)|governors]] have been used since the mid-18th century to control the speeds of the water turbines. A variety of [[centrifugal governor|flyball]] systems, or first-generation governors, were used during the first 100 years of water turbine speed controls. In early flyball systems, the flyball component countered by a spring acted directly to the valve of the turbine or the [[wicket gate]] to control the amount of water that enters the turbines. Newer systems with mechanical governors started around 1880. An early mechanical governor is a [[servomechanism]] that comprises a series of gears that use the turbine's speed to drive the flyball and turbine's power to drive the control mechanism. The mechanical governors were continued to be enhanced in power amplification through the use of gears and the dynamic behavior. By 1930, the mechanical governors had many parameters that could be set on the feedback system for precise controls. In the later part of the twentieth century, electronic governors and digital systems started to replace the mechanical governors. In the electronic governors, also known as second-generation governors, the flyball was replaced by rotational speed [[sensor]] but the controls were still done through [[Analog device|analog]] systems. In the modern systems, also known as third-generation governors, the controls are performed digitally by [[algorithm]]s that are programmed to the computer of the governor.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Fasol|first1=Karl Heinz|title=A Short History of Hydropower Control|journal=IEEE Control Systems Magazine|date=August 2002|pages=68\u201376|url=http://ieeecss.org/CSM/library/2002/aug02/04-HistoricalPerspectives.pdf|accessdate=29 January 2015}}</ref>\n\n== Turbine blade materials ==\nGiven that the turbine blades in a water turbine are constantly exposed to water and dynamic forces, they need to have high corrosion resistance and strength. The most common material used in overlays on carbon steel runners in water turbines are austenitic steel alloys that have 17% to 20% chromium to increase stability of the film which improves aqueous corrosion resistance. The chromium content in these steel alloys exceed the minimum of 12% chromium required to exhibit some atmospheric corrosion resistance. Having a higher chromium concentration in the steel alloys allows for a much longer lifespan of the turbine blades. Currently, the blades are made of martensitic stainless steels which have high strength compared to austenitic stainless steels by a factor of 2.<ref name=\"Spicher\">{{ Citation\n | last = Spicher\n | first = Thomas\n | author-link = Thomas Spicher\n | year = 2013\n | title = Choosing the Right Material for Turbine Runners\n | periodical = Hydro Review\n | volume = 32\n | issue = 6\n}}</ref> Besides corrosion resistance and strength as the criteria for material selection, weld-ability and density of the turbine blade.  Greater weld-ability allows for easier repair of the turbine blades. This also allows for higher weld quality which results in a better repair. Selecting a material with low density is important to achieve higher efficiency because the lighter blades rotate more easily. The most common material used in Kaplan Turbine blades are stainless steel alloys (SS). The martensitic stainless steel alloys have high strength, thinner sections than standard carbon steel, and reduced mass that enhances the hydrodynamic flow conditions and efficiency of the water turbine.<ref name=\"Spicher\" /> The SS(13Cr-4Ni) has been shown to have improved erosion resistance at all angles of attack through the process of laser hardening.<ref>{{ Citation\n | last1 = Padhy\n | first1 = M.\n | last2 = Senapati\n | first2 = P.\n | year = 2015\n | title = Turbine Blade Materials Used For The Power Plants Exposed to High Silt Erosion- A Review\n | periodical = ICHPSD\n}}</ref> It is important to minimize erosion in order to maintain high efficiencies because erosion negatively impacts the hydraulic profile of the blades which reduces the relative ease to rotate.<ref>{{ Citation\n | last = Gummer\n | first = John\n | author-link = John Gummer\n | year = 2009\n | title = Combating Silt Erosion in Hydraulic Turbines\n | periodical = Hydro Review\n | volume = 17\n | issue = 1\n}}</ref>\n\n== Maintenance ==\n[[File:Turbine Francis Worn.JPG|thumb|left|A [[Francis turbine]] at the end of its life showing [[pitting corrosion]], [[Fatigue (material)|fatigue cracking]] and a catastrophic failure. Earlier repair jobs that used stainless steel weld rods are visible.]]\n\nTurbines are designed to run for decades with very little maintenance of the main elements; overhaul intervals are on the order of several years. Maintenance of the runners and parts exposed to water include removal, inspection, and repair of worn parts.\n\nNormal wear and tear includes [[pitting corrosion]] from [[cavitation]], [[Fatigue (material)|fatigue cracking]], and [[Abrasive|abrasion]] from suspended solids in the water. Steel elements are repaired by welding, usually with [[stainless steel]] rods. Damaged areas are cut or ground out, then welded back up to their original or an improved profile. Old turbine runners may have a significant amount of stainless steel added this way by the end of their lifetime. Elaborate [[welding]] procedures may be used to achieve the highest quality repairs.<ref>Cline, Roger:[http://www.usbr.gov/power/data/fist/fist2_7/fist2-7.pdf ''Mechanical Overhaul Procedures for Hydroelectric Units (Facilities Instructions, Standards, and Techniques, Volume 2-7)'']; United States Department of the Interior Bureau of Reclamation, Denver, Colorado, July 1994 (800KB pdf).</ref>\n\nOther elements requiring inspection and repair during overhauls include [[Bearing (mechanical)|bearings]], packing box and shaft sleeves, servomotors, cooling systems for the bearings and generator coils, seal rings, wicket gate linkage elements and all surfaces.<ref>United States Department of the Interior Bureau of Reclamation; Duncan, William (revised April 1989): [http://www.usbr.gov/power/data/fist/fist2_5/vol2-5.pdf ''Turbine Repair (Facilities Instructions, Standards & Techniques, Volume 2-5)''] (1.5 MB pdf).</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n== Environmental impact ==\n{{Main|Environmental impacts of reservoirs}}\n[[File:Central hidroel\u00e9ctrica de Walchensee, Kochel, Baviera, Alemania, 2014-03-22, DD 04.JPG|thumb|[[Walchensee Hydroelectric Power Station]] in [[Bavaria]], Germany, has been in operation since 1924]]\nWater turbines are generally considered a clean power producer, as the turbine causes essentially no change to the water. They use a renewable energy source and are designed to operate for decades. They produce significant amounts of the world's electrical supply.\n\nHistorically there have also been negative consequences, mostly associated with the dams normally required for power production.  Dams alter the natural ecology of rivers, potentially killing fish, stopping [[Fish migration|migrations]], and disrupting peoples' livelihoods. For example, [[American Indians in the United States|Native American]] tribes in the [[Pacific Northwest]] had livelihoods built around [[salmon]] [[fishing]], but aggressive dam-building destroyed their way of life. Dams also cause less obvious, but potentially serious consequences, including increased evaporation of water (especially in arid regions), buildup of [[silt]] behind the dam, and changes to water temperature and flow patterns. In the [[United States]], it is now illegal to block the migration of fish, for example the [[white sturgeon]] in [[North America]], so [[fish ladder]]s must be provided by dam builders.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Commons category|Water turbines|Water Turbines}}\n\n* [[Archimedes' screw]]\n* [[Hydroelectricity]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Notes==\n*Robert Sackett, Preservationist, PRSHPO (Original 1990 draft).
