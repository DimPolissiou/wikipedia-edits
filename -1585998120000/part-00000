The NSE was established in 1992 as the first dematerialized electronic exchange in the country. NSE was the first exchange in the country to provide a modern, fully automated screen-based electronic trading system which offered easy trading facility to the investors spread across the length and breadth of the country. Vikram Limaye is Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer of NSE.\n\nNational Stock Exchange has a total [[market capitalization]] of more than {{USD}}2.27 trillion, making it [[List of stock exchanges#Major stock exchanges|the world's 11th-largest stock exchange]] as of April 2018.<ref name=\"WFE\">{{cite web|url=https://www.world-exchanges.org/home/index.php/monthly-reports-tool|title=Monthly Reports - World Federation of Exchanges|publisher=WFE}}</ref> NSE's flagship index, the [[NIFTY 50]], the 50 stock index is used extensively by investors in India and around the world as a barometer of the Indian capital markets.

Of these only 7,800 companies are listed of which only 4000 trade on the stock exchanges at [[BSE SENSEX|BSE]] and '''NSE'''. Hence the stocks trading at the [[BSE SENSEX|BSE]] and '''NSE''' account for only around 4% of the [[Indian economy]], which derives most of its income-related activity from the so-called unorganized sector and households.<ref name=\"vaid\">{{cite web|title=National economic debate - Stock markets or rigged casinos - talk by Professor Dr. R.

The price information which could earlier be accessed only by a handful of people could now be seen by a client in a remote location with the same ease. The paper-based settlement was replaced by electronic depository-based accounts and settlement of trades was always done on time. One of the most critical changes was that a robust risk management system was set in place, so that settlement guarantees could protect investors against [[broker]] defaults.\n\nNSE was set up by a group of leading Indian financial institutions at the behest of the government of India to bring transparency to the Indian capital market. Based on the recommendations laid out by the Pherwani committee, NSE has been established with a diversified shareholding comprising domestic and global investors. The key domestic investors include [[Life Insurance Corporation of India]], [[State Bank of India]], [[IFCI]] Limited, [[IDFC]] Limited and [[Stock Holding Corporation of India Limited]]. And the key global investors are Gagil FDI Limited, GS Strategic Investments Limited, SAIF II SE Investments Mauritius Limited, Aranda Investments (Mauritius) Pte Limited and PI Opportunities Fund I.<ref>{{cite web|title=NSE Shareholding Pattern (For the quarter ended on September 30, 2014)|url=http://www.nseindia.com/global/content/about_us/NSEIL_SHP_30092014.pdf|website=/www.nseindia.com|publisher=National Stock Exchange of India Limited|accessdate=7 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe exchange was incorporated in 1992 as a tax-paying company and was recognized as a stock exchange in 1993 under the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956, when [[P. V. Narasimha Rao]] was the Prime Minister of India and [[Manmohan Singh]] was the Finance Minister. NSE commenced operations in the Wholesale Debt Market (WDM) segment in June 1994. The capital market (equities) segment of the NSE commenced operations in November 1994, while operations in the derivatives segment commenced in June 2000. NSE offers trading, clearing and settlement services in equity, equity derivatives, debt, commodity derivatives, and currency derivatives segments. It was the first exchange in India to introduce an electronic trading facility thus connecting together the investor base of the entire country. NSE has 2500 VSATs and 3000 leased lines spread over more than 2000 cities across India.\n\nNSE was also instrumental in creating the [[National Securities Depository Limited]] (NSDL) which allows investors to securely hold and transfer their shares and bonds electronically. It also allows investors to hold and [[trade]] in as few as one share or bond. This not only made holding financial instruments convenient but more importantly, eliminated the need for paper certificates and greatly reduced the incidents of forged or fake certificates and fraudulent transactions that had plagued the Indian stock market. The NSDL's security, combined with the transparency, lower transaction prices and efficiency that NSE offered, greatly increased the attractiveness of the Indian stock market to domestic and international investors.\n\n=== NSE EMERGE ===\n{{about|National Stock Exchange of India|NSE EMERGE|NSE EMERGE}}\nNSE EMERGE is NSE\u2019s new initiative for SME & Startup companies from India.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.businesstoday.in/markets/company-stock/nse-sme-exchange/story/188197.html|title=NSE launches SME exchange with first listing- Business News|website=www.businesstoday.in|access-date=2019-10-07}}</ref> These companies can get listed on NSE without Initial Public Offer (IPO).

NSE is the first Indian exchange to launch global indices. This is also the first time in the world that futures contracts on the S&P 500 index were introduced and listed on an exchange outside of their home country, USA. The new contracts include futures on both the DJIA and the S&P 500 and options on the S&P 500.\n\nOn 3 May 2012, the National Stock exchange launched derivative contracts (futures and options) on FTSE 100, the widely tracked index of the UK equity stock market. This was the first of its kind of an index of the UK equity stock market launched in India. FTSE 100 includes 100 largest UK listed blue chip companies and has given returns of 17.8 per cent on investment over three years.

Investors will therefore not face any currency risk, because they will not have to invest in dollar denominated or rupee denominated contracts.\n\n;\n\nIn August 2008, currency derivatives were introduced in India with the launch of Currency Futures in USD\u2013INR by NSE. It also added currency futures in Euros, Pounds, and Yen. The average daily turnover in the F&O Segment of the Exchange on 20 June 2013 stood at {{INRConvert|419.2616|b}} in futures and {{INRConvert|273.977|b}} in options, respectively.\n\n=== Interest Rate Futures ===\nIn December 2013, exchanges in India received approval from market regulator SEBI for launching interest rate futures (IRFs) on a single GOI bond or a basket of bonds that will be cash settled. Market participants have been in favour of the product being cash settled and being available on a single bond. NSE will launch the NSE Bond Futures on 21 January on highly liquid 7.16 percent and 8.83 percent 10-year GOI bonds. Interest Rate Futures were introduced for the first time in India by NSE on 31 August 2009, exactly one year after the launch of Currency Futures. NSE became the first stock exchange to get an approval for interest-rate futures, as recommended by the SEBI-RBI committee.\n\n=== Debt Market ===\nOn 13 May 2013, NSE launched India's first dedicated debt platform to provide a liquid and transparent trading platform for debt related products.<ref>[http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/markets/stock-markets/nse-launches-debt-trading-platform/article4711255.ece NSE launches debt trading platform | Business Line].

The NSE was established in 1992 as the first dematerialized electronic exchange in the country. NSE was the first exchange in the country to provide a modern, fully automated screen-based electronic trading system which offered easy trading facility to the investors spread across the length and breadth of the country. Vikram Limaye is Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer of NSE.\n\nNational Stock Exchange has a total [[market capitalization]] of more than {{USD}}2.27 trillion, making it [[List of stock exchanges#Major stock exchanges|the world's 11th-largest stock exchange]] as of April 2018.<ref name=\"WFE\">{{cite web|url=https://www.world-exchanges.org/home/index.php/monthly-reports-tool|title=Monthly Reports - World Federation of Exchanges|publisher=WFE}}</ref> NSE's flagship index, the [[NIFTY 50]], the 50 stock index is used extensively by investors in India and around the world as a barometer of the Indian capital markets. Nifty 50 index was launched in 1996 by the NSE.<ref>https://www.nseindia.com/global/content/about_us/history_milestones.htm</ref> However, Vaidyanathan (2016) estimates that only about 4% of the Indian economy / GDP is actually derived from the stock exchanges in India.<ref name=\"vaid\"/>\n\nUnlike countries like the United States where nearly 70% of the [[GDP]] is derived from larger companies and the [[corporate]] sector, the corporate sector in India accounts for only 12-14% of the national GDP (as of October 2016). Of these only 7,800 companies are listed of which only 4000 trade on the stock exchanges at [[BSE SENSEX|BSE]] and '''NSE'''. Hence the stocks trading at the [[BSE SENSEX|BSE]] and '''NSE''' account for only around 4% of the [[Indian economy]], which derives most of its income-related activity from the so-called unorganized sector and households.<ref name=\"vaid\">{{cite web|title=National economic debate - Stock markets or rigged casinos - talk by Professor Dr. R.

The price information which could earlier be accessed only by a handful of people could now be seen by a client in a remote location with the same ease. The paper-based settlement was replaced by electronic depository-based accounts and settlement of trades was always done on time. One of the most critical changes was that a robust risk management system was set in place, so that settlement guarantees could protect investors against [[broker]] defaults.\n\nNSE was set up by a group of leading Indian financial institutions at the behest of the government of India to bring transparency to the Indian capital market. Based on the recommendations laid out by the Pherwani committee, NSE has been established with a diversified shareholding comprising domestic and global investors. The key domestic investors include [[Life Insurance Corporation of India]], [[State Bank of India]], [[IFCI]] Limited, [[IDFC]] Limited and [[Stock Holding Corporation of India Limited]]. And the key global investors are Gagil FDI Limited, GS Strategic Investments Limited, SAIF II SE Investments Mauritius Limited, Aranda Investments (Mauritius) Pte Limited and PI Opportunities Fund I.<ref>{{cite web|title=NSE Shareholding Pattern (For the quarter ended on September 30, 2014)|url=http://www.nseindia.com/global/content/about_us/NSEIL_SHP_30092014.pdf|website=/www.nseindia.com|publisher=National Stock Exchange of India Limited|accessdate=7 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe exchange was incorporated in 1992 as a tax-paying company and was recognized as a stock exchange in 1993 under the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956, when [[P. V. Narasimha Rao]] was the Prime Minister of India and [[Manmohan Singh]] was the Finance Minister. NSE commenced operations in the Wholesale Debt Market (WDM) segment in June 1994. The capital market (equities) segment of the NSE commenced operations in November 1994, while operations in the derivatives segment commenced in June 2000. NSE offers trading, clearing and settlement services in equity, equity derivatives, debt, commodity derivatives, and currency derivatives segments. It was the first exchange in India to introduce an electronic trading facility thus connecting together the investor base of the entire country. NSE has 2500 VSATs and 3000 leased lines spread over more than 2000 cities across India.\n\nNSE was also instrumental in creating the [[National Securities Depository Limited]] (NSDL) which allows investors to securely hold and transfer their shares and bonds electronically. It also allows investors to hold and [[trade]] in as few as one share or bond. This not only made holding financial instruments convenient but more importantly, eliminated the need for paper certificates and greatly reduced the incidents of forged or fake certificates and fraudulent transactions that had plagued the Indian stock market. The NSDL's security, combined with the transparency, lower transaction prices and efficiency that NSE offered, greatly increased the attractiveness of the Indian stock market to domestic and international investors.\n\n=== NSE EMERGE ===\n{{about|National Stock Exchange of India|NSE EMERGE|NSE EMERGE}}\nNSE EMERGE is NSE\u2019s new initiative for SME & Startup companies from India.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.businesstoday.in/markets/company-stock/nse-sme-exchange/story/188197.html|title=NSE launches SME exchange with first listing- Business News|website=www.businesstoday.in|access-date=2019-10-07}}</ref> These companies can get listed on NSE without Initial Public Offer (IPO).

NSE is the first Indian exchange to launch global indices. This is also the first time in the world that futures contracts on the S&P 500 index were introduced and listed on an exchange outside of their home country, USA. The new contracts include futures on both the DJIA and the S&P 500 and options on the S&P 500.\n\nOn 3 May 2012, the National Stock exchange launched derivative contracts (futures and options) on FTSE 100, the widely tracked index of the UK equity stock market.

His oeuvre, which spans five decades, began with the documentary photography field but evolved into the creation of distinctive fictionalized realms that also integrate the mediums of film, installation, theatre, sculpture, painting and drawing. Marginalized people, animals, found objects, wires and childlike drawings inhabit the unlocatable worlds presented in Ballen's artworks.

His father was an attorney and the founding partner of McLaughlin, Stern. His mother was a member of the famous photo agency Magnum from 1963 to 1967 prior to opening the Photography House Gallery with Inge Bondi in New York City in 1968. Ballen became acquainted with the photographs of [[Andr\u00e9 Kert\u00e9sz|Andre Kertesz,]] [[Edward Steichen]], [[Paul Strand]], [[Elliot Erwitt]], [[Bruce Davidson (photographer)|Bruce Davidson]] and [[Henri Cartier-Bresson]] either from published photographs in albums or through personal acquaintance. He attended Scarborough School, New York, and went to Camp Stinson during his childhood summers. At age 13, he received his first camera, and was soon after employed for a first commercial job of photographing McDonald's, Mamaroneck, New York. Ballen was interested in the realism of Rembrandt from a young age, and was drawn to photographing elderly men. He recalls that one of the most \u201cvivid and pivotal moment[s] in his life occurred in 1968 when [his] parents gave him a Nikon FTn camera for [his] high school graduation. On the very same day [he] went to the outskirts of Sing Sing Prison near New York city to take photographs\u201d.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Ballenesque|last=Ballen|first=Roger|publisher=Thames and Hudson|year=2017|isbn=978-0500519691|location=London|pages=17}}</ref>\n\nHe later studied psychology at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], which was an epicenter for the 1960s counter-culture. Here, he was exposed to [[R. D. Laing]]'s anti-psychiatry movement, Jung's concept of the [[Collective unconscious|\"collective unconscious\"]], the [[Theatre of the Absurd]] ([[Harold Pinter|Pinter]], [[Beckett]] and [[Eug\u00e8ne Ionesco|Ionesco]]) and existential philosophers, such as [[Jean-Paul Sartre|Sartre]] and [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]], all of which came to be formative in the development of his artistic style. During the summer of 1969, he photographed [[Woodstock]], a series which was published in the ''New York Times'' 50th anniversary of the iconic music festival. Ballen notes that capturing Woodstock \u201cplayed a role in [his] getting to know the human experience, human endeavour, finding the moment, working with people, searching in difficult circumstances for something that stood out. If I had to say what are important aspects that run through the work, it\u2019s trying to come to terms with pure chaos.\u201d<ref name=\"Wender 2019\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/06/arts/music/roger-ballen-photos-woodstock.html|title=Woodstock at 50: Roger Ballen Revisits His Never-Before-Published Woodstock Photos|last=Wender|first=Jessie|date=2019|website=New York Times|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Ballen made his first film ''Ill Wind'' after completing a course in film making in 1972.\n\nAfter the death of his mother Adrienne in 1973, he, like many of the counter-culture, developed existential longing in response aversion to the materialism of Western society and his suburban upbringing. He spent the subsequent five months Art Students of League of New York. Here, he painted [[Outsider art|art brut]], [[Primitivism|primitivist]], paintings, that according to his teacher, \u201cbelonged in the Stone Age\u201d.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Ballen|first=Roger|title=Ballenesque, Roger Ballen: A Retrospective|publisher=Thames and Hudson|year=2017|isbn=978-0500519691|location=London|pages=2010}}</ref> In the autumn of 1973, yearning to find Conrad's \u201cheart of darkness\u201d and Eastern nirvana, he left embarked on a five-year journey, that would take him by land from Cairo to Cape Town; Istanbul to New Guinea (1973-1978). On this trip, he continued an ongoing interest in taking pictures of enigmatic men against dramatic surfaces of shrines, temples and markets. He also began a series of \u2018field photographs' of streets, earthen paths or walls (inspired by the [[Color field|colour field]] painting movement) and developed an interest in observing the life of young boys. He kept Kodak Tri-X or Plus X film a green canvas knapsack which he would tie to his legs during meals or overnight train rides or tied to hotel bedposts. He processed the film and would send it to his father in New York.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Ballenesque|last=Ballen|first=Roger|publisher=Thames and Hudson|year=2017|isbn=978-0500519691|location=London|pages=15\u201325}}</ref>\n\nOn this trip, he arrived in South Africa, where he met his future wife, an artist, paper-maker and art teacher, Lynda Moross, whom he married in 1980, and had twins, Amanda and Paul, in 1989. These travels also spurred on his first photographic book entitled ''Boyhood,'' which was an series of universal, iconic images of boys that Ballen had encountered while seeking to recreate his childhood in the adventure of travel.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rogerballen.com/articles/ballenesque-an-insight-into-the-life-and-work-of-roger-ballen/|title=Ballenesque: An insight into the life and work of Roger Ballen|last=Pete|first=Littlewood|date=2018|website=Roger Ballen Photographer|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Disillusioned by the idea of commercial photography, Ballen enrolled at the [[Colorado School of Mines]] in 1978, where he received in PhD in Mineral Economics in 1981. He permanently settled in Johannesburg in 1982, where he worked as a self-employed mining entrepreneur until 2010. This profession took him into the South African countryside in which he travelled to remote small villages called \u201cdorps\u201d and rural areas referred to as the \u201cplatteland\u201d, in which he photographed the marginalized whites who once privileged from Apartheid, but who were now isolated and economically deprived.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Ballenesque|last=Ballen|first=Roger|publisher=Thames and Hudson|year=2017|isbn=978-0500519691|location=London|pages=75}}</ref> During this time, he worked closely with his master printer and friend, Dennis da Silva. After 1994, he no longer looked to the countryside for his subject matter, finding it closer to home in Johannesburg, where he continues to work. Since 2007, he has worked closely with his art director, Marguerite Rossouw.\n\nIn 2018, Ballen received an Honorary Doctorate in Art and Design from Kingston University. In 2008, the Roger Ballen Foundation was founded to promote the advancement of education of photography in Africa. From April 2020, it will be housed in the Roger Ballen Centre for Photographic Art, Forest Town, Johannesburg.\n\n== \"Ballenesque\" Aesthetic ==\nBallen's early street photography and the psychological portraiture of ''Boyhood, Dorps'' and ''Platteland'' was influenced by the work of [[Henri Cartier-Bresson|Cartier Bresson]], [[Walker Evans]], [[Diane Arbus]] and [[Elliott Erwitt|Elliot Erwitt]]. The distinctive \u201cBallenesque\u201d style of his documentary fiction (from 2000 onward), has been said to reference the artistic genres of [[Theatre of the Absurd|absurdist theatre]], [[outsider art]], [[Outsider art|art brut]], [[Na\u00efve art|naivism]], photographic [[surrealism]] and the photographic grotesque. He has also said to have been influenced by a wide range of other literary artistic/philosophical work, such as that of Beckett, [[Franz Kafka|Kafka]], [[Carl Jung|Jung]] and [[Antonin Artaud|Artaud.]]\n\nRobert Young coins the term \u201cBallenesque\u201d to refer to the unique qualities of Ballen's work that mark and identify it as his own. Young identifies four elements, that, in their \u201cvarious shifting combinations and relations, together make up the constituent factors of the -esque factor.\u201d<ref>{{Cite book|title=Ballenesque|last=Young|first=Robert|publisher=Thames and Hudson|year=2017|isbn=978-0500545218|location=London|pages=18}}</ref> These include:\n\n=== Prehensile Portraits of the \u201cUnderprivileged\u201d ===\nAlthough present as Ballen's work has evolved, the presence of the marginalized subject is a feature of much of the artist's earlier work. Ballen has emphasized his works do not have a sociopolitical agenda; they rather make a psychological and aesthetic statement . He has also stressed that these subjects are not anonymous; he has developed close friendships with them over the course of the history of working with them:<blockquote>\u201cFor many of the people I have worked with over the years, the bond we established while working together, gave them a sense of purpose and meaning. On a typical day, I might receive twenty or thirty phone messages, some asking me when I am going to visit next, some making requests for food or medicine, and others reminding me that it is someone\u2019s birthday. In a single day, I can be a doctor, a lawyer, a priest and a social worker.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Ballenesque|last=Ballen|first=Roger|publisher=Thames and Hudson|year=2017|isbn=978-0500545218|location=London|pages=203}}</ref></blockquote>For Young, however, the distinctiveness of these photographs does not lie in the mere documenting of these \u201cothers\u201d, but rather, by the fact that these subjects are captured in such a way that they feel they \u201clook back\u201d at the spectator. Ballen's square format, shallow depth of field and space, confronts the viewer with a closeness to, and simultaneous inaccessibility of these people, who often seem to have \u201cpsychic disturbance\u201d. This remoteness is cultivated by the way in which they do not leave their often bizarre, domestic or theatrical, mysterious settings. For Young, that we cannot engage in empathy, sympathy or self-discovery; we merely submit to looking at their \u201ctransfixing gaze\u201d.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Ballenesque|last=Ballen|first=Roger|publisher=Thames and Hudson|year=2017|isbn=978-0500545218|location=London|pages=8\u20139}}</ref>\n\n=== Windowless Walls ===\nThis \u201cremoteness\u201d of the places of these inaccessible subjects is evoked because the spaces in which they appear are otherworldly\u2014they exist in the realm of the photograph but do not seem to reference actual locations in everyday reality. Young writes: \u201cthere is no world that we can reference here.\u201d Ballen's use of black-and-white photography up until 2018, contributes powerfully to this transformation. He writes: \u201cBlack-and-white is a very minimalist art form and unlike color photographs does not pretend to mimic the world in a manner similar to the way the human eye might perceive. Black-and-white is essentially an abstract way to interpret and transform what one might refer to as reality.\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lensculture.com/roger-ballen|title=Roger Ballen Video Interview: Disturbing Visions from the Dark Side|last=Ballen|first=Roger|date=|website=LensCulture|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nYoung further notes that the claustrophobic two-dimensional planes of the photograph itself are inscribed with drawings, marks and lines. From the early 90s onward, they appear in Ballen's photographs in wire (antenna lines electrical cords, twisted cable, baling wire, woven fence, coat hangers and snippets of anonymous strands). These mysterious closed rooms have been referred to by Ballen as \u201cvisual embodiments\u201d of the \u2018place\u2019 of the subconscious mind, and as set in which people and animals present themselves and interact with objects and drawings; moments preserved by the stillness of the photograph.\n\nHe also emphasizes that these worlds are an ''artistic'' reality, in which there is a conversation and interaction of visual elements to create formal harmony. Ballen seems concise form and complex meaning in his images. He writes: \u201cIt\u2019s not so much a matter of content; it\u2019s also a matter of form. I am first and foremost a formalist. I always say that the form comes before the meaning. Before I think about the picture; before I think about pushing the button, I have to feel that the thing is an organic whole, that the forms integrate in some crucial way.\"\n\n=== Recurring Sets of \"Aleatory Images\" ===\nOne feature of the subconscious replicated in Ballen's psychological realms is the presence of the uncanny: the juxtaposition of incongruous, or unexpected, inexplicable elements to produce \u201cnew meanings that have yet to be formulated\u201d and mimic the irrationality, free association and symbolic functioning of the unconscious mind. Didi Bozzini wrote that the relation between Ballen and his subjects disrupted the \"laziness of our everyday gaze\", thereby referring to the way in which his works subvert visual schemas, syntax or narratives.\n\nYoung writes that this coming together or \u201cassemblage\u201d of random elements as if by chance encounter can be deemed as \u201caleatory because it as if they have been put together by a throw of dice.\u201d<ref name=\"Ballen 2017 8\">{{Cite book|title=Ballenesque|last=Ballen|first=Roger|publisher=Thames and Hudson|year=2017|isbn=978-0500545218|location=London|pages=8}}</ref> They become absurdist because there is no context for their appearance or explanation of any relation between them, leaving them hanging in... a limbo of alienation\u201d.<ref name=\"Ballen 2017 8\"/> This anarchy in meaning is also extended to the way in which the natural order of things and social norms are subverted.\n\nFor these reasons, Rhodes employs [[Mikhail Bakhtin|Bakhtin]]\u2019s concepts of the \u201ccarnival\" and the \"[[carnivalesque]]\u201d to enter the Ballenesque aesthetic, whether that be in his photography and film, or drawing and installation. Carnival is characterized by the idea of the world turned upside down, when socially established rules are reversed, and the natural order is loosened. As a result, it is also marked by an embrace of the grotesque and the absurd.\u201d<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=The World According to Roger Ballen|last=Rhodes|first=Colin|publisher=Thames and Hudson|year=2020|isbn=9780500545218|location=London|pages=25}}</ref> Young links this to the chaos evoked by the way in which Ballen\u2019s photographs created a contiguity between natural and unnatural worlds, human, animal and inanimate objects, such that they are on the \u201csame plane of being\u201d. He writes that \u201cAll things are precipitated into an empty, degraded limbo of waste, of refuse, or debris or decay, where they live together as equals but without any relation between them.\"<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nBallen writes: \u201cThere\u2019s an aspect of the subconscious sense of things going out of control, being on the margin, not being able to control life in any real way. Things just fall apart. It is also enhanced by the decay and disintegration of things into the pervasive dirt. Dirt is an ever-presence in Ballen\u2019s work. As Warner Marien puts it: \u201cStains, infect surfaces, mildew climbs walls and artificial light accentuates soiled people and things. The indoor presence of animals like pigs, chickens and goats not only adds to the grime, it evokes physical and spiritual decay.\u201d This means that high-flown, abstract spirituality is incarnated in the earthly and material.\n\n=== Dark Junctures of Disjunction ===\nTogether, these elements, cultivate worlds that no longer reside in the realm of the \u2018real\u2019, or veridical perceptual experiencing. In fact, Ballen's photography moves away from the traditional role of photography\u2014to replicate or document the world we recognize. Instead, through his visual vocabulary and integration of elements, he moves into the realm of the abstract. Rhodes writes that is medium is \u201cfaithfully designed to represent visual reality, yet the realities he records are by turns absurd, transgressive, ethereal and uncanny.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The World According to Roger Ballen|last=Rhodes|first=Colin|publisher=Thames and Hudson|year=2020|isbn=9780500545218|location=London|pages=27}}</ref>\n\n==Works==\nBallen\u2019s work can be segmented into several periods, each of which comprises published photographic series:\n\n=== Documentary: Street Photography and Portraiture (1968- 2000). ===\nAs a student at Berkley, [[Woodstock|Ballen]] captured the [[Civil rights movement|Civil Rights movement]] and the [[Vietnam War]]. He photographed ''Woodstock'' in the summer of 1969, producing a series of photographs that were only published recently in the ''New York Times'', on the 50th university of the revolutionary music festival.<ref name=\"Wender 2019\"/> In his first publication, ''Boyhood'' (1979) Ballen presented a series of photographs of boys (chosen from 15000 images), shot during his four-year quest across the continents of Europe, Asia, Central and North America. The book captures archetypes of this universal brotherhood (from Nepal, to Indonesia, Israel to America): \u201ctheir adventures, games, dreams and mischief.\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rogerballen.com/boyhood/|title=Boyhood|last=Ballen|first=Roger|date=2020|website=Roger Ballen Photography|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nIn ''Dorps: Small Towns of South Africa'' (1986), Ballen documented the small towns and villages in unmodernised \"hinterlands\" of [[Apartheid]] South Africa, visited during his mineral exploration. The book contains weathered portraits of the corners, artifacts, trading stores, churches, main streets, signs, ornaments people and interior, dilapidated columns.<ref>{{Cite book|last=van Wyk|first=Gary|title=Encyclopedia of Twentieth-Century Photography|publisher=Routledge|year=2006|isbn=9781135205362|location=London|pages=94}}</ref> Ballen has often stated that ''Dorps'' was his most important project in that he went \u201cinside\u201d metaphorically and physically, started using flash, found objects such as wires and walls. He also encountered the archetypes that he would develop over the course of his career.  The project was explored in a 1986 programme by the South African Broadcasting Commission, with an episode entitled ''Dorps'' (1986).\n\nThe poor white came to the fore in ''Platteland'': ''Images from Rural South Africa'' (1994). Here, Ballen presented tragic portraits of these people, who were facing political and economic anguish at the demise of an Apartheid system specifically designed to elevate them and guarantee government employment. As psychological studies of \u201ccharacter archetypes\u201d, the photographs were described by the photographic critic, [[Susan Sontag]] \u201cthe most impressive sequence of portraits [she'd] seen in years\u201d.  The book also marked the beginning of Ballen's use of the middle format camera and flash, as well as the deliberate choice of a square negative and black-and-white film.The [[The South Bank Show|SouthBank Show]] aired an episode on the book in 1995 entitled, \u201cPlatteland\u201d.\n\n=== Theatre of the Absurd (2000-2008) ===\nBallen gained international acclaim from his next series ''Outland'' (2000)'','' where these psychological studies moved from documentary photography into realms of fiction. The characters become actors who perform on elaborate stage sets, or dark or discomforting tableaux, with poses, masks and props. Graffiti and wires dangle haphazardly, and elements are more deliberately placed and formal elements structure the composition so as to enhance the allusion to \u201cuniversal and metaphorical scenarios\u201d. ''Outland'' was named Best Photographic book of the year at [[PHotoEspa\u00f1a|PhotoEspa\u00f1a]] 2001, Madrid, Spain and Ballen the Photographer of the Year at [[Rencontres d'Arles|Rencontres d\u2019 Arles]] in 2002. An expanded edition of ''Outland'', containing 30 previously unpublished pictures, was published in 2014. A film, entitled ''Roger Ballen\u2019s Outland'', directed by Ben Jay Crossman, followed the book in 2015.\n\nIn ''Shadow Chamber'' (2005), Ballen's work made leaps into a metaphoric, surreal dimension with multiple conscious and subconscious meanings: \"ambiguous images of people, animals and objects posed in mysterious, cell-like rooms. The images focus on the interactions between the people, animals and objects that inhabit mysterious rooms.\" <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rogerballen.com/shadow-chamber/|title=Shadow Chamber|last=Ballen|first=Roger|date=February 2020|website=Roger Ballen Photography|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> A blurring between fact and fiction, and Young's notion \u201caleatory image\u201d, is created by the way in which the artifacts, scribbles, wires, dogs, rabbits, kittens and subjects that hide (in couches, shirts or boxes), interact in unexpected ways. As a consequence, this project ushered Ballen's surrealism, and the integration of documentary photography with art forms such as painting, theatre and sculpture, venturing into the realm of abstraction. As Sobieszek writes in his introduction to the book: \u201cTo discern fact from fiction in this work may be simply impossible; to tell acting from real life may also be; to bother with such discernment may not be only futile but missing the point.\u201d<ref>{{Cite book|last=Ballen|first=Roger|title=Shadow Chamber|publisher=Phaidon|year=2005|isbn=9780714844664|location=London|pages=8}}</ref> Saskia Vredeland directed the film ''Momento Mori'' (2005) as an accompaniment to the project, which was supported by the [[Netherlands Film Fund]] and screened at the [[Netherlands Film Festival]] in 2006.\n\n''Boarding House'' (2008) comprises over 70 black and white images. They are tableaux with a greater emphasis on drawn and sculptural elements, and a sense of collaboration between the artist and his subjects, although the subject starts to disappear.  Ballen photographed his subjects at a house in a secret location on the outskirts of Johannesburg so that the images became greater metaphors for spaces in the mind. Ballen notes that, in photography, the \u201chuman face is an all-encompassing feature in trying to understand the meaning of the work. Thus, if there is no face in the image, the other elements in the photograph have less of a change of being noticed.\" Young writes that \u201c[i]n Boarding House, the perspectives and images become more two-dimensional, more avowedly pictorial though at the same time with greater violence. This is a private interior imaging the necropolis of a world outside that is only too intimate and real.\u201d <ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Psychological: The Space of the Mind (2014-2016) ===\nIn ''Asylum of the Birds'' (2014), Ballen further explored his mysterious photographic spaces as a refuges and prisons. In these worlds, people and animals\u2019 live side by side, and there is an ever-presence of birds, who perform in the sculptural and decorated interior. In the images, \"caged heads and birds are positioned against nightmarish, collage-like backgrounds, and mannequins and headless torsos assume contorted positions\".<ref>{{Cite journal|journal=British Journal of Photography|title=Roger Ballen lifts lid on Asylum of the Birds|last=|first=|date=2014|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> A film, entitled Roger Ballen's ''Asylum of the Birds'' (2014), was made by Ben Jay Crossman. Ballen describes that the \"house\" in these photographs is a place of a landlord who allowed birds he collected to fly all over the house, cage-less. Ballen writes: <blockquote>\"The house is full of birds, ducks, chickens, pigeons, doves, whatever, different birds and they're all over the house, flying from one room to the next...[t]he people that live in the house are people from different aspects of the streets in South Africa\u2014some people come from other places in Africa, some are unemployed, some are products of poverty, violence and anything else. I interacted with these birds and animals to create these photographs.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://time.com/34274/the-dark-side-roger-ballens-asylum/|title=The Dark Side: Roger Ballen's 'Asylum'|last=Campbell|first=Erica Fahr|date=2012|website=Time Magazine|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref></blockquote>In ''The Theatre of the Apparitions'' (2016), inspired by the sight of hand-drawn carvings on blacked-out windows in an abandoned women's prison, Ballen (in conjunction with his artistic director Marguerite Rossouw) began to use different spray paints on glass and then \u2018drawing on\u2019 or removing the paint with a sharp object to let natural light through.<ref name=\":2\" /> These photographs resemble prehistoric cave-paintings: the black, dimensionless spaces on glass.

He became increasingly involved in video, installations and collage and painting and other multimedia. From\u00a02006 the co-leader of the South African rap group, [[Die Antwoord|Die Antwoord's]] [[Yolandi Visser|Yolandi Visse]]<nowiki/>r, contacted Ballen proposing a collaboration/ In 2011, he directed the music video for the song \"I Fink U Freeky\" by Die Antwoord which has been viewed 150 million times on YouTube. ''Roger Ballen - Die Antwoord: I Fink U Freeky'' (2013) was a book collaboration with Die Antwoord, with group's leaders, [[Yolandi Visser|Yolandi]] and [[Watkin Tudor Jones|Ninja]], as the photographic subjects.\n\nAfter completing ''Asylum of the Birds'' in 2013, Roger Ballen began his last series of black and white negative based imagery in which Rats dominated every image.\u00a0 The unpublished project, which was completed in 2017 once again integrated drawing, painting, sculpture through the camera and eye of the artist. The results reveal a world immersed in chaos, absurdity and dream like reality. In 2020, he will complete a photographic and video project of a person dressed as a cartoon rat in which this character is involved in activities that might be seen as politically and socially absurd.\n\nIn 2015, Ballen created a conceptual installation artwork in Finland's Serlachius Museum in Mantta. He transformed a dilapidated house in the Finish forest into a complete sculptural entity that was installed in the museum's new pavilion.The work coincided with a new publication, ''The House Project'' (2015) with long-time collaborator, writer Didi Bozzini. It moved away from a historical exposition of Ballen's work in favour of a psychological one, evoking possible literary and philosophical references in his work. Ballen has subsequently built installations all over the world, for example in the Istanbul Museum of Art (2016), Galleria Massimo Minini 2016, Brescia, Italy; 2017, Les Rencontres Arles (2017), Zeitz Mocaa, Cape Town (2017), City Passage, No Exit Revisited (2018) Wiesbaden; Museo de Fotografia, 2018, Fortaleza, Brazil.\n\nBallen's collaboration with ''[[Comme des Gar\u00e7ons]]'' featured at Paris Fashion Week saw his artwork on the brand's Homme Plus A/W 2015 range, where his images were etched onto the back of white coats for their Fall 2015 collection. In ''No Joke'' (2013), Ballen and Rossouw collaborated with Asger Carlson to create photo-sculpted figures, swapped self-portraits, substituted and reassigned body parts, oddly occupied architecture, cut and collaged hand-drawn masks and graffiti, as well as spiders, foxes, angels, demons and dolls in an imaginary dream-like set on which an elusive narrative unfolds.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rogerballen.com/no-joke/|title=No Joke|last=Ballen|first=Roger|date=2020|website=www.rogerballen.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> In ''Unleashed'' (2017), Ballen and Rossouw worked together with artist and sculpture, Hans Lemmen to create images that integrate Lemmen's figurative drawings (that reference natural history, archaeology, paleontology, mythological proto-civilization) with Ballen's theatrical depictions of the subconscious.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rogerballen.com/unleashed/|title=Unleashed|last=Ballen|first=Roger|date=2020|website=Roger Ballen Photography|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nIn 2018, Ballen released his first series of colour photographs after Leica gave him a colour camera with which to experiment with. A series of colour polaroids was first shown at a booth of Reflex Gallery at Unseen Photo Fair, and 150 of them published in a book by the gallery and van Sniderden, entitled ''Roger Ballen: Polaroids - Volume One'' (2017).\n\nIn September 2019, Ballen opened his largest show yet at HalleSaint Pierre in Paris titled ''The World According to Roger Ballen'' in which he exhibited numerous installations, drawings, videos, and photographs\n\n==Publications==\n===Publications by Ballen===\n{{Expand list|date=May 2016}}\n*''Boyhood.''

His oeuvre, which spans five decades, began with the documentary photography field but evolved into the creation of distinctive fictionalized realms that also integrate the mediums of film, installation, theatre, sculpture, painting and drawing. Marginalized people, animals, found objects, wires and child-like drawings inhabit the unlocatable worlds presented in Ballen's artworks. Ballen describes his works as existential psychodramas that touch the subconscious mind and evoke the underbelly of the human condition.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.absolutearts.com/artsnews/2001/06/19/28729.html|title=Portraits as Still Lives: The Photographs of Roger Ballen|last=Peter|first=Weiermair|date=2001|website=Absolute Arts|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> They aim to break through the repressed thoughts and feelings by engaging him in themes of chaos and order, madness or unruly states of being, the human relationship to the animal world, life and death, universal archetypes of the psyche and experiences of otherness.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rogerballen.com/articles/six-photographers-who-helped-us-visualise-the-human-psyche/|title=Six photographers who helped us visualise the human psyche|last=Manatakis|first=Lex|date=March 2019|website=Daze Digital|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n==Biography==\nBallen was born in New York City to Irving Ballen and Adrienne Ballen (nee Miller), and was raised as Jewish. His father was an attorney and the founding partner of McLaughlin, Stern. His mother was a member of the famous photo agency Magnum from 1963 to 1967 prior to opening the Photography House Gallery with Inge Bondi in New York City in 1968. Ballen became acquainted with the photographs of [[Andr\u00e9 Kert\u00e9sz|Andre Kertesz,]] [[Edward Steichen]], [[Paul Strand]], [[Elliot Erwitt]], [[Bruce Davidson (photographer)|Bruce Davidson]] and [[Henri Cartier-Bresson]] either from published photographs in albums or through personal acquaintance. He attended Scarborough School, New York, and went to Camp Stinson during his childhood summers. At age 13, he received his first camera, and was soon after employed for a first commercial job of photographing McDonald's, Mamaroneck, New York. Ballen was interested in the realism of Rembrandt from a young age, and was drawn to photographing elderly men. He recalls that one of the most \u201cvivid and pivotal moment[s] in his life occurred in 1968 when [his] parents gave him a Nikon FTn camera for [his] high school graduation. On the very same day [he] went to the outskirts of Sing Sing Prison near New York city to take photographs\u201d.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Ballenesque|last=Ballen|first=Roger|publisher=Thames and Hudson|year=2017|isbn=978-0500519691|location=London|pages=17}}</ref>\n\nHe later studied psychology at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], which was an epicenter for the 1960s counter-culture. Here, he was exposed to [[R. D. Laing|R.D. Laing\u2019s]] anti-psychiatry movement, Jung\u2019s concept of the [[Collective unconscious|\"collective unconscious\"]], the [[Theatre of the Absurd]] ([[Harold Pinter|Pinter]], [[Beckett]] and [[Eug\u00e8ne Ionesco|Ionesco]]) and existential philosophers, such as [[Jean-Paul Sartre|Sartre]] and [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]], all of which came to be formative in the development of his artistic style. During the summer of 1969, he photographed [[Woodstock]], a series which was published in the ''New York Times'' 50th anniversary of the iconic music festival. Ballen notes that capturing Woodstock \u201cplayed a role in [his] getting to know the human experience, human endeavour, finding the moment, working with people, searching in difficult circumstances for something that stood out. If I had to say what are important aspects that run through the work, it\u2019s trying to come to terms with pure chaos.\u201d<ref name=\"Wender 2019\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/06/arts/music/roger-ballen-photos-woodstock.html|title=Woodstock at 50: Roger Ballen Revisits His Never-Before-Published Woodstock Photos|last=Wender|first=Jessie|date=2019|website=New York Times|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Ballen made his first film ''Ill Wind'' after completing a course in film making in 1972.\n\nAfter the death of his mother Adrienne in 1973, he, like many of the counter-culture, developed existential longing in response aversion to the materialism of Western society and his suburban upbringing. He spent the subsequent five months Art Students of League of New York. Here, he painted [[Outsider art|art brut]], [[Primitivism|primitivist]], paintings, that according to his teacher, \u201cbelonged in the Stone Age\u201d.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Ballen|first=Roger|title=Ballenesque, Roger Ballen: A Retrospective|publisher=Thames and Hudson|year=2017|isbn=978-0500519691|location=London|pages=2010}}</ref> In the autumn of 1973, yearning to find Conrad\u2019s \u201cheart of darkness\u201d and Eastern nirvana, he left embarked on a five-year journey, that would take him by land from Cairo to Cape Town; Istanbul to New Guinea (1973-1978). On this trip, he continued an ongoing interest in taking pictures of enigmatic men against dramatic surfaces of shrines, temples and markets. He also began a series of \u2018field photographs' of streets, earthen paths or walls (inspired by the [[Color field|colour field]] painting movement) and developed an interest in observing the life of young boys. He kept Kodak Tri-X or Plus X film a green canvas knapsack which he would tie to his legs during meals or overnight train rides or tied to hotel bedposts. He processed the film and would send it to his father in New York.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Ballenesque|last=Ballen|first=Roger|publisher=Thames and Hudson|year=2017|isbn=978-0500519691|location=London|pages=15\u201325}}</ref>\n\nOn this trip, he arrived in South Africa, where he met his future wife, an artist, paper-maker and art teacher, Lynda Moross, whom he married in 1980, and had twins, Amanda and Paul, in 1989. These travels also spurred on his first photographic book entitled ''Boyhood,'' which was an series of universal, iconic images of boys that Ballen had encountered while seeking to recreate his childhood in the adventure of travel.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rogerballen.com/articles/ballenesque-an-insight-into-the-life-and-work-of-roger-ballen/|title=Ballenesque: An insight into the life and work of Roger Ballen|last=Pete|first=Littlewood|date=2018|website=Roger Ballen Photographer|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Disillusioned by the idea of commercial photography, Ballen enrolled at the [[Colorado School of Mines]] in 1978, where he received in PhD in Mineral Economics in 1981. He permanently settled in Johannesburg in 1982, where he worked as a self-employed mining entrepreneur until 2010. This profession took him into the South African countryside in which he travelled to remote small villages called \u201cdorps\u201d and rural areas referred to as the \u201cplatteland\u201d, in which he photographed the marginalized whites who once privileged from Apartheid, but who were now isolated and economically deprived.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Ballenesque|last=Ballen|first=Roger|publisher=Thames and Hudson|year=2017|isbn=978-0500519691|location=London|pages=75}}</ref> During this time, he worked closely with his master printer and friend, Dennis da Silva. After 1994, he no longer looked to the countryside for his subject matter, finding it closer to home in Johannesburg, where he continues to work. Since 2007, he has worked closely with his art director, Marguerite Rossouw.\n\nIn 2018, Ballen received an Honorary Doctorate in Art and Design from Kingston University. In 2008, the Roger Ballen Foundation was founded to promote the advancement of education of photography in Africa. From April 2020, it will be housed in the Roger Ballen Centre for Photographic Art, Forest Town, Johannesburg.\n\n== \"Ballenesque\" Aesthetic ==\nBallen\u2019s early street photography and the psychological portraiture of ''Boyhood, Dorps'' and ''Platteland'' was influenced by the work of [[Henri Cartier-Bresson|Cartier Bresson]], [[Walker Evans]], [[Diane Arbus]] and [[Elliott Erwitt|Elliot Erwitt]]. The distinctive \u201cBallenesque\u201d style of his documentary fiction (from 2000 onward), has been said to reference the artistic genres of [[Theatre of the Absurd|absurdist theatre]], [[outsider art]], [[Outsider art|art brut]], [[Na\u00efve art|naivism]], photographic [[surrealism]] and the photographic grotesque. He has also said to have been influenced by a wide range of other literary artistic/philosophical work, such as that of Beckett, [[Franz Kafka|Kafka]], [[Carl Jung|Jung]] and [[Antonin Artaud|Artaud.]]\n\nRobert Young coins the term \u201cBallenesque\u201d to refer to the unique qualities of Ballen\u2019s work that mark and identify it as his own. Young identifies four elements, that, in their \u201cvarious shifting combinations and relations, together make up the constituent factors of the -esque factor.\u201d<ref>{{Cite book|title=Ballenesque|last=Young|first=Robert|publisher=Thames and Hudson|year=2017|isbn=978-0500545218|location=London|pages=18}}</ref> These include:\n\n=== Prehensile Portraits of the \u201cUnderprivileged\u201d ===\nAlthough present as Ballen\u2019s work has evolved, the presence of the marginalized subject is a feature of much of the artist\u2019s earlier work. Ballen has emphasized his works do not have a sociopolitical agenda; they rather make a psychological and aesthetic statement . He has also stressed that these subjects are not anonymous; he has developed close friendships with them over the course of the history of working with them:<blockquote>\u201cFor many of the people I have worked with over the years, the bond we established while working together, gave them a sense of purpose and meaning. On a typical day, I might receive twenty or thirty phone messages, some asking me when I am going to visit next, some making requests for food or medicine, and others reminding me that it is someone\u2019s birthday. In a single day, I can be a doctor, a lawyer, a priest and a social worker.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Ballenesque|last=Ballen|first=Roger|publisher=Thames and Hudson|year=2017|isbn=978-0500545218|location=London|pages=203}}</ref></blockquote>For Young, however, the distinctiveness of these photographs does not lie in the mere documenting of these \u201cothers\u201d, but rather, by the fact that these subjects are captured in such a way that they feel they \u201clook back\u201d at the spectator. Ballen\u2019s square format, shallow depth of field and space, confronts the viewer with a closeness to, and simultaneous inaccessibility of these people, who often seem to have \u201cpsychic disturbance\u201d. This remoteness is cultivated by the way in which they do not leave their often bizarre, domestic or theatrical, mysterious settings. For Young, that we cannot engage in empathy, sympathy or self-discovery; we merely submit to looking at their \u201ctransfixing gaze\u201d.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Ballenesque|last=Ballen|first=Roger|publisher=Thames and Hudson|year=2017|isbn=978-0500545218|location=London|pages=8\u20139}}</ref>\n\n=== Windowless Walls ===\nThis \u201cremoteness\u201d of the places of these inaccessible subjects is evoked because the spaces in which they appear are otherworldly\u2014they exist in the realm of the photograph but do not seem to reference actual locations in everyday reality. Young writes: \u201cthere is no world that we can reference here.\u201d Ballen\u2019s use of black-and-white photography up until 2018, contributes powerfully to this transformation. He writes: \u201cBlack-and-white is a very minimalist art form and unlike color photographs does not pretend to mimic the world in a manner similar to the way the human eye might perceive. Black-and-white is essentially an abstract way to interpret and transform what one might refer to as reality.\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lensculture.com/roger-ballen|title=Roger Ballen Video Interview: Disturbing Visions from the Dark Side|last=Ballen|first=Roger|date=|website=LensCulture|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nYoung further notes that the claustrophobic two-dimensional planes of the photograph itself are inscribed with drawings, marks and lines. From the early 90s onward, they appear in Ballen\u2019s photographs in wire (antenna lines electrical cords, twisted cable, baling wire, woven fence, coat hangers and snippets of anonymous strands). These mysterious closed rooms have been referred to by Ballen as \u201cvisual embodiments\u201d of the \u2018place\u2019 of the subconscious mind, and as set in which people and animals present themselves and interact with objects and drawings; moments preserved by the stillness of the photograph.\n\nHe also emphasizes that these worlds are an ''artistic'' reality, in which there is a conversation and interaction of visual elements to create formal harmony. Ballen seems concise form and complex meaning in his images. He writes: \u201cIt\u2019s not so much a matter of content; it\u2019s also a matter of form. I am first and foremost a formalist. I always say that the form comes before the meaning. Before I think about the picture; before I think about pushing the button, I have to feel that the thing is an organic whole, that the forms integrate in some crucial way.\"\n\n=== Recurring Sets of \"Aleatory Images\" ===\nOne feature of the subconscious replicated in Ballen\u2019s psychological realms is the presence of the uncanny: the juxtaposition of incongruous, or unexpected, inexplicable elements to produce \u201cnew meanings that have yet to be formulated\u201d and mimic the irrationality, free association and symbolic functioning of the unconscious mind. Didi Bozzini wrote that the relation between Ballen and his subjects disrupted the \"laziness of our everyday gaze\", thereby referring to the way in which his works subvert visual schemas, syntax or narratives.\n\nYoung writes that this coming together or \u201cassemblage\u201d of random elements as if by chance encounter can be deemed as \u201caleatory because it as if they have been put together by a throw of dice.\u201d<ref name=\"Ballen 2017 8\">{{Cite book|title=Ballenesque|last=Ballen|first=Roger|publisher=Thames and Hudson|year=2017|isbn=978-0500545218|location=London|pages=8}}</ref> They become absurdist because there is no context for their appearance or explanation of any relation between them, leaving them hanging in\u2026 a limbo of alienation\u201d.<ref name=\"Ballen 2017 8\"/> This anarchy in meaning is also extended to the way in which the natural order of things and social norms are subverted.\n\nFor these reasons, Rhodes employs [[Mikhail Bakhtin|Bakhtin]]\u2019s concepts of the \u201ccarnival\" and the \"[[carnivalesque]]\u201d to enter the Ballenesque aesthetic, whether that be in his photography and film, or drawing and installation. Carnival is characterized by the idea of the world turned upside down, when socially established rules are reversed, and the natural order is loosened. As a result, it is also marked by an embrace of the grotesque and the absurd.\u201d<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=The World According to Roger Ballen|last=Rhodes|first=Colin|publisher=Thames and Hudson|year=2020|isbn=9780500545218|location=London|pages=25}}</ref> Young links this to the chaos evoked by the way in which Ballen\u2019s photographs created a contiguity between natural and unnatural worlds, human, animal and inanimate objects, such that they are on the \u201csame plane of being\u201d. He writes that \u201cAll things are precipitated into an empty, degraded limbo of waste, of refuse, or debris or decay, where they live together as equals but without any relation between them.\"<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nBallen writes: \u201cThere\u2019s an aspect of the subconscious sense of things going out of control, being on the margin, not being able to control life in any real way. Things just fall apart. It is also enhanced by the decay and disintegration of things into the pervasive dirt. Dirt is an ever-presence in Ballen\u2019s work. As Warner Marien puts it: \u201cStains, infect surfaces, mildew climbs walls and artificial light accentuates soiled people and things. The indoor presence of animals like pigs, chickens and goats not only adds to the grime, it evokes physical and spiritual decay.\u201d This means that high-flown, abstract spirituality is incarnated in the earthly and material.\n\n=== Dark Junctures of Disjunction ===\nTogether, these elements, cultivate worlds that no longer reside in the realm of the \u2018real\u2019, or veridical perceptual experiencing. In fact, Ballen\u2019s photography moves away from the traditional role of photography\u2014to replicate or document the world we recognize. Instead, through his visual vocabulary and integration of elements, he moves into the realm of the abstract. Rhodes writes that is medium is \u201cfaithfully designed to represent visual reality, yet the realities he records are by turns absurd, transgressive, ethereal and uncanny.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The World According to Roger Ballen|last=Rhodes|first=Colin|publisher=Thames and Hudson|year=2020|isbn=9780500545218|location=London|pages=27}}</ref>\n\n==Works==\nBallen\u2019s work can be segmented into several periods, each of which comprises published photographic series:\n\n=== Documentary: Street Photography and Portraiture (1968- 2000). ===\nAs a student at Berkley, [[Woodstock|Ballen]] captured the [[Civil rights movement|Civil Rights movement]] and the [[Vietnam War]]. He photographed ''Woodstock'' in the summer of 1969, producing a series of photographs that were only published recently in the ''New York Times'', on the 50th university of the revolutionary music festival.<ref name=\"Wender 2019\"/> In his first publication, ''Boyhood'' (1979) Ballen presented a series of photographs of boys (chosen from 15000 images), shot during his four-year quest across the continents of Europe, Asia, Central and North America. The book captures archetypes of this universal brotherhood (from Nepal, to Indonesia, Israel to America): \u201ctheir adventures, games, dreams and mischief.\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rogerballen.com/boyhood/|title=Boyhood|last=Ballen|first=Roger|date=2020|website=Roger Ballen Photography|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nIn ''Dorps: Small Towns of South Africa'' (1986), Ballen documented the small towns and villages in unmodernised \"hinterlands\" of [[Apartheid]] South Africa, visited during his mineral exploration. The book contains weathered portraits of the corners, artifacts, trading stores, churches, main streets, signs, ornaments people and interior, dilapidated columns.<ref>{{Cite book|last=van Wyk|first=Gary|title=Encyclopedia of Twentieth-Century Photography|publisher=Routledge|year=2006|isbn=9781135205362|location=London|pages=94}}</ref> Ballen has often stated that ''Dorps'' was his most important project in that he went \u201cinside\u201d metaphorically and physically, started using flash, found objects such as wires and walls. He also encountered the archetypes that he would develop over the course of his career.  The project was explored in a 1986 programme by the South African Broadcasting Commission, with an episode entitled ''Dorps'' (1986).\n\nThe poor white came to the fore in ''Platteland'': ''Images from Rural South Africa'' (1994). Here, Ballen presented tragic portraits of these people, who were facing political and economic anguish at the demise of an Apartheid system specifically designed to elevate them and guarantee government employment. As psychological studies of \u201ccharacter archetypes\u201d, the photographs were described by the photographic critic, [[Susan Sontag]] \u201cthe most impressive sequence of portraits [she'd] seen in years\u201d.  The book also marked the beginning of Ballen's use of the middle format camera and flash, as well as the deliberate choice of a square negative and black-and-white film.The [[The South Bank Show|SouthBank Show]] aired an episode on the book in 1995 entitled, \u201cPlatteland\u201d.\n\n=== Theatre of the Absurd (2000-2008) ===\nBallen gained international acclaim from his next series ''Outland'' (2000)'','' where these psychological studies moved from documentary photography into realms of fiction. The characters become actors who perform on elaborate stage sets, or dark or discomforting tableaux, with poses, masks and props. Graffiti and wires dangle haphazardly, and elements are more deliberately placed and formal elements structure the composition so as to enhance the allusion to \u201cuniversal and metaphorical scenarios\u201d. ''Outland'' was named Best Photographic book of the year at [[PHotoEspa\u00f1a|PhotoEspa\u00f1a]] 2001, Madrid, Spain and Ballen the Photographer of the Year at [[Rencontres d'Arles|Rencontres d\u2019 Arles]] in 2002. An expanded edition of ''Outland'', containing 30 previously unpublished pictures, was published in 2014. A film, entitled ''Roger Ballen\u2019s Outland'', directed by Ben Jay Crossman, followed the book in 2015.\n\nIn ''Shadow Chamber'' (2005), Ballen's work made leaps into a metaphoric, surreal dimension with multiple conscious and subconscious meanings: \"ambiguous images of people, animals and objects posed in mysterious, cell-like rooms. The images focus on the interactions between the people, animals and objects that inhabit mysterious rooms.\" <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rogerballen.com/shadow-chamber/|title=Shadow Chamber|last=Ballen|first=Roger|date=February 2020|website=Roger Ballen Photography|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> A blurring between fact and fiction, and Young\u2019s notion \u201caleatory image\u201d, is created by the way in which the artifacts, scribbles, wires, dogs, rabbits, kittens and subjects that hide (in couches, shirts or boxes), interact in unexpected ways. As a consequence, this project ushered Ballen\u2019s surrealism, and the integration of documentary photography with art forms such as painting, theatre and sculpture, venturing into the realm of abstraction. As Sobieszek writes in his introduction to the book: \u201cTo discern fact from fiction in this work may be simply impossible; to tell acting from real life may also be; to bother with such discernment may not be only futile but missing the point.\u201d<ref>{{Cite book|last=Ballen|first=Roger|title=Shadow Chamber|publisher=Phaidon|year=2005|isbn=9780714844664|location=London|pages=8}}</ref> Saskia Vredeland directed the film ''Momento Mori'' (2005) as an accompaniment to the project, which was supported by the [[Netherlands Film Fund]] and screened at the [[Netherlands Film Festival]] in 2006.\n\n''Boarding House'' (2008) comprises over 70 black and white images. They are tableaux with a greater emphasis on drawn and sculptural elements, and a sense of collaboration between the artist and his subjects, although the subject starts to disappear.  Ballen photographed his subjects at a house in a secret location on the outskirts of Johannesburg so that the images became greater metaphors for spaces in the mind. Ballen notes that, in photography, the \u201chuman face is an all-encompassing feature in trying to understand the meaning of the work. Thus, if there is no face in the image, the other elements in the photograph have less of a change of being noticed.\" Young writes that \u201c[i]n Boarding House, the perspectives and images become more two-dimensional, more avowedly pictorial though at the same time with greater violence. This is a private interior imaging the necropolis of a world outside that is only too intimate and real.\u201d <ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Psychological: The Space of the Mind (2014-2016) ===\nIn ''Asylum of the Birds'' (2014), Ballen further explored his mysterious photographic spaces as a refuges and prisons. In these worlds, people and animals\u2019 live side by side, and there is a ever-presence of birds, who perform in the sculptural and decorated interior. In the images, \"caged heads and birds are positioned against nightmarish, collage-like backgrounds, and mannequins and headless torsos assume contorted positions\".<ref>{{Cite journal|journal=British Journal of Photography|title=Roger Ballen lifts lid on Asylum of the Birds|last=|first=|date=2014|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> A film, entitled Roger Ballen\u2019s ''Asylum of the Birds'' (2014), was made by Ben Jay Crossman. Ballen describes that the \"house\" in these photographs is a place of a landlord who allowed birds he collected to fly all over the house, cage-less. Ballen writes: <blockquote>\"The house is full of birds, ducks, chickens, pigeons, doves, whatever, different birds and they're all over the house, flying from one room to the next...[t]he people that live in the house are people from different aspects of the streets in South Africa\u2014some people come from other places in Africa, some are unemployed, some are products of poverty, violence and anything else. I interacted with these birds and animals to create these photographs.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://time.com/34274/the-dark-side-roger-ballens-asylum/|title=The Dark Side: Roger Ballen's 'Asylum'|last=Campbell|first=Erica Fahr|date=2012|website=Time Magazine|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref></blockquote>In ''The Theatre of the Apparitions'' (2016), inspired by the sight of hand-drawn carvings on blacked-out windows in an abandoned women\u2019s prison, Ballen (in conjunction with his artistic director Marguerite Rossouw) began to use different spray paints on glass and then \u2018drawing on\u2019 or removing the paint with a sharp object to let natural light through.<ref name=\":2\" /> These photographs resemble prehistoric cave-paintings: the black, dimensionless spaces on glass. Fossil-like facial forms and dismembered body parts coexist uncomfortably with vaporous, ghost-like shadows.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.rogerballen.com/the-theatre-of-apparitions/|title=The Theatre of Apparitions|last=Ballen|first=Roger|date=2020|website=Roger Ballen Photography|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> In an accompanying film animation, Roger Ballen\u2019s ''Theatre of the Apparitions'' (2016), Emma Calder and Ged Haney created an animated theatre of the book's dismembered people, beasts and ghosts, dance, tumble, make love and tear themselves apart a nightmarish subconscious world.\n\n=== Current: Multimedia, Collaborations and Colour (2014- present) ===\nIn 2014, it was clear that after many years of creating photographic images, Ballen had a developed a need to transcend what people refer to as pure photography. He became increasingly involved in video, installations and collage and painting and other multimedia. From\u00a02006 the co-leader of the South African rap group, [[Die Antwoord|Die Antwoord's]] [[Yolandi Visser|Yolandi Visse]]<nowiki/>r, contacted Ballen proposing a collaboration/ In 2011, he directed the music video for the song \"I Fink U Freeky\" by Die Antwoord which has been viewed 150 million times on YouTube. ''Roger Ballen - Die Antwoord: I Fink U Freeky'' (2013) was a book collaboration with Die Antwoord, with group's leaders, [[Yolandi Visser|Yolandi]] and [[Watkin Tudor Jones|Ninja]], as the photographic subjects.\n\nAfter completing ''Asylum of the Birds'' in 2013 , Roger Ballen began his last series of black and white negative based imagery in which Rats dominated every image.\u00a0 The unpublished project, which was completed in 2017 once again integrated drawing, painting, sculpture through the camera and eye of the artist. The results reveal a world immersed in chaos, absurdity and dream like reality. In 2020, he will complete a photographic and video project of a person dressed as a cartoon rat in which this character is involved in activities that might be seen as politically and socially absurd.\n\nIn 2015, Ballen created a conceptual installation artwork in Finland\u2019s Serlachius Museum in Mantta. He transformed a dilapidated house in the Finish forest into a complete sculptural entity that was installed in the museum's new pavilion.The work coincided with a new publication, ''The House Project'' (2015) with long-time collaborator, writer Didi Bozzini. It moved away from a historical exposition of Ballen's work in favour of a psychological one, evoking possible literary and philosophical references in his work. Ballen has subsequently built installations all over the world, for example in the Istanbul Museum of Art (2016), Galleria Massimo Minini 2016, Brescia, Italy; 2017, Les Rencontres Arles (2017), Zeitz Mocaa, Cape Town (2017), City Passage, No Exit Revisited (2018) Wiesbaden; Museo de Fotografia, 2018, Fortaleza, Brazil.\n\nBallen\u2019s collaboration with ''[[Comme des Gar\u00e7ons]]'' featured at Paris Fashion Week saw his artwork on the brand\u2019s Homme Plus A/W 2015 range, where his images were etched onto the back of white coats for their Fall 2015 collection. In ''No Joke'' (2013), Ballen and Rossouw collaborated with Asger Carlson to create photo-sculpted figures, swapped self-portraits, substituted and re-assigned body parts, oddly occupied architecture, cut and collaged hand-drawn masks and graffiti, as well as spiders, foxes, angels, demons and dolls in an imaginary dream-like set on which an elusive narrative unfolds.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rogerballen.com/no-joke/|title=No Joke|last=Ballen|first=Roger|date=2020|website=www.rogerballen.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> In ''Unleashed'' (2017), Ballen and Rossouw worked together with artist and sculpture, Hans Lemmen to create images that integrate Lemmen\u2019s figurative drawings (that reference natural history, archaeology, paleontology, mythological proto-civilization) with Ballen\u2019s theatrical depictions of the subconscious.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rogerballen.com/unleashed/|title=Unleashed|last=Ballen|first=Roger|date=2020|website=Roger Ballen Photography|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nIn 2018, Ballen released his first series of colour photographs after Leica gave him a colour camera with which to experiment with. A series of colour polaroids was first shown at a booth of Reflex Gallery at Unseen Photo Fair, and 150 of them published in a book by the gallery and van Sniderden, entitled ''Roger Ballen: Polaroids - Volume One'' (2017). \n\nIn September 2019, Ballen opened his largest show yet at HalleSaint Pierre in Paris titled ''The World According to Roger Ballen'' in which he exhibited numerous installations, drawings, videos, and photographs    \n\n==Publications==\n===Publications by Ballen===\n{{Expand list|date=May 2016}}\n*''Boyhood.''
