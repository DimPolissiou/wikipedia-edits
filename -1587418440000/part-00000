However, a United Nations report, ''Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement'' uses the definition of: \n<blockquote>\"persons or groups of persons who have been forced or obliged to flee or to leave their homes or places of habitual residence, in particular as a result of or in order to avoid the effects of armed conflict, situations of generalized violence, violations of human rights or natural or human-made disasters, and who have not crossed an internationally recognized State border.\"<ref name=\"Deng 1998\">{{Cite book| first=Francis | last=Deng| contribution=The guiding principles on internal displacement| title=E/CN.4/1998/53/Add.l, February 11.

Annotations.\" The American Society of International Law & The Brookings Institution Project on Internal Displacement. Studies in Transnational Legal Policy, No. 32, 2000.</ref> In this way, the document \"intentionally steers\ntoward flexibility rather than legal precision\"<ref>VINCENT, M, \"IDPs: rights and status\", Forced Migration Review, August 2000, p. 30.</ref> as the words \"in particular\" indicate that the list of reasons for displacement is not exhaustive. However, as Erin Mooney has pointed out, \"global statistics on internal displacement generally count only IDPs uprooted by conflict and human rights violations. Moreover, a recent study has recommended that the IDP concept should be defined even more narrowly, to be limited to persons displaced by violence.\"<ref>MOONEY, E. \"The Concept of Internal Displacement and the Case for Internally Displaced Persons as a Category of Concern.\" Refugee Survey Quarterly. (24) 3, 2005, p. 12.</ref> Thus, despite the non-exhaustive reasons of internal displacement, many consider IDPs as those who would be defined as refugees if they were to cross an international border, hence, the term refugees in all but name is often applied to IDPs.\n\n==IDP populations==\nIt is very difficult to get accurate figures for internally displaced persons because populations aren't constant. IDPs may be returning home while others are fleeing, others may periodically return to IDP camps to take advantage of humanitarian aid. While the case of IDPs in large camps such as those in Darfur, western Sudan, are relatively well-reported, it is very difficult to assess those IDPs who flee to larger towns and cities. It is necessary in many instances to supplement official figures with additional information obtained from operational humanitarian organizations on the ground.  Thus, the 24.5 million figure must be treated as an estimate.<ref name='IDMC 2006'>{{cite book | last = IDMC | first =  | authorlink =  | title = INTERNAL DISPLACEMENT Global Overview of Trends and Developments in 2006 | publisher = Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre, Norwegian Refugee Council | date = April 2006 | location = Geneva | pages =  | url = http://www.internal-displacement.org/assets/publications/2007/2007-global-overview2006-global-en.pdf | format = PDF | access-date = 2014-05-06 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140506182020/http://www.internal-displacement.org/assets/publications/2007/2007-global-overview2006-global-en.pdf | archive-date = 2014-05-06 | url-status = dead }}p. 13</ref> Additionally, most official figures only include those displaced by conflict or natural disasters.

They have traditionally not distinguished between civilians who are internally displaced and those who remain in their homes.  In a 2006 policy statement, the ICRC stated: \n<blockquote>The ICRC's overall objective is to alleviate the suffering of people who are caught up in armed conflict and other situations of violence. To that end, the organization strives to provide effective and efficient assistance and protection for such persons, be they displaced or not, while taking into consideration the action of other humanitarian organizations.\nOn the basis of its long experience in different parts of the world, the ICRC has defined an operational approach towards the civilian population as a whole that is designed to meet the most urgent humanitarian needs of both displaced persons and local and host communities.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.icrc.org/Web/eng/siteeng0.nsf/htmlall/idp-icrc-position-030706/$File/2006_IDPs_EN_ICRCExternalPosition.pdf |format=PDF|title= ICRC Position on Internally Displaced Persons|accessdate=2007-10-23 |work=}}</ref></blockquote>\nHowever, its Director of Operations has earlier recognized that IDPs \"deprived of shelter and their habitual sources of food, water, medicine and money, they have different, and often more urgent, material needs.\"<ref>{{cite news|first=Jean-Daniel |last=Tauxe |title=We Should Have Humanitarian Access to Displaced Civilians |date=2000-03-01 |url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2000/03/01/edtauxe.t.php |work=International Herald Tribune |accessdate=2007-10-24 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061125150508/http://www.iht.com/articles/2000/03/01/edtauxe.t.php |archivedate=November 25, 2006 }}</ref>\n\n===Collaborative approach===\nThe previous system set up internationally to address the needs of IDPs was referred to as the collaborative approach as the responsibility  for protecting and assisting IDPs was shared among the UN agencies, i.e. UNHCR, [[Unicef]], [[WFP]], [[UNDP]], [[Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights]], the International Organization for Migration [[International Organization for Migration|IOM]], the ICRC and International [[NGOs]].

Roberta Cohen reports: \n<blockquote>Nearly every UN and independent evaluation has found the collaborative approach deficient when it comes to IDPs. To begin with, there is no real focus of responsibility in the field for assisting and protecting...There is also no predictability of action, as the different agencies are free to pick and choose the situations in which they wish to become involved on the basis of their respective mandates, resources, and interests.

IDP Supplement.

The cluster approach was conceived amid concerns about coordination and capacity that arose from the weak operational response to the crisis in Darfur in 2004 and 2005, and the critical findings of the Humanitarian Response Review (HRR) commissioned by the then ERC, Jan Egeland. Egeland called for strengthening leadership of the sectors, and introduced the concept of \"clusters\" at different levels (headquarters, regional, country and operational)\u2019.\n\nThe cluster approach operates on the global and local levels. At the global level, the approach is meant to build up capacity in eleven key \u2018gap\u2019 areas by developing better surge capacity, ensuring consistent access to appropriately trained technical expertise and enhanced material stockpiles, and securing the increased engagement of all relevant humanitarian partners. At the field level, the cluster approach strengthens the coordination and response capacity by mobilizing clusters of humanitarian agencies (UN/Red Cross-Red Crescent/IOs/NGOs) to respond in particular sectors or areas of activity, each cluster having a clearly designated and accountable lead, as agreed by the HC and the Country Team. Designated lead agencies at the global level both participate directly in operations, but also coordinate with and oversee other organizations within their specific spheres, reporting the results up through a designated chain of command to the ERC at the summit. However, lead agencies are responsible as \u2018providers of last resort\u2019, which represents the commitment of cluster leads to do their utmost to ensure an adequate and appropriate response in their respective areas of responsibility. The cluster approach was part of a package of reforms accepted by the IASC in December 2005 and subsequently applied in eight chronic humanitarian crises and six sudden-onset emergencies. However, the reform was originally rolled out and evaluated in four countries: DRC, Liberia, Somalia and Uganda.\n\nThe clusters were originally concentrated on nine areas: \n# Logistics (WFP)\n# [[Emergency Telecommunications Cluster (ETC)|Emergency Telecommunications Cluster]] (WFP)\n#[[Camp Coordination and Camp Management Cluster|Camp Coordination and Camp Management]] (UNHCR for conflict-generated IDPs and IOM for natural disaster-generated IDPs)\n# [[Shelter Cluster|Shelter]] ([[IFRC]] for natural disasters; UNHCR for conflict situations)\n# Health (WHO)\n# Nutrition (UNICEF)\n# Water, sanitation, and hygiene promotion (UNICEF)\n# Early recovery (UNDP); and\n# Protection (UNHCR for conflict-generated IDPs, UNHCR, UNICEF, and OHCHR for natural disaster generated IDPs).\n\nIASC Principles deemed it unnecessary to apply the cluster approach to four sectors where no significant gaps were detected: a) food, led by WFP; b) refugees, led by UNHCR; c) education, led by UNICEF; and d) agriculture, led by FAO.\n\nThe original nine clusters were later expanded to include agriculture and education.\n\n==International law==\nUnlike the case of refugees, there is no international universal treaty which applies specifically to IDPs. Only a regional treaty for African countries has been established (see [[Kampala Convention]]). Some other countries have advocated re-thinking the definitions and protections for refugees to apply to IDPs, but so far no solid actions have come to fruition.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Celik|first1=Ayse Betul|title=Transnationalization of Human Rights Norms and Its Impact on Internally Displaced Kurds|journal=Human Rights Quarterly|date=August 2005|volume=27|issue=3|pages=969\u2013997|jstor=20069817|doi=10.1353/hrq.2005.0032}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url= |ssrn=2617336|title=The New Refugees and the Old Treaty: Persecutors and Persecuted in the Twenty-First Century|first=Andrew I.|last=Schoenholtz|date=11 June 2015|publisher=}}</ref> Recognizing the gap, the UN Secretary-General, Boutros-Ghali appointed [[Francis Deng]] in 1992 as his representative for internally displaced persons.

may never have had property (e.g. in Afghanistan);\n* cannot access what property they have (Colombia, Guatemala, South Africa and Sudan);\n* ownership is unclear as families have expanded or split and division of the land becomes an issue;\n* death of owner may leave dependents without clear claim to the land;\n* people settled on the land know it is not theirs but have nowhere else to go (as in Colombia, Rwanda and Timor-Leste); and\n* have competing claims with others, including the state and its foreign or local business partners (as in Aceh, Angola, Colombia, Liberia and Sudan)\n\nResearchers at the [[Overseas Development Institute]] stress the need for [[humanitarian organization]] to develop a greater expertise in these issues, using experts who have a knowledge in

However, as Erin Mooney has pointed out, \"global statistics on internal displacement generally count only IDPs uprooted by conflict and human rights violations. Moreover, a recent study has recommended that the IDP concept should be defined even more narrowly, to be limited to persons displaced by violence.\"<ref>MOONEY, E. \"The Concept of Internal Displacement and the Case for Internally Displaced Persons as a Category of Concern.\" Refugee Survey Quarterly. (24) 3, 2005, p. 12.</ref> Thus, despite the non-exhaustive reasons of internal displacement, many consider IDPs as those who would be defined as refugees if they were to cross an international border, hence, the term refugees in all but name is often applied to IDPs.\n\n==IDP populations==\nIt is very difficult to get accurate figures for internally displaced persons because populations aren't constant. IDPs may be returning home while others are fleeing, others may periodically return to IDP camps to take advantage of humanitarian aid. While the case of IDPs in large camps such as those in Darfur, western Sudan, are relatively well-reported, it is very difficult to assess those IDPs who flee to larger towns and cities. It is necessary in many instances to supplement official figures with additional information obtained from operational humanitarian organizations on the ground.  Thus, the 24.5 million figure must be treated as an estimate.<ref name='IDMC 2006'>{{cite book | last = IDMC | first =  | authorlink =  | title = INTERNAL DISPLACEMENT Global Overview of Trends and Developments in 2006 | publisher = Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre, Norwegian Refugee Council | date = April 2006 | location = Geneva | pages =  | url = http://www.internal-displacement.org/assets/publications/2007/2007-global-overview2006-global-en.pdf | format = PDF | access-date = 2014-05-06 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140506182020/http://www.internal-displacement.org/assets/publications/2007/2007-global-overview2006-global-en.pdf | archive-date = 2014-05-06 | url-status = dead }}p. 13</ref> Additionally, most official figures only include those displaced by conflict or natural disasters.

They have traditionally not distinguished between civilians who are internally displaced and those who remain in their homes.  In a 2006 policy statement, the ICRC stated: \n<blockquote>The ICRC's overall objective is to alleviate the suffering of people who are caught up in armed conflict and other situations of violence. To that end, the organization strives to provide effective and efficient assistance and protection for such persons, be they displaced or not, while taking into consideration the action of other humanitarian organizations.\nOn the basis of its long experience in different parts of the world, the ICRC has defined an operational approach towards the civilian population as a whole that is designed to meet the most urgent humanitarian needs of both displaced persons and local and host communities.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.icrc.org/Web/eng/siteeng0.nsf/htmlall/idp-icrc-position-030706/$File/2006_IDPs_EN_ICRCExternalPosition.pdf |format=PDF|title= ICRC Position on Internally Displaced Persons|accessdate=2007-10-23 |work=}}</ref></blockquote>\nHowever, its Director of Operations has earlier recognized that IDPs \"deprived of shelter and their habitual sources of food, water, medicine and money, they have different, and often more urgent, material needs.\"<ref>{{cite news|first=Jean-Daniel |last=Tauxe |title=We Should Have Humanitarian Access to Displaced Civilians |date=2000-03-01 |url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2000/03/01/edtauxe.t.php |work=International Herald Tribune |accessdate=2007-10-24 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061125150508/http://www.iht.com/articles/2000/03/01/edtauxe.t.php |archivedate=November 25, 2006 }}</ref>\n\n===Collaborative approach===\nThe previous system set up internationally to address the needs of IDPs was referred to as the collaborative approach as the responsibility  for protecting and assisting IDPs was shared among the UN agencies, i.e. UNHCR, [[Unicef]], [[WFP]], [[UNDP]], [[Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights]], the International Organization for Migration [[International Organization for Migration|IOM]], the ICRC and International [[NGOs]].

Roberta Cohen reports: \n<blockquote>Nearly every UN and independent evaluation has found the collaborative approach deficient when it comes to IDPs. To begin with, there is no real focus of responsibility in the field for assisting and protecting...There is also no predictability of action, as the different agencies are free to pick and choose the situations in which they wish to become involved on the basis of their respective mandates, resources, and interests.

IDP Supplement.

The cluster approach was conceived amid concerns about coordination and capacity that arose from the weak operational response to the crisis in Darfur in 2004 and 2005, and the critical findings of the Humanitarian Response Review (HRR) commissioned by the then ERC, Jan Egeland. Egeland called for strengthening leadership of the sectors, and introduced the concept of \"clusters\" at different levels (headquarters, regional, country and operational)\u2019.\n\nThe cluster approach operates on the global and local levels. At the global level, the approach is meant to build up capacity in eleven key \u2018gap\u2019 areas by developing better surge capacity, ensuring consistent access to appropriately trained technical expertise and enhanced material stockpiles, and securing the increased engagement of all relevant humanitarian partners. At the field level, the cluster approach strengthens the coordination and response capacity by mobilizing clusters of humanitarian agencies (UN/Red Cross-Red Crescent/IOs/NGOs) to respond in particular sectors or areas of activity, each cluster having a clearly designated and accountable lead, as agreed by the HC and the Country Team. Designated lead agencies at the global level both participate directly in operations, but also coordinate with and oversee other organizations within their specific spheres, reporting the results up through a designated chain of command to the ERC at the summit. However, lead agencies are responsible as \u2018providers of last resort\u2019, which represents the commitment of cluster leads to do their utmost to ensure an adequate and appropriate response in their respective areas of responsibility. The cluster approach was part of a package of reforms accepted by the IASC in December 2005 and subsequently applied in eight chronic humanitarian crises and six sudden-onset emergencies. However, the reform was originally rolled out and evaluated in four countries: DRC, Liberia, Somalia and Uganda.\n\nThe clusters were originally concentrated on nine areas: \n# Logistics (WFP)\n# [[Emergency Telecommunications Cluster (ETC)|Emergency Telecommunications Cluster]] (WFP)\n#[[Camp Coordination and Camp Management Cluster|Camp Coordination and Camp Management]] (UNHCR for conflict-generated IDPs and IOM for natural disaster-generated IDPs)\n# [[Shelter Cluster|Shelter]] ([[IFRC]] for natural disasters; UNHCR for conflict situations)\n# Health (WHO)\n# Nutrition (UNICEF)\n# Water, sanitation, and hygiene promotion (UNICEF)\n# Early recovery (UNDP); and\n# Protection (UNHCR for conflict-generated IDPs, UNHCR, UNICEF, and OHCHR for natural disaster generated IDPs).\n\nIASC Principles deemed it unnecessary to apply the cluster approach to four sectors where no significant gaps were detected: a) food, led by WFP; b) refugees, led by UNHCR; c) education, led by UNICEF; and d) agriculture, led by FAO.\n\nThe original nine clusters were later expanded to include agriculture and education.\n\n==International law==\nUnlike the case of refugees, there is no international universal treaty which applies specifically to IDPs. Only a regional treaty for African countries has been established (see [[Kampala Convention]]). Some other countries have advocated re-thinking the definitions and protections for refugees to apply to IDPs, but so far no solid actions have come to fruition.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Celik|first1=Ayse Betul|title=Transnationalization of Human Rights Norms and Its Impact on Internally Displaced Kurds|journal=Human Rights Quarterly|date=August 2005|volume=27|issue=3|pages=969\u2013997|jstor=20069817|doi=10.1353/hrq.2005.0032}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url= |ssrn=2617336|title=The New Refugees and the Old Treaty: Persecutors and Persecuted in the Twenty-First Century|first=Andrew I.|last=Schoenholtz|date=11 June 2015|publisher=}}</ref> Recognizing the gap, the UN Secretary-General, Boutros-Ghali appointed [[Francis Deng]] in 1992 as his representative for internally displaced persons.

IDPs' and [[refugees]]' right of return can represent one of the most complex aspects of this issue.<ref name=ODI/>\n\nNormally, pressure is applied by the [[international community]] and [[humanitarian organization]] to ensure displaced people are able to return to their areas of origin and the same property.<ref name=ODI/> The UN Principles for Housing and Property Restitution for Refugees and IDPs, otherwise known as the Pinheiro Principles, provides guidance on the management of the technical and legal aspects of housing, land and property (HLP) restitution.<ref name=ODI/> [[Restitution]] rights are of key importance to IDPs and refugees around the world, and important to try preventing aggressors benefiting from conflict.<ref name=ODI/> However, without a clear understanding of each local context, full restitution rights can be unworkable and fail to protect the people it is designed to protect for the following reasons, refugees and IDPs:<ref name=ODI/>\n* may never have had property (e.g. in Afghanistan);\n* cannot access what property they have (Colombia, Guatemala, South Africa and Sudan);\n* ownership is unclear as families have expanded or split and division of the land becomes an issue;\n* death of owner may leave dependents without clear claim to the land;\n* people settled on the land know it is not theirs but have nowhere else to go (as in Colombia, Rwanda and Timor-Leste); and\n* have competing claims with others, including the state and its foreign or local business partners (as in Aceh, Angola, Colombia, Liberia and Sudan)\n\nResearchers at the [[Overseas Development Institute]] stress the need for [[humanitarian organization]] to develop a greater expertise in these issues, using experts who have a knowledge in both humanitarian and land and property issues and so provide better advice to state actors seeking to resolve these issues.<ref name=ODI/> The ODI calls on humanitarian agencies to develop an awareness of sustainable reintegration as part of their emphasis on returning IDPs and refugees home.<ref name=ODI/> Legal advice needs to be provided to all parties involved even if a framework is

In 1978 the Appeals Court of Bologna ordered three copies of the film to be preserved in the national film library with the stipulation that they could not be viewed, until Bertolucci was later able to re-submit it for general distribution with no cuts.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Rashkin|first1=Esther|title=Unspeakable Secrets and the Psychoanalysis of Culture|date=2008|publisher=[[SUNY Press]]|location=Albany, New York|isbn=0-7914-7534-4|page=224|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EuQmXl2j9cgC&pg=PA223|accessdate=24 March 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first=Bonnie|last=Malkin|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/dec/04/last-tango-in-paris-director-says-maria-schneider-butter-scene-not-consensual |title=Last Tango in Paris director suggests Maria Schneider 'butter rape' scene not consensual |work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|location=London, England |date=3 December 2016 |accessdate=8 December 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/hollywood-reacts-disgust-outrage-last-tango-paris-directors-resurfaced-rape-scene-confession-95 |title=Hollywood Reacts With Disgust, Outrage Over 'Last Tango in Paris' Director's Resurfaced Rape Scene Confession |magazine=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |publisher=[[Eldridge Industries]]|location=Los Angeles, California|date=3 December 2016 |accessdate=8 December 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|first=Seth|last=Kelley |url=https://variety.com/2016/film/news/last-tango-in-paris-rape-scene-consensual-bernardo-bertolucci-1201933117/ |title=\u2018Last Tango in Paris\u2019 Rape Scene Was Not Consensual, Director Admits |magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation]]|location=Los Angeles, California|date=December 3, 2016 |accessdate=December 8, 2016}}</ref>\n\nDuring her career, Schneider was a strong advocate for improving the quality and conditions of work for women in film.\n{{quote|I'm still struggling for the image of women in film and I'm still working, not as much as I would like to because for a woman in her late forties, it's hard to find work.

The beginning of the decade saw the actress appearing in a campy Belgian vampire comedy with [[Louise Fletcher]], ''[[Mama Dracula]]'' (1980), which received universally negative reviews from critics.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}} The same year, she performed alongside [[Klaus Kinski]] in the French thriller ''[[Haine (film)|Hate]]'' (''Haine'').\n\n1981 saw Schneider in ''[[Peacetime in Paris]]'', a Yugoslavian picture set in the French capital, which follows a documentarian researching the history of Nazism in Paris; there he meets and falls in love with Schneider's mysterious character, who helps him out on his quest. The picture won a Special Prize at the [[12th Moscow International Film Festival]], and also featured Schneider's father, [[Daniel G\u00e9lin]], in a supporting role as a taxi driver (none of his scenes, however, are shared with Maria.)\n\nIn 1982, she offered performances in two comedies, the Italian ''[[Looking for Jesus]]'' (''Cercasi Ges\u00f9''), with [[Fernando Rey]], and the French ''[[Stray Bullets (1982 film)|Stray Bullets]]'' (''Balles perdues''). Starting from 1984, Schneider began appearing more regularly in European television movies and shows, such as 1985's ''[[A Song for Europe (film)|A Song for Europe]]'' (or ''[[A Crime of Honour (film)|A Crime of Honour]]'') with a young [[David Suchet]] of ''[[Agatha Christie's Poirot]]'' fame, while doing supporting roles in cinematic turns like the Japanese production of ''The Princess & the Photographer'' (1984).\n\nTowards the end of the 1980s, Schneider had substantial roles in the French thriller ''[[R\u00e9sidence surveill\u00e9e]]'' (1987) and the post-apocalyptic surrealistic comedy ''[[Bunker Palace H\u00f4tel]]'' (1989) with three other legends of French cinema: [[Jean-Louis Trintignant]], [[Carole Bouquet]], and [[Jean-Pierre L\u00e9aud]] (the latter of which was Schneider's obsessive filmmaker fianc\u00e9 in ''Last Tango in Paris''.)\n\n== Personal life ==\nIn 1974, Schneider [[coming out|came out]] as [[bisexual]].<ref name=\"hadleigh\">{{citation |title=The Lavender Screen: The Gay and Lesbian Films |first=Boze |last=Hadleigh |authorlink=Boze Hadleigh |year=2001 |publisher=Citadel Press |isbn=0-8065-2199-6 |page=81}}</ref><ref name=\"abrams\">{{citation |title=America Transformed: Sixty Years of Revolutionary Change, 1941\u20132001 |first=Richard M. |last=Abrams |year=2006 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0-521-86246-9 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/unset0000unse_v9o6/page/165 165\u20136] |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/unset0000unse_v9o6/page/165 }}</ref> In early 1976, she abandoned the film set of ''[[Caligula (film)|Caligula]]'' (reportedly due to its pornographic content, apocryphally saying \"I am an actress, not a prostitute!\") and checked herself into a [[mental hospital]] in Rome for several days to be with her lover, photographer Joan Townsend.<ref>{{cite news |title=Interview with Maria Schneider |first=Roger |last=Ebert |authorlink=Roger Ebert|date=14 September 1975|accessdate=21 April 2007|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19750914/PEOPLE/509140301 |work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]}}</ref><ref name=\"alt4\">[http://www.altfg.com/blog/movie/maria-schneider-memoirs-of-a-french-whore-a-woman-like-eve/ Maria Schneider Pt. 3: Memoirs of a French Whore, A Woman Like Eve] ''Alt Film Guide'', 3 February 2011.</ref> This, coupled with her refusal to perform nude, led to Schneider's dismissal from the film.

In 1933, [[motorcycle]] racer, [[Erwin Baker]], had crossed the [[United States]] coast-to-coast in 54 hours. He earned the nickname, Cannonball, which spawned a number of race events in both the [[United States]] and [[Europe]] over the next few decades in his honor.

In 1933, [[motorcycle]] racer, [[Erwin Baker]], had crossed the [[United States]] coast-to-coast in 54 hours. He earned the nickname, Cannonball, which spawned a number of race events in both the [[United States]] and [[Europe]] over the next few decades in his honor. The Cannonball events were held in the 1970s, with the first prize being a [[gumball machine]]. It has been suggested, this is where Cooper got the name for the event from.<ref name=\"History of the Gumball 3000 Rally\">{{cite web|title=History of the Gumball 3000 Rally|url=http://www.gumball3000.ro/history/|website=Gumball 3000 Romania}}</ref>\n\nThe first event took place in 1999, with the 3,000 mile journey starting in [[London]], to [[Rimini]], [[Italy]] and then back.<ref>{{cite web|title=David Hasselhoff to join Gumball Rally in Capital|url=http://www.edinburghnews.scotsman.com/news/david-hasselhoff-to-join-gumball-rally-in-capital-1-3395293/|website=Edinburgh Evening News}}</ref> Cooper planned different events on each night of the rally, ranging from parties to dinner events.

He escapes and returns home to his mother, who puts him to bed after offering him chamomile tea. The tale was written for five-year-old Noel Moore, son of Potter's former governess Annie Carter Moore, in 1893. It was revised and [[self-publishing|privately printed]] by Potter in 1901 after several publishers' rejections, but was printed in a trade edition by [[Frederick Warne & Co]]. in [[1902 in literature|1902]]. The book was a success, and multiple reprints were issued in the years immediately following its debut. It has been translated into 36 languages,<ref name=\"MackeyP33\">{{Harvnb|Mackey|2002|p=33}}</ref> and with 45 million copies sold it is one of the [[List of best-selling books|best-selling books]] in history.<ref>Worker's Press</ref>\n\nSince its release the book has generated considerable merchandise for both children and adults, including toys, dishes, foods, clothing, and videos. Potter was one of the first to be responsible for such merchandise when she patented a Peter Rabbit doll in 1903 and followed it almost immediately with a Peter Rabbit board game.\nPeter Rabbit is a favorite for children of all ages the tales of which there are many are often read to children as 'bedtime stories' They however can be enjoyed by all ages through the hit movie that was released a few years ago.\n\n==Plot==\nThe story focuses on a family of anthropomorphic rabbits. The widowed mother rabbit warns her four rabbit children, Flopsy, Mopsy, Cottontail and [[Peter Rabbit|Peter]] not to enter the vegetable garden of a man named Mr. McGregor, whose wife, she tells them, put their father in a pie after he entered. Her triplets (Flopsy, Mopsy and Cottontail) obediently refrain from entering the garden, but Peter enters the garden to snack on some [[vegetables]]. Peter ends up eating more than what is good for him and goes looking for parsley to cure his stomach ache. Peter is spotted by Mr. McGregor and loses his jacket and shoes while trying to escape. He hides in a watering can in a shed, but then has to run away again when Mr. McGregor finds him, and ends up completely lost. After sneaking past a cat, Peter sees the gate where he entered the garden from a distance and heads for it, despite being spotted and chased by Mr. McGregor again. With difficulty he wriggles under the gate, and escapes from the garden, but he spots his abandoned clothing being used to dress Mr. McGregor's [[scarecrow]]. After returning home, a sick Peter is sent to bed by his mother, after she tells him that his jacket and shoes are the second jacket and pair of shoes that he has lost in a fortnight. His mother also takes note that he was not feeling too well, and deduces that he had definitely been to Mr McGregor's garden. To cure his stomachache, Mrs. Rabbit gives him [[chamomile tea]] which is revealed to be one teaspoon and gives a dose of it to Peter. Peter's sisters, meanwhile, receive a scrumptuous dinner of milk, bread and blackberries.\n\n==Composition==\nThe story was inspired by a pet rabbit Potter had as a child, which she named Peter Piper.<ref name=\"MackeyP35\">{{Harvnb|Mackey|2002|p=35}}</ref> Through the 1890s, Potter sent illustrated story letters to the children of her former [[governess]], Annie Moore. In 1900, Moore, realizing the commercial potential of Potter's stories, suggested they be made into books. Potter embraced the suggestion, and, borrowing her complete correspondence (which had been carefully preserved by the Moore children), selected a letter written on 4 September 1893 to five-year-old Noel that featured a tale about a rabbit named Peter. Potter biographer [[Linda Lear]] explains: \"The original letter was too short to make a proper book so [Potter] added some text and made new black-and-white illustrations...and made it more suspenseful. These changes slowed the narrative down, added intrigue, and gave a greater sense of the passage of time.

When Warne inquired about the lack of colour illustrations in the book, Potter replied that rabbit-brown and green were not good subjects for colouration. Warne declined the book but left open the possibility of future publication.<ref name=\"LearP146\">{{Harvnb|Lear|2007|p=146}}</ref>\n\nWarne wanted colour illustrations throughout the \"bunny book\" (as the firm referred to the tale) and suggested cutting the illustrations \"from forty-two to thirty-two ... and marked which ones might best be eliminated\".<ref name=\"LearP146\" /> Potter initially resisted the idea of colour illustrations, but then realized her stubborn stance was a mistake. She sent Warne \"several colour illustrations, along with a copy of her privately printed edition\" which Warne then handed to their eminent children's book illustrator [[L.

She further states Peter Rabbit's nature is familiar to rabbit enthusiasts \"and endorsed by those who are not ... because her portrayal speaks to some universal understanding of rabbity behaviour.\"<ref name=\"LearP153\">{{Harvnb|Lear|2007|p=153}}</ref> She describes the tale as a \"perfect marriage of word and image\" and \"a triumph of fantasy and fact\".<ref name=\"LearP154\">{{Harvnb|Lear|2007|pp=154\u2013155}}</ref>\n[[File:PeterRabbit15.jpg|thumb|left|Mr. McGregor tries to trap Peter under a garden sieve]]\n\nAccording to Stuart Jeffries, \"...psychoanalytic critiques of her work have multiplied since her death in 1943.\"<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/dec/07/booksforchildrenandteenagers Jeffries, Stuart. \"The ugly truth about Peter Rabbit ...\", ''The Guardian'', December 7, 2006]</ref> Carole Scott writes in ''Beatrix Potter's Peter Rabbit'' that the reader cannot help but identify with rebellious little Peter and his plight as all the illustrations are presented from his low-to-the-ground view, most feature Peter in close-up and within touching distance, and Mr. McGregor is distanced from the reader by always being depicted on the far side of Peter. Scott explains: \"This identification dramatically instills fear and tension in the reader, and interacts with the frequently distanced voice of the verbal narrative\", sometimes with contradictory effects.<ref name=\"MackeyP22\">{{Harvnb|Mackey|2002|p=22}}</ref> In the verbal narrative and the illustration for the moment when Mr. McGregor attempts to trap Peter under a garden sieve, for example, the verbal narrative presents the murderous intent of Mr. McGregor as a matter-of-fact, everyday occurrence while the illustration presents the desperate moment from the terrified view of a small animal in fear of his life \u2013 a view that is reinforced by the birds that take flight to the left and the right.<ref name=\"MackeyPP22-23\">{{Harvnb|Mackey|2002|pp=22\u201323}}</ref>\n\nIn the illustration of Peter standing by the locked door, the verbal narrative describes the scene without the flippancy evident in the moment of the sieve. The inability to overcome obstacles is presented in the verbal narrative with objective matter-of-factness and the statement, \"Peter began to cry\" is offered without irony or attitude, thus drawing the reader closer to Peter's emotions and plight. The illustration depicts an unclothed Peter standing upright against the door, one foot upon the other with a tear running from his eye. Without his clothes, Peter is only a small, wild animal but his tears, his emotions, and his human posture intensifies the reader's identification with him. Here, verbal narrative and illustration work in harmony rather than in disharmony.<ref name=\"MackeyP26\">{{Harvnb|Mackey|2002|p=26}}</ref> Scott suggests Potter's tale has encouraged many generations of children to \"self-indulgence, disobedience, transgression of social boundaries and ethics, and assertion of their wild, unpredictable nature against the constrictions of civilized living.\"<ref name=\"MackeyP29\">{{Harvnb|Mackey|2002|p=29}}</ref>\n\nFrank Delaney notes \"a self-containment\" in Potter's writing reflective of an uninterested mother and a lonely childhood spent in the company of pets.<ref>[http://publicdomainreview.org/2014/07/23/the-tale-of-beatrix-potter/ Delaney, Frank. \"The Tale of Beatrix Potter\", ''The public Domain Review'']</ref> John Bidwell, curator at the Morgan Library & Museum in New York, observed \"...the sardonic humor that makes Beatrix Potter so much fun for kids and grown-ups.\"<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/06/arts/television/peter-rabbit-on-nickelodeon-for-christmas-then-as-series.html Chozick, Amy. \"Bet Your Camomile Tea, Peter, You\u2019re a TV Star Now\", ''The New York Times'', December 5, 2012]</ref>\n\n== Adaptations ==\n\nIn 1938, shortly after the success of ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'', [[Walt Disney]] became interested in making an animated film based on ''The Tale of Peter Rabbit''.

He escapes and returns home to his mother, who puts him to bed after offering him chamomile tea. The tale was written for five-year-old Noel Moore, son of Potter's former governess Annie Carter Moore, in 1893. It was revised and [[self-publishing|privately printed]] by Potter in 1901 after several publishers' rejections, but was printed in a trade edition by [[Frederick Warne & Co]]. in [[1902 in literature|1902]]. The book was a success, and multiple reprints were issued in the years immediately following its debut. It has been translated into 36 languages,<ref name=\"MackeyP33\">{{Harvnb|Mackey|2002|p=33}}</ref> and with 45 million copies sold it is one of the [[List of best-selling books|best-selling books]] in history.<ref>Worker's Press</ref>\n\nSince its release the book has generated considerable merchandise for both children and adults, including toys, dishes, foods, clothing, and videos. Potter was one of the first to be responsible for such merchandise when she patented a Peter Rabbit doll in 1903 and followed it almost immediately with a Peter Rabbit board game.\nPeter Rabbit is a favorite for children of all ages the tales of which there are many are often read to children as 'bedtime stories' They however can be enjoyed by all ages through the hit movie that was released a few years ago.\n\n==Plot==\nThe story focuses on a family of anthropomorphic rabbits. The widowed mother rabbit warns her four rabbit children, Flopsy, Mopsy, Cottontail and [[Peter Rabbit|Peter]] not to enter the vegetable garden of a man named Mr. McGregor, whose wife, she tells them, put their father in a pie after he entered. Her triplets (Flopsy, Mopsy and Cottontail) obediently refrain from entering the garden, but Peter enters the garden to snack on some [[vegetables]]. Peter ends up eating more than what is good for him and goes looking for parsley to cure his stomach ache. Peter is spotted by Mr. McGregor and loses his jacket and shoes while trying to escape. He hides in a watering can in a shed, but then has to run away again when Mr. McGregor finds him, and ends up completely lost. After sneaking past a cat, Peter sees the gate where he entered the garden from a distance and heads for it, despite being spotted and chased by Mr. McGregor again. With difficulty he wriggles under the gate, and escapes from the garden, but he spots his abandoned clothing being used to dress Mr. McGregor's [[scarecrow]]. After returning home, a sick Peter is sent to bed by his mother, after she tells him that his jacket and shoes are the second jacket and pair of shoes that he has lost in a fortnight. His mother also takes note that he was not feeling too well, and deduces that he had definitely been to Mr McGregor's garden. To cure his stomachache, Mrs. Rabbit gives him [[chamomile tea]] which is revealed to be one teaspoon and gives a dose of it to Peter. Peter's sisters, meanwhile, receive a scrumptuous dinner of milk, bread and blackberries.\n\n==Composition==\nThe story was inspired by a pet rabbit Potter had as a child, which she named Peter Piper.<ref name=\"MackeyP35\">{{Harvnb|Mackey|2002|p=35}}</ref> Through the 1890s, Potter sent illustrated story letters to the children of her former [[governess]], Annie Moore. In 1900, Moore, realizing the commercial potential of Potter's stories, suggested they be made into books. Potter embraced the suggestion, and, borrowing her complete correspondence (which had been carefully preserved by the Moore children), selected a letter written on 4 September 1893 to five-year-old Noel that featured a tale about a rabbit named Peter. Potter biographer [[Linda Lear]] explains: \"The original letter was too short to make a proper book so [Potter] added some text and made new black-and-white illustrations...and made it more suspenseful. These changes slowed the narrative down, added intrigue, and gave a greater sense of the passage of time. Then she copied it out into a stiff-covered exercise book, and painted a coloured frontispiece showing Mrs Rabbit dosing Peter with camomile tea\".<ref name=\"LearP142\">{{Harvnb|Lear|2007|p=142}}</ref>\n\n==Publication history==\n\n===Private publication===\n[[File:1901 First Edition of Peter Rabbit.jpg|thumb|Cover of the 1901 privately published edition]]\nAs Lear explains, Potter titled ''The Tale of Peter Rabbit and Mr. McGregor's Garden'' and sent it to publishers, but \"her manuscript was returned&nbsp;... including Frederick Warne & Co.&nbsp;... who nearly a decade earlier had shown some interest in her artwork.

The necessity of protecting her intellectual property hit home after the successful 1903 publication of ''[[The Tale of Squirrel Nutkin]]'' when her father returned from [[Burlington Arcade]] in [[Mayfair]] at Christmas 1903 with a toy squirrel labelled \"Nutkin\".<ref name=\"LearP164\">{{Harvnb|Lear|2007|p=164}}</ref><!--this part really doesn't have to do with the American copyright-->\n\n==Merchandising==\n[[File:PeterRabbit8.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Peter feasts on Mr. McGregor's vegetables]]\n\nPotter asserted that her tales would one day be nursery classics, and part of the \"longevity of her books comes from strategy\", writes Potter biographer Ruth MacDonald.<ref name=\"Mac128\">MacDonald 1986, p. 128</ref> She was the first to exploit the commercial possibilities of her characters and tales; between 1903 and 1905 these included a Peter Rabbit stuffed toy, an unpublished board game, and nursery wallpaper.<ref>Lear 2008, pp. 172\u20135</ref>\n\nConsiderable variations to the original format and version of ''The Tale of Peter Rabbit'', as well as spin-off merchandise, have been made available over the decades. Variant versions include \"pop-ups, toy theatres, and lift-the-flap books\". By 1998, modern technology had made available \"videos, audio cassette, a CD-ROM, a computer program, and Internet sites\", as described by Margaret Mackey writing in ''The case of Peter Rabbit: changing conditions of literature for children''. She continues: \"Warne and their collaborators and competitors have produced a large collection of activity books and a monthly educational magazine\". A plethora of other Peter Rabbit related merchandise exists, and  \"toy shops in the United States and Britain have whole sections of [the] store specially signposted and earmarked exclusively for Potter-related toys and merchandise\".<ref name=\"MackeyPxxi-xxii\" />\n\nUnauthorized copying of ''The Tale of Peter Rabbit'' has flourished over the decades, including products only loosely associated with the original. In 1916, American Louise A. Field cashed in on the popularity by writing books such as ''Peter Rabbit Goes to School'' and ''Peter Rabbit and His Ma'', the illustrations of which showed him in his distinctive blue jacket.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hallinan|2002|p=83}}</ref> In an animated movie by [[Golden Films]], ''The New Adventures of Peter Rabbit'', \"Peter is given buck teeth, an American accent and a fourth sister Hopsy.\" Another video \"retelling of the tale casts Peter as a Christian preacher singing songs about God and Jesus.\"<ref name=\"MackeyPxxi-xxii\">{{Harvnb|Mackey|1998|pp=xxi\u2013xxii}}</ref>\n\n==Literary praise==\nWriting in ''Storyteller: The Classic that Heralded America's Storytelling Revival'', in discussing the difference between stories that lend themselves well to telling and stories that lend themselves well to reading, Ramon Ross explains Peter Rabbit is a story created for reading. He believes Potter created a good mix of suspense and tension, intermixed with lulls in the action. He goes on to write that the writing style\u2014\"the economy of words, the crisp writing\"\u2014lends itself well to a young audience.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ross|1996|p=210}}</ref>\n\nLear writes that Potter \"had in fact created a new form of animal [[fable]] in: one in which [[anthropomorphic]] animals behave as real animals with true animal instincts\", and a form of fable with anatomically correct illustrations drawn by a scientifically minded artist. She further states Peter Rabbit's nature is familiar to rabbit enthusiasts \"and endorsed by those who are not ... because her portrayal speaks to some universal understanding of rabbity behaviour.\"<ref name=\"LearP153\">{{Harvnb|Lear|2007|p=153}}</ref> She describes the tale as a \"perfect marriage of word and image\" and \"a triumph of fantasy and fact\".<ref name=\"LearP154\">{{Harvnb|Lear|2007|pp=154\u2013155}}</ref>\n[[File:PeterRabbit15.jpg|thumb|left|Mr. McGregor tries to trap Peter under a garden sieve]]\n\nAccording to Stuart Jeffries, \"...psychoanalytic critiques of her work have multiplied since her death in 1943.\"<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/dec/07/booksforchildrenandteenagers Jeffries, Stuart. \"The ugly truth about Peter Rabbit ...\", ''The Guardian'', December 7, 2006]</ref> Carole Scott writes in ''Beatrix Potter's Peter Rabbit'' that the reader cannot help but identify with rebellious little Peter and his plight as all the illustrations are presented from his low-to-the-ground view, most feature Peter in close-up and within touching distance, and Mr. McGregor is distanced from the reader by always being depicted on the far side of Peter. Scott explains: \"This identification dramatically instills fear and tension in the reader, and interacts with the frequently distanced voice of the verbal narrative\", sometimes with contradictory effects.<ref name=\"MackeyP22\">{{Harvnb|Mackey|2002|p=22}}</ref> In the verbal narrative and the illustration for the moment when Mr. McGregor attempts to trap Peter under a garden sieve, for example, the verbal narrative presents the murderous intent of Mr. McGregor as a matter-of-fact, everyday occurrence while the illustration presents the desperate moment from the terrified view of a small animal in fear of his life \u2013 a view that is reinforced by the birds that take flight to the left and the right.<ref name=\"MackeyPP22-23\">{{Harvnb|Mackey|2002|pp=22\u201323}}</ref>\n\nIn the illustration of Peter standing by the locked door, the verbal narrative describes the scene without the flippancy evident in the moment of the sieve. The inability to overcome obstacles is presented in the verbal narrative with objective matter-of-factness and the statement, \"Peter began to cry\" is offered without irony or attitude, thus drawing the reader closer to Peter's emotions and plight. The illustration depicts an unclothed Peter standing upright against the door, one foot upon the other with a tear running from his eye. Without his clothes, Peter is only a small, wild animal but his tears, his emotions, and his human posture intensifies the reader's identification with him. Here, verbal narrative and illustration work in harmony rather than in disharmony.<ref name=\"MackeyP26\">{{Harvnb|Mackey|2002|p=26}}</ref> Scott suggests Potter's tale has encouraged many generations of children to \"self-indulgence, disobedience, transgression of social boundaries and ethics, and assertion of their wild, unpredictable nature against the constrictions of civilized living.\"<ref name=\"MackeyP29\">{{Harvnb|Mackey|2002|p=29}}</ref>\n\nFrank Delaney notes \"a self-containment\" in Potter's writing reflective of an uninterested mother and a lonely childhood spent in the company of pets.<ref>[http://publicdomainreview.org/2014/07/23/the-tale-of-beatrix-potter/ Delaney, Frank. \"The Tale of Beatrix Potter\", ''The public Domain Review'']</ref> John Bidwell, curator at the Morgan Library & Museum in New York, observed \"...the sardonic humor that makes Beatrix Potter so much fun for kids and grown-ups.\"<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/06/arts/television/peter-rabbit-on-nickelodeon-for-christmas-then-as-series.html Chozick, Amy. \"Bet Your Camomile Tea, Peter, You\u2019re a TV Star Now\", ''The New York Times'', December 5, 2012]</ref>\n\n<br />\n== Adaptations ==\n\nIn 1938, shortly after the success of ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'', [[Walt Disney]] became interested in making an animated film based on ''The Tale of Peter Rabbit''. However, in a letter to a friend, Potter wrote that she refused Walt Disney's \"scheme to film Peter Rabbit\", saying, \"I am not very hopeful about the result. They propose to use cartoons; it seems that a succession of figures can be joggled together to give an impression of motion. I don't think the pictures would be satisfactory... I am not troubling myself about it!\"<ref>{{cite journal|title=Showing 'What a Woman Has Done\u2019: The Beatrix Potter Collections at the V&A|author=Laws, Emma|journal=Art Libraries Journal|issn=0307-4722|year=2007|volume=32|issue=1}}</ref>\n \nIn 1935, the story was loosely adapted in the ''[[Merrie Melodies]]'' short film, ''Country Boy''. It shows some modifications in relation to Beatrix Potter's original story, most notably the Rabbit family surname is changed to \"Cottontail\" and Peter having two brothers and a sister rather than 3 sisters. In 1971, Peter Rabbit appeared as a character in the ballet film ''[[The Tales of Beatrix Potter]]''.
