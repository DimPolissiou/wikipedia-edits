{"title_page": "Falklands Crisis (1770)", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2012}}\nThe '''Falklands Crisis of 1770''' was a diplomatic standoff between [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] and [[Enlightenment in Spain|Spain]] over possession of the [[Falkland Islands]] in the South Atlantic Ocean. These events were nearly the cause of a war between Britain and Spain \u2014 backed by France \u2014 and all three countries were poised to dispatch armed fleets to defend the rival claims to [[Sovereignty of the Falkland Islands|sovereignty]] of the barren but strategically important islands.\n\nUltimately, a lack of French support for Spain defused the tension, and Spain and Britain reached an inconclusive compromise in which both nations maintained their settlements but neither relinquished its claim of sovereignty over the islands.\n\n== Background ==\n{{main|Falkland Islands#History}}\n\n[[File:Egmont-Soledad.PNG|thumb|350px|Map of the Falkland Islands]]\nSeveral British and Spanish historians maintain their own explorers discovered the islands, leading to claims from both sides on the grounds of prior discovery.

Spanish objections to a planned British expedition had the effect of drawing up the battle lines and the matter was put to one side for the time being. An uncertain equilibrium might have remained but for the unexpected intervention of a third party, France.\n\nAfter the conclusion of the [[Seven Years' War]], the French were eager to improve their position in the South Atlantic. [[Louis de Bougainville]] landed in the Falklands in 1764, with the intention of establishing a permanent base at [[Port Louis, Falkland Islands|Port Louis]] on East Falkland. In 1765, the one unbeknown to the other, the British under [[John Byron]] made their own landing at [[Port Egmont]] off West Falkland. Responding to Spanish pressure, the French handed over Port Louis to their closest ally in 1767, and it was renamed [[Puerto Soledad]].\n\n== Crisis ==\n{{Further|Capture of Port Egmont}}\n\n[[File:Edward Hawke 1.jpg|thumb|right|[[Edward Hawke, 1st Baron Hawke]] the [[First Lord of the Admiralty]] who mobilised the [[Royal Navy]] during the crisis.]]\n\nIn June 1770, the Spanish governor of [[Buenos Aires]], Francisco de Paula Bucareli y Ursua, sent five frigates under General Juan Ignacio de Madariaga to Port Egmont.

She is the [[Figure skating at the 1976 Olympics|1976 Olympic champion]] and [[1976 World Figure Skating Championships|1976 World champion]] in ladies' couples.\n\n==Early life==\nHamill was born in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], to Chalmers and Carol Hamill. Her father was a mechanical engineer.<ref name=espn031119/> Shortly after her birth, her family moved to the Riverside neighborhood of [[Greenwich, Connecticut]], where Hamill spent the rest of her childhood. She has two older siblings, a brother, Sandy, and a sister, Marcia.<ref name=espn031119/>\n\nHamill first started skating in early 1965 at the age of 8, taking once-a-week group lessons. She became more serious about the sport the next season, taking regular private lessons and passing her preliminary and first figure test before the seasonal rink closed in March. She would wake early in the morning to go to the rink for practice at 4:30 am.<ref name=espn031119/> Hamill was first coached by [[Otto Gold]] and [[Gustave Lussi]]. Ice time was limited in her area, so she eventually began training at Sky Rink in [[New York City]], staying overnight in the city with friends when possible. In the summers, Hamill trained in [[Lake Placid, New York]] and later in [[Toronto]] with her coach at the time, [[Sonya Klopfer|Sonya Dunfield]].<ref name=competitor/> During her career, her father would spend up to $20,000 a year on her skating expenses, including skating lessons, travel, living expenses, and costumes.<ref name=espn031119/>\n\nUntil the spring of 1970, Hamill attended public schools in Riverside, but at that point she switched to a small school with flexible tutoring to accommodate her skating schedule. She attended and graduated from [[Colorado Academy]] high school.<ref name=competitor/>\n\n==Career==\nHamill's first national success came in 1969, when she won the novice ladies' title at the [[United States Figure Skating Championships|U.S. Championships]] at the age of 12. Later that spring, Hamill was invited to perform in [[Madison Square Garden]] with the exhibition tour (in later years known as [[Champions on Ice]]) that followed the [[1969 World Figure Skating Championships]]. She placed second at the junior level at the 1970 Championships, and made her senior debut in 1971.<ref name=competitor/> The [[U.S. Figure Skating Association]] arranged for her to be coached by [[Carlo Fassi]] when she began to compete internationally.<ref name=espn031119/>\n\nHamill was [[United States Figure Skating Championships|U.S. champion]] from 1974 to 1976. At the 1974 World Championships in [[Munich, Germany]], she was in 3rd place after the [[compulsory figures]] and the short program. She was set to skate directly after the German skater [[Gerti Schanderl]], whose marks were booed while Hamill was already on the ice. Visibly upset, Hamill left the ice and burst into tears. After the crowd settled down, she returned to the ice and won the silver medal behind [[Christine Errath]] of East Germany.\n\nHamill competed with an injured right leg at the 1975 U.S. Championships.<ref name=CSGT750303/> She said her leg was fine after receiving treatment for a pulled hamstring (earlier believed to be pulled ligaments) while training in Denver during the month before the [[1975 World Figure Skating Championships|1975 World Championships]].<ref name=CSGT750303/> She won silver at Worlds in Colorado Springs, Colorado, behind [[Dianne de Leeuw]] of the Netherlands and ahead of Errath.\n\nHamill was disappointed by her performance at the 1976 U.S. Championships, admitting that she was outskated by [[Linda Fratianne]] because she had not trained properly. Immediately after the national championships, her coach [[Carlo Fassi]] left the U.S. to accompany his other star pupil, [[John Curry]], to the [[European Figure Skating Championships|European Championships]], leaving Hamill coachless with the Olympics only a few weeks away. She began training with Peter Burrows instead. She was pleased with their work together and wanted to bring him to the Olympics as her coach of record.<ref name=espn031119/> However, the USFSA refused her request, and she was reunited with Fassi for a brief period of training in Germany before the Olympics.<ref name=espn031119/><ref name=skatinglife/>\n\nAt the [[Figure skating at the 1976 Winter Olympics|1976 Winter Olympics]] in Innsbruck, Austria, Hamill came in second in the figures and then won the short and long programs, taking the gold medal.

American [[figure skater]]. She is the [[Figure skating at the 1976 Olympics|1976 Olympic champion]] and [[1976 World Figure Skating Championships|1976 World champion]] in ladies' singles.\n\n==Early life==\nHamill was born in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], to Chalmers and Carol Hamill. Her father was a mechanical engineer.<ref name=espn031119/> Shortly after her birth, her family moved to the Riverside neighborhood of [[Greenwich, Connecticut]], where Hamill spent the rest of her childhood. She has two older siblings, a brother, Sandy, and a sister, Marcia.<ref name=espn031119/>\n\nHamill first started skating in early 1965 at the age of 8, taking once-a-week group lessons. She became more serious about the sport the next season, taking regular private lessons and passing her preliminary and first figure test before the seasonal rink closed in March. She would wake early in the morning to go to the rink for practice at 4:30 am.<ref name=espn031119/> Hamill was first coached by [[Otto Gold]] and [[Gustave Lussi]]. Ice time was limited in her area, so she eventually began training at Sky Rink in [[New York City]], staying overnight in the city with friends when possible. In the summers, Hamill trained in [[Lake Placid, New York]] and later in [[Toronto]] with her coach at the time, [[Sonya Klopfer|Sonya Dunfield]].<ref name=competitor/> During her career, her father would spend up to $20,000 a year on her skating expenses, including skating lessons, travel, living expenses, and costumes.<ref name=espn031119/>\n\nUntil the spring of 1970, Hamill attended public schools in Riverside, but at that point she switched to a small school with flexible tutoring to accommodate her skating schedule. She attended and graduated from [[Colorado Academy]] high school.<ref name=competitor/>\n\n==Career==\nHamill's first national success came in 1969, when she won the novice ladies' title at the [[United States Figure Skating Championships|U.S. Championships]] at the age of 12. Later that spring, Hamill was invited to perform in [[Madison Square Garden]] with the exhibition tour (in later years known as [[Champions on Ice]]) that followed the [[1969 World Figure Skating Championships]]. She placed second at the junior level at the 1970 Championships, and made her senior debut in 1971.<ref name=competitor/> The [[U.S. Figure Skating Association]] arranged for her to be coached by [[Carlo Fassi]] when she began to compete internationally.<ref name=espn031119/>\n\nHamill was [[United States Figure Skating Championships|U.S. champion]] from 1974 to 1976. At the 1974 World Championships in [[Munich, Germany]], she was in 3rd place after the [[compulsory figures]] and the short program. She was set to skate directly after the German skater [[Gerti Schanderl]], whose marks were booed while Hamill was already on the ice. Visibly upset, Hamill left the ice and burst into tears. After the crowd settled down, she returned to the ice and won the silver medal behind [[Christine Errath]] of East Germany.\n\nHamill competed with an injured right leg at the 1975 U.S. Championships.<ref name=CSGT750303/> She said her leg was fine after receiving treatment for a pulled hamstring (earlier believed to be pulled ligaments) while training in Denver during the month before the [[1975 World Figure Skating Championships|1975 World Championships]].<ref name=CSGT750303/> She won silver at Worlds in Colorado Springs, Colorado, behind [[Dianne de Leeuw]] of the Netherlands and ahead of Errath.\n\nHamill was disappointed by her performance at the 1976 U.S. Championships, admitting that she was outskated by [[Linda Fratianne]] because she had not trained properly. Immediately after the national championships, her coach [[Carlo Fassi]] left the U.S. to accompany his other star pupil, [[John Curry]], to the [[European Figure Skating Championships|European Championships]], leaving Hamill coachless with the Olympics only a few weeks away. She began training with Peter Burrows instead. She was pleased with their work together and wanted to bring him to the Olympics as her coach of record.<ref name=espn031119/> However, the USFSA refused her request, and she was reunited with Fassi for a brief period of training in Germany before the Olympics.<ref name=espn031119/><ref name=skatinglife/>\n\nAt the [[Figure skating at the 1976 Winter Olympics|1976 Winter Olympics]] in Innsbruck, Austria, Hamill came in second in the figures and then won the short and long programs, taking the gold medal. She was the last [[Single skating|single skater]] to win the Olympics without a triple jump.<ref name=espn031119/> Hamill also won the [[1976 World Figure Skating Championships|1976 World Championships]], and then turned professional.\n\nHamill is credited with developing a new skating move, a [[Figure skating spins|camel spin]] that turns into a [[Figure skating spins|sit spin]], which became known as the \"Hamill camel.\"<ref name=tpn121228/> The bobbed hairstyle that she wore during her Olympic performance was created by stylist Yusuke Suga <ref name=espn031119/> and started a fad, known as the \"short and sassy\" look.<ref name=hairfinder/> Her eyeglasses with oversized frames also started a trend in the 1970s.<ref name=espn031119/> The media dubbed her \"America's sweetheart.\"<ref name=tbs090922/>\n\nHamill was an [[Ice Capades]] headliner from 1977 to 1984. She was asked to join Ice Capades by Donna Atwood, who had been its star for years and who had eventually acquired financial control of the Ice Capades. Hamill was asked to be Atwood's successor as its new star.<ref>{{cite news\n|url=https://www.kabbage.com/blog/worst-celebrity-investments\n|title=The 7 Worst Celebrity Investments\n|accessdate=2013-04-28\n|website=Kabbage}}</ref> After Ice Capades folded due to competition and changing tastes, Hamill and her husband bought the financially strapped company's assets in 1993 in an effort to revive its earlier success, but they declared bankruptcy in 1994.

Edison Academy For Career & Technical Education was the center for vocational and technical education in the city.\n\nWilliams Field, which holds the school's football field and outdoor track and field, is adjacent to the Thomas A. Edison Academy.\n\n===J Christian Bollwage Academy of Finance===\nThe Sam E. Aboff Alternative House was the Elizabeth High School's smallest house in terms of both population and area. It was home to troublesome students and students who are excessively absent and/or tardy. It was located less than 100 yards from the Main Complex.\n\nIn 2009, each Elizabeth High School \"House\" was reformed into its own high school academy. The Sam E. Aboff House became the Halsey\nAcademy of Finance (AOF), a branch of The Admiral William F. Halsey Jr. Leadership Academy. AOF is the location of the Halsey Business Leadership Strand. The Halsey Academy of Finance can house a total of 200 students and all four grade levels of Business Leadership students.\n\nHalsey Academy of Finance is part of the [[National Academy Foundation]] (NAF). A number of the city's high schools have gone through the NAF's development process and received permission to establish NAF academies within their base schools.  NAF academies work with local businesses and higher education institutions to prepare students for careers in fields such as technology, engineering, business and finance and hospitality. The NAF curriculum engages students through a series of career exploration courses, mentorships, internships, and many opportunities for off-campus extended classroom experiences to give the participating students a better idea of the opportunities available to them in terms of further education and career fields. All NAF courses use project-based learning techniques with an emphasis on strengthening literacy. Halsey Academy established the NAF Halsey Academy of Finance on a campus directly across the street from the main Halsey building.<ref>[http://halsey.epsnj.org/pages/Admiral_William_F__Halsey_Jr__/Contents/Finance_Academy Business Leadership Strand at the Halsey Academy of Finance], Halsey Academy of Finance.

The Main Complex holds more students, teachers, and administrators than the other houses/campuses in the city. The Main Complex was known as the heart of Elizabeth High School.\n\nThe Main Complex is where all the Elizabeth High School extracurricular activities and sports teams are found. The building functions as a hub central as other students from the other Elizabeth High School houses come here during the after school hours. The Main Complex also holds Elizabeth High School's swimming pool where the swim team practices and meets are held.

NAF academies work with local businesses and higher education institutions to prepare students for careers in fields such as technology, engineering, business and finance and hospitality. The NAF curriculum engages students through a series of career exploration courses, mentorships, internships, and many opportunities for off-campus extended classroom experiences to give the participating students a better idea of the opportunities available to them in terms of further education and career fields. All NAF courses use project-based learning techniques with an emphasis on strengthening literacy.

The giant planets (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune) formed further out, beyond the frost line, the point between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter where material is cool enough for volatile icy compounds to remain solid. The ices that formed these planets were more plentiful than the metals and silicates that formed the terrestrial inner planets, allowing them to grow massive enough to capture large atmospheres of hydrogen and helium, the lightest and most abundant elements. Leftover debris that never became planets congregated in regions such as the [[asteroid belt]], [[Kuiper belt]], and [[Oort cloud]].

Because metallic elements only comprised a very small fraction of the solar nebula, the terrestrial planets could not grow very large. The giant planets (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune) formed further out, beyond the frost line, the point between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter where material is cool enough for volatile icy compounds to remain solid. The ices that formed these planets were more plentiful than the metals and silicates that formed the terrestrial inner planets, allowing them to grow massive enough to capture large atmospheres of hydrogen and helium, the lightest and most abundant elements. Leftover debris that never became planets congregated in regions such as the [[asteroid belt]], [[Kuiper belt]], and [[Oort cloud]]. The [[Nice model]] is an explanation for the creation of these regions and how the outer planets could have formed in different positions and migrated to their current orbits through various gravitational interactions.\n\nWithin 50 million years, the pressure and density of [[hydrogen]] in the centre of the protostar became great enough for it to begin [[nuclear fusion|thermonuclear fusion]].<ref name=Yi2001>{{cite journal |author1=Sukyoung Yi |author2=Pierre Demarque |author3=Yong-Cheol Kim |author4=Young-Wook Lee |author5=Chang H.

An associate gave him an Ambien tablet which \"knocked [him] out\", encouraging him to obtain a prescription. This was Eminem's first experience of drug addiction, which would affect him for several years. Near the end of production on ''Encore'', he would \"just go into the studio and goof off [with] a pocketful of pills\". Eminem began taking the drugs to \"feel normal\", taking a \"ridiculous amount&nbsp;[...] I could consume anywhere from 40 to 60 Valium [in a day]. Vicodin, maybe 30\". The drugs would put him to sleep for no more than two hours, after which he would take more. Eminem's weight increased to {{convert|230|lb|kg}}, and he was regularly eating [[fast food]]: \"The kids behind the counter knew me \u2013 it wouldn't even faze them. Or I'd sit up at Denny's or Big Boy and just eat by myself. It was sad\". Eminem became less recognizable due to his weight gain, and once overheard two teenagers arguing about whether or not it was him: \"Eminem ain't fat.\"<ref name=\"RS10\"/>\n\nIn December 2007, Eminem was hospitalized after a [[methadone]] overdose. He had first bought from a dealer who had told him it was \"just like Vicodin, and easier on [your] liver\". He continued to buy more until he collapsed in his bathroom one night and was rushed to the hospital. Doctors there told him he had ingested the equivalent of four bags of [[heroin]] and was \"about two hours from dying\". After missing Christmas with his children,<!-- What other children? So far, we've just read about Hailie. --> Eminem checked himself out of the facility weak and not fully [[Detoxification|detoxed]]. He tore the [[Meniscus (anatomy)|meniscus]] in his knee after falling asleep on his sofa, requiring surgery; after he returned home, he had a [[seizure]]. His drug use \"ramped right back to where it was before\" within a month. Eminem began to attend church meetings to get clean, but after he was asked for autographs he sought help from a rehabilitation counselor. He began an exercise program which emphasized running.
