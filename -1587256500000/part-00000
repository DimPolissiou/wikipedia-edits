My mom had me in a talent show, I was one of the winners. [An agent] had his friend there, who was the one that got me on [''All That'']. ... The process itself was, oh my gosh. We did 10 auditions. I thought I didn't have it. They had us doing improv, sketches, all kinds of stuff. I went in fully dressed as Urkel. I was doing character voices. I had the glasses, I had the suspenders, everything. You name it, I had it. I got called a couple months later like, \"Oh, you know you got it.\" It was crazy because it was a nationwide [search].<ref name=\"All That Oral History\" />| Bates}}\n\n{{quote|The reason I got the audition was 'cause I was in a drama competition for high school and my scene placed first in competition. So there's lots of different categories and all the first-place teams in all the categories had a showcase at Paramount Studios at like this little theater. And some of the producers for All That were there. So after that a few of us from the competition got called in to audition. So I just went on it like a total lark, not like it was some big deal. Just kind of a goof. And that was my first audition for All That.\n\nI wasn't nervous 'cause I wasn't really taking it seriously. But that, in hindsight, served me really well. I had one callback, which was a little more interesting. I mean, I had the feeling when I went back for the callback that I was gonna be cast. I can't necessarily explain it, but I just had this feeling like I'm gonna do this show. Which was really strange because I'd never done a show before. So I just went, I did the material, I met some more of the people and then I left.

It was like, you're miners, mining for gold in Sicily, and we'd have to figure it out. But that happened to be my favorite sort of thing that I'd always loved best...I had no idea what I was in for, but I knew it was going to be the ride of my life. I knew it was going to be fun. I never wanted anything as much before. This one felt like home, this one felt like me and I felt very excited.

The basic concept for the series was a half-hour show that featured a [[cold open]] (which featured the cast participating in varying juvenile acts in a [[green room]] or around the studio before the show starts), several different [[sketch comedy|sketches]]; including \"runners\" (short little sketches), and then a musical performance to close out the episode.<ref name=\"All That Oral History\" /><ref name=\"danwarp\" /> The main staple was the ''Vital Information'' sketch which would go on to be featured in every show through the end of the [[All That (season 6)|sixth season]] (some people compared it to the ''SNL'' longest running sketch [[Weekend Update]]).<ref name=\"All That Oral History\" /> Cast and crew flew out to [[Nickelodeon Studios]] at [[Universal Orlando Resort|Universal Orlando]] to shoot the pilot in front of a studio audience on January 17, 1994.<ref name=\"All That Oral History\" /> After filming was completed, the pilot was shelved as screenings did not test well with the focus groups,<ref name=\"All That Oral History\" /><ref name=\"danwarp\" /> consisting of children, both boys and girls in different age groups, that Nickelodeon used.

They continued their relationship with Thompson and Mitchell by co-executive producing and head writing the spin-off series ''[[Kenan & Kel]]'' and eventually writing the feature film ''Good Burger'' (1997) with Schneider.\n\nAfter production on the second season wrapped in 1996, the show moved out of the old Nickelodeon Studios at Universal Orlando Resort in Florida. The network, interested in moving production of their live-action series to the West Coast began scouting sound stages in California. Production for the third season was completed at the [[Paramount Pictures]] studio before Nickelodeon obtained a lease for the 6230 Sunset Boulevard facility.

The format of the series remained roughly the same as the original seasons, but episodes now featured a weekly host who would appear alongside the cast in sketches (the weekly host was gradually fazed out of the show later on).

I thought I didn't have it. They had us doing improv, sketches, all kinds of stuff. I went in fully dressed as Urkel. I was doing character voices. I had the glasses, I had the suspenders, everything. You name it, I had it. I got called a couple months later like, \"Oh, you know you got it.\" It was crazy because it was a nationwide [search].<ref name=\"All That Oral History\" />| Bates}}\n\n{{quote|The reason I got the audition was 'cause I was in a drama competition for high school and my scene placed first in competition. So there's lots of different categories and all the first-place teams in all the categories had a showcase at Paramount Studios at like this little theater. And some of the producers for All That were there. So after that a few of us from the competition got called in to audition. So I just went on it like a total lark, not like it was some big deal. Just kind of a goof. And that was my first audition for All That.\n\nI wasn't nervous 'cause I wasn't really taking it seriously. But that, in hindsight, served me really well. I had one callback, which was a little more interesting. I mean, I had the feeling when I went back for the callback that I was gonna be cast. I can't necessarily explain it, but I just had this feeling like I'm gonna do this show. Which was really strange because I'd never done a show before.

It was like, you're miners, mining for gold in Sicily, and we'd have to figure it out. But that happened to be my favorite sort of thing that I'd always loved best...I had no idea what I was in for, but I knew it was going to be the ride of my life. I knew it was going to be fun.

Ultimately hired were Chelsea Brummet, [[Jack DeSena]], [[Lisa Foiles]], Bryan Hearne, [[Shane Lyons]], [[Giovonnie Samuels]], and [[Kyle Sullivan]]. The format of the series remained roughly the same as the original seasons, but episodes now featured a weekly host who would appear alongside the cast in sketches (the weekly host was gradually fazed out of the show later on).

She was sweet and friendly until she reads letters sent in by clueless viewers. After reading a letter, Ashley would go on a tirade against the letter's author.\n* Detective Dan starring [[Josh Server]] as a hopelessly incompetent private investigator who frequently stumbled into a crime scene to make matters worse.<ref name=\"Complex 02\" />\n*Shark Cave starring Reece Caddell, Gabrielle Green, and Lex Lumpkin as [[Caveman|cave people]] judges who decide on items its creators hope will be a success in the future. This is a mash-up parody of [[Shark Tank]] and [[The Flintstones]]. \n* Everyday French with Pierre [[Escargot]], featured [[Kenan Thompson]], sitting in a bathtub filled with suds, wearing a raincoat and matching hat and swim fins on his feet. In the sketch, he would say silly phrases in poorly-pronounced French and translate them in English.\n* Know Your Stars is a recurring sketch that involved a random voice that made an impersonation of an individual with embarrassing, wacky, funny and untrue facts and info about a cast member or special guest.\n*[[Good Burger]] is a [[wikt:recurring|recurring]] sketch that took place at a fast food restaurant. The cashier, Ed (played by [[Kel Mitchell]] in Seasons 1\u20135 and [[Ryan Coleman]] in Season 9), was portrayed as a clueless teenager who always found a way to mess things up. A notable quote from Good Burger, stated by Ed in every sketch, was \"Welcome to Good Burger, home of the good burger, can I take your order?\" Good Burger was later made into a feature film.\n* The Loud Librarian starring [[Lori Beth Denberg]], as a [[librarian]] who would coincidentally yell out, \"Quiet, this is a library![sic]\" along with a variety of noisemakers whenever the silence in her library was accidentally violated.\n*Cancelled with Nathan starring Nathan Janak as himself who is in a hot tub on a tropical island and rants about things that bother him and should be cancelled.\n* Sugar and Coffee starring Lisa Foiles and [[Kyle Sullivan]] as extremely hyperactive hosts of their own talk show. The pair would eat pure sugar and drink massive amounts of coffee and then force their guests to do the same thing from giant orbs attached to the ceiling, which usually led to overactivity in the worst way.\n* Thelma Stump starring [[Jamie Lynn Spears]] as an extremely old woman who serves as a bodyguard and security guard for the backstage of ''All That''.\n* Vital Information is a recurring sketch that was the center piece of the show before the relaunch. Starring Denberg (for the first four seasons), [[Danny Tamberelli]] (for seasons five and six), [[Lil' JJ]] (in the tenth season), and Reece Caddell (in the eleventh season) deadpanned one liners, usually three in a row.\n* Miss Piddlin starring [[Kenan Thompson]] as the [[lunch lady]] at the school. The only thing she offers is [[peas]]. She gets extremely angry when someone or people reject her [[peas]].\n* Getting Rid of Your Stuff starring Kate Godfrey as Marie Kiddo (a parody of [[Marie Kondo]]) who host the show and visits other guests houses and schools and goes through various things that they own, she asked the guests if the item brings them joy if it does the item is kept, but if it doesn't bring them joy (even if it belongs to a family member or friend) she violently destroys the item and screams \"DESTROY!\"\n\n==Impact and legacy==\n''All That'' is highly regarded for its large diverse cast both in terms of ethnicity and gender.<ref name=\"Atlantic\">{{cite web|first=Jake|last=Flanagin|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2014/04/the-quiet-radicalism-of-em-all-that-em/360756/|title=The Quiet Radicalism of All That|work=[[The Atlantic]]|publisher=[[Emerson Collective]]|location=Washington DC|date=April 16, 2014|accessdate=March 13, 2015}}</ref> The show was praised in ''[[The Atlantic]]'' for breaking the classical norms set in children's TV with its cast, irreverent and unapologetic humor, and kid characters played by actual kids.<ref name=\"Atlantic\" />\n\nWhen ''All That'' debuted in 1994, television was still primarily segregated by race as shown by popular sitcoms like ''[[Seinfeld]]'' (where the cast is completely white) or ''[[Martin (TV series)|Martin]]'' (where the cast is entirely black); even ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' was dominated by white male comedians.<ref name=\"Atlantic\" /> Robbins, Schneider and Tollin wanted the show to reflect its audience and also sought out varying musical acts (alternative, hip hop and R&B among others) to embrace the diversity<ref name=\"Atlantic\" /><ref name=\"Complex\">{{cite web|title=Ready Yet?

Northwest of Darbun, two frame homes were completely leveled, one of which was removed off its foundation. A large hardwood tree was uprooted and lofted several feet in this area. One home was properly constructed while the other lacked proper anchor bolts. Based on this, engineers and forensic surveyors concluded the damage was of EF4 intensity. Continuing northeast, the tornado snapped or uprooted nearly every tree in its path. Around East Sartinville Road, the tornado rolled a strapped-down mobile home and tore the roof off a brick home.

Northwest of Darbun, two frame homes were completely leveled, one of which was removed off its foundation. A large hardwood tree was uprooted and lofted several feet in this area. One home was properly constructed while the other lacked proper anchor bolts. Based on this, engineers and forensic surveyors concluded the damage was of EF4 intensity. Continuing northeast, the tornado snapped or uprooted nearly every tree in its path. Around East Sartinville Road, the tornado rolled a strapped-down mobile home and tore the roof off a brick home.

Kentucky and Louisville first played against each other in 1913 but stopped playing each other in the 1920s, playing only twelve times between 1913 and 1983.   The rivalry was generally dormant with only occasional matchups until the teams met in the [[1983 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1983 NCAA Tournament]].  Since then, the two teams have met each year in late December or early January.\n\nMuch like the [[Iron Bowl]], the Kentucky\u2013Louisville rivalry is all the more intense because the two schools have consistently been among the nation's elite men's basketball teams for most of the last 50 years.  Both schools are also two of the most victorious programs in [[NCAA]] men's basketball history; Kentucky is #1 on the list of all-time [[List of teams with the most victories in NCAA Division I men's college basketball|winningest program]]s in [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] Men's Basketball and Louisville #26 (#10 including vacated victories).  Kentucky has eight national championships while Louisville has two (official)(3 including the vacated 2013 championship) national championships.\n\n===Cincinnati Bearcats===\n{{main|Cincinnati\u2013Louisville rivalry#Men's Basketball}}\n\nWhile predominantly a football rivalry, the proximity and long-standing conference affiliation of Cincinnati and Louisville made this into a key rivalry, particularly in the days of the [[Metro Conference|Metro]] and [[Big East Conference|Big East]] conferences.  This rivalry went on hiatus in 2014 when Louisville left the [[American Athletic Conference]] for the ACC.\n\n==Notable Cardinals==\n{{See also|List of University of Louisville people}}\n\n===Retired numbers===\n\n{| class=\"toccolours\"  style=\"float:right; width:250px;\"\n! colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align:center; {{CollegePrimaryStyle|Louisville Cardinals|color=white}};\"| '''Retired numbers'''\n|-\n!Number\n!Player\n!Years\n|- style=\"background:silver;\"\n| 8 || [[Charlie Tyra]] || 1954\u201357\n|-\n| 31 || [[Wes Unseld]] || 1966\u201368\n|- style=\"background:silver;\"\n| 35 || [[Darrell Griffith]] || 1977\u201380\n|-\n| 42 || [[Pervis Ellison]] || 1986\u201389\n|}\n\nLouisville basketball has honored four former players by retiring their numbers. These are the last players to wear these numbers for a Louisville men's squad:\n\n* '''Charlie Tyra #8''' \u2013 A consensus All-American during the 1956 and 1957 seasons, Charlie Tyra led the University of Louisville to its first NIT title in 1956 and was named the tournament's MVP for his performance. Tyra was named Helms Athletic Foundation All-American in his junior and senior years. One of only five Cardinals to record over 1,000 rebounds in his career, Tyra ranks as the all-time rebounder in U of L history with 1,617. During the 1955\u201356 season, Tyra pulled down 645 rebounds, a mark that has been bettered by only three other players in NCAA history. He set the Louisville record for most rebounds in a game when he pulled down 38 against Canisius during the 1955\u201356 season. In his four seasons with Louisville, he helped his teams to a combined record of 88\u201323 and three straight NIT appearances. Tyra ranks third in career free throws made (448), second in career rebounding average (17.0), fourth in career scoring average (18.2), eighth in career scorers (1,728 points) and eighth in field goals made (640). Tyra is one of only four players in UofL history to score 40 points or more in a game (achieved against Notre Dame when he hit 12 of 16 field goals and all 16 of his free throw attempts). Tyra died on December 29, 2006, at the age of 71. He was drafted #2 by in the [[Detroit Pistons]] in the [[1957 NBA draft]].\n* '''Wes Unseld #31''' \u2013 When Wes Unseld ended his career with the University of Louisville following the 1967\u201368 season, he left as the Cardinals' all-time leading scorer for a three-year player. Today, Unseld ranks 10th on the all-time scoring list, but his career point total of 1,686 is still tops for a three-year player. A consensus All-American during his junior and senior years, Unseld is one of only five other Cardinal players to pull down over 1,000 rebounds in his career. His 1,551 career rebounds ranks second behind Tyra's 1,617. Unseld began his senior season with a 45-point effort against Georgetown College, a UofL record that still stands today. Unseld, chosen as second player overall in the NBA draft by Baltimore, was honored on the All-Missouri Valley Conference team all three years at UofL and the Cardinals were 60\u201322 during his three seasons. During his junior year, Unseld led the Cardinals to a final No. 2 ranking in both wire service polls. Unseld's 20.6 scoring average still ranks as the top scoring average in Louisville history. His 18.9 rebounding average also ranks as the top average for a Cardinal. While playing on the Cardinals' freshmen team, Unseld averaged 35.8 points and 23.6 rebounds, and hit 68.6 percent from the field. \n* '''Darrell Griffith #35''' \u2013 The 1980 Player of the Year and consensus first team All-American led Louisville to four consecutive NCAA tournament appearances, winning the 1980 Championship as he had promised when he committed to his hometown Cardinals. Griffith's career 2333 points and single-season 825 points rank first in Louisville history. He scored in double figures in 41 straight games and 111 of his 126 games with the Cardinals. His play earned him the nickname \"Dr. Dunkenstein\".<ref>John Papanek. \"[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1124021/index.htm A Rookie Gives The Jazz Pizzazz]\". ''Sports Illustrated''. December 8, 1980. Retrieved on February 1, 2010.</ref>  He was drafted #2 by the [[Utah Jazz]] in the [[1980 NBA draft]].\n* '''Pervis Ellison #42''' \u2013 Ellison won the 1986 NCAA Tournament MOP award after leading the Cardinals to their second NCAA Tournament Championship. A consensus first team All-American in 1989, he is the only Louisville player to score 2000 points and grab 1000 rebounds in a career. His 374 career rejections rank first at Louisville and ranked Ellison third all time in the NCAA when he left in 1989. He was drafted #1 by the [[Sacramento Kings]] in the [[1989 NBA draft]].\n\n===Cardinals in the Hall of Fame===\nLouisville has three representatives in the [[Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame]]: Cardinal All-American and former Washington Bullets All-Star [[Wes Unseld]], who was inducted in 1988, former coach [[Denny Crum]], who was inducted in 1994, and coach [[Rick Pitino]], who was inducted in 2013.

Kentucky and Louisville first played against each other in 1913 but stopped playing each other in the 1920s, playing only twelve times between 1913 and 1983.   The rivalry was generally dormant with only occasional matchups until the teams met in the [[1983 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1983 NCAA Tournament]].  Since then, the two teams have met each year in late December or early January.\n\nMuch like the [[Iron Bowl]], the Kentucky\u2013Louisville rivalry is all the more intense because the two schools have consistently been among the nation's elite men's basketball teams for most of the last 50 years.  Both schools are also two of the most victorious programs in [[NCAA]] men's basketball history; Kentucky is #1 on the list of all-time [[List of teams with the most victories in NCAA Division I men's college basketball|winningest program]]s in [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] Men's Basketball and Louisville #26 (#10 including vacated victories).  Kentucky has eight national championships while Louisville has two (official)(3 including the vacated 2013 championship) national championships.\n\n===Cincinnati Bearcats===\n{{main|Cincinnati\u2013Louisville rivalry#Men's Basketball}}\n\nWhile predominantly a football rivalry, the proximity and long-standing conference affiliation of Cincinnati and Louisville made this into a key rivalry, particularly in the days of the [[Metro Conference|Metro]] and [[Big East Conference|Big East]] conferences.  This rivalry went on hiatus in 2014 when Louisville left the [[American Athletic Conference]] for the ACC.\n\n==Notable Cardinals==\n{{See also|List of University of Louisville people}}\n\n===Retired numbers===\n\n{| class=\"toccolours\"  style=\"float:right; width:250px;\"\n! colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align:center; {{CollegePrimaryStyle|Louisville Cardinals|color=white}};\"| '''Retired numbers'''\n|-\n!Number\n!Player\n!Years\n|- style=\"background:silver;\"\n| 8 || [[Charlie Tyra]] || 1954\u201357\n|-\n| 31 || [[Wes Unseld]] || 1966\u201368\n|- style=\"background:silver;\"\n| 35 || [[Darrell Griffith]] || 1977\u201380\n|-\n| 42 || [[Pervis Ellison]] || 1986\u201389\n|}\n\nLouisville basketball has honored four former players by retiring their numbers. These are the last players to wear these numbers for a Louisville men's squad:\n\n* '''Charlie Tyra #8''' \u2013 A consensus All-American during the 1956 and 1957 seasons, Charlie Tyra led the University of Louisville to its first NIT title in 1956 and was named the tournament's MVP for his performance. Tyra was named Helms Athletic Foundation All-American in his junior and senior years. One of only five Cardinals to record over 1,000 rebounds in his career, Tyra ranks as the all-time rebounder in U of L history with 1,617. During the 1955\u201356 season, Tyra pulled down 645 rebounds, a mark that has been bettered by only three other players in NCAA history. He set the Louisville record for most rebounds in a game when he pulled down 38 against Canisius during the 1955\u201356 season. In his four seasons with Louisville, he helped his teams to a combined record of 88\u201323 and three straight NIT appearances. Tyra ranks third in career free throws made (448), second in career rebounding average (17.0), fourth in career scoring average (18.2), eighth in career scorers (1,728 points) and eighth in field goals made (640). Tyra is one of only four players in UofL history to score 40 points or more in a game (achieved against Notre Dame when he hit 12 of 16 field goals and all 16 of his free throw attempts). Tyra died on December 29, 2006, at the age of 71. He was drafted #2 by in the [[Detroit Pistons]] in the [[1957 NBA draft]].\n* '''Wes Unseld #31''' \u2013 When Wes Unseld ended his career with the University of Louisville following the 1967\u201368 season, he left as the Cardinals' all-time leading scorer for a three-year player. Today, Unseld ranks 10th on the all-time scoring list, but his career point total of 1,686 is still tops for a three-year player. A consensus All-American during his junior and senior years, Unseld is one of only five other Cardinal players to pull down over 1,000 rebounds in his career. His 1,551 career rebounds ranks second behind Tyra's 1,617. Unseld began his senior season with a 45-point effort against Georgetown College, a UofL record that still stands today. Unseld, chosen as second player overall in the NBA draft by Baltimore, was honored on the All-Missouri Valley Conference team all three years at UofL and the Cardinals were 60\u201322 during his three seasons.

On display in [[Bedford Museum]], [[England]].]]\n\nThe ph\u00e9nakistiscope usually comes in the form of a spinning cardboard disc attached vertically to a handle. Arrayed radially around the disc's center is a series of pictures showing sequential phases of the animation. Small rectangular apertures are spaced evenly around the rim of the disc. The user would spin the disc and look through the moving slits at the images reflected in a mirror. The scanning of the slits across the reflected images keeps them from simply blurring together so that the user can see a rapid succession of images that appear to be a single moving picture.\n\nWhen there is the same number of images as slots, the images will animate in a fixed position, but will not drift across the disc. Fewer images than slots and the images will drift in the opposite direction to that of the spinning disc. More images than slots and the images will drift in the same direction as the spinning disc.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.stephenherbert.co.uk/wheelZOETROPEpart2.htm |title=Zoetrope 2 |first=Stephen |last=Herbert |website=www.stephenherbert.co.uk |access-date=20 August 2016}}</ref>\n\nUnlike the [[zoetrope]] and other successors, common versions of the ph\u00e9nakisticope could only practically be viewed by one person at a time.\n\nThe pictures of the ph\u00e9nakisticope became distorted when spun fast enough to produce the illusion of movement; they appeared a bit slimmer and were slightly curved. Sometimes animators drew an opposite distortion in their pictures to compensate for this. However, most animations were not intended to give a realistic representation and the distortion isn't very obvious in cartoonish pictures.\n\nThe distortion and the flicker caused by the rotating slits are not seen in most ph\u00e9nakisticope animations now found online (for instance the GIF animation on this page). These are usually animations created with software. These do not replicate the actual viewing experience of a ph\u00e9nakisticope, but they can present the work of the animators in an optimized fashion. Some miscalculated modern re-animations also have the slits rotating (which would appear motionless when viewed through an actual ph\u00e9nakisticope) and the figures moving across the discs where they were supposed to stand still (or standing still when they were supposed to move around).\n\nMost commercially produced discs are [[lithographic]] prints that were colored by hand, but also multi-color lithography and other printing techniques have been used by some manufacturers.\n\n==Invention==\n[[File:Phenakistiscope.jpg|thumb|Joseph Plateau's illustration in Corresp. Math. (1833)]]\n\nThe phenakisticope was invented almost simultaneously around December 1832 by the Belgian physicist [[Joseph Plateau]] and the Austrian professor of practical geometry [[Simon Stampfer]].\n\nAs a university student Plateau noticed in some early experiments that when looking from a small distance at two concentric cogwheels that turned fast in opposite directions, it produced the optical illusion of a motionless wheel. He later read [[Peter Mark Roget]]'s 1824 article ''Explanation of an optical deception in the appearance of the spokes of a wheel when seen through vertical apertures'' which addressed the same illusion. Plateau decided to investigate the phenomenon further and later published his findings in ''Correspondance Math\u00e9matique et Physique'' in 1828.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ezcDAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA393 |title=Correspondance math\u00e9matique et physique |publisher=Garnier and Quetelet |location=Brussels |language=French |page=393 |year=1828 |volume=4}}</ref> In a letter to the same scientific periodical dated December 5, 1829 he presented his (still nameless) [[Anorthoscope]], a disc that turns an anamorphic picture into a normal picture when it is spun fast and seen through the four radial slits of a counter-rotating black disc.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wDcDAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA121 |title=Correspondance math\u00e9matique et physique |publisher=Garnier and Quetelet |location=Brussels |language=French |page=121 |year=1830 |volume=6}}</ref> This invention was later marketed, for instance by Newton & Co in London.\n\nOn 10 December 1830 [[Michael Faraday]] presented a paper at the [[Royal Institution|Royal Institution of Great Britain]] called ''On a Peculiar Class of Optical Deceptions'' about the optical illusions that could be found in rotating wheels. He referred to Roget's paper and described his associated new findings.<ref>{{cite publication|url=https://archive.org/stream/journalofroyalin01roya#page/204/mode/2up|title=On a peculiar Class of Optical Deceptions|last=Faraday|first=Michael|date=February 1831}}</ref> Much was similar to what Plateau had published and Faraday not only acknowledged this publicly but also corresponded with Plateau personally and sent him his paper. Some of Faraday's experiments were new to Plateau and especially the one with a fixed image produced by a turning wheel in front of the mirror inspired Plateau with the idea for new illusions. In July 1832 Plateau sent a letter to Faraday and added an experimental disc with some \"anamorphoses\" that produced a \"completely immobile image of a little perfectly regular horse\" when rotated in front of a mirror.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Correspondence of Michael Faraday: 1832\u20131840 |chapter=Letter to Faraday |last=Plateau |first=Joseph |editor-first=Frank A.J.L. |editor-last=James |publisher=The Institute of Electrical Engineers |location=London |date=24 July 1832 |volume=2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9lknVoNGj30C&pg=PA107}}</ref> After several attempts and many difficulties he constructed a working model of the ph\u00e9nakisticope in November or December 1832.

Stampfer had thought of placing the sequence of images on either a disc, a cylinder (like the later zoetrope) or, for a greater number of images, on a long, looped strip of paper or canvas stretched around two parallel rollers (much like film reels). He also suggests covering up most of the disc or the mirror with a cut-out sheet of cardboard so that one sees only one of the moving figures and painting theatrical coulisses and backdrops around the cut-out part (somewhat similar to the later Praxinoscope-Theatre). \nStampfer also mentioned a version which has a disc with pictures on one end and a slotted disc on the other side of an axis, but he found spinning the disc in front of a mirror more simple. By February 1833 he had prepared six double-sided discs, which were later published by Trentsensky & Vieweg. Matthias Trentsensky and Stampfer were granted an Austrian patent (Kaiserlichen k\u00f6niglichen Privilegium) for the discs on 7 May 1833.<ref name=Stampfer1833>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xUk0AQAAMAAJ&lpg=PA2 |title=Die stroboscopischen Scheiben; oder, Optischen Zauberscheiben: Deren Theorie und wissenschaftliche anwendung, erkl\u00e4rt von dem Erfinder  |trans-title=The stroboscopic discs; or optical magic discs: Its theory and scientific application, explained by the inventor |first=Simon |last=Stampfer |language=German |publisher=Trentsensky and Vieweg |location=Vienna and Leipzig |page=2 |year=1833}}</ref>\n\nPublisher and Plateau's doctoral adviser [[Adolphe Quetelet]] claimed to have received a working model to present to Faraday as early as November 1832.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=nl&id=SrpZAAAAcAAJ&d&q=Quetelet |title=Annalen der Physik und Chemie |trans-title=Annual of Physics and Chemistry |language=German |first=Johann C. |last=Poggendorff |publisher=Johann Ambrosius Barth |location=Leipzig |year=1834}}</ref> Plateau mentioned in 1836 that he thought it difficult to state the exact time when he got the idea, but he believed he was first able to successfully assemble his invention in December.

In April 1833 Trentsensky applied for an Austrian patent (k.k. Privilegium) together with Stampfer, which was granted on 7 May 1833.

English editions were published not much later with James Black and Joseph Myers & Co. A total of 28 different disc designs have been credited to Professor Stampfer.\n\nJoseph Plateau never patented his invention, but he did design his own set of six discs for Ackermann & Co in London. These were published in July 1833 as ''Phantasmascope'' and later as ''Fantascope''. Ackermann & Co soon published two more sets of six discs each, one designed by [[Thomas Talbot Bury]] and one by [[Thomas Mann Baynes]].\n\nIn the meantime some other publishers had apparently been inspired by the first edition of Professor Stampfer's Stroboscopische Scheiben: \nAlphonse Giroux et Compagnie applied for a French import license on 28 May 1833 for 'Le Ph\u00e9nakisticope' and were granted one on 5 August 1833. They had a first set of 12 single sided discs available before the end of June 1833.<ref name=Figaro-1833-06-27>{{cite journal |url=http://gallicalabs.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k2678190/f3.zoom |title=Le Figaro : journal litt\u00e9raire : th\u00e9\u00e2tre, critique, sciences, arts, moeurs, nouvelles, scandale, \u00e9conomie |number=178 |language=fr|date=27 June 1833 |access-date=20 July 2016}}</ref> Before the end of December 1833 they released two more sets.\n\nBy 16 June 1833, Joh.

This version had uncut discs with pictures and a separate larger disc with round holes.

It is unlikely that much of this copying was done with any licensing between companies or artists.\n\nJoseph Plateau and Simon Stampfer both complained around July 1833 that the designs of the discs they had seen around (besides their own) were poorly executed and they did not want to be associated with them.\n\nThe ph\u00e9nakisticope became very popular and soon there were very many other publishers releasing discs with numerous names, including:\n* Periphanoscop \u2013 oder Optisches Zauber-theater / ou Le Spectacle Magique / or The Magical Spectacle (by R.S.

A common variant had the illustrated disc on one end of a brass axis and the slotted disc on the other end; this was slightly more unwieldy but needed no mirror and was claimed to produce clearer images.\n\nFores offered an ''Exhibitor'': a handle for two slotted discs with the pictures facing each other which allowed two viewers to look at the animations at the same time, without a mirror.\n\nA few discs had a shaped edge on the cardboard to allow for the illusion of figures crawling over the edge. Ackermann & Co published three of those discs in 1833, including one by inventor Joseph Plateau.\n\nSome versions added a wooden stand with a hand-cranked mechanism to spin the disc.\n\nSeveral ph\u00e9nakisticope projectors with glass discs were produced and marketed since the 1850s.<ref name=Herbertproj1>{{cite web |url=http://www.stephenherbert.co.uk/wheelPROJECTINGpart1.htm |title=Projection Phenakistoscope 1 |first=Stephen |last=Herbert |website=www.stephenherbert.co.uk |access-date=19 July 2016}}</ref>\n\nJoseph Plateau created a combination of his ph\u00e9nakisticope and his [[Anorthoscope]] sometime between 1844 and 1849, resulting in a back-lit transparent disc with a sequence of figures that are animated when it is rotated behind a counter-rotating black disc with four illuminated slits, spinning four times as fast. Unlike the ph\u00e9nakisticope several persons could view the animation at the same time. This system has not been commercialised;  the only known two handmade discs are in the Joseph Plateau Collection of the Ghent University.

Naylor in 1843 in the ''Mechanical's Magazine \u2013 Volume 38''. His letter was illustrated with a detailed side view of the device. Naylor suggested tracing the pictures of available phenakisticopes onto glass with transparent paint and painting the rest black.

Instrument maker Wenzel Prokesch made a first model for him which could only project images of a few inches in diameter. A more successful second model by Prokesch had a stationary disc with transparent pictures with a separate lens for each picture focused on the same spot on a screen. A limelight revolved rapidly behind the disc to project the sequential images one by one in succession. This model was demonstrated to the [[Austrian Academy of Sciences]] in 1853. Prokesch marketed the machine and sold one to magician Ludwig D\u00f6bler who used it in his shows that also included other magic lantern techniques, like [[dissolving views]].<ref name=Herbertproj1/>\n\nFrom around 1853 until the 1890s J. Duboscq in Paris marketed different models of a projection ph\u00e9nakisticope. It had a glass disc with a diameter of 34 centimeters for the pictures and a separate disc with four lenses.

On display in [[Bedford Museum]], [[England]].]]\n\nThe ph\u00e9nakistiscope usually comes in the form of a spinning cardboard disc attached vertically to a handle. Arrayed radially around the disc's center is a series of pictures showing sequential phases of the animation. Small rectangular apertures are spaced evenly around the rim of the disc. The user would spin the disc and look through the moving slits at the images reflected in a mirror. The scanning of the slits across the reflected images keeps them from simply blurring together so that the user can see a rapid succession of images that appear to be a single moving picture.\n\nWhen there is the same number of images as slots, the images will animate in a fixed position, but will not drift across the disc. Fewer images than slots and the images will drift in the opposite direction to that of the spinning disc. More images than slots and the images will drift in the same direction as the spinning disc.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.stephenherbert.co.uk/wheelZOETROPEpart2.htm |title=Zoetrope 2 |first=Stephen |last=Herbert |website=www.stephenherbert.co.uk |access-date=20 August 2016}}</ref>\n\nUnlike the [[zoetrope]] and other successors, common versions of the ph\u00e9nakisticope could only practically be viewed by one person at a time.\n\nThe pictures of the ph\u00e9nakisticope became distorted when spun fast enough to produce the illusion of movement; they appeared a bit slimmer and were slightly curved. Sometimes animators drew an opposite distortion in their pictures to compensate for this. However, most animations were not intended to give a realistic representation and the distortion isn't very obvious in cartoonish pictures.\n\nThe distortion and the flicker caused by the rotating slits are not seen in most ph\u00e9nakisticope animations now found online (for instance the GIF animation on this page). These are usually animations created with software. These do not replicate the actual viewing experience of a ph\u00e9nakisticope, but they can present the work of the animators in an optimized fashion. Some miscalculated modern re-animations also have the slits rotating (which would appear motionless when viewed through an actual ph\u00e9nakisticope) and the figures moving across the discs where they were supposed to stand still (or standing still when they were supposed to move around).\n\nMost commercially produced discs are [[lithographic]] prints that were colored by hand, but also multi-color lithography and other printing techniques have been used by some manufacturers.\n\n==Invention==\n[[File:Phenakistiscope.jpg|thumb|Joseph Plateau's illustration in Corresp. Math. (1833)]]\n\nThe phenakisticope was invented almost simultaneously around December 1832 by the Belgian physicist [[Joseph Plateau]] and the Austrian professor of practical geometry [[Simon Stampfer]].\n\nAs a university student Plateau noticed in some early experiments that when looking from a small distance at two concentric cogwheels that turned fast in opposite directions, it produced the optical illusion of a motionless wheel. He later read [[Peter Mark Roget]]'s 1824 article ''Explanation of an optical deception in the appearance of the spokes of a wheel when seen through vertical apertures'' which addressed the same illusion. Plateau decided to investigate the phenomenon further and later published his findings in ''Correspondance Math\u00e9matique et Physique'' in 1828.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ezcDAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA393 |title=Correspondance math\u00e9matique et physique |publisher=Garnier and Quetelet |location=Brussels |language=French |page=393 |year=1828 |volume=4}}</ref> In a letter to the same scientific periodical dated December 5, 1829 he presented his (still nameless) [[Anorthoscope]], a disc that turns an anamorphic picture into a normal picture when it is spun fast and seen through the four radial slits of a counter-rotating black disc.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wDcDAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA121 |title=Correspondance math\u00e9matique et physique |publisher=Garnier and Quetelet |location=Brussels |language=French |page=121 |year=1830 |volume=6}}</ref> This invention was later marketed, for instance by Newton & Co in London.\n\nOn 10 December 1830 [[Michael Faraday]] presented a paper at the [[Royal Institution|Royal Institution of Great Britain]] called ''On a Peculiar Class of Optical Deceptions'' about the optical illusions that could be found in rotating wheels. He referred to Roget's paper and described his associated new findings.<ref>{{cite publication|url=https://archive.org/stream/journalofroyalin01roya#page/204/mode/2up|title=On a peculiar Class of Optical Deceptions|last=Faraday|first=Michael|date=February 1831}}</ref> Much was similar to what Plateau had published and Faraday not only acknowledged this publicly but also corresponded with Plateau personally and sent him his paper. Some of Faraday's experiments were new to Plateau and especially the one with a fixed image produced by a turning wheel in front of the mirror inspired Plateau with the idea for new illusions. In July 1832 Plateau sent a letter to Faraday and added an experimental disc with some \"anamorphoses\" that produced a \"completely immobile image of a little perfectly regular horse\" when rotated in front of a mirror.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Correspondence of Michael Faraday: 1832\u20131840 |chapter=Letter to Faraday |last=Plateau |first=Joseph |editor-first=Frank A.J.L. |editor-last=James |publisher=The Institute of Electrical Engineers |location=London |date=24 July 1832 |volume=2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9lknVoNGj30C&pg=PA107}}</ref> After several attempts and many difficulties he constructed a working model of the ph\u00e9nakisticope in November or December 1832.

Stampfer had thought of placing the sequence of images on either a disc, a cylinder (like the later zoetrope) or, for a greater number of images, on a long, looped strip of paper or canvas stretched around two parallel rollers (much like film reels). He also suggests covering up most of the disc or the mirror with a cut-out sheet of cardboard so that one sees only one of the moving figures and painting theatrical coulisses and backdrops around the cut-out part (somewhat similar to the later Praxinoscope-Theatre). \nStampfer also mentioned a version which has a disc with pictures on one end and a slotted disc on the other side of an axis, but he found spinning the disc in front of a mirror more simple. By February 1833 he had prepared six double-sided discs, which were later published by Trentsensky & Vieweg. Matthias Trentsensky and Stampfer were granted an Austrian patent (Kaiserlichen k\u00f6niglichen Privilegium) for the discs on 7 May 1833.<ref name=Stampfer1833>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xUk0AQAAMAAJ&lpg=PA2 |title=Die stroboscopischen Scheiben; oder, Optischen Zauberscheiben: Deren Theorie und wissenschaftliche anwendung, erkl\u00e4rt von dem Erfinder  |trans-title=The stroboscopic discs; or optical magic discs: Its theory and scientific application, explained by the inventor |first=Simon |last=Stampfer |language=German |publisher=Trentsensky and Vieweg |location=Vienna and Leipzig |page=2 |year=1833}}</ref>\n\nPublisher and Plateau's doctoral adviser [[Adolphe Quetelet]] claimed to have received a working model to present to Faraday as early as November 1832.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=nl&id=SrpZAAAAcAAJ&d&q=Quetelet |title=Annalen der Physik und Chemie |trans-title=Annual of Physics and Chemistry |language=German |first=Johann C. |last=Poggendorff |publisher=Johann Ambrosius Barth |location=Leipzig |year=1834}}</ref> Plateau mentioned in 1836 that he thought it difficult to state the exact time when he got the idea, but he believed he was first able to successfully assemble his invention in December.

English editions were published not much later with James Black and Joseph Myers & Co. A total of 28 different disc designs have been credited to Professor Stampfer.\n\nJoseph Plateau never patented his invention, but he did design his own set of six discs for Ackermann & Co in London. These were published in July 1833 as ''Phantasmascope'' and later as ''Fantascope''. Ackermann & Co soon published two more sets of six discs each, one designed by [[Thomas Talbot Bury]] and one by [[Thomas Mann Baynes]].\n\nIn the meantime some other publishers had apparently been inspired by the first edition of Professor Stampfer's Stroboscopische Scheiben: \nAlphonse Giroux et Compagnie applied for a French import license on 28 May 1833 for 'Le Ph\u00e9nakisticope' and were granted one on 5 August 1833.

The set of ''Die Belebte Wunderscheibe'' in Dick Balzer's collection<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dickbalzer.com/Phenakistascopes.604.0.html |title=Phenakistascopes |website=dickbalzer.com |first=Dick |last=Balzer |year=2007 |access-date=20 July 2016}}</ref> shows several discs with designs that are very similar to those of Stampfer and about half of them are also very similar to those of Giroux's first set. \nIt is unclear where these early designs (other than Stampfer's) originated, but many of them would be repeated on many discs of many other publishers. It is unlikely that much of this copying was done with any licensing between companies or artists.\n\nJoseph Plateau and Simon Stampfer both complained around July 1833 that the designs of the discs they had seen around (besides their own) were poorly executed and they did not want to be associated with them.\n\nThe ph\u00e9nakisticope became very popular and soon there were very many other publishers releasing discs with numerous names, including:\n* Periphanoscop \u2013 oder Optisches Zauber-theater / ou Le Spectacle Magique / or The Magical Spectacle (by R.S. Siebenmann, Arau, August 1833) \n* Toover-schijf (by A. van Emden, Amsterdam, August 1833)\n* Fores's Moving Panorama, or Optical Illusions (London, September 1833)\n* The Phenakistiscope or Magic Disc (by Forrester & Nichol & John Dunn, September 1833)\n* Motoscope, of wonderschijf (Amsterdam, September 1833)\n* McLean's Optical Illusions, or, Magic Panorama (London, November 1833)\n* Le Fantascope (by Dero-Becker, Belgium, December 1833)\n* The Phenakisticope, or Living Picture (by W.

A common variant had the illustrated disc on one end of a brass axis and the slotted disc on the other end; this was slightly more unwieldy but needed no mirror and was claimed to produce clearer images.\n\nFores offered an ''Exhibitor'': a handle for two slotted discs with the pictures facing each other which allowed two viewers to look at the animations at the same time, without a mirror.\n\nA few discs had a shaped edge on the cardboard to allow for the illusion of figures crawling over the edge. Ackermann & Co published three of those discs in 1833, including one by inventor Joseph Plateau.\n\nSome versions added a wooden stand with a hand-cranked mechanism to spin the disc.\n\nSeveral ph\u00e9nakisticope projectors with glass discs were produced and marketed since the 1850s.<ref name=Herbertproj1>{{cite web |url=http://www.stephenherbert.co.uk/wheelPROJECTINGpart1.htm |title=Projection Phenakistoscope 1 |first=Stephen |last=Herbert |website=www.stephenherbert.co.uk |access-date=19 July 2016}}</ref>\n\nJoseph Plateau created a combination of his ph\u00e9nakisticope and his [[Anorthoscope]] sometime between 1844 and 1849, resulting in a back-lit transparent disc with a sequence of figures that are animated when it is rotated behind a counter-rotating black disc with four illuminated slits, spinning four times as fast. Unlike the ph\u00e9nakisticope several persons could view the animation at the same time. This system has not been commercialised;  the only known two handmade discs are in the Joseph Plateau Collection of the Ghent University. Belgian painter [[Jean Baptiste Madou]] created the first images on these discs and Plateau painted the successive parts.<ref name=notices1849>{{cite publication|title=Sur de nouvelles applications curieuses de la persistance des impressions|language=French|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=L11NAAAAcAAJ&dq=%22royale%20de%20belgique%22%20plateau%20%22sur%20de%20nouvelles%20applications%20curieuses%20de%20la%20persistance%20des%20impressions%22&hl=nl&pg=PT113#v=onepage&q&f=false|last=Plateau|first=Joseph}}</ref><ref name=dorikens>{{cite book|title=Joseph Plateau 1801\u20131883: Living between Art and Science|last=Dorikens|first=Maurice|year=2001}}</ref>\n\nIn 1849 Joseph Plateau discussed the possibilities of combining the ph\u00e9nakisticope with the [[stereoscope]] as suggested to him by its inventor [[Charles Wheatstone]].<ref name=notices1849/> In 1852 Duboscq patented such a \"St\u00e9r\u00e9oscope-fantascope, st\u00e9r\u00e9ofantscope ou B\u00efoscope\". Of three planned variations only one was actually produced but without much success. Only one extant disc is known, which is in the Plateau collection of Ghent University.<ref name=dorikens/>\n\n== Projection ==\nThe first known plan for a ph\u00e9nakisticope projector with a transparent disc was made by Englishman T.W. Naylor in 1843 in the ''Mechanical's Magazine \u2013 Volume 38''. His letter was illustrated with a detailed side view of the device. Naylor suggested tracing the pictures of available phenakisticopes onto glass with transparent paint and painting the rest black. Nothing else is known of Naylor or his machine.<ref name=Herbertproj1/><ref>{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=3XY4AAAAMAAJ&pg=PA319 |title=Phantasmagoria for the exhibition of moving figures |first=T.W. |last=Naylor |journal=Mechanis Magazine |editor=J.C. Robertsone |publisher=James Bounsall |location=London |number=1027 |page=319 |date=15 April 1843}}</ref>\n\n[[Franz von Uchatius]] possibly read about Naylor's idea in German or Austrian technical journals and started to develop his own version around 1851. Instrument maker Wenzel Prokesch made a first model for him which could only project images of a few inches in diameter. A more successful second model by Prokesch had a stationary disc with transparent pictures with a separate lens for each picture focused on the same spot on a screen. A limelight revolved rapidly behind the disc to project the sequential images one by one in succession. This model was demonstrated to the [[Austrian Academy of Sciences]] in 1853. Prokesch marketed the machine and sold one to magician Ludwig D\u00f6bler who used it in his shows that also included other magic lantern techniques, like [[dissolving views]].<ref name=Herbertproj1/>\n\nFrom around 1853 until the 1890s J. Duboscq in Paris marketed different models of a projection ph\u00e9nakisticope. It had a glass disc with a diameter of 34 centimeters for the pictures and a separate disc with four lenses. The discs rotated at different speeds.<ref name=Herbertproj1/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cinematheque.fr/fr/catalogues/appareils/collection/phenakistiscope-de-projectionap-95-1631.html |title=Ph\u00e9nakistiscope de projection (AP-95-1631) |language=French |publisher=La Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que Fran\u00e7aise |access-date=4 June 2017}}</ref>\n\nAn \"Optical Instrument\" was patented in the U.S. in 1869 by O.B. Brown, using a phenakistiscope-like disc with a technique very close to the later cinematograph; with Maltese Cross motion; a star-wheel and pin being used for intermittent motion, and a two-sector shutter.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.google.com/patents/US93594 |title=U.S. Patent No. 93,594 |date=10 August 1869}}</ref>\n\nThomas Ross developed a small transparent ph\u00e9nakisticope system, called ''Wheel of life'', which fitted inside a standard magic lantern slide. A first version, patented in 1869, had a glass disc with eight phases of a movement and a counter-rotating glass shutter disc with eight apertures. The discs depicted Ice Skaters, Fishes, Giant's Ladder, Bottle Imp and other subjects. An improved version had 13 images and a single slot shutter disc and received British Patent 2685 on 10 October 1871.<ref name=Herbertproj1/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://collection.sciencemuseum.org.uk/objects/co8085514/ross-wheel-of-life-magic-lantern-slide-magic-lantern-slide |title=Ross 'Wheel of Life' magic lantern slide |publisher=Science Museum Group |location=London |access-date=4 June 2017}}</ref>\n\nHenry Renno Heyl presented his ''Phasmatrope'' on 5 February 1870 at the Philadelphia Academy of Music. This modified magic lantern had a wheel that could hold 16 photographic slides and a shutter. The wheel was rotated in front of the light source by an intermittent mechanism to project the slides successively (probably with a speed of 3 fps<ref name=pony>{{cite web |url=https://ejmuybridge.wordpress.com/2010/01/ |title=Leland Stanford Jr, on his pony |first=Stephen  |last=Herbert |work=Muy Blog |location=UK |date=27 January 2010 |access-date=4 June 2017}}</ref>). The program contained three subjects: All Right (a popular Japanese acrobat), [[Brother Jonathan]] and a waltzing couple. Brother Jonathan addressed the audience with a voice actor behind the screen and professed that \"this art will rapidly develop into one of the greatest merit for instruction and enjoyment.\" The pictures of the waltzing couple survived and consist of four shots of costumed dancers (Heyl and a female dancing partner) that were repeated four times in the wheel. The pictures were posed. Capturing movement with \"instantaneous photography\" would first be established by Eadward Muybridge in 1878.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IEUMWToGOtUC&lpg=PA47&ots=BtJIV-uESE&dq=heyl%20phasmatrope&pg=PA47#v=onepage&q=heyl%20phasmatrope&f=false |title=The Emergence of Cinema: The American Screen to 1907 |volume=1 |page=47 |first=Charles |last=Musser |publisher=University of California Press |year=1990 |access-date=4 June 2017}}</ref>\n\n[[Eadward Muybridge]] created his ''[[Zoopraxiscope]]'' in 1879 and lectured until 1894 with this projector for glass discs on which pictures in transparent paint were derived from his chronophotographic plates.\n\n== Scientific use ==\nThe ph\u00e9nakisticope was invented through scientific research into optical illusions and published as such, but soon the device was marketed very successfully as an entertaining novelty toy. After the novelty wore off it became mostly regarded as a toy for children, but it still proved to be a useful demonstration tool for some scientists.\n\nThe Czech physiologist [[Jan Evangelista Purkyn\u011b|Jan Purkyn\u011b]] used his version, called Phorolyt, in lectures since 1837.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d9xDAQAAMAAJ&pg=RA4-PA62 |title=Uebersicht der Arbeiten und Ver\u00e4nderungen im Jahre 1841 |trans-title=Overview of works and changes in the year 1841 |pages=62\u201363 |language=German |location=Breslau |year=1842}}\n</ref> In 1861 one of the subjects he illustrated was the beating of a heart.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cinematheque.fr/fr/catalogues/appareils/collection/phenakistiscope-disque-de-ap-94-374.html |title=Phenakistiscope (disque de) AP-94-374 |trans-title=Phenakistiscope (disk) AP-94-374 |language=French |publisher=La Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que Fran\u00e7aise |access-date=20 July 2016}}</ref>\n\nGerman physicist [[Johann Heinrich Jakob M\u00fcller]] published a set of 8 discs depicting several wave motions (waves of sound, air, water, etcetera) with J.V.

The results were not always very scientific; he often edited his photographic sequences for aesthetic reasons and for the glass discs he sometimes even reworked images from multiple photographs into new combinations. An entertaining example is the sequence of a man somersaulting over a bull chased by a dog.<ref name=pony/> For only one disc he chose a photographic representation; the sequence of a running horse skeleton, which was probably too detailed to be painted on glass. This disc was most likely the very first time a [[stop motion]] technique was successfully applied. Muybridge first called his apparatus Zoogyroscope, but soon settled on the name Zo\u00f6praxiscope. He used it in countless lectures on human and animal locomotion between 1880 and 1895.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.stephenherbert.co.uk/mZoo.htm |title=Compleat Eadweard Muybridge \u2013 Zoopraxiscope Story |first=Stephen |last=Herbert |website=www.stephenherbert.co.uk |access-date=19 July 2016}}</ref>\n\n==20th and 21st centuries==\nThe [[Joseph Plateau Award]], a trophy resembling a ph\u00e9nakisticope, was a Belgian movie award given yearly between 1985 and 2006.\n\nSeveral vinyl music releases have ph\u00e9nakistiscope-like animations on the labels or on the vinyl itself. In 1956 Red Raven Movie Records started a series of 78 RPM 8\" singles with animations to be viewed with a device with small mirrors similar to a [[praxinoscope]] to be placed on the center of the disc.
