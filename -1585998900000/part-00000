The spellings listed below are from the [[Oxford English Dictionary]]. Plurals of consonant names are formed by adding ''-s'' (e.g., ''bees, efs, ems'') or ''-es'' in the cases of ''aitch, ess'', and ''ex'' (i.e., ''aitches, esses, exes''). Plurals of vowel names add ''-es'' (i.e., ''aes, ees, ies, oes, ues''), but these are rare.

(See [[Latin alphabet#Origins|Latin alphabet: Origins]].)\n\nThe regular phonological developments (in rough chronological order) are:\n* palatalization before front vowels of Latin {{IPA|/k/}} successively to {{IPA|/t\u0283/}}, {{IPA|/ts/}}, and finally to Middle French {{IPA|/s/}}. Affects C.\n* palatalization before front vowels of Latin {{IPA|/\u0261/}} to Proto-Romance and Middle French {{IPA|/d\u0292/}}. Affects G.\n* fronting of Latin {{IPA|/u\u02d0/}} to Middle French {{IPA|/y\u02d0/}}, becoming Middle English {{IPA|/iw/}} and then Modern English {{IPA|/ju\u02d0/}}. Affects Q, U.\n* the inconsistent lowering of Middle English {{IPA|/\u025br/}} to {{IPA|/ar/}}. Affects R.\n* the [[Great Vowel Shift]], shifting all Middle English long vowels. Affects A, B, C, D, E, G, H, I, K, O, P, T, and presumably Y.\n\nThe novel forms are ''aitch'', a regular development of Medieval Latin ''acca''; ''jay'', a new letter presumably vocalized like neighboring ''kay'' to avoid confusion with established ''gee'' (the other name, ''jy'', was taken from French); ''vee'', a new letter named by analogy with the majority; ''double-u'', a new letter, self-explanatory (the name of Latin V was ''\u016b''); ''wye'', of obscure origin but with an antecedent in Old French ''wi''; ''izzard'', from the Romance phrase ''i zed'' or ''i zeto'' \"and Z\" said when reciting the alphabet''; and zee'', an American levelling of ''zed'' by analogy with other consonants.\n\nSome groups of letters, such as ''pee'' and ''bee'', or ''em'' and ''en'', are easily confused in speech, especially when heard over the telephone or a radio communications link.  [[Spelling alphabet]]s such as the [[ICAO spelling alphabet]], used by [[aircraft]] pilots, police and others, are designed to eliminate this potential confusion by giving each letter a name that sounds quite different from any other.\n\n===Ampersand===\nThe [[ampersand]] (&) has sometimes appeared at the end of the English alphabet, as in Byrhtfer\u00f0's list of letters in 1011.<ref name=\"Evertype\" /> ''&'' was regarded as the 27th letter of the English alphabet, as taught to children in the US and elsewhere. An example may be seen in M. B. Moore's 1863 book ''The Dixie Primer, for the Little Folks''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://docsouth.unc.edu/imls/moore/moore.html#moore5|work=Branson, Farrar & Co., Raleigh NC|title=The Dixie Primer, for the Little Folks}}</ref> Historically, the figure is a [[Typographic ligature|ligature]] for the letters ''Et''. In English and many other languages it is used to represent the word ''and'' and occasionally the Latin word ''et'', as in the abbreviation ''&c'' (et cetera).<!---and is used for other purposes, too. & is on a normal keyboard with the combo SHIFT + 7--->\n\n===Archaic letters===\n[[Old English|Old]] and [[Middle English]] had a number of non-Latin letters that have since dropped out of use. These either took the names of the equivalent [[Anglo-Saxon runes|runes]], since there were no Latin names to adopt, or (thorn, wyn) were runes themselves. \n*\u00c6 \u00e6 ''[[ash (letter)|ash]]'' {{IPAc-en|'|\u00e6|\u0283}}, used for the vowel {{IPAc-en|\u00e6}}, which disappeared from the language and then reformed\n*\u00d0 \u00f0 ''[[edh]]''<!--OED spelling first--> or ''eth'' {{IPAc-en|'|\u025b|\u00f0}}, used for the consonants {{IPAc-en|\u00f0}} and {{IPAc-en|\u03b8}}\n*\u0152 \u0153 ''[[ethel (letter)|ethel]]'' {{IPAc-en|'|\u025b|\u00f0|\u0259l}}, used for the vowel {{IPAslink|\u0153}}, which disappeared from the language quite early\n*\u00de \u00fe ''[[thorn (letter)|thorn]]'' {{IPAc-en|'|\u03b8|\u0254r|n}}, used for the consonants {{IPAc-en|\u00f0}} and {{IPAc-en|\u03b8}}\n*\u01f7 \u01bf ''[[wyn (letter)|wyn]]''<!--OED spelling first--> or ''wynn'' {{IPAc-en|'|w|\u026a|n}}, used for the consonant {{IPAc-en|w}} (the letter 'w' had not yet been invented)\n*\u021c \u021d ''[[yogh]]'' {{IPAc-en|'|j|\u0252|g}} or  {{IPAc-en|'|j|\u0252|x}}, used for various sounds derived from {{IPAc-en|g}}, such as {{IPAc-en|j}} and {{IPAc-en|x}}.\n\n== Diacritics ==\n{{Main|English terms with diacritical marks}}\nThe most common diacritic marks seen in English publications are the acute (\u00e9), grave (\u00e8), circumflex (\u00e2, \u00ee or \u00f4), tilde (\u00f1), umlaut and diaeresis (\u00fc or \u00ef \u2013 the same symbol is used for two different purposes), and cedilla (\u00e7).<ref>{{Citation|last=Strizver|first=Ilene|title=Accents & Accented Characters|url=http://www.fonts.com/content/learning/fontology/level-3/signs-and-symbols/accents|work=Fontology|volume=|pages=|publisher=Monotype Imaging|access-date=2019-06-17}}</ref>\n\n=== Loanwords ===\n[[Diacritic]] marks mainly appear in loanwords such as ''na\u00efve'' and ''fa\u00e7ade''. Informal English writing tends to omit diacritics because of their absence from the keyboard, while professional copywriters and typesetters tend to include them.\n\nAs such words become naturalised in English, there is a tendency to drop the diacritics, as has happened with many older borrowings from French, such as ''h\u00f4tel''. Words that are still perceived as foreign tend to retain them; for example, the only spelling of ''soup\u00e7on'' found in English dictionaries (the [[Oxford English Dictionary|OED]] and others) uses the diacritic. However, diacritics are likely to be retained even in naturalised words where they would otherwise be confused with a common native English word (for example, ''r\u00e9sum\u00e9'' rather than ''resume'').<ref>{{Citation|author=Modern Humanities Research Association|first=|title=MHRA Style Guide: A Handbook for Authors and Editors|url=http://www.mhra.org.uk/style|volume=|pages=|year=2013|postscript=.|at=Section 2.2|edition=3rd|place=London|publisher=|format=pdf|access-date=2019-06-17|author-link=Modern Humanities Research Association|ISBN=978-1-78188-009-8}}</ref> Rarely, they may even added to a loanword for this reason (as in ''mat\u00e9'', from Spanish ''[[yerba mate]]'' but following the pattern of ''caf\u00e9'', from French, to distinguish from ''mate'').\n\n=== Native English words ===\nOccasionally, especially in older writing, diacritics are used to indicate the [[syllable]]s of a word: ''cursed'' (verb) is pronounced with one syllable, while ''curs\u00e8d'' ([[adjective]]) is pronounced with two. For this, ''\u00e8'' is used widely in poetry, e.g. in Shakespeare's sonnets. [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] uses ''\u00eb'', as in ''O wing\u00ebd crown''.\n\nSimilarly, while in ''chicken coop'' the letters ''-oo-'' represent a single vowel sound (a [[Digraph (orthography)|digraph]]), they less often represent two which may be marked with a diaresis as in ''zo\u00f6logist'' and ''co\u00f6peration''. This use of the [[Diaeresis (diacritic)|diaeresis]] is rare but found in some well-known publications, such as ''[[MIT Technology Review]]'' and ''[[The New Yorker]]''.\n\nIn general, these devices are not used even where they would serve to alleviate some degree of confusion.\n\n== Punctuation marks within words ==\n\n=== Apostrophe ===\nThe [[apostrophe]] (\u02bc) is not considered part of the English alphabet nor used as a diacritic even in loanwords. But it is used for two important purposes in written English: to mark the \"possessive\"<ref group=nb>Linguistic analyses vary on how best to characterise the English possessive morpheme ''-'s'': a noun case inflectional suffix distinct to ''possession'', a ''genitive case'' inflectional suffix equivalent to prepositional periphrastic ''of X'' (or rarely ''for X''), an ''edge inflection'' that uniquely attaches to a noun phrase's final (rather than ''head'') word, or an ''enclitic postposition''.</ref> and to mark [[Contraction (grammar)|contracted]] words. Current standards require its use for both purposes. Therefore, apostrophes are necessary to spell many words even in isolation, unlike most punctuation marks, which are concerned with indicating sentence structure and other relationships among multiple words.\n\n* It distinguishes (from the otherwise identical regular [[plural]] inflection ''-s'') the English [[possessive]] morpheme ''<nowiki/>'s'' (apostrophe alone after a regular plural affix, giving ''-s''' as the standard mark for plural + possessive). Practice settled in the 18th century; before then, practices varied but typically all three endings were written ''-s'' (but without cumulation). This meant that only regular nouns bearing neither could be confidently identified, and plural and possessive could be potentially confused (e.g., \"the Apostles words\"'';'' \"those things over there are my husbands\"<ref>[[Kingsley Amis]] quoted in Jane Fyne, \"[http://www.news.com.au/couriermail/story/0,23739,21619016-27197,00.html Little Things that Matter],\" [http://www.News.com.au ''Courier'' ''Mail''] (2007-04-26) Retrieved 2013-04-07.</ref>)\u2014which undermines the logic of \"[[Marker (linguistics)|marked]]\" forms.\n* Most common contractions have near-[[homographs]] from which they are distinguished in writing only by an apostrophe, for example ''it's'' (''it is'' or ''it has''), ''we're'' (we are), or ''she'd'' (''she would'' or ''she had'').\n\n=== Hyphen ===\n[[Hyphen]]s are often used in English [[Compound (linguistics)|compound words]]. Writing compound words may be hyphenated, open or closed, so specifics are guided by [[Style guide|stylistic policy]]. Some writers may use a [[Slash (punctuation)|slash]] in certain instances.\n\n== Frequencies ==\n{{Main|Letter frequency}}\nThe letter most commonly used in English is E. The least used letter is Z. The frequencies shown in the table may differ in practice according to the type of text.<ref>{{cite book|title=Cipher Systems:  The Protection of Communications|last1=Beker|first1=Henry|last2=Piper|first2=Fred|publisher=[[Wiley-Interscience]]|year=1982|page=397}} Table also available from\n{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CyCcRAm7eQMC&pg=PA36|title=Cryptological Mathematics|last=Lewand|first=Robert|publisher=[[Mathematical Association of America]]|year=2000|isbn=978-0883857199|page=36}} and {{cite web|url=http://pages.central.edu/emp/LintonT/classes/spring01/cryptography/letterfreq.html|title=Archived copy|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080708193159/http://pages.central.edu/emp/LintonT/classes/spring01/cryptography/letterfreq.html|archivedate=2008-07-08|url-status=dead|accessdate=2008-06-25}}</ref>\n\n== Phonology ==\n{{Main|English phonology}}\n\nThe letters A, E, I, O, and U are considered vowel letters, since (except when silent) they represent [[vowel]]s, although I and U represent consonants in words such as \"onion\" and \"quarter\" respectively.\n\nThe letter Y sometimes represents a consonant (as in \"young\") and sometimes a vowel (as in \"myth\"). Rarely, W may represent a vowel (as in \"cwm\")\u2014a [[Welsh language|Welsh]] influence. W and Y are sometimes referred to as [[semivowels|semi-vowels]] by linguists.\n\nThe remaining letters are considered consonant letters, since when not silent they generally represent [[consonant]]s.\n\n== History ==\n{{See also|History of the Latin alphabet|English orthography}}\n\n===Old English===\n{{main|Old English Latin alphabet}}\n\nThe [[English language]] itself was first written in the [[Anglo-Saxon runes|Anglo-Saxon futhorc]] runic alphabet, in use from the 5th century. This alphabet was brought to what is now England, along with the proto-form of the language itself, by [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] settlers. Very few examples of this form of written Old English have survived, mostly as short inscriptions or fragments.\n\nThe [[Latin script]], introduced by Christian missionaries, began to replace the Anglo-Saxon futhorc from about the 7th century, although the two continued in parallel for some time. As such, the Old English alphabet began to employ parts of the Roman alphabet in its construction.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Shaw|first=Phillip|date=May 2013|title=Adapting the Roman alphabet for Writing Old English: Evidence from Coin Epigraphy and Single-Sheet Characters|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com.suproxy.su.edu/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=5&sid=878bfad1-e737-49a9-93ea-7a34fb85e725%40pdc-v-sessmgr01|volume= 21|pages=115\u2013139|via=Ebscohost}}</ref> Futhorc influenced the emerging English alphabet by providing it with the letters ''[[thorn (letter)|thorn]]'' (\u00de \u00fe) and ''[[wynn]]'' (\u01f7 \u01bf). The letter ''[[eth]]'' (\u00d0 \u00f0) was later devised as a modification of ''[[d]]ee'' (D d), and finally ''[[yogh]]'' ({{lang|ang|\u021c}} {{lang|ang|\u021d}}) was created by Norman scribes from the [[insular G|insular ''g'']] in Old English and [[Irish language|Irish]], and used alongside their [[Carolingian g|Carolingian ''g'']].\n\nThe a-e [[Typographic ligature|ligature]] ''[[\u00e6|ash]]'' (\u00c6 \u00e6) was adopted as a letter in its own right, named after a futhorc rune ''[[Ansuz (rune)|\u00e6sc]]''. In very early Old English the o-e ligature ''[[\u0153|ethel]]'' (\u0152 \u0153) also appeared as a distinct letter, likewise named after a rune, ''[[odal (rune)|\u0153\u00f0el]]''{{citation_needed|date=March 2014}}. Additionally, the v-v or u-u ligature ''[[double-u]]'' (W w) was in use.\n\nIn the year 1011, a monk named [[Byrhtferth|Byrhtfer\u00f0]] recorded the traditional order of the Old English alphabet.<ref name=\"Evertype\">Michael Everson, Evertype, Baldur Sigur\u00f0sson, \u00cdslensk M\u00e1lst\u00f6\u00f0, ''[http://www.evertype.com/standards/wynnyogh/thorn.html On the Status of the Latin Letter \u00deorn and of its Sorting Order]''</ref> He listed the 24 letters of the Latin alphabet first (including [[ampersand]]), then 5 additional English letters, starting with the [[Tironian notes|Tironian note]] ''ond'' (<span style=\"font-family: segoe ui symbol, helvetica, dejavu sans, sans-serif\">\u204a</span>), an insular symbol for ''and'':\n\n:A B C D E F G H I K L M N O P Q R S T V X Y Z & <span style=\"font-family: segoe ui symbol, helvetica, dejavu sans, sans-serif\">\u204a</span> \u01f7 \u00de \u00d0 \u00c6\n\n===Modern English===\nIn the [[English orthography|orthography]] of [[Modern English]], [[Thorn (letter)|thorn]] (\u00fe), [[eth]] (\u00f0), [[wynn]] (\u01bf), [[yogh]] ({{lang|ang|\u021d}}), [[\u00e6|ash]] (\u00e6), and [[\u0153]] are obsolete. [[Latin]] borrowings reintroduced homographs of \u00e6 and \u0153 into [[Middle English]] and [[Early Modern English]], though they are largely obsolete (see \"Ligatures in recent usage\" below), and where they are used they are not considered to be separate letters (e.g. for collation purposes), but rather [[typographic ligature|ligatures]]. Thorn and eth were both replaced by ''[[th (digraph)|th]]'', though thorn continued in existence for some time, its lowercase form gradually becoming graphically indistinguishable from the [[Lower case|minuscule]] [[y]] in most handwriting. ''Y'' for ''th'' can still be seen in pseudo-archaisms such as \"[[Ye Olde]] Booke Shoppe\". The letters \u00fe and \u00f0 are still used in present-day [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], while \u00f0 is still used in present-day [[Faroese language|Faroese]]. Wynn disappeared from English around the 14th century when it was supplanted by ''uu'', which ultimately developed into the modern ''w''. Yogh disappeared around the 15th century and was typically replaced by ''gh''.\n\nThe letters ''[[u]]'' and ''[[j]]'', as distinct from ''[[v]]'' and ''[[i]]'', were introduced in the 16th century, and ''w'' assumed the status of an independent letter. The variant lowercase form [[long s]] (\u017f) lasted into [[Early Modern English|early modern English]], and was used in non-final position up to the early 19th century.

Some compound words (e.g., ''tee-shirt, deejay, emcee, okay,'' etc.), derived forms (e.g., ''exed out, effing, to eff and blind, aitchless'', etc.) and objects named after letters (e.g., ''em'' in printing and ''wye'' in railroading) may be written with the letter names. The spellings listed below are from the [[Oxford English Dictionary]]. Plurals of consonant names are formed by adding ''-s'' (e.g., ''bees, efs, ems'') or ''-es'' in the cases of ''aitch, ess'', and ''ex'' (i.e., ''aitches, esses, exes''). Plurals of vowel names add ''-es'' (i.e., ''aes, ees, ies, oes, ues''), but these are rare. Most commonly, the letter (generally in capitalized form) and not its name is used, in which case plural just adds ''-s''.\n\n<!-- Note: These are the *names of the letters*, according to the Oxford English Dictionary.

(See [[Latin alphabet#Origins|Latin alphabet: Origins]].)\n\nThe regular phonological developments (in rough chronological order) are:\n* palatalization before front vowels of Latin {{IPA|/k/}} successively to {{IPA|/t\u0283/}}, {{IPA|/ts/}}, and finally to Middle French {{IPA|/s/}}. Affects C.\n* palatalization before front vowels of Latin {{IPA|/\u0261/}} to Proto-Romance and Middle French {{IPA|/d\u0292/}}. Affects G.\n* fronting of Latin {{IPA|/u\u02d0/}} to Middle French {{IPA|/y\u02d0/}}, becoming Middle English {{IPA|/iw/}} and then Modern English {{IPA|/ju\u02d0/}}.

Affects A, B, C, D, E, G, H, I, K, O, P, T, and presumably Y.\n\nThe novel forms are ''aitch'', a regular development of Medieval Latin ''acca''; ''jay'', a new letter presumably vocalized like neighboring ''kay'' to avoid confusion with established ''gee'' (the other name, ''jy'', was taken from French); ''vee'', a new letter named by analogy with the majority; ''double-u'', a new letter, self-explanatory (the name of Latin V was ''\u016b''); ''wye'', of obscure origin but with an antecedent in Old French ''wi''; ''izzard'', from the Romance phrase ''i zed'' or ''i zeto'' \"and Z\" said when reciting the alphabet''; and zee'', an American levelling of ''zed'' by analogy with other consonants.\n\nSome groups of letters, such as ''pee'' and ''bee'', or ''em'' and ''en'', are easily confused in speech, especially when heard over the telephone or a radio communications link.  [[Spelling alphabet]]s such as the [[ICAO spelling alphabet]], used by [[aircraft]] pilots, police and others, are designed to eliminate this potential confusion by giving each letter a name that sounds quite different from any other.\n\n===Ampersand===\nThe [[ampersand]] (&) has sometimes appeared at the end of the English alphabet, as in Byrhtfer\u00f0's list of letters in 1011.<ref name=\"Evertype\" /> ''&'' was regarded as the 27th letter of the English alphabet, as taught to children in the US and elsewhere. An example may be seen in M. B. Moore's 1863 book ''The Dixie Primer, for the Little Folks''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://docsouth.unc.edu/imls/moore/moore.html#moore5|work=Branson, Farrar & Co., Raleigh NC|title=The Dixie Primer, for the Little Folks}}</ref> Historically, the figure is a [[Typographic ligature|ligature]] for the letters ''Et''.

Informal English writing tends to omit diacritics because of their absence from the keyboard, while professional copywriters and typesetters tend to include them.\n\nAs such words become naturalised in English, there is a tendency to drop the diacritics, as has happened with many older borrowings from French, such as ''h\u00f4tel''. Words that are still perceived as foreign tend to retain them; for example, the only spelling of ''soup\u00e7on'' found in English dictionaries (the [[Oxford English Dictionary|OED]] and others) uses the diacritic. However, diacritics are likely to be retained even in naturalised words where they would otherwise be confused with a common native English word (for example, ''r\u00e9sum\u00e9'' rather than ''resume'').<ref>{{Citation|author=Modern Humanities Research Association|first=|title=MHRA Style Guide: A Handbook for Authors and Editors|url=http://www.mhra.org.uk/style|volume=|pages=|year=2013|postscript=.|at=Section 2.2|edition=3rd|place=London|publisher=|format=pdf|access-date=2019-06-17|author-link=Modern Humanities Research Association|ISBN=978-1-78188-009-8}}</ref> Rarely, they may even added to a loanword for this reason (as in ''mat\u00e9'', from Spanish ''[[yerba mate]]'' but following the pattern of ''caf\u00e9'', from French, to distinguish from ''mate'').\n\n=== Native English words ===\nOccasionally, especially in older writing, diacritics are used to indicate the [[syllable]]s of a word: ''cursed'' (verb) is pronounced with one syllable, while ''curs\u00e8d'' ([[adjective]]) is pronounced with two. For this, ''\u00e8'' is used widely in poetry, e.g. in Shakespeare's sonnets. [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] uses ''\u00eb'', as in ''O wing\u00ebd crown''.\n\nSimilarly, while in ''chicken coop'' the letters ''-oo-'' represent a single vowel sound (a [[Digraph (orthography)|digraph]]), they less often represent two which may be marked with a diaresis as in ''zo\u00f6logist'' and ''co\u00f6peration''. This use of the [[Diaeresis (diacritic)|diaeresis]] is rare but found in some well-known publications, such as ''[[MIT Technology Review]]'' and ''[[The New Yorker]]''.\n\nIn general, these devices are not used even where they would serve to alleviate some degree of confusion.\n\n== Punctuation marks within words ==\n\n=== Apostrophe ===\nThe [[apostrophe]] (\u02bc) is not considered part of the English alphabet nor used as a diacritic even in loanwords. But it is used for two important purposes in written English: to mark the \"possessive\"<ref group=nb>Linguistic analyses vary on how best to characterise the English possessive morpheme ''-'s'': a noun case inflectional suffix distinct to ''possession'', a ''genitive case'' inflectional suffix equivalent to prepositional periphrastic ''of X'' (or rarely ''for X''), an ''edge inflection'' that uniquely attaches to a noun phrase's final (rather than ''head'') word, or an ''enclitic postposition''.</ref> and to mark [[Contraction (grammar)|contracted]] words. Current standards require its use for both purposes. Therefore, apostrophes are necessary to spell many words even in isolation, unlike most punctuation marks, which are concerned with indicating sentence structure and other relationships among multiple words.\n\n* It distinguishes (from the otherwise identical regular [[plural]] inflection ''-s'') the English [[possessive]] morpheme ''<nowiki/>'s'' (apostrophe alone after a regular plural affix, giving ''-s''' as the standard mark for plural + possessive). Practice settled in the 18th century; before then, practices varied but typically all three endings were written ''-s'' (but without cumulation). This meant that only regular nouns bearing neither could be confidently identified, and plural and possessive could be potentially confused (e.g., \"the Apostles words\"'';'' \"those things over there are my husbands\"<ref>[[Kingsley Amis]] quoted in Jane Fyne, \"[http://www.news.com.au/couriermail/story/0,23739,21619016-27197,00.html Little Things that Matter],\" [http://www.News.com.au ''Courier'' ''Mail''] (2007-04-26) Retrieved 2013-04-07.</ref>)\u2014which undermines the logic of \"[[Marker (linguistics)|marked]]\" forms.\n* Most common contractions have near-[[homographs]] from which they are distinguished in writing only by an apostrophe, for example ''it's'' (''it is'' or ''it has''), ''we're'' (we are), or ''she'd'' (''she would'' or ''she had'').\n\n=== Hyphen ===\n[[Hyphen]]s are often used in English [[Compound (linguistics)|compound words]]. Writing compound words may be hyphenated, open or closed, so specifics are guided by [[Style guide|stylistic policy]]. Some writers may use a [[Slash (punctuation)|slash]] in certain instances.\n\n== Frequencies ==\n{{Main|Letter frequency}}\nThe letter most commonly used in English is E. The least used letter is Z. The frequencies shown in the table may differ in practice according to the type of text.<ref>{{cite book|title=Cipher Systems:  The Protection of Communications|last1=Beker|first1=Henry|last2=Piper|first2=Fred|publisher=[[Wiley-Interscience]]|year=1982|page=397}} Table also available from\n{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CyCcRAm7eQMC&pg=PA36|title=Cryptological Mathematics|last=Lewand|first=Robert|publisher=[[Mathematical Association of America]]|year=2000|isbn=978-0883857199|page=36}} and {{cite web|url=http://pages.central.edu/emp/LintonT/classes/spring01/cryptography/letterfreq.html|title=Archived copy|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080708193159/http://pages.central.edu/emp/LintonT/classes/spring01/cryptography/letterfreq.html|archivedate=2008-07-08|url-status=dead|accessdate=2008-06-25}}</ref>\n\n== Phonology ==\n{{Main|English phonology}}\n\nThe letters A, E, I, O, and U are considered vowel letters, since (except when silent) they represent [[vowel]]s, although I and U represent consonants in words such as \"onion\" and \"quarter\" respectively.\n\nThe letter Y sometimes represents a consonant (as in \"young\") and sometimes a vowel (as in \"myth\"). Rarely, W may represent a vowel (as in \"cwm\")\u2014a [[Welsh language|Welsh]] influence. W and Y are sometimes referred to as [[semivowels|semi-vowels]] by linguists.\n\nThe remaining letters are considered consonant letters, since when not silent they generally represent [[consonant]]s.\n\n== History ==\n{{See also|History of the Latin alphabet|English orthography}}\n\n===Old English===\n{{main|Old English Latin alphabet}}\n\nThe [[English language]] itself was first written in the [[Anglo-Saxon runes|Anglo-Saxon futhorc]] runic alphabet, in use from the 5th century. This alphabet was brought to what is now England, along with the proto-form of the language itself, by [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] settlers. Very few examples of this form of written Old English have survived, mostly as short inscriptions or fragments.\n\nThe [[Latin script]], introduced by Christian missionaries, began to replace the Anglo-Saxon futhorc from about the 7th century, although the two continued in parallel for some time. As such, the Old English alphabet began to employ parts of the Roman alphabet in its construction.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Shaw|first=Phillip|date=May 2013|title=Adapting the Roman alphabet for Writing Old English: Evidence from Coin Epigraphy and Single-Sheet Characters|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com.suproxy.su.edu/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=5&sid=878bfad1-e737-49a9-93ea-7a34fb85e725%40pdc-v-sessmgr01|volume= 21|pages=115\u2013139|via=Ebscohost}}</ref> Futhorc influenced the emerging English alphabet by providing it with the letters ''[[thorn (letter)|thorn]]'' (\u00de \u00fe) and ''[[wynn]]'' (\u01f7 \u01bf). The letter ''[[eth]]'' (\u00d0 \u00f0) was later devised as a modification of ''[[d]]ee'' (D d), and finally ''[[yogh]]'' ({{lang|ang|\u021c}} {{lang|ang|\u021d}}) was created by Norman scribes from the [[insular G|insular ''g'']] in Old English and [[Irish language|Irish]], and used alongside their [[Carolingian g|Carolingian ''g'']].\n\nThe a-e [[Typographic ligature|ligature]] ''[[\u00e6|ash]]'' (\u00c6 \u00e6) was adopted as a letter in its own right, named after a futhorc rune ''[[Ansuz (rune)|\u00e6sc]]''. In very early Old English the o-e ligature ''[[\u0153|ethel]]'' (\u0152 \u0153) also appeared as a distinct letter, likewise named after a rune, ''[[odal (rune)|\u0153\u00f0el]]''{{citation_needed|date=March 2014}}. Additionally, the v-v or u-u ligature ''[[double-u]]'' (W w) was in use.\n\nIn the year 1011, a monk named [[Byrhtferth|Byrhtfer\u00f0]] recorded the traditional order of the Old English alphabet.<ref name=\"Evertype\">Michael Everson, Evertype, Baldur Sigur\u00f0sson, \u00cdslensk M\u00e1lst\u00f6\u00f0, ''[http://www.evertype.com/standards/wynnyogh/thorn.html On the Status of the Latin Letter \u00deorn and of its Sorting Order]''</ref> He listed the 24 letters of the Latin alphabet first (including [[ampersand]]), then 5 additional English letters, starting with the [[Tironian notes|Tironian note]] ''ond'' (<span style=\"font-family: segoe ui symbol, helvetica, dejavu sans, sans-serif\">\u204a</span>), an insular symbol for ''and'':\n\n:A B C D E F G H I K L M N O P Q R S T V X Y Z & <span style=\"font-family: segoe ui symbol, helvetica, dejavu sans, sans-serif\">\u204a</span> \u01f7 \u00de \u00d0 \u00c6\n\n===Modern English===\nIn the [[English orthography|orthography]] of [[Modern English]], [[Thorn (letter)|thorn]] (\u00fe), [[eth]] (\u00f0), [[wynn]] (\u01bf), [[yogh]] ({{lang|ang|\u021d}}), [[\u00e6|ash]] (\u00e6), and [[\u0153]] are obsolete. [[Latin]] borrowings reintroduced homographs of \u00e6 and \u0153 into [[Middle English]] and [[Early Modern English]], though they are largely obsolete (see \"Ligatures in recent usage\" below), and where they are used they are not considered to be separate letters (e.g. for collation purposes), but rather [[typographic ligature|ligatures]]. Thorn and eth were both replaced by ''[[th (digraph)|th]]'', though thorn continued in existence for some time, its lowercase form gradually becoming graphically indistinguishable from the [[Lower case|minuscule]] [[y]] in most handwriting. ''Y'' for ''th'' can still be seen in pseudo-archaisms such as \"[[Ye Olde]] Booke Shoppe\". The letters \u00fe and \u00f0 are still used in present-day [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], while \u00f0 is still used in present-day [[Faroese language|Faroese]]. Wynn disappeared from English around the 14th century when it was supplanted by ''uu'', which ultimately developed into the modern ''w''. Yogh disappeared around the 15th century and was typically replaced by ''gh''.\n\nThe letters ''[[u]]'' and ''[[j]]'', as distinct from ''[[v]]'' and ''[[i]]'', were introduced in the 16th century, and ''w'' assumed the status of an independent letter. The variant lowercase form [[long s]] (\u017f) lasted into [[Early Modern English|early modern English]], and was used in non-final position up to the early 19th century. Today, the English alphabet is considered to consist of the following 26 letters:\n\n{{flatlist | indent=1 |\n* {{Nowrap|[[A]] a}}\n* {{Nowrap|[[B]] b}}\n* {{Nowrap|[[C]] c}}\n* {{Nowrap|[[D]] d}}\n* {{Nowrap|[[E]] e}}\n* {{Nowrap|[[F]] f}}\n* {{Nowrap|[[G]] g}}\n* {{Nowrap|[[H]] h}}\n* {{Nowrap|[[I]] i}}\n* {{Nowrap|[[J]] j}}\n* {{Nowrap|[[K]] k}}\n* {{Nowrap|[[L]] l}}\n* {{Nowrap|[[M]] m}}\n* {{Nowrap|[[N]] n}}\n* {{Nowrap|[[O]] o}}\n* {{Nowrap|[[P]] p}}\n* {{Nowrap|[[Q]] q}}\n* {{Nowrap|[[R]] r}}\n* {{Nowrap|[[S]] s}}\n* {{Nowrap|[[T]] t}}\n* {{Nowrap|[[U]] u}}\n* {{Nowrap|[[V]] v}}\n* {{Nowrap|[[W]] w}}\n* {{Nowrap|[[X]] x}}\n* {{Nowrap|[[Y]] y}}\n* {{Nowrap|[[Z]] z}}\n}}\n\nWritten English has a number<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.phonicsontheweb.com/digraphs.php|title=Digraphs (Phonics on the Web)|website=phonicsontheweb.com|access-date=2016-04-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160413162011/http://www.phonicsontheweb.com/digraphs.php|archive-date=2016-04-13|url-status=dead}}</ref> of [[Digraph (orthography)|digraphs]], but they are not considered separate letters of the alphabet:\n\n{{flatlist | indent=1 |\n* ch\n* ci\n* ck\n* gh\n* ng\n* ph\n* qu\n* rh\n* sc\n* sh\n* th\n* ti\n* wh\n* wr\n* zh\n}}\n\n=== Ligatures in recent usage ===\nOutside of professional papers on specific subjects that traditionally use ligatures in [[loanword]]s, ligatures are seldom used in modern English.\nThe ligatures ''[[\u00e6]]'' and ''[[\u0153]]'' were until the 19th century (slightly later in American English){{citation needed|date=December 2014}} used in formal writing for certain words of Greek or Latin origin, such as ''[[encyclopedia|encyclop\u00e6dia]]'' and ''[[body cavity|c\u0153lom]]'', although such ligatures were not used in either classical Latin or ancient Greek. These are now usually rendered as \"ae\" and \"oe\" in all types of writing,{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} although in American English, a lone ''e'' has mostly supplanted both (for example, ''encyclopedia'' for ''encyclopaedia'', and ''maneuver'' for ''manoeuvre'').\n\nSome [[fonts]] for typesetting English contain commonly used ligatures, such as for {{angle bracket|tt}}, {{angle bracket|fi}}, {{angle bracket|fl}}, {{angle bracket|ffi}}, and {{angle bracket|ffl}}.

Due to these two factors, chair massage is often performed in settings such as business offices, employee appreciation events, trade shows, conferences, and other corporate settings.\n\n===Robotic===\n[[File:oto massage chair.JPG|thumb|upright|Robotic massage chair]]\nA robotic massage chair contains internal electronic motors and gears designed to massage the person sitting in them.

There are many different types and brands, including office-style chairs that operate from internal batteries.  A less expensive option is a separate massaging pad that may be used with an existing chair.\n\nThe benefits of a massage chair include deep relaxation, reduced blood pressure, a lowering of the pulse rate, and increased metabolism.\n\nMassage chairs are designed to mimic the hand motions of a massage therapist. They use a combination of massage rollers and airbags to massage the different parts of the body. \n\nRobotic massage chairs were first brought to market in 1954 by the Family Fujiryoki company. Today, Japan is the largest consumer of massage chairs with some surveys suggesting that over 20% of Japanese households actually own a massage chair.<ref>{{cite news|title=Notice |url=https://www.nippon.com/en/views/b02340/the-art-and-science-of-relaxation-japanese-massage-chair-maker-fujiiryoki.html |accessdate=10 Oct 2018 |work=www.nippon.com}}</ref>\n\nMassage chairs vary tremendously in price, style and intensity, from cheap \"vibrate only\" chairs to full intensity Shiatsu models.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T0m7l5MpoC4C|title=Chair massage|date=2011|publisher=Mosby Elsevier|year=|isbn=0323025595|edition=2nd|location=St. Louis, Mo.|page=52|pages=|last1=Anderson|first1=Patricia M.

The presence of glucose in the bloodstream triggers the production and release of insulin from the pancreas' beta islet cells. The main function of insulin is to increase the rate of transport of glucose from the bloodstream into certain cells of the body, such as [[Skeletal muscle|striated muscles]], [[fibroblast]]s, and [[fat cell]]s. It also is necessary for transport of [[amino acid]]s, [[glycogen]] formation in the liver and skeletal muscles, [[triglyceride]] formation from glucose, [[nucleic acid]] synthesis, and [[protein]] synthesis. In individuals with prediabetes, a failure of pancreatic hormone release, failure of targeted tissues to respond to the insulin present or both leads to blood glucose rises to abnormally high levels.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite book|title=Robbins Pathologic Basis of Disease|author1=Cotran|author2=Kumar|author3=Collins|date=1999|edition=Saunders Sixth|pages=913\u201326}}</ref>\n\n==Diagnosis==\nPrediabetes can be diagnosed with three different types of [[blood test]]<nowiki/>s<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=American Diabetes Association|date=2019|title=2.

It also is necessary for transport of [[amino acid]]s, [[glycogen]] formation in the liver and skeletal muscles, [[triglyceride]] formation from glucose, [[nucleic acid]] synthesis, and [[protein]] synthesis.
