publication of the Italian Army's order of battle by the Institute for Disarmament, Development and Peace (Istituto di ricerche per il disarmo, lo sviluppo e la pace (IRDISP) in [[Rome]] (a think thank of the [[Radical Party (Italy)|Radical Party]]). The published order of battle, down to company level, can be found at the Radical's Radio's website ([https://web.archive.org/web/20171201031533/http://www.radioradicale.it/exagora/lesercito-italiano-3-quello-che-i-russi-gia-sanno-e-gli-italiani-non-devono-sapere Link]). The structure was then adapted with information from the Italian Army's website and its units' histories listed there. Additionally the following website was used, which lists every Order of Battle for Italy's armies from 1553 to 1997, [http://xoomer.virgilio.it/ramius//Militaria/L'ESERCITO_DAL_1553_AL_1996.html Link].

He did not come out until after the police had detained the perpetrators. He hitchhiked home and started thinking about college. His next work was in retail, as a salesclerk in a [[department store]] men's underwear section, which he described as \"humiliating\". By this time, Grisham was halfway through college. Planning to become a tax lawyer, he was soon overcome by \"the complexity and lunacy\" of it.

She went on to earn degrees in chemistry from [[Missouri Southern State University|Missouri Southern State College]] (bachelor's, 1980), the [[Missouri University of Science and Technology]] (masters, 1982), and the [[University of Washington]] (doctorate, 1990).<ref name=\"encastro\">{{cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/astros/kavandi.htm|title=Encyclopedia Astronautica: Kavandi|date=February 1997|publisher=Mark Wade|accessdate=March 30, 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171122000000/http://www.astronautix.com/astros/kavandi.htm|archivedate=November 22, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\nFollowing graduation in 1982, Kavandi accepted a position at Eagle-Picher Industries in Joplin, Missouri, as an engineer in new battery development for defense applications. In 1984, she accepted a position as an engineer in the Power Systems Technology Department of [[Boeing Defense, Space & Security]] in Seattle, Washington. She served as the lead engineer of secondary power for the Short Range Attack Missile II, and principal technical staff representative involved in the design and development of thermal batteries for Sea Lance and the [[Lightweight Exo-Atmospheric Projectile]]. Other programs she supported include Space Station, Lunar and Mars Base studies, Inertial Upper Stage, Advanced Orbital Transfer Vehicle, Get-Away Specials, Air Launched Cruise Missile, Minuteman, and Peacekeeper. In 1986, while still working for Boeing, she was accepted into graduate school at the [[University of Washington]], where she began working toward her doctorate in analytical chemistry. Her doctoral dissertation involved the development of a pressure-indicating coating that uses oxygen quenching of porphyrin photoluminescence to provide continuous surface pressure maps of aerodynamic test models in wind tunnels. Her work on pressure indicating paints has resulted in two [[patent]]s.<ref name=\"encastro\"/>\n\n==NASA career==\n[[File:Kavandi.jpg|right|thumb]]\nKavandi was selected as an astronaut candidate by NASA in December 1994 and reported to the Johnson Space Center in March 1995. Following an initial year of training, she was assigned to the Payloads and Habitability Branch, where she supported payload integration for the International Space Station. Kavandi served as a mission specialist on STS-91 (June 2\u201312, 1998), the 9th and final Shuttle-Mir docking mission, concluding the joint U.S./Russian Phase 1 program. Following the mission, she worked as a CAPCOM (spacecraft communicator) in NASA's Mission Control Center. On her second mission, she served aboard STS-99 (February 11\u201322, 2000), the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission, which mapped more than 47 million miles of the Earth's land surface to provide data for a highly accurate three-dimensional topographical map.\n\nKavandi subsequently worked in the Robotics Branch, where she trained on both the shuttle and space station robotic manipulator systems. On her most recent mission, she served aboard STS-104/ISS Assembly Flight 7A (July 12\u201324, 2001) on the tenth mission to the International Space Station. The shuttle crew installed the joint airlock \"Quest\" and conducted joint operations with the [[Expedition 2]] crew. Kavandi had trained in the [[Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory]] for spacewalking, but she did not take a spacewalk during STS-104.\n\nFollowing her last mission, Kavandi again served as lead for the Payloads and Habitability Branch, then as the Branch Chief for the International Space Station (ISS). She was responsible for the training, operations, safety, and habitability of crews on board the ISS, as well as the hardware and software development and design reviews.

She went on to earn degrees in chemistry from [[Missouri Southern State University|Missouri Southern State College]] (bachelor's, 1980), the [[Missouri University of Science and Technology]] (masters, 1982), and the [[University of Washington]] (doctorate, 1990).<ref name=\"encastro\">{{cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/astros/kavandi.htm|title=Encyclopedia Astronautica: Kavandi|date=February 1997|publisher=Mark Wade|accessdate=March 30, 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171122000000/http://www.astronautix.com/astros/kavandi.htm|archivedate=November 22, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\nFollowing graduation in 1982, Kavandi accepted a position at Eagle-Picher Industries in Joplin, Missouri, as an engineer in new battery development for defense applications. In 1984, she accepted a position as an engineer in the Power Systems Technology Department of [[Boeing Defense, Space & Security]] in Seattle, Washington. She served as the lead engineer of secondary power for the Short Range Attack Missile II, and principal technical staff representative involved in the design and development of thermal batteries for Sea Lance and the [[Lightweight Exo-Atmospheric Projectile]]. Other programs she supported include Space Station, Lunar and Mars Base studies, Inertial Upper Stage, Advanced Orbital Transfer Vehicle, Get-Away Specials, Air Launched Cruise Missile, Minuteman, and Peacekeeper. In 1986, while still working for Boeing, she was accepted into graduate school at the [[University of Washington]], where she began working toward her doctorate in analytical chemistry. Her doctoral dissertation involved the development of a pressure-indicating coating that uses oxygen quenching of porphyrin photoluminescence to provide continuous surface pressure maps of aerodynamic test models in wind tunnels. Her work on pressure indicating paints has resulted in two [[patent]]s.<ref name=\"encastro\"/>\n\n==NASA career==\n[[File:Kavandi.jpg|right|thumb]]\nKavandi was selected as an astronaut candidate by NASA in December 1994 and reported to the Johnson Space Center in March 1995. Following an initial year of training, she was assigned to the Payloads and Habitability Branch, where she supported payload integration for the International Space Station. Kavandi served as a mission specialist on STS-91 (June 2\u201312, 1998), the 9th and final Shuttle-Mir docking mission, concluding the joint U.S./Russian Phase 1 program. Following the mission, she worked as a CAPCOM (spacecraft communicator) in NASA's Mission Control Center. On her second mission, she served aboard STS-99 (February 11\u201322, 2000), the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission, which mapped more than 47 million miles of the Earth's land surface to provide data for a highly accurate three-dimensional topographical map.\n\nKavandi subsequently worked in the Robotics Branch, where she trained on both the shuttle and space station robotic manipulator systems. On her most recent mission, she served aboard STS-104/ISS Assembly Flight 7A (July 12\u201324, 2001) on the tenth mission to the International Space Station. The shuttle crew installed the joint airlock \"Quest\" and conducted joint operations with the [[Expedition 2]] crew. Kavandi had trained in the [[Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory]] for spacewalking, but she did not take a spacewalk during STS-104.\n\nFollowing her last mission, Kavandi again served as lead for the Payloads and Habitability Branch, then as the Branch Chief for the International Space Station (ISS). She was responsible for the training, operations, safety, and habitability of crews onboard the ISS, as well as the hardware and software development and design reviews. She was also responsible for the scientific payloads that the ISS crews operate on-orbit and for coordination between international partners for visiting vehicles and associated operations. In 2005, Kavandi accepted a position as [[Chief of the Astronaut Office|Deputy Chief of the Astronaut Office]] and served in that position until February 2008. Following that assignment, she became Deputy Director, Flight Crew Operations, and then Director, Flight Crew Operations [[Johnson Space Center]].\n\nA three flight veteran, Kavandi has logged over 33 days in space, traveling over 13.1 million miles in 535 Earth orbits.\n\nIn March 2016, Kavandi succeeded Jim Free as the Center Director at the NASA [[Glenn Research Center]] in Cleveland, Ohio.\n\nIn September 2019, she retired from NASA and started at [[Sierra Nevada Corporation]].\n\n==Awards and honors==\n*[[National Honor Society]], 1977.\n*Valedictorian of Carthage Senior High School, 1977.\n*Presidential Scholarship from Missouri Southern State University, 1977.\n*Graduated [[Magna Cum Laude]] from Missouri Southern State University, 1980.\n*Certificates for Team Excellence and Performance Excellence from Boeing Missile Systems, 1991.\n*[[NASA Space Flight Medal]]s\n*[[NASA Exceptional Service Medal]]s, 2001 and 2002.\n*[[NASA Outstanding Leadership Medal]], 2006.\n*[[United States Astronaut Hall of Fame]], 2019.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/atoms/files/kavandi.pdf NASA biography] October 2019\n\n{{NASA Astronaut Group 15}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Kavandi, Janet Lynn}}\n[[Category:1959 births]]\n[[Category:American astronauts]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Missouri Southern State University alumni]]\n[[Category:Missouri University of Science and Technology alumni]]\n[[Category:NASA civilian astronauts]]\n[[Category:People from Carthage, Missouri]]\n[[Category:People from Springfield, Missouri]]\n[[Category:United States Astronaut Hall of Fame inductees]]\n[[Category:University of Washington alumni]]\n[[Category:Women astronauts]]\n[[Category:Space Shuttle program astronauts]]\n", "name_user": "Majavah", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eNASA career:clean up,typo(s) fixed: onboard \u2192 on board", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janet_L._Kavandi"}

It was born without any intention from us. Brother Abu Ubaida... created a military base to train the young men to fight against the vicious, arrogant, brutal, terrorizing Soviet empire... So this place was called 'The Base' ['Al-Qa'idah'], as in a training base, so this name grew and became. We aren't separated from this nation.

[[Mohammad Najibullah]]'s Communist Afghan government lasted for three more years, before it was overrun by elements of the ''mujahideen''.\n\n===Expanding operations===\nToward the end of the [[Red Army|Soviet military]] mission in Afghanistan, some foreign ''mujahideen'' wanted to expand their operations to include Islamist struggles in other parts of the world, such as Palestine and [[Kashmir]]. A number of overlapping and interrelated organizations were formed, to further those aspirations. One of these was the organization that would eventually be called al-Qaeda.\n\nResearch suggests that al-Qaeda was formed on August 11, 1988, when a meeting between leaders of [[Egyptian Islamic Jihad]], [[Abdullah Yusuf Azzam|Abdullah Azzam]], and bin Laden took place.

The [[Iraqi invasion of Kuwait]] in August 1990 had put the Kingdom and its ruling [[House of Saud]] at risk. The world's most valuable oil fields were within striking distance of Iraqi forces in Kuwait, and Saddam's call to pan-Arab/Islamism could potentially rally internal dissent.\n\nIn the face of a seemingly massive Iraqi military presence, Saudi Arabia's own forces were outnumbered. Bin Laden offered the services of his ''mujahideen'' to [[Fahd of Saudi Arabia|King Fahd]] to protect Saudi Arabia from the Iraqi army. The Saudi monarch refused bin Laden's offer, opting instead to allow US and allied forces to deploy troops into Saudi territory.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Jehl|first=Douglas|title=A Nation Challenged: Holy war lured Saudis as rulers looked away|work=The New York Times|date=December 27, 2001|pages=A1, B4|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/12/27/world/a-nation-challenged-saudi-arabia-holy-war-lured-saudis-as-rulers-looked-away.html|accessdate=September 5, 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe deployment angered bin Laden, as he believed the presence of foreign troops in the \"land of the two mosques\" ([[Mecca]] and [[Medina]]) profaned sacred soil. After speaking publicly against the Saudi government for harboring American troops, he was banished and forced to live in exile in Sudan.\n\n===Sudan===\nFrom around 1992 to 1996, al-Qaeda and bin Laden based themselves in Sudan at the invitation of Islamist theoretician [[Hassan al-Turabi]]. The move followed an Islamist coup d'\u00e9tat in Sudan, led by Colonel [[Omar al-Bashir]], who professed a commitment to reordering Muslim political values. During this time, bin Laden assisted the Sudanese government, bought or set up various business enterprises, and established training camps.\n\nA key turning point for bin Laden occurred in 1993 when Saudi Arabia gave support for the [[Oslo Accords]], which set a path for peace between Israel and [[Palestinians]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Riedel|2008|p=52}}.</ref> Due to bin Laden's continuous verbal assault on King Fahd of Saudi Arabia, Fahd sent an emissary to Sudan on March 5, 1994 demanding bin Laden's passport.

The Taliban also garnered support from graduates of Islamic schools, which are called ''madrassa''.

The US offered Taliban leader [[Mohammed Omar|Mullah Omar]] a chance to surrender bin Laden and his top associates. The first forces to be inserted into Afghanistan were paramilitary officers from the CIA's elite [[Special Activities Division]] (SAD).\n\nThe [[Taliban]] offered to turn over bin Laden to a [[neutral country]] for trial if the US would provide evidence of bin Laden's complicity in the attacks.

As a result of the US [[special forces]] and [[close air support|air support]] for the Northern Alliance ground forces, a number of Taliban and [[Derunta training camp|al-Qaeda training camps]] were destroyed, and much of the operating structure of al-Qaeda is believed to have been disrupted. After being driven from their key positions in the [[Tora Bora]] area of Afghanistan, many al-Qaeda fighters tried to regroup in the rugged [[Gardez]] region of the nation.\n\n[[File:Khalid Shaikh Mohammed after capture.jpg|left|thumb|upright|[[Khalid Sheikh Mohammed]] after his arrest in [[Rawalpindi]], Pakistan, in March 2003.]]\n\nBy early 2002, al-Qaeda had been dealt a serious blow to its operational capacity, and the Afghan invasion appeared to be a success.

A number of overlapping and interrelated organizations were formed, to further those aspirations. One of these was the organization that would eventually be called al-Qaeda.\n\nResearch suggests that al-Qaeda was formed on August 11, 1988, when a meeting between leaders of [[Egyptian Islamic Jihad]], [[Abdullah Yusuf Azzam|Abdullah Azzam]], and bin Laden took place.

The [[Iraqi invasion of Kuwait]] in August 1990 had put the Kingdom and its ruling [[House of Saud]] at risk. The world's most valuable oil fields were within striking distance of Iraqi forces in Kuwait, and Saddam's call to pan-Arab/Islamism could potentially rally internal dissent.\n\nIn the face of a seemingly massive Iraqi military presence, Saudi Arabia's own forces were outnumbered. Bin Laden offered the services of his ''mujahideen'' to [[Fahd of Saudi Arabia|King Fahd]] to protect Saudi Arabia from the Iraqi army. The Saudi monarch refused bin Laden's offer, opting instead to allow US and allied forces to deploy troops into Saudi territory.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Jehl|first=Douglas|title=A Nation Challenged: Holy war lured Saudis as rulers looked away|work=The New York Times|date=December 27, 2001|pages=A1, B4|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/12/27/world/a-nation-challenged-saudi-arabia-holy-war-lured-saudis-as-rulers-looked-away.html|accessdate=September 5, 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe deployment angered bin Laden, as he believed the presence of foreign troops in the \"land of the two mosques\" ([[Mecca]] and [[Medina]]) profaned sacred soil. After speaking publicly against the Saudi government for harboring American troops, he was banished and forced to live in exile in Sudan.\n\n===Sudan===\nFrom around 1992 to 1996, al-Qaeda and bin Laden based themselves in Sudan at the invitation of Islamist theoretician [[Hassan al-Turabi]]. The move followed an Islamist coup d'\u00e9tat in Sudan, led by Colonel [[Omar al-Bashir]], who professed a commitment to reordering Muslim political values. During this time, bin Laden assisted the Sudanese government, bought or set up various business enterprises, and established training camps.\n\nA key turning point for bin Laden occurred in 1993 when Saudi Arabia gave support for the [[Oslo Accords]], which set a path for peace between Israel and [[Palestinians]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Riedel|2008|p=52}}.</ref> Due to bin Laden's continuous verbal assault on King Fahd of Saudi Arabia, Fahd sent an emissary to Sudan on March 5, 1994 demanding bin Laden's passport.

The US offered Taliban leader [[Mohammed Omar|Mullah Omar]] a chance to surrender bin Laden and his top associates. The first forces to be inserted into Afghanistan were paramilitary officers from the CIA's elite [[Special Activities Division]] (SAD).\n\nThe [[Taliban]] offered to turn over bin Laden to a [[neutral country]] for trial if the US would provide evidence of bin Laden's complicity in the attacks.

As a result of the US [[special forces]] and [[close air support|air support]] for the Northern Alliance ground forces, a number of Taliban and [[Derunta training camp|al-Qaeda training camps]] were destroyed, and much of the operating structure of al-Qaeda is believed to have been disrupted. After being driven from their key positions in the [[Tora Bora]] area of Afghanistan, many al-Qaeda fighters tried to regroup in the rugged [[Gardez]] region of the nation.\n\n[[File:Khalid Shaikh Mohammed after capture.jpg|left|thumb|upright|[[Khalid Sheikh Mohammed]] after his arrest in [[Rawalpindi]], Pakistan, in March 2003.]]\n\nBy early 2002, al-Qaeda had been dealt a serious blow to its operational capacity, and the Afghan invasion appeared to be a success.
