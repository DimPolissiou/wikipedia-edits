These [[courtier]]s included the monarch or noble's [[camarilla]] and [[retinue]], [[royal household|household]], [[nobility]], those with [[court appointment]]s, [[bodyguard]], and may also include emissaries from other kingdoms or visitors to the court. [[Prince \u00e9tranger|Foreign prince]]s and foreign nobility in [[exile]] may also seek refuge at a court.\n\n[[Near Eastern]] and [[Eastern world|Eastern]] courts often included the [[harem]] and [[concubines]] as well as [[eunuchs]] who fulfilled a variety of functions. At times, the harem was walled off and separate from the rest of the residence of the monarch. In [[Asia]], concubines were often a more visible part of the court. Lower ranking [[servants]] and [[bodyguard|bodyguards]] were not properly called courtiers, though they might be included as part of the court or [[royal household]] in the broadest definition. Entertainers and others may have been counted as part of the court.\n\n==Patronage and courtly culture==\n[[File:The 'Court of Lahore'..jpg|thumb|The [[Sikh Empire|Sikh]] 'Court of Lahore'.]]\nA [[royal household]] is the highest-ranking example of [[patronage]]. A [[regent]] or [[viceroy]] may hold court during the minority or absence of the hereditary ruler, and even an elected [[head of state]] may develop a court-like entourage of unofficial, personally-chosen advisors and \"companions\". The French word ''compagnon'' and its English derivation \"companion\" literally connote a \"sharer of the bread\" at table, and a court is an extension of the great individual's household. Wherever members of the household and bureaucrats of the administration overlap in personnel, it is reasonable to speak of a \"court\", for example in [[History of Iran|Achaemenid Persia]], [[Ming China]], [[Sicily|Norman Sicily]], the [[Papacy]] before 1870 (see [[Papal Household]]), and the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]]. A group of individuals dependent on the patronage of a great man, classically in ancient Rome, forms part of the system of \"clientage\" that is discussed under [[vassal]].\n\n[[File:LordMacartneyEmbassyToChina1793.jpg|thumb|200px|The [[Macartney Embassy]]. Lord Macartney salutes the [[Qianlong Emperor]], but refuses to [[kowtow]].]]\n[[File:Gouden Koetsier 2011.jpg|thumb|200px|The Dutch court is known for old traditions.]]\nIndividual rulers differed greatly in tastes and interests, as well as in political skills and in constitutional situations. Accordingly, some founded elaborate courts based on new [[palace]]s, only to have their successors retreat to remote [[castle]]s or to practical administrative centers. Personal retreats might arise far away from official court centres.\n\n[[Etiquette]] and [[hierarchy]] flourish in highly structured court settings, and may leave conservative traces over generations. Most courts featured a strict [[order of precedence]], often involving [[royal and noble ranks]], [[orders of chivalry]], and [[nobility]]. Some courts even featured [[Court uniform and dress in the United Kingdom|court uniforms]]. One of the major markers of a court is [[ceremony]]. Most monarchal courts included ceremonies concerning the [[investiture]] or [[coronation]] of the [[monarch]] and [[audience (meeting)|audiences]] with the monarch. Some courts had ceremonies around the waking and the sleeping of the monarch, called a [[lev\u00e9e (ceremony)|lev\u00e9e]]. [[Orders of chivalry]] as honorific orders became an important part of court culture starting in the 15th century.<ref>{{cite web|last=Velde|first=Fran\u00e7ois Velde|title=Legitimacy and Orders of Knighthood|url=http://www.heraldica.org/topics/orders/legitim.htm#accepted|work=Heraldica|accessdate=25 February 2015|date=25 February 2004}}</ref> They were the right of the [[monarch]], as the [[fount of honour]], to create and grant.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history===\n\nThe earliest developed courts were probably in the [[Akkadian Empire]], in [[Ancient Egypt]], and in [[Asia]] in [[China]] during the [[Shang dynasty]], but we find evidence of courts as described in the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]]<ref>{{cite book|last1=Radner|first1=Karen|authorlink = Karen Radner |title=The Oxford Handbook of Cuneiform Culture|date=22 September 2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford, UK|isbn=978-0-19-955730-1|pages=358\u2013379}}<!--|accessdate=24 February 2015--></ref> and in [[Asia]] in the [[Zhou Dynasty]].<ref>ChinaKnowledge.de encyclopedia, {{cite web|url=http://www.chinaknowledge.de/History/Zhou/zhou-admin.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-12-07 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130531215622/http://www.chinaknowledge.de/History/Zhou/zhou-admin.html |archivedate=2013-05-31 }}.

The [[Han dynasty]], [[Jin dynasty (266\u2013420)|Western Jin dynasty]], and [[Tang dynasty]] occupied the large palace complex at [[Weiyang Palace]] located near [[Chang'an]], and the later [[Ming dynasty]] and [[Qing dynasty]] occupied the whole [[Forbidden City]] and other parts of [[Beijing]], the present capital city of [[China]]. By the [[Sui dynasty]], the functions of the imperial household and the imperial government were clearly divided.\n\nDuring the [[Heian period]], [[Emperor of Japan|Japanese emperors]] and [[Imperial House of Japan|their families]] developed an exquisitely refined court that played an important role in their culture.\n\n===Medieval and modern Europe===\nAfter the collapse of the [[Roman Empire]] in the West, a true court culture can be recognized in the entourage of the [[Ostrogoth]] [[Theodoric the Great]] and in the court of [[Charlemagne]]. In the Roman East, a brilliant court continued to surround the [[Byzantine emperors]].\n\nIn [[Western Europe]], consolidation of power of local magnates and of kings in fixed administrative centres from the mid-13th century led to the creation of a distinct court culture that was the centre of intellectual and artistic patronage rivaling the [[abbot]]s and [[bishop]]s, in addition to its role as the apex of a rudimentary political bureaucracy that rivaled the courts of counts and dukes. The dynamics of hierarchy welded the court cultures together. Many early courts in Western Europe were [[itinerant court|itinerant courts]] that traveled from place to place.\n\nLocal courts proliferated in the splintered polities of [[medieval Europe]] and remained in [[Early Modern Europe|early modern times]] in Germany and in Italy. Such courts became known for intrigue and [[power (sociology)|power politics]]; some also gained prominence as centres and collective patrons of [[art]] and [[culture]]. In medieval Spain ([[Crown of Castile|Castile]]), provincial courts were created. Minor noblemen and ''burguesie'' allied to create a system to oppose the monarchy on many policy issues.  They were called \"las Cortes de Castilla\". These courts are the root of the current Spanish [[congress]] and [[senate]].\n\nThe courts of the [[Duchy of Burgundy]] and the [[Kingdom of Portugal]] were particularly influential over the development of court culture and pageantry in Europe. The court of [[Philip the Good]] was considered one of the most splendid in Europe and would influence the development of court life later on for all of France and Europe.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Oosterwijk|first1=A Van|title=Staging the Court of Burgundy (Studies in Medieval and Early Renaissance Art History)|date=1 February 2013|publisher=Brepols Publishers|isbn=1905375824}}<!--|accessdate=24 February 2015--></ref> Later [[Ali\u00e9nor de Poitiers]] of the Burgundian court would write one of the seminal books on court etiquette  Les honneurs de la cour (Honors of the Court).\n\nCourt life would reach its apogee of culture, complexity and etiquette at the courts of [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]] under [[Louis XIV of France]] and the [[Hofburg]] under the [[Habsburgs]].\n\nAs [[Executive (government)|political executive]] functions generally moved to more [[democracy|democratic]] bases, noble courts have seen their function reduced once more to that of a noble household, concentrating on personal service to the household head, [[ceremony|ceremonial]] and perhaps some residual politico-advisory functions. If [[republic]]an zeal has banished an area's erstwhile ruling [[nobility]], courts may survive in [[exile]]. Traces of royal court practices remain in present-day institutions like privy councils and governmental cabinets.\n\n===Africa===\n{{main|Monarchy in Africa}}\n[[File:Luxor temple38.JPG|thumb|right|A [[colonnade]] in Pharaoh [[Amenhotep III]]'s royal court at [[Luxor]].]]\nA series of [[Pharaoh]]s ruled [[Ancient Egypt]] over the course of three millennia (circa 3150 BC to 31 BC), until it was conquered by the [[Roman Empire]]. In the same time period several kingdoms with their own royal courts flourished in the nearby [[Nubia]] region, with at least one of them, that of the so-called [[A-Group]] culture, apparently influencing the customs of Egypt itself. From the 6th to 19th centuries, Egypt was variously part of the [[Byzantine Empire]], Islamic Empire, [[Mamluk]] Sultanate, [[Ottoman Empire]] and [[British Empire]] with a distant monarch. The [[Sultanate of Egypt]] was a short lived protectorate of the [[United Kingdom]] from 1914 until 1922, when it became the [[Kingdom of Egypt]] and Sultan [[Fuad I of Egypt|Fuad I]] changed his title to King. After the [[Egyptian Revolution of 1952]] the monarchy was dissolved and Egypt became a republic.\n\nIn the [[Horn of Africa]], the [[Kingdom of Aksum]] and later the [[Zagwe Dynasty]], [[Ethiopian Empire]] (1270\u20131974), and [[Aussa Sultanate]] all had royal courts. Various [[Somali aristocratic and court titles|Somali Sultanates]] also existed, including the [[Adal Sultanate]] (led by the [[Walashma dynasty]] of the [[Ifat Sultanate]]), [[Sultanate of Mogadishu]], [[Ajuran Sultanate]], Warsangali Sultanate, [[Geledi Sultanate]], [[Majeerteen Sultanate]] and [[Sultanate of Hobyo]].\n\nThe kingship system has been an integral part of the more centralized African societies for millennia. This is especially true in the [[Sahelian kingdoms|West African sahel]], where royal courts have been in existence since at least the era of the 9th century [[Takrur]] and [[Ghana empire]]s. The ruler of the 13th century [[Mali empire]], [[Mansa Musa]], brought a large number of his courtiers with him on the Islamic [[Hajj]] pilgrimage to [[Mecca]]. Today, the courts of the [[Ashanti people|Ashanti]] [[Nana (title)|nana]]s in modern [[Ghana]], the [[Mand\u00e9 peoples|Mande]] members of the [[Soninke people#Social organization and politics|tunkalemmu]] caste  in Mali, the [[Bamum people|Bamum]] [[sultan]]s of [[Cameroon]], the [[Kanem Empire|Kanem]] [[shaykh]]s of [[Chad]], the [[Hausa people|Hausa]] [[emir]]s of northern [[Nigeria]], the [[inkosi]]s of the [[Southern African]] [[Zulu people|Zulus]] and [[Xhosa people|Xhosas]] and the [[Oba (ruler)|oba]]s and [[Oba (ruler)#Aristocratic titles among the Yoruba|baale]]s of [[Yorubaland]], amongst others, continue the pageantry and court lifestyle traditions once common to the continent.\n\n==Court structure and organization==\n===Court officials===\n[[File:Triboulet gravure de J.

With time, such duties often became archaic. However, titles survived involving the ghosts of arcane duties.

One of the criteria of Norbert Elias' concept of a court society is that it existed in space.{{clarifyme|date=November 2017}}{{sfn|Elias|1983}}{{pn|date=May 2019}} The [[German language|German]] word ''Hof'', meaning an enclosed [[courtyard]], can also apply to a rural farmstead with outbuildings and walls forming the perimeter. It has also been used for the [[Seat (legal entity)|palatial seat]] where the court was held. Thus ''Hof'' or \"court\" can become transferred to the building itself. For example, the grand residence [[Hampton Court Palace]] on the [[River Thames]] above London was where [[Thomas Wolsey]] held court as Catholic cardinal (built after the Italian ideal for a cardinal's palace) until his fall and its confiscation by Henry VIII. [[William III of England|William and Mary]] also held court there, 1689\u201394. Though it is built round two main courts, the structure itself is no longer the seat of a court in the sense of this article.\n\nAs an example, ambassadors to the United Kingdom are still accredited to the  [[Court of St. James's]], and courtiers of the monarchy may still have offices in [[St James's Palace]], London. The present monarch, however, holds court at [[Buckingham Palace]], where dignitaries are received.

Everything from [[Algeria]] to the [[Balkans]] to [[Yemen]] was controlled by the court in [[Istanbul]].\n\nThe royal courts in the [[Islamic world]] were mostly run by rulers, but there were the exceptions of important elite families such as [[Barmaids]] and [[Izanami]] who established their own minor courts, enabling them to encourage arts and improve the empire even if the ruling king was useless.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Ali\u00e9nor de Poitiers]], who documented the etiquette of the Burgundian Court in the late 15th century\n* [[Camarilla]]\n* [[Court appointment]]\n* [[Courtesy book]]\n* [[Courtier]]\n* [[Curia regis]]\n* [[Itinerant court]]\n* [[Masque]]\n* [[Royal Household]]\n* [[Striking in the King's Court]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{Cite book |ref=harv |author-link=Norbert Elias |last=Elias |first=Norbert |title=The Court Society |location=Oxford |year=1983 |others=trans.

Hence the word court may also be applied to the coterie of a senior member of the [[nobility]]. Royal courts may have their seat in a designated place, several specific places, or be a mobile, [[itinerant court]]. \n\nIn the largest courts, the [[Royal Household|royal households]], many thousands of individuals comprised the court. These [[courtier]]s included the monarch or noble's [[camarilla]] and [[retinue]], [[royal household|household]], [[nobility]], those with [[court appointment]]s, [[bodyguard]], and may also include emissaries from other kingdoms or visitors to the court. [[Prince \u00e9tranger|Foreign prince]]s and foreign nobility in [[exile]] may also seek refuge at a court.\n\n[[Near Eastern]] and [[Eastern world|Eastern]] courts often included the [[harem]] and [[concubines]] as well as [[eunuchs]] who fulfilled a variety of functions. At times, the harem was walled off and separate from the rest of the residence of the monarch. In [[Asia]], concubines were often a more visible part of the court. Lower ranking [[servants]] and [[bodyguard|bodyguards]] were not properly called courtiers, though they might be included as part of the court or [[royal household]] in the broadest definition. Entertainers and others may have been counted as part of the court.\n\n==Patronage and courtly culture==\n[[File:The 'Court of Lahore'..jpg|thumb|The [[Sikh Empire|Sikh]] 'Court of Lahore'.]]\nA [[royal household]] is the highest-ranking example of [[patronage]]. A [[regent]] or [[viceroy]] may hold court during the minority or absence of the hereditary ruler, and even an elected [[head of state]] may develop a court-like entourage of unofficial, personally-chosen advisors and \"companions\". The French word ''compagnon'' and its English derivation \"companion\" literally connote a \"sharer of the bread\" at table, and a court is an extension of the great individual's household. Wherever members of the household and bureaucrats of the administration overlap in personnel, it is reasonable to speak of a \"court\", for example in [[History of Iran|Achaemenid Persia]], [[Ming China]], [[Sicily|Norman Sicily]], the [[Papacy]] before 1870 (see [[Papal Household]]), and the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]]. A group of individuals dependent on the patronage of a great man, classically in ancient Rome, forms part of the system of \"clientage\" that is discussed under [[vassal]].\n\n[[File:LordMacartneyEmbassyToChina1793.jpg|thumb|200px|The [[Macartney Embassy]]. Lord Macartney salutes the [[Qianlong Emperor]], but refuses to [[kowtow]].]]\n[[File:Gouden Koetsier 2011.jpg|thumb|200px|The Dutch court is known for old traditions.]]\nIndividual rulers differed greatly in tastes and interests, as well as in political skills and in constitutional situations. Accordingly, some founded elaborate courts based on new [[palace]]s, only to have their successors retreat to remote [[castle]]s or to practical administrative centers. Personal retreats might arise far away from official court centres.\n\n[[Etiquette]] and [[hierarchy]] flourish in highly structured court settings, and may leave conservative traces over generations. Most courts featured a strict [[order of precedence]], often involving [[royal and noble ranks]], [[orders of chivalry]], and [[nobility]]. Some courts even featured [[Court uniform and dress in the United Kingdom|court uniforms]]. One of the major markers of a court is [[ceremony]]. Most monarchal courts included ceremonies concerning the [[investiture]] or [[coronation]] of the [[monarch]] and [[audience (meeting)|audiences]] with the monarch. Some courts had ceremonies around the waking and the sleeping of the monarch, called a [[lev\u00e9e (ceremony)|lev\u00e9e]]. [[Orders of chivalry]] as honorific orders became an important part of court culture starting in the 15th century.<ref>{{cite web|last=Velde|first=Fran\u00e7ois Velde|title=Legitimacy and Orders of Knighthood|url=http://www.heraldica.org/topics/orders/legitim.htm#accepted|work=Heraldica|accessdate=25 February 2015|date=25 February 2004}}</ref> They were the right of the [[monarch]], as the [[fount of honour]], to create and grant.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history===\n\nThe earliest developed courts were probably in the [[Akkadian Empire]], in [[Ancient Egypt]], and in [[Asia]] in [[China]] during the [[Shang dynasty]], but we find evidence of courts as described in the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]]<ref>{{cite book|last1=Radner|first1=Karen|authorlink = Karen Radner |title=The Oxford Handbook of Cuneiform Culture|date=22 September 2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford, UK|isbn=978-0-19-955730-1|pages=358\u2013379}}<!--|accessdate=24 February 2015--></ref> and in [[Asia]] in the [[Zhou Dynasty]].<ref>ChinaKnowledge.de encyclopedia, {{cite web|url=http://www.chinaknowledge.de/History/Zhou/zhou-admin.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-12-07 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130531215622/http://www.chinaknowledge.de/History/Zhou/zhou-admin.html |archivedate=2013-05-31 }}.

The [[Han dynasty]], [[Jin dynasty (266\u2013420)|Western Jin dynasty]], and [[Tang dynasty]] occupied the large palace complex at [[Weiyang Palace]] located near [[Chang'an]], and the later [[Ming dynasty]] and [[Qing dynasty]] occupied the whole [[Forbidden City]] and other parts of [[Beijing]], the present capital city of [[China]]. By the [[Sui dynasty]], the functions of the imperial household and the imperial government were clearly divided.\n\nDuring the [[Heian period]], [[Emperor of Japan|Japanese emperors]] and [[Imperial House of Japan|their families]] developed an exquisitely refined court that played an important role in their culture.\n\n===Medieval and modern Europe===\nAfter the collapse of the [[Roman Empire]] in the West, a true court culture can be recognized in the entourage of the [[Ostrogoth]] [[Theodoric the Great]] and in the court of [[Charlemagne]]. In the Roman East, a brilliant court continued to surround the [[Byzantine emperors]].\n\nIn [[Western Europe]], consolidation of power of local magnates and of kings in fixed administrative centres from the mid-13th century led to the creation of a distinct court culture that was the centre of intellectual and artistic patronage rivaling the [[abbot]]s and [[bishop]]s, in addition to its role as the apex of a rudimentary political bureaucracy that rivaled the courts of counts and dukes. The dynamics of hierarchy welded the court cultures together. Many early courts in Western Europe were [[itinerant court|itinerant courts]] that traveled from place to place.\n\nLocal courts proliferated in the splintered polities of [[medieval Europe]] and remained in [[Early Modern Europe|early modern times]] in Germany and in Italy. Such courts became known for intrigue and [[power (sociology)|power politics]]; some also gained prominence as centres and collective patrons of [[art]] and [[culture]]. In medieval Spain ([[Crown of Castile|Castile]]), provincial courts were created. Minor noblemen and ''burguesie'' allied to create a system to oppose the monarchy on many policy issues.  They were called \"las Cortes de Castilla\". These courts are the root of the current Spanish [[congress]] and [[senate]].\n\nThe courts of the [[Duchy of Burgundy]] and the [[Kingdom of Portugal]] were particularly influential over the development of court culture and pageantry in Europe. The court of [[Philip the Good]] was considered one of the most splendid in Europe and would influence the development of court life later on for all of France and Europe.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Oosterwijk|first1=A Van|title=Staging the Court of Burgundy (Studies in Medieval and Early Renaissance Art History)|date=1 February 2013|publisher=Brepols Publishers|isbn=1905375824}}<!--|accessdate=24 February 2015--></ref> Later [[Ali\u00e9nor de Poitiers]] of the Burgundian court would write one of the seminal books on court etiquette  Les honneurs de la cour (Honors of the Court).\n\nCourt life would reach its apogee of culture, complexity and etiquette at the courts of [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]] under [[Louis XIV of France]] and the [[Hofburg]] under the [[Habsburgs]].\n\nAs [[Executive (government)|political executive]] functions generally moved to more [[democracy|democratic]] bases, noble courts have seen their function reduced once more to that of a noble household, concentrating on personal service to the household head, [[ceremony|ceremonial]] and perhaps some residual politico-advisory functions. If [[republic]]an zeal has banished an area's erstwhile ruling [[nobility]], courts may survive in [[exile]]. Traces of royal court practices remain in present-day institutions like privy councils and governmental cabinets.\n\n===Africa===\n{{main|Monarchy in Africa}}\n[[File:Luxor temple38.JPG|thumb|right|A [[colonnade]] in Pharaoh [[Amenhotep III]]'s royal court at [[Luxor]].]]\nA series of [[Pharaoh]]s ruled [[Ancient Egypt]] over the course of three millennia (circa 3150 BC to 31 BC), until it was conquered by the [[Roman Empire]]. In the same time period several kingdoms with their own royal courts flourished in the nearby [[Nubia]] region, with at least one of them, that of the so-called [[A-Group]] culture, apparently influencing the customs of Egypt itself. From the 6th to 19th centuries, Egypt was variously part of the [[Byzantine Empire]], Islamic Empire, [[Mamluk]] Sultanate, [[Ottoman Empire]] and [[British Empire]] with a distant monarch. The [[Sultanate of Egypt]] was a short lived protectorate of the [[United Kingdom]] from 1914 until 1922, when it became the [[Kingdom of Egypt]] and Sultan [[Fuad I of Egypt|Fuad I]] changed his title to King. After the [[Egyptian Revolution of 1952]] the monarchy was dissolved and Egypt became a republic.\n\nIn the [[Horn of Africa]], the [[Kingdom of Aksum]] and later the [[Zagwe Dynasty]], [[Ethiopian Empire]] (1270\u20131974), and [[Aussa Sultanate]] all had royal courts. Various [[Somali aristocratic and court titles|Somali Sultanates]] also existed, including the [[Adal Sultanate]] (led by the [[Walashma dynasty]] of the [[Ifat Sultanate]]), [[Sultanate of Mogadishu]], [[Ajuran Sultanate]], Warsangali Sultanate, [[Geledi Sultanate]], [[Majeerteen Sultanate]] and [[Sultanate of Hobyo]].\n\nThe kingship system has been an integral part of the more centralized African societies for millennia. This is especially true in the [[Sahelian kingdoms|West African sahel]], where royal courts have been in existence since at least the era of the 9th century [[Takrur]] and [[Ghana empire]]s. The ruler of the 13th century [[Mali empire]], [[Mansa Musa]], brought a large number of his courtiers with him on the Islamic [[Hajj]] pilgrimage to [[Mecca]]. Today, the courts of the [[Ashanti people|Ashanti]] [[Nana (title)|nana]]s in modern [[Ghana]], the [[Mand\u00e9 peoples|Mande]] members of the [[Soninke people#Social organization and politics|tunkalemmu]] caste  in Mali, the [[Bamum people|Bamum]] [[sultan]]s of [[Cameroon]], the [[Kanem Empire|Kanem]] [[shaykh]]s of [[Chad]], the [[Hausa people|Hausa]] [[emir]]s of northern [[Nigeria]], the [[inkosi]]s of the [[Southern African]] [[Zulu people|Zulus]] and [[Xhosa people|Xhosas]] and the [[Oba (ruler)|oba]]s and [[Oba (ruler)#Aristocratic titles among the Yoruba|baale]]s of [[Yorubaland]], amongst others, continue the pageantry and court lifestyle traditions once common to the continent.\n\n==Court structure and organization==\n===Court officials===\n[[File:Triboulet gravure de J.

Beauc\u00e9 (1818\u20131875) and Georges Rouget (1781\u20131869).]]\nCourt officials or office-bearers (one type of [[courtier]]) derived their positions and retained their titles from their original duties within the courtly household. With time, such duties often became archaic. However, titles survived involving the ghosts of arcane duties. These styles generally dated back to the days when a noble household had practical and mundane concerns as well as high politics and culture. Such [[court appointment]]s each have their own histories. They might include but are not limited to:\n\n{{columns-list|colwidth=22em|\n* [[Almoner]]\n* [[Butler]]\n* [[Chamberlain (office)|Chamberlain]]\n* [[Chancellor]]\n* [[Chapelmaster]]\n* [[Chaplain]]\n* [[Cofferer]]\n* [[Confessor]]\n* [[Constable]]\n* [[Cup-bearer]]\n* [[Steward (office)|Dapifer]]\n* [[Doorward]]\n* [[Eunuch]]\n* [[Falconry|Falconer]]\n* [[Gentleman of the Bedchamber]]\n* [[Gentleman Usher]]\n* [[Grand Master (order)|Grandmaster]]\n* [[Great Officers of the Crown of France|Great officers]]\n* [[Groom of the Stool]]\n* [[Herald]]\n* [[Intendant]]\n* [[Jester|The Royal Fool]]\n* [[Keeper of the seal]]\n* [[King of arms]]\n* [[Knight]]/[[Earl Marshal]]\n* [[Lady-in-waiting]]\n* [[Maid of Honour]]\n* [[Majordomo (domestic staff)|Majordomo]]\n* [[Master of Ceremonies#Monarchies|Master of Ceremonies]]\n* [[Master of the Horse]]\n* [[Master of the Hunt (court appointment)|Master of the Hunt]]\n* [[Page (servant)|Page]]\n* [[Pantler of Scotland|Panter]] or [[Grand Panetier of France|Grand Panetier]]\n* [[Royal Secretary|Secretary]]\n* [[Pursuivant]]\n* [[Seneschal]]\n* [[Stolnik]]\n* [[Standard bearer]]\n* [[Steward (office)|Steward]]\n}}\n\n===Court seats===\nEarlier courts in medieval Western Europe were [[itinerant court]]s, but courts were often held in a fixed place. One of the criteria of Norbert Elias' concept of a court society is that it existed in space.{{clarifyme|date=November 2017}}{{sfn|Elias|1983}}{{pn|date=May 2019}} The [[German language|German]] word ''Hof'', meaning an enclosed [[courtyard]], can also apply to a rural farmstead with outbuildings and walls forming the perimeter. It has also been used for the [[Seat (legal entity)|palatial seat]] where the court was held. Thus ''Hof'' or \"court\" can become transferred to the building itself. For example, the grand residence [[Hampton Court Palace]] on the [[River Thames]] above London was where [[Thomas Wolsey]] held court as Catholic cardinal (built after the Italian ideal for a cardinal's palace) until his fall and its confiscation by Henry VIII. [[William III of England|William and Mary]] also held court there, 1689\u201394. Though it is built round two main courts, the structure itself is no longer the seat of a court in the sense of this article.\n\nAs an example, ambassadors to the United Kingdom are still accredited to the  [[Court of St. James's]], and courtiers of the monarchy may still have offices in [[St James's Palace]], London. The present monarch, however, holds court at [[Buckingham Palace]], where dignitaries are received.

This drew talented people from all walks of life\u2014such as [[musicians]], [[singers]], [[poets]] and [[scientists]]\u2014to seek employment under the patronage of elite [[bureaucrats]], [[emir]]s and [[Sultans]] at court. The other [[Caliphate]] was the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]], which employed its court's culture to stabilize an empire inhabited by huge non-Islamic populations spanning three [[continents]]. Everything from [[Algeria]] to the [[Balkans]] to [[Yemen]] was controlled by the court in [[Istanbul]].\n\nThe royal courts in the [[Islamic world]] were mostly run by rulers, but there were the exceptions of important elite families such as [[Barmaids]] and [[Izanami]] who established their own minor courts, enabling them to encourage arts and improve the empire even if the ruling king was useless.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Ali\u00e9nor de Poitiers]], who documented the etiquette of the Burgundian Court in the late 15th century\n* [[Camarilla]]\n* [[Court appointment]]\n* [[Courtesy book]]\n* [[Courtier]]\n* [[Curia regis]]\n* [[Itinerant court]]\n* [[Masque]]\n* [[Royal Household]]\n* [[Striking in the King's Court]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{Cite book |ref=harv |author-link=Norbert Elias |last=Elias |first=Norbert |title=The Court Society |location=Oxford |year=1983 |others=trans.

repeal of the Population Registration Act in 1991 removed any legal basis for specifying 'race'. The Identification Act of 1997 makes no mention of race. On the other hand, the Employment Equity Act speaks of 'designated groups' being 'black people, women and people with disabilities'. The Act defines 'black' as referring to 'Africans, coloureds and Indians'. Apartheid and the racial identification which underpinned it explicitly linked race with differential access to resources and power. If the post-apartheid order was committed to remedying this, race would have to be included in surveys and censuses, so that progress in eradicating the consequences of apartheid could be measured and monitored.

repeal of the Population Registration Act in 1991 removed any legal basis for specifying 'race'. The Identification Act of 1997 makes no mention of race. On the other hand, the Employment Equity Act speaks of 'designated groups' being 'black people, women and people with disabilities'. The Act defines 'black' as referring to 'Africans, coloureds and Indians'. Apartheid and the racial identification which underpinned it explicitly linked race with differential access to resources and power. If the post-apartheid order was committed to remedying this, race would have to be included in surveys and censuses, so that progress in eradicating the consequences of apartheid could be measured and monitored. This was the reasoning that led to a 'self-identifying' question about 'race' or 'population group' in both the 1996 and 2001 population censuses, and in Statistics SA's household survey programme.|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070814143522/http://www.statssa.gov.za/news_archive/05may2005_1.asp|archivedate=14 August 2007|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The [[South African National Census of 2011|2011 census]] figures for these groups were [[Bantu peoples in South Africa|Black African]] at 80.2%, [[White South Africans|White]] at 8.4%, [[Cape Coloureds|Coloured]] at 8.8%, [[Indian South Africans|Indian]]/[[Asian South Africans|Asian]] at 2.5%, and Other/Unspecified at 0.5%.<ref name=\"CIATONGA\">{{cite web|url= https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/sf.html|title= Africa :: SOUTH AFRICA|publisher= CIA The World Factbook}}</ref>\n\nThe white percentage of the population has sharply declined.

Downes chose a repertoire that ranged from traditional [[Celtic music|Celtic tunes]] to modern songs.\n\nThe show was meant to be a one-time event held in [[Dublin]], Ireland, but multiple airings on [[PBS]] helped boost the group's popularity.\n\nThe group's line-up has changed over the years.

([[Donna Summer]] placed the first two videos by an African American female artist, with \"[[She Works Hard for the Money]]\" and \"[[Unconditional Love (Donna Summer song)|Unconditional Love]]\", both in 1983.) Jackson's ''[[Thriller (Michael Jackson album)|Thriller]]'' (1982) is the [[List of best-selling albums|best-selling album of all time]], selling 25 million copies during the decade. His other album, 1987\u2019s ''[[Bad (album)|Bad]]'', has the honour of being the first album in history to have five number-one singles on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. Its accompanying world tour also made history by being the highest-grossing tour by a solo artist in the 1980s, as well as the highest-grossing at the time. In addition to being the biggest selling artist of the decade,  Jackson had nine number-one singles \u2013 more that any other act during the decade \u2013 and spent the longest time at number one (27 weeks) in the 1980s.

Madonna made music videos a marketing tool and was among the first to make them an artform. Many of her songs topped charts around the world, such as: \"[[Like a Virgin (song)|Like a Virgin]]\", \"[[Papa Don't Preach]]\", \"[[La Isla Bonita]]\" and \"[[Like a Prayer (song)|Like a Prayer]]\". After the [[Like a Prayer (album)|''Like a Prayer'' album]] in 1989, Madonna was named artist of the decade by a number of magazines and awards.  \"I thought the eighties was fabulous,\" she said, \"and I'm sure [[Boy George]] would agree with me.\"<ref>{{cite journal|first= Danny |last= Eccleston |title= Sexy Mother |magazine= [[Q (magazine)|Q]] |date= March 1998 |page= 90|url = http://imagem-madonna.blogspot.com/2018/02/sexy-mother-q-magazine-1998.html|via = Imagem-Madonna}}</ref>\n\n[[Whitney Houston]] was one of the best selling female artists of the decade in the US, behind [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] and [[Barbra Streisand]].

She also became the first and only artist to earn seven consecutive number-one songs on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100.\n\n[[Paula Abdul]] hit it big in 1988. With her debut album ''[[Forever Your Girl]]'', she was the first female to have four number one singles from a debut album (only [[The Jackson 5]] had done the same with their debut). She had five top ten hits from the album.\n\nBy 1980, the [[disco]] genre, largely dependent on [[orchestra]]s, was replaced by a lighter [[synthpop]] production, which subsequently fuelled dance music.\n\nIn the latter half of the 1980s sosossosso, [[teen pop]] experienced its first wave, with bands and artists including [[Expos\u00e9 (group)|Expos\u00e9]], [[Debbie Gibson]], [[Tiffany (American singer)|Tiffany]], [[New Edition]], [[Stacey Q]], [[The Bangles]], [[New Kids on the Block]], Madonna, George Michael, [[Laura Branigan]], [[Boy George]] and others becoming teen idols.\n\nProminent American [[urban pop]] acts of the 1980s include [[Tina Turner]], [[Lionel Richie]], Michael Jackson, Donna Summer, Whitney Houston and [[Diana Ross]]. African American artists like [[Lionel Richie]] and [[Prince (musician)|Prince]] became some of the decade's biggest stars. Their hit albums included ''[[1999 (Prince album)|1999]]'', ''[[Purple Rain (album)|Purple Rain]]'', and ''[[Sign \"O\" the Times]]'' by Prince and ''[[Lionel Richie (album)|Lionel Richie]]'', ''[[Can't Slow Down (Lionel Richie album)|Can't Slow Down]]'', and ''[[Dancing on the Ceiling]]'' by Richie.\n\nPrince was the decade's most prolific artist, not just by virtue of being the top charting artist in the US and worldwide. He was responsible for artists such as [[Vanity 6]], for whom he wrote the dance chart topping \"Nasty Girl\"; [[Morris Day]] and the Time, for whom he wrote the top 20 \"Jungle Love\"; [[Sheila E.]], for whom he wrote the top ten song \"[[The Glamorous Life]]\" and number 11 \"[[A Love Bizarre]]\"; and [[Wendy & Lisa]] and [[Apollonia 6]]. He wrote \"[[I Feel for You]]\" for [[Chaka Khan]], which won him a Grammy for best R&B song; \"[[Sugar Walls]]\" for [[Sheena Easton]]; and as well as doing a duet with \"[[U Got the Look|U Got The Look\"]], he wrote \"[[Manic Monday]]\", a number two pop hit for the Bangles. Artists that covered his music included [[Tom Jones (singer)|Tom Jones]], who brought his version of the song \"[[Kiss (Prince song)|Kiss]]\" into the top 40 for the second time in the decade. [[Melissa Morgan]] brought her cover of \"[[Do Me, Baby]]\" to the top of the R&B charts in 1986. Other notable artists that covered Prince during the 1980s were [[The Pointer Sisters]] and [[Cyndi Lauper]].<ref>https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/15-great-prince-songs-that-were-hits-for-other-artists-20160421.</ref> He also won an Academy Award for the song \"[[Purple Rain (song)|Purple Rain]]\". In 1989, Irish singer [[Sinead O'Connor]] would record a cover of his song \"[[Nothing Compares 2 U]]\", which would become the biggest song of the year worldwide in the new decade to follow. Prince had four number one singles and 14 top ten hits on the Hot 100 Chart.\n\nLionel Richie teamed with [[Diana Ross]] to record one of the decade's biggest hits [[Endless Love (song)|Endless Love]], which top the Billboard charts for nine weeks. Other songs by Richie, such as [[All Night Long (All Night)|All Night Long]] and [[Hello]] also top the charts, he would have a total of five number one hits, and 13 top ten singles. [[Diana Ross]] brought [[Upside Down (Diana Ross song)|Upside Down]] to the top spot in 1980, she would have two number one singles, and eight top ten hits in the decade. [[Tina Turner]] would top the charts with \"What's Love Got to Do With It\", she scored a total of six top ten singles. [[Donna Summer]]'s [[She Works Hard for the Money]] was a continuation of the feminist movement started in the 70s, and a rally cry for those who worked hard and wanted to be treated fairly. She would have five top ten singles in the decade.\n\n[[Bruce Springsteen]]'s ''Born In the USA'', [[AC/DC]]'s ''Back in Black'', [[Def Leppard]]'s ''Hysteria'', and [[Bon Jovi]]'s ''Slippery When Wet'' were some of the decade's biggest-selling albums on the Billboard Top 200 chart.\n\nDuring the mid-1980s American pop singer [[Cyndi Lauper]] was considered{{By whom|date=April 2020}} the \"Voice of the [[MTV]] Generation of '80s\" and so different visual style that made the world for teens. Her first two albums ''[[She's So Unusual]]'' (1984) and ''[[True Colors (Cyndi Lauper album)|True Colors]]'' (1986) were critically and commercially successful, spawning the hits, \"[[Girls Just Want to Have Fun]]\", \"[[Time After Time (Cyndi Lauper song)|Time After Time]]\", \"[[She Bop]]\", \"[[All Through the Night (Cyndi Lauper song)|All Through the Night]]\", \"[[The Goonies 'R' Good Enough]]\", \"[[True Colors (Cyndi Lauper song)|True Colors]]\" and \"[[Change of Heart (Cyndi Lauper song)|Change of Heart]]\".\n\nSeveral British artists made the successful transition to pop during the 1980s and saw great commercial success, such as [[David Bowie]], [[Phil Collins]], [[John Lennon]], [[Billy Ocean]], [[Sheena Easton]] and [[Paul McCartney]]. Many British pop bands also dominated the American charts in the early 1980s. Many of them became popular due to their constant exposure on [[MTV]], these bands included [[The Human League]], [[Culture Club]], [[Duran Duran]], and [[Wham!]]. Between the four, they have had 9 U.S. number ones with hits like \"[[Don't You Want Me]]\", \"[[Karma Chameleon]]\", \"[[The Reflex]]\" and \"[[Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go]]\" In the later part of the decade [[Rick Astley]], [[George Michael]] as a solo artist, [[Terence Trent D'Arby]], and [[Fine Young Cannibals]] all found chart success.\n\nAt the beginning of the 1980s, Australian artists like [[Olivia Newton-John]], [[Men at Work]], [[Air Supply]] and [[AC/DC]] all had chart success, later in the decade [[INXS]] scored hits. [[Olivia Newton-John]]'s hit [[Physical (Olivia Newton-John song)|Physical]] would top the Hot 100 for 10 weeks and be the decade's biggest hit in the US; she would have six top ten singles during the 80s.\n\nAmerican artists such as [[Michael Jackson]], [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], [[Bruce Springsteen]], [[Kool & the Gang]], [[The Pointer Sisters]], [[Billy Joel]], [[Hall & Oates]], [[Prince (musician)|Prince]], [[Kenny Rogers]] and [[John Mellencamp]], then known as John Cougar, ruled the charts throughout the decade in the US.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://rateyourmusic.com/list/abyss89/who-ruled-the-80s_the-200-biggest-artists-of-the-decade-in-the-usa/|title=Who ruled the 80's:The 200 biggest artists of the decade in the USA|website=RateYourMusic}}</ref> Prince, Madonna, Jackson, Joel and Springsteen along with [[U2]], [[Dire Straits]], [[Phil Collins]], [[The Police]], [[Queen (band)|Queen]], [[The Rolling Stones]] and [[Eurythmics]] achieved tremendous success worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://tsort.info/music/faq_decade_artists.htm|title = Who were the most successful artists of each decade?|website = Tsort|first = Steve|last = Harwin|date = 13 September 2019}}</ref>  \n{{Clear}}\n\n=== {{anchor|North American rock}} Rock ===\nIn the 1980s, rock music was more precisely defined and split up into multiple subgenres.\n\n==== Hard rock and heavy/glam metal ====\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2017}}\n[[Image:Metallica live London 2003-12-19 cropped.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Metallica]] in concert, 2003]]\nBeginning in 1983 and peaking in success in 1986-1990, the decade saw the resurgence of [[hard rock]] music and the emergence of its [[glam metal]] subgenre. Bands such as [[AC/DC]], [[Queen (band)|Queen]], [[Def Leppard]], [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]], [[M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce]], [[Bon Jovi]], [[Quiet Riot]], [[Scorpions (band)|Scorpions]], [[Europe (band)|Europe]], [[Ratt (band)|Ratt]], [[Twisted Sister]], [[Poison (American band)|Poison]], [[Dokken]], [[Whitesnake]], and [[Cinderella (band)|Cinderella]] were among the most popular acts of the decade. The 1980s saw the emergence of wildly popular hard rock band [[Guns N' Roses]] and the successful comebacks of [[Aerosmith]] and [[Alice Cooper]] in the late 1980s. The success of hard rock act [[Van Halen]] spanned throughout the entire decade, first with singer [[David Lee Roth]] and later with [[Sammy Hagar]]. Queen, which had expanded its music to experimental and crossover genres in the early 1980s, returned to guitar-driven hard rock with ''[[The Miracle (album)|The Miracle]]'' in 1989. Additionally, a few women managed to achieve stardom in the 1980s hard rock scene: [[Pat Benatar]] and Ann and Nancy Wilson of [[Heart (band)|Heart]], who had been around since the mid 1970s, are prime examples of female success in hard rock, and so are both ex-[[The Runaways|Runaways]] [[Joan Jett]] and [[Lita Ford]].\n\nThe [[arena rock]] trend of the 1970s continued in the 1980s with bands like [[Styx (band)|Styx]], [[Rush (band)|Rush]], [[Journey (band)|Journey]], [[Foreigner (band)|Foreigner]], [[REO Speedwagon]], [[ZZ Top]], and [[Aerosmith]].\n\nTraditionally associated (and often confused) with hard rock, heavy metal was also extremely popular throughout the decade, with [[Ozzy Osbourne]] achieving success during his solo career; bands like [[Iron Maiden]], [[Judas Priest]] and [[Dio (band)|Dio]] were also widely popular British acts. [[Speed metal]] pioneer [[Mot\u00f6rhead]] maintained its popularity through the releases of several albums.\n[[Underground music|Underground scenes]] produced an array of more extreme, aggressive Metal subgenres: [[thrash metal]] broke his arm into the mainstream with bands such as [[Metallica]], [[Slayer]], [[Exodus (American band)|Exodus]], [[Anthrax (American band)|Anthrax]], and [[Megadeth]]. By the late 1980s, [[Metallica]] would achieve mainstream success and would become one of the best selling music artists of all time. Other styles like [[death metal]] and [[black metal]] would remain a [[subculture|subcultural]] phenomena.\n\nThe decade also saw the emergence of a string of guitar virtuosi: [[Eddie Van Halen]], [[George Lynch (musician)|George Lynch]], [[Joe Satriani]], [[Steve Vai]], [[Randy Rhoads]], [[Jason Becker]] and [[Yngwie Malmsteen]] achieved international recognition for their skills. While considerably less numerous, [[bass guitar]] virtuosi also gained momentum in the 1980s: [[Geddy Lee]] (of [[Rush (band)|Rush]] [[Billy Sheehan]] (of [[David Lee Roth]] and [[Mr. Big (band)|Mr. Big]] fame), [[Cliff Burton]] (of [[Metallica]]) and alternative/funk metal bassist [[Les Claypool]] (of [[Primus (band)|Primus]] fame) became famous during that period. Iron Maiden founder and bassist [[Steve Harris (musician)|Steve Harris]] has also been praised numerous times for his galloping style of bass playing.\n\nBoth hard rock and heavy metal were extremely popular live genres and bands toured extensively around the globe.\n\n==== Alternative rock ====\n[[File:R.E.M., Belgium, 1985.jpg|thumb|right|230px|One of the first alternative rock bands, [[R.E.M.]] relied on [[campus radio|college radio]] airplay, constant touring, and a grassroots fanbase to break into the musical mainstream.]]\n\nBy 1984, a majority of groups signed to [[independent record labels]] were mining from a variety of rock and particularly 1960s rock influences. This represented a sharp break from the futuristic, hyper rational post-punk years.<ref>Reynolds, p. 392-93.</ref>\n\nThroughout the 1980s, alternative rock was mainly an underground phenomena. While on occasion a song would become a commercial hit or albums would receive critical praise in mainstream publications like ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', alternative rock in the 1980s was primarily relegated to [[independent record labels]], [[fanzines]] and [[college radio]] stations. Alternative bands built underground followings by touring constantly and regularly releasing low-budget albums. In the case of the United States, new bands would form in the wake of previous bands, which created an extensive underground circuit in America, filled with different scenes in various parts of the country.<ref name=\"American alt-rock\">Erlewine, Stephen Thomas. \"[{{Allmusic|class=explore|id=essay/|pure_url=yes}} American Alternative Rock/Post-Punk]\".

R.E.M. was the most immediately successful; its debut album, ''[[Murmur (album)|Murmur]]'' (1983), entered the Top 40 and spawned a number of [[jangle pop]] followers.<ref name=\"American alt-rock\"/> Alternative and [[indie pop]] movements sprang up in other parts of the world, from the [[Paisley Underground]] of Los Angeles ([[The Bangles]], [[Rain Parade]]) to Scotland ([[Aztec Camera]], [[Orange Juice (band)|Orange Juice]]), Australia ([[The Church (band)|The Church]], [[The Triffids]]), and New Zealand's [[Dunedin sound]] ([[The Clean]], [[The Chills]]).\n\nAmerican indie record labels [[SST Records]], [[Twin/Tone Records]], [[Touch and Go Records]], and [[Dischord Records]] presided over the shift from the [[hardcore punk]] that then dominated the American underground scene to the more diverse styles of alternative rock that were emerging.<ref>Reynolds, p. 390</ref> [[Music of Minnesota|Minnesota]] bands [[H\u00fcsker D\u00fc]] and [[The Replacements (band)|The Replacements]] were indicative of this shift. Both started out as punk rock bands, but soon diversified their sounds and became more melodic.<ref name=\"American alt-rock\"/>\n\nBy the late 1980s, the American alternative scene was dominated by styles ranging from quirky alternative pop ([[They Might Be Giants]] and [[Camper Van Beethoven]]), to [[noise rock]] ([[Big Black]], [[Swans (band)|Swans]]) to [[industrial rock]] ([[Ministry (band)|Ministry]], [[Nine Inch Nails]]) and to early [[Grunge]] ([[Mudhoney]], [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]]). These sounds were in turn followed by the advent of [[Boston (band)|Boston]]'s the [[Pixies (band)|Pixies]] and [[Los Angeles]]' [[Jane's Addiction]].<ref name=\"American alt-rock\"/>\n\nAmerican [[alternative rock]] bands of the 1980s included [[H\u00fcsker D\u00fc]], [[The Replacements (band)|The Replacements]], [[Minutemen (band)|Minutemen]], [[R.E.M.]], [[Dinosaur Jr.]], [[Pixies (band)|Pixies]], and [[Sonic Youth]] which were popular long before the [[Grunge]] movement of the early 1990s.\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1988-0719-38, Bruce Springsteen, Konzert in der DDR.jpg|150px|thumb|right|upright|[[Bruce Springsteen]], 1988]]\n[[File:Tracy Chapman 3.jpg|150px|thumb|left|upright|[[Tracy Chapman]], 2009]]\nNew singers and songwriters included [[Michael Jackson]], [[Bruce Springsteen]], [[Tom Petty]], [[Mark Heard]], [[Lucinda Williams]], [[Patti Smith]], [[Rickie Lee Jones]], [[Terence Trent D'Arby]], [[Stevie Nicks]], [[Suzanne Vega]], [[Cheryl Wheeler]] and [[Warren Zevon]]. Rock and even [[punk rock]] artists such as [[Peter Case]], [[Phil Collins]] and [[Paul Westerberg]] transitioned to careers as solo singers.\n\nIn the late 1980s, the term was applied to a group of predominantly female U.S. artists, beginning with [[Suzanne Vega]] whose first album sold unexpectedly well, followed by the likes of [[Tracy Chapman]], [[Nanci Griffith]], [[k.d. lang]] and [[Tori Amos]], who found success first in the United Kingdom, then in her home market.\n\n==== Other trends ====\nVarious older rock bands made a comeback. Bands originating from the early to mid-1960s such as [[The Beach Boys]] and [[The Kinks]] had hits with \"[[Kokomo (song)|Kokomo]]\", \"[[Come Dancing (song)|Come Dancing]]\" and \"Do It Again\". Bands with popularity in the mid-1970s such as the [[Steve Miller Band]] and [[Steely Dan]] also had hits with \"[[Abracadabra (Steve Miller Band song)|Abracadabra]]\" and \"[[Hey Nineteen]]\". Singer and songwriter [[Bruce Springsteen]] released his blockbuster album ''[[Born In The USA]]'', which produced a record-tying 7 hit singles. [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]] and [[George Thorogood]] sparked a revival of [[Atomic blues]] and [[Blues rock]]. Massively successful hard rock band [[Led Zeppelin]] disbanded after drummer [[John Bonham]]'s 1980 death, while contemporaries [[AC/DC]] continued to have success after the death of former frontman [[Bon Scott]]. [[Country rock]] saw a decline after [[Lynyrd Skynyrd]]'s 1977 plane crash and the 1980 disbanding of the genre's most successful band, [[Eagles (band)|the Eagles]]. [[The Grateful Dead]] had their biggest hit in band history with \"[[Touch of Grey]]\". [[The Who]] managed to provide the hit songs \"[[You Better You Bet]]\" and \"[[Eminence Front]]\" before burning out after the death of their drummer [[Keith Moon]].\n\n[[Hardcore punk]] flourished throughout the early to mid-1980s, with bands leading the genre such as [[Black Flag (band)|Black Flag]], [[Bad Brains]], [[Minor Threat]], [[Suicidal Tendencies]], [[D.O.A. (band)|D.O.A.]], and [[Dead Kennedys]] amongst others. It began to wane in the latter half of the decade, with the [[New York hardcore|New York hardcore scene]] dominating the genre. However, it experience a jumpstart in the late 1980s with emerging bands such as [[Operation Ivy (band)|Operation Ivy]] and [[Green Day]] that would define not just the so-called \"East Bay\" sound, but impact the next decade's punk and alternative sound. Some of which is still around today.\n\nThe 1980s proved a difficult time for many 1960s-70s veterans, many of them unable or unwilling to adapt to current trends. Music icons such as [[Bob Dylan]], [[Neil Young]], and [[The Rolling Stones]] released albums that were often poor quality and critically panned as they attempted to grapple with the changing times. MTV in particular was a problem for many artists, as it put a premium on youthfulness, good looks, and showmanship. Artists who became strongly associated with disco music also fell from grace and were often banned from radio play.\n\n=== Contemporary R&B ===\n{{See also|Contemporary R&B}}\nContemporary R&B originated in the 1980s, when musicians started adding [[disco]]-like beats, high-tech production, and elements of [[hip hop music|hip hop]], [[soul music|soul]] and [[funk]] to [[rhythm and blues]], making it more danceable and modern.<ref name=\"Rhythms and Rhymes\">{{Citation | last = Gazzah | first = Miriam | title = Rhythms and Rhymes of Life: music and Identification Processes of Dutch-Moroccan Youth | publisher = Amsterdam University Press | year = 2008 | page = 98 | isbn = 978-90-8964-062-8}}</ref> The top mainstream [[R&B]] artists of 1980s included [[Michael Jackson]], [[Prince (musician)|Prince]], [[Jermaine Jackson]], [[James Ingram]], [[The S.O.S.

Such music was originally born of and popularized via regional [[nightclub]] scenes in the 1980s, and became the predominant type of music played in [[discoth\u00e8ques]] as well as the [[rave]] scene.\n\n[[House music]] is a style of [[electronic dance music]] which originated in Chicago, Illinois, USA in the early 1980s.<ref name=\"Fikentscher\">{{citation|title=Youth\u2019s sonic forces: The club DJ: a brief history of a cultural icon|last=Fikentscher|first=Kai|journal=[[UNESCO Courier]]|publisher=[[UNESCO]]|date=July\u2013August 2000|page=45}}</ref> House music was strongly influenced by elements of [[soul music|soul]]- and [[funk]]-infused varieties of [[disco]]. Club play from pioneering DJs like [[Ron Hardy]] and [[Lil Louis]], local dance music record shops, and the popular Hot Mix 5 shows on radio station [[WVAZ|WBMX-FM]] helped popularize house music in Chicago and among visiting DJs & producers from [[Detroit]]. Trax Records and DJ International Records, local labels with wider distribution, helped popularize house music outside of Chicago. It eventually reached Europe before becoming infused in mainstream pop & dance music worldwide during the 1990s.\n\nIt has been widely cited that the initial blueprint for [[techno]] was developed during the mid-1980s in Detroit, [[Michigan]], by [[Juan Atkins]], [[Kevin Saunderson]], [[Derrick May (musician)|Derrick May]] (the so-called \"Belleville Three\"), and [[Eddie Fowlkes]], all of whom attended school together at [[Belleville High School (Belleville, Michigan)|Belleville High]], near Detroit.<ref>Brewster 2006:340\u2013359</ref><ref>Cosgrove 1988a.</ref><ref name=SICKO_UNKNOWN>Sicko 1999</ref><ref>Reynolds 1999:12\u201340</ref> Though initially conceived as party music that was played on daily mixed radio programs and played at parties given by cliquish, Detroit high school clubs, it has grown to be a global phenomenon.\n\n=== Country music ===\n[[Image:WIKI KENNY ROGERS.jpg|150px|thumb|right|[[Kenny Rogers]], bumholes\nominant style, through such acts as [[Kenny Rogers]], [[Ronnie Milsap]], [[T.G. Sheppard]], [[Eddie Rabbitt]], [[Crystal Gayle]], [[Anne Murray]] and [[Dolly Parton]]. The 1980 movie ''[[Urban Cowboy]]'', a romantic comedy starring [[John Travolta]] and [[Debra Winger]], spawned a successful soundtrack album featuring pop-styled country songs, including \"[[Lookin' for Love]]\" by [[Johnny Lee (singer)|Johnny Lee]], \"[[The Devil Went Down to Georgia]]\" by the [[Charlie Daniels Band]], \"[[Could I Have This Dance]]\" by Murray and \"[[Love the World Away]]\" by Rogers. The songs, and the movie itself, resulted in an early 1980s boom in pop-styled country music, and the era is sometimes known as the \"Urban Cowboy Movement\".\n\nBy the mid-1980s, country music audiences were beginning to tire of country pop. Although some pop-country artists continued to record and release successful songs and albums, the genre in general was beginning to suffer. By 1985, a ''New York Times'' article declared country music \"dead\". However, by this time, several newcomers were working behind the scenes to reverse this perception.\n\nThe year 1986 brought forth several new artists who performed in traditional country styles, such as honky-tonk. This sparked the \"new traditionalist\" movement, or return to traditional country music. The most successful of these artists included [[Randy Travis]], [[Dwight Yoakam]], [[Ricky Van Shelton]] and [[Holly Dunn]]. Also, artists like [[Kathy Mattea]] and [[Keith Whitley]], both of whom had been performing for a few years prior, had their first major hits during 1986; Mattea was more folk-styled, while Whitley was pure honky-tonk. But the new traditionalist movement had already taken hold as early as 1981, when newcomers such as [[Ricky Skaggs]] and [[George Strait]] had their first big hits. [[Reba McEntire]] had her first big hit in 1980 followed by 15 other number one hit singles during the decade. In addition, songwriter\u2013guitarist and [[Chet Atkins]] prodigy [[Steve Wariner]] also emerged as a popular act starting in the early 1980s. Another boom period for newcomers with new traditionalist styles was 1989, when artists such as [[Clint Black]], [[Garth Brooks]], [[Mary Chapin Carpenter]], [[Lorrie Morgan]] and [[Travis Tritt]] had their first big hits. It was Whitley who was seen as being one of the torchbearers of the new traditionalist movement, thanks to his pure honky-tonk style in the vein of Lefty Frizzell and others, and his star power was set to rise into the 1990s; however, Whitley was a known heavy drinker, and it was alcohol poisoning that ended his life in May 1989, just weeks after a song about triumph over personal demons -- \"[[I'm No Stranger to the Rain]]\"\u2014became a huge country hit. In keeping with the neotraditonalist movement, [[Dolly Parton]], [[Linda Ronstadt]] and [[Emmylou Harris]] teamed up to release 1987's Platinum selling ''[[Trio (Dolly Parton, Linda Ronstadt and Emmylou Harris album)|Trio]]'' album.  Composed mostly of traditional songs set to acoustic arrangements, the album won a Grammy in 1988 for best country collaboration.\n\nVocal duos were also popular because of their harmonies, most notably [[The Bellamy Brothers]] and [[The Judds]]. Several of the Bellamy Brothers' songs included double-entendre' laden [[hook (rhetoric)|hooks]], on songs such as \"Do You Love as Good As You Look\". The Judds, a mother-and-daughter duo, combined elements of contemporary pop and traditional country music on songs such as \"Why Not Me\" and \"[[Grandpa (Tell Me 'Bout the Good Ol' Days)]]\".\n\nCountry music groups and bands continued to rise in popularity during the 1980s. The most successful of the lot was [[Alabama (American band)|Alabama]], a [[Fort Payne, Alabama|Fort Payne]]-based band that blended traditional and pop country sounds with [[southern rock]]. Their concerts regularly sold out, while their single releases regularly reached No. 1 on the ''Billboard'' [[Hot Country Singles|Hot Country Songs]] chart. In 1989, Alabama was named the Artist of the Decade by the [[Academy of Country Music]]. By the end of the 1980s, the group had sold more than 24 million albums in the United States.\n\nRanking just behind Alabama in popularity, as far as groups were concerned, were [[The Oak Ridge Boys]] and [[The Statler Brothers]], both four-part harmony groups with gospel and country-pop stylings. The popularity of those three groups sparked a boom in new groups and bands, and by the end of the 1980s, fans were listening to such acts as [[Restless Heart]] and [[Exile (American band)|Exile]], the latter which previously enjoyed success with the pop hit \"[[Kiss You All Over]]\".\n\nDespite the prevailing pop country sound, enduring acts from the 1970s and earlier continued to enjoy great success with fans. [[George Jones]], one of the longest-running acts of the time, recorded several successful singles, including the critically acclaimed \"[[He Stopped Loving Her Today]]\". [[Conway Twitty]] continued to have a series of No. 1 hits, with 1986's \"Desperado Love\" becoming his 40th chart-topper on the ''Billboard'' Hot Country Singles chart, a record that stood for nearly 20 years. The movie ''[[Coal Miner's Daughter (film)|Coal Miner's Daughter]]'' profiled the life of [[Loretta Lynn]] (with [[Sissy Spacek]] in the lead role), while [[Willie Nelson]] also had a series of acting credits. [[Dolly Parton]] had much success in the 1980s, with several leading movie roles, two No. 1 albums and 13 number one hits, and having many successful tours; she also teamed up with [[Emmylou Harris]] and [[Linda Ronstadt]] in 1987 for the multi-plaitnum ''[[Trio (Dolly Parton, Linda Ronstadt and Emmylou Harris album)|Trio]]'' album. Others who had been around for a while and continued to have great success were [[Eddy Arnold]], [[Johnny Cash]], [[Merle Haggard]], [[Waylon Jennings]], [[Ray Price (musician)|Ray Price]], [[Hank Williams Jr.]] and [[Tammy Wynette]].\n\nIn addition to newcomer Whitley, top [[classic country]] and influential performers who died during the decade included [[Red Sovine]], [[Whitey Ford]], [[Marty Robbins]], [[Merle Travis]], [[Ernest Tubb]], [[Wynn Stewart]] and [[Tex Williams]]. Although not directly associated with country music, [[Roy Orbison]], a favorite of many country music fans and whose styles wound up being influential with many newcomers, died in 1988.\n\n== Europe ==\n{{See also|Music of the United Kingdom (1980s)||Neue Deutsche Welle}}\n\n=== {{anchor|European rock}} Rock ===\n\n==== Post-punk ====\n\nSome of the most successful [[post-punk]] bands at the beginning of the decade, such as [[Siouxsie and the Banshees]] and [[The Psychedelic Furs]], also continued their success during the 1980s.

Until the mid-80s the rock scene of most Spanish American countries were not connected, and it was rare for a rock band to gain acclaim and popularity outside its home country.\n\nArgentina, which had the largest national rock scene and music industry, became the birthplace of several influential rock acts. [[Soda Stereo]] from [[Buenos Aires]] is often acclaimed as the most influential rock band of the 80s alongside the solo careers of [[Charly Garc\u00eda]], [[Luis Alberto Spinetta]] and the new star [[Fito P\u00e1ez]] from [[Rosario]]. Soda Stereo was among the first bands to successfully tour across most of Latin America. Argentina developed also during the 80s a ska rock and punk rock scene. The punk movement, that was pioneered by [[Los Violadores]], led to the rise of the [[Buenos Aires Hardcore]] around 1990.\n\nIn Chile, that was ruled by a [[military dictatorship]] all over the 80s, [[Nueva canci\u00f3n]] protest songs from the 60s and 70s maintained their popularity despite severe censorship. The progressive/folk rock band [[Los Jaivas]] made a Latin American trademark album with [[Alturas de Macchu Picchu]] [sic] based on [[Pablo Neruda]]'s homonymous poem. The rock band [[Los Prisioneros]] were successful in combining the protest song atmosphere of the 80s with newer trends in rock including punk, ska, new wave and techno. In late 1980s new bands such as [[Los Tres]] and [[La Ley (band)|La Ley]] would start to set the trends for the next decade.\n\nIn Brazil, even though the 1960s witnessed the phenomenon of [[Jovem Guarda]] and the 1970s saw the appearance of many prolific artists, like [[Raul Seixas]], and bands like [[Os Mutantes]], [[Brazilian rock]]'s explosion began in 1981 with the first expressions of the ''Brazilian new wave'', later renamed the ''New Jovem Guarda'' by the media.\nThe alterations of the English new wave movement, with its surprising variety of styles, arrived in Brazil through groups and personalities such as [[Blitz (Brazilian band)|Blitz]], [[Camisa de V\u00eanus]], [[Bar\u00e3o Vermelho]], [[Kid Abelha]], [[Paralamas do Sucesso]], {{ill|Ritchie (musician)|lt=Ritchie|pt|Ritchie}}, [[Lulu Santos]], [[R\u00e1dio T\u00e1xi]], [[Marina Lima]], [[Engenheiros do Hawaii]], [[RPM (Brazilian band)|RPM]], Graffiti, [[Ultraje a Rigor]], [[Legi\u00e3o Urbana]], [[Ira!]], [[Tit\u00e3s]], [[Capital Inicial]], [[Nenhum de N\u00f3s]], [[Biquini Cavad\u00e3o]], [[Lob\u00e3o]] & Os Ronaldos, [[L\u00e9o Jaime]], and inumerous others.\nIn January 1985, the [[Rock in Rio]] festival took place in [[Rio de Janeiro]], which brought together over one million people to the [[City of Rock|Cidade do Rock]] during the 10 days of the event, and is to this day the country's biggest and most influential festival.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.voltosegunda.com/site/10-maiores-festivais-de-musica-do-mundo/|title=10 maiores festivais de m\u00fasica do mundo|website=Volto Segunda|language=pt|date=March 5, 2016|accessdate=February 13, 2017}}</ref> It represents a milestone in [[Freedom of speech|freedom of expression]], as in that same year the country saw the end of the [[Brazilian military government|dictatorship]],<ref name=\"pav\u00ea\">{{cite web|url=http://musicapave.com/artigos/rockologia-rock-in-rio-e-o-fim-da-ditadura-militar/|title=Rockologia: Rock in Rio e o fim da Ditadura Militar|last=Pinheiro|first=Matheus|website=M\u00fasica Pav\u00ea|language=pt|date=May 20, 2011|accessdate=February 13, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.sidneyrezende.com/noticia/112926|title=Rock in Rio: No dia que cai Ditadura, Bar\u00e3o Vermelho faz show hist\u00f3rico|website=Sidney Rezende|language=pt|date=December 11, 2010|accessdate=February 13, 2017}}</ref> and it is also responsible for establishing Brazil as a venue for international artists - as, so far, foreign attractions had been rarities.<ref name=\"pav\u00ea\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://super.abril.com.br/cultura/rock-in-rio-todo-mundo-junto/|title=Rock in Rio: Todo mundo junto!|website=[[Superinteressante]]|language=pt|date=October 31, 2004|accessdate=February 13, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn Mexico, the Rock music scene at the time first saw heavy lack of opportunity as musical acts could not make a solid living from playing alone. Other key factors were that of economic and political instability. Many consider this decade as the [[La D\u00e9cada Perdida|lost decade]]. The government would not allow racy themed content on television and on the airwaves, music festivals were not allowed. The music that dominated Mexico and much of Latin America during this era were mostly teen flavored acts like [[Menudo (band)|Menudo]], [[Timbiriche]], [[Flans]] and others. \n\nRock acts could not land any recording deal because record label executives were much more interested in selling listeners a colorful, hip and trendy image to the general public ranging from youngsters to middle aged adults. \n\nWith the strong impact of Argentine and [[La Movida Madrile\u00f1a|Spanish rock bands]] by the mid-1980s, the local scene would begin to develop acts that would generate an identity of its own. Among these were bands like [[El Tri]], [[Maldita Vecindad]], Los Amantes de Lola and [[Caifanes]].\n\n=== Salsa ===\nThe [[salsa music]] had developed in the 1960s and '70s by Puerto Rican and [[Cuba]]n immigrants to the [[New York City]] area but did not enter into mainstream popularity in Latin America until the late 1980s. The salsa music became together with [[cumbia]] the two most popular dance music but did not penetrate other countries outside the Caribbean as cumbia did.\n\nThe 1980s was a time of diversification, as popular salsa evolved into sweet and smooth [[salsa romantica]], with lyrics dwelling on love and romance, and its more explicit cousin, [[salsa erotica]]. Salsa romantica can be traced back to ''Noches Calientes'', a 1984 album by singer [[Jos\u00e9 Alberto]] with producer Louie Ramirez. A wave of romantica singers, found wide audience among Latinos in both New York and Puerto Rico.<ref>Manuel, ''Popular Music of the Non-Western World'', pg. 49</ref> The 1980s also saw salsa expand to Mexico, [[Argentina]], [[Peru]], Europe and Japan, and diversify into many new styles.\n\nIn the 1980s some performers experimented with combining elements of salsa with [[hip hop music]], while the producer and pianist [[Sergio George]] helped to revive salsa's commercial success. He created a sound based on prominent trombones and rootsy, mambo-inspired style. He worked with the [[Japanese salsa]] band [[Orquesta de la Luz]], and developed a studio orchestra that included [[Tito Nieves]], Celia Cruz, Jos\u00e9 Alberto, [[La India]], [[Tito Puente]] and [[Luis Enrique (singer)|Luis Enrique]]. The Colombian singer Joe Arroyo first rose to fame in the 1970s, but became a renowned exponent of [[Colombian salsa]] in the 1980s. Arroyo worked for many years with the Colombian arranger [[Fruko y sus Tesos|Fruko and his band Los Tesos]].<ref>Steward, pgs. 493\u2013497</ref>\n\n=== Merengue ===\n[[Merengue music]] would hit its golden years during the 1980s starting in the late 70s with acts such as [[Wilfrido Vargas]], [[Johnny Ventura]], and [[Fernando Villalona]]. Their orchestras would also churn future solo acts such as [[Eddy Herrera]] and [[Rubby Perez]]. By the end of the decade, La Coco Band would reinvent merengue with a more comedic style.\n\n== Australia and New Zealand ==\n{{Expand section|date=April 2010}}\n[[File:Hutchence-INXS.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Michael Hutchence]] singing during an [[INXS]] concert, early 1980s]]\nAustralian rock band [[INXS]] achieved international success during the decade with a series of hit recordings, including the albums ''[[Listen Like Thieves]]'' (1985), ''[[Kick (INXS album)|Kick]]'' (1987), and the singles \"[[Original Sin (INXS song)|Original Sin]]\" (1984), \"[[Need You Tonight]]\" (1987), \"[[Devil Inside (INXS song)|Devil Inside]]\" (1988) and \"[[New Sensation]]\" (1987).<ref name=\"Kent\">{{cite book |title=[[Kent Music Report|Australian Chart Book 1970&ndash;1992]] |last=Kent |first=David |authorlink= David Kent (historian)|publisher=Australian Chart Book|location=[[St Ives, New South Wales|St Ives]], Sydney |year=1993 |isbn=0-646-11917-6 }} Note: Used for Australian Singles and Albums charting until ARIA created their own charts in mid-1988.</ref><ref name=\"AusCharts\">{{cite web|url=http://australian-charts.com/showinterpret.asp?interpret=INXS |title=INXS discography |publisher=Australian Charts Portal |accessdate=2008-11-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140302214619/http://www.australian-charts.com/showinterpret.asp?interpret=INXS |archivedate=2014-03-02 }}</ref><ref name=AMGSingles>{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p4555/charts-awards/billboard-singles|pure_url=yes}} |title=INXS > Charts & Awards > Billboard singles|publisher=Allmusic|accessdate=2008-03-06}}</ref><ref name=BBalbums>{{cite web|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=inxs|chart=all}} |title=Artist Chart History - INXS - Albums|publisher=Billboard.com|accessdate=2008-03-06}}</ref>\n\n[[Kylie Minogue]] first single, \"[[The Loco-Motion|Locomotion]]\" became a huge hit in Minogue's native Australia, spending seven weeks at number one on the Australian singles chart. The single eventually became the highest selling Australian single of the decade. Throughout Europe and Asia the song also performed well on the music charts, reaching number one in [[Belgium]], [[Finland]], [[Ireland]], [[Israel]], [[Japan]], and [[South Africa]]. The Australian rock band [[Men at Work]] achieved success in 1981 with the single \"[[Down Under (song)|Down Under]]\" topping Australian charts for two consecutive weeks.\n\nIn 1980, [[New Zealand]] rock band [[Split Enz]] released their album ''[[True Colours (Split Enz album)|True Colours]]'', which became an international success.  Their single \"[[I Got You (Split Enz song)|I Got You]]\", which was praised for its \"Beatle-esque\" chorus, reached the top ten in [[New Zealand]], [[Australia]] and [[Canada]], reached number twelve in the [[United Kingdom]], and even charted the [[United States]]. [[Split Enz]] also received significant exposure in the [[United States]] upon the release of [[MTV]], which featured several [[Split Enz]] videos in the early days of its broadcast.  However, after several line-up changes, which included the departure of prominent member [[Tim Finn]], the band broke up in 1984 (another prominent [[New Zealand]]/[[Australian]] band, [[Mi-Sex]], known for its hit single \"[[Computer Games (song)|Computer Games]]\", disbanded the same year). [[Neil Finn]], the younger brother of [[Tim Finn]] who had become Split Enz's de facto frontman after his departure in 1983, went on to form [[Crowded House]] in [[New Zealand]] in 1985.  In 1986 [[Crowded House]] released their hugely successful self-titled debut album, which went to number one in [[Australia]] and number three in [[New Zealand]], as well as reaching the top ten in [[Canada]] and top twenty in the [[United States]].  It spawned the song \"[[Don't Dream It's Over]]\", which hit number one in [[New Zealand]] and [[Canada]], number two in the [[United States]] and number eight in [[Australia]], and has since become a pop/rock anthem in [[Australasia]].  Crowded House's follow up album ''[[Temple of Low Men]]'', released in 1988, did not achieve the same success as their debut, but was still popular in the band's homelands of [[New Zealand]] and [[Australia]]...\n\nBack at home, [[New Zealand]] continued to have a small and vibrant music scene, and the eighties saw the formation of many new bands, including [[The Swingers]], [[Coconut Rough]], [[The Crocodiles]] and Peking Man.  Many of these bands were short-lived and did not see much success outside of New Zealand and Australia.\n\n== Asia ==\n{{main|J-pop|Indian pop|C-pop|K-pop}}\n{{see also|Synthpop|Electro (music)|House music|Techno}}\n{{Expand section|date=September 2011}}\n\nIn [[Japan]], bands such as [[Shonen Knife]], [[Boredoms]], [[The Star Club]], [[X Japan]], [[Dead End (band)|Dead End]] and [[The Stalin]] began in the Japanese rock bands and [[Visual kei]] emerged in the 1980s with bands such as [[X Japan]], [[Buck Tick]] and [[D'erlanger]]. Japanese noise rock emerged in the 1980s with bands such as [[Melt-Banana]], [[Zeni Geva]] and [[Guitar Wolf]] in the Japanese's indies scene. \n\n[[City pop]], an adult-oriented genre with western influences of [[disco]], [[funk]], [[soft rock]], and [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] also became popular with the Japanese tech boom. Popular artists in the genre were [[Anri]] and [[Tatsuro Yamashita]]. Most songs were about love or living in the city. The genre was barely known outside of Japan. However, city pop has been getting increasingly popular in the west with Internet-born [[microgenre]] [[vaporwave]]. On May 3, 2019, [[Light in the Attic Records|Light in the Attic]], an independent record label, released Pacific Breeze: Japanese City Pop, AOR, and Boogie 1976-1986. It was a compilation album that showcased what city pop is and its style.\n\n[[Japanese hardcore]] emerged with bands such as [[The Star Club]] and [[GISM]] and [[Japanese idol]] group Onyanko Club began as Idol group in the teen fans and youth fans.\n\nIn addition,  Hong Kong saw a rapid growth in pop music, both in terms of variety and popularity. Big stars such as [[Leslie Cheung]], [[Anita Mui]], [[Danny Chan]], [[Alan Tam]] and [[Beyond (band)|Beyond]] were icons of the decade. The 1980s is still regarded as the most successful period in Hong Kong music history.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|1980s|Music}}\n*[[1970s in music]]\n*[[1990s in music]]\n*[[1960s in music]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*Hill, Dave (1986).

With her debut album ''[[Forever Your Girl]]'', she was the first female to have four number one singles from a debut album (only [[The Jackson 5]] had done the same with their debut). She had five top ten hits from the album.\n\nBy 1980, the [[disco]] genre, largely dependent on [[orchestra]]s, was replaced by a lighter [[synthpop]] production, which subsequently fuelled dance music.\n\nIn the latter half of the 1980s, [[teen pop]] experienced its first wave, with bands and artists including [[Expos\u00e9 (group)|Expos\u00e9]], [[Debbie Gibson]], [[Tiffany (American singer)|Tiffany]], [[New Edition]], [[Stacey Q]], [[The Bangles]], [[New Kids on the Block]], Madonna, George Michael, [[Laura Branigan]], [[Boy George]] and others becoming teen idols.\n\nProminent American [[urban pop]] acts of the 1980s include [[Tina Turner]], [[Lionel Richie]], Michael Jackson, Donna Summer, Whitney Houston and [[Diana Ross]].

[[Diana Ross]] brought [[Upside Down (Diana Ross song)|Upside Down]] to the top spot in 1980, she would have two number one singles, and eight top ten hits in the decade. [[Tina Turner]] would top the charts with \"What's Love Got to Do With It\", she scored a total of six top ten singles. [[Donna Summer]]'s [[She Works Hard for the Money]] was a continuation of the feminist movement started in the 70s, and a rally cry for those who worked hard and wanted to be treated fairly. She would have five top ten singles in the decade.\n\n[[Bruce Springsteen]]'s ''Born In the USA'', [[AC/DC]]'s ''Back in Black'', [[Def Leppard]]'s ''Hysteria'', and [[Bon Jovi]]'s ''Slippery When Wet'' were some of the decade's biggest-selling albums on the Billboard Top 200 chart.\n\nDuring the mid-1980s American pop singer [[Cyndi Lauper]] was considered{{By whom|date=April 2020}} the \"Voice of the [[MTV]] Generation of '80s\" and so different visual style that made the world for teens. Her first two albums ''[[She's So Unusual]]'' (1984) and ''[[True Colors (Cyndi Lauper album)|True Colors]]'' (1986) were critically and commercially successful, spawning the hits, \"[[Girls Just Want to Have Fun]]\", \"[[Time After Time (Cyndi Lauper song)|Time After Time]]\", \"[[She Bop]]\", \"[[All Through the Night (Cyndi Lauper song)|All Through the Night]]\", \"[[The Goonies 'R' Good Enough]]\", \"[[True Colors (Cyndi Lauper song)|True Colors]]\" and \"[[Change of Heart (Cyndi Lauper song)|Change of Heart]]\".\n\nSeveral British artists made the successful transition to pop during the 1980s and saw great commercial success, such as [[David Bowie]], [[Phil Collins]], [[John Lennon]], [[Billy Ocean]], [[Sheena Easton]] and [[Paul McCartney]]. Many British pop bands also dominated the American charts in the early 1980s. Many of them became popular due to their constant exposure on [[MTV]], these bands included [[The Human League]], [[Culture Club]], [[Duran Duran]], and [[Wham!]]. Between the four, they have had 9 U.S. number ones with hits like \"[[Don't You Want Me]]\", \"[[Karma Chameleon]]\", \"[[The Reflex]]\" and \"[[Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go]]\" In the later part of the decade [[Rick Astley]], [[George Michael]] as a solo artist, [[Terence Trent D'Arby]], and [[Fine Young Cannibals]] all found chart success.\n\nAt the beginning of the 1980s, Australian artists like [[Olivia Newton-John]], [[Men at Work]], [[Air Supply]] and [[AC/DC]] all had chart success, later in the decade [[INXS]] scored hits. [[Olivia Newton-John]]'s hit [[Physical (Olivia Newton-John song)|Physical]] would top the Hot 100 for 10 weeks and be the decade's biggest hit in the US; she would have six top ten singles during the 80s.\n\nAmerican artists such as [[Michael Jackson]], [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], [[Bruce Springsteen]], [[Kool & the Gang]], [[The Pointer Sisters]], [[Billy Joel]], [[Hall & Oates]], [[Prince (musician)|Prince]], [[Kenny Rogers]] and [[John Mellencamp]], then known as John Cougar, ruled the charts throughout the decade in the US.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://rateyourmusic.com/list/abyss89/who-ruled-the-80s_the-200-biggest-artists-of-the-decade-in-the-usa/|title=Who ruled the 80's:The 200 biggest artists of the decade in the USA|website=RateYourMusic}}</ref> Prince, Madonna, Jackson, Joel and Springsteen along with [[U2]], [[Dire Straits]], [[Phil Collins]], [[The Police]], [[Queen (band)|Queen]], [[The Rolling Stones]] and [[Eurythmics]] achieved tremendous success worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://tsort.info/music/faq_decade_artists.htm|title = Who were the most successful artists of each decade?|website = Tsort|first = Steve|last = Harwin|date = 13 September 2019}}</ref>  \n{{Clear}}\n\n=== {{anchor|North American rock}} Rock ===\nIn the 1980s, rock music was more precisely defined and split up into multiple subgenres.\n\n==== Hard rock and heavy/glam metal ====\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2017}}\n[[Image:Metallica live London 2003-12-19 cropped.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Metallica]] in concert, 2003]]\nBeginning in 1983 and peaking in success in 1986-1990, the decade saw the resurgence of [[hard rock]] music and the emergence of its [[glam metal]] subgenre.

Additionally, a few women managed to achieve stardom in the 1980s hard rock scene: [[Pat Benatar]] and Ann and Nancy Wilson of [[Heart (band)|Heart]], who had been around since the mid 1970s, are prime examples of female success in hard rock, and so are both ex-[[The Runaways|Runaways]] [[Joan Jett]] and [[Lita Ford]].\n\nThe [[arena rock]] trend of the 1970s continued in the 1980s with bands like [[Styx (band)|Styx]], [[Rush (band)|Rush]], [[Journey (band)|Journey]], [[Foreigner (band)|Foreigner]], [[REO Speedwagon]], [[ZZ Top]], and [[Aerosmith]].\n\nTraditionally associated (and often confused) with hard rock, heavy metal was also extremely popular throughout the decade, with [[Ozzy Osbourne]] achieving success during his solo career; bands like [[Iron Maiden]], [[Judas Priest]] and [[Dio (band)|Dio]] were also widely popular British acts. [[Speed metal]] pioneer [[Mot\u00f6rhead]] maintained its popularity through the releases of several albums.\n[[Underground music|Underground scenes]] produced an array of more extreme, aggressive Metal subgenres: [[thrash metal]] broke his arm into the mainstream with bands such as [[Metallica]], [[Slayer]], [[Exodus (American band)|Exodus]], [[Anthrax (American band)|Anthrax]], and [[Megadeth]]. By the late 1980s, [[Metallica]] would achieve mainstream success and would become one of the best selling music artists of all time. Other styles like [[death metal]] and [[black metal]] would remain a [[subculture|subcultural]] phenomena.\n\nThe decade also saw the emergence of a string of guitar virtuosi: [[Eddie Van Halen]], [[George Lynch (musician)|George Lynch]], [[Joe Satriani]], [[Steve Vai]], [[Randy Rhoads]], [[Jason Becker]] and [[Yngwie Malmsteen]] achieved international recognition for their skills. While considerably less numerous, [[bass guitar]] virtuosi also gained momentum in the 1980s: [[Geddy Lee]] (of [[Rush (band)|Rush]] [[Billy Sheehan]] (of [[David Lee Roth]] and [[Mr. Big (band)|Mr. Big]] fame), [[Cliff Burton]] (of [[Metallica]]) and alternative/funk metal bassist [[Les Claypool]] (of [[Primus (band)|Primus]] fame) became famous during that period. Iron Maiden founder and bassist [[Steve Harris (musician)|Steve Harris]] has also been praised numerous times for his galloping style of bass playing.\n\nBoth hard rock and heavy metal were extremely popular live genres and bands toured extensively around the globe.\n\n==== Alternative rock ====\n[[File:R.E.M., Belgium, 1985.jpg|thumb|right|230px|One of the first alternative rock bands, [[R.E.M.]] relied on [[campus radio|college radio]] airplay, constant touring, and a grassroots fanbase to break into the musical mainstream.]]\n\nBy 1984, a majority of groups signed to [[independent record labels]] were mining from a variety of rock and particularly 1960s rock influences. This represented a sharp break from the futuristic, hyper rational post-punk years.<ref>Reynolds, p. 392-93.</ref>\n\nThroughout the 1980s, alternative rock was mainly an underground phenomena. While on occasion a song would become a commercial hit or albums would receive critical praise in mainstream publications like ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', alternative rock in the 1980s was primarily relegated to [[independent record labels]], [[fanzines]] and [[college radio]] stations. Alternative bands built underground followings by touring constantly and regularly releasing low-budget albums. In the case of the United States, new bands would form in the wake of previous bands, which created an extensive underground circuit in America, filled with different scenes in various parts of the country.<ref name=\"American alt-rock\">Erlewine, Stephen Thomas. \"[{{Allmusic|class=explore|id=essay/|pure_url=yes}} American Alternative Rock/Post-Punk]\".

R.E.M. was the most immediately successful; its debut album, ''[[Murmur (album)|Murmur]]'' (1983), entered the Top 40 and spawned a number of [[jangle pop]] followers.<ref name=\"American alt-rock\"/> Alternative and [[indie pop]] movements sprang up in other parts of the world, from the [[Paisley Underground]] of Los Angeles ([[The Bangles]], [[Rain Parade]]) to Scotland ([[Aztec Camera]], [[Orange Juice (band)|Orange Juice]]), Australia ([[The Church (band)|The Church]], [[The Triffids]]), and New Zealand's [[Dunedin sound]] ([[The Clean]], [[The Chills]]).\n\nAmerican indie record labels [[SST Records]], [[Twin/Tone Records]], [[Touch and Go Records]], and [[Dischord Records]] presided over the shift from the [[hardcore punk]] that then dominated the American underground scene to the more diverse styles of alternative rock that were emerging.<ref>Reynolds, p. 390</ref> [[Music of Minnesota|Minnesota]] bands [[H\u00fcsker D\u00fc]] and [[The Replacements (band)|The Replacements]] were indicative of this shift. Both started out as punk rock bands, but soon diversified their sounds and became more melodic.<ref name=\"American alt-rock\"/>\n\nBy the late 1980s, the American alternative scene was dominated by styles ranging from quirky alternative pop ([[They Might Be Giants]] and [[Camper Van Beethoven]]), to [[noise rock]] ([[Big Black]], [[Swans (band)|Swans]]) to [[industrial rock]] ([[Ministry (band)|Ministry]], [[Nine Inch Nails]]) and to early [[Grunge]] ([[Mudhoney]], [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]]).

Rock and even [[punk rock]] artists such as [[Peter Case]], [[Phil Collins]] and [[Paul Westerberg]] transitioned to careers as solo singers.\n\nIn the late 1980s, the term was applied to a group of predominantly female U.S. artists, beginning with [[Suzanne Vega]] whose first album sold unexpectedly well, followed by the likes of [[Tracy Chapman]], [[Nanci Griffith]], [[k.d. lang]] and [[Tori Amos]], who found success first in the United Kingdom, then in her home market.\n\n==== Other trends ====\nVarious older rock bands made a comeback. Bands originating from the early to mid-1960s such as [[The Beach Boys]] and [[The Kinks]] had hits with \"[[Kokomo (song)|Kokomo]]\", \"[[Come Dancing (song)|Come Dancing]]\" and \"Do It Again\". Bands with popularity in the mid-1970s such as the [[Steve Miller Band]] and [[Steely Dan]] also had hits with \"[[Abracadabra (Steve Miller Band song)|Abracadabra]]\" and \"[[Hey Nineteen]]\". Singer and songwriter [[Bruce Springsteen]] released his blockbuster album ''[[Born In The USA]]'', which produced a record-tying 7 hit singles. [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]] and [[George Thorogood]] sparked a revival of [[Atomic blues]] and [[Blues rock]]. Massively successful hard rock band [[Led Zeppelin]] disbanded after drummer [[John Bonham]]'s 1980 death, while contemporaries [[AC/DC]] continued to have success after the death of former frontman [[Bon Scott]]. [[Country rock]] saw a decline after [[Lynyrd Skynyrd]]'s 1977 plane crash and the 1980 disbanding of the genre's most successful band, [[Eagles (band)|the Eagles]]. [[The Grateful Dead]] had their biggest hit in band history with \"[[Touch of Grey]]\". [[The Who]] managed to provide the hit songs \"[[You Better You Bet]]\" and \"[[Eminence Front]]\" before burning out after the death of their drummer [[Keith Moon]].\n\n[[Hardcore punk]] flourished throughout the early to mid-1980s, with bands leading the genre such as [[Black Flag (band)|Black Flag]], [[Bad Brains]], [[Minor Threat]], [[Suicidal Tendencies]], [[D.O.A. (band)|D.O.A.]], and [[Dead Kennedys]] amongst others. It began to wane in the latter half of the decade, with the [[New York hardcore|New York hardcore scene]] dominating the genre. However, it experience a jumpstart in the late 1980s with emerging bands such as [[Operation Ivy (band)|Operation Ivy]] and [[Green Day]] that would define not just the so-called \"East Bay\" sound, but impact the next decade's punk and alternative sound. Some of which is still around today.\n\nThe 1980s proved a difficult time for many 1960s-70s veterans, many of them unable or unwilling to adapt to current trends. Music icons such as [[Bob Dylan]], [[Neil Young]], and [[The Rolling Stones]] released albums that were often poor quality and critically panned as they attempted to grapple with the changing times. MTV in particular was a problem for many artists, as it put a premium on youthfulness, good looks, and showmanship. Artists who became strongly associated with disco music also fell from grace and were often banned from radio play.\n\n=== Contemporary R&B ===\n{{See also|Contemporary R&B}}\nContemporary R&B originated in the 1980s, when musicians started adding [[disco]]-like beats, high-tech production, and elements of [[hip hop music|hip hop]], [[soul music|soul]] and [[funk]] to [[rhythm and blues]], making it more danceable and modern.<ref name=\"Rhythms and Rhymes\">{{Citation | last = Gazzah | first = Miriam | title = Rhythms and Rhymes of Life: music and Identification Processes of Dutch-Moroccan Youth | publisher = Amsterdam University Press | year = 2008 | page = 98 | isbn = 978-90-8964-062-8}}</ref> The top mainstream [[R&B]] artists of 1980s included [[Michael Jackson]], [[Prince (musician)|Prince]], [[Jermaine Jackson]], [[James Ingram]], [[The S.O.S.

Such music was originally born of and popularized via regional [[nightclub]] scenes in the 1980s, and became the predominant type of music played in [[discoth\u00e8ques]] as well as the [[rave]] scene.\n\n[[House music]] is a style of [[electronic dance music]] which originated in Chicago, Illinois, USA in the early 1980s.<ref name=\"Fikentscher\">{{citation|title=Youth\u2019s sonic forces: The club DJ: a brief history of a cultural icon|last=Fikentscher|first=Kai|journal=[[UNESCO Courier]]|publisher=[[UNESCO]]|date=July\u2013August 2000|page=45}}</ref> House music was strongly influenced by elements of [[soul music|soul]]- and [[funk]]-infused varieties of [[disco]]. Club play from pioneering DJs like [[Ron Hardy]] and [[Lil Louis]], local dance music record shops, and the popular Hot Mix 5 shows on radio station [[WVAZ|WBMX-FM]] helped popularize house music in Chicago and among visiting DJs & producers from [[Detroit]]. Trax Records and DJ International Records, local labels with wider distribution, helped popularize house music outside of Chicago. It eventually reached Europe before becoming infused in mainstream pop & dance music worldwide during the 1990s.\n\nIt has been widely cited that the initial blueprint for [[techno]] was developed during the mid-1980s in Detroit, [[Michigan]], by [[Juan Atkins]], [[Kevin Saunderson]], [[Derrick May (musician)|Derrick May]] (the so-called \"Belleville Three\"), and [[Eddie Fowlkes]], all of whom attended school together at [[Belleville High School (Belleville, Michigan)|Belleville High]], near Detroit.<ref>Brewster 2006:340\u2013359</ref><ref>Cosgrove 1988a.</ref><ref name=SICKO_UNKNOWN>Sicko 1999</ref><ref>Reynolds 1999:12\u201340</ref> Though initially conceived as party music that was played on daily mixed radio programs and played at parties given by cliquish, Detroit high school clubs, it has grown to be a global phenomenon.\n\n=== Country music ===\n[[Image:WIKI KENNY ROGERS.jpg|150px|thumb|right|[[Kenny Rogers]], 2004]]\nAs the 1980s dawned, [[country pop|pop-influenced country music]] was the dominant style, through such acts as [[Kenny Rogers]], [[Ronnie Milsap]], [[T.G. Sheppard]], [[Eddie Rabbitt]], [[Crystal Gayle]], [[Anne Murray]] and [[Dolly Parton]]. The 1980 movie ''[[Urban Cowboy]]'', a romantic comedy starring [[John Travolta]] and [[Debra Winger]], spawned a successful soundtrack album featuring pop-styled country songs, including \"[[Lookin' for Love]]\" by [[Johnny Lee (singer)|Johnny Lee]], \"[[The Devil Went Down to Georgia]]\" by the [[Charlie Daniels Band]], \"[[Could I Have This Dance]]\" by Murray and \"[[Love the World Away]]\" by Rogers. The songs, and the movie itself, resulted in an early 1980s boom in pop-styled country music, and the era is sometimes known as the \"Urban Cowboy Movement\".\n\nBy the mid-1980s, country music audiences were beginning to tire of country pop. Although some pop-country artists continued to record and release successful songs and albums, the genre in general was beginning to suffer. By 1985, a ''New York Times'' article declared country music \"dead\". However, by this time, several newcomers were working behind the scenes to reverse this perception.\n\nThe year 1986 brought forth several new artists who performed in traditional country styles, such as honky-tonk. This sparked the \"new traditionalist\" movement, or return to traditional country music. The most successful of these artists included [[Randy Travis]], [[Dwight Yoakam]], [[Ricky Van Shelton]] and [[Holly Dunn]]. Also, artists like [[Kathy Mattea]] and [[Keith Whitley]], both of whom had been performing for a few years prior, had their first major hits during 1986; Mattea was more folk-styled, while Whitley was pure honky-tonk. But the new traditionalist movement had already taken hold as early as 1981, when newcomers such as [[Ricky Skaggs]] and [[George Strait]] had their first big hits. [[Reba McEntire]] had her first big hit in 1980 followed by 15 other number one hit singles during the decade. In addition, songwriter\u2013guitarist and [[Chet Atkins]] prodigy [[Steve Wariner]] also emerged as a popular act starting in the early 1980s. Another boom period for newcomers with new traditionalist styles was 1989, when artists such as [[Clint Black]], [[Garth Brooks]], [[Mary Chapin Carpenter]], [[Lorrie Morgan]] and [[Travis Tritt]] had their first big hits. It was Whitley who was seen as being one of the torchbearers of the new traditionalist movement, thanks to his pure honky-tonk style in the vein of Lefty Frizzell and others, and his star power was set to rise into the 1990s; however, Whitley was a known heavy drinker, and it was alcohol poisoning that ended his life in May 1989, just weeks after a song about triumph over personal demons -- \"[[I'm No Stranger to the Rain]]\"\u2014became a huge country hit. In keeping with the neotraditonalist movement, [[Dolly Parton]], [[Linda Ronstadt]] and [[Emmylou Harris]] teamed up to release 1987's Platinum selling ''[[Trio (Dolly Parton, Linda Ronstadt and Emmylou Harris album)|Trio]]'' album.  Composed mostly of traditional songs set to acoustic arrangements, the album won a Grammy in 1988 for best country collaboration.\n\nVocal duos were also popular because of their harmonies, most notably [[The Bellamy Brothers]] and [[The Judds]]. Several of the Bellamy Brothers' songs included double-entendre' laden [[hook (rhetoric)|hooks]], on songs such as \"Do You Love as Good As You Look\". The Judds, a mother-and-daughter duo, combined elements of contemporary pop and traditional country music on songs such as \"Why Not Me\" and \"[[Grandpa (Tell Me 'Bout the Good Ol' Days)]]\".\n\nCountry music groups and bands continued to rise in popularity during the 1980s. The most successful of the lot was [[Alabama (American band)|Alabama]], a [[Fort Payne, Alabama|Fort Payne]]-based band that blended traditional and pop country sounds with [[southern rock]]. Their concerts regularly sold out, while their single releases regularly reached No. 1 on the ''Billboard'' [[Hot Country Singles|Hot Country Songs]] chart. In 1989, Alabama was named the Artist of the Decade by the [[Academy of Country Music]]. By the end of the 1980s, the group had sold more than 24 million albums in the United States.\n\nRanking just behind Alabama in popularity, as far as groups were concerned, were [[The Oak Ridge Boys]] and [[The Statler Brothers]], both four-part harmony groups with gospel and country-pop stylings. The popularity of those three groups sparked a boom in new groups and bands, and by the end of the 1980s, fans were listening to such acts as [[Restless Heart]] and [[Exile (American band)|Exile]], the latter which previously enjoyed success with the pop hit \"[[Kiss You All Over]]\".\n\nDespite the prevailing pop country sound, enduring acts from the 1970s and earlier continued to enjoy great success with fans. [[George Jones]], one of the longest-running acts of the time, recorded several successful singles, including the critically acclaimed \"[[He Stopped Loving Her Today]]\". [[Conway Twitty]] continued to have a series of No. 1 hits, with 1986's \"Desperado Love\" becoming his 40th chart-topper on the ''Billboard'' Hot Country Singles chart, a record that stood for nearly 20 years. The movie ''[[Coal Miner's Daughter (film)|Coal Miner's Daughter]]'' profiled the life of [[Loretta Lynn]] (with [[Sissy Spacek]] in the lead role), while [[Willie Nelson]] also had a series of acting credits. [[Dolly Parton]] had much success in the 1980s, with several leading movie roles, two No. 1 albums and 13 number one hits, and having many successful tours; she also teamed up with [[Emmylou Harris]] and [[Linda Ronstadt]] in 1987 for the multi-plaitnum ''[[Trio (Dolly Parton, Linda Ronstadt and Emmylou Harris album)|Trio]]'' album. Others who had been around for a while and continued to have great success were [[Eddy Arnold]], [[Johnny Cash]], [[Merle Haggard]], [[Waylon Jennings]], [[Ray Price (musician)|Ray Price]], [[Hank Williams Jr.]] and [[Tammy Wynette]].\n\nIn addition to newcomer Whitley, top [[classic country]] and influential performers who died during the decade included [[Red Sovine]], [[Whitey Ford]], [[Marty Robbins]], [[Merle Travis]], [[Ernest Tubb]], [[Wynn Stewart]] and [[Tex Williams]]. Although not directly associated with country music, [[Roy Orbison]], a favorite of many country music fans and whose styles wound up being influential with many newcomers, died in 1988.\n\n== Europe ==\n{{See also|Music of the United Kingdom (1980s)||Neue Deutsche Welle}}\n\n=== {{anchor|European rock}} Rock ===\n\n==== Post-punk ====\n\nSome of the most successful [[post-punk]] bands at the beginning of the decade, such as [[Siouxsie and the Banshees]] and [[The Psychedelic Furs]], also continued their success during the 1980s.

Ireland's [[U2]] incorporated elements of religious imagery together with political commentary into their often anthemic music, and by the late 1980s had become one of the biggest bands in the world.<ref>F.

Argentine-Venezuelan singer [[Ricardo Montaner]] joins those veterans with his 1988 hit ''Tan Enamorado''. After the slow decline of [[Fania All-Stars]], the new romantic genre of ''salsa romantica'' would rise beginning in 1984.

[[Tejano Music]] starts to give little rise after [[Mazz]] crosses over to Mexico after their albums [[Una Noche Juntos]] and No Te Olvidare win Grammys.\n\nIn 1989, [[Juan Luis Guerra]] scores a major [[Merengue music|Merengue]] hit with ''Ojala que llueva cafe''.\n\n=== {{anchor|Latin American rock}} Rock ===\nThe [[Rock en Espa\u00f1ol]] movement began around the 1980s. Until the mid-80s the rock scene of most Spanish American countries were not connected, and it was rare for a rock band to gain acclaim and popularity outside its home country.\n\nArgentina, which had the largest national rock scene and music industry, became the birthplace of several influential rock acts. [[Soda Stereo]] from [[Buenos Aires]] is often acclaimed as the most influential rock band of the 80s alongside the solo careers of [[Charly Garc\u00eda]], [[Luis Alberto Spinetta]] and the new star [[Fito P\u00e1ez]] from [[Rosario]]. Soda Stereo was among the first bands to successfully tour across most of Latin America. Argentina developed also during the 80s a ska rock and punk rock scene. The punk movement, that was pioneered by [[Los Violadores]], led to the rise of the [[Buenos Aires Hardcore]] around 1990.\n\nIn Chile, that was ruled by a [[military dictatorship]] all over the 80s, [[Nueva canci\u00f3n]] protest songs from the 60s and 70s maintained their popularity despite severe censorship. The progressive/folk rock band [[Los Jaivas]] made a Latin American trademark album with [[Alturas de Macchu Picchu]] [sic] based on [[Pablo Neruda]]'s homonymous poem. The rock band [[Los Prisioneros]] were successful in combining the protest song atmosphere of the 80s with newer trends in rock including punk, ska, new wave and techno. In late 1980s new bands such as [[Los Tres]] and [[La Ley (band)|La Ley]] would start to set the trends for the next decade.\n\nIn Brazil, even though the 1960s witnessed the phenomenon of [[Jovem Guarda]] and the 1970s saw the appearance of many prolific artists, like [[Raul Seixas]], and bands like [[Os Mutantes]], [[Brazilian rock]]'s explosion began in 1981 with the first expressions of the ''Brazilian new wave'', later renamed the ''New Jovem Guarda'' by the media.\nThe alterations of the English new wave movement, with its surprising variety of styles, arrived in Brazil through groups and personalities such as [[Blitz (Brazilian band)|Blitz]], [[Camisa de V\u00eanus]], [[Bar\u00e3o Vermelho]], [[Kid Abelha]], [[Paralamas do Sucesso]], {{ill|Ritchie (musician)|lt=Ritchie|pt|Ritchie}}, [[Lulu Santos]], [[R\u00e1dio T\u00e1xi]], [[Marina Lima]], [[Engenheiros do Hawaii]], [[RPM (Brazilian band)|RPM]], Graffiti, [[Ultraje a Rigor]], [[Legi\u00e3o Urbana]], [[Ira!]], [[Tit\u00e3s]], [[Capital Inicial]], [[Nenhum de N\u00f3s]], [[Biquini Cavad\u00e3o]], [[Lob\u00e3o]] & Os Ronaldos, [[L\u00e9o Jaime]], and inumerous others.\nIn January 1985, the [[Rock in Rio]] festival took place in [[Rio de Janeiro]], which brought together over one million people to the [[City of Rock|Cidade do Rock]] during the 10 days of the event, and is to this day the country's biggest and most influential festival.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.voltosegunda.com/site/10-maiores-festivais-de-musica-do-mundo/|title=10 maiores festivais de m\u00fasica do mundo|website=Volto Segunda|language=pt|date=March 5, 2016|accessdate=February 13, 2017}}</ref> It represents a milestone in [[Freedom of speech|freedom of expression]], as in that same year the country saw the end of the [[Brazilian military government|dictatorship]],<ref name=\"pav\u00ea\">{{cite web|url=http://musicapave.com/artigos/rockologia-rock-in-rio-e-o-fim-da-ditadura-militar/|title=Rockologia: Rock in Rio e o fim da Ditadura Militar|last=Pinheiro|first=Matheus|website=M\u00fasica Pav\u00ea|language=pt|date=May 20, 2011|accessdate=February 13, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.sidneyrezende.com/noticia/112926|title=Rock in Rio: No dia que cai Ditadura, Bar\u00e3o Vermelho faz show hist\u00f3rico|website=Sidney Rezende|language=pt|date=December 11, 2010|accessdate=February 13, 2017}}</ref> and it is also responsible for establishing Brazil as a venue for international artists - as, so far, foreign attractions had been rarities.<ref name=\"pav\u00ea\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://super.abril.com.br/cultura/rock-in-rio-todo-mundo-junto/|title=Rock in Rio: Todo mundo junto!|website=[[Superinteressante]]|language=pt|date=October 31, 2004|accessdate=February 13, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn Mexico, the Rock music scene at the time first saw heavy lack of opportunity as musical acts could not make a solid living from playing alone. Other key factors were that of economic and political instability. Many consider this decade as the [[La D\u00e9cada Perdida|lost decade]]. The government would not allow racy themed content on television and on the airwaves, music festivals were not allowed. The music that dominated Mexico and much of Latin America during this era were mostly teen flavored acts like [[Menudo (band)|Menudo]], [[Timbiriche]], [[Flans]] and others. \n\nRock acts could not land any recording deal because record label executives were much more interested in selling listeners a colorful, hip and trendy image to the general public ranging from youngsters to middle aged adults. \n\nWith the strong impact of Argentine and [[La Movida Madrile\u00f1a|Spanish rock bands]] by the mid-1980s, the local scene would begin to develop acts that would generate an identity of its own. Among these were bands like [[El Tri]], [[Maldita Vecindad]], Los Amantes de Lola and [[Caifanes]].\n\n=== Salsa ===\nThe [[salsa music]] had developed in the 1960s and '70s by Puerto Rican and [[Cuba]]n immigrants to the [[New York City]] area but did not enter into mainstream popularity in Latin America until the late 1980s. The salsa music became together with [[cumbia]] the two most popular dance music but did not penetrate other countries outside the Caribbean as cumbia did.\n\nThe 1980s was a time of diversification, as popular salsa evolved into sweet and smooth [[salsa romantica]], with lyrics dwelling on love and romance, and its more explicit cousin, [[salsa erotica]]. Salsa romantica can be traced back to ''Noches Calientes'', a 1984 album by singer [[Jos\u00e9 Alberto]] with producer Louie Ramirez. A wave of romantica singers, found wide audience among Latinos in both New York and Puerto Rico.<ref>Manuel, ''Popular Music of the Non-Western World'', pg. 49</ref> The 1980s also saw salsa expand to Mexico, [[Argentina]], [[Peru]], Europe and Japan, and diversify into many new styles.\n\nIn the 1980s some performers experimented with combining elements of salsa with [[hip hop music]], while the producer and pianist [[Sergio George]] helped to revive salsa's commercial success. He created a sound based on prominent trombones and rootsy, mambo-inspired style. He worked with the [[Japanese salsa]] band [[Orquesta de la Luz]], and developed a studio orchestra that included [[Tito Nieves]], Celia Cruz, Jos\u00e9 Alberto, [[La India]], [[Tito Puente]] and [[Luis Enrique (singer)|Luis Enrique]]. The Colombian singer Joe Arroyo first rose to fame in the 1970s, but became a renowned exponent of [[Colombian salsa]] in the 1980s. Arroyo worked for many years with the Colombian arranger [[Fruko y sus Tesos|Fruko and his band Los Tesos]].<ref>Steward, pgs. 493\u2013497</ref>\n\n=== Merengue ===\n[[Merengue music]] would hit its golden years during the 1980s starting in the late 70s with acts such as [[Wilfrido Vargas]], [[Johnny Ventura]], and [[Fernando Villalona]]. Their orchestras would also churn future solo acts such as [[Eddy Herrera]] and [[Rubby Perez]].

However, after several line-up changes, which included the departure of prominent member [[Tim Finn]], the band broke up in 1984 (another prominent [[New Zealand]]/[[Australian]] band, [[Mi-Sex]], known for its hit single \"[[Computer Games (song)|Computer Games]]\", disbanded the same year). [[Neil Finn]], the younger brother of [[Tim Finn]] who had become Split Enz's de facto frontman after his departure in 1983, went on to form [[Crowded House]] in [[New Zealand]] in 1985.  In 1986 [[Crowded House]] released their hugely successful self-titled debut album, which went to number one in [[Australia]] and number three in [[New Zealand]], as well as reaching the top ten in [[Canada]] and top twenty in the [[United States]].  It spawned the song \"[[Don't Dream It's Over]]\", which hit number one in [[New Zealand]] and [[Canada]], number two in the [[United States]] and number eight in [[Australia]], and has since become a pop/rock anthem in [[Australasia]].  Crowded House's follow up album ''[[Temple of Low Men]]'', released in 1988, did not achieve the same success as their debut, but was still popular in the band's homelands of [[New Zealand]] and [[Australia]]...\n\nBack at home, [[New Zealand]] continued to have a small and vibrant music scene, and the eighties saw the formation of many new bands, including [[The Swingers]], [[Coconut Rough]], [[The Crocodiles]] and Peking Man.  Many of these bands were short-lived and did not see much success outside of New Zealand and Australia.\n\n== Asia ==\n{{main|J-pop|Indian pop|C-pop|K-pop}}\n{{see also|Synthpop|Electro (music)|House music|Techno}}\n{{Expand section|date=September 2011}}\n\nIn [[Japan]], bands such as [[Shonen Knife]], [[Boredoms]], [[The Star Club]], [[X Japan]], [[Dead End (band)|Dead End]] and [[The Stalin]] began in the Japanese rock bands and [[Visual kei]] emerged in the 1980s with bands such as [[X Japan]], [[Buck Tick]] and [[D'erlanger]]. Japanese noise rock emerged in the 1980s with bands such as [[Melt-Banana]], [[Zeni Geva]] and [[Guitar Wolf]] in the Japanese's indies scene. \n\n[[City pop]], an adult-oriented genre with western influences of [[disco]], [[funk]], [[soft rock]], and [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] also became popular with the Japanese tech boom. Popular artists in the genre were [[Anri]] and [[Tatsuro Yamashita]]. Most songs were about love or living in the city. The genre was barely known outside of Japan. However, city pop has been getting increasingly popular in the west with Internet-born [[microgenre]] [[vaporwave]]. On May 3, 2019, [[Light in the Attic Records|Light in the Attic]], an independent record label, released Pacific Breeze: Japanese City Pop, AOR, and Boogie 1976-1986. It was a compilation album that showcased what city pop is and its style.\n\n[[Japanese hardcore]] emerged with bands such as [[The Star Club]] and [[GISM]] and [[Japanese idol]] group Onyanko Club began as Idol group in the teen fans and youth fans.\n\nIn addition,  Hong Kong saw a rapid growth in pop music, both in terms of variety and popularity. Big stars such as [[Leslie Cheung]], [[Anita Mui]], [[Danny Chan]], [[Alan Tam]] and [[Beyond (band)|Beyond]] were icons of the decade. The 1980s is still regarded as the most successful period in Hong Kong music history.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|1980s|Music}}\n*[[1970s in music]]\n*[[1990s in music]]\n*[[1960s in music]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*Hill, Dave (1986).

His accomplishments include three NBA championships, four [[NBA Most Valuable Player Award|NBA Most Valuable Player (MVP) Awards]], three [[Bill Russell NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award|Finals MVP Awards]], and two [[Basketball at the Summer Olympics|Olympic gold medals]]. James holds the all-time record for [[List of National Basketball Association career playoff scoring leaders|playoffs points]], is third in [[List of National Basketball Association career scoring leaders|all-time points]], and eighth in [[List of National Basketball Association career assists leaders|all-time assists]]. James was selected to the [[All-NBA Team|All-NBA First Team]] twelve times (all-time record), made the [[NBA All-Defensive Team|All-Defensive First Team]] five times, and has played in sixteen [[List of NBA All-Stars|All-Star Games]], in which he was selected [[NBA All-Star Game MVP Award|All-Star MVP]] three times.\n\nJames played basketball for [[St. Vincent\u2013St. Mary High School]] in his hometown of [[Akron, Ohio]], where he was heavily touted by the national media as a future NBA superstar. A [[prep-to-pro]], he joined Cleveland in [[2003 NBA draft|2003]] as the [[List of first overall NBA draft picks|first overall draft pick]]. Named the [[2003\u201304 NBA season|2003\u201304]] [[NBA Rookie of the Year Award|NBA Rookie of the Year]], he soon established himself as one of the league's premier players, winning the NBA MVP Award in 2009 and 2010. After failing to win a championship with Cleveland, James left in 2010 to sign as a [[Free agent (NBA)|free agent]] with Miami. This move was announced in an [[ESPN]] special titled ''[[The Decision (TV special)|The Decision]]'', and is one of the most controversial free agent decisions in American sports history.\n\nJames won his first two NBA championships while playing for the Heat in [[2012 NBA Finals|2012]] and [[2013 NBA Finals|2013]]; in both of these years, he also earned league MVP and Finals MVP. After his fourth season with the Heat in 2014, James opted out of his contract to re-sign with the Cavaliers. In [[2016 NBA Finals|2016]], he led the Cavaliers to victory over the [[2015\u201316 Golden State Warriors season|Golden State Warriors]] in the [[2016 NBA Finals|NBA Finals]] by [[Comeback (sports)|coming back]] from a 3\u20131 deficit, delivering the franchise's first championship and ending [[Cleveland sports curse|Cleveland's 52-year professional sports title drought]]. In 2018, James opted out of his contract with the Cavaliers to sign with the Lakers.\n\nOff the court, James has accumulated additional wealth and fame from numerous endorsement contracts. His public life has been the subject of much scrutiny, and he has been ranked as one of America's most influential and popular athletes. He has been featured in books, documentaries, and television commercials. He has also hosted the [[ESPY Awards]] and ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', and appeared in the 2015 film ''[[Trainwreck (film)|Trainwreck]]''.
