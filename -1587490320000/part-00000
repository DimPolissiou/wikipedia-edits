Additionally, the X Window System/Unix version publicly provided [[source code]] (source code for the other versions was available after agreements were signed).

Other than displaying images embedded in the text (rather than in a separate window), Mosaic's original feature set is similar to the browsers on which it was modeled, such as ViolaWWW.<ref name=\"faq\" /> But Mosaic was the first browser written and supported by a team of full-time programmers, was reliable and easy enough for novices to install, and the inline graphics reportedly proved immensely appealing.

Mosaic's charming appearance encourages users to load their own documents onto the Net, including color photos, sound bites, video clips, and hypertext \"links\" to other documents. By following the links - click, and the linked document appears - you can travel through the online world along paths of whim and intuition. Mosaic is not the most direct way to find online information. Nor is it the most powerful. It is merely the most pleasurable way, and in the 18 months since it was released, Mosaic has incited a rush of excitement and commercial energy unprecedented in the history of the Net.<ref name=\"The Second Phase\"/>}}\n\nReid also refers to Matthew K.

Mosaic, the first web browser to win over the Net masses, was released in 1993 and made freely accessible to the public. The adjective phenomenal, so often overused in this industry, is genuinely applicable to the... 'explosion' in the growth of the web after Mosaic appeared on the scene.

Web browsers were the first to bring a graphical interface to search tools the Internet's burgeoning wealth of distributed information services.

In its release year of 1993, Mosaic had a What's New page, and about one new link was being added per day. This was a time when access to the Internet was expanding rapidly outside its previous domain of academia and large industrial research institutions. Yet it was the availability of Mosaic and Mosaic-derived graphical browsers themselves that drove the explosive growth of the Web to over 10,000 sites by August 1995 and millions by 1998.<ref>[http://news.netcraft.com/archives/category/web-server-survey/ Web Server Survey | Netcraft].

Most significantly, their work transformed the appeal of the Web from niche uses in the technical area to mass-market appeal. In particular, these University of Illinois students made two key changes to the Web browser, which hyper-boosted its appeal: they added graphics to what was otherwise boring text-based software, and, most importantly, they ported the software from so-called [[Unix]] computers that are popular only in technical and academic circles, to the [Microsoft] Windows operating system, which is used on more than 80 percent of the computers in the world, especially personal and commercial computers.<ref name=\"Architects of the Web\">{{cite book |last=Reid |first=Robert H. |title=Architects of the Web: 1000 Days That Built the Future of Business |publisher=John Wiley and Sons |year=1997 |isbn=0-471-17187-5 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/architectsofweb100reid }}</ref>{{rp|xxv}}}}\n\nMosaic is based on the [[libwww]] [[library (computing)|library]]<ref>{{cite web|last=Kahan|first=Jos\u00e9|title=Change History of libwww|url=http://www.w3.org/Library/User/History.html|publisher=[[World Wide Web Consortium]]|accessdate=30 May 2010|date=7 June 2002}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Petrie|first1=Charles|title=Interview Robert Cailliau on the WWW Proposal: \"How It Really Happened.\"|url=http://www.computer.org/portal/web/computingnow/ic-cailliau|publisher=[[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]]|accessdate=18 August 2010|authorlink2=Robert Cailliau|first2=Robert|last2=Cailliau|date=November 1997|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110106041256/http://www.computer.org/portal/web/computingnow/ic-cailliau|archive-date=6 January 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Why Libwww?|url=http://www.w3.org/Library/Activity.html|accessdate=15 June 2010|date=5 August 1999|first=Jos\u00e9|last=Kahan}}</ref> and thus supported a wide variety of [[Communications protocol|Internet protocols]] included in the library: [[Archie search engine|Archie]], [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]], [[Gopher (protocol)|gopher]], [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTP]], [[Network News Transfer Protocol|NNTP]], [[telnet]], [[Wide area information server|WAIS]].<ref name=\"mosaic and th w3\" />\n\nMosaic is not the first web browser for Microsoft Windows; this is [[Thomas R.

Other than displaying images embedded in the text (rather than in a separate window), Mosaic's original feature set is similar to the browsers on which it was modeled, such as ViolaWWW.<ref name=\"faq\" /> But Mosaic was the first browser written and supported by a team of full-time programmers, was reliable and easy enough for novices to install, and the inline graphics reportedly proved immensely appealing.

Mosaic's charming appearance encourages users to load their own documents onto the Net, including color photos, sound bites, video clips, and hypertext \"links\" to other documents. By following the links - click, and the linked document appears - you can travel through the online world along paths of whim and intuition. Mosaic is not the most direct way to find online information. Nor is it the most powerful. It is merely the most pleasurable way, and in the 18 months since it was released, Mosaic has incited a rush of excitement and commercial energy unprecedented in the history of the Net.<ref name=\"The Second Phase\"/>}}\n\nReid also refers to Matthew K. Gray's website, [https://www.mit.edu/~mkgray/net/ Internet Statistics: Growth and Usage of the Web and the Internet], which indicates a dramatic leap in web use around the time of Mosaic's introduction.<ref name=\"Architects of the Web\"/>{{rp|xxv}}\n\nIn addition, David Hudson concurs with Reid, noting that:\n\n{{quote| text=Marc Andreessen's realization of Mosaic, based on the work of [[Tim Berners-Lee|Berners-Lee]] and the hypertext theorists before him, is generally recognized as the beginning of the web as it is now known. Mosaic, the first web browser to win over the Net masses, was released in 1993 and made freely accessible to the public. The adjective phenomenal, so often overused in this industry, is genuinely applicable to the... 'explosion' in the growth of the web after Mosaic appeared on the scene. Starting with next to nothing, the rates of the web growth (quoted in the press) hovering around tens of thousands of percent over ridiculously short periods of time were no real surprise.<ref name=\"Rewired\">{{cite book |last=Hudson |first=David |title=Rewired: A Brief and Opinionated Net History |location=Indianapolis |publisher=Macmillan Technical Publishing |year=1997 |isbn=1-57870-003-5 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/rewired00huds }}</ref>{{rp|42}}}}\n\nUltimately, web browsers such as Mosaic became the ''[[killer application]]s'' of the 1990s. Web browsers were the first to bring a graphical interface to search tools the Internet's burgeoning wealth of distributed information services. A mid-1994 guide lists Mosaic alongside the traditional, text-oriented information search tools of the time, [[Archie search engine|Archie]] and [[Veronica (search engine)|Veronica]], [[Gopher (protocol)|Gopher]], and [[Wide area information server|WAIS]]<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lucey|first=Sean|title=Internet tools help navigate the busy virtual highway.|journal=MacWeek|date=9 May 1994|page=51}}</ref> but Mosaic quickly subsumed and displaced them all.

In its release year of 1993, Mosaic had a What's New page, and about one new link was being added per day. This was a time when access to the Internet was expanding rapidly outside its previous domain of academia and large industrial research institutions. Yet it was the availability of Mosaic and Mosaic-derived graphical browsers themselves that drove the explosive growth of the Web to over 10,000 sites by August 1995 and millions by 1998.<ref>[http://news.netcraft.com/archives/category/web-server-survey/ Web Server Survey | Netcraft].

This was achieved in circumstances that were far from ideal \u2013 with a small staff, inadequate facilities and temporary accommodation.<ref name=\"Street 150\"/>\n\nIn 1936 she was elected first professor of Botany in the College.\n\nShortly before she retired in 1954 her ambition to establish separate departments of Botany and Zoology with honours degrees in each was realised.<ref name=\":0\" /> She also planned facilities for the new Natural Sciences Building, aware that its use would be for her successors.\n\n'' ''\n[[File:Wallace_Building.jpg|left|thumb|Originally the Natural Sciences Building, now the Wallace Building.

She was Dean of the Faculty of Science during 1933-35 and again during 1941-43.  During the years 1949-51 she was Vice-Principal of the University College.  She was also, for many years, Treasurer of the Students\u2019 Representative Council.\n\nIn 1935, she argued the case for a pay increase for L. Thomas, Laboratory Attendant: 'He is every bit as indispensable to my Department as are the chief laboratory attendants in other science departments of the College, while his wages compare unfavourably with those of most other attendants and also with those of some other College servants, who could be replaced more readily than he could.'<ref>Letter by Florence Mockeridge, 20th Feb 1935.

In the 2nd century BC, the Han dynasty made preparations for [[Han\u2013Xiongnu War|war against Xiongnu]] when [[Emperor Wu of Han]] dispatched the explorer [[Zhang Qian]] to explore the mysterious kingdoms to the west and to form an alliance with the [[Yuezhi]] people in order to combat the Xiongnu. As a result of these battles, the Chinese controlled the strategic region from the [[Ordos Loop|Ordos]] and [[Gansu]] [[Hexi Corridor|corridor]] to [[Lop Nor]]. They succeeded in separating the Xiongnu from the [[Qiang people|Qiang]] peoples to the south, and also gained direct access to the Western Regions. Han China sent Zhang Qian as an envoy to the states in the region, beginning several decades of struggle between the Xiongnu and Han China over dominance of the region, eventually ending in Chinese success. In 60 BC Han China established the [[Protectorate of the Western Regions]] ({{lang|zh-hant|\u897f\u57df\u90fd\u8b77\u5e9c}}) at Wulei ({{lang|zh-hant|\u70cf\u58d8}}, near modern [[Bayin'gholin Mongol Autonomous Prefecture|Luntai]]) to oversee the entire region as far west as the [[Pamir Mountains]], which would remain under the influence and [[suzerainty]] of the Han dynasty with some interruptions. For instance, it fell out of their control during the civil war against [[Wang Mang]] (r. AD 9\u201323). It was brought back under Han control in AD 91 due to the efforts of the general [[Ban Chao]].\n\nThe Western [[Jin dynasty (265\u2013420)|Jin dynasty]] succumbed to successive waves of invasions by nomads from the north at the beginning of the 4th century. The short-lived kingdoms that ruled northwestern China one after the other, including [[Former Liang]], [[Former Qin]], [[Later Liang (Sixteen Kingdoms)|Later Liang]], and [[Western Liang (Sixteen Kingdoms)|Western Li\u00e1ng]], all attempted to maintain the protectorate, with varying degrees of success.

This Uyghur state remained in eastern Xinjiang until the 13th century, though it was subject to foreign overlords during that time. The Kara-Khanids converted to Islam. The Uyghur state in eastern Xinjiang remained [[Manichaeism|Manichaean]], but later converted to [[Buddhism]].\n\nIn 1132, remnants of the [[Liao dynasty]] from [[Manchuria]] entered Xinjiang, fleeing the rebellion of their neighbors, the [[Jurchens]]. They established a new empire, the [[Qara Khitai]], which ruled over both the Kara-Khanid-held and Uyghur-held parts of the Tarim Basin for the next century. Although Khitan and Chinese were the primary languages of administration, the empire also administered in Persian and [[Uyghur language|Uyghur]].<ref>''The Empire of the Qara Khitai in Eurasian History: Between China and the Islamic World'', pp. 94</ref>\n\n=== Islamisation of Xinjiang ===\n{{main|Islamization of Xinjiang}}\n{{Islam and China|places}}\n\nThe historical area of what is contemporary Xinjiang consisted of the distinct areas of the [[Tarim Basin]] and [[Dzungaria]], and was originally populated by Indo-European [[Tocharians|Tocharian]] and Iranic [[Saka]] peoples who practiced the [[Buddhist]] religion.

The cultural change was carried out in the 9th and 10th centuries by two different Turkic kingdoms, the Buddhist Uyghur [[Kingdom of Qocho]] and the Muslim [[Karluks|Karluk]] [[Kara-Khanid Khanate]]. Halfway through the 10th century the Saka Buddhist [[Kingdom of Khotan]] came under attack by the Turkic Muslim Karakhanid ruler Musa, and in what proved to be a pivotal moment in the Islamicisation of the [[Tarim Basin]], the Karakhanid leader [[Yusuf Qadir Khan]] conquered [[Khotan]] around 1006.{{sfnp|Millward |2007 |p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=8FVsWq31MtMC&pg=PA55 55]}}\n\nProfessor James A.

[[Four Oirat]]. 3.[[Moghulistan]] 4.[[Qara Del]]]]\n\nAfter [[Genghis Khan]] unified [[Mongolia]] and began his advance west, the Uyghur state in the Turpan-Urumchi area offered its allegiance to the Mongols in 1209, contributing taxes and troops to the Mongol imperial effort. In return, the Uyghur rulers retained control of their kingdom. By contrast, Genghis Khan's [[Mongol Empire]] conquered the [[Qara Khitai]] in 1218.\n\nXinjiang was a stronghold of [[Ogedai]] and later came under the control of his descendant [[Kaidu]]. This branch of the Mongol family kept the Yuan dynasty at bay until their rule came to an end.\n\nDuring the era of the Mongol Empire, the [[Yuan dynasty]] vied with the [[Chagatai Khanate]] for rule over the area, with the latter taking control of most of this region. After the break-up of the Chagatai Khanate into smaller [[khanates]] in the mid-14th century, the region fractured and was ruled by numerous Persianized Mongol Khans simultaneously, including the ones of [[Moghulistan]] (with the assistance of the local Dughlat Emirs), Uigurstan (later Turpan), and Kashgaria. These leaders engaged in wars with each other and the [[Timurid Empire|Timurid]]s of [[Transoxania]] to the west and the [[Oirats]] to the east, the successor Chagatai regime based in Mongolia and in China. In the 17th century, the [[Dzungars]] established an empire over much of the region.\n\nThe Mongolian Dzungar was the collective identity of several [[Oirats|Oirat]] tribes that formed and maintained one of the last [[nomadic empire]]s. The [[Dzungar Khanate]] covered the area called [[Dzungaria]] and stretched from the west end of the [[Great Wall of China]] to present-day eastern Kazakhstan, and from present-day northern [[Kyrgyzstan]] to southern [[Siberia]]. Most of this area was only renamed \"Xinjiang\" by the Chinese after the fall of the Dzungar Empire. It existed from the early 17th century to the mid-18th century.\n[[File:Qing Dzungar wars.jpg|thumb|Map showing [[Dzungar\u2013Qing Wars]] between the Qing Dynasty and [[Dzungar Khanate]]]]\nThe Turkic Muslim sedentary people of the Tarim Basin were originally ruled by the [[Chagatai Khanate]] while the nomadic Buddhist Oirat Mongol in Dzungaria ruled over the [[Dzungar Khanate]]. The Naqshbandi Sufi [[Khoja (Turkestan)|Khoja]]s, descendants of the Islamic prophet, Muhammad, had replaced the Chagatayid Khans as the ruling authority of the Tarim Basin in the early 17th century. There was a struggle between two factions of Khojas, the Afaqi (White Mountain) faction and the Ishaqi (Black Mountain) faction. The Ishaqi defeated the Afaqi, which resulted in the [[Afaq Khoja]] inviting the [[5th Dalai Lama]], the leader of the [[Tibetan people|Tibetans]], to intervene on his behalf in 1677. The 5th Dalai Lama then called upon his Dzungar Buddhist followers in the Dzungar Khanate to act on this invitation. The Dzungar Khanate then conquered the Tarim Basin in 1680, setting up the Afaqi Khoja as their puppet ruler.\n\nAfter converting to Islam, the descendants of the previously [[Kingdom of Qocho|Buddhist Uyghurs in Turfan]] failed to retain memory of their ancestral legacy and falsely believed that the \"infidel Kalmuks\" ([[Dzungar people|Dzungars]]) were the ones who built Buddhist monuments in their area.<ref name=\"GibbLewis1998\">{{cite book|author1=Hamilton Alexander Rosskeen Gibb|author2=Bernard Lewis|author3=Johannes Hendrik Kramers |author4=Charles Pellat |author5=Joseph Schacht|title=The Encyclopaedia of Islam|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PJPrAAAAMAAJ|year=1998|publisher=Brill|page=677}}</ref>\n\n=== Qing dynasty ===\n{{Main|Xinjiang under Qing rule}}\n[[File:Battle of Oroi-Jalatu.jpg|thumb|right|The Battle of Oroi-Jalatu in 1756 between the Manchu and Oirat armies]]\n[[File:Battle at Awabat-chuang.jpg|thumb|right|A scene of the Qing campaign against rebels in [[Altishahr]], 1828]]\n\nThe Turkic Muslims of the Turfan and Kumul Oases then submitted to the [[Qing dynasty]] of China, and asked China to free them from the Dzungars. The Qing accepted the rulers of Turfan and Kumul as Qing vassals. The Qing dynasty waged war against the Dzungars for decades until finally defeating them and then Qing Manchu [[Eight Banners|Bannermen]] carried out the [[Dzungar genocide]], nearly wiping them from existence and depopulating Dzungaria. The Qing then freed the Afaqi Khoja leader Burhan-ud-din and his brother Khoja Jihan from their imprisonment by the Dzungars, and appointed them to rule as Qing vassals over the Tarim Basin. The Khoja brothers decided to renege on this deal and declare themselves as independent leaders of the Tarim Basin. The Qing and the Turfan leader Emin Khoja crushed their revolt and China then took full control of both Dzungaria and the Tarim Basin by 1759.\n\nThe [[Manchu people|Manchu]] Qing dynasty of China gained control over eastern Xinjiang as a result of a [[Dzungar\u2013Qing War|long struggle with the Dzungars]] that began in the 17th century. In 1755, with the help of the Oirat noble [[Amursana]], the Qing attacked [[Yining City|Ghulja]] and captured the Dzungar khan. After Amursana's request to be declared Dzungar khan went unanswered, he led a revolt against the Qing. Over the next two years, Qing armies destroyed the remnants of the Dzungar Khanate and many Han Chinese and ([[Hui people|Hui]]) moved into the pacified areas.{{sfnp|Millward |2007 |p=98}}\n\n[[File:Qing Empire circa 1820 EN.svg|thumb|left|The [[Qing dynasty|Qing Empire]] ca. 1820]]\nThe native [[Dzungar people|Dzungar Oirat Mongols]] suffered heavily from the brutal campaigns and a simultaneous [[smallpox]] epidemic.

==\n[[File:Karakorum-d04.jpg|thumb|Close to [[Karakoram Highway]] in Xinjiang.]]\n[[File:Turpan-flaming-mountains-camellos-d01.jpg|thumb|[[Flaming Mountains]].]]\n[[File:Fly over Pamir Mountains and Karakoram Highway.jpg|thumb|[[Pamir Mountains]] and [[Muztagh Ata]].]]\n\nXinjiang is the largest [[Administrative divisions of the People's Republic of China|political subdivision of China]]\u2014it accounts for more than one sixth of China's total territory and a quarter of its boundary length. Xinjiang is mostly covered with uninhabitable deserts and dry grasslands, with dotted oases at the foot of [[Tian Shan]], [[Kunlun Mountains]] and [[Altai Mountains]]. The inhabitable oasis accounts for 9.7% of Xinjiang's total area by 2015.<ref name=\"oasis\"/>\n\n=== Mountain systems and basins ===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2019}}\nXinjiang is split by the [[Tian Shan]] mountain range ({{ug-textonly|\u062a\u06d5\u06ad\u0631\u0649 \u062a\u0627\u063a}}, Tengri Tagh, \u0422\u04d9\u04a3\u0440\u0438 \u0422\u0430\u0493), which divides it into two large basins: the [[Dzungarian Basin]] in the north and the [[Tarim Basin]] in the south. A small V-shaped wedge between these two major basins, limited by the Tian Shan's main range in the south and the [[Borohoro Mountains]] in the north, is the basin of the [[Ili River]], which flows into Kazakhstan's [[Lake Balkhash]]; an even smaller wedge farther north is the [[Emin Valley]].\n\nOther major mountain ranges of Xinjiang include the [[Pamir Mountains]] and [[Karakoram]] in the southwest, the [[Kunlun Mountains]] in the south (along the border with [[Tibet Autonomous Region|Tibet]]) and the [[Altai Mountains]] in the northeast (shared with [[Mongolia]]). The region's highest point is the mountain [[K2]], [[eight-thousander|8611 metres above sea level]], in the Karakoram Mountains on the border with [[Pakistan]].\n\nMuch of the Tarim Basin is dominated by the [[Taklamakan Desert]]. North of it is the [[Turpan Depression]], which contains the lowest point in Xinjiang and in the entire PRC, at 155 metres below sea level.\n\nThe Dzungarian Basin is slightly cooler, and receives somewhat more precipitation, than the Tarim Basin. Nonetheless, it, too, has a large [[Gurbant\u00fcngg\u00fct Desert]] (also known as Dzoosotoyn Elisen) in its center.\n\nThe [[Tian Shan]] mountain range marks the Xinjiang-Kyrgyzstan border at the [[Torugart Pass]] (3752 m). The [[Karakorum highway]] (KKH) links [[Islamabad]], Pakistan with [[Kashgar]] over the [[Khunjerab Pass]].\n\n=== Geology ===\nXinjiang is young geologically. Collision of the Indian and the Eurasian plates formed the [[Tian Shan]], [[Kunlun Shan]], and [[Pamir Mountains|Pamir]] mountain ranges. Xinjiang is a very active earthquake zone. Older geological formations are located in the far north, where the [[Junggar Block]] is geologically part of [[Kazakhstan]], and in the east, where is part of the [[North China Craton]].\n\n===Center of the continent===\nXinjiang has within its borders, in the [[Dzoosotoyn Elisen Desert]], the location in [[Eurasia]] that is furthest from the sea in any direction (a [[continental pole of inaccessibility]]): {{coord|46|16.8|N|86|40.2|E|type:landmark|name=Eurasian pole of inaccessibility}}. It is at least {{convert|1645|mi|km|abbr=on|order=flip}} (straight-line distance) from any coastline.\n\nIn 1992, local geographers determined another point within Xinjiang{{spaced ndash}}{{coord|43|40|52|N|87|19|52|E}} in the southwestern suburbs of [[\u00dcr\u00fcmqi]], [[\u00dcr\u00fcmqi County]]{{spaced ndash}}to be the \"center point of Asia\". A [[Geographical Center of Asian Continent|monument to this effect]] was then erected there and the site has become a local tourist attraction.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.confluence.org/confluence.php?visitid=12710|title=DCP: Geographic Center of Asia (visit #1)|website=www.confluence.org|access-date=13 October 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160602180943/http://www.confluence.org/confluence.php?visitid=12710|archive-date=2 June 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Rivers and lakes ===\n[[File:Tianchi Lake.jpg|thumb|left|[[Tianchi Lake (Tianshan)|Tianchi Lake]]]]\n[[File:ColourfulBeach.jpg|thumb|Black [[Irtysh]] river in [[Burqin County]] is a famous spot for [[sightseeing]].]]\nHaving hot summer and low precipitation, most of Xinjiang is [[endorheic]]. Its rivers either disappear in the desert, or terminate in salt lakes (within Xinjiang itself, or in neighboring Kazakhstan), instead of running towards an ocean. The northernmost part of the region, with the [[Irtysh River]] rising in the Altai Mountains, that flows (via Kazakhstan and Russia) toward the [[Arctic Ocean]], is the only exception. But even so, a significant part of the Irtysh's waters were artificially diverted via the [[Irtysh\u2013Karamay\u2013\u00dcr\u00fcmqi Canal]] to the drier regions of southern [[Dzungarian Basin]].\n\n[[File:LakeKanas.jpg|thumb|[[Kanas Lake]]]] \nElsewhere, most of Xinjiang's rivers are comparatively short streams fed by the snows of the several ranges of the Tian Shan. Once they enter the populated areas in the mountains' foothills, their waters are extensively used for irrigation, so that the river often disappears in the desert instead of reaching the lake to whose basin it nominally belongs. This is the case even with the main river of the [[Tarim Basin]], the [[Tarim River|Tarim]], which has been dammed at a number of locations along its course, and whose waters have been completely diverted before they can reach the [[Lop Lake]]. In the Dzungarian basin, a similar situation occurs with most rivers that historically flowed into [[Lake Manas]]. Some of the salt lakes, having lost much of their fresh water inflow, are now extensively use for the production of mineral salts (used e.g., in the manufacturing of [[potassium]] fertilizers); this includes the Lop Lake and the Manas Lake.\n\n=== Time ===\n{{main|Xinjiang Time|Time in China#Xinjiang}}\nXinjiang has the same time belt as the rest of China, Beijing time, UTC+8. But while Xinjiang being about two time zones west of Beijing, some residents, local organizations and governments watch another time standard known as [[Xinjiang Time]], UTC+6.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.xinjiang.gov.cn/10018/10008/00017/2005/22694.htm |title=The Working-Calendar for The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Government |url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111204115929/http://www.xinjiang.gov.cn/10018/10008/00017/2005/22694.htm |archive-date=4 December 2011 }}</ref> Han people tend to use Beijing Time, while Uyghurs tend to use Xinjiang Time as a form of resistance to Beijing.<ref name=Han>{{cite journal |last=Han |first=Enze |title=Boundaries, Discrimination, and Interethnic Conflict in Xinjiang, China |journal=International Journal of Conflict and Violence |volume=4 |issue=2 |year=2010 |page=251 |url=http://www.ijcv.org/index.php/ijcv/article/download/77/196 |access-date=14 December 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141019103838/http://www.ijcv.org/index.php/ijcv/article/download/77/196 |archive-date=19 October 2014 |url-status=live  }}</ref> But, regardless of the time standard preferences, most businesses, schools open and close two hours later than in the other regions of China.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://articles.latimes.com/2009/mar/31/world/fg-china-timezone31/2|title=Clocks square off in China's far west|first=Barbara|last=Demick|date=31 March 2009|via=LA Times|access-date=14 December 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121217031320/http://articles.latimes.com/2009/mar/31/world/fg-china-timezone31/2|archive-date=17 December 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Deserts ===\nDeserts include:\n* [[Gurbant\u00fcngg\u00fct Desert]], also known as ''Dzoosotoyn Elisen''\n* [[Taklamakan Desert]]\n* [[Kumtag Desert]], east of Taklamakan\n\n=== Major cities ===\nDue to the water situation, most of Xinjiang's population lives within fairly narrow belts that are stretched along the foothills of the region's mountain ranges, where irrigated agriculture can be practised.

According to the Asia-Pacific Center for Security Studies, the two main sources for [[separatism]] in the Xinjiang Province are religion and ethnicity. Religiously, the Uyghur peoples of Xinjiang follow [[Islam]], while in the large cities of Han China, the primary religions practiced are [[Buddhism]], [[Confucianism]], [[Taoism]] or a combination of them. The other major difference and source of friction with eastern China is ethnicity. The Uyghurs are ethnically, linguistically, and culturally Turkic, a clear distinction from the Han and other ethnicities that are the majority in the eastern regions of China. Hence, there is a noticeable voice of ethnic Uyghurs who would like to separate their region from China.

The rugged [[Karakoram]], [[Kunlun Mountains|Kunlun]] and [[Tian Shan]] mountain ranges occupy much of Xinjiang's borders, as well as its western and southern regions. Xinjiang also borders the [[Tibet Autonomous Region]] and the provinces of [[Gansu]] and [[Qinghai]]. The most well-known route of the historical [[Silk Road]] ran through the territory from the east to its northwestern border.\n\nIn recent decades, abundant oil and mineral reserves have been found in Xinjiang and it is currently China's largest natural-gas-producing region.\n\nIt is home to a number of ethnic groups, including the [[Uyghurs|Uyghur]], [[Han Chinese|Han]], [[Kazakhs]], [[Tibetan people|Tibetans]], [[Hui people|Hui]], [[Tajiks]], [[Kyrgyz people|Kyrgyz]], [[Mongols in China|Mongols]], [[Russians in China|Russians]] and [[Xibe people|Xibe]].<ref name=\"news.bbc.co.uk\">{{cite web |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/country_profiles/8152132.stm |work=BBC News |title=Regions and territories: Xinjiang |date=7 May 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110520054144/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/country_profiles/8152132.stm |archive-date=20 May 2011}}</ref> More than a dozen autonomous prefectures and counties for minorities are in Xinjiang.

Since 1949, it has been part of the People's Republic of China following the [[Chinese Civil War]]. In 1954, [[Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps|Xinjiang Bingtuan]] was set up to strengthen the border defense against the Soviet Union and also promote the local economy. In 1955, Xinjiang was turned into an [[Autonomous administrative divisions of China|autonomous region]] from a province. In the last decades, the [[East Turkestan]] independent movement, [[Xinjiang conflict|separatist conflict]] and the influence of radical Islam have both resulted in unrest in the region, with

In the 2nd century BC, the Han dynasty made preparations for [[Han\u2013Xiongnu War|war against Xiongnu]] when [[Emperor Wu of Han]] dispatched the explorer [[Zhang Qian]] to explore the mysterious kingdoms to the west and to form an alliance with the [[Yuezhi]] people in order to combat the Xiongnu. As a result of these battles, the Chinese controlled the strategic region from the [[Ordos Loop|Ordos]] and [[Gansu]] [[Hexi Corridor|corridor]] to [[Lop Nor]]. They succeeded in separating the Xiongnu from the [[Qiang people|Qiang]] peoples to the south, and also gained direct access to the Western Regions. Han China sent Zhang Qian as an envoy to the states in the region, beginning several decades of struggle between the Xiongnu and Han China over dominance of the region, eventually ending in Chinese success. In 60 BC Han China established the [[Protectorate of the Western Regions]] ({{lang|zh-hant|\u897f\u57df\u90fd\u8b77\u5e9c}}) at Wulei ({{lang|zh-hant|\u70cf\u58d8}}, near modern [[Bayin'gholin Mongol Autonomous Prefecture|Luntai]]) to oversee the entire region as far west as the [[Pamir Mountains]], which would remain under the influence and [[suzerainty]] of the Han dynasty with some interruptions. For instance, it fell out of their control during the civil war against [[Wang Mang]] (r. AD 9\u201323). It was brought back under Han control in AD 91 due to the efforts of the general [[Ban Chao]].\n\nThe Western [[Jin dynasty (265\u2013420)|Jin dynasty]] succumbed to successive waves of invasions by nomads from the north at the beginning of the 4th century. The short-lived kingdoms that ruled northwestern China one after the other, including [[Former Liang]], [[Former Qin]], [[Later Liang (Sixteen Kingdoms)|Later Liang]], and [[Western Liang (Sixteen Kingdoms)|Western Li\u00e1ng]], all attempted to maintain the protectorate, with varying degrees of success.

This Uyghur state remained in eastern Xinjiang until the 13th century, though it was subject to foreign overlords during that time. The Kara-Khanids converted to Islam. The Uyghur state in eastern Xinjiang remained [[Manichaeism|Manichaean]], but later converted to [[Buddhism]].\n\nIn 1132, remnants of the [[Liao dynasty]] from [[Manchuria]] entered Xinjiang, fleeing the rebellion of their neighbors, the [[Jurchens]]. They established a new empire, the [[Qara Khitai]], which ruled over both the Kara-Khanid-held and Uyghur-held parts of the Tarim Basin for the next century. Although Khitan and Chinese were the primary languages of administration, the empire also administered in Persian and [[Uyghur language|Uyghur]].<ref>''The Empire of the Qara Khitai in Eurasian History: Between China and the Islamic World'', pp. 94</ref>\n\n=== Islamisation of Xinjiang ===\n{{main|Islamization of Xinjiang}}\n{{Islam and China|places}}\n\nThe historical area of what is contemporary Xinjiang consisted of the distinct areas of the [[Tarim Basin]] and [[Dzungaria]], and was originally populated by Indo-European [[Tocharians|Tocharian]] and Iranic [[Saka]] peoples who practiced the [[Buddhist]] religion.

The cultural change was carried out in the 9th and 10th centuries by two different Turkic kingdoms, the Buddhist Uyghur [[Kingdom of Qocho]] and the Muslim [[Karluks|Karluk]] [[Kara-Khanid Khanate]]. Halfway through the 10th century the Saka Buddhist [[Kingdom of Khotan]] came under attack by the Turkic Muslim Karakhanid ruler Musa, and in what proved to be a pivotal moment in the Islamicisation of the [[Tarim Basin]], the Karakhanid leader [[Yusuf Qadir Khan]] conquered [[Khotan]] around 1006.{{sfnp|Millward |2007 |p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=8FVsWq31MtMC&pg=PA55 55]}}\n\nProfessor James A.

[[Four Oirat]]. 3.[[Moghulistan]] 4.[[Qara Del]]]]\n\nAfter [[Genghis Khan]] unified [[Mongolia]] and began his advance west, the Uyghur state in the Turpan-Urumchi area offered its allegiance to the Mongols in 1209, contributing taxes and troops to the Mongol imperial effort. In return, the Uyghur rulers retained control of their kingdom. By contrast, Genghis Khan's [[Mongol Empire]] conquered the [[Qara Khitai]] in 1218.\n\nXinjiang was a stronghold of [[Ogedai]] and later came under the control of his descendant [[Kaidu]]. This branch of the Mongol family kept the Yuan dynasty at bay until their rule came to an end.\n\nDuring the era of the Mongol Empire, the [[Yuan dynasty]] vied with the [[Chagatai Khanate]] for rule over the area, with the latter taking control of most of this region. After the break-up of the Chagatai Khanate into smaller [[khanates]] in the mid-14th century, the region fractured and was ruled by numerous Persianized Mongol Khans simultaneously, including the ones of [[Moghulistan]] (with the assistance of the local Dughlat Emirs), Uigurstan (later Turpan), and Kashgaria. These leaders engaged in wars with each other and the [[Timurid Empire|Timurid]]s of [[Transoxania]] to the west and the [[Oirats]] to the east, the successor Chagatai regime based in Mongolia and in China. In the 17th century, the [[Dzungars]] established an empire over much of the region.\n\nThe Mongolian Dzungar was the collective identity of several [[Oirats|Oirat]] tribes that formed and maintained one of the last [[nomadic empire]]s. The [[Dzungar Khanate]] covered the area called [[Dzungaria]] and stretched from the west end of the [[Great Wall of China]] to present-day eastern Kazakhstan, and from present-day northern [[Kyrgyzstan]] to southern [[Siberia]]. Most of this area was only renamed \"Xinjiang\" by the Chinese after the fall of the Dzungar Empire. It existed from the early 17th century to the mid-18th century.\n[[File:Qing Dzungar wars.jpg|thumb|Map showing [[Dzungar\u2013Qing Wars]] between Qing Dynasty and [[Dzungar Khanate]]]]\nThe Turkic Muslim sedentary people of the Tarim Basin were originally ruled by the [[Chagatai Khanate]] while the nomadic Buddhist Oirat Mongol in Dzungaria ruled over the [[Dzungar Khanate]]. The Naqshbandi Sufi [[Khoja (Turkestan)|Khoja]]s, descendants of the Islamic prophet, Muhammad, had replaced the Chagatayid Khans as the ruling authority of the Tarim Basin in the early 17th century. There was a struggle between two factions of Khojas, the Afaqi (White Mountain) faction and the Ishaqi (Black Mountain) faction. The Ishaqi defeated the Afaqi, which resulted in the [[Afaq Khoja]] inviting the [[5th Dalai Lama]], the leader of the [[Tibetan people|Tibetans]], to intervene on his behalf in 1677. The 5th Dalai Lama then called upon his Dzungar Buddhist followers in the Dzungar Khanate to act on this invitation. The Dzungar Khanate then conquered the Tarim Basin in 1680, setting up the Afaqi Khoja as their puppet ruler.\n\nAfter converting to Islam, the descendants of the previously [[Kingdom of Qocho|Buddhist Uyghurs in Turfan]] failed to retain memory of their ancestral legacy and falsely believed that the \"infidel Kalmuks\" ([[Dzungar people|Dzungars]]) were the ones who built Buddhist monuments in their area.<ref name=\"GibbLewis1998\">{{cite book|author1=Hamilton Alexander Rosskeen Gibb|author2=Bernard Lewis|author3=Johannes Hendrik Kramers |author4=Charles Pellat |author5=Joseph Schacht|title=The Encyclopaedia of Islam|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PJPrAAAAMAAJ|year=1998|publisher=Brill|page=677}}</ref>\n\n=== Qing dynasty ===\n{{Main|Xinjiang under Qing rule}}\n[[File:Battle of Oroi-Jalatu.jpg|thumb|right|The Battle of Oroi-Jalatu in 1756 between the Manchu and Oirat armies]]\n[[File:Battle at Awabat-chuang.jpg|thumb|right|A scene of the Qing campaign against rebels in [[Altishahr]], 1828]]\n\nThe Turkic Muslims of the Turfan and Kumul Oases then submitted to the [[Qing dynasty]] of China, and asked China to free them from the Dzungars. The Qing accepted the rulers of Turfan and Kumul as Qing vassals. The Qing dynasty waged war against the Dzungars for decades until finally defeating them and then Qing Manchu [[Eight Banners|Bannermen]] carried out the [[Dzungar genocide]], nearly wiping them from existence and depopulating Dzungaria. The Qing then freed the Afaqi Khoja leader Burhan-ud-din and his brother Khoja Jihan from their imprisonment by the Dzungars, and appointed them to rule as Qing vassals over the Tarim Basin. The Khoja brothers decided to renege on this deal and declare themselves as independent leaders of the Tarim Basin. The Qing and the Turfan leader Emin Khoja crushed their revolt and China then took full control of both Dzungaria and the Tarim Basin by 1759.\n\nThe [[Manchu people|Manchu]] Qing dynasty of China gained control over eastern Xinjiang as a result of a [[Dzungar\u2013Qing War|long struggle with the Dzungars]] that began in the 17th century. In 1755, with the help of the Oirat noble [[Amursana]], the Qing attacked [[Yining City|Ghulja]] and captured the Dzungar khan. After Amursana's request to be declared Dzungar khan went unanswered, he led a revolt against the Qing. Over the next two years, Qing armies destroyed the remnants of the Dzungar Khanate and many Han Chinese and ([[Hui people|Hui]]) moved into the pacified areas.{{sfnp|Millward |2007 |p=98}}\n\n[[File:Qing Empire circa 1820 EN.svg|thumb|left|The [[Qing dynasty|Qing Empire]] ca. 1820]]\nThe native [[Dzungar people|Dzungar Oirat Mongols]] suffered heavily from the brutal campaigns and a simultaneous [[smallpox]] epidemic.

==\n[[File:Karakorum-d04.jpg|thumb|Close to [[Karakoram Highway]] in Xinjiang.]]\n[[File:Turpan-flaming-mountains-camellos-d01.jpg|thumb|[[Flaming Mountains]].]]\n[[File:Fly over Pamir Mountains and Karakoram Highway.jpg|thumb|[[Pamir Mountains]] and [[Muztagh Ata]].]]\n\nXinjiang is the largest [[Administrative divisions of the People's Republic of China|political subdivision of China]]\u2014it accounts for more than one sixth of China's total territory and a quarter of its boundary length. Xinjiang is mostly covered with uninhabitable deserts and dry grasslands, with dotted oases at the foot of [[Tian Shan]], [[Kunlun Mountains]] and [[Altai Mountains]]. The inhabitable oasis accounts for 9.7% of Xinjiang's total area by 2015.<ref name=\"oasis\"/>\n\n=== Mountain systems and basins ===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2019}}\nXinjiang is split by the [[Tian Shan]] mountain range ({{ug-textonly|\u062a\u06d5\u06ad\u0631\u0649 \u062a\u0627\u063a}}, Tengri Tagh, \u0422\u04d9\u04a3\u0440\u0438 \u0422\u0430\u0493), which divides it into two large basins: the [[Dzungarian Basin]] in the north and the [[Tarim Basin]] in the south. A small V-shaped wedge between these two major basins, limited by the Tian Shan's main range in the south and the [[Borohoro Mountains]] in the north, is the basin of the [[Ili River]], which flows into Kazakhstan's [[Lake Balkhash]]; an even smaller wedge farther north is the [[Emin Valley]].\n\nOther major mountain ranges of Xinjiang include the [[Pamir Mountains]] and [[Karakoram]] in the southwest, the [[Kunlun Mountains]] in the south (along the border with [[Tibet Autonomous Region|Tibet]]) and the [[Altai Mountains]] in the northeast (shared with [[Mongolia]]). The region's highest point is the mountain [[K2]], [[eight-thousander|8611 metres above sea level]], in the Karakoram Mountains on the border with [[Pakistan]].\n\nMuch of the Tarim Basin is dominated by the [[Taklamakan Desert]]. North of it is the [[Turpan Depression]], which contains the lowest point in Xinjiang and in the entire PRC, at 155 metres below sea level.\n\nThe Dzungarian Basin is slightly cooler, and receives somewhat more precipitation, than the Tarim Basin. Nonetheless, it, too, has a large [[Gurbant\u00fcngg\u00fct Desert]] (also known as Dzoosotoyn Elisen) in its center.\n\nThe [[Tian Shan]] mountain range marks the Xinjiang-Kyrgyzstan border at the [[Torugart Pass]] (3752 m). The [[Karakorum highway]] (KKH) links [[Islamabad]], Pakistan with [[Kashgar]] over the [[Khunjerab Pass]].\n\n=== Geology ===\nXinjiang is young geologically. Collision of the Indian and the Eurasian plates formed the [[Tian Shan]], [[Kunlun Shan]], and [[Pamir Mountains|Pamir]] mountain ranges. Xinjiang is a very active earthquake zone. Older geological formations are located in the far north, where the [[Junggar Block]] is geologically part of [[Kazakhstan]], and in the east, where is part of the [[North China Craton]].\n\n===Center of the continent===\nXinjiang has within its borders, in the [[Dzoosotoyn Elisen Desert]], the location in [[Eurasia]] that is furthest from the sea in any direction (a [[continental pole of inaccessibility]]): {{coord|46|16.8|N|86|40.2|E|type:landmark|name=Eurasian pole of inaccessibility}}. It is at least {{convert|1645|mi|km|abbr=on|order=flip}} (straight-line distance) from any coastline.\n\nIn 1992, local geographers determined another point within Xinjiang{{spaced ndash}}{{coord|43|40|52|N|87|19|52|E}} in the southwestern suburbs of [[\u00dcr\u00fcmqi]], [[\u00dcr\u00fcmqi County]]{{spaced ndash}}to be the \"center point of Asia\". A [[Geographical Center of Asian Continent|monument to this effect]] was then erected there and the site has become a local tourist attraction.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.confluence.org/confluence.php?visitid=12710|title=DCP: Geographic Center of Asia (visit #1)|website=www.confluence.org|access-date=13 October 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160602180943/http://www.confluence.org/confluence.php?visitid=12710|archive-date=2 June 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Rivers and lakes ===\n[[File:Tianchi Lake.jpg|thumb|left|[[Tianchi Lake (Tianshan)|Tianchi Lake]]]]\n[[File:ColourfulBeach.jpg|thumb|Black [[Irtysh]] river in [[Burqin County]] is a famous spot for [[sightseeing]].]]\nHaving hot summer and low precipitation, most of Xinjiang is [[endorheic]]. Its rivers either disappear in the desert, or terminate in salt lakes (within Xinjiang itself, or in neighboring Kazakhstan), instead of running towards an ocean. The northernmost part of the region, with the [[Irtysh River]] rising in the Altai Mountains, that flows (via Kazakhstan and Russia) toward the [[Arctic Ocean]], is the only exception. But even so, a significant part of the Irtysh's waters were artificially diverted via the [[Irtysh\u2013Karamay\u2013\u00dcr\u00fcmqi Canal]] to the drier regions of southern [[Dzungarian Basin]].\n\n[[File:LakeKanas.jpg|thumb|[[Kanas Lake]]]] \nElsewhere, most of Xinjiang's rivers are comparatively short streams fed by the snows of the several ranges of the Tian Shan. Once they enter the populated areas in the mountains' foothills, their waters are extensively used for irrigation, so that the river often disappears in the desert instead of reaching the lake to whose basin it nominally belongs. This is the case even with the main river of the [[Tarim Basin]], the [[Tarim River|Tarim]], which has been dammed at a number of locations along its course, and whose waters have been completely diverted before they can reach the [[Lop Lake]]. In the Dzungarian basin, a similar situation occurs with most rivers that historically flowed into [[Lake Manas]]. Some of the salt lakes, having lost much of their fresh water inflow, are now extensively use for the production of mineral salts (used e.g., in the manufacturing of [[potassium]] fertilizers); this includes the Lop Lake and the Manas Lake.\n\n=== Time ===\n{{main|Xinjiang Time|Time in China#Xinjiang}}\nXinjiang has the same time belt as the rest of China, Beijing time, UTC+8. But while Xinjiang being about two time zones west of Beijing, some residents, local organizations and governments watch another time standard known as [[Xinjiang Time]], UTC+6.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.xinjiang.gov.cn/10018/10008/00017/2005/22694.htm |title=The Working-Calendar for The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Government |url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111204115929/http://www.xinjiang.gov.cn/10018/10008/00017/2005/22694.htm |archive-date=4 December 2011 }}</ref> Han people tend to use Beijing Time, while Uyghurs tend to use Xinjiang Time as a form of resistance to Beijing.<ref name=Han>{{cite journal |last=Han |first=Enze |title=Boundaries, Discrimination, and Interethnic Conflict in Xinjiang, China |journal=International Journal of Conflict and Violence |volume=4 |issue=2 |year=2010 |page=251 |url=http://www.ijcv.org/index.php/ijcv/article/download/77/196 |access-date=14 December 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141019103838/http://www.ijcv.org/index.php/ijcv/article/download/77/196 |archive-date=19 October 2014 |url-status=live  }}</ref> But, regardless of the time standard preferences, most businesses, schools open and close two hours later than in the other regions of China.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://articles.latimes.com/2009/mar/31/world/fg-china-timezone31/2|title=Clocks square off in China's far west|first=Barbara|last=Demick|date=31 March 2009|via=LA Times|access-date=14 December 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121217031320/http://articles.latimes.com/2009/mar/31/world/fg-china-timezone31/2|archive-date=17 December 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Deserts ===\nDeserts include:\n* [[Gurbant\u00fcngg\u00fct Desert]], also known as ''Dzoosotoyn Elisen''\n* [[Taklamakan Desert]]\n* [[Kumtag Desert]], east of Taklamakan\n\n=== Major cities ===\nDue to the water situation, most of Xinjiang's population lives within fairly narrow belts that are stretched along the foothills of the region's mountain ranges, where irrigated agriculture can be practised.

According to the Asia-Pacific Center for Security Studies, the two main sources for [[separatism]] in the Xinjiang Province are religion and ethnicity. Religiously, the Uyghur peoples of Xinjiang follow [[Islam]], while in the large cities of Han China, the primary religions practiced are [[Buddhism]], [[Confucianism]], [[Taoism]] or a combination of them. The other major difference and source of friction with eastern China is ethnicity. The Uyghurs are ethnically, linguistically, and culturally Turkic, a clear distinction from the Han and other ethnicities that are the majority in the eastern regions of China. Hence, there is a noticeable voice of ethnic Uyghurs who would like to separate their region from China.

The two singer/songwriters continued their collaboration after Madder Rose disbanded, Cot\u00e9 as guitarist and producer on Lorson's three album with [[Saint Low]], Lorson as guest vocalist on Cot\u00e9's Jazz Cannon album. Lorson and Cot\u00e9 have also created the original scores to several films, notably HBO's documentary ''[[What Remains: The Life and Work of Sally Mann]]'', and in 2008, they released an album with Kathy Ziegler as The Piano Creeps. The name Madder Rose came from the herb-based paint [[rose madder]]. Many of their songs, including \"Panic On\" and \"Car Song\", were featured in [[John Peel]]'s end-of-year round-up, the [[Festive Fifty]], major feature films, and television shows. The band released three albums on [[Atlantic Records]], and one on [[Cooking Vinyl]], before breaking up in 1999.\n\n==History==\nThe band was formed in 1991 in a [[Greenwich Village]] apartment, after Billy Cot\u00e9, the band's songwriter, was informed by a mutual friend that a woman named Mary Lorson was looking for a project.<ref name=Deseret/> They released their debut album ''[[Bring It Down]]'' in 1993 on Atlantic Records' quasi-independent label [[Seed Records]], followed by the ''Swim'' EP later that year on the same label.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.trouserpress.com/entry.php?a=madder_rose | title=Madder Rose | work=[[Trouser Press]] | accessdate=24 March 2014 |author1=Testa, Jim |author2=Sprague, David }}</ref> Originally, Atlantic had asked to sign them, but Lorson turned them down.

This was followed, under the name Mary Larson & Saint Low, by ''Tricks for Dawn'' (2002) and ''Realistic'' (2006). 2011 saw the release of ''Burn Baby Burn'' under the name Mary B. Lorson & The Soubrettes.\n\nCot\u00e9 released the album ''Amateur Soul Surgery'' in 2000, and two 12\" singles as The Jazz Cannon with vocalist Don Greene, which also feature vocal contributions from Lorson. Cot\u00e9 subsequently released an album with vocalist/songwriter Uniit Carruyo under the name Glen the Owl (also featuring vocal contributions from Lorson) which, like the early Madder Rose releases, featured sleeve art by Cot\u00e9.\n\nCot\u00e9 and Lorson together released a largely instrumental album ''Piano Creeps'' under their own names on Cooking Vinyl in 2003. Cot\u00e9, Lorson, and multi-instrumentalist Kathy Zeigler then released an album as The Piano Creeps in 2008, called ''Future Blues (For Me and You)'', on The Kora Records.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.thekorarecords.com/artists/the-piano-creeps/ | title=The Piano Creeps | publisher=Kora Records | accessdate=24 March 2014}}</ref>\n\nCurrently, Billy Cot\u00e9 works occasionally with Johnny Dowd.

The two singer/songwriters continued their collaboration after Madder Rose disbanded, Cot\u00e9 as guitarist and producer on Lorson's three album with [[Saint Low]], Lorson as guest vocalist on Cot\u00e9's Jazz Cannon album. Lorson and Cot\u00e9 have also created the original scores to several films, notably HBO's documentary ''[[What Remains: The Life and Work of Sally Mann]]'', and in 2008, they released an album with Kathy Ziegler as The Piano Creeps. The name Madder Rose came from the herb-based paint [[rose madder]]. Many of their songs, including \"Panic On\" and \"Car Song\", were featured in [[John Peel]]'s end-of-year round-up, the [[Festive Fifty]], major feature films, and television shows. The band released three albums on [[Atlantic Records]], and one on [[Cooking Vinyl]], before breaking up in 1999.\n\n==History==\nThe band was formed in 1991 in a [[Greenwich Village]] apartment, after Billy Cot\u00e9, the band's songwriter, was informed by a mutual friend that a woman named Mary Lorson was looking for a project.<ref name=Deseret/> They released their debut album ''[[Bring It Down]]'' in 1993 on Atlantic Records' quasi-independent label [[Seed Records]], followed by the ''Swim'' EP later that year on the same label.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.trouserpress.com/entry.php?a=madder_rose | title=Madder Rose | work=[[Trouser Press]] | accessdate=24 March 2014 |author1=Testa, Jim |author2=Sprague, David }}</ref> Originally, Atlantic had asked to sign them, but Lorson turned them down.

He is now considered one of the most successful fashion photographers in the industry, shooting regularly for both US and Italian ''Vogue'', and lately ''[[W (magazine)|W]]'' (also published by [[Cond\u00e9 Nast Publications|Cond\u00e9 Nast]]) and British ''Vogue''.\n\n==Early life==\n\n\nMeisel studied at the [[High School of Art and Design]] and [[Parsons The New School for Design]] where he attended different courses but, as affirmed in an interview with [[Ingrid Sischy]] for ''Vogue'' France, he finally majored in fashion illustration.\n\n==Career==\nOne of Meisel's first jobs was to work for fashion designer [[Halston]] as an illustrator. He also taught illustration part-time at [[Parsons The New School for Design|Parsons]]. Meisel never thought he could become a photographer. He admired photographers like [[Jerry Schatzberg]], [[Irving Penn]], [[Richard Avedon]] and [[Bert Stern]]. He felt that illustration was a thing of the past and found photography as a lasting medium. Later on, while working at ''[[Women's Wear Daily]]'' as an illustrator, he went to [[Elite Model Management]] where Oscar Reyes, a booker who liked his illustrations, allowed him take pictures of some of their models. He would photograph them in his apartment in [[Gramercy Park]] or on the street: on weekdays he would work at ''Women's Wear Daily'' and on weekends with the models. One of them was [[Phoebe Cates]]. Some of these models went to castings for ''[[Seventeen (American magazine)|Seventeen]]'' magazine to show their portfolios which held some of his photography and the people at ''Seventeen'' subsequently called Meisel and asked if he wanted to work with them.\n\nMeisel currently works for many different fashion magazines, most notably [[Interview (magazine)|Interview]] and US and Italian ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]''.\n\nMeisel has contributed photos for the covers of several popular albums and singles, including two RIAA Diamond-certified albums, [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]'s 1984 album \"[[Like a Virgin (album)|Like a Virgin]]\" and [[Mariah Carey]]'s 1995 album ''[[Daydream (Mariah Carey album)|Daydream]]''. His work also can be seen on the cover of Madonna's single \"[[Bad Girl (Madonna song)|Bad Girl]]\" (a nude), the limited picture disc for Madonna's UK single release of \"[[Fever (Madonna song)|Fever]]\" (a partial nude), and [[Mariah Carey]]'s single \"[[Fantasy (Mariah Carey song)|Fantasy]]\" (simply a different crop of the photo on the cover of the ''[[Daydream (Mariah Carey album)|Daydream]]'' album).\n\n===Fashion campaigns===\nAmongst others, Meisel has shot campaigns for [[Gianni Versace S.p.A.|Versace]], [[Valentino SpA|Valentino]], [[Dolce & Gabbana]], Louis Vuitton, Balenciaga and [[Calvin Klein]] (his campaigns for whom were very controversial).\nMeisel also shoots [[Prada]] campaigns each season \u2014 having done so since 2004. In April 2008 he shot friend [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] for ''Vanity Fair'', and later in the year he shot her for the 2009 spring campaign by [[Louis Vuitton]].\n\nHe is a close friend of designer [[Anna Sui]] for whom he also shot several campaigns, even though Sui rarely uses advertising to promote her clothing.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ellahoy.es/moda/articulo/los-mejores-fotografos-de-moda-de-la-historia/270111/ |title=Los mejores fot\u00f3grafos de moda de la historia |last=Maura |first=Susana |date=January 1, 2017 |website=ellahoy.es |publisher=Ella Hoy |access-date=January 17, 2017 |language=Spanish |trans-title=The Best Photographers in the History of Fashion}}</ref>\n\n===Influence===\nAs one of the most powerful photographers in the fashion industry, Meisel is credited with \"discovering\" or promoting the careers of many successful models, including [[Linda Evangelista]], [[Guinevere Van Seenus]], [[Karen Elson]], [[Meghan Collison]], [[Amber Valletta]], [[Kristen McMenamy]], [[Stella Tennant]], [[Raquel Zimmerman]], [[Sasha Pivovarova]], [[Naomi Campbell]], [[Christy Turlington]], [[Gisele B\u00fcndchen]], [[Caroline Trentini]], [[Karlie Kloss]], [[Jourdan Dunn]], [[Joan Smalls]], [[Iris Strubegger]], [[Lindsey Wixson]], [[Lara Stone]], [[Coco Rocha]], [[Natalia Vodianova]], [[Vanessa Axente]], and [[Elise Crombez]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://runway.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/04/22/meisel-and-his-muses/?_r=0|title=Meisel and His Muses|accessdate=April 22, 2009}}</ref> propelling them to fame by regularly featuring them in ''Vogue'' and various campaigns.

For example, in the September 2006 issue of ''Vogue Italia''', Meisel played with the concept of restricted liberties post-September 11 America, with the models portraying terrorists and highly trained policemen. It caused a stir in the press, as the models were presented in violent compositions where they could be seen as being victimized. It also elicited a negative response from feminists which saw the role of the women as being undermined by their male counterparts. The July 2008 issue of ''Vogue Italia'' featured only black models, and was entirely photographed by Meisel. It was a response to increasing criticism of racism in the fashion industry and became the best-selling issue in the magazine's history. When asked about the issue, Meisel said, \"Obviously I feel that fashion is totally racist. The one thing that taking pictures allows you to do is occasionally make a larger statement. After seeing all the shows though I feel it was totally ineffective. I was curious\u2014because it received a lot of publicity\u2014whether it would have any effect on New York, London, Paris, or Milan, and I found that it did not. They still only had one token black girl, maybe two.

When asked about the issue, Meisel said, \"Obviously I feel that fashion is totally racist. The one thing that taking pictures allows you to do is occasionally make a larger statement. After seeing all the shows though I feel it was totally ineffective. I was curious\u2014because it received a lot of publicity\u2014whether it would have any effect on New York, London, Paris, or Milan, and I found that it did not. They still only had one token black girl, maybe two. It\u2019s the same as it always was and that\u2019s the sad thing for me.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://032c.com/2008/who-is-steven-meisel/|title=Who Is Steven Meisel?|accessdate=December 13, 2013|publisher=032c}}</ref>\n\nArtist Rep agency Art + Commerce represents Steven Meisel for image licensing and advertising.<ref>http://www.artandcommerce.com/aac/C.aspx?VP=Mod_StaticPage.StaticPage_VPage&SP=home&HN=T</ref>\n\n===Private life===\n\nMeisel is notorious for rarely giving interviews or being photographed.
