Mountains and cliffs fill the background, and the sky is blue, filled with clouds. Hovering over the scene is the Minecraft logo.\n}}\n\n'''''Minecraft''''' is a [[sandbox video game]] developed by [[Mojang]]. ''Minecraft'' was created by [[Markus \"Notch\" Persson]] in the [[Java programming language]] and was released as a [[public alpha]] for personal computers in 2009 before officially releasing in November 2011, with [[Jens Bergensten]] taking over development around then. It has since been ported to various platforms and is the [[bestselling video game of all time]], with over 180 million copies sold across all platforms and over 112 million monthly active players by 2019.\n\nIn ''Minecraft'', players explore a blocky, [[procedurally-generated]] [[3D computer graphics|3D]] world, and may discover and extract raw materials, [[Crafting (gaming)|craft]] tools, build structures or [[Earthworks (engineering)|earthworks]], and depending on [[game mode]], can fight computer-controlled [[Mob (gaming)|\"mobs\"]], as well as either cooperate with or compete against other players in the same world. These modes include a [[survival mode]], in which players must acquire resources to build the world and maintain health, and a creative mode, where players have unlimited resources. Players can [[Minecraft mods|modify the game]] to create new gameplay mechanics, items, and assets.\n\n''Minecraft'' has been critically acclaimed, winning several awards and being cited of the most influential and [[greatest video games of all time]]. Social media, parodies, adaptations, merchandise, and the annual [[MineCon]] conventions played large roles in popularizing the game. It has also been used in educational environments, especially in the realm of computing systems, as virtual computers and hardware devices have been built in it. In 2014, Mojang and the ''Minecraft'' [[intellectual property]] were purchased by [[Microsoft]] for {{US$|2.5 billion}}. A number of spin-off games have also been produced, such as ''[[Minecraft: Story Mode]]'', ''[[Minecraft Dungeons]]'', and ''[[Minecraft Earth]]''.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n''Minecraft'' is a [[3D computer graphics|3D]] [[sandbox game]] that has no specific goals to accomplish, allowing players a large amount of freedom in choosing how to play the game.<ref name=\"IGN review\">{{cite web |url=https://uk.ign.com/articles/2011/11/24/minecraft-review |title=Minecraft Review&nbsp;\u2014 PC Review at IGN |website=[[IGN]] |accessdate=18 December 2011 |first=Anthony |last=Gallegos |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151106165908/http://uk.ign.com/articles/2011/11/24/minecraft-review |archivedate=6 November 2015 |date=23 November 2011}}</ref> However, there is an [[Achievement (video gaming)|achievement]] system,<ref>{{cite web |last=Meer |first=Alec |title=Minecraft:Wolves, Achievements, Mods, Merch |url=http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2011/03/30/minecraft-mods/ |publisher=Rock, Paper, Shotgun, Ltd. |website=[[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]] |date=30 March 2011 |accessdate=26 March 2015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402093516/http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2011/03/30/minecraft-mods/ |archivedate=2 April 2015}}</ref> known as \"advancements\" in the ''Java Edition'' of the game.

Using ''Minecraft'', the community has helped reconstruct the areas of concern, and citizens are invited to enter the ''Minecraft'' servers and modify their own neighborhood. Carl Manneh, Mojang's managing director, called the game \"the perfect tool to facilitate this process\", adding \"The three-year partnership will support UN-Habitat's [[The Sustainable Urban Development Network (SUD-Net)|Sustainable Urban Development Network]] to upgrade 300 public spaces by 2016.\" Mojang signed ''Minecraft'' building community, ''FyreUK'', to help render the environments into ''Minecraft''. The first pilot project began in [[Kibera]], one of [[Nairobi]]'s informal settlements, and is in the planning phase. The ''Block By Block'' project is based on an earlier initiative started in October 2011, ''Mina Kvarter'' (My Block), which gave young people in Swedish communities a tool to visualize how they wanted to change their part of town. According to Manneh, the project was a helpful way to visualize urban planning ideas without necessarily having a training in architecture. The ideas presented by the citizens were a template for political decisions.<ref name=\"blockbyblock\">{{cite web |url=http://www.pcgamer.com/2012/09/05/minecraft-un-block-by-block-project-to-help-young-people-redesign-their-neighbourhoods/ |title=Minecraft UN Block By Block project to help young people redesign their neighbourhoods |magazine=[[PC Gamer]] |publisher=[[Future plc]] |date=5 September 2012 |accessdate=5 September 2012 |first=Tom |last=Senior |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120907235734/http://www.pcgamer.com/2012/09/05/minecraft-un-block-by-block-project-to-help-young-people-redesign-their-neighbourhoods/ |archivedate=7 September 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn April 2014, the [[Danish Geodata Agency]] generated all of Denmark in fullscale in ''Minecraft'' based on their own geodata.<ref name=\"DenmarkInMinecraft\">{{cite press release |url=http://gst.dk/nyheder/nyhedsarkiv/2014/apr/geodatastyrelsen-giver-de-unge-hele-danmark-i-3d/ |title=Geodatastyrelsen giver de unge hele Danmark i 3D |trans-title=The Geodata Agency gives the youth whole Denmark in 3D |publisher=The Danish Geodata Agency |date=24 April 2014 |accessdate=25 April 2014 |language=Danish |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140426235902/http://gst.dk/nyheder/nyhedsarkiv/2014/apr/geodatastyrelsen-giver-de-unge-hele-danmark-i-3d/ |archivedate=26 April 2014}}</ref> This is possible because Denmark is [[List of elevation extremes by country|one of the flattest countries]] with the highest point at {{convert|171|m|||}} (ranking as the country with the [[List of elevation extremes by country|30th smallest elevation span]]), where the limit in default ''Minecraft'' is around {{convert|192|m|||}} above in-game sea level.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n''Minecraft'' has also been used in educational settings.<ref name=\"Education\">{{cite web |url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/minecraft-in-education-how-video-games-are-teaching-kids/1100-6400549/ |title=Minecraft In Education: How Video Games Are Teaching Kids |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |website=[[GameSpot]] |date=25 November 2012 |accessdate=9 December 2012 |last=Walton |first=Mark |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131010082122/http://www.gamespot.com/articles/minecraft-in-education-how-video-games-are-teaching-kids/1100-6400549/ |archivedate=10 October 2013}}</ref> In 2011, an educational organization named MinecraftEdu was formed with the goal of introducing ''Minecraft'' into schools.

''Minecraft'' was created by [[Markus \"Notch\" Persson]] in the [[Java programming language]] and was released as a [[public alpha]] for personal computers in 2009 before officially releasing in November 2011, with [[Jens Bergensten]] taking over development around then. It has since been ported to various platforms and is the [[bestselling video game of all time]], with over 180 million copies sold across all platforms and over 112 million monthly active players by 2019.\n\nIn ''Minecraft'', players explore a blocky, [[procedurally-generated]] [[3D computer graphics|3D]] world, and may discover and extract raw materials, [[Crafting (gaming)|craft]] tools, build structures or [[Earthworks (engineering)|earthworks]], and depending on [[game mode]], can fight computer-controlled [[Mob (gaming)|\"mobs\"]], as well as either cooperate with or compete against other players in the same world. These modes include a [[survival mode]], in which players must acquire resources to build the world and maintain health, and a creative mode, where players have unlimited resources. Players can [[Minecraft mods|modify the game]] to create new gameplay mechanics, items, and assets.\n\n''Minecraft'' has been critically acclaimed, winning several awards and being cited of the most influential and [[greatest video games of all time]]. Social media, parodies, adaptations, merchandise, and the annual [[MineCon]] conventions played large roles in popularizing the game. It has also been used in educational environments, especially in the realm of computing systems, as virtual computers and hardware devices have been built in it. In 2014, Mojang and the ''Minecraft'' [[intellectual property]] were purchased by [[Microsoft]] for {{US$|2.5 billion}}. A number of spin-off games have also been produced, such as ''[[Minecraft: Story Mode]]'', ''[[Minecraft Dungeons]]'', and ''[[Minecraft Earth]]''.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n''Minecraft'' is a [[3D computer graphics|3D]] [[sandbox game]] that has no specific goals to accomplish, allowing players a large amount of freedom in choosing how to play the game.<ref name=\"IGN review\">{{cite web |url=https://uk.ign.com/articles/2011/11/24/minecraft-review |title=Minecraft Review&nbsp;\u2014 PC Review at IGN |website=[[IGN]] |accessdate=18 December 2011 |first=Anthony |last=Gallegos |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151106165908/http://uk.ign.com/articles/2011/11/24/minecraft-review |archivedate=6 November 2015 |date=23 November 2011}}</ref> However, there is an [[Achievement (video gaming)|achievement]] system,<ref>{{cite web |last=Meer |first=Alec |title=Minecraft:Wolves, Achievements, Mods, Merch |url=http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2011/03/30/minecraft-mods/ |publisher=Rock, Paper, Shotgun, Ltd. |website=[[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]] |date=30 March 2011 |accessdate=26 March 2015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402093516/http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2011/03/30/minecraft-mods/ |archivedate=2 April 2015}}</ref> known as \"advancements\" in the ''Java Edition'' of the game.

Using ''Minecraft'', the community has helped reconstruct the areas of concern, and citizens are invited to enter the ''Minecraft'' servers and modify their own neighborhood. Carl Manneh, Mojang's managing director, called the game \"the perfect tool to facilitate this process\", adding \"The three-year partnership will support UN-Habitat's [[The Sustainable Urban Development Network (SUD-Net)|Sustainable Urban Development Network]] to upgrade 300 public spaces by 2016.\" Mojang signed ''Minecraft'' building community, ''FyreUK'', to help render the environments into ''Minecraft''. The first pilot project began in [[Kibera]], one of [[Nairobi]]'s informal settlements, and is in the planning phase. The ''Block By Block'' project is based on an earlier initiative started in October 2011, ''Mina Kvarter'' (My Block), which gave young people in Swedish communities a tool to visualize how they wanted to change their part of town.

{"title_page": "Jan Pouwer", "text_new": "{{cleanup|date=February 2011}}\n\n'''Jan Pouwer''' (21 September 1924, [[Dordrecht]] \u2013 21 April 2010, [[Zwolle]]) was a [[Dutch people|Dutch]] [[anthropologist]] with a thorough grounding in his profession in terms of fieldwork and theory. He studied Indology and Ethnology at [[Leiden University]] (MA 1950, PhD 1955) under the renowned [[J.P.B. de Josselin de Jong|Jan Petrus Benjamin de Josselin de Jong]]. He worked as a \u2018government anthropologist\u2019 and conducted extensive fieldwork in [[Netherlands New Guinea]] (now [[West Papua (region)|West Papua]]), 1951-62. He subsequently served as Professor of Anthropology at [[University of Amsterdam|Amsterdam]], [[Victoria University of Wellington|Wellington (N.Z./Aotearoa)]] and [[Radboud University Nijmegen|Nijmegen Universities]], 1962-87.\n\nMany of his concerns and much of his work can be viewed as a 'text' framed within the 'context' of Leiden Structuralism, itself part of the larger field of modern anthropology. He enriched this field with insights in configurational comparison and the dialectical character of social structure, mythology, gender and ritual. A dedicated teacher, Pouwer's ideas are not to be found in a single volume. They exist, like some forms of mythology, in several outlines and sketches. Over the course of his career, Pouwer published two books (one his 1955 PhD thesis) and a wide range of articles. His last book, ''Gender, Ritual and Social Formation in West Papua: A Configurational Analysis Comparing Kamoro and Asmat'', was published at Leiden in 2010. It can be downloaded from OAPEN for no cost.\n\n==Professional career==\n\nPouwer studied Indology and Ethnology at Leiden University (first degree July 1, 1947; second degree November 14, 1950), a study leading to an academic degree for the Netherlands Indies Public Administration that included: Malayan and Javanese languages, Comparative Ethnology of the Netherlands Indies, Islamic Institutions, Overseas History, Constitutional and Customary Law, Western and Non-Western Economics, Cultural Anthropology. He worked briefly as a lecturer at Utrecht University (1951), then took off on a career as a \u2018government anthropologist\u2019 in Netherlands New Guinea, 1951-62.\n\nHe obtained his PhD on anthropological fieldwork among the Mimika in the Netherlands New Guinea at Leiden in 1955. He was a research officer (gouvernmentsethnoloog) at the Bureau for Native Affairs (Kantoor voor Bevolkingszaken) in Hollandia (now [[Jayapura]]), Netherlands New Guinea, 1951\u201360; served as Acting Advisor for Native Affairs in 1960-1961, as Advisor for Native Affairs in 1962.\n\nHe conducted fieldwork among the Kamoro people in the coastal Mimika-area (South-West New Guinea), 1951\u201354; undertook a two-months\u2019 survey on social structure, land-tenure, prestige economy and some moot problems of acculturation in the areas surrounding the Ajamaru lakes, Central Bird\u2019s Head, West New Guinea, 1956; six months of research into the effects of commercial films on the ideas, values and behavior of urban Papuans, 1956; four months of fieldwork in the rugged highlands of the Northwestern Bird\u2019s Head (Anggi lakes and surroundings), mainly among two highly dispersed tribes, 1957; eight months of fieldwork as a member of the Dutch scientific expedition to the Star Mountains (Sterrengebergte) near the border between West New Guinea and [[Papua (province)|Papua]], 1959; the Iwur region, south of the Star Mountains; the urban community of Tugunese people (1961), a mixture of Indonesian, Portuguese, Dutch, German and Papuan origin, who left their village near Jakarta in 1950 to settle in Hollandia (now Jayapura) and who were expected to migrate to the Netherlands in 1962.\n\nHis 1955 PhD thesis at Leiden, ''Enkele aspecten van de Mimika-cultuur, Nederlands Zuidwest Nieuw Guinea'' (Some aspects of Mimika Culture, Netherlands South-West New Guinea), was based on twenty-five months of fieldwork among the Mimika (Kamoro) people. Pouwer makes frequent reference to it in many of his published papers. In the Prologue to his 2010 book, he notes (2010:3) that a request to have the thesis translated into English was unsuccessful and that this reduced access for those with a limited reading knowledge of Dutch.\n\nShortly before his death, Pouwer concluded a synthetic monograph comparing Kamoro and Asmat culture, based on his own fieldwork, missionary and administrative reports, and anthropological studies (''Gender, Ritual and Social Formation in West Papua''. Leiden, 2010). In this work Pouwer makes use of a distinction between the symbolic and existential dimensions of social action as refined by Bruce Knauft (1993) while, at the same time and contra Knauft, using a configurational approach to demonstrate the difference between the neighbouring Kamoro and Asmat peoples.\n\nTeaching experience: as part of his official duties Pouwer taught general anthropology and ethnography of New Guinea at the School of Public Administration (Bestuursschool) in Hollandia, Netherlands New Guinea, 1955-58. He was Full Professor of Cultural Anthropology, Faculty of Social and Political Sciences, [[University of Amsterdam]], The Netherlands, 1962\u201366; Foundation Professor and Head of the Department of Anthropology and Maori Studies, [[Victoria University of Wellington]], New Zealand, 1966\u201376; and Senior Lecturer, Department of Cultural and Social Anthropology, [[Catholic University of Nijmegen]], The Netherlands, 1976-87. He was a Visiting Professor at Monash University (Australia) in 1971 and at the Universities of Toronto (Canada), Leiden and Utrecht (the Netherlands) in 1972.\n\n===General Overview===\n\nOne theme which runs through Pouwer's work, both published and unpublished, is the need for new approaches to understanding the social formations of other peoples. In his work he was always aware of a dialectical relationship, in terms of systems of significations, between the anthropologist as an observer and the lived realities of other peoples.\n\nThere was never any easy resting place for dogma in Pouwer's teaching. He not only embraced paradox and contradiction as necessary features of knowledge, he also emphasized the ongoing dialectical movement from doubt to certainty to doubt ...\n\nHis New Guinea experiences lead him to seriously question the use of descent-based anthropological models developed in Africa. Characterising descent as a vertical form of arrangement, Pouwer noted that \"... the structural importance of the horizontal arrangement of kin has been neglected.\" (Pouwer 1967:92) He added that, without taking \"...the horizontal arrangement into explicit consideration ... the structure of New Guinea systems will not be intelligible to us.\"(ibid)\n\nPouwer's work also demonstrates a consistent attempt to capture, within a strict discipline, something of life's movement. This tension in his work may have resulted from his immersion in New Guinea lived realities and the lack of fit between those realities and Western understanding. Possibly for this reason Pouwer did not embrace a purely structuralist position ''\u00e0 la L\u00e9vi-Strauss''.\n\nPouwer was a foremost advocate of a configurational approach for cross-cultural comparison with an emphasis on the importance of 'relative position' of elements within an arrangement rather than on elements themselves. Pouwer's configurational approach has a synchronic aspect (comparison between cultures) and a diachronic aspect which (following L\u00e9vi-Strauss) he called 'structural history'.\n\nThe configurational approach to cross-cultural comparison may also be viewed against other attempts such as those of [[structural functionalism]], which dealt with institutions and functions.<ref>For example, the comparative functionalism of Walter Goldschmidt.</ref>\n\nSome of the other themes which ran through his teaching (during his years in Wellington, New Zealand-Aotearoa) do not appear strongly in his published work. These include an emphasis on complementary opposition and a both-and approach (in comparison to an either/or logic).\n\nOther themes range from a review of Dutch New Guinea as an Ethnological Field of Study (1961) to a 'travel guide' to the myths of Kamoro and Asmat peoples (2002). In the latter, Pouwer brings an anthropological perspective spanning some fifty years to materials collected by others including Dutch missionaries such as Father G. A. Zegwaard.\n\n===Field of Study===\n\nPouwer's deep concern with questions regarding cross-cultural comparison (and avoiding the comparison of incomparables) was related to the Leiden School's tradition as well as to the theoretical problems of general anthropology. The role played by J.P.B. de Josselin de Jong's idea of  \"Field of Ethnological Study\"  (later, under P.E. de Josselin de Jong,  \"Field of Anthropological Study\" FAS) leads to questions of how to compare and contrast different socio-cultural formations within an area deemed to constitute a field of study. In place of typologies of cultures or simple comparison of 'elements' Pouwer asserted that a concern for 'relative position' of elements is a fundamental structuralist tenet.\n\nPouwer's work demonstrated a Leiden FAS concern for socio-cosmic aspects including dualism and First Peoples' (indigenous) cosmology. He wrote about New Guinea as a field of ethnographic study in 1961 and revisited the topic in 1992.\n\n===Configurational Approach===\n\nIn addition to his 1960s article on a configurational approach, Pouwer spelled out more of his understanding of configurations in 1974. There Pouwer put forward structuring principles which can \"...form a system of relations, a configuration ...\". These include two complementary ''basic'' structuring principles: (a) Identical positioning, and (b) Contra-positioning. There are three ''derived general'' structuring principles: (c) Reciprocal positioning, (d) Equi-positioning, (e) Supra-positioning. To these are added the ''derived particular'' structuring principles: (f) vertical positioning, (g) Horizontal positioning, and (h) Concentric positioning. (Pouwer 1974:241-242)\n\nIn his 2010 book Pouwer said:\n\n\"By 'configuration' I mean a process that turns elements into components arranged and imbued with meaning by a central orientation...Both configuration and orientation can be conceived of as always being on the move, never closed, always open to change, ambivalence and contradiction. A configuration approach assumes a central orientation that permeates a particular society and culture.\" (Pouwer 2010:7-8)<ref>Reimar Schefold 1994:805 on configurational comparisons in relation to FAS.</ref>\n\n===Descent versus Siblingship ===\n\nPouwer's fieldwork in [[New Guinea]] caused him to question the privileged position within modern anthropology given to the notion of 'descent'. He found that there were cases where siblingship was more important in New Guinean people's lives than 'descent'. It is clear from his writings that his fieldwork experiences led him to look for other ways of properly characterising his ethnographic data. Casting various forms of  'descent' as  modalities of 'vertical' arrangement (as derived from general structuring principles), he sought to accommodate the 'horizontal' relationships found in New Guinean social life.  In his 1974 article he was able to conclude that \"The narrow and often shaky criterion of descent is no longer useful or required, nor is it logically defensible. It can be superseded by the criteria of vertical and horizontal arrangement ...\" (Pouwer, 1974:251-252)\n\n===Structuralism and Semiotics===\n\nPouwer's intellectual approach to social structure followed that of [[Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss]] and stood in contrast to the naive empiricism of Radcliffe-Brown. Pouwer, in keeping with a sense of 'becoming' imminent in life, also developed the notion of 'structuration'.\n\nIt is noticeable in his later work that Pouwer does not follow [[L\u00e9vi-Strauss]] into a structuralist analysis of myth and ritual. In his 1975 article he distances himself from an examination of paradigmatic relations at the expense of syntagmatic movements. Pouwer pays homage in that work to a \"Holy Trinity\" of three levels of articulation: 1. symbolic (relationship between signifier and signified), 2. paradigmatic (relationship of one sign to another in its relative position to other signs in a system (limited)), 3. syntagmatic (chain of signs projected in a particular space, time and discourse (unlimited)). All three levels are to be respected.\n\n\"The paramount postulate is that things and events should be studied as if they were signs. The thing-analogy, a tacit postulate of so many studies of social facts and initiated by Durkheim, should be abandoned.\" (Pouwer 1975:97)\n\n===Structural History===\n\nPouwer did not accept a division of labour between history and anthropology, although his history was one of configurations of structuring principles.\n\n\"... the history of the succession of varying configurations of structuring principles in their dialectical interaction with the stream of signified events, has barely begun ...\" (Pouwer 1974:253)\n\n===Reciprocity===\n\nReciprocity formed a chapter of Pouwer's PhD thesis (1955:161-211).

He studied Indology and Ethnology at [[Leiden University]] (MA 1950, PhD 1955) under the renowned [[J.P.B. de Josselin de Jong|Jan Petrus Benjamin de Josselin de Jong]]. He worked as a \u2018government anthropologist\u2019 and conducted extensive fieldwork in [[Netherlands New Guinea]] (now [[West Papua (region)|West Papua]]), 1951-62. He subsequently served as Professor of Anthropology at [[University of Amsterdam|Amsterdam]], [[Victoria University of Wellington|Wellington (N.Z./Aotearoa)]] and [[Radboud University Nijmegen|Nijmegen Universities]], 1962-87.\n\nMany of his concerns and much of his work can be viewed as a 'text' framed within the 'context' of Leiden Structuralism, itself part of the larger field of modern anthropology. He enriched this field with insights in configurational comparison and the dialectical character of social structure, mythology, gender and ritual. A dedicated teacher, Pouwer's ideas are not to be found in a single volume. They exist, like some forms of mythology, in several outlines and sketches. Over the course of his career, Pouwer published two books (one his 1955 PhD thesis) and a wide range of articles. His last book, ''Gender, Ritual and Social Formation in West Papua: A Configurational Analysis Comparing Kamoro and Asmat'', was published at Leiden in 2010. It can be downloaded from OAPEN for no cost.\n\n==Professional career==\n\nPouwer studied Indology and Ethnology at Leiden University (first degree July 1, 1947; second degree November 14, 1950), a study leading to an academic degree for the Netherlands Indies Public Administration that included: Malayan and Javanese languages, Comparative Ethnology of the Netherlands Indies, Islamic Institutions, Overseas History, Constitutional and Customary Law, Western and Non-Western Economics, Cultural Anthropology. He worked briefly as a lecturer at Utrecht University (1951), then took off on a career as a \u2018government anthropologist\u2019 in Netherlands New Guinea, 1951-62.\n\nHe obtained his PhD on anthropological fieldwork among the Mimika in the Netherlands New Guinea at Leiden in 1955. He was a research officer (gouvernmentsethnoloog) at the Bureau for Native Affairs (Kantoor voor Bevolkingszaken) in Hollandia (now [[Jayapura]]), Netherlands New Guinea, 1951\u201360; served as Acting Advisor for Native Affairs in 1960-1961, as Advisor for Native Affairs in 1962.\n\nHe conducted fieldwork among the Kamoro people in the coastal Mimika-area (South-West New Guinea), 1951\u201354; undertook a two-months\u2019 survey on social structure, land-tenure, prestige economy and some moot problems of acculturation in the areas surrounding the Ajamaru lakes, Central Bird\u2019s Head, West New Guinea, 1956; six months of research into the effects of commercial films on the ideas, values and behavior of urban Papuans, 1956; four months of fieldwork in the rugged highlands of the Northwestern Bird\u2019s Head (Anggi lakes and surroundings), mainly among two highly dispersed tribes, 1957; eight months of fieldwork as a member of the Dutch scientific expedition to the Star Mountains (Sterrengebergte) near the border between West New Guinea and [[Papua (province)|Papua]], 1959; the Iwur region, south of the Star Mountains; the urban community of Tugunese people (1961), a mixture of Indonesian, Portuguese, Dutch, German and Papuan origin, who left their village near Jakarta in 1950 to settle in Hollandia (now Jayapura) and who were expected to migrate to the Netherlands in 1962.\n\nHis 1955 PhD thesis at Leiden, ''Enkele aspecten van de Mimika-cultuur, Nederlands Zuidwest Nieuw Guinea'' (Some aspects of Mimika Culture, Netherlands South-West New Guinea), was based on twenty-five months of fieldwork among the Mimika (Kamoro) people. Pouwer makes frequent reference to it in many of his published papers. In the Prologue to his 2010 book, he notes (2010:3) that a request to have the thesis translated into English was unsuccessful and that this reduced access for those with a limited reading knowledge of Dutch.\n\nShortly before his death, Pouwer concluded a synthetic monograph comparing Kamoro and Asmat culture, based on his own fieldwork, missionary and administrative reports, and anthropological studies (''Gender, Ritual and Social Formation in West Papua''. Leiden, 2010). In this work Pouwer makes use of a distinction between the symbolic and existential dimensions of social action as refined by Bruce Knauft (1993) while, at the same time and contra Knauft, using a configurational approach to demonstrate the difference between the neighbouring Kamoro and Asmat peoples.\n\nTeaching experience: as part of his official duties Pouwer taught general anthropology and ethnography of New Guinea at the School of Public Administration (Bestuursschool) in Hollandia, Netherlands New Guinea, 1955-58. He was Full Professor of Cultural Anthropology, Faculty of Social and Political Sciences, [[University of Amsterdam]], The Netherlands, 1962\u201366; Foundation Professor and Head of the Department of Anthropology and Maori Studies, [[Victoria University of Wellington]], New Zealand, 1966\u201376; and Senior Lecturer, Department of Cultural and Social Anthropology, [[Catholic University of Nijmegen]], The Netherlands, 1976-87. He was a Visiting Professor at Monash University (Australia) in 1971 and at the Universities of Toronto (Canada), Leiden and Utrecht (the Netherlands) in 1972.\n\n===General Overview===\n\nOne theme which runs through Pouwer's work, both published and unpublished, is the need for new approaches to understanding the social formations of other peoples. In his work he was always aware of a dialectical relationship, in terms of systems of significations, between the anthropologist as an observer and the lived realities of other peoples.\n\nThere was never any easy resting place for dogma in Pouwer's teaching. He not only embraced paradox and contradiction as necessary features of knowledge, he also emphasized the ongoing dialectical movement from doubt to certainty to doubt ...\n\nHis New Guinea experiences lead him to seriously question the use of descent-based anthropological models developed in Africa. Characterising descent as a vertical form of arrangement, Pouwer noted that \"... the structural importance of the horizontal arrangement of kin has been neglected.\" (Pouwer 1967:92) He added that, without taking \"...the horizontal arrangement into explicit consideration ... the structure of New Guinea systems will not be intelligible to us.\"(ibid)\n\nPouwer's work also demonstrates a consistent attempt to capture, within a strict discipline, something of life's movement. This tension in his work may have resulted from his immersion in New Guinea lived realities and the lack of fit between those realities and Western understanding. Possibly for this reason Pouwer did not embrace a purely structuralist position ''\u00e0 la L\u00e9vi-Strauss''.\n\nPouwer was a foremost advocate of a configurational approach for cross-cultural comparison with an emphasis on the importance of 'relative position' of elements within an arrangement rather than on elements themselves. Pouwer's configurational approach has a synchronic aspect (comparison between cultures) and a diachronic aspect which (following L\u00e9vi-Strauss) he called 'structural history'.\n\nThe configurational approach to cross-cultural comparison may also be viewed against other attempts such as those of [[structural functionalism]], which dealt with institutions and functions.<ref>For example, the comparative functionalism of Walter Goldschmidt.</ref>\n\nSome of the other themes which ran through his teaching (during his years in Wellington, New Zealand-Aotearoa) do not appear strongly in his published work. These include an emphasis on complementary opposition and a both-and approach (in comparison to an either/or logic).\n\nOther themes range from a review of Dutch New Guinea as an Ethnological Field of Study (1961) to a 'travel guide' to the myths of Kamoro and Asmat peoples (2002). In the latter, Pouwer brings an anthropological perspective spanning some fifty years to materials collected by others including Dutch missionaries such as Father G. A. Zegwaard.\n\n===Field of Study===\n\nPouwer's deep concern with questions regarding cross-cultural comparison (and avoiding the comparison of incomparables) was related to the Leiden School's tradition as well as to the theoretical problems of general anthropology. The role played by J.P.B. de Josselin de Jong's idea of  \"Field of Ethnological Study\"  (later, under P.E. de Josselin de Jong,  \"Field of Anthropological Study\" FAS) leads to questions of how to compare and contrast different socio-cultural formations within an area deemed to constitute a field of study. In place of typologies of cultures or simple comparison of 'elements' Pouwer asserted that a concern for 'relative position' of elements is a fundamental structuralist tenet.\n\nPouwer's work demonstrated a Leiden FAS concern for socio-cosmic aspects including dualism and First Peoples' (indigenous) cosmology. He wrote about New Guinea as a field of ethnographic study in 1961 and revisited the topic in 1992.\n\n===Configurational Approach===\n\nIn addition to his 1960s article on a configurational approach, Pouwer spelled out more of his understanding of configurations in 1974. There Pouwer put forward structuring principles which can \"...form a system of relations, a configuration ...\". These include two complementary ''basic'' structuring principles: (a) Identical positioning, and (b) Contra-positioning. There are three ''derived general'' structuring principles: (c) Reciprocal positioning, (d) Equi-positioning, (e) Supra-positioning. To these are added the ''derived particular'' structuring principles: (f) vertical positioning, (g) Horizontal positioning, and (h) Concentric positioning. (Pouwer 1974:241-242)\n\nIn his 2010 book Pouwer said:\n\n\"By 'configuration' I mean a process that turns elements into components arranged and imbued with meaning by a central orientation...Both configuration and orientation can be conceived of as always being on the move, never closed, always open to change, ambivalence and contradiction. A configuration approach assumes a central orientation that permeates a particular society and culture.\" (Pouwer 2010:7-8)<ref>Reimar Schefold 1994:805 on configurational comparisons in relation to FAS.</ref>\n\n===Descent versus Siblingship ===\n\nPouwer's fieldwork in [[New Guinea]] caused him to question the privileged position within modern anthropology given to the notion of 'descent'. He found that there were cases where siblingship was more important in New Guinean people's lives than 'descent'. It is clear from his writings that his fieldwork experiences led him to look for other ways of properly characterising his ethnographic data. Casting various forms of  'descent' as  modalities of 'vertical' arrangement (as derived from general structuring principles), he sought to accommodate the 'horizontal' relationships found in New Guinean social life.  In his 1974 article he was able to conclude that \"The narrow and often shaky criterion of descent is no longer useful or required, nor is it logically defensible. It can be superseded by the criteria of vertical and horizontal arrangement ...\" (Pouwer, 1974:251-252)\n\n===Structuralism and Semiotics===\n\nPouwer's intellectual approach to social structure followed that of [[Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss]] and stood in contrast to the naive empiricism of Radcliffe-Brown. Pouwer, in keeping with a sense of 'becoming' imminent in life, also developed the notion of 'structuration'.\n\nIt is noticeable in his later work that Pouwer does not follow [[L\u00e9vi-Strauss]] into a structuralist analysis of myth and ritual. In his 1975 article he distances himself from an examination of paradigmatic relations at the expense of syntagmatic movements. Pouwer pays homage in that work to a \"Holy Trinity\" of three levels of articulation: 1. symbolic (relationship between signifier and signified), 2. paradigmatic (relationship of one sign to another in its relative position to other signs in a system (limited)), 3. syntagmatic (chain of signs projected in a particular space, time and discourse (unlimited)). All three levels are to be respected.\n\n\"The paramount postulate is that things and events should be studied as if they were signs. The thing-analogy, a tacit postulate of so many studies of social facts and initiated by Durkheim, should be abandoned.\" (Pouwer 1975:97)\n\n===Structural History===\n\nPouwer did not accept a division of labour between history and anthropology, although his history was one of configurations of structuring principles.\n\n\"... the history of the succession of varying configurations of structuring principles in their dialectical interaction with the stream of signified events, has barely begun ...\" (Pouwer 1974:253)\n\n===Reciprocity===\n\nReciprocity formed a chapter of Pouwer's PhD thesis (1955:161-211). The special place of reciprocity in his work stems from  [[Marcel Mauss]], author of \"The Gift\" (1925), who has been cast as an 'ancestor' of Leiden [[structural anthropology]]<ref>Jarich Oosten 2006 on this relationship</ref> as well as from the work of Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss (making use of the same source). Pouwer found reciprocity to be a striking feature of New Guinean life and wrote about ''aopao'' (Kamoro - reciprocity) as a total social fact covering all aspects of Mimika culture. (Pouwer 1975:86; 2002:30;2010:11-13)\n\nLike New Guinean peoples, the notion of reciprocity (and the lack of it) provided Pouwer with a means of comparing aspects of life across socio-cultural boundaries.\n\n==Selected bibliography==\n''Brief dd. 6 december 1953 aan het Hoofd van het Kantoor voor Bevolkingszaken te Hollandia, betreffende: de benutting der tweedeling voor de ontwikkeling van der Mimika,'' Archives Bureau of Native Affairs No. 508, The Hague.\n\n''Enkele aspecten van de Mimika-cultuur (Nederlands Zuidwest Nieuw Guinea)''.
