The reverse depicts a warrior charging into battle on horseback, beneath the letter 'Q', signifying Torquatus' quaestorship.]]\nThe '''gens Manlia''' was one of the oldest and noblest [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]] houses at [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], from the earliest days of the [[Roman Republic|Republic]] until imperial times.  The first of the [[gens]] to obtain the [[Roman consul|consulship]] was [[Gnaeus Manlius Cincinnatus]], consul in 480 BC, and for nearly five centuries its members frequently held the most important [[Roman magistrate|magistracies]].  Many of them were distinguished statesmen and generals, and a number of prominent individuals under the [[Roman Empire|Empire]] claimed the illustrious Manlii among their ancestors.<ref name=\"DGRBM Manlia Gens\">''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology'', vol. II, p. 920 (\"Manlia Gens\").</ref>\n\n==Origin==\nThe Manlii were said to hail from the ancient [[Latins (Italic tribe)|Latin]] city of [[Tusculum]].  The [[Roman naming conventions|nomen]] ''Manlia'' may be a patronymic surname, based on the [[praenomen]] ''[[Manius (praenomen)|Manius]]'', presumably the name of an ancestor of the gens.<ref>Chase, pp. 122, 123.</ref>  The ''gens [[Manilia (gens)|Manilia]]'' was derived from the same name, and its members are frequently confused with the Manlii, as are the [[Mallia (gens)|Mallii]].<ref name=\"DGRBM Manlia Gens\"/>  However, ''Manius'' was not used by any of the Manlii in historical times.  The Manlii were probably numbered amongst the ''gentes maiores'', the greatest of the patrician families.  As with many patrician gentes, the Manlii seem to have acquired plebeian branches as well, and one of the family was [[Tribune of the Plebs|tribune of the plebs]] in the time of [[Cicero]].  The plebeian Manlii were probably descended from [[freedman|freedmen]] of the patricians, from members who had gone over to the plebeians, or from unrelated persons who acquired the nomen after obtaining [[Roman citizenship|the franchise]] from one of the Manlii.\n\n==Praenomina==\nThe Manlii used the praenomina ''[[Publius (praenomen)|Publius]], [[Gnaeus (praenomen)|Gnaeus]], [[Aulus (praenomen)|Aulus]], [[Lucius (praenomen)|Lucius]]'', and ''[[Marcus (praenomen)|Marcus]]''.  The Manlii Torquati also favored the name ''[[Titus (praenomen)|Titus]]'', using primarily that, ''Aulus'', and ''Lucius''.\n\nA well-known story relates that after [[Marcus Manlius Capitolinus]] was condemned for treason, the [[Roman Senate]] decreed that henceforth none of the gens should bear the praenomen ''Marcus''.  However, this legend may have originated as a way to explain the scarcity of the name amongst the Manlii, as the name was rarely used in later generations.\n\n==Branches and cognomina==\n[[File:L._Manlius_Torquatus,_denarius,_82_BC,_RRC_411-1b.jpg|thumb|[[Denarius]] of Lucius Manlius Torquatus, 65 BC.  The obverse depicts the head of the [[Cumaean Sibyl|Sibyl]], while a tripod and amphora, instruments of the ''[[quindecimviri sacris faciundis]]'', appear within a torque on the reverse.]]\n\nThe earliest [[cognomen]] found amongst the Manlii is ''Cincinnatus'', better known from the [[Quinctia (gens)|Quinctia gens]].  This name originally referred to a person with fine, curly hair.  The descendants of Gnaeus Manlius Cincinnatus bore the surname ''Vulso'', meaning \"plucked\", perhaps chosen for its contrast to ''Cincinnatus''.<ref>Chase, pp. 109, 110.</ref>  [[Friedrich M\u00fcnzer|M\u00fcnzer]], noting that the cognomen ''Cincinnatus'' is missing from the older historians, supposed that it might be a mistake, and that ''Vulso'' was the original surname of the Manlian gens.<ref>''PW'', vol. 27, p. 1157.</ref><ref>Broughton, vol. I, p. 25 (note 1).</ref>  The Manlii Vulsones flourished for over three hundred years.<ref>''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology'', vol. III, pp. 1285, 1286 (\"Vulso\").</ref>\n\nThe Manlii Capitolini were descended from the Vulsones, and first appear in the second half of the fifth century BC.  The surname ''Capitolinus'' probably indicates that the family lived on the [[Capitoline Hill]], although the role of Marcus Manlius in saving the Capitol from the [[Gauls]] during the [[Battle of the Allia|sack of Rome]] in 390 BC is also credited with establishing the name in his family.<ref>Chase, pp. 113, 114.</ref>  The surname was relatively short-lived amongst the Manlii, being replaced by that of ''Torquatus''.  This surname was first acquired by [[Titus Manlius Torquatus (347 BC)|Titus Manlius Capitolinus Imperiosus]], who defeated a giant Gaul during a battle in 361 BC, and took his ''[[torc|torque]]'' as a trophy, placing it around his own neck.<ref>Livy, vii. 10.</ref>  The descendants of Torquatus remained prominent until the final decades of the Republic, and adopted the torque as an emblem upon their coins.  ''Imperiosus'', a cognomen borne by Torquatus and his father, was bestowed on account of their imperious manner.<ref>Chase, pp. 110, 111.</ref><ref>''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology'', vol. I, pp. 604, 605 (\"Manlius Capitolinus\"), vol. II, p. 571 (\"Imperiosus\"), vol. III, pp. 1163\u20131165 (\"Manlius Torquatus\").</ref>  The Manlii Torquati were firmly aligned with the aristocratic party toward the end of the Republic, siding first with [[Sulla]], then with [[Pompey|Pompeius]] and the ''[[Assassination of Julius Caesar|Liberatores]]''.  In later times, ''Torquatus'' was borne by the [[Junia (gens)|Junii Silani]], who were descended from the Manlii.\n\nThe Manlii Acidini rose to prominence during the [[Second Punic War]], but achieved only one consulship, in 179, before fading into relative obscurity.  They still flourished in the time of Cicero, who praises their nobility.<ref>Cicero, ''De Lege Agraria'', ii. 24.</ref><ref>''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology'', vol. I, pp. 12, 13 (\"Acidinus\").</ref>\n\nFrom coins of the Manlii featuring the inscriptions ''SER'' and ''SERGIA'', M\u00fcnzer concluded that one ''stirps'' of this gens bore the cognomen ''Sergianus'', indicating descent from the [[Sergia (gens)|Sergia gens]].  However, this probably referred to the ''[[List of Roman tribes|tribus]]'' Sergia; a plebeian branch of the Manlii used the name of their tribe to distinguish themselves from the patrician Manlii, a practice also found among the [[Memmia (gens)|Memmii]].<ref>Eckhel, vol. v, p. 244.</ref><ref>''PW'', vol. 27, p. 1159.</ref><ref>Taylor, ''Voting Districts'', pp. 229, 230.</ref><ref>Mattingly, \"Numismatic Evidence\", pp. 12\u201314.</ref>\n\nTowards the end of the Republic, several early Manlii appear without cognomina, such as Quintus and Gnaeus Manlius, tribunes of the plebs in 69 and 58 BC.<ref name=\"DGRBM Manlia Gens\"/>\n\n==Members==\n{{filiation}}\n\n===Manlii Cincinnati et Vulsones===\n* Publius Manlius, father of the consul Cincinnatus.\n* [[Gnaeus Manlius Cincinnatus|Gnaeus Manlius P. f.

A number of scholars identify him with the [[decemviri|decemvir]] of 451, but this seems doubtful on chronological grounds; he was probably the decemvir's father.{{efn-lr|Livy calls him ''Gaius'', a name not otherwise used by the Manlii, but evidently a mistake for ''Gnaeus'', given in the filiation of his grandson, Aulus Manlius Vulso Capitolinus, consular tribune in 405, 402, and 397.  The two names were nearly always abbreviated, and frequently confounded.  Diodorus calls him ''Marcus'', and Dionysius ''Aulus''.  None of these explicitly identify the decemvir with the consul of 474, nor do Livy or Diodorus state that he had previously been consul, although Dionysius erroneously indicates that he had been consul the previous year.  The chronological difficulty in identifying the decemvir with the consul of 474 arises from the decemvir's son serving as consular tribune three times from 405 to 397; unless he were the child of the decemvir's old age, he would have been rather elderly by the time he first achieved high office, if his father were consul nearly seventy years earlier.}}<ref>Livy, ii. 54.</ref><ref>Dionysius, ix. 36\u201338.</ref><ref>Diodorus Siculus, xi. 63.</ref><ref>''[[Fasti Triumphales]]''.</ref><ref>Broughton, vol.

The first of the [[gens]] to obtain the [[Roman consul|consulship]] was [[Gnaeus Manlius Cincinnatus]], consul in 480 BC, and for nearly five centuries its members frequently held the most important [[Roman magistrate|magistracies]].  Many of them were distinguished statesmen and generals, and a number of prominent individuals under the [[Roman Empire|Empire]] claimed the illustrious Manlii among their ancestors.<ref name=\"DGRBM Manlia Gens\">''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology'', vol. II, p. 920 (\"Manlia Gens\").</ref>\n\n==Origin==\nThe Manlii were said to hail from the ancient [[Latins (Italic tribe)|Latin]] city of [[Tusculum]].  The [[Roman naming conventions|nomen]] ''Manlia'' may be a patronymic surname, based on the [[praenomen]] ''[[Manius (praenomen)|Manius]]'', presumably the name of an ancestor of the gens.<ref>Chase, pp. 122, 123.</ref>  The ''gens [[Manilia (gens)|Manilia]]'' was derived from the same name, and its members are frequently confused with the Manlii, as are the [[Mallia (gens)|Mallii]].<ref name=\"DGRBM Manlia Gens\"/>  However, ''Manius'' was not used by any of the Manlii in historical times.  The Manlii were probably numbered amongst the ''gentes maiores'', the greatest of the patrician families.  As with many patrician gentes, the Manlii seem to have acquired plebeian branches as well, and one of the family was [[Tribune of the Plebs|tribune of the plebs]] in the time of [[Cicero]].  The plebeian Manlii were probably descended from [[freedman|freedmen]] of the patricians, from members who had gone over to the plebeians, or from unrelated persons who acquired the nomen after obtaining [[Roman citizenship|the franchise]] from one of the Manlii.\n\n==Praenomina==\nThe Manlii used the praenomina ''[[Publius (praenomen)|Publius]], [[Gnaeus (praenomen)|Gnaeus]], [[Aulus (praenomen)|Aulus]], [[Lucius (praenomen)|Lucius]]'', and ''[[Marcus (praenomen)|Marcus]]''.  The Manlii Torquati also favored the name ''[[Titus (praenomen)|Titus]]'', using primarily that, ''Aulus'', and ''Lucius''.\n\nA well-known story relates that after [[Marcus Manlius Capitolinus]] was condemned for treason, the [[Roman Senate]] decreed that henceforth none of the gens should bear the praenomen ''Marcus''.  However, this legend may have originated as a way to explain the scarcity of the name amongst the Manlii, as the name was rarely used in later generations.\n\n==Branches and cognomina==\n[[File:L._Manlius_Torquatus,_denarius,_82_BC,_RRC_411-1b.jpg|thumb|[[Denarius]] of Lucius Manlius Torquatus, 65 BC.  The obverse depicts the head of the [[Cumaean Sibyl|Sibyl]], while a tripod and amphora, instruments of the ''[[quindecimviri sacris faciundis]]'', appear within a torque on the reverse.]]\n\nThe earliest [[cognomen]] found amongst the Manlii is ''Cincinnatus'', better known from the [[Quinctia (gens)|Quinctia gens]].  This name originally referred to a person with fine, curly hair.  The descendants of Gnaeus Manlius Cincinnatus bore the surname ''Vulso'', meaning \"plucked\", perhaps chosen for its contrast to ''Cincinnatus''.<ref>Chase, pp. 109, 110.</ref>  [[Friedrich M\u00fcnzer|M\u00fcnzer]], noting that the cognomen ''Cincinnatus'' is missing from the older historians, supposed that it might be a mistake, and that ''Vulso'' was the original surname of the Manlian gens.<ref>''PW'', vol. 27, p. 1157.</ref><ref>Broughton, vol. I, p. 25 (note 1).</ref>  The Manlii Vulsones flourished for over three hundred years.<ref>''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology'', vol. III, pp. 1285, 1286 (\"Vulso\").</ref>\n\nThe Manlii Capitolini were descended from the Vulsones, and first appear in the second half of the fifth century BC.  The surname ''Capitolinus'' probably indicates that the family lived on the [[Capitoline Hill]], although the role of Marcus Manlius in saving the Capitol from the [[Gauls]] during the [[Battle of the Allia|sack of Rome]] in 390 BC is also credited with establishing the name in his family.<ref>Chase, pp. 113, 114.</ref>  The surname was relatively short-lived amongst the Manlii, being replaced by that of ''Torquatus''.  This surname was first acquired by [[Titus Manlius Torquatus (347 BC)|Titus Manlius Capitolinus Imperiosus]], who defeated a giant Gaul during a battle in 361 BC, and took his ''[[torc|torque]]'' as a trophy, placing it around his own neck.<ref>Livy, vii. 10.</ref>  The descendants of Torquatus remained prominent until the final decades of the Republic, and adopted the torque as an emblem upon their coins.  ''Imperiosus'', a cognomen borne by Torquatus and his father, was bestowed on account of their imperious manner.<ref>Chase, pp. 110, 111.</ref><ref>''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology'', vol. I, pp. 604, 605 (\"Manlius Capitolinus\"), vol. II, p. 571 (\"Imperiosus\"), vol. III, pp. 1163\u20131165 (\"Manlius Torquatus\").</ref>  The Manlii Torquati were firmly aligned with the aristocratic party toward the end of the Republic, siding first with [[Sulla]], then with [[Pompey|Pompeius]] and the ''[[Assassination of Julius Caesar|Liberatores]]''.  In later times, ''Torquatus'' was borne by the [[Junia (gens)|Junii Silani]], who were descended from the Manlii.\n\nThe Manlii Acidini rose to prominence during the [[Second Punic War]], but achieved only one consulship, in 179, before fading into relative obscurity.  They still flourished in the time of Cicero, who praises their nobility.<ref>Cicero, ''De Lege Agraria'', ii. 24.</ref><ref>''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology'', vol. I, pp. 12, 13 (\"Acidinus\").</ref>\n\nFrom coins of the Manlii featuring the inscriptions ''SER'' and ''SERGIA'', M\u00fcnzer concluded that one ''stirps'' of this gens bore the cognomen ''Sergianus'', indicating descent from the [[Sergia (gens)|Sergia gens]].  However, this probably referred to the ''[[List of Roman tribes|tribus]]'' Sergia; a plebeian branch of the Manlii used the name of their tribe to distinguish themselves from the patrician Manlii, a practice also found among the [[Memmia (gens)|Memmii]].<ref>Eckhel, vol. v, p. 244.</ref><ref>''PW'', vol. 27, p. 1159.</ref><ref>Taylor, ''Voting Districts'', pp. 229, 230.</ref><ref>Mattingly, \"Numismatic Evidence\", pp. 12\u201314.</ref>\n\nTowards the end of the Republic, several early Manlii appear without cognomina, such as Quintus and Gnaeus Manlius, tribunes of the plebs in 69 and 58 BC.<ref name=\"DGRBM Manlia Gens\"/>\n\n==Members==\n{{filiation}}\n\n===Manlii Cincinnati et Vulsones===\n* Publius Manlius, father of the consul Cincinnatus.\n* [[Gnaeus Manlius Cincinnatus|Gnaeus Manlius P. f.

A number of scholars identify him with the [[decemviri|decemvir]] of 451, but this seems doubtful on chronological grounds; he was probably the decemvir's father.{{efn-lr|Livy calls him ''Gaius'', a name not otherwise used by the Manlii, but evidently a mistake for ''Gnaeus'', given in the filiation of his grandson, Aulus Manlius Vulso Capitolinus, consular tribune in 405, 402, and 397.  The two names were nearly always abbreviated, and frequently confounded.  Diodorus calls him ''Marcus'', and Dionysius ''Aulus''.  None of these explicitly identify the decemvir with the consul of 474, nor do Livy or Diodorus state that he had previously been consul, although Dionysius erroneously indicates that he had been consul the previous year.  The chronological difficulty in identifying the decemvir with the consul of 474 arises from the decemvir's son serving as consular tribune three times from 405 to 397; unless he were the child of the decemvir's old age, he would have been rather elderly by the time he first achieved high office, if his father were consul nearly seventy years earlier.}}<ref>Livy, ii. 54.</ref><ref>Dionysius, ix. 36\u201338.</ref><ref>Diodorus Siculus, xi. 63.</ref><ref>''[[Fasti Triumphales]]''.</ref><ref>Broughton, vol.

In his work he called the quantity basic reproduction rate and denoted it by ''Z''<sub>0</sub>. Calling the quantity a \"rate\" can be misleading, insofar as it can be interpreted as number per unit of time. The expressions number or ratio are now preferred.\n\n== Definitions in specific cases ==\n=== Reproductive number as it relates to contact rate and infectious period ===\n[[File:R Naught Ebola and Flu Diagram.svg|thumb|''R''<sub>0</sub> is the average number of people infected from one other person, for example, Ebola has an ''R''<sub>0</sub> of two, so on average, a person who has Ebola will pass it on to two other people.]]\n\nSuppose that infectious individuals make an average of <math>\\beta</math> infection-producing contacts per unit time, with a mean infectious period of <math>\\tau</math>. Then the basic reproduction number is:\n\n:<math> R_0 = \\beta\\,\\tau</math>\n\nThis simple formula suggests different ways of reducing ''R''<sub>0</sub> and ultimately infection propagation. It is possible to decrease the number of infection-producing contacts per unit time <math>\\beta</math> by reducing the number of contacts per unit time (for example staying at home if the infection requires contact with others to propagate) or the proportion of contacts that produces infection (for example wearing some sort of protective equipment). It is also possible to decrease the infectious period <math>\\tau</math> by finding and then isolating, treating or eliminating (as is often the case with animals) infectious individuals as soon as possible.\n\n=== With varying latent periods ===\nIn cases of diseases with varying latent periods, the basic reproduction number can be calculated as the sum of the reproduction number for each transition time into the disease. An example of this is tuberculosis. Blower and coauthors calculated from a simple model of TB the following reproduction number:<ref>{{cite journal |last=Blower |first=S. M. |last2=Mclean |first2=A.

The definition must account for the fact that a typical infected individual may not be an average individual. As an extreme example, consider a population in which a small portion of the individuals mix fully with one another while the remaining individuals are all isolated. A disease may be able to spread in the fully mixed portion even though a randomly selected individual would lead to fewer than one secondary case. This is because the typical infected individual is in the fully mixed portion and thus is able to successfully cause infections. In general, if the individuals who become infected early in an epidemic may be more (or less) likely to transmit than a randomly chosen individual late in the epidemic, then our computation of ''R''<sub>0</sub> must account for this tendency.

In his work he called the quantity basic reproduction rate and denoted it by ''Z''<sub>0</sub>. Calling the quantity a \"rate\" can be misleading, insofar as it can be interpreted as number per unit of time. The expressions number or ratio are now preferred.\n\n== Definitions in specific cases ==\n=== Reproductive number as it relates to contact rate and infectious period ===\n[[File:R Naught Ebola and Flu Diagram.svg|thumb|''R''<sub>0</sub> is the average number of people infected from one other person, for example, Ebola has an ''R''<sub>0</sub> of two, so on average, a person who has Ebola will pass it on to two other people.]]\n\nSuppose that infectious individuals make an average of <math>\\beta</math> infection-producing contacts per unit time, with a mean infectious period of <math>\\tau</math>. Then the basic reproduction number is:\n\n:<math> R_0 = \\beta\\,\\tau</math>\n\nThis simple formula suggests different ways of reducing ''R''<sub>0</sub> and ultimately infection propagation. It is possible to decrease the number of infection-producing contacts per unit time <math>\\beta</math> by reducing the number of contacts per unit time (for example staying at home if the infection requires contact with others to propagate) or the proportion of contacts that produces infection (for example wearing some sort of protective equipment). It is also possible to decrease the infectious period <math>\\tau</math> by finding and then isolating, treating or eliminating (as is often the case with animals) infectious individuals as soon as possible.\n\n=== With varying latent periods ===\nIn cases of diseases with varying latent periods, the basic reproduction number can be calculated as the sum of the reproduction number for each transition time into the disease. An example of this is tuberculosis. Blower and coauthors calculated from a simple model of TB the following reproduction number:<ref>{{cite journal |last=Blower |first=S. M. |last2=Mclean |first2=A.

The definition must account for the fact that a typical infected individual may not be an average individual. As an extreme example, consider a population in which a small portion of the individuals mix fully with one another while the remaining individuals are all isolated. A disease may be able to spread in the fully mixed portion even though a randomly selected individual would lead to fewer than one secondary case. This is because the typical infected individual is in the fully mixed portion and thus is able to successfully cause infections. In general, if the individuals who become infected early in an epidemic may be more (or less) likely to transmit than a randomly chosen individual late in the epidemic, then our computation of ''R''<sub>0</sub> must account for this tendency. An appropriate definition for ''R''<sub>0</sub> in this case is \"the expected number of secondary cases produced by a typical infected individual early in an epidemic\".<ref name=\"Diekmann\">{{cite journal|author=O Diekmann|author2=J.A.P.

Borough of Barrington''' was a legal case in the US. In the case, it was decided that a family's privacy rights were violated when a police officer told their neighbors that the husband had [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]] after he had relayed that information to the police during a search. Because the information was given to a state employee in confidence, and because there was no compelling government interest in giving that information to the neighbors, the police violated the family's privacy rights by telling the neighbors of the husband's condition. It also caused substantial harm to the family due to the [[Social stigma|stigma]] that was attached to the wife and children after this information was revealed. Some of the names were changed to protect their identities.\n\n== Facts of the Case ==\n\nOn March 25, 1987, Jane Doe, her husband, and their friend James Tarvis were driving in the Doe's pickup truck through the [[Barrington, New Jersey|Borough of Barrington]] when they were stopped by police and, after some questioning, Jane Doe's husband was arrested. They were all escorted to the police station and the pickup truck was impounded. Jane Doe and James Tarvis were released, but Jane's husband was kept in custody. He warned the police officers that he was [[HIV|HIV positive]] and that they should be careful while searching him because he had \"weeping lesions\".{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\nJane Doe and James Tarvis returned to Jane's home, in [[Runnemede, New Jersey|Runnemede]], in Tarvis' car. While at the home, the car (which was left running) slipped into gear and slid into the neighbors' fence. The neighbors, Rita and Michael DiAngelo, were speaking to Runnemede officers who were informed by a Barrington officer of Jane Doe's husband's AIDS. After Jane Doe and Tarvis left the immediate vicinity, one of the Runnemede officers, Officer Smith, informed the DiAngelos of Jane's husband's condition, telling them that they should wash with disinfectant just to be on the safe side. Rita, who worked for the Runnemede school district and who had a child in the same school as the four Doe children, called other parents with children in the same school and called the media. Eleven parents pulled nineteen children out of the school and the media covered the story. At least one reporter mentioned the Does' name. The Does claimed that, after this happened they suffered from discrimination, harassment and humiliation.{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\n== Ruling ==\n\nThere were a few reasons why the court decided in favor of the Does.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}} The court stated that the Does' right to privacy was violated because the information that Jane Doe's husband gave the police officers (being HIV positive) was confidential information.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}} Even though the information was given willingly and without prompting, Jane Doe's husband offered that information in a private setting to government officials who are expected to keep that kind of information secret. While the Barrington officers may have only told Runnemede officers, it was a Runnemede officer, Officer Smith, who broke this confidence.\n\nFurthermore, the fact that there was absolutely no reason for Officer Smith to give that information to the DiAngelos plays a part in this ruling. Enough information was available at the time to support the conclusion that mere physical contact would not spread the disease. Telling the DiAngelos to wash with disinfectant in order to prevent the spread of the disease to them was not a compelling government interest in breaking the confidence for two reasons: First, there's no way the DiAngelos could get the disease from mere physical contact, and this was known at the time of the incident; second, because they could not contract the disease from this physical contact, there was no need to tell them to wash with disinfectant, because it was unnecessary.{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nSomething else that played a part in the court's decision was the stigma attached to AIDS.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}} While enough scientific research was known at the time about AIDS, people still attached negative stigmas to those who were infected. Usually, people associated AIDS with homosexuals and drug users. Because of this stigma, the court in this case found that the stigma attached to Jane Doe and her children, coupled with the fact that there was no compelling interest in revealing Jane Doe's husband's condition to Jane Doe's neighbors, constituted a breach of privacy that should have been extended not only to Jane Doe's husband but to the entire family. Also, this type of information being of the most personal kind weighted greatly in favor of Jane Doe's husband.\n\n== Precedence ==\n\nCases that helped the court reach this decision were:{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\n[[Whalen v. Roe]] (In this case, it was determined that the government has a duty not to disclose private information. Because police officers are considered government employees, this duty applies to them).\n\n[[United States v. Westinghouse Electric Co.|United States v. Westinghouse]] (This is the case where the standard of weighing societal interests in disclosure against the privacy interest involved).\n\nCarter v. Broadlawns Medical Center (Here, the medical center released medical records to the center's chaplain. The court decided this was a breach of privacy, even though the chaplain could have been considered a person in a confidence-keeping position, because it was unnecessary to release the records to this chaplain for the purposes of his employment).\n\nWoods v. White (A person's right to privacy does not vanish simply because they're incarcerated. Here, an inmate's medical history \u2013 and the fact that he had AIDS \u2013 was revealed to prison personnel who didn't need to know about his medical history to fulfill their employment duties).{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\n== Constitution ==\n\nThe [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th Amendment]] doesn't explicitly guarantee a right to privacy. Section 1 of the 14th Amendment states: \"All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside. No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any state deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\"\n\nThere is a lot of debate in many cases over what this actually means. The part that keeps the state from depriving a person of life, liberty or property has been interpreted, in this case, to allow a right to privacy. The police officers being considered government employees makes them representatives of the state. Since the state cannot deprive a person of their liberty, and part of that liberty is a right to privacy, the police here had no reason to break Jane Doe's husband's confidence and reveal to the DiAngelos his AIDS diagnosis.{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n* [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11648194]\n* [http://www.hivlawandpolicy.org/resources/view/408]\n\n[[Category:United States privacy case law]]\n", "text_old": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{Underlinked|date=February 2018}}\n{{Orphan|date=February 2018}}\n}}\n\n'''Doe v.

Section 1 of the 14th Amendment states: \"All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside. No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any state deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\"\n\nThere is a lot of debate in many cases over what this actually means. The part that keeps the state from depriving a person of life, liberty or property has been interpreted, in this case, to allow a right to privacy. The police officers being considered government employees makes them representatives of the state. Since the state cannot deprive a person of their liberty, and part of that liberty is a right to privacy, the police here had no reason to break Jane Doe's husband's confidence and reveal to the DiAngelos his AIDS diagnosis.{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n* [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11648194]\n* [http://www.hivlawandpolicy.org/resources/view/408]\n\n[[Category:United States privacy case law]]\n", "name_user": "Falconbravo", "label": "safe", "comment": "Added a few wikilinks and made a few typographical/grammatical corrections", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doe_v._Borough_of_Barrington"}

Bxf6 Bxf6''' this line was extensively tested in the Kasparov&ndash;Karpov matches in 1980s. To this day Black has no problems in this line despite being tested at the highest levels. More recently, [[Boris Gelfand]] defended the Black side of this variation in the 2011 candidates matches which eventually he went on to win. For example, in the third round of the final candidate match, he forced White to accept a [[draw (chess)|draw]] in 14 moves with a very strong novelty: [http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1622851 Grischuk vs. Gelfand, Elista 2011].\n*'''Lasker Defense''': '''5... 0-0 6. e3 h6 7. Bh4 Ne4 8. Bxe7 Qxe7''', is also a solid line, often leading to the exchange of two sets of minor pieces. It was this line that [[Viswanathan Anand]] chose in the final game of the [[World Chess Championship 2010]] in order to defeat [[Veselin Topalov]] and retain the world championship.\n*'''Orthodox Defense''': '''5... 0-0 6. e3 Nbd7 7. Rc1 c6''' and now White has two main moves: 8.Bd3 and 8.Qc2. After 8.Bd3 dxc4 9.Bxc4 Black has surrendered the centre and stands somewhat cramped, but has succeeded in making White lose a tempo by playing Bd3 before Bxc4. White will try to use his advantage in space to attack, whereas Black will try to keep White at bay while striking back at the centre. Capablanca's main idea here was the freeing maneuver 9...Nd5 10.Bxe7 Qxe7 11.0-0 Nxc3 12.Rxc3 e5 13.dxe5 Nxe5 14.Nxe5 Qxe5 15.f4 Qe7, which has led to a number of exchanges in the centre, though Black must exercise care even in the wake of this simplification. This line was once so frequently played that it has a separate code (D69) in ''ECO'', though the lack of active counter play for Black has made the main line of the Orthodox a backwater in modern practice.<ref>{{cite book|last=De Firmian|first=Nick|title=Modern Chess Openings|publisher=Random House|year=1999|edition=14th|isbn=0-8129-3084-3}}</ref>\n\n===Cambridge Springs Defense: 4.Bg5 Nbd7 {{anchor|Cambridge Springs Defense}}===\n{{main|Cambridge Springs Defense}}\nThe Cambridge Springs Defense was introduced more than a century ago, and is still played. (1.d4 d5 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 Nf6) '''4. Bg5 Nbd7''' (setting up the [[Elephant Trap]]) '''5. e3 c6 6. Nf3 Qa5''', now Black intends ...Bb4 and possibly ...Ne4, with pressure along the a5\u2013e1 diagonal. This Black defense is popular among amateurs because there are several traps White can fall into, for example '''7. Nd2''' (one of the main lines, countering Black's pressure along the diagonal) '''7... Bb4 8. Qc2 0-0''' and here 9.Bd3{{chesspunc|??}} loses since 9...dxc4{{chesspunc|!}} (threatening ...Qxg5) 10.Bxf6 cxd3!

Qc2''' and White has a pawn majority in the centre, Black has a pawn majority on the {{chessgloss|queenside}}. This pawn structure gives White the opportunity to either advance his pawns in the centre by means of Nge2, f2\u2013f3, followed by e2\u2013e4, or play for a {{chessgloss|minority attack}} by means of the plan Rb1, followed by b2\u2013b4\u2013b5, then bxc6 in order to create a weak pawn at c6. While Black can play ...cxb5, or recapture on c6 with a piece, each of these possibilities are even less desirable than the [[backward pawn]] in the open file. For Black, exchanging at d5 has released his light-squared bishop and opened the e-file, giving him the use of e4 as a springboard for central and {{chessgloss|kingside}} play. While chances are balanced, Black is usually more or less forced to use his superior activity to launch a piece attack on White's [[king (chess)|king]], as the long-term chances in the QGD Exchange structure favour White. The following games are model games for White:\n\n*Central pawn advance: Carlsen vs. Jakovenko, Nanjing 2009<ref>[http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1559010 Carlsen vs. Jakovenko, Nanjing 2009] [[Chessgames.com]]</ref>\n*Minority attack: Evans vs. Opsahl, Dubrovnik 1950<ref>[http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1152575 Evans vs. Opsahl, Dubrovnik 1950] [[Chessgames.com]]</ref>\n\n===Ragozin Variation: 4.Nf3 Bb4 {{anchor|Ragozin Variation}}===\nThe Ragozin Variation (''ECO'' code D37\u2013D39) occurs after (1.d4 d5 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 Nf6) '''4. Nf3 Bb4'''. An important line in this variation is the Vienna Variation where the game continues: '''5. Bg5 dxc4 6. e4'''. White's pawns or pieces occupy the central squares in exchange for long-term pawn structure weaknesses. An instance of Vienna Variation played at the highest level was [http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1042467 Fine vs. Euwe, AVRO 1938].\n\n===Harrwitz Attack 4.Nf3 Be7 5.Bf4===\n\nThis variation is also a popular line. Placing the bishop on Bg5 allows Black to exchange more freely with moves like Nf6-e4, as seen in the Lasker Defence. The move Bf4 is designed to restrict Black's opportunities in this way, as well as reducing opportunities to gain the [[bishop pair]].<ref name=\"Sadler\">{{cite book |last1=Sadler |first1=Matthew |title=Queen's Gambit Declined |date=2000 |publisher=Everyman Chess |location=London |isbn=1857442563 |page=161}}</ref> Play usually continues with '''5...0-0 6. e3 c5 7. dxc5 Bxc5'''.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Janjgava |first1=Lasha |title=The Queen's Gambit & Catalan for Black |date=2000 |publisher=Gambit Publications Ltd |isbn=1901983374 |page=24}}</ref> [[Peter Leko]], usually an e4 player, used this variation as White to beat [[Vladimir Kramnik]] in their [[Classical World Chess Championship 2004|2004 World Championship Match]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Queen's Gambit]]\n* [[Queen's Gambit Accepted]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n'''Bibliography'''\n* {{cite book | last1=Kasparov | first1=Garry | author1-link=Garry Kasparov | first2=Raymond | last2=Keene | author2-link=Raymond Keene | title=Batsford Chess Openings 2 | origyear=1989| year=1994 | publisher=Henry Holt | isbn=0-8050-3409-9}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{wikibooks|Chess Opening Theory|1. d4/1...d5/2. c4/2...e6|Queen's Gambit Declined}}\n*{{cite book\n | author=Lalic, Bogdan\n | title=Queen's Gambit Declined: Bg5 Systems\n | publisher=[[Everyman Chess]]\n | isbn=978-1-857-44240-3\n | year=2000\n | authorlink=Bogdan Lali\u0107\n | url-access=registration\n | url=https://archive.org/details/queensgambitdecl00lali\n }}\n*{{cite book\n | author=Ward, Chris\n | title=Unusual Queen's Gambit Declined\n | publisher=[[Everyman Chess]]\n | year=2002\n | isbn=1-857-44218-0\n | authorlink=Chris Ward (chess player)}}\n*{{cite book\n | author=McDonald, Neil\n | year=2006\n | title=Starting Out: Queen's Gambit Declined\n | publisher=[[Everyman Chess]]\n | isbn=978-1-857-44426-1}}\n*{{cite book\n | title=Chess Explained: The Queen's Gambit Declined\n | year=2007\n | author=Rizzitano, James\n | publisher=Gambit Publications\n | isbn=978-1-904-60080-0}}\n*{{cite book\n | author=Komarov, Dmitry\n |author2=Djuric, Stefan |author3=Pantaleoni, Claudio\n  | title=Chess Opening Essentials, Vol. 2: 1.d4 d5 / 1.d4 various / Queen's Gambits\n | publisher=[[New In Chess]]\n | year=2009\n | isbn=978-9-056-91269-7}}\n\n{{Chess|state=collapsed}}\n\n[[Category:Chess openings]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox chess opening\n|openingname = Queen's Gambit Declined  \n|image = {{Chess diagram\n|\n|\n|rd|nd|bd|qd|kd|bd|nd|rd\n|pd|pd|pd|  |  |pd|pd|pd\n|  |  |  |  |pd|  |  |  \n|  |  |  |pd|  |  |  |  \n|  |  |pl|pl|  |  |  |  \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|pl|pl|  |  |pl|pl|pl|pl\n|rl|nl|bl|ql|kl|bl|nl|rl\n|}}\n|moves =1.d4 d5 2.c4 e6\n|ECO =D30\u2013D69\n|birth =\n|nameorigin =\n|parentopening =[[Queen's Gambit]]\n|chessgid =75974&move=3&moves=d4.d5.c4.e6&nodes=10703.75972.75973.75974\n}}\n\nThe '''Queen's Gambit Declined''' (or '''QGD''') is a [[chess opening]] in which Black declines a pawn offered by White in the [[Queen's Gambit]]:\n:1.

White has several ways of dealing with Black's setup:\n\n===QGD Main Variations: 4.Bg5 Be7 5.Nf3 {{anchor|QGD Main Variations}}===\n{{Chess diagram\n| tright\n| QGD Main Line \n|rd|nd|bd|qd|kd||  |rd\n|pd|pd|pd|  |bd  |pd|pd|pd\n|  |  |  |  |pd|nd|  |  \n|  |  |  |pd|  |  | bl|  \n|  |  |pl|pl|  |  |  |  \n|  |  |nl|  |  |nl  |  |  \n|pl|pl|  |  |pl|pl|pl|pl\n|rl|  | |ql|kl|bl||rl\n| 1.d4 d5 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.Bg5 Be7 5.Nf3\n}}\n*'''Tartakower Defense''' or '''Tartakower\u2013Makogonov\u2013Bondarevsky System (TMB system)''': '''5... h6 6. Bh4 0-0 7. e3 b6''', is one of the most solid continuations for Black.\n*'''Anti-Tartakower\u2013Makogonov\u2013Bondarevsky (Anti-TMB)''': '''5... h6 6. Bxf6 Bxf6''' this line was extensively tested in the Kasparov&ndash;Karpov matches in 1980s. To this day Black has no problems in this line despite being tested at the highest levels. Most recently Boris Gelfand defended the Black side of this variation in the 2011 candidates matches which eventually he went on to win. For example, in the third round of the final candidate match, he forced White to accept a [[draw (chess)|draw]] in 14 moves with a very strong novelty: [http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1622851 Grischuk vs. Gelfand, Elista 2011].\n*'''Lasker Defense''': '''5... 0-0 6. e3 h6 7. Bh4 Ne4 8. Bxe7 Qxe7''', is also a solid line, often leading to the exchange of two sets of minor pieces. It was this line that [[Viswanathan Anand]] chose in the final game of the [[World Chess Championship 2010]] in order to defeat [[Veselin Topalov]] and retain the world championship.\n*'''Orthodox Defense''': '''5... 0-0 6. e3 Nbd7 7. Rc1 c6''' and now White has two main moves: 8.Bd3 and 8.Qc2. After 8.Bd3 dxc4 9.Bxc4 Black has surrendered the centre and stands somewhat cramped, but has succeeded in making White lose a tempo by playing Bd3 before Bxc4. White will try to use his advantage in space to attack, whereas Black will try to keep White at bay while striking back at the centre. Capablanca's main idea here was the freeing maneuver 9...Nd5 10.Bxe7 Qxe7 11.0-0 Nxc3 12.Rxc3 e5 13.dxe5 Nxe5 14.Nxe5 Qxe5 15.f4 Qe7, which has led to a number of exchanges in the centre, though Black must exercise care even in the wake of this simplification. This line was once so frequently played that it has a separate code (D69) in ''ECO'', though the lack of active counter play for Black has made the main line of the Orthodox a backwater in modern practice.<ref>{{cite book|last=De Firmian|first=Nick|title=Modern Chess Openings|publisher=Random House|year=1999|edition=14th|isbn=0-8129-3084-3}}</ref>\n\n===Cambridge Springs Defense: 4.Bg5 Nbd7 {{anchor|Cambridge Springs Defense}}===\n{{main|Cambridge Springs Defense}}\nThe Cambridge Springs Defense was introduced more than a century ago, and is still played. (1.d4 d5 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 Nf6) '''4. Bg5 Nbd7''' (setting up the [[Elephant Trap]]) '''5. e3 c6 6. Nf3 Qa5''', now Black intends ...Bb4 and possibly ...Ne4, with pressure along the a5\u2013e1 diagonal. This Black defense is popular among amateurs because there are several traps White can fall into, for example '''7. Nd2''' (one of the main lines, countering Black's pressure along the diagonal) '''7... Bb4 8. Qc2 0-0''' and here 9.Bd3{{chesspunc|??}} loses since 9...dxc4{{chesspunc|!}} (threatening ...Qxg5) 10.Bxf6 cxd3! (a [[zwischenzug]]) 11.Qxd3 Nxf6 wins a piece for Black.\n\n===Exchange Variation: 4.cxd5 exd5 {{anchor|Exchange Variation}}===\n(1.d4 d5 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 Nf6) '''4. cxd5 exd5 5. Bg5 c6 6. Qc2''' and White has a pawn majority in the centre, Black has a pawn majority on the {{chessgloss|queenside}}. This pawn structure gives White the opportunity to either advance his pawns in the centre by means of Nge2, f2\u2013f3, followed by e2\u2013e4, or play for a {{chessgloss|minority attack}} by means of the plan Rb1, followed by b2\u2013b4\u2013b5, then bxc6 in order to create a weak pawn at c6. While Black can play ...cxb5, or recapture on c6 with a piece, each of these possibilities are even less desirable than the [[backward pawn]] in the open file. For Black, exchanging at d5 has released his light-squared bishop and opened the e-file, giving him the use of e4 as a springboard for central and {{chessgloss|kingside}} play. While chances are balanced, Black is usually more or less forced to use his superior activity to launch a piece attack on White's [[king (chess)|king]], as the long-term chances in the QGD Exchange structure favour White. The following games are model games for White:\n\n*Central pawn advance: Carlsen vs. Jakovenko, Nanjing 2009<ref>[http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1559010 Carlsen vs. Jakovenko, Nanjing 2009] [[Chessgames.com]]</ref>\n*Minority attack: Evans vs. Opsahl, Dubrovnik 1950<ref>[http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1152575 Evans vs. Opsahl, Dubrovnik 1950] [[Chessgames.com]]</ref>\n\n===Ragozin Variation: 4.Nf3 Bb4 {{anchor|Ragozin Variation}}===\nThe Ragozin Variation (''ECO'' code D37\u2013D39) occurs after (1.d4 d5 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 Nf6) '''4. Nf3 Bb4'''. An important line in this variation is the Vienna Variation where the game continues: '''5. Bg5 dxc4 6. e4'''. White's pawns or pieces occupy the central squares in exchange for long-term pawn structure weaknesses. An instance of Vienna Variation played at the highest level was [http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1042467 Fine vs. Euwe, AVRO 1938].\n\n===Harrwitz Attack 4.Nf3 Be7 5.Bf4===\n\nThis variation is also a popular line. Placing the bishop on Bg5 allows Black to exchange more freely with moves like Nf6-e4, as seen in the Lasker Defence. The move Bf4 is designed to restrict Black's opportunities in this way, as well as reducing opportunities to gain the [[bishop pair]].<ref name=\"Sadler\">{{cite book |last1=Sadler |first1=Matthew |title=Queen's Gambit Declined |date=2000 |publisher=Everyman Chess |location=London |isbn=1857442563 |page=161}}</ref> Play usually continues with '''5...0-0 6. e3 c5 7. dxc5 Bxc5'''.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Janjgava |first1=Lasha |title=The Queen's Gambit & Catalan for Black |date=2000 |publisher=Gambit Publications Ltd |isbn=1901983374 |page=24}}</ref> [[Peter Leko]], usually an e4 player, used this variation as White to beat [[Vladimir Kramnik]] in their [[Classical World Chess Championship 2004|2004 World Championship Match]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Queen's Gambit]]\n* [[Queen's Gambit Accepted]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n'''Bibliography'''\n* {{cite book | last1=Kasparov | first1=Garry | author1-link=Garry Kasparov | first2=Raymond | last2=Keene | author2-link=Raymond Keene | title=Batsford Chess Openings 2 | origyear=1989| year=1994 | publisher=Henry Holt | isbn=0-8050-3409-9}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{wikibooks|Chess Opening Theory|1. d4/1...d5/2. c4/2...e6|Queen's Gambit Declined}}\n*{{cite book\n | author=Lalic, Bogdan\n | title=Queen's Gambit Declined: Bg5 Systems\n | publisher=[[Everyman Chess]]\n | isbn=978-1-857-44240-3\n | year=2000\n | authorlink=Bogdan Lali\u0107\n | url-access=registration\n | url=https://archive.org/details/queensgambitdecl00lali\n }}\n*{{cite book\n | author=Ward, Chris\n | title=Unusual Queen's Gambit Declined\n | publisher=[[Everyman Chess]]\n | year=2002\n | isbn=1-857-44218-0\n | authorlink=Chris Ward (chess player)}}\n*{{cite book\n | author=McDonald, Neil\n | year=2006\n | title=Starting Out: Queen's Gambit Declined\n | publisher=[[Everyman Chess]]\n | isbn=978-1-857-44426-1}}\n*{{cite book\n | title=Chess Explained: The Queen's Gambit Declined\n | year=2007\n | author=Rizzitano, James\n | publisher=Gambit Publications\n | isbn=978-1-904-60080-0}}\n*{{cite book\n | author=Komarov, Dmitry\n |author2=Djuric, Stefan |author3=Pantaleoni, Claudio\n  | title=Chess Opening Essentials, Vol. 2: 1.d4 d5 / 1.d4 various / Queen's Gambits\n | publisher=[[New In Chess]]\n | year=2009\n | isbn=978-9-056-91269-7}}\n\n{{Chess|state=collapsed}}\n\n[[Category:Chess openings]]\n", "name_user": "Knucmo2", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eBlack plays 3...Nf6:time + link", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen%27s_Gambit_Declined"}

Medals and, in some cases, money were awarded to individuals who achieved success in published challenges within the categories of Agriculture, Polite Arts, Manufacture, Colonies and Trade, Chemistry and Mechanics. Successful submission included agricultural improvements in the cultivation of crops and reforestation, devising new forms of machinery, including an extendable ladder to aid firefighting that has remained in use relatively unchanged, and artistic skill, through submissions by young students, many of whom developed into famous artists e.g. [[Edwin Landseer]] who at the age of 10 was awarded a silver medal for his drawing of a dog.\n\nThe RSA originally specifically precluded premiums for [[patent]]ed solutions.<ref>http://sitoc.biz/adelphicharter/pdfs/RSA_IP_Final.pdf</ref> Today the RSA continues to offer premiums.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thersa.org/action-research-centre/enterprise-and-design/enterprise/premiums|title=RSA Premiums}}</ref>\n\nIn 1936, the RSA awarded the first distinctions of [[Royal Designers for Industry]] (RDI or HonRDI), reserved for \"those very few who in the judgment of their peers have achieved 'sustained excellence in aesthetic and efficient design for industry'\".\n\nIn 1937 \"The Faculty of Royal Designers for Industry\" was established as an association with the object of \"furthering excellence in design and its application to industrial purposes\": membership of the Faculty is automatic for (and exclusive to) all RDIs and HonRDIs. The Faculty currently has 120 Royal Designers (RDI) and 45 Honorary Royal Designers (non-UK citizens who are awarded the accolade of HonRDI): the number of designers who may hold the distinction of RDI at any one time is strictly limited.\n\nThe Faculty consists of the world's leading practitioners from fields as disparate as engineering, furniture, fashion and textiles, graphics, theater and film design. Early members include [[Eric Gill]], [[Enid Marx]], Sir [[Frank Whittle]] and numerous other household names.\n\n==RSA House==\n[[File:Mathew Taylor on the RSA.ogg|thumb|Audio description of the building by [[Matthew Taylor (Labour politician)|Mathew Taylor]]]]\nThe RSA moved to its current home in 1774. The House, situated in John Adam Street, near [[Strand, London|the Strand]] in central London, had been purpose-designed by the Adam Brothers ([[James Adam (architect)|James Adam]] and [[Robert Adam]]) as part of their innovative [[Adelphi, London|Adelphi]] scheme. The original building (6\u20138 John Adam Street) includes the Great Room, which features a magnificent sequence of paintings by Irish artist [[James Barry (painter)|James Barry]] titled ''The Progress of Human Knowledge and Culture'' and portraits of the Society's first and second presidents, painted by [[Thomas Gainsborough]] and [[Joshua Reynolds]] respectively.\n\nThe RSA has expanded into adjacent buildings, and now includes 2 and 4 John Adam Street and 18 Adam Street. The first occupant of 18 Adam Street was the Adelphi Tavern, which is mentioned in Dickens's ''[[The Pickwick Papers]]''. The former private dining room of the Tavern contains a magnificent Adam ceiling with painted roundels by the school of Kauffman and Zucchi.\n\nA major refurbishment in 2012 by Matthew Lloyd Architects won a [[Royal Institute of British Architects|RIBA]] London Award in 2013, and a RIBA [[English Heritage]] Award for Sustaining the Historic Environment, also in 2013.<ref>[http://www.matthewlloyd.co.uk/projects/the-royal-society-of-arts/ The Royal Society of Arts], Matthew Lloyd Architects.

The first of these plaques was, in fact, of red terracotta erected outside a former residence of [[Lord Byron]] (since demolished). The Society erected 36 plaques until, in 1901, responsibility for them was transferred to the [[London County Council]] (which changed the colour of the plaques to the current blue) and, later, the [[Greater London Council]] (the G.L.C.) and, most recently, English Heritage. Similar schemes are now operated in all the [[Constituent countries of the United Kingdom|constituent countries]] of the [[United Kingdom]].\n\n==Associated organisations==\nThe origin of London's [[Royal Academy of Arts]] lies in an attempt in 1755 by members of the RSA (then simply known as the Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce), principally the sculptor [[Henry Cheere]], to found an autonomous academy of arts to teach painting and sculpture. Prior to this a number of artists were members of the RSA, including Cheere and [[William Hogarth]], or were involved in small-scale private art academies, such as the [[St Martin's Lane Academy]]. Although Cheere's attempt failed, the eventual [[charter]], called an 'Instrument', used to establish the Royal Academy of Arts over a decade later was almost identical to that drawn up by Cheere and the RSA in 1755.<ref>Gordon Sutton, ''Artisan or Artist?: A History of the Teaching of Art and Crafts in English Schools'' (London: Pergamon Press, 2014) p.297</ref> The RSA also hosted the first ''exhibition of contemporary art'' in 1760. Thomas Gainsborough and Joshua Reynolds were among those who exhibited at this first exhibition, and were subsequently founder members of The [[Royal Academy of Arts]] in 1768.\n\nThe Society was a pioneer in examinations, offering the first national public examinations in 1882 that led to the formation of the RSA Examinations Board now included in the [[OCR (examination board)|Oxford, Cambridge and RSA Examinations Board]].\n\nIn 1876, a predecessor of the [[Royal College of Music]], the ''National Training School for Music'', was founded by the RSA.<ref>[https://www.jstor.org/stable/41378132?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents Jstor.Org RSA Journal Vol 140 Page 203, February 1992] Retrieved 19 July 2018</ref>\n\nIn 1929 The Society purchased the entire village of [[West Wycombe]]. After extensive repairs, the village was legally conveyed by deed to the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\nIn 1936, the RSA awarded the first distinctions of [[Royal Designers for Industry]] (RDI or HonRDI), reserved for \"those very few who in the judgment of their peers have achieved 'sustained excellence in aesthetic and efficient design for industry'\".\n\n==Activities==\nIn Great Britain and Ireland, the RSA offers regional activities to encourage Fellows to address local topics of interest and to connect with other Fellows in their locality.

Medals and, in some cases, money were awarded to individuals who achieved success in published challenges within the categories of Agriculture, Polite Arts, Manufacture, Colonies and Trade, Chemistry and Mechanics. Successful submission included agricultural improvements in the cultivation of crops and reforestation, devising new forms of machinery, including an extendable ladder to aid firefighting that has remained in use relatively unchanged, and artistic skill, through submissions by young students, many of whom developed into famous artists e.g. [[Edwin Landseer]] who at the age of 10 was awarded a silver medal for his drawing of a dog.\n\nThe RSA originally specifically precluded premiums for [[patent]]ed solutions.<ref>http://sitoc.biz/adelphicharter/pdfs/RSA_IP_Final.pdf</ref> Today the RSA continues to offer premiums.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thersa.org/action-research-centre/enterprise-and-design/enterprise/premiums|title=RSA Premiums}}</ref>\n\nIn 1936, the RSA awarded the first distinctions of [[Royal Designers for Industry]] (RDI or HonRDI), reserved for \"those very few who in the judgment of their peers have achieved 'sustained excellence in aesthetic and efficient design for industry'\".\n\nIn 1937 \"The Faculty of Royal Designers for Industry\" was established as an association with the object of \"furthering excellence in design and its application to industrial purposes\": membership of the Faculty is automatic for (and exclusive to) all RDIs and HonRDIs. The Faculty currently has 120 Royal Designers (RDI) and 45 Honorary Royal Designers (non-UK citizens who are awarded the accolade of HonRDI): the number of designers who may hold the distinction of RDI at any one time is strictly limited.\n\nThe Faculty consists of the world's leading practitioners from fields as disparate as engineering, furniture, fashion and textiles, graphics, theater and film design. Early members include [[Eric Gill]], [[Enid Marx]], Sir [[Frank Whittle]] and numerous other household names.\n\n==RSA House==\n[[File:Mathew Taylor on the RSA.ogg|thumb|Audio description of the building by [[Matthew Taylor (Labour politician)|Mathew Taylor]]]]\nThe RSA moved to its current home in 1774. The House, situated in John Adam Street, near [[Strand, London|the Strand]] in central London, had been purpose-designed by the Adam Brothers ([[James Adam (architect)|James Adam]] and [[Robert Adam]]) as part of their innovative [[Adelphi, London|Adelphi]] scheme. The original building (6\u20138 John Adam Street) includes the Great Room, which features a magnificent sequence of paintings by Irish artist [[James Barry (painter)|James Barry]] titled ''The Progress of Human Knowledge and Culture'' and portraits of the Society's first and second presidents, painted by [[Thomas Gainsborough]] and [[Joshua Reynolds]] respectively.\n\nThe RSA has expanded into adjacent buildings, and now includes 2 and 4 John Adam Street and 18 Adam Street. The first occupant of 18 Adam Street was the Adelphi Tavern, which is mentioned in Dickens's ''[[The Pickwick Papers]]''. The former private dining room of the Tavern contains a magnificent Adam ceiling with painted roundels by the school of Kauffman and Zucchi.\n\nA major refurbishment in 2012 by Matthew Lloyd Architects won a [[Royal Institute of British Architects|RIBA]] London Award in 2013, and a RIBA [[English Heritage]] Award for Sustaining the Historic Environment, also in 2013.<ref>[http://www.matthewlloyd.co.uk/projects/the-royal-society-of-arts/ The Royal Society of Arts], Matthew Lloyd Architects.

The first of these plaques was, in fact, of red terracotta erected outside a former residence of [[Lord Byron]] (since demolished). The Society erected 36 plaques until, in 1901, responsibility for them was transferred to the [[London County Council]] (which changed the colour of the plaques to the current blue) and, later, the [[Greater London Council]] (the G.L.C.) and, most recently, English Heritage. Similar schemes are now operated in all the [[Constituent countries of the United Kingdom|constituent countries]] of the [[United Kingdom]].\n\n==Associated organisations==\nThe origin of London's [[Royal Academy of Arts]] lies in an attempt in 1755 by members of the RSA (then simply known as the Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce), principally the sculptor [[Henry Cheere]], to found an autonomous academy of arts to teach painting and sculpture. Prior to this a number of artists were members of the RSA, including Cheere and [[William Hogarth]], or were involved in small-scale private art academies, such as the [[St Martin's Lane Academy]]. Although Cheere's attempt failed, the eventual [[charter]], called an 'Instrument', used to establish the Royal Academy of Arts over a decade later was almost identical to that drawn up by Cheere and the RSA in 1755.<ref>Gordon Sutton, ''Artisan or Artist?: A History of the Teaching of Art and Crafts in English Schools'' (London: Pergamon Press, 2014) p.297</ref> The RSA also hosted the first ''exhibition of contemporary art'' in 1760. Thomas Gainsborough and Joshua Reynolds were among those who exhibited at this first exhibition, and were subsequently founder members of The [[Royal Academy of Arts]] in 1768.\n\nThe Society was a pioneer in examinations, offering the first national public examinations in 1882 that led to the formation of the RSA Examinations Board now included in the [[OCR (examination board)|Oxford, Cambridge and RSA Examinations Board]].\n\nIn 1876, a predecessor of the [[Royal College of Music]], the ''National Training School for Music'', was founded by the RSA.<ref>[https://www.jstor.org/stable/41378132?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents Jstor.Org RSA Journal Vol 140 Page 203, February 1992] Retrieved 19 July 2018</ref>\n\nIn 1929 The Society purchased the entire village of [[West Wycombe]]. After extensive repairs, the village was legally conveyed by deed to the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\nIn 1936, the RSA awarded the first distinctions of [[Royal Designers for Industry]] (RDI or HonRDI), reserved for \"those very few who in the judgment of their peers have achieved 'sustained excellence in aesthetic and efficient design for industry'\".\n\n==Activities==\nIn Great Britain and Ireland, the RSA offers regional activities to encourage Fellows to address local topics of interest and to connect with other Fellows in their locality.
