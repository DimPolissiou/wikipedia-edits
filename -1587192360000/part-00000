He grew up in [[Camlough]], [[County Armagh]], and was equally fluent in Irish and English.\n\nIn 1906, when he was 14, Donn-Byrne went to an Irish Volunteer Movement meeting with Bulmer Hobson and Robert Lynd of the London Daily News, where Lynd noticed him, a fair-haired boy, and wrote of his singing. It was through Hobson that Byrne acquired his taste for Irish history and nationalism. (The \"taste for nationalism\" cited, is contested by Bradley. Many may confuse widespread interest in Irish Language and Byrne's excellence in the language, his prizes at feiseanna (festivals) with a more revolutionary political movement engaged in by Hobson and other associates). He attended the [[University of Dublin]], beginning in 1907, where he studied Romance languages and saw his own writing published in ''The National Student'', the student magazine. After graduation he continued his studies in Europe, hoping to join the British Foreign Office. It is related that he \"turned down his PhD\" when he learned that he would have to wear evening clothes to his early morning examinations, which he apparently felt that no true Irish gentleman would ever do. (The latter claim is shown by Bradley to be just one of Byrne's impossible, if entertaining, fantasies)\n\nHe returned to New York in 1911, where he began working first for the publishers of the ''Catholic Encyclopedia'', the ''New Standard Dictionary'', and then the'' Century Dictionary''. In February 1912 his poem \"The Piper\" appeared in ''Harper'''s magazine. His first short story, \"Battle,\" sold soon after to ''Smart Set'' magazine for $50, appearing in the February 1914 issue. He sold more stories; some of these were anthologised in his first book, ''Stories Without Women'', 1915. He then began working on his first novel, ''The Stranger's Banque''t (1919). He was a prolific novelist and short story writer from that point on. His novel ''Field of Honor'' was published posthumously in 1929. His poems were collected into an anthology and published as Poems (1934).\n\nDespite both his wife's success as a playwright, and his own increasing popularity as an author, Byrne's financial straits forced his family to sell their house in Riverside, Connecticut, and return to Ireland. They later purchased Coolmain Castle, near Bandon in County Cork, where Byrne lived until his death in a car accident due to defective steering,<ref>New York Times, 20 June 1928</ref> in June 1928. A Kilbrittain man Cornelius O'Sullivan who witnessed the incident pulled him from the water and tried to revive him, but to no avail. He is buried in Rathclarin churchyard, near Coolmain Castle. His headstone reads, in Irish and English: \"I am in my sleeping and don't waken me.\"<ref>It first appears in ''Ireland: The Rock Whence I Was Hewn'', where Byrne concludes with the following poem:\n\nThe bells of heather/\nHave ceased ringing their Angelus./\nSleepy June weather/\nHas instilled a drug in us.//\n\nThe cry of the plover/\nIs hushed, and the friendly dark/\nHas drawn a blue hood over/\nThe meadow lark.//\n\nWe travel sleeping,/\nOver heather hill and through ferny dale,/\nTo the Land of No Weeping,/\nOf races, and piping and ale.//\n\nHushenn!

(Vol. 51, no. 3, March 1927, page 316).</ref>\n\n== Writings ==\nThe early novels can be said to be quite mediocre, noted as \"[[potboiler]]s\" by Thurston Macauley, Byrne's earliest biographer. ''Messsa Marco Polo'' tells the story of the Italian adventurer as told by an Irishman, and ''The Wind Bloweth'' is a romantic novel of the sea. Both show some highly lyrical passages intermixed with the plain language of real life. With ''Blind Raftery'', however, the author seems to reinvent the saga style, the prose breaking off into musical verse now and then as it tells the story of a blind poet wandering Ireland and avenging his wife's dishonor. A [[List of television operas|television opera]] by [[Joan Trimble]] based on the novel was commissioned and broadcast by the [[BBC]] in 1957.<ref>[https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/page/8fba50823e2e4413b76ff784e78a624a ''Radio Times'' Issue 1749, 19 May 1957, p 6, 17]</ref> \n\nHis later novels invited comparison with Irish novelist [[George Moore (novelist)|George Moore]], especially in their romance and historical themes. It was with ''Hangman's House'', though, that he began to identify himself with the traditional Irish storytellers, noting in his preface (\"A Foreword to Foreigner's\") that: \"I have written a book of Ireland for Irishmen.

His writing hauntingly evokes these images, sometimes seeming want to preserve them. \"It seemed to me,\" he says in ''Wind'', \"that I was capturing for an instant a beauty that was dying slowly, imperceptibly, but would soon be gone.\" His simple narrative style recalls the atmosphere of ancient oral epics such as ''[[Taine Bo Cualinge]]'' and the ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]''.\n\nSome of the works were published in the United Kingdom under different titles.

On a mission on August 12, 1943, he decided to inch closer and closer to within feet of a [[Consolidated B-24 Liberator|B-24]] bomber that was nearby. He was caught in the B-24's prop wash and sucked under its wing, and when he tried to pull away, the tail and fuselage of his airplane was shredded by one of the B-24's propellers, forcing him to bail out.

One of these fighters was flown by ''Major'' [[Wilhelm-Ferdinand Galland|Wilhelm \"Wutz\" Galland]], ''[[Gruppenkommandeur]]'' of II/[[JG 26]], and an ace with some 55 claims to his credit. The next plane that Mahurin received was the third P-47 of his career, and one that would become his primary aircraft; P-47D-5-RE 42-8487. It again bore the squadron codes UN:M and was nicknamed ''The Spirit of [[Atlantic City]], N.J.'' (The aircraft had been \"bought\" courtesy of war bonds purchased (to a value approximately equivalent to the cost of a fighter) by the citizens of Atlantic City, New Jersey. Consequently, the name painted on the aircraft was chosen by Atlantic City.) Mahurin became an ace on October 4 after shooting down three [[Messerschmitt]] [[Messerschmitt Bf 110|Bf 110s]]. Mahurin had his best mission on November 26, 1943, shooting down three Bf 110s, presumably shooting down another, and damaging a fourth to become the first American pilot in the European Theater of Operations to score 10 aerial victories. Mahurin scored two more victories in another aircraft, (P-47D-11-RE 42-75278, coded UN:B<ref name=\"cieldegloire.fr\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cieldegloire.fr/014_mahurin_w_m.php|title=MAHURIN Walker Melville|first=PARRA|last=Laurent|publisher=|accessdate=29 July 2016}}</ref>) on November 29, 1943. On March 8, 1944, he destroyed 3 Fw 190s. He eventually went on to score 19.75 confirmed victories in combat in Europe, with 3 more enemy planes probably destroyed, and one damaged, before being shot down himself.<ref name=\"cieldegloire.fr\"/>\n\nMahurin was promoted to [[Major (United States)|major]] on March 21, 1944. On March 27, his P-47 was heavily damaged by a [[Germans|German]] [[Dornier Flugzeugwerke|Dornier]] [[Dornier Do 217|Do 217]] bomber he helped shoot down, forcing him to bail out. He was picked up by [[French Resistance]] forces. On the night of 3\u20134 May 1944, an RAF [[Westland Lysander]] attempted to retrieve Mahurin from France and fly him back to Britain. Before he could be picked up, the aircraft was shot down, and its pilot killed. The event was watched by Mahurin. The next attempt, again by a Lysander, on the night of May 6\u20137, was successful.<ref>Hugh Verity, ''We Landed by Moonlight'', Crecy Publishing Ltd., 2000, pp. 167, 207, 230  {{ISBN|0947554 75 0}}</ref>  Because of his knowledge of the French Resistance, he was grounded and sent home.<ref name=NYT>{{cite news |title=Bud Mahurin, Fighter Pilot in 2 Wars, Dies at 91 |first=Richard |last=Goldstein |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=May 15, 2010 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/16/us/16mahurin.html}}</ref>\n\nIn October, he again shipped overseas as commander of the 3rd Fighter Squadron, the combat element of the composite 3rd Air Commando Group in the [[Philippines]].

In July 1951, he became commander of the [[1st Operations Group|1st Fighter Group]], training in the [[North American Aviation|North American]] [[F-86 Sabre]]. In December, he began a 90-day tour of temporary duty with the [[51st Fighter Wing|51st Fighter-Interceptor Wing]] at [[Suwon Air Base]], serving as special assistant to the wing commander, Colonel [[Francis S. Gabreski]].\n\nCol. Mahurin helped Gabreski develop tactics and solve logistics problems. He was credited with destroying 3.5 [[MiG-15]]s while TDY with 51st FIW, bringing his total to 23.25 in both World War II and Korea.<ref name=\"cieldegloire.fr\"/> Mahurin transferred to the [[4th Fighter Wing|4th Fighter-Interceptor Wing]] on March 18, 1952, to command its [[4th Operations Group|4th Fighter-Interceptor Group]] at [[Kimpo AB]].\n\nHe flew a F-86E named \"Honest John\" while serving with both fighter wings in Korea.<ref name=\"usfighter.tripod.com\"/>\n\n===Prisoner of war===\nOn May 13, 1952, while strafing a truck, his F-86 was shot down by [[North Korea]]n ground fire and after crash-landing and breaking his arm, he was captured by enemy forces.<ref name=NYT/> Mahurin spent 16 months in a North Korean [[prisoner of war]] (POW) camp.\n\nDuring his time as a prisoner of war, he was confined to a small cell, fed only enough water and food to keep him alive, and subjected to [[Mind control|brainwashing]]. He was forced to endure sub-freezing conditions with minimal clothing, interrogations sometimes lasting all night, and being deprived of sleep and threatened with execution if he did not answer questions.\n\nThe North Koreans were adamant that he sign a confession that he and the [[Allegations of biological warfare in the Korean War|US had waged germ warfare]]. After weeks of psychological and physical torture, Col. Mahurin, believing he was losing control, attempted suicide. He was discovered before he was able to complete the act and barely survived a tremendous loss of blood.<ref name=\"usfighter.tripod.com\"/>\n\nThe interrogators finally gave up, to be replaced by a well-educated Chinese officer who spoke fluent English, brought Mahurin books, arranged for better food, and generally improved his conditions. Eventually, the Chinese officer's real purpose emerged \u2013 to get a [[Allegations of biological warfare in the Korean War|confession of germ warfare]] by persuasion rather than threats.\n\nHe reminded Mahurin that the allies did not know he was a prisoner of war, so he could be held until his death, never to see his wife and children again. Bud Mahurin, at last, agreed to write a \"confession\" so full of inaccuracies and implausible information that any Western reader would know it was fiction. Unknown to him, the war had already ended.<ref name=\"usfighter.tripod.com\"/>\n\nHis experience in enduring brainwashing techniques provided the U.S. with invaluable material to develop survival training courses. Nevertheless, he and other returning prisoners of war were condemned by [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Richard Russell, Jr.]] and others because of their confessions. He was subsequently promoted to full colonel.\n\n==Civilian life==\nAfter his release, Colonel Mahurin was assigned as vice commander of the [[27th Air Division]].<ref name=\"usfighter.tripod.com\"/> Because of his position on the promotion list, it seemed unlikely that he would be promoted to full colonel and be considered for a star and a higher command in his remaining years of service. He therefore resigned his commission in 1956 to accept a senior position with the aircraft industry. Later he joined the Air Force Reserve, subsequently retiring as a Colonel.<ref name=\"usfighter.tripod.com\"/> While the Air Force attributed this to his own choice, stating he was low on the promotion list to colonel and unlikely to make general, a pilot under his command in Korea, Robert Smith, asserts that the Air Force dishonored itself by pressuring Mahurin to resign from the service as a result of political infighting over the confessions, four years short of becoming eligible for retirement benefits.<ref name=\"smitty\">{{cite web |last = |first = |authorlink = |coauthors = |year = |url = http://www.nf104.com/ab/ch_2/ii.html|title = Chapter 2: Aerial Combat|work =  |publisher = Robert W.

Walker M. Mahurin, United States Army Air Forces, for extraordinary heroism in connection with military operations against an armed enemy while serving as Pilot of a P-47 Fighter Airplane in the 63d Fighter Squadron, 56th Fighter Group, EIGHTH Air Force, over enemy occupied continental Europe on 4 October 1943, while serving as flight leader on a mission escorting withdrawing bombers. Though confronted with superior numbers of enemy aircraft and at a disadvantage because of altitude, he vigorously and aggressively attacked the enemy, destroying two planes and assisted in the dispersal of the enemy formation. Immediately thereafter Captain Mahurin chased an enemy fighter far into Germany, where he destroyed it. The heroism displayed by Captain Mahurin on this occasion reflects the highest credit upon himself and the armed forces of the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://valor.militarytimes.com/recipient.php?recipientid=6137|title=Valor awards for Walker Melville Mahurin|publisher=|accessdate=29 July 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://veterantributes.org/TributeDetail.php?recordID=196|title=Veteran Tributes|publisher=|accessdate=29 July 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070211072325/http://www.afa.org/magazine/valor/0297valor.asp Frisbee, John. \"Honest John\", ''Air Force Magazine'', February 1997]\n*Layton, Andrew.

Consequently, the name painted on the aircraft was chosen by Atlantic City.) Mahurin became an ace on October 4 after shooting down three [[Messerschmitt]] [[Messerschmitt Bf 110|Bf 110s]]. Mahurin had his best mission on November 26, 1943, shooting down three Bf 110s, presumably shooting down another, and damaging a fourth to become the first American pilot in the European Theater of Operations to score 10 aerial victories. Mahurin scored two more victories in another aircraft, (P-47D-11-RE 42-75278, coded UN:B<ref name=\"cieldegloire.fr\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cieldegloire.fr/014_mahurin_w_m.php|title=MAHURIN Walker Melville|first=PARRA|last=Laurent|publisher=|accessdate=29 July 2016}}</ref>) on November 29, 1943. On March 8, 1944, he destroyed 3 Fw 190s. He eventually went on to score 19.75 confirmed victories in combat in Europe, with 3 more enemy planes probably destroyed, and one damaged, before being shot down himself.<ref name=\"cieldegloire.fr\"/>\n\nMahurin was promoted to [[Major (United States)|major]] on March 21, 1944. On March 27, his P-47 was heavily damaged by a [[Germans|German]] [[Dornier Flugzeugwerke|Dornier]] [[Dornier Do 217|Do 217]] bomber he helped shoot down, forcing him to bail out. He was picked up by [[French Resistance]] forces. On the night of 3\u20134 May 1944, an RAF [[Westland Lysander]] attempted to retrieve Mahurin from France and fly him back to Britain. Before he could be picked up, the aircraft was shot down, and its pilot killed. The event was watched by Mahurin. The next attempt, again by a Lysander, on the night of May 6\u20137, was successful.<ref>Hugh Verity, ''We Landed by Moonlight'', Crecy Publishing Ltd., 2000, pp. 167, 207, 230  {{ISBN|0947554 75 0}}</ref>  Because of his knowledge of the French Resistance, he was grounded and sent home.<ref name=NYT>{{cite news |title=Bud Mahurin, Fighter Pilot in 2 Wars, Dies at 91 |first=Richard |last=Goldstein |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=May 15, 2010 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/16/us/16mahurin.html}}</ref>\n\nIn October, he again shipped overseas as commander of the 3rd Fighter Squadron, the combat element of the composite 3rd Air Commando Group in the [[Philippines]].

He ended the war with 20.75 confirmed aerial victories and he had the unique distinction of being forced to bail out in both theaters.<ref name=\"usfighter.tripod.com\">{{cite web|url=http://usfighter.tripod.com/maurin.htm|title=walker Mahurin|publisher=|accessdate=29 July 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Korean War==\nAt the start of the Korean War in 1950, Mahurin was serving in the Office of the [[Secretary of the Air Force]]. In July 1951, he became commander of the [[1st Operations Group|1st Fighter Group]], training in the [[North American Aviation|North American]] [[F-86 Sabre]]. In December, he began a 90-day tour of temporary duty with the [[51st Fighter Wing|51st Fighter-Interceptor Wing]] at [[Suwon Air Base]], serving as special assistant to the wing commander, Colonel [[Francis S. Gabreski]].\n\nCol. Mahurin helped Gabreski develop tactics and solve logistics problems. He was credited with destroying 3.5 [[MiG-15]]s while TDY with 51st FIW, bringing his total to 23.25 in both World War II and Korea.<ref name=\"cieldegloire.fr\"/> Mahurin transferred to the [[4th Fighter Wing|4th Fighter-Interceptor Wing]] on March 18, 1952, to command its [[4th Operations Group|4th Fighter-Interceptor Group]] at [[Kimpo AB]].\n\nHe flew a F-86E named \"Honest John\" while serving with both fighter wings in Korea.<ref name=\"usfighter.tripod.com\"/>\n\n===Prisoner of war===\nOn May 13, 1952, while strafing a truck, his F-86 was shot down by [[North Korea]]n ground fire and after crash-landing and breaking his arm, he was captured by enemy forces.<ref name=NYT/> Mahurin spent 16 months in a North Korean [[prisoner of war]] (POW) camp.\n\nDuring his time as a prisoner of war, he was confined to a small cell, fed only enough water and food to keep him alive, and subjected to [[Mind control|brainwashing]], a new brutality unknown to the free world. He was forced to endure sub-freezing conditions with minimal clothing, interrogations sometimes lasting all night, and being deprived of sleep and threatened with execution if he did not answer questions.\n\nThe North Koreans were adamant that he sign a confession that he and the [[Allegations of biological warfare in the Korean War|US had waged germ warfare]]. After weeks of psychological and physical torture, Col. Mahurin, believing he was losing control, attempted suicide. He was discovered before he was able to complete the act and barely survived a tremendous loss of blood.<ref name=\"usfighter.tripod.com\"/>\n\nThe interrogators finally gave up, to be replaced by a well-educated Chinese officer who spoke fluent English, brought Mahurin books, arranged for better food, and generally improved his conditions. Eventually, the Chinese officer's real purpose emerged \u2013 to get a [[Allegations of biological warfare in the Korean War|confession of germ warfare]] by persuasion rather than threats.\n\nHe reminded Mahurin that the allies did not know he was a prisoner of war, so he could be held until his death, never to see his wife and children again. Bud Mahurin, at last, agreed to write a \"confession\" so full of inaccuracies and implausible information that any Western reader would know it was fiction. Unknown to him, the war had already ended.<ref name=\"usfighter.tripod.com\"/>\n\nHis experience in enduring brainwashing techniques provided the U.S. with invaluable material to develop survival training courses. Nevertheless, he and other returning prisoners of war were condemned by [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Richard Russell, Jr.]] and others because of their confessions. He was subsequently promoted to full colonel.\n\n==Civilian life==\nAfter his release, Colonel Mahurin was assigned as vice commander of the [[27th Air Division]].<ref name=\"usfighter.tripod.com\"/> Because of his position on the promotion list, it seemed unlikely that he would be promoted to full colonel and be considered for a star and a higher command in his remaining years of service. He therefore resigned his commission in 1956 to accept a senior position with the aircraft industry. Later he joined the Air Force Reserve, subsequently retiring as a Colonel.<ref name=\"usfighter.tripod.com\"/> While the Air Force attributed this to his own choice, stating he was low on the promotion list to colonel and unlikely to make general, a pilot under his command in Korea, Robert Smith, asserts that the Air Force dishonored itself by pressuring Mahurin to resign from the service as a result of political infighting over the confessions, four years short of becoming eligible for retirement benefits.<ref name=\"smitty\">{{cite web |last = |first = |authorlink = |coauthors = |year = |url = http://www.nf104.com/ab/ch_2/ii.html|title = Chapter 2: Aerial Combat|work =  |publisher = Robert W.

Walker M. Mahurin, United States Army Air Forces, for extraordinary heroism in connection with military operations against an armed enemy while serving as Pilot of a P-47 Fighter Airplane in the 63d Fighter Squadron, 56th Fighter Group, EIGHTH Air Force, over enemy occupied continental Europe on 4 October 1943, while serving as flight leader on a mission escorting withdrawing bombers. Though confronted with superior numbers of enemy aircraft and at a disadvantage because of altitude, he vigorously and aggressively attacked the enemy, destroying two planes and assisted in the dispersal of the enemy formation. Immediately thereafter Captain Mahurin chased an enemy fighter far into Germany, where he destroyed it. The heroism displayed by Captain Mahurin on this occasion reflects the highest credit upon himself and the armed forces of the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://valor.militarytimes.com/recipient.php?recipientid=6137|title=Valor awards for Walker Melville Mahurin|publisher=|accessdate=29 July 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://veterantributes.org/TributeDetail.php?recordID=196|title=Veteran Tributes|publisher=|accessdate=29 July 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070211072325/http://www.afa.org/magazine/valor/0297valor.asp Frisbee, John. \"Honest John\", ''Air Force Magazine'', February 1997]\n*Layton, Andrew.

Police officers Ray Schwill and Bobby Hester were called to the house after which a confrontation ensued and Hester was taken hostage by seven men inside the house. After a 30 hour standoff, [[Memphis Police Department|Memphis Police]] officers stormed the house and opened fire, killing all seven captors, after which Officer Hester was found beaten to death. The police's handling of the incident was controversial and led to changes in Memphis police procedure.<ref name=\"widow\">{{cite web |title=Twenty-five years later, widow remembers Shannon Street |url=http://www.wmcactionnews5.com/story/7900593/twenty-five-years-later-widow-remembers-shannon-street/ |website=www.wmcactionnews5.com |publisher=WMC 5 |accessdate=January 13, 2019 |date=February 20, 2008}}</ref><ref name=\"documentary\">{{cite web |last1=Thompson |first1=April |title=Shannon Street documentary shows how tragedy changed Memphis Police |url=https://wreg.com/2016/04/29/shannon-street-documentary-shows-how-tragedy-changed-memphis-police/ |website=wreg.com |publisher=News Channel 3 |accessdate=January 13, 2019 |date=April 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\n== The incident ==\nOn January 12, 1983, Memphis police were called to 2239 Shannon Street to investigate an alleged purse snatching. Inside the home was Lindberg Sanders-- a man with a history of mental illness and who called himself \"Black Jesus\"-- and seven other men who were his followers. Sanders harbored a strong hatred for law enforcement and had told his followers that the world would end on January 10, 1983. \n\nOfficers Ray Schwill and Bobby Hester responded to the call. Upon arrival Schwill and Hester were ambushed by all seven men in the house. Schwill sustained a gunshot wound to the face and escaped, but Hester was taken hostage. \n\nSchwill radioed for help and police quickly surrounded the house.<ref name=\"documentary\" /><ref name=\"slay cultists\">{{cite web |title=OFFICER KILLED, MEMPHIS POLICE SLAY 7 CULTISTS |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/14/us/officer-killed-memphis-police-slay-7-cultists.html |website=nytimes.com |publisher=[[United Press International]] |accessdate=January 13, 2019 |date=January 14, 1983}}</ref><ref name=\"seven fanatics\">{{cite web |last1=Thorsberg |first1=Frank |title=The seven black religious fanatics who beat to death... |url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1983/01/18/The-seven-black-religious-fanatics-who-beat-to-death/2071610740194/ |website=upi.com |publisher=United Press International |accessdate=January 12, 2019 |date=January 18, 1983}}</ref>\n\nThe first backup officer to arrive attempted to enter the house, but immediately came under fire and was wounded. A second officer entered the house and exchanged gunfire with the cultists. After getting off twelve shots from his service revolver, the officer retreated from the building, retrieved a shotgun, and continued firing into the house. Seven cultists escaped the house during the gun battle, but were captured.\n\nPolice began negotiations with Sanders, who stated that he wanted to broadcast the murder of a police officer over a Memphis radio station and that any attempt by officers to enter the house would result in Officer Hester being beaten to death. Hester could be heard on the police radio begging for help. <ref name=\"documentary\" /><ref name=\"slay cultists\" /><ref name=\"seven fanatics\" /> After 30 hours of negotiations with no resolution, a police SWAT raided the house. During the 20-minute raid, police fired tear gas into the house and made a dynamic entry. At this point, the cultists opened fire on the SWAT team with multiple weapons, including two [[.38 Special|.38-caliber]] service revolvers stolen from Schwill and Hester. The SWAT team returned fire with [[M16 carbine]]s and [[12-gauge]] shotguns, killing all seven cultists, including Sanders.<ref name=\"seven fanatics\" /> Police then discovered the body of Officer Hester, who had been beaten and stabbed to death several hours earlier.<ref name=\"medical examiner\">{{cite web |last1=Thorsberg |first1=Frank |title=A medical examiner said today the policeman slain by... |url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1983/01/14/A-medical-examiner-said-today-the-policeman-slain-by/1292411368400/ |website=upi.com |publisher=United Press International |accessdate=January 13, 2019}}</ref> \n\n=== Deaths ===\n{| border=\"1\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| width=\"200pt\" | '''Name'''\n| width=\"25pt\" | '''Age'''\n|-\n|Lindberg Sanders || 49\n|-\n|Larnell Sanders || 26\n|-\n|Michael Delane Coleman || 18\n|-\n|Earl Thomas || 20\n|-\n|Andrew Houston || 18\n|-\n|David Lee Jordan || 29\n|-\n|Cassell Harris || 21\n|-\n|Officer Robert S.

Officers of the assault team wanted to raid the house once they heard Hester screaming, but police administrators wanted to keep negotiating. By the time they were authorized to raid, Hester had been dead for several hours.<ref name=\"slay cultists\"/>\n\nMembers of Sanders' family and Memphis' [[African-American]] community disputed the police's version of events. Sanders' daughter Lucinda claimed that Officer Schwill had started the confrontation at the house by shoving Lindberg Sanders. Schwill was known to mimic African-American speech when interacting with African-Americans, which could have been taken as an insult.<ref name=\"documentary\" />  Sanders' wife Dorothy alleged that all the men were executed in retaliation for the killing of Hester. Julian Bolton, a [[Shelby County, Tennessee|Shelby County]] Commissioner at the time, criticized the police response as excessive, as he felt that not everyone in house was responsible for Hester's death.

Police officers Ray Schwill and Bobby Hester were called to the house after which a confrontation ensued and Hester was taken hostage by seven men inside the house. After a 30 hour standoff, [[Memphis Police Department|Memphis Police]] officers stormed the house and opened fire, killing all seven captors, after which Officer Hester was found beaten to death. The police's handling of the incident was controversial and led to changes in Memphis police procedure.<ref name=\"widow\">{{cite web |title=Twenty-five years later, widow remembers Shannon Street |url=http://www.wmcactionnews5.com/story/7900593/twenty-five-years-later-widow-remembers-shannon-street/ |website=www.wmcactionnews5.com |publisher=WMC 5 |accessdate=January 13, 2019 |date=February 20, 2008}}</ref><ref name=\"documentary\">{{cite web |last1=Thompson |first1=April |title=Shannon Street documentary shows how tragedy changed Memphis Police |url=https://wreg.com/2016/04/29/shannon-street-documentary-shows-how-tragedy-changed-memphis-police/ |website=wreg.com |publisher=News Channel 3 |accessdate=January 13, 2019 |date=April 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\n== The incident ==\nOn January 12, 1983, Memphis police were called to 2239 Shannon Street to investigate an alleged purse snatching. Inside the home was Lindberg Sanders-- a man with a history of mental illness and who called himself \"Black Jesus\"-- and seven other men who were his followers. Sanders harbored a strong hatred for law enforcement and had told his followers that the world would end on January 10, 1983. \n\nOfficers Ray Schwill and Bobby Hester responded to the call. Upon arrival Schwill and Hester were ambushed by all seven men in the house. Schwill sustained a gunshot wound to the face and escaped, but Hester was taken hostage. \n\nSchwill radioed for help and police quickly surrounded the house.<ref name=\"documentary\" /><ref name=\"slay cultists\">{{cite web |title=OFFICER KILLED, MEMPHIS POLICE SLAY 7 CULTISTS |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/14/us/officer-killed-memphis-police-slay-7-cultists.html |website=nytimes.com |publisher=[[United Press International]] |accessdate=January 13, 2019 |date=January 14, 1983}}</ref><ref name=\"seven fanatics\">{{cite web |last1=Thorsberg |first1=Frank |title=The seven black religious fanatics who beat to death... |url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1983/01/18/The-seven-black-religious-fanatics-who-beat-to-death/2071610740194/ |website=upi.com |publisher=United Press International |accessdate=January 12, 2019 |date=January 18, 1983}}</ref>\n\nThe first backup officer to arrive attempted to enter the house, but immediately came under fire and was wounded. A second officer entered the house and exchanged gunfire with the cultists. After getting off twelve shots from his service revolver, the officer retreated from the building, retrieved a shotgun, and continued firing into the house. Seven cultists escaped the house during the gun battle, but were captured.\n\nPolice began negotiations with Sanders, who stated that he wanted to broadcast the murder of a police officer over a Memphis radio station and that any attempt by officers to enter the house would result in Officer Hester being beaten to death. Hester could be heard on the police radio begging for help. <ref name=\"documentary\" /><ref name=\"slay cultists\" /><ref name=\"seven fanatics\" /> After 30 hours of negotiations with no resolution, a police SWAT raided the house. During the 20-minute raid, police fired tear gas into the house and made a dynamic entry. At this point, the cultists opened fire on the SWAT team with multiple weapons, including two [[.38 Special|.38-caliber]] service revolvers stolen from Schwill and Hester. The SWAT team returned fire with [[M16 carbine]]s and [[12-gauge]] shotguns, killing all seven cultists, including Sanders.<ref name=\"seven fanatics\" /> Police then discovered the body of Officer Hester, who had been beaten and stabbed to death several hours earlier.<ref name=\"medical examiner\">{{cite web |last1=Thorsberg |first1=Frank |title=A medical examiner said today the policeman slain by... |url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1983/01/14/A-medical-examiner-said-today-the-policeman-slain-by/1292411368400/ |website=upi.com |publisher=United Press International |accessdate=January 13, 2019}}</ref> \n\n=== Deaths ===\n{| border=\"1\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| width=\"200pt\" | '''Name'''\n| width=\"25pt\" | '''Age'''\n|-\n|Lindberg Sanders || 49\n|-\n|Larnell Sanders || 26\n|-\n|Michael Delane Coleman || 18\n|-\n|Earl Thomas || 20\n|-\n|Andrew Houston || 18\n|-\n|David Lee Jordan || 29\n|-\n|Cassell Harris || 21\n|-\n|Officer Robert S.

Officers of the assault team wanted to raid the house once they heard Hester screaming, but police administrators wanted to keep negotiating. By the time they were authorized to raid, Hester had been dead for several hours.<ref name=\"slay cultists\"/>\n\nMembers of Sanders' family and Memphis' [[African-American]] community disputed the police's version of events. Sanders' daughter Lucinda claimed that Officer Schwill had started the confrontation at the house by shoving Lindberg Sanders. Schwill was known to mimic African-American speech when interacting with African-Americans, which could have been taken as an insult.<ref name=\"documentary\" />  Sanders' wife Dorothy alleged that all the men were executed in retaliation for the killing of Hester. Julian Bolton, a [[Shelby County, Tennessee|Shelby County]] Commissioner at the time, criticized the police response as excessive, as he felt that not everyone in house was responsible for Hester's death. Bolton also noted how six of the seven captors were shot in the head and that their bodies were photographed lying next to each other, which Bolton stated indicates that they were shot execution-style. A [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] investigation found no wrongdoing on the part of the police.<ref name=\"widow\" />\n\nAfter the incident, Memphis Police adopted a policy of immediate raids for hostage situations if a hostage has been injured. Memphis Police also implemented more training on how to de-escalate crisis situations, particularly with mentally ill subjects.<ref name=\"documentary\" />\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Shannon Street massacre}}\n[[Category:1983 murders in the United States]]\n[[Category:1983 in Tennessee]]\n[[Category:African-American history of Tennessee]]\n[[Category:Armed standoffs in the United States]]\n[[Category:Deaths by firearm in Tennessee]]\n[[Category:History of Memphis, Tennessee]]\n[[Category:January 1983 events in the United States]]\n[[Category:People shot dead by law enforcement officers in the United States]]\n", "name_user": "Base0x10", "label": "safe", "comment": "Remove trailing close bracket", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shannon_Street_massacre"}
