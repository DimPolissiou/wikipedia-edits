The NMR and MS study by Zjawiony suggested that the biosynthesis of salvinorin A proceeds via the 1-deoxy-d-xylulose-5-phosphate pathway. In the deoxyxylulose phosphate pathway, D-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate and pyruvate, the intermediates of the glycolysis, are converted into 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate via decarboxylation. Subsequent reduction with NADPH generates 2C-methyl-D-erythritol 2,4-cyclodiphosphate, via the intermediates 4-diphosphocytidyl-2-C-methyl-D-erythritol and 4-diphosphocytidyl-2c-methyl-d-erythritol-2-phosphate, which then lead to IPP and DMAPP.\n\n[[File:Synthesis of IPP and DMAPP via 1-deoxy-d-xylulose-5-phosphate Pathway.png|thumb|Synthesis of IPP and DMAPP via 1-deoxy-d-xylulose-5-phosphate Pathway]]\n\nSubsequent addition of three 5-carbon IPP units to a single 5-carbon DMAPP unit generates the 20-carbon central precursor, [[geranylgeranyl diphosphate]] (GGPP).

It has a population of about 1,200 (2001), shown in the 2011 Census as being included in the population of [[Chapel-en-le-Frith]].  It straddles the [[A6 road (England)|A6 road]] approximately three miles north of [[Buxton]] and three miles south of Chapel-en-le-Frith. Trains run from [[Dove Holes railway station]] into [[Manchester]].\n\nResidents of the village live either in the village or on outlying farms. There are around six farms in the village and many more within the boundaries of the parish. There are also large limestone quarries that, over the years, have made an important contribution to the development and economy of the village. Additionally, there are several businesses. There are two [[public house]]s, one of which offers accommodation. There is a daily milk delivery service and a mobile library every fortnight. There is a church, Methodist chapel and a community centre. The village lies on the fringe of the [[Peak District National Park]].\n\nEvidence of human occupation at Dove Holes can be traced back to the [[Neolithic]] Period (late [[Stone Age]]) because of the existence of a [[henge]], known locally as [[The Bull Ring]], and an adjoining [[tumulus]]. In [[medieval]] times the area was used as the royal hunting [[Forest of High Peak]] (now known as [[Peak Forest]]), an area set aside as a [[Royal forest|royal hunting forest]]. The village's name is believed to derive from the Celtic word ''dwfr'' (d\u0175r in [[Welsh language|modern Welsh]]), which means water, hence Water Holes or Dove Holes. The same word is the origin of the name '[[Dover]]' for the famous [[English Channel|Channel]] ferryport.\n\nIn 1650, a General Survey of the Manor of High Peak was made to assess the property of the late [[Charles I of England|King Charles]]. This recorded that people were burning limestone around the village and that there were 14 kilns thereabouts, the burnt lime (quicklime) being slaked and used by farmers to condition the soil in their fields. At that time, lime kilns could be built and demolished without authority.\n\nWith the coming of the [[Industrial Revolution]], and the opening of the [[Peak Forest Tramway]] in 1796, the limestone quarries were commercialised. The first of these was at nearby Loads Knowl and others quickly followed along Dove Holes Dale. Undoubtedly, the opening of the Peak Forest Tramway and the consequent expansion of commercial limestone quarries contributed greatly to the expansion of the village. For the first time, there was an outlet for limestone in Manchester via the Peak Forest Tramway, [[Bugsworth Basin]], the [[Peak Forest Canal]] and the [[Ashton Canal]].\n\nBuxton Mountain Rescue Team has been based in Dove Holes since the 1970s.
