His body was not recovered until November of that year.\n* On October 21, 9-year-old '''Yusuf Bell''' went to a store to buy Bruton [[Snuff (tobacco)|snuff]] for a neighbor, Eula Birdsong, at Reese Grocery on McDaniel Street. A witness said she saw Yusuf near the intersection of McDaniel and Fulton getting into a blue car before he disappeared. His body was found on November 8 in the abandoned E. P. Johnson Elementary School by a school janitor who was looking for a place to urinate. Bell's body was found clothed in the brown cut-off shorts he was last seen wearing, though they had a piece of [[masking tape]] stuck to them. He had been hit over the head twice, and the cause of death was strangulation. Police did not immediately link his disappearance to the previous killings.\n\n'''1980'''\n* On March 4, 1980, the first female victim, 12-year-old '''Angel Lanier''', disappeared. She left her house around 4 p.m., wearing a denim outfit, and was last seen at a friend's house watching the television program ''[[Sanford and Son]]''. Lenair's body was found six days later, in a wooded vacant lot along Campbellton Road, wearing the same clothes in which she had left home. A pair of white panties that did not belong to Lenair were stuffed in her mouth, and her hands were bound with an electrical cord. The cause of death was strangulation.<ref>[https://www.amazon.com/Atlanta-Murders-Politics-Johnson-Criminology/dp/0809323192/ \"The Atlanta Youth Murders and the Politics of Race\"] Bernard D. Headley, Published by Southern Illinois University Press, December 1, 1999</ref>\n* On March 11, one week after Lenair's disappearance, 11-year-old '''Jeffery Mathis''' disappeared while on an errand for his mother. He was wearing gray jogging pants, brown shoes, and a white and green shirt. Months later a girl said she saw him get into a blue car with a light-skinned man and a dark-skinned man. The body of Jeffrey Mathis was found in a \"briar-covered patch of woodlands,\" 11 months after he disappeared, by which time it was not possible to identify a cause of death.\n* On May 18, 14-year-old '''Eric Middlebrooks''' disappeared. He was last seen answering the telephone at home and then leaving in a hurry on his bicycle, taking with him a hammer to repair the bicycle. His body was found the following day next to his bicycle in the rear garage of an Atlanta bar. The bar was located next door to what was then the Georgia Department of Offender Rehabilitation. His pockets were turned inside out, his chest and arms had slight stab wounds, and the cause of death was determined to be blunt force trauma to the head. A few weeks before he disappeared, Middlebrooks had testified against three juveniles in a robbery case.\n* On June 9, 12-year-old '''Christopher Richardson''' went missing on his way to a local pool. He was last seen walking towards the DeKalb County's Midway Recreation Center in Midway Park. He was wearing blue shorts, a light blue shirt, and blue tennis shoes. His body was not found until the following January, clothed in unfamiliar swim trunks, along with the body of a later victim, Earl Terrell. The cause of Richardson's death was not determined.\n* On June 22, 7-year-old '''LaTonya Wilson''' disappeared from her parents' apartment. According to a witness, she appeared to have been abducted by two men, one of whom was seen climbing into the apartment window and then holding Wilson in his arms as he spoke to the other man in the parking lot. On October 18, Wilson's body was found in a fenced-in area at the end of Verbena Street in Atlanta. By then, the body had skeletonized, and no cause of death could be established.\n* The next day, June 23, 10-year-old '''Aaron Wyche''' disappeared after having been seen near a local grocery store, getting into a blue [[Chevrolet]] with either one or two black men. A female witness says she saw Wyche being led from Tanner's Corner Grocery by a 6-foot-tall 180-pound black male, approximately 30 years old, with a mustache and goatee. The witness's description of the car matched a description of a similar car implicated in the earlier Jeffrey Mathis disappearance. At 6 p.m., Wyche was seen at a shopping center. The following day, Wyche's body was found under a bridge; the official cause of death was asphyxiation from a broken neck suffered in a fall.\n* In July 1980, two more children, '''Anthony Carter''' and '''Earl Terrell''', were murdered.\n* Between August and November 1980, '''five more killings''' took place. All the victims were African-American children, between the ages of 7 and 14, and most were killed via asphyxiation.\n\n'''1981'''\n* The murders continued into 1981. The first known victim in the new year was '''Lubie Geter''', who disappeared on January 3. Geter's body was found on February 5.\n* Geter's friend '''Terry Pue''' went missing in January. An anonymous caller told the police where to find Pue's body.<ref>[http://www.crimelibrary.com/serial_killers/predators/williams/15.html \"Famous Atlanta Child Murders & Wayne Williams\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060527110152/http://www.crimelibrary.com/serial_killers/predators/williams/15.html |date=May 27, 2006 }}, ''The Crime Library''</ref>.  Terry lived in the same apartment as Edward \"Teddy\" Smith, who was killed in 1979. \n* In February and March 1981, six more bodies were discovered, believed to be linked to the previous homicides. Among the dead was the body of '''Eddie Duncan''', the first adult victim.\n* In April, 20-year-old '''Larry Rogers''', 28-year-old '''John Porter''', and 21-year-old '''Jimmy Ray Payne''' were murdered. Porter and Payne were ex-convicts and had just recently been released from [[Arrendale State Prison]] after serving time for burglary.\n* On May 12, 1981, FBI agents found the body of 17-year-old '''William \"Billy Star\" Barrett''' on a curb in a wooded area near his home. A witness, 32-year-old Harold Wood, a custodian from Southwest High School, had run out of gas about a mile from the scene. Wood described a black man standing over and observing the location where the body was found before driving away in a white-over-blue Cadillac.\n* During the end of May 1981, the last reported victim was added to the list: 27-year-old '''Nathaniel Cater'''. He was last seen by gardener Robert I. Henry at the entrance of the Rialto Theatre in Atlanta, reportedly holding hands with Wayne Williams. His body was discovered just hours later.\n* Investigator Chet Dettlinger created a map of the victims' locations. Despite the difference in ages, the victims fell within the same geographic parameters. They were connected to Memorial Drive and 11 major streets in the area.\n\n==Capturing the suspect==\n[[File:Wayne-Williams-Mugshot.jpg|thumb|250px|A mugshot of [[Wayne Bertram Williams|Wayne Williams]] taken after his arrest.]]\nDuring the murders, more than 100 agents were working on the investigation.<ref name=\"nyt-april-2019\"/> The city of Atlanta imposed curfews, and parents in the city removed their children from school and forbade them from playing outside.<ref name=\"nyt-april-2019\"/>\n\nAs the media coverage of the killings intensified, the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] predicted that the killer might dump the next victim into a body of water to conceal any evidence. Police staked out nearly a dozen area bridges, including crossings of the [[Chattahoochee River]]. During a [[stakeout]] on May 22, 1981, detectives got their first major break when an officer heard a splash beneath a bridge. Another officer saw a white 1970 [[Chevrolet]] [[station wagon]] turn around and drive back across the bridge.<ref name=\"autogenerated1982\">[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,921098,00.html WALTER ISAACSON;Anne Constable, \"A Web of Fiber and Fact\"], ''Time'' Magazine, 8 March 1982, accessed 27 Nov 2009</ref>\n\nTwo police cars later stopped the suspect station wagon about a half-mile from the bridge.  The driver was 23-year-old [[Wayne Bertram Williams]], a supposed [[music promoter]] and [[freelance]] [[photographer]].<ref name=\"autogenerated1982\"/> The Chevrolet wagon belonged to his parents. Dog hair and fibers recovered from the rear of the vehicle were later used as evidence in the case against Williams, as similar fibers were found on some of the victims. They were found to match his dog and the carpet in his parents' house. During questioning, Williams said he was on his way to audition a woman, Cheryl Johnson, as a singer.  Williams claimed she lived in the nearby town of [[Smyrna, Georgia|Smyrna]]. Police did not find any record of her or the appointment.\n\nTwo days later, on May 24, the nude body of Nathaniel Cater, 27, was found floating downriver a few miles from the bridge where police had seen the suspicious station wagon.<ref name=\"autogenerated1982\"/> Based on this evidence, including the police officer's hearing of the splash, police believed that Williams had killed Cater and disposed of his body while the police were nearby.\n\nInvestigators who stopped Williams on the bridge noticed gloves and a 24-inch nylon cord sitting in the passenger seat. According to investigators, the cord looked similar to ligature marks found on Cater and other victims, but the cord was never taken into evidence for analysis. Adding to a growing list of suspicious circumstances, Williams had handed out flyers in predominantly black neighborhoods calling for young people ages 11\u201321 to audition for his new singing group that he called Gemini. Williams failed an FBI-administered polygraph examination, though polygraph results are not admissible as evidence in criminal courts.<ref>{{cite web|first1=Jim|last1=Polk|first2=Christina|last2=Zdanowicz|url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/CRIME/06/11/atlanta.murders.poll.ireport/|title=CNN viewers: Williams 'guilty' in Atlanta child murders|work=[[CNN]]|location=Atlanta, Georgia|date=September 6, 2010|accessdate=September 8, 2014}}</ref>\n\nFibers from a carpet in the Williams residence were found to match those observed on two of the victims.<ref name=\"nyt-april-2019\"/> Additional fibers from the Williams's home, vehicles, and pet dog were later matched to fibers discovered on other victims.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=px18mE2gR-0C Trace Evidence: Dead People Do Tell Tales] By Stephen Eldridge Enslow Publishers, Inc., 1 July 2011 pg39-49</ref> Furthermore, witness Robert Henry claimed to have seen Williams holding hands and walking with Nathaniel Cater on the night Cater is believed to have died.<ref>[http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1107/04/se.02.html \"CNN Transcripts: Atlanta Child Murders]</ref>\n\nOn June 21, 1981, Williams was arrested.

This was widely reported as the FBI effectively declaring Williams guilty, and Douglas was officially censured by the Director of the FBI.<ref>MindHunter Pg 215</ref>\n\n==Trial==\nJury selection began on December 28, 1981, and lasted six days. Nine women and three men comprised the jury, among them eight African Americans and four Caucasians.\n\nThe trial officially began on January 6, 1982, with [[Clarence Cooper (judge)|Judge Clarence Cooper]] presiding. The most important evidence against Williams was the fiber analysis between the victims Williams was indicted for, Jimmy Ray Payne and Nathaniel Cater, and the 12 pattern-murder cases in which circumstantial evidence culminated in numerous links among the crimes. This included witnesses testifying to seeing Williams with the victims, and some witnesses suggesting that he had solicited sexual favors.<ref name=\"autogenerated1982\"/>\n\nThe prosecution's presentation of the case has been criticized, to the extent that in some jurisdictions it might have resulted in a mistrial. In particular, two separate FBI special agents testified that the chances of the victims not having come into contact with Williams was \"virtually impossible,\" based only on the comparative rarity of the fibers found on the victims that seemed to match the suspect's car and home.<ref>[http://scholarworks.gsu.edu/gsulr/vol1/iss1/9/ Johnson, J.

Graham, one of the original investigators in these cases, said he doubted that Wayne Williams, the man convicted of two of the killings and blamed for 22 others, was guilty of all of them.<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ZPsrAAAAIBAJ&sjid=N20FAAAAIBAJ&pg=2866%2C3196741 \"Police chief behind probe in new killings resigns\"], Kentucky New Era, May 4, 2006</ref> On June 21, 2006, the DeKalb County Police dropped its reinvestigation of the Atlanta child murders.

Sanders of the [[KKK]] once praised the crimes in secretly recorded conversations. Although Sanders did not claim responsibility for any of the deaths, lawyers for Williams believed that the evidence would help their bid for a new trial for Williams. (The police had investigated Sanders in relation to the murders, but dropped the probe into his and the KKK's possible involvement after Sanders was kept under close surveillance for seven weeks, during which four more victims were killed, and after Sanders and two of his brothers volunteered for and passed [[lie detector]] tests.){{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nCriminal [[Criminal profiler|profiler]] [[John E.

This decision was a response to a legal filing as a part of Williams' efforts to appeal his conviction and life sentences. Williams' lawyer, Jack Martin, asked a Fulton County Superior Court judge to allow DNA tests on canine and human hair and blood, stating the results might help Williams win a new trial.\n\nOn June 26, 2007, the DNA test results showed that the hairs on the bodies contained the same mitochondrial DNA sequence as Williams' dog\u2014a sequence that occurs in only about 1 out of 100 dogs. Dr. Elizabeth Wictum, director of the [[UC Davis]] laboratory that carried out the testing, told ''The Associated Press'' that while the results were \u201cfairly significant,\u201d they \"don't conclusively point to Williams' dog as the source of the hair\" because the lab was able to test only for [[mitochondrial DNA]], which, unlike [[nuclear DNA]], cannot be shown to be unique to one dog.<ref>[http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/nation/20070626-1055-atlantachildkillings.html \"DA, defense spar over meaning of new DNA test on dog hairs in Atlanta child murder case\"], Sign on San Diego, ''The San Diego Union-Tribune'', 26 Jun 2007</ref>\n\nLater in 2007, the FBI performed DNA tests on two human hairs found on one of the victims. The mitochondrial DNA sequence in the hairs would eliminate 99.5% of persons by not matching their DNA.

In the series fictional treatment, Agent Ford has the role of insisting that the 13 murders (at the time of the series arc) they are investigating are the work of one single serial killer, and that to gain the victims' trust, he may be African-American himself. This line of deduction clashes with that of his colleague Agent Tench, the Atlanta Police Department, and the African-American community of Atlanta\u2013many of whom believe, in light of Georgia's history of hate crimes and racial violence, that the killings are the work of the Ku Klux Klan.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vulture.com/2019/09/mindhunter-john-douglas-atlanta-child-murders.html|title=The Real FBI Agent Behind Mindhunter on What Actually Happened in Atlanta|last=Sherer|first=Devon|date=September 6, 2019|website=Vulture|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-09-10}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vulture.com/2019/08/mindhunter-atlanta-child-murders-true-story.html|title=The True Story Behind Mindhunter\u2019s Atlanta Child Murders|last=Tallerico|first=Brian|date=August 30, 2019|website=Vulture|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=September 10, 2019}}</ref>\n\n''The Atlanta Child Murders'', a three-part documentary series produced by [[Will Packer Productions]], aired on [[Investigation Discovery]] in March 2019.<ref>{{cite web|last=White |first=Peter |url=https://deadline.com/2019/02/atlanta-child-murders-will-packer-id-1202555528/ |title=Will Packer To Produce \u2018The Atlanta Child Murders\u2019 For ID |publisher=Deadline |date=2019-02-12 |accessdate=2019-03-02}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Post\u2013civil rights era in African-American history|Post-civil rights era African-American history]]\n* ''[[Leaving Atlanta]]'', a 2002 novel based on the murders\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* [[Robert D.

Over the two-year period, at least 28 children, [[adolescents]], and adults were killed.\n\n[[Wayne Williams]], an Atlanta native who was 23 years old at the time of the last murder, was arrested, tried, and convicted of two of the adult murders and sentenced to two consecutive life terms. Police subsequently have attributed a number of the child murders to Williams, although he has not been charged in any of those cases, and Williams himself maintains his innocence, although the killings ceased after his arrest. In March 2019, the [[Atlanta Police Department|Atlanta police]], under the order of Mayor [[Keisha Lance Bottoms]], reopened the cases in hopes that new technology will lead to a conviction.<ref name=\"nyt-april-2019\">{{cite web |last1=Burch |first1=Audra D.

Their bodies were found on July 28 in a wooded area,<ref name=\"nyt-april-2019\" /> Smith with a .22 caliber gunshot wound in his upper back. They were believed to be the first victims of the putative \"Atlanta Child Killer\".\n* On September 4, the next victim, 14-year-old '''Milton Harvey''', disappeared while on an errand to the bank for his mother. He was riding a yellow 10-speed bike, which was found a week later in a remote area of Atlanta. His body was not recovered until November of that year.\n* On October 21, 9-year-old '''Yusuf Bell''' went to a store to buy Bruton [[Snuff (tobacco)|snuff]] for a neighbor, Eula Birdsong, at Reese Grocery on McDaniel Street. A witness said she saw Yusuf near the intersection of McDaniel and Fulton getting into a blue car before he disappeared. His body was found on November 8 in the abandoned E. P. Johnson Elementary School by a school janitor who was looking for a place to urinate. Bell's body was found clothed in the brown cut-off shorts he was last seen wearing, though they had a piece of [[masking tape]] stuck to them. He had been hit over the head twice, and the cause of death was strangulation. Police did not immediately link his disappearance to the previous killings.\n\n'''1980'''\n* On March 4, 1980, the first female victim, 12-year-old '''Angel Lanier''', disappeared. She left her house around 4 p.m., wearing a denim outfit, and was last seen at a friend's house watching the television program ''[[Sanford and Son]]''. Lenair's body was found six days later, in a wooded vacant lot along Campbellton Road, wearing the same clothes in which she had left home. A pair of white panties that did not belong to Lenair were stuffed in her mouth, and her hands were bound with an electrical cord. The cause of death was strangulation.<ref>[https://www.amazon.com/Atlanta-Murders-Politics-Johnson-Criminology/dp/0809323192/ \"The Atlanta Youth Murders and the Politics of Race\"] Bernard D. Headley, Published by Southern Illinois University Press, December 1, 1999</ref>\n* On March 11, one week after Lenair's disappearance, 11-year-old '''Jeffery Mathis''' disappeared while on an errand for his mother. He was wearing gray jogging pants, brown shoes, and a white and green shirt. Months later a girl said she saw him get into a blue car with a light-skinned man and a dark-skinned man. The body of Jeffrey Mathis was found in a \"briar-covered patch of woodlands,\" 11 months after he disappeared, by which time it was not possible to identify a cause of death.\n* On May 18, 14-year-old '''Eric Middlebrooks''' disappeared. He was last seen answering the telephone at home and then leaving in a hurry on his bicycle, taking with him a hammer to repair the bicycle. His body was found the following day next to his bicycle in the rear garage of an Atlanta bar. The bar was located next door to what was then the Georgia Department of Offender Rehabilitation. His pockets were turned inside out, his chest and arms had slight stab wounds, and the cause of death was determined to be blunt force trauma to the head. A few weeks before he disappeared, Middlebrooks had testified against three juveniles in a robbery case.\n* On June 9, 12-year-old '''Christopher Richardson''' went missing on his way to a local pool. He was last seen walking towards the DeKalb County's Midway Recreation Center in Midway Park. He was wearing blue shorts, a light blue shirt, and blue tennis shoes. His body was not found until the following January, clothed in unfamiliar swim trunks, along with the body of a later victim, Earl Terrell. The cause of Richardson's death was not determined.\n* On June 22, 7-year-old '''LaTonya Wilson''' disappeared from her parents' apartment. According to a witness, she appeared to have been abducted by two men, one of whom was seen climbing into the apartment window and then holding Wilson in his arms as he spoke to the other man in the parking lot. On October 18, Wilson's body was found in a fenced-in area at the end of Verbena Street in Atlanta. By then, the body had skeletonized, and no cause of death could be established.\n* The next day, June 23, 10-year-old '''Aaron Wyche''' disappeared after having been seen near a local grocery store, getting into a blue [[Chevrolet]] with either one or two black men. A female witness says she saw Wyche being led from Tanner's Corner Grocery by a 6-foot-tall 180-pound black male, approximately 30 years old, with a mustache and goatee. The witness's description of the car matched a description of a similar car implicated in the earlier Jeffrey Mathis disappearance. At 6 p.m., Wyche was seen at a shopping center. The following day, Wyche's body was found under a bridge; the official cause of death was asphyxiation from a broken neck suffered in a fall.\n* In July 1980, two more children, '''Anthony Carter''' and '''Earl Terrell''', were murdered.\n* Between August and November 1980, '''five more killings''' took place. All the victims were African-American children, between the ages of 7 and 14, and most were killed via asphyxiation.\n\n'''1981'''\n* The murders continued into 1981. The first known victim in the new year was '''Lubie Geter''', who disappeared on January 3. Geter's body was found on February 5.\n* Geter's friend '''Terry Pue''' went missing in January. An anonymous caller told the police where to find Pue's body.<ref>[http://www.crimelibrary.com/serial_killers/predators/williams/15.html \"Famous Atlanta Child Murders & Wayne Williams\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060527110152/http://www.crimelibrary.com/serial_killers/predators/williams/15.html |date=May 27, 2006 }}, ''The Crime Library''</ref>.  Terry lived in the same apartment as Edward \"Teddy\" Smith, who was killed in 1979. \n* In February and March 1981, six more bodies were discovered, believed to be linked to the previous homicides. Among the dead was the body of '''Eddie Duncan''', the first adult victim.\n* In April, 20-year-old '''Larry Rogers''', 28-year-old '''John Porter''', and 21-year-old '''Jimmy Ray Payne''' were murdered. Porter and Payne were ex-convicts and had just recently been released from [[Arrendale State Prison]] after serving time for burglary.\n* On May 12, 1981, FBI agents found the body of 17-year-old '''William \"Billy Star\" Barrett''' on a curb in a wooded area near his home. A witness, 32-year-old Harold Wood, a custodian from Southwest High School, had run out of gas about a mile from the scene. Wood described a black man standing over and observing the location where the body was found before driving away in a white-over-blue Cadillac.\n* During the end of May 1981, the last reported victim was added to the list: 27-year-old '''Nathaniel Cater'''. He was last seen by gardener Robert I. Henry at the entrance of the Rialto Theatre in Atlanta, reportedly holding hands with Wayne Williams. His body was discovered just hours later.\n* Investigator Chet Dettlinger created a map of the victims' locations. Despite the difference in ages, the victims fell within the same geographic parameters. They were connected to Memorial Drive and 11 major streets in the area.\n\n==Capturing the suspect==\n[[File:Wayne-Williams-Mugshot.jpg|thumb|250px|A mugshot of [[Wayne Bertram Williams|Wayne Williams]] taken after his arrest.]]\nDuring the murders, more than 100 agents were working on the investigation.<ref name=\"nyt-april-2019\"/> The city of Atlanta imposed curfews, and parents in the city removed their children from school and forbade them from playing outside.<ref name=\"nyt-april-2019\"/>\n\nAs the media coverage of the killings intensified, the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] predicted that the killer might dump the next victim into a body of water to conceal any evidence. Police staked out nearly a dozen area bridges, including crossings of the [[Chattahoochee River]]. During a [[stakeout]] on May 22, 1981, detectives got their first major break when an officer heard a splash beneath a bridge. Another officer saw a white 1970 [[Chevrolet]] [[station wagon]] turn around and drive back across the bridge.<ref name=\"autogenerated1982\">[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,921098,00.html WALTER ISAACSON;Anne Constable, \"A Web of Fiber and Fact\"], ''Time'' Magazine, 8 March 1982, accessed 27 Nov 2009</ref>\n\nTwo police cars later stopped the suspect station wagon about a half-mile from the bridge.  The driver was 23-year-old [[Wayne Bertram Williams]], a supposed [[music promoter]] and [[freelance]] [[photographer]].<ref name=\"autogenerated1982\"/> The Chevrolet wagon belonged to his parents. Dog hair and fibers recovered from the rear of the vehicle were later used as evidence in the case against Williams, as similar fibers were found on some of the victims. They were found to match his dog and the carpet in his parents' house. During questioning, Williams said he was on his way to audition a woman, Cheryl Johnson, as a singer.  Williams claimed she lived in the nearby town of [[Smyrna, Georgia|Smyrna]]. Police did not find any record of her or the appointment.\n\nTwo days later, on May 24, the nude body of Nathaniel Cater, 27, was found floating downriver a few miles from the bridge where police had seen the suspicious station wagon.<ref name=\"autogenerated1982\"/> Based on this evidence, including the police officer's hearing of the splash, police believed that Williams had killed Cater and disposed of his body while the police were nearby.\n\nInvestigators who stopped Williams on the bridge noticed gloves and a 24-inch nylon cord sitting in the passenger seat. According to investigators, the cord looked similar to ligature marks found on Cater and other victims, but the cord was never taken into evidence for analysis. Adding to a growing list of suspicious circumstances, Williams had handed out flyers in predominantly black neighborhoods calling for young people ages 11\u201321 to audition for his new singing group that he called Gemini. Williams failed an FBI-administered polygraph examination, though polygraph results are not admissible as evidence in criminal courts.<ref>{{cite web|first1=Jim|last1=Polk|first2=Christina|last2=Zdanowicz|url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/CRIME/06/11/atlanta.murders.poll.ireport/|title=CNN viewers: Williams 'guilty' in Atlanta child murders|work=[[CNN]]|location=Atlanta, Georgia|date=September 6, 2010|accessdate=September 8, 2014}}</ref>\n\nFibers from a carpet in the Williams residence were found to match those observed on two of the victims.<ref name=\"nyt-april-2019\"/> Additional fibers from the Williams's home, vehicles, and pet dog were later matched to fibers discovered on other victims.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=px18mE2gR-0C Trace Evidence: Dead People Do Tell Tales] By Stephen Eldridge Enslow Publishers, Inc., 1 July 2011 pg39-49</ref> Furthermore, witness Robert Henry claimed to have seen Williams holding hands and walking with Nathaniel Cater on the night Cater is believed to have died.<ref>[http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1107/04/se.02.html \"CNN Transcripts: Atlanta Child Murders]</ref>\n\nOn June 21, 1981, Williams was arrested. A [[grand jury]] indicted him for first-degree murder in the deaths of Nathaniel Cater and Jimmy Ray Payne, aged 22.<ref name=\"autogenerated1982\"/> The trial date was set for early 1982.\n\nWhen the news of Williams\u2019 arrest was officially released (his status as a suspect had previously been leaked to the media), FBI Agent [[John E. Douglas]] stated that, if it was Williams, then he was \"looking pretty good for a good percentage of the killings.\" Douglas had previously conducted an interview with ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'' magazine about profiling the killer as a young black man. This was widely reported as the FBI effectively declaring Williams guilty, and Douglas was officially censured by the Director of the FBI.<ref>MindHunter Pg 215</ref>\n\n==Trial==\nJury selection began on December 28, 1981, and lasted six days. Nine women and three men comprised the jury, among them eight African Americans and four Caucasians.\n\nThe trial officially began on January 6, 1982, with [[Clarence Cooper (judge)|Judge Clarence Cooper]] presiding. The most important evidence against Williams was the fiber analysis between the victims Williams was indicted for, Jimmy Ray Payne and Nathaniel Cater, and the 12 pattern-murder cases in which circumstantial evidence culminated in numerous links among the crimes. This included witnesses testifying to seeing Williams with the victims, and some witnesses suggesting that he had solicited sexual favors.<ref name=\"autogenerated1982\"/>\n\nThe prosecution's presentation of the case has been criticized, to the extent that in some jurisdictions it might have resulted in a mistrial. In particular, two separate FBI special agents testified that the chances of the victims not having come into contact with Williams was \"virtually impossible,\" based only on the comparative rarity of the fibers found on the victims that seemed to match the suspect's car and home.<ref>[http://scholarworks.gsu.edu/gsulr/vol1/iss1/9/ Johnson, J.

Graham, one of the original investigators in these cases, said he doubted that Wayne Williams, the man convicted of two of the killings and blamed for 22 others, was guilty of all of them.<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ZPsrAAAAIBAJ&sjid=N20FAAAAIBAJ&pg=2866%2C3196741 \"Police chief behind probe in new killings resigns\"], Kentucky New Era, May 4, 2006</ref> On June 21, 2006, the DeKalb County Police dropped its reinvestigation of the Atlanta child murders. After resigning, Graham was replaced by the acting chief, Nick Marinelli, who said, \"We dredged up what we had, and nothing has panned out, so until something does or additional evidence comes our way, or there's [[forensic]] feedback from existing evidence, we will continue to pursue the [other] cold cases that are [with]in our reach.\"<ref name=\"esoteric\">[https://www.amazon.com/The-Esoteric-Codex-Unidentified-Killers/dp/1329021398 \"The Esoteric Codex: Unidentified Serial Killers\"] Royce Leighton, Published by lulu.com, March 27, 2015</ref>{{self-published inline|date=February 2020}}\n\nOn August 6, 2005, journalists reported that Charles T. Sanders of the [[KKK]] once praised the crimes in secretly recorded conversations. Although Sanders did not claim responsibility for any of the deaths, lawyers for Williams believed that the evidence would help their bid for a new trial for Williams. (The police had investigated Sanders in relation to the murders, but dropped the probe into his and the KKK's possible involvement after Sanders was kept under close surveillance for seven weeks, during which four more victims were killed, and after Sanders and two of his brothers volunteered for and passed [[lie detector]] tests.){{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nCriminal [[Criminal profiler|profiler]] [[John E. Douglas]] said that, while he believes that Williams committed many of the murders, he does not think that he committed them all. Douglas added that he believes that law enforcement authorities have some idea of who the other killers are, cryptically adding, \"It isn't a single offender, and the truth isn't pleasant.\"<ref>[https://www.amazon.com/Mindhunter-ebook/dp/B000FC0RRY \"Mind Hunter\"], John Douglas and Mark Olshaker,  Published by Scribner, November 26, 1998</ref>\n\nOn January 29, 2007, attorneys for the State of Georgia agreed to allow [[DNA testing]] of the dog hair that was used to help convict Williams. This decision was a response to a legal filing as a part of Williams' efforts to appeal his conviction and life sentences. Williams' lawyer, Jack Martin, asked a Fulton County Superior Court judge to allow DNA tests on canine and human hair and blood, stating the results might help Williams win a new trial.\n\nOn June 26, 2007, the DNA test results showed that the hairs on the bodies contained the same mitochondrial DNA sequence as Williams' dog\u2014a sequence that occurs in only about 1 out of 100 dogs. Dr. Elizabeth Wictum, director of the [[UC Davis]] laboratory that carried out the testing, told ''The Associated Press'' that while the results were \u201cfairly significant,\u201d they \"don't conclusively point to Williams' dog as the source of the hair\" because the lab was able to test only for [[mitochondrial DNA]], which, unlike [[nuclear DNA]], cannot be shown to be unique to one dog.<ref>[http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/nation/20070626-1055-atlantachildkillings.html \"DA, defense spar over meaning of new DNA test on dog hairs in Atlanta child murder case\"], Sign on San Diego, ''The San Diego Union-Tribune'', 26 Jun 2007</ref>\n\nLater in 2007, the FBI performed DNA tests on two human hairs found on one of the victims. The mitochondrial DNA sequence in the hairs would eliminate 99.5% of persons by not matching their DNA. The mitochondrial DNA sequence in the hairs would eliminate 98% of African American persons by not matching their DNA.

They were assigned to the story after ABC News president Roone Arledge read a tiny story in the newspaper that said police had ruled out any connection between a daycare explosion, which turned out to be a faulty furnace, and the cases of lost and missing children, which had been previously unreported in the national media. In a week, the team reported on the dead and missing children, and they broke the story that the Atlanta Police Task Force was not writing down or following up on every lead they received through the police hotline that had been set up.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nIn 1981 British novelist [[Martin Amis]] published \"The Killings in Atlanta\" for ''[[The Observer]]'', later compiled into ''[[The Moronic Inferno: And Other Visits to America]]'' (1986).\n\nIn 1982, writer [[Martin Pasko]] dedicated an issue of the comic book ''[[Swamp Thing (comic book)|Saga of the Swamp Thing]]'' to \"the good people of Atlanta, that they may put the horror behind them...but not forget.\" The story revolved around a serial killer who targeted minority children in the fictional town of Pineboro, Arkansas who is revealed to be a demon who had possessed TV host \"Uncle Barney\" (a thinly-veiled parody of [[Fred Rogers]]). While the demon is ultimately vanquished, the story ends on an ominous note criticizing the social inequalities that made the non-white children such attractive targets, as well as children's television shows that encourage blind trust of strangers.<ref>''Swamp Thing'' vol. 2, #4 (DC Comics, August 1982).</ref>\n\nIn 1985, the television miniseries ''[[The Atlanta Child Murders (miniseries)|The Atlanta Child Murders]]'' was released.  The film was centered around the murders and the arrest of the suspect.  The film revolved mainly around the aftermath of the killings and the trials. The film starred [[Calvin Levels]], [[Morgan Freeman]], [[James Earl Jones]], [[Rip Torn]], [[Jason Robards]], [[Martin Sheen]], and [[Bill Paxton]].  Atlanta officials criticized the film, claiming that it distorted the facts of the case. After a series of negotiations, [[CBS]] executives agreed to insert a disclaimer alerting viewers that the film is based on fact but contains fictional elements.\n\nAlso in 1985, [[James Baldwin]] published ''[[The Evidence of Things Not Seen]]'', a non-fiction examination not only of the case and Williams' trial, but also of race relations in Atlanta and, by extension, America. The book grew out of an assignment to write about the murders for ''[[Playboy]]'', commissioned by then-editor Walter Lowe.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://movies2.nytimes.com/books/98/03/29/specials/baldwin-evidence.html|title=The Evidence of Things Not Seen|last=Flemming|first=John|date=November 24, 1985|website=movies2.nytimes.com|access-date=2019-07-24}}</ref>\n\nIn 2000, Showtime released a [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] titled ''[[Who Killed Atlanta's Children?]]'' starring [[James Belushi]] and [[Gregory Hines]]. {{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nOn June 10, 2010, CNN broadcast a documentary, ''The Atlanta Child Murders'', with interviews by [[Soledad O'Brien]] with some of the people involved, including [[Wayne Williams]].

The series, which is focused on the history of the FBI's Behavioral Science Unit (BSU) builds that dramatic arc of the series over the FBI's two BSU agents who join the Atlanta investigation. In the series fictional treatment, Agent Ford has the role of insisting that the 13 murders (at the time of the series arc) they are investigating are the work of one single serial killer, and that to gain the victims' trust, he may be African-American himself. This line of deduction clashes with that of his colleague Agent Tench, the Atlanta Police Department, and the African-American community of Atlanta\u2013many of whom believe, in light of Georgia's history of hate crimes and racial violence, that the killings are the work of the Ku Klux Klan.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vulture.com/2019/09/mindhunter-john-douglas-atlanta-child-murders.html|title=The Real FBI Agent Behind Mindhunter on What Actually Happened in Atlanta|last=Sherer|first=Devon|date=September 6, 2019|website=Vulture|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-09-10}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vulture.com/2019/08/mindhunter-atlanta-child-murders-true-story.html|title=The True Story Behind Mindhunter\u2019s Atlanta Child Murders|last=Tallerico|first=Brian|date=August 30, 2019|website=Vulture|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=September 10, 2019}}</ref>\n\n''The Atlanta Child Murders'', a three-part documentary series produced by [[Will Packer Productions]], aired on [[Investigation Discovery]] in March 2019.<ref>{{cite web|last=White |first=Peter |url=https://deadline.com/2019/02/atlanta-child-murders-will-packer-id-1202555528/ |title=Will Packer To Produce \u2018The Atlanta Child Murders\u2019 For ID |publisher=Deadline |date=2019-02-12 |accessdate=2019-03-02}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Post\u2013civil rights era in African-American history|Post-civil rights era African-American history]]\n* ''[[Leaving Atlanta]]'', a 2002 novel based on the murders\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* [[Robert D.

The band had only achieved moderate commercial success up to that point, and the band split shortly after their second album due to internal conflicts. Vocalist [[Richard Ashcroft]] quickly reformed the group, with [[Simon Tong]], an old friend of the band on guitar, however Ashcroft realised [[Nick McCabe]]'s unique guitar style was required to complete the true Verve unit and later asked him to return. Tong also remained adding more guitar and keyboard/organ textures, making them a five-piece band and expanding their sound.<ref name=\"YELLOW\">[http://www.musicsaves.org/verve/interviews/36.shtml Follow the Yellow Brick Road]</ref>\n\nThe four-piece had already recorded several tracks for the album with [[Martin Glover|Youth]] as producer, but once McCabe returned they re-recorded several tracks and changed producers to [[Chris Potter (producer)|Chris Potter]]. McCabe said that in the next seven months of work, \"...&nbsp;the key tracks were recorded from scratch, but some of them were already there.\"<ref name=\"interview\">{{cite web|url=http://www.excellentonline.com/story/nick-mccabe-interview-733|title=Nick McCabe Interview|website=Excellent Online|access-date=30 April 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710211338/http://www.excellentonline.com/story/nick-mccabe-interview-733|archive-date=10 July 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe cover photo was taken in [[Richmond Park]], London by photographer Brian Cannon, who was also responsible for the artwork of the band's previous two albums. Cannon said that the simplicity of the image was because Ashcroft simply wanted fans to \"listen to the fucking record\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.radiox.co.uk/artists/the-verve/urban-hymns-album-facts-things-may-not-know/|title=Things You May Not Know About The Verve\u2019s Urban Hymns...|date=17 December 2018|website=Radio X|accessdate=24 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Music==\nThe Verve were known for their music's complex, immersive sonic textures. \"Bitter Sweet Symphony\" was a hit on both sides of the Atlantic, and remains the band's most well-known song. \"The Drugs Don't Work\", the band's only number one single in the [[UK]], became a concert staple for [[jam band]]s and other groups.{{Citation needed|reason=Which bands, specifically?|date=August 2017}}\n\nThe rest of the album alternated between wistful ballads like \"Sonnet\" and \"Space and Time\" (written by Richard Ashcroft), spacey grooves like \"Catching the Butterfly\" and \"The Rolling People\", all-out rockers like the pounding \"Come On\" (which existed in demo from the \"Northern Soul\" era) and psychedelic driven songs like \"Neon Wilderness\". The hidden track \"Deep Freeze\" features distorted guitars and a baby's cry sound.

It earned nearly unanimous critical praise upon its release, and went on to become the band's best-selling release and one of the biggest selling albums of the year. {{As of|2019}}, ''Urban Hymns'' is  ranked the 18th [[List of best-selling albums in the United Kingdom|best-selling album]] in UK chart history<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/the-best-selling-albums-of-all-time-on-the-official-uk-chart__15551/|title=The best-selling albums of all time on the Official UK Chart |publisher=[[Official Charts Company]] |accessdate=26 March 2020}}</ref> and has sold over ten million copies worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bpi.co.uk/assets/files/top%2040%20albums.pdf|title=Top 40 Best Selling Albums: 28 July 1956&nbsp;\u2013 14 June 2009|publisher=[[Official Charts Company]]|accessdate=2011-07-26}}</ref>\n\nThe album features the hit singles \"[[Bitter Sweet Symphony]]\", \"[[Lucky Man (The Verve song)|Lucky Man]]\" and UK number one \"[[The Drugs Don't Work]]\".

The band had only achieved moderate commercial success up to that point, and the band split shortly after their second album due to internal conflicts. Vocalist [[Richard Ashcroft]] quickly reformed the group, with [[Simon Tong]], an old friend of the band on guitar, however Ashcroft realised [[Nick McCabe]]'s unique guitar style was required to complete the true Verve unit and later asked him to return. Tong also remained adding more guitar and keyboard/organ textures, making them a five-piece band and expanding their sound.<ref name=\"YELLOW\">[http://www.musicsaves.org/verve/interviews/36.shtml Follow the Yellow Brick Road]</ref>\n\nThe four-piece had already recorded several tracks for the album with [[Martin Glover|Youth]] as producer, but once McCabe returned they re-recorded several tracks and changed producers to [[Chris Potter (producer)|Chris Potter]]. McCabe said that in the next seven months of work, \"...&nbsp;the key tracks were recorded from scratch, but some of them were already there.\"<ref name=\"interview\">{{cite web|url=http://www.excellentonline.com/story/nick-mccabe-interview-733|title=Nick McCabe Interview|website=Excellent Online|access-date=30 April 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710211338/http://www.excellentonline.com/story/nick-mccabe-interview-733|archive-date=10 July 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe cover photo was taken in [[Richmond Park]], London by photographer Brian Cannon, who was also responsible for the artwork of the band's previous two albums. Cannon said that the simplicity of the image was because Ashcroft simply wanted fans to \"listen to the fucking record\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.radiox.co.uk/artists/the-verve/urban-hymns-album-facts-things-may-not-know/|title=Things You May Not Know About The Verve\u2019s Urban Hymns...|date=17 December 2018|website=Radio X|accessdate=24 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Music==\nThe Verve were known for their music's complex, immersive sonic textures. \"Bitter Sweet Symphony\" was a hit on both sides of the Atlantic, and remains the band's most well-known song. \"The Drugs Don't Work\", the band's only number one single in the [[UK]], became a concert staple for [[jam band]]s and other groups.{{Citation needed|reason=Which bands, specifically?|date=August 2017}}\n\nThe rest of the album alternated between wistful ballads like \"Sonnet\" and \"Space and Time\" (written by Richard Ashcroft), spacey grooves like \"Catching the Butterfly\" and \"The Rolling People\", all-out rockers like the pounding \"Come On\" (which existed in demo from the \"Northern Soul\" era) and psychedelic driven songs like \"Neon Wilderness\". The hidden track \"Deep Freeze\" features distorted guitars and a baby's cry sound. It has strong ambient influences that set it apart from the rest of the tracks in terms of composition and overall mood.\n\n==Release and reception==\n{{Album reviews\n| rev1 = [[AllMusic]]\n|
