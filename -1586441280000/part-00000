It consisted of [[#Auschwitz I|Auschwitz I]], the main camp (''Stammlager'') in [[O\u015bwi\u0119cim]]; [[#Auschwitz II-Birkenau|Auschwitz II-Birkenau]], a concentration and extermination camp built with several [[gas chamber]]s; [[#Auschwitz III|Auschwitz III-Monowitz]], a labor camp created to staff a factory for the chemical conglomerate [[IG Farben]]; and [[List of subcamps of Auschwitz|dozens of subcamps]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Auschwitz I, Auschwitz II-Birkenau, Auschwitz III-Monowitz |url=http://70.auschwitz.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=87&Itemid=173&lang=en |publisher=Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20190122190412/http://70.auschwitz.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=87&Itemid=173&lang=en |archivedate=22 January 2019 |url-status = live}}</ref> The camps became a major site of the Nazis' [[Final Solution to the Jewish Question]].\n\nAfter Germany [[Causes of World War II#Invasion of Poland|sparked World War II]] by [[Invasion of Poland|invading Poland]] in September 1939, the ''[[Schutzstaffel]]'' (SS) converted Auschwitz I, an army barracks, into a prisoner-of-war camp for Polish political prisoners.{{sfn|Dwork|van Pelt|2002|p=166}} The first inmates, German criminals brought to the camp in May 1940 as [[#functionaries|functionaries]], established the camp's reputation for sadism, beating, torturing, and executing prisoners for the most trivial reasons. The first gassings\u2014of Soviet and Polish prisoners\u2014took place in [[#block 11|block 11]] of Auschwitz I around August 1941. Construction of Auschwitz II began the following month, and from 1942 until late 1944 freight trains delivered Jews from all over [[German-occupied Europe]] to its gas chambers. Of the [[#numbers|1.3 million people]] sent to Auschwitz, 1.1&nbsp;million died. The death toll includes 960,000 Jews (865,000 of whom were gassed on arrival), 74,000 non-Jewish Poles, 21,000 Roma, 15,000 Soviet prisoners of war, and up to 15,000 other Europeans.<ref name=Piperfigures/> Those not gassed died of starvation, exhaustion, disease, individual executions, or beatings. Others were killed during [[Nazi human experimentation|medical experiments]].\n\nAt least 802 prisoners tried to escape, 144 successfully, and on 7 October 1944 two ''[[Sonderkommando]]'' units, consisting of prisoners who staffed the gas chambers, launched an unsuccessful uprising. Only 789 staff (no more than 15 percent) ever stood trial;{{sfn|Lasik|2000b|p=116, n.&nbsp;19}} several, including camp commandant [[Rudolf H\u00f6ss]], were executed. The [[Allies of World War II|Allies]]' failure to act on early reports of atrocities in the camp by bombing it or its railways remains controversial.\n\nAs the Soviet [[Red Army]] approached Auschwitz in January 1945, toward the end of the war, the SS sent most of the camp's population west on a [[Death marches (Holocaust)|death march]] to camps inside Germany and Austria. Soviet troops [[#Liberation|entered the camp]] on 27 January 1945, a day commemorated since 2005 as [[International Holocaust Remembrance Day]]. In the decades after the war, survivors such as [[Primo Levi]], [[Viktor Frankl]], and [[Elie Wiesel]] wrote memoirs of their experiences, and the camp became a dominant symbol of the Holocaust. In 1947 Poland founded the [[Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum]] on the site of Auschwitz I and II, and in 1979 it was named a [[World Heritage Site]] by [[UNESCO]].\n\n==Background==\n{{Further|Adolf Hitler's rise to power|Jews escaping from German-occupied Europe|Invasion of Poland|Declarations of war during World War II|Invasion of the Soviet Union}}\n{{multiple image | direction = vertical |align = left | width = 220\n| image1 = Concentration camps in occupied Europe (2007 borders).png\n| caption1 = Camps and ghettos in [[occupied Europe]] (2007 borders); [[:File:WW2-Holocaust-Europe.png|same map showing WWII borders]]\n| image2 = Map of Auschwitz and environs, 1944.jpg\n| caption2 = Auschwitz I, II, and III\n}}\nThe ideology of [[National Socialism]] (Nazism) brought together elements of \"[[racial hygiene]]\", [[eugenics]], and [[antisemitism]], [[Richard J.

The report said of the Jews in the camp that \"scarcely any of them came out alive\". According to Fleming, the booklet was \"widely circulated amongst British officials\". The ''Polish Fortnightly Review'' based a story on it, writing that \"three crematorium furnaces were insufficient to cope with the bodies being cremated\", as did ''[[The Scotsman]]'' on 8 January 1942, the only British news organization to do so.{{sfn|Fleming|2014|pp=131\u2013132}}\n\nOn 24 December 1941, the resistance groups representing the various prisoner factions met in block 45 and agreed to cooperate. Fleming writes that it has not been possible to track Pilecki's early intelligence from the camp. Pilecki compiled two reports after he escaped in April 1943; the second, [[Raport W]], detailed his life in Auschwitz I and estimated that 1.5&nbsp;million people, mostly Jews, had been killed.{{sfn|Fleming|2014|p=132}} On 1 July 1942, the ''Polish Fortnightly Review'' published a report describing Birkenau, writing that \"prisoners call this supplementary camp 'Paradisal', presumably because there is only one road, leading to Paradise\". Reporting that inmates were being killed \"through excessive work, torture and medical means\", it noted the gassing of the Soviet prisoners of war and Polish inmates in Auschwitz I in September 1941, the first gassing in the camp. It said: \"It is estimated that the Oswiecim camp can accommodate fifteen thousand prisoners, but as they die on a mass scale there is always room for new arrivals.\"{{sfn|Fleming|2014|p=133}}<!--Needs secondary sources: From 1942, members of the [[Bureau of Information and Propaganda]] of the Warsaw-area Home Army published reports based on the accounts of escapees.

The exception was the ''Polish Jewish Observer'', a ''[[City and East London Observer]]'' supplement edited by Joel Cang, a former Warsaw correspondent for the ''[[Manchester Guardian]]''. The British reticence stemmed from a Foreign Office concern that the public might pressure the government to respond or provide refuge for the Jews, and that British actions on behalf of the Jews might affect its relationships in the Middle East. There was similar reticence in the United States, and indeed within the Polish government-in-exile and the Polish resistance. According to Fleming, the scholarship suggests that the Polish resistance distributed information about the Holocaust in Auschwitz without challenging the Allies' reluctance to highlight it.{{sfn|Fleming|2016|pp=63\u201365}}\n\n===Escapes, ''Auschwitz Protocols''{{anchor|escapes}}===\n{{Further|Vrba-Wetzler report|Auschwitz Protocols}}\n[[File:Telegram, Vrba and Wetzler escape, Auschwitz, 8 April 1944.jpg|thumb|upright|Telegram dated 8 April 1944 from ''KL Auschwitz'' reporting the escape of [[Rudolf Vrba]] and [[Alfr\u00e9d Wetzler]]]]\nFrom the first escape on 6 July 1940 of [[Tadeusz Wiejowski]], at least 802 prisoners (757 men and 45 women) tried to escape from the camp, according to Polish historian [[Henryk \u015awiebocki]].<ref>For Wiejowski, {{harvnb|\u015awiebocki|2000|p=194}}; for the rest, pp.&nbsp;232\u2013233.</ref>{{efn|The escapees included 396 Polish men and 10 Polish women; 164 men from the Soviet Union (including 50 prisoners of war), and 15 women; 112 Jewish men and three Jewish women; 36 Romani/Sinti men and two women; 22 German men and nine women; 19 Czech men and four women; two Austrian men; one Yugoslav woman and one man; and 15 other men and one woman.{{sfn|\u015awiebocki|2000|p=233}}}} He writes that most escapes were attempted from work sites outside the camp's perimeter fence.{{sfn|\u015awiebocki|2000|p=192}} Of the 802 escapes, 144 were successful, 327 were caught, and the fate of 331 is unknown.{{sfn|\u015awiebocki|2000|p=233}}\n\nFour Polish prisoners\u2014Eugeniusz Bendera (serial number 8502), [[Kazimierz Piechowski]] (no.&nbsp;918), Stanis\u0142aw Gustaw Jaster (no.&nbsp;6438), and J\u00f3zef Lempart (no.&nbsp;3419)\u2014escaped successfully on 20 June 1942.

It consisted of [[#Auschwitz I|Auschwitz I]], the main camp (''Stammlager'') in [[O\u015bwi\u0119cim]]; [[#Auschwitz II-Birkenau|Auschwitz II-Birkenau]], a concentration and extermination camp built with several [[gas chamber]]s; [[#Auschwitz III|Auschwitz III-Monowitz]], a labor camp created to staff a factory for the chemical conglomerate [[IG Farben]]; and [[List of subcamps of Auschwitz|dozens of subcamps]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Auschwitz I, Auschwitz II-Birkenau, Auschwitz III-Monowitz |url=http://70.auschwitz.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=87&Itemid=173&lang=en |publisher=Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20190122190412/http://70.auschwitz.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=87&Itemid=173&lang=en |archivedate=22 January 2019 |url-status = live}}</ref> The camps became a major site of the Nazis' [[Final Solution to the Jewish Question]].\n\nAfter Germany [[Causes of World War II#Invasion of Poland|sparked World War II]] by [[Invasion of Poland|invading Poland]] in September 1939, the ''[[Schutzstaffel]]'' (SS) converted Auschwitz I, an army barracks, into a prisoner-of-war camp for Polish political prisoners.{{sfn|Dwork|van Pelt|2002|p=166}} The first inmates, German criminals brought to the camp in May 1940 as [[#functionaries|functionaries]], established the camp's reputation for sadism, beating, torturing, and executing prisoners for the most trivial reasons. The first gassings\u2014of Soviet and Polish prisoners\u2014took place in [[#block 11|block 11]] of Auschwitz I around August 1941. Construction of Auschwitz II began the following month, and from 1942 until late 1944 freight trains delivered Jews from all over [[German-occupied Europe]] to its gas chambers. Of the [[#numbers|1.3 million people]] sent to Auschwitz, 1.1 million died. The death toll includes 960,000 Jews (865,000 of whom were gassed on arrival), 74,000 non-Jewish Poles, 21,000 Roma, 15,000 Soviet prisoners of war, and up to 15,000 other Europeans.<ref name=Piperfigures/> Those not gassed died of starvation, exhaustion, disease, individual executions, or beatings. Others were killed during [[Nazi human experimentation|medical experiments]].\n\nAt least 802 prisoners tried to escape, 144 successfully, and on 7 October 1944 two ''[[Sonderkommando]]'' units, consisting of prisoners who staffed the gas chambers, launched an unsuccessful uprising. Only 789 staff (no more than 15 percent) ever stood trial;{{sfn|Lasik|2000b|p=116, n.&nbsp;19}} several, including camp commandant [[Rudolf H\u00f6ss]], were executed. The [[Allies of World War II|Allies]]' failure to act on early reports of atrocities in the camp by bombing it or its railways remains controversial.\n\nAs the Soviet [[Red Army]] approached Auschwitz in January 1945, toward the end of the war, the SS sent most of the camp's population west on a [[Death marches (Holocaust)|death march]] to camps inside Germany and Austria. Soviet troops [[#Liberation|entered the camp]] on 27 January 1945, a day commemorated since 2005 as [[International Holocaust Remembrance Day]]. In the decades after the war, survivors such as [[Primo Levi]], [[Viktor Frankl]], and [[Elie Wiesel]] wrote memoirs of their experiences, and the camp became a dominant symbol of the Holocaust. In 1947 Poland founded the [[Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum]] on the site of Auschwitz I and II, and in 1979 it was named a [[World Heritage Site]] by [[UNESCO]].\n\n==Background==\n{{Further|Adolf Hitler's rise to power|Jews escaping from German-occupied Europe|Invasion of Poland|Declarations of war during World War II|Invasion of the Soviet Union}}\n{{multiple image | direction = vertical |align = left | width = 220\n| image1 = Concentration camps in occupied Europe (2007 borders).png\n| caption1 = Camps and ghettos in [[occupied Europe]] (2007 borders); [[:File:WW2-Holocaust-Europe.png|same map showing WWII borders]]\n| image2 = Map of Auschwitz and environs, 1944.jpg\n| caption2 = Auschwitz I, II, and III\n}}\nThe ideology of [[National Socialism]] (Nazism) brought together elements of \"[[racial hygiene]]\", [[eugenics]], and [[antisemitism]], [[Richard J.

The report said of the Jews in the camp that \"scarcely any of them came out alive\". According to Fleming, the booklet was \"widely circulated amongst British officials\". The ''Polish Fortnightly Review'' based a story on it, writing that \"three crematorium furnaces were insufficient to cope with the bodies being cremated\", as did ''[[The Scotsman]]'' on 8 January 1942, the only British news organization to do so.{{sfn|Fleming|2014|pp=131\u2013132}}\n\nOn 24 December 1941, the resistance groups representing the various prisoner factions met in block 45 and agreed to cooperate. Fleming writes that it has not been possible to track Pilecki's early intelligence from the camp. Pilecki compiled two reports after he escaped in April 1943; the second, [[Raport W]], detailed his life in Auschwitz I and estimated that 1.5 million people, mostly Jews, had been killed.{{sfn|Fleming|2014|p=132}} On 1 July 1942, the ''Polish Fortnightly Review'' published a report describing Birkenau, writing that \"prisoners call this supplementary camp 'Paradisal', presumably because there is only one road, leading to Paradise\". Reporting that inmates were being killed \"through excessive work, torture and medical means\", it noted the gassing of the Soviet prisoners of war and Polish inmates in Auschwitz I in September 1941, the first gassing in the camp. It said: \"It is estimated that the Oswiecim camp can accommodate fifteen thousand prisoners, but as they die on a mass scale there is always room for new arrivals.\"{{sfn|Fleming|2014|p=133}}<!--Needs secondary sources: From 1942, members of the [[Bureau of Information and Propaganda]] of the Warsaw-area Home Army published reports based on the accounts of escapees.

The exception was the ''Polish Jewish Observer'', a ''[[City and East London Observer]]'' supplement edited by Joel Cang, a former Warsaw correspondent for the ''[[Manchester Guardian]]''. The British reticence stemmed from a Foreign Office concern that the public might pressure the government to respond or provide refuge for the Jews, and that British actions on behalf of the Jews might affect its relationships in the Middle East. There was similar reticence in the United States, and indeed within the Polish government-in-exile and the Polish resistance. According to Fleming, the scholarship suggests that the Polish resistance distributed information about the Holocaust in Auschwitz without challenging the Allies' reluctance to highlight it.{{sfn|Fleming|2016|pp=63\u201365}}\n\n===Escapes, ''Auschwitz Protocols''{{anchor|escapes}}===\n{{Further|Vrba-Wetzler report|Auschwitz Protocols}}\n[[File:Telegram, Vrba and Wetzler escape, Auschwitz, 8 April 1944.jpg|thumb|upright|Telegram dated 8 April 1944 from ''KL Auschwitz'' reporting the escape of [[Rudolf Vrba]] and [[Alfr\u00e9d Wetzler]]]]\nFrom the first escape on 6 July 1940 of [[Tadeusz Wiejowski]], at least 802 prisoners (757 men and 45 women) tried to escape from the camp, according to Polish historian [[Henryk \u015awiebocki]].<ref>For Wiejowski, {{harvnb|\u015awiebocki|2000|p=194}}; for the rest, pp.&nbsp;232\u2013233.</ref>{{efn|The escapees included 396 Polish men and 10 Polish women; 164 men from the Soviet Union (including 50 prisoners of war), and 15 women; 112 Jewish men and three Jewish women; 36 Romani/Sinti men and two women; 22 German men and nine women; 19 Czech men and four women; two Austrian men; one Yugoslav woman and one man; and 15 other men and one woman.{{sfn|\u015awiebocki|2000|p=233}}}} He writes that most escapes were attempted from work sites outside the camp's perimeter fence.{{sfn|\u015awiebocki|2000|p=192}} Of the 802 escapes, 144 were successful, 327 were caught, and the fate of 331 is unknown.{{sfn|\u015awiebocki|2000|p=233}}\n\nFour Polish prisoners\u2014Eugeniusz Bendera (serial number 8502), [[Kazimierz Piechowski]] (no.&nbsp;918), Stanis\u0142aw Gustaw Jaster (no.&nbsp;6438), and J\u00f3zef Lempart (no.&nbsp;3419)\u2014escaped successfully on 20 June 1942.

He is the lead guitarist of the rock band [[Queen (band)|Queen]]. His songs include \"[[We Will Rock You]]\", \"[[Tie Your Mother Down]]\", \"[[I Want It All (Queen song)|I Want It All]]\", \"[[Fat Bottomed Girls]]\", \"[[Flash (Queen song)|Flash]]\", \"[[Hammer to Fall]]\", \"[[Save Me (Queen song)|Save Me]]\", \"[[Who Wants to Live Forever]]\" and \"[[The Show Must Go On (Queen song)|The Show Must Go On]]\".\n\nMay was a co-founder of Queen with lead singer [[Freddie Mercury]] and drummer [[Roger Taylor (Queen drummer)|Roger Taylor]], having previously performed with Taylor in the band [[Smile (band)|Smile]], which he had joined while he was at university. Within five years of their formation in 1970 and the recruitment of bass player [[John Deacon]] completing the lineup, Queen had become one of the biggest rock bands in the world with the success of the album ''[[A Night at the Opera (Queen album)|A Night at the Opera]]'' and its single \"[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]\". From the mid-1970s until the early 1990s, Queen were an almost constant presence in the UK charts and played some of the biggest venues in the world, most notably giving an acclaimed performance at [[Live Aid]] in 1985. As a member of Queen, May became regarded as a virtuoso musician and he was identified with a distinctive sound created through his layered guitar work, often using a home-built electric guitar called the [[Red Special]].<ref name=redspecial>{{cite book |last1=May|first1=Brian |authorlink1= Brian May|last2=Bradley |first2=Simon |title=Brian May's Red Special  |date=2014 |publisher=Prion Books |isbn=978-1-78097-276-3 }}</ref>\n\nFollowing the death of Mercury in 1991, aside from the [[The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert|1992 tribute concert]], the release of ''[[Made in Heaven]]'' (1995) and the 1997 tribute single to Mercury, \"[[No-One but You (Only the Good Die Young)]]\" (written by May), Queen were put on hiatus for several years but were eventually reconvened by May and Taylor for further performances featuring other vocalists.

In 1986, May contributed to former [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]] guitarist [[Steve Hackett]]'s album ''[[Feedback 86]]'', playing guitar on the track \"Cassandra\" and providing guitar and vocals for \"Slot Machine,\" the latter co-written by May. Although produced in 1986, the album was not issued as a commercial release until 2000. In the same year, May worked with actress [[Anita Dobson]] on her first album, most noted for the song \"Anyone Can Fall in Love\", which added lyrics to the ''[[EastEnders]]'' theme tune and reached no. 4 in the [[UK Singles Chart]] in August 1986.

An earlier version of the band was loosely formed for 19 October 1991, the date of the band's last concert of reunion, when May took part in the ''Guitar Legends'' guitar festival in [[Seville]], Spain. The line-up for his performance was May on vocals and lead guitar, [[Cozy Powell]] on drums and percussion, [[Mike Moran (music producer)|Mike Moran]] and [[Rick Wakeman]] on keyboards, and [[Maggie Ryder]], [[Miriam Stockley]] and [[Chris Thompson (English musician)|Chris Thompson]] on backing vocals. The original line-up was May on vocals and lead guitar, Powell on drums and percussion, [[Michael Casswell]] on guitar, [[Neil Murray (British musician)|Neil Murray]] on bass, and Ryder, Stockley and Thompson on backing vocals. This version of the band lasted only during the South American support tour (supporting [[The B-52's]] and [[Joe Cocker]]) on only five dates.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Lemieux|first1=Patrick|title=The Queen Chronology|date=2018|publisher=Lulu|page=137|edition=2nd}}</ref>\n\nAfterwards, May made significant changes, feeling the group never quite gelled. May brought guitarist [[Jamie Moses]] on board to replace Mike Caswell. The other change made was in the backing vocals department, when Ryder, Stockley and Thompson were replaced with [[Catherine Porter]] and [[Shelley Preston]]. On 23 February 1993, this new line-up of The Brian May Band began its world tour in the US, both supporting [[Guns N' Roses]] and headlining a few dates.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ultimatequeen.co.uk/live/brian.htm#1993bttlnorthamerica1|title=1993 Back To The Light North American Tour (1st leg)|publisher=Ultimatequeen.co.uk|accessdate=27 September 2014}}</ref> The tour would take them through North America, Europe (support act: Valentine) and Japan.

May subsequently changed the approach from covers to focus on those collaborations and on new material. The songs included ''[[Another World (Brian May album)|Another World]]'', and featured mainly [[Spike Edney]], Cozy Powell, Neil Murray and Jamie Moses. On 5 April 1998, Cozy Powell was killed in a car accident on the [[M4 motorway]] near [[Bristol]], England. This caused huge unexpected disruption to the upcoming tour for The Brian May Band, with a new drummer being needed at short notice. [[Steve Ferrone]] was brought on to help May finish recording drums and to join the band for the early stage promotional tour of five dates in Europe before the world tour. Following the early promotional tour, [[Eric Singer]] replaced Steve Ferrone for the full 1998 world tour.\n\nThe 1998 tour saw the brief introduction of a 'support act' known as T. E. Conway.  Conway (Brian May in a wig and colourful suit playing the part of a [[teddy boy]] crooner) would play a number of 1950s [[rock and roll]] standards prior to May's 'arrival'.  A bonus T. E. Conway EP entitled ''Retro Rock Special'' was attached to some pressings of the ''Another World'' album.

Examples are found in Queen's albums ''A Night at the Opera'' and ''A Day at the Races'', where he arranged a jazz band for guitar mini-orchestra (\"Good Company\"), a vocal canon (\"The Prophet's Song\") and guitar and vocal counterpoints (\"[[Teo Torriatte]]\").\n\nMay explored a wide variety of styles in guitar, including [[sweep picking]] (\"[[Was It All Worth It]]\", \"Chinese Torture\"), [[tremolo]] (\"Brighton Rock\", \"[[Stone Cold Crazy]]\", \"[[Death on Two Legs (Dedicated to...)|Death on Two Legs]]\", \"[[Sweet Lady (Queen song)|Sweet Lady]]\", \"Bohemian Rhapsody\", \"[[Get Down Make Love]]\", \"[[Dragon Attack]]\"), [[tapping]] (\"[[Bijou (Queen song)|Bijou]]\", \"[[It's Late]]\", \"[[Resurrection]]\", \"Cyborg\", \"Rain Must Fall\", \"Business\", \"China Belle\", \"I Was Born To Love You\"), slide guitar (\"Drowse\", \"Tie Your Mother Down\"), [[Jimi Hendrix|Hendrix]] sounding licks (\"[[Liar (Queen song)|Liar]]\", \"Brighton Rock\"), tape-delay (\"Brighton Rock\", \"White Man\") and melodic sequences (\"Bohemian Rhapsody\", \"[[Killer Queen]]\", \"[[These Are the Days of Our Lives]]\"). Some of his solos and orchestral parts were composed by [[Freddie Mercury]], who then asked May to bring them to life (\"Bicycle Race\", \"Lazing on a Sunday Afternoon\", \"Killer Queen\", \"[[Good Old Fashioned Lover Boy]]\"). May also performed notable acoustic works, including the finger-picked solo of \"White Queen\" (from ''[[Queen II]]''),  \"[[Love of My Life (Queen song)|Love of My Life]]\" and the [[skiffle]]-influenced \"'39\" (both from ''A Night at the Opera'').\n\nAided by the uniqueness of the Red Special, May was often able to create strange and unusual sound effects. For example, he was able to imitate an orchestra in the song \"[[Queen II#Procession|Procession]]\"; in \"[[Get Down, Make Love]]\" he was able to create various sound effects with his guitar; in \"[[Good Company (Queen song)|Good Company]]\" he used his guitar to mimic a trombone, a piccolo and several other instruments for the song's Dixieland jazz band feel. Queen used a \"No synthesizers were used on this album\" sleeve note on their early albums to make this clear to the listeners.<ref>Cunningham, Mark (October 1995).

The most famous replicas were made by John Birch in 1975 (May actually smashed it during a concert in the States in 1982), [[Greco guitars|Greco]] BM90 (featured in the promo video of \"Good Old-Fashioned Lover Boy\" in 1977), Guild (back-up from 1984 to 1993), Fryers (1997\u20131998, used both live and in the studio) and Guyton<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guytonguitars.com/rsintro.php |title=Guitar Builder (Luthier) in East Anglia, UK \u2013 High Quality Hand Made Custom Electric Guitars by Andrew Guyton |publisher=Guytonguitars.com |accessdate=15 July 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203025707/http://www.guytonguitars.com/rsintro.php |archivedate=3 February 2014 }}</ref> (back-up from 2003 to present). On stage, May used to carry at least one back-up guitar (in case he broke a string) and occasionally would use others for certain songs or parts, such as alternate tunings. Currently, May owns a company which makes guitars whose design is modelled after the original Red Special guitar.\n\n*July 1973&nbsp;\u2013 May 1974: [[Fender Stratocaster]] CBS era (thought to be a 1972)\n*October 1974&nbsp;\u2013 May 1975: [[Gibson Les Paul]] Deluxe, and the Stratocaster from the previous tour.\n*November 1975&nbsp;\u2013 May 1976: Same two guitars as before, plus a natural finish John Birch replica of the Red Special.\n*September 1976: Same three as before, plus a Martin D-18 acoustic for \"'39\".\n*January 1977&nbsp;\u2013 August 1979: Just the Birch replica plus an Ovation Pacemaker 12-string acoustic on some numbers (\"'39\", \"Love of My Life\", \"Dreamer's Ball\").\n*November 1979&nbsp;\u2013 June 1982: Birch replica (back-up), [[Fender Telecaster]] (\"Crazy Little Thing Called Love\" 2nd verse, middle-eight and solo), Ovation (acoustic numbers).\n*July&nbsp;\u2013 November 1982: Added a [[Gibson Flying V]] as second back-up. On 9 August 1982 May smashed the Birch guitar, so the Flying&nbsp;V became the only spare.\n*August&nbsp;\u2013 October 1984: The Flying V became a second back-up again as his main spare was the Guild replica. He also used Roger Taylor's Gibson Chet-Atkins Classical Electric.\n*July 1985&nbsp;\u2013 August 1986: Gibson Flying V no longer used. The rest remained the same.\n*In 2012 he received a double-neck replica of the Red Special with the second neck having 12-strings. He used this guitar at a few gigs with [[Adam Lambert]] now being able to play the 12-string part from the studio version of \"Under Pressure\" live.<ref name=\"Double-neck Red Special\">{{cite web|url=http://www.musicradar.com/guitarist/brian-mays-guyton-double-neck-549856|title=Brian May's Guyton Double Neck|author=Simon Bradley|publisher=Musicradar.com|accessdate=27 September 2014}}</ref>\n\nHe currently has a Guild 12-string to replace his Ovation Pacemaker. Some of the non-RS electric guitars he used in the studio included:\n*[[Burns London|Burns]] Double Six on \"Long Away\" (1976) and \"Under Pressure\" (1981).\n*Fender Telecaster on \"Crazy Little Thing Called Love\" (1979). It was used for the video (but not the recordings) of \"Back Chat\" (1982).\n*Gibson Firebird on \"Hammer to Fall\" and \"Tear It Up\" (album versions only, not on stage).\n*[[Ibanez JS Series|Ibanez JS]] on \"Nothing But Blue\" (1991).\n*[[Parker Fly]] on \"Mother Love\" (1993\u20131995).\n\nFor acoustic, he favoured Ovation, Martin, [[T\u014dkai Guitars|T\u014dkai]] Hummingbird, Godin and Guild. On a couple of videos, he also used some different electric guitars: a Stratocaster copy on \"Play the Game\" (1980) and a [[Washburn RR-V Tour Series|Washburn RR2V]] on \"Princes of the Universe\" (1986).\n\nIn 1984, [[Guild Guitar Company|Guild]] released the first official Red Special replica for mass production, and made some prototypes specifically for May. However, the solid body construction (the original RS has hollow cavities in the body) and the pick-ups (DiMarzio) that were not an exact replica of the Burns TriSonic did not make May happy, so the production stopped after just 300&nbsp;guitars. In 1993, Guild made a second replica of the RS, made in just 1000&nbsp;copies, of which May has some and used as a back-up. At the moment, he uses the two guitars made by Greg Fryer\u2014the luthier who restored the Old Lady in 1998\u2014as back-up. They are almost identical to the original, except for the Fryer logo on the headstock (May's original one has a sixpence).\n\n====Amplifiers and effects====\n[[File:VOX AC30 Twin.jpg|thumb|The [[Vox AC30]] amplifier]]\n{{Quote box\n | quote  = I've never heard a guitar sound so loud!

January 2014)</ref> His choice is the model AC30TBX, the top-boost version with Blue Alnico speakers, and he runs the amp at full volume on the Normal channel.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brianmaycentral.net/bms.html |title=Vox AC30 Brian May |publisher=Brianmaycentral.net |accessdate=27 September 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141029011512/http://www.brianmaycentral.net/bms.html |archivedate=29 October 2014  }}</ref>\n\nMay also customises his amps by removing the circuitry for the Brilliant and Vib-trem channels (leaving only the circuitry for the Normal), and this alters the tone slightly, with a gain addition of 6\u20137&nbsp;dB. He always used a [[treble booster]] which, along with the AC30 and his custom '[[Deacy Amp]]' transistor amp, built by Queen bass player John Deacon, went a long way in helping to create many of his signature guitar tones.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://queenwillrockyou.weebly.com/deacy-amp.html|title=The Legendary Deacy Amp|publisher=queenwillrockyou.weebly.com}}</ref> He used the Dallas Rangemaster for the first Queen albums, up to ''[[A Day at the Races (album)|A Day at the Races]]''. Effects designer [[Pete Cornish]] built for him the TB-83 (32&nbsp;dB of gain) that was used for all the remaining Queen albums. He switched in 2000 to the Fryer's booster, which actually gives less boost than the TB-83.\n\nWhen performing live, May uses banks of Vox AC30 amplifiers, keeping some amps with only guitar and others with all effects such as delay, flanger and chorus. He has a rack of 14&nbsp;AC30s, which are grouped as Normal, Chorus, Delay&nbsp;1, Delay&nbsp;2. On his pedal board, May has a custom switch unit made by Cornish and subsequently modified by Fryer that allows him to choose which amps are active. He uses a [[Boss Corporation|BOSS]] pedal from the '70s, the Chorus Ensemble CE-1, which can be heard in \"[[Sheer Heart Attack|In The Lap of The Gods]]\" (''[[Live at Wembley '86]]'') or \"[[Hammer to Fall]]\" (slow version played live with P.&nbsp;Rodgers). Next in the chain, he uses a Foxx Foot Phaser (\"We Will Rock You\", \"We Are the Champions\", \"Keep Yourself Alive\", etc.), and two delay machines to play his trademark solo in \"Brighton Rock\".\n\n====Piano and other instruments====\nAs a child, May was trained on classical piano. Although Freddie Mercury was the band's primary pianist, May would occasionally step in (such as on \"[[Save Me (Queen song)|Save Me]]\" and \"[[Flash (Queen song)|Flash]]\"). He mostly used Freddie Mercury's 1972 Steinway piano. From 1979 onwards, he also played synthesisers, organ (\"Wedding March\", \"[[Let Me Live]]\") and programmed drum-machines for both Queen and outside projects (such as producing other artists and his own solo records). In the studio, May used [[Yamaha DX7]] synths for the opening sequence of \"[[One Vision]]\" and the backgrounds of \"[[Who Wants to Live Forever]]\" (also on stage), \"[[Scandal (song)|Scandal]]\" and [[The Show Must Go On (Queen song)|\"The Show Must Go On\"]].\n\nThe first instrument May learned to play was the [[Banjo uke|banjolele]]. He used a \"genuine [[George Formby]] Ukulele-Banjo\" in \"[[Bring Back That Leroy Brown]]\" and [[A Night at the Opera (Queen album)|\"Good Company\"]]. Occasionally, May would also record on other string instruments such as harp (one chord per take, then copied and pasted by the engineer to make it sound like a continuous performance) and bass (on some demos and many songs in his solo career, and the Queen + Paul Rodgers album). May was keen on using some toys as instruments as well. He used a [[Yamaha Corporation|Yamaha]] plastic piano in \"[[Teo Torriatte]]\" and a toy mini [[koto (musical instrument)|koto]] in [[A Night at the Opera (Queen album)|\"The Prophet's Song\"]].\n\n====Vocals====\nMay is also an accomplished singer. From Queen's ''[[Queen II]]'' to ''[[The Game (Queen album)|The Game]]'', May contributed lead vocals to at least one song per album. May co-composed a mini-opera with [[Lee Holdridge]], ''Il Colosso'', for [[Steve Barron]]'s 1996 film, ''[[The Adventures of Pinocchio (1996 film)|The Adventures of Pinocchio]]''.  May performed the opera with [[Jerry Hadley]], [[Sissel Kyrkjebo]], and [[Just William]].  On-screen, it was performed entirely by puppets.\n\n==Scientific career==\n[[File:Rock Star and Astrophysicist Brian May Visits Paranal.jpg|thumbnail|May in 2015 at [[Paranal Observatory]]]]\n{{See also|List of celebrities with advanced degrees}}\nMay studied physics and mathematics at [[Imperial College London]], graduating with a BSc (Hons) degree and [[Associate of the Royal College of Science|ARCS]] in physics with [[Second-class honours|Upper Second-Class Honours]].

Harold May''', {{post-nominals|country=GBR|size=100%|CBE}} (born 19 July 1947) is an English musician, singer, songwriter and astrophysicist. He is the lead guitarist of the rock band [[Queen (band)|Queen]]. His songs include \"[[We Will Rock You]]\", \"[[Tie Your Mother Down]]\", \"[[I Want It All (Queen song)|I Want It All]]\", \"[[Fat Bottomed Girls]]\", \"[[Flash (Queen song)|Flash]]\", \"[[Hammer to Fall]]\", \"[[Save Me (Queen song)|Save Me]]\", \"[[Who Wants to Live Forever]]\" and \"[[The Show Must Go On (Queen song)|The Show Must Go On]]\".\n\nMay was a co-founder of Queen with lead singer [[Freddie Mercury]] and drummer [[Roger Taylor (Queen drummer)|Roger Taylor]], having previously performed with Taylor in the band [[Smile (band)|Smile]], which he had joined while he was at university. Within five years of their formation in 1970 and the recruitment of bass player [[John Deacon]] completing the lineup, Queen had become one of the biggest rock bands in the world with the success of the album ''[[A Night at the Opera (Queen album)|A Night at the Opera]]'' and its single \"[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]\". From the mid-1970s until the early 1990s, Queen were an almost constant presence in the UK charts and played some of the biggest venues in the world, most notably giving an acclaimed performance at [[Live Aid]] in 1985. As a member of Queen, May became regarded as a virtuoso musician and he was identified with a distinctive sound created through his layered guitar work, often using a home-built electric guitar called the [[Red Special]].<ref name=redspecial>{{cite book |last1=May|first1=Brian |authorlink1= Brian May|last2=Bradley |first2=Simon |title=Brian May's Red Special  |date=2014 |publisher=Prion Books |isbn=978-1-78097-276-3 }}</ref>\n\nFollowing the death of Mercury in 1991, aside from the [[The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert|1992 tribute concert]], the release of ''[[Made in Heaven]]'' (1995) and the 1997 tribute single to Mercury, \"[[No-One but You (Only the Good Die Young)]]\" (written by May), Queen were put on hiatus for several years but were eventually reconvened by May and Taylor for further performances featuring other vocalists.

On 21 and 22 April in Los Angeles, May was in the studio with [[Eddie Van Halen]], with no intentions of recording anything; the result of those days was a mini album entitled ''[[Star Fleet Project]]'', which originally wasn't going to be released. In 1986, May contributed to former [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]] guitarist [[Steve Hackett]]'s album ''[[Feedback 86]]'', playing guitar on the track \"Cassandra\" and providing guitar and vocals for \"Slot Machine,\" the latter co-written by May. Although produced in 1986, the album was not issued as a commercial release until 2000. In the same year, May worked with actress [[Anita Dobson]] on her first album, most noted for the song \"Anyone Can Fall in Love\", which added lyrics to the ''[[EastEnders]]'' theme tune and reached no. 4 in the [[UK Singles Chart]] in August 1986.

An earlier version of the band was loosely formed for 19 October 1991, the date of the band's last concert of reunion, when May took part in the ''Guitar Legends'' guitar festival in [[Seville]], Spain. The line-up for his performance was May on vocals and lead guitar, [[Cozy Powell]] on drums and percussion, [[Mike Moran (music producer)|Mike Moran]] and [[Rick Wakeman]] on keyboards, and [[Maggie Ryder]], [[Miriam Stockley]] and [[Chris Thompson (English musician)|Chris Thompson]] on backing vocals. The original line-up was May on vocals and lead guitar, Powell on drums and percussion, [[Michael Casswell]] on guitar, [[Neil Murray (British musician)|Neil Murray]] on bass, and Ryder, Stockley and Thompson on backing vocals. This version of the band lasted only during the South American support tour (supporting [[The B-52's]] and [[Joe Cocker]]) on only five dates.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Lemieux|first1=Patrick|title=The Queen Chronology|date=2018|publisher=Lulu|page=137|edition=2nd}}</ref>\n\nAfterwards, May made significant changes, feeling the group never quite gelled. May brought guitarist [[Jamie Moses]] on board to replace Mike Caswell. The other change made was in the backing vocals department, when Ryder, Stockley and Thompson were replaced with [[Catherine Porter]] and [[Shelley Preston]]. On 23 February 1993, this new line-up of The Brian May Band began its world tour in the US, both supporting [[Guns N' Roses]] and headlining a few dates.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ultimatequeen.co.uk/live/brian.htm#1993bttlnorthamerica1|title=1993 Back To The Light North American Tour (1st leg)|publisher=Ultimatequeen.co.uk|accessdate=27 September 2014}}</ref> The tour would take them through North America, Europe (support act: Valentine) and Japan.

May subsequently changed the approach from covers to focus on those collaborations and on new material. The songs included ''[[Another World (Brian May album)|Another World]]'', and featured mainly [[Spike Edney]], Cozy Powell, Neil Murray and Jamie Moses. On 5 April 1998, Cozy Powell was killed in a car accident on the [[M4 motorway]] near [[Bristol]], England. This caused huge unexpected disruption to the upcoming tour for The Brian May Band, with a new drummer being needed at short notice. [[Steve Ferrone]] was brought on to help May finish recording drums and to join the band for the early stage promotional tour of five dates in Europe before the world tour. Following the early promotional tour, [[Eric Singer]] replaced Steve Ferrone for the full 1998 world tour.\n\nThe 1998 tour saw the brief introduction of a 'support act' known as T. E. Conway.  Conway (Brian May in a wig and colourful suit playing the part of a [[teddy boy]] crooner) would play a number of 1950s [[rock and roll]] standards prior to May's 'arrival'.  A bonus T. E. Conway EP entitled ''Retro Rock Special'' was attached to some pressings of the ''Another World'' album.  The Conway character was retired at the end of the tour.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/artists/brian-may-guide-queen-guitarists-eccentricities-obessions/|first=Adam|last=White|title=From badgers to flamboyant alter egos: a guide to the strange obsessions of Queen's Brian May|date=19 July 2017|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph}}</ref>\nIn May 1999, May recorded lead guitars for the [[Guns N' Roses]] song \"Catcher in the Rye\" on ''[[Chinese Democracy]]'', however, his performance was removed from the album by the time it was released in 2008.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/nov/07/brian-may-chinese-democracy|title=Brian May dropped from Guns N' Roses album|last=Anthony|first=James|date=7 November 2008|website=The Guardian}}</ref>\n\n===2000\u20132004===\n[[File:Queen 2005 1010016.JPG|thumb|May performing in Frankfurt in 2005.]]\nFrom his last solo release in 1998, May has been performing as a solo artist, as part of an ensemble, and infrequently as Queen with Roger Taylor.

Examples are found in Queen's albums ''A Night at the Opera'' and ''A Day at the Races'', where he arranged a jazz band for guitar mini-orchestra (\"Good Company\"), a vocal canon (\"The Prophet's Song\") and guitar and vocal counterpoints (\"[[Teo Torriatte]]\").\n\nMay explored a wide variety of styles in guitar, including [[sweep picking]] (\"[[Was It All Worth It]]\", \"Chinese Torture\"), [[tremolo]] (\"Brighton Rock\", \"[[Stone Cold Crazy]]\", \"[[Death on Two Legs (Dedicated to...)|Death on Two Legs]]\", \"[[Sweet Lady (Queen song)|Sweet Lady]]\", \"Bohemian Rhapsody\", \"[[Get Down Make Love]]\", \"[[Dragon Attack]]\"), [[tapping]] (\"[[Bijou (Queen song)|Bijou]]\", \"[[It's Late]]\", \"[[Resurrection]]\", \"Cyborg\", \"Rain Must Fall\", \"Business\", \"China Belle\", \"I Was Born To Love You\"), slide guitar (\"Drowse\", \"Tie Your Mother Down\"), [[Jimi Hendrix|Hendrix]] sounding licks (\"[[Liar (Queen song)|Liar]]\", \"Brighton Rock\"), tape-delay (\"Brighton Rock\", \"White Man\") and melodic sequences (\"Bohemian Rhapsody\", \"[[Killer Queen]]\", \"[[These Are the Days of Our Lives]]\"). Some of his solos and orchestral parts were composed by [[Freddie Mercury]], who then asked May to bring them to life (\"Bicycle Race\", \"Lazing on a Sunday Afternoon\", \"Killer Queen\", \"[[Good Old Fashioned Lover Boy]]\"). May also performed notable acoustic works, including the finger-picked solo of \"White Queen\" (from ''[[Queen II]]''),  \"[[Love of My Life (Queen song)|Love of My Life]]\" and the [[skiffle]]-influenced \"'39\" (both from ''A Night at the Opera'').\n\nAided by the uniqueness of the Red Special, May was often able to create strange and unusual sound effects. For example, he was able to imitate an orchestra in the song \"[[Queen II#Procession|Procession]]\"; in \"[[Get Down, Make Love]]\" he was able to create various sound effects with his guitar; in \"[[Good Company (Queen song)|Good Company]]\" he used his guitar to mimic a trombone, a piccolo and several other instruments for the song's Dixieland jazz band feel. Queen used a \"No synthesizers were used on this album\" sleeve note on their early albums to make this clear to the listeners.<ref>Cunningham, Mark (October 1995).

The most famous replicas were made by John Birch in 1975 (May actually smashed it during a concert in the States in 1982), [[Greco guitars|Greco]] BM90 (featured in the promo video of \"Good Old-Fashioned Lover Boy\" in 1977), Guild (back-up from 1984 to 1993), Fryers (1997\u20131998, used both live and in the studio) and Guyton<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guytonguitars.com/rsintro.php |title=Guitar Builder (Luthier) in East Anglia, UK \u2013 High Quality Hand Made Custom Electric Guitars by Andrew Guyton |publisher=Guytonguitars.com |accessdate=15 July 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203025707/http://www.guytonguitars.com/rsintro.php |archivedate=3 February 2014 }}</ref> (back-up from 2003 to present). On stage, May used to carry at least one back-up guitar (in case he broke a string) and occasionally would use others for certain songs or parts, such as alternate tunings. Currently, May owns a company which makes guitars whose design is modelled after the original Red Special guitar.\n\n*July 1973&nbsp;\u2013 May 1974: [[Fender Stratocaster]] CBS era (thought to be a 1972)\n*October 1974&nbsp;\u2013 May 1975: [[Gibson Les Paul]] Deluxe, and the Stratocaster from the previous tour.\n*November 1975&nbsp;\u2013 May 1976: Same two guitars as before, plus a natural finish John Birch replica of the Red Special.\n*September 1976: Same three as before, plus a Martin D-18 acoustic for \"'39\".\n*January 1977&nbsp;\u2013 August 1979: Just the Birch replica plus an Ovation Pacemaker 12-string acoustic on some numbers (\"'39\", \"Love of My Life\", \"Dreamer's Ball\").\n*November 1979&nbsp;\u2013 June 1982: Birch replica (back-up), [[Fender Telecaster]] (\"Crazy Little Thing Called Love\" 2nd verse, middle-eight and solo), Ovation (acoustic numbers).\n*July&nbsp;\u2013 November 1982: Added a [[Gibson Flying V]] as second back-up. On 9 August 1982 May smashed the Birch guitar, so the Flying&nbsp;V became the only spare.\n*August&nbsp;\u2013 October 1984: The Flying V became a second back-up again as his main spare was the Guild replica. He also used Roger Taylor's Gibson Chet-Atkins Classical Electric.\n*July 1985&nbsp;\u2013 August 1986: Gibson Flying V no longer used. The rest remained the same.\n*In 2012 he received a double-neck replica of the Red Special with the second neck having 12-strings. He used this guitar at a few gigs with [[Adam Lambert]] now being able to play the 12-string part from the studio version of \"Under Pressure\" live.<ref name=\"Double-neck Red Special\">{{cite web|url=http://www.musicradar.com/guitarist/brian-mays-guyton-double-neck-549856|title=Brian May's Guyton Double Neck|author=Simon Bradley|publisher=Musicradar.com|accessdate=27 September 2014}}</ref>\n\nHe currently has a Guild 12-string to replace his Ovation Pacemaker. Some of the non-RS electric guitars he used in the studio included:\n*[[Burns London|Burns]] Double Six on \"Long Away\" (1976) and \"Under Pressure\" (1981).\n*Fender Telecaster on \"Crazy Little Thing Called Love\" (1979). It was used for the video (but not the recordings) of \"Back Chat\" (1982).\n*Gibson Firebird on \"Hammer to Fall\" and \"Tear It Up\" (album versions only, not on stage).\n*[[Ibanez JS Series|Ibanez JS]] on \"Nothing But Blue\" (1991).\n*[[Parker Fly]] on \"Mother Love\" (1993\u20131995).\n\nFor acoustic, he favoured Ovation, Martin, [[T\u014dkai Guitars|T\u014dkai]] Hummingbird, Godin and Guild. On a couple of videos, he also used some different electric guitars: a Stratocaster copy on \"Play the Game\" (1980) and a [[Washburn RR-V Tour Series|Washburn RR2V]] on \"Princes of the Universe\" (1986).\n\nIn 1984, [[Guild Guitar Company|Guild]] released the first official Red Special replica for mass production, and made some prototypes specifically for May. However, the solid body construction (the original RS has hollow cavities in the body) and the pick-ups (DiMarzio) that were not an exact replica of the Burns TriSonic did not make May happy, so the production stopped after just 300&nbsp;guitars. In 1993, Guild made a second replica of the RS, made in just 1000&nbsp;copies, of which May has some and used as a back-up. At the moment, he uses the two guitars made by Greg Fryer\u2014the luthier who restored the Old Lady in 1998\u2014as back-up. They are almost identical to the original, except for the Fryer logo on the headstock (May's original one has a sixpence).\n\n====Amplifiers and effects====\n[[File:VOX AC30 Twin.jpg|thumb|The [[Vox AC30]] amplifier]]\n{{Quote box\n | quote  = I've never heard a guitar sound so loud!

January 2014)</ref> His choice is the model AC30TBX, the top-boost version with Blue Alnico speakers, and he runs the amp at full volume on the Normal channel.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brianmaycentral.net/bms.html |title=Vox AC30 Brian May |publisher=Brianmaycentral.net |accessdate=27 September 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141029011512/http://www.brianmaycentral.net/bms.html |archivedate=29 October 2014  }}</ref>\n\nMay also customises his amps by removing the circuitry for the Brilliant and Vib-trem channels (leaving only the circuitry for the Normal), and this alters the tone slightly, with a gain addition of 6\u20137&nbsp;dB. He always used a [[treble booster]] which, along with the AC30 and his custom '[[Deacy Amp]]' transistor amp, built by Queen bass player John Deacon, went a long way in helping to create many of his signature guitar tones.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://queenwillrockyou.weebly.com/deacy-amp.html|title=The Legendary Deacy Amp|publisher=queenwillrockyou.weebly.com}}</ref> He used the Dallas Rangemaster for the first Queen albums, up to ''[[A Day at the Races (album)|A Day at the Races]]''. Effects designer [[Pete Cornish]] built for him the TB-83 (32&nbsp;dB of gain) that was used for all the remaining Queen albums. He switched in 2000 to the Fryer's booster, which actually gives less boost than the TB-83.\n\nWhen performing live, May uses banks of Vox AC30 amplifiers, keeping some amps with only guitar and others with all effects such as delay, flanger and chorus. He has a rack of 14&nbsp;AC30s, which are grouped as Normal, Chorus, Delay&nbsp;1, Delay&nbsp;2. On his pedal board, May has a custom switch unit made by Cornish and subsequently modified by Fryer that allows him to choose which amps are active. He uses a [[Boss Corporation|BOSS]] pedal from the '70s, the Chorus Ensemble CE-1, which can be heard in \"[[Sheer Heart Attack|In The Lap of The Gods]]\" (''[[Live at Wembley '86]]'') or \"[[Hammer to Fall]]\" (slow version played live with P.&nbsp;Rodgers). Next in the chain, he uses a Foxx Foot Phaser (\"We Will Rock You\", \"We Are the Champions\", \"Keep Yourself Alive\", etc.), and two delay machines to play his trademark solo in \"Brighton Rock\".\n\n====Piano and other instruments====\nAs a child, May was trained on classical piano. Although Freddie Mercury was the band's primary pianist, May would occasionally step in (such as on \"[[Save Me (Queen song)|Save Me]]\" and \"[[Flash (Queen song)|Flash]]\"). He mostly used Freddie Mercury's 1972 Steinway piano. From 1979 onwards, he also played synthesisers, organ (\"Wedding March\", \"[[Let Me Live]]\") and programmed drum-machines for both Queen and outside projects (such as producing other artists and his own solo records). In the studio, May used [[Yamaha DX7]] synths for the opening sequence of \"[[One Vision]]\" and the backgrounds of \"[[Who Wants to Live Forever]]\" (also on stage), \"[[Scandal (song)|Scandal]]\" and [[The Show Must Go On (Queen song)|\"The Show Must Go On\"]].\n\nThe first instrument May learned to play was the [[Banjo uke|banjolele]]. He used a \"genuine [[George Formby]] Ukulele-Banjo\" in \"[[Bring Back That Leroy Brown]]\" and [[A Night at the Opera (Queen album)|\"Good Company\"]]. Occasionally, May would also record on other string instruments such as harp (one chord per take, then copied and pasted by the engineer to make it sound like a continuous performance) and bass (on some demos and many songs in his solo career, and the Queen + Paul Rodgers album). May was keen on using some toys as instruments as well. He used a [[Yamaha Corporation|Yamaha]] plastic piano in \"[[Teo Torriatte]]\" and a toy mini [[koto (musical instrument)|koto]] in [[A Night at the Opera (Queen album)|\"The Prophet's Song\"]].\n\n====Vocals====\nMay is also an accomplished singer. From Queen's ''[[Queen II]]'' to ''[[The Game (Queen album)|The Game]]'', May contributed lead vocals to at least one song per album. May co-composed a mini-opera with [[Lee Holdridge]], ''Il Colosso'', for [[Steve Barron]]'s 1996 film, ''[[The Adventures of Pinocchio (1996 film)|The Adventures of Pinocchio]]''.  May performed the opera with [[Jerry Hadley]], [[Sissel Kyrkjebo]], and [[Just William]].  On-screen, it was performed entirely by puppets.\n\n==Scientific career==\n[[File:Rock Star and Astrophysicist Brian May Visits Paranal.jpg|thumbnail|May in 2015 at [[Paranal Observatory]]]]\n{{See also|List of celebrities with advanced degrees}}\nMay studied physics and mathematics at [[Imperial College London]], graduating with a BSc (Hons) degree and [[Associate of the Royal College of Science|ARCS]] in physics with [[Second-class honours|Upper Second-Class Honours]].

There is diversity even within languages. In English, the Netherlands is also called [[Holland]] or (part of) [[the Low Countries]], whereas the term ''\"[[Dutch language|Dutch]]\"'' is used as the [[demonym]] and adjectival form. \n\n===The Netherlands and the Low Countries===\nThe region called the [[Low Countries]] (comprising [[Belgium]], the Netherlands and [[Luxembourg]]) and the Country of the Netherlands, have the same [[toponymy]]. Place names with ''Neder'' (or ''lage''), ''Nieder'', ''Nether'' (or ''low'') and ''Nedre'' (in [[Germanic languages]]) and ''Bas'' or ''Inferior'' (in [[Romance languages]]) are in use in places all over Europe. They are sometimes used in a [[deictic]] relation to a higher ground that consecutively is indicated as ''Upper'', ''Boven'', ''Oben'', ''Superior'' or ''Haut''. In the case of the Low Countries / Netherlands the geographical location of the ''lower'' region has been more or less downstream and near the sea. The geographical location of the upper region, however, changed tremendously over time, depending on the location of the economic and military power governing the Low Countries area. The [[Roman Empire|Romans]] made a distinction between the Roman provinces of downstream [[Germania Inferior]] (nowadays part of Belgium and the Netherlands) and upstream [[Germania Superior]] (nowadays part of Germany). The designation 'Low' to refer to the region returns again in the 10th century Duchy of [[Lower Lorraine]], that covered much of the Low Countries.<ref name=\"Franks (Columbia Encyclopedia)\">{{cite web |url = http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Franks.aspx |title=Franks |publisher=[[Columbia University Press]] |encyclopedia=[[Columbia Encyclopedia]] |year=2013 |accessdate=1 February 2014 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url = http://nobhist.narod.ru/lorraine.html |title=Lotharingia / Lorraine (Lothringen) |date=5 September 2013 |accessdate=1 February 2014 }}</ref> But this time the corresponding ''Upper'' region is [[Upper Lorraine]], in nowadays Northern France.\n\nThe [[Dukes of Burgundy]], who ruled the Low Countries in the 15th century, used the term ''les pays de par de\u00e7\u00e0'' (\"the lands over here\") for the Low Countries as opposed to ''les pays de par del\u00e0'' (\"the lands over there\") for their original homeland: [[Burgundy]] in present-day east-central France.<ref name=\"BlockmansPrevenier2010\">{{cite book |author1=Wim Blockmans |author2=Walter Prevenier |title = The Promised Lands: The Low Countries Under Burgundian Rule, 1369-1530 |url = https://books.google.com/?id=0Foy9GGgdcgC&pg=PA85&dq=duke+pays+de+par+de\u00e7\u00e0#v=onepage&q=duke%20pays%20de%20par%20de\u00e7\u00e0&f=false |date=3 August 2010 |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |isbn=978-0-8122-0070-6 |pages=85\u2013 }}</ref> Under [[Habsburg Netherlands|Habsburg rule]], ''Les pays de par de\u00e7\u00e0'' developed in ''pays d'embas'' (\"lands down-here\"),<ref>{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/?id=59Pae06JSiUC&lpg=PP1&dq=The%20New%20Cambridge%20Modern%20History%3A%20Volume%202%2C%20The%20Reformation%2C%201520-1559&pg=PA342#v=onepage&q=The%20New%20Cambridge%20Modern%20History:%20Volume%202,%20The%20Reformation,%201520-1559&f=false |title = The New Cambridge Modern History: Volume 2, The Reformation, 1520\u20131559 |isbn = 9780521345361 |last1 = Elton |first1 = Geoffrey Rudolph |year = 1990 }}</ref> a deictic expression in relation to other Habsburg possessions like Hungary and Austria.

The area known as ''Oberland'' (High country) was in this deictic context considered to begin approximately at the nearby higher located [[Cologne]].\n\nFrom the mid-sixteenth century on, the \"Low Countries\" and the \"Netherlands\" lost their original deictic meaning. They were probably the most commonly used names, besides [[Flanders]], a ''[[pars pro toto]]'' for the Low Countries, especially in Romance language speaking Europe. The [[Eighty Years' War]] (1568\u20131648) divided the Low Countries into an independent northern [[Dutch Republic]] (or [[Latinisation of names|Latinised]] ''Belgica Foederata'', \"Federated Netherlands\", the precursor state of the Netherlands) and a Spanish controlled [[Southern Netherlands]] (Latinised ''Belgica Regia'', \"Royal Netherlands\", the precursor state of Belgium). The Low Countries today is a designation that includes the countries of the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg, although in most [[Romance languages]], the term \"Low Countries\" is used as the name for the Netherlands specifically. It is used synonymous with the more neutral and geopolitical term [[Benelux]].\n\n===Holland===\nThe Netherlands is also referred to as [[Holland]] in various languages, including English. The region of Holland proper consists of [[North Holland|North]] and [[South Holland]], two of the nation's twelve provinces, formerly a single province, and earlier still, the [[County of Holland]], a remnant of the dissolved [[Frisian Kingdom]]. Following the decline of the [[Duchy of Brabant]] and the [[County of Flanders]], Holland became the most economically and politically important county in the [[Low Countries]] region. The emphasis on Holland during the formation of the [[Dutch Republic]], the [[Eighty Years' War]], and the [[Anglo-Dutch Wars]] in the 16th, 17th, and 18th century, made Holland serve as a ''[[pars pro toto]]'' for the entire country, which is now considered informal<ref>{{cite news |url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/topics/about-us/style-book/1435302/Telegraph-style-book-places-and-peoples.html |title=Telegraph style book: places and peoples |accessdate=31 March 2014 |location=London |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=12 April 2008 }}</ref> or incorrect.<ref>{{cite news |url = http://handbook.reuters.com/index.php?title=H#Holland |title=The Reuters Style Guide |accessdate=31 March 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.media.uoa.gr/lectures/linguistic_archives/academic_papers0506/notes/stylesheets_3.pdf|title=The BBC News Styleguide|accessdate=31 March 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120227003642/http://www2.media.uoa.gr/lectures/linguistic_archives/academic_papers0506/notes/stylesheets_3.pdf|archive-date=27 February 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> The use of the term Holland when referring to the whole of the Netherlands is disliked by many Dutch people.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}} Nonetheless, the name \"Holland\" is still widely used for the [[Netherlands national football team]], including in the Netherlands,<ref>{{cite news |url = http://image.guardian.co.uk/sys-files/Guardian/documents/2004/07/15/styleguidepdfjuly2004.pdf |title=The Guardian style guide |accessdate=31 March 2014 |location=London }}</ref> and the Dutch government's international websites for tourism and trade are \"holland.com\" and \"hollandtradeandinvest.com\".<ref>[http://www.netherlands-tourism.com/netherlands-holland/ ''Netherlands Tourism''] \"Holland vs Netherlands \u2013 Is the Netherlands the same as Holland?\"</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://exploreholland.nl/holland-vs-netherlands/|title=Holland vs Netherlands: Everything you need to know|date=2020-01-17|website=Explore Holland|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-17}}</ref> In 2020, however, the Dutch government has announced that it will only communicate and advertise under the name \"the Netherlands\" in the future.<ref>{{cite news |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/13/world/europe/holland-netherlands-new-name.html |title=Why Dutch Officials Want You to Forget the Country of Holland|date=13 January 2020|website=The New York Times|accessdate=15 January 2020|location=New York City }}</ref>\n\n===Dutch===\nThe term Dutch is used as the demonymic and adjectival form of the Netherlands in the English language. The origins of the word go back to Proto-Germanic ''*\u00feiudiskaz'', meaning \"popular\" or \"of the people\"; akin to Old Dutch ''dietsc'', Old High German ''diutsch'', and Old English ''\u00feeodisc'', all meaning \"(of) the common (Germanic) people\". At first, the English language used (the contemporary form of) Dutch to refer to any or all speakers of West Germanic languages (e.g. the Dutch, the Frisians, and the Germans). Gradually its meaning shifted to the West Germanic people they had most contact with, because of their geographical proximity and for the rivalry in trade and overseas territories. The derivative of the Proto-Germanic word ''*\u00feiudiskaz'' in modern Dutch, ''Diets'', can be found in Dutch literature as a poetic name for the Dutch people or language, but is considered very archaic. It is still used in the expression \"diets maken\" - to put it straight to him/her (as in a threat) or, more neutral, to make it clear, understandable, explain, say in the people's language (cf. the Vulgate (Bible not in Greek or Hebrew, but Latin; the folks' language) in meaning vulgar, though not in a pejorative sense).\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of the Netherlands}}\n\n===Prehistory (before 800 BCE)===\n{{Main|Paleolithic Europe|Neolithic Europe|Bronze Age Europe}}\n[[File:Mannetje van Willemstad.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Oak figurine found in [[Willemstad, North Brabant|Willemstad]] (4500 BCE)]]\nThe prehistory of the area that is now the Netherlands was largely shaped by the sea and the rivers that constantly shifted the low-lying geography.

However, as of 843, it was divided into three parts\u2014[[East Francia|East]], [[Middle Francia|Middle]], and [[West Francia]]. Most of present-day Netherlands became part of [[Middle Francia]], which was a weak kingdom and subject of numerous partitions and annexation attempts by its stronger neighbours. It comprised territories from [[Frisia]] in the north to the [[Kingdom of Italy (medieval)|Kingdom of Italy]] in the south. Around 850, [[Lothair I]] of Middle Francia acknowledged the Viking [[Rorik of Dorestad]] as ruler of most of Frisia.<ref>Baldwin, Stewart, [http://archiver.rootsweb.ancestry.com/th/read/GEN-MEDIEVAL/2002-09/1031544685 \"Danish Haralds in 9th Century Frisia\"]. Retrieved 9 October 2011.</ref> When the kingdom of Middle Francia was partitioned in 855, the lands north of the [[Alps]] passed to [[Lothair II of Lotharingia|Lothair II]] and subsequently were named [[Lotharingia]]. After he died in 869, Lotharingia was partitioned, into [[Upper Lotharingia|Upper]] and [[Lower Lotharingia]], the latter part comprising the Low Countries that technically became part of [[East Francia]] in 870, although it was effectively under the control of Vikings, who raided the largely defenceless [[Frisians|Frisian]] and [[Franks|Frankish]] towns lying on the Frisian coast and along the rivers. Around 879, another Viking raided the Frisian lands, [[Godfrid, Duke of Frisia]]. The Viking raids made the sway of French and German lords in the area weak. Resistance to the Vikings, if any, came from local nobles, who gained in stature as a result, and that laid the basis for the disintegration of Lower Lotharingia into semi-independent states. One of these local nobles was [[Gerolf of Holland]], who assumed lordship in Frisia after he helped to assassinate Godfrid, and Viking rule came to an end.\n\n===High Middle Ages (1000\u20131384)===\n{{Main|History of urban centers in the Low Countries}}\nThe [[Holy Roman Empire]] (the successor state of East Francia and then Lotharingia) ruled much of the Low Countries in the 10th and 11th century, but was not able to maintain political unity. Powerful local nobles turned their cities, counties and duchies into private kingdoms that felt little sense of obligation to the emperor. [[County of Holland|Holland]], [[County of Hainaut|Hainaut]], [[County of Flanders|Flanders]], [[Duchy of Gelre|Gelre]], [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]], and [[Bishopric of Utrecht|Utrecht]] were in a state of almost continual war or in paradoxically formed personal unions. The language and culture of most of the people who lived in the County of Holland were originally [[Frisia]]n. As Frankish settlement progressed from Flanders and Brabant, the area quickly became [[Old Low Franconian]] (or [[Old Dutch]]). The rest of [[Frisia]] in the north (now [[Friesland]] and [[Groningen (province)|Groningen]]) continued to maintain its independence and had its own institutions (collectively called the \"[[Frisian freedom]]\"), which resented the imposition of the feudal system.\n\nAround 1000 AD, due to several agricultural developments, the economy started to develop at a fast pace, and the higher productivity allowed workers to farm more land or to become tradesmen. Towns grew around [[monasteries]] and [[castles]], and a mercantile middle class began to develop in these urban areas, especially in Flanders and later also Brabant. Wealthy cities started to buy certain [[City rights in the Low Countries|privileges]] for themselves from the [[monarch|sovereign]]. In practice, this meant that [[Brugge]] and [[Antwerp]] became quasi-independent republics in their own right and would later develop into some of the most important cities and ports in Europe.\n\nAround 1100 AD, farmers from [[County of Flanders|Flanders]] and [[Bishopric of Utrecht|Utrecht]] began draining and cultivating uninhabited swampy land in the western Netherlands, making the emergence of the County of Holland as the centre of power possible. The title of [[Count of Holland]] was fought over in the [[Hook and Cod Wars]] ({{lang-nl|Hoekse en Kabeljauwse twisten}}) between 1350 and 1490. The Cod faction consisted of the more progressive cities, while the Hook faction consisted of the conservative noblemen. These noblemen invited the Duke [[Philip the Good]] of Burgundy \u2014 who was also Count of Flanders \u2014 to conquer Holland.\n\n===Burgundian, Habsburg and Spanish Habsburg Netherlands (1384\u20131581)===\n{{Main|Burgundian Netherlands|Habsburg Netherlands|Spanish Netherlands}}\n{{multiple image|perrow=1/2/1|align=left|total_width=250|caption_align=center\n| title = Spanish Netherlands\n| image1 = Van Soest, Four Days Battle.jpg|caption1=''The [[Four Days' Battle]], 1\u20134 June 1666'' ([[Second Anglo\u2013Dutch War]]) by [[Pieter Cornelisz van Soest]]\n| image2 = Political map of the Low Countries (1350)-NL.svg|caption2=The Low Countries in the late 14th century\n| image3 = William I, Prince of Orange by Adriaen Thomasz.

The [[House of Valois-Burgundy]] and their [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]] heirs would rule the Low Countries in the period from 1384 to 1581. Before the Burgundian union, the Dutch identified themselves by the town they lived in or their local duchy or county. The Burgundian period is when the road to nationhood began. The new rulers defended Dutch trading interests, which then developed rapidly. The fleets of the [[County of Holland]] defeated the fleets of the [[Hanseatic League]] several times. [[Amsterdam]] grew and in the 15th century became the primary trading port in Europe for grain from the [[Baltic region]]. Amsterdam distributed grain to the major cities of Belgium, Northern France and England. This trade was vital, because Holland could no longer produce enough grain to feed itself. Land drainage had caused the [[peat]] of the former [[wetland]]s to reduce to a level that was too low for drainage to be maintained.\n\nUnder Habsburg [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], ruler of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] and King of [[Habsburg Spain|Spain]], all fiefs in the current Netherlands region were united into the [[Seventeen Provinces]], which also included most of present-day Belgium, Luxembourg, and some adjacent land in what is now France and Germany. In 1568, the [[Eighty Years' War]] between the Provinces and their [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] ruler began. The level of ferocity exhibited by both sides can be gleaned from a Dutch chronicler's report:<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/risedutchrepubl01motlgoog|quote=On more than one occasion men were seen hanging their own brothers, who had been taken prisoners in the enemy's ranks....

Most of the areas below sea level are man-made, caused by [[peat]] extraction or achieved through [[land reclamation]]. Since the late 16th century, large [[polder]] areas are preserved through elaborate drainage systems that include [[dike (construction)|dikes]], canals and pumping stations. Nearly 17% of the country's land area is reclaimed from the sea and from lakes.\n\nMuch of the country was originally formed by the [[estuary|estuaries]] of three large European rivers: the [[Rhine]] (''Rijn''), the [[Meuse River|Meuse]] (''Maas'') and the [[Scheldt]] (''Schelde''), as well as their [[tributary|tributaries]].

In the past these rivers functioned as a natural barrier between [[fief]]doms and hence historically created a cultural divide, as is evident in some phonetic traits that are recognisable on either side of what the Dutch call their \"Great Rivers\" (''de Grote Rivieren''). Another significant branch of the Rhine, the [[IJssel]] river, discharges into [[IJsselmeer|Lake IJssel]], the former [[Zuiderzee]] ('southern sea'). Just like the previous, this river forms a linguistic divide: people to the northeast of this river speak [[Dutch Low Saxon]] dialects (except for the province of [[Friesland]], which has its own language).<ref name=\"international2000\">Welschen, Ad: Course ''Dutch Society and Culture'', International School for Humanities and Social Studies ISHSS, Universiteit van Amsterdam, 2000\u20132005.</ref>\n\n===Floods===\n{{Main|Flood control in the Netherlands|Floods in the Netherlands|North Sea flood of 1953|Storm tides of the North Sea}}\n[[File:Christmas flood 1717.jpg|thumb|The [[Christmas flood of 1717]] was the result of a northwesterly storm that resulted in the death of thousands.]]\n\nOver the centuries, the Dutch coastline has changed considerably as a result of natural disasters and human intervention.\n\nOn 14 December 1287, [[St. Lucia's flood]] affected the Netherlands and Germany, killing more than 50,000 people in one of the most destructive floods in recorded history.<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1485002/Zuiderzee-floods Zuiderzee floods (Netherlands history)].

The huge [[North Sea flood of 1953|North Sea flood of early February 1953]] caused the collapse of several dikes in the south-west of the Netherlands; more than 1,800 people drowned in the flood. The Dutch government subsequently instituted a large-scale programme, the \"[[Deltawerken|Delta Works]]\", to protect the country against future flooding, which was completed over a period of more than thirty years.\n\n[[File:The Netherlands compared to sealevel.png|thumb|left|Map illustrating areas of the Netherlands below sea level]]\nThe impact of disasters was, to an extent, increased through human activity. Relatively high-lying [[swamp]]land was drained to be used as farmland. The drainage caused the fertile [[peat]] to contract and ground levels to drop, upon which groundwater levels were lowered to compensate for the drop in ground level, causing the underlying peat to contract further. Additionally, until the 19th century peat was mined, dried, and used for fuel, further exacerbating the problem. Centuries of extensive and poorly controlled [[peat]] extraction lowered an already low land surface by several metres. Even in flooded areas, peat extraction continued through turf dredging.\n\nBecause of the flooding, farming was difficult, which encouraged foreign trade, the result of which was that the Dutch were involved in world affairs since the early 14th/15th century.<ref>Duplessis, Robert S. (1997) ''Transitions to Capitalism in Early Modern Europe'', Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|0-521-39773-1}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Netherlands, Zoetermeer, Zoetermeerse Meerpolder (1).JPG|thumb|A polder at 5.53 metres below sea level]]\nTo guard against floods, a series of defences against the water were contrived. In the first millennium [[AD]], villages and farmhouses were built on man-made hills called ''terps''. Later, these terps were connected by dikes. In the 12th century, local government agencies called ''\"[[Water board (Netherlands)|waterschappen]]\"'' (\"water boards\") or ''\"[[Water board (Netherlands)|hoogheemraadschappen]]\"'' (\"high home councils\") started to appear, whose job it was to maintain the water level and to protect a region from floods; these agencies continue to exist. As the ground level dropped, the dikes by necessity grew and merged into an integrated system. By the 13th century [[windmill]]s had come into use to pump water out of areas below sea level. The windmills were later used to drain lakes, creating the famous [[polder]]s.<ref>{{cite web|title=Windmills in Dutch History|url=http://www.let.rug.nl/polders/boekje/history.htm|website=Let.rug.nl|publisher=Rijks Universiteit Groningen|accessdate=7 July 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170705084250/http://www.let.rug.nl/polders/boekje/history.htm|archive-date=5 July 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn 1932 the ''[[Afsluitdijk]]'' (\"Closure Dike\") was completed, blocking the former ''[[Zuiderzee]]'' (Southern Sea) from the North Sea and thus creating the [[IJsselmeer]] ([[IJssel]] Lake).

The project started in 1958 and was largely completed in 1997 with the completion of the [[Maeslantkering]]. Since then, new projects have been periodically started to renovate and renew the Delta Works. A main goal of the Delta project was to reduce the risk of flooding in South Holland and Zeeland to once per 10,000 years (compared to 1 per 4000 years for the rest of the country). This was achieved by raising {{convert|3000|km|mi|0}} of outer sea-dikes and {{convert|10000|km|mi|0}} of inner, canal, and river dikes, and by closing off the sea [[estuary|estuaries]] of the Zeeland province.

The Netherlands is actively preparing for a sea level rise. A politically neutral Delta Commission has formulated an action plan to cope with a sea level rise of {{convert|1.10|m|ft}} and a simultaneous land height decline of {{convert|10|cm|in}}. The plan encompasses the reinforcement of the existing coastal defences like [[Levee|dikes]] and [[dune]]s with {{convert|1.30|m|ft}} of additional flood protection.

To protect the country from river flooding, another program is already being executed. The [[Room for the River (Netherlands)|Room for the River plan]] grants more flow space to rivers, protects the major populated areas and allows for periodic flooding of indefensible lands.

Freezing days\u2014minimum temperature below {{convert|0|C|F|0}}\u2014occur much more often, usually ranging from mid-November to late March, but not rarely measured as early as mid-October and as late as mid-May. If one chooses the height of measurement to be {{convert|10|cm|0|abbr=on}} above ground instead of {{convert|150|cm|0|abbr=on}}, one may even find such temperatures in the middle of the summer. On average, snow can occur from November to April, but sometimes occurs in May or October too.\n\nWarm days\u2014maximum temperature above {{convert|20|C|F|0}}\u2014are usually found in April to October, but in some parts of the country these warm days can also occur in March, or even sometimes in November or February (usually not in {{Not a typo|De Bilt}}, however). Summer days\u2014maximum temperature above {{convert|25|C|F|0}}\u2014are usually measured in {{Not a typo|De Bilt}} from May until September, tropical days\u2014maximum temperature above {{convert|30|C|F|0}}\u2014are rare and usually occur only in June to August.\n\nPrecipitation throughout the year is distributed relatively equally each month. Summer and autumn months tend to gather a little more precipitation than the other months, mainly because of the intensity of the rainfall rather than the frequency of rain days (this is especially the case in summer, when lightning is also much more frequent).\n\nThe number of sunshine hours is affected by the fact that because of the geographical latitude, the length of the days varies between barely eight hours in December and nearly 17 hours in June.\n\nThe following tables are based on mean measurements by the [[KNMI (institute)|KNMI]] weather station in [[De Bilt]] between 1981 and 2010.

Although in the English language they are considered part of the [[Leeward Islands]], French, Spanish, [[Dutch language|Dutch]] and the English spoken locally consider them part of the [[Windward Islands]]. The Windward Islands are all of volcanic origin and hilly, leaving little ground suitable for [[agriculture]]. The highest point is [[Mount Scenery]], {{convert|887|m|ft|0}}, on [[Saba]]. This is the highest point in the country, and is also the highest point of the entire [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]].\n\nThe islands of the Caribbean Netherlands enjoy a [[tropical]] [[climate]] with warm weather all year round.

The Netherlands is described as a [[consociational state]]. Dutch politics and governance are characterised by an effort to achieve broad consensus on important issues, within both the political community and society as a whole. In 2017, ''[[The Economist]]'' ranked the Netherlands as the 11th [[Democracy Index|most democratic country in the world]].\n\nThe [[Dutch monarchy|monarch]] is the [[head of state]], at present King [[Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands]]. Constitutionally, the position is equipped with limited powers.<!-- Commented out: \"The monarch can exert some influence during the formation of a new cabinet, where they serve as neutral arbiter between the political parties.\" INFO: The Dutch Lower House (Tweede Kamer) relieved the monarch of this role on 27 March 2012. --> By law, the King has the right to be periodically briefed and consulted on government affairs. Depending on the personalities and relationships of the King and the ministers, the monarch might have influence beyond the power granted by the [[Constitution of the Netherlands]].\n\n{{multiple image\n | align             = right\n | direction         = horizontal\n | caption_align     = center\n | image1            = Koning-willem-alexander-okt-15-s.jpg\n | width1            = 172\n | caption1          = [[Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands|Willem-Alexander]]<br /><small>[[Monarchy of the Netherlands|King of the Netherlands]]<br />since 30 April 2013</small>\n | image2            = Mark Rutte-6.jpg\n | width2            = 180\n | caption2          = [[Mark Rutte]]<br /><small>[[Prime Minister of the Netherlands]]<br />since 14 October 2010</small>\n}}\nThe [[Executive (government)|executive power]] is formed by the [[Council of Ministers (Netherlands)|Council of Ministers]], the deliberative organ of the [[Cabinet of the Netherlands|Dutch cabinet]]. The cabinet usually consists of 13 to 16 ministers and a varying number of [[State Secretary (Netherlands)|state secretaries]]. One to three ministers are [[Minister without portfolio|ministers without portfolio]]. The [[head of government]] is the [[Prime Minister of the Netherlands]], who often is the leader of the largest party of the coalition. The Prime Minister is a ''[[primus inter pares]]'', with no explicit powers beyond those of the other ministers. [[Mark Rutte]] has been Prime Minister since October 2010; the Prime Minister had been the leader of the largest party continuously since 1973.\n\nThe cabinet is [[Ministerial responsibility|responsible]] to the [[Bicameralism|bicameral]] [[parliament]], the [[States General of the Netherlands|States General]], which also has [[Legislative|legislative powers]]. The 150 members of the [[House of Representatives (Netherlands)|House of Representatives]], the [[lower house]], are elected in [[direct election]]s on the basis of [[party-list proportional representation]]. These are held every four years, or sooner in case the cabinet falls (for example: when one of the chambers carries a [[motion of no confidence]], the cabinet offers its resignation to the monarch). The [[States-Provincial]] are directly elected every four years as well. The members of the provincial assemblies elect the 75 members of the [[Senate (Netherlands)|Senate]], the [[upper house]], which has the power to reject laws, but not propose or amend them. Both houses send members to the [[Benelux Parliament]], a consultative council.\n\n===Political culture===\nBoth trade unions and [[employers organisation]]s are consulted beforehand in policymaking in the financial, economic and social areas. They meet regularly with the government in the [[Social-Economic Council]]. This body advises government and its advice cannot be put aside easily.\n\nThe Netherlands has a long tradition of [[Toleration|social tolerance]].<ref name=\"Singh2010\">{{cite book|author=Shiva Pratap Singh|title=Glimpses of Europe: A Crucible of Winning Ideas, Great Civilizations and Bloodiest Wars|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MPMkaHfHLRgC&pg=PA579|year=2010|publisher=Gyan Publishing House|isbn=978-81-7835-831-4|pages=579\u2013}}</ref> In the 18th century, while the [[Dutch Reformed Church]] was the [[state religion]], [[Roman Catholicism in the Netherlands|Catholicism]], other forms of Protestantism, such as Baptists and Lutherans, as well as [[History of the Jews in the Netherlands|Judaism]] were tolerated but discriminated against.<ref name=\"Singh2010\"/>\n\n[[File:Red-light district of Amsterdam by day. 2012.JPG|thumb|250px|[[De Wallen]], Amsterdam's [[Red-light district]], offers activities such as legal [[Prostitution in the Netherlands|prostitution]] and a number of [[coffee shops]] that sell [[marijuana]], symbolising the Dutch political culture and tradition of tolerance.]]\nIn the late 19th century this Dutch tradition of religious tolerance transformed into a system of [[pillarisation]], in which religious groups coexisted separately and only interacted at the level of government.

Since suffrage became universal [[Pacification of 1917|in 1917]], the Dutch political system has been dominated by three families of political parties: the strongest of which were the [[Christian democracy|Christian Democrats]], currently represented by the [[Christian Democratic Appeal]] (CDA); second were the [[Social democracy|Social Democrats]], represented by the [[Labour Party (Netherlands)|Labour Party]] (PvdA); and third were the [[Liberalism in the Netherlands|Liberals]], of which the right-wing [[People's Party for Freedom and Democracy]] (VVD) is the main representative.\n\nThese parties co-operated in coalition cabinets in which the Christian Democrats had always been a partner: so either a centre-left coalition of the Christian Democrats and Social Democrats was ruling or a centre-right coalition of Christian Democrats and Liberals. In the 1970s, the [[party system]] became more volatile: the Christian Democratic parties lost seats, while new parties became successful, such as the [[Radicalism (historical)|radical democrat]] and [[Progressivism|progressive]] liberal [[Democrats 66]] (D66) or the [[Ecology|ecologist]] party [[GroenLinks]] (GL).\n\nIn the [[Dutch general election, 1994|1994 election]], the CDA lost its dominant position. A \"[[Purple (government)|purple]]\" cabinet was formed by the VVD, D66, and PvdA. In the [[Dutch general election, 2002|2002 elections]], this cabinet lost its majority, because of an increased support for the CDA and the rise of the right [[Lijst Pim Fortuyn|LPF]], a new political party, around [[Pim Fortuyn]], who was assassinated a week before the elections. A short-lived [[First Balkenende cabinet|cabinet]] was formed by CDA, VVD, and LPF, which was led by the CDA Leader [[Jan Peter Balkenende]]. After the [[Dutch general election, 2003|2003 elections]], in which the LPF lost most of its seats, a [[Balkenende II|cabinet]] was formed by the CDA, VVD, and D66. The cabinet initiated an ambitious programme of reforming the [[welfare state]], the [[Healthcare in the Netherlands|healthcare system]], and [[Border control#Immigration policy|immigration policy]].\n\nIn June 2006, the cabinet fell after D66 voted in favour of a motion of no confidence against the [[Ministry of Justice and Security (Netherlands)|Minister of Immigration and Integration]], [[Rita Verdonk]], who had instigated an investigation of the asylum procedure of [[Ayaan Hirsi Ali]], a VVD [[Member of parliament|MP]].

relations===\n{{Main|Foreign relations of the Netherlands|List of diplomatic missions of the Netherlands}}\n[[File:International Court of Justice.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Peace Palace]] (''Vredespaleis''), in [[The Hague]]]]\nThe history of [[foreign relations of the Netherlands|Dutch foreign policy]] has been characterised by its [[neutral state|neutrality]]. Since World War II, the Netherlands has become a member of a large number of international organisations, most prominently the UN, [[NATO]] and the EU. The Dutch economy is very open and relies strongly on [[international trade]].\n\nThe [[foreign policy]] of the Netherlands is based on four basic commitments: to [[atlanticism|Atlantic co-operation]], to [[European integration]], to [[international development]] and to [[international law]]. One of the more controversial international issues surrounding the Netherlands is its [[Drug policy of the Netherlands|liberal policy towards soft drugs]].\n\nDuring and after the [[Dutch Golden Age]], the Dutch people built up a commercial and colonial empire. The most important colonies were present-day [[Suriname]] and [[Indonesia]]. Indonesia became independent after the [[Indonesian National Revolution]] in the 1940s following a war of independence, international pressure and several [[United Nations Security Council resolution]]s. Suriname became independent in 1975. The historical ties inherited from its colonial past still influence the foreign relations of the Netherlands. In addition, many people from these countries are living permanently in the Netherlands.\n\n===Military===\n{{Main|Armed forces of the Netherlands}}\n[[File:Rob Bauer.jpg|thumb|Lieutenant admiral [[Rob Bauer]] is the current [[Chief of Defence (Netherlands)|Chief of Defence]].]]\nThe Netherlands has one of the oldest standing armies in Europe; it was first established as such by [[Maurice of Nassau]] in the late 1500s. The Dutch army was used throughout the [[Dutch Empire]]. After the defeat of Napoleon, the Dutch army was transformed into a [[conscription]] army. The army was unsuccessfully deployed during the [[Belgian Revolution]] in 1830. After 1830, it was deployed mainly in the Dutch colonies, as the Netherlands remained neutral in European wars (including the First World War), until the [[Battle of the Netherlands|Netherlands was invaded in World War II]] and defeated by the Wehrmacht in May 1940.\n\n[[File:HNLMS Holland.jpg|thumb|''Zr. Ms. Holland'', a [[Royal Netherlands Navy]] [[offshore patrol vessel]]]]\nThe Netherlands abandoned its neutrality in 1948 when it signed the [[Treaty of Brussels]], and became a founding member of [[NATO]] in 1949. The Dutch military was therefore part of the NATO strength in [[Cold War]] Europe, deploying its army to several bases in Germany. More than 3,000 Dutch soldiers were assigned to the [[2nd Infantry Division (United States)|2nd Infantry Division]] of the [[United States Army]] during the [[Korean War]]. In 1996 conscription was suspended, and the Dutch army was once again transformed into a professional army. Since the 1990s the Dutch army has been involved in the [[Bosnian War]] and the [[Kosovo War]], it held a province in [[Iraq]] after the defeat of [[Saddam Hussein]], and it was engaged in [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|Afghanistan]].\n\nThe military is composed of four branches, all of which carry the prefix ''Koninklijke'' (Royal):\n<!-- Pls do not change any of these from 'Royal Netherlands' to 'Dutch', the official name of ALL branches of the Army is Royal Netherlands-->\n* ''Koninklijke Marine'' (KM), the [[Royal Netherlands Navy]], including the Naval Air Service and Marine Corps;\n* ''Koninklijke Landmacht'' (KL), the [[Royal Netherlands Army]];\n* ''Koninklijke Luchtmacht'' (KLu), the [[Royal Netherlands Air Force]];\n* ''Koninklijke Marechaussee'' (KMar), the [[Royal Marechaussee]] (Military Police), tasks include military police and border control.\n\nThe submarine service is open to women as of 1 January 2017.

It comprises eight grades, the first of which is facultative. Based on an aptitude test, the eighth grade teacher's recommendation and the opinion of the pupil's parents or caretakers, a choice is made for one of the three main streams of secondary education. After completing a particular stream, a pupil may still continue in the penultimate year of the next stream.\n\nThe [[Voorbereidend middelbaar beroepsonderwijs|VMBO]] has 4 grades and is subdivided over several levels. Successfully completing the vmbo results in a low-level vocational degree that grants access to the MBO. The MBO (middle-level applied education) is a form of education primarily focuses on teaching a practical trade, or a vocational degree. With the MBO certification, a student can apply for the HBO. The [[Hoger algemeen voortgezet onderwijs|HAVO]] has 5 grades and allows for admission to the HBO. The HBO (higher professional education) are [[Vocational university|universities of professional education]] (applied sciences) that award professional bachelor's degrees; similar to polytechnic degrees. A HBO degree gives access to the university system. The [[Voorbereidend wetenschappelijk onderwijs|VWO]] (comprising [[Atheneum (school)|atheneum]] and [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]]) has 6 grades and prepares for studying at a research university. Universities offer of a three-year bachelor's degree, followed by a one or two year master's degree, which in turn can be followed by a four or five-year [[doctoral degree]] program.\n\nDoctoral candidates in the Netherlands are generally non-tenured employees of a university. All Dutch schools and universities are publicly funded and managed with the exception of religious schools that are publicly funded but not managed by the state even though requirements are necessary for the funding to be authorised. Dutch universities have a tuition fee of about 2,000 euros a year for students from the Netherlands and the European Union. The amount is about 10,000 euros for non-EU students.\n\n===Healthcare===\n{{Main|Healthcare in the Netherlands}}\n[[File:Anthonie van Leeuwenhoek (1632-1723).

On 48 indicators such as patient rights and information, accessibility, prevention and outcomes, the Netherlands secured its top position among 37 European countries for six years in a row.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.healthpowerhouse.com|title=Health Consumer Powerhouse|work=healthpowerhouse.com|accessdate=26 August 2016}}</ref>\nThe Netherlands was ranked first in a study in 2009 comparing the [[health care system]]s of the United States, Australia, Canada, Germany and New Zealand.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE65M0SU20100623 | work=Reuters | title=U.S. scores dead last again in healthcare study | date=23 June 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/26/6/w717.full.pdf+html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120110040524/http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/26/6/w717.full.pdf+html|url-status=dead|archive-date=10 January 2012|title=Toward Higher-Performance Health Systems: Adults' Health Care Experiences In Seven Countries, 2007}}</ref>\n\nEver since a major reform of the health care system in 2006, the Dutch system received more points in the Index each year. According to the HCP ([[Health Consumer Powerhouse]]), the Netherlands has 'a chaos system', meaning patients have a great degree of freedom from where to buy their health insurance, to where they get their healthcare service. The difference between the Netherlands and other countries is that the chaos is managed. Healthcare decisions are being made in a dialogue between the patients and healthcare professionals.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://healthpowerhouse.com/|title=Health Consumer Powerhouse \u2013 Health Care System's Indexes and reports}}</ref>\n\nHealth insurance in the Netherlands is mandatory. Healthcare in the Netherlands is covered by two statutory forms of insurance:\n* Zorgverzekeringswet (ZVW), often called \"basic insurance\", covers common medical care.\n* Algemene Wet Bijzondere Ziektekosten (AWBZ) covers long-term nursing and care.\n\nWhile Dutch residents are automatically insured by the government for AWBZ, everyone has to take out their own basic healthcare insurance (basisverzekering), except those under 18 who are automatically covered under their parents' premium. If a person decides not to carry out an insurance coverage, the person may be fined. Insurers have to offer a universal package for everyone over the age of 18 years, regardless of age or state of health \u2013 it's illegal to refuse an application or impose special conditions. In contrast to many other European systems, the Dutch government is responsible for the accessibility and quality of the healthcare system in the Netherlands, but not in charge of its management.\n\nHealthcare in the Netherlands can be divided in several ways: three echelons, in somatic and mental health care and in 'cure' (short term) and 'care' (long term). Home doctors (''huisartsen'', comparable to [[general practitioner]]s) form the largest part of the first echelon. Being referenced by a member of the first echelon is mandatory for access to the second and third echelon.<ref name=\"Boot\">J.M.

Long-term treatments, especially those that involve semi-permanent hospitalisation, and also disability costs such as wheelchairs, are covered by a state-controlled mandatory insurance. This is laid down in the ''[[AWBZ|Algemene Wet Bijzondere Ziektekosten]]'' (\"General Law on Exceptional Healthcare Costs\") which first came into effect in 1968. In 2009 this insurance covered 27% of all health care expenses.<ref name=\"statline.cbs.nl\">{{cite web|url=http://statline.cbs.nl/StatWeb/publication/?DM=SLNL&PA=71914ned&D1=37-43&D2=a&HDR=G1&STB=T&VW=T|title=Zorgrekeningen; uitgaven (in lopende en constante prijzen) en financiering|date=20 May 2010|publisher=Centraal Bureau voor de Statistiek: StatLine|language=Dutch|accessdate=16 May 2011}}</ref>\n\nFor all regular (short-term) medical treatment, there is a system of obligatory [[health insurance]], with private health insurance companies.

Risk variances between private health insurance companies due to the different risks presented by individual policy holders are compensated through [[Risk equalization|risk equalisation]] and a common [[risk pool]]. The funding burden for all short-term health care coverage is carried 50% by employers, 45% by the insured person and 5% by the government. Children under 18 are covered for free. Those on low incomes receive compensation to help them pay their insurance. Premiums paid by the insured are about \u20ac100 per month (about US$127 in August 2010 and \u20ac150 or US$196 in 2012), with variation of about 5% between the various competing insurers, and a yearly deductible of \u20ac220 (US$288).\n\n==Culture==\n{{Main|Culture of the Netherlands}}\n[[File:Hollande04.jpg|thumb|600px|center|<div style=\"text-align:center;\">Some symbols and icons of Dutch culture</div>]]\n\n===Art, philosophy and literature===\n{{Main|Dutch art|Architecture of the Netherlands|Dutch literature}}\n{{multiple image|perrow=2/1/1|total_width=300|caption_align=center\n| image1 = Meisje met de parel.jpg|caption1=''[[Girl with a Pearl Earring]]'' by [[Johannes Vermeer]]\n| image2 = Vincent van Gogh - Self-portrait with grey felt hat - Google Art Project.jpg|caption2=Self-portrait by [[Vincent van Gogh]]\n| image3 = Rijksmuseum 2022.jpg|caption3=The [[Rijksmuseum]]\n| image4 = NEMO and area.jpg|caption4=The National [[NEMO (museum)|NEMO Science Museum]] and the [[Nederlands Scheepvaartmuseum]] in second plan, in Amsterdam\n}}\n\nThe Netherlands has had many well-known painters.

The Dutch scientist [[Christiaan Huygens]] (1629\u20131695) discovered [[Saturn]]'s moon [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], argued that light travelled as waves, invented the [[pendulum clock]] and was the first physicist to use mathematical formulae. [[Antonie van Leeuwenhoek]] was the first to observe and describe [[Microorganism|single-celled organisms]] with a [[microscope]].\n\nIn the [[Dutch Golden Age]], literature flourished as well, with [[Joost van den Vondel]] and [[Pieter Corneliszoon Hooft|P. C. Hooft]] as the two most famous writers. In the 19th century, [[Multatuli]] wrote about the poor treatment of the natives in the Dutch colony, the current Indonesia. Important 20th century authors include [[Godfried Bomans]], [[Harry Mulisch]], [[Jan Wolkers]], [[Simon Vestdijk]], [[Hella S. Haasse]], [[Cees Nooteboom]], [[Gerard Reve]] and [[Willem Frederik Hermans]]. [[Anne Frank]]'s [[The Diary of a Young Girl|''Diary of a Young Girl'']] was published after she was murdered in the Holocaust and translated from Dutch to all major languages.\n\nThe traditional Dutch architecture is especially valued in [[Amsterdam]], [[Delft]] and [[Leiden]], with 17 and 18th century buildings along the canals. Smaller village architecture with wooden houses is found in [[Zaandam]] and [[Marken]]. Replicas of Dutch buildings can be found in [[Huis Ten Bosch (theme park)|Huis Ten Bosch]], [[Nagasaki]], [[Japan]]. A similar Holland Village is being built in [[Shenyang]], [[China]].

Traditional Dutch music is a genre known as \"[[Levenslied]]\", meaning ''Song of life'', to an extent comparable to a French [[Chanson]] or a German [[Schlager music|Schlager]]. These songs typically have a simple melody and rhythm, and a straightforward structure of couplets and choruses. Themes can be light, but are often sentimental and include [[love]], [[death]] and [[loneliness]]. Traditional musical instruments such as the [[accordion]] and the [[barrel organ]] are a staple of levenslied music, though in recent years many artists also use synthesisers and guitars. Artists in this genre include [[Jan Smit (singer)|Jan Smit]], [[Frans Bauer]] and [[Andr\u00e9 Hazes]].\n\n[[File:Anouk, ESC2013 press conference 09 (crop).jpg|thumb|upright=0.85|Pop singer [[Anouk (singer)|Anouk]] in 2013]]\n[[File:Coldplay perform \"Up&Up\", Amsterdam Arena, June 2016 (5).jpg|thumb|upright=0.85|[[Johan Cruyff Arena]], the largest Dutch concert venue]]\nContemporary Dutch [[Rock music|rock]] and [[pop music]] ([[Nederpop]]) originated in the 1960s, heavily influenced by popular music from the [[United States]] and [[United Kingdom|Britain]]. In the 1960s and 1970s the lyrics were mostly in English, and some tracks were instrumental. Bands such as [[Shocking Blue]], [[Golden Earring]], [[Tee Set]], [[George Baker Selection]] and [[Focus (band)|Focus]] enjoyed international success. As of the 1980s, more and more pop musicians started working in the Dutch language, partly inspired by the huge success of the band [[Doe Maar]]. Today Dutch rock and pop music thrives in both languages, with some artists recording in both.\n\nCurrent [[symphonic metal]] bands [[Epica (band)|Epica]], [[Delain]], [[ReVamp]], [[The Gathering (band)|The Gathering]], [[Asrai]], [[Autumn]], [[Ayreon]] and [[Within Temptation]] as well as [[jazz]] and pop singer [[Caro Emerald]] are having international success. Also, metal bands like [[Hail of Bullets]], [[God Dethroned]], [[Izegrim]], [[Asphyx]], [[Textures (band)|Textures]], [[Present Danger]], [[Heidevolk]] and [[Slechtvalk]] are popular guests at the biggest [[metal festival]]s in Europe.

In the mid 1990s Dutch language [[Hip hop music|rap and hip hop]] (''[[Dutch hip hop|Nederhop]]'') also came to fruition and has become popular in the Netherlands and Belgium. Artists with North African, Caribbean or Middle Eastern origins have strongly influenced this genre.\n\nSince the 1990s, Dutch [[electronic dance music]] (EDM) gained widespread popularity in the world in many forms, from [[trance music|trance]], [[techno]] and [[gabber]] to [[hardstyle]].

Federations for sports were established (such as the speed skating federation in 1882), rules were unified and sports clubs came into existence. A [[NOC*NSF|Dutch National Olympic Committee]] was established in 1912. Thus far, the nation has won 266 medals at the [[Summer Olympic Games]] and another 110 medals at the [[Winter Olympic Games]]. In international competition, Dutch national teams and athletes are dominant in several fields of sport. The [[Netherlands women's national field hockey team|Netherlands women's field hockey team]] is the most successful team in [[Women's Hockey World Cup|World Cup]] history. The [[Netherlands national baseball team|Netherlands baseball team]] have won the [[European Baseball Championship|European championship]] 20 times out of 32 events. Dutch [[K-1]] [[Kickboxing|kickboxers]] have won the [[K-1 World Grand Prix]] 15 times out of 19 tournaments.\n\nThe Dutch [[Speed skating|speed skaters']] performance at the [[2014 Winter Olympics]], where they won 8 out of 12 events, 23 out of 36 medals, including 4 clean sweeps, is the most dominant performance in a single sport in Olympic history. Motorcycle racing at the [[TT Circuit Assen]] has a long history. Assen is the only venue to have held a round of the Motorcycle World Championship every year since its creation in 1949. The circuit was purpose-built for the Dutch TT in 1954, with previous events having been held on public roads.\n\nThe Dutch have also had success in all three of cyclings Grand Tours with [[Jan Janssen]] winning the [[1968 Tour de France]], more recently with [[Tom Dumoulin]] winning the [[2017 Giro d'Italia]] and legendary rider [[Joop Zoetemelk]] was the 1985 UCI World Champion, the winner of the [[1979 Vuelta a Espana]], the [[1980 Tour de France]] and still holds or shares numerous [[Tour de France]] records including most Tours finished and most kilometers ridden.\n\nLimburger [[Max Verstappen]] currently races in [[Formula One]], and [[2016 Spanish Grand Prix|was the first Dutchman to win a Grand Prix]].

Dutch cuisine is simple and straightforward, and contains many dairy products. Breakfast and lunch are typically bread with toppings, with cereal for breakfast as an alternative. Traditionally, dinner consists of potatoes, a portion of meat, and (seasonal) vegetables. The Dutch diet was relatively high in carbohydrates and fat, reflecting the dietary needs of the labourers whose culture moulded the country. Without many refinements, it is best described as rustic, though many holidays are still celebrated with special foods. In the course of the twentieth century this diet changed and became much more [[Multiculturalism|cosmopolitan]], with most [[global cuisine]]s being represented in the major cities.\n\nModern culinary writers distinguish between three general regional forms of Dutch cuisine. The regions in the northeast of the Netherlands, roughly the provinces of [[Groningen (province)|Groningen]], [[Friesland]], [[Drenthe]], [[Overijssel]] and [[Gelderland]] north of the [[Grote rivieren|great rivers]] are the least populated areas of the Netherlands. The late (18th century) introduction of large scale agriculture means that the cuisine is generally known for its many kinds of meats. The relative lack of farms allowed for an abundance of [[game (meat)|game]] and [[Animal husbandry|husbandry]], though dishes near the coastal regions of Friesland, Groningen and the parts of Overijssel bordering the [[IJsselmeer]] also include a large amount of fish. The various dried sausages, belonging to the [[metworst]]-family of Dutch sausages are found throughout this region and are highly prized for their often very strong taste. Also smoked sausages are common, of which (''Gelderse'') ''[[rookworst]]'' is the most renowned. The sausage contains a lot of fat and is very juicy. Larger sausages are often eaten alongside ''[[stamppot]]'', ''[[hutspot]]'' or ''zuurkool'' ([[sauerkraut]]); whereas smaller ones are often eaten as a [[street food]]. The provinces are also home to hard textured [[rye bread]], pastries and cookies, the latter heavily spiced with [[ginger]] or [[succade]] or contain small bits of meat. Various kinds of ''Kruidkoek'' (such as [[:nl:Groninger koek|Groninger koek]]), ''[[:nl:Fryske d\u00famkes|Fryske d\u00famkes]]'' and ''[[:nl:spekdik|spekdikken]]'' (small savory pancakes cooked in a waffle iron) are considered typical. Notable characteristics of ''Fries roggebrood'' (Frisian rye bread) is its long baking time (up to 20 hours), resulting in a sweet taste and a deep dark colour.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.warenkennis.nl/graan/soorten.htm|title=Graansoorten|website=Warenkennis.nl|accessdate=3 August 2017}}</ref> In terms of alcoholic beverages, the region is renowned for its many [[bitters]] (such as ''[[Beerenburg]]'') and other high-proof liquors rather than beer, which is, apart from ''[[Jenever]]'', typical for the rest of the country. As a coastal region, Friesland is home to low-lying grasslands, and thus has a cheese production in common with the Western cuisine. ''Friese Nagelkaas'' ([[Friesian Clove]]) is a notable example.\n\nThe provinces of [[North Holland]], [[South Holland]], [[Zeeland]], and [[Utrecht (province)|Utrecht]] and the Gelderlandic area of [[Betuwe]] make up the region in which western Dutch cuisine is found. Because of the abundance of water and flat grasslands that are found here, the area is known for its many dairy products, which include prominent cheeses such as [[Gouda (cheese)|Gouda]], [[Leyden cheese|Leyden]] (spiced cheese with cumin), and [[Edam (cheese)|Edam]] (traditionally in small spheres) as well as [[Leerdammer]] and [[Beemster Cheese|Beemster]], while the adjacent [[Zaanstreek]] in [[North Holland]] has since the 16th century beem known for its [[mayonnaise]], typical whole-grain [[mustard (condiment)|mustards]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smulweb.nl/blog/tonia/718/de-geschiedenis-van-de-mosterd|title=De geschiedenis van de mosterd - Smulweb Blog|date=5 May 2000}}</ref> and [[chocolate]] industry. Zeeland and South Holland produce a lot of butter, which contains a larger amount of [[milkfat]] than most other European butter varieties. A by-product of the butter-making process, ''karnemelk'' ([[buttermilk]]), is also considered typical for this region. [[Seafood]] such as [[soused herring]], [[Blue mussel|mussels]] (called ''Zeeuwse Mossels'', since all Dutch mussels for consumption are cleaned in Zeeland's [[Oosterschelde]]), [[European eel|eels]], [[oyster]]s and [[shrimp]]s are widely available and typical for the region. ''[[:nl:Kibbeling|Kibbeling]]'', once a local delicacy consisting of small chunks of battered [[Whitefish (fisheries term)|white fish]], has become a national [[fast food]], just as [[:nl:Lekkerbekje|lekkerbek]]. Pastries in this area tend to be quite doughy, and often contain large amounts of sugar; either caramelised, powdered or crystallised. The ''[[oliebol]]'' (in its modern form) and ''[[Zeeuwse bolus]]'' are good examples. Cookies are also produced in great number and tend to contain a lot of butter and sugar, like ''[[stroopwafel]]'', as well as a filling of some kind, mostly almond, like ''[[:nl:Gevulde koek|gevulde koek]]''. The traditional alcoholic beverages of this region are [[beer]] (strong pale lager) and ''[[Jenever]]'', a high proof [[juniper]]-flavored spirit, that came to be known in England as [[gin]]. A noted exception within the traditional Dutch alcoholic landscape, ''[[Advocaat]]'', a rich and creamy liqueur made from eggs, sugar and brandy, is also native to this region.\n\nThe Southern Dutch cuisine consists of the cuisines of the Dutch provinces of [[North Brabant]] and [[Limburg (Netherlands)|Limburg]] and the [[Flemish Region]] in [[Belgium]]. It is renowned for its many rich pastries, soups, stews and vegetable dishes and is often called Burgundian which is a Dutch idiom invoking the rich Burgundian court which ruled the Low Countries in the Middle Ages, renowned for its splendor and great feasts. It is the only Dutch culinary region that developed an [[haute cuisine]]. Pastries are abundant, often with rich fillings of cream, custard or fruits. Cakes, such as the ''[[Vlaai]]'' from Limburg and the ''Moorkop'' and ''[[Bossche Bol]]'' from Brabant, are typical pastries. Savoury pastries also occur, with the {{lang|nl|worstenbroodje}} (a roll with a sausage of [[ground beef]], literally translates into sausage bread) being the most popular. The traditional alcoholic beverage of the region is beer. There are many local brands, ranging from ''[[Trappist beer|Trappist]]'' to ''[[Kriek lambic|Kriek]]''. 5 of the 10 ''International Trappist Association'' recognised breweries in the world, are located in the Southern Dutch cultural area. Beer, like wine in French cuisine, is also used in cooking; often in stews.\n\nIn early 2014, [[Oxfam]] ranked the Netherlands as the country with the most nutritious, plentiful and healthy food, in a comparison of 125 countries.<ref>{{cite news |last=Reaney |first=Patricia |date=14 January 2014 |title=Netherlands is country with most plentiful, healthy food: Oxfam |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/01/15/us-food-countries-idUSBREA0E01S20140115 |newspaper= |location=New York |publisher=Reuters U.S. |accessdate=1 September 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite press release |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Good Enough to Eat \u2013 Media Briefing|url=http://www.oxfamamerica.org/static/media/files/Good_Enough_To_Eat_Media_brief_FINAL.pdf |location=Boston, MA |publisher=[[Oxfam]] America |agency= |date=14 January 2013 |accessdate=1 September 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Colonial heritage===\n{{Main|Dutch Empire}}\n{{further|Dutch East Indies|Indos in the Dutch East Indies}}\n[[File:GezichtOpNieuwAmsterdam.jpg|200px|thumb|left|[[New Amsterdam]] as it appeared in 1664.

There is diversity even within languages. In English, the Netherlands is also called [[Holland]] or (part of) [[the Low Countries]], whereas the term ''\"[[Dutch language|Dutch]]\"'' is used as the [[demonym]] and adjectival form. \n\n===The Netherlands and the Low Countries===\nThe region called the [[Low Countries]] (comprising [[Belgium]], the Netherlands and [[Luxembourg]]) and the Country of the Netherlands, have the same [[toponymy]]. Place names with ''Neder'' (or ''lage''), ''Nieder'', ''Nether'' (or ''low'') and ''Nedre'' (in [[Germanic languages]]) and ''Bas'' or ''Inferior'' (in [[Romance languages]]) are in use in places all over Europe. They are sometimes used in a [[deictic]] relation to a higher ground that consecutively is indicated as ''Upper'', ''Boven'', ''Oben'', ''Superior'' or ''Haut''. In the case of the Low Countries / Netherlands the geographical location of the ''lower'' region has been more or less downstream and near the sea. The geographical location of the upper region, however, changed tremendously over time, depending on the location of the economic and military power governing the Low Countries area. The [[Roman Empire|Romans]] made a distinction between the Roman provinces of downstream [[Germania Inferior]] (nowadays part of Belgium and the Netherlands) and upstream [[Germania Superior]] (nowadays part of Germany). The designation 'Low' to refer to the region returns again in the 10th century Duchy of [[Lower Lorraine]], that covered much of the Low Countries.<ref name=\"Franks (Columbia Encyclopedia)\">{{cite web |url = http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Franks.aspx |title=Franks |publisher=[[Columbia University Press]] |encyclopedia=[[Columbia Encyclopedia]] |year=2013 |accessdate=1 February 2014 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url = http://nobhist.narod.ru/lorraine.html |title=Lotharingia / Lorraine (Lothringen) |date=5 September 2013 |accessdate=1 February 2014 }}</ref> But this time the corresponding ''Upper'' region is [[Upper Lorraine]], in nowadays Northern France.\n\nThe [[Dukes of Burgundy]], who ruled the Low Countries in the 15th century, used the term ''les pays de par de\u00e7\u00e0'' (\"the lands over here\") for the Low Countries as opposed to ''les pays de par del\u00e0'' (\"the lands over there\") for their original homeland: [[Burgundy]] in present-day east-central France.<ref name=\"BlockmansPrevenier2010\">{{cite book |author1=Wim Blockmans |author2=Walter Prevenier |title = The Promised Lands: The Low Countries Under Burgundian Rule, 1369-1530 |url = https://books.google.com/?id=0Foy9GGgdcgC&pg=PA85&dq=duke+pays+de+par+de\u00e7\u00e0#v=onepage&q=duke%20pays%20de%20par%20de\u00e7\u00e0&f=false |date=3 August 2010 |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |isbn=978-0-8122-0070-6 |pages=85\u2013 }}</ref> Under [[Habsburg Netherlands|Habsburg rule]], ''Les pays de par de\u00e7\u00e0'' developed in ''pays d'embas'' (\"lands down-here\"),<ref>{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/?id=59Pae06JSiUC&lpg=PP1&dq=The%20New%20Cambridge%20Modern%20History%3A%20Volume%202%2C%20The%20Reformation%2C%201520-1559&pg=PA342#v=onepage&q=The%20New%20Cambridge%20Modern%20History:%20Volume%202,%20The%20Reformation,%201520-1559&f=false |title = The New Cambridge Modern History: Volume 2, The Reformation, 1520\u20131559 |isbn = 9780521345361 |last1 = Elton |first1 = Geoffrey Rudolph |year = 1990 }}</ref> a deictic expression in relation to other Habsburg possessions like Hungary and Austria.

The area known as ''Oberland'' (High country) was in this deictic context considered to begin approximately at the nearby higher located [[Cologne]].\n\nFrom the mid-sixteenth century on, the \"Low Countries\" and the \"Netherlands\" lost their original deictic meaning. They were probably the most commonly used names, besides [[Flanders]], a ''[[pars pro toto]]'' for the Low Countries, especially in Romance language speaking Europe. The [[Eighty Years' War]] (1568\u20131648) divided the Low Countries into an independent northern [[Dutch Republic]] (or [[Latinisation of names|Latinised]] ''Belgica Foederata'', \"Federated Netherlands\", the precursor state of the Netherlands) and a Spanish controlled [[Southern Netherlands]] (Latinised ''Belgica Regia'', \"Royal Netherlands\", the precursor state of Belgium). The Low Countries today is a designation that includes the countries of the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg, although in most [[Romance languages]], the term \"Low Countries\" is used as the name for the Netherlands specifically. It is used synonymous with the more neutral and geopolitical term [[Benelux]].\n\n===Holland===\nThe Netherlands is also referred to as [[Holland]] in various languages, including English. The region of Holland proper consists of [[North Holland|North]] and [[South Holland]], two of the nation's twelve provinces, formerly a single province, and earlier still, the [[County of Holland]], a remnant of the dissolved [[Frisian Kingdom]]. Following the decline of the [[Duchy of Brabant]] and the [[County of Flanders]], Holland became the most economically and politically important county in the [[Low Countries]] region. The emphasis on Holland during the formation of the [[Dutch Republic]], the [[Eighty Years' War]], and the [[Anglo-Dutch Wars]] in the 16th, 17th, and 18th century, made Holland serve as a ''[[pars pro toto]]'' for the entire country, which is now considered informal<ref>{{cite news |url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/topics/about-us/style-book/1435302/Telegraph-style-book-places-and-peoples.html |title=Telegraph style book: places and peoples |accessdate=31 March 2014 |location=London |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=12 April 2008 }}</ref> or incorrect.<ref>{{cite news |url = http://handbook.reuters.com/index.php?title=H#Holland |title=The Reuters Style Guide |accessdate=31 March 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.media.uoa.gr/lectures/linguistic_archives/academic_papers0506/notes/stylesheets_3.pdf|title=The BBC News Styleguide|accessdate=31 March 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120227003642/http://www2.media.uoa.gr/lectures/linguistic_archives/academic_papers0506/notes/stylesheets_3.pdf|archive-date=27 February 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> The use of the term Holland when referring to the whole of the Netherlands is disliked by many Dutch people.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}} Nonetheless, the name \"Holland\" is still widely used for the [[Netherlands national football team]], including in the Netherlands,<ref>{{cite news |url = http://image.guardian.co.uk/sys-files/Guardian/documents/2004/07/15/styleguidepdfjuly2004.pdf |title=The Guardian style guide |accessdate=31 March 2014 |location=London }}</ref> and the Dutch government's international websites for tourism and trade are \"holland.com\" and \"hollandtradeandinvest.com\".<ref>[http://www.netherlands-tourism.com/netherlands-holland/ ''Netherlands Tourism''] \"Holland vs Netherlands \u2013 Is the Netherlands the same as Holland?\"</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://exploreholland.nl/holland-vs-netherlands/|title=Holland vs Netherlands: Everything you need to know|date=2020-01-17|website=Explore Holland|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-17}}</ref> In 2020, however, the Dutch government has announced that it will only communicate and advertise under the name \"the Netherlands\" in the future.<ref>{{cite news |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/13/world/europe/holland-netherlands-new-name.html |title=Why Dutch Officials Want You to Forget the Country of Holland|date=13 January 2020|website=The New York Times|accessdate=15 January 2020|location=New York City }}</ref>\n\n===Dutch===\nThe term Dutch is used as the demonymic and adjectival form of the Netherlands in the English language. The origins of the word go back to Proto-Germanic ''*\u00feiudiskaz'', meaning \"popular\" or \"of the people\"; akin to Old Dutch ''dietsc'', Old High German ''diutsch'', and Old English ''\u00feeodisc'', all meaning \"(of) the common (Germanic) people\". At first, the English language used (the contemporary form of) Dutch to refer to any or all speakers of West Germanic languages (e.g. the Dutch, the Frisians, and the Germans). Gradually its meaning shifted to the West Germanic people they had most contact with, because of their geographical proximity and for the rivalry in trade and overseas territories.

Most of present-day Netherlands became part of [[Middle Francia]], which was a weak kingdom and subject of numerous partitions and annexation attempts by its stronger neighbours. It comprised territories from [[Frisia]] in the north to the [[Kingdom of Italy (medieval)|Kingdom of Italy]] in the south. Around 850, [[Lothair I]] of Middle Francia acknowledged the Viking [[Rorik of Dorestad]] as ruler of most of Frisia.<ref>Baldwin, Stewart, [http://archiver.rootsweb.ancestry.com/th/read/GEN-MEDIEVAL/2002-09/1031544685 \"Danish Haralds in 9th Century Frisia\"]. Retrieved 9 October 2011.</ref> When the kingdom of Middle Francia was partitioned in 855, the lands north of the [[Alps]] passed to [[Lothair II of Lotharingia|Lothair II]] and subsequently were named [[Lotharingia]]. After he died in 869, Lotharingia was partitioned, into [[Upper Lotharingia|Upper]] and [[Lower Lotharingia]], the latter part comprising the Low Countries that technically became part of [[East Francia]] in 870, although it was effectively under the control of Vikings, who raided the largely defenceless [[Frisians|Frisian]] and [[Franks|Frankish]] towns lying on the Frisian coast and along the rivers. Around 879, another Viking raided the Frisian lands, [[Godfrid, Duke of Frisia]]. The Viking raids made the sway of French and German lords in the area weak. Resistance to the Vikings, if any, came from local nobles, who gained in stature as a result, and that laid the basis for the disintegration of Lower Lotharingia into semi-independent states. One of these local nobles was [[Gerolf of Holland]], who assumed lordship in Frisia after he helped to assassinate Godfrid, and Viking rule came to an end.\n\n===High Middle Ages (1000\u20131384)===\n{{Main|History of urban centers in the Low Countries}}\nThe [[Holy Roman Empire]] (the successor state of East Francia and then Lotharingia) ruled much of the Low Countries in the 10th and 11th century, but was not able to maintain political unity. Powerful local nobles turned their cities, counties and duchies into private kingdoms that felt little sense of obligation to the emperor. [[County of Holland|Holland]], [[County of Hainaut|Hainaut]], [[County of Flanders|Flanders]], [[Duchy of Gelre|Gelre]], [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]], and [[Bishopric of Utrecht|Utrecht]] were in a state of almost continual war or in paradoxically formed personal unions. The language and culture of most of the people who lived in the County of Holland were originally [[Frisia]]n. As Frankish settlement progressed from Flanders and Brabant, the area quickly became [[Old Low Franconian]] (or [[Old Dutch]]). The rest of [[Frisia]] in the north (now [[Friesland]] and [[Groningen (province)|Groningen]]) continued to maintain its independence and had its own institutions (collectively called the \"[[Frisian freedom]]\"), which resented the imposition of the feudal system.\n\nAround 1000 AD, due to several agricultural developments, the economy started to develop at a fast pace, and the higher productivity allowed workers to farm more land or to become tradesmen. Towns grew around [[monasteries]] and [[castles]], and a mercantile middle class began to develop in these urban areas, especially in Flanders and later also Brabant. Wealthy cities started to buy certain [[City rights in the Low Countries|privileges]] for themselves from the [[monarch|sovereign]]. In practice, this meant that [[Brugge]] and [[Antwerp]] became quasi-independent republics in their own right and would later develop into some of the most important cities and ports in Europe.\n\nAround 1100 AD, farmers from [[County of Flanders|Flanders]] and [[Bishopric of Utrecht|Utrecht]] began draining and cultivating uninhabited swampy land in the western Netherlands, making the emergence of the County of Holland as the centre of power possible. The title of [[Count of Holland]] was fought over in the [[Hook and Cod Wars]] ({{lang-nl|Hoekse en Kabeljauwse twisten}}) between 1350 and 1490. The Cod faction consisted of the more progressive cities, while the Hook faction consisted of the conservative noblemen. These noblemen invited the Duke [[Philip the Good]] of Burgundy \u2014 who was also Count of Flanders \u2014 to conquer Holland.\n\n===Burgundian, Habsburg and Spanish Habsburg Netherlands (1384\u20131581)===\n{{Main|Burgundian Netherlands|Habsburg Netherlands|Spanish Netherlands}}\n{{multiple image|perrow=1/2/1|align=left|total_width=250|caption_align=center\n| title = Spanish Netherlands\n| image1 = Van Soest, Four Days Battle.jpg|caption1=''The [[Four Days' Battle]], 1\u20134 June 1666'' ([[Second Anglo\u2013Dutch War]]) by [[Pieter Cornelisz van Soest]]\n| image2 = Political map of the Low Countries (1350)-NL.svg|caption2=The Low Countries in the late 14th century\n| image3 = William I, Prince of Orange by Adriaen Thomasz.

The [[House of Valois-Burgundy]] and their [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]] heirs would rule the Low Countries in the period from 1384 to 1581. Before the Burgundian union, the Dutch identified themselves by the town they lived in or their local duchy or county. The Burgundian period is when the road to nationhood began. The new rulers defended Dutch trading interests, which then developed rapidly. The fleets of the [[County of Holland]] defeated the fleets of the [[Hanseatic League]] several times. [[Amsterdam]] grew and in the 15th century became the primary trading port in Europe for grain from the [[Baltic region]]. Amsterdam distributed grain to the major cities of Belgium, Northern France and England. This trade was vital, because Holland could no longer produce enough grain to feed itself. Land drainage had caused the [[peat]] of the former [[wetland]]s to reduce to a level that was too low for drainage to be maintained.\n\nUnder Habsburg [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], ruler of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] and King of [[Habsburg Spain|Spain]], all fiefs in the current Netherlands region were united into the [[Seventeen Provinces]], which also included most of present-day Belgium, Luxembourg, and some adjacent land in what is now France and Germany. In 1568, the [[Eighty Years' War]] between the Provinces and their [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] ruler began. The level of ferocity exhibited by both sides can be gleaned from a Dutch chronicler's report:<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/risedutchrepubl01motlgoog|quote=On more than one occasion men were seen hanging their own brothers, who had been taken prisoners in the enemy's ranks....

Most of the areas below sea level are man-made, caused by [[peat]] extraction or achieved through [[land reclamation]]. Since the late 16th century, large [[polder]] areas are preserved through elaborate drainage systems that include [[dike (construction)|dikes]], canals and pumping stations. Nearly 17% of the country's land area is reclaimed from the sea and from lakes.\n\nMuch of the country was originally formed by the [[estuary|estuaries]] of three large European rivers: the [[Rhine]] (''Rijn''), the [[Meuse River|Meuse]] (''Maas'') and the [[Scheldt]] (''Schelde''), as well as their [[tributary|tributaries]].

In the past these rivers functioned as a natural barrier between [[fief]]doms and hence historically created a cultural divide, as is evident in some phonetic traits that are recognisable on either side of what the Dutch call their \"Great Rivers\" (''de Grote Rivieren''). Another significant branch of the Rhine, the [[IJssel]] river, discharges into [[IJsselmeer|Lake IJssel]], the former [[Zuiderzee]] ('southern sea'). Just like the previous, this river forms a linguistic divide: people to the northeast of this river speak [[Dutch Low Saxon]] dialects (except for the province of [[Friesland]], which has its own language).<ref name=\"international2000\">Welschen, Ad: Course ''Dutch Society and Culture'', International School for Humanities and Social Studies ISHSS, Universiteit van Amsterdam, 2000\u20132005.</ref>\n\n===Floods===\n{{Main|Flood control in the Netherlands|Floods in the Netherlands|North Sea flood of 1953|Storm tides of the North Sea}}\n[[File:Christmas flood 1717.jpg|thumb|The [[Christmas flood of 1717]] was the result of a northwesterly storm that resulted in the death of thousands.]]\n\nOver the centuries, the Dutch coastline has changed considerably as a result of natural disasters and human intervention.\n\nOn 14 December 1287, [[St. Lucia's flood]] affected the Netherlands and Germany, killing more than 50,000 people in one of the most destructive floods in recorded history.<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1485002/Zuiderzee-floods Zuiderzee floods (Netherlands history)].

The huge [[North Sea flood of 1953|North Sea flood of early February 1953]] caused the collapse of several dikes in the south-west of the Netherlands; more than 1,800 people drowned in the flood. The Dutch government subsequently instituted a large-scale programme, the \"[[Deltawerken|Delta Works]]\", to protect the country against future flooding, which was completed over a period of more than thirty years.\n\n[[File:The Netherlands compared to sealevel.png|thumb|left|Map illustrating areas of the Netherlands below sea level]]\nThe impact of disasters was, to an extent, increased through human activity. Relatively high-lying [[swamp]]land was drained to be used as farmland. The drainage caused the fertile [[peat]] to contract and ground levels to drop, upon which groundwater levels were lowered to compensate for the drop in ground level, causing the underlying peat to contract further. Additionally, until the 19th century peat was mined, dried, and used for fuel, further exacerbating the problem. Centuries of extensive and poorly controlled [[peat]] extraction lowered an already low land surface by several metres. Even in flooded areas, peat extraction continued through turf dredging.\n\nBecause of the flooding, farming was difficult, which encouraged foreign trade, the result of which was that the Dutch were involved in world affairs since the early 14th/15th century.<ref>Duplessis, Robert S.

In the first millennium [[AD]], villages and farmhouses were built on man-made hills called ''terps''. Later, these terps were connected by dikes. In the 12th century, local government agencies called ''\"[[Water board (Netherlands)|waterschappen]]\"'' (\"water boards\") or ''\"[[Water board (Netherlands)|hoogheemraadschappen]]\"'' (\"high home councils\") started to appear, whose job it was to maintain the water level and to protect a region from floods; these agencies continue to exist. As the ground level dropped, the dikes by necessity grew and merged into an integrated system. By the 13th century [[windmill]]s had come into use to pump water out of areas below sea level. The windmills were later used to drain lakes, creating the famous [[polder]]s.<ref>{{cite web|title=Windmills in Dutch History|url=http://www.let.rug.nl/polders/boekje/history.htm|website=Let.rug.nl|publisher=Rijks Universiteit Groningen|accessdate=7 July 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170705084250/http://www.let.rug.nl/polders/boekje/history.htm|archive-date=5 July 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn 1932 the ''[[Afsluitdijk]]'' (\"Closure Dike\") was completed, blocking the former ''[[Zuiderzee]]'' (Southern Sea) from the North Sea and thus creating the [[IJsselmeer]] ([[IJssel]] Lake).

The project started in 1958 and was largely completed in 1997 with the completion of the [[Maeslantkering]]. Since then, new projects have been periodically started to renovate and renew the Delta Works. A main goal of the Delta project was to reduce the risk of flooding in South Holland and Zeeland to once per 10,000 years (compared to 1 per 4000 years for the rest of the country). This was achieved by raising {{convert|3000|km|mi|0}} of outer sea-dikes and {{convert|10000|km|mi|0}} of inner, canal, and river dikes, and by closing off the sea [[estuary|estuaries]] of the Zeeland province.

If one chooses the height of measurement to be {{convert|10|cm|0|abbr=on}} above ground instead of {{convert|150|cm|0|abbr=on}}, one may even find such temperatures in the middle of the summer. On average, snow can occur from November to April, but sometimes occurs in May or October too.\n\nWarm days\u2014maximum temperature above {{convert|20|C|F|0}}\u2014are usually found in April to October, but in some parts of the country these warm days can also occur in March, or even sometimes in November or February (usually not in {{Not a typo|De Bilt}}, however).

Summer and autumn months tend to gather a little more precipitation than the other months, mainly because of the intensity of the rainfall rather than the frequency of rain days (this is especially the case in summer, when lightning is also much more frequent).\n\nThe number of sunshine hours is affected by the fact that because of the geographical latitude, the length of the days varies between barely eight hours in December and nearly 17 hours in June.\n\nThe following tables are based on mean measurements by the [[KNMI (institute)|KNMI]] weather station in [[De Bilt]] between 1981 and 2010.

The Netherlands is described as a [[consociational state]]. Dutch politics and governance are characterised by an effort to achieve broad consensus on important issues, within both the political community and society as a whole. In 2017, ''[[The Economist]]'' ranked the Netherlands as the 11th [[Democracy Index|most democratic country in the world]].\n\nThe [[Dutch monarchy|monarch]] is the [[head of state]], at present King [[Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands]]. Constitutionally, the position is equipped with limited powers.<!-- Commented out: \"The monarch can exert some influence during the formation of a new cabinet, where they serve as neutral arbiter between the political parties.\" INFO: The Dutch Lower House (Tweede Kamer) relieved the monarch of this role on 27 March 2012. --> By law, the King has the right to be periodically briefed and consulted on government affairs.

The cabinet usually consists of 13 to 16 ministers and a varying number of [[State Secretary (Netherlands)|state secretaries]]. One to three ministers are [[Minister without portfolio|ministers without portfolio]]. The [[head of government]] is the [[Prime Minister of the Netherlands]], who often is the leader of the largest party of the coalition. The Prime Minister is a ''[[primus inter pares]]'', with no explicit powers beyond those of the other ministers. [[Mark Rutte]] has been Prime Minister since October 2010; the Prime Minister had been the leader of the largest party continuously since 1973.\n\nThe cabinet is [[Ministerial responsibility|responsible]] to the [[Bicameralism|bicameral]] [[parliament]], the [[States General of the Netherlands|States General]], which also has [[Legislative|legislative powers]]. The 150 members of the [[House of Representatives (Netherlands)|House of Representatives]], the [[lower house]], are elected in [[direct election]]s on the basis of [[party-list proportional representation]]. These are held every four years, or sooner in case the cabinet falls (for example: when one of the chambers carries a [[motion of no confidence]], the cabinet offers its resignation to the monarch). The [[States-Provincial]] are directly elected every four years as well. The members of the provincial assemblies elect the 75 members of the [[Senate (Netherlands)|Senate]], the [[upper house]], which has the power to reject laws, but not propose or amend them. Both houses send members to the [[Benelux Parliament]], a consultative council.\n\n===Political culture===\nBoth trade unions and [[employers organisation]]s are consulted beforehand in policymaking in the financial, economic and social areas. They meet regularly with the government in the [[Social-Economic Council]].

Since suffrage became universal [[Pacification of 1917|in 1917]], the Dutch political system has been dominated by three families of political parties: the strongest of which were the [[Christian democracy|Christian Democrats]], currently represented by the [[Christian Democratic Appeal]] (CDA); second were the [[Social democracy|Social Democrats]], represented by the [[Labour Party (Netherlands)|Labour Party]] (PvdA); and third were the [[Liberalism in the Netherlands|Liberals]], of which the right-wing [[People's Party for Freedom and Democracy]] (VVD) is the main representative.\n\nThese parties co-operated in coalition cabinets in which the Christian Democrats had always been a partner: so either a centre-left coalition of the Christian Democrats and Social Democrats was ruling or a centre-right coalition of Christian Democrats and Liberals. In the 1970s, the [[party system]] became more volatile: the Christian Democratic parties lost seats, while new parties became successful, such as the [[Radicalism (historical)|radical democrat]] and [[Progressivism|progressive]] liberal [[Democrats 66]] (D66) or the [[Ecology|ecologist]] party [[GroenLinks]] (GL).\n\nIn the [[Dutch general election, 1994|1994 election]], the CDA lost its dominant position. A \"[[Purple (government)|purple]]\" cabinet was formed by the VVD, D66, and PvdA. In the [[Dutch general election, 2002|2002 elections]], this cabinet lost its majority, because of an increased support for the CDA and the rise of the right [[Lijst Pim Fortuyn|LPF]], a new political party, around [[Pim Fortuyn]], who was assassinated a week before the elections. A short-lived [[First Balkenende cabinet|cabinet]] was formed by CDA, VVD, and LPF, which was led by the CDA Leader [[Jan Peter Balkenende]]. After the [[Dutch general election, 2003|2003 elections]], in which the LPF lost most of its seats, a [[Balkenende II|cabinet]] was formed by the CDA, VVD, and D66.

relations===\n{{Main|Foreign relations of the Netherlands|List of diplomatic missions of the Netherlands}}\n[[File:International Court of Justice.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Peace Palace]] (''Vredespaleis''), in [[The Hague]]]]\nThe history of [[foreign relations of the Netherlands|Dutch foreign policy]] has been characterised by its [[neutral state|neutrality]]. Since World War II, the Netherlands has become a member of a large number of international organisations, most prominently the UN, [[NATO]] and the EU. The Dutch economy is very open and relies strongly on [[international trade]].\n\nThe [[foreign policy]] of the Netherlands is based on four basic commitments: to [[atlanticism|Atlantic co-operation]], to [[European integration]], to [[international development]] and to [[international law]]. One of the more controversial international issues surrounding the Netherlands is its [[Drug policy of the Netherlands|liberal policy towards soft drugs]].\n\nDuring and after the [[Dutch Golden Age]], the Dutch people built up a commercial and colonial empire. The most important colonies were present-day [[Suriname]] and [[Indonesia]]. Indonesia became independent after the [[Indonesian National Revolution]] in the 1940s following a war of independence, international pressure and several [[United Nations Security Council resolution]]s. Suriname became independent in 1975. The historical ties inherited from its colonial past still influence the foreign relations of the Netherlands. In addition, many people from these countries are living permanently in the Netherlands.\n\n===Military===\n{{Main|Armed forces of the Netherlands}}\n[[File:Rob Bauer.jpg|thumb|Lieutenant admiral [[Rob Bauer]] is the current [[Chief of Defence (Netherlands)|Chief of Defence]].]]\nThe Netherlands has one of the oldest standing armies in Europe; it was first established as such by [[Maurice of Nassau]] in the late 1500s. The Dutch army was used throughout the [[Dutch Empire]]. After the defeat of Napoleon, the Dutch army was transformed into a [[conscription]] army. The army was unsuccessfully deployed during the [[Belgian Revolution]] in 1830. After 1830, it was deployed mainly in the Dutch colonies, as the Netherlands remained neutral in European wars (including the First World War), until the [[Battle of the Netherlands|Netherlands was invaded in World War II]] and defeated by the Wehrmacht in May 1940.\n\n[[File:HNLMS Holland.jpg|thumb|''Zr. Ms. Holland'', a [[Royal Netherlands Navy]] [[offshore patrol vessel]]]]\nThe Netherlands abandoned its neutrality in 1948 when it signed the [[Treaty of Brussels]], and became a founding member of [[NATO]] in 1949. The Dutch military was therefore part of the NATO strength in [[Cold War]] Europe, deploying its army to several bases in Germany. More than 3,000 Dutch soldiers were assigned to the [[2nd Infantry Division (United States)|2nd Infantry Division]] of the [[United States Army]] during the [[Korean War]]. In 1996 conscription was suspended, and the Dutch army was once again transformed into a professional army. Since the 1990s the Dutch army has been involved in the [[Bosnian War]] and the [[Kosovo War]], it held a province in [[Iraq]] after the defeat of [[Saddam Hussein]], and it was engaged in [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|Afghanistan]].\n\nThe military is composed of four branches, all of which carry the prefix ''Koninklijke'' (Royal):\n<!-- Pls do not change any of these from 'Royal Netherlands' to 'Dutch', the official name of ALL branches of the Army is Royal Netherlands-->\n* ''Koninklijke Marine'' (KM), the [[Royal Netherlands Navy]], including the Naval Air Service and Marine Corps;\n* ''Koninklijke Landmacht'' (KL), the [[Royal Netherlands Army]];\n* ''Koninklijke Luchtmacht'' (KLu), the [[Royal Netherlands Air Force]];\n* ''Koninklijke Marechaussee'' (KMar), the [[Royal Marechaussee]] (Military Police), tasks include military police and border control.\n\nThe submarine service is open to women as of 1 January 2017.

It comprises eight grades, the first of which is facultative. Based on an aptitude test, the eighth grade teacher's recommendation and the opinion of the pupil's parents or caretakers, a choice is made for one of the three main streams of secondary education. After completing a particular stream, a pupil may still continue in the penultimate year of the next stream.\n\nThe [[Voorbereidend middelbaar beroepsonderwijs|VMBO]] has 4 grades and is subdivided over several levels. Successfully completing the vmbo results in a low-level vocational degree that grants access to the MBO. The MBO (middle-level applied education) is a form of education primarily focuses on teaching a practical trade, or a vocational degree. With the MBO certification, a student can apply for the HBO. The [[Hoger algemeen voortgezet onderwijs|HAVO]] has 5 grades and allows for admission to the HBO. The HBO (higher professional education) are [[Vocational university|universities of professional education]] (applied sciences) that award professional bachelor's degrees; similar to polytechnic degrees. A HBO degree gives access to the university system. The [[Voorbereidend wetenschappelijk onderwijs|VWO]] (comprising [[Atheneum (school)|atheneum]] and [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]]) has 6 grades and prepares for studying at a research university. Universities offer of a three-year bachelor's degree, followed by a one or two year master's degree, which in turn can be followed by a four or five-year [[doctoral degree]] program.\n\nDoctoral candidates in the Netherlands are generally non-tenured employees of a university. All Dutch schools and universities are publicly funded and managed with the exception of religious schools that are publicly funded but not managed by the state even though requirements are necessary for the funding to be authorised. Dutch universities have a tuition fee of about 2,000 euros a year for students from the Netherlands and the European Union.

According to the HCP ([[Health Consumer Powerhouse]]), the Netherlands has 'a chaos system', meaning patients have a great degree of freedom from where to buy their health insurance, to where they get their healthcare service. The difference between the Netherlands and other countries is that the chaos is managed. Healthcare decisions are being made in a dialogue between the patients and healthcare professionals.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://healthpowerhouse.com/|title=Health Consumer Powerhouse \u2013 Health Care System's Indexes and reports}}</ref>\n\nHealth insurance in the Netherlands is mandatory. Healthcare in the Netherlands is covered by two statutory forms of insurance:\n* Zorgverzekeringswet (ZVW), often called \"basic insurance\", covers common medical care.\n* Algemene Wet Bijzondere Ziektekosten (AWBZ) covers long-term nursing and care.\n\nWhile Dutch residents are automatically insured by the government for AWBZ, everyone has to take out their own basic healthcare insurance (basisverzekering), except those under 18 who are automatically covered under their parents' premium. If a person decides not to carry out an insurance coverage, the person may be fined. Insurers have to offer a universal package for everyone over the age of 18 years, regardless of age or state of health \u2013 it's illegal to refuse an application or impose special conditions. In contrast to many other European systems, the Dutch government is responsible for the accessibility and quality of the healthcare system in the Netherlands, but not in charge of its management.\n\nHealthcare in the Netherlands can be divided in several ways: three echelons, in somatic and mental health care and in 'cure' (short term) and 'care' (long term). Home doctors (''huisartsen'', comparable to [[general practitioner]]s) form the largest part of the first echelon. Being referenced by a member of the first echelon is mandatory for access to the second and third echelon.<ref name=\"Boot\">J.M.

Long-term treatments, especially those that involve semi-permanent hospitalisation, and also disability costs such as wheelchairs, are covered by a state-controlled mandatory insurance. This is laid down in the ''[[AWBZ|Algemene Wet Bijzondere Ziektekosten]]'' (\"General Law on Exceptional Healthcare Costs\") which first came into effect in 1968. In 2009 this insurance covered 27% of all health care expenses.<ref name=\"statline.cbs.nl\">{{cite web|url=http://statline.cbs.nl/StatWeb/publication/?DM=SLNL&PA=71914ned&D1=37-43&D2=a&HDR=G1&STB=T&VW=T|title=Zorgrekeningen; uitgaven (in lopende en constante prijzen) en financiering|date=20 May 2010|publisher=Centraal Bureau voor de Statistiek: StatLine|language=Dutch|accessdate=16 May 2011}}</ref>\n\nFor all regular (short-term) medical treatment, there is a system of obligatory [[health insurance]], with private health insurance companies.

Risk variances between private health insurance companies due to the different risks presented by individual policy holders are compensated through [[Risk equalization|risk equalisation]] and a common [[risk pool]]. The funding burden for all short-term health care coverage is carried 50% by employers, 45% by the insured person and 5% by the government. Children under 18 are covered for free. Those on low incomes receive compensation to help them pay their insurance. Premiums paid by the insured are about \u20ac100 per month (about US$127 in August 2010 and \u20ac150 or US$196 in 2012), with variation of about 5% between the various competing insurers, and a yearly deductible of \u20ac220 (US$288).\n\n==Culture==\n{{Main|Culture of the Netherlands}}\n[[File:Hollande04.jpg|thumb|600px|center|<div style=\"text-align:center;\">Some symbols and icons of Dutch culture</div>]]\n\n===Art, philosophy and literature===\n{{Main|Dutch art|Architecture of the Netherlands|Dutch literature}}\n{{multiple image|perrow=2/1/1|total_width=300|caption_align=center\n| image1 = Meisje met de parel.jpg|caption1=''[[Girl with a Pearl Earring]]'' by [[Johannes Vermeer]]\n| image2 = Vincent van Gogh - Self-portrait with grey felt hat - Google Art Project.jpg|caption2=Self-portrait by [[Vincent van Gogh]]\n| image3 = Rijksmuseum 2022.jpg|caption3=The [[Rijksmuseum]]\n| image4 = NEMO and area.jpg|caption4=The National [[NEMO (museum)|NEMO Science Museum]] and the [[Nederlands Scheepvaartmuseum]] in second plan, in Amsterdam\n}}\n\nThe Netherlands has had many well-known painters.

[[Antonie van Leeuwenhoek]] was the first to observe and describe [[Microorganism|single-celled organisms]] with a [[microscope]].\n\nIn the [[Dutch Golden Age]], literature flourished as well, with [[Joost van den Vondel]] and [[Pieter Corneliszoon Hooft|P. C. Hooft]] as the two most famous writers. In the 19th century, [[Multatuli]] wrote about the poor treatment of the natives in the Dutch colony, the current Indonesia. Important 20th century authors include [[Godfried Bomans]], [[Harry Mulisch]], [[Jan Wolkers]], [[Simon Vestdijk]], [[Hella S. Haasse]], [[Cees Nooteboom]], [[Gerard Reve]] and [[Willem Frederik Hermans]]. [[Anne Frank]]'s [[The Diary of a Young Girl|''Diary of a Young Girl'']] was published after she was murdered in the Holocaust and translated from Dutch to all major languages.\n\nThe traditional Dutch architecture is especially valued in [[Amsterdam]], [[Delft]] and [[Leiden]], with 17 and 18th century buildings along the canals. Smaller village architecture with wooden houses is found in [[Zaandam]] and [[Marken]]. Replicas of Dutch buildings can be found in [[Huis Ten Bosch (theme park)|Huis Ten Bosch]], [[Nagasaki]], [[Japan]]. A similar Holland Village is being built in [[Shenyang]], [[China]]. [[Windmill]]s, [[tulip]]s, [[Clog (shoe)|wooden shoes]], cheese, [[Delftware]] pottery, and [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] are among the items associated with the Netherlands by tourists.\n\nThe Netherlands has a long history of social tolerance and today is regarded as a liberal country, considering [[Drug policy of the Netherlands|its drug policy]] and its legalisation of [[Euthanasia in the Netherlands|euthanasia]].

Traditional Dutch music is a genre known as \"[[Levenslied]]\", meaning ''Song of life'', to an extent comparable to a French [[Chanson]] or a German [[Schlager music|Schlager]]. These songs typically have a simple melody and rhythm, and a straightforward structure of couplets and choruses. Themes can be light, but are often sentimental and include [[love]], [[death]] and [[loneliness]]. Traditional musical instruments such as the [[accordion]] and the [[barrel organ]] are a staple of levenslied music, though in recent years many artists also use synthesisers and guitars. Artists in this genre include [[Jan Smit (singer)|Jan Smit]], [[Frans Bauer]] and [[Andr\u00e9 Hazes]].\n\n[[File:Anouk, ESC2013 press conference 09 (crop).jpg|thumb|upright=0.85|Pop singer [[Anouk (singer)|Anouk]] in 2013]]\n[[File:Coldplay perform \"Up&Up\", Amsterdam Arena, June 2016 (5).jpg|thumb|upright=0.85|[[Johan Cruyff Arena]], the largest Dutch concert venue]]\nContemporary Dutch [[Rock music|rock]] and [[pop music]] ([[Nederpop]]) originated in the 1960s, heavily influenced by popular music from the [[United States]] and [[United Kingdom|Britain]]. In the 1960s and 1970s the lyrics were mostly in English, and some tracks were instrumental. Bands such as [[Shocking Blue]], [[Golden Earring]], [[Tee Set]], [[George Baker Selection]] and [[Focus (band)|Focus]] enjoyed international success. As of the 1980s, more and more pop musicians started working in the Dutch language, partly inspired by the huge success of the band [[Doe Maar]]. Today Dutch rock and pop music thrives in both languages, with some artists recording in both.\n\nCurrent [[symphonic metal]] bands [[Epica (band)|Epica]], [[Delain]], [[ReVamp]], [[The Gathering (band)|The Gathering]], [[Asrai]], [[Autumn]], [[Ayreon]] and [[Within Temptation]] as well as [[jazz]] and pop singer [[Caro Emerald]] are having international success. Also, metal bands like [[Hail of Bullets]], [[God Dethroned]], [[Izegrim]], [[Asphyx]], [[Textures (band)|Textures]], [[Present Danger]], [[Heidevolk]] and [[Slechtvalk]] are popular guests at the biggest [[metal festival]]s in Europe.

Tracks like \"[[Get Ready for This]]\" are still popular themes of U.S. sports events, like the [[NHL]]. In the mid 1990s Dutch language [[Hip hop music|rap and hip hop]] (''[[Dutch hip hop|Nederhop]]'') also came to fruition and has become popular in the Netherlands and Belgium. Artists with North African, Caribbean or Middle Eastern origins have strongly influenced this genre.\n\nSince the 1990s, Dutch [[electronic dance music]] (EDM) gained widespread popularity in the world in many forms, from [[trance music|trance]], [[techno]] and [[gabber]] to [[hardstyle]]. Some of the world's best known dance music DJs hail from the Netherlands, including [[Armin van Buuren]], [[Ti\u00ebsto]], [[Hardwell]], [[Martin Garrix]], [[Dash Berlin]], [[Julian Jordan]], [[Nicky Romero]], [[W&W]], [[Don Diablo]] and [[Afrojack]]; the first four of which have been ranked as best in the world by [[DJ Mag Top 100 DJs]].

Their most recent win was in [[Eurovision Song Contest 2019|2019]].\n\nIn [[classical music]], [[Jan Sweelinck]] ranks as the Dutch most famous composer, with [[Louis Andriessen]] amongst the best known living Dutch classical composers. [[Ton Koopman]] is a Dutch conductor, organist and harpsichordist. He is also professor at the Royal Conservatory of The Hague. Notable violinists are [[Janine Jansen]] and [[Andr\u00e9 Rieu]]. The latter, together with his [[Johann Strauss Orchestra]], has taken classical and [[waltz (music)|waltz music]] on worldwide concert tours, the size and revenue of which are otherwise only seen from the world's biggest rock and pop music acts.

Federations for sports were established (such as the speed skating federation in 1882), rules were unified and sports clubs came into existence. A [[NOC*NSF|Dutch National Olympic Committee]] was established in 1912. Thus far, the nation has won 266 medals at the [[Summer Olympic Games]] and another 110 medals at the [[Winter Olympic Games]]. In international competition, Dutch national teams and athletes are dominant in several fields of sport. The [[Netherlands women's national field hockey team|Netherlands women's field hockey team]] is the most successful team in [[Women's Hockey World Cup|World Cup]] history. The [[Netherlands national baseball team|Netherlands baseball team]] have won the [[European Baseball Championship|European championship]] 20 times out of 32 events.

Dutch cuisine is simple and straightforward, and contains many dairy products. Breakfast and lunch are typically bread with toppings, with cereal for breakfast as an alternative. Traditionally, dinner consists of potatoes, a portion of meat, and (seasonal) vegetables. The Dutch diet was relatively high in carbohydrates and fat, reflecting the dietary needs of the labourers whose culture moulded the country. Without many refinements, it is best described as rustic, though many holidays are still celebrated with special foods. In the course of the twentieth century this diet changed and became much more [[Multiculturalism|cosmopolitan]], with most [[global cuisine]]s being represented in the major cities.\n\nModern culinary writers distinguish between three general regional forms of Dutch cuisine. The regions in the northeast of the Netherlands, roughly the provinces of [[Groningen (province)|Groningen]], [[Friesland]], [[Drenthe]], [[Overijssel]] and [[Gelderland]] north of the [[Grote rivieren|great rivers]] are the least populated areas of the Netherlands. The late (18th century) introduction of large scale agriculture means that the cuisine is generally known for its many kinds of meats. The relative lack of farms allowed for an abundance of [[game (meat)|game]] and [[Animal husbandry|husbandry]], though dishes near the coastal regions of Friesland, Groningen and the parts of Overijssel bordering the [[IJsselmeer]] also include a large amount of fish. The various dried sausages, belonging to the [[metworst]]-family of Dutch sausages are found throughout this region and are highly prized for their often very strong taste. Also smoked sausages are common, of which (''Gelderse'') ''[[rookworst]]'' is the most renowned. The sausage contains a lot of fat and is very juicy. Larger sausages are often eaten alongside ''[[stamppot]]'', ''[[hutspot]]'' or ''zuurkool'' ([[sauerkraut]]); whereas smaller ones are often eaten as a [[street food]]. The provinces are also home to hard textured [[rye bread]], pastries and cookies, the latter heavily spiced with [[ginger]] or [[succade]] or contain small bits of meat. Various kinds of ''Kruidkoek'' (such as [[:nl:Groninger koek|Groninger koek]]), ''[[:nl:Fryske d\u00famkes|Fryske d\u00famkes]]'' and ''[[:nl:spekdik|spekdikken]]'' (small savory pancakes cooked in a waffle iron) are considered typical. Notable characteristics of ''Fries roggebrood'' (Frisian rye bread) is its long baking time (up to 20 hours), resulting in a sweet taste and a deep dark colour.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.warenkennis.nl/graan/soorten.htm|title=Graansoorten|website=Warenkennis.nl|accessdate=3 August 2017}}</ref> In terms of alcoholic beverages, the region is renowned for its many [[bitters]] (such as ''[[Beerenburg]]'') and other high-proof liquors rather than beer, which is, apart from ''[[Jenever]]'', typical for the rest of the country. As a coastal region, Friesland is home to low-lying grasslands, and thus has a cheese production in common with the Western cuisine. ''Friese Nagelkaas'' ([[Friesian Clove]]) is a notable example.\n\nThe provinces of [[North Holland]], [[South Holland]], [[Zeeland]], and [[Utrecht (province)|Utrecht]] and the Gelderlandic area of [[Betuwe]] make up the region in which western Dutch cuisine is found. Because of the abundance of water and flat grasslands that are found here, the area is known for its many dairy products, which include prominent cheeses such as [[Gouda (cheese)|Gouda]], [[Leyden cheese|Leyden]] (spiced cheese with cumin), and [[Edam (cheese)|Edam]] (traditionally in small spheres) as well as [[Leerdammer]] and [[Beemster Cheese|Beemster]], while the adjacent [[Zaanstreek]] in [[North Holland]] has since the 16th century beem known for its [[mayonnaise]], typical whole-grain [[mustard (condiment)|mustards]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smulweb.nl/blog/tonia/718/de-geschiedenis-van-de-mosterd|title=De geschiedenis van de mosterd - Smulweb Blog|date=5 May 2000}}</ref> and [[chocolate]] industry. Zeeland and South Holland produce a lot of butter, which contains a larger amount of [[milkfat]] than most other European butter varieties. A by-product of the butter-making process, ''karnemelk'' ([[buttermilk]]), is also considered typical for this region. [[Seafood]] such as [[soused herring]], [[Blue mussel|mussels]] (called ''Zeeuwse Mossels'', since all Dutch mussels for consumption are cleaned in Zeeland's [[Oosterschelde]]), [[European eel|eels]], [[oyster]]s and [[shrimp]]s are widely available and typical for the region. ''[[:nl:Kibbeling|Kibbeling]]'', once a local delicacy consisting of small chunks of battered [[Whitefish (fisheries term)|white fish]], has become a national [[fast food]], just as [[:nl:Lekkerbekje|lekkerbek]]. Pastries in this area tend to be quite doughy, and often contain large amounts of sugar; either caramelised, powdered or crystallised. The ''[[oliebol]]'' (in its modern form) and ''[[Zeeuwse bolus]]'' are good examples. Cookies are also produced in great number and tend to contain a lot of butter and sugar, like ''[[stroopwafel]]'', as well as a filling of some kind, mostly almond, like ''[[:nl:Gevulde koek|gevulde koek]]''. The traditional alcoholic beverages of this region are [[beer]] (strong pale lager) and ''[[Jenever]]'', a high proof [[juniper]]-flavored spirit, that came to be known in England as [[gin]]. A noted exception within the traditional Dutch alcoholic landscape, ''[[Advocaat]]'', a rich and creamy liqueur made from eggs, sugar and brandy, is also native to this region.\n\nThe Southern Dutch cuisine consists of the cuisines of the Dutch provinces of [[North Brabant]] and [[Limburg (Netherlands)|Limburg]] and the [[Flemish Region]] in [[Belgium]]. It is renowned for its many rich pastries, soups, stews and vegetable dishes and is often called Burgundian which is a Dutch idiom invoking the rich Burgundian court which ruled the Low Countries in the Middle Ages, renowned for its splendor and great feasts. It is the only Dutch culinary region that developed an [[haute cuisine]]. Pastries are abundant, often with rich fillings of cream, custard or fruits. Cakes, such as the ''[[Vlaai]]'' from Limburg and the ''Moorkop'' and ''[[Bossche Bol]]'' from Brabant, are typical pastries. Savoury pastries also occur, with the {{lang|nl|worstenbroodje}} (a roll with a sausage of [[ground beef]], literally translates into sausage bread) being the most popular. The traditional alcoholic beverage of the region is beer. There are many local brands, ranging from ''[[Trappist beer|Trappist]]'' to ''[[Kriek lambic|Kriek]]''. 5 of the 10 ''International Trappist Association'' recognised breweries in the world, are located in the Southern Dutch cultural area. Beer, like wine in French cuisine, is also used in cooking; often in stews.\n\nIn early 2014, [[Oxfam]] ranked the Netherlands as the country with the most nutritious, plentiful and healthy food, in a comparison of 125 countries.<ref>{{cite news |last=Reaney |first=Patricia |date=14 January 2014 |title=Netherlands is country with most plentiful, healthy food: Oxfam |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/01/15/us-food-countries-idUSBREA0E01S20140115 |newspaper= |location=New York |publisher=Reuters U.S. |accessdate=1 September 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite press release |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Good Enough to Eat \u2013 Media Briefing|url=http://www.oxfamamerica.org/static/media/files/Good_Enough_To_Eat_Media_brief_FINAL.pdf |location=Boston, MA |publisher=[[Oxfam]] America |agency= |date=14 January 2013 |accessdate=1 September 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Colonial heritage===\n{{Main|Dutch Empire}}\n{{further|Dutch East Indies|Indos in the Dutch East Indies}}\n[[File:GezichtOpNieuwAmsterdam.jpg|200px|thumb|left|[[New Amsterdam]] as it appeared in 1664.

Attempting to ask directions to the [[Reich Chancellery]], Hitler is told by a mime to find his own spot and pepper-sprayed by a terrified young mother. Arriving at a newspaper kiosk and reading that it is 2014, he becomes dizzy and faints.\n\nMeanwhile, moviemaker Fabian Sawatzki ([[Fabian Busch]]) is fired from the television station MyTV and despondently watches the documentary he had been filming in the park where Hitler awoke. Seeing Hitler in the background, Sawatzki begins searching for him in hopes of getting his job back.\n\nWaking at the kiosk, Hitler begins to read about modern Germany. Through the newspapers he discovers a completely different nation from the one he left and not one agreeable to him. Lamenting that Poland still exists on formerly German soil, Hitler says the whole war was a waste. He decides that destiny has resurrected him for a reason and vows to continue his work.\n\nAfter finding the kiosk, Sawatzki proposes to travel across Germany with Hitler and film him for [[YouTube]]. Hitler agrees, and the two leave together. Travelling from the North Sea Coast to Bavaria, Sawatzki films Hitler interacting with ordinary Germans and promising to solve their problems with immigrants and guest-workers. When a Bavarian tells Hitler that he will never follow him, Hitler demands his name and address, saying that it's for \"the first wave of arrests\". The Bavarian responds that he isn't worried.\n\nSawatzki's idea for an animal-centred film clip ends when Hitler shoots a dog with a concealed [[FN Model 1910]] pistol. Sawatzki is outraged, but Hitler calls him a weakling and vows to make a man out of him. While their videos gain over a million hits, Sawatzki and Hitler return to Berlin. Sawatzki introduces both Hitler and his programme idea to the MyTV station chiefs. The MyTV chairman, Katja Bellini ([[Katja Riemann]]), decides to use Hitler in one of MyTV's comedies.\n\nBefore the show, Hitler learns about the [[Internet]] and uses the [[World Wide Web|Web]] to prepare his return to politics. On air, Hitler presents his old plans for an ethnically homogeneous [[Fascist]] state, and unintentionally becomes a big comedy hit. As his success in comedy increases, Christoph Sensebrink ([[Christoph Maria Herbst]]), one of MyTV's executives, discovers the unedited footage of Hitler shooting the dog. Sensebrink airs the footage, ruining the burgeoning careers of Hitler, Sawatzki, and Bellini, and resulting in his own promotion to station chief.\n\nWith the help of Bellini and Sawatzki, Hitler publishes an autobiographical book about his new life in the 21st century, ''Er Ist Wieder Da'' (\"Look Who's Back\"), and it becomes a bestseller. Soon after, Sawatzki turns the book into a film. Without Hitler, MyTV's ratings and ad revenue drop precipitously and Sensebrink, after a fit of rage (parodying Hitler's breakdown scene in the German drama film ''[[Downfall (2004 film)#Parodies|Downfall]]''), decides he must rehire Hitler.\n\nHitler plays himself in the movie and during the filming he is beaten by two [[Neo-Nazis]] who believe him to be a fraudulent impersonator mocking their beliefs. Hitler is hospitalised, but the news of his beating generates sympathy and he returns to high standing with the German people. While Hitler is recuperating, Sawatzki reviews his old footage and discovers a ball of energy (based on ''[[The Terminator]]'') in the background before Hitler first appeared. Returning to the site, he finds burnt leaves. With horror, he realises that the Hitler he encountered was the real person all along. He rushes to the hospital to confront Hitler, but finds only Katja, who says Hitler is at the movie studio. Katja doesn't understand Sawatzki when he says Hitler is real and he trashes the hospital room before running for the exit pursued by two hospital orderlies.\n\nSawatzki arrives at the movie studio, where he forces Hitler to the roof at gunpoint with his own pistol. Calmly, Hitler replies that he was elected by the German people, and if he is a monster, then so is everyone who voted for him. Enraged, Sawatzki shoots Hitler in the face and watches him fall off the roof to his apparent death. Suddenly Hitler reappears behind Sawatzki, claiming he cannot be killed, as he is a part of every German. This entire scene is revealed to be a part of the film, and Sawatzki a [[body double]] in a silicone mask.

Attempting to ask directions to the [[Reich Chancellery]], Hitler is told by a mime to find his own spot and pepper-sprayed by a terrified young mother. Arriving at a newspaper kiosk and reading that it is 2014, he becomes dizzy and faints.\n\nMeanwhile, moviemaker Fabian Sawatzki ([[Fabian Busch]]) is fired from the television station MyTV and despondently watches the documentary he had been filming in the park where Hitler awoke. Seeing Hitler in the background, Sawatzki begins searching for him in hopes of getting his job back.\n\nWaking at the kiosk, Hitler begins to read about modern Germany. Through the newspapers he discovers a completely different nation from the one he left and not one agreeable to him. Lamenting that Poland still exists on formerly German soil, Hitler says the whole war was a waste. He decides that destiny has resurrected him for a reason and vows to continue his work.\n\nAfter finding the kiosk, Sawatzki proposes to travel across Germany with Hitler and film him for [[YouTube]]. Hitler agrees, and the two leave together. Travelling from the North Sea Coast to Bavaria, Sawatzki films Hitler interacting with ordinary Germans and promising to solve their problems with immigrants and guest-workers. When a Bavarian tells Hitler that he will never follow him, Hitler demands his name and address, saying that it's for \"the first wave of arrests\". The Bavarian responds that he isn't worried.\n\nSawatzki's idea for an animal-centred film clip ends when Hitler shoots a dog with a concealed [[FN Model 1910]] pistol. Sawatzki is outraged, but Hitler calls him a weakling and vows to make a man out of him. While their videos gain over a million hits, Sawatzki and Hitler return to Berlin. Sawatzki introduces both Hitler and his programme idea to the MyTV station chiefs. The MyTV chairman, Katja Bellini ([[Katja Riemann]]), decides to use Hitler in one of MyTV's comedies.\n\nBefore the show, Hitler learns about the [[Internet]] and uses the [[World Wide Web|Web]] to prepare his return to politics. On air, Hitler presents his old plans for an ethnically homogeneous [[Fascist]] state, and unintentionally becomes a big comedy hit. As his success in comedy increases, Christoph Sensebrink ([[Christoph Maria Herbst]]), one of MyTV's executives, discovers the unedited footage of Hitler shooting the dog. Sensebrink airs the footage, ruining the burgeoning careers of Hitler, Sawatzki, and Bellini, and resulting in his own promotion to station chief.\n\nWith the help of Bellini and Sawatzki, Hitler publishes an autobiographical book about his new life in the 21st century, ''Er Ist Wieder Da'' (\"Look Who's Back\"), and it becomes a bestseller. Soon after, Sawatzki turns the book into a film. Without Hitler, MyTV's ratings and ad revenue drop precipitously and Sensebrink, after a fit of rage (parodying Hitler's breakdown scene in the German drama film ''[[Downfall (2004 film)#Parodies|Downfall]]''), decides he must rehire Hitler.\n\nHitler plays himself in the movie and during the filming he is beaten by two [[Neo-Nazis]] who believe him to be a fraudulent impersonator mocking their beliefs. Hitler is hospitalised, but the news of his beating generates sympathy and he returns to high standing with the German people. While Hitler is recuperating, Sawatzki reviews his old footage and discovers a ball of energy (based on ''[[The Terminator]]'') in the background before Hitler first appeared. Returning to the site, he finds burnt leaves. With horror, he realises that the Hitler he encountered was the real person all along. He rushes to the hospital to confront Hitler, but finds only Katja, who says Hitler is at the movie studio. Katja doesn't understand Sawatzki when he says Hitler is real and he trashes the hospital room before running for the exit pursued by two hospital orderlies.\n\nSawatzki arrives at the movie studio, where he forces Hitler to the roof at gunpoint with his own pistol. Calmly, Hitler replies that he was elected by the German people, and if he is a monster, then so is everyone who voted for him. Enraged, Sawatzki shoots Hitler in the face and watches him fall off the roof to his apparent death. Suddenly Hitler reappears behind Sawatzki, claiming he cannot be killed, as he is a part of every German. This entire scene is revealed to be a part of the film, and Sawatzki a [[body double]] in a silicone mask. The real Sawatzki has been committed to a [[mental hospital]] following his previous outburst.\n\nOnce the work for his film finishes, Hitler senses that he is on the path to a political comeback. He is more popular than ever, and nationalist Germans give him hope that Germany may be ready for his return to power. With Hitler and Bellini riding in the back seat of an open Mercedes-Benz W31 convertible and among images of actual nationalist demonstrations, the film ends with Hitler's words, \"I can work with this\".\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Oliver Masucci]] as [[Adolf Hitler]]\n* [[Fabian Busch]] as Fabian Sawatzki\n* [[Katja Riemann]] as Katja Bellini\n* [[Christoph Maria Herbst]] as Christoph Sensenbrink\n* [[:de:Franziska Wulf|Franziska Wulf]] as Franziska Kr\u00f6meier\n* [[Michael Kessler]] as Michael Witzigmann\n* [[Thomas Thieme]] as K\u00e4rrner, TV-station boss\n* [[Michael Ostrowski]] as Rico Mancello\n* [[Lars Rudolph]] as kiosk owner\n* [[:de:Ramona Kunze-Libnow|Ramona Kunze-Libnow]] as Sawatzki's mother\n* [[Gudrun Ritter]] as Grandma Kr\u00f6meier\n* [[Stephan Grossmann]] as Prosecutor G\u00f6ttlicher\n}}\n\nAs themselves in cameos (German TV and internet personalities): [[Klaas Heufer-Umlauf]], [[Joko Winterscheidt]], [[Frank Plasberg]], [[Daniel Aminati]], [[:de:J\u00f6rg Thadeusz|J\u00f6rg Thadeusz]], [[Roberto Blanco]], [[Micaela Sch\u00e4fer]], [[:de:Dagi Bee|Dagi Bee]], [[:de:Freshtorge|Freshtorge]], [[:de:Robert Hofmann (Schauspieler)|Robert Hofmann]], [[:de:Joyce Ilg|Joyce Ilg]], [[Andrea Nahles]], [[Nina Proll]]\n\n==Box office==\nThe film was a box office success, reaching number one in Germany in its third week of release.<ref>{{cite newspaper |last=Lee |first=Benjamin |date=27 October 2015 |title=Hitler comedy Look Who's Back becomes Germany's No 1 movie |newspaper=The Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/oct/27/hitler-comedy-look-whos-back-germany-movie-box-office |accessdate=29 May 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Remake==\nThe film was remade in Italy as ''[[I'm Back (film)|Sono tornato]]'' (''I'm Back'').

To obtain meaningful results, the separation must be done in the sequence specified below, as some ions of an earlier group may also react with the reagent of a later group, causing ambiguity as to which ions are present. This happens because cationic analysis is based on the [[solubility product]]s of the ions. As the cation gains its optimum concentration needed for precipitation it precipitates and hence allowing us to detect it.  The division and precise details of separating into groups vary slightly from one source to another; given below is one of the commonly used schemes.\n\n=== 1st analytical group of cations ===\nThe ''1st analytical group of cations'' consists of ions that form insoluble [[chloride]]s. As such, the group reagent to separate them is [[hydrochloric acid]], usually used at a [[concentration]] of 1&ndash;2 [[molar solution|M]]. Concentrated HCl must not be used, because it forms a soluble complex ([PbCl<sub>4</sub>]<sup>2\u2212</sup>) with [[lead|Pb<sup>2+</sup>]]. Consequently, the [[lead|Pb<sup>2+</sup>]] ion would go undetected.\n\nThe most important cations in the 1st group are [[silver|Ag<sup>+</sup>]], [[Mercury (element)|Hg{{su|b=2|p=2+}}]], and [[lead|Pb<sup>2+</sup>]].  The chlorides of these elements cannot be distinguished from each other by their colour - they are all white solid compounds. PbCl<sub>2</sub> is soluble in hot water, and can therefore be differentiated easily.  Ammonia is used as a reagent to distinguish between the other two.  While AgCl dissolves in ammonia (due to the formation of the complex ion [Ag(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>]<sup>+</sup>), Hg<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub> gives a black precipitate consisting of a mixture of chloro-mercuric amide and elemental mercury. Furthermore, AgCl is reduced to silver under light, which gives samples a violet colour.\n\nPbCl<sub>2</sub> is far more soluble than the chlorides of the other two ions, especially in hot water. Therefore, HCl in concentrations which completely precipitate Hg{{su|b=2|p=2+}} and Ag<sup>+</sup> may not be sufficient to do the same to Pb<sup>2+</sup>. Higher concentrations of Cl<sup>&minus;</sup> cannot be used for the before mentioned reasons. Thus, a filtrate obtained after first group analysis of Pb<sup>2+</sup> contains an appreciable concentration of this cation, enough to give the test of the second group, viz. formation of an insoluble sulfide. For this reason, Pb<sup>2+</sup> is usually also included in the 2nd analytical group.\n\nThis group can be determined by adding the salt in water and then adding dilute hydrochloric acid. A white precipitate is formed, to which ammonia is then added. If the precipitate is insoluble, then Pb<sup>2+</sup> is present; if the precipitate is soluble, then Ag<sup>+</sup> is present, and if the white precipitate turns black, then Hg{{su|b=2|p=2+}} is present. \n\nConfirmation test for Pb<sup>2+</sup>: \n:Pb<sup>2+</sup> + 2 KI \u2192 PbI<sub>2</sub> + 2 K<sup>+</sup>\n:Pb<sup>2+</sup> + K<sub>2</sub>CrO<sub>4</sub> \u2192 PbCrO<sub>4</sub> + 2 K<sup>+</sup>\n\nConfirmation test for Ag<sup>+</sup>:\n:Ag<sup>+</sup> + KI \u2192 AgI +  K<sup>+</sup>\n:2Ag<sup>+</sup> + K<sub>2</sub>CrO<sub>4</sub> \u2192 Ag<sub>2</sub>CrO<sub>4</sub> + 2 K<sup>+</sup>\n\nConfirmation test for Hg{{Su|p=2+|b=2}}:\n:Hg{{su|b=2|p=2+}} + 2 KI \u2192 Hg<sub>2</sub>I<sub>2</sub> + 2 K<sup>+</sup>\n:2 Hg{{su|b=2|p=2+}} + 2 NaOH \u2192 2 Hg{{su|b=2}}O + 2 Na<sup>+</sup> + H<sub>2</sub>O\n\n=== 2nd analytical group of cations ===\n\nThe ''2nd analytical group of cations'' consists of ions that form acid-insoluble [[sulphide]]s. Cations in the 2nd group include: Cd<sup>2+</sup>, [[bismuth|Bi<sup>3+</sup>]], [[copper|Cu<sup>2+</sup>]], [[arsenic|As<sup>3+</sup>]], As<sup>5+</sup>, [[antimony|Sb<sup>3+</sup>]], Sb<sup>5+</sup>, Sn<sup>2+</sup>, Sn<sup>4+</sup> and Hg<sup>2+</sup>. Pb<sup>2+</sup> is usually also included here in addition to the first group. Although these methods refer to solutions that contain sulphide (S<sup>2\u2212</sup>), these solutions actually only contain H<sub>2</sub>S and [[bisulphide]] (HS<sup>\u2212</sup>).  Sulphide (S<sup>2\u2212</sup>) does not exist in appreciable concentrations in water.\n\nThe reagent used can be any substance that gives S<sup>2&minus;</sup> ions in such solutions; most commonly used are [[hydrogen sulphide]] (at 0.2-0.3 M), [[thioacetamide]] (at 0.3-0.6 M), addition of hydrogen sulphide can often prove to be a lumbersome process and therefore sodium sulphide can also serve the purpose.  The test with the sulfide ion must be conducted in the presence of dilute HCl.  Its purpose is to keep the sulphide ion concentration at a required minimum, so as to allow the precipitation of 2nd group cations alone. If dilute acid is not used, the early precipitation of 3rd group cations (if present in solution) may occur, thus leading to misleading results. Acids beside HCl are rarely used. Sulphuric acid may lead to the precipitation of the 5th group cations, whereas nitric acid oxidises the sulphide ion in the reagent, forming colloidal sulphur.\n\nThe precipitates of these cations are almost indistinguishable, except for [[Cadmium sulphide|CdS]], which is yellow. All the precipitates, except for [[Cinnabar|HgS]], are soluble in dilute nitric acid. HgS is soluble only in [[aqua regia]], which can be used to separate it from the rest. The action of ammonia is also useful in differentiating the cations. CuS dissolves in ammonia forming an intense blue solution, whereas CdS dissolves forming a colourless solution. The sulphides of As<sup>3+</sup>, As<sup>5+</sup>, Sb<sup>3+</sup>, Sb<sup>5+</sup>, Sn<sup>2+</sup>, Sn<sup>4+</sup> are soluble in yellow [[ammonium sulphide]], where they form [[polysulphide]] complexes.\n\nThis group is determined by adding the salt in water and then adding dilute hydrochloric acid (to make the medium acidic) followed by hydrogen sulphide gas.

The reagent usually used is [[ammonium carbonate|(NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>]] (at around 0.2 M), with a neutral or slightly basic pH. All the cations in the previous groups are separated beforehand, since many of them also form insoluble carbonates.\n\nThe most important ions in the 5th group are [[barium|Ba<sup>2+</sup>]], [[calcium|Ca<sup>2+</sup>]], and [[strontium|Sr<sup>2+</sup>]]. After separation, the easiest way to distinguish between these ions is by testing flame colour: barium gives a yellow-green flame, calcium gives brick red, and strontium, crimson red.\n\n=== 6th analytical group of cations ===\nCations which are left after carefully separating previous groups are considered to be in the sixth analytical group.

All the ions are distinguished by flame color: lithium gives a red flame, sodium gives bright yellow (even in trace amounts), potassium gives violet, and magnesium, colorless (although magnesium metal burns with a bright white flame).\n\n==Detecting anions==\n\n=== 1st analytical group of anions ===\nThe ''1st group of anions'' consist of [[Carbonate|CO{{su|b=3|p=2&minus;}}]], [[Bicarbonate|HCO{{su|b=3|p=&minus;}}]], [[Acetate|CH<sub>3</sub>COO<sup>&minus;</sup>]], [[Sulfide|S<sup>2&minus;</sup>]], [[Sulfite|SO{{su|b=3|p=2&minus;}}]], [[Thiosulfate|{{chem|S|2|O}}{{su|b=3|p=2&minus;}}]] and [[Nitrite|NO{{su|b=2|p=&minus;}}]]. The reagent for Group 1 anions is dilute hydrochloric acid (HCl) or dilute sulfuric acid (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>).\n\n* Carbonates give a brisk effervescence with dilute H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> due to the release of CO<sub>2</sub>, a colorless gas which turns [[limewater]] milky due to formation of CaCO<sub>3</sub> ([[carbonatation]]).

A blood red colouration is produced upon addition of yellow FeCl<sub>3</sub>, due to formation of [[iron(III) acetate]].\n* Sulfides give the rotten egg smell of H<sub>2</sub>S when treated with dilute H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>. The presence of sulfide is confirmed by adding [[lead(II) acetate]] paper, which turns black due to the formation of PbS. Sulfides also turn solutions of red [[sodium nitroprusside]] purple.\n* Sulfites produce SO<sub>2</sub> gas, which smells of burning sulfur, when treated with dilute acid. They turn acidified K<sub>2</sub>Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> from orange to green.\n* Thiosulfates produce SO<sub>2</sub> gas when treated with dilute acid. In addition, they form a cloudy precipitate of [[sulfur]].\n* Nitrites give reddish-brown fumes of NO<sub>2</sub> when treated with dilute H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>. These fumes cause a solution of [[potassium iodide]] (KI) and [[starch]] to turn blue.\n\n=== 2nd analytical group of anions ===\nThe ''2nd group of anions'' consist of [[Chloride|Cl<sup>&minus;</sup>]], [[Bromide|Br<sup>&minus;</sup>]], [[Iodide|I<sup>&minus;</sup>]], [[Nitrate|NO{{su|b=3|p=&minus;}}]] and [[Oxalate|C{{su|b=2}}O{{su|b=4|p=2&minus;}}]]. The group reagent for Group 2 anion is concentrated sulphuric acid (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>).\n\nAfter addition of the acid, chlorides, bromides and iodides will form precipitates with [[silver nitrate]]. The precipitates are white, pale yellow, and yellow, respectively. The silver halides formed are completely soluble, partially soluble, or not soluble at all, respectively, in aqueous ammonia solution.\n\nChlorides are confirmed by the ''[[chromyl chloride]] test''. When the salt is heated with K<sub>2</sub>Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> and concentrated H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, red vapours of chromyl chloride (CrO<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>) are produced. Passing this gas through a solution of NaOH produces a yellow solution of [[sodium chromate|Na<sub>2</sub>CrO<sub>4</sub>]]. The acidified solution of Na<sub>2</sub>CrO<sub>4</sub> gives a yellow precipitate with the addition of [[lead(II) acetate|(CH<sub>3</sub>COO)<sub>2</sub>Pb]].\n\nBromides and iodides are confirmed by the ''layer test''. A sodium carbonate extract is made from the solution containing bromide or iodide, and [[chloroform|CHCl<sub>3</sub>]] or [[carbon disulfide|{{chem|CS|2}}]] is added to the solution, which separates into two layers: an orange colour in the {{chem|CHCl|3}} or {{chem|CS|2}} layer indicates the presence of Br<sup>&minus;</sup>, and a violet colour indicates the presence of I<sup>&minus;</sup>.\n\nNitrates give brown fumes with concentrated H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> due to formation of NO<sub>2</sub>. This is intensified upon adding copper turnings. Nitrate ion is confirmed by adding an aqueous solution of the salt to FeSO<sub>4</sub> and pouring concentrated H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> slowly along the sides of the test tube, which produces a brown ring around the walls of the tube, at the junction of the two liquids caused by the formation of {{chem|Fe(NO)|2+}}.<ref>{{cite book\n| title = University Chemistry, Volume 1\n| author = C.

Modern techniques such as [[atomic absorption spectroscopy]] and [[ICP-MS]] are able to quickly detect the presence and concentrations of elements using a very small amount of sample.\n\n==Sodium carbonate test==\n<!-- If you can find any reliable sources for this section, please add references. -->\nThe sodium carbonate test (not to be confused with sodium carbonate extract test) is used to distinguish between some common metal ions, which are precipitated as their respective carbonates. The test can distinguish between copper (Cu), iron (Fe), and calcium (Ca), zinc (Zn) or lead (Pb). Sodium carbonate solution is added to the salt of the metal. A blue precipitate indicates Cu<sup>2+</sup> ion. A dirty green precipitate indicates Fe<sup>2+</sup> ion. A yellow-brown precipitate indicates Fe<sup>3+</sup> ion. A white precipitate indicates Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Zn<sup>2+</sup>, or Pb<sup>2+</sup> ion. The compounds formed are, respectively, [[copper(II) carbonate]], [[iron(II) carbonate]], [[iron(III) oxide]], [[calcium carbonate]], [[zinc carbonate]], and [[lead(II) carbonate]]. This test is used to precipitate the ion present as almost all carbonates are insoluble. While this test is useful for telling these cations apart, it fails if other ions are present, because most metal carbonates are insoluble and will precipitate. In addition, calcium, zinc, and lead ions all produce white precipitates with carbonate, making it difficult to distinguish between them. Instead of sodium carbonate, [[sodium hydroxide]] may be added, this gives nearly the same colours, except that lead and zinc hydroxides are soluble in excess alkali, and can hence be distinguished from calcium.

To obtain meaningful results, the separation must be done in the sequence specified below, as some ions of an earlier group may also react with the reagent of a later group, causing ambiguity as to which ions are present. This happens because cationic analysis is based on the [[solubility product]]s of the ions. As the cation gains its optimum concentration needed for precipitation it precipitates and hence allowing us to detect it.  The division and precise details of separating into groups vary slightly from one source to another; given below is one of the commonly used schemes.\n\n=== 1st analytical group of cations ===\nThe ''1st analytical group of cations'' consists of ions that form insoluble [[chloride]]s. As such, the group reagent to separate them is [[hydrochloric acid]], usually used at a [[concentration]] of 1&ndash;2 [[molar solution|M]]. Concentrated HCl must not be used, because it forms a soluble complex ([PbCl<sub>4</sub>]<sup>2\u2212</sup>) with [[lead|Pb<sup>2+</sup>]]. Consequently, the [[lead|Pb<sup>2+</sup>]] ion would go undetected.\n\nThe most important cations in the 1st group are [[silver|Ag<sup>+</sup>]], [[Mercury (element)|Hg{{su|b=2|p=2+}}]], and [[lead|Pb<sup>2+</sup>]].  The chlorides of these elements cannot be distinguished from each other by their colour - they are all white solid compounds. PbCl<sub>2</sub> is soluble in hot water, and can therefore be differentiated easily.  Ammonia is used as a reagent to distinguish between the other two.  While AgCl dissolves in ammonia (due to the formation of the complex ion [Ag(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>]<sup>+</sup>), Hg<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub> gives a black precipitate consisting of a mixture of chloro-mercuric amide and elemental mercury. Furthermore, AgCl is reduced to silver under light, which gives samples a violet colour.\n\nPbCl<sub>2</sub> is far more soluble than the chlorides of the other two ions, especially in hot water. Therefore, HCl in concentrations which completely precipitate Hg{{su|b=2|p=2+}} and Ag<sup>+</sup> may not be sufficient to do the same to Pb<sup>2+</sup>. Higher concentrations of Cl<sup>&minus;</sup> cannot be used for the before mentioned reasons. Thus, a filtrate obtained after first group analysis of Pb<sup>2+</sup> contains an appreciable concentration of this cation, enough to give the test of the second group, viz. formation of an insoluble sulfide. For this reason, Pb<sup>2+</sup> is usually also included in the 2nd analytical group.\n\nThis group can be determined by adding the salt in water and then adding dilute hydrochloric acid. A white precipitate is formed, to which ammonia is then added. If the precipitate is insoluble, then Pb<sup>2+</sup> is present; if the precipitate is soluble, then Ag<sup>+</sup> is present, and if the white precipitate turns black, then Hg{{su|b=2|p=2+}} is present. \n\nConfirmation test for Pb<sup>2+</sup>: \n:Pb<sup>2+</sup> + 2 KI \u2192 PbI<sub>2</sub> + 2 K<sup>+</sup>\n:Pb<sup>2+</sup> + K<sub>2</sub>CrO<sub>4</sub> \u2192 PbCrO<sub>4</sub> + 2 K<sup>+</sup>\n\nConfirmation test for Ag<sup>+</sup>:\n:Ag<sup>+</sup> + KI \u2192 AgI +  K<sup>+</sup>\n:2Ag<sup>+</sup> + K<sub>2</sub>CrO<sub>4</sub> \u2192 Ag<sub>2</sub>CrO<sub>4</sub> + 2 K<sup>+</sup>\n\nConfirmation test for Hg{{Su|p=2+|b=2}}:\n:Hg{{su|b=2|p=2+}} + 2 KI \u2192 Hg<sub>2</sub>I<sub>2</sub> + 2 K<sup>+</sup>\n:2 Hg{{su|b=2|p=2+}} + 2 NaOH \u2192 2 Hg{{su|b=2}}O + 2 Na<sup>+</sup> + H<sub>2</sub>O\n\n=== 2nd analytical group of cations ===\n\nThe ''2nd analytical group of cations'' consists of ions that form acid-insoluble [[sulphide]]s. Cations in the 2nd group include: Cd<sup>2+</sup>, [[bismuth|Bi<sup>3+</sup>]], [[copper|Cu<sup>2+</sup>]], [[arsenic|As<sup>3+</sup>]], As<sup>5+</sup>, [[antimony|Sb<sup>3+</sup>]], Sb<sup>5+</sup>, Sn<sup>2+</sup>, Sn<sup>4+</sup> and Hg<sup>2+</sup>. Pb<sup>2+</sup> is usually also included here in addition to the first group. Although these methods refer to solutions that contain sulphide (S<sup>2\u2212</sup>), these solutions actually only contain H<sub>2</sub>S and [[bisulphide]] (HS<sup>\u2212</sup>).  Sulphide (S<sup>2\u2212</sup>) does not exist in appreciable concentrations in water.\n\nThe reagent used can be any substance that gives S<sup>2&minus;</sup> ions in such solutions; most commonly used are [[hydrogen sulphide]] (at 0.2-0.3 M), [[thioacetamide]] (at 0.3-0.6 M), addition of hydrogen sulphide can often prove to be a lumbersome process and therefore sodium sulphide can also serve the purpose.  The test with the sulfide ion must be conducted in the presence of dilute HCl.  Its purpose is to keep the sulphide ion concentration at a required minimum, so as to allow the precipitation of 2nd group cations alone. If dilute acid is not used, the early precipitation of 3rd group cations (if present in solution) may occur, thus leading to misleading results. Acids beside HCl are rarely used. Sulphuric acid may lead to the precipitation of the 5th group cations, whereas nitric acid oxidises the sulphide ion in the reagent, forming colloidal sulphur.\n\nThe precipitates of these cations are almost indistinguishable, except for [[Cadmium sulphide|CdS]], which is yellow. All the precipitates, except for [[Cinnabar|HgS]], are soluble in dilute nitric acid. HgS is soluble only in [[aqua regia]], which can be used to separate it from the rest. The action of ammonia is also useful in differentiating the cations. CuS dissolves in ammonia forming an intense blue solution, whereas CdS dissolves forming a colourless solution. The sulphides of As<sup>3+</sup>, As<sup>5+</sup>, Sb<sup>3+</sup>, Sb<sup>5+</sup>, Sn<sup>2+</sup>, Sn<sup>4+</sup> are soluble in yellow [[ammonium sulphide]], where they form [[polysulphide]] complexes.\n\nThis group is determined by adding the salt in water and then adding dilute hydrochloric acid (to make the medium acidic) followed by hydrogen sulphide gas. Usually it is done by passing hydrogen sulphide over the test tube for detection of  1st group cations. If it forms a reddish-brown or black precipitate then Bi<sup>3+</sup>, Cu<sup>2+</sup>, Hg<sup>2+</sup> or Pb<sup>2+</sup> is present. Otherwise, if it forms a yellow precipitate, then Cd<sup>2+</sup> or Sn<sup>4+</sup> is present; or if it forms a brown precipitate, then Sn<sup>2+</sup> must be present; or if a red orange precipitate is formed, then Sb<sup>3+</sup> is present.\n\n:Pb<sup>2+</sup> + K<sub>2</sub>CrO<sub>4</sub> \u2192 PbCrO<sub>4</sub> + 2 K<sup>+</sup>\n\nConfirmation test for copper:\n\n:2 Cu<sup>2+</sup> + K<sub>4</sub>[Fe(CN)<sub>6</sub>] + CH<sub>3</sub>COOH \u2192 Cu<sub>2</sub>[Fe(CN)<sub>6</sub>] + 4 K<sup>+</sup>\n:Cu<sup>2+</sup> + 2 NaOH \u2192 Cu(OH)<sub>2</sub> + 2 Na<sup>+</sup>\n:Cu(OH)<sub>2</sub> \u2192 CuO + H<sub>2</sub>O (endothermic)\n\nConfirmation test for bismuth:\n\n:Bi<sup>3+</sup> + 3 KI (in excess) \u2192 BiI<sub>3</sub> + 3 K<sup>+</sup>\n:BiI<sub>3</sub> + KI \u2192 K[BiI<sub>4</sub>]\n:Bi<sup>3+</sup> + H<sub>2</sub>O (in excess) \u2192 BiO{{su|p=+}} + 2 H<sup>+</sup>\n\nConfirmation test for mercury:\n\n:Hg<sup>2+</sup> + 2 KI (in excess) \u2192 HgI<sub>2</sub> + 2 K<sup>+</sup>\n:HgI<sub>2</sub> + 2 KI \u2192 K<sub>2</sub>[HgI<sub>4</sub>] (red precipitate dissolves)\n:2 Hg<sup>2+</sup> + SnCl<sub>2</sub> \u2192  2 Hg + SnCl<sub>4</sub> (white precipitate turns gray.\n=== 3rd analytical group of cations ===\nThe ''3rd analytical group of cations'' includes ions that form hydroxides which are insoluble even at low concentrations.

These fumes cause a solution of [[potassium iodide]] (KI) and [[starch]] to turn blue.\n\n=== 2nd analytical group of anions ===\nThe ''2nd group of anions'' consist of [[Chloride|Cl<sup>&minus;</sup>]], [[Bromide|Br<sup>&minus;</sup>]], [[Iodide|I<sup>&minus;</sup>]], [[Nitrate|NO{{su|b=3|p=&minus;}}]] and [[Oxalate|C{{su|b=2}}O{{su|b=4|p=2&minus;}}]]. The group reagent for Group 2 anion is concentrated sulphuric acid (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>).\n\nAfter addition of the acid, chlorides, bromides and iodides will form precipitates with [[silver nitrate]]. The precipitates are white, pale yellow, and yellow, respectively. The silver halides formed are completely soluble, partially soluble, or not soluble at all, respectively, in aqueous ammonia solution.\n\nChlorides are confirmed by the ''[[chromyl chloride]] test''. When the salt is heated with K<sub>2</sub>Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> and concentrated H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, red vapours of chromyl chloride (CrO<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>) are produced. Passing this gas through a solution of NaOH produces a yellow solution of [[sodium chromate|Na<sub>2</sub>CrO<sub>4</sub>]]. The acidified solution of Na<sub>2</sub>CrO<sub>4</sub> gives a yellow precipitate with the addition of [[lead(II) acetate|(CH<sub>3</sub>COO)<sub>2</sub>Pb]].\n\nBromides and iodides are confirmed by the ''layer test''. A sodium carbonate extract is made from the solution containing bromide or iodide, and [[chloroform|CHCl<sub>3</sub>]] or [[carbon disulfide|{{chem|CS|2}}]] is added to the solution, which separates into two layers: an orange colour in the {{chem|CHCl|3}} or {{chem|CS|2}} layer indicates the presence of Br<sup>&minus;</sup>, and a violet colour indicates the presence of I<sup>&minus;</sup>.\n\nNitrates give brown fumes with concentrated H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> due to formation of NO<sub>2</sub>. This is intensified upon adding copper turnings. Nitrate ion is confirmed by adding an aqueous solution of the salt to FeSO<sub>4</sub> and pouring concentrated H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> slowly along the sides of the test tube, which produces a brown ring around the walls of the tube, at the junction of the two liquids caused by the formation of {{chem|Fe(NO)|2+}}.<ref>{{cite book\n| title = University Chemistry, Volume 1\n| author = C. Parameshwara Murthy\n| publisher = New Age International\n| year = 2008\n| isbn = 81-224-0742-0\n| page = 133\n}}</ref>\n\nUpon treatment with concentrated sulphuric acid, oxalates yield colourless CO<sub>2</sub> and CO gases. These gases burn with a bluish flame and turn lime water milky. Oxalates also decolourise KMnO<sub>4</sub> and give a white precipitate with CaCl<sub>2</sub>.\n\n=== 3rd analytical group of anions ===\nThe ''3rd group of anions'' consist of [[Sulfates|SO{{su|b=4|p=2&minus;}}]], [[Phosphates|PO{{su|b=4|p=3&minus;}}]] and [[Borates|BO{{su|b=3|p=3&minus;}}]]. They react neither with concentrated nor diluted H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>.\n\n* Sulfates give a white precipitate of BaSO<sub>4</sub> with BaCl<sub>2</sub> which is insoluble in any acid or base.\n* Phosphates give a yellow crystalline precipitate upon addition of HNO<sub>3</sub> and [[ammonium heptamolybdate|ammonium molybdate]].\n* Borates give a green flame characteristic of [[triethyl borate|ethyl borate]] when ignited with concentrated H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> and ethanol.\n\n==Modern techniques==\nQualitative inorganic analysis is now used only as a [[pedagogical]] tool. Modern techniques such as [[atomic absorption spectroscopy]] and [[ICP-MS]] are able to quickly detect the presence and concentrations of elements using a very small amount of sample.\n\n==Sodium carbonate test==\n<!-- If you can find any reliable sources for this section, please add references. -->\nThe sodium carbonate test (not to be confused with sodium carbonate extract test) is used to distinguish between some common metal ions, which are precipitated as their respective carbonates. The test can distinguish between copper (Cu), iron (Fe), and calcium (Ca), zinc (Zn) or lead (Pb). Sodium carbonate solution is added to the salt of the metal. A blue precipitate indicates Cu<sup>2+</sup> ion. A dirty green precipitate indicates Fe<sup>2+</sup> ion. A yellow-brown precipitate indicates Fe<sup>3+</sup> ion. A white precipitate indicates Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Zn<sup>2+</sup>, or Pb<sup>2+</sup> ion. The compounds formed are, respectively, [[copper(II) carbonate]], [[iron(II) carbonate]], [[iron(III) oxide]], [[calcium carbonate]], [[zinc carbonate]], and [[lead(II) carbonate]]. This test is used to precipitate the ion present as almost all carbonates are insoluble. While this test is useful for telling these cations apart, it fails if other ions are present, because most metal carbonates are insoluble and will precipitate. In addition, calcium, zinc, and lead ions all produce white precipitates with carbonate, making it difficult to distinguish between them. Instead of sodium carbonate, [[sodium hydroxide]] may be added, this gives nearly the same colours, except that lead and zinc hydroxides are soluble in excess alkali, and can hence be distinguished from calcium. See qualitative inorganic analysis for the complete sequence of tests used for qualitative cation analysis.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Flame test]]\n* [[Bead test]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n* {{cite book|last=Svehla|first=G.|date=2011|title=Vogel's qualitative inorganic analysis|location=New Delhi|publisher=Pearson|isbn=9788177582321}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Analytical chemistry]]\n", "name_user": "Cincotta1", "label": "safe", "comment": "piped link to correct article precipitation -> precipitation (chemistry)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualitative_inorganic_analysis"}

{"title_page": "Urhannagh", "text_new": "'''Urhannagh''' ({{Irish derived place name|Uar\u00e1nach, meaning 'Abounding in wells or cold springs'}}) is a [[townland]] in the [[civil parishes in Ireland|civil parish]] of [[Templeport]], [[County Cavan]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]. It lies in the Roman Catholic parish of [[Templeport]] and barony of [[Tullyhaw]].\n\n==Geography==\n\nUrhannagh is bounded on the north by [[Clontycarnaghan]]  townland, on the west by [[Munlough North]] townland, on the east by [[Bofealan]] townland and on the south by [[Cavanaquill]] and [[Killynaff]] townlands. Its chief geographical features are a small stream and cow pastures. Urhannagh is traversed by rural lanes. The townland covers 68 statute acres.<ref name=\"IreAtlas\"/>\n\n==History==\n\nThe 1609 Baronial Map depicts the townland as ''Doorawnagh''.<ref>[http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/documents/mpf1-58.pdf National Archives Dublin]</ref><ref>[http://www.templeport.ie/pages/1609-TP-Baronial-Map.html]</ref> A 1630 Inquisition spells it ''Dowerhannagh''. The 1652 Commonwealth Survey spells the name as ''Urgawnagh''. The 1665 Down Survey map depicts it as ''Unshonagh''.<ref>[http://downsurvey.tcd.ie/down-survey-maps.php#bm=Tullaghhagh&c=Cavan]</ref>\n\nWalter Talbot of [[Ballyconnell]] died on 26 June 1625 and his son James Talbot succeeded to the Ballyconnell estate aged just 10 years. An Inquisition held in Cavan on 20 September 1630 found that James Talbot was seized of one poll of ''Dowerhannagh'', along with other lands.<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=WUepqE-K4PAC&pg=PA11-IA1&dq=Derrogeny&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi52JidpKzfAhVCyaQKHb4_BlgQ6AEIMzAC#v=onepage&q=Derrogeny&f=true]</ref> In 1635 James Talbot married Helen Calvert, the daughter of [[George Calvert, 1st Baron Baltimore]] of Maryland, USA. In the Cromwellian [[Act for the Settlement of Ireland 1652]], James Talbot's estate was confiscated because he was a Catholic and he was granted an estate in 1655 at Castle Rubey, County Roscommon instead. He died in 1687. Talbot's land in Urhannagh was distributed as follows-\n\nThe 1652 Commonwealth Survey lists the proprietor as being ''Lieutenant John Blackforde'', who also appears as proprietor of several other Templeport townlands in the same survey. John Blachford was born in 1598 in Ashmore, Dorset, England, the son of Richard and Frances Blachford. He became a merchant in Dorchester, Dorset but fled to France in 1633 when facing a warrant from the Exchequer for not paying customs. He married Mary Renald from Devon and died at [[Lissanover]], County Cavan in 1661 and was buried at St. Orvins in Dublin despite wishing to be buried back in Dorchester. His will was published on 9 January 1665 leaving his son John Blachford as his sole heir. An Inquisition held in Cavan on 21 May 1667 found that his widow Mary Blachford and his heir John were seized of, inter alia, the land of ''Urhunaght alias Unshonagh alias Doorhawnaght''. He had sons John, Thomas, Ambrose and William (who became a Major) and daughters Mary and Frances. Major William Blachford was born in 1658 and died at Lissanover on 28 March 1727.

In the Cromwellian [[Act for the Settlement of Ireland 1652]], James Talbot's estate was confiscated because he was a Catholic and he was granted an estate in 1655 at Castle Rubey, County Roscommon instead. He died in 1687. Talbot's land in Urhannagh was distributed as follows-\n\nThe 1652 Commonwealth Survey lists the proprietor as being ''Lieutenant John Blackforde'', who also appears as proprietor of several other Templeport townlands in the same survey. John Blachford was born in 1598 in Ashmore, Dorset, England, the son of Richard and Frances Blachford. He became a merchant in Dorchester, Dorset but fled to France in 1633 when facing a warrant from the Exchequer for not paying customs. He married Mary Renald from Devon and died at [[Lissanover]], County Cavan in 1661 and was buried at St. Orvins in Dublin despite wishing to be buried back in Dorchester. His will was published on 9 January 1665 leaving his son John Blachford as his sole heir. An Inquisition held in Cavan on 21 May 1667 found that his widow Mary Blachford and his heir John were seized of, inter alia, the land of ''Urhunaght alias Unshonagh alias Doorhawnaght''. He had sons John, Thomas, Ambrose and William (who became a Major) and daughters Mary and Frances. Major William Blachford was born in 1658 and died at Lissanover on 28 March 1727.

Currently the oldest trees in the area are the gnarled \"granny\" pines that are the survivors of generations of [[tree felling|felling]].
