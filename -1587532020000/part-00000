A wealthy settler from [[Virginia]] named [[Richard Pearis]] arrived in South Carolina around 1754 and established relations with the Cherokee. Pearis had a child with a Cherokee woman and received about {{Convert|100,000|acres}} from the Cherokee around 1770. Pearis established a plantation on the [[Reedy River]] called the Great Plains in present-day downtown Greenville. The [[American Revolution]] divided the South Carolina country between the [[Loyalist]]s and [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Patriot]]s. Pearis supported the Loyalists and together with their allies, the Cherokee. After the Cherokee attacked the Patriots, the Patriots retaliated by burning down Pearis' plantation and jailing him in [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]]. Pearis never returned to his plantation but [[Paris Mountain State Park|Paris Mountain]] is named after him.<ref>Whitemire, 76; Archie Vernon Huff, Jr., ''Greenville: The History of the City and County in the South Carolina Piedmont'' (Columbia: University of South Carolina Press, 1995), 13.</ref> The [[Treaty of Dewitt's Corner]] in 1777 ceded almost all Cherokee land, including present-day Greenville, to [[South Carolina]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Treaty of Dewitt's Corner between the Cherokee Nation and South Carolina, 1777|url=http://www.teachingushistory.org/lessons/treatyofdewittscorner.htm|website=teachingushistory.org|publisher=Teaching American History in South Carolina Project|accessdate=October 28, 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[Greenville County, South Carolina|Greenville County]] was created in 1786.

Alston]] came to Greenville County in 1788 and bought {{Convert|400|acre}} and a portion of Pearis' former plantation. In 1797 Alston used his land holdings to establish a village called Pleasantburg where he also built a stately mansion. In 1816, Alston's land was purchased by [[Vardry McBee]], who then leased the Alston mansion for a summer resort, before making the mansion his home from 1835 until his death in 1864. Considered to be the father of Greenville, McBee donated land for many structures such as churches, academies, and a cotton mill. [[Furman University]] was funded by McBee who helped bring the university to Greenville from [[Winnsboro, South Carolina]] in 1851. In 1853 McBee and other Greenville County leaders funded a new railroad called the [[Greenville and Columbia Railroad]]. Greenville boomed to around 1,000 in the 1850s due to the growth of McBee's donations and the attraction of the town as a summer resort for visitors.<ref name=\"The History of Greenville\">{{cite web| title=The History of Greenville| url=http://greenvillesc.gov/DocumentCenter/View/1317| website=greenvillesc.gov| accessdate=October 28, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| title=American History Greenville County, South Carolina| url=http://www.electricscotland.com/history/america/counties/greenville.htm| website=electricscotland.com| publisher=Electric Scotland| accessdate=October 28, 2015}}</ref> In 1831 Pleasantburg was incorporated as Greenville.<ref>{{cite web|title=Government|url=http://greenvillesc.gov/27/Government|website=greenvillesc.gov|publisher=City of Greenville|accessdate=October 31, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Latter 1800s===\n[[File:SwampRabbitGRNV1890s.jpg|thumb|The [[Greenville and Northern Railway]] in the 1890s which was converted into the [[Swamp Rabbit Trail]] in 2010.]]\n\nIn December 1860 Greenville supported a convention to debate the issue of secession for [[South Carolina]].

On December 20, 1860, the South Carolina state convention, along with the Greenville delegation, voted to secede from the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]]. Greenville County provided over 2,000 soldiers to the [[Confederate States Army]]. The town supplied food, clothing, and firearms to the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]]. Greenville saw no action from the war until 1865 when [[Union Army|Union troops]] came through the town looking for [[Jefferson Davis|President Jefferson Davis of the Confederacy]] who had fled south from [[Richmond, Virginia]].

C. General Assembly establishing Greenville, the town, as a city. Construction boomed in the 1870s such as the establishment of a bridge over the [[Reedy River]], new mills on the river and new railroads. [[The Greenville News]] was established in 1874 as Greenville's first daily newspaper. [[Southern Bell]] installed the first telephone lines in the city. The most important infrastructure that came to the city were cotton mills. Prominent cotton mill businesses operated near Greenville making it a cotton mill town. By 1915 Greenville became known as the \"Textile Center of the South.\"<ref name=\"The History of Greenville\"/> From 1915 to 2004, the city hosted an important textile manufacturing trade fair, the [[Southern Textile Exposition]].\n\n===20th century===\n[[File:GreenvilleSC1910.jpg|left|thumb|Main Street around 1910]]\nDuring World War I, Greenville served as a training camp center for Army recruits.

The Mansion House was demolished and replaced with the [[Poinsett Hotel]] in 1925.<ref name=\"The History of Greenville\"/> The [[Great Depression]] hurt the economy of Greenville forcing mills to lay off workers. [[Furman University]] and the Greenville Women's College also struggled in the crippling economy forcing them to merge in 1933. The [[Textile workers strike (1934)|Textile Workers Strike of 1934]] caused such an uproar in the city and surrounding mill towns that the [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]] had to subdue the chaos. The [[New Deal]] established [[Sirrine Stadium]] and a new [[Greenville Technical Charter High School|Greenville High School]]. The [[Donaldson Air Force Base|Greenville Army Air Base]] was established in 1942 during World War II contributing to the further growth of Greenville.<ref name=\"The History of Greenville\"/>\n\nOn February 16, 1947, [[The lynching of Willie Earle|Willie Earle]], a Black man accused of stabbing a cab driver, was taken from his jail cell by a mob of mostly taxi drivers and [[Lynching|murdered]].

[[Furman University]] doubled its student population and moved to a new location. Higher education facilities such as [[Bob Jones University]] in 1947 and [[Greenville Technical College]] in 1962 were established in Greenville. The [[Greenville\u2013Spartanburg International Airport]] was established in nearby [[Greer, South Carolina|Greer]] in 1962. The economy of Greenville finally waned in the 1970s leaving a void in downtown Greenville due to the flight of many retailers. Mayor [[Max Heller]] then revitalized downtown Greenville with the [[Greenville County Museum of Art]] and the Hughes Main Library. Main Street was then converted into a two-lane road lined with trees and sidewalks. With a 1978 federal grant, a convention center and hotel were built, bringing business back to the area.<ref>{{cite web|title=Max Heller Collection: Biography|url=http://library.furman.edu/specialcollections/southcarolina/heller_biography.htm|website=furman.edu|publisher=Furman|accessdate=October 29, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151121090106/http://library.furman.edu/specialcollections/southcarolina/heller_biography.htm|archive-date=November 21, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nGreenville is located at {{Coord|34|50|40|N|82|23|8|W|type:city}} (34.844313, \u221282.385428),<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web| url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html| publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]| accessdate=2011-04-23| date=2011-02-12| title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> roughly equidistant between [[Atlanta]] ({{Convert|145|mi|disp=sqbr}} southwest), and [[Charlotte, North Carolina]] ({{convert|100|mi|disp=sqbr}} northeast).

A wealthy settler from [[Virginia]] named [[Richard Pearis]] arrived in South Carolina around 1754 and established relations with the Cherokee. Pearis had a child with a Cherokee woman and received about {{Convert|100,000|acres}} from the Cherokee around 1770. Pearis established a plantation on the [[Reedy River]] called the Great Plains in present-day downtown Greenville. The [[American Revolution]] divided the South Carolina country between the [[Loyalist]]s and [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Patriot]]s. Pearis supported the Loyalists and together with their allies, the Cherokee. After the Cherokee attacked the Patriots, the Patriots retaliated by burning down Pearis' plantation and jailing him in [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]]. Pearis never returned to his plantation but [[Paris Mountain State Park|Paris Mountain]] is named after him.<ref>Whitemire, 76; Archie Vernon Huff, Jr., ''Greenville: The History of the City and County in the South Carolina Piedmont'' (Columbia: University of South Carolina Press, 1995), 13.</ref> The [[Treaty of Dewitt's Corner]] in 1777 ceded almost all Cherokee land, including present-day Greenville, to [[South Carolina]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Treaty of Dewitt's Corner between the Cherokee Nation and South Carolina, 1777|url=http://www.teachingushistory.org/lessons/treatyofdewittscorner.htm|website=teachingushistory.org|publisher=Teaching American History in South Carolina Project|accessdate=October 28, 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[Greenville County, South Carolina|Greenville County]] was created in 1786.

Alston]] came to Greenville County in 1788 and bought {{Convert|400|acre}} and a portion of Pearis' former plantation. In 1797 Alston used his land holdings to establish a village called Pleasantburg where he also built a stately mansion. In 1816, Alston's land was purchased by [[Vardry McBee]], who then leased the Alston mansion for a summer resort, before making the mansion his home from 1835 until his death in 1864. Considered to be the father of Greenville, McBee donated land for many structures such as churches, academies, and a cotton mill. [[Furman University]] was funded by McBee who helped bring the university to Greenville from [[Winnsboro, South Carolina]] in 1851. In 1853 McBee and other Greenville County leaders funded a new railroad called the [[Greenville and Columbia Railroad]]. Greenville boomed to around 1,000 in the 1850s due to the growth of McBee's donations and the attraction of the town as a summer resort for visitors.<ref name=\"The History of Greenville\">{{cite web| title=The History of Greenville| url=http://greenvillesc.gov/DocumentCenter/View/1317| website=greenvillesc.gov| accessdate=October 28, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| title=American History Greenville County, South Carolina| url=http://www.electricscotland.com/history/america/counties/greenville.htm| website=electricscotland.com| publisher=Electric Scotland| accessdate=October 28, 2015}}</ref> In 1831 Pleasantburg was incorporated as Greenville.<ref>{{cite web|title=Government|url=http://greenvillesc.gov/27/Government|website=greenvillesc.gov|publisher=City of Greenville|accessdate=October 31, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Latter 1800s===\n[[File:SwampRabbitGRNV1890s.jpg|thumb|The [[Greenville and Northern Railway]] in the 1890s which was converted into the [[Swamp Rabbit Trail]] in 2010.]]\n\nIn December 1860 Greenville supported a convention to debate the issue of secession for [[South Carolina]].

On December 20, 1860, the South Carolina state convention, along with the Greenville delegation, voted to secede from the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]]. Greenville County provided over 2,000 soldiers to the [[Confederate States Army]]. The town supplied food, clothing, and firearms to the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]]. Greenville saw no action from the war until 1865 when [[Union Army|Union troops]] came through the town looking for [[Jefferson Davis|President Jefferson Davis of the Confederacy]] who had fled south from [[Richmond, Virginia]].

C. General Assembly establishing Greenville, the town, as a city. Construction boomed in the 1870s such as the establishment of a bridge over the [[Reedy River]], new mills on the river and new railroads. [[The Greenville News]] was established in 1874 as Greenville's first daily newspaper. [[Southern Bell]] installed the first telephone lines in the city. The most important infrastructure that came to the city were cotton mills. Prominent cotton mill businesses operated near Greenville making it a cotton mill town. By 1915 Greenville became known as the \"Textile Center of the South.\"<ref name=\"The History of Greenville\"/> From 1915 to 2004, the city hosted an important textile manufacturing trade fair, the [[Southern Textile Exposition]].\n\n===20th century===\n[[File:GreenvilleSC1910.jpg|left|thumb|Main Street around 1910]]\nDuring World War I, Greenville served as a training camp center for Army recruits.

The Mansion House was demolished and replaced with the [[Poinsett Hotel]] in 1925.<ref name=\"The History of Greenville\"/> The [[Great Depression]] hurt the economy of Greenville forcing mills to lay off workers. Furman University and the Greenville Women's College also struggled in the crippling economy forcing them to merge in 1933. The [[Textile workers strike (1934)|Textile Workers Strike of 1934]] caused such an uproar in the city and surrounding mill towns that the [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]] had to subdue the chaos. The [[New Deal]] established [[Sirrine Stadium]] and a new [[Greenville Technical Charter High School|Greenville High School]].

Furman University doubled its student population and moved to a new location. Higher education facilities such as [[Bob Jones University]] in 1947 and [[Greenville Technical College]] in 1962 were established in Greenville. The [[Greenville\u2013Spartanburg International Airport]] was established in nearby [[Greer, South Carolina|Greer]] in 1962. The economy of Greenville finally waned in the 1970s leaving a void in downtown Greenville due to the flight of many retailers. Mayor [[Max Heller]] then revitalized downtown Greenville with the [[Greenville County Museum of Art]] and the Hughes Main Library. Main Street was then converted into a two-lane road lined with trees and sidewalks.

The band included lead vocalist Mick Hadley, lead guitarist Barry Lyde (later known as [[Lobby Loyde]]), rhythm guitarists Paul Steffen (1964\u201365) and Fred Pickard (1965-66), bassist Bob Dames, and drummers Adrian \"Red\" Redmond (1964\u201366) and Tony Cahill (1966-67). The group issued an extended play, ''The Sound of the Purple Hearts'' (1966), and several singles, including \"Long-legged Baby\" (1965) and \"Early in the Morning\" (1966). They disbanded early in 1967.\n\n== History ==\n\nPurple Hearts were formed in Brisbane in 1964 with the original line-up of Bob Dames on bass guitar (ex-Impacts), Mick Hadley on lead vocals (ex-Impacts), [[Lobby Loyde|Barry Lyde]] on lead guitar (ex-Stilettos), Fred Pickard on rhythm guitar and Adrian \"Red\" Redmond on drums.<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/> Dames and Hadley had both migrated from London in the previous year or so and formed the Impacts, an R&B group, with Scottish-born Pickard and two locals, Lyde and Redmond.<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/> Lyde had joined the Stilletos in 1963 to play [[the Shadows]]-styled instrumentals and left near the end of the following year to join the Impacts.<ref name=\"Donovan\"/><ref name=\"McFarlane LL\"/>\n\nBrisbane, traditionally the most conservative of Australia's state capitals, has fostered some of this country's most anarchistic rock bands from the Purple Hearts to [[The Saints (Australian band)|the Saints]]. The Purple Hearts were tough, arrogant and pioneering and Lyde, as Lobby Loyde, is acknowledged as Australia's first true rock guitar hero \u2013 busy blowing up speaker boxes before high volume and feed-back became rock staples.<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/><ref name=\"McFarlane LL\"/><ref name=\"Kimball\"/> When the Impacts performed in Melbourne, they found another band of the same name, so Dames provided their new name \u2013 Purple Hearts \u2013 for the illicit [[amphetamine]] pills favoured by the [[Mod (subculture)|mod]] subculture.<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/><ref name=\"Nimmervoll\"/> The group's debut single, \"Long-legged Baby\", was a cover version of [[Graham Bond]]'s track.<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/> It was \"a rough recording made at a radio station studio\" and issued \"on the obscure, independent label Soundtrack\" in 1965.<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/><ref name=\"Nimmervoll\"/>\n\nThey signed with [[Sunshine Records (Australia)|Sunshine Records]] (home to [[Normie Rowe]]) and reissued \"Long-legged Baby\" in October 1965, which reached the top&nbsp;10 in Brisbane.<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/> The group were uncompromising in their attitude toward recording; consequently, their handful of singles are enduring artefacts of their style, which blended blues, R&B and prototype [[psychedelic rock]], a style made even tougher by the regional influences. The group relocated to Sydney, where Redmond was replaced by Tony Cahill on drums.<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/>\n\nEarly in 1966 they moved base to Melbourne, where they \"ruled over the city's discotheque circuit.\"<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/> According to music journalist, [[Ed Nimmervoll]], \"they were making an impression in their own right, not because their music was the latest thing. The Purple Hearts' Mick Hadley was an amazing frontman, riveting audiences with his wild-eyed performances. The rest of the band were quickly considered the best in their field, especially guitarist Barry Lyde.\"<ref name=\"Nimmervoll\"/> In February of that year they issued their second single, \"Of Hopes and Dreams and Tombstones\".<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/> It was a cover version of the United States singer, Jimmy Fraser<!-- Not football player -->'s 1965 single.<ref name=\"Nuttall 1\"/>\n\nThey enjoyed minor chart success with their next single \"Early in the Morning\" (August 1966) \u2013 a cover of a 1947 field recording of a traditional prison song by [[Alan Lomax]], released in 1959 \u2013 which peaked at No.&nbsp;9 in Melbourne and No.&nbsp;13 in Brisbane.<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/><ref name=\"Nuttall 2\"/> Soon after they compiled their earlier singles, \"Long-legged Baby\" and \"Of Hopes and Dreams and Tombstones\" on a four-track extended play, ''The Sound of the Purple Hearts'', on the Sunshine label.<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/> They made several appearances on a pop TV series, ''[[The Go!!

The band included lead vocalist Mick Hadley, lead guitarist Barry Lyde (later known as [[Lobby Loyde]]), rhythm guitarists Paul Steffen (1964\u201365) and Fred Pickard (1965-66), bassist Bob Dames, and drummers Adrian \"Red\" Redmond (1964\u201366) and Tony Cahill (1966-67). The group issued an extended play, ''The Sound of the Purple Hearts'' (1966), and several singles, including \"Long-legged Baby\" (1965) and \"Early in the Morning\" (1966). They disbanded early in 1967.\n\n== History ==\n\nPurple Hearts were formed in Brisbane in 1964 with the original line-up of Bob Dames on bass guitar (ex-Impacts), Mick Hadley on lead vocals (ex-Impacts), [[Lobby Loyde|Barry Lyde]] on lead guitar (ex-Stilettos), Fred Pickard on rhythm guitar and Adrian \"Red\" Redmond on drums.<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/> Dames and Hadley had both migrated from London in the previous year or so and formed the Impacts, an R&B group, with Scottish-born Pickard and two locals, Lyde and Redmond.<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/> Lyde had joined the Stilletos in 1963 to play [[the Shadows]]-styled instrumentals and left near the end of the following year to join the Impacts.<ref name=\"Donovan\"/><ref name=\"McFarlane LL\"/>\n\nBrisbane, traditionally the most conservative of Australia's state capitals, has fostered some of this country's most anarchistic rock bands from the Purple Hearts to [[The Saints (Australian band)|the Saints]]. The Purple Hearts were tough, arrogant and pioneering and Lyde, as Lobby Loyde, is acknowledged as Australia's first true rock guitar hero \u2013 busy blowing up speaker boxes before high volume and feed-back became rock staples.<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/><ref name=\"McFarlane LL\"/><ref name=\"Kimball\"/> When the Impacts performed in Melbourne, they found another band of the same name, so Dames provided their new name \u2013 Purple Hearts \u2013 for the illicit [[amphetamine]] pills favoured by the [[Mod (subculture)|mod]] subculture.<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/><ref name=\"Nimmervoll\"/> The group's debut single, \"Long-legged Baby\", was a cover version of [[Graham Bond]]'s track.<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/> It was \"a rough recording made at a radio station studio\" and issued \"on the obscure, independent label Soundtrack\" in 1965.<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/><ref name=\"Nimmervoll\"/>\n\nThey signed with [[Sunshine Records (Australia)|Sunshine Records]] (home to [[Normie Rowe]]) and reissued \"Long-legged Baby\" in October 1965, which reached the top&nbsp;10 in Brisbane.<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/> The group were uncompromising in their attitude toward recording; consequently, their handful of singles are enduring artefacts of their style, which blended blues, R&B and prototype [[psychedelic rock]], a style made even tougher by the regional influences. The group relocated to Sydney where Redmond was replaced by Tony Cahill on drums.<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/>\n\nEarly in 1966 they moved base to Melbourne, where they \"ruled over the city's discotheque circuit.\"<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/> According to music journalist, [[Ed Nimmervoll]], \"they were making an impression in their own right, not because their music was the latest thing. The Purple Hearts' Mick Hadley was an amazing frontman, riveting audiences with his wild-eyed performances. The rest of the band were quickly considered the best in their field, especially guitarist Barry Lyde.\"<ref name=\"Nimmervoll\"/> In February of that year they issued their second single, \"Of Hopes and Dreams and Tombstones\".<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/> It was a cover version of the United States singer, Jimmy Fraser<!-- Not football player -->'s 1965 single.<ref name=\"Nuttall 1\"/>\n\nThey enjoyed minor chart success with their next single \"Early in the Morning\" (August 1966) \u2013 a cover of a 1947 field recording of a traditional prison song by [[Alan Lomax]], released in 1959 \u2013 which peaked at No.&nbsp;9 in Melbourne and No.&nbsp;13 in Brisbane.<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/><ref name=\"Nuttall 2\"/> Soon after they compiled their earlier singles, \"Long-legged Baby\" and \"Of Hopes and Dreams and Tombstones\" on a four-track extended play, ''The Sound of the Purple Hearts'', on the Sunshine label.<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/> They made several appearances on a pop TV series, ''[[The Go!! Show]]''. On 23 January 1967 the group issued a press release stating \"they had ceased to progress musically, were becoming stagnant and, therefore, had decided to split.\"<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/> Lyde, under the name Lobby Loyde, had already joined [[Wild Cherries]] in that month, alongside [[Keith Barber (drummer)|Keith Barber]] on drums, Peter Eddey on bass guitar, Les Gilbert on organ and [[Dan Robinson (singer)|Danny Robinson]] on vocals.<ref name=\"McFarlane WC\"/> The other four members of Purple Hearts continued for another month and released two more singles, \"You Can't Sit Down\" (January 1967) and \"Chicago\" (posthumously in April).<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/><ref name=\"Nimmervoll\"/> Cahill travelled to the United Kingdom where he joined [[the Easybeats]] on drums.<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/>\n\nFollowing the split of the Purple Hearts, Hadley spent several months in the UK.
