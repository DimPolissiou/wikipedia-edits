He is best known for his service as an officer in the [[Continental Army]] during the [[American Revolutionary War]]. He acted as leader of the [[Culper Ring]] during the war, a celebrated network of spies in New York where major British forces were based. He also led a successful raid across [[Long Island]] that culminated in the [[Battle of Fort St. George]]. Following the war, Tallmadge was elected to the United States House of Representatives as a member of the [[Federalist Party]].\n\n==Early life==\nTallmadge was born February 25, 1754, the son of Susannah Smith (1729\u20131768) and Rev.

Benedict Arnold's British contact [[John Andr\u00e9]] was caught and taken to North Castle, where commander Colonel Jameson ordered lieutenant Allen to take the incriminating documents found with Andr\u00e9 to their commander Benedict Arnold at West Point. Tallmadge suspected Andr\u00e9 to be a spy and Benedict Arnold to be his accomplice, and he tried to have Jameson reverse his orders. He was unsuccessful, but did convince Jameson to send a rider and take Andre to Salem, eight miles east of the Hudson River and to send the documents to George Washington. Allen still reported to Benedict Arnold with Jameson's note outlining the events. Later, Jameson was chastised by Washington for warning Arnold and allowing his escape. Andr\u00e9 was placed in Tallmadge's custody awaiting execution.\n\nOn November 21, 1780, Tallmadge and his dragoons rowed across Long Island Sound from [[Fairfield, Connecticut]] to [[Cedar Beach (Brookhaven, New York)|Cedar Beach]] in [[Mount Sinai, New York]]. The next day, they proceeded to the south shore where they captured and burned down [[Manor St. George]]. On their march back to Mt. Sinai, Tallmadge stopped in [[Coram, New York]] and ordered the burning of 300 tons of hay which the British had been stockpiling for the winter. George Washington, on hearing the news, sent the following letter to Tallmadge:\n<blockquote>I have received with much pleasure the report of your successful enterprise upon fort St. George, and was pleased with the destruction of the hay at Coram, which must be severely felt by the enemy at this time.

The oldest known [[Japantown]] featuring a Japanese cemetery is in [[Phra Nakhon Si Ayutthaya District|Ayutthaya]], [[Thailand]], which was established in the 14th to 18th century. The oldest known Japanese national recorded by name and buried outside Japan is the early explorer [[Yamada Nagamasa]]. \n\nWars, particularly [[World War II]], accounted for a large portion of Japanese burial places outside Japan. The cemetery of the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] in [[Malta]], various burial places of [[Japanese prisoners of war in the Soviet Union|Japanese prisoners of war]] in [[Siberia]], and [[Pacific War]] sites including the [[Nanp\u014d Islands]], [[Philippines|the Philippines]], [[New Guinea]], and other [[Pacific Islands]] feature multiple Japanese cemeteries, cenotaphs, and [[Cadaver|remains]] despite soldiers' organizations and/or Japanese government efforts to recover them.\n\nVictims of the United States' internment of its citizens of Japanese ancestry are prevalent in the Western United States.\n\n== Location, Name of Cemetery, Cenotaph and Tomb ==\n{{Expand section|date=February 2017}}\n\n=== Asia ===\n\n==== Bhutan ====\n* [[Paro, Bhutan|Paro]] - Burial place with the [[pagoda]] of botanist Keiji Nishioka ({{Nihongo2|[[:ja:\u897f\u5ca1\u4eac\u6cbb|\u897f\u5ca1\u4eac\u6cbb]]}})\n\n==== Cambodia ====\n* [[Phnom Penh]] - Cenotaph, Haruyuki Takada ({{Nihongo2|[[:ja:\u9ad8\u7530\u6674\u884c|\u9ad8\u7530 \u6674\u884c]]}}), police, [[Line of duty death]] participate in [[United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia]] \u2013 [[Phnom Penh]]\n* [[Siem Reap Province]] - Tomb, [[Taizo Ichinose]]\n* [[Kampong Thom City]], [[Kampong Thom Province]] - ''Atsu Elementary and junior high school'' and monument ''A'' in a garden bearing the name [[Atsuhito Nakata]].

MacDonald]] claiming that [[evolutionary psychology]] provides the motivations behind [[Jewish]] group behavior and [[Jewish culture|culture]].

He argues that Judaism fosters in Jews a series of marked genetic traits, including above-average verbal intelligence and a strong tendency toward collectivist behavior. MacDonald also notes a negative shift in tone from the first book to the third, and attributes it to having learned more, read more, and \"changed greatly\" in that time. MacDonald's trilogy has been described as significant for \"its potential to forge a standardized anti-Semitic critique in the far right.\"<ref name=\"MICHAEL\">[[George Michael (professor)|George Michael]], Professor Kevin MacDonald's critique of Judaism: legitimate scholarship or the intellectualization of anti-semitism?, ''Journal of Church and State'' September 22, 2006 [http://www.kevinmacdonald.net/JC&S48-2006.pdf]</ref>\n\nThe trilogy was followed by additional writings on the topic published by the ''[[Occidental Quarterly]]'', a periodical MacDonald currently edits:\n*''Understanding Jewish Influence: A Study in Ethnic Activism''<ref name=\"macdonald_2004\">MacDonald, K.

He examines evidence from Jewish history, culture, and genetics supporting his thesis, arguing that Judaism is based on a strong -- and possibly genetically based -- predisposition to [[ethnocentrism]] characteristic of Middle Eastern cultures generally but exacerbated as a result of selective effects resulting from Jewish cultural practices. He considers the use of the complex and extensive Jewish scriptures and the high prestige of [[Rabbinic]] learning as [[eugenics|eugenic]] mechanisms for promoting Jewish verbal intelligence and [[dexterity]].{{cn|date=September 2017}}{{or|date=September 2017}}\n\n===''Separation and Its Discontents'' (1998)===\n\nDeveloping his work in ''A People that Shall Dwell Alone'', MacDonald examines antisemitism as a test case for an evolutionary analysis of ethnic conflict in general, applying social identity theory to three critical periods of institutionalized antisemitism: the Roman Empire in the fourth century; the [[Spanish Inquisition|Iberian inquisitions from the fourteenth century]]; and [[Nazi Germany|German Nazism]] in the period 1933-45. He argues that antisemitism can be analysed as a consequence of resource competition between groups in which each group is rationally pursuing its own interests, rather than as a manifestation of irrational malice by non-Jewish out-groups, and asserts that Jews, particularly strongly identified Jews, will be relatively prone to self-deception by ignoring or rationalizing negative information about themselves and their in-group. Finally, he discusses whether Judaism has ceased to be an evolutionary strategy because of the current levels of intermarriage among some groups of diaspora Jews, arguing that it has not ceased to be so and that it continues to flourish.{{cn|date=September 2017}}{{or|date=September 2017}}\n\n===''The Culture of Critique'' (1998)===\n\nMacDonald examines [[Franz Boas#Later career: academic anthropology|Boasian anthropology]], [[political radicalism]], [[psychoanalysis]], the [[Frankfurt School]], and [[The New York Intellectuals]], arguing that Jews dominated these intellectual movements and that a strong sense of Jewish identity was characteristic of the great majority of the individuals in these movements. He argues that these individuals were pursuing a Jewish ethnic agenda in establishing and participating in these movements, while writing that the Jewish community does not constitute a unified movement and that only a small and elite minority of that community participated in these movements.{{cn|date=September 2017}}{{or|date=September 2017}}\n\nHe claims Jewish efforts to shape [[Immigration to the United States|United States immigration policy]] were in opposition to what he sees as the interests of the peoples of non-Jewish European descent, particularly the peoples of Northern and Western Europe. He concludes the book by claiming that intellectual movements he examines are movements that are either \"Jewish\" by nature or Jewish-controlled, with baleful results: \"the result has been a widening gulf between the cultural successes of Jews and Gentiles and a disaster for society as a whole.\"{{cn|date=September 2017}}{{or|date=September 2017}}\n\nDescribing the evolution of his thinking over the course of his writing the trilogy, MacDonald says in his preface to the 2002 paperback edition of ''The Culture of Critique'':\n<blockquote>I think there is a noticeable shift in my tone from the first book to the third simply because (I'd like to think) I knew a lot more and had read a lot more. People often say after reading the first book that they think I really admire Jews, but they are unlikely to say that about the last two and especially about ''CofC''. That is because by the time I wrote ''CofC'' I had changed greatly from the person who wrote the first book.<ref>[http://www.csulb.edu/~kmacd/books-Preface.html preface to the paperback edition of The Culture of Critique] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061006031740/http://www.csulb.edu/~kmacd/books-Preface.html |date=2006-10-06 }}</ref></blockquote>\n\n===''Understanding Jewish Influence'' (2004)===\n\nWith introduction by [[white nationalism|white nationalist]] political writer [[Samuel T.

According to the ADL, MacDonald's views on Jews mimic those of antisemites from the late 19th and early 20th centuries.\n\n===Academic response===\n\nIn a letter to ''Slate'' magazine, [[Harvard University]] psychology professor [[Steven Pinker]] wrote:\n\n<blockquote>The suggestion that scholars \"can't ignore bad ideas\" is a nonstarter. In science there are a thousand bad ideas for every good one. \"Doing battle\" against all of them is not an option for mere mortals, and doing battle against some of them is a tacit acknowledgment that those have enough merit to exceed the onerous threshold of attention-worthiness. MacDonald's ideas, as presented in summaries that would serve as a basis for further examination, do not pass that threshold, for many reasons: <br>\n\n1. By stating that Jews promulgate scientific hypotheses because they are Jewish, he is engaging in ''[[ad hominem]]'' argumentation that is outside the bounds of normal scientific discourse and an obvious waste of time to engage. MacDonald has already announced that I will reject his ideas because I am Jewish, so what's the point of replying to them? <br>\n\n2. MacDonald's main axioms &ndash; group selection of behavioral adaptations, and behaviorally relevant genetic cohesiveness of ethnic groups &ndash; are opposed by powerful bodies of data and theory, which Tooby, Cosmides, and many other evolutionary psychologists have written about in detail. Of course any assumption can be questioned, but there are no signs that MacDonald has taken on the burden of proof of showing that the majority view is wrong. <br>\n\n3. MacDonald's various theses, even if worthy of scientific debate individually, collectively add up to a consistently invidious portrayal of Jews, couched in value-laden, disparaging language. It is impossible to avoid the impression that this is not an ordinary scientific hypothesis. <br>\n\n4. The argument, as presented in the summaries, fails two basic tests of scientific credibility: a control group (in this case, other minority ethnic groups), and a comparison with alternative hypotheses (such as [[Thomas Sowell]]'s convincing analysis of \"middlemen minorities\" such as the Jews, presented in his magisterial study of migration, race, conquest, and culture).<ref name=\"fringe\">[http://www.cep.ucsb.edu/slatedialog.html Slate Magazine Dialogue On: How To Deal With Fringe Academics]</ref>\n</blockquote> Pinker closed by commenting that he had \"not plowed through MacDonald's trilogy and therefore run the complementary risks of being unfair to his arguments, and of not refuting them resoundingly enough\".<ref name=\"fringe\" />\n\nA paper by David Lieberman, a Holocaust researcher at [[Brandeis University]], alleges that MacDonald has distorted evidence and chosen evidence selectively for rhetorical purposes.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20010609074310/http://www2.h-net.msu.edu/~antis/papers/dl/macdonald_schatz_01.html MacDonald - Schatz: 1 of 3<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n[[John Tooby]], past president of the [[Human Behavior and Evolution Society]] and a professor of [[anthropology]] at the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]], insists that MacDonald is not an evolutionary psychologist, and that he advocates a generally discredited view of natural selection.

According to Gilman, \"MacDonald recasts all of the hoary old myths about Jewish psychological difference and its presumed link to Jewish superior intelligence in contemporary sociobiological garb\". Gilman also charges that \"MacDonald manipulates his sources rather shamelessly\", including Gilman's own work. Gilman concludes that MacDonald's book \"is the most recent chapter in the continued myth-building concerning Jewish superior intelligence and achievement. It is, like the numerous earlier works, of interest in how positive images turn into the means by which Jewish difference is stressed and Jewish acculturation is shown to be pathological\".<ref name=Gilman>{{cite journal |last1=Gilman |first1=Sander L. |authorlink1=Sander Gilman |title=Review of A People That Shall Dwell Alone: Judaism as a Group Evolutionary Strategy |journal=The Jewish Quarterly Review |date=1995 |volume=86 |issue=1/2 |pages=198\u2013201 |doi=10.2307/1454833 |jstor=1454833 }}</ref>\n\nReviewing Macdonald's ''A People That Shall Dwell Alone'' in the ''[[Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion]]'', Eugen Schoenfeld, Professor Emeritus of Sociology at [[Georgia State University]], commented that \"the book is controversial, not only because of its theoretical approach, but also, and perhaps primarily, because of sloppy scholarship\". Schoenfeld writes that Macdonald \"selects historical incidents that can be used to support his thesis and conveniently omits others that challenge his thesis\". Schoenfeld points to what he sees as Macdonald's \"unfamiliarity with both the sociological frame of reference and historical knowledge\", and as an example, notes that Macdonald's comparison of Jewish collectivism during the biblical period with eighteenth- and nineteenth-century English individualism \"indicates a total ignorance of the impact of industrialization on Western societies\".<ref name=\"Eugen\">Eugen Schoenfeld.

He examines evidence from Jewish history, culture, and genetics supporting his thesis, arguing that Judaism is based on a strong -- and possibly genetically based -- predisposition to [[ethnocentrism]] characteristic of Middle Eastern cultures generally but exacerbated as a result of selective effects resulting from Jewish cultural practices. He considers the use of the complex and extensive Jewish scriptures and the high prestige of [[Rabbinic]] learning as [[eugenics|eugenic]] mechanisms for promoting Jewish verbal intelligence and [[dexterity]].{{cn|date=September 2017}}{{or|date=September 2017}}\n\n===''Separation and Its Discontents'' (1998)===\n\nDeveloping his work in ''A People that Shall Dwell Alone'', MacDonald examines antisemitism as a test case for an evolutionary analysis of ethnic conflict in general, applying social identity theory to three critical periods of institutionalized antisemitism: the Roman Empire in the fourth century; the [[Spanish Inquisition|Iberian inquisitions from the fourteenth century]]; and [[Nazi Germany|German Nazism]] in the period 1933-45. He argues that antisemitism can be analysed as a consequence of resource competition between groups in which each group is rationally pursuing its own interests, rather than as a manifestation of irrational malice by non-Jewish out-groups, and asserts that Jews, particularly strongly identified Jews, will be relatively prone to self-deception by ignoring or rationalizing negative information about themselves and their in-group. Finally, he discusses whether Judaism has ceased to be an evolutionary strategy because of the current levels of intermarriage among some groups of diaspora Jews, arguing that it has not ceased to be so and that it continues to flourish.{{cn|date=September 2017}}{{or|date=September 2017}}\n\n===''The Culture of Critique'' (1998)===\n\nMacDonald examines [[Franz Boas#Later career: academic anthropology|Boasian anthropology]], [[political radicalism]], [[psychoanalysis]], the [[Frankfurt School]], and [[The New York Intellectuals]], arguing that Jews dominated these intellectual movements and that a strong sense of Jewish identity was characteristic of the great majority of the individuals in these movements.

It is impossible to avoid the impression that this is not an ordinary scientific hypothesis. <br>\n\n4. The argument, as presented in the summaries, fails two basic tests of scientific credibility: a control group (in this case, other minority ethnic groups), and a comparison with alternative hypotheses (such as [[Thomas Sowell]]'s convincing analysis of \"middlemen minorities\" such as the Jews, presented in his magisterial study of migration, race, conquest, and culture).<ref name=\"fringe\">[http://www.cep.ucsb.edu/slatedialog.html Slate Magazine Dialogue On: How To Deal With Fringe Academics]</ref>\n</blockquote> Pinker closed by commenting that he had \"not plowed through MacDonald's trilogy and therefore run the complementary risks of being unfair to his arguments, and of not refuting them resoundingly enough\".<ref name=\"fringe\" />\n\nA paper by David Lieberman, a Holocaust researcher at [[Brandeis University]], alleges that MacDonald has distorted evidence and chosen evidence selectively for rhetorical purposes.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20010609074310/http://www2.h-net.msu.edu/~antis/papers/dl/macdonald_schatz_01.html MacDonald - Schatz: 1 of 3<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n[[John Tooby]], past president of the [[Human Behavior and Evolution Society]] and a professor of [[anthropology]] at the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]], insists that MacDonald is not an evolutionary psychologist, and that he advocates a generally discredited view of natural selection.

According to Gilman, \"MacDonald recasts all of the hoary old myths about Jewish psychological difference and its presumed link to Jewish superior intelligence in contemporary sociobiological garb\". Gilman also charges that \"MacDonald manipulates his sources rather shamelessly\", including Gilman's own work. Gilman concludes that MacDonald's book \"is the most recent chapter in the continued myth-building concerning Jewish superior intelligence and achievement.

However, little is known of the history of the town before the construction of [[Ruthin Castle]] was started in 1277 by [[Dafydd ap Gruffydd|Dafydd]], the brother of prince [[Llywelyn ap Gruffudd]]. However, he forfeited the castle when he rebelled against [[Edward I of England|King Edward I]] with his brother; Edward's queen, [[Eleanor of Castile|Eleanor]], was in residence in 1281. The [[Marcher Lord]], [[Baron Grey de Ruthyn|Reginald de Grey]], Justiciar of [[Chester, England|Chester]], was given the ''Cantref'' (an administrative district) of Deffrencloyt (Dyffryn Clwyd, the Welsh for ''Vale of Clwyd''), and his family ran the area for the next 226 years. The [[Reginald Grey, 3rd Baron Grey de Ruthyn|third Baron de Grey]]'s land dispute with [[Owain Glynd\u0175r]] triggered Glynd\u0175r's rebellion against [[Henry IV of England|King Henry IV]], which began on 16 September 1400, when Glynd\u0175r burned Ruthin to the ground, reputedly leaving only the castle and a few other buildings standing.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.castlewales.com/ruthin.html |title=Ruthin castle |accessdate=8 June 2007|last=Northall |first=John }}</ref>\n\nThe Lord de Grey established a [[Collegiate and Parochial Church of St Peter, Ruthin|Collegiate Church]] in 1310. Now the Collegiate and Parish Church of St Peter, it dominates the Ruthin skyline. It has a double nave and boasts two medieval carved roofs. These days it is known for its musical tradition.

It was rebuilt in the 19th century as a country house, which has now been turned into the ''Ruthin Castle Hotel''. From 1826 until 1921 the castle was the home of the Cornwallis-West family, members of Victorian and Edwardian high society.\n\nIn its 18th-century heyday as a town on [[Drovers' road|drovers' routes]] from Wales into England, Ruthin was reputed to have \"a pub for every week of the year\". By 2007, however, there were only eleven pubs in the town. The public records of 23 October 1891 show 31 such establishments serving a population of 3,186; most have been converted into housing or shops. [[The Ruthin Union Workhouse]] was built in 1834.\n\nThe first copies of the Welsh [[national anthem]], ''[[Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau]]'', were printed in what is now the ''[[Siop Nain]]'' tea and gift shop on Well Street.\n\nIn 1863 the [[Denbigh, Ruthin and Corwen Railway]], which linked in Denbigh with the [[Vale of Clwyd Railway]] (later part of the [[London and North Western Railway]], the [[London, Midland and Scottish Railway]], and [[British Rail]]) reached the town.

Its Grade II listed building was built about 1830 as the home of local solicitor, before becoming in 1898 ''Ruthin County School for Girls''. (The town's boys travelled five miles by train to Denbigh High School.) The school went co-educational in 1938, with feeder junior schools up to around six miles away. Building work in the 1950s and the early 1970s increased the number of pupils from 700 to 1000 in a few years, as the minimum school-leaving age rose from 15 to 16). In 2001\u20132002 the listed building became the Sixth Form Centre. The school's sports facilities, including the swimming pool, are used as the town's Leisure Centre. It also features a theatre and arts complex, ''Theatr John Ambrose'', named after a headmaster of the school in the 1980s and 1990s.

The County Council bought the buildings in 1926 and used part of them for offices, the county archives, and the town library. During the [[Second World War]] the prison buildings were used as a munitions factory, before being handed back to the County Council, when it was the headquarters of the Denbighshire Library Service. In 2004 the Gaol was extensively renovated and reopened as a museum.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/northeastwales/hi/people_and_places/history/newsid_8555000/8555937.stm |work=BBC News |first=Alys |last=Lewis |title=Ruthin Gaol |date=8 March 2010}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Carchar Rhuthun Ruthin Gaol Grade 2 Star.JPG|thumb|180px|Ruthin Gaol is a [[Listed building|Grade 2* listed building]]]]\nThe first House of Correction, or ''Bridewell'', was built at the bottom of Clwyd Street, next to the river, in 1654, to replace the Old Court House, where able-bodied idlers and the unemployed were sent to work. Following [[John Howard (prison reformer)|John Howard]]'s investigations into prison conditions the Denbighshire justices resolved to build a new model prison in Ruthin on the site of the old Bridewell. Work began in January 1775. In 1802 the prison had four cells for prisoners and nine rooms for debtors. By 1837 it could hold 37 inmates. The Prisons Act of 1865 set new standards for the design of prisons \u2013 as the Ruthin County Gaol did not meet the standards, plans were drawn up for a new four-storey wing. The new prison for up to 100 prisoners was built in the style of London's [[Pentonville (HM Prison)|Pentonville Prison]] at a cost of \u00a312,000. On 1 April 1878 the Ruthin County Gaol became HM Prison Ruthin, covering the counties of [[Denbighshire]], [[Flintshire]], and [[Merionethshire]]. As far as is known, only one person was ever executed in the prison: William Hughes of Denbigh, aged 42, who was [[hanged]] on 17 February 1903 for the murder of his wife, his plea of insanity having failed. Another prison personality was [[John Jones (Coch Bach y Bala)|John Jones]], known as ''Coch Bach y Bala'' \u2013 who was a kleptomaniac and poacher who had spent more than half his 60 years in all the prisons of north Wales and many in England; he twice escaped from Ruthin Gaol, first on 30 November 1879 when he walked out of prison with three others while the staff were having supper \u2013 a \u00a35 reward was offered for his capture, which happened on the following 3 January. On 30 September 1913 he tunnelled out of his cell and using a rope made out of his bedding he climbed over the roof of the chapel and kitchen and got over the wall; after seven days living rough on the Nantclwyd Estate several miles away, Jones was shot in the leg by one of his pursuers, 19-year-old Reginald Jones-Bateman. Jones died of shock and blood loss, while Jones-Bateman was charged with manslaughter, though the charges were subsequently dropped.\n\n[[Most Haunted: Midsummer Murders]] filmed the series' fifth episode in Ruthin, where the team investigated a [[Victorian Era]] murder. Locations included the Old Gaol and the town library.\n\n===The Craft Centre===\n{{Main|Ruthin Craft Centre}}\nThe Craft Centre had ten studios occupied by craftsmen who could be watched while they worked at glass blowing, ceramic manufacture, painting, furniture restoration, etc. The original Craft Centre was demolished early in 2007, and a new Craft Centre opened in July 2008 in a \u00a34.3 million scheme, which contains six craft workshops, larger galleries and an expanded craft retail gallery, two residency studios, an education space and a tourist information centre, and a restaurant.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/north_east/4517136.stm |title=\u00a33.1m for craft centre's renewal |accessdate=27 November 2006 |publisher=BBC |work=BBC North East Wales news |date=10 December 2005}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ruthincraftcentre.org.uk/ |title=Canolfan Grefft Rhuthun / Ruthin Craft Centre |access-date=17 September 2008}}</ref>\n\n===Nantclwyd y Dre===\n[[File:Nantclwyd Y Dre - geograph.org.uk - 1189902.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Nantclwyd y Dre]] looking north on Castle Street]]\n{{main|Nantclwyd y Dre}}\n[[Nantclwyd y Dre]] (previously known as [[T\u0177 Nantclwyd]]), in Castle Street, was built about 1435 by a local merchant Gronw ap Madoc.

Ruthin is the only example we have left. It should be carefully conserved, as the last memory we have of these towns.\"<ref>''Encyclopaedia Wales''; University of Wales Press.</ref> [[Seven Eyes]] is a Grade II* listed building of some importance situated in St Peter's Square.\n\n===St Peter's Square===\n;St Peter's Church\n{{main|Collegiate and Parochial Church of St Peter, Ruthin}}\nSt Peter's Church is the [[parish church]] of Ruthin.

It is said to have been built in the 14th century. The [[Architecture of the Netherlands|Dutch style]] design, long, steeped roof is attributed to Sir Richard Clough, an Elizabethan merchant. It has four tiers of dormer windows, each at a different elevation, known locally as the seven eyes of Ruthin. The property was acquired in 1595 by Sir [[Hugh Myddleton]], who provided London with it first fresh water supply. The view of The Myddleton on the square is in fact of the rear of the building. The front of the building looked out over the Clwydian hills.\n\n;HSBC Bank\nFormerly a confectionery and bakery shop rented by Mr Thomas Trehearne, the property was owned by the Castle estate. The property also served as a chemist's shop, and later Dick's boot store. On 1 May 1898 Mr Harris Jones took the lease of the property for 21 years as a draper, hosier, glover and dressmaker; he also sold oilcloths, linoleum and other floor coverings. The shop and house were put up for sale in the 1913 by the castle estate along with the ''Castle Hotel'' and the ''Myddleton Arms'', which were purchased by Mr William Owen. His lease expired in 1919 with Mr Jones transferring to what is now Gayla House, where he converted the ground floor from residential to retail premises in 1923. The premises are now owned by [[HSBC Bank]].\n\n;Exmewe House\nFormerly the Beehive, which served for 75 years as general drapery and millinery shop. The exact date of the building is not known, but remains of timber framing with wattle and daub indicate that the building is very old. An advertisement claimed the building to be constructed prior to 1397. The main section of the building was demolished to make way for the bank. Ruthin Court Rolls refer to a man named Telemann in Ruthin and to a house  \"in the high St.\" The rolls record that, in 1397, Howell de Rowell passed it to John Le Sergant. Little is known of the family \u2013 possibly a retainer of Edward 1st or Reginald de Grey, probably of Norman French descent. On 24 February, Sergant surrendered tenancy to his daughter Sibilia. The property passed to the Exmewe family by the marriage of Sibilia to Richard Exmewe, their son Thomas was Lord Mayor of London in 1517. Little is known of Exmewe family. Thomas moved to London, deciding to sell his Ruthin Estate of Exmewe House.\n\nHe sold the house to a fellow mercer, Edward Goodman. Exmewe House or Nant Clwyd-y-Dre may have been the birthplace of Gabriel Goodman, as the family had connections with both properties.\n\nDetails of the next 200 years are unclear: it became the ''King's Arms'' in the occupation of John Price. It then became the ''Queen's Arms'' (during the reign of Queen Anne, 1702\u20131714). The  property was purchased for \u00a3300 on 5 November 1718 by Robert Myddleton of Chirk.<ref>''Chirk Castle Accounts, AD 1666\u20131753'', edited by William Martial Myddelton</ref> During the 19th century, the property was used as a chemist's until 1913. It was then sold as part of the Castle Estate sales in 1913/1919, for \u00a31275 to Mr Lecomber, who in turn sold it to [[Barclays Bank]], which modernised it to what can be seen today.\n\n;The Post Office\nNow trading as the Celtic Hair Studio at 2 Well Street. Originally a public house, reputedly built in 1401, possibly the oldest pub in Ruthin. Lewis Jones, in his 1884 \"Handbook For Ruthin and the Vicinity\", states that the old property, formerly the ''Ruth Inn'', was adapted to the business of a post office about 25 years previously. It ceased trading in 1773. In 1850, the building was transformed into a draper's, later becoming the town post office until 1904.\n\nThe site of the present post office was possibly a medieval Carmelite priory of White Friars said to be founded and built by Reginald de Grey and partly destroyed by the Reformation. De Grey also provided a large piece of land close to the castle known as Whitefriars. During the 1860s and 1870s the site housed the ''Queen's Head'' public house and a horse-feed chandler; both buildings were destroyed by the 1904 fire when the new post office was built in 1906.\n\n===Clwyd St===\n;Reebees\nLocated at [[Nos.33, 35 & 37 Clwyd Street, Ruthin|33, 35 and 37 Clwyd Street]] opposite the gaol. Now a florist, it was originally the ''Red Lion'' public house. In 1824 the hangman, Sam Burrows, was staying at the ''Red Lion'' on the night before the execution of John Connor, a highway robber. He gave a detailed demonstration of how he actually hanged a man, unfortunately the stool was accidentally kicked away and Burrows almost hanged himself. The public house ceased trading in 1905.\n\n;The ''Royal Oak''\nNow flats, the ''Royal Oak'' is one of the finest buildings in Ruthin, having three cruck frames, it is a Grade II* [[listed building]].\n\n====Porth y D\u0175r====\nAt No. 65 Clwyd Street, this Grade II* listed building retains much of the medieval timber frame internally, the oak for which was felled in 1455 and 1456. Its original purpose is unknown, although it has a medieval arched doorway facing towards the 13th-century mill, and a 15th-century [[Solar (room)|solar]] (private living quarters) with an open roof with cusped windbraces. It is said to have been converted for domestic use in 1586 and occupied by the Moyle family. A two-storey porch with glazed windows (previously described as a balcony) and internal timber panelling was added, possibly in 1655 when further alterations were made. The building was extensively altered in the 19th century, converting part to a shop. Porth y D\u0175r originally formed a single building with No. 67 Clwyd Street (listed Grade II), and adjoined the medieval west gate to the town that was demolished in 1786.<ref>Denbighshire Archives QSD/AB/1/378 Contract for taking down Porth y dwr Gateway</ref>\n\n===Castle Street===\nAll buildings on Castle Street are listed by [[Cadw]]. These are the earliest settlements outside the walls of the castle. Some have [[burgage]] plots at the back, established by de Grey in 1283. The plots and linear have barely changed since their foundation.\n\nWhilst residential properties were at the castle end of the street, commercial properties were at the end close to St Peters Square. The one exception was the pub ''Yr Iwerddon'' at No. 15. The house retains a name referring to its connection with Irish drovers attending markets and fairs\n\nOther establishments of interest include No. 1, now [[Boots UK|Boots]], formerly the ''Raven Inn'', which in 1560 may have been the birthplace of [[Richard Parry (bishop)|Bishop Richard Parry]], pupil and master (1584) of Ruthin School. He was involved with Dean Gabriel Goodman and others in translating the Bible and prayer book into Welsh. The main contributor was Bishop William Morgan, but Parry's revision in 1620 became the accepted authorised version. \n[[File:Ruthin Bowling Club Members Square Ruthin, Wales 1910.jpg|thumb|The old Bowling green at Castle St, c. 1910]]\n\nThe Ruthin Royal Bowling Green used the Raven as their headquarters until the Cornwallis-Wests came to live in Ruthin Castle. The club met at the ''Raven'' for its annual and quarterly meetings. When competitions took place, the staff of the ''Raven'' would take \"Cwrw Da\" (good beer) to the players. With the arrival of the Wests, the bowling green inside the curtilage of the castle forced the club to find an alternative green. One of the options they accepted was the rear of No. 8 Castle street \"Gorphwysfa\", then called the \"Constitutional Club\", later renamed the Conservative Club.\n\n*No. 2. The Wine Vaults with their six-column Tuscan colonnade was 'known as the ''Black Horse'' in the 1820s. This is verified by the Welsh Office survey.\n*No. 7. Sir John Trevor House. This served as Totty's the Lawyers in the 1700s, later as an antique shop, tea shop and finally a private residence offering bed and breakfast accommodation. Sir John Trevor was Speaker of the House of Commons from 1690 to 1695, when he was dismissed for embezzlement. He was the only Speaker to be forced to resign until 19 May 2009, with the forced departure of Michael Martin.\n*\"Gorphwysfa\" This property was part of the Castle estate until sold off by the Castle owners in 1919. The Rifle Volunteer Corps founded in 1859 stored their armoury at the house until the drill hall was built in Borthyn in 1885. As mentioned, this property became the Conservative Club in November 1885.\n*No. 9. When known as \"Corwen\", this property was the offices of Phillips the Attorney's. It is now a private residence. *No. 11. Ardwyn is a private residence on three storeys, formerly the offices of the attorneys Smarts.\n*No. 12. Plas-yn-Dre. The exact date of this house is unknown. It was rebuilt in 1823, as recorded by a stone above the front door. The premises housed the North and South Wales Bank. L. G. Thomas, prime mover in the founding the Presbyterian Church in Wynnstay Road in 1886, was bank manager and lived here.\n*Nos 16 and 18 are wooden-framed buildings with a 19th-century frontage. They formed part of the Castle estate sales of 1913 and 1919. The properties display what is probably the first use of [[stucco]] in Ruthin.\n\n===Record Street===\n;Old County Hall now Ruthin Library\nThis is a Grade II Listed Building, housed in Record Street and originally named Stryd y Chwain (Welsh: Flea St) due to its very low standard of living) The inferior housing was demolished to make way for the county court and much grander houses between 1785 and 1788. The present name reflects the storing of records from the assizes and shire hall. In 1860 it became the county court, with the portico added at that time. It housed the records of and served as an assize court until the 1970s. The library opened in the early 1990s.\n\n;Police station\nA Grade II listed building. Before the present police station was built, the original one was housed in Ruthin Gaol. This was built in 1890, as it gave convenient access to the courts. It contains four cells, which are no longer used, and a much reduced number of police officers present.\n\n===Well Street===\n;Castle Mews Grade II listed building\nNow a shopping precinct this building dates back to the 15th century with examples of wattle and daub just inside the building on the right hand side. Remodelled in the early 19th century, when it became the ''Cross Keys'' coaching inn serving the Ruthin to Chester route with a change of horses in Mold. It later became a temperance commercial hotel and was home to one of the three Ruthin Friendly Societies: groups of male workers of similar background who contributed small amounts on a weekly basis for insurance against injury and old age. At a later date it was the offices of Ruthin Rural District Council.\n\n;No. 10 and 12. Manor House. Grade II listed building\nLate 18th-century family town house, which retained it late Georgian character until developed into today's boutique  hotel and art gallery. The cellars are said to have been constructed of stone from Ruthin Castle. It has had many uses: as a boarding house for Ruthin School until 1893, a doctors home, a family home whose most famous resident was Cynthia Lennon, wife of [[John Lennon]] \u2013 their son Julian attended Ruthin School \u2013 a restaurant from the 1930s and a hotel. Today's hotel architecture and art are very much in mind, having won several awards\n\n;The Wynnstay Hotel And Wayfarer Wool Shop\nThese two separate buildings were once connected by an archway, through which coaches and horses entered to the rear of the properties for the horses to be stabled. The present Wayfarers shop is shown in the title deeds as an outbuilding consisting of \"an old saddle room, l with a room over and Gentleman\u2019s Convenience\".\n\nThe ''Wynnstay Hotel'', now a private house, is first recorded in the records as being established in 1549 and was known for many years as the ''Cross Foxes'', which formed the heraldic arms of the [[Ruabon#The Wynns of Wynnstay|Wynnstay family]]. The family originated from [[Wrexham]] and boasted they could travel from Chester to the [[Ll\u0177n Peninsula]] without once leaving their land. It was an important hostelry, as the coaching inn for Ruthin to Denbigh travellers. It served the Ruthin, Mold and Chester Royal Mail service. The pub in its heyday had a bowling green and tennis courts, and also a central porch, which was demolished in 1969.\n\n;Plas Coch (also known as the Conservative Club) Grade II Listed building.\nThis is of medieval origin and is a former 17th-century town house. It was rebuilt in 1613 using red sandstone from the castle and became home to the Constable of the castle. The building has two storeys with attics and four large windows on each floor. In 1963 it became a banqueting hall owned by Rees Jones, who used to trade at the village hall in [[Llanfair Dyffryn Clwyd|Llanfair]]. It became the Conservative Club in 1977, and having been slightly altered, now offers all-round function facilities.\n\n===Other areas===\n;The ''Spread Eagle'' \nThe ''Spread Eagle'' is the coat-of-arms of the Goodwin family. Formerly an inn, records show it traded only from 1792 to 1915, after which it became a temperance hotel, then a retail shop.\n\n===Rose Cottage===\n[[Rose Cottage, Ruthin|Rose Cottage]] is a privately owned residence and a Grade 2*  listed building located on the  corner of Rhos Street and Haulfryn. It is listed as an \"exceptional survival of a medieval cruck-framed hall-house of relatively low status, retaining its plan-form, character and detail\".<ref>[http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/wa-903-rose-cottage-ruthin British Listed Buildings]; accessed 5 September 2014</ref>\n\n===Scott House===\nSituated on the Corwen Road just past [[Ruthin Castle]], Scott house was built 1933 to house the nursing staff of Duff House Sanatorium, which acquired Ruthin Castle and 475 acres of land for their private clinic in April 1923. The Grade II listed building is set in landscaped grounds.

However, little is known of the history of the town before the construction of [[Ruthin Castle]] was started in 1277 by [[Dafydd ap Gruffydd|Dafydd]], the brother of prince [[Llywelyn ap Gruffudd]]. However, he forfeited the castle when he rebelled against [[Edward I of England|King Edward I]] with his brother; Edward's queen, [[Eleanor of Castile|Eleanor]], was in residence in 1281. The [[Marcher Lord]], [[Baron Grey de Ruthyn|Reginald de Grey]], Justiciar of [[Chester, England|Chester]], was given the ''Cantref'' (an administrative district) of Deffrencloyt (Dyffryn Clwyd, the Welsh for ''Vale of Clwyd''), and his family ran the area for the next 226 years. The [[Reginald Grey, 3rd Baron Grey de Ruthyn|third Baron de Grey]]'s land dispute with [[Owain Glynd\u0175r]] triggered Glynd\u0175r's rebellion against [[Henry IV of England|King Henry IV]], which began on 16 September 1400, when Glynd\u0175r burned Ruthin to the ground, reputedly leaving only the castle and a few other buildings standing.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.castlewales.com/ruthin.html |title=Ruthin castle |accessdate=8 June 2007|last=Northall |first=John }}</ref>\n\nThe Lord de Grey established a [[Collegiate and Parochial Church of St Peter, Ruthin|Collegiate Church]] in 1310. Now the Collegiate and Parish Church of St Peter, it dominates the Ruthin skyline. It has a double nave and boasts two medieval carved roofs. These days it is known for its musical tradition. It has a large choir of children and adults and a four-manual Wadsworth-Willis organ. Behind the church can be seen the old college buildings, school and Christ's Hospital.\n\nA Ruthin native, Sir [[Thomas Exmewe]] was [[Lord Mayor of the City of London]] in 1517\u20131518.\n\nThe half-timbered [[The Old Court House, Ruthin|Old Court House]] (built in 1401), on the square, features the remains of a [[Gibbeting|gibbet]] last used to execute a [[Franciscan]] priest, [[Charles Meehan]], also known as Mahoney.

It was rebuilt in the 19th century as a country house, which has now been turned into the ''Ruthin Castle Hotel''. From 1826 until 1921 the castle was the home of the Cornwallis-West family, members of Victorian and Edwardian high society.\n\nIn its 18th-century heyday as a town on [[Drovers' road|drovers' routes]] from Wales into England, Ruthin was reputed to have \"a pub for every week of the year\". By 2007, however, there were only eleven pubs in the town. The public records of 23 October 1891 show 31 such establishments serving a population of 3,186; most have been converted into housing or shops. [[The Ruthin Union Workhouse]] was built in 1834.\n\nThe first copies of the Welsh [[national anthem]], ''[[Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau]]'', were printed in what is now the ''[[Siop Nain]]'' tea and gift shop on Well Street.\n\nIn 1863 the [[Denbigh, Ruthin and Corwen Railway]], which linked in Denbigh with the [[Vale of Clwyd Railway]] (later part of the [[London and North Western Railway]], the [[London, Midland and Scottish Railway]], and [[British Rail]]) reached the town. The route ran from [[Rhyl]] along the north coast through Denbigh and Ruthin to Corwen, before joining a route from [[Ruabon]] through [[Llangollen]], Corwen and [[Bala, Gwynedd|Bala]] to [[Barmouth]]. The railway and [[Ruthin railway station]] closed in 1963 under the [[Beeching Axe]]. The site of the station is now occupied by a large road roundabout ([[Briec|Brieg]] Roundabout) and the Ruthin Craft Centre, which opened in 1982, but was rebuilt and reopened in 2008.<ref>[http://www.wai.org.uk/index.cfm?UUID=1198892C-65BF-7E43-3802ACEB3BABD04D]</ref>.\n\nRuthin hosted the [[National Eisteddfod of Wales|National Eisteddfod]] in 1868 and 1973. The [[Urdd Gobaith Cymru|Urdd]] National Eisteddfod visited Ruthin in 1992 and 2006.<ref name=BBC_5025078 />\n\n==Education==\nThe town's principal school is [[Ysgol Brynhyfryd]] (Brynhyfryd School), a comprehensive school for 11 to 18 year olds. Its Grade II listed building was built about 1830 as the home of local solicitor, before becoming in 1898 ''Ruthin County School for Girls''. (The town's boys travelled five miles by train to Denbigh High School.) The school went co-educational in 1938, with feeder junior schools up to around six miles away. Building work in the 1950s and the early 1970s increased the number of pupils from 700 to 1000 in a few years, as the minimum school-leaving age rose from 15 to 16). In 2001\u20132002 the listed building became the Sixth Form Centre. The school's sports facilities, including the swimming pool, are used as the town's Leisure Centre. It also features a theatre and arts complex, ''Theatr John Ambrose'', named after a headmaster of the school in the 1980s and 1990s. This was opened by the actor [[Rhys Ifans]], a former pupil of Ysgol Pentrecelyn and Ysgol Maes Garmon in Mold, but brought up in Ruthin.\n\n[[File:Ruthin School Uploads 09.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Pupils at a science laboratory at [[Ruthin School]]]]\nIn 1574 Dr [[Gabriel Goodman]] re-founded [[Ruthin School]] which was founded in 1284, making it one of the oldest private schools in the United Kingdom. In 1590, Goodman established ''Christ's Hospital'' for 12 poor persons around St Peter's Church on the square, and was Dean of [[Westminster Abbey|Westminster]] for 40 years (1561\u20131601). Ruthin School is now a co-educational boarding and day school, with 227 pupils overall, 145 of them boarders in 2014.<ref>[http://www.isc.co.uk/schools/wales/wales-north/ruthin/ruthin-school]</ref> In September 2013, the school bought ''Ye Old Anchor'', after its closure as a hotel in November 2012, and converted it into a boarding house for 30 upper sixth-form students.<ref>http://www.denbighshirefreepress.co.uk/news/130575/transformation-of-pub-for-school-progressing.aspx</ref>\n\n==Transport==\n===Bus===\nRuthin has daytime bus services on Mondays to Saturdays, with the last bus on most routes leaving between 5.30 and 7.30 pm.

Route X51 by Arriva runs basically hourly between [[Rhyl]], [[St Asaph]], [[Denbigh]], Ruthin, and [[Wrexham]] (Rhyl bus station is next to the railway station, providing Ruthin's most convenient access to the national rail network, while [[Wrexham General railway station|Wrexham railway station]] is a short distance from its bus station.) Route 55, by Llew Jones Coaches, operates to [[Corwen]] at intervals of 50\u2013135 minutes through the day, with three buses extended to [[Llangollen]], and two of these via Llangollen to [[Wrexham]]. Route 76, by M & H Coaches, runs six times a day between Denbigh and Ruthin via Llandyrnog, Llangynhafal, and Llanbedr DC; two of these also serve Llanfair DC, Graigfechan, and Pentrecelyn. Less regular services include a weekly route 71 on Fridays between Corwen, [[Cerrigydrudion]], Ruthin, and Morrisons' supermarket in Denbigh, and route 72 on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays for Cyffylliog, Clocaenog, Bontuchel, [[Betws Gwerfil Goch]], Melin-y-Wig, Derwen, and Clawddnewydd. Ruthin town has route 73, operating three buses a day around Ruthin on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays.\n\n===Rail===\n[[File:Ruthin Station 1963 Bevan Price 4.jpg|thumb|Ruthin station 1963]]\nThe [[Denbigh, Ruthin and Corwen Railway|Ruthin railway line]] and [[Ruthin railway station|station]] closed in the 1960s. They had connected Ruthin to {{rws|Denbigh}} and {{rws|Rhyl}} to the north and {{rws|Corwen}} to the south.\n\nIn 1858, it was intended to extend the Vale of Clwyd line from Denbigh to Ruthin, running alongside the race-course in the town park (now Parc-y Dre housing) to the Station Hotel. However the West family prevented the line crossing the Castle Park towards Corwen. The route was diverted to the north alongside the road to [[Wrexham]] and the Station Hotel renamed the Park Place Hotel. Opposite Station Road lies Railway Terrace, a row of Grade II listed buildings, built in 1864 with evidence of trains running in a cutting in front. The first sod was cut in September 1860 by Mrs Florence West, with an inaugural service starting on St David's Day 1862. To mark this, a song was composed with words by T. Ab Gwilym, music by B. Williams and published by [[Isaac Clarke (publisher)|Isaac Clarke]].

Following [[John Howard (prison reformer)|John Howard]]'s investigations into prison conditions the Denbighshire justices resolved to build a new model prison in Ruthin on the site of the old Bridewell. Work began in January 1775. In 1802 the prison had four cells for prisoners and nine rooms for debtors. By 1837 it could hold 37 inmates. The Prisons Act of 1865 set new standards for the design of prisons \u2013 as the Ruthin County Gaol did not meet the standards, plans were drawn up for a new four-storey wing. The new prison for up to 100 prisoners was built in the style of London's [[Pentonville (HM Prison)|Pentonville Prison]] at a cost of \u00a312,000. On 1 April 1878 the Ruthin County Gaol became HM Prison Ruthin, covering the counties of [[Denbighshire]], [[Flintshire]], and [[Merionethshire]]. As far as is known, only one person was ever executed in the prison: William Hughes of Denbigh, aged 42, who was [[hanged]] on 17 February 1903 for the murder of his wife, his plea of insanity having failed. Another prison personality was [[John Jones (Coch Bach y Bala)|John Jones]], known as ''Coch Bach y Bala'' \u2013 who was a kleptomaniac and poacher who had spent more than half his 60 years in all the prisons of north Wales and many in England; he twice escaped from Ruthin Gaol, first on 30 November 1879 when he walked out of prison with three others while the staff were having supper \u2013 a \u00a35 reward was offered for his capture, which happened on the following 3 January. On 30 September 1913 he tunnelled out of his cell and using a rope made out of his bedding he climbed over the roof of the chapel and kitchen and got over the wall; after seven days living rough on the Nantclwyd Estate several miles away, Jones was shot in the leg by one of his pursuers, 19-year-old Reginald Jones-Bateman. Jones died of shock and blood loss, while Jones-Bateman was charged with manslaughter, though the charges were subsequently dropped.\n\n[[Most Haunted: Midsummer Murders]] filmed the series' fifth episode in Ruthin, where the team investigated a [[Victorian Era]] murder. Locations included the Old Gaol and the town library.\n\n===The Craft Centre===\n{{Main|Ruthin Craft Centre}}\nThe Craft Centre had ten studios occupied by craftsmen who could be watched while they worked at glass blowing, ceramic manufacture, painting, furniture restoration, etc. The original Craft Centre was demolished early in 2007, and a new Craft Centre opened in July 2008 in a \u00a34.3 million scheme, which contains six craft workshops, larger galleries and an expanded craft retail gallery, two residency studios, an education space and a tourist information centre, and a restaurant.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/north_east/4517136.stm |title=\u00a33.1m for craft centre's renewal |accessdate=27 November 2006 |publisher=BBC |work=BBC North East Wales news |date=10 December 2005}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ruthincraftcentre.org.uk/ |title=Canolfan Grefft Rhuthun / Ruthin Craft Centre |access-date=17 September 2008}}</ref>\n\n===Nantclwyd y Dre===\n[[File:Nantclwyd Y Dre - geograph.org.uk - 1189902.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Nantclwyd y Dre]] looking north on Castle Street]]\n{{main|Nantclwyd y Dre}}\n[[Nantclwyd y Dre]] (previously known as [[T\u0177 Nantclwyd]]), in Castle Street, was built about 1435 by a local merchant Gronw ap Madoc.

A skate park was built in 2007 and a [[zip wire]] and [[trim trail]] added later. The River Clwyd runs through the park.\n\n==Listed buildings==\nAccording to the historian Peter Smith, \"Until the 18th century most towns in Wales had many black-and-white houses (such as T\u0177 Nantclwyd y Dre). Ruthin is the only example we have left. It should be carefully conserved, as the last memory we have of these towns.\"<ref>''Encyclopaedia Wales''; University of Wales Press.</ref> [[Seven Eyes]] is a Grade II* listed building of some importance situated in St Peter's Square.\n\n===St Peter's Square===\n;St Peter's Church\n{{main|Collegiate and Parochial Church of St Peter, Ruthin}}\nSt Peter's Church is the [[parish church]] of Ruthin. It is in the [[diocese of St Asaph]].<ref>[http://www.ruthintownparishes.info/ruthin.html Ruthin Town Parishes website;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150319233034/http://www.ruthintownparishes.info/ruthin.html |date=19 March 2015}} accessed 19 September 2014</ref> Parts are as old as 1282.\n\n;The ''Myddleton Arms''\nThe ''Myddleton Arms'' is also known as the ''[[Seven Eyes]]''. It is said to have been built in the 14th century. The [[Architecture of the Netherlands|Dutch style]] design, long, steeped roof is attributed to Sir Richard Clough, an Elizabethan merchant. It has four tiers of dormer windows, each at a different elevation, known locally as the seven eyes of Ruthin. The property was acquired in 1595 by Sir [[Hugh Myddleton]], who provided London with it first fresh water supply. The view of The Myddleton on the square is in fact of the rear of the building. The front of the building looked out over the Clwydian hills.\n\n;HSBC Bank\nFormerly a confectionery and bakery shop rented by Mr Thomas Trehearne, the property was owned by the Castle estate. The property also served as a chemist's shop, and later Dick's boot store. On 1 May 1898 Mr Harris Jones took the lease of the property for 21 years as a draper, hosier, glover and dressmaker; he also sold oilcloths, linoleum and other floor coverings. The shop and house were put up for sale in the 1913 by the castle estate along with the ''Castle Hotel'' and the ''Myddleton Arms'', which were purchased by Mr William Owen. His lease expired in 1919 with Mr Jones transferring to what is now Gayla House, where he converted the ground floor from residential to retail premises in 1923. The premises are now owned by [[HSBC Bank]].\n\n;Exmewe House\nFormerly the Beehive, which served for 75 years as general drapery and millinery shop. The exact date of the building is not known, but remains of timber framing with wattle and daub indicate that the building is very old. An advertisement claimed the building to be constructed prior to 1397. The main section of the building was demolished to make way for the bank. Ruthin Court Rolls refer to a man named Telemann in Ruthin and to a house  \"in the high St.\" The rolls record that, in 1397, Howell de Rowell passed it to John Le Sergant. Little is known of the family \u2013 possibly a retainer of Edward 1st or Reginald de Grey, probably of Norman French descent. On 24 February, Sergant surrendered tenancy to his daughter Sibilia. The property passed to the Exmewe family by the marriage of Sibilia to Richard Exmewe, their son Thomas was Lord Mayor of London in 1517. Little is known of Exmewe family. Thomas moved to London, deciding to sell his Ruthin Estate of Exmewe House.\n\nHe sold the house to a fellow mercer, Edward Goodman. Exmewe House or Nant Clwyd-y-Dre may have been the birthplace of Gabriel Goodman, as the family had connections with both properties.\n\nDetails of the next 200 years are unclear: it became the ''King's Arms'' in the occupation of John Price. It then became the ''Queen's Arms'' (during the reign of Queen Anne, 1702\u20131714). The  property was purchased for \u00a3300 on 5 November 1718 by Robert Myddleton of Chirk.<ref>''Chirk Castle Accounts, AD 1666\u20131753'', edited by William Martial Myddelton</ref> During the 19th century, the property was used as a chemist's until 1913. It was then sold as part of the Castle Estate sales in 1913/1919, for \u00a31275 to Mr Lecomber, who in turn sold it to [[Barclays Bank]], which modernised it to what can be seen today.\n\n;The Post Office\nNow trading as the Celtic Hair Studio at 2 Well Street. Originally a public house, reputedly built in 1401, possibly the oldest pub in Ruthin. Lewis Jones, in his 1884 \"Handbook For Ruthin and the Vicinity\", states that the old property, formerly the ''Ruth Inn'', was adapted to the business of a post office about 25 years previously. It ceased trading in 1773. In 1850, the building was transformed into a draper's, later becoming the town post office until 1904.\n\nThe site of the present post office was possibly a medieval Carmelite priory of White Friars said to be founded and built by Reginald de Grey and partly destroyed by the Reformation. De Grey also provided a large piece of land close to the castle known as Whitefriars. During the 1860s and 1870s the site housed the ''Queen's Head'' public house and a horse-feed chandler; both buildings were destroyed by the 1904 fire when the new post office was built in 1906.\n\n===Clwyd St===\n;Reebees\nLocated at [[Nos.33, 35 & 37 Clwyd Street, Ruthin|33, 35 and 37 Clwyd Street]] opposite the gaol. Now a florist, it was originally the ''Red Lion'' public house. In 1824 the hangman, Sam Burrows, was staying at the ''Red Lion'' on the night before the execution of John Connor, a highway robber. He gave a detailed demonstration of how he actually hanged a man, unfortunately the stool was accidentally kicked away and Burrows almost hanged himself. The public house ceased trading in 1905.\n\n;The ''Royal Oak''\nNow flats, the ''Royal Oak'' is one of the finest buildings in Ruthin, having three cruck frames, it is a Grade II* [[listed building]].\n\n====Porth y D\u0175r====\nAt No. 65 Clwyd Street, this Grade II* listed building retains much of the medieval timber frame internally, the oak for which was felled in 1455 and 1456. Its original purpose is unknown, although it has a medieval arched doorway facing towards the 13th-century mill, and a 15th-century [[Solar (room)|solar]] (private living quarters) with an open roof with cusped windbraces. It is said to have been converted for domestic use in 1586 and occupied by the Moyle family. A two-storey porch with glazed windows (previously described as a balcony) and internal timber panelling was added, possibly in 1655 when further alterations were made. The building was extensively altered in the 19th century, converting part to a shop. Porth y D\u0175r originally formed a single building with No. 67 Clwyd Street (listed Grade II), and adjoined the medieval west gate to the town that was demolished in 1786.<ref>Denbighshire Archives QSD/AB/1/378 Contract for taking down Porth y dwr Gateway</ref>\n\n===Castle Street===\nAll buildings on Castle Street are listed by [[Cadw]]. These are the earliest settlements outside the walls of the castle. Some have [[burgage]] plots at the back, established by de Grey in 1283. The plots and linear have barely changed since their foundation.\n\nWhilst residential properties were at the castle end of the street, commercial properties were at the end close to St Peters Square. The one exception was the pub ''Yr Iwerddon'' at No. 15. The house retains a name referring to its connection with Irish drovers attending markets and fairs\n\nOther establishments of interest include No. 1, now [[Boots UK|Boots]], formerly the ''Raven Inn'', which in 1560 may have been the birthplace of [[Richard Parry (bishop)|Bishop Richard Parry]], pupil and master (1584) of Ruthin School. He was involved with Dean Gabriel Goodman and others in translating the Bible and prayer book into Welsh. The main contributor was Bishop William Morgan, but Parry's revision in 1620 became the accepted authorised version. \n[[File:Ruthin Bowling Club Members Square Ruthin, Wales 1910.jpg|thumb|The old Bowling green at Castle St, c. 1910]]\n\nThe Ruthin Royal Bowling Green used the Raven as their headquarters until the Cornwallis-Wests came to live in Ruthin Castle. The club met at the ''Raven'' for its annual and quarterly meetings. When competitions took place, the staff of the ''Raven'' would take \"Cwrw Da\" (good beer) to the players. With the arrival of the Wests, the bowling green inside the curtilage of the castle forced the club to find an alternative green. One of the options they accepted was the rear of No. 8 Castle street \"Gorphwysfa\", then called the \"Constitutional Club\", later renamed the Conservative Club.\n\n*No. 2. The Wine Vaults with their six-column Tuscan colonnade was 'known as the ''Black Horse'' in the 1820s. This is verified by the Welsh Office survey.\n*No. 7. Sir John Trevor House. This served as Totty's the Lawyers in the 1700s, later as an antique shop, tea shop and finally a private residence offering bed and breakfast accommodation. Sir John Trevor was Speaker of the House of Commons from 1690 to 1695, when he was dismissed for embezzlement. He was the only Speaker to be forced to resign until 19 May 2009, with the forced departure of Michael Martin.\n*\"Gorphwysfa\" This property was part of the Castle estate until sold off by the Castle owners in 1919. The Rifle Volunteer Corps founded in 1859 stored their armoury at the house until the drill hall was built in Borthyn in 1885. As mentioned, this property became the Conservative Club in November 1885.\n*No. 9. When known as \"Corwen\", this property was the offices of Phillips the Attorney's. It is now a private residence. *No. 11. Ardwyn is a private residence on three storeys, formerly the offices of the attorneys Smarts.\n*No. 12. Plas-yn-Dre. The exact date of this house is unknown. It was rebuilt in 1823, as recorded by a stone above the front door. The premises housed the North and South Wales Bank. L. G. Thomas, prime mover in the founding the Presbyterian Church in Wynnstay Road in 1886, was bank manager and lived here.\n*Nos 16 and 18 are wooden-framed buildings with a 19th-century frontage. They formed part of the Castle estate sales of 1913 and 1919. The properties display what is probably the first use of [[stucco]] in Ruthin.\n\n===Record Street===\n;Old County Hall now Ruthin Library\nThis is a Grade II Listed Building, housed in Record Street and originally named Stryd y Chwain (Welsh: Flea St) due to its very low standard of living) The inferior housing was demolished to make way for the county court and much grander houses between 1785 and 1788. The present name reflects the storing of records from the assizes and shire hall. In 1860 it became the county court, with the portico added at that time. It housed the records of and served as an assize court until the 1970s. The library opened in the early 1990s.\n\n;Police station\nA Grade II listed building. Before the present police station was built, the original one was housed in Ruthin Gaol. This was built in 1890, as it gave convenient access to the courts. It contains four cells, which are no longer used, and a much reduced number of police officers present.\n\n===Well Street===\n;Castle Mews Grade II listed building\nNow a shopping precinct this building dates back to the 15th century with examples of wattle and daub just inside the building on the right hand side. Remodelled in the early 19th century, when it became the ''Cross Keys'' coaching inn serving the Ruthin to Chester route with a change of horses in Mold. It later became a temperance commercial hotel and was home to one of the three Ruthin Friendly Societies: groups of male workers of similar background who contributed small amounts on a weekly basis for insurance against injury and old age. At a later date it was the offices of Ruthin Rural District Council.\n\n;No. 10 and 12. Manor House. Grade II listed building\nLate 18th-century family town house, which retained it late Georgian character until developed into today's boutique  hotel and art gallery. The cellars are said to have been constructed of stone from Ruthin Castle. It has had many uses: as a boarding house for Ruthin School until 1893, a doctors home, a family home whose most famous resident was Cynthia Lennon, wife of [[John Lennon]] \u2013 their son Julian attended Ruthin School \u2013 a restaurant from the 1930s and a hotel. Today's hotel architecture and art are very much in mind, having won several awards\n\n;The Wynnstay Hotel And Wayfarer Wool Shop\nThese two separate buildings were once connected by an archway, through which coaches and horses entered to the rear of the properties for the horses to be stabled. The present Wayfarers shop is shown in the title deeds as an outbuilding consisting of \"an old saddle room, l with a room over and Gentleman\u2019s Convenience\".\n\nThe ''Wynnstay Hotel'', now a private house, is first recorded in the records as being established in 1549 and was known for many years as the ''Cross Foxes'', which formed the heraldic arms of the [[Ruabon#The Wynns of Wynnstay|Wynnstay family]]. The family originated from [[Wrexham]] and boasted they could travel from Chester to the [[Ll\u0177n Peninsula]] without once leaving their land. It was an important hostelry, as the coaching inn for Ruthin to Denbigh travellers. It served the Ruthin, Mold and Chester Royal Mail service. The pub in its heyday had a bowling green and tennis courts, and also a central porch, which was demolished in 1969.\n\n;Plas Coch (also known as the Conservative Club) Grade II Listed building.\nThis is of medieval origin and is a former 17th-century town house. It was rebuilt in 1613 using red sandstone from the castle and became home to the Constable of the castle. The building has two storeys with attics and four large windows on each floor. In 1963 it became a banqueting hall owned by Rees Jones, who used to trade at the village hall in [[Llanfair Dyffryn Clwyd|Llanfair]]. It became the Conservative Club in 1977, and having been slightly altered, now offers all-round function facilities.\n\n===Other areas===\n;The ''Spread Eagle'' \nThe ''Spread Eagle'' is the coat-of-arms of the Goodwin family. Formerly an inn, records show it traded only from 1792 to 1915, after which it became a temperance hotel, then a retail shop.\n\n===Rose Cottage===\n[[Rose Cottage, Ruthin|Rose Cottage]] is a privately owned residence and a Grade 2*  listed building located on the  corner of Rhos Street and Haulfryn. It is listed as an \"exceptional survival of a medieval cruck-framed hall-house of relatively low status, retaining its plan-form, character and detail\".<ref>[http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/wa-903-rose-cottage-ruthin British Listed Buildings]; accessed 5 September 2014</ref>\n\n===Scott House===\nSituated on the Corwen Road just past [[Ruthin Castle]], Scott house was built 1933 to house the nursing staff of Duff House Sanatorium, which acquired Ruthin Castle and 475 acres of land for their private clinic in April 1923. The Grade II listed building is set in landscaped grounds. The building was later divided into flats.\n\n==Notable people==\n:''See [[:Category:People from Ruthin]]''\n*[[Evan Owen Allen]] (1805\u20131852), Welsh-language writer and poet, died in Ruthin.\n*[[Hafina Clwyd]], journalist, mayor of Ruthin (2008\u20139) and town councillor (1999\u20132011)\n*[[Doug Dailey]] MBE, British cyclist \n*[[Wynn Edwards]] (1842\u20131900), American farmer and politician\n*[[Seren Gibson]], glamour model, attended Ysgol Brynhyfryd.\n*[[Scarlets]] rugby union centre [[Rob Higgitt]] is a former resident.\n*Actors [[Rhys Ifans]] and his brother [[Ll\u0177r Ifans]] come from Ruthin.\n*[[Eric Jones (climber)|Eric Jones]], climber and [[BASE jump]]er, was raised on a farm near Ruthin.\n*[[Henry Haydn Jones|Sir Henry Haydn Jones MP]] (1863\u20131950) politician, slate quarry owner, and owner of the [[Talyllyn Railway]] was brought up in the town.\n*Musician [[Julian Lennon]] attended Ruthin School.\n*[[Eifion Lewis-Roberts]], rugby union player for [[Ruthin RFC|Ruthin]], now lives in [[Llanbedr-Dyffryn-Clwyd]].\n*[[Robin Llwyd ab Owain]], poet and national chair winner, has lived in Ruthin since 1979.\n*[[Rhys Meirion]] the [[English National Opera|ENO]] opera singer\n*[[Cynthia Powell|Cynthia Lennon]], first wife of [[John Lennon]], settled in Ruthin.\n*[[Formula One]] racing driver [[Tom Pryce]] was born and raised in Ruthin.\n*On 6 June 1947 [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Raczkiewicz]], the first president of the [[Polish government in exile]], died at Ruthin Castle.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://archive.thetablet.co.uk/article/14th-june-1947/5/wladyslaw-raczkiewicz-president-of-poland |title=Wladyslaw Raczkiewicz : President of Poland |last1=Beamish, MC, MP |first1=Major Tufton |date=14 June 1947 |website=\"The Tablet\" archive |publisher=The Tablet |accessdate=5 January 2014}}</ref> He was buried in the Polish Cemetery in [[Newark-on-Trent|Newark]], [[Nottinghamshire]]\n*[[Neil Taylor (footballer)|Neil Taylor]], professional football player, attended Ysgol Brynhyfryd.\n*[[Stanley J.

The first female journalist in Iran, r, numbers 11\u201312 (December 1973 \u2013 January 1974) .</ref>\n\n== Career ==\nMaryam Amid Semnani published a [[women's magazine]] named ''Shokoufeh''. Shokouefeh provided the opportunity for both women and men to be informed about [[Women's rights|equal rights]]. Additionally, Maryam established two branches of a modern school named Dokhetaran Dar al-'Elm and Sanuayeh Maziniyeh. She was also a member of the [[Women's rights in Iran|Women's Rights]] Activists Association, which promoted the use of domestic goods and encouraged the acquisition of handicrafts by men. She translated several French books into the [[Persian language]].\n\n== The establishment of a girls\u2019 school ==\nThe establishment of a [[Single-sex education|girls' school]] was one of the lasting and enduring works of Maryam Amid. In 1951, she founded a girls' school called Mazineyeh.\n\nDue to patriarchal circumstances and the reluctance of families to educate their daughters, she encouraged girls to register to become a student without paying. This was done for one out of every two students and she agreed with their parents and families that they should study and not be taken out of school till the end of their courses. This was the way she encouraged girls to stay in school and study. The school had two branches. One of the branches was Dar al-'Elm and various sciences (Such as reading and writing to mathematics and geography and foreign language training) were taught, and the condition of admission was passing a test held by the Ministry of Education. This school was located beside the garden of Asfal-Dooleh. The second branch, Dar Al- Sanayeh, was located in the Abmangel neighborhood, teaching works of art and [[Handicraft]]s (carpet [[weaving]], [[knitting]], etc).<ref name=\":0\">[http://www.beytoote.com/scientific/scientist/first-1woman1-journalist.html  The biography of the first female Iranian journalist]</ref>\n\n== First Iranian woman journalist ==\nAt a time when reading and writing were uncommon for women and the education of women was largely frowned upon, Maryam was able to launch the first Iranian [[women's magazine]]. This 8-page weekly magazine, known as Science, was published in [[Tehran]] in 1910. Although the magazine did not last long, it was an important development during the Constitutional era. \n\nMaryam Amid, known as the first female journalist in Iran, published the Shokoufeh Newspaper after the closure of the Science Weekly Magazine in 1913.\n\nThe following text was seen on the front page and certification of the journal:<ref name=\":0\" />\n{{quote|Awarding officer and director Maryam Amid, the daughter of the late Aqa Mirza Sayed Razi, was a journalist of ethics, literature, hygiene, child care, direct professional education of maidens, and the refinement of women's ethics about women's schools. Sometimes these were known in two levels.}}\n\n== Shokoufeh Newspaper ==\nThe ''Shokoufeh Newspaper'' was the second significant dedicated newspaper published for women after the Science Magazine (1910\u20131911) in 1913. This newspaper was published every week till the death of Maryam in 1919.\n\nThe features of this newspaper were written in a [[Humour|humorous]] and critical tone, such as addressing Iranian women's issues, [[Girls education|girls' education]], and political issues.\n\n=== From copies to caricaturing\t===\nThe newspaper, which was published almost every two weeks, originally consisted of four pages with the Traditional version in the writing of [[Naskh (script)|Naskhs]], but from the fifth issue was written with the [[Nasta\u02bfl\u012bq script|Nastaliq]] version, and was printed after a year with lead letters. Also the final page of each issue was decorated with a [[caricature]], referring to the subject matter that the issue was about.  From the third year onward the caricatures were not included, after the start of the [[First World War]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Hemat Association ==\nThe Hemat Association was established in 1944 by the managers of the girls\u2019 schools. Maryam Amid, a member of this association, was instrumental in introducing and expanding its activities. One of the important goals of the association, which was headed by Mrs. Nuraldji, was to ban foreign products and prohibit imports of these products. For example, at that time the boycott of foreign textiles was on the agenda of this association, and all girls' schools (including students and teachers) were allowed to use only Iranian fabrics and, if there was a violation and purchase of foreign textiles, the guilty person would be fired. As a result, nearly five thousand people joined the boycott within a month. \n\n== War with superstition ==\nThe struggle against [[superstition]] and fighting against old traditions, especially among women was one of the activities of Maryam. She used the ''Shokoufeh newspaper'' to expose oppression  and her reactionary ideas. Maryam, in condemning women's [[underdeveloped]] traditions in [[Iran]], reviewed and compared the situation of women in other parts of the world (especially  of [[women in Europe]]), and considered this as the most important and [fundamental] way to improve women's awareness in Iran.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Death ==\nMaryam died in September 1919 during a trip to her hometown [[Semnan, Iran|Semnan]], of a heart attack. \n \n==See also==\n* [[Iranian women]]   \n* [[Women's rights movement in Iran]]\n* [[Women's rights in Iran]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n* \u0641\u0631\u0647\u0646\u06af \u0642\u0648\u0645\u0633\u061b \u0641\u0635\u0644\u0646\u0627\u0645\u0647 \u067e\u0698\u0648\u0647\u0634\u06cc\u060c \u0641\u0631\u0647\u0646\u06af\u06cc\u060c \u0647\u0646\u0631\u06cc \u0627\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646 \u0633\u0645\u0646\u0627\u0646\u060c \u0634\u0645\u0627\u0631\u0647 \u06f3\u06f7 \u0648 \u06f3\u06f8 \u0628\u0647\u0627\u0631 \u0648 \u062a\u0627\u0628\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646 \u06f1\u06f3\u06f8\u06f6/Ghomis Culture, The quarterly research of cultural and artistic in Semnan Province, numbers 37\u201338, spring and summer 2007.\n* \u0631\u0648\u0632\u0646\u0627\u0645\u0647 \u0633\u0631\u0645\u0627\u06cc\u0647\u060c \u0634\u0645\u0627\u0631\u0647 \u06f2\u06f5\u06f7 (\u06f2 \u0634\u0647\u0631\u06cc\u0648\u0631 \u06f1\u06f3\u06f8\u06f5)-\tSarmayeh Newspaper, number 257, (24 August 2006). \n* [http://www.sharghnewspaper.ir/830514/media.htm#s94047 /Journalist women under the shadow of constitutionalism]{{Dead link|date=March 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.barnameh-budjeh.com/npview.asp?ID=1118573 Maryam Amid, Girls' Literacy Light]{{Dead link|date=March 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Amid, Maryam}}\n[[Category:People from Semnan, Iran]]\n[[Category:1919 deaths]]\n[[Category:Iranian journalists]]\n[[Category:Iranian women journalists]]\n[[Category:Iranian women's rights activists]]\n[[Category:Iranian women writers]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2020}}\n{{copyedit|date=April 2020}}\n'''Maryam Amid Semnani''' ({{lang-fa|\u0645\u0631\u06cc\u0645 \u0639\u0645\u06cc\u062f \u0633\u0645\u0646\u0627\u0646\u06cc}}), was an intellectual and a journalist during the [[Qajar era]].

The first female journalist in Iran, Ghohar, numbers 11\u201312 (December 1973 \u2013 January 1974) .</ref>\n\n== Career ==\nMaryam Amid Semnani published a [[women's magazine]] named ''Shokoufeh''. Shokouefeh provided the opportunity for both women and men to be informed about [[Women's rights|equal rights]]. Additionally, Maryam established two branches of a modern school named Dokhetaran Dar al-'Elm and Sanuayeh Maziniyeh. She was also a member of the [[Women's rights in Iran|Women's Rights]] Activists Association, which promoted the use of domestic goods and encouraged the acquisition of handicrafts by men. She translated several French books into the [[Persian language]].\n\n== The establishment of a girls\u2019 school ==\nThe establishment of a [[Single-sex education|girls' school]] was one of the lasting and enduring works of Maryam Amid. In 1951, she founded a girls' school called Mazineyeh.\n\nDue to patriarchal circumstances and the reluctance of families to educate their daughters, she encouraged girls to register to become a student without paying. This was done for one out of every two students and she agreed with their parents and families that they should study and not be taken out of school till the end of their courses. This was the way she encouraged girls to stay in school and study. The school had two branches. One of the branches was Dar al-'Elm and various sciences (Such as reading and writing to mathematics and geography and foreign language training) were taught, and the condition of admission was passing a test held by the Ministry of Education. This school was located beside the garden of Asfal-Dooleh. The second branch, Dar Al- Sanayeh, was located in the Abmangel neighborhood, teaching works of art and [[Handicraft]]s (carpet [[weaving]], [[knitting]], etc).<ref name=\":0\">[http://www.beytoote.com/scientific/scientist/first-1woman1-journalist.html  The biography of the first female Iranian journalist]</ref>\n\n== First Iranian woman journalist ==\nAt a time when reading and writing were uncommon for women and the education of women was largely frowned upon, Maryam was able to launch the first Iranian [[women's magazine]]. This 8-page weekly magazine, known as Science, was published in [[Tehran]] in 1910. Although the magazine did not last long, it was an important development during the Constitutional era. \n\nMaryam Amid, known as the first female journalist in Iran, published the Shokoufeh Newspaper after the closure of the Science Weekly Magazine in 1913.\n\nThe following text was seen on the front page and certification of the journal:<ref name=\":0\" />\n{{quote|Awarding officer and director Maryam Amid, the daughter of the late Aqa Mirza Sayed Razi, was a journalist of ethics, literature, hygiene, child care, direct professional education of maidens, and the refinement of women's ethics about women's schools. Sometimes these were known in two levels.}}\n\n== Shokoufeh Newspaper ==\nThe ''Shokoufeh Newspaper'' was the second significant dedicated newspaper published for women after the Science Magazine (1910\u20131911) in 1913. This newspaper was published every week till the death of Maryam in 1919.\n\nThe features of this newspaper were written in a [[Humour|humorous]] and critical tone, such as addressing Iranian women's issues, [[Girls education|girls' education]], and political issues.\n\n=== From copies to caricaturing\t===\nThe newspaper, which was published almost every two weeks, originally consisted of four pages with the Traditional version in the writing of [[Naskh (script)|Naskhs]], but from the fifth issue was written with the [[Nasta\u02bfl\u012bq script|Nastaliq]] version, and was printed after a year with lead letters. Also the final page of each issue was decorated with a [[caricature]], referring to the subject matter that the issue was about.  From the third year onward the caricatures were not included, after the start of the [[First World War]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Hemat Association ==\nThe Hemat Association was established in 1944 by the managers of the girls\u2019 schools. Maryam Amid, a member of this association, was instrumental in introducing and expanding its activities. One of the important goals of the association, which was headed by Mrs. Nuraldji, was to ban foreign products and prohibit imports of these products. For example, at that time the boycott of foreign textiles was on the agenda of this association, and all girls' schools (including students and teachers) were allowed to use only Iranian fabrics and, if there was a violation and purchase of foreign textiles, the guilty person would be fired. As a result, nearly five thousand people joined the boycott within a month. \n\n== War with superstition ==\nThe struggle against [[superstition]] and fighting against old traditions, especially among women was one of the activities of Maryam. She used the ''Shokoufeh newspaper'' to expose oppression  and her reactionary ideas. Maryam, in condemning women's [[underdeveloped]] traditions in [[Iran]], reviewed and compared the situation of women in other parts of the world (especially  of [[women in Europe]]), and considered this as the most important and [fundamental] way to improve women's awareness in Iran.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Death ==\nMaryam died in September 1919 during a trip to her hometown [[Semnan, Iran|Semnan]], of a heart attack. \n \n==See also==\n* [[Iranian women]]   \n* [[Women's rights movement in Iran]]\n* [[Women's rights in Iran]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n* \u0641\u0631\u0647\u0646\u06af \u0642\u0648\u0645\u0633\u061b \u0641\u0635\u0644\u0646\u0627\u0645\u0647 \u067e\u0698\u0648\u0647\u0634\u06cc\u060c \u0641\u0631\u0647\u0646\u06af\u06cc\u060c \u0647\u0646\u0631\u06cc \u0627\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646 \u0633\u0645\u0646\u0627\u0646\u060c \u0634\u0645\u0627\u0631\u0647 \u06f3\u06f7 \u0648 \u06f3\u06f8 \u0628\u0647\u0627\u0631 \u0648 \u062a\u0627\u0628\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646 \u06f1\u06f3\u06f8\u06f6/Ghomis Culture, The quarterly research of cultural and artistic in Semnan Province, numbers 37\u201338, spring and summer 2007.\n* \u0631\u0648\u0632\u0646\u0627\u0645\u0647 \u0633\u0631\u0645\u0627\u06cc\u0647\u060c \u0634\u0645\u0627\u0631\u0647 \u06f2\u06f5\u06f7 (\u06f2 \u0634\u0647\u0631\u06cc\u0648\u0631 \u06f1\u06f3\u06f8\u06f5)-\tSarmayeh Newspaper, number 257, (24 August 2006). \n* [http://www.sharghnewspaper.ir/830514/media.htm#s94047 /Journalist women under the shadow of constitutionalism]{{Dead link|date=March 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.barnameh-budjeh.com/npview.asp?ID=1118573 Maryam Amid, Girls' Literacy Light]{{Dead link|date=March 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Amid, Maryam}}\n[[Category:People from Semnan, Iran]]\n[[Category:1919 deaths]]\n[[Category:Iranian journalists]]\n[[Category:Iranian women journalists]]\n[[Category:Iranian women's rights activists]]\n[[Category:Iranian women writers]]\n", "name_user": "Oofus15", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryam_Amid"}

In 2018, the city's estimated population was 73,964. Flagstaff's combined metropolitan area has an estimated population of 139,097.\n\nFlagstaff lies near the southwestern edge of the [[Colorado Plateau]] and within the [[San Francisco volcanic field]], along the western side of the largest contiguous [[Pinus ponderosa|ponderosa pine]] forest in the continental United States. The city sits at around {{convert|7000|ft}} and is next to [[Mount Elden]], just south of the [[San Francisco Peaks]], the highest mountain range in the state of Arizona. [[Humphreys Peak]], the highest point in Arizona at {{convert|12633|ft}}, is about {{convert|10|mi|km}} north of Flagstaff in [[Kachina Peaks Wilderness]]. The geology of the Flagstaff area includes exposed rock from the [[Mesozoic]] and [[Paleozoic]] eras, with [[Moenkopi Formation]] red sandstone having once been quarried in the city; many of the historic downtown buildings were constructed with it. The Rio de Flag river runs through the city.\n\nOriginally settled by the [[pre-Columbian]] native [[Sinagua]] people, the area of Flagstaff has fertile land from volcanic ash after eruptions in the 11th century. It was first settled as the present-day city in 1876. The early economy was based on the [[lumber]], railroad, and [[ranching]] industries, and was dominated by the McMillan, Riordan, and Babbitt families. It was also selected as the location for the [[Lowell Observatory]] due to its altitude, from which [[Pluto]] was discovered. The Riordans and Babbitts lobbied for [[U.S. Route 66|Route 66]] to pass through the city, which it did, turning the local industry to tourism and developing downtown Flagstaff; though it brought [[Okie]]s to the city during the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]], Route 66 also presented funding opportunities that ultimately improved the economy in the early 1930s. The city developed further through to the end of the 1960s, with various observatories also used to choose [[Moon landing]] sites for the [[List of Apollo missions|Apollo missions]]. Through the 1970s and '80s, downtown fell into disrepair, but was revitalized with a major cultural heritage project in the 1990s.\n\nThe city remains an important distribution hub for companies such as [[Nestl\u00e9 Purina PetCare]], and is home to the [[United States Naval Observatory Flagstaff Station|U.S. Naval Observatory Flagstaff Station]], the [[United States Geological Survey]] Flagstaff Station, and [[Northern Arizona University]].

As part of the celebrations, Front Street was renamed Santa Fe Avenue. In 1927, Flagstaff's primary industry was still timber, though farming persisted into the 1920s. The city produced the majority of Arizona's timber supply that year, and was economically powered by the competing Arizona Lumber and Timber and Flagstaff Lumber companies, but in the last years of the decade, tourism took over and the face of the main commercial district changed to diners and motels in place of saloons.<ref name=\":8\" /> In 1928 the [[Museum of Northern Arizona]] opened in the city, and in the same year its workers prevented the destruction of Sunset Crater for use in a movie explosion.<ref name=\":12\" /> \n\nAt the start of the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]], the massive expansion of Flagstaff and Coconino County during the 1920s was seen as likely unsustainable with a lower income. It was made worse by the [[Okie|unemployed workers]] traveling Route 66 to California stopping in Flagstaff, and young jobless Canadians venturing to the area for exploration having to be supported by the city before being deported. Southard wrote that the \"down-on-their-luck migrants taxed the resources of their host cities, while contributing little to the local economy\".<ref name=\":8\" /> Known as \"auto nomads\" in Flagstaff, out-of-work families relocating to the city with children were particularly taxing on the public school system, and even those that did not stay long became unpopular as they could not afford to buy gas or food.<ref name=\":8\" /> Flagstaff had also been highlighted on the map by [[Clyde Tombaugh]]'s 1930 discovery of [[Pluto]] from the Lowell Observatory; the planet was in part named for Percival Lowell (PL).<ref name=\"USNO\" /><ref name=\":12\" /> However, some Flagstaff residents attempted charitable endeavors, including setting up food banks and imploring hunters in the local area to donate a percentage of each kill to them. This did not last long, as in the winter of 1931\u201332, a rumor that California had closed its borders to [[Midwestern United States|Mid West]] migrants spread through Arizona, with people from places like Flagstaff and [[Yuma, Arizona|Yuma]], the last cities on major cross-country highways before California, demanding that Arizona be closed to migrants, too.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\nThe importance of Route 66 to cross-country travel, and thus to Arizona's interests on a national level, did mean that it received a large share of state funding through the Depression, though, with highway maintenance and unemployment acts providing over $1 million of funding in May 1933. Flagstaff's unemployed soon became highway construction workers, and by the end of 1934, Flagstaff had financially recovered to pre-Depression levels, aided by tax cuts and continued tourism; in 1935, many residents had enough disposable income to remodel their homes or build new ones.

[[Types of volcanic eruptions|Eruptions]] occurred between 3 million and 1,000 years ago, affecting the Paleozoic and Mesozoic rocks.<ref name=\":23\" />\n\n[[File:SanFranciscoPeaks.ASTER,20031021.jpg|thumb|left|Flagstaff and surrounding volcanic formations; image from [[United States Geological Survey|USGS]] made using [[Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer|ASTER]] data|alt=Isometric topographic map]]\nThe San Francisco [[stratovolcano]] shape was formed by [[glacial ice]] movements occurring over the past 1.8 million years, and the mountains formed through various geologic activity between 2.8 million and 220,000 years ago, finishing when the Sugarloaf of the Inner Basin formed. The stratovolcano is predominantly formed of [[andesite]]; stratovolcanoes are more commonly found in [[Ring of Fire|highly volatile areas around the Pacific]]. It contains various features of glaciation. Mount Elden is a [[lava dome]] made of [[dacite]]. Sunset Crater and [[S P Crater]] are much geologically younger and have not been weathered very much; Sunset Crater is the youngest feature of the San Francisco volcanic field and formed in the last 1,000 years. S P Crater was formed between 75,000 and 70,000 years ago by piles of [[lapilli]] and [[volcanic bombs]] spouting from a [[lava lake]], while Sunset Crater's formation was an [[explosive eruption]].<ref name=\":23\" /> \n\nMoenkopi Formation red sandstone is a distinctive feature of Flagstaff, as it was used as a building material from the 1880s because of its fire retardant properties. The source used for quarrying most of this rock was a deposit 1 mile east of the town, which fell under the control of Charles Begg in 1887, who then began selling the stone across the southwest \u2013 after he made a successful sale in California that expanded the business, he was replaced in 1888 by a master quarryman. While it was used as building material across the West, some of Flagstaff's most prominent buildings are famous for the stone, including the Bank Hotel,<ref name=\":22\" /> Weatherford Hotel, Babbitt Brothers Building, Coconino County Courthouse,<ref name=\"themetown\" /> and various NAU buildings, including Old Main.<ref name=\":22\" />\n\nIn the 1960s, the geology of the Flagstaff area, including formations like Meteor Crater, was seen as similar to environments that would be encountered on the Moon in terms of [[planetary geology]]. The [[Astrogeology Research Program]] was therefore moved to Flagstaff in 1962, with the program completing in 1963, to train astronauts.<ref name=\"Rocky Moon 1993\">{{cite web|url=http://www.lpi.usra.edu/publications/books/rockyMoon/|title=To a Rocky Moon: A Geologist's History of Lunar Exploration|last=Wilhelms|first=Don|date=1993}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|last=Vaughan|first=R.

During the 20th century, the springs had been modified and sequestered to provide water for the city and for different private owners, with underground pipes particularly reducing the flow.

Other surfaces also affect the river. The soil of the [[drainage basin]] of the river absorbs moisture, allowing a slow release into the river of naturally filtered water, but fires in the area can damage this soil. Within the urban areas, non-absorbent surfaces mean that unfiltered rainwater is entering the river, which can contain pollutants poisonous to fish.<ref name=\":16\" />\n\nBefore meeting the Little Colorado, the river has a [[confluence]] with Walnut Creek.<ref name=\":21\" /> The river did not always run its current course through the city, as during the 20th century it was rerouted in certain areas to allow urban expansion and as a means of flood control.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www2.nau.edu/~gaud/RiodeFlag/rdf_fldctrl.htm|title=Rio de Flag: Flood Control|website=www2.nau.edu|access-date=2020-04-07}}</ref> In 2020, $52 million was awarded to Flagstaff to finish the Rio de Flag Flood Control Project, with Arizona Senator [[Kyrsten Sinema]] visiting the project.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sinema.senate.gov/sinema-tours-rio-de-flag-flood-control-project-flagstaff-leaders|title=Sinema Tours Rio de Flag Flood Control Project with Flagstaff Leaders|website=Senator Kyrsten Sinema|language=en|access-date=2020-04-07}}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1890= 964\n|1900= 1271\n|1910= 1633\n|1920= 3186\n|1930= 3891\n|1940= 5080\n|1950= 7663\n|1960= 18214\n|1970= 26117\n|1980= 34743\n|1990= 45857\n|2000= 52894\n|2010= 65870\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=73964\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=June 4, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2016}}</ref>\n}}\n\nAccording to the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], the population of the city was 65,870.<ref name=\"Census Quickfacts\">{{cite web|url=http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/04/0423620.html |title=Flagstaff (city) QuickFacts from the US Census Bureau |publisher=Quickfacts.census.gov |accessdate=January 20, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120606015816/http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/04/0423620.html |archivedate=June 6, 2012 }}</ref> The population density was 831.9 people per square mile (321.2/km\u00b2).

In 2018, the city's estimated population was 73,964. Flagstaff's combined metropolitan area has an estimated population of 139,097.\n\nFlagstaff lies near the southwestern edge of the [[Colorado Plateau]] and within the [[San Francisco volcanic field]], along the western side of the largest contiguous [[Pinus ponderosa|ponderosa pine]] forest in the continental United States. The city sits at around {{convert|7000|ft}} and is next to [[Mount Elden]], just south of the [[San Francisco Peaks]], the highest mountain range in the state of Arizona. [[Humphreys Peak]], the highest point in Arizona at {{convert|12633|ft}}, is about {{convert|10|mi|km}} north of Flagstaff in [[Kachina Peaks Wilderness]]. The geology of the Flagstaff area includes exposed rock from the [[Mesozoic]] and [[Paleozoic]] eras, with [[Moenkopi Formation]] red sandstone having once been quarried in the city; many of the historic downtown buildings were constructed with it. The Rio de Flag river runs through the city.\n\nOriginally settled by the [[pre-Columbian]] native [[Sinagua]] people, the area of Flagstaff has fertile land from volcanic ash after eruptions in the 11th century. It was first settled as the present-day city in 1876. The early economy was based on the [[lumber]], railroad, and [[ranching]] industries, and was dominated by the McMillan, Riordan, and Babbitt families. It was also selected as the location for the [[Lowell Observatory]] due to its altitude, from which [[Pluto]] was discovered. The Riordans and Babbitts lobbied for [[U.S. Route 66|Route 66]] to pass through the city, which it did, turning the local industry to tourism and developing downtown Flagstaff; though it brought [[Okie]]s to the city during the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]], Route 66 also presented funding opportunities that ultimately improved the economy in the early 1930s. The city developed further through to the end of the 1960s, with various observatories also used to choose [[Moon landing]] sites for the [[List of Apollo missions|Apollo missions]]. Through the 1970s and '80s, downtown fell into disrepair, but was revitalized with a major cultural heritage project in the 1990s.\n\nThe city remains an important distribution hub for companies such as [[Nestl\u00e9 Purina PetCare]], and is home to the [[United States Naval Observatory Flagstaff Station|U.S. Naval Observatory Flagstaff Station]], the [[United States Geological Survey]] Flagstaff Station, and [[Northern Arizona University]]. Flagstaff has a strong tourism sector, due to its proximity to [[Grand Canyon National Park]], [[Oak Creek Canyon]], the [[Arizona Snowbowl]], [[Meteor Crater]], and [[U.S. Route 66 in Arizona#Historic Route 66|Historic Route 66]].\n\n==History==\n=== Early settlements ===\n{{main|Sinagua|Tonto Apache|Yavapai}}\n{{multiple image\n| direction = vertical\n| align = left\n| total_width = 250\n| image1 = Elden Pueblo, 1926.jpg\n| caption1 = Elden Pueblo ruins in 1926\n| image2 = Wukoki Ruin.tif\n| caption2 = Wukoki ruins in 2008\n| image3 = Walnut Canyon National Monument 2015 026.jpg\n| caption3 = Cliff dwellings at Walnut Canyon in 2015\n| header = Different forms of pre-Columbian buildings in the Flagstaff area\n| alt1 = Black and white stone structure in front of trees\n| alt2 = Stone pueblo on shrubland\n| alt3 = Stone structure on side of rockface\n}}\nThe [[Sinagua]] people{{efn|Coined later from the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] for \"without water\" ([[wikt:sin#Spanish|sin]] and [[wikt:agua#Spanish|agua]]).<ref name=linoff>{{cite web|last1=Linoff|first1=Lindsay|title=The Sinagua People of Montezuma Castle|url=http://www.mesacc.edu/~thoqh49081/StudentPapers/sinagua.html|publisher=Mesa Community College|accessdate=17 November 2015|date=1998}}</ref>}} were a [[pre-Columbian]] culture that occupied a large area in Arizona from the [[Little Colorado River]], near Flagstaff, to the [[Verde River]], near [[Sedona, Arizona|Sedona]], including the [[Verde Valley]], area around the [[San Francisco Peaks]], and significant portions of the [[Mogollon Rim]] country,<ref name=logan>{{cite web|title=Sinagua|url=https://www.beloit.edu/logan_online/exhibitions/virtual_exhibitions/north_america/southwest/sinagua/sinagua.php|website=Logan Museum of Anthropology|publisher=Beloit College}}</ref><ref name=nau>{{cite web|title=The Sinagua|url=http://www2.nau.edu/d-antlab/Soutwestern%20Arch/Sinagua/sinagua.htm|publisher=Anthropology Laboratories of Northern Arizona University|accessdate=17 November 2015}}</ref> between approximately 500 [[Common Era|CE]] and 1425 CE.<ref name=gibbon>{{cite book|editor1-last=Gibbon|editor1-first=Guy|title=Archaeology of Prehistoric Native America: An Encyclopedia|date=1998|publisher=Taylor & Francis|location=New York|page=[https://archive.org/details/archaeologyofpre0000unse/page/770 770]|isbn=978-0815307259|url=https://archive.org/details/archaeologyofpre0000unse/page/770}}</ref> Christian E.

Route 66 had been supported by the businessmen of Flagstaff as early as 1912, knowing that the town was close to natural wonders that would make it a commercial opportunity, with the Babbitt family opening a car dealership.

As part of the celebrations, Front Street was renamed Santa Fe Avenue. In 1927, Flagstaff's primary industry was still timber, though farming persisted into the 1920s. The city produced the majority of Arizona's timber supply that year, and was economically powered by the competing Arizona Lumber and Timber and Flagstaff Lumber companies, but in the last years of the decade, tourism took over and the face of the main commercial district changed to diners and motels in place of saloons.<ref name=\":8\" /> In 1928 the [[Museum of Northern Arizona]] opened in the city, and in the same year its workers prevented the destruction of Sunset Crater for use in a movie explosion.<ref name=\":12\" /> \n\nAt the start of the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]], the massive expansion of Flagstaff and Coconino County during the 1920s was seen as likely unsustainable with a lower income. It was made worse by the [[Okie|unemployed workers]] traveling Route 66 to California stopping in Flagstaff, and young jobless Canadians venturing to the area for exploration having to be supported by the city before being deported. Southard wrote that the \"down-on-their-luck migrants taxed the resources of their host cities, while contributing little to the local economy\".<ref name=\":8\" /> Known as \"auto nomads\" in Flagstaff, out-of-work families relocating to the city with children were particularly taxing on the public school system, and even those that did not stay long became unpopular as they could not afford to buy gas or food.<ref name=\":8\" /> Flagstaff had also been highlighted on the map by [[Clyde Tombaugh]]'s 1930 discovery of [[Pluto]] from the Lowell Observatory; the planet was in part named for Percival Lowell (PL).<ref name=\"USNO\" /><ref name=\":12\" /> However, some Flagstaff residents attempted charitable endeavors, including setting up food banks and imploring hunters in the local area to donate a percentage of each kill to them. This did not last long, as in the winter of 1931\u201332, a rumor that California had closed its borders to [[Midwestern United States|Mid West]] migrants spread through Arizona, with people from places like Flagstaff and [[Yuma, Arizona|Yuma]], the last cities on major cross-country highways before California, demanding that Arizona be closed to migrants, too.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\nThe importance of Route 66 to cross-country travel, and thus to Arizona's interests on a national level, did mean that it received a large share of state funding through the Depression, though, with highway maintenance and unemployment acts providing over $1 million of funding in May 1933. Flagstaff's unemployed soon became highway construction workers, and by the end of 1934, Flagstaff had financially recovered to pre-Depression levels, aided by tax cuts and continued tourism; in 1935, many residents had enough disposable income to remodel their homes or build new ones. In 1936, based on the city's continued economic upswing, [[General Petroleum Corporation|General Petroleum]] announced it was building a new refinery just outside of town.<ref name=\":8\" /> The first hospital in the city was also opened in 1936, by Charles Sechrist.<ref name=\":12\" /> At the outbreak of [[World War II]], Route 66, now well- paved and maintained, was used to transport military outfits, bringing more prosperity to Flagstaff<ref name=\":8\" /> and doubling its population.<ref name=\":12\" />\n\n[[File:NOFS-pan2_(cropped).jpg|300px|left|thumb|The Naval Observatory during Dark Sky monitoring in 2008|alt=Building with starry night sky]]\nPeople from the city had created the first ski run in the mountains in 1938, using a family cabin;

The oldest rock types of the area are part of North America's original crust, [[Precambrian]] [[granite]] and [[schist]] from 1.7 to 1.8 billion years ago. On top of this is [[Paleozoic]] [[sandstone]], limestone, [[shale]] and [[siltstone]] deposited on what was then (544 to 248 million years ago) different surfaces, including a shallow seabed, muddy land, and sandy desert. The rock layers from this period are (bottom to top): [[Tapeats Sandstone]], [[Bright Angel Shale]] and [[Muav Limestone]], [[Martin Formation]], [[Redwall Limestone]], [[Supai Group]], [[Coconino Sandstone]], [[Toroweap Formation]], and [[Kaibab Limestone]]. The last three of these are still exposed. On top of the Paleozoic rock is [[Mesozoic]] Moenkopi Formation, from 248 to 65 million years ago. Other Mesozoic layers formed on top of this, but were eroded away. In the Flagstaff area, layers of rock from the Paleozoic and Mesozoic eras accumulated up to {{Convert|10000|ft|m}} deep, but most of this was eroded.<ref name=\":23\">{{Cite book|last=Bezy|first=John V.|url=https://friendsoftheriodeflag.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Bezy-J.V.-2003-A-guide-to-the-geologt-of-the-Flagstaff-area.-Arizona-Geological-Survey.pdf|title=A guide to the geology of the Flagstaff area|publisher=Arizona Geological Survey|year=2003|isbn=1-892001-17-9|location=Tucson, AZ|oclc=53701547}}</ref> A soft basalt layer covers some of the rock at the surface.<ref name=\":23\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www2.nau.edu/~gaud/RiodeFlag/rdf_geology.htm|title=Rio de Flag: Geology|website=www2.nau.edu|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[Laramide orogeny]], which began about 65\u201375 million years ago, the [[Western United States]] underwent stress in rock formation; in the [[Four Corners]] region this pushed up the preexisting layers and ultimately formed the Colorado Plateau (and the [[Rocky Mountains]]). Around Flagstaff more specifically, this process deformed flat rock layers into folds, and allowed surface rivers to cut deep canyons in the younger rock layers. From about 25 million years ago, more [[Fault (geology)|faults]] were broken again in Flagstaff, and volcanic activity began about 6 million years ago with [[magma]] flowing up these faults to create [[Lava|lava flows]]. [[Types of volcanic eruptions|Eruptions]] occurred between 3 million and 1,000 years ago, affecting the Paleozoic and Mesozoic rocks.<ref name=\":23\" />\n\n[[File:SanFranciscoPeaks.ASTER,20031021.jpg|thumb|left|Flagstaff and surrounding volcanic formations; image from [[United States Geological Survey|USGS]] made using [[Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer|ASTER]] data|alt=Isometric topographic map]]\nThe San Francisco [[stratovolcano]] shape was formed by [[glacial ice]] movements occurring over the past 1.8 million years, and the mountains formed through various geologic activity between 2.8 million and 220,000 years ago, finishing when the Sugarloaf of the Inner Basin formed. The stratovolcano is predominantly formed of [[andesite]]; stratovolcanoes are more commonly found in [[Ring of Fire|highly volatile areas around the Pacific]]. It contains various features of glaciation. Mount Elden is a [[lava dome]] made of [[dacite]]. Sunset Crater and [[S P Crater]] are much geologically younger and have not been weathered very much; Sunset Crater is the youngest feature of the San Francisco volcanic field and formed in the last 1,000 years. S P Crater was formed between 75,000 and 70,000 years ago by piles of [[lapilli]] and [[volcanic bombs]] spouting from a [[lava lake]], while Sunset Crater's formation was an [[explosive eruption]].<ref name=\":23\" /> \n\nMoenkopi Formation red sandstone is a distinctive feature of Flagstaff, as it was used as a building material from the 1880s because of its fire retardant properties. The source used for quarrying most of this rock was a deposit 1 mile east of the town, which fell under the control of Charles Begg in 1887, who then began selling the stone across the southwest \u2013 after he made a successful sale in California that expanded the business, he was replaced in 1888 by a master quarryman.

Other surfaces also affect the river. The soil of the [[drainage basin]] of the river absorbs moisture, allowing a slow release into the river of naturally filtered water, but fires in the area can damage this soil.
