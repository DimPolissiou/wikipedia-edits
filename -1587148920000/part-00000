In 1953, the [[Marlon Brando]] film ''[[The Wild One]]'' appeared, and some butch gays began to imitate Brando by wearing black leather jackets, a black leather cap, black leather boots and jeans and, if they could afford it, by also riding [[motorcycles]].<ref name=\"ebar.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ebar.com/artscolumns/artcolumn.php?sec=leather |title=Bay Area Reporter | volume= 40 No. 44--4 November 2010 |page=Page 31 Scott Brogan leather column |publisher=Ebar.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-18}}</ref> In the 1950s, the magazine ''[[Bizarre (fetish magazine)|Bizarre]]'' familiarized people with [[sexual fetishism]].\n\n==History of the leather community in San Francisco==\n[[File:Ty LeBeouf, CJ Knight and Alex Collack.jpg|thumb|160px|Men wearing leather clothing at the Fair, 2007]]\n\nThe first proto-leather bar in San Francisco was the Sailor Boy Tavern, which opened in 1938 near the Embarcadero YMCA and catered to [[U.S. Navy]] infantry looking for same-sex sexual encounters.<ref name=\"ebar.com\"/>\n\nFolsom Street has been the center of San Francisco's men's leather community since the mid-1960s. Before centering in the [[South of Market]] neighborhood, leather friendly bars were located in the [[The Embarcadero (San Francisco)|Embarcadero]] (Jack's On The Waterfront at 111 Embarcadero 1952-1963, On The Levee ?-1972), and the [[Tenderloin, San Francisco, California|Tenderloin]] (The Spur Club at 126 Turk - raided and closed in 1959, The Why Not at 518 Ellis - opened and closed in 1960, The Hideaway at 438 Eddy - raided and closed in 1961).

[[The Stud (bar)|The Stud]] bar, which opened in 1966 at 1535 Folsom St., was a gay leather bar that was also originally a [[Hells Angels|Hell's Angels]] hangout; by 1969 it had become a [[dance bar]] for [[hippie]]s on the margins of the leather scene and had a [[Psychedelic art|psychedelic black light mural]] by [[Chuck Arnett]] (in 1987, it moved to 399 9th St. at Harrison). In 1967 A Taste of Leather, one of the first in-bar leather stores, was established at Febe's by Nick O'Demus. As of late 2009, A Taste of Leather announced it would be going out of business after 43 years.\n\nIn 1971, the modern [[Handkerchief code|bandana code]] came into use among leather people. Many leather people went to the Embarcadero [[YMCA]] (at this YMCA, doing [[weight training]] while wearing nothing but [[gym shoes]] and a [[jockstrap]] as well as [[nude swimming]] were both allowed until 1975, when women could become members of the YMCA). Leather people who worked out at the Embarcadero YMCA took advantage of the opportunity to get together with [[sailor]]s when they came into town and rented rooms at the adjacent Embarcadero [[YMCA Hotel (San Francisco, California)|YMCA Hotel]].\n\n[[File:Woman whipped at Folsom Street Fair 2010.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Sex and torture acts done at public BDSM events, like Folsom Street Fair, have been accused of being against the law, even when the events are promoted by the local administration and police, and all acts are done with consent.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/san-francisco-s-folsom-street-fair-featured-public-whippings|title=San Francisco's Folsom Street Fair Featured Public Whippings|author=|date=29 September 2008|work=CNS News|accessdate=3 July 2017}}</ref> Photo shows a submissive woman [[bondage (BDSM)|bound]] to [[Saint Andrew's Cross (BDSM)|Saint Andrew's Cross]] whipped at Folsom Street Fair 2010.

These establishments included, in the order they were established:  1968 - Off the Levee (by the same owner of On The Levee), The Ramrod.  1971 - The In Between (later renamed The No Name), The Bootcamp.  1972 - The Barracks at 72 Hallam St., off Folsom between 7th and 8th Streets (a [[gay bathhouse]] for people into hardcore BDSM\u2014each room was arranged like a stage set to cater to a different [[sex fetish|fetish]] [[sex fantasy|fantasy]]). 1973 - The Red Star Saloon (connected to the Barracks) (which featured new artwork by Chuck Arnett), the [[End Up]] (not a leather bar but a dance bar; however, many leather people who liked to dance went there), Folsom Prison, The Ambush, Big Town\u2014a gay leather [[shopping mall]] on the south side of Folsom between 6th and 7th Streets. 1975 - Hombre, The [[Catacombs (fisting club)|Catacombs]] (for those into hard core [[fisting]]), The Emporium.  1976 - The Trading Post, The Slot (for those into hardcore [[flagellation]]), The Hotel (later renamed The Handball Express\u2014a place for those into hardcore fisting).  1977 - The Brig, The Balcony.  1978 - The Arena, The Roundup (later renamed The Watering Hole\u2014a place for those into [[urolagnia]]), The Quarters, Black & Blue, Folsom Street Baths at 1015 Folsom (a BDSM gay bathhouse, later renamed The Sutro Baths in 1980\u2014the slogan of the Sutro Baths was \"A [[rainbow]] of [[Sexual orientation|sexual preferences]]\", which was inscribed on a banner above the orgy room, located where the main dance floor of 1015 Folsom now is. The Sutro Baths also admitted women and [[transsexual]]s).  1979 - The Stables at 1123 Folsom (for those who liked to dress as [[cowboy]]s), The Trench (for those into hardcore [[urolagnia]]), The Hothouse on the northwest corner of 5th and Harrison (another BDSM gay bathhouse), Tailor of San Francisco, Mister S Leathers.  1980 - The Plunge\u2014a gay BDSM bathhouse with a [[swimming pool]] on the northwest corner of 11th and Folsom (in 1983 the swimming pool was covered over and became the surface of the dance floor of the popular [[bisexual]] dance club The Oasis).  1981 - The Eagle at 398 12th St., as of 2010, was San Francisco's oldest leather bar, as well as its largest with its extensive outdoor patio, and it hosted many popular barbecues and [[beer bust]]s to benefit charitable organizations; however, it closed in June 2011 due to a dispute over its real estate. The Eagle has subsequently reopened in 2013.\n\nThe predecessor of the Folsom Street Fair was the ''CMC Carnival'' (''California Motorcycle Club Carnival''), a gay leather BDSM dance (with [[DJ]]s and a [[rock band]]) and fair, with vendors and a back room for [[casual sex]]. It was held on the second Sunday of November every year from 1966 to the last one in 1986 at various indoor venues including most often at the Seafarer's International Union Hall (referred to as ''Seaman's Hall'' for short) at 350 Fremont Street in the Embarcadero area of SOMA. In the early 1970s, the CMC Carnival was attended by a few hundred people and by the time of the last large CMC Carnival in 1982 at what was then the Yellow Cab Building at Jones and Turk in the Tenderloin, it was attended by over 4,000 people.<ref>For the history of the ''CMC Carnival'', see Mr. Marcus' leather column in the November back issues of the ''[[Bay Area Reporter]]'', available at the San Francisco Main Library at 100 Larkin St.</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.leatherarchives.org/exhibits/deblase/timeline1.htm#1966 |title=Leather History Timeline-Leather Archives |publisher=Leatherarchives.org |date= |accessdate=2012-05-18 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120421175041/http://www.leatherarchives.org/exhibits/deblase/timeline1.htm#1966 |archivedate=2012-04-21 |df= }}</ref>\n\nThe \"CMC Carnival\" was organized by one of the leather [[motorcycle club]]s, the ''California Motorcycle Club'', with the help of other gay motorcycle clubs. The members of these gay motorcycle clubs rode mostly [[Harley Davidson]] [[motorcycle]]s and on periodic weekends rode their motorcycles to outings at picnic grounds in the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]]. The first gay motorcycle club in the United States was the Satyrs, founded in Los Angeles in 1954. The first gay motorcycle club in San Francisco was the Warlocks, which was founded in 1960, followed by the California Motorcycle Club, also founded in 1960 later in the year. By the mid-1960s, San Francisco's South of Market district had become the center of the gay motorcycle club scene and was home to motorcycle clubs such as the Barbary Coasters (founded in 1966) and the Constantines and the Cheaters (both founded in 1967).<ref name=\"sgn.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.sgn.org/sgnnews34_49/page30.cfm |title=Past Out by Liz Highleyman-''Seattle Gay News'' Friday December 8, 2006 Volume 34 Issue 49\u2014\"History of the Gay Motorcycle Clubs\" |publisher=Sgn.org |date=2006-12-08 |accessdate=2012-05-18}}</ref>\n\nThese gay motorcycle clubs also organized many benefits for [[charitable organization|charity]] at various leather bars. During the 1970s and early 1980s one could see many dozens of motorcycles belonging to people who were members of these clubs parked up and down the length of Folsom Street on the ''Miracle Mile''.

City officials had wanted to \"revitalize\" the historically blue collar, warehouse, industrial district by continuing successful high rise development already underway on [[Rincon Hill]].\n\nBut as the AIDS epidemic unfolded in the 1980s, the community's relative autonomy from City Hall was dramatically weakened. The crisis became an opportunity for the city (in the name of [[public health]]) to close [[gay bathhouse|bathhouses]] and regulate bars, which they did beginning in 1984.<ref name=\"Rubin, Gayle 1998\">Rubin, Gayle. \"The Miracle Mile: South of Market and Gay Male Leather, 1962-1997\" in ''Reclaiming San Francisco: History, Politics, Culture'' (City Light Books, 1998).</ref>\n\nAs these establishments for the leather community were rapidly closing, a coalition of housing activists and community organizers decided to start a street fair. The fair would enhance the visibility of the community, provide a means for much-needed fundraising, and create opportunities for members of the leather community to connect to services and vital information (e.g., regarding [[safe sex|safer sex]]) that bathhouses and bars might otherwise have been situated to distribute.<ref name=\"Rubin, Gayle 1998\"/>\n\nThanks to the success of the first Folsom Street Fair, the organizers created the [[Up Your Alley Fair]] on Ringold Street in 1985.

As of late 2009, A Taste of Leather announced it would be going out of business after 43 years.\n\nIn 1971, the modern [[Handkerchief code|bandana code]] came into use among leather people. Many leather people went to the Embarcadero [[YMCA]] (at this YMCA, doing [[weight training]] while wearing nothing but [[gym shoes]] and a [[jockstrap]] as well as [[nude swimming]] were both allowed until 1975, when women could become members of the YMCA).

It was held on the second Sunday of November every year from 1966 to the last one in 1986 at various indoor venues including most often at the Seafarer's International Union Hall (referred to as ''Seaman's Hall'' for short) at 350 Fremont Street in the Embarcadero area of SOMA. In the early 1970s, the CMC Carnival was attended by a few hundred people and by the time of the last large CMC Carnival in 1982 at what was then the Yellow Cab Building at Jones and Turk in the Tenderloin, it was attended by over 4,000 people.<ref>For the history of the ''CMC Carnival'', see Mr. Marcus' leather column in the November back issues of the ''[[Bay Area Reporter]]'', available at the San Francisco Main Library at 100 Larkin St.</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.leatherarchives.org/exhibits/deblase/timeline1.htm#1966 |title=Leather History Timeline-Leather Archives |publisher=Leatherarchives.org |date= |accessdate=2012-05-18 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120421175041/http://www.leatherarchives.org/exhibits/deblase/timeline1.htm#1966 |archivedate=2012-04-21 |df= }}</ref>\n\nThe \"CMC Carnival\" was organized by one of the leather [[motorcycle club]]s, the ''California Motorcycle Club'', with the help of other gay motorcycle clubs.

The first gay motorcycle club in the United States was the Satyrs, founded in Los Angeles in 1954. The first gay motorcycle club in San Francisco was the Warlocks, which was founded in 1960, followed by the California Motorcycle Club, also founded in 1960 later in the year. By the mid-1960s, San Francisco's South of Market district had become the center of the gay motorcycle club scene and was home to motorcycle clubs such as the Barbary Coasters (founded in 1966) and the Constantines and the Cheaters (both founded in 1967).<ref name=\"sgn.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.sgn.org/sgnnews34_49/page30.cfm |title=Past Out by Liz Highleyman-''Seattle Gay News'' Friday December 8, 2006 Volume 34 Issue 49\u2014\"History of the Gay Motorcycle Clubs\" |publisher=Sgn.org |date=2006-12-08 |accessdate=2012-05-18}}</ref>\n\nThese gay motorcycle clubs also organized many benefits for [[charitable organization|charity]] at various leather bars.

City officials had wanted to \"revitalize\" the historically blue collar, warehouse, industrial district by continuing successful high rise development already underway on [[Rincon Hill]].\n\nBut as the AIDS epidemic unfolded in the 1980s, the community's relative autonomy from City Hall was dramatically weakened. The crisis became an opportunity for the city (in the name of [[public health]]) to close [[gay bathhouse|bathhouses]] and regulate bars, which they did beginning in 1984.<ref name=\"Rubin, Gayle 1998\">Rubin, Gayle. \"The Miracle Mile: South of Market and Gay Male Leather, 1962-1997\" in ''Reclaiming San Francisco: History, Politics, Culture'' (City Light Books, 1998).</ref>\n\nAs these establishments for the leather community were rapidly closing, a coalition of housing activists and community organizers decided to start a street fair. The fair would enhance the visibility of the community, provide a means for much-needed fundraising, and create opportunities for members of the leather community to connect to services and vital information (e.g., regarding [[safe sex|safer sex]]) that bathhouses and bars might otherwise have been situated to distribute.<ref name=\"Rubin, Gayle 1998\"/>\n\nThanks to the success of the first Folsom Street Fair, the organizers created the [[Up Your Alley Fair]] on Ringold Street in 1985.

It was founded in 1823 and located in the former Palace of the Inquisition in [[Mexico City]]. Initially designated as the ''Cadet Academy'' it was renamed in 1823 as the ''Colegio Militar''. The College was relocated in Perote, [[Veracruz]], before being returned to Mexico City where it was established in the Betlemitas monastery (today occupied by the Interactive Museum of the Economy and the Museum of the Mexican Army and Air Force).  From 1835 the Military College was located in the Recogidas Building (destroyed by an earthquake in 1985). Cadets training for the Mexican Navy originally formed part of the student body but in 1897 the [[Heroica Escuela Naval Militar|Military Naval School]] was established as a separate institution in [[Veracruz]].\n\nThe Military College comes under the supervision of the [[Mexican Army and Air Force University]] and the Army Military Education General Directorate.\n\n== History of the College ==\n\n===Foundation===\nAlthough plans for a military academy were proposed as early as 1818, it would be only in 1822 when such plans materialized, with the efforts of Diego Garcia Conde, the ex-Spanish military officer then serving in the [[Mexican Army]], for such an academy to be formed were approved by the Mexican Imperial Government, through the Imperial War Ministry.\n\nIn the middle of the year, Emperor [[Agustin de Iturbide]] ordered that the  Former Inquisition Palace Complex become the headquarters of the now newly founded Military College of Mexico, the Military Cadet Academy and the Engineers Training School, all under their first director, Brigadier Diego Garcia Conde. By the next year, through the orders of War Minister General Jose Joaquin de Herrera, the  Military College of Mexico was relaunched as a separate academy with headquarters at [[San Carlos Fortress]], in [[Perote, Veracruz]] state. In 1824, in compliance with an order from [[President of Mexico|President]] [[Guadalupe Victoria]], 18 cadets of the now called ''Perote Military College of Mexico'', through the permission of then college director Col. Juan Dominguez y Galvez,  became the first cadets of the new ''Naval Aspirants College'' and the ''Tlacotalpan Nautical School'' trained to be the [[Mexican Navy]]'s future ship officers.\n\n===Early years===\n[[File:Mexican cadet.jpg|thumb|250px|right|A cadet of the Heroic Military Academy (Mexico) with a [[golden eagle]], the academy mascot.]]\n[[File:Mujereshcm.JPG|thumb|250px|right|Another cadet holding the golden eagle mascot. A female cadet stands in the foreground. Both wear the gala uniform of the Cadet Corps]]\nIn 1828, due to a campaign against [[Secret society|secret societies]] and [[Freemasonry|masonic lodges]], Lt. Col. Manuel Montano's visit became the reason for the College's first loyalty act by the Corps of Cadets and its faculty, for their response to him was that the Military College should be exempted from the campaign due to the fact that no one in the College's cadet rosters were either secret society members nor Masons, and it turned into a national act of loyalty by the college cadets and faculty. As a result of this great deed, the College in March 1828 returned to Mexico City, first in the Bethelemitas convent and later in the Inquisition Palace Complex on July 1. By then, it began to be recognized by every Mexican as the nation's premier military educational institution.\n\nThe turmoil that sparked in the 1828 presidential elections took its toll on the College cadets. On September 11, a rebellion led by Generals [[Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna|Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna]] and Jose Maria Lobato  denounced the election results ten days before, in which Manuel Gomez Pedraza emerged as the winner. Two months later, on November 30, they together with Lorenzo de Zavala and Col. Santiago Garcia staged a coup d'\u00e9tat that took over the La {{Not a typo|Acordada}} building demanding that the election results be voided by Congress. The same day, President Victoria called on the College cadets to proceed to the National Palace, and they fought on the side of the armed forces for 4 days until the fighting ended on December 4, with a compromise reached by both sides. Class would resume later the next day.\n\nPolitical turmoil broke out again in 1840. On July 13 of that year Gen. [[Jose Urrea]] bolted out of jail and led a rebellion against President Anastacio Bustamante, who was later imprisoned in the presidential residence. General Gabriel Valencia then ordered all troops loyal to the President to proceed at once to the city citadel. These included the cadets of the Military College under its then director Brigade General Pedro Conde, who was received by Gen. Valencia and sent a delegation of cadets to the citadel. The College delegation then moved to a church where they fought anti-Bustamante troops, which resulted in two wounded cadets (Juan Rico and Antonio Groso), the former would later die of his wounds sustained. On the 16th President Bustamante left his residence and Gen. Vicente Filisola arrived at the church premises. On that night, when an armistice was made, the attempted coup was already over.\n\nThe next year, it relocated to the Chalpultepec Castle in Mexico City. This castle would be, in 6 years time, during the Mexican War, a place where 5 cadets and an officer in the faculty died in defense of the Mexican nation, and it would gain the ''Heroic'' designation. After a few years, the College relocated to the Inquisition Palace and later to San Lucas.\n\nIn 1846, the College's only naval director, Graduate Ship Captain Francisco Garcia began his duties as College Commandant, a duty lasting until 1847. A sudden rebellion by the Corps of Cadets happened during his tenure.\n\n===The Ni\u00f1os H\u00e9roes===\nThe following year (1847), during the first term of Col. Jos\u00e9 Mariano Monterde Segura as commandant, the [[Mexican\u2013American War]] reached Mexico City and the Military Academy. On September 11 cadets of the Academy were involved in fighting on the Condress Estate.  On September 13 Chapultepec Castle and its surroundings became the site of the historic [[Battle of Chapultepec]]. Its Mexican Army defenders, under the leadership of [[Nicol\u00e1s Bravo]], former President and a veteran of the war of independence, included about 200 members of the Corps of Cadets, aged between 13 and 19. At the end of the battle five cadets -  Juan Escutia (who reportedly leapt to his death wrapped in the [[Flag of Mexico]]), Agustin Melgar, Francisco Marquez, Fernando Montes de Oca, and Vicente Su\u00e1rez; plus faculty member Lieutenant of Juan de la Barrera - all refused to retreat and died in a final stand as the \"young heroes\" of Academy legend. An unknown proportion of the other cadets became casualties or prisoners during the earlier stages of the battle.\n\nEach year on the anniversary of the battle, the sacrifice of the five [[Ni\u00f1os H\u00e9roes]] of the Military Academy is remembered nationwide, with a national ceremony at the monument with the Corps in attendance.\n\n===1857\u20131920===\nIn 1858, during the term of Commandant Colonel Luis Tola Algar\u00edn, the College moved its facilities to the former Church of Sts. Peter and Paul in Mexico City.  During the [[Reform War]] the same year the Corps of Cadets was involved in a clash with the forces of Gen. Miguel Blanco on October 15 in [[Toluca]]. Casualties suffered by the cadets and instructors in this and subsequent actions caused the closure of the College in 1861.\n\nThe College was reopened in 1867. Located first in the [[National Palace (Mexico)|National Palace]] the College was moved to various locations before returning to the Chapultepec Castle in 1882. Formerly a joint services institution, the College became an academy for the Mexican Army only in 1897, following the establishment of the Military Naval School in Veracruz.\n\nOn 8 February 1913 the 600 cadets of the Military College played a part in the coup known as The [[Ten Tragic Days]] against President [[Francisco Madero]].<ref>Ronald Atkin, page 126 \"Revolution! Mexico 1910-20\", Granada Publishing Ltd. 1973</ref> Cadets of the separate ''Escuela Militar de Aspirantes de Tlalpan'' (established in 1905 as an additional academy for training junior officers) had joined with regular army units in an ultimately successful attempt to overthrow Madero. However a detachment of cadets from the Heroic Military College, acting on the orders of Deputy Commandant Lieutenant Colonel V\u00edctor Hern\u00e1ndez Covarrubias  escorted President Madero from Chapultepec Castle to the National Palace on the following day. Termed the ''Loyalty March'', this action is still marked by an annual parade by the Corps of Cadets, attended by the present-day [[President of Mexico]] and his Cabinet.\n\nThe new government down-graded the role of the Heroic Military College, briefly merging its functions with those of the ''Escuela Militar de Aspirantes de Tlalpan'' and accelerating the training of cadets from both academies to reinforce the crumbling Federal Army. Following the overthrow of General [[Victoriano Huerta]] in July 1914 and the disbandment of the Federal Army, the College was closed. It was reestablished in February 1920 albelt in a new campus in Popotla, Mexico City. Later that spring the then reestablished cavalry squadron were involved in what has been termed \"the final cavalry charge in the Americas\". This occurred on May 8, when on the orders of Colonel Rodolfo Casillas the cadets acted in support of regular army dragoons led by General Pilar Sanchez under attack by rebel forces in Apizaco, Tlaxcala. In another engagement two days later a cadet was killed in action in San Marcos while supporting government forces.\n\n==The College from 1947 to today==\n[[File:Desfile Militar Conmemorativo del CCV Aniversario del Inicio de la Independencia de M\u00e9xico. (21286670090).jpg|thumb|A cadet of the Heroic Military Academy with a [[golden eagle]] during a parade in 2015.]]\nIn 1947 The Military College celebrated the centenary of the Corps of Cadets' participation in the Battle of Chapultepec, the finest hour of its history.  In 1949, the [[Congress of the Union]] formally conferred the \"Heroic\" designation to both the Corps and to the Midshipmen's Battalion of the Naval Military Academy, the latter for its role in resisting the [[United States occupation of Veracruz]] in 1914.\n\nTo celebrate the 150th anniversary of the Heroic Military College (1820-1970), 1 oz silver coins were minted by the Central Bank. In addition stamps featuring two Military College [[shako]]s were printed by the Government of Mexico. A special issue of stamps also commemorated the Golden Jubilee of \"the final cavalry charge in the Americas\"; carried out by the cavalry cadets of the college in 1920 (see above).\n\nIn 1976, the College's present campus in [[Tlalpan]] Borough, [[Mexico City]], was formally opened, partially damaged by the 1985 earthquake that struck the city. Today, the commandant of the academy is Brigade General Julio \u00c1lvarez Arellano.\n\nThe school was used as a setting for [[Luis Miguel]]'s 1989 music video \"[[La Incondicional]]\". In the video he plays an Air Force cadet who is in love, but he must take his stuides as soldier seriously. In a marching scene towards the end of the song one can see the \"Por el Honor de Mexico\" banner.\n\nPerote, the second home of the Military College, has been dubbed by the Veracruz State Congress as ''The Cradle of the Military College'' since 2002.\n\nFrom 2007, the academy has accepted female cadets. The present Corps is regiment-sized and has among its units a cavalry squadron and an artillery battery, plus an armored cavalry training squadron raised recently - a first in a military academy in Latin America.\n\n== Motto and Collegiate Slogan ==\n''Por el Honor de Mexico'' (''For Mexico's Honor'') is the college motto, made in a contest organized by radio station XEQ in commemoration of the centenary of the defense of Chalpultepec Castle in 1947.\n\nEvery midday, after the afternoon ceremony and before the midday parade, the following cheer is done by the Corps of Cadets:\n\n* Cadet Corps Commander: \"Heroico Colegio Militar\" (\"Heroic Military College\")\n* Cadets: ''Por el Honor de Mexico!'' (''For Mexico's Honor!'')\n\n== Collegiate Hymn and March ==\n\n=== Hymn of the Heroic Military College ===\n[[File:Ceremonia_en_Her\u00f3ico_Colegio_Militar.JPG|thumb|350px|right|A military parade part of a ceremony on Heroico Colegio Militar at Tlalpan, Mexico City.]]\n[[File:Colegio_mil.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Military College]]\nThe Hymn of the Heroic Military College was composed in 1930 by Prof. Jos\u00e9 Ignacio R\u00edos del R\u00edo.<ref name=\"sedena.gob.mx\">http://www.sedena.gob.mx/index.php?id=234</ref>\n\n===Lyrics===\n'''Spanish'''<br />\n''Chorus'' <br />\nVibre el clar\u00edn de la guerra, resuenen las fanfarrias<br />\nRedoblen los tambores, una marcha triunfal<br />\nY lleven de la Patria a todos los confines<br />\nTu nombre sacrosanto,<br /> \nColegio Militar<br />\nTu nombre sacrosanto,<br /> \nColegio Militar\n\n''Verse<br />\nColegio sacrosanto, de memoria bendita<br />\nde forjaran sus almas, Montes de Oca y Melgar<br />\nLa Patria bate marcha de honor a tu pasado,<br />\nde epopeyas gloriosas y de nombre inmortal.\n\nY en un gesto sublime de amor y de cari\u00f1o,<br />\nbendice a los efebos que supieron morir <br />\nba\u00f1ados por las r\u00e1fagas de luz espendorosa<br />\nque el \u00e1ngel de la gloria enviara del cenit.\n\n''Repeat Chorus''\n\n=== Regimental March of the Heroic Military College ===\nThe Regimental March was composed by Lieutenant Jos\u00e9 Sotero Ortiz S\u00e1nchez, in time for the College's 1947 centenary of the Battle of Chapultepec.\n\n===Lyrics===\n[[File:Escolta_hcm.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Listen hcm]]\n'''Spanish'''<br />\nP\u00e1ginas del libro de la historia del Heroico Colegio Militar<br />\nde epopeyas que ya jam\u00e1s se borran del santuario de la inmortalidad.<br />\nCanto que se eleva a la memoria como ofrenda de honor a la lealtad <br />\nde los h\u00e9roes que envueltos por la gloria grandioso ejemplo que nos dio la libertad. <br />\n''Repeat All''\n\nJuventud de mi patria sublime, que march\u00e1is con gallarda ilusi\u00f3n<br /> \naument\u00e1reis la historia que escribe nobles hechos de sangre y honor.<br /> \nYunque forjador de hombres de guerra como Su\u00e1rez, Escutia y Melgar,<br />\nMontes de Oca, M\u00e1rquez y De la Barrera, los ni\u00f1os h\u00e9roes de mi M\u00e9xico inmortal!<br />\n''Repeat All''\n\n== Commandants ==\n<ref>[http://www.sedena.gob.mx/index.php/educacion-militar/planteles-militares/heroico-colegio-militar/historia-hcm/directores-hcm Directores del Heroico Colegio Militar], [[Secretariat of National Defense (Mexico)]] (SEDENA)</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!No.!!Period!!Rank!!!!Notes\n|-\n|1||1818\u20131823||Brigadier General||[[Diego Garc\u00eda Conde]]||\n|-\n|2||1823\u20131824||Cavalry Colonel||[[Juan Dom\u00ednguez y G\u00e1lvez]]||\n|-\n|3||1825\u20131828||Cavalry Lieutenant Colonel||[[Jos\u00e9 Manuel Arechaga]]||\n|-\n|4||1835\u20131836||Engineers Colonel||[[Ignacio Mora y Villamil]]||\n|-\n|5||1836\u20131846||Brigadier General||[[Pedro Garc\u00eda Conde]]\n|-\n|6||1846\u20131847||Graduate Captain, Commander||[[Francisco Garc\u00eda Salinas]]||Only naval officer commandant of the College\n|-\n|7||1847\u20131853||Graduate Gen., Engineers Colonel||[[Jos\u00e9 Mariano Monterde Segura]]||Led the defense of [[Chapultepec Castle]] during the [[Battle of Chapultepec]] which took a heavy toll for the Academy\n|-\n|8||1853\u20131854||Graduate Gen., Engineers Colonel||[[Santiago Blanco Duque de Estrada]]||\n|-\n|9||1854\u20131859||Graduate Gen., Engineers Colonel||[[Luis Tola Algar\u00edn]]||\n|-\n|10||1859\u20131860||Engineers Colonel (Staff)||Jos\u00e9 Mariano Monterde Segura||2nd Period\n|-\n|11||1861\u20131863||Brigade General||[[Jos\u00e9 Justo Alvarez Valenzuela]]||\n|-\n|12||1868\u20131871||Engineers Colonel||[[Amado Camacho]]||\n|-\n|13||1871\u20131880||Engineers Colonel||[[Miguel Quintana Gonz\u00e1lez]]||\n|-\n|14||1880\u20131883||Divisional General||[[S\u00f3stenes Rocha]]||\n|-\n|15||1883\u20131884||General Graduado, Coronel Tec. de Artiller\u00eda||[[Francisco de Paula M\u00e9ndez]]||\n|-\n|16||1884\u20131906||Engineers Colonel General||[[Juan Villegas (general)|Juan Villegas]]||Highest-ranking officer commandant of the College\n|-\n|17||1906\u20131912||General de Brigada de E.M.

It was founded in 1823 and located in the former Palace of the Inquisition in [[Mexico City]]. Initially designated as the ''Cadet Academy'' it was renamed in 1823 as the ''Colegio Militar''. The College was relocated in Perote, [[Veracruz]], before being returned to Mexico City where it was established in the Betlemitas monastery (today occupied by the Interactive Museum of the Economy and the Museum of the Mexican Army and Air Force).  From 1835 the Military College was located in the Recogidas Building (destroyed by an earthquake in 1985). Cadets training for the Mexican Navy originally formed part of the student body but in 1897 the [[Heroica Escuela Naval Militar|Military Naval School]] was established as a separate institution in [[Veracruz]].\n\nThe Military College comes under the supervision of the [[Mexican Army and Air Force University]] and the Army Military Education General Directorate.\n\n== History of the College ==\n\n===Foundation===\nAlthough plans for a military academy were proposed as early as 1818, it would be only in 1822 when such plans materialized, with the efforts of Diego Garcia Conde, the ex-Spanish military officer then serving in the [[Mexican Army]], for such an academy to be formed were approved by the Mexican Imperial Government, through the Imperial War Ministry.\n\nIn the middle of the year, Emperor [[Agustin de Iturbide]] ordered that the  Former Inquisition Palace Complex become the headquarters of the now newly founded Military College of Mexico, the Military Cadet Academy and the Engineers Training School, all under their first director, Brigadier Diego Garcia Conde. By the next year, through the orders of War Minister General Jose Joaquin de Herrera, the  Military College of Mexico was relaunched as a separate academy with headquarters at [[San Carlos Fortress]], in [[Perote, Veracruz]] state. In 1824, in compliance with an order from [[President of Mexico|President]] [[Guadalupe Victoria]], 18 cadets of the now called ''Perote Military College of Mexico'', through the permission of then college director Col. Juan Dominguez y Galvez,  became the first cadets of the new ''Naval Aspirants College'' and the ''Tlacotalpan Nautical School'' trained to be the [[Mexican Navy]]'s future ship officers.\n\n===Early years===\n[[File:Mexican cadet.jpg|thumb|250px|right|A cadet of the Heroic Military Academy (Mexico) with a [[golden eagle]], the academy mascot.]]\n[[File:Mujereshcm.JPG|thumb|250px|right|Another cadet holding the golden eagle mascot. A female cadet stands in the foreground. Both wear the gala uniform of the Cadet Corps]]\nIn 1828, due to a campaign against [[Secret society|secret societies]] and [[Freemasonry|masonic lodges]], Lt. Col. Manuel Montano's visit became the reason for the College's first loyalty act by the Corps of Cadets and its faculty, for their response to him was that the Military College should be exempted from the campaign due to the fact that no one in the College's cadet rosters were either secret society members nor Masons, and it turned into a national act of loyalty by the college cadets and faculty. As a result of this great deed, the College in March 1828 returned to Mexico City, first in the Bethelemitas convent and later in the Inquisition Palace Complex on July 1. By then, it began to be recognized by every Mexican as the nation's premier military educational institution.\n\nThe turmoil that sparked in the 1828 presidential elections took its toll on the College cadets. On September 11, a rebellion led by Generals [[Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna|Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna]] and Jose Maria Lobato  denounced the election results ten days before, in which Manuel Gomez Pedraza emerged as the winner. Two months later, on November 30, they together with Lorenzo de Zavala and Col. Santiago Garcia staged a coup d'\u00e9tat that took over the La {{Not a typo|Acordada}} building demanding that the election results be voided by Congress. The same day, President Victoria called on the College cadets to proceed to the National Palace, and they fought on the side of the armed forces for 4 days until the fighting ended on December 4, with a compromise reached by both sides. Class would resume later the next day.\n\nPolitical turmoil broke out again in 1840. On July 13 of that year Gen. [[Jose Urrea]] bolted out of jail and led a rebellion against President Anastacio Bustamante, who was later imprisoned in the presidential residence. General Gabriel Valencia then ordered all troops loyal to the President to proceed at once to the city citadel. These included the cadets of the Military College under its then director Brigade General Pedro Conde, who was received by Gen. Valencia and sent a delegation of cadets to the citadel. The College delegation then moved to a church where they fought anti-Bustamante troops, which resulted in two wounded cadets (Juan Rico and Antonio Groso), the former would later die of his wounds sustained. On the 16th President Bustamante left his residence and Gen. Vicente Filisola arrived at the church premises. On that night, when an armistice was made, the attempted coup was already over.\n\nThe next year, it relocated to the Chalpultepec Castle in Mexico City. This castle would be, in 6 years time, during the Mexican War, a place where 5 cadets and an officer in the faculty died in defense of the Mexican nation, and it would gain the ''Heroic'' designation. After a few years, the College relocated to the Inquisition Palace and later to San Lucas.\n\nIn 1846, the College's only naval director, Graduate Ship Captain Francisco Garcia began his duties as College Commandant, a duty lasting until 1847. A sudden rebellion by the Corps of Cadets happened during his tenure.\n\n===The Ni\u00f1os H\u00e9roes===\nThe following year (1847), during the first term of Col. Jos\u00e9 Mariano Monterde Segura as commandant, the [[Mexican\u2013American War]] reached Mexico City and the Military Academy. On September 11 cadets of the Academy were involved in fighting on the Condress Estate.  On September 13 Chapultepec Castle and its surroundings became the site of the historic [[Battle of Chapultepec]]. Its Mexican Army defenders, under the leadership of [[Nicol\u00e1s Bravo]], former President and a veteran of the war of independence, included about 200 members of the Corps of Cadets, aged between 13 and 19. At the end of the battle five cadets -  Juan Escutia (who reportedly leapt to his death wrapped in the [[Flag of Mexico]]), Agustin Melgar, Francisco Marquez, Fernando Montes de Oca, and Vicente Su\u00e1rez; plus faculty member Lieutenant of Juan de la Barrera - all refused to retreat and died in a final stand as the \"young heroes\" of Academy legend. An unknown proportion of the other cadets became casualties or prisoners during the earlier stages of the battle.\n\nEach year on the anniversary of the battle, the sacrifice of the five [[Ni\u00f1os H\u00e9roes]] of the Military Academy is remembered nationwide, with a national ceremony at the monument with the Corps in attendance.\n\n===1857-1920===\nIn 1858, during the term of Commandant Colonel Luis Tola Algar\u00edn, the College moved its facilities to the former Church of Sts. Peter and Paul in Mexico City.  During the [[Reform War]] the same year the Corps of Cadets was involved in a clash with the forces of Gen. Miguel Blanco on October 15 in [[Toluca]]. Casualties suffered by the cadets and instructors in this and subsequent actions caused the closure of the College in 1861.\n\nThe College was reopened in 1867. Located first in the [[National Palace (Mexico)|National Palace]] the College was moved to various locations before returning to the Chapultepec Castle in 1882. Formerly a joint services institution, the College became an academy for the Mexican Army only in 1897, following the establishment of the Military Naval School in Veracruz.\n\nOn 8 February 1913 the 600 cadets of the Military College played a part in the coup known as The [[Ten Tragic Days]] against President [[Francisco Madero]].<ref>Ronald Atkin, page 126 \"Revolution! Mexico 1910-20\", Granada Publishing Ltd. 1973</ref> Cadets of the separate ''Escuela Militar de Aspirantes de Tlalpan'' (established in 1905 as an additional academy for training junior officers) had joined with regular army units in an ultimately successful attempt to overthrow Madero. However a detachment of cadets from the Heroic Military College, acting on the orders of Deputy Commandant Lieutenant Colonel V\u00edctor Hern\u00e1ndez Covarrubias  escorted President Madero from Chapultepec Castle to the National Palace on the following day. Termed the ''Loyalty March'', this action is still marked by an annual parade by the Corps of Cadets, attended by the present-day [[President of Mexico]] and his Cabinet.\n\nThe new government down-graded the role of the Heroic Military College, briefly merging its functions with those of the ''Escuela Militar de Aspirantes de Tlalpan'' and accelerating the training of cadets from both academies to reinforce the crumbling Federal Army. Following the overthrow of General [[Victoriano Huerta]] in July 1914 and the disbandment of the Federal Army, the College was closed. It was reestablished in February 1920 albelt in a new campus in Popotla, Mexico City. Later that spring the then reestablished cavalry squadron were involved in what has been termed \"the final cavalry charge in the Americas\". This occurred on May 8, when on the orders of Colonel Rodolfo Casillas the cadets acted in support of regular army dragoons led by General Pilar Sanchez under attack by rebel forces in Apizaco, Tlaxcala. In another engagement two days later a cadet was killed in action in San Marcos while supporting government forces.\n\n==The College from 1947 to today==\n[[File:Desfile Militar Conmemorativo del CCV Aniversario del Inicio de la Independencia de M\u00e9xico. (21286670090).jpg|thumb|A cadet of the Heroic Military Academy with a [[golden eagle]] during a parade in 2015.]]\nIn 1947 The Military College celebrated the centenary of the Corps of Cadets' participation in the Battle of Chapultepec, the finest hour of its history.  In 1949, the [[Congress of the Union]] formally conferred the \"Heroic\" designation to both the Corps and to the Midshipmen's Battalion of the Naval Military Academy, the latter for its role in resisting the [[United States occupation of Veracruz]] in 1914.\n\nTo celebrate the 150th anniversary of the Heroic Military College (1820-1970), 1 oz silver coins were minted by the Central Bank. In addition stamps featuring two Military College [[shako]]s were printed by the Government of Mexico. A special issue of stamps also commemorated the Golden Jubilee of \"the final cavalry charge in the Americas\"; carried out by the cavalry cadets of the college in 1920 (see above).\n\nIn 1976, the College's present campus in [[Tlalpan]] Borough, [[Mexico City]], was formally opened, partially damaged by the 1985 earthquake that struck the city. Today, the commandant of the academy is Brigade General Julio \u00c1lvarez Arellano.\n\nThe school was used as a setting for [[Luis Miguel]]'s 1989 music video \"[[La Incondicional]]\". In the video he plays an Air Force cadet who is in love, but he must take his stuides as soldier seriously. In a marching scene towards the end of the song one can see the \"Por el Honor de Mexico\" banner.\n\nPerote, the second home of the Military College, has been dubbed by the Veracruz State Congress as ''The Cradle of the Military College'' since 2002.\n\nFrom 2007, the academy has accepted female cadets. The present Corps is regiment-sized and has among its units a cavalry squadron and an artillery battery, plus an armored cavalry training squadron raised recently - a first in a military academy in Latin America.\n\n== Motto and Collegiate Slogan ==\n''Por el Honor de Mexico'' (''For Mexico's Honor'') is the college motto, made in a contest organized by radio station XEQ in commemoration of the centenary of the defense of Chalpultepec Castle in 1947.\n\nEvery midday, after the afternoon ceremony and before the midday parade, the following cheer is done by the Corps of Cadets:\n\n* Cadet Corps Commander: \"Heroico Colegio Militar\" (\"Heroic Military College\")\n* Cadets: ''Por el Honor de Mexico!'' (''For Mexico's Honor!'')\n\n== Collegiate Hymn and March ==\n\n=== Hymn of the Heroic Military College ===\n[[File:Ceremonia_en_Her\u00f3ico_Colegio_Militar.JPG|thumb|350px|right|A military parade part of a ceremony on Heroico Colegio Militar at Tlalpan, Mexico City.]]\n[[File:Colegio_mil.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Military College]]\nThe Hymn of the Heroic Military College was composed in 1930 by Prof. Jos\u00e9 Ignacio R\u00edos del R\u00edo.<ref name=\"sedena.gob.mx\">http://www.sedena.gob.mx/index.php?id=234</ref>\n\n===Lyrics===\n'''Spanish'''<br />\n''Chorus'' <br />\nVibre el clar\u00edn de la guerra, resuenen las fanfarrias<br />\nRedoblen los tambores, una marcha triunfal<br />\nY lleven de la Patria a todos los confines<br />\nTu nombre sacrosanto,<br /> \nColegio Militar<br />\nTu nombre sacrosanto,<br /> \nColegio Militar\n\n''Verse<br />\nColegio sacrosanto, de memoria bendita<br />\nde forjaran sus almas, Montes de Oca y Melgar<br />\nLa Patria bate marcha de honor a tu pasado,<br />\nde epopeyas gloriosas y de nombre inmortal.\n\nY en un gesto sublime de amor y de cari\u00f1o,<br />\nbendice a los efebos que supieron morir <br />\nba\u00f1ados por las r\u00e1fagas de luz espendorosa<br />\nque el \u00e1ngel de la gloria enviara del cenit.\n\n''Repeat Chorus''\n\n=== Regimental March of the Heroic Military College ===\nThe Regimental March was composed by Lieutenant Jos\u00e9 Sotero Ortiz S\u00e1nchez, in time for the College's 1947 centenary of the Battle of Chapultepec.\n\n===Lyrics===\n[[File:Escolta_hcm.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Listen hcm]]\n'''Spanish'''<br />\nP\u00e1ginas del libro de la historia del Heroico Colegio Militar<br />\nde epopeyas que ya jam\u00e1s se borran del santuario de la inmortalidad.<br />\nCanto que se eleva a la memoria como ofrenda de honor a la lealtad <br />\nde los h\u00e9roes que envueltos por la gloria grandioso ejemplo que nos dio la libertad. <br />\n''Repeat All''\n\nJuventud de mi patria sublime, que march\u00e1is con gallarda ilusi\u00f3n<br /> \naument\u00e1reis la historia que escribe nobles hechos de sangre y honor.<br /> \nYunque forjador de hombres de guerra como Su\u00e1rez, Escutia y Melgar,<br />\nMontes de Oca, M\u00e1rquez y De la Barrera, los ni\u00f1os h\u00e9roes de mi M\u00e9xico inmortal!<br />\n''Repeat All''\n\n== Commandants ==\n<ref>[http://www.sedena.gob.mx/index.php/educacion-militar/planteles-militares/heroico-colegio-militar/historia-hcm/directores-hcm Directores del Heroico Colegio Militar], [[Secretariat of National Defense (Mexico)]] (SEDENA)</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!No.!!Period!!Rank!!!!Notes\n|-\n|1||1818\u20131823||Brigadier General||[[Diego Garc\u00eda Conde]]||\n|-\n|2||1823\u20131824||Cavalry Colonel||[[Juan Dom\u00ednguez y G\u00e1lvez]]||\n|-\n|3||1825\u20131828||Cavalry Lieutenant Colonel||[[Jos\u00e9 Manuel Arechaga]]||\n|-\n|4||1835\u20131836||Engineers Colonel||[[Ignacio Mora y Villamil]]||\n|-\n|5||1836\u20131846||Brigadier General||[[Pedro Garc\u00eda Conde]]\n|-\n|6||1846\u20131847||Graduate Captain, Commander||[[Francisco Garc\u00eda Salinas]]||Only naval officer commandant of the College\n|-\n|7||1847\u20131853||Graduate Gen., Engineers Colonel||[[Jos\u00e9 Mariano Monterde Segura]]||Led the defense of [[Chapultepec Castle]] during the [[Battle of Chapultepec]] which took a heavy toll for the Academy\n|-\n|8||1853\u20131854||Graduate Gen., Engineers Colonel||[[Santiago Blanco Duque de Estrada]]||\n|-\n|9||1854\u20131859||Graduate Gen., Engineers Colonel||[[Luis Tola Algar\u00edn]]||\n|-\n|10||1859\u20131860||Engineers Colonel (Staff)||Jos\u00e9 Mariano Monterde Segura||2nd Period\n|-\n|11||1861\u20131863||Brigade General||[[Jos\u00e9 Justo Alvarez Valenzuela]]||\n|-\n|12||1868\u20131871||Engineers Colonel||[[Amado Camacho]]||\n|-\n|13||1871\u20131880||Engineers Colonel||[[Miguel Quintana Gonz\u00e1lez]]||\n|-\n|14||1880\u20131883||Divisional General||[[S\u00f3stenes Rocha]]||\n|-\n|15||1883\u20131884||General Graduado, Coronel Tec. de Artiller\u00eda||[[Francisco de Paula M\u00e9ndez]]||\n|-\n|16||1884\u20131906||Engineers Colonel General||[[Juan Villegas (general)|Juan Villegas]]||Highest-ranking officer commandant of the College\n|-\n|17||1906\u20131912||General de Brigada de E.M.

After engaging and defeating the villains, Daniel comes within a hair's breadth of retrieving the shrine, only to have it escape from his grasp by random chance (for example, drifting away after being tied to a bunch of balloons, or being swept into the ocean), thus ensuring that the search continues into the next episode.\n\n==Syndication==\nThe show was available for purchase on [[iTunes]], and could be streamed for free in the US on [[Netflix]], [[Internet Movie Database]], [[Hulu]], and [[The Minisode Network]] and [[Crackle (company)|Crackle]].

It starred [[Joey Dedio]], [[Robert Ito]], and [[Janice Kawaye]]. It is based on the ''[[The Karate Kid (franchise)|Karate Kid]]'' series of films, and was produced by [[DIC Entertainment|DIC Animation City]], [[Saban Entertainment]] and [[Columbia Pictures Television]].<ref name=Perlmutter>{{cite book |last1=Perlmutter |first1=David |title=The Encyclopedia of American Animated Television Shows |date=2018 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |isbn=978-1538103739 |page=333}}</ref>\n\nThe show was originally planned for daily syndication for fall 1988 with 65 episodes, before eventually settling on a 13-episode order for NBC Saturday mornings in 1989.<ref name=\"Broadcasting Magazine; August 10, 1987 issue; Pages 2 and 3\">{{cite web|url=http://s23.postimg.org/uphxymdbe/download.jpg|publisher=americanradiohistory.com|accessdate=2015-10-29}}</ref>\n\n==Overview==\n\nThe show retains apprentice Daniel LaRusso (voiced by [[Joey Dedio]]) and his mentor [[Mr. Miyagi]] (voiced by [[Robert Ito]]) but abandons the karate tournament motif for an adventure/quest setting. A miniature [[shrine]] with magic powers is taken from its resting place on [[Okinawa]], and it is up to Miyagi and Daniel to recover it. Together with Okinawan girl Taki Tamurai (voiced by [[Janice Kawaye]]), the karatekas search the globe and, naturally, encounter several opportunities to fight their way out of trouble.<ref name=Daytime>{{cite book |last1=Hyatt |first1=Wesley |title=The Encyclopedia of Daytime Television |date=1997 |publisher=Watson-Guptill Publications |isbn=978-0823083152 |url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofda00hyat/page/246/mode/2up|accessdate=19 March 2020|page=246}}</ref>\n===Episode formula===\nThe episodes typically follow a similar formula: Mr. Miyagi obtains a lead on the shrine's location in some exotic corner of the world. Daniel and Taki follow up on it, and in the process encounter some villains who have either obtained or are seeking to obtain the shrine for their own evil purposes. After engaging and defeating the villains, Daniel comes within a hair's breadth of retrieving the shrine, only to have it escape from his grasp by random chance (for example, drifting away after being tied to a bunch of balloons, or being swept into the ocean), thus ensuring that the search continues into the next episode.\n\n==Syndication==\nThe show was available for purchase on [[iTunes]], and could be streamed for free in the US on [[Netflix]], [[Internet Movie Database]], [[Hulu]], and [[The Minisode Network]] and [[Crackle (company)|Crackle]]. As of May 2018, the show was no longer available on iTunes, Netflix, or Hulu.\n\nIn Canada, the series can be streamed online via CTV's free, ad-supported video on demand hub \"CTV Throwback\".\n\n==Episodes==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:80%;\" style=background:#FFFFFF;\"\\\n|-\n! style=background:#252cb3|<span style=\"color: white;\">No.</span>\n! style=background:#252cb3|<span style=\"color: white;\">Title</span>\n! style=background:#252cb3|<span style=\"color: white;\">Original air date</span>\n{{Episode list\n| Title=My Brother's Keeper\n| OriginalAirDate={{Start date|1989|9|9}}\n| EpisodeNumber=01\n| ShortSummary=In South America, a diffident teenager from a Shuar tribe finds the shrine and believes it can give him the confidence and strength to pass his tests of manhood.
