As they enter an alley, Jimmy tells his companion that his name is Saul Goodman. In the alley, they discover a wallet with cash next to a barely conscious drunk man. The companion takes the cash, and Jimmy takes the man's [[Rolex]] watch. Jimmy estimates it to be worth more than the wallet, leading his companion to trade the found money plus some additional cash of his own in exchange for the watch. After the companion runs away with the watch, a cheap counterfeit, Jimmy and the \"unconscious\" man return to Jimmy's residence to congratulate each other and split the proceeds of their scam.\n\n===Main story===\nJimmy gives the Kettlemans the option of hiring him as their lawyer, but they refuse. The Kettlemans instead offer Jimmy a [[bribe]] if he does not reveal that they stole the $1.6 million, and he accepts. Nacho is released from police custody and accuses Jimmy of warning the Kettlemans, for which Nacho says Jimmy will face \"consequences\". Jimmy says he warned the family only for the sake of the children, and that Nacho should be grateful that the warning prevented Nacho from committing kidnapping or murder, for which he probably would have been charged, since he was noticed while conducting surveillance on the Kettleman home.\n\nIn his office at the nail salon, Jimmy cooks his books to make it look like the bribe he took from the Kettlemans is legitimate payment for his services. He spends the money on a personal makeover and a billboard advertisement which shares obvious similarities with Hamlin Hamlin & McGill. Kim confronts Jimmy over the imitation, and Howard Hamlin sues him for [[trademark infringement]]. The court rules in HHM's favor, and Jimmy is ordered to remove the billboard within 48 hours.\n\nAfter failing to persuade any news outlets to cover his predicament as a [[human interest story]], Jimmy hires a freelance media team to record his video plea for sympathy. During filming, the worker removing the billboard slips and falls, and is held up only by his safety harness. Jimmy climbs up and pulls the worker to safety while passersby watch and record, as does his media team. It is revealed that the accident was staged by Jimmy as a publicity stunt, which Howard and Kim see through when they watch it on the television news.

The episode aired on February 23, 2015, on [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] in the United States. Outside of the United States, the episode premiered on streaming service [[Netflix]] in several countries. \n\n==Plot==\n===Opening===\nIn a [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]], Jimmy and an unidentified companion leave a bar. As they enter an alley, Jimmy tells his companion that his name is Saul Goodman. In the alley, they discover a wallet with cash next to a barely conscious drunk man. The companion takes the cash, and Jimmy takes the man's [[Rolex]] watch. Jimmy estimates it to be worth more than the wallet, leading his companion to trade the found money plus some additional cash of his own in exchange for the watch. After the companion runs away with the watch, a cheap counterfeit, Jimmy and the \"unconscious\" man return to Jimmy's residence to congratulate each other and split the proceeds of their scam.\n\n===Main story===\nJimmy gives the Kettlemans the option of hiring him as their lawyer, but they refuse. The Kettlemans instead offer Jimmy a [[bribe]] if he does not reveal that they stole the $1.6 million, and he accepts. Nacho is released from police custody and accuses Jimmy of warning the Kettlemans, for which Nacho says Jimmy will face \"consequences\". Jimmy says he warned the family only for the sake of the children, and that Nacho should be grateful that the warning prevented Nacho from committing kidnapping or murder, for which he probably would have been charged, since he was noticed while conducting surveillance on the Kettleman home.\n\nIn his office at the nail salon, Jimmy cooks his books to make it look like the bribe he took from the Kettlemans is legitimate payment for his services. He spends the money on a personal makeover and a billboard advertisement which shares obvious similarities with Hamlin Hamlin & McGill. Kim confronts Jimmy over the imitation, and Howard Hamlin sues him for [[trademark infringement]]. The court rules in HHM's favor, and Jimmy is ordered to remove the billboard within 48 hours.\n\nAfter failing to persuade any news outlets to cover his predicament as a [[human interest story]], Jimmy hires a freelance media team to record his video plea for sympathy. During filming, the worker removing the billboard slips and falls, and is held up only by his safety harness. Jimmy climbs up and pulls the worker to safety while passersby watch and record, as does his media team. It is revealed that the accident was staged by Jimmy as a publicity stunt, which Howard and Kim see through when they watch it on the television news. The stunt works, and Jimmy acquires numerous new clients.\n\nJimmy visits Chuck and brings him his newspapers, but hides the local one that includes a report on the \"rescue\". Chuck congratulates Jimmy on his newfound success, but becomes suspicious when he notices his local paper is missing. Jimmy dismisses it as meaningless, but after he leaves, a suspicious Chuck braves exposure to electricity to run to his neighbor's driveway and steal their newspaper (leaving a $5 bill as payment), which leads to his discovery of Jimmy's scam.\n\n==Production==\nThe episode was written by supervising producer [[Gennifer Hutchison]], who was also a writer and producer on ''[[Breaking Bad]]''.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://variety.com/2013/tv/news/breaking-bad-writers-join-better-call-saul-staff-1200981189/ |title=\u2018Breaking Bad\u2019 Writers Join \u2018Better Call Saul\u2019 Staff |last=Littleton |first=Cynthia |work=Variety |date=December 20, 2013 |accessdate=January 12, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/better-call-saul-hamlindigo-blue-776354 |title='Better Call Saul' Writer on Jimmy's \"Terrifying\" Plan, Saul Goodman \"Reveal\" |first=Aaron |last=Couch |work=The Hollywood Reporter |date=February 23, 2015 |accessdate=February 24, 2015}}</ref> It was directed by [[Colin Bucksey]], who directed four episodes of ''Breaking Bad''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ew.com/article/2014/07/11/better-call-saul-photos |title='Better Call Saul': New photos, details from 'Breaking Bad' spin-off |first=James |last=Hibberd |work=Entertainment Weekly |date=July 11, 2014 |accessdate=February 24, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nUpon airing, the episode received 2.87 million American viewers, and an 18-49 rating of 1.4.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2015/02/24/monday-cable-ratings-monday-night-raw-tops-night-love-hip-hop-better-call-saul-black-ink-crew-more/366753/|title=Monday Cable Ratings: 'Monday Night RAW' Tops Night + 'Love & Hip Hop', 'Better Call Saul', 'Black Ink Crew' & More|work=TV by the Numbers|last=Kondolojy|first=Amanda|date=February 24, 2015 |accessdate=February 24, 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe episode received positive reception from critics.

It is located along [[Manitoba Highway 16|PTH 16]] and [[Manitoba Highway 83|PTH 83]], and is at the western terminus of [[Manitoba Highway 45|PTH 45]]. Russell is approximately {{convert|15|km|0|abbr=on}} from the [[Saskatchewan]] border and {{convert|340|km|0|abbr=on}} northwest of [[Winnipeg]]. The community is home to 1,611 people (2011 census).\n\nRussell is the home of Manitoba's Beef and Barley Festival, which is held annually in October to celebrate the region's strong agricultural tradition. Grain farming and cattle ranching are extensive in the surrounding areas.\n\n== History ==\nEuropean-Canadians first settled the area around Russell around 1880.  The first post office began operations at a site north of the present community in 1880, and was called \"Shell River\".  The closest CPR ([[Canadian Pacific Railway]]) point was renamed to Russell in 1889.  Also in 1889, a Dr [[Barnardo's]] Home for boys was established.  The home and local farmers sponsored transportation for British orphans to come to the area to work on farms.  Russell was officially incorporated as a town in 1913.\n\n== Industrial development ==\nRecent{{When|date=February 2017}} changes to agriculture, such as the elimination of the Western Grain Transportation Subsidy, have put the region in a unique position. With one of the highest freight rates in western Canada, the Russell area is well-positioned to experience an explosion in value-added processing.  Bunge Canada, an advanced [[canola]]-processing plant, is located at Harrowby, {{convert|15|km|0|abbr=on}} west of Russell.\n\nNearby potash mining in [[Saskatchewan]] provides jobs for numerous Russell residents, as well as purchasing supplies and services locally. The first potash mine in Manitoba has been proposed for a site just southwest of Russell, but due to the greater depth of the potash and higher taxes versus Saskatchewan, progress has been stalled for the last 20 years.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}{{When|date=February 2017}}\n\nRussell and the surrounding rural municipalities are promoting tourism through the Asessippi Parkland Economic Development Corp.\n\n== Education ==\nA semi-major service centre for the regional agricultural communities, Russell provides educational facilities ranging from day care and nursery, to post-secondary facilities. Russell is part of the [[Park West School Division]]. The Assiniboine Community College also has a regional campus located in Russell. The community has access to First Year Distant Education transmission, allowing individuals to take first-year education via internet.\n\n== Recreation ==\nRecreational facilities include a serviced campground, tennis courts, ball fields, curling and hockey arenas, community halls, a swimming pool, snowboarding and downhill skiing, and a nine-hole golf course.\n\nRussell is located only {{convert|27|km|0|abbr=on}} from [[Asessippi Provincial Park]], the site of Asessippi Ski Area & Resort\u2014a world-class ski facility and year-round family park.

It is located along [[Manitoba Highway 16|PTH 16]] and [[Manitoba Highway 83|PTH 83]], and is at the western terminus of [[Manitoba Highway 45|PTH 45]]. Russell is approximately {{convert|15|km|0|abbr=on}} from the [[Saskatchewan]] border and {{convert|340|km|0|abbr=on}} northwest of [[Winnipeg]]. The community is home to 1,611 people (2011 census).\n\nRussell is the home of Manitoba's Beef and Barley Festival, which is held annually in October to celebrate the region's strong agricultural tradition. Grain farming and cattle ranching are extensive in the surrounding areas.\n\n== History ==\nEuropean-Canadians first settled the area around Russell around 1880.  The first post office began operations at a site north of the present community in 1880, and was called \"Shell River\".  The closest CPR ([[Canadian Pacific Railway]]) point was renamed to Russell in 1889.  Also in 1889, a Dr [[Barnardo's]] Home for boys was established.  The home and local farmers sponsored transportation for British orphans to come to the area to work on farms.  Russell was officially incorporated as a town in 1913.\n\n== Industrial development ==\nRecent{{When|date=February 2017}} changes to agriculture, such as the elimination of the Western Grain Transportation Subsidy, have put the region in a unique position. With one of the highest freight rates in western Canada, the Russell area is well-positioned to experience an explosion in value-added processing.  Bunge Canada, an advanced [[canola]]-processing plant, is located at Harrowby, {{convert|15|km|0|abbr=on}} west of Russell.\n\nNearby potash mining in [[Saskatchewan]] provides jobs for numerous Russell residents, as well as purchasing supplies and services locally. The first potash mine in Manitoba has been proposed for a site just southwest of Russell, but due to the greater depth of the potash and higher taxes versus Saskatchewan, progress has been stalled for the last 20 years.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}{{When|date=February 2017}}\n\nRussell and the surrounding rural municipalities are promoting tourism through the Asessippi Parkland Economic Development Corp.\n\n== Education ==\nA semi-major service centre for the regional agricultural communities, Russell provides educational facilities ranging from day care and nursery, to post-secondary facilities. Russell is part of the [[Park West School Division]]. The Assiniboine Community College also has a regional campus located in Russell. The community has access to First Year Distant Education transmission, allowing individuals to take first-year education via internet.\n\n== Recreation ==\nRecreational facilities include a serviced campground, tennis courts, ball fields, curling and hockey arenas, community halls, a swimming pool, snowboarding and downhill skiing, and a nine-hole golf course.\n\nRussell is located only {{convert|27|km|0|abbr=on}} from [[Asessippi Provincial Park]], the site of Asessippi Ski Area & Resort\u2014a world-class ski facility and year-round family park.  The park also contains  the [[Lake of the Prairies]], a 64&nbsp;km-long lake that is one of the best Walleye-fishing lakes in North America {{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}. In Manitoba the lake recorded an annual walleye catch per square kilometre that is five times greater than the provincial average.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.parklandtourism.com/index.php?communityid=ASESSIMB&pageid=COMDET|title=Asessippi Provincial Park |author=|date=|accessdate=2010-02-13|publisher=Parkland Tourism Association}}</ref>\n\n== Climate ==\n{{Weather box\n|location = Russell\n|metric first = yes\n|single line= yes\n|collapsed =\n|Jan record high C = 6.1\n|Feb record high C = 10.5\n|Mar record high C = 18.9\n|Apr record high C = 33\n|May record high C = 36.5\n|Jun record high C = 41.1\n|Jul record high C = 40\n|Aug record high C = 37.2\n|Sep record high C = 34.4\n|Oct record high C = 31.1\n|Nov record high C = 21.1\n|Dec record high C = 12.2\n|year record high C = 41.1\n|Jan high C = \u221213.5\n|Feb high C = \u221210.1\n|Mar high C = -2.7\n|Apr high C = 8.6\n|May high C = 17.4\n|Jun high C = 21.6\n|Jul high C = 24.5\n|Aug high C = 23.2\n|Sep high C = 16.2\n|Oct high C = 9.1\n|Nov high C = \u22122.7\n|Dec high C = \u221211.5\n|year high C = 6.7\n|Jan mean C = \u221218\n|Feb mean C = \u221214.7\n|Mar mean C = -7.4\n|Apr mean C = 3\n|May mean C = 11\n|Jun mean C = 15.5\n|Jul mean C = 18.1\n|Aug mean C = 16.8\n|Sep mean C = 10.5\n|Oct mean C = 4\n|Nov mean C = \u22126.5\n|Dec mean C = \u221215.7\n|year mean C = 1.4\n|Jan low C = \u221222.6\n|Feb low C = \u221219.4\n|Mar low C = \u221212.1\n|Apr low C = \u22122.7\n|May low C = 4.6\n|Jun low C = 9.3\n|Jul low C = 11.7\n|Aug low C = 10.3\n|Sep low C = 4.8\n|Oct low C = \u22121.2\n|Nov low C = \u221210.2\n|Dec low C = \u221219.8\n|year low C = \u22123.9\n|Jan record low C = \u221248.9\n|Feb record low C = \u221247.8\n|Mar record low C = \u221242.8\n|Apr record low C = \u221231.1\n|May record low C = \u221212.2\n|Jun record low C = -3.9\n|Jul record low C = -1.1\n|Aug record low C = \u22128.9\n|Sep record low C = \u221214.4\n|Oct record low C = \u221227.8\n|Nov record low C = \u221237.2\n|Dec record low C = \u221243.3\n|year record low C = \u221248.9\n|Jan precipitation mm = 23.7\n|Feb precipitation mm = 20.7\n|Mar precipitation mm = 32.4\n|Apr precipitation mm = 25.5\n|May precipitation mm = 47.4\n|Jun precipitation mm = 82.7\n|Jul precipitation mm = 70.7\n|Aug precipitation mm = 67\n|Sep precipitation mm = 61.4\n|Oct precipitation mm = 29.2\n|Nov precipitation mm = 20.5\n|Dec precipitation mm = 25.3\n|year precipitation mm = 506.5\n|source 1=[[Environment Canada]]<ref name= \"envcan\" >{{Cite web |url=http://www.climate.weatheroffice.gc.ca/climate_normals/results_e.html?stnID=3533&lang=e&dCode=0&province=MAN&provBut=Search&month1=0&month2=12|title= Canadian Climate Normals 1971\u20132000 |publisher= Environment Canada |accessdate=24 August 2012 }}</ref>}}\n\n== Notable people ==\n*[[Red Dutton]] - [[NHL]] hall of famer\n*[[Theoren Fleury]] - [[Ice hockey|Hockey]] player for [[Calgary Flames]], [[New York Rangers]], [[Chicago Blackhawks]], and [[Colorado Avalanche]]\n*[[Jon Montgomery]] - Athlete, [[2010 Winter Olympics|2010 Olympic Games]] Gold Medalist in [[Skeleton (sport)|Skeleton]] and host of ''[[The Amazing Race Canada]]''\n*[[Charles Arkoll Boulton]] - Lieutenant Colonel during [[North-West Rebellion]]\n*[[Kerri Buchberger]] - National volleyball player\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n*[http://www.russellmb.com Official Website]\n*[http://www.communityprofiles.mb.ca/cgi-bin/csd/index.cgi?id=4616032 Community profile]\n*[http://geodepot.statcan.ca/GeoSearch2006/GeoSearch2006.jsp?resolution=H&lang=E&otherLang=F&census=Yes&DisplayData=Yes&NewImage=yes&layer=csd&IdentName=Russell%20(T)&IdentUID=4616032 Map of Russell at Statcan]\n*[http://fc.pwsd.ca/MPSweb/ Major Pratt School]\n*[http://www.mhs.mb.ca/docs/people/pratt_am.shtml Biography of A.M.
