If there is no means of escape, this will usually result in the death of one or both of the fish. Female bettas can also become territorial towards each other if they are housed in too small an aquarium.

([[Velvet (fish disease)|velvet disease]]), a common killer of betta fry in captivity.]]\n\nMale bettas will flare their gills, spread their fins and twist their bodies in a dance if interested in a female. If the female is also interested she will darken in color and develop vertical lines known as breeding bars as a response. Males build [[bubble nest]]s of various sizes and thicknesses at the surface of the water. Most tend to do this regularly even if there is no female present.\n\nPlants or rocks that break the surface often form a base for bubble nests. The act of spawning itself is called a \"nuptial embrace\", for the male wraps his body around the female; around 10\u201340 eggs are released during each embrace, until the female is exhausted of eggs. The male, in his turn, releases [[milt]] into the water, and fertilization takes place externally. During and after spawning, the male uses his mouth to retrieve sinking eggs and deposit them in the bubble nest (during mating the female sometimes assists her partner, but more often she simply devours all the eggs she manages to catch). Once the female has released all of her eggs, she is chased away from the male's territory, as she will likely eat the eggs.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.leaffin.com/betta-fish-breeding/|title=Betta Fish Spawn: Guide from Preparing Breeding Tank to Feeding the Fry|date=8 November 2017|website=Leaffin.com|accessdate=1 April 2019}}</ref>\nIf she is not removed from the tank then she will most likely be killed by the male.\n\nThe eggs will remain in the male's care. He carefully keeps them in his bubble nest, making sure none fall to the bottom, repairing the bubble nest as needed.  Incubation lasts for 24\u201336 hours; newly hatched larvae remain in the nest for the next two to three days until their yolk sacs are fully absorbed. Afterwards, the fry leave the nest and the free-swimming stage begins. In this first period of their lives, ''B. splendens'' fry are totally dependent on their gills; the [[labyrinth organ]] which allows the species to breathe atmospheric oxygen typically develops at three to six weeks of age, depending on the general growth rate, which can be highly variable. ''B. splendens'' can reach sexual maturity at an age as early as 4\u20135 months.\n{{clear}}\n\n==History==\n===Fighting fish===\nSome people of [[Thailand]] and [[Malaysia]] are known to have collected these fish prior to the 19th century from the wild which are line-bred for aggression in eastern Thailand.\n\nIn the wild, betta spar for only a few minutes before one fish backs off. Bred specifically for heightened aggression, domesticated betta matches can go on for much longer, with winners determined by a willingness to continue fighting. Once a fish retreats, the match is over. <!-- uncited, imprecise, needed?Large amounts of money are wagered during these fights, with potential losses as great as a person's home.-->\n\nSeeing the popularity of these fights, the king of [[Thailand]], [[Rama III]], started licensing and collecting these fighting fish. In 1840, he gave some of his prized fish to a man who, in turn, gave them to [[Theodore Edward Cantor]], a medical scientist. Nine years later, Cantor wrote an article describing them under the name ''Macropodus pugnax''.  In 1909, the [[Ichthyology|ichthyologist]] [[Charles Tate Regan]], upon realizing a species was already named ''[[Macropodus pugnax]]'', renamed the domesticated Siamese fighting fish ''Betta splendens''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Betta Origins|url=http://www.bettafishcenter.com/Betta-Origins.shtml|publisher=Betta Fish Center|accessdate=11 June 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe vernacular name \"plakat\", often applied to the short-finned ornamental strains, is derived from the Thai word ''pla kad'' (Thai: \u0e1b\u0e25\u0e32\u0e01\u0e31\u0e14), which literally means \"biting fish\" and is the [[Thai language|Thai]] name for all members of the ''B. splendens'' species complex (as all members have aggressive tendencies in the wild and all are extensively line-bred for aggression in eastern [[Thailand]]) rather than for any specific strain(s) of the Siamese fighting fish. So the term \"fighting fish\" comes in use to generalize all the members of the ''B. splendens'' species complex including the Siamese fighting fish.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.seriouslyfish.com/species/betta-splendens/|title=Betta splendens \u2013 Siamese Fighting Fish (Micracanthus marchei)|publisher=|accessdate=1 April 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.americanaquariumproducts.com/Bettas.html|title=Betta Fish Information; Plakats, Veiltails, Halfmoon, Crowntail|website=Americanaquariumproducts.com|accessdate=1 April 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Aquarium fish===\nIn 1892, this species was imported to France by the French aquarium fish importer [[Pierre Carbonnier]] in [[Paris]], and in 1896, the German aquarium fish importer [[Paul Matte]] in [[Berlin]] imported the first specimens to Germany from Moscow.\n\n===Invasive species===\nIn January 2014 a large population of the fish was discovered in the [[Adelaide River]] Floodplain in the Northern Territory, Australia.<ref name=fishes>{{cite web|last1=Bray|first1=Dianne|title=Siamese Fighting Fish, Betta splendens|url=http://www.fishesofaustralia.net.au/home/species/4919#summary|website=Fishes of Australia|accessdate=29 September 2014}}</ref>  As an invasive species they pose a threat to native fish, frogs and other wetland wildlife.<ref name=fishes />\n\n==In the aquarium==\n=== Water ===\n''Betta'' species prefer a water temperature of around {{convert|75|\u2013|82|F|C}} but have been seen to survive temporarily at the extremes of {{convert|56|F|C}} or {{convert|95|F|C}}.

The Betta must of course have enough room to turn around, but there is no evidence that they require a lot of space. Due to their labyrinth organ they are not dependent on high oxygen levels in the water, so a large surface area for gas exchange is not required.\nSome Betta enthusiasts claim that there is a minimum tank size for a Betta, but to try to set a strict baseline minimum is somewhat arbitrary.[http://www.reef2rainforest.com/2014/03/26/amazonas-videos-bettas-in-the-wild-what-they-tell-us-about-minimum-tank-sizes-for-bettas/].  Reliably performing regular partial water changes (every other day for small unfiltered tanks) would at least ensure the water quality in a smaller tank is acceptable.  Most consider 9 to 19 litres (2.5 - 5 US gallons) to be an ideal tank size for a Betta, \"but you can successfully keep a Betta in a 4 litre (1 gallon) tank provided you clean it regularly\" and maintain an acceptable temperature (generally 24\u00b0C to 26\u00b0C  - 75F to 78F - is considered optimal).<ref>{{Cite book|title=Betta Pals Betta Guide|last=Gordon|first=H|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\nBettas can cohabit with fish that are bottom feeders, however it is not advised to keep them with feeders that may eat their fins or destroy the slime coat (one example is the Siamese Algae Eater, if kept in an inappropriately sized tank)\n\n===Varieties===\n''B. splendens'' can be hybridized with [[Betta imbellis|''B. imbellis'']], ''[[Betta mahachaiensis|B. mahachaiensis]]'', and [[Betta smaragdina|''B. smaragdina'']], though with the latter, the fry tend to have low survival rates.

Often, the males of the species are sold preferentially in stores because of their beauty, compared to the females. Females almost never develop fins as showy as males of the same type and are often more subdued in coloration, though some breeders manage to get females with fairly long fins and bright colors.\n\n===Colors===\n[[File:Betta splendens pale.jpg|thumb|A dalmatian orange male]]\n<!--''B. splendens'' have been affectionately nicknamed \"the Jewel of the Orient\" due to their beauty and wide range of colours which are produced through [[selective breeding]].\n-->\nWild fish exhibit strong colours only when agitated. Breeders have been able to make this coloration permanent, and a wide variety of hues [[true breeding organism|breed true]]. Colours available to the aquarist include red, orange, yellow, blue, steel blue, turquoise/green, black, pastel, white (\"opaque\" white, not to be confused with albino) and multi-coloured fish.\n\nBettas are found in many different colours due to different layers of pigmentation in their skin. The layers (from furthest within to the outer layer) consists of red, yellow, black, iridescent (blue and green), and metallic (not a colour of its own, but reacts with the other colours to change how they are perceived). Any combination of these layers can be present, leading to a wide variety of colours.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Griffin |first=Gerald |date=January 2016 |title=Betta Primer |journal=Amazonas }}</ref>\n \nThe shades of blue, turquoise, and green are slightly [[iridescence|iridescent]], and can appear to change colour with different lighting conditions or viewing angles; this is because these colours (unlike black or red) are not due to [[biological pigment|pigments]], but created through refraction within a layer of translucent [[guanine]] crystals.

Other reasons for flaring can include when they are intimidated by movement or change of scene in their environments. Both sexes display pale horizontal bars if stressed or frightened. However, such colour changes, common in females of any age, are rare in mature males due to their intensity of colour. Females often flare at other females, especially when setting up a [[pecking order]]. [[Flirting]] fish behave similarly, with vertical instead of horizontal stripes indicating a willingness and readiness to breed (females only). ''Betta splendens'' enjoy a decorated tank, being a territorial fish it is necessary to establish territory even when housed alone. They may set up a territory centered on a plant or rocky alcove, sometimes becoming highly possessive of it and aggressive toward trespassing rivals. This is the reason why when kept with other fish the minimum tank size should be 45 litres (about 10 gallons). Contrary to popular belief, bettas are compatible with many other species of aquarium fish.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aquariphiles.com/betta-tank-mates/ |title=7 Excellent Betta Tank Mates for Your Siamese Fighting Fish |date= |accessdate=2015-08-20}}</ref> Given the proper parameters bettas will be known to only be aggressive towards smaller and slower fish than themselves such as [[Guppy|guppies]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.earthsfriends.com/betta-fish-facts/ |title=Betta Fish Facts |website=Earthsfriends.com|date= |accessdate=2015-08-20}}</ref>\n\nThe aggression of this fish has been studied by [[ethology|ethologists]] and [[comparative psychology|comparative psychologists]].<ref>{{cite journal | author=Bronstein, Paul M. | journal = American Journal of Psychology | title = Agonistic Sequences and the Assessment of Opponents in Male ''Betta splendens''|jstor=1422809 | year = 1998 | volume = 265 | pages=163\u2013177 | issue=2}}</ref> These fish have historically been the objects of gambling; two male fish are pitted against each other to fight and bets are placed on which one will win. One fish will arise the victor, the fight continuing until one participant is submissive. These competitions can result in the death of either one or both fish depending on the seriousness of their injuries. To avoid fights over territory, male Siamese fighting fish are best isolated from one another. Males will occasionally even respond aggressively to their own reflections in a mirror. Though this is obviously safer than exposing the fish to another male, prolonged sight of their reflection may lead to stress in some individuals. Not all Siamese fighting fish respond negatively to other males, especially when the tank is large enough for each fish to create their own designated territory.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fishkeepingadvice.com/betta-fish-care/ |title=Complete Betta Fish Care Guide (Tank, Diet & Aggression) |date= |accessdate=2016-03-03}}</ref>\n[[File:Female bettas in community tank.jpg|thumb|Several females in a [[Community aquarium|community tank]] with [[Poecilia|mollies]] and [[rainbowfish]]]]\n\n===Aggressive behavior in females===\nIn general, studies have shown that females exhibit similar aggressive behaviors as their male counterparts, but these behaviors are less common.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Elcoro|first1=Mirari|last2=Da Silva|first2=Stephanie|last3=Lattal|first3=Kennon|title=Visual Reinforcement in the Female Siamese Fighting Fish, Betta Splendens|journal= Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior|date=2008|volume=90|issue=1|pages=53\u201360|doi=10.1901/jeab.2008.90-53|pmid=18683612|pmc=2441580}}</ref> A group of female Siamese fighting fish were observed over a period of two weeks. During these two weeks, the following behaviors were recorded: attacking, displays, and biting food. The results of this observational study indicated that when females are housed in small groups, they form a stable dominance order. For example, the fish who was ranked at the top showed higher levels of mutual displays, in comparison to the fish who were of lower ranks. The researchers also found that the duration of the displays differed depending on whether an attack occurred.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Elwood|first1=R.W.|last2=Rainey|first2=C.J.|title=Social Organization and Aggression Within Small Groups of Female Siamese Fighting Fish, Betta Splendens|journal=Aggressive Behavior|date=1983|volume=9|issue=4|pages=303\u2013308|doi=10.1002/1098-2337(1983)9:4<303::aid-ab2480090404>3.0.co;2-5}}</ref> The results of these studies indicate that female Siamese fighting fish should be considered as often as males, as there are evidently interesting variations in their behaviors as well.\n\n===Courtship behavior===\nThere has been numerous research in the area of courtship behavior between male and female Siamese fighting fish. This research has focused on the aggressive behaviors of males during the courtship process. For example, one study found that when male fish are in the bubble nest phase, their aggression toward females is quite low. This is due to the males attempting to attract potential mates to their nest, so eggs can successfully be laid.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite journal|last1=Forsatkar|first1=Mohammad|last2=Nematollahi|first2=Mohammad|last3=Bron|first3=Culum|title=Male Siamese Fighting Fish Use Gill Flaring As The First Display Towards Territorial Intruders|journal=Journal of Ethology|date=August 2016|doi=10.1007/s10164-016-0489-1|volume=35|pages=51\u201359}}</ref> It has also been found that in regards to mate choice, females often \u201ceavesdrop\u201d on pairs of male Siamese fighting fish while they are fighting. When females witness aggressive behavior between a pair of males, the female is more likely to be attracted to the male who won. In contrast, if a female did not \u201ceavesdrop\u201d on aggressive behavior between a pair of males, the female will show no preference in mate choice. In regards to the male fish, the \u201closer\u201d fish are more likely to attempt to court the fish who did not \u201ceavesdrop\u201d. The \u201cwinner\u201d fish have been found to show no preference in regards to female fish who \u201ceavesdropped\u201d and those who did not.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Herb|first1=Brodie M.|last2=Biron|first2=Suzanne A.|last3=Kidd|first3=Michael R.|title=Courtship By Subordinate Male Simease Fighting Fish, Betta Splendens: Their Response to Eavesdropping and Niave Females|journal=Behaviour|date=2003|volume=140|issue=1|pages=71\u201378|doi=10.1163/156853903763999908|jstor=4536011}}</ref>\n\nOne study considered the ways in which male Siamese fighting fish alter their behaviors during courtship when another male is present. During this experiment, a dummy female was placed in the tank. The researchers expected that males would conceal their courtship from intruders, however this surprisingly was not the case. It was found that when another male fish was present, the male was more likely to engage in courtship behaviors with the dummy female fish. When no barriers were present, the males were more likely to engage in gill flaring at an intruder male fish. Therefore, the researchers conclude that the male is attempting to court the female and communicate with the rival male present at the same time.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Dzieweczynski|first1=Teresa L.|last2=Lyman|first2=Sarah|last3=Poor|first3=Elysia A.|title=Male Siamese Fighting Fish, Betta Splendens, Increase Rather Than Conceal Courtship Behaviour When a Rival is Present|journal=Ethology|date=2008|volume=115|issue=2|pages=186\u2013195|doi=10.1111/j.1439-0310.2008.01602.x}}</ref> These results indicate the importance of considering courtship behavior, as the literature has suggested there are many factors that can dramatically affect the ways in which both male and females can act in courtship settings.\n\n===Metabolic costs of aggression===\nStudies have found that Siamese fighting fish often begin with behaviors that require high cost, and gradually decrease their behaviors as the encounter proceeds.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> This indicates that Siamese fighting fish will first begin an encounter using much metabolic energy, but will gradually decrease, as to not use too much energy, thus making the encounter a waste if the fish is not successful.  Similarly, researchers have found that when pairs of male Siamese fighting fish were kept together in the same tank for a three-day period, aggressive behavior was most prevalent during the mornings of the first two days of their cohabitation. However the researchers observed that the fighting between the two males decreased as the day progressed. The male in the dominant position initially had metabolic advantage; although as the experiment progressed, both fish became equal in regards to metabolic advantages.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Haller|first1=Jozesf|title=Biochemical Costs of a Three Day Long Cohabitation in Dominant and Submissive Male Betta Splenons|journal=Aggressive Behavior|date=1994|volume=20|issue=5|pages=369\u2013378|doi=10.1002/1098-2337(1994)20:5<369::aid-ab2480200504>3.0.co;2-f}}</ref> In regards to oxygen consumption, one study found that when two male Siamese fighting fish fought, the metabolic rates of both fish did not differ before or during the fight. However, the fish who won showed higher oxygen consumption during the evening subsequent to the fight.

Researchers have considered the effect that such chemicals can have on Siamese fighting fish. This section will examine three studies, each of which indicates that chemicals can significantly affect the behaviors of Siamese fighting fish. In particular, these behavior changes are most likely to occur in regards to aggression.\n\nOne study investigated the effect of [[testosterone]] on female Siamese fighting fish. Females were first given testosterone, which resulted in physical changes. This included fin length, body coloration and gonads. These physical changes resulted in the females resembling typical male fish. Next their aggressive behavior was monitored. It was found that when these females interacted with other females, their aggression increased. In contrast, when the females interacted with males, their aggressive behavior decreased. The researchers then allowed the female fish to interact socially with a group of other female fish, who had not been exposed to testosterone. It was found that when the female fish stopped receiving testosterone, those who were exposed to the female fish still exhibited the male typical behaviors. In contrast, the female fish who were kept isolated did not continue to exhibit the male typical behaviors after testosterone was discontinued.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Badura|first1=Lori L.|last2=Freidman|first2=Herbert|title=Sex Reversal in Female Betta Splendons as a Function of Testosterone Manipulation and Social Influence|journal=Journal of Comparative Psychology|date=1988|volume=102|issue=3|pages=262\u2013268|doi=10.1037/0735-7036.102.3.262|pmid=3180734}}</ref>\n\nAnother study exposed male Siamese fighting fish to [[Endocrine disruptor|endocrine-disrupting chemicals]]. The researchers were curious if exposure to these chemicals would affect the ways in which females respond to the exposed males. It was found that when shown videos of the exposed males, the females favored those who were not exposed to the endocrine-disrupting chemicals, and avoided those male who were exposed. Therefore, the researchers concluded that exposure to these chemicals can negatively affect the mating success of male Siamese fighting fish.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Dzieeczynski|first1=Teresea L.|last2=Kane|first2=Jessica L.|title=The Bachorlette: Female Siamese Fighting Fish Avoid Males Exposed to an Estrogen Mimic|journal=Behavioural Processes |date=2017|volume=140|pages=169\u2013173|doi=10.1016/j.beproc.2017.05.005|pmid=28478321}}</ref>\n\nThe last study investigated the effect of the [[SSRI]], [[fluoxetine]], on male Siamese fighting fish. It has been previously found that this chemical reduces aggressive behavior; therefore, researchers were curious if this would occur in their experiment. As predicted, it was found that when exposed to fluoxetine, male Siamese fighting fish exhibited less aggressive behavior than they would have if they had not been exposed to the chemical.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Eisenreich|first1=Benjamin|last2=Greene|first2=Susan|last3=Szalda-Petree|first3=Allen|title=Of Fish and Mirrors: Fluoxetine Disrupts Aggression and Learning For Social Rewards|journal=Physiology & Behavior|date=2017|volume=173|pages=258\u2013262|doi=10.1016/j.physbeh.2017.02.021|pmid=28237550}}</ref>\n\n==Name==\nAlthough commonly called a betta in the aquarium trade, especially in North America, that is the name of a genus not only containing this fish, but also other species. ''B. splendens'' is more accurately called by its scientific name or \"Siamese fighting fish\", to avoid confusion with the other species in the genus.\n\n==In popular culture==\n*The Fisheries Department of Thailand is promoting ''pla gud'', or Siamese fighting fish, as the national fish. Department chief Adisorn Promthep said that the proposal will be submitted to the National Identity Office under the Prime Minister's Office for approval. He said that once the status is recognised, fighting fish farming would be promoted, which would generate money and create jobs. He added that credible records show that ''pla gud'' of the ''[[Betta splendens]]'' species are native to Thailand and were first collected for fighting during the reign of King [[Rama III]].<ref>{{cite news |title='Pla gud' to be national fish |url=https://www.bangkokpost.com/news/general/1570858/pla-gud-to-be-national-fish |accessdate=6 November 2018 |newspaper=[[Bangkok Post]] |date=6 November 2018}}</ref>\n*The titular character in the novel ''[[Rumble Fish (novel)|Rumble Fish]]'' and subsequent [[Rumble Fish|film adaptation]] is a Siamese fighting fish.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hinton|first1=S.E.|title=Rumble Fish|publisher=Delacorte Press|isbn=978-0385375689|year=2013}}</ref> In both, the character Motorcycle Boy is fascinated with the creatures and dubs them \"rumble fish\".

Bettas are a member of the gourami family and are known to be highly territorial. Males in particular are prone to high levels of aggression and will attack each other if housed in the same tank. If there is no means of escape, this will usually result in the death of one or both of the fish.

([[Velvet (fish disease)|velvet disease]]), a common killer of betta fry in captivity.]]\n\nMale bettas will flare their gills, spread their fins and twist their bodies in a dance if interested in a female. If the female is also interested she will darken in color and develop vertical lines known as breeding bars as a response. Males build [[bubble nest]]s of various sizes and thicknesses at the surface of the water. Most tend to do this regularly even if there is no female present.\n\nPlants or rocks that break the surface often form a base for bubble nests. The act of spawning itself is called a \"nuptial embrace\", for the male wraps his body around the female; around 10\u201340 eggs are released during each embrace, until the female is exhausted of eggs. The male, in his turn, releases [[milt]] into the water, and fertilization takes place externally. During and after spawning, the male uses his mouth to retrieve sinking eggs and deposit them in the bubble nest (during mating the female sometimes assists her partner, but more often she simply devours all the eggs she manages to catch). Once the female has released all of her eggs, she is chased away from the male's territory, as she will likely eat the eggs.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.leaffin.com/betta-fish-breeding/|title=Betta Fish Spawn: Guide from Preparing Breeding Tank to Feeding the Fry|date=8 November 2017|website=Leaffin.com|accessdate=1 April 2019}}</ref>\nIf she is not removed from the tank then she will most likely be killed by the male.\n\nThe eggs will remain in the male's care. He carefully keeps them in his bubble nest, making sure none fall to the bottom, repairing the bubble nest as needed.  Incubation lasts for 24\u201336 hours; newly hatched larvae remain in the nest for the next two to three days until their yolk sacs are fully absorbed. Afterwards, the fry leave the nest and the free-swimming stage begins. In this first period of their lives, ''B. splendens'' fry are totally dependent on their gills; the [[labyrinth organ]] which allows the species to breathe atmospheric oxygen typically develops at three to six weeks of age, depending on the general growth rate, which can be highly variable. ''B. splendens'' can reach sexual maturity at an age as early as 4\u20135 months.\n{{clear}}\n\n==History==\n===Fighting fish===\nSome people of [[Thailand]] and [[Malaysia]] are known to have collected these fish prior to the 19th century from the wild which are line-bred for aggression in eastern Thailand.\n\nIn the wild, betta spar for only a few minutes before one fish backs off. Bred specifically for heightened aggression, domesticated betta matches can go on for much longer, with winners determined by a willingness to continue fighting. Once a fish retreats, the match is over. <!-- uncited, imprecise, needed?Large amounts of money are wagered during these fights, with potential losses as great as a person's home.-->\n\nSeeing the popularity of these fights, the king of [[Thailand]], [[Rama III]], started licensing and collecting these fighting fish. In 1840, he gave some of his prized fish to a man who, in turn, gave them to [[Theodore Edward Cantor]], a medical scientist. Nine years later, Cantor wrote an article describing them under the name ''Macropodus pugnax''.  In 1909, the [[Ichthyology|ichthyologist]] [[Charles Tate Regan]], upon realizing a species was already named ''[[Macropodus pugnax]]'', renamed the domesticated Siamese fighting fish ''Betta splendens''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Betta Origins|url=http://www.bettafishcenter.com/Betta-Origins.shtml|publisher=Betta Fish Center|accessdate=11 June 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe vernacular name \"plakat\", often applied to the short-finned ornamental strains, is derived from the Thai word ''pla kad'' (Thai: \u0e1b\u0e25\u0e32\u0e01\u0e31\u0e14), which literally means \"biting fish\" and is the [[Thai language|Thai]] name for all members of the ''B. splendens'' species complex (as all members have aggressive tendencies in the wild and all are extensively line-bred for aggression in eastern [[Thailand]]) rather than for any specific strain(s) of the Siamese fighting fish. So the term \"fighting fish\" comes in use to generalize all the members of the ''B. splendens'' species complex including the Siamese fighting fish.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.seriouslyfish.com/species/betta-splendens/|title=Betta splendens \u2013 Siamese Fighting Fish (Micracanthus marchei)|publisher=|accessdate=1 April 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.americanaquariumproducts.com/Bettas.html|title=Betta Fish Information; Plakats, Veiltails, Halfmoon, Crowntail|website=Americanaquariumproducts.com|accessdate=1 April 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Aquarium fish===\nIn 1892, this species was imported to France by the French aquarium fish importer [[Pierre Carbonnier]] in [[Paris]], and in 1896, the German aquarium fish importer [[Paul Matte]] in [[Berlin]] imported the first specimens to Germany from Moscow.\n\n===Invasive species===\nIn January 2014 a large population of the fish was discovered in the [[Adelaide River]] Floodplain in the Northern Territory, Australia.<ref name=fishes>{{cite web|last1=Bray|first1=Dianne|title=Siamese Fighting Fish, Betta splendens|url=http://www.fishesofaustralia.net.au/home/species/4919#summary|website=Fishes of Australia|accessdate=29 September 2014}}</ref>  As an invasive species they pose a threat to native fish, frogs and other wetland wildlife.<ref name=fishes />\n\n==In the aquarium==\n=== Water ===\n''Betta'' species prefer a water temperature of around {{convert|75|\u2013|82|F|C}} but have been seen to survive temporarily at the extremes of {{convert|56|F|C}} or {{convert|95|F|C}}.

The Betta must of course have enough room to turn around, but there is no evidence that they require a lot of space. Due to their labyrinth organ they are not dependent on high oxygen levels in the water, so a large surface area for gas exchange is not required.\nSome Betta enthusiasts claim that there is a minimum tank size for a Betta, but to try to set a strict baseline minimum is somewhat arbitrary.[http://www.reef2rainforest.com/2014/03/26/amazonas-videos-bettas-in-the-wild-what-they-tell-us-about-minimum-tank-sizes-for-bettas/].  Reliably performing regular partial water changes (every other day for small unfiltered tanks) would at least ensure the water quality in a smaller tank is acceptable.  Most consider 9 to 19 litres (2.5 - 5 US gallons) to be an ideal tank size for a Betta, \"but you can successfully keep a Betta in a 4 litre (1 gallon) tank provided you clean it regularly\" and maintain an acceptable temperature (generally 24\u00b0C to 26\u00b0C  - 75F to 78F - is considered optimal).<ref>{{Cite book|title=Betta Pals Betta Guide|last=Gordon|first=H|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\nBettas can cohabit with fish that are bottom feeders, however it is not advised to keep them with feeders that may eat their fins or destroy the slime coat (one example is the Siamese Algae Eater, if kept in an inappropriately sized tank)\n\n===Varieties===\n''B. splendens'' can be hybridized with [[Betta imbellis|''B. imbellis'']], ''[[Betta mahachaiensis|B. mahachaiensis]]'', and [[Betta smaragdina|''B. smaragdina'']], though with the latter, the fry tend to have low survival rates. In addition to these hybrids within the genus ''Betta'', intergeneric hybridizing of ''Betta splendens'' and ''Macropodus opercularis'', the paradise fish, has been reported.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eol.org/pages/211488/hierarchy_entries/57957257/details|title=Betta Splendens & Siamese Fighting Fish|publisher=|accessdate=1 April 2019}}</ref>\n\nBreeders around the world continue to develop new varieties. Often, the males of the species are sold preferentially in stores because of their beauty, compared to the females. Females almost never develop fins as showy as males of the same type and are often more subdued in coloration, though some breeders manage to get females with fairly long fins and bright colors.\n\n===Colors===\n[[File:Betta splendens pale.jpg|thumb|A dalmatian orange male]]\n<!--''B. splendens'' have been affectionately nicknamed \"the Jewel of the Orient\" due to their beauty and wide range of colours which are produced through [[selective breeding]].\n-->\nWild fish exhibit strong colours only when agitated.

Colours available to the aquarist include red, orange, yellow, blue, steel blue, turquoise/green, black, pastel, white (\"opaque\" white, not to be confused with albino) and multi-coloured fish.\n\nBettas are found in many different colours due to different layers of pigmentation in their skin. The layers (from furthest within to the outer layer) consists of red, yellow, black, iridescent (blue and green), and metallic (not a colour of its own, but reacts with the other colours to change how they are perceived). Any combination of these layers can be present, leading to a wide variety of colours.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Griffin |first=Gerald |date=January 2016 |title=Betta Primer |journal=Amazonas }}</ref>\n \nThe shades of blue, turquoise, and green are slightly [[iridescence|iridescent]], and can appear to change colour with different lighting conditions or viewing angles; this is because these colours (unlike black or red) are not due to [[biological pigment|pigments]], but created through refraction within a layer of translucent [[guanine]] crystals.

Other reasons for flaring can include when they are intimidated by movement or change of scene in their environments. Both sexes display pale horizontal bars if stressed or frightened. However, such colour changes, common in females of any age, are rare in mature males due to their intensity of colour. Females often flare at other females, especially when setting up a [[pecking order]]. [[Flirting]] fish behave similarly, with vertical instead of horizontal stripes indicating a willingness and readiness to breed (females only). ''Betta splendens'' enjoy a decorated tank, being a territorial fish it is necessary to establish territory even when housed alone. They may set up a territory centered on a plant or rocky alcove, sometimes becoming highly possessive of it and aggressive toward trespassing rivals. This is the reason why when kept with other fish the minimum tank size should be 45 litres (about 10 gallons). Contrary to popular belief, bettas are compatible with many other species of aquarium fish.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aquariphiles.com/betta-tank-mates/ |title=7 Excellent Betta Tank Mates for Your Siamese Fighting Fish |date= |accessdate=2015-08-20}}</ref> Given the proper parameters bettas will be known to only be aggressive towards smaller and slower fish than themselves such as [[Guppy|guppies]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.earthsfriends.com/betta-fish-facts/ |title=Betta Fish Facts |website=Earthsfriends.com|date= |accessdate=2015-08-20}}</ref>\n\nThe aggression of this fish has been studied by [[ethology|ethologists]] and [[comparative psychology|comparative psychologists]].<ref>{{cite journal | author=Bronstein, Paul M. | journal = American Journal of Psychology | title = Agonistic Sequences and the Assessment of Opponents in Male ''Betta splendens''|jstor=1422809 | year = 1998 | volume = 265 | pages=163\u2013177 | issue=2}}</ref> These fish have historically been the objects of gambling; two male fish are pitted against each other to fight and bets are placed on which one will win. One fish will arise the victor, the fight continuing until one participant is submissive. These competitions can result in the death of either one or both fish depending on the seriousness of their injuries. To avoid fights over territory, male Siamese fighting fish are best isolated from one another. Males will occasionally even respond aggressively to their own reflections in a mirror. Though this is obviously safer than exposing the fish to another male, prolonged sight of their reflection may lead to stress in some individuals. Not all Siamese fighting fish respond negatively to other males, especially when the tank is large enough for each fish to create their own designated territory.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fishkeepingadvice.com/betta-fish-care/ |title=Complete Betta Fish Care Guide (Tank, Diet & Aggression) |date= |accessdate=2016-03-03}}</ref>\n[[File:Female bettas in community tank.jpg|thumb|Several females in a [[Community aquarium|community tank]] with [[Poecilia|mollies]] and [[rainbowfish]]]]\n\n===Aggressive behavior in females===\nIn general, studies have shown that females exhibit similar aggressive behaviors as their male counterparts, but these behaviors are less common.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Elcoro|first1=Mirari|last2=Da Silva|first2=Stephanie|last3=Lattal|first3=Kennon|title=Visual Reinforcement in the Female Siamese Fighting Fish, Betta Splendens|journal= Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior|date=2008|volume=90|issue=1|pages=53\u201360|doi=10.1901/jeab.2008.90-53|pmid=18683612|pmc=2441580}}</ref> A group of female Siamese fighting fish were observed over a period of two weeks.

This research has focused on the aggressive behaviors of males during the courtship process. For example, one study found that when male fish are in the bubble nest phase, their aggression toward females is quite low. This is due to the males attempting to attract potential mates to their nest, so eggs can successfully be laid.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite journal|last1=Forsatkar|first1=Mohammad|last2=Nematollahi|first2=Mohammad|last3=Bron|first3=Culum|title=Male Siamese Fighting Fish Use Gill Flaring As The First Display Towards Territorial Intruders|journal=Journal of Ethology|date=August 2016|doi=10.1007/s10164-016-0489-1|volume=35|pages=51\u201359}}</ref> It has also been found that in regards to mate choice, females often \u201ceavesdrop\u201d on pairs of male Siamese fighting fish while they are fighting.

When no barriers were present, the males were more likely to engage in gill flaring at an intruder male fish. Therefore, the researchers conclude that the male is attempting to court the female and communicate with the rival male present at the same time.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Dzieweczynski|first1=Teresa L.|last2=Lyman|first2=Sarah|last3=Poor|first3=Elysia A.|title=Male Siamese Fighting Fish, Betta Splendens, Increase Rather Than Conceal Courtship Behaviour When a Rival is Present|journal=Ethology|date=2008|volume=115|issue=2|pages=186\u2013195|doi=10.1111/j.1439-0310.2008.01602.x}}</ref> These results indicate the importance of considering courtship behavior, as the literature has suggested there are many factors that can dramatically affect the ways in which both male and females can act in courtship settings.\n\n===Metabolic costs of aggression===\nStudies have found that Siamese fighting fish often begin with behaviors that require high cost, and gradually decrease their behaviors as the encounter proceeds.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> This indicates that Siamese fighting fish will first begin an encounter using much metabolic energy, but will gradually decrease, as to not use too much energy, thus making the encounter a waste if the fish is not successful.  Similarly, researchers have found that when pairs of male Siamese fighting fish were kept together in the same tank for a three-day period, aggressive behavior was most prevalent during the mornings of the first two days of their cohabitation. However the researchers observed that the fighting between the two males decreased as the day progressed. The male in the dominant position initially had metabolic advantage; although as the experiment progressed, both fish became equal in regards to metabolic advantages.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Haller|first1=Jozesf|title=Biochemical Costs of a Three Day Long Cohabitation in Dominant and Submissive Male Betta Splenons|journal=Aggressive Behavior|date=1994|volume=20|issue=5|pages=369\u2013378|doi=10.1002/1098-2337(1994)20:5<369::aid-ab2480200504>3.0.co;2-f}}</ref> In regards to oxygen consumption, one study found that when two male Siamese fighting fish fought, the metabolic rates of both fish did not differ before or during the fight. However, the fish who won showed higher oxygen consumption during the evening subsequent to the fight. Therefore, the results of this study indicate that aggressive behavior in the form of fighting has long-lasting effects on metabolism.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Castro|first1=Nidia|last2=Ros|first2=Albert F.H.|last3=Becker|first3=Klaus|last4=Oliveira|first4=Rui F.|title=Metabolic Costs of Aggressive Behaviour in the Siamese Fighting Fish, Betta Splendons|journal=Aggressive Behavior|date=2006|volume=32|issue=5|pages=474\u2013480|doi=10.1002/ab.20147|hdl=10400.12/1283|hdl-access=free}}</ref>\n\n===Effects of chemical exposure on behavior===\nChemicals such as hormones can have powerful effects on the behavior of an individual. Researchers have considered the effect that such chemicals can have on Siamese fighting fish. This section will examine three studies, each of which indicates that chemicals can significantly affect the behaviors of Siamese fighting fish. In particular, these behavior changes are most likely to occur in regards to aggression.\n\nOne study investigated the effect of [[testosterone]] on female Siamese fighting fish. Females were first given testosterone, which resulted in physical changes. This included fin length, body coloration and gonads. These physical changes resulted in the females resembling typical male fish. Next their aggressive behavior was monitored. It was found that when these females interacted with other females, their aggression increased. In contrast, when the females interacted with males, their aggressive behavior decreased. The researchers then allowed the female fish to interact socially with a group of other female fish, who had not been exposed to testosterone. It was found that when the female fish stopped receiving testosterone, those who were exposed to the female fish still exhibited the male typical behaviors. In contrast, the female fish who were kept isolated did not continue to exhibit the male typical behaviors after testosterone was discontinued.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Badura|first1=Lori L.|last2=Freidman|first2=Herbert|title=Sex Reversal in Female Betta Splendons as a Function of Testosterone Manipulation and Social Influence|journal=Journal of Comparative Psychology|date=1988|volume=102|issue=3|pages=262\u2013268|doi=10.1037/0735-7036.102.3.262|pmid=3180734}}</ref>\n\nAnother study exposed male Siamese fighting fish to [[Endocrine disruptor|endocrine-disrupting chemicals]]. The researchers were curious if exposure to these chemicals would affect the ways in which females respond to the exposed males. It was found that when shown videos of the exposed males, the females favored those who were not exposed to the endocrine-disrupting chemicals, and avoided those male who were exposed. Therefore, the researchers concluded that exposure to these chemicals can negatively affect the mating success of male Siamese fighting fish.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Dzieeczynski|first1=Teresea L.|last2=Kane|first2=Jessica L.|title=The Bachorlette: Female Siamese Fighting Fish Avoid Males Exposed to an Estrogen Mimic|journal=Behavioural Processes |date=2017|volume=140|pages=169\u2013173|doi=10.1016/j.beproc.2017.05.005|pmid=28478321}}</ref>\n\nThe last study investigated the effect of the [[SSRI]], [[fluoxetine]], on male Siamese fighting fish. It has been previously found that this chemical reduces aggressive behavior; therefore, researchers were curious if this would occur in their experiment. As predicted, it was found that when exposed to fluoxetine, male Siamese fighting fish exhibited less aggressive behavior than they would have if they had not been exposed to the chemical.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Eisenreich|first1=Benjamin|last2=Greene|first2=Susan|last3=Szalda-Petree|first3=Allen|title=Of Fish and Mirrors: Fluoxetine Disrupts Aggression and Learning For Social Rewards|journal=Physiology & Behavior|date=2017|volume=173|pages=258\u2013262|doi=10.1016/j.physbeh.2017.02.021|pmid=28237550}}</ref>\n\n==Name==\nAlthough commonly called a betta in the aquarium trade, especially in North America, that is the name of a genus not only containing this fish, but also other species. ''B. splendens'' is more accurately called by its scientific name or \"Siamese fighting fish\", to avoid confusion with the other species in the genus.\n\n==In popular culture==\n*The Fisheries Department of Thailand is promoting ''pla gud'', or Siamese fighting fish, as the national fish. Department chief Adisorn Promthep said that the proposal will be submitted to the National Identity Office under the Prime Minister's Office for approval. He said that once the status is recognised, fighting fish farming would be promoted, which would generate money and create jobs. He added that credible records show that ''pla gud'' of the ''[[Betta splendens]]'' species are native to Thailand and were first collected for fighting during the reign of King [[Rama III]].<ref>{{cite news |title='Pla gud' to be national fish |url=https://www.bangkokpost.com/news/general/1570858/pla-gud-to-be-national-fish |accessdate=6 November 2018 |newspaper=[[Bangkok Post]] |date=6 November 2018}}</ref>\n*The titular character in the novel ''[[Rumble Fish (novel)|Rumble Fish]]'' and subsequent [[Rumble Fish|film adaptation]] is a Siamese fighting fish.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hinton|first1=S.E.|title=Rumble Fish|publisher=Delacorte Press|isbn=978-0385375689|year=2013}}</ref> In both, the character Motorcycle Boy is fascinated with the creatures and dubs them \"rumble fish\". He speculates that if the fish were to be set free in the river, they wouldn't behave so aggressively. A common misconception regarding keeping ''B. splendens'' is that they should live in vases or bowls. However, this has been proven to damage their health, life expectancy, and cause negative behavioral changes.<ref>{{cite web|title=Why betta bowls are bad|url=http://www.aquariadise.com/why-betta-bowls-are-bad/|website=Aquariadis.come|accessdate=18 January 2018}}</ref>\n*A scene in the [[James Bond]] film ''[[From Russia with Love (film)|From Russia with Love]]'' shows three Siamese fighting fish in an aquarium as the villain [[Ernst Stavro Blofeld]] likens the ''modus operandi'' of his criminal organisation, [[SPECTRE]], to one of the fish that observes as the other two fight to the death, then kills the weakened victor.<ref>{{cite book |title=Bond on Bond: The Ultimate Book on 50 Years of Bond Movies |first=Roger |last=Moore |date=2012 |chapter=The Spector of Evil |publisher=Michael O'Mara Books |isbn=978-1843178613 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/bondonbondultima0000moor }}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite journal | last1 = Simpson | first1 = M.
