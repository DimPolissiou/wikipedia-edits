There, they are greeted by [[Simeon (Gospel of Luke)|Simeon]], who blesses Jesus as the Christ. At the age of twelve, Jesus becomes separated from his parents during a [[Passover]] trip to Jerusalem. When Mary asks about his whereabouts, Jesus tells them that he was in [[God|His Father]]'s house. Years later, during the reign of Emperor [[Tiberius]] and King [[Herod Antipas]], John the Baptist baptizes Jesus in the [[Jordan River]] and the [[Holy Spirit]] descends upon Jesus.\n\nJesus is subsequently [[Temptation of Christ|tempted]] in the wilderness by [[Satan]] but withstands the Devil's trials. Travelling to [[Capernaum]], Jesus recruits the disciples [[Saint Peter|Peter]], [[Simeon (Gospel of Luke)|James]], and [[John the Apostle|John]] after helping them to find a large haul of fish. During his preaching ministry, Jesus [[Raising of Jairus' daughter|resurrects]] the daughter of Jairus. Jesus then recruits twelve [[apostle]]s from among His disciples including [[Matthew the Apostle|Matthew]] and [[Judas Iscariot]]. Jesus' followers also include several women including [[Mary Magdalene]], [[Joanna, wife of Chuza|Joanna]], and [[Susanna (disciple)|Susanna]].\n\nThe film covers several of Jesus' teachings and messages including the [[Pharisee and the Publican|parable of the Pharisee and the tax collector]], the [[Beatitudes]], the [[Golden Rule]], loving your enemy, and the [[Parable of the Sower]]. While visiting the home of the [[Pharisee]] [[Simon the Pharisee|Simon]], a sinful woman [[Anointing of Jesus|anoints]] Jesus' feet, prompting Jesus to forgive her sins. Jesus and his disciples later travel across the [[Sea of Galilee]] where he calms the storm. At [[Gerasa]], Jesus [[Exorcism of the Gerasene demoniac|exorcises]] a demon-possessed man and the demons enter a herd of swine. At [[Bethsaida]], Jesus [[Feeding the multitude|feeds]] five thousand with five loaves and two pieces of fish. Later, Jesus and his disciples travel up a mountain where Jesus encounters the prophets [[Moses]] and [[Elijah]] and is [[Transfiguration of Jesus|transfigured]].\n\nAs Jesus' preaching and healing ministry grows, he reaches out to the sinners and outcasts including prostitutes and tax collectors, earning the ire of the Pharisees and religious teachers. Jesus also befriends the tax collector [[Zaccheus]], convincing him to repay people he has extorted. While preaching the [[Parable of the Good Samaritan]], Jesus befriends a little girl and tells his disciples not to forbid the little children from coming to Him. Jesus draws the attention of the Pharisees, Jewish religious leaders, and Romans after he drives the merchants out of the Temple. In Jerusalem, Jesus teaches the [[Parable of the Wicked Husbandmen|Parable of the Tenants]] and to pay taxes to Caesar. At the [[Last Supper]], Jesus warns his disciples of his impending betrayal and death. Judas conspires with the religious leaders to betray Jesus.\n\nAt the [[Gethsemane|Garden of Gethsemane]], Jesus is betrayed by Judas and captured by the Jewish authorities. [[Denial of Peter|Peter denies knowing Jesus]] three times before the cock crows. The following day, Jesus is condemned by the religious leaders. He is then brought before by [[Pontius Pilate]], who sends him to Herod. While Pilate exonerates Jesus of wrongdoing, the Jesus leaders and crowd demand Jesus' death. After being scourged, Jesus is forced to carry his cross through the streets. When he collapses from exhaustion, [[Simon of Cyrene]] is obliged to carry his cross. At [[Calvary|Golgotha]], Jesus is crucified besides two robbers, one of whom recognizes him as the Messiah. Following Jesus' death at noon, the sky is plunged into darkness and the curtain of the Temple is ripped through the middle. [[Joseph of Arimathea]] buries Jesus in a tomb. Jesus rises from the dead on the third day. Before [[Ascension of Jesus|ascending]] back to [[Heaven]], Jesus tells his disciples that all power and authority has been given to Him and commands them to go and make disciples of all nations.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Brian Deacon]] as [[Jesus]]\n* [[Rivka Neumann]] as [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] \n* [[Yosef Shiloach]] as [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]]\n* [[Talia Shapira]] as [[Mary Magdalene]]\n* [[Alexander Scourby]] as [[Saint Luke|Luke]]\n* [[Niko Nitai]] as [[Simon Peter]]\n* [[Ori Levy]] as [[Caiaphas]]\n* [[Mosko Alkalai]] as [[Saint Matthew|Matthew]]\n* [[Kobi Assaf]] as [[Philip the Apostle|Philip]]\n* [[Moti Baharav]] as [[Simon of Cyrene]]\n* [[Ya'ackov Ben-Sira]] as [[Zacchaeus]]\n* [[Ze'ev Berlinski]] as Blind Beggar\n* [[Eli Cohen (actor)|Eli Cohen]] as [[John the Baptist]]\n* [[Eli Danker]] as [[Judas Iscariot]]\n* [[Dina Doron]] as [[Elizabeth (biblical figure)|Elizabeth]]\n* [[Shoshana Duer]] as the hunchback woman in the temple\n* [[Peter Frye]] as [[Pontius Pilate]]\n* [[Nisim Gerama]] as [[Thomas the Apostle|Thomas]]\n* David Goldberg as [[Jude the Apostle|Judas]], son of James\n* [[Timothy Mark Hanson]] as the rich young ruler\n* [[Yftach Katzur]] as the epileptic boy\n* [[Rula Lenska]] as [[Herodias]]\n* [[Avi Loziah]] as the demonic man\n* [[Miki Mfir]] as [[Simon the Pharisee]]\n* [[Yitzhak Ne'eman]] as [[James, brother of Jesus|James]]\n* [[Shmuel Ornstein]] as [[Simon Peter|Simeon]]\n* [[Richard Peterson (actor)|Richard Peterson]] as [[Herod Antipas]]\n* [[Milo Rafi]] as [[Simon Zelotes]]\n* [[Shmuel Rodensky]] as [[Annas]]\n* [[Gad Roll]] as [[Saint Andrew|Andrew]]\n* [[Israel Rubinek]] as [[Joseph of Arimathea]]\n* [[Michael Schneider (actor)|Michael Schneider]] as the father of the epileptic boy\n* [[Nahum Shalit]] as [[Jairus]]\n* [[Shmuel Tal]] as [[John the Evangelist|John]]\n* [[Michael Warshaviak]] as [[Saint Bartholomew|Bartholomew]]\n* [[Leonid Weinstein]] as James, son of Alphaeus\n* [[Rolf Brin]] as the centurian in charge of the [[Crucifixion]]\n* [[Dov Friedman]] as the soldier nailing sign to cross\n* [[Oshik Levi]] as Desmas, Good Thief on Cross\n* [[Nissan Nativ]] as John's disciple\n* Kevin O'Shea as Gestas, bad thief on cross\n* [[Yossi Pollak]] as the ruler of the [[Synagogue]]\n* [[Dada Rubin]] as the herdsmen\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n[[Bill Bright]], founder of the [[Campus Crusade for Christ]], spent a lot of time in his early career trying to convert Hollywood celebrities in [[Los Angeles]], and he aspired to make a compelling film about the life of Christ. In 1976, the [[British Jews|British Jewish]] film and television producer [[John Heyman]] approached Bright to fund his Genesis Project to put the entire Bible on film and to obtain financing for his feature-length film on Jesus. After meeting Heyman, Bright asked the-then campus ministry director Paul Eshleman to consult with the filmmaker.\n\nEshleman was pleased with Heyman's short film on the first two chapters of the [[Gospel of Luke]] and convince Bright to endorse the project despite objections from other Campus Crusade leaders who objected to a non-Christian making a film about the Bible. Most of the film's dialogue comes from Luke, which was chosen after Heyman sought advice from [[clergy]] and scholars.{{sfn|Turner|2008|181-182}} On his motivation about the Jesus film, Heyman said: \"I believed the best-selling book in the world would sell a lot of 8-millimeter and 16-millimeter films.\" Instead of creating a parallel story for the film or embellishing the biblical account, as is the case with other biblical films such as ''[[The Ten Commandments (1956 film)|The Ten Commandments]]'' or ''[[The Greatest Story Ever Told]]'', the filmmakers chose to adhere as closely as possible to the [[Gospel of Luke]].<ref name=\"nytimes1\"/>\n\nAfter failing to canvass funding from Hollywood studios, the ''Jesus'' film would be financed primarily by Campus Crusade supporters [[Nelson Bunker Hunt|Bunker and Caroline Hunt]] for a sum of $6 million.<ref>Come Help Change the World, by Bill Bright, pages 144-145</ref><ref>Jesus, the Gospels, and Cinematic Imagination Jeffrey Lloyd Staley, Richard G.

In addition to 45 main actors, who were mainly Israelis, another 5,000 extras were involved in the filming. The filmmakers cast [[Yemenite Jews]] as [[Extra (acting)|background extras]] because, according to Eshleman, \"their facial features have changed the least over 2,000 years.\" Filming began late November, 1978 on location in [[Tiberias]], Israel, which continued for 31 weeks throughout the country, including the cities of [[Tel Aviv]] and [[Jerusalem]]. During the production, Heyman revealed that the filmmakers \"were required to [[Pick-up (filmmaking)|re-film]] three days' work,\" because they \"had shown [[eucalyptus tree]]s in a variety of shots,\" when, \"Eucalyptus trees were introduced to Palestine very much later\".<ref name=\"nytimes1\"/>\n\nDeacon grew his hair and beard during the production, but producer Jon Heyman had decided for Deacon to wear a wig over his hair, and as well as a [[prosthetic]] nose so that he had a [[Mediterranean race|Mediterranean look]]. Former [[Jesus Film Project]] director Paul Eshleman, who was on location during much of the principal photography, revealed in the [[DVD]]'s [[audio commentary]] that Deacon was so committed to the film and its message that he read several [[Bible translations]] a day in order to make certain that he properly presented Christ's teachings.<ref>DVD audio commentary</ref> Because Deacon developed [[pneumonia]] during principal photography, doubles were used in certain scenes. Deacon's dialogue mostly comprises full-length passages of scripture, and he is scarcely depicted doing anything other than making miracles and uttering speeches.<ref name=\"nytimes1\"/>\n\nEshleman revealed that Niko Nitai, the actor who played Peter, became a believer during the shooting. As for special effects, the film features puffs of smoke and transparent [[Halo (religious iconography)|halos]] to indicate miracles and angel figures, and a hissing snake and a deep voiceover represent Satan.<ref name=\"nytimes1\"/> Heyman's original cut of the ''Jesus'' film ran for more than four hours. However, in consultation with Bright and Eshleman, he edited a shorter version for Campus Crusade. Just after filming, Heyman was not satisfied with the native dialect of the [[Israeli people|Israeli]] cast members and decided that they all should be [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbed]] over by [[English people|English]] voice actors using the [[Received Pronunciation]] accent.{{sfn|Turner|2008|183}}\n\n==Release==\n''Jesus'' was released by [[Warner Bros.]] in the [[United States]] in over 2000 cinemas, which delineated a rare instance of a major studio releasing an \u201covertly religious picture.\u201d<ref name=\"AFI CATALOG OF FEATURE FILMS\"/> To promote the film, Paul Eshleman worked with both [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] and [[Catholic]] churches to arrange group trips and discounts. Four million viewers reportedly watch the ''Jesus'' film in late 1979 and 1980. However, though the film was popular with Christian audiences, it failed to attract mainstream audiences. It was not a financial success and left John Heyman's Genesis Project US$4 million in debt.{{sfn|Turner|2008|183-184}}\n\nThe release date varied between countries; In [[Australia]], it was released on April 3, 1980; in [[Portugal]] on April 9, 1981; in [[Sweden]] on November 1, 1985; in [[Finland]] on March 14, 1986; in [[Hungary]] on 13 December 1990; and in [[Czechoslovakia]] in 1991.

Being less violent than the original, it was interwoven into an edited version of the original film ''Jesus'' and released in 2000. In 2001, a new opening sequence depicting the [[Creationism|creation of humans]], the expulsion from [[Garden of Eden|Eden]], [[Abraham]]'s blocked [[Human sacrifice|sacrifice]] of his son, and the prophesies of [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] was filmed to show, as Paul Eshleman states in the audio commentary, how Jesus' life fits into the span of history. In 2002, a special edition of ''Jesus'' commemorating the [[September 11 attacks]] was distributed in the [[VHS]] format. It contains introductions by [[New York City]] [[New York City Fire Department|firefighters]] and [[New York Police Department|police officers]] and has a running time of 83 minutes.\n\n;2003\nAn edited [[DVD]] version of ''Jesus'' was also packaged with ''JESUS: Fact or Fiction?'', which was produced in 2003 by Inspirational Films. This features a section called the \"Journey of Spiritual Discovery\". Biblical scholars, historians, philosophers, authors, and ministers answer specific questions relating to God, Jesus, Christianity, the archaeological, scientific and historical accuracy of the Bible, and testimony from many Christians. Viewers can browse the numerous topics individually or they can watch the film and, when prompted by a \"discovery glass\" icon, can access relevant comments.

Heyman also objected to Campus Crusade making multiple different versions of his film. When Campus Crusade produced a shorter version ''The Story of Jesus for Children'', which included new footage, Heyman sued Crusade on the grounds that the new version damaged his reputation. Though the dispute was settled by the parties out of court, relations between Heyman and Campus Crusade remained poor.{{sfn|Turner|2008|184}}\n\nRegarding the foreign reception, documentary maker Seghal said \"The events we witnessed were often bewildering,\" he says. \"But what struck us most was the utter normality of those who were willing to risk their lives for Christ.\"<ref name=\"BBC News\"/> After the film's reels were sent to remote settlements in Africa, Asia and Latin America, they returned with reports of audiences being in tears during screening with others instantly [[Religious conversion|converting]].

Later, Mary visits [[Elizabeth (biblical figure)|Elizabeth]], the mother of [[John the Baptist]], who tells her that she is the most blessed of women and that her child is blessed.\n\nWhen the Romans hold a census, Mary travels with her husband [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]] to his hometown of [[Bethlehem]] to register. There, Jesus is born in a manger. A week later, Mary and Joseph travel to [[Jerusalem]] to present Jesus at the [[Second Temple|Temple]]. There, they are greeted by [[Simeon (Gospel of Luke)|Simeon]], who blesses Jesus as the Christ. At the age of twelve, Jesus becomes separated from his parents during a [[Passover]] trip to Jerusalem. When Mary asks about his whereabouts, Jesus tells them that he was in [[God|His Father]]'s house. Years later, during the reign of Emperor [[Tiberius]] and King [[Herod Antipas]], John the Baptist baptizes Jesus in the [[Jordan River]] and the [[Holy Spirit]] descends upon Jesus.\n\nJesus is subsequently [[Temptation of Christ|tempted]] in the wilderness by [[Satan]] but withstands the Devil's trials. Travelling to [[Capernaum]], Jesus recruits the disciples [[Saint Peter|Peter]], [[Simeon (Gospel of Luke)|James]], and [[John the Apostle|John]] after helping them to find a large haul of fish. During his preaching ministry, Jesus [[Raising of Jairus' daughter|resurrects]] the daughter of Jairus. Jesus then recruits twelve [[apostle]]s from among His disciples including [[Matthew the Apostle|Matthew]] and [[Judas Iscariot]]. Jesus' followers also include several women including [[Mary Magdalene]], [[Joanna, wife of Chuza|Joanna]], and [[Susanna (disciple)|Susanna]].\n\nThe film covers several of Jesus' teachings and messages including the [[Pharisee and the Publican|parable of the Pharisee and the tax collector]], the [[Beatitudes]], the [[Golden Rule]], loving your enemy, and the [[Parable of the Sower]]. While visiting the home of the [[Pharisee]] [[Simon the Pharisee|Simon]], a sinful woman [[Anointing of Jesus|anoints]] Jesus' feet, prompting Jesus to forgive her sins. Jesus and his disciples later travel across the [[Sea of Galilee]] where he calms the storm. At [[Gerasa]], Jesus [[Exorcism of the Gerasene demoniac|exorcises]] a demon-possessed man and the demons enter a herd of swine. At [[Bethsaida]], Jesus [[Feeding the multitude|feeds]] five thousand with five loaves and two pieces of fish. Later, Jesus and his disciples travel up a mountain where Jesus encounters the prophets [[Moses]] and [[Elijah]] and is [[Transfiguration of Jesus|transfigured]].\n\nAs Jesus' preaching and healing ministry grows, he reaches out to the sinners and outcasts including prostitutes and tax collectors, earning the ire of the Pharisees and religious teachers. Jesus also befriends the tax collector [[Zaccheus]], convincing him to repay people he has extorted. While preaching the [[Parable of the Good Samaritan]], Jesus befriends a little girl and tells his disciples not to forbid the little children from coming to Him. Jesus draws the attention of the Pharisees, Jewish religious leaders, and Romans after he drives the merchants out of the Temple. In Jerusalem, Jesus teaches the [[Parable of the Wicked Husbandmen|Parable of the Tenants]] and to pay taxes to Caesar. At the [[Last Supper]], Jesus warns his disciples of his impending betrayal and death. Judas conspires with the religious leaders to betray Jesus.\n\nAt the [[Gethsemane|Garden of Gethsemane]], Jesus is betrayed by Judas and captured by the Jewish authorities. [[Denial of Peter|Peter denies knowing Jesus]] three times before the cock crows. The following day, Jesus is condemned by the religious leaders. He is then brought before by [[Pontius Pilate]], who sends him to Herod. While Pilate exonerates Jesus of wrongdoing, the Jesus leaders and crowd demand Jesus' death. After being scourged, Jesus is forced to carry his cross through the streets. When he collapses from exhaustion, [[Simon of Cyrene]] is obliged to carry his cross. At [[Calvary|Golgotha]], Jesus is crucified besides two robbers, one of whom recognizes him as the Messiah. Following Jesus' death at noon, the sky is plunged into darkness and the curtain of the Temple is ripped through the middle. [[Joseph of Arimathea]] buries Jesus in a tomb. Jesus rises from the dead on the third day. Before [[Ascension of Jesus|ascending]] back to [[Heaven]], Jesus tells his disciples that all power and authority has been given to Him and commands them to go and make disciples of all nations.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Brian Deacon]] as [[Jesus]]\n* [[Rivka Neumann]] as [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] \n* [[Yosef Shiloach]] as [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]]\n* [[Talia Shapira]] as [[Mary Magdalene]]\n* [[Alexander Scourby]] as [[Saint Luke|Luke]]\n* [[Niko Nitai]] as [[Simon Peter]]\n* [[Ori Levy]] as [[Caiaphas]]\n* [[Mosko Alkalai]] as [[Saint Matthew|Matthew]]\n* [[Kobi Assaf]] as [[Philip the Apostle|Philip]]\n* [[Moti Baharav]] as [[Simon of Cyrene]]\n* [[Ya'ackov Ben-Sira]] as [[Zacchaeus]]\n* [[Ze'ev Berlinski]] as Blind Beggar\n* [[Eli Cohen (actor)|Eli Cohen]] as [[John the Baptist]]\n* [[Eli Danker]] as [[Judas Iscariot]]\n* [[Dina Doron]] as [[Elizabeth (biblical figure)|Elizabeth]]\n* [[Shoshana Duer]] as the hunchback woman in the temple\n* [[Peter Frye]] as [[Pontius Pilate]]\n* [[Nisim Gerama]] as [[Thomas the Apostle|Thomas]]\n* David Goldberg as [[Jude the Apostle|Judas]], son of James\n* [[Timothy Mark Hanson]] as the rich young ruler\n* [[Yftach Katzur]] as the epileptic boy\n* [[Rula Lenska]] as [[Herodias]]\n* [[Avi Loziah]] as the demonic man\n* [[Miki Mfir]] as [[Simon the Pharisee]]\n* [[Yitzhak Ne'eman]] as [[James, brother of Jesus|James]]\n* [[Shmuel Ornstein]] as [[Simon Peter|Simeon]]\n* [[Richard Peterson (actor)|Richard Peterson]] as [[Herod Antipas]]\n* [[Milo Rafi]] as [[Simon Zelotes]]\n* [[Shmuel Rodensky]] as [[Annas]]\n* [[Gad Roll]] as [[Saint Andrew|Andrew]]\n* [[Israel Rubinek]] as [[Joseph of Arimathea]]\n* [[Michael Schneider (actor)|Michael Schneider]] as the father of the epileptic boy\n* [[Nahum Shalit]] as [[Jairus]]\n* [[Shmuel Tal]] as [[John the Evangelist|John]]\n* [[Michael Warshaviak]] as [[Saint Bartholomew|Bartholomew]]\n* [[Leonid Weinstein]] as James, son of Alphaeus\n* [[Rolf Brin]] as the centurian in charge of the [[Crucifixion]]\n* [[Dov Friedman]] as the soldier nailing sign to cross\n* [[Oshik Levi]] as Desmas, Good Thief on Cross\n* [[Nissan Nativ]] as John's disciple\n* Kevin O'Shea as Gestas, bad thief on cross\n* [[Yossi Pollak]] as the ruler of the [[Synagogue]]\n* [[Dada Rubin]] as the herdsmen\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n[[Bill Bright]], founder of the [[Campus Crusade for Christ]], spent a lot of time in his early career trying to convert Hollywood celebrities in [[Los Angeles]], and he aspired to make a compelling film about the life of Christ. In 1976, the [[British Jews|British Jewish]] film and television producer [[John Heyman]] approached Bright to fund his Genesis Project to put the entire Bible on film and to obtain financing for his feature-length film on Jesus. After meeting Heyman, Bright asked the-then campus ministry director Paul Eshleman to consult with the filmmaker.\n\nEshleman was pleased with Heyman's short film on the first two chapters of the [[Gospel of Luke]] and convince Bright to endorse the project despite objections from other Campus Crusade leaders who objected to a non-Christian making a film about the Bible. Most of the film's dialogue comes from Luke, which was chosen after Heyman sought advice from [[clergy]] and scholars.{{sfn|Turner|2008|181-182}} On his motivation about the Jesus film, Heyman said: \"I believed the best-selling book in the world would sell a lot of 8-millimeter and 16-millimeter films.\" Instead of creating a parallel story for the film or embellishing the biblical account, as is the case with other biblical films such as ''[[The Ten Commandments (1956 film)|The Ten Commandments]]'' or ''[[The Greatest Story Ever Told]]'', the filmmakers chose to adhere as closely as possible to the [[Gospel of Luke]].<ref name=\"nytimes1\"/>\n\nAfter failing to canvass funding from Hollywood studios, the ''Jesus'' film would be financed primarily by Campus Crusade supporters [[Nelson Bunker Hunt|Bunker and Caroline Hunt]] for a sum of $6 million.<ref>Come Help Change the World, by Bill Bright, pages 144-145</ref><ref>Jesus, the Gospels, and Cinematic Imagination Jeffrey Lloyd Staley, Richard G.

In addition to 45 main actors, who were mainly Israelis, another 5,000 extras were involved in the filming. The filmmakers cast [[Yemenite Jews]] as [[Extra (acting)|background extras]] because, according to Eshleman, \"their facial features have changed the least over 2,000 years.\" Filming began late November, 1978 on location in [[Tiberias]], Israel, which continued for 31 weeks throughout the country, including the cities of [[Tel Aviv]] and [[Jerusalem]]. During the production, Heyman revealed that the filmmakers \"were required to [[Pick-up (filmmaking)|re-film]] three days' work,\" because they \"had shown [[eucalyptus tree]]s in a variety of shots,\" when, \"Eucalyptus trees were introduced to Palestine very much later\".<ref name=\"nytimes1\"/>\n\nDeacon grew his hair and beard during the production, but producer Jon Heyman had decided for Deacon to wear a wig over his hair, and as well as a [[prosthetic]] nose so that he had a [[Mediterranean race|Mediterranean look]]. Former [[Jesus Film Project]] director Paul Eshleman, who was on location during much of the principal photography, revealed in the [[DVD]]'s [[audio commentary]] that Deacon was so committed to the film and its message that he read several [[Bible translations]] a day in order to make certain that he properly presented Christ's teachings.<ref>DVD audio commentary</ref> Because Deacon developed [[pneumonia]] during principal photography, doubles were used in certain scenes. Deacon's dialogue mostly comprises full-length passages of scripture, and he is scarcely depicted doing anything other than making miracles and uttering speeches.<ref name=\"nytimes1\"/>\n\nEshleman revealed that Niko Nitai, the actor who played Peter, became a believer during the shooting. As for special effects, the film features puffs of smoke and transparent [[Halo (religious iconography)|halos]] to indicate miracles and angel figures, and a hissing snake and a deep voiceover represent Satan.<ref name=\"nytimes1\"/> Heyman's original cut of the ''Jesus'' film ran for more than four hours. However, in consultation with Bright and Eshleman, he edited a shorter version for Campus Crusade. Just after filming, Heyman was not satisfied with the native dialect of the [[Israeli people|Israeli]] cast members and decided that they all should be [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbed]] over by [[English people|English]] voice actors using the [[Received Pronunciation]] accent.{{sfn|Turner|2008|183}}\n\n==Release==\n''Jesus'' was released by [[Warner Bros.]] in the [[United States]] in over 2000 cinemas, which delineated a rare instance of a major studio releasing an \u201covertly religious picture.\u201d<ref name=\"AFI CATALOG OF FEATURE FILMS\"/> To promote the film, Paul Eshleman worked with both [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] and [[Catholic]] churches to arrange group trips and discounts. Four million viewers reportedly watch the ''Jesus'' film in late 1979 and 1980. However, though the film was popular with Christian audiences, it failed to attract mainstream audiences. It was not a financial success and left John Heyman's Genesis Project US$4 million in debt.{{sfn|Turner|2008|183-184}}\n\nThe release date varied between countries; In [[Australia]], it was released on April 3, 1980; in [[Portugal]] on April 9, 1981; in [[Sweden]] on November 1, 1985; in [[Finland]] on March 14, 1986; in [[Hungary]] on 13 December 1990; and in [[Czechoslovakia]] in 1991. Nonetheless, the film has been presented in 229 nations, being screened in dozens of large cities to the smallest villages in a lot of different countries.<ref name=\"nytimes1\"/>\n\nWarner Bros. received backlash for distributing the film simultaneously with ''[[Monty Python's Life of Brian]]'' (1979), a Warner Bros. release that was stigmatised by some religious leaders for its satirical characterisation of events surrounding Jesus Christ, although the studio considered the coinciding releases as \u201c\u2018something for everybody.\u2019\u201d Yet the producers of this film evaluated whether to take [[legal action]] against the studio for a conflict of interest.<ref name=\"AFI CATALOG OF FEATURE FILMS\"/>\n\nDespite the [[crucifixion of Jesus|crucifixion]] and [[Flagellation of Christ|flagellation]] scenes, the film was rated G by the [[MPAA]] and, likewise in Australia, it was rated G by the [[Australian Classification Board|ACB]].<ref>[http://www.classification.gov.au/Pages/View.aspx?sid=z4wGCPclUAizfV7jm7FavA%253d%253d&ncdctx=9vxqzCN0E0g2pGK%252fYZeqBPoKesvkQPIRy%252fR%252f9q4L6alIhwqf3pH0wEiPVY3KVDph JESUS (VIDEOTAPE)] by the ACB</ref> In the UK, however, the film was rated PG by the [[BBFC]].<ref>[https://bbfc.co.uk/releases/jesus-1979 JESUS (1979) \u2013 British Board of Film Classification]</ref>\n\n===Latter versions===\n[[File:Jesus.film.1979.jpg|thumb|170px|2004 DVD poster.]]\n;1999-2002\nTo make the film more relevant for younger viewers, new footage for ''The Story of Jesus for Children'' was filmed in 1999. Being less violent than the original, it was interwoven into an edited version of the original film ''Jesus'' and released in 2000. In 2001, a new opening sequence depicting the [[Creationism|creation of humans]], the expulsion from [[Garden of Eden|Eden]], [[Abraham]]'s blocked [[Human sacrifice|sacrifice]] of his son, and the prophesies of [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] was filmed to show, as Paul Eshleman states in the audio commentary, how Jesus' life fits into the span of history. In 2002, a special edition of ''Jesus'' commemorating the [[September 11 attacks]] was distributed in the [[VHS]] format. It contains introductions by [[New York City]] [[New York City Fire Department|firefighters]] and [[New York Police Department|police officers]] and has a running time of 83 minutes.\n\n;2003\nAn edited [[DVD]] version of ''Jesus'' was also packaged with ''JESUS: Fact or Fiction?'', which was produced in 2003 by Inspirational Films. This features a section called the \"Journey of Spiritual Discovery\". Biblical scholars, historians, philosophers, authors, and ministers answer specific questions relating to God, Jesus, Christianity, the archaeological, scientific and historical accuracy of the Bible, and testimony from many Christians. Viewers can browse the numerous topics individually or they can watch the film and, when prompted by a \"discovery glass\" icon, can access relevant comments. After they are finished, the viewer is returned to the scene they were watching.\n\nThe version was promoted to Muslims of [[Iraq]] during the hardships of the [[Iraqi War]], where its website featured a banner advert that said \"Send videocassettes of 'JESUS' to Iraq\".

Heyman also objected to Campus Crusade making multiple different versions of his film. When Campus Crusade produced a shorter version ''The Story of Jesus for Children'', which included new footage, Heyman sued Crusade on the grounds that the new version damaged his reputation. Though the dispute was settled by the parties out of court, relations between Heyman and Campus Crusade remained poor.{{sfn|Turner|2008|184}}\n\nRegarding the foreign reception, documentary maker Seghal said \"The events we witnessed were often bewildering,\" he says. \"But what struck us most was the utter normality of those who were willing to risk their lives for Christ.\"<ref name=\"BBC News\"/> After the film's reels were sent to remote settlements in Africa, Asia and Latin America, they returned with reports of audiences being in tears during screening with others instantly [[Religious conversion|converting]].

Based on the distribution rate by 2005, JVP did not expect to reach countrywide status until 2040 or later.<ref name=\"AFI CATALOG OF FEATURE FILMS\"/> As of August 2018, over 8 billion viewers were reported through in-person film showings, online platforms and apps.<ref>[https://www.jesusfilm.org/about/learn-more/statistics.html Jesusfilm.org]</ref>\n\n==Foreign-language versions==\nIn 1981, [[Bill Bright]] created the Jesus Film Project organization with the goal of accurately translating ''Jesus'' into other languages and showing them around the world. The first translation was done for the [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]]-speaking people of the [[Philippines]].  One of the group's first projects, they ordered for the broadcast of a Hindi version in [[Indian television]]. The organization works with thousands of missionaries around the world to show the film, sometimes to audiences who have never seen a motion picture. The [[Mandarin Chinese]] version of the film is widely distributed in China by the government-linked [[China Christian Council]]'s [[Amity Foundation]] in [[Nanjing]], both on [[VCD]]s and [[DVD]].<ref name=\"AFI CATALOG OF FEATURE FILMS\"/>\n\nDistribution in the United States has included direct mail campaigns sponsored by churches to deliver a copy of the film to every address in select [[ZIP code]]s across the country, with more than 4.8 million copies sent to Ohio and Texas alone. In 2004, the organization made the film available for viewing on its website in over 300 languages. Both ''Jesus'' and ''The Story of Jesus for Children'' are available in [[DVD]] and [[VHS]] formats. Audio dramatizations in a number of languages are also available. It is the only film that has been dubbed into more than 1000 languages of the world. As of now, more than 1600 languages spoken all over the world have the ''Jesus'' film, including in all major international languages.<ref name=\"AFI CATALOG OF FEATURE FILMS\"/> Also in 2004, 300 employees at an office in [[Orlando, Fl]] translated the film into languages such as [[Kwanyama]], spoken in [[Angola]] and [[Namibia]], and as well as the seven [[variety (linguistics)|varieties]] of [[Quechuan languages|Quechua]], a tongue of [[Quechua people]] in the [[Andes]].<ref name=\"NYT Jesus film 2\"/>\n\nRegarding its worldwide spread and translations, Eshleman states, \"People ask 'Why do you go to those far away places?' It's because those people haven't had a chance. That's all we want to do - to give them a chance to hear the [[Christian mission|message of Christ]] in an understandable language near where they live.\" John Meyer, one of the team members who has helped distributing and translating the film, has said, \"I'm willing to lay down my life for Jesus, should it come to that,\" he told the documentary maker Sehgal. \"So if there's a recording in a war-torn country, I'm more than willing to go. Or anywhere else, to be honest.\"<ref name=\"BBC News\"/>\n\nIncidentally, American [[aid worker]]s in [[Afghanistan]], who hadn't been working for the Jesus film project, were arrested by the [[Taliban]] in 2001 for showing the film to a family there. They were ultimately rescued by [[US Marines]], and president [[George W. Bush]] welcomed them back to America, saying: \"It's been an uplifting experience to talk to these courageous souls\".<ref name=\"BBC News\"/>\n\n==See also==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Depiction of Jesus]]\n* [[King of Kings (1961 film)|''King of Kings'' (1961 film)]]\n* [[Jesus of Nazareth (miniseries)|''Jesus of Nazareth'' (miniseries)]]\n* [[The Gospel of John (film)|''The Gospel of John'' (film)]]\n* ''[[The Greatest Story Ever Told]]''\n* ''[[The Passion of the Christ]]''\n* [[Jesus (1999 film)|''Jesus'' (1999 film)]]\n* [[Son of God (film)|''Son of God'' (film)]]\n* ''[[The Visual Bible: Matthew]]''\n* ''[[Magdalena: Released from Shame]]''\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book |last1=Stanley |first1=Jeffrey L. |last2=Walsh |first2=Richard |title=Jesus, the Gospels, and Cinematic Imagination: A Handbook to Jesus on DVD |date=October 11, 2007 |publisher=Westminster John Knox Press |location=[[Louisville, Kentucky]] |isbn=9780664230319}}\n* {{cite book|last=Turner|first=John G.|title=Bill Bright and Campus Crusade for Christ : the renewal of evangelicalism in postwar America|year=2008|publisher=The University of North Carolina Press|location=Chapel Hill, NC|isbn=978-0-8078-3185-4|p=181\u2013187}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.jesusfilm.org/ Jesus Film Project]\n* [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0079368/ ''Jesus''] at the [[Internet Movie Database]]\n* {{AFI film|56823}}\n* {{tcmdb title|79744|Jesus}}\n\n{{Peter Sykes}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Jesus (1979 Film)}}\n[[Category:1979 films]]\n[[Category:1970s drama films]]\n[[Category:1970s biographical films]]\n[[Category:Biographical films about Jesus]]\n[[Category:Christian missions]]\n[[Category:Gospel of Luke]]\n[[Category:English-language films]]\n[[Category:Portrayals of the Virgin Mary in film]]\n[[Category:Films about Evangelicalism]]\n[[Category:Film portrayals of Jesus' death and resurrection]]\n[[Category:Films directed by John Krish]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Peter Sykes]]\n[[Category:Foreign films shot in Israel]]\n[[Category:American films]]\n[[Category:American drama films]]\n[[Category:American biographical films]]\n[[Category:American epic films]]\n[[Category:Cultural depictions of Judas Iscariot]]\n[[Category:Religious epic films]]\n[[Category:Depictions of Herod the Great on film]]\n[[Category:Cultural depictions of John the Baptist]]\n[[Category:Cultural depictions of Pontius Pilate]]\n", "name_user": "7quiver", "label": "safe", "comment": "Correct Ref info", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus_(1979_film)"}

''[https://www.theguardian.com/science/2008/may/31/maths.science The science of fun]'' The Guardian, 30 May 2008</ref>\n\n==Major areas of research==\n\n===Combinatorial game theory===\nConway is widely known for his contributions to [[combinatorial game theory]] (CGT), a theory of [[partisan game]]s. This he developed with [[Elwyn Berlekamp]] and [[Richard K. Guy|Richard Guy]], and with them also co-authored the book ''[[Winning Ways for your Mathematical Plays]]''. He also wrote the book ''[[On Numbers and Games]]'' (''ONAG'') which lays out the mathematical foundations of CGT.\n\nHe is also one of the inventors of [[Sprouts (game)|sprouts]], as well as [[phutball|philosopher's football]]. He developed detailed analyses of many other games and puzzles, such as the [[Soma cube]], [[peg solitaire]], and [[Conway's soldiers]]. He came up with the [[angel problem]], which was solved in 2006.\n\nHe invented a new system of numbers, the [[surreal numbers]], which are closely related to certain games and have been the subject of a mathematical novelette by [[Donald Knuth]].<ref>[http://discovermagazine.com/1995/dec/infinityplusonea599 Infinity Plus One, and Other Surreal Numbers] by Polly Shulman, [[Discover Magazine]], 1 December 1995</ref> He also invented a nomenclature for exceedingly [[large number]]s, the [[Conway chained arrow notation]]. Much of this is discussed in the 0th part of ''ONAG''.\n\n===Geometry===\nIn the mid-1960s with [[Michael Guy (computer scientist)|Michael Guy]], Conway established that there are sixty-four [[uniform polychoron|convex uniform polychora]] excluding two infinite sets of prismatic forms. They discovered the [[grand antiprism]] in the process, the only [[non-Wythoffian]] uniform [[polychoron]]. Conway has also suggested a system of notation dedicated to describing [[polyhedra]] called [[Conway polyhedron notation]].\n\nIn the theory of tessellations, he devised the [[Conway criterion]] which describes rules for deciding if a prototile will tile the plane.<ref name=rhoads>{{cite journal| doi=10.1016/j.cam.2004.05.002 | volume=174 | issue=2 | title=Planar tilings by polyominoes, polyhexes, and polyiamonds | year=2005 | journal=Journal of Computational and Applied Mathematics | pages=329\u2013353 | last1 = Rhoads | first1 = Glenn C.| bibcode=2005JCoAM.174..329R }}</ref>\n\nHe investigated lattices in higher dimensions, and was the first to determine the symmetry group of the [[Leech lattice]].\n\n===Geometric topology===\nIn knot theory, Conway formulated a new variation of the [[Alexander polynomial]] and produced a new invariant now called the Conway polynomial.<ref>[http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ConwayPolynomial.html Conway Polynomial] [[Wolfram MathWorld]]</ref> After lying dormant for more than a decade, this concept became central to work in the 1980s on the novel [[knot polynomial]]s.<ref>Livingston, Charles, Knot Theory (MAA Textbooks), 1993, {{ISBN|0883850273}}</ref> Conway further developed [[tangle theory]] and invented a system of notation for tabulating knots, nowadays known as [[Conway notation (knot theory)|Conway notation]], while correcting a number of errors in the 19th century knot tables and extending them to include all but four of the non-alternating primes with 11 crossings. See Topology Proceedings 7 (1982) 118.\n\n===Group theory===\nHe was the primary author of the ''[[ATLAS of Finite Groups]]'' giving properties of many [[finite simple group]]s. Working with his colleagues Robert Curtis and [[Simon P. Norton]] he constructed the first concrete representations of some of the [[sporadic group]]s. More specifically, he discovered three sporadic groups based on the symmetry of the [[Leech lattice]], which have been designated the [[Conway groups]].<ref name=harris>Harris (2015)</ref> This work made him a key player in the successful [[classification of the finite simple groups]].\n\nBased on a 1978 observation by mathematician [[John McKay (mathematician)|John McKay]], Conway and Norton formulated the complex of conjectures known as [[monstrous moonshine]]. This subject, named by Conway, relates the [[monster group]] with [[elliptic modular function]]s, thus bridging two previously distinct areas of mathematics\u2013[[finite group]]s and [[complex function theory]]. Monstrous moonshine theory has now been revealed to also have deep connections to [[string theory]].<ref>[http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/M/Monstrous_Moonshine_conjecture.html Monstrous Moonshine conjecture] David Darling: Encyclopedia of Science</ref>\n\nConway introduced the [[Mathieu groupoid]], an extension of the [[Mathieu group M12|Mathieu group M<sub>12</sub>]] to 13 points.\n\n===Number theory===\nAs a graduate student, he proved one case of a [[Waring's problem|conjecture]] by [[Edward Waring]], that in which every integer could be written as the sum of 37 numbers, each raised to the fifth power, though [[Chen Jingrun]] solved the problem independently before Conway's work could be published.<ref>[http://www.ems-ph.org/journals/newsletter/pdf/2005-09-57.pdf#page=34 Breakfast with John Horton Conway]</ref>\n\n===Algebra===\nConway has written textbooks and done original work in algebra, focusing particularly on [[quaternion]]s and [[octonion]]s.<ref>Conway and Smith (2003): \"Conway and Smith's book is a wonderful introduction to the normed division algebras: the real numbers, the complex numbers, the quaternions, and the octonions.\"</ref>  Together with [[Neil Sloane]], he invented the [[icosians]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/week20.html| title=This Week's Finds in Mathematical Physics (Week 20)| author=John Baez| date=2 October 1993}}</ref>\n\n===Analysis===\nHe invented a [[Conway base 13 function|base 13 function]] as a counterexample to the [[converse (logic)|converse]] of the [[intermediate value theorem]]: the function takes on every real value in each interval on the real line, so it has a [[Darboux property]] but is ''not'' [[continuous function|continuous]].\n\n===Algorithmics===\nFor calculating the day of the week, he invented the [[Doomsday algorithm]]. The algorithm is simple enough for anyone with basic arithmetic ability to do the calculations mentally. Conway can usually give the correct answer in under two seconds. To improve his speed, he practices his calendrical calculations on his computer, which is programmed to quiz him with random dates every time he logs on. One of his early books was on [[finite-state machine]]s.\n\n===Theoretical physics===\nIn 2004, Conway and [[Simon B. Kochen]], another Princeton mathematician, proved the [[free will theorem]], a startling version of the \"[[Hidden-variable theory|no hidden variables]]\" principle of [[quantum mechanics]]. It states that given certain conditions, if an experimenter can freely decide what quantities to measure in a particular experiment, then elementary particles must be free to choose their spins to make the measurements consistent with physical law. In Conway's provocative wording: \"if experimenters have [[free will]], then so do elementary particles.\"<ref>''[http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~jas/one/freewill-theorem.html Conway's Proof Of The Free Will Theorem] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100516002546/http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~jas/one/freewill-theorem.html |date=16 May 2010 }}'' by Jasvir Nagra</ref>\n\n==Awards and honours==\nConway received the [[Berwick Prizes|Berwick Prize]] (1971),<ref name=\"LMS Prizewinners\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.lms.ac.uk/prizes/list-lms-prize-winners|title=List of LMS prize winners &#124; London Mathematical Society|website=www.lms.ac.uk}}</ref> was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] (1981),<ref name=royal/> was the first recipient of the [[P\u00f3lya Prize (LMS)]] (1987),<ref name=\"LMS Prizewinners\"/> won the [[Nemmers Prize in Mathematics]] (1998) and received the [[Leroy P.

''[https://www.theguardian.com/science/2008/may/31/maths.science The science of fun]'' The Guardian, 30 May 2008</ref>\n\n==Major areas of research==\n\n===Combinatorial game theory===\nConway is widely known for his contributions to [[combinatorial game theory]] (CGT), a theory of [[partisan game]]s. This he developed with [[Elwyn Berlekamp]] and [[Richard K. Guy|Richard Guy]], and with them also co-authored the book ''[[Winning Ways for your Mathematical Plays]]''. He also wrote the book ''[[On Numbers and Games]]'' (''ONAG'') which lays out the mathematical foundations of CGT.\n\nHe is also one of the inventors of [[Sprouts (game)|sprouts]], as well as [[phutball|philosopher's football]]. He developed detailed analyses of many other games and puzzles, such as the [[Soma cube]], [[peg solitaire]], and [[Conway's soldiers]]. He came up with the [[angel problem]], which was solved in 2006.\n\nHe invented a new system of numbers, the [[surreal numbers]], which are closely related to certain games and have been the subject of a mathematical novelette by [[Donald Knuth]].<ref>[http://discovermagazine.com/1995/dec/infinityplusonea599 Infinity Plus One, and Other Surreal Numbers] by Polly Shulman, [[Discover Magazine]], 1 December 1995</ref> He also invented a nomenclature for exceedingly [[large number]]s, the [[Conway chained arrow notation]]. Much of this is discussed in the 0th part of ''ONAG''.\n\n===Geometry===\nIn the mid-1960s with [[Michael Guy (computer scientist)|Michael Guy]], Conway established that there are sixty-four [[uniform polychoron|convex uniform polychora]] excluding two infinite sets of prismatic forms. They discovered the [[grand antiprism]] in the process, the only [[non-Wythoffian]] uniform [[polychoron]]. Conway has also suggested a system of notation dedicated to describing [[polyhedra]] called [[Conway polyhedron notation]].\n\nIn the theory of tessellations, he devised the [[Conway criterion]] which describes rules for deciding if a prototile will tile the plane.<ref name=rhoads>{{cite journal| doi=10.1016/j.cam.2004.05.002 | volume=174 | issue=2 | title=Planar tilings by polyominoes, polyhexes, and polyiamonds | year=2005 | journal=Journal of Computational and Applied Mathematics | pages=329\u2013353 | last1 = Rhoads | first1 = Glenn C.| bibcode=2005JCoAM.174..329R }}</ref>\n\nHe investigated lattices in higher dimensions, and was the first to determine the symmetry group of the [[Leech lattice]].\n\n===Geometric topology===\nIn knot theory, Conway formulated a new variation of the [[Alexander polynomial]] and produced a new invariant now called the Conway polynomial.<ref>[http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ConwayPolynomial.html Conway Polynomial] [[Wolfram MathWorld]]</ref> After lying dormant for more than a decade, this concept became central to work in the 1980s on the novel [[knot polynomial]]s.<ref>Livingston, Charles, Knot Theory (MAA Textbooks), 1993, {{ISBN|0883850273}}</ref> Conway further developed [[tangle theory]] and invented a system of notation for tabulating knots, nowadays known as [[Conway notation (knot theory)|Conway notation]], while correcting a number of errors in the 19th century knot tables and extending them to include all but four of the non-alternating primes with 11 crossings. See Topology Proceedings 7 (1982) 118.\n\n===Group theory===\nHe was the primary author of the ''[[ATLAS of Finite Groups]]'' giving properties of many [[finite simple group]]s. Working with his colleagues Robert Curtis and [[Simon P. Norton]] he constructed the first concrete representations of some of the [[sporadic group]]s. More specifically, he discovered three sporadic groups based on the symmetry of the [[Leech lattice]], which have been designated the [[Conway groups]].<ref name=harris>Harris (2015)</ref> This work made him a key player in the successful [[classification of the finite simple groups]].\n\nBased on a 1978 observation by mathematician [[John McKay (mathematician)|John McKay]], Conway and Norton formulated the complex of conjectures known as [[monstrous moonshine]]. This subject, named by Conway, relates the [[monster group]] with [[elliptic modular function]]s, thus bridging two previously distinct areas of mathematics\u2013[[finite group]]s and [[complex function theory]]. Monstrous moonshine theory has now been revealed to also have deep connections to [[string theory]].<ref>[http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/M/Monstrous_Moonshine_conjecture.html Monstrous Moonshine conjecture] David Darling: Encyclopedia of Science</ref>\n\nConway introduced the [[Mathieu groupoid]], an extension of the [[Mathieu group M12|Mathieu group M<sub>12</sub>]] to 13 points.\n\n===Number theory===\nAs a graduate student, he proved one case of a [[Waring's problem|conjecture]] by [[Edward Waring]], that in which every integer could be written as the sum of 37 numbers, each raised to the fifth power, though [[Chen Jingrun]] solved the problem independently before Conway's work could be published.<ref>[http://www.ems-ph.org/journals/newsletter/pdf/2005-09-57.pdf#page=34 Breakfast with John Horton Conway]</ref>\n\n===Algebra===\nConway has written textbooks and done original work in algebra, focusing particularly on [[quaternion]]s and [[octonion]]s.<ref>Conway and Smith (2003): \"Conway and Smith's book is a wonderful introduction to the normed division algebras: the real numbers, the complex numbers, the quaternions, and the octonions.\"</ref>  Together with [[Neil Sloane]], he invented the [[icosians]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/week20.html| title=This Week's Finds in Mathematical Physics (Week 20)| author=John Baez| date=2 October 1993}}</ref>\n\n===Analysis===\nHe invented a [[Conway base 13 function|base 13 function]] as a counterexample to the [[converse (logic)|converse]] of the [[intermediate value theorem]]: the function takes on every real value in each interval on the real line, so it has a [[Darboux property]] but is ''not'' [[continuous function|continuous]].\n\n===Algorithmics===\nFor calculating the day of the week, he invented the [[Doomsday algorithm]]. The algorithm is simple enough for anyone with basic arithmetic ability to do the calculations mentally. Conway can usually give the correct answer in under two seconds. To improve his speed, he practices his calendrical calculations on his computer, which is programmed to quiz him with random dates every time he logs on. One of his early books was on [[finite-state machine]]s.\n\n===Theoretical physics===\nIn 2004, Conway and [[Simon B. Kochen]], another Princeton mathematician, proved the [[free will theorem]], a startling version of the \"[[Hidden-variable theory|no hidden variables]]\" principle of [[quantum mechanics]]. It states that given certain conditions, if an experimenter can freely decide what quantities to measure in a particular experiment, then elementary particles must be free to choose their spins to make the measurements consistent with physical law. In Conway's provocative wording: \"if experimenters have [[free will]], then so do elementary particles.\"<ref>''[http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~jas/one/freewill-theorem.html Conway's Proof Of The Free Will Theorem] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100516002546/http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~jas/one/freewill-theorem.html |date=16 May 2010 }}'' by Jasvir Nagra</ref>\n\n==Awards and honours==\nConway received the [[Berwick Prizes|Berwick Prize]] (1971),<ref name=\"LMS Prizewinners\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.lms.ac.uk/prizes/list-lms-prize-winners|title=List of LMS prize winners &#124; London Mathematical Society|website=www.lms.ac.uk}}</ref> was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] (1981),<ref name=royal/> was the first recipient of the [[P\u00f3lya Prize (LMS)]] (1987),<ref name=\"LMS Prizewinners\"/> won the [[Nemmers Prize in Mathematics]] (1998) and received the [[Leroy P.
