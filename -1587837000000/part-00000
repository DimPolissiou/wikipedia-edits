Starting as an independent underground filmmaker, Schlingensief later staged productions for theatres and festivals, often accompanied by public controversies. In the final years before his death, he staged [[Parsifal]] at the [[Bayreuth Festival]] and worked at several [[opera]] houses, establishing himself as a ''[[Regietheater]]'' artist. He posthumously won the Golden Lion for Germany in 2011 at the Venice Biennale for the best national pavilion, which was turned into an installative replica of the stage design for his autobiographical play ''A Church of Fear VS. the Alien Within'', alluding to his cancer illness.\n\n==Early life and education==\nSchlingensief was born on 24 October 1960 in [[Oberhausen]]. His father was a [[pharmacist]] and his mother a [[pediatric]] nurse. As a child, he worked as an [[altar server]] and already made short films with a hand-held camera.\n\nHaving passed his ''[[Abitur]]'' exams, he twice failed to gain admission to the [[University of Television and Film Munich]]. From 1981 he studied [[German studies|German language and literature]], philosophy and art history at [[Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen]], but also dabbled as a musician and finally dropped out in 1983 to work as an assistant to the [[experimental film]]maker [[Werner Nekes]].<ref name=\"Grimes\">William Grimes (August 25, 2010), [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/25/arts/25schlingensief.html Christoph Schlingensief, Artistic Provocateur, Dies at 49] ''[[The New York Times]]''.</ref> After working as a teacher at [[Hochschule f\u00fcr Gestaltung Offenbach am Main]] and [[Kunstakademie D\u00fcsseldorf]], he became a production manager on [[Hans W.

He considered himself a 'provocatively thoughtful' artist. He created numerous controversial and provocative theatre pieces as well as films, his former mentor being filmmaker and media artist Werner Nekes.\n\n=== Film ===\n[[File:Part of the jury o.jpg|thumb|Schlingensief at the 2009 Berlinale reception, with his partner [[:de:Aino Laberenz|Aino Laberenz]] (right), [[Alice Waters]] and [[Gaston Kabor\u00e9]]]]\nAlready Schlingensief's debut feature film, the surreal, absurd experimental ''Tunguska \u2013 Die Kisten sind da!'' (\"Tunguska \u2013 The Crates Are Delivered!\", 1984) was well received by critics. Growing up in the shadow of the [[New German Cinema]], Schlingensief was deeply influenced by the likes of [[Rainer Werner Fassbinder]]\u2014many members of whose stock company of actors such as [[Udo Kier]], [[Margit Carstensen]], [[Irm Hermann]] or [[Volker Spengler]] became regulars in Schlingensief's films\u2014or [[Alexander Kluge]], with whom he collaborated on numerous occasions. To said period of film, Schlingensief delivered both a heartfelt homage as well as the final coup de gr\u00e2ce with ''The 120 Days of Bottrop''\u2014starring [[Helmut Berger]], playing an inept director's effort to remake [[Pier Paolo Pasolini]]'s ''[[Sal\u00f2, or the 120 Days of Sodom]]'' (1975)<ref name=\"Former Auteur in Love With Outrage\">Ken Johnson (May 1, 2014), [https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/02/arts/design/former-auteur-in-love-with-outrage.html Former Auteur in Love With Outrage] ''[[The New York Times]]''.</ref>\u2014in much the same way he dealt with German avant-garde cinema 15 years earlier with his first feature film ''Tunguska \u2013 The Crates Are Delivered'' starring {{Interlanguage link multi|Alfred Edel (actor)|de|3=Alfred Edel|lt=Alfred Edel}}. Drawing parallels to the work of British filmmaker [[Derek Jarman]], ''Egomania \u2013 Island without Hope'' (1986) starred Kier and [[Tilda Swinton]]. Other influences include [[Luis Bu\u00f1uel]], [[Werner Schroeter]] or [[Herbert Achternbusch]]\u2014and Schlingensief's filmic works have been compared to just as wide a range of filmmakers, from [[Jean-Luc Godard]] to [[Russ Meyer]].\n\nWith his \"Germany Trilogy\", consisting of ''100 Years of Adolf Hitler \u2013 The Last Hour in the F\u00fchrerbunker'', ''[[The German Chainsaw Massacre]] \u2013 The First Hour of the Reunification'' and ''Terror 2000 \u2013 Germany out of Control'', Schlingensief came to prominence. Since then he shaped the cultural and political discourse in Germany for more than two decades and established himself as one of the country's most important and versatile artists. The \"Germany Trilogy\" deals with three turning points in 20th-century German history: the first movie ''Hundert Jahre Adolf Hitler'' (\"A Hundred Years of Adolf Hitler\", 1989) covers the last hours of [[Adolf Hitler]], the second ''The German Chainsaw Massacre'' (1990), depicts the German reunification of 1990 and shows a group of East Germans who cross the border to visit West Germany and get slaughtered by a psychopathic West German family with chainsaws, and the third ''Terror 2000'' (1992) focuses on xenophobic violence after the reunification process.\n\nOne of Schlingensief's central tactics was to call politicians' bluff in an attempt to reveal the inanities of their \"responsible\" discourse, a tactic he called \"playing something through to its end\". This strategy was most notable in his work ''Please Love Austria'' (alternately named ''[[Foreigners out! Schlingensiefs Container]]'') at the time of the [[FP\u00d6]] and [[\u00d6VP]] coalition in Austria, a work which attracted international support, a media frenzy and countless debates about art practice.\n\nIn 2009, he joined the jury of the [[Berlin International Film Festival]] under [[Tilda Swinton]].\n\n===Television===\nSchlingensief soon became a figure of considerable celebrity and notoriety in Germany, thanks to several popular television projects. Broadcast in 1997, ''Talk 2000'' was a talk show with celebrity guests in which Schlingensief sometimes interrupted interviews to discuss his own personal problems.<ref name=\"Former Auteur in Love With Outrage\"/> In ''U3000'' (2000), he and his crew were filmed acting crazily on platforms and in cars of the Berlin subway system; the program aired on [[MTV Germany]]. In ''Freakstars 3000'' (2003), a six-part ''[[American Idol]]''-style parody, two dozen people from an assisted-living home for the mentally disabled competed for spots in a new band.<ref name=\"Former Auteur in Love With Outrage\"/>\n\n=== Art ===\nIn 1997, Schlingesief staged an art action at the [[documenta]] X exhibition in Kassel as part of the performance space \"Hybrid WorkSpace,\" which was curated by [[Klaus Biesenbach]], [[Nancy Spector]] and [[Hans-Ulrich Obrist]]. During the performance, Schlingensief was arrested for carrying a placard with the words \"Kill [[Helmut Kohl]]!\".<ref name=\"Rorrison\"/> In November 1999, invited by P.S.1 Contemporary Art Center and organized by Klaus Biesenbach, Schlingensief carried out a performance at the Statue of Liberty in New York City, where, kneeling down at the foot of the statue, he handed Germany over to globalization.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://press.moma.org/wp-content/files_mf/schlingensief_walltexts.pdf|title=Searching for Germany \u201899|website=press.moma.org|access-date=26 September 2017}}</ref>\n\nHis exhibition \"The Last Hour\", with its twisted metalwork from a crashed car, footage of a long tunnel and paparazzi pictures of [[Princess Diana]], was in 2006 rejected by the [[Frieze Art Fair]] in London's Regent's Park and instead ended up in a little-known gallery space in [[Bethnal Green]].<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/culture-obituaries/film-obituaries/8100536/Christoph-Schlingensief.html Christoph Schlingensief obituary] ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', October 31, 2010.</ref> He later joined the [[Hauser & Wirth]] gallery. In 2007, the [[Haus der Kunst]], Munich, mounted an exhibition of Schlingensief's work; it presented ''African Twin Towers'' and short films that have been shot while the artist directed ''[[The Flying Dutchman (opera)|The Flying Dutchman]]'' at the [[Teatro Amazonas]] in Manaus, Brazil.<ref>[http://www.hausderkunst.de/index.php?id=667&tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=82&L=1 Christoph Schlingensief, \"18 Images a Second\", May 25 \u2013 September 16, 2007] Haus der Kunst, Munich.</ref>\n\n=== Theatre ===\n[[File:Deutschlandsuche99.jpg|thumb|Schlingensief speaking at the ''Deutschlandsuche 99'' performance in front of the Volksb\u00fchne, 1999]]\nIn the 1990s, Schlingensief directed a series of chaotic, satirical productions at the [[Volksb\u00fchne]] theatre in Berlin. He also directed a version of ''[[Hamlet]]'', subtitled, ''This is your Family, Nazi~Line'', which premiered in Switzerland, the so-called neutral territory equated with the Denmark of the opening line in [[Shakespeare]]'s play where there is something foul afoot. Events around the piece questioned and attacked Switzerland's 'neutrality' in the face of growing racism and extreme right wing movements. The artist duo [[Ubermorgen]] provided the Internet platform ''Nazi~Line''<ref>[http://www.naziline.de] Nazi~Line</ref> for the project, where former members of Neo Nazi groups were sought and then cast as actors to play characters in the drama on stage as a way of re-integrating the ex-Neo-Nazis with the common workforce of the theatre.\n\nSchlingensief's work covered a variety of media, including installation and the ubiquitous 'talk show' and has in many cases led to audience members leaving the theatre space with Schlingensief and his colleagues to take part in events such as ''Passion Impossible, Wake Up Call for Germany'' 1997 or ''Chance 2000, Vote for Yourself'' in which he formed the ''Last Chance Party'' where anyone could become a candidate themselves in the run up to the [[1998 German federal election|federal election of 1998 in Germany]].<ref name=\"Former Auteur in Love With Outrage\"/> The same year he made a performance project for an Austrian Festival for new art [[Steirischer Herbst]] called ''Chance 2000 for Graz'': eight pillars were built at the central [[Marienplatz]] square, where homeless people were invited to sit on, and the deal was that the one who sat there longest could win 7,000 shillings, plus every day the artist threw 20,000 shillings on passers-by in front of the eyes of those who sat on the pillars.<ref>[http://offsite.kulturserver-graz.at/projekte/657.html Christoph Schlingensief  Chance 2000 f\u00fcr Graz] ''[[OFFSITE GRAZ]]''.</ref> The project was interrupted with help of the right-wing [[Freedom Party of Austria]], that collected 10,000 signatures against it.\n\nWith his demands for people to \"prove they exist\" in an age of total TV coverage and \"act, act, act\" in the sense of becoming active not 'actors', his work could be considered a direct legacy of [[Bertolt Brecht]], as it demands involvement as opposed to passivity and merely looking on as is the case in traditional text-based theatre. In an age of extreme media fatigue, his was a fresh voice albeit and undisputedly containing echoes of the past, often humorous and subversive yet never cynical. His influences included [[Joseph Beuys]] and his idea of [[social sculpture]], and artists [[Allan Kaprow]] and [[Dieter Roth]]. At the time of his death, he was involved in productions for the [[Ruhrtriennale]]<ref name=\"Apthorp\">Shirley Apthorp (August 23, 2010), [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-08-22/schlingensief-director-who-put-rotten-bunny-on-bayreuth-stage-dies-at-49.html Schlingensief, Who Put Putrid Bunny on Bayreuth Stage, Is Dead] ''[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]]''.</ref> and for the [[Berlin Staatsoper]]'s \"Metanoia\".<ref>George Loomis (October 12, 2010), [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/13/arts/13iht-loomis13.html The New Opera 'Metanoia' Goes On, but Without Its Provocateur] ''[[The New York Times]]''.</ref>\n\n=== Opera ===\nIn 2004, at the invitation of [[Wolfgang Wagner|Wolfgang]] and [[Katharina Wagner]] and to rave reviews,<ref>Jeremy Eichler (July 27, 2004), [https://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/27/arts/critic-s-notebook-a-hullabaloo-for-an-opening-at-bayreuth.html A Hullabaloo For an Opening At Bayreuth] ''[[The New York Times]]''.</ref> he staged [[Richard Wagner]]'s ''[[Parsifal]]'' for the [[Bayreuth Festival]].

Starting as an independent underground filmmaker, Schlingensief later staged productions for theatres and festivals, often accompanied by public controversies. In the final years before his death, he staged [[Parsifal]] at the [[Bayreuth Festival]] and worked at several [[opera]] houses, establishing himself as a ''[[Regietheater]]'' artist. He posthumously won the Golden Lion for Germany in 2011 at the Venice Biennale for the best national pavilion, which was turned into an installative replica of the stage design for his autobiographical play ''A Church of Fear VS. the Alien Within'', alluding to his cancer illness.\n\n==Early life and education==\nSchlingensief was born on 24 October 1960 in [[Oberhausen]]. His father was a [[pharmacist]] and his mother a [[pediatric]] nurse. As a child, he worked as an [[altar server]] and already made short films with a hand-held camera.\n\nHaving passed his ''[[Abitur]]'' exams, he twice failed to gain admission to the [[University of Television and Film Munich]]. From 1981 he studied [[German studies|German language and literature]], philosophy and art history at [[Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen]], but also dabbled as a musician and finally dropped out in 1983 to work as an assistant to the [[experimental film]]maker [[Werner Nekes]].<ref name=\"Grimes\">William Grimes (August 25, 2010), [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/25/arts/25schlingensief.html Christoph Schlingensief, Artistic Provocateur, Dies at 49] ''[[The New York Times]]''.</ref> After working as a teacher at [[Hochschule f\u00fcr Gestaltung Offenbach am Main]] and [[Kunstakademie D\u00fcsseldorf]], he became a production manager on [[Hans W.

He considered himself a 'provocatively thoughtful' artist. He created numerous controversial and provocative theatre pieces as well as films, his former mentor being filmmaker and media artist Werner Nekes.\n\n=== Film ===\n[[File:Part of the jury o.jpg|thumb|Schlingensief at the 2009 Berlinale reception, with his partner [[:de:Aino Laberenz|Aino Laberenz]] (right), [[Alice Waters]] and [[Gaston Kabor\u00e9]]]]\nAlready Schlingensief's debut feature film, the surreal, absurd experimental ''Tunguska \u2013 Die Kisten sind da!'' (\"Tunguska \u2013 The Crates Are Delivered!\", 1984) was well received by critics. Growing up in the shadow of the [[New German Cinema]], Schlingensief was deeply influenced by the likes of [[Rainer Werner Fassbinder]]\u2014many members of whose stock company of actors such as [[Udo Kier]], [[Margit Carstensen]], [[Irm Hermann]] or [[Volker Spengler]] became regulars in Schlingensief's films\u2014or [[Alexander Kluge]], with whom he collaborated on numerous occasions. To said period of film, Schlingensief delivered both a heartfelt homage as well as the final coup de gr\u00e2ce with ''The 120 Days of Bottrop''\u2014starring [[Helmut Berger]], playing an inept director's effort to remake [[Pier Paolo Pasolini]]'s ''[[Sal\u00f2, or the 120 Days of Sodom]]'' (1975)<ref name=\"Former Auteur in Love With Outrage\">Ken Johnson (May 1, 2014), [https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/02/arts/design/former-auteur-in-love-with-outrage.html Former Auteur in Love With Outrage] ''[[The New York Times]]''.</ref>\u2014in much the same way he dealt with German avant-garde cinema 15 years earlier with his first feature film ''Tunguska \u2013 The Crates Are Delivered'' starring {{Interlanguage link multi|Alfred Edel (actor)|de|3=Alfred Edel|lt=Alfred Edel}}. Drawing parallels to the work of British filmmaker [[Derek Jarman]], ''Egomania \u2013 Island without Hope'' (1986) starred Kier and [[Tilda Swinton]]. Other influences include [[Luis Bu\u00f1uel]], [[Werner Schroeter]] or [[Herbert Achternbusch]]\u2014and Schlingensief's filmic works have been compared to just as wide a range of filmmakers, from [[Jean-Luc Godard]] to [[Russ Meyer]].\n\nWith his \"Germany Trilogy\", consisting of ''100 Years of Adolf Hitler \u2013 The Last Hour in the F\u00fchrerbunker'', ''[[The German Chainsaw Massacre]] \u2013 The First Hour of the Reunification'' and ''Terror 2000 \u2013 Germany out of Control'', Schlingensief came to prominence. Since then he shaped the cultural and political discourse in Germany for more than two decades and established himself as one of the country's most important and versatile artists. The \"Germany Trilogy\" deals with three turning points in 20th-century German history: the first movie ''Hundert Jahre Adolf Hitler'' (\"A Hundred Years of Adolf Hitler\", 1989) covers the last hours of [[Adolf Hitler]], the second ''The German Chainsaw Massacre'' (1990), depicts the German reunification of 1990 and shows a group of East Germans who cross the border to visit West Germany and get slaughtered by a psychopathic West German family with chainsaws, and the third ''Terror 2000'' (1992) focuses on xenophobic violence after the reunification process.\n\nOne of Schlingensief's central tactics was to call politicians' bluff in an attempt to reveal the inanities of their \"responsible\" discourse, a tactic he called \"playing something through to its end\". This strategy was most notable in his work ''Please Love Austria'' (alternately named ''[[Foreigners out! Schlingensiefs Container]]'') at the time of the [[FP\u00d6]] and [[\u00d6VP]] coalition in Austria, a work which attracted international support, a media frenzy and countless debates about art practice.\n\nIn 2009, he joined the jury of the [[Berlin International Film Festival]] under [[Tilda Swinton]].\n\n===Television===\nSchlingensief soon became a figure of considerable celebrity and notoriety in Germany, thanks to several popular television projects. Broadcast in 1997, ''Talk 2000'' was a talk show with celebrity guests in which Schlingensief sometimes interrupted interviews to discuss his own personal problems.<ref name=\"Former Auteur in Love With Outrage\"/> In ''U3000'' (2000), he and his crew were filmed acting crazily on platforms and in cars of the Berlin subway system; the program aired on [[MTV Germany]]. In ''Freakstars 3000'' (2003), a six-part ''[[American Idol]]''-style parody, two dozen people from an assisted-living home for the mentally disabled competed for spots in a new band.<ref name=\"Former Auteur in Love With Outrage\"/>\n\n=== Art ===\nIn 1997, Schlingesief staged an art action at the [[documenta]] X exhibition in Kassel as part of the performance space \"Hybrid WorkSpace,\" which was curated by [[Klaus Biesenbach]], [[Nancy Spector]] and [[Hans-Ulrich Obrist]]. During the performance, Schlingensief was arrested for carrying a placard with the words \"Kill [[Helmut Kohl]]!\".<ref name=\"Rorrison\"/> In November 1999, invited by P.S.1 Contemporary Art Center and organized by Klaus Biesenbach, Schlingensief carried out a performance at the Statue of Liberty in New York City, where, kneeling down at the foot of the statue, he handed Germany over to globalization.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://press.moma.org/wp-content/files_mf/schlingensief_walltexts.pdf|title=Searching for Germany \u201899|website=press.moma.org|access-date=26 September 2017}}</ref>\n\nHis exhibition \"The Last Hour\", with its twisted metalwork from a crashed car, footage of a long tunnel and paparazzi pictures of [[Princess Diana]], was in 2006 rejected by the [[Frieze Art Fair]] in London's Regent's Park and instead ended up in a little-known gallery space in [[Bethnal Green]].<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/culture-obituaries/film-obituaries/8100536/Christoph-Schlingensief.html Christoph Schlingensief obituary] ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', October 31, 2010.</ref> He later joined the [[Hauser & Wirth]] gallery. In 2007, the [[Haus der Kunst]], Munich, mounted an exhibition of Schlingensief's work; it presented ''African Twin Towers'' and short films that have been shot while the artist directed ''[[The Flying Dutchman (opera)|The Flying Dutchman]]'' at the [[Teatro Amazonas]] in Manaus, Brazil.<ref>[http://www.hausderkunst.de/index.php?id=667&tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=82&L=1 Christoph Schlingensief, \"18 Images a Second\", May 25 \u2013 September 16, 2007] Haus der Kunst, Munich.</ref>\n\n=== Theatre ===\n[[File:Deutschlandsuche99.jpg|thumb|Schlingensief speaking at the ''Deutschlandsuche 99'' performance in front of the Volksb\u00fchne, 1999]]\nIn the 1990s, Schlingensief directed a series of chaotic, satirical productions at the [[Volksb\u00fchne]] theatre in Berlin. He also directed a version of ''[[Hamlet]]'', subtitled, ''This is your Family, Nazi~Line'', which premiered in Switzerland, the so-called neutral territory equated with the Denmark of the opening line in [[Shakespeare]]'s play where there is something foul afoot. Events around the piece questioned and attacked Switzerland's 'neutrality' in the face of growing racism and extreme right wing movements. The artist duo [[Ubermorgen]] provided the Internet platform ''Nazi~Line''<ref>[http://www.naziline.de] Nazi~Line</ref> for the project, where former members of Neo Nazi groups were sought and then cast as actors to play characters in the drama on stage as a way of re-integrating the ex-Neo-Nazis with the common workforce of the theatre.\n\nSchlingensief's work covered a variety of media, including installation and the ubiquitous 'talk show' and has in many cases led to audience members leaving the theatre space with Schlingensief and his colleagues to take part in events such as ''Passion Impossible, Wake Up Call for Germany'' 1997 or ''Chance 2000, Vote for Yourself'' in which he formed the ''Last Chance Party'' where anyone could become a candidate themselves in the run up to the [[1998 German federal election|federal election of 1998 in Germany]].<ref name=\"Former Auteur in Love With Outrage\"/> The same year he made a performance project for an Austrian Festival for new art [[Steirisher Herbst]] called ''Chance 2000 for Graz'': eight pillars were built at the central [[Marienplatz]] square, where homeless people were invited to sit on, and the deal was that the one who sat there longest could win 7,000 shillings, plus every day the artist threw 20,000 shillings on passers-by in front of the eyes of those who sat on the pillars.<ref>[http://offsite.kulturserver-graz.at/projekte/657.html Christoph Schlingensief  Chance 2000 f\u00fcr Graz] ''[[OFFSITE GRAZ]]''.</ref> The project was interrupted with help of the right-wing [[Freedom Party of Austria]], that collected 10,000 signatures against it.\n\nWith his demands for people to \"prove they exist\" in an age of total TV coverage and \"act, act, act\" in the sense of becoming active not 'actors', his work could be considered a direct legacy of [[Bertolt Brecht]], as it demands involvement as opposed to passivity and merely looking on as is the case in traditional text-based theatre. In an age of extreme media fatigue, his was a fresh voice albeit and undisputedly containing echoes of the past, often humorous and subversive yet never cynical. His influences included [[Joseph Beuys]] and his idea of [[social sculpture]], and artists [[Allan Kaprow]] and [[Dieter Roth]]. At the time of his death, he was involved in productions for the [[Ruhrtriennale]]<ref name=\"Apthorp\">Shirley Apthorp (August 23, 2010), [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-08-22/schlingensief-director-who-put-rotten-bunny-on-bayreuth-stage-dies-at-49.html Schlingensief, Who Put Putrid Bunny on Bayreuth Stage, Is Dead] ''[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]]''.</ref> and for the [[Berlin Staatsoper]]'s \"Metanoia\".<ref>George Loomis (October 12, 2010), [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/13/arts/13iht-loomis13.html The New Opera 'Metanoia' Goes On, but Without Its Provocateur] ''[[The New York Times]]''.</ref>\n\n=== Opera ===\nIn 2004, at the invitation of [[Wolfgang Wagner|Wolfgang]] and [[Katharina Wagner]] and to rave reviews,<ref>Jeremy Eichler (July 27, 2004), [https://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/27/arts/critic-s-notebook-a-hullabaloo-for-an-opening-at-bayreuth.html A Hullabaloo For an Opening At Bayreuth] ''[[The New York Times]]''.</ref> he staged [[Richard Wagner]]'s ''[[Parsifal]]'' for the [[Bayreuth Festival]].

The plan explains that the transportation sector accounts for emissions of about 16.5 million [[ton]]s of {{CO2}}, which is about one third of the total [[greenhouse gas emissions]] produced domestically in Norway. And road traffic, including both private cars and heavy vehicles, account for about 10 million tons of {{Co2}}. The NTP set policies and actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from private cars, trucks, ships, aircraft and construction equipment by about one half until 2030.<ref name=NTP01/><ref name=NTP02/>\n\nIn order to achieve this objective, among others, the NTP sets the goal for all sales of new cars, urban buses and light commercial vehicles in 2025 to be [[zero emission vehicles]], this is, all-electric and [[hydrogen vehicle]]s. By 2030, heavy-duty vans, 75% of new long-distance buses, and 50% of new trucks must be zero emission vehicles.<ref name=Outlook2018/><ref name=NTP01/><ref name=NTP02/><ref name=NTP03/> Also, by 2030, 40% of all ships in short sea shipping should be using biofuels or be low- or zero-emission ships. The proposed strategy states that until zero-emission vehicles take over, all internal combustion engine cars sold be plug-in hybrids, and wherever possible, biofuels must be used. Also, government agencies should as far as possible make use of biofuels, low- and zero-emission technologies in private and hired vehicles and vessels. The plan also calls to support the deployment of zero emission vehicles, but also for the reduction of the existing incentives, and proposes to invest more in public transport, walking and cycling.<ref name=NTP01>{{cite web|url=http://www.side3.no/motor/ntp-na-kommer-elbil-bakrusen/3423197581.html |title=NTP: N\u00e5 kommer elbil-bakrusen |language=Norwegian |trans-title=NTP: Now Comes EV Hangover |first = Magnus |last=Blaker |publisher=Side3.no |date=2016-02-29 |accessdate=2016-03-06}}</ref><ref name=NTP02>{{cite web|url=http://www.kystverket.no/Nyheter/2016/februar/ntp-klimautslippene-ma-kuttes/ |title=NTP: Klimautslippene m\u00e5 kuttes |language=Norwegian |trans-title=NTP: Greenhouse gas emissions must be cut  |publisher=[[Norwegian Coastal Administration]] |date=2016-02-29|accessdate=2016-03-06}}</ref><ref name=NTP03>{{cite news |url=http://www.hybridcars.com/norway-aiming-for-100-percent-zero-emission-vehicle-sales-by-2025/ | title=Norway Aiming For 100-Percent Zero Emission Vehicle Sales By 2025 |first=Jeff |last=Cobb|work=HybridCars.com |date=2016-03-08 |accessdate=2016-03-09}}</ref>\n\n===Criticism of the incentives===\n[[File:Oslo taxi Tesla.jpg|thumb|[[Tesla Roadster (2008)|Tesla Roadster]] providing [[taxi cab]] service in Oslo]]\n\nSince 2013 several complaints and criticism have arisen due to the rapid increase in the number of electric vehicles on the roads as a result of the existing incentives to promote EV adoption, and particularly about the non-fiscal incentives. These include high public subsidies as compared to the value of the reduced [[carbon footprint]] of electric vehicles; the [[Modal share|travel mode]] shift by people who buy an electric vehicle as a second car instead of taking buses and trains; the potential traffic congestion in Oslo's bus lanes due to the increasing number of electric cars; the loss of revenue for some ferry operators due to the large number of electric cars exempted from payment; and shortage of parking spaces for owners of conventional cars due to preference to electric cars and lack of a cap on parking time.\n\n====Excessive subsidies====\n\nAccording to the results of a study published by [[Reuters]] in March 2013, prepared by Bjart Holtsmark, an analyst of [[Statistics Norway]], the tax exemptions on the purchase of an electric car are worth almost {{USD|11,000}} in comparison to the fully taxed price of a regular [[internal combustion engine]] car, which is equivalent to {{USD|1,400}} a year over a car's lifetime (8 years). The value of the toll exemption for driving into Oslo are worth {{USD|1,400}} per year, the free parking is worth {{USD|5,000}} per year, and electric cars avoid other charges worth {{USD|400}} a year. Without adding value to the benefit of driving in bus lanes, the annual benefit of owning an electric car in Oslo is estimated at {{USD|8,200}} per car, per year. The analysis used a [[Toyota Prius Plug-in Hybrid]] as the benchmark vehicle. Mr. Holtsmark also pointed out that \"by encouraging people who can afford it to buy a second car instead of taking buses and trains, the electric car scheme may ironically be aggravating environmental problems and causing traffic jams.\"<ref name=Reuters032013/><ref name=Rebuttal/>\n\nThe Norwegian project ''Gr\u00f8nn bil'' (Green Car) disputed these figures because they consider the analysis is based on unrealistic assumptions. The group argues that the analysis used a very short total vehicle lifespan of 7.8 years, while Norway's average is closer to 18 years; it is very unlikely that a vehicle can be parked in Oslo between 1,875 hours and 3,000 hours per year to save the estimated {{USD|5.000}} considering the existing time limits for parking; and the typical EV owner drives around {{Convert|15,000|km|mi|abbr=on}} per year, not the {{Convert|6,500|km|mi|abbr=on}} implicit in the analysis. Using what they consider more realistic assumptions, ''Gr\u00f8nn bil'' estimates that the annual benefit of owning an electric car in Oslo is estimated at {{USD|3,336}} per car, per year, 40% of Holtsmark's estimation. They also found that the cost per tonne of {{co2}} emissions reduced is {{USD|2,499}}, not the {{USD|13,600}} estimated by Holtsmark.<ref name=Rebuttal>{{cite web|url=http://www.gronnbil.no/nyheter/highly-misleading-figures-regarding-norwegian-ev-benefits-in-reuters-article-article326-239.html|title=Highly misleading figures regarding Norwegian EV benefits in Reuters article|author=Ole Henrik Hannisdahl|publisher=Gr\u00f8nn bil|date=2012-03-22|accessdate=2012-04-06}}</ref>\n\n====Bus lane congestion====\n\nIn December 2013 the newspaper ''[[Budstikka]]'' conducted an informal test to measure the difference in travel time between an electric car and a gasoline-powered car during the morning rush hour on a stretch of road between the suburban municipality of [[Asker]] in [[Akershus]], and [[Sk\u00f8yen]], a neighborhood of Oslo. The electric car completed the trip in 19 minutes using the [[bus lane]] while it took 51 minutes for the conventional car traveling in the normal lanes.

The newspaper found that a total of 829 vehicles used the bus lane between 7:30 and 8:30&nbsp;a.m., of which, 618 vehicles were electric cars (74.5%). Buses accounted for only 7.5% of the traffic in the bus lane, and taxis, two-wheelers and mini-buses made up the rest. The Deputy Director of the [[Institute of Transport Economics]] (T\u00d8I) explained that the normal capacity of a highway lane is between 1,800 and 2,000 vehicles per hour, but because of the ramp entrances and exits, and the buses maneuvering in and out the bus lane to do their stops, the traffic flow starts to become troublesome when the number of vehicles in the bus lane is about 1,000 vehicles per hour. Although by December 2013 the traffic is approaching this limit, T\u00d8I's Deputy Director did not want to predict when this critical situation will occur. The Manager of the green car advocate group Gr\u00f8nn Bil warned that \"if the only reason people bought an electric car is to drive in the bus lane, they will probably be disappointed sooner or later.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.budstikka.no/nyheter/elbilene-kan-gi-full-stopp-i-kollektivfeltet-neste-ar-1.8203938|title=Elbilene kan gi full stopp i kollektivfeltet neste \u00e5r|language=Norwegian|trans-title=Electric cars can cause full stop in the bus lanes next year|author1=Nils H.

The accelerated growth of electric cars on some ferry routes has caused complaints from [[ferryboat]] operators due to the increasing loss on their [[farebox]] revenues. According to FosenNamsos Sea AS, an operator with four ferry lines servicing [[Hordaland]] county, during the first seven months of 2014 the number of electric vehicles riding the service [[Krokeidet]]-[[Hufthamar]] from Hordaland increased by 215% compared to the same period last year, for a total of 9,226 electric cars not paying the ferry fee through the end of July. The company argues that \"''no one could foresee the tremendous growth of electric cars we see on some ferry routes, but the [[Austevoll]] satellite connection involves a significant loss of revenue for us.''\"<ref name=ferries/>\n\nOn 1 June 2014, the company's home county of [[S\u00f8r-Tr\u00f8ndelag]] repealed the payment exemption for electric vehicles on the county ferries. The company has also requested to Transport of Hordaland a similar end of the exemption or some form of the income loss compensation. FosenNamsos Sea AS has argued that the financial burden should be on the government not the ferry operators. {{As of|2014|09|01}}, the county of Hordaland had 5,016 registered electric cars, the second largest in Norway after Oslo.

The study found that the typical electric car owner is a middle-aged family father with higher education and income, and he owns a Nissan Leaf as one of two cars. A total of 85% of the respondents had two or more cars in their household because they need a second car for longer journeys given the limited range current electric cars can provide. However, for everyday needs, the study found that one electric car is sufficient. Norwegians travel 42&nbsp;km on average every day, mostly by car. Based on the survey, the study found that 15% of the electric car owners do their daily travel with just their one electric car.

About 5% of the respondents had more than one electric car, as some owners kept their old electric car (such as Th!nk and Buddy) when they bought a new one. The survey showed that in most cases electric cars replaced a traditional car (87%), but also use of public transport (10%), and walking and bicycling (1%). Regarding everyday use of electric cars, the study found that owners use the electric car mostly for commuting to work (89.6%), shopping (88.4%) and driving to after work activities (77.0%). Other uses include delivery of children to school or kindergarten (40.9%) and for business purposes (40.2%). On the other hand, use of the electric car for holiday travel is very limited (11.7%).<ref name=Survey2013/>\n\nAs for the charging patterns, the 2013 survey found that 85% of the respondents could charge in their own garage or parking lot, and 10% had access to charging in the shared apartment building where they live. This means that 95% of the respondents were able to charge their electric cars at home during the night.

The study's aim was to identified how the plug-in vehicles are used, why they are bought and how the technology is rated compared to owners of [[internal combustion engine]] (ICE) vehicles. The sample consisted of 3,111 all-electric vehicles (BEV) owners, 2,065 private plug-in hybrid (PHEV) owners, and 3,080 ICE vehicle owners.<ref name=TOI2016/> The study found that buyers of BEVs and PHEVs have different transport needs but both are motivated by economy of use and environment, whereas all-electric vehicle owners are also motivated by the free toll road incentive. The survey showed that normally diesel and gasoline vehicles are replaced with the purchase of a plug-in vehicle, but a larger share of battery electric vehicles become extra vehicles in households. BEV owners are younger, have more children, travel a longer distance to work and own more vehicles than other vehicle owners.<ref name=TOI2016/>\n\n[[File:Elbilfestival i Geiranger.jpg|thumb|275px|Electric vehicle festival in [[Geiranger]]]]\nMost BEV owners (71%) also own an ICEV, 4% a PHEV, and 4% more than one BEV. The remaining 21% only have one BEV. 46% of PHEV owners and 48% of ICEV owners belong to single vehicle household. The most multipurpose BEV, [[Tesla Model S]], is twice as common in single BEV households as in households also owning ICEVs, and four times as common in households owning several BEVs.<ref name=TOI2016/> Based on the survey, the researchers found that plug-in hybrid owners in Norway drive on average 55% of their annual distance in charge-depleting or all-electric mode ([[EV mode]]), and the share goes up to about 63% for work trips. The share of electric travel is higher for trips to work and in the summer, and lower in the winter. The average plug-in hybrid user in the survey drives 60% of the total distance in EV mode in the summer and 53% in winter.

Only 6% of BEV owners and 5% of PHEV owners never charge at home. Charging at work is relatively common among BEV owners, 28% do it more than twice a week, 38% weekly. About 21% of PHEV owners do it at least weekly. Charging elsewhere is rare, but BEVs owners more frequently recharged at public charging stations and shopping centers than\nPHEV owners. Fast charging is used for irregular trips where users plan to use fast chargers to accomplish the trip or to solve a problem on the go. Most battery electric vehicle owners manage everyday life well and are satisfied with the vehicle which in combination with attractive local incentives not available to plug-in hybrid owners and other vehicle users.<ref name=TOI2016/>\n\nPeer-to-peer influences is particularly important to diffusion of battery electric vehicles being the biggest source of information leading to the purchase. Plug-in hybrid buyers received most information leading to the purchase from dealers and advertising material. The four reasons most frequently mentioned by the 89% of BEV owners who say they will buy a BEV again are economy of use, environmental performance, future proof technology, and the free usage of toll roads without paying. Less than 1% will not buy a BEV again. The reasons not to buy again are range and charging issues. The three main reasons why 80% of PHEV owners say they will buy one again are economy of use, environmental performance and that the technology is future proof. Only 2% will not buy a PHEV again. The main reasons not to buy again are the short range in all-electric mode and inability to use EV mode when it is cold.<ref name=TOI2016/>\n\n===2018 survey===\n\nThe Norwegian Electric Vehicle Association (''Norsk Elbilforening'') conducted a survey among all-electric car owners in June 2018, with a total of 9,520 respondents.

Figures for 2014 and 2015 correspond only to new car registrations. The breakdown between new and used import for the Nissan Leaf and the Kia Soul EV is shown because these are the two PEV models with the largest share of used import registrations (almost 70%).<!--The source providing registration figures for both used and new registrations stopped publishing them in September 2014.

Source: Statistisk sentralbyr\u00e5 (Statistics Norway).]]\n\nDespite having for many years the world's highest growth rates and highest penetration of EVs, Norway's crude oil consumption for motor vehicles increased from 2013 to 2016, particularly dutiable diesel fuel. One factor in the slow decline of oil consumption is Norway's relatively rapid population growth. Another factor is the significant number of gasoline- and diesel-powered vehicles still on the roads, with only 5% being plug-in electric passenger cars by the end of 2016.<ref name=TopTen2016/><ref name=OilForbes/>\n\nHowever, according to [[Forbes]], government figures for the sales of petroleum products in 2017, show that for the first time since 2014 Norway's consumption of gasoline and diesel declined across the board in 2017. Motor gasoline sales declined by 2.9%, dutiable diesel fell by 2.7%, and duty-free diesel (used by agricultural equipment) declined by 2.6%. This decline follows oil sales that were flat in 2014, and then grew by 1% in 2015 and 3.2% in 2016.<ref name=OilForbes>{{cite news | url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/rrapier/2018/05/24/electric-vehicles-could-finally-be-reducing-norways-fuel-consumption/#231f27c23ff6 |title=Electric Vehicles Could Finally Be Reducing Norway's Fuel Consumption | first=Robert | last= Rapier | work=[[Forbes]] | date=2017-05-24 | accessdate=2018-10-23}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Elbil Parkering Plass Oslo 10 2018 3806.jpg|thumb|450px|center|All-electric cars at a dedicated parking lot reserved for charging in Oslo. {{Asof|2016|12}}, plug-in electrics represented 5% of all passenger cars on the road,<ref name=TopTen2016/><ref name=OilForbes/> and 10% by the end of October 2018.<ref name=Norway10pct/>]]\n\n== Effects on average fleet CO<sub>2</sub> emissions ==\n\n[[File:Average fleet CO2 emissions Norway.png|thumb|275px|Historical trend of annual average new fleet {{CO2}} emissions in Norway (2011-2018).<br>Source: Norwegian Road Federation (OFV)]]\n\nA 2009 [[Directive (European Union)|European Union regulation]] set a mandatory [[European emission standards#Obligatory vehicle CO2 emission limits|average {{CO2}} emissions target for new cars]] of 130 g/km, that were phased in between 2012 and 2015.

And road traffic, including both private cars and heavy vehicles, account for about 10 million tons of {{Co2}}. The NTP set policies and actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from private cars, trucks, ships, aircraft and construction equipment by about one half until 2030.<ref name=NTP01/><ref name=NTP02/>\n\nIn order to achieve this objective, among others, the NTP sets the goal for all sales of new cars, urban buses and light commercial vehicles in 2025 to be [[zero emission vehicles]], this is, all-electric and [[hydrogen vehicle]]s. By 2030, heavy-duty vans, 75% of new long-distance buses, and 50% of new trucks must be zero emission vehicles.<ref name=Outlook2018/><ref name=NTP01/><ref name=NTP02/><ref name=NTP03/> Also, by 2030, 40% of all ships in short sea shipping should be using biofuels or be low- or zero-emission ships. The proposed strategy states that until zero-emission vehicles take over, all internal combustion engine cars sold be plug-in hybrids, and wherever possible, biofuels must be used. Also, government agencies should as far as possible make use of biofuels, low- and zero-emission technologies in private and hired vehicles and vessels. The plan also calls to support the deployment of zero emission vehicles, but also for the reduction of the existing incentives, and proposes to invest more in public transport, walking and cycling.<ref name=NTP01>{{cite web|url=http://www.side3.no/motor/ntp-na-kommer-elbil-bakrusen/3423197581.html |title=NTP: N\u00e5 kommer elbil-bakrusen |language=Norwegian |trans-title=NTP: Now Comes EV Hangover |first = Magnus |last=Blaker |publisher=Side3.no |date=2016-02-29 |accessdate=2016-03-06}}</ref><ref name=NTP02>{{cite web|url=http://www.kystverket.no/Nyheter/2016/februar/ntp-klimautslippene-ma-kuttes/ |title=NTP: Klimautslippene m\u00e5 kuttes |language=Norwegian |trans-title=NTP: Greenhouse gas emissions must be cut  |publisher=[[Norwegian Coastal Administration]] |date=2016-02-29|accessdate=2016-03-06}}</ref><ref name=NTP03>{{cite news |url=http://www.hybridcars.com/norway-aiming-for-100-percent-zero-emission-vehicle-sales-by-2025/ | title=Norway Aiming For 100-Percent Zero Emission Vehicle Sales By 2025 |first=Jeff |last=Cobb|work=HybridCars.com |date=2016-03-08 |accessdate=2016-03-09}}</ref>\n\n===Criticism of the incentives===\n[[File:Oslo taxi Tesla.jpg|thumb|[[Tesla Roadster (2008)|Tesla Roadster]] providing [[taxi cab]] service in Oslo]]\n\nSince 2013 several complaints and criticism have arisen due to the rapid increase in the number of electric vehicles on the roads as a result of the existing incentives to promote EV adoption, and particularly about the non-fiscal incentives. These include high public subsidies as compared to the value of the reduced [[carbon footprint]] of electric vehicles; the [[Modal share|travel mode]] shift by people who buy an electric vehicle as a second car instead of taking buses and trains; the potential traffic congestion in Oslo's bus lanes due to the increasing number of electric cars; the loss of revenue for some ferry operators due to the large number of electric cars exempted from payment; and shortage of parking spaces for owners of conventional cars due to preference to electric cars and lack of a cap on parking time.\n\n====Excessive subsidies====\n\nAccording to the results of a study published by [[Reuters]] in March 2013, prepared by Bjart Holtsmark, an analyst of [[Statistics Norway]], the tax exemptions on the purchase of an electric car are worth almost {{USD|11,000}} in comparison to the fully taxed price of a regular [[internal combustion engine]] car, which is equivalent to {{USD|1,400}} a year over a car's lifetime (8 years). The value of the toll exemption for driving into Oslo are worth {{USD|1,400}} per year, the free parking is worth {{USD|5,000}} per year, and electric cars avoid other charges worth {{USD|400}} a year. Without adding value to the benefit of driving in bus lanes, the annual benefit of owning an electric car in Oslo is estimated at {{USD|8,200}} per car, per year. The analysis used a [[Toyota Prius Plug-in Hybrid]] as the benchmark vehicle. Mr. Holtsmark also pointed out that \"by encouraging people who can afford it to buy a second car instead of taking buses and trains, the electric car scheme may ironically be aggravating environmental problems and causing traffic jams.\"<ref name=Reuters032013/><ref name=Rebuttal/>\n\nThe Norwegian project ''Gr\u00f8nn bil'' (Green Car) disputed these figures because they consider the analysis is based on unrealistic assumptions. The group argues that the analysis used a very short total vehicle lifespan of 7.8 years, while Norway's average is closer to 18 years; it is very unlikely that a vehicle can be parked in Oslo between 1,875 hours and 3,000 hours per year to save the estimated {{USD|5.000}} considering the existing time limits for parking; and the typical EV owner drives around {{Convert|15,000|km|mi|abbr=on}} per year, not the {{Convert|6,500|km|mi|abbr=on}} implicit in the analysis. Using what they consider more realistic assumptions, ''Gr\u00f8nn bil'' estimates that the annual benefit of owning an electric car in Oslo is estimated at {{USD|3,336}} per car, per year, 40% of Holtsmark's estimation. They also found that the cost per tonne of {{co2}} emissions reduced is {{USD|2,499}}, not the {{USD|13,600}} estimated by Holtsmark.<ref name=Rebuttal>{{cite web|url=http://www.gronnbil.no/nyheter/highly-misleading-figures-regarding-norwegian-ev-benefits-in-reuters-article-article326-239.html|title=Highly misleading figures regarding Norwegian EV benefits in Reuters article|author=Ole Henrik Hannisdahl|publisher=Gr\u00f8nn bil|date=2012-03-22|accessdate=2012-04-06}}</ref>\n\n====Bus lane congestion====\n\nIn December 2013 the newspaper ''[[Budstikka]]'' conducted an informal test to measure the difference in travel time between an electric car and a gasoline-powered car during the morning rush hour on a stretch of road between the suburban municipality of [[Asker]] in [[Akershus]], and [[Sk\u00f8yen]], a neighborhood of Oslo. The electric car completed the trip in 19 minutes using the [[bus lane]] while it took 51 minutes for the conventional car traveling in the normal lanes.

The newspaper found that a total of 829 vehicles used the bus lane between 7:30 and 8:30&nbsp;a.m., of which, 618 vehicles were electric cars (74.5%). Buses accounted for only 7.5% of the traffic in the bus lane, and taxis, two-wheelers and mini-buses made up the rest. The Deputy Director of the [[Institute of Transport Economics]] (T\u00d8I) explained that the normal capacity of a highway lane is between 1,800 and 2,000 vehicles per hour, but because of the ramp entrances and exits, and the buses maneuvering in and out the bus lane to do their stops, the traffic flow starts to become troublesome when the number of vehicles in the bus lane is about 1,000 vehicles per hour. Although by December 2013 the traffic is approaching this limit, T\u00d8I's Deputy Director did not want to predict when this critical situation will occur. The Manager of the green car advocate group Gr\u00f8nn Bil warned that \"if the only reason people bought an electric car is to drive in the bus lane, they will probably be disappointed sooner or later.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.budstikka.no/nyheter/elbilene-kan-gi-full-stopp-i-kollektivfeltet-neste-ar-1.8203938|title=Elbilene kan gi full stopp i kollektivfeltet neste \u00e5r|language=Norwegian|trans-title=Electric cars can cause full stop in the bus lanes next year|author1=Nils H.

The accelerated growth of electric cars on some ferry routes has caused complaints from [[ferryboat]] operators due to the increasing loss on their [[farebox]] revenues. According to FosenNamsos Sea AS, an operator with four ferry lines servicing [[Hordaland]] county, during the first seven months of 2014 the number of electric vehicles riding the service [[Krokeidet]]-[[Hufthamar]] from Hordaland increased by 215% compared to the same period last year, for a total of 9,226 electric cars not paying the ferry fee through the end of July.

The study found that the typical electric car owner is a middle-aged family father with higher education and income, and he owns a Nissan Leaf as one of two cars. A total of 85% of the respondents had two or more cars in their household because they need a second car for longer journeys given the limited range current electric cars can provide. However, for everyday needs, the study found that one electric car is sufficient. Norwegians travel 42&nbsp;km on average every day, mostly by car. Based on the survey, the study found that 15% of the electric car owners do their daily travel with just their one electric car.

About 5% of the respondents had more than one electric car, as some owners kept their old electric car (such as Th!nk and Buddy) when they bought a new one. The survey showed that in most cases electric cars replaced a traditional car (87%), but also use of public transport (10%), and walking and bicycling (1%). Regarding everyday use of electric cars, the study found that owners use the electric car mostly for commuting to work (89.6%), shopping (88.4%) and driving to after work activities (77.0%). Other uses include delivery of children to school or kindergarten (40.9%) and for business purposes (40.2%).

The study's aim was to identified how the plug-in vehicles are used, why they are bought and how the technology is rated compared to owners of [[internal combustion engine]] (ICE) vehicles. The sample consisted of 3,111 all-electric vehicles (BEV) owners, 2,065 private plug-in hybrid (PHEV) owners, and 3,080 ICE vehicle owners.<ref name=TOI2016/> The study found that buyers of BEVs and PHEVs have different transport needs but both are motivated by economy of use and environment, whereas all-electric vehicle owners are also motivated by the free toll road incentive. The survey showed that normally diesel and gasoline vehicles are replaced with the purchase of a plug-in vehicle, but a larger share of battery electric vehicles become extra vehicles in households. BEV owners are younger, have more children, travel a longer distance to work and own more vehicles than other vehicle owners.<ref name=TOI2016/>\n\n[[File:Elbilfestival i Geiranger.jpg|thumb|275px|Electric vehicle festival in [[Geiranger]]]]\nMost BEV owners (71%) also own an ICEV, 4% a PHEV, and 4% more than one BEV. The remaining 21% only have one BEV. 46% of PHEV owners and 48% of ICEV owners belong to single vehicle household. The most multipurpose BEV, [[Tesla Model S]], is twice as common in single BEV households as in households also owning ICEVs, and four times as common in households owning several BEVs.<ref name=TOI2016/> Based on the survey, the researchers found that plug-in hybrid owners in Norway drive on average 55% of their annual distance in charge-depleting or all-electric mode ([[EV mode]]), and the share goes up to about 63% for work trips. The share of electric travel is higher for trips to work and in the summer, and lower in the winter. The average plug-in hybrid user in the survey drives 60% of the total distance in EV mode in the summer and 53% in winter. The estimate for work trips is higher at 70% in the summer and 59% in winter. On the other hand, the study found that battery electric vehicles are driven more in total and in everyday traffic.<ref name=TOI2016>{{cite web| url=https://www.toi.no/getfile.php?mmfileid=43161 | title=Learning from Norwegian Battery Electric and Plug-in Hybrid Vehicle users |first1=Erik |last1=Figenbaum |first2=Marika |last2=Kolbenstvedt |publisher=[[Institute of Transport Economics]] (T\u00d8I), Norwegian Centre for Transport Research |date=June 2016 |accessdate=2016-08-17}} ''T\u00d8I report 1492/2016. See: \"Hydropower use\" - pp.1, \"Estimated percentage in EV mode\" - pp. 55.''</ref>\n\nAccording to the survey results, plug-in vehicles are mainly charged at home, whether in their garage or at an outdoor parking on the owner property, with 59% of BEV owners and 74% of PHEV owners charging this way. Only 6% of BEV owners and 5% of PHEV owners never charge at home. Charging at work is relatively common among BEV owners, 28% do it more than twice a week, 38% weekly. About 21% of PHEV owners do it at least weekly. Charging elsewhere is rare, but BEVs owners more frequently recharged at public charging stations and shopping centers than\nPHEV owners. Fast charging is used for irregular trips where users plan to use fast chargers to accomplish the trip or to solve a problem on the go. Most battery electric vehicle owners manage everyday life well and are satisfied with the vehicle which in combination with attractive local incentives not available to plug-in hybrid owners and other vehicle users.<ref name=TOI2016/>\n\nPeer-to-peer influences is particularly important to diffusion of battery electric vehicles being the biggest source of information leading to the purchase. Plug-in hybrid buyers received most information leading to the purchase from dealers and advertising material. The four reasons most frequently mentioned by the 89% of BEV owners who say they will buy a BEV again are economy of use, environmental performance, future proof technology, and the free usage of toll roads without paying. Less than 1% will not buy a BEV again. The reasons not to buy again are range and charging issues. The three main reasons why 80% of PHEV owners say they will buy one again are economy of use, environmental performance and that the technology is future proof. Only 2% will not buy a PHEV again. The main reasons not to buy again are the short range in all-electric mode and inability to use EV mode when it is cold.<ref name=TOI2016/>\n\n===2018 survey===\n\nThe Norwegian Electric Vehicle Association (''Norsk Elbilforening'') conducted a survey among all-electric car owners in June 2018, with a total of 9,520 respondents. The study found that 63% of Norwegian households with electric cars also have a fossil car or hybrid car, down from 70% in 2017.

Figures for 2014 and 2015 correspond only to new car registrations. The breakdown between new and used import for the Nissan Leaf and the Kia Soul EV is shown because these are the two PEV models with the largest share of used import registrations (almost 70%).<!--The source providing registration figures for both used and new registrations stopped publishing them in September 2014.

Source: Statistisk sentralbyr\u00e5 (Statistics Norway).]]\n\nDespite having for many years the world's highest growth rates and highest penetration of EVs, Norway's crude oil consumption for motor vehicles increased from 2013 to 2016, particularly dutiable diesel fuel. One factor in the slow decline of oil consumption is Norway's relatively rapid population growth. Another factor is the significant number of gasoline- and diesel-powered vehicles still on the roads, with only 5% being plug-in electric passenger cars by the end of 2016.<ref name=TopTen2016/><ref name=OilForbes/>\n\nHowever, according to [[Forbes]], government figures for the sales of petroleum products in 2017, show that for the first time since 2014 Norway's consumption of gasoline and diesel declined across the board in 2017. Motor gasoline sales declined by 2.9%, dutiable diesel fell by 2.7%, and duty-free diesel (used by agricultural equipment) declined by 2.6%. This decline follows oil sales that were flat in 2014, and then grew by 1% in 2015 and 3.2% in 2016.<ref name=OilForbes>{{cite news | url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/rrapier/2018/05/24/electric-vehicles-could-finally-be-reducing-norways-fuel-consumption/#231f27c23ff6 |title=Electric Vehicles Could Finally Be Reducing Norway's Fuel Consumption | first=Robert | last= Rapier | work=[[Forbes]] | date=2017-05-24 | accessdate=2018-10-23}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Elbil Parkering Plass Oslo 10 2018 3806.jpg|thumb|450px|center|All-electric cars at a dedicated parking lot reserved for charging in Oslo. {{Asof|2016|12}}, plug-in electrics represented 5% of all passenger cars on the road,<ref name=TopTen2016/><ref name=OilForbes/> and 10% by the end of October 2018.<ref name=Norway10pct/>]]\n\n== Effects on average fleet CO<sub>2</sub> emissions ==\n\n[[File:Average fleet CO2 emissions Norway.png|thumb|275px|Historical trend of annual average new fleet {{CO2}} emissions in Norway (2011-2018).<br>Source: Norwegian Road Federation (OFV)]]\n\nA 2009 [[Directive (European Union)|European Union regulation]] set a mandatory [[European emission standards#Obligatory vehicle CO2 emission limits|average {{CO2}} emissions target for new cars]] of 130 g/km, that were phased in between 2012 and 2015.

Johnson played 51 games (13 starts) with the Nuggets and averaged 9.4 points, 1.3 rebounds, and 5.1 assists.<ref name=\"bbr\">{{cite web|url=https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/j/johnsav01.html|title=Avery Johnson|work=basketball-reference.com|accessdate=December 23, 2016}}</ref> The Nuggets traded Johnson and three other players to the [[2001\u201302 Dallas Mavericks season|Dallas Mavericks]] on February 21, 2002. Johnson played 17 games all as a reserve with the Mavericks for the rest of the season.<ref name=\"bbr\"/>\n\nIn the 2002\u201303 season, Johnson played in 48 games as a reserve for the Mavericks, averaging 9.0 minutes per game. Johnson ended his NBA career in the 2003\u201304 season back with the [[2003\u201304 Golden State Warriors season|Golden State Warriors]]. He played 46 games with one start and averaged 4.6 points, 0.7 rebounds, and 2.4 assists.<ref name=\"bbr\"/>\n\n==Post-playing career==\n\n===Dallas Mavericks===\nOn October 28, 2004, Johnson retired from playing and signed as an assistant coach with the [[Dallas Mavericks]] under [[Don Nelson]]. Johnson had played under Nelson from 2001 to 2003, and it was understood from the beginning that he was being groomed to eventually succeed Nelson as [[head coach]]. His transition from assistant to head coach came five months later on March 19, 2005, after Nelson resigned.\n\nUnder Johnson, the Mavericks closed out the [[2004\u201305 NBA season|2004\u201305 season]] with a 16\u20132 run and a first-round playoff victory over the [[Houston Rockets]], before being eliminated by the [[Phoenix Suns]] in the second round of the [[NBA playoffs|playoffs]]. Johnson was named the April 2005 NBA Coach of the Month, only one month after becoming a head coach for the first time.\n[[file:Avery Johnson.jpg|thumb|170px|Johnson as the coach of the Mavs, 2008]]\nThe [[2005\u201306 NBA season|2005\u201306 season]] was even more successful for Johnson and was marked by a series of milestones. In November 2005, Johnson won his second NBA Coach of the Month award (which was also his second consecutive award, following the one he had won in April the previous season), making him the first NBA coach to win the award in his first two months as a head coach. On January 28, 2006, when the [[Dallas Mavericks]] defeated the [[Utah Jazz]], Johnson's record as head coach improved to 50\u201312, making Johnson the fastest coach to reach 50 wins. In February 2006, he was chosen to coach the [[2006 NBA All-Star Game|2006 NBA All-Star team]] for the [[Western Conference (NBA)|Western Conference]]. Although Johnson ultimately led the Mavericks to the second-best record in the Western Conference, the team entered the playoffs as the fourth seed in the West due to the structure of the [[2006 NBA Playoffs]] seeding. In April 2006, Johnson was rewarded for his success throughout the season with the 2006 [[NBA Coach of the Year Award]].\n\nIn June 2006, after defeating the [[Memphis Grizzlies]], the defending champion [[San Antonio Spurs]], and the [[Phoenix Suns]] in the first three rounds of the playoffs, Johnson led the Mavericks to their first ever [[2006 NBA Finals|NBA Finals]] appearance. However, the Mavs were defeated in [[Best-of-seven playoff|six games]] by the [[Miami Heat]], losing four straight after winning the first two games.\n\nOn December 31, 2006, Johnson became the fastest head coach (at the time) to win 100 games when his squad defeated the [[Denver Nuggets]]. This record was later broken by [[Tom Thibodeau]] and the [[Chicago Bulls]]. In the [[2006\u201307 NBA season|2006\u201307 season]], Johnson's Mavericks had the best record in the NBA with 67 wins and entered the playoffs as the top seed. However, his Mavericks lost to the eighth-seeded [[Golden State Warriors]], led by former Mavericks head coach [[Don Nelson]], in one of the biggest upsets in recent NBA history.\n\nWith the Mavs' win over the Grizzlies on November 18, 2007, Johnson became the fastest coach to reach 150 wins. Following the [[2007\u201308 Dallas Mavericks season|2007\u201308 season]], the Mavericks under Johnson were eliminated in the first round of the [[2008 NBA Playoffs|playoffs]] for the second year in a row. A day later, on April 30, 2008, Johnson was dismissed as head coach of the Mavericks and replaced by former [[NBA Coach of the Year]], [[Rick Carlisle]].<ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=3375306 ESPN \u2013 Mavs, Johnson part ways after team's playoff ouster \u2013 NBA<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.nba.com/mavericks/news/Avery_Johnson_dismissed_043008.html MAVERICKS: Avery Johnson dismissed as coach<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.nba.com/mavericks/news/Official_release_Johnson_relieved.html MAVERICKS: Official release: Mavericks relieve Avery Johnson of coaching duties<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n===First stint at ESPN===\nOn October 17, 2008, Johnson joined [[ESPN]] as a studio analyst.

In his first year as coach of the Nets, the team improved slightly, doubling its win total from the previous season and finishing 24\u201358. However, the next year saw no such improvement, as his team went 22\u201344 in the [[2011\u201312 NBA season|lockout-shortened season]].\n\nJohnson remained with the Nets when the team moved to Brooklyn in 2012. He was named the [[Eastern Conference (NBA)|Eastern Conference]] Coach of the Month for October and November 2012 following an 11\u20134 start to the season. Despite that early success, the team went on to lose ten of its next 13 games, and subsequently Johnson was fired from his head coaching position on December 27, 2012.<ref>{{cite

(basketball)|coach]] who most recently served as head coach of the [[Alabama Crimson Tide men's basketball]] team.\n\nJohnson spent 16 years in the [[National Basketball Association]] as a player, and subsequently served as the head coach of two NBA teams: the [[Dallas Mavericks]] and [[Brooklyn Nets|New Jersey/Brooklyn Nets]]. He led the Mavericks to their first [[NBA Finals]] appearance and to three consecutive 50+ win seasons. During his playing days, Johnson was known as the \"Little General\" for his small stature (by NBA standards), his leadership skills as a [[point guard]] (floor general), and his close friendship with former [[San Antonio Spurs]] teammate [[David Robinson (basketball)|David Robinson]] - himself nicknamed \"The Admiral\" based on his tenure at the Naval Academy.\n\n==Playing career==\n\n===College===\nAs a high school senior in 1983, Johnson led New Orleans' [[St. Augustine High School (New Orleans)|St. Augustine High School]] to a 35\u20130 record and the Class 4A Louisiana State Championship. Johnson matriculated at [[New Mexico Junior College]] before moving on to [[Cameron University]], and finally [[Southern University]], at which in his senior season in 1988 he led [[NCAA Division I]] with 13.3 assists per game, an all-time record.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ncaa.org/library/records/basketball/m_basketball_records_book/2007/2007_m_basketball_records.pdf |title=Official 2007 NCAA Men's Basketball Records Book, page 20 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070323023343/http://www.ncaa.org/library/records/basketball/m_basketball_records_book/2007/2007_m_basketball_records.pdf |archivedate=March 23, 2007}} &nbsp;{{small|(4.57&nbsp;[[Mebibyte|MiB]])}}; retrieved August 13, 2007</ref> In that season, he also averaged 11.4 points per game, making him the first men's Division I player ever to average double figures in points and assists in the same season\u2014a feat that was not duplicated until [[Jason Brickman]] of [[LIU Brooklyn Blackbirds men's basketball|LIU Brooklyn]] did so in [[2013\u201314 LIU Brooklyn Blackbirds men's basketball team|2013\u201314]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://espn.go.com/new-york/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/10538434/liu-brooklyn-brickman-reaches-1000-assists-final-game |title=Jason Brickman earns 1,000th assist |first=Kieran |last=Darcy |publisher=ESPN |date=March 1, 2014 |accessdate=March 2, 2014}}</ref>\n\nUpon [[graduation]] in 1988, Johnson was not selected in the [[1988 NBA draft|NBA draft]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.al.com/alabamabasketball/index.ssf/2015/04/avery_johnson_facts_alabama.html#3 |title=Get to know Avery Johnson with 15 facts, milestones and defining moments |publisher=[[The Birmingham News|AL.com]] |date=April 6, 2015 |accessdate=April 9, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Professional===\n\n====Palm Beach Stingrays (1988)====\nJohnson spent the summer of 1988 with the [[Palm Beach, Florida|Palm Beach]] Stingrays of the [[United States Basketball League]].

He made 18 assists on January 5, 1990 against the Miami Heat.<ref name=\"NBA player\"/>\n\nOn October 24, 1990, the SuperSonics traded Johnson to the [[1990\u201391 Denver Nuggets season|Denver Nuggets]] for a conditional pick in the [[1997 NBA draft]]. After playing 21 games, Johnson was waived from the Nuggets in December before signing with the [[1990\u201391 San Antonio Spurs season|San Antonio Spurs]] on January 17, 1991. Johnson played 47 games with seven starts for the Spurs and averaged 9.4 points, 2.1 rebounds, and 5.4 assists.<ref name=\"NBA player\"/>\n\nIn the beginning of the 1991\u201392 season, Johnson played 20 games and averaged 5.0 points and 6.8 assists for the Spurs before being waived in December. On January 10, 1992, Johnson signed the first of several 10-day contracts with the [[1991\u201392 Houston Rockets season|Houston Rockets]] that preceded a longer-term contract. Johnson scored a then-career-high 22 points against the [[Minnesota Timberwolves]] on January 28.<ref name=\"NBA player\"/>\n\nSigned as an unrestricted free agent, Johnson returned to the Spurs on November 19, 1992. Promoted to starter, Johnson averaged 8.7 points, 1.9 rebounds, and 7.5 assists and improved his field goal percentage to .502 in 75 games. In the playoffs, Johnson averaged 8.2 points and 8.1 assists.<ref name=\"NBA player\"/>\n\nJohnson signed with the [[1993\u201394 Golden State Warriors season|Golden State Warriors]] on October 25, 1993 and was named team captain just nine days into his signing. Starting 70 of 82 games, Johnson reached a new career high 10.9 points per game along with 5.3 assists per game.<ref name=\"NBA player\"/>\n\n====San Antonio Spurs (1994\u20132001)====\nJohnson is best known for his time with the Spurs from 1994 to 2001, and particularly his integral role on the [[1998\u201399 San Antonio Spurs season|1998\u201399 Spurs team]] that won the [[1999 NBA Finals|NBA championship]] against the [[New York Knicks]]. Most notably, Johnson made the go-ahead, championship-clinching shot in Game 5 on a jumper with 47 seconds remaining in the game.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/06/26/sports/nba-finals-spurs-win-title-as-knicks-dream-ends.html |title=N.B.A. FINALS; Spurs Win Title as Knicks' Dream Ends |first=Selena |last=Roberts |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=June 26, 1999 |accessdate=April 6, 2015}}</ref> The Spurs retired Johnson's number 6 on December 22, 2007.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/basketball/2007-12-23-186396253_x.htm |title=San Antonio Spurs retire Avery Johnson's No. 6 |first=Elizabeth |last=White |work=[[USA Today]] |date=December 23, 2007 |accessdate=April 6, 2015}}</ref> He was also inducted into the San Antonio Sports Hall of Fame on February 20, 2009.<ref>{{cite web|title=San Antonio Sports Hall of Fame Names Class of 2009 |publisher=San Antonio Sports Foundation |date=October 21, 2008 |url=http://www.sanantoniosports.org/releases/2009%20Inductees%20Announced_10_21_08.pdf |accessdate=April 6, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306122751/http://www.sanantoniosports.org/releases/2009%20Inductees%20Announced_10_21_08.pdf |archivedate=March 6, 2016}}</ref>\n\n====After the Spurs====\nOn July 19, 2001, Johnson signed as a free agent with the [[2001\u201302 Denver Nuggets season|Denver Nuggets]]. Johnson played 51 games (13 starts) with the Nuggets and averaged 9.4 points, 1.3 rebounds, and 5.1 assists.<ref name=\"bbr\">{{cite web|url=https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/j/johnsav01.html|title=Avery Johnson|work=basketball-reference.com|accessdate=December 23, 2016}}</ref> The Nuggets traded Johnson and three other players to the [[2001\u201302 Dallas Mavericks season|Dallas Mavericks]] on February 21, 2002. Johnson played 17 games all as a reserve with the Mavericks for the rest of the season.<ref name=\"bbr\"/>\n\nIn the 2002\u201303 season, Johnson played in 48 games as a reserve for the Mavericks, averaging 9.0 minutes per game. Johnson ended his NBA career in the 2003\u201304 season back with the [[2003\u201304 Golden State Warriors season|Golden State Warriors]]. He played 46 games with one start and averaged 4.6 points, 0.7 rebounds, and 2.4 assists.<ref name=\"bbr\"/>\n\n==Post-playing career==\n\n===Dallas Mavericks===\nOn October 28, 2004, Johnson retired from playing and signed as an assistant coach with the [[Dallas Mavericks]] under [[Don Nelson]]. Johnson had played under Nelson from 2001 to 2003, and it was understood from the beginning that he was being groomed to eventually succeed Nelson as [[head coach]]. His transition from assistant to head coach came five months later on March 19, 2005, after Nelson resigned.\n\nUnder Johnson, the Mavericks closed out the [[2004\u201305 NBA season|2004\u201305 season]] with a 16\u20132 run and a first-round playoff victory over the [[Houston Rockets]], before being eliminated by the [[Phoenix Suns]] in the second round of the [[NBA playoffs|playoffs]]. Johnson was named the April 2005 NBA Coach of the Month, only one month after becoming a head coach for the first time.\n\nThe [[2005\u201306 NBA season|2005\u201306 season]] was even more successful for Johnson and was marked by a series of milestones. In November 2005, Johnson won his second NBA Coach of the Month award (which was also his second consecutive award, following the one he had won in April the previous season), making him the first NBA coach to win the award in his first two months as a head coach. On January 28, 2006, when the [[Dallas Mavericks]] defeated the [[Utah Jazz]], Johnson's record as head coach improved to 50\u201312, making Johnson the fastest coach to reach 50 wins. In February 2006, he was chosen to coach the [[2006 NBA All-Star Game|2006 NBA All-Star team]] for the [[Western Conference (NBA)|Western Conference]]. Although Johnson ultimately led the Mavericks to the second-best record in the Western Conference, the team entered the playoffs as the fourth seed in the West due to the structure of the [[2006 NBA Playoffs]] seeding. In April 2006, Johnson was rewarded for his success throughout the season with the 2006 [[NBA Coach of the Year Award]].\n\nIn June 2006, after defeating the [[Memphis Grizzlies]], the defending champion [[San Antonio Spurs]], and the [[Phoenix Suns]] in the first three rounds of the playoffs, Johnson led the Mavericks to their first ever [[2006 NBA Finals|NBA Finals]] appearance. However, the Mavs were defeated in [[Best-of-seven playoff|six games]] by the [[Miami Heat]], losing four straight after winning the first two games.\n\nOn December 31, 2006, Johnson became the fastest head coach (at the time) to win 100 games when his squad defeated the [[Denver Nuggets]]. This record was later broken by [[Tom Thibodeau]] and the [[Chicago Bulls]]. In the [[2006\u201307 NBA season|2006\u201307 season]], Johnson's Mavericks had the best record in the NBA with 67 wins and entered the playoffs as the top seed. However, his Mavericks lost to the eighth-seeded [[Golden State Warriors]], led by former Mavericks head coach [[Don Nelson]], in one of the biggest upsets in recent NBA history.\n\nWith the Mavs' win over the Grizzlies on November 18, 2007, Johnson became the fastest coach to reach 150 wins. Following the [[2007\u201308 Dallas Mavericks season|2007\u201308 season]], the Mavericks under Johnson were eliminated in the first round of the [[2008 NBA Playoffs|playoffs]] for the second year in a row. A day later, on April 30, 2008, Johnson was dismissed as head coach of the Mavericks and replaced by former [[NBA Coach of the Year]], [[Rick Carlisle]].<ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=3375306 ESPN \u2013 Mavs, Johnson part ways after team's playoff ouster \u2013 NBA<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.nba.com/mavericks/news/Avery_Johnson_dismissed_043008.html MAVERICKS: Avery Johnson dismissed as coach<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.nba.com/mavericks/news/Official_release_Johnson_relieved.html MAVERICKS: Official release: Mavericks relieve Avery Johnson of coaching duties<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n===First stint at ESPN===\nOn October 17, 2008, Johnson joined [[ESPN]] as a studio analyst.

In his first year as coach of the Nets, the team improved slightly, doubling its win total from the previous season and finishing 24\u201358. However, the next year saw no such improvement, as his team went 22\u201344 in the [[2011\u201312 NBA season|lockout-shortened season]].\n\nJohnson remained with the Nets when the team moved to Brooklyn in 2012. He was named the [[Eastern Conference (NBA)|Eastern Conference]] Coach of the Month for October and November 2012 following an 11\u20134 start to the season. Despite that early success, the team went on to lose ten of its next 13 games, and subsequently Johnson was fired from his head coaching position on December 27, 2012.<ref>{{cite

According to the {{PH wikidata|population_as_of}}, it has a population of {{PH wikidata|population_total}} people.{{PH census|current}}\n\n==History==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2016}}\n\nBucay was established on October 29, 1846 and the first settlers were [[Itneg people|Itneg]]s. It became the first provincial capital of [[Abra (province)|Abra]] when the military form of government was set up in May 1847. At the back of the present municipal hall is the centuries-old fa\u00e7ade of the ruined ''Casa Real'' (Provincial Capitol Building). Across the town plaza, stand the centuries-old Catholic church, convent and learning school, Spanish structure house owned by then Don Teodoro Arias who served as [[Gobernadorcillo]] of Bucay in 1862, and the old American structure house which was built in 1908 and owned by then US Corporal Ernest D. Smith who served the [[Spanish\u2013American War]] and the [[Filipino-American war]] from 1896 to 1901. Prior to the invasion of the Spaniards, the place had become footfalls of invading headhunters from the dense jungles of the [[Cordillera Central (Luzon)|Cordillera range]].\n\nThere are two versions on how this town got its name as \"Bucay\". Some residents say that there was a tribe leader by the name of Bucay. When this leader was still young, while patrolling, he found a pretty young lass lying on the way which prompted him to extend assistance, and brought her home. After a period of time, he developed his love with the young lass and took her as his wife. In several occasions, the girl suddenly disappeared. At some instances, Bucay used to see her at the corner of his bamboo hut sitting alone with her bowed head which prompted him to approach and touch her, but always disappeared.\n\n==Geography==\nAmong the twenty-seven (27) towns of Abra, Bucay is the most centrally located, situated at {{coord|format=dms}}. It is bounded on the north by the towns of [[Tayum]] and [[Lagangilang]], on the south by [[Manabo]], on the east by [[Licuan-Baay]] and [[Sallapadan]], and on the west by [[Pe\u00f1arrubia, Abra|Pe\u00f1arrubia]], [[Bangued]] and [[Villaviciosa, Abra|Villaviciosa]].\n\nAccording to the [[Philippine Statistics Authority]], the {{PH wikidata|settlement_text}} has a land area of {{convert|{{PH wikidata|area}}|km2}}{{PSGC detail|area}} constituting {{percentage|{{PH wikidata|area}}|{{PH wikidata|area|Q13711}}|2|pad=yes}} of the {{convert|{{PH

According to the {{PH wikidata|population_as_of}}, it has a population of {{PH wikidata|population_total}} people.{{PH census|current}}\n\n==History==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2016}}\n\nBucay was established on October 29, 1846 and the first settlers were [[Itneg people|Itneg]]s. It became the first provincial capital of [[Abra (province)|Abra]] when the military form of government was set up in May 1847. At the back of the present municipal hall is the centuries-old fa\u00e7ade of the ruined ''Casa Real'' (Provincial Capitol Building). Across the town plaza, stand the centuries-old Catholic church, convent and learning school, Spanish structure house owned by then Don Teodoro Arias who served as [[Gobernadorcillo]] of Bucay in 1862, and the old American structure house which was built in 1908 and owned by then US Corporal Ernest D. Smith who served the [[Spanish\u2013American War]] and the [[Filipino-American war]] from 1896 to 1901. Prior to the invasion of the Spaniards, the place had become footfalls of invading headhunters from the dense jungles of the [[Cordillera Central (Luzon)|Cordillera range]].\n\nThere are two versions on how this town got its name as \"Bucay\". Some residents say that there was a tribe leader by the name of Bucay. When this leader was still young, while patrolling, he found a pretty young lass lying on the way which prompted him to extend assistance, and brought her home. After a period of time, he developed his love with the young lass and took her as his wife. In several occasions, the girl suddenly disappeared. At some instances, Bucay used to see her at the corner of his bamboo hut sitting alone with her bowed head which prompted him to approach and touch her, but always disappeared.\n\n==Geography==\nAmong the twenty-seven (27) towns of Abra, Bucay is the most centrally located, situated at {{coord|format=dms}}. It is bounded on the north by the towns of [[Tayum]] and [[Lagangilang]], on the south by [[Manabo]], on the east by [[Licuan-Baay]] and [[Sallapadan]], and on the west by [[Pe\u00f1arrubia, Abra|Pe\u00f1arrubia]], [[Bangued]] and [[Villaviciosa, Abra|Villaviciosa]].\n\nAccording to the [[Philippine Statistics Authority]], the {{PH wikidata|settlement_text}} has a land area of

He spent 1976-1977 in the UK where he was greatly inspired by the birth of the UK [[Punk rock|punk]] scene. Soon after his return to the US he was recruited into seminal DC band, The Enzymes. Heavily inspired by such diverse influences as [[Sun Ra]], [[The Art Ensemble of Chicago]], [[The Damned (band)|The Damned]] and [[Captain Beefheart]], the band existed at the fringes of what would eventually turn into [[DC Hardcore]]. After the appearance of the [[Bad Brains]] on the scene, the band became moved to a more conventionally punk and reggae repertoire. The Enzymes recorded a number of sessions but never releases any.\n\nIn 1982 he moved to Leeds to finish an undergraduate degree in Philosophy. While there he joined Dave Coleman aka Surfin Dave's surf/trash band. Originally called the Beany T's, the band was rechristened the Absent Legends. The band played a good deal in the UK and released one LP. ''In Search of a Decent Haircut'' on [[Crammed Discs]] in 1985. The Absent Legends disbanded the following year.\n\nDuring a return visit to Washington DC in the Summer of 1986, Haskett encountered longtime friend [[Henry Rollins]]. The two had been in regular contact since 1984 and often discussed musical collaboration. The serendipitous meeting turned into an improvised plan. DC bassist Bernie Wandel and Absent Legends drummer Mick Green were brought in as rhythm section and the result was the album ''[[Hot Animal Machine]]''.\n\nFrom 1987-1997, Haskett was the guitarist in the [[Rollins Band]]. The band racked up close to a thousand performances across the globe and were known for a high-intensity blend of raw energy and profound musicianship. In 1994 they were nominated for a Grammy and performed live at the ceremony. This incarnation broke up in 1998 after finishing their tour on the \"Come in and Burn\" album. Rollins kept the Rollins Band name with a new lineup of the band. The Rollins/Haskett/Cain/Gibbs lineup reformed briefly for the \"As the World Burns\" tour with Los Angeles rockers [[X (American band)|X]].\n\nPost-Rollins Band, Haskett has done multiple, mostly low-profile, projects. Throughout the 1990s he played his own instrumental compositions live with various bands. Inspired by both [[Sonny Sharrock]] and the [[Grateful Dead]], the instrumentation was usually guitar, bass, drums, drums.1995 saw his first solo release ''Language'' [https://www.discogs.com/Chris-Haskett-Language/release/1591651], a mixture of angular, dense, difficult acoustic guitar (some in duet with ex-Birthday Party guitarist [[Rowland S. Howard]]) and [[musique concrete]]. In 1997 he released the CD ''\"[http://www.discogs.com/Chris-Haskett-Brandon-Finley-Non-Fiction/release/3455018 Nonfiction]\"'' in collaboration with [[Dog Eat Dog (band)|Dog Eat Dog]] drummer, Brandon Finley. The CD was a fusion of electric jazz and the [[go-go]] music that had been the soundtrack to his DC teen years. 2002 saw the release of \"[https://www.discogs.com/Chris-Haskett-Not-Part-of-the-Solution/release/5468088]\" which showcased a more conventional approach to the electric guitar and allowed his debt to his heroes such as Zappa and Beck to show through. He reunited with Brandon Finley for 2011's ''Maybe Definitely'' [https://www.discogs.com/Chris-Haskett-Brandon-Finley-Maybe-Definitely/release/3231837]\" (a play on Jeff Beck's title \"Definitely Maybe\") and another foray into the jazz/go-go territory the two explored on \"Nonfiction\". In 2014 he released ''The Courage Born of Conflicting Terrors'' [https://www.discogs.com/Chris-Haskett-The-Courage-Born-of-Conflicting-Terrors/release/6554932]\" in collaboration with Nick Enfield and Mirna Sodre.\n\nThere are three releases slated for 2017.\n\nOther past projects included collaborations with [[Reeves Gabrels]] at the end of the 1990s, the Preaching to the Perverted Tour with [[Pigface]], the [[Cassandra Complex]], [[Foetus (band)|Foetus]] (\"Blow tour 2001\").

His customized PRS CE24's, later combined with the original appearance of the  [[Mesa Boogie]] Dual Rectifier series became a staple of modern rock. More recently, his association with Paul Reed Smith resulted in a unique 9 string custom which has the lower E-A-D strings coursed for a 12-string sound but leaves the high G-B-E strings single to allow easier bends and solos.\n\nNow resident in the Netherlands, Haskett continues to record and tour.\n\n==Notes==\n<references />\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.chrishaskett.com/ ChrisHaskett.com]\n\n{{Pigface}}\n{{Rollins Band}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Haskett, Chris}}\n[[Category:1962 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Guitarists from Washington, D.C.]]\n[[Category:American rock guitarists]]\n[[Category:American male guitarists]]\n[[Category:Pigface members]]\n[[Category:Alternative metal guitarists]]\n[[Category:Rollins Band members]]\n[[Category:20th-century American guitarists]]\n[[Category:Alumni of the University of Leeds]]\n[[Category:20th-century American male musicians]]\n[[Category:Thirsty Ear Recordings artists]]\n[[Category:Underground Inc. artists]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2013}}\n{{BLP sources|date=May 2010}}\n{{Infobox musical artist\n| name                = Chris Haskett\n| image               = \n| image_size          = \n| landscape           = <!-- yes, if wide image, otherwise leave blank -->\n| alt                 = \n| caption             = \n| background          = non_vocal_instrumentalist\n| birth_name          = \n| native_name         = \n| native_name_lang    =\n| alias               = \n| birth_date          = {{birth-date and age|1962}}\n| birth_place         = [[Washington, D.C.]]\n| origin              = \n| death_date          = <!-- {{death date and age|YYYY|MM|DD|YYYY|MM|DD}} (death date 1st) -->\n| death_place         = \n| genre               = \n| occupation          = \n| instrument          = [[Guitar]]\n| years_active        = <!-- YYYY\u2013YYYY (or \u2013present) -->\n| label               = [[Thirsty Ear Recordings|Thirsty Ear]], [[Underground Inc.]]\n| associated_acts     = [[David Bowie]], [[Foetus (band)|Foetus]], [[Pigface]], [[Rollins Band]], [[The Cassandra Complex (band)|The Cassandra Complex]], [[Tool (band)|Tool]]\n| website             = <!-- {{URL|example.com}} -->\n}}\n'''Chris Haskett''' (born 1962 in [[Washington, D.C.]]) is an American guitarist.

He spent 1976-1977 in the UK where he was greatly inspired by the birth of the UK [[Punk rock|punk]] scene. Soon after his return to the US he was recruited into seminal DC band, The Enzymes. Heavily inspired by such diverse influences as [[Sun Ra]], [[The Art Ensemble of Chicago]], [[The Damned (band)|The Damned]] and [[Captain Beefheart]], the band existed at the fringes of what would eventually turn into [[DC Hardcore]]. After the appearance of the [[Bad Brains]] on the scene, the band became moved to a more conventionally punk and reggae repertoire. The Enzymes recorded a number of sessions but never releases any.\n\nIn 1982 he moved to Leeds to finish an undergraduate degree in Philosophy. While there he joined Dave Coleman aka Surfin Dave's surf/trash band. Originally called the Beany T's, the band was rechristened the Absent Legends. The band played a good deal in the UK and released one LP. ''In Search of a Decent Haircut'' on [[Crammed Discs]] in 1985. The Absent Legends disbanded the following year.\n\nDuring a return visit to Washington DC in the Summer of 1986, Haskett encountered longtime friend [[Henry Rollins]]. The two had been in regular contact since 1984 and often discussed musical collaboration. The serendipitous meeting turned into an improvised plan. DC bassist Bernie Wandel and Absent Legends drummer Mick Green were brought in as rhythm section and the result was the album ''[[Hot Animal Machine]]''.\n\nFrom 1987-1997, Haskett was the guitarist in the [[Rollins Band]]. The band racked up close to a thousand performances across the globe and were known for a high-intensity blend of raw energy and profound musicianship. In 1994 they were nominated for a Grammy and performed live at the ceremony. This incarnation broke up in 1998 after finishing their tour on the \"Come in and Burn\" album. Rollins kept the Rollins Band name with a new lineup of the band. The Rollins/Haskett/Cain/Gibbs lineup reformed briefly for the \"As the World Burns\" tour with Los Angeles rockers [[X]].\n\nPost-Rollins Band, Haskett has done multiple, mostly low-profile, projects. Throughout the 1990s he played his own instrumental compositions live with various bands. Inspired by both [[Sonny Sharrock]] and the [[Grateful Dead]], the instrumentation was usually guitar, bass, drums, drums.1995 saw his first solo release ''Language'' [https://www.discogs.com/Chris-Haskett-Language/release/1591651], a mixture of angular, dense, difficult acoustic guitar (some in duet with ex-Birthday Party guitarist [[Rowland S. Howard]]) and [[musique concrete]]. In 1997 he released the CD ''\"[http://www.discogs.com/Chris-Haskett-Brandon-Finley-Non-Fiction/release/3455018 Nonfiction]\"'' in collaboration with [[Dog Eat Dog (band)|Dog Eat Dog]] drummer, Brandon Finley. The CD was a fusion of electric jazz and the [[go-go]] music that had been the soundtrack to his DC teen years. 2002 saw the release of \"[https://www.discogs.com/Chris-Haskett-Not-Part-of-the-Solution/release/5468088]\" which showcased a more conventional approach to the electric guitar and allowed his debt to his heroes such as Zappa and Beck to show through. He reunited with Brandon Finley for 2011's ''Maybe Definitely'' [https://www.discogs.com/Chris-Haskett-Brandon-Finley-Maybe-Definitely/release/3231837]\" (a play on Jeff Beck's title \"Definitely Maybe\") and another foray into the jazz/go-go territory the two explored on \"Nonfiction\". In 2014 he released ''The Courage Born of Conflicting Terrors'' [https://www.discogs.com/Chris-Haskett-The-Courage-Born-of-Conflicting-Terrors/release/6554932]\" in collaboration with Nick Enfield and Mirna Sodre.\n\nThere are three releases slated for 2017.\n\nOther past projects included collaborations with [[Reeves Gabrels]] at the end of the 1990s, the Preaching to the Perverted Tour with [[Pigface]], the [[Cassandra Complex]], [[Foetus (band)|Foetus]] (\"Blow tour 2001\"). He is also heard on the song \"If I'm Dreaming My Life\" on the [[David Bowie]] album ''[['hours...']]''.\n\nChris Haskett was one of the first \"indie\" guitarists to put [[Paul Reed Smith]] guitars in front of large audiences notably on the band's 1991 tour on the first [[Lollapalooza]].

It is in the north of [[Mumbai]] City and is governed by [[Mira-Bhayandar Municipal Corporation]] (MBMC). It was once Asia's largest steel utensils manufacturer. It is also a [[Bhayandar railway station|railway station]] on the Western Line of [[Mumbai Suburban Railway]]. The city is 5.6 KM away from [[Ghodbunder Fort]] and port which was once major port of India for Arabian Horse Imports. The city is the major Tourist gateway for [[Global Vipassana Pagoda]] which is 14.8 Km south of the city and to Essel world and Water Kingdom which is Asia's Biggest Amusement Park. The city has a plenty of Hotels and Temples.The city has a majority of Population of Hindus followed by Jain's and the Muslims. The city also has 2 public Library and well designed Study Hubs. Bhayander is well connected to rest of Mumbai by railways ([[Mumbai Suburban Railway]]) and Roadways. The current Mayor of Bhayander is [[Geeta Bharat Jain]].\n\nIt is 8 km north of [[Mumbai City]] and is governed by the [[Mira-Bhayandar Municipal Corporation]] (MBMC). It is also a [[Bhayandar railway station|railway station]] on the Western Line of [[Mumbai Suburban Railway]].\n\nLike all railway stations on Mumbai suburban railway, Bhayandar is divided into two parts by the rail line: East and West. The West was traditionally residential and the East was predominantly an industrial area. Another distinct distribution between East and West Bhayandar is the food. East will provide you a huge range of vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes whereas West region offers predominantly vegetarian food. Recent population growth and a flurry of construction has blurred the boundaries between Bhayandar and neighboring Mira Road on the east side of the rail tracks, turning it into a populous suburb. Government-owned [[Salt pan (evaporation)|salt pans]] and [[marshland]] in West Mira Road have restricted the southward spread of Bhayandar. There is a lot of scope for development of this land as it has the potential to house a gargantuan industrial complex.\n\nThe east Indian villages in Bhayandar are Murdha, Rai, Morva, Dongri, Uttan, Pali Chowk, Tarodi etc. They were formed by Portuguese travelers when [[Vasai]] (formerly Bassein) was a famous port. One route for \"Essel World\" is via Gorai, one of the villages close to Bhayandar. [[Gorai]] is popular for its beach and nearby Manori beach and is a popular weekend getaway for Bhayandar residents. It also is a great place for meditators who visit the Pagoda. In the 1970s Bhayandar was a village before the builders converted the fertile farming land into a concrete jungle.\n\nThe MBMC's ([[Mira-Bhayandar Municipal Corporation]]) main office is in Bhayandar (West). Departments like Property Tax, Octroi, Transportation, Health, Ambulance for Emergency, Library, Water, Education, Birth-Death Registration, Tree, Advertising Fee, Animals, Public Construction, City Development, Accounts, etc. are a part of the MBMC's suite.\n\nThe recent success of real estate in Mumbai has helped Bhayandar become one of the populated stations on the Western railway circuit. There are trains starting and ending at this station; this shows the growth of Bhayandar in the last decade. Nowadays Mira Bhayandar Municipal Transport (MBMT) bus service are provided which runs in the Mira - Bhayandar city. Mahanagar Gas (MGL) pipeline service is available. Tata Power, as well as Adani Energy, has 24-hour electric supply. Multiplex and hyper market called Maxus Mall which includes a six-screen multiplex and [[Big Bazaar]]. D-Mart and Sahakari Bhandar have made a mark in the city. Bhayandar has witnessed hike in property rates in a short time and have shown that Bhayandar is coming up as an important destination. The famous residential landmarks are Chandan Park, Jesal Park, Sarvoday Paradise, Golden Nest, Indralok in the East side.\n\nThere are many hotels in Bhayandar. One of the best is the Veg Sagar near flyover end, Bhayandar west. There are many playing grounds for children such as Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose Ground, Agarwal and Maxus cricket ground and morva bhati ground.\n\nMost recent development has been noticed with regards to hospitals having world class facilities for all. One of them being Mira-Bhayandar Institute for Reproductive Assistance (MIRA) providing fertility clinic and total woman care.\n\n==Mira Bhayander Sports Complex==\nFirst-ever sports complex in Mira Bhayander which gives sports enthusiasts a great platform to the participants to show their talent and chase their passion of sports with the help of professional coaches and live their dreams.\n==Schools==\n[[File:Bhayandar stationboard.jpg|alt=Bhayander Railway station - one of the busiest railway station in Western Suburban Railways.|thumb|Bhayandar Railway Station]]\n\n*ST.Xavier's High school (SSC)\n*Mother Mary English High School (SSC)\n*RBK International School (IGCSE)\n*Our Lady Of Nazareth High school and Jr. College (SSC)\n*Sardar Vallabhai Patel vidyalaya (SSC)\n*St. Francis High School\n*RBK Global School (CBSE) \n*Mother Teresa High school\n*D'silva High School (SSC)\n*St. Soldier Public School\n*St  Aloysius English  High School\n*Tapovan Vidhyalay CBSE School\n*S.L.
