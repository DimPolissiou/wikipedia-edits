It stars [[Robert Pattinson]] as a bank robber desperately trying to get enough money to pay for bail for his developmentally disabled brother (Benny Safdie); [[Barkhad Abdi]], [[Jennifer Jason Leigh]], and Buddy Duress co-star. The [[Good Time (soundtrack)|original soundtrack]] was composed by electronic musician [[Oneohtrix Point Never]].\n\nThe film received critical praise and was selected to compete for the [[Palme d'Or]] in the main competition section at the [[2017 Cannes Film Festival]].\n\n==Plot==\nConnie Nikas forcibly removes his developmentally disabled brother Nick from a therapy session. At the insistence of Connie, the two then rob a New York City bank for $65,000. They almost escape, but a [[dye pack]] explodes in a money bag during their getaway, causing the driver to crash. Connie and Nick flee on foot, washing the dye from their clothes in a Domino\u2019s Pizza restroom. As the two walk down the street, they are stopped by police. Nick panics, runs, and is arrested while Connie narrowly escapes.\n\nConnie attempts to secure a [[Bail|bail bond]], but needs $10,000 more to get Nick out of jail. He convinces his girlfriend, Corey, to pay with her mother's credit cards, but they learn too late that her mother has cancelled them. Connie learns that Nick has been hospitalized after a fight with an inmate, and goes to the hospital and breaks out the unconscious and bandaged Nick. Afterwards, Connie convinces a woman he meets on the bus to let them stay in her house with her 16-year-old granddaughter, Crystal. While they watch TV, the news shows photos of Connie; to distract Crystal, Connie kisses her. Hearing screams from the other room, Connie walks in and realizes the man he broke out of the hospital is not Nick, but a man recently released on parole named Ray.\n\nConnie, Ray, and Crystal drive to the [[Adventureland (New York)|Adventureland]] amusement park, where Ray had stowed a bag of cash and a [[Sprite (drink)|Sprite]] bottle containing [[LSD]] solution worth several thousand dollars before he ran from police and injured himself by jumping out of a moving taxi. Searching for the cash, Connie and Ray find the bottle of LSD but are discovered by Dash, a security guard. Ray is briefly detained by Dash until Connie ambushes him and beats Dash unconscious. As the cops arrive, Connie dons Dash's uniform and Ray pours some of the  LSD down Dash's throat to make him incoherent. Connie convinces the police that the guard was the intruder and destroys a hard drive containing security footage. Police find Crystal waiting outside and take her into custody.\n\nRay and Connie break into Dash's high-rise apartment. Ray begins drinking and questioning Connie, who in return tells Ray he is a leech on society. At Connie's insistence, Ray calls his criminal friend Caliph to buy back the LSD so they can get the bail money. When Caliph arrives, Connie demands $15,000; Caliph agrees, but gestures to Ray that he will retrieve a firearm instead. Knowing something is up, Connie flees with the acid, but is caught by police and arrested. Spotting the LSD bottle fall out of Connie's bag, Ray calls Caliph and informs him of the situation, before attempting to escape from a window and falling to his death.\n\nAfter Connie takes responsibility for his crimes, Nick joins a therapy class and begins to participate in a group activity.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Robert Pattinson]] as Constantine \"Connie\" Nikas,<ref name=\"Jul2015THR\" /> a small time bank robber, Nick's older brother and Loren\u2019s boyfriend.\n* [[Safdie brothers|Benny Safdie]] as Nickolas \"Nick\" Nikas, Connie's younger, mentally-handicapped brother.\n* [[Jennifer Jason Leigh]] as Loren, Connie's girlfriend.\n* [[Barkhad Abdi]] as Dash, a security guard working a night shift at an amusement park \n* Buddy Duress as Ray, a criminal whom Connie mistakes for his brother.\n* Taliah Lennice Webster as Crystal, a teenage girl who helps Connie.\n* [[Necro (rapper)|Necro]] as Caliph, a criminal friend of Ray.\n* Eric Paykert as Bail Bondsman.\n* Peter Verby as Peter, Nick's psychiatrist.\n\n==Production==\nOn July 9, 2015, it was announced that [[Safdie brothers|Ben and Josh Safdie]] would direct a caper film called ''Good Time'', and that Pattinson was attached to star.<ref name=Jul2015THR>{{cite news|last1=Ford|first1=Rebecca|title=Robert Pattinson to Star in Caper 'Good Time' (Exclusive)|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/robert-pattinson-star-caper-good-807597|accessdate=January 9, 2016|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=July 9, 2015}}</ref> Elara Pictures' Sebastian Bear-McClard and Oscar Boyson produced the film,<ref name=\"Jul2015THR\" /> which Pattinson described as a \"really hardcore kind of [[Queens|Queens, New York]], mentally damaged psychopath, bank robbery movie.\"<ref>{{cite news |title=Robert Pattinson Says He\u2019s Making A \"100% Improvised Movie\" & Creating Music For A Slapstick Comedy|url=http://theplaylist.net/robert-pattinson-says-hes-making-100-improvised-movie-making-music-slapstick-comedy-20170321/|access-date=March 24, 2016}}</ref>\n\n[[Principal photography]] on the film began on January 3, 2016 in [[New York City]].<ref>{{cite news|title=On the Set for 1/8/16: Robert Pattinson Starts on the Feature, \u2018Good Time\u2019 While Michael Fassbender & Marion Cotillard Wrap \u2018Assassin\u2019s Creed\u2019|url=http://www.ssninsider.com/on-the-set-for-1816-robert-pattinson-starts-on-the-feature-good-time-while-michael-fassbender-marion-cotillard-wrap-assassins-creed/|accessdate=January 9, 2016|work=SSN Insider|date=January 8, 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160109234920/http://www.ssninsider.com/on-the-set-for-1816-robert-pattinson-starts-on-the-feature-good-time-while-michael-fassbender-marion-cotillard-wrap-assassins-creed/|archivedate=January 9, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title='Good Time' Starring Robert Pattinson Open Casting Call for Lead Roles|url=http://www.projectcasting.com/casting-calls-acting-auditions/good-time-robert-pattinson-open-casting-call/|accessdate=January 9, 2016|work=Project Casting|date=December 2, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Music===\n[[Oneohtrix Point Never]] provided the film's score, which won the Soundtrack Award at the 2017 [[Cannes Film Festival]].<ref>Kim, Michelle (May 27, 2017).

It stars [[Robert Pattinson]] as a bank robber desperately trying to get enough money to pay for bail for his developmentally disabled brother (Benny Safdie); [[Barkhad Abdi]], [[Jennifer Jason Leigh]], and Buddy Duress co-star. The [[Good Time (soundtrack)|original soundtrack]] was composed by electronic musician [[Oneohtrix Point Never]].\n\nThe film received critical praise and was selected to compete for the [[Palme d'Or]] in the main competition section at the [[2017 Cannes Film Festival]].\n\n==Plot==\nConnie Nikas forcibly removes his developmentally disabled brother Nick from a therapy session. At the insistence of Connie, the two then rob a New York City bank for $65,000. They almost escape, but a [[dye pack]] explodes in a money bag during their getaway, causing the driver to crash. Connie and Nick flee on foot, washing the dye from their clothes in a Domino\u2019s Pizza restroom. As the two walk down the street, they are stopped by police. Nick panics, runs, and is arrested while Connie narrowly escapes.\n\nConnie attempts to secure a [[Bail|bail bond]], but needs $10,000 more to get Nick out of jail. He convinces his girlfriend, Corey, to pay with her mother's credit cards, but they learn too late that her mother has cancelled them. Connie learns that Nick has been hospitalized after a fight with an inmate, and goes to the hospital and breaks out the unconscious and bandaged Nick. Afterwards, Connie convinces a woman he meets on the bus to let them stay in her house with her 16-year-old granddaughter, Crystal. While they watch TV, the news shows photos of Connie; to distract Crystal, Connie kisses her. Hearing screams from the other room, Connie walks in and realizes the man he broke out of the hospital is not Nick, but a man recently released on parole named Ray.\n\nConnie, Ray, and Crystal drive to the [[Adventureland (New York)|Adventureland]] amusement park, where Ray had stowed a bag of cash and a [[Sprite (drink)|Sprite]] bottle containing [[LSD]] solution worth several thousand dollars before he ran from police and injured himself by jumping out of a moving taxi. Searching for the cash, Connie and Ray find the bottle of LSD but are discovered by Dash, a security guard. Ray is briefly detained by Dash until Connie ambushes him and beats Dash unconscious. As the cops arrive, Connie dons Dash's uniform and Ray pours some of the  LSD down Dash's throat to make him incoherent. Connie convinces the police that the guard was the intruder and destroys a hard drive containing security footage. Police find Crystal waiting outside and take her into custody.\n\nRay and Connie break into Dash's high-rise apartment. Ray begins drinking and questioning Connie, who in return tells Ray he is a leech on society. At Connie's insistence, Ray calls his criminal friend Caliph to buy back the LSD so they can get the bail money. When Caliph arrives, Connie demands $15,000; Caliph agrees, but gestures to Ray that he will retrieve a firearm instead. Knowing something is up, Connie flees with the acid, but is caught by police and arrested. Spotting the LSD bottle fall out of Connie's bag, Ray calls Caliph and informs him of the situation, before attempting to escape from a window and falling to his death.\n\nAfter Connie takes responsibility for his crimes, Nick joins a therapy class and begins to participate in a group activity.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Robert Pattinson]] as Constantine \"Connie\" Nikas,<ref name=\"Jul2015THR\" /> a small time bank robber, Nick's older brother and Loren\u2019s boyfriend.\n* [[Safdie brothers|Benny Safdie]] as Nickolas \"Nick\" Nikas, Connie's younger, mentally-handicapped brother.\n* [[Jennifer Jason Leigh]] as Loren, Connie's girlfriend.\n* [[Barkhad Abdi]] as Dash, a security guard working a night shift at an amusement park \n* Buddy Duress as Ray, a criminal whom Connie mistakes for his brother.\n* Taliah Lennice Webster as Crystal, a teenage girl who helps Connie.\n* [[Necro (rapper)|Necro]] as Caliph, a criminal friend of Ray.\n* Eric Paykert as Bail Bondsman.\n* Peter Verby as Peter, Nick's psychiatrist.\n\n==Production==\nOn July 9, 2015, it was announced that [[Safdie brothers|Ben and Josh Safdie]] would direct a caper film called ''Good Time'', and that Pattinson was attached to star.<ref name=Jul2015THR>{{cite news|last1=Ford|first1=Rebecca|title=Robert Pattinson to Star in Caper 'Good Time' (Exclusive)|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/robert-pattinson-star-caper-good-807597|accessdate=January 9, 2016|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=July 9, 2015}}</ref> Elara Pictures' Sebastian Bear-McClard and Oscar Boyson produced the film,<ref name=\"Jul2015THR\" /> which Pattinson described as a \"really hardcore kind of [[Queens|Queens, New York]], mentally damaged psychopath, bank robbery movie.\"<ref>{{cite news |title=Robert Pattinson Says He\u2019s Making A \"100% Improvised Movie\" & Creating Music For A Slapstick Comedy|url=http://theplaylist.net/robert-pattinson-says-hes-making-100-improvised-movie-making-music-slapstick-comedy-20170321/|access-date=March 24, 2016}}</ref>\n\n[[Principal photography]] on the film began on January 3, 2016 in [[New York City]].<ref>{{cite news|title=On the Set for 1/8/16: Robert Pattinson Starts on the Feature, \u2018Good Time\u2019 While Michael Fassbender & Marion Cotillard Wrap \u2018Assassin\u2019s Creed\u2019|url=http://www.ssninsider.com/on-the-set-for-1816-robert-pattinson-starts-on-the-feature-good-time-while-michael-fassbender-marion-cotillard-wrap-assassins-creed/|accessdate=January 9, 2016|work=SSN Insider|date=January 8, 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160109234920/http://www.ssninsider.com/on-the-set-for-1816-robert-pattinson-starts-on-the-feature-good-time-while-michael-fassbender-marion-cotillard-wrap-assassins-creed/|archivedate=January 9, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title='Good Time' Starring Robert Pattinson Open Casting Call for Lead Roles|url=http://www.projectcasting.com/casting-calls-acting-auditions/good-time-robert-pattinson-open-casting-call/|accessdate=January 9, 2016|work=Project Casting|date=December 2, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Music===\n[[Oneohtrix Point Never]] provided the film's score, which won the Soundtrack Award at the 2017 [[Cannes Film Festival]].<ref>Kim, Michelle (May 27, 2017).

The cycle consumes acetate (in the form of [[acetyl-CoA]]) and [[water]], reduces [[nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide|NAD<sup>+</sup>]] to NADH, and produces carbon dioxide as a waste byproduct. The NADH generated by the citric acid cycle is fed into the [[oxidative phosphorylation]] (electron transport) pathway. The net result of these two closely linked pathways is the oxidation of nutrients to produce usable chemical energy in the form of ATP.\n\nIn [[eukaryotic]] cells, the citric acid cycle occurs in the matrix of the mitochondrion. In [[prokaryotic]] cells, such as bacteria, which lack mitochondria, the citric acid cycle reaction sequence is performed in the cytosol with the proton gradient for ATP production being across the cell's surface (plasma membrane) rather than the inner membrane of the mitochondrion.

The reactions of the cycle are carried out by eight enzymes that completely oxidize acetate (a two carbon molecule), in the form of acetyl-CoA, into two molecules each of carbon dioxide and water. Through [[catabolism]] of sugars, fats, and proteins, the two-carbon organic product acetyl-CoA (a form of acetate) is produced which enters the citric acid cycle. The reactions of the cycle also convert three equivalents of [[nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide]] (NAD<sup>+</sup>) into three equivalents of reduced NAD<sup>+</sup> (NADH), one equivalent of [[flavin adenine dinucleotide]] (FAD) into one equivalent of FADH<sub>2</sub>, and one equivalent each of [[guanosine diphosphate]] (GDP) and inorganic [[phosphate]] (P<sub>i</sub>) into one equivalent of [[guanosine triphosphate]] (GTP). The NADH and FADH<sub>2</sub> generated by the citric acid cycle are, in turn, used by the [[oxidative phosphorylation]] pathway to generate energy-rich ATP.\n\nOne of the primary sources of acetyl-CoA is from the breakdown of sugars by [[glycolysis]] which yield [[pyruvic acid|pyruvate]] that in turn is decarboxylated by the [[pyruvate dehydrogenase complex]] generating acetyl-CoA according to the following reaction scheme:\n\n: [[pyruvic acid|{{underset|pyruvate|2=CH<sub>3</sub>C(=O)C(=O)O<sup>\u2212</sup>}}]] + [[Coenzyme A|HSCoA]] + [[Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide|NAD<sup>+</sup>]] \u2192 [[acetyl-CoA|{{underset|acetyl-CoA|2=CH<sub>3</sub>C(=O)SCoA}}]] + NADH + CO<sub>2</sub>\n\nThe product of this reaction, acetyl-CoA, is the starting point for the citric acid cycle. Acetyl-CoA may also be obtained from the oxidation of fatty acids. Below is a schematic outline of the cycle:\n* The [[citric acid]] cycle begins with the transfer of a two-carbon [[acetyl]] group from acetyl-CoA to the four-carbon acceptor compound (oxaloacetate) to form a six-carbon compound (citrate).\n* The citrate then goes through a series of chemical transformations, losing two [[carboxyl]] groups as CO<sub>2</sub>. The carbons lost as CO<sub>2</sub> originate from what was oxaloacetate, not directly from acetyl-CoA. The carbons donated by acetyl-CoA become part of the oxaloacetate carbon backbone after the first turn of the citric acid cycle. Loss of the acetyl-CoA-donated carbons as CO<sub>2</sub> requires several turns of the citric acid cycle. However, because of the role of the citric acid cycle in [[anabolic|anabolism]], they might not be lost, since many citric acid cycle intermediates are also used as precursors for the biosynthesis of other molecules.<ref name=\"pmid2106256\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Wolfe RR, Jahoor F | title = Recovery of labeled CO2 during the infusion of C-1- vs C-2-labeled acetate: implications for tracer studies of substrate oxidation | journal = The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition | volume = 51 | issue = 2 | pages = 248\u201352 | date = February 1990 | pmid = 2106256 | doi = 10.1093/ajcn/51.2.248 }}</ref>\n* Most of the electrons made available by the oxidative steps of the cycle are transferred to NAD<sup>+</sup>, forming NADH.

This mutation results in several important changes to the metabolism of the cell. For one thing, because there is an extra NADPH-catalyzed reduction, this can contribute to depletion of cellular stores of NADPH and also reduce levels of alpha-ketoglutarate available to the cell. In particular, the depletion of NADPH is problematic because NADPH is highly compartmentalized and cannot freely diffuse between the organelles in the cell. It is produced largely via the [[pentose phosphate pathway]] in the cytoplasm. The depletion of NADPH results in increased [[oxidative stress]] within the cell as it is a required cofactor in the production of [[Glutathione|GSH]], and this oxidative stress can result in DNA damage. There are also changes on the genetic and epigenetic level through the function of [[Histone code|histone lysine demethylases]] (KDMs) and [[Ten-Eleven Translocation 2|ten-eleven translocation]] (TET) enzymes; ordinarily TETs hydroxylate [[5-Methylcytosine|5-methylcytosines]] to prime them for demethylation. However, in the absence of alpha-ketoglutarate this cannot be done and there is hence hypermethylation of the cell's DNA, serving to promote [[Epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition|epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)]] and inhibit cellular differentiation.

The regulation of the citric acid cycle is largely determined by product inhibition and substrate availability. If the cycle were permitted to run unchecked, large amounts of metabolic energy could be wasted in overproduction of reduced coenzyme such as NADH and ATP. The major eventual substrate of the cycle is ADP which gets converted to ATP. A reduced amount of ADP causes accumulation of precursor NADH which in turn can inhibit a number of enzymes. NADH, a product of all dehydrogenases in the citric acid cycle with the exception of [[succinate dehydrogenase]], inhibits [[pyruvate dehydrogenase]], [[isocitrate dehydrogenase]], [[Alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase|\u03b1-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase]], and also [[citrate synthase]]. [[Acetyl-coA]] inhibits [[pyruvate dehydrogenase]], while [[succinyl-CoA]] inhibits alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase and [[citrate synthase]]. When tested in vitro with TCA enzymes, '''ATP''' inhibits [[citrate synthase]] and [[Alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase|\u03b1-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase]]; however, ATP levels do not change more than 10% in vivo between rest and vigorous exercise. There is no known [[allosteric]] mechanism that can account for large changes in reaction rate from an [[allosteric]] effector whose concentration changes less than 10%.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book |vauthors=Voet D, Voet JG | year = 2004 | title = Biochemistry | edition = 3rd | publisher = John Wiley & Sons, Inc. | location = New York | page = 615}}</ref>\n\n'''Citrate''' is used for feedback inhibition, as it inhibits [[phosphofructokinase]], an enzyme involved in [[glycolysis]] that catalyses formation of [[fructose 1,6-bisphosphate]], a precursor of pyruvate.

Recent work has demonstrated an important link between intermediates of the citric acid cycle and the regulation of [[hypoxia-inducible factors]] ([[HIF1A|HIF]]). HIF plays a role in the regulation of oxygen homeostasis, and is a transcription factor that targets angiogenesis, vascular remodeling, glucose utilization, iron transport and apoptosis. HIF is synthesized constitutively, and hydroxylation of at least one of two critical proline residues mediates their interaction with the von Hippel Lindau [[E3 ubiquitin ligase]] complex, which targets them for rapid degradation. This reaction is catalysed by [[prolyl hydroxylase|prolyl 4-hydroxylases]].

Most of these reactions add intermediates to the citric acid cycle, and are therefore known as [[anaplerotic reactions]], from the Greek meaning to \"fill up\". These increase the amount of acetyl CoA that the cycle is able to carry, increasing the mitochondrion's capability to carry out respiration if this is otherwise a limiting factor. Processes that remove intermediates from the cycle are termed \"cataplerotic\" reactions.\n\nIn this section and in the next, the citric acid cycle intermediates are indicated in ''italics'' to distinguish them from other substrates and end-products.\n\n[[Pyruvate]] molecules produced by [[glycolysis]] are [[active transport|actively transported]] across the inner [[Mitochondrion|mitochondrial]] membrane, and into the matrix.

Adding more of any of these intermediates to the mitochondrion therefore means that that additional amount is retained within the cycle, increasing all the other intermediates as one is converted into the other. Hence the addition of any one of them to the cycle has an anaplerotic effect, and its removal has a cataplerotic effect. These anaplerotic and cataplerotic reactions will, during the course of the cycle, increase or decrease the amount of ''oxaloacetate'' available to combine with ''acetyl-CoA'' to form ''citric acid''. This in turn increases or decreases the rate of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] production by the mitochondrion, and thus the availability of ATP to the cell.<ref name=stryer />\n\n''Acetyl-CoA'', on the other hand, derived from pyruvate oxidation, or from the [[beta-oxidation]] of [[fatty acids]], is the only fuel to enter the citric acid cycle.

The reactions of the cycle are carried out by eight enzymes that completely oxidize acetate (a two carbon molecule), in the form of acetyl-CoA, into two molecules each of carbon dioxide and water. Through [[catabolism]] of sugars, fats, and proteins, the two-carbon organic product acetyl-CoA (a form of acetate) is produced which enters the citric acid cycle. The reactions of the cycle also convert three equivalents of [[nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide]] (NAD<sup>+</sup>) into three equivalents of reduced NAD<sup>+</sup> (NADH), one equivalent of [[flavin adenine dinucleotide]] (FAD) into one equivalent of FADH<sub>2</sub>, and one equivalent each of [[guanosine diphosphate]] (GDP) and inorganic [[phosphate]] (P<sub>i</sub>) into one equivalent of [[guanosine triphosphate]] (GTP). The NADH and FADH<sub>2</sub> generated by the citric acid cycle are, in turn, used by the [[oxidative phosphorylation]] pathway to generate energy-rich ATP.\n\nOne of the primary sources of acetyl-CoA is from the breakdown of sugars by [[glycolysis]] which yield [[pyruvic acid|pyruvate]] that in turn is decarboxylated by the [[pyruvate dehydrogenase complex]] generating acetyl-CoA according to the following reaction scheme:\n\n: [[pyruvic acid|{{underset|pyruvate|2=CH<sub>3</sub>C(=O)C(=O)O<sup>\u2212</sup>}}]] + [[Coenzyme A|HSCoA]] + [[Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide|NAD<sup>+</sup>]] \u2192 [[acetyl-CoA|{{underset|acetyl-CoA|2=CH<sub>3</sub>C(=O)SCoA}}]] + NADH + CO<sub>2</sub>\n\nThe product of this reaction, acetyl-CoA, is the starting point for the citric acid cycle. Acetyl-CoA may also be obtained from the oxidation of fatty acids. Below is a schematic outline of the cycle:\n* The [[citric acid]] cycle begins with the transfer of a two-carbon [[acetyl]] group from acetyl-CoA to the four-carbon acceptor compound (oxaloacetate) to form a six-carbon compound (citrate).\n* The citrate then goes through a series of chemical transformations, losing two [[carboxyl]] groups as CO<sub>2</sub>. The carbons lost as CO<sub>2</sub> originate from what was oxaloacetate, not directly from acetyl-CoA. The carbons donated by acetyl-CoA become part of the oxaloacetate carbon backbone after the first turn of the citric acid cycle. Loss of the acetyl-CoA-donated carbons as CO<sub>2</sub> requires several turns of the citric acid cycle. However, because of the role of the citric acid cycle in [[anabolic|anabolism]], they might not be lost, since many citric acid cycle intermediates are also used as precursors for the biosynthesis of other molecules.<ref name=\"pmid2106256\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Wolfe RR, Jahoor F | title = Recovery of labeled CO2 during the infusion of C-1- vs C-2-labeled acetate: implications for tracer studies of substrate oxidation | journal = The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition | volume = 51 | issue = 2 | pages = 248\u201352 | date = February 1990 | pmid = 2106256 | doi = 10.1093/ajcn/51.2.248 }}</ref>\n* Most of the electrons made available by the oxidative steps of the cycle are transferred to NAD<sup>+</sup>, forming NADH.

This mutation results in several important changes to the metabolism of the cell. For one thing, because there is an extra NADPH-catalyzed reduction, this can contribute to depletion of cellular stores of NADPH and also reduce levels of alpha-ketoglutarate available to the cell. In particular, the depletion of NADPH is problematic because NADPH is highly compartmentalized and cannot freely diffuse between the organelles in the cell. It is produced largely via the [[pentose phosphate pathway]] in the cytoplasm. The depletion of NADPH results in increased [[oxidative stress]] within the cell as it is a required cofactor in the production of [[Glutathione|GSH]], and this oxidative stress can result in DNA damage. There are also changes on the genetic and epigenetic level through the function of [[Histone code|histone lysine demethylases]] (KDMs) and [[Ten-Eleven Translocation 2|ten-eleven translocation]] (TET) enzymes; ordinarily TETs hydroxylate [[5-Methylcytosine|5-methylcytosines]] to prime them for demethylation. However, in the absence of alpha-ketoglutarate this cannot be done and there is hence hypermethylation of the cell's DNA, serving to promote [[Epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition|epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)]] and inhibit cellular differentiation.

The regulation of the citric acid cycle is largely determined by product inhibition and substrate availability. If the cycle were permitted to run unchecked, large amounts of metabolic energy could be wasted in overproduction of reduced coenzyme such as NADH and ATP. The major eventual substrate of the cycle is ADP which gets converted to ATP. A reduced amount of ADP causes accumulation of precursor NADH which in turn can inhibit a number of enzymes. NADH, a product of all dehydrogenases in the citric acid cycle with the exception of [[succinate dehydrogenase]], inhibits [[pyruvate dehydrogenase]], [[isocitrate dehydrogenase]], [[Alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase|\u03b1-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase]], and also [[citrate synthase]]. [[Acetyl-coA]] inhibits [[pyruvate dehydrogenase]], while [[succinyl-CoA]] inhibits alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase and [[citrate synthase]]. When tested in vitro with TCA enzymes, '''ATP''' inhibits [[citrate synthase]] and [[Alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase|\u03b1-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase]]; however, ATP levels do not change more than 10% in vivo between rest and vigorous exercise. There is no known [[allosteric]] mechanism that can account for large changes in reaction rate from an [[allosteric]] effector whose concentration changes less than 10%.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book |vauthors=Voet D, Voet JG | year = 2004 | title = Biochemistry | edition = 3rd | publisher = John Wiley & Sons, Inc. | location = New York | page = 615}}</ref>\n\n'''Citrate''' is used for feedback inhibition, as it inhibits [[phosphofructokinase]], an enzyme involved in [[glycolysis]] that catalyses formation of [[fructose 1,6-bisphosphate]], a precursor of pyruvate.

Recent work has demonstrated an important link between intermediates of the citric acid cycle and the regulation of [[hypoxia-inducible factors]] ([[HIF1A|HIF]]). HIF plays a role in the regulation of oxygen homeostasis, and is a transcription factor that targets angiogenesis, vascular remodeling, glucose utilization, iron transport and apoptosis. HIF is synthesized constitutively, and hydroxylation of at least one of two critical proline residues mediates their interaction with the von Hippel Lindau [[E3 ubiquitin ligase]] complex, which targets them for rapid degradation. This reaction is catalysed by [[prolyl hydroxylase|prolyl 4-hydroxylases]]. Fumarate and succinate have been identified as potent inhibitors of prolyl hydroxylases, thus leading to the stabilisation of HIF.<ref name=\"pmid17182618\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Koivunen P, Hirsil\u00e4 M, Remes AM, Hassinen IE, Kivirikko KI, Myllyharju J | title = Inhibition of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) hydroxylases by citric acid cycle intermediates: possible links between cell metabolism and stabilization of HIF | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 282 | issue = 7 | pages = 4524\u201332 | date = February 2007 | pmid = 17182618 | doi = 10.1074/jbc.M610415200 }}</ref>\n\n== Major metabolic pathways converging on the citric acid cycle ==\nSeveral [[catabolic]] pathways converge on the citric acid cycle. Most of these reactions add intermediates to the citric acid cycle, and are therefore known as [[anaplerotic reactions]], from the Greek meaning to \"fill up\". These increase the amount of acetyl CoA that the cycle is able to carry, increasing the mitochondrion's capability to carry out respiration if this is otherwise a limiting factor. Processes that remove intermediates from the cycle are termed \"cataplerotic\" reactions.\n\nIn this section and in the next, the citric acid cycle intermediates are indicated in ''italics'' to distinguish them from other substrates and end-products.\n\n[[Pyruvate]] molecules produced by [[glycolysis]] are [[active transport|actively transported]] across the inner [[Mitochondrion|mitochondrial]] membrane, and into the matrix. Here they can be [[Redox|oxidized]] and combined with [[coenzyme A]] to form CO<sub>2</sub>, ''[[acetyl-CoA]]'', and [[NADH]], as in the normal cycle.<ref name=Voet>{{cite book |last=Voet |first=Donald |author2=Judith G.

Adding more of any of these intermediates to the mitochondrion therefore means that that additional amount is retained within the cycle, increasing all the other intermediates as one is converted into the other. Hence the addition of any one of them to the cycle has an anaplerotic effect, and its removal has a cataplerotic effect. These anaplerotic and cataplerotic reactions will, during the course of the cycle, increase or decrease the amount of ''oxaloacetate'' available to combine with ''acetyl-CoA'' to form ''citric acid''. This in turn increases or decreases the rate of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] production by the mitochondrion, and thus the availability of ATP to the cell.<ref name=stryer />\n\n''Acetyl-CoA'', on the other hand, derived from pyruvate oxidation, or from the [[beta-oxidation]] of [[fatty acids]], is the only fuel to enter the citric acid cycle. With each turn of the cycle one molecule of ''acetyl-CoA'' is consumed for every molecule of ''oxaloacetate'' present in the mitochondrial matrix, and is never regenerated. It is the oxidation of the acetate portion of ''acetyl-CoA'' that produces CO<sub>2</sub> and water, with the energy of O<sub>2</sub> <ref name=\"Schmidt-Rohr 20\"> Schmidt-Rohr, K.

Acyl-CoA is oxidized to trans-Enoyl-CoA while FAD is reduced to FADH<sub>2</sub>, which is similar to the oxidation of succinate to fumarate. Following, trans-Enoyl-CoA is hydrated across the double bond to beta-hydroxyacyl-CoA, just like fumarate is hydrated to malate. Lastly, beta-hydroxyacyl-CoA is oxidized to beta-ketoacyl-CoA while NAD+ is reduced to NADH, which follows the same process as the oxidation of malate to oxaloacetate.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Biochemistry |last=Garrett |first=Reginald H. |date=2013 |publisher=Brooks/Cole, Cengage Learning |last2=Grisham |first2=Charles M. |isbn=9781133106296 |edition=5th |location=Belmont, CA |pages=623\u2013625, 771\u2013773 |oclc=777722371}}</ref>\n\nIn the liver, the carboxylation of [[cytosol]]ic pyruvate into intra-mitochondrial ''oxaloacetate'' is an early step in the [[gluconeogenesis|gluconeogenic]] pathway which converts [[lactic acid|lactate]] and de-aminated [[alanine]] into glucose,<ref name=Voet /><ref name=stryer /> under the influence of high levels of [[glucagon]] and/or [[epinephrine]] in the blood.<ref name=stryer /> Here the addition of ''oxaloacetate'' to the mitochondrion does not have a net anaplerotic effect, as another citric acid cycle intermediate (''malate'') is immediately removed from the mitochondrion to be converted into cytosolic oxaloacetate, which is ultimately converted into glucose, in a process that is almost the reverse of [[glycolysis]].<ref name=stryer />\n\nIn [[protein catabolism]], [[protein]]s are broken down by [[protease]]s into their constituent amino acids.

These are the so-called \"glucogenic\" amino acids.
