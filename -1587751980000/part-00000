It is isolated from road traffic, but shared with other trains; after operating hours, the section of track south of Walkley Yard has been infrequently used by [[Ottawa Central Railway|Ottawa Central]] for freight service to the [[National Research Council of Canada|National Research Council]].\n\nBetween 2013 and 2015, there was an upgrade of the line, including the complete replacement of the train fleet, in order to cut wait times during peak periods from 15 minutes to 12 minutes and eventually to 8\u201310 minutes.

The line is operated by the City of Ottawa under the official name \"Capital Railway\", which appears on the trains along with their regular logo.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.otc-cta.gc.ca/eng/ruling/283-r-2007|title=Decision No. 283-R-2007|date=2007-06-06|website=www.otc-cta.gc.ca|access-date=2019-03-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190405201205/https://www.otc-cta.gc.ca/eng/ruling/283-r-2007|archive-date=April 5, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Pilot project===\n<!--Other articles link to this section name. Thus, if you change this name, you must code an {{anchor}} for the old section name to avoid broken links.-->\nThe Trillium Line was introduced on October 15, 2001, as a pilot project to provide an alternative to the [[Transitway (Ottawa)|Transitway]] [[bus rapid transit]] on which Ottawa had long depended exclusively for its high-grade transit service. The single-track line operated with five stations and a single passing loop at [[Carleton station]].\n\nAs a pilot project, the Trillium Line system was built at the cost of {{CAD|21{{nbsp}}million|link=yes}}, relatively little compared with the hundreds of millions of dollars usually required to build a new transit line. It runs on an existing [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] track (Ellwood and [[Prescott, Ontario|Prescott]] subdivisions<ref name=\"NiagaraRails\">{{cite web|url=http://www.niagararails.com/cgi-bin/img.cgi?/maps/otawatrm.gif|title=Ottawa Railways|last=Duncan|first=Paul|work=NiagaraRails.com|format=GIF|accessdate=2009-01-12}}</ref>), so the only construction work necessary was to build the stations themselves and the passing tracks necessary to allow trains to operate in both directions.\n\nFrom 2001 until 2015,<ref name=\"2015-Launch\" /> the system used three diesel-powered [[Bombardier Transportation|Bombardier]] [[Talent (train)|Talent BR643]] [[low-floor]] [[diesel multiple unit]] trains. It was, however, described as \"light rail\", partly because plans called for it to be extended into Ottawa\u2019s downtown as a tramway-like service, and partly because the Talent vehicles, though designed for mainline railways in Europe, are much smaller and lighter than most mainline trains in North America, and do not meet the [[Association of American Railroads#Functions|Association of American Railroads']] standards for [[Buff strength|crash strength]]. Ottawa is also authorized to run trains with only a single operator and no other crew, something rare on mainline railways in North America.\n\nUntil late 2014, the official name of the diesel-powered, north\u2013south line was \"O-Train\". After construction started on a second, east\u2013west light rail line (the [[Confederation Line]]), the O-Train name was applied to the entire system, and the north\u2013south line was renamed the \"Trillium Line\".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/o-train-name-approved-for-ottawa-light-rail-system-1.2769049|title=O-Train name approved for Ottawa light rail system|date=September 17, 2014|newspaper=[[CBC News Network]]|accessdate=2014-12-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141007113656/http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/o-train-name-approved-for-ottawa-light-rail-system-1.2769049|archive-date=October 7, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n====Original service====\n[[File:Carletonstation.jpg|thumb|left|[[Carleton station|Carleton]] is the only station with two platforms. Note retractable platform extenders at solid yellow markings.]]\n[[File:OttawaO-TrainInterior.jpg|thumb|left|Interior of the Bombardier Talent carriages (2001\u20132015)]]\nTicketing on the Trillium Line originally worked entirely on a proof-of-payment basis; there were no ticket barriers or [[turnstile]]s, and the driver did not check fares. Occasionally, OC Transpo Special Constables or other employees prompted passengers for proof-of-payment. Tickets can be purchased from a vending machine on the platform, and certain bus passes are also valid for the Trillium Line. Trillium Line tickets were exchanged for bus transfers upon boarding a bus. Although bus transfers can be used to board the O-Train, prepaid bus tickets cannot.\n\nThe European trains are narrower than the North American standard. In order to enable night-time use of the line by standard-width freight services, retractable platform extenders are mounted at each station (other than Bayview which is constructed on its own private rail spur). Passengers gain access to the Trillium Line on these extenders. If the line is used for freight, the extenders are retracted allowing a wider train to pass through the station. The extender interface with the train has been refined over time, and cyclists and wheelchair users now have no trouble accessing the train.\n\nThe service frequency of a train every fifteen minutes made it possible to run the line with a fleet of just three trains (of which only two were in service at any given time) and a single track, apart from passing sidings at [[Carleton station]].\n\nThe Trillium Line hit the 1-millionth rider mark on May 29, 2002, the 5-millionth mark on January 21, 2005, and the 10-millionth in late 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.octranspo.com/routes/odometer_1_mil_km|title=OC Transpo - Odometer passes 1 Millionth KM!|date=|publisher=octranspo.com|accessdate=2010-08-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190119121137/http://www.octranspo.com/routes/odometer_1_mil_km|archive-date=January 19, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> In mid-2011, the Trillium Line carried an average of approximately 12,000 riders each day.<ref name=\"24may\" />\n\n====Awards====\nIn June 2002, the O-Train Light Rail Transit project received the [[Canadian Urban Transit Association]]\u2019s Corporate Innovation Award.<ref name=\"O-Train Awards\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tc.gc.ca/eng/programs/environment-utsp-otrainlightrailproject-973.htm|title=O-Train Light Rail Project|accessdate=2011-04-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110123114358/http://www.tc.gc.ca/eng/programs/environment-utsp-otrainlightrailproject-973.htm|archive-date=January 23, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nOn January 16, 2003, the Ontario chapter of the [[American Public Works Association]] (APWA) presented the City of Ottawa, [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] and [[Morrison Hershfield]] with the APWA Public Works Project of the Year award in the transportation category.

The Trillium Line's route was determined by existing railway tracks, rather than the parts of the city that needed public transport, which would have required new tracks to be laid. [[Carleton University]] students, however, benefited from the Trillium Line pilot project, as it connected the university to the busy [[Transitway (Ottawa)|Ottawa Transitway]] system.\n\nThe other criticism is that there is very low ridership of the trains compared to some very crowded bus lines such as the 90\u201399 series routes. One fully loaded Trillium Line train carries 285 passengers compared to 131 passengers for an [[articulated bus]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.octranspo.com/contacts/press_releases/2001/010405_LowFloorBuses.htm|title= OC Transpo adds new low-floor articulated buses to its fleet|publisher= OC Transpo|date= 2001-04-05|accessdate= 2009-01-12| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070929105859/http://www.octranspo.com/contacts/press_releases/2001/010405_LowFloorBuses.htm| archivedate = September 29, 2007}}</ref> The O-Train schedule is limited by track capacity.\n\n====Early extension plans====\n{{main|O-Train#Early extension plans}}\nIn July 2006, Ottawa City Council approved a north\u2013south light rail expansion project. The project would have terminated diesel light rail service on the Trillium Line so as to reuse its right-of-way for a double-track, electric light rail line that would have extended west from the [[University of Ottawa]] to [[Bayview station (OC Transpo)|Bayview]] then south to [[Leitrim, Ontario|Leitrim]] and then west to [[Barrhaven]]. However, in December 2006, Ottawa City Council cancelled this project, thus leaving the diesel-powered Trillium Line unchanged.\n\n===Service improvements===\nOn May 18, 2011, OC Transpo approved a $200,000 study to expand the Trillium Line. The $59-million proposal included the purchase of six new trainsets and track improvements that would increase headways to eight minutes from fifteen.<ref name=\"24may\">{{cite web | url=http://www.railwaygazette.com/index.php?id=44&no_cache=1&tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=13296&cHash=3d62410f22 | title=Ottawa O-Train extension proposed | publisher=Railway Gazette International | date=24 May 2011 | accessdate=2011-05-28 | archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5z1jhrY0i?url=http://www.railwaygazette.com/index.php?id=44 | archivedate=May 28, 2011 | url-status=live }}</ref> The project would finally cost $60.3{{Nbsp}}million.<ref name=\"Improve-Service-2015\">{{cite web |url=http://ottawa.ca/en/news/new-trains-improve-o-train-trillium-line-service |title=New Trains improve O-Train Trillium Line service |publisher=[[City of Ottawa]] |date=March 2, 2015 |accessdate=2015-07-31}}</ref>\n\nIn mid-2013, service on the Trillium Line was suspended for four months to implement service and track improvements such as new station platforms and two new passing tracks (near Brookfield and Gladstone).<ref name=\"Improve-Service-2015\"/><ref name=\"2013-Upgrade\">{{cite news |url=http://ottawa.ctvnews.ca/ottawa-s-o-train-back-on-track-1.1438643 |last=Hua |first=John |title=Ottawa's O-Train back on track |publisher=Bell Media |website=CTVNews.ca |date=September 3, 2013 |accessdate=2015-07-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130906075120/http://ottawa.ctvnews.ca/ottawa-s-o-train-back-on-track-1.1438643 |archive-date=September 6, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref> Upgrades were also made to the signal system, train controls, stations, tracks and train yard.

It is isolated from road traffic, but shared with other trains; after operating hours, the section of track south of Walkley Yard has been infrequently used by [[Ottawa Central Railway|Ottawa Central]] for freight service to the [[National Research Council of Canada|National Research Council]].\n\nBetween 2013 and 2015, there was an upgrade of the line, including the complete replacement of the train fleet, in order to cut wait times during peak periods from 15 minutes to 12 minutes and eventually to 8\u201310 minutes. The upgrade was also a precursor to extending the line southwards by four stations.<ref name=\"Improve-Service-2015\" />\n\nIn 2022, a {{convert|16|km|adj=on}} extension and upgrade to the existing line is expected to be completed, adding eight new stations and a connection to [[Ottawa Macdonald\u2013Cartier International Airport|Macdonald\u2013Cartier International Airport]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.stage2lrt.ca/where/south/|title=Trillium Line South|last=|first=|date=|website=Stage 2 Ottawa|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191109044015/https://www.stage2lrt.ca/where/south/|archive-date=November 8, 2019|access-date=November 8, 2019}}</ref> The Trillium Line will be shutdown for two years beginning in May 2020 to accommodate construction of the extension.<ref name=\"CBC-shutdown-2019\">{{cite web |last1=Ramlakhan |first1=Krystalle |title=Students rail against longer-than-expected O-Train shutdown |url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/frustrated-students-carleton-o-train-ottawa-lrt-delays-longer-shut-down-1.5031347 |website=CBC News |accessdate=28 October 2019 |date=February 24, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190930001943/https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/frustrated-students-carleton-o-train-ottawa-lrt-delays-longer-shut-down-1.5031347 |archive-date=September 30, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=\"OS-construction-2019\">{{cite web |title=Here's what's happening for Stage 2 LRT construction right now |url=https://ottawastart.com/heres-whats-happening-for-stage-2-lrt-construction-right-now/ |accessdate=October 28, 2019 |date=October 24, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191028124110/https://ottawastart.com/heres-whats-happening-for-stage-2-lrt-construction-right-now/ |archive-date=October 28, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n== Service ==\nThe Trillium Line operates on a [[Single-track railway|single-track]] rail line with five stations and three [[passing loop]]s. With the exception of {{stn|Carleton}}, all stations have only a single platform.\n\nIt is legally considered a federally-regulated mainline railway despite being used for local public transport purposes, and the service it provides is, in terms of its route and service frequency, more like that of an urban railway than a [[rapid transit|metro]] or [[tram]]way. The line is operated by the City of Ottawa under the official name \"Capital Railway\", which appears on the trains along with their regular logo.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.otc-cta.gc.ca/eng/ruling/283-r-2007|title=Decision No. 283-R-2007|date=2007-06-06|website=www.otc-cta.gc.ca|access-date=2019-03-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190405201205/https://www.otc-cta.gc.ca/eng/ruling/283-r-2007|archive-date=April 5, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Pilot project===\n<!--Other articles link to this section name. Thus, if you change this name, you must code an {{anchor}} for the old section name to avoid broken links.-->\nThe Trillium Line was introduced on October 15, 2001, as a pilot project to provide an alternative to the [[Transitway (Ottawa)|Transitway]] [[bus rapid transit]] on which Ottawa had long depended exclusively for its high-grade transit service. The single-track line operated with five stations and a single passing loop at [[Carleton station]].\n\nAs a pilot project, the Trillium Line system was built at the cost of {{CAD|21{{nbsp}}million|link=yes}}, relatively little compared with the hundreds of millions of dollars usually required to build a new transit line. It runs on an existing [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] track (Ellwood and [[Prescott, Ontario|Prescott]] subdivisions<ref name=\"NiagaraRails\">{{cite web|url=http://www.niagararails.com/cgi-bin/img.cgi?/maps/otawatrm.gif|title=Ottawa Railways|last=Duncan|first=Paul|work=NiagaraRails.com|format=GIF|accessdate=2009-01-12}}</ref>), so the only construction work necessary was to build the stations themselves and the passing tracks necessary to allow trains to operate in both directions.\n\nFrom 2001 until 2015,<ref name=\"2015-Launch\" /> the system used three diesel-powered [[Bombardier Transportation|Bombardier]] [[Talent (train)|Talent BR643]] [[low-floor]] [[diesel multiple unit]] trains. It was, however, described as \"light rail\", partly because plans called for it to be extended into Ottawa\u2019s downtown as a tramway-like service, and partly because the Talent vehicles, though designed for mainline railways in Europe, are much smaller and lighter than most mainline trains in North America, and do not meet the [[Association of American Railroads#Functions|Association of American Railroads']] standards for [[Buff strength|crash strength]]. Ottawa is also authorized to run trains with only a single operator and no other crew, something rare on mainline railways in North America.\n\nUntil late 2014, the official name of the diesel-powered, north\u2013south line was \"O-Train\". After construction started on a second, east\u2013west light rail line (the [[Confederation Line]]), the O-Train name was applied to the entire system, and the north\u2013south line was renamed the \"Trillium Line\".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/o-train-name-approved-for-ottawa-light-rail-system-1.2769049|title=O-Train name approved for Ottawa light rail system|date=September 17, 2014|newspaper=[[CBC News Network]]|accessdate=2014-12-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141007113656/http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/o-train-name-approved-for-ottawa-light-rail-system-1.2769049|archive-date=October 7, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n====Original service====\n[[File:Carletonstation.jpg|thumb|left|[[Carleton station|Carleton]] is the only station with two platforms. Note retractable platform extenders at solid yellow markings.]]\n[[File:OttawaO-TrainInterior.jpg|thumb|left|Interior of the Bombardier Talent carriages (2001\u20132015)]]\nTicketing on the Trillium Line originally worked entirely on a proof-of-payment basis; there were no ticket barriers or [[turnstile]]s, and the driver did not check fares. Occasionally, OC Transpo Special Constables or other employees prompted passengers for proof-of-payment. Tickets can be purchased from a vending machine on the platform, and certain bus passes are also valid for the Trillium Line. Trillium Line tickets were exchanged for bus transfers upon boarding a bus. Although bus transfers can be used to board the O-Train, prepaid bus tickets cannot.\n\nThe European trains are narrower than the North American standard. In order to enable night-time use of the line by standard-width freight services, retractable platform extenders are mounted at each station (other than Bayview which is constructed on its own private rail spur). Passengers gain access to the Trillium Line on these extenders. If the line is used for freight, the extenders are retracted allowing a wider train to pass through the station. The extender interface with the train has been refined over time, and cyclists and wheelchair users now have no trouble accessing the train.\n\nThe service frequency of a train every fifteen minutes made it possible to run the line with a fleet of just three trains (of which only two were in service at any given time) and a single track, apart from passing sidings at [[Carleton station]].\n\nThe Trillium Line hit the 1-millionth rider mark on May 29, 2002, the 5-millionth mark on January 21, 2005, and the 10-millionth in late 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.octranspo.com/routes/odometer_1_mil_km|title=OC Transpo - Odometer passes 1 Millionth KM!|date=|publisher=octranspo.com|accessdate=2010-08-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190119121137/http://www.octranspo.com/routes/odometer_1_mil_km|archive-date=January 19, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> In mid-2011, the Trillium Line carried an average of approximately 12,000 riders each day.<ref name=\"24may\" />\n\n====Awards====\nIn June 2002, the O-Train Light Rail Transit project received the [[Canadian Urban Transit Association]]\u2019s Corporate Innovation Award.<ref name=\"O-Train Awards\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tc.gc.ca/eng/programs/environment-utsp-otrainlightrailproject-973.htm|title=O-Train Light Rail Project|accessdate=2011-04-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110123114358/http://www.tc.gc.ca/eng/programs/environment-utsp-otrainlightrailproject-973.htm|archive-date=January 23, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nOn January 16, 2003, the Ontario chapter of the [[American Public Works Association]] (APWA) presented the City of Ottawa, [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] and [[Morrison Hershfield]] with the APWA Public Works Project of the Year award in the transportation category.

The Trillium Line's route was determined by existing railway tracks, rather than the parts of the city that needed public transport, which would have required new tracks to be laid. [[Carleton University]] students, however, benefited from the Trillium Line pilot project, as it connected the university to the busy [[Transitway (Ottawa)|Ottawa Transitway]] system.\n\nThe other criticism is that there is very low ridership of the trains compared to some very crowded bus lines such as the 90\u201399 series routes. One fully loaded Trillium Line train carries 285 passengers compared to 131 passengers for an [[articulated bus]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.octranspo.com/contacts/press_releases/2001/010405_LowFloorBuses.htm|title= OC Transpo adds new low-floor articulated buses to its fleet|publisher= OC Transpo|date= 2001-04-05|accessdate= 2009-01-12| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070929105859/http://www.octranspo.com/contacts/press_releases/2001/010405_LowFloorBuses.htm| archivedate = September 29, 2007}}</ref> The O-Train schedule is limited by track capacity.\n\n====Early extension plans====\n{{main|O-Train#Early extension plans}}\nIn July 2006, Ottawa City Council approved a north\u2013south light rail expansion project. The project would have terminated diesel light rail service on the Trillium Line so as to reuse its right-of-way for a double-track, electric light rail line that would have extended west from the [[University of Ottawa]] to [[Bayview station (OC Transpo)|Bayview]] then south to [[Leitrim, Ontario|Leitrim]] and then west to [[Barrhaven]]. However, in December 2006, Ottawa City Council cancelled this project, thus leaving the diesel-powered Trillium Line unchanged.\n\n===Service improvements===\nOn May 18, 2011, OC Transpo approved a $200,000 study to expand the Trillium Line.

Five of these inlets are natural and have mobility characteristics.  The sixth is an artificial inlet that was opened with the purpose of allowing easier access to the port of [[Faro, Portugal|Faro]].\n\nPresently the main inlet of the system is the Faro-Olh\u00e3o inlet, which was artificially opened. The process started in 1927 but only in 1952 were the engineering works completed and it assumed the present configuration.\n\nWithin the Ria Formosa system, different and sometimes antagonistic uses may be found. Part of the system is a Natural Park but Ria Formosa also plays an important role in the region's economy.

Five of these inlets are natural and have mobility characteristics.  The sixth is an artificial inlet that was opened with the purpose of allowing easier access to the port of [[Faro, Portugal|Faro]].\n\nPresently the main inlet of the system is the Faro-Olh\u00e3o inlet, which was artificially opened. The process started in 1927 but only in 1952 were the engineering works completed and it assumed the present configuration.\n\nWithin the Ria Formosa system, different and sometimes antagonistic uses may be found. Part of the system is a Natural Park but Ria Formosa also plays an important role in the region's economy.  Beyond the tourist use the system also supports other economic activities like seafood farms (including [[grooved carpet shell]] harvesting) and the port of Faro.\n\nThe Ria Formosa is also a designated [[Conservation areas of Portugal|Natural Park]] of over 170 km\u00b2 and a stopping place for hundreds of different birds during the spring and autumn migratory periods.\n\nThe most important cities near the Ria Formosa are [[Tavira Municipality|Tavira]], [[Faro, Portugal|Faro]] and [[Olh\u00e3o]].\n\nThere are also some towns in this area, whose names are: [[Fuzeta]] (which belongs to the municipality of [[Olh\u00e3o]]), [[Santa Luzia (Tavira)|Santa Luzia]], [[Cabanas de Tavira]] (these last two belonging to [[Tavira Municipality|Tavira]]) and [[Cacela Velha]] (which belongs to [[Vila Real de Santo Ant\u00f3nio Municipality|Vila Real de Santo Ant\u00f3nio]]).\n\nSeveral buses run from Tavira to Cabanas and back each weekday, but there are no buses on Saturday afternoons nor all day Sundays and Holidays, even in summer.

This is a substantially higher average than the surrounding areas, which have ratings varying from two to four. As a consequence of being mostly privately owned, the town is very opulently designed. The town and marina have an extensive variety of activities which are usually on Tuesdays, Thursdays and at weekends, including touring the local caves along the coastline (which are nearer to [[Albufeira]] than they are to Vilamoura). This cave tour is usually done on tour boats. The area also has two companies which operate trains-on-wheels for travel between resorts.\n\nFor the avid historians there is a preserved [[Cerro da Vila|Roman site]] and museum providing an insight to the area's past. Originally a Roman fishing town, the ruins include baths in which the mariners used to bathe.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nThe marina will be extended with Cidade Lacustre the new project that Lusort will be developing in Vilamoura in the next few years.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{commons category|Vilamoura}}\n{{wikivoyage|Vilamoura}}\n\n* [https://www.dompedrogolf.com/ Official Website of Dom Pedro Golf]\n* [http://www.pbase.com/valterj/vilamoura Photos of Vilamoura]\n* [http://www.vilamouraportugal.org Vilamoura Essential Guide]\n* [http://www.portugal-book.com/algarve/vilamoura/index.htm Vilamoura Photos]\n* [http://www.vilamourauncovered.com/Portals/Vilamoura/map/map_vilamoura.pdf Vilamoura Map]\n* [http://www.360travelguide.com/360VirtualTour.asp?iCode=alg102 Panoramic Virtual Tour of Vilamoura Marina]\n\n{{coord|37|4|40|N|8|6|55|W|type:city_region:PT_source:nlwiki|display=title}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Seaside resorts in Portugal]]\n[[Category:Towns in Portugal]]\n[[Category:Tourist attractions in Portugal]]\n[[Category:Marinas in Portugal]]\n[[Category:Loul\u00e9]]\n", "name_user": "Zdtrlik", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vilamoura"}
