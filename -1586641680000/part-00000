In overtime, Seattle won the coin toss, and Wilson threw a game-winning touchdown pass to [[Jermaine Kearse]] on the first possession.\n\nThe teams have met four times in the playoffs, with the Packers winning three.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/sea/playoffs.htm | title = Seattle Seahawks Playoff History | publisher = Sports Reference LLC | access-date = March 13, 2020 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190925204240/https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/sea/playoffs.htm | archive-date = September 25, 2019 | url-status = live }}</ref> In addition to the two meetings cited above, Green Bay won 42\u201320 in [[2007\u201308 NFL playoffs|2007\u201308]] and 28\u201323 in the [[2019\u201320 NFL playoffs|2019\u201320]],<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.si.com/nfl/2020/01/13/packers-beat-seahawks-advance-to-nfc-championship |title=Packers Leaving it All on the Field, Win After Win |last=Kahler |first=Kalyn |date=2020-01-13 |website=Sports Illustrated |language=en-us |access-date=2020-03-21}}</ref> both in the Divisional round.\n\n==Results==\n{{Expand section|date=March 2020}}\n{| class=\"toccolours collapsible\" style=\"width:90%; clear:both; margin:1.5em auto; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! colspan=2 style=\"{{NFLAltPrimaryStyle|Oakland Raiders}};\" |  Green Bay Packers vs. Seattle Seahawks Season-by-Season Results\n|- value=\"top\"\n|<div class=\"NavFrame\">\n<div class=\"NavHead\" style=\"{{NFLAltPrimaryStyle|Oakland Raiders}};\">1970s \u2013 1990s (Tied, 4\u20134)</div>\n<div class=\"NavContent\" \nstyle=\"text-align:center; display:none;\">\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center; font-size:95%\"\n|-\n!

King Andrew II was forced by his nobles to accept the Golden Bull (Aranybulla), which was one of the first examples of constitutional limits being placed on the powers of a European monarch.<ref>Francis Fukuyama: What\u2019s Wrong with Hungary?</ref>  The Golden Bull was issued at the year 1222 [[diet (assembly)|diet]] of [[Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r|Feh\u00e9rv\u00e1r]].<ref>[http://www.rubicon.hu/magyar/oldalak/1222_aprilis_24_ii_andras_kiadja_az_aranybullat_fehervaron/ 1222. \u00e1prilis 24. | II. Andr\u00e1s kiadja az Aranybull\u00e1t Feh\u00e9rv\u00e1ron - Rubicon T\u00f6rt\u00e9nelmi Magazin]</ref> The law established the rights of the [[Hungarian nobility]], including the right to disobey the King when he acted contrary to law (''jus resistendi''). The nobles and the church were freed from all taxes and could not be forced to go to war outside of Hungary and were not obligated to finance it. This was also a historically important document because it set down the principles of equality for all of the nation's nobility.<ref name=\"Kormos\">Kormos, 2005</ref> Seven copies of the edict were created, one for each of the following institutions: to the [[Pope]], to the [[Knights Templar]], to the [[Knights Hospitaller]], to the [[Kings of Hungary|Hungarian king]] itself, to the [[Chapter (religion)|chapters]] of [[Esztergom]] and [[Kalocsa]] and to the [[Palatine (Kingdom of Hungary)|palatine]].\n\nThe charter's creation was influenced by the emergence of a nobility [[middle class]], unusual in the nation's [[feudal system]]. As a regular gesture of generosity, King Andrew often donated property to particularly faithful servants, who thereafter gained new economic and class power. With the nation's class system and economic state changing, King Andrew found himself coerced into decreeing the Golden Bull of 1222 to relax tensions between hereditary nobles and the budding middle class nobility.<ref>Molnar, 2001, pp. 32\u201333.</ref>\n\nThe Golden Bull is often compared to [[Magna Carta]]; the Bull was the first [[constitutional]] document of the nation of Hungary, while Magna Carta was the first constitutional [[charter]] of the nation of [[England]].<ref name=\"Kormos\"/>\n\n== Background ==\n\n=== Grants of liberties ===\n\nThe Golden Bull that [[Andrew II of Hungary]] issued in the spring of 1222 is \"one of a number of charters published in thirteenth-century Christendom that sought to constrain the royal power.\"{{sfn|Rady|2014|p=88}} [[Peter II of Aragon]] had already in 1205 planned to make concessions to his subjects.{{sfn|Holt|1992|p=25}} [[Simon de Montfort, 5th Earl of Leicester|Simon de Montfort]], supreme commander of the [[Albigensian Crusade]], issued the [[Statute of Pamiers]] in 1212, confirming the privileges of the clergymen and limiting the authority of the future rulers of [[County of Toulouse|Toulouse]] and [[County of Carcassonne|Carcassone]].{{sfn|Rady|2014|p=88}}{{sfn|Vincent|2012|p=62}} The statute influenced the [[Magna Carta]] of [[John, King of England]], which also secured the liberties of the Church and regulated feudal relationships in 1215.{{sfn|Vincent|2012|p=62}} The [[Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]], strengthened the authority of the [[Prince-bishop#Holy Roman Empire|imperial prelates]] in 1220.{{sfn|Holt|1992|p=25}}\n\nContacts between Hungary and these countries can be demonstrated during this period.{{sfn|Rady|2014|p=88}} Aragonese nobles settled in Hungary in the early 13th century.{{sfn|Rady|2014|p=88}} Hungarian participants of the [[Fifth Crusade]] could meet [[Robert Fitzwalter]] and other leaders of the movement which had achieved the issue of the Magna Carta.{{sfn|Ronay|1978|pp=77\u201380}} Two Hungarian prelates visited [[Canterbury]] in 1220.{{sfn|Rady|2014|p=88}} However, no direct connection between the texts of the Golden Bull and other early 13th-century grants of liberties can be demonstrated.{{sfn|Rady|2014|p=88}} Historian [[James Clarke Holt]] says, there is no need to assume that the authors of these documents borrowed from each other, because all these charters embodied the \"natural reaction of feudal societies to monarchical importunity\".{{sfn|Holt|1992|p=27}}\n\n=== Hungarian society ===\n\n{{Further|Kingdom of Hungary (1000\u20131301)}}\n\nThe existence of at least a dozen distinct social groups can be documented in Hungary in the 12th and 13th centuries.{{sfn|Moln\u00e1r|2001|p=32}} Freemen and serfs were the two fundamental categories, but intermediate \"semi-free\" groups also existed.{{sfn|Kontler|1999|p=69}}{{sfn|Berend|Urba\u0144czyk|Wiszewski|2013|p=274}} Freemen could  in theory freely choose their lords, but they were in practice required to remain loyal to their masters.{{sfn|Kontler|1999|p=69}} On the other hand, unfree warriors could hold large estates which were legally protected against arbitrary actions of royal officials.{{sfn|Rady|2000|p=20}}\n\nThe highest-ranking royal officials were appointed from among men who regarded themselves{{sfn|Rady|2000|pp=23\u201324}} the descendants of either the Hungarian chieftains of the period of the establishment of the kingdom or of the foreign warriors who settled in Hungary during the subsequent centuries.{{sfn|Kontler|1999|p=69}} They were mentioned as \"noblemen\" from the end of the 12th century,{{sfn|Rady|2000|p=28}} but they did not form a hereditary elite.{{sfn|Kontler|1999|p=69}} The most prominent families started to name themselves after their forefathers in the 1200s, but their genealogies were often fabricated.{{sfn|Rady|2000|pp=23\u201324}} The ''[[Gesta Hungarorum]]'', which was completed around 1200, emphasized that the ancestors of many noblemen played a preeminent role in the [[Hungarian Conquest of the Carpathian Basin]].{{sfn|Blazovich|1999|p=185}}\n\nInitially, each freeman was required to serve in the royal army.{{sfn|Rady|2000|p=20}} Those who were unable to perform this duty were obliged to pay taxes in the 12th century.{{sfn|Berend|Urba\u0144czyk|Wiszewski|2013|p=275}} The majority of the [[castle warrior]]s were unfree, but freemen could also choose to serve the ''[[isp\u00e1n]]s'' (or heads) of the royal castles.{{sfn|Berend|Urba\u0144czyk|Wiszewski|2013|p=276}} They were to defend the royal castles and accompany the monarchs to their military campaigns in exchange for the parcels they held in royal lands around the castles.{{sfn|Berend|Urba\u0144czyk|Wiszewski|2013|p=276}} Free castle warriors could also retain their own estates.{{sfn|Berend|Urba\u0144czyk|Wiszewski|2013|p=276}} The highest ranking castle warriors started to refer to themselves as \"freemen\" or \"warriors of the holy kings\" to emphasize their privileged status.{{sfn|Berend|Urba\u0144czyk|Wiszewski|2013|p=276}}\n\nThousands of foreigners{{mdash}}Slavs, Germans, Italians and Walloons{{mdash}}came to Hungary to populate the sparsely inhabited lands or to work in the centers of royal administration.{{sfn|Berend|Urba\u0144czyk|Wiszewski|2013|p=276}} These \"guests\" preserved their personal freedom even if they settled in the estates of the aristocrats or churchmen.{{sfn|Berend|Urba\u0144czyk|Wiszewski|2013|p=276}} [[Jews in Hungary|Jews]] could legally settle only in the centers of the bishoprics, but they actually also lived in other towns.{{sfn|Berend|Urba\u0144czyk|Wiszewski|2013|p=255}} They were primarily merchants, engaged in long-distance trade.{{sfn|Berend|Urba\u0144czyk|Wiszewski|2013|p=256}} [[B\u00f6sz\u00f6rm\u00e9ny|Muslims who settled in Hungary]] were primarily employed in the administration of royal revenues, but the presence of Muslim warriors is also documented.{{sfn|Berend|Urba\u0144czyk|Wiszewski|2013|p=256}}\n\n=== Transformation ===\n[[File:Aranybulla1.jpg|thumb|250px|Golden Bull of 1222]]\n\n[[B\u00e9la III of Hungary]], who ruled from 1172 to 1196, was one of the wealthiest European monarchs of his time, according to a summary of his revenues.{{sfn|Moln\u00e1r|2001|p=46}} He earned income from the periodical exchange of coins, royal salt monopoly and customs duties, but significant part of his revenues came from the royal estates,{{sfn|Berend|Urba\u0144czyk|Wiszewski|2013|p=287}} because he owned more than half of landed property in the kingdom.{{sfn|Kontler|1999|p=70}} He decreed that each transaction proceeding in his presence was to be recorded, which gave rise to the development of the royal chancellery.{{sfn|Kontler|1999|p=70}}{{sfn|Rady|2000|p=66}} Thereafter private transactions were also frequently recorded and preserved at specific monasteries or cathedral chapters, known as \"[[place of authentication|places of authentication]]\".{{sfn|Kontler|1999|p=70}}\n\nB\u00e9la III's eldest son and successor, [[Emeric, King of Hungary|Emeric]], faced a series of rebellions initiated by his younger brother, Andrew.{{sfn|Berend|Urba\u0144czyk|Wiszewski|2013|p=178}} Both the king and his brother, who seized Croatia and Dalmatia, made generous grants to their partisans to secure their loyalty.{{sfn|Makkai|1990|p=23}}{{sfn|Blazovich|1999|p=185}} Prelates and high-ranking officials supported Andrew against the king, but Emeric defeated his brother.{{sfn|Zsoldos|2011|p=17}} Andrew mounted the throne after the sudden death of Emeric's infant son, [[Ladislaus III of Hungary|Ladislaus III]], in 1205.{{sfn|Kontler|1999|p=75}}\n\nAndrew appointed his former supporters to the highest offices, but most of his brother's former officials could retain their offices, because he needed their assistance.{{sfn|Zsoldos|2011|pp=17\u201318}} For instance, four of Andrew's first seven [[Palatine of Hungary|palatines]]{{mdash}}[[Cs\u00e9p\u00e1n Gy\u0151r]] and his brother, [[Pat Gy\u0151r|Pat]], [[Julius I K\u00e1n|Julius K\u00e1n]] and [[B\u00e1nk B\u00e1r-Kal\u00e1n]]{{mdash}}had held offices already during Emeric's reign.{{sfn|Zsoldos|2011|p=19}} The ''isp\u00e1ns'' of [[B\u00e1cs County|B\u00e1cs]], [[Sopron County|Sopron]], [[Zala County (former)|Zala]] and other important [[County (Kingdom of Hungary)|counties]] were mostly nominated from among Emeric's former supporters.{{sfn|Zsoldos|2011|pp=18\u201319}} The heads of the royal household{{mdash}}including the [[Master of the horse (Kingdom of Hungary)|master of the horse]] and the [[master of the stewards]]{{mdash}}became the members of the royal council during Andrew's reign.{{sfn|Zsoldos|2011|p=19}} He always appointed one of his old partisans to these new offices.{{sfn|Zsoldos|2011|p=19}}\n\nAndrew started to grant large areas of royal estates and significant sums of money to his former supporters.{{sfn|Zsoldos|2011|p=20}} For instance, Alexander of the [[Hont-P\u00e1zm\u00e1ny]] clan, who had helped Andrew to flee from his brother's prison, received 300 marks in 1217.{{sfn|Zsoldos|2011|pp=19\u201320}} Andrew's predecessors had also donated royal estates in perpetuity, but mostly those situated in the borderlands.{{sfn|Berend|Urba\u0144czyk|Wiszewski|2013|p=427}} Breaking with this practise, Andrew gave away large domains which were located in the central regions.{{sfn|Berend|Urba\u0144czyk|Wiszewski|2013|p=427}} The new policy of donations, known as ''novae institutiones'' (\"new arrangements\"), significantly reduced the revenues of the ''isp\u00e1ns'' of the counties, because one third of all royal revenues from their counties were due to them.{{sfn|Zsoldos|2011|p=20}} The \"new arrangements\" also diminished royal revenues.{{sfn|Makkai|1990|p=23}} Andrew introduced new taxes and ordered the exchange of coins twice a year to secure the funds to the maintenance of his royal court.{{sfn|Makkai|1990|pp=23\u201324}}{{sfn|Blazovich|1999|p=186}} He farmed out the collection of the taxes and the administration of the royal mint to Jews and Muslims.{{sfn|Makkai|1990|p=23}}{{sfn|Moln\u00e1r|2001|p=33}}\n\nAccording to a widespread scholarly theory, the appearance of wealthy landowners in the counties threatened the social position of both the free and unfree royal warriors.{{sfn|Kontler|1999|p=77}}{{sfn|Berend|Urba\u0144czyk|Wiszewski|2013|p=428}} Lesser landowners started to emphasize their direct link to the monarch.{{sfn|Kontler|1999|p=76}} According to the available sources, landowners from [[Hossz\u00fahet\u00e9ny]] were the first to call themselves \"freemen and [[Royal servant (Kingdom of Hungary)|royal servants]]\" during a court case against the abbot of [[P\u00e9csv\u00e1rad Abbey]] in 1212.{{sfn|Zsoldos|2011|p=12}} Andrew started to grant the same status from the 1210s.{{sfn|Zsoldos|2011|p=12}} Royal servants were to serve in the royal army, but independently of the ''isp\u00e1ns'' who were the commanders of the county

King Andrew II was forced by his nobles to accept the Golden Bull (Aranybulla), which was one of the first examples of constitutional limits being placed on the powers of a European monarch.<ref>Francis Fukuyama: What\u2019s Wrong with Hungary?</ref>  The Golden Bull was issued at the year 1222 [[diet (assembly)|diet]] of [[Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r|Feh\u00e9rv\u00e1r]].<ref>[http://www.rubicon.hu/magyar/oldalak/1222_aprilis_24_ii_andras_kiadja_az_aranybullat_fehervaron/ 1222. \u00e1prilis 24. | II. Andr\u00e1s kiadja az Aranybull\u00e1t Feh\u00e9rv\u00e1ron - Rubicon T\u00f6rt\u00e9nelmi Magazin]</ref> The law established the rights of the [[Hungarian nobility]], including the right to disobey the King when he acted contrary to law (''jus resistendi''). The nobles and the church were freed from all taxes and could not be forced to go to war outside of Hungary and were not obligated to finance it. This was also a historically important document because it set down the principles of equality for all of the nation's nobility.<ref name=\"Kormos\">Kormos, 2005</ref> Seven copies of the edict were created, one for each of the following institutions: to the [[Pope]], to the [[Knights Templar]], to the [[Knights Hospitaller]], to the [[Kings of Hungary|Hungarian king]] itself, to the [[Chapter (religion)|chapters]] of [[Esztergom]] and [[Kalocsa]] and to the [[Palatine (Kingdom of Hungary)|palatine]].\n\nThe charter's creation was influenced by the emergence of a nobility [[middle class]], unusual in the nation's [[feudal system]]. As a regular gesture of generosity, King Andrew often donated property to particularly faithful servants, who thereafter gained new economic and class power. With the nation's class system and economic state changing, King Andrew found himself coerced into decreeing the Golden Bull of 1222 to relax tensions between hereditary nobles and the budding middle class nobility.<ref>Molnar, 2001, pp. 32\u201333.</ref>\n\nThe Golden Bull is often compared to [[Magna Carta]]; the Bull was the first [[constitutional]] document of the nation of Hungary, while Magna Carta was the first constitutional [[charter]] of the nation of [[England]].<ref name=\"Kormos\"/>\n\n== Background ==\n\n=== Grants of liberties ===\n\nThe Golden Bull that [[Andrew II of Hungary]] issued in the spring of 1222 is \"one of a number of charters published in thirteenth-century Christendom that sought to constrain the royal power.\"{{sfn|Rady|2014|p=88}} [[Peter II of Aragon]] had already in 1205 planned to make concessions to his subjects.{{sfn|Holt|1992|p=25}} [[Simon de Montfort, 5th Earl of Leicester|Simon de Montfort]], supreme commander of the [[Albigensian Crusade]], issued the [[Statute of Pamiers]] in 1212, confirming the privileges of the clergymen and limiting the authority of the future rulers of [[County of Toulouse|Toulouse]] and [[County of Carcassonne|Carcassone]].{{sfn|Rady|2014|p=88}}{{sfn|Vincent|2012|p=62}} The statute influenced the [[Magna Carta]] of [[John, King of England]], which also secured the liberties of the Church and regulated feudal relationships in 1215.{{sfn|Vincent|2012|p=62}} The [[Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]], strengthened the authority of the [[Prince-bishop#Holy Roman Empire|imperial prelates]] in 1220.{{sfn|Holt|1992|p=25}}\n\nContacts between Hungary and these countries can be demonstrated during this period.{{sfn|Rady|2014|p=88}} Aragonese nobles settled in Hungary in the early 13th century.{{sfn|Rady|2014|p=88}} Hungarian participants of the [[Fifth Crusade]] could meet [[Robert Fitzwalter]] and other leaders of the movement which had achieved the issue of the Magna Carta.{{sfn|Ronay|1978|pp=77\u201380}} Two Hungarian prelates visited [[Canterbury]] in 1220.{{sfn|Rady|2014|p=88}} However, no direct connection between the texts of the Golden Bull and other early 13th-century grants of liberties can be demonstrated.{{sfn|Rady|2014|p=88}} Historian [[James Clarke Holt]] says, there is no need to assume that the authors of these documents borrowed from each other, because all these charters embodied the \"natural reaction of feudal societies to monarchical importunity\".{{sfn|Holt|1992|p=27}}\n\n=== Hungarian society ===\n\n{{Further|Kingdom of Hungary (1000\u20131301)}}\n\nThe existence of at least a dozen distinct social groups can be documented in Hungary in the 12th and 13th centuries.{{sfn|Moln\u00e1r|2001|p=32}} Freemen and serfs were the two fundamental categories, but intermediate \"semi-free\" groups also existed.{{sfn|Kontler|1999|p=69}}{{sfn|Berend|Urba\u0144czyk|Wiszewski|2013|p=274}} Freemen could  in theory freely choose their lords, but they were in practice required to remain loyal to their masters.{{sfn|Kontler|1999|p=69}} On the other hand, unfree warriors could hold large estates which were legally protected against arbitrary actions of royal officials.{{sfn|Rady|2000|p=20}}\n\nThe highest-ranking royal officials were appointed from among men who regarded themselves{{sfn|Rady|2000|pp=23\u201324}} the descendants of either the Hungarian chieftains of the period of the establishment of the kingdom or of the foreign warriors who settled in Hungary during the subsequent centuries.{{sfn|Kontler|1999|p=69}} They were mentioned as \"noblemen\" from the end of the 12th century,{{sfn|Rady|2000|p=28}} but they did not form a hereditary elite.{{sfn|Kontler|1999|p=69}} The most prominent families started to name themselves after their forefathers in the 1200s, but their genealogies were often fabricated.{{sfn|Rady|2000|pp=23\u201324}} The ''[[Gesta Hungarorum]]'', which was completed around 1200, emphasized that the ancestors of many noblemen played a preeminent role in the [[Hungarian Conquest of the Carpathian Basin]].{{sfn|Blazovich|1999|p=185}}\n\nInitially, each freeman was required to serve in the royal army.{{sfn|Rady|2000|p=20}} Those who were unable to perform this duty were obliged to pay taxes in the 12th century.{{sfn|Berend|Urba\u0144czyk|Wiszewski|2013|p=275}} The majority of the [[castle warrior]]s were unfree, but freemen could also choose to serve the ''[[isp\u00e1n]]s'' (or heads) of the royal castles.{{sfn|Berend|Urba\u0144czyk|Wiszewski|2013|p=276}} They were to defend the royal castles and accompany the monarchs to their military campaigns in exchange for the parcels they held in royal lands around the castles.{{sfn|Berend|Urba\u0144czyk|Wiszewski|2013|p=276}} Free castle warriors could also retain their own estates.{{sfn|Berend|Urba\u0144czyk|Wiszewski|2013|p=276}} The highest ranking castle warriors started to refer to themselves as \"freemen\" or \"warriors of the holy kings\" to emphasize their privileged status.{{sfn|Berend|Urba\u0144czyk|Wiszewski|2013|p=276}}\n\nThousands of foreigners{{mdash}}Slavs, Germans, Italians and Walloons{{mdash}}came to Hungary to populate the sparsely inhabited lands or to work in the centers of royal administration.{{sfn|Berend|Urba\u0144czyk|Wiszewski|2013|p=276}} These \"guests\" preserved their personal freedom even if they settled in the estates of the aristocrats or churchmen.{{sfn|Berend|Urba\u0144czyk|Wiszewski|2013|p=276}} [[Jews in Hungary|Jews]] could legally settle only in the centers of the bishoprics, but they actually also lived in other towns.{{sfn|Berend|Urba\u0144czyk|Wiszewski|2013|p=255}} They were primarily merchants, engaged in long-distance trade.{{sfn|Berend|Urba\u0144czyk|Wiszewski|2013|p=256}} [[B\u00f6sz\u00f6rm\u00e9ny|Muslims who settled in Hungary]] were primarily employed in the administration of royal revenues, but the presence of Muslim warriors is also documented.{{sfn|Berend|Urba\u0144czyk|Wiszewski|2013|p=256}}\n\n=== Transformation ===\n[[File:Aranybulla1.jpg|thumb|250px|Golden Bull of 1222]]\n\n[[B\u00e9la III of Hungary]], who ruled from 1172 to 1196, was one of the wealthiest European monarchs of his time, according to a summary of his revenues.{{sfn|Moln\u00e1r|2001|p=46}} He earned income from the periodical exchange of coins, royal salt monopoly and customs duties, but significant part of his revenues came from the royal estates,{{sfn|Berend|Urba\u0144czyk|Wiszewski|2013|p=287}} because he owned more than half of landed property in the kingdom.{{sfn|Kontler|1999|p=70}} He decreed that each transaction proceeding in his presence was to be recorded, which gave rise to the development of the royal chancellery.{{sfn|Kontler|1999|p=70}}{{sfn|Rady|2000|p=66}} Thereafter private transactions were also frequently recorded and preserved at specific monasteries or cathedral chapters, known as \"[[place of authentication|places of authentication]]\".{{sfn|Kontler|1999|p=70}}\n\nB\u00e9la III's eldest son and successor, [[Emeric, King of Hungary|Emeric]], faced a series of rebellions initiated by his younger brother, Andrew.{{sfn|Berend|Urba\u0144czyk|Wiszewski|2013|p=178}} Both the king and his brother, who seized Croatia and Dalmatia, made generous grants to their partisans to secure their loyalty.{{sfn|Makkai|1990|p=23}}{{sfn|Blazovich|1999|p=185}} Prelates and high-ranking officials supported Andrew against the king, but Emeric defeated his brother.{{sfn|Zsoldos|2011|p=17}} Andrew mounted the throne after the sudden death of Emeric's infant son, [[Ladislaus III of Hungary|Ladislaus III]], in 1205.{{sfn|Kontler|1999|p=75}}\n\nAndrew appointed his former supporters to the highest offices, but most of his brother's former officials could retain their offices, because he needed their assistance.{{sfn|Zsoldos|2011|pp=17\u201318}} For instance, four of Andrew's first seven [[Palatine of Hungary|palatines]]{{mdash}}[[Cs\u00e9p\u00e1n Gy\u0151r]] and his brother, [[Pat Gy\u0151r|Pat]], [[Julius I K\u00e1n|Julius K\u00e1n]] and [[B\u00e1nk B\u00e1r-Kal\u00e1n]]{{mdash}}had held offices already during Emeric's reign.{{sfn|Zsoldos|2011|p=19}} The ''isp\u00e1ns'' of [[B\u00e1cs County|B\u00e1cs]], [[Sopron County|Sopron]], [[Zala County (former)|Zala]] and other important [[County (Kingdom of Hungary)|counties]] were mostly nominated from among Emeric's former supporters.{{sfn|Zsoldos|2011|pp=18\u201319}} The heads of the royal household{{mdash}}including the [[Master of the horse (Kingdom of Hungary)|master of the horse]] and the [[master of the stewards]]{{mdash}}became the members of the royal council during Andrew's reign.{{sfn|Zsoldos|2011|p=19}} He always appointed one of his old partisans to these new offices.{{sfn|Zsoldos|2011|p=19}}\n\nAndrew started to grant large areas of royal estates and

The RTLM reported the latest massacres, victories, and political event in a way that promoted their anti-Tutsi agenda. In an attempt to dehumanize and degrade, the RTLM consistently referred to Tutsis and the RPF as 'cockroaches' during their broadcasts.<ref>{{cite web|title=042 - Loose Tape RTLM 68|url=http://migs.concordia.ca/links/RwandanRadioTrascripts_RTLM.htm|publisher=Concordia University|accessdate=12 October 2017}}</ref> The music of Hutu [[Simon Bikindi]] was played frequently.

The RTLM reported the latest massacres, victories, and political event in a way that promoted their anti-Tutsi agenda.

Tukhachevsky used concentrated attacks to exploit the enemy's open flanks and threaten them with envelopment.\n\nHe also helped defeat General [[Anton Denikin]] in the [[Crimea]] in 1920, conducting the final operations. In February 1920, he launched an offensive into the [[Kuban]], using cavalry to disrupt the enemy's rear. In the retreat that followed, Denikin's force disintegrated, and [[Novorossiysk]] was evacuated hastily.\n\nIn the final stage of the civil war, Tukhachevsky commanded the [[7th Army (RSFSR)|7th Army]] during the suppression of the [[Kronstadt rebellion]] in March 1921. He also commanded the assault against the [[Tambov rebellion|Tambov Republic]] between 1921 and 1922.

In the leadup to hostilities, Tukhachevsky concentrated his troops near [[Vitebsk]], which he theatrically dubbed, \"The Gates of [[Smolensk]]\". When he issued his troops orders to cross the border, Tukhachevsky said, \"The fate of world revolution is being decided in the west: the way leads over the corpse of Poland to a universal conflagration....

The Soviet High Command dispatched 60,000 men as reinforcements, but Tukhachevsky never stopped to let them catch up. His onrushing armies were leaving behind greater numbers of stragglers every day, but Tukhachevsky ignored these losses.

There would be no arrest and trial of Tukhachevsky in 1930: the commander \"turns out to be 100% clean,\" Stalin wrote disingenuously to Molotov in October, \"That's very good.\" It is interesting that seven years before the [[Great Purge|Great Terror]], Stalin was testing the same accusations against the same victims--a dress [[rehearsal]] for 1937--but he could not get the support. The archives reveal a fascinating sequel: once he understood the ambitious modernity of Tukhachevsky's strategies, Stalin apologised to him: \"Now the question has become clearer to me, I have to agree that my remark was too strong and my conclusions were not right at all.\"<ref>''Stalin: The Court of the Red Tsar'', page 59.</ref>}}\n\nFollowing this, Tukhachevsky wrote several books on modern warfare and, in 1931, after Stalin had accepted the need for an industrialized military, Tukhachevsky was given a leading role in reforming the army.<ref name=\":0\" /> He held advanced ideas on military strategy, particularly on the use of tanks and aircraft in combined operations.<ref name=\":0\" />  \n\nTukhachevsky took a keen interest in the arts, and became a political patron and close friend of composer [[Dmitri Shostakovich]]; they met in 1925<ref>Elizabeth Wilson, ''Shostakovich: a Life Remembered'', p. 39.</ref> and subsequently played music together at the Marshal's home (Tukhachevsky played the violin).

They were expressed as a concept in the Red Army's ''Field Regulations of 1929'' and more fully developed in 1935's ''Instructions on Deep Battle''. The concept was finally codified into the army in 1936 in the ''Provisional Field Regulations of 1936''. An early example of the potential effectiveness of deep operations can be found in the Soviet victory over Japan at the [[Battle of Khalkhin Gol]] ([[Nomonhan]]),{{citation needed|date=April 2019}} where a Soviet Corps under the command of [[Georgy Zhukov]] defeated a substantial Japanese force in August and September 1939.\n\nIt is often stated that the widespread purges of the Red Army officer corps in 1937 to 1939 made \"deep operations\" briefly fall from favour.<ref>{{Cite book|last= Sebag|first= Simon|title=Stalin: The Court of the Red Tsar|isbn=978-1-4000-7678-9|page=342|chapter=31|year= 2005}}</ref> However, they were certainly a major part of Soviet doctrine after their efficiency was demonstrated by the Battle of Khalkin Gol and the success of similar German operations in Poland and France.

In January 1936, Tukhachevsky visited the [[United Kingdom]], [[French Third Republic|France]], and [[Nazi Germany|Germany]].\n\nJust before his arrest, Tukhachevsky was relieved of duty as assistant to Marshal [[Kliment Voroshilov]] and appointed military commander of the Volga Military District.<ref name=\"Tainye\">Fyodor Mikhailovich Sergeyev, ''Tainye operatsii natsistskoi razvediki, 1933-1945'' (In Russian).

Tukhachevsky's confession, which survives in the archives, is dappled with a brown spray that was later found to be blood-spattered by a body in motion.<ref name=\"Stalin page 223\">''Stalin: Court of the Red Tsar'', page 223.</ref>\n\n[[File:May 25 1937 Tukhachevsky recognition.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Tukhachevsky's bloodstained confession]]\n\nStalin commented, \"It's incredible, but it's a fact, they admit it.\"<ref name=\"Stalin page 223\"/>\n\nOn June 11, 1937, the Soviet Supreme Court convened a special [[military tribunal]] to try Tukhachevsky and eight Generals for treason. The trial was dubbed the [[Case of Trotskyist Anti-Soviet Military Organization]]. Upon hearing the accusations, Tukhachevsky was heard to say, \"I feel I'm dreaming.\"<ref name=\"Stalin page 225\">''Stalin: Court of the Red Tsar'', page 225.</ref> Most of the judges were also terrified. One was heard to comment, \"Tomorrow I'll be put in the same place.\"<ref name=\"Stalin page 225\"/> (Five of the eight officers serving as judges in that court martial were later executed themselves.) It was explained to the accused that the trial was being conducted according to the law of 1 December 1934, so defense attorneys were barred from the courtroom and appeals against the verdict were forbidden.<ref>Sergeyev (1991): p. 20</ref>\n\nAt 11:35 that night, all of the defendants were declared guilty and sentenced to death. Stalin, who was awaiting the verdict with Molotov, [[Lazar Kaganovich|Kaganovich]] and Yezhov, did not even examine the transcripts. He simply said, \"Agreed.\"<ref name=\"Stalin page 225\"/>\n\nWithin the hour, Tukhachevsky was summoned from his cell by NKVD captain [[Vasili Blokhin]]. As Yezhov watched, the former Marshal was shot once in the back of the head.<ref name=\"Rayfield\">Donald Rayfield, Donald (2005). ''Stalin and His Hangmen: the tyrant and those who killed for him''.

Stalin asked, \"What were Tukhachevsky's last words?\"<ref name=\"Stalin page 225\"/> Yezhov responded, \"The snake said he was dedicated to the Motherland and Comrade Stalin. He asked for [[clemency]]. But it was obvious that he was not being straight, he hadn't laid down his arms.\"<ref name=\"Stalin page 225\"/>\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:USSR stamp M.Tukhachevsky 1963 4k.jpg|thumb|A 1963 Soviet stamp featuring Tukhachevsky]]\nTukhachevsky's family members all suffered after his execution. His wife, Nina Tukhachevskaya, and his brothers Alexandr and Nikolai, both instructors in a Soviet military academy, were all shot. Three of his sisters were sent to the [[Gulag]]. His underage daughter was arrested when she reached adulthood and remained in the Gulag until the 1950s [[Khrushchev thaw]]. She lived in Moscow after her release and died in 1982.<ref name=\"Tainye page 44\">Sergeyev (1991): p.44</ref>\n\nBefore [[Nikita Khrushchev]]'s [[On the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences|Secret Speech]] in 1956, Tukhachevsky was officially considered a [[fascist]] and [[fifth columnist]]. Soviet diplomats and apologists in the West enthusiastically promulgated this opinion. Then, on January 31, 1957, Tukhachevsky and his codefendants were declared innocent of all charges and were \"rehabilitated\".\n\nAlthough Tukhachevsky's prosecution is almost universally regarded as a sham, Stalin's motivations continue to be debated. In his 1968 book ''The Great Terror'', British historian [[Robert Conquest]] accuses [[Nazi Party]] leaders [[Heinrich Himmler]] and [[Reinhard Heydrich]] of forging documents that implicated Tukhachevsky in an anti-Stalinist conspiracy with the [[Wehrmacht]] [[General Staff]], to weaken the Soviet Union's defence capacity. These documents, Conquest said, were leaked to President [[Edvard Bene\u0161]] of [[Czechoslovakia]], who passed them to Soviet Russia through diplomatic channels. Conquest's thesis of an SS conspiracy to frame Tukhachevsky was based upon the memoirs of [[Walter Schellenberg]] and Bene\u0161.<ref name=\"Lukes, Igor 1996 p. 95\">Lukes, Igor, ''Czechoslovakia Between Stalin and Hitler: The Diplomacy of Edvard Bene\u0161 in the 1930s'', Oxford University Press (1996), {{ISBN|0-19-510267-3}}, {{ISBN|978-0-19-510267-3}}, p. 95</ref>\n\nIn 1989, the Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union announced that new evidence had been found in Stalin's archives indicating German intelligence's intentions to fabricate disinformation about Tukhachevsky with the goal of eliminating him. \"Knowledge of personal characteristics of Stalin - like paranoia and extreme suspicion, had been possibly highest factor in it.\"<ref name=\"Tainye page 3\">Sergeyev (1991): p. 3</ref>\n\nAccording to the opinion of Igor Lukes, who conducted a study on the matter, it was Stalin, Kaganovich and Yezhov who actually concocted Tukhachevsky's \"treason\" themselves. At Yezhov's order, the NKVD had instructed a known [[double agent]], [[Nikolai Skoblin]], to leak to Heydrich's [[Sicherheitsdienst]] (SD) concocted information suggesting a plot by Tukhachevsky and the other Soviet generals against Stalin.<ref name=\"Lukes, Igor 1996 p. 95\"/>\n\nSeeing an opportunity to strike a blow at the Soviet military, Heydrich immediately acted on the information and undertook to improve on it. Heydrich's forgeries were later leaked to the Soviets via Bene\u0161 and other neutral nations. While the SD believed that it had successfully fooled Stalin into executing his best generals, in reality, it had merely served as an unwitting pawn of the Soviet NKVD. Ironically, Heydrich's forgeries were never used at trial. Instead, Soviet prosecutors relied on signed \"confessions\" beaten out of the defendants.<ref name=\"Lukes, Igor 1996 p. 95\"/>\n\nIn 1956, NKVD [[defector]] [[Aleksandr Mikhailovich Orlov]] published an article in ''[[Life Magazine]]'' with \"The Sensational Secret Behind the Damnation of Stalin\" as title. The story held that NKVD agents had discovered papers in the tsarist [[Okhrana]] archives proving Stalin had once been an informer. From this knowledge, the NKVD agents had planned a [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] with Tukhachevsky and other senior officers in the Red Army.<ref>Roman Brackman [https://books.google.com/books?id=zQL8POkFGIQC&pg=RA1-PA262&lpg=RA1-PA262&dq=the+fatal+find+in+menzhinsky+office&source=bl&ots=3Rmvi_BLDA&sig=Y1B339vQSzH6uBCqfiTC-cqO8Z0&hl=en&ei=8d0qSoSKMOGJtgen-cS-CA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1 ''The secret file of Joseph Stalin: a hidden life''] 466 pp. Published by Routledge, 2001 {{ISBN|0-7146-5050-1}} {{ISBN|978-0-7146-5050-0}}</ref> According to Orlov, Stalin uncovered the conspiracy and used Yezhov to execute those responsible.<ref>Paul W.

After all, he had played with the idea as early as 1930, three years before Hitler took power. Furthermore, Stalin and his cronies were convinced that officers were to be distrusted and physically exterminated at the slightest suspicion. He reminisced to Voroshilov, in an undated note, about the officers arrested in the summer of 1918. \"These officers,\" he said, \"we wanted to shoot en masse.\" Nothing had changed.<ref>Montefiore, ''Stalin: Court of the Red Tsar'', page 226.</ref>}}\n\nAccording to Montefiore, Stalin had always known that the Red Army was the only institution that could have resisted his quest for [[autocracy|absolute power]]. Stalin's paranoia about internal subversion and belief in his own infallible ability to detect traitors did the rest. Stalin and Yezhov orchestrated the arrest and execution of thousands of Soviet military officers after Tukhachevsky was shot. Ultimately, five of the eight generals who presided over Tukhachevsky's \"trial\" were arrested and shot by the NKVD.<ref name=\"Barmine, Alexander 1945 p. 322\">Barmine, Alexander, ''One Who Survived'', New York: G.P.

Following the [[October Revolution]] of 1917, Tukhachevsky joined the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Bolsheviks]] and went on to play a key role in the [[Red Army]] - despite his noble ancestry.\n\n==During the Civil War==\n[[File:Tuchaczewski 1920.jpg|thumb|110px|Tukhachevsky in 1920]]\nHe became an officer in the newly established Red Army and rapidly advanced in rank because of his great ability.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}} During the [[Russian Civil War]], he was given responsibility for defending Moscow.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}} The Bolshevik Defence Commissar, [[Leon Trotsky]], gave Tukhachevsky command of the [[5th Army (RSFSR)|5th Army]] in 1919, and he led the campaign to capture [[Siberia]] from the [[anticommunist]] [[White movement|White]] forces of [[Aleksandr Kolchak]]. Tukhachevsky used concentrated attacks to exploit the enemy's open flanks and threaten them with envelopment.\n\nHe also helped defeat General [[Anton Denikin]] in the [[Crimea]] in 1920, conducting the final operations. In February 1920, he launched an offensive into the [[Kuban]], using cavalry to disrupt the enemy's rear. In the retreat that followed, Denikin's force disintegrated, and [[Novorossiysk]] was evacuated hastily.\n\nIn the final stage of the civil war, Tukhachevsky commanded the [[7th Army (RSFSR)|7th Army]] during the suppression of the [[Kronstadt rebellion]] in March 1921. He also commanded the assault against the [[Tambov rebellion|Tambov Republic]] between 1921 and 1922.

In the leadup to hostilities, Tukhachevsky concentrated his troops near [[Vitebsk]], which he theatrically dubbed, \"The Gates of [[Smolensk]]\". When he issued his troops orders to cross the border, Tukhachevsky said, \"The fate of world revolution is being decided in the west: the way leads over the corpse of Poland to a universal conflagration....

The Soviet High Command dispatched 60,000 men as reinforcements, but Tukhachevsky never stopped to let them catch up. His onrushing armies were leaving behind greater numbers of stragglers every day, but Tukhachevsky ignored these losses. His supply services were in chaos and his rear scarcely existed as an organized entity, but Tukhachevsky was unconcerned; his men would live off the land.

There would be no arrest and trial of Tukhachevsky in 1930: the commander \"turns out to be 100% clean,\" Stalin wrote disingenuously to Molotov in October, \"That's very good.\" It is interesting that seven years before the [[Great Purge|Great Terror]], Stalin was testing the same accusations against the same victims--a dress [[rehearsal]] for 1937--but he could not get the support. The archives reveal a fascinating sequel: once he understood the ambitious modernity of Tukhachevsky's strategies, Stalin apologised to him: \"Now the question has become clearer to me, I have to agree that my remark was too strong and my conclusions were not right at all.\"<ref>''Stalin: The Court of the Red Tsar'', page 59.</ref>}}\n\nFollowing this, Tukhachevsky wrote several books on modern warfare and, in 1931, after Stalin had accepted the need for an industrialized military, Tukhachevsky was given a leading role in reforming the army.<ref name=\":0\" /> He held advanced ideas on military strategy, particularly on the use of tanks and aircraft in combined operations.<ref name=\":0\" />  \n\nTukhachevsky took a keen interest in the arts, and became a political patron and close friend of composer [[Dmitri Shostakovich]]; they met in 1925<ref>Elizabeth Wilson, ''Shostakovich: a Life Remembered'', p. 39.</ref> and subsequently played music together at the Marshal's home (Tukhachevsky played the violin). In 1936, Shostakovich's music was under attack following the ''[[Pravda]]'' denunciation of his opera ''[[Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District (opera)|Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk]]''. However, Tukhachevsky intervened with Stalin on his friend's behalf.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} After Tukhachevsky's arrest, pressure was put on Shostakovich to denounce him, but he was saved from doing so by the fact that the investigator was himself arrested.<ref>Elizabeth Wilson, pp. 124-5.</ref>\n\n==Theory of deep operation==\n{{Main|Deep operation}}\n[[File:Tuhacsevszkij1936.JPG|thumb|upright|Tukhachevsky in 1936]]\nTukhachevsky is often credited with the theory of deep operation in which combined arms formations strike deep behind enemy lines to destroy the enemy's rear and logistics,<ref name=Simpkin>[[Richard Simpkin]] in association with [[John Erickson (historian)|John Erickson]] ''Deep battle: the brainchild of Marshal Tukhachevskii'', London, Brassey's Defence, 1987 {{ISBN|0-08-031193-8}}</ref><ref>[[Aleksandr Vasilevsky|Alexander Vasilevsky]] ''The Case of All My Life'' (\u0414\u0435\u043b\u043e \u0432\u0441\u0435\u0439 \u0436\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0438). 3d ed. \u041f\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0442\u0438\u0437\u0434\u0430\u0442, 1978 [http://victory.mil.ru/lib/books/memo/vasilevsky/08.html Chapter8] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929120459/http://victory.mil.ru/lib/books/memo/vasilevsky/08.html |date=2007-09-29 }} {{in lang|ru}}</ref> but his exact role is unclear and disputed because of shortage of firsthand sources, and his published works containing only limited amounts of theory on the subject.

They were expressed as a concept in the Red Army's ''Field Regulations of 1929'' and more fully developed in 1935's ''Instructions on Deep Battle''. The concept was finally codified into the army in 1936 in the ''Provisional Field Regulations of 1936''. An early example of the potential effectiveness of deep operations can be found in the Soviet victory over Japan at the [[Battle of Khalkhin Gol]] ([[Nomonhan]]),{{citation needed|date=April 2019}} where a Soviet Corps under the command of [[Georgy Zhukov]] defeated a substantial Japanese force in August and September 1939.\n\nIt is often stated that the widespread purges of the Red Army officer corps in 1937 to 1939 made \"deep operations\" briefly fall from favour.<ref>{{Cite book|last= Sebag|first= Simon|title=Stalin: The Court of the Red Tsar|isbn=978-1-4000-7678-9|page=342|chapter=31|year= 2005}}</ref> However, they were certainly a major part of Soviet doctrine after their efficiency was demonstrated by the Battle of Khalkin Gol and the success of similar German operations in Poland and France.

The trial was dubbed the [[Case of Trotskyist Anti-Soviet Military Organization]]. Upon hearing the accusations, Tukhachevsky was heard to say, \"I feel I'm dreaming.\"<ref name=\"Stalin page 225\">''Stalin: Court of the Red Tsar'', page 225.</ref> Most of the judges were also terrified. One was heard to comment, \"Tomorrow I'll be put in the same place.\"<ref name=\"Stalin page 225\"/> (Five of the eight officers serving as judges in that court martial were later executed themselves.) It was explained to the accused that the trial was being conducted according to the law of 1 December 1934, so defense attorneys were barred from the courtroom and appeals against the verdict were forbidden.<ref>Sergeyev (1991): p. 20</ref>\n\nAt 11:35 that night, all of the defendants were declared guilty and sentenced to death. Stalin, who was awaiting the verdict with Molotov, [[Lazar Kaganovich|Kaganovich]] and Yezhov, did not even examine the transcripts. He simply said, \"Agreed.\"<ref name=\"Stalin page 225\"/>\n\nWithin the hour, Tukhachevsky was summoned from his cell by NKVD captain [[Vasili Blokhin]]. As Yezhov watched, the former Marshal was shot once in the back of the head.<ref name=\"Rayfield\">Donald Rayfield, Donald (2005). ''Stalin and His Hangmen: the tyrant and those who killed for him''.

Stalin asked, \"What were Tukhachevsky's last words?\"<ref name=\"Stalin page 225\"/> Yezhov responded, \"The snake said he was dedicated to the Motherland and Comrade Stalin. He asked for [[clemency]]. But it was obvious that he was not being straight, he hadn't laid down his arms.\"<ref name=\"Stalin page 225\"/>\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:USSR stamp M.Tukhachevsky 1963 4k.jpg|thumb|A 1963 Soviet stamp featuring Tukhachevsky]]\nTukhachevsky's family members all suffered after his execution. His wife, Nina Tukhachevskaya, and his brothers Alexandr and Nikolai, both instructors in a Soviet military academy, were all shot. Three of his sisters were sent to the [[Gulag]]. His underage daughter was arrested when she reached adulthood and remained in the Gulag until the 1950s [[Khrushchev thaw]]. She lived in Moscow after her release and died in 1982.<ref name=\"Tainye page 44\">Sergeyev (1991): p.44</ref>\n\nBefore [[Nikita Khrushchev]]'s [[On the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences|Secret Speech]] in 1956, Tukhachevsky was officially considered a [[fascist]] and [[fifth columnist]]. Soviet diplomats and apologists in the West enthusiastically promulgated this opinion. Then, on January 31, 1957, Tukhachevsky and his codefendants were declared innocent of all charges and were \"rehabilitated\".\n\nAlthough Tukhachevsky's prosecution is almost universally regarded as a sham, Stalin's motivations continue to be debated. In his 1968 book ''The Great Terror'', British historian [[Robert Conquest]] accuses [[Nazi Party]] leaders [[Heinrich Himmler]] and [[Reinhard Heydrich]] of forging documents that implicated Tukhachevsky in an anti-Stalinist conspiracy with the [[Wehrmacht]] [[General Staff]], to weaken the Soviet Union's defence capacity. These documents, Conquest said, were leaked to President [[Edvard Bene\u0161]] of [[Czechoslovakia]], who passed them to Soviet Russia through diplomatic channels. Conquest's thesis of an SS conspiracy to frame Tukhachevsky was based upon the memoirs of [[Walter Schellenberg]] and Bene\u0161.<ref name=\"Lukes, Igor 1996 p. 95\">Lukes, Igor, ''Czechoslovakia Between Stalin and Hitler: The Diplomacy of Edvard Bene\u0161 in the 1930s'', Oxford University Press (1996), {{ISBN|0-19-510267-3}}, {{ISBN|978-0-19-510267-3}}, p. 95</ref>\n\nIn 1989, the Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union announced that new evidence had been found in Stalin's archives indicating German intelligence's intentions to fabricate disinformation about Tukhachevsky with the goal of eliminating him. \"Knowledge of personal characteristics of Stalin - like paranoia and extreme suspicion, had been possibly highest factor in it.\"<ref name=\"Tainye page 3\">Sergeyev (1991): p. 3</ref>\n\nAccording to the opinion of Igor Lukes, who conducted a study on the matter, it was Stalin, Kaganovich and Yezhov who actually concocted Tukhachevsky's \"treason\" themselves. At Yezhov's order, the NKVD had instructed a known [[double agent]], [[Nikolai Skoblin]], to leak to Heydrich's [[Sicherheitsdienst]] (SD) concocted information suggesting a plot by Tukhachevsky and the other Soviet generals against Stalin.<ref name=\"Lukes, Igor 1996 p. 95\"/>\n\nSeeing an opportunity to strike a blow at the Soviet military, Heydrich immediately acted on the information and undertook to improve on it. Heydrich's forgeries were later leaked to the Soviets via Bene\u0161 and other neutral nations. While the SD believed that it had successfully fooled Stalin into executing his best generals, in reality, it had merely served as an unwitting pawn of the Soviet NKVD. Ironically, Heydrich's forgeries were never used at trial. Instead, Soviet prosecutors relied on signed \"confessions\" beaten out of the defendants.<ref name=\"Lukes, Igor 1996 p. 95\"/>\n\nIn 1956, NKVD [[defector]] [[Aleksandr Mikhailovich Orlov]] published an article in ''[[Life Magazine]]'' with \"The Sensational Secret Behind the Damnation of Stalin\" as title. The story held that NKVD agents had discovered papers in the tsarist [[Okhrana]] archives proving Stalin had once been an informer. From this knowledge, the NKVD agents had planned a [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] with Tukhachevsky and other senior officers in the Red Army.<ref>Roman Brackman [https://books.google.com/books?id=zQL8POkFGIQC&pg=RA1-PA262&lpg=RA1-PA262&dq=the+fatal+find+in+menzhinsky+office&source=bl&ots=3Rmvi_BLDA&sig=Y1B339vQSzH6uBCqfiTC-cqO8Z0&hl=en&ei=8d0qSoSKMOGJtgen-cS-CA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1 ''The secret file of Joseph Stalin: a hidden life''] 466 pp. Published by Routledge, 2001 {{ISBN|0-7146-5050-1}} {{ISBN|978-0-7146-5050-0}}</ref> According to Orlov, Stalin uncovered the conspiracy and used Yezhov to execute those responsible.<ref>Paul W.

After all, he had played with the idea as early as 1930, three years before Hitler took power. Furthermore, Stalin and his cronies were convinced that officers were to be distrusted and physically exterminated at the slightest suspicion. He reminisced to Voroshilov, in an undated note, about the officers arrested in the summer of 1918. \"These officers,\" he said, \"we wanted to shoot en masse.\" Nothing had changed.<ref>Montefiore, ''Stalin: Court of the Red Tsar'', page 226.</ref>}}\n\nAccording to Montefiore, Stalin had always known that the Red Army was the only institution that could have resisted his quest for [[autocracy|absolute power]]. Stalin's paranoia about internal subversion and belief in his own infallible ability to detect traitors did the rest. Stalin and Yezhov orchestrated the arrest and execution of thousands of Soviet military officers after Tukhachevsky was shot. Ultimately, five of the eight generals who presided over Tukhachevsky's \"trial\" were arrested and shot by the NKVD.<ref name=\"Barmine, Alexander 1945 p. 322\">Barmine, Alexander, ''One Who Survived'', New York: G.P.

Instead, the muskox's closest living relatives appear to be the [[goral]]s of the genus ''[[Naemorhedus]]'', nowadays common in many countries of central and east Asia. The vague similarity between takin and muskox must therefore be considered an example of [[convergent evolution]].<ref name=\"Lent1999\">{{cite book|author=Peter C.

Muskox ancestors with sheep-like high-positioned horns (horn cores being mostly over the plane of the [[frontal bone]]s, rather than below them as in modern muskoxen) first left the temperate forests for the developing grasslands of [[Central Asia]] during the [[Pliocene]], expanding into [[Siberia]] and the rest of northern [[Eurasia]]. Later migration waves of Asian ungulates that included high-horned muskoxen reached [[Europe]] and [[North America]] during the first half of the [[Pleistocene]]. The first well known muskox, the \"shrub-ox\" ''[[Euceratherium]]'', crossed to North America over an early version of the [[Bering Land Bridge]] two million years ago and prospered in the [[American southwest]] and [[Mexico]]. ''Euceratherium'' was larger yet more lightly built than modern muskoxen, resembling a giant sheep with massive horns, and preferred hilly grasslands.\n\nA genus with intermediate horns, ''[[Soergelia]]'', inhabited Eurasia in the early Pleistocene, from [[Spain]] to Siberia, and crossed to North America during the [[Irvingtonian]] (1.8 million years to 240,000 years ago), soon after ''Euceratherium''. Unlike ''Euceratherium'', which survived in America until the Pleistocene-[[Holocene]] [[Quaternary extinction event|extinction event]], ''Soergelia'' was a lowland dweller that disappeared fairly early, displaced by more advanced ungulates, such as the \"giant muskox\" ''[[Praeovibos priscus|Praeovibos]]'' (literally \"before ''Ovibos''\"). The low-horned ''Praeovibos'' was present in Europe and the [[Mediterranean]] 1.5 million years ago, colonized [[Alaska]] and the [[Yukon]] one million years ago and disappeared half a million years ago. ''Praeovibos'' was a highly adaptable animal that appears associated with cold tundra ([[reindeer]]) and temperate woodland ([[red deer]]) faunas alike. During the [[Mindel glaciation]] 500,000 years ago, ''Praeovibos'' was present in the [[Kolyma river]] area in eastern Siberia in association with many [[Ice Age]] [[megafauna]] that would later coexist with ''Ovibos'', in the Kolyma itself and elsewhere, including [[wild horse]]s, reindeer, [[woolly mammoth]] and [[Cervalces|stag-moose]]. It is debated, however, if ''Praeovibos'' was directly ancestral to ''Ovibos'', or both genera descended from a common ancestor, since the two occurred together during the middle Pleistocene. Defenders of ancestry from ''Praeovibos'' have proposed that ''Praeovibos'' evolved into ''Ovibos'' in one region during a period of isolation and expanded later, replacing the remaining populations of ''Praeovibos''.<ref name=\"Lent1999\" />\n\n[[File:Bootherium bombifrons.JPG|thumb|left|''[[Bootherium]]'' skull]]Two more ''Praeovibos''-like genera were named in America in the 19th century, ''[[Bootherium]]'' and ''Symbos'', which are now identified as the male and female forms of a single, [[sexual dimorphism|sexually dimorphic]] species, the \"woodland muskox\", ''Bootherium bombifrons''. ''Bootherium'' inhabited open woodland areas of North America during the late Pleistocene, from Alaska to [[Texas]] and maybe even Mexico, but was most common in the [[Southern United States]], while ''Ovibos'' replaced it in the tundra-steppe to the north, immediately south of the [[Laurentian ice sheet]].<ref name=\"Lent1999\" /><ref name=\"Wisconsinan Mammalian Faunas\">{{cite web|url=http://www.kgs.ku.edu/Publications/Bulletins/GB5/Martin2/|title=KGS--Guidebook 5--Wisconsinan Mammalian Faunas|work=ku.edu}}</ref>\n\nModern ''Ovibos'' appeared in [[Germany]] almost one million years ago and was common in the region through the Pleistocene. By the Mindel, muskoxen had also reached the [[British Isles]].

In 1967, 14 animals were captured near [[Eureka, Nunavut|Eureka]] on [[Ellesmere Island]] by the Institute for Northern Agricultural Research (INAR), and brought to a farm in Old Fort Chimo [[Kuujjuaq]], northern Quebec, for domestication to provide a local cottage industry based on ''[[qiviut]]'', one of the world's finest natural fibers. Although the animals thrived and the ''qiviut'' industry showed early success with the training of Inuit knitters and marketing, it soon became clear that the Quebec government had never intended that the muskoxen be domestic, but had used INAR to capture muskoxen to provide a wild population for hunting. Government officials demanded that INAR leave Quebec and the farm be closed. Subsequently, 54 animals from the farm were released in three places in northern Quebec between 1973 and 1983, and the remaining were ceded to local [[zoo]]s. Between 1983 and 1986, the released animals increased from 148 to 290, at a rate of 1.25 per year, and by 2003, an estimated 1400 muskoxen were in Quebec. Additionally, 112 adults and 25 calves were counted in the nearby [[Diana Island]] in 2005, having arrived there by their own means from the continent.

Muskoxen will eat grasses, [[Arctic willow|arctic willow]]s, woody plants, lichens, and mosses. When food is abundant, they prefer succulent and nutritious grasses in an area. Willows are the most commonly eaten plants in the winter. Muskoxen require a high threshold of fat reserves in order to conceive, which reflects their conservative breeding strategy. Winter ranges typically have shallow snow to reduce the energy costs of digging through snow to reach forage.<ref name=iucn /> The primary predators of muskoxen are [[Arctic wolf|arctic wolves]], which may account for up to half of all mortality for the species.

It is one of the two largest [[extant taxon|extant]] members of Caprinae, along with the similarly sized [[takin]].<ref name=\"Burnie\">Burnie D and Wilson DE (Eds.), ''Animal: The Definitive Visual Guide to the World's Wildlife''. DK Adult (2005), {{ISBN|0-7894-7764-5}}</ref> While the takin and muskox were once considered possibly closely related, the takin lacks common ovibovine features, such as the muskox's specialized horn morphology, and genetic analysis shows that their lineages actually separated early in caprine evolution. Instead, the muskox's closest living relatives appear to be the [[goral]]s of the genus ''[[Naemorhedus]]'', nowadays common in many countries of central and east Asia. The vague similarity between takin and muskox must therefore be considered an example of [[convergent evolution]].<ref name=\"Lent1999\">{{cite book|author=Peter C.

Muskox ancestors with sheep-like high-positioned horns (horn cores being mostly over the plane of the [[frontal bone]]s, rather than below them as in modern muskoxen) first left the temperate forests for the developing grasslands of [[Central Asia]] during the [[Pliocene]], expanding into [[Siberia]] and the rest of northern [[Eurasia]]. Later migration waves of Asian ungulates that included high-horned muskoxen reached [[Europe]] and [[North America]] during the first half of the [[Pleistocene]]. The first well known muskox, the \"shrub-ox\" ''[[Euceratherium]]'', crossed to North America over an early version of the [[Bering Land Bridge]] two million years ago and prospered in the [[American southwest]] and [[Mexico]]. ''Euceratherium'' was larger yet more lightly built than modern muskoxen, resembling a giant sheep with massive horns, and preferred hilly grasslands.\n\nA genus with intermediate horns, ''[[Soergelia]]'', inhabited Eurasia in the early Pleistocene, from [[Spain]] to Siberia, and crossed to North America during the [[Irvingtonian]] (1.8 million years to 240,000 years ago), soon after ''Euceratherium''. Unlike ''Euceratherium'', which survived in America until the Pleistocene-[[Holocene]] [[Quaternary extinction event|extinction event]], ''Soergelia'' was a lowland dweller that disappeared fairly early, displaced by more advanced ungulates, such as the \"giant muskox\" ''[[Praeovibos priscus|Praeovibos]]'' (literally \"before ''Ovibos''\"). The low-horned ''Praeovibos'' was present in Europe and the [[Mediterranean]] 1.5 million years ago, colonized [[Alaska]] and the [[Yukon]] one million years ago and disappeared half a million years ago. ''Praeovibos'' was a highly adaptable animal that appears associated with cold tundra ([[reindeer]]) and temperate woodland ([[red deer]]) faunas alike. During the [[Mindel glaciation]] 500,000 years ago, ''Praeovibos'' was present in the [[Kolyma river]] area in eastern Siberia in association with many [[Ice Age]] [[megafauna]] that would later coexist with ''Ovibos'', in the Kolyma itself and elsewhere, including [[wild horse]]s, reindeer, [[woolly mammoth]] and [[Cervalces|stag-moose]]. It is debated, however, if ''Praeovibos'' was directly ancestral to ''Ovibos'', or both genera descended from a common ancestor, since the two occurred together during the middle Pleistocene. Defenders of ancestry from ''Praeovibos'' have proposed that ''Praeovibos'' evolved into ''Ovibos'' in one region during a period of isolation and expanded later, replacing the remaining populations of ''Praeovibos''.<ref name=\"Lent1999\" />\n\n[[File:Bootherium bombifrons.JPG|thumb|left|''[[Bootherium]]'' skull]]Two more ''Praeovibos''-like genera were named in America in the 19th century, ''[[Bootherium]]'' and ''Symbos'', which are now identified as the male and female forms of a single, [[sexual dimorphism|sexually dimorphic]] species, the \"woodland muskox\", ''Bootherium bombifrons''. ''Bootherium'' inhabited open woodland areas of North America during the late Pleistocene, from Alaska to [[Texas]] and maybe even Mexico, but was most common in the [[Southern United States]], while ''Ovibos'' replaced it in the tundra-steppe to the north, immediately south of the [[Laurentian ice sheet]].<ref name=\"Lent1999\" /><ref name=\"Wisconsinan Mammalian Faunas\">{{cite web|url=http://www.kgs.ku.edu/Publications/Bulletins/GB5/Martin2/|title=KGS--Guidebook 5--Wisconsinan Mammalian Faunas|work=ku.edu}}</ref>\n\nModern ''Ovibos'' appeared in [[Germany]] almost one million years ago and was common in the region through the Pleistocene. By the Mindel, muskoxen had also reached the [[British Isles]]. Both Germany and Britain were just south of the [[Scandinavian ice sheet]] and covered in tundra during cold periods, but Pleistocene muskoxen are also rarely recorded in more benign and wooded areas to the south like [[France]] and [[Green Spain]], where they coexisted with temperate ungulates like red deer and [[aurochs]].

In 1967, 14 animals were captured near [[Eureka, Nunavut|Eureka]] on [[Ellesmere Island]] by the Institute for Northern Agricultural Research (INAR), and brought to a farm in Old Fort Chimo [[Kuujjuaq]], northern Quebec, for domestication to provide a local cottage industry based on ''[[qiviut]]'', one of the world's finest natural fibers. Although the animals thrived and the ''qiviut'' industry showed early success with the training of Inuit knitters and marketing, it soon became clear that the Quebec government had never intended that the muskoxen be domestic, but had used INAR to capture muskoxen to provide a wild population for hunting. Government officials demanded that INAR leave Quebec and the farm be closed. Subsequently, 54 animals from the farm were released in three places in northern Quebec between 1973 and 1983, and the remaining were ceded to local [[zoo]]s. Between 1983 and 1986, the released animals increased from 148 to 290, at a rate of 1.25 per year, and by 2003, an estimated 1400 muskoxen were in Quebec. Additionally, 112 adults and 25 calves were counted in the nearby [[Diana Island]] in 2005, having arrived there by their own means from the continent. [[Vagrancy (biology)|Vagrant]] adults are sometimes spotted in [[Labrador]], though no herds have been observed in the region.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.canadianfieldnaturalist.ca/index.php/cfn/article/view/398/398|title=The Occurrence of Muskoxen,  Ovibos moschatus in Labrador \u2013 Chubbs \u2013 The Canadian Field-Naturalist|volume=121|issue=1|pages=81\u201384|journal=Canadian Field-Naturalist|year=2007|last1=Brazil|first1=J.|last2=Chubbs|first2=Tony E.}}</ref>\n\n== Ecology ==\nDuring the summer, muskoxen live in wet areas, such as river valleys, moving to higher elevations in the winter to avoid deep snow. Muskoxen will eat grasses, [[Arctic willow|arctic willow]]s, woody plants, lichens, and mosses. When food is abundant, they prefer succulent and nutritious grasses in an area. Willows are the most commonly eaten plants in the winter. Muskoxen require a high threshold of fat reserves in order to conceive, which reflects their conservative breeding strategy. Winter ranges typically have shallow snow to reduce the energy costs of digging through snow to reach forage.<ref name=iucn /> The primary predators of muskoxen are [[Arctic wolf|arctic wolves]], which may account for up to half of all mortality for the species.

Programs to control machine operation are typically stored in battery-backed-up or [[non-volatile memory]].\n\nPLCs were first developed in the automobile manufacturing industry to provide flexible, rugged and easily programmable controllers to replace hard-wired [[relay logic]] systems. Since then, they have been widely adopted as high-reliability automation controllers suitable for harsh environments.\n\nA PLC is an example of a \"hard\" [[Real-time computing|real-time]] system since output results must be produced in response to input conditions within a limited time, otherwise unintended operation will result.\n\n==Invention and early development==\nPLC originated in the late 1960s in the automotive industry in the USA and were designed to replace relay logic systems.<ref name=\":3\" /> Before, control logic for manufacturing was mainly composed of [[Relay|relays]], [[Cam timer|cam timers]], [[Drum sequencer (controller)|drum sequencers]], and dedicated closed-loop controllers. \n\nThe hard-wired nature made it difficult for design engineers to alter the process. Changes would require rewiring and careful updating of the documentation. If even one wire were out of place, or one relay failed, the whole system would become faulty. Often times technicians would spend hours troubleshooting by examining the schematics and comparing them to existing wiring.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.controlsystemsandautomation.com/learn/plc/plc-programming-basics-i/|title=PLC Programming Basics Part I|date=2019-07-23|website=Control Systems & Automation|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-23}}</ref> When general-purpose computers became available, they were soon applied to control sequential and combinatorial logic in industrial processes.{{Fact|date=February 2020}} These early computers required specialist programmers and strict control of working conditions, such as temperature, cleanliness, and power quality.{{Fact|date=February 2020}} \n\nThe PLC was developed with several advantages over earlier designs. It tolerated the industrial environment better than computers and was more reliable, compact and required less maintenance than relay systems. It was easily extensible with additional I/O modules, while relay systems required complicated hardware changes in case of reconfiguration. This allowed for easier iteration over manufacturing process design. Comparing to a computer, PLC in a rack format can be more easily extended with additional I/O in the form of I/O cards. With simple programming language focused on logic and switching operations it was more user-friendly than computers using [[General-purpose programming language|general-purpose programming languages]].

As programming terminals evolved, it became more common for ladder logic to be used, because it was a familiar format used for electro-mechanical control panels. Newer formats, such as state logic and Function Block (which is similar to the way logic is depicted when using digital integrated logic circuits) exist, but they are still{{When|date=February 2020}} not as popular as ladder logic. A primary reason for this is that PLCs solve the logic in a predictable and repeating sequence, and ladder logic allows the person writing the logic to see any issues with the timing of the logic sequence more easily than would be possible in other formats.{{Fact|date=February 2020}}\n\nUp to the mid-1990s, PLCs were programmed using proprietary programming panels or special-purpose programming [[Computer terminal|terminals]], which often had dedicated function keys representing the various logical elements of PLC programs.<ref name=\"EERef162\" /> Some proprietary programming terminals displayed the elements of PLC programs as graphic symbols, but plain [[ASCII art|ASCII]] character representations of contacts, coils, and wires were common. Programs were stored on [[Cassette tape cartridge|cassette tape cartridges]]. Facilities for printing and documentation were minimal due to lack of memory capacity. The oldest PLCs used [[non-volatile]] [[magnetic core memory]].\n\n== Architecture ==\nRegular programmable logic controller consists of:\n\n* a processor unit (CPU) which interprets inputs, executes the control program stored in memory and sends output signals,\n* a power supply unit which converts AC voltage to DC,\n* a memory unit storing data from inputs and program to be executed by the processor,\n* an input and output interfaces, where the controller receives and sends data from/to external devices,\n* a communications interface to receive and transmit data on communication networks from/to remote PLCs.<ref name=\":4\">{{Harvnb|Bolton|2015|p=7}}</ref>\n\nPLCs require programming device which is used to develop and later download the created program into the memory of the controller.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nModern PLCs generally contain a [[real-time operating system]], such as [[OS-9]] or [[VxWorks]].<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n===Mechanical design===\n[[File:Siemens_sps_logo_8_12-24_RCE-03.jpg|thumb|Compact PLC with 8 inputs and 4 outputs.]]\n[[File:PLC_AB_InstaladoV1.JPG|alt=Modular PLC with EtherNet/IP module, digital and analog I/O, with some slots being empty.|thumb|Modular PLC with [[EtherNet/IP]] module, discrete and analog I/O, with some slots being empty.]]\nThere are two types of mechanical design for PLC systems. A ''single box'', or a ''brick'' is a small programmable controller that fits all units and interfaces into one compact casing, although, typically, additional expansion modules for inputs and outputs are available. Second design type \u2013 a ''modular'' PLC \u2013 has a chassis (also called a ''rack'') that provides space for modules with different functions, such as power supply, processor, selection of I/O modules and communication interfaces \u2013 which all can be customized for the particular application.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bolton|2015|pp=12\u201313}}</ref> Several racks can be administered by a single processor, and may have thousands of inputs and outputs. Either a special high speed serial I/O link or comparable communication method is used so that racks can be distributed away from the processor, reducing the wiring costs for large plants. Options are also available to mount I/O points directly to the machine and utilize quick disconnecting cables to sensors and valves, saving time for wiring and replacing components.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n===Discrete (digital) and analog signals===\n{{Overly detailed|section|details=an excessive explanations of scaling of values|date=April 2020}}\n[[Digital signal|Discrete (digital) signals]] behave as binary switches, yielding simply an On or Off signal (1 or 0, True or False, respectively). Push buttons, [[limit switch]]es, and [[photoelectric sensor]]s are examples of devices providing a discrete signal. Discrete signals are sent using either [[voltage]] or [[current (electricity)|current]], where a specific range is designated as ''On'' and another as ''Off''. For example, a PLC might use 24 V DC I/O, with values above 22 V DC representing ''On'', values below 2VDC representing ''Off'', and intermediate values undefined. Initially, PLCs had only digital I/O.\n\nAnalog signals are like volume controls, with a range of values between zero and full-scale. These are typically interpreted as integer values (counts) by the PLC, with various ranges of accuracy depending on the device and the number of bits available to store the data. As PLCs typically use 16-bit signed binary processors, the integer values are limited between -32,768 and +32,767. Pressure, temperature, flow, and weight are often represented by analog signals. Analog signals can use [[voltage]] or [[current (electricity)|current]] with a magnitude proportional to the value of the process signal. For example, an analog 0 to 10&nbsp;V or [[4-20 mA]] input would be [[analog-to-digital converter|converted]] into an integer value of 0 to 32767.  The programming inside the PLC will use a SCL or scaling function to take this 0-32767 value and transpose it into the desired units of the process so the operator or program can read it.  Proper integration will also include filter times to reduce noise as well as high and low limits to report faults.\n\n[[Current loop|Current inputs]] are less sensitive to electrical noise (e.g. from welders or electric motor starts) than voltage inputs.  Distance from the device and the controller is also a concern as the maximum travelling distance of a good quality 0-10V signal is very short compared to the 4-20mA signal.  The 4-20mA signal can also report if the wire is disconnected along the path as it would return a 0mA signal and a fault can be reported.\n\n===Timers and counters===\n{{Overly detailed|section|details=an excessive explanation of types of timers|date=April 2020}}\nThe main function of a timer is to keep an output on for a specific length of time.  A good example of this is a garage light, where you want power to be cut off after 2 minutes so as to give someone time to go into the house. The three different types of timers that are commonly used are a Delay-OFF, a Delay-ON, and a Delay-ON-Retentive. A Delay-OFF timer activates immediately when turned on, and will start counting down from a programmed time before cutting off once the enabling input is off. A Delay-ON timer is activated by input and starts accumulating time, counts up to a programmed time before cutting off, and is cleared when the enabling input is turned off. A Delay-ON-Retentive timer is activated by input and starts accumulating time, retains the accumulated value even if the (ladder-logic) rung goes false, and can be reset only by a RESET command.  Visible details for the rest of the program to use could include:\n\n*EN - ENable signal, indicated the timer has been enabled and can start timing, or if completed keep the DoNe status on.\n*PRE - PREset time, requested time value to be run before the timer is DoNe.  Could be in a TIME format (t#1h35m12s) or in seconds format (3500 = 3.5s)\n*ACC - ACCumulated time, how long the timer has been timing.  Same number formats as the PREset value.\n*DN - DoNe signal, indicates the timer has elapsed the preset value\n*TT - Timer Timing signal, indicates the timer is actively timing.  This is not on once the timer is done\n\nCounters are primarily used for counting items such as cans going into a box on an assembly line. This is important because once something is filled to its max the item needs to be moved on so something else can be filled. Many companies use counters in PLC's to count boxes, count how many feet of something is covered, or to count how many pallets are on a truck.  There are three types of counters, Up counters, Down counters, and Up/Down counters. Up counters count up to the preset value, turn on the CTU (CounT Up output) when the preset value is reached, and are cleared upon receiving a reset.  Down counters count down from a preset value, turns on the CTD (CounT Down output) when 0 is reached, and are cleared upon reset. Up/Down counters count up on CU, count down on CD, turn on CTUD (CounT Up/Down output) when the preset value is reached, and cleared on reset.<ref>Yanik, P. (2017, April 11). Timers and Counters. Cullowhee, NC, United States of America.</ref>\n\n===Redundancy===\nSome special processes need to work permanently with minimum unwanted down time. Therefore, it is necessary to design a system which is fault-tolerant and capable of handling the process with faulty modules. In such cases to increase the system availability in the event of hardware component failure, redundant CPU or I/O modules with the same functionality can be added to hardware configuration for preventing total or partial process shutdown due to hardware failure.  Other redundancy scenarios  could be related to safety critical processes, for example large hydraulic presses could require that both PLCs turn on an output before the press can come down in case one output does not turn off properly.\n\n==Programming==\n[[File:Automate industriel WAGO pour un syst\u00e8me de monitoring en industrie pharmaceutique.jpg|thumb|Industrial controller for a monitoring system in the pharmaceutical industry]]\nProgrammable logic controllers are intended to be used by engineers without programming background. For this reason, graphical programming language called [[Ladder logic|Ladder Diagram]] (LD, LAD) was first developed which resembles the schematic diagram of a system built with electromechanical relays. It was adopted by many manufacturers and later standardized in the [[IEC 61131-3]] control systems programming standard. {{As of|2015|}}, it is still widely used, thanks to its simplicity.<ref name=\":6\">{{Harvnb|Bolton|2015|pp=16\u201318}}</ref>\n\n{{As of|2015|}}, the majority of PLC systems adhere to the [[IEC 61131-3]] standard that defines 2 textual programming languages: [[Structured text|Structured Text]] (ST; similar to [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]]) and [[Instruction list|Instruction List]] (IL); as well as 3 graphical languages: [[Ladder logic|Ladder Diagram]], [[Function block diagram|Function Block Diagram]] (FBD) and [[Sequential function chart|Sequential Function Chart]] (SFC).<ref name=\":6\" /><ref>Keller, William L Jr. ''Grafcet, A Functional Chart for Sequential Processes'', 14th Annual International Programmable Controllers Conference Proceedings, 1984, p. 71-96.</ref> [[Instruction list|Instruction List]] (IL) was deprecated in the third edition of the standard.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://plcopen.org/status-iec-61131-3-standard|title=Status IEC 61131-3 standard|last=|first=|date=2018-07-19|website=PLCopen|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-01}}</ref>\n\nModern PLCs can be programmed in a variety of ways, from the relay-derived ladder logic to programming languages such as specially adapted dialects of [[BASIC]] and [[C (programming language)|C]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}\n\nWhile the fundamental concepts of PLC programming are common to all manufacturers, differences in I/O addressing, memory organization, and instruction sets mean that PLC programs are never perfectly interchangeable between different makers. Even within the same product line of a single manufacturer, different models may not be directly compatible.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}\n\nPLC programs are typically written in programming device which can take form of a desktop console, a special software on a [[personal computer]], or a handheld programming device.<ref name=\":7\">{{Harvnb|Bolton|2015|pp=19\u201320}}</ref> Then, the program is downloaded to the PLC directly or over a network. It is stored either in non-volatile [[flash memory]] or battery-backed-up [[RAM]]. In some programmable controllers, the program is transferred from a personal computer to the PLC through a programming board which writes the program into a removable chip, such as [[EPROM]].\n\nProgram written on personal computer can be easily copied and backed up on external storage. Manufacturers develop programming software for their controllers. In addition to being able to program PLCs in multiple languages, they provide common features like hardware diagnostics and maintenance, software debugging, and offline simulation.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nThe program can be uploaded for backup and restoration purposes.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}\n\n===Simulation===\nIn order to properly understand the operation of a PLC, it is necessary to spend considerable time [[Computer programming|programming]], testing and [[debugging]] PLC programs. PLC systems are inherently expensive, and down-time is often very costly. In addition, if a PLC is programmed incorrectly it can result in lost productivity and dangerous conditions. PLC simulation software such as PLCLogix can save time in the design of automated control applications and can also increase the level of safety associated with equipment since many \"what if\" scenarios can be tried and tested before the system is activated.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Lin|first1=Sally|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CHYlTBxqrM8C&pg=PA553|title=Advances in Computer Science, Environment, Ecoinformatics, and Education, Part III: International Conference, CSEE 2011, Wuhan, China, August 21-22, 2011.

A ladder diagram is a method of drawing control circuits which pre-dates PLCs. The ladder diagram resembles the schematic diagram of a system built with electromechanical relays.\n\nAs an example, say a facility needs to store water in a tank. The water is drawn from the tank by another system, as needed, and our example system must manage the water level in the tank by controlling the valve that refills the tank. Shown are:\n\n*Two inputs (from the low and high level switches) represented by contacts of the float switches\n*An output to the fill valve, labelled as the fill valve which it controls\n*An \"internal\" contact, representing the output signal to the fill valve which is created in the program.\n*A logical control scheme created by the interconnection of these items in software\n\nIn ladder diagram, the contact symbols represent the state of bits in processor memory, which corresponds to the state of physical inputs to the system. If a discrete input is energized, the memory bit is a 1, and a \"normally open\" contact controlled by that bit will pass a logic \"true\" signal on to the next element of the ladder. Therefore, the contacts in the PLC program that \"read\" or look at the physical switch contacts in this case must be \"opposite\" or open in order to return a TRUE for the closed physical switches. Internal status bits, corresponding to the state of discrete outputs, are also available to the program.\n\nIn the example, the physical state of the float switch contacts must be considered when choosing \"normally open\" or \"normally closed\" symbols in the ladder diagram. The PLC has two discrete inputs from [[float switch]]es (Low Level and High Level). Both float switches (normally closed) open their contacts when the water level in the tank is above the physical location of the switch.\n\nWhen the water level is below both switches, the float switch physical contacts are both closed, and a true (logic 1) value is passed to the Fill Valve output. Water begins to fill the tank. The internal \"Fill Valve\" contact latches the circuit so that even when the \"Low Level\" contact opens (as the water passes the lower switch), the fill valve remains on. Since the High Level is also normally closed, water continues to flow as the water level remains between the two switch levels. Once the water level rises enough so that the \"High Level\" switch is off (opened), the PLC will shut the inlet to stop the water from overflowing; this is an example of seal-in (latching) logic. The output is sealed in until a high level condition breaks the circuit. After that the fill valve remains off until the level drops so low that the Low Level switch is activated, and the process repeats again.\n<pre style=\"width: 95%;\">\n\n| (N.C. physical   (N.C. physical                             |\n|   Switch)          Switch)                                  |\n|   Low Level       High Level                Fill Valve      |\n|------[ ]------|------[ ]----------------------(OUT)---------|\n|               |                                             |\n|               |                                             |\n|               |                                             |\n|   Fill Valve  |                                             |\n|------[ ]------|                                             |\n|                                                             |\n|                                                             |\n</pre>\n\nA complete program may contain thousands of rungs, evaluated in sequence. Typically the PLC processor will alternately scan all its inputs and update outputs, then evaluate the ladder logic; input changes during a program scan will not be effective until the next I/O update. A complete program scan may take only a few milliseconds, much faster than changes in the controlled process.\n\nProgrammable controllers vary in their capabilities for a \"rung\" of a ladder diagram. Some only allow a single output bit. There are typically limits to the number of series contacts in line, and the number of branches that can be used. Each element of the rung is evaluated sequentially. If elements change their state during evaluation of a rung, hard-to-diagnose faults can be generated, although sometimes (as above) the technique is useful. Some implementations forced evaluation from left-to-right as displayed and did not allow reverse flow of a logic signal (in multi-branched rungs) to affect the output.\n\n==Functionality==\n[[Image:PLC Control Panel.png|thumbnail|350|Control panel with PLC (grey elements in the center). The unit consists of separate elements, from left to right; [[power supply]], controller, [[relay]] units for in- and output]]\n[[File:Control-panel-plc.jpg|thumb|Control panel with a PLC user interface for [[thermal oxidiser|thermal oxidizer]] regulation.]]\nThe main difference from most other computing devices is that PLCs are intended-for and therefore tolerant-of more severe conditions (such as dust, moisture, heat, cold), while offering extensive [[input/output]] (I/O) to connect the PLC to [[sensor]]s and [[actuator]]s. PLC input can include simple digital elements such as [[limit switch]]es, analog variables from process sensors (such as temperature and pressure), and more complex data such as that from positioning or [[machine vision]] systems.<ref>Harms, Toni M. & Kinner, Russell H. P.E., ''Enhancing PLC Performance with Vision Systems''. 18th Annual ESD/HMI International Programmable Controllers Conference Proceedings, 1989, p. 387-399.</ref> PLC output can include elements such as indicator lamps, sirens, [[electric motor]]s, [[pneumatic]] or [[hydraulic]] cylinders, magnetic [[relay]]s, [[solenoid]]s, or [[analog signal|analog]] outputs. The input/output arrangements may be built into a simple PLC, or the PLC may have external [[I/O module]]s attached to a fieldbus or computer network that plugs into the PLC.\n\nThe functionality of the PLC has evolved over the years to include sequential relay control, motion control, [[process control]], [[distributed control system]]s, and [[computer network|networking]]. The data handling, storage, processing power, and communication capabilities of some modern PLCs are approximately equivalent to [[desktop computer]]s. PLC-like programming combined with remote I/O hardware, allow a general-purpose desktop computer to overlap some PLCs in certain applications. Desktop computer controllers have not been generally accepted in heavy industry because the desktop computers run on less stable operating systems than PLCs, and because the desktop computer hardware is typically not designed to the same levels of tolerance to temperature, humidity, vibration, and longevity as the processors used in PLCs. Operating systems such as Windows do not lend themselves to deterministic logic execution, with the result that the controller may not always respond to changes of input status with the consistency in timing expected from PLCs. Desktop logic applications find use in less critical situations, such as laboratory automation and use in small facilities where the application is less demanding and critical.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\n===Basic functions===\n\nThe most basic function of a programmable controller is to emulate the functions of electro-mechanical relays. Discrete inputs are given a unique address, and a PLC instruction can test if the input state is on or off. Just as a series of relay contacts perform a logical AND function, not allowing current to pass unless all the contacts are closed, so a series of \"examine if on\" instructions will energize its output storage bit if all the input bits are on. Similarly, a parallel set of instructions will perform a logical OR. In an electro-mechanical relay wiring diagram, a group of contacts controlling one coil is called a \"rung\" of a \"ladder diagram \", and this concept is also used to describe PLC logic.  Some models of PLC limit the number of series and parallel instructions in one \"rung\" of logic. The output of each rung sets or clears a storage bit, which may be associated with a physical output address or which may be an \"internal coil\" with no physical connection. Such internal coils can be used, for example, as a common element in multiple separate rungs.  Unlike physical relays, there is usually no limit to the number of times an input, output or internal coil can be referenced in a PLC program.\n\nSome PLCs enforce a strict left-to-right, top-to-bottom execution order for evaluating the rung logic.  This is different from electro-mechanical relay contacts, which in a sufficiently complex circuit may either pass current left-to-right or right-to-left, depending on the configuration of surrounding contacts.  The elimination of these \"sneak paths\" is either a bug or a feature, depending on programming style.\n\nMore advanced instructions of the PLC may be implemented as functional blocks, which carry out some operation when enabled by a logical input and which produce outputs to signal, for example, completion or errors, while manipulating variable internally that may not correspond to discrete logic.\n\n=== Communication ===\nPLCs use built-in ports, such as [[USB]], [[Ethernet]], [[RS-232]], [[RS-485]], or [[RS-422]] to communicate with external devices (sensors, actuators) and systems (programming software, [[SCADA]], [[User interface|HMI]]). Communication is carried over various industrial network protocols, like [[Modbus]], or [[EtherNet/IP]]. Many of these protocols are vendor specific.\n\nPLCs used in larger I/O systems may have [[peer-to-peer]] (P2P) communication between processors. This allows separate parts of a complex process to have individual control while allowing the subsystems to co-ordinate over the communication link. These communication links are also often used for [[User interface|HMI]] devices such as keypads or [[Personal computer|PC]]-type workstations.\n\nFormerly, some manufacturers offered dedicated communication modules as an add-on function where the processor had no network connection built-in.\n\n===User interface===\n{{See also|User interface|List of human-computer interaction topics}}\nPLCs may need to interact with people for the purpose of configuration, alarm reporting, or everyday control. A [[SCADA#Human-machine interface|human-machine interface]] (HMI) is employed for this purpose. HMIs are also referred to as man-machine interfaces (MMIs) and graphical user interfaces (GUIs). A simple system may use buttons and lights to interact with the user. Text displays are available as well as graphical touch screens. More complex systems use programming and monitoring software installed on a computer, with the PLC connected via a communication interface.\n\n==Process of a scan cycle==\n\nThere are 5 main steps in a scan cycle:\n\n# Reading inputs\n# Executing the program\n# Processing communication requests\n# Executing CPU diagnostics\n# Writing outputs\n\nA PLC program generally loops i.e. executes repeatedly, as long as the controlled system is running. At the start of each execution loop, the status of all physical inputs are copied to an area of memory, sometimes called the \"I/O Image Table\", which is accessible to the processor. The program then runs from its first instruction rung down to the last rung. It takes some time for the processor of the PLC to evaluate all the rungs and update the I/O image table with the status of outputs.<ref>Maher, Michael J. ''Real-Time Control and Communications''. 18th Annual ESD/SMI International Programmable Controllers Conference Proceedings, 1989, p. 431-436.</ref> Scan times of a few milliseconds may be encountered for small programs and fast processors, but for older processors and very large programs much longer scan times (on the order of 100 ms) may be encountered. Excessively long scan times may mean the response of the PLC to changing inputs or process conditions is too slow to be useful.\n\nAs PLCs became more advanced, methods were developed to change the sequence of ladder execution, and subroutines were implemented.<ref>Kinner, Russell H., P.E. ''Designing Programmable Controller Application Programs Using More than One Designer''. 14th Annual International Programmable Controllers Conference Proceedings, 1985, p. 97-110.</ref> This enhanced programming could be used to save scan time for high-speed processes; for example, parts of the program used only for setting up the machine could be segregated from those parts required to operate at higher speed. Newer PLCs now have the option to run the logic program synchronously with the IO scanning. This means that IO is updated in the background and the logic reads and writes values as required during the logic scanning.\n\nSpecial-purpose I/O modules may be used where the scan time of the PLC is too long to allow predictable performance. Precision timing modules, or counter modules for use with [[rotary encoder|shaft encoder]]s, are used where the scan time would be too long to reliably count pulses or detect the sense of rotation of an encoder. This allows even a relatively slow PLC to still interpret the counted values to control a machine, as the accumulation of pulses is done by a dedicated module that is unaffected by the speed of program execution on the PLC.\n\n==Security==\nPrior to the discovery of the [[Stuxnet]] [[computer worm]] in June 2010, security of PLCs received little attention. Modern PLCs generally contain a real-time operating systems, which can be vulnerable to exploits in similar way as desktop operating systems, like [[Microsoft Windows]]. PLCs can also be attacked by gaining control of a computer they communicate with.<ref name=\":5\">{{cite web |url=http://www.tofinosecurity.com/blog/plc-security-risk-controller-operating-systems |title=PLC Security Risk: Controller Operating Systems - Tofino Industrial Security Solution|website=www.tofinosecurity.com  |date=May 2011 |author=Byres}}</ref> {{As of|2011||since=y}}, this concerns grow as networking is becoming more commonplace in the PLC environment connecting the previously separate plant floor networks and office networks.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bolton|2015|p=15}}</ref>\n\n== Safety PLC ==\nIn recent years \"safety\" PLCs have started to become popular, either as standalone models or as functionality and safety-rated hardware added to existing controller architectures ([[Allen-Bradley]] Guardlogix, [[Siemens]] F-series etc.). These differ from conventional PLC types as being suitable for use in safety-critical applications for which PLCs have traditionally been supplemented with hard-wired [[Safety relay|safety relays]]. For example, a safety PLC might be used to control access to a robot cell with [[Trapped key interlocking|trapped-key access]], or perhaps to manage the shutdown response to an emergency stop on a conveyor production line. Such PLCs typically have a restricted regular instruction set augmented with safety-specific instructions designed to interface with emergency stops, light screens, and so forth. The flexibility that such systems offer has resulted in rapid growth of demand for these controllers.\n\n==PLC compared with other control systems==\n[[File:BMA Automation Allen Bradley PLC 3.JPG|thumb|200px|right|PLC installed in a control panel]]\n[[File:Control-panel.jpg|thumb|Control center with a PLC for a [[Regenerative thermal oxidiser|RTO]].]]\nPLCs are well adapted to a range of [[automation]] tasks. These are typically industrial processes in manufacturing where the cost of developing and maintaining the automation system is high relative to the total cost of the automation, and where changes to the system would be expected during its operational life. PLCs contain input and output devices compatible with industrial pilot devices and controls; little electrical design is required, and the design problem centers on expressing the desired sequence of operations. PLC applications are typically highly customized systems, so the cost of a packaged PLC is low compared to the cost of a specific custom-built controller design. On the other hand, in the case of mass-produced goods, customized control systems are economical. This is due to the lower cost of the components, which can be optimally chosen instead of a \"generic\" solution, and where the non-recurring engineering charges are spread over thousands or millions of units.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nProgrammable controllers are widely used in motion, positioning, or torque control. Some manufacturers produce motion control units to be integrated with PLC so that [[G-code]] (involving a [[CNC]] machine) can be used to instruct machine movements.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Vosough and Vosough|date=November 2011|title=PLC and its Applications|url=http://www.ijmse.org/Volume2/Issue8/paper9.pdf|journal=International Journal of Multidisciplinary Sciences and Engineering|volume=2|pages=}}</ref>{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}\n\n=== Cam timers ===\nFor high volume or very simple fixed automation tasks, different techniques are used. For example, a cheap consumer [[dishwasher]] would be controlled by an electromechanical [[cam timer]] costing only a few dollars in production quantities.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\n=== Microcontrollers ===\nA [[microcontroller]]-based design would be appropriate where hundreds or thousands of units will be produced and so the development cost (design of power supplies, input/output hardware, and necessary testing and certification) can be spread over many sales, and where the end-user would not need to alter the control. Automotive applications are an example; millions of units are built each year, and very few end-users alter the programming of these controllers. However, some specialty vehicles such as transit buses economically use PLCs instead of custom-designed controls, because the volumes are low and the development cost would be uneconomical.<ref name=\"McMillan992\">Gregory K. McMillan, Douglas M. Considine (ed), ''Process/Industrial Instruments and Controls Handbook Fifth Edition'', McGraw-Hill, 1999 {{ISBN|0-07-012582-1}} Section 3 ''Controllers''</ref>\n\n=== Single-board computers ===\nVery complex process control, such as used in the chemical industry, may require algorithms and performance beyond the capability of even high-performance PLCs. Very high-speed or precision controls may also require customized solutions; for example, aircraft flight controls. [[Single-board computer|Single-board computers]] using semi-customized or fully proprietary hardware may be chosen for very demanding control applications where the high development and maintenance cost can be supported. \"Soft PLCs\" running on desktop-type computers can interface with industrial I/O hardware while executing programs within a version of commercial operating systems adapted for process control needs.<ref name=\"McMillan992\" />\n\nThe rising popularity of [[Single-board computer|single board computers]] has also had an influence on the development of PLCs. Traditional PLCs are generally [[Closed platform|closed platforms]], but some newer PLCs (e.g. ctrlX from [[Bosch Rexroth]], PFC200 from [[WAGO Kontakttechnik|Wago]], PLCnext from [[Phoenix Contact]], and Revolution Pi from Kunbus) provide the features of traditional PLCs on an [[open platform]].\n\n=== PID Controllers ===\nPLCs may include logic for single-variable feedback analog control loop, a [[PID controller]]. A PID loop could be used to control the temperature of a manufacturing process, for example. Historically PLCs were usually configured with only a few analog control loops; where processes required hundreds or thousands of loops, a [[distributed control system]] (DCS) would instead be used. As PLCs have become more powerful, the boundary between DCS and PLC applications has been blurred.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}\n\n===Programmable logic relays (PLR)===\n{{Original research section|date=March 2020}}In more recent years,{{When|date=February 2020}} small products called programmable logic relays (PLRs) or smart relays, have become more common and accepted. These are similar to PLCs and are used in light industry where only a few points of I/O are needed, and low cost is desired. These small devices are typically made in a common physical size and shape by several manufacturers, and branded by the makers of larger PLCs to fill out their low end product range. Most of these have 8 to 12 discrete inputs, 4 to 8 discrete outputs, and up to 2 analog inputs. Most such devices include a tiny postage-stamp-sized LCD screen for viewing simplified ladder logic (only a very small portion of the program being visible at a given time) and status of I/O points, and typically these screens are accompanied by a 4-way rocker push-button plus four more separate push-buttons, similar to the key buttons on a VCR remote control, and used to navigate and edit the logic. Most have a small plug for connecting via RS-232 or RS-485 to a personal computer so that programmers can use simple Windows applications for programming instead of being forced to use the tiny LCD and push-button set for this purpose. Unlike regular PLCs that are usually modular and greatly expandable, the PLRs are usually not modular or expandable, but their price can be two [[orders of magnitude]] less than a PLC, and they still offer robust design and deterministic execution of the logics.\n\nA variant of PLCs, used in remote locations is the [[remote terminal unit]] or RTU. An RTU is typically a low power, ruggedised PLC whose key function is to manage the communications links between the site and the central control system (typically [[SCADA]]) or in some modern systems, \"The Cloud\". Unlike factory automation using high speed [[Ethernet]], communications links to remote sites are often radio based and are less reliable. To account for the reduced reliability, RTU will buffer messages or switch to alternate communications paths. When buffering messages, the RTU will timestamp each message so that a full history of site events can be reconstructed. RTUs, being PLCs, have a wide range of I/O and are fully programmable, typically with languages from the [[IEC 61131-3]] standard that is common to many PLCs, RTUs and DCSs. In remote locations, it is common to use an RTU as a gateway for a PLC, where the PLC is performing all site control and the RTU is managing communications, time stamping events and monitoring ancillary equipment. On sites with only a handful of I/O, the RTU may also be the site PLC and will perform both communications and control functions.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Industrial control systems]]\n* [[Industrial safety systems]]\n* [[PLC technician]]\n* [[1-bit architecture]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n{{Refbegin|}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Bolton|first=William|url=https://books.google.pl/books?id=sDqnBQAAQBAJ|title=Programmable Logic Controllers|publisher=Newnes|year=2015|isbn=9780081003534|edition=6th, revised|location=|ref=harv|via=Google Books}}\n\n{{Refend}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Daniel Kandray, ''Programmable Automation Technologies'', Industrial Press, 2010 {{ISBN|978-0-8311-3346-7}}, Chapter 8 ''Introduction to Programmable Logic Controllers''\n* Tom Mejer Antonsen, 2018 \"PLC Controls with Structured Text (ST)\", {{ISBN|978-87-4300-241-3}},  {{ISBN|978-87-4300-242-0}}\n* {{cite book |title=The Programmable Logic Controller: its prehistory, emergence and application |author-first=Mark John |author-last=Walker |date=2012-09-08 |type=PhD thesis |location=Department of Communication and Systems Faculty of Mathematics, Computing and Technology |publisher=[[The Open University]] |url=http://oro.open.ac.uk/54687/1/594090.pdf |access-date=2018-06-20 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180620115412/http://oro.open.ac.uk/54687/1/594090.pdf |archive-date=2018-06-20}}\n\n== External links ==\n*[https://www.solisplc.com/what-is-plc-programming Complete PLC Programming Guide for Beginners]\n*[http://plccompare.com/embedded-plc-guide/ A simple guide to Embedded PLCs]\n\n{{Commons category|Programmable logic controller}}\n{{Wikiversity|Programmable logic controller (basics)}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Programmable Logic Controller}}\n[[Category:Industrial automation]]\n[[Category:Industrial computing]]\n[[Category:Programmable logic controllers]]\n[[Category:Wikipedia articles with ASCII art]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:Siemens Simatic S7-416-3.jpg|thumb|upright|PLC system in a rack, left-to-right: power supply unit (PSU), CPU, interface module (IM) and communication processor (CP).]]\n{{Manufacturing}}\n\nA '''programmable logic controller''' ('''PLC''') or '''programmable controller''' is an industrial [[digital computer]] which has been [[Rugged computer|ruggedized]] and adapted for the control of manufacturing processes, such as [[Assembly line|assembly lines]], or [[robotic]] devices, or any activity that requires high reliability, ease of programming and process fault diagnosis.\n\nPLCs can range from small modular devices with tens of [[Input/output|inputs and outputs (I/O)]], in a housing integral with the processor, to large rack-mounted modular devices with a count of thousands of I/O, and which are often networked to other PLC and [[SCADA]] systems.\n\nThey can be designed for many arrangements of digital and analog I/O, extended temperature ranges, immunity to [[Noise (electronics)|electrical noise]], and resistance to vibration and impact. Programs to control machine operation are typically stored in battery-backed-up or [[non-volatile memory]].\n\nPLCs were first developed in the automobile manufacturing industry to provide flexible, rugged and easily programmable controllers to replace hard-wired [[relay logic]] systems. Since then, they have been widely adopted as high-reliability automation controllers suitable for harsh environments.\n\nA PLC is an example of a \"hard\" [[Real-time computing|real-time]] system since output results must be produced in response to input conditions within a limited time, otherwise unintended operation will result.\n\n==Invention and early development==\nPLC originated in the late 1960s in the automotive industry in the USA and were designed to replace relay logic systems.<ref name=\":3\" /> Before, control logic for manufacturing was mainly composed of [[Relay|relays]], [[Cam timer|cam timers]], [[Drum sequencer (controller)|drum sequencers]], and dedicated closed-loop controllers. \n\nThe hard-wired nature made it difficult for design engineers to alter the process. Changes would require rewiring and careful updating of the documentation. If even one wire were out of place, or one relay failed, the whole system would become faulty. Often times technicians would spend hours troubleshooting by examining the schematics and comparing them to existing wiring.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.controlsystemsandautomation.com/learn/plc/plc-programming-basics-i/|title=PLC Programming Basics Part I|date=2019-07-23|website=Control Systems & Automation|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-23}}</ref> When general-purpose computers became available, they were soon applied to control sequential and combinatorial logic in industrial processes.{{Fact|date=February 2020}} These early computers required specialist programmers and strict control of working conditions, such as temperature, cleanliness, and power quality.{{Fact|date=February 2020}} \n\nThe PLC was developed with several advantages over earlier designs. It tolerated the industrial environment better than computers and was more reliable, compact and required less maintenance than relay systems. It was easily extensible with additional I/O modules, while relay systems required complicated hardware changes in case of reconfiguration. This allowed for easier iteration over manufacturing process design. Comparing to a computer, PLC in a rack format can be more easily extended with additional I/O in the form of I/O cards.

As programming terminals evolved, it became more common for ladder logic to be used, because it was a familiar format used for electro-mechanical control panels. Newer formats, such as state logic and Function Block (which is similar to the way logic is depicted when using digital integrated logic circuits) exist, but they are still{{When|date=February 2020}} not as popular as ladder logic. A primary reason for this is that PLCs solve the logic in a predictable and repeating sequence, and ladder logic allows the person writing the logic to see any issues with the timing of the logic sequence more easily than would be possible in other formats.{{Fact|date=February 2020}}\n\nUp to the mid-1990s, PLCs were programmed using proprietary programming panels or special-purpose programming [[Computer terminal|terminals]], which often had dedicated function keys representing the various logical elements of PLC programs.<ref name=\"EERef162\" /> Some proprietary programming terminals displayed the elements of PLC programs as graphic symbols, but plain [[ASCII art|ASCII]] character representations of contacts, coils, and wires were common. Programs were stored on [[Cassette tape cartridge|cassette tape cartridges]]. Facilities for printing and documentation were minimal due to lack of memory capacity. The oldest PLCs used [[non-volatile]] [[magnetic core memory]].\n\n== Architecture ==\nRegular programmable logic controller consists of:\n\n* a processor unit (CPU) which interprets inputs, executes the control program stored in memory and sends output signals,\n* a power supply unit which converts AC voltage to DC,\n* a memory unit storing data from inputs and program to be executed by the processor,\n* an input and output interfaces, where the controller receives and sends data from/to external devices,\n* a communications interface to receive and transmit data on communication networks from/to remote PLCs.<ref name=\":4\">{{Harvnb|Bolton|2015|p=7}}</ref>\n\nPLCs require programming device which is used to develop and later download the created program into the memory of the controller.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nModern PLCs generally contain a [[real-time operating system]], such as [[OS-9]] or [[VxWorks]].<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n===Mechanical design===\n[[File:Siemens_sps_logo_8_12-24_RCE-03.jpg|thumb|Compact PLC with 8 inputs and 4 outputs.]]\n[[File:PLC_AB_InstaladoV1.JPG|alt=Modular PLC with EtherNet/IP module, digital and analog I/O, with some slots being empty.|thumb|Modular PLC with [[EtherNet/IP]] module, discrete and analog I/O, with some slots being empty.]]\nThere are two types of mechanical design for PLC systems. A ''single box'', or a ''brick'' is a small programmable controller that fits all units and interfaces into one compact casing, although, typically, additional expansion modules for inputs and outputs are available. Second design type \u2013 a ''modular'' PLC \u2013 has a chassis (also called a ''rack'') that provides space for modules with different functions, such as power supply, processor, selection of I/O modules and communication interfaces \u2013 which all can be customized for the particular application.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bolton|2015|pp=12\u201313}}</ref> Several racks can be administered by a single processor, and may have thousands of inputs and outputs. Either a special high speed serial I/O link or comparable communication method is used so that racks can be distributed away from the processor, reducing the wiring costs for large plants. Options are also available to mount I/O points directly to the machine and utilize quick disconnecting cables to sensors and valves, saving time for wiring and replacing components.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n===Discrete (digital) and analog signals===\n{{Overly detailed|section|details=an excessive explanations of scaling of values|date=April 2020}}\n[[Digital signal|Discrete (digital) signals]] behave as binary switches, yielding simply an On or Off signal (1 or 0, True or False, respectively). Push buttons, [[limit switch]]es, and [[photoelectric sensor]]s are examples of devices providing a discrete signal. Discrete signals are sent using either [[voltage]] or [[current (electricity)|current]], where a specific range is designated as ''On'' and another as ''Off''. For example, a PLC might use 24 V DC I/O, with values above 22 V DC representing ''On'', values below 2VDC representing ''Off'', and intermediate values undefined. Initially, PLCs had only digital I/O.\n\nAnalog signals are like volume controls, with a range of values between zero and full-scale. These are typically interpreted as integer values (counts) by the PLC, with various ranges of accuracy depending on the device and the number of bits available to store the data. As PLCs typically use 16-bit signed binary processors, the integer values are limited between -32,768 and +32,767. Pressure, temperature, flow, and weight are often represented by analog signals. Analog signals can use [[voltage]] or [[current (electricity)|current]] with a magnitude proportional to the value of the process signal. For example, an analog 0 to 10&nbsp;V or [[4-20 mA]] input would be [[analog-to-digital converter|converted]] into an integer value of 0 to 32767.  The programming inside the PLC will use a SCL or scaling function to take this 0-32767 value and transpose it into the desired units of the process so the operator or program can read it.  Proper integration will also include filter times to reduce noise as well as high and low limits to report faults.\n\n[[Current loop|Current inputs]] are less sensitive to electrical noise (e.g. from welders or electric motor starts) than voltage inputs.  Distance from the device and the controller is also a concern as the maximum travelling distance of a good quality 0-10V signal is very short compared to the 4-20mA signal.  The 4-20mA signal can also report if the wire is disconnected along the path as it would return a 0mA signal and a fault can be reported.\n\n===Timers and counters===\n{{Overly detailed|section|details=an excessive explanation of types of timers|date=April 2020}}\nThe main function of a timer is to keep an output on for a specific length of time.  A good example of this is a garage light, where you want power to be cut off after 2 minutes so as to give someone time to go into the house. The three different types of timers that are commonly used are a Delay-OFF, a Delay-ON, and a Delay-ON-Retentive. A Delay-OFF timer activates immediately when turned on, and will start counting down from a programmed time before cutting off once the enabling input is off. A Delay-ON timer is activated by input and starts accumulating time, counts up to a programmed time before cutting off, and is cleared when the enabling input is turned off. A Delay-ON-Retentive timer is activated by input and starts accumulating time, retains the accumulated value even if the (ladder-logic) rung goes false, and can be reset only by a RESET command.  Visible details for the rest of the program to use could include:\n\n*EN - ENable signal, indicated the timer has been enabled and can start timing, or if completed keep the DoNe status on.\n*PRE - PREset time, requested time value to be run before the timer is DoNe.  Could be in a TIME format (t#1h35m12s) or in seconds format (3500 = 3.5s)\n*ACC - ACCumulated time, how long the timer has been timing.  Same number formats as the PREset value.\n*DN - DoNe signal, indicates the timer has elapsed the preset value\n*TT - Timer Timing signal, indicates the timer is actively timing.  This is not on once the timer is done\n\nCounters are primarily used for counting items such as cans going into a box on an assembly line. This is important because once something is filled to its max the item needs to be moved on so something else can be filled. Many companies use counters in PLC's to count boxes, count how many feet of something is covered, or to count how many pallets are on a truck.  There are three types of counters, Up counters, Down counters, and Up/Down counters. Up counters count up to the preset value, turn on the CTU (CounT Up output) when the preset value is reached, and are cleared upon receiving a reset.  Down counters count down from a preset value, turns on the CTD (CounT Down output) when 0 is reached, and are cleared upon reset. Up/Down counters count up on CU, count down on CD, turn on CTUD (CounT Up/Down output) when the preset value is reached, and cleared on reset.<ref>Yanik, P. (2017, April 11). Timers and Counters. Cullowhee, NC, United States of America.</ref>\n\n===Redundancy===\nSome special processes need to work permanently with minimum unwanted down time. Therefore, it is necessary to design a system which is fault-tolerant and capable of handling the process with faulty modules. In such cases to increase the system availability in the event of hardware component failure, redundant CPU or I/O modules with the same functionality can be added to hardware configuration for preventing total or partial process shutdown due to hardware failure.  Other redundancy scenarios  could be related to safety critical processes, for example large hydraulic presses could require that both PLCs turn on an output before the press can come down in case one output does not turn off properly.\n\n==Programming==\n[[File:Automate industriel WAGO pour un syst\u00e8me de monitoring en industrie pharmaceutique.jpg|thumb|Industrial controller for a monitoring system in the pharmaceutical industry]]\nProgrammable logic controllers are intended to be used by engineers without programming background. For this reason, graphical programming language called [[Ladder logic|Ladder Diagram]] (LD, LAD) was first developed which resembles the schematic diagram of a system built with electromechanical relays. It was adopted by many manufacturers and later standardized in the [[IEC 61131-3]] control systems programming standard. {{As of|2015|}}, it is still widely used, thanks to its simplicity.<ref name=\":6\">{{Harvnb|Bolton|2015|pp=16\u201318}}</ref>\n\n{{As of|2015|}}, the majority of PLC systems adhere to the [[IEC 61131-3]] standard that defines 2 textual programming languages: [[Structured text|Structured Text]] (ST; similar to [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]]) and [[Instruction list|Instruction List]] (IL); as well as 3 graphical languages: [[Ladder logic|Ladder Diagram]], [[Function block diagram|Function Block Diagram]] (FBD) and [[Sequential function chart|Sequential Function Chart]] (SFC).<ref name=\":6\" /><ref>Keller, William L Jr. ''Grafcet, A Functional Chart for Sequential Processes'', 14th Annual International Programmable Controllers Conference Proceedings, 1984, p. 71-96.</ref> [[Instruction list|Instruction List]] (IL) was deprecated in the third edition of the standard.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://plcopen.org/status-iec-61131-3-standard|title=Status IEC 61131-3 standard|last=|first=|date=2018-07-19|website=PLCopen|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-01}}</ref>\n\nModern PLCs can be programmed in a variety of ways, from the relay-derived ladder logic to programming languages such as specially adapted dialects of [[BASIC]] and [[C (programming language)|C]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}\n\nWhile the fundamental concepts of PLC programming are common to all manufacturers, differences in I/O addressing, memory organization, and instruction sets mean that PLC programs are never perfectly interchangeable between different makers. Even within the same product line of a single manufacturer, different models may not be directly compatible.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}\n\nPLC programs are typically written in programming device which can take form of a desktop console, a special software on a [[personal computer]], or a handheld programming device.<ref name=\":7\">{{Harvnb|Bolton|2015|pp=19\u201320}}</ref> Then, the program is downloaded to the PLC directly or over a network. It is stored either in non-volatile [[flash memory]] or battery-backed-up [[RAM]]. In some programmable controllers, the program is transferred from a personal computer to the PLC through a programming board which writes the program into a removable chip, such as [[EPROM]].\n\nProgram written on personal computer can be easily copied and backed up on external storage. Manufacturers develop programming software for their controllers. In addition to being able to program PLCs in multiple languages, they provide common features like hardware diagnostics and maintenance, software debugging, and offline simulation.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nThe program can be uploaded for backup and restoration purposes.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}\n\n===Simulation===\nIn order to properly understand the operation of a PLC, it is necessary to spend considerable time [[Computer programming|programming]], testing and [[debugging]] PLC programs. PLC systems are inherently expensive, and down-time is often very costly. In addition, if a PLC is programmed incorrectly it can result in lost productivity and dangerous conditions. PLC simulation software such as PLCLogix can save time in the design of automated control applications and can also increase the level of safety associated with equipment since many \"what if\" scenarios can be tried and tested before the system is activated.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Lin|first1=Sally|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CHYlTBxqrM8C&pg=PA553|title=Advances in Computer Science, Environment, Ecoinformatics, and Education, Part III: International Conference, CSEE 2011, Wuhan, China, August 21-22, 2011.

A ladder diagram is a method of drawing control circuits which pre-dates PLCs. The ladder diagram resembles the schematic diagram of a system built with electromechanical relays.\n\nAs an example, say a facility needs to store water in a tank. The water is drawn from the tank by another system, as needed, and our example system must manage the water level in the tank by controlling the valve that refills the tank. Shown are:\n\n*Two inputs (from the low and high level switches) represented by contacts of the float switches\n*An output to the fill valve, labelled as the fill valve which it controls\n*An \"internal\" contact, representing the output signal to the fill valve which is created in the program.\n*A logical control scheme created by the interconnection of these items in software\n\nIn ladder diagram, the contact symbols represent the state of bits in processor memory, which corresponds to the state of physical inputs to the system. If a discrete input is energized, the memory bit is a 1, and a \"normally open\" contact controlled by that bit will pass a logic \"true\" signal on to the next element of the ladder. Therefore, the contacts in the PLC program that \"read\" or look at the physical switch contacts in this case must be \"opposite\" or open in order to return a TRUE for the closed physical switches. Internal status bits, corresponding to the state of discrete outputs, are also available to the program.\n\nIn the example, the physical state of the float switch contacts must be considered when choosing \"normally open\" or \"normally closed\" symbols in the ladder diagram. The PLC has two discrete inputs from [[float switch]]es (Low Level and High Level). Both float switches (normally closed) open their contacts when the water level in the tank is above the physical location of the switch.\n\nWhen the water level is below both switches, the float switch physical contacts are both closed, and a true (logic 1) value is passed to the Fill Valve output. Water begins to fill the tank. The internal \"Fill Valve\" contact latches the circuit so that even when the \"Low Level\" contact opens (as the water passes the lower switch), the fill valve remains on. Since the High Level is also normally closed, water continues to flow as the water level remains between the two switch levels. Once the water level rises enough so that the \"High Level\" switch is off (opened), the PLC will shut the inlet to stop the water from overflowing; this is an example of seal-in (latching) logic. The output is sealed in until a high level condition breaks the circuit. After that the fill valve remains off until the level drops so low that the Low Level switch is activated, and the process repeats again.\n<pre style=\"width: 95%;\">\n\n| (N.C. physical   (N.C. physical                             |\n|   Switch)          Switch)                                  |\n|   Low Level       High Level                Fill Valve      |\n|------[ ]------|------[ ]----------------------(OUT)---------|\n|               |                                             |\n|               |                                             |\n|               |                                             |\n|   Fill Valve  |                                             |\n|------[ ]------|                                             |\n|                                                             |\n|                                                             |\n</pre>\n\nA complete program may contain thousands of rungs, evaluated in sequence. Typically the PLC processor will alternately scan all its inputs and update outputs, then evaluate the ladder logic; input changes during a program scan will not be effective until the next I/O update. A complete program scan may take only a few milliseconds, much faster than changes in the controlled process.\n\nProgrammable controllers vary in their capabilities for a \"rung\" of a ladder diagram. Some only allow a single output bit. There are typically limits to the number of series contacts in line, and the number of branches that can be used. Each element of the rung is evaluated sequentially. If elements change their state during evaluation of a rung, hard-to-diagnose faults can be generated, although sometimes (as above) the technique is useful. Some implementations forced evaluation from left-to-right as displayed and did not allow reverse flow of a logic signal (in multi-branched rungs) to affect the output.\n\n==Functionality==\n[[Image:PLC Control Panel.png|thumbnail|350|Control panel with PLC (grey elements in the center). The unit consists of separate elements, from left to right; [[power supply]], controller, [[relay]] units for in- and output]]\n[[File:Control-panel-plc.jpg|thumb|Control panel with a PLC user interface for [[thermal oxidiser|thermal oxidizer]] regulation.]]\nThe main difference from most other computing devices is that PLCs are intended-for and therefore tolerant-of more severe conditions (such as dust, moisture, heat, cold), while offering extensive [[input/output]] (I/O) to connect the PLC to [[sensor]]s and [[actuator]]s. PLC input can include simple digital elements such as [[limit switch]]es, analog variables from process sensors (such as temperature and pressure), and more complex data such as that from positioning or [[machine vision]] systems.<ref>Harms, Toni M. & Kinner, Russell H. P.E., ''Enhancing PLC Performance with Vision Systems''. 18th Annual ESD/HMI International Programmable Controllers Conference Proceedings, 1989, p. 387-399.</ref> PLC output can include elements such as indicator lamps, sirens, [[electric motor]]s, [[pneumatic]] or [[hydraulic]] cylinders, magnetic [[relay]]s, [[solenoid]]s, or [[analog signal|analog]] outputs. The input/output arrangements may be built into a simple PLC, or the PLC may have external [[I/O module]]s attached to a fieldbus or computer network that plugs into the PLC.\n\nThe functionality of the PLC has evolved over the years to include sequential relay control, motion control, [[process control]], [[distributed control system]]s, and [[computer network|networking]]. The data handling, storage, processing power, and communication capabilities of some modern PLCs are approximately equivalent to [[desktop computer]]s. PLC-like programming combined with remote I/O hardware, allow a general-purpose desktop computer to overlap some PLCs in certain applications. Desktop computer controllers have not been generally accepted in heavy industry because the desktop computers run on less stable operating systems than PLCs, and because the desktop computer hardware is typically not designed to the same levels of tolerance to temperature, humidity, vibration, and longevity as the processors used in PLCs. Operating systems such as Windows do not lend themselves to deterministic logic execution, with the result that the controller may not always respond to changes of input status with the consistency in timing expected from PLCs. Desktop logic applications find use in less critical situations, such as laboratory automation and use in small facilities where the application is less demanding and critical.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\n===Basic functions===\n\nThe most basic function of a programmable controller is to emulate the functions of electro-mechanical relays. Discrete inputs are given a unique address, and a PLC instruction can test if the input state is on or off. Just as a series of relay contacts perform a logical AND function, not allowing current to pass unless all the contacts are closed, so a series of \"examine if on\" instructions will energize its output storage bit if all the input bits are on. Similarly, a parallel set of instructions will perform a logical OR. In an electro-mechanical relay wiring diagram, a group of contacts controlling one coil is called a \"rung\" of a \"ladder diagram \", and this concept is also used to describe PLC logic.  Some models of PLC limit the number of series and parallel instructions in one \"rung\" of logic. The output of each rung sets or clears a storage bit, which may be associated with a physical output address or which may be an \"internal coil\" with no physical connection. Such internal coils can be used, for example, as a common element in multiple separate rungs.  Unlike physical relays, there is usually no limit to the number of times an input, output or internal coil can be referenced in a PLC program.\n\nSome PLCs enforce a strict left-to-right, top-to-bottom execution order for evaluating the rung logic.  This is different from electro-mechanical relay contacts, which in a sufficiently complex circuit may either pass current left-to-right or right-to-left, depending on the configuration of surrounding contacts.  The elimination of these \"sneak paths\" is either a bug or a feature, depending on programming style.\n\nMore advanced instructions of the PLC may be implemented as functional blocks, which carry out some operation when enabled by a logical input and which produce outputs to signal, for example, completion or errors, while manipulating variable internally that may not correspond to discrete logic.\n\n=== Communication ===\nPLCs use built-in ports, such as [[USB]], [[Ethernet]], [[RS-232]], [[RS-485]], or [[RS-422]] to communicate with external devices (sensors, actuators) and systems (programming software, [[SCADA]], [[User interface|HMI]]). Communication is carried over various industrial network protocols, like [[Modbus]], or [[EtherNet/IP]]. Many of these protocols are vendor specific.\n\nPLCs used in larger I/O systems may have [[peer-to-peer]] (P2P) communication between processors. This allows separate parts of a complex process to have individual control while allowing the subsystems to co-ordinate over the communication link. These communication links are also often used for [[User interface|HMI]] devices such as keypads or [[Personal computer|PC]]-type workstations.\n\nFormerly, some manufacturers offered dedicated communication modules as an add-on function where the processor had no network connection built-in.\n\n===User interface===\n{{See also|User interface|List of human-computer interaction topics}}\nPLCs may need to interact with people for the purpose of configuration, alarm reporting, or everyday control. A [[SCADA#Human-machine interface|human-machine interface]] (HMI) is employed for this purpose. HMIs are also referred to as man-machine interfaces (MMIs) and graphical user interfaces (GUIs). A simple system may use buttons and lights to interact with the user. Text displays are available as well as graphical touch screens. More complex systems use programming and monitoring software installed on a computer, with the PLC connected via a communication interface.\n\n==Process of a scan cycle==\n\nThere are 5 main steps in a scan cycle:\n\n# Reading inputs\n# Executing the program\n# Processing communication requests\n# Executing CPU diagnostics\n# Writing outputs\n\nA PLC program generally loops i.e. executes repeatedly, as long as the controlled system is running. At the start of each execution loop, the status of all physical inputs are copied to an area of memory, sometimes called the \"I/O Image Table\", which is accessible to the processor. The program then runs from its first instruction rung down to the last rung. It takes some time for the processor of the PLC to evaluate all the rungs and update the I/O image table with the status of outputs.<ref>Maher, Michael J. ''Real-Time Control and Communications''. 18th Annual ESD/SMI International Programmable Controllers Conference Proceedings, 1989, p. 431-436.</ref> Scan times of a few milliseconds may be encountered for small programs and fast processors, but for older processors and very large programs much longer scan times (on the order of 100 ms) may be encountered. Excessively long scan times may mean the response of the PLC to changing inputs or process conditions is too slow to be useful.\n\nAs PLCs became more advanced, methods were developed to change the sequence of ladder execution, and subroutines were implemented.<ref>Kinner, Russell H., P.E. ''Designing Programmable Controller Application Programs Using More than One Designer''. 14th Annual International Programmable Controllers Conference Proceedings, 1985, p. 97-110.</ref> This enhanced programming could be used to save scan time for high-speed processes; for example, parts of the program used only for setting up the machine could be segregated from those parts required to operate at higher speed. Newer PLCs now have the option to run the logic program synchronously with the IO scanning. This means that IO is updated in the background and the logic reads and writes values as required during the logic scanning.\n\nSpecial-purpose I/O modules may be used where the scan time of the PLC is too long to allow predictable performance. Precision timing modules, or counter modules for use with [[rotary encoder|shaft encoder]]s, are used where the scan time would be too long to reliably count pulses or detect the sense of rotation of an encoder. This allows even a relatively slow PLC to still interpret the counted values to control a machine, as the accumulation of pulses is done by a dedicated module that is unaffected by the speed of program execution on the PLC.\n\n==Security==\nPrior to the discovery of the [[Stuxnet]] [[computer worm]] in June 2010, security of PLCs received little attention. Modern PLCs generally contain a real-time operating systems, which can be vulnerable to exploits in similar way as desktop operating systems, like [[Microsoft Windows]]. PLCs can also be attacked by gaining control of a computer they communicate with.<ref name=\":5\">{{cite web |url=http://www.tofinosecurity.com/blog/plc-security-risk-controller-operating-systems |title=PLC Security Risk: Controller Operating Systems - Tofino Industrial Security Solution|website=www.tofinosecurity.com  |date=May 2011 |author=Byres}}</ref> {{As of|2011||since=y}}, this concerns grow as networking is becoming more commonplace in the PLC environment connecting the previously separate plant floor networks and office networks.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bolton|2015|p=15}}</ref>\n\n== Safety PLC ==\nIn recent years \"safety\" PLCs have started to become popular, either as standalone models or as functionality and safety-rated hardware added to existing controller architectures ([[Allen-Bradley]] Guardlogix, [[Siemens]] F-series etc.). These differ from conventional PLC types as being suitable for use in safety-critical applications for which PLCs have traditionally been supplemented with hard-wired [[Safety relay|safety relays]]. For example, a safety PLC might be used to control access to a robot cell with [[Trapped key interlocking|trapped-key access]], or perhaps to manage the shutdown response to an emergency stop on a conveyor production line. Such PLCs typically have a restricted regular instruction set augmented with safety-specific instructions designed to interface with emergency stops, light screens, and so forth. The flexibility that such systems offer has resulted in rapid growth of demand for these controllers.\n\n==PLC compared with other control systems==\n[[File:BMA Automation Allen Bradley PLC 3.JPG|thumb|200px|right|PLC installed in a control panel]]\n[[File:Control-panel.jpg|thumb|Control center with a PLC for a [[Regenerative thermal oxidiser|RTO]].]]\nPLCs are well adapted to a range of [[automation]] tasks. These are typically industrial processes in manufacturing where the cost of developing and maintaining the automation system is high relative to the total cost of the automation, and where changes to the system would be expected during its operational life. PLCs contain input and output devices compatible with industrial pilot devices and controls; little electrical design is required, and the design problem centers on expressing the desired sequence of operations. PLC applications are typically highly customized systems, so the cost of a packaged PLC is low compared to the cost of a specific custom-built controller design. On the other hand, in the case of mass-produced goods, customized control systems are economical. This is due to the lower cost of the components, which can be optimally chosen instead of a \"generic\" solution, and where the non-recurring engineering charges are spread over thousands or millions of units.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nProgrammable controllers are widely used in motion, positioning, or torque control.

Automotive applications are an example; millions of units are built each year, and very few end-users alter the programming of these controllers. However, some specialty vehicles such as transit buses economically use PLCs instead of custom-designed controls, because the volumes are low and the development cost would be uneconomical.<ref name=\"McMillan992\">Gregory K.

Very high-speed or precision controls may also require customized solutions; for example, aircraft flight controls. [[Single-board computer|Single-board computers]] using semi-customized or fully proprietary hardware may be chosen for very demanding control applications where the high development and maintenance cost can be supported. \"Soft PLCs\" running on desktop-type computers can interface with industrial I/O hardware while executing programs within a version of commercial operating systems adapted for process control needs.<ref name=\"McMillan992\" />\n\nThe rising popularity of [[Single-board computer|single board computers]] has also had an influence on the development of PLCs. Traditional PLCs are generally [[Closed platform|closed platforms]], but some newer PLCs (e.g. ctrlX from [[Bosch Rexroth]], PFC200 from [[WAGO Kontakttechnik|Wago]], PLCnext from [[Phoenix Contact]], and Revolution Pi from Kunbus) provide the features of traditional PLCs on an [[open platform]].\n\n=== PID Controllers ===\nPLCs may include logic for single-variable feedback analog control loop, a [[PID controller]]. A PID loop could be used to control the temperature of a manufacturing process, for example. Historically PLCs were usually configured with only a few analog control loops; where processes required hundreds or thousands of loops, a [[distributed control system]] (DCS) would instead be used. As PLCs have become more powerful, the boundary between DCS and PLC applications has been blurred.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}\n\n===Programmable logic relays (PLR)===\n{{Original research section|date=March 2020}}In more recent years,{{When|date=February 2020}} small products called programmable logic relays (PLRs) or smart relays, have become more common and accepted. These are similar to PLCs and are used in light industry where only a few points of I/O are needed, and low cost is desired. These small devices are typically made in a common physical size and shape by several manufacturers, and branded by the makers of larger PLCs to fill out their low end product range. Most of these have 8 to 12 discrete inputs, 4 to 8 discrete outputs, and up to 2 analog inputs. Most such devices include a tiny postage-stamp-sized LCD screen for viewing simplified ladder logic (only a very small portion of the program being visible at a given time) and status of I/O points, and typically these screens are accompanied by a 4-way rocker push-button plus four more separate push-buttons, similar to the key buttons on a VCR remote control, and used to navigate and edit the logic. Most have a small plug for connecting via RS-232 or RS-485 to a personal computer so that programmers can use simple Windows applications for programming instead of being forced to use the tiny LCD and push-button set for this purpose. Unlike regular PLCs that are usually modular and greatly expandable, the PLRs are usually not modular or expandable, but their price can be two [[orders of magnitude]] less than a PLC, and they still offer robust design and deterministic execution of the logics.\n\nA variant of PLCs, used in remote locations is the [[remote terminal unit]] or RTU. An RTU is typically a low power, ruggedised PLC whose key function is to manage the communications links between the site and the central control system (typically [[SCADA]]) or in some modern systems, \"The Cloud\". Unlike factory automation using high speed [[Ethernet]], communications links to remote sites are often radio based and are less reliable. To account for the reduced reliability, RTU will buffer messages or switch to alternate communications paths. When buffering messages, the RTU will timestamp each message so that a full history of site events can be reconstructed. RTUs, being PLCs, have a wide range of I/O and are fully programmable, typically with languages from the [[IEC 61131-3]] standard that is common to many PLCs, RTUs and DCSs. In remote locations, it is common to use an RTU as a gateway for a PLC, where the PLC is performing all site control and the RTU is managing communications, time stamping events and monitoring ancillary equipment. On sites with only a handful of I/O, the RTU may also be the site PLC and will perform both communications and control functions.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Industrial control systems]]\n* [[Industrial safety systems]]\n* [[PLC technician]]\n* [[1-bit architecture]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n{{Refbegin|}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Bolton|first=William|url=https://books.google.pl/books?id=sDqnBQAAQBAJ|title=Programmable Logic Controllers|publisher=Newnes|year=2015|isbn=9780081003534|edition=6th, revised|location=|ref=harv|via=Google Books}}\n\n{{Refend}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Daniel Kandray, ''Programmable Automation Technologies'', Industrial Press, 2010 {{ISBN|978-0-8311-3346-7}}, Chapter 8 ''Introduction to Programmable Logic Controllers''\n* Tom Mejer Antonsen, 2018 \"PLC Controls with Structured Text (ST)\", {{ISBN|978-87-4300-241-3}},  {{ISBN|978-87-4300-242-0}}\n* {{cite book |title=The Programmable Logic Controller: its prehistory, emergence and application |author-first=Mark John |author-last=Walker |date=2012-09-08 |type=PhD thesis |location=Department of Communication and Systems Faculty of Mathematics, Computing and Technology |publisher=[[The Open University]] |url=http://oro.open.ac.uk/54687/1/594090.pdf |access-date=2018-06-20 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180620115412/http://oro.open.ac.uk/54687/1/594090.pdf |archive-date=2018-06-20}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://plccompare.com/embedded-plc-guide/ A simple guide to Embedded PLCs]\n\n{{Commons category|Programmable logic controller}}\n{{Wikiversity|Programmable logic controller (basics)}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Programmable Logic Controller}}\n[[Category:Industrial automation]]\n[[Category:Industrial computing]]\n[[Category:Programmable logic controllers]]\n[[Category:Wikipedia articles with ASCII art]]\n", "name_user": "VRomanov89", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eExternal links", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmable_logic_controller"}
