But remnants of Roman era artifacts have been isolated in many parts of the municipality, including Aguim, Avel\u00e3s de Caminho, Avel\u00e3s de Cima, Mogofores, Moita, \u00d3is do Bairro, S\u00e3o Louren\u00e7o do Bairro, Vila Nova de Monsarros, Vilarinho do Bairro and, especially, in Anadia (Monte Crasto) and Sangalhos.

The region, during its formative age, was not developed from the implementation of [[foral]]s as was the traditional method of instituting land development. But, in the historical Aveiro district on three forals were instituted to promote development: Ferreiros, Fontemanha and Vale de Avim (centers that were part of the older parish of Moita). There have been posterior references to forals conceded in this area (in Avel\u00e3s de Caminho, for example), but they were insufficiently explained to indicate that the forals were more than mere local or defensive contracts between the Crown and/or the peoples of the area. Further, there were erroneous references to ''older forals'' by contemporary authors, in particular case, the municipalities of Aguim and Anadia. At the beginning of the 16th century, during the administrative reforms of King [[Manuel I of Portugal|Manuel I]], the king did not forget the coastal central region, and allocated several forals. In 1514, the municipalities of Anadia, Avel\u00e3s de Cima, Vilarinho do Bairro, Carvalhais (which included Ferreiros, Fontemanha and Vale de Avim), S\u00e3o Louren\u00e7o do Bairro, Aguim, Sangalhos, Pereiro (the parish of Avel\u00e3s de Cima), \u00d3is do Bairro, Mogofores, Avel\u00e3s de Caminho, Boialvo (parish of Avel\u00e3s de Cima) and Vila Nova de Monsarros; in 1519 Paredes do Bairro was granted a writ and then in 1520 forals for Mogofores and \u00d3is do Bairro were established.\n\n==Geography==\nThe municipality of Anadia is located in the [[Beira Litoral Province|Beira Litoral]] area of the [[Centro Region]], in an area of the [[Baixo Vouga]] referred to as the [[Bairrada]], an area traditionally representative of the district of [[Aveiro (district)|Aveiro]].
