For us these factors include the first-hand experience and/or the intergenerational effects of residential schooling, sexual abuse, and the unrealistic portrayal of our bodies by the media.\u201d<ref name=\":19\" /> Overall, the work \u201cexplores the reclaiming of the bodies and sexualities of [[Transgender|trans]], [[Non-binary gender|non-binary]], [[femme]], and female-identified individuals\u201d.<ref name=\":5\" />  \n\n=== Collaborative practice ===\nDanger focuses on consent in their work, which often manifests through their use of collaborative methods. Along with several collaborative exhibits, collaboration is seen in Danger\u2019s art practice through the consulting, inclusion, and compensation of the Indigenous, two-spirit, queer, and trans communities represented in their work.<ref name=\":2\" /> When creating their beaded BDSM masks, Danger hired and paid other Indigenous folks for their contributing work in the assemblage and beading processes.<ref name=\":2\" /> When producing photographs, Danger consults subjects and continually attains consent to have a more collaborative approach rather than reproducing a colonial gaze and the dichotomy of subject and photographer.<ref name=\":2\" /> This method furthers Danger\u2019s themes of decolonizing sexuality as they work \u201cin collaboration with other queer and two-spirit Indigenous kin to create portraits that visually assert Indigenous sexualities, claim space for a sovereign erotic, and reposition the dominance of the colonial gaze\u201d.<ref name=\":4\" /> In order to collaborate consentually and respectfully, Danger often appears in their own art. They explain how their responsibility as an artist requires a constant awareness of the consent and safety of their subjects--which is why Danger often slips into their shoes: \u201c[My subjects] essentially let me use their image to represent my work. That comes with a lot of responsibility. Often in photography or as artists, we claim somebody\u2019s image just because we\u2019re an artist, or we photograph them\u2026 Yes, [the project] is our idea, but if you\u2019re working with people, there is that level of consent and trust that you need to build, especially because of the type of work that I do. Really putting yourself out there has to do with vulnerability\u2026 I want to know what the folks that are sitting for me are going through. To be in that position of power you always have to be questioning it. How can we ask folks to be visible when society isn\u2019t ready or educated to understand different ways of being and knowing? What would the world look like if my kin could just be safe? So, it was very important to me to also be a part of that [experience].\u201d<ref name=\":14\" />\n\n== Empowerment of Queer and Gender Variant Peoples ==\nDayna Danger\u2019s life pursuits frequently cite or work towards the liberation and representation of Indigenous-Queer, Two-Spirited, and gender variant peoples. <ref>{{cite web |last1=Zilkha |first1=Gabrielle |title=\"Dayna Danger has a powerful message for gender non-conforming folks: 'This work is for you'\" |url=https://www.cbc.ca/arts/dayna-danger-has-a-powerful-message-for-gender-non-conforming-folks-this-work-is-for-you-1.4241754 |website=CBC Arts |accessdate=March 30, 2020}}</ref>Danger facilitates this work through a variety of mediums, including advocacy, community-building, and artwork.

I remember being so comforted by that, just knowing that that weird fluorescent light was on \u2026 I saw that act of making as comfort.\u2019\u201d<ref name=\":20\" /> Thus, the masks represent a form of comfort and a connection to their Indigenous culture and traditions. The masks are also a means of disguising identity and grappling with the existence of agency and consent within a colonial environment.<ref name=\":3\" />  \n\n=== Intersectionalism ===\n\n\tDayna Danger\u2019s work specifically focuses on an element of cultural restoration and expansion of culturally safe spaces by integrating and welcoming in Indigenous-Queer peoples. Such work views the integration of Queer peoples as overcoming a colonially imposed barrier which has limited the acceptance of Indigenous-Queer peoples into certain protocol. In addition to facilitating spaces which are safe to specifically Indigenous-Queer peoples, this work promotes a revitalization and healing of the community by overcoming colonially imposed norms and values which have otherwise ostracized the people Danger advocates and works on behalf of. <ref>{{cite web |last1=Deer |first1=Jessica |title=Montreal gallery strings beadwork from past to now in new exhibition |url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/indigenous/montreal-la-guilde-gallery-beadwork-1.5138228 |website=CBC Indigenous |accessdate=March 30, 2020}}</ref> Danger\u2019s work in beaded fetish masks specifically speaks to this intersectional approach, with Danger commenting that \u201cthere is something so beautiful [about] wearing something that is completely covered in beads on your face\u201d and that \u201cthis is a continuation of how we communicate symbols that are important to us.

Rather than delegitimizing these spaces, Danger\u2019s work presents itself in an integrative and communitarian fashion which expands existing spaces, such as those encapsulated in BDSM, or through 2-Spirit Drum Groups, to include marginalized voices in a more authentic fashion. Danger notes that people who don\u2019t conform to typical gender roles can become isolated from their communities, and that \u201cthey have a hard time getting employment, they have a hard time finding housing\u201d amongst other difficulties. Danger further explains that losing that sense of place \u201cwhere we migrate away from our land, our territories and away from out teachings\u201d puts non-binary people at risk.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Page |first1=Julia |title=Indigenous literature breaks down taboos at Gasp\u00e9 high school |url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/indigenous-literature-breaks-down-taboos-at-gasp\u00e9-high-school-1.5067569 |website=CBC Montreal |accessdate=March 30, 2020}}</ref>\n== Exhibits ==\n\n=== Various exhibits ===\n\n* Urban Shaman, Winnipeg, MB<ref name=\":1\" />\n* Warren G Flowers Art Gallery, Montreal<ref name=\":1\" />\n* dc3 Projects, Edmonton<ref name=\":1\" />\n* Roundhouse Cafe, Vancouver<ref name=\":1\" />\n* New Mexico Museum of Art, Sant'''<span lang=\"EN-CA\"></span>'''a Fe<ref name=\":1\" />\n* ''Disrupt Archives''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lacentrale.org/en/programmation/disrupt-archive-dayna-danger-and-cecilia-kavara-verran/|title=\"Disrupt Archive: Dayna Danger and Cecilia Kavara Verran,\" Programming|last=|first=|date=2016|website=La Centrale Galerie Powerhouse|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=February 13, 2020}}</ref>\n\n====\"Nos Territoires/ Indian Land\u201d====\n'''\u201c'''Nos Territoires / Indian Land\u201d was exhibited September 15, 2018 in Montreal, Quebec, and included several performance pieces by Indigenous artists.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite journal|last=Martel, Richard and Guy Sioui Durand|first=|date=2019|title=Nos Territoires / Indian Land [soir\u00e9e autochtone]|url=|journal=Inter|volume=no. 133|pages=62\u201364|via=}}</ref> Danger wore one of their masks and performed a purification ceremony with traditional herbs.<ref name=\":6\" /> The performance blurred \u201cthe boundaries between performance and ritual art\u201d.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n==== Sisters ====\n\u201cSisters\u201d was exhibited May 8 to July 4, 2015 at Artspace in Peterborough, Ontario.<ref name=\":0\" /> It exhibited Danger\u2019s \u201cSisters\u201d photography series during their first solo exhibit.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==== Big\u2019Uns ====\n\u201cBig \u2019Uns\u201d was exhibited June 9 to July 22, 2017 at Latitude 53 in Edmonton, Alberta.<ref name=\":5\" /> It was the second solo exhibit, featuring Danger\u2019s Big \u2019Uns photography series.

Danger has produced several photographic series, including ''Sisters'', ''Big \u2018Uns'', and ''Bad Girls''. Other photographic works include ''Queering Intimacy'' (2017), and two separate but related works ''To Parmeet with Love'' and ''To Myself with Love'' (2019) which depict images of leather bondage harnesses and a rack of antlers secured on a board.<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite news|last=Murton Stoehr|first=Catherine|url=https://anishinabeknews.ca/2019/09/27/art-queer-potentiality-and-the-north/|title=Art, 'Queer Potentiality, and the North|date=September 17, 2019|work=Anishinabe News|access-date=February 13, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==== Bad Girls (2010) ====\nExhibited at the Gallery of Student Art at the University of Manitoba in 2010, ''Bad Girls'' is a photo series inspired by \u201cscandalous and intriguing women throughout history.\u201d<ref name=\":17\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.daynadanger.com/|title=Bad Girls|last=Danger|first=Dayna|date=|website=Dayna Danger|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Danger takes the Renaissance genre of historical paintings and sexualizes them, reworking them in a modern light to empower, and give control to, the female subject.<ref name=\":18\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.themanitoban.com/2010/01/so-bad-its-good/768/|title=So Bad It's Good|last=Werier|first=Leah|date=January 26, 2010|website=The Manitoban|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> As Danger grew up Catholic, this project explores what women \u201cshould be\u201d doing, and redefines what that looks like: redefining the term \u201cbad girl.\u201d<ref name=\":17\" /> In an interview with The Manitoban, Danger explained \u201cIt made me realize, heck yes, I would love to be a bad girl if it meant I could rise above what society expected of me and what I needed to accomplish.\u201d<ref name=\":18\" />\n\n==== Sisters (2015) ====\nDanger\u2019s work ''Sisters'' is a photography series depicting themselves and their sister, Michelle, which was taken over two years.<ref name=\":0\" /> Sisters was the first project in which Danger became subject in their own work.

For us these factors include the first-hand experience and/or the intergenerational effects of residential schooling, sexual abuse, and the unrealistic portrayal of our bodies by the media.\u201d<ref name=\":19\" /> Overall, the work \u201cexplores the reclaiming of the bodies and sexualities of [[Transgender|trans]], [[Non-binary gender|non-binary]], [[femme]], and female-identified individuals\u201d.<ref name=\":5\" />  \n\n=== Collaborative practice ===\nDanger focuses on consent in their work, which often manifests through their use of collaborative methods. Along with several collaborative exhibits, collaboration is seen in Danger\u2019s art practice through the consulting, inclusion, and compensation of the Indigenous, two-spirit, queer, and trans communities represented in their work.<ref name=\":2\" /> When creating their beaded BDSM masks, Danger hired and paid other Indigenous folks for their contributing work in the assemblage and beading processes.<ref name=\":2\" /> When producing photographs, Danger consults subjects and continually attains consent to have a more collaborative approach rather than reproducing a colonial gaze and the dichotomy of subject and photographer.<ref name=\":2\" /> This method furthers Danger\u2019s themes of decolonizing sexuality as they work \u201cin collaboration with other queer and two-spirit Indigenous kin to create portraits that visually assert Indigenous sexualities, claim space for a sovereign erotic, and reposition the dominance of the colonial gaze\u201d.<ref name=\":4\" /> In order to collaborate consentually and respectfully, Danger often appears in their own art. They explain how their responsibility as an artist requires a constant awareness of the consent and safety of their subjects--which is why Danger often slips into their shoes: \u201c[My subjects] essentially let me use their image to represent my work. That comes with a lot of responsibility. Often in photography or as artists, we claim somebody\u2019s image just because we\u2019re an artist, or we photograph them\u2026 Yes, [the project] is our idea, but if you\u2019re working with people, there is that level of consent and trust that you need to build, especially because of the type of work that I do. Really putting yourself out there has to do with vulnerability\u2026 I want to know what the folks that are sitting for me are going through. To be in that position of power you always have to be questioning it. How can we ask folks to be visible when society isn\u2019t ready or educated to understand different ways of being and knowing? What would the world look like if my kin could just be safe? So, it was very important to me to also be a part of that [experience].\u201d<ref name=\":14\" />\n\n== Empowerment of Queer and Gender Variant Peoples ==\nDayna Danger\u2019s life pursuits frequently cite or work towards the liberation and representation of Indigenous-Queer, Two-Spirited, and gender variant peoples. <ref>{{cite web |last1=Zilkha |first1=Gabrielle |title=\"Dayna Danger has a powerful message for gender non-conforming folks: 'This work is for you'\" |url=https://www.cbc.ca/arts/dayna-danger-has-a-powerful-message-for-gender-non-conforming-folks-this-work-is-for-you-1.4241754 |website=CBC Arts |accessdate=March 30, 2020}}</ref>Danger facilitates this work through a variety of mediums, including advocacy, community-building, and artwork.

In opening this dialogue, Danger deconstructs tropes of BDSM being limited to non-Indigenous peoples, and, instead, promotes the ability for BDSM to promote the beauty of Indigenous-Queer peoples.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Flagella |first1=Genevieve |title=A Fine Pointed Belonging |url=http://www.modernfuel.org/files/Essay_A%20Fine%20Pointed%20Belonging_March%2013.pdf |website=Modern Fuel}}</ref> This work negotiates the line of power and objectification, while relying on an inherent consent model in BDSM which promotes the positive sexual agency of engaging parties.They explore BDSM and kink specifically through leather and beaded works, \u201cas a space for healing colonial trauma\u201d.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|url=Http://www.modernfuel.org/files/Essay_A%20Fine%20Pointed%20Belonging_March%2013.pdf|title=A Fine Pointed Belonging|last=Flavelle|first=Gabrielle|date=2019|website=Modern Fuel|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=February 13, 2020}}</ref> Danger has produced a series of [[Bondage hood|masks]] that resemble BDSM gear but are beaded in a traditional Indigenous style.<ref name=\":3\" /> Their idea to create these fully-beaded BDSM masks began as a joke--Danger explains: \u201cIt was this total joke, thinking of the most native BDSM thing ever, which would be a full fetish bodysuit, but beaded \u2014 just wrap yourself in beads.\u201d Because making a full fetish bodysuit would have taken too long to make, Danger began beading fetish masks.<ref name=\":20\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.cbc.ca/radio/unreserved/let-s-talk-about-sex-neechi-from-art-and-erotic-poetry-to-sexual-health-and-tinder-profiles-1.4410866/the-most-native-bdsm-thing-ever-dayna-danger-s-fetish-masks-challenge-indigenous-sexuality-taboos-1.4517645|title=The most native BDSM thing ever': Dayna Danger's fetish masks challenge Indigenous sexuality taboos|last=|first=|date=February 11, 2018|website=CBC Radio|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> The practice of beading the masks takes up to 100 hours and was inspired by Danger\u2019s mother who made cultural art as well.<ref name=\":3\" /> As such, Dander finds comfort in beading the masks because they have many vivid memories of their mother working on beading and crafting projects: \u201c\u2018There's this big fluorescent light she would put on, and she had all her crafting supplies in the basement, where she would make little dreamcatchers and earrings. I remember being so comforted by that, just knowing that that weird fluorescent light was on \u2026 I saw that act of making as comfort.\u2019\u201d<ref name=\":20\" /> Thus, the masks represent a form of comfort and a connection to their Indigenous culture and traditions. The masks are also a means of disguising identity and grappling with the existence of agency and consent within a colonial environment.<ref name=\":3\" />  \n\n=== Intersectionalism ===\n\n\tDayna Danger\u2019s work specifically focuses on an element of cultural restoration and expansion of culturally safe spaces by integrating and welcoming in Indigenous-Queer peoples. Such work views the integration of Queer peoples as overcoming a colonially imposed barrier which has limited the acceptance of Indigenous-Queer peoples into certain protocol. In addition to facilitating spaces which are safe to specifically Indigenous-Queer peoples, this work promotes a revitalization and healing of the community by overcoming colonially imposed norms and values which have otherwise ostracized the people Danger advocates and works on behalf of. <ref>{{cite web |last1=Deer |first1=Jessica |title=Montreal gallery strings beadwork from past to now in new exhibition |url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/indigenous/montreal-la-guilde-gallery-beadwork-1.5138228 |website=CBC Indigenous |accessdate=March 30, 2020}}</ref> Danger\u2019s work in beaded fetish masks specifically speaks to this intersectional approach, with Danger commenting that \u201cthere is something so beautiful [about] wearing something that is completely covered in beads on your face\u201d and that \u201cthis is a continuation of how we communicate symbols that are important to us. For me, beadwork speaks to that. It\u2019s a  basic read of what is truly resistance. Before glass beads, we still figured out ways to embellish what we wore.

Rather than delegitimizing these spaces, Danger\u2019s work presents itself in an integrative and communitarian fashion which expands existing spaces, such as those encapsulated in BDSM, or through 2-Spirit Drum Groups, to include marginalized voices in a more authentic fashion. Danger notes that people who don\u2019t conform to typical gender roles can become isolated from their communities, and that \u201cthey have a hard time getting employment, they have a hard time finding housing\u201d amongst other difficulties. Danger further explains that losing that sense of place \u201cwhere we migrate away from our land, our territories and away from out teachings\u201d puts non-binary people at risk.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Page |first1=Julia |title=Indigenous literature breaks down taboos at Gasp\u00e9 high school |url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/indigenous-literature-breaks-down-taboos-at-gasp\u00e9-high-school-1.5067569 |website=CBC Montreal |accessdate=March 30, 2020}}</ref>\n== Exhibits ==\n\n=== Various exhibits ===\n\n* Urban Shaman, Winnipeg, MB<ref name=\":1\" />\n* Warren G Flowers Art Gallery, Montreal<ref name=\":1\" />\n* dc3 Projects, Edmonton<ref name=\":1\" />\n* Roundhouse Cafe, Vancouver<ref name=\":1\" />\n* New Mexico Museum of Art, Sant'''<span lang=\"EN-CA\"></span>'''a Fe<ref name=\":1\" />\n* ''Disrupt Archives''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lacentrale.org/en/programmation/disrupt-archive-dayna-danger-and-cecilia-kavara-verran/|title=\"Disrupt Archive: Dayna Danger and Cecilia Kavara Verran,\" Programming|last=|first=|date=2016|website=La Centrale Galerie Powerhouse|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=February 13, 2020}}</ref>\n\n====\"Nos Territoires/ Indian Land\u201d====\n'''\u201c'''Nos Territoires / Indian Land\u201d was exhibited September 15, 2018 in Montreal, Quebec, and included several performance pieces by Indigenous artists.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite journal|last=Martel, Richard and Guy Sioui Durand|first=|date=2019|title=Nos Territoires / Indian Land [soir\u00e9e autochtone]|url=|journal=Inter|volume=no. 133|pages=62\u201364|via=}}</ref> Danger wore one of their masks and performed a purification ceremony with traditional herbs.<ref name=\":6\" /> The performance blurred \u201cthe boundaries between performance and ritual art\u201d.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n==== Sisters ====\n\u201cSisters\u201d was exhibited May 8 to July 4, 2015 at Artspace in Peterborough, Ontario.<ref name=\":0\" /> It exhibited Danger\u2019s \u201cSisters\u201d photography series during their first solo exhibit.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==== Big\u2019Uns ====\n\u201cBig \u2019Uns\u201d was exhibited June 9 to July 22, 2017 at Latitude 53 in Edmonton, Alberta.<ref name=\":5\" /> It was the second solo exhibit, featuring Danger\u2019s Big \u2019Uns photography series.

His parents were immigrants to France; his father was [[Bulgarians|Bulgarian]] and his mother was [[Poles|Polish]]. His nickname growing up was D\u00e9d\u00e9 ({{IPAc-en|\u02c8|d|e\u026a|d|e\u026a}}, {{IPA-fr|dede|lang}}). As a child, he displayed symptoms of [[gigantism]] very early, reaching a height of {{convert|6|ft|3|in|cm|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} and a weight of {{convert|208|lb|kg|abbr=on|order=flip}} by the age of 12.\n\nRoussimoff was a good student, particularly in [[mathematics]], but he dropped out after the eighth grade since he did not think having a [[Secondary school|high school]] education was necessary for a farm labourer.

In reality, he had agreed to lose the match sometime before, mostly for health reasons. Contrary to popular belief, it was not the first time that Hogan had successfully body-slammed him in a WWF match.

The feud between Roussimoff and Hogan simmered during the summer of 1987, as Roussimoff's health declined. The feud began heating up again when wrestlers were named the captains of rival teams at the inaugural [[Survivor Series (1987)|Survivor Series]] event. During their approximately one minute of battling each other during the match, Hogan dominated Roussimoff and was on the brink of knocking him from the ring, but was tripped up by his partners, Bundy and [[One Man Gang]], and would be counted out. Roussimoff went on to be the sole survivor of the match, pinning [[Bam Bam Bigelow]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/survivorseries/history/1987/mainevent/ |title=Survivor Series 1987 \u2013 Main Event |website=[[WWE]] |accessdate=February 15, 2011}}</ref> before Hogan returned to the ring to attack Andr\u00e9 and knock him out of the ring. Roussimoff later got revenge when, after Hogan won a match against Bundy on ''Saturday Night's Main Event'', he snuck up from behind and began choking Hogan to the brink of unconsciousness, not letting go even after an army of seven face-aligned wrestlers ran to the ring to try to pull him away; it took Hacksaw Jim Duggan breaking a piece of wood over his back (which he [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms|no-sold]]) for him to let go, after which Hogan was pulled to safety. As was the case with the ''SNME'' battle royal a year earlier, the series of events was one of the pieces that helped build interest in a possible one-on-one rematch between Hogan and Roussimoff, and to make it seem that Roussimoff was certain to win easily when they did meet.\n\nIn the meantime, [[Ted DiBiase|the \"Million Dollar Man\" Ted DiBiase]] failed to persuade Hogan to sell him the WWF World Heavyweight Championship. After failing to defeat Hogan in a subsequent series of matches, DiBiase turned to Roussimoff to win it for him.{{sfnp|Krugman|2009|pp=172\u2013175}} He and DiBiase had teamed several times in the past, including in Japan and in the WWF in the late 1970s and early 1980s when both were faces, but this was not acknowledged during this new storyline. The earlier attack and DiBiase's insertion into the feud set up the Hogan-Roussimoff rematch on ''The Main Event'', to air February 5, 1988, on a live broadcast on NBC. Acting as his hired gun, Roussimoff won the WWF World Heavyweight Championship from Hogan (his first singles title) in a match where it was later revealed that appointed referee [[Dave Hebner]] was \"detained backstage\", and a replacement (whom Hogan afterwards initially accused of having been paid by DiBiase to get plastic surgery to look like Dave,<ref>Hulk Hogan postmatch interview, ''The Main Event'' NBC television, February 5, 1988</ref> but was revealed to have been his evil twin brother, [[Earl Hebner]]),<ref>\"A ''WWF Magazine'' Investigative Report: Dave Hebner's Shadow,\" ''[[WWE Magazine|WWF Magazine]]'', June 1988, p. 30.</ref> made a three count on Hogan while his shoulders were off the mat.\n\nAfter winning, Roussimoff \"sold\" the title to DiBiase; the transaction was declared invalid by then-[[Professional wrestling authority figures|WWF president]] Jack Tunney and the title was declared vacant.<ref name=wwechamp>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/wwechampionship/304454122 |title=Andre the Giant's first reign |website=[[WWE]] | accessdate=February 15, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050624001310/http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/wwechampionship/304454122 |archivedate=June 24, 2005}}</ref> This was shown on WWF's [[NBC]] program ''[[The Main Event (1988)|The Main Event]]''. At [[WrestleMania IV]], Roussimoff and Hulk Hogan fought to a double disqualification in a WWF title tournament match (with the idea in the storyline saying that Roussimoff was again working on DiBiase's behalf in giving DiBiase a clearer path in the tournament). Afterward, Roussimoff and Hogan's feud died down after a steel cage match held at ''WrestleFest'' on July 31, 1988, in Milwaukee.\n\nAt the inaugural SummerSlam pay-per-view held at [[Madison Square Garden]], Roussimoff and DiBiase (billed as [[The Mega Bucks]]) faced Hogan and WWF World Heavyweight Champion [[Randy Savage|\"Macho Man\" Randy Savage]] (known as [[The Mega Powers]]) in the main event, with [[Jesse Ventura|Jesse \"The Body\" Ventura]] as the special guest referee.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/summerslam/history/1988/mainevent1/ |title=SummerSlam 1988 main event match details |website=[[WWE]] | accessdate=March 6, 2011}}</ref> During the match, the Mega Powers' manager, [[Miss Elizabeth]], distracted the Mega Bucks and Ventura when she climbed up on the ring apron, removed her yellow skirt and walked around in a pair of red panties. This allowed Hogan and Savage time to recover and eventually win the match with Hogan pinning DiBiase. Savage forced Ventura's hand down for the final three-count, due to Ventura's character historically being at odds with Hogan, and his unwillingness to count the fall.\n\nConcurrent with the developing feud with the Mega Powers, Roussimoff was placed in a feud with [[Jim Duggan]], which began after Duggan knocked out Roussimoff with a two-by-four board during a television taping. Despite Duggan's popularity with fans, Roussimoff regularly got the upper hand in the feud.\n\n[[File:Jake Roberts and Andre.jpg|thumb|Roussimoff's feud with [[Jake Roberts]] derived from Roussimoff's [[ophidiophobia|fear of snakes]].]]\nRoussimoff's next major feud was against [[Jake Roberts|Jake \"The Snake\" Roberts]]. In this storyline, it was said Roussimoff was [[Ophidiophobia|afraid of snakes]], something Roberts exposed on ''Saturday Night's Main Event'' when he threw his snake, Damien, on the frightened Roussimoff; as a result, he suffered a [[kayfabe]] mild heart attack and vowed revenge. During the next few weeks, Roberts frequently walked to ringside carrying his snake in its bag during Roussimoff's matches, causing the latter to run from the ring in fright. Throughout their feud (which culminated at [[WrestleMania V]]), Roberts constantly used Damien to gain a psychological edge over the much larger and stronger Roussimoff.\n\nIn 1989, Roussimoff and the returning Big John Studd briefly reprised their feud, beginning at WrestleMania V, when Studd was the referee in the match with Roberts, this time with Studd as a face and Roussimoff as the heel. During the late summer and Autumn of 1989, he engaged in a brief feud, consisting almost entirely of [[house show]]s (non-televised events), with then-[[WWE Intercontinental Championship|Intercontinental Champion]] [[Warrior (wrestler)|The Ultimate Warrior]]. The younger Warrior, WWF's rising star, regularly [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Squash|squashed]] the aging Roussimoff in an attempt to showcase his star quality and promote him as the \"next big thing\".{{sfnp|Krugman|2009|pp=297\u2013300}}<ref>{{cite book |title=Hitman: My Real Life in the Cartoon World of Wrestling |last=Hart |first=Bret |authorlink=Bret Hart |page=[https://archive.org/details/hitmanmyreallife00hart/page/233 233] |publisher=[[Hachette Book Group USA#Current imprints|Grand Central Publishing]] |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-446-53972-2 |url=https://archive.org/details/hitmanmyreallife00hart/page/233 }}</ref>\n\n==== The Colossal Connection (1989\u20131990) ====\n{{Main|The Colossal Connection|l1=The Colossal Connection}}\nIn late 1989, Roussimoff was joined with fellow [[The Heenan Family|Heenan Family]] member [[Tonga Fifita|Haku]] to form a new tag team called [[the Colossal Connection]], in part to fill a void left by the departure of [[Tully Blanchard]] and [[Arn Anderson]] ([[the Brain Busters]], who were also members of Heenan's stable) from the WWF, and also to continue to keep the aging Roussimoff in the main event spotlight.

Due to his ongoing health issues, Roussimoff was not able to wrestle at the time of Wrestlemania VI and Haku actually wrestled the entire match against Demolition without tagging him in.\n\nOn weekend television shows following WrestleMania VI, Bobby Heenan vowed to spit in Roussimoff's face when he came crawling back to the Heenan Family.

In reality, he had agreed to lose the match sometime before, mostly for health reasons. Contrary to popular belief, it was not the first time that Hogan had successfully body-slammed him in a WWF match.

The feud between Roussimoff and Hogan simmered during the summer of 1987, as Roussimoff's health declined. The feud began heating up again when wrestlers were named the captains of rival teams at the inaugural [[Survivor Series (1987)|Survivor Series]] event. During their approximately one minute of battling each other during the match, Hogan dominated Roussimoff and was on the brink of knocking him from the ring, but was tripped up by his partners, Bundy and [[One Man Gang]], and would be counted out. Roussimoff went on to be the sole survivor of the match, pinning [[Bam Bam Bigelow]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/survivorseries/history/1987/mainevent/ |title=Survivor Series 1987 \u2013 Main Event |website=[[WWE]] |accessdate=February 15, 2011}}</ref> before Hogan returned to the ring to attack Andr\u00e9 and knock him out of the ring. Roussimoff later got revenge when, after Hogan won a match against Bundy on ''Saturday Night's Main Event'', he snuck up from behind and began choking Hogan to the brink of unconsciousness, not letting go even after an army of seven face-aligned wrestlers ran to the ring to try to pull him away; it took Hacksaw Jim Duggan breaking a piece of wood over his back (which he [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms|no-sold]]) for him to let go, after which Hogan was pulled to safety. As was the case with the ''SNME'' battle royal a year earlier, the series of events was one of the pieces that helped build interest in a possible one-on-one rematch between Hogan and Roussimoff, and to make it seem that Roussimoff was certain to win easily when they did meet.\n\nIn the meantime, [[Ted DiBiase|the \"Million Dollar Man\" Ted DiBiase]] failed to persuade Hogan to sell him the WWF World Heavyweight Championship. After failing to defeat Hogan in a subsequent series of matches, DiBiase turned to Roussimoff to win it for him.{{sfnp|Krugman|2009|pp=172\u2013175}} He and DiBiase had teamed several times in the past, including in Japan and in the WWF in the late 1970s and early 1980s when both were faces, but this was not acknowledged during this new storyline. The earlier attack and DiBiase's insertion into the feud set up the Hogan-Roussimoff rematch on ''The Main Event'', to air February 5, 1988, on a live broadcast on NBC. Acting as his hired gun, Roussimoff won the WWF World Heavyweight Championship from Hogan (his first singles title) in a match where it was later revealed that appointed referee [[Dave Hebner]] was \"detained backstage\", and a replacement (whom Hogan afterwards initially accused of having been paid by DiBiase to get plastic surgery to look like Dave,<ref>Hulk Hogan postmatch interview, ''The Main Event'' NBC television, February 5, 1988</ref> but was revealed to have been his evil twin brother, [[Earl Hebner]]),<ref>\"A ''WWF Magazine'' Investigative Report: Dave Hebner's Shadow,\" ''[[WWE Magazine|WWF Magazine]]'', June 1988, p. 30.</ref> made a three count on Hogan while his shoulders were off the mat.\n\nAfter winning, Roussimoff \"sold\" the title to DiBiase; the transaction was declared invalid by then-[[Professional wrestling authority figures|WWF president]] Jack Tunney and the title was declared vacant.<ref name=wwechamp>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/wwechampionship/304454122 |title=Andre the Giant's first reign |website=[[WWE]] | accessdate=February 15, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050624001310/http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/wwechampionship/304454122 |archivedate=June 24, 2005}}</ref> This was shown on WWF's [[NBC]] program ''[[The Main Event (1988)|The Main Event]]''. At [[WrestleMania IV]], Roussimoff and Hulk Hogan fought to a double disqualification in a WWF title tournament match (with the idea in the storyline saying that Roussimoff was again working on DiBiase's behalf in giving DiBiase a clearer path in the tournament). Afterward, Roussimoff and Hogan's feud died down after a steel cage match held at ''WrestleFest'' on July 31, 1988, in Milwaukee.\n\nAt the inaugural SummerSlam pay-per-view held at [[Madison Square Garden]], Roussimoff and DiBiase (billed as [[The Mega Bucks]]) faced Hogan and WWF World Heavyweight Champion [[Randy Savage|\"Macho Man\" Randy Savage]] (known as [[The Mega Powers]]) in the main event, with [[Jesse Ventura|Jesse \"The Body\" Ventura]] as the special guest referee.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/summerslam/history/1988/mainevent1/ |title=SummerSlam 1988 main event match details |website=[[WWE]] | accessdate=March 6, 2011}}</ref> During the match, the Mega Powers' manager, [[Miss Elizabeth]], distracted the Mega Bucks and Ventura when she climbed up on the ring apron, removed her yellow skirt and walked around in a pair of red panties. This allowed Hogan and Savage time to recover and eventually win the match with Hogan pinning DiBiase. Savage forced Ventura's hand down for the final three-count, due to Ventura's character historically being at odds with Hogan, and his unwillingness to count the fall.\n\nConcurrent with the developing feud with the Mega Powers, Roussimoff was placed in a feud with [[Jim Duggan]], which began after Duggan knocked out Roussimoff with a two-by-four board during a television taping. Despite Duggan's popularity with fans, Roussimoff regularly got the upper hand in the feud.\n\n[[File:Jake Roberts and Andre.jpg|thumb|Roussimoff's feud with [[Jake Roberts]] derived from Roussimoff's [[ophidiophobia|fear of snakes]].]]\nRoussimoff's next major feud was against [[Jake Roberts|Jake \"The Snake\" Roberts]]. In this storyline, it was said Roussimoff was [[Ophidiophobia|afraid of snakes]], something Roberts exposed on ''Saturday Night's Main Event'' when he threw his snake, Damien, on the frightened Roussimoff; as a result, he suffered a [[kayfabe]] mild heart attack and vowed revenge. During the next few weeks, Roberts frequently walked to ringside carrying his snake in its bag during Roussimoff's matches, causing the latter to run from the ring in fright. Throughout their feud (which culminated at [[WrestleMania V]]), Roberts constantly used Damien to gain a psychological edge over the much larger and stronger Roussimoff.\n\nIn 1989, Roussimoff and the returning Big John Studd briefly reprised their feud, beginning at WrestleMania V, when Studd was the referee in the match with Roberts, this time with Studd as a face and Roussimoff as the heel. During the late summer and Autumn of 1989, he engaged in a brief feud, consisting almost entirely of [[house show]]s (non-televised events), with then-[[WWE Intercontinental Championship|Intercontinental Champion]] [[Warrior (wrestler)|The Ultimate Warrior]].

The abductions are traced to Dr. Maaran, a world-famous doctor from [[Chennai]] known for providing {{INR}}5 treatment to patients of all sections of society. Maaran is arrested and interrogated by Ratnavel \"Randy\", a police officer who is assigned the abduction case. Maaran explains his motive for the abductions; An Auto Driver's daughter had been severely injured and  the four were responsible for the death of the auto driver's school-going daughter and his wife due to their greed for money in the name of providing proper healthcare. He adds that he had also killed all of them while they were in his captivity.\n\nAt this juncture, Maaran reveals that he is not Maaran but is his [[doppelg\u00e4nger]] Vetri, a [[Magician (illusionist)|magician]].Vetri was responsible for the death of Dr. Arjun Zachariah, a corrupt doctor who was killed during a stage performance in Paris two years earlier,by Vetri himself by using  Anupallavi who is also his love interest. He further adds that he had saved Maaran from getting killed by the henchmen of Dr. Daniel Arockiyaraj.Daniel,another corrupt doctor had been associated with Arjun who sees Maaran's inexpensive healthcare as a threat to his flourishing hospital business.After beating them up,Vetri knocks out Maaran unconscious and swaps place with him.Then he provides clues to the police which led to his arrest as showed in the beginning. Maaran is rescued, while Vetri, with the help of his magic tricks, manages to escape from Randy.\n\nLater, Maaran confronts Vetri and fights him, believing him to be the cause of all his problems with the law as well as with Daniel, who had threatened Maaran to reveal the location of Vetri while keeping his mother Sarala and fianc\u00e9e Tara hostage. Vadivu, Maaran's compounder and also Vetri's assistant, intervenes in their fight and explains to Maaran why Vetri is targeting doctors indulging in corrupt medical practices in general and Daniel and Arjun in particular.\n\nMaaran was the elder son of Vetrimaaran, a village [[wrestling|wrestler]].Vetrimaaran being referred as Thalapathy by his villagers,decides to build a temple in his area.He holds a large scale event for the building day with a festive mode.However,a fire had started causing many people and children to get injured and two children had died due to their lack of mobility.By the advice of Ice,Vetrimaaran had established a hospital with the help of a younger Daniel and Arjun in his village Manoor in [[Madurai district]]. Daniel and Arjun were also made as the chief doctors of the hospital.\n\nHowever, it soon turns out that Daniel and Arjun were money-minded crooks and performed a [[Caesarean section]] on Vetrimaaran's wife Aishwarya \"Ice\" when she was in labour with her second child, with the intention of extracting more money from Vetrimaaran, even though she could deliver the child [[vaginal delivery|normally]]. Ice lost a lot of blood during the operation, and that, along with an overdose of [[anaesthesia]], led to her death, while the child was declared [[stillborn]]. When Vetrimaaran found out how Ice had died, he went to confront Daniel, empty beer bottles start to hit him and the back of Vetrimaaran was stabbed to death by one of Daniel's henchmen, but just before he died, he placed an unconscious Maaran (who had been struck on the head with a glass bottle by Daniel's henchman) safely on a Chennai-bound lorry. Due to the impact the glass bottle had on his head, Maaran lost his memory and is unable to recollect anything that happened before he was hit on the head.\n\nMeanwhile, Vetrimaaran's second child did not turn out to be stillborn, and this child was none other than Vetri. Vetri was adopted by a famous magician named Salim Ghosh, and it was from him that Vetri learnt all his magic tricks. On hearing Vadivu's story, Maaran reconciles with Vetri and takes his place when police come to arrest Vetri. With Vetri (who is actually Maaran) seemingly in custody, Daniel tries to make a deal with Maaran (who is actually Vetri) to shut down his practice. However, when he finds out the truth, he rushes to Vetri's hideout, bringing with him an unconscious Maaran, who had met with an accident orchestrated by Daniel while he was being taken to court, with the intention of killing both Vetri and Maaran. However, Vetri and Maaran, with the help of their respective professional skills, team up to kill Daniel.\n\nLater, however, Vetri is arrested for his role in the murders of Daniel and Arjun as well as the four people killed earlier in the film and is sentenced to prison for an unspecified period of time. Before going to jail, he gives a press conference justifying his actions and adds that he would continue with the murders until all doctors and hospital staff indulging in corrupt practices are eliminated.

The abductions are traced to Dr. Maaran, a world-famous doctor from [[Chennai]] known for providing {{INR}}5 treatment to patients of all sections of society. Maaran is arrested and interrogated by Ratnavel \"Randy\", a police officer who is assigned the abduction case. Maaran explains his motive for the abductions; An Auto Driver's daughter had been severely injured and  the four were responsible for the death of the auto driver's school-going daughter and his wife due to their greed for money in the name of providing proper healthcare. He adds that he had also killed all of them while they were in his captivity.\n\nAt this juncture, Maaran reveals that he is not Maaran but is his [[doppelg\u00e4nger]] Vetri, a [[Magician (illusionist)|magician]].Vetri was responsible for the death of Dr. Arjun Zachariah, a corrupt doctor who was killed during a stage performance in Paris two years earlier,by Vetri himself by using  Anupallavi who is also his love interest. He further adds that he had saved Maaran from getting killed by the henchmen of Dr. Daniel Arockiyaraj.Daniel,another corrupt doctor had been associated with Arjun who sees Maaran's inexpensive healthcare as a threat to his flourishing hospital business.After beating them up,Vetri knocks out Maaran unconscious and swaps place with him.Then he provides clues to the police which led to his arrest as showed in the beginning. Maaran is rescued, while Vetri, with the help of his magic tricks, manages to escape from Randy.\n\nLater, Maaran confronts Vetri and fights him, believing him to be the cause of all his problems with the law as well as with Daniel, who had threatened Maaran to reveal the location of Vetri while keeping his mother Sarala and fianc\u00e9e Tara hostage. Vadivu, Maaran's compounder and also Vetri's assistant, intervenes in their fight and explains to Maaran why Vetri is targeting doctors indulging in corrupt medical practices in general and Daniel and Arjun in particular.\n\nMaaran was the elder son of Vetrimaaran, a village [[wrestling|wrestler]].Vetrimaaran being referred as Thalapathy by his villagers,decides to build a temple in his area.He holds a large scale event for the building day with a festive mode.However,a fire had started causing many people and children to get injured and two children had died due to their lack of mobility.By the advice of Ice,Vetrimaaran had established a hospital with the help of a younger Daniel and Arjun in his village Manoor in [[Madurai district]]. Daniel and Arjun were also made as the chief doctors of the hospital.\n\nHowever, it soon turns out that Daniel and Arjun were money-minded crooks and performed a [[Caesarean section]] on Vetrimaaran's wife Aishwarya \"Ice\" when she was in labour with her second child, with the intention of extracting more money from Vetrimaaran, even though she could deliver the child [[vaginal delivery|normally]]. Ice lost a lot of blood during the operation, and that, along with an overdose of [[anaesthesia]], led to her death, while the child was declared [[stillborn]]. When Vetrimaaran found out how Ice had died, he went to confront Daniel, empty beer bottles start to hit him and the back of Vetrimaaran was stabbed to death by one of Daniel's henchmen, but just before he died, he placed an unconscious Maaran (who had been struck on the head with a glass bottle by Daniel's henchman) safely on a Chennai-bound lorry. Due to the impact the glass bottle had on his head, Maaran lost his memory and is unable to recollect anything that happened before he was hit on the head.\n\nMeanwhile, Vetrimaaran's second child did not turn out to be stillborn, and this child was none other than Vetri. Vetri was adopted by a famous magician named Salim Ghosh, and it was from him that Vetri learnt all his magic tricks. On hearing Vadivu's story, Maaran reconciles with Vetri and takes his place when police come to arrest Vetri. With Vetri (who is actually Maaran) seemingly in custody, Daniel tries to make a deal with Maaran (who is actually Vetri) to shut down his practice. However, when he finds out the truth, he rushes to Vetri's hideout, bringing with him an unconscious Maaran, who had met with an accident orchestrated by Daniel while he was being taken to court, with the intention of killing both Vetri and Maaran. However, Vetri and Maaran, with the help of their respective professional skills, team up to kill Daniel.\n\nLater, however, Vetri is arrested for his role in the murders of Daniel and Arjun as well as the four people killed earlier in the film and is sentenced to prison for an unspecified period of time. Before going to jail, he gives a press conference justifying his actions and adds that he would continue with the murders until all doctors and hospital staff indulging in corrupt practices are eliminated. In prison, Vetri watches a news report in which a young girl in [[Odisha]] had died due to negligent medical treatment. On hearing this, Vetri escapes with the help of his magic tricks, thus continuing his mission. In a mid-credits scene, Maaran is conferred a statewide recognised medical counsellor post, which he accepts.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Vijay (actor)|Vijay]] in a triple role as\n**Vetrimaaran, a village wrestler, commonly referred by the people as \"Thalapathy\" and who gets killed by Daniel and Kasi\n**Dr. Maaran, Vetrimaaran's first son, a doctor who serves people for just 5 rupees and gets conferred a statewide medical counsellor post\n**Vetri, Vetrimaaran's second son, a magician and Maaran's younger brother who gets arrested for his role in the murders\n* [[Kajal Aggarwal]] as Anu Pallavi, Vetri's love interest, a doctor and Arjun's assistant\n* [[Samantha Ruth Prabhu]] as Thara, a media anchor and Maaran's love interest\n* [[Nithya Menen]] as Aishwarya \"Ice\" Vetrimaaran, Vetrimaaran's wife who dies in a hospital due to blood loss and overdose of anaesthesia \n* [[S.

The series is loosely based on a series of characters introduced in a picture book entitled ''[[Creepy Susie and 13 Other Tragic Tales for Troubled Children]]''.<ref name=Perlmutter>{{cite book |last1=Perlmutter |first1=David |title=The Encyclopedia of American Animated Television Shows |date=2018 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |isbn=978-1538103739 |page=434}}</ref> \n\nThe show was produced by Jobsite Productions and [[Mohawk Productions]] in association with [[Warner Bros. Television]], and the theme song for the series was composed and performed by [[They Might Be Giants]].\n\nA total of 13 episodes were produced. All thirteen episodes of ''The Oblongs'' were released on DVD on October 4, 2005.\n\n==Setting and premise==\nThe series focuses on the antics of a family who live in a poor valley community, and as a result of pollution and [[radiation]] exposure, are all [[Disability|disabled]] or [[Deformity|deformed]].  The pollution is the direct result of the lavish lifestyle of the rich community known as \"The Hills\", whose residents exploit and harm the valley residents with absolutely no regard for their safety or well-being.\n\n===Social commentary===\nMany reviewers and fans see the series as a [[social commentary|commentary]] on [[social stratification]].<ref name = \"NY Daily News Article\">\"[http://articles.nydailynews.com/2001-03-30/entertainment/18183263_1_pamela-segall-adlon-oblongs-jeannie-elias 'The Oblongs' Shapes Up As A Toxic Treat]\". Eric Mink. New York Daily News. Retrieved November 26, 2012.</ref>\n\n==Characters==\n\n===The Oblong family===\n* {{anchor|Bob}}Bob Oblong ([[Will Ferrell]]) \u2013 Born [[Tetra-amelia syndrome|without arms or legs]], Bob works at a poison factory called the Globocide.  Despite his deformities, he is very chipper and sunny, and is modeled after various fathers from 1950s TV shows.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}  He has a happy-go-lucky attitude.  He is married to Pickles and is the father of Biff, Chip, Milo, and Beth.  The only time he had limbs was in the episode \"My Name is Robbie\". While he mostly uses his mouth for tasking, he can often drive with his mind in various episodes, or read a newspaper with his mind, as seen in \"Flush, Flush, Sweet Helga\", which assumes that he may have mind powers.\n* {{anchor|Pickles}}Pickles Oblong ([[Jean Smart]]) \u2013 A [[chain smoking]] [[Alcoholism|alcoholic]] who was originally a Hill resident but moved to the valley after marrying Bob.  All of her hair has since fallen out (something which is usually hidden by an extremely tall blonde [[beehive (hairstyle)|beehive]] wig) due to the hazardous atmosphere of The Valley, and she is now regarded as an outcast by her former Hill friends. While not bitter about losing her privileged life, she often expresses disdain towards her self-centered former neighbors in the Hills.  She is married to Bob, and is the mother of Biff, Chip, Milo, and Beth.\n* {{anchor|Biff&Chip}}Biff Oblong ([[Randy and Jason Sklar|Randy Sklar]]) and Chip Oblong ([[Randy and Jason Sklar|Jason Sklar]]) \u2013 17-year-old [[conjoined twins]] who are attached at the waist and share a middle leg.  Biff is a hard worker obsessed with sports, while Chip is more laid back.  It is frequently implied that Biff is [[Homosexuality|gay]] and attracted to their coach;{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} however, there are instances when the two are seen lusting after girls together.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}  Biff and Chip each occasionally go into \"trances\" to give the other brother privacy.<ref>Episode 10, \"Get Off My Back\"</ref>\n* {{anchor|Milo}}Milo Oblong ([[Pamela Adlon]]) \u2013 The youngest son. Often referred to by other kids as a \u201cpsycho\u201d, he is afflicted with numerous mental and social disorders and is on \"everything from [[Methylphenidate|Ritalin]] to [[Minoxidil|Rogaine]].\"  Despite his afflictions, he is a very forthright and benevolent boy, though he envies the Hill lifestyle and wishes to rise above his economic status.  He has a single hair sticking up on his head, a squint in one eye (which also occasionally twitches) and often wears a shirt that says \"NO\".\n* {{anchor|Beth}}Beth Oblong ([[Jeannie Elias]]) \u2013 The youngest child and only daughter, she has a warty, elongated growth growing out of her head. Despite her appendage, she is shown to be better adjusted than the rest of her family. In the episode \"Pickles' Lil' Amazons\", it is revealed that the growth on her head is the result of eating meat containing bovine growth hormones. In the episode \"My Name is Robbie\", it is revealed that her birthday is June 7.\n* Grammy Oblong \u2013 Bob's [[Persistent vegetative state|vegetative]] mother who resides in a [[motorized wheelchair]] and is [[Muteness|unable to speak]]. Instead, she communicates using a green light which means yes, a red light which means no, and a flashing red light which means she has soiled herself and that her diapers need changing.\n* {{anchor|Lucky}}Lucky \u2013 The one-lunged family cat who chain-smokes cigarettes and wears an uninterested, deadpan expression.\n* Scottie \u2013 Milo's [[Narcolepsy|narcoleptic]] dog, a result of perfume used on him during his tenure as a test animal at Globocide. Scottie was based on the short story \"Narcoleptic Scottie\" in ''Creepy Susie''.\n\n===Milo's friends, \"The Clubhouse Kids\"===\n* Helga Phugly ([[Lea DeLaria]]) \u2013 A fat, toad-like girl who will eat virtually anything. She lives in a fantasy world, believing that she is pretty and popular and that the \"Debbies'\" actually like her (she stubbornly believes this, as when told that the Debbies hate her, she covered her ears, shut her eyes, and started stomping around humming very loudly).  At times, she is shown to have a [[Puppy love|crush]] on Milo, leading to her kidnapping him in the episode \"Milo Interrupted\". When her parents went on vacation and never returned, Helga was forced to live at home by herself, eating only rejected wedding cakes from a nearby wedding cake factory and the occasional animal that she spotted.  Milo eventually locates her parents when Mrs. Hubbard, a Bible-thumping, gun-toting old woman, tries to adopt Helga.<ref>\"Milo Interrupted\"</ref>  Her last name, Phugly, is derived from the word \"fugly\", which is a term short for \"fucking ugly\".\n* [[Creepy Susie and 13 Other Tragic Tales for Troubled Children|Creepy Susie]] (Jeannie Elias) \u2013 A girl who speaks with a [[deadpan]] French accent and appears to float instead of walk, as her legs are never shown.  She is obsessed with [[death]], and has a problem with [[pyromania]], but it has been revealed she does enjoy [[hula hoop]]s.\n* Peggy (Becky Thyre) \u2013 A one-breasted girl who lacks a lower jaw, causing her to spit and talk with a [[lisp]].  Despite her deformities, Peggy is cheerful and upbeat.  The daughter of a gay couple, she dreams of being president and marrying a handsome [[Speech-language pathology|speech therapist]].\n* Mikey (Jeannie Elias) \u2013 A boy saddled with a dangling, doubled posterior. Standard [[Undergarment|underwear]] will not fit him, so he wears his grandmother's old [[bra]] like backwards [[suspenders]].  He is also known to habitually probe his nose and ears with his finger. Because of his larger deformed posterior, he takes jokes about the area more literally especially since they often come true soon after. As a running gag, he is inflicted with severe misfortune in almost every appearance, ranging from being stung by bees to being attacked by dogs.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}\n\n===The Hill residents===\n* George Klimer ([[Billy West (voice actor)|Billy West]]) \u2013 Bob's rich and [[snobby]] boss. He represents the power and arrogance of the people of the Hills.  He is very condescending to his employees, especially Bob and James. He is husband to Pristine and father of Jared and Debbie Klimer.\n* Pristine Klimer (Becky Thyre) \u2013 The wife of George and mother to Jared and Debbie. Pristine was good friends with Pickles before she married Bob, but abandoned her once she went to live in the valley.\n* Jared Klimer (Pamela Adlon) \u2013 The arrogant son of George and Pristine and brother to Debbie.  He likes to taunt The Clubhouse Kids, along with his equally snobbish best friend Blaine. He calls Milo \"Obdong\". In the episode \"Get Off My Back\", Milo retorts with the information that a rumor of Jared and Blaine claims the two have had sex with each other.\n* Debbie Klimer (Becky Thyre; Pamela Segall Adlon, in some episodes) - The only daughter of George and Pristine Klimer, and sister of Jared. She is the leader of \"The Debbies\" and is considered the most beautiful and popular girl in school, even though all of her friends are identical. Like most Hill residents, she often treats the people in the Valley with cruelty. She is the only Debbie with her last name known, besides Debbie Bledsoe.\n* The Debbies (Becky Thyre, Pamela Adlon in some episodes) \u2013 A popular [[clique]] of identical girls who dress alike and happen to all be named Debbie. Despite them all being identical to one another, each Debbie is the daughter of a different wealthy Hill resident, with no relation. They seem to be a symbol of how most popular people tend to be conformists and lack originality and difference, hence why they are all named Debbie and have the same appearance. The Debbies are often cruel to the valley kids, especially Helga who aspires to be accepted by them.\n* Mayor Johnny \"The Mayor\" Bledsoe (Billy West) \u2013 The town's mayor and a masked [[professional wrestling|pro wrestler]].  He is corrupt, and his daughter is a Debbie.\n* Leland Bergstein (Billy West) \u2013 The kids' homeroom teacher, who is shown to be weak and easily cowed by the Debbies and the rich residents of the town. It is revealed that he lives in the Hills, as seen in the episode \"Milo Interrupted\".\n* Sheriff Pepper ([[Maurice LaMarche]]) \u2013 Hill Valley's inept, corrupt law enforcer.  He favors the people of the Hills and provides better law enforcement for them.\n* Dr. Hofschneider (Billy West) \u2013 The Oblongs' condescending and uninterested doctor.\n* Mrs. Hubbard ([[Laraine Newman]]) \u2013 The town's Bible-thumping, gun-toting old biddy who is appointed [[Tsar|czar]] of [[child and family services]] after a disturbance in the Hills is blamed on valley kids. She is a [[spinster]] who never married or had children.  She wears a [[chastity belt]] called \"The Forni-Guard 2000\".\n\n===The Valley residents===\n* Anita Bidet (Billy West) \u2013 The owner of the bar Pickles frequents, The Rusty Bucket. Her name is a play on the phrase \"I need a [[bidet]].\"  It is implied that she is transgender.  Her assumed male form is seen during a flashback of how Bob and Pickles met, although when questioned about it in the present, Anita claims that she had a brother.\n* Nurse Rench (Laraine Newman) \u2013 The school nurse who is described by Peggy as \"a godless butcher without a shred of legitimate medical training\".  She has a scary operating contraption in place of her right arm, has four breasts arranged in a pattern resembling a cow's udder, and a deformed left hand.\n* James (Billy West) \u2013 Bob's hunchbacked co-worker. He is a people-pleaser and lacks self-esteem, buying friends on [[eBay]] to attend his bachelor party.\n\n===Minor characters===\n* Yvette ([[Michelle Ruff]]) \u2013 An additional member of the Debbies, the only one who does not carry the same name.  An [[Extraterrestrials in fiction|extraterrestrial]] masquerading as a human, she has long blonde hair in a ponytail.  She takes an interest in Milo, though only to experiment on his brain.  When it appears that Milo has been killed, she is forced to self-destruct, as it is more cost-effective than returning to her base of operations.  She only appeared in the episode \"Misfit Love\".\n* Principal Davis ([[Debra Wilson]]) \u2013 The [[African Americans|African-American]] [[Head teacher|school principal]].  She appeared in the episode \"Disfigured Debbie\".\n* Homeless Bill (Billy West) \u2013 Hill Valley's resident street urchin.  He appeared in the episodes \"Narcoleptic Scottie\" and \"Bucketheads\".\n* The Girl with a Beak (Becky Thyre) \u2013 An aptly named, bird-like classmate of The Clubhouse Kids.  She often is spurned by the kids despite their own maladies.  She was never given an actual name.  She appeared in the episodes \"Narcoleptic Scottie\" and \"Bucketheads\".\n* Coach (Will Ferrell) \u2013 Biff and Chip's school coach, with whom Biff has an unhealthy obsession.  He also teaches the [[Sex education|sex]] and [[driver's education]] classes; however, he seems to confuse the two.  He appeared in the episode \"Bucketheads\".\n* Verdelle Diver (Lea DeLaria) \u2013 The regional coordinator of The Li'l Amazons, a [[Girl Scouts of the USA|Girl Scouts]]-like troop.  She and the organization in general are implied to be lesbian (hence her last name, referring to the slur \"muff diver\").  Verdelle hits on Pickles frequently during Pickles' court-ordered tenure as Beth's den mother.  She appeared in the episode \"Pickles' Little Amazons\".\n* Tommy Vinegar (Maurice LaMarche) \u2014 Pickles' ex-boyfriend.  He got rich after Pickles taught him how to be cool and popular, and then promptly dumped her after all his coolness went to his head.  He appeared in the episode \"Bucketheads\".\n* Velva, the Warrior (Pamela Adlon) \u2013 A version of ''[[Xena]]'', whom Beth adores.  Her name is a [[pun]] on \"[[vulva]]\", and her show has heavy lesbian/[[Misandry|anti-male]] overtones (all of the villains are male while all the heroes are female), not to mention blatant advertising of Velva merchandise and numerous genital references. Her sidekick is named Majora, she has a horse named [[Fallopian tube|Fallopious]], and a pet bird named [[Placenta|Placentor]].  She appeared in the episode \"Heroine Addict\".\n* Dusty (Becky Thyre) \u2013 Bob's one-time co-worker and a lifeguard.  It is heavily suggested that she has had a lot of [[Plastic surgery#Cosmetic surgery|cosmetic surgery]].  She appeared in the episode \"My Name Is Robbie\".\n* Courtney (Becky Thyre) \u2013 Chip's girlfriend who only appears in \"Get Off My Back.\" Not much is known about her, but she seems to be live somewhere in the Valley. Her deformity is unknown however. She also gets easily annoyed, as shown when she wishes that Milo would also go into a trance alongside Biff, during a date with Chip and accuses him of trying to grab her breasts. However, she seems to be easily moved, as Milo is able to prevent her from abandoning Chip when he says that his brother thinks she \"has a beautiful soul.\"\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Episode table\n|background=#D1E231\n|overall= \n|title=\n|director=\n|writer=\n|airdate=\n|prodcode=\n|country=US\n|episodes=\n\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=1\n |Title={{anchor|Misfit Love}}Misfit Love\n |DirectedBy = [[Vincent Waller]]\n |WrittenBy = [[Jace Richdale]]\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2001|4|1}}\n |ProdCode = 236-001\n |ShortSummary= Milo Oblong gets transferred to public school after his father, Bob, is taken off his job's insurance for filing too many claims, and falls for a beautiful, popular girl named Yvette who's really an alien.

The series premiered on April 1, 2001 on [[The WB]], and was removed on May 20 of that year, leaving the last five episodes unaired. The remaining episodes were later aired on [[Cartoon Network]]'s late-night programming block [[Adult Swim]], and later aired on [[Teletoon]]'s \"Teletoon Unleashed\" (later become former block [[Teletoon at Night]]) block. The series is loosely based on a series of characters introduced in a picture book entitled ''[[Creepy Susie and 13 Other Tragic Tales for Troubled Children]]''.<ref name=Perlmutter>{{cite book |last1=Perlmutter |first1=David |title=The Encyclopedia of American Animated Television Shows |date=2018 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |isbn=978-1538103739 |page=434}}</ref> \n\nThe show was produced by Jobsite Productions and [[Mohawk Productions]] in association with [[Warner Bros. Television]], and the theme song for the series was composed and performed by [[They Might Be Giants]].\n\nA total of 13 episodes were produced. All thirteen episodes of ''The Oblongs'' were released on DVD on October 4, 2005.\n\n==Setting and premise==\nThe series focuses on the antics of a family who live in a poor valley community, and as a result of pollution and [[radiation]] exposure, are all [[Disability|disabled]] or [[Deformity|deformed]].  The pollution is the direct result of the lavish lifestyle of the rich community known as \"The Hills\", whose residents exploit and harm the valley residents with absolutely no regard for their safety or well-being.\n\n===Social commentary===\nMany reviewers and fans see the series as a [[social commentary|commentary]] on [[social stratification]].<ref name = \"NY Daily News Article\">\"[http://articles.nydailynews.com/2001-03-30/entertainment/18183263_1_pamela-segall-adlon-oblongs-jeannie-elias 'The Oblongs' Shapes Up As A Toxic Treat]\". Eric Mink. New York Daily News. Retrieved November 26, 2012.</ref>\n\n==Characters==\n\n===The Oblong family===\n* {{anchor|Bob}}Bob Oblong ([[Will Ferrell]]) \u2013 Born [[Tetra-amelia syndrome|without arms or legs]], Bob works at a poison factory called the Globocide.  Despite his deformities, he is very chipper and sunny, and is modeled after various fathers from 1950s TV shows.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}  He has a happy-go-lucky attitude.  He is married to Pickles and is the father of Biff, Chip, Milo, and Beth.  The only time he had limbs was in the episode \"My Name is Robbie\". While he mostly uses his mouth for tasking, he can often drive with his mind in various episodes, or read a newspaper with his mind, as seen in \"Flush, Flush, Sweet Helga\", which assumes that he may have mind powers.\n* {{anchor|Pickles}}Pickles Oblong ([[Jean Smart]]) \u2013 A [[chain smoking]] [[Alcoholism|alcoholic]] who was originally a Hill resident but moved to the valley after marrying Bob.  All of her hair has since fallen out (something which is usually hidden by an extremely tall blonde [[beehive (hairstyle)|beehive]] wig) due to the hazardous atmosphere of The Valley, and she is now regarded as an outcast by her former Hill friends. While not bitter about losing her privileged life, she often expresses disdain towards her self-centered former neighbors in the Hills.  She is married to Bob, and is the mother of Biff, Chip, Milo, and Beth.\n* {{anchor|Biff&Chip}}Biff Oblong ([[Randy and Jason Sklar|Randy Sklar]]) and Chip Oblong ([[Randy and Jason Sklar|Jason Sklar]]) \u2013 17-year-old [[conjoined twins]] who are attached at the waist and share a middle leg.  Biff is a hard worker obsessed with sports, while Chip is more laid back.  It is frequently implied that Biff is [[Homosexuality|gay]] and attracted to their coach;{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} however, there are instances when the two are seen lusting after girls together.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}  Biff and Chip each occasionally go into \"trances\" to give the other brother privacy.<ref>Episode 10, \"Get Off My Back\"</ref>\n* {{anchor|Milo}}Milo Oblong ([[Pamela Adlon]]) \u2013 The youngest son. Often referred to by other kids as a \u201cpsycho\u201d, he is afflicted with numerous mental and social disorders and is on \"everything from [[Methylphenidate|Ritalin]] to [[Minoxidil|Rogaine]].\"  Despite his afflictions, he is a very forthright and benevolent boy, though he envies the Hill lifestyle and wishes to rise above his economic status.  He has a single hair sticking up on his head, a squint in one eye (which also occasionally twitches) and often wears a shirt that says \"NO\".\n* {{anchor|Beth}}Beth Oblong ([[Jeannie Elias]]) \u2013 The youngest child and only daughter, she has a warty, elongated growth growing out of her head. Despite her appendage, she is shown to be better adjusted than the rest of her family. In the episode \"Pickles' Lil' Amazons\", it is revealed that the growth on her head is the result of eating meat containing bovine growth hormones. In the episode \"My Name is Robbie\", it is revealed that her birthday is June 7.\n* Grammy Oblong \u2013 Bob's [[Persistent vegetative state|vegetative]] mother who resides in a [[motorized wheelchair]] and is [[Muteness|unable to speak]]. Instead, she communicates using a green light which means yes, a red light which means no, and a flashing red light which means she has soiled herself and that her diapers need changing.\n* {{anchor|Lucky}}Lucky \u2013 The one-lunged family cat who chain-smokes cigarettes and wears an uninterested, deadpan expression.\n* Scottie \u2013 Milo's [[Narcolepsy|narcoleptic]] dog, a result of perfume used on him during his tenure as a test animal at Globocide. Scottie was based on the short story \"Narcoleptic Scottie\" in ''Creepy Susie''.\n\n===Milo's friends, \"The Clubhouse Kids\"===\n* Helga Phugly ([[Lea DeLaria]]) \u2013 A fat, toad-like girl who will eat virtually anything. She lives in a fantasy world, believing that she is pretty and popular and that the \"Debbies'\" actually like her (she stubbornly believes this, as when told that the Debbies hate her, she covered her ears, shut her eyes, and started stomping around humming very loudly).  At times, she is shown to have a [[Puppy love|crush]] on Milo, leading to her kidnapping him in the episode \"Milo Interrupted\". When her parents went on vacation and never returned, Helga was forced to live at home by herself, eating only rejected wedding cakes from a nearby wedding cake factory and the occasional animal that she spotted.  Milo eventually locates her parents when Mrs. Hubbard, a Bible-thumping, gun-toting old woman, tries to adopt Helga.<ref>\"Milo Interrupted\"</ref>  Her last name, Phugly, is derived from the word \"fugly\", which is a term short for \"fucking ugly\".\n* [[Creepy Susie and 13 Other Tragic Tales for Troubled Children|Creepy Susie]] (Jeannie Elias) \u2013 A girl who speaks with a [[deadpan]] French accent and appears to float instead of walk, as her legs are never shown.  She is obsessed with [[death]], and has a problem with [[pyromania]], but it has been revealed she does enjoy [[hula hoop]]s.\n* Peggy (Becky Thyre) \u2013 A one-breasted girl who lacks a lower jaw, causing her to spit and talk with a [[lisp]].  Despite her deformities, Peggy is cheerful and upbeat.  The daughter of a gay couple, she dreams of being president and marrying a handsome [[Speech-language pathology|speech therapist]].\n* Mikey (Jeannie Elias) \u2013 A boy saddled with a dangling, doubled posterior. Standard [[Undergarment|underwear]] will not fit him, so he wears his grandmother's old [[bra]] like backwards [[suspenders]].  He is also known to habitually probe his nose and ears with his finger. Because of his larger deformed posterior, he takes jokes about the area more literally especially since they often come true soon after. As a running gag, he is inflicted with severe misfortune in almost every appearance, ranging from being stung by bees to being attacked by dogs.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}\n\n===The Hill residents===\n* George Klimer ([[Billy West (voice actor)|Billy West]]) \u2013 Bob's rich and [[snobby]] boss. He represents the power and arrogance of the people of the Hills.  He is very condescending to his employees, especially Bob and James. He is husband to Pristine and father of Jared and Debbie Klimer.\n* Pristine Klimer (Becky Thyre) \u2013 The wife of George and mother to Jared and Debbie. Pristine was good friends with Pickles before she married Bob, but abandoned her once she went to live in the valley.\n* Jared Klimer (Pamela Adlon) \u2013 The arrogant son of George and Pristine and brother to Debbie.  He likes to taunt The Clubhouse Kids, along with his equally snobbish best friend Blaine. He calls Milo \"Obdong\". In the episode \"Get Off My Back\", Milo retorts with the information that a rumor of Jared and Blaine claims the two have had sex with each other.\n* Debbie Klimer (Becky Thyre; Pamela Segall Adlon, in some episodes) - The only daughter of George and Pristine Klimer, and sister of Jared. She is the leader of \"The Debbies\" and is considered the most beautiful and popular girl in school, even though all of her friends are identical. Like most Hill residents, she often treats the people in the Valley with cruelty. She is the only Debbie with her last name known, besides Debbie Bledsoe.\n* The Debbies (Becky Thyre, Pamela Adlon in some episodes) \u2013 A popular [[clique]] of identical girls who dress alike and happen to all be named Debbie. Despite them all being identical to one another, each Debbie is the daughter of a different wealthy Hill resident, with no relation. They seem to be a symbol of how most popular people tend to be conformists and lack originality and difference, hence why they are all named Debbie and have the same appearance. The Debbies are often cruel to the valley kids, especially Helga who aspires to be accepted by them.\n* Mayor Johnny \"The Mayor\" Bledsoe (Billy West) \u2013 The town's mayor and a masked [[professional wrestling|pro wrestler]].  He is corrupt, and his daughter is a Debbie.\n* Leland Bergstein (Billy West) \u2013 The kids' homeroom teacher, who is shown to be weak and easily cowed by the Debbies and the rich residents of the town. It is revealed that he lives in the Hills, as seen in the episode \"Milo Interrupted\".\n* Sheriff Pepper ([[Maurice LaMarche]]) \u2013 Hill Valley's inept, corrupt law enforcer.  He favors the people of the Hills and provides better law enforcement for them.\n* Dr. Hofschneider (Billy West) \u2013 The Oblongs' condescending and uninterested doctor.\n* Mrs. Hubbard ([[Laraine Newman]]) \u2013 The town's Bible-thumping, gun-toting old biddy who is appointed [[Tsar|czar]] of [[child and family services]] after a disturbance in the Hills is blamed on valley kids. She is a [[spinster]] who never married or had children.  She wears a [[chastity belt]] called \"The Forni-Guard 2000\".\n\n===The Valley residents===\n* Anita Bidet (Billy West) \u2013 The owner of the bar Pickles frequents, The Rusty Bucket. Her name is a play on the phrase \"I need a [[bidet]].\"  It is implied that she is transgender.  Her assumed male form is seen during a flashback of how Bob and Pickles met, although when questioned about it in the present, Anita claims that she had a brother.\n* Nurse Rench (Laraine Newman) \u2013 The school nurse who is described by Peggy as \"a godless butcher without a shred of legitimate medical training\".  She has a scary operating contraption in place of her right arm, has four breasts arranged in a pattern resembling a cow's udder, and a deformed left hand.\n* James (Billy West) \u2013 Bob's hunchbacked co-worker. He is a people-pleaser and lacks self-esteem, buying friends on [[eBay]] to attend his bachelor party.\n\n===Minor characters===\n* Yvette ([[Michelle Ruff]]) \u2013 An additional member of the Debbies, the only one who does not carry the same name.  An [[Extraterrestrials in fiction|extraterrestrial]] masquerading as a human, she has long blonde hair in a ponytail.  She takes an interest in Milo, though only to experiment on his brain.  When it appears that Milo has been killed, she is forced to self-destruct, as it is more cost-effective than returning to her base of operations.  She only appeared in the episode \"Misfit Love\".\n* Principal Davis ([[Debra Wilson]]) \u2013 The [[African Americans|African-American]] [[Head teacher|school principal]].  She appeared in the episode \"Disfigured Debbie\".\n* Homeless Bill (Billy West) \u2013 Hill Valley's resident street urchin.  He appeared in the episodes \"Narcoleptic Scottie\" and \"Bucketheads\".\n* The Girl with a Beak (Becky Thyre) \u2013 An aptly named, bird-like classmate of The Clubhouse Kids.  She often is spurned by the kids despite their own maladies.  She was never given an actual name.  She appeared in the episodes \"Narcoleptic Scottie\" and \"Bucketheads\".\n* Coach (Will Ferrell) \u2013 Biff and Chip's school coach, with whom Biff has an unhealthy obsession.  He also teaches the [[Sex education|sex]] and [[driver's education]] classes; however, he seems to confuse the two.  He appeared in the episode \"Bucketheads\".\n* Verdelle Diver (Lea DeLaria) \u2013 The regional coordinator of The Li'l Amazons, a [[Girl Scouts of the USA|Girl Scouts]]-like troop.  She and the organization in general are implied to be lesbian (hence her last name, referring to the slur \"muff diver\").  Verdelle hits on Pickles frequently during Pickles' court-ordered tenure as Beth's den mother.  She appeared in the episode \"Pickles' Little Amazons\".\n* Tommy Vinegar (Maurice LaMarche) \u2014 Pickles' ex-boyfriend.  He got rich after Pickles taught him how to be cool and popular, and then promptly dumped her after all his coolness went to his head.  He appeared in the episode \"Bucketheads\".\n* Velva, the Warrior (Pamela Adlon) \u2013 A version of ''[[Xena]]'', whom Beth adores.  Her name is a [[pun]] on \"[[vulva]]\", and her show has heavy lesbian/[[Misandry|anti-male]] overtones (all of the villains are male while all the heroes are female), not to mention blatant advertising of Velva merchandise and numerous genital references. Her sidekick is named Majora, she has a horse named [[Fallopian tube|Fallopious]], and a pet bird named [[Placenta|Placentor]].  She appeared in the episode \"Heroine Addict\".\n* Dusty (Becky Thyre) \u2013 Bob's one-time co-worker and a lifeguard.  It is heavily suggested that she has had a lot of [[Plastic surgery#Cosmetic surgery|cosmetic surgery]].  She appeared in the episode \"My Name Is Robbie\".\n* Courtney (Becky Thyre) \u2013 Chip's girlfriend who only appears in \"Get Off My Back.\" Not much is known about her, but she seems to be live somewhere in the Valley. Her deformity is unknown however. She also gets easily annoyed, as shown when she wishes that Milo would also go into a trance alongside Biff, during a date with Chip and accuses him of trying to grab her breasts. However, she seems to be easily moved, as Milo is able to prevent her from abandoning Chip when he says that his brother thinks she \"has a beautiful soul.\"\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Episode table\n|background=#D1E231\n|overall= \n|title=\n|director=\n|writer=\n|airdate=\n|prodcode=\n|country=US\n|episodes=\n\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=1\n |Title={{anchor|Misfit Love}}Misfit Love\n |DirectedBy = [[Vincent Waller]]\n |WrittenBy = [[Jace Richdale]]\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2001|4|1}}\n |ProdCode = 236-001\n |ShortSummary= Milo Oblong gets transferred to public school after his father, Bob, is taken off his job's insurance for filing too many claims, and falls for a beautiful, popular girl named Yvette who's really an alien.
