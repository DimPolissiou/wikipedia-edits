Lawrence planned to search for the location of a lost city somewhere in the sands, telling a fellow traveller that he was convinced that the remains of an Arab civilization were to be found in the desert. He had been told that the Bedu had seen the ruins of the castles of King Ad in the region of [[Iram of the Pillars|Wabar]]. In his view the best way to explore the sands was by airship, but his plans never came to fruition.<ref>{{cite book\n |last=Lawrence\n |first=T. E.\n |date=1964\n |title=The letters of T.E.

Like Thesiger, the party approached Shisr from the south, along the Wadi Ghudun. Their first sight of Ash Shisur was a white cliff in the distance.

St. John Philby (who preferred the name \"Wabar\") was an English adviser to Emir Aziz bin Saud in Riyadh. He first heard the story of Ubar from his Bedouin guide who told him about a place of ruined castles where King Ad had stabled his horses and housed his women before being punished for his sinful ways by being destroyed by fire from heaven.<ref name=\"Wynn, J.C. 1998, pp. 64-71\">{{cite magazine\n| last1      = Wynn\n| first1     = Jeffrey C.\n| last2      = Shoemaker\n| first2     = Eugene M.\n| date = November 1998\n| title      = The Day the Sands Caught Fire\n| url        = https://volcanoes.usgs.gov/jwynn/1998SciAm-Wabar.pdf\n| magazine   = [[Scientific American]]\n| pages      = 64\u201371\n| publisher  = [[Springer Nature]]\n| access-date= 2019-11-17\n}}</ref>\n\nAnxious to seal his reputation as a great explorer, Philby went in search of the lost city of Wabar but, instead of finding ruins, discovered what he described as extinct volcano half-buried in the sands or, possibly, the remnants of a [[Wabar craters|meteorite impact]].

This was a place marked on a map of Arabia compiled by [[Claudius Ptolemy]] in about 150 AD.<ref name=\"RF\"/>\n\n===Various===\nWhen the explorer [[Freya Stark]] consulted the works of Arab geographers, she found a wide range of opinions as to the location of Wabar: \u201c[[Yaqut al-Hamawi|Yaqut]] says: \"In Yemen is the qaria of Wabar.\" El-Laith, quoted by Yaqut, puts it between the sands of [[Yabrin]] and Yemen. [[Ibn Ishaq]]\u2026 places it between \"Sabub (unknown to Yaqut and Hamdani) and the [[Hadhramaut]]\". [[Abu Muhammad al-Hasan al-Hamdani|Hamdani]], a very reliable man, places it between [[Najran Region|Najran]], Hadhramaut, [[Ash-Shihr|Shihr]] and Mahra. Yaqut, presumably citing Hamdani, puts it between the boundaries of Shihr and [[Sana\u02bda]], and then, on the authority of Abu Mundhir between the sands of B.Sa'd (near Yabrin) and Shihr and Mahra. Abu Mundhir puts it between Hadhramaut and Najran.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith such evidence,\u201d Stark concluded, \u201cit seems quite possible for Mr. Thomas and Mr. Philby each to find Wabar in an opposite corner of Arabia.\u201d<ref>{{cite book\n |last=Stark\n |first=Freya \n |date=1936\n |title=The southern gates of Arabia\n |location=New York\n |publisher=[[E.

Clapp had just returned from Oman, having helped to stock an oryx sanctuary on the Jiddat al Harassis, and was inspired by Thomas' references to the lost city of Ubar.\nHe began his search for Ubar in the library of the [[University of California in Los Angeles]], and found a 2nd-century AD map by the Alexandrian geographer Claudius Ptolemy which showed a place called \"Omanum Emporium\". He speculated that this might be the location of Ubar, situated on the incense route between Dhofar and the Mediterranean region. Aware that Mayan remains had been identified from aerial photographs, Clapp contacted NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and obtained satellite images of Dhofar. These helped to identify ancient camel tracks hidden beneath the shifting sands of the desert which in turn might identify places of convergence such as wells and ancient cities.<ref name=\"NC\"/>\n\nAfter Clapp's team had visited a number of possible sites for Ubar, they found themselves drawn back to the crumbling ruin at Shisr. Although the fort had been written off as being no more than a few hundred years old by the earlier explorers, Clapp's team began to speculate that the fort had been rebuilt in the 1500s on the remains of a far more ancient site.\n\nUnder the direction of Dr. [[Juris Zarins]], the team began excavation, and within weeks had unearthed the wall and towers of a fortress dating back more than 2,000 years. Clapp suggested that the evidence was \"a convincing match\" for the legendary lost city of Ubar. The city's destruction, he postulated, happened between A.D. 300 and 500 as the result of an earthquake which precipitated the collapse of the limestone table; but it was the decline of the incense trade, which led to the decline of the caravan routes through Shisr, that sealed Ubar's fate.\n\nZarins himself concluded that Shisr did not represent a city called Ubar.<ref name=\"zarins1\" /> In a 1996 interview on the subject of Ubar, he said:\n{{quote|text=There's a lot of confusion about that word. If you look at the classical texts and the Arab historical sources, Ubar refers to a region and a group of people, not to a specific town. People always overlook that. It's very clear on Ptolemy's second century map of the area. It says in big letters \"Iobaritae\". And in his text that accompanied the maps, he's very clear about that. It was only the late medieval version of ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'', in the fourteenth or fifteenth century, that romanticised Ubar and turned it into a city, rather than a region or a people.\"<ref>{{cite interview |last=Zarins |first=Juris |title=Interview with Dr. Juris Zarins |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/ubar/zarins/ |date=September 1996 |work=[[PBS Nova]] Online |access-date=27 June 2013}}</ref>}}\n\nIn a more recent paper he suggested that modern Habarut may be the site of Ubar.<ref>{{cite journal\n| last       = Zarins\n| first      = Juris\n| editor1-last  = Bawden\n| editor1-first = Garth\n| editor2-last  = Reycraft\n| editor2-first = Richard Martin\n| date       = 2000\n| title      = Environmental disruption and human response: an archaeological-historical example from south Arabia\n| journal    = Environmental Disaster and the Archaeology of Human Response\n| series     = Anthropological papers\n| publisher  = [[Maxwell Museum of Anthropology]]\n| location   = Albuquerque, NM\n| volume     = 7\n| pages      = 35\u201349\n| oclc = 45708208\n}}</ref>\n\nBy 2007, following further research and excavation, their findings could be summarised as follows:<ref>{{cite journal\n| last1      = Blom\n| first1     = Ronald G.\n| last2      = Crippen\n| first2     = Robert\n| last3      = Elachi\n| first3     = Charles\n| author3-link = Charles Elachi\n| last4      = Clapp\n| first4     = Nicholas\n| last5      = Hedges\n| first5     = George R.\n| author5-link = George Hedges\n| last6      = Zarins\n| first6     = Juris\n| editor1-first = James\n| editor1-last  = Wiseman\n| editor2-first = Farouk\n| editor2-last  = El-Baz\n| date       = 2006\n| title      = Southern Arabian Desert Trade Routes, Frankincense, Myrrh, and the Ubar Legend\n| journal    = Remote Sensing in Archaeology\n| publisher  = [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]]\n| location   = New York\n| pages      = 71\u201387\n| doi        = 10.1007/0-387-44455-6_3\n| isbn       = 978-0-387-44455-0\n| series = Interdisciplinary Contributions to Archaeology\n| url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/ae1ba0acaa3f85b06dbc611b41be4339dc968cb1\n}}</ref>\n\n* A long period of widespread trade through the area of Shisr was indicated by artefacts from Persia, Rome, and Greece being found on the site. More recent work in Oman and Yemen indicated that this fortress was the easternmost remains of a series of desert [[caravanserais]] that supported incense trade.\n* As far as the legend of Ubar was concerned, there was no evidence that the city had perished in a sandstorm. Much of the fortress had collapsed into a sinkhole that hosted the well, perhaps undermined by ground water being taken to irrigate the surrounding oasis.\n* Rather than being a city, interpretation of the evidence suggested that \u201cUbar\u201d was more likely to have been a region\u2014the \u201cLand of the Iobaritae\u201d identified by Ptolemy. The decline of the region was probably due to a reduction in the frankincense trade caused by the conversion of the Roman Empire to Christianity, which did not require incense in the same quantities for its rituals. Also, it became difficult to find local labour to collect the resin.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Lawton|first=John|title=Oman: Frankincense|magazine=[[Saudi Aramco World]]|date=May\u2013June 1983|volume=34|issue=3|pages=26\u201327|url=https://archive.aramcoworld.com/issue/198303/oman-frankincense.htm|accessdate=1 January 2015}}</ref> Climatic changes led to desiccation of the area, and sea transport became a more reliable way of transporting goods.\n* The archaeological importance of the site was highlighted by satellite imagery that revealed a network of trails, some of which passed underneath sand dunes 100 m tall, which converged on Shisr. Image analysis showed no further evidence of major undocumented sites in this desert region, which might be considered as alternate locations for the Ubar of legend.\n\n{{commonscatinline|Shisr, Dhofar province, Oman}}\n\n==Critical reception==\nThe Saudi Arabian press was generally sceptical about the discovery of Ubar in Oman, with Dr. Abdullah al Masri, Assistant Under-Secretary of Archaeological Affairs stating that similar sites had been found in Saudi Arabia over the past 15 years.  In ''Ashawq al Awsat'' he explained: \u201cThe best of these sites was when, in 1975, we uncovered more than one city on the edge of the Empty Quarter, in particular the oasis on Jabreen. Also the name of Ubar is similar to that of Obar, an oasis in eastern Saudi Arabia. We must await further details but so far we have far more important discoveries at Jabreen or Najran.\u201d However, Professor Mohammed Bakalla of King Saud University wrote that he would not be surprised if Ad\u2019s nation cities were found underneath the Shisr excavation or in the close vicinity.<ref name=\"RF\"/>\n\nMore recent academic opinion is less than convinced about the accuracy of Clapp\u2019s findings. One reviewer noted that Clapp himself did not help matters by including a speculative chapter about the king of Ubar in his book, ''The Road to Ubar'', which in his view undermined his narrative authority: \u201cits fictional drama pales next to the gripping real-life story of the Ubar expedition recounted in earlier portions of this volume.\u201d<ref>{{cite news\n| last         = Kakutani\n| first        = Michiko\n| date         = 1998-02-27\n| title        = Stumbling Upon the Desert's Secret\n| url          = https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/books/98/02/22/daily/ubar-book-review.html\n| work         = The New York Times\n| location     = \n| access-date  = 2019-11-16\n}}</ref>\n\nThe case for Shisr being Omanum Emporium has been questioned by recent research.  Nigel Groom commented in an article \u201cOman and the Emirates in Ptolemy's Map\u201d published in 2007, that Ptolemy\u2019s map of Arabia contained many wild distortions.  The word \u201cEmporium\u201d in the original Greek meant a place for wholesale trade of commodities carried by sea, and was sometimes an inland city where taxes were collected and trade conducted. Thus the term could be applied to a town that was some distance from the coast. This, Groom suggests, may have been the case with Ptolemy\u2019s \u2019Omanum Emporium\u2019. He suggested that the Hormanus River, the source of which is marked on Ptolemy\u2019s map as being north-east of Omanus Emporium, was in fact the Wadi Halfrain which rises some 20 kilometres north east of Izki in modern-day central Oman. Thus, Groom concludes, Omanum Emprorium was likely to have been located at Izki, possibly Nizwa, or in their vicinity.<ref>{{cite journal\n| last       = Groom\n| first      = Nigel\n| date       = August 1994\n| title      = Oman and the Emirates in Ptolemy's map\n| journal    = [[Arabian Archaeology and Epigraphy]]\n| publisher  = [[Blackwell Publishing]]\n| volume     = 5\n| issue      = 3\n| pages      = 198\u2013214\n| doi        = 10.1111/j.1600-0471.1994.tb00067.x\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal\n| last       = Groom\n| first      = Nigel\n| date       = Spring 2000\n| title      = The Road to Ubar\u2014Pros and Cons\n| journal    = Bulletin of the Society for Arabian Studies\n| publisher  = Society for Arabian Studies\n| volume     = 5\n| pages      = 42\u201343\n}}</ref>\n\nH.

T. E.

Like Thesiger, the party approached Shisr from the south, along the Wadi Ghudun. Their first sight of Ash Shisur was a white cliff in the distance.

Iram, for example, was described in the Qur'an as follows: \"Have you not considered how your Lord dealt with 'Aad - [with] Iram - who had lofty pillars, The like of which were not produced in (all) the land?\" (Surat al-Fajr: 6\u20138)<ref>{{cite web|title=The lost city of Ubar|url=http://www.islam101.com/archeology/ubar.html|website=Islam 101|accessdate=27 June 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Theories about the location of a lost city of the sands==\n\n===Dhofar===\nBertram Thomas' guide pointed to wide tracks between the dunes and said: \u201cLook, Sahib, there is the way to Ubar.

St. John Philby (who preferred the name \"Wabar\") was an English adviser to Emir Aziz bin Saud in Riyadh. He first heard the story of Ubar from his Bedouin guide who told him about a place of ruined castles where King Ad had stabled his horses and housed his women before being punished for his sinful ways by being destroyed by fire from heaven.<ref name=\"Wynn, J.C. 1998, pp. 64-71\">{{cite magazine\n| last1      = Wynn\n| first1     = Jeffrey C.\n| last2      = Shoemaker\n| first2     = Eugene M.\n| date = November 1998\n| title      = The Day the Sands Caught Fire\n| url        = https://volcanoes.usgs.gov/jwynn/1998SciAm-Wabar.pdf\n| magazine   = [[Scientific American]]\n| pages      = 64\u201371\n| publisher  = [[Springer Nature]]\n| access-date= 2019-11-17\n}}</ref>\n\nAnxious to seal his reputation as a great explorer, Philby went in search of the lost city of Wabar but, instead of finding ruins, discovered what he described as extinct volcano half-buried in the sands or, possibly, the remnants of a [[Wabar craters|meteorite impact]].

This was a place marked on a map of Arabia compiled by [[Claudius Ptolemy]] in about 150 AD.<ref name=\"RF\"/>\n\n===Various===\nWhen the explorer [[Freya Stark]] consulted the works of Arab geographers, she found a wide range of opinions as to the location of Wabar: \u201c[[Yaqut al-Hamawi|Yaqut]] says: \"In Yemen is the qaria of Wabar.\" El-Laith, quoted by Yaqut, puts it between the sands of [[Yabrin]] and Yemen. [[Ibn Ishaq]]\u2026 places it between \"Sabub (unknown to Yaqut and Hamdani) and the [[Hadhramaut]]\". [[Abu Muhammad al-Hasan al-Hamdani|Hamdani]], a very reliable man, places it between [[Najran Region|Najran]], Hadhramaut, [[Ash-Shihr|Shihr]] and Mahra. Yaqut, presumably citing Hamdani, puts it between the boundaries of Shihr and [[Sana\u02bda]], and then, on the authority of Abu Mundhir between the sands of B.Sa'd (near Yabrin) and Shihr and Mahra. Abu Mundhir puts it between Hadhramaut and Najran.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith such evidence,\u201d Stark concluded, \u201cit seems quite possible for Mr. Thomas and Mr. Philby each to find Wabar in an opposite corner of Arabia.\u201d<ref>{{cite book\n |last=Stark\n |first=Freya \n |date=1936\n |title=The southern gates of Arabia\n |location=New York\n |publisher=[[E.

Clapp had just returned from Oman, having helped to stock an oryx sanctuary on the Jiddat al Harassis, and was inspired by Thomas' references to the lost city of Ubar.\nHe began his search for Ubar in the library of the [[University of California in Los Angeles]], and found a 2nd-century AD map by the Alexandrian geographer Claudius Ptolemy which showed a place called \"Omanum Emporium\". He speculated that this might be the location of Ubar, situated on the incense route between Dhofar and the Mediterranean region. Aware that Mayan remains had been identified from aerial photographs, Clapp contacted NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and obtained satellite images of Dhofar. These helped to identify ancient camel tracks hidden beneath the shifting sands of the desert which in turn might identify places of convergence such as wells and ancient cities.<ref name=\"NC\"/>\n\nAfter Clapp's team had visited a number of possible sites for Ubar, they found themselves drawn back to the crumbling ruin at Shisr. Although the fort had been written off as being no more than a few hundred years old by the earlier explorers, Clapp's team began to speculate that the fort had been rebuilt in the 1500s on the remains of a far more ancient site.\n\nUnder the direction of Dr. [[Juris Zarins]], the team began excavation, and within weeks had unearthed the wall and towers of a fortress dating back more than 2,000 years. Clapp suggested that the evidence was \"a convincing match\" for the legendary lost city of Ubar. The city's destruction, he postulated, happened between A.D. 300 and 500 as the result of an earthquake which precipitated the collapse of the limestone table; but it was the decline of the incense trade, which led to the decline of the caravan routes through Shisr, that sealed Ubar's fate.\n\nZarins himself concluded that Shisr did not represent a city called Ubar.<ref name=\"zarins1\" /> In a 1996 interview on the subject of Ubar, he said:\n{{quote|text=There's a lot of confusion about that word. If you look at the classical texts and the Arab historical sources, Ubar refers to a region and a group of people, not to a specific town. People always overlook that. It's very clear on Ptolemy's second century map of the area. It says in big letters \"Iobaritae\". And in his text that accompanied the maps, he's very clear about that. It was only the late medieval version of ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'', in the fourteenth or fifteenth century, that romanticised Ubar and turned it into a city, rather than a region or a people.\"<ref>{{cite interview |last=Zarins |first=Juris |title=Interview with Dr. Juris Zarins |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/ubar/zarins/ |date=September 1996 |work=[[PBS Nova]] Online |access-date=27 June 2013}}</ref>}}\n\nIn a more recent paper he suggested that modern Habarut may be the site of Ubar.<ref>{{cite journal\n| last       = Zarins\n| first      = Juris\n| editor1-last  = Bawden\n| editor1-first = Garth\n| editor2-last  = Reycraft\n| editor2-first = Richard Martin\n| date       = 2000\n| title      = Environmental disruption and human response: an archaeological-historical example from south Arabia\n| journal    = Environmental Disaster and the Archaeology of Human Response\n| series     = Anthropological papers\n| publisher  = [[Maxwell Museum of Anthropology]]\n| location   = Albuquerque, NM\n| volume     = 7\n| pages      = 35\u201349\n| oclc = 45708208\n}}</ref>\n\nBy 2007, following further research and excavation, their findings could be summarised as follows:<ref>{{cite journal\n| last1      = Blom\n| first1     = Ronald G.\n| last2      = Crippen\n| first2     = Robert\n| last3      = Elachi\n| first3     = Charles\n| author3-link = Charles Elachi\n| last4      = Clapp\n| first4     = Nicholas\n| last5      = Hedges\n| first5     = George R.\n| author5-link = George Hedges\n| last6      = Zarins\n| first6     = Juris\n| editor1-first = James\n| editor1-last  = Wiseman\n| editor2-first = Farouk\n| editor2-last  = El-Baz\n| date       = 2006\n| title      = Southern Arabian Desert Trade Routes, Frankincense, Myrrh, and the Ubar Legend\n| journal    = Remote Sensing in Archaeology\n| publisher  = [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]]\n| location   = New York\n| pages      = 71\u201387\n| doi        = 10.1007/0-387-44455-6_3\n| isbn       = 978-0-387-44455-0\n| series = Interdisciplinary Contributions to Archaeology\n| url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/ae1ba0acaa3f85b06dbc611b41be4339dc968cb1\n}}</ref>\n\n* A long period of widespread trade through the area of Shisr was indicated by artefacts from Persia, Rome, and Greece being found on the site. More recent work in Oman and Yemen indicated that this fortress was the easternmost remains of a series of desert [[caravanserais]] that supported incense trade.\n* As far as the legend of Ubar was concerned, there was no evidence that the city had perished in a sandstorm. Much of the fortress had collapsed into a sinkhole that hosted the well, perhaps undermined by ground water being taken to irrigate the surrounding oasis.\n* Rather than being a city, interpretation of the evidence suggested that \u201cUbar\u201d was more likely to have been a region\u2014the \u201cLand of the Iobaritae\u201d identified by Ptolemy. The decline of the region was probably due to a reduction in the frankincense trade caused by the conversion of the Roman Empire to Christianity, which did not require incense in the same quantities for its rituals. Also, it became difficult to find local labour to collect the resin.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Lawton|first=John|title=Oman: Frankincense|magazine=[[Saudi Aramco World]]|date=May\u2013June 1983|volume=34|issue=3|pages=26\u201327|url=https://archive.aramcoworld.com/issue/198303/oman-frankincense.htm|accessdate=1 January 2015}}</ref> Climatic changes led to desiccation of the area, and sea transport became a more reliable way of transporting goods.\n* The archaeological importance of the site was highlighted by satellite imagery that revealed a network of trails, some of which passed underneath sand dunes 100 m tall, which converged on Shisr. Image analysis showed no further evidence of major undocumented sites in this desert region, which might be considered as alternate locations for the Ubar of legend.\n\n{{commonscatinline|Shisr, Dhofar province, Oman}}\n\n==Critical reception==\nThe Saudi Arabian press was generally sceptical about the discovery of Ubar in Oman, with Dr. Abdullah al Masri, Assistant Under-Secretary of Archaeological Affairs stating that similar sites had been found in Saudi Arabia over the past 15 years.  In ''Ashawq al Awsat'' he explained: \u201cThe best of these sites was when, in 1975, we uncovered more than one city on the edge of the Empty Quarter, in particular the oasis on Jabreen. Also the name of Ubar is similar to that of Obar, an oasis in eastern Saudi Arabia. We must await further details but so far we have far more important discoveries at Jabreen or Najran.\u201d However, Professor Mohammed Bakalla of King Saud University wrote that he would not be surprised if Ad\u2019s nation cities were found underneath the Shisr excavation or in the close vicinity.<ref name=\"RF\"/>\n\nMore recent academic opinion is less than convinced about the accuracy of Clapp\u2019s findings. One reviewer noted that Clapp himself did not help matters by including a speculative chapter about the king of Ubar in his book, ''The Road to Ubar'', which in his view undermined his narrative authority: \u201cits fictional drama pales next to the gripping real-life story of the Ubar expedition recounted in earlier portions of this volume.\u201d<ref>{{cite news\n| last         = Kakutani\n| first        = Michiko\n| date         = 1998-02-27\n| title        = Stumbling Upon the Desert's Secret\n| url          = https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/books/98/02/22/daily/ubar-book-review.html\n| work         = [[New York Times]]\n| location     = \n| access-date  = 2019-11-16\n}}</ref>\n\nThe case for Shisr being Omanum Emporium has been questioned by recent research.  Nigel Groom commented in an article \u201cOman and the Emirates in Ptolemy's Map\u201d published in 2007, that Ptolemy\u2019s map of Arabia contained many wild distortions.  The word \u201cEmporium\u201d in the original Greek meant a place for wholesale trade of commodities carried by sea, and was sometimes an inland city where taxes were collected and trade conducted. Thus the term could be applied to a town that was some distance from the coast. This, Groom suggests, may have been the case with Ptolemy\u2019s \u2019Omanum Emporium\u2019. He suggested that the Hormanus River, the source of which is marked on Ptolemy\u2019s map as being north-east of Omanus Emporium, was in fact the Wadi Halfrain which rises some 20 kilometres north east of Izki in modern-day central Oman. Thus, Groom concludes, Omanum Emprorium was likely to have been located at Izki, possibly Nizwa, or in their vicinity.<ref>{{cite journal\n| last       = Groom\n| first      = Nigel\n| date       = August 1994\n| title      = Oman and the Emirates in Ptolemy's map\n| journal    = [[Arabian Archaeology and Epigraphy]]\n| publisher  = [[Blackwell Publishing]]\n| volume     = 5\n| issue      = 3\n| pages      = 198\u2013214\n| doi        = 10.1111/j.1600-0471.1994.tb00067.x\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal\n| last       = Groom\n| first      = Nigel\n| date       = Spring 2000\n| title      = The Road to Ubar\u2014Pros and Cons\n| journal    = Bulletin of the Society for Arabian Studies\n| publisher  = Society for Arabian Studies\n| volume     = 5\n| pages      = 42\u201343\n}}</ref>\n\nH.

Edgell suggested that the building was small and used by a few families at most.

Acting is the second most consumed of all the arts... Yet there had been almost no serious intellectual thought given to how the form actually works. And actors had bought into the mediocrity that had been fed to them. Actors had actually agreed to call what they do a craft rather than an art. But surely an actor who plays Laertes in a production of ''Hamlet'' has way more to do with the success or failure of the evening than the third violinist has to do with the success or failure of a Beethoven symphony. Yet, you would never hear a violist refer to what they do as a craft\u2014never! So I started changing that, inventing new ways for actors to understand their art...<ref name=\"Clare2\" /></blockquote>In the parish hall basement, Rotenberg would quietly observe as his students videotaped themselves performing short scenes in pairs or on their own, gathering around a television set to watch the tape afterwards, and he would step in, offering blunt but constructive criticism of their scene, at the same time protecting their fragile egos with his humour - and his acuity as a teacher.<ref name=\"Intini\" /> One of his students, having worked with Rotenberg for six years, often travelling home from Los Angeles to take his classes, said Rotenberg is \"great at making us see our strengths and weaknesses.\"<ref name=\"Intini\" />\n\n===Author (1998- )===\nThe \"shunning\" Rotenberg felt from the Toronto theatrical community pushed him toward writing, both [[film scripts]], at least \nfive of which have been optioned by film companies,<ref name=\"York\" /> stage plays, such as his adaptation of ''[[The Great Gatsby]]'', which he directed at both York and [[Penn State University]],<ref name=\"Workaday\" /> and his highly successful [[novels]]. In his words, \"this shunning sent me to writing, so it worked out for the best.\"<ref name=\"Clare2\" /> An early example is his original screenplay ''Ambition's Debt'', which he was also minded to direct using only Canadian talent to fill the credits.<ref name=\"Intini\" />\n{{Quote box\n| quote  = It is a pleasure to read intelligent thrillers by Canadian writers.

Constantine]], and [[James Crumley]], as well as [[playwright]] [[Robert Litz]], who approached him in New York to work on a screenplay together, and a \"junior high school English teacher named Mr. Gallanders ... who encouraged me to read and write.\"<ref name=\"Open\" /> He went on to include [[Aaron Sorkin]] and [[Bob Dylan]], \"especially when he's not singing his songs.\"<ref name=\"Open\" />\n\nAs his first five novels were [[police procedurals]], he purposefully had his writing space cluttered with images and books: \"two large modern desks at right angles to each other \u2014 the whole thing dominated by a large computer monitor. It felt that the job was to produce order from the chaos \u2014 just as police officers must.\"<ref name=\"Desk\" /> For ''The Junction Chronicles'', he felt he needed a different kind of workspace for a different kind of literary work, \"spare \u2014 filled with leaps in time and space, often defying normal rules of storytelling\", pushing the boundaries: \"Here the job has to do with entering blank spaces \u2014 creating from whole cloth.\"<ref name=\"Desk\" /> It took him seven weeks and three days of \"intense looking\" to find the desk for his new office. Made from reclaimed wood, and only   a foot and a half deep and about four and half feet long, it is \"a piece of art in and of itself.\"<ref name=\"Desk\" /> The desk has no drawers or file cabinets nor in and out trays, just a small laptop. \"Even the hard copies of what I've written ...  kept in a book shelf out of the room.\"<ref name=\"Desk\" />\n\n====Theory of novel authorship and sources of inspiration====\nRotenberg never considered writing his novels as stage- or screenplays, as he thinks of the novel as the \"mother\" of all [[genres]]: \"A novel that makes sense is somehow more satisfying to me than a three-act play, and not as contrived or as constrained as a movie script. And my primary interest as a writer is in character rather than plot.\"<ref name=\"Quill\" /> Teaching acting has been an important aspect of his writing, an \"anchor\":<blockquote>I learn a lot from talented actors every week. Their insights and dedication are extraordinary and a great many of them are avid readers, often chiding me to get on with the next book because they've waited long enough to find out what the hung boy is about or why there are so many churches along Annette Street or will Yslan and Decker ever get together.<ref name=\"Clare2\" /></blockquote> As well, Rotenberg's characters and their exceptional talents are often drawn from his students:<blockquote>When I teach acting, periodically I come across people who really do have special gifts. There are people you can see are working their butts off, but you're never sure they're going to make more than the grade ...  They are generally people who are instinctively in touch with deeper spiritual currents.<ref name=\"Quill\" /></blockquote>Finally, Rotenberg's principal career path has had a more straightforward influence on his writing:<blockquote>I've been asked for years to write a book about the unique way that I teach acting. But every time I've sat down at my computer I've wanted to write fiction, not a how-to book, so instead I've integrated my knowledge of acting teaching into my novels. Geoffrey Hyland in two of the five Shanghai mysteries has come to Shanghai to direct a production of ''Twelfth Night'' (I've directed it twice myself) and Decker Roberts, the lead in the Junction Chronicles series ... actually teaches in the acting studio that I started in Toronto\u2014Pro Actors Lab.<ref name=\"Clare2\" /></blockquote>\n\nCanadian crime stories, whodunits and thrillers have been increasing in popularlity since the turn of the 21st century, a market previously dominated by British, American, and more recently, Scandinavian novelists. David Rotenberg believes Canadians have had time to avoid mistakes other crime and mystery writers have made: \"The Brits and Scandinavians are less interested in social context than we are ... The whodunit aspect interests me less than the social and historical forces at work in a mystery story. ''Hamlet'' would be just another whodunit if you stripped it of context, and it would have nothing important to say.\"<ref name=\"Quill2\">{{cite news |last1=Quill |first1=Greg |title=Canadian crime novelists: In for the kill |url=https://www.thespec.com/whatson-story/2215762-canadian-crime-novelists-in-for-the-kill/ |accessdate=8 April 2019 |work=[[Hamilton Spectator]] |date=26 January 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nRotenberg has resided in Toronto since his return from the US in 1987, in [[The Junction]],<ref name=\"Clare1\" /> with his wife Susan Santiago,<ref name=\"Nero\" /> a [[Puerto Ricans|Puerto Rican]] [[Americans|American]].<ref name=\"Selnes\">{{cite web |last1=Selnes |first1=Bill (interviewer) |title=Questions and Answers with David Rotenberg |url=http://mysteriesandmore.blogspot.com/2012/01/questions-and-answers-with-david.html |website=Mysteries and More from Saskatchewan |accessdate=28 October 2019 |date=January 18, 2012}}</ref> They have two adult children, both [[dual citizens]],<ref name=\"Selnes\" /> Elizabeth Sara (Beth)<ref>{{cite web |title=Beth Rotenberg |url=https://gocolgateraiders.com/sports/womens-ice-hockey/roster/beth-rotenberg/2332 |website=gocolgateraiders.com |accessdate=22 November 2019}}</ref> and Joe,<ref name=\"Nero\" /> after whom he named his production company, \"Joe and Beth and She and Me Productions Ltd.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=Apply to Our Classes |url=https://www.proactorslab.com/classes/apply.html |website=proactorslab.com |accessdate=6 April 2019}}</ref> Beth was born only a few months after Rotenberg's move back to Toronto.<ref name=\"Silverstein\" /> She also writes, and her father expressed an interest in working with her on a project in the 2012 interview.<ref name=\"Open\" />\n\nOne of his three brothers, [[Robert Rotenberg]] is a criminal lawyer and former magazine editor and an author of legal thrillers.<ref name=\"Wilson\" /> Agent Michael Levine represents both authors.<ref name=\"Quill2\" />\nHis mother and father passed in 1999 and 2009, respectively.<ref name=\"Obit1\" /><ref name=\"Obit2\" />\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{div col}}\n===Novels===\n;''[[Zhong Fong (novel series)|Zhong Fong mysteries]]''\n*''The Shanghai Murders'' (1998)\n*''The Lake Ching Murders'' (2001)\n*''The Hua Shan Hospital Murders'' (2003)\n*''The Hamlet Murders'' (2004)\n*''The Golden Mountain Murders'' (2005)\n\n;''[[Shanghai (novel)|Shanghai]]'' (2008)\n\n;''[[The Junction Chronicles]]''\n*''The Placebo Effect'' (2012)\n*''A Murder of Crows'' (2013)\n*''The Glass House'' (2014)\n\n;''The Dream Chronicles''\n*Book 1 (2017)\n*Book 2 (2019)\n\n===Selected drama===\n;Original screenplays and teleplays\n*''Ambition's Debt'' (optioned by [[Shaftesbury Films]] as writer/director)<ref name=\"Intini\" /><ref name=\"Rotenberg\">{{cite web |title=DAVID ROTENBERG - Director/Writer/Acting Teacher |url=http://www.davidrotenberg.com/Resume_Rotenberg.pdf |website=davidrotenberg.com |accessdate=8 April 2019}}</ref>\n*''Gliders'' (commissioned by Sy Maloney and Associates; unproduced)<ref name=\"Rotenberg\" />\n*''YYZ'' (commissioned by Metaphore Productions; unproduced)<ref name=\"Rotenberg\" />\n*''Providence'' (commissioned by Berryman Production Group; unproduced)<ref name=\"Rotenberg\" />\n*8 episodes of ''Missing Treasures'' ([[Global Television]])<ref name=\"York\" /><ref name=\"Rotenberg\" />\n*6 episodes of ''Actor's Notes'' ([[Bravo!]])<ref name=\"Rotenberg\" />\n\n;Stage adaptations\n*''Dwarf'' \u2022 based on ''[[The Dwarf (Lagerkvist novel)|The Dwarf]]'', a novel by [[P\u00e4r Lagerkvist]], York University and Equity Showcase<ref name=\"Rotenberg\" />\n*''Lady in the Lake'' \u2022 based on ''[[The Lady in the Lake]]'' a novel by [[Raymond Chandler]],York University<ref name=\"Rotenberg\" />\n*''Lulu'' \u2022 based on a character in two plays by [[Frank Wedekind]], Equity Showcase<ref name=\"Rotenberg\" />\n*''The Great Gatsby'' (2008) \u2022 based on ''[[The Great Gatsby]]'' by [[F.

graduate students.<ref name=\"Intini\" /> He had expected also to resume his directing career in his hometown, but he got a rude awakening, recalling: \"I was effectively shunned,\" and was told to forget directing in Canada; there was no directing work, and he did not know why: \"Perhaps if I'd gone to, let's say, Czechoslovakia to work, I'd have come home hailed as a hero. But that Broadway stint seemed to rankle those who were handing out directing jobs here.\"<ref name=\"Gothe\" /><blockquote>I was a professional theatre director ... with two Broadway shows to my credit, dozens of regional theatre credits and I ran a major American regional theatre so it was a bit of shock to me when I returned to Canada, where I'd been born and raised, to find that the Canadian theatre community wanted nothing to do with me.

Acting is the second most consumed of all the arts... Yet there had been almost no serious intellectual thought given to how the form actually works. And actors had bought into the mediocrity that had been fed to them. Actors had actually agreed to call what they do a craft rather than an art. But surely an actor who plays Laertes in a production of ''Hamlet'' has way more to do with the success or failure of the evening than the third violinist has to do with the success or failure of a Beethoven symphony. Yet, you would never hear a violist refer to what they do as a craft\u2014never! So I started changing that, inventing new ways for actors to understand their art...<ref name=\"Clare2\" /></blockquote>In the parish hall basement, Rotenberg would quietly observe as his students videotaped themselves performing short scenes in pairs or on their own, gathering around a television set to watch the tape afterwards, and he would step in, offering blunt but constructive criticism of their scene, at the same time protecting their fragile egos with his humour - and his acuity as a teacher.<ref name=\"Intini\" /> One of his students, having worked with Rotenberg for six years, often travelling home from Los Angeles to take his classes, said Rotenberg is \"great at making us see our strengths and weaknesses.\"<ref name=\"Intini\" />\n\n===Author (1998- )===\nThe \"shunning\" Rotenberg felt from the Toronto theatrical community pushed him toward writing, both [[film scripts]], at least \nfive of which have been optioned by film companies,<ref name=\"York\" /> stage plays, such as his adaptation of ''[[The Great Gatsby]]'', which he directed at both York and [[Penn State University]],<ref name=\"Workaday\" /> and his highly successful [[novels]]. In his words, \"this shunning sent me to writing, so it worked out for the best.\"<ref name=\"Clare2\" /> An early example is his original screenplay ''Ambition's Debt'', which he was also minded to direct using only Canadian talent to fill the credits.<ref name=\"Intini\" />\n{{Quote box\n| quote  = It is a pleasure to read intelligent thrillers by Canadian writers.

Constantine]], and [[James Crumley]], as well as [[playwright]] [[Robert Litz]], who approached him in New York to work on a screenplay together, and a \"junior high school English teacher named Mr. Gallanders ... who encouraged me to read and write.\"<ref name=\"Open\" /> He went on to include [[Aaron Sorkin]] and [[Bob Dylan]], \"especially when he's not singing his songs.\"<ref name=\"Open\" />\n\nAs his first five novels were [[police procedurals]], he purposefully had his writing space cluttered with images and books: \"two large modern desks at right angles to each other \u2014 the whole thing dominated by a large computer monitor. It felt that the job was to produce order from the chaos \u2014 just as police officers must.\"<ref name=\"Desk\" /> For ''The Junction Chronicles'', he felt he needed a different kind of workspace for a different kind of literary work, \"spare \u2014 filled with leaps in time and space, often defying normal rules of storytelling\", pushing the boundaries: \"Here the job has to do with entering blank spaces \u2014 creating from whole cloth.\"<ref name=\"Desk\" /> It took him seven weeks and three days of \"intense looking\" to find the desk for his new office. Made from reclaimed wood, and only   a foot and a half deep and about four and half feet long, it is \"a piece of art in and of itself.\"<ref name=\"Desk\" /> The desk has no drawers or file cabinets nor in and out trays, just a small laptop. \"Even the hard copies of what I've written ...  kept in a book shelf out of the room.\"<ref name=\"Desk\" />\n\n====Theory of novel authorship and sources of inspiration====\nRotenberg never considered writing his novels as stage- or screenplays, as he thinks of the novel as the \"mother\" of all [[genres]]: \"A novel that makes sense is somehow more satisfying to me than a three-act play, and not as contrived or as constrained as a movie script. And my primary interest as a writer is in character rather than plot.\"<ref name=\"Quill\" /> Teaching acting has been an important aspect of his writing, an \"anchor\":<blockquote>I learn a lot from talented actors every week. Their insights and dedication are extraordinary and a great many of them are avid readers, often chiding me to get on with the next book because they've waited long enough to find out what the hung boy is about or why there are so many churches along Annette Street or will Yslan and Decker ever get together.<ref name=\"Clare2\" /></blockquote> As well, Rotenberg's characters and their exceptional talents are often drawn from his students:<blockquote>When I teach acting, periodically I come across people who really do have special gifts. There are people you can see are working their butts off, but you're never sure they're going to make more than the grade ...  They are generally people who are instinctively in touch with deeper spiritual currents.<ref name=\"Quill\" /></blockquote>Finally, Rotenberg's principal career path has had a more straightforward influence on his writing:<blockquote>I've been asked for years to write a book about the unique way that I teach acting. But every time I've sat down at my computer I've wanted to write fiction, not a how-to book, so instead I've integrated my knowledge of acting teaching into my novels. Geoffrey Hyland in two of the five Shanghai mysteries has come to Shanghai to direct a production of ''Twelfth Night'' (I've directed it twice myself) and Decker Roberts, the lead in the Junction Chronicles series ... actually teaches in the acting studio that I started in Toronto\u2014Pro Actors Lab.<ref name=\"Clare2\" /></blockquote>\n\nCanadian crime stories, whodunits and thrillers have been increasing in popularlity since the turn of the 21st century, a market previously dominated by British, American, and more recently, Scandinavian novelists. David Rotenberg believes Canadians have had time to avoid mistakes other crime and mystery writers have made: \"The Brits and Scandinavians are less interested in social context than we are ...

Professional genealogists may also conduct research for others, publish books on genealogical methods, teach, or produce their own databases. They may work for companies that provide software or produce materials of use to other professionals and to amateurs. Both try to understand not just where and when people lived, but also their lifestyles, biographies, and motivations. This often requires\u2014or leads to\u2014knowledge of antiquated laws, old political boundaries, migration trends, and historical socioeconomic or religious conditions.\n\nGenealogists sometimes specialize in a particular group, e.g. a [[Scottish clan]]; a particular [[surname]], such as in a [[one-name study]]; a small community, e.g. a single village or parish, such as in a [[one-place study]]; or a particular, often famous, person. [[Bloodlines of Salem]] is an example of a specialized family-history group. It welcomes members who can prove descent from a participant of the Salem Witch Trials or who simply choose to support the group.\n\nGenealogists and family historians often join [[Family history society|family history societies]], where novices can learn from more experienced researchers. Such societies generally serve a specific geographical area. Their members may also index records to make them more accessible, and engage in advocacy and other efforts to preserve public records and cemeteries. Some schools engage students in such projects as a means to reinforce lessons regarding immigration and history.<ref>{{cite news | first= | url=http://www.byubroadcasting.org/ancestors/teachersguide/ | title=Teacher's guide for PBS Ancestors series | publisher=BYU | date= | accessdate=2006-09-05 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061006122948/http://byubroadcasting.org/ancestors/teachersguide/ | archive-date=2006-10-06 | url-status=live }}</ref> Other benefits include family medical histories with families with serious medical conditions that are hereditary.\n\nThe terms \"genealogy\" and \"family history\" are often used synonymously, but some offer a slight difference in definition.

In the 1820s, he and fellow antiquarians began to produce genealogical and antiquarian tracts in earnest, slowly gaining a devoted audience among the American people. Though Farmer died in 1839, his efforts led to the creation of the [[New England Historic Genealogical Society]] (NEHGS), one of New England's oldest and most prominent organizations dedicated to the preservation of public records.<ref>Fran\u00e7ois Weil, \"John Farmer and the Making of American Genealogy,\" ''New England Quarterly'' 2007 80(3): 408\u2013434.</ref> NEHGS publishes the ''New England Historical and Genealogical Register.''\n\nThe [[Genealogical Society of Utah]], founded in 1894, later became the Family History Department of the LDS Church.

Reliable conclusions are based on the quality of sources, ideally original records, the information within those sources, ideally primary or firsthand information, and the evidence that can be drawn, directly or indirectly, from that information. In many instances, genealogists must skillfully assemble indirect or [[circumstantial evidence]] to build a case for identity and kinship. All evidence and conclusions, together with the documentation that supports them, is then assembled to create a cohesive genealogy or [[family history]].<ref>Board for Certification of Genealogists, ''The BCG Genealogical Standards Manual'' (Provo, Utah: Ancestry, 2000); National Genealogical Society, ''American Genealogy'' (Arlington, Virginia: 2005); Val D. Greenwood, ''The Researcher's Guide to American Genealogy,'' 3d ed. (Baltimore: Genealogical Publishing Co., 2000)\"</ref>\n\nGenealogists begin their research by collecting family documents and stories. This creates a foundation for [[documentary research]], which involves examining and evaluating historical records for evidence about ancestors and other relatives, their kinship ties, and the events that occurred in their lives. As a rule, genealogists begin with the present and work backward in time. Historical, social, and family context is essential to achieving correct identification of individuals and relationships. Source citation is also important when conducting genealogical research.<ref name=\"evidence\">Elizabeth Shown Mills, ''Evidence Explained: Citing History Sources from Artifacts to Cyberspace'', (Baltimore: Genealogical Publishing Co., 2007).</ref> To keep track of collected material, family group sheets and [[pedigree chart]]s are used.

Three DNA types are of particular interest: [[mitochondrial DNA]] that we all possess and that is passed down with only minor mutations through the matrilineal (direct female) line; the [[Y-chromosome]], present only in males, which is passed down with only minor mutations through the patrilineal (direct male) line; and the [[Autosomal DNA]], which is found in the 22 non-gender specific chromosomes (autosomes) inherited from both parents, which can uncover relatives from any branch of the family.  A [[genealogical DNA test]] allows two individuals to find the probability that they are, or are not, related within an estimated number of generations. Individual [[Genealogical DNA test|genetic test results]] are collected in databases to match people descended from a relatively recent common ancestor. See, for example, the [[Molecular Genealogy Research Project]]. These tests are limited to either the patrilineal or the matrilineal line.<ref>CeCe Moore, \"The History of Genetic Genealogy and Unknown Parentage Research: An Insider\u2019s View.\" ''Journal of Genetic Genealogy'' 8.1 (2016): 35-37.</ref>\n\n===Collaboration===\nMost [[genealogy software]] programs can export information about persons and their relationships in a standardized format called [[GEDCOM]].

These collaborations take numerous forms. Some projects prepare name indexes for records, such as [[probate]] cases, and publish the indexes, either online or off. These indexes can be used as [[finding aid]]s to locate original records. Other projects transcribe or abstract records. Offering record lookups for particular geographic areas is another common service.

Since genealogical records are often kept on paper and stacked in high-density storage, they are prone to fire, mold, insect damage, and eventual disintegration. Sometimes records of genealogical value are deliberately destroyed by governments or organizations because the records are considered to be unimportant or a privacy risk. Because of this, genealogists often organize efforts to preserve records that are at risk of destruction.

Traditionally, the basic information needed to ensure correct identification of each person are place names, occupations, [[family name]]s, first names, and dates. However, modern genealogists greatly expand this list, recognizing the need to place this information in its historical context in order to properly evaluate genealogical evidence and distinguish between same-name individuals. A great deal of information is available for British ancestry<ref>Mark D. Herber, ''Ancestral Trails: The Complete Guide to British Genealogy and Family History'' 2nd ed.

J. A. Guth, \"Surname Spellings and Computerised Record Linkage,\" ''Historical Methods Newsletter'', vol. 10, no. 1, pp. 10\u201319, 1976.</ref>\n\nIn many cultures, the name of a person refers to the family to which he or she belongs. This is called the ''[[family name]]'', ''surname'', or ''last name''. [[Patronymic]]s are names that identify an individual based on the father's name. For example, Marga Olafsdottir is Marga, daughter of Olaf, and Olaf Thorsson is Olaf, son of Thor. Many cultures used patronymics before surnames were adopted or came into use. The Dutch in New York, for example, used the patronymic system of names until 1687 when the advent of English rule mandated surname usage.<ref>{{cite web | author=Lorine McGinnis Schulze | title=Dutch Patronymics of the 1600s | publisher=Olive Tree Genealogy | url=http://olivetreegenealogy.com/nn/pat.shtml | accessdate=2008-01-29 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080501113910/http://www.olivetreegenealogy.com/nn/pat.shtml | archive-date=2008-05-01 | url-status=live }}</ref> In Iceland, patronymics are used by a majority of the population.<ref>Surnames made their way into the language in the 19th and 20th century, but are not widely used.

Not until 1856 in Denmark<ref>An earlier law was in effect in 1828, but was largely ignored in the rural areas.</ref> and 1923 in Norway<ref>{{cite web | author= | title=Lov av 9. februar 1923 nr. 2 om personnavn (Norwegian Name Law of 1923) | url=http://www.geocities.com/dagtho/act19230209-002.html | publisher= | language=Norwegian | accessdate=2008-01-29|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070610181013/http://www.geocities.com/dagtho/act19230209-002.html|archivedate=2007-06-10}}</ref> were there laws requiring surnames.\n\nThe transmission of names across generations, marriages and other relationships, and immigration may cause difficulty in genealogical research. For instance, women in many cultures have routinely used their spouse's surnames. When a woman remarried, she may have changed her name and the names of her children; only her name; or changed no names. Her birth name ([[maiden name]]) may be reflected in her children's middle names; her own middle name; or dropped entirely.<ref>E. A. Wrigley, ''English population history from family reconstitution, 1580\u20131837'' (1997); Catherine Quantin et al., \"Which are the best identifiers for record linkage?,\" ''Informatics for Health and Social Care'' 2004, Vol. 29, No. 3-4, Pages 221\u2013227</ref> Children may sometimes assume stepparent, foster parent, or adoptive parent names. Because official records may reflect many kinds of surname change, without explaining the underlying reason for the change, the correct identification of a person recorded identified with more than one name is challenging.  Immigrants to America often Americanized their names.<ref>Marc Picard, \"Genealogical Evidence and the Americanization of European Family Names,\" ''Names: American Name Society'' 2009 57(1): 30\u201351</ref>\n\nSurname data may be found in trade directories, census returns, birth, death, and marriage records.\n\n===Given names===\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2015}}\nGenealogical data regarding [[given name]]s (first names) is subject to many of the same problems as are family names and place names. Additionally, the use of [[nicknames]] is very common. For example, Beth, Lizzie or Betty are all common for Elizabeth, and Jack, John and Jonathan may be interchanged.\n\nMiddle names provide additional information. Middle names may be inherited, follow naming customs, or be treated as part of the family name. For instance, in some Latin cultures, both the mother's family name and the father's family name are used by the children.\n\nHistorically, naming traditions existed in some places and cultures. Even in areas that tended to use naming conventions, however, they were by no means universal. Families may have used them some of the time, among some of their children, or not at all. A pattern might also be broken to name a newborn after a recently deceased sibling, aunt or uncle.\n\nAn example of a naming tradition from England, Scotland and Ireland:\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\">\n{|width=50% |gap=4em\n| '''Child'''\n| '''Namesake'''\n|-\n| 1st son\n| paternal grandfather\n|-\n| 2nd son\n| maternal grandfather\n|-\n| 3rd son\n| father\n|-\n| 4th son\n| father's oldest brother\n|-\n| 1st daughter\n| maternal grandmother\n|-\n| 2nd daughter\n| paternal grandmother\n|-\n| 3rd daughter\n| mother\n|-\n| 4th daughter\n| mother's oldest sister\n|}\n</div>\n\nAnother example is in some areas of Germany, where siblings were given the same first name, often of a favourite saint or local nobility, but different second names by which they were known (''Rufname''). If a child died, the next child of the same gender that was born may have been given the same name. It is not uncommon that a list of a particular couple's children will show one or two names repeated.\n\nPersonal names have periods of popularity, so it is not uncommon to find many similarly named people in a generation, and even similarly named families; e.g., \"William and Mary and their children David, Mary, and John\".\n\nMany names may be identified strongly with a particular gender; e.g., William for boys, and Mary for girls. Others may be [[unisex names|ambiguous]], e.g., Lee, or have only slightly variant spellings based on gender, e.g., Frances (usually female) and Francis (usually male).\n\n===Place names===\nWhile the locations of ancestors' residences and life events are core elements of the genealogist's quest, they can often be confusing. Place names may be subject to variant spellings by partially literate scribes. Locations may have identical or very similar names. For example, the village name [[Brockton (disambiguation)|Brockton]] occurs six times in the border area between the English counties of [[Shropshire]] and [[Staffordshire]]. Shifts in political borders must also be understood. Parish, county, and national borders have frequently been modified. Old records may contain references to farms and villages that have ceased to exist. When working with older records from Poland, where borders and place names have changed frequently in past centuries, a source with maps and sample records such as ''[[A Translation Guide to 19th-Century Polish-Language Civil-Registration Documents]]'' can be invaluable.\n\nAvailable sources may include vital records (civil or church registration), censuses, and tax assessments. Oral tradition is also an important source, although it must be used with caution. When no source information is available for a location, circumstantial evidence may provide a probable answer based on a person's or a family's place of residence at the time of the event.\n\nMaps and gazetteers are important sources for understanding the places researched. They show the relationship of an area to neighboring communities and may be of help in understanding migration patterns. [[Family tree mapping]] using online mapping tools such as [[Google Earth]] (particularly when used with Historical Map overlays such as those from the [[David Rumsey Historical Map Collection]]) assist in the process of understanding the significance of geographical locations.\n\n===Dates===\nIt is wise to exercise extreme caution with dates. Dates are more difficult to recall years after an event, and are more easily mistranscribed than other types of genealogical data.<ref name=\"knights\">Peter R. Knights, \"The Accuracy of Age Reporting in the Manuscript Federal Census of 1850 and 1860,\" ''Historical Methods Newsletter,'' 4 (1971), 79\u201383; Karen Oppenheim Mason and Lisa G. Cope, \"Sources of Age and Date-of-Birth Misreporting in the 1900 U.S. Census,\" ''Demography'' vol. 24, no. 4 (Nov., 1987), pp. 563\u2013573.</ref> Therefore, one should determine whether the date was recorded at the time of the event or at a later date. Dates of birth in vital records or civil registrations and in church records at baptism are generally accurate because they were usually recorded near the time of the event. Family Bibles are often a source for dates, but can be written from memory long after the event. When the same ink and handwriting is used for all entries, the dates were probably written at the same time and therefore will be less reliable since the earlier dates were probably recorded well after the event. The publication date of the Bible also provides a clue about when the dates were recorded since they could not have been recorded at any earlier date.\n\nPeople sometimes reduce their age on marriage, and those under \"full age\" may increase their age in order to marry or to join the armed forces. [[Census]] returns are notoriously unreliable for ages or for assuming an approximate death date. Ages over 15 in the [[UK Census|1841 census in the UK]] are rounded down to the next lower multiple of five years.\n\nAlthough baptismal dates are often used to approximate birth dates, some families waited years before baptizing children, and adult baptisms are the norm in some religions. Both birth and marriage dates may have been adjusted to cover for pre-wedding pregnancies.\n\nCalendar changes must also be considered. In 1752, England and her American colonies changed from the [[Julian calendar|Julian]] to the [[Gregorian calendar]]. In the same year, the date the new year began was changed. Prior to 1752 it was [[Lady Day|25 March]]; this was changed to 1 January. Many other European countries had already made the calendar changes before England had, sometimes centuries earlier. By 1751 there was an 11-day discrepancy between the date in England and the date in other European countries.\n\nFor further detail on the changes involved in moving from the Julian to the Gregorian calendar, see: [[Gregorian calendar]].\n\nThe [[French Republican Calendar]] or French Revolutionary Calendar was a calendar proposed during the French Revolution, and used by the French government for about 12 years from late 1793 to 1805, and for 18 days in 1871 in Paris. Dates in official records at this time use the revolutionary calendar and need \"translating\" into the Gregorian calendar for calculating ages etc. There are various websites which do this.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fourmilab.ch/documents/calendar/ |title=Calendar Converter |publisher=Fourmilab.ch |date= |accessdate=2013-03-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170913160427/http://www.fourmilab.ch/documents/calendar/ |archive-date=2017-09-13 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n===Occupations===\nOccupational information may be important to understanding an ancestor's life and for distinguishing two people with the same name. A person's occupation may have been related to his or her social status, political interest, and migration pattern. Since skilled trades are often passed from father to son, occupation may also be indirect evidence of a family relationship.\n\nIt is important to remember that a person may change occupations, and that titles change over time as well. Some workers no longer fit for their primary trade often took less prestigious jobs later in life, while others moved upwards in prestige.<ref>Robert M. Hauser, [http://www.ssc.wisc.edu/wlsresearch/publications/files/public/Hauser_Occupational.Status.N.T.C.pdf \"Occupational Status in the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100621014531/http://www.ssc.wisc.edu/wlsresearch/publications/files/public/Hauser_Occupational.Status.N.T.C.pdf |date=2010-06-21 }}, ''Historical Methods'' (1982) vol. 15, no. 3, 111\u2013126.</ref> Many unskilled ancestors had a variety of jobs depending on the season and local trade requirements. Census returns may contain some embellishment; e.g., from [[labourer]] to [[masonry|mason]], or from [[journeyman]] to [[master craftsman]]. Names for old or unfamiliar local occupations may cause confusion if poorly legible. For example, an ostler (a keeper of horses) and a hostler (an innkeeper) could easily be confused for one another. Likewise, descriptions of such occupations may also be problematic. The perplexing description \"ironer of rabbit burrows\" may turn out to describe an ironer (profession) in the [[Bristol]] district named Rabbit Burrows. Several trades have regionally preferred terms. For example, \"shoemaker\" and \"cordwainer\" have the same meaning. Finally, many apparently obscure jobs are part of a larger trade community, such as watchmaking, [[Stocking frame|framework knitting]] or gunmaking.\n\nOccupational data may be reported in occupational licenses, tax assessments, membership records of professional organizations, trade directories, census returns, and vital records (civil registration). Occupational dictionaries are available to explain many obscure and archaic trades.<ref>For example, United States Bureau of Employment Security, ''The Dictionary of Occupational Titles'' (1939)</ref>\n\n==Reliability of sources==\nInformation found in historical or genealogical sources can be unreliable and it is good practice to evaluate all sources with a critical eye. Factors influencing the reliability of genealogical information include: the knowledge of the informant (or writer); the bias and mental state of the informant (or write; the passage of time and the potential for copying and compiling errors.\n\nThe quality of census data has been of special interest to historians, who have investigated reliability issues.<ref name=\"knights\"/><ref>Richard H. Steckel, \"The Quality of Census Data for Historical Inquiry: A Research Agenda,\" ''Social Science History,'' vol. 15, no. 4 (Winter, 1991), pp. 579\u2013599.</ref>\n\n===Knowledge of the informant===\nThe informant is the individual who provided the recorded information. Genealogists must carefully consider who provided the information and what he or she knew. In many cases the informant is identified in the record itself. For example, a death certificate usually has two informants: a physician who provides information about the time and cause of death and a family member who provides the birth date, names of parents, etc.\n\nWhen the informant is not identified, one can sometimes deduce information about the identity of the person by careful examination of the source. One should first consider who was alive (and nearby) when the record was created. When the informant is also the person recording the information, the handwriting can be compared to other handwriting samples.\n\nWhen a source does not provide clues about the informant, genealogists should treat the source with caution. These sources can be useful if they can be compared with independent sources. For example, a census record by itself cannot be given much weight because the informant is unknown. However, when censuses for several years concur on a piece of information that would not likely be guessed by a neighbor, it is likely that the information in these censuses was provided by a family member or other informed person. On the other hand, information in a single census cannot be confirmed by information in an undocumented compiled genealogy since the genealogy may have used the census record as its source and might therefore be dependent on the same misinformed individual.\n\n===Motivation of the informant===\nEven individuals who had knowledge of the fact, sometimes intentionally or unintentionally provided false or misleading information. A person may have lied in order to obtain a government benefit (such as a military pension), avoid taxation, or cover up an embarrassing situation (such as the existence of a non-marital child). A person with a distressed state of mind may not be able to accurately recall information. Many genealogical records were recorded at the time of a loved one's death, and so genealogists should consider the effect that grief may have had on the informant of these records.\n\n===The effect of time===\nThe passage of time often affects a person's ability to recall information. Therefore, as a general rule, data recorded soon after the event are usually more reliable than data recorded many years later. However, some types of data are more difficult to recall after many years than others. One type especially prone to recollection errors is dates. Also the ability to recall is affected by the significance that the event had to the individual. These values may have been affected by cultural or individual preferences.\n\n===Copying and compiling errors===\nGenealogists must consider the effects that copying and compiling errors may have had on the information in a source. For this reason, sources are generally categorized in two categories: original and derivative. An original source is one that is not based on another source. A derivative source is information taken from another source. This distinction is important because each time a source is copied, information about the record may be lost and errors may result from the copyist misreading, mistyping, or miswriting the information. Genealogists should consider the number of times information has been copied and the types of derivation a piece of information has undergone. The types of derivatives include: photocopies, transcriptions, abstracts, translations, extractions, and compilations.\n\nIn addition to copying errors, compiled sources (such as published genealogies and online pedigree databases) are susceptible to misidentification errors and incorrect conclusions based on circumstantial evidence. Identity errors usually occur when two or more individuals are assumed to be the same person. Circumstantial or indirect evidence does not explicitly answer a genealogical question, but either may be used with other sources to answer the question, suggest a probable answer, or eliminate certain possibilities. Compilers sometimes draw hasty conclusions from circumstantial evidence without sufficiently examining all available sources, without properly understanding the evidence, and without appropriately indicating the level of uncertainty.\n\n===Primary and secondary sources===\nIn genealogical research, information can be obtained from primary or secondary sources. Primary sources are records that were made at the time of the event, for example a death certificate would be a primary source for a person's death date and place. Secondary sources are records that are made days, weeks, months, or even years after an event.\n\n==Standards and Ethics==\n\nOrganizations that educate and certify genealogists have established standards and ethical guidelines they instruct genealogists to follow.\n\n===Research standards===\n\nGenealogy research requires analyzing documents and drawing conclusions based on the evidence provided in the available documents. Genealogists need standards to determine whether or not their evaluation of the evidence is accurate. In the past, genealogists in the [[United States]] borrowed terms from [[Burden of proof (law)|judicial law]] to examine evidence found in documents and how they relate to the researcher's conclusions. However, the differences between the two disciplines created a need for genealogists to develop their own standards. In 2000, the [[Board for Certification of Genealogists]] published their first manual of standards. The [[Genealogical Proof Standard]] created by the Board for Certification of Genealogists is widely distributed in seminars, workshops, and educational materials for genealogists in the United States. Other genealogical organizations around the world have created similar standards they invite genealogists to follow. Such standards provide guidelines for genealogists to evaluate their own research as well as the research of others.\n\nStandards for genealogical research include:<ref name=bcgstandards>{{cite web |url=https://bcgcertification.org/ethics-standards/ |title=Ethics and Standards |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website=Board for Certification of Genealogists |publisher= |access-date=23 July 2019 |quote= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190721085908/https://bcgcertification.org/ethics-standards/ |archive-date=21 July 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=sogstandards>{{cite web |url=http://www.sog.org.uk/learn/education-sub-page-for-testing-navigation/hints-tips-six-standards-and-good-practice-in-genealogy/ |title=Hints & Tips Five: Standards and Good Practice in Genealogy |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website=Society of Genealogists |publisher= |access-date=23 July 2019 |quote= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190704053351/http://www.sog.org.uk/learn/education-sub-page-for-testing-navigation/hints-tips-six-standards-and-good-practice-in-genealogy/ |archive-date=4 July 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=iajgs>{{cite web |url=http://www.iajgs.org/blog/code-of-conduct/ |title=Code of Conduct/Ethics |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website=International Association of Jewish Genealogical Societies |publisher= |access-date=23 July 2019 |quote= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190702023319/http://www.iajgs.org/blog/code-of-conduct/ |archive-date=2 July 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n* Clearly document and organize findings.\n* Cite all sources in a specific manner so that others can locate them and properly evaluate them.\n* Locate all available sources that may contain information relevant to the research question.\n* Analyze findings thoroughly, without ignoring conflicts in records or negative evidence.\n* Rely on original, rather than derivative sources, wherever possible.\n* Use logical reasoning based on reliable sources to reach conclusions.\n* Acknowledge when a specific conclusion is only \"possible\" or \"probable\" rather than \"proven.\"\n* Acknowledge that other records that have not yet been discovered may overturn a conclusion.\n\n===Ethical guidelines===\n\nGenealogists often handle sensitive information and share and publish such information. Because of this, there is a need for ethical standards and boundaries for when information is too sensitive to be published. Historically, some genealogists have fabricated information or have otherwise been untrustworthy. Genealogical organizations around the world have outlined ethical standards as an attempt to eliminate such problems. Ethical standards adopted by various genealogical organizations include:<ref>{{cite web |url=https://bcgcertification.org/ethics-standards/code/ |title=Genealogist's Code of Ethics |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website=Board for Certification of Genealogists |publisher= |access-date=23 July 2019 |quote= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190603030723/https://bcgcertification.org/ethics-standards/code/ |archive-date=3 June 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.apgen.org/ethics/ |title=Code of Ethics and Professional Practices |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website=Association of Professional Genealogists |publisher= |access-date=23 July 2019 |quote= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190704030324/https://www.apgen.org/ethics/ |archive-date=4 July 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=iajgs /><ref name=sogstandards /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://affho.org/about/ethics/ |title=Code of Ethics |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website=The Australasian Federation of Family History Organisations |publisher= |access-date=23 July 2019 |quote= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190704030325/http://affho.org/about/ethics/ |archive-date=4 July 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n* Respect copyright laws\n* Acknowledge where one consulted another's work and do not plagiarize the work of other researchers.\n* Treat original records with respect and avoid causing damage to them or removing them from repositories.\n* Treat archives and archive staff with respect.\n* Protect the privacy of living individuals by not publishing or otherwise disclosing information about them without their permission.\n* Disclose any conflicts of interest to clients.\n* When doing paid research, be clear with the client about scope of research and fees involved.\n* Do not fabricate information or publish false or unproven information as proven.\n* Be sensitive about information found through genealogical research that may make the client or family members uncomfortable.\nIn 2015, a committee presented standards for [[genetic genealogy]] at the Salt Lake Institute of Genealogy. The standards emphasize that genealogists and testing companies should respect the privacy of clients and recognize the limits of DNA tests. It also discusses how genealogists should thoroughly document conclusions made using DNA evidence.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.geneticgenealogystandards.com |title=The Genetic Genealogy Standards |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website=The Genetic Genealogy Standartds |publisher= |access-date=23 July 2019 |quote= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190724004323/https://www.geneticgenealogystandards.com/ |archive-date=24 July 2019 |url-status=live }}[/]</ref> In 2019, the Board for the Certification of Genealogists officially updated their standards and code of ethics to include standards for genetic genealogy.<ref name=bcgstandards />\n\n==See also==\n\n{{collist|colwidth=30em|\n* [[Ahnentafel]]\n* [[Cluster genealogy]]\n* [[Descent from antiquity]]\n* [[Family tree]]\n* [[Genealogical DNA test]]\n* [[Genealogical numbering systems]]\n* [[International Museum for Family History]]\n* [[Genealogy software]]\n* [[Genealogy tourism]]\n* [[List of genealogy databases]]\n* [[List of Mormon family organizations]]\n* [[Forensic genealogy]]\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{refbegin}}\n'''General'''\n* {{cite book |last=Christian |first=Peter |title=The Genealogist's Internet |edition=5th |location=London, England |publisher=Bloomsbury |date=2012 |isbn=978-1-4081-5957-6 }}\n* Hopwood, Nick, Rebecca Flemming, Lauren Kassell, eds.

Professional genealogists may also conduct research for others, publish books on genealogical methods, teach, or produce their own databases. They may work for companies that provide software or produce materials of use to other professionals and to amateurs. Both try to understand not just where and when people lived, but also their lifestyles, biographies, and motivations. This often requires\u2014or leads to\u2014knowledge of antiquated laws, old political boundaries, migration trends, and historical socioeconomic or religious conditions.\n\nGenealogists sometimes specialize in a particular group, e.g. a [[Scottish clan]]; a particular [[surname]], such as in a [[one-name study]]; a small community, e.g. a single village or parish, such as in a [[one-place study]]; or a particular, often famous, person. [[Bloodlines of Salem]] is an example of a specialized family-history group. It welcomes members who can prove descent from a participant of the Salem Witch Trials or who simply choose to support the group.\n\nGenealogists and family historians often join [[Family history society|family history societies]], where novices can learn from more experienced researchers. Such societies generally serve a specific geographical area. Their members may also index records to make them more accessible, and engage in advocacy and other efforts to preserve public records and cemeteries.

Reliable conclusions are based on the quality of sources, ideally original records, the information within those sources, ideally primary or firsthand information, and the evidence that can be drawn, directly or indirectly, from that information. In many instances, genealogists must skillfully assemble indirect or [[circumstantial evidence]] to build a case for identity and kinship. All evidence and conclusions, together with the documentation that supports them, is then assembled to create a cohesive genealogy or [[family history]].<ref>Board for Certification of Genealogists, ''The BCG Genealogical Standards Manual'' (Provo, Utah: Ancestry, 2000); National Genealogical Society, ''American Genealogy'' (Arlington, Virginia: 2005); Val D. Greenwood, ''The Researcher's Guide to American Genealogy,'' 3d ed. (Baltimore: Genealogical Publishing Co., 2000)\"</ref>\n\nGenealogists begin their research by collecting family documents and stories. This creates a foundation for [[documentary research]], which involves examining and evaluating historical records for evidence about ancestors and other relatives, their kinship ties, and the events that occurred in their lives. As a rule, genealogists begin with the present and work backward in time. Historical, social, and family context is essential to achieving correct identification of individuals and relationships. Source citation is also important when conducting genealogical research.<ref name=\"evidence\">Elizabeth Shown Mills, ''Evidence Explained: Citing History Sources from Artifacts to Cyberspace'', (Baltimore: Genealogical Publishing Co., 2007).</ref> To keep track of collected material, family group sheets and [[pedigree chart]]s are used.

Three DNA types are of particular interest: [[mitochondrial DNA]] that we all possess and that is passed down with only minor mutations through the matrilineal (direct female) line; the [[Y-chromosome]], present only in males, which is passed down with only minor mutations through the patrilineal (direct male) line; and the [[Autosomal DNA]], which is found in the 22 non-gender specific chromosomes (autosomes) inherited from both parents, which can uncover relatives from any branch of the family.  A [[genealogical DNA test]] allows two individuals to find the probability that they are, or are not, related within an estimated number of generations. Individual [[Genealogical DNA test|genetic test results]] are collected in databases to match people descended from a relatively recent common ancestor. See, for example, the [[Molecular Genealogy Research Project]]. These tests are limited to either the patrilineal or the matrilineal line.<ref>CeCe Moore, \"The History of Genetic Genealogy and Unknown Parentage Research: An Insider\u2019s View.\" ''Journal of Genetic Genealogy'' 8.1 (2016): 35-37.</ref>\n\n===Collaboration===\nMost [[genealogy software]] programs can export information about persons and their relationships in a standardized format called [[GEDCOM]].

[[Social networking service]] (SNS) websites allow genealogists to share data and build their family trees online. Members can upload their family trees and contact other family historians to fill in gaps in their research.

These collaborations take numerous forms. Some projects prepare name indexes for records, such as [[probate]] cases, and publish the indexes, either online or off. These indexes can be used as [[finding aid]]s to locate original records. Other projects transcribe or abstract records. Offering record lookups for particular geographic areas is another common service.

Traditionally, the basic information needed to ensure correct identification of each person are place names, occupations, [[family name]]s, first names, and dates. However, modern genealogists greatly expand this list, recognizing the need to place this information in its historical context in order to properly evaluate genealogical evidence and distinguish between same-name individuals. A great deal of information is available for British ancestry<ref>Mark D. Herber, ''Ancestral Trails: The Complete Guide to British Genealogy and Family History'' 2nd ed.

J. A. Guth, \"Surname Spellings and Computerised Record Linkage,\" ''Historical Methods Newsletter'', vol. 10, no. 1, pp. 10\u201319, 1976.</ref>\n\nIn many cultures, the name of a person refers to the family to which he or she belongs. This is called the ''[[family name]]'', ''surname'', or ''last name''. [[Patronymic]]s are names that identify an individual based on the father's name. For example, Marga Olafsdottir is Marga, daughter of Olaf, and Olaf Thorsson is Olaf, son of Thor. Many cultures used patronymics before surnames were adopted or came into use. The Dutch in New York, for example, used the patronymic system of names until 1687 when the advent of English rule mandated surname usage.<ref>{{cite web | author=Lorine McGinnis Schulze | title=Dutch Patronymics of the 1600s | publisher=Olive Tree Genealogy | url=http://olivetreegenealogy.com/nn/pat.shtml | accessdate=2008-01-29 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080501113910/http://www.olivetreegenealogy.com/nn/pat.shtml | archive-date=2008-05-01 | url-status=live }}</ref> In Iceland, patronymics are used by a majority of the population.<ref>Surnames made their way into the language in the 19th and 20th century, but are not widely used. In order to protect the patronymics system, in Iceland it is forbidden by law to introduce a new surname.{{cite web | title=L\u00f6g um Mannan\u00f6fn | url=http://www.althingi.is/lagasofn/nuna/1996045.html | language=Icelandic | accessdate=2008-01-29 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090126040640/http://www.althingi.is/lagasofn/nuna/1996045.html | archive-date=2009-01-26 | url-status=live }}</ref> In Denmark and Norway patronymics and farm names were generally in use through the 19th century and beyond, though surnames began to come into fashion toward the end of the 19th century in some parts of the country. Not until 1856 in Denmark<ref>An earlier law was in effect in 1828, but was largely ignored in the rural areas.</ref> and 1923 in Norway<ref>{{cite web | author= | title=Lov av 9. februar 1923 nr. 2 om personnavn (Norwegian Name Law of 1923) | url=http://www.geocities.com/dagtho/act19230209-002.html | publisher= | language=Norwegian | accessdate=2008-01-29|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070610181013/http://www.geocities.com/dagtho/act19230209-002.html|archivedate=2007-06-10}}</ref> were there laws requiring surnames.\n\nThe transmission of names across generations, marriages and other relationships, and immigration may cause difficulty in genealogical research. For instance, women in many cultures have routinely used their spouse's surnames. When a woman remarried, she may have changed her name and the names of her children; only her name; or changed no names. Her birth name ([[maiden name]]) may be reflected in her children's middle names; her own middle name; or dropped entirely.<ref>E. A. Wrigley, ''English population history from family reconstitution, 1580\u20131837'' (1997); Catherine Quantin et al., \"Which are the best identifiers for record linkage?,\" ''Informatics for Health and Social Care'' 2004, Vol. 29, No. 3-4, Pages 221\u2013227</ref> Children may sometimes assume stepparent, foster parent, or adoptive parent names. Because official records may reflect many kinds of surname change, without explaining the underlying reason for the change, the correct identification of a person recorded identified with more than one name is challenging.  Immigrants to America often Americanized their names.<ref>Marc Picard, \"Genealogical Evidence and the Americanization of European Family Names,\" ''Names: American Name Society'' 2009 57(1): 30\u201351</ref>\n\nSurname data may be found in trade directories, census returns, birth, death, and marriage records.\n\n===Given names===\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2015}}\nGenealogical data regarding [[given name]]s (first names) is subject to many of the same problems as are family names and place names. Additionally, the use of [[nicknames]] is very common. For example, Beth, Lizzie or Betty are all common for Elizabeth, and Jack, John and Jonathan may be interchanged.\n\nMiddle names provide additional information. Middle names may be inherited, follow naming customs, or be treated as part of the family name. For instance, in some Latin cultures, both the mother's family name and the father's family name are used by the children.\n\nHistorically, naming traditions existed in some places and cultures. Even in areas that tended to use naming conventions, however, they were by no means universal. Families may have used them some of the time, among some of their children, or not at all. A pattern might also be broken to name a newborn after a recently deceased sibling, aunt or uncle.\n\nAn example of a naming tradition from England, Scotland and Ireland:\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\">\n{|width=50% |gap=4em\n| '''Child'''\n| '''Namesake'''\n|-\n| 1st son\n| paternal grandfather\n|-\n| 2nd son\n| maternal grandfather\n|-\n| 3rd son\n| father\n|-\n| 4th son\n| father's oldest brother\n|-\n| 1st daughter\n| maternal grandmother\n|-\n| 2nd daughter\n| paternal grandmother\n|-\n| 3rd daughter\n| mother\n|-\n| 4th daughter\n| mother's oldest sister\n|}\n</div>\n\nAnother example is in some areas of Germany, where siblings were given the same first name, often of a favourite saint or local nobility, but different second names by which they were known (''Rufname''). If a child died, the next child of the same gender that was born may have been given the same name. It is not uncommon that a list of a particular couple's children will show one or two names repeated.\n\nPersonal names have periods of popularity, so it is not uncommon to find many similarly named people in a generation, and even similarly named families; e.g., \"William and Mary and their children David, Mary, and John\".\n\nMany names may be identified strongly with a particular gender; e.g., William for boys, and Mary for girls. Others may be [[unisex names|ambiguous]], e.g., Lee, or have only slightly variant spellings based on gender, e.g., Frances (usually female) and Francis (usually male).\n\n===Place names===\nWhile the locations of ancestors' residences and life events are core elements of the genealogist's quest, they can often be confusing. Place names may be subject to variant spellings by partially literate scribes. Locations may have identical or very similar names. For example, the village name [[Brockton (disambiguation)|Brockton]] occurs six times in the border area between the English counties of [[Shropshire]] and [[Staffordshire]]. Shifts in political borders must also be understood. Parish, county, and national borders have frequently been modified. Old records may contain references to farms and villages that have ceased to exist. When working with older records from Poland, where borders and place names have changed frequently in past centuries, a source with maps and sample records such as ''[[A Translation Guide to 19th-Century Polish-Language Civil-Registration Documents]]'' can be invaluable.\n\nAvailable sources may include vital records (civil or church registration), censuses, and tax assessments. Oral tradition is also an important source, although it must be used with caution. When no source information is available for a location, circumstantial evidence may provide a probable answer based on a person's or a family's place of residence at the time of the event.\n\nMaps and gazetteers are important sources for understanding the places researched. They show the relationship of an area to neighboring communities and may be of help in understanding migration patterns. [[Family tree mapping]] using online mapping tools such as [[Google Earth]] (particularly when used with Historical Map overlays such as those from the [[David Rumsey Historical Map Collection]]) assist in the process of understanding the significance of geographical locations.\n\n===Dates===\nIt is wise to exercise extreme caution with dates. Dates are more difficult to recall years after an event, and are more easily mistranscribed than other types of genealogical data.<ref name=\"knights\">Peter R. Knights, \"The Accuracy of Age Reporting in the Manuscript Federal Census of 1850 and 1860,\" ''Historical Methods Newsletter,'' 4 (1971), 79\u201383; Karen Oppenheim Mason and Lisa G. Cope, \"Sources of Age and Date-of-Birth Misreporting in the 1900 U.S. Census,\" ''Demography'' vol. 24, no. 4 (Nov., 1987), pp. 563\u2013573.</ref> Therefore, one should determine whether the date was recorded at the time of the event or at a later date. Dates of birth in vital records or civil registrations and in church records at baptism are generally accurate because they were usually recorded near the time of the event. Family Bibles are often a source for dates, but can be written from memory long after the event. When the same ink and handwriting is used for all entries, the dates were probably written at the same time and therefore will be less reliable since the earlier dates were probably recorded well after the event. The publication date of the Bible also provides a clue about when the dates were recorded since they could not have been recorded at any earlier date.\n\nPeople sometimes reduce their age on marriage, and those under \"full age\" may increase their age in order to marry or to join the armed forces. [[Census]] returns are notoriously unreliable for ages or for assuming an approximate death date. Ages over 15 in the [[UK Census|1841 census in the UK]] are rounded down to the next lower multiple of five years.\n\nAlthough baptismal dates are often used to approximate birth dates, some families waited years before baptizing children, and adult baptisms are the norm in some religions. Both birth and marriage dates may have been adjusted to cover for pre-wedding pregnancies.\n\nCalendar changes must also be considered. In 1752, England and her American colonies changed from the [[Julian calendar|Julian]] to the [[Gregorian calendar]]. In the same year, the date the new year began was changed. Prior to 1752 it was [[Lady Day|25 March]]; this was changed to 1 January. Many other European countries had already made the calendar changes before England had, sometimes centuries earlier. By 1751 there was an 11-day discrepancy between the date in England and the date in other European countries.\n\nFor further detail on the changes involved in moving from the Julian to the Gregorian calendar, see: [[Gregorian calendar]].\n\nThe [[French Republican Calendar]] or French Revolutionary Calendar was a calendar proposed during the French Revolution, and used by the French government for about 12 years from late 1793 to 1805, and for 18 days in 1871 in Paris. Dates in official records at this time use the revolutionary calendar and need \"translating\" into the Gregorian calendar for calculating ages etc. There are various websites which do this.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fourmilab.ch/documents/calendar/ |title=Calendar Converter |publisher=Fourmilab.ch |date= |accessdate=2013-03-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170913160427/http://www.fourmilab.ch/documents/calendar/ |archive-date=2017-09-13 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n===Occupations===\nOccupational information may be important to understanding an ancestor's life and for distinguishing two people with the same name. A person's occupation may have been related to his or her social status, political interest, and migration pattern. Since skilled trades are often passed from father to son, occupation may also be indirect evidence of a family relationship.\n\nIt is important to remember that a person may change occupations, and that titles change over time as well. Some workers no longer fit for their primary trade often took less prestigious jobs later in life, while others moved upwards in prestige.<ref>Robert M. Hauser, [http://www.ssc.wisc.edu/wlsresearch/publications/files/public/Hauser_Occupational.Status.N.T.C.pdf \"Occupational Status in the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100621014531/http://www.ssc.wisc.edu/wlsresearch/publications/files/public/Hauser_Occupational.Status.N.T.C.pdf |date=2010-06-21 }}, ''Historical Methods'' (1982) vol. 15, no. 3, 111\u2013126.</ref> Many unskilled ancestors had a variety of jobs depending on the season and local trade requirements. Census returns may contain some embellishment; e.g., from [[labourer]] to [[masonry|mason]], or from [[journeyman]] to [[master craftsman]]. Names for old or unfamiliar local occupations may cause confusion if poorly legible. For example, an ostler (a keeper of horses) and a hostler (an innkeeper) could easily be confused for one another. Likewise, descriptions of such occupations may also be problematic. The perplexing description \"ironer of rabbit burrows\" may turn out to describe an ironer (profession) in the [[Bristol]] district named Rabbit Burrows. Several trades have regionally preferred terms. For example, \"shoemaker\" and \"cordwainer\" have the same meaning. Finally, many apparently obscure jobs are part of a larger trade community, such as watchmaking, [[Stocking frame|framework knitting]] or gunmaking.\n\nOccupational data may be reported in occupational licenses, tax assessments, membership records of professional organizations, trade directories, census returns, and vital records (civil registration). Occupational dictionaries are available to explain many obscure and archaic trades.<ref>For example, United States Bureau of Employment Security, ''The Dictionary of Occupational Titles'' (1939)</ref>\n\n==Reliability of sources==\nInformation found in historical or genealogical sources can be unreliable and it is good practice to evaluate all sources with a critical eye. Factors influencing the reliability of genealogical information include: the knowledge of the informant (or writer); the bias and mental state of the informant (or write; the passage of time and the potential for copying and compiling errors.\n\nThe quality of census data has been of special interest to historians, who have investigated reliability issues.<ref name=\"knights\"/><ref>Richard H. Steckel, \"The Quality of Census Data for Historical Inquiry: A Research Agenda,\" ''Social Science History,'' vol. 15, no. 4 (Winter, 1991), pp. 579\u2013599.</ref>\n\n===Knowledge of the informant===\nThe informant is the individual who provided the recorded information. Genealogists must carefully consider who provided the information and what he or she knew. In many cases the informant is identified in the record itself. For example, a death certificate usually has two informants: a physician who provides information about the time and cause of death and a family member who provides the birth date, names of parents, etc.\n\nWhen the informant is not identified, one can sometimes deduce information about the identity of the person by careful examination of the source. One should first consider who was alive (and nearby) when the record was created. When the informant is also the person recording the information, the handwriting can be compared to other handwriting samples.\n\nWhen a source does not provide clues about the informant, genealogists should treat the source with caution. These sources can be useful if they can be compared with independent sources. For example, a census record by itself cannot be given much weight because the informant is unknown. However, when censuses for several years concur on a piece of information that would not likely be guessed by a neighbor, it is likely that the information in these censuses was provided by a family member or other informed person. On the other hand, information in a single census cannot be confirmed by information in an undocumented compiled genealogy since the genealogy may have used the census record as its source and might therefore be dependent on the same misinformed individual.\n\n===Motivation of the informant===\nEven individuals who had knowledge of the fact, sometimes intentionally or unintentionally provided false or misleading information. A person may have lied in order to obtain a government benefit (such as a military pension), avoid taxation, or cover up an embarrassing situation (such as the existence of a non-marital child). A person with a distressed state of mind may not be able to accurately recall information. Many genealogical records were recorded at the time of a loved one's death, and so genealogists should consider the effect that grief may have had on the informant of these records.\n\n===The effect of time===\nThe passage of time often affects a person's ability to recall information. Therefore, as a general rule, data recorded soon after the event are usually more reliable than data recorded many years later. However, some types of data are more difficult to recall after many years than others. One type especially prone to recollection errors is dates. Also the ability to recall is affected by the significance that the event had to the individual. These values may have been affected by cultural or individual preferences.\n\n===Copying and compiling errors===\nGenealogists must consider the effects that copying and compiling errors may have had on the information in a source. For this reason, sources are generally categorized in two categories: original and derivative. An original source is one that is not based on another source. A derivative source is information taken from another source. This distinction is important because each time a source is copied, information about the record may be lost and errors may result from the copyist misreading, mistyping, or miswriting the information. Genealogists should consider the number of times information has been copied and the types of derivation a piece of information has undergone. The types of derivatives include: photocopies, transcriptions, abstracts, translations, extractions, and compilations.\n\nIn addition to copying errors, compiled sources (such as published genealogies and online pedigree databases) are susceptible to misidentification errors and incorrect conclusions based on circumstantial evidence. Identity errors usually occur when two or more individuals are assumed to be the same person. Circumstantial or indirect evidence does not explicitly answer a genealogical question, but either may be used with other sources to answer the question, suggest a probable answer, or eliminate certain possibilities. Compilers sometimes draw hasty conclusions from circumstantial evidence without sufficiently examining all available sources, without properly understanding the evidence, and without appropriately indicating the level of uncertainty.\n\n===Primary and secondary sources===\nIn genealogical research, information can be obtained from primary or secondary sources. Primary sources are records that were made at the time of the event, for example a death certificate would be a primary source for a person's death date and place. Secondary sources are records that are made days, weeks, months, or even years after an event.\n\n==Standards and Ethics==\n\nOrganizations that educate and certify genealogists have established standards and ethical guidelines they instruct genealogists to follow.\n\n===Research standards===\n\nGenealogy research requires analyzing documents and drawing conclusions based on the evidence provided in the available documents. Genealogists need standards to determine whether or not their evaluation of the evidence is accurate. In the past, genealogists in the [[United States]] borrowed terms from [[Burden of proof (law)|judicial law]] to examine evidence found in documents and how they relate to the researcher's conclusions. However, the differences between the two disciplines created a need for genealogists to develop their own standards. In 2000, the [[Board for Certification of Genealogists]] published their first manual of standards. The [[Genealogical Proof Standard]] created by the Board for Certification of Genealogists is widely distributed in seminars, workshops, and educational materials for genealogists in the United States. Other genealogical organizations around the world have created similar standards they invite genealogists to follow. Such standards provide guidelines for genealogists to evaluate their own research as well as the research of others.\n\nStandards for genealogical research include:<ref name=bcgstandards>{{cite web |url=https://bcgcertification.org/ethics-standards/ |title=Ethics and Standards |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website=Board for Certification of Genealogists |publisher= |access-date=23 July 2019 |quote= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190721085908/https://bcgcertification.org/ethics-standards/ |archive-date=21 July 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=sogstandards>{{cite web |url=http://www.sog.org.uk/learn/education-sub-page-for-testing-navigation/hints-tips-six-standards-and-good-practice-in-genealogy/ |title=Hints & Tips Five: Standards and Good Practice in Genealogy |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website=Society of Genealogists |publisher= |access-date=23 July 2019 |quote= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190704053351/http://www.sog.org.uk/learn/education-sub-page-for-testing-navigation/hints-tips-six-standards-and-good-practice-in-genealogy/ |archive-date=4 July 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=iajgs>{{cite web |url=http://www.iajgs.org/blog/code-of-conduct/ |title=Code of Conduct/Ethics |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website=International Association of Jewish Genealogical Societies |publisher= |access-date=23 July 2019 |quote= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190702023319/http://www.iajgs.org/blog/code-of-conduct/ |archive-date=2 July 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n* Clearly document and organize findings.\n* Cite all sources in a specific manner so that others can locate them and properly evaluate them.\n* Locate all available sources that may contain information relevant to the research question.\n* Analyze findings thoroughly, without ignoring conflicts in records or negative evidence.\n* Rely on original, rather than derivative sources, wherever possible.\n* Use logical reasoning based on reliable sources to reach conclusions.\n* Acknowledge when a specific conclusion is only \"possible\" or \"probable\" rather than \"proven.\"\n* Acknowledge that other records that have not yet been discovered may overturn a conclusion.\n\n===Ethical guidelines===\n\nGenealogists often handle sensitive information and share and publish such information. Because of this, there is a need for ethical standards and boundaries for when information is too sensitive to be published. Historically, some genealogists have fabricated information or have otherwise been untrustworthy. Genealogical organizations around the world have outlined ethical standards as an attempt to eliminate such problems.

{"title_page": "How to Read a Book", "text_new": "{{more citations needed|date=January 2019}}\n{{Italic title}}\n[[File:HowToReadABook.jpg|thumb|First edition (publ. [[Simon & Schuster]])]]\n'''''How to Read a Book''''' is a 1940 book by the philosopher [[Mortimer J. Adler]]. He co-authored a heavily revised edition in 1972 with the editor [[Charles Van Doren]], which gives guidelines for critically reading good and great books of any tradition. The 1972 revision, in addition to the first edition, treats genres ([[poetry]], [[history]], [[science]], [[fiction]], et cetera), inspectional and [[wikt:syntopical|syntopical]] reading.\n\n==Overview of the 1972 edition==\n''How to Read a Book'' is divided into four parts, each consisting of several chapters.\n\n===Part I: The Dimensions of Reading===\nAdler explains for whom the book is intended, defines different classes of reading, and tells which classes will be addressed. He also makes a brief argument favoring the [[Great Books]], and explains his reasons for writing ''How to Read a Book''.\n\nThere are three types of knowledge: practical, informational, and comprehensive. He discusses the methods of acquiring knowledge, concluding that practical knowledge, though teachable, cannot be truly mastered without experience; that only informational knowledge can be gained by one whose understanding equals the author's; that comprehension (insight) is best learned from who first achieved said understanding \u2014 an \"original communication\".\n\nThe idea that communication directly from those who first discovered an idea is the best way of gaining understanding is Adler's argument for reading the Great Books; that any book that does not represent original communication is inferior, as a source, to the original, and that any teacher, save those who discovered the subject he or she teaches, is inferior to the Great Books as a source of comprehension.\n\nAdler spends a good deal of this first section explaining why he was compelled to write this book. He asserts that very few people can read a book for understanding, but that he believes that most are capable of it, given the right instruction and the will to do so. It is his intent to provide that instruction. He takes time to tell the reader about how he believes that the educational system has failed to teach students the art of reading well, up to and including undergraduate, university-level institutions. He concludes that, due to these shortcomings in formal education, it falls upon individuals to cultivate these abilities in themselves. Throughout this section, he relates anecdotes and summaries of his experience in education as support for these assertions.\n\n===Part II: The Third Level of Reading: Analytical Reading===\nHere, Adler sets forth his method for reading a non-fiction book in order to gain understanding. He claims that three distinct approaches, or readings, must all be made in order to get the most possible out of a book, but that performing these three levels of readings does not necessarily mean reading the book three times, as the experienced reader will be able to do all three in the course of reading the book just once. Adler names the readings \"structural\", \"interpretative\", and \"critical\", in that order.\n\n'''Structural Stage:''' The first stage of analytical reading is concerned with understanding the structure and purpose of the book. It begins with determining the basic topic and type of the book being read, so as to better anticipate the contents and comprehend the book from the very beginning. Adler says that the reader must distinguish between practical and theoretical books, as well as determining the field of study that the book addresses. Further, Adler says that the reader must note any divisions in the book, and that these are not restricted to the divisions laid out in the table of contents. Lastly, the reader must find out what problems the author is trying to solve.\n\n'''Interpretive Stage:''' The second stage of analytical reading involves constructing the author's arguments. This first requires the reader to note and understand any special phrases and terms that the author uses. Once that is done, Adler says that the reader should find and work to understand each proposition that the author advances, as well as the author's support for those propositions.\n\n'''Critical Stage:''' In the third stage of analytical reading, Adler directs the reader to critique the book. He asserts that upon understanding the author's propositions and arguments, the reader has been elevated to the author's level of understanding and is now able (and obligated) to judge the book's merit and accuracy. Adler advocates judging books based on the soundness of their arguments. Adler says that one may not [[intellectual honesty|disagree]] with an argument unless one can find fault in its reasoning, facts, or premises, though one is free to dislike it in any case.\n\nThe method presented is sometimes called the ''Structure-Proposition-Evaluation (SPE)'' method, though this term is not used in the book.\n\n===Part III: Approaches to Different Kinds of Reading Matter===\nIn Part III, Adler briefly discusses the differences in approaching various kinds of literature and suggests reading several other books. He explains a method of approaching the Great Books \u2013 read the books that influenced a given author prior to reading works by that author \u2013 and gives several examples of that method.\n\n===Part IV: The Ultimate Goals of Reading===\nThe last part of the book covers the fourth level of reading: syntopical reading. At this stage, the reader broadens and deepens his or her knowledge on a given subject\u2014e.g., love, war, particle physics, etc.\u2014by reading several books on that subject. In the final pages of this part, the author expounds on the philosophical benefits of reading: \"growth of the mind\", fuller experience as a conscious being.\n\n==Reading list (1972 edition)==\nAppendix A in the 1972 edition provided the following recommended reading list:\n# [[Homer]] \u2013 ''[[Iliad]]'', ''[[Odyssey]]''\n# The [[Old Testament]]\n# [[Aeschylus]] \u2013 Tragedies\n# [[Sophocles]] \u2013 Tragedies\n# [[Herodotus]] \u2013 ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories]]''\n# [[Euripides]] \u2013 Tragedies\n# [[Thucydides]] \u2013 ''[[History of the Peloponnesian War]]''\n# [[Hippocrates]] \u2013 Medical Writings\n# [[Aristophanes]] \u2013 Comedies\n# [[Plato]] \u2013 Dialogues\n# [[Aristotle]] \u2013 Works\n# [[Epicurus]] \u2013 ''Letter to Herodotus'';

[[Simon & Schuster]])]]\n'''''How to Read a Book''''' is a 1940 book by the philosopher [[Mortimer J. Adler]]. He co-authored a heavily revised edition in 1972 with the editor [[Charles Van Doren]], which gives guidelines for critically reading good and great books of any tradition. The 1972 revision, in addition to the first edition, treats genres ([[poetry]], [[history]], [[science]], [[fiction]], et cetera), inspectional and [[wikt:syntopical|syntopical]] reading.\n\n==Overview of the 1972 edition==\n''How to Read a Book'' is divided into four parts, each consisting of several chapters.\n\n===Part I: The Dimensions of Reading===\nAdler explains for whom the book is intended, defines different classes of reading, and tells which classes will be addressed. He also makes a brief argument favoring the [[Great Books]], and explains his reasons for writing ''How to Read a Book''.\n\nThere are three types of knowledge: practical, informational, and comprehensive. He discusses the methods of acquiring knowledge, concluding that practical knowledge, though teachable, cannot be truly mastered without experience; that only informational knowledge can be gained by one whose understanding equals the author's; that comprehension (insight) is best learned from who first achieved said understanding \u2014 an \"original communication\".\n\nThe idea that communication directly from those who first discovered an idea is the best way of gaining understanding is Adler's argument for reading the Great Books; that any book that does not represent original communication is inferior, as a source, to the original, and that any teacher, save those who discovered the subject he or she teaches, is inferior to the Great Books as a source of comprehension.\n\nAdler spends a good deal of this first section explaining why he was compelled to write this book. He asserts that very few people can read a book for understanding, but that he believes that most are capable of it, given the right instruction and the will to do so. It is his intent to provide that instruction. He takes time to tell the reader about how he believes that the educational system has failed to teach students the art of reading well, up to and including undergraduate, university-level institutions. He concludes that, due to these shortcomings in formal education, it falls upon individuals to cultivate these abilities in themselves. Throughout this section, he relates anecdotes and summaries of his experience in education as support for these assertions.\n\n===Part II: The Third Level of Reading: Analytical Reading===\nHere, Adler sets forth his method for reading a non-fiction book in order to gain understanding. He claims that three distinct approaches, or readings, must all be made in order to get the most possible out of a book, but that performing these three levels of readings does not necessarily mean reading the book three times, as the experienced reader will be able to do all three in the course of reading the book just once. Adler names the readings \"structural\", \"interpretative\", and \"critical\", in that order.\n\n'''Structural Stage:''' The first stage of analytical reading is concerned with understanding the structure and purpose of the book. It begins with determining the basic topic and type of the book being read, so as to better anticipate the contents and comprehend the book from the very beginning. Adler says that the reader must distinguish between practical and theoretical books, as well as determining the field of study that the book addresses. Further, Adler says that the reader must note any divisions in the book, and that these are not restricted to the divisions laid out in the table of contents. Lastly, the reader must find out what problems the author is trying to solve.\n\n'''Interpretive Stage:''' The second stage of analytical reading involves constructing the author's arguments. This first requires the reader to note and understand any special phrases and terms that the author uses. Once that is done, Adler says that the reader should find and work to understand each proposition that the author advances, as well as the author's support for those propositions.\n\n'''Critical Stage:''' In the third stage of analytical reading, Adler directs the reader to critique the book. He asserts that upon understanding the author's propositions and arguments, the reader has been elevated to the author's level of understanding and is now able (and obligated) to judge the book's merit and accuracy. Adler advocates judging books based on the soundness of their arguments. Adler says that one may not [[intellectual honesty|disagree]] with an argument unless one can find fault in its reasoning, facts, or premises, though one is free to dislike it in any case.\n\nThe method presented is sometimes called the ''Structure-Proposition-Evaluation (SPE)'' method, though this term is not used in the book.\n\n===Part III: Approaches to Different Kinds of Reading Matter===\nIn Part III, Adler briefly discusses the differences in approaching various kinds of literature and suggests reading several other books. He explains a method of approaching the Great Books \u2013 read the books that influenced a given author prior to reading works by that author \u2013 and gives several examples of that method.\n\n===Part IV: The Ultimate Goals of Reading===\nThe last part of the book covers the fourth level of reading: syntopical reading. At this stage, the reader broadens and deepens his or her knowledge on a given subject\u2014e.g., love, war, particle physics, etc.\u2014by reading several books on that subject. In the final pages of this part, the author expounds on the philosophical benefits of reading: \"growth of the mind\", fuller experience as a conscious being.\n\n==Reading list (1972 edition)==\nAppendix A in the 1972 edition provided the following recommended reading list:\n# [[Homer]] \u2013 ''[[Iliad]]'', ''[[Odyssey]]''\n# The [[Old Testament]]\n# [[Aeschylus]] \u2013 Tragedies\n# [[Sophocles]] \u2013 Tragedies\n# [[Herodotus]] \u2013 ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories]]''\n# [[Euripides]] \u2013 Tragedies\n# [[Thucydides]] \u2013 ''[[History of the Peloponnesian War]]''\n# [[Hippocrates]] \u2013 Medical Writings\n# [[Aristophanes]] \u2013 Comedies\n# [[Plato]] \u2013 Dialogues\n# [[Aristotle]] \u2013 Works\n# [[Epicurus]] \u2013 ''Letter to Herodotus'';

The book shaped popular thinking about appeasement for twenty years; it effectively destroyed the reputation of former Prime Ministers [[Stanley Baldwin]] and [[Neville Chamberlain]], and contributed to the defeat of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] at the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|1945 general election]].

They believed that Britain had suffered a succession of bad leaders who, with junior ministers, advisers and officials, had conducted a disastrous foreign policy toward Germany and had failed to prepare the country for war. After [[Victor Gollancz]], creator of the [[Left Book Club]], had been persuaded to publish the book, the authors divided the 24 chapters among themselves and wrote it in four days, finishing on 5 June 1940. Gollancz asked for some of the rhetoric to be toned down, fearing the reaction it might provoke, but he rushed it into print in four weeks.\n\nIt was under a pseudonym because the writers were employed by [[William Maxwell Aitken, 1st Baron Beaverbrook|Lord Beaverbrook]], who barred his journalists from writing for publications other than his own. Beaverbrook, who was active in the Conservative Party, was also a vocal supporter of appeasement, though he was not mentioned in the book.<ref>Michael Foot, Preface to the 1998 re-issue of ''Guilty Men'', Penguin Books</ref>\n\nThere was much speculation as to who Cato was. At one time [[Aneurin Bevan]] was named as its author. In the meantime, the real authors had some fun reviewing their own work. Michael Foot wrote an article, \"Who is This Cato?\" Beaverbrook was as much in the dark as anyone but joked that he \"made do with the royalties from ''Guilty Men''\".{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} The authors earned no money from the book as their literary agent, Ralph Pinker, absconded with the royalties.<ref name=\"Morgan, Michael Foot, ch 3\"/>\n\n==Publication==\n''Guilty Men'' was published in early July, shortly after Churchill became Prime Minister, the [[Dunkirk evacuation]] had shown Britain's military unpreparedness, and the [[Battle of France|Fall of France]] leaving the country with few allies.

For example, the authors muddled the place and date where Baldwin said that re-armament was unpopular with the voters. They placed it at the [[1933 Fulham East by-election]], instead of the [[1935 United Kingdom general election|1935 general election]], and dated the by-election to 1935.
