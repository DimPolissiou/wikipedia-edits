non-ferromagnetic materials, there are a few types that are weakly ferromagnetic. Accordingly, IVC filters fall under the MRI Safe and MRI Conditional categories depending mostly on type of material used during construction.  Rarely will one find an MRI Not Safe IVC filter, as most of the steel, and other ferromagnetic material devices have been discontinued via the FDA.\n\nIVC filters are attached to the vena cava via hooks on their ends. Some are compression springs, which compress outward onto the side wall of the vena cava; however, they still have small hooks that retain their location.  These hooks aid in the anchoring and healing process, as they allow the tissues to 'ingrow' around them, securing the IVC in place.  It is unlikely, then, after 4 to 6 weeks of healing, that an MRI of 1.5 tesla, up to 3 tesla, will cause any level of dislodging to occur to the IVC filter.\n\nStudies of MR examination of both animals and humans, with implanted IVC filters, have not reported complications or symptomatic filter displacement.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Watanabe AT, Teitelbaum GP, Gomes AS, ((Roehm JO Jr)) | year = 1990 | title = MR imaging of the bird's nest filter | url = | journal = Radiology | volume = 177 | issue = 2| pages = 578\u2013579 | doi=10.1148/radiology.177.2.2217801| pmid = 2217801 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Kiproff PM, Deeb ZL, Contractor FM, Khoury MB | year = 1991 | title = Magnetic resonance characteristics of the LGM vena cava filter: technical note | url = | journal = Cardiovasc Intervent Radiol | volume = 14 | issue = 4| pages = 254\u2013255 | doi=10.1007/bf02578474| pmid = 1913742 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Kim D, Edelman RR, Margolin CJ, Porter DH, McArdle CR, Schlam BW, Gianturco LE, Siegel JB, Simon M | year = 1992 | title = The Simon nitinol filter: evaluation by MR and ultrasound | url = | journal = Angiology | volume = 43 | issue = 7| pages = 541\u2013548 | doi=10.1177/000331979204300701| pmid = 1626731 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Grassi CJ, Matsumoto AH, Teitelbaum GP | year = 1992 | title = Vena caval occlusion after Simon nitinol filter placement: identification with MR imaging in patients with malignancy | url = | journal = J Vasc Interv Radiol | volume = 3 | issue = 3| pages = 535\u2013539 | doi=10.1016/s1051-0443(92)72008-9| pmid = 1515724 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Bartels LW, Bakker CJ, Viergever MA | year = 2002 | title = Improved lumen visualization in metallic vascular implants by reducing RF artifacts | url = | journal = Magn Reson Med | volume = 47 | issue = 1| pages = 171\u2013180 | doi=10.1002/mrm.10004| pmid = 11754456 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Liebman CE, Messersmith RN, Levin DN, Lu CT | year = 1988 | title = MR imaging of inferior vena caval filters: safety and artifacts | url = | journal = American Journal of Roentgenology | volume = 150 | issue = 5| pages = 1174\u20131176 | doi=10.2214/ajr.150.5.1174| pmid = 3258722 }}</ref>\n\nSeveral animal studies have even used \"real-time\" MR for the placement of IVC filters to check for rotation, sheering, and other artifacts.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Bucker A, Neuerburg JM, Adam GB, Glowinski A, Schaeffter T, Rasche V, van Vaals JJ, G\u00fcnther RW | year = 2001 | title = Real-time MR guidance for inferior vena cava filter placement in an animal model | url = | journal = J Vasc Interv Radiol | volume = 12 | issue = 6| pages = 753\u2013756 | doi=10.1016/s1051-0443(07)61448-1| pmid = 11389228 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Frahm C, Gehl HB, Lorch H, Zwaan M, Drobnitzky M, Laub GA, Weiss HD | year = 1998 | title = MR-guided placement of a temporary vena cava filter: technique and feasibility | url = | journal = J Magn Reson Imaging | volume = 8 | issue = 1| pages = 105\u2013109 | doi=10.1002/jmri.1880080121| pmid = 9500268 }}</ref>\n\nAs part of the 'routing' survey for MRI studies, patients who have IVC filters will often need verification from the doctor, or medical records, to state that the IVC is safe for the MRI.  Most patients with weakly or non-safe ferromagnetic implants will be given a card, which they keep on their person at all time, that can help isolate if it is safe to do an MRI.\n\nFor patients who have been denied MRI scans for safety reasons, doctors usually recommend the CT scan with contrast as an alternative.\n\n=== Labeling and recommendations ===\nMost IVC filters that have been tested have been labeled as \u201cMRi safe\u201d; the remainder of IVC filters that have been tested are \u201cMR conditional.\u201d Patients who have been treated with nonferromagnetic IVC filters can undergo MR examination any time after filter implantation. In patients who have been treated with a weakly ferromagnetic IVC filter (Gianturco bird nest IVC filter [Cook], stainless steel Greenfield vena cava filter [Boston Scientific]), it is advised that the patient wait at least six weeks before undergoing an MR examination (because these older devices initially may not be anchored as firmly in place as other devices discussed in the present context), unless there is a strong clinical indication to perform the MR examination sooner after implantation, and as long as there is no reason to suspect that the device is not positioned properly or that it is not firmly in place. Most studies of IVC filters have generally been conducted at 1.5 tesla or less, although many IVC filters have now been evaluated at 3 tesla and deemed acceptable for MR examination.<ref>MRI safety.

Historically, IVC filters were placed surgically, but with modern filters that can be compressed into much thinner [[catheter]]s, access to the venous system can be obtained via the [[femoral vein]] (the large vein in the groin), the [[internal jugular vein]] (the large vein in the neck) or the arm veins with one design.  Choice of route depends mainly on the number and location of any [[blood clot]] within the venous system.  To place the filter, a catheter is guided into the IVC using fluoroscopic guidance, then the filter is pushed through the catheter and deployed into the desired location, usually just below the junction of the IVC and the lowest [[renal vein]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Kinney|first=Thomas|author2=Cameron, S |author3=Sass, P |author4=Zoller, M |author5= Wigler, M |title=Inferior Vena Cava Filters|journal=Seminars in Interventional Radiology|date=1 September 2006|volume=23|issue=3|pages=230\u2013239|doi=10.1055/s-2006-948760|pmc=3036373|pmid=21326769}}</ref>\n\nReview of prior cross-sectional imaging or a venogram of the IVC is performed before deploying the filter to assess for potential anatomic variations, thrombi within the IVC, or areas of stenoses, as well as to estimate the diameter of the IVC.  Rarely, ultrasound-guided placement is preferred in the setting of contrast allergy, [[chronic kidney disease]], and when patient immobility is desired.  The size of the IVC may affect which filter is deployed, as some (such as the Birds Nest) are approved to accommodate larger cavae.  There are situations where the filter is placed above the renal veins (e.g. pregnant patients or women of childbearing age, renal or gonadal vein thromboses, etc.).

Prior to 2004, filters that had been in the IVC for less than three weeks were considered suitable to attempt retrieval, as filters that have been in place longer might have been overgrown by cells from the IVC wall and there was an increased risk of IVC injury if the filter is dislodged.

non-ferromagnetic materials, there are a few types that are weakly ferromagnetic. Accordingly, IVC filters fall under the MRI Safe and MRI Conditional categories depending mostly on type of material used during construction.  Rarely will one find an MRI Not Safe IVC filter, as most of the steel, and other ferromagnetic material devices have been discontinued via the FDA.\n\nIVC filters are attached to the vena cava via hooks on their ends. Some are compression springs, which compress outward onto the side wall of the vena cava; however, they still have small hooks that retain their location.  These hooks aid in the anchoring and healing process, as they allow the tissues to 'ingrow' around them, securing the IVC in place.  It is unlikely, then, after 4 to 6 weeks of healing, that an MRI of 1.5 tesla, up to 3 tesla, will cause any level of dislodging to occur to the IVC filter.\n\nStudies of MR examination of both animals and humans, with implanted IVC filters, have not reported complications or symptomatic filter displacement.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Watanabe AT, Teitelbaum GP, Gomes AS, ((Roehm JO Jr)) | year = 1990 | title = MR imaging of the bird's nest filter | url = | journal = Radiology | volume = 177 | issue = 2| pages = 578\u2013579 | doi=10.1148/radiology.177.2.2217801| pmid = 2217801 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Kiproff PM, Deeb ZL, Contractor FM, Khoury MB | year = 1991 | title = Magnetic resonance characteristics of the LGM vena cava filter: technical note | url = | journal = Cardiovasc Intervent Radiol | volume = 14 | issue = 4| pages = 254\u2013255 | doi=10.1007/bf02578474| pmid = 1913742 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Kim D, Edelman RR, Margolin CJ, Porter DH, McArdle CR, Schlam BW, Gianturco LE, Siegel JB, Simon M | year = 1992 | title = The Simon nitinol filter: evaluation by MR and ultrasound | url = | journal = Angiology | volume = 43 | issue = 7| pages = 541\u2013548 | doi=10.1177/000331979204300701| pmid = 1626731 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Grassi CJ, Matsumoto AH, Teitelbaum GP | year = 1992 | title = Vena caval occlusion after Simon nitinol filter placement: identification with MR imaging in patients with malignancy | url = | journal = J Vasc Interv Radiol | volume = 3 | issue = 3| pages = 535\u2013539 | doi=10.1016/s1051-0443(92)72008-9| pmid = 1515724 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Bartels LW, Bakker CJ, Viergever MA | year = 2002 | title = Improved lumen visualization in metallic vascular implants by reducing RF artifacts | url = | journal = Magn Reson Med | volume = 47 | issue = 1| pages = 171\u2013180 | doi=10.1002/mrm.10004| pmid = 11754456 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Liebman CE, Messersmith RN, Levin DN, Lu CT | year = 1988 | title = MR imaging of inferior vena caval filters: safety and artifacts | url = | journal = American Journal of Roentgenology | volume = 150 | issue = 5| pages = 1174\u20131176 | doi=10.2214/ajr.150.5.1174| pmid = 3258722 }}</ref>\n\nSeveral animal studies have even used \"real-time\" MR for the placement of IVC filters to check for rotation, sheering, and other artifacts.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Bucker A, Neuerburg JM, Adam GB, Glowinski A, Schaeffter T, Rasche V, van Vaals JJ, G\u00fcnther RW | year = 2001 | title = Real-time MR guidance for inferior vena cava filter placement in an animal model | url = | journal = J Vasc Interv Radiol | volume = 12 | issue = 6| pages = 753\u2013756 | doi=10.1016/s1051-0443(07)61448-1| pmid = 11389228 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Frahm C, Gehl HB, Lorch H, Zwaan M, Drobnitzky M, Laub GA, Weiss HD | year = 1998 | title = MR-guided placement of a temporary vena cava filter: technique and feasibility | url = | journal = J Magn Reson Imaging | volume = 8 | issue = 1| pages = 105\u2013109 | doi=10.1002/jmri.1880080121| pmid = 9500268 }}</ref>\n\nAs part of the 'routing' survey for MRI studies, patients who have IVC filters will often need verification from the doctor, or medical records, to state that the IVC is safe for the MRI.  Most patients with weakly or non-safe ferromagnetic implants will be given a card, which they keep on their person at all time, that can help isolate if it is safe to do an MRI.\n\nFor patients who have been denied MRI scans for safety reasons, doctors usually recommend the CT scan with contrast as an alternative.\n\n=== Labeling and recommendations ===\nMost IVC filters that have been tested have been labeled as \u201cMRi safe\u201d; the remainder of IVC filters that have been tested are \u201cMR conditional.\u201d Patients who have been treated with nonferromagnetic IVC filters can undergo MR examination any time after filter implantation. In patients who have been treated with a weakly ferromagnetic IVC filter (Gianturco bird nest IVC filter [Cook], stainless steel Greenfield vena cava filter [Boston Scientific]), it is advised that the patient wait at least six weeks before undergoing an MR examination (because these older devices initially may not be anchored as firmly in place as other devices discussed in the present context), unless there is a strong clinical indication to perform the MR examination sooner after implantation, and as long as there is no reason to suspect that the device is not positioned properly or that it is not firmly in place. Most studies of IVC filters have generally been conducted at 1.5 tesla or less, although many IVC filters have now been evaluated at 3 tesla and deemed acceptable for MR examination.<ref>MRI safety.

Historically, IVC filters were placed surgically, but with modern filters that can be compressed into much thinner [[catheter]]s, access to the venous system can be obtained via the [[femoral vein]] (the large vein in the groin), the [[internal jugular vein]] (the large vein in the neck) or the arm veins with one design.  Choice of route depends mainly on the number and location of any [[blood clot]] within the venous system.  To place the filter, a catheter is guided into the IVC using fluoroscopic guidance, then the filter is pushed through the catheter and deployed into the desired location, usually just below the junction of the IVC and the lowest [[renal vein]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Kinney|first=Thomas|author2=Cameron, S |author3=Sass, P |author4=Zoller, M |author5= Wigler, M |title=Inferior Vena Cava Filters|journal=Seminars in Interventional Radiology|date=1 September 2006|volume=23|issue=3|pages=230\u2013239|doi=10.1055/s-2006-948760|pmc=3036373|pmid=21326769}}</ref>\n\nReview of prior cross-sectional imaging or a venogram of the IVC is performed before deploying the filter to assess for potential anatomic variations, thrombi within the IVC, or areas of stenoses, as well as to estimate the diameter of the IVC.  Rarely, ultrasound-guided placement is preferred in the setting of contrast allergy, [[chronic kidney disease]], and when patient immobility is desired.  The size of the IVC may affect which filter is deployed, as some (such as the Birds Nest) are approved to accommodate larger cavae.  There are situations where the filter is placed above the renal veins (e.g. pregnant patients or women of childbearing age, renal or gonadal vein thromboses, etc.).  Also, if there is duplication of the IVC, the filter is placed above the confluence of the two IVCs <ref>{{cite journal|last=Mano|first=Tatsumi T|author2=Sakai H |title=A case of deep venous thrombosis with a double inferior vena cava effectively treated by suprarenal filter implantation.|journal=Japanese Heart Journal|year=2004|volume=45|issue=6|pages=1063\u20131069|doi=10.1536/jhj.45.1063|pmid=15655283|display-authors=etal}}</ref> or a filter can be placed within each IVC.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Sartori|first=MT|author2=Zampieri P |author3=Andres AL |author4=Prandoni P |author5=Motta R |author6=Miotto D |title=Double vena cava filter insertion in congenital duplicated inferior vena cava: a case report and literature review.|journal=Haematologica|year=2006|volume=91|series=6|issue=ECR30}}</ref>\n\n==Retrieval==\nThe concept of a removable IVC filter was first concieved in 1967.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Williams R, Schenk W | year = 1970 | title = A removable intracaval filter for prevention of pulmonary embolism: early experience with the use of the Eichelter catheter in patients | url = | journal = Surgery | volume = 68 | issue = 6| pages = 999\u20131008 | pmid = 5483252 }}</ref>  In 2003 and 2004 that the United States Food and Drug Administration first approved retrieavable filters.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Kaufman J | year = 2004 | title = Retrievable vena cava filters | url = | journal = Tech Vasc Interv Radiol | volume = 7 | issue = 2| pages = 96\u2013104 | pmid = 15252767 | doi = 10.1053/j.tvir.2004.02.006 }}</ref>  In 2005 that the Society of Interventional Radiology (SIR) convened a multidisciplinary conference to address the clinical application of nonpermanent vena cava filters.\n\nRetrievable filters are fitted with a device (varying from model to model) that allows them to be easily [[vascular snare|snared]] and pulled back into a catheter and removed from the body, often through the [[jugular vein]]. Prior to 2004, filters that had been in the IVC for less than three weeks were considered suitable to attempt retrieval, as filters that have been in place longer might have been overgrown by cells from the IVC wall and there was an increased risk of IVC injury if the filter is dislodged. Newer designs, and developments in techniques mean that some filters can now be left in for prolonged periods and retrievals after a year are now being reported.<ref>{{cite journal  |vauthors=McKenzie S, etal | title = An Australian experience of retrievable inferior vena cava filters in patients with increased risk of thromboembolic disease | url = | journal = International Angiology | volume = 29 | issue = 1| pages = 53\u201357 }}</ref> This would include the ALN, Bard G2 and G2x, Option, Tulip and Celect filters.\n\nIt is important to note that the clinical exam prior to the removal of the filter is vital in understanding both the risk and pathophysiological effects removing the filter will have on the patient.

Its regiments were nominally the 1st Brigade of MGEN [[Joseph J. Reynolds]] 4th Division of [[George Henry Thomas|Thomas']] [[XIV Corps (Union Army)|XIV Corps]]. Operationally, they were detached from the division and serving as a mobile mounted infantry to support any of the army's corps. Col [[John T. Wilder]] was its commander. As initially organized. the brigade had the following regiments:|<ref>Blue Lightning: Wilder's Mounted Brigade in the Battle of Chickamauga, Richard A.

Miller\n* [[18th Independent Battery Indiana Light Artillery]]\n[[File:John T Wilder monument Chickamauga.jpg|thumb|Monument to Wilder and his Lightning Brigade at [[Chickamauga and Chattanooga National Military Park]]]]\n\n\n==Formation==\nIn response to [[John Hunt Morgan]]\u2019s October 1862 raid, the brigade was sent by Major General [[William Rosecrans|William S. Rosecrans]] in pursuit. In an effort move faster, the brigade mounted in mule wagons. The brigade nearly caught Morgan, but when they entered the last rebel bivouac, Morgan had escaped. In this effort, John T. Wilder served as the commander of the 17th Indiana, one of the component regiments in the brigade.\n\nOn 22 December, 1862 in Gallatin, Tennessee, John T. Wilder took over command of the brigade which at that time consisted of the 92nd and 98th Illinois Infantry Regiments, the 17th, 72nd, and [[75th Indiana Infantry]] Regiments, and the 18th Indiana Battery of Light Artillery. His intial combat mission was to pursue another of Morgan\u2019s raids into Kentucky intended to sever the Army of the Cumberland's primary supply line. Lacking sufficient cavlary to screen his army as he moved south toward what would be the [[Second Battle of Murfreesboro|Battle of Stones River]] as part of the [[Stones River Campaign]], Rosecrans again had to use infantry to chase off Morgan. Trying to speed their movement, these infantry units deployed partially by rail. Wilder also unsuccessfully tried to replicate the use of mule-drawn wagons with the addition of men mounting the mules pulling the wagons<ref>[https://www.oocities.org/wildersbrigade/history.html</ref>. Unfortunately, they still traveled the majority of the pursuit on foot over unimproved, that is unpaved, roads. Despite the use of rail and wagons to speed up the pursuit, the mission was a failure with Morgan's command escaping at the the Rolling Fork River.<ref>The History of Morgan\u2019s Cavalry, Basil W. Duke, Indiana University Press</ref><ref>John Hunt Morgan and his Raiders, Edison H. Thomas, University of KY Press</ref>The difference in speed between cavalry and infantry was too much from the start.\n\nAs a result of the failure, Rosecrans and his subordinates revisited the experiment with wagons from the October events and realized the solution to their problems was the early role of dragoons as mounted infantrymen. Several times, Rosecrans wrot to the Union General-in-Chief Major General [[Henry Wager Halleck]] stating his intention to convert/establish units of mounted infantry. He also felt that he needed to outfit all of his cavalry with repeating weapons. When he felt he was not being heard, he went over Halleck directly to War Secretary Edward M Stanton. In a dispatch from 2 February, he explained his reasons to Scretary Stanton:\n{{Quote\n|text=I telegraphed the General-in-Chief that 2,000 carbines or revolving rifles were required to arm our cavalry.\nHe replied as though he thought it a complaint.\nOne rebel cavalryman takes on an average three of our infantry to watch our communications, while our progress is made slow and cautious, and we command the forage of the country only be sending large train guards.\nIt is of prime necessity, in every point of view, to master their cavalry.  I propose to do this, first, by so arming our cavalry as to give it its maximum strength.  Second, by having animals and saddles temporarily to mount infantry brigades for marches and enterprises.<ref>[https://www.oocities.org/wildersbrigade/history.html</ref>\n}}\n\nWilder, an innovative and creatuve man, was an eager advocate to Rosecrans for mounted infantry as a solution. On 12 February 1863, Rosecrans ordered Wilder to find mounts for his brigade. The regiments also voted on whether to convert to mounted infantry.  All but the 75th Indiana voted to change to mounted infantry. The 123rd Illinois who had wanted to become mounted infantry transferred from the 1st Brigade of the 5th Division of XIV Corps to replace them. Through February 1863, Wilder he obtained around a thousand mules to mount his command. Due to the obstinacy of the mules, horses were frequently seized from local stocks in Tennessee as contraband and replaced the mules.\n\nFrom the outset, the brigade used their mounts to travel rapidly to contact, but once engaged with the enemy, the soldiers fought dismounted. It was due to this speed of deployment that the unit earned the nickname, \u201cThe Lightning Brigade,\u201d and it would prove the validity of its conversion in the campaign in the Western theater. They were also sometimes known as the \"Hatchet Brigade\" because they received long-handled [[hatchet]]s to carry instead of [[cavalry]] [[Sabre|saber]]s.\n\nAs well as mounting the command for faster deployment, Wilder felt that muzzle-loaded rifles were too difficult to use traveling on horseback. Like Rosecrans, he also believed that the superiority of repeating rifles were worth their price in return for the great increase in firepower. The repeating rifles also had the standoff range similar to the standard infantry [[Lorenz rifle|Lorenzes]], [[Springfield Model 1861|Springfields,]] and [[Pattern 1853 Enfield|Enfields]] in use by the Army of the Cumberland. He felt the repeating and breechloading carbines in use by the Federal cavalry that lacked the accuracy at long range that his brigade would need. \n\nWhile Rosecrans looked at the the regiment's five-shot [[Colt revolving rifle]] that would equip other units in the Army of the Cumberland (particularly seeing action with the [[21st Ohio Infantry|21st Ohio Volunteer Infantry]] Union forces at [[Snodgrass Hill]] during the [[Battle of Chickamauga]]), Wilder was initially opting for the [[Henry rifle|Henry]] repeating rifle as the proper weapon to arm his brigade. In early March, Wilder arranged a proposal for [[New Haven Arms Company]] (which later became famous as Winchester Repeating Arms) to supply his brigade with the sixteen-shot Henry if the soldiers paid for the weapons out of pocket. He had received backing from banks in Indiana on loans to be signed by each soldier and cosigned by Wilder. New Haven could come agreement with Wilder despite the financing.<ref>https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/25/colonel-wilders-lightning-brigade/</ref>,ref>https://www.historynet.com/battle-of-chickamauga-colonel-john-wilders-lightning-brigade-prevented-total-disaster.htm</ref>\n\nAfter attending a promotional demonstration by [[Christopher Spencer]] for the Army of the Cumberland of his [[Spencer repeating rifle]]<ref>[http://www.civilwar.si.edu/weapons_spencer.html A Spencer at the Smithsonian Institution]</ref>, Wilder proposed the Henry arangement to Spencer. Spencer agreed and got the Ordnance Department to send a shipment to the Army of the Cumberland. Embarrassed, the Government paid for the weapons before the men expended any of their personal money.<ref>Cozzens, p. 15; Korn, p. 21.</ref>The majority of the shipment armed all men of the brigade.\n\nThe brigade\u2019s new weapon had a tubular magazine that held seven rimfire cartridges and, it would soon prove to be one of the most deadly weapons in the Civil War. With new mounts and new weapons, the brigade worked out new tactics. Wilder and other mounted infantry units in the Army of the Cumberland developed new methods. \n\n==[[Tullahoma Campaign]]==\n\n===Hoover's Gap===\n{{main|Battle of Hoover's Gap}}\nOn June 23, 1863, Rosecrans deployed forces to feign an attack on [[Shelbyville, Tennessee|Shelbyville]] while massing forces against Bragg's right. His troops struck out toward Liberty, Hoover's, and Bellbuckle Gaps through the [[Highland Rim]] (near [[Beechgrove, Coffee County, Tennessee|Beechgrove, Tennessee]]). On June 24 in pouring rain that would persist for 17 days (Union soldiers spread the humorous rumor during the campaign that the name Tullahoma was a combination of the Greek words \"tulla\", meaning \"mud\", and \"homa\", meaning \"more mud\".)<ref>Eicher, p. 496; Korn, p. 29.</ref>, Maj. Gen. [[George Henry Thomas|George H. Thomas's]] men, spearheaded by Colonel [[John T. Wilder]]'s \"Lightning Brigade\", made for [[Battle of Hoover's Gap|Hoover's Gap]]. The brigade showed the advantage of their speed despite the weather by reaching the gap nearly 9 miles ahead of Thomas's main body.<ref name=\"Kennedy225\">Kennedy, p. 225.</ref> Despite orders from the divisional commander, General [[Joseph J. Reynolds]] to fall back to his infantry, which was still six miles away, Wilder decided to take and hold the position. \n\nThe command surprised the Confederate 1st (3rd) Kentucky Cavalry Regiment, under Colonel J. Russell Butler at the entrance of the gap<ref name=\"NPS\">[http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/abpp/battles/tn017.htm National Park Service battle description] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318161310/http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/abpp/battles/tn017.htm |date=March 18, 2009 }}</ref>. After skirmishing briefly and withdrawing under pressure, the rebels were unable to reach the gap before the better-fed horses of the Lightning Brigade. The Kentuckians fell apart as a unit and, unluckily for the Confederates, failed in their cavalry mission to provide intelligence of the Union movement to their higher headquarters. Although Wilder's main infantry support was well behind his mounted brigade and his division commander Major General [[Joseph J. Reynolds]] had directed him to fall back to the main force after contact, he determined to continue pushing through the Gap and hold it before the Confederate reinforcements could arrive. The brigade drove the 1st Kentucky through the entire seven mile length of Hoover's Gap. At the other end, they were met with artillery fire and found out that the brigade and its one battery were outnumbered four-to-one <ref>https://www.battlefields.org/learn/primary-sources/battle-hoovers-gap</ref>. The brigade had met Brig. Gen. [[William B. Bate]]'s brigade of Maj. Gen. [[Alexander P. Stewart]]'s division.<ref name=\"NPS\"/>.\n\nWilder entrenched on the hills south of the gap and determined to hold this extremely advanced position.<ref name=\"Kennedy225\"/>. The Bate's brigade, supported by Brig. Gen. [[Bushrod Johnson]]'s brigade and some artillery, assaulted Wilder's position, but was driven back by the concentrated fire of the Spencers, losing 146 killed and wounded (almost a quarter of his force) to Wilder's 61. Colonel James Connolly, commander of the 123rd Illinois, wrote:\n{{Quote\n|text=As soon as the enemy opened on us with their artillery we dismounted and formed line of battle on a hill just at the south entrance to the \"Gap,\" and our battery of light artillery was opened on them, a courier was dispatched to the rear to hurry up reinforcements, our horses were sent back some distance out of the way of bursting shells, our regiment was assigned to support the battery, the other three regiments were properly disposed, and not a moment too soon, for these preparations were scarcely completed when the enemy opened on us a terrific fire of shot and shell from five different points, and their masses of infantry, with flags flying, moved out of the woods on our right in splendid style; there were three or four times our number already in sight and still others came pouring out of the woods beyond. Our regiment lay on the hill side in mud and water, the rain pouring down in torrents, while each shell screamed so close to us as to make it seem that the next would tear us to pieces.\n<br>\nPresently the enemy got near enough to us to make a charge on our battery, and on they came; our men are on their feet in an instant and a terrible fire from the \"Spencers\" causes the advancing regiment to reel and its colors fall to the ground, but in an instant their colors are up again and on they come, thinking to reach the battery before our guns can be reloaded, but they \"reckoned without their host,\" they didn't know we had the \"Spencers,\" and their charging yell was answered by another terrible volley, and another and another without cessation, until the poor regiment was literally cut to pieces, and but few men of that 20th Tennessee that attempted the charge will ever charge again. During all the rest of the fight at \"Hoover's Gap\" they never again attempted to take that battery. After the charge they moved four regiments around to our right and attempted to get in our rear, but they were met by two of our regiments posted in the woods, and in five minutes were driven back in the greatest disorder, with a loss of 250 killed and wounded.<ref>Connolly, p. 92.</ref>\n}} \nAfter a long day of combat at 1900, the brigade's morale was uplifted by the arrival of a fresh battery at the gallop which meant the XIV Corps were close behind. A half hour, the Corps' the main infantry units arrived to secure the position against any further assaults. The corps commander, General Thomas, shook Wilder's hand and told him, \"You have saved the lives of a thousand men by your gallant conduct today. I didn't expect to get to this gap for three days.\"<ref>Woodworth, pp. 21-24; Connelly, pp. 126-27; Korn, pp. 24-26.</ref> Rosecrans also arrived on the scene.  Rather than reprimand Wilder for disobeying orders, he congratulated him for doing so, telling him it would have cost thousands of lives to take the position if he had abandoned it.<ref>{{cite book |last=Cozzens |first=Peter |date=1992 |title=This Terrible Sound |isbn=0-252-01703-X |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/thisterriblesoun0000cozz }}</ref> \n\nOn June 25, Bate and Johnson renewed their attempts to drive the Union men out of Hoover's Gap but failed against the Lightning Brigade now with its parent division and corps. Rosecrans brought the forward movement of the Army of the Cumberland to a halt as the roads had become quagmires. Bragg took no effective action to counter Rosecrans because his cavalry commanders were not relaying intelligence to him reliably&mdash;Forrest was not informing of the weak nature of the Union right flank attack and Wheeler failed to report the movement of Crittenden's corps through Bradyville and toward Bragg's rear.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 28-30; Connelly, p. 127; Korn, p. 28.</ref>\n\nAs the Lighting Brigade and the 5th Division held at Hoover's Gap, Bragg soon came to realize the threat of Thomas. Meanwhile, Rosecrans shifted his forces to reinforce Thomas at the gap.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 31-33; Connelly, pp. 127-28; Korn, p. 28.</ref> Unfortunately for Bragg, infrequent direct communication with [[William J. Hardee]], his corps commander who commanded Stewart left an ignorance of Bragg's campaign strategy. That ignorance coupled with a low opinion of his commander's intellect, led Hardee to do what \"he deemed best for saving an army whose commander was an idiot.\"<ref>Woodworth, p. 33.</ref> That course was to order his force under Maj. Gen [[Alexander P. Stewart]] at Hoover's Gap to retreat towards Wartrace. His retreat served to only make Thomas's breakout more effective, leaving Bragg with his right flank gone. To keep his army together, he had to order Polk and Hardee to withdraw to Tullahoma on June 27.<ref>Woodworth, p. 34; Connelly, pp. 128-29; Lamers, pp. 280-82.</ref>  \n\n===The Raid ===\n[[Image:John T Wilder.jpg|thumb|left|John T. Wilder]]\nThe Lightning Brigade reached Manchester at 0800 on June 27, and the remainder of the division occupied the town by noon. On June 28, the brigade left on a raid to damage the railroad infrastructure in Bragg's rear, heading south toward Decherd, a small town on the [[Nashville, Chattanooga and St. Louis Railway|Nashville & Chattanooga Railroad]]. The rain-swollen [[Elk River (Tennessee)|Elk River]] proved a significant obstacle, but they disassembled a nearby mill and constructed a raft to float their [[howitzer]]s across. They defeated a small garrison of Confederates in Decherd, tore up 300 yards of track and a burned the railroad depot filled with Confederate rations. The next morning they rode into the foothills of the Cumberland Mountains, reaching the town of [[Sewanee, Tennessee|Sewanee]] where they destroyed a branch rail line. Although pursued by a larger Confederate force, the Lightning Brigade was back in Manchester by noon, June 30. They had not lost a single man on their raid.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 36-38.</ref>\n\nThe effectiveness of the brigade led to an operational detachment from the division command while maintaining an administrative link to Reynold's division. Operationally, the brigade would act independently as a mobile reserve for the army.\n\nWith his corps commanders unnerved by the Lightning Brigade's raid, at 3 p.m. on June 30, Bragg issued orders for a nighttime withdrawal from fortifications in Tullahoma across the Elk River. By leaving before the Union assault, Bragg gave up an opportunity to inflict potentially serious damage on the Army of the Cumberland.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 38-40; Connelly, pp. 130-32; Lamers, pp. 284-85; Korn, p. 30.</ref> Initially positioned below the Elk River, Hardee and Polk felt they should retreat farther south, to the town of Cowan. In turn, their loss of nerve passed to Bragg who deemed Cowan indefensible on July 2. Without consulting his corps commanders, on July 3 Bragg ordered a retreat to Chattanooga. The army crossed the Tennessee River on July 4; a cavalry pursuit under Phil Sheridan was not successful in trapping the rear guard of Bragg's army before they crossed the river. All the Confederate units had encamped near [[Lookout Mountain]] by July 7.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 40-42; Connelly, p. 133; Lamers, pp. 285-88.</ref>\n\n\n==Second Battle of Chattanooga==\n\n==[[Chickamauga Campaign]]==\nJust before the start of the [[Battle of Chickamauga]], Wilder's brigade played a crucial role at Alexander's Bridge on September 18, 1863, defending the crossing of West [[Chickamauga Creek]] and helping to prevent the Confederates from flanking the Union army.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 83-84.</ref> On the second day at Chickamauga, September 20, Wilder's brigade with its superior firepower was one of the few units that was not immediately routed by the Confederate onslaught against the Union right flank. Advancing from its reserve position, the brigade launched a strong counterattack, driving the enemy around and through what became known as \"Bloody Pond\". Wilder decided to capitalize on this success by attacking the flank of the main Confederate column. However, just then Assistant [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[Charles Anderson Dana|Charles A. Dana]] found Wilder and excitedly proclaimed that the battle was lost and demanded to be escorted to Chattanooga. In the time that Wilder took to calm down the secretary and arrange a small detachment to escort him back to safety, the opportunity for a successful attack was lost and he ordered his men to withdraw to the west.<ref>Cozzens, pp. 376-90, 392-96; Woodworth, pp. 118-19.</ref>\n\n==Reorganization/Disestablishment==\n\n\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* Baumgartner, Richard A.

Its regiments were nominally the 1st Brigade of MGEN [[Joseph J. Reynolds]] 4th Division of [[George Henry Thomas|Thomas']] [[XIV Corps (Union Army)|XIV Corps]]. Operationally, they were detached from the division and serving as a mobile mounted infantry to support any of the army's corps. Col [[John T. Wilder]] was its commander. As initially organized. the brigade had the following regiments:|<ref>Blue Lightning: Wilder's Mounted Brigade in the Battle of Chickamauga, Richard A.

Miller\n* [[18th Independent Battery Indiana Light Artillery]]\n[[File:John T Wilder monument Chickamauga.jpg|thumb|Monument to Wilder and his Lightning Brigade at [[Chickamauga and Chattanooga National Military Park]]]]\n\n\n==Formation==\nIn response to [[John Hunt Morgan]]\u2019s October 1862 raid, the brigade was sent by Major General [[William Rosecrans|William S. Rosecrans]] in pursuit. In an effort move faster, the brigade mounted in mule wagons. The brigade nearly caught Morgan, but when they entered the last rebel bivouac, Morgan had escaped. In this effort, John T. Wilder served as the commander of the 17th Indiana, one of the component regiments in the brigade.\n\nOn 22 December, 1862 in Gallatin, Tennessee, John T. Wilder took over command of the brigade which at that time consisted of the 92nd and 98th Illinois Infantry Regiments, the 17th, 72nd, and [[75th Indiana Infantry]] Regiments, and the 18th Indiana Battery of Light Artillery. His intial combat mission was to pursue another of Morgan\u2019s raids into Kentucky intended to sever the Army of the Cumberland's primary supply line. Lacking sufficient cavlary to screen his army as he moved south toward what would be the [[Second Battle of Murfreesboro|Battle of Stones River]] as part of the [[Stones River Campaign]], Rosecrans again had to use infantry to chase off Morgan. Trying to speed their movement, these infantry units deployed partially by rail. Wilder also unsuccessfully tried to replicate the use of mule-drawn wagons with the addition of men mounting the mules pulling the wagons<ref>[https://www.oocities.org/wildersbrigade/history.html</ref>. Unfortunately, they still traveled the majority of the pursuit on foot over unimproved, that is unpaved, roads. Despite the use of rail and wagons to speed up the pursuit, the mission was a failure with Morgan's command escaping at the the Rolling Fork River.<ref>The History of Morgan\u2019s Cavalry, Basil W. Duke, Indiana University Press</ref><ref>John Hunt Morgan and his Raiders, Edison H. Thomas, University of KY Press</ref>The difference in speed between cavalry and infantry was too much from the start.\n\nAs a result of the failure, Rosecrans and his subordinates revisited the experiment with wagons from the October events and realized the solution to their problems was the early role of dragoons as mounted infantrymen. Several times, Rosecrans wrot to the Union General-in-Chief Major General [[Henry Wager Halleck]] stating his intention to convert/establish units of mounted infantry. He also felt that he needed to outfit all of his cavalry with repeating weapons. When he felt he was not being heard, he went over Halleck directly to War Secretary Edward M Stanton. In a dispatch from 2 February, he explained his reasons to Scretary Stanton:\n{{Quote\n|text=I telegraphed the General-in-Chief that 2,000 carbines or revolving rifles were required to arm our cavalry.\nHe replied as though he thought it a complaint.\nOne rebel cavalryman takes on an average three of our infantry to watch our communications, while our progress is made slow and cautious, and we command the forage of the country only be sending large train guards.\nIt is of prime necessity, in every point of view, to master their cavalry.  I propose to do this, first, by so arming our cavalry as to give it its maximum strength.  Second, by having animals and saddles temporarily to mount infantry brigades for marches and enterprises.<ref>[https://www.oocities.org/wildersbrigade/history.html</ref>\n}}\n\nWilder, an innovative and creatuve man, was an eager advocate to Rosecrans for mounted infantry as a solution. On 12 February 1863, Rosecrans ordered Wilder to find mounts for his brigade. The regiments also voted on whether to convert to mounted infantry.  All but the 75th Indiana voted to change to mounted infantry. The 123rd Illinois who had wanted to become mounted infantry transferred from the 1st Brigade of the 5th Division of XIV Corps to replace them. Through February 1863, Wilder he obtained around a thousand mules to mount his command. Due to the obstinacy of the mules, horses were frequently seized from local stocks in Tennessee as contraband and replaced the mules.\n\nFrom the outset, the brigade used their mounts to travel rapidly to contact, but once engaged with the enemy, the soldiers fought dismounted. It was due to this speed of deployment that the unit earned the nickname, \u201cThe Lightning Brigade,\u201d and it would prove the validity of its conversion in the campaign in the Western theater. They were also sometimes known as the \"Hatchet Brigade\" because they received long-handled [[hatchet]]s to carry instead of [[cavalry]] [[Sabre|saber]]s.\n\nAs well as mounting the command for faster deployment, Wilder felt that muzzle-loaded rifles were too difficult to use traveling on horseback. Like Rosecrans, he also believed that the superiority of repeating rifles were worth their price in return for the great increase in firepower. The repeating rifles also had the standoff range similar to the standard infantry [[Lorenz rifle|Lorenzes]], [[Springfield Model 1861|Springfields,]] and [[Pattern 1853 Enfield|Enfields]] in use by the Army of the Cumberland. He felt the repeating and breechloading carbines in use by the Federal cavalry that lacked the accuracy at long range that his brigade would need. \n\nWhile Rosecrans looked at the the regiment's five-shot [[Colt revolving rifle]] that would equip other units in the Army of the Cumberland (particularly seeing action with the [[21st Ohio Infantry|21st Ohio Volunteer Infantry]] Union forces at [[Snodgrass Hill]] during the [[Battle of Chickamauga]]), Wilder was initially opting for the [[Henry rifle|Henry]] repeating rifle as the proper weapon to arm his brigade. In early March, Wilder arranged a proposal for [[New Haven Arms Company]] (which later became famous as Winchester Repeating Arms) to supply his brigade with the sixteen-shot Henry if the soldiers paid for the weapons out of pocket. He had received backing from banks in Indiana on loans to be signed by each soldier and cosigned by Wilder. New Haven could come agreement with Wilder despite the financing.<ref>https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/25/colonel-wilders-lightning-brigade/</ref>,ref>https://www.historynet.com/battle-of-chickamauga-colonel-john-wilders-lightning-brigade-prevented-total-disaster.htm</ref>\n\nAfter attending a promotional demonstration by [[Christopher Spencer]] for the Army of the Cumberland of his [[Spencer repeating rifle]]<ref>[http://www.civilwar.si.edu/weapons_spencer.html A Spencer at the Smithsonian Institution]</ref>, Wilder proposed the Henry arangement to Spencer. Spencer agreed and got the Ordnance Department to send a shipment to the Army of the Cumberland. Embarrassed, the Government paid for the weapons before the men expended any of their personal money.<ref>Cozzens, p. 15; Korn, p. 21.</ref>The majority of the shipment armed all men of the brigade.\n\nThe brigade\u2019s new weapon had a tubular magazine that held seven rimfire cartridges and, it would soon prove to be one of the most deadly weapons in the Civil War. With new mounts and new weapons, the brigade worked out new tactics. Wilder and other mounted infantry units in the Army of the Cumberland developed new methods. \n\n==[[Tullahoma Campaign]]==\n\n===Hoover's Gap===\n{{main|Battle of Hoover's Gap}}\nOn June 23, 1863, Rosecrans deployed forces to feign an attack on [[Shelbyville, Tennessee|Shelbyville]] while massing forces against Bragg's right. His troops struck out toward Liberty, Hoover's, and Bellbuckle Gaps through the [[Highland Rim]] (near [[Beechgrove, Coffee County, Tennessee|Beechgrove, Tennessee]]). On June 24 in pouring rain that would persist for 17 days (Union soldiers spread the humorous rumor during the campaign that the name Tullahoma was a combination of the Greek words \"tulla\", meaning \"mud\", and \"homa\", meaning \"more mud\".)<ref>Eicher, p. 496; Korn, p. 29.</ref>, Maj. Gen. [[George Henry Thomas|George H. Thomas's]] men, spearheaded by Colonel [[John T. Wilder]]'s \"Lightning Brigade\", made for [[Battle of Hoover's Gap|Hoover's Gap]]. The brigade showed the advantage of their speed despite the weather by reaching the gap nearly 9 miles ahead of Thomas's main body.<ref name=\"Kennedy225\">Kennedy, p. 225.</ref> Despite orders from the divisional commander, General [[Joseph J. Reynolds]] to fall back to his infantry, which was still six miles away, Wilder decided to take and hold the position. \n\nThe command surprised the Confederate 1st (3rd) Kentucky Cavalry Regiment, under Colonel J. Russell Butler at the entrance of the gap<ref name=\"NPS\">[http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/abpp/battles/tn017.htm National Park Service battle description] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318161310/http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/abpp/battles/tn017.htm |date=March 18, 2009 }}</ref>. After skirmishing briefly and withdrawing under pressure, the rebels were unable to reach the gap before the better-fed horses of the Lightning Brigade. The Kentuckians fell apart as a unit and, unluckily for the Confederates, failed in their cavalry mission to provide intelligence of the Union movement to their higher headquarters. Although Wilder's main infantry support was well behind his mounted brigade and his division commander Major General [[Joseph J. Reynolds]] had directed him to fall back to the main force after contact, he determined to continue pushing through the Gap and hold it before the Confederate reinforcements could arrive. The brigade drove the 1st Kentucky through the entire seven mile length of Hoover's Gap. At the other end, they were met with artillery fire and found out that the brigade and its one battery were outnumbered four-to-one <ref>https://www.battlefields.org/learn/primary-sources/battle-hoovers-gap</ref>. The brigade had met Brig. Gen. [[William B. Bate]]'s brigade of Maj. Gen. [[Alexander P. Stewart]]'s division.<ref name=\"NPS\"/>.\n\nWilder entrenched on the hills south of the gap and determined to hold this extremely advanced position.<ref name=\"Kennedy225\"/>. The Bate's brigade, supported by Brig. Gen. [[Bushrod Johnson]]'s brigade and some artillery, assaulted Wilder's position, but was driven back by the concentrated fire of the Spencers, losing 146 killed and wounded (almost a quarter of his force) to Wilder's 61. Colonel James Connolly, commander of the 123rd Illinois, wrote:\n{{Quote\n|text=As soon as the enemy opened on us with their artillery we dismounted and formed line of battle on a hill just at the south entrance to the \"Gap,\" and our battery of light artillery was opened on them, a courier was dispatched to the rear to hurry up reinforcements, our horses were sent back some distance out of the way of bursting shells, our regiment was assigned to support the battery, the other three regiments were properly disposed, and not a moment too soon, for these preparations were scarcely completed when the enemy opened on us a terrific fire of shot and shell from five different points, and their masses of infantry, with flags flying, moved out of the woods on our right in splendid style; there were three or four times our number already in sight and still others came pouring out of the woods beyond. Our regiment lay on the hill side in mud and water, the rain pouring down in torrents, while each shell screamed so close to us as to make it seem that the next would tear us to pieces.\n<br>\nPresently the enemy got near enough to us to make a charge on our battery, and on they came; our men are on their feet in an instant and a terrible fire from the \"Spencers\" causes the advancing regiment to reel and its colors fall to the ground, but in an instant their colors are up again and on they come, thinking to reach the battery before our guns can be reloaded, but they \"reckoned without their host,\" they didn't know we had the \"Spencers,\" and their charging yell was answered by another terrible volley, and another and another without cessation, until the poor regiment was literally cut to pieces, and but few men of that 20th Tennessee that attempted the charge will ever charge again. During all the rest of the fight at \"Hoover's Gap\" they never again attempted to take that battery. After the charge they moved four regiments around to our right and attempted to get in our rear, but they were met by two of our regiments posted in the woods, and in five minutes were driven back in the greatest disorder, with a loss of 250 killed and wounded.<ref>Connolly, p. 92.</ref>\n}} \nAfter a long day of combat at 1900, the brigade's morale was uplifted by the arrival of a fresh battery at the gallop which meant the XIV Corps were close behind. A half hour, the Corps' the main infantry units arrived to secure the position against any further assaults. The corps commander, General Thomas, shook Wilder's hand and told him, \"You have saved the lives of a thousand men by your gallant conduct today. I didn't expect to get to this gap for three days.\"<ref>Woodworth, pp. 21-24; Connelly, pp. 126-27; Korn, pp. 24-26.</ref> Rosecrans also arrived on the scene.  Rather than reprimand Wilder for disobeying orders, he congratulated him for doing so, telling him it would have cost thousands of lives to take the position if he had abandoned it.<ref>{{cite book |last=Cozzens |first=Peter |date=1992 |title=This Terrible Sound |isbn=0-252-01703-X |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/thisterriblesoun0000cozz }}</ref> \n\nOn June 25, Bate and Johnson renewed their attempts to drive the Union men out of Hoover's Gap but failed against the Lightning Brigade now with its parent division and corps. Rosecrans brought the forward movement of the Army of the Cumberland to a halt as the roads had become quagmires. Bragg took no effective action to counter Rosecrans because his cavalry commanders were not relaying intelligence to him reliably&mdash;Forrest was not informing of the weak nature of the Union right flank attack and Wheeler failed to report the movement of Crittenden's corps through Bradyville and toward Bragg's rear.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 28-30; Connelly, p. 127; Korn, p. 28.</ref>\n\nAs the Lighting Brigade and the 5th Division held at Hoover's Gap, Bragg soon came to realize the threat of Thomas. Meanwhile, Rosecrans shifted his forces to reinforce Thomas at the gap.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 31-33; Connelly, pp. 127-28; Korn, p. 28.</ref> Unfortunately for Bragg, infrequent direct communication with [[William J. Hardee]], his corps commander who commanded Stewart left an ignorance of Bragg's campaign strategy. That ignorance coupled with a low opinion of his commander's intellect, led Hardee to do what \"he deemed best for saving an army whose commander was an idiot.\"<ref>Woodworth, p. 33.</ref> That course was to order his force under Maj. Gen [[Alexander P. Stewart]] at Hoover's Gap to retreat towards Wartrace. His retreat served to only make Thomas's breakout more effective, leaving Bragg with his right flank gone. To keep his army together, he had to order Polk and Hardee to withdraw to Tullahoma on June 27.<ref>Woodworth, p. 34; Connelly, pp. 128-29; Lamers, pp. 280-82.</ref>  \n\n===The Raid ===\n[[Image:John T Wilder.jpg|thumb|left|John T. Wilder]]\nThe Lightning Brigade reached Manchester at 0800 on June 27, and the remainder of the division occupied the town by noon. On June 28, the brigade left on a raid to damage the railroad infrastructure in Bragg's rear, heading south toward Decherd, a small town on the [[Nashville, Chattanooga and St. Louis Railway|Nashville & Chattanooga Railroad]]. The rain-swollen [[Elk River (Tennessee)|Elk River]] proved a significant obstacle, but they disassembled a nearby mill and constructed a raft to float their [[howitzer]]s across. They defeated a small garrison of Confederates in Decherd, tore up 300 yards of track and a burned the railroad depot filled with Confederate rations. The next morning they rode into the foothills of the Cumberland Mountains, reaching the town of [[Sewanee, Tennessee|Sewanee]] where they destroyed a branch rail line. Although pursued by a larger Confederate force, the Lightning Brigade was back in Manchester by noon, June 30. They had not lost a single man on their raid.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 36-38.</ref>\n\nThe effectiveness of the brigade led to an operational detachment from the division command while maintaining an administrative link to Reynold's division. Operationally, the brigade would act independently as a mobile reserve for the army.\n\n==[[Chickamauga Campaign]]==\nJust before the start of the [[Battle of Chickamauga]], Wilder's brigade played a crucial role at Alexander's Bridge on September 18, 1863, defending the crossing of West [[Chickamauga Creek]] and helping to prevent the Confederates from flanking the Union army.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 83-84.</ref> On the second day at Chickamauga, September 20, Wilder's brigade with its superior firepower was one of the few units that was not immediately routed by the Confederate onslaught against the Union right flank. Advancing from its reserve position, the brigade launched a strong counterattack, driving the enemy around and through what became known as \"Bloody Pond\". Wilder decided to capitalize on this success by attacking the flank of the main Confederate column. However, just then Assistant [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[Charles Anderson Dana|Charles A. Dana]] found Wilder and excitedly proclaimed that the battle was lost and demanded to be escorted to Chattanooga. In the time that Wilder took to calm down the secretary and arrange a small detachment to escort him back to safety, the opportunity for a successful attack was lost and he ordered his men to withdraw to the west.<ref>Cozzens, pp. 376-90, 392-96; Woodworth, pp. 118-19.</ref>\n\n==Reorganization/Disestablishment==\n\n\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* Baumgartner, Richard A.

The detectives include Jake Peralta ([[Andy Samberg]]), who has a high rate of successful arrests and solved cases, in spite of his relaxed, carefree and (at times) childish attitude. He eventually falls for his stern, nerdy, by-the-book but loveable partner, Amy Santiago ([[Melissa Fumero]]). The hard-working but timid Charles Boyle ([[Joe Lo Truglio]]) is partnered with the stoic, aggressive and stern, Rosa Diaz ([[Stephanie Beatriz]]). The pair of older Detectives, Michael Hitchcock ([[Dirk Blocker]]) and Norm Scully ([[Joel McKinnon Miller]]) often seem incompetent, stupid and lazy, but have solved more cases over the years simply because they have been on the job much longer. \n\nThe detectives report to Lieutenant Terry Jeffords ([[Terry Crews]]), a gentle giant and devoted family man who initially has a phobia of going back to active field police work for fear of being killed in the line of duty and leaving his children fatherless. The precinct also includes sarcastic and dominating civilian administrator Gina Linetti ([[Chelsea Peretti]]), who dislikes her job, prioritizes her social media, and believes that dancing is her life goal.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{{See also|List of Brooklyn Nine-Nine characters}}\n<!-- Do not replace this with a table.

The series revolves around Jake Peralta ([[Andy Samberg]]), an immature but talented [[New York Police Department|NYPD]] detective in [[Brooklyn]]'s fictional 99th Precinct, who often comes into conflict with his new commanding officer, the serious and stern Captain Raymond Holt ([[Andre Braugher]]). The rest of the cast features [[Stephanie Beatriz]] as Rosa Diaz, [[Terry Crews]] as Terry Jeffords, [[Melissa Fumero]] as Amy Santiago, [[Joe Lo Truglio]] as Charles Boyle, [[Chelsea Peretti]] as Gina Linetti, [[Dirk Blocker]] as Michael Hitchcock, and [[Joel McKinnon Miller]] as Norm Scully.\n\nProduced as a [[single-camera]] comedy, [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] originally ordered 13 episodes for its first season, eventually expanding it to 22 episodes. ''Brooklyn Nine-Nine'' premiered on September 17, 2013. On May 10, 2018, Fox canceled the series after five seasons. The following day, [[NBC]] picked up the series for a sixth season; it premiered on NBC on January 10, 2019. On February 27, NBC renewed the series for a seventh season, which premiered on February 6, 2020. The series was renewed for an eighth season in November 2019, ahead of the premiere of its seventh season.\n\nThe series has been acclaimed by critics for its cast, especially Samberg, Beatriz, Fumero, and Braugher. It has won two [[Creative Arts Emmy Awards]] and a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Television Series \u2013 Musical or Comedy|Golden Globe Award for Best Television Series&nbsp;\u2013 Musical or Comedy]]. Samberg has won a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Television Series Musical or Comedy|Golden Globe Award for Best Actor&nbsp;\u2013 Television Series Musical or Comedy]], while Braugher has been nominated for three consecutive [[Primetime Emmy Awards]] for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series|Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series]] and has won two [[Critics' Choice Television Award for Best Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series|Critics' Choice Television Awards for Best Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series]]. The series has also received particular praise for its portrayal of serious issues whilst retaining a sense of humor. For its portrayal of [[LGBTQ+]] people, the series won a [[GLAAD Media Award]] for Outstanding Comedy Series. <!--Per WP:CITELEAD, references are not needed in the lead if it is sourced in the body of the article!-->{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Premise==\nSet in the fictional 99th Precinct of the [[New York City Police Department]] in [[Brooklyn]], ''Brooklyn Nine-Nine'' follows a team of detectives headed by the overly serious, newly appointed Captain Raymond Holt ([[Andre Braugher]]). The detectives include Jake Peralta ([[Andy Samberg]]), who has a high rate of successful arrests and solved cases, in spite of his relaxed, carefree and (at times) childish attitude. He eventually falls for his stern, nerdy, by-the-book but loveable partner, Amy Santiago ([[Melissa Fumero]]). The hard-working but timid Charles Boyle ([[Joe Lo Truglio]]) is partnered with the stoic, aggressive and stern, Rosa Diaz ([[Stephanie Beatriz]]). The pair of older Detectives, Michael Hitchcock ([[Dirk Blocker]]) and Norm Scully ([[Joel McKinnon Miller]]) often seem incompetent, stupid and lazy, but have solved more cases over the years simply because they have been on the job much longer. \n\nThe detectives report to Lieutenant Terry Jeffords ([[Terry Crews]]), a gentle giant and devoted family man who initially has a phobia of going back to active field police work for fear of being killed in the line of duty and leaving his children fatherless. The precinct also includes sarcastic and dominating civilian administrator Gina Linetti ([[Chelsea Peretti]]), who dislikes her job, prioritizes her social media, and believes that dancing is her life goal.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{{See also|List of Brooklyn Nine-Nine characters}}\n<!-- Do not replace this with a table.
