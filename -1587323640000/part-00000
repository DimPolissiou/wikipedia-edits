Up until 1966, the radio station was only on-air for three periods during the day; at morning, lunchtime, and evening.  This was partly due to many of the presenters being part-time freelancers who had to fit their radio appearances in with their normal daily working schedule.\n\nIn 1969, the station's [[mediumwave|medium wave]] [[AM radio|AM]] transmitting station was moved from a waterfront site in [[Hung Hom]] to the summit of Golden Hill in the [[New Territories]]. Although the new transmitters were much more powerful, the mountain-top site proved unsuitable for medium wave transmissions and reception in some areas has remained problematic ever since. In March 1969, RHK moved its headquarters to new purpose-built studios located at Broadcasting House ({{zh|t=\u5ee3\u64ad\u5927\u5ec8|labels=no}}) in [[Kowloon Tong]].\n\nA Public Affairs Television Unit was established in 1970 to produce TV programmes for required broadcast by independent channels. At that time, RTHK did not have its own television broadcast transmitters.\n\nIn 1973, RTHK set up its own radio newsroom. Prior to this, all news had been prepared by Government Information Services staff. Until 1969, headlines were sent to the studios every half-hour by [[teleprinter]] from the GIS headquarters in [[Central, Hong Kong|Central District]], while the three daily full bulletins were hand-delivered by a messenger. This arrangement became impractical following the move to the new studios in 1969, so initially a GIS newsroom was set up in Broadcasting House. This arrangement also proved unsatisfactory and RTHK's own journalists, who until then had been confined to producing magazine programmes, took over the entire news operation.\n\nIn 1976, the station's name was changed to \"'''Radio Television Hong Kong'''\" ('''RTHK''') to reflect its new involvement in television programme production. In the same year, it began to produce educational television programmes for schools after absorbing the previously independent Educational Television Unit.<ref>[http://rthk9.rthk.hk/classicschannel/history.htm \u7d93\u5178\u91cd\u6eab\u983b\u9053 CLASSICS CHANNEL \u2013 \u7d30\u8aaa\u6b77\u53f2 History]</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=ahSRDQAAQBAJ&pg=PA228 The British Official Film in South-East Asia: Malaya/Malaysia, Singapore and Hong Kong]</ref>\n\nIn 1986, RTHK headquarters moved across the road to the former Commercial Television studios, which were renamed Television House. The station's first News and Financial News channel, Radio 7, was established in November 1989.\n\nIn December 1994, RTHK launched its website and made its television productions, as well as content from its seven radio channels, available online. The website provided live broadcasts as well as a twelve-month archive (with the exception of [[Hong Kong Certificate of Education Examination|HKCEE]] and [[Hong Kong Advanced Level Examination|HKALE]] broadcasts in RTHK2 due to copyright issues with the [[Hong Kong Examinations and Assessment Authority]]). The website, presented in English, [[Traditional Chinese]] and [[Simplified Chinese]], initially offered free news via email three times per day, as well as online content.\n\nIn 2013, RTHK trialled and launched a new television channel. To support this new television operation, the government administration increased the station's funding by between HK$300&nbsp;million and HK$400&nbsp;million a year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?we_cat=5&art_id=135893&sid=40000932&con_type=3&d_str=20130726&fc=8|title=RTHK focuses on new channel|date=26 July 2013|work=The Standard|author=Siu Sai Wo|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714222105/http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?we_cat=5&art_id=135893&sid=40000932&con_type=3&d_str=20130726&fc=8|archivedate=14 July 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn April 2016, RTHK took over the analogue channel frequencies of [[Asia Television]] (ATV) after the latter's free television licence expired.<ref name=\"variety-licensepulled\">{{cite web|title=Hong Kong Government Strips ATV of Broadcast License|url=https://variety.com/2015/biz/asia/hong-kong-government-strips-atv-of-broadcast-license-1201464903/|website=Variety|accessdate=18 March 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"cd-rhtkanalog\">{{cite web|title=RTHK invited to provide analog TV service|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/hkedition/2015-04/03/content_19988835.htm|website=China Daily|accessdate=18 March 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn March 2017, as the Hong Kong government decided to terminate DAB services in Hong Kong, RTHK said that it would integrate the existing DAB programmes into existing AM and FM radio channels.

Up until 1966, the radio station was only on-air for three periods during the day; at morning, lunchtime, and evening.  This was partly due to many of the presenters being part-time freelancers who had to fit their radio appearances in with their normal daily working schedule.\n\nIn 1969, the station's [[mediumwave|medium wave]] [[AM radio|AM]] transmitting station was moved from a waterfront site in [[Hung Hom]] to the summit of Golden Hill in the [[New Territories]]. Although the new transmitters were much more powerful, the mountain-top site proved unsuitable for medium wave transmissions and reception in some areas has remained problematic ever since. In March 1969, RHK moved its headquarters to new purpose-built studios located at Broadcasting House ({{zh|t=\u5ee3\u64ad\u5927\u5ec8|labels=no}}) in [[Kowloon Tong]].\n\nA Public Affairs Television Unit was established in 1970 to produce TV programmes for required broadcast by independent channels. At that time, RTHK did not have its own television broadcast transmitters.\n\nIn 1973, RTHK set up its own radio newsroom. Prior to this, all news had been prepared by Government Information Services staff. Until 1969, headlines were sent to the studios every half-hour by [[teleprinter]] from the GIS headquarters in [[Central, Hong Kong|Central District]], while the three daily full bulletins were hand-delivered by a messenger. This arrangement became impractical following the move to the new studios in 1969, so initially a GIS newsroom was set up in Broadcasting House. This arrangement also proved unsatisfactory and RTHK's own journalists, who until then had been confined to producing magazine programmes, took over the entire news operation.\n\nIn 1976, the station's name was changed to \"'''Radio Television Hong Kong'''\" ('''RTHK''') to reflect its new involvement in television programme production. In the same year, it began to produce educational television programmes for schools after absorbing the previously independent Educational Television Unit.<ref>[http://rthk9.rthk.hk/classicschannel/history.htm \u7d93\u5178\u91cd\u6eab\u983b\u9053 CLASSICS CHANNEL \u2013 \u7d30\u8aaa\u6b77\u53f2 History]</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=ahSRDQAAQBAJ&pg=PA228 The British Official Film in South-East Asia: Malaya/Malaysia, Singapore and Hong Kong]</ref>\n\nIn 1986, RTHK headquarters moved across the road to the former Commercial Television studios, which were renamed Television House. The station's first News and Financial News channel, Radio 7, was established in November 1989.\n\nIn December 1994, RTHK launched its website and made its television productions, as well as content from its seven radio channels, available online. The website provided live broadcasts as well as a twelve-month archive (with the exception of [[Hong Kong Certificate of Education Examination|HKCEE]] and [[Hong Kong Advanced Level Examination|HKALE]] broadcasts in RTHK2 due to copyright issues with the [[Hong Kong Examinations and Assessment Authority]]). The website, presented in English, [[Traditional Chinese]] and [[Simplified Chinese]], initially offered free news via email three times per day, as well as online content.\n\nIn 2013, RTHK trialled and launched a new television channel. To support this new television operation, the government administration increased the station's funding by between HK$300&nbsp;million and HK$400&nbsp;million a year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?we_cat=5&art_id=135893&sid=40000932&con_type=3&d_str=20130726&fc=8|title=RTHK focuses on new channel|date=26 July 2013|work=The Standard|author=Siu Sai Wo|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714222105/http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?we_cat=5&art_id=135893&sid=40000932&con_type=3&d_str=20130726&fc=8|archivedate=14 July 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn April 2016, RTHK took over the analogue channel frequencies of [[Asia Television]] (ATV) after the latter's free television licence expired.<ref name=\"variety-licensepulled\">{{cite web|title=Hong Kong Government Strips ATV of Broadcast License|url=https://variety.com/2015/biz/asia/hong-kong-government-strips-atv-of-broadcast-license-1201464903/|website=Variety|accessdate=18 March 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"cd-rhtkanalog\">{{cite web|title=RTHK invited to provide analog TV service|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/hkedition/2015-04/03/content_19988835.htm|website=China Daily|accessdate=18 March 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn March 2017, as the Hong Kong government decided to terminate DAB services in Hong Kong, RTHK said that it would integrate the existing DAB programmes into existing AM and FM radio channels.

Ye s absolutely.\" Khatri says people have been posting photographs showing the posters that didn't get as much air-time, posters addressing the range of 'important' causes that news anchors have accused the March of ignoring, like education, inheritance and marital rights. By bringing up the manifesto to defend the posters, for instance, Pakistan Feminists isolated themselves from the supposedly provocative posters, and in fact confirm their 'vulgarity'. It implies that Pakistani feminists agree that feminism should operate within the bounds of 'respectability'. According to her accepting narratives prescribing boundaries of respectability are traps that needs to be avoided by feminists and not to be allowed to be cemented in any social discourse. Feminism with conditions is no feminism. It maintains the division between what is \u2018acceptable\u2019 and what is 'immodest', what is 'public' and 'private', allowed and not. It pits the two against each other, rewarding the feminists who rally for legal rights and work-life balance and slut-shaming those who reclaim gendered slurs and carry the posters they did at the March. She questions whether feminism to allow discriminate and gatekeeping, and this gatekeeping is patriarchy's way of bolstering the binary of purpose vs pleasure, where the feminism of purpose (health, education, marital rights) is 'good' feminism, and the feminism of pleasure (sexual politics, bodily autonomy, agency over time and leisure) is 'bad' feminism, 'immoral' and 'frivolous'. She explains as feminists use the language of real and serious, end up creating a distinction between 'actual' issues and 'pretended' ones and rush to clarify that feminists have included 'important' causes in our demands, end up suggesting that other causes are unimportant.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Khatri |first1=Sadia |title=Should feminists claim Aurat March\u2019s 'vulgar' posters?

Referring poster slogan \"Keep your dick pics to yourself.\" Ms. Mohydin says What seems to have affronted the male collective the most is the shattering of a fantasy world where women enjoy being subjected to unrequested pictures of male genitals. Poster slogan has hit them hard. It has upset them. And now, they are angry and trying to speak to us in a language that they think we'll understand. They tell us this is not feminism but fail to explain how. They tell us it's about sex, and as 'respectful' women, how dare we utter of it.<ref name=\"womansxplain\" /> \"When women make demands about their personal lives, their bodies, their sexuality, that's when people feel threatened,\" Dad said. \u201cSo it\u2019s OK to ask the government for the right to education but you can't say you are happily divorced because the breakdown of a matrimony is a shameful thing, a woman\u2019s failure, and you can\u2019t say 'don't send me dick pics' because so-called decent women don't use expressions like dick.\u201d Nobody seems to say anything to the sender, but the reluctant receiver is apparently the problem.

Ye s absolutely.\" Khatri says people have been posting photographs showing the posters that didn't get as much air-time, posters addressing the range of 'important' causes that news anchors have accused the March of ignoring, like education, inheritance and marital rights. By bringing up the manifesto to defend the posters, for instance, Pakistan Feminists isolated themselves from the supposedly provocative posters, and in fact confirm their 'vulgarity'. It implies that Pakistani feminists agree that feminism should operate within the bounds of 'respectability'. According to her accepting narratives prescribing boundaries of respectability are traps that needs to be avoided by feminists and not to be allowed to be cemented in any social discourse. Feminism with conditions is no feminism. It maintains the division between what is \u2018acceptable\u2019 and what is 'immodest', what is 'public' and 'private', allowed and not. It pits the two against each other, rewarding the feminists who rally for legal rights and work-life balance and slut-shaming those who reclaim gendered slurs and carry the posters they did at the March. She questions whether feminism to allow discriminate and gatekeeping, and this gatekeeping is patriarchy's way of bolstering the binary of purpose vs pleasure, where the feminism of purpose (health, education, marital rights) is 'good' feminism, and the feminism of pleasure (sexual politics, bodily autonomy, agency over time and leisure) is 'bad' feminism, 'immoral' and 'frivolous'. She explains as feminists use the language of real and serious, end up creating a distinction between 'actual' issues and 'pretended' ones and rush to clarify that feminists have included 'important' causes in our demands, end up suggesting that other causes are unimportant.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Khatri |first1=Sadia |title=Should feminists claim Aurat March\u2019s 'vulgar' posters?

That's why the author's compassion is with misogynist politicians\". Referring poster slogan \"Keep your dick pics to yourself.\" Ms. Mohydin says What seems to have affronted the male collective the most is the shattering of a fantasy world where women enjoy being subjected to unrequested pictures of male genitals. Poster slogan has hit them hard. It has upset them. And now, they are angry and trying to speak to us in a language that they think we'll understand. They tell us this is not feminism but fail to explain how. They tell us it's about sex, and as 'respectful' women, how dare we utter of it.<ref name=\"womansxplain\" /> \"When women make demands about their personal lives, their bodies, their sexuality, that's when people feel threatened,\" Dad said. \u201cSo it\u2019s OK to ask the government for the right to education but you can't say you are happily divorced because the breakdown of a matrimony is a shameful thing, a woman\u2019s failure, and you can\u2019t say 'don't send me dick pics' because so-called decent women don't use expressions like dick.\u201d Nobody seems to say anything to the sender, but the reluctant receiver is apparently the problem. Either she likes it (which, to them, makes her a 'slut') or she doesn't (which offends them). So as usual, women cannot win Ms. Mohydin says.

Have protesting women given them performance anxiety or what.<ref name=\"womansxplain\" />\n\nContinuing her strong denunciation Ms. Mohydin says, \"The placards were a mirror and instead of taking this moment as an opportunity to introspect, they have decided to beat their chest instead. Not their slain bodies, not their acid-burnt faces, not their immobility, not their lack of representation, not the dearth of affordable housing, not the moral policing their choices and bodies are subjected to, not the denial of female education, not the constant threat of sexual harassment and onslaught, not the social structures that cut women\u2019s potential in half, not the exploitation, not the objectification, not the fact that for many, women are still not human.

The episodes follow the children's adventures playing in Sunny Patch and learning life lessons, such as being kind to others, being imaginative, having responsibility, and being curious about the world around them.\n\n==Characters==\n===Main===\n* [[Miss Spider]] (voiced by [[Kristin Davis]]) \u2013 Like three of her children, Miss Spider is an adoptee, adopted by Betty Beetle when she could not find her biological mother. Miss Spider tries to be a kind and caring mom and give equal time to all of her many children. She strongly believes that \"We have to be good to bugs; ''all'' bugs.\"\n* Squirt (voiced by Scott Beaudin) \u2013 A curious and adventurous green spider, Squirt is considered to be the leader of the children and as such, more stories center around him than any other. He enjoys surfing the air on his webs, dreams of flying like Shimmer or Dragon, and is often ready to take the lead in an adventure. Because of his impulsive and curious personality, he often needs the advice of his parents to help him with situations.\n* Shimmer (voiced by Rebecca Brenner) \u2013 A pink [[jewel beetle]] with an interest in sports and games, Shimmer is different from the rest of the family as she has abilities the others do not (such as heat sensors). She is one of Miss Spider and Holley's adoptive children.\n* Dragon (voiced by [[Mitchell Eisner]]) \u2013 A purple dragonfly who is one of Miss Spider and Holley's adoptive children. He is the eldest of the Spider children and often assumes the role of an antagonist, especially towards Squirt. In several episodes, Dragon serves as an example of peer pressure. For example, in \"Cry Buggie,\" Dragon pokes fun at Squirt when he explains his feelings.\n* Bounce (voiced by [[Julie Lemieux]]) \u2013 A blue bedbug who is one of Miss Spider and Holley's adoptive children. He is a two-legged, high-energy bug and the only bug character in the series to have teeth. He and Dragon have been \"best bug buddies\" ever since they met because of their similar experiences regarding their original families.\n\n===Supporting===\n* Holley (voiced by [[Robert Norman Smith|Robert Smith]]) \u2013 Miss Spider's husband. Holley is a songwriter who loves to play the guitar. He has a special thinking stone where he makes decisions.\n* Spinner (voiced by Austin Di Iulio in seasons 1-2 and [[Cameron Ansell]] in season 3) \u2013 A yellow spider sporting very large eyeglasses, he looks almost exactly like his father, Holley. He is a smart and wise bug often looked to for advice. While he is not great at physical activities, he has a wonderful talent for the \"bugpipes\".\n* Pansy (voiced by [[Aaryn Doyle]]) and Snowdrop (voiced by Alexandra Lai) - Yellow spiders who are identical twins. Their only distinguishing features are different colored bows on their head; Pansy wears a pink bow, while Snowdrop wears a green bow. Pansy sings well, but not as naturally as Snowdrop.\n* Wiggle (voiced by Marc McMulkin) \u2013 A blue spider who tends to be the worrier of the group, and is quite emotional.\n* Ned (voiced by Jonathon Wilson) and Ted (voiced by Philip Williams) \u2013 A pair of red ant brothers. Ned speaks with an Australian accent and has a tuft of hair between his antenna and Ted speaks with a [[New York dialect|New York accent]]. The both of them are scheming and deceptive and have only two main interests: food and getting more of it. A common running gag is that when one bug mistakes Ted for Ned or vice versa, they would correct the bug by saying \"I'm Ted. He's Ned.\" or vice versa.\n* Stinky (voiced by [[James Cagney]]) \u2013 A green stinkbug who takes up detective work in his free time. He speaks with a New York accent and he is also talented at playing the xylophone.\n* Felix (voiced by Richard Binsley) \u2013 A frog who was introduced in the three-part special \"A Froggy Day in Sunny Patch.\" Felix longed to be a bug himself and refuses to eat bugs, as he does not find them tasty. Instead, he eats only berries.\n* Spiderus Reeves<ref>http://reviews-of-childrens-literature.pbworks.com/w/page/10581702/Miss%20Spider\u2019s%20Wedding</ref>(voiced by [[Tony Jay]]) \u2013 A whiny, conniving, cowardly spider.  He lives with his mate Spindella in a crack at the bottom of the Hollow Tree.\n\n===Recurring===\n* Betty Beetle - Betty is Miss Spider's adoptive mother, the kids' maternal grandmother, and Holley's mother-in-law. It's revealed that when Miss Spider couldn't find her real mom, Betty decided to adopt her.\n* Uncle Asparagus \"Gus\" - (voiced by [[Peter Oldring]]) - A red and green beetle who is Miss Spider's adoptive brother, Betty's son, Holley's brother-in-law, and the kids' maternal uncle. He loves to stargaze with his nephews and nieces.\n*Spindella Reeves - Spiderus's wife who he met in the Snakey Woods near the farm. They have 3 kids named Mandrake, Belladonna, and Poison Ivy.\n* Grub (voiced by [[Rob Tinkler]]) - A white grub that has told Squirt about the Snakey Woods.\n* Whiffy - A light green stinkbug who is Stinky's sister.\n* Grace - A little lost ladybug who is currently with Stinky and Spiffy until her real family comes.\n* Lily - A grown-up ladybug.\n* Eunice Earwig - One of the Spider family's neighbors and the mother of Eddie and Little Sis.\n** Eddie Earwig - Eunice Earwig's son and eldest child. He is good friends with Squirt.\n** Little Sis - Eunice's youngest child and Eddie's younger sister.\n* Mr. Mantis (voiced by [[Wayne Robson]]) - The teacher of the kids' class.\n* Beetrice - A queen bee in a hive part of the hollow tree.\n\n== Episodes ==\n{{Main|List of Miss Spider's Sunny Patch Friends episodes}}\n{{:List of Miss Spider's Sunny Patch Friends episodes}}\n\n==Production==\nThe series was first announced on December 17, 2003, as part of a [[Callaway Arts & Entertainment]] press release.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/miss-spidertm-spins-her-web-far-and-wide-71672177.html|title=Callaway Arts & Entertainment's plans for the Sunny Patch brand|author=Callaway Arts and Entertainment|date=17 December 2003|work=prnewswire.com}}</ref> On March 19 of the same year, it was reported that the show was slated to premiere in January 2004 and that Canadian animation studio [[Nelvana]] was currently producing it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/kristin-davis-lends-her-voice-talents-to-nelvanas-miss-spiders-sunny-patchtm-friends-72138062.html|title=Kristin Davis lends her voice talents to Nelvana's Sunny Patch|author=Nelvana Limited|date=5 January 2004|work=prnewswire.com}}</ref> The series premiered in January 2004 on [[Teletoon]] in Canada and in February 2004 on [[Nickelodeon]] in the United States.\n\nOn June 20, 2005, Nickelodeon ordered a twenty-five-episode second season of the series.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.animationmagazine.net/tv/nick-to-spin-more-miss-spider/|title=Nick to Spin More ''Miss Spider's Sunny Patch Friends''|work=Animation Magazine}}</ref> The second season premiered on March 13, 2006, with the episode \"Captain Sunny Patch.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/nick-jr-premieres-season-two-of-its-hit-3-d-animated-series-miss-spiders-sunny-patch-friendstm-monday-march-13-55333767.html|title=Nick Jr. Premieres Season Two of Its Hit 3-D Animated Series, Miss Spider's Sunny Patch Friends|author=Nick Jr.|date=13 March 2006|work=prnewswire.com}}</ref> A third season followed and Teletoon aired the show's last episode in June 2007.
