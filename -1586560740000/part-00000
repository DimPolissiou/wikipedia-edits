The grille on the 2015 version has a wider chrome surround to it, which touches the headlights at each side. The lower air vents have been enlarged slightly, and the lights themselves have re-profiled LEDs to give the car a more recognisable look in the dark. The wheel arch surrounds and door sills are body coloured on the base model (they used to be black plastic), as is the rear bumper design, which sits below subtly reshaped lower tail light clusters. Also there are new alloy wheel designs to finish off the refresh.\n\nThe changes to the inside are even more difficult to spot than those on the outside. Styling-wise, the only thing of note is a new steering wheel design. There is now the option to specify blind spot and lane departure warning systems if you wish. The boot remains the same volume at 420 litres, expanding to 1,325 litres when the rear seats are folded flat.\n\nAcross the range, each engine has seen an improvement in performance, efficiency or both. The 1.4-litre turbo petrol now features cylinder-on-demand technology, which saves fuel by shutting down a couple of cylinders when less power is needed.\n\nThe 2.0 TFSI petrol units now produce {{convert|180|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|220|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}. The two diesel motors receive boosts of eight and four horsepower, to {{convert|150|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|184|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} respectively. The more performance-oriented RS Q3 gains a sizeable {{convert|30|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} over the old model, and torque now sits at {{convert|332|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}, marginally up from the old version.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.carwow.co.uk/audi/q3|title=New Audi Q3 Review|website=carwow.co.uk|accessdate=10 June 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe vehicle was unveiled in 2014 North American International Auto Show.\n\nUS models went on sale in Fall 2014 as 2015 model year vehicles.

The grille on the 2015 version has a wider chrome surround to it, which touches the headlights at each side. The lower air vents have been enlarged slightly, and the lights themselves have re-profiled LEDs to give the car a more recognisable look in the dark. The wheel arch surrounds and door sills are body coloured on the base model (they used to be black plastic), as is the rear bumper design, which sits below subtly reshaped lower tail light clusters. Also there are new alloy wheel designs to finish off the refresh.\n\nThe changes to the inside are even more difficult to spot than those on the outside. Styling-wise, the only thing of note is a new steering wheel design. There is now the option to specify blind spot and lane departure warning systems if you wish. The boot remains the same volume at 420 litres, expanding to 1,325 litres when the rear seats are folded flat.\n\nAcross the range, each engine has seen an improvement in performance, efficiency or both. The 1.4-litre turbo petrol now features cylinder-on-demand technology, which saves fuel by shutting down a couple of cylinders when less power is needed.\n\nThe 2.0 TFSI petrol units now produce {{convert|180|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|220|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}. The two diesel motors receive boosts of eight and four horsepower, to {{convert|150|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|184|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} respectively. The more performance-oriented RS Q3 gains a sizeable {{convert|30|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} over the old model, and torque now sits at {{convert|332|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}, marginally up from the old version.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.carwow.co.uk/audi/q3|title=New Audi Q3 Review|website=carwow.co.uk|accessdate=10 June 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe vehicle was unveiled in 2014 North American International Auto Show.\n\nUS models went on sale in Fall 2014 as 2015 model year vehicles.

In Europe, the Sportback will gain a new base 1.5L hybrid turbo four for the 2020 model year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a28492873/2020-audi-q3-sportback-photos-info/|title=The 2020 Audi Q3 Sportback Offers More Style with Less Space|work=[[Car and Driver]]|last=Golson|first=Daniel|date=24 July 2019|accessdate=25 July 2019}}</ref> The RS Q3 variant was also revealed in September 2019; it has the same engine as the first-generation RS Q3 albeit with more power.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a29245599/audi-rs-q3-photos-info/|title=Audi RS Q3 Is Back with Ferocious Five-Cylinder Power|work=[[Car and Driver]]|last=Capparella|first=Joey|date=26 September 2019|accessdate=26 September 2019}}</ref>\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"150px\">\nFile:2019 Audi Q3 S Line 35 TDi S-A 2.0 Rear.jpg|Rear\nFile:2019 Audi Q3 TFSi 35 Interior.jpg|Interior\nFile:Audi RS Q3 F3 IMG 2069.jpg|RS Q3\nFile:2019 Audi Q3 Sportback Rear.jpg|Q3 Sportback\nFile:2019 Audi RS Q3 Sportback Rear.jpg|RS Q3 Sportback\n</gallery>\n\n===Safety===\n{{Euro NCAP |year=2019 |overall_stars=5 |description=Audi Q3 |reference={{cite \nweb|url=https://www.euroncap.com/en/results/audi/q3/34189|title=Official Audi Q3 safety rating|accessdate=27 February 2019}} |adult_points=36.2 |adult_percent=95 |child_points=42.5 |child_percent=86 |pedestrian_points=36.7 |pedestrian_percent=76 |safety_points=11.1 |safety_percent=85 }}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n===Notes===\n* Stein, Jason, [http://www.autoweek.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060206/FREE/60203007/1041 ''Audi to build Q5 SUV, Q3 may be next''], ''[[AutoWeek]]'', February 3, 2006 (URL last accessed October 18, 2006).\n* [http://www.channel4.com/4car/feature/feature.jsp?id=157 ''Future Models (2009)''], [[Channel 4|Channel 4 News (UK)]], July 14, 2006 (URL last accessed October 18, 2006).\n* [http://www.automobilemag.com/features/news/0609_2011_audi_q3/ 2011 ''Audi Q3''], ''[[Automobile Magazine]]'', November 1, 2006 (URL last accessed October 18, 2006).\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Audi Q3}}\n* [http://www.audi.com Audi corporate website]\n\n{{Audi}}\n{{Audi (Europe) timeline 1970 to date}}\n{{Modern North American Audi vehicles}}\n\n[[Category:Audi vehicles|Q3]]\n[[Category:Crossover sport utility vehicles]]\n[[Category:Compact sport utility vehicles]]\n[[Category:Luxury crossover sport utility vehicles]]\n[[Category:Luxury sport utility vehicles]]\n[[Category:All-wheel-drive vehicles]]\n[[Category:Cars introduced in 2011]]\n[[Category:2010s cars]]\n", "name_user": "TKOIII", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eExternal links:cats", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audi_Q3"}

By 2006, Costello has groomed him as a mole inside the [[Massachusetts State Police]] (MSP). Sullivan is accepted into its Special Investigations Unit, which targets organized crime. Before graduating from the MSP's academy, William \"Billy\" Costigan Jr. is recruited by Captain Queenan and Staff Sergeant Dignam to go undercover, as his family's ties to organized crime make him a perfect infiltrator. His cover story is that he is an MSP academy dropout who served time in prison on an assault charge; he subsequently joins Costello's crew.\n\nSullivan begins a romance with police psychiatrist Madolyn Madden. Costigan also sees her as a condition of his probation, and they begin a relationship as well. After Costello escapes a sting operation, each mole becomes aware of the other's existence. Sullivan is promoted to the State Police's Internal Investigations unit and tasked by Costello to find the rat. Costigan follows Costello into a porn theater, where Costello gives Sullivan an envelope containing personal information on his crew members. Costigan chases Sullivan through [[Chinatown, Boston|Chinatown]], but neither man sees the other's face.\n\nSullivan later has Queenan tailed to a meeting with Costigan on the roof of an empty building. Costello's men arrive, and Queenan makes Costigan leave to preserve his cover before confronting them alone. They drop Queenan to his death before engaging in a brief shootout with police. Crew member Delahunt subsequently dies from a gunshot wound, after telling Costigan he knew he was the informant. Television news states that Delahunt had been an undercover cop, but Costello recognizes this as a ploy to protect the real informant. With Queenan dead a furious Dignam is ordered to take a leave of absence after a fight with Sullivan, but he resigns instead.\n\nUsing Queenan's phone, Sullivan reaches Costigan, who refuses to abort his mission. Sullivan learns from Queenan's diary that Costello is a protected FBI informant, causing him to worry about his own identity being revealed (meanwhile, Costigan also learns Costello is an FBI informant from a bank robber he is sent to brutalise). With Costigan's help, Costello is traced to a cocaine drop-off, where a gunfight erupts between the crew and the police. Most of the crew are killed. Costello, confronted by Sullivan, admits he is an FBI informant, and Sullivan kills him.\n\nWith the operation wrapped up Costigan goes to Sullivan to restore his true identity, but he notices the envelope from Costello on Sullivan's desk, realizes he's Costello's mole and flees. Recognizing Costigan's revelation, Sullivan erases Costigan's records from the police computer system. Costigan forwards Madolyn's recordings, which Costello willed to him, of confidential conversations incriminating Sullivan as a mole, prompting her to abandon Sullivan.\n\nCostigan arranges to meet Sullivan at the building where Queenan died, where he holds him at gunpoint. Trooper Brown, a friend of Costigan's from the academy, also arrives at his behest, but he has not brought Dignam as requested and instead treats him with suspicion. Trooper Barrigan from Special Investigations arrives and kills both Costigan and Brown, revealing that he was a second mole for Costello. Sullivan then kills Barrigan and frames him as the only mole.\n\nAt Costigan's funeral, Sullivan notices that Madolyn is tearful. She ignores him when he attempts to speak to her. Later, Sullivan arrives home to his apartment and is confronted by Dignam, who kills him. As he leaves, a rat races across the balcony.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{div col}}\n<!-- Cast is in credits order and named as credited; please do not change. -->\n* [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] as William \"Billy\" Costigan\n* [[Matt Damon]] as Colin Sullivan\n** Conor Donovan as young Colin\n* [[Jack Nicholson]] as Francis \"Frank\" Costello\n* [[Mark Wahlberg]] as Sgt.

Sullivan addresses Costello as \"Dad\" whenever he calls to inform him of police activities.\n\nIn the final scene, a rat is seen on Sullivan's window ledge. Scorsese acknowledges that while it is not meant to be taken literally, it somewhat symbolizes the \"quest for the rat\" in the film and the strong sense of distrust among the characters, much like post-[[September 11 attacks|9/11]] U.S. The window view behind the rat is a nod to gangster films like ''[[Little Caesar (film)|Little Caesar]]'' (1931), ''[[Scarface (1932 film)|Scarface]]'' (1932), and ''[[White Heat]]'' (1949).<ref name=\"scor\">{{cite news |url=http://www.canmag.com/news/4/3/5292 |title=Martin Scorsese Talks ''The Departed'' Rat |work=Canmag |date=October 5, 2006 |accessdate=February 25, 2013 |author=Topel, Fred|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111101000549/http://canmag.com/news/4/3/5292|archive-date=November 1, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n<!--Note: an earlier version of this article had a section on homages that was deleted on 2007-02-26 as being unsourced.

By 2006, Costello has groomed him as a mole inside the [[Massachusetts State Police]] (MSP). Sullivan is accepted into its Special Investigations Unit, which targets organized crime. Before graduating from the MSP's academy, William \"Billy\" Costigan Jr. is recruited by Captain Queenan and Staff Sergeant Dignam to go undercover, as his family's ties to organized crime make him a perfect infiltrator. His cover story is that he is an MSP academy dropout who served time in prison on an assault charge; he subsequently joins Costello's crew.\n\nSullivan begins a romance with police psychiatrist Madolyn Madden. Costigan also sees her as a condition of his probation, and they begin a relationship as well. After Costello escapes a sting operation, each mole becomes aware of the other's existence. Sullivan is promoted to the State Police's Internal Investigations unit and tasked with finding the rat. Costigan follows Costello into a porn theater, where Costello gives Sullivan an envelope containing personal information on his crew members. Costigan chases Sullivan through [[Chinatown, Boston|Chinatown]], but neither man sees the other's face.\n\nSullivan later has Queenan tailed to a meeting with Costigan on the roof of an empty building. Costello's men arrive, and Queenan makes Costigan leave to preserve his cover before confronting them alone. They drop Queenan to his death before engaging in a brief shootout with police. Crew member Delahunt subsequently dies from a gunshot wound, after telling Costigan he knew he was the informant. Television news states that Delahunt had been an undercover cop, but Costello recognizes this as a ploy to protect the real informant. With Queenan dead, a furious Dignam is ordered to take a leave of absence after a fight with Sullivan, but he resigns instead.\n\nUsing Queenan's phone, Sullivan reaches Costigan, who refuses to abort his mission. Sullivan learns from Queenan's diary that Costello is a protected FBI informant, causing him to worry about his own identity being revealed (meanwhile, Costigan also learns Costello is an FBI informant from a bank robber he is sent to brutalise). With Costigan's help, Costello is traced to a cocaine drop-off, where a gunfight erupts between the crew and the police. Most of the crew are killed. Costello, confronted by Sullivan, admits he is an FBI informant, and Sullivan kills him.\n\nWith the operation wrapped up, Costigan goes to Sullivan to restore his true identity, but he notices the envelope from Costello on Sullivan's desk, realizes he's Costello's mole and flees. Recognizing Costigan's revelation, Sullivan erases his records from the police computer system. Costigan forwards Madolyn recordings, which Costello willed to him of confidential conversations incriminating Sullivan as a mole, prompting her to abandon Sullivan.\n\nCostigan arranges to meet Sullivan at the building where Queenan died, where he holds him at gunpoint. Trooper Brown, a friend of Costigan's from the academy, also arrives at his behest, but he has not brought Dignam as requested and instead treats him with suspicion. Trooper Barrigan from Special Investigations arrives and kills both Costigan and Brown, revealing that he was a second mole for Costello. Sullivan then kills Barrigan and frames him as the only mole.\n\nAt Costigan's funeral, Sullivan notices that Madolyn is tearful. She ignores him when he attempts to speak to her. Later, Sullivan arrives home to his apartment and is confronted by Dignam, who kills him. As he leaves, a rat races across the balcony.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{div col}}\n<!-- Cast is in credits order and named as credited; please do not change. -->\n* [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] as William \"Billy\" Costigan\n* [[Matt Damon]] as Colin Sullivan\n** Conor Donovan as young Colin\n* [[Jack Nicholson]] as Francis \"Frank\" Costello\n* [[Mark Wahlberg]] as Sgt.

Sullivan addresses Costello as \"Dad\" whenever he calls to inform him of police activities.\n\nIn the final scene, a rat is seen on Sullivan's window ledge. Scorsese acknowledges that while it is not meant to be taken literally, it somewhat symbolizes the \"quest for the rat\" in the film and the strong sense of distrust among the characters, much like post-[[September 11 attacks|9/11]] U.S. The window view behind the rat is a nod to gangster films like ''[[Little Caesar (film)|Little Caesar]]'' (1931), ''[[Scarface (1932 film)|Scarface]]'' (1932), and ''[[White Heat]]'' (1949).<ref name=\"scor\">{{cite news |url=http://www.canmag.com/news/4/3/5292 |title=Martin Scorsese Talks ''The Departed'' Rat |work=Canmag |date=October 5, 2006 |accessdate=February 25, 2013 |author=Topel, Fred|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111101000549/http://canmag.com/news/4/3/5292|archive-date=November 1, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n<!--Note: an earlier version of this article had a section on homages that was deleted on 2007-02-26 as being unsourced.
