{"title_page": "Deaths in 2020", "text_new": "{{pp-vandalism|small=yes}}\n{{Short description|List of notable individuals who died in 2020}}\nThe following deaths of notable individuals occurred in 2020. Names are reported under the date of death, in alphabetical order by surname or pseudonym.\n\nA typical entry reports information in the following sequence:\n\n* Name, age, country of citizenship at birth, subsequent [[nationality]] (if applicable), what subject was noted for, cause of death (if known), and reference.\n\n<!--\n* * * * * * * Please adhere to the guidelines below when adding a name to this article. * * * * * * *\n\nA typical entry reports information in the following sequence: Name, age, country of citizenship at birth or nationality if the subject is not eligible (for example, in the case of animals), subsequent nationality (if applicable), what subject was noted for, cause of death (if known), and reference. Do not place a period at the end of the entry. Names are reported under the date of death. Names under each date are reported in alphabetical order by surname or pseudonym.\n\n(1) Please add only those meeting Wikipedia notability guidelines. Include a reference to a reliable source.[a] [b] If a Wikipedia article for the dead does not yet exist, reconsider whether the subject is actually notable. If so, consider writing an article yourself. Those without a Wikipedia article are removed after one month.\n\n(2) Please understand that the intent of this article is to report notable deaths. Tragic deaths, while unfortunate, do not necessarily render the dead \"notable\". If you report the death of a notable subject that does not already have a Wikipedia article, consider starting one. Include third-party sources other than the obituary.\n\n(3) Please add entries in alphabetical order by family name. Please avoid over-linking. As such, please do not add links to nationalities, common occupations, or common causes of death. Rather, include only \"links that aid navigation and understanding\". Thank you.\n\n(4) References should be in <ref>[url & title]</ref> format, as full citations make the page too slow to load, and too big to edit.\n\n--Notes--\n[a] See [[WP:RS]] for definition of reliable source, and [[WP:BLPSOURCE]] for living and recently deceased persons.\n[b] For information on using information from Ancestry.com, Find-a-grave, or IMDb, please see [[WP:ELPEREN]].\n* * * *

Include a reference to a reliable source.[a] [b] If a Wikipedia article for the dead does not yet exist, reconsider whether the subject is actually notable. If so, consider writing an article yourself. Those without a Wikipedia article are removed after one month.\n\n(2) Please understand that the intent of this article is to report notable deaths.

Include third-party sources other than the obituary.\n\n(3) Please add entries in alphabetical order by family name. Please avoid over-linking. As such, please do not add links to nationalities, common occupations, or common causes of death. Rather, include only \"links that aid navigation and understanding\". Thank you.\n\n(4) References should be in <ref>[url & title]</ref> format, as full citations make the page too slow to load, and too big to edit.\n\n--Notes--\n[a] See [[WP:RS]] for definition of

[See vol. iii. p. 479.] The ornament itself dates from about the end of the i6th century, but it received the name of Trill at a somewhat later date, not to be exactly ascertained.

Whether a trill is played in this way or not is largely a matter of taste.\n\nThe number of alternations between notes can vary according to the length of the note in question. At slower [[tempo]]s a note will last longer, meaning more notes can be played in the trill, but with a fast tempo and short note a trill might be reduced to nothing more than the indicated note, the note above and the indicated note again.\n\nTrills may also be played beginning on the note above the one indicated (the ''auxiliary note''). Additionally, a trill is often ended by playing the note ''below'' the one indicated followed by the note itself.\n\n== In specific styles ==\n[[Image:Baroque Trill Instructions.svg|thumb|A table depicting how to perform different types of trills when playing music from the [[Baroque music|Baroque]] period (1600\u20131750).<ref name=\"bachspf\">Taylor, Franklin.

For those who do not like cadences, sequences, and cadential trills, baroque music is not the scene.|[[Robert Donington]], ''Baroque Music, Style and Performance''<ref name=\"Donington\"/>}}\n\nIn the [[Baroque music|baroque period]], a number of signs indicating specific patterns with which a trill should be begun or ended were used. In the ''[[Klavierb\u00fcchlein f\u00fcr Wilhelm Friedemann Bach]]'', [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] lists a number of these signs together with the correct way to interpret them. Unless one of these specific signs is indicated, the details of how to play the trill are up to the performer. In general, however, trills in this era are executed beginning on the auxiliary note, before the written note, often producing the effect of a harmonic [[suspension (music)|suspension]] which resolves to the principal note. But, if the note preceding the ornamented note is itself one scale degree above the principal note, then the dissonant note has already been stated, and the trill typically starts on the principal note.\n\nSeveral trill symbols and techniques common in the Baroque and early Classical era have fallen entirely out of use, including for instance the brief ''Pralltriller'', represented by a very brief wavy line, referred to by [[Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach]] in his ''Essay on the True Art of Playing Keyboard Instruments'' (''Versuch'') (1753\u20131762).\n\nBeyond the baroque era, specific signs for ornamentation are very rare. Continuing through the time of Mozart, the default expectations for the interpretation of trills continued to be similar to those of the baroque. In music after the time of Mozart, the trill usually begins on the principal note.\n\nAll of these are only rules of thumb, and, together with the overall rate of the trill and whether that rate is constant or variable, can only be determined by considering the context in which the trill appears, and is usually to a large degree a matter of opinion with no single \"right\" way of executing the ornament.\n\n== On specific instruments ==\n\n{{listen |\n  | filename = Bassoon-technical-trills.ogg\n  | title = Bassoon trills\n  | description = A [[bassoon]] playing several trills.\n|}}\nThe trill is frequently found in classical music for all instruments, although it is more easily executed on some than others. For example, while it is relatively easy to produce a trill on the [[flute]], the proper execution on [[brass instruments]] requires higher skill and is produced by quickly alternating partials. While playing a trill on the piano the pianist may find that it becomes increasingly difficult to execute a trill including the weak fingers of the hand (3, 4 and 5), with a trill consisting of 4 and 5 being the hardest. On the [[guitar]], a trill is a series of [[hammer-on]]s and [[pull-off]]s (generally executed using just the fingers of the fretting hand but can use both hands). Trill keys are used to rapidly alternate between a note and an adjacent note often in another register on [[woodwind instrument]]s. On the bowed instruments, the violin and the viola in particular, the trill is relatively easy to execute, with a straightforward bowing and the trill involving the oscillation of just one finger against the main note which is stopped by the finger behind, or more rarely, the open string.\n\n=== On brass instruments ===\nTrills may be performed on valveless [[brass instrument]]s by rapidly [[Slur (music)|slur]]ring between two adjacent notes by means of the [[embouchure]] \u2013 this is colloquially known as a \"lip trill.\" This was a common practice on the [[natural trumpet]]s and [[natural horn]]s of the [[Baroque Music|Baroque]]/[[European classical music|Classical]] era. However the lip trill is often still used in the modern [[French horn]] in places where the [[Harmonic series (music)|harmonics]] are only a [[Major second|tone]] apart (though this can be difficult for inexperienced players). Such trills are also a stylistic feature of [[jazz]] music, particularly in trumpet parts.\n\n=== Vocal trills ===\nVocal music of the classical tradition has included a variety of ornaments known as trills since the time of [[Giulio Caccini]]. In the preface to his [[Le nuove musiche]], he describes both the \"shake\" (what is commonly known today as the trill) and the \"trill\" (now often called a Baroque or Monteverdi trill). However, by the time of the Italian [[bel canto]] composers such as [[Gioachino Rossini|Rossini]], [[Gaetano Donizetti|Donizetti]] and [[Vincenzo Bellini|Bellini]], the rapid alternation between two notes that Caccini describes as a shake was known as a trill and was preferred.\n\nColoratura singers, particularly the high-voiced sopranos and tenors, are frequently required to trill not only in the works of these composers but in much of their repertoire. Soprano [[Joan Sutherland|Dame Joan Sutherland]] was particularly famed for the evenness and rapidity of her trill, and stated in interview that she \"never really had to learn how to trill\".<ref>{{youtube|XMWiQG2RuoY|Interview with Dame Joan Sutherland and Richard Bonynge<!--|accessdate=22 September 2011-->}}.</ref>  The trill is usually a feature of an ornamented solo line, but choral or chorus trills do appear.\n\nDespite the trill being written in many works for voice, a singer with an even, rapid trill is a rarity. Opinion is divided as to if and how well a trill can be taught or learnt, though mezzo-soprano [[Marilyn Horne]] frequently stated that she gained her trill by a commonly taught exercise, alternating between two notes, starting slowly and increasing velocity over time.<ref>{{youtube|NKRdpm2RfHU|Interview with Dame Joan Sutherland and Marilyn Horne<!--|accessdate=22 September 2011-->}}.</ref> The director of the [[Rossini Opera Festival]], [[Alberto Zedda]] has opined in interview that the \"widespread technical deficiency\",<ref>{{cite web |last=Hastings |first=Stephen |title=Taking the Pulse of Pesaro |url=http://www.operanews.com/operanews/templates/content.aspx?id=19997 |work=OPERA NEWS |accessdate=22 September 2011}}</ref> the inability to trill, is a source of \"frustration and anguish\". In fact, whole performances and recordings, especially of bel canto works, have been judged based on performance\u2014or lack thereof\u2014of trills, especially trills written ''in the score'' as opposed to trills in a cadenza or variation.\n\n==Trillo==\n\nThe word ''trillo'' is sometimes used to mean the same as trill. However, in [[early music]] some refer to a related ornament specifically called ''trillo'':\n\n{{quote|Trillo is the least familiar of the vocal maneuvers, and, in present day usage, is performed either on a single note or as a technique for executing rapid scale-like passages.

The record low is 7 Celsius (44.6 F). Arusha averages 29.8 days per year above 32 Celsius (89.6 F) \u2013 all between November and March. Arusha's annual precipitation average is 123&nbsp;cm (48.7 inches), mostly coming during the long rainy season from March to May. Areas immediately to the north and northeast of Arusha can see more precipitation and cooler temperatures due to the influence of Mt. Meru, whose rain shadow extends toward the southeast side of the mountain.\n\nArusha and the northern highlands of Tanzania experience a bimodal rainfall pattern, with two rainy seasons. Many crops are planted twice per year. The long \"masika\" rains from March through May are more reliable in Arusha than in surrounding areas because of the influence of Mt. Meru. The short \"vuli\" rains are less reliable, usually coming in November and December.  The dry \"kiangazi\" season is June to October. Higher elevation areas north and northeast of the city are home to farmers growing bananas, coffee, cabbage, potatoes, carrots, leafy greens, and other vegetables. Cultivation in areas to the northwest, west, southwest, south, and southeast focuses on maize, beans and wheat. There is a significant horticulture industry, with several companies growing flowers for export to Europe.\n\n==Sports==\n[[File:Sheikh Amri Abeid Memorial Stadium.jpg|thumb|The [[Sheikh Amri Abeid Memorial Stadium]]]]\nThe city is home to the Tanzanian rugby [[Tanzania national rugby union team|national team]].

The record low is 7 Celsius (44.6 F). Arusha averages 29.8 days per year above 32 Celsius (89.6 F) \u2013 all between November and March. Arusha's annual precipitation average is 123&nbsp;cm (48.7 inches), mostly coming during the long rainy season from March to May. Areas immediately to the north and northeast of Arusha can see more precipitation and cooler temperatures due to the influence of Mt. Meru, whose rain shadow extends toward the southeast side of the mountain.\n\nArusha and the northern highlands of Tanzania experience a bimodal rainfall pattern, with two rainy seasons. Many crops are planted twice per year. The long \"masika\" rains from March through May are more reliable in Arusha than in surrounding areas because of the influence of Mt. Meru. The short \"vuli\" rains are less reliable, usually coming in November and December.  The dry \"kiangazi\" season is June to October. Higher elevation areas north and northeast of the city are home to farmers growing bananas, coffee, cabbage, potatoes, carrots, leafy greens, and other vegetables. Cultivation in areas to the northwest, west, southwest, south, and southeast focuses on maize, beans and wheat.

Leaving behind an important cultural legacy, he is considered one of the greatest playwrights in [[Romanian language]] and [[Literature of Romania|literature]], as well as one of its most important writers and a leading representative of [[Romanian humor|local humour]]. Alongside [[Mihai Eminescu]], [[Ioan Slavici]] and [[Ion Creang\u0103]], he is seen as one of the main representatives of ''[[Junimea]]'', an influential literary society with which he nonetheless parted during the second half of his life. His work, spanning four decades, covers the ground between [[Neoclassicism]], [[Realism (arts)|Realism]], and [[Naturalism (literature)|Naturalism]], building on an original synthesis of foreign and local influences.\n\nAlthough few in number, Caragiale's plays constitute the most accomplished expression of [[Theatre of Romania|Romanian theater]], as well as being important venues for criticism of late-19th-century Romanian society. They include the [[Comedy|comedies]] ''[[O noapte furtunoas\u0103]]'', ''[[Conu Leonida fa\u0163\u0103 cu reac\u0163iunea]]'', ''[[O scrisoare pierdut\u0103]]'', and the [[tragedy]] ''[[N\u0103pasta]]''. In addition to these, Caragiale authored the [[melodrama]] ''[[O soacr\u0103]]'', a large number of essays, articles, short stories, [[novella]]s and [[Sketch story|sketch stories]], as well as occasional works of poetry and autobiographical texts such as ''[[Din carnetul unui vechi sufleur]]''. In many cases, his creations were first published in one of several magazines he edited\u2014''[[Claponul]]'', ''[[Moftul Rom\u00e2n]]'', ''[[Vatra (literary magazine)|Vatra]]'' and ''[[Epoca (Romania)|Epoca]]''. Most of his prose works have been published under the title ''[[Momente \u015fi schi\u0163e]]'': they include ''[[C\u0103ldur\u0103 mare]]'', ''[[C\u0103nu\u0163\u0103 om sucit]]'', ''[[Dou\u0103 loturi]]'', ''[[Grand Hotel \"Victoria rom\u00e2n\u0103\"]]'', as well as several pieces referring to [[stock character]]s such as [[Lache and Mache]], [[Marius Chico\u015f Rostogan]] and [[Mitic\u0103]]. In some of his later fiction writings, including ''[[La hanul lui M\u00e2njoal\u0103]]'', ''[[Kir Ianulea]]'', ''[[Abu-Hasan]]'', ''[[Pastram\u0103 trufanda]]'' and ''[[Calul dracului]]'', Caragiale adopted the [[Fantasy literature|fantasy]] genre or turned to [[historical fiction]].\n\nIon Luca Caragiale was interested in the politics of the [[Kingdom of Romania|Romanian Kingdom]], and oscillated between the [[Liberalism and radicalism in Romania|liberal current]] and [[conservatism]]. Most of his [[Satire|satirical]] works target the liberal [[Republicanism|republicans]] and the [[National Liberal Party (Romania, 1875)|National Liberals]], evidencing both his respect for their rivals at ''Junimea'' and his connections with the literary critic [[Titu Maiorescu]]. He came to clash with National Liberal leaders such as [[Dimitrie Sturdza]] and [[Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu]], and was a lifelong adversary of the [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist]] poet [[Alexandru Macedonski]]. As a result of these conflicts, the most prominent of [[Criticism of Ion Luca Caragiale|Caragiale's critics]] barred his access to the cultural establishment for several decades. During the 1890s, Caragiale rallied with the [[Radicalism (historical)|radical]] movement of [[George Panu]], before associating with the [[Conservative Party (Romania, 1880\u20131918)|Conservative Party]]. After having decided to settle in [[Berlin]], he came to voice strong criticism for Romanian politicians of all colours in the wake of the [[1907 Romanian Peasants' Revolt]], and ultimately joined the [[Conservative-Democratic Party]].\n\nHe was both a friend and rival to writers such as Eminescu, Maiorescu, and [[Barbu \u015etef\u0103nescu Delavrancea]], while maintaining contacts with, among others, the ''Junimist'' essayist [[Iacob Negruzzi]], the [[Socialism|socialist]] philosopher [[Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea]], the literary critic [[Paul Zarifopol]], the poets [[George Co\u015fbuc]] and [[Mite Kremnitz]], the psychologist [[Constantin R\u0103dulescu-Motru]], and the [[Transylvania]]n poet and activist [[Octavian Goga]]. Ion Luca was the nephew of [[Costache Caragiale|Costache]] and [[Iorgu Caragiale]], who were major figures of mid-19th century Romanian theatre.

He published relatively few articles under various [[pen name]]s\u2014among them ''Car.'', the contraction of his family name, and the more elaborate ''Palicar''.<ref>Cioculescu, p.60</ref> He mostly performed basic services for the editorial staff and its [[printing press]], given that, after Luca Caragiali died in 1870, he was the sole provider for his mother and sister.<ref>Cioculescu, p.18, 60; M\u00eendra, p.9</ref> Following his return to Bucharest, he became even more involved with the [[Radicalism (historical)|radical]] and republican wing of the liberal trend\u2014a movement commonly referred to as \"the Reds\". As he later confessed, he frequently attended its congresses, witnessing the speeches held by Reds leader [[C. A.

That is why the success of the [1890 Eminescu edition] has overcome all the editors' expectations\".<ref>Perpessicius, p.138</ref> He also reprinted his recollections from the world of theater, alongside pieces originally published in ''[[Claponul]]'' and various new satirical pieces.<ref name=\"zarifintrod\"/>\n\nAlthough this attack owed much to ''Junimea'''s discourse, Caragiale had by then turned against Maiorescu, probably due to his perception that the society had failed to support his cause at the Academy.<ref>Vianu, Vol. II, p.182-183</ref> In May 1892, he used a public conference at the [[Romanian Athenaeum]] as a venue to make known his claims against the former Minister of Education and his associates, which caused a definitive rift between the two public figures.<ref>Cioculescu, p.21; M\u00eendra, p.274; Ornea, p.200; Vianu, Vol. II, p.183</ref> Caragiale also wrote ''Dou\u0103 note'' (\"Two Notes\"), an article accusing Maiorescu of having modified and censored some of Eminescu's poems, and of having exploited the poet for financial gain.<ref>Ornea, p.200; Vianu, Vol. II, p.183</ref> Around that time, he ceased contributing to ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]''.<ref name=\"Ornea, p.200\"/>\n\nLate in 1892, Caragiale published two volumes of prose, including his new [[novella]]s ''[[P\u0103cat]]'', ''[[O f\u0103clie de Pa\u015fte]]'' and ''[[Om cu noroc]]''.<ref name=\"Vianu, Vol. II, p.183\">Vianu, Vol. II, p.183</ref> The following year, he began frequenting [[Socialism|socialist]] circles as an outsider to the cause, and soon became good friends with the [[Russian Empire|Imperial Russian]]-born [[Marxism|Marxist]] thinker [[Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea]].<ref>Cioculescu, p.22; Vianu, Vol. II, p.183, 184</ref> Financial constraints forced Caragiale to become an entrepreneur, and, in November of that year, opened a [[beer garden]] near [[Gabroveni Inn]], in Bucharest's [[Lipscani]] area.<ref name=\"enemagist\"/><ref name=\"adevcasele\"/><ref name=\"M\u00eendra, p p.184\">M\u00eendra, p.274;

Ciupal\u0103, p.104-105</ref> The writer placed the blame for Odobescu's death on his much younger lover, Hortensia Racovi\u0163\u0103, and hailed his wife, Sa\u015fa Odobescu, as a model of devoted womanhood.<ref>Ciupal\u0103, p.104-105</ref>\n\nThis episode of his life coincided with a period when relations between Romania and [[Austria-Hungary]] were extremely tense. Three years before, [[Romanians|ethnic Romanian]] leaders in Austro-Hungarian-ruled Transylvania had signed the ''[[Transylvanian Memorandum]]'', which inflamed passions among the Hungarians and led the authors to be indicted. [[Conservative Party (Romania, 1880\u20131918)|Conservative Party]] politicians in Romania had succeeded in negotiating an [[amnesty]], but their policies were overturned by the National Liberals, who appealed to nationalist and [[Irredentism|irredentist]] sentiment.\n\nThus, Sturdza offered a measure of support to [[Eugen Brote]], ''[[Tribuna (Romania)|Tribuna]]'' editor and [[National Romanian Party]] activist. Brote, who fled Transylvania and planned to directly implicate the [[Kingdom of Romania|Romanian Kingdom]] into the conflict, attempted to replace the pro-Conservative leadership of the National Party with a selection of politicians favored by the National Liberals.<ref name=\"Cioculescu, p.24\">Cioculescu, p.24</ref> As Sturdza came to lead the cabinet, both he and Brote retracted their previous statements, but again provoked the National Party by alleging that its leaders were the actual radicals.<ref name=\"Cioculescu, p.24\"/> In harsh terms, Caragiale exposed the understanding Sturdza had with Brote.<ref>Cioculescu, p.24-25; Vianu, Vol. II, p.185</ref> Soon after, he authored a short story about a con artist who traveled to the imagined Transylvanian town of Opidul-nou, posing as the nationalist Romanian writer [[Alexandru Vlahu\u0163\u0103]] as a means to live off the local [[intelligentsia]].<ref>Cioculescu, p.126; Vianu, Vol. II, p.187</ref> In October 1897, he was outraged by news that Sturdza had given in to Austro-Hungarian demands, and that he had expelled Transylvanian nationalists from Romania: Caragiale held a speech in which he argued that Romanians living abroad were \"indispensable\" to the Romanian state.<ref>Cioculescu, p.125-126</ref>\n\n===''Epoca''===\n[[File:Const Jiquidi - Caragiale leaving Epoca.jpg|thumb|Caragiale as a traveler, parting with ''[[Epoca (Romania)|Epoca]]'' (1890s caricature by [[Constantin Jiquidi]])]]\nIn 1895, the writer followed the Radical group into its unusual merger with the Conservative Party.<ref>Cioculescu, p.25-26;

its title, ''O lichea'' (roughly: \"A Scoundrel\"), was reluctantly accepted by ''Epoca'', and only after Caragiale claimed that it reflected the original meaning of the word ''lichea'' (\"stain\"), explaining that it referred to Sturdza's unusual persistence in politics.<ref>Cioculescu, p.27</ref>\n\nWhen answering to one of ''Epoca'''s inquiries, he showed that he had yet again come to reevaluate ''Junimea'', and found it to be an essential institution in Romanian culture.<ref name=\"Vianu, Vol. II, p.186\"/> Nevertheless, he was distancing himself from the purest ''Junimist'' tenets, and took a favorable view of [[Romanticism|Romantic]] writers whom the society had criticized or ridiculed\u2014among these, he indicated his personal rival [[Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu]], whom he acknowledged to be among \"the most remarkable figures of our literature\", and [[Alexandru Odobescu]].<ref name=\"Vianu, Vol. II, p.186\"/> As editor of ''Epoca'', he published works by Hasdeu alongside those of his other contemporaries and predecessors\u2014[[Grigore Alexandrescu]], [[Nicolae Filimon]], [[Dinicu Golescu]], [[Ion Heliade R\u0103dulescu]], [[Cilibi Moise]], [[Costache Negruzzi]], and [[Anton Pann]].<ref>Cazimir (1967), p.63, 84\u201385</ref> He also took a more sympathetic but still distant view of Maiorescu.<ref name=\"Vianu, Vol. II, p.186\"/> At the time, he befriended the young poet [[Cincinat Pavelescu]], and helped to promote his works in the press.<ref name=\"cpavelescu\">{{in lang|ro}} [[Cincinat Pavelescu]], [http://ro.wikisource.org/wiki/Amintiri_literare_%28Ion_Luca_Caragiale%29 ''Amintiri literare (Ion Luca Caragiale)''] (wikisource)</ref>\n\n===''Universul''===\nAround that time, Caragiale began collaborating with the formerly ''Junimist'' figure [[Mihail Dragomirescu]], who enlisted his anonymous contributions to the magazine ''[[Convorbiri Critice]]''.<ref>Cioculescu, p.93, 293\u2013311</ref> Again pressed by financial problems, he returned to a bureaucratic post\u2014this time with the administration of [[Government monopoly|government monopolies]], and appointed by the Conservative cabinet of [[Gheorghe Grigore Cantacuzino]] in June 1899.<ref name=\"enemagist\"/><ref>Cioculescu, p.10;

he noted that, while the commerce was dominated by foreigners, the administration was gripped by a no longer aristocratic [[oligarchy]] and its far-reaching [[political machine]].<ref>Cioculescu, p.28-29, 121, 123, 268\u2013271; Vianu, Vol. II, p.189-190</ref> As several commentators noted, many of the topics brought up by Caragiale built on the critical overview adopted by ''Junimea''.<ref>Ornea, p.228; Vianu, Vol. II, p.190</ref> To the social and political problems, the text offered a [[Monarchism|monarchist]] solution\u2014Caragiale expected Carol I to carry out a ''[[coup d'\u00e9tat]]'' against the Romanian political establishment, replacing the [[1866 Constitution of Romania|Constitution of 1866]], which left some room for [[Privilege (legal ethics)|privilege]] through the [[census suffrage]], with a more [[Democracy|democratic]] one.<ref>Cioculescu, p.301;

Vianu, Vol. II, p.191</ref> Caragiale rejected the offer: by then, he had grown disillusioned with the traditional political groupings, and had decided to sever all his links with them.<ref>Cioculescu, p.27-28, 29\u201330; Vianu, Vol. II, p.191</ref> Instead, in 1908, he joined the [[Conservative-Democratic Party]], a rising force of the entrepreneurial [[middle class]], led by [[Take Ionescu]].<ref>Cioculescu, p.29-30, 271\u2013273; Ornea, p.208; Vianu, Vol. II, p.191</ref> He briefly returned to Romania several times after 1908, campaigning in favor of the Ionescu and being himself proposed for a seat in the [[Chamber of Deputies of Romania|Chamber of Deputies]] (before the Conservative-Democrats decided another person was more suited for the position).<ref>Cioculescu, p.272-273; Ornea, p.208; Vianu, Vol. II, p.191, 192</ref> His involvement in politics engendered a collateral conflict with his son Mateiu, after the latter expressed a wish to become part of the administration (a project ridiculed by Caragiale-father).<ref>Cioculescu, p.365, 368</ref>\n\nIn December 1907, after ''Opinia'' became a mouthpiece of Ionescu's party, Caragiale received news that its headquarters had been vandalized by [[A. C. Cuza]] and his [[Nationalism|nationalist]] supporters (who were students at the [[University of Ia\u015fi]]). Just days after, when Cuza's group offered to host a Caragiale festival, he refused to participate, citing his respect for the [[freedom of the press]].<ref>Cioculescu, p.14-16</ref> It was also during the period that he published his ''[[Din carnetul unui vechi sufleur]]'', grouping short pieces about cultural figures such as [[Iorgu Caragiale]], [[Pantazi Ghica]], and [[Matei Millo]].\n\n===Final years===\n[[File:Alexandru Davila si Ion Luca Caragiale.jpg|thumb|[[Alexandru Davila]] and Ion Luca Caragiale]]\n[[File:Ion Luca Caragiale 2.jpg|thumb|Ion Luca Caragiale c. 1912]]\nBeginning in 1909, Caragiale resumed his contributions to ''[[Universul]]''.<ref>Vianu, Vol. II, p.191</ref> The same year, his [[Fantasy literature|fantasy]] piece ''[[Kir Ianulea]]'', which explored the [[history of Bucharest]] during the early 19th century and the late stages of the [[Phanariotes|Phanariote]] period, was published by ''[[Via\u0163a Rom\u00e2neasc\u0103]]''.<ref>Vianu, Vol. I, p.313; Vol. II, p.191, 205</ref> The novella partly built on ''[[Belfagor arcidiavolo]]'', by [[Renaissance literature|Renaissance]] author [[Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli]],<ref>C\u0103linescu, p.181-182; Cioculescu, p.203-207, 262; Vianu, Vol. I, p.313</ref> and was occasionally classified as an example of [[historical fiction]].<ref name=\"zarifintrod\"/> Similar stories use themes from the ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'' (''[[Abu-Hasan]]'') and popular anecdotes (''[[Pastram\u0103 trufanda]]'').<ref name=\"C\u0103linescu, p.181\">C\u0103linescu, p.181</ref> Another work of the time was ''[[Calul dracului]]'', a rural-themed account of demonic temptation, which Vianu called \"one of the most perfect short stories to have been written in Romanian language\".<ref>Vianu, Vol.I, p.313-314; Vol. II, p.205</ref>\n\nHis last collection of writings, titled ''Schi\u0163e nou\u0103'' (\"New Sketches\") saw print in 1910.<ref name=\"zarifintrod\"/><ref name=\"M\u00eendra, p.25\">M\u00eendra, p.25</ref> During that period, after giving endorsement to a project outlined by his fellow dramatist [[Alexandru Davila]], he aided in the creation of a new privately run Bucharest theater, and recorded its inauguration in his [[reportage]] ''\u00cencepem'' (\"We Begin\").<ref name=\"M\u00eendra, p.25\"/>\n\nBy that time, Ion Luca Caragiale became remarkably close to a new generation of ethnic Romanian intellectuals in [[Austria-Hungary]].

Cioculescu, p.16; Vianu, Vol. II, p.65</ref>\n\nThrough many of his traits, Caragiale was connected to a [[Balkans|Balkan]] environment of virtually permanent human contact, with its humor condensed in [[anecdote]]s, mimicry, and witty comebacks.<ref>C\u0103linescu, p.181; Vianu, Vol. I, p.307-308; Vol. II, p.195</ref> Zarifopol quoted him saying that he admired the traditional forms of entertainment, and that he admired the ''soitar\u00eci'' (\"[[buffoon]]s\").<ref name=\"zarifpubl\"/><ref>Cazimir (1967), p.46-48</ref>\n\nLargely reflecting his primordial study of [[dramaturgy]], Caragiale's literature is indebted to dialog, as well as, in rarer cases, to [[internal monologue]] and [[free indirect speech]] (the favorite technique of Naturalists).<ref>Vianu, Vol.I, p.311; Vol. II, p.204</ref> Language takes the central role in his work, often compensating for the lack of detail.<ref name=\"zarifintrod\"/><ref>M\u00eendra, p.270; Vianu, Vol.I, p.311; Vol. II, p.203-204</ref> To this was added his tendency to reduce texts to their essence\u2014he shortened down not only his own text, but also his occasional translations of stories by [[Elisabeth of Wied|Queen Elisabeth]] and even [[Miguel de Cervantes]] or [[Edgar Allan Poe]].<ref name=\"zarifintrod\"/> At times, he added a lyrical, meditative or autobiographical, perspective to his works: this trait was especially obvious in his later [[fantasy]] works (''[[Kir Ianulea]]'' and ''[[Calul dracului]]'' among them), all marked by [[Neo-romanticism|Neoromantic]] inspiration.<ref name=\"zarifintrod\"/><ref name=\"Vianu, Vol. II, p.205\">Vianu, Vol. II, p.205</ref> Zarifopol claimed that, although Caragiale often rejected the tendency of other writers to capitalize on [[picturesque]] images, he often used them in his own writings.<ref name=\"zarifintrod\"/>\n\nCaragiale arguably won as much acclaim for his rigorous approach to playwriting as for his accomplished style. With [[Alexandru Vlahu\u0163\u0103]], [[George Co\u015fbuc]] and others, he belonged to the first generation of Romanian authors to take a noted interest in imposing [[professionalism]].<ref>Vianu, Vol. III, p.14</ref> He was specific about this requirement\u2014on one occasion, he used sarcasm to overturn a common misconception, saying: \"Literature is an art that needs not be learned; whoever knows how to turn letters into syllables and the latter into words has had sufficient preparation to engage in literature.\"<ref name=\"Vianu, Vol. II, p.205\"/> Commenting on this, Vianu stressed: \"[...] even under the appearance of ease, [Caragiale] lets us catch sight of the severe law of his art\"<ref>Vianu, Vol. II, p.206</ref> (adding elsewhere that \"[Caragiale] was a scrupulous and tormented artist\").<ref>Vianu, Vol. I, p.314</ref>\n\nCaragiale compared writers who could not dissimulate their intent and generate a good story with \"a [[Strabismus|cross-eyed]] who tells you which way to go: one doesn't known if he is to go down the road he points to, or down the road he is looking at\".<ref name=\"zarifintrod\"/> Speaking in the late 1890s, he also likened writing for the stage with [[architecture]]:\n<blockquote>\"In truth, just as much as the architect's plan is not yet the final accomplishment of his intent\u2014that is to say, the monument\u2014but only its conventional recording [...], so too is the dramaturg's writing not yet the accomplishment of his intent\u2014that is to say, the comedy\u2014but the conventional recording, to which will be added the personal elements, in order to depict a development of human circumstances and deeds. In short: just as an architect's plan bears little resemblance to a painting, so does drama bear little resemblance to a poem.\"<ref name=\"Vianu, Vol. II, p.187\"/></blockquote>\n\n==Political and social vision==\n\n===Liberalism and republicanism===\n[[File:CuzaGhimpele1872.PNG|thumb|Anti-dynasty cartoon, published in ''[[Ghimpele]]'' in 1872, and illustrating the differences of opinion inside the [[Liberalism and radicalism in Romania|liberal camp]]. Left panel: [[Alexander John Cuza]] betrayed by [[Ion Br\u0103tianu]]; right panel: [[Carol I of Romania|Carol I]], supported by [[Otto von Bismarck]] and Br\u0103tianu, feeding off of [[German Empire|German]] influence and economic privilege]]\nHis interest in first-hand investigation of the human nature was accompanied, at least after he reached maturity, by a distaste for generous and [[Universalism|universalist]] theories.<ref>Cioculescu, p.9; Vianu, Vol. II, p.193-194, 196</ref> Caragiale viewed their impact on Romanian society with a critical eye. Like ''[[Junimea]]'', he was amused by the cultural legacy of [[Wallachian Revolution of 1848|1848 Wallachian revolutionaries]], and by its image in National Liberal discourse. Nevertheless, he claimed that there was a clear difference between the first generation of [[Liberalism and radicalism in Romania|liberal activists]]\u2014[[Ion C\u00e2mpineanu]], [[Ion Heliade R\u0103dulescu]], and [[Nicolae B\u0103lcescu]]\u2014and the new liberal establishment, which, as he believed, had come to cultivate [[hypocrisy]], [[demagogy]], and [[political corruption]].<ref>Ornea, p.202-204, 228</ref> He exemplified the latter group by citing some of its prominent members: [[Pantazi Ghica]], [[Nicolae Misail]] and [[Mihail P\u0103t\u00e2rl\u0103geanu]].<ref>Ornea, p.203</ref> At one point, he argued that, had they not died young, the leaders of 1848 could have found themselves best represented by the [[Conservative Party (Romania, 1880\u20131918)|Conservatives]].<ref>Ornea, p.202-203</ref> He recorded the way in which National Liberal politicians claimed to take inspiration from the revolt, and pointed out that the 1848 slogans had become rallying calls for the most banal causes.<ref>Vianu, Vol. I, p.167, 308\u2013309</ref>\n\nHis almost lifelong critique of the liberal current, marked by his conflicts with [[Dimitrie Sturdza]] and [[Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu]], was partly inspired by ''Junimea'''s guidelines\u2014in line with the ''Junimists'', Caragiale perceived liberals as agents of [[Populism]], popular Romanticism, and [[Idealism]], as tenets prevalent in the literature of his day.<ref name=\"Cioculescu, p.9\">Cioculescu, p.9</ref> For Caragiale, the resulting liberal-inspired literary works were ''spanac'' (\"[[spinach]]\").<ref>Cioculescu, p.9, 264</ref> The writer thus identified late 19th-century Romanian liberalism \"empty talk\", and his attacks on demagogy partly mirrored Maiorescu's views about the National Liberals' \"inebriation with words\".<ref>Ornea, p.205, 211, 291</ref>\n\nCaragiale centered some of his first attacks on the \"Reds\" and their leader [[C. A. Rosetti]], in whose [[republicanism]] and inflammatory rhetoric he saw the main threat to Romanian society.<ref name=\"ibrextremacar\"/><ref>Cioculescu, p.179-180; Ornea, p.209-217</ref> The writer believed that, ever since having ousted [[Alexander John Cuza]] from his throne, both Rosetti and [[Ion Br\u0103tianu]] were using their republican basis as an asset, inciting to rebellion only when their demands were not met.<ref>Ornea, p.211-213</ref> He frequently ridiculed the cult with which Rosetti surrounded figures of international republicanism, such as [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] and [[L\u00e9on Gambetta]], and indicated that the National Liberal public had very vague and impractical notions of what a republican state actually implied.<ref name=\"ibrextremacar\"/><ref>Ornea, p.210-217</ref>\n\nThe republican agitation is no longer emphasized in Caragiale's later works, as republicanism slowly faded out of the mainstream liberal discourse.<ref>Ornea, p.212</ref> Noting this, several critics believe that, in his ''[[O scrisoare pierdut\u0103]]'', which depicts the battle between two unnamed political camps, the dramatist alluded to the conflict between Br\u0103tianu's moderates and Rosetti's extremists (as indicated by the fact that all the main characters attend the same rallies).<ref name=\"ibrextremacar\"/><ref>Ornea, p.217-218</ref> This view was disputed by Zarifopol, who argued that the more pragmatic grouping stands for the Conservatives, and the demagogic one for the National Liberals as a whole.<ref>Ornea, p.217</ref>\n\n===Nationalism===\nIon Luca Caragiale was a vocal critic of [[antisemitism]], which was mostly represented by the National Liberals and [[A. C. Cuza]]'s emerging movement. At a time when the [[History of the Jews in Romania|Jewish community]] was denied [[Jewish Emancipation|emancipation]], he advocated its full integration into Romanian society, calling for [[civil rights]] to be extended to all residents of Romania. Around 1907, he tried his hand at writing a legislative proposal, according to which the Romanian state was to extend citizenship all resident [[stateless person]]s who did not enjoy foreign protection\u2014in its manuscript form, this document was kept by his friend [[Dimitrie Gusti]].<ref>Cioculescu, p.30-31</ref> According to [[Garabet Ibr\u0103ileanu]], his rejection of antisemitic views was owed either to his failure to relate with the [[middle class]] and its anti-Jewish stances, or to his \"powerful intelligence\", which contrasted with the \"instinctual, almost zoological nature\" of the antisemitic discourse.<ref name=\"ibrextremacar\"/>\n\nHis criticism of both the nationalist discourse and liberal-inspired education generated subjects for several of his shorter satirical writings. Caragiale thus authored a mock-pamphlet advertising the program of a new cultural society, ''[[Rom\u00e2nii Verzi]]'' (the \"Green Romanians\"), who took its [[Racism|racialist]] proposals to the point of arguing that \"[...] a nation must always fear other nations\".<ref>Ornea, p.224</ref> Like ''Junimea'', he was entirely opposed to the group of [[August Treboniu Laurian]] and other [[Transylvania]]n intellectuals, who attempted to reform the [[Romanian language]] by introducing new forms of speech and writing that aimed to return it closer to its [[Latin]] roots. In his stories, Caragiale created the teacher [[Marius Chico\u015f Rostogan]], a caricature of both the liberal educators and the Transylvanian \"Latinists\".<ref name=\"Ornea, p.226\">Ornea, p.226</ref> While in [[Berlin]], the writer also persiflaged some of [[Vasile Alecsandri]]'s liberal and [[Patriotism|patriotic]] writings\u2014he completed Alecsandri's nationalist poem ''Tricolorul'' with sarcastic verses that were meant to enhance its [[Xenophobia|xenophobic]] feel (showing the Romanians ready to do battle against all their perceived enemies in [[Eastern Europe]]).<ref>Cioculescu, p.68, 216, 252\u2013253</ref>\n\nNevertheless, various authors believe that a young Caragiale did indeed support nationalist liberal policies, and presume that he was behind a series of anti-Jewish columns, published by ''[[Voin\u0163a Na\u0163ional\u0103]]'' during the early 1880s.<ref name=\"Cioculescu, p.9\"/> This was for long disputed: [[rabbi]] and literary historian [[Moses Gaster]] attributed the pieces to [[Nicolae Xenopol]], while researcher [[\u015eerban Cioculescu]], who originally doubted them, eventually agreed that they formed an integral part of Caragiale's work.<ref name=\"Cioculescu, p.21\"/>\n\n===Conservatism and traditionalism===\n[[File:Caragiale and Vlahuta.jpeg|thumb|Caragiale (left) and [[Alexandru Vlahu\u0163\u0103]]]]\nIn some of his early articles, and again as he distanced himself from ''Junimea'', the writer showed himself to be a vocal critic of the Conservative doctrine and its ''Junimist'' representatives. This is especially evident in his 1907 essay and in some of his stories.<ref>Ornea, p.228-229</ref> Caragiale claimed that both [[Titu Maiorescu]] and [[Petre P. Carp]] were \"[[boyar]]s\" who prioritized the interest of their [[social class]] (which was by then nonetheless defunct, as traditional [[Privilege (legal ethics)|privilege]] had been formally abolished a generation earlier).<ref>Cioculescu, p.22-23, 29, 121, 304</ref> Cioculescu attributed this to an \"[[inferiority complex]]\" Caragiale felt in respect to his former patrons.<ref name=\"Cioculescu, p.22\">Cioculescu, p.22</ref>\n\nDespite his brief association with the mainstream Conservatives, Caragiale was probably never their partisan, and only hoped that the party could open the way for the reforms advertised by [[George Panu]] and [[Alexandru Lahovari]].<ref>Cioculescu, p.269, 271; Ornea, p.206-209</ref> When disappointed with their failure to promote change, he moved on to support [[Take Ionescu]] and his dissident grouping.<ref>Cioculescu, p.271-273; Ornea, p.208</ref> Uniquely among students of Caragiale's work, [[George C\u0103linescu]] argued that the writer's main interest was not in criticizing the liberals, but actually in an overall rejection of the most embedded ''Junimist'' tenets, which, in C\u0103linescu's view, had engendered \"a lack of faith in the country's own powers\".<ref>Cazimir (1967), p.54</ref> [[Paul Zarifopol]] believed that several of his ''[[Momente \u015fi schi\u0163e]]'' characters, including the effeminate high life chronicler Edgar Bostandaki, are caricatures of the Conservatives.<ref name=\"zarifpubl\"/>\n\nCaragiale contrasted the other major writers of his generation, including his friends Mihai Eminescu, [[Ioan Slavici]], [[Barbu \u015etef\u0103nescu Delavrancea]], and ''[[S\u0103m\u0103n\u0103torul]]'' journal founder [[Alexandru Vlahu\u0163\u0103]], all of whom were advocating a return to the rural sphere and peasant traditionalism.<ref>Vianu, Vol.I, p.312; Vol. II, p.184, 199</ref> In ''[[Moftul Rom\u00e2n]]'', he [[Parody|parodied]] the [[archaism]]s favored by \u015etef\u0103nescu Delavrancea;<ref>Cioculescu, p.41-43; Vianu, Vol. II, p.185</ref> during his final years, he also questioned the aesthetic value of \u015etef\u0103nescu Delavrancea's medieval-themed play ''[[Apus de soare]]''.<ref>Cioculescu, p.253</ref> Prominent nationalists and traditionalists tended to be reserved in their assessment of Caragiale's literary contributions\u2014they include his friend Eminescu<ref name=\"Cioculescu, p.6\"/> and historian [[Nicolae Iorga]].<ref>Cioculescu, p.28, 305</ref>\n\nNonetheless, Ion Luca Caragiale was, according to Zarifopol, a passionate advocate of tradition in front of innovation, and \"a defender of the well-established truths\".<ref name=\"zarifintrod\"/> [[Tudor Vianu]] also evidenced that Caragiale treasured his [[Romanian Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] identity, frequently appealing to God and the saints in both his private life and his writings.<ref name=\"Vianu, Vol. II, p.197\">Vianu, Vol. II, p.197</ref> According to [[Ioan Slavici]], Caragiale defined himself as \"a right-believing [[Christianity|Christian]]\", and disagreed with Eminescu on the nature of religion (at a time when the poet was a passionate student of [[Buddhism]]).<ref name=\"Vianu, Vol. II, p.197\"/> Cioculescu called this trait \"primitive religiosity\".<ref name=\"Cioculescu, p.7\">Cioculescu, p.7</ref> The writer is also known to have convinced that [[luck]] and [[destiny]] manifested themselves in life,<ref>C\u0103linescu, p.180; Cioculescu, p.7; Vianu, Vol. II, p.204</ref> and his ''[[C\u0103nu\u0163\u0103 om sucit]]'', a short story about a proverbially unlucky fellow, is thought to have referred to its author.<ref>C\u0103linescu, p.180; Vianu, Vol. II, p.204</ref> His [[superstition]]s were accompanied by a series of [[phobia]]s, particularly [[pyrophobia]] and [[nosophobia]].<ref name=\"Cioculescu, p.7\"/>\n\n===Caragiale and the modernists===\nIon Luca Caragiale was mostly critical of literary experiments and the newer stages of [[Modernism]]. On this basis, he persistently ridiculed [[Alexandru Macedonski]]'s style, especially after the latter adopted [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]]. Much of his own poetry, especially pieces published in ''[[Moftul Rom\u00e2n]]'' after 1901, parodied the [[Symbolist movement in Romania|Romanian Symbolist clubs]] and the [[Parnassianism]] of Macedonski's ''[[Literatorul]]''<ref>Cioculescu, p.63-64, 67, 134</ref> (among the best-known of these targets was poet [[Cincinat Pavelescu]], who was coeditor at ''Literatorul'').<ref>Cioculescu, p.134</ref>\n\nAs editor of ''[[Epoca (Romania)|Epoca]]'''s literary supplement, Caragiale refused to publish a descriptive poem by the young [[Gala Galaction]], claiming that it was not poetry (when [[Nicolae Filipescu]] asked him to reconsider, he threatened to quit).<ref>Vianu, Vol. III, p.281</ref> Late in his life, he reserved explicit criticism for the new generation of Symbolists, whose work, he argued, belonged to \"the church\" of [[Belgium|Belgian]] poet [[Maurice Maeterlinck]].<ref>Cioculescu, p.67</ref> Zarifopol also noted that, for as long as he lived, the writer derided the innovative works of [[Henrik Ibsen]] and [[August Strindberg]], but pointed out that Caragiale had never actually read or seen their plays.<ref name=\"zarifintrod\"/>\n\nNevertheless, Caragiale was not entirely opposed to newer trends in poetry and art. Literary critic [[Matei C\u0103linescu]] believes that he genuinely admired ''\u00cen ora\u015ful cu trei sute de biserici'' (\"In the City with Three Hundred Churches\"), a [[free verse]] poem by the Symbolist [[Ion Minulescu]].<ref name=\"mateicalinescu\">[[Matei C\u0103linescu]], \"Prefa\u0163\u0103\", in [[Ion Minulescu]], ''Roman\u0163e pentru mai t\u00e2rziu \u015fi alte poezii'', [[Editura pentru literatur\u0103]], Bucharest, 1967, p.XIV. {{OCLC|6434366}}</ref> This work is believed to have inspired a 1908 parody by Caragiale, in which the writer proclaimed his support for Take Ionescu.<ref name=\"mateicalinescu\"/><ref>Cioculescu, p.66</ref> According to poet and essayist [[Tudor Arghezi]], Caragiale also admired the works of [[\u015etefan Luchian]], a [[Postimpressionism|Postimpressionist]] whose paintings were often exhibited in Bucharest galleries.<ref>[[Tudor Arghezi]], ''Scrieri. Proze'', [[Editura Minerva]], Bucharest, 1985, p.621. {{OCLC|32599658}}</ref>\n\n===Caragiale and the Left===\nMoving toward the [[Left-wing politics|Left]] during the final decades of his life, the writer maintained connection with the [[Socialism|socialists]], but was nonetheless ambivalent to their goals. As Cioculescu noted, he welcomed the Bucharest celebration of [[May Day]] in one of his ''[[Moftul Rom\u00e2n]]'' pieces,<ref name=\"Cioculescu, p.22\"/> and probably agreed to lecture for the Workers' Club in the capital.<ref name=\"ibrextremacar\"/><ref name=\"Cioculescu, p.22\"/> Some of his writings were hosted by the socialist journal ''[[Rom\u00e2nia Muncitoare]]''.<ref>M\u00eendra, p.11</ref> According to [[Garabet Ibr\u0103ileanu]], himself a socialist at the time, \"sometime after 1890, Caragiale briefly flirted with socialism.\"<ref name=\"ibrextremacar\"/>\n\nHowever, over the same period, Caragiale ridiculed several socialist militants, referring to one of their leaders with the derisive nickname ''Edgard Spanachidi'' (itself a derivative of \"spinach\").<ref>Cioculescu, p.22, 64</ref> Instead, his loose association with [[George Panu]] signified a return to [[Radicalism (historical)|radicalism]], and saw him campaigning in favor of [[universal suffrage]] and a complete [[land reform]]<ref>Cioculescu, p.23, 46\u201347; Ornea, p.208-209</ref>\u2014this clashed with the views he had expressed earlier in life, and Caragiale was careful not to let it seem that he had returned to the \"Red\" liberalism of his youth.<ref>Ornea, p.209</ref>\n\nIn one of his articles, Ion Luca Caragiale commented with irony on the [[Marxism|Marxist]] views of his friend [[Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea]]: he compared the latter's way of dining on a leg of veal, laboriously carving it into sections, to his philosophical approach. Caragiale thus noted that [[philosophical skepticism]] was equivalent to stripping the bone of its flesh piece by piece, and then throwing it to the dogs\u2014without having been able to fully document the leg of veal or its substance.<ref>Vianu, Vol. II, p.194</ref> Nevertheless, as Tudor Vianu indicated, although Caragiale preferred observation and spontaneity to speculation, he was not averse to pure philosophical analysis, and frequently quoted the [[classics]] in defense of his aesthetic guidelines.<ref>Vianu, Vol. II, p.194-195</ref> Late in his life, Caragiale also sparked debates after deriding the emerging [[Poporanism]], a school of thought which took its inspiration from socialism, [[agrarianism]] and traditionalism.<ref>Cioculescu, p.43, 67</ref> He is also known to have been amused by the [[1907 German federal election|German election of 1907]] and the resulting defeat registered by the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party]].<ref>Cioculescu, p.271</ref>\n\nCaragiale maintained a friendship with Dobrogeanu-Gherea for much of his life. He was especially interested in news of Dobrogeanu-Gherea having become involved in the 1905 [[Russian battleship Potemkin]] scandal, after the aging socialist decided to offer his help to the refugee sailors as they arrived in [[Constan\u0163a]].<ref>Cioculescu, p.243-246</ref> During his time in [[Berlin]], he repeatedly tried to convince the Dobrogeanu-Ghereas to leave their home in Romania and join him abroad.<ref>Cioculescu, p.240</ref> Nonetheless, he criticized the philosopher when the latter refused to be decorated by [[King of Romania|King]] [[Carol I of Romania|Carol I]] (1909).<ref>Cioculescu, p.245-246</ref> Around 1907, the dramatist was also interested in the activities of [[Christian Rakovsky]], who was trying to make his way back into Romania, and closely followed news of street clashes between his supporters and the authorities.<ref>Cioculescu, p.246-248</ref>\n\n==Settings==\n[[File:Sinaia Prahova old pic.jpg|thumb|Early 20th century panorama of [[Sinaia]]]]\nThe writer had an unprecedented familiarity with the social environments, traits, opinions, manners of speech, means of expression and lifestyle choices of his day\u2014from the rural atmosphere of his early childhood, going through his vast experience as a journalist, to the high spheres of politics ([[National Liberal Party (Romania, 1875)|National Liberal]] as well as [[Conservative Party (Romania, 1880\u20131918)|Conservative]], ''Junimist'' as well as socialist).<ref>Cioculescu, p.6, 7\u20138;

Vianu, Vol. II, p.199-200</ref> This large fresco drew comparisons with his generation colleague [[Ion Creang\u0103]], who was argued to have done the same for the countryside.<ref>Ornea, p.229</ref> Caragiale was especially proud of the opening paragraph in his ''Ultima emisiune...'' story, part of ''[[Momente \u015fi schi\u0163e]]'', which, he believed, the \"corner of a slum\" was suggested to perfection.<ref>Cioculescu, p.71</ref>\n\n[[Tudor Vianu]] also noted that, among cities and towns, Caragiale preferred Bucharest and those provincial centers most exposed to [[Central Europe]]an influences (specifically, the summer retreats in the [[Prahova Valley]] and other Wallachian stations on the way to Transylvania).<ref name=\"Vianu, Vol. II, p.199\">Vianu, Vol. II, p.199</ref> The enclosed world of the [[C\u0103ile Ferate Rom\u00e2ne|Romanian Railways]] also appealed to the writer, and an impressive number of his sketches relate to it in various ways.<ref name=\"zarifintrod\"/><ref name=\"Vianu, Vol. II, p.199\"/>\n\n==Collective characters==\n[[File:Sava Hentia - Targul Mosilor.jpg|thumb|''T\u00e2rgul Mo\u015filor'', the [[fair]] in [[Obor]] (late 19th-century painting by [[Sava Hen\u021bia]])]]\nConfessing at some point that \"the world was my school\", Caragiale dissimulated his background and critical eye as a means to blend into each environment he encountered, and even adopted the manners and speech patterns he later recorded in his literary work.<ref>Cioculescu, p.6-7; Vianu, Vol. II, p.195</ref> He thus encouraged familiarity, allowing people to reveal their histories, motivations, and culture.<ref name=\"Vianu, Vol. II, p.195\"/> Vianu recounted: \"The man was a consummate actor and a ''[[Deadpan|pince-sans-rire]]'', an ironist [...] to the point where his partners of dialog were never sure if they were spoken to \u00abseriously\u00bb [...].\"<ref name=\"Vianu, Vol. II, p.196\">Vianu, Vol. II, p.196</ref> In one of his pieces from 1899, he welcomed the famous actors [[Eleonora Duse]] and [[Jean Mounet-Sully]] to Bucharest, imitating the exaggerated style of other theater chroniclers\u2014the article ended with Caragiale confessing that he had not actually seen the two perform.<ref name=\"Vianu, Vol. II, p.196\"/> In one other instance, as a means to comment on [[plagiarism]], the author also parodied his own ''O f\u0103clie de Pa\u015fte''\u2014which he turned into the sketch, ''Noaptea \u00cenvierii''.<ref name=\"Vianu, Vol. II, p.205\"/>\n\nIn ''1907, din prim\u0103var\u0103 p\u00e2n\u0103 \u00een toamn\u0103'', his late and disillusioned work, Caragiale lashed out at the traditional class of political clients, with an indictment which, Tudor Vianu believed, also served to identify the main focus of his other writings:\n<blockquote>\"plebs incapable of work and lacking employment, impoverished suburban small traders and street vendors, petty dangerous agitators of the villages and of the areas adjacent to towns, bullying election agents; and then the hybrid product of all levels of schooling, semi-cultured intellectuals, lawyers and lawyerlings, professors, teachers and teacherlings, semi-illiterate and unfrocked priests, illiterate schoolteachers\u2014all of them beer garden theorists; next come the great functionaries and the little clerks, most of them removable from office.\"<ref>Vianu, Vol. II, p.190</ref></blockquote>\n\nDirect criticism was nonetheless rare in Caragiale's fiction: Vianu believed to have found traces of it in ''[[O scrisoare pierdut\u0103]]'' (\"the most cruel [of his satires]\") and in ''[[Grand Hotel \"Victoria rom\u00e2n\u0103\"]]'' (\"the most bitter\").<ref name=\"Vianu, Vol. II, p.201\">Vianu, Vol. II, p.201</ref> On several occasions, Caragiale showed or even defined himself as a sentimental, and his modesty was acknowledged by several of his friends.<ref>Vianu, Vol.I, p.314; Vol. II, p.197-198; Vol.III, p.74, 75\u201376</ref> Vianu noted that, alongside his Christian [[ethos]], this contributed to his distant, calm and often sympathetic overall take on society.<ref>Vianu, Vol.I, p.314; Vol. II, p.200-201</ref> In his words:\n<blockquote>\"A wave of charm, of reconciliation with life passes above all [his characters], one which, if it only assumes light and superficial shapes, experienced by naive people with harmless manias, is a sign that the collective existence is taking place in shelter from the great trials.\"<ref>Vianu, Vol. II, p.200</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn contrast with this, [[Poporanism|Poporanist]] critic [[Garabet Ibr\u0103ileanu]] argued that Caragiale actually hated the people who inspired his works, and claimed that the writer had made this clear during one of their conversations.<ref name=\"Cazimir 1967, p.44\">Cazimir (1967), p.44</ref> His account was considered doubtful by researcher [[\u015etefan Cazimir]], who believed that Ibr\u0103ileanu was using it to back a polemic and singular overview of Caragiale's work.<ref name=\"Cazimir 1967, p.44\"/>\n\nAccording to Vianu, there is a manifest difference between Ion Luca Caragiale's comedies and his ''[[Momente \u015fi schi\u0163e]]'': the former are, in his view, driven by situations and circumstances, whereas the latter sees Caragiale developing his original perspective to its fullest.<ref>Vianu, Vol.I, p.309-310; Vol. II, p.200-201</ref> This, he argues, was determined by important social changes\u2014a move from a traditional world\u2014awkwardly attempting to digest [[Westernization]], [[modernization]], and [[Francization|Francized]] culture\u2014, to a more stable and prosperous environment.<ref>Vianu, Vol.I, p.309-310; Vol. II, p.200</ref> A similar division was applied by Ibr\u0103ileanu.<ref name=\"ibrextremacar\"/><ref>Ornea, p.221</ref>\n\n==Types==\n\n===Theoretical aspects===\nThe form of [[Literary realism|Realism]] favored by Caragiale placed types of characters at the center of literary creativity, owing to the influence of [[Classicism]].<ref name=\"Vianu, Vol. II, p.201\"/> Several critics have credited ''Momente \u015fi schi\u0163e'', as well as all his dramas, with providing some of the first truly believable portrayals in local literature.<ref name=\"zarifintrod\"/><ref>M\u00eendra, p.269-270</ref> Vianu stressed that Classicist borrowings in Caragiale's writings were limited, indicating that Caragiale parted with the notion of \"generic types\" to look for the \"social\" ones.<ref name=\"Vianu, Vol. II, p.201\"/> In parallel, literary critic [[George C\u0103linescu]] argued that \"[t]he typological structure is present in Caragiale's work as a supporting structure, without being essential.\"<ref>C\u0103linescu, p.183</ref>\n\nIn Vianu's assessment, the universal human nature was important to Caragiale, but not made instantly obvious (as opposed to the immediate importance his characters were meant to have in the eyes of his public).<ref>Vianu, Vol. II, p.201-202</ref> Vianu illustrated this concept after investigating the manner in which Caragiale completed his ''O scrisoare pierdut\u0103'': the author was for long undecided about which character was to win the electoral battle on which the play centers, but opted for Agami\u0163\u0103 Dandanache, the senile [[Radicalism (historical)|radical]], because his victory was to give the play more depth.<ref name=\"Vianu, Vol. II, p.202\">Vianu, Vol. II, p.202</ref> Caragiale was thus quoted saying that Dandanache was \"more stupid\" than the clueless politician Tache Farfuridi, and \"more of a scoundrel\" than the unprincipled and cunning journalist Nae Ca\u0163avencu.<ref>Cazimir (1967), p.143; Ornea, p.221; Vianu, Vol. II, p.202</ref>\n\nIn Vianu's view, ''Momente \u015fi schi\u0163e'' was more vague in this respect, giving little insight into morals and states of mind, whereas the other, longer, novellas did depict feelings and occasionally provided additional details such as [[physiology]] or [[cenesthesia]].<ref name=\"Vianu, Vol. II, p.202\"/> Also according to Vianu, Ion Luca Caragiale, unlike the Naturalists, was generally not interested in offering the reader access to his characters' [[Psychology|psychological]] background\u2014aside from his ''[[N\u0103pasta]]'' and ''[[P\u0103cat]]'', and ''[[O f\u0103clie de Pa\u015fte]]'', he only adopted the psychological technique in satirical contexts, as a means to parody its use.<ref>Vianu, Vol. I, p.312</ref> A similar view was expressed by Vianu's predecessor, [[Silvian Iosifescu]], who also stressed that Caragiale always avoided applying the Naturalist technique to its fullest,<ref name=\"M\u00eendra, p.271\">M\u00eendra, p.271</ref> while George C\u0103linescu himself believed that the characters' motivations in ''O f\u0103clie de Pa\u015fte'' are actually physiological and [[Ethnology|ethnological]].<ref name=\"C\u0103linescu, p.179\">C\u0103linescu, p.179</ref>\n\nMaiorescu was especially fond of the way in which Caragiale balanced his personal perspective and the generic traits he emphasized: speaking of Leiba Zibal, the [[History of the Jews in Romania|Jewish]] character in ''O f\u0103clie de Pa\u015fte'' who defends himself out of fear, he drew a comparison with Shakespeare's [[Shylock]]. He thus noted that, for all the differences in style between the two authors, both their characters stood for the Jewish people as a whole.<ref name=\"zarifintrod\"/><ref>Ornea, p.50</ref> This assessment was backed by Maiorescu's adversary, [[Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea]].<ref name=\"dbrghestmet\"/> George C\u0103linescu also believed that, aside from his individual nature, Zibal provided readers with an accurate insight into Jewish reactions to systemic persecution and death threats.<ref name=\"C\u0103linescu, p.179\"/> Such assessments were rejected by [[Paul Zarifopol]], who opposed generalizations and commented that the work only referred to \"[t]he ingenious cruelty of a man maddened by fear\".<ref name=\"zarifintrod\"/>\n\n===Allegories===\nOne of Caragiale's main and earliest types is that of the young man gripped by love, expressing himself through emphatic and Romantic clich\u00e9s\u2014its main representative is ''[[O noapte furtunoas\u0103]]'''s Ric\u0103 Venturiano. As Vianu commented, Caragiale exploited the theme to so much success that it took another generation for youthful love to be presented in a non-comedic context (with the common signature writings of [[\u015etefan Octavian Iosif]] and [[Dimitrie Anghel]]).<ref>Vianu, Vol. II, p.454-455</ref> At the other end are [[Patriarchy|patriarchal]] figures, heads of families who seem unable or unwilling to investigate their wives' [[Adultery|adulterous]] relations with younger men.<ref name=\"danmanuca\"/><ref>Cazimir (1967), p.55-56; Cioculescu, p.56-59, 83\u201384, 85\u201388, 113</ref> This behavior is notably present in ''O noapte furtunoas\u0103'', where the aged Dumitrache fails to note even the most obvious signs that his wife Veta is in love with his good friend Chiriac.<ref>Cazimir (1967), p.55, 112\u2013119; Cioculescu, p.83-84</ref> A more complex situation is present in ''O scrisoare pierdut\u0103'', where political boss Trahanache cannot tell that his wife Joi\u0163ica is having an affair with Tip\u0103tescu, and, when confronted with the evidence, is more interested in proving that she is not.<ref>Cazimir (1967), p.55, 133\u2013134; Cioculescu, p.85-88</ref>\n\nWith Venturiano, Caragiale also introduces criticism of the liberal journalist and lawyers. A law school student, Venturiano contributes long and exaggerated articles to the republican press, which recall those authored by [[C. A. Rosetti]] and his collaborators.<ref name=\"ibrextremacar\"/><ref>Cioculescu, p.179-180, 183\u2013184; Ornea, p.210-211</ref> A more elaborate such character is Nae Ca\u0163avencu, who plays a major part in ''O scrisoare pierdut\u0103'', and who, using a \"Red\" discourse, attacks politicians on all sides with turbulent remarks and recourse to [[blackmail]].<ref name=\"ibrextremacar\"/><ref>Ornea, p.217-221</ref> He profits from the more moderate attitudes of his adversaries to proclaim himself a [[Progressivism|progressive]] politician, and he is successful in doing so\u2014Ca\u0163avencu rallies around him a group of teachers and other state employees.<ref>Ornea, p.217-219</ref> The only person who is able to stop his rise is Agami\u0163\u0103 Dandanache, an old [[Wallachian Revolution of 1848|1848 revolutionary]]. Danadanche, shown to have been sidelined from politics, makes a comeback at a time when the factions needs his inoffensive presence as a third-party, and, although senile, has a vast experience in blackmailing.<ref>Cazimir (1967), p.143-144; Ornea, p.220-221</ref> [[\u015etefan Cazimir]] linked Dandanache to a new [[aristocracy]], created around the first generation of Romanian liberals, and likened him to a [[Hidalgo (Spanish nobility)|hidalgo]].<ref>Cazimir (1967), p.144</ref> Tache Farfuridi, a competitor to both, has been described by Cazimir as a conformist self-seeker, in the manner of [[M. and Mme. Joseph Prudhomme|M. Joseph Prudhomme]], a character made famous by [[Henri Monnier]]'s prose.<ref>Cazimir (1967), p.136-137</ref>\n\nWritten between the two other comedies, ''[[Conu Leonida fa\u0163\u0103 cu reac\u0163iunea]]'' depicts the long-term effects of republican discourse on its fascinated audience, through the sayings and actions of Leonida. The latter, whose source of income is a state [[pension]], notably supports the notion that the \"Red\" republic will provide each clerk with a salary, a pension, as well as a [[debt moratorium]]<ref>Cioculescu, p.334; Ornea, p.215</ref>\u2014[[\u015eerban Cioculescu]] noted that this request had already been voiced in real life, and issued as a political program by an obscure [[Utopian socialism|Utopian socialist]] named Pi\u0163urc\u0103.<ref>Cioculescu, p.334</ref> Eventually, Leonida is convinced that revolution cannot be on the rise, since the authorities have banned the firing of weapons within city limits.<ref>Cazimir (1967), p.129; Cioculescu, p.337</ref> Similar fallacies are uttered by one of the secondary characters in ''[[D-ale carnavalului]]'', known to the other protagonists as ''Catindatul'', who has a vague familiarity with both [[Subjective idealism|subjective idealist]] and [[Materialism|materialist]] tenets, the sources for his absurd theories about [[suggestibility]] and \"magnetism\"\u2014two processes in which he sees the universal source for all discomfort or disease.<ref>Cazimir (1967), p.155-157</ref> In parallel, Zarifopol argued, the writer had even allowed ironic reflections on the impact of various theories to seep into a more serious work, ''O f\u0103clie de Pa\u015fte'', where two students terrify the innkeeper Zibal by casually discussing [[anthropological criminology]].<ref name=\"zarifintrod\"/>\n\nSeveral other of Caragiale's characters have traditionally been considered [[Allegory|allegories]] of [[social class]]es and even regional identities. One of the most famous ones is [[Mitic\u0103]], a recurring character who stands for ordinary [[Bucharest]]ers, [[Wallachia]]ns or [[Muntenia]]ns in general.<ref name=\"danmanuca\"/><ref name=\"C\u0103linescu, p.181\"/> A [[Hypocrisy|hypocritical]] and seemingly superficial man, Mitic\u0103 expresses himself through either platitudes or clich\u00e9s he believes are clever,<ref name=\"danmanuca\"/> and, illustrating a tendency Caragiale first recorded in his ''[[Moftul Rom\u00e2n]]'', quickly dismisses all important things he is confronted with.<ref name=\"C\u0103linescu, p.181\"/> Similarly, the teacher [[Marius Chico\u015f Rostogan]], who is present or named in several sketches, stands for those [[Transylvania]]n expatriates in Romania whose sympathies went to the liberal current.<ref name=\"Ornea, p.226\"/> His discourse, through which Caragiale sarcastically illustrates liberal tenets in respect to [[Education in Romania|Romanian education]], is centered on a disregard for content and a rigor for memorizing irrelevant details.<ref name=\"zarifintrod\"/><ref name=\"Ornea, p.226\"/> It has been proposed that Rostogan is at least partly based on Vasile Grigore Borgovan, a Transylvanian-born educator and resident of [[Drobeta-Turnu Severin|Turnu Severin]].<ref>Cioculescu, p.254</ref>\n\n''Cet\u0103\u0163eanul turmentat'', an unnamed inebriated man who makes brief but relevant appearances in ''O scrisoare pierdut\u0103'', is thought to symbolize simple townsfolk, utterly confused by the political battle going on around them, and ignored by all the notabilities.<ref>Cioculescu, p.80; Vianu, Vol.I, p.309; Vol. II, p.201</ref> Like his counterpart, the police agent Ghi\u0163\u0103 Pristanda, the inebriated elector has no relevant personal ambition,<ref>Cazimir (1967), p.143-149</ref> and stands for the so-called \"government dowry\"\u2014people afraid of losing their offices, and ready to back whoever is in power.<ref>Cioculescu, p.80-81</ref> According to C\u0103linescu, the inebriated citizen worships authority as a \"supreme god\", despite all its absurdities.<ref>Cazimir (1967), p.55</ref> He repeatedly claims to have served Trahanache during [[Alexander John Cuza]]'s ousting, but his supposed patron only acknowledges him once, when asking party members to \"escort this honorable person outside\".<ref>Cazimir (1967), p.146</ref>\n\nIn a number of his short stories and sketches, Caragiale makes use of another particularly ''Junimist'' theme, and investigates the glamorous but superficial impact of [[modernization]] on [[upper class|high society]].<ref name=\"ibrextremacar\"/><ref>Ornea, p.222-224</ref> In one sketch, a couple of ladies dine in an opulent salon, while cursing their maid, gossiping, and showing interest in vulgar subjects.<ref name=\"ibrextremacar\"/><ref>Ornea, p.222-223</ref> The characters in these writings tend to resemble each other, evidencing the generic traits of the well-to-do.<ref>Ornea, p.223</ref>\n\n===Other traits and characters===\n[[Anxiety|Anxieties]] take the central stage in several of Caragiale's writings. From early on, Caragiale's minute analysis of mounting terror in ''O f\u0103clie de Pa\u015fte'' won the praise of [[Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea]].<ref>M\u00eendra, p.267</ref> In several of his sketches and stories, characters are driven to despair by their inability to cope with real or presumed changes in their environment.<ref name=\"holbanemigr\"/><ref name=\"Cioculescu, p.89\">Cioculescu, p.89</ref> This is shown to have happened to characters such as Leiba Zibal, Stavrache\u2014the pub owner in ''[[\u00cen vreme de r\u0103zboi]]''\u2014, as well as Anghelache (the suicide victim in ''Inspec\u0163iune...'', part of ''[[Momente \u015fi schi\u0163e]]'').<ref>C\u0103linescu, p.180; Cioculescu, p.89</ref> \u015eerban Cioculescu referred to the latter three as \"great [[Neurosis|neurotics]]\",<ref name=\"Cioculescu, p.89\"/> while Iosifescu defined Zibal and Stavrache as \"[[Dementia|demented]]\".<ref name=\"M\u00eendra, p.271\"/> Among the group of insane characters in Caragiale's work, C\u0103linescu counted those of sketches and stories like ''1 Aprilie'' (\"1st of April\"), where an [[April Fools' Day|April Fool]] ends with a murder, and ''[[Dou\u0103 loturi]]'', where the clerk Lefter Popescu goes through the tribulations of having lost his winning ticket.<ref>Cazimir (1967), p.56; C\u0103linescu, p.179-180</ref>\n\nAnxiety over imminent events grips the main characters in ''Conu Leonida fa\u0163\u0103 cu reac\u0163iunea'', and plays a part in female behavior as depicted in all his other comedies.<ref>Cioculescu, p.83-88, 89\u201392</ref> A special kind of fear animates the main protagonists of ''D-ale carnavalului'', whose jealousy leads them to act irrationally.<ref>Cazimir (1967), p.149-157; Cioculescu, p.89-92</ref> Thus, Iancu Pampon, an assistant-barber and former police officer, and his female counterpart, the republican suburbanite Mi\u0163a Baston, are determined to uncover their partners' amorous escapades, and their hectic inquiry combines real clues with figments of imagination, fits of passionate rage with moments of sad meditation, and violent threats with periods of resignation.<ref>Cazimir (1967), p.149-155</ref> Glimpses into this type of behavior have been noted in other plays by Caragiale: Cazimir placed emphasis on the fact that Farfuridi is shown to be extremely cautious towards all unplanned changes, and consumes much of his energy in preserving a largely pointless daily routine.<ref>Cazimir (1967), p.137-138</ref>\n\nMany of Caragiale's writings reproduce discussions between clerks on their time off, which usually take the shape of generic and awkward forays into culture or politics. Several of the characters in his sketches spuriously claim to be personal friends of major political figures of the day, or to have access to the back-rooms of politics and journalism.<ref>Cioculescu, p.113, 114</ref> Although often alarmed by political or social developments, they tend to accommodate them quickly, and often encourage each other during very long stays at the [[beer garden]].<ref>Ornea, p.223-224</ref> Gravitating in this environment are the petty journalists, who boast access to unlikely [[Scoop (term)|scoops]], such as [[Bulgaria]] having decided to invade Romania.<ref name=\"ibrextremacar\"/><ref name=\"Cioculescu, p.114\">Cioculescu, p.114</ref> In one instance, Caragiale invents Caracudi, a newspaperman who writes his [[Sensationalism|sensationalist]] articles while relaxing in the park.<ref name=\"Cioculescu, p.114\"/>\n\nCaragiale's [[persona]] is placed in numerous of his works. Aside from deduced self-portraits in ''[[C\u0103nu\u0163\u0103 om sucit]]'' and elsewhere, he created the famous background character Nenea Iancu (\"Uncle Iancu\"), building on his colloquial name and his status as a regular client of the beer gardens.<ref>Vianu, Vol. II, p.204</ref> He introduces several of his ''Momente \u015fi schi\u0163e'' characters as personal friends, and garnishes the stories with intimate details.<ref>Cioculescu, p.56-57</ref> Late in his life, he even confessed that the affair involving Venturiano, Dumitrache, and Dumitrache's wife Veta was partly based on an amorous misadventure he experienced as a young man.<ref>Cioculescu, p.279</ref>\n\n==Literary influences==\n[[File:Daumier - Honest people.jpg|thumb|''We are all honest people, let's embrace one another, and let this be over with'', 1834 print by [[Honor\u00e9 Daumier]]]]\nAside from the many authors whose works he quoted, translated or [[Parody|parodied]], Ion Luca Caragiale built on a vast literary legacy. According to literary historian [[\u015etefan Cazimir]]: \"No writer ever had as large a number of precursors [as Caragiale], just as no other artistic synthesis was ever more organic and more spontaneous.\"<ref>Cazimir (1967), p.63-64</ref>\n\nA man of the theater first and foremost, Caragiale was well-acquainted with the work of his predecessors, from [[William Shakespeare]] to the [[Romanticism|Romantics]], and heavily impressed by the French ''[[com\u00e9die en vaudeville]]''.<ref name=\"Vianu, Vol. I, p.310\"/> He applied the notion of [[well-made play]]s, as theorized by [[Eug\u00e8ne Scribe]], and was also influenced by the [[dramaturgy]] of [[Eug\u00e8ne Marin Labiche]] and [[Victorien Sardou]].<ref name=\"danmanuca\"/><ref>Cazimir (1967), p.96-101; Vianu, Vol. I, p.310-311, 314</ref> Reportedly, Labiche was his favorite author.<ref>Cazimir (1967), p.98</ref>\n\nThe writer himself cited [[Cilibi Moise]], a [[History of the Jews in Romania|Wallachian Jewish]] [[peddler]] and [[Aphorism|aphorist]], as an early influence, recalling how, as a child, he used to read his [[one-liner joke]]s, and treasured them as exceptional samples of concise humor.<ref name=\"Cazimir 1967, p.62\">Cazimir (1967), p.62</ref> He was similarly impressed by the works of Moise's contemporary, the prolific author [[Anton Pann]], whose accomplishments he praised during talks with his fellow ''[[Convorbiri Critice]]'' contributors,<ref name=\"Cazimir 1967, p.62\"/> and whose work served as a source for at least one of his own stories.<ref name=\"zarifintrod\"/> [[Nicolae Filimon]], whom Caragiale praised on several occasions, was the author of short stories which several authors have identified as less accomplished versions of Ric\u0103 Venturiano.<ref>Cazimir (1967), p.82-84</ref> A similar connection has been traced between the various sketches authored by [[Ion Heliade R\u0103dulescu]], in which Transylvanian writers are the object of ridicule, and Caragiale's character [[Marius Chico\u015f Rostogan]].<ref>Cazimir (1967), p.84-86</ref> Caragiale's late admiration for [[Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu]] was also linked to affinities in comedic styles,<ref>Cazimir (1967), p.86-89</ref> as was his companionship with [[Iacob Negruzzi]] (himself the author of sarcastic pieces ridiculing the liberal politicians and lawyers).<ref name=\"zarifintrod\"/><ref>Cazimir (1967), p.89-93; Vianu, Vol.II, p.88</ref>\n\nCaragiale is also believed to have used and developed several themes already present in [[Theatre of Romania|Romanian theater]]. One such precursor is the author of comedies [[Teodor Myller]], especially through his play ''Fata lui Chir Troanc\u0103'' (\"Kir Troanc\u0103's Daughter\").<ref>Cioculescu, p.181-182</ref> The writer was most likely very familiar with the comedies authored by his two uncles, [[Costache Caragiale|Costache]] and [[Iorgu Caragiale|Iorgu]], which have been shown to develop themes he later explored in depth.<ref>Cazimir (1967), p.73-76</ref> Among the minor 19th century dramatists whose comedic works were familiar to Caragiale, and in many ways similar to his, own was [[Costache Halepliu]].<ref>Cazimir (1967), p.76-79</ref> Another often-cited influence is his predecessor and adversary [[Vasile Alecsandri]], whose ''[[Coana Chiri\u0163a]]'' plays are an early critique of [[Westernization]].<ref name=\"ibrextremacar\"/><ref>Cazimir (1967), p.70-72</ref> The two authors nonetheless differ in many ways, with Caragiale assuming a more complex role, and observing a more complex society.<ref name=\"antohi\"/><ref name=\"zarifintrod\"/><ref name=\"ibrextremacar\"/><ref>Cazimir (1967), p.72; M\u00eendra, p.32</ref>\n\nIon Luca Caragiale is known to have been amused by the [[stock character]] [[Robert Macaire]], at a time when the latter had been turned into a comedic character by [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rick Lema\u00eetre]].<ref>Cazimir (1967), p.102-103</ref> While in [[Berlin]], he purchased the cartoons of French artists [[Honor\u00e9 Daumier]] and [[Paul Gavarni]] (although it is not known if their separate portrayals of Macaire were familiar to him)<ref name=\"Cazimir 1967, p.103-105\">Cazimir (1967), p.103-105</ref>\u2014among these drawings was one showing notabilities embracing one another while picking each other's pockets, which shows similarities with Caragiale's own take on society.<ref>Cazimir (1967), p.104</ref> According to Cazimir, it is possible that he knew Daumier's work from early on, as several other subjects caricatured by the French artist bear a remarkable resemblance to his texts.<ref name=\"Cazimir 1967, p.103-105\"/>\n\nIon Luca Caragiale was also keenly aware and receptive of his contemporaries' works and of ''[[fin de si\u00e8cle]]'' innovations. The literary creations of [[\u00c9mile Zola]] were a noted source of inspiration, and the parallel led [[George C\u0103linescu]] to propose him and [[Barbu \u015etef\u0103nescu Delavrancea]] as the main representatives of Zola's style in local literature.<ref name=\"C\u0103linescu, p.179\"/> At the same time, [[Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea]] believed that both ''[[N\u0103pasta]]'' and ''[[O f\u0103clie de Pa\u015fte]]'' showed the \"obvious enough influence\" of [[Fyodor Dostoevsky]].<ref>{{in lang|ro}} [[Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea]], [http://ro.wikisource.org/wiki/Dl_Panu_asupra_criticii_%C5%9Fi_literaturii ''Dl Panu asupra criticii \u015fi literaturii''] (wikisource)</ref> Late in his life, Caragiale discovered the literature of [[Anatole France]]\u2014according to [[Paul Zarifopol]], France's [[Humanism|Humanist]] themes served as a model for some of Caragiale's [[Fantasy literature|fantasy]] writings.<ref name=\"Vianu, Vol. II, p.195\"/><ref name=\"zarifintrod\"/>\n\nDiscussing the latter works, Vianu noted that they reminded one of [[Shakespeare's late romances]],<ref name=\"Vianu, Vol. II, p.205\"/> while [[\u015eerban Cioculescu]] believed them to have been indirectly inspired by the works of [[Edgar Allan Poe]].<ref name=\"Cioculescu, p.38\"/> In his report for the Academy, [[Dimitrie C. Oll\u0103nescu-Ascanio]] also drew a parallel between Poe's works and ''[[La hanul lui M\u00e2njoal\u0103]]'', but this hypothesis was rejected by Zarifopol.<ref name=\"zarifintrod\"/> In addition, ''[[Kir Ianulea]]'', partly using [[Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli]]'s novel as a source, was held as evidence of Caragiale's interest in [[Renaissance literature]].<ref>Vianu, Vol. I, p.313, 314</ref>\n\n==Cultural legacy==\n\nThe writer's investigations into [[Culture of Romania|Romanian culture]] also resulted in an accurate record of the [[Romanian language]] as it was spoken during his day, sampling [[Romanian dialects|dialects]], [[jargon]], [[slang]], verbal [[tic]]s, as well as illustrating the experiments undertaken by conflicting schools of [[linguistics]] during the 19th and early 20th century, as well as the traces they left on the [[Romanian lexis]].<ref>Vianu, Vol. II, p.203-204, 240\u2013241; Vol.III, p.246</ref> In [[Tudor Vianu]]'s opinion, this was partly owed to his keen musical ear.<ref>Vianu, Vol. II, p.203</ref>\n\nCaragiale was an enduring influence on both [[Romanian humor]] and the views Romanians take of themselves.<ref name=\"boiaborderland\">[[Lucian Boia]], ''Romania: Borderland of Europe'', Reaktion Books, London, 2001, p.247. {{ISBN|1-86189-103-2}}</ref> His comedies and various stories have produced a series of [[catchphrase]]s, many of which are still present in both cultural reference.

They include the [[Comedy|comedies]] ''[[O noapte furtunoas\u0103]]'', ''[[Conu Leonida fa\u0163\u0103 cu reac\u0163iunea]]'', ''[[O scrisoare pierdut\u0103]]'', and the [[tragedy]] ''[[N\u0103pasta]]''. In addition to these, Caragiale authored the [[melodrama]] ''[[O soacr\u0103]]'', a large number of essays, articles, short stories, [[novella]]s and [[Sketch story|sketch stories]], as well as occasional works of poetry and autobiographical texts such as ''[[Din carnetul unui vechi sufleur]]''. In many cases, his creations were first published in one of several magazines he edited\u2014''[[Claponul]]'', ''[[Moftul Rom\u00e2n]]'', ''[[Vatra (literary magazine)|Vatra]]'' and ''[[Epoca (Romania)|Epoca]]''. Most of his prose works have been published under the title ''[[Momente \u015fi schi\u0163e]]'': they include ''[[C\u0103ldur\u0103 mare]]'', ''[[C\u0103nu\u0163\u0103 om sucit]]'', ''[[Dou\u0103 loturi]]'', ''[[Grand Hotel \"Victoria rom\u00e2n\u0103\"]]'', as well as several pieces referring to [[stock character]]s such as [[Lache and Mache]], [[Marius Chico\u015f Rostogan]] and [[Mitic\u0103]]. In some of his later fiction writings, including ''[[La hanul lui M\u00e2njoal\u0103]]'', ''[[Kir Ianulea]]'', ''[[Abu-Hasan]]'', ''[[Pastram\u0103 trufanda]]'' and ''[[Calul dracului]]'', Caragiale adopted the [[Fantasy literature|fantasy]] genre or turned to [[historical fiction]].\n\nIon Luca Caragiale was interested in the politics of the [[Kingdom of Romania|Romanian Kingdom]], and oscillated between the [[Liberalism and radicalism in Romania|liberal current]] and [[conservatism]]. Most of his [[Satire|satirical]] works target the liberal [[Republicanism|republicans]] and the [[National Liberal Party (Romania, 1875)|National Liberals]], evidencing both his respect for their rivals at ''Junimea'' and his connections with the literary critic [[Titu Maiorescu]]. He came to clash with National Liberal leaders such as [[Dimitrie Sturdza]] and [[Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu]], and was a lifelong adversary of the [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist]] poet [[Alexandru Macedonski]]. As a result of these conflicts, the most prominent of [[Criticism of Ion Luca Caragiale|Caragiale's critics]] barred his access to the cultural establishment for several decades. During the 1890s, Caragiale rallied with the [[Radicalism (historical)|radical]] movement of [[George Panu]], before associating with the [[Conservative Party (Romania, 1880\u20131918)|Conservative Party]]. After having decided to settle in [[Berlin]], he came to voice strong criticism for Romanian politicians of all colours in the wake of the [[1907 Romanian Peasants' Revolt]], and ultimately joined the [[Conservative-Democratic Party]].\n\nHe was both a friend and rival to writers such as Eminescu, Maiorescu, and [[Barbu \u015etef\u0103nescu Delavrancea]], while maintaining contacts with, among others, the ''Junimist'' essayist [[Iacob Negruzzi]], the [[Socialism|socialist]] philosopher [[Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea]], the literary critic [[Paul Zarifopol]], the poets [[George Co\u015fbuc]] and [[Mite Kremnitz]], the psychologist [[Constantin R\u0103dulescu-Motru]], and the [[Transylvania]]n poet and activist [[Octavian Goga]]. Ion Luca was the nephew of [[Costache Caragiale|Costache]] and [[Iorgu Caragiale]], who were major figures of mid-19th century Romanian theatre. His sons [[Mateiu Caragiale|Mateiu]] and [[Luca Caragiale|Luca]] were both [[Modernism|modernist]] writers.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Background and name===\nIon Luca Caragiale was born into a family of [[Greeks in Romania|Greek]] descent, whose members first arrived in Wallachia soon after 1812, during the rule of [[List of rulers of Wallachia|Prince]] [[Ioan Gheorghe Caragea]]\u2014\u015etefan Caragiali, as his grandfather was known locally, worked as a cook for the court in [[Bucharest]].<ref name=\"heinischeviasi\">{{in lang|ro}} Rosana Heinisch, [http://www.evenimentul.ro/articol/grecii-mai-interesati-de.html \"Grecii, mai interesa\u0163i de opera lui I.L.Caragiale decit cona\u0163ionalii s\u0103i\"], in ''[[Evenimentul]]'', 8 June 2002</ref><ref name=\"nastasa\">{{in lang|ro}} Lucian Nastas\u0103, [http://www.history-cluj.ro/Istorie/cercet/Nastasa/Despre_genealogie.pdf ''Genealogia \u00eentre \u015ftiin\u0163\u0103, mitologie \u015fi monomanie''], p.18, at the [[Romanian Academy]]'s George Bari\u0163 Institute of History, Cluj-Napoca.

Caragiale turned Aamsky into a character on his own, envisaging his death as a result of overwork in editing magazines \"for the country's political development\".<ref name=\"Cioculescu, p.52\"/>\n\nCaragiale also contributed poetry to ''Ghimpele'': two [[sonnet]]s, and a series of [[epigram]]s (one of which was another attack on Macedonski).<ref>Cioculescu, p.60-61</ref> The first of these works, an 1873 sonnet dedicated to [[baritone]] [[Agostino Mazzoli]], is believed to have been his first contribution to the ''[[belles-lettres]]'' (as opposed to journalism).<ref name=\"danmanuca\"/><ref>Perpessicius, p.50</ref>\n\nIn 1896, Macedonski reflected with irony:\n<blockquote>\"As early as 1872, the clients of some [[beer garden]]s in the capital have had the occasion to welcome among them of a noisy young man, a bizarre spirit who seemed destined, were he to have devoted himself to letters or the arts, to be entirely original.

That is why the success of the [1890 Eminescu edition] has overcome all the editors' expectations\".<ref>Perpessicius, p.138</ref> He also reprinted his recollections from the world of theater, alongside pieces originally published in ''[[Claponul]]'' and various new satirical pieces.<ref name=\"zarifintrod\"/>\n\nAlthough this attack owed much to ''Junimea'''s discourse, Caragiale had by then turned against Maiorescu, probably due to his perception that the society had failed to support his cause at the Academy.<ref>Vianu, Vol. II, p.182-183</ref> In May 1892, he used a public conference at the [[Romanian Athenaeum]] as a venue to make known his claims against the former Minister of Education and his associates, which caused a definitive rift between the two public figures.<ref>Cioculescu, p.21; M\u00eendra, p.274; Ornea, p.200; Vianu, Vol. II, p.183</ref> Caragiale also wrote ''Dou\u0103 note'' (\"Two Notes\"), an article accusing Maiorescu of having modified and censored some of Eminescu's poems, and of having exploited the poet for financial gain.<ref>Ornea, p.200;

Ciupal\u0103, p.104-105</ref> The writer placed the blame for Odobescu's death on his much younger lover, Hortensia Racovi\u0163\u0103, and hailed his wife, Sa\u015fa Odobescu, as a model of devoted womanhood.<ref>Ciupal\u0103, p.104-105</ref>\n\nThis episode of his life coincided with a period when relations between Romania and [[Austria-Hungary]] were extremely tense. Three years before, [[Romanians|ethnic Romanian]] leaders in Austro-Hungarian-ruled Transylvania had signed the ''[[Transylvanian Memorandum]]'', which inflamed passions among the Hungarians and led the authors to be indicted. [[Conservative Party (Romania, 1880\u20131918)|Conservative Party]] politicians in Romania had succeeded in negotiating an [[amnesty]], but their policies were overturned by the National Liberals, who appealed to nationalist and [[Irredentism|irredentist]] sentiment.\n\nThus, Sturdza offered a measure of support to [[Eugen Brote]], ''[[Tribuna (Romania)|Tribuna]]'' editor and [[National Romanian Party]] activist. Brote, who fled Transylvania and planned to directly implicate the [[Kingdom of Romania|Romanian Kingdom]] into the conflict, attempted to replace the pro-Conservative leadership of the National Party with a selection of politicians favored by the National Liberals.<ref name=\"Cioculescu, p.24\">Cioculescu, p.24</ref> As Sturdza came to lead the cabinet, both he and Brote retracted their previous statements, but again provoked the National Party by alleging that its leaders were the actual radicals.<ref name=\"Cioculescu, p.24\"/> In harsh terms, Caragiale exposed the understanding Sturdza had with Brote.<ref>Cioculescu, p.24-25; Vianu, Vol. II, p.185</ref> Soon after, he authored a short story about a con artist who traveled to the imagined Transylvanian town of Opidul-nou, posing as the nationalist Romanian writer [[Alexandru Vlahu\u0163\u0103]] as a means to live off the local [[intelligentsia]].<ref>Cioculescu, p.126; Vianu, Vol. II, p.187</ref> In October 1897, he was outraged by news that Sturdza had given in to Austro-Hungarian demands, and that he had expelled Transylvanian nationalists from Romania: Caragiale held a speech in which he argued that Romanians living abroad were \"indispensable\" to the Romanian state.<ref>Cioculescu, p.125-126</ref>\n\n===''Epoca''===\n[[File:Const Jiquidi - Caragiale leaving Epoca.jpg|thumb|Caragiale as a traveler, parting with ''[[Epoca (Romania)|Epoca]]'' (1890s caricature by [[Constantin Jiquidi]])]]\nIn 1895, the writer followed the Radical group into its unusual merger with the Conservative Party.<ref>Cioculescu, p.25-26;

Ionescu-Caion]], a journalist and student whom [[Tudor Vianu]] described as \"a real pathological character\", issued a claim that, in his ''[[N\u0103pasta]]'', the Romanian dramatist had [[Plagiarism|plagiarized]] the work of a [[Hungarian language|Hungarian-language]] author named Istv\u00e1n Kem\u00e9ny.<ref name=\"danmanuca\"/><ref name=\"Cioculescu, p p.188, 373\">Cioculescu, p.132-133; Vianu, Vol. II, p.188, 373</ref> Caion expanded on this in articles published by ''[[Revista Literar\u0103]]'', where he provided direct comparisons between the two texts.<ref name=\"enemagist\"/><ref name=\"Cioculescu, p p.188, 373\"/> This was received with enthusiasm by Caragiale's old rival, [[Alexandru Macedonski]], who publicized the controversy through one of his journals, ''[[For\u0163a Moral\u0103]]''.<ref>Cioculescu, p.133-140; Vianu, Vol. II, p.188, 373\u2013374, 387</ref> Initially amazed by the similarity between the two texts, Caragiale carried out his own investigations, and, in the end, discovered that neither the writing nor Kem\u00e9ny had ever existed.<ref>Cioculescu, p.133; Vianu, Vol. II, p.188, 373</ref> Employing \u015etef\u0103nescu Delavrancea as his lawyer, he brought Caion to trial: a court sentenced Caion for [[calumny]], but he was [[Acquittal|acquitted]] after an [[appeal]] in June 1902.<ref name=\"enemagist\"/><ref>Cioculescu, p.124, 133; M\u00eendra, p.16, 274; Vianu, Vol. II, p.188</ref> Several commentators believe that this was owed to a strong National Liberal presence among members of the jury.<ref name=\"enemagist\"/><ref name=\"Cioculescu, p.124\"/> During the retrial, Caion retracted all his previous claims, and instead argued that ''N\u0103pasta'' plagiarized [[Leo Tolstoy]]'s ''[[The Power of Darkness]]''.<ref>Cioculescu, p.133</ref>\n\nMacedonski supported the lost cause until the very end, and refused to distance himself from Caion even as the latter admitted to the court that he had invented the story.<ref>Cioculescu, p.133-140; Vianu, Vol. II, p.374</ref> His magazine also accused Caragiale of having copied [[Victorien Sardou]]'s ''Rabagas'' for his ''[[O scrisoare pierdut\u0103]]'', as well as [[Henri Chivot]] and [[Alfred Duru]]'s ''Le Carnaval d'un Merle Blanc'' in ''[[D-ale carnavalului]]''.<ref>Cazimir (1967), p.100-101; Cioculescu, p.136-137</ref> In one memorable incident of 14 February 1902, while he was hosting a literary festivity at the [[Romanian Athenaeum|Bucharest Athenaeum]], Macedonski was heckled<ref>Cioculescu, p.137; Vianu, Vol. II, p.374</ref> and responded by blowing a whistle.<ref name=\"Vianu, Vol. II, p.374\">Vianu, Vol. II, p.374</ref> ''For\u0163a Moral\u0103'' was shut down soon after this episode.<ref name=\"Vianu, Vol. II, p.374\"/> In parallel, the National Theater offered Caragiale a degree of satisfaction, when it decided to showcase ''Rabagas'', leaving the public to see that it was only remotely similar to his play.<ref>Cioculescu, p.137-138</ref>\n\nIn the wake of the scandal, Caragiale attempted to resume contacts with Maiorescu, and visited him several times. His former mentor was reticent, and finally rejected the offer for reconciliation \u2013 writing in his diary, he defined Caragiale's attempts as \"apple-polishings\" and ''parad\u0103ri'' (\"affectations\").<ref name=\"Ornea, p.200\"/>\n\n===Move to Berlin===\nHaving gained access to the Momulo Cardini inheritance, Caragiale became a rather wealthy man.<ref name=\"enemagist\"/><ref name=\"danmanuca\"/><ref>Cioculescu, p.308; Vianu, Vol. II, p.188</ref> According to [[\u015eerban Cioculescu]], the writer soon lost most of the funds earned, transferring them to [[Mateiu Caragiale]] and his mother, but was again made rich by the death of his sister Lenci in autumn 1905\u2014she left him the administrator of 160,000 [[Romanian leu|lei]].<ref>Cioculescu, p.308, 362</ref> The latter event caused tensions between Mateiu and his father\u2014Caragiale-son believed that he had been cheated out of the inheritance, and was angered by Ion Luca's decision to stop subsidizing him after he failed to complete his studies.<ref>Cioculescu, p.352, 357\u2013358, 360\u2013362, 363\u2013364</ref>\n\nHe was by then enchanted with the idea of moving into a [[Western Europe|Western]] or [[Central Europe]]an country, where he hoped to lead a more comfortable life and be closer to the centers of culture.<ref>Vianu, Vol. II, p.188, 198\u2013199</ref> He was especially interested in gaining easier access to the major stages for [[classical music]], as a means to satisfy his desire for quality in that field<ref name=\"Vianu, Vol. II, p.188\"/> (he had by then come to adore the compositions of [[Ludwig van Beethoven]]).<ref>Cioculescu, p.222-231; Vianu, Vol. II, p.203</ref> According to Tudor Vianu, Caragiale was also showing signs that he was about to enter a vaguely [[misanthropic]] phase of his life.<ref name=\"Vianu, Vol. II, p.188\"/>\n\nIn 1903\u20131904, the Caragiales traveled through various European countries, while the dramatist again considered establishing his residence in Transylvania.<ref name=\"enemagist\"/><ref name=\"Cioculescu, p.308\">Cioculescu, p.308</ref> They eventually moved to [[Berlin]], the [[German Empire|Imperial German]] capital, settling down in spring 1905.<ref name=\"danmanuca\"/><ref>Cioculescu, p.308; Vianu, Vol. II, p.188, 198</ref> The choice was considered unusual, since the writer knew only some basic [[German language|German]] expressions.<ref name=\"blagarol\">{{in lang|ro}} Iulia Blaga, [http://www.romanialibera.ro/a89620/casele-lui-i-l-caragiale-de-la-berlin.html \"Casele lui I.L.

Or\u0103\u015fanu]]; without making direct references to the monarch, it features the lyrics ''Ca rol fu mare, mititelul'' (\"Taking in view his role, he was grand, the little one\"), with \"ca\" and \"rol\" spelling out his name (and thus allowing the poem to read \"Carol was grand, the little one\").<ref>Cioculescu, p.68</ref> He continued to publish various works in several other newspapers and magazines, including various Tranylvanian papers and the Ia\u015fi-based ''[[Via\u0163a Rom\u00e2neasc\u0103]]''.<ref name=\"zarifintrod\"/>\n\nHis subsequent work comprised mostly correspondence with other literary figures, such as Dobrogeanu-Gherea, Mihail Dragomirescu, [[Alceu Urechia]], and Zarifopol.<ref>Cioculescu, p.94-95, 117\u2013119, 120, 122\u2013123, 208\u2013311;

Ornea, p.228</ref>\n\n===1907===\nIn 1907, Caragiale was shaken by the outbreak and violent repression of the [[1907 Romanian Peasants' Revolt|Romanian Peasants' Revolt]], and decided to write a lengthy essay, in which he condemned the agrarian policies of both National Liberal and Conservative governments from a [[Patriotism|patriotic]] perspective.<ref name=\"danmanuca\"/><ref>Cioculescu, p.28-29, 119\u2013124; Ornea, p.228; Vianu, Vol. II, p.189</ref> According to Vianu, the resulting ''1907, din prim\u0103var\u0103 p\u00e2n\u0103 \u00een toamn\u0103'' (\"1907, From Spring to Autumn\") was, alongside earlier essays by Eminescu and Maiorescu, the most important works of social analysis to be written by that generation.<ref>Vianu, Vol. II, p.189</ref>\n\nThe essay, written in harsh tones, listed what Caragiale saw as the major social problems tolerated by Romanian administrations: he discussed the landowning class, successor to the [[boyar]]s, having maintained as much possible from the legacy of [[serfdom]]; he noted that, while the commerce was dominated by foreigners, the administration was gripped by a no longer aristocratic [[oligarchy]] and its far-reaching [[political machine]].<ref>Cioculescu, p.28-29, 121, 123, 268\u2013271; Vianu, Vol. II, p.189-190</ref> As several commentators noted, many of the topics brought up by Caragiale built on the critical overview adopted by ''Junimea''.<ref>Ornea, p.228; Vianu, Vol. II, p.190</ref> To the social and political problems, the text offered a [[Monarchism|monarchist]] solution\u2014Caragiale expected Carol I to carry out a ''[[coup d'\u00e9tat]]'' against the Romanian political establishment, replacing the [[1866 Constitution of Romania|Constitution of 1866]], which left some room for [[Privilege (legal ethics)|privilege]] through the [[census suffrage]], with a more [[Democracy|democratic]] one.<ref>Cioculescu, p.301;

Vianu, Vol. II, p.189</ref> The author had agreed to make himself known after ''Die Zeit'' reached Romania and had caused the local press to wonder who had condemned the system in such harsh words.<ref>Cioculescu, p.123-124</ref>\n\nThe brochure attracted instantaneous attention in his native country, and its success was notable: it sold around 13,000 copies.<ref>Cioculescu, p.28, 260\u2013261, 301</ref> There were notable differences between the two versions, which were the result of Caragiale's answer to criticism and suggestions from [[Christian Rakovsky]], a prominent [[Proletarian internationalism|internationalist]] socialist who had been expelled from Romania early in the year.<ref>Cioculescu, p.28, 46</ref> Caragiale elaborated on some of the essay's themes in a series of [[fable]]s he published soon after.<ref>Cioculescu, p.28, 47\u201348, 268</ref>\n\nThis chain of events prompted [[Barbu \u015etef\u0103nescu Delavrancea]] to offer him a position in the Conservative Party, as a means to reform the system from within.<ref>Cioculescu, p.304; Vianu, Vol. II, p.191</ref> Caragiale rejected the offer: by then, he had grown disillusioned with the traditional political groupings, and had decided to sever all his links with them.<ref>Cioculescu, p.27-28, 29\u201330; Vianu, Vol. II, p.191</ref> Instead, in 1908, he joined the [[Conservative-Democratic Party]], a rising force of the entrepreneurial [[middle class]], led by [[Take Ionescu]].<ref>Cioculescu, p.29-30, 271\u2013273; Ornea, p.208; Vianu, Vol. II, p.191</ref> He briefly returned to Romania several times after 1908, campaigning in favor of the Ionescu and being himself proposed for a seat in the [[Chamber of Deputies of Romania|Chamber of Deputies]] (before the Conservative-Democrats decided another person was more suited for the position).<ref>Cioculescu, p.272-273; Ornea, p.208; Vianu, Vol. II, p.191, 192</ref> His involvement in politics engendered a collateral conflict with his son Mateiu, after the latter expressed a wish to become part of the administration (a project ridiculed by Caragiale-father).<ref>Cioculescu, p.365, 368</ref>\n\nIn December 1907, after ''Opinia'' became a mouthpiece of Ionescu's party, Caragiale received news that its headquarters had been vandalized by [[A. C. Cuza]] and his [[Nationalism|nationalist]] supporters (who were students at the [[University of Ia\u015fi]]). Just days after, when Cuza's group offered to host a Caragiale festival, he refused to participate, citing his respect for the [[freedom of the press]].<ref>Cioculescu, p.14-16</ref> It was also during the period that he published his ''[[Din carnetul unui vechi sufleur]]'', grouping short pieces about cultural figures such as [[Iorgu Caragiale]], [[Pantazi Ghica]], and [[Matei Millo]].\n\n===Final years===\n[[File:Alexandru Davila si Ion Luca Caragiale.jpg|thumb|[[Alexandru Davila]] and Ion Luca Caragiale]]\n[[File:Ion Luca Caragiale 2.jpg|thumb|Ion Luca Caragiale c. 1912]]\nBeginning in 1909, Caragiale resumed his contributions to ''[[Universul]]''.<ref>Vianu, Vol. II, p.191</ref> The same year, his [[Fantasy literature|fantasy]] piece ''[[Kir Ianulea]]'', which explored the [[history of Bucharest]] during the early 19th century and the late stages of the [[Phanariotes|Phanariote]] period, was published by ''[[Via\u0163a Rom\u00e2neasc\u0103]]''.<ref>Vianu, Vol. I, p.313; Vol. II, p.191, 205</ref> The novella partly built on ''[[Belfagor arcidiavolo]]'', by [[Renaissance literature|Renaissance]] author [[Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli]],<ref>C\u0103linescu, p.181-182; Cioculescu, p.203-207, 262; Vianu, Vol. I, p.313</ref> and was occasionally classified as an example of [[historical fiction]].<ref name=\"zarifintrod\"/> Similar stories use themes from the ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'' (''[[Abu-Hasan]]'') and popular anecdotes (''[[Pastram\u0103 trufanda]]'').<ref name=\"C\u0103linescu, p.181\">C\u0103linescu, p.181</ref> Another work of the time was ''[[Calul dracului]]'', a rural-themed account of demonic temptation, which Vianu called \"one of the most perfect short stories to have been written in Romanian language\".<ref>Vianu, Vol.I, p.313-314; Vol. II, p.205</ref>\n\nHis last collection of writings, titled ''Schi\u0163e nou\u0103'' (\"New Sketches\") saw print in 1910.<ref name=\"zarifintrod\"/><ref name=\"M\u00eendra, p.25\">M\u00eendra, p.25</ref> During that period, after giving endorsement to a project outlined by his fellow dramatist [[Alexandru Davila]], he aided in the creation of a new privately run Bucharest theater, and recorded its inauguration in his [[reportage]] ''\u00cencepem'' (\"We Begin\").<ref name=\"M\u00eendra, p.25\"/>\n\nBy that time, Ion Luca Caragiale became remarkably close to a new generation of ethnic Romanian intellectuals in [[Austria-Hungary]]. In 1909, he recalled the union of the two [[Danubian Principalities]] under [[Alexander John Cuza]], and predicted the [[union of Transylvania with Romania]].<ref>Cioculescu, p.126-127; Vianu, Vol. II, p.192</ref> He visited [[Budapest]] to meet with Transylvanian students at the [[E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd University|local university]], and was the subject of a [[PhD]] thesis authored by [[Horia Petra-Petrescu]] (which was also the first [[monograph]] on his work).<ref>Cioculescu, p.250;

Cioculescu, p.16; Vianu, Vol. II, p.65</ref>\n\nThrough many of his traits, Caragiale was connected to a [[Balkans|Balkan]] environment of virtually permanent human contact, with its humor condensed in [[anecdote]]s, mimicry, and witty comebacks.<ref>C\u0103linescu, p.181; Vianu, Vol. I, p.307-308; Vol. II, p.195</ref> Zarifopol quoted him saying that he admired the traditional forms of entertainment, and that he admired the ''soitar\u00eci'' (\"[[buffoon]]s\").<ref name=\"zarifpubl\"/><ref>Cazimir (1967), p.46-48</ref>\n\nLargely reflecting his primordial study of [[dramaturgy]], Caragiale's literature is indebted to dialog, as well as, in rarer cases, to [[internal monologue]] and [[free indirect speech]] (the favorite technique of Naturalists).<ref>Vianu, Vol.I, p.311; Vol. II, p.204</ref> Language takes the central role in his work, often compensating for the lack of detail.<ref name=\"zarifintrod\"/><ref>M\u00eendra, p.270; Vianu, Vol.I, p.311; Vol. II, p.203-204</ref> To this was added his tendency to reduce texts to their essence\u2014he shortened down not only his own text, but also his occasional translations of stories by [[Elisabeth of Wied|Queen Elisabeth]] and even [[Miguel de Cervantes]] or [[Edgar Allan Poe]].<ref name=\"zarifintrod\"/> At times, he added a lyrical, meditative or autobiographical, perspective to his works: this trait was especially obvious in his later [[fantasy]] works (''[[Kir Ianulea]]'' and ''[[Calul dracului]]'' among them), all marked by [[Neo-romanticism|Neoromantic]] inspiration.<ref name=\"zarifintrod\"/><ref name=\"Vianu, Vol. II, p.205\">Vianu, Vol. II, p.205</ref> Zarifopol claimed that, although Caragiale often rejected the tendency of other writers to capitalize on [[picturesque]] images, he often used them in his own writings.<ref name=\"zarifintrod\"/>\n\nCaragiale arguably won as much acclaim for his rigorous approach to playwriting as for his accomplished style. With [[Alexandru Vlahu\u0163\u0103]], [[George Co\u015fbuc]] and others, he belonged to the first generation of Romanian authors to take a noted interest in imposing [[professionalism]].<ref>Vianu, Vol. III, p.14</ref> He was specific about this requirement\u2014on one occasion, he used sarcasm to overturn a common misconception, saying: \"Literature is an art that needs not be learned; whoever knows how to turn letters into syllables and the latter into words has had sufficient preparation to engage in literature.\"<ref name=\"Vianu, Vol. II, p.205\"/> Commenting on this, Vianu stressed: \"[...] even under the appearance of ease, [Caragiale] lets us catch sight of the severe law of his art\"<ref>Vianu, Vol. II, p.206</ref> (adding elsewhere that \"[Caragiale] was a scrupulous and tormented artist\").<ref>Vianu, Vol. I, p.314</ref>\n\nCaragiale compared writers who could not dissimulate their intent and generate a good story with \"a [[Strabismus|cross-eyed]] who tells you which way to go: one doesn't known if he is to go down the road he points to, or down the road he is looking at\".<ref name=\"zarifintrod\"/> Speaking in the late 1890s, he also likened writing for the stage with [[architecture]]:\n<blockquote>\"In truth, just as much as the architect's plan is not yet the final accomplishment of his intent\u2014that is to say, the monument\u2014but only its conventional recording [...], so too is the dramaturg's writing not yet the accomplishment of his intent\u2014that is to say, the comedy\u2014but the conventional recording, to which will be added the personal elements, in order to depict a development of human circumstances and deeds. In short: just as an architect's plan bears little resemblance to a painting, so does drama bear little resemblance to a poem.\"<ref name=\"Vianu, Vol. II, p.187\"/></blockquote>\n\n==Political and social vision==\n\n===Liberalism and republicanism===\n[[File:CuzaGhimpele1872.PNG|thumb|Anti-dynasty cartoon, published in ''[[Ghimpele]]'' in 1872, and illustrating the differences of opinion inside the [[Liberalism and radicalism in Romania|liberal camp]]. Left panel: [[Alexander John Cuza]] betrayed by [[Ion Br\u0103tianu]]; right panel: [[Carol I of Romania|Carol I]], supported by [[Otto von Bismarck]] and Br\u0103tianu, feeding off of [[German Empire|German]] influence and economic privilege]]\nHis interest in first-hand investigation of the human nature was accompanied, at least after he reached maturity, by a distaste for generous and [[Universalism|universalist]] theories.<ref>Cioculescu, p.9; Vianu, Vol. II, p.193-194, 196</ref> Caragiale viewed their impact on Romanian society with a critical eye. Like ''[[Junimea]]'', he was amused by the cultural legacy of [[Wallachian Revolution of 1848|1848 Wallachian revolutionaries]], and by its image in National Liberal discourse. Nevertheless, he claimed that there was a clear difference between the first generation of [[Liberalism and radicalism in Romania|liberal activists]]\u2014[[Ion C\u00e2mpineanu]], [[Ion Heliade R\u0103dulescu]], and [[Nicolae B\u0103lcescu]]\u2014and the new liberal establishment, which, as he believed, had come to cultivate [[hypocrisy]], [[demagogy]], and [[political corruption]].<ref>Ornea, p.202-204, 228</ref> He exemplified the latter group by citing some of its prominent members: [[Pantazi Ghica]], [[Nicolae Misail]] and [[Mihail P\u0103t\u00e2rl\u0103geanu]].<ref>Ornea, p.203</ref> At one point, he argued that, had they not died young, the leaders of 1848 could have found themselves best represented by the [[Conservative Party (Romania, 1880\u20131918)|Conservatives]].<ref>Ornea, p.202-203</ref> He recorded the way in which National Liberal politicians claimed to take inspiration from the revolt, and pointed out that the 1848 slogans had become rallying calls for the most banal causes.<ref>Vianu, Vol. I, p.167, 308\u2013309</ref>\n\nHis almost lifelong critique of the liberal current, marked by his conflicts with [[Dimitrie Sturdza]] and [[Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu]], was partly inspired by ''Junimea'''s guidelines\u2014in line with the ''Junimists'', Caragiale perceived liberals as agents of [[Populism]], popular Romanticism, and [[Idealism]], as tenets prevalent in the literature of his day.<ref name=\"Cioculescu, p.9\">Cioculescu, p.9</ref> For Caragiale, the resulting liberal-inspired literary works were ''spanac'' (\"[[spinach]]\").<ref>Cioculescu, p.9, 264</ref> The writer thus identified late 19th-century Romanian liberalism \"empty talk\", and his attacks on demagogy partly mirrored Maiorescu's views about the National Liberals' \"inebriation with words\".<ref>Ornea, p.205, 211, 291</ref>\n\nCaragiale centered some of his first attacks on the \"Reds\" and their leader [[C. A. Rosetti]], in whose [[republicanism]] and inflammatory rhetoric he saw the main threat to Romanian society.<ref name=\"ibrextremacar\"/><ref>Cioculescu, p.179-180; Ornea, p.209-217</ref> The writer believed that, ever since having ousted [[Alexander John Cuza]] from his throne, both Rosetti and [[Ion Br\u0103tianu]] were using their republican basis as an asset, inciting to rebellion only when their demands were not met.<ref>Ornea, p.211-213</ref> He frequently ridiculed the cult with which Rosetti surrounded figures of international republicanism, such as [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] and [[L\u00e9on Gambetta]], and indicated that the National Liberal public had very vague and impractical notions of what a republican state actually implied.<ref name=\"ibrextremacar\"/><ref>Ornea, p.210-217</ref>\n\nThe republican agitation is no longer emphasized in Caragiale's later works, as republicanism slowly faded out of the mainstream liberal discourse.<ref>Ornea, p.212</ref> Noting this, several critics believe that, in his ''[[O scrisoare pierdut\u0103]]'', which depicts the battle between two unnamed political camps, the dramatist alluded to the conflict between Br\u0103tianu's moderates and Rosetti's extremists (as indicated by the fact that all the main characters attend the same rallies).<ref name=\"ibrextremacar\"/><ref>Ornea, p.217-218</ref> This view was disputed by Zarifopol, who argued that the more pragmatic grouping stands for the Conservatives, and the demagogic one for the National Liberals as a whole.<ref>Ornea, p.217</ref>\n\n===Nationalism===\nIon Luca Caragiale was a vocal critic of [[antisemitism]], which was mostly represented by the National Liberals and [[A. C. Cuza]]'s emerging movement. At a time when the [[History of the Jews in Romania|Jewish community]] was denied [[Jewish Emancipation|emancipation]], he advocated its full integration into Romanian society, calling for [[civil rights]] to be extended to all residents of Romania. Around 1907, he tried his hand at writing a legislative proposal, according to which the Romanian state was to extend citizenship all resident [[stateless person]]s who did not enjoy foreign protection\u2014in its manuscript form, this document was kept by his friend [[Dimitrie Gusti]].<ref>Cioculescu, p.30-31</ref> According to [[Garabet Ibr\u0103ileanu]], his rejection of antisemitic views was owed either to his failure to relate with the [[middle class]] and its anti-Jewish stances, or to his \"powerful intelligence\", which contrasted with the \"instinctual, almost zoological nature\" of the antisemitic discourse.<ref name=\"ibrextremacar\"/>\n\nHis criticism of both the nationalist discourse and liberal-inspired education generated subjects for several of his shorter satirical writings. Caragiale thus authored a mock-pamphlet advertising the program of a new cultural society, ''[[Rom\u00e2nii Verzi]]'' (the \"Green Romanians\"), who took its [[Racism|racialist]] proposals to the point of arguing that \"[...] a nation must always fear other nations\".<ref>Ornea, p.224</ref> Like ''Junimea'', he was entirely opposed to the group of [[August Treboniu Laurian]] and other [[Transylvania]]n intellectuals, who attempted to reform the [[Romanian language]] by introducing new forms of speech and writing that aimed to return it closer to its [[Latin]] roots. In his stories, Caragiale created the teacher [[Marius Chico\u015f Rostogan]], a caricature of both the liberal educators and the Transylvanian \"Latinists\".<ref name=\"Ornea, p.226\">Ornea, p.226</ref> While in [[Berlin]], the writer also persiflaged some of [[Vasile Alecsandri]]'s liberal and [[Patriotism|patriotic]] writings\u2014he completed Alecsandri's nationalist poem ''Tricolorul'' with sarcastic verses that were meant to enhance its [[Xenophobia|xenophobic]] feel (showing the Romanians ready to do battle against all their perceived enemies in [[Eastern Europe]]).<ref>Cioculescu, p.68, 216, 252\u2013253</ref>\n\nNevertheless, various authors believe that a young Caragiale did indeed support nationalist liberal policies, and presume that he was behind a series of anti-Jewish columns, published by ''[[Voin\u0163a Na\u0163ional\u0103]]'' during the early 1880s.<ref name=\"Cioculescu, p.9\"/> This was for long disputed: [[rabbi]] and literary historian [[Moses Gaster]] attributed the pieces to [[Nicolae Xenopol]], while researcher [[\u015eerban Cioculescu]], who originally doubted them, eventually agreed that they formed an integral part of Caragiale's work.<ref name=\"Cioculescu, p.21\"/>\n\n===Conservatism and traditionalism===\n[[File:Caragiale and Vlahuta.jpeg|thumb|Caragiale (left) and [[Alexandru Vlahu\u0163\u0103]]]]\nIn some of his early articles, and again as he distanced himself from ''Junimea'', the writer showed himself to be a vocal critic of the Conservative doctrine and its ''Junimist'' representatives. This is especially evident in his 1907 essay and in some of his stories.<ref>Ornea, p.228-229</ref> Caragiale claimed that both [[Titu Maiorescu]] and [[Petre P. Carp]] were \"[[boyar]]s\" who prioritized the interest of their [[social class]] (which was by then nonetheless defunct, as traditional [[Privilege (legal ethics)|privilege]] had been formally abolished a generation earlier).<ref>Cioculescu, p.22-23, 29, 121, 304</ref> Cioculescu attributed this to an \"[[inferiority complex]]\" Caragiale felt in respect to his former patrons.<ref name=\"Cioculescu, p.22\">Cioculescu, p.22</ref>\n\nDespite his brief association with the mainstream Conservatives, Caragiale was probably never their partisan, and only hoped that the party could open the way for the reforms advertised by [[George Panu]] and [[Alexandru Lahovari]].<ref>Cioculescu, p.269, 271; Ornea, p.206-209</ref> When disappointed with their failure to promote change, he moved on to support [[Take Ionescu]] and his dissident grouping.<ref>Cioculescu, p.271-273; Ornea, p.208</ref> Uniquely among students of Caragiale's work, [[George C\u0103linescu]] argued that the writer's main interest was not in criticizing the liberals, but actually in an overall rejection of the most embedded ''Junimist'' tenets, which, in C\u0103linescu's view, had engendered \"a lack of faith in the country's own powers\".<ref>Cazimir (1967), p.54</ref> [[Paul Zarifopol]] believed that several of his ''[[Momente \u015fi schi\u0163e]]'' characters, including the effeminate high life chronicler Edgar Bostandaki, are caricatures of the Conservatives.<ref name=\"zarifpubl\"/>\n\nCaragiale contrasted the other major writers of his generation, including his friends Mihai Eminescu, [[Ioan Slavici]], [[Barbu \u015etef\u0103nescu Delavrancea]], and ''[[S\u0103m\u0103n\u0103torul]]'' journal founder [[Alexandru Vlahu\u0163\u0103]], all of whom were advocating a return to the rural sphere and peasant traditionalism.<ref>Vianu, Vol.I, p.312; Vol. II, p.184, 199</ref> In ''[[Moftul Rom\u00e2n]]'', he [[Parody|parodied]] the [[archaism]]s favored by \u015etef\u0103nescu Delavrancea;<ref>Cioculescu, p.41-43; Vianu, Vol. II, p.185</ref> during his final years, he also questioned the aesthetic value of \u015etef\u0103nescu Delavrancea's medieval-themed play ''[[Apus de soare]]''.<ref>Cioculescu, p.253</ref> Prominent nationalists and traditionalists tended to be reserved in their assessment of Caragiale's literary contributions\u2014they include his friend Eminescu<ref name=\"Cioculescu, p.6\"/> and historian [[Nicolae Iorga]].<ref>Cioculescu, p.28, 305</ref>\n\nNonetheless, Ion Luca Caragiale was, according to Zarifopol, a passionate advocate of tradition in front of innovation, and \"a defender of the well-established truths\".<ref name=\"zarifintrod\"/> [[Tudor Vianu]] also evidenced that Caragiale treasured his [[Romanian Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] identity, frequently appealing to God and the saints in both his private life and his writings.<ref name=\"Vianu, Vol. II, p.197\">Vianu, Vol. II, p.197</ref> According to [[Ioan Slavici]], Caragiale defined himself as \"a right-believing [[Christianity|Christian]]\", and disagreed with Eminescu on the nature of religion (at a time when the poet was a passionate student of [[Buddhism]]).<ref name=\"Vianu, Vol. II, p.197\"/> Cioculescu called this trait \"primitive religiosity\".<ref name=\"Cioculescu, p.7\">Cioculescu, p.7</ref> The writer is also known to have convinced that [[luck]] and [[destiny]] manifested themselves in life,<ref>C\u0103linescu, p.180; Cioculescu, p.7; Vianu, Vol. II, p.204</ref> and his ''[[C\u0103nu\u0163\u0103 om sucit]]'', a short story about a proverbially unlucky fellow, is thought to have referred to its author.<ref>C\u0103linescu, p.180; Vianu, Vol. II, p.204</ref> His [[superstition]]s were accompanied by a series of [[phobia]]s, particularly [[pyrophobia]] and [[nosophobia]].<ref name=\"Cioculescu, p.7\"/>\n\n===Caragiale and the modernists===\nIon Luca Caragiale was mostly critical of literary experiments and the newer stages of [[Modernism]]. On this basis, he persistently ridiculed [[Alexandru Macedonski]]'s style, especially after the latter adopted [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]]. Much of his own poetry, especially pieces published in ''[[Moftul Rom\u00e2n]]'' after 1901, parodied the [[Symbolist movement in Romania|Romanian Symbolist clubs]] and the [[Parnassianism]] of Macedonski's ''[[Literatorul]]''<ref>Cioculescu, p.63-64, 67, 134</ref> (among the best-known of these targets was poet [[Cincinat Pavelescu]], who was coeditor at ''Literatorul'').<ref>Cioculescu, p.134</ref>\n\nAs editor of ''[[Epoca (Romania)|Epoca]]'''s literary supplement, Caragiale refused to publish a descriptive poem by the young [[Gala Galaction]], claiming that it was not poetry (when [[Nicolae Filipescu]] asked him to reconsider, he threatened to quit).<ref>Vianu, Vol. III, p.281</ref> Late in his life, he reserved explicit criticism for the new generation of Symbolists, whose work, he argued, belonged to \"the church\" of [[Belgium|Belgian]] poet [[Maurice Maeterlinck]].<ref>Cioculescu, p.67</ref> Zarifopol also noted that, for as long as he lived, the writer derided the innovative works of [[Henrik Ibsen]] and [[August Strindberg]], but pointed out that Caragiale had never actually read or seen their plays.<ref name=\"zarifintrod\"/>\n\nNevertheless, Caragiale was not entirely opposed to newer trends in poetry and art. Literary critic [[Matei C\u0103linescu]] believes that he genuinely admired ''\u00cen ora\u015ful cu trei sute de biserici'' (\"In the City with Three Hundred Churches\"), a [[free verse]] poem by the Symbolist [[Ion Minulescu]].<ref name=\"mateicalinescu\">[[Matei C\u0103linescu]], \"Prefa\u0163\u0103\", in [[Ion Minulescu]], ''Roman\u0163e pentru mai t\u00e2rziu \u015fi alte poezii'', [[Editura pentru literatur\u0103]], Bucharest, 1967, p.XIV. {{OCLC|6434366}}</ref> This work is believed to have inspired a 1908 parody by Caragiale, in which the writer proclaimed his support for Take Ionescu.<ref name=\"mateicalinescu\"/><ref>Cioculescu, p.66</ref> According to poet and essayist [[Tudor Arghezi]], Caragiale also admired the works of [[\u015etefan Luchian]], a [[Postimpressionism|Postimpressionist]] whose paintings were often exhibited in Bucharest galleries.<ref>[[Tudor Arghezi]], ''Scrieri. Proze'', [[Editura Minerva]], Bucharest, 1985, p.621. {{OCLC|32599658}}</ref>\n\n===Caragiale and the Left===\nMoving toward the [[Left-wing politics|Left]] during the final decades of his life, the writer maintained connection with the [[Socialism|socialists]], but was nonetheless ambivalent to their goals. As Cioculescu noted, he welcomed the Bucharest celebration of [[May Day]] in one of his ''[[Moftul Rom\u00e2n]]'' pieces,<ref name=\"Cioculescu, p.22\"/> and probably agreed to lecture for the Workers' Club in the capital.<ref name=\"ibrextremacar\"/><ref name=\"Cioculescu, p.22\"/> Some of his writings were hosted by the socialist journal ''[[Rom\u00e2nia Muncitoare]]''.<ref>M\u00eendra, p.11</ref> According to [[Garabet Ibr\u0103ileanu]], himself a socialist at the time, \"sometime after 1890, Caragiale briefly flirted with socialism.\"<ref name=\"ibrextremacar\"/>\n\nHowever, over the same period, Caragiale ridiculed several socialist militants, referring to one of their leaders with the derisive nickname ''Edgard Spanachidi'' (itself a derivative of \"spinach\").<ref>Cioculescu, p.22, 64</ref> Instead, his loose association with [[George Panu]] signified a return to [[Radicalism (historical)|radicalism]], and saw him campaigning in favor of [[universal suffrage]] and a complete [[land reform]]<ref>Cioculescu, p.23, 46\u201347; Ornea, p.208-209</ref>\u2014this clashed with the views he had expressed earlier in life, and Caragiale was careful not to let it seem that he had returned to the \"Red\" liberalism of his youth.<ref>Ornea, p.209</ref>\n\nIn one of his articles, Ion Luca Caragiale commented with irony on the [[Marxism|Marxist]] views of his friend [[Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea]]: he compared the latter's way of dining on a leg of veal, laboriously carving it into sections, to his philosophical approach. Caragiale thus noted that [[philosophical skepticism]] was equivalent to stripping the bone of its flesh piece by piece, and then throwing it to the dogs\u2014without having been able to fully document the leg of veal or its substance.<ref>Vianu, Vol. II, p.194</ref> Nevertheless, as Tudor Vianu indicated, although Caragiale preferred observation and spontaneity to speculation, he was not averse to pure philosophical analysis, and frequently quoted the [[classics]] in defense of his aesthetic guidelines.<ref>Vianu, Vol. II, p.194-195</ref> Late in his life, Caragiale also sparked debates after deriding the emerging [[Poporanism]], a school of thought which took its inspiration from socialism, [[agrarianism]] and traditionalism.<ref>Cioculescu, p.43, 67</ref> He is also known to have been amused by the [[1907 German federal election|German election of 1907]] and the resulting defeat registered by the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party]].<ref>Cioculescu, p.271</ref>\n\nCaragiale maintained a friendship with Dobrogeanu-Gherea for much of his life. He was especially interested in news of Dobrogeanu-Gherea having become involved in the 1905 [[Russian battleship Potemkin]] scandal, after the aging socialist decided to offer his help to the refugee sailors as they arrived in [[Constan\u0163a]].<ref>Cioculescu, p.243-246</ref> During his time in [[Berlin]], he repeatedly tried to convince the Dobrogeanu-Ghereas to leave their home in Romania and join him abroad.<ref>Cioculescu, p.240</ref> Nonetheless, he criticized the philosopher when the latter refused to be decorated by [[King of Romania|King]] [[Carol I of Romania|Carol I]] (1909).<ref>Cioculescu, p.245-246</ref> Around 1907, the dramatist was also interested in the activities of [[Christian Rakovsky]], who was trying to make his way back into Romania, and closely followed news of street clashes between his supporters and the authorities.<ref>Cioculescu, p.246-248</ref>\n\n==Settings==\n[[File:Sinaia Prahova old pic.jpg|thumb|Early 20th century panorama of [[Sinaia]]]]\nThe writer had an unprecedented familiarity with the social environments, traits, opinions, manners of speech, means of expression and lifestyle choices of his day\u2014from the rural atmosphere of his early childhood, going through his vast experience as a journalist, to the high spheres of politics ([[National Liberal Party (Romania, 1875)|National Liberal]] as well as [[Conservative Party (Romania, 1880\u20131918)|Conservative]], ''Junimist'' as well as socialist).<ref>Cioculescu, p.6, 7\u20138; Vianu, Vol. II, p.193</ref> An incessant traveler, Caragiale carefully investigated everyday life in most areas of the [[Romanian Old Kingdom]] and Transylvania.<ref>Vianu, Vol. II, p.193</ref> He was an unusually sociable man:<ref name=\"zarifpubl\"/><ref>Cioculescu, p.118</ref> in one of his letters from [[Berlin]], he asked [[Alceu Urechia]] to send his regards to over 40 of his acquaintances in [[Sinaia]] (from [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] diplomats to street vendors or beggars).<ref>Cioculescu, p.118-119</ref>\n\nSeveral of his major works have a rural setting\u2014they include ''[[N\u0103pasta]]'', ''[[\u00cen vreme de r\u0103zboi]]'', ''[[La hanul lui M\u00e2njoal\u0103]]'', ''[[Calul dracului]]'', ''[[P\u0103cat]]'', and ''[[O f\u0103clie de Pa\u015fte]]'', as well as fragments of the pseudo-[[fairy tale]]s he authored late in life.<ref>Vianu, Vol.I, p.312, 313\u2013314; Vol. II, p.198, 205</ref> Nevertheless, Caragiale is foremost known and acclaimed for his urban themes, which form the background to the vast majority of his most accomplished writings.<ref name=\"ibrextremacar\"/><ref>Ornea, p.64, 221\u2013223, 229; Vianu, Vol.I, p.312-313; Vol. II, p.198-200</ref>\n\nThe author depicted the city in all stages of its development and in all its atmospheres\u2014from nightlife to ''[[C\u0103ldur\u0103 mare]]'''s midday torpor, from noisy [[slum]]s and the ''T\u00e2rgul Mo\u015filor'' [[fair]] in [[Obor]] to the [[England|English]]-inspired [[tea party (social gathering)|tea parties]] of the urban elite.<ref name=\"ibrextremacar\"/><ref>Ornea, p.221-223; Vianu, Vol. II, p.199-200</ref> This large fresco drew comparisons with his generation colleague [[Ion Creang\u0103]], who was argued to have done the same for the countryside.<ref>Ornea, p.229</ref> Caragiale was especially proud of the opening paragraph in his ''Ultima emisiune...'' story, part of ''[[Momente \u015fi schi\u0163e]]'', which, he believed, the \"corner of a slum\" was suggested to perfection.<ref>Cioculescu, p.71</ref>\n\n[[Tudor Vianu]] also noted that, among cities and towns, Caragiale preferred Bucharest and those provincial centers most exposed to [[Central Europe]]an influences (specifically, the summer retreats in the [[Prahova Valley]] and other Wallachian stations on the way to Transylvania).<ref name=\"Vianu, Vol. II, p.199\">Vianu, Vol. II, p.199</ref> The enclosed world of the [[C\u0103ile Ferate Rom\u00e2ne|Romanian Railways]] also appealed to the writer, and an impressive number of his sketches relate to it in various ways.<ref name=\"zarifintrod\"/><ref name=\"Vianu, Vol. II, p.199\"/>\n\n==Collective characters==\n[[File:Sava Hentia - Targul Mosilor.jpg|thumb|''T\u00e2rgul Mo\u015filor'', the [[fair]] in [[Obor]] (late 19th-century painting by [[Sava Hen\u021bia]])]]\nConfessing at some point that \"the world was my school\", Caragiale dissimulated his background and critical eye as a means to blend into each environment he encountered, and even adopted the manners and speech patterns he later recorded in his literary work.<ref>Cioculescu, p.6-7; Vianu, Vol. II, p.195</ref> He thus encouraged familiarity, allowing people to reveal their histories, motivations, and culture.<ref name=\"Vianu, Vol. II, p.195\"/> Vianu recounted: \"The man was a consummate actor and a ''[[Deadpan|pince-sans-rire]]'', an ironist [...] to the point where his partners of dialog were never sure if they were spoken to \u00abseriously\u00bb [...].\"<ref name=\"Vianu, Vol. II, p.196\">Vianu, Vol. II, p.196</ref> In one of his pieces from 1899, he welcomed the famous actors [[Eleonora Duse]] and [[Jean Mounet-Sully]] to Bucharest, imitating the exaggerated style of other theater chroniclers\u2014the article ended with Caragiale confessing that he had not actually seen the two perform.<ref name=\"Vianu, Vol. II, p.196\"/> In one other instance, as a means to comment on [[plagiarism]], the author also parodied his own ''O f\u0103clie de Pa\u015fte''\u2014which he turned into the sketch, ''Noaptea \u00cenvierii''.<ref name=\"Vianu, Vol. II, p.205\"/>\n\nIn ''1907, din prim\u0103var\u0103 p\u00e2n\u0103 \u00een toamn\u0103'', his late and disillusioned work, Caragiale lashed out at the traditional class of political clients, with an indictment which, Tudor Vianu believed, also served to identify the main focus of his other writings:\n<blockquote>\"plebs incapable of work and lacking employment, impoverished suburban small traders and street vendors, petty dangerous agitators of the villages and of the areas adjacent to towns, bullying election agents; and then the hybrid product of all levels of schooling, semi-cultured intellectuals, lawyers and lawyerlings, professors, teachers and teacherlings, semi-illiterate and unfrocked priests, illiterate schoolteachers\u2014all of them beer garden theorists; next come the great functionaries and the little clerks, most of them removable from office.\"<ref>Vianu, Vol. II, p.190</ref></blockquote>\n\nDirect criticism was nonetheless rare in Caragiale's fiction: Vianu believed to have found traces of it in ''[[O scrisoare pierdut\u0103]]'' (\"the most cruel [of his satires]\") and in ''[[Grand Hotel \"Victoria rom\u00e2n\u0103\"]]'' (\"the most bitter\").<ref name=\"Vianu, Vol. II, p.201\">Vianu, Vol. II, p.201</ref> On several occasions, Caragiale showed or even defined himself as a sentimental, and his modesty was acknowledged by several of his friends.<ref>Vianu, Vol.I, p.314; Vol. II, p.197-198; Vol.III, p.74, 75\u201376</ref> Vianu noted that, alongside his Christian [[ethos]], this contributed to his distant, calm and often sympathetic overall take on society.<ref>Vianu, Vol.I, p.314; Vol. II, p.200-201</ref> In his words:\n<blockquote>\"A wave of charm, of reconciliation with life passes above all [his characters], one which, if it only assumes light and superficial shapes, experienced by naive people with harmless manias, is a sign that the collective existence is taking place in shelter from the great trials.\"<ref>Vianu, Vol. II, p.200</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn contrast with this, [[Poporanism|Poporanist]] critic [[Garabet Ibr\u0103ileanu]] argued that Caragiale actually hated the people who inspired his works, and claimed that the writer had made this clear during one of their conversations.<ref name=\"Cazimir 1967, p.44\">Cazimir (1967), p.44</ref> His account was considered doubtful by researcher [[\u015etefan Cazimir]], who believed that Ibr\u0103ileanu was using it to back a polemic and singular overview of Caragiale's work.<ref name=\"Cazimir 1967, p.44\"/>\n\nAccording to Vianu, there is a manifest difference between Ion Luca Caragiale's comedies and his ''[[Momente \u015fi schi\u0163e]]'': the former are, in his view, driven by situations and circumstances, whereas the latter sees Caragiale developing his original perspective to its fullest.<ref>Vianu, Vol.I, p.309-310; Vol. II, p.200-201</ref> This, he argues, was determined by important social changes\u2014a move from a traditional world\u2014awkwardly attempting to digest [[Westernization]], [[modernization]], and [[Francization|Francized]] culture\u2014, to a more stable and prosperous environment.<ref>Vianu, Vol.I, p.309-310; Vol. II, p.200</ref> A similar division was applied by Ibr\u0103ileanu.<ref name=\"ibrextremacar\"/><ref>Ornea, p.221</ref>\n\n==Types==\n\n===Theoretical aspects===\nThe form of [[Literary realism|Realism]] favored by Caragiale placed types of characters at the center of literary creativity, owing to the influence of [[Classicism]].<ref name=\"Vianu, Vol. II, p.201\"/> Several critics have credited ''Momente \u015fi schi\u0163e'', as well as all his dramas, with providing some of the first truly believable portrayals in local literature.<ref name=\"zarifintrod\"/><ref>M\u00eendra, p.269-270</ref> Vianu stressed that Classicist borrowings in Caragiale's writings were limited, indicating that Caragiale parted with the notion of \"generic types\" to look for the \"social\" ones.<ref name=\"Vianu, Vol. II, p.201\"/> In parallel, literary critic [[George C\u0103linescu]] argued that \"[t]he typological structure is present in Caragiale's work as a supporting structure, without being essential.\"<ref>C\u0103linescu, p.183</ref>\n\nIn Vianu's assessment, the universal human nature was important to Caragiale, but not made instantly obvious (as opposed to the immediate importance his characters were meant to have in the eyes of his public).<ref>Vianu, Vol. II, p.201-202</ref> Vianu illustrated this concept after investigating the manner in which Caragiale completed his ''O scrisoare pierdut\u0103'': the author was for long undecided about which character was to win the electoral battle on which the play centers, but opted for Agami\u0163\u0103 Dandanache, the senile [[Radicalism (historical)|radical]], because his victory was to give the play more depth.<ref name=\"Vianu, Vol. II, p.202\">Vianu, Vol. II, p.202</ref> Caragiale was thus quoted saying that Dandanache was \"more stupid\" than the clueless politician Tache Farfuridi, and \"more of a scoundrel\" than the unprincipled and cunning journalist Nae Ca\u0163avencu.<ref>Cazimir (1967), p.143; Ornea, p.221; Vianu, Vol. II, p.202</ref>\n\nIn Vianu's view, ''Momente \u015fi schi\u0163e'' was more vague in this respect, giving little insight into morals and states of mind, whereas the other, longer, novellas did depict feelings and occasionally provided additional details such as [[physiology]] or [[cenesthesia]].<ref name=\"Vianu, Vol. II, p.202\"/> Also according to Vianu, Ion Luca Caragiale, unlike the Naturalists, was generally not interested in offering the reader access to his characters' [[Psychology|psychological]] background\u2014aside from his ''[[N\u0103pasta]]'' and ''[[P\u0103cat]]'', and ''[[O f\u0103clie de Pa\u015fte]]'', he only adopted the psychological technique in satirical contexts, as a means to parody its use.<ref>Vianu, Vol. I, p.312</ref> A similar view was expressed by Vianu's predecessor, [[Silvian Iosifescu]], who also stressed that Caragiale always avoided applying the Naturalist technique to its fullest,<ref name=\"M\u00eendra, p.271\">M\u00eendra, p.271</ref> while George C\u0103linescu himself believed that the characters' motivations in ''O f\u0103clie de Pa\u015fte'' are actually physiological and [[Ethnology|ethnological]].<ref name=\"C\u0103linescu, p.179\">C\u0103linescu, p.179</ref>\n\nMaiorescu was especially fond of the way in which Caragiale balanced his personal perspective and the generic traits he emphasized: speaking of Leiba Zibal, the [[History of the Jews in Romania|Jewish]] character in ''O f\u0103clie de Pa\u015fte'' who defends himself out of fear, he drew a comparison with Shakespeare's [[Shylock]]. He thus noted that, for all the differences in style between the two authors, both their characters stood for the Jewish people as a whole.<ref name=\"zarifintrod\"/><ref>Ornea, p.50</ref> This assessment was backed by Maiorescu's adversary, [[Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea]].<ref name=\"dbrghestmet\"/> George C\u0103linescu also believed that, aside from his individual nature, Zibal provided readers with an accurate insight into Jewish reactions to systemic persecution and death threats.<ref name=\"C\u0103linescu, p.179\"/> Such assessments were rejected by [[Paul Zarifopol]], who opposed generalizations and commented that the work only referred to \"[t]he ingenious cruelty of a man maddened by fear\".<ref name=\"zarifintrod\"/>\n\n===Allegories===\nOne of Caragiale's main and earliest types is that of the young man gripped by love, expressing himself through emphatic and Romantic clich\u00e9s\u2014its main representative is ''[[O noapte furtunoas\u0103]]'''s Ric\u0103 Venturiano. As Vianu commented, Caragiale exploited the theme to so much success that it took another generation for youthful love to be presented in a non-comedic context (with the common signature writings of [[\u015etefan Octavian Iosif]] and [[Dimitrie Anghel]]).<ref>Vianu, Vol. II, p.454-455</ref> At the other end are [[Patriarchy|patriarchal]] figures, heads of families who seem unable or unwilling to investigate their wives' [[Adultery|adulterous]] relations with younger men.<ref name=\"danmanuca\"/><ref>Cazimir (1967), p.55-56; Cioculescu, p.56-59, 83\u201384, 85\u201388, 113</ref> This behavior is notably present in ''O noapte furtunoas\u0103'', where the aged Dumitrache fails to note even the most obvious signs that his wife Veta is in love with his good friend Chiriac.<ref>Cazimir (1967), p.55, 112\u2013119; Cioculescu, p.83-84</ref> A more complex situation is present in ''O scrisoare pierdut\u0103'', where political boss Trahanache cannot tell that his wife Joi\u0163ica is having an affair with Tip\u0103tescu, and, when confronted with the evidence, is more interested in proving that she is not.<ref>Cazimir (1967), p.55, 133\u2013134; Cioculescu, p.85-88</ref>\n\nWith Venturiano, Caragiale also introduces criticism of the liberal journalist and lawyers. A law school student, Venturiano contributes long and exaggerated articles to the republican press, which recall those authored by [[C. A. Rosetti]] and his collaborators.<ref name=\"ibrextremacar\"/><ref>Cioculescu, p.179-180, 183\u2013184; Ornea, p.210-211</ref> A more elaborate such character is Nae Ca\u0163avencu, who plays a major part in ''O scrisoare pierdut\u0103'', and who, using a \"Red\" discourse, attacks politicians on all sides with turbulent remarks and recourse to [[blackmail]].<ref name=\"ibrextremacar\"/><ref>Ornea, p.217-221</ref> He profits from the more moderate attitudes of his adversaries to proclaim himself a [[Progressivism|progressive]] politician, and he is successful in doing so\u2014Ca\u0163avencu rallies around him a group of teachers and other state employees.<ref>Ornea, p.217-219</ref> The only person who is able to stop his rise is Agami\u0163\u0103 Dandanache, an old [[Wallachian Revolution of 1848|1848 revolutionary]]. Danadanche, shown to have been sidelined from politics, makes a comeback at a time when the factions needs his inoffensive presence as a third-party, and, although senile, has a vast experience in blackmailing.<ref>Cazimir (1967), p.143-144; Ornea, p.220-221</ref> [[\u015etefan Cazimir]] linked Dandanache to a new [[aristocracy]], created around the first generation of Romanian liberals, and likened him to a [[Hidalgo (Spanish nobility)|hidalgo]].<ref>Cazimir (1967), p.144</ref> Tache Farfuridi, a competitor to both, has been described by Cazimir as a conformist self-seeker, in the manner of [[M. and Mme. Joseph Prudhomme|M. Joseph Prudhomme]], a character made famous by [[Henri Monnier]]'s prose.<ref>Cazimir (1967), p.136-137</ref>\n\nWritten between the two other comedies, ''[[Conu Leonida fa\u0163\u0103 cu reac\u0163iunea]]'' depicts the long-term effects of republican discourse on its fascinated audience, through the sayings and actions of Leonida. The latter, whose source of income is a state [[pension]], notably supports the notion that the \"Red\" republic will provide each clerk with a salary, a pension, as well as a [[debt moratorium]]<ref>Cioculescu, p.334; Ornea, p.215</ref>\u2014[[\u015eerban Cioculescu]] noted that this request had already been voiced in real life, and issued as a political program by an obscure [[Utopian socialism|Utopian socialist]] named Pi\u0163urc\u0103.<ref>Cioculescu, p.334</ref> Eventually, Leonida is convinced that revolution cannot be on the rise, since the authorities have banned the firing of weapons within city limits.<ref>Cazimir (1967), p.129; Cioculescu, p.337</ref> Similar fallacies are uttered by one of the secondary characters in ''[[D-ale carnavalului]]'', known to the other protagonists as ''Catindatul'', who has a vague familiarity with both [[Subjective idealism|subjective idealist]] and [[Materialism|materialist]] tenets, the sources for his absurd theories about [[suggestibility]] and \"magnetism\"\u2014two processes in which he sees the universal source for all discomfort or disease.<ref>Cazimir (1967), p.155-157</ref> In parallel, Zarifopol argued, the writer had even allowed ironic reflections on the impact of various theories to seep into a more serious work, ''O f\u0103clie de Pa\u015fte'', where two students terrify the innkeeper Zibal by casually discussing [[anthropological criminology]].<ref name=\"zarifintrod\"/>\n\nSeveral other of Caragiale's characters have traditionally been considered [[Allegory|allegories]] of [[social class]]es and even regional identities. One of the most famous ones is [[Mitic\u0103]], a recurring character who stands for ordinary [[Bucharest]]ers, [[Wallachia]]ns or [[Muntenia]]ns in general.<ref name=\"danmanuca\"/><ref name=\"C\u0103linescu, p.181\"/> A [[Hypocrisy|hypocritical]] and seemingly superficial man, Mitic\u0103 expresses himself through either platitudes or clich\u00e9s he believes are clever,<ref name=\"danmanuca\"/> and, illustrating a tendency Caragiale first recorded in his ''[[Moftul Rom\u00e2n]]'', quickly dismisses all important things he is confronted with.<ref name=\"C\u0103linescu, p.181\"/> Similarly, the teacher [[Marius Chico\u015f Rostogan]], who is present or named in several sketches, stands for those [[Transylvania]]n expatriates in Romania whose sympathies went to the liberal current.<ref name=\"Ornea, p.226\"/> His discourse, through which Caragiale sarcastically illustrates liberal tenets in respect to [[Education in Romania|Romanian education]], is centered on a disregard for content and a rigor for memorizing irrelevant details.<ref name=\"zarifintrod\"/><ref name=\"Ornea, p.226\"/> It has been proposed that Rostogan is at least partly based on Vasile Grigore Borgovan, a Transylvanian-born educator and resident of [[Drobeta-Turnu Severin|Turnu Severin]].<ref>Cioculescu, p.254</ref>\n\n''Cet\u0103\u0163eanul turmentat'', an unnamed inebriated man who makes brief but relevant appearances in ''O scrisoare pierdut\u0103'', is thought to symbolize simple townsfolk, utterly confused by the political battle going on around them, and ignored by all the notabilities.<ref>Cioculescu, p.80; Vianu, Vol.I, p.309; Vol. II, p.201</ref> Like his counterpart, the police agent Ghi\u0163\u0103 Pristanda, the inebriated elector has no relevant personal ambition,<ref>Cazimir (1967), p.143-149</ref> and stands for the so-called \"government dowry\"\u2014people afraid of losing their offices, and ready to back whoever is in power.<ref>Cioculescu, p.80-81</ref> According to C\u0103linescu, the inebriated citizen worships authority as a \"supreme god\", despite all its absurdities.<ref>Cazimir (1967), p.55</ref> He repeatedly claims to have served Trahanache during [[Alexander John Cuza]]'s ousting, but his supposed patron only acknowledges him once, when asking party members to \"escort this honorable person outside\".<ref>Cazimir (1967), p.146</ref>\n\nIn a number of his short stories and sketches, Caragiale makes use of another particularly ''Junimist'' theme, and investigates the glamorous but superficial impact of [[modernization]] on [[upper class|high society]].<ref name=\"ibrextremacar\"/><ref>Ornea, p.222-224</ref> In one sketch, a couple of ladies dine in an opulent salon, while cursing their maid, gossiping, and showing interest in vulgar subjects.<ref name=\"ibrextremacar\"/><ref>Ornea, p.222-223</ref> The characters in these writings tend to resemble each other, evidencing the generic traits of the well-to-do.<ref>Ornea, p.223</ref>\n\n===Other traits and characters===\n[[Anxiety|Anxieties]] take the central stage in several of Caragiale's writings. From early on, Caragiale's minute analysis of mounting terror in ''O f\u0103clie de Pa\u015fte'' won the praise of [[Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea]].<ref>M\u00eendra, p.267</ref> In several of his sketches and stories, characters are driven to despair by their inability to cope with real or presumed changes in their environment.<ref name=\"holbanemigr\"/><ref name=\"Cioculescu, p.89\">Cioculescu, p.89</ref> This is shown to have happened to characters such as Leiba Zibal, Stavrache\u2014the pub owner in ''[[\u00cen vreme de r\u0103zboi]]''\u2014, as well as Anghelache (the suicide victim in ''Inspec\u0163iune...'', part of ''[[Momente \u015fi schi\u0163e]]'').<ref>C\u0103linescu, p.180; Cioculescu, p.89</ref> \u015eerban Cioculescu referred to the latter three as \"great [[Neurosis|neurotics]]\",<ref name=\"Cioculescu, p.89\"/> while Iosifescu defined Zibal and Stavrache as \"[[Dementia|demented]]\".<ref name=\"M\u00eendra, p.271\"/> Among the group of insane characters in Caragiale's work, C\u0103linescu counted those of sketches and stories like ''1 Aprilie'' (\"1st of April\"), where an [[April Fools' Day|April Fool]] ends with a murder, and ''[[Dou\u0103 loturi]]'', where the clerk Lefter Popescu goes through the tribulations of having lost his winning ticket.<ref>Cazimir (1967), p.56; C\u0103linescu, p.179-180</ref>\n\nAnxiety over imminent events grips the main characters in ''Conu Leonida fa\u0163\u0103 cu reac\u0163iunea'', and plays a part in female behavior as depicted in all his other comedies.<ref>Cioculescu, p.83-88, 89\u201392</ref> A special kind of fear animates the main protagonists of ''D-ale carnavalului'', whose jealousy leads them to act irrationally.<ref>Cazimir (1967), p.149-157; Cioculescu, p.89-92</ref> Thus, Iancu Pampon, an assistant-barber and former police officer, and his female counterpart, the republican suburbanite Mi\u0163a Baston, are determined to uncover their partners' amorous escapades, and their hectic inquiry combines real clues with figments of imagination, fits of passionate rage with moments of sad meditation, and violent threats with periods of resignation.<ref>Cazimir (1967), p.149-155</ref> Glimpses into this type of behavior have been noted in other plays by Caragiale: Cazimir placed emphasis on the fact that Farfuridi is shown to be extremely cautious towards all unplanned changes, and consumes much of his energy in preserving a largely pointless daily routine.<ref>Cazimir (1967), p.137-138</ref>\n\nMany of Caragiale's writings reproduce discussions between clerks on their time off, which usually take the shape of generic and awkward forays into culture or politics. Several of the characters in his sketches spuriously claim to be personal friends of major political figures of the day, or to have access to the back-rooms of politics and journalism.<ref>Cioculescu, p.113, 114</ref> Although often alarmed by political or social developments, they tend to accommodate them quickly, and often encourage each other during very long stays at the [[beer garden]].<ref>Ornea, p.223-224</ref> Gravitating in this environment are the petty journalists, who boast access to unlikely [[Scoop (term)|scoops]], such as [[Bulgaria]] having decided to invade Romania.<ref name=\"ibrextremacar\"/><ref name=\"Cioculescu, p.114\">Cioculescu, p.114</ref> In one instance, Caragiale invents Caracudi, a newspaperman who writes his [[Sensationalism|sensationalist]] articles while relaxing in the park.<ref name=\"Cioculescu, p.114\"/>\n\nCaragiale's [[persona]] is placed in numerous of his works. Aside from deduced self-portraits in ''[[C\u0103nu\u0163\u0103 om sucit]]'' and elsewhere, he created the famous background character Nenea Iancu (\"Uncle Iancu\"), building on his colloquial name and his status as a regular client of the beer gardens.<ref>Vianu, Vol. II, p.204</ref> He introduces several of his ''Momente \u015fi schi\u0163e'' characters as personal friends, and garnishes the stories with intimate details.<ref>Cioculescu, p.56-57</ref> Late in his life, he even confessed that the affair involving Venturiano, Dumitrache, and Dumitrache's wife Veta was partly based on an amorous misadventure he experienced as a young man.<ref>Cioculescu, p.279</ref>\n\n==Literary influences==\n[[File:Daumier - Honest people.jpg|thumb|''We are all honest people, let's embrace one another, and let this be over with'', 1834 print by [[Honor\u00e9 Daumier]]]]\nAside from the many authors whose works he quoted, translated or [[Parody|parodied]], Ion Luca Caragiale built on a vast literary legacy. According to literary historian [[\u015etefan Cazimir]]: \"No writer ever had as large a number of precursors [as Caragiale], just as no other artistic synthesis was ever more organic and more spontaneous.\"<ref>Cazimir (1967), p.63-64</ref>\n\nA man of the theater first and foremost, Caragiale was well-acquainted with the work of his predecessors, from [[William Shakespeare]] to the [[Romanticism|Romantics]], and heavily impressed by the French ''[[com\u00e9die en vaudeville]]''.<ref name=\"Vianu, Vol. I, p.310\"/> He applied the notion of [[well-made play]]s, as theorized by [[Eug\u00e8ne Scribe]], and was also influenced by the [[dramaturgy]] of [[Eug\u00e8ne Marin Labiche]] and [[Victorien Sardou]].<ref name=\"danmanuca\"/><ref>Cazimir (1967), p.96-101; Vianu, Vol. I, p.310-311, 314</ref> Reportedly, Labiche was his favorite author.<ref>Cazimir (1967), p.98</ref>\n\nThe writer himself cited [[Cilibi Moise]], a [[History of the Jews in Romania|Wallachian Jewish]] [[peddler]] and [[Aphorism|aphorist]], as an early influence, recalling how, as a child, he used to read his [[one-liner joke]]s, and treasured them as exceptional samples of concise humor.<ref name=\"Cazimir 1967, p.62\">Cazimir (1967), p.62</ref> He was similarly impressed by the works of Moise's contemporary, the prolific author [[Anton Pann]], whose accomplishments he praised during talks with his fellow ''[[Convorbiri Critice]]'' contributors,<ref name=\"Cazimir 1967, p.62\"/> and whose work served as a source for at least one of his own stories.<ref name=\"zarifintrod\"/> [[Nicolae Filimon]], whom Caragiale praised on several occasions, was the author of short stories which several authors have identified as less accomplished versions of Ric\u0103 Venturiano.<ref>Cazimir (1967), p.82-84</ref> A similar connection has been traced between the various sketches authored by [[Ion Heliade R\u0103dulescu]], in which Transylvanian writers are the object of ridicule, and Caragiale's character [[Marius Chico\u015f Rostogan]].<ref>Cazimir (1967), p.84-86</ref> Caragiale's late admiration for [[Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu]] was also linked to affinities in comedic styles,<ref>Cazimir (1967), p.86-89</ref> as was his companionship with [[Iacob Negruzzi]] (himself the author of sarcastic pieces ridiculing the liberal politicians and lawyers).<ref name=\"zarifintrod\"/><ref>Cazimir (1967), p.89-93; Vianu, Vol.II, p.88</ref>\n\nCaragiale is also believed to have used and developed several themes already present in [[Theatre of Romania|Romanian theater]]. One such precursor is the author of comedies [[Teodor Myller]], especially through his play ''Fata lui Chir Troanc\u0103'' (\"Kir Troanc\u0103's Daughter\").<ref>Cioculescu, p.181-182</ref> The writer was most likely very familiar with the comedies authored by his two uncles, [[Costache Caragiale|Costache]] and [[Iorgu Caragiale|Iorgu]], which have been shown to develop themes he later explored in depth.<ref>Cazimir (1967), p.73-76</ref> Among the minor 19th century dramatists whose comedic works were familiar to Caragiale, and in many ways similar to his, own was [[Costache Halepliu]].<ref>Cazimir (1967), p.76-79</ref> Another often-cited influence is his predecessor and adversary [[Vasile Alecsandri]], whose ''[[Coana Chiri\u0163a]]'' plays are an early critique of [[Westernization]].<ref name=\"ibrextremacar\"/><ref>Cazimir (1967), p.70-72</ref> The two authors nonetheless differ in many ways, with Caragiale assuming a more complex role, and observing a more complex society.<ref name=\"antohi\"/><ref name=\"zarifintrod\"/><ref name=\"ibrextremacar\"/><ref>Cazimir (1967), p.72; M\u00eendra, p.32</ref>\n\nIon Luca Caragiale is known to have been amused by the [[stock character]] [[Robert Macaire]], at a time when the latter had been turned into a comedic character by [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rick Lema\u00eetre]].<ref>Cazimir (1967), p.102-103</ref> While in [[Berlin]], he purchased the cartoons of French artists [[Honor\u00e9 Daumier]] and [[Paul Gavarni]] (although it is not known if their separate portrayals of Macaire were familiar to him)<ref name=\"Cazimir 1967, p.103-105\">Cazimir (1967), p.103-105</ref>\u2014among these drawings was one showing notabilities embracing one another while picking each other's pockets, which shows similarities with Caragiale's own take on society.<ref>Cazimir (1967), p.104</ref> According to Cazimir, it is possible that he knew Daumier's work from early on, as several other subjects caricatured by the French artist bear a remarkable resemblance to his texts.<ref name=\"Cazimir 1967, p.103-105\"/>\n\nIon Luca Caragiale was also keenly aware and receptive of his contemporaries' works and of ''[[fin de si\u00e8cle]]'' innovations. The literary creations of [[\u00c9mile Zola]] were a noted source of inspiration, and the parallel led [[George C\u0103linescu]] to propose him and [[Barbu \u015etef\u0103nescu Delavrancea]] as the main representatives of Zola's style in local literature.<ref name=\"C\u0103linescu, p.179\"/> At the same time, [[Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea]] believed that both ''[[N\u0103pasta]]'' and ''[[O f\u0103clie de Pa\u015fte]]'' showed the \"obvious enough influence\" of [[Fyodor Dostoevsky]].<ref>{{in lang|ro}} [[Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea]], [http://ro.wikisource.org/wiki/Dl_Panu_asupra_criticii_%C5%9Fi_literaturii ''Dl Panu asupra criticii \u015fi literaturii''] (wikisource)</ref> Late in his life, Caragiale discovered the literature of [[Anatole France]]\u2014according to [[Paul Zarifopol]], France's [[Humanism|Humanist]] themes served as a model for some of Caragiale's [[Fantasy literature|fantasy]] writings.<ref name=\"Vianu, Vol. II, p.195\"/><ref name=\"zarifintrod\"/>\n\nDiscussing the latter works, Vianu noted that they reminded one of [[Shakespeare's late romances]],<ref name=\"Vianu, Vol. II, p.205\"/> while [[\u015eerban Cioculescu]] believed them to have been indirectly inspired by the works of [[Edgar Allan Poe]].<ref name=\"Cioculescu, p.38\"/> In his report for the Academy, [[Dimitrie C. Oll\u0103nescu-Ascanio]] also drew a parallel between Poe's works and ''[[La hanul lui M\u00e2njoal\u0103]]'', but this hypothesis was rejected by Zarifopol.<ref name=\"zarifintrod\"/> In addition, ''[[Kir Ianulea]]'', partly using [[Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli]]'s novel as a source, was held as evidence of Caragiale's interest in [[Renaissance literature]].<ref>Vianu, Vol. I, p.313, 314</ref>\n\n==Cultural legacy==\n\nThe writer's investigations into [[Culture of Romania|Romanian culture]] also resulted in an accurate record of the [[Romanian language]] as it was spoken during his day, sampling [[Romanian dialects|dialects]], [[jargon]], [[slang]], verbal [[tic]]s, as well as illustrating the experiments undertaken by conflicting schools of [[linguistics]] during the 19th and early 20th century, as well as the traces they left on the [[Romanian lexis]].<ref>Vianu, Vol. II, p.203-204, 240\u2013241; Vol.III, p.246</ref> In [[Tudor Vianu]]'s opinion, this was partly owed to his keen musical ear.<ref>Vianu, Vol. II, p.203</ref>\n\nCaragiale was an enduring influence on both [[Romanian humor]] and the views Romanians take of themselves.<ref name=\"boiaborderland\">[[Lucian Boia]], ''Romania: Borderland of Europe'', Reaktion Books, London, 2001, p.247. {{ISBN|1-86189-103-2}}</ref> His comedies and various stories have produced a series of [[catchphrase]]s, many of which are still present in both cultural reference. Nevertheless, his uncomfortable criticism has occasionally seen him assigned a secondary place in the [[Education in Romania|Romanian curriculum]] and the academic discourse, a tendency notably endorsed by the [[Iron Guard]] (Romania's main [[Fascism|fascist]] movement) and the [[Communist Romania|Communist regime]].<ref name=\"antohi\"/>\n\nIn parallel, Caragiale's techniques have influenced 20th century dramatists such as [[Mihail Sorbul]], [[Victor Ion Popa]], [[Mihail Sebastian]], and [[George Mihail Zamfirescu]],<ref>M\u00eendra, p.33</ref> and various directors, beginning with [[Constantin I. Nottara]] and [[Paul Gusti]].<ref name=\"Cioculescu, p.323\"/> Several of his theatrical writings have been the subject of essays authored by director [[Sic\u0103 Alexandrescu]], whose interpretation of the texts made use of the [[Stanislavsky System]].<ref>Cioculescu, p.325-342</ref> Caragiale's short stories and novellas have inspired authors such as [[Ioan A. Bassarabescu]], [[Gheorghe Br\u0103escu]], [[Ioan Alexandru Br\u0103tescu-Voine\u015fti]], [[Dumitru D. P\u0103tr\u0103\u015fcanu]], [[I.
