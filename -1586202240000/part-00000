In 1912, American promoter [[Guy Weadick]] organized his first rodeo and festival, known as the Stampede. He returned to Calgary in 1919 to organize the Victory Stampede in honour of soldiers returning from World War I. Weadick's festival became an annual event in 1923 when it merged with the Calgary Industrial Exhibition to create the '''Calgary Exhibition and Stampede'''.\n\nOrganized by thousands of volunteers and supported by civic leaders, the Calgary Stampede has grown into one of the world's richest rodeos, one of Canada's largest festivals, and a significant tourist attraction for the city.  Rodeo and chuckwagon racing events are televised across Canada.  However, both have been the target of increasing international criticism by [[animal welfare]] groups and politicians concerned about particular events as well as [[animal rights]] organizations seeking to ban rodeo in general.\n\nCalgary's national and international identity is tied to the event. It is known as the \"Stampede City\", carries the informal nickname of \"Cowtown\", and the local [[Canadian Football League]] team is called the [[Calgary Stampeders|Stampeders]].  The city takes on a party atmosphere during Stampede: office buildings and storefronts are painted in cowboy themes, residents don [[western wear]], and events held across the city include hundreds of pancake breakfasts and [[barbecue]]s.\n\n==History==\n[[File: Program for 1912 Calgary Stampede.jpg|thumb|right|The Program for the 1912 Calgary Stampede featuring the [[The Big Four (Calgary)|Big Four]]: Burns, Lane, Cross, and McLean.

The society held its first [[fair]] two years later, attracting a quarter of the town's 2,000 residents.<ref name=\"GuysDream\">{{citation |last=Dudley |first=Wendy |title=Guy's Stampede dream |work=Calgary Herald |date=1997-07-03 |page=SS2}}</ref> By 1889, it had acquired land on the banks of the [[Elbow River]] to host the exhibitions, but crop failures, poor weather, and a declining economy resulted in the society ceasing operations in 1895.<ref>{{harvnb|Dixon|Read|2005|p=26}}</ref> The land passed briefly to the future [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[R.

The area was called [[Beltline, Calgary|Victoria Park]], after [[Queen Victoria]], and the newly formed Western Pacific Exhibition Company hosted its first agricultural and industrial fair in 1899.<ref>{{harvnb|Dixon|Read|2005|p=27}}</ref>\n\nThe exhibition grew annually, and in 1908 the Government of Canada announced that Calgary would host the federally funded [[Dominion Exhibition]] that year.  Seeking to take advantage of the opportunity to promote itself, the city spent [[Canadian dollar|C$]]145,000 to build six new pavilions and a racetrack.<ref name=\"Dixon29\">{{harvnb|Dixon|Read|2005|p=29}}</ref> It held a lavish parade as well as [[rodeo]], horse racing, and [[trick roping]] competitions as part of the event.<ref name=\"GuysDream\" />  The exhibition was a success, drawing 100,000 people to the fairgrounds over seven days despite an economic recession that afflicted the city of 25,000.<ref name=\"Dixon29\" />\n\n[[Guy Weadick]], an American trick roper who participated in the Dominion Exhibition as part of the [[Miller Brothers 101 Ranch]] Real Wild West Show, returned to Calgary in 1912 in the hopes of establishing an event that more accurately represented the \"wild west\" than the shows he was a part of.<ref>{{harvnb|Dixon|Read|2005|p=30}}</ref> He initially failed to sell civic leaders and the Calgary Industrial Exhibition on his plans,<ref name=\"CHWeadickVision\">{{citation |last=Seskus |first=Tony |url=https://calgaryherald.com/homes/stampede/6479984/story.html |title=Guy Weadick's grand vision |work=Calgary Herald |date=2012-04-30 |accessdate=2012-06-09}}</ref> but with the assistance of local livestock agent H.

However, the Big Four were not interested in hosting another such event.<ref>{{harvnb|Kennedy|1965|p=22}}</ref> Businessmen in [[Winnipeg]] convinced Weadick to host his second Stampede in their city, but the show failed financially.

In 2008, the Calgary Stampede was inducted into the [[ProRodeo Hall of Fame]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.prorodeohalloffame.com/inductees/by-category/rodeo-committees/calgary-stampede/|title=Calgary Stampede - Pro Rodeo Hall of Fame|work=Pro Rodeo Hall of Fame|access-date=2017-04-12|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nThe event's roots are traced to 1886 when the Calgary and District Agricultural Society held its first fair. In 1912, American promoter [[Guy Weadick]] organized his first rodeo and festival, known as the Stampede. He returned to Calgary in 1919 to organize the Victory Stampede in honour of soldiers returning from World War I. Weadick's festival became an annual event in 1923 when it merged with the Calgary Industrial Exhibition to create the '''Calgary Exhibition and Stampede'''.\n\nOrganized by thousands of volunteers and supported by civic leaders, the Calgary Stampede has grown into one of the world's richest rodeos, one of Canada's largest festivals, and a significant tourist attraction for the city.  Rodeo and chuckwagon racing events are televised across Canada.  However, both have been the target of increasing international criticism by [[animal welfare]] groups and politicians concerned about particular events as well as [[animal rights]] organizations seeking to ban rodeo in general.\n\nCalgary's national and international identity is tied to the event. It is known as the \"Stampede City\", carries the informal nickname of \"Cowtown\", and the local [[Canadian Football League]] team is called the [[Calgary Stampeders|Stampeders]].  The city takes on a party atmosphere during Stampede: office buildings and storefronts are painted in cowboy themes, residents don [[western wear]], and events held across the city include hundreds of pancake breakfasts and [[barbecue]]s.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Program for 1912 Calgary Stampede.jpg|thumb|right|The Program for the 1912 Calgary Stampede featuring the [[The Big Four (Calgary)|Big Four]]: Burns, Lane, Cross, and McLean. This poster is part of the [[Glenbow Museum|Glenbow Archives]].|alt=A poster featuring a man riding a bucking horse on an open prairie field.  In each corner is a photograph of four different middle-aged well-dressed gentlemen.]]\nThe Calgary and District Agricultural Society was formed in 1884 to promote the town and encourage farmers and ranchers from eastern Canada to move west. The society held its first [[fair]] two years later, attracting a quarter of the town's 2,000 residents.<ref name=\"GuysDream\">{{citation |last=Dudley |first=Wendy |title=Guy's Stampede dream |work=Calgary Herald |date=1997-07-03 |page=SS2}}</ref> By 1889, it had acquired land on the banks of the [[Elbow River]] to host the exhibitions, but crop failures, poor weather, and a declining economy resulted in the society ceasing operations in 1895.<ref>{{harvnb|Dixon|Read|2005|p=26}}</ref> The land passed briefly to future [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[R. B. Bennett]] who sold it to the city.  The area was called [[Beltline, Calgary|Victoria Park]], after [[Queen Victoria]], and the newly formed Western Pacific Exhibition Company hosted its first agricultural and industrial fair in 1899.<ref>{{harvnb|Dixon|Read|2005|p=27}}</ref>\n\nThe exhibition grew annually, and in 1908 the Government of Canada announced that Calgary would host the federally funded [[Dominion Exhibition]] that year.  Seeking to take advantage of the opportunity to promote itself, the city spent [[Canadian dollar|C$]]145,000 to build six new pavilions and a racetrack.<ref name=\"Dixon29\">{{harvnb|Dixon|Read|2005|p=29}}</ref> It held a lavish parade as well as [[rodeo]], horse racing, and [[trick roping]] competitions as part of the event.<ref name=\"GuysDream\" />  The exhibition was a success, drawing 100,000 people to the fairgrounds over seven days despite an economic recession that afflicted the city of 25,000.<ref name=\"Dixon29\" />\n\n[[Guy Weadick]], an American trick roper who participated in the Dominion Exhibition as part of the [[Miller Brothers 101 Ranch]] Real Wild West Show, returned to Calgary in 1912 in the hopes of establishing an event that more accurately represented the \"wild west\" than the shows he was a part of.<ref>{{harvnb|Dixon|Read|2005|p=30}}</ref> He initially failed to sell civic leaders and the Calgary Industrial Exhibition on his plans,<ref name=\"CHWeadickVision\">{{citation |last=Seskus |first=Tony |url=https://calgaryherald.com/homes/stampede/6479984/story.html |title=Guy Weadick's grand vision |work=Calgary Herald |date=2012-04-30 |accessdate=2012-06-09}}</ref> but with the assistance of local livestock agent H. C. McMullen, Weadick convinced businessmen [[Patrick Burns (politician)|Pat Burns]], [[George Lane (politician)|George Lane]], [[Archie McLean (politician)|A. J. McLean]], and [[A. E. Cross]] to put up $100,000 to guarantee funding for the event.<ref name=\"GuysDream\" /> The [[Big Four (Calgary)|Big Four]], as they came to be known, viewed the project as a final celebration of their life as cattlemen.<ref>{{harvnb|Foran|2008|p=5}}</ref> The city built a rodeo arena on the fairgrounds and over 100,000 people attended the six-day event in September 1912 to watch hundreds of cowboys from Western Canada, the United States, and Mexico compete for $20,000 in prizes.<ref>{{harvnb|Dixon|Read|2005|p=32}}</ref> The event generated $120,000 in revenue and was hailed as a success.<ref name=\"GuysDream\" />\n\nWeadick set about planning the 1913 Stampede, promoting the event across North America.  However, the Big Four were not interested in hosting another such event.<ref>{{harvnb|Kennedy|1965|p=22}}</ref> Businessmen in [[Winnipeg]] convinced Weadick to host his second Stampede in their city, but the show failed financially.  A third attempt held in [[New York (state)|New York]] State in 1916 suffered the same fate.<ref name=\"Kennedy23\">{{harvnb|Kennedy|1965|p=23}}</ref> Weadick returned to Calgary in 1919 where he gained the support of [[E. L. Richardson]], the general manager of the Calgary Industrial Exhibition.  The two convinced numerous Calgarians, including the Big Four, to back the \"Great Victory Stampede\" in celebration of Canada's soldiers returning from World War I.<ref name=\"Kennedy23\" />\n\n===Calgary Exhibition and Stampede===\nWhile the 1919 Stampede was successful, it was again held as a one-time event.  Richardson was convinced that it could be a profitable annual event but found little support for the concept within the board of directors of the Calgary Industrial Exhibition. However, declining attendance and mounting financial losses forced the exhibition board to reconsider Richardson's proposals at their 1922 annual meeting.<ref name=\"Kennedy28\">{{harvnb|Kennedy|1965|p=28}}</ref>  Richardson proposed merging the two events on a trial basis. Weadick agreed, and the union created the Calgary Exhibition and Stampede.<ref name=\"Dixon36\">{{harvnb|Dixon|Read|2005|p=36}}</ref>\n\n[[File:1923 Calgary Stampede parade.jpg|thumb|left|1923 Stampede parade|alt=Hundreds of men on horseback march down a city street as people observe from the sidewalks and rooftops.]]\nThe combined event was first held in 1923. Weadick encouraged the city's residents to dress in western clothes and decorate their businesses in the spirit of the \"wild west\".<ref name=\"GuysDream\" />  Civic leaders truly supported the event for the first time: Mayor [[George Harry Webster|George Webster]] followed the costume suggestion and allowed downtown roads to be closed for two hours each morning of the six-day event to accommodate street parties.<ref name=\"Dixon36\" /> The new sport of [[chuckwagon racing]] was introduced and proved immediately popular.<ref>{{citation |title=2009 Calgary Stampede Evening Show Program |publisher=Calgary Stampede |page=8}}</ref> 138,950 people attended and the event earned a profit.<ref name=\"Dixon36\" />  Over 167,000 people attended in 1924 and the success guaranteed that the Stampede and Exhibition would be held together permanently.<ref name=\"Dixon38\">{{harvnb|Dixon|Read|2005|p=38}}</ref>\n\nAttendance grew annually throughout the 1920s, peaking at 258,496 in 1928, but the onset of the [[Great Depression]] resulted in attendance declines and financial losses. After consecutive years of losses in 1930 and 1931, the exhibition board was forced to make cutbacks, a decision that strained the relationship between the board and Weadick.<ref name=\"Kennedy41\">{{harvnb|Kennedy|1965|p=41}}</ref>  Furthering the divide was Weadick's growing resentment of the board's control of what he considered his event.  The issue came to a head in 1932 when Weadick and Richardson engaged in a loud argument over the situation, ending with Weadick's threat to quit entirely.<ref>{{harvnb|Livingstone|1996|p=110}}</ref> One month later, the exhibition board announced that it had relieved him of his duties.<ref name=\"Kennedy41\" /> Angered by the decision, Weadick sued the exhibition board for $100,000, citing breach of contract and unfair dismissal.<ref>{{harvnb|Livingstone|1996|p=111}}</ref>  His claim was upheld in courts, but he was awarded only $2,750 plus legal fees.<ref>{{harvnb|Kennedy|1965|p=42}}</ref>  Embittered by the events, Weadick remained at odds with the board for 20 years until he was invited to the 1952 Stampede as an honoured guest and parade marshal.<ref>{{harvnb|Livingstone|1996|p=120}}</ref>\n\nAt least seven movies were filmed at the Stampede by 1950.

Production of the Prelude concluded in 2001 upon the introduction of the [[Honda Integra DC5]].\n\nThe Prelude name was originally trademarked by [[Toyota]], but was amicably given to Honda for use.

The machine, like all Hondas, embodies fabrication that is, in my opinion, surpassed only by the narrowest of margins by Mercedes-Benz.

Honda used a single central gauge cluster design in this car which housed the speedometer and tachometer in one combined unit where both instrument's needles swept along the same arc. They also placed the compact AM/FM radio unit up high next to the gauge cluster. The Prelude featured intermittent wipers, tinted glass, and a remote trunk release. 1980 saw the introduction of the CVCC-II engine which employed the use of a catalytic converter and several other refinements that improved driveability, the Prelude also received a mild facelift in 1981.

Riding on an all-new platform, the Prelude was initially available with an [[Honda A engine|A18A]] or ET-2, 1.8&nbsp;L 12-valve twin carburetor engine, producing 105&nbsp;PS (77&nbsp;kW).<ref name=Moniteur>{{cite journal | ref = PdL | journal = Le Moniteur de l'Automobile | pages = 16\u201317 | title = Essai D\u00e9taille: Honda Prelude EX | last = De Leener | first = Philippe | location = Brussels, Belgium | language = French | volume = 33 | number = 770 | date = 2 June 1983 | publisher = Editions Auto-Magazine }}</ref> In Japan, Asia and Europe, it later became available with a 2-liter DOHC 16-valve PGM-FI engine (JDM = BA1, EU = BA2) although this engine was not released in Europe until 1986. The JDM [[Honda B20A engine|B20A]] produced {{convert|160|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} at 6300&nbsp;rpm, while the European B20A1 produced only {{convert|137|hp|abbr=on}}. This was the first generation of Prelude to have pop-up headlights, which allowed for a more aerodynamic front clip, reducing drag. Opening the headlights, however, especially at higher speeds, produced significantly more drag. The design retained nothing of the first generation, being considerably more aerodynamic and with large glass surfaces. As with the predecessor, it was amply equipped, with an air of \"[[Grand tourer|mini-gran turismo]]\" rather than that of a sports car.<ref name=Mon15>[[#PdL|De Leener]], p. 15</ref> It also offered, as an option, Honda's new [[Anti-lock braking system|\"A.L.B.\" anti-lock brakes]].<ref name=Moniteur/>\n\nIn Japan, the Prelude was one of the key models sold at Japanese Honda dealership sales channels, called ''[[Honda#Japan|Honda Verno]]'', which offered performance-oriented products. All ''Honda Verno'' products, like the [[Honda Vigor#Second generation (CA1-CA2-CA3)|Vigor]], initially shared the concealed headlights introduced with this generation Prelude that would help identify \"sports\" products from Honda in Japan however, the approach was short-lived. The model with the 2.0 liter engine was regarded as the top level car in Japan because Japanese buyers were liable for a higher annual [[Road tax#Japan|road tax]] over the car with the 1.8 liter engine. The Japanese 1.8 had CVCC and claimed {{convert|125|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}}, considerably more than export models.\n\nWhen the 2-liter 16-valve DOHC engine came out the hood had to be slightly modified since the larger engine could not fit under the original hood. The original 1.8-liter engine was developed specifically for the Prelude to allow a low hoodline, even tilting the engine backward to make it lower yet.<ref name=Moniteur/> The European version also saw slight modifications to the rear lights and revised front and rear bumpers which were now color-matched. Due to the fairly low weight of the car ({{convert|1025|kg|lb|abbr=on|disp=or}}) and high power (the 16-valve engine produced {{convert|160|PS|kW|0|abbr=on|disp=or}} in Japanese trim), the car was relatively nimble in comparison to its competitors, which most Preludes had not been up to that time.\n\nThe North American 1983 model is identifiable by its standard painted steel wheels with bright trim rings (although alloy rims were optional). The 1984-87 base models had Civic-style full wheel covers. In Canada, a \"Special Edition\" trim was created, which is essentially the same as the USA 2.0Si \"sport injected\" model. Fuel injection was introduced in the \"Si\" models in 1985. North American 1.8's offered {{Convert|100|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, while the later 2.0 has {{Convert|110|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nThis version of the Prelude was far more popular in Britain than its predecessor, and sold well at a time when sports cars were declining in popularity and many manufacturers were withdrawing from this market sector; including [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]], who did not replace the [[Ford Capri|Capri]] after its 1986 demise, even though it had been one of Britain's 10 most popular new cars as recently as 1980. The European lineup originally consisted of the base Prelude, without power steering, and the well-equipped EX which was also available with an automatic transmission and the A.L.B. brakes.<ref name=Moniteur/>\n\n{{gallery | width = 191 | height = 107\n|File:Prelude 2nd gen rear.jpg|1986 Honda Prelude SE Rear\n|File:1986-1987 Honda Prelude Si coupe 01.jpg|1986\u20131987 Honda Prelude Si coupe (Australia)\n|File:1986-1987 Honda Prelude Si coupe 02.jpg|1986\u20131987 Honda Prelude Si coupe (Australia)\n|File:1987 Honda Prelude side.JPG|Honda Prelude. 1987, Base 1.8L DOHC, twin carb.

Featuring evolutionary styling from its predecessor, it shared design cues from the [[Honda NSX]] that would be introduced later in 1989. The Prelude featured innovative features for its time such as a 0.34 drag coefficient, roof pillars made of high-strength metal and its signature feature, the available option of the world's first mechanical [[four wheel steering]] system available in a mass-production passenger car. Honda had expected 30% of buyers to plump for four-wheel-steering, but the car was a runaway success in the home market and 80% of buyers did in the first year.<ref name=\"TV20.87\">{{cite journal | ref = tv20.39 | title = Fyrhjulsstyrd | trans-title = Steering with all four | language = Swedish | journal = [[Teknikens V\u00e4rld]] | publisher = Specialtidningsf\u00f6rlaget AB | location = Stockholm, Sweden | page = 10 | date = 16 September 1987 | issue = 20 | volume = 39 | first = Dag | last = Klingstedt }}</ref>\n\nThe third-generation Prelude was exclusively powered by variants of the [[Honda B20A engine]], a base carbureted version with a SOHC 12-valve valvetrain, or a DOHC variant with Honda's [[PGM-FI]] fuel injection and 16 valves. The engine was tilted backwards by 18 degrees, which made it possible to make the hood {{convert|30|mm|in|abbr=on}} lower than on the previous generation.<ref name=\"TV20.87\"/>\n\nIt was well received by judges of the [[European Car of the Year]] accolade for 1988, finished third in a contest where the [[Peugeot 405]] was the runaway winner and the [[Citroen AX]] came second.

For reference, the 1988 [[Chevrolet Corvette (C4)|Chevrolet Corvette C4]] took the same course at {{convert|64.9|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe Prelude was ''[[Wheels magazine|Wheels magazine's]]'' [[Car of the Year]] for 1987.\n\n===Mid-cycle refresh and Prelude INX===\n{{anchor|Prelude INX}}\n[[File:PreludeSistates.jpg|right|thumb|Rare 1990 SiStates Prelude]]\n\nThe facelift third-generation Prelude was revealed in Japan on 21 November 1989. The front and rear bumpers were revised on the new Prelude. The rear front bumper and rear tail lights featured clear indicators and a revised parking light design. Many of the interior parts were also revised, including the dash bezel, the door handle and window switches. The Japanese version of the Si with the B20A was rated 140&nbsp;PS with the JDM engine and was rated for 37 MPG.\n\nAlong with the facelift, a new Prelude model was introduced to the [[Japanese domestic market]], the Prelude INX.  It featured fixed headlights, with a front fascia very similar to the contemporary [[Honda Legend#Legend coupe and other changes|Honda Legend]] coupe and [[Honda Accord#Third generation (1986\u20131989)|Honda Accord]] of the same time period. It also featured chrome trim on the headlights front and rear bumpers, side moldings, tail lights and both front and rear windscreens to enhance the focus on luxury rather than sportiness. The Prelude INX coincided with changes to North American lighting requirements in the United States and Canada, and a greater focus on safety was offered with available [[Anti-lock braking system|anti-lock brakes]] and optional [[Airbag|driver's side airbag]] exclusively offered on the Si/SR/S models.\n\nIn the US, the facelifted Prelude debuted for the 1990 model year, with the carbureted 2.0S model being discontinued. The fuel-injected 2.0Si became the entry-level model, being supplanted by a new Si model with the B21A1 engine, with Si 4WS or [[anti-lock braking system|Si ALB]] (ABS) as optional trim models. The revised version of the B20A5, called the [[Honda B20A engine#B21A1|B21A1]] was available. It was bored to {{convert|83|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} with a total displacement of 2056&nbsp;cc producing up to {{Convert|145|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and had a special cylinder liner featuring FRM (fiber reinforced metal) that is reported to be extremely tough. This causes premature piston ring wear contributing to exceptionally high oil consumption.\n\nFor the Canadian market, the S, SR and SR 4WS models were introduced for 1990. In 1991, SR ALB and SE models were introduced. The SE model was closer to the JDM and EDM models in that it was fully optioned with leather interior and was equipped with both 4WS and ALB.\n\n=== Prelude SiStates and Prelude SiTCV ===\nHonda released two new special limited edition trim models in Japan in 1989 for the facelift Prelude, the '''Prelude SiStates''' and '''Prelude SiTCV.''' These cars were a limited production run and very few were built. SiStates catalogues indicate 3000 built. They both featured standard 4WS, ALB, Viscous LSD transmissions, TCS (SiTCV only), leather-wrapped steering wheel and gear lever, extra sound-deadening insulation on the firewall and hood, and many more features that were usually options. The SiStates also featured a Japanese version of the 2.1 liter [[Honda B engine|B21A]]1 engine called the B21A rated at {{convert|150|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}}. Two major distinctions of the SiStates was that it was the same width as the Prelude sold in North America, from which it took its name, due to the wider side moldings. The other being that it was over 2.0 liters, a limitation in engine displacement in Japan for insurance reasons. The extra width and the larger engine combined to place the Prelude SiStates in a considerably higher tax bracket; while this slowed sales it also targeted some status hungry buyers. The SiStates model was only available with the MY8A LSD equipped automatic transmission. The SiTCV model was available with the MY8A automatic or the D2E4 manual 5-speed transmission.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:9091frontbumper.jpg| 90-91 Front bumper\nFile:8889tails.jpg| 88-89 Rear bumper and tail lights\nFile:9091tails.jpg| 90-91 Rear bumper and tail lights\n</gallery>\n\n==Fourth generation (1991\u20131996)==\n{{Infobox automobile\n|name=Fourth generation (BA8/9, BB1-BB4)\n|image=1996 Honda Prelude Si coupe (2015-07-09) 01.jpg\n|production=1991\u20131996\n|engine= see chart\n|wheelbase= {{convert|100.4|in|mm|0|abbr=on|order=flip}}\n|length= {{convert|174.8|in|mm|0|abbr=on|order=flip}}\n|width= {{convert|69.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on|order=flip}}\n|height= {{convert|50.8|in|mm|0|abbr=on|order=flip}}\n|weight= {{convert|2840|lb|kg|abbr=on|0|order=flip}}\n|transmission=4-speed [[automatic transmission|automatic]]<br />5-speed [[manual transmission|manual]]\n|designer = Yukio Kurosu (1989)<ref>{{cite web |title=USD347806S |url=https://patents.google.com/patent/USD347806S/en?q=automobile&q=%22our+new+design%22&assignee=honda&before=priority:19970101&after=priority:19910101 |accessdate=28 December 2019}}</ref>\n}}\n\nOn 19 September 1991, the fourth-generation Prelude was introduced in Japan, and in Europe from early 1992. The car had a 58% front and 42% rear weight distribution. The four wheel steering system was changed to an electronic version and the engine was increased in capacity from 2.1 liters to 2.2 liters for the base model \"S\" (SOHC [[Honda F engine#F22A|F22A1]] engine, {{convert|135|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} at 5200 rpm, {{convert|203|Nm|ftlbf|abbr=on}} at 4000 rpm) and \"[[VTEC]]\" model (DOHC [[VTEC]] [[Honda H engine#H22|H22A1]], {{convert|190|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} at 6800 rpm, {{convert|207|Nm|ftlbf|abbr=on}} at 5500 rpm), with a 2.3-liter for the \"Si\" (DOHC [[Honda H engine#H23|H23A1]], {{convert|160|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} at 5800 rpm, {{convert|212|Nm|ftlbf|abbr=on}} at 5300 rpm). The Japanese Si came with the [[Honda F engine#F22B|F22B]] (2.2 L DOHC non-VTEC, {{convert|160|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}). The VTEC model had an upgraded brake system, going from a 10.3\" (262&nbsp;mm) front rotor to an 11.1\" (282&nbsp;mm) front rotor and utilizing larger brake caliper and pads, similar to those found in the [[Honda Vigor]]. Its styling approach is similar to the [[Honda Ascot#Ascot Innova .28CB3.2F4.29|Honda Ascot Innova]] during the same time period.\n\nAdditionally, a 2.0i, single overhead cam (SOHC) model was released in Europe, rated at {{convert|133|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}. 1993 was the last year that the \"Si-VTEC\" (BB4) name was used, and beginning in 1994 it was shortened to just \"[[VTEC]]\" and stayed that way throughout the rest of the generation. In some countries, the Prelude with 2.2 VTEC engine was called the VTi-R. Later the 96 prelude SI/SR was introduced with a 2.3 Non-VTEC engine. In Canada, the Si was called the SR, and the VTEC was called the SR-V. Due to the width dimensions and the engine displacement exceeding [[Vehicle size class#Japan|Japanese government regulations]] for vehicles classified as \"compact\", this generation Prelude obligated Japanese owners to yearly taxes.\n\nThis model also marked the end for the pop-up headlights. The 1992 Prelude incorporated other design features that had also become the \"Prelude standard\".  The rear end was rounded and fairly high in comparison to the previous square trunk line.  The front fascia of the car became wider with fixed headlights. The glass [[moonroof]] made way for a steel sliding [[sunroof]] which no longer retracted into the car but extended out and over it.\n\nThe light blue back lighting introduced in the third generation was continued. Later models (1994 and on) also featured translucent speedometer and tachometer needles. All VTEC & SE models received leather interior. Also featured was an 8-speaker audio system (Gathers DSP 8 Speaker System) which included a center dash-mounted speaker and rear center subwoofer, while the U.S. version received only 7 speakers (center dash speaker not included). The Japanese version also included a digital climate control system. The Canadian version received some options which were not available in the United States.  For instance, the Japanese Prelude had power folding mirrors as well as a rear windscreen wiper, while the Canadian market was the one to have heated mirrors and optional heated seats.  The Japanese model came with optional Honda Access accessories such as Typus ski racks, under dash lights, headrest covers, a cabin air filter, and floor mats. Some of the Japanese domestic market fourth generation Prelude VTECs did not come with options such as a sunroof and 4-wheel steering, as it was possible to skip these options when buying in Japan. The fourth generation Prelude also shares some suspension components with the fifth generation (1994\u201397) [[Honda Accord]]. \n\n===Models and Markets===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:

layout|FF layout]] with an independent front suspension and 63/37 weight distribution. Most fifth-generation Honda Preludes came with {{convert|16|in|mm|adj=on}} [[aluminum]] alloy wheels with all-season 205/50 R16 87V tires, featured the 11.1\" front brakes like the '96 VTEC model, and most Preludes also received a five-lug hub (not the four-lug wheel hub of older models). The Prelude was only available in three models for Canada and two models for the US (the Base and Type SH). All models came with 16-inch alloy wheels and 200HP (203 PS). The 2.0i and JDM Si trims came with 195/60 R15 steel wheel, and the JDM Xi came with 14\" steel wheels. Unlike the North American market Preludes, JDM Preludes came with rear windscreen wipers, except for the Xi.\n\nThe fifth-generation Prelude marked a return to the more square bodystyle of the third generation (1987\u20131991), in an attempt to curb slumping sales of the fourth-generation bodystyle. All models and [[trim package]]s stayed within the BB-chassis code (BB5-BB9) and housed either an [[Honda H engine|H-series]] or [[Honda F engine|F-Series]] engine:\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;

this included a {{convert|5|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} bump in power for manual ({{convert|200|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} from {{convert|195|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}) and automatic ({{convert|195|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} from {{convert|190|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}) transmission models, a new front grille featuring a small \"Prelude\" badge, a cabin air filtration system, and changes to available colors.\n\n=== Canadian Market ===\nCanadian-market Preludes were very similar to US models, although all were equipped with heated seats as standard equipment, and received a 4.5L washer fluid reservoir in place of the smaller 2.5L US spec.<ref>https://justgivemethedamnmanual.com/wp-content/plugins/pdfjs-viewer-shortcode/pdfjs/web/viewer.php?file=https://justgivemethedamnmanual.com/manuals/2000_honda_prelude.pdf&download=true&print=true&openfile=false</ref> In 2001, Canada received a replacement for the Type SH, the SE trim level. The SE was mechanically identical to base models, but it came equipped with perforated, heated leather seats, Type SH [[Enkei Corporation|Enkei]] rims, Type SH spoiler, a leather-wrapped shift knob, and simulated carbon fiber trim kit on the door panels and audio panel. The SE did not receive body colored side skirts as standard like the Type SH, and also did not feature the active torque transfer system (ATTS). Dealer accessories for Canadian vehicles included: carbon fiber audio panel, sunroof visor, 6-disc-in-dash CD changer, trunk mounted CD changer, cassette player, roof rack, gold plated emblem kit, gold plated exhaust finisher, leather shift knob, full and half nose mask, security system, and a cargo mat.\n\n=== Japanese-Exclusive Type S ===\n{{Multiple image | align = right | direction = vertical | width = 220\n| image1 = 1998 Honda Prelude VTi Automatic 2.2 Rear.jpg\n| caption1 = 1998 Honda Prelude VTi\n| image2 = 1997-2001 Honda Prelude VTi-R ATTS coupe (2011-11-17) 01.jpg\n| image3 = 1997-2001 Honda Prelude VTi-R ATTS coupe (2011-11-17) 02.jpg\n| caption3 = 1997\u20132001 Honda Prelude VTi-R ATTS, Australia\n}}\nOne version of the fifth generation Prelude, a high-performance model called the '''Type S''', was only available in Japan. It was equipped with the 2.2&nbsp;L [[Honda H engine|H22A]], featuring [[VTEC]] and producing {{convert|217|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} at 7,200&nbsp;rpm and 163&nbsp;lbf\u00b7ft (221&nbsp;N\u00b7m) at 6,500&nbsp;rpm. With a compression ratio of 11.0:1, {{convert|87.0|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} bore x {{convert|90.7|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} stroke and [[VTEC]]-valve timing, lift and duration were adjusted to {{convert|12.2|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} intake and {{convert|11.2|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} exhaust. [[Honda]] also overhauled the air box and replaced it with a more efficient design that is often referred to as ''Dynamic Chambering,'' along with a larger throttle body design bored to 62&nbsp;mm (as opposed to the previous 60&nbsp;mm). The exhaust system was also treated to a redesign, with the pipe cross sections becoming more cylindrical rather than oval. The three-way catalytic converter was also increased in size, as well as the exhaust piping from 2 to 2\u00bc in (51 to 57&nbsp;mm) (tToV). In addition to a higher output engine both Type S and USDM Type SH featured an overhauled front suspension layout which offered a more effective camber curve.  The fifth generation curb weight was {{cvt|1,310|kg}}, and ground clearance was {{cvt|140|mm|in}}.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} Unlike the SiR S-spec that had an LSD, the Type S acquired the Honda technology known as the [[Active Torque Transfer System]] (ATTS). The gearing on the Type S matches all other fifth-generation Preludes that had a manual transmission except for the five-speed 2.2 VTi VTEC and had a final drive ratio of 4.266:1. The Type S had an Active Control ABS system, different from the others which had the standard ABS systems. The interior featured newly developed synthentic materials called Cabron and Excene to upholster the seats which most people perceive as leather and Alcantara laced with red stitching. Manufacturer styling options included seat lettering. The exterior styling of fifth generation Preludes was standardized for most models. All had a sunroof except for the Type S model.\n\n=== Prelude Motegi ===\nHonda also released a special edition fifth generation Prelude, called '''Motegi'''. The name of this special edition derives from the \u2018twin-ring Motegi\u2019 motor-racing circuit, located in Haga District, Tochigi, Japan. This track was built in 1997 by Honda as part of their effort to bring the IndyCar series to Japan.\n\nThe Motegi edition Prelude featured an OEM Honda body kit, 17\" Honda alloy wheels, lowered sports suspension and a Motegi badge on the trunk lid. All of these items, with the exception of the trunk lid badge, were optional on non-Motegi models.\n\n==Sales==\nSales were not strong, particularly due to competition from Honda's other offerings. The [[Honda Accord#CG|sixth-generation Accord coupe]] received an exclusive front fascia, rear tail lights, wheels and many other body panels, now being marketed alongside the Prelude with shared brochures in Canada, yet its sedan roots gave it much more utility than the comparatively cramped Prelude, and the option of a V6 engine gave North American buyers an appealing alternative. The [[Honda Civic (sixth generation)|sixth-generation Civic]] Si coupe was considerably less expensive than the Prelude as well, while also providing better fuel economy ratings. The [[Honda S2000]] was another offering that while more expensive than the Prelude, offered rear wheel drive, a six-speed transmission, 40 extra horsepower, and a convertible top.

Currently, there have been convertibles made from the first, second and fourth generation Preludes.\n\nFirst generation Preludes were modified into full convertibles by several companies in both the US, Canada and Germany. The Solaire Corporation, a southern based company in Santa Ana California owned by Al Rowland & Jim Bruemmer, lead the idea for mass market sales. He brought in craftsman Bruce Meyers (Known for the famous Meyers Manx Dune Buggy) to help design the tooling and fiberglass work for production. A believed 150 Preludes, between 1980 - 1982, were modified and sold to US Honda dealerships with full factory warranties. Dealer prices ranged from $14,000-$15,000, while the conversion itself sold around $5,000. Solaire collaborated with other companies including Classic Touch, Con-tec, Silcco, Steas Industries and National Coach. It was marketed as \"Honda's 450 SL\", drawing aesthetic comparisons to the Mercedes 450SL. \n\nTropic Design, located in [[Crailsheim]], Germany.<ref name=\"AK83\">{{cite book | title = Auto Katalog 1983 | editor-last = Heitz | editor-first = Rudolf | publisher = [[:de:Motor Presse Stuttgart|Vereinigte Motor-Verlage GmbH & Co.

Very few have remained in Europe, initially all in Germany. Some have been sold over time to nearby countries, at least one to the [[Netherlands]], one to France and one to Belgium.\n\nSecond generation Preludes were modified by another German company; some 100 Preludes were modified. No DOHC engine-equipped models have been known to be converted into convertibles, however. Three versions were available: a basic version, one which had more luxurious options, and one which added a body kit.\n\nThere is believed to be a few third generation preludes made however it is not confirmed how many were made. There is currently one confirmed Japanese imported third generation prelude currently in Australia though not much is known of its history.\n\nOf the fourth generation Preludes, only some 15 were modified into a convertible by German company Honda-Autohaus Manfred Ernst. No details are known about the engine types and other specifics. Since only 15 were ever made, they are assumed by many to be custom-built.\n\n==Scale Models==\n\n[[Corgi Toys|Corgi]] and Neo have produced 1:43 models of the first generation.<br>\n[[Minichamps]] and Neo have produced 1:43 models of the fourth generation.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Commons category|Honda Prelude}}\n{{wiktionary|prelude}}\n{{Modern Honda vehicles}}\n{{Honda}}\n\n[[Category:Honda vehicles|Prelude]]\n[[Category:Coup\u00e9s]]\n[[Category:Front-wheel-drive sports cars]]\n[[Category:Front-wheel-drive vehicles]]\n[[Category:Sport compact cars]]\n[[Category:Vehicles with four-wheel steering]]\n[[Category:1980s cars]]\n[[Category:1990s cars]]\n[[Category:2000s cars]]\n[[Category:Cars introduced in 1978]]\n[[Category:Touring cars]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2019}}\n{{Infobox automobile\n| image = 1998 Honda Prelude VTi Automatic 2.2 Front.jpg\n| name = Honda Prelude\n| caption = 1998 Honda Prelude VTi\n| manufacturer = [[Honda]]\n| production = 1978\u20132001\n| class = [[Sports car]]\n| layout = [[Front-engine, front-wheel-drive layout|Front-engine, front-wheel-drive]]\n| body_style = 2-door [[coup\u00e9]]\n| assembly = [[Sayama, Saitama]], Japan\n| successor = [[Honda Accord (North America seventh generation)#2003\u20132005|Accord Coupe (seventh generation)]]\n}}\n\nThe '''Honda Prelude''' is a [[sports car| sports]] car which was produced by Japanese car manufacturer [[Honda]] from 1978 until 2001. The two-door coupe was loosely derived from the [[Honda Accord]] and spanned five generations.

Production of the Prelude concluded in 2001 upon the introduction of the [[Honda Integra DC5]].\n\nThe Prelude name was originally trademarked by [[Toyota]], but was amicably given to Honda for use.

In Japan, the Prelude was available with a sliding metal sunroof, while US versions received a glass top which freed up more headroom.<ref name=\"WC79j\"/> Japanese buyers were liable for slightly more annual [[Road tax#Japan|road tax]]es over the smaller Civic, which also had a smaller engine.

The machine, like all Hondas, embodies fabrication that is, in my opinion, surpassed only by the narrowest of margins by Mercedes-Benz. It is a relatively powerful little automobile by anybody's standards.\" ''Motor Trend'' measured an early Prelude completing the quarter-mile in 18.8 seconds at 70&nbsp;mph. In terms of underpinnings it was mostly a Honda Accord, although its more compact package and lower weight allowed for a marginally higher top speed and gas mileage.<ref name=\"AV246\"/>\n\n[[File:Honda Prelude (14904412778).jpg|thumb|left|Rear view of SN Prelude]]\nThe standard engine at the time of introduction was the \"EL\" SOHC eight-valve 1,602&nbsp;cc (non-CVCC) [[Inline-four engine|inline-four]] rated at {{convert|80|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} at 5,000&nbsp;rpm and {{convert|12.9|kgm|Nm lbft|0|abbr=on}} at 3,500&nbsp;rpm.<ref name=\"AR80\"/> It remained the only engine available for most markets, aside from the US and Japan.

Honda used a single central gauge cluster design in this car which housed the speedometer and tachometer in one combined unit where both instrument's needles swept along the same arc. They also placed the compact AM/FM radio unit up high next to the gauge cluster. The Prelude featured intermittent wipers, tinted glass, and a remote trunk release. 1980 saw the introduction of the CVCC-II engine which employed the use of a catalytic converter and several other refinements that improved driveability, the Prelude also received a mild facelift in 1981.

The JDM [[Honda B20A engine|B20A]] produced {{convert|160|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} at 6300&nbsp;rpm, while the European B20A1 produced only {{convert|137|hp|abbr=on}}. This was the first generation of Prelude to have pop-up headlights, which allowed for a more aerodynamic front clip, reducing drag. Opening the headlights, however, especially at higher speeds, produced significantly more drag. The design retained nothing of the first generation, being considerably more aerodynamic and with large glass surfaces. As with the predecessor, it was amply equipped, with an air of \"[[Grand tourer|mini-gran turismo]]\" rather than that of a sports car.<ref name=Mon15>[[#PdL|De Leener]], p. 15</ref> It also offered, as an option, Honda's new [[Anti-lock braking system|\"A.L.B.\" anti-lock brakes]].<ref name=Moniteur/>\n\nIn Japan, the Prelude was one of the key models sold at Japanese Honda dealership sales channels, called ''[[Honda#Japan|Honda Verno]]'', which offered performance-oriented products. All ''Honda Verno'' products, like the [[Honda Vigor#Second generation (CA1-CA2-CA3)|Vigor]], initially shared the concealed headlights introduced with this generation Prelude that would help identify \"sports\" products from Honda in Japan however, the approach was short-lived. The model with the 2.0 liter engine was regarded as the top level car in Japan because Japanese buyers were liable for a higher annual [[Road tax#Japan|road tax]] over the car with the 1.8 liter engine. The Japanese 1.8 had CVCC and claimed {{convert|125|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}}, considerably more than export models.\n\nWhen the 2-liter 16-valve DOHC engine came out the hood had to be slightly modified since the larger engine could not fit under the original hood. The original 1.8-liter engine was developed specifically for the Prelude to allow a low hoodline, even tilting the engine backward to make it lower yet.<ref name=Moniteur/> The European version also saw slight modifications to the rear lights and revised front and rear bumpers which were now color-matched. Due to the fairly low weight of the car ({{convert|1025|kg|lb|abbr=on|disp=or}}) and high power (the 16-valve engine produced {{convert|160|PS|kW|0|abbr=on|disp=or}} in Japanese trim), the car was relatively nimble in comparison to its competitors, which most Preludes had not been up to that time.\n\nThe North American 1983 model is identifiable by its standard painted steel wheels with bright trim rings (although alloy rims were optional). The 1984-87 base models had Civic-style full wheel covers. In Canada, a \"Special Edition\" trim was created, which is essentially the same as the USA 2.0Si \"sport injected\" model. Fuel injection was introduced in the \"Si\" models in 1985. North American 1.8's offered {{Convert|100|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, while the later 2.0 has {{Convert|110|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nThis version of the Prelude was far more popular in Britain than its predecessor, and sold well at a time when sports cars were declining in popularity and many manufacturers were withdrawing from this market sector; including [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]], who did not replace the [[Ford Capri|Capri]] after its 1986 demise, even though it had been one of Britain's 10 most popular new cars as recently as 1980. The European lineup originally consisted of the base Prelude, without power steering, and the well-equipped EX which was also available with an automatic transmission and the A.L.B. brakes.<ref name=Moniteur/>\n\n{{gallery | width = 191 | height = 107\n|File:Prelude 2nd gen rear.jpg|1986 Honda Prelude SE Rear\n|File:1986-1987 Honda Prelude Si coupe 01.jpg|1986\u20131987 Honda Prelude Si coupe (Australia)\n|File:1986-1987 Honda Prelude Si coupe 02.jpg|1986\u20131987 Honda Prelude Si coupe (Australia)\n|File:1987 Honda Prelude side.JPG|Honda Prelude. 1987, Base 1.8L DOHC, twin carb.

Honda had expected 30% of buyers to plump for four-wheel-steering, but the car was a runaway success in the home market and 80% of buyers did in the first year.<ref name=\"TV20.87\">{{cite journal | ref = tv20.39 | title = Fyrhjulsstyrd | trans-title = Steering with all four | language = Swedish | journal = [[Teknikens V\u00e4rld]] | publisher = Specialtidningsf\u00f6rlaget AB | location = Stockholm, Sweden | page = 10 | date = 16 September 1987 | issue = 20 | volume = 39 | first = Dag | last = Klingstedt }}</ref>\n\nThe third-generation Prelude was exclusively powered by variants of the [[Honda B20A engine]], a base carbureted version with a SOHC 12-valve valvetrain, or a DOHC variant with Honda's [[PGM-FI]] fuel injection and 16 valves. The engine was tilted backwards by 18 degrees, which made it possible to make the hood {{convert|30|mm|in|abbr=on}} lower than on the previous generation.<ref name=\"TV20.87\"/>\n\nIt was well received by judges of the [[European Car of the Year]] accolade for 1988, finished third in a contest where the [[Peugeot 405]] was the runaway winner and the [[Citroen AX]] came second. This was one of the best performances by a [[Japan]]ese built or branded car until the [[Nissan Micra]] won the award five years later.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|Third-generation Honda Prelude engines:<br />\n'''B20A/B20A1''' - 2.0L DOHC PGM-FI 160/143&nbsp;PS (Japan/Europe) <br />\n'''B20A3''' - 2.0L SOHC 12v carb 104&nbsp;hp North America<br />\n'''B20A4''' - 2.0L SOHC 12v carb {{convert|114|PS|abbr=on}}Global, except North America<br />\n'''B20A5''' - 2.0L DOHC PGM-FI {{convert|135|hp|abbr=on}} North America<br />\n'''B20A6''' - 2.0L DOHC PGM-FI {{convert|142|PS|abbr=on}} Oceania<br />\n'''B20A7''' - 2.0L DOHC PGM-FI {{convert|150|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} Europe<br />\n'''B20A8''' - 2.0L DOHC PGM-FI {{convert|133|PS|abbr=on}} Europe<br />\n'''B20A9''' - 2.0L DOHC PGM-FI {{convert|140|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} Europe<br />\n'''B21A''' - 2.1L DOHC PGM-FI {{convert|145|PS|abbr=on}} Japan (SI States)<br />\n'''B21A1''' - 2.1L DOHC PGM-FI {{convert|140|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} North America<br />\n|}\n\nIn 1987, ''[[Road & Track]]'' published a test summary that shows the 1988 Honda Prelude 2.0Si 4WS outperforming every car of that year on the slalom, with a speed of {{convert|65.5|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}, even besting exotics such as [[Porsche]] and [[Ferrari]]. For reference, the 1988 [[Chevrolet Corvette (C4)|Chevrolet Corvette C4]] took the same course at {{convert|64.9|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe Prelude was ''[[Wheels magazine|Wheels magazine's]]'' [[Car of the Year]] for 1987.\n\n===Mid-cycle refresh and Prelude INX===\n{{anchor|Prelude INX}}\n[[File:PreludeSistates.jpg|right|thumb|Rare 1990 SiStates Prelude]]\n\nThe facelift third-generation Prelude was revealed in Japan on 21 November 1989. The front and rear bumpers were revised on the new Prelude. The rear front bumper and rear tail lights featured clear indicators and a revised parking light design. Many of the interior parts were also revised, including the dash bezel, the door handle and window switches. The Japanese version of the Si with the B20A was rated 140&nbsp;PS with the JDM engine and was rated for 37 MPG.\n\nAlong with the facelift, a new Prelude model was introduced to the [[Japanese domestic market]], the Prelude INX.  It featured fixed headlights, with a front fascia very similar to the contemporary [[Honda Legend#Legend coupe and other changes|Honda Legend]] coupe and [[Honda Accord#Third generation (1986\u20131989)|Honda Accord]] of the same time period. It also featured chrome trim on the headlights front and rear bumpers, side moldings, tail lights and both front and rear windscreens to enhance the focus on luxury rather than sportiness. The Prelude INX coincided with changes to North American lighting requirements in the United States and Canada, and a greater focus on safety was offered with available [[Anti-lock braking system|anti-lock brakes]] and optional [[Airbag|driver's side airbag]] exclusively offered on the Si/SR/S models.\n\nIn the US, the facelifted Prelude debuted for the 1990 model year, with the carbureted 2.0S model being discontinued. The fuel-injected 2.0Si became the entry-level model, being supplanted by a new Si model with the B21A1 engine, with Si 4WS or [[anti-lock braking system|Si ALB]] (ABS) as optional trim models. The revised version of the B20A5, called the [[Honda B20A engine#B21A1|B21A1]] was available. It was bored to {{convert|83|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} with a total displacement of 2056&nbsp;cc producing up to {{Convert|145|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and had a special cylinder liner featuring FRM (fiber reinforced metal) that is reported to be extremely tough. This causes premature piston ring wear contributing to exceptionally high oil consumption.\n\nFor the Canadian market, the S, SR and SR 4WS models were introduced for 1990. In 1991, SR ALB and SE models were introduced. The SE model was closer to the JDM and EDM models in that it was fully optioned with leather interior and was equipped with both 4WS and ALB.\n\n=== Prelude SiStates and Prelude SiTCV ===\nHonda released two new special limited edition trim models in Japan in 1989 for the facelift Prelude, the '''Prelude SiStates''' and '''Prelude SiTCV.''' These cars were a limited production run and very few were built. SiStates catalogues indicate 3000 built. They both featured standard 4WS, ALB, Viscous LSD transmissions, TCS (SiTCV only), leather-wrapped steering wheel and gear lever, extra sound-deadening insulation on the firewall and hood, and many more features that were usually options. The SiStates also featured a Japanese version of the 2.1 liter [[Honda B engine|B21A]]1 engine called the B21A rated at {{convert|150|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}}. Two major distinctions of the SiStates was that it was the same width as the Prelude sold in North America, from which it took its name, due to the wider side moldings. The other being that it was over 2.0 liters, a limitation in engine displacement in Japan for insurance reasons. The extra width and the larger engine combined to place the Prelude SiStates in a considerably higher tax bracket; while this slowed sales it also targeted some status hungry buyers. The SiStates model was only available with the MY8A LSD equipped automatic transmission. The SiTCV model was available with the MY8A automatic or the D2E4 manual 5-speed transmission.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:9091frontbumper.jpg| 90-91 Front bumper\nFile:8889tails.jpg| 88-89 Rear bumper and tail lights\nFile:9091tails.jpg| 90-91 Rear bumper and tail lights\n</gallery>\n\n==Fourth generation (1991\u20131996)==\n{{Infobox automobile\n|name=Fourth generation (BA8/9, BB1-BB4)\n|image=1996 Honda Prelude Si coupe (2015-07-09) 01.jpg\n|production=1991\u20131996\n|engine= see chart\n|wheelbase= {{convert|100.4|in|mm|0|abbr=on|order=flip}}\n|length= {{convert|174.8|in|mm|0|abbr=on|order=flip}}\n|width= {{convert|69.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on|order=flip}}\n|height= {{convert|50.8|in|mm|0|abbr=on|order=flip}}\n|weight= {{convert|2840|lb|kg|abbr=on|0|order=flip}}\n|transmission=4-speed [[automatic transmission|automatic]]<br />5-speed [[manual transmission|manual]]\n|designer = Yukio Kurosu (1989)<ref>{{cite web |title=USD347806S |url=https://patents.google.com/patent/USD347806S/en?q=automobile&q=%22our+new+design%22&assignee=honda&before=priority:19970101&after=priority:19910101 |accessdate=28 December 2019}}</ref>\n}}\n\nOn 19 September 1991, the fourth-generation Prelude was introduced in Japan, and in Europe from early 1992. The car had a 58% front and 42% rear weight distribution. The four wheel steering system was changed to an electronic version and the engine was increased in capacity from 2.1 liters to 2.2 liters for the base model \"S\" (SOHC [[Honda F engine#F22A|F22A1]] engine, {{convert|135|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} at 5200 rpm, {{convert|203|Nm|ftlbf|abbr=on}} at 4000 rpm) and \"[[VTEC]]\" model (DOHC [[VTEC]] [[Honda H engine#H22|H22A1]], {{convert|190|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} at 6800 rpm, {{convert|207|Nm|ftlbf|abbr=on}} at 5500 rpm), with a 2.3-liter for the \"Si\" (DOHC [[Honda H engine#H23|H23A1]], {{convert|160|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} at 5800 rpm, {{convert|212|Nm|ftlbf|abbr=on}} at 5300 rpm). The Japanese Si came with the [[Honda F engine#F22B|F22B]] (2.2 L DOHC non-VTEC, {{convert|160|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}). The VTEC model had an upgraded brake system, going from a 10.3\" (262&nbsp;mm) front rotor to an 11.1\" (282&nbsp;mm) front rotor and utilizing larger brake caliper and pads, similar to those found in the [[Honda Vigor]]. Its styling approach is similar to the [[Honda Ascot#Ascot Innova .28CB3.2F4.29|Honda Ascot Innova]] during the same time period.\n\nAdditionally, a 2.0i, single overhead cam (SOHC) model was released in Europe, rated at {{convert|133|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}. 1993 was the last year that the \"Si-VTEC\" (BB4) name was used, and beginning in 1994 it was shortened to just \"[[VTEC]]\" and stayed that way throughout the rest of the generation. In some countries, the Prelude with 2.2 VTEC engine was called the VTi-R. Later the 96 prelude SI/SR was introduced with a 2.3 Non-VTEC engine. In Canada, the Si was called the SR, and the VTEC was called the SR-V. Due to the width dimensions and the engine displacement exceeding [[Vehicle size class#Japan|Japanese government regulations]] for vehicles classified as \"compact\", this generation Prelude obligated Japanese owners to yearly taxes.\n\nThis model also marked the end for the pop-up headlights. The 1992 Prelude incorporated other design features that had also become the \"Prelude standard\".  The rear end was rounded and fairly high in comparison to the previous square trunk line.  The front fascia of the car became wider with fixed headlights. The glass [[moonroof]] made way for a steel sliding [[sunroof]] which no longer retracted into the car but extended out and over it.\n\nThe light blue back lighting introduced in the third generation was continued. Later models (1994 and on) also featured translucent speedometer and tachometer needles. All VTEC & SE models received leather interior. Also featured was an 8-speaker audio system (Gathers DSP 8 Speaker System) which included a center dash-mounted speaker and rear center subwoofer, while the U.S. version received only 7 speakers (center dash speaker not included). The Japanese version also included a digital climate control system. The Canadian version received some options which were not available in the United States.  For instance, the Japanese Prelude had power folding mirrors as well as a rear windscreen wiper, while the Canadian market was the one to have heated mirrors and optional heated seats.  The Japanese model came with optional Honda Access accessories such as Typus ski racks, under dash lights, headrest covers, a cabin air filter, and floor mats. Some of the Japanese domestic market fourth generation Prelude VTECs did not come with options such as a sunroof and 4-wheel steering, as it was possible to skip these options when buying in Japan. The fourth generation Prelude also shares some suspension components with the fifth generation (1994\u201397) [[Honda Accord]]. \n\n===Models and Markets===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:

layout|FF layout]] with an independent front suspension and 63/37 weight distribution. Most fifth-generation Honda Preludes came with {{convert|16|in|mm|adj=on}} [[aluminum]] alloy wheels with all-season 205/50 R16 87V tires, featured the 11.1\" front brakes like the '96 VTEC model, and most Preludes also received a five-lug hub (not the four-lug wheel hub of older models). The Prelude was only available in three models for Canada and two models for the US (the Base and Type SH). All models came with 16-inch alloy wheels and 200HP (203 PS). The 2.0i and JDM Si trims came with 195/60 R15 steel wheel, and the JDM Xi came with 14\" steel wheels. Unlike the North American market Preludes, JDM Preludes came with rear windscreen wipers, except for the Xi.\n\nThe fifth-generation Prelude marked a return to the more square bodystyle of the third generation (1987\u20131991), in an attempt to curb slumping sales of the fourth-generation bodystyle. All models and [[trim package]]s stayed within the BB-chassis code (BB5-BB9) and housed either an [[Honda H engine|H-series]] or [[Honda F engine|F-Series]] engine:\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;

this included a {{convert|5|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} bump in power for manual ({{convert|200|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} from {{convert|195|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}) and automatic ({{convert|195|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} from {{convert|190|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}) transmission models, a new front grille featuring a small \"Prelude\" badge, a cabin air filtration system, and changes to available colors.\n\n=== Canadian Market ===\nCanadian-market Preludes were very similar to US models, although all were equipped with heated seats as standard equipment, and received a 4.5L washer fluid reservoir in place of the smaller 2.5L US spec.<ref>https://justgivemethedamnmanual.com/wp-content/plugins/pdfjs-viewer-shortcode/pdfjs/web/viewer.php?file=https://justgivemethedamnmanual.com/manuals/2000_honda_prelude.pdf&download=true&print=true&openfile=false</ref> In 2001, Canada received a replacement for the Type SH, the SE trim level. The SE was mechanically identical to base models, but it came equipped with perforated, heated leather seats, Type SH [[Enkei Corporation|Enkei]] rims, Type SH spoiler, a leather-wrapped shift knob, and simulated carbon fiber trim kit on the door panels and audio panel. The SE did not receive body colored side skirts as standard like the Type SH, and also did not feature the active torque transfer system (ATTS). Dealer accessories for Canadian vehicles included: carbon fiber audio panel, sunroof visor, 6-disc-in-dash CD changer, trunk mounted CD changer, cassette player, roof rack, gold plated emblem kit, gold plated exhaust finisher, leather shift knob, full and half nose mask, security system, and a cargo mat.\n\n=== Japanese-Exclusive Type S ===\n{{Multiple image | align = right | direction = vertical | width = 220\n| image1 = 1998 Honda Prelude VTi Automatic 2.2 Rear.jpg\n| caption1 = 1998 Honda Prelude VTi\n| image2 = 1997-2001 Honda Prelude VTi-R ATTS coupe (2011-11-17) 01.jpg\n| image3 = 1997-2001 Honda Prelude VTi-R ATTS coupe (2011-11-17) 02.jpg\n| caption3 = 1997\u20132001 Honda Prelude VTi-R ATTS, Australia\n}}\nOne version of the fifth generation Prelude, a high-performance model called the '''Type S''', was only available in Japan. It was equipped with the 2.2&nbsp;L [[Honda H engine|H22A]], featuring [[VTEC]] and producing {{convert|217|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} at 7,200&nbsp;rpm and 163&nbsp;lbf\u00b7ft (221&nbsp;N\u00b7m) at 6,500&nbsp;rpm. With a compression ratio of 11.0:1, {{convert|87.0|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} bore x {{convert|90.7|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} stroke and [[VTEC]]-valve timing, lift and duration were adjusted to {{convert|12.2|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} intake and {{convert|11.2|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} exhaust. [[Honda]] also overhauled the air box and replaced it with a more efficient design that is often referred to as ''Dynamic Chambering,'' along with a larger throttle body design bored to 62&nbsp;mm (as opposed to the previous 60&nbsp;mm). The exhaust system was also treated to a redesign, with the pipe cross sections becoming more cylindrical rather than oval. The three-way catalytic converter was also increased in size, as well as the exhaust piping from 2 to 2\u00bc in (51 to 57&nbsp;mm) (tToV). In addition to a higher output engine both Type S and USDM Type SH featured an overhauled front suspension layout which offered a more effective camber curve.  The fifth generation curb weight was {{cvt|1,310|kg}}, and ground clearance was {{cvt|140|mm|in}}.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} Unlike the SiR S-spec that had an LSD, the Type S acquired the Honda technology known as the [[Active Torque Transfer System]] (ATTS). The gearing on the Type S matches all other fifth-generation Preludes that had a manual transmission except for the five-speed 2.2 VTi VTEC and had a final drive ratio of 4.266:1. The Type S had an Active Control ABS system, different from the others which had the standard ABS systems. The interior featured newly developed synthentic materials called Cabron and Excene to upholster the seats which most people perceive as leather and Alcantara laced with red stitching. Manufacturer styling options included seat lettering. The exterior styling of fifth generation Preludes was standardized for most models. All had a sunroof except for the Type S model.\n\n=== Prelude Motegi ===\nHonda also released a special edition fifth generation Prelude, called '''Motegi'''. The name of this special edition derives from the \u2018twin-ring Motegi\u2019 motor-racing circuit, located in Haga District, Tochigi, Japan. This track was built in 1997 by Honda as part of their effort to bring the IndyCar series to Japan.\n\nThe Motegi edition Prelude featured an OEM Honda body kit, 17\" Honda alloy wheels, lowered sports suspension and a Motegi badge on the trunk lid. All of these items, with the exception of the trunk lid badge, were optional on non-Motegi models.\n\n==Sales==\nSales were not strong, particularly due to competition from Honda's other offerings. The [[Honda Accord#CG|sixth-generation Accord coupe]] received an exclusive front fascia, rear tail lights, wheels and many other body panels, now being marketed alongside the Prelude with shared brochures in Canada, yet its sedan roots gave it much more utility than the comparatively cramped Prelude, and the option of a V6 engine gave North American buyers an appealing alternative. The [[Honda Civic (sixth generation)|sixth-generation Civic]] Si coupe was considerably less expensive than the Prelude as well, while also providing better fuel economy ratings. The [[Honda S2000]] was another offering that while more expensive than the Prelude, offered rear wheel drive, a six-speed transmission, 40 extra horsepower, and a convertible top. The exterior dimensions of the Prelude were no longer in compliance with [[Vehicle size class#Japan|Japanese government regulations]], and the additional costs resulting from this contributed to the popularity of smaller Honda products.

Currently, there have been convertibles made from the first, second and fourth generation Preludes.\n\nFirst generation Preludes were modified into full convertibles by several companies in both the US, Canada and Germany. The Solaire Corporation, a southern based company in Santa Ana California owned by Al Rowland & Jim Bruemmer, lead the idea for mass market sales. He brought in craftsman Bruce Meyers (Known for the famous Meyers Manx Dune Buggy) to help design the tooling and fiberglass work for production. A believed 150 Preludes, between 1980 - 1982, were modified and sold to US Honda dealerships with full factory warranties. Dealer prices ranged from $14,000-$15,000, while the conversion itself sold around $5,000. Solaire collaborated with other companies including Classic Touch, Con-tec, Silcco, Steas Industries and National Coach. It was marketed as \"Honda's 450 SL\", drawing aesthetic comparisons to the Mercedes 450SL. \n\nTropic Design, located in [[Crailsheim]], Germany.<ref name=\"AK83\">{{cite book | title = Auto Katalog 1983 | editor-last = Heitz | editor-first = Rudolf | publisher = [[:de:Motor Presse Stuttgart|Vereinigte Motor-Verlage GmbH & Co. KG]] | location = Stuttgart | page = 47 | volume = 26 | language = German | year = 1982 }}</ref> Company owner J\u00fcrgen Weber learned this trade in the United States.<ref name=\"AK83\"/> In all, they modified 47 Preludes, most of which were exported to the US, where Weber had connections. Very few have remained in Europe, initially all in Germany. Some have been sold over time to nearby countries, at least one to the [[Netherlands]], one to France and one to Belgium.\n\nSecond generation Preludes were modified by another German company; some 100 Preludes were modified. No DOHC engine-equipped models have been known to be converted into convertibles, however. Three versions were available: a basic version, one which had more luxurious options, and one which added a body kit.\n\nThere is believed to be a few third generation preludes made however it is not confirmed how many were made. There is currently one confirmed Japanese imported third generation prelude currently in Australia though not much is known of its history.\n\nOf the fourth generation Preludes, only some 15 were modified into a convertible by German company Honda-Autohaus Manfred Ernst. No details are known about the engine types and other specifics. Since only 15 were ever made, they are assumed by many to be custom-built.\n\n==Scale Models==\n\n[[Corgi Toys|Corgi]] and Neo have produced 1:43 models of the first generation.<br>\n[[Minichamps]] and Neo have produced 1:43 models of the fourth generation.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Commons category|Honda Prelude}}\n{{wiktionary|prelude}}\n{{Modern Honda vehicles}}\n{{Honda}}\n\n[[Category:Honda vehicles|Prelude]]\n[[Category:Coup\u00e9s]]\n[[Category:Front-wheel-drive sports cars]]\n[[Category:Front-wheel-drive vehicles]]\n[[Category:Sport compact cars]]\n[[Category:Vehicles with four-wheel steering]]\n[[Category:1970s cars]]\n[[Category:1980s cars]]\n[[Category:1990s cars]]\n[[Category:2000s cars]]\n[[Category:Cars introduced in 1978]]\n[[Category:Touring cars]]\n", "name_user": "TKOIII", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eScale Models:Removed redundant category as per WP:Subcat.
