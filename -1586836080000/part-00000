It tells the story of a woman trying to protect her young daughter from the horrors of war. The film stars [[Sophia Loren]], [[Jean-Paul Belmondo]], [[Raf Vallone]], [[Eleonora Brown]], [[Carlo Ninchi]], and [[Andrea Checchi]]. The film was adapted by De Sica and [[Cesare Zavattini]] from the [[Two women (novel)|novel of the same name]] written by [[Alberto Moravia]]. The story is fictional, but based on actual events of July 1944 in Rome and rural [[Lazio]], during what Italians call the ''[[Marocchinate]]''.<ref>[http://www.cassino2000.com/cdsc/studi/archivio/n07/n07p09.html 1952: Il caso delle \u201cmarocchinate\u201d al Parlamento] Accessed 9 December 2017</ref>\n\nLoren's performance received critical acclaim, winning her the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]] among other accolades.\n\n==Plot==\nCesira (Loren) is a widowed shopkeeper, raising her devoutly religious twelve-year-old daughter, Rosetta (Brown), in Rome during [[World War II]]. In July 1943, following the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] [[Bombing of Rome in World War II#July 19, 1943|bombing of Rome]], mother and daughter flee to Cesira's native [[Ciociaria]], a rural, mountainous province of central Italy. The night before they go, Cesira sleeps with Giovanni (Vallone), a coal dealer in her neighbourhood, who agrees to look after her store in her absence.\n\nAfter they arrive at Ciociaria, Cesira attracts the attention of Michele (Belmondo), a young local intellectual with [[communist]] sympathies. Rosetta sees Michele as a father figure and develops a strong bond with him. Michele is later taken prisoner by [[Wehrmacht|German soldiers]], who force him to act as a guide through the mountainous terrain.\n\nAfter the Allies capture Rome, in June 1944, Cesira and Rosetta decide to head back to that city. On the way, the two are gang-raped inside a church by a group of ''[[Moroccan Goumier]]s'' &ndash; soldiers attached to the invading [[Allied Armies in Italy]]. Rosetta is traumatized, becoming detached and distant from her mother and no longer an innocent child.\n\nWhen the two manage to find shelter at a neighbouring village, Rosetta disappears during the night, sending Cesira into a panic. She thinks Rosetta has gone to look for Michele, but later finds out that Michele was killed by the Germans. Rosetta returns, having been out with an older boy, who has given her silk stockings, despite her youth. Cesira is outraged and upset, slapping and spanking Rosetta for her behavior, but Rosetta remains unresponsive, emotionally distant. When Cesira informs Rosetta of Michele's death, Rosetta begins to cry like the little girl she had been prior to the rape. The film ends with Cesira comforting the child.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Sophia Loren]] as Cesira\n* [[Jean-Paul Belmondo]] as Michele Di Libero\n* [[Eleonora Brown]] as Rosetta\n* [[Carlo Ninchi]] as Filippo, Michele's father\n* [[Raf Vallone]] as Giovanni\n* [[Andrea Checchi]] as A fascist\n* [[Pupella Maggio]] as Peasant\n* Bruna Cealti as Refugee\n* Antonella Della Porta as A crazy mother\n* Mario Frera\n* [[Franco Balducci]] as German in the haystack\n* Luciana Cortellesi\n* [[Curt Lowens]]\n* Tony Calio\n* Remo Galavotti\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nThe film was based on a 1957 novel by [[Alberto Moravia]], ''La ciociara'' (''The Woman From Ciociaria''). It was inspired by Moravia's experiences during World War II.\n\n[[Carlo Ponti]] bought the film rights along with Marcello Girosi for a reported US$100,000. Sophia Loren was always meant to star and there was some talk that the film might be financed by Paramount, with whom Loren had made a number of movies.<ref>{{cite news|title=JAPANESE MOVIE WILL BE ADAPTED: Alciona, U.

It tells the story of a woman trying to protect her young daughter from the horrors of war. The film stars [[Sophia Loren]], [[Jean-Paul Belmondo]], [[Raf Vallone]], [[Eleonora Brown]], [[Carlo Ninchi]], and [[Andrea Checchi]]. The film was adapted by De Sica and [[Cesare Zavattini]] from the [[Two women (novel)|novel of the same name]] written by [[Alberto Moravia]]. The story is fictional, but based on actual events of July 1943 in Rome and rural [[Lazio]], during what Italians call the ''[[Marocchinate]]''.<ref>[http://www.cassino2000.com/cdsc/studi/archivio/n07/n07p09.html 1952: Il caso delle \u201cmarocchinate\u201d al Parlamento] Accessed 9 December 2017</ref>\n\nLoren's performance received critical acclaim, winning her the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]] among other accolades.\n\n==Plot==\nCesira (Loren) is a widowed shopkeeper, raising her devoutly religious twelve-year-old daughter, Rosetta (Brown), in Rome during [[World War II]]. In July 1943, following the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] [[Bombing of Rome in World War II#July 19, 1943|bombing of Rome]], mother and daughter flee to Cesira's native [[Ciociaria]], a rural, mountainous province of central Italy. The night before they go, Cesira sleeps with Giovanni (Vallone), a coal dealer in her neighbourhood, who agrees to look after her store in her absence.\n\nAfter they arrive at Ciociaria, Cesira attracts the attention of Michele (Belmondo), a young local intellectual with [[communist]] sympathies. Rosetta sees Michele as a father figure and develops a strong bond with him. Michele is later taken prisoner by [[Wehrmacht|German soldiers]], who force him to act as a guide through the mountainous terrain.\n\nAfter the Allies capture Rome, in June 1944, Cesira and Rosetta decide to head back to that city. On the way, the two are gang-raped inside a church by a group of ''[[Moroccan Goumier]]s'' &ndash; soldiers attached to the invading [[Allied Armies in Italy]]. Rosetta is traumatized, becoming detached and distant from her mother and no longer an innocent child.\n\nWhen the two manage to find shelter at a neighbouring village, Rosetta disappears during the night, sending Cesira into a panic. She thinks Rosetta has gone to look for Michele, but later finds out that Michele was killed by the Germans. Rosetta returns, having been out with an older boy, who has given her silk stockings, despite her youth. Cesira is outraged and upset, slapping and spanking Rosetta for her behavior, but Rosetta remains unresponsive, emotionally distant. When Cesira informs Rosetta of Michele's death, Rosetta begins to cry like the little girl she had been prior to the rape. The film ends with Cesira comforting the child.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Sophia Loren]] as Cesira\n* [[Jean-Paul Belmondo]] as Michele Di Libero\n* [[Eleonora Brown]] as Rosetta\n* [[Carlo Ninchi]] as Filippo, Michele's father\n* [[Raf Vallone]] as Giovanni\n* [[Andrea Checchi]] as A fascist\n* [[Pupella Maggio]] as Peasant\n* Bruna Cealti as Refugee\n* Antonella Della Porta as A crazy mother\n* Mario Frera\n* [[Franco Balducci]] as German in the haystack\n* Luciana Cortellesi\n* [[Curt Lowens]]\n* Tony Calio\n* Remo Galavotti\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nThe film was based on a 1957 novel by [[Alberto Moravia]], ''La ciociara'' (''The Woman From Ciociaria'').

{"title_page": "Edward Ambrose Burgis", "text_new": "'''Edward Ambrose Burgis''' was an English Dominican historian and theologian.\n\n==Biography==\nHe was born in England {{circa}}1673. When a young man he left the [[Church of England]], of which his father was a minister, and became a Catholic, joining the [[Dominican Order]] at Rome, where he passed his [[novic]]eship in the convent of Saints John and Paul on the [[Caelian Hill]], then occupied by the English Dominicans. After his religious profession (1696) he was sent to [[Naples]] to the Dominican school of St. Thomas, where he displayed unusual mental ability.\n \nUpon the completion of his studies he was sent to the Flemish university of [[Leuven|Louvain]], where for nearly thirty years he taught philosophy, theology, Sacred Scripture and church history in the College of St. Thomas, established in 1697 for the Dominicans of England through the bequest of [[Cardinal Thomas Howard]], [[Ordo Praedicatorum|O.P.]] He was the [[Rector (academia)|rector]] of the college from 1715 to 1720 and again from 1724 to 1730. In the latter year he was elected to the office of [[provincial superior]]; in 1741 he became [[Prior]] of the English Dominican convent at [[Bornhem]], and in 1746 he was appointed [[Vicar general]] of the English Dominicans in [[Belgium]].

These users specialize in flaming and target specific aspects of a controversial conversation.\n\nWhile these behaviors may be typical and/or expected in certain types of forums, they can have dramatic, adverse effects in others. Flame wars can have a everlasting impact on some internet communities where even once a flame war has concluded a division or even dissolution may occur.<ref name=\"Ashlee. 20162\" />\n\nThe pleasant commentaries within a chat room or message board can be limited by a \"war of words\" fight or \"flaming\" with the intent to seek out a negative reaction from the receiver. Humphrey defines flaming as \u201cthe use of hostile language online, including swearing, insults and otherwise offensive language\u201d.<ref name=\"Ashlee. 20162\" /> Flaming by crimina within the online community is commonly received by messaging through text and rarely by face to face or video communication. By basing their conversations on text and not taking full accountability as the \u2018flamer\u2019, they have a reduced self-awareness of others feelings, emotions and reactions based on the comments that they provide within the virtual community. The reader now has the perception that this \u2018flamer\u2019 is difficult, rude and possibly a bully. The flamer may have limited social cues, emotional intelligence to adapt to others reactions and lack of awareness of how they are being perceived. Their personal social norms, may considered disrespectful to the reader that has different social norms, education and experience with what is and is not appropriate within virtual communities.\n\nThe individuals that create an environment of flaming and hostility, lead the readers to disengage with the offender and may potentially leave the message board and chat room. By leaving the flaming situation, the reader has reacted calmly with limited misinterpretations. The continual use of flaming within the online community can create a disruptive and negative experience for those involved and can lead to limited involvement and engagement within the original chat room and program.<ref>https://www.theguardian.com/global/commentisfree/2019/dec/31/childlessness-pot-shots-may-have-worked-with-julia-gillard-but-there-is-rage-over-princess-palaszczuk</ref>\n\n==Purpose==\n[[Social science|Social researchers]] have investigated flaming, coming up with several different theories about the phenomenon.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=P.J.

Furthermore, within a single individual, mental models change with time, even during the flow of a single conversation. The human mind assembles a few relationships to fit the context of a discussion. As debate shifts, so do the mental models. Even when only a single topic is being discussed, each participant in a conversation employs a different mental model to interpret the subject. Fundamental assumptions differ but are never brought into the open. Goals are different but left unstated. It is little wonder that compromise takes so long. And even when consensus is reached, the underlying assumptions may be fallacies that lead to laws and programs that fail. The human mind is not adapted to understanding correctly the consequences implied by a mental model. A mental model may be correct in structure and assumptions but, even so, the human mind\u2014either individually or as a group consensus\u2014is apt to draw the wrong implications for the future.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sysdyn.clexchange.org/sdep/Roadmaps/RM1/D-4468-2.pdf|title=Counterintuitive Behavior of Social Systems|author=Jay W. Forrester|year=1971|publisher=[[MIT]] System Dynamics in Education Project|page=4| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090823210010/http://sysdyn.clexchange.org/sdep/Roadmaps/RM1/D-4468-2.pdf| archivedate=23 August 2009|url-status=dead|accessdate=2009-09-03|df=dmy}}</ref></blockquote>Thus, online conversations often involve a variety of assumptions and motives unique to each individual user. Without social context, users are often helpless to know the intentions of their counterparts. In addition to the problems of conflicting mental models often present in online discussions, the inherent lack of face-to-face communication online can encourage hostility. Professor Norman Johnson, commenting on the propensity of Internet posters to flame one another, states:<blockquote>The literature suggests that, compared to face-to-face, the increased incidence of flaming when using [[computer-mediated communication]] is due to reductions in the transfer of social cues, which decrease individuals' concern for social evaluation and fear of social sanctions or reprisals. When social identity and ingroup status are salient, computer mediation can decrease flaming because individuals focus their attention on the social context (and associated norms) rather than themselves.<ref name=\"Johnson2\">{{cite journal|last=Johnson|first=Norman A.|year=2009|title=Anger and flaming in computer-mediated negotiations among strangers|journal=Decision Support Systems|volume=46|issue=3|pages=660\u2013672|doi=10.1016/j.dss.2008.10.008}}</ref></blockquote>A lack of [[social context]] creates an element of anonymity, which allows users to feel insulated from the forms of punishment they might receive in a more conventional setting. Johnson identifies several precursors to flaming between users, whom he refers to as \"negotiation partners,\" since Internet communication typically involves back-and-forth interactions similar to a negotiation. Flaming incidents usually arise in response to a perception of one or more negotiation partners being unfair. Perceived unfairness can include a lack of consideration for an individual's vested interests, unfavorable treatment (especially when the flamer has been considerate of other users), and misunderstandings aggravated by the inability to convey subtle indicators like [[non-verbal]] cues and [[facial expression]]s.<ref name=\"Johnson2\" />\n\n== Factors ==\nThere are multiple factors that play into why people would get involved with flaming. For instance, there is the anonymity factor and that people can use different means to have their identity hidden.<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite journal|last=Hutchens|first=Myiah J|last2=Cicchirillo|first2=Vincent J|last3=Hmielowski|first3=Jay D|date=2014-02-12|title=How could you think that?!?!: Understanding intentions to engage in political flaming|journal=New Media & Society|language=en|volume=17|issue=8|pages=1201\u20131219|doi=10.1177/1461444814522947|issn=1461-4448}}</ref> Through the hiding of one's identity people can build a new persona and act in a way that they normally would not when they have their identity known. Another factor in flaming is proactive aggression \"which is initiated without perceived threat or provocation\" and those who are recipients of flaming may counter with flaming of their own and utilize reactive aggression.<ref name=\":02\"/> Another factor that goes into flaming are the different communication variables. For instance, offline communications networks can impact the way people act online and can lead them to engage in flaming.<ref name=\":02\"/> Finally, there is the factor of verbal aggression and how people who engage in verbal aggression will use those tactics when they engage in flaming online.<ref name=\":02\"/>\n\n[[Randal Munroe]], engineer, scientific theorist, and cartoonist of [[XKCD]], has summarized reasons for the use of flaming and [[flame wars]] succinctly, in \"Duty Calls\" [https://xkcd.com/386/], \"Bad Opinions\" [https://xkcd.com/2051/], and \"Old Timers\" [https://xkcd.com/1058/].\n\nFlaming can range from subtle to extremely aggressive in online behaviors. Derogatory images, certain emojis used in combination, and even the use of capital letters. These things can show a pattern of behavior used to convey certain emotions online. Victims should do their best to avoid fighting back in an attempt to prevent a war of words. Flaming extends past social media interactions. Flaming can also take place through emails, and it may not matter so much whether someone calls an email a \u201cflame,\u201d is based on whether she or he considers an email to be hostile, aggressive, insulting, or offensive. What matters is how the person receives the interaction. So much is lost in translation when communicating online versus in person, that it is hard to distinguish someone's intent.<ref name=\":26\">Anna K. Turnage, Email Flaming Behaviors and Organizational Conflict, Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication, Volume 13, Issue 1, 1 October 2007, Pages 43\u201359, https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1083-6101.2007.00385.x</ref>\n\n==History==\nEvidence of debates which resulted in insults being exchanged quickly back and forth between two parties can be found throughout history. Arguments over the ratification of the [[United States Constitution]] were often socially and emotionally heated and intense, with many attacking one another through local newspapers. Such interactions have always been part of literary criticism. For example, [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]]'s contempt for [[Jane Austen]]'s works often extended to the author herself, with Emerson describing her as \"without genius, wit, or knowledge of the world\". In turn, [[Thomas Carlyle]] called Emerson a \"hoary-headed toothless baboon\"<ref name=\"reid\">{{cite journal |last1=Goldsborough |first1=Reid |title=How to Respond to Flames (without Getting Singled) |journal=Information Today |date=February 2005 |volume=22 |issue=2}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[modern era]], \"flaming\" was used at East Coast [[engineering]] schools in the United States as a present participle in a crude expression to describe an irascible individual and by extension to such individuals on the earliest [[Internet]] chat rooms and [[message board]]s. Internet flaming was mostly observed in [[Usenet]] newsgroups although it was known to occur in the [[WWIVnet]] and [[FidoNet]] computer networks as well. It was subsequently used in other parts of speech with much the same meaning.\n\nThe term \"flaming\" was seen on [[Usenet]] newsgroups in the eighties, where the start of a flame was sometimes indicated by typing \"FLAME ON\", then \"FLAME OFF\" when the flame section of the post was complete. This is a reference to both The Human Torch of the [[Fantastic Four]], who used those words when activating his flame abilities, and to the way [[text processing]] programs of the time worked, by placing commands before and after text to indicate how it should appear when printed.\n\nThe term \"flaming\" may originate from ''The Hacker's Dictionary'',<ref>{{cite book |last1=Steele |first1=Guy L |last2=Woods |first2=Donald R |last3=Finkel |first3=Raphael A |last4=Crispin |first4=Mark R |last5=Stallman |first5=Richard M |last6=Goodfellow |first6=Geoffrey S |title=The Hacker's dictionary: a guide to the world of computer wizards |url=https://archive.org/details/hackersdictionar00stee |url-access=registration |date=1983 |publisher=Harper & Row |location=New York}}</ref> which in 1983 defined it as \"to speak rabidly or incessantly on an uninteresting topic or with a patently ridiculous attitude\". The meaning of the word has diverged from this definition since then.\n\n[[Jerry Pournelle]] in 1986 explained why he wanted a [[kill file]] for [[Byte Information Exchange|BIX]]:<ref name=\"pournelle198603\">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1986-03/1986_03_BYTE_11-03_Homebound_Computing#page/n281/mode/2up | title=All Sorts of Software | work=BYTE | date=March 1986 | accessdate=27 August 2015 | author=Pournelle, Jerry | pages=269}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|whereas an open computer conference begins with a small number of well-informed and highly interested participants, it soon attracts others. That's all right; it's supposed to attract others. Where else would you get new ideas? But soon it attracts too many, far too many, and some of them are not only ignorant but aggressively ''mis''informed. Dilution takes place. Arguments replace discussions. Tempers are frayed.\n\nThe result is that while computer conferencing began by saving time, it starts to eat up all the time it saved and more. Communications come from dozens of sources. Much of it is redundant. Some of it is stupid. The user spends more and more time dealing with irrelevancies. One day the user wakes up, decides the initial euphoria was spurious, and logs off, never to return. This is known as burnout, and it's apparently quite common.}}\n\nHe added, \"I noticed something: most of the irritation came from a handful of people, sometimes only one or two. If I could only ignore them, the computer conferences were still valuable. Alas, it's not always easy to do\".<ref name=\"pournelle198603\" />\n\nComputer-mediated communication (CMC) research has spent a significant amount of time and effort describing and predicting engagement in uncivil, aggressive online communication.

Flame wars often draw in many users (including those trying to defuse the flame war) and can overshadow regular forum discussion if left unchecked.\n\nResolving a flame war can be difficult, as it is often hard to determine who is really responsible for the degradation of a reasonable discussion into flame war. Someone who posts a contrary opinion in a strongly focused discussion forum may be easily labeled a \"baiter\", \"flamer\", or \"troll\".\n\nFlame wars can become intense and can include \"death threats, [[ad hominem]] invective, and textual amplifiers\" but to some sociologists flame wars can actually bring people together. What is being said in a flame war should not be taken too seriously since the harsh words are a part of flaming.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Jane|first=Emma A.|date=2015-03-01|title=Flaming?

Acknowledging mistakes, offering to help resolve the disagreement, making clear, reasoned arguments, and even self-deprecation have all been noted as worthwhile strategies to end such disputes. However, others prefer to simply ignore flaming, noting that, in many cases, if the flamebait receives no attention, it will quickly be forgotten as forum discussions carry on.<ref name=\"reid\" /> Unfortunately, this can motivate trolls to intensify their activities, creating additional distractions.\n\n\"Taking the bait\" or \"feeding the troll\" refers to someone who responds to the original message regardless of whether they are aware the original message was intended to provoke a response. Often when someone takes the bait, others will point this out to them with the [[acronym]] \"YHBT\", which is short for \"You have been trolled\", or reply with \"don't feed the trolls\". Forum users will usually not give the troll acknowledgement; that just \"feeds the troll\".\n\nIn sociology, history, or any kind of online ethnographic academic study, flame wars as a corpus, in a [[Science studies|STS]] approach of [[Mapping controversies|controversies]], may be used to understand what is at stake in a community. The idea is that the flame war drives the actors into abandoning a polite stance and forces them to engage into debate and to unveil otherwise concealed arguments. In this respect, the most interesting parts of an online corpus are the flame wars as \"outbursts of heated, short and dense debates, in an ocean of evenly distributed polite messages\".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hocquet|first=Alexandre|last2=Wieber|first2=Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric|date=2018-04-03|title=Mailing list archives as useful primary sources for historians: looking for flame wars|journal=Internet Histories|language=en|volume=2|issue=1\u20132|pages=38\u201354|doi=10.1080/24701475.2018.1456741|issn=2470-1475}}</ref>\n\n=== Political flaming ===\nPolitical flaming typically occur when people have their views challenged and they seek to have their anger known. Through the covering of one's identity people may be more likely to engage in political flaming.<ref name=\":02\"/> In a 2015 study conducted by Hutchens, Cicchirillo, and Hmielowski, they found that \"those who were more experienced with political discussions -either online or offline- were more likely to indicate they would respond with a flame\" and they also found that verbal aggression also played a role in a person engaging in political flaming.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\n=== Corporate flaming ===\nCorporate flaming is when a large number of critical comments, usually aggressive or insulting, are directed at a company's employees, products, or brands. Common causes include inappropriate behavior of company employees, negative customer experiences, inadequate care of customers and influencers, violation of ethical principles, along with apparent injustices and inappropriate reactions. Flame wars can result in  reputational damage, decreased consumer confidence, drops in stock prices and company assets, increased liabilities, increased lawsuits, and a decrease in customers, influencers and sponsors. Based on an assessment of the damage, companies can take years to recover from a flame war that may detract from their core purpose. Kayser notes that companies should prepare for possible flame wars by creating alerts for a predefined \"blacklist\" of words and monitoring fast-growing topics about their company. Alternatively, Kayser, points out that a flame war can lead to a positive experience for the company. Based on the content, it could be shared across multiple platforms and increase company recognition, social media fans/followers, brand presence, purchases, and brand loyalty. Therefore, the type of marketing that results from a flame war can lead to higher profits and brand recognition on a broader scale. Nevertheless, it is encouraged that when a company utilizes social media they should be aware that their content could be used in a flame war and should be treated as an emergency.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Kayser |first1=Holger |last2=Salmann |first2=Stephan |last3=Bartels |first3=Christian |title=Flame war management: handling crises in the social media age |url=https://consulting.ey.com/flame-war-management-handling-crises-in-the-social-media-age/ |website=EY.com |publisher=Ernst & Young |accessdate=4 August 2019 |date=2015-07-30}}</ref>\n\n==Examples==\nAny subject of a polarizing nature can feasibly cause flaming. As one would expect in the medium of the Internet, technology is a common topic. The perennial debates between users of competing operating systems, such as [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[Classic Mac OS]] and [[macOS]], or the [[GNU]]/[[Linux]] operating system and [[iOS]] or [[Android (operating system)|Android]] operating system, users of [[Intel]] and [[AMD]] processors,  and users of the Nintendo Switch, [[Wii U]], [[PlayStation 4]] and [[Xbox One]] video game systems,  often escalate into seemingly unending \"flame wars\", also called [[software wars]]. As each successive technology is released, it develops its own outspoken fan base, allowing arguments to begin anew.\n\nPopular culture continues to generate large amounts of flaming and countless flame wars across the Internet, such as the constant debates between fans of ''[[Star Trek]]'' and ''[[Star Wars]]''. Ongoing discussion of current celebrities and television personalities within popular culture also frequently sparks debate.\n\nIn 2005, author [[Anne Rice]] became involved in a flame war of sorts on the review boards of online retailer [[Amazon.com]] after several reviewers posted scathing comments about her latest novel.  Rice responded to the comments with her own lengthy response, which was quickly met with more feedback from users.<ref name=\"reid\"  />\n\nIn 2007, tech expert [[Kathy Sierra]] was a victim of flaming as an image of her depicted as a mutilated body was spread around online forums. In addition to the doctored photo being spread virally, her social security number and home address were made public as well. Consequently, Sierra effectively gave up her technology career in response to the ensuing harassment and threats that she received as a result of the flaming.<ref name=\"Schwartz\">{{cite web |author=Schwartz, Mattathias |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/03/magazine/03trolls-t.html?pagewanted=all |title=The Trolls Among Us |work=The New York Times Magazine |date=August 3, 2008}}</ref><ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIn November 2007, the popular audio-visual discussion site AVS Forum temporarily closed its [[HD DVD]] and [[Blu-ray]] discussion forums because of, as the site reported, \"physical threats that have involved police and possible legal action\" between [[High definition optical disc format war|advocates of the rival formats]].<ref name=\"moskovciak20071107\">{{cite web | url=http://www.cnet.com/news/format-war-fanboys-shut-down-avs-forum/ | title=Format war fanboys shut down AVS Forum | publisher=CNet | date=2007-11-07 | accessdate=6 July 2014 | author=Moskovciak, Matthew}}</ref>\n\nThe [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 Presidential election]], saw a flame war take place between Republican candidate [[Donald Trump]] and the Democratic candidate [[Hillary Clinton]].

Flame wars can have a lasting impact on some internet communities where even once a flame war has concluded a division or even dissolution may occur.<ref name=\"Ashlee. 20162\" />\n\nThe pleasant commentaries within a chat room or message board can be limited by a \"war of words\" fight or \"flaming\" with the intent to seek out a negative reaction from the reader. Humphreys defines flaming as \u201cthe use of hostile language online, including swearing, insults and otherwise offensive language\u201d.<ref name=\"Ashlee. 20162\" /> Flaming by perpetrators within the online community is commonly received by messaging through text and rarely by face to face or video communication. By basing their conversations on text and not taking full accountability as the \u2018flamer\u2019, they have a reduced self-awareness of others feelings, emotions and reactions based on the comments that they provide within the virtual community. The reader now has the perception that this \u2018flamer\u2019 is difficult, rude and possibly a bully. The flamer may have limited social cues, emotional intelligence to adapt to others reactions and lack of awareness of how they are being perceived. Their personal social norms, may considered disrespectful to the reader that has different social norms, education and experience with what is and is not appropriate within virtual communities.\n\nThe individuals that create an environment of flaming and hostility, lead the readers to disengage with the offender and may potentially leave the message board and chat room. By leaving the flaming situation, the reader has reacted calmly with limited misinterpretations. The continual use of flaming within the online community can create a disruptive and negative experience for those involved and can lead to limited involvement and engagement within the original chat room and program.<ref>https://www.theguardian.com/global/commentisfree/2019/dec/31/childlessness-pot-shots-may-have-worked-with-julia-gillard-but-there-is-rage-over-princess-palaszczuk</ref>\n\n==Purpose==\n[[Social science|Social researchers]] have investigated flaming, coming up with several different theories about the phenomenon.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=P.J.

Furthermore, within a single individual, mental models change with time, even during the flow of a single conversation. The human mind assembles a few relationships to fit the context of a discussion. As debate shifts, so do the mental models. Even when only a single topic is being discussed, each participant in a conversation employs a different mental model to interpret the subject. Fundamental assumptions differ but are never brought into the open. Goals are different but left unstated. It is little wonder that compromise takes so long. And even when consensus is reached, the underlying assumptions may be fallacies that lead to laws and programs that fail. The human mind is not adapted to understanding correctly the consequences implied by a mental model. A mental model may be correct in structure and assumptions but, even so, the human mind\u2014either individually or as a group consensus\u2014is apt to draw the wrong implications for the future.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sysdyn.clexchange.org/sdep/Roadmaps/RM1/D-4468-2.pdf|title=Counterintuitive Behavior of Social Systems|author=Jay W.

Without social context, users are often helpless to know the intentions of their counterparts. In addition to the problems of conflicting mental models often present in online discussions, the inherent lack of face-to-face communication online can encourage hostility. Professor Norman Johnson, commenting on the propensity of Internet posters to flame one another, states:<blockquote>The literature suggests that, compared to face-to-face, the increased incidence of flaming when using [[computer-mediated communication]] is due to reductions in the transfer of social cues, which decrease individuals' concern for social evaluation and fear of social sanctions or reprisals. When social identity and ingroup status are salient, computer mediation can decrease flaming because individuals focus their attention on the social context (and associated norms) rather than themselves.<ref name=\"Johnson2\">{{cite journal|last=Johnson|first=Norman A.|year=2009|title=Anger and flaming in computer-mediated negotiations among strangers|journal=Decision Support Systems|volume=46|issue=3|pages=660\u2013672|doi=10.1016/j.dss.2008.10.008}}</ref></blockquote>A lack of [[social context]] creates an element of anonymity, which allows users to feel insulated from the forms of punishment they might receive in a more conventional setting. Johnson identifies several precursors to flaming between users, whom he refers to as \"negotiation partners,\" since Internet communication typically involves back-and-forth interactions similar to a negotiation. Flaming incidents usually arise in response to a perception of one or more negotiation partners being unfair. Perceived unfairness can include a lack of consideration for an individual's vested interests, unfavorable treatment (especially when the flamer has been considerate of other users), and misunderstandings aggravated by the inability to convey subtle indicators like [[non-verbal]] cues and [[facial expression]]s.<ref name=\"Johnson2\" />\n\n== Factors ==\nThere are multiple factors that play into why people would get involved with flaming. For instance, there is the anonymity factor and that people can use different means to have their identity hidden.<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite journal|last=Hutchens|first=Myiah J|last2=Cicchirillo|first2=Vincent J|last3=Hmielowski|first3=Jay D|date=2014-02-12|title=How could you think that?!?!: Understanding intentions to engage in political flaming|journal=New Media & Society|language=en|volume=17|issue=8|pages=1201\u20131219|doi=10.1177/1461444814522947|issn=1461-4448}}</ref> Through the hiding of one's identity people can build a new persona and act in a way that they normally would not when they have their identity known. Another factor in flaming is proactive aggression \"which is initiated without perceived threat or provocation\" and those who are recipients of flaming may counter with flaming of their own and utilize reactive aggression.<ref name=\":02\"/> Another factor that goes into flaming are the different communication variables. For instance, offline communications networks can impact the way people act online and can lead them to engage in flaming.<ref name=\":02\"/> Finally, there is the factor of verbal aggression and how people who engage in verbal aggression will use those tactics when they engage in flaming online.<ref name=\":02\"/>\n\n[[Randal Munroe]], engineer, scientific theorist, and cartoonist of [[XKCD]], has summarized reasons for the use of flaming and [[flame wars]] succinctly, in \"Duty Calls\" [https://xkcd.com/386/], \"Bad Opinions\" [https://xkcd.com/2051/], and \"Old Timers\" [https://xkcd.com/1058/].\n\nFlaming can range from subtle to extremely aggressive in online behaviors. Derogatory images, certain emojis used in combination, and even the use of capital letters. These things can show a pattern of behavior used to convey certain emotions online. Victims should do their best to avoid fighting back in an attempt to prevent a war of words. Flaming extends past social media interactions. Flaming can also take place through emails, and it may not matter so much whether someone calls an email a \u201cflame,\u201d is based on whether she or he considers an email to be hostile, aggressive, insulting, or offensive. What matters is how the person receives the interaction. So much is lost in translation when communicating online versus in person, that it is hard to distinguish someone's intent.<ref name=\":26\">Anna K.

Arguments over the ratification of the [[United States Constitution]] were often socially and emotionally heated and intense, with many attacking one another through local newspapers. Such interactions have always been part of literary criticism. For example, [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]]'s contempt for [[Jane Austen]]'s works often extended to the author herself, with Emerson describing her as \"without genius, wit, or knowledge of the world\". In turn, [[Thomas Carlyle]] called Emerson a \"hoary-headed toothless baboon\"<ref name=\"reid\">{{cite journal |last1=Goldsborough |first1=Reid |title=How to Respond to Flames (without Getting Singled) |journal=Information Today |date=February 2005 |volume=22 |issue=2}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[modern era]], \"flaming\" was used at East Coast [[engineering]] schools in the United States as a present participle in a crude expression to describe an irascible individual and by extension to such individuals on the earliest [[Internet]] chat rooms and [[message board]]s. Internet flaming was mostly observed in [[Usenet]] newsgroups although it was known to occur in the [[WWIVnet]] and [[FidoNet]] computer networks as well. It was subsequently used in other parts of speech with much the same meaning.\n\nThe term \"flaming\" was seen on [[Usenet]] newsgroups in the eighties, where the start of a flame was sometimes indicated by typing \"FLAME ON\", then \"FLAME OFF\" when the flame section of the post was complete. This is a reference to both The Human Torch of the [[Fantastic Four]], who used those words when activating his flame abilities, and to the way [[text processing]] programs of the time worked, by placing commands before and after text to indicate how it should appear when printed.\n\nThe term \"flaming\" may originate from ''The Hacker's Dictionary'',<ref>{{cite book |last1=Steele |first1=Guy L |last2=Woods |first2=Donald R |last3=Finkel |first3=Raphael A |last4=Crispin |first4=Mark R |last5=Stallman |first5=Richard M |last6=Goodfellow |first6=Geoffrey S |title=The Hacker's dictionary: a guide to the world of computer wizards |url=https://archive.org/details/hackersdictionar00stee |url-access=registration |date=1983 |publisher=Harper & Row |location=New York}}</ref> which in 1983 defined it as \"to speak rabidly or incessantly on an uninteresting topic or with a patently ridiculous attitude\". The meaning of the word has diverged from this definition since then.\n\n[[Jerry Pournelle]] in 1986 explained why he wanted a [[kill file]] for [[Byte Information Exchange|BIX]]:<ref name=\"pournelle198603\">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1986-03/1986_03_BYTE_11-03_Homebound_Computing#page/n281/mode/2up | title=All Sorts of Software | work=BYTE | date=March 1986 | accessdate=27 August 2015 | author=Pournelle, Jerry | pages=269}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|whereas an open computer conference begins with a small number of well-informed and highly interested participants, it soon attracts others. That's all right; it's supposed to attract others. Where else would you get new ideas? But soon it attracts too many, far too many, and some of them are not only ignorant but aggressively ''mis''informed. Dilution takes place. Arguments replace discussions. Tempers are frayed.\n\nThe result is that while computer conferencing began by saving time, it starts to eat up all the time it saved and more. Communications come from dozens of sources. Much of it is redundant. Some of it is stupid. The user spends more and more time dealing with irrelevancies. One day the user wakes up, decides the initial euphoria was spurious, and logs off, never to return. This is known as burnout, and it's apparently quite common.}}\n\nHe added, \"I noticed something: most of the irritation came from a handful of people, sometimes only one or two.

Flame wars often draw in many users (including those trying to defuse the flame war) and can overshadow regular forum discussion if left unchecked.\n\nResolving a flame war can be difficult, as it is often hard to determine who is really responsible for the degradation of a reasonable discussion into flame war. Someone who posts a contrary opinion in a strongly focused discussion forum may be easily labeled a \"baiter\", \"flamer\", or \"troll\".\n\nFlame wars can become intense and can include \"death threats, [[ad hominem]] invective, and textual amplifiers\" but to some sociologists flame wars can actually bring people together. What is being said in a flame war should not be taken too seriously since the harsh words are a part of flaming.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Jane|first=Emma A.|date=2015-03-01|title=Flaming?

Acknowledging mistakes, offering to help resolve the disagreement, making clear, reasoned arguments, and even self-deprecation have all been noted as worthwhile strategies to end such disputes. However, others prefer to simply ignore flaming, noting that, in many cases, if the flamebait receives no attention, it will quickly be forgotten as forum discussions carry on.<ref name=\"reid\" /> Unfortunately, this can motivate trolls to intensify their activities, creating additional distractions.\n\n\"Taking the bait\" or \"feeding the troll\" refers to someone who responds to the original message regardless of whether they are aware the original message was intended to provoke a response. Often when someone takes the bait, others will point this out to them with the [[acronym]] \"YHBT\", which is short for \"You have been trolled\", or reply with \"don't feed the trolls\". Forum users will usually not give the troll acknowledgement; that just \"feeds the troll\".\n\nIn sociology, history, or any kind of online ethnographic academic study, flame wars as a corpus, in a [[Science studies|STS]] approach of [[Mapping controversies|controversies]], may be used to understand what is at stake in a community. The idea is that the flame war drives the actors into abandoning a polite stance and forces them to engage into debate and to unveil otherwise concealed arguments. In this respect, the most interesting parts of an online corpus are the flame wars as \"outbursts of heated, short and dense debates, in an ocean of evenly distributed polite messages\".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hocquet|first=Alexandre|last2=Wieber|first2=Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric|date=2018-04-03|title=Mailing list archives as useful primary sources for historians: looking for flame wars|journal=Internet Histories|language=en|volume=2|issue=1\u20132|pages=38\u201354|doi=10.1080/24701475.2018.1456741|issn=2470-1475}}</ref>\n\n=== Political flaming ===\nPolitical flaming typically occur when people have their views challenged and they seek to have their anger known. Through the covering of one's identity people may be more likely to engage in political flaming.<ref name=\":02\"/> In a 2015 study conducted by Hutchens, Cicchirillo, and Hmielowski, they found that \"those who were more experienced with political discussions -either online or offline- were more likely to indicate they would respond with a flame\" and they also found that verbal aggression also played a role in a person engaging in political flaming.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\n=== Corporate flaming ===\nCorporate flaming is when a large number of critical comments, usually aggressive or insulting, are directed at a company's employees, products, or brands. Common causes include inappropriate behavior of company employees, negative customer experiences, inadequate care of customers and influencers, violation of ethical principles, along with apparent injustices and inappropriate reactions. Flame wars can result in  reputational damage, decreased consumer confidence, drops in stock prices and company assets, increased liabilities, increased lawsuits, and a decrease in customers, influencers and sponsors. Based on an assessment of the damage, companies can take years to recover from a flame war that may detract from their core purpose. Kayser notes that companies should prepare for possible flame wars by creating alerts for a predefined \"blacklist\" of words and monitoring fast-growing topics about their company. Alternatively, Kayser, points out that a flame war can lead to a positive experience for the company. Based on the content, it could be shared across multiple platforms and increase company recognition, social media fans/followers, brand presence, purchases, and brand loyalty. Therefore, the type of marketing that results from a flame war can lead to higher profits and brand recognition on a broader scale. Nevertheless, it is encouraged that when a company utilizes social media they should be aware that their content could be used in a flame war and should be treated as an emergency.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Kayser |first1=Holger |last2=Salmann |first2=Stephan |last3=Bartels |first3=Christian |title=Flame war management: handling crises in the social media age |url=https://consulting.ey.com/flame-war-management-handling-crises-in-the-social-media-age/ |website=EY.com |publisher=Ernst & Young |accessdate=4 August 2019 |date=2015-07-30}}</ref>\n\n==Examples==\nAny subject of a polarizing nature can feasibly cause flaming. As one would expect in the medium of the Internet, technology is a common topic. The perennial debates between users of competing operating systems, such as [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[Classic Mac OS]] and [[macOS]], or the [[GNU]]/[[Linux]] operating system and [[iOS]] or [[Android (operating system)|Android]] operating system, users of [[Intel]] and [[AMD]] processors,  and users of the Nintendo Switch, [[Wii U]], [[PlayStation 4]] and [[Xbox One]] video game systems,  often escalate into seemingly unending \"flame wars\", also called [[software wars]]. As each successive technology is released, it develops its own outspoken fan base, allowing arguments to begin anew.\n\nPopular culture continues to generate large amounts of flaming and countless flame wars across the Internet, such as the constant debates between fans of ''[[Star Trek]]'' and ''[[Star Wars]]''. Ongoing discussion of current celebrities and television personalities within popular culture also frequently sparks debate.\n\nIn 2005, author [[Anne Rice]] became involved in a flame war of sorts on the review boards of online retailer [[Amazon.com]] after several reviewers posted scathing comments about her latest novel.  Rice responded to the comments with her own lengthy response, which was quickly met with more feedback from users.<ref name=\"reid\"  />\n\nIn 2007, tech expert [[Kathy Sierra]] was a victim of flaming as an image of her depicted as a mutilated body was spread around online forums.

Consequently, Sierra effectively gave up her technology career in response to the ensuing harassment and threats that she received as a result of the flaming.<ref name=\"Schwartz\">{{cite web |author=Schwartz, Mattathias |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/03/magazine/03trolls-t.html?pagewanted=all |title=The Trolls Among Us |work=The New York Times Magazine |date=August 3, 2008}}</ref><ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIn November 2007, the popular audio-visual discussion site AVS Forum temporarily closed its [[HD DVD]] and [[Blu-ray]] discussion forums because of, as the site reported, \"physical threats that have involved police and possible legal action\" between [[High definition optical disc format war|advocates of the rival formats]].<ref name=\"moskovciak20071107\">{{cite web | url=http://www.cnet.com/news/format-war-fanboys-shut-down-avs-forum/ | title=Format war fanboys shut down AVS Forum | publisher=CNet | date=2007-11-07 | accessdate=6 July 2014 | author=Moskovciak, Matthew}}</ref>\n\nThe [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 Presidential election]], saw a flame war take place between Republican candidate [[Donald Trump]] and the Democratic candidate [[Hillary Clinton]].

It was the first air operation to strike the Japanese archipelago. It demonstrated that the Japanese mainland was vulnerable to American air attack, served as retaliation for the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], and provided an important boost to American morale. The raid was planned, led by, and named after Lieutenant Colonel [[Jimmy Doolittle|James Doolittle]], later General of the United States Air Force.<ref>{{cite book |title=Official Register of Commissioned Officers of the United States Army |date=1926 |pages=165}}</ref><!--Doolittle did not receive his General Rank until 1985 actually when he was in the Air Force Reserves.

The plan called for them to bomb military targets in Japan and to continue westward to land in China. The bombing raid killed about 50 people, including civilians, and injured 400. Fifteen aircraft reached China but all crashed, while the 16th landed at [[Vladivostok]] in the Soviet Union. Of the 80 crew members, 77 survived the mission. Eight airmen were captured by Japanese Army in China; three were later executed. The B-25 that landed in the Soviet Union was confiscated and its crew interned for more than a year before being allowed to \"escape\" via [[Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran|Soviet-occupied]] [[Imperial State of Iran|Iran]] with the help of the [[NKVD]].

King]] on 10 January 1942 that he thought that twin-engined Army bombers could be launched from an aircraft carrier, after observing several at [[Naval Station Norfolk Chambers Field]] in [[Norfolk, Virginia]], where the runway was painted with the outline of a carrier deck for landing practice.<ref>Glines 1998, p. 13.</ref> \n\nDoolittle, a famous military test pilot, civilian aviator, and aeronautical engineer before the war, was assigned to Army Air Forces Headquarters to plan the raid. The aircraft to be used would need a cruising range of {{convert|2400|nmi|km}} with a {{convert|2000|lb|kg|adj=on}} bomb load, so Doolittle selected the B-25B Mitchell to carry out the mission. The range of the Mitchell was about 1,300 miles, so the bombers had to be modified to hold nearly twice the normal fuel reserves. Doolittle also considered the [[Martin B-26 Marauder]], [[Douglas B-18 Bolo]], and [[Douglas B-23 Dragon]],<ref>Glines 1998, p. 19.</ref> but the B-26 had questionable takeoff characteristics from a carrier deck and the B-23's wingspan was nearly 50-percent greater than the B-25's, reducing the number that could be taken aboard a carrier and posing risks to the ship's superstructure.

The 17th BG had been the first group to receive B-25s, with all four of its squadrons equipped with the bomber by September 1941. The 17th not only was the first medium bomb group of the Army Air Corps, but in early 1942, also had the most experienced B-25 crews. Its first assignment following the entry of the United States into the war was to the U.S. [[Eighth Air Force]].<ref name=\"Craven and Cate 1948, p. 439.\">Craven and Cate 1948, p. 439.</ref>\n\nThe 17th BG, then flying antisubmarine patrols from [[Pendleton, Oregon]], was immediately moved cross-country to [[Columbia Army Air Base]] at [[West Columbia, South Carolina]], ostensibly to fly similar patrols off the east coast of the United States, but in actuality to prepare for the mission against Japan. The group officially transferred effective 9 February 1942 to Columbia, where its combat crews were offered the opportunity to volunteer for an \"extremely hazardous\", but unspecified mission.

With support provided by two senior airline managers, [[Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul International Airport|Wold-Chamberlain Field's]] maintenance hangar was the first modification center to become operational. From nearby [[Fort Snelling]], the 710th Military Police Battalion provided tight security around this hangar. B-25B aircraft modifications included the following:\n* Removal of the lower gun turret.\n* Installation of [[de-ice]]rs and [[Antifreeze|anti-icers]].\n* Mounting of steel blast plates on the fuselage around the upper turret.\n* Removal of the liaison radio set to save weight.\n* Installation of a 160-gallon collapsible neoprene auxiliary fuel tank, fixed to the top of the bomb bay, and installation of support mounts for additional fuel cells in the bomb bay, crawlway, and lower turret area, to increase fuel capacity from 646 to 1,141 [[U.S. gallon]]s (538 to 950 [[Gallon#Imperial gallon|imperial gallons]], or 2,445 to 4,319 L).\n* Installation of mock gun barrels in the tail cone.\n* Replacement of the [[Norden bombsight]] with a makeshift aiming sight devised by pilot Capt.

Dean E. Hallmark (sixth off) and 1st Lt. William G. Farrow (last off). On 15 August 1942, the United States learned from the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[Consul (representative)|Consulate General]] in Shanghai that eight of the missing crew members were prisoners of the Japanese at the city's police headquarters. Two crewmen drowned after crash-landing in the ocean. On 19 October 1942, the Japanese announced that they had tried the eight prisoners and sentenced them all to death, but said several had received commutation of their sentences to life imprisonment. No names or details were given.\n\nThe story of the missing crews was revealed in February 1946 during a [[war crimes]] trial held in Shanghai to try four Japanese officers charged with mistreating the eight captured crewmen. Two of the missing crewmen, bombardier [[staff sergeant|S/Sgt.]] [[William John Dieter|William J. Dieter]] and flight engineer Sgt. Donald E. Fitzmaurice of Hallmark's crew, were found to have drowned when their B-25 crashed into the sea. Both of their remains were recovered after the war and were buried with military honors at [[Golden Gate National Cemetery]].\n\nThe other eight were captured: 1st Lt. Dean E. Hallmark, 1st Lt. William G. Farrow, 1st Lt. Robert J. Meder, 1st Lt. [[Chase Nielsen]], 1st Lt. Robert L. Hite, 2nd Lt. George Barr, Cpl. Harold A. Spatz, and Cpl. [[Jake DeShazer|Jacob DeShazer]]. On 28 August 1942, Hallmark, Farrow, and gunner Spatz faced a war crimes trial by a Japanese court alleging they strafed and murdered Japanese civilians. At 16:30 on 15 October 1942, they were taken by truck to Public Cemetery Number 1 and executed by [[firing squad]].\n\n[[File:Doolittle Raider RL Hite blindfolded by Japanese 1942.jpg|thumb|left|Robert L.

In April 1943, they were moved to [[Nanking]], where Meder died on 1 December 1943. The remaining men\u2014Nielsen, Hite, Barr and DeShazer\u2014eventually began receiving slightly better treatment and were given a copy of the Bible and a few other books. They were freed by American troops in August 1945. Four Japanese officers were tried for war crimes against the captured Doolittle Raiders, found guilty, and sentenced to hard labor, three for five years and one for nine years. Barr had been near death when liberated and remained behind in China recuperating until October, by which time he had begun to experience severe emotional problems. Untreated after transfer to [[Letterman Army Hospital]] and a military hospital in [[Clinton, Iowa]], Barr became suicidal and was held virtually incommunicado until November, when Doolittle's personal intervention resulted in treatment that led to his recovery.<ref>Glines 1988, pp. 202\u201304.</ref> DeShazer graduated from Seattle Pacific University in 1948 and returned to Japan as a [[missionary]], where he served for over 30 years.<ref>DeShazer Dixon, Carol Aiko.

Doolittle was promoted two grades to [[Brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]] on 28 April while still in China, skipping the rank of colonel, and was presented with the [[Medal of Honor]] by Roosevelt upon his return to the United States in June. When General Doolittle toured the growing [[Eglin Field]] facility in July 1942 with commanding officer Col. [[Grandison Gardner]], the local paper of record (the ''Okaloosa News-Journal'', [[Crestview, Florida]]), while reporting his presence, made no mention of his still-secret recent training at Eglin. He went on to command the [[Twelfth Air Force]] in North Africa, the [[Fifteenth Air Force]] in the Mediterranean, and the [[Eighth Air Force]] in England during the next three years.\n\n[[File:111-SC-21321AC (34281999011).jpg|thumb|An injured pilot<!--Who?--> received the Distinguished Flying Cross at Walter Reed Hospital from Maj.

In November 1942, it deployed overseas to North Africa, where it operated in the Mediterranean Theater of Operations with the [[Twelfth Air Force]] for the remainder of the war.\n\n=== Zhejiang-Jiangxi campaign ===\nAfter the raid, the Japanese Imperial Army began the [[Zhejiang-Jiangxi campaign]] (also known as Operation Sei-go) to prevent these eastern coastal provinces of China from being used again for an attack on Japan and to take revenge on the Chinese people.

Chinese estimates put the civilian death toll at 250,000. The Imperial Japanese Army had also spread [[cholera]], [[typhoid]], [[Plague (disease)|plague]] infected fleas and [[dysentery]] pathogens. The Japanese biological warfare [[Unit 731]] brought almost 300 pounds of [[paratyphoid]] and [[anthrax]] to be left in contaminated food and contaminated wells with the withdrawal of the army from areas around Yushan, Kinhwa and Futsin. Around 1,700 Japanese troops died out of a total 10,000 Japanese soldiers who fell ill with disease when their biological weapons attack rebounded on their own forces.<ref name=\":1\">For citations, see the Wikipedia article on the [[Zhejiang-Jiangxi campaign]].</ref>\n\n[[Shunroku Hata]], the commander of Japanese forces involved of the massacre of the 250,000 Chinese civilians, was sentenced 1948 in part due to his \"failure to prevent atrocities\".

The shuttle bombing run was a better carrier task force tactic since there was no need to wait for the returning aircraft.\n\nIf [[Claire Lee Chennault]] had been informed of the mission specifics, the outcome might have been very much better for the Americans. Chennault had built an effective air surveillance net in China that would have been extremely helpful in bringing the planes in for safe landings. The lack of visible beacons in the dark forced them to bail out.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Glines|first1=General James H. \"Jimmy\" Doolittle, with Carroll V.|title=I could never be so lucky again : an autobiography|date=1995|publisher=Schiffer Military/Aviation History|location=Atglen, PA|isbn=0-88740-737-4|pages=7, 10, 267}}</ref>\n\nChinese airfield crews recounted that due to the unexpectedly early arrivals of the B-25s, homing beacon and runway torch lights were not on for fear of possible Japanese airstrikes as happened before.

High command withdrew substantial air force resources from supporting offensive operations in order to defend the home islands; two carriers were diverted to the Alaskan island invasion to prevent them from being used as bomber bases and could not be used in the Midway operations. Thus, the raid's most significant strategic accomplishment was that it compelled the Japanese high command into ordering a very inefficient disposition of their forces, and poor decision-making due to fear of attack, for the rest of the war.\n\n== Effect ==\n[[File:Doolittle Raid Over Tokyo.ogv|thumb|1943 U.S. [[newsreel]] about the raid]]\nCompared with the future devastating [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress]] [[Air raids on Japan|attacks against Japan]], the Doolittle raid did little material damage, and all of it was easily repaired.

[[Mitsuo Fuchida]] and [[Shigeyoshi Miwa]] considered the \"one-way\" raid \"excellent strategy\", with the bombers evading Army fighters by flying \"much lower than anticipated\". Kuroshima said the raid \"passed like a shiver over Japan\" and Miwa criticised the Army for claiming to have shot down nine aircraft rather than \"not even one\".{{sfn|Prange|1982|p=25}}\n\nThe Imperial Japanese Navy also bore a special responsibility for allowing an American aircraft carrier force to approach the Japanese Home Islands in a manner similar to the IJN fleet to Hawaii in 1941, and permitting it to escape undamaged.{{refn|The Japanese, through a small amount of intercepted radio traffic between Halsey and Mitscher, were aware that an American carrier force was at large in the [[Western Pacific Ocean]] and could possibly attack Japan.<ref>Glines 1998, pp. 60\u201362.</ref>}} The fact that medium, normally land-based bombers carried out the attack confused the IJN's high command.

The centerpiece is a like-new B-25, which is painted and marked as Doolittle's aircraft, ''40-2344'', (rebuilt by [[North American Aviation]] to B-25B configuration from an F-10D photo reconnaissance version of the B-25D).

Several authentically dressed mannequins surround the aircraft, including representations of Doolittle, ''Hornet'' Captain [[Marc Mitscher]], and groups of Army and Navy men loading the bomber's bombs and ammunition. Also exhibited are the silver goblets used by the Raiders at each of their annual reunions, pieces of flight clothing and personal equipment, a parachute used by one of the Raiders in his bailout over China, and group photographs of all 16 crews, and other items.\n\n[[File:raiders-goblets-6-15-2013.jpg|left|thumb|Raiders' goblets]]\nThe last B-25 to be retired from the U.S. Air Force inventory is displayed at the [[Air Force Armament Museum]] at Eglin AFB, also in the markings of Gen.

Lawson]] \u2013 a pilot who participated in the raid, focuses on the experiences of himself and his crew. A popular film based on the book was released in 1944. Written while the war was still in progress, Lawson disguised the identities of the persons in China assisting the raiders and did not publish the story until after the USAAF had released an official communique on 20 April 1943 detailing most aspects of the mission, including the identities of the raiders and their fates.\n* ''Doolittle's Tokyo Raiders'', by C. V. Glines (1964) \u2013 tells the complete story of the raid, including the unique experiences of each B-25 crew. He followed this with a second account, ''The Doolittle Raid: America's daring first strike against Japan'' (1988), incorporating information from first-hand accounts of the Raiders and from Japanese sources.<ref>Glines 1988, p. 226.</ref>\n* ''Target Tokyo: Jimmy Doolittle and the Raid That Avenged Pearl Harbor'', by James M. Scott (2015) \u2013 based on scores of never-before-published records drawn from archives across four continents as well as new interviews with survivors.\n\n=== Films ===\nThe raid inspired several films. The 1943 [[RKO]] film ''[[Bombardier (film)|Bombardier]]'' starred [[Randolph Scott]] and [[Pat O'Brien (actor)|Pat O'Brien]]. The climax of this movie is an attack on Japan by a group of B-17s.\n\nA highly fictionalized film in 1943, ''[[Destination Tokyo]]'' starring [[Cary Grant]], tangentially involved the raid, concentrating on the fictional submarine {{USS|Copperfin}}. The submarine's mission is to enter [[Tokyo Bay]] undetected and place a landing party ashore to obtain weather information vital to the upcoming Doolittle raid. The film suggests the raid did not launch until up-to-the-minute data were received. All the after-action reports indicated the raid launched without time for weather briefings because of the encounter with the picket ship.<ref name=\"doo\" />\n\nA 1944 film, ''[[The Purple Heart]]'' was a highly fictionalized account of the torture and execution of Doolittle Raid prisoners.\n\nThe Doolittle Raid was the subject of another 1944 feature film, ''[[Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo]]'', based on the book of the same title by Ted Lawson, who was seriously injured in a crash landing off the coast of China. [[Spencer Tracy]] played Doolittle and [[Van Johnson]] portrayed Lawson. Footage from the film was later used for the opening scenes of ''[[Midway (1976 film)|Midway]]'' and in the TV miniseries ''[[War and Remembrance]]''.\n\nThe 2001 film ''[[Pearl Harbor (film)|Pearl Harbor]]'' (with [[Alec Baldwin]] playing Doolittle) presented a heavily fictionalized version of the raid. The film used the retired World War II aircraft carrier {{USS|Lexington|CV-16|6}} in [[Corpus Christi, Texas]], to stand in for a Japanese carrier, while the aircraft were launched from {{USS|Constellation|CV-64|6}}, standing in for ''Hornet'' from which the Doolittle Raid was launched. The film's portrayal of the planning of the raid, the air raid itself, and the raid's aftermath, is not historically accurate.<ref>Gutthman, Edward.

The video is based on ''The Amazing Story of Sergeant Jacob De Shazer: The Doolittle Raider Who Turned Missionary'' by C. Hoyt Watson. At the end of both the video and the book, DeShazer after the war meets [[Mitsuo Fuchida]], the commander and lead pilot of the Pearl Harbor attack.\n\n''Doolittle's Raiders: A Final Toast'', a documentary by Tim Gray and the World War II Foundation, released in 2015, has interviews with the few surviving members of the raid.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwiifoundation.org/2015/05/02/doolittles-raiders-a-final-toast-documentary-to-premiere-at-the-gi-film-festival-in-washington-dc/|title=Doolittle's Raiders: A Final Toast Documentary to Premiere at the Capitol in Washington, DC|publisher=WWII Foundation |date=6 November 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe 2017 film \"[[The Chinese Widow]]\" aka \"The Hidden Soldier\" presented a heavily fictionalised version of the raid with [[Emile Hirsch]] playing a fictional Captain Jack Turner who was hidden from the Japanese in China by a Chinese widow and her daughter, after he parachutes from his B-25 near her village. [[Vincent Riotta]] played Jimmy Doolittle.\n\nThe raid is depicted in the 2019 film ''[[Midway (2019 film)|Midway]]'', with actor [[Aaron Eckhart]] portraying Jimmy Doolittle.

It was the first air operation to strike the Japanese archipelago. It demonstrated that the Japanese mainland was vulnerable to American air attack, served as retaliation for the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], and provided an important boost to American morale. The raid was planned, led by, and named after Lieutenant Colonel [[Jimmy Doolittle|James Doolittle]], later General of the United States Air Force.<ref>{{cite book |title=Official Register of Commissioned Officers of the United States Army |date=1926 |pages=165}}</ref><!--Doolittle did not receive his General Rank until 1985 actually when he was in the Air Force Reserves.

The plan called for them to bomb military targets in Japan and to continue westward to land in China. The bombing raid killed about 50 people, including civilians, and injured 400. Fifteen aircraft reached China but all crashed, while the 16th landed at [[Vladivostok]] in the Soviet Union. Of the 80 crew members, 77 survived the mission. Eight airmen were captured by Japanese Army in China; three were later executed. The B-25 that landed in the Soviet Union was confiscated and its crew interned for more than a year before being allowed to \"escape\" via [[Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran|Soviet-occupied]] [[Imperial State of Iran|Iran]] with the help of the [[NKVD]]. Fourteen complete crews of five returned to the United States or to American forces, except for one crewman who was killed in action.<ref name=\"bravemen\" /><ref name=\"Glines 1998, pp. 166\u2013168\">Glines 1998, pp. 166\u201368.</ref>\n\nThe raid caused negligible material damage to Japan, but it had major psychological effects. In the United States, it raised morale. In Japan, it raised doubt about the ability of military leaders to defend the home islands, but the bombing and strafing of civilians also steeled Japanese resolve to gain retribution, and this was exploited for propaganda purposes.<ref name=\"hist reex\">{{Cite web | url=http://www.historynet.com/aftermath-doolittle-raid-reexamined.htm |title = Aftermath: How the Doolittle Raid Shook Japan|date = 27 July 2015}}</ref> It also pushed forward Admiral [[Isoroku Yamamoto]]'s plans to attack [[Midway Atoll|Midway Island]] in the Central Pacific, an attack that turned into a decisive defeat of the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) by the U.S. Navy in the [[Battle of Midway]].

King]] on 10 January 1942 that he thought that twin-engined Army bombers could be launched from an aircraft carrier, after observing several at [[Naval Station Norfolk Chambers Field]] in [[Norfolk, Virginia]], where the runway was painted with the outline of a carrier deck for landing practice.<ref>Glines 1998, p. 13.</ref> \n\nDoolittle, a famous military test pilot, civilian aviator, and aeronautical engineer before the war, was assigned to Army Air Forces Headquarters to plan the raid. The aircraft to be used would need a cruising range of {{convert|2400|nmi|km}} with a {{convert|2000|lb|kg|adj=on}} bomb load, so Doolittle selected the B-25B Mitchell to carry out the mission. The range of the Mitchell was about 1,300 miles, so the bombers had to be modified to hold nearly twice the normal fuel reserves. Doolittle also considered the [[Martin B-26 Marauder]], [[Douglas B-18 Bolo]], and [[Douglas B-23 Dragon]],<ref>Glines 1998, p. 19.</ref> but the B-26 had questionable takeoff characteristics from a carrier deck and the B-23's wingspan was nearly 50-percent greater than the B-25's, reducing the number that could be taken aboard a carrier and posing risks to the ship's superstructure. The B-18 was one of the final two types that Doolittle considered, and he rejected it for the same reason.<ref>Glines 1998, pp. 19\u201320.</ref> The B-25 had yet to see combat,{{refn|The first bombing mission by B-25s preceded the Doolittle Raid by only 12 days. On 6 April 1942, six Mitchells bombed [[Gasmata]], [[New Britain]]. This was followed on 12 and 13 April by two days of attacks against [[Cebu City]] and [[Davao City|Davao]] in the Philippines.

The 17th BG had been the first group to receive B-25s, with all four of its squadrons equipped with the bomber by September 1941. The 17th not only was the first medium bomb group of the Army Air Corps, but in early 1942, also had the most experienced B-25 crews. Its first assignment following the entry of the United States into the war was to the U.S. [[Eighth Air Force]].<ref name=\"Craven and Cate 1948, p. 439.\">Craven and Cate 1948, p. 439.</ref>\n\nThe 17th BG, then flying antisubmarine patrols from [[Pendleton, Oregon]], was immediately moved cross-country to [[Columbia Army Air Base]] at [[West Columbia, South Carolina]], ostensibly to fly similar patrols off the east coast of the United States, but in actuality to prepare for the mission against Japan. The group officially transferred effective 9 February 1942 to Columbia, where its combat crews were offered the opportunity to volunteer for an \"extremely hazardous\", but unspecified mission.

With support provided by two senior airline managers, [[Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul International Airport|Wold-Chamberlain Field's]] maintenance hangar was the first modification center to become operational. From nearby [[Fort Snelling]], the 710th Military Police Battalion provided tight security around this hangar. B-25B aircraft modifications included the following:\n* Removal of the lower gun turret.\n* Installation of [[de-ice]]rs and [[Antifreeze|anti-icers]].\n* Mounting of steel blast plates on the fuselage around the upper turret.\n* Removal of the liaison radio set to save weight.\n* Installation of a 160-gallon collapsible neoprene auxiliary fuel tank, fixed to the top of the bomb bay, and installation of support mounts for additional fuel cells in the bomb bay, crawlway, and lower turret area, to increase fuel capacity from 646 to 1,141 [[U.S. gallon]]s (538 to 950 [[Gallon#Imperial gallon|imperial gallons]], or 2,445 to 4,319 L).\n* Installation of mock gun barrels in the tail cone.\n* Replacement of the [[Norden bombsight]] with a makeshift aiming sight devised by pilot Capt.

[[Lieutenant (navy)|Lieutenant]] Henry L.

Dean E. Hallmark (sixth off) and 1st Lt. William G. Farrow (last off). On 15 August 1942, the United States learned from the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[Consul (representative)|Consulate General]] in Shanghai that eight of the missing crew members were prisoners of the Japanese at the city's police headquarters. Two crewmen drowned after crash-landing in the ocean. On 19 October 1942, the Japanese announced that they had tried the eight prisoners and sentenced them all to death, but said several had received commutation of their sentences to life imprisonment. No names or details were given.\n\nThe story of the missing crews was revealed in February 1946 during a [[war crimes]] trial held in Shanghai to try four Japanese officers charged with mistreating the eight captured crewmen. Two of the missing crewmen, bombardier [[staff sergeant|S/Sgt.]] [[William John Dieter|William J. Dieter]] and flight engineer Sgt. Donald E. Fitzmaurice of Hallmark's crew, were found to have drowned when their B-25 crashed into the sea. Both of their remains were recovered after the war and were buried with military honors at [[Golden Gate National Cemetery]].\n\nThe other eight were captured: 1st Lt. Dean E. Hallmark, 1st Lt.

On 28 August 1942, Hallmark, Farrow, and gunner Spatz faced a war crimes trial by a Japanese court alleging they strafed and murdered Japanese civilians. At 16:30 on 15 October 1942, they were taken by truck to Public Cemetery Number 1 and executed by [[firing squad]].\n\n[[File:Doolittle Raider RL Hite blindfolded by Japanese 1942.jpg|thumb|left|Robert L.

The remaining men\u2014Nielsen, Hite, Barr and DeShazer\u2014eventually began receiving slightly better treatment and were given a copy of the Bible and a few other books. They were freed by American troops in August 1945. Four Japanese officers were tried for war crimes against the captured Doolittle Raiders, found guilty, and sentenced to hard labor, three for five years and one for nine years. Barr had been near death when liberated and remained behind in China recuperating until October, by which time he had begun to experience severe emotional problems. Untreated after transfer to [[Letterman Army Hospital]] and a military hospital in [[Clinton, Iowa]], Barr became suicidal and was held virtually incommunicado until November, when Doolittle's personal intervention resulted in treatment that led to his recovery.<ref>Glines 1988, pp. 202\u201304.</ref> DeShazer graduated from Seattle Pacific University in 1948 and returned to Japan as a [[missionary]], where he served for over 30 years.<ref>DeShazer Dixon, Carol Aiko.

Doolittle was promoted two grades to [[Brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]] on 28 April while still in China, skipping the rank of colonel, and was presented with the [[Medal of Honor]] by Roosevelt upon his return to the United States in June. When General Doolittle toured the growing [[Eglin Field]] facility in July 1942 with commanding officer Col. [[Grandison Gardner]], the local paper of record (the ''Okaloosa News-Journal'', [[Crestview, Florida]]), while reporting his presence, made no mention of his still-secret recent training at Eglin.

Chinese estimates put the civilian death toll at 250,000. The Imperial Japanese Army had also spread [[cholera]], [[typhoid]], [[Plague (disease)|plague]] infected fleas and [[dysentery]] pathogens. The Japanese biological warfare [[Unit 731]] brought almost 300 pounds of [[paratyphoid]] and [[anthrax]] to be left in contaminated food and contaminated wells with the withdrawal of the army from areas around Yushan, Kinhwa and Futsin. Around 1,700 Japanese troops died out of a total 10,000 Japanese soldiers who fell ill with disease when their biological weapons attack rebounded on their own forces.<ref name=\":1\">For citations, see the Wikipedia article on the [[Zhejiang-Jiangxi campaign]].</ref>\n\n[[Shunroku Hata]], the commander of Japanese forces involved of the massacre of the 250,000 Chinese civilians, was sentenced 1948 in part due to his \"failure to prevent atrocities\".

The shuttle bombing run was a better carrier task force tactic since there was no need to wait for the returning aircraft.\n\nIf [[Claire Lee Chennault]] had been informed of the mission specifics, the outcome might have been very much better for the Americans. Chennault had built an effective air surveillance net in China that would have been extremely helpful in bringing the planes in for safe landings.

High command withdrew substantial air force resources from supporting offensive operations in order to defend the home islands; two carriers were diverted to the Alaskan island invasion to prevent them from being used as bomber bases and could not be used in the Midway operations. Thus, the raid's most significant strategic accomplishment was that it compelled the Japanese high command into ordering a very inefficient disposition of their forces, and poor decision-making due to fear of attack, for the rest of the war.\n\n== Effect ==\n[[File:Doolittle Raid Over Tokyo.ogv|thumb|1943 U.S. [[newsreel]] about the raid]]\nCompared with the future devastating [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress]] [[Air raids on Japan|attacks against Japan]], the Doolittle raid did little material damage, and all of it was easily repaired.

The centerpiece is a like-new B-25, which is painted and marked as Doolittle's aircraft, ''40-2344'', (rebuilt by [[North American Aviation]] to B-25B configuration from an F-10D photo reconnaissance version of the B-25D). The bomber, which North American Aviation presented to the Raiders in 1958, rests on a reproduction of ''Hornet''{{'}}s flight deck. Several authentically dressed mannequins surround the aircraft, including representations of Doolittle, ''Hornet'' Captain [[Marc Mitscher]], and groups of Army and Navy men loading the bomber's bombs and ammunition. Also exhibited are the silver goblets used by the Raiders at each of their annual reunions, pieces of flight clothing and personal equipment, a parachute used by one of the Raiders in his bailout over China, and group photographs of all 16 crews, and other items.\n\n[[File:raiders-goblets-6-15-2013.jpg|left|thumb|Raiders' goblets]]\nThe last B-25 to be retired from the U.S. Air Force inventory is displayed at the [[Air Force Armament Museum]] at Eglin AFB, also in the markings of Gen.

Lawson]] \u2013 a pilot who participated in the raid, focuses on the experiences of himself and his crew. A popular film based on the book was released in 1944. Written while the war was still in progress, Lawson disguised the identities of the persons in China assisting the raiders and did not publish the story until after the JuSAAF had released an official communique on 20 April 1943 detailing most aspects of the mission, including the identities of the raiders and their fates.\n* ''Doolittle's Tokyo Raiders'', by C. V. Glines (1964) \u2013 tells the complete story of the raid, including the unique experiences of each B-25 crew. A quarter century later he followed up with a second account, ''The Doolittle Raid: America's daring first strike against Japan'' (1988), incorporating information from first-hand accounts of the Raiders and from Japanese sources.<ref>Glines 1988, p. 226.</ref>\n* ''Target Tokyo: Jimmy Doolittle and the Raid That Avenged Pearl Harbor'', by James M. Scott (2015) \u2013 based on scores of never-before-published records drawn from archives across four continents as well as new interviews with survivors.\n\n=== Films ===\nThe raid inspired several films. The 1943 [[RKO]] film ''[[Bombardier (film)|Bombardier]]'' starred [[Randolph Scott]] and [[Pat O'Brien (actor)|Pat O'Brien]]. The climax of this movie is an attack on Japan by a group of B-17s.\n\nA highly fictionalized film in 1943, ''[[Destination Tokyo]]'' starring [[Cary Grant]], tangentially involved the raid, concentrating on the fictional submarine {{USS|Copperfin}}. The submarine's mission is to enter [[Tokyo Bay]] undetected and place a landing party ashore to obtain weather information vital to the upcoming Doolittle raid. The film suggests the raid did not launch until up-to-the-minute data were received. All the after-action reports indicated the raid launched without time for weather briefings because of the encounter with the picket ship.<ref name=\"doo\" />\n\nA 1944 film, ''[[The Purple Heart]]'' was a highly fictionalized account of the torture and execution of Doolittle Raid prisoners.\n\nThe Doolittle Raid was the subject of another 1944 feature film, ''[[Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo]]'', based on the book of the same title by Ted Lawson, who was seriously injured in a crash landing off the coast of China. [[Spencer Tracy]] played Doolittle and [[Van Johnson]] portrayed Lawson. Footage from the film was later used for the opening scenes of ''[[Midway (1976 film)|Midway]]'' and in the TV miniseries ''[[War and Remembrance]]''.\n\nThe 2001 film ''[[Pearl Harbor (film)|Pearl Harbor]]'' (with [[Alec Baldwin]] playing Doolittle) presented a heavily fictionalized version of the raid. The film used the retired World War II aircraft carrier {{USS|Lexington|CV-16|6}} in [[Corpus Christi, Texas]], to stand in for a Japanese carrier, while the aircraft were launched from {{USS|Constellation|CV-64|6}}, standing in for ''Hornet'' from which the Doolittle Raid was launched. The film's portrayal of the planning of the raid, the air raid itself, and the raid's aftermath, is not historically accurate.<ref>Gutthman, Edward.

The video is based on ''The Amazing Story of Sergeant Jacob De Shazer: The Doolittle Raider Who Turned Missionary'' by C. Hoyt Watson. At the end of both the video and the book, DeShazer after the war meets [[Mitsuo Fuchida]], the commander and lead pilot of the Pearl Harbor attack.\n\n''Doolittle's Raiders: A Final Toast'', a documentary by Tim Gray and the World War II Foundation, released in 2015, has interviews with the few surviving members of the raid.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwiifoundation.org/2015/05/02/doolittles-raiders-a-final-toast-documentary-to-premiere-at-the-gi-film-festival-in-washington-dc/|title=Doolittle's Raiders: A Final Toast Documentary to Premiere at the Capitol in Washington, DC|publisher=WWII Foundation |date=6 November 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe 2017 film \"[[The Chinese Widow]]\" aka \"The Hidden Soldier\" presented a heavily fictionalised version of the raid with [[Emile Hirsch]] playing a fictional Captain Jack Turner who was hidden from the Japanese in China by a Chinese widow and her daughter, after he parachutes from his B-25 near her village. [[Vincent Riotta]] played Jimmy Doolittle.\n\nThe raid is depicted in the 2019 film ''[[Midway (2019 film)|Midway]]'', with actor [[Aaron Eckhart]] portraying Jimmy Doolittle.

It is shot in the style of [[Found footage (pseudo-documentary)|found footage]].\n\n== Plot ==\nFive [[Oregon]] college students set off to find out what happened to the nine hikers who mysteriously died in the [[Dyatlov Pass incident]]. Holly and Jensen are co-directors, J.P. and Andy are expert climbers, and Denise is the sound engineer. After the film introduces the characters, Russian-language news discusses the students' disappearance. The Russian government recovers video footage but refuses to release it to the public; however hackers obtain and release the footage, which forms the rest of the film.\n\nIn Russia, the students first try to contact a member of the initial 1959 expedition who turned back after becoming ill on the first day. However, the man has been hospitalised following a nervous breakdown. The administrators at the hospital claim that he is dead and attempt to turn away the filmmakers. In an upstairs window, the students see a man they assume to be the survivor; he holds up a sign in Russian and is dragged away by orderlies. At a bar, the students recruit Sergei, who translates the sign as a warning to turn back. Undeterred, Sergei introduces them to his aunt, Alya, who was part of the first rescue team. She tells them that a strange machine and eleven bodies were found at the site, not nine, as is commonly reported. The final two bodies had something wrong with them. \n\nAt their camp site, Holly hears howling. The next morning, the group notices barefoot prints in the snow that start and stop suddenly. Jensen claims the footprints are from [[yeti]], but the others claim that Holly is messing with them. After hiking further, they again hear howling and find footprints that lead to a weather tower. Inside the weather tower, they find a human tongue. Denise wants to leave, but the others convince her to continue. Jensen reveals that as a teenager he had heard the howling during a bad acid trip that ended with him being arrested while yelling incoherently about demons. Holly attempts to comfort Jensen by relating that she has had recurring dreams about Dyatlov Pass, which she interprets as fate. Unnoticed by the group two mysterious creatures move through the snow in the distance.\n\nThe group arrives at Dyatlov Pass unsettlingly ahead of schedule. J.P. and Andy are further spooked when their navigational equipment exhibits strange malfunctions. Using a Geiger counter, Holly and Jensen are led to a bunker that locks from the outside. The door is already unlocked but frozen shut; they manage to open the door. They return to the camp without telling anyone about the bunker. The next morning, the group is awakened by explosions that cause an avalanche. Denise is killed, and Andy suffers a bad fracture. After they fire a flare, Russian soldiers posing as a rescue party arrive, kill Andy, and chase the three survivors to the bunker. J.P. is shot and wounded as they enter. Moving into a tunnel system a mysterious creature moves through one tunnel while the three enter another. Holly and Jensen leave the wounded J.P. as they explore the bunker. Inside, they discover evidence of teleportation experiments, a dead soldier who is missing his tongue, a camcorder identical to theirs that has footage of their present conversation, dead bodies stacked in a pile, and files relating to the [[Philadelphia Experiment]].\n\nJensen and Holly hear J.P. screaming, and find him under attack by mutants who seem to be able to teleport. The mutants kill J.P. and chase Jensen and Holly into a sealed room with a strange looking tunnel that leads further into a natural cave. Jensen theorises this is a [[wormhole]]. Unwilling to starve to death or face the mutants, Jensen and Holly choose to step into the wormhole. Since there are no controls, Jensen suggests that they visualise a nearby destination. Holly suggests the bunker entrance, and they enter the wormhole.  \n\nIn 1959, Russian military personnel discover two bodies near the bunker's entrance. Soldiers chase away a younger version of Sergei's aunt Alya, who had just stumbled across the bodies. They recover their video camera. They drag the bodies inside the bunker, which is fully operational and manned. The commanding officer orders the bodies to be stripped and hung on meat hooks. As the soldiers leave, the mutated bodies of Jensen and Holly, identified by Holly's neck tattoo, begin to revive.\n\n== Cast ==\n* Holly Goss as Holly King, co-director\n* [[Matt Stokoe]] as Jensen Day, co-director and conspiracy theorist\n* Luke Albright as J. P. Hauser, Jr., expert climber\n* [[Ryan Hawley]] as Andy Thatcher, expert climber\n* [[Gemma Atkinson]] as Denise Evers, audio engineer\n* [[Richard Reid (actor)|Richard Reid]] as Sgt. Smirnov, the Russian soldier\n* Nikolay Butenin as Sergei\n* Nelly Nielsen as Alya, age 73\n** Valeriya Fedorovich as Alya, age 20\n\n== Production ==\nDirector Renny Harlin spent time in Moscow researching the government archives.  His own theory of what happened at the [[Dyatlov Pass incident]] is that a government experiment went wrong.  The casting for the film was intentionally kept to unknowns.  Shooting took place in northern Russia.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://dreadcentral.com/news/47530/exclusive-filmmaker-renny-harlin-takes-us-through-devils-pass-and-more|title=Exclusive: Filmmaker Renny Harlin Takes Us Through Devil's Pass and More|last=Wixson|first=Heather|work=[[Dread Central]]|date=27 August 2013|accessdate=20 December 2013}}</ref>\n\n== Release ==\n''Devil's Pass'' was released 23 August 2013.<ref name=release/> It was released on DVD in the UK 26 August 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://dreadcentral.com/news/69824/uk-readers-win-dyatlov-pass-incident-dvd|title=CONTEST CLOSED!

It is shot in the style of [[Found footage (pseudo-documentary)|found footage]].\n\n== Plot ==\nFive [[Oregon]] college students set off to find out what happened to the nine hikers who mysteriously died in the [[Dyatlov Pass incident]]. Holly and Jensen are co-directors, J.P. and Andy are expert climbers, and Denise is the sound engineer. After the film introduces the characters, Russian-language news discusses the students' disappearance. The Russian government recovers video footage but refuses to release it to the public; however hackers obtain and release the footage, which forms the rest of the film.\n\nIn Russia, the students first try to contact a member of the initial 1959 expedition who turned back after becoming ill on the first day. However, the man has been hospitalised following a nervous breakdown. The administrators at the hospital claim that he is dead and attempt to turn away the filmmakers. In an upstairs window, the students see a man they assume to be the survivor; he holds up a sign in Russian and is dragged away by orderlies. At a bar, the students recruit Sergei, who translates the sign as a warning to turn back. Undeterred, Sergei introduces them to his aunt, Alya, who was part of the first rescue team. She tells them that a strange machine and eleven bodies were found at the site, not nine, as is commonly reported. The final two bodies had something wrong with them. \n\nAt their camp site, Holly hears howling. The next morning, the group notices barefoot prints in the snow that start and stop suddenly. Jensen claims the footprints are from [[yeti]], but the others claim that Holly is messing with them. After hiking further, they again hear howling and find footprints that lead to a weather tower. Inside the weather tower, they find a human tongue. Denise wants to leave, but the others convince her to continue. Jensen reveals that as a teenager he had heard the howling during a bad acid trip that ended with him being arrested while yelling incoherently about demons. Holly attempts to comfort Jensen by relating that she has had recurring dreams about Dyatlov Pass, which she interprets as fate. Unnoticed by the group two mysterious creatures move through the snow in the distance.\n\nThe group arrives at Dyatlov Pass unsettlingly ahead of schedule. J.P. and Andy are further spooked when their navigational equipment exhibits strange malfunctions. Using a Geiger counter, Holly and Jensen are led to a bunker that locks from the outside. The door is already unlocked but frozen shut; they manage to open the door. They return to the camp without telling anyone about the bunker. The next morning, the group is awakened by explosions that cause an avalanche. Denise is killed, and Andy suffers a bad fracture. After they fire a flare, Russian soldiers posing as a rescue party arrive, kill Andy, and chase the three survivors to the bunker. J.P. is shot and wounded as they enter. Moving into a tunnel system a mysterious creature moves through one tunnel while the three enter another. Holly and Jensen leave the wounded J.P. as they explore the bunker. Inside, they discover evidence of teleportation experiments, a dead soldier who is missing his tongue, a camcorder identical to theirs that has footage of their present conversation, dead bodies stacked in a pile, and files relating to the [[Philadelphia Experiment]].\n\nJensen and Holly hear J.P. screaming, and find him under attack by mutants who seem to be able to teleport. The mutants kill J.P. and chase Jensen and Holly into a sealed room with a strange looking tunnel that leads further into a natural cave. Jensen theorises this is a [[wormhole]]. Unwilling to starve to death or face the mutants, Jensen and Holly choose to step into the wormhole. Since there are no controls, Jensen suggests that they visualise a nearby destination. Holly suggests the bunker entrance, and they enter the wormhole.  \n\nIn 1959, Russian military personnel discover two bodies near the bunker's entrance. Soldiers chase away a younger version of Sergei's aunt Alya, who had just stumbled across the bodies. They recover their video camera. They drag the bodies inside the bunker, which is fully operational and manned. The commanding officer orders the bodies to be stripped and hung on meat hooks. As the soldiers leave, the mutated bodies of Jensen and Holly, identified by Holly's neck tattoo, begin to revive.\n\n== Cast ==\n* Holly Goss as Holly King, co-director\n* [[Matt Stokoe]] as Jensen Day, co-director and conspiracy theorist\n* Luke Albright as J. P. Hauser, Jr., expert climber\n* [[Ryan Hawley]] as Andy Thatcher, expert climber\n* [[Gemma Atkinson]] as Denise Evers, audio engineer\n* [[Richard Reid (actor)|Richard Reid]] as Sgt.

His own theory of what happened at the [[Dyatlov Pass incident]] is that a government experiment went wrong.  The casting for the film was intentionally kept to unknowns.  Shooting took place in northern Russia.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://dreadcentral.com/news/47530/exclusive-filmmaker-renny-harlin-takes-us-through-devils-pass-and-more|title=Exclusive: Filmmaker Renny Harlin Takes Us Through Devil's Pass and More|last=Wixson|first=Heather|work=[[Dread Central]]|date=27 August 2013|accessdate=20 December 2013}}</ref>\n\n== Release ==\n''Devil's Pass'' was released 23 August 2013.<ref name=release/> It was released on DVD in the UK 26 August 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://dreadcentral.com/news/69824/uk-readers-win-dyatlov-pass-incident-dvd|title=CONTEST CLOSED!

In the process of dynamiting the [[lode]], he falls and breaks his leg. He saves a silver sample, climbs out of the mine and drags himself to an assay office, where he receives a silver and gold certificate [[land claim|claim]]. In 1902, [[history of oil in California through 1930|he discovers oil near Los Angeles]] and establishes a drilling company. Following the death of a worker in an accident, Daniel adopts the man's orphaned son. The boy, H. W., becomes his nominal business partner, allowing Daniel to present himself to potential investors as a family man.\n\nIn 1911, Daniel is approached by Paul Sunday, a young man who tells him of an oil deposit under his family's property in Little Boston, California. Daniel attempts to purchase the farm from the Sundays at a bargain price, but he is blocked by Eli, Paul's twin brother and a local evangelical preacher. In exchange for the rights to the property, Eli demands $10,000 \"for his church.\" An agreement is made and Daniel acquires all the available land in and around the Sunday property, save for one holdout: William Bandy.\n\nOil drilling commences, but soon a series of misfortunes occur: an accident kills one worker and a [[blowout (well drilling)|gas blowout]] deafens H. W. Eli blames the disasters on the well not being properly blessed. When Eli publicly demands the money still owed to him, Daniel beats and humiliates him. At the dinner table that night, Eli attacks and berates his father for trusting Daniel.\n\nA man arrives at Daniel's doorstep claiming to be his half-brother, Henry. Daniel hires Henry and the two grow close. A jealous H. W. sets fire to their house, intending to kill Henry. A furious Daniel sends H. W. away to a school for the deaf in [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]]. A representative from [[Standard Oil]] offers to buy out Daniel's local interests, but after a perceived slight, Daniel refuses and strikes a deal with [[Union Oil]] to build a pipeline to the California coast. However, Bandy's ranch remains an impediment.\n\nReminiscing about his childhood, Daniel becomes suspicious to the truth of Henry's story and confronts him one night at gunpoint. \"Henry\" confesses that he was a friend of the real Henry, who died of [[tuberculosis]], and that he impersonated Henry in hopes of gaining employment with Daniel. In a fit of rage, Daniel murders the impostor and buries his body.\n\nThe next morning, Daniel is awakened by Bandy, who knows of Daniel's crime and wants Daniel to publicly repent in Eli's church in exchange for the pipeline construction rights on his land. As part of his [[baptism]], Eli humiliates Daniel and coerces him into confessing that he abandoned his son. Some time later, as the pipeline is under construction, H. W. is reunited with Daniel and Eli leaves Little Boston for missionary work.\n\nIn 1927, H. W. marries Mary Sunday, the younger sister of Paul and Eli. He visits Daniel, who is now an extremely wealthy but [[alcoholism|alcoholic]] recluse in a large mansion. Through a [[language interpretation|sign language interpreter]], H. W. asks his father to dissolve their partnership so that he can establish his own independent drilling company in [[Mexico]]. Daniel reacts brutally, mocking H. W.'s deafness before revealing his true origins as an orphan \"bastard from a basket.\" H. W. tells Daniel he is glad that they are not related and storms out.\n\nEli visits Daniel, who is drunk in his private [[bowling alley]]. Eli, now a radio preacher, offers to sell Daniel the property rights to the Bandy ranch, as William Bandy has recently died. Daniel agrees on the condition that Eli denounce his faith and his own credibility. Eli reluctantly acquiesces, only for Daniel to then reveal that the property is now worthless because he has already drained its oil by [[slant drilling]] from neighboring wells. Shaken, Eli confesses to being in dire financial straits and to having strayed morally. Daniel taunts Eli in revenge for his own previous humiliation before chasing him around the bowling alley and eventually beats him to death with a bowling pin. Exhausted, Daniel collapses on the floor next to Eli's body and announces that he is \"finished.\"\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Daniel Day-Lewis]] as Daniel Plainview\n* [[Paul Dano]] as Paul Sunday and Eli Sunday\n* [[Kevin J.

Although he had read Sinclair's ''[[The Jungle]]'', he did not know about his other works or anything about Sinclair himself. He decided to read most of Sinclair's works, and eventually read the novel ''[[Oil!]]'', which he loved. Schlosser, who found the book to be exciting and thought it would make a great film, sought out the Sinclair estate and purchased the film rights. He thought that he would try to find a director who was as passionate about the book as he was, but director Paul Thomas Anderson approached him first.<ref name=\"ES-TNYT-2008\">{{cite news |author=Schlosser, Eric  |date=February 22, 2008 |title='Oil!' and the History of Southern California |newspaper=The New York Times}}</ref>\n\nAnderson had been working on a screenplay about two fighting families.

It was so cohesive, the way Upton Sinclair wrote about that period, and his experiences around the oil fields and these independent oilmen.

Daniel Day-Lewis gave the best and ballsiest performance of the past 10 years. As Daniel Plainview, a prospector who loots the land of its natural resources in silver and oil to fill his pockets and gargantuan ego, he showed us a man draining his humanity for power. And Anderson, having extended Plainview's rage from Earth to heaven in the form of a corrupt preacher (Paul Dano), managed to \"drink the milkshake\" of other risk-taking directors. If I had to stake the future of film in the next decade on one filmmaker, I'd go with PTA. Even more than ''Boogie Nights'' and ''Magnolia''\u2014his rebel cries from the 1990s\u2014''Blood'' let Anderson put technology at the service of character. The score by Radiohead's Jonny Greenwood was a sonic explosion that reinvented what film music could be. And the images captured by Robert Elswit, a genius of camera and lighting, made visual poetry out of an oil well consumed by flame. For the final word on ''Blood'', I'll quote Plainview: \"It was one goddamn hell of a show.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/photos/gallery/31234572/peter_travers_10_best_movies_of_t/photo/10ml |title=Peter Travers' 10 Best Movies of the Decade |work=Rolling Stone Magazine |date=December 10, 2009 |accessdate=December 10, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100114150503/http://www.rollingstone.com/photos/gallery/31234572/peter_travers_10_best_movies_of_t/photo/10ml |archivedate=January 14, 2010 }}</ref></blockquote>\n\n''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' and ''[[At the Movies (1986 TV program)|At the Movies]]'' critic [[Michael Phillips (critic)|Michael Phillips]] named ''There Will Be Blood'' the decade's best film. Phillips stated:\n<blockquote>This most eccentric and haunting of modern epics is driven by oilman Daniel Plainview, who, in the hands of actor Daniel Day-Lewis, becomes a Horatio Alger story gone horribly wrong. Writer/director Paul Thomas Anderson's camera is as crucial to the films hypnotic pull as the performance at its center. For its evocation of the early 1900s, its relentless focus on one man's fascinating obsessions, and for its inspiring example of how to freely adapt a novel\u2014plus, what I think is the performance of the new century\u2014''There Will Be Blood'' stands alone. The more I see it, the sadder, and stranger, and more visually astounding it grows\u2014and the more it seems to say about the best and worst in the American ethos of rugged individualism.

In her original review, Schwarzbaum stated:\n<blockquote>Anyhow, a fierce story meshing big exterior-oriented themes of American character with an interior-oriented portrait of an impenetrable man (two men, really, including the false prophet Sunday) is only half Anderson's quest, and his exciting achievement. The other half lies in the innovation applied to the telling itself. For a huge picture, There Will Be Blood is exquisitely intimate, almost a collection of sketches. For a long, slow movie, it speeds. For a story set in the fabled bad-old-days past, it's got the terrors of modernity in its DNA. Leaps of romantic chordal grandeur from Brahms' Violin Concerto in D Major announce the launch of a fortune-changing oil well down the road from Eli Sunday's church\u2014and then, much later, announce a kind of end of the world.

In the process of dynamiting the [[lode]], he falls and breaks his leg. He saves a silver sample, climbs out of the mine and drags himself to an assay office, where he receives a silver and gold certificate [[land claim|claim]]. In 1902, [[history of oil in California through 1930|he discovers oil near Los Angeles]] and establishes a drilling company. Following the death of a worker in an accident, Daniel adopts the man's orphaned son. The boy, H. W., becomes his nominal business partner, allowing Daniel to present himself to potential investors as a family man.\n\nIn 1911, Daniel is approached by Paul Sunday, a young man who tells him of an oil deposit under his family's property in Little Boston, California. Daniel attempts to purchase the farm from the Sundays at a bargain price, but he is blocked by Eli, Paul's twin brother and a local evangelical preacher. In exchange for the rights to the property, Eli demands $10,000 \"for his church.\" An agreement is made and Daniel acquires all the available land in and around the Sunday property, save for one holdout: William Bandy.\n\nOil drilling commences, but soon a series of misfortunes occur: an accident kills one worker and a [[blowout (well drilling)|gas blowout]] deafens H. W. Eli blames the disasters on the well not being properly blessed. When Eli publicly demands the money still owed to him, Daniel beats and humiliates him. At the dinner table that night, Eli attacks and berates his father for trusting Daniel.\n\nA man arrives at Daniel's doorstep claiming to be his half-brother, Henry. Daniel hires Henry and the two grow close. A jealous H. W. sets fire to their house, intending to kill Henry. A furious Daniel sends H. W. away to a school for the deaf in [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]]. A representative from [[Standard Oil]] offers to buy out Daniel's local interests, but after a perceived slight, Daniel refuses and strikes a deal with [[Union Oil]] to build a pipeline to the California coast. However, Bandy's ranch remains an impediment.\n\nReminiscing about his childhood, Daniel becomes suspicious to the truth of Henry's story and confronts him one night at gunpoint. \"Henry\" confesses that he was a friend of the real Henry, who died of [[tuberculosis]], and that he impersonated Henry in hopes of gaining employment with Daniel. In a fit of rage, Daniel murders the impostor and buries his body.\n\nThe next morning, Daniel is awakened by Bandy, who knows of Daniel's crime and wants Daniel to publicly repent in Eli's church in exchange for the pipeline construction rights on his land. As part of his [[baptism]], Eli humiliates Daniel and coerces him into confessing that he abandoned his son. Some time later, as the pipeline is under construction, H. W. is reunited with Daniel and Eli leaves Little Boston for missionary work.\n\nIn 1927, H. W. marries Mary Sunday, the younger sister of Paul and Eli. He visits Daniel, who is now an extremely wealthy but [[alcoholism|alcoholic]] recluse in a large mansion. Through a [[language interpretation|sign language interpreter]], H. W. asks his father to dissolve their partnership so that he can establish his own independent drilling company in [[Mexico]]. Daniel reacts brutally, mocking H. W.'s deafness before revealing his true origins as an orphan \"bastard from a basket.\" H. W. tells Daniel he is glad that they are not related and storms out.\n\nEli visits Daniel, who is drunk in his private [[bowling alley]]. Eli, now a radio preacher, offers to sell Daniel the property rights to the Bandy ranch, as William Bandy has recently died. Daniel agrees on the condition that Eli denounce his faith and his own credibility. Eli reluctantly acquiesces, only for Daniel to then reveal that the property is now worthless because he has already drained its oil by [[slant drilling]] from neighboring wells. Shaken, Eli confesses to being in dire financial straits and to having strayed morally. Daniel taunts Eli in revenge for his own previous humiliation before chasing him around the bowling alley and eventually beats him to death with a bowling pin. Exhausted, Daniel collapses on the floor next to Eli's body and announces that he is \"finished.\"\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Daniel Day-Lewis]] as Daniel Plainview\n* [[Paul Dano]] as Paul Sunday and Eli Sunday\n* [[Kevin J.

Daniel Day-Lewis gave the best and ballsiest performance of the past 10 years. As Daniel Plainview, a prospector who loots the land of its natural resources in silver and oil to fill his pockets and gargantuan ego, he showed us a man draining his humanity for power. And Anderson, having extended Plainview's rage from Earth to heaven in the form of a corrupt preacher (Paul Dano), managed to \"drink the milkshake\" of other risk-taking directors. If I had to stake the future of film in the next decade on one filmmaker, I'd go with PTA. Even more than ''Boogie Nights'' and ''Magnolia''\u2014his rebel cries from the 1990s\u2014''Blood'' let Anderson put technology at the service of character. The score by Radiohead's Jonny Greenwood was a sonic explosion that reinvented what film music could be. And the images captured by Robert Elswit, a genius of camera and lighting, made visual poetry out of an oil well consumed by flame. For the final word on ''Blood'', I'll quote Plainview: \"It was one goddamn hell of a show.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/photos/gallery/31234572/peter_travers_10_best_movies_of_t/photo/10ml |title=Peter Travers' 10 Best Movies of the Decade |work=Rolling Stone Magazine |date=December 10, 2009 |accessdate=December 10, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100114150503/http://www.rollingstone.com/photos/gallery/31234572/peter_travers_10_best_movies_of_t/photo/10ml |archivedate=January 14, 2010 }}</ref></blockquote>\n\n''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' and ''[[At the Movies (1986 TV program)|At the Movies]]'' critic [[Michael Phillips (critic)|Michael Phillips]] named ''There Will Be Blood'' the decade's best film.

Writer/director Paul Thomas Anderson's camera is as crucial to the films hypnotic pull as the performance at its center. For its evocation of the early 1900s, its relentless focus on one man's fascinating obsessions, and for its inspiring example of how to freely adapt a novel\u2014plus, what I think is the performance of the new century\u2014''There Will Be Blood'' stands alone.

In her original review, Schwarzbaum stated:\n<blockquote>Anyhow, a fierce story meshing big exterior-oriented themes of American character with an interior-oriented portrait of an impenetrable man (two men, really, including the false prophet Sunday) is only half Anderson's quest, and his exciting achievement. The other half lies in the innovation applied to the telling itself. For a huge picture, There Will Be Blood is exquisitely intimate, almost a collection of sketches. For a long, slow movie, it speeds. For a story set in the fabled bad-old-days past, it's got the terrors of modernity in its DNA. Leaps of romantic chordal grandeur from Brahms' Violin Concerto in D Major announce the launch of a fortune-changing oil well down the road from Eli Sunday's church\u2014and then, much later, announce a kind of end of the world.
