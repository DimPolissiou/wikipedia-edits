He was born with the last name Pizzute because his father, Bob, had legally changed his name (his birth name having been Robert Edward Casale) to that of his foster parents. Four years after Gerald's birth, his father changed his name back to his birth name.

Around this time, members of Devo appeared in the film ''[[The Spirit of '76 (1990 film)|The Spirit of '76]]'', except for Bob Mothersbaugh. Following the split, Casale began a career as a director of music videos and commercials, working with bands including [[Rush (band)|Rush]], [[Soundgarden]], [[Silverchair]] and the [[Foo Fighters]].\n\nIn 2005, Devo recorded a new version of \"[[Whip It (Devo song)|Whip It]]\" to be used in [[Swiffer]] television commercials, a decision they have said they regretted.

Their debut album, a two disc CD/DVD combo entitled ''DEV2.0'', was released on March 14, 2006.

In the music video, PewDiePie criticizes T-Series for alleged tax evasion and for achieving their early success by selling pirated songs. He also mocks how T-Series sent him a [[cease and desist]] letter alleging that his actions and lyrics of \"Bitch Lasagna\" were defamatory. The video also thanks his fans for sticking with him through his YouTube career, referencing past notable videos.<ref name=\"CongratsDexerto\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.dexerto.com/entertainment/watch-pewdiepie-roast-t-series-epic-new-congratulations-diss-track-504410 |title=Watch PewDiePie roast T-Series with epic new 'Congratulations' diss track |last=Glaze |first=Virginia |date=31 March 2019 |website=dexerto.com}}</ref><ref name=\"polygon\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.polygon.com/2019/3/31/18275692/pewdiepie-tseries-feud-concession-diss-track |title=PewDiePie admits defeat to T-Series |last=Radulovic |first=Petrana |date=31 March 2019 |website=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]}}</ref><ref name=\"theverge\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/31/18289617/pewdiepie-tseries-congratulations-subscribe-youtube-diss-track-100-million |title=PewDiePie concedes to T-Series in battle for YouTube\u2019s biggest channel |last=Alexander |first=Julia |date=31 March 2019 |website=[[The Verge]]}}</ref><ref name=\"bbc\">{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-47042761 |title=PewDiePie concedes defeat to YouTube rival T-Series |date=1 April 2019 |work=[[BBC]]}}</ref>\n\nThe day after the song was uploaded to YouTube, PewDiePie regained his lead against T-Series.<ref name=Tobin2019>{{cite web|last=Tobin|first=Ben|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2019/04/02/pewdiepie-back-top-biggest-youtube-channel-over-t-series/3339914002/|title=PewDiePie back on top as largest YouTube channel over Indian music label T-Series|work=[[USA Today]]|date=2 April 2019|accessdate=3 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190404024138/https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2019/04/02/pewdiepie-back-top-biggest-youtube-channel-over-t-series/3339914002/|archive-date=4 April 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Eight days after the release of \"Congratulations,\" both music videos were banned in India when the [[Delhi High Court]] granted an injunction in favor of T-Series.<ref name=\"DissTracksBanned1\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.medianama.com/2019/04/223-delhi-high-court-orders-youtube-to-remove-pewdiepie-diss-tracks-on-t-series/ |title=Delhi High Court orders YouTube to remove PewDiePie \"diss tracks\" on T-Series |last=Babele |first=Aryan |date=12 April 2019 |website=Medianama |access-date=13 November 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"DissTracksBanned2\">{{Cite web |url=https://roguerocket.com/2019/04/15/pewdiepies-t-series-diss-tracks-banned-in-india/ |title=PewDiePie\u2019s T-Series Diss Tracks Banned in India |last=Stenn |first=Lili |date=15 April 2019 |website=Rogue Rocket |access-date=13 November 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"DissTracksBanned3\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2019/04/11/india-v-pewdiepie/ |title=India Clamps Down on PewDiePie Racism \u2014 High Court Orders YouTube to Remove Two Offensive Videos |last=Sanchz |first=Daniel |date=11 April 2019 |website=Digital Music News |access-date=21 November 2019}}</ref>\n\nOn 23 October 2019, following PewDiePie's surpassing 100 million subscribers and a few months of Minecraft gameplay videos, PewDiePie released \"Mine All Day (Minecraft music video)\".

He featured regularly in Colchester's senior youth sides prior to his 16th birthday and finished as top scorer in both of his apprenticeship years with the club.
