Over the next four days, the low continued to organise, and acquired enough organization for the IMD to begin bulletins on Depression ARB 03 on October 24. At the same time, the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert on the depression. Later that day, the depression intensified into a deep depression; around the same time, the JTWC recognized it as ''Tropical Cyclone 04A'' and began warnings. It further intensified and became a cyclonic storm, receiving the name ''Kyarr'' from IMD as the fifth cyclonic storm of the season. On October 25, owing to high sea surface temperatures, low shear and a moist environment, Kyarr began a period of [[rapid intensification]] and strengthened into a very severe cyclonic storm. Three hours later, Kyarr became an extremely severe cyclonic storm. Early on October 27, Kyarr intensified into a super cyclonic storm, becoming the first one in the basin since [[Cyclone Gonu|Gonu]] in 2007.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Choudhary|first=Srishti|url=https://www.livemint.com/news/india/kyarr-intensifies-becomes-the-first-super-cyclone-in-arabian-sea-in-12-years-11572168570934.html|title=Kyarr intensifies, becomes the first Super Cyclone in Arabian Sea in 12 years|publisher=Livemint|date=27 October 2019|accessdate=27 October 2019}}</ref> Operationally, the IMD estimated the cyclone to have reached a peak intensity of 135 kt (155 mph; 250 km/h), with a pressure of 915 mbar, but retrospectively downgraded the cyclone to 130 kt (240 km/h; 150 mph) in post-analysis.
