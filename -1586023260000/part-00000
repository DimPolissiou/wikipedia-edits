The curves form a ''hysteresis loop''.]]\n'''Hysteresis''' is the dependence of the state of a system on its history. For example, a [[magnet]] may have more than one possible [[magnetic moment]] in a given [[magnetic field]], depending on how the field changed in the past. Plots of a single component of the moment often form a loop or hysteresis curve, where there are different values of one variable depending on the direction of change of another variable. This history dependence is the basis of memory in a [[hard disk drive]] and the [[remanence]] that retains a record of the [[Earth's magnetic field]] magnitude in the past. Hysteresis occurs in [[ferromagnetic]] and [[ferroelectricity|ferroelectric]] materials, as well as in the [[deformation (mechanics)|deformation]] of [[rubber band]]s and [[shape-memory alloy]]s and many other natural phenomena. In natural systems it is often associated with [[irreversible process|irreversible thermodynamic change]] such as [[phase transitions]] and with [[internal friction]]; and [[dissipation]] is a common side effect.\n\nHysteresis can be found in [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[engineering]], [[biology]], and [[economics]]. It is incorporated in many artificial systems: for example, in [[thermostat]]s and [[Schmitt trigger]]s, it prevents unwanted frequent switching.\n\nHysteresis can be a dynamic [[lag]] between an input and an output that disappears if the input is varied more slowly; this is known as ''rate-dependent'' hysteresis. However, phenomena such as the magnetic hysteresis loops are mainly ''rate-independent'', which makes a durable memory possible.\n\nSystems with hysteresis are [[Nonlinear system|nonlinear]], and can be mathematically challenging to model. Some models such as the [[Preisach model of hysteresis|Preisach model]] (originally applied to ferromagnetism) and the  [[Bouc\u2013Wen model of hysteresis|Bouc\u2013Wen model]] attempt to capture general features of hysteresis; and there are also phenomenological models for particular phenomena such as the [[Jiles\u2013Atherton model]] for ferromagnetism. See also [[Hysteretic model]].\n{{TOC limit|depth=2}}\n\n==Etymology and history==\n\nThe term \"hysteresis\" is derived from {{lang|grc|\u1f51\u03c3\u03c4\u03ad\u03c1\u03b7\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2}}, an [[Ancient Greek]] word meaning \"deficiency\" or \"lagging behind\". It was coined around 1890 by [[James Alfred Ewing|Sir James Alfred Ewing]] to describe the behaviour of magnetic materials.\n\nSome early work on describing hysteresis in mechanical systems was performed by [[James Clerk Maxwell]]. Subsequently, hysteretic models have received significant attention in the works of [[Ferenc Preisach]] ([[Preisach model of hysteresis]]), [[Louis N\u00e9el]] and [[Douglas Hugh Everett]] in connection with magnetism and absorption. A more formal mathematical theory of systems with hysteresis was developed in the 1970s by a group of Russian mathematicians led by [[Mark Krasnosel'skii]].<ref name=\"Mayergoyz2003\">{{cite book|first=Isaak D.|last= Mayergoyz|title= Mathematical Models of Hysteresis and their Applications: Second Edition (Electromagnetism)|authorlink=Isaak D. Mayergoyz|publisher= [[Academic Press]]|year= 2003 |isbn=978-0-12-480873-7}}</ref>\n\n==Types==\n\n===Rate-dependent===\n\nOne type of hysteresis is a [[lag]] between input and output. An example is a [[sine wave|sinusoidal]] input {{math|<var>X(t)</var>}} that results in a sinusoidal output {{math|<var>Y(t)</var>}}, but with a phase lag {{math|<var>&phi;</var>}}:\n:<math> \\begin{align}\nX(t) &= X_0 \\sin \\omega t \\\\ Y(t) &= Y_0 \\sin\\left(\\omega t-\\varphi\\right).\n\\end{align}</math>\nSuch behavior can occur in linear systems, and a more general form of response is\n:<math> Y(t) = \\chi_\\text{i} X(t) + \\int_0^{\\infty} \\Phi_\\text{d} (\\tau) X(t-\\tau) \\, \\mathrm{d}\\tau, </math>\nwhere <math>\\chi_\\text{i}</math> is the instantaneous response and <math>\\Phi_d(\\tau)</math> is the [[impulse response]] to an impulse that occurred <math>\\tau</math> time units in the past.  In the [[frequency domain]], input and output are related by a complex ''generalized susceptibility'' that can be computed from <math>\\Phi_d</math>; it is mathematically equivalent to a [[transfer function]] in linear filter theory and analogue signal processing.<ref name=Bertotti1998ch2>{{cite book |last1=Bertotti |first1=Giorgio |title=Hysteresis in magnetism: For physicists, materials scientists, and engineers |publisher=[[Academic Press]] |year=1998 |isbn=978-0-12-093270-2 |chapter=Ch. 2}}</ref>\n\nThis kind of hysteresis is often referred to as ''rate-dependent hysteresis''. If the input is reduced to zero, the output continues to respond for a finite time. This constitutes a memory of the past, but a limited one because it disappears as the output decays to zero. The phase lag depends on the frequency of the input, and goes to zero as the frequency decreases.<ref name=\"Bertotti1998ch2\" />\n\nWhen rate-dependent hysteresis is due to [[dissipative]] effects like [[friction]], it is associated with power loss.<ref name=\"Bertotti1998ch2\" />\n\n===Rate-independent===\n\nSystems with ''rate-independent hysteresis'' have a ''persistent'' memory of the past that remains after the transients have died out.<ref name=rate>The term is attributed to {{harvnb|Truesdell|Noll|1965}} by {{harvnb|Visintin|1994|loc=page 13}}.</ref> The future development of such a system depends on the history of states visited, but does not fade as the events recede into the past. If an input variable {{math|<var>X(t)</var>}} cycles from  {{math|<var>X</var><sub>0</sub>}}  to {{math|<var>X</var><sub>1</sub>}} and back again, the output {{math|<var>Y(t)</var>}}  may be  {{math|<var>Y</var><sub>0</sub>}} initially but a different value  {{math|<var>Y</var><sub>2</sub>}} upon return. The values of  {{math|<var>Y(t)</var>}} depend on the path of values that  {{math|<var>X(t)</var>}} passes through but not on the speed at which it traverses the path.<ref name=\"Bertotti1998ch2\"/> Many authors restrict the term hysteresis to mean only rate-independent hysteresis.<ref name=Visintin1994p13>{{harvnb|Visintin|1994|loc=page 13}}</ref> Hysteresis effects can be characterized using the [[Preisach model]] and the generalized [[Prandtl\u2212Ishlinskii model]].<ref>Mohammad Al Janaideh, Subhash Rakheja, Chun-Yi Su [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=5510155&tag=1 An analytical generalized Prandtl\u2013Ishlinskii model inversion for hysteresis compensation in micropositioning control], IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics,  Volume:16 Issue:4, pp 734\u2212744, 15 July 2010</ref>\n\n==In engineering==\n\n===Control systems===\n\nIn control systems, hysteresis can be used to filter signals  so that the output reacts less rapidly than it otherwise would, by taking recent history into account. For example, a [[thermostat]] controlling a heater may switch the heater on when the temperature drops below A, but not turn it off until the temperature rises above B. (For instance, if one wishes to maintain a temperature of 20&nbsp;\u00b0C then one might set the thermostat to turn the heater on when the temperature drops to below 18&nbsp;\u00b0C and off when the temperature exceeds 22&nbsp;\u00b0C).\n\nSimilarly, a pressure switch can be designed to exhibit hysteresis, with pressure set-points substituted for temperature thresholds.\n\n===Electronic circuits===\n\n[[Image:Hysteresis sharp curve.svg|thumb|Sharp hysteresis loop of a [[Schmitt trigger]]]]\nOften, some amount of hysteresis is intentionally added to an electronic circuit to prevent unwanted rapid switching. This and similar techniques are used to compensate for [[Switch#Contact bounce|contact bounce]] in switches, or [[Noise (electronic)|noise]] in an electrical signal.\n\nA [[Schmitt trigger]] is a simple electronic circuit that exhibits this property.\n\nA [[Relay#Latching relay|latching relay]] uses a [[solenoid]] to actuate a ratcheting mechanism that keeps the relay closed even if power to the relay is terminated.\n\nHysteresis is essential to the workings of some [[memristor]]s (circuit components which \"remember\" changes in the current passing through them by changing their resistance).<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.eetimes.com/news/latest/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=207403521&pgno=1 |title='Missing link' memristor created: Rewrite the textbooks? |last1=Johnson |first1=R. Colin |newspaper=EE Times April 30, 2008 |accessdate=27 September 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120930074814/http://www.eetimes.com/news/latest/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=207403521&pgno=1 |archive-date=30 September 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nHysteresis can be used when connecting arrays of elements such as [[nanoelectronic]]s, [[electrochrome cell]]s and [[memory effect]] devices using [[passive matrix addressing]]. Shortcuts are made between adjacent components (see [[crosstalk]]) and the hysteresis helps to keep the components in a particular state while the other components change states. Thus, all rows can be addressed at the same time instead of individually.\n\nIn the field of audio electronics, a [[noise gate]] often implements hysteresis intentionally to prevent the gate from \"chattering\" when signals close to its threshold are applied.\n\n===User interface design===\n\nA hysteresis is sometimes intentionally added to computer algorithms. The field of [[user interface design]] has borrowed the term hysteresis to refer to times when the state of the user interface intentionally lags behind the apparent user input. For example, a menu that was drawn in response to a mouse-over event may remain on-screen for a brief moment after the mouse has moved out of the trigger region and the menu region.

The angle of attack at which the flow on top of the wing reattaches is generally lower than the angle of attack at which the flow separates during the increase of the angle of attack.<ref>{{cite conference |url=http://www.public.iastate.edu/~huhui/paper/2008/AIAA-2008-0315.pdf |title=An Experimental Investigation on Aerodynamic Hysteresis of a Low-Reynolds Number Airfoil |author=Zifeng Yang |authorlink= |author2=Hirofumi Igarashi |author3=Mathew Martin |author4=Hui Hu |date=Jan 7\u201310, 2008 |publisher=American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics |conference=46th AIAA Aerospace Sciences Meeting and Exhibit  |pages= |location=Reno, Nevada |id=AIAA-2008-0315 }}</ref>\n\n===Backlash===\n\nMoving parts within machines, such as the components of a [[gear train]], normally have a small gap between them, to allow  movement and lubrication.

The area in the centre of the hysteresis loop is the energy dissipated due to internal friction.]]\nIn the elastic hysteresis of rubber, the area in the centre of a hysteresis loop is the energy dissipated due to material [[internal friction]].\n\nElastic hysteresis was one of the first types of hysteresis to be examined.<ref name=\"LoveTreatise\">{{cite book |author=Love, Augustus E. |title=Treatise on the Mathematical Theory of Elasticity (Dover Books on Physics & Chemistry) |publisher=Dover Publications |location=New York |year=1927 |isbn=978-0-486-60174-8}}</ref><ref name=\"Ewing\">{{cite journal |first1=J.

If the top of a rubber band is hung on a hook and small weights are attached to the bottom of the band one at a time, it will stretch and get longer. As more weights are ''loaded'' onto it, the band will continue to stretch because the force the weights are exerting on the band is increasing. When each weight is taken off, or ''unloaded'', the band will contract as the force is reduced. As the weights are taken off, each weight that produced a specific length as it was loaded onto the band now contracts less, resulting a slightly longer length as it is unloaded. This is because the band does not obey [[Hooke's law]] perfectly. The hysteresis loop of an idealized rubber band is shown in the figure.\n\nIn terms of force, the rubber band was harder to stretch when it was being loaded than when it was being unloaded. In terms of time, when the band is unloaded, the effect (the length) lagged behind the cause (the force of the weights) because the length has not yet reached the value it had for the same weight during the loading part of the cycle. In terms of energy, more energy was required during the loading than the unloading, the excess energy being dissipated as thermal energy.\n\nElastic hysteresis is more pronounced when the loading and unloading is done quickly than when it is done slowly.<ref>{{cite journal|first1=B. |last1=Hopkinson |first2=G.

Materials such as rubber exhibit a high degree of elastic hysteresis.\n\nWhen the intrinsic hysteresis of rubber is being measured, the material can be considered to behave like a gas. When a rubber band is stretched it heats up, and if it is suddenly released, it cools down perceptibly. These effects correspond to a large hysteresis from the thermal exchange with the environment and a smaller hysteresis due to internal friction within the rubber. This proper, intrinsic hysteresis can be measured only if the rubber band is adiabatically isolated.\n\nSmall vehicle suspensions using [[rubber]] (or other [[elastomer]]s) can achieve the dual function of springing and damping because rubber, unlike metal springs, has pronounced hysteresis and does not return all the absorbed compression energy on the rebound. [[Mountain bike]]s have made use of elastomer suspension, as did the original [[Mini]] car.\n\nThe primary cause of [[rolling resistance]] when a body (such as a ball, tire, or wheel) rolls on a surface is hysteresis. This is attributed to the [[viscoelasticity|viscoelastic characteristics]] of the material of the rolling body.\n\n===Contact angle hysteresis===\nThe [[contact angle]] formed between a liquid and solid phase will exhibit a range of contact angles that are possible. There are two common methods for measuring this range of contact angles. The first method is referred to as the tilting base method. Once a drop is dispensed on the surface with the surface level, the surface is then tilted from 0\u00b0 to 90\u00b0. As the drop is tilted, the downhill side will be in a state of imminent wetting while the uphill side will be in a state of imminent dewetting. As the tilt increases the downhill contact angle will increase and represents the advancing contact angle while the uphill side will decrease; this is the receding contact angle. The values for these angles just prior to the drop releasing will typically represent the advancing and receding contact angles. The difference between these two angles is the contact angle hysteresis.\n\nThe second method is often referred to as the add/remove volume method. When the maximum liquid volume is removed from the drop without the [[interfacial area]] decreasing the receding contact angle is thus measured. When volume is added to the maximum before the interfacial area increases, this is the [[advancing contact angle]]. As with the tilt method, the difference between the advancing and receding contact angles is the contact angle hysteresis. Most researchers prefer the tilt method; the add/remove method requires that a tip or needle stay embedded in the drop which can affect the accuracy of the values, especially the receding contact angle.\n\n=== Bubble shape hysteresis ===\nThe equilibrium shapes of [[Bubble (physics)|bubbles]] expanding and contracting on capillaries ([[Hypodermic needle#Non-specialist use|blunt needles]]) can exhibit hysteresis depending on the relative magnitude of the [[Maximum bubble pressure method#Maximum bubble pressure method|maximum capillary pressure]] to ambient pressure, and the relative magnitude of the bubble volume at the maximum capillary pressure to the dead volume in the system.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Chandran Suja|first=V.|last2=Frostad|first2=J.

During expansion, bubbles undergo large non equilibrium jumps in volume, while during contraction the bubbles are more stable and undergo a relatively smaller jump in volume resulting in an asymmetry across expansion and contraction. The bubble shape hysteresis is qualitatively similar to the adsorption hysteresis, and as in the contact angle hysteresis, the interfacial properties play an important role in bubble shape hysteresis.\n\nThe existence of the bubble shape hysteresis has important consequences in [[Surface rheology|interfacial rheology]] experiments involving bubbles. As a result of the hysteresis, not all sizes of the bubbles can be formed on a capillary. Further the gas compressibility causing  the hysteresis leads to unintended complications in the phase relation between the applied changes in interfacial area to the expected interfacial stresses. These difficulties can be avoided by designing experimental systems to avoid the bubble shape hysteresis.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Alvarez|first=Nicolas J.|last2=Walker|first2=Lynn M.|last3=Anna|first3=Shelley L.|date=2010-08-17|title=A Microtensiometer To Probe the Effect of Radius of Curvature on Surfactant Transport to a Spherical Interface|journal=Langmuir|volume=26|issue=16|pages=13310\u201313319|doi=10.1021/la101870m|pmid=20695573|issn=0743-7463}}</ref>\n\n===Adsorption hysteresis===\nHysteresis can also occur during physical [[adsorption]] processes. In this type of hysteresis, the quantity adsorbed is different when gas is being added than it is when being removed. The specific causes of adsorption hysteresis are still an active area of research, but it is linked to differences in the nucleation and evaporation mechanisms inside mesopores. These mechanisms are further complicated by effects such as [[cavitation]] and pore blocking.\n\nIn physical adsorption, hysteresis is evidence of [[mesoporosity]]-indeed, the definition of mesopores (2\u201350&nbsp;nm) is associated with the appearance (50&nbsp;nm) and disappearance (2&nbsp;nm) of mesoporosity in nitrogen adsorption isotherms as a function of Kelvin radius.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Gregg |first1=S.

[[Matric potential]] measurements (\u03a8<sub>m</sub>) are converted to volumetric water content (\u03b8) measurements based on a site or soil specific calibration curve. Hysteresis is a source of water content measurement error. Matric potential hysteresis arises from differences in wetting behaviour causing dry medium to re-wet; that is, it depends on the saturation history of the porous medium. Hysteretic behaviour means that, for example, at a matric potential (\u03a8<sub>m</sub>) of {{nowrap|5 kPa}}, the volumetric water content (\u03b8) of a fine sandy soil matrix could be anything between 8% to 25%.<ref>{{cite mailing list |url=http://www.sowacs.com/archives/99-04/msg00000.html |title=Subject: Accuracy of capacitance soil moisture ... |date=8 April 1999 |accessdate=28 September 2011 |mailinglist=SOWACS |last1=Parkes |first1=Martin |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928150928/http://www.sowacs.com/archives/99-04/msg00000.html |archivedate=28 September 2011 }}</ref>\n\n[[Tensiometer (soil science)|Tensiometer]]s are directly influenced by this type of hysteresis. Two other types of sensors used to measure soil water matric potential are also influenced by hysteresis effects within the sensor itself. Resistance blocks, both nylon and gypsum based, measure matric potential as a function of electrical resistance. The relation between the sensor's electrical resistance and sensor matric potential is hysteretic. Thermocouples measure matric potential as a function of heat dissipation. Hysteresis occurs because measured heat dissipation depends on sensor water content, and the sensor water content\u2013matric potential relationship is hysteretic. {{As of|2002}}, only desorption curves are usually measured during calibration of [[soil moisture sensors]]. Despite the fact that it can be a source of significant error, the sensor specific effect of hysteresis is generally ignored.<ref>\n{{Cite book\n |last1=Scanlon|first1=Bridget R.\n |last2=Andraski|first2=Brian J.\n |last3=Bilskie|first3=Jim\n |year=2002 \n |chapter=3.2.4 Miscellaneous methods for measuring matric or water potential \n |title=Methods of Soil Analysis: Part 4 Physical Methods\n |publisher=Soil Science Society of America \n |series=SSSA Book Series\n |pages=643&ndash;670 \n |isbn=978-0-89118-893-3 \n |chapter-url=http://www.beg.utexas.edu/environqlty/vadose/pdfs/webbio_pdfs/Chapt3-2-4.pdf \n |accessdate=2006-05-26 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060313180113/http://www.beg.utexas.edu/environqlty/vadose/pdfs/webbio_pdfs/Chapt3-2-4.pdf \n |archivedate=2006-03-13 \n |doi=10.2136/sssabookser5.4.c23\n}}</ref>\n\n==In materials==\n\n===Magnetic hysteresis===\n{{main|Magnetic hysteresis}}\n<!--NOTE TO EDITORS: This section is linked to from [[Kilogram]] and [[Magnetic field]].

In general, the magnetization varies (in direction but not magnitude) across a magnet, but in sufficiently small magnets, it does not. In these [[Single domain (magnetic)|single-domain]] magnets, the magnetization responds to a magnetic field by rotating. Single-domain magnets are used wherever a strong, stable magnetization is needed (for example, [[magnetic recording]]).\n\nLarger magnets are divided into regions called ''domains''. Across each domain, the magnetization does not vary; but between domains are relatively thin ''domain walls'' in which the direction of magnetization rotates from the direction of one domain to another. If the magnetic field changes, the walls move, changing the relative sizes of the domains. Because the domains are not magnetized in the same direction, the [[magnetic moment]] per unit volume is smaller than it would be in a single-domain magnet; but domain walls involve rotation of only a small part of the magnetization, so it is much easier to change the magnetic moment. The magnetization can also change by addition or subtraction of domains (called ''nucleation'' and ''denucleation'').\n\n====Magnetic hysteresis models====\nThe most known empirical models in hysteresis are [[Preisach model of hysteresis|Preisach]] and [[Jiles-Atherton model]]s. These models allow an accurate modeling of the hysteresis loop and are widely used in the industry. However, these models lose the connection with thermodynamics and the energy consistency is not ensured. A more recent model, with a more consistent thermodynamical foundation, is  the vectorial incremental nonconservative consistent hysteresis (VINCH) model of Lavet et al. (2011)<ref>Vincent Francois-Lavet et al (2011-11-14). [http://vincent.francois-l.be/VINCH_model.pdf Vectorial Incremental Nonconservative Consistent Hysteresis model].</ref>\n\n====Applications====\n{{Main|Magnet#Common uses of magnets}}\n\nThere are a great variety of applications of the hysteresis in ferromagnets. Many of these make use of their ability to retain a memory, for example [[magnetic tape]], [[hard disks]], and [[credit card]]s. In these applications, ''hard'' magnets (high coercivity) like [[iron]] are desirable so the memory is not easily erased.\n\nMagnetically ''soft'' (low coercivity) iron  is used for the cores in [[electromagnet]]s. The low coercivity reduces that energy loss associated with hysteresis. The low energy loss during a hysteresis loop is also the reason why soft iron is used for transformer cores and electric motors.\n\n===Electrical hysteresis===\n\nElectrical hysteresis typically occurs in [[ferroelectric]] material, where domains of polarization contribute to the total polarization. Polarization is the [[electrical dipole moment]] (either [[coulomb|C]]\u00b7[[metre|m]]<SUP>\u22122</SUP> or [[coulomb|C]]\u00b7[[metre|m]]). The mechanism, an organization of the polarization into domains, is similar to that of magnetic hysteresis.\n\n===Liquid\u2013solid-phase transitions===\nHysteresis manifests itself in state transitions when [[melting point|melting temperature]] and freezing temperature do not agree. For example, [[agar]] melts at 85 [[Celsius|\u00b0C]] and solidifies from 32 to 40&nbsp;\u00b0C. This is to say that once agar is melted at 85&nbsp;\u00b0C, it retains a liquid state until cooled to 40&nbsp;\u00b0C. Therefore, from the temperatures of 40 to 85&nbsp;\u00b0C, agar can be either solid or liquid, depending on which state it was before.\n\n==In biology==\n\n===Cell biology and genetics===\n{{Main|Cell biology}}\nHysteresis in cell biology often follows [[Bistability#In biological and chemical systems|bistable systems]] where the same input state can lead to two different, stable outputs. Where bistability can lead to digital, switch-like outputs from the continuous inputs of chemical concentrations and activities, hysteresis makes these systems more resistant to noise. These systems are often characterized by higher values of the input required to switch into a particular state as compared to the input required to stay in the state, allowing for a transition that is not continuously reversible, and thus less susceptible to noise. \n \nCells undergoing [[cell division]] exhibit hysteresis in that it takes a higher concentration of [[cyclin]]s to switch them from G2 phase into [[mitosis]] than to stay in mitosis once begun.<ref>{{cite journal\n|first1 = Joseph R.\n|last1=Pomerening\n|first2= Eduardo D.\n|last2=Sontag\n|first3= James E.\n|last3=Ferrell\n|year = 2003\n|title = Building a cell cycle oscillator: hysteresis and bistability in the activation of Cdc2\n|journal = Nature Cell Biology\n|pmid = 12629549\n|volume = 5\n|issue = 4\n|pages = 346&ndash;251\n|doi = 10.1038/ncb954}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Ferrell JE Jr. |author2=Machleder EM |title=The biochemical basis of an all-or-none cell fate switch in Xenopus oocytes|journal=Science|date=1998|volume=280|issue=5365|pages=895\u20138|pmid=9572732|doi=10.1126/science.280.5365.895|bibcode=1998Sci...280..895F}}</ref>\n\nBiochemical systems can also show hysteresis-like output when slowly varying states that are not directly monitored are involved, as in the case of the cell cycle arrest in yeast exposed to mating pheromone.<ref name=\"Doncic 2013\">{{cite journal| author1 = Doncic, Andreas| author2 = Skotheim, Jan M| title=Feedforward regulation ensures stability and rapid reversibility of a cellular state| journal= Molecular Cell| year=2013| volume=50| issue=6| pmc=3696412| pmid=23685071| doi=10.1016/j.molcel.2013.04.014| pages=856\u201368}}</ref> Here, the duration of cell cycle arrest depends not only on the final level of input Fus3, but also on the previously achieved Fus3 levels. This effect is achieved due to the slower time scales involved in the transcription of intermediate Far1, such that the total Far1 activity reaches its equilibrium value slowly, and for transient changes in Fus3 concentration, the response of the system depends on the Far1 concentration achieved with the transient value. Experiments in this type of hysteresis benefit from the ability to change the concentration of the inputs with time. The mechanisms are often elucidated by allowing independent control of the concentration of the key intermediate, for instance, by using an inducible promoter.\n\n{{Main|Chromatin}}\nDarlington in his classic works on [[genetics]]<ref>{{cite book |last1=Darlington |first1=C.

For example, [[export]] performance is subject to strong hysteresis effects: because of the fixed transportation costs it may take a big push to start a country's exports, but once the transition is made, not much may be required to keep them going.\n\nWhen some negative shock reduces employment in a company or industry, fewer employed workers then remain. As usually the employed workers have the power to set wages, their reduced number incentivizes them to bargain for even higher wages when the economy again gets better instead of letting the wage be at the [[equilibrium wage]] level, where the supply and demand of workers would match. This causes hysteresis: the unemployment becomes permanently higher after negative shocks.<ref name=Ball/><ref>{{cite journal |url=https://www.nber.org/chapters/c4245 |title=Hysteresis and the European Unemployment Problem |first1=Olivier J. |last1=Blanchard |first2=Lawrence H. |last2=Summers |journal=NBER Macroeconomics Annual |volume=1 |year= 1986 |pages=15&ndash;78 |doi=10.2307/3585159|jstor=3585159 }}</ref>\n\n===Permanently higher unemployment===\n\nThe idea of hysteresis is used extensively in the area of labor economics, specifically with reference to the [[unemployment rate]].<ref name=Hargreaves-Heap>S.P. Hargreaves Heap (1980). \"Choosing the Wrong `Natural' Rate: Accelerating Inflation or Decelerating Employment and Growth?\" The Economic Journal Vol. 90, No. 359 (Sep., 1980), pp. 611-620. {{JSTOR|2231931}}</ref> According to theories based on hysteresis, severe economic downturns (recession) and/or persistent stagnation (slow demand growth, usually after a recession) cause unemployed individuals to lose their job skills (commonly developed on the job) or to find that their skills have become obsolete, or become demotivated, disillusioned or depressed or lose job-seeking skills. In addition, employers may use time spent in unemployment as a screening tool, i.e., to weed out less desired employees in hiring decisions. Then, in times of an economic upturn, recovery, or \"boom\", the affected workers will not share in the prosperity, remaining unemployed for long periods (e.g., over 52 weeks). This makes unemployment \"structural\", i.e., extremely difficult to reduce simply by increasing the aggregate demand for products and labor without causing increased inflation.  That is, it is possible that a [[ratchet effect]] in unemployment rates exists, so a short-term rise in unemployment rates tends to persist. For example, traditional anti-inflationary policy (the use of recession to fight inflation) leads to a permanently higher \"natural\" rate of unemployment (more scientifically known as the [[NAIRU]]). This occurs first because inflationary expectations are \"[[sticky (economics)|sticky]]\" downward due to wage and price rigidities (and so adapt slowly over time rather than being approximately correct as in theories of [[rational expectations]]) and second because labor markets do not clear instantly in response to unemployment.\n\nThe existence of hysteresis has been put forward as a possible explanation for the persistently high unemployment of many economies in the 1990s. Hysteresis has been invoked by [[Olivier Blanchard]] among others to explain the differences in long run unemployment rates between Europe and the United States. Labor market reform (usually meaning institutional change promoting more flexible wages, firing, and hiring) or strong demand-side economic growth may not therefore reduce this pool of long-term unemployed. Thus, specific targeted training programs are presented as a possible policy solution.<ref name=Ball>{{cite journal |last=Ball |first=Laurence M. |date=March 2009 |title=Hysteresis in Unemployment: Old and New Evidence |journal=NBER Working Paper No. 14818 |doi=10.3386/w14818 }}</ref> However, the hysteresis hypothesis suggests such training programs are aided by persistently high demand for products (perhaps with [[incomes policies]] to avoid increased inflation), which reduces the transition costs out of unemployment and into paid employment easier.\n\n<br />\n\n==Additional considerations==\n\n===Models of hysteresis===\n\nEach subject that involves hysteresis has models that are specific to the subject.

The curves form a ''hysteresis loop''.]]\n'''Hysteresis''' is the dependence of the state of a system on its history. For example, a [[magnet]] may have more than one possible [[magnetic moment]] in a given [[magnetic field]], depending on how the field changed in the past. Plots of a single component of the moment often form a loop or hysteresis curve, where there are different values of one variable depending on the direction of change of another variable. This history dependence is the basis of memory in a [[hard disk drive]] and the [[remanence]] that retains a record of the [[Earth's magnetic field]] magnitude in the past. Hysteresis occurs in [[ferromagnetic]] and [[ferroelectricity|ferroelectric]] materials, as well as in the [[deformation (mechanics)|deformation]] of [[rubber band]]s and [[shape-memory alloy]]s and many other natural phenomena. In natural systems it is often associated with [[irreversible process|irreversible thermodynamic change]] such as [[phase transitions]] and with [[internal friction]]; and [[dissipation]] is a common side effect.\n\nHysteresis can be found in [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[engineering]], [[biology]], and [[economics]]. It is incorporated in many artificial systems: for example, in [[thermostat]]s and [[Schmitt trigger]]s, it prevents unwanted frequent switching.\n\nHysteresis can be a dynamic [[lag]] between an input and an output that disappears if the input is varied more slowly; this is known as ''rate-dependent'' hysteresis. However, phenomena such as the magnetic hysteresis loops are mainly ''rate-independent'', which makes a durable memory possible.\n\nSystems with hysteresis are [[Nonlinear system|nonlinear]], and can be mathematically challenging to model. Some models such as the [[Preisach model of hysteresis|Preisach model]] (originally applied to ferromagnetism) and the  [[Bouc\u2013Wen model of hysteresis|Bouc\u2013Wen model]] attempt to capture general features of hysteresis; and there are also phenomenological models for particular phenomena such as the [[Jiles\u2013Atherton model]] for ferromagnetism. See also [[Hysteretic model]].\n{{TOC limit|depth=2}}\n\n==Etymology and history==\n\nThe term \"hysteresis\" is derived from {{lang|grc|\u1f51\u03c3\u03c4\u03ad\u03c1\u03b7\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2}}, an [[Ancient Greek]] word meaning \"deficiency\" or \"lagging behind\". It was coined around 1890 by [[James Alfred Ewing|Sir James Alfred Ewing]] to describe the behaviour of magnetic materials.\n\nSome early work on describing hysteresis in mechanical systems was performed by [[James Clerk Maxwell]]. Subsequently, hysteretic models have received significant attention in the works of [[Ferenc Preisach]] ([[Preisach model of hysteresis]]), [[Louis N\u00e9el]] and [[Douglas Hugh Everett]] in connection with magnetism and absorption. A more formal mathematical theory of systems with hysteresis was developed in the 1970s by a group of Russian mathematicians led by [[Mark Krasnosel'skii]].<ref name=\"Mayergoyz2003\">{{cite book|first=Isaak D.|last= Mayergoyz|title= Mathematical Models of Hysteresis and their Applications: Second Edition (Electromagnetism)|authorlink=Isaak D.

If the input is reduced to zero, the output continues to respond for a finite time. This constitutes a memory of the past, but a limited one because it disappears as the output decays to zero.

For example, a [[thermostat]] controlling a heater may switch the heater on when the temperature drops below A, but not turn it off until the temperature rises above B. (For instance, if one wishes to maintain a temperature of 20&nbsp;\u00b0C then one might set the thermostat to turn the heater on when the temperature drops to below 18&nbsp;\u00b0C and off when the temperature exceeds 22&nbsp;\u00b0C).\n\nSimilarly, a pressure switch can be designed to exhibit hysteresis, with pressure set-points substituted for temperature thresholds.\n\n===Electronic circuits===\n\n[[Image:Hysteresis sharp curve.svg|thumb|Sharp hysteresis loop of a [[Schmitt trigger]]]]\nOften, some amount of hysteresis is intentionally added to an electronic circuit to prevent unwanted rapid switching. This and similar techniques are used to compensate for [[Switch#Contact bounce|contact bounce]] in switches, or [[Noise (electronic)|noise]] in an electrical signal.\n\nA [[Schmitt trigger]] is a simple electronic circuit that exhibits this property.\n\nA [[Relay#Latching relay|latching relay]] uses a [[solenoid]] to actuate a ratcheting mechanism that keeps the relay closed even if power to the relay is terminated.\n\nHysteresis is essential to the workings of some [[memristor]]s (circuit components which \"remember\" changes in the current passing through them by changing their resistance).<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.eetimes.com/news/latest/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=207403521&pgno=1 |title='Missing link' memristor created: Rewrite the textbooks? |last1=Johnson |first1=R.

Shortcuts are made between adjacent components (see [[crosstalk]]) and the hysteresis helps to keep the components in a particular state while the other components change states. Thus, all rows can be addressed at the same time instead of individually.\n\nIn the field of audio electronics, a [[noise gate]] often implements hysteresis intentionally to prevent the gate from \"chattering\" when signals close to its threshold are applied.\n\n===User interface design===\n\nA hysteresis is sometimes intentionally added to computer algorithms. The field of [[user interface design]] has borrowed the term hysteresis to refer to times when the state of the user interface intentionally lags behind the apparent user input. For example, a menu that was drawn in response to a mouse-over event may remain on-screen for a brief moment after the mouse has moved out of the trigger region and the menu region. This allows the user to move the mouse directly to an item on the menu, even if part of that direct mouse path is outside of both the trigger region and the menu region. For instance, right-clicking on the desktop in most Windows interfaces will create a menu that exhibits this behavior.\n\n===Aerodynamics===\n\nIn aerodynamics, hysteresis can be observed when decreasing the angle of attack of a wing after stall, regarding the lift and drag coefficients. The angle of attack at which the flow on top of the wing reattaches is generally lower than the angle of attack at which the flow separates during the increase of the angle of attack.<ref>{{cite conference |url=http://www.public.iastate.edu/~huhui/paper/2008/AIAA-2008-0315.pdf |title=An Experimental Investigation on Aerodynamic Hysteresis of a Low-Reynolds Number Airfoil |author=Zifeng Yang |authorlink= |author2=Hirofumi Igarashi |author3=Mathew Martin |author4=Hui Hu |date=Jan 7\u201310, 2008 |publisher=American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics |conference=46th AIAA Aerospace Sciences Meeting and Exhibit  |pages= |location=Reno, Nevada |id=AIAA-2008-0315 }}</ref>\n\n===Backlash===\n\nMoving parts within machines, such as the components of a [[gear train]], normally have a small gap between them, to allow  movement and lubrication.

If the top of a rubber band is hung on a hook and small weights are attached to the bottom of the band one at a time, it will stretch and get longer. As more weights are ''loaded'' onto it, the band will continue to stretch because the force the weights are exerting on the band is increasing. When each weight is taken off, or ''unloaded'', the band will contract as the force is reduced. As the weights are taken off, each weight that produced a specific length as it was loaded onto the band now contracts less, resulting a slightly longer length as it is unloaded. This is because the band does not obey [[Hooke's law]] perfectly. The hysteresis loop of an idealized rubber band is shown in the figure.\n\nIn terms of force, the rubber band was harder to stretch when it was being loaded than when it was being unloaded. In terms of time, when the band is unloaded, the effect (the length) lagged behind the cause (the force of the weights) because the length has not yet reached the value it had for the same weight during the loading part of the cycle. In terms of energy, more energy was required during the loading than the unloading, the excess energy being dissipated as thermal energy.\n\nElastic hysteresis is more pronounced when the loading and unloading is done quickly than when it is done slowly.<ref>{{cite journal|first1=B. |last1=Hopkinson |first2=G.

Materials such as rubber exhibit a high degree of elastic hysteresis.\n\nWhen the intrinsic hysteresis of rubber is being measured, the material can be considered to behave like a gas. When a rubber band is stretched it heats up, and if it is suddenly released, it cools down perceptibly. These effects correspond to a large hysteresis from the thermal exchange with the environment and a smaller hysteresis due to internal friction within the rubber. This proper, intrinsic hysteresis can be measured only if the rubber band is adiabatically isolated.\n\nSmall vehicle suspensions using [[rubber]] (or other [[elastomer]]s) can achieve the dual function of springing and damping because rubber, unlike metal springs, has pronounced hysteresis and does not return all the absorbed compression energy on the rebound. [[Mountain bike]]s have made use of elastomer suspension, as did the original [[Mini]] car.\n\nThe primary cause of [[rolling resistance]] when a body (such as a ball, tire, or wheel) rolls on a surface is hysteresis. This is attributed to the [[viscoelasticity|viscoelastic characteristics]] of the material of the rolling body.\n\n===Contact angle hysteresis===\nThe [[contact angle]] formed between a liquid and solid phase will exhibit a range of contact angles that are possible. There are two common methods for measuring this range of contact angles. The first method is referred to as the tilting base method. Once a drop is dispensed on the surface with the surface level, the surface is then tilted from 0\u00b0 to 90\u00b0. As the drop is tilted, the downhill side will be in a state of imminent wetting while the uphill side will be in a state of imminent dewetting. As the tilt increases the downhill contact angle will increase and represents the advancing contact angle while the uphill side will decrease; this is the receding contact angle. The values for these angles just prior to the drop releasing will typically represent the advancing and receding contact angles. The difference between these two angles is the contact angle hysteresis.\n\nThe second method is often referred to as the add/remove volume method. When the maximum liquid volume is removed from the drop without the [[interfacial area]] decreasing the receding contact angle is thus measured. When volume is added to the maximum before the interfacial area increases, this is the [[advancing contact angle]]. As with the tilt method, the difference between the advancing and receding contact angles is the contact angle hysteresis. Most researchers prefer the tilt method; the add/remove method requires that a tip or needle stay embedded in the drop which can affect the accuracy of the values, especially the receding contact angle.\n\n=== Bubble shape hysteresis ===\nThe equilibrium shapes of [[Bubble (physics)|bubbles]] expanding and contracting on capillaries ([[Hypodermic needle#Non-specialist use|blunt needles]]) can exhibit hysteresis depending on the relative magnitude of the [[Maximum bubble pressure method#Maximum bubble pressure method|maximum capillary pressure]] to ambient pressure, and the relative magnitude of the bubble volume at the maximum capillary pressure to the dead volume in the system.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Chandran Suja|first=V.|last2=Frostad|first2=J.

During expansion, bubbles undergo large non equilibrium jumps in volume, while during contraction the bubbles are more stable and undergo a relatively smaller jump in volume resulting in an asymmetry across expansion and contraction. The bubble shape hysteresis is qualitatively similar to the adsorption hysteresis, and as in the contact angle hysteresis, the interfacial properties play an important role in bubble shape hysteresis.\n\nThe existence of the bubble shape hysteresis has important consequences in [[Surface rheology|interfacial rheology]] experiments involving bubbles. As a result of the hysteresis, not all sizes of the bubbles can be formed on a capillary. Further the gas compressibility causing  the hysteresis leads to unintended complications in the phase relation between the applied changes in interfacial area to the expected interfacial stresses. These difficulties can be avoided by designing experimental systems to avoid the bubble shape hysteresis.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Alvarez|first=Nicolas J.|last2=Walker|first2=Lynn M.|last3=Anna|first3=Shelley L.|date=2010-08-17|title=A Microtensiometer To Probe the Effect of Radius of Curvature on Surfactant Transport to a Spherical Interface|journal=Langmuir|volume=26|issue=16|pages=13310\u201313319|doi=10.1021/la101870m|pmid=20695573|issn=0743-7463}}</ref>\n\n===Adsorption hysteresis===\nHysteresis can also occur during physical [[adsorption]] processes. In this type of hysteresis, the quantity adsorbed is different when gas is being added than it is when being removed. The specific causes of adsorption hysteresis are still an active area of research, but it is linked to differences in the nucleation and evaporation mechanisms inside mesopores. These mechanisms are further complicated by effects such as [[cavitation]] and pore blocking.\n\nIn physical adsorption, hysteresis is evidence of [[mesoporosity]]-indeed, the definition of mesopores (2\u201350&nbsp;nm) is associated with the appearance (50&nbsp;nm) and disappearance (2&nbsp;nm) of mesoporosity in nitrogen adsorption isotherms as a function of Kelvin radius.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Gregg |first1=S.

[[Matric potential]] measurements (\u03a8<sub>m</sub>) are converted to volumetric water content (\u03b8) measurements based on a site or soil specific calibration curve. Hysteresis is a source of water content measurement error. Matric potential hysteresis arises from differences in wetting behaviour causing dry medium to re-wet; that is, it depends on the saturation history of the porous medium. Hysteretic behaviour means that, for example, at a matric potential (\u03a8<sub>m</sub>) of {{nowrap|5 kPa}}, the volumetric water content (\u03b8) of a fine sandy soil matrix could be anything between 8% to 25%.<ref>{{cite mailing list |url=http://www.sowacs.com/archives/99-04/msg00000.html |title=Subject: Accuracy of capacitance soil moisture ... |date=8 April 1999 |accessdate=28 September 2011 |mailinglist=SOWACS |last1=Parkes |first1=Martin |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928150928/http://www.sowacs.com/archives/99-04/msg00000.html |archivedate=28 September 2011 }}</ref>\n\n[[Tensiometer (soil science)|Tensiometer]]s are directly influenced by this type of hysteresis. Two other types of sensors used to measure soil water matric potential are also influenced by hysteresis effects within the sensor itself. Resistance blocks, both nylon and gypsum based, measure matric potential as a function of electrical resistance. The relation between the sensor's electrical resistance and sensor matric potential is hysteretic. Thermocouples measure matric potential as a function of heat dissipation. Hysteresis occurs because measured heat dissipation depends on sensor water content, and the sensor water content\u2013matric potential relationship is hysteretic. {{As of|2002}}, only desorption curves are usually measured during calibration of [[soil moisture sensors]]. Despite the fact that it can be a source of significant error, the sensor specific effect of hysteresis is generally ignored.<ref>\n{{Cite book\n |last1=Scanlon|first1=Bridget R.\n |last2=Andraski|first2=Brian J.\n |last3=Bilskie|first3=Jim\n |year=2002 \n |chapter=3.2.4 Miscellaneous methods for measuring matric or water potential \n |title=Methods of Soil Analysis: Part 4 Physical Methods\n |publisher=Soil Science Society of America \n |series=SSSA Book Series\n |pages=643&ndash;670 \n |isbn=978-0-89118-893-3 \n |chapter-url=http://www.beg.utexas.edu/environqlty/vadose/pdfs/webbio_pdfs/Chapt3-2-4.pdf \n |accessdate=2006-05-26 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060313180113/http://www.beg.utexas.edu/environqlty/vadose/pdfs/webbio_pdfs/Chapt3-2-4.pdf \n |archivedate=2006-03-13 \n |doi=10.2136/sssabookser5.4.c23\n}}</ref>\n\n==In materials==\n\n===Magnetic hysteresis===\n{{main|Magnetic hysteresis}}\n<!--NOTE TO EDITORS: This section is linked to from [[Kilogram]] and [[Magnetic field]].

In general, the magnetization varies (in direction but not magnitude) across a magnet, but in sufficiently small magnets, it does not. In these [[Single domain (magnetic)|single-domain]] magnets, the magnetization responds to a magnetic field by rotating. Single-domain magnets are used wherever a strong, stable magnetization is needed (for example, [[magnetic recording]]).\n\nLarger magnets are divided into regions called ''domains''. Across each domain, the magnetization does not vary; but between domains are relatively thin ''domain walls'' in which the direction of magnetization rotates from the direction of one domain to another. If the magnetic field changes, the walls move, changing the relative sizes of the domains. Because the domains are not magnetized in the same direction, the [[magnetic moment]] per unit volume is smaller than it would be in a single-domain magnet; but domain walls involve rotation of only a small part of the magnetization, so it is much easier to change the magnetic moment. The magnetization can also change by addition or subtraction of domains (called ''nucleation'' and ''denucleation'').\n\n====Magnetic hysteresis models====\nThe most known empirical models in hysteresis are [[Preisach model of hysteresis|Preisach]] and [[Jiles-Atherton model]]s. These models allow an accurate modeling of the hysteresis loop and are widely used in the industry. However, these models lose the connection with thermodynamics and the energy consistency is not ensured. A more recent model, with a more consistent thermodynamical foundation, is  the vectorial incremental nonconservative consistent hysteresis (VINCH) model of Lavet et al. (2011)<ref>Vincent Francois-Lavet et al (2011-11-14). [http://vincent.francois-l.be/VINCH_model.pdf Vectorial Incremental Nonconservative Consistent Hysteresis model].</ref>\n\n====Applications====\n{{Main|Magnet#Common uses of magnets}}\n\nThere are a great variety of applications of the hysteresis in ferromagnets. Many of these make use of their ability to retain a memory, for example [[magnetic tape]], [[hard disks]], and [[credit card]]s. In these applications, ''hard'' magnets (high coercivity) like [[iron]] are desirable so the memory is not easily erased.\n\nMagnetically ''soft'' (low coercivity) iron  is used for the cores in [[electromagnet]]s. The low coercivity reduces that energy loss associated with hysteresis. The low energy loss during a hysteresis loop is also the reason why soft iron is used for transformer cores and electric motors.\n\n===Electrical hysteresis===\n\nElectrical hysteresis typically occurs in [[ferroelectric]] material, where domains of polarization contribute to the total polarization. Polarization is the [[electrical dipole moment]] (either [[coulomb|C]]\u00b7[[metre|m]]<SUP>\u22122</SUP> or [[coulomb|C]]\u00b7[[metre|m]]). The mechanism, an organization of the polarization into domains, is similar to that of magnetic hysteresis.\n\n===Liquid\u2013solid-phase transitions===\nHysteresis manifests itself in state transitions when [[melting point|melting temperature]] and freezing temperature do not agree. For example, [[agar]] melts at 85 [[Celsius|\u00b0C]] and solidifies from 32 to 40&nbsp;\u00b0C. This is to say that once agar is melted at 85&nbsp;\u00b0C, it retains a liquid state until cooled to 40&nbsp;\u00b0C. Therefore, from the temperatures of 40 to 85&nbsp;\u00b0C, agar can be either solid or liquid, depending on which state it was before.\n\n==In biology==\n\n===Cell biology and genetics===\n{{Main|Cell biology}}\nHysteresis in cell biology often follows [[Bistability#In biological and chemical systems|bistable systems]] where the same input state can lead to two different, stable outputs. Where bistability can lead to digital, switch-like outputs from the continuous inputs of chemical concentrations and activities, hysteresis makes these systems more resistant to noise. These systems are often characterized by higher values of the input required to switch into a particular state as compared to the input required to stay in the state, allowing for a transition that is not continuously reversible, and thus less susceptible to noise. \n \nCells undergoing [[cell division]] exhibit hysteresis in that it takes a higher concentration of [[cyclin]]s to switch them from G2 phase into [[mitosis]] than to stay in mitosis once begun.<ref>{{cite journal\n|first1 = Joseph R.\n|last1=Pomerening\n|first2= Eduardo D.\n|last2=Sontag\n|first3= James E.\n|last3=Ferrell\n|year = 2003\n|title = Building a cell cycle oscillator: hysteresis and bistability in the activation of Cdc2\n|journal = Nature Cell Biology\n|pmid = 12629549\n|volume = 5\n|issue = 4\n|pages = 346&ndash;251\n|doi = 10.1038/ncb954}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Ferrell JE Jr. |author2=Machleder EM |title=The biochemical basis of an all-or-none cell fate switch in Xenopus oocytes|journal=Science|date=1998|volume=280|issue=5365|pages=895\u20138|pmid=9572732|doi=10.1126/science.280.5365.895|bibcode=1998Sci...280..895F}}</ref>\n\nBiochemical systems can also show hysteresis-like output when slowly varying states that are not directly monitored are involved, as in the case of the cell cycle arrest in yeast exposed to mating pheromone.<ref name=\"Doncic 2013\">{{cite journal| author1 = Doncic, Andreas| author2 = Skotheim, Jan M| title=Feedforward regulation ensures stability and rapid reversibility of a cellular state| journal= Molecular Cell| year=2013| volume=50| issue=6| pmc=3696412| pmid=23685071| doi=10.1016/j.molcel.2013.04.014| pages=856\u201368}}</ref> Here, the duration of cell cycle arrest depends not only on the final level of input Fus3, but also on the previously achieved Fus3 levels. This effect is achieved due to the slower time scales involved in the transcription of intermediate Far1, such that the total Far1 activity reaches its equilibrium value slowly, and for transient changes in Fus3 concentration, the response of the system depends on the Far1 concentration achieved with the transient value. Experiments in this type of hysteresis benefit from the ability to change the concentration of the inputs with time. The mechanisms are often elucidated by allowing independent control of the concentration of the key intermediate, for instance, by using an inducible promoter.\n\n{{Main|Chromatin}}\nDarlington in his classic works on [[genetics]]<ref>{{cite book |last1=Darlington |first1=C.

For example, [[export]] performance is subject to strong hysteresis effects: because of the fixed transportation costs it may take a big push to start a country's exports, but once the transition is made, not much may be required to keep them going.\n\nWhen some negative shock reduces employment in a company or industry, fewer employed workers then remain. As usually the employed workers have the power to set wages, their reduced number incentivizes them to bargain for even higher wages when the economy again gets better instead of letting the wage be at the [[equilibrium wage]] level, where the supply and demand of workers would match. This causes hysteresis: the unemployment becomes permanently higher after negative shocks.<ref name=Ball/><ref>{{cite journal |url=https://www.nber.org/chapters/c4245 |title=Hysteresis and the European Unemployment Problem |first1=Olivier J. |last1=Blanchard |first2=Lawrence H. |last2=Summers |journal=NBER Macroeconomics Annual |volume=1 |year= 1986 |pages=15&ndash;78 |doi=10.2307/3585159|jstor=3585159 }}</ref>\n\n===Permanently higher unemployment===\n\nThe idea of hysteresis is used extensively in the area of labor economics, specifically with reference to the [[unemployment rate]].<ref name=Hargreaves-Heap>S.P. Hargreaves Heap (1980). \"Choosing the Wrong `Natural' Rate: Accelerating Inflation or Decelerating Employment and Growth?\" The Economic Journal Vol. 90, No. 359 (Sep., 1980), pp. 611-620. {{JSTOR|2231931}}</ref> According to theories based on hysteresis, severe economic downturns (recession) and/or persistent stagnation (slow demand growth, usually after a recession) cause unemployed individuals to lose their job skills (commonly developed on the job) or to find that their skills have become obsolete, or become demotivated, disillusioned or depressed or lose job-seeking skills. In addition, employers may use time spent in unemployment as a screening tool, i.e., to weed out less desired employees in hiring decisions. Then, in times of an economic upturn, recovery, or \"boom\", the affected workers will not share in the prosperity, remaining unemployed for long periods (e.g., over 52 weeks). This makes unemployment \"structural\", i.e., extremely difficult to reduce simply by increasing the aggregate demand for products and labor without causing increased inflation.  That is, it is possible that a [[ratchet effect]] in unemployment rates exists, so a short-term rise in unemployment rates tends to persist. For example, traditional anti-inflationary policy (the use of recession to fight inflation) leads to a permanently higher \"natural\" rate of unemployment (more scientifically known as the [[NAIRU]]). This occurs first because inflationary expectations are \"[[sticky (economics)|sticky]]\" downward due to wage and price rigidities (and so adapt slowly over time rather than being approximately correct as in theories of [[rational expectations]]) and second because labor markets do not clear instantly in response to unemployment.\n\nThe existence of hysteresis has been put forward as a possible explanation for the persistently high unemployment of many economies in the 1990s. Hysteresis has been invoked by [[Olivier Blanchard]] among others to explain the differences in long run unemployment rates between Europe and the United States. Labor market reform (usually meaning institutional change promoting more flexible wages, firing, and hiring) or strong demand-side economic growth may not therefore reduce this pool of long-term unemployed. Thus, specific targeted training programs are presented as a possible policy solution.<ref name=Ball>{{cite journal |last=Ball |first=Laurence M. |date=March 2009 |title=Hysteresis in Unemployment: Old and New Evidence |journal=NBER Working Paper No. 14818 |doi=10.3386/w14818 }}</ref> However, the hysteresis hypothesis suggests such training programs are aided by persistently high demand for products (perhaps with [[incomes policies]] to avoid increased inflation), which reduces the transition costs out of unemployment and into paid employment easier.\n\n===Game theory===\nHysteresis occurs in applications of [[game theory]] to economics, in models with product quality, agent honesty or corruption of various institutions. Slightly different initial conditions can lead to opposite outcomes and resulting stable good and bad [[Correlated equilibrium|equilibria]].{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\n==Additional considerations==\n\n===Models of hysteresis===\n\nEach subject that involves hysteresis has models that are specific to the subject.

This model is able to capture in analytical form, a range of shapes of hysteretic cycles which match the behaviour of a wide class of hysteretical systems; therefore, given its versability and mathematical tractability, the Bouc\u2013Wen model has quickly gained popularity and has been extended and applied to a wide variety of engineering problems, including multi-degree-of-freedom (MDOF) systems, buildings, frames, bidirectional and [[Torsion (mechanics)|torsional]] response of hysteretic systems two- and three-dimensional continua, and [[soil liquefaction]] among others. The Bouc\u2013Wen model and its variants/extensions have been used in applications of [[Structural engineering|structural control]], in particular in the modeling of the behaviour of [[magnetorheological damper]]s, [[base isolation]] devices for buildings and other kinds of damping devices; it has also been used in the modelling and analysis of structures built of reinforced concrete, steel, masonry and timber.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}. The most important extension of Bouc-Wen Model was carried out by Baber and Noori and later by Noori and co-workers.  That extended model, named, BWBN, can reproduce the complex shear pinching or slip-lock phenomenon that earlier model could not reproduce. BWBN model has been widely used in a wide spectrum of applications and have been incorporated in several software codes such as OpenSees.\n\n===Energy===\nWhen hysteresis occurs with [[Intensive and extensive properties|extensive and intensive variable]]s, the work done on the system is the area under the hysteresis graph.\n\n==See also==\n{{Div col}}\n*[[Backlash (engineering)]]\n*[[Bean's critical state model]]\n*[[Black box]]\n*[[Deadband]]\n*[[Fuzzy control system]]<!-- Alternative way to smooth response -->\n*[[Hysteresivity]]\n*[[Markov property]]\n*[[Memristor]]\n*[[Path dependence]]\n*[[Path dependence (physics)]]\n*[[Remanence]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{Refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |last=Chikazumi |first=S\u014dshin |year=1997 |title=Physics of Ferromagnetism |publisher=Clarendon Press |isbn=978-0-19-851776-4 |ref=harv }}\n* {{cite journal |last1=Jiles |first1=D.

The first case in the [[Bailiwick of Guernsey|Bailiwick]] was confirmed on 9 March when a person tested positive in [[Guernsey]] after returning from [[Tenerife]], and transmission within the Bailiwick was confirmed on 24 March. As of 4 April, there have been 136 cases identified in the Bailiwick\u2014all on the island of Guernsey\u2014and 2 people have died from the infection; no cases have been reported in [[Sark]], [[Herm]] or [[Alderney]].\n\nThe response by the [[States of Guernsey]] has been led by the Civil Contingencies Authority (CCA)\u2014a senior cross-committee body responsible for coordinating actions in circumstances which present a serious risk to the health and welfare of the island\u2014chaired by [[Gavin St Pier]] and advised by the senior [[Policy and Resources Committee of Guernsey|Policy and Resources Committee]] (P&R) and the Committee for Health and Social Care (HSC). Following the first confirmed case in the Bailiwick, the CCA enacted the Emergency Powers (Coronavirus) (Bailiwick of Guernsey) Regulations 2020 on 17 March, a statutory instrument which enables the Medical Officer of Health to implement emergency measures enforceable by law; the first of which mandated that anyone arriving in the Bailiwick [[Isolation (health care)#Self-isolation|self-isolate]] for 14 days. Early measures focused on [[behaviour change (public health)|behaviour changing]] publicity; encouraging [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic#Hand washing|hand-washing]], [[Hygiene#Respiratory hygiene|respiratory hygiene]] and [[social distancing]] measures, and advising against non-essential travel. Following the first confirmed case from on-island transmission, the CCA announced an immediate 'lockdown' starting from midnight on 25 March, comprising wide-ranging restrictions on freedom of movement, enforceable in law, whereby people have been ordered to stay at home and 'non-essential' businesses have been ordered to close.\n\nThe pandemic has led to socio-economic disruption, including the [[List of events affected by the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|cancellation and postponement of sporting and cultural events]], the [[Impact of the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic on education|closure of schools and colleges]] except for vulnerable children and children of critical workers, restrictions on travel (both within and to and from the Bailiwick), fears of supply shortages resulting in [[panic buying]] of essential items, and the shutdown of pubs, bars and restaurants (including those offering delivery services). Several schemes and policies have been implemented to provide financial support to businesses and individuals in order to limit the impact of the pandemic on the local economy.

Following the first confirmed case in the Bailiwick, the CCA enacted the Emergency Powers (Coronavirus) (Bailiwick of Guernsey) Regulations 2020 on 17 March, a statutory instrument which enables the Medical Officer of Health to implement emergency measures enforceable by law; the first of which mandated that anyone arriving in the Bailiwick [[Isolation (health care)#Self-isolation|self-isolate]] for 14 days. Early measures focused on [[behaviour change (public health)|behaviour changing]] publicity; encouraging [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic#Hand washing|hand-washing]], [[Hygiene#Respiratory hygiene|respiratory hygiene]] and [[social distancing]] measures, and advising against non-essential travel. Following the first confirmed case from on-island transmission, the CCA announced an immediate 'lockdown' starting from midnight on 25 March, comprising wide-ranging restrictions on freedom of movement, enforceable in law, whereby people have been ordered to stay at home and 'non-essential' businesses have been ordered to close.\n\nThe pandemic has led to socio-economic disruption, including the [[List of events affected by the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|cancellation and postponement of sporting and cultural events]], the [[Impact of the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic on education|closure of schools and colleges]] except for vulnerable children and children of critical workers, restrictions on travel (both within and to and from the Bailiwick), fears of supply shortages resulting in [[panic buying]] of essential items, and the shutdown of pubs, bars and restaurants (including those offering delivery services). Several schemes and policies have been implemented to provide financial support to businesses and individuals in order to limit the impact of the pandemic on the local economy.

Roosevelt to relocate struggling urban and rural families to one of three such communities planned by the government called Greenbelt towns.\n\nThe Greenbelt concept was abandoned in 1949 and the as yet undeveloped acreage of Greenhills, Ohio, which had opened in 1938, became available for purchase by the Warner-Kanter Corporation in 1954. After two years of planning they opened homes for purchase in the first residential area of Forest Park, the C section, in March 1956.\n\nAfter growing to a population of 4800 in 1960 and incorporation as a village in 1961, then achieving city status in 1968, Forest Park intentionally became an \u201copen city,\u201d regularly adopting and passing resolutions and ordinances welcoming citizens regardless of race, creed or national origin, a policy intended to maintain the city's commitment to diversity.\n\nToward this end, in 1978, the Forest Park Housing Commission created \u201cA Comprehensive Strategy for Maintaining Diversity in Forest Park, \u201cto combat discriminatory practices by realtors, builders and corporations.\u201d<ref>City of Forest Park Housing Commission, \u201cA Comprehensive Strategy for Maintaining Diversity in Forest Park,\u201d Typescript, March, 1978, Forest Park Historical Society Archives.</ref>\n\nAfter a 1980 lawsuit filed by the city against a builder was dismissed for insufficient evidence, the Forest Park council issued a statement declaring that \u201cpeople have the right to choose where to live, work or play based on their own free choice.  That right must be secured for all people and never be artificially restricted.\u201d<ref>Forest Park Council, Resolution No. 30-1982, \u201cExpressing the Policy of the Forest Park City Council with Regard to the Issuance of a \u2018Quality of Integrated Life Statement\u2019 in the City of Forest Park,\u201d passed unanimously April 19, 1982; ''Cincinnati Post'', March 20, 29 and 30, 1982; ''Cincinnati Enquirer'', March 27 and 30 and April 20, 1982; ''Millcreek Valley News'', April 8 and 29, 1982.</ref>\n\nThe Quality of Integrated Life resolution of 1982 would serve as a guide to integrated living, reinforcing the long-held view that diversity was a strength of Forest Park as the city moved toward a new century. In 1991 this view was reinforced when a Quality of Life Task Force issued a vision statement reflecting the \u201cshared values of a multicultural citizenry.\u201d<ref>''The New Times'', April 20, 1991.</ref>\n\nIn the minds of its residents and outsiders, Forest Park's commitment to diversity in an open community became a model for 21st century living.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1970= 15139\n|1980= 18770\n|1990= 18609\n|2000= 19463\n|2010= 18720\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=18678\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=June 5, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150426102944/http://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|archivedate=April 26, 2015}}</ref>\n}}\n\n===2010 census===\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name =\"FactFinder\">{{cite web|title=American FactFinder|url=http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml|archive-url=https://archive.today/20200212234628/http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml|url-status=dead|archive-date=2020-02-12|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2013-01-06}}</ref> of 2010, there were 18,720 people, 7,212 households, and 4,924 families living in the city.

Roosevelt to relocate struggling urban and rural families to one of three such communities planned by the government called Greenbelt towns.\n\nThe Greenbelt concept was abandoned in 1949 and the as yet undeveloped acreage of Greenhills, Ohio, which had opened in 1938, became available for purchase by the Warner-Kanter Corporation in 1954. After two years of planning they opened homes for purchase in the first residential area of Forest Park, the C section, in March 1956.\n\nAfter growing to a population of 4800 in 1960 and incorporation as a village in 1961, then achieving city status in 1968, Forest Park intentionally became an \u201copen city,\u201d regularly adopting and passing resolutions and ordinances welcoming citizens regardless of race, creed or national origin, a policy intended to maintain the city\u2019s commitment to diversity.\n\nToward this end, in 1978, the Forest Park Housing Commission created \u201cA Comprehensive Strategy for Maintaining Diversity in Forest Park, \u201cto combat discriminatory practices by realtors, builders and corporations.\u201d<ref>City of Forest Park Housing Commission, \u201cA Comprehensive Strategy for Maintaining Diversity in Forest Park,\u201d Typescript, March, 1978, Forest Park Historical Society Archives.</ref>\n\nAfter a 1980 lawsuit filed by the city against a builder was dismissed for insufficient evidence, the Forest Park council issued a statement declaring that \u201cpeople have the right to choose where to live, work or play based on their own free choice.  That right must be secured for all people and never be artificially restricted.\u201d<ref>Forest Park Council, Resolution No. 30-1982, \u201cExpressing the Policy of the Forest Park City Council with Regard to the Issuance of a \u2018Quality of Integrated Life Statement\u2019 in the City of Forest Park,\u201d passed unanimously April 19, 1982; ''Cincinnati Post'', March 20, 29 and 30, 1982; ''Cincinnati Enquirer'', March 27 and 30 and April 20, 1982; ''Millcreek Valley News'', April 8 and 29, 1982.</ref>\n\nThe Quality of Integrated Life resolution of 1982 would serve as a guide to integrated living, reinforcing the long-held view that diversity was a strength of Forest Park as the city moved toward a new century. In 1991 this view was reinforced when a Quality of Life Task Force issued a vision statement reflecting the \u201cshared values of a multicultural citizenry.\u201d<ref>''The New Times'', April 20, 1991.</ref>\n\nIn the minds of its residents and outsiders, Forest Park\u2019s commitment to diversity in an open community became a model for 21st century living.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1970= 15139\n|1980= 18770\n|1990= 18609\n|2000= 19463\n|2010= 18720\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=18678\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=June 5, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150426102944/http://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|archivedate=April 26, 2015}}</ref>\n}}\n\n===2010 census===\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name =\"FactFinder\">{{cite web|title=American FactFinder|url=http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml|archive-url=https://archive.today/20200212234628/http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml|url-status=dead|archive-date=2020-02-12|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2013-01-06}}</ref> of 2010, there were 18,720 people, 7,212 households, and 4,924 families living in the city.

Miller, you see, is a forgotten but real historical figure, a photographer's model in Vogue in the 1920s, a photographer herself in the 1930s and a fearless photojournalist across Europe during World War II. By any standards she was promiscuous and willful, a free spirit for whom happiness was just beyond her grasp. She is the fascinating focal point for Kreitzer's compelling new play [...], perhaps the best piece of theater at the Playhouse this season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://citybeat.com/cincinnati/article-23063-behind-the-eye-(review).html|title=Behind the Eye (Review)|accessdate=June 25, 2014|first=Rick|last=Pender|date=April 11, 2011|work=CityBeat|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140707155448/http://citybeat.com/cincinnati/article-23063-behind-the-eye-(review).html|archive-date=July 7, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n*''1:23'' from Atlanta's ''Creative Loafing'': Playwright Carson Kreitzer's drama draws on elements of police procedurals like Law & Order in its investigation of the crimes of Susan Smith and two other notorious mothers who killed their children. In 1:23, we know whodunit, so the more pressing question becomes, 'Why did they do it?' Kreitzer's script finds clues in official records, urban legends and Latin-American folklore, placing the killings in complex, almost baffling cultural and psychological contexts. [...] Few themes prove as big or challenging as the ones raised in 1:23. If anything, the play's ambition nearly overleaps itself in its attempt to address too many ideas in too limited a time. 1:23 serves as a harrowing thematic symphony that can be overly pretentious and opaque, yet also builds to some genuine revelations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://clatl.com/atlanta/synchronicitys-123-medea-blitz/Content?oid=1279465|title=Synchronicity's 1:23 Medea blitz |accessdate=June 25, 2014|publisher=Creative Loafing Atlanta|date=April 20, 2009|first=Curt |last=Holman}}</ref>\n*''Valerie Shoots Andy'' from ''[[The New York Times]]'': Ms. Kreitzer offers an assessment of how Solanas's play (''Up Your Ass'') and a diatribe she wrote shortly before the shooting called the SCUM manifesto evolved into gunshots.

Not that the world's premier female superhero makes any direct appearances in the world premiere that opened Tuesday at Marin Theatre Company, but aspects of her infuse the generations of feminists who inspired and were inspired by her in an idea-packed and brilliantly cartoon-enhanced play.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/performance/article/Wonder-Woman-would-approve-Lasso-of-Truth-5270112.php|title='Lasso of Truth' review: Wonder Woman and a 3-way|accessdate=June 25, 2014|work=SFGate|date=March 1, 2014|first=Robert |last=Hurwitt}}</ref>\n*''Behind the Eye'' from ''City Beat Cincinnati'': According to Carson Kreitzer's new script, Behind the Eye, premiering at the Cincinnati Playhouse, Lee Miller 'reflects light so well it seems that she herself is the source.' Miller, you see, is a forgotten but real historical figure, a photographer's model in Vogue in the 1920s, a photographer herself in the 1930s and a fearless photojournalist across Europe during World War II. By any standards she was promiscuous and willful, a free spirit for whom happiness was just beyond her grasp. She is the fascinating focal point for Kreitzer's compelling new play [...], perhaps the best piece of theater at the Playhouse this season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://citybeat.com/cincinnati/article-23063-behind-the-eye-(review).html|title=Behind the Eye (Review)|accessdate=June 25, 2014|first=Rick|last=Pender|date=April 11, 2011|work=CityBeat|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140707155448/http://citybeat.com/cincinnati/article-23063-behind-the-eye-(review).html|archive-date=July 7, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n*''1:23'' from Atlanta's ''Creative Loafing'': Playwright Carson Kreitzer's drama draws on elements of police procedurals like Law & Order in its investigation of the crimes of Susan Smith and two other notorious mothers who killed their children. In 1:23, we know whodunit, so the more pressing question becomes, 'Why did they do it?' Kreitzer's script finds clues in official records, urban legends and Latin-American folklore, placing the killings in complex, almost baffling cultural and psychological contexts. [...] Few themes prove as big or challenging as the ones raised in 1:23. If anything, the play's ambition nearly overleaps itself in its attempt to address too many ideas in too limited a time. 1:23 serves as a harrowing thematic symphony that can be overly pretentious and opaque, yet also builds to some genuine revelations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://clatl.com/atlanta/synchronicitys-123-medea-blitz/Content?oid=1279465|title=Synchronicity's 1:23 Medea blitz |accessdate=June 25, 2014|publisher=Creative Loafing Atlanta|date=April 20, 2009|first=Curt |last=Holman}}</ref>\n*''Valerie Shoots Andy'' from ''[[The New York Times]]'': Ms. Kreitzer offers an assessment of how Solanas's play (''Up Your Ass'') and a diatribe she wrote shortly before the shooting called the SCUM manifesto evolved into gunshots. It is a bleak but fascinating piece that plays with Warhol's notions of repetition, returning to the shooting and its immediate aftermath again and again as it fleshes out the portrait of Solanas, who died in 1988.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/03/01/theater/theater-review-writer-one-day-would-be-killer-next-reliving-warhol-shooting.html|title=Theater Review \u2014 A Writer One Day, a Would-Be Killer the Next: Reliving the Warhol Shooting|accessdate=June 25, 2014|work=[[The New York Times]]|date= March 1, 2001|first=Neil |last=Genzlinger}}</ref>\n\n== In Development ==\n\n* ''Runway 69'' a new musical, \"a provocative story of one of the raunchiest strip clubs in mid-1990\u2019s Times Square, and the lives of the men and women who work there.\" <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.erinkamler.net/musicals/runway-69/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20140625155856/http://www.erinkamler.net/musicals/runway-69/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=June 25, 2014 |title=Runway 69 |accessdate=June 25, 2014 |publisher=Erin Kamler }}</ref> Workshopped at the 2013 The Ground Floor<ref>{{cite web|url=http://berkeleyrep.org/groundfloor/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140505020903/http://berkeleyrep.org/groundfloor/|url-status=dead|archive-date=5 May 2014|title=The Ground Floor at Berkeley Rep|date=5 May 2014}}</ref> summer residency lab at [[Berkeley Rep]].
