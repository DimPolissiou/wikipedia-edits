Sutlers served troops at Army camps as far back as the [[French and Indian War|French and Indian]] and [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary]] wars.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Habgood |first1=Carol |last2=Skaer |first2=Marcia |page=1 |date=October 1994 |title=One Hundred Years of Service: A History of the Army & Air Force Exchange Service |url=http://www.aafes.com/Images/History/Exchange100YearHistoryBook.pdf |publisher=Army & Air Force Exchange Service |isbn=9995489228}}</ref>\n\nComplaints of sutlers charging premiums for substandard merchandise were widespread during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], and in 1867 the War Department created the post trader system. While intended to prevent the unscrupulous practices of sutlers, the post trader system still subjected troops to over-inflated prices and was rife with bribery and corruption.<ref>{{cite journal |date=September\u2013October 1966 |title=Post Exchange System |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gWafisFNex8C&pg=PT254&lpg=PT254&dq=%22abuses%22&source=bl&ots=RSQqZRf_A7&sig=ICLNUtqr3ISJCRV25AAZYlHoySM&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwihiuCfqY_WAhVGWCYKHfcjCpgQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&q=%22abuses%22&f=false |journal=JAG Law Review |volume=VIII |issue=5 |page=21 |access-date=5 September 2017 }}</ref>\n\nOn 29 November 1880, Col. Henry A. Morrow, seeking to quell disciplinary problems resulting from troops visiting disreputable places of amusement in nearby towns, established the first American military canteen at [[Vancouver Barracks]]. There, troops were provided newspapers and magazines, played billiards and cards, and could obtain light food and drink without leaving post.\n\nThe idea was so successful that other posts began establishing canteens across the frontier, providing troops with not only a place to socialize but obtain daily necessities at affordable prices. In 1889, the War Department issued General Orders No. 10, authorizing commanding generals to establish canteens at army posts. Like the modern-day exchange system, these canteens were largely financially self-sustaining.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Habgood |first1=Carol |last2=Skaer |first2=Marcia |pages=9\u201312 |date=October 1994 |title=One Hundred Years of Service: A History of the Army & Air Force Exchange Service |url=http://www.aafes.com/Images/History/Exchange100YearHistoryBook.pdf |publisher=Army & Air Force Exchange Service |isbn=9995489228}}</ref>\n\nIn February 1882, the secretary of war ordered that canteens be henceforth referred to as \"post exchanges.\" This change was due to the popular association of the word \"canteen\" with the bawdy, immoral behavior alleged to occur in the canteens of foreign armies. By 1895, post traders had been almost entirely replaced on Army posts by post exchanges.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Habgood |first1=Carol |last2=Skaer |first2=Marcia |pages=16\u201318 |date=October 1994 |title=One Hundred Years of Service: A History of the Army & Air Force Exchange Service |url=http://www.aafes.com/Images/History/Exchange100YearHistoryBook.pdf |publisher=Army & Air Force Exchange Service |isbn=9995489228}}</ref>\n\n===Early developments===\n\nOn 25 July 1895, the War Department issued General Orders No. 46, directing commanders at every post to establish a post exchange \"wherever practicable.\" Post exchanges served two missions: first, \"to supply the troops at reasonable prices with the articles of ordinary use, wear, and consumption, not supplied by the Government, and to afford them a means of rational recreation and amusement,\" and second, \"provide the means for improving the masses\" through exchange profits.<ref>{{cite journal |date=September\u2013October 1966 |title=Post Exchange System |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gWafisFNex8C&pg=PT256&lpg=PT256&dq=%22general+orders+46%22&f=false#v=onepage&q=%22general%20orders%2046%22&f=false |journal=JAG Law Review |volume=VIII |issue=5 |page=33 |access-date=5 September 2017 }}</ref>\n\nFor the first 45 years of the exchange system, exchanges operated independently under the direction of each post\u2019s [[commanding officer]], meaning there was little uniformity between exchange locations. While the War Department did not centrally control exchange operations, it did hold commanding officers accountable for their financial assets. Exchanges were also subject to annual checks by the Inspector General\u2019s office.\n\nWith the outbreak of [[World War I]] and subsequent expansion of the U.S. Army, it became clear that the existing post exchange system was not equipped to accommodate such a large-scale effort. Gen. [[John J. Pershing]] enlisted the help of civilian service organizations to provide canteen service overseas, though they proved to lack the equipment and experience necessary to fully meet the needs of downrange troops.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Habgood |first1=Carol |last2=Skaer |first2=Marcia |pages=19\u201321 |date=October 1994 |title=One Hundred Years of Service: A History of the Army & Air Force Exchange Service |url=http://www.aafes.com/Images/History/Exchange100YearHistoryBook.pdf |publisher=Army & Air Force Exchange Service |isbn=9995489228}}</ref>\n\n===Centralization===\n\nDuring the mobilization efforts leading up to [[World War II]], the War Department increasingly looked for ways to upgrade its antiquated post exchange system. After completing a review of existing exchanges, Lt. Col. J. Edwin Grose concluded that the Army would need to \"become the operator of an extensive chain store system with world wide [sic] branches\" to sufficiently meet the demands of a large-scale war effort. In April 1941, an advisory committee of five prominent retail executives affirmed this notion, recommending the creation of a central organization to oversee exchange operations.\n\nOn 6 June 1941, the Army Exchange Service (AES) was created.<ref>{{cite journal |date=September\u2013October 1966 |title=Post Exchange System |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gWafisFNex8C&pg=PT254&lpg=PT254&dq=#v=onepage&q=%22army%20exchange%20service%22&f=false |journal=JAG Law Review |volume=VIII |issue=5 |page=34 |access-date=5 September 2017 }}</ref> On 26 July 1948, AES was renamed the Army & Air Force Exchange Service, to reflect AES\u2019 responsibility to serve the [[United States Air Force|Air Force]], which was created in 1947.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Habgood |first1=Carol |last2=Skaer |first2=Marcia |page=39 |date=October 1994 |title=One Hundred Years of Service: A History of the Army & Air Force Exchange Service |url=http://www.aafes.com/Images/History/Exchange100YearHistoryBook.pdf |publisher=Army & Air Force Exchange Service |isbn=9995489228}}</ref>\n\nSince its establishment, the Exchange has been involved in 14 major military operations (to include World War II, Korea, Vietnam, Grenada, Panama, the Balkans and Operations Enduring and Iraqi Freedom) as well as several dozen humanitarian and disaster relief contingencies.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Civilian leadership===\n[[File:Tom Shull Headshot 2017 .jpg|alt=|thumb|Tom Shull, Director/CEO of the Army & Air Force Exchange Service]]\nIn 2012, [[Tom Shull]] became the Exchange's first civilian director/CEO, having previously served as an executive with Wise Foods, Inc., Hanover Direct, Inc., Barneys New York and Meridian Ventures.

While intended to prevent the unscrupulous practices of sutlers, the post trader system still subjected troops to over-inflated prices and was rife with bribery and corruption.<ref>{{cite journal |date=September\u2013October 1966 |title=Post Exchange System |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gWafisFNex8C&pg=PT254&lpg=PT254&dq=%22abuses%22&source=bl&ots=RSQqZRf_A7&sig=ICLNUtqr3ISJCRV25AAZYlHoySM&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwihiuCfqY_WAhVGWCYKHfcjCpgQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&q=%22abuses%22&f=false |journal=JAG Law Review |volume=VIII |issue=5 |page=21 |access-date=5 September 2017 }}</ref>\n\nOn 29 November 1880, Col. Henry A. Morrow, seeking to quell disciplinary problems resulting from troops visiting disreputable places of amusement in nearby towns, established the first American military canteen at [[Vancouver Barracks]]. There, troops were provided newspapers and magazines, played billiards and cards, and could obtain light food and drink without leaving post.\n\nThe idea was so successful that other posts began establishing canteens across the frontier, providing troops with not only a place to socialize but obtain daily necessities at affordable prices. In 1889, the War Department issued General Orders No. 10, authorizing commanding generals to establish canteens at army posts. Like the modern-day exchange system, these canteens were largely financially self-sustaining.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Habgood |first1=Carol |last2=Skaer |first2=Marcia |pages=9\u201312 |date=October 1994 |title=One Hundred Years of Service: A History of the Army & Air Force Exchange Service |url=http://www.aafes.com/Images/History/Exchange100YearHistoryBook.pdf |publisher=Army & Air Force Exchange Service |isbn=9995489228}}</ref>\n\nIn February 1882, the secretary of war ordered that canteens be henceforth referred to as \"post exchanges.\" This change was due to the popular association of the word \"canteen\" with the bawdy, immoral behavior alleged to occur in the canteens of foreign armies. By 1895, post traders had been almost entirely replaced on Army posts by post exchanges.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Habgood |first1=Carol |last2=Skaer |first2=Marcia |pages=16\u201318 |date=October 1994 |title=One Hundred Years of Service: A History of the Army & Air Force Exchange Service |url=http://www.aafes.com/Images/History/Exchange100YearHistoryBook.pdf |publisher=Army & Air Force Exchange Service |isbn=9995489228}}</ref>\n\n===Early developments===\n\nOn 25 July 1895, the War Department issued General Orders No. 46, directing commanders at every post to establish a post exchange \"wherever practicable.\" Post exchanges served two missions: first, \"to supply the troops at reasonable prices with the articles of ordinary use, wear, and consumption, not supplied by the Government, and to afford them a means of rational recreation and amusement,\" and second, \"provide the means for improving the masses\" through exchange profits.<ref>{{cite journal |date=September\u2013October 1966 |title=Post Exchange System |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gWafisFNex8C&pg=PT256&lpg=PT256&dq=%22general+orders+46%22&f=false#v=onepage&q=%22general%20orders%2046%22&f=false |journal=JAG Law Review |volume=VIII |issue=5 |page=33 |access-date=5 September 2017 }}</ref>\n\nFor the first 45 years of the exchange system, exchanges operated independently under the direction of each post\u2019s [[commanding officer]], meaning there was little uniformity between exchange locations. While the War Department did not centrally control exchange operations, it did hold commanding officers accountable for their financial assets. Exchanges were also subject to annual checks by the Inspector General\u2019s office.\n\nWith the outbreak of [[World War I]] and subsequent expansion of the U.S. Army, it became clear that the existing post exchange system was not equipped to accommodate such a large-scale effort. Gen. [[John J. Pershing]] enlisted the help of civilian service organizations to provide canteen service overseas, though they proved to lack the equipment and experience necessary to fully meet the needs of downrange troops.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Habgood |first1=Carol |last2=Skaer |first2=Marcia |pages=19\u201321 |date=October 1994 |title=One Hundred Years of Service: A History of the Army & Air Force Exchange Service |url=http://www.aafes.com/Images/History/Exchange100YearHistoryBook.pdf |publisher=Army & Air Force Exchange Service |isbn=9995489228}}</ref>\n\n===Centralization===\n\nDuring the mobilization efforts leading up to [[World War II]], the War Department increasingly looked for ways to upgrade its antiquated post exchange system. After completing a review of existing exchanges, Lt. Col. J. Edwin Grose concluded that the Army would need to \"become the operator of an extensive chain store system with world wide [sic] branches\" to sufficiently meet the demands of a large-scale war effort. In April 1941, an advisory committee of five prominent retail executives affirmed this notion, recommending the creation of a central organization to oversee exchange operations.\n\nOn 6 June 1941, the Army Exchange Service (AES) was created.<ref>{{cite journal |date=September\u2013October 1966 |title=Post Exchange System |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gWafisFNex8C&pg=PT254&lpg=PT254&dq=#v=onepage&q=%22army%20exchange%20service%22&f=false |journal=JAG Law Review |volume=VIII |issue=5 |page=34 |access-date=5 September 2017 }}</ref> On 26 July 1948, AES was renamed the Army & Air Force Exchange Service, to reflect AES\u2019 responsibility to serve the [[United States Air Force|Air Force]], which was created in 1947.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Habgood |first1=Carol |last2=Skaer |first2=Marcia |page=39 |date=October 1994 |title=One Hundred Years of Service: A History of the Army & Air Force Exchange Service |url=http://www.aafes.com/Images/History/Exchange100YearHistoryBook.pdf |publisher=Army & Air Force Exchange Service |isbn=9995489228}}</ref>\n\nSince its establishment, the Exchange has been involved in 14 major military operations (to include World War II, Korea, Vietnam, Grenada, Panama, the Balkans and Operations Enduring and Iraqi Freedom) as well as several dozen humanitarian and disaster relief contingencies.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Civilian leadership===\n[[File:Tom Shull Headshot 2017 .jpg|alt=|thumb|Tom Shull, Director/CEO of the Army & Air Force Exchange Service]]\nIn 2012, [[Tom Shull]] became the Exchange's first civilian director/CEO, having previously served as an executive with Wise Foods, Inc., Hanover Direct, Inc., Barneys New York and Meridian Ventures.

London: [[George Newnes]], 1961, Vol.&nbsp;1, p.&nbsp;497.</ref> but the derivation of this name is uncertain. The traditional etymology is from the verb ''aperire'', \"to open\", in allusion to its being the season when trees and flowers begin to \"open\", which is supported by comparison with the modern Greek use of [[wikt:\u03ac\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9\u03be\u03b7#Greek|\u03ac\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9\u03be\u03b7]] (''\u00e1nixi'') (opening) for spring. Since some of the Roman months were named in honor of divinities, and as April was sacred to the goddess [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]], her [[Veneralia]] being held on the first day, it has been suggested that Aprilis was originally her month '''Aphrilis''', from her equivalent Greek goddess name [[Aphrodite]] (''Aphros''), or from the [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]] name ''[[Aphrodite|Apru]]''. [[Jacob Grimm]] suggests the name of a hypothetical god or hero, ''Aper'' or ''Aprus''.<ref>Jacob Grim ''Geschichte der deutschen Sprache''. Cap. \"Monate\"</ref>\n\nApril was the second month of the earliest [[Roman calendar]],<ref name=\"Chisholm1911\"/> before ''[[Ianuarius]]'' and ''[[Februarius]]'' were added by King [[Numa Pompilius]] about 700&nbsp;BC. It became the fourth month of the calendar year (the year when twelve months are displayed in order) during the time of the [[decemvirs]] about 450&nbsp;BC, when it also was given 29&nbsp;days. The 30th day was added during the reform of the calendar undertaken by [[Julius Caesar]] in the mid-40s&nbsp;BC, which produced the Julian calendar.\n\nThe [[Anglo-Saxons]] called April ''\u0113astre-mona\u00fe''. The [[Venerable Bede]] says in ''[[The Reckoning of Time]]'' that this month ''\u0113astre'' is the root of the word [[Easter]]. He further states that the month was named after a goddess ''[[Eostre]]'' whose feast was in that month. It is also attested by [[Einhard]] in his work, [[Vita Karoli Magni]].\n\n[[St George]]'s day is the twenty-third of the month; and [[St Mark]]'s Eve, with its superstition that the ghosts of those who are doomed to die within the year will be seen to pass into the church, falls on the twenty-fourth.<ref name=\"Chisholm1911\">{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=April|volume=2|page=230}}</ref>\n\nIn [[History of China|China]] the symbolic ploughing of the earth by the emperor and princes of the blood took place in their third month, which frequently corresponds to April.<ref name=\"Chisholm1911\"/> In Finnish April is ''huhtikuu'', meaning ''[[slash-and-burn]] moon'', when [[gymnosperm]]s for beat and burn clearing of farmland were felled.\n\nIn [[Slovene language|Slovene]], the most established traditional name is ''mali traven'', meaning the month when plants start growing. It was first written in 1466 in the [[\u0160kofja Loka manuscript]].<ref name=\"KoledarDPG2007\">{{cite journal|url=http://www.dobrova-polhovgradec.si/doc/priponke/koledar%20prir%2007%20zadnji.pdf |title=Koledar prireditev v letu 2007 in druge informacije ob\u010dine Dobrova\u2013Polhov Gradec |language=Slovenian |trans-title=The Calendar of Events and Other Information of the Municipality of Dobrova\u2013Polhov Gradec <!-- |issn=C505-5857 --> |publisher=Municipality of Dobrova-Polhov Gradec |year=2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102060918/http://www.dobrova-polhovgradec.si/doc/priponke/koledar%20prir%2007%20zadnji.pdf |archivedate=November 2, 2013 }}</ref>\n\nThe month Aprilis had 30&nbsp;days; [[Numa Pompilius]] made it 29&nbsp;days long; finally [[Julius Caesar]]\u2019s calendar reform made it again 30&nbsp;days long, which was not changed in the calendar revision of [[Julian calendar|Augustus Caesar]] in 8&nbsp;BC. Additionally in the Spanish colony, Las Islas Filipinas (now known as the Philippines), the month Aprilis had a significant meaning to the life of the natives as it was associated to the influence of the Chinese during the Spanish colonial period. The importance of this aspect to the lives of the natives was formerly associated to an event called \"Abril na Ikaw\" as it is closely linked to the famous trader, April Yu.\n\nIn [[Ancient Rome]], the festival of [[Cerealia]] was held for seven days from mid-to-late April, but exact dates are uncertain. [[Feriae Latinae]] was also held in April, with the date varying. Other ancient Roman observances include [[Veneralia]] (April 1), [[Megalesia]] (April 10\u201316), [[Fordicidia]] (April 15), [[Parilia]] (April 21), [[Vinalia|Vinalia Urbana]], [[Robigalia]], and [[Serapia]] were celebrated on (April 25). [[Floralia]] was held April 27 during the [[Roman Republic|Republican era]], or April 28 on the [[Julian calendar]], and lasted until May 3. However, these dates do not correspond to the modern [[Gregorian calendar]].\n\nThe [[Lyrids]] [[meteor shower]] appears on April 16 \u2013 April 26 each year, with the peak generally occurring on April 22. [[Eta Aquariids]] meteor shower also appears in April. It is visible from about April 21 to about May 20 each year with peak activity on or around May 6. The [[Pi Puppids]] appear on April 23, but only in years around the parent comet's [[perihelion]] date. The [[Virginids]] also shower at various dates in April.\n\nThe \"Days of April\" (''journ\u00e9es d'avril'') is a name appropriated in French history to a [[July Monarchy#April 1834 insurrections|series of insurrections]] at Lyons, Paris and elsewhere, against the government of [[Louis-Philippe of France|Louis Philippe]] in 1834, which led to violent repressive measures, and to a famous trial known as the ''proc\u00e8s d'avril''.<ref name=\"Chisholm1911\"/>\n\n==April symbols==\n*[[File:Irish diamond.JPG|alt=Diamond crystals|thumb|[[Diamond]] crystals]][[File:Diamond.jpg|alt=Faceted diamond|thumb|Faceted diamond]]April's [[Birthstones|birthstone]] is the [[diamond (gemstone)|diamond]].\n*[[File:Daisy ntgr.JPG|alt=Daisy flower|thumb|[[Bellis perennis|Daisy]] flower]][[File:Sweet Pea (27711557850).jpg|alt=Sweet pea|thumb|[[Sweet pea]]]]The [[Birthday#Birth flowers|birth flower]] is typically listed as either the [[Common Daisy|Daisy]] ''(Bellis perennis)'' or the [[Sweet pea|Sweet Pea]].<ref>Kipfer, Barbara Ann (1997) ''The Order of Things.''

London: [[George Newnes]], 1961, Vol.&nbsp;1, p.&nbsp;497.</ref> but the derivation of this name is uncertain. The traditional etymology is from the verb ''aperire'', \"to open\", in allusion to its being the season when trees and flowers begin to \"open\", which is supported by comparison with the modern Greek use of [[wikt:\u03ac\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9\u03be\u03b7#Greek|\u03ac\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9\u03be\u03b7]] (''\u00e1nixi'') (opening) for spring. Since some of the Roman months were named in honor of divinities, and as April was sacred to the goddess [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]], her [[Veneralia]] being held on the first day, it has been suggested that Aprilis was originally her month '''Aphrilis''', from her equivalent Greek goddess name [[Aphrodite]] (''Aphros''), or from the [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]] name ''[[Aphrodite|Apru]]''. [[Jacob Grimm]] suggests the name of a hypothetical god or hero, ''Aper'' or ''Aprus''.<ref>Jacob Grim ''Geschichte der deutschen Sprache''. Cap. \"Monate\"</ref>\n\nApril was the second month of the earliest [[Roman calendar]],<ref name=\"Chisholm1911\"/> before ''[[Ianuarius]]'' and ''[[Februarius]]'' were added by King [[Numa Pompilius]] about 700&nbsp;BC. It became the fourth month of the calendar year (the year when twelve months are displayed in order) during the time of the [[decemvirs]] about 450&nbsp;BC, when it also was given 29&nbsp;days. The 30th day was added during the reform of the calendar undertaken by [[Julius Caesar]] in the mid-40s&nbsp;BC, which produced the Julian calendar.\n\nThe [[Anglo-Saxons]] called April ''\u0113astre-mona\u00fe''. The [[Venerable Bede]] says in ''[[The Reckoning of Time]]'' that this month ''\u0113astre'' is the root of the word [[Easter]]. He further states that the month was named after a goddess ''[[Eostre]]'' whose feast was in that month. It is also attested by [[Einhard]] in his work, [[Vita Karoli Magni]].\n\n[[St George]]'s day is the twenty-third of the month; and [[St Mark]]'s Eve, with its superstition that the ghosts of those who are doomed to die within the year will be seen to pass into the church, falls on the twenty-fourth.<ref name=\"Chisholm1911\">{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=April|volume=2|page=230}}</ref>\n\nIn [[History of China|China]] the symbolic ploughing of the earth by the emperor and princes of the blood took place in their third month, which frequently corresponds to April.<ref name=\"Chisholm1911\"/> In Finnish April is ''huhtikuu'', meaning ''[[slash-and-burn]] moon'', when [[gymnosperm]]s for beat and burn clearing of farmland were felled.\n\nIn [[Slovene language|Slovene]], the most established traditional name is ''mali traven'', meaning the month when plants start growing. It was first written in 1466 in the [[\u0160kofja Loka manuscript]].<ref name=\"KoledarDPG2007\">{{cite journal|url=http://www.dobrova-polhovgradec.si/doc/priponke/koledar%20prir%2007%20zadnji.pdf |title=Koledar prireditev v letu 2007 in druge informacije ob\u010dine Dobrova\u2013Polhov Gradec |language=Slovenian |trans-title=The Calendar of Events and Other Information of the Municipality of Dobrova\u2013Polhov Gradec <!-- |issn=C505-5857 --> |publisher=Municipality of Dobrova-Polhov Gradec |year=2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102060918/http://www.dobrova-polhovgradec.si/doc/priponke/koledar%20prir%2007%20zadnji.pdf |archivedate=November 2, 2013 }}</ref>\n\nThe month Aprilis had 30&nbsp;days; [[Numa Pompilius]] made it 29&nbsp;days long; finally [[Julius Caesar]]\u2019s calendar reform made it again 30&nbsp;days long, which was not changed in the calendar revision of [[Julian calendar|Augustus Caesar]] in 8&nbsp;BC. Additionally in the Spanish colony, Las Islas Filipinas (now known as the Philippines), the month Aprilis had a significant meaning to the life of the natives as it was associated to the influence of the Chinese during the Spanish colonial period. The importance of this aspect to the lives of the natives was formerly associated to an event called \"Abril na Ikaw\" as it is closely linked to the famous trader, April Yu.\n\nIn [[Ancient Rome]], the festival of [[Cerealia]] was held for seven days from mid-to-late April, but exact dates are uncertain. [[Feriae Latinae]] was also held in April, with the date varying. Other ancient Roman observances include [[Veneralia]] (April 1), [[Megalesia]] (April 10\u201316), [[Fordicidia]] (April 15), [[Parilia]] (April 21), [[Vinalia|Vinalia Urbana]], [[Robigalia]], and [[Serapia]] were celebrated on (April 25). [[Floralia]] was held April 27 during the [[Roman Republic|Republican era]], or April 28 on the [[Julian calendar]], and lasted until May 3. However, these dates do not correspond to the modern [[Gregorian calendar]].\n\nThe [[Lyrids]] [[meteor shower]] appears on April 16 \u2013 April 26 each year, with the peak generally occurring on April 22. [[Eta Aquariids]] meteor shower also appears in April. It is visible from about April 21 to about May 20 each year with peak activity on or around May 6. The [[Pi Puppids]] appear on April 23, but only in years around the parent comet's [[perihelion]] date. The [[Virginids]] also shower at various dates in April.\n\nThe \"Days of April\" (''journ\u00e9es d'avril'') is a name appropriated in French history to a [[July Monarchy#April 1834 insurrections|series of insurrections]] at Lyons, Paris and elsewhere, against the government of [[Louis-Philippe of France|Louis Philippe]] in 1834, which led to violent repressive measures, and to a famous trial known as the ''proc\u00e8s d'avril''.<ref name=\"Chisholm1911\"/>\n\n==April symbols==\n*[[File:Irish diamond.JPG|alt=Diamond crystals|thumb|[[Diamond]] crystals]][[File:Diamond.jpg|alt=Faceted diamond|thumb|Faceted diamond]]April's [[Birthstones|birthstone]] is the [[diamond (gemstone)|diamond]].\n*[[File:Daisy ntgr.JPG|alt=Daisy flower|thumb|[[Bellis perennis|Daisy]] flower]][[File:Sweet Pea (27711557850).jpg|alt=Sweet pea|thumb|[[Sweet pea]]]]The [[Birthday#Birth flowers|birth flower]] is typically listed as either the [[Common Daisy|Daisy]] ''(Bellis perennis)'' or the [[Sweet pea|Sweet Pea]].<ref>Kipfer, Barbara Ann (1997) ''The Order of Things.''
