Two potential overall strategies outlined were: mitigation, in which the aim is to reduce the health impact of the epidemic but not to stop transmission completely; and suppression, where the aim is to reduce transmission rates to a point where case numbers fall. Until this point government actions had been based on a strategy of mitigation, but the modelling predicted that while this would reduce deaths by approximately 2/3, it would still lead to approximately 250,000 deaths from the disease and the health systems becoming overwhelmed.<ref name=\"Imperial16March2020\" /> On the same day as the report was released, the Prime Minister announced in a press conference significant changes to the government advice, extending self isolation to whole households, advising social distancing particularly for vulnerable groups, and indicating that further measures were likely to be required in the future.<ref name=avoid/><ref name=\"Independent200317\" /> A March 30 paper by Imperial estimates that the lockdown will reduced the number of dead from 510,000 to less than 20,000.<ref>[https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/sph/ide/gida-fellowships/Imperial-College-COVID19-Europe-estimates-and-NPI-impact-30-03-2020.pdf COVID19 Europe estimates and NPI impact] Neil Ferguson, Imperial College London</ref>\n\n==Response by sector==\n=== Government ===\n[[File:British Government NHS coronavirus public info poster.pdf|thumb|upright|English NHS coronavirus poster, February 2020<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.england.nhs.uk/london/2020/02/03/coronavirus-public-information-campaign-launched-across-the-uk/ |title=Coronavirus public information campaign launched across the UK |work=NHS England |date=3 February 2020 |accessdate=7 March 2020}}</ref>]]\nGuidance has altered in line with the number of cases detected and changes in where affected people have contracted the virus, as well as with what has been happening in other countries.<ref name=\"Bosley26Feb2020\"/> In February, [[Chief Medical Officer (United Kingdom)|Chief Medical Adviser]] to the UK Government, [[Chris Whitty]] explained \"we basically have a strategy which depends upon four tactical aims: the first one is to contain;

While his unit was retreating to the Pusan Perimeter, Corporal Rubin was assigned to stay behind to keep open the vital Taegu-Pusan Road link used by his withdrawing unit. During the ensuing battle, overwhelming numbers of North Korean troops assaulted a hill defended solely by Corporal Rubin.  He inflicted a staggering number of casualties on the attacking force during his personal 24-hour battle, single-handedly slowing the enemy advance and allowing the 8th Cavalry Regiment to complete its withdrawal successfully. Following the breakout from the Pusan Perimeter, the 8th Cavalry Regiment proceeded northward and advanced into North Korea. During the advance, he helped capture several hundred North Korean soldiers. On October 30, 1950, Chinese forces attacked his unit at [[Unsan]], North Korea, during a massive nighttime assault. That night and throughout the next day, he manned a .30 caliber machine gun at the south end of the unit's line after three previous gunners became casualties. He continued to man his machine gun until his ammunition was exhausted. His determined stand slowed the pace of the enemy advance in his sector, permitting the remnants of his unit to retreat southward. As the battle raged, Corporal Rubin was severely wounded and captured by the Chinese. Choosing to remain in the prison camp despite offers from the Chinese to return him to his native Hungary, Corporal Rubin disregarded his own personal safety and immediately began sneaking out of the camp at night in search of food for his comrades. Breaking into enemy food storehouses and gardens, he risked certain torture or death if caught. Corporal Rubin provided not only food to the starving Soldiers, but also desperately needed medical care and moral support for the sick and wounded of the POW camp. His brave, selfless efforts were directly attributed to saving the lives of as many as forty of his fellow prisoners. Corporal Rubin's gallant actions in close contact with the enemy and unyielding courage and bravery while a prisoner of war are in the highest traditions of military service and reflect great credit upon himself and the United States Army.<ref name=AMOHW>{{cite web\n|accessdate=2014-12-05\n|url = http://www.history.army.mil/html/moh/koreanwar.html#RUBIN\n|title = Medal of Honor Recipients \u2013 Korean War: Tibor Rubin\n|publisher= [[United States Army Center of Military History]]}}</ref>}}\n\n==Later life and death==\nAfter his military service, he worked in his brother's Long Beach liquor store.<ref name=LATimes/> Rubin was a resident of [[Garden Grove, California]].<ref name=OCR>{{cite news\n | date= October 18, 2005\n | title= Medal of Honor recipient just did duty\n | author= Nguyen Huy Vu\n | url= http://www.ocregister.com/news/medal-207819-honor-rubin.html\n | publisher= [[Orange County Register]]\n | accessdate= December 12, 2014\n | quote= Mr. Rubin recommends not harboring hatred even with all his suffering and loss: \"If you feel hate for your fellow man ... you'll only hurt yourself...\"\n}}</ref>\n\nHe regularly volunteered at the Long Beach Veterans Hospital; having earned an award for more than 20,000 hours of volunteer work.

The survivors of the prison war camp credited Rubin with keeping them alive and saving at least 40 American soldiers.<ref name=army.mil />\n\nRubin refused his captors' repeated offers of repatriation to Hungary, by then behind the [[Iron Curtain]].\n\n==Awards and Decorations==\n<center>\n{|\n|-\n|colspan=\"4\" align=\"center\"|[[File:Combat Infantry Badge.svg|200px]]\n|-\n|colspan=\"4\" align=\"center\" |{{Ribbon devices|number=|type=oak|ribbon=Medal_of_Honor_ribbon.svg|width=110}} {{Ribbon devices|number=1|type=oak|other_device=|ribbon=Purple Heart ribbon.svg|width=110}}\n|-\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=|type=oak|other_device=|ribbon=Prisoner_of_War_Medal_ribbon.svg|width=110}}\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=service-star|ribbon=Army_of_Occupation_ribbon.svg|width=110}}\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=|type=service-star|ribbon=National Defense Service Medal ribbon.svg|width=110}}\n|-\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=4|type=service-star|ribbon=Korean_Service_Medal_-_Ribbon.svg|width=110}}\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=|type=award-star|other_device=|ribbon=United Nations Service Medal Korea ribbon.svg|width=110}}\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=|type=award-star|other_device=|ribbon=Republic of Korea War Service Medal ribbon.svg|width=110}}\n|-\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|colspan=\"12\" align=\"center\" | [[Combat Infantryman Badge]]\n|-\n|colspan=\"6\" align=\"center\"| [[Medal of Honor]]\n|colspan=\"6\" align=\"center\"| [[Purple Heart]]<br>w/ 1 bronze [[oak leaf cluster]]\n|-\n|colspan=\"4\" align=\"center\"| [[Prisoner of War Medal]]\n|colspan=\"4\" align=\"center\"| [[Army of Occupation Medal]]<br>w/ 'Japan' clasp \n|colspan=\"4\" align=\"center\"| [[National Defense Service Medal]] \n|-\n|colspan=\"4\" align=\"center\"| [[Korean Service Medal]]<br>w/ 4 bronze [[campaign star]]s\n|colspan=\"4\" align=\"center\"| [[United Nations Korea Medal]]\n|colspan=\"4\" align=\"center\"| [[Korean War Service Medal]]\n|-\n|}\n</center>\n\n<center>\n{|\n|-\n|colspan=\"4\" align=\"center\" |{{Ribbon devices|number=|type=oak|ribbon=Korean_Presidential_Unit_Citation.png|width=110}}\n|-\n|}\n</center>\n\n<center>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|colspan=\"12\" align=\"center\" | [[Republic of Korea Presidential Unit Citation]]<br>(Army Version)\n|-\n|}\n</center>\n\n===Medal of Honor===\nIn 1993, a study was commissioned by the United States Army to investigate racial discrimination in the awarding of medals.

While his unit was retreating to the Pusan Perimeter, Corporal Rubin was assigned to stay behind to keep open the vital Taegu-Pusan Road link used by his withdrawing unit. During the ensuing battle, overwhelming numbers of North Korean troops assaulted a hill defended solely by Corporal Rubin.  He inflicted a staggering number of casualties on the attacking force during his personal 24-hour battle, single-handedly slowing the enemy advance and allowing the 8th Cavalry Regiment to complete its withdrawal successfully. Following the breakout from the Pusan Perimeter, the 8th Cavalry Regiment proceeded northward and advanced into North Korea. During the advance, he helped capture several hundred North Korean soldiers. On October 30, 1950, Chinese forces attacked his unit at [[Unsan]], North Korea, during a massive nighttime assault. That night and throughout the next day, he manned a .30 caliber machine gun at the south end of the unit's line after three previous gunners became casualties. He continued to man his machine gun until his ammunition was exhausted. His determined stand slowed the pace of the enemy advance in his sector, permitting the remnants of his unit to retreat southward. As the battle raged, Corporal Rubin was severely wounded and captured by the Chinese. Choosing to remain in the prison camp despite offers from the Chinese to return him to his native Hungary, Corporal Rubin disregarded his own personal safety and immediately began sneaking out of the camp at night in search of food for his comrades. Breaking into enemy food storehouses and gardens, he risked certain torture or death if caught. Corporal Rubin provided not only food to the starving Soldiers, but also desperately needed medical care and moral support for the sick and wounded of the POW camp. His brave, selfless efforts were directly attributed to saving the lives of as many as forty of his fellow prisoners. Corporal Rubin's gallant actions in close contact with the enemy and unyielding courage and bravery while a prisoner of war are in the highest traditions of military service and reflect great credit upon himself and the United States Army.<ref name=AMOHW>{{cite web\n|accessdate=2014-12-05\n|url = http://www.history.army.mil/html/moh/koreanwar.html#RUBIN\n|title = Medal of Honor Recipients \u2013 Korean War: Tibor Rubin\n|publisher= [[United States Army Center of Military History]]}}</ref>}}\n\n==Later life and death==\nAfter his military service, he worked in his brother's Long Beach liquor store.<ref name=LATimes/> Rubin was a resident of [[Garden Grove, California]].<ref name=OCR>{{cite news\n | date= October 18, 2005\n | title= Medal of Honor recipient just did duty\n | author= Nguyen Huy Vu\n | url= http://www.ocregister.com/news/medal-207819-honor-rubin.html\n | publisher= [[Orange County Register]]\n | accessdate= December 12, 2014\n | quote= Mr. Rubin recommends not harboring hatred even with all his suffering and loss: \"If you feel hate for your fellow man ... you'll only hurt yourself...\"\n}}</ref>\n\nHe regularly volunteered at the Long Beach Veterans Hospital; having earned an award for more than 20,000 hours of volunteer work.

It was their first to feature drummer/vocalist [[Phil Collins]] and guitarist [[Steve Hackett]]. The album received a mixed response from critics and was not initially a commercial success; it did not enter the UK chart until 1974, when it reached its peak at No. 39. However, the album was successful in Continental Europe, particularly Italy. At approximately 39 minutes long, it is the shortest studio album by the band to date.\n\nFollowing extensive touring in support of their previous album ''[[Trespass (album)|Trespass]]'' (1970), which included the recruitment of Collins and Hackett, the band began writing and rehearsing for a follow-up in [[Luxford House]], [[East Sussex]], with recording following at [[Trident Studios]]. ''Nursery Cryme'' saw the band take a more aggressive direction of some songs, with substantially improved drumming. The opening piece, \"[[The Musical Box (Genesis song)|The Musical Box]]\" combined the band's trademark mix of [[twelve-string guitar]]s with harsh electric guitars and keyboards. The song, a macabre [[fairy story]] set in Victorian Britain, became the inspiration for the album cover, and went on to be a live favourite. Collins brought a new dimension to the group, covering the majority of the backing vocals (including his first lead vocal with Genesis on \"For Absent Friends\") and bringing in a sense of humour on tracks like \"Harold The Barrel\". Banks made more prominent use of the [[Mellotron]] at Hackett's suggestion and used it prominently on several tracks.\n\nThe band toured the UK and Europe for one year to promote the album, which raised their profile in both territories. The tour included a successful Italian leg in April 1972, where the group played to enthusiastic crowds. ''Nursery Cryme'' was certified Silver by the [[British Phonographic Industry]] in 2013.\n\n==Background==\nGenesis recorded their first album as a professional outfit, ''[[Trespass (album)|Trespass]]'' in June 1970, but immediately afterwards, founding member and guitarist [[Anthony Phillips]] quit owing to increased stress and unhappiness in touring.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|pp=34\u201335}} The other founders, singer [[Peter Gabriel]], keyboardist [[Tony Banks (musician)|Tony Banks]] and bassist/guitarist [[Mike Rutherford]] almost split the group up, but decided to carry on and replace drummer [[John Mayhew (musician)|John Mayhew]] with someone who was an equal stature to the others, and who could write.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=35}}\n\n[[Phil Collins]] joined as the new drummer in August, also becoming an important backing vocalist, but they were unable to find a suitable replacement for Phillips. This led to the group completing the first half of their 1970\u20131971 tour as a four-piece with Rutherford playing rhythm guitar and [[bass pedal]]s and Banks playing lead guitar lines on a [[Pianet]] through a distorted [[Distortion (music)|fuzz box]] amplifier in addition to his own keyboard parts. Banks credited this to improving his technique as it required him to play two keyboards simultaneously.{{sfn|Genesis|2007|p=96}}{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=41}} The group felt that Collins was the best drummer they had worked with at that point, and his playing style and musical tastes gave a new dimension to their sound.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=46}} Some songs were not practical to play live as a four-piece, so they decided to look again for a lead guitarist. In November 1970, [[Mick Barnard]] joined the group on recommendation from [[Friars Aylesbury]]'s David Stopps, and \"The Musical Box\" was added to the live set.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=41}} However, the rest of the group quickly realised that Barnard was not up to the same standard as the others, and they kept a look out for a better player.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=42}}\n\n[[File:Luxford House.jpg|thumb|260px|right|Rehearsals took place at [[Luxford House]]]]\nGenesis recruited [[Steve Hackett]] after Gabriel spotted an advert he placed in ''[[Melody Maker]]'' in December 1970, which read \"Imaginative guitarist/writer seeks involvement with receptive musicians, determined to drive beyond existing stagnant music forms\". He saw Genesis play a concert at the [[Lyceum Theatre, London]] on 28 December, and was told by Gabriel that Barnard would have to be replaced.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=43}} Hackett quickly developed a rapport with Rutherford, sharing their love of [[twelve-string guitar]]s and new musical ideas, and joined the band in early 1971.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=44}}\n\nWith the addition of Hackett, Genesis continued touring which included the \"Six Bob Tour\" with their [[Charisma Records]] labelmates [[Lindisfarne]] and [[Van der Graaf Generator]],{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=44}} their first overseas shows which occurred in [[Belgium]]{{sfn|Hewitt|2001|p=32}} and the first of three appearances at the annual [[Reading Festival]].{{sfn|Platts|2001|p=42}} Early attempts to work on material for their next studio album in what Hackett described as \"the odd day in a windy church hall\" while on tour were unproductive, causing the group to dedicate time. In July, they began a three-month break from touring to write and record which was Hackett's first experience of rehearsing with a group to a professional standard.{{sfn|Nursery Cryme|2007|loc=14:34\u201315:16}}\n\nAt the suggestion of Charisma's owner [[Tony Stratton-Smith]], the five retreated to [[Luxford House]], a 16th-century [[Grade II listed building]] that Stratton-Smith owned in [[Crowborough]], [[East Sussex]].{{sfn|Genesis|2007|pages=105\u2013106}} The group nicknamed the house \"Toad Hall\".{{sfn|Nursery Cryme|2007|loc=29:42\u201330:25}} The group was apprehensive about writing without Phillips, and both Collins and Hackett were unsure of what level of musical contributions they would be able to make.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=51}} Hackett was keen to explore new sounds and musical ideas, and suggested the group buy a [[Mellotron]], which Banks used as his main instrument, along with the [[Hammond organ]], instead of the piano. Some material had been written when Phillips and Mayhew were still in the band, and were reworked by the new members. Collins was a particular workaholic and was happy to jam with anyone at any time.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=53}}\n\n==Recording==\nWith the new material worked out, Genesis recorded ''Nursery Cryme'' at [[Trident Studios]] in London in August 1971 with [[John Anthony (record producer)|John Anthony]] as their producer and [[David Hentschel]] their assistant engineer who, like Anthony, had worked the same role on ''Trespass''.<ref name=cas1052>{{cite AV media notes|title=Nursery Cryme|publisher=Charisma Records|id=CAS 1052|year=1971}}</ref> The album features Hackett playing a [[Les Paul]] guitar which the band had bought him along with a Hiwatt stack amplifier. He recalled some difficulty in understanding what Banks and Rutherford were talking about as the two had devised their own sayings, for instance a passage that they had played was referred to as a \"nice guy\".{{sfn|Nursery Cryme|2007|loc=15:00\u201316:18}}\n\n===Songs===\n\n====\"The Musical Box\"====\n\"[[The Musical Box (Genesis song)|The Musical Box]]\" was a lengthy piece that described a macabre story placed in Victorian Britain. A young boy, Henry, is accidentally decapitated by his friend Cynthia while playing croquet. Returning to the house, Cynthia plays Henry's old musical box, which unleashes the spirit of Henry as an old man. Henry has become sexually frustrated and attempts to seduce Cynthia. The nurse enters the room, hurls the musical box at the wall, destroying both it and Henry.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=54}}<ref>{{cite AV media notes|title=Nursery Cryme|publisher=[[Charisma Records]]|id=CAS 1052|year=1971}}</ref>\n\nThe song originated when Phillips was in the group who would often write with Rutherford on [[twelve-string guitar|12-string acoustic guitars]]. The latter had begun to experiment with unorthodox guitar tunings and had the top three strings tuned into F sharp which provided the jangly sound heard in the opening and the chord that signalled the start of the electric guitar solo.{{sfn|Nursery Cryme|2007|loc=17:14\u201317:44}} The tuning influenced the title of an acoustic piece, \"F#\" (pronounced \"F sharp\") that became the basis of \"The Musical Box\",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.anthonyphillips.co.uk/discography/arccol.htm|title=Archive Collection|website=Anthonyphillips.co.uk|accessdate=2 August 2017}}</ref> which was developed further after Phillips's departure. The opening section of the song features both Rutherford and Banks on twelve-string.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.guitarplayer.com/technique/decoding-the-12-string-tapestry-of-early-genesis|title=Decoding the 12-string Tapestry of Early Genesis|date=21 July 2015|accessdate=23 January 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe guitar solos originated from Barnard's brief tenure in Genesis.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=41}} Hackett modified sections that Phillips and Barnard had written while adding his own arrangements to the song.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=53}} He realised that neither member had made a sound that resembled an actual musical box, so he took the opportunity to record a guitar lick that is heard before the lyric \"Here it comes again\".{{sfn|Nursery Cryme|2007|loc=18:23\u201318:43}} Gabriel, a big fan of [[The Who]] at the time, pushed for Rutherford to come up with a \"ballsy, attacking\" section in a similar style to their guitarist [[Pete Townshend]]. Gabriel incorporated themes of violence and sex into the lyrics.<ref name=gabdvd>[[#NurseryCrymeDVD|Gabriel, Peter. ''Reissues Interview 2007'' at 18:43\u201320:11]]</ref> Collins was inspired to play a rolling drum part during the middle section from hearing \"[[The Weaver's Answer]]\" by [[Family (band)|Family]], and put it to the rhythm. \"All of a sudden\", speaking about \"The Musical Box\" at this point, \"It's 'wahey we're off!'\".{{sfn|Nursery Cryme|2007|loc=21:30\u201321:50}}\n\nThe song became a live favourite during Gabriel's tenure with the band. He first decided on the idea of wearing costumes at a gig in the National Stadium, Dublin in September 1972, leaving during the instrumental break and re-appearing at the conclusion wearing his wife's red dress and a fox's head.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|pp=69\u201370}} Later, he would wear an \"old man\" mask for the song's ending, acting out the part of the aged Henry.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2014/sep/03/genesis-10-of-the-best|title=Genesis: 20 of the best|newspaper=The Guardian|date=3 September 2014|accessdate=27 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n====Other songs====\n[[File:Rbk dolde.jpg|thumb|left|\"The Return of the Giant Hogweed\" described an outbreak of ''[[Heracleum mantegazzianum]]'' attacking the human race.]]\n\"For Absent Friends\" is an acoustic song that marked Hackett's first significant writing contribution for the group, and the first Genesis song with Collins on lead vocals.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=55}} After coming up with the music himself and the lyrics with Collins, Hackett recalled being shy when he presented it to Gabriel as they were the new members of the group.{{sfn|Nursery Cryme|2007|loc=24:41\u201325:40}}\n\n\"The Return of the Giant Hogweed\" warns of the spread of the toxic plant ''[[Heracleum mantegazzianum]]'' after it was \"captured\" in Russia and brought to England by a Victorian explorer. Though the real plant is extremely toxic and dangerous, the song's lyrics are a humorous exaggeration, suggesting the plant is attempting to take over the human race.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=55}} Both \"The Musical Box\" and \"The Return of the Giant Hogweed\" feature Hackett's first use of [[Tapping|guitar tapping]], a technique whereby the index finger of the plucking hand is applied directly to the guitar [[fret board]]. The opening to the latter features Hackett and Banks playing triplets in harmony.{{sfn|Nursery Cryme|2007|loc=31:02\u201331:49}}{{efn|\"Tapping\" did not attract mainstream attention until [[Eddie Van Halen]] demonstrated it in his instrumental \"[[Eruption (instrumental)|Eruption]]\", seven years after ''Nursery Cryme''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.musicradar.com/news/guitars/steve-hackett-how-i-invented-finger-tapping-542029|title=Steve Hackett: how I invented finger tapping|website=Musicradar.com|accessdate=2 August 2017}}</ref>}}\n\n\"Seven Stones\" was conceived by Banks who used what Rutherford described as \"his big, schmaltzy, music hall chords [that] he loved.\"{{sfn|Rutherford|2014|p=76}} ''[[Melody Maker]]'' reporter [[Chris Welch]] described the song as \"strangely mournful and inconclusive.\" He theorised that the old man addressed in the lyric is expressing his \"profound belief that the secret of success and good fortune is based purely on random events and chance.\"{{sfn|Welch|2011|p=34}}\n\n\"Harold the Barrel\" showed a humorous side to Genesis, which was encouraged by Collins. The lyrics show [[black humour]] of a man contemplating suicide by jumping off a building, with wordplay influenced by [[John Lennon]]'s ''[[In His Own Write]]''.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|pp=46,55}} The track was recorded with Gabriel and Collins singing the song as a duet. Their vocals were mixed onto the same audio track so they cannot be separated.{{sfn|Nursery Cryme|2007|loc=26:31\u201326:50}}{{efn|Gabriel and Collins would continue to sing together on several Genesis songs during their shared time in the band, performing a \"composite voice\" according to Hackett. Collins successfully replaced Gabriel as lead singer in 1975 because his voice was already familiar to listeners.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=119}}}}\n\n\"Harlequin\" was written by Rutherford. He played two separate guitar parts on a single 12-string which he thought produced \"pretty dodgy\" results, and was also critical of his lyrics.{{sfn|Rutherford|2014|p=76}}\n\n\"The Fountain of Salmacis\" tells the story of [[Salmacis]], the Greek mythological [[Naiad]] who became the first [[hermaphrodite]]. It originated from a short rundown passage that Banks had come up with while at university. The track makes use of the Mellotron, with an influence from [[King Crimson]]'s ''[[In the Court of the Crimson King]]''. Banks thought the instrument greatly complemented his piece when combined with the organ. It became the basis for \"The Fountain of Salmacis\" which was taken further to a complete song as the result of group jams.{{sfn|Nursery Cryme|2007|loc=28:26\u201329:24}} Hackett particularly enjoyed the time he came up with his ending guitar solo, which occurred around midnight at Luxford House during a rare moment when the group were up for recording.{{sfn|Nursery Cryme|2007|loc=29:42\u201330:25}}{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=55}}\n\n==Cover==\nThe album's sleeve was designed and illustrated by [[Paul Whitehead]] who had also designed the cover for ''Trespass'' and the band's next album, ''[[Foxtrot (album)|Foxtrot]]''.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CpfMOEIZag4C&pg=PA15|page=15|title=Genesis and The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway|author=Kevin Holm-Hudson|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|date= 2008|isbn=9780754661474}}</ref> The cover depicts characters and scenes based on \"The Musical Box\" and Coxhill, the manor house with a croquet lawn, itself based on the Victorian home Gabriel grew up in.{{sfn|Macan|1997|pp=60\u201361}} When the group originally saw Whitehead's painting, they said it didn't look old enough, so he varnished it with honey which made it look like it was an antique from the 19th century.

The group felt discouraged by the general indifference from the record company, and believed songs like \"The Musical Box\" could have been as popular as \"[[Stairway to Heaven]]\", released at the same time.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=57}}\n\nThe album did not chart in the UK until May 1974, when it peaked at {{thinspace|No.| 39}},{{sfn|Genesis|2007|p=349}} and charted there again when reissued in 1984, reaching {{thinspace|No.| 68}}.

It's the godawful production, a murky, distant stew that at best bubbles quietly when what is desperately needed are the explosions of drums and guitars, the screaming of the organ, the abrasive rasp of vocal cords.\" He nonetheless remarked positively on some of the songs, and noted that he saw promise in the band.<ref name=\"RS\">{{cite magazine |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/genesis/albums/album/304752/review/5940391/nursery_cryme |title=Genesis: Nursery Cryme : Music Reviews : Rolling Stone |first=Richard |last=Cromelin |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=26 October 1972 |accessdate=7 June 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080430233653/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/genesis/albums/album/304752/review/5940391/nursery_cryme |archivedate=30 April 2008 |url-status=dead}}</ref> In a full page advert published in ''Melody Maker'', keyboardist [[Keith Emerson]] wrote a positive summary: \"This is not the start for Genesis neither is it the end.

[[BBC Music]] praised the two new members of the band as fundamental to Genesis's artistic success, remarking \"Collins' snappy drums were augmented by his uncanny ability to sound not unlike Gabriel&nbsp;...

It was their first to feature drummer/vocalist [[Phil Collins]] and guitarist [[Steve Hackett]]. The album received a mixed response from critics and was not initially a commercial success; it did not enter the UK chart until 1974, when it reached its peak at No. 39. However, the album was successful in Continental Europe, particularly Italy. At approximately 39 minutes long, it is the shortest studio album by the band to date.\n\nFollowing extensive touring in support of their previous album ''[[Trespass (album)|Trespass]]'' (1970), which included the recruitment of Collins and Hackett, the band began writing and rehearsing for a follow-up in [[Luxford House]], [[East Sussex]], with recording following at [[Trident Studios]]. ''Nursery Cryme'' saw the band take a more aggressive direction of some songs, with substantially improved drumming. The opening piece, \"[[The Musical Box (Genesis song)|The Musical Box]]\" combined the band's trademark mix of [[twelve-string guitar]]s with harsh electric guitars and keyboards. The song, a macabre [[fairy story]] set in Victorian Britain, became the inspiration for the album cover, and went on to be a live favourite. Collins brought a new dimension to the group, covering the majority of the backing vocals (including his first lead vocal with Genesis on \"For Absent Friends\") and bringing in a sense of humour on tracks like \"Harold The Barrel\". Banks made more prominent use of the [[Mellotron]] at Hackett's suggestion and used it prominently on several tracks.\n\nThe band toured the UK and Europe for one year to promote the album, which raised their profile in both territories. The tour included a successful Italian leg in April 1972, where the group played to enthusiastic crowds. ''Nursery Cryme'' was certified Silver by the [[British Phonographic Industry]] in 2013.\n\n==Background==\nGenesis recorded their first album as a professional outfit, ''[[Trespass (album)|Trespass]]'' in June 1970, but immediately afterwards, founding member and guitarist [[Anthony Phillips]] quit owing to increased stress and unhappiness in touring.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|pp=34\u201335}} The other founders, singer [[Peter Gabriel]], keyboardist [[Tony Banks (musician)|Tony Banks]] and bassist/guitarist [[Mike Rutherford]] almost split the group up, but decided to carry on and replace drummer [[John Mayhew (musician)|John Mayhew]] with someone who was an equal stature to the others, and who could write.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=35}}\n\n[[Phil Collins]] joined as the new drummer in August, also becoming an important backing vocalist, but they were unable to find a suitable replacement for Phillips. This led to the group completing the first half of their 1970\u20131971 tour as a four-piece with Rutherford playing rhythm guitar and [[bass pedal]]s and Banks playing lead guitar lines on a [[Pianet]] through a distorted [[Distortion (music)|fuzz box]] amplifier in addition to his own keyboard parts. Banks credited this to improving his technique as it required him to play two keyboards simultaneously.{{sfn|Genesis|2007|p=96}}{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=41}} The group felt that Collins was the best drummer they had worked with at that point, and his playing style and musical tastes gave a new dimension to their sound.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=46}} Some songs were not practical to play live as a four-piece, so they decided to look again for a lead guitarist. In November 1970, [[Mick Barnard]] joined the group on recommendation from [[Friars Aylesbury]]'s David Stopps, and \"The Musical Box\" was added to the live set.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=41}} However, the rest of the group quickly realised that Barnard was not up to the same standard as the others, and they kept a look out for a better player.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=42}}\n\n[[File:Luxford House.jpg|thumb|260px|right|Rehearsals took place at [[Luxford House]]]]\nGenesis recruited [[Steve Hackett]] after Gabriel spotted an advert he placed in ''[[Melody Maker]]'' in December 1970, which read \"Imaginative guitarist/writer seeks involvement with receptive musicians, determined to drive beyond existing stagnant music forms\". He saw Genesis play a concert at the [[Lyceum Theatre, London]] on 28 December, and was told by Gabriel that Barnard would have to be replaced.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=43}} Hackett quickly developed a rapport with Rutherford, sharing their love of [[twelve-string guitar]]s and new musical ideas, and joined the band in early 1971.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=44}}\n\nWith the addition of Hackett, Genesis continued touring which included the \"Six Bob Tour\" with their [[Charisma Records]] labelmates [[Lindisfarne]] and [[Van der Graaf Generator]],{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=44}} their first overseas shows which occurred in [[Belgium]]{{sfn|Hewitt|2001|p=32}} and the first of three appearances at the annual [[Reading Festival]].{{sfn|Platts|2001|p=42}} Early attempts to work on material for their next studio album in what Hackett described as \"the odd day in a windy church hall\" while on tour were unproductive, causing the group to dedicate time. In July, they began a three-month break from touring to write and record which was Hackett's first experience of rehearsing with a group to a professional standard.{{sfn|Nursery Cryme|2007|loc=14:34\u201315:16}}\n\nAt the suggestion of Charisma's owner [[Tony Stratton-Smith]], the five retreated to [[Luxford House]], a 16th-century [[Grade II listed building]] that Stratton-Smith owned in [[Crowborough]], [[East Sussex]].{{sfn|Genesis|2007|pages=105\u2013106}} The group nicknamed the house \"Toad Hall\".{{sfn|Nursery Cryme|2007|loc=29:42\u201330:25}} The group was apprehensive about writing without Phillips, and both Collins and Hackett were unsure of what level of musical contributions they would be able to make.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=51}} Hackett was keen to explore new sounds and musical ideas, and suggested the group buy a [[Mellotron]], which Banks used as his main instrument, along with the [[Hammond organ]], instead of the piano. Some material had been written when Phillips and Mayhew were still in the band, and were reworked by the new members. Collins was a particular workaholic and was happy to jam with anyone at any time.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=53}}\n\n==Recording==\nWith the new material worked out, Genesis recorded ''Nursery Cryme'' at [[Trident Studios]] in London in August 1971 with [[John Anthony (record producer)|John Anthony]] as their producer and [[David Hentschel]] their assistant engineer who, like Anthony, had worked the same role on ''Trespass''.<ref name=cas1052>{{cite AV media notes|title=Nursery Cryme|publisher=Charisma Records|id=CAS 1052|year=1971}}</ref> The album features Hackett playing a [[Les Paul]] guitar which the band had bought him along with a Hiwatt stack amplifier. He recalled some difficulty in understanding what Banks and Rutherford were talking about as the two had devised their own sayings, for instance a passage that they had played was referred to as a \"nice guy\".{{sfn|Nursery Cryme|2007|loc=15:00\u201316:18}}\n\n===Songs===\n\n====\"The Musical Box\"====\n\"[[The Musical Box (Genesis song)|The Musical Box]]\" was a lengthy piece that described a macabre story placed in Victorian Britain. A young boy, Henry, is accidentally decapitated by his friend Cynthia while playing croquet. Returning to the house, Cynthia plays Henry's old musical box, which unleashes the spirit of Henry as an old man. Henry has become sexually frustrated and attempts to seduce Cynthia. The nurse enters the room, hurls the musical box at the wall, destroying both it and Henry.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=54}}<ref>{{cite AV media notes|title=Nursery Cryme|publisher=[[Charisma Records]]|id=CAS 1052|year=1971}}</ref>\n\nThe song originated when Phillips was in the group who would often write with Rutherford on [[twelve-string guitar|12-string acoustic guitars]]. The latter had begun to experiment with unorthodox guitar tunings and had the top three strings tuned into F sharp which provided the jangly sound heard in the opening and the chord that signalled the start of the electric guitar solo.{{sfn|Nursery Cryme|2007|loc=17:14\u201317:44}} The tuning influenced the title of an acoustic piece, \"F#\" (pronounced \"F sharp\") that became the basis of \"The Musical Box\",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.anthonyphillips.co.uk/discography/arccol.htm|title=Archive Collection|website=Anthonyphillips.co.uk|accessdate=2 August 2017}}</ref> which was developed further after Phillips's departure. The opening section of the song features both Rutherford and Banks on twelve-string.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.guitarplayer.com/technique/decoding-the-12-string-tapestry-of-early-genesis|title=Decoding the 12-string Tapestry of Early Genesis|date=21 July 2015|accessdate=23 January 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe guitar solos originated from Barnard's brief tenure in Genesis.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=41}} Hackett modified sections that Phillips and Barnard had written while adding his own arrangements to the song.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=53}} He realised that neither member had made a sound that resembled an actual musical box, so he took the opportunity to record a guitar lick that is heard before the lyric \"Here it comes again\".{{sfn|Nursery Cryme|2007|loc=18:23\u201318:43}} Gabriel, a big fan of [[The Who]] at the time, pushed for Rutherford to come up with a \"ballsy, attacking\" section in a similar style to their guitarist [[Pete Townshend]]. Gabriel incorporated themes of violence and sex into the lyrics.<ref name=gabdvd>[[#NurseryCrymeDVD|Gabriel, Peter. ''Reissues Interview 2007'' at 18:43\u201320:11]]</ref> Collins was inspired to play a rolling drum part during the middle section from hearing \"[[The Weaver's Answer]]\" by [[Family (band)|Family]], and put it to the rhythm. \"All of a sudden\", speaking about \"The Musical Box\" at this point, \"It's 'wahey we're off!'\".{{sfn|Nursery Cryme|2007|loc=21:30\u201321:50}}\n\nThe song became a live favourite during Gabriel's tenure with the band. He first decided on the idea of wearing costumes at a gig in the National Stadium, Dublin in September 1972, leaving during the instrumental break and re-appearing at the conclusion wearing his wife's red dress and a fox's head.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|pp=69\u201370}} Later, he would wear an \"old man\" mask for the song's ending, acting out the part of the aged Henry.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2014/sep/03/genesis-10-of-the-best|title=Genesis: 20 of the best|newspaper=The Guardian|date=3 September 2014|accessdate=27 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n====Other songs====\n[[File:Rbk dolde.jpg|thumb|left|\"The Return of the Giant Hogweed\" described an outbreak of ''[[Heracleum mantegazzianum]]'' attacking the human race.]]\n\"For Absent Friends\" is an acoustic song that marked Hackett's first significant writing contribution for the group, and the first Genesis song with Collins on lead vocals.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=55}} After coming up with the music himself and the lyrics with Collins, Hackett recalled being shy when he presented it to Gabriel as they were the new members of the group.{{sfn|Nursery Cryme|2007|loc=24:41\u201325:40}}\n\n\"The Return of the Giant Hogweed\" warns of the spread of the toxic plant ''[[Heracleum mantegazzianum]]'' after it was \"captured\" in Russia and brought to England by a Victorian explorer. Though the real plant is extremely toxic and dangerous, the song's lyrics are a humorous exaggeration, suggesting the plant is attempting to take over the human race.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=55}} Both \"The Musical Box\" and \"The Return of the Giant Hogweed\" feature Hackett's first use of [[Tapping|guitar tapping]], a technique whereby the index finger of the plucking hand is applied directly to the guitar [[fret board]]. The opening to the latter features Hackett and Banks playing triplets in harmony.{{sfn|Nursery Cryme|2007|loc=31:02\u201331:49}}{{efn|\"Tapping\" did not attract mainstream attention until [[Eddie Van Halen]] demonstrated it in his instrumental \"[[Eruption (instrumental)|Eruption]]\", seven years after ''Nursery Cryme''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.musicradar.com/news/guitars/steve-hackett-how-i-invented-finger-tapping-542029|title=Steve Hackett: how I invented finger tapping|website=Musicradar.com|accessdate=2 August 2017}}</ref>}}\n\n\"Seven Stones\" was conceived by Banks who used what Rutherford described as \"his big, schmaltzy, music hall chords [that] he loved.\"{{sfn|Rutherford|2014|p=76}} ''[[Melody Maker]]'' reporter [[Chris Welch]] described the song as \"strangely mournful and inconclusive.\" He theorised that the old man addressed in the lyric is expressing his \"profound belief that the secret of success and good fortune is based purely on random events and chance.\"{{sfn|Welch|2011|p=34}}\n\n\"Harold the Barrel\" showed a humorous side to Genesis, which was encouraged by Collins. The lyrics show [[black humour]] of a man contemplating suicide by jumping off a building, with wordplay influenced by [[John Lennon]]'s ''[[In His Own Write]]''.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|pp=46,55}} The track was recorded with Gabriel and Collins singing the song as a duet. Their vocals were mixed onto the same audio track so they cannot be separated.{{sfn|Nursery Cryme|2007|loc=26:31\u201326:50}}{{efn|Gabriel and Collins would continue to sing together on several Genesis songs during their shared time in the band, performing a \"composite voice\" according to Hackett. Collins successfully replaced Gabriel as lead singer in 1975 because his voice was already familiar to listeners.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=119}}}}\n\n\"Harlequin\" was written by Rutherford. He played two separate guitar parts on a single 12-string which he thought produced \"pretty dodgy\" results, and was also critical of his lyrics.{{sfn|Rutherford|2014|p=76}}\n\n\"The Fountain of Salmacis\" tells the story of [[Salmacis]], the Greek mythological [[Naiad]] who became the first [[hermaphrodite]]. It originated from a short rundown passage that Banks had come up with while at university. The track makes use of the Mellotron, with an influence from [[King Crimson]]'s ''[[In the Court of the Crimson King]]''. Banks thought the instrument greatly complemented his piece when combined with the organ. It became the basis for \"The Fountain of Salmacis\" which was taken further to a complete song as the result of group jams.{{sfn|Nursery Cryme|2007|loc=28:26\u201329:24}} Hackett particularly enjoyed the time he came up with his ending guitar solo, which occurred around midnight at Luxford House during a rare moment when the group were up for recording.{{sfn|Nursery Cryme|2007|loc=29:42\u201330:25}}{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=55}}\n\n==Cover==\nThe album's sleeve was designed and illustrated by [[Paul Whitehead]] who had also designed the cover for ''Trespass'' and the band's next album, ''[[Foxtrot (album)|Foxtrot]]''.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CpfMOEIZag4C&pg=PA15|page=15|title=Genesis and The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway|author=Kevin Holm-Hudson|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|date= 2008|isbn=9780754661474}}</ref> The cover depicts characters and scenes based on \"The Musical Box\" and Coxhill, the manor house with a croquet lawn, itself based on the Victorian home Gabriel grew up in.{{sfn|Macan|1997|pp=60\u201361}} When the group originally saw Whitehead's painting, they said it didn't look old enough, so he varnished it with honey which made it look like it was an antique from the 19th century.

[[BBC Music]] praised the two new members of the band as fundamental to Genesis's artistic success, remarking \"Collins' snappy drums were augmented by his uncanny ability to sound not unlike Gabriel&nbsp;...

The abnormal vessels are even better seen with [[fluorescein angiography]]. In advanced disease, [[glaucoma]] is diagnosed by measuring [[intraocular pressure]] and cataract by using [[slit lamp]] biomicroscopy.\n\n===Imaging findings===\nThe most consistent finding are widespread calcifications, which involve\nthe [[white matter]] of the [[cerebrum]] mostly adjacent to the junction with the [[grey matter]], the [[Thalamus|thalami]], the [[basal ganglia]] and the [[brainstem]].<ref name=\"pmid16943371\"/><ref name=\"pmid18076099\"/> The white matter of the [[cerebellum]] and the [[Dentate nucleus|dentate nuclei]] are less often involved. However, the brain may appear normal in the neonatal period. The calcifications are visible both with [[X-ray computed tomography|computed tomography]] and with [[magnetic resonance imaging]].\n\nMagnetic resonance imaging shows additionally diffuse or patchy [[white matter]] changes, especially in the periventricular region, the thalami and the [[internal capsule]]. Cerebellar and brainstem lesions are less common. Imaging also uncovers parenchymal cysts situated mainly in the thalamic region and more rarely in the brainstem, the [[parietal lobe]] and the [[frontal lobe]].\n\nThe long bones may be [[osteopenia|osteopenic]] and various skeletal changes are found in several patients, such as metaphyseal sclerosis and mild flaring, which is most pronounced in the [[femur]] and  [[tibia]].<ref name=\"pmid15002047\"/><ref name=\"pmid11992766\"/><ref name=\"pmid21523908\"/>\n\n===Laboratory findings===\nThe [[cerebrospinal fluid]] and blood tests are typically normal, except for [[anemia]] and [[thrombocytopenia]] in some children.<ref name=\"pmid16943371\"/><ref name=\"pmid18076099\"/><ref name=\"pmid11992766\"/>\n\n==Screening==\n\nBecause of the rarity of the syndrome, it is not routinely screened before birth.

[[Retinal detachment]] is repaired with a [[scleral buckle]] or with [[vitrectomy]]. Removal or [[enucleation of the eye]] is a last resort option if the eye already has become blind and painful.\n\nRepeated [[blood transfusion]]s may be needed to control [[anemia]], and [[thrombocytopenia]] can be managed with [[splenectomy]].<ref name=\"pmid16943371\"/>\n\n==Prognosis==\nThe neurological symptoms are progressive and can lead to severe [[spasticity]], [[Corticobulbar tract|bulbar symptoms]] and [[dysarthria]] within one to two decades.<ref name=\"pmid16943371\"/><ref name=\"pmid15002047\"/> The life span is shorter than normal.

The accumulation of the proteinaceous exudate and macrophages thickens the [[retina]], leading to exudative [[retinal detachment]].\n\n==Diagnosis==\n\n===Clinical===\nThe retinal changes are easily identified by [[ophthalmoscopy]], which is performed under [[general anesthesia]] if the child is very young. The abnormal vessels are even better seen with [[fluorescein angiography]]. In advanced disease, [[glaucoma]] is diagnosed by measuring [[intraocular pressure]] and cataract by using [[slit lamp]] biomicroscopy.\n\n===Imaging findings===\nThe most consistent finding are widespread calcifications, which involve\nthe [[white matter]] of the [[cerebrum]] mostly adjacent to the junction with the [[grey matter]], the [[Thalamus|thalami]], the [[basal ganglia]] and the [[brainstem]].<ref name=\"pmid16943371\"/><ref name=\"pmid18076099\"/> The white matter of the [[cerebellum]] and the [[Dentate nucleus|dentate nuclei]] are less often involved. However, the brain may appear normal in the neonatal period. The calcifications are visible both with [[X-ray computed tomography|computed tomography]] and with [[magnetic resonance imaging]].\n\nMagnetic resonance imaging shows additionally diffuse or patchy [[white matter]] changes, especially in the periventricular region, the thalami and the [[internal capsule]]. Cerebellar and brainstem lesions are less common. Imaging also uncovers parenchymal cysts situated mainly in the thalamic region and more rarely in the brainstem, the [[parietal lobe]] and the [[frontal lobe]].\n\nThe long bones may be [[osteopenia|osteopenic]] and various skeletal changes are found in several patients, such as metaphyseal sclerosis and mild flaring, which is most pronounced in the [[femur]] and  [[tibia]].<ref name=\"pmid15002047\"/><ref name=\"pmid11992766\"/><ref name=\"pmid21523908\"/>\n\n===Laboratory findings===\nThe [[cerebrospinal fluid]] and blood tests are typically normal, except for [[anemia]] and [[thrombocytopenia]] in some children.<ref name=\"pmid16943371\"/><ref name=\"pmid18076099\"/><ref name=\"pmid11992766\"/>\n\n==Screening==\n\nBecause of the rarity of the syndrome, it is not routinely screened before birth. [[Prenatal diagnosis]] is possible in families in which a prior child has been diagnosed, because the responsible gene ''CTC1''is known.<ref name=\"pmid22267198\"/><ref name=\"PolviA\"/>\n\n==Management==\n\nSeizures are managed with anticonvulsive medications.\n\n[[Laser coagulation]] or [[cryoablation]] (freezing) of the retina can be used to destroy the abnormal blood vessels. [[Retinal detachment]] is repaired with a [[scleral buckle]] or with [[vitrectomy]]. Removal or [[enucleation of the eye]] is a last resort option if the eye already has become blind and painful.\n\nRepeated [[blood transfusion]]s may be needed to control [[anemia]], and [[thrombocytopenia]] can be managed with [[splenectomy]].<ref name=\"pmid16943371\"/>\n\n==Prognosis==\nThe neurological symptoms are progressive and can lead to severe [[spasticity]], [[Corticobulbar tract|bulbar symptoms]] and [[dysarthria]] within one to two decades.<ref name=\"pmid16943371\"/><ref name=\"pmid15002047\"/> The life span is shorter than normal. Death occurs between 2 and 30 years of age, depending on the severity of the syndrome. The immediate cause of death is [[pneumonia]], fulminant intestinal bleeding or [[Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome|multiple organ dysfunction]].<ref name=\"pmid16943371\"/>\n\nIf not treated, the retinal detachment can lead to [[ischemia]] and [[Rubeosis iridis|growth of new blood vessels]] over the [[Iris (anatomy)|iris]] and [[Anterior chamber of eyeball|anterior chamber angle]]. This in turn can cause secondary [[glaucoma]], [[cataract]] and, ultimately, [[blindness]] of the eye.<ref name=\"pmid16943371\"/><ref name=\"pmid18076099\"/>\n\n==Epidemiology==\n\nThis syndrome is usually sporadic although families with two or more affected siblings of both sexes are known.<ref name=\"pmid16943371\"/><ref name=\"pmid15002047\"/>\n\n==History==\n\nA child who was eventually diagnosed with cerebroretinal microangiopathy with calcifications and cysts was first described in the literature in 1987.<ref name=\"pmid3402627\"/><ref name=\"pmid3556653\">{{cite journal |vauthors=McGettrick PM, Loeffler KU | title = Bilateral Coats' disease in an infant (a clinical, angiographic, light and electron microscopic study) | journal = Eye (Lond) | volume = 1 | issue = Pt 1 | pages = 136\u201345 | year = 1988 | pmid = 3556653 | pmc = | doi = 10.1038/eye.1987.20}}</ref> The disorder was suspected of being allelic with either the [[Revesz syndrome]]<ref name=\"pmid18076099\"/> or leukoencephalopathy with calcifications and cysts.<ref name=\"pmid16943371\"/><ref name=\"pmid18076099\"/> However, [[Revesz syndrome]], a severe variant of [[dyskeratosis congenita]], was later shown to result from heterozygous dominant mutations in the ''TINF2'' gene,<ref name=\"pmid18252230\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Savage SA, Giri N, Baerlocher GM, Orr N, Lansdorp PM, Alter BP | title = TINF2, a component of the shelterin telomere protection complex, is mutated in dyskeratosis congenita | journal = Am J Hum Genet | volume = 82 | issue = 2 | pages = 501\u20139 |date=Feb 2008 | pmid = 18252230 | pmc = 2427222| doi = 10.1016/j.ajhg.2007.10.004}}</ref> which encodes TRF1-interacting nuclear factor 2, a major component of the [[telomere]] protecting shelterin complex, and individuals with the leukoencephalopathy with calcifications and cysts [[phenotype]] have not had mutations in the ''CTC1'' gene.<ref name=\"pmid22267198\"/><ref name=\"PolviA\"/>\n\nBefore the causative mutation was identified, mutations were sought from the [[Wnt signalling pathway]] because its components were known to be responsible for [[Norrie disease]] and [[familial exudative vitreoretinopathy]], which share features of the eye phenotype but not the brain or systemic abnormalities.<ref name=\"pmid16943371\"/><ref name=\"pmid18076099\"/>\n\n[[Coats' disease]] is named after George Coats.<ref>{{WhoNamedIt|doctor|1926}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Coats G | title = Forms of retinal disease with massive exudation | journal = R Lond Ophthalmol Hosp Rep | volume = 17 | issue = 3 | pages = 440\u2013525 |date=Nov 1908 | pmid = | pmc = | doi = }}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n== External links ==\n{{Medical resources\n|  DiseasesDB      = \n|  ICD10           = {{ICD10|Q|87|8|q|87}}\n|  ICD9            = {{ICD9|759.89}}\n|  ICDO            = \n|  OMIM            = 612199\n|  OMIM_mult       = \n|  MedlinePlus     = \n|  eMedicineSubj   = \n|  eMedicineTopic  = \n|  MeshID          = \n|  GeneReviewsName = \n}}\n[[Category:Genetic diseases and disorders]]\n[[Category:Rare diseases]]\n[[Category:Telomeres]]\n", "name_user": "Dismanet", "label": "safe", "comment": "Adding new medical resources.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebroretinal_microangiopathy_with_calcifications_and_cysts"}

The winningest coach in [[National Football League]] (NFL) history, Shula is best known for his time being the longtime head coach of the [[Miami Dolphins]], leading them to two [[Super Bowl]] victories, as well as the [[1972 Miami Dolphins season|only perfect season]] in NFL history. He was previously the head coach of the [[Baltimore Colts]], with whom he won the [[1968 NFL Championship Game|1968 NFL Championship]]. Shula was drafted out of [[John Carroll Blue Streaks football|John Carroll University]] in the [[1951 NFL Draft]], and he played professionally as a [[defensive back]] for the [[Cleveland Browns]], [[Baltimore Colts]], and [[Washington Redskins]].\n\nShula was named 1993 [[Sportsman of the Year]] by ''[[Sports Illustrated]]''. He had only two losing seasons in his 33-year career as a head coach in the NFL. He led his teams to six Super Bowls. In [[Super Bowl III]], his first, the [[1968 Baltimore Colts season|Colts]] set the record for the longest period to be [[shut out]], not scoring until 3:19 remained in the game, which was later broken in [[Super Bowl VII]]. At [[Super Bowl VI|his next Super Bowl]], the [[1971 Miami Dolphins season|Dolphins]] set the Super Bowl record for the lowest points scored by any team, with one field goal. The [[Super Bowl VII|following year]], he coached a [[perfect season]] and broke the record of longest shutout, this time with his team on the winning side, not giving up any points until 2:07 remained. The Dolphins [[Super Bowl VIII|repeated]] as Super Bowl champions the following season, as they defeated the [[Minnesota Vikings]] 24\u20137. He holds the NFL record for most career wins as a head coach with 347 (328 in the regular season). Shula was inducted into the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] in 1997.\n\n==Early life and college==\nShula was born on January 4, 1930 in [[Grand River, Ohio]], a small town along the [[Lake Erie]] shore in the northeastern part of the state.<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.upi.com/Top_News/2019/01/04/UPI-Almanac-for-Friday-Jan-4-2019/5471546221584/|title=UPI Almanac for Friday, Jan. 4, 2019|agency=[[United Press International]]|date=January 4, 2019|accessdate=September 4, 2019|archivedate=January 5, 2019 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20190105012355/http://www.upi.com/Top_News/2019/01/04/UPI-Almanac-for-Friday-Jan-4-2019/5471546221584/|url-status=live|quote=Pro Football Hall of Fame coach and player Don Shula in 1930 (age 89)}}</ref><ref name=\"News-Herald article\">{{cite news |last=Schudel |first=Jeff |title=Don Shula at 80: From Harvey to Hall |url=http://www.news-herald.com/general-news/20100718/don-shula-at-80-from-harvey-to-hall-with-slideshow-video |accessdate=November 2, 2013 |newspaper=The News-Herald |date=August 9, 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103234608/http://www.news-herald.com/general-news/20100718/don-shula-at-80-from-harvey-to-hall-with-slideshow-video |archivedate=November 3, 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> His parents, Dan and Mary, were of Hungarian origin, having immigrated when they were children.<ref name=\"Shula's Roots story\">{{cite news |title=Shula's Roots \u2013 A Rock Foundation |url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1993-11-15/sports/9311150043_1_shula-s-roots-shula-s-foundation-hometown |accessdate=November 2, 2013 |newspaper=Sun-Sentinel |date=November 15, 1993 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103200841/http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1993-11-15/sports/9311150043_1_shula-s-roots-shula-s-foundation-hometown |archivedate=November 3, 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Shula's father Dan worked for $9 a week at a rose nursery and saved up to buy the small house where Shula spent his early childhood.<ref name=\"Shula's Roots story\" /> The house was next door to a grocery store in Grand River owned by Mary's parents.<ref name=\"Shula's Roots story\" /> Shula played football in his neighborhood as a child, but his parents forbade it after he got a gash on his face when he was 11.<ref name=\"News-Herald article\" />\n\nAs Shula's family expanded\u2014he had six siblings, including a set of triplets born in 1936\u2014his father got a job in the local fishing industry for $15 a week, and later worked at a [[rayon]] plant in nearby [[Painesville, Ohio]].<ref name=\"Shula's Roots story\" /> Shula attended elementary school at St. Mary's, a private [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] school in Painesville; his mother was a devout Catholic, and his father converted to that denomination when they married.<ref name=\"Shula's Roots story\" /> He later attended [[Thomas W.

As a result of Shula's signing, the team was charged with [[Tampering (sport)|tampering]] by the NFL, which forced the Dolphins to give their first-round pick to the Colts.<ref>[http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1084265/index.htm Olsen, Jack. \"The Rosenbloom-Robbie Bowl\", ''Sports Illustrated'', November 9, 1970.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725123948/http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1084265/index.htm |date=July 25, 2008 }}</ref> The decision was controversial because Shula and Robbie's negotiations and signing were conducted before and after the official [[AFL-NFL Merger|NFL/AFL merger]], respectively. Had the negotiations been concluded before the merger, while the NFL and AFL were rivals, the NFL's antitampering rules could not have been applied.\n\nShula's Miami teams were known for great offensive lines (led by [[Larry Little]], [[Jim Langer]], and [[Bob Kuechenberg]]), strong running games (featuring [[Larry Csonka]], [[Jim Kiick]], and [[Mercury Morris]]), solid quarterbacking (by [[Bob Griese]] and [[Earl Morrall]]), excellent receivers (in [[Paul Warfield]], [[Howard Twilley]], and TE [[Jim Mandich]]) and a defense that worked well as a cohesive unit. The Dolphins were known as \"The No-Name Defense\", though they had a number of great players, including DT [[Manny Fernandez (American football)|Manny Fernandez]] and MLB [[Nick Buoniconti]].<ref>[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/edb/reader.html?magID=SI&issueDate=19720110&mode=reader_vault Underwood, John. \"Two That Were Super\", ''Sports Illustrated'', January 10, 1972.]</ref>\n\nIn 1972, the Dolphins were unbeaten in the regular season, 14\u20130\u20130. They swept the playoffs and finished [[Perfect season#The Perfect Season|17\u20130\u20130]].\n\nShula changed his coaching strategy as his personnel changed. His Super Bowl teams in [[1971 Miami Dolphins season|1971]], [[1972 Miami Dolphins season|1972]], [[1973 Miami Dolphins season|1973]], and [[1982 Miami Dolphins season|1982]] were keyed by a run-first offensive strategy and a dominating defense. In [[1983 NFL Draft|1983]], shortly after losing [[Super Bowl XVII]] to the [[1982 Washington Redskins season|Washington Redskins]], the Dolphins drafted quarterback [[Dan Marino]] out of the [[Pittsburgh Panthers football|University of Pittsburgh]]. Marino won the starting job halfway through the [[1983 NFL season|1983 regular season]], and by [[1984 NFL season|1984]], the Dolphins were back in the [[Super Bowl XIX|Super Bowl]], due largely to Marino's record 5,084 yards through the air and 48 touchdown passes.\n\nIn addition to his well-documented regular season success, Don Shula also achieved historical heights in the post season as well.  The Dolphins' January, 1974 Super Bowl win over the Minnesota Vikings proved to be Shula's second NFL championship following the only perfect season in NFL history.  His six total Super Bowl appearances as a Head Coach was the most ever at the time of his retirement in 1995 and today ranks as second all time.  Don Shula also holds the unique distinction as the first of only three NFL head coaches to take the same NFL team to three, or more, consecutive Super Bowls. Don Shula was also the 2nd of only 13 all-time NFL head coaches to win two or more Super Bowls.  His post season success is highlighted by the fact that six of the first nineteen Super Bowls had Don Shula prowling the sidelines as a Head Coach for the Colts and Dolphins.  Despite not having coached in over 25 years, Don Shula today is second all time in AFC Championship Game appearances with seven, and third all-time with 19 post season wins.  \n\nHis retirement following the 1995 regular season ended one of the greatest coaching legacies in NFL history. He set numerous records in his 33 seasons as a head coach. He is first in most games coached (526) and most consecutive seasons coached (33). Shula won two Super Bowls while also being the first head coach to coach the same team to three consecutive Super Bowls.  Shula remains the only NFL coach to achieve NFL perfection.\n\nShula was the head coach of the [[1972 Miami Dolphins season|1972 Miami Dolphins]], which finished a perfect 17\u20130 and won the [[Super Bowl VII]] 14\u20137 over the [[1972 Washington Redskins season|Washington Redskins]]. Shula's 1973 team repeated as NFL champions, winning the 1974 Super Bowl over the Minnesota Vikings. The following season, the Dolphins had a chance to win a third title in three years, but they fell to the Oakland Raiders 28\u201326, in an AFC divisional playoff game in one of the more popular playoff games ever played. With 35 seconds remaining in the game, [[Ken Stabler]] was in the process of being sacked by [[Vern Den Herder]]. Just before he was tackled, he threw a completed desperation forward pass to his running back Clarence Davis in the game's final moments, and in doing so, ended Miami's two-year dominance. The Dolphins team was decimated the following season by the creation of the now defunct [[World Football League]] and their inability to match contract offers to three of its star players\u2014Larry Csonka, Jim Kiick, and Paul Warfield\u2014to the rival league. The Dolphin franchise has never been able to duplicate the success of 1971\u201374.\n\nOver the years, Shula's relationship with Robbie chilled considerably, in part due to Robbie's unwillingness to spend money on higher-profile players. Despite this, one of the few times he came close to leaving Miami came in the middle of the 1983 season, when [[Donald Trump]], the new owner of the upstart [[United States Football League]]'s [[New Jersey Generals]], offered him a $5 million contract\u2013a significant increase from the $400,000 he was earning at the time with the Dolphins. Negotiations hit a snag when Shula insisted on getting a rent-free apartment at [[Trump Tower]]. When Trump publicly announced the deal was all but done except for the apartment agreement, Shula broke off talks and stayed in Miami. Years later, Csonka, by then an executive with the [[Jacksonville Bulls]], said that he believed Shula would have taken the job, but was angered at being \"thrown out to the press\" by Trump.<ref name=Buck>{{cite book|title=Football For A Buck: The Crazy Rise and Crazier Demise of the USFL|last=Pearlman|first=Jeff|authorlink=Jeff Pearlman|publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt]]|date=2018|isbn=978-0544454385}}</ref>\n\n==Later life==\n\n[[File:Shula's Steakhouse Matchbook.JPG|thumb|Matchbook from Shula's Steakhouse in Indianapolis, Indiana, ''circa'' 1990]]\nIn retirement, Shula has lent his name to a chain of [[steakhouse]]s, Shula's Steakhouse,<ref>[http://www.donshula.com/ Shula's]</ref> and a line of condiments.<ref>[http://www.donshula.com/store.php Shula's Online Store] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070127215132/http://www.donshula.com/store.php |date=January 27, 2007 }}</ref> He appeared in [[NutriSystem]] commercials with [[Dan Marino]] and other former NFL players.\n\nShula also has a hotel in Miami Lakes, Florida, which is home to the Original Shula's Steak House, The Senator Course at Shula's Golf Club, The Spa at Shula's, and Shula's Athletic Club.

He is the all-time leader in victories with 347. He is first in most games coached (526), most consecutive seasons coached (33), and Super Bowl losses (four, tied with [[Bud Grant]], [[Dan Reeves]], and [[Marv Levy]]). His teams won seven NFL conference titles: 1964, 1968, 1971\u201373, 1982, and 1984. Shula's teams were consistently among the least penalized in the NFL, and Shula served on the Rules Committee, to help change the game to a more pass-oriented league. He had a winning record against almost every coach he faced, with several exceptions: Levy, against whom he was 5\u201314 during the regular season and 0\u20133 in the playoffs; John Madden, against whom he was 2\u20132 in the regular season and 1\u20132 in the playoffs for a total of 3\u20134; and Bill Cowher, against whom Shula was 1\u20132 late in his career. Don Shula also had losing records against Tom Flores(1-6) Raymond Berry (3-8), Walt Michaels (5-7-1), and Vince Lombardi (5-8).\n\nShula also holds the distinction of having coached five different quarterbacks to Super Bowl appearances ([[Johnny Unitas]] and [[Earl Morrall]] in 1968, [[Bob Griese]] in 1971, 1972, and 1973, [[David Woodley]] in 1982, and [[Dan Marino]] in 1984), three of them (Unitas, Griese, and Marino) future Hall of Famers. He also coached Johnny Unitas to another World Championship appearance (in the pre-Super Bowl era) in 1964. The only other NFL coach to approach this distinction is [[Joe Gibbs]], who coached four Super Bowls with three different quarterbacks ([[Joe Theismann]], [[Doug Williams (American football)|Doug Williams]], and [[Mark Rypien]]), winning three times.\n\nShula is honored at the Don Shula Stadium at John Carroll University, and the [[Don Shula Expressway]] in Miami. An annual college football game between [[South Florida]] schools [[Florida Atlantic Owls football|Florida Atlantic University]] and [[FIU Golden Panthers football|Florida International University]] is named the [[Shula Bowl]] in his honor. The game's winner receives a traveling trophy named the [[Don Shula Award]]. On January 31, 2010, a statue of him was unveiled at [[Hard Rock Stadium]].\n\n==Writings==\n\nHe has co-authored three books: ''The Winning Edge'' (1973) with Lou Sahadi {{ISBN|0-525-23500-0}}, ''Everyone's a Coach'' (1995) {{ISBN|0-310-20815-7}}, and ''The Little Black Book of Coaching: Motivating People to be Winners'' (2001); {{ISBN|0-06-662103-8}}, both with Ken Blanchard (author of The One Minute Manager).\n\n==Head coaching record==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\"|Team !! rowspan=\"2\"|Year !! colspan=\"5\"|Regular season !! colspan=\"4\"|Postseason\n|-\n!Won!!Lost!!Ties!!Win %!!Finish!!

The winningest coach in [[National Football League]] (NFL) history, Shula is best known for his time being the longtime head coach of the [[Miami Dolphins]], leading them to two [[Super Bowl]] victories, as well as the [[1972 Miami Dolphins season|only perfect season]] in NFL history. He was previously the head coach of the [[Baltimore Colts]], with whom he won the [[1968 NFL Championship Game|1968 NFL Championship]]. Shula was drafted out of [[John Carroll Blue Streaks football|John Carroll University]] in the [[1951 NFL Draft]], and he played professionally as a [[defensive back]] for the [[Cleveland Browns]], [[Baltimore Colts]], and [[Washington Redskins]].\n\nShula was named 1993 [[Sportsman of the Year]] by ''[[Sports Illustrated]]''. He had only two losing seasons in his 33-year career as a head coach in the NFL. He led his teams to six Super Bowls. In [[Super Bowl III]], his first, the [[1968 Baltimore Colts season|Colts]] set the record for the longest period to be [[shut out]], not scoring until 3:19 remained in the game, which was later broken in [[Super Bowl VII]]. At [[Super Bowl VI|his next Super Bowl]], the [[1971 Miami Dolphins season|Dolphins]] set the Super Bowl record for the lowest points scored by any team, with one field goal. The [[Super Bowl VII|following year]], he coached a [[perfect season]] and broke the record of longest shutout, this time with his team on the winning side, not giving up any points until 2:07 remained. The Dolphins [[Super Bowl VIII|repeated]] as Super Bowl champions the following season, as they defeated the [[Minnesota Vikings]] 24\u20137. He holds the NFL record for most career wins as a head coach with 347 (328 in the regular season). Shula was inducted into the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] in 1997.\n\n==Early life and college==\nShula was born on January 4, 1930 in [[Grand River, Ohio]], a small town along the [[Lake Erie]] shore in the northeastern part of the state.<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.upi.com/Top_News/2019/01/04/UPI-Almanac-for-Friday-Jan-4-2019/5471546221584/|title=UPI Almanac for Friday, Jan. 4, 2019|agency=[[United Press International]]|date=January 4, 2019|accessdate=September 4, 2019|archivedate=January 5, 2019 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20190105012355/http://www.upi.com/Top_News/2019/01/04/UPI-Almanac-for-Friday-Jan-4-2019/5471546221584/|url-status=live|quote=Pro Football Hall of Fame coach and player Don Shula in 1930 (age 89)}}</ref><ref name=\"News-Herald article\">{{cite news |last=Schudel |first=Jeff |title=Don Shula at 80: From Harvey to Hall |url=http://www.news-herald.com/general-news/20100718/don-shula-at-80-from-harvey-to-hall-with-slideshow-video |accessdate=November 2, 2013 |newspaper=The News-Herald |date=August 9, 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103234608/http://www.news-herald.com/general-news/20100718/don-shula-at-80-from-harvey-to-hall-with-slideshow-video |archivedate=November 3, 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> His parents, Dan and Mary, were of Hungarian origin, having immigrated when they were children.<ref name=\"Shula's Roots story\">{{cite news |title=Shula's Roots \u2013 A Rock Foundation |url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1993-11-15/sports/9311150043_1_shula-s-roots-shula-s-foundation-hometown |accessdate=November 2, 2013 |newspaper=Sun-Sentinel |date=November 15, 1993 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103200841/http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1993-11-15/sports/9311150043_1_shula-s-roots-shula-s-foundation-hometown |archivedate=November 3, 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Shula's father Dan worked for $9 a week at a rose nursery and saved up to buy the small house where Shula spent his early childhood.<ref name=\"Shula's Roots story\" /> The house was next door to a grocery store in Grand River owned by Mary's parents.<ref name=\"Shula's Roots story\" /> Shula played football in his neighborhood as a child, but his parents forbade it after he got a gash on his face when he was 11.<ref name=\"News-Herald article\" />\n\nAs Shula's family expanded\u2014he had six siblings, including a set of triplets born in 1936\u2014his father got a job in the local fishing industry for $15 a week, and later worked at a [[rayon]] plant in nearby [[Painesville, Ohio]].<ref name=\"Shula's Roots story\" /> Shula attended elementary school at St. Mary's, a private [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] school in Painesville; his mother was a devout Catholic, and his father converted to that denomination when they married.<ref name=\"Shula's Roots story\" /> He later attended [[Thomas W.

New York won the game 16\u20137.<ref name=\"1968 NFL stats\" />\n\nShula spent one more season as the head coach of the 8-5-1 Colts, and missed the playoffs. He compiled a 71\u201323\u20134 record in seven seasons with Baltimore, but was just 2\u20133 in the postseason, including upset losses in the [[1964 NFL Championship Game]] and Super Bowl III, where the Colts were heavy favorites.\n\n===Miami Dolphins (1970\u20131995)===\n\nAfter the [[1969 NFL season|1969]] season, [[Joe Robbie]], owner of the [[Miami Dolphins]], signed Shula to a contract to become Miami's second head coach. As a result of Shula's signing, the team was charged with [[Tampering (sport)|tampering]] by the NFL, which forced the Dolphins to give their first-round pick to the Colts.<ref>[http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1084265/index.htm Olsen, Jack. \"The Rosenbloom-Robbie Bowl\", ''Sports Illustrated'', November 9, 1970.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725123948/http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1084265/index.htm |date=July 25, 2008 }}</ref> The decision was controversial because Shula and Robbie's negotiations and signing were conducted before and after the official [[AFL-NFL Merger|NFL/AFL merger]], respectively. Had the negotiations been concluded before the merger, while the NFL and AFL were rivals, the NFL's antitampering rules could not have been applied.\n\nShula's Miami teams were known for great offensive lines (led by [[Larry Little]], [[Jim Langer]], and [[Bob Kuechenberg]]), strong running games (featuring [[Larry Csonka]], [[Jim Kiick]], and [[Mercury Morris]]), solid quarterbacking (by [[Bob Griese]] and [[Earl Morrall]]), excellent receivers (in [[Paul Warfield]], [[Howard Twilley]], and TE [[Jim Mandich]]) and a defense that worked well as a cohesive unit. The Dolphins were known as \"The No-Name Defense\", though they had a number of great players, including DT [[Manny Fernandez (American football)|Manny Fernandez]] and MLB [[Nick Buoniconti]].<ref>[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/edb/reader.html?magID=SI&issueDate=19720110&mode=reader_vault Underwood, John. \"Two That Were Super\", ''Sports Illustrated'', January 10, 1972.]</ref>\n\nIn 1972, the Dolphins were unbeaten in the regular season, 14\u20130\u20130. They swept the playoffs and finished [[Perfect season#The Perfect Season|17\u20130\u20130]].\n\nShula changed his coaching strategy as his personnel changed. His Super Bowl teams in [[1971 Miami Dolphins season|1971]], [[1972 Miami Dolphins season|1972]], [[1973 Miami Dolphins season|1973]], and [[1982 Miami Dolphins season|1982]] were keyed by a run-first offensive strategy and a dominating defense. In [[1983 NFL Draft|1983]], shortly after losing [[Super Bowl XVII]] to the [[1982 Washington Redskins season|Washington Redskins]], the Dolphins drafted quarterback [[Dan Marino]] out of the [[Pittsburgh Panthers football|University of Pittsburgh]]. Marino won the starting job halfway through the [[1983 NFL season|1983 regular season]], and by [[1984 NFL season|1984]], the Dolphins were back in the [[Super Bowl XIX|Super Bowl]], due largely to Marino's record 5,084 yards through the air and 48 touchdown passes.\n\nIn addition to his well-documented regular season success, Don Shula also achieved historical heights in the post season as well.  The Dolphins' January, 1974 Super Bowl win over the Minnesota Vikings proved to be Shula's second NFL championship following the only perfect season in NFL history.  His six total Super Bowl appearances as a Head Coach was the most ever at the time of his retirement in 1995 and today ranks as second all time.  Don Shula also holds the unique distinction as the first of only three NFL head coaches to take the same NFL team to three, or more, consecutive Super Bowls. Don Shula was also the 2nd of only 13 all-time NFL head coaches to win two or more Super Bowls.  His post season success is highlighted by the fact that six of the first nineteen Super Bowls had Don Shula prowling the sidelines as a Head Coach for the Colts and Dolphins.  Despite not having coached in over 25 years, Don Shula today is second all time in AFC Championship Game appearances with seven, and third all-time with 19 post season wins.  \n\nHis retirement following the 1995 regular season ended one of the greatest coaching legacies in NFL history. He set numerous records in his 33 seasons as a head coach. He is first in most games coached (526) and most consecutive seasons coached (33). Shula won two Super Bowls while also being the first head coach to coach the same team to three consecutive Super Bowls.  Shula remains the only NFL coach to achieve NFL perfection.\n\nShula was the head coach of the [[1972 Miami Dolphins season|1972 Miami Dolphins]], which finished a perfect 17\u20130 and won the [[Super Bowl VII]] 14\u20137 over the [[1972 Washington Redskins season|Washington Redskins]]. Shula's 1973 team repeated as NFL champions, winning the 1974 Super Bowl over the Minnesota Vikings. The following season, the Dolphins had a chance to win a third title in three years, but they fell to the Oakland Raiders 28\u201326, in an AFC divisional playoff game in one of the more popular playoff games ever played. With 35 seconds remaining in the game, [[Ken Stabler]] was in the process of being sacked by [[Vern Den Herder]]. Just before he was tackled, he threw a completed desperation forward pass to his running back Clarence Davis in the game's final moments, and in doing so, ended Miami's two-year dominance. The Dolphins team was decimated the following season by the creation of the now defunct [[World Football League]] and their inability to match contract offers to three of its star players\u2014Larry Csonka, Jim Kiick, and Paul Warfield\u2014to the rival league. The Dolphin franchise has never been able to duplicate the success of 1971\u201374.\n\nOver the years, Shula's relationship with Robbie chilled considerably, in part due to Robbie's unwillingness to spend money on higher-profile players. Despite this, one of the few times he came close to leaving Miami came in the middle of the 1983 season, when [[Donald Trump]], the new owner of the upstart [[United States Football League]]'s [[New Jersey Generals]], offered him a $5 million contract\u2013a significant increase from the $400,000 he was earning at the time with the Dolphins. Negotiations hit a snag when Shula insisted on getting a rent-free apartment at [[Trump Tower]]. When Trump publicly announced the deal was all but done except for the apartment agreement, Shula broke off talks and stayed in Miami. Years later, Csonka, by then an executive with the [[Jacksonville Bulls]], said that he believed Shula would have taken the job, but was angered at being \"thrown out to the press\" by Trump.<ref name=Buck>{{cite book|title=Football For A Buck: The Crazy Rise and Crazier Demise of the USFL|last=Pearlman|first=Jeff|authorlink=Jeff Pearlman|publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt]]|date=2018|isbn=978-0544454385}}</ref>\n\n==Later life==\n\n[[File:Shula's Steakhouse Matchbook.JPG|thumb|Matchbook from Shula's Steakhouse in Indianapolis, Indiana, ''circa'' 1990]]\nIn retirement, Shula has lent his name to a chain of [[steakhouse]]s, Shula's Steakhouse,<ref>[http://www.donshula.com/ Shula's]</ref> and a line of condiments.<ref>[http://www.donshula.com/store.php Shula's Online Store] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070127215132/http://www.donshula.com/store.php |date=January 27, 2007 }}</ref> He appeared in [[NutriSystem]] commercials with [[Dan Marino]] and other former NFL players.\n\nShula also has a hotel in Miami Lakes, Florida, which is home to the Original Shula's Steak House, The Senator Course at Shula's Golf Club, The Spa at Shula's, and Shula's Athletic Club.

He is the all-time leader in victories with 347. He is first in most games coached (526), most consecutive seasons coached (33), and Super Bowl losses (four, tied with [[Bud Grant]], [[Dan Reeves]], and [[Marv Levy]]). His teams won seven NFL conference titles: 1964, 1968, 1971\u201373, 1982, and 1984. Shula's teams were consistently among the least penalized in the NFL, and Shula served on the Rules Committee, to help change the game to a more pass-oriented league. He had a winning record against almost every coach he faced, with several exceptions: Levy, against whom he was 5\u201314 during the regular season and 0\u20133 in the playoffs; John Madden, against whom he was 2\u20132 in the regular season and 1\u20132 in the playoffs for a total of 3\u20134; and Bill Cowher, against whom Shula was 1\u20132 late in his career. Don Shula also had losing records against Tom Flores(1-6) Raymond Berry (3-8), Walt Michaels (5-7-1), and Vince Lombardi (5-8).\n\nShula also holds the distinction of having coached five different quarterbacks to Super Bowl appearances ([[Johnny Unitas]] and [[Earl Morrall]] in 1968, [[Bob Griese]] in 1971, 1972, and 1973, [[David Woodley]] in 1982, and [[Dan Marino]] in 1984), three of them (Unitas, Griese, and Marino) future Hall of Famers. He also coached Johnny Unitas to another World Championship appearance (in the pre-Super Bowl era) in 1964. The only other NFL coach to approach this distinction is [[Joe Gibbs]], who coached four Super Bowls with three different quarterbacks ([[Joe Theismann]], [[Doug Williams (American football)|Doug Williams]], and [[Mark Rypien]]), winning three times.\n\nShula is honored at the Don Shula Stadium at John Carroll University, and the [[Don Shula Expressway]] in Miami. An annual college football game between [[South Florida]] schools [[Florida Atlantic Owls football|Florida Atlantic University]] and [[FIU Golden Panthers football|Florida International University]] is named the [[Shula Bowl]] in his honor. The game's winner receives a traveling trophy named the [[Don Shula Award]].
