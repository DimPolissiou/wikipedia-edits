It is {{convert|270|km|abbr=on}} northeast of [[Vancouver]]. Situated at the confluence of the [[Nicola River|Nicola]] and [[Coldwater River (British Columbia)|Coldwater]] rivers, it is the first major community encountered after travelling along [[British Columbia Highway 5|Phase One of the Coquihalla Highway]] and acts as the gateway to all other major highways to the B.C. Interior. The city developed in 1893 when part of the ranches owned by William Voght, Jesus Garcia, and John Charters were surveyed for a town site.<ref name=history>{{Cite book|editor=Nicola Valley Museum Archives Association|title=Merritt & The Nicola Valley: An Illustrated History|year=1998|publisher=Sonotek Publishing|location=Merritt, BC|pages=32\u201337|isbn=0-929069-11-0 }}</ref>\n\nOnce known as Forksdale, the community adopted its current name in 1906 in honour of mining engineer and railway promoter [[William Hamilton Merritt III]].<ref name=\"akrigg\">Akrigg, Helen B. and Akrigg, G.P.V; 1001 British Columbia Place Names; Discovery Press, Vancouver 1969, 1970, 1973, p. 114</ref> The {{convert|24|km2|adj=on}} city limits consist of the community, a number of civic parks, historical sites, an aquatic centre, a local arena, a public library (which is a branch of the Thompson-Nicola Regional District Library System) and a civic centre. Merritt has dozens of bronzed hand prints of country music stars who have been in the city for the annual [[Merritt Mountain Music Festival]] displayed throughout town. Merritt is also home to a local radio station, a weekly newspaper and the [[Nicola Valley Institute of Technology]] campus. Nearby, there are four [[List of British Columbia Provincial Parks|provincial park]]s, numerous lakes, and several recreational trails. Merritt is known as the \"Country Music Capital of Canada\" for its wealth of country music attractions, activities, and events.\n\n[[British Columbia Highway 5|Highway 5]], and [[British Columbia Highway 97C|Highway 97C]] intersect at Merritt with [[British Columbia Highway 97C|Highway 97C]] East connecting the city to [[Kelowna]] and [[Penticton]], [[British Columbia Highway 97C|Highway 97C]] Northwest to [[Logan Lake, British Columbia|Logan Lake]], [[British Columbia Highway 8|Highway 8]] to [[Spences Bridge, British Columbia|Spences Bridge]] and [[Lillooet, British Columbia|Lillooet]], [[British Columbia Highway 5A|Highway 5A]] South to [[Princeton, British Columbia|Princeton]], [[British Columbia Highway 5A|Highway 5A]] North to [[Kamloops]], [[British Columbia Highway 5|Highway 5]] South to [[Hope, British Columbia|Hope]], and [[British Columbia Highway 5|Highway 5]] North to [[Kamloops]]. Merritt's economy is dominated by the primary industries of forestry, tourism, and service.\n\n== History ==\n\nFor years, the Merritt area was a gathering place for local European colonists and [[First Nations]], as the area was a focus of transportation routes used by early [[settler|pioneers]]. The grasslands eventually drew the attention of settlers interested in [[ranching]], and the first ranches were staked in the mid-19th century.\n\nIn the 1880s three ranches located at the confluence of the [[Nicola River|Nicola]] and [[Coldwater River (British Columbia)|Coldwater River]]s, owned by William Voght, Jesus Garcia, and the John Charters Estate, became the focus of a farming community known as \"The Forks\". With the completion of the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] through [[British Columbia]] in 1885, interest increased in the [[coal]] deposits south of The Forks.\n\nParts of the ranches owned by Voght, Garcia and Charters were surveyed in 1893 for the townsite of Forksdale, but the name did not catch on with locals. Instead, the name was changed in 1906 to honour [[William Hamilton Merritt III]], a mining engineer and railway promoter. By 1907, the [[coal]] mines were in operation and with the completion of the railway from [[Spences Bridge]], government and other offices starting moving from [[Lower Nicola|Lower]] and [[Upper Nicola Band|Upper Nicola]] to establish Merritt as the major settlement in the [[Nicola Valley]].\n\nArmstrong's Store moved from Lower Nicola to Nicola Avenue in Merritt in the spring of 1907. G.B. Armstrong became Merritt's first [[postmaster]] at this location in 1908. In 1910, Armstrong's Department Store moved to 2025 Quilchena Avenue. In 1909, the [[Bank of Montreal]] moved from the settlement of Nicola to Merritt. A.E. Howse moved his department store to the west end of Nicola Avenue. The ''Nicola Herald'', founded at Nicola Lake in 1905, moved from Nicola to Merritt in 1909 and the name was changed to the ''[[Merritt Herald]] and Nicola Valley Advocate''. Other industries developed in the [[Nicola Valley|Valley]], including [[ranching]], copper, nickel, gold and silver mining, and [[forestry]], and as a result, new business buildings were constructed.\n\nThe move toward incorporation began in 1910 and culminated on April 1, 1911 when Merritt was granted its city charter. The first Merritt [[City Hall]] was built in 1912. The top floor was police headquarters, the second for administration offices, and the bottom for the jail. The building included the fire hall and tower that housed a whistle to summon the [[volunteer fire department|volunteer fire fighters]].\n\nMerritt dedicated the names of its streets and avenues to early settlers. Among the names honoured were Charters, Chapman, Cleasby, Garcia, Voght, Coutlee, Nicola, Granite, and Quilchena.\n\nAs the town grew, it featured a drug store, a general store, a brewery and a jewellery store. The first electrical power service by the city was provided in February 1913.\n\nMerritt and the Nicola Valley experienced prosperity until the passage of restrictive trade legislation in the United States in 1930. Because the city had financially backed one of the major sawmills, the loss of lumber markets caused the city to go into receivership from 1933 to 1952.<ref name=\"history\"/>\n\nThe next wave of immigrants, primarily [[Sikh]], from the [[Punjab region]] of India, arrived in Merritt in the 1950s, followed by a large influx in the late 1960s and early 1970s to work in the booming forestry sector of the time and adding to the cultural mosaic of Merritt. Known as [[Indo-Canadians]], they continue to play a crucial part in the economy\u2014Aspen Planers Ltd., a major employer in the city, and many other businesses, restaurants and hotels in Merritt are owned by members of this group.<ref>{{Cite book|editor=SFU Archives|url=http://aabc.bc.ca/access/aabc/archbc/display/SFU-143}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nIn advance polls during the 2015 Canadian elections, an unexpectedly high turnout in Merritt resulted in there being an insufficient quantity of ballots.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/kamloops/democracy-watch-calls-for-audit-after-voting-mix-ups-1.3270400|title=Democracy Watch calls for audit after voting mix-ups - CBC News|author=|date=|website=cbc.ca|accessdate=19 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\n[[File:Merritt-panorama.jpg|right|300px|thumb|Merritt in winter]]\nMerritt is composed of four distinct residential areas: Bench, Collettville, Central and Diamondvale.

Collettville, on the southwest edge of the community south of the Coldwater River, was the newest addition to Merritt. Central is situated at the south of the city centre. Diamond Vale is in the heart of the valley, and is the most populated. Each area is served by an elementary school: [[Merritt Bench Elementary School|Bench Elementary]], [[Collettville Elementary School|Collettville Elementary and French Immersion]], [[Merritt Central Elementary School|Central Elementary]], [[Diamond Vale Elementary School|Diamond Vale Elementary]].

It is {{convert|270|km|abbr=on}} northeast of [[Vancouver]]. Situated at the confluence of the [[Nicola River|Nicola]] and [[Coldwater River (British Columbia)|Coldwater]] rivers, it is the first major community encountered after travelling along [[British Columbia Highway 5|Phase One of the Coquihalla Highway]] and acts as the gateway to all other major highways to the B.C. Interior. The city developed in 1893 when part of the ranches owned by William Voght, Jesus Garcia, and John Charters were surveyed for a town site.<ref name=history>{{Cite book|editor=Nicola Valley Museum Archives Association|title=Merritt & The Nicola Valley: An Illustrated History|year=1998|publisher=Sonotek Publishing|location=Merritt, BC|pages=32\u201337|isbn=0-929069-11-0 }}</ref>\n\nOnce known as Forksdale, the community adopted its current name in 1906 in honour of mining engineer and railway promoter [[William Hamilton Merritt III]].<ref name=\"akrigg\">Akrigg, Helen B. and Akrigg, G.P.V; 1001 British Columbia Place Names; Discovery Press, Vancouver 1969, 1970, 1973, p. 114</ref> The {{convert|24|km2|adj=on}} city limits consist of the community, a number of civic parks, historical sites, an aquatic centre, a local arena, a public library (which is a branch of the Thompson-Nicola Regional District Library System) and a civic centre. Merritt has dozens of bronzed hand prints of country music stars who have been in the city for the annual [[Merritt Mountain Music Festival]] displayed throughout town. Merritt is also home to a local radio station, a weekly newspaper and the [[Nicola Valley Institute of Technology]] campus. Nearby, there are four [[List of British Columbia Provincial Parks|provincial park]]s, numerous lakes, and several recreational trails. Merritt is known as the \"Country Music Capital of Canada\" for its wealth of country music attractions, activities, and events.\n\n[[British Columbia Highway 5|Highway 5]], and [[British Columbia Highway 97C|Highway 97C]] intersect at Merritt with [[British Columbia Highway 97C|Highway 97C]] East connecting the city to [[Kelowna]] and [[Penticton]], [[British Columbia Highway 97C|Highway 97C]] Northwest to [[Logan Lake, British Columbia|Logan Lake]], [[British Columbia Highway 8|Highway 8]] to [[Spences Bridge, British Columbia|Spences Bridge]] and [[Lillooet, British Columbia|Lillooet]], [[British Columbia Highway 5A|Highway 5A]] South to [[Princeton, British Columbia|Princeton]], [[British Columbia Highway 5A|Highway 5A]] North to [[Kamloops]], [[British Columbia Highway 5|Highway 5]] South to [[Hope, British Columbia|Hope]], and [[British Columbia Highway 5|Highway 5]] North to [[Kamloops]]. Merritt's economy is dominated by the primary industries of forestry, tourism, and service.\n\n== History ==\n\nFor years, the Merritt area was a gathering place for local European colonists and [[First Nations]], as the area was a focus of transportation routes used by early [[settler|pioneers]]. The grasslands eventually drew the attention of settlers interested in [[ranching]], and the first ranches were staked in the mid-19th century.\n\nIn the 1880s three ranches located at the confluence of the [[Nicola River|Nicola]] and [[Coldwater River (British Columbia)|Coldwater River]]s, owned by William Voght, Jesus Garcia, and the John Charters Estate, became the focus of a farming community known as \"The Forks\". With the completion of the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] through [[British Columbia]] in 1885, interest increased in the [[coal]] deposits south of The Forks.\n\nParts of the ranches owned by Voght, Garcia and Charters were surveyed in 1893 for the townsite of Forksdale, but the name did not catch on with locals. Instead, the name was changed in 1906 to honour [[William Hamilton Merritt III]], a mining engineer and railway promoter. By 1907, the [[coal]] mines were in operation and with the completion of the railway from [[Spences Bridge]], government and other offices starting moving from [[Lower Nicola|Lower]] and [[Upper Nicola Band|Upper Nicola]] to establish Merritt as the major settlement in the [[Nicola Valley]].\n\nArmstrong's Store moved from Lower Nicola to Nicola Avenue in Merritt in the spring of 1907. G.B. Armstrong became Merritt's first [[postmaster]] at this location in 1908. In 1910, Armstrong's Department Store moved to 2025 Quilchena Avenue. In 1909, the [[Bank of Montreal]] moved from the settlement of Nicola to Merritt. A.E. Howse moved his department store to the west end of Nicola Avenue. The ''Nicola Herald'', founded at Nicola Lake in 1905, moved from Nicola to Merritt in 1909 and the name was changed to the ''[[Merritt Herald]] and Nicola Valley Advocate''. Other industries developed in the [[Nicola Valley|Valley]], including [[ranching]], copper, nickel, gold and silver mining, and [[forestry]], and as a result, new business buildings were constructed.\n\nThe move toward incorporation began in 1910 and culminated on April 1, 1911 when Merritt was granted its city charter. The first Merritt [[City Hall]] was built in 1912. The top floor was police headquarters, the second for administration offices, and the bottom for the jail. The building included the fire hall and tower that housed a whistle to summon the [[volunteer fire department|volunteer fire fighters]].\n\nMerritt dedicated the names of its streets and avenues to early settlers. Among the names honoured were Charters, Chapman, Cleasby, Garcia, Voght, Coutlee, Nicola, Granite, and Quilchena.\n\nAs the town grew, it featured a drug store, a general store, a brewery and a jewellery store. The first electrical power service by the city was provided in February 1913.\n\nMerritt and the Nicola Valley experienced prosperity until the passage of restrictive trade legislation in the United States in 1930. Because the city had financially backed one of the major sawmills, the loss of lumber markets caused the city to go into receivership from 1933 to 1952.<ref name=\"history\"/>\n\nThe next wave of immigrants, primarily [[Sikh]], from the [[Punjab region]] of India, arrived in Merritt in the 1950s, followed by a large influx in the late 1960s and early 1970s to work in the booming forestry sector of the time and adding to the cultural mosaic of Merritt. Known as [[Indo-Canadians]], they continue to play a crucial part in the economy\u2014Aspen Planers Ltd., a major employer in the city, and many other businesses, restaurants and hotels in Merritt are owned by members of this group.<ref>{{Cite book|editor=SFU Archives|url=http://aabc.bc.ca/access/aabc/archbc/display/SFU-143}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nIn advance polls during the 2015 Canadian elections, an unexpectedly high turnout in Merritt resulted in there being an insufficient quantity of ballots.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/kamloops/democracy-watch-calls-for-audit-after-voting-mix-ups-1.3270400|title=Democracy Watch calls for audit after voting mix-ups - CBC News|author=|date=|website=cbc.ca|accessdate=19 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\n[[File:Merritt-panorama.jpg|right|300px|thumb|Merritt in winter]]\nMerritt is composed of four distinct residential areas: Bench, Collettville, Central and Diamondvale. The Bench is a residential mountain bench, hence the name, sited on the northwest side of the valley. Collettville, on the southwest edge of the community south of the Coldwater River, was the newest addition to Merritt. Central is situated at the south of the city centre. Diamond Vale is in the heart of the valley, and is the most populated. Each area is served by an elementary school: [[Merritt Bench Elementary School|Bench Elementary]], [[Collettville Elementary School|Collettville Elementary and French Immersion]], [[Merritt Central Elementary School|Central Elementary]], [[Diamond Vale Elementary School|Diamond Vale Elementary]]. Also, a high school, [[Merritt Secondary School]], that services the area. The main office for [[School District 58 Nicola-Similkameen]], which operates the schools in the area, is also located in Merritt. The town is also served by the [[Nicola Valley Museum and Archives]].\n\n== Commerce and industry ==\n\nToday, [[ranching]], [[farming]], [[forestry]], [[transport]]ation and [[tourism]] are the primary [[industry|industries]]. Merritt is the nearest large community to the [[Douglas Lake Cattle Company]], Canada's largest working cattle ranch.\n\nMerritt was once host to an annual [[Merritt Mountain Music Festival]] that is estimated to have drawn as many as 148,000 people at its peak in the summer of 2005. The Mountain Music Festival, combined with the development of the Merritt Walk of Stars - a display of bronzed handprints of Mountainfest artists placed around the community - the Mural Project, designed by artist [[Michelle Loughery]]{{citation needed|date=February 2019}} , the Canadian Country Music Hall of Fame, Music in the Square and in the Park along with other tourism development activities have been used to solidify the city's branding as the Country Music Capital of Canada.\n\nMerritt's prime location has provided the opportunity to host many events, the West Coast Rally Association's Pacific Forest Rally, an off-road rally conducted as part of the Canadian Rally Championship series every October, also the annual winter Thunderbird Rally often begins and ends in Merritt. The Bass Coast Festival held annually on the BC Day weekend and supports electronic music and creative arts draws attendees from all over North America.

[[Jack Nicholson]]'s ''[[The Pledge (film)|The Pledge]]'' and the 2006 remake of ''[[The Wicker Man (2006 film)|The Wicker Man]]'' were also filmed partly in the area. In 2013 ''[[Shana: The Wolf's Music]]'' directed by Nino Jacusso was released, it is a drama about a First Nations girl coming of age set in a First Nations location. The Nicola Valley is also host to the shooting of numerous commercials. Merritt is a member of the Thompson-Nicola Film Commission, which is a full-time, full service film commission representing the Thompson Nicola Regional District.\n\n== Music ==\n\nThe Merritt Mountain Music Festival was an outdoor music festival in Merritt. In 2005 the festival hosted a record-breaking attendance of approximately 148,000 people throughout the six-day event.

She wrote \"''God help them! Poor creatures! I have not filled my mouth once but I have thought of them.''\"<ref>Begg, p.37</ref> In 1843 she wrote to Isobel Begg nee Burns recalling that she had named her children James and Sarah at the behest of [[Jean Armour]] and that in 1833 Jean had sent her \u00a32 to purchase a frock for her youngest child. The letter to Isobel dated from after Jean's death and in it she was highly complimentary about Jean, the lady who had raised her.<ref>Begg, p.75</ref> Saying that she was \"''a woman whose memory I will ever cherish with fond remembrance for her many good qualities, but more especially for the prudent and motherly manner she always conducted herself towards me. The more I live the more I admire her character the more.''\"<ref name=\"Mc\">McCallum p.26</ref>\n\nShe felt that the Burns family did not accept her, most notably through her exclusion from the Burns Festival in Ayr of 1844.<ref>Westwood, p.178</ref> Significantly her son Robert was rejected upon trying to greet his father's sons, his uncles, at the Ayr Festival.<ref>Westwood, p.180</ref> She stated that her 'unfortunate' birth was the greatest stain by far on her father's character.<ref name=\"pw\"/>\n\nBrown records that two of Anna's grandsons were however feted at the 1859 Glasgow Anniversary Celebrations held at the King's Arms Hall in the Trongate,<ref>Brown, p.109</ref> being the sons therefore of her daughter Betty and John Thomson.

It was published in 11 volumes between 2000 and 2010. The series was adapted into a 3-episode [[original video animation]] series in 2007. A film version of the OVA aired in the [[United States]] on the [[Syfy]] channel.\n\n==Plot==\n''Strait Jacket'' is set an [[alternate history]] where [[Magic in fiction|magic]] was proven to exist in the year 1899. The use of sorcery spread throughout all facets of society and changed the social and technological development of the world. The location is Tristan, an [[Urban area|urban]] [[metropolis]] that appears to be an amalgamation of turn-of-the-20th-century [[Tokyo]], [[San Francisco]], and [[Victorian era|Victorian-era]] [[London]].\n\nAlongside this technology and science exists magic, which has been proven possible in public demonstrations by Dr. George Greco. Although the use of magic is only possible for a few talented individuals, it is very dangerous and highly illegal. Due to an invisible contaminant called the \"malediction\", or simply the \"[[curse]]\", people who use magic too often are at risk in transforming into \"[[Demon]]s\", or horrific, malevolent abominations of nature that become immune to ordinary weapons. The Magic Administration Bureau, also known as the [[Magic (supernatural)|Sorcery]] Management Bureau, is set up in the attempt to safely explore the nature of magic, officially document it, attempt to provide rational scientific explanation for it, regulate its use and police those who use magic illegally. Magic, utilized in a safe sense by the Bureau, has been used as a viable energy source by the civil service, industry, agriculture, medicine, and the military. Effectively, the Magic Administration Bureau is now in control of every field and every facet of society.\n\nThe primary enemies of the Bureau are Oddman, a former left-wing terrorist cell, turned mercenary. All of these magic users, even the ones with innocent and well-meaning intentions, are in danger of tapping into the dark side either accidentally or on purpose and themselves becoming bloodthirsty beasts due to accidents or sabotage by Oddman's agents. These Sorcerist agents wear a suit of armor that resists the negative transforming effects of magic. These suits are referred to as \"Mold Armor\", or more commonly a \"[[straitjacket]]\", due to the fact they constrain human beings in their natural form. The Sorcerists also use magically-tainted bullets from large hand-carried railguns powered by a combination of steam and magic, which are the only weapons capable of effectively stopping the magically-transformed monsters.\n\nHowever, the over-stretched Bureau is steadily losing ground and increasingly must rely on outside help. There simply aren't enough Sorcerists to fight the Demons caused by Oddman's sabotage. This deliberate sabotage leads to an increase in accidental demonic transformations and attacks on the public across Tristan. Among those who fight the Demons is an unlicensed, rogue Sorcerist named Leiot Steinberg, who is viewed as a loose cannon bringing the name of Sorcerists into disrepute and causing as much damage as the Demons in his one-man war against them. Yet the Bureau is forced to reluctantly call upon his services in their losing battle. Because Steinberg fights against a sin he committed long ago, even with his Mold Armor he comes closer and closer to transforming into a Demon every time he casts a spell.\n\n==Media==\n\n===Light novels===\nThe ''Strait Jacket'' was written by Ichir\u014d Sakaki with illustrations by Y\u014d Fujishiro.

It was published in 11 volumes between 2000 and 2010. The series was adapted into a 3-episode [[original video animation]] series in 2007. A film version of the OVA aired in the [[United States]] on the [[Syfy]] channel.\n\n==Plot==\n''Strait Jacket'' is set an [[alternate history]] where [[Magic in fiction|magic]] was proven to exist in the year 1899. The use of sorcery spread throughout all facets of society and changed the social and technological development of the world. The location is Tristan, an [[Urban area|urban]] [[metropolis]] that appears to be an amalgamation of turn-of-the-20th-century [[Tokyo]], [[San Francisco]], and [[Victorian era|Victorian-era]] [[London]].\n\nAlongside this technology and science exists magic, which has been proven possible in public demonstrations by Dr. George Greco. Although the use of magic is only possible for a few talented individuals, it is very dangerous and highly illegal. Due to an invisible contaminant called the \"malediction\", or simply the \"[[curse]]\", people who use magic too often are at risk in transforming into \"[[Demon]]s\", or horrific, malevolent abominations of nature that become immune to ordinary weapons. The Magic Administration Bureau, also known as the [[Magic (supernatural)|Sorcery]] Management Bureau, is set up in the attempt to safely explore the nature of magic, officially document it, attempt to provide rational scientific explanation for it, regulate its use and police those who use magic illegally. Magic, utilized in a safe sense by the Bureau, has been used as a viable energy source by the civil service, industry, agriculture, medicine, and the military. Effectively, the Magic Administration Bureau is now in control of every field and every facet of society.\n\nThe primary enemies of the Bureau are Oddman, a former left-wing terrorist cell, turned mercenary. All of these magic users, even the ones with innocent and well-meaning intentions, are in danger of tapping into the dark side either accidentally or on purpose and themselves becoming bloodthirsty beasts due to accidents or sabotage by Oddman's agents. These Sorcerist agents wear a suit of armor that resists the negative transforming effects of magic. These suits are referred to as \"Mold Armor\", or more commonly a \"[[straitjacket]]\", due to the fact they constrain human beings in their natural form. The Sorcerists also use magically-tainted bullets from large hand-carried railguns powered by a combination of steam and magic, which are the only weapons capable of effectively stopping the magically-transformed monsters.\n\nHowever, the over-stretched Bureau is steadily losing ground and increasingly must rely on outside help. There simply aren't enough Sorcerists to fight the Demons caused by Oddman's sabotage. This deliberate sabotage leads to an increase in accidental demonic transformations and attacks on the public across Tristan. Among those who fight the Demons is an unlicensed, rogue Sorcerist named Leiot Steinberg, who is viewed as a loose cannon bringing the name of Sorcerists into disrepute and causing as much damage as the Demons in his one-man war against them. Yet the Bureau is forced to reluctantly call upon his services in their losing battle. Because Steinberg fights against a sin he committed long ago, even with his Mold Armor he comes closer and closer to transforming into a Demon every time he casts a spell.\n\n==Media==\n\n===Light novels===\nThe ''Strait Jacket'' was written by Ichir\u014d Sakaki with illustrations by Y\u014d Fujishiro.

Imperial governments provided pathways for selected nationals to pursue [[higher education]]. The concept of studying abroad was based on the assumption that graduates would return to their homeland to serve colonial administration once they had developed skills and absorbed the values of the colonial rulers.<ref name=\"varghese\">Varghese, N.V. 2008, 'Globalization of higher education and cross-border student mobility', International Institute for Educational Planning, UNESCO</ref>\n\nThe [[Cold War]] era had a significant impact on foreign aid and the funding of overseas students. The policy of distributing scientific knowledge and sharing industrial progress with the developing world required the help of higher education institutions. Support for USAID linked the foreign policy mission with support to higher education. Cold war rivals funded study abroad programmes and were in competition to attract students from the developing world.<ref name=varghese/>\n\nOne of the most famous international exchange programmes that facilitates and encourages international student migration is the [[Fulbright Program]].  Established in 1946, the Fulbright Program provides grants for students, scholars, teachers and professionals to undertake studies and research. The Fulbright Program was initially funded by using proceeds from the sales of surplus war property and was founded on the principal of promoting \"international good will through the exchange of students in the fields of education, culture and science\".<ref>U.S. Department of State: Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs, Fulbright International Educational Exchange Program, {{cite web |url=http://fulbright.state.gov/programs.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-10-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120729120609/http://fulbright.state.gov/programs.html |archivedate=2012-07-29 }}, viewed on 14 October 2010</ref>\n\nThe [[Colombo Plan]] was another program that encouraged the movement of students between countries. The Colombo Plan was established in 1951 with the intention of strengthening economic and social development of the [[Asia Pacific]] region. The Colombo Plan has been responsible for sponsoring over 40,000 Asian students to study or train in Australian higher education institutions. Funding is provided by member countries, which includes a mixture of 26 Commonwealth and non-Commonwealth countries.<ref>Colombo Plan Organisation, {{cite web |url=http://www.colombo-plan.org/history.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-10-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120114051358/http://www.colombo-plan.org/history.php |archivedate=2012-01-14 }}, viewed on 13 October 2010</ref>\n\nSince the colonial and Cold War eras, the profile of international students has made a significant shift. The way in which students travel has changed, and the majority of students seeking education abroad are now self-funded.\n\n== Financing and cost ==\nThe [[international student]] market has become an important source of revenue for local economies and many institutions rely heavily on the income brought by cross-border students.<ref name=varghese/> Receiving countries could benefit from qualified skilled migrants who make considerable contributions to their new countries. International students are also demanding more \"value for money\" as finding job opportunities abroad is becoming more difficult.[http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20180724145334625]  \n\t\nIn most host countries, higher education was tuition fee-free. Until the 1980s, many countries had not any provision for levying fees on domestic and international students. The UK was the first to introduce fees on overseas students; other countries, such as Australia, began to follow suit.<ref name=varghese/>\n\nThe international market for students now accounts for billions of dollars and, subsequently, competition between institutions is fierce. Studying abroad is expensive and in most cases is funded by the individual.\n\nIn OECD countries there are three patterns to the levying of fees:\n\n# In some countries fees for international students are higher than domestic students. This occurs in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the UK and the USA. Sweden started levying fees for non-European students from 2011.\n# Some countries make no distinction between international and domestic student fees. Tuition fees remain the same for foreign and domestic students in France, Greece, Hungary, Italy and Japan.\n# Countries such as Denmark, Finland and Norway have not begun levying tuition fees from foreign students.<ref name=varghese/>\n\n== Destination countries ==\nBetween 1963 and 2006 the number of students studying in a foreign country increased 9 times.  In 2006 there were 2.7 million students studying abroad and there are predictions that the demand for cross-border education will increase to 7.2 million by 2025.<ref name=varghese/>\n\n[[OECD]] countries receive approximately 85% of the world\u2019s foreign students with the majority concentrated in just 6 countries.  In 2007, the [[United States]] accounted for 21.4% of foreign enrolments, the [[United Kingdom]] 12.6%, [[France]] 8.8%, [[Australia]] 7.6%, [[Germany]] 7.4%, and [[Japan]] 4.5%.<ref name=\"UNESCO\">UNESCO Institute of Statistics, 2009, Global Education Digest: Comparing Education Statistics around the world, pp. 45-49</ref>\n\nAustralia has the highest ratio of international students per head of population in the world by a large margin, with 812,000 international students enrolled in the nation's universities and vocational institutions in 2019.<ref>https://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/property/booming-student-market-a-valuable-property/news-story/6bb3823260aa3443f0c26909406d089b</ref><ref>https://www.macrobusiness.com.au/2019/11/australian-universities-double-down-on-international-students/</ref>. Accordingly, in 2019, international students represented on average 26.7% of the student bodies of Australian universities.   International education therefore represents one of the country's largest exports and has a pronounced influcence on the country's demographics, with a significant proportion of international students remaining in Australia after graduation on various skill and employment visas.<ref>https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-07-27/temporary-graduate-visa-485-boom/10035390</ref>\n\n[[Europe]] is also a major destination, with approximately 840,000 international students.  However the majority of this figure comes from students moving from one European country to another.<ref name=UNESCO/>\n\n[[East Asia]] and the [[Pacific]] top the list for sending students and accounts for 29% of all international higher education students.  (Students from [[China]] account for 15% of this total.) [[North America]] and [[Western Europe]] account for 18%, then Central and East Europe 11%, South and West Asia 9%, [[Arab States]] 7% and [[Sub Saharan Africa]] 5.8%.<ref name=UNESCO/>\n\n== Contributing factors to growth in student migration ==\nThere are many factors contributing to the growing numbers of student migration. \nMany [[developing countries]] have an under supply of university places to satisfy demand and as a result students have no other choice but to [[study abroad]].  In addition to this it is a common expectation that studying overseas can enhance professional business opportunities.<ref name=gribble/>  Generally, students seeking cross-border education migrate to countries with more developed education institutions than their own.  For example, students in Arab countries migrate to Egypt and Jordan to pursue their studies, and many students from Bangladesh and Nepal travel to India.\nThe flow of students from [[developing countries]] to [[developed countries]] is often due to the belief that the quality and standards of education offered in [[OECD]] countries is superior to what is offered in the country of origin.<ref name=varghese/>\n\nHigher education has become a major global export commodity with [[developing countries]] capitalising on domestic shortages by recruiting [[foreign student]]s.  Subsequently, changes to visa and immigration policies have provided incentives for students to travel abroad and potentially offer a gateway to permanent residency within a host nation.  Migration opportunities are one of the major contributions to the growth of student migration.  A 2006 survey, undertaken by Australia\u2019s Monash University, produced statistics which showed 75% of Indian students who completed university education in Australia applied for and were granted residency.  The author of the research, Michiel Bass suggests that the most influential reason Indian students studied in Australia was not because of academic reputation, but the opportunity to gain permanent residency.<ref name=\"verbik\">Verbik, L., Lasanowski, V. 2007, International Student Mobility: Patterns & Trends, The Observatory on Borderless Higher Education, Association of Commonwealth Universities & Universities UK</ref>\n\nAn important factor contributing to student migration is the desire to study in a language other than the student's first language. For example, a growth in the number of students travelling to study in the UK from Central and Eastern Europe has been partially attributed to the wish \"to study in a higher education environment where communication is in English\".<ref name=\"catterall\">https://www.researchgate.net/publication/269872663_Developing_Writing_Skills_for_International_Students_Adopting_a_critical_pragmatic_approach</ref>\n\nOther factors for the rise in student migration include lowering travel expenses and greater [[communication technology]] which has made studying abroad more accessible.<ref name=gribble/>\n\n== Student visa and immigration policies ==\n\n=== United States ===\nThe US attracts a large number of foreigners to its workforce each year, however international graduates of US institutions do not automatically have the right to remain in the country for work purposes upon completion of their course.  In fact, as part of the student application process, applicants must state that they are not planning to [[emigrate]] to the US.<ref name=verbik/>\n\nVisa and immigration policies in the US are (arguably) significantly less accommodating towards international students and graduates compared to other host countries.  The greatest changes to visa regulations occurred after the attacks of September 11, 2001, when the US immediately implemented tougher visa and immigration requirements.  Under the Enhanced Border Security and Visas Entry Reform Act (2002) the US introduced a new overseas student tax in order to fund an advanced computer tracking system for visa applications, but also made it more difficult for applicants to transfer between visa categories.<ref name=verbik/>\n\nHowever, recently the [[US Department of State]] has established a new [[internship]] scheme which has been specifically designed for foreign students.  Since July 2007, certain international students are eligible to participate in a year-long [[internship]] per degree level for practical training as long as they can describe how the experience can enhance their education.<ref name=verbik/>\n\n=== United Kingdom ===\nIn 2006, as part of a larger scheme to attract highly [[skilled labour]], the UK government made amendments to the Science and Engineering Graduate Scheme (SEGS) which enabled all international students who have completed a post-graduate degree course (Master\u2019s of PhD starting after 1 May 2006) to remain in the UK and seek employment for up to 12 months regardless of discipline.<ref name=verbik/>\nThe Government has also made a special provision for internationally coveted [[Master of Business Administration]] (MBA) students, allowing graduates of 50 highly ranked business schools to apply for a three-year extension to their one-year working visa once their studies have been completed.<ref name=verbik/>\nAs part of the [[Highly Skilled Migrant Programme]] (HSMP), such students have been eligible to apply for [[permanent residency|permanent residence]] since 12 April 2005.  The Government further extended opportunities for non EU/EEA students in 2007, which allows all students who have completed degree programmes in the UK the opportunity to stay in the UK for employment purposes.  The [[International Graduates Scheme]] has been in operation since 1 May 2007.<ref name=verbik/>\n\nHowever, in March 2011, the UK Government made an announcement on reforming student visa system, which is getting much stricter The major changes in student immigration policies including tougher requirements for entrance, tightening work entitlements and closing the post-study work route are aimed at ensuring the UK welcomes the best overseas students with expected contribution.\n\n=== Germany and France ===\nSince January 2005, Germany has issued singular permits for both residence and employment in an effort to attract international students and skilled migrants to the country and facilitate their arrival.  Overseas students are also eligible to apply for an extension on their residence permit for up to one year for the purpose of seeking employment which is relevant to their field of study upon completion of their studies.\n \nIn France, international students have the right to work part-time for up to 19 hours per week whilst studying.  Students must, however, have a valid residency permit and be enrolled in an institution which participates in the French social protection system.  Upon completion of studies, students are able to accept offers of employment from French firms by applying for temporary employment authorization. It ought to be noted that both Germany and France belongs to the [[Schengen Area|Schengen agreement]].<ref name=verbik/>\n\n=== Australia ===\nIn addition to Australia's points system, which encourages skilled migration, regulations allow all international students completing an Australian degree to remain in the country for 18 months upon graduating. Students can earn bonus points for skilled work experience and English-language proficiency in addition to those already earned for Australian qualifications, under amendments to the General Skilled Migration Programme (GSM). Previously, international students were exempt from [[work experience]] requirements when applying for general skilled migration.<ref name=verbik/>\n\nLegislation introduced on September 1, 2007 requires authorities to provide 'temporary visas' to enable applicants to earn experience. These changes were made to strengthen links between study, work experience and employment to ensure migrants have the skills that Australian employers are looking for. The main rationale behind these schemes is the desire for Australia to benefit from the skills of foreign graduates.<ref name=verbik/>\n\nStudents no longer have the option to remain in Australia following the completion of a master's degree for the purposes of work. It is now necessary to re-apply under specific sponsorship.<ref name=verbik/>\n\n=== Canada ===\nInternational students travelling to Canada are not required to apply for a study visa unless the programmes they are enrolled in are longer than 6 months.  Acquiring a study permit, does however have significant benefits to students, giving them permission to seek part-time employment on campus and since April 2006, off campus, for up to 20 hours per week whilst they are completing their studies.\nUnder the Post-Graduation Work Permit Programmes, international graduates from Canadian higher education institutions are eligible to apply for employment of up to two years.<ref name=verbik/>\n\nIn 2008, 105 780 study permits applied for from outside Canada were processed, and in 22% of those cases a study permit was refused.  Refusal rates varied by region, with 11% of applicants from Europe refused and 35% from Africa and the Middle East refused.<ref>[http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/resources/evaluation/isp/findings.asp Evaluation of the International Student Program: Findings] ''[[Department of Citizenship and Immigration Canada]]'' Accessed 27 February 2014</ref>\n\n=== New Zealand ===\nIn New Zealand, international students are not required to apply for a student visa if they are studying for a course which is less than three months in duration.  Under certain circumstances international students can seek part-time employment for up to 20 hours per week whilst studying (full-time) in a course that at least 6 months in duration.  \nIn July 2007, amendments were made to the [[Skilled Migrant Category (New Zealand)|Skilled Migrant Category]] which gives students the opportunity to earn bonus points for recognized New Zealand higher education qualifications or for two years of full-time study in the country.  In addition, the number of years to require points for work experience in New Zealand will be reduced and international students may be eligible to apply for a work visa for up to two year upon completion of their studies in the country.\n\n== Issues that can arise with student migration ==\nThe loss of students from sending countries can have a rather detrimental impact on the economy by depleting already scarce resources.<ref name=gribble/> [[Brain drain]] is the large scale loss of individuals with technical skills or knowledge.\n\nDifferences in learning cultures is an issue in student migration. This means that the students can have difficulty if the teaching, learning and assessment methods are very different from those in their previous education.<ref name=catterall/>  For example, some European students studying in Britain have been noted as having little experience of a number of tasks typically expected of British students while many are familiar \"with only traditional forms of assessment such as examinations\".<ref name=catterall/>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Brain drain]]\n* [[Colombo Plan]]\n* [[Fulbright Program]]\n* [[Immigration]]\n* [[Immigration policy]]\n* [[International student]]\n* [[Student exchange]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n\n==External links==\n* Bulgarian Student Migration to Hungary https://www.academia.edu/2549846/_._._Bulgarian_Student_Migration_to_Hungary_in_the_Second_Half_of_the_19th_and_the_First_Half_of_the_20th_Centuries_19-20_\n* [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2018.07.001 Research on social inclusion of international students]\n\n[[Category:Student migration| ]]\n[[Category:United States visas by type]]\n[[Category:Visa policy of the United States]]\n[[Category:Human migration]]\n", "text_old": "'''Student migration''' is the movement of students who study outside their country of birth or citizenship for a period of 12 months or more.<ref>Spring, J. 2009, Globalization of Education: An Introduction, QueensCollege & Graduate Centre, City University of New York</ref> During the period of [[globalization]], the internationalisation of higher education increased dramatically and it has become a market driven activity.

Imperial governments provided pathways for selected nationals to pursue [[higher education]]. The concept of studying abroad was based on the assumption that graduates would return to their homeland to serve colonial administration once they had developed skills and absorbed the values of the colonial rulers.<ref name=\"varghese\">Varghese, N.V. 2008, 'Globalization of higher education and cross-border student mobility', International Institute for Educational Planning, UNESCO</ref>\n\nThe [[Cold War]] era had a significant impact on foreign aid and the funding of overseas students. The policy of distributing scientific knowledge and sharing industrial progress with the developing world required the help of higher education institutions. Support for USAID linked the foreign policy mission with support to higher education. Cold war rivals funded study abroad programmes and were in competition to attract students from the developing world.<ref name=varghese/>\n\nOne of the most famous international exchange programmes that facilitates and encourages international student migration is the [[Fulbright Program]].  Established in 1946, the Fulbright Program provides grants for students, scholars, teachers and professionals to undertake studies and research. The Fulbright Program was initially funded by using proceeds from the sales of surplus war property and was founded on the principal of promoting \"international good will through the exchange of students in the fields of education, culture and science\".<ref>U.S. Department of State: Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs, Fulbright International Educational Exchange Program, {{cite web |url=http://fulbright.state.gov/programs.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-10-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120729120609/http://fulbright.state.gov/programs.html |archivedate=2012-07-29 }}, viewed on 14 October 2010</ref>\n\nThe [[Colombo Plan]] was another program that encouraged the movement of students between countries. The Colombo Plan was established in 1951 with the intention of strengthening economic and social development of the [[Asia Pacific]] region. The Colombo Plan has been responsible for sponsoring over 40,000 Asian students to study or train in Australian higher education institutions. Funding is provided by member countries, which includes a mixture of 26 Commonwealth and non-Commonwealth countries.<ref>Colombo Plan Organisation, {{cite web |url=http://www.colombo-plan.org/history.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-10-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120114051358/http://www.colombo-plan.org/history.php |archivedate=2012-01-14 }}, viewed on 13 October 2010</ref>\n\nSince the colonial and Cold War eras, the profile of international students has made a significant shift. The way in which students travel has changed, and the majority of students seeking education abroad are now self-funded.\n\n== Financing and cost ==\nThe [[international student]] market has become an important source of revenue for local economies and many institutions rely heavily on the income brought by cross-border students.<ref name=varghese/> Receiving countries could benefit from qualified skilled migrants who make considerable contributions to their new countries. International students are also demanding more \"value for money\" as finding job opportunities abroad is becoming more difficult.[http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20180724145334625]  \n\t\nIn most host countries, higher education was tuition fee-free. Until the 1980s, many countries had not any provision for levying fees on domestic and international students. The UK was the first to introduce fees on overseas students; other countries, such as Australia, began to follow suit.<ref name=varghese/>\n\nThe international market for students now accounts for billions of dollars and, subsequently, competition between institutions is fierce. Studying abroad is expensive and in most cases is funded by the individual.\n\nIn OECD countries there are three patterns to the levying of fees:\n\n# In some countries fees for international students are higher than domestic students. This occurs in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the UK and the USA. Sweden started levying fees for non-European students from 2011.\n# Some countries make no distinction between international and domestic student fees. Tuition fees remain the same for foreign and domestic students in France, Greece, Hungary, Italy and Japan.\n# Countries such as Denmark, Finland and Norway have not begun levying tuition fees from foreign students.<ref name=varghese/>\n\n== Destination countries ==\nBetween 1963 and 2006 the number of students studying in a foreign country increased 9 times.  In 2006 there were 2.7 million students studying abroad and there are predictions that the demand for cross-border education will increase to 7.2 million by 2025.<ref name=varghese/>\n\n[[OECD]] countries receive approximately 85% of the world\u2019s foreign students with the majority concentrated in just 6 countries.  In 2007, the [[United States]] accounted for 21.4% of foreign enrolments, the [[United Kingdom]] 12.6%, [[France]] 8.8%, [[Australia]] 7.6%, [[Germany]] 7.4%, and [[Japan]] 4.5%.<ref name=\"UNESCO\">UNESCO Institute of Statistics, 2009, Global Education Digest: Comparing Education Statistics around the world, pp. 45-49</ref>\n\nAustralia has the highest ratio of international students per head of population in the world by a large margin, with 812,000 international students enrolled in the nation's universities and vocational institutions in 2019.<ref>https://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/property/booming-student-market-a-valuable-property/news-story/6bb3823260aa3443f0c26909406d089b</ref><ref>https://www.macrobusiness.com.au/2019/11/australian-universities-double-down-on-international-students/</ref>. Accordingly, in 2019, international students represented on average 26.7% of the student bodies of Australian universities.   International education therefore represents one of the country's largest exports and has a pronounced influcence on the country's demographics, with a significant proportion of international students remaining in Australia after graduation on various skill and employment visas.<ref>https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-07-27/temporary-graduate-visa-485-boom/10035390</ref>\n\n[[Europe]] is also a major destination, with approximately 840,000 international students.  However the majority of this figure comes from students moving from one European country to another.<ref name=UNESCO/>\n\n[[East Asia]] and the [[Pacific]] top the list for sending students and accounts for 29% of all international higher education students.  (Students from [[China]] account for 15% of this total.) [[North America]] and [[Western Europe]] account for 18%, then Central and East Europe 11%, South and West Asia 9%, [[Arab States]] 7% and [[Sub Saharan Africa]] 5.8%.<ref name=UNESCO/>\n\n== Contributing factors to growth in student migration ==\nThere are many factors contributing to the growing numbers of student migration. \nMany [[developing countries]] have an under supply of university places to satisfy demand and as a result students have no other choice but to [[study abroad]].  In addition to this it is a common expectation that studying overseas can enhance professional business opportunities.<ref name=gribble/>  Generally, students seeking cross-border education migrate to countries with more developed education institutions than their own.  For example, students in Arab countries migrate to Egypt and Jordan to pursue their studies, and many students from Bangladesh and Nepal travel to India.\nThe flow of students from [[developing countries]] to [[developed countries]] is often due to the belief that the quality and standards of education offered in [[OECD]] countries is superior to what is offered in the country of origin.<ref name=varghese/>\n\nHigher education has become a major global export commodity with [[developing countries]] capitalising on domestic shortages by recruiting [[foreign student]]s.  Subsequently, changes to visa and immigration policies have provided incentives for students to travel abroad and potentially offer a gateway to permanent residency within a host nation.  Migration opportunities are one of the major contributions to the growth of student migration.  A 2006 survey, undertaken by Australia\u2019s Monash University, produced statistics which showed 75% of Indian students who completed university education in Australia applied for and were granted residency.  The author of the research, Michiel Bass suggests that the most influential reason Indian students studied in Australia was not because of academic reputation, but the opportunity to gain permanent residency.<ref name=\"verbik\">Verbik, L., Lasanowski, V. 2007, International Student Mobility: Patterns & Trends, The Observatory on Borderless Higher Education, Association of Commonwealth Universities & Universities UK</ref>\n\nAn important factor contributing to student migration is the desire to study in a language other than the student's first language. For example, a growth in the number of students travelling to study in the UK from Central and Eastern Europe has been partially attributed to the wish \"to study in a higher education environment where communication is in English\".<ref name=\"catterall\">https://www.researchgate.net/publication/269872663_Developing_Writing_Skills_for_International_Students_Adopting_a_critical_pragmatic_approach</ref>\n\nOther factors for the rise in student migration include lowering travel expenses and greater [[communication technology]] which has made studying abroad more accessible.<ref name=gribble/>\n\n== Student visa and immigration policies ==\n\n=== United States ===\nThe US attracts a large number of foreigners to its workforce each year, however international graduates of US institutions do not automatically have the right to remain in the country for work purposes upon completion of their course.  In fact, as part of the student application process, applicants must state that they are not planning to [[emigrate]] to the US.<ref name=verbik/>\n\nVisa and immigration policies in the US are (arguably) significantly less accommodating towards international students and graduates compared to other host countries.  The greatest changes to visa regulations occurred after the attacks of September 11, 2001, when the US immediately implemented tougher visa and immigration requirements.  Under the Enhanced Border Security and Visas Entry Reform Act (2002) the US introduced a new overseas student tax in order to fund an advanced computer tracking system for visa applications, but also made it more difficult for applicants to transfer between visa categories.<ref name=verbik/>\n\nHowever, recently the [[US Department of State]] has established a new [[internship]] scheme which has been specifically designed for foreign students.  Since July 2007, certain international students are eligible to participate in a year-long [[internship]] per degree level for practical training as long as they can describe how the experience can enhance their education.<ref name=verbik/>\n\n=== United Kingdom ===\nIn 2006, as part of a larger scheme to attract highly [[skilled labour]], the UK government made amendments to the Science and Engineering Graduate Scheme (SEGS) which enabled all international students who have completed a post-graduate degree course (Master\u2019s of PhD starting after 1 May 2006) to remain in the UK and seek employment for up to 12 months regardless of discipline.<ref name=verbik/>\nThe Government has also made a special provision for internationally coveted [[Masters of Business Administration]] (MBA) students, allowing graduates of 50 highly ranked business schools to apply for a three-year extension to their one-year working visa once their studies have been completed.<ref name=verbik/>\nAs part of the [[Highly Skilled Migrant Programme]] (HSMP), such students have been eligible to apply for [[permanent residency|permanent residence]] since 12 April 2005.  The Government further extended opportunities for non EU/EEA students in 2007, which allows all students who have completed degree programmes in the UK the opportunity to stay in the UK for employment purposes.  The [[International Graduates Scheme]] has been in operation since 1 May 2007.<ref name=verbik/>\n\nHowever, in March 2011, the UK Government made an announcement on reforming student visa system, which is getting much stricter The major changes in student immigration policies including tougher requirements for entrance, tightening work entitlements and closing the post-study work route are aimed at ensuring the UK welcomes the best overseas students with expected contribution.\n\n=== Germany and France ===\nSince January 2005, Germany has issued singular permits for both residence and employment in an effort to attract international students and skilled migrants to the country and facilitate their arrival.  Overseas students are also eligible to apply for an extension on their residence permit for up to one year for the purpose of seeking employment which is relevant to their field of study upon completion of their studies.\n \nIn France, international students have the right to work part-time for up to 19 hours per week whilst studying.  Students must, however, have a valid residency permit and be enrolled in an institution which participates in the French social protection system.  Upon completion of studies, students are able to accept offers of employment from French firms by applying for temporary employment authorization. It ought to be noted that both Germany and France belongs to the [[Schengen Area|Schengen agreement]].<ref name=verbik/>\n\n=== Australia ===\nIn addition to Australia's points system, which encourages skilled migration, regulations allow all international students completing an Australian degree to remain in the country for 18 months upon graduating. Students can earn bonus points for skilled work experience and English-language proficiency in addition to those already earned for Australian qualifications, under amendments to the General Skilled Migration Programme (GSM). Previously, international students were exempt from [[work experience]] requirements when applying for general skilled migration.<ref name=verbik/>\n\nLegislation introduced on September 1, 2007 requires authorities to provide 'temporary visas' to enable applicants to earn experience. These changes were made to strengthen links between study, work experience and employment to ensure migrants have the skills that Australian employers are looking for. The main rationale behind these schemes is the desire for Australia to benefit from the skills of foreign graduates.<ref name=verbik/>\n\nStudents no longer have the option to remain in Australia following the completion of a master's degree for the purposes of work. It is now necessary to re-apply under specific sponsorship.<ref name=verbik/>\n\n=== Canada ===\nInternational students travelling to Canada are not required to apply for a study visa unless the programmes they are enrolled in are longer than 6 months.  Acquiring a study permit, does however have significant benefits to students, giving them permission to seek part-time employment on campus and since April 2006, off campus, for up to 20 hours per week whilst they are completing their studies.\nUnder the Post-Graduation Work Permit Programmes, international graduates from Canadian higher education institutions are eligible to apply for employment of up to two years.<ref name=verbik/>\n\nIn 2008, 105 780 study permits applied for from outside Canada were processed, and in 22% of those cases a study permit was refused.  Refusal rates varied by region, with 11% of applicants from Europe refused and 35% from Africa and the Middle East refused.<ref>[http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/resources/evaluation/isp/findings.asp Evaluation of the International Student Program: Findings] ''[[Department of Citizenship and Immigration Canada]]'' Accessed 27 February 2014</ref>\n\n=== New Zealand ===\nIn New Zealand, international students are not required to apply for a student visa if they are studying for a course which is less than three months in duration.  Under certain circumstances international students can seek part-time employment for up to 20 hours per week whilst studying (full-time) in a course that at least 6 months in duration.  \nIn July 2007, amendments were made to the [[Skilled Migrant Category (New Zealand)|Skilled Migrant Category]] which gives students the opportunity to earn bonus points for recognized New Zealand higher education qualifications or for two years of full-time study in the country.  In addition, the number of years to require points for work experience in New Zealand will be reduced and international students may be eligible to apply for a work visa for up to two year upon completion of their studies in the country.\n\n== Issues that can arise with student migration ==\nThe loss of students from sending countries can have a rather detrimental impact on the economy by depleting already scarce resources.<ref name=gribble/> [[Brain drain]] is the large scale loss of individuals with technical skills or knowledge.\n\nDifferences in learning cultures is an issue in student migration.

This figure is relevant in [[Composite material|composites]], in [[mining]] (particular with regard to the properties of [[tailings]]), and in [[soil science]].

The 120th TCU football team played as a member of the [[Big 12 Conference]] (Big 12), led by 15th-year head coach [[Gary Patterson]]. The Horned Frogs played their home games at [[Amon G. Carter Stadium]] in [[Fort Worth, Texas]].\n\nTCU (11\u20132, 7\u20132) finished the season ranked #7 in the nation after a victory in the [[2016 Alamo Bowl (January)|Alamo Bowl]]. The season marked the Horned Frogs' fifth top-10 finish and sixth top-15 finish in the last 8 seasons. The Horned Frogs notched their sixth 11+ win season in the last 8 years and their tenth 10+ win season in the 15-year Gary Patterson era.\n\n==Previous season==\nThe [[2014 TCU Horned Frogs football team]] notched a 12\u20131 record and finished the season ranked #3. The Horned Frogs introduced a new, up-tempo offense in 2014 under new co-offensive coordinators [[Doug Meacham]] and [[Sonny Cumbie]], led by junior quarterback [[Trevone Boykin]], who finished 4th in the 2014 [[Heisman Trophy]] voting. The Frogs' sole loss came at [[2014 Baylor Bears football team|#5 Baylor]], 58\u201361. TCU knocked off three top-10 teams during their 2014 campaign, [[2014 Oklahoma Sooners football team|#4 Oklahoma]], [[2014 Kansas State Wildcats football team|#7 Kansas State]] and [[2014 Ole Miss Rebels football team|#9 Ole Miss]]. During the regular season, the Horned Frogs ranked as high as #3 in the [[2014 NCAA Division I FBS football rankings#CFP Rankings|College Football Playoff Rankings]] and were in the mix to be included in the inaugural, 4-team [[College Football Playoff]]. In the next-to-last CFP rankings, the Frogs checked in at #3; however, even after a decisive 55\u20133 win over Iowa State in the final week, the College Football Playoff Selection Committee dropped the Big 12 Co-Champion Horned Frogs from #3 to #6, and out of the Playoff, in the final regular-season rankings. The Horned Frogs were invited to play in the [[2014 Peach Bowl]], in [[Atlanta|Atlanta, Georgia]], against the [[2014 Ole Miss Rebels football team|Ole Miss Rebels]] of the [[Southeastern Conference|SEC]]. The Horned Frogs shut down the Rebel offense and picked apart the vaunted Ole Miss defense in a decisive 42\u20133 TCU victory.\n\n==Preseason==\n===Recruiting===\nNational Signing Day unofficially kicked off the new season on February 5, 2015.

TCU played without its starting quarterback and preseason Heisman Trophy favorite [[Trevone Boykin]] after he suffered an ankle injury early in the Frogs' game against Kansas on November 14.  Leading wide receiver [[Josh Doctson]], who received Heisman Trophy consideration midseason, was also out due to a wrist injury suffered at Oklahoma State on November 7.  Including these two injuries, which topped pre-game headlines, the injury-plagued Horned Frogs squad was without its starting quarterback, 4 of their 6 top wide receivers, 2 of their 6 top offensive linemen, one starting defensive end, two starting linebackers, their starting free safety, one starting cornerback, and their starting long snapper.  Additional early-season losses had also depleted the Frogs' depth.  The Horned Frogs stormed back in the fourth quarter but failed to convert a would-be-winning-2-point try with less than a minute remaining.\n\n===Baylor===\n{{See also|2015 Baylor Bears football team}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!

The 120th TCU football team played as a member of the [[Big 12 Conference]] (Big 12), led by 15th-year head coach [[Gary Patterson]]. The Horned Frogs played their home games at [[Amon G. Carter Stadium]] in [[Fort Worth, Texas]].\n\nTCU (11\u20132, 7\u20132) finished the season ranked #7 in the nation after a victory in the [[2016 Alamo Bowl (January)|Alamo Bowl]]. The season marked the Horned Frogs' fifth top-10 finish and sixth top-15 finish in the last 8 seasons. The Horned Frogs notched their sixth 11+ win season in the last 8 years and their tenth 10+ win season in the 15-year Gary Patterson era.\n\n==Previous season==\nThe [[2014 TCU Horned Frogs football team]] notched a 12\u20131 record and finished the season ranked #3. The Horned Frogs introduced a new, up-tempo offense in 2014 under new co-offensive coordinators [[Doug Meacham]] and [[Sonny Cumbie]], led by junior quarterback [[Trevone Boykin]], who finished 4th in the 2014 [[Heisman Trophy]] voting. The Frogs' sole loss came at [[2014 Baylor Bears football team|#5 Baylor]], 58\u201361. TCU knocked off three top-10 teams during their 2014 campaign, [[2014 Oklahoma Sooners football team|#4 Oklahoma]], [[2014 Kansas State Wildcats football team|#7 Kansas State]] and [[2014 Ole Miss Rebels football team|#9 Ole Miss]]. During the regular season, the Horned Frogs ranked as high as #3 in the [[2014 NCAA Division I FBS football rankings#CFP Rankings|College Football Playoff Rankings]] and were in the mix to be included in the inaugural, 4-team [[College Football Playoff]]. In the next-to-last CFP rankings, the Frogs checked in at #3; however, even after a decisive 55\u20133 win over Iowa State in the final week, the College Football Playoff Selection Committee dropped the Big 12 Co-Champion Horned Frogs from #3 to #6, and out of the Playoff, in the final regular-season rankings. The Horned Frogs were invited to play in the [[2014 Peach Bowl]], in [[Atlanta|Atlanta, Georgia]], against the [[2014 Ole Miss Rebels football team|Ole Miss Rebels]] of the [[Southeastern Conference|SEC]].

TCU played without its starting quarterback and preseason Heisman Trophy favorite [[Trevone Boykin]] after he suffered an ankle injury early in the Frogs' game against Kansas on November 14.  Leading wide receiver [[Josh Doctson]], who received Heisman Trophy consideration midseason, was also out due to a wrist injury suffered at Oklahoma State on November 7.  Including these two injuries, which topped pre-game headlines, the injury-plagued Horned Frogs squad was without its starting quarterback, 4 of their 6 top wide receivers, 2 of their 6 top offensive linemen, one starting defensive end, two starting linebackers, their starting free safety, one starting cornerback, and their starting long snapper.  Additional early-season losses had also depleted the Frogs' depth.  The Horned Frogs stormed back in the fourth quarter but failed to convert a would-be-winning-2-point try with less than a minute remaining.\n\n===Baylor===\n{{See also|2015 Baylor Bears football team}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!
