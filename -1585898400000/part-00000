{"title_page": "Wind chill", "text_new": "{{About|the meteorological effect of \"wind chill\"|other uses|Wind chill (disambiguation)}}\n\n[[Image:Wind chill.png|thumb|A chart of wind chill values for given air temperatures and wind speeds]]\n'''Wind-chill''' or '''windchill''' (popularly '''wind chill factor''') is the lowering of [[body temperature]] due to the passing-flow of lower-temperature air.\n\nWind chill numbers are always lower than the air temperature for values where the formula is valid. When the [[apparent temperature]] is higher than the air temperature, the [[heat index]] is used instead.\n\n== Explanation ==\nA surface loses heat through [[Thermal conduction|conduction]], [[evaporation]], [[convection]], and [[radiation]].<ref>{{cite book|author1=Vincent J. Schaefer|author2=John A. Day|author3=Jay Pasachoff|title=A Field Guide to the Atmosphere|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q0QI19T_POkC|year=1998|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|isbn=0-395-97631-6}}</ref>  The rate of convection depends on both the difference in temperature between the surface and the fluid surrounding it and the velocity of that fluid with respect to the surface.  As convection from a warm surface heats the air around it, an insulating [[boundary layer]] of warm air forms against the surface. Moving air disrupts this boundary layer, or epiclimate, allowing for cooler air to replace the warm air against the surface. The faster the wind speed, the more readily the surface cools.\n\n== Alternative approaches ==\nMany formulas exist for wind chill because, unlike temperature, wind chill has no universally agreed upon standard definition or measurement.  All the formulas attempt to qualitatively predict the effect of wind on the temperature humans ''perceive''.  Weather services in different countries use standards unique to their country or region; for example, the U.S. and Canadian weather services use a model accepted by the [[National Weather Service]].  That model has evolved over time.\n\nThe first wind chill formulas and tables were developed by [[Paul Allman Siple]] and [[Charles F. Passel]] working in the Antarctic before the [[Second World War]], and were made available by the [[National Weather Service]] by the 1970s. They were based on the cooling rate of a small plastic bottle as its contents turned to ice while suspended in the wind on the expedition hut roof, at the same level as the [[anemometer]].  The so-called Windchill Index provided a pretty good indication of the severity of the weather.\n\nIn the 1960s, wind chill began to be reported as a '''wind chill equivalent temperature''' (WCET), which is theoretically less useful.  The author of this change is unknown, but it was not Siple or Passel as is generally believed.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}  At first, it was defined as the temperature at which the windchill index would be the same in the complete absence of wind.  This led to equivalent temperatures that exaggerated the severity of the weather.  Charles Eagan<ref>Eagan, C. (1964). Review of research on military problems in cold regions.  C. Kolb and F. Holstrom eds. TDR-64-28.  Arctic Aeromed. Lab. p 147\u2013156.</ref> realized that people are rarely still and that even when it was calm, there was some air movement.  He redefined the absence of wind to be an air speed of {{convert|1.8|m/s|km/h mph}}, which was about as low a wind speed as a cup anemometer could measure.  This led to more realistic (warmer-sounding) values of equivalent temperature.\n\n=== Original model ===\nEquivalent temperature was not universally used in North America until the 21st century.  Until the 1970s, the coldest parts of Canada reported the original Wind Chill Index, a three or four digit number with units of kilocalories/hour per square metre.  Each individual calibrated the scale of numbers personally, through experience. The chart also provided general guidance to comfort and hazard through threshold values of the index, such as 1400, which was the threshold for [[frostbite]].\n\nThe original formula for the index was:<ref>*Woodson, Wesley E.

When the [[apparent temperature]] is higher than the air temperature, the [[heat index]] is used instead.\n\n== Explanation ==\nA surface loses heat through [[Thermal conduction|conduction]], [[evaporation]], [[convection]], and [[radiation]].<ref>{{cite book|author1=Vincent J.

As convection from a warm surface heats the air around it, an insulating [[boundary layer]] of warm air forms against the surface. Moving air disrupts this boundary layer, or epiclimate, allowing for cooler air to replace the warm air against the surface. The faster the wind speed, the more readily the surface cools.\n\n== Alternative approaches ==\nMany formulas exist for wind chill because, unlike temperature, wind chill has no universally agreed upon standard definition or measurement.  All the formulas attempt to qualitatively predict the effect of wind on the temperature humans ''perceive''.  Weather services in different countries use standards unique to their country or region; for example, the U.S. and Canadian weather services use a model accepted by the [[National Weather Service]].  That model has evolved over time.\n\nThe first wind chill formulas and tables were developed by [[Paul Allman Siple]] and [[Charles F. Passel]] working in the Antarctic before the [[Second World War]], and were made available by the [[National Weather Service]] by the 1970s. They were based on the cooling rate of a small plastic bottle as its contents turned to ice while suspended in the wind on the expedition hut roof, at the same level as the [[anemometer]].  The so-called Windchill Index provided a pretty good indication of the severity of the weather.\n\nIn the 1960s, wind chill began to be reported as a '''wind chill equivalent temperature''' (WCET), which is theoretically less useful.  The author of this change is unknown, but it was not Siple or Passel as is generally believed.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}  At first, it was defined as the temperature at which the windchill index would be the same in the complete absence of wind.  This led to equivalent temperatures that exaggerated the severity of the weather.  Charles Eagan<ref>Eagan, C. (1964). Review of research on military problems in cold regions.  C. Kolb and F. Holstrom eds. TDR-64-28.  Arctic Aeromed. Lab. p 147\u2013156.</ref> realized that people are rarely still and that even when it was calm, there was some air movement.  He redefined the absence of wind to be an air speed of {{convert|1.8|m/s|km/h mph}}, which was about as low a wind speed as a cup anemometer could measure.  This led to more realistic (warmer-sounding) values of equivalent temperature.\n\n=== Original model ===\nEquivalent temperature was not universally used in North America until the 21st century.  Until the 1970s, the coldest parts of Canada reported the original Wind Chill Index, a three or four digit number with units of kilocalories/hour per square metre.  Each individual calibrated the scale of numbers personally, through experience. The chart also provided general guidance to comfort and hazard through threshold values of the index, such as 1400, which was the threshold for [[frostbite]].\n\nThe original formula for the index was:<ref>*Woodson, Wesley E.

The thickness of the walls in the nest decreases away from the queen and towards the exterior although if the nest is attacked by predators then the walls will be reinforced.

Eusocial insects are animals that develop large, multigenerational cooperative societies that assist each other in the rearing of young, often at the cost of an individual\u2019s life or reproductive ability. Such altruism is explained in that eusocial insects benefit from giving up reproductive ability of many individuals to improve the overall fitness of closely related offspring. [[Kin selection|Hamilton\u2019s rule]] is the key to explaining this phenomenon, where altruism is justified evolutionarily when the benefit to the individual receiving the help, weighted by the relatedness to said individual, outweighs the cost to the organism being altruistic.\nIn most cases, termites included, individuals specialize to fill different needs that the overall colony may have.

These studies and others have shown that the termite interacts with many different organisms including a [[bat]] that roosts in its nest and various species of [[ant]]s that cohabit with the termite.\n\n==Description==\nThe nests of ''N. corniger'' are dark brown on the surface and have small bumps over their exterior. When small (less than 20&nbsp;cm in diameter) they tend to be [[sphere|spherical]] but as they grow they become more [[ellipse|elliptical]]. There may also be localised lobes on the surface of the nest. The queen lives in a chamber located in the centre of the nest, (often near the tree trunk or branch to which the nest is attached), that is up to 8&nbsp;cm wide and 1&nbsp;cm high and heavily reinforced. The thickness of the walls in the nest decreases away from the queen and towards the exterior although if the nest is attacked by predators then the walls will be reinforced. In one study of their nests the heaviest nest identified weighed 28 kilograms and measured 68&nbsp;cm by 46&nbsp;cm by 34&nbsp;cm.<ref name=thorne>{{cite journal | last1 = Thorne | first1 = Barbara L. | year = 1980 | title = Differences in Nest Architecture Between the Neotropical Arboreal Termites, Nasutitermes corniger and Nasutitermes ephratae(Isoptera: Termitidae) | url = http://psyche.entclub.org/87/87-235.html | journal = Psyche | volume = 87 | issue = 3\u20134| pages = 235\u2013244 | doi=10.1155/1980/12305}}</ref>\n\n[[Alate|Fertile individuals]] of ''N. corniger'' have black wings, dark bodies, and [[ocelli]] which are located relatively far from the eyes.<ref name=thorne/>\n\n==Social behavior==\nTermite colonies are examples of [[eusocial]] insects. Eusocial insects are animals that develop large, multigenerational cooperative societies that assist each other in the rearing of young, often at the cost of an individual\u2019s life or reproductive ability. Such altruism is explained in that eusocial insects benefit from giving up reproductive ability of many individuals to improve the overall fitness of closely related offspring. [[Kin selection|Hamilton\u2019s rule]] is the key to explaining this phenomenon, where altruism is justified evolutionarily when the benefit to the individual receiving the help, weighted by the relatedness to said individual, outweighs the cost to the organism being altruistic.\nIn most cases, termites included, individuals specialize to fill different needs that the overall colony may have. These are called castes. In ''Nasutitermes'' as well as most other termite species, there are three main castes: reproductive [[alate]]s, workers, and soldiers.\n\n===Fortress defense===\nThe benefits to being altruistic come in two ecological modes: \u201clife insurers\u201d and \u201cfortress defenders\u201d.<ref>{{cite journal | title= Kin selection and social insects | journal=Bioscience | jstor=1313262 | volume=48 | issue=3 | pages=165\u2013175| last1=Queller | first1=David C. | last2=Strassmann | first2=Joan E. | year=1998 | doi=10.2307/1313262 }}</ref> Most [[Hymenoptera]], the large majority of social insects, are life insurers, where eusociality is adapted as a safeguard from decreased life expectancy of offspring.<ref>{{cite journal | pmc = 287102 | pmid=16594034 | volume=86 | issue=9 | title=The evolution of eusociality: Reproductive head starts of workers | journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A | pages=3224\u20136 | last1 = Queller | first1 = DC | doi=10.1073/pnas.86.9.3224| year=1989 }}</ref> Termites, as fortress defenders, benefit from working together to best exploit a valuable ecological resource, in the case of ''Nasutitermes corniger'' a vast wood gallery.

He was a disciple of French Socialist leader [[Jean Jaur\u00e8s]] and after 1914 became his successor. As Prime Minister in a [[Popular Front (France)|Popular Front]] government of the left 1936-37, he provided a series of major economic reforms. Blum declared neutrality in the [[Spanish Civil War]] (1936\u201339) to avoid the civil conflict spilling over into France itself. Once out of office in 1938, he denounced the appeasement of Germany. When Germany [[Fall of France|defeated France]] in 1940, he became a staunch opponent of [[Vichy France]]. Tried by Vichy on trumped-up charges, he was imprisoned in [[Buchenwald]]  concentration camp. After the war he resumed a transitional leadership role in French politics, helping to bring about the [[French Fourth Republic]], until his death in 1950.\n\n==Early life==\n\nBlum was born in 1872 in Paris to a prosperous, assimilated [[Jewish]] family. His father Abraham, a merchant, was born in [[Alsace]]. Blum attended the [[\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure]] and [[The University of Paris]] and became both a lawyer and literary critic.\n\n==First political experiences==\n{{Refimprove section|date=September 2015}}\nWhile in his youth an avid reader<ref>Joel Colton, ''Leon Blum: Humanist in Politics'', 1987, 20.</ref> of the works of the nationalist writer [[Maurice Barr\u00e8s]], Blum had little interest in politics until the [[Dreyfus Affair]] of 1894, which had a traumatic effect on him as it did on many [[History of the Jews in France|French Jews]]. Campaigning as a Dreyfusard brought him into contact with the socialist leader [[Jean Jaur\u00e8s]], whom he greatly admired. He began contributing to the socialist daily, ''[[L'Humanit\u00e9]]'', and joined the [[French Section of the Workers' International|Socialist Party]], then called the SFIO. Soon he was the party's main theoretician.\n\nIn July 1914, just as the First World War broke out, Jaur\u00e8s was assassinated, and Blum became more active in the Socialist party leadership. In August 1914 Blum became assistant to the Socialist Minister of Public Works [[Marcel Sembat]]. In 1919 he was chosen as chair of the party's executive committee, and was also elected to the [[French National Assembly|National Assembly]] as a representative of Paris. Believing that there was no such thing as a \"good dictatorship\", he opposed participation in the [[Comintern]]. Therefore, in 1920, he worked to prevent a split between supporters and opponents of the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]], but the radicals seceded, taking ''[[L'Humanit\u00e9]]'' with them, and formed the [[French Communist Party|SFIC]].\n\nBlum led the SFIO through the 1920s and 1930s, and was also editor of the party's newspaper, ''Le Populaire''. In 1925, Blum gave a speech in favour of France's ''[[mission civilisatrice]]'' arguing that it was \"the right and even the duty of superior races to attract those who have not arrived at the same degree of culture and to call them to the progress realised thanks to the efforts of sciences and industry ... We have too much love for our country to disavow the expansion of its thought, of the French civilisation\".<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Katz | first1 = Jonathan | year = 2001 | title = The 1907 Mauchamp Affair and the French Civilising Mission in Morocco | url = | journal = The Journal of North African Studies | volume = 6 | issue = 1| page = 145 }}</ref>\n\n==The Popular Front government 1936-1940==\n{{main article|Popular Front (France)}}\n\nBlum was elected as Deputy for [[Narbonne]] in 1929, and was re-elected in 1932 and 1936. In 1933, he expelled [[Marcel D\u00e9at]], [[Pierre Renaudel]], and other [[neosocialism|neosocialists]] from the SFIO. Political circumstances changed in 1934, when the rise of German dictator [[Adolf Hitler]] and [[6 February 1934 crisis#The riots|fascist riots in Paris]] caused [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] and the French Communists to change their policy. In 1935 all the parties of left and centre formed the [[Popular Front (France)|Popular Front]]. France had not successfully recovered from the worldwide economic depression, wages had fallen and the working class demanded reforms. The Popular Front won a sweeping victory In June 1936. The Popular Front won a solid majority with 386 seats out of 608.  For the first time, the Socialists won more seats than the Radicals; they formed an effective coalition. As Socialist leader Blum became [[Prime Minister of France]], the first socialist to hold that office. His first cabinet consisted of 20 Socialists, 13 Radicals and two Socialist Republicans. The Communists won 15 percent of the vote, and 12 percent of the seats. They supported the government, although they refused to take any cabinet positions. For the first time, the cabinet included three women in minor roles, even though women were not able to vote.<ref>Julian T.

The strikes were spontaneous and unorganised, but nevertheless the business community panicked and met secretly with Blum, who negotiated a series of reforms, and then gave labour unions the credit for the [[Matignon Accords (1936)|Matignon Accords]].<ref>Adrian Rossiter, \"Popular Front economic policy and the Matignon negotiations\". ''Historical Journal'' 30#3 (1987): 663-684. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/263916 in JSTOR]</ref> The new laws:\n* gave workers the [[right to strike]]\n* initiated [[collective bargaining]]\n* legislated the mandating of 12 days of paid [[annual leave]] \n* legislated a 40 hour working week (outside of overtime)\n* raised wages (15% for the lowest-paid workers, and 7% for the relatively well-paid)\n* stipulated that employers would recognise [[shop stewards]].\n* ensured that there would be no retaliation against strikers.\n\nThe government legislated its promised reforms as rapidly as possible. On 11 June, the Chamber of Deputies voted for the forty-hour workweek, the restoration of civil servants' salaries, and two weeks' paid holidays, by a majority of 528 to 7. The Senate voted in favour of these laws within a week.<ref>Jackson, ''Popular Front in France'' p 288</ref>\n\nBlum persuaded the workers to accept pay raises and go back to work. Wages increased sharply; in two years the national average was up 48 percent. However inflation also rose 46%. The imposition of the 40-hour week proved highly inefficient, as industry had a difficult time adjusting to it.<ref>Larkin, ''France since the popular front: government and people, 1936-1996'' (1997) pp. 55\u201357</ref> The economic confusion hindered the rearmament effort, and the rapid growth of German armaments alarmed Blum. He launched a major program to speed up arms production. The cost forced the abandonment of the social reform programmes that the Popular Front had counted heavily on.<ref>Martin Thomas, \"French Economic Affairs and Rearmament: The First Crucial Months, June\u2013September 1936\". ''Journal of Contemporary History'' 27#4 (1992)  pp: 659\u2013670 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/260947 in JSTOR].</ref>\n\n===Additional reforms===\nBy mid-August 1936 the parliament had voted for:\n\n* the creation of a national ''Office du bl\u00e9'' (Grain Board or Wheat Office, through which the government helped to market agricultural produce at fair prices for farmers) to stabilise prices and curb speculation\n* the nationalisation of the arms industries\n* loans to small and medium-sized industries\n* the raising of the compulsory school-attendance age to 14 years\n* a major public works programme\n\nIt also raised the pay, pensions, and allowances of public-sector workers and ex-servicemen. The 1920 Sales Tax, opposed by the Left as  a tax on consumers, was abolished and replaced by a production tax, which was considered to be a tax on the producer instead of the consumer.\n\nBlum dissolved the far-right fascist leagues. In turn the Popular Front was actively fought by right-wing and far-right movements, which often used antisemitic slurs against Blum and other Jewish ministers. The [[La Cagoule|Cagoule]] far-right group even staged bombings to disrupt the government.\n\n===Spanish Civil War===\n\nThe [[Spanish Civil War]] broke out in July 1936 and deeply divided France. Blum adopted a policy of neutrality rather than assisting his ideological fellows, the Spanish Left-leaning Republicans. He acted from fear of splitting his domestic alliance with the centrist Radicals, or even precipitating an ideological civil war inside France. His refusal to send arms to Spain strained his alliance with the Communists, who followed Soviet policy and demanded all-out support for the [[Second Spanish Republic|Spanish Republic]]. The impossible dilemma caused by this issue led Blum to resign in June 1937.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Windell | first1 = George C. | year = 1962 | title = Leon Blum and the Crisis over Spain, 1936 | url = | journal = Historian | volume = 24 | issue = 4| pages = 423\u2013449 }}</ref>  All the constituents of the French left supported the Republican government in Madrid, while the right supported the Nationalist insurgents. Blum's cabinet was deeply divided and he decided on a policy of [[Non-Intervention Committee|non-intervention]], and collaborated with Britain and 25 other countries to formalize an agreement against sending any munitions or volunteer soldiers to Spain.  The Air Minister defied the cabinet and secretly sold warplanes to Madrid.  Jackson concludes that the French government \"was virtually paralyzed by the menace of civil war at home, the German danger abroad, and the weakness of her own defenses.\"<ref>Gabriel Jackson, ''The Spanish Republic in the Civil War, 1931-1939'' (1965) p 254</ref> The Republicans by 1938 were losing badly (they gave up in 1939), sending upwards of 500,000 political refugees across the border into France, where they were held in camps.<ref>Louis Stein, ''Beyond Death and Exile: The Spanish Republicans in France, 1939-1955'' (1980)</ref>\n\n===Attacks on Blum===\nOn 13 February 1936, shortly before becoming Prime Minister, Blum was dragged from a car and almost beaten to death by the [[Camelots du Roi]], a group of antisemites and royalists. The group's parent organisation, the right-wing [[Action Fran\u00e7aise]] league, was dissolved by the government following this incident, not long before the elections that brought Blum to power.<ref>[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2102-1728229,00.html The Times | UK News, World News and Opinion<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Blum became the first socialist and the first Jew to serve as [[Prime Minister of France]]. As such he was an object of particular hatred from [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]] elements.<ref>[http://judaisme.sdv.fr/perso/lblum/lblum.htm L\u00e9on BLUM 1872 - 1950] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060903174124/http://judaisme.sdv.fr/perso/lblum/lblum.htm |date=3 September 2006 }}, Lazare Landau, Extrait de l'Almanach du KKL-Strasbourg 5753-1993 (avec l'aimable autorisation des Editeurs), at Le judaisme alsacien</ref>\n\nIn its short life, the Popular Front government passed important legislation, including the 40-hour week, 12 paid annual holidays for the workers, collective bargaining on wage claims, and the full [[nationalisation]] of the  armament and  military aviation industries. This latter sweeping action had the unanticipated effect of disrupting the production of armaments at the wrong time, only three years away from the beginning of war in September 1939. Blum also attempted to pass legislation extending the rights of the Arab population of [[Algeria]], but this was blocked by \"colons\", colonist representatives in the Chamber and Senate.<ref>Joel Colton.  ''Leon Blum:  Humanist in Politics'' (1966) p 162.</ref>\n\n===The second Government, 1938, and its collapse===\nBlum was briefly Prime Minister again in March and April 1938, long enough to ship [[Artillery|heavy artillery]] and other much needed military equipment to the [[Spanish Republican]]s.<ref>Jean Lacouture, ''Leon Blum'' (New York, Holmes & Meier, 1982) p. 349.</ref>  He was unable to establish a stable ministry; on 10 April 1938, his socialist government fell and he was removed from office.\n \nIn foreign policy, his government was torn between the traditional anti-militarism of the [[French Left]] and the urgency of the rising threat of [[Nazi Germany]]. The government cooperated with Britain and declared war on Germany when it [[Invasion of Poland|invaded Poland]] in September 1939. Eight months of [[Phoney War]] thereafter, saw little or no movement. Suddenly in the spring of 1940, the Germans [[Battle of France|invaded France]] and defeated the French and British armies in a matter of weeks.  The [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]] [[Dunkirk evacuation|evacuated from Dunkirk, taking many French soldiers along]]. France gave up, signing an [[Armistice of 22 June 1940|armistice]] that gave Germany [[Occupied France|full control over much of France]], with a rump [[Vichy France|Vichy government]] in control of the remainder as well as of the [[French colonial empire]] and the [[French Navy]]. The same [[French Parliament|Parliament]] that had sponsored the Popular Front program since 1936 remained in power; it voted overwhelmingly to make Marshal [[Philippe P\u00e9tain]] a dictator and reverse all of the gains of the [[French Third Republic]].\n\nMany historians judge the Popular Front a failure in terms of economics, foreign policy, and long-term stability.  \"Disappointment and failure,\" says Jackson, \"was the legacy of the Popular Front.\"<ref>Julian Jackson, ''Popular Front in France: Defending Democracy 1934\u20131938'' (1988), pp 172, 215, 278-87, quotation on page 287.</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Bernard and Dubief |title=The Decline of the Third Republic, 1914-1938 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xFLMJnHQaGwC&pg=PA328 |year=1988 |pages=328\u201333}}</ref> There is general agreement that at first it created enormous excitement and expectation on the left, but in the end it failed to live up to its promise.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Irwin M. |last=Wall |title=Teaching the Popular Front |journal=History Teacher |year=1987 |volume=20 |issue=3 |pages=361\u2013378 |jstor=493125 }}</ref>\n\n==Second World War==\n[[Image:Leon Blum memorial in kibbutz kfar blum, Israel.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Leon Blum memorial in kibbutz Kfar Blum, Israel]]\nWhen the Germans occupied France in June 1940, Blum made no effort to leave the country, despite the extreme danger he was in as a Jew and a socialist leader; instead of fleeing the country, he escaped to southern France, but the French ordered his arrest. Blum was imprisoned in [[Fort du Portalet]] in the [[Pyrenees]].<ref>[http://www.tourisme-aspe.com/fort-du-portalet.html Fort du Portalet Office de tourisme Vall\u00e9e d'Aspe (www.tourisme-aspe.com)]</ref>\n\nBlum was among \"[[The Vichy 80]]\", a minority of parliamentarians that refused to grant full powers to Marshal P\u00e9tain. He was arrested by the authorities in September and held until 1942, when he was put on trial in the [[Riom Trial]] on charges of treason, for having \"weakened France's defenses\" by ordering her arsenal shipped to Spain, leaving France's infantry unsupported by heavy artillery on the eastern front against Nazi Germany. He used the courtroom to make a \u201cbrilliant indictment\u201d<ref>[http://tabletmag.com/jewish-arts-and-culture/books/191014/leon-blum-sponsored-yale-up An excerpt from [[Pierre Birnbaum]]\u2019s new biography of the French titan]</ref> of the French military and pro-German politicians like [[Pierre Laval]]. The trial was such an embarrassment to the Vichy regime that the Germans ordered it called off. He was transferred to German custody and imprisoned in Germany until 1945.\n\nIn April 1943, the occupying Government had Blum imprisoned in [[Buchenwald concentration camp|Buchenwald]] in the section reserved for high-ranking prisoners. His future wife, [[Jeanne Blum|Jeanne Ad\u00e8le \"Janot\" Levylier]], chose to come to the camp voluntarily to live with him inside the camp, and they were married there. As the Allied armies approached Buchenwald, he was transferred to [[Dachau concentration camp|Dachau]], near [[Munich]], and in late April 1945, [[Transport of concentration camp inmates to Tyrol|together with other notable inmates]], to [[State of Tyrol|Tyrol]]. In the last weeks of the war the [[Nazi]] regime gave orders that he was to be executed {{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}, but the local authorities decided not to obey them. Blum was rescued by Allied troops in May 1945. While in prison he wrote his best-known work, the essay ''\u00c0 l'\u00e9chelle humaine'' (\"On a human scale\").\n\nHis brother [[Ren\u00e9 Blum (ballet)|Ren\u00e9]], the founder of the Ballet de l'Op\u00e9ra \u00e0 [[Monte Carlo]], was arrested in Paris in 1942. He was deported to [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]] where, according to the [[Vrba-Wetzler report]], he was tortured and killed in April 1943.\n\n==Post-war period==\n[[File:L\u00e9on Blum reading.jpg|thumb|L\u00e9on Blum, before 1945]]\nAfter the war, L\u00e9on Blum returned to politics, and was again briefly Prime Minister in the transitional postwar coalition government. He advocated an alliance between the center-left and the center-right parties in order to support the [[French Fourth Republic|Fourth Republic]] against the Gaullists and the Communists.

affair]] of the late 19th century. He was a disciple of French Socialist leader [[Jean Jaur\u00e8s]] and after 1914 became his successor. As Prime Minister in a [[Popular Front (France)|Popular Front]] government of the left 1936-37, he provided a series of major economic reforms. Blum declared neutrality in the [[Spanish Civil War]] (1936\u201339) to avoid the civil conflict spilling over into France itself. Once out of office in 1938, he denounced the appeasement of Germany. When Germany [[Fall of France|defeated France]] in 1940, he became a staunch opponent of [[Vichy France]]. Tried by Vichy on trumped-up charges, he was imprisoned in [[Buchenwald]]  concentration camp. After the war he resumed a transitional leadership role in French politics, helping to bring about the [[French Fourth Republic]], until his death in 1950.\n\n==Early life==\n\nBlum was born in 1872 in Paris to a prosperous, assimilated [[Jewish]] family. His father Abraham, a merchant, was born in [[Alsace]]. Blum attended the [[\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure]] and [[The University of Paris]] and became both a lawyer and literary critic.\n\n==First political experiences==\n{{Refimprove section|date=September 2015}}\nWhile in his youth an avid reader<ref>Joel Colton, ''Leon Blum: Humanist in Politics'', 1987, 20.</ref> of the works of the nationalist writer [[Maurice Barr\u00e8s]], Blum had little interest in politics until the [[Dreyfus Affair]] of 1894, which had a traumatic effect on him as it did on many [[History of the Jews in France|French Jews]]. Campaigning as a Dreyfusard brought him into contact with the socialist leader [[Jean Jaur\u00e8s]], whom he greatly admired. He began contributing to the socialist daily, ''[[L'Humanit\u00e9]]'', and joined the [[French Section of the Workers' International|Socialist Party]], then called the SFIO. Soon he was the party's main theoretician.\n\nIn July 1914, just as the First World War broke out, Jaur\u00e8s was assassinated, and Blum became more active in the Socialist party leadership. In August 1914 Blum became assistant to the Socialist Minister of Public Works [[Marcel Sembat]]. In 1919 he was chosen as chair of the party's executive committee, and was also elected to the [[French National Assembly|National Assembly]] as a representative of Paris. Believing that there was no such thing as a \"good dictatorship\", he opposed participation in the [[Comintern]]. Therefore, in 1920, he worked to prevent a split between supporters and opponents of the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]], but the radicals seceded, taking ''[[L'Humanit\u00e9]]'' with them, and formed the [[French Communist Party|SFIC]].\n\nBlum led the SFIO through the 1920s and 1930s, and was also editor of the party's newspaper, ''Le Populaire''. In 1925, Blum gave a speech in favour of France's ''[[mission civilisatrice]]'' arguing that it was \"the right and even the duty of superior races to attract those who have not arrived at the same degree of culture and to call them to the progress realised thanks to the efforts of sciences and industry ... We have too much love for our country to disavow the expansion of its thought, of the French civilisation\".<ref>Katz, Jonathan. \"The 1907 Mauchamp Affair and the French Civilising Mission in Morocco.\" The Journal of North African Studies 6.1 (2001), 145 </ref>\n\n==The Popular Front government 1936-1940==\n{{main article|Popular Front (France)}}\n\nBlum was elected as Deputy for [[Narbonne]] in 1929, and was re-elected in 1932 and 1936. In 1933, he expelled [[Marcel D\u00e9at]], [[Pierre Renaudel]], and other [[neosocialism|neosocialists]] from the SFIO. Political circumstances changed in 1934, when the rise of German dictator [[Adolf Hitler]] and [[6 February 1934 crisis#The riots|fascist riots in Paris]] caused [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] and the French Communists to change their policy. In 1935 all the parties of left and centre formed the [[Popular Front (France)|Popular Front]]. France had not successfully recovered from the worldwide economic depression, wages had fallen and the working class demanded reforms. The Popular Front won a sweeping victory In June 1936. The Popular Front won a solid majority with 386 seats out of 608.  For the first time, the Socialists won more seats than the Radicals; they formed an effective coalition. As Socialist leader Blum became [[Prime Minister of France]], the first socialist to hold that office. His first cabinet consisted of 20 Socialists, 13 Radicals and two Socialist Republicans. The Communists won 15 percent of the vote, and 12 percent of the seats. They supported the government, although they refused to take any cabinet positions. For the first time, the cabinet included three women in minor roles, even though women were not able to vote.<ref>Julian T. Jackson, ''Popular Front in France: Defending Democracy 1934\u20131938'' (1988)</ref><ref>Jean Lacouture, ''Leon Blum'' (1982) pp 235-304</ref><ref>Maurice Larkin, ''France since the popular front: government and people, 1936-1996'' (1997) pp. 45-62</ref>\n\n===Labour policies===\nThe election of the left-wing government brought a wave of strikes, involving two million workers, and their seizure of many factories. The strikes were spontaneous and unorganised, but nevertheless the business community panicked and met secretly with Blum, who negotiated a series of reforms, and then gave labour unions the credit for the [[Matignon Accords (1936)|Matignon Accords]].<ref>Adrian Rossiter, \"Popular Front economic policy and the Matignon negotiations\". ''Historical Journal'' 30#3 (1987): 663-684. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/263916 in JSTOR]</ref> The new laws:\n* gave workers the [[right to strike]]\n* initiated [[collective bargaining]]\n* legislated the mandating of 12 days of paid [[annual leave]] \n* legislated a 40 hour working week (outside of overtime)\n* raised wages (15% for the lowest-paid workers, and 7% for the relatively well-paid)\n* stipulated that employers would recognise [[shop stewards]].\n* ensured that there would be no retaliation against strikers.\n\nThe government legislated its promised reforms as rapidly as possible. On 11 June, the Chamber of Deputies voted for the forty-hour workweek, the restoration of civil servants' salaries, and two weeks' paid holidays, by a majority of 528 to 7. The Senate voted in favour of these laws within a week.<ref>Jackson, ''Popular Front in France'' p 288</ref>\n\nBlum persuaded the workers to accept pay raises and go back to work. Wages increased sharply; in two years the national average was up 48 percent. However inflation also rose 46%. The imposition of the 40-hour week proved highly inefficient, as industry had a difficult time adjusting to it.<ref>Larkin, ''France since the popular front: government and people, 1936-1996'' (1997) pp. 55\u201357</ref> The economic confusion hindered the rearmament effort, and the rapid growth of German armaments alarmed Blum. He launched a major program to speed up arms production. The cost forced the abandonment of the social reform programmes that the Popular Front had counted heavily on.<ref>Martin Thomas, \"French Economic Affairs and Rearmament: The First Crucial Months, June\u2013September 1936\". ''Journal of Contemporary History'' 27#4 (1992)  pp: 659\u2013670 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/260947 in JSTOR].</ref>\n\n===Additional reforms===\nBy mid-August 1936 the parliament had voted for:\n\n* the creation of a national ''Office du bl\u00e9'' (Grain Board or Wheat Office, through which the government helped to market agricultural produce at fair prices for farmers) to stabilise prices and curb speculation\n* the nationalisation of the arms industries\n* loans to small and medium-sized industries\n* the raising of the compulsory school-attendance age to 14 years\n* a major public works programme\n\nIt also raised the pay, pensions, and allowances of public-sector workers and ex-servicemen. The 1920 Sales Tax, opposed by the Left as  a tax on consumers, was abolished and replaced by a production tax, which was considered to be a tax on the producer instead of the consumer.\n\nBlum dissolved the far-right fascist leagues. In turn the Popular Front was actively fought by right-wing and far-right movements, which often used antisemitic slurs against Blum and other Jewish ministers. The [[La Cagoule|Cagoule]] far-right group even staged bombings to disrupt the government.\n\n===Spanish Civil War===\n\nThe [[Spanish Civil War]] broke out in July 1936 and deeply divided France. Blum adopted a policy of neutrality rather than assisting his ideological fellows, the Spanish Left-leaning Republicans. He acted from fear of splitting his domestic alliance with the centrist Radicals, or even precipitating an ideological civil war inside France. His refusal to send arms to Spain strained his alliance with the Communists, who followed Soviet policy and demanded all-out support for the [[Second Spanish Republic|Spanish Republic]]. The impossible dilemma caused by this issue led Blum to resign in June 1937.<ref>George C. Windell, \"Leon Blum and the Crisis over Spain, 1936,\" ''Historian'' (1962) 24#4 pp 423-449</ref>  All the constituents of the French left supported the Republican government in Madrid, while the right supported the Nationalist insurgents. Blum's cabinet was deeply divided and he decided on a policy of [[Non-Intervention Committee|non-intervention]], and collaborated with Britain and 25 other countries to formalize an agreement against sending any munitions or volunteer soldiers to Spain.  The Air Minister defied the cabinet and secretly sold warplanes to Madrid.  Jackson concludes that the French government \"was virtually paralyzed by the menace of civil war at home, the German danger abroad, and the weakness of her own defenses.\"<ref>Gabriel Jackson, ''The Spanish Republic in the Civil War, 1931-1939'' (1965) p 254</ref> The Republicans by 1938 were losing badly (they gave up in 1939), sending upwards of 500,000 political refugees across the border into France, where they were held in camps.<ref>Louis Stein, ''Beyond Death and Exile: The Spanish Republicans in France, 1939-1955'' (1980)</ref>\n\n===Attacks on Blum===\nOn 13 February 1936, shortly before becoming Prime Minister, Blum was dragged from a car and almost beaten to death by the [[Camelots du Roi]], a group of antisemites and royalists.

This latter sweeping action had the unanticipated effect of disrupting the production of armaments at the wrong time, only three years away from the beginning of war in September 1939. Blum also attempted to pass legislation extending the rights of the Arab population of [[Algeria]], but this was blocked by \"colons\", colonist representatives in the Chamber and Senate.<ref>Joel Colton.  ''Leon Blum:  Humanist in Politics'' (1966) p 162.</ref>\n\n===The second Government, 1938, and its collapse===\nBlum was briefly Prime Minister again in March and April 1938, long enough to ship [[Artillery|heavy artillery]] and other much needed military equipment to the [[Spanish Republican]]s.<ref>Jean Lacouture, ''Leon Blum'' (New York, Holmes & Meier, 1982) p. 349.</ref>  He was unable to establish a stable ministry; on 10 April 1938, his socialist government fell and he was removed from office.\n \nIn foreign policy, his government was torn between the traditional anti-militarism of the [[French Left]] and the urgency of the rising threat of [[Nazi Germany]]. The government cooperated with Britain and declared war on Germany when it [[Invasion of Poland|invaded Poland]] in September 1939. Eight months of [[Phoney War]] thereafter, saw little or no movement. Suddenly in the spring of 1940, the Germans [[Battle of France|invaded France]] and defeated the French and British armies in a matter of weeks.  The [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]] [[Dunkirk evacuation|evacuated from Dunkirk, taking many French soldiers along]]. France gave up, signing an [[Armistice of 22 June 1940|armistice]] that gave Germany [[Occupied France|full control over much of France]], with a rump [[Vichy France|Vichy government]] in control of the remainder as well as of the [[French colonial empire]] and the [[French Navy]]. The same [[French Parliament|Parliament]] that had sponsored the Popular Front program since 1936 remained in power; it voted overwhelmingly to make Marshal [[Philippe P\u00e9tain]] a dictator and reverse all of the gains of the [[French Third Republic]].\n\nMany historians judge the Popular Front a failure in terms of economics, foreign policy, and long-term stability.  \"Disappointment and failure,\" says Jackson, \"was the legacy of the Popular Front.\"<ref>Julian Jackson, ''Popular Front in France: Defending Democracy 1934\u20131938'' (1988), pp 172, 215, 278-87, quotation on page 287.</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Bernard and Dubief |title=The Decline of the Third Republic, 1914-1938 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xFLMJnHQaGwC&pg=PA328 |year=1988 |pages=328\u201333}}</ref> There is general agreement that at first it created enormous excitement and expectation on the left, but in the end it failed to live up to its promise.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Irwin M. |last=Wall |title=Teaching the Popular Front |journal=History Teacher |year=1987 |volume=20 |issue=3 |pages=361\u2013378 |jstor=493125 }}</ref>\n\n==Second World War==\n[[Image:Leon Blum memorial in kibbutz kfar blum, Israel.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Leon Blum memorial in kibbutz Kfar Blum, Israel]]\nWhen the Germans occupied France in June 1940, Blum made no effort to leave the country, despite the extreme danger he was in as a Jew and a socialist leader; instead of fleeing the country, he escaped to southern France, but the French ordered his arrest. Blum was imprisoned in [[Fort du Portalet]] in the [[Pyrenees]].<ref>[http://www.tourisme-aspe.com/fort-du-portalet.html Fort du Portalet Office de tourisme Vall\u00e9e d'Aspe (www.tourisme-aspe.com)]</ref>\n\nBlum was among \"[[The Vichy 80]]\", a minority of parliamentarians that refused to grant full powers to Marshal P\u00e9tain. He was arrested by the authorities in September and held until 1942, when he was put on trial in the [[Riom Trial]] on charges of treason, for having \"weakened France's defenses\" by ordering her arsenal shipped to Spain, leaving France's infantry unsupported by heavy artillery on the eastern front against Nazi Germany. He used the courtroom to make a \u201cbrilliant indictment\u201d<ref>[http://tabletmag.com/jewish-arts-and-culture/books/191014/leon-blum-sponsored-yale-up An excerpt from [[Pierre Birnbaum]]\u2019s new biography of the French titan]</ref> of the French military and pro-German politicians like [[Pierre Laval]]. The trial was such an embarrassment to the Vichy regime that the Germans ordered it called off. He was transferred to German custody and imprisoned in Germany until 1945.\n\nIn April 1943, the occupying Government had Blum imprisoned in [[Buchenwald concentration camp|Buchenwald]] in the section reserved for high-ranking prisoners. His future wife, [[Jeanne Blum|Jeanne Ad\u00e8le \"Janot\" Levylier]], chose to come to the camp voluntarily to live with him inside the camp, and they were married there. As the Allied armies approached Buchenwald, he was transferred to [[Dachau concentration camp|Dachau]], near [[Munich]], and in late April 1945, [[Transport of concentration camp inmates to Tyrol|together with other notable inmates]], to [[State of Tyrol|Tyrol]]. In the last weeks of the war the [[Nazi]] regime gave orders that he was to be executed {{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}, but the local authorities decided not to obey them. Blum was rescued by Allied troops in May 1945. While in prison he wrote his best-known work, the essay ''\u00c0 l'\u00e9chelle humaine'' (\"On a human scale\").\n\nHis brother [[Ren\u00e9 Blum (ballet)|Ren\u00e9]], the founder of the Ballet de l'Op\u00e9ra \u00e0 [[Monte Carlo]], was arrested in Paris in 1942. He was deported to [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]] where, according to the [[Vrba-Wetzler report]], he was tortured and killed in April 1943.\n\n==Post-war period==\n[[File:L\u00e9on Blum reading.jpg|thumb|L\u00e9on Blum, before 1945]]\nAfter the war, L\u00e9on Blum returned to politics, and was again briefly Prime Minister in the transitional postwar coalition government. He advocated an alliance between the center-left and the center-right parties in order to support the [[French Fourth Republic|Fourth Republic]] against the Gaullists and the Communists. Although Blum's last government was very much an interim administration (lasting less than five weeks) it nevertheless succeeded in implementing a number of measures which helped to reduce the cost of living.<ref>A History of the Twentieth Century: Volume Two: 1933-1951 by Martin Gilbert</ref>\nBlum also served as Vice-Premier for one month in the summer of 1948 in the very short-lived government led by [[Andr\u00e9 Marie]].\n\nBlum also served as an ambassador on a government loan mission to the United States, and as head of the French mission to [[UNESCO]]. He continued to write for ''Le Populaire'' until his death at [[Jouy-en-Josas]], near Paris, on 30 March 1950.
