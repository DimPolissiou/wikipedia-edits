{"title_page": "World Institute for Development Economics Research", "text_new": "{{Portal|Politics}}\n'''The United Nations University World Institute for Development Economics Research''' ('''UNU-WIDER''') is part of the [[United Nations University]] (UNU). UNU-WIDER, the first research and training centre to be established by the UNU, is an international academic organization set up with the aim of promoting peace and progress by bringing together leading scholars from around the world to tackle pressing global problems.\n\n==UNU-WIDER==\n\n===The establishment of the UNU and UNU-WIDER===\nIn 1969 the UN Secretary General [[U Thant]] suggested that the time had arrived when serious consideration might be given to establishing an international university. An international university, the Secretary-General said, would be devoted to the Charter objectives of peace and progress. It would be staffed with professors from many nations and all parts of the world. The university would thus serve to break down the barriers that created misunderstanding and mistrust between nations and cultures.\n\nThe UNU was established by the General Assembly on 6 December 1973 to be an international community of scholars engaged in research, advanced training, and the dissemination of knowledge related to the pressing global problems of human survival, development, and welfare. The UNU started its activities in 1975 at its headquarters in Tokyo.\n\nThe UNU established UNU-WIDER following a brainstorming of leading economists of the day outlining the need for an institution to undertake a sustained effort for a more comprehensive understanding of the forces at work in the global economic system and their consequences for specific developing country situations and at the international level\n\nIn November 1983 Finland offered to host UNU-WIDER in its capital Helsinki, providing premises for the Institute and an endowment fund of US$25 million.\n\nUNU-WIDER was founded by a Host Country Agreement and Memorandum of Understanding signed by the then Foreign Minister of Finland, Paavo V\u00e4yrynen, and the Rector of UNU, Soedjatmoko, on the 4th of February 1984.\n\n===Mandate===\nUNU-WIDER's mandate is to undertake multidisciplinary research and policy analysis on structural changes affecting the living conditions of the world's poorest people; provide a forum for professional interaction and advocacy of policies leading to equitable and environmentally sustainable growth; and train researchers and government officials in the field of economic and social policy making.\n\n===History===\nFollowing the approval by the Finnish Parliament, the Host Country Agreement came into force on 20 June 1984. [[Lal Jayawardena]] was appointed the inaugural director the 1st of March in 1985, and the institute was initially located at premises at Annankatu 42C in Helsinki, Finland.\n\n====Research====\n\nDuring its existence UNU-WIDER has produced a large amount of research on the broad topics of poverty, inequality and growth. The Research Programme changes every two years. It is constructed by the Director in consultation with the UNU-WIDER Board following extensive discussions with UNU-WIDER research staff, leading economists, and donor government representatives. Areas of research have spanned all facets and levels of development economics including topics like; Finance and trade; economic growth and the environment; women and development; international migration and refugees; micro-simulation of tax benefit reforms; social impact of privatization; fiscal policies for growth; transition and institutions; development aid; global trends in inequality and poverty; personal assets from a global perspective and many more.  During the mid-1980s the Horn of Africa was confronting widespread famine. As this coincided with the launch of the very first UNU-WIDER research programme, the theme of \u201cHunger and Poverty: The Poorest Billion\u201d was included in it. This research was directed by Jean  Dr\u00e8ze and Nobel Laureate Amartya Sen. It has been argued that the resulting three volumes of study transformed the thinking on issues of famine and food security at the time. In the late 1990s WIDER undertook a major study of income inequality trends throughout the world under the direction of its then director Giovanni Andrea Cornia. The study uncovered so called \u201cnew causes\u201d of inequality linked to excessively liberal economic policies and the way in which economic reforms have been implemented. Furthermore, the study produced the first version of the [[World Income Inequality Database]]<ref>http://www.wider.unu.edu/research/Database/en_GB/database/</ref> (WIID). It is a comprehensive and freely available database of statistics on inequality trends within countries. Since 2009, under director Finn Tarp, UNU-WIDER has concentrated widely on the \u201ctriple crisis\u201d of food, climate change and finance.\n\n====Nobel laureates in economics associated with UNU-WIDER====\n\n[[Elinor Ostrom]], 2009\n\n[[Paul Krugman]], 2008\n\n[[Joseph E. Stiglitz]], 2001\n\n[[Amartya Sen]], 1998\n\n[[John C. Harsanyi]], 1994\n\n[[Douglass C. North]], 1993\n\n[[Robert W. Fogel]], 1993\n\n[[Robert M. Solow]], 1987\n\n====Other Nobel laureates and Prize winners connected with UNU-WIDER activities====\n\n[[Martti Ahtisaari]] ([[Nobel Peace Prize]], 2008)\n\n[[Edmund S. Phelps]] (2006)\n\n[[James A. Mirrlees]](1996)\n\n====Controversy====\nDuring the late 1980s and early 1990s the press reported on various financial and organisational irregularities about UNU-WIDER and its management.<ref>Sainio, Pentti: Operaatio Ahtisaari. Art House, 1993</ref><ref>Helsingin Sanomat, monthly supplement, 1993 February 6</ref><ref>Vihre\u00e4 Lanka (22.4.1993, issue 15, pp. 9-11)</ref>\n\n===Institutional framework===\n\nThe [http://unu.edu/council/ Council of UNU]  determines the principles and policies guiding the whole university. [http://www.wider.unu.edu/aboutus/institutional-framework/board/en_GB/list_board/ The Board of UNU-WIDER], comprising well-known economists, policy-makers, and social scientists from all over the world, advises on research and other activities. The Director of UNU-WIDER has overall responsibility for the research and management of the Institute, and implements the research programme in keeping with guidelines set out by the Board and the Council.\nUNU functions as a decentralized 'network of networks' with an interdisciplinary and global perspective. The UNU system comprises the UNU Centre in Tokyo and a worldwide network of Research and Training Centres and Programmes (RTC/Ps)  assisted by numerous associated and cooperating institutions.\n\n===Organization===\nResearch is coordinated by Helsinki-based staff consisting of resident researchers and  support staff. A network of external project directors, located at their universities or institutes, contribute to current projects along with several hundred network participants around the world. This group includes research staff from the [[United Nations University|UNU]], [[UN]], [[ECLAC]], [[UNDP]], [[FAO]], [[International Labour Organization]], the [[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development]] (UNCTAD), [[UNICEF]] and the [[Bretton Woods institutions]] including the [[World Bank]] and [[International Monetary Fund]]. Visiting scholars typically spend two to three months in Helsinki working on topics related to the current research programme. The internship programme allows PhD students in economics or related social sciences to spend two to three months at UNU-WIDER.\n\n====Funding====\nUNU-WIDER was founded with contributions from the governments of [[Finland]] and [[India]], the [[Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency]] (Sida), and the [[Nippon Foundation]] (Sasakawa Foundation, Japan). Income from the endowment fund has largely covered core expenditures. Supplementary financial support for research and other activities has been received from the governments of [[Denmark]], Finland, [[Italy]], [[Norway]], Sweden and the [[United Kingdom]]; the [[Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development]]( Kuwait), [[Ford Foundation]], [[Yrj\u00f6 Jahnsson Foundation]] (Finland), [[MacArthur Foundation]], [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]] (Finland), [[Rockefeller Foundation]], [[SITRA]] (Finnish National Fund for Research and Development), [[United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs]] (UN-DESA), [[United Nations Development Programme]] (UNDP), and the World Bank. In-kind contributions, such as assistance in hosting workshops and conferences, are also regularly received from various universities, United Nations agencies and other international organizations.\n\n===Directors===\nThe current director of UNU-WIDER is [[Finn Tarp]]. Tarp also holds the Chair of Professor of Development Economics at the Department of Economics at the University of Copenhagen, where he completed his MSc and PhD in Economics. Former directors include; [[Anthony Shorrocks]], [[Matti Pohjola]], [[Giovanni Andrea Cornia]], [[Mih\u00e1ly Simai]] and [[Lal Jayawardena]].\n\n==Activities==\n\n===Research===\n\nThe Research Programme is reformulated every two years by the Institute's director in consultation with the UNU-WIDER Board following extensive discussions with UNU-WIDER research staff, leading economists in the UN and elsewhere, and donor government representatives. Research projects are led by scholars (Research Fellows and External Project Directors) who elaborate the proposals before the projects are launched. Each project typically invites selected authors to write original research papers which are later presented and discussed at project workshops and conferences. In some cases, a more general 'call for papers' may be announced on the Institute's website.\nTypically, two large development conferences are organized annually in Helsinki, each of which brings together around 100 individuals to present papers and to discuss current problems on development issues. Participants are usually researchers and policy makers from the academic, government, and development communities. Special attempts are made to encourage researchers from developing countries and to achieve a gender balance at these events.\nThe research studies are published as [http://www.wider.unu.edu/publications/working-papers/en_GB/wider-working-papers/ WIDER working papers]. The outcomes also often include a [http://www.wider.unu.edu/publications/policy-briefs/en_GB/Policy-briefs/  policy brief] and an article in the [http://www.wider.unu.edu/publications/newsletter/en_GB/introduction-angle/  WIDER''Angle''].\n\n===Annual lecture===\nThe WIDER Annual Lecture is delivered by an eminent scholar who has made a significant contribution in the field of economics of development and transition.\n\n2013 [[Martti Ahtisaari]] - [http://www1.wider.unu.edu/AL17/ Egalitarian principles \u2013 the foundation for sustainable peace]\n\n2012 [[Lant Pritchett]] - [http://www.wider.unu.edu/publications/annual-lectures/en_GB/AL/_files/89647575484727362/default/Folk%20and%20the%20Formula%20-%20Fact%20and%20Fiction%20in%20Development_%20Lant%20Pritchett.pdf Folk and the Formula: Fact and Fiction in Development]\n\n2011 [[Justin Yifu Lin]] - [http://www.wider.unu.edu/publications/annual-lectures/en_GB/AL15/_files/86131928864587794/default/AL15%20final.pdf  From Flying Geese to Leading Dragons: New Opportunities and Strategies for Structural Transformation in Developing Countries]\n\n2010 [[Jos\u00e9 Antonio Ocampo]] - [http://www.wider.unu.edu/publications/annual-lectures/en_GB/AL14/_files/85615487616679947/default/WAL2011-14.pdf  Reforming the International Monetary System]\n\n2009 [[Ronald Findlay]] - [http://www.wider.unu.edu/publications/annual-lectures/en_GB/AL/_files/83425249343963314/default/AL13%20Findlay-on-the-web.pdf  The Trade-Development Nexus in Theory and History]\n\n2009 [[Deepak Nayyar]] - [http://www.wider.unu.edu/publications/annual-lectures/en_GB/AL/_files/84303348898267376/default/Annual%20Lecture%2012%20Final.pdf  Developing Countries in the World Economy: The Future in the Past?]\n\n2008 [[Kemal Dervi\u015f]] - [http://www.wider.unu.edu/publications/annual-lectures/en_GB/AL/_files/83425233416880284/default/annual-lecture-11-online.pdf  The Climate Change Challenge]\n\n2006 [[Angus Deaton]] - [http://www.wider.unu.edu/publications/annual-lectures/en_GB/AL/_files/83425235482509470/default/annual-lecture-2006.pdf  Global Patterns of Income and Health: Facts, Interpretations, and Policies]\n\n2005 [[Nancy Birdsall]] - [http://www.wider.unu.edu/publications/annual-lectures/en_GB/AL/_files/83425229745094810/default/annual-lecture-2005.pdf  The World is not Flat: Inequality and Injustice in our Global Economy]\n\n2004 [[Dani Rodrik]] - [http://www.wider.unu.edu/publications/annual-lectures/en_GB/AL/_files/83425227548524696/default/annual-lecture-2004.pdf  Rethinking Growth Strategies]\n\n2003 [[Kaushik Basu]] - [http://www.wider.unu.edu/publications/annual-lectures/en_GB/AL/_files/83425225096757398/default/annual-lecture-2003.pdf  Global Labour Standards and Local Freedoms]\n\n2002 [[Jeffrey G.

UNU-WIDER, the first research and training centre to be established by the UNU, is an international academic organization set up with the aim of promoting peace and progress by bringing together leading scholars from around the world to tackle pressing global problems.\n\n==UNU-WIDER==\n\n===The establishment of the UNU and UNU-WIDER===\nIn 1969 the UN Secretary General [[U Thant]] suggested that the time had arrived when serious consideration might be given to establishing an international university. An international university, the Secretary-General said, would be devoted to the Charter objectives of peace and progress. It would be staffed with professors from many nations and all parts of the world. The university would thus serve to break down the barriers that created misunderstanding and mistrust between nations and cultures.\n\nThe UNU was established by the General Assembly on 6 December 1973 to be an international community of scholars engaged in research, advanced training, and the dissemination of knowledge related to the pressing global problems of human survival, development, and welfare. The UNU started its activities in 1975 at its headquarters in Tokyo.\n\nThe UNU established UNU-WIDER following a brainstorming of leading economists of the day outlining the need for an institution to undertake a sustained effort for a more comprehensive understanding of the forces at work in the global economic system and their consequences for specific developing country situations and at the international level\n\nIn November 1983 Finland offered to host UNU-WIDER in its capital Helsinki, providing premises for the Institute and an endowment fund of US$25 million.\n\nUNU-WIDER was founded by a Host Country Agreement and Memorandum of Understanding signed by the then Foreign Minister of Finland, Paavo V\u00e4yrynen, and the Rector of UNU, Soedjatmoko, on the 4th of February 1984.\n\n===Mandate===\nUNU-WIDER's mandate is to undertake multidisciplinary research and policy analysis on structural changes affecting the living conditions of the world's poorest people; provide a forum for professional interaction and advocacy of policies leading to equitable and environmentally sustainable growth; and train researchers and government officials in the field of economic and social policy making.\n\n===History===\nFollowing the approval by the Finnish Parliament, the Host Country Agreement came into force on 20 June 1984. [[Lal Jayawardena]] was appointed the inaugural director the 1st of March in 1985, and the institute was initially located at premises at Annankatu 42C in Helsinki, Finland.\n\n====Research====\n\nDuring its existence UNU-WIDER has produced a large amount of research on the broad topics of poverty, inequality and growth. The Research Programme changes every two years. It is constructed by the Director in consultation with the UNU-WIDER Board following extensive discussions with UNU-WIDER research staff, leading economists, and donor government representatives. Areas of research have spanned all facets and levels of development economics including topics like; Finance and trade; economic growth and the environment; women and development; international migration and refugees; micro-simulation of tax benefit reforms; social impact of privatization; fiscal policies for growth; transition and institutions; development aid; global trends in inequality and poverty; personal assets from a global perspective and many more.  During the mid-1980s the Horn of Africa was confronting widespread famine. As this coincided with the launch of the very first UNU-WIDER research programme, the theme of \u201cHunger and Poverty: The Poorest Billion\u201d was included in it. This research was directed by Jean  Dr\u00e8ze and Nobel Laureate Amartya Sen. It has been argued that the resulting three volumes of study transformed the thinking on issues of famine and food security at the time. In the late 1990s WIDER undertook a major study of income inequality trends throughout the world under the direction of its then director Giovanni Andrea Cornia. The study uncovered so called \u201cnew causes\u201d of inequality linked to excessively liberal economic policies and the way in which economic reforms have been implemented. Furthermore, the study produced the first version of the [[World Income Inequality Database]]<ref>http://www.wider.unu.edu/research/Database/en_GB/database/</ref> (WIID). It is a comprehensive and freely available database of statistics on inequality trends within countries. Since 2009, under director Finn Tarp, UNU-WIDER has concentrated widely on the \u201ctriple crisis\u201d of food, climate change and finance.\n\n====Nobel laureates in economics associated with UNU-WIDER====\n\n[[Elinor Ostrom]], 2009\n\n[[Paul Krugman]], 2008\n\n[[Joseph E.

Art House, 1993</ref><ref>Helsingin Sanomat, monthly supplement, 1993 February 6</ref><ref>Vihre\u00e4 Lanka (22.4.1993, issue 15, pp. 9-11)</ref>\n\n===Institutional framework===\n\nThe [http://unu.edu/council/ Council of UNU]  determines the principles and policies guiding the whole university. [http://www.wider.unu.edu/aboutus/institutional-framework/board/en_GB/list_board/ The Board of UNU-WIDER], comprising well-known economists, policy-makers, and social scientists from all over the world, advises on research and other activities. The Director of UNU-WIDER has overall responsibility for the research and management of the Institute, and implements the research programme in keeping with guidelines set out by the Board and the Council.\nUNU functions as a decentralized 'network of networks' with an interdisciplinary and global perspective. The UNU system comprises the UNU Centre in Tokyo and a worldwide network of Research and Training Centres and Programmes (RTC/Ps)  assisted by numerous associated and cooperating institutions.\n\n===Organization===\nResearch is coordinated by Helsinki-based staff consisting of resident researchers and  support staff. A network of external project directors, located at their universities or institutes, contribute to current projects along with several hundred network participants around the world. This group includes research staff from the [[United Nations University|UNU]], [[UN]], [[ECLAC]], [[UNDP]], [[FAO]], [[International Labour Organization]], the [[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development]] (UNCTAD), [[UNICEF]] and the [[Bretton Woods institutions]] including the [[World Bank]] and [[International Monetary Fund]]. Visiting scholars typically spend two to three months in Helsinki working on topics related to the current research programme. The internship programme allows PhD students in economics or related social sciences to spend two to three months at UNU-WIDER.\n\n====Funding====\nUNU-WIDER was founded with contributions from the governments of [[Finland]] and [[India]], the [[Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency]] (Sida), and the [[Nippon Foundation]] (Sasakawa Foundation, Japan). Income from the endowment fund has largely covered core expenditures. Supplementary financial support for research and other activities has been received from the governments of [[Denmark]], Finland, [[Italy]], [[Norway]], Sweden and the [[United Kingdom]]; the [[Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development]]( Kuwait), [[Ford Foundation]], [[Yrj\u00f6 Jahnsson Foundation]] (Finland), [[MacArthur Foundation]], [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]] (Finland), [[Rockefeller Foundation]], [[SITRA]] (Finnish National Fund for Research and Development), [[United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs]] (UN-DESA), [[United Nations Development Programme]] (UNDP), and the World Bank. In-kind contributions, such as assistance in hosting workshops and conferences, are also regularly received from various universities, United Nations agencies and other international organizations.\n\n===Directors===\nThe current director of UNU-WIDER is [[Finn Tarp]].

While he is viewed as The Messiah Christ in his Kingly Character, Jesus Christ revealed in the personality of H.I.M Emperor Haile Selassie I the 1st, as God of the Bible in flesh represented through his place in the Holy Trinity. \n\nHowever some view [[Haile Selassie]], [[Emperor of Ethiopia]], is seen as a divinely anointed king in the lineage of Kings David and Solomon (Selassie's house being called the [[Solomonic dynasty]]). While he is considered a representation of \"The Messiyah in Kingly Character\", he is not seen as The Messiyah Himself, but as a representative of the everlasting [[Covenant (biblical)#Davidic covenant|Davidic covenant]], which is to be fulfilled by Yesus Kristos [[Second Coming|upon his return]] as The Conquering Lion of the Tribe of Judah (Yahudah). \n[[The Twelve Tribes]] symbology is based on Yahqob's ([[Jacob]]) 12 sons, and correspond to the months of the ancient Ysraylite ([[Israelite]]) calendar, beginning with April and [[Reuben (Bible)|Reuben]].<ref name=\"Summers\" /> The Most High [[Jah]]/[[Names of God in Judaism#Yah|Yah]]/[[YHWH]] gave Yahqob a new name which was Ysrayl ([[Israel]]). Some people further relate the 12 Tribes to [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] signs. Thus [[Bob Marley]] came from the Tribe of Yowseph ([[Joseph (Hebrew Bible)|Joseph]]), the eleventh of the biblical Ysrayl's (Israel's) twelve children (because he was born in February). The name [[Levi]] in [[Ijahman Levi]] represents the third child who was born to Yahqob ([[Jacob]]). Another well known [[reggae]] group of this organization is [[Israel Vibration]].\n\n[[Bob Marley]], by quoting a [[Bible|biblical]] passage about Yowseph (Joseph) on the album cover of ''Rastaman Vibration'', was acknowledging his own support for this sect.

(Hopkins, p.&nbsp;259).  Early missionaries and anthropologists named the Uganda/Rwanda clans, the Niyabinghi Cult, because their culture was based on the veneration of the goddess spirit, Niyabinghi. The Niyabinghi Cult is said to have thrived due to the possession of the goddess Niyabinghi through dance and religious seances. \n\nVarious oral traditions exist that explain how Niyabinghi became a revered goddess.  One account states that in 1700 C.E., two tribes inhabited the Uganda/Rwanda area: the Shambo and Bgeishekatwa.  Queen Kitami, who is said to have possessed a sacred drum of phenomenal power, ruled the Bgeishekatwa tribe.  When Kitami died, she was given immortal status and the name Niyabinghi (Freedman, p.&nbsp;63).  Another tradition states that Queen Niyabinghi ruled the Northwestern Tanzani kingdom of Karagwe and married the chief of Mpororo from the southwestern kingdom of Uganda.  Envious of the Queen's power, the ruler ordered her death which is said to have brought \"untold horrors to his kingdom\" (Kiyaga-Mulindwa, p.&nbsp;1163).  After her death, her spirit continued to be praised and to possess her followers for the next two centuries.\n\nThe Bgeishekatwa tribe was eventually defeated by the Shambo clan who adopted the Bgeishekatwa\u2019s rituals for Nyahbinghi.  A century later, the Shambo were defeated by the cultivating Kiga clan (there are legends that the Shambo\u2019s defeat is connected to the attempt to kill a woman who was possessed by Nyahbinghi) (Freedman, p.&nbsp;74).  Once the Kiga tribe reigned over the land, Niyabinghi became known as a matriarchal power, and the Kiga\u2019s century-rule is characterized as the reign of the Niyabinghi priestesses.\n\nKiga women who received Nyahbinghi\u2019s blessings and were said to be possessed by Nyahbinghi came to be called ''bagirwa'' (Hopkins, p.&nbsp;259).  Eventually, the revered ''bagirwa'' gained political dominion and became governors of the Kiga people, living a dual life of political and spiritual leadership.  The bagirwa, including Muhumusa, remained governors of the Kiga people until 1930 after losing their land to British, German, and Belgian imperialists, which they fought for a period of twenty years.  The singular form of the word \"bagirwa\" is \"mugirwa\". At some point, men became Nyahbinghi priests as well (Freedman, pp.&nbsp;80\u201381).\n\nThe Nyahbinghi Theocracy Government was named for a legendary [[Amazons|Amazon]] queen of the same name, who was said to have [[spiritual possession|possessed]] a [[Uganda]]n woman named [[Muhumusa]] in the 19th century. Muhumusa inspired a movement, rebelling against African colonial authorities.  Though she was captured in 1913, alleged possessions by \"Niyabinghi\" continued, mostly afflicting women.\n\nHowever, Nyahbinghi doesn't have any linkage to or relationship with Ethiopian history or Haile Selassie, it is a part of the Rastafari movement and a manifestation of the wisdom of Jah. Niyabinghi are considered the strictest mansion of the [[Rastafari movement]] in [[Jamaica]], preaching the ideals of a global theocracy to be headed by Emperor [[Haile Selassie|Haile Selassie I]], whom they proclaim to be the promised [[Messiah]] and incarnation of Jah, the Supreme.\n\nThey have also been known to be very [[anti-racist]]. But reflect a deep belief in the uplift of the black race. They also express that oppressors towards anybody will be punished by Jah. People of the Nyahbinghi faith often (but not always) affiliate themselves with [[nonviolence]]. while not necessarily approving of St. Augustine's other principles.\n\n=== Nyahbinghi music ===\nThe Niyabinghi resistance inspired a number of [[Jamaica]]n [[Rastafari movement|Rastafari]], who incorporated what are known as '''[[niyabinghi chants]]''' (also '''binghi''') into their celebrations (''groundations''). The [[rhythm]]s of these chants were eventually an influence of popular [[ska]], [[rocksteady]] and [[reggae]] music.  Three kinds of drums (called \"harps\") are used in niyabinghi: [[bass (sound)|bass]], also known as the \"Pope Smasher\" or \"Vatican Basher\", reflecting a Rasta association between Catholicism and [[Babylon]], the middle-pitched [[funde]] and [[akete]].  The akete (also known as the \"repeater\") plays an [[improvisation|improvised]] [[syncopation]], the funde plays a regular one-two beat and the bass drum strikes loudly on the first beat, and softly on the third beat (of four).  When groups of players get together, only one akete player may play at any one time.  The other drums keep regular rhythms while the akete players solo in the form of a conversation.\n\nNiyabinghi drumming is not exclusive to the Niyabinghi order, and is common to all Rastafari.  Its rhythms are the basis of Reggae music, through the influential ska band, the [[Skatalites]]. It is said that their drummer revolutionized Jamaican music by combining the various Niyabinghi parts into a 'complete' \"drum kit,\" which combined with jazz to create an entirely new form of music, known as [[Ska music|ska]].  Niyabinghi rhythms were largely a creation of Count Ossie, who incorporated influences from traditional Jamaican Kumina drumming (especially the form of the drums themselves) with songs and rhythms learned from the recordings of Nigerian musician [[Babatunde Olatunji]].\n\nBinghi chanting typically includes recitation of the [[Psalm]]s, but may also include variations of well-known Christian hymns.  Though Count Ossie is clearly the most influential Binghi drummer, practically inventing the genre, the recordings of [[Ras Michael]] and the [[Sons of Negus]], as well as the Rastafari Elders, have contributed to the popularity of the music.\n\nThough Niyabinghi music operates as a form of Rasta religious music outside of Reggae, musicians such as Bob Marley and even non-Rastas such [[Prince Buster]] (Muslim) and [[Jimmy Cliff]] used the idiom in some songs. Recently, dancehall sensation [[Sizzla]], American roots-Reggae artists such as [[Groundation]] and [[Rap music|Hip hop]] have used Niyabinghi drums extensively in their recordings. Though sometimes claimed to be a direct continuation of an African cultural form, Niyabinghi drumming is best seen as the voice of a people rediscovering their African roots.\n\nCombining Jamaican traditions with newly acquired African ones, Count Ossie and others synthesized his country's African traditions and reinvigorated them with the influences of Nigerian master-drummer [[Babatunde Olatunji]], as a comparison of Count Ossie's ''Tales of Mozambique'' and Olatunji's earlier ''[[Drums of Passion]]'' will reveal.  Indeed, it is that combination of inherited traditions and conscious rediscovery of lost African traditions that makes Niyabinghi drumming&mdash;and [[Rastafari movement|Rasta]]&mdash;so powerful.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n* Freedman, Jim.

While he is considered a representation of \"The Messiyah in Kingly Character\", he is not seen as The Messiyah Himself, but as a representative of the everlasting [[Covenant (biblical)#Davidic covenant|Davidic covenant]], which is to be fulfilled by Yesus Kristos [[Second Coming|upon his return]] as The Conquering Lion of the Tribe of Judah (Yahudah). \n[[The Twelve Tribes]] symbology is based on Yahqob's ([[Jacob]]) 12 sons, and correspond to the months of the ancient Ysraylite ([[Israelite]]) calendar, beginning with April and [[Reuben (Bible)|Reuben]].<ref name=\"Summers\" /> The Most High [[Jah]]/[[Names of God in Judaism#Yah|Yah]]/[[YHWH]] gave Yahqob a new name which was Ysrayl ([[Israel]]).

(Hopkins, p.&nbsp;259).  Early missionaries and anthropologists named the Uganda/Rwanda clans, the Niyabinghi Cult, because their culture was based on the veneration of the goddess spirit, Niyabinghi. The Niyabinghi Cult is said to have thrived due to the possession of the goddess Niyabinghi through dance and religious seances. \n\nVarious oral traditions exist that explain how Niyabinghi became a revered goddess.  One account states that in 1700 C.E., two tribes inhabited the Uganda/Rwanda area: the Shambo and Bgeishekatwa.  Queen Kitami, who is said to have possessed a sacred drum of phenomenal power, ruled the Bgeishekatwa tribe.  When Kitami died, she was given immortal status and the name Niyabinghi (Freedman, p.&nbsp;63).  Another tradition states that Queen Niyabinghi ruled the Northwestern Tanzani kingdom of Karagwe and married the chief of Mpororo from the southwestern kingdom of Uganda.  Envious of the Queen's power, the ruler ordered her death which is said to have brought \"untold horrors to his kingdom\" (Kiyaga-Mulindwa, p.&nbsp;1163).  After her death, her spirit continued to be praised and to possess her followers for the next two centuries.\n\nThe Bgeishekatwa tribe was eventually defeated by the Shambo clan who adopted the Bgeishekatwa\u2019s rituals for Nyahbinghi.  A century later, the Shambo were defeated by the cultivating Kiga clan (there are legends that the Shambo\u2019s defeat is connected to the attempt to kill a woman who was possessed by Nyahbinghi) (Freedman, p.&nbsp;74).  Once the Kiga tribe reigned over the land, Niyabinghi became known as a matriarchal power, and the Kiga\u2019s century-rule is characterized as the reign of the Niyabinghi priestesses.\n\nKiga women who received Nyahbinghi\u2019s blessings and were said to be possessed by Nyahbinghi came to be called ''bagirwa'' (Hopkins, p.&nbsp;259).  Eventually, the revered ''bagirwa'' gained political dominion and became governors of the Kiga people, living a dual life of political and spiritual leadership.  The bagirwa, including Muhumusa, remained governors of the Kiga people until 1930 after losing their land to British, German, and Belgian imperialists, which they fought for a period of twenty years.  The singular form of the word \"bagirwa\" is \"mugirwa\".

This proposes a range of plausible values for an unknown [[parameter]] (for example, the mean). The interval has an associated '''confidence level''' that the true parameter is in the proposed range. Given observations <math>x_1, \\ldots, x_n</math> and a confidence level <math>\\gamma</math>, a valid confidence interval has a <math>\\gamma</math> probability of containing the true underlying parameter. The level of confidence can be chosen by the investigator. In general terms, a confidence interval for an unknown parameter is based on sampling the [[Probability distribution|distribution]] of a corresponding [[estimator]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=A modern introduction to probability and statistics : understanding why and how|last=Dekking, F.M. (Frederik Michel), 1946-|date=2005|publisher=Springer|isbn=1-85233-896-2|oclc=783259968}}</ref>\n\nMore strictly speaking, the confidence level represents the [[frequency]] (i.e. the proportion) of possible confidence intervals that contain the true value of the unknown population parameter. In other words, if confidence intervals are constructed using a given confidence level from an infinite number of independent sample statistics, the proportion of those intervals that contain the true value of the parameter will be equal to the confidence level.<ref name=\"CH\" /><ref name=\"KS\" /><ref name=\"Neyman\" /> For example, if the confidence level (CL) is 90% then in hypothetical indefinite data collection, in 90% of the samples the interval estimate will contain the population parameter.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|title=Introductory statistics|last=Illowsky, Barbara|others=Dean, Susan L., 1945-, Illowsky, Barbara., OpenStax College|isbn=978-1-947172-05-0|location=Houston, Texas|oclc=899241574}}</ref>\n\nThe confidence level is designated prior to examining the data.

A larger sample will tend to produce a better estimate of the population parameter, when all other factors are equal. A higher confidence level will tend to produce a broader confidence interval.\n\nMany confidence intervals are of the form: <math>(t-c\\sigma_T, t+c\\sigma_T)</math>, where <math>t</math> is the realization of the dataset, c is a constant and <math>\\sigma_T</math> is the standard deviation of the dataset.<ref name=\":0\" /> Another way to express the form of confidence interval:\n\n(point estimate \u2013 error bound, point estimate + error bound)\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0or symbolically expressed, (\u2013EBM, +EBM)\n\nwhere (point estimate) serves as an estimate for m (the population mean) and EBM is the error bound for a population mean.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nThe margin of error (EBM) depends on the confidence level.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nA thorough, general definition:\n\nSuppose a dataset <math>x_1, \\ldots, x_n</math> is given, modeled as realization of random variables <math>X_1,\\ldots,X_n</math>.

The number <math>\\gamma</math> is called the ''confidence level''.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n{{toc limit|3}}\n\n== Conceptual basis ==\n\n[[File:Confidenceinterval.png|thumb|200px|In this [[bar chart]], the top ends of the brown bars indicate observed [[mean]]s and the red [[line segment]]s (\"error bars\") represent the confidence intervals around them. Although the error bars are shown as symmetric around the means, that is not always the case. It is also important to note that in most graphs, the error bars do not represent confidence intervals (e.g., they often represent standard errors or [[standard deviations]])]]\n\n=== Introduction ===\n\n[[Interval estimation]] can be contrasted with [[point estimation]]. A point estimate is a single value given as the estimate of a population parameter that is of interest, for example, the mean of some quantity. An interval estimate specifies instead a range within which the parameter is estimated to lie. Confidence intervals are commonly reported in tables or graphs along with point estimates of the same parameters, to show the [[Reliability (statistics)|reliability]] of the estimates.\n\nFor example, a confidence interval can be used to describe how reliable survey results are. In a poll of election\u2013voting intentions, the result might be that 40% of respondents intend to vote for a certain party. A 99% <!--this number is correct, do not change!-->confidence interval for the proportion in the whole population having the same intention on the survey might be 30% to 50%. From the same data one may calculate a 90% <!--this number is correct, do not change!-->confidence interval, which in this case might be 37% to 43%. A major factor determining the length of a confidence interval is the [[Sample size|size of the sample]] used in the estimation procedure, for example, the number of people taking part in a survey.\n\n=== Meaning and interpretation ===\n{{See also|#Practical example interpretation}}\n\nVarious interpretations of a confidence interval can be given (taking the 90% confidence interval as an example in the following).\n* The confidence interval can be expressed in terms of [[Sample (statistics)|samples]] (or [[Replication (statistics)|repeated samples]]): \"''Were this procedure to be repeated on numerous samples, the fraction of calculated confidence intervals (which would differ for each sample) that encompass the true population parameter would tend toward 90%.\"''<ref name=CH />\n* The confidence interval can be expressed in terms of a single sample: \"''There is a 90% [[Coverage probability|probability]] that the calculated confidence interval from some future experiment encompasses the true value of the population parameter.\"'' Note this is a probability statement about the confidence interval, not the population parameter. This considers the probability associated with a confidence interval from a pre-experiment point of view, in the same context in which arguments for the random allocation of treatments to study items are made. Here the experimenter sets out the way in which they intend to calculate a confidence interval and to know, before they do the actual experiment, that the interval they will end up calculating has a particular chance of covering the true but unknown value.<ref name=Neyman /> This is very similar to the \"repeated sample\" interpretation above, except that it avoids relying on considering hypothetical repeats of a sampling procedure that may not be repeatable in any meaningful sense. See [[Neyman construction]].\n* The explanation of a confidence interval can amount to something like: \"''The confidence interval represents values for the population parameter for which the difference between the parameter and the observed estimate is not [[statistically significant]] at the 10% level''\".<ref>Cox D.R., Hinkley D.V.

In fact, I have repeatedly stated that the frequency of correct results will tend to ''\u03b1''. Consider now the case when a sample is already drawn, and the calculations have given [particular limits]. Can we say that in this particular case the probability of the true value [falling between these limits] is equal to ''\u03b1''? The answer is obviously in the negative. The parameter is an unknown constant, and no probability statement concerning its value may be made...\"</blockquote>\n:Deborah Mayo expands on this further as follows:<ref name=Mayo /><blockquote>\"It must be stressed, however, that having seen the value [of the data], Neyman\u2013Pearson theory never permits one to conclude that the specific confidence interval formed covers the true value of 0 with either (1&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;''\u03b1'')100% probability or (1&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;''\u03b1'')100% degree of confidence. Seidenfeld's remark seems rooted in a (not uncommon) desire for Neyman\u2013Pearson confidence intervals to provide something which they cannot legitimately provide; namely, a measure of the degree of probability, belief, or support that an unknown parameter value lies in a specific interval. Following Savage (1962), the probability that a parameter lies in a specific interval may be referred to as a measure of final precision. While a measure of final precision may seem desirable, and while confidence levels are often (wrongly) interpreted as providing such a measure, no such interpretation is warranted. Admittedly, such a misinterpretation is encouraged by the word 'confidence'.\"</blockquote>\n* A 95% confidence level does not mean that 95% of the sample data lie within the confidence interval.\n* A confidence interval is not a definitive range of plausible values for the sample parameter, though it may be understood as an estimate of plausible values for the population parameter.\n* A particular confidence level of 95% calculated from an experiment does not mean that there is a 95% probability of a sample parameter from a repeat of the experiment falling within this interval.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== History ===\nConfidence intervals were introduced to statistics by [[Jerzy Neyman]] in a paper published in 1937.<ref name=\"Neyman2\" /> However, it took quite a while for confidence intervals to be accurately and routinely used. In the earliest modern controlled clinical trial of a medical treatment for acute stroke, published by Dyken and White in 1959, the investigators concluded that cortisol increased the risk of stroke. When confidence interval was applied however, it showed that the no possible advantage to using cortisol statement was not strictly true. There was a 12% chance that cortisol reduced risk. Especially in the medical sciences, where datasets can be small, proper selection of confidence intervals is necessary to determine size of effect, direction, and reliably determine whether the null hypothesis can be accepted or rejected.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Sandercock|first=Peter A.G.|date=May 2015|title=Short History of Confidence Intervals|url=|journal=American Heart Association|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref>\n\nIt wasn't until the 1980s that journals required confidence intervals and p-values to be reported in papers. By 1992, imprecise estimates were still common, even for large trials. This prevented a clear decision regarding the null hypothesis. For example, a study of medical therapies for acute stroke came to the conclusion that the stroke treatments could reduce mortality or increase it by 10%\u201320%. Strict admittance to the study introduced unforeseen error, further increasing uncertainty in the conclusion. Studies persisted, and it wasn't until 1997 that a trial with a massive sample pool and acceptable confidence interval was able to provide a definitive answer: cortisol therapy does not reduce the risk of acute stroke.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Philosophical issues ===\n\nThe principle behind confidence intervals was formulated to provide an answer to the question raised in [[statistical inference]] of how to deal with the uncertainty inherent in results derived from data that are themselves only a randomly selected subset of a population. There are other answers, notably that provided by [[Bayesian inference]] in the form of [[credible intervals]]. Confidence intervals correspond to a chosen rule for determining the confidence bounds, where this rule is essentially determined before any data are obtained, or before an experiment is done. The rule is defined such that over all possible datasets that might be obtained, there is a high probability (\"high\" is specifically quantified) that the interval determined by the rule will include the true value of the quantity under consideration. The Bayesian approach appears to offer intervals that can, subject to acceptance of an interpretation of \"probability\" as [[Bayesian probability]], be interpreted as meaning that the specific interval calculated from a given dataset has a particular probability of including the true value, conditional on the data and other information available. The confidence interval approach does not allow this since in this formulation and at this same stage, both the bounds of the interval and the true values are fixed values, and there is no randomness involved. On the other hand, the Bayesian approach is only as valid as the prior probability used in the computation, whereas the confidence interval does not depend on assumptions about the prior probability.\n\nThe questions concerning how an interval expressing uncertainty in an estimate might be formulated, and of how such intervals might be interpreted, are not strictly mathematical problems and are philosophically problematic.<ref>T. Seidenfeld, ''Philosophical Problems of Statistical Inference: Learning from R.A. Fisher'', Springer-Verlag, 1979</ref> Mathematics can take over once the basic principles of an approach to 'inference' have been established, but it has only a limited role in saying why one approach should be preferred to another: For example, a confidence level of 95% is often used in the [[biological sciences]], but this is a matter of convention or arbitration. In the [[physical sciences]], a much higher level may be used.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.graphpad.com/www/data-analysis-resource-center/blog/statistical-significance-defined-using-the-five-sigma-standard/\n|title=Statistical significance defined using the five sigma standard}}</ref>\n\n=== Relationship with other statistical topics ===\n\n==== Statistical hypothesis testing ====\n{{See also|Statistical hypothesis testing#Alternatives|Estimation statistics}}\n\nConfidence intervals are closely related to statistical [[statistical hypothesis testing|significance testing]].

While not all confidence intervals are constructed in this way, one general purpose approach to constructing confidence intervals is to define a 100(1&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;''\u03b1'')% confidence interval to consist of all those values ''\u03b8''<sub>0</sub> for which a test of the hypothesis ''\u03b8''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''\u03b8''<sub>0</sub> is not rejected at a significance level of 100\u03b1%. Such an approach may not always be available since it presupposes the practical availability of an appropriate significance test. Naturally, any assumptions required for the significance test would carry over to the confidence intervals.\n\nIt may be convenient to make the general correspondence that parameter values within a confidence interval are equivalent to those values that would not be rejected by a hypothesis test, but this would be dangerous. In many instances the confidence intervals that are quoted are only approximately valid, perhaps derived from \"plus or minus twice the standard error,\" and the implications of this for the supposedly corresponding hypothesis tests are usually unknown.\n\nIt is worth noting that the confidence interval for a parameter is not the same as the acceptance region of a test for this parameter, as is sometimes thought. The confidence interval is part of the parameter space, whereas the acceptance region is part of the sample space. For the same reason, the confidence level is not the same as the complementary probability of the level of significance.{{elucidate|date=November 2013}}\n\n==== Confidence region ====\n{{Main|Confidence region}}\n[[Confidence region]]s generalize the confidence interval concept to deal with multiple quantities. Such regions can indicate not only the extent of likely [[sampling error]]s but can also reveal whether (for example) it is the case that if the estimate for one quantity is unreliable, then the other is also likely to be unreliable.\n\n==== Confidence band ====\n{{Main|Confidence band}}\n\nA [[confidence band]] is used in [[statistics|statistical analysis]] to represent the uncertainty in an estimate of a curve or function based on limited or noisy data. Similarly, a '''prediction band''' is used to represent the uncertainty about the value of a new data point on the curve, but subject to noise. Confidence and prediction bands are often used as part of the graphical presentation of results of a [[regression analysis]].\n\nConfidence bands are closely related to confidence intervals, which represent the uncertainty in an estimate of a single numerical value. \"As confidence intervals, by construction, only refer to a single point, they are narrower (at this point) than a confidence band which is supposed to hold simultaneously at many points.\"<ref>p.65 in W.

A ''confidence interval'' for the parameter ''\u03b8'', with confidence level or confidence coefficient ''\u03b3'', is an interval with random endpoints (''u''(''X''),&nbsp;''v''(''X'')), determined by the pair of [[random variable]]s ''u''(''X'') and ''v''(''X''), with the property:\n: <math>{\\Pr}_{\\theta,\\varphi}(u(X)<\\theta<v(X))=\\gamma\\text{ for all }(\\theta,\\varphi).</math>\n\nThe quantities ''\u03c6'' in which there is no immediate interest are called [[nuisance parameter]]s, as statistical theory still needs to find some way to deal with them.\nThe number ''\u03b3'', with typical values close to but not greater than 1, is sometimes given in the form 1&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;''\u03b1'' (or as a percentage 100%\u00b7(1&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;''\u03b1'')), where ''\u03b1'' is a small non-negative number, close to 0.\n\nHere Pr<sub>''\u03b8'',''\u03c6''</sub> indicates the probability distribution of ''X'' characterised by&nbsp;(''\u03b8'',&nbsp;''\u03c6''). An important part of this specification is that the random interval (''u''(''X''),&nbsp;''v''(''X'')) covers the unknown value ''\u03b8'' with a high probability no matter what the true value of ''\u03b8'' actually is.\n\nNote that here Pr<sub>''\u03b8'',''\u03c6''</sub> need not refer to an explicitly given parameterized family of distributions, although it often does. Just as the random variable ''X'' notionally corresponds to other possible realizations of ''x'' from the same population or from the same version of reality, the parameters (''\u03b8'',&nbsp;''\u03c6'') indicate that we need to consider other versions of reality in which the distribution of ''X'' might have different characteristics.\n\nIn a specific situation, when ''x'' is the outcome of the sample ''X'', the interval (''u''(''x''),&nbsp;''v''(''x'')) is also referred to as a confidence interval for ''\u03b8''. Note that it is no longer possible to say that the (observed) interval (''u''(''x''),&nbsp;''v''(''x'')) has probability ''\u03b3'' to contain the parameter ''\u03b8''. This observed interval is just one realization of all possible intervals for which the probability statement holds.\n\n==== Approximate confidence intervals ====\n\nIn many applications, confidence intervals that have exactly the required confidence level are hard to construct. But practically useful intervals can still be found: the rule for constructing the interval may be accepted as providing a confidence interval at level ''\u03b3'' if\n\n: <math> {\\Pr}_{\\theta,\\varphi}(u(X)<\\theta<v(X))\\approx\\gamma\\text{ for all }(\\theta,\\varphi)\\,</math>\n\nto an acceptable level of approximation. Alternatively, some authors<ref>George G. Roussas (1997) A Course in Mathematical Statistics, 2nd Edition, Academic Press, p397</ref> simply require that\n\n: <math>{\\Pr}_{\\theta,\\varphi}(u(X)<\\theta<v(X))\\ge\\gamma\\text{ for all }(\\theta,\\varphi)\\,</math>\n\nwhich is useful if the probabilities are only partially identified, or [[Imprecise probability|imprecise]].\n\n=== Desirable properties ===\n\nWhen applying standard statistical procedures, there will often be standard ways of constructing confidence intervals. These will have been devised so as to meet certain desirable properties, which will hold given that the assumptions on which the procedure rely are true. These desirable properties may be described as: validity, optimality, and invariance. Of these \"validity\" is most important, followed closely by \"optimality\". \"Invariance\" may be considered as a property of the method of derivation of a confidence interval rather than of the rule for constructing the interval. In non-standard applications, the same desirable properties would be sought.\n* ''Validity.'' This means that the nominal [[coverage probability]] (confidence level) of the confidence interval should hold, either exactly or to a good approximation.\n* ''Optimality.'' This means that the rule for constructing the confidence interval should make as much use of the information in the data-set as possible. Recall that one could throw away half of a dataset and still be able to derive a valid confidence interval. One way of assessing optimality is by the length of the interval so that a rule for constructing a confidence interval is judged better than another if it leads to intervals whose lengths are typically shorter.\n* ''Invariance.'' In many applications, the quantity being estimated might not be tightly defined as such. For example, a survey might result in an estimate of the median income in a population, but it might equally be considered as providing an estimate of the logarithm of the median income, given that this is a common scale for presenting graphical results. It would be desirable that the method used for constructing a confidence interval for the median income would give equivalent results when applied to constructing a confidence interval for the logarithm of the median income: specifically the values at the ends of the latter interval would be the logarithms of the values at the ends of former interval.\n\n=== Methods of derivation ===\n\nFor non-standard applications, there are several routes that might be taken to derive a rule for the construction of confidence intervals. Established rules for standard procedures might be justified or explained via several of these routes. Typically a rule for constructing confidence intervals is closely tied to a particular way of finding a [[point estimation|point estimate]] of the quantity being considered.\n\n; [[Summary statistics]]\n: This is closely related to the [[method of moments (statistics)|method of moments]] for estimation. A simple example arises where the quantity to be estimated is the mean, in which case a natural estimate is the sample mean. The usual arguments indicate that the sample variance can be used to estimate the variance of the sample mean. A confidence interval for the true mean can be constructed centered on the sample mean with a width which is a multiple of the square root of the sample variance.\n; Likelihood theory\n: Where estimates are constructed using the [[maximum likelihood principle]], the theory for this provides two ways of constructing confidence intervals or confidence regions for the estimates.{{Clarify|date=July 2014}}<!-- Allowing inference from internal document. Please expand. --> One way is by using [[Likelihood-ratio test#Distribution: Wilks's theorem|Wilks's theorem]] to find all the possible values of <math>\\theta</math> that fulfill the following restriction:<ref>Abramovich, Felix, and Ya'acov Ritov.

There are corresponding generalizations of the results of maximum likelihood theory that allow confidence intervals to be constructed based on estimates derived from [[estimating equations]].{{Clarify|date=July 2014}}<!-- Allowing inference from internal document. Please expand. -->\n; [[Hypothesis testing]]\n: If significance tests are available for general values of a parameter, then confidence intervals/regions can be constructed by including in the 100''p''% confidence region all those points for which the significance test of the null hypothesis that the true value is the given value is not rejected at a significance level of (1&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;''p'').<ref name=CH7 />\n; [[Bootstrapping (statistics)|Bootstrapping]]\n: In situations where the distributional assumptions for that above methods are uncertain or violated, resampling methods allow construction of confidence intervals or prediction intervals. The observed data distribution and the internal correlations are used as the surrogate for the correlations in the wider population.\n\n== Examples ==\n\n=== Practical example ===\n[[File:Margarinefilling.png|right]]A machine fills cups with a liquid, and is supposed to be adjusted so that the content of the cups is 250&nbsp;g of liquid. As the machine cannot fill every cup with exactly 250.0&nbsp;g, the content added to individual cups shows some variation, and is considered a random variable X. This variation is assumed to be [[normal distribution|normally distributed]] around the desired average of 250&nbsp;g, with a [[standard deviation]], [[Sigma|\u03c3]], of 2.5&nbsp;g. To determine if the machine is adequately calibrated, a sample of ''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;25 cups of liquid is chosen at random and the cups are weighed. The resulting measured masses of liquid are ''X''<sub>1</sub>,&nbsp;...,&nbsp;''X''<sub>25</sub>, a random sample from&nbsp;''X''.\n\nTo get an impression of the expectation ''\u03bc'', it is sufficient to give an estimate. The appropriate [[estimator]] is the sample mean:\n\n: <math>\\hat \\mu=\\bar X = \\frac 1 n \\sum_{i=1}^n X_i.</math>\n\nThe sample shows actual weights ''x''<sub>1</sub>,&nbsp;...,&nbsp;''x''<sub>25</sub>, with mean:\n\n: <math>\\bar x=\\frac {1}{25} \\sum_{i=1}^{25} x_i = 250.2 \\text{ grams}.</math>\n\nIf we take another sample of 25 cups, we could easily expect to find mean values like 250.4 or 251.1&nbsp;grams. A sample mean value of 280&nbsp;grams however would be extremely rare if the mean content of the cups is in fact close to 250&nbsp;grams. There is a whole interval around the observed value 250.2&nbsp;grams of the sample mean within which, if the whole population mean actually takes a value in this range, the observed data would not be considered particularly unusual. Such an interval is called a confidence interval for the parameter&nbsp;''\u03bc''. How do we calculate such an interval? The endpoints of the interval have to be calculated from the sample, so they are statistics, functions of the sample ''X''<sub>1</sub>,&nbsp;...,&nbsp;''X''<sub>25</sub> and hence random variables themselves.\n\nIn our case we may determine the endpoints by considering that the sample mean {{overbar|''X''}} from a normally distributed sample is also normally distributed, with the same expectation ''\u03bc'', but with a [[Standard error (statistics)|standard error]] of:\n\n: <math>\\frac \\sigma {\\sqrt{n}}=\\frac {2.5 \\text{ g}}{\\sqrt{25}}=0.5 \\text{ grams}</math>\n\nBy [[Standard score|standardizing]], we get a random variable:\n\n: <math>Z = \\frac {\\bar X-\\mu}{\\sigma/\\sqrt{n}} =\\frac {\\bar X-\\mu}{0.5} </math>\n\ndependent on the parameter ''\u03bc'' to be estimated, but with a standard normal distribution independent of the parameter&nbsp;''\u03bc''. Hence it is possible to find numbers \u2212''z'' and ''z'', independent of&nbsp;''\u03bc'', between which ''Z'' lies with probability 1&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;\u03b1, a measure of how confident we want to be.\n\nWe take 1&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;\u03b1 = 0.95, for example. So we have:\n\n:<math>P(-z\\le Z\\le z) = 1-\\alpha = 0.95.</math>\n\nThe number ''z'' follows from the [[cumulative distribution function]], in this case the [[Normal distribution#Cumulative distribution function|cumulative normal distribution function]]:\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\Phi(z) & = P(Z \\le z) = 1 - \\tfrac{\\alpha}{2} = 0.975,\\\\[6pt]\nz & = \\Phi^{-1}(\\Phi(z)) = \\Phi^{-1}(0.975) = 1.96,\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nand we get:\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n0.95 & = 1-\\alpha=P(-z \\le Z \\le z)=P \\left(-1.96 \\le \\frac {\\bar X-\\mu}{\\sigma/\\sqrt{n}} \\le 1.96 \\right) \\\\[6pt]\n& = P \\left( \\bar X - 1.96 \\frac \\sigma {\\sqrt{n}} \\le \\mu \\le \\bar X + 1.96 \\frac \\sigma {\\sqrt{n}}\\right).\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nIn other words, the lower endpoint of the 95% confidence interval is:\n:<math>\\text{Lower endpoint} = \\bar X - 1.96 \\frac \\sigma {\\sqrt{n}},</math>\nand the upper endpoint of the 95% confidence interval is:\n:<math>\\text{Upper endpoint} = \\bar X + 1.96 \\frac \\sigma {\\sqrt{n}}.</math>\n\nWith the values in this example, the confidence interval is:\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n0.95 & = \\Pr(\\bar X - 1.96 \\times 0.5 \\le \\mu \\le \\bar X + 1.96 \\times 0.5) \\\\[6pt]\n& = \\Pr( \\bar X - 0.98 \\le \\mu \\le \\bar X + 0.98).\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nAs the standard deviation of the population [[Sigma|\u03c3]] is known in this case, the distribution of the sample mean <math>\\bar X</math> is a [[normal distribution]] with <math>\\mu</math> the only unknown parameter. In the theoretical example below, the parameter \u03c3 is also unknown, which calls for using the [[Student's t-distribution]].\n\n==== Interpretation{{anchor|Practical example interpretation}} ====\nThis might be interpreted as: with probability 0.95 we will find a confidence interval in which the value of parameter ''\u03bc'' will be between the stochastic endpoints\n\n:<math>\\! \\bar X - 0{.}98</math>\n\nand\n\n:<math>\\! \\bar X + 0.98.</math>\n\nThis does not mean there is 0.95 probability that the value of parameter ''\u03bc'' is in the interval obtained by using the currently computed value of the sample mean,\n\n: <math> (\\bar{x}-0.98,\\, \\bar{x}+0.98). </math>\n\nInstead, every time the measurements are repeated, there will be another value for the mean&nbsp;{{overbar|''X''}} of the sample. In 95% of the cases ''\u03bc'' will be between the endpoints calculated from this mean, but in 5% of the cases it will not be. The actual confidence interval is calculated by entering the measured masses in the formula. Our 0.95 confidence interval becomes:\n\n: <math>(\\bar x - 0.98;\\bar x + 0.98) = (250.2 - 0.98; 250.2 + 0.98) = (249.22; 251.18).\\,</math>\n\n[[File:NYW-confidence-interval.svg|thumb|300px|The blue vertical [[line segment]]s represent 50 realizations of a confidence interval for the population mean ''\u03bc'', represented as a red horizontal dashed line; note that some confidence intervals do not contain the population mean, as expected.]]\n\nIn other words, the 95% confidence interval is between the lower endpoint 249.22 g and the upper endpoint&nbsp;251.18&nbsp;g.\n\nAs the desired value 250 of ''\u03bc'' is within the resulted confidence interval, there is no reason to believe the machine is wrongly calibrated.\n\nThe calculated interval has fixed endpoints, where \u03bc might be in between (or not). Thus this event has probability either 0 or&nbsp;1. One '''cannot''' say: \"with probability (1&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;''\u03b1'') the parameter ''\u03bc'' lies in the confidence interval.\" One only knows that by repetition in 100(1&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;''\u03b1'')% of the cases, ''\u03bc'' will be in the calculated interval. In 100\u03b1% of the cases however it does not. And unfortunately one does not know in which of the cases this happens. That is (instead of using the term \"probability\") why one can say: \"with '''confidence level''' 100(1&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;\u03b1) %, ''\u03bc''&nbsp;lies in the confidence interval.\"\n\nThe maximum error is calculated to be 0.98 since it is the difference between the value that we are confident of with upper or lower endpoint.\n\nThe figure on the right shows 50 realizations of a confidence interval for a given population mean ''\u03bc''. If we randomly choose one realization, the probability is 95% we end up having chosen an interval that contains the parameter; however, we may be unlucky and have picked the wrong one. We will never know; we are stuck with our interval.\n\n=== Practical example extension: importance of confidence intervals in medical research ===\nMedical research often estimates the effects of an intervention or exposure in a certain population.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite journal|last=Attia|first=Abdelhamid|date= December 2005|title=Evidence-based Medicine Corner- Why should researchers report the confidence interval in modern research?|url=http://www.bioline.org.br/abstract?id=mf05015|journal=Middle East Fertility Society Journal|volume=10|pages=|via=}}</ref> Usually, researchers have determined the significance of the effects based on the p-value; however, recently there has been a push for more statistical information in order to provide a stronger basis for the estimations.<ref name=\":4\" /> One way to resolve this issue is also requiring the reporting of the confidence interval.

For other approaches to expressing uncertainty using intervals, see [[interval estimation]].\n\n=== Comparison to prediction intervals ===\n{{Main|Prediction interval}}\n\nA [[prediction interval]] for a [[random variable]] is defined similarly to a confidence interval for a [[statistical parameter]]. Consider an additional [[random variable]] ''Y'' which may or may not be statistically dependent on the [[random sample]] ''X''. Then (''u''(''X''),&nbsp;''v''(''X'')) provides a [[prediction interval]] for the as-yet-to-be observed value ''y'' of ''Y'' if\n\n: <math>{\\Pr}_{\\theta,\\varphi}(u(X) < Y < v(X)) = \\gamma\\text{ for all }(\\theta,\\varphi).\\,</math>\n\nHere Pr<sub>''\u03b8'',''\u03c6''</sub> indicates the [[joint probability distribution]] of the random variables (''X'',&nbsp;''Y''), where this distribution depends on the [[statistical parameter]]s&nbsp;(''\u03b8'',&nbsp;''\u03c6'').\n\n=== Comparison to tolerance intervals ===\n{{Main|Tolerance interval}}\n{{expand section|date=September 2014}}\n\n=== Comparison to Bayesian interval estimates{{anchor|Credible interval}} ===\n{{See also|Credible interval#Confidence interval}}\n\nA Bayesian interval estimate is called a [[credible interval]]. Using much of the same notation as above, the definition of a credible interval for the unknown true value of ''\u03b8'' is, for a given ''\u03b3'',<ref>{{cite book |author=Bernardo JE, Smith, Adrian |title=Bayesian theory |publisher=Wiley |location=New York |year=2000 |pages=259 |isbn=978-0-471-49464-5 |oclc= |doi= }}</ref>\n\n: <math>\\Pr(u(x)<\\Theta<v(x) \\mid X = x)=\\gamma. \\, </math>\n\nHere \u0398 is used to emphasize that the unknown value of ''\u03b8'' is being treated as a random variable. The definitions of the two types of intervals may be compared as follows.\n* The definition of a confidence interval involves probabilities calculated from the distribution of ''X'' for a given (''\u03b8'',&nbsp;''\u03c6'') (or conditional on these values) and the condition needs to hold for all values of&nbsp;(''\u03b8'',&nbsp;''\u03c6'').\n* The definition of a credible interval involves probabilities calculated from the distribution of \u0398 conditional on the observed values of ''X''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''x'' and marginalised (or averaged) over the values of \u03a6, where this last quantity is the random variable corresponding to the uncertainty about the [[nuisance parameter]]s in&nbsp;''\u03c6''.\n\nNote that the treatment of the nuisance parameters above is often omitted from discussions comparing confidence and credible intervals but it is markedly different between the two cases.\n\nIn some simple standard cases, the intervals produced as confidence and credible intervals from the same data set can be identical. They are very different if informative [[prior information]] is included in the [[Bayesian analysis]], and may be very different for some parts of the space of possible data even if the Bayesian prior is relatively [[uninformative prior|uninformative]].\n\nThere is disagreement about which of these methods produces the most useful results: the mathematics of the computations are rarely in question\u2013confidence intervals being based on sampling distributions, credible intervals being based on [[Bayes' theorem]]\u2013but the application of these methods, the utility and interpretation of the produced statistics, is debated.\n\n=== Confidence intervals for proportions and related quantities ===\n\n{{See also|Margin of error|Binomial proportion confidence interval}}\n\nAn approximate confidence interval for a population mean can be constructed for random variables that are not normally distributed in the population, relying on the [[central limit theorem]], if the [[sample size]]s and counts are big enough. The formulae are identical to the case above (where the sample mean is actually normally distributed about the population mean). The approximation will be quite good with only a few dozen observations in the sample if the [[probability distribution]] of the random variable is not too different from the [[normal distribution]] (e.g. its [[cumulative distribution function]] does not have any [[Discontinuity (mathematics)|discontinuities]] and its [[skewness]] is moderate).\n\nOne type of sample mean is the mean of an [[indicator variable]], which takes on the value 1 for true and the value 0 for false. The mean of such a variable is equal to the proportion that has the variable equal to one (both in the population and in any sample). This is a useful property of indicator variables, especially for hypothesis testing. To apply the central limit theorem, one must use a large enough sample. A rough rule of thumb is that one should see at least 5 cases in which the indicator is 1 and at least 5 in which it is 0. Confidence intervals constructed using the above formulae may include negative numbers or numbers greater than 1, but proportions obviously cannot be negative or exceed 1. Additionally, sample proportions can only take on a finite number of values, so the central limit theorem and the normal distribution are not the best tools for building a confidence interval. See \"[[Binomial proportion confidence interval]]\" for better methods which are specific to this case.\n\n=== Counter-examples{{anchor|Counter-examples}} ===\n\nSince confidence interval theory was proposed, a number of counter-examples to the theory have been developed to show how the interpretation of confidence intervals can be problematic, at least if one interprets them na\u00efvely.\n\n==== Confidence procedure for uniform location ====\n\nWelch<ref>{{cite journal |last= Welch|first=B.

Welch showed that the first confidence procedure dominates the second, according to desiderata from confidence interval theory; for every <math>\\theta_1\\neq\\theta</math>, the probability that the first procedure contains <math>\\theta_1</math> is ''less than or equal to'' the probability that the second procedure contains <math>\\theta_1</math>. The average width of the intervals from the first procedure is less than that of the second. Hence, the first procedure is preferred under classical confidence interval theory.\n\nHowever, when <math> |X_1-X_2| \\geq 1/2</math>, intervals from the first procedure are ''guaranteed'' to contain the true value <math>\\theta</math>: Therefore, the nominal 50% confidence coefficient is unrelated to the uncertainty we should have that a specific interval contains the true value. The second procedure does not have this property.\n\nMoreover, when the first procedure generates a very short interval, this indicates that <math>X_1,X_2</math> are very close together and hence only offer the information in a single data point. Yet the first interval will exclude almost all reasonable values of the parameter due to its short width. The second procedure does not have this property.\n\nThe two counter-intuitive properties of the first procedure\u2014100% coverage when <math>X_1,X_2</math> are far apart and almost 0% coverage when <math>X_1,X_2</math> are close together\u2014balance out to yield 50% coverage on average. However, despite the first procedure being optimal, its intervals offer neither an assessment of the precision of the estimate nor an assessment of the uncertainty one should have that the interval contains the true value.\n\nThis counter-example is used to argue against na\u00efve interpretations of confidence intervals. If a confidence procedure is asserted to have properties beyond that of the nominal coverage (such as relation to precision, or a relationship with Bayesian inference), those properties must be proved; they do not follow from the fact that a procedure is a confidence procedure.\n\n==== Confidence procedure for ''\u03c9''<sup>2</sup> ====\n\nSteiger<ref>{{cite journal |last= Steiger|first=J.

Morey et al.<ref name=Morey /> point out that several of these confidence procedures, including the one for ''\u03c9''<sup>2</sup>, have the property that as the ''F'' statistic becomes increasingly small\u2014indicating misfit with all possible values of ''\u03c9''<sup>2</sup>\u2014the confidence interval shrinks and can even contain only the single value ''\u03c9''<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;0; that is, the CI is infinitesimally narrow (this occurs when <math>p\\geq1-\\alpha/2</math> for a <math>100(1-\\alpha)\\%</math> CI).\n\nThis behavior is consistent with the relationship between the confidence procedure and significance testing: as ''F'' becomes so small that the group means are much closer together than we would expect by chance, a significance test might indicate rejection for most or all values of ''\u03c9''<sup>2</sup>. Hence the interval will be very narrow or even empty (or, by a convention suggested by Steiger, containing only 0). However, this does ''not'' indicate that the estimate of ''\u03c9''<sup>2</sup> is very precise. In a sense, it indicates the opposite: that the trustworthiness of the results themselves may be in doubt. This is contrary to the common interpretation of confidence intervals that they reveal the precision of the estimate.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[CDF-based nonparametric confidence interval|Cumulative distribution function-based nonparametric confidence interval]]\n* [[CLs upper limits (particle physics)]]\n* [[Confidence distribution]]\n* [[Credence (statistics)]]\n* [[Error bar]]\n* [[Estimation statistics]]\n* [[p-value]]\n* [[Robust confidence intervals]]\n* [[Confidence region]]\n* [[Credible interval]]\n\n=== Confidence interval for specific distributions ===\n* [[Binomial proportion confidence interval|Confidence interval for binomial distribution]]\n* [[Power law#Estimating the exponent from empirical data|Confidence interval for exponent of the power law distribution]]\n* [[Exponential distribution#Confidence intervals|Confidence interval for mean of the exponential distribution]]\n* [[Poisson distribution#Confidence interval|Confidence interval for mean of the Poisson distribution]]\n* [[Normal distribution#Estimation of parameters|Confidence intervals for mean and variance of the normal distribution]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em|refs=\n\n<ref name=CH>Cox D.R., Hinkley D.V.

This proposes a range of plausible values for an unknown [[parameter]] (for example, the mean). The interval has an associated '''confidence level''' that the true parameter is in the proposed range. Given observations <math>x_1, \\ldots, x_n</math> and a confidence level <math>\\gamma</math>, a valid confidence interval has a <math>\\gamma</math> probability of containing the true underlying parameter. The level of confidence can be chosen by the investigator. In general terms, a confidence interval for an unknown parameter is based on sampling the [[Probability distribution|distribution]] of a corresponding [[estimator]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=A modern introduction to probability and statistics : understanding why and how|last=Dekking, F.M.

In other words, if confidence intervals are constructed using a given confidence level from an infinite number of independent sample statistics, the proportion of those intervals that contain the true value of the parameter will be equal to the confidence level.<ref name=\"CH\" /><ref name=\"KS\" /><ref name=\"Neyman\" /> For example, if the confidence level (CL) is 90% then in hypothetical indefinite data collection, in 90% of the samples the interval estimate will contain the population parameter.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|title=Introductory statistics|last=Illowsky, Barbara|others=Dean, Susan L., 1945-, Illowsky, Barbara., OpenStax College|isbn=978-1-947172-05-0|location=Houston, Texas|oclc=899241574}}</ref>\n\nThe confidence level is designated prior to examining the data.

A larger sample will tend to produce a better estimate of the population parameter, when all other factors are equal. A higher confidence level will tend to produce a broader confidence interval.\n\nMany confidence intervals are of the form: <math>(t-c\\sigma_T, t+c\\sigma_T)</math>, where <math>t</math> is the realization of the dataset, c is a constant and <math>\\sigma_T</math> is the standard deviation of the dataset.<ref name=\":0\" /> Another way to express the form of confidence interval:\n\n(point estimate \u2013 error bound, point estimate + error bound)\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0or symbolically expressed, (\u2013EBM, +EBM)\n\nwhere (point estimate) serves as an estimate for m (the population mean) and EBM is the error bound for a population mean.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nThe margin of error (EBM) depends on the confidence level.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nA thorough, general definition:\n\nSuppose a dataset <math>x_1, \\ldots, x_n</math> is given, modeled as realization of random variables <math>X_1,\\ldots,X_n</math>.

The number <math>\\gamma</math> is called the ''confidence level''.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n{{toc limit|3}}\n\n== Conceptual basis ==\n\n[[File:Confidenceinterval.png|thumb|200px|In this [[bar chart]], the top ends of the brown bars indicate observed [[mean]]s and the red [[line segment]]s (\"error bars\") represent the confidence intervals around them. Although the error bars are shown as symmetric around the means, that is not always the case. It is also important to note that in most graphs, the error bars do not represent confidence intervals (e.g., they often represent standard errors or [[standard deviations]])]]\n\n=== Introduction ===\n\n[[Interval estimation]] can be contrasted with [[point estimation]]. A point estimate is a single value given as the estimate of a population parameter that is of interest, for example, the mean of some quantity. An interval estimate specifies instead a range within which the parameter is estimated to lie. Confidence intervals are commonly reported in tables or graphs along with point estimates of the same parameters, to show the [[Reliability (statistics)|reliability]] of the estimates.\n\nFor example, a confidence interval can be used to describe how reliable survey results are. In a poll of election\u2013voting intentions, the result might be that 40% of respondents intend to vote for a certain party. A 99% <!--this number is correct, do not change!-->confidence interval for the proportion in the whole population having the same intention on the survey might be 30% to 50%. From the same data one may calculate a 90% <!--this number is correct, do not change!-->confidence interval, which in this case might be 37% to 43%. A major factor determining the length of a confidence interval is the [[Sample size|size of the sample]] used in the estimation procedure, for example, the number of people taking part in a survey.\n\n=== Meaning and interpretation ===\n{{See also|#Practical example interpretation}}\n\nVarious interpretations of a confidence interval can be given (taking the 90% confidence interval as an example in the following).\n* The confidence interval can be expressed in terms of [[Sample (statistics)|samples]] (or [[Replication (statistics)|repeated samples]]): \"''Were this procedure to be repeated on numerous samples, the fraction of calculated confidence intervals (which would differ for each sample) that encompass the true population parameter would tend toward 90%.\"''<ref name=CH />\n* The confidence interval can be expressed in terms of a single sample: \"''There is a 90% [[Coverage probability|probability]] that the calculated confidence interval from some future experiment encompasses the true value of the population parameter.\"'' Note this is a probability statement about the confidence interval, not the population parameter. This considers the probability associated with a confidence interval from a pre-experiment point of view, in the same context in which arguments for the random allocation of treatments to study items are made. Here the experimenter sets out the way in which they intend to calculate a confidence interval and to know, before they do the actual experiment, that the interval they will end up calculating has a particular chance of covering the true but unknown value.<ref name=Neyman /> This is very similar to the \"repeated sample\" interpretation above, except that it avoids relying on considering hypothetical repeats of a sampling procedure that may not be repeatable in any meaningful sense. See [[Neyman construction]].\n* The explanation of a confidence interval can amount to something like: \"''The confidence interval represents values for the population parameter for which the difference between the parameter and the observed estimate is not [[statistically significant]] at the 10% level''\".<ref>Cox D.R., Hinkley D.V. (1974) Theoretical Statistics, Chapman & Hall, pp 214, 225, 233</ref> In fact, this relates to one particular way in which a confidence interval may be constructed.\n\nIn each of the above, the following applies: If the true value of the parameter lies outside the 90% confidence interval, then a sampling event has occurred (namely, obtaining a point estimate of the parameter at least this far from the true parameter value) which had a probability of 10% (or less) of happening by chance.\n\n==== Misunderstandings ====\n{{See also|#Counter-examples|Misunderstandings of p-values}}\nConfidence intervals and levels are frequently misunderstood, and published studies have shown that even professional scientists often misinterpret them.<ref>[http://iase-web.org/documents/papers/icots8/ICOTS8_C104_KALINOWSKI.pdf]</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://irt.com.ne.kr/data/researchers%20misunderstand%20ci%20and%20error%20bars.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-09-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304043241/http://irt.com.ne.kr/data/researchers%20misunderstand%20ci%20and%20error%20bars.pdf |archive-date=2016-03-04 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>Hoekstra, R., R.

The 95% probability relates to the reliability of the estimation procedure, not to a specific calculated interval.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/eda/section3/eda352.htm|title=1.3.5.2.

In fact, I have repeatedly stated that the frequency of correct results will tend to ''\u03b1''. Consider now the case when a sample is already drawn, and the calculations have given [particular limits]. Can we say that in this particular case the probability of the true value [falling between these limits] is equal to ''\u03b1''? The answer is obviously in the negative. The parameter is an unknown constant, and no probability statement concerning its value may be made...\"</blockquote>\n:Deborah Mayo expands on this further as follows:<ref name=Mayo /><blockquote>\"It must be stressed, however, that having seen the value [of the data], Neyman\u2013Pearson theory never permits one to conclude that the specific confidence interval formed covers the true value of 0 with either (1&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;''\u03b1'')100% probability or (1&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;''\u03b1'')100% degree of confidence. Seidenfeld's remark seems rooted in a (not uncommon) desire for Neyman\u2013Pearson confidence intervals to provide something which they cannot legitimately provide; namely, a measure of the degree of probability, belief, or support that an unknown parameter value lies in a specific interval. Following Savage (1962), the probability that a parameter lies in a specific interval may be referred to as a measure of final precision. While a measure of final precision may seem desirable, and while confidence levels are often (wrongly) interpreted as providing such a measure, no such interpretation is warranted. Admittedly, such a misinterpretation is encouraged by the word 'confidence'.\"</blockquote>\n* A 95% confidence level does not mean that 95% of the sample data lie within the confidence interval.\n* A confidence interval is not a definitive range of plausible values for the sample parameter, though it may be understood as an estimate of plausible values for the population parameter.\n* A particular confidence level of 95% calculated from an experiment does not mean that there is a 95% probability of a sample parameter from a repeat of the experiment falling within this interval.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== History ===\nConfidence intervals were introduced to statistics by [[Jerzy Neyman]] in a paper published in 1937.<ref name=\"Neyman2\" /> However, it took quite a while for confidence intervals to be accurately and routinely used. In the earliest modern controlled clinical trial of a medical treatment for acute stroke, published by Dyken and White in 1959, the investigators concluded that cortisol increased the risk of stroke. When confidence interval was applied however, it showed that the no possible advantage to using cortisol statement was not strictly true. There was a 12% chance that cortisol reduced risk. Especially in the medical sciences, where datasets can be small, proper selection of confidence intervals is necessary to determine size of effect, direction, and reliably determine whether the null hypothesis can be accepted or rejected.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Sandercock|first=Peter A.G.|date=May 2015|title=Short History of Confidence Intervals|url=|journal=American Heart Association|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref>\n\nIt wasn't until the 1980s that journals required confidence intervals and p-values to be reported in papers. By 1992, imprecise estimates were still common, even for large trials. This prevented a clear decision regarding the null hypothesis. For example, a study of medical therapies for acute stroke came to the conclusion that the stroke treatments could reduce mortality or increase it by 10%\u201320%. Strict admittance to the study introduced unforeseen error, further increasing uncertainty in the conclusion. Studies persisted, and it wasn't until 1997 that a trial with a massive sample pool and acceptable confidence interval was able to provide a definitive answer: cortisol therapy does not reduce the risk of acute stroke.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Philosophical issues ===\n\nThe principle behind confidence intervals was formulated to provide an answer to the question raised in [[statistical inference]] of how to deal with the uncertainty inherent in results derived from data that are themselves only a randomly selected subset of a population. There are other answers, notably that provided by [[Bayesian inference]] in the form of [[credible intervals]]. Confidence intervals correspond to a chosen rule for determining the confidence bounds, where this rule is essentially determined before any data are obtained, or before an experiment is done. The rule is defined such that over all possible datasets that might be obtained, there is a high probability (\"high\" is specifically quantified) that the interval determined by the rule will include the true value of the quantity under consideration. The Bayesian approach appears to offer intervals that can, subject to acceptance of an interpretation of \"probability\" as [[Bayesian probability]], be interpreted as meaning that the specific interval calculated from a given dataset has a particular probability of including the true value, conditional on the data and other information available. The confidence interval approach does not allow this since in this formulation and at this same stage, both the bounds of the interval and the true values are fixed values, and there is no randomness involved. On the other hand, the Bayesian approach is only as valid as the prior probability used in the computation, whereas the confidence interval does not depend on assumptions about the prior probability.\n\nThe questions concerning how an interval expressing uncertainty in an estimate might be formulated, and of how such intervals might be interpreted, are not strictly mathematical problems and are philosophically problematic.<ref>T. Seidenfeld, ''Philosophical Problems of Statistical Inference: Learning from R.A. Fisher'', Springer-Verlag, 1979</ref> Mathematics can take over once the basic principles of an approach to 'inference' have been established, but it has only a limited role in saying why one approach should be preferred to another: For example, a confidence level of 95% is often used in the [[biological sciences]], but this is a matter of convention or arbitration. In the [[physical sciences]], a much higher level may be used.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.graphpad.com/www/data-analysis-resource-center/blog/statistical-significance-defined-using-the-five-sigma-standard/\n|title=Statistical significance defined using the five sigma standard}}</ref>\n\n=== Relationship with other statistical topics ===\n\n==== Statistical hypothesis testing ====\n{{See also|Statistical hypothesis testing#Alternatives|Estimation statistics}}\n\nConfidence intervals are closely related to statistical [[statistical hypothesis testing|significance testing]]. For example, if for some estimated parameter ''\u03b8'' one wants to test the [[null hypothesis]] that ''\u03b8''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 against the alternative that ''\u03b8''&nbsp;\u2260&nbsp;0, then this test can be performed by determining whether the confidence interval for ''\u03b8'' contains 0.\n\nMore generally, given the availability of a hypothesis testing procedure that can test the null hypothesis ''\u03b8''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''\u03b8''<sub>0</sub> against the alternative that ''\u03b8''&nbsp;\u2260&nbsp;''\u03b8''<sub>0</sub> for any value of ''\u03b8''<sub>0</sub>, then a confidence interval with confidence level&nbsp;''\u03b3''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;''\u03b1'' can be defined as containing any number ''\u03b8''<sub>0</sub> for which the corresponding null hypothesis is not rejected at significance level&nbsp;''\u03b1''.<ref name=CH7>Cox D.R., Hinkley D.V. (1974) Theoretical Statistics, Chapman & Hall, Section 7.2(iii)</ref>\n\nIf the estimates of two parameters (for example, the mean values of a variable in two independent groups) have confidence intervals that do not overlap, then the difference between the two values is more [[statistical significance|significant]] than that indicated by the individual values of ''\u03b1''.<ref>Pav Kalinowski, \"[http://www.psychologicalscience.org/index.php/publications/observer/2010/april-10/understanding-confidence-intervals-cis-and-effect-size-estimation.html Understanding Confidence Intervals (CIs) and Effect Size Estimation]\", ''Observer'' Vol.23, No.4 April 2010.</ref> So, this \"test\" is too conservative and can lead to a result that is more significant than the individual values of ''\u03b1'' would indicate.

While not all confidence intervals are constructed in this way, one general purpose approach to constructing confidence intervals is to define a 100(1&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;''\u03b1'')% confidence interval to consist of all those values ''\u03b8''<sub>0</sub> for which a test of the hypothesis ''\u03b8''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''\u03b8''<sub>0</sub> is not rejected at a significance level of 100\u03b1%. Such an approach may not always be available since it presupposes the practical availability of an appropriate significance test. Naturally, any assumptions required for the significance test would carry over to the confidence intervals.\n\nIt may be convenient to make the general correspondence that parameter values within a confidence interval are equivalent to those values that would not be rejected by a hypothesis test, but this would be dangerous. In many instances the confidence intervals that are quoted are only approximately valid, perhaps derived from \"plus or minus twice the standard error,\" and the implications of this for the supposedly corresponding hypothesis tests are usually unknown.\n\nIt is worth noting that the confidence interval for a parameter is not the same as the acceptance region of a test for this parameter, as is sometimes thought. The confidence interval is part of the parameter space, whereas the acceptance region is part of the sample space. For the same reason, the confidence level is not the same as the complementary probability of the level of significance.{{elucidate|date=November 2013}}\n\n==== Confidence region ====\n{{Main|Confidence region}}\n[[Confidence region]]s generalize the confidence interval concept to deal with multiple quantities. Such regions can indicate not only the extent of likely [[sampling error]]s but can also reveal whether (for example) it is the case that if the estimate for one quantity is unreliable, then the other is also likely to be unreliable.\n\n==== Confidence band ====\n{{Main|Confidence band}}\n\nA [[confidence band]] is used in [[statistics|statistical analysis]] to represent the uncertainty in an estimate of a curve or function based on limited or noisy data. Similarly, a '''prediction band''' is used to represent the uncertainty about the value of a new data point on the curve, but subject to noise. Confidence and prediction bands are often used as part of the graphical presentation of results of a [[regression analysis]].\n\nConfidence bands are closely related to confidence intervals, which represent the uncertainty in an estimate of a single numerical value. \"As confidence intervals, by construction, only refer to a single point, they are narrower (at this point) than a confidence band which is supposed to hold simultaneously at many points.\"<ref>p.65 in W.

A ''confidence interval'' for the parameter ''\u03b8'', with confidence level or confidence coefficient ''\u03b3'', is an interval with random endpoints (''u''(''X''),&nbsp;''v''(''X'')), determined by the pair of [[random variable]]s ''u''(''X'') and ''v''(''X''), with the property:\n: <math>{\\Pr}_{\\theta,\\varphi}(u(X)<\\theta<v(X))=\\gamma\\text{ for all }(\\theta,\\varphi).</math>\n\nThe quantities ''\u03c6'' in which there is no immediate interest are called [[nuisance parameter]]s, as statistical theory still needs to find some way to deal with them.\nThe number ''\u03b3'', with typical values close to but not greater than 1, is sometimes given in the form 1&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;''\u03b1'' (or as a percentage 100%\u00b7(1&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;''\u03b1'')), where ''\u03b1'' is a small non-negative number, close to 0.\n\nHere Pr<sub>''\u03b8'',''\u03c6''</sub> indicates the probability distribution of ''X'' characterised by&nbsp;(''\u03b8'',&nbsp;''\u03c6''). An important part of this specification is that the random interval (''u''(''X''),&nbsp;''v''(''X'')) covers the unknown value ''\u03b8'' with a high probability no matter what the true value of ''\u03b8'' actually is.\n\nNote that here Pr<sub>''\u03b8'',''\u03c6''</sub> need not refer to an explicitly given parameterized family of distributions, although it often does. Just as the random variable ''X'' notionally corresponds to other possible realizations of ''x'' from the same population or from the same version of reality, the parameters (''\u03b8'',&nbsp;''\u03c6'') indicate that we need to consider other versions of reality in which the distribution of ''X'' might have different characteristics.\n\nIn a specific situation, when ''x'' is the outcome of the sample ''X'', the interval (''u''(''x''),&nbsp;''v''(''x'')) is also referred to as a confidence interval for ''\u03b8''. Note that it is no longer possible to say that the (observed) interval (''u''(''x''),&nbsp;''v''(''x'')) has probability ''\u03b3'' to contain the parameter ''\u03b8''. This observed interval is just one realization of all possible intervals for which the probability statement holds.\n\n==== Approximate confidence intervals ====\n\nIn many applications, confidence intervals that have exactly the required confidence level are hard to construct. But practically useful intervals can still be found: the rule for constructing the interval may be accepted as providing a confidence interval at level ''\u03b3'' if\n\n: <math> {\\Pr}_{\\theta,\\varphi}(u(X)<\\theta<v(X))\\approx\\gamma\\text{ for all }(\\theta,\\varphi)\\,</math>\n\nto an acceptable level of approximation. Alternatively, some authors<ref>George G. Roussas (1997) A Course in Mathematical Statistics, 2nd Edition, Academic Press, p397</ref> simply require that\n\n: <math>{\\Pr}_{\\theta,\\varphi}(u(X)<\\theta<v(X))\\ge\\gamma\\text{ for all }(\\theta,\\varphi)\\,</math>\n\nwhich is useful if the probabilities are only partially identified, or [[Imprecise probability|imprecise]].\n\n=== Desirable properties ===\n\nWhen applying standard statistical procedures, there will often be standard ways of constructing confidence intervals. These will have been devised so as to meet certain desirable properties, which will hold given that the assumptions on which the procedure rely are true. These desirable properties may be described as: validity, optimality, and invariance. Of these \"validity\" is most important, followed closely by \"optimality\". \"Invariance\" may be considered as a property of the method of derivation of a confidence interval rather than of the rule for constructing the interval. In non-standard applications, the same desirable properties would be sought.\n* ''Validity.'' This means that the nominal [[coverage probability]] (confidence level) of the confidence interval should hold, either exactly or to a good approximation.\n* ''Optimality.'' This means that the rule for constructing the confidence interval should make as much use of the information in the data-set as possible. Recall that one could throw away half of a dataset and still be able to derive a valid confidence interval. One way of assessing optimality is by the length of the interval so that a rule for constructing a confidence interval is judged better than another if it leads to intervals whose lengths are typically shorter.\n* ''Invariance.'' In many applications, the quantity being estimated might not be tightly defined as such. For example, a survey might result in an estimate of the median income in a population, but it might equally be considered as providing an estimate of the logarithm of the median income, given that this is a common scale for presenting graphical results. It would be desirable that the method used for constructing a confidence interval for the median income would give equivalent results when applied to constructing a confidence interval for the logarithm of the median income: specifically the values at the ends of the latter interval would be the logarithms of the values at the ends of former interval.\n\n=== Methods of derivation ===\n\nFor non-standard applications, there are several routes that might be taken to derive a rule for the construction of confidence intervals. Established rules for standard procedures might be justified or explained via several of these routes. Typically a rule for constructing confidence intervals is closely tied to a particular way of finding a [[point estimation|point estimate]] of the quantity being considered.\n\n; [[Summary statistics]]\n: This is closely related to the [[method of moments (statistics)|method of moments]] for estimation. A simple example arises where the quantity to be estimated is the mean, in which case a natural estimate is the sample mean. The usual arguments indicate that the sample variance can be used to estimate the variance of the sample mean. A confidence interval for the true mean can be constructed centered on the sample mean with a width which is a multiple of the square root of the sample variance.\n; Likelihood theory\n: Where estimates are constructed using the [[maximum likelihood principle]], the theory for this provides two ways of constructing confidence intervals or confidence regions for the estimates.{{Clarify|date=July 2014}}<!-- Allowing inference from internal document. Please expand. --> One way is by using [[Likelihood-ratio test#Distribution: Wilks's theorem|Wilks's theorem]] to find all the possible values of <math>\\theta</math> that fulfill the following restriction:<ref>Abramovich, Felix, and Ya'acov Ritov. Statistical Theory: A Concise Introduction. CRC Press, 2013. Pages 121\u2013122</ref>\n:: <math>\\ln( L(\\theta))\\ge \\ln( L(\\hat{\\theta}))-\\frac 1 2 \\chi^2_{1,1-\\alpha } </math>\n; Estimating equations\n: The estimation approach here can be considered as both a generalization of the method of moments and a generalization of the maximum likelihood approach. There are corresponding generalizations of the results of maximum likelihood theory that allow confidence intervals to be constructed based on estimates derived from [[estimating equations]].{{Clarify|date=July 2014}}<!-- Allowing inference from internal document. Please expand. -->\n; [[Hypothesis testing]]\n: If significance tests are available for general values of a parameter, then confidence intervals/regions can be constructed by including in the 100''p''% confidence region all those points for which the significance test of the null hypothesis that the true value is the given value is not rejected at a significance level of (1&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;''p'').<ref name=CH7 />\n; [[Bootstrapping (statistics)|Bootstrapping]]\n: In situations where the distributional assumptions for that above methods are uncertain or violated, resampling methods allow construction of confidence intervals or prediction intervals. The observed data distribution and the internal correlations are used as the surrogate for the correlations in the wider population.\n\n== Examples ==\n\n=== Practical example ===\n[[File:Margarinefilling.png|right]]A machine fills cups with a liquid, and is supposed to be adjusted so that the content of the cups is 250&nbsp;g of liquid. As the machine cannot fill every cup with exactly 250.0&nbsp;g, the content added to individual cups shows some variation, and is considered a random variable X. This variation is assumed to be [[normal distribution|normally distributed]] around the desired average of 250&nbsp;g, with a [[standard deviation]], [[Sigma|\u03c3]], of 2.5&nbsp;g. To determine if the machine is adequately calibrated, a sample of ''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;25 cups of liquid is chosen at random and the cups are weighed. The resulting measured masses of liquid are ''X''<sub>1</sub>,&nbsp;...,&nbsp;''X''<sub>25</sub>, a random sample from&nbsp;''X''.\n\nTo get an impression of the expectation ''\u03bc'', it is sufficient to give an estimate. The appropriate [[estimator]] is the sample mean:\n\n: <math>\\hat \\mu=\\bar X = \\frac 1 n \\sum_{i=1}^n X_i.</math>\n\nThe sample shows actual weights ''x''<sub>1</sub>,&nbsp;...,&nbsp;''x''<sub>25</sub>, with mean:\n\n: <math>\\bar x=\\frac {1}{25} \\sum_{i=1}^{25} x_i = 250.2 \\text{ grams}.</math>\n\nIf we take another sample of 25 cups, we could easily expect to find mean values like 250.4 or 251.1&nbsp;grams. A sample mean value of 280&nbsp;grams however would be extremely rare if the mean content of the cups is in fact close to 250&nbsp;grams. There is a whole interval around the observed value 250.2&nbsp;grams of the sample mean within which, if the whole population mean actually takes a value in this range, the observed data would not be considered particularly unusual. Such an interval is called a confidence interval for the parameter&nbsp;''\u03bc''. How do we calculate such an interval? The endpoints of the interval have to be calculated from the sample, so they are statistics, functions of the sample ''X''<sub>1</sub>,&nbsp;...,&nbsp;''X''<sub>25</sub> and hence random variables themselves.\n\nIn our case we may determine the endpoints by considering that the sample mean {{overbar|''X''}} from a normally distributed sample is also normally distributed, with the same expectation ''\u03bc'', but with a [[Standard error (statistics)|standard error]] of:\n\n: <math>\\frac \\sigma {\\sqrt{n}}=\\frac {2.5 \\text{ g}}{\\sqrt{25}}=0.5 \\text{ grams}</math>\n\nBy [[Standard score|standardizing]], we get a random variable:\n\n: <math>Z = \\frac {\\bar X-\\mu}{\\sigma/\\sqrt{n}} =\\frac {\\bar X-\\mu}{0.5} </math>\n\ndependent on the parameter ''\u03bc'' to be estimated, but with a standard normal distribution independent of the parameter&nbsp;''\u03bc''. Hence it is possible to find numbers \u2212''z'' and ''z'', independent of&nbsp;''\u03bc'', between which ''Z'' lies with probability 1&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;\u03b1, a measure of how confident we want to be.\n\nWe take 1&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;\u03b1 = 0.95, for example. So we have:\n\n:<math>P(-z\\le Z\\le z) = 1-\\alpha = 0.95.</math>\n\nThe number ''z'' follows from the [[cumulative distribution function]], in this case the [[Normal distribution#Cumulative distribution function|cumulative normal distribution function]]:\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\Phi(z) & = P(Z \\le z) = 1 - \\tfrac{\\alpha}{2} = 0.975,\\\\[6pt]\nz & = \\Phi^{-1}(\\Phi(z)) = \\Phi^{-1}(0.975) = 1.96,\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nand we get:\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n0.95 & = 1-\\alpha=P(-z \\le Z \\le z)=P \\left(-1.96 \\le \\frac {\\bar X-\\mu}{\\sigma/\\sqrt{n}} \\le 1.96 \\right) \\\\[6pt]\n& = P \\left( \\bar X - 1.96 \\frac \\sigma {\\sqrt{n}} \\le \\mu \\le \\bar X + 1.96 \\frac \\sigma {\\sqrt{n}}\\right).\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nIn other words, the lower endpoint of the 95% confidence interval is:\n:<math>\\text{Lower endpoint} = \\bar X - 1.96 \\frac \\sigma {\\sqrt{n}},</math>\nand the upper endpoint of the 95% confidence interval is:\n:<math>\\text{Upper endpoint} = \\bar X + 1.96 \\frac \\sigma {\\sqrt{n}}.</math>\n\nWith the values in this example, the confidence interval is:\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n0.95 & = \\Pr(\\bar X - 1.96 \\times 0.5 \\le \\mu \\le \\bar X + 1.96 \\times 0.5) \\\\[6pt]\n& = \\Pr( \\bar X - 0.98 \\le \\mu \\le \\bar X + 0.98).\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nAs the standard deviation of the population [[Sigma|\u03c3]] is known in this case, the distribution of the sample mean <math>\\bar X</math> is a [[normal distribution]] with <math>\\mu</math> the only unknown parameter. In the theoretical example below, the parameter \u03c3 is also unknown, which calls for using the [[Student's t-distribution]].\n\n==== Interpretation{{anchor|Practical example interpretation}} ====\nThis might be interpreted as: with probability 0.95 we will find a confidence interval in which the value of parameter ''\u03bc'' will be between the stochastic endpoints\n\n:<math>\\! \\bar X - 0{.}98</math>\n\nand\n\n:<math>\\! \\bar X + 0.98.</math>\n\nThis does not mean there is 0.95 probability that the value of parameter ''\u03bc'' is in the interval obtained by using the currently computed value of the sample mean,\n\n: <math> (\\bar{x}-0.98,\\, \\bar{x}+0.98). </math>\n\nInstead, every time the measurements are repeated, there will be another value for the mean&nbsp;{{overbar|''X''}} of the sample. In 95% of the cases ''\u03bc'' will be between the endpoints calculated from this mean, but in 5% of the cases it will not be. The actual confidence interval is calculated by entering the measured masses in the formula. Our 0.95 confidence interval becomes:\n\n: <math>(\\bar x - 0.98;\\bar x + 0.98) = (250.2 - 0.98; 250.2 + 0.98) = (249.22; 251.18).\\,</math>\n\n[[File:NYW-confidence-interval.svg|thumb|300px|The blue vertical [[line segment]]s represent 50 realizations of a confidence interval for the population mean ''\u03bc'', represented as a red horizontal dashed line; note that some confidence intervals do not contain the population mean, as expected.]]\n\nIn other words, the 95% confidence interval is between the lower endpoint 249.22 g and the upper endpoint&nbsp;251.18&nbsp;g.\n\nAs the desired value 250 of ''\u03bc'' is within the resulted confidence interval, there is no reason to believe the machine is wrongly calibrated.\n\nThe calculated interval has fixed endpoints, where \u03bc might be in between (or not). Thus this event has probability either 0 or&nbsp;1. One '''cannot''' say: \"with probability (1&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;''\u03b1'') the parameter ''\u03bc'' lies in the confidence interval.\" One only knows that by repetition in 100(1&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;''\u03b1'')% of the cases, ''\u03bc'' will be in the calculated interval. In 100\u03b1% of the cases however it does not. And unfortunately one does not know in which of the cases this happens. That is (instead of using the term \"probability\") why one can say: \"with '''confidence level''' 100(1&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;\u03b1) %, ''\u03bc''&nbsp;lies in the confidence interval.\"\n\nThe maximum error is calculated to be 0.98 since it is the difference between the value that we are confident of with upper or lower endpoint.\n\nThe figure on the right shows 50 realizations of a confidence interval for a given population mean ''\u03bc''. If we randomly choose one realization, the probability is 95% we end up having chosen an interval that contains the parameter; however, we may be unlucky and have picked the wrong one. We will never know; we are stuck with our interval.\n\n=== Practical example extension: importance of confidence intervals in medical research ===\nMedical research often estimates the effects of an intervention or exposure in a certain population.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite journal|last=Attia|first=Abdelhamid|date= December 2005|title=Evidence-based Medicine Corner- Why should researchers report the confidence interval in modern research?|url=http://www.bioline.org.br/abstract?id=mf05015|journal=Middle East Fertility Society Journal|volume=10|pages=|via=}}</ref> Usually, researchers have determined the significance of the effects based on the p-value; however, recently there has been a push for more statistical information in order to provide a stronger basis for the estimations.<ref name=\":4\" /> One way to resolve this issue is also requiring the reporting of the confidence interval.

For other approaches to expressing uncertainty using intervals, see [[interval estimation]].\n\n=== Comparison to prediction intervals ===\n{{Main|Prediction interval}}\n\nA [[prediction interval]] for a [[random variable]] is defined similarly to a confidence interval for a [[statistical parameter]]. Consider an additional [[random variable]] ''Y'' which may or may not be statistically dependent on the [[random sample]] ''X''. Then (''u''(''X''),&nbsp;''v''(''X'')) provides a [[prediction interval]] for the as-yet-to-be observed value ''y'' of ''Y'' if\n\n: <math>{\\Pr}_{\\theta,\\varphi}(u(X) < Y < v(X)) = \\gamma\\text{ for all }(\\theta,\\varphi).\\,</math>\n\nHere Pr<sub>''\u03b8'',''\u03c6''</sub> indicates the [[joint probability distribution]] of the random variables (''X'',&nbsp;''Y''), where this distribution depends on the [[statistical parameter]]s&nbsp;(''\u03b8'',&nbsp;''\u03c6'').\n\n=== Comparison to tolerance intervals ===\n{{Main|Tolerance interval}}\n{{expand section|date=September 2014}}\n\n=== Comparison to Bayesian interval estimates{{anchor|Credible interval}} ===\n{{See also|Credible interval#Confidence interval}}\n\nA Bayesian interval estimate is called a [[credible interval]]. Using much of the same notation as above, the definition of a credible interval for the unknown true value of ''\u03b8'' is, for a given ''\u03b3'',<ref>{{cite book |author=Bernardo JE, Smith, Adrian |title=Bayesian theory |publisher=Wiley |location=New York |year=2000 |pages=259 |isbn=978-0-471-49464-5 |oclc= |doi= }}</ref>\n\n: <math>\\Pr(u(x)<\\Theta<v(x) \\mid X = x)=\\gamma. \\, </math>\n\nHere \u0398 is used to emphasize that the unknown value of ''\u03b8'' is being treated as a random variable. The definitions of the two types of intervals may be compared as follows.\n* The definition of a confidence interval involves probabilities calculated from the distribution of ''X'' for a given (''\u03b8'',&nbsp;''\u03c6'') (or conditional on these values) and the condition needs to hold for all values of&nbsp;(''\u03b8'',&nbsp;''\u03c6'').\n* The definition of a credible interval involves probabilities calculated from the distribution of \u0398 conditional on the observed values of ''X''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''x'' and marginalised (or averaged) over the values of \u03a6, where this last quantity is the random variable corresponding to the uncertainty about the [[nuisance parameter]]s in&nbsp;''\u03c6''.\n\nNote that the treatment of the nuisance parameters above is often omitted from discussions comparing confidence and credible intervals but it is markedly different between the two cases.\n\nIn some simple standard cases, the intervals produced as confidence and credible intervals from the same data set can be identical. They are very different if informative [[prior information]] is included in the [[Bayesian analysis]], and may be very different for some parts of the space of possible data even if the Bayesian prior is relatively [[uninformative prior|uninformative]].\n\nThere is disagreement about which of these methods produces the most useful results: the mathematics of the computations are rarely in question\u2013confidence intervals being based on sampling distributions, credible intervals being based on [[Bayes' theorem]]\u2013but the application of these methods, the utility and interpretation of the produced statistics, is debated.\n\n=== Confidence intervals for proportions and related quantities ===\n\n{{See also|Margin of error|Binomial proportion confidence interval}}\n\nAn approximate confidence interval for a population mean can be constructed for random variables that are not normally distributed in the population, relying on the [[central limit theorem]], if the [[sample size]]s and counts are big enough. The formulae are identical to the case above (where the sample mean is actually normally distributed about the population mean). The approximation will be quite good with only a few dozen observations in the sample if the [[probability distribution]] of the random variable is not too different from the [[normal distribution]] (e.g. its [[cumulative distribution function]] does not have any [[Discontinuity (mathematics)|discontinuities]] and its [[skewness]] is moderate).\n\nOne type of sample mean is the mean of an [[indicator variable]], which takes on the value 1 for true and the value 0 for false. The mean of such a variable is equal to the proportion that has the variable equal to one (both in the population and in any sample). This is a useful property of indicator variables, especially for hypothesis testing. To apply the central limit theorem, one must use a large enough sample. A rough rule of thumb is that one should see at least 5 cases in which the indicator is 1 and at least 5 in which it is 0. Confidence intervals constructed using the above formulae may include negative numbers or numbers greater than 1, but proportions obviously cannot be negative or exceed 1. Additionally, sample proportions can only take on a finite number of values, so the central limit theorem and the normal distribution are not the best tools for building a confidence interval. See \"[[Binomial proportion confidence interval]]\" for better methods which are specific to this case.\n\n=== Counter-examples{{anchor|Counter-examples}} ===\n\nSince confidence interval theory was proposed, a number of counter-examples to the theory have been developed to show how the interpretation of confidence intervals can be problematic, at least if one interprets them na\u00efvely.\n\n==== Confidence procedure for uniform location ====\n\nWelch<ref>{{cite journal |last= Welch|first=B. L. |date= 1939|title= On Confidence Limits and Sufficiency, with Particular Reference to Parameters of Location|jstor= 2235987 |journal= The Annals of Mathematical Statistics|volume= 10|issue= 1|pages= 58\u201369|doi= 10.1214/aoms/1177732246|doi-access= free}}</ref> presented an example which clearly shows the difference between the theory of confidence intervals and other theories of interval estimation (including Fisher's [[Fiducial inference|fiducial]] intervals and objective [[Bayesian inference|Bayesian]] intervals). Robinson<ref>{{cite journal |last= Robinson|first=G. K. |date= 1975|title= Some Counterexamples to the Theory of Confidence Intervals|jstor= 2334498 |journal= Biometrika|volume= 62|issue= 1|pages= 155\u2013161|doi=10.2307/2334498}}</ref> called this example \"[p]ossibly the best known counterexample for Neyman's version of confidence interval theory.\" To Welch, it showed the superiority of confidence interval theory; to critics of the theory, it shows a deficiency. Here we present a simplified version.\n\nSuppose that <math>X_1,X_2</math> are independent observations from a [[Uniform distribution (continuous)|Uniform]](''\u03b8'' \u2212 1/2, ''\u03b8'' + 1/2) distribution. Then the optimal 50% confidence procedure<ref>{{cite journal |last= Pratt|first=J. W. |date= 1961|title= Book Review: Testing Statistical Hypotheses. by E. L. Lehmann|jstor= 2282344 |journal= Journal of the American Statistical Association|volume= 56|issue= 293|pages= 163\u2013167|doi= 10.1080/01621459.1961.10482103}}</ref> is\n\n: <math>\\bar{X} \\pm \\begin{cases}\n\\dfrac{|X_1-X_2|}{2} & \\text{if } |X_1-X_2| < 1/2 \\\\[8pt]\n\\dfrac{1-|X_1-X_2|}{2} &\\text{if } |X_1-X_2| \\geq 1/2 .\n\\end{cases}\n</math>\n\nA fiducial or objective Bayesian argument can be used to derive the interval estimate\n: <math>\n\\bar{X} \\pm \\frac{1-|X_1-X_2|}{4},\n</math>\nwhich is also a 50% confidence procedure. Welch showed that the first confidence procedure dominates the second, according to desiderata from confidence interval theory; for every <math>\\theta_1\\neq\\theta</math>, the probability that the first procedure contains <math>\\theta_1</math> is ''less than or equal to'' the probability that the second procedure contains <math>\\theta_1</math>. The average width of the intervals from the first procedure is less than that of the second. Hence, the first procedure is preferred under classical confidence interval theory.\n\nHowever, when <math> |X_1-X_2| \\geq 1/2</math>, intervals from the first procedure are ''guaranteed'' to contain the true value <math>\\theta</math>: Therefore, the nominal 50% confidence coefficient is unrelated to the uncertainty we should have that a specific interval contains the true value. The second procedure does not have this property.\n\nMoreover, when the first procedure generates a very short interval, this indicates that <math>X_1,X_2</math> are very close together and hence only offer the information in a single data point. Yet the first interval will exclude almost all reasonable values of the parameter due to its short width. The second procedure does not have this property.\n\nThe two counter-intuitive properties of the first procedure\u2014100% coverage when <math>X_1,X_2</math> are far apart and almost 0% coverage when <math>X_1,X_2</math> are close together\u2014balance out to yield 50% coverage on average. However, despite the first procedure being optimal, its intervals offer neither an assessment of the precision of the estimate nor an assessment of the uncertainty one should have that the interval contains the true value.\n\nThis counter-example is used to argue against na\u00efve interpretations of confidence intervals. If a confidence procedure is asserted to have properties beyond that of the nominal coverage (such as relation to precision, or a relationship with Bayesian inference), those properties must be proved; they do not follow from the fact that a procedure is a confidence procedure.\n\n==== Confidence procedure for ''\u03c9''<sup>2</sup> ====\n\nSteiger<ref>{{cite journal |last= Steiger|first=J. H. |date= 2004|title= Beyond the F test: Effect size confidence intervals and tests of close fit in the analysis of variance and contrast analysis|url= http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/met/9/2/164/ |journal= Psychological Methods|volume= 9|issue= 2|pages= 164\u2013182|doi= 10.1037/1082-989x.9.2.164|pmid=15137887 |access-date= }}</ref> suggested a number of confidence procedures for common [[Effect size#Omega-squared (\u03c92)|effect size]] measures in [[Analysis of variance|ANOVA]]. Morey et al.<ref name=Morey /> point out that several of these confidence procedures, including the one for ''\u03c9''<sup>2</sup>, have the property that as the ''F'' statistic becomes increasingly small\u2014indicating misfit with all possible values of ''\u03c9''<sup>2</sup>\u2014the confidence interval shrinks and can even contain only the single value ''\u03c9''<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;0; that is, the CI is infinitesimally narrow (this occurs when <math>p\\geq1-\\alpha/2</math> for a <math>100(1-\\alpha)\\%</math> CI).\n\nThis behavior is consistent with the relationship between the confidence procedure and significance testing: as ''F'' becomes so small that the group means are much closer together than we would expect by chance, a significance test might indicate rejection for most or all values of ''\u03c9''<sup>2</sup>. Hence the interval will be very narrow or even empty (or, by a convention suggested by Steiger, containing only 0). However, this does ''not'' indicate that the estimate of ''\u03c9''<sup>2</sup> is very precise. In a sense, it indicates the opposite: that the trustworthiness of the results themselves may be in doubt. This is contrary to the common interpretation of confidence intervals that they reveal the precision of the estimate.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[CDF-based nonparametric confidence interval|Cumulative distribution function-based nonparametric confidence interval]]\n* [[CLs upper limits (particle physics)]]\n* [[Confidence distribution]]\n* [[Credence (statistics)]]\n* [[Error bar]]\n* [[Estimation statistics]]\n* [[p-value]]\n* [[Robust confidence intervals]]\n* [[Confidence region]]\n* [[Credible interval]]\n\n=== Confidence interval for specific distributions ===\n* [[Binomial proportion confidence interval|Confidence interval for binomial distribution]]\n* [[Power law#Estimating the exponent from empirical data|Confidence interval for exponent of the power law distribution]]\n* [[Exponential distribution#Confidence intervals|Confidence interval for mean of the exponential distribution]]\n* [[Poisson distribution#Confidence interval|Confidence interval for mean of the Poisson distribution]]\n* [[Normal distribution#Estimation of parameters|Confidence intervals for mean and variance of the normal distribution]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em|refs=\n\n<ref name=CH>Cox D.R., Hinkley D.V.
