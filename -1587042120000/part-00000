Sergei is shown to the division's futuristic vacuum-sealed lab inside a [[Faraday cage]] by Forest, who is elusive when Sergei asks questions about his role there and simply tells him that what he should do will become clear. The code Sergei sees shocks him, and he later surreptitiously records the code using his wristwatch. When Sergei leaves that night, Forest confronts him about stealing the code and has Kenton, the head of Amaya security, kill him as he attempts to run. Sergei's girlfriend Lily, who works in Amaya's encryption division, worries that he has not come home and reports his disappearance to Kenton and Forest. They show Lily footage appearing to show Sergei walking out of the building and off the company grounds. Unconvinced, Lily downloads a backup of Sergei's phone from [[Cloud storage|the cloud]] and discovers a suspicious password-protected program disguised as [[Sudoku]], a game Sergei disliked. She contacts her ex-boyfriend Jamie to help her crack the password. Jamie, upset over Lily's total disregard of him after their breakup, refuses to help.

Lily convinces Jamie to crack the program on Sergei's phone and finds it is a [[Russian government]] messaging app that Sergei, a suspected industrial spy, was using to contact his handler. Kenton meets Forest at home and advises him to let go of the past. Forest assures him he is, but later uses an interface in the Devs lab, on which the team has achieved a projection of the Crucifixion 2000 years in the past, to view a projection of his daughter. Lily uses the app to arrange a meeting with Sergei's handler, Anton, who tells her Sergei was sent to infiltrate Devs and that he suspects Sergei's death was murder. He offers to bring her onboard in Sergei's place. Kenton watches their meeting. Jamie tries to convince Lily not to contact anyone through the Russian app, not knowing she already has, and offers his support. Lily decides to refuse to cooperate with Anton. Kenton follows Anton into a parking garage and tells him he will kill Lily if she starts working for Russia.

Katie admonishes the Devs team for using the projection system for their own amusement, with Stewart scorning her hypocracy. Lily shares her suspicions with co-workers that Sergei was murdered, and they advise her to tell Kenton. Jen mentions that Lily has struggled with [[schizophrenia]] in the past, which Kenton reports back to Forest. Lily seems to suffer a breakdown while in a meeting with Kenton and climbs out onto a high-up window ledge, in front of Forest and the senator. When Kenton goes out after her, Jen copies data from his computer onto a flash drive \u2014 Lily, with Jen's help, had feigned schizophrenia to get the security camera footage from the night of Sergei's death.

Lily and Jamie argue over whether to contact the police. Kenton waits for Lily outside her apartment, where Pete, the homeless man who lives there, treats him with suspicion and offers Lily his support. Kenton pressures Lily into seeing a psychiatrist, with whom she discusses her past drug use and her distant relationship with her mother, who remarried and moved to [[Hong Kong]] after Lily's father died. Lyndon develops a new algorithm based on the [[many-worlds interpretation]], rather than the [[Deterministic system|deterministic]] [[De Broglie\u2013Bohm theory]] favored by Forest, that enables clear sound to be heard on the Devs projections, but Forest rejects his work and fires him. In the car, Kenton lies to Lily that the doctor said she was psychotic and a suicide risk. When Lily realizes Kenton is driving her somewhere unknown, she grabs the wheel and crashes the car, allowing her to escape when the impact knocks Kenton unconscious. Katie applies Lyndon's algorithm to light waves, resulting in clear color images, and calls up a projection of Forest's daughter Amaya, causing him to weep. Lily runs to Jamie's apartment, where she calls the police to report Sergei's death as a murder. The police arrive, accompanied by the psychiatrist and Kenton, arrest Lily for causing the crash, and take her away for [[Involuntary commitment|psychiatric commitment]], while Kenton brutally forces Jamie back inside his apartment.\n |LineColor       = 515C47\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 5\n |Title           = Episode 5\n |DirectedBy      = Alex Garland\n |WrittenBy       = Alex Garland\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|3|26}}\n |ShortSummary    = Katie views projections of events from various points in time in the Devs lab, including Kenton torturing Jamie, Lily at age ten playing [[Go (game)|Go]] with her father and talking to him on his deathbed, Sergei and Lily's first meeting and first admission of love for each other, Forest recruiting Katie at a lecture on the superposition of quantum particles after she argues with the professor for disregarding the many-worlds interpretation, the Devs team working on an early projection trial, Forest witnessing the car accident that killed his wife and daughter (superimposed with one reality in which they arrive home safely), Katie talking to Forest about his reasons for starting Devs, Kenton telling Forest and Katie that he will give them up to the authorities rather than go to jail himself, Lily falling to her death inside the Devs lab, and finally, Jamie telling his family to go into hiding before sneaking a heavily sedated Lily out of the psychiatric ward, which Katie watches with a smile.\n |LineColor       = 515C47\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 6\n |Title           = Episode 6\n |DirectedBy      = Alex Garland\n |WrittenBy       = Alex Garland\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|2}}\n |ShortSummary    = Lyndon breaks into Stewart's [[Motorhome|RV]] and asks him to help him get his Devs job back, as he is unwilling to abandon his work on the project.

They find him there with Katie, who Forest says can answer Lily's questions. Katie confirms that she and Forest are lovers and that Sergei was killed by Kenton, and explains the nature of the Devs system - a powerful computer that can show the actions of any subject in the past or future. However, the future projections cease at a certain point in time, beyond which there is only impenetrable static, due to a supposed breakdown of the laws of physics themselves. Katie tells Lily that this event is now only 21 hours away, and she believes Lily, who has been seen entering the Devs lab in the future, is the cause. Katie's deterministic view angers Lily, and she leaves with Jamie; Kenton, who had been watching them since they arrived, follows them.

He adheres to this vision, but falls and dies in the present world. Lily and Jamie resume their relationship, and she tells him she plans on proving the Devs team is delusional by not showing up when the machine predicts she will. However, Kenton enters her apartment, shoots Jamie with a silenced pistol, and attempts to strangle Lily, but is killed by Pete, saving Lily's life. Pete reveals himself as a Russian agent who had been supervising Sergei. He presents Lily with a choice: go to the CIA, or leave for Hong Kong and never return to the US.

Forest tells her that all their actions have been predetermined, and that the system's real name is [[God|Deus]]. Lily leads Forest into the capsule at gunpoint as in the projection, but as the doors close, she throws the gun away, shocking Forest. Before they can reach the entrance, Stewart overrides the [[Electromagnetic suspension|electromagnetic field]] that suspends the capsule and causes it to crash. Forest and Lily die, and Stewart tells the devastated Katie that the system had to be stopped before walking away. Lily regains consciousness on the day before Sergei joined Devs, and finds an empty field where the Devs building once stood and Forest playing with his wife and daughter there. He tells her that Katie reconstructed them from the moment of their deaths and that they now exist in one of the many worlds inside the Devs machine, where the two of them are the only ones who remember what happened. In the real world, Katie reveals the Devs system to Senator Laine, and asks her to help keep it turned on.

Lily and Jamie argue over whether to contact the police. Kenton waits for Lily outside her apartment, where Pete, the homeless man who lives there, treats him with suspicion and offers Lily his support. Kenton pressures Lily into seeing a psychiatrist, with whom she discusses her past drug use and her distant relationship with her mother, who remarried and moved to [[Hong Kong]] after Lily's father died. Lyndon develops a new algorithm based on the [[many-worlds interpretation]], rather than the [[Deterministic system|deterministic]] [[De Broglie\u2013Bohm theory]] favored by Forest, that enables clear sound to be heard on the Devs projections, but Forest rejects his work and fires him. In the car, Kenton lies to Lily that the doctor said she was psychotic and a suicide risk. When Lily realizes Kenton is driving her somewhere unknown, she grabs the wheel and crashes the car, allowing her to escape when the impact knocks Kenton unconscious. Katie applies Lyndon's algorithm to light waves, resulting in clear color images, and calls up a projection of Forest's daughter Amaya, causing him to weep. Lily runs to Jamie's apartment, where she calls the police to report Sergei's death as a murder. The police arrive, accompanied by the psychiatrist and Kenton, arrest Lily for causing the crash, and take her away for [[Involuntary commitment|psychiatric commitment]], while Kenton brutally forces Jamie back inside his apartment.\n |LineColor       = 515C47\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 5\n |Title           = Episode 5\n |DirectedBy      = Alex Garland\n |WrittenBy       = Alex Garland\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|3|26}}\n |ShortSummary    = Katie views projections of events from various points in time in the Devs lab, including Kenton torturing Jamie, Lily at age ten playing [[Go (game)|Go]] with her father and talking to him on his deathbed, Sergei and Lily's first meeting and first admission of love for each other, Forest recruiting Katie at a lecture on the superposition of quantum particles after she argues with the professor for disregarding the many-worlds interpretation, the Devs team working on an early projection trial, Forest witnessing the car accident that killed his wife and daughter (superimposed with one reality in which they arrive home safely), Katie talking to Forest about his reasons for starting Devs, Kenton telling Forest and Katie that he will give them up to the authorities rather than go to jail himself, Lily falling to her death inside the Devs lab, and finally, Jamie telling his family to go into hiding before sneaking a heavily sedated Lily out of the psychiatric ward, which Katie watches with a smile.\n |LineColor       = 515C47\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 6\n |Title           = Episode 6\n |DirectedBy      = Alex Garland\n |WrittenBy       = Alex Garland\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|2}}\n |ShortSummary    = Lyndon breaks into Stewart's [[Motorhome|RV]] and asks him to help him get his Devs job back, as he is unwilling to abandon his work on the project.

They find him there with Katie, who Forest says can answer Lily's questions. Katie confirms that she and Forest are lovers and that Sergei was killed by Kenton, and explains the nature of the Devs system - a powerful computer that can show the actions of any subject in the past or future. However, the future projections cease at a certain point in time, beyond which there is only impenetrable static, due to a supposed breakdown of the laws of physics themselves. Katie tells Lily that this event is now only 21 hours away, and she believes Lily, who has been seen entering the Devs lab in the future, is the cause. Katie's deterministic view angers Lily, and she leaves with Jamie; Kenton, who had been watching them since they arrived, follows them.

He adheres to this vision, but falls and dies in the present world. Lily and Jamie resume their relationship, and she tells him she plans on proving the Devs team is delusional by not showing up when the machine predicts she will. However, Kenton enters her apartment, shoots Jamie with a silenced pistol, and attempts to strangle Lily, but is killed by Pete, saving Lily's life. Pete reveals himself as a Russian agent who had been supervising Sergei. He presents Lily with a choice: go to the CIA, or leave for Hong Kong and never return to the US.

Forest tells her that all their actions have been predetermined, and that the system's real name is [[God|Deus]]. Lily leads Forest into the capsule at gunpoint as in the projection, but as the doors close, she throws the gun away, shocking Forest. Before they can reach the entrance, Stewart overrides the [[Electromagnetic suspension|electromagnetic field]] that suspends the capsule and causes it to crash. Forest and Lily die, and Stewart tells the devastated Katie that the system had to be stopped before walking away. Lily regains consciousness on the day before Sergei joined Devs, and finds an empty field where the Devs building once stood and Forest playing with his wife and daughter there. He tells her that Katie reconstructed them from the moment of their deaths and that they now exist in one of the many worlds inside the Devs machine, where the two of them are the only ones who remember what happened. In the real world, Katie reveals the Devs system to Senator Laine, and asks her to help keep it turned on.

Knin rose to prominence twice in history, as the capital of both the [[Kingdom of Croatia (Medieval)|medieval Kingdom of Croatia]] and, briefly, of the self-proclaimed [[Republic of Serbian Krajina]] [[Croatian War of Independence|from 1991 to 1995]].\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name is likely derived from the [[Illyria]]n ''Ninia''.<ref name=\"knin.hr\">http://www.knin.hr/povijest/</ref> According to an alternative explanation, offered by [[Franz Miklosich]] and [[Petar Skok]], the name - derived from a Slavic root ''*t\u044cn-'' (\"to cut\", \"to chop\") - has a meaning of \"cleared forest\".{{sfn|\u0160imunovi\u0107|2013|p=167}} The medieval names of Knin include {{lang-hu|Tinin}}; {{lang-it|Tenin}}; {{lang-la|Tinum}}.

The first church, a monastery dedicated to Saint Bartholomew, was built during the time of [[Trpimir I]] in the 9th century in Kapitul (south-east from Knin Castle, where the later bishopric was located).<ref>https://hrcak.srce.hr/file/140670</ref><ref>http://www.enciklopedija.hr/natuknica.aspx?id=62489</ref> It was later expanded or rebuilt by a certain Duke of Croatia, probably Svetoslav, during the reign of king [[Stephen Dr\u017eislav of Croatia]] in the 10th century.<ref>Nikola Jak\u0161i\u0107, [https://www.academia.edu/22968166/Knin-_hrvatska_srednjovjekovna_prijestolnica_Split_1995 Knin- hrvatska srednjovjekovna prijestolnica, Split 1995] pp. 7</ref>\n\nKnin is first mentioned in the 10th-century work ''[[De Administrando Imperio]]'' as the centre of the Knin county ([[\u017eupanija]]), and as one of the populated towns in [[Kingdom of Croatia (925\u20131102)|Croatia]]. Around 1040, at the behest of the Croatian kings, a seat of the royal bishop was established in the nearby royal village of Biskupija (Kosovo), in the church of Saint Mary. The first \"bishop of the Croats\" is named ''Marko Giudice'', and he and his successors were attached to the royal court as preachers and king's \"special bishops\" until 1102.<ref>''[[Illyricum sacrum]]'', IV (Venice, 1775)</ref>{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|p=23}}\n\nIn the second half of the 11th century, Knin became a more permanent royal residence of king [[Demetrius Zvonimir of Croatia|Demetrius Zvonimir]] around 1080. Because of this, it has led to Knin being known as the \"City of Croatian Kings\" or \"Zvonimir's City\" (''Zvonimirov grad'') in recent times.<ref name=\"Info Adriatic\">{{cite web|url=http://www.infoadriatic.com/hrvatska/knin/index.shtml|title=Knin apartmani, hoteli, privatni smjetaj > Hrvatska > Jadran > Dalmacija|publisher=|accessdate=26 December 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080805102252/http://www.infoadriatic.com/hrvatska/knin/index.shtml|archive-date=5 August 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref> In the following decade, during the succession crisis, the city was the permanent residence of a local lord [[Petar Sva\u010di\u0107]], who contested the crown of Croatia until his defeat by king [[Coloman of Hungary]] in 1096. At that point, it came into possession of the Hungarian [[Arpad dynasty]], and since then, it ceased to be a permanent royal residence but remained as a political and administrative center of the kingdom.

Due to the extinction of the local ruling dynasty, the Croatian bishop moved his see to Knin itself, after which he started calling himself the Bishop of Knin.{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|p=28}} This precipitated the construction of a new cathedral, which was initiated in 1203 by the son of the Duke of Knin, Dobroslav in Kapitul.\n\nThe city was visited by Queen [[Maria Laskarina]], the daughter of the [[Byzantine Emperor]] and wife of king Bela IV, together with her retinue of nobles and a great number of soldiers in 1261 in order to introduce her son to the Croatian nobility and to negotiate their oath in recognizing him as the designated duke (herceg).{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|p=32}} In 1264, the first case of judicial function in the city was mentioned and during this time, Knin was the seat of both the Croatian ban, and the duke, who acted as a semi-independent ruler with close connection to the king and whose chancellor had been the bishop of Knin.{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|p=33}} Between 1270 and 1272, the new cathedral was consecrated on the orders of the Knin bishop Nicholas.{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1949}}<ref>Nikola Jak\u0161i\u0107, [https://www.academia.edu/22968166/Knin-_hrvatska_srednjovjekovna_prijestolnica_Split_1995 Knin- hrvatska srednjovjekovna prijestolnica, Split 1995] pp. 19</ref> The cathedral is described as being \"magnificent\" and \"solemn\" by subsequent documents.

According to the 19th century Franciscan friar and historian [[Donato Fabianich]], the monastery of [[St. Catharines|Saint Catherine]] was founded around this time by the Knin dignitaries and nobility which were first settled there by Mladen \u0160ubi\u0107.<ref>Donato Fabianich, Storia dei fratri minori dai primordi della joro istituzione in Dal\u00b7 mazia e Bossina, fino ai giorni nostri, I, Zadar 1863, pp. 94.</ref> Their rule over Knin came to an end at the [[Battle of Bliska]] in 1322, after which the Angevin king [[Charles I of Hungary|Charles Robert]] arrived in the city and imprisoned the former lord [[Mladen II \u0160ubi\u0107 of Bribir]].{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|p=35}} Upon the departure of the king to Hungary, the noble [[Ivan Nelipi\u0107]] quickly seized Knin, and from there expelled the king's men from Croatia. Thus, these territories ''de facto'' continued to remain outside the monarchy, and the [[Nelipi\u0107 noble family]] made Knin their permanent seat and ruled their territories as \"Princes of Knin\".\n\nAfter successfully warring against their enemies, the Dalmatian cities and nobility under [[George II \u0160ubi\u0107 of Bribir|Juraj II \u0160ubi\u0107 of Bribir]] (who was imprisoned in the castle's dungeons), as well as the royal forces commanded by the [[Ban of Slavonia|Slavonian ban]] ''Mikac Prodani\u0107'',<ref>Miha Madijev, cap. XXIII.{{full citation needed|date=December 2016}}</ref> their rule came to an end when [[Louis I of Hungary]] personally led an army to re-establish royal power over Knin in 1345. During this time it became known that the castle consisted of two major parts, administered by two castellans and which was populated by houses and baths, a palace with a main hall used previously by the Nelipi\u0107's to sign an alliance with the [[Republic of Venice]] and to enforce customs on imports to the city. An annual trade fair, on Saint Bartholomew's day is known to have taken place in the settlement below since at least the 1360s and was regularly attended by the merchants from the Dalmatian cities.<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=rbWZAgg9a5EC&pg=PA246&lpg=PA246&dq=mladen+an%C4%8Di%C4%87+knin+u+razvijenom+i+kasnom+srednjem+vijeku#v=onepage&q=mladen%20an%C4%8Di%C4%87%20knin%20u%20razvijenom%20i%20kasnom%20srednjem%20vijeku&f=false |title = The Man of Many Devices, who Wandered Full Many Ways--: Festschrift in Honour of J\u00a0nos M.

There the noble Ivan Nelipi\u0107 (son of Vladislava) had reaffirmed his rights to the estates and lands in [[Cetina]] during his stay in the city.{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|pp=52\u201353}}{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|pp=55\u201356}}\n[[File:StefatonKnin.png|thumb|right|250px|Stone slab of Knin Fortress depicting [[Stephaton]] thought to have originated from the Church of St. Stephen in the Knin's burg, 11th century]]\nUsing the dynastic instability in the neighboring lands, the city came into the hands of the Bosnian king [[Tvrtko I of Bosnia|Tvrtko I]] during the year of 1388. The previous bishop had likely been expelled, where the [[Republic of Ragusa|Ragusan]] Mihailo took his place, and was also given the office of the king's chancellor. These actions provoked a retaliation of king [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund]], whose armies besieged Knin in September 1390. The city, along with other territories were returned to Sigismund in 1393. Upon his return from the disastrous [[battle of Nicopolis]] in 1396, the king spent a month in Knin to consolidate his holdings and state affairs of Dalmatia and Croatia, issuing various decrees together with his ban [[Nicholas II Garai|Nikola Gorjanski]].{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|p=60}} In 1401, the city was besieged by the Bosnian king [[Stephen Ostoja]], who encamped in the adjacent Knin field (Kninsko polje), and remained there until the following year. The newly crowned king [[Ladislaus of Naples]] attained support from the castellan of Knin and issued his first decree there in 1403.\n\nBecause of frequent harassment, the citizens of Knin had to pay tribute to the duke [[Hrvoje Vuk\u010di\u0107 Hrvatini\u0107]], and for a short while, the city seemed to have been directly under his rule. The presence of [[Franciscans]] is for the first time mentioned in the 15th century, which were located in the old Saint Mary's church and monastery in the city. Apart from them, other religious buildings are mentioned such as the church of the [[Holy Spirit]].<ref name=\"academia.edu\"/>\n\nIts strategic position played an important role in many wars and power changes \u2013 the Republic of Venice often reflected on its importance as a key castle and the main entrance to Dalmatia, which it attempted to obtain during the 15th century.{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|p=64}} During these years both the city, the ban and his dignitaries played a crucial role in the struggle for dominance over the coastal cities with Venice. In 1430 Knin and the Church of St. Bartolomeo in Kapitul were the centre of the \"Union and Brotherhood of the Croats\" ({{lang-la|unio et fraternitas Croatorum}}), a congregation of [[Croatian nobility|Croatian nobles]] formed by 12 [[counties of Croatia]] in order to \"preserve the fame and old customs of the Croatian Kingdom\".<ref>Mladen An\u010di\u0107: \"Desetlje\u0107e od 1091. do 1102. u zrcalu vrela\" (Summary: The decade between 1091 and 1102 according to the sources), Povijesni prilozi 17/1998, p. 253</ref><ref>Damir Karbi\u0107: Hrvatski plemi\u0107ki rod i obi\u010dajno pravo, p. 109-111</ref>\n\nIt was in 1420 that the Nelipi\u0107 noble family again regained their former role in Croatia with the emergence of [[Ivani\u0161 Nelipi\u0107]], which again distanced these territories from the crown. These possessions were later acquired after Ivani\u0161's death in 1435 by [[Ivan Frankopan|An\u017e]] of the [[House of Frankopan]] through the marriage with the Nelipi\u0107 nobles. Knin and the surrounding possessions were restored to the crown upon An\u017e's death in 1437.{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|p=68}} In 1454 an attempt between the Bosnian king and the Venetians was made to acquire the city, which was referenced as \"capital and foremost place of Croatia\" in their letters.{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|p=72}}\n\nDuring the reign of king [[Matthias Corvinus]], the bishops of Knin were selected as the king's principal orators abroad in collecting the help needed against the invading [[Ottoman Empire]]. The bishop was thus first secretly involved at the [[pope]] to solicit financial aid for Matthias' military campaign. The city's distant surroundings quickly became a target for Ottoman raids. As the raids were becoming more frequent, one of them reached Knin, where a Franciscan monastery has been recorded to have been destroyed in 1469.\n\nIn 1493, the first direct attempt of siege by the Ottomans was undertaken, which was followed by ban [[John Corvinus]] and his deputies invading and pillaging the Ottoman territories from the city. The Republic of Venice started to financially support the city's defences in fear for its possessions in Dalmatia. In 1501, three Ottoman spies were caught and imprisoned by the vice-ban. They were sent by the [[Sanjak of Bosnia|Sanjak-bey of Bosnia]], and had infiltrated Knin posing as friars that were on their way to sell [[vestment]]s to the market. They were to investigate the situation in the Zadar surrounding.{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|p=82}}\n\n[[File:KninPagano1525.png|thumb|right|280px|Knin castle, settlement and Kapitul around 1525, after Ottoman conquest from the map of Dalmatia from [[Matteo Pagano]]]]\nThe last major conflict around Knin before the truce was in September 1502 when 2,000 Ottoman cavalrymen looted the area.{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|p=84}} On 20 August 1503 King [[Vladislaus II of Hungary|Vladislaus II]] concluded a 7-year peace treaty with Sultan [[Bayezid II]]. The armistice was generally respected by all sides,<ref>[[Ive Ma\u017euran]]: Povijest Hrvatske od 15. stolje\u0107a do 18. stolje\u0107a, p. 44-45</ref> during which Knin's defensive positions were strengthened in 1504. A period of severe famine started in 1505 that affected entire Dalmatia. In 1510 the plague halved Knin's population.\n\nIn 1510 around 1,000 Ottoman [[Ak\u0131nc\u0131]] raided the countryside of Knin. There had been word that viceban of Croatia was captured on that occasion. Baltazar Ba\u0107an ({{lang-hu|Boldizs\u00e1r Batthy\u00e1ny}}), viceban of Slavonia, together with forces from the Zagreb Bishopry, managed to lift the siege of Knin in January 1513. Next year in February the Ottomans laid siege on Knin with 10,000 men from the Sanjak of Bosnia, but were unable to take the city and lost 500 troops. Knin's burg and outskirts were burned on this occasion.<ref>Vjekoslav Klai\u0107: Povijest Hrvata od najstarijih vremena do svr\u0161etka XIX. stolje\u0107a, Knjiga \u010detvrta, Zagreb, 1988, p. 302</ref>{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|p=88}} These clashes left Knin devastated and there was no news about the city for five years. Local population was decimated by war, hunger, plague and migration to safer places, and its economy was hindered by the seizure of crops and livestock. Due to Knin's strategic value, King [[Louis II of Hungary|Louis II]] responded to requests from captains of Knin, Skradin and Ostrovica and promised reinforcements of 1,000 infantry and 1,000 cavalrymen. However, it is unlikely that these forces arrived to the endangered towns.\n\nOn May 29, 1522, [[Siege of Knin|after the final siege]] of the Knin castle, it fell to the [[Ottoman Empire]],{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|p=89}} and Croats left the town in large numbers.

After Venice captured the district in 1688, the Bishop of [[\u0160ibenik]] was appointed to administer the diocese, which was united in 1828 to \u0160ibenik.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14736b.htm|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: See of Tinin (Dalmatia)|publisher=|accessdate=26 December 2014}}</ref> The bishopric is today the [[titular see]] of [[Diocese of Tinum|Tinum]].<ref>''Annuario Pontificio 2013'' (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 2013 {{ISBN|978-88-209-9070-1}}), p. 991</ref>\n\nA century and a half later, on September 11, 1688, it was captured by the [[Venetian Republic]]. Subsequently, the Croatian population partially returned and the [[Franciscans]] built a monastery and a church there in 1708. Ottomans aimed to retake Knin during [[Ottoman\u2013Venetian War (1714\u201318)|Ottoman-Venetian War]], but their siege was repulsed in 1715.\n\n===Habsburg era===\n[[File: Knin1866-1868 2.jpg |thumb|Knin in 1866-1898]]\n{{Expand section|date=June 2016}}\nKnin passed on to the [[Habsburg]]s together with [[Dalmatia]] in 1797 according to the [[Treaty of Campo Formio]]. After the [[Peace of Pressburg (1805)|Peace of Pressburg]] in 1805, the French Empire gained the city and incorporated it into the [[Illyrian Provinces]] in 1809. By 1813, the Austrians regained control over the town. By the end of the 19th century, as a part of the [[Habsburg]] domain of Dalmatia, Knin grew steadily, becoming an important commercial as well as road and railway center. In 1867, Knin became a part of [[Dalmatia]] \u2013 a territorial entity within [[Cisleithania]]. After the [[First World War]] Knin became a part of the [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]] in 1918, which subsequently became part of the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] ([[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] after 1929).\n\n===Modern===\n====World War II====\nIn [[World War II in Yugoslavia|World War II]], Knin was in the so-called [[Independent State of Croatia#Zones of influence|second Italian occupation zone]], administered by civilian authorities of collaborationist [[Independent State of Croatia]] led by fascist Ustasa regime, but with heavy [[Fascist Italy (1922\u20131943)|Italian]] military presence. Italians also relied heavily on local ethnic Serb militias ([[Chetniks]]) to maintain order and surpress [[Yugoslav Partisans|partisan resistance]]. Chetniks and Ustasa officers collaborated as antifascist resistance intensified. Ustasa regime declared Knin [[Counties of the Independent State of Croatia|county seat]]. After [[Italian surrender]] in September 1943, German forces became the main factor in the region. As the war progressed and partisan forces liberated most of Dalmatia, with Germans pulling out and retreating northwards, Axis and partisan forces became pitted on Knin in a [[Battle of Knin|major battle]] in early December 1944. The [[8th Dalmatian Corps]] sought to destroy [[Nazi Germany|German]], [[Usta\u0161e]] and [[Chetniks|Chetnik]] formations in North [[Dalmatia]] and the city of Knin. With around 50 thousand troops involved and more than 7 thousand casulties on both sides, it was a decisive partisan victory. Knin was liberated on December 9th.\n\n====Socialist Yugoslavia====\n{{Expand section|date=April 2020}}\nBetween 1945 and 1990, Knin saw rapid industrialization and modernization, becoming a centre of a wider region.

Although the city is only some 50&nbsp;km (31&nbsp;mi) from the Adriatic Sea, an arm of the Mediterranean, the proximity of the Dinaric Alps to the north alters its climate. Knin is particularly known for its hot summers: temperatures reaching 40&nbsp;\u00b0C (104&nbsp;\u00b0F) are not uncommon in July and August. The January average temperature is about 4&nbsp;\u00b0C and in August is about 24&nbsp;\u00b0C\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Knin (1971\u20132000, extremes 1949\u20132017)\n|width = auto\n|metric first = Y\n|single line = Y\n|Jan record high C = 20.5\n|Feb record high C = 22.3\n|Mar record high C = 27.6\n|Apr record high C = 29.2\n|May record high C = 34.2\n|Jun record high C = 39.3\n|Jul record high C = 40.9\n|Aug record high C = 42.3\n|Sep record high C = 37.4\n|Oct record high C = 31.6\n|Nov record high C = 27.6\n|Dec record high C = 21.6\n|year record high C = 42.3\n| Jan high C = 8.9\n| Feb high C = 10.4\n| Mar high C = 14.1\n| Apr high C = 17.4\n| May high C = 23.0\n| Jun high C = 26.6\n| Jul high C = 30.1\n| Aug high C = 30.3\n| Sep high C = 25.4\n| Oct high C = 19.9\n| Nov high C = 13.7\n| Dec high C = 9.9\n|year high C = 19.1\n|Jan mean C = 4.0\n|Feb mean C = 5.1\n|Mar mean C = 8.2\n|Apr mean C = 11.5\n|May mean C = 16.6\n|Jun mean C = 20.1\n|Jul mean C = 23.0\n|Aug mean C = 22.5\n|Sep mean C = 18.0\n|Oct mean C = 13.3\n|Nov mean C = 8.2\n|Dec mean C = 5.0\n|year mean C = 13.0\n| Jan low C = -0.2\n| Feb low C = 0.7\n| Mar low C = 3.3\n| Apr low C = 6.5\n| May low C = 10.6\n| Jun low C = 13.8\n| Jul low C = 16.2\n| Aug low C = 16.0\n| Sep low C = 12.2\n| Oct low C = 8.3\n| Nov low C = 3.8\n| Dec low C = 0.9\n|year low C = 7.7\n|Jan record low C = -18.3\n|Feb record low C = -18.4\n|Mar record low C = -14.0\n|Apr record low C = -4.1\n|May record low C = -0.4\n|Jun record low C = 4.3\n|Jul record low C = 8.1\n|Aug record low C = 6.8\n|Sep record low C = 1.0\n|Oct record low C = -3.3\n|Nov record low C = -8.5\n|Dec record low C = -15.4\n|year record low C = -18.4\n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation mm = 75.9\n|Feb precipitation mm = 69.8\n|Mar precipitation mm = 74.7\n|Apr precipitation mm = 92.0\n|May precipitation mm = 90.5\n|Jun precipitation mm = 81.1\n|Jul precipitation mm = 43.7\n|Aug precipitation mm = 61.7\n|Sep precipitation mm = 108.1\n|Oct precipitation mm = 114.3\n|Nov precipitation mm = 112.3\n|Dec precipitation mm = 101.7\n|year precipitation mm = 1025.8\n|unit precipitation days = 0.1 mm\n| Jan precipitation days = 10.7\n| Feb precipitation days = 9.2\n| Mar precipitation days = 9.6\n| Apr precipitation days = 11.8\n| May precipitation days = 11.4\n| Jun precipitation days = 10.8\n| Jul precipitation days = 6.4\n| Aug precipitation days = 7.1\n| Sep precipitation days = 8.8\n| Oct precipitation days = 10.5\n| Nov precipitation days = 11.0\n| Dec precipitation days = 11.0\n|year precipitation days = 118.4\n|unit snow days = 1.0 cm\n|Jan snow days = 1.3\n|Feb snow days = 1.2\n|Mar snow days = 0.2\n|Apr snow days = 0.0\n|May snow days = 0.0\n|Jun snow days = 0.0\n|Jul snow days = 0.0\n|Aug snow days = 0.0\n|Sep snow days = 0.0\n|Oct snow days = 0.0\n|Nov snow days = 0.3\n|Dec snow days = 0.5\n|year snow days = 3.5\n|Jan humidity = 69.0\n|Feb humidity = 63.5\n|Mar humidity = 62.2\n|Apr humidity = 63.1\n|May humidity = 63.6\n|Jun humidity = 62.1\n|Jul humidity = 56.1\n|Aug humidity = 58.3\n|Sep humidity = 65.8\n|Oct humidity = 69.2\n|Nov humidity = 70.1\n|Dec humidity = 70.3\n|year humidity = 64.4\n|Jan sun = 120.9\n|Feb sun = 146.9\n|Mar sun = 182.9\n|Apr sun = 189.0\n|May sun = 244.9\n|Jun sun = 270.0\n|Jul sun = 325.5\n|Aug sun = 297.6\n|Sep sun = 234.0\n|Oct sun = 182.9\n|Nov sun = 123.0\n|Dec sun = 108.5\n|year sun =\n| source 1 = [[Croatian Meteorological and Hydrological Service]]<ref name= DHMZ >{{cite web\n| url = http://klima.hr/k1/k1_2/knin.pdf\n| title = Knin Climate Normals\n| accessdate = 3 December 2015\n| publisher = Croatian Meteorological and Hydrological Service}}</ref><ref name=monthlyvalues>{{cite web\n| url = http://klima.hr/klima.php?id=k1&param=srednjak&Grad=knin\n| title = Mjese\u010dne vrijednosti za Knin u razdoblju 1949\u22122014\n| language = Croatian\n| accessdate = 3 December 2015\n| publisher = Croatian Meteorological and Hydrological Service}}</ref>\n|date=August 2014}}\n\n==Demographics==\n[[File:Knin population.png|thumb|Knin population 1857-2018]]\n[[File:Knin i Dinara.jpg|thumb|right|View of Knin and the [[Dinara]] mountain]]\n[[File:Kninska crkva u izgradnji.JPG|thumb|Our Lady of the Great Croatian Baptismal Vow church]]\n[[File:Arhitektura Bizanta u Kninu.JPG|thumb|Serbian Orthodox church in Knin]]\n\n[[Croatian Bureau of Statistics]] estimated the population of Knin municipality on December 31, 2018 to stand at 11,590.<ref>[https://www.dzs.hr/Hrv_Eng/Pokazatelji/Gradovi%20u%20statistici.xlsx Gradovi u statistici], Croatian Bureau of Statistics, published on 31/10/2019</ref> This represents a steep decline: just seven years earlier, in the [[2011 Census of Croatia|2011 census]], Knin municipality had a population of 15,388, while Knin (town) had a population of 10,493.<ref name=\"census2011\"/> In the 2001 census, the population of Knin was 15,190 (whole municipality) with 11,128 in town proper.

NK Dinara's colours were black and white until 2005 when the club changed its colours to red, white and blue. NK Dinara plays in the 4th division in Croatia ([[1. \u017dupanijska liga \u0160ibensko-kninska]]). The logo of NK Dinara is red, white, and blue (in that order) with the letter \"D\" in the middle of the logo.\n\nKnin has a sports association which was formed in 1998. [[Basketball]] is also popular in Knin. The Croatian National basketball team has played a match in Knin. They played against [[Israel]] in 1999 where Croatia won the match 78:68. Other sports played in Knin are [[Rugby football|rugby]], [[team handball|handball]], [[volleyball]], [[kickboxing]], [[karate]], [[tennis]]  and [[taekwondo]].\n\n==Transport==\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2015}}\n[[File:Station Knin.JPG|thumb|right|Knin railway station building]]\nThe most important intercity roadway in Knin is the Croatian [[D1 (Croatia)|state route D1]]. The route makes for easy access of Knin from the major coastal city of [[Split (city)|Split]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}} The section of D1 from Knin to [[A1 (Croatia)|A1]] highway will be upgraded to the expressway level in following years (with [[B1 (Croatia)|B1]] expressway).\n\nKnin is also an important railway junction as the railroads from the rest of Dalmatia and its cities of [[Zadar]], [[Split (city)|Split]] and [[\u0160ibenik railway station|\u0160ibenik]] pass through Knin, going north to the capital city of Croatia, [[Zagreb]], via [[M604 railway (Croatia)|M604 railway]]. There are four lines meeting in Knin station: to [[Perkovi\u0107, Croatia|Perkovi\u0107]] (and then to Split or [[\u0160ibenik railway station|\u0160ibenik]]), to Zadar, to [[Ogulin]] (and onwards to [[Karlovac]], Zagreb) and to [[Martin Brod]] (and [[Biha\u0107]], Sisak, Zagreb). Only the former three lines offer passenger transport. The latter route, Knin-Biha\u0107-Zagreb, passes through Bosnian territory, crossing the border many times, thus it is not used for passenger transport since the beginning of the war in 1991.

Around 1040, at the behest of the Croatian kings, a seat of the royal bishop was established in the nearby royal village of Biskupija (Kosovo), in the church of Saint Mary. The first \"bishop of the Croats\" is named ''Marko Giudice'', and he and his successors were attached to the royal court as preachers and king's \"special bishops\" until 1102.<ref>''[[Illyricum sacrum]]'', IV (Venice, 1775)</ref>{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|p=23}}\n\nIn the second half of the 11th century, Knin became a more permanent royal residence of king [[Demetrius Zvonimir of Croatia|Demetrius Zvonimir]] around 1080.

According to the 19th century Franciscan friar and historian [[Donato Fabianich]], the monastery of [[St. Catharines|Saint Catherine]] was founded around this time by the Knin dignitaries and nobility which were first settled there by Mladen \u0160ubi\u0107.<ref>Donato Fabianich, Storia dei fratri minori dai primordi della joro istituzione in Dal\u00b7 mazia e Bossina, fino ai giorni nostri, I, Zadar 1863, pp. 94.</ref> Their rule over Knin came to an end at the [[Battle of Bliska]] in 1322, after which the Angevin king [[Charles I of Hungary|Charles Robert]] arrived in the city and imprisoned the former lord [[Mladen II \u0160ubi\u0107 of Bribir]].{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|p=35}} Upon the departure of the king to Hungary, the noble [[Ivan Nelipi\u0107]] quickly seized Knin, and from there expelled the king's men from Croatia. Thus, these territories ''de facto'' continued to remain outside the monarchy, and the [[Nelipi\u0107 noble family]] made Knin their permanent seat and ruled their territories as \"Princes of Knin\".\n\nAfter successfully warring against their enemies, the Dalmatian cities and nobility under [[George II \u0160ubi\u0107 of Bribir|Juraj II \u0160ubi\u0107 of Bribir]] (who was imprisoned in the castle's dungeons), as well as the royal forces commanded by the [[Ban of Slavonia|Slavonian ban]] ''Mikac Prodani\u0107'',<ref>Miha Madijev, cap.

The previous bishop had likely been expelled, where the [[Republic of Ragusa|Ragusan]] Mihailo took his place, and was also given the office of the king's chancellor. These actions provoked a retaliation of king [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund]], whose armies besieged Knin in September 1390. The city, along with other territories were returned to Sigismund in 1393. Upon his return from the disastrous [[battle of Nicopolis]] in 1396, the king spent a month in Knin to consolidate his holdings and state affairs of Dalmatia and Croatia, issuing various decrees together with his ban [[Nicholas II Garai|Nikola Gorjanski]].{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|p=60}} In 1401, the city was besieged by the Bosnian king [[Stephen Ostoja]], who encamped in the adjacent Knin field (Kninsko polje), and remained there until the following year. The newly crowned king [[Ladislaus of Naples]] attained support from the castellan of Knin and issued his first decree there in 1403.\n\nBecause of frequent harassment, the citizens of Knin had to pay tribute to the duke [[Hrvoje Vuk\u010di\u0107 Hrvatini\u0107]], and for a short while, the city seemed to have been directly under his rule. The presence of [[Franciscans]] is for the first time mentioned in the 15th century, which were located in the old Saint Mary's church and monastery in the city.

In 1430 Knin and the Church of St. Bartolomeo in Kapitul were the centre of the \"Union and Brotherhood of the Croats\" ({{lang-la|unio et fraternitas Croatorum}}), a congregation of [[Croatian nobility|Croatian nobles]] formed by 12 [[counties of Croatia]] in order to \"preserve the fame and old customs of the Croatian Kingdom\".<ref>Mladen An\u010di\u0107: \"Desetlje\u0107e od 1091. do 1102. u zrcalu vrela\" (Summary: The decade between 1091 and 1102 according to the sources), Povijesni prilozi 17/1998, p. 253</ref><ref>Damir Karbi\u0107: Hrvatski plemi\u0107ki rod i obi\u010dajno pravo, p. 109-111</ref>\n\nIt was in 1420 that the Nelipi\u0107 noble family again regained their former role in Croatia with the emergence of [[Ivani\u0161 Nelipi\u0107]], which again distanced these territories from the crown. These possessions were later acquired after Ivani\u0161's death in 1435 by [[Ivan Frankopan|An\u017e]] of the [[House of Frankopan]] through the marriage with the Nelipi\u0107 nobles. Knin and the surrounding possessions were restored to the crown upon An\u017e's death in 1437.{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|p=68}} In 1454 an attempt between the Bosnian king and the Venetians was made to acquire the city, which was referenced as \"capital and foremost place of Croatia\" in their letters.{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|p=72}}\n\nDuring the reign of king [[Matthias Corvinus]], the bishops of Knin were selected as the king's principal orators abroad in collecting the help needed against the invading [[Ottoman Empire]]. The bishop was thus first secretly involved at the [[pope]] to solicit financial aid for Matthias' military campaign. The city's distant surroundings quickly became a target for Ottoman raids. As the raids were becoming more frequent, one of them reached Knin, where a Franciscan monastery has been recorded to have been destroyed in 1469.\n\nIn 1493, the first direct attempt of siege by the Ottomans was undertaken, which was followed by ban [[John Corvinus]] and his deputies invading and pillaging the Ottoman territories from the city. The Republic of Venice started to financially support the city's defences in fear for its possessions in Dalmatia. In 1501, three Ottoman spies were caught and imprisoned by the vice-ban. They were sent by the [[Sanjak of Bosnia|Sanjak-bey of Bosnia]], and had infiltrated Knin posing as friars that were on their way to sell [[vestment]]s to the market. They were to investigate the situation in the Zadar surrounding.{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|p=82}}\n\n[[File:KninPagano1525.png|thumb|right|280px|Knin castle, settlement and Kapitul around 1525, after Ottoman conquest from the map of Dalmatia from [[Matteo Pagano]]]]\nThe last major conflict around Knin before the truce was in September 1502 when 2,000 Ottoman cavalrymen looted the area.{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|p=84}} On 20 August 1503 King [[Vladislaus II of Hungary|Vladislaus II]] concluded a 7-year peace treaty with Sultan [[Bayezid II]].

A period of severe famine started in 1505 that affected entire Dalmatia. In 1510 the plague halved Knin's population.\n\nIn 1510 around 1,000 Ottoman [[Ak\u0131nc\u0131]] raided the countryside of Knin. There had been word that viceban of Croatia was captured on that occasion. Baltazar Ba\u0107an ({{lang-hu|Boldizs\u00e1r Batthy\u00e1ny}}), viceban of Slavonia, together with forces from the Zagreb Bishopry, managed to lift the siege of Knin in January 1513. Next year in February the Ottomans laid siege on Knin with 10,000 men from the Sanjak of Bosnia, but were unable to take the city and lost 500 troops. Knin's burg and outskirts were burned on this occasion.<ref>Vjekoslav Klai\u0107: Povijest Hrvata od najstarijih vremena do svr\u0161etka XIX. stolje\u0107a, Knjiga \u010detvrta, Zagreb, 1988, p. 302</ref>{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|p=88}} These clashes left Knin devastated and there was no news about the city for five years. Local population was decimated by war, hunger, plague and migration to safer places, and its economy was hindered by the seizure of crops and livestock. Due to Knin's strategic value, King [[Louis II of Hungary|Louis II]] responded to requests from captains of Knin, Skradin and Ostrovica and promised reinforcements of 1,000 infantry and 1,000 cavalrymen. However, it is unlikely that these forces arrived to the endangered towns.\n\nOn May 29, 1522, [[Siege of Knin|after the final siege]] of the Knin castle, it fell to the [[Ottoman Empire]],{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|p=89}} and Croats left the town in large numbers.

After the [[Peace of Pressburg (1805)|Peace of Pressburg]] in 1805, the French Empire gained the city and incorporated it into the [[Illyrian Provinces]] in 1809. By 1813, the Austrians regained control over the town. By the end of the 19th century, as a part of the [[Habsburg]] domain of Dalmatia, Knin grew steadily, becoming an important commercial as well as road and railway center. In 1867, Knin became a part of [[Dalmatia]] \u2013 a territorial entity within [[Cisleithania]]. After the [[First World War]] Knin became a part of the [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]] in 1918, which subsequently became part of the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] ([[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] after 1929).\n\n===Modern===\n====World War II====\nIn [[World War II in Yugoslavia|World War II]], Knin was in the so-called [[Independent State of Croatia#Zones of influence|second Italian occupation zone]], administered by civilian authorities of collaborationist [[Independent State of Croatia]] led by fascist Ustasa regime, but with heavy [[Fascist Italy (1922\u20131943)|Italian]] military presence. Italians also relied heavily on local ethnic Serb militias ([[Chetniks]]) to maintain order and surpress [[Yugoslav Partisans|partisan resistance]]. Chetniks and Ustasa officers collaborated as antifascist resistance intensified. Ustasa regime declared Knin [[Counties of the Independent State of Croatia|county seat]]. After [[Italian surrender]] in September 1943, German forces became the main factor in the region. As the war progressed and partisan forces liberated most of Dalmatia, with Germans pulling out and retreating northwards, Axis and partisan forces became pitted on Knin in a [[Battle of Knin|major battle]] in early December 1944. The [[8th Dalmatian Corps]] sought to destroy [[Nazi Germany|German]], [[Usta\u0161e]] and [[Chetniks|Chetnik]] formations in North [[Dalmatia]] and the city of Knin. With around 50 thousand troops involved and more than 7 thousand casulties on both sides, it was a decisive partisan victory. Knin was liberated on December 9th.\n\n====Socialist Yugoslavia====\n{{Expand section|date=April 2020}}\nBetween 1945 and 1990, Knin saw rapid industrialization and modernization, becoming a centre of a wider region.

NK Dinara's colours were black and white until 2005 when the club changed its colours to red, white and blue. NK Dinara plays in the 4th division in Croatia ([[1. \u017dupanijska liga \u0160ibensko-kninska]]). The logo of NK Dinara is red, white, and blue (in that order) with the letter \"D\" in the middle of the logo.\n\nKnin has a sports association which was formed in 1998. [[Basketball]] is also popular in Knin. The Croatian National basketball team has played a match in Knin. They played against [[Israel]] in 1999 where Croatia won the match 78:68. Other sports played in Knin are [[Rugby football|rugby]], [[team handball|handball]], [[volleyball]], [[kickboxing]], [[karate]], [[tennis]]  and [[taekwondo]].\n\n==Transport==\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2015}}\n[[File:Station Knin.JPG|thumb|right|Knin railway station building]]\nThe most important intercity roadway in Knin is the Croatian [[D1 (Croatia)|state route D1]]. The route makes for easy access of Knin from the major coastal city of [[Split (city)|Split]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}} The section of D1 from Knin to [[A1 (Croatia)|A1]] highway will be upgraded to the expressway level in following years (with [[B1 (Croatia)|B1]] expressway).\n\nKnin is also an important railway junction as the railroads from the rest of Dalmatia and its cities of [[Zadar]], [[Split (city)|Split]] and [[\u0160ibenik railway station|\u0160ibenik]] pass through Knin, going north to the capital city of Croatia, [[Zagreb]], via [[M604 railway (Croatia)|M604 railway]]. There are four lines meeting in Knin station: to [[Perkovi\u0107, Croatia|Perkovi\u0107]] (and then to Split or [[\u0160ibenik railway station|\u0160ibenik]]), to Zadar, to [[Ogulin]] (and onwards to [[Karlovac]], Zagreb) and to [[Martin Brod]] (and [[Biha\u0107]], Sisak, Zagreb). Only the former three lines offer passenger transport. The latter route, Knin-Biha\u0107-Zagreb, passes through Bosnian territory, crossing the border many times, thus it is not used for passenger transport since the beginning of the war in 1991. However, it is the shortest route between Knin and Zagreb, and as such was electrified in 1984 (the [[overhead line|catenary]] being subsequently destroyed by war operations in the early 1990s). [[Railway electrification system|Electrification]] had started from [[Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] inland towards the coast and had only reached Knin, so today the Knin station sidings are equipped with overhead catenary, but lines leaving the town are not.\n[[File:\u017deljezni\u010dki-kolodvor-postaja-Knin-05082016-02-roberta-f.jpg|thumb|right|Knin railway station's platforms, notice the lack of catenary wires, and the presence of the poles only]]\n\n==Towns and villages in the municipality==\n\n*[[Golubi\u0107, \u0160ibenik-Knin County|Golubi\u0107]]\n*Knin\n*[[Kninsko Polje]]\n*[[Kova\u010di\u0107, Croatia|Kova\u010di\u0107]]\n*[[Ljuba\u010d, \u0160ibenik-Knin County|Ljuba\u010d]]\n*[[O\u0107estovo]]\n*[[Plavno, Croatia|Plavno]]\n*[[Pola\u010da, \u0160ibenik-Knin County|Pola\u010da]]\n*[[Potkonje]]\n*[[Radljevac]]\n*[[Strmica, Croatia|Strmica]]\n*[[Vrpolje, Knin|Vrpolje]]\n*[[\u017dagrovi\u0107]]\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Croatia}}\n* [[Church of Saint Anthony, Knin]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{cite web|ref={{harvid|ICJ|3 February 2015}}|title=Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Croatia v.
