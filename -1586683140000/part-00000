Retrieved 25 August 2011.</ref>\n\n===Format for human-operated web browsers===\nThe User-Agent string format is currently specified by section 5.5.3 of  [http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-5.5.3 HTTP/1.1 Semantics and Content]. The format of the User-Agent string in HTTP is a list of product tokens (keywords) with optional comments. For example, if a user's product were called WikiBrowser, their user agent string might be ''WikiBrowser/1.0 Gecko/1.0''. The \"most important\" product component is listed first.\n\nThe parts of this string are as follows:\n\n* product name and version (''WikiBrowser/1.0'')\n* layout engine and version (''Gecko/1.0'')\n\nDuring the first [[browser wars|browser war]], many web servers were configured to send web pages that required advanced features, including [[Framing (World Wide Web)|frames]], to clients that were identified as some version of [[Mozilla]] only.<ref>[http://webaim.org/blog/user-agent-string-history/ History of the browser user-agent string]. WebAIM.</ref> Other browsers were considered to be older products such as [[Mosaic (web browser)|Mosaic]], [[Cello (web browser)|Cello]], or [[Samba (web browser)|Samba]], and would be sent a bare bones HTML document.\n\nFor this reason, most Web browsers use a User-Agent string value as follows:\n\n''Mozilla/[version] ([system and browser information]) [platform] ([platform details]) [extensions]''. For example, Safari on the iPad has used the following:\n\n Mozilla/5.0 (iPad; U; CPU OS 3_2_1 like Mac OS X; en-us) AppleWebKit/531.21.10 (KHTML, like Gecko) Mobile/7B405\n\nThe components of this string are as follows:\n\n* ''Mozilla/5.0'': Previously used to indicate compatibility with the Mozilla rendering engine.\n* ''(iPad; U; CPU OS 3_2_1 like Mac OS X; en-us)'': Details of the system in which the browser is running.\n* ''AppleWebKit/531.21.10'': The platform the browser uses.\n* ''(KHTML, like Gecko)'': Browser platform details.\n* ''Mobile/7B405'': This is used by the browser to indicate specific enhancements that are available directly in the browser or through third parties. An example of this is Microsoft Live Meeting which registers an extension so that the Live Meeting service knows if the software is already installed, which means it can provide a streamlined experience to joining meetings.\n\nBefore migrating to the [[Chromium (web browser)|Chromium]] code base, [[Opera (web browser)|Opera]] was the most widely used web browser that did not have the User-Agent string with \"Mozilla\" (instead beginning it with \"Opera\"). Since July 15, 2013,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://my.opera.com/ODIN/blog/2013/07/15/opera-user-agent-strings-opera-15-and-beyond |title=Opera User Agent Strings: Opera 15 and Beyond |publisher=dev.opera.com |date=15 July 2013 |accessdate=2014-05-05}}</ref> Opera's User-Agent string begins with \"Mozilla/5.0\" and, to avoid encountering legacy server rules, no longer includes the word \"Opera\" (instead using the string \"OPR\" to denote the Opera version).\n\n===Format for automated agents (bots) ===\nAutomated web crawling tools can use a simplified form, where an important field is contact information in case of problems.

Websites often include code to detect browser version to adjust the page design sent according to the user agent string received.

The high-pitched whine of his engine earned him the nickname of 'The hissing madman.'\" <ref>''The Manchester Guardian'', 26 June 1950, Page 7.</ref>\n\nAn advertisement from 1950 for the [[Allard J2 (original)|Allard J2]] stated: \"Some overseas purchasers have preferred to fit the more powerful engines suitable for this chassis such as American Ford, Mercury, Cadillac, [[Zora Arkus-Duntov|Ardun]], Grancor etc.\" <ref>''Motor Sport'', February 1950.</ref> Sydney Allard raced an Allard J2 Chrysler in the Tourist Trophy at [[Dundrod Circuit]] in 1951. Allards were exported to the United States as rolling chassis to be fitted with a motor on arrival. In the austerity period after the Second World War Allard struggled to source the raw materials for car construction, where the emphasis was on 'export or die.' <ref>''The British motor industry, 1945-1994: a case study in industrial decline'', by Timothy R. Whisler, OUP, 1999, Pages 3-4.</ref> It made no sense to import American engines and gearboxes only to turn round and export them again to the United States. Allard preparations for Le Mans in 1951 were delayed as Cadillac engines were in short supply, due to GM concentrating on production for the Korean War.<ref>''Motor Sport'', May 1951, Page 229.</ref>\n\nSydney Allard achieved international recognition by winning the 1952 [[Monte Carlo Rally]] in an [[Allard P1]], with co-driver Guy Warburton and navigator Tom Lush.<ref>''The Manchester Guardian'', 28 January 1952, Page 5.</ref> Starting from Glasgow he narrowly defeated [[Stirling Moss]], in a Sunbeam-Talbot 90, who finished second overall while competing in his first rally. The P1 was powered by a 4,375 c.c. Ford V8 side-valve motor. Mrs. Eleanor Allard, Sydney's wife, also competed in this event, accompanied by her sisters Edna and Hilda, but retired.\n\nAllard competed in the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1951, 1952 and 1953 but did not finish. In 1951 he shared a works J2 with the American driver Tom Cole and retired with gearbox failure.  In 1952 he and [[Jack Fairman]] drove the works J2X, chassis number 3055, fitted with a Chrysler hemi engine, where the car retired at 6.30 a.m. having thrown a rod.<ref>''Motor Sport'', July 1952, Page 314.</ref> In 1953 he shared a Cadillac-engined Allard J2R with [[Philip Fotheringham-Parker]], leading the race at the end of the first lap, but on lap four he was the first to retire with collapsed rear suspension and a severed brake pipe.<ref>''Motor Sport'', July 1953, Pages 340/341.</ref> In 1952 and 1953 a sister car was driven at Le Mans by [[Zora Arkus-Duntov]], a one-time Allard employee.<ref>''Corvette, 1968-1982'', by Mike Mueller, Motorbooks, 2000, Page 94.</ref> [[Carroll Shelby]] also raced an Allard-Cadillac J2 in the United States early in his driving career. Thus the successful Allard formula of an American V8 engine in a light chassis inspired the development of the Chevrolet Corvette and the A.C. Shelby Cobra.\n\nAn article on page 140 of the book ''Eagle Special Investigator'' by [[Macdonald Hastings]], features Sydney Allard in \"Special Investigator Drives a Racing Car\", published by [[Michael Joseph (publisher)|Michael Joseph]] in 1953.\n\nIn 1958 Allard built a Steyr-engined sports car for sprints and hillclimbs, the motor purchased from [[Dennis Poore]]: \"This Allard Special can certainly step off. It covered the top section of the Brighton kilometre at 125 m.p.h. and won its class at Shelsley Walsh and Prescott, and two classes at Stapleford.\" <ref>''Motor Sport'', November 1958, Page 731; ''Motor Racing'', November 1958, Page 386.</ref>  He finished third in the unlimited sports car class at the Brighton Speed Trials that year, covering the standing kilometre in 25.99 sec.<ref>''Motor Racing'', November 1958, Page 386.</ref> \"Allard's air-cooled Steyr-Allard with Lotus front wheels and very compact body was third - although a sports car, it was started by means of an external battery.\" <ref>''Motor Sport'', October 1958, Page 689.

The car was never successfully run and soon abandoned.\n\n==The 1960s: rallying, drag racing==\nIn the sixties Sydney Allard continued to compete in rallies mostly accompanied by Australian navigator Tom Fisk. They won their class in the 1963 Monte Carlo Rally in a Ford Allardette. Starting from Glasgow they reached Monte Carlo unpenalised.<ref>''The Guardian'', 23 January 1963, Page 4.</ref> In the 1964 Monte Allard hit a level-crossing in Czechoslovakia in his Ford Cortina and retired.<ref>''Motor Sport'', March 1964, Page 186.</ref> Allard's final outing in the Monte Carlo Rally came in 1965.\n[[File:1960 Allard Dragster.JPG|thumb|Allard slingshot dragster]]\nIn 1961 Sydney Allard, considered by many to be the father of British drag racing, built the Allard dragster, a supercharged Chrysler-powered slingshot.<ref>''Motor Sport'', September 1961, Page 756; ''Hot Rod Magazine'', March 1962, Pages 76-79.</ref> Constructed in 23 weeks between January and June 1961 at Adlards Garage, Clapham, in London, the car featured a 354-cubic inch Chrysler motor with front-mounted 6-71 GMC blower. Some speed equipment for the car was imported from [[Dean Moon]] in California.\n\nThe dragster was first shown at Brands Hatch in July 1961 and then demonstrated on 24 July on the straight of the club circuit at Silverstone, sans bodywork. The gearbox failed on this occasion. The first competitive appearance was at the [[Brighton Speed Trials]] on 2 September 1961. There was talk of a new track record over the kilometre from the Allard dragster with excitement reaching fever pitch. This only led to a huge disappointment when the fuel line ruptured on the line, completing the course on four cylinders in a time of 37.91 secs. The car continued to misfire on the second attempt. This was a blow from which the reputation of the car never fully recovered. [[Bill Boddy]], editor of ''Motor Sport'', called it a fiasco,<ref>''Motor Sport'', October 1961, Page 829.</ref>  saying the mechanical problems had also occurred in testing at Boreham. ''The Autocar'' described the Allard dragster as a \"gallant failure.\" <ref>''The Autocar'', 8 September 1961, Pages 378-379.</ref>\n\nThe car was then invited to appear over the standing start quarter mile at an N.S.A. record meeting at [[Wellesbourne Mountford Airfield|Wellesbourne Aerodrome]], near Stratford-Upon-Avon, on 14 October 1961. [[Denis Jenkinson]] writing in ''Motor Sport'' said:<blockquote>\n\"Sydney Allard pointed the sleek blue dragster down the quarter-mile, let in the clutch, opened up and with a sound like a large bomber going down the runway disappeared through the timing traps. Time : 10.841 sec., which made the motorcycle riders whistle a bit.\nThere were no arguments about the dragster's performance this time and \"sack-cloth and ashes\" were handed out to all dis-believers and certain Editors! [Congratulations, Sydney Allard- but a kilometre is a long quarter-mile and I still maintain that the dragster didn't live up to Allard high pressure pre-Brighton publicity.-[[Bill Boddy|ED]].]\" <ref>''Motor Sport'', November 1961, Page 948.</ref></blockquote>\nSadly few spectators witnessed this achievement. According to Jenkinson: \"Allard's temperamental machine eventually did 10.48 sec on its best run,\" <ref>''Motor Sport'', October 1963, Page 774.</ref> for the standing-start quarter mile, which took place at Debden, Essex on 14 April 1962.  This was the fastest quarter-mile time ever recorded in the U.K.<ref>''Motor Sport'', May 1962 Page 312. See also centre-spread photograph.</ref>\n\nThe car was demonstrated at the Festival of Motoring at Goodwood on 14 July 1962. At [[Brighton Speed Trials|Brighton]] on 15 September 1962 the Allard dragster clocked two runs at 22.30 and 22.04 seconds. A respectable performance but no outright win or record. ''Motor Sport'' reported: \"It appears that before the end of the Brighton kilometre the Allard dragster had burst the pipe between supercharger and engine, a common problem with such an installation and the reason why the Americans bolt their blowers on the engine, eliminating a long induction pipe.\" Allard then went to Church Fenton \"setting up the fastest s.s. kilometre achieved by a four-wheeled vehicle in this country\" - 20.86 secs. \"Allard also did a s.s. \u00bc-mile in 11.54 sec, and he crossed the line at 147.77 m.p.h. at the end of the longer distance, which rather disposes of previous claims in the 170-190 m.p.h. bracket.\" <ref>''Motor Sport'', November 1962, Page 866.</ref>\n\nIn 1963 the Allard put two rods through the block on Madeira Drive in Brighton.<ref>''Motor Sport'', October 1963, Page 769.</ref> The car turned out to be a fifties-style dragster at a time when dragster design was rapidly evolving. Tire technology, with wider purpose-built drag slicks, was pushing speeds ever higher in the U.S. By the time [[Mickey Thompson]] showed up at Brighton in 1963 with his Ford-powered ''Harvey Aluminum Special'' the Allard dragster was looking distinctly dated. But this charismatic car was the true pioneer of British drag racing and a game-changer as UK racers adopted American methods and style. Allard was instrumental in bringing Dante Duce and Mickey Thompson to England in 1963 to demonstrate their dragsters. Duce appeared at Silverstone on 10 September (press demonstration); with Thompson joining in at the [[Brighton Speed Trials]] on 14 September; Church Lawford, near Rugby, on 21 September and Debden, Essex, 22 September 1963.<ref>''Motor Sport'', November 1963, Page 864.</ref> Sydney Allard was awarded the [[SEMA]] trophy for his performances at the races.\n\nIn January 1964 Sydney Allard launched the Dragstar Dragon, a low-cost dragster designed by John Hume, powered by a Shorrock-supercharged 1,500 c.c. Ford engine,<ref>''The Times'', 4 January 1964.</ref>  costing under \u00a3500 in kit form.<ref>''Motor Sport'', January 1964, Page 8; ''The Observer'', 26 January 1964, Page 19.</ref> Several cars of this type were produced. Among the drivers were his son Alan Allard, Gerry Belton and [[Denis Jenkinson]]. Alan Allard and Belton demonstrated their dragsters at the [[1964 Italian Grand Prix]] at [[Autodromo Nazionale Monza|Monza]] on 6 September.<ref>''Motor Sport'', October 1964, Page 190.</ref>\n\nAllard founded the British Drag Racing Association, launched in June 1964, and served as its President.<ref>''Hot Rod Magazine'', January 1965, Pages 50-56. The vice-presidents of the BDRA were: \"World Record Motorcyclist George Brown, Group Captain Coulson, Chairman of the RAF Motor Sport Association, and [[Wally Parks]], president of the National Hot Rod Association of America,..\" Gerry Belton was the Secretary.</ref> He followed this with the International Drag Festivals held in England in 1964 <ref>''The Guardian'', 17 October 1964, Page 7.</ref> and 1965, featuring US dragsters and drivers. In 1964 [[Don Garlits]], [[Tommy Ivo]], Tony Nancy and Dante Duce participated in the First International Drag Festival, a six-event series that did much to promote the sport of drag racing in the UK. The 1964 Drag Festival was held at the following venues: [[Blackbushe Airport]], nr Camberley, Surrey, (twice: Sat 19 Sep, Sun 4 Oct), which was still an operational airport; [[RAF Chelveston]], Northants, (Sun 20 September); [[RAF Woodvale]], nr Southport, Lancashire (Sat 26 September); [[RAF Church Fenton]], nr Tadcaster, Yorkshire, (Sun 27 September); [[RAF Kemble]], nr Cirencester, Gloucestershire, (Sat 3 October).\n\nThe Second International Drag Festival was held at Blackbushe Airport, Sat/Sun 25/26 September 1965, and RAF Woodvale, Sun 3 October 1965. The Blackbushe event was affected by torrential rain: \"Unfortunately, the Blackbushe weekend was a financial catastrophe, and though Woodvale reduced the losses considerably, it was not enough to save Drag Festivals Ltd., who were forced to go into liquidation.\" <ref>[[Denis Jenkinson|D.S.J.]], ''Motor Sport'', March 1967, Page 190.</ref> A second Allard-Chrysler dragster \"was constructed for the 1965 Drag Festival.

The high-pitched whine of his engine earned him the nickname of 'The hissing madman.'\" <ref>''The Manchester Guardian'', 26 June 1950, Page 7.</ref>\n\nAn advertisement from 1950 for the [[Allard J2 (original)|Allard J2]] stated: \"Some overseas purchasers have preferred to fit the more powerful engines suitable for this chassis such as American Ford, Mercury, Cadillac, [[Zora Arkus-Duntov|Ardun]], Grancor etc.\" <ref>''Motor Sport'', February 1950.</ref> Sydney Allard raced an Allard J2 Chrysler in the Tourist Trophy at [[Dundrod Circuit]] in 1951. Allards were exported to the United States as rolling chassis to be fitted with a motor on arrival. In the austerity period after the Second World War Allard struggled to source the raw materials for car construction, where the emphasis was on 'export or die.' <ref>''The British motor industry, 1945-1994: a case study in industrial decline'', by Timothy R. Whisler, OUP, 1999, Pages 3-4.</ref> It made no sense to import American engines and gearboxes only to turn round and export them again to the United States. Allard preparations for Le Mans in 1951 were delayed as Cadillac engines were in short supply, due to GM concentrating on production for the Korean War.<ref>''Motor Sport'', May 1951, Page 229.</ref>\n\nSydney Allard achieved international recognition by winning the 1952 [[Monte Carlo Rally]] in an [[Allard P1]], with co-driver Guy Warburton and navigator Tom Lush.<ref>''The Manchester Guardian'', 28 January 1952, Page 5.</ref> Starting from Glasgow he narrowly defeated [[Stirling Moss]], in a Sunbeam-Talbot 90, who finished second overall while competing in his first rally. The P1 was powered by a 4,375 c.c. Ford V8 side-valve motor. Mrs. Eleanor Allard, Sydney's wife, also competed in this event, accompanied by her sisters Edna and Hilda, but retired.\n\nAllard competed in the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1951, 1952 and 1953 but did not finish. In 1951 he shared a works J2 with the American driver Tom Cole and retired with gearbox failure.  In 1952 he and [[Jack Fairman]] drove the works J2X, chassis number 3055, fitted with a Chrysler hemi engine, where the car retired at 6.30 a.m. having thrown a rod.<ref>''Motor Sport'', July 1952, Page 314.</ref> In 1953 he shared a Cadillac-engined Allard J2R with [[Philip Fotheringham-Parker]], leading the race at the end of the first lap, but on lap four he was the first to retire with collapsed rear suspension and a severed brake pipe.<ref>''Motor Sport'', July 1953, Pages 340/341.</ref> In 1952 and 1953 a sister car was driven at Le Mans by [[Zora Arkus-Duntov]], a one-time Allard employee.<ref>''Corvette, 1968-1982'', by Mike Mueller, Motorbooks, 2000, Page 94.</ref> [[Carroll Shelby]] also raced an Allard-Cadillac J2 in the United States early in his driving career. Thus the successful Allard formula of an American V8 engine in a light chassis inspired the development of the Chevrolet Corvette and the A.C. Shelby Cobra.\n\nAn article on page 140 of the book ''Eagle Special Investigator'' by [[Macdonald Hastings]], features Sydney Allard in \"Special Investigator Drives a Racing Car\", published by [[Michael Joseph (publisher)|Michael Joseph]] in 1953.\n\nIn 1958 Allard built a Steyr-engined sports car for sprints and hillclimbs, the motor purchased from [[Dennis Poore]]: \"This Allard Special can certainly step off. It covered the top section of the Brighton kilometre at 125 m.p.h. and won its class at Shelsley Walsh and Prescott, and two classes at Stapleford.\" <ref>''Motor Sport'', November 1958, Page 731; ''Motor Racing'', November 1958, Page 386.</ref>  He finished third in the unlimited sports car class at the Brighton Speed Trials that year, covering the standing kilometre in 25.99 sec.<ref>''Motor Racing'', November 1958, Page 386.</ref> \"Allard's air-cooled Steyr-Allard with Lotus front wheels and very compact body was third - although a sports car, it was started by means of an external battery.\" <ref>''Motor Sport'', October 1958, Page 689.

The car was never successfully run and soon abandoned.\n\n==The 1960s: rallying, drag racing==\nIn the sixties Sydney Allard continued to compete in rallies mostly accompanied by Australian navigator Tom Fisk. They won their class in the 1963 Monte Carlo Rally in a Ford Allardette. Starting from Glasgow they reached Monte Carlo unpenalised.<ref>''The Guardian'', 23 January 1963, Page 4.</ref> In the 1964 Monte Allard hit a level-crossing in Czechoslovakia in his Ford Cortina and retired.<ref>''Motor Sport'', March 1964, Page 186.</ref> Allard's final outing in the Monte Carlo Rally came in 1965.\n[[File:1960 Allard Dragster.JPG|thumb|Allard slingshot dragster]]\nIn 1961 Sydney Allard, considered by many to be the father of British drag racing, built the Allard dragster, a supercharged Chrysler-powered slingshot.<ref>''Motor Sport'', September 1961, Page 756; ''Hot Rod Magazine'', March 1962, Pages 76-79.</ref> Constructed in 23 weeks between January and June 1961 at Adlards Garage, Clapham, in London, the car featured a 354-cubic inch Chrysler motor with front-mounted 6-71 GMC blower. Some speed equipment for the car was imported from [[Dean Moon]] in California.\n\nThe dragster was first shown at Brands Hatch in July 1961 and then demonstrated on 24 July on the straight of the club circuit at Silverstone, sans bodywork. The gearbox failed on this occasion. The first competitive appearance was at the [[Brighton Speed Trials]] on 2 September 1961. There was talk of a new track record over the kilometre from the Allard dragster with excitement reaching fever pitch. This only led to a huge disappointment when the fuel line ruptured on the line, completing the course on four cylinders in a time of 37.91 secs. The car continued to misfire on the second attempt. This was a blow from which the reputation of the car never fully recovered. [[Bill Boddy]], editor of ''Motor Sport'', called it a fiasco,<ref>''Motor Sport'', October 1961, Page 829.</ref>  saying the mechanical problems had also occurred in testing at Boreham. ''The Autocar'' described the Allard dragster as a \"gallant failure.\" <ref>''The Autocar'', 8 September 1961, Pages 378-379.</ref>\n\nThe car was then invited to appear over the standing start quarter mile at an N.S.A. record meeting at [[Wellesbourne Mountford Airfield|Wellesbourne Aerodrome]], near Stratford-Upon-Avon, on 14 October 1961. [[Denis Jenkinson]] writing in ''Motor Sport'' said:<blockquote>\n\"Sydney Allard pointed the sleek blue dragster down the quarter-mile, let in the clutch, opened up and with a sound like a large bomber going down the runway disappeared through the timing traps. Time : 10.841 sec., which made the motorcycle riders whistle a bit.\nThere were no arguments about the dragster's performance this time and \"sack-cloth and ashes\" were handed out to all dis-believers and certain Editors! [Congratulations, Sydney Allard- but a kilometre is a long quarter-mile and I still maintain that the dragster didn't live up to Allard high pressure pre-Brighton publicity.-[[Bill Boddy|ED]].]\" <ref>''Motor Sport'', November 1961, Page 948.</ref></blockquote>\nSadly few spectators witnessed this achievement. According to Jenkinson: \"Allard's temperamental machine eventually did 10.48 sec on its best run,\" <ref>''Motor Sport'', October 1963, Page 774.</ref> for the standing-start quarter mile, which took place at Debden, Essex on 14 April 1962.  This was the fastest quarter-mile time ever recorded in the U.K.<ref>''Motor Sport'', May 1962 Page 312. See also centre-spread photograph.</ref>\n\nThe car was demonstrated at the Festival of Motoring at Goodwood on 14 July 1962. At [[Brighton Speed Trials|Brighton]] on 15 September 1962 the Allard dragster clocked two runs at 22.30 and 22.04 seconds. A respectable performance but no outright win or record. ''Motor Sport'' reported: \"It appears that before the end of the Brighton kilometre the Allard dragster had burst the pipe between supercharger and engine, a common problem with such an installation and the reason why the Americans bolt their blowers on the engine, eliminating a long induction pipe.\" Allard then went to Church Fenton \"setting up the fastest s.s. kilometre achieved by a four-wheeled vehicle in this country\" - 20.86 secs. \"Allard also did a s.s. \u00bc-mile in 11.54 sec, and he crossed the line at 147.77 m.p.h. at the end of the longer distance, which rather disposes of previous claims in the 170-190 m.p.h. bracket.\" <ref>''Motor Sport'', November 1962, Page 866.</ref>\n\nIn 1963 the Allard put two rods through the block on Madeira Drive in Brighton.<ref>''Motor Sport'', October 1963, Page 769.</ref> The car turned out to be a fifties-style dragster at a time when dragster design was rapidly evolving. Tire technology, with wider purpose-built drag slicks, was pushing speeds ever higher in the U.S. By the time [[Mickey Thompson]] showed up at Brighton in 1963 with his Ford-powered ''Harvey Aluminum Special'' the Allard dragster was looking distinctly dated. But this charismatic car was the true pioneer of British drag racing and a game-changer as UK racers adopted American methods and style. Allard was instrumental in bringing Dante Duce and Mickey Thompson to England in 1963 to demonstrate their dragsters. Duce appeared at Silverstone on 10 September (press demonstration); with Thompson joining in at the [[Brighton Speed Trials]] on 14 September; Church Lawford, near Rugby, on 21 September and Debden, Essex, 22 September 1963.<ref>''Motor Sport'', November 1963, Page 864.</ref> Sydney Allard was awarded the [[SEMA]] trophy for his performances at the races.\n\nIn January 1964 Sydney Allard launched the Dragstar Dragon, a low-cost dragster designed by John Hume, powered by a Shorrock-supercharged 1,500 c.c. Ford engine,<ref>''The Times'', 4 Jan 1964.</ref>  costing under \u00a3500 in kit form.<ref>''Motor Sport'', January 1964, Page 8; ''The Observer'', 26 January 1964, Page 19.</ref> Several cars of this type were produced. Among the drivers were his son Alan Allard, Gerry Belton and [[Denis Jenkinson]]. Alan Allard and Belton demonstrated their dragsters at the [[1964 Italian Grand Prix]] at [[Autodromo Nazionale Monza|Monza]] on 6 September.<ref>''Motor Sport'', October 1964, Page 190.</ref>\n\nAllard founded the British Drag Racing Association, launched in June 1964, and served as its President.<ref>''Hot Rod Magazine'', January 1965, Pages 50-56. The vice-presidents of the BDRA were: \"World Record Motorcyclist George Brown, Group Captain Coulson, Chairman of the RAF Motor Sport Association, and [[Wally Parks]], president of the National Hot Rod Association of America,..\" Gerry Belton was the Secretary.</ref> He followed this with the International Drag Festivals held in England in 1964 <ref>''The Guardian'', 17 October 1964, Page 7.</ref> and 1965, featuring US dragsters and drivers. In 1964 [[Don Garlits]], [[Tommy Ivo]], Tony Nancy and Dante Duce participated in the First International Drag Festival, a six-event series that did much to promote the sport of drag racing in the UK. The 1964 Drag Festival was held at the following venues: [[Blackbushe Airport]], nr Camberley, Surrey, (twice: Sat 19 Sep, Sun 4 Oct), which was still an operational airport; [[RAF Chelveston]], Northants, (Sun 20 September); [[RAF Woodvale]], nr Southport, Lancashire (Sat 26 September); [[RAF Church Fenton]], nr Tadcaster, Yorkshire, (Sun 27 September); [[RAF Kemble]], nr Cirencester, Gloucestershire, (Sat 3 October).\n\nThe Second International Drag Festival was held at Blackbushe Airport, Sat/Sun 25/26 September 1965, and RAF Woodvale, Sun 3 October 1965.
