Patients usually present with the skin eruption 1-2 weeks after use of the cytotoxic drug. Sometimes, the skin eruption can be painful. Skin eruptions can be located on the extremities, trunk, and face. Severe lesions are rare, and can mimic [[cellulitis]].

J Am Acad Dermatol. 1993 May;28(5 Pt 1):775-7.</ref>\n\n==Cause==\n\nThe overwhelming majority of neutrophilic eccrine hidradenitis (NEH) is seen in people with [[cancer]], especially [[leukaemia]], who receive chemotherapy with a [[cytotoxic drug]]. These include: [[Bleomycin]], [[chlorambucil]], [[cyclophosphamide]], [[cytarabine]], [[doxorubicin]], [[lomustine]], [[mitoxantrone]], [[topotecan]], and [[vincristine]].<ref>Mucocutaneous reactions to chemotherapy.

J Am Acad Dermatol. 1999;40(3):367-98.</ref> \n\nNEH was first described in 1982 in a patient with [[acute myeloid leukaemia]] (AML) who had received cytarabine as chemotherapy.<ref>Neutrophilic eccrine hidradenitis.

Harrist TJ, Fine JD, Berman RS, Murphy GF, Mihm MC Jr. Arch Dermatol. 1982;118(4):263-6.</ref> \n\nCancer itself, infections, and other medicinal drugs also can lead to NEH. NEH has been reported in patients with cancer who have not received any form of chemotherapy (i.e., as a [[paraneoplastic syndrome]]), in patients with [[HIV]] and/or [[AIDS]], and after the use of [[paracetamol]] (acetaminophen). Also the use of targeted agents can lead to NEH, e.g. [[imatinib]], a [[tyrosine kinase inhibitor]].<ref>Unusual manifestations of acute leukemia. Case 2.

In patients receiving chemotherapy, it has been postulated that a high concentration of the cytotoxic drug in sweat has a direct toxic effect on the eccrine glands.<ref>Neutrophilic eccrine hidradenitis: a distinctive rash associated with cytarabine therapy and acute leukemia. Flynn TC, Harrist TJ, Murphy GF, Loss RW, Moschella SL. J Am Acad Dermatol. 1984;11(4 Pt 1):584-90.</ref>\n\n==Diagnosis==\n\nIn all cases of suspected NEH, a skin biopsy should be performed, because the clinical symptoms are non specific, but the histopathological findings on the biopsy are specific. The biopsy shows characteristic changes of the [[eccrine glands]], the major sweat glands of the body.<ref>Neutrophilic hidradenitis induced by chemotherapy involves eccrine and apocrine glands. Brehler R, Reimann S, Bonsmann G, Metze D. Am J Dermatopathol. 1997;19(1):73-8.</ref> \n\nIn NEH, eccrine gland [[necrosis]], and [[neutrophils]] surroundings the eccrine glands, are typical findings on biopsy. If the chemotherapy has recently been administered, chemotherapy induced [[neutropenia]] may be present, and, as a result, the neutrophils may be absent. But the other characteristic finding, i.e. eccrine gland necrosis, can still be seen. A vacuolar interface [[dermatitis]] also is visible in glands and ducts, along with necrosis of the lining cells. \n\nIn addition, in patients receiving chemotherapy, keratinocyte atypia can be seen.<ref>Smoller BR, Horn TD. Chemotherapy-induced drug eruptions. In: Dermatopathology in systemic disease. Smoller BR, Horn TD (Eds). Oxford University Press. 2001.</ref> \n\n==Prevention==\n\nA single case report suggested that oral [[dapsone]] may be useful for prevention. However, the efficacy of oral dapsone as prevention has not been demonstrated very clearly until now.<ref>Dapsone in prevention of recurrent neutrophilic eccrine hidradenitis. Shear NH, Knowles SR, Shapiro L, Poldre P. J Am Acad Dermatol. 1996;35(5 Pt 2):819-22.</ref> \n\n==Treatment==\n\nNEH is self-limited and usually resolves without treatment. In the overwhelming majority of the cases, spontaneous resolution occurs within 1\u20132 weeks. \n\nHowever, if the patient developed NEH after chemotherapy, the offending cytotoxic drug has to be discontinued, and the patient must avoid this particular cytotoxic drug in the future, because NEH usually re occurs upon re exposure to the same cytotoxic drug.<ref>Recurrent neutrophilic eccrine hidradenitis. Bernstein EF, Spielvogel RL, Topolsky DL. Br J Dermatol. 1992;127(5):529-33.</ref> \n\nDespite the fact that NEH is self limited and usually resolves without treatment, some researchers use treatment, mainly systemic corticosteroids, although the efficacy of such a therapy has not been demonstrated in a large randomised controlled clinical trial until now.<ref>Neutrophilic eccrine hidradenitis associated with Hodgkin\u2019s disease and chemotherapy.

Patients usually present with the skin eruption 1-2 weeks after use of the cytotoxic drug. Sometimes, the skin eruption can be painful. Skin eruptions can be located on the extremities, trunk, and face. Severe lesions are rare, and can mimic [[cellulitis]]. Generalised lesions resembling [[erythema multiforme]] have been reported.<ref>Neutrophilic eccrine hidradenitis. Thorisdottir K, Tomecki KJ, Bergfeld WF, Andresen SW. J Am Acad Dermatol. 1993 May;28(5 Pt 1):775-7.</ref>\n\n==Cause==\n\nThe overwhelming majority of neutrophilic eccrine hidradenitis (NEH) is seen in people with [[cancer]], especially [[leukaemia]], who receive chemotherapy with a [[cytotoxic drug]]. These include: [[Bleomycin]], [[chlorambucil]], [[cyclophosphamide]], [[cytarabine]], [[doxorubicin]], [[lomustine]], [[mitoxantrone]], [[topotecan]], and [[vincristine]].<ref>Mucocutaneous reactions to chemotherapy. Susser WS, Whitaker-Worth DL, Grant-Kels JM. J Am Acad Dermatol. 1999;40(3):367-98.</ref> \n\nNEH was first described in 1982 in a patient with [[acute myeloid leukaemia]] (AML) who had received cytarabine as chemotherapy.<ref>Neutrophilic eccrine hidradenitis. A distinctive type of neutrophilic dermatosis associated with myelogenous leukemia and chemotherapy. Harrist TJ, Fine JD, Berman RS, Murphy GF, Mihm MC Jr. Arch Dermatol. 1982;118(4):263-6.</ref> \n\nCancer itself, infections, and other medicinal drugs also can lead to NEH. NEH has been reported in patients with cancer who have not received any form of chemotherapy (i.e., as a [[paraneoplastic syndrome]]), in patients with [[HIV]] and/or [[AIDS]], and after the use of [[paracetamol]] (acetaminophen). Also the use of targeted agents can lead to NEH, e.g. [[imatinib]], a [[tyrosine kinase inhibitor]].<ref>Unusual manifestations of acute leukemia. Case 2.

Ben-Amitai D, Hodak E, Landau M, Metzker A, Feinmesser M, David M. Eur J Pediatr. 2001 Mar;160(3):189-91.</ref>\n\nThe exact cause of NEH is unknown. In patients receiving chemotherapy, it has been postulated that a high concentration of the cytotoxic drug in sweat has a direct toxic effect on the eccrine glands.<ref>Neutrophilic eccrine hidradenitis: a distinctive rash associated with cytarabine therapy and acute leukemia. Flynn TC, Harrist TJ, Murphy GF, Loss RW, Moschella SL. J Am Acad Dermatol. 1984;11(4 Pt 1):584-90.</ref>\n\n==Diagnosis==\n\nIn all cases of suspected NEH, a skin biopsy should be performed, because the clinical symptoms are non specific, but the histopathological findings on the biopsy are specific. The biopsy shows characteristic changes of the [[eccrine glands]], the major sweat glands of the body.<ref>Neutrophilic hidradenitis induced by chemotherapy involves eccrine and apocrine glands. Brehler R, Reimann S, Bonsmann G, Metze D. Am J Dermatopathol. 1997;19(1):73-8.</ref> \n\nIn NEH, eccrine gland [[necrosis]], and [[neutrophils]] surroundings the eccrine glands, are typical findings on biopsy. If the chemotherapy has recently been administered, chemotherapy induced [[neutropenia]] may be present, and, as a result, the neutrophils may be absent. But the other characteristic finding, i.e. eccrine gland necrosis, can still be seen. A vacuolar interface [[dermatitis]] also is visible in glands and ducts, along with necrosis of the lining cells. \n\nIn addition, in patients receiving chemotherapy, keratinocyte atypia can be seen.<ref>Smoller BR, Horn TD. Chemotherapy-induced drug eruptions. In: Dermatopathology in systemic disease. Smoller BR, Horn TD (Eds). Oxford University Press. 2001.</ref> \n\n==Prevention==\n\nA single case report suggested that oral [[dapsone]] may be useful for prevention. However, the efficacy of oral dapsone as prevention has not been demonstrated very clearly until now.<ref>Dapsone in prevention of recurrent neutrophilic eccrine hidradenitis. Shear NH, Knowles SR, Shapiro L, Poldre P. J Am Acad Dermatol. 1996;35(5 Pt 2):819-22.</ref> \n\n==Treatment==\n\nNEH is self-limited and usually resolves without treatment. In the overwhelming majority of the cases, spontaneous resolution occurs within 1\u20132 weeks. \n\nHowever, if the patient developed NEH after chemotherapy, the offending cytotoxic drug has to be discontinued, and the patient must avoid this particular cytotoxic drug in the future, because NEH usually re occurs upon re exposure to the same cytotoxic drug.<ref>Recurrent neutrophilic eccrine hidradenitis. Bernstein EF, Spielvogel RL, Topolsky DL. Br J Dermatol. 1992;127(5):529-33.</ref> \n\nDespite the fact that NEH is self limited and usually resolves without treatment, some researchers use treatment, mainly systemic corticosteroids, although the efficacy of such a therapy has not been demonstrated in a large randomised controlled clinical trial until now.<ref>Neutrophilic eccrine hidradenitis associated with Hodgkin\u2019s disease and chemotherapy.

Johnson]] had served during two presidential terms, the [[22nd Amendment]] did not disqualify Johnson from running for another term, because he had only served 14 months following [[John F. Kennedy assassination|John F. Kennedy's assassination]] before being [[Second inauguration of Lyndon B. Johnson|sworn in]] for his \"full\" term in January 1965. As a result, it was widely assumed when 1968 began that President Johnson would be a Democratic candidate, and that he would have little trouble in winning the Democratic nomination.\n\nDespite the growing opposition to Johnson's policies in Vietnam in both Congress and in the public, no prominent Democratic politician was prepared to run against a sitting President of his own party. Anti-war activists of the new \"[[Dump Johnson movement]]\" initially approached [[United States Senate|United States Senator]] [[Robert F. Kennedy]] of [[New York (state)|New York]], an outspoken critic of Johnson's policies with a large base of support, for a candidacy, but he declined to run. They then appealed to [[United States Senate|United States Senator]] [[Eugene McCarthy]] of [[Minnesota]], who was willing to openly challenge Johnson; prior to entering the race, McCarthy had hoped that Kennedy would run as well.<ref>{{cite book|last=Sandbrook|first=Dominic|title=Eugene McCarthy: The Rise and Fall of Postwar American Liberalism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wMqSzTPXl7QC&pg=PA188|date=2007-12-18|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-307-42577-5|page=188}}</ref> Running as an anti-war candidate in the [[New Hampshire primary]], McCarthy hoped to pressure the Democrats into publicly opposing the Vietnam War. Trailing badly in national polls and with little chance to influence delegate selection absent primary wins, McCarthy decided to pour most of his resources into [[New Hampshire primary|New Hampshire]], the first state to hold a [[primary election]]. He was boosted by thousands of young college students who volunteered throughout the state, who shaved their beards and cut their hair to \"Get Clean for Gene.\"\n\nOn March 12, McCarthy won 42% of the primary vote to Johnson's 49%, an extremely strong showing for such a challenger, and one which gave McCarthy's campaign legitimacy and momentum. In a surprise move on March 16, Robert F. Kennedy renounced his earlier support for Johnson and proclaimed his own candidacy. McCarthy and his supporters viewed this as opportunism, creating a lasting enmity between the campaigns. To make matters worse, a poll in Wisconsin showed McCarthy beating the President badly, with the latter only getting 12% of the vote.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://time.com/5682760/incumbent-presidents-primary-challenges/|title=Could Trump Lose the Republican Nomination?

On March 31, 1968, at the end of a televised address regarding the War, the President shocked the nation by announcing that he would not seek re-election.  By withdrawing from the race, he could avoid the stigma of defeat and could keep control of the party machinery to support [[Hubert Humphrey]], his loyal [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]]. As the year developed, it also became clear that Johnson believed he could secure his place in the history books by ending the war before the election in November, thus giving Humphrey the boost he would need to win.<ref>Dallek (1998); Woods (2006); Gould (1993).</ref>\n\nWith Johnson's withdrawal, the [[New Deal Coalition]] effectively dissolved into support for different candidates:\n\n* [[Hubert Humphrey]], Johnson's Vice President, gained the support of labor unions and big-city party bosses (such as Chicago Mayor [[Richard J. Daley]]), who had been the Democratic Party's primary power base since the days of President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]. It was also believed that President Johnson himself was covertly supporting Humphrey, despite public claims of neutrality.\n* McCarthy rallied students and intellectuals who had been the early activists against the war in Vietnam;\n* Kennedy gained the support of  the poor, [[Catholics]], [[African American]]s, and other racial and ethnic minorities;\n* Conservative white [[Southern Democrats]], or \"[[Dixiecrats]],\" their influence declining swiftly in the national party, tended to support either Vice President Humphrey or [[George C. Wallace]] and the Alabama governor's third-party campaign in the general election.\n\n==Contest for the Democratic nomination==\n[[File:SWPC-RFK-C004-003.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Kennedy campaigning in Los Angeles (photo courtesy of ''John F.

Smathers]] from [[Florida]], [[United States Senate|United States Senator]] [[Stephen M. Young]] from [[Ohio]], and [[Governor of Indiana|Governor]] [[Roger D. Branigin]] of [[Indiana]].\n\nHumphrey's campaign concentrated on winning the delegates in non-primary states, where party leaders controlled the delegate votes. Kennedy defeated Branigin and McCarthy in the Indiana primary, and then defeated McCarthy in the Nebraska primary. However, McCarthy upset Kennedy in the Oregon primary.\n\nAfter Kennedy's defeat in Oregon, the California primary was seen as crucial to both Kennedy and McCarthy. McCarthy stumped the state's many colleges and universities, where he was treated as a hero for being the first presidential candidate to oppose the war. Kennedy campaigned in the ghettos and [[barrio]]s of the state's larger cities, where he was mobbed by enthusiastic supporters. Kennedy and McCarthy engaged in a television debate a few days before the election; it was generally considered a draw.  On June 4, Kennedy defeated McCarthy in California, 46% to 42%, and also won the South Dakota primary held the same day.  McCarthy, who defeated Kennedy in New Jersey that very same night, refused to withdraw from the presidential race and made it clear that he would contest Kennedy in the upcoming [[New York (state)|New York]] primary, where McCarthy had much support from antiwar activists in [[New York City]].\n \nAfter giving his victory speech at the [[Ambassador Hotel (Los Angeles)|Ambassador Hotel]] in [[Los Angeles|Los Angeles, California]], [[Robert F.

The loss of his campaign, which had relied on his popularity and charisma convincing non-primary delegates to support him at the convention, meant that the anti-war movement was effectively kaput, and that Humphrey would be the prohibitive favorite for the nomination.  Some of Kennedy's support went to McCarthy, but many of Kennedy's delegates, remembering their bitter primary battles with McCarthy, rallied around the late-starting candidacy of Senator [[George McGovern]] of [[South Dakota]], a Kennedy supporter in the spring primaries.\n\nWhen the [[1968 Democratic National Convention]] opened in [[Chicago]], thousands of young antiwar activists from around the nation gathered in the city to protest the Vietnam War. In a clash which was covered on live television, Americans were shocked to see [[Chicago Police]] officers brutally beating anti-war protesters. While the protesters chanted \"the whole world is watching\", the police used clubs and tear gas to beat back the protesters, leaving many of them bloody and dazed. The tear gas even wafted into numerous hotel suites; in one of them Vice President Humphrey was watching the proceedings on television. Meanwhile, the convention itself was marred by the strong-arm tactics of Chicago's mayor [[Richard J. Daley]] (who was seen on television angrily cursing Connecticut senator [[Abraham Ribicoff]], who made a speech at the convention denouncing the excesses of the Chicago police in the riots).\n\nIn the end, the nomination itself was anticlimactic, with Vice President Humphrey handily beating McCarthy and McGovern on the first ballot. The convention then chose Senator [[Edmund Muskie]] of [[Maine]] as Humphrey's running mate. However, the tragedy of the antiwar riots crippled the Humphrey campaign from the start, and it never fully recovered.

Johnson]] had served during two presidential terms, the [[22nd Amendment]] did not disqualify Johnson from running for another term, because he had only served 14 months following [[John F. Kennedy assassination|John F. Kennedy's assassination]] before being [[Second inauguration of Lyndon B. Johnson|sworn in]] for his \"full\" term in January 1965. As a result, it was widely assumed when 1968 began that President Johnson would be a Democratic candidate, and that he would have little trouble in winning the Democratic nomination.\n\nDespite the growing opposition to Johnson's policies in Vietnam in both Congress and in the public, no prominent Democratic politician was prepared to run against a sitting President of his own party. Anti-war activists of the new \"[[Dump Johnson movement]]\" initially approached [[United States Senate|United States Senator]] [[Robert F. Kennedy]] of [[New York (state)|New York]], an outspoken critic of Johnson's policies with a large base of support, for a candidacy, but he declined to run. They then appealed to [[United States Senate|United States Senator]] [[Eugene McCarthy]] of [[Minnesota]], who was willing to openly challenge Johnson; prior to entering the race, McCarthy had hoped that Kennedy would run as well.<ref>{{cite book|last=Sandbrook|first=Dominic|title=Eugene McCarthy: The Rise and Fall of Postwar American Liberalism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wMqSzTPXl7QC&pg=PA188|date=2007-12-18|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-307-42577-5|page=188}}</ref> Running as an anti-war candidate in the [[New Hampshire primary]], McCarthy hoped to pressure the Democrats into publicly opposing the Vietnam War. Trailing badly in national polls and with little chance to influence delegate selection absent primary wins, McCarthy decided to pour most of his resources into [[New Hampshire primary|New Hampshire]], the first state to hold a [[primary election]]. He was boosted by thousands of young college students who volunteered throughout the state, who shaved their beards and cut their hair to \"Get Clean for Gene.\"\n\nOn March 12, McCarthy won 42% of the primary vote to Johnson's 49%, an extremely strong showing for such a challenger, and one which gave McCarthy's campaign legitimacy and momentum. In a surprise move on March 16, Robert F. Kennedy renounced his earlier support for Johnson and proclaimed his own candidacy. McCarthy and his supporters viewed this as opportunism, creating a lasting enmity between the campaigns. To make matters worse, a poll in Wisconsin showed McCarthy beating the President badly, with the latter only getting 12% of the vote.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://time.com/5682760/incumbent-presidents-primary-challenges/|title=Could Trump Lose the Republican Nomination?

On March 31, 1968, at the end of a televised address regarding the War, the President shocked the nation by announcing that he would not seek re-election.  By withdrawing from the race, he could avoid the stigma of defeat and could keep control of the party machinery to support [[Hubert Humphrey]], his loyal [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]]. As the year developed, it also became clear that Johnson believed he could secure his place in the history books by ending the war before the election in November, thus giving Humphrey the boost he would need to win.<ref>Dallek (1998); Woods (2006); Gould (1993).</ref>\n\nWith Johnson's withdrawal, the [[New Deal Coalition]] effectively dissolved into support for different candidates:\n\n* [[Hubert Humphrey]], Johnson's Vice President, gained the support of labor unions and big-city party bosses (such as Chicago Mayor [[Richard J. Daley]]), who had been the Democratic Party's primary power base since the days of President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]. It was also believed that President Johnson himself was covertly supporting Humphrey, despite public claims of neutrality.\n* McCarthy rallied students and intellectuals who had been the early activists against the war in Vietnam;\n* Kennedy gained the support of  the poor, [[Catholics]], [[African American|African-Americans]], and other racial and ethnic minorities;\n* Conservative white [[Southern Democrats]], or \"[[Dixiecrats]],\" their influence declining swiftly in the national party, tended to support either Vice President Humphrey or [[George C.

Smathers]] from [[Florida]], [[United States Senate|United States Senator]] [[Stephen M. Young]] from [[Ohio]], and [[Governor of Indiana|Governor]] [[Roger D. Branigin]] of [[Indiana]].\n\nHumphrey's campaign concentrated on winning the delegates in non-primary states, where party leaders controlled the delegate votes. Kennedy defeated Branigin and McCarthy in the Indiana primary, and then defeated McCarthy in the Nebraska primary. However, McCarthy upset Kennedy in the Oregon primary.\n\nAfter Kennedy's defeat in Oregon, the California primary was seen as crucial to both Kennedy and McCarthy. McCarthy stumped the state's many colleges and universities, where he was treated as a hero for being the first presidential candidate to oppose the war. Kennedy campaigned in the ghettos and [[barrio]]s of the state's larger cities, where he was mobbed by enthusiastic supporters. Kennedy and McCarthy engaged in a television debate a few days before the election; it was generally considered a draw.  On June 4, Kennedy defeated McCarthy in California, 46% to 42%, and also won the South Dakota primary held the same day.  McCarthy, who defeated Kennedy in New Jersey that very same night, refused to withdraw from the presidential race and made it clear that he would contest Kennedy in the upcoming [[New York (state)|New York]] primary, where McCarthy had much support from antiwar activists in [[New York City]].\n \nAfter giving his victory speech at the [[Ambassador Hotel (Los Angeles)|Ambassador Hotel]] in [[Los Angeles|Los Angeles, California]], [[Robert F.

The loss of his campaign, which had relied on his popularity and charisma convincing non-primary delegates to support him at the convention, meant that the anti-war movement was effectively kaput, and that Humphrey would be the prohibitive favorite for the nomination.  Some of Kennedy's support went to McCarthy, but many of Kennedy's delegates, remembering their bitter primary battles with McCarthy, rallied around the late-starting candidacy of Senator [[George McGovern]] of [[South Dakota]], a Kennedy supporter in the spring primaries.\n\nWhen the [[1968 Democratic National Convention]] opened in [[Chicago]], thousands of young antiwar activists from around the nation gathered in the city to protest the Vietnam War. In a clash which was covered on live television, Americans were shocked to see [[Chicago Police]] officers brutally beating anti-war protesters. While the protesters chanted \"the whole world is watching\", the police used clubs and tear gas to beat back the protesters, leaving many of them bloody and dazed. The tear gas even wafted into numerous hotel suites; in one of them Vice President Humphrey was watching the proceedings on television. Meanwhile, the convention itself was marred by the strong-arm tactics of Chicago's mayor [[Richard J. Daley]] (who was seen on television angrily cursing Connecticut senator [[Abraham Ribicoff]], who made a speech at the convention denouncing the excesses of the Chicago police in the riots).\n\nIn the end, the nomination itself was anticlimactic, with Vice President Humphrey handily beating McCarthy and McGovern on the first ballot. The convention then chose Senator [[Edmund Muskie]] of [[Maine]] as Humphrey's running mate. However, the tragedy of the antiwar riots crippled the Humphrey campaign from the start, and it never fully recovered.

Although flies are most commonly attracted to [[open wound]]s and [[urine]]- or [[feces]]-soaked fur, some species (including the most common myiatic flies\u2014the [[botfly]], [[Calliphoridae|blowfly]], and [[Cochliomyia hominivorax|screwfly]]) can create an infestation even on unbroken skin and have been known to use moist soil and non-myiatic flies (such as the common [[housefly]]) as [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector agents]] for their parasitic larvae.\n\nBecause some animals (particularly domestic animals) cannot react as effectively as humans to the causes and effects of myiasis, [[Parasitic flies of domestic animals|such infestations]] present a severe and continuing problem for [[livestock]] industries worldwide, causing severe economic losses where they are not mitigated by human action.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Otranto |first=Domenico |date=2001 |title=The immunology of myiasis: parasite survival and host defense strategies |journal=Trends in Parasitology |volume=17 |issue=4 |pages=176\u2013182 |doi=10.1016/S1471-4922(00)01943-7 |pmid=11282507}}</ref> Although typically a far greater issue for animals, myiasis is also a relatively frequent affliction of humans in rural tropical regions where myiatic flies thrive, and often may require medical attention to surgically remove the parasites.<ref name=\"John 2006. p. 328-334\">{{cite book |editor1-last=John |editor1-first=David |editor2-last=Petri |date=2006 |editor2-first=William |title=Markell and Voge's Medical Parasitology |edition=9th |location=Missouri |publisher=Saunders Elsevier |isbn=978-0-7216-4793-7 |pages=328\u2013334}}</ref>\n\nMyiasis varies widely in the forms it takes and its effects on the victims.

The female [[Fly|flies]] lay their eggs on the sheep in damp, protected areas of the body that are soaked with urine and feces, mainly the sheep's breech ([[buttocks]]). It takes approximately eight hours to a day for the eggs to hatch, depending on the conditions. Once hatched, the larvae then lacerate the skin with their mouthparts, causing open sores. Once the skin has been breached, the larvae then tunnel through the sores into the host's [[subcutaneous tissue]], causing deep and irritating [[lesion]]s highly subject to infection. After about the second day, [[bacteria]]l [[infection]] is likely and, if left untreated, causes [[bacteremia|bacterial bloodstream infections]] or [[sepsis]]. This leads to [[Anorexia (symptom)|anorexia]] and weakness and is generally fatal if untreated.\n\n===Human vectors===\nThere are three main [[Diptera|fly]] families causing economically important myiasis in livestock and also, occasionally, in humans:\n* [[Calliphoridae]] (blowflies)\n**Some examples include ''[[Calliphora vomitoria]]'' and ''Calliphora vicina'' \n* [[Oestridae]] ([[Botfly|botflies]])\n* [[Sarcophagidae]] (fleshflies) ''[[Sarcophaga barbata]]'' are usually found in dead and rotting meat and animal excrement, which are prime environments for them. This is because their larvae are facultative [[parasites]], as they feed on organic tissue and use the hosts' oxygen reserve.\n\nOther families occasionally involved are:\n* [[Anisopodidae]]\n* [[Piophilidae]]\n* [[Stratiomyidae]]\n* [[Syrphidae]]\n\n====Specific myiasis====\nCaused by flies that need a host for larval development\n* ''[[Dermatobia hominis]]'' (human botfly)\n* ''[[Cordylobia anthropophaga]]'' (tumbu fly)\n* ''[[Oestrus ovis]]'' (sheep botfly)\n* ''[[Hypoderma (fly)|Hypoderma]]'' spp. (cattle botflies or ox warbles)\n* ''[[Gasterophilus]]'' spp. (horse botfly)\n* ''[[Cochliomyia hominivorax]]'' (new world screwworm fly)\n* ''[[Chrysomya bezziana]]'' (old world screwworm fly)\n* ''[[Auchmeromyia senegalensis]]'' (Congo floor maggot)\n* ''[[Cuterebra]]'' spp. (rodent and rabbit botfly)\n\n====Semispecific myiasis====\nCaused by flies that usually lay their eggs in decaying animal or vegetable matter, but that can develop in a host if open wounds or sores are present\n*''[[Lucilia (fly)|Lucilia]]'' spp. (green-bottle fly)\n*''[[Cochliomyia]]'' spp. (screw-worm fly)\n*''[[Phormia]]'' spp. (black-bottle fly)\n*''[[Calliphora]]'' spp. (blue-bottle fly)\n*''[[Sarcophaga]]'' spp. (flesh fly or sarcophagids)\n\nFlesh flies, or ''sarcophagids'', members of the family ''Sarcophagidae'', can cause [[Intestine|intestinal]] myiasis in humans if the females lay their eggs on meat or fruit.\n\n====Accidental myiasis====\nAlso called pseudomyiasis. Caused by flies that have no preference or need to develop in a host but that will do so on rare occasions. Transmission occurs through accidental deposit of eggs on oral or genitourinary openings, or by swallowing eggs or larvae that are on food.\n*''[[Musca domestica]]'' (housefly)\n*''[[Fannia (genus)|Fannia]]'' spp. (latrine flies)\n*''[[Eristalis tenax]]'' (rat-tailed maggots)\n*''[[Muscina]] spp.\n\nThe adult flies are not parasitic, but when they lay their eggs in open [[wound]]s and these hatch into their [[larva]]l stage (also known as [[maggot]]s or [[Larva|grub]]s), the larvae feed on live and/or necrotic tissue, causing myiasis to develop. They may also be ingested or enter through other body apertures.\n\n== Diagnosis ==\nMyiasis is often misdiagnosed in the United States because it is rare and its symptoms are not specific. Intestinal myiasis and urinary myiasis are especially difficult to diagnose.<ref name=\"John 2006. p. 328-334\"/>\n\nClues that myiasis may be present include recent travel to an endemic area, one or more non-healing lesions on the skin, itchiness, movement under the skin or pain, discharge from a central punctum (tiny hole), or a small, white structure protruding from the lesion.<ref name=\"Adisa 2004\">{{cite journal |last1=Adisa |first1=Charles Adeyinka |last2=Mbanaso |first2=Augustus |date=2004 |title=Furuncular myiasis of the breast caused by the larvae of the Tumbu fly (''Cordylobia anthropophaga'') |journal=BMC Surgery |volume=4 |page=5 |doi=10.1186/1471-2482-4-5 |pmc=394335 |pmid=15113429}}</ref> Serologic testing has also been used to diagnose the presence of botfly larvae in human ophthalmomyiasis.<ref name=lag/>\n\n<gallery>\nFile:UOTW 22 - Ultrasound of the Week 1.webm|Ultrasound showing maggot infestation<ref name=\"UOTW22\">{{cite web|title=UOTW #22 - Ultrasound of the Week|url=https://www.ultrasoundoftheweek.com/uotw-22/|website=Ultrasound of the Week|accessdate=27 May 2017|date=14 October 2014}}</ref>\nFile:UOTW 22 - Ultrasound of the Week 2.webm|Ultrasound showing maggot infestation<ref name=\"UOTW22\"/>\nFile:UOTW 22 - Ultrasound of the Week 3.jpg|Ultrasound showing maggot infestation<ref name=\"UOTW22\"/>\n</gallery>\n\n===Classifications===\n[[Germany|German]] [[Entomology|entomologist]] [[Fritz Konrad Ernst Zumpt|Fritz Zumpt]] describes myiasis as \"the infestation of live human and vertebrate animals with dipterous larvae, which at least for a period, feed on the host's dead or living tissue, liquid body substances, or ingested food\". For modern purposes however, this is too vague. For example, feeding on dead or necrotic tissue is not generally a problem except when larvae such as those of [[Cheese fly|flies in the family Piophilidae]] attack stored food such as cheese or preserved meats; such activity suggests [[Saprotrophic nutrition|saprophagy]] rather than parasitism; it even may be medically beneficial in [[Maggot therapy|maggot debridement therapy (MDT)]].\n\nCurrently myiasis commonly is classified according to aspects relevant to the case in question:\n* The classical description of myiasis is according to the part of the host that is infected. This is the classification used by [[ICD|ICD-10]]. For example:<ref name=\"isbn0-697-26071-2\">{{cite book |author1=Janovy, John |author2=Schmidt, Gerald D. |author3=Roberts, Larry S. |title=Gerald D. Schmidt & Larry S.

Thus the myiasis is described as either:<ref name=\"isbn0-697-26071-2\"/>\n** [[Obligate parasite|obligatory]], where the parasite cannot complete its life cycle without its parasitic phase, which may be specific, semispecific, or opportunistic \n** [[Facultative parasite|facultative]], incidental, or accidental, where it is not essential to the life cycle of the parasite; perhaps a normally free-living larva accidentally gained entrance to the host<ref name=\"John 2006. p. 328-334\"/> \nAccidental myiasis commonly is enteric, resulting from swallowing eggs or larvae with one's food.  The effect is called ''pseudomyiasis''.<ref>{{cite book |last=Zumpt |first=Fritz Konrad Ernst |title=Myiasis in man and animals in the old world |publisher=Butterworth |date=1965}}</ref> One traditional cause of pseudomyiasis was the eating of maggots of [[Piophilidae|cheese flies]] in cheeses such as [[Stilton cheese|Stilton]]. Depending on the species present in the gut, pseudomyiasis may cause significant medical symptoms, but it is likely that most cases pass unnoticed.\n\n==Prevention==\nThe first control method is preventive and aims to eradicate the adult flies before they can cause any damage and is called [[vector control]]. The second control method is the  treatment once the infestation is present, and concerns the infected animals (including humans).\n\nThe principal control method of adult populations of myiasis inducing flies involves [[insecticide]] applications in the environment where the target livestock is kept. [[Insecticide|Organophosphorus]] or [[Insecticide|organochlorine]] compounds may be used, usually in a spraying formulation. One alternative prevention method is the [[sterile insect technique]] (SIT) where a significant number of artificially reared sterilized (usually through irradiation) male flies  are introduced. The male flies compete with wild breed males for females in order to copulate and thus cause females to lay batches of unfertilized eggs which cannot develop into the larval stage.\n\nOne prevention method involves removing the environment most favourable to the flies, such as by removal of the tail. Another example is the [[crutching]] of sheep, which involves the removal of wool from around the tail and between the rear legs, which is a favourable environment for the larvae. Another, more permanent, practice which is used in some countries is [[mulesing]], where skin is removed from young animals to tighten remaining skin \u2013 leaving it less prone to fly attack.<ref name = \"DPI SOP\">{{cite web|url = http://www.agric.nsw.gov.au/reader/aw-sheep/13-mulesing.htm|publisher = New South Wales Department of Primary Industries |date = March 8, 2004|accessdate = 2007-01-09|title = Standard Operating Procedures - sheep Mulesing|work = teacher's notes}}</ref>\n\nTo prevent myiasis in humans, there is a need for general improvement of sanitation, personal hygiene, and extermination of the flies by insecticides. Clothes should be washed thoroughly, preferably in hot water, dried away from flies, and ironed thoroughly. The heat of the iron kills the eggs of myiasis-causing flies.<ref name=\"Adisa 2004\"/>\n\n==Treatment==\nThis applies once an infestation is established. In many circles the first response to cutaneous myiasis once the breathing hole has formed, is to cover the air hole thickly with petroleum jelly. Lack of oxygen then forces the larva to the surface, where it can more easily be dealt with. In a clinical or veterinary setting there may not be time for such tentative approaches, and the treatment of choice might be more direct, with or without an incision. First the larva must be eliminated through pressure around the lesion and the use of forceps. Secondly the wound must be cleaned and disinfected. Further control is necessary to avoid further reinfestation.\n\nLivestock may be treated prophylactically with slow release [[Bolus (medicine)|bolus]]es containing [[ivermectin]] which can provide long-term protection against the development of the larvae.\n\nSheep also may be [[sheep dip|dipped]], a process which involves drenching the animals in persistent insecticide to poison the larvae before they develop into a problem.\n\n==Epidemiology==\nThe most common infected animal worldwide is the domestic [[sheep]], for more information see [[fly strike in sheep]]. This condition is caused by the [[Calliphoridae|blowfly]] (particularly ''[[Common green bottle fly|Lucilia sericata]]'' and its sister species ''[[Lucilia cuprina|L. cuprina]]''), especially where the weather is often hot and wet.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=2007-05-12|title=Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies|journal=Veterinary Record|volume=160|issue=19|pages=669|doi=10.1136/vr.160.19.669-b|issn=0042-4900}}</ref> Blowfly strike accounts for over [[Australian dollar|A$]]170 million a year in losses in the [[Australia]]n sheep industry, the largest such losses in the world. Given the seriousness of the risk, Australian sheep farmers commonly perform preventive measures such as [[mulesing]] designed to remove the most common targets for the flies. The [[Docking (animal)|docking]] of lambs' tails (another frequently-soiled area that flies target) is also commonly practiced by sheep farmers worldwide.

In the American Civil War, army surgeons treated wounds by allowing blowfly maggots to clean away the decayed tissue.\n\nWilliam Baer, an orthopedic surgeon at Johns Hopkins during the late 1920s, used maggot therapy to treat a series of patients with osteomyelitis, an infection of bone or bone marrow. The idea was based on an experience in [[World War I]] in which two soldiers presented to him with broken femurs after having lain on the ground for seven days without food and water. Baer could not figure out why neither man had a fever or signs of sepsis. He observed: \u201cOn removing the clothing from the wounded part, much was my surprise to see the wound filled with thousands and thousands of maggots, apparently those of the blow fly. The sight was very disgusting and measures were taken hurriedly to wash out these abominable looking creatures.\u201d However, he then saw that the wounds were filled with \u201cbeautiful pink granulation tissue\u201d and were healing well.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Baer |first=William S. |date=1931 |title=The treatment of chronic osteomyelitis with the maggot (larva of the blow fly) |journal=Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery |volume=13 |issue=3 |pages=438\u2013475 |url=http://jbjs.org/content/13/3/438}}</ref>\n\nMaggot therapy was common in the United States during the 1930s.

The female [[Fly|flies]] lay their eggs on the sheep in damp, protected areas of the body that are soaked with urine and feces, mainly the sheep's breech ([[buttocks]]). It takes approximately eight hours to a day for the eggs to hatch, depending on the conditions. Once hatched, the larvae then lacerate the skin with their mouthparts, causing open sores. Once the skin has been breached, the larvae then tunnel through the sores into the host's [[subcutaneous tissue]], causing deep and irritating [[lesion]]s highly subject to infection. After about the second day, [[bacteria]]l [[infection]] is likely and, if left untreated, causes [[bacteremia|bacterial bloodstream infections]] or [[sepsis]]. This leads to [[Anorexia (symptom)|anorexia]] and weakness and is generally fatal if untreated.\n\n===Human vectors===\nThere are three main [[Diptera|fly]] families causing economically important myiasis in livestock and also, occasionally, in humans:\n* [[Calliphoridae]] (blowflies)\n**Some examples include ''[[Calliphora vomitoria]]'' and ''Calliphora vicina'' \n* [[Oestridae]] ([[Botfly|botflies]])\n* [[Sarcophagidae]] (fleshflies) ''[[Sarcophaga barbata]]'' are usually found in dead and rotting meat and animal excrement, which are prime environments for them. This is because their larvae are facultative [[parasites]], as they feed on organic tissue and use the hosts' oxygen reserve.\n\nOther families occasionally involved are:\n* [[Anisopodidae]]\n* [[Piophilidae]]\n* [[Stratiomyidae]]\n* [[Syrphidae]]\n\n====Specific myiasis====\nCaused by flies that need a host for larval development\n* ''[[Dermatobia hominis]]'' (human botfly)\n* ''[[Cordylobia anthropophaga]]'' (tumbu fly)\n* ''[[Oestrus ovis]]'' (sheep botfly)\n* ''[[Hypoderma (fly)|Hypoderma]]'' spp. (cattle botflies or ox warbles)\n* ''[[Gasterophilus]]'' spp. (horse botfly)\n* ''[[Cochliomyia hominivorax]]'' (new world screwworm fly)\n* ''[[Chrysomya bezziana]]'' (old world screwworm fly)\n* ''[[Auchmeromyia senegalensis]]'' (Congo floor maggot)\n* ''[[Cuterebra]]'' spp. (rodent and rabbit botfly)\n\n====Semispecific myiasis====\nCaused by flies that usually lay their eggs in decaying animal or vegetable matter, but that can develop in a host if open wounds or sores are present\n*''[[Lucilia (fly)|Lucilia]]'' spp. (green-bottle fly)\n*''[[Cochliomyia]]'' spp. (screw-worm fly)\n*''[[Phormia]]'' spp. (black-bottle fly)\n*''[[Calliphora]]'' spp. (blue-bottle fly)\n*''[[Sarcophaga]]'' spp. (flesh fly or sarcophagids)\n\nFlesh flies, or ''sarcophagids'', members of the family ''Sarcophagidae'', can cause [[Intestine|intestinal]] myiasis in humans if the females lay their eggs on meat or fruit.\n\n====Accidental myiasis====\nAlso called pseudomyiasis. Caused by flies that have no preference or need to develop in a host but that will do so on rare occasions.

They may also be ingested or enter through other body apertures.\n\n== Diagnosis ==\nMyiasis is often misdiagnosed in the United States because it is rare and its symptoms are not specific. Intestinal myiasis and urinary myiasis are especially difficult to diagnose.<ref name=\"John 2006. p. 328-334\"/>\n\nClues that myiasis may be present include recent travel to an endemic area, one or more non-healing lesions on the skin, itchiness, movement under the skin or pain, discharge from a central punctum (tiny hole), or a small, white structure protruding from the lesion.<ref name=\"Adisa 2004\">{{cite journal |last1=Adisa |first1=Charles Adeyinka |last2=Mbanaso |first2=Augustus |date=2004 |title=Furuncular myiasis of the breast caused by the larvae of the Tumbu fly (''Cordylobia anthropophaga'') |journal=BMC Surgery |volume=4 |page=5 |doi=10.1186/1471-2482-4-5 |pmc=394335 |pmid=15113429}}</ref> Serologic testing has also been used to diagnose the presence of botfly larvae in human ophthalmomyiasis.<ref name=lag/>\n\n<gallery>\nFile:UOTW 22 - Ultrasound of the Week 1.webm|Ultrasound showing maggot infestation<ref name=\"UOTW22\">{{cite web|title=UOTW #22 - Ultrasound of the Week|url=https://www.ultrasoundoftheweek.com/uotw-22/|website=Ultrasound of the Week|accessdate=27 May 2017|date=14 October 2014}}</ref>\nFile:UOTW 22 - Ultrasound of the Week 2.webm|Ultrasound showing maggot infestation<ref name=\"UOTW22\"/>\nFile:UOTW 22 - Ultrasound of the Week 3.jpg|Ultrasound showing maggot infestation<ref name=\"UOTW22\"/>\n</gallery>\n\n===Classifications===\n[[Germany|German]] [[Entomology|entomologist]] [[Fritz Konrad Ernst Zumpt|Fritz Zumpt]] describes myiasis as \"the infestation of live human and vertebrate animals with dipterous larvae, which at least for a period, feed on the host's dead or living tissue, liquid body substances, or ingested food\". For modern purposes however, this is too vague. For example, feeding on dead or necrotic tissue is not generally a problem except when larvae such as those of [[Cheese fly|flies in the family Piophilidae]] attack stored food such as cheese or preserved meats; such activity suggests [[Saprotrophic nutrition|saprophagy]] rather than parasitism; it even may be medically beneficial in [[Maggot therapy|maggot debridement therapy (MDT)]].\n\nCurrently myiasis commonly is classified according to aspects relevant to the case in question:\n* The classical description of myiasis is according to the part of the host that is infected. This is the classification used by [[ICD|ICD-10]]. For example:<ref name=\"isbn0-697-26071-2\">{{cite book |author1=Janovy, John |author2=Schmidt, Gerald D. |author3=Roberts, Larry S. |title=Gerald D. Schmidt & Larry S.

Thus the myiasis is described as either:<ref name=\"isbn0-697-26071-2\"/>\n** [[Obligate parasite|obligatory]], where the parasite cannot complete its life cycle without its parasitic phase, which may be specific, semispecific, or opportunistic \n** [[Facultative parasite|facultative]], incidental, or accidental, where it is not essential to the life cycle of the parasite; perhaps a normally free-living larva accidentally gained entrance to the host<ref name=\"John 2006. p. 328-334\"/> \nAccidental myiasis commonly is enteric, resulting from swallowing eggs or larvae with one's food.  The effect is called ''pseudomyiasis''.<ref>{{cite book |last=Zumpt |first=Fritz Konrad Ernst |title=Myiasis in man and animals in the old world |publisher=Butterworth |date=1965}}</ref> One traditional cause of pseudomyiasis was the eating of maggots of [[Piophilidae|cheese flies]] in cheeses such as [[Stilton cheese|Stilton]]. Depending on the species present in the gut, pseudomyiasis may cause significant medical symptoms, but it is likely that most cases pass unnoticed.\n\n==Prevention==\nThe first control method is preventive and aims to eradicate the adult flies before they can cause any damage and is called [[vector control]]. The second control method is the  treatment once the infestation is present, and concerns the infected animals (including humans).\n\nThe principal control method of adult populations of myiasis inducing flies involves [[insecticide]] applications in the environment where the target livestock is kept. [[Insecticide|Organophosphorus]] or [[Insecticide|organochlorine]] compounds may be used, usually in a spraying formulation. One alternative prevention method is the [[sterile insect technique]] (SIT) where a significant number of artificially reared sterilized (usually through irradiation) male flies  are introduced. The male flies compete with wild breed males for females in order to copulate and thus cause females to lay batches of unfertilized eggs which cannot develop into the larval stage.\n\nOne prevention method involves removing the environment most favourable to the flies, such as by removal of the tail. Another example is the [[crutching]] of sheep, which involves the removal of wool from around the tail and between the rear legs, which is a favourable environment for the larvae. Another, more permanent, practice which is used in some countries is [[mulesing]], where skin is removed from young animals to tighten remaining skin \u2013 leaving it less prone to fly attack.<ref name = \"DPI SOP\">{{cite web|url = http://www.agric.nsw.gov.au/reader/aw-sheep/13-mulesing.htm|publisher = New South Wales Department of Primary Industries |date = March 8, 2004|accessdate = 2007-01-09|title = Standard Operating Procedures - sheep Mulesing|work = teacher's notes}}</ref>\n\nTo prevent myiasis in humans, there is a need for general improvement of sanitation, personal hygiene, and extermination of the flies by insecticides. Clothes should be washed thoroughly, preferably in hot water, dried away from flies, and ironed thoroughly. The heat of the iron kills the eggs of myiasis-causing flies.<ref name=\"Adisa 2004\"/>\n\n==Treatment==\nThis applies once an infestation is established. In many circles the first response to cutaneous myiasis once the breathing hole has formed, is to cover the air hole thickly with petroleum jelly. Lack of oxygen then forces the larva to the surface, where it can more easily be dealt with. In a clinical or veterinary setting there may not be time for such tentative approaches, and the treatment of choice might be more direct, with or without an incision. First the larva must be eliminated through pressure around the lesion and the use of forceps. Secondly the wound must be cleaned and disinfected. Further control is necessary to avoid further reinfestation.\n\nLivestock may be treated prophylactically with slow release [[Bolus (medicine)|bolus]]es containing [[ivermectin]] which can provide long-term protection against the development of the larvae.\n\nSheep also may be [[sheep dip|dipped]], a process which involves drenching the animals in persistent insecticide to poison the larvae before they develop into a problem.\n\n==Epidemiology==\nThe most common infected animal worldwide is the domestic [[sheep]], for more information see [[fly strike in sheep]]. This condition is caused by the [[Calliphoridae|blowfly]] (particularly ''[[Common green bottle fly|Lucilia sericata]]'' and its sister species ''[[Lucilia cuprina|L. cuprina]]''), especially where the weather is often hot and wet.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=2007-05-12|title=Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies|journal=Veterinary Record|volume=160|issue=19|pages=669|doi=10.1136/vr.160.19.669-b|issn=0042-4900}}</ref> Blowfly strike accounts for over [[Australian dollar|A$]]170 million a year in losses in the [[Australia]]n sheep industry, the largest such losses in the world. Given the seriousness of the risk, Australian sheep farmers commonly perform preventive measures such as [[mulesing]] designed to remove the most common targets for the flies. The [[Docking (animal)|docking]] of lambs' tails (another frequently-soiled area that flies target) is also commonly practiced by sheep farmers worldwide.

This is an important distinction, as most other major varieties of myiasitic fly larvae attack both live and dead wound tissue indiscriminately, effectively negating their benefit in non-harmful wound debridement. Medicinal maggots are placed on the wound and covered with a sterile dressing of gauze and nylon mesh. However, too many larvae placed on the wound could result in healthy tissue being eaten, efficiently creating a new wound, rendering it as a type of myiasis. <ref name=\"Sherman, RA 2000\"/>\n\n===History===\nMaggot therapy has a long history and [[prehistory]]. The indigenous people of Australia used maggot therapy, and so do the Hill Peoples of Northern Burma, and possibly the Mayans of Central America.<ref name=\"John 2006. p. 328-334\"/> Surgeons in Napoleon's armies recognized that wounded soldiers with myiasis were more likely to survive than those without the infestation. In the American Civil War, army surgeons treated wounds by allowing blowfly maggots to clean away the decayed tissue.\n\nWilliam Baer, an orthopedic surgeon at Johns Hopkins during the late 1920s, used maggot therapy to treat a series of patients with osteomyelitis, an infection of bone or bone marrow. The idea was based on an experience in [[World War I]] in which two soldiers presented to him with broken femurs after having lain on the ground for seven days without food and water. Baer could not figure out why neither man had a fever or signs of sepsis. He observed: \u201cOn removing the clothing from the wounded part, much was my surprise to see the wound filled with thousands and thousands of maggots, apparently those of the blow fly. The sight was very disgusting and measures were taken hurriedly to wash out these abominable looking creatures.\u201d However, he then saw that the wounds were filled with \u201cbeautiful pink granulation tissue\u201d and were healing well.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Baer |first=William S. |date=1931 |title=The treatment of chronic osteomyelitis with the maggot (larva of the blow fly) |journal=Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery |volume=13 |issue=3 |pages=438\u2013475 |url=http://jbjs.org/content/13/3/438}}</ref>\n\nMaggot therapy was common in the United States during the 1930s.

Because power output for variable renewable sources is unpredictable, however, using nameplate capacity as a metric significantly overstates a source's average generation. Thus, capacity is typically multiplied by a suitable [[capacity factor]], which takes into account varying conditions - weather, nighttime, latitude, maintenance, etc. to give energy planners an idea of a source's value to the public. In addition, depending on context, the stated peak power may be prior to a subsequent conversion to [[alternating current]], e.g. for a single photovoltaic panel, or include this conversion and its loss for a grid connected [[photovoltaic power station]].<ref name=\"epia-2014\" />{{rp|15}}<ref name=\"iea-pvps-snapshot-1992-2013\" />{{rp|10}} Worldwide, the average solar PV capacity factor is 11%.<ref name=\"eia-cf\" />\n\n[[Wind power]] has different characteristics, e.g. a higher [[capacity factor]] and about four times the 2015 electricity production of solar power.

In the 1980s and early 1990s, most photovoltaic modules were used in [[stand-alone power system]]s or powered consumer products such as [[Solar-powered watch|watches]], [[Solar-powered calculator|calculators]] and toys, but from around 1995, industry efforts have focused increasingly on developing grid-connected [[rooftop PV system]]s and [[Photovoltaic power station|power stations]]. By 1996, solar PV capacity in the US amounted to 77&nbsp;megawatts\u2013more than any other country in the world at the time. Then, Japan moved ahead.\n\n=== Japan (1997\u20132004) ===\n\n[[Solar power in Japan|Japan]] took the lead as the world's largest producer of PV electricity, after the city of Kobe was hit by the [[Great Hanshin earthquake]] in 1995. Kobe experienced severe power outages in the aftermath of the earthquake, and [[PV systems]] were then considered as a temporary supplier of power during such events, as the disruption of the [[electric grid]] paralyzed the entire infrastructure, including gas stations that depended on electricity to pump gasoline. Moreover, in December of that same year, an accident occurred at the multibillion-dollar experimental [[Monju Nuclear Power Plant]]. A sodium leak caused a major fire and forced a shutdown (classified as [[International Nuclear Event Scale|INES]] 1). There was massive public outrage when it was revealed that the semigovernmental agency in charge of Monju had tried to cover up the extent of the accident and resulting damage.<ref>{{cite news| title=REACTOR ACCIDENT IN JAPAN IMPERILS ENERGY PROGRAM| first=Andrew | last=Pollack | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/24/world/reactor-accident-in-japan-imperils-energy-program.html| work=New York Times| date=24 February 1996}}</ref><ref>wise-paris.org [http://www.wise-paris.org/index.html?/english/ournewsletter/2/page7.html&/english/frame/menu.html&/english/frame/band.html Sodium Leak and Fire at Monju]</ref> Japan remained world leader in photovoltaics until 2004, when its capacity amounted to 1,132&nbsp;megawatts. Then, focus on PV deployment shifted to Europe.\n\n=== Germany (2005\u20132014) ===\n\nIn 2005, [[Solar power in Germany|Germany]] took the lead from Japan. With the introduction of the [[German Renewable Energy Act|Renewable Energy Act]] in 2000, [[feed-in tariffs]] were adopted as a policy mechanism. This policy established that renewables have priority on the grid, and that a fixed price must be paid for the produced electricity over a 20-year period, providing a guaranteed return on investment irrespective of actual market prices. As a consequence, a high level of investment security lead to a soaring number of new photovoltaic installations that peaked in 2011, while investment costs in renewable technologies were brought down considerably. In 2016 Germany's installed PV capacity was over the 40&nbsp;GW mark.\n\n=== China (2015\u2013present) ===\n\nChina surpassed Germany's capacity by the end of 2015, becoming the world's largest producer of photovoltaic power.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://cleantechnica.com/2016/01/22/china-overtakes-germany-become-worlds-leading-solar-pv-country/|title= China Overtakes Germany To Become World's Leading Solar PV Country|first= Joshua|last=S Hill |date= January 22, 2016|accessdate= August 16, 2016|work= Clean Technica}}</ref> [[Solar power in China|China]]'s rapid PV growth continued in 2016 \u2013 with 34.2&nbsp;GW of solar photovoltaics installed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.solarserver.com/solar-magazine/solar-news/current/2017/kw03/nea-china-added-3424-gw-of-solar-pv-capacity-in-2016.html|title=NEA: China added 34.24 GW of solar PV capacity in 2016|last=|first=|date=|website=solarserver.com|language=en|access-date=2017-01-22}}</ref> The quickly lowering feed in tariff rates<ref>https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-renewables-tariffs-idUSKBN0U703Y20151224</ref> at the end of 2015 motivated many developers to secure tariff rates before mid-year 2016 \u2013 as they were anticipating further cuts (correctly so<ref>http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/articles/2016/10/china-to-lower-feed-in-tariff-cut-subsidies-for-solar-pv-systems.html</ref>).

In addition, the demand for silicon from semiconductor manufacturers was growing. Since the amount of silicon needed for semiconductors makes up a much smaller portion of production costs, semiconductor manufacturers were able to outbid solar companies for the available silicon in the market.<ref>Wired.com [http://archive.wired.com/science/planetearth/news/2005/03/67013 Silicon Shortage Stalls Solar] 28 March 2005</ref>\n\nInitially, the incumbent polysilicon producers were slow to respond to rising demand for solar \napplications, because of their painful experience with over-investment in the past. Silicon prices sharply rose to about $80 per kilogram, and reached as much as $400/kg for long-term contracts and spot prices. In 2007, the constraints on silicon became so severe that the solar industry was forced to idle about a quarter of its cell and module manufacturing capacity\u2014an estimated 777&nbsp;MW of the then available production capacity. The shortage also provided silicon specialists with both the cash and an incentive to develop new technologies and several new producers entered the market. Early responses from the solar industry focused on improvements in the recycling of silicon. When this potential was exhausted, companies have been taking a harder look at alternatives to the conventional [[Siemens process]].<ref>\n{{cite web\n |title=Solar State of the Market Q3 2008 \u2013 Rise of Upgraded Metallurgical Silicon\n |url=http://www.solarweb.net/forosolar/attachments/aspectos-economicos-legales-administrativos/937d1241049999-verdadero-coste-la-energia-solar-espana-lux_research_rise_of_upgraded_metallurgical_silicon.pdf\n |website=SolarWeb\n |publisher= Lux Research Inc.\n |page=1\n |accessdate=12 October 2014\n |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6TFljtiw4\n |archivedate=12 October 2014\n |url-status=dead\n}}</ref>\n\nAs it takes about three years to build a new polysilicon plant, the shortage continued until 2008. Prices for conventional solar cells remained constant or even rose slightly during the period of silicon shortage from 2005 to 2008. This is notably seen as a \"shoulder\" that sticks out in the [[commons:File:Swansons-law.png|Swanson's PV-learning curve]] and it was feared that a prolonged shortage could delay solar power becoming competitive with conventional energy prices without subsidies.\n\nIn the meantime the solar industry lowered the number of grams-per-watt by reducing wafer thickness and kerf loss, increasing yields in each manufacturing step, reducing module loss, and raising panel efficiency. Finally, the ramp up of polysilicon production alleviated worldwide markets from the scarcity of silicon in 2009 and subsequently lead to an overcapacity with sharply declining prices in the photovoltaic industry for the following years.\n\n=== Solar overcapacity (2009\u20132013) ===\n{{thumb\n| width = 280\n|content=\n{{center|'''Solar module production'''}}\n{{center|style=font-size: 0.85em;|'''utilization of production capacity in %'''}}\n{{Graph:Chart\n| width = 220\n| height = 200\n| xAxisAngle = -40\n| x = 1993, 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013\n| yAxisMax = 1\n| yAxisMin = 0\n| yAxisFormat = %\n| y = .65, , .56, , .50, .50, .48, .60, .61, .64, .70, .73, .61, .71, .49, .52, .52, .57, .65, .58, .63\n| showSymbols = \n}}\n|caption = Utilization rate of [[solar PV module]] production capacity in % since 1993<ref name=\"iea-pvps-trends-2014\" />{{rp|47}}\n}}\n\nAs the [[Polycrystalline silicon#Manufacturers|polysilicon]] industry had started to build additional large production capacities during the shortage period, prices dropped as low as $15 per kilogram forcing some producers to suspend production or exit the sector. Prices for silicon stabilized around $20 per kilogram and the booming solar PV market helped to reduce the enormous global overcapacity from 2009 onwards. However, overcapacity in the PV industry continued to persist. In 2013, global record deployment of 38&nbsp;GW (updated EPIA figure<ref name=\"epia-2014\" />) was still much lower than China's annual production capacity of approximately 60&nbsp;GW. Continued overcapacity was further reduced by significantly lowering [[solar module]] prices and, as a consequence, many manufacturers could no longer cover costs or remain competitive. As worldwide growth of PV deployment continued, the gap between overcapacity and global demand was expected in 2014 to close in the next few years.<ref>\n{{cite web\n |title=Annual Report 2013/2014\n |url=http://www.ise.fraunhofer.de/en/publications/veroeffentlichungen-pdf-dateien-en/infomaterial/annual-reports/fraunhofer-ise-annual-report-2013-14.pdf\n |website=ISE.Fraunhofer.de\n |publisher=Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems-ISE\n |accessdate=5 November 2014\n |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6TrDlHLYv\n |archivedate=5 November 2014\n |page=1\n |date=2014\n |url-status=live\n}}</ref>\n\nIEA-PVPS published in 2014 historical data for the worldwide utilization of solar PV module production capacity that showed a slow return to normalization in manufacture in the years leading up to 2014.

For several years, growth was mainly driven by Japan and pioneering European countries. As a consequence, cost of solar declined significantly due to [[experience curve effects]] like improvements in technology and [[economies of scale]]. Several national programs were instrumental in increasing PV deployment, such as the [[Energiewende]] in Germany, the [[Million Solar Roofs]] project in the United States, and China's 2011 five-year-plan for energy production.<ref name=\"guardian-china\">{{cite web |last1=Lacey |first1=Stephen |title=How China dominates solar power |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/sep/12/how-china-dominates-solar-power |work=Guardian Environment Network |accessdate=29 June 2014 |date=12 September 2011}}</ref> Since then, deployment of photovoltaics has gained momentum on a worldwide scale, increasingly competing with [[conventional energy]] sources.

Because power output for variable renewable sources is unpredictable, however, using nameplate capacity as a metric significantly overstates a source's average generation. Thus, capacity is typically multiplied by a suitable [[capacity factor]], which takes into account varying conditions - weather, nighttime, latitude, maintenance, etc. to give energy planners an idea of a source's value to the public. In addition, depending on context, the stated peak power may be prior to a subsequent conversion to [[alternating current]], e.g. for a single photovoltaic panel, or include this conversion and its loss for a grid connected [[photovoltaic power station]].<ref name=\"epia-2014\" />{{rp|15}}<ref name=\"iea-pvps-snapshot-1992-2013\" />{{rp|10}} Worldwide, the average solar PV capacity factor is 11%.<ref name=\"eia-cf\" />\n\n[[Wind power]] has different characteristics, e.g. a higher [[capacity factor]] and about four times the 2015 electricity production of solar power.

In the 1980s and early 1990s, most photovoltaic modules were used in [[stand-alone power system]]s or powered consumer products such as [[Solar-powered watch|watches]], [[Solar-powered calculator|calculators]] and toys, but from around 1995, industry efforts have focused increasingly on developing grid-connected [[rooftop PV system]]s and [[Photovoltaic power station|power stations]]. By 1996, solar PV capacity in the US amounted to 77&nbsp;megawatts\u2013more than any other country in the world at the time. Then, Japan moved ahead.\n\n=== Japan (1997\u20132004) ===\n\n[[Solar power in Japan|Japan]] took the lead as the world's largest producer of PV electricity, after the city of Kobe was hit by the [[Great Hanshin earthquake]] in 1995. Kobe experienced severe power outages in the aftermath of the earthquake, and [[PV systems]] were then considered as a temporary supplier of power during such events, as the disruption of the [[electric grid]] paralyzed the entire infrastructure, including gas stations that depended on electricity to pump gasoline. Moreover, in December of that same year, an accident occurred at the multibillion-dollar experimental [[Monju Nuclear Power Plant]]. A sodium leak caused a major fire and forced a shutdown (classified as [[International Nuclear Event Scale|INES]] 1). There was massive public outrage when it was revealed that the semigovernmental agency in charge of Monju had tried to cover up the extent of the accident and resulting damage.<ref>{{cite news| title=REACTOR ACCIDENT IN JAPAN IMPERILS ENERGY PROGRAM| first=Andrew | last=Pollack | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/24/world/reactor-accident-in-japan-imperils-energy-program.html| work=New York Times| date=24 February 1996}}</ref><ref>wise-paris.org [http://www.wise-paris.org/index.html?/english/ournewsletter/2/page7.html&/english/frame/menu.html&/english/frame/band.html Sodium Leak and Fire at Monju]</ref> Japan remained world leader in photovoltaics until 2004, when its capacity amounted to 1,132&nbsp;megawatts. Then, focus on PV deployment shifted to Europe.\n\n=== Germany (2005\u20132014) ===\n\nIn 2005, [[Solar power in Germany|Germany]] took the lead from Japan. With the introduction of the [[German Renewable Energy Act|Renewable Energy Act]] in 2000, [[feed-in tariffs]] were adopted as a policy mechanism. This policy established that renewables have priority on the grid, and that a fixed price must be paid for the produced electricity over a 20-year period, providing a guaranteed return on investment irrespective of actual market prices. As a consequence, a high level of investment security lead to a soaring number of new photovoltaic installations that peaked in 2011, while investment costs in renewable technologies were brought down considerably. In 2016 Germany's installed PV capacity was over the 40&nbsp;GW mark.\n\n=== China (2015\u2013present) ===\n\nChina surpassed Germany's capacity by the end of 2015, becoming the world's largest producer of photovoltaic power.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://cleantechnica.com/2016/01/22/china-overtakes-germany-become-worlds-leading-solar-pv-country/|title= China Overtakes Germany To Become World's Leading Solar PV Country|first= Joshua|last=S Hill |date= January 22, 2016|accessdate= August 16, 2016|work= Clean Technica}}</ref> [[Solar power in China|China]]'s rapid PV growth continued in 2016 \u2013 with 34.2&nbsp;GW of solar photovoltaics installed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.solarserver.com/solar-magazine/solar-news/current/2017/kw03/nea-china-added-3424-gw-of-solar-pv-capacity-in-2016.html|title=NEA: China added 34.24 GW of solar PV capacity in 2016|last=|first=|date=|website=solarserver.com|language=en|access-date=2017-01-22}}</ref> The quickly lowering feed in tariff rates<ref>https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-renewables-tariffs-idUSKBN0U703Y20151224</ref> at the end of 2015 motivated many developers to secure tariff rates before mid-year 2016 \u2013 as they were anticipating further cuts (correctly so<ref>http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/articles/2016/10/china-to-lower-feed-in-tariff-cut-subsidies-for-solar-pv-systems.html</ref>).

In addition, the demand for silicon from semiconductor manufacturers was growing. Since the amount of silicon needed for semiconductors makes up a much smaller portion of production costs, semiconductor manufacturers were able to outbid solar companies for the available silicon in the market.<ref>Wired.com [http://archive.wired.com/science/planetearth/news/2005/03/67013 Silicon Shortage Stalls Solar] 28 March 2005</ref>\n\nInitially, the incumbent polysilicon producers were slow to respond to rising demand for solar \napplications, because of their painful experience with over-investment in the past. Silicon prices sharply rose to about $80 per kilogram, and reached as much as $400/kg for long-term contracts and spot prices. In 2007, the constraints on silicon became so severe that the solar industry was forced to idle about a quarter of its cell and module manufacturing capacity\u2014an estimated 777&nbsp;MW of the then available production capacity. The shortage also provided silicon specialists with both the cash and an incentive to develop new technologies and several new producers entered the market. Early responses from the solar industry focused on improvements in the recycling of silicon. When this potential was exhausted, companies have been taking a harder look at alternatives to the conventional [[Siemens process]].<ref>\n{{cite web\n |title=Solar State of the Market Q3 2008 \u2013 Rise of Upgraded Metallurgical Silicon\n |url=http://www.solarweb.net/forosolar/attachments/aspectos-economicos-legales-administrativos/937d1241049999-verdadero-coste-la-energia-solar-espana-lux_research_rise_of_upgraded_metallurgical_silicon.pdf\n |website=SolarWeb\n |publisher= Lux Research Inc.\n |page=1\n |accessdate=12 October 2014\n |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6TFljtiw4\n |archivedate=12 October 2014\n |url-status=dead\n}}</ref>\n\nAs it takes about three years to build a new polysilicon plant, the shortage continued until 2008. Prices for conventional solar cells remained constant or even rose slightly during the period of silicon shortage from 2005 to 2008. This is notably seen as a \"shoulder\" that sticks out in the [[commons:File:Swansons-law.png|Swanson's PV-learning curve]] and it was feared that a prolonged shortage could delay solar power becoming competitive with conventional energy prices without subsidies.\n\nIn the meantime the solar industry lowered the number of grams-per-watt by reducing wafer thickness and kerf loss, increasing yields in each manufacturing step, reducing module loss, and raising panel efficiency. Finally, the ramp up of polysilicon production alleviated worldwide markets from the scarcity of silicon in 2009 and subsequently lead to an overcapacity with sharply declining prices in the photovoltaic industry for the following years.\n\n=== Solar overcapacity (2009\u20132013) ===\n{{thumb\n| width = 280\n|content=\n{{center|'''Solar module production'''}}\n{{center|style=font-size: 0.85em;|'''utilization of production capacity in %'''}}\n{{Graph:Chart\n| width = 220\n| height = 200\n| xAxisAngle = -40\n| x = 1993, 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013\n| yAxisMax = 1\n| yAxisMin = 0\n| yAxisFormat = %\n| y = .65, , .56, , .50, .50, .48, .60, .61, .64, .70, .73, .61, .71, .49, .52, .52, .57, .65, .58, .63\n| showSymbols = \n}}\n|caption = Utilization rate of [[solar PV module]] production capacity in % since 1993<ref name=\"iea-pvps-trends-2014\" />{{rp|47}}\n}}\n\nAs the [[Polycrystalline silicon#Manufacturers|polysilicon]] industry had started to build additional large production capacities during the shortage period, prices dropped as low as $15 per kilogram forcing some producers to suspend production or exit the sector. Prices for silicon stabilized around $20 per kilogram and the booming solar PV market helped to reduce the enormous global overcapacity from 2009 onwards. However, overcapacity in the PV industry continued to persist. In 2013, global record deployment of 38&nbsp;GW (updated EPIA figure<ref name=\"epia-2014\" />) was still much lower than China's annual production capacity of approximately 60&nbsp;GW. Continued overcapacity was further reduced by significantly lowering [[solar module]] prices and, as a consequence, many manufacturers could no longer cover costs or remain competitive. As worldwide growth of PV deployment continued, the gap between overcapacity and global demand was expected in 2014 to close in the next few years.<ref>\n{{cite web\n |title=Annual Report 2013/2014\n |url=http://www.ise.fraunhofer.de/en/publications/veroeffentlichungen-pdf-dateien-en/infomaterial/annual-reports/fraunhofer-ise-annual-report-2013-14.pdf\n |website=ISE.Fraunhofer.de\n |publisher=Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems-ISE\n |accessdate=5 November 2014\n |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6TrDlHLYv\n |archivedate=5 November 2014\n |page=1\n |date=2014\n |url-status=live\n}}</ref>\n\nIEA-PVPS published in 2014 historical data for the worldwide utilization of solar PV module production capacity that showed a slow return to normalization in manufacture in the years leading up to 2014.
