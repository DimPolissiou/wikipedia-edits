It was adapted from [[Dorothy Heyward]] and DuBose Heyward's play ''[[Porgy (play)|Porgy]]'', itself an adaptation of DuBose Heyward's [[Porgy (novel)|1925 novel]] of the same name.\n\n''Porgy and Bess'' was first performed in Boston on September 30, 1935, before it moved to [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in New York City.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SUsgBQAAQBAJ&lpg=PA102|title=Poitier Revisited: Reconsidering a Black Icon in the Obama Age|last=Strachan|first=Ian Gregory|last2=Mask|first2=Mia|date=2014-11-27|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing USA|isbn=9781623562977|location=|pages=102|language=en}}</ref> It featured a cast of classically trained African-American singers\u2014a daring artistic choice at the time. After an initially unpopular public reception, a 1976 [[Porgy and Bess#1976 Houston Grand Opera production|Houston Grand Opera]] production gained it new popularity, and it is now one of the best-known and most frequently performed operas.\n\nThe libretto of ''Porgy and Bess'' tells the story of Porgy, a disabled black street-beggar living in the slums of Charleston. It deals with his attempts to rescue Bess from the clutches of Crown, her violent and possessive lover, and Sportin' Life, her drug dealer. The opera plot generally follows the stage play.\n\nIn the years following Gershwin's death, ''Porgy and Bess'' was adapted for smaller scale performances. It was [[Porgy and Bess (film)|adapted as a film]] in 1959. Some of the songs in the opera, such as \"[[Summertime (George Gershwin song)|Summertime]]\", became popular and are frequently recorded.\n\nIn the late 20th and early 21st centuries, the trend has been toward productions with greater fidelity to Gershwin's original intentions. Smaller-scale productions also continue to be mounted. A complete recorded version of the score was released in 1976; since then, it has been recorded several times.\n\n==Inception==\nThe origin of ''Porgy and Bess'' is DuBose Heyward's 1925 novel [[Porgy (novel)|''Porgy'']]. Heyward produced a [[Porgy (play)|play by the same name]] with [[Dorothy Heyward]].\n\nGeorge Gershwin read ''Porgy'' in 1926 and proposed to Heyward to collaborate on an operatic version. In 1934, Gershwin and Heyward began work on the project by visiting the author's native [[Charleston, South Carolina]]. In a 1935 ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' article, Gershwin explained his motivation for calling ''Porgy and Bess'' a folk opera:\n<blockquote>Porgy and Bess is a folk tale. Its people naturally would sing folk music. When I first began work in the music I decided against the use of original folk material because I wanted the music to be all of one piece. Therefore I wrote my own spirituals and folksongs. But they are still folk music\u2014and therefore, being in operatic form, ''Porgy and Bess'' becomes a folk opera.<ref>{{cite news|last=Gershwin|first=George|title=Gershwin explains why his 'Porgy and Bess' is called 'folk opera'|newspaper=The New York Times|date=November 2, 1935}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n== Composition history ==\n{{Expand section|date=March 2015}}\n\nIn the fall of 1933 Gershwin and Heyward signed a contract with the Theatre Guild to write the opera. In the summer of 1934 Gershwin and Heyward went to [[Folly Beach, South Carolina]] (a small island near Charleston), where Gershwin got a feel for the locale and its music. He worked on the opera there and in New York. Ira Gershwin, in New York, wrote lyrics to some of the opera's classic songs, most notably \"It Ain't Necessarily So\". Most of the lyrics, including \"Summertime\", were written by Heyward, who also wrote the libretto.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.wfmt.com/offmic/2016/01/22/the-true-origins-of-gershwins-summertime/|title=The true origins of Gershwin's Summertime|accessdate=December 31, 2016|author=Stephen Raskauskas=2016}}</ref>\n\n== Performance history ==\n=== 1935 original Broadway production ===\n[[File:Ruby Elzy (1935).jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Ruby Elzy]] as Serena in the original Broadway production of ''Porgy and Bess'' (1935)]]\n[[File:John W.

He chose as his choral director [[Eva Jessye]], who also directed her own renowned choir. The world premiere performance took place at the [[Colonial Theatre (Boston)|Colonial Theatre]] in Boston on September 30, 1935\u2014the try-out for a work intended initially for Broadway where the opening took place at the [[Neil Simon Theatre|Alvin Theatre]] in New York City on October 10, 1935.{{sfn|Jablonski|Stewart|1973|pp=227\u2013229}} During rehearsals and in Boston, Gershwin made many cuts and refinements to shorten the running time and tighten the dramatic action. The run on Broadway lasted 124 performances. The production and direction were entrusted to [[Rouben Mamoulian]], who had previously directed the Broadway productions of Heyward's play ''Porgy''. The music director was [[Alexander Smallens]]. The leading roles were played by [[Todd Duncan]] and [[Anne Brown]]. {{citation needed-span|date=August 2019|text=Brown was a 20-year-old student at [[Juilliard]], the first African-American vocalist admitted there, when she read that George Gershwin was going to write a musical version of ''Porgy''.

Bubbles]] created the role of Sportin' Life; the role of Serena was created by [[Ruby Elzy]].\n\nAfter the Broadway run, a tour started on January 27, 1936, in Philadelphia and traveled to Pittsburgh and Chicago before ending in Washington, D.C., on March 21, 1936. During the Washington run, the cast\u2014as led by Todd Duncan\u2014protested [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregation]] at the [[National Theatre (Washington, D.C.)|National Theatre]]. Eventually management gave in to the demands, resulting in the first integrated audience for a performance of any show at that venue.<ref name=loc>[https://www.loc.gov/item/today-in-history/september-02/ ''Porgy and Bess''], ''American Memory'': \"Today in History, September 2\",'' Library of Congress</ref>\n\nIn 1938, much of the original cast reunited for a [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] revival that played in [[Los Angeles]] and at the [[Curran Theatre]] in [[San Francisco]]. [[Avon Long]] took on the role of Sportin' Life for the first time, a role he would continue to play in many productions over a long career.\n\n=== 1942 Broadway revival ===\nThe noted director and producer [[Cheryl Crawford]] produced professional stock theater in [[Maplewood, New Jersey]], for three very successful seasons. The last of these closed with ''Porgy and Bess'', which she co-produced with [[John Wildberg]]. In re-fashioning it in the style of [[musical theatre]] which Americans were used to hearing from Gershwin, Crawford produced a drastically cut version of the opera compared with the first Broadway staging. The orchestra was reduced, the cast was halved, and many [[recitative]]s were reduced to spoken dialog.<ref name=JS />\n\nHaving seen the performance, theater owner [[Lee Shubert]] arranged for Crawford to bring her production to Broadway. The show opened at the [[Majestic Theatre (Broadway)|Majestic Theatre]] in January 1942.<ref>''Victor Book of the Opera'' New York: Simon and Schuster, 1968, pp. 326\u2013328</ref> Duncan and Brown reprised their roles as the title characters, with Alexander Smallens again conducting. In June the contralto [[Etta Moten]], whom Gershwin had first envisioned as Bess, replaced Brown in the role. Moten was such a success that Bess became her signature role. The Crawford production ran for nine months and was far more successful financially than the original.\n\nRadio station [[WOR (AM)|WOR]] in New York broadcast a live one-hour version on May 7, 1942. The cast included Todd Duncan, Anne Brown, Ruby Elzy, [[Avon Long]], [[Edward Matthews (baritone)|Edward Matthews]], Harriet Jackson, Georgette Harvey, Jack Carr, and the Eva Jessye Choir; the WOR Symphony was conducted by [[Alfred Wallenstein]]. The 12&Prime;-diameter 78 rpm, glass base, lacquer-coated disks were transferred to open-reel tape on February 6, 1975.\n\n=== European premieres ===\nOn March 27, 1943, the opera had its European premiere at the [[Royal Danish Theatre]] in Copenhagen. Performed during the [[Nazism|Nazi]] occupation of the country, this performance was notable for being performed by an all-white cast made up in [[blackface]]. After 22 sold-out performances, the Nazis forced the theatre to close the production.<ref name=JS/> Other all-white or mostly-white productions in Europe, reflecting contemporary demographics in the countries, took place in [[Zurich]], Switzerland, in 1945 and 1950, and [[Gothenburg]] and [[Stockholm]], Sweden, in 1948.\n[[File:Leontyne Price-Porgy and Bess.jpg|thumb|upright|Leontyne Price as Bess]]\n\n=== 1952 touring production ===\n[[Blevins Davis]] and Robert Breen produced a revival in 1952 which restored much of the music cut in the Crawford version, including many of the recitatives. It divided the opera into two acts, with the intermission occurring after Crown forces Bess to stay on Kittiwah Island. This version restored the work to a more operatic form, though not all of the recitatives were retained. In this version, ''Porgy and Bess'' was warmly received throughout Europe.<ref name=loc />{{failed verification|date=February 2020|reason=Nothing about the 1952 version there.}} The London premiere took place on October 9, 1952, at the [[Stoll Theatre]] where the opera continued until February 10, 1953.<ref>Martin, George: ''The Opera Companion to Twentieth Century Opera'' New York: Dodd, Meade & Company, 1979. pp. 389\u2013396.</ref>\n\nThis production's original cast featured Americans [[Leontyne Price]] as Bess, [[William Warfield]] as Porgy, and [[Cab Calloway]] as Sportin' Life, a role that Gershwin had composed with him in mind. The role of Clara was played by a young [[Maya Angelou]]. Price and Warfield met and wed while on the tour. The role of Porgy was the first for Warfield after his appearance as Joe, singing \"[[Ol' Man River]]\" in the popular 1951 [[MGM]] [[Show Boat (1951 film)|film of ''Show Boat'']].\n\nAfter a tour of Europe financed by the [[United States Department of State]], the production came to Broadway's [[Ziegfeld Theatre (1927)|Ziegfeld Theatre]] in March 1953. It later toured North America. After completing its North American run in Montreal, the company embarked on an international tour, with LeVern Hutcherson as Porgy and [[Gloria Davy]] as Bess.

A historic yet tense premiere took place in Moscow in December 1955; it was during the [[Cold War]] and the first time an American theater group had been to the Soviet capital since the [[October Revolution|Bolshevik Revolution]]. Author [[Truman Capote]] traveled with the cast and crew, and wrote an account included in his book ''[[The Muses Are Heard]]''.\n\n=== 1976 Houston Grand Opera production ===\nDuring the 1960s and early 1970s, ''Porgy and Bess'' mostly languished on the shelves, a victim of its perceived racism. Though new productions took place in 1961 and 1964, along with a [[Vienna Volksoper]] premiere in 1965 (again with William Warfield as Porgy), these did little to change many African Americans' opinions of the work. Many music critics still had not accepted it as a true opera.\n\nA new staging of ''Porgy and Bess'' was produced by the [[Houston Grand Opera]] in 1976 under music director [[John DeMain]]; it restored the complete original score for the first time. Following its debut in Houston, the production opened on Broadway at the [[Uris Theatre]] on September 25, 1976 and was recorded complete by [[RCA Records]]. This version was very influential in turning the tide of opinion about the work.\n\nFor the first time, an American opera company, not a Broadway production company, had tackled the opera. This production was based on Gershwin's original full score. It did not incorporate the cuts and other changes which Gershwin had made before the New York premiere, nor the ones made for the 1942 Cheryl Crawford revival or the [[#1959 film|1959 film version]]. It allowed the public to take in the operatic whole as first envisioned by the composer. In this light, ''Porgy and Bess'' was accepted as an opera. [[Donnie Ray Albert]] and [[Robert Mosley]] alternated performances in the role of Porgy. [[Clamma Dale]] and [[Larry Marshall (actor)|Larry Marshall]] starred, respectively, as Bess and Sportin' Life. This production won the Houston Grand Opera a [[Tony Award]]\u2014the only opera ever to receive one\u2014and a [[Grammy Award]]. The conductor was John DeMain.\n\n===Subsequent productions===\nAnother Broadway production was staged in 1983 at [[Radio City Music Hall]] with conductor [[C. William Harwood]], based on the Houston production.<ref>{{cite web|author=The Broadway League |url=http://www.ibdb.com/production.php?id=4861 |title=''Porgy and Bess'' &#124; IBDB: The official source for Broadway Information |publisher=IBDB |date= |accessdate=February 4, 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Metropolitan Opera]] finally presented a production of ''Porgy and Bess'' in 1985 after considering it since the 1930s. It opened February 6, 1985 with a cast including [[Simon Estes]], [[Grace Bumbry]], [[Bruce Hubbard]], Gregg Baker and [[Florence Quivar]]. The Met production was directed by [[Nathaniel Merrill]] and designed by [[Robert O'Hearn]]. The conductor was [[James Levine]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metoperafamily.org/metopera/history/ |title=Met History |publisher=The Metropolitan Opera|date= |accessdate=February 4, 2010}}</ref> The production received 16 performances in its first season and was revived in 1986, 1989 and 1990, for a total of 54 performances. After an absence of nearly thirty years on the Met stage, the company staged the new 2018 London production conducted by [[David Robertson (conductor)|David Robertson]] in Fall 2019.<ref>https://www.metopera.org/season/2019-20-season/porgy-and-bess/</ref><ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/music/met-opera-offers-a-porgy-of-its-time-that-speaks-to-ours/2019/09/24/0c73c756-de8e-11e9-be96-6adb81821e90_story.html Washington Post, ''Met Opera offers a Porgy of its time that speaks to ours'']</ref> It featured a cast including Golda Schultz, [[Latonia Moore]], [[Angel Blue]], [[Elizabeth Llewellyn]], [[Denyce Graves]], [[Eric Owens (bass-baritone)|Eric Owens]], Frederick Ballentine, Alfred Walker, and [[Ryan Speedo Green]].\n\n[[Trevor Nunn]] first tackled the work in an acclaimed 1986 production at England's [[Glyndebourne Festival]]. The 1986 Trevor Nunn production was scenically expanded and videotaped for television in 1993 (see below in \"Television\"). These productions were also based on the \"complete score,\" without incorporating Gershwin's revisions. A semi-staged version of this production was performed at [[the Proms]] in 1998.\n\nThe centennial celebration of the Gershwin brothers from 1996 to 1998 included a new production as well. On February 24\u201325, 2006, the [[Nashville Symphony]], under the direction of [[John Mauceri]], gave a [[Porgy and Bess (2006)|concert performance]] at the [[Tennessee Performing Arts Center]]. It incorporated Gershwin's cuts made for the New York premiere, thus giving the audience an idea of what the opera sounded like on its Broadway opening. In 2000 and 2002 the [[New York City Opera]] had a revival directed by [[Tazewell Thompson]]. In 2007, [[Los Angeles Opera]] staged a revival directed by Francesca Zambello and conducted by John DeMain, who led the history-making Houston Opera revival of ''Porgy and Bess'' in 1976.\n\nSouth Africa's [[Cape Town Opera]] has frequently performed ''Porgy and Bess'' abroad, most notably with the [[Welsh National Opera]], [[NorrlandsOperan]], [[Deutsche Oper Berlin]] and at the [[Wales Millennium Centre]], [[Royal Festival Hall]] and [[Edinburgh Festival Theatre]]. In October 2010, its planned tour of the opera to Israel was criticised by [[Desmond Tutu]].<ref>Cape Town Opera, [http://www.capetownopera.co.za/2010/10/27/cape-town-operas-tour-to-israel/ \"Cape Town Opera's Tour To Israel, Press release: 27 October 2010] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120605055626/http://www.capetownopera.co.za/2010/10/27/cape-town-operas-tour-to-israel/ |date=5 June 2012 }}</ref>\n\n=== 2006 ''The Gershwins' Porgy and Bess'' (Nunn adaptation) ===\n''The Gershwins' Porgy and Bess'' premiered on November 9, 2006, at the [[Savoy Theatre]] (London), directed by Trevor Nunn. (Although that was the title given to this production, the 1993 television adaptation of Nunn's 1986 production had also used it.) For this new production, he adapted the lengthy opera to fit the conventions of [[musical theatre]]. Working with the Gershwin and Heyward estates, Nunn used dialogue from the original novel and subsequent Broadway stage play to replace the [[recitative]]s with naturalistic scenes. He did not use operatic voices in this production, but relied on musical theatre actors as leads. [[Gareth Valentine]] provided the musical adaptation. Despite mostly positive reviews,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/6139588.stm |title=Press views: ''Porgy and Bess''|publisher=BBC News |accessdate=August 13, 2008|date=November 11, 2006}}</ref> Nunn's production closed months early due to poor box office.\n\nThis original cast of this version included [[Clarke Peters]] as Porgy, [[Nicola Hughes (actress)|Nicola Hughes]] as Bess, [[O.

Jasbo Brown entertains the community with his piano playing. Clara, a young mother, sings a lullaby to her baby (\"[[Summertime (George Gershwin song)|Summertime]]\") as the working men prepare for a game of [[craps]] (\"Roll them Bones\"). One of the players, Robbins, scorns his wife Serena's demands that he not play, retorting that on a Saturday night, a man has the right to play. Clara's husband, the fisherman Jake, tries his own lullaby (\"A Woman is a Sometime Thing\") with little effect. Little by little, other characters in the opera enter Catfish Row, among them Mingo, another fisherman, and Jim, a cotton-hauling [[stevedore]] who, tired of his job, decides to give it up and join Jake and the other fishermen. Porgy, a disabled beggar, enters on his goat cart to organize the game. Peter, an elderly \"honey man\" [honey vendor] returns, singing his vendor's call. Crown, a strong and brutal stevedore, storms in with his woman, Bess, and buys cheap whiskey and some \"[[cocaine|Happy Dust]]\" off the local dope peddler, Sportin' Life. Bess is shunned by the women of the community, especially the pious Serena and the matriarchal cookshop owner Maria, but Porgy softly defends her. The game begins. One by one, the players get crapped out, leaving only Robbins and Crown, who has become extremely drunk. When Robbins wins, Crown attempts to prevent him from taking his winnings. A brawl ensues, which ends when Crown stabs Robbins with Jim's cotton hook, killing him. Crown runs, telling Bess to fend for herself but that he will be back for her when the heat dies down. Sportin' Life gives her a dose of happy dust and offers to take her with him when he goes to New York, but she rejects him. He flees, and Bess begins to pound on doors, but is rejected by all of the residents of Catfish Row, with the exception of Porgy, who lets her in.\n\n''Scene 2: Serena's Room, the following night''\n\n[[File:PorgyandBessSerena-Glyndebourne.png|thumb|\"My Man's Gone Now\" sung by [[Cynthia Clarey]] in the [[Glyndebourne Festival Opera|Glyndebourne]] production (stage version)]]\nThe mourners sing a spiritual to Robbins (\"Gone, Gone, Gone\"). To raise money for his burial, a saucer is placed on his chest for the mourners' donations (\"Overflow\"). Bess enters with Porgy and attempts to donate to the burial fund, but Serena rejects her money until Bess explains that she is now living with Porgy. A white detective enters and coldly tells Serena that she must bury her husband the next day, or his body will be given to medical students (for [[dissection]]). He suddenly accuses Peter of Robbins's murder. Peter denies his guilt and says Crown was the murderer. The Detective orders Peter to be arrested as a [[material witness]], whom he will force to testify against Crown. Serena laments her loss in \"[[My Man's Gone Now]]\". The undertaker enters. The saucer holds only fifteen dollars of the needed twenty-five, but he agrees to bury Robbins as long as Serena promises to pay him back. Bess, who has been sitting in silence slightly apart from the rest of those gathered, suddenly begins to sing a gospel song and the chorus joyfully join in, welcoming her into the community. (\"Oh, the Train is at de Station\")\n\n=== Act 2 ===\n''Scene 1: Catfish Row, a month later, in the morning''\n\nJake and the other fishermen prepare for work (\"It take a long pull to get there\"). Clara asks Jake not to go because it is time for the annual storms, but he tells her that they desperately need the money. This causes Porgy to sing from his window about his new, happy-go-lucky outlook on life. (\"I got plenty o' nuttin\"). Sportin' Life waltzes around selling \"happy dust\", but soon incurs the wrath of Maria, who threatens him. (\"I hates yo' struttin' style\"). A fraudulent lawyer, Frazier, arrives and farcically divorces Bess from Crown. When he discovers Bess and Crown were not married, he raises his price from a dollar to a dollar and a half. Archdale, a white lawyer, enters and informs Porgy that Peter will soon be released. The bad omen of a buzzard flies over Catfish Row and Porgy demands that it leave now that he finally has found happiness. (\"Buzzard keep on flyin' over\".)\n\nAs the rest of Catfish Row prepares for the church picnic on nearby Kittiwah Island, Sportin' Life again offers to take Bess to New York with him; she refuses. He attempts to give her some \"happy dust\" despite her claims that she's given up drugs, but Porgy grabs his arm and scares him off. Sportin' Life leaves, reminding Bess as he goes that her men friends come and go, but he will be there all along. Bess and Porgy are now left alone, and express their love for each other (\"[[Bess, You Is My Woman Now]]\"). The chorus re-enters in high spirits as they prepare to leave for the picnic (\"Oh, I can't sit down\"). Bess is invited to the picnic by Maria, but she demurs as Porgy cannot come (due to his disability, he cannot get on the boat), but Maria insists. Bess leaves Porgy behind as they go off to the picnic. Porgy watches the boat leave (\"I got plenty o' nuttin\" reprise).\n\n''Scene 2: Kittiwah Island, that evening''\n\nThe chorus enjoys themselves at the picnic (\"I ain't got no shame\"). Sportin' Life presents the chorus his cynical views on the Bible (\"[[It Ain't Necessarily So]]\"), causing Serena to chastise them (\"Shame on all you sinners!\"). Everyone gets ready to leave. As Bess, who has lagged behind, tries to follow them, Crown emerges from the bushes. He reminds her that Porgy is \"temporary\" and laughs off her claims that she has been living decently now. Bess wants to leave Crown forever and attempts to make him forget about her (\"Oh, what you want wid Bess?\") but Crown refuses to give her up. He grabs her and will not let her go to the boat, which leaves without her, and then forcefully kisses her. He laughs at his conquest as her resistance begins to fail, and commands her to get into the woods, where his intentions are only too clear.\n\n''Scene 3: Catfish Row, a week later, just before dawn''\n\nA week later, Jake leaves to go fishing with his crew, one of whom observes that it looks as if a storm is coming in. Peter, still unsure of his crime, returns from prison. Meanwhile, Bess is lying in Porgy's room delirious with fever, which she has had ever since returning from Kittiwah Island. Serena prays to remove Bess's affliction (\"Oh, Doctor Jesus\"), and promises Porgy that Bess will be well by five o'clock. As the day passes, a strawberry woman, Peter (the Honey Man) and a crab man each pass by with their wares (\"Vendors' Trio\"). As the clock chimes five, Bess recovers from her fever. Porgy tells Bess that he knows she has been with Crown, and she admits that Crown has promised to return for her. Porgy tells her she is free to go if she wants to, and she tells him that although she wants to stay, she is afraid of Crown's hold on her. Porgy asks her what would happen if there was no Crown, and Bess tells Porgy she loves him and begs him to protect her. Porgy promises that she will never have to be afraid again (\"[[I Loves You, Porgy]]\").\n\nClara watches the water, fearful for Jake. Maria tries to allay her fears, but suddenly the hurricane bell begins to ring.\n\n''Scene 4: Serena's Room, dawn of the next day''\n\nThe residents of Catfish Row are all gathered in Serena's room for shelter from the hurricane. They drown out the sound of the storm with prayers and hymns (\"Oh, Doctor Jesus\") while Sportin' Life mocks their assumption that the storm is a signal of [[Judgment Day]]. Clara desperately sings her lullaby (\"Summertime\" [reprise]). A knock is heard at the door, and the chorus believes it to be Death (\"Oh there's somebody knocking at the door\"). Crown enters dramatically, having swum from Kittiwah Island, seeking Bess. He shows no fear of God, claiming that after the long struggle from Kittiwah, God and he are friends. The chorus tries to drown out his blaspheming with more prayer, and he taunts them by singing a vulgar song. (\"A red-headed woman\"). Suddenly, Clara sees Jake's boat float past the window, upside-down, and she runs out to try to save him, handing her baby to Bess. Bess asks that one of the men go out with her, and Crown taunts Porgy, who cannot go. Crown goes himself, yelling out as he leaves \"Alright, Big Friend! We're on for another Bout!\" The chorus continue to pray as the storm rises.\n\n=== Act 3 ===\n''Scene 1: Catfish Row, the next night''\n\nA group of women mourn Clara, Jake, and all of those who have been killed in the storm (\"Clara, Clara, don't you be downhearted\"). When they begin to mourn for Crown as well, Sportin' Life laughs at them and is told off by Maria. He insinuates that Crown may not be dead, and observes that when a woman has a man, maybe she's got him for keeps, but if she has ''two'' men, then it's highly likely she'll end up with none. Bess is heard singing Clara's lullaby to her baby, whom she is now taking care of. (\"Summertime\" [reprise]). Once Catfish Row is dark, Crown stealthily enters to claim Bess, but is confronted by Porgy. A fight ensues that ends when Porgy kills Crown. Porgy exclaims to Bess, \"You've got a man now. You've got Porgy!\"\n\n''Scene 2: Catfish Row, the next afternoon''\n\nThe detective enters and talks with Serena and her friends about the murders of Crown and Robbins. They deny knowledge of Crown's murder, frustrating the detective. Needing a witness for the coroner's inquest, he next questions an apprehensive Porgy. Once Porgy admits to knowing Crown, he is ordered to come and identify Crown's body. Sportin' Life tells Porgy that corpses bleed in the presence of their murderers, and the detective will use this to hang Porgy. Porgy refuses to identify the body, but is dragged off anyway. Bess is distraught, and Sportin' Life puts his plan into action. He tells her that Porgy will be locked up for a long time, and points out that he is the only one still here. He offers her happy dust, and though she refuses, he forces it on her. After she takes a whiff, he paints a seductive picture of her life with him in New York (\"There's a boat dat's leavin' soon for New York\"). She regains her strength and rushes inside, slamming the door on his face, but he leaves a packet of happy dust on her doorstep, and settles down to wait.\n\n''Scene 3: Catfish Row, a week later''\n\nOn a beautiful morning, Porgy is released from jail, where he has been arrested for contempt of court after refusing to look at Crown's body. He returns to Catfish Row much richer after playing craps with his cellmates. He gives gifts to the residents, and pulls out a beautiful red dress for Bess. He does not understand why everyone seems so uneasy at his return. He sees Clara's baby is now with Serena and realizes something is wrong. He asks where Bess is. Maria and Serena tell him that Bess has run off with Sportin' Life to New York (\"Oh Bess, Oh Where's my Bess?\"). Porgy calls for his goat cart, and resolves to leave Catfish Row to find her. He prays for strength, and begins his journey. (\"Oh, Lawd, I'm on my way\")\n\n== Racial controversy ==\nFrom the outset, the opera's depiction of [[African Americans]] attracted controversy. [[Virgil Thomson]], a white American composer, stated that \"Folklore subjects recounted by an outsider are only valid as long as the folk in question is unable to speak for itself, which is certainly not true of the American Negro in 1935.\"<ref>[[Virgil Thomson|Thomson, Virgil]] in ''Modern Music'', November\u2013December 1935. pp. 16\u201317.</ref> An apocryphal quote attributed to [[Duke Ellington]] allegedly stated \"the times are here to debunk Gershwin's lampblack Negroisms,\u201d but the quote was probably invented by a journalist who interviewed Ellington about the opera. Ellington publicly repudiated the article shortly after its publication.<ref>{{cite book|first=Howard|last=Pollack|title=George Gershwin|publisher=University of California Press|year=2006|isbn=978-0-520-24864-9|p=167|ref=harv}}</ref> Ellington's response to the 1952 Breen revival was completely the opposite. His telegram to the producer read: \"Your ''Porgy and Bess'' the superbest, singing the gonest, acting the craziest, Gershwin the greatest.\"<ref>Hutchisson, James M. ''DuBose Heyward: A Charleston Gentleman and the World of \"Porgy and Bess.\"'' University of Mississippi Press (2000), {{ISBN|978-1-57806-250-8}}, 165.</ref> Several of the members of the original cast later stated that they, too, had concerns that their characters might play into a [[stereotype]] that African Americans lived in poverty, took drugs and solved their problems with their fists.\n\nA planned production by the Negro Repertory Company of Seattle in the late 1930s, part of the [[Federal Theatre Project]], was cancelled because actors were displeased with what they viewed as a [[racism|racist]] portrayal of aspects of African-American life. The director initially envisioned that they would perform the play in a \"[[Negro]] [[dialect]].\" These [[Pacific Northwest]] African American actors, who did not speak in such dialect, would be coached in it. Florence James attempted a compromise of dropping the use of dialect but the production was canceled.<ref>Becker, Paula. \"[http://www.historylink.org/output.cfm?file_id=3976 \"Negro Repertory Company\"] on HistoryLink.org, November 10, 2002.</ref>\n\nAnother production of ''Porgy and Bess'', this time at the [[University of Minnesota]] in 1939, ran into similar troubles. According to Barbara Cyrus, one of the few black students then at the university, members of the local African-American community saw the play as \"detrimental to the race\" and as a vehicle that promoted racist stereotypes. The play was cancelled due to pressure from the African-American community, which saw their success as proof of the increasing political power of blacks in [[Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul]].<ref>Brady, Tim, [http://www.alumni.umn.edu/The_Way_Spaces_Were_Allocated__African_Americans_on_Campus__Part_II.html \"The Way Spaces Were Allocated: African Americans on Campus, Part II\"], ''Minnesota'', November\u2013December 2002, University of Minnesota Alumni Association.</ref>\n\nThe belief that ''Porgy and Bess'' was racist gained strength during the [[Civil Rights Movement]] and [[Black Power movement]] of the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s. As these movements advanced, ''Porgy and Bess'' was seen as more and more out of date. When the play was revived in the 1960s, social critic and African-American educator [[Harold Cruse]] called it, \"The most incongruous, contradictory cultural symbol ever created in the Western World.\"<ref name=JS>Standifer, James, [https://web.archive.org/web/20050211025941/https://www.neh.gov/news/humanities/1997-11/porgy.html \"The Complicated Life of ''Porgy and Bess''\"], ''Humanities'', November/December 1997, Volume 18, Number 6</ref>\n\nIn the 1976 Houston Opera production, the director, Sherwin Goldman, had trouble finding interested performers. Goldman, a white Texas native and a graduate of Yale and Oxford Universities, recalled, \"I was auditioning singers all around the country, I guess thirty cities in all, from theater groups to church choirs, but was having a hard time finding directors ... I don't think there was a single black person, of those who had never been associated with Porgy, who didn't seriously bad-mouth it.\" Nevertheless, a cast was assembled of African American classically trained performers from all around the country.<ref>{{cite book|last=Albert|first=H.|title=The Life and Times of 'Porgy and Bess'|date=1990|publisher=Knopf|page=298}}</ref>\n\nGershwin's all-black opera was also unpopular with some celebrated black artists. [[Harry Belafonte]] declined to play Porgy in the late 1950s film version, so the role went to [[Sidney Poitier]]. Betty Allen, president of [[The Harlem School of the Arts]], admittedly loathed the piece, and [[Grace Bumbry]], who excelled in the 1985 Metropolitan Opera production as Bess, made the often cited statement: <blockquote>I thought it beneath me, I felt I had worked far too hard, that we had come far too far to have to retrogress to 1935. My way of dealing with it was to see that it was really a piece of [[Americana]], of American history, whether we liked it or not. Whether I sing it or not, it was still going to be there.<ref name=JS /></blockquote>\n\nOver time, however, the opera gained acceptance from the opera community and some (though not all)<ref>[http://www.firstunitarian.net/publications/sermon/20000820s.asp Reverend Phyllis L. Hubbell, \"I Got Plenty O Nuttin\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050529085155/http://www.firstunitarian.net/publications/sermon/20000820s.asp |date=2005-05-29 }}, sermon at the First Unitarian Church of Baltimore, August 20, 2000.</ref> in the African-American community. Maurice Peress stated in 2004 that \"''Porgy and Bess'' belongs as much to the black singer-actors who bring it to life as it does to the Heywards and the Gershwins.\"<ref>Peress, Maurice. \"[http://newmusicbox.org/article.nmbx?id=4308 George Gershwin and African American Music] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050728150231/http://newmusicbox.org/article.nmbx?id=4308 |date=2005-07-28 }}. ''New MusicBox'', 8 July 2005</ref> Indeed, Ira Gershwin stipulated that only blacks be allowed to play the lead roles when the opera was performed in the United States, launching the careers of several prominent opera singers.\n\nThat Gershwin sought to write a true jazz opera, and that he believed that [[Metropolitan Opera]] staff singers could never master the jazz idiom, which could instead only be sung by a black cast, seems to indicate he did not intend the work to belittle African-Americans. Some black singers were overjoyed at Gershwin's work, going so far as to describe him as the \"Abraham Lincoln of Negro music\".{{sfn|Pollack|2006|pp=597\u201398}} Much of the racial controversy seems to arise from the miscegenation of Gershwin's jazz experience. Gershwin wrote Porgy through an idiom of jazz that was influenced by Western European opera traditions, African-American music, and Russian-Jewish music.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ross|first=Alex|authorlink=Alex Ross (music critic)|title=The Rest Is Noise|pages=[https://archive.org/details/restisnoiseliste00ross/page/147 147\u2013150]|year=2007|publisher=[[Farrar, Straus and Giroux]]|isbn=9780374249397|title-link=The Rest Is Noise}}</ref>\n\nDuring the era of [[apartheid in South Africa]], several South African theatre companies planned to put on all-white productions of ''Porgy and Bess''. [[Ira Gershwin]], as heir to his brother, consistently refused to permit these productions to be staged. But in 2009, [[Cape Town Opera]]'s production, set in 1970s South Africa and inspired by life in [[Soweto]], toured Britain, opening at the [[Wales Millennium Centre]] in Cardiff and going on to the [[Royal Festival Hall]] in London and [[Edinburgh Festival Theatre]]. Most of the cast were black South Africans; American singers involved in the production have found the \"passionate identification with the opera\" by the South African singers \"a wake-up call\".\n\n{{quote|\"I think we've got a little jaded in the US with ''Porgy and Bess'',\" says Lisa Daltirus, one of two singers who will play Bess on the UK tour. \"A lot of people just think that this is a show that is lovely to listen to and happened way back when. They're not thinking that you can still find places where this is real. And if we're not careful we could be right back there.\"|''[[The Times]]'', London, October 16, 2009<ref>[http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/stage/opera/article6876619.ece \"Cape Town Opera brings ''Porgy and Bess'' to Europe\u2014The only opera company in South Africa is on the road to Britain with a ''Porgy and Bess'' set in the depths of apartheid\"], ''[[The Times]]'', London, October 16, 2009, Retrieved on October 21, 2009</ref>}}\n\nA 2017/2018 staging of the opera by the [[Hungarian State Opera]] featured a predominantly white cast. While the opera was presented in the context of the [[Refugees of the Syrian Civil War|Syrian migrant crisis]] (moved from Catfish Row to an airport), the controversy of recasting continued. While the Hungarian State Opera, in discussions with the [[Tams-Witmark Music Library]] originally agreed to the casting requirements, it ultimately declined to do so when the wording was not included in the written contract. This production galvanized conservative commentators who lauded it as a success over \"political correctness\". Ultimately, Tams-Witmark required the Hungarian State Opera to include in its printed material that this production \"is contrary to the requirements for the presentation of this work\".<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/30/arts/music/progy-and-bess-white-cast-budapest.html \"''Porgy and Bess'' With a White Cast Stirs Controversy\"] by Alexandra Ivanoff, ''[[The New York Times]]'', 30 January 2018</ref>\n\n== Musical elements ==\nIn the summer of 1934, George Gershwin worked on the opera in [[Charleston, South Carolina]]. He drew inspiration from the James Island [[Gullah]] community, which he felt had preserved some African musical traditions. This research added to the authenticity of his work.<ref>Ewen, David, ''The Home Book of 20th Century Music'', Arco, 1956, p. 138</ref>\n\nThe music itself reflects his New York jazz roots, but also draws on southern black traditions. Gershwin modeled the pieces after each type of [[folk song]] which the composer knew about; jubilees, [[blues]], praying songs, street cries, work songs, and spirituals are blended with traditional [[aria]]s and [[recitative]]s.<ref name=JS />\n\nThe most fundamental influences on the composition and orchestrations in evidence throughout ''Porgy and Bess'', aside from those of American Jazz and Black religious music, are the European composers whose music Gershwin studied and absorbed during his tutelage with the likes of [[Edward Kilenyi]], [[Rubin Goldmark]], [[Charles Hambitzer]], and [[Henry Cowell]].<ref>unconservatory.org</ref> Cowell's key contribution, however, may have been to suggest that Gershwin study with [[Joseph Schillinger]],{{sfn|Pollack|2006|p=127}} whose influence, if not as important as his followers claim, is notable throughout. Some commenters have believed they heard simililarities to melodies heard in [[Jewish music|Jewish liturgical music]] in Gershwin's opera. Gershwin biographer [[Edward Jablonski]] heard a similarity between the melody of \"It Ain't Necessarily So\" and the [[Haftarah#Haftarah cantillation|Haftarah blessing]],<ref>{{harvnb|Jablonski|1987}}), cited in Benaroya, Adam (May 2000) [http://www.ilperetz.org/graduates/adam_benaroya.htm \"The Jewish Roots in George Gershwin's Music\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051214125934/http://ilperetz.org/graduates/adam_benaroya.htm |date=2005-12-14 }}, I.L.

Many of these represent individual characters: some of these are fragments of the opera's set numbers (Sportin' Life, for example, is frequently represented by the melody which sets the title words of \"It Ain't Necessarily So\"). Other motifs represent objects (such as the sleazy chromatic \"Happy Dust\" motif) or places, notably Catfish Row. Many of the through-composed passages of the score combine or develop these leitmotifs in order to reflect the on-stage action. Particularly sophisticated uses of this techniques can be seen after the aria \"There's a boat dat's leaving soon for New York\" in act 3, scene 2. The opera also frequently reprises its set numbers (these might be considered extended ''Leitsektionen''). Notable in this respect are the reprises of \"Bess, you is my woman now\" and \"I got plenty o' nuttin' \" which conclude act 2, scene 1. The song \"[[Summertime (George Gershwin song)|Summertime]]\" is stated four times alone.\n\nThe duration of the work is about 180 minutes.\n\n===Instrumentation===\nThe work is scored for two [[Western concert flute|flutes]] (second doubling [[piccolo]]), two [[oboe]]s (second doubling [[English horn]]), three [[clarinet]]s in B-flat (second and third doubling [[alto saxophone]]s), one [[bass clarinet]] in B-flat (doubling fourth clarinet and [[tenor saxophone]]), one [[bassoon]]; three [[French horn]]s in F, three [[trumpet]]s in B-flat, one [[trombone]], one [[bass trombone]], one [[tuba]]; a percussion section that includes [[timpani]], [[xylophone]], [[triangle (musical instrument)|triangle]], [[glockenspiel]], suspended and crash [[cymbal]]s, [[snare drum]], [[tom-tom]]s, [[bass drum]], African drums, an unspecified small drum, [[tubular bells]], [[Woodblock (instrument)|wood block]], [[temple block]]s, cowbell, [[sandpaper]] and [[train whistle]]; one [[piano]]; and [[string section|strings]].<ref>{{cite book|last= Gershwin|first= George|title= Porgy and Bess|publisher= Schott|year= 1935}}</ref>\n\n== Recordings ==\n{{Main|Porgy and Bess discography}}\n\nThe 1976 and 1977 recordings of the opera won Grammy Awards for [[Best Opera Recording]], making ''Porgy and Bess'' the only opera to win this award over two consecutive years.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/awards/winners-nominees/106|title=Winners|work=GRAMMY.com|access-date=2018-01-30|language=en}}</ref>\n\n=== Excerpts ===\nDays after the Broadway premiere of ''Porgy and Bess'' with an all-black cast, two white opera singers, [[Lawrence Tibbett]] and [[Helen Jepson]], both members of the [[Metropolitan Opera]], recorded highlights of the opera in a New York sound studio,<ref>[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001BIKQBI Amazon.com: ''Porgy and Bess'' (Selections): Act 2: It Ain't Necessarily So (1998 Remastered): Lawrence Tibbett: MP3 Downloads<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> released as ''[[Highlights from Porgy and Bess]]''.\n\nMembers of the original cast were not recorded until 1940, when [[Todd Duncan]] and [[Anne Brown]] recorded selections from the work. Two years later, when the first Broadway revival occurred, American [[Decca Records|Decca]] rushed other members of the cast into the recording studio to record other selections not recorded in 1940. These two albums were marketed as a two-volume 78 rpm set ''[[Selections from George Gershwin's Folk Opera Porgy and Bess]]''. After LPs began to be manufactured in 1948, the recording was transferred to LP, and subsequently, to CD.<ref>[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000002OJM Amazon.com: Gershwin: Porgy & Bess [With Members of the Original Cast&#93;: George Gershwin, Alexander Smallens, Todd Duncan, Anne Brown, Avon Long: Music<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nAlso in 1940, baritone [[Bruce Foote]] released a 78-RPM album of selections from ''Porgy and Bess''.<ref>[http://castalbums.org/recordings/Porgy_and_Bess_1940_Bruce_Foote/17950 ''Porgy and Bess'', Bruce Foote : CastAlbums.org<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nIn 1942, [[Mabel Mercer]] and [[Cy Walter]] released a 78-RPM jazz album of excerpts from the opera on an obscure label.<ref>[http://castalbums.org/recordings/Mabel_Mercer_Sings_Cy_Walter_Plays_Selection_from_George_Gershwins_Porgy_and_Bess_1942_Mabel_Mercer_Cy_Walter/18908 Mabel Mercer Sings, Cy Walter Plays... Selection from George Gershwin's Porgy and Bess]</ref>\n\nAlthough members of the jazz community initially felt that a Jewish piano player and a white novelist could not adequately convey the plight of blacks in a 1930s Charleston ghetto, jazz musicians warmed up more to the opera after twenty years, and more jazz-based recordings of it began to appear. [[Louis Armstrong]] and [[Ella Fitzgerald]] recorded [[Porgy and Bess (Ella Fitzgerald and Louis Armstrong album)|an album in 1957]] in which they sang and scatted Gershwin's tunes. The next year, [[Miles Davis]] recorded what some consider a [[Porgy and Bess (Miles Davis album)|seminal interpretation]] of the opera arranged for [[big band]].\n\nIn 1959, [[Columbia Masterworks Records]] released a soundtrack album of Samuel Goldwyn's film version of ''Porgy and Bess'', which had been made that year. It was not a complete version of the opera, nor was it even a complete version of the film soundtrack, which featured more music than could be contained on a single LP. The album remained in print until the early 1970s, when it was withdrawn from stores at the request of the Gershwin estate. It is the first stereo album of music from ''Porgy and Bess'' with an all-black cast. However, according to the album [[liner notes]], [[Sammy Davis Jr.]] was under contract to another recording company, and his vocal tracks for the film could not be used on the album. [[Cab Calloway]] substituted his own vocals of Sportin' Life's songs. [[Robert McFerrin]] was the singing voice of Porgy, and [[Adele Addison]] the singing voice of Bess. The white singer [[Loulie Jean Norman]] was the singing voice of Clara (portrayed onscreen by [[Diahann Carroll]]), and [[Inez Matthews]] the singing voice of Serena (portrayed onscreen by [[Ruth Attaway]]).\n\nIn 1963, [[Leontyne Price]] and [[William Warfield]], who had starred in the 1952 world tour of ''Porgy and Bess'', recorded their own album of excerpts from the opera for [[RCA Victor]]. None of the other singers from that production appeared on that album, but [[John W. Bubbles]], the original Sportin' Life, substituted for Cab Calloway (who had played Sportin' Life onstage in the 1952 production).<ref>[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00000I9MJ Amazon.com: Porgy & Bess: High Performance: William Warfield, John W. Bubbles, Leontyne Price: Music<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The 1963 recording of ''Porgy and Bess'' excerpts remains the only official recording of the score on which Bubbles sings Sportin' Life's two big numbers.\n\nIn, 1976, for RCA Victor, [[Ray Charles]] and [[Cleo Laine]] recorded an album of excerpts in which the two of them sang several roles. The album was arranged and conducted by [[Frank De Vol]]. It featured the organ of [[Joe Sample]], the trumpet of [[Harry Edison]] and guitar work of [[Joe Pass]] and [[Lee Ritenour]]. It was jazz-based with full orchestrations, but the orchestrations used were not Gershwin's.\n\nIn 1990, [[Leonard Slatkin]] conducted an album of excerpts from the opera, released on a [[Philips Records]] CD, with Simon Estes (who sang Porgy in the first Metropolitan Opera production of the work) and Roberta Alexander.\n\n=== Complete recordings ===\n* 1951: [[Columbia Masterworks]]: the company recorded a 3-LP album of what was then the standard performing version of ''Porgy and Bess'' \u2013 the most complete recording made of the opera up to that time. It was billed as a \"complete\" version, but was complete only insofar as that was the way the work was usually performed then. (Actually, nearly an hour was cut from the opera.) Because album producer [[Goddard Lieberson]] was eager to bring as much of ''Porgy and Bess'' as he felt was practical on records at the time, the recording featured more of Gershwin's original recitatives and orchestrations than had ever been heard before. The recording was conducted by [[Lehman Engel]], and starred [[Lawrence Winters]] and [[Camilla Williams]], both from the [[New York City Opera]]. Several singers who had been associated with the original 1935 production and the 1942 revival of ''Porgy and Bess'' were finally given a chance to record their roles more or less complete. The album was highly acclaimed as a giant step in recorded opera in its time. It was re-released at budget price on the Odyssey label in the early 1970s. It has subsequently appeared on CD on Sony's \"Masterworks Heritage\" CD series, and on the Naxos label as well. The album is not sung in as directly \"operatic\" a style as later versions, treading a fine line between opera and musical theatre.\n* 1952: [[Guild (CD label)|Guild]] (not released until 2008): A live recording of a September 21, 1952, performance of ''Porgy and Bess'', starring Leontyne Price, William Warfield, Cab Calloway and the rest of the cast of the 1952 Davis-Breen revival. This is the only known recording of an actual performance made from the historic and highly acclaimed 1952 world tour of the opera. While the opera itself is not performed truly complete, it is a complete recording of that specific performance. [[Alexander Smallens]], who led the original 1935 production and the 1942 revival, conducts. Some of the sung recitatives are still performed as spoken dialogue in the production.\n* 1956: [[Bethlehem Records]]: A version of the opera more heavily oriented toward jazz than the original. [[Mel Torm\u00e9]] sings Porgy and [[Frances Faye]] is Bess.<ref>[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000AAIXQS Amazon.com: Porgy & Bess: George Gershwin: Music<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The only 3-LP version of most of the opera with white singers. (Released on CD by [[Rhino Records]].)\n* 1976: [[Decca Records]]: The first complete recording of the opera based on Gershwin's original score, restoring the material cut by Gershwin during rehearsals for the New York premiere in 1935, was made by the [[Cleveland Orchestra]] under [[Lorin Maazel]] in 1976 for Decca Records in the UK and [[London Records]] in the U.S., in time for the U.S. Bicentennial. It starred [[Willard White]] singing his first Porgy, and [[Leona Mitchell]] as Bess. The recording was praised by critics for its performance quality and racial significance, but at the same time was highly criticized by some{{By whom|date=October 2014}} for not bringing out the \"jazzier\" qualities of the score.\n* 1977: RCA Victor: A complete recording of the opera by the [[Houston Grand Opera]] based on the complete original score.\n* 1989: [[EMI]]: [[Porgy and Bess (Glyndebourne album)|The Glyndebourne album]] also based on the complete original score, without Gershwin's cuts.<ref>Music was played by the [[London Philharmonic Orchestra]] and conducted by [[Simon Rattle]].

The musical cuts made on this album coincide almost exactly with those in the 1951 album, with the exception that \"The Buzzard Song\", usually cut in early productions, is heard on the 1951 album, and the \"Occupational Humoresque\", heard on the 2006 album, is not heard on the 1951 album at all. This version stars [[Marquita Lister]] as Bess.\n* 2010: RCA Victor: [[Nikolaus Harnoncourt]], an unusual choice for this Gershwin opera, conducted a recording of an almost complete ''Porgy and Bess'', which was released in the U.S. in September 2010. Gregg Baker, who sang Crown in the 1985 Metropolitan Opera production, the 1986 Glyndebourne production, the 1989 EMI recording made with the Glyndebourne cast, and in the 1993 television adaptation of that production, repeated his performance here, but the roles of Porgy and Bess are taken by two singers virtually unknown in the U.S., [[Jonathan Lemalu]] and [[Isabelle Kabatu]].\n* 2014: EuroArts Music International: DVD and Blu-ray recorded live by [[San Francisco Opera]] in June 2009, with [[Eric Owens (bass-baritone)|Eric Owens]] and [[Laquita Mitchell]] in the title roles.<ref>Janos Gereben, [https://www.sfcv.org/article/porgy-amp-bess-on-dvd-and-blu-ray \"''Porgy and Bess'' on DVD and Blu-Ray\"], ''San Francisco Classical Voice'' on sfcv.org</ref>\n\n== Adaptations ==\n\n=== Film ===\n\n====1959 film====\n[[File:Porgy and Bess (1959 film poster).jpg|thumb|upright|Poster for the 1959 film version]]\nA [[Porgy and Bess (film)|1959 film version]], produced in 70&nbsp;mm [[Todd-AO]] by [[Samuel Goldwyn]], was plagued with problems. Rouben Mamoulian, who had directed the 1935 Broadway premiere, was hired to direct the film, but was subsequently fired in favor of director [[Otto Preminger]] after a disagreement with the producer. Mamoulian urged making the film on location in [[South Carolina]] after a fire on the sound stage destroyed the film's sets. Goldwyn, who never liked making films on location, considered Mamoulian's request a sign of disloyalty.{{sfn|Marx|1976|p={{page needed|date=July 2019}}}} [[Robert McFerrin]] dubbed the singing voice for [[Sidney Poitier]]'s Porgy as did [[Adele Addison]] for [[Dorothy Dandridge]]'s Bess. [[Ruth Attaway]]'s Serena and [[Diahann Carroll]]'s Clara were also dubbed. Although Dandridge and Carroll were singers, their voices were not considered operatic enough. [[Sammy Davis Jr.]], [[Brock Peters]] and [[Pearl Bailey]] (who played Sportin' Life, Crown and Maria, respectively) were the only principals who provided their own singing. [[Andr\u00e9 Previn]]'s adaptation of the score won him an [[Academy Award]], the film's only Oscar.\n\nThe Gershwin estate was disappointed with the film, as the score was substantially edited to make it more like a [[musical theatre|musical]]. Much of the music was omitted from the film, and many of Gershwin's orchestrations were either changed or completely scrapped. It was shown on [[network television]] in the U.S. only once, in 1967. Critics attacked it for not being faithful to Gershwin's opera, for over-refining the language grammatically, and for its \"overblown\" staging. The film was removed from release in 1974 by the Gershwin estate. In 2011, it was selected to the U.S. [[National Film Registry]].\n\n[[Mike Medavoy]] and Bobby Geisler announced in 2019 that they are developing a re-envisioned and updated film version with the approval of the Gershwin estate.<ref>{{cite web|last=McNary|first=Dave|title=''Porgy and Bess'': Gershwins' Opera Gets Film Update (Exclusive)|url=https://variety.com/2013/film/news/porgy-and-bess-movie-1200333773/|date=5 April 2013|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|access-date=21 May 2019}}</ref><ref>{{IMDb title|tt10361964|Porgy and Bess|(in development)}}</ref>\n\n====Other films====\nThe 1945 [[Warner Bros.]] film biography of Gershwin, ''[[Rhapsody in Blue (film)|Rhapsody in Blue]]'', featured an extended musical scene recreating the opening of the original Broadway production of ''Porgy and Bess''. Included was the original Bess, Anne Brown, recreating her performance. The scene includes a more elaborate (and historically inaccurate) arrangement for the film of the song \"Summertime\", sung by Anne Brown as Bess with full chorus, but the Catfish Row set design is a virtual duplicate of the one seen in the 1935 Broadway stage production.\n\nThe 1985 film ''[[White Nights (1985 film)|White Nights]]'' featured a scene in which [[Gregory Hines]] performed \"There's a Boat Dat's Leavin' Soon for New York\" as Sportin' Life. Hines' rendition, before a Siberian audience, included a [[tap dance|tap dancing]] sequence. Director [[Taylor Hackford]] pointed out in a special edition DVD release of the film that it was necessary to locate a Russian woman of color (Helene Denbey) to portray Bess, as per Gershwin's stipulations.\n\n=== Television ===\nIn 1993, Trevor Nunn's Glyndebourne Festival stage production of ''Porgy and Bess'', not to be confused with his later production, was greatly expanded scenically and [[videotape]]d in a [[television]] studio without an audience. This first Nunn production was also called ''The Gershwins' 'Porgy and Bess' '' when shown on television. It was telecast by the BBC in England and by PBS in the United States. It featured a cast of operatic American singers, with the exception of Willard White, who is Jamaican but sounded American, as Porgy. [[Cynthia Haymon]] sang the role of Bess. Nunn's \"opening up\" of the stage production was considered highly imaginative; his cast received much critical praise,<ref>{{cite news|last=Porterfield |first=Christopher |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,979313,00.html |title=Conjuring Up Catfish Row |publisher=TIME |date=October 4, 1993|accessdate=February 4, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE1DB163AF935A35753C1A965958260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=2 |title=Review/Television; Two Law Series Return, With Some Revisions|work=The New York Times |date=October 6, 1993|accessdate=February 4, 2010 | first=John J. | last=O'Connor}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://homevideo.about.com/od/dvdreviewslong/a/PorgyBessDVDMoa.htm |title=Porgy & Bess Movie DVD Review \u2013 About.com |publisher=Homevideo.about.com |date= |accessdate=February 4, 2010}}</ref> and the three-hour production retained nearly all of Gershwin's music, heard in the original 1935 orchestrations. This included the opera's sung recitatives, which have occasionally been turned into spoken dialogue in other productions. No extra dialogue was written for this production, as had been done in the 1959 film. All performers lip-synched rather than singing live on set, leading ''[[The New York Times]]'' to write: \"What you hear is basically Mr. Nunn's acclaimed Glyndebourne Festival production, the original cast intact. What you see was filmed later in a London studio. The performers, some new to the production, are lip-synching. It's as if an elaborate visual aid had been concocted for the EMI recording.\"\n\nThis ''Porgy and Bess'' production was subsequently released on [[VHS]] and [[DVD]]. It has won far greater acclaim than the 1959 film, which was widely panned by most critics. The 1993 television production of ''Porgy and Bess'' was nominated for four [[Emmy Award]]s, and won for its [[art direction]].<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107854/awards ''Porgy and Bess'' (1993) (TV) \u2013 Awards<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> It also won a [[BAFTA]] Award for Best Video Lighting.<ref>[http://www.bafta.org/awards-database.html?sq=Porgy+and+Bess Awards Database \u2013 The BAFTA site<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nIn 2002, the [[New York City Opera]] telecast its new version of the Houston Opera production, in a live performance from the stage of [[Lincoln Center]]. This version featured far more cuts than the previous telecast, but, like nearly all stage versions produced since 1976, used the sung recitatives and Gershwin's orchestrations. The telecast also included interviews with director [[Tazewell Thompson]] and was hosted by [[Beverly Sills]].\n\nIn 2009 the San Francisco Opera debuted the Gershwins' ''Porgy and Bess'' to critical acclaim. The production was recorded at that time and shown on PBS in the fall of 2014, and was later released on [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray]].\n\n=== Radio ===\nOn December 1, 1935, during the Broadway run, Todd Duncan and Anne Brown performed \"Summertime\", \"I Got Plenty o' Nuttin'\" and \"Bess, You Is My Woman Now\" on NBC's ''[[The Magic Key of RCA]]'' radio program. Duncan and Brown also appeared on the 1937 CBS Gershwin memorial concert on September 8, 1937, broadcast from the [[Hollywood Bowl]] less than two months after the composer's death, along with several other members of the Broadway cast, including [[John W. Bubbles]] and [[Ruby Elzy]]. They performed several selections from the opera.\n\nThe complete ''Porgy and Bess'' has been broadcast by the Metropolitan Opera three times as part of the [[Metropolitan Opera radio broadcasts|Met's live radio broadcast series]]. The 1985 broadcast performance starred [[Simon Estes]] and [[Grace Bumbry]].<ref>http://archives.metoperafamily.org/archives/frame.htm</ref> In 1986 Ms. Bumbry was heard with Robert Mosley as Porgy. In 1990, Estes and [[Leona Mitchell]] sang the leads in the third broadcast.\n\n=== Concert ===\nGershwin prepared an orchestral suite containing music from the opera after ''Porgy and Bess'' closed early on Broadway. Though it was originally titled \"Suite from ''Porgy and Bess''\", Ira later renamed it ''[[Catfish Row]]''.\n\nIn 1942 [[Robert Russell Bennett]] arranged a medley (rather than a suite) for orchestra which has often been heard in the concert hall, known as ''[[Porgy and Bess: A Symphonic Picture]]''. It is based on Gershwin's original scoring, though for a slightly different instrumentation (the piano was removed from the orchestral texture at the request of the conductor [[Fritz Reiner]], for whom the arrangement was made). [[Morton Gould]] also arranged an orchestral suite in the 1950s.\n\nBennett's 40-minute ''Porgy and Bess'', a concert version for soprano and baritone soloists, chorus and orchestra was prepared in 1956. It is based very closely on Gershwin's original instrumental and vocal scoring, the principal recasting being the use of standard concert-orchestra instrumentation, eliminating the clarinet-saxophone doubling specified in Gershwin's 1935 orchestration.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}\n\n=== Piano ===\nIn 1951, Australian-born composer [[Percy Grainger]], who was an admirer, performer and arranger of Gershwin's music, completed a twenty-minute piece for two pianos titled ''Fantasy on George Gershwin's \"Porgy and Bess\"''.\n\nThe pianist [[Earl Wild]] prepared a virtuoso piano arrangement in the manner of [[Franz Liszt]], entitled ''Fantasy on Gershwin's \"Porgy & Bess\"''.\n\n=== Brass quintet version ===\n* In 1987 the [[Canadian Brass]] commissioned Luther Henderson to create an arrangement of Porgy and Bess music for an RCA Red Seal recording release \"Strike Up The Band\".

It was adapted from [[Dorothy Heyward]] and DuBose Heyward's play ''[[Porgy (play)|Porgy]]'', itself an adaptation of DuBose Heyward's [[Porgy (novel)|1925 novel]] of the same name.\n\n''Porgy and Bess'' was first performed in Boston on September 30, 1935, before it moved to [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in New York City.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SUsgBQAAQBAJ&lpg=PA102|title=Poitier Revisited: Reconsidering a Black Icon in the Obama Age|last=Strachan|first=Ian Gregory|last2=Mask|first2=Mia|date=2014-11-27|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing USA|isbn=9781623562977|location=|pages=102|language=en}}</ref> It featured a cast of classically trained African-American singers\u2014a daring artistic choice at the time. After an initially unpopular public reception, a 1976 [[Porgy and Bess#1976 Houston Grand Opera production|Houston Grand Opera]] production gained it new popularity, and it is now one of the best-known and most frequently performed operas.\n\nThe libretto of ''Porgy and Bess'' tells the story of Porgy, a disabled black street-beggar living in the slums of Charleston. It deals with his attempts to rescue Bess from the clutches of Crown, her violent and possessive lover, and Sportin' Life, her drug dealer. The opera plot generally follows the stage play.\n\nIn the years following Gershwin's death, ''Porgy and Bess'' was adapted for smaller scale performances. It was [[Porgy and Bess (film)|adapted as a film]] in 1959. Some of the songs in the opera, such as \"[[Summertime (George Gershwin song)|Summertime]]\", became popular and are frequently recorded. \n\nIn the late 20th and early 21st centuries, the trend has been toward productions with greater fidelity to Gershwin's original intentions. Smaller-scale productions also continue to be mounted. A complete recorded version of the score was released in 1976; since then, it has been recorded several times.\n\n==Inception==\nThe origin of ''Porgy and Bess'' is DuBose Heyward's 1925 novel [[Porgy (novel)|''Porgy'']]. Heyward produced a [[Porgy (play)|play by the same name]] with [[Dorothy Heyward]].\n\nGeorge Gershwin read ''Porgy'' in 1926 and proposed to Heyward to collaborate on an operatic version. In 1934, Gershwin and Heyward began work on the project by visiting the author's native [[Charleston, South Carolina]]. In a 1935 ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' article, Gershwin explained his motivation for calling ''Porgy and Bess'' a folk opera:\n<blockquote>Porgy and Bess is a folk tale. Its people naturally would sing folk music. When I first began work in the music I decided against the use of original folk material because I wanted the music to be all of one piece. Therefore I wrote my own spirituals and folksongs. But they are still folk music\u2014and therefore, being in operatic form, ''Porgy and Bess'' becomes a folk opera.<ref>{{cite news|last=Gershwin|first=George|title=Gershwin explains why his 'Porgy and Bess' is called 'folk opera'|newspaper=The New York Times|date=November 2, 1935}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n== Composition history ==\n{{Expand section|date=March 2015}}\n\nIn the fall of 1933 Gershwin and Heyward signed a contract with the Theatre Guild to write the opera. In the summer of 1934 Gershwin and Heyward went to [[Folly Beach, South Carolina]] (a small island near Charleston), where Gershwin got a feel for the locale and its music. He worked on the opera there and in New York. Ira Gershwin, in New York, wrote lyrics to some of the opera's classic songs, most notably \"It Ain't Necessarily So\". Most of the lyrics, including \"Summertime\", were written by Heyward, who also wrote the libretto.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.wfmt.com/offmic/2016/01/22/the-true-origins-of-gershwins-summertime/|title=The true origins of Gershwin's Summertime|accessdate=December 31, 2016|author=Stephen Raskauskas=2016}}</ref>\n\n== Performance history ==\n=== 1935 original Broadway production ===\n[[File:Ruby Elzy (1935).jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Ruby Elzy]] as Serena in the original Broadway production of ''Porgy and Bess'' (1935)]]\n[[File:John W.

He chose as his choral director [[Eva Jessye]], who also directed her own renowned choir. The world premiere performance took place at the [[Colonial Theatre (Boston)|Colonial Theatre]] in Boston on September 30, 1935\u2014the try-out for a work intended initially for Broadway where the opening took place at the [[Neil Simon Theatre|Alvin Theatre]] in New York City on October 10, 1935.{{sfn|Jablonski|Stewart|1973|pp=227\u2013229}} During rehearsals and in Boston, Gershwin made many cuts and refinements to shorten the running time and tighten the dramatic action. The run on Broadway lasted 124 performances. The production and direction were entrusted to [[Rouben Mamoulian]], who had previously directed the Broadway productions of Heyward's play ''Porgy''. The music director was [[Alexander Smallens]]. The leading roles were played by [[Todd Duncan]] and [[Anne Brown]]. {{citation needed-span|date=August 2019|text=Brown was a 20-year-old student at [[Juilliard]], the first African-American vocalist admitted there, when she read that George Gershwin was going to write a musical version of ''Porgy''.

During the Washington run, the cast\u2014as led by Todd Duncan\u2014protested [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregation]] at the [[National Theatre (Washington, D.C.)|National Theatre]]. Eventually management gave in to the demands, resulting in the first integrated audience for a performance of any show at that venue.<ref name=loc>[https://www.loc.gov/item/today-in-history/september-02/ ''Porgy and Bess''], ''American Memory'': \"Today in History, September 2\",'' Library of Congress</ref>\n\nIn 1938, much of the original cast reunited for a [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] revival that played in [[Los Angeles]] and at the [[Curran Theatre]] in [[San Francisco]]. [[Avon Long]] took on the role of Sportin' Life for the first time, a role he would continue to play in many productions over a long career.\n\n=== 1942 Broadway revival ===\nThe noted director and producer [[Cheryl Crawford]] produced professional stock theater in [[Maplewood, New Jersey]], for three very successful seasons. The last of these closed with ''Porgy and Bess'', which she co-produced with [[John Wildberg]]. In re-fashioning it in the style of [[musical theatre]] which Americans were used to hearing from Gershwin, Crawford produced a drastically cut version of the opera compared with the first Broadway staging. The orchestra was reduced, the cast was halved, and many [[recitative]]s were reduced to spoken dialog.<ref name=JS />\n\nHaving seen the performance, theater owner [[Lee Shubert]] arranged for Crawford to bring her production to Broadway. The show opened at the [[Majestic Theatre (Broadway)|Majestic Theatre]] in January 1942.<ref>''Victor Book of the Opera'' New York: Simon and Schuster, 1968, pp. 326\u2013328</ref> Duncan and Brown reprised their roles as the title characters, with Alexander Smallens again conducting. In June the contralto [[Etta Moten]], whom Gershwin had first envisioned as Bess, replaced Brown in the role. Moten was such a success that Bess became her signature role. The Crawford production ran for nine months and was far more successful financially than the original.\n\nRadio station [[WOR (AM)|WOR]] in New York broadcast a live one-hour version on May 7, 1942. The cast included Todd Duncan, Anne Brown, Ruby Elzy, [[Avon Long]], [[Edward Matthews (baritone)|Edward Matthews]], Harriet Jackson, Georgette Harvey, Jack Carr, and the Eva Jessye Choir; the WOR Symphony was conducted by [[Alfred Wallenstein]]. The 12&Prime;-diameter 78 rpm, glass base, lacquer-coated disks were transferred to open-reel tape on February 6, 1975.\n\n=== European premieres ===\nOn March 27, 1943, the opera had its European premiere at the [[Royal Danish Theatre]] in Copenhagen. Performed during the [[Nazism|Nazi]] occupation of the country, this performance was notable for being performed by an all-white cast made up in [[blackface]]. After 22 sold-out performances, the Nazis forced the theatre to close the production.<ref name=JS/> Other all-white or mostly-white productions in Europe, reflecting contemporary demographics in the countries, took place in [[Zurich]], Switzerland, in 1945 and 1950, and [[Gothenburg]] and [[Stockholm]], Sweden, in 1948.\n[[File:Leontyne Price-Porgy and Bess.jpg|thumb|upright|Leontyne Price as Bess]]\n\n=== 1952 touring production ===\n[[Blevins Davis]] and Robert Breen produced a revival in 1952 which restored much of the music cut in the Crawford version, including many of the recitatives. It divided the opera into two acts, with the intermission occurring after Crown forces Bess to stay on Kittiwah Island. This version restored the work to a more operatic form, though not all of the recitatives were retained. In this version, ''Porgy and Bess'' was warmly received throughout Europe.<ref name=loc />{{failed verification|date=February 2020|reason=Nothing about the 1952 version there.}} The London premiere took place on October 9, 1952, at the [[Stoll Theatre]] where the opera continued until February 10, 1953.<ref>Martin, George: ''The Opera Companion to Twentieth Century Opera'' New York: Dodd, Meade & Company, 1979. pp. 389\u2013396.</ref>\n\nThis production's original cast featured Americans [[Leontyne Price]] as Bess, [[William Warfield]] as Porgy, and [[Cab Calloway]] as Sportin' Life, a role that Gershwin had composed with him in mind. The role of Clara was played by a young [[Maya Angelou]]. Price and Warfield met and wed while on the tour. The role of Porgy was the first for Warfield after his appearance as Joe, singing \"[[Ol' Man River]]\" in the popular 1951 [[MGM]] [[Show Boat (1951 film)|film of ''Show Boat'']].\n\nAfter a tour of Europe financed by the [[United States Department of State]], the production came to Broadway's [[Ziegfeld Theatre (1927)|Ziegfeld Theatre]] in March 1953. It later toured North America. After completing its North American run in Montreal, the company embarked on an international tour, with LeVern Hutcherson as Porgy and [[Gloria Davy]] as Bess.

A historic yet tense premiere took place in Moscow in December 1955; it was during the [[Cold War]] and the first time an American theater group had been to the Soviet capital since the [[October Revolution|Bolshevik Revolution]]. Author [[Truman Capote]] traveled with the cast and crew, and wrote an account included in his book ''[[The Muses Are Heard]]''.\n\n=== 1976 Houston Grand Opera production ===\nDuring the 1960s and early 1970s, ''Porgy and Bess'' mostly languished on the shelves, a victim of its perceived racism. Though new productions took place in 1961 and 1964, along with a [[Vienna Volksoper]] premiere in 1965 (again with William Warfield as Porgy), these did little to change many African Americans' opinions of the work. Many music critics still had not accepted it as a true opera.\n\nA new staging of ''Porgy and Bess'' was produced by the [[Houston Grand Opera]] in 1976 under music director [[John DeMain]]; it restored the complete original score for the first time. Following its debut in Houston, the production opened on Broadway at the [[Uris Theatre]] on September 25, 1976 and was recorded complete by [[RCA Records]]. This version was very influential in turning the tide of opinion about the work.\n\nFor the first time, an American opera company, not a Broadway production company, had tackled the opera. This production was based on Gershwin's original full score. It did not incorporate the cuts and other changes which Gershwin had made before the New York premiere, nor the ones made for the 1942 Cheryl Crawford revival or the [[#1959 film|1959 film version]]. It allowed the public to take in the operatic whole as first envisioned by the composer. In this light, ''Porgy and Bess'' was accepted as an opera. [[Donnie Ray Albert]] and [[Robert Mosley]] alternated performances in the role of Porgy. [[Clamma Dale]] and [[Larry Marshall (actor)|Larry Marshall]] starred, respectively, as Bess and Sportin' Life. This production won the Houston Grand Opera a [[Tony Award]]\u2014the only opera ever to receive one\u2014and a [[Grammy Award]]. The conductor was John DeMain.\n\n===Subsequent productions===\nAnother Broadway production was staged in 1983 at [[Radio City Music Hall]] with conductor [[C. William Harwood]], based on the Houston production.<ref>{{cite web|author=The Broadway League |url=http://www.ibdb.com/production.php?id=4861 |title=''Porgy and Bess'' &#124; IBDB: The official source for Broadway Information |publisher=IBDB |date= |accessdate=February 4, 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Metropolitan Opera]] finally presented a production of ''Porgy and Bess'' in 1985 after considering it since the 1930s. It opened February 6, 1985 with a cast including [[Simon Estes]], [[Grace Bumbry]], [[Bruce Hubbard]], Gregg Baker and [[Florence Quivar]]. The Met production was directed by [[Nathaniel Merrill]] and designed by [[Robert O'Hearn]]. The conductor was [[James Levine]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metoperafamily.org/metopera/history/ |title=Met History |publisher=The Metropolitan Opera|date= |accessdate=February 4, 2010}}</ref> The production received 16 performances in its first season and was revived in 1986, 1989 and 1990, for a total of 54 performances. After an absence of nearly thirty years on the Met stage, the company staged the new 2018 London production conducted by [[David Robertson (conductor)|David Robertson]] in Fall 2019.<ref>https://www.metopera.org/season/2019-20-season/porgy-and-bess/</ref><ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/music/met-opera-offers-a-porgy-of-its-time-that-speaks-to-ours/2019/09/24/0c73c756-de8e-11e9-be96-6adb81821e90_story.html Washington Post, ''Met Opera offers a Porgy of its time that speaks to ours'']</ref> It featured a cast including Golda Schultz, [[Latonia Moore]], [[Angel Blue]], [[Elizabeth Llewellyn]], [[Denyce Graves]], [[Eric Owens (bass-baritone)|Eric Owens]], Frederick Ballentine, Alfred Walker, and [[Ryan Speedo Green]].\n\n[[Trevor Nunn]] first tackled the work in an acclaimed 1986 production at England's [[Glyndebourne Festival]]. The 1986 Trevor Nunn production was scenically expanded and videotaped for television in 1993 (see below in \"Television\"). These productions were also based on the \"complete score,\" without incorporating Gershwin's revisions. A semi-staged version of this production was performed at [[the Proms]] in 1998.\n\nThe centennial celebration of the Gershwin brothers from 1996 to 1998 included a new production as well. On February 24\u201325, 2006, the [[Nashville Symphony]], under the direction of [[John Mauceri]], gave a [[Porgy and Bess (2006)|concert performance]] at the [[Tennessee Performing Arts Center]]. It incorporated Gershwin's cuts made for the New York premiere, thus giving the audience an idea of what the opera sounded like on its Broadway opening. In 2000 and 2002 the [[New York City Opera]] had a revival directed by [[Tazewell Thompson]]. In 2007, [[Los Angeles Opera]] staged a revival directed by Francesca Zambello and conducted by John DeMain, who led the history-making Houston Opera revival of ''Porgy and Bess'' in 1976.\n\nSouth Africa's [[Cape Town Opera]] has frequently performed ''Porgy and Bess'' abroad, most notably with the [[Welsh National Opera]], [[NorrlandsOperan]], [[Deutsche Oper Berlin]] and at the [[Wales Millennium Centre]], [[Royal Festival Hall]] and [[Edinburgh Festival Theatre]]. In October 2010, its planned tour of the opera to Israel was criticised by [[Desmond Tutu]].<ref>Cape Town Opera, [http://www.capetownopera.co.za/2010/10/27/cape-town-operas-tour-to-israel/ \"Cape Town Opera's Tour To Israel, Press release: 27 October 2010] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120605055626/http://www.capetownopera.co.za/2010/10/27/cape-town-operas-tour-to-israel/ |date=5 June 2012 }}</ref>\n\n=== 2006 ''The Gershwins' Porgy and Bess'' (Nunn adaptation) ===\n''The Gershwins' Porgy and Bess'' premiered on November 9, 2006, at the [[Savoy Theatre]] (London), directed by Trevor Nunn. (Although that was the title given to this production, the 1993 television adaptation of Nunn's 1986 production had also used it.) For this new production, he adapted the lengthy opera to fit the conventions of [[musical theatre]]. Working with the Gershwin and Heyward estates, Nunn used dialogue from the original novel and subsequent Broadway stage play to replace the [[recitative]]s with naturalistic scenes. He did not use operatic voices in this production, but relied on musical theatre actors as leads. [[Gareth Valentine]] provided the musical adaptation. Despite mostly positive reviews,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/6139588.stm |title=Press views: ''Porgy and Bess''|publisher=BBC News |accessdate=August 13, 2008|date=November 11, 2006}}</ref> Nunn's production closed months early due to poor box office.\n\nThis original cast of this version included [[Clarke Peters]] as Porgy, [[Nicola Hughes (actress)|Nicola Hughes]] as Bess, [[O.

Jasbo Brown entertains the community with his piano playing. Clara, a young mother, sings a lullaby to her baby (\"[[Summertime (George Gershwin song)|Summertime]]\") as the working men prepare for a game of [[craps]] (\"Roll them Bones\"). One of the players, Robbins, scorns his wife Serena's demands that he not play, retorting that on a Saturday night, a man has the right to play. Clara's husband, the fisherman Jake, tries his own lullaby (\"A Woman is a Sometime Thing\") with little effect. Little by little, other characters in the opera enter Catfish Row, among them Mingo, another fisherman, and Jim, a cotton-hauling [[stevedore]] who, tired of his job, decides to give it up and join Jake and the other fishermen. Porgy, a disabled beggar, enters on his goat cart to organize the game. Peter, an elderly \"honey man\" [honey vendor] returns, singing his vendor's call. Crown, a strong and brutal stevedore, storms in with his woman, Bess, and buys cheap whiskey and some \"[[cocaine|Happy Dust]]\" off the local dope peddler, Sportin' Life. Bess is shunned by the women of the community, especially the pious Serena and the matriarchal cookshop owner Maria, but Porgy softly defends her. The game begins. One by one, the players get crapped out, leaving only Robbins and Crown, who has become extremely drunk. When Robbins wins, Crown attempts to prevent him from taking his winnings. A brawl ensues, which ends when Crown stabs Robbins with Jim's cotton hook, killing him. Crown runs, telling Bess to fend for herself but that he will be back for her when the heat dies down. Sportin' Life gives her a dose of happy dust and offers to take her with him when he goes to New York, but she rejects him. He flees, and Bess begins to pound on doors, but is rejected by all of the residents of Catfish Row, with the exception of Porgy, who lets her in.\n\n''Scene 2: Serena's Room, the following night''\n\n[[File:PorgyandBessSerena-Glyndebourne.png|thumb|\"My Man's Gone Now\" sung by [[Cynthia Clarey]] in the [[Glyndebourne Festival Opera|Glyndebourne]] production (stage version)]]\nThe mourners sing a spiritual to Robbins (\"Gone, Gone, Gone\"). To raise money for his burial, a saucer is placed on his chest for the mourners' donations (\"Overflow\"). Bess enters with Porgy and attempts to donate to the burial fund, but Serena rejects her money until Bess explains that she is now living with Porgy. A white detective enters and coldly tells Serena that she must bury her husband the next day, or his body will be given to medical students (for [[dissection]]). He suddenly accuses Peter of Robbins's murder. Peter denies his guilt and says Crown was the murderer. The Detective orders Peter to be arrested as a [[material witness]], whom he will force to testify against Crown. Serena laments her loss in \"[[My Man's Gone Now]]\". The undertaker enters. The saucer holds only fifteen dollars of the needed twenty-five, but he agrees to bury Robbins as long as Serena promises to pay him back. Bess, who has been sitting in silence slightly apart from the rest of those gathered, suddenly begins to sing a gospel song and the chorus joyfully join in, welcoming her into the community. (\"Oh, the Train is at de Station\")\n\n=== Act 2 ===\n''Scene 1: Catfish Row, a month later, in the morning''\n\nJake and the other fishermen prepare for work (\"It take a long pull to get there\"). Clara asks Jake not to go because it is time for the annual storms, but he tells her that they desperately need the money. This causes Porgy to sing from his window about his new, happy-go-lucky outlook on life. (\"I got plenty o' nuttin\"). Sportin' Life waltzes around selling \"happy dust\", but soon incurs the wrath of Maria, who threatens him. (\"I hates yo' struttin' style\"). A fraudulent lawyer, Frazier, arrives and farcically divorces Bess from Crown. When he discovers Bess and Crown were not married, he raises his price from a dollar to a dollar and a half. Archdale, a white lawyer, enters and informs Porgy that Peter will soon be released. The bad omen of a buzzard flies over Catfish Row and Porgy demands that it leave now that he finally has found happiness. (\"Buzzard keep on flyin' over\".)\n\nAs the rest of Catfish Row prepares for the church picnic on nearby Kittiwah Island, Sportin' Life again offers to take Bess to New York with him; she refuses. He attempts to give her some \"happy dust\" despite her claims that she's given up drugs, but Porgy grabs his arm and scares him off. Sportin' Life leaves, reminding Bess as he goes that her men friends come and go, but he will be there all along. Bess and Porgy are now left alone, and express their love for each other (\"[[Bess, You Is My Woman Now]]\"). The chorus re-enters in high spirits as they prepare to leave for the picnic (\"Oh, I can't sit down\"). Bess is invited to the picnic by Maria, but she demurs as Porgy cannot come (due to his disability, he cannot get on the boat), but Maria insists. Bess leaves Porgy behind as they go off to the picnic. Porgy watches the boat leave (\"I got plenty o' nuttin\" reprise).\n\n''Scene 2: Kittiwah Island, that evening''\n\nThe chorus enjoys themselves at the picnic (\"I ain't got no shame\"). Sportin' Life presents the chorus his cynical views on the Bible (\"[[It Ain't Necessarily So]]\"), causing Serena to chastise them (\"Shame on all you sinners!\"). Everyone gets ready to leave. As Bess, who has lagged behind, tries to follow them, Crown emerges from the bushes. He reminds her that Porgy is \"temporary\" and laughs off her claims that she has been living decently now. Bess wants to leave Crown forever and attempts to make him forget about her (\"Oh, what you want wid Bess?\") but Crown refuses to give her up. He grabs her and will not let her go to the boat, which leaves without her, and then forcefully kisses her. He laughs at his conquest as her resistance begins to fail, and commands her to get into the woods, where his intentions are only too clear.\n\n''Scene 3: Catfish Row, a week later, just before dawn''\n\nA week later, Jake leaves to go fishing with his crew, one of whom observes that it looks as if a storm is coming in. Peter, still unsure of his crime, returns from prison. Meanwhile, Bess is lying in Porgy's room delirious with fever, which she has had ever since returning from Kittiwah Island. Serena prays to remove Bess's affliction (\"Oh, Doctor Jesus\"), and promises Porgy that Bess will be well by five o'clock. As the day passes, a strawberry woman, Peter (the Honey Man) and a crab man each pass by with their wares (\"Vendors' Trio\"). As the clock chimes five, Bess recovers from her fever. Porgy tells Bess that he knows she has been with Crown, and she admits that Crown has promised to return for her. Porgy tells her she is free to go if she wants to, and she tells him that although she wants to stay, she is afraid of Crown's hold on her. Porgy asks her what would happen if there was no Crown, and Bess tells Porgy she loves him and begs him to protect her. Porgy promises that she will never have to be afraid again (\"[[I Loves You, Porgy]]\").\n\nClara watches the water, fearful for Jake. Maria tries to allay her fears, but suddenly the hurricane bell begins to ring.\n\n''Scene 4: Serena's Room, dawn of the next day''\n\nThe residents of Catfish Row are all gathered in Serena's room for shelter from the hurricane. They drown out the sound of the storm with prayers and hymns (\"Oh, Doctor Jesus\") while Sportin' Life mocks their assumption that the storm is a signal of [[Judgment Day]]. Clara desperately sings her lullaby (\"Summertime\" [reprise]). A knock is heard at the door, and the chorus believes it to be Death (\"Oh there's somebody knocking at the door\"). Crown enters dramatically, having swum from Kittiwah Island, seeking Bess. He shows no fear of God, claiming that after the long struggle from Kittiwah, God and he are friends. The chorus tries to drown out his blaspheming with more prayer, and he taunts them by singing a vulgar song. (\"A red-headed woman\"). Suddenly, Clara sees Jake's boat float past the window, upside-down, and she runs out to try to save him, handing her baby to Bess. Bess asks that one of the men go out with her, and Crown taunts Porgy, who cannot go. Crown goes himself, yelling out as he leaves \"Alright, Big Friend! We're on for another Bout!\" The chorus continue to pray as the storm rises.\n\n=== Act 3 ===\n''Scene 1: Catfish Row, the next night''\n\nA group of women mourn Clara, Jake, and all of those who have been killed in the storm (\"Clara, Clara, don't you be downhearted\"). When they begin to mourn for Crown as well, Sportin' Life laughs at them and is told off by Maria. He insinuates that Crown may not be dead, and observes that when a woman has a man, maybe she's got him for keeps, but if she has ''two'' men, then it's highly likely she'll end up with none. Bess is heard singing Clara's lullaby to her baby, whom she is now taking care of. (\"Summertime\" [reprise]). Once Catfish Row is dark, Crown stealthily enters to claim Bess, but is confronted by Porgy. A fight ensues that ends when Porgy kills Crown. Porgy exclaims to Bess, \"You've got a man now. You've got Porgy!\"\n\n''Scene 2: Catfish Row, the next afternoon''\n\nThe detective enters and talks with Serena and her friends about the murders of Crown and Robbins. They deny knowledge of Crown's murder, frustrating the detective. Needing a witness for the coroner's inquest, he next questions an apprehensive Porgy. Once Porgy admits to knowing Crown, he is ordered to come and identify Crown's body. Sportin' Life tells Porgy that corpses bleed in the presence of their murderers, and the detective will use this to hang Porgy. Porgy refuses to identify the body, but is dragged off anyway. Bess is distraught, and Sportin' Life puts his plan into action. He tells her that Porgy will be locked up for a long time, and points out that he is the only one still here. He offers her happy dust, and though she refuses, he forces it on her. After she takes a whiff, he paints a seductive picture of her life with him in New York (\"There's a boat dat's leavin' soon for New York\"). She regains her strength and rushes inside, slamming the door on his face, but he leaves a packet of happy dust on her doorstep, and settles down to wait.\n\n''Scene 3: Catfish Row, a week later''\n\nOn a beautiful morning, Porgy is released from jail, where he has been arrested for contempt of court after refusing to look at Crown's body. He returns to Catfish Row much richer after playing craps with his cellmates. He gives gifts to the residents, and pulls out a beautiful red dress for Bess. He does not understand why everyone seems so uneasy at his return. He sees Clara's baby is now with Serena and realizes something is wrong. He asks where Bess is. Maria and Serena tell him that Bess has run off with Sportin' Life to New York (\"Oh Bess, Oh Where's my Bess?\"). Porgy calls for his goat cart, and resolves to leave Catfish Row to find her. He prays for strength, and begins his journey. (\"Oh, Lawd, I'm on my way\")\n\n== Racial controversy ==\nFrom the outset, the opera's depiction of [[African Americans]] attracted controversy. [[Virgil Thomson]], a white American composer, stated that \"Folklore subjects recounted by an outsider are only valid as long as the folk in question is unable to speak for itself, which is certainly not true of the American Negro in 1935.\"<ref>[[Virgil Thomson|Thomson, Virgil]] in ''Modern Music'', November\u2013December 1935. pp. 16\u201317.</ref> An apocryphal quote attributed to [[Duke Ellington]] allegedly stated \"the times are here to debunk Gershwin's lampblack Negroisms,\u201d but the quote was probably invented by a journalist who interviewed Ellington about the opera. Ellington publicly repudiated the article shortly after its publication.<ref>{{cite book|first=Howard|last=Pollack|title=George Gershwin|publisher=University of California Press|year=2006|isbn=978-0-520-24864-9|p=167|ref=harv}}</ref> Ellington's response to the 1952 Breen revival was completely the opposite. His telegram to the producer read: \"Your ''Porgy and Bess'' the superbest, singing the gonest, acting the craziest, Gershwin the greatest.\"<ref>Hutchisson, James M. ''DuBose Heyward: A Charleston Gentleman and the World of \"Porgy and Bess.\"'' University of Mississippi Press (2000), {{ISBN|978-1-57806-250-8}}, 165.</ref> Several of the members of the original cast later stated that they, too, had concerns that their characters might play into a [[stereotype]] that African Americans lived in poverty, took drugs and solved their problems with their fists.\n\nA planned production by the Negro Repertory Company of Seattle in the late 1930s, part of the [[Federal Theatre Project]], was cancelled because actors were displeased with what they viewed as a [[racism|racist]] portrayal of aspects of African-American life. The director initially envisioned that they would perform the play in a \"[[Negro]] [[dialect]].\" These [[Pacific Northwest]] African American actors, who did not speak in such dialect, would be coached in it. Florence James attempted a compromise of dropping the use of dialect but the production was canceled.<ref>Becker, Paula. \"[http://www.historylink.org/output.cfm?file_id=3976 \"Negro Repertory Company\"] on HistoryLink.org, November 10, 2002.</ref>\n\nAnother production of ''Porgy and Bess'', this time at the [[University of Minnesota]] in 1939, ran into similar troubles. According to Barbara Cyrus, one of the few black students then at the university, members of the local African-American community saw the play as \"detrimental to the race\" and as a vehicle that promoted racist stereotypes. The play was cancelled due to pressure from the African-American community, which saw their success as proof of the increasing political power of blacks in [[Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul]].<ref>Brady, Tim, [http://www.alumni.umn.edu/The_Way_Spaces_Were_Allocated__African_Americans_on_Campus__Part_II.html \"The Way Spaces Were Allocated: African Americans on Campus, Part II\"], ''Minnesota'', November\u2013December 2002, University of Minnesota Alumni Association.</ref>\n\nThe belief that ''Porgy and Bess'' was racist gained strength during the [[Civil Rights Movement]] and [[Black Power movement]] of the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s. As these movements advanced, ''Porgy and Bess'' was seen as more and more out of date. When the play was revived in the 1960s, social critic and African-American educator [[Harold Cruse]] called it, \"The most incongruous, contradictory cultural symbol ever created in the Western World.\"<ref name=JS>Standifer, James, [https://web.archive.org/web/20050211025941/https://www.neh.gov/news/humanities/1997-11/porgy.html \"The Complicated Life of ''Porgy and Bess''\"], ''Humanities'', November/December 1997, Volume 18, Number 6</ref>\n\nIn the 1976 Houston Opera production, the director, Sherwin Goldman, had trouble finding interested performers. Goldman, a white Texas native and a graduate of Yale and Oxford Universities, recalled, \"I was auditioning singers all around the country, I guess thirty cities in all, from theater groups to church choirs, but was having a hard time finding directors ... I don't think there was a single black person, of those who had never been associated with Porgy, who didn't seriously bad-mouth it.\" Nevertheless, a cast was assembled of African American classically trained performers from all around the country.<ref>{{cite book|last=Albert|first=H.|title=The Life and Times of 'Porgy and Bess'|date=1990|publisher=Knopf|page=298}}</ref>\n\nGershwin's all-black opera was also unpopular with some celebrated black artists. [[Harry Belafonte]] declined to play Porgy in the late 1950s film version, so the role went to [[Sidney Poitier]]. Betty Allen, president of [[The Harlem School of the Arts]], admittedly loathed the piece, and [[Grace Bumbry]], who excelled in the 1985 Metropolitan Opera production as Bess, made the often cited statement: <blockquote>I thought it beneath me, I felt I had worked far too hard, that we had come far too far to have to retrogress to 1935. My way of dealing with it was to see that it was really a piece of [[Americana]], of American history, whether we liked it or not.

Some black singers were overjoyed at Gershwin's work, going so far as to describe him as the \"Abraham Lincoln of Negro music\".{{sfn|Pollack|2006|pp=597\u201398}} Much of the racial controversy seems to arise from the miscegenation of Gershwin's jazz experience. Gershwin wrote Porgy through an idiom of jazz that was influenced by Western European opera traditions, African-American music, and Russian-Jewish music.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ross|first=Alex|authorlink=Alex Ross (music critic)|title=The Rest Is Noise|pages=[https://archive.org/details/restisnoiseliste00ross/page/147 147\u2013150]|year=2007|publisher=[[Farrar, Straus and Giroux]]|isbn=9780374249397|title-link=The Rest Is Noise}}</ref>\n\nDuring the era of [[apartheid in South Africa]], several South African theatre companies planned to put on all-white productions of ''Porgy and Bess''. [[Ira Gershwin]], as heir to his brother, consistently refused to permit these productions to be staged. But in 2009, [[Cape Town Opera]]'s production, set in 1970s South Africa and inspired by life in [[Soweto]], toured Britain, opening at the [[Wales Millennium Centre]] in Cardiff and going on to the [[Royal Festival Hall]] in London and [[Edinburgh Festival Theatre]]. Most of the cast were black South Africans; American singers involved in the production have found the \"passionate identification with the opera\" by the South African singers \"a wake-up call\".\n\n{{quote|\"I think we've got a little jaded in the US with ''Porgy and Bess'',\" says Lisa Daltirus, one of two singers who will play Bess on the UK tour. \"A lot of people just think that this is a show that is lovely to listen to and happened way back when.

While the opera was presented in the context of the [[Refugees of the Syrian Civil War|Syrian migrant crisis]] (moved from Catfish Row to an airport), the controversy of recasting continued. While the Hungarian State Opera, in discussions with the [[Tams-Witmark Music Library]] originally agreed to the casting requirements, it ultimately declined to do so when the wording was not included in the written contract. This production galvanized conservative commentators who lauded it as a success over \"political correctness\". Ultimately, Tams-Witmark required the Hungarian State Opera to include in its printed material that this production \"is contrary to the requirements for the presentation of this work\".<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/30/arts/music/progy-and-bess-white-cast-budapest.html \"''Porgy and Bess'' With a White Cast Stirs Controversy\"] by Alexandra Ivanoff, ''[[The New York Times]]'', 30 January 2018</ref>\n\n== Musical elements ==\nIn the summer of 1934, George Gershwin worked on the opera in [[Charleston, South Carolina]]. He drew inspiration from the James Island [[Gullah]] community, which he felt had preserved some African musical traditions. This research added to the authenticity of his work.<ref>Ewen, David, ''The Home Book of 20th Century Music'', Arco, 1956, p. 138</ref>\n\nThe music itself reflects his New York jazz roots, but also draws on southern black traditions. Gershwin modeled the pieces after each type of [[folk song]] which the composer knew about; jubilees, [[blues]], praying songs, street cries, work songs, and spirituals are blended with traditional [[aria]]s and [[recitative]]s.<ref name=JS />\n\nThe most fundamental influences on the composition and orchestrations in evidence throughout ''Porgy and Bess'', aside from those of American Jazz and Black religious music, are the European composers whose music Gershwin studied and absorbed during his tutelage with the likes of [[Edward Kilenyi]], [[Rubin Goldmark]], [[Charles Hambitzer]], and [[Henry Cowell]].<ref>unconservatory.org</ref> Cowell's key contribution, however, may have been to suggest that Gershwin study with [[Joseph Schillinger]],{{sfn|Pollack|2006|p=127}} whose influence, if not as important as his followers claim, is notable throughout. Some commenters have believed they heard simililarities to melodies heard in [[Jewish music|Jewish liturgical music]] in Gershwin's opera. Gershwin biographer [[Edward Jablonski]] heard a similarity between the melody of \"It Ain't Necessarily So\" and the [[Haftarah#Haftarah cantillation|Haftarah blessing]],<ref>{{harvnb|Jablonski|1987}}), cited in Benaroya, Adam (May 2000) [http://www.ilperetz.org/graduates/adam_benaroya.htm \"The Jewish Roots in George Gershwin's Music\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051214125934/http://ilperetz.org/graduates/adam_benaroya.htm |date=2005-12-14 }}, I.L.

Many of these represent individual characters: some of these are fragments of the opera's set numbers (Sportin' Life, for example, is frequently represented by the melody which sets the title words of \"It Ain't Necessarily So\"). Other motifs represent objects (such as the sleazy chromatic \"Happy Dust\" motif) or places, notably Catfish Row. Many of the through-composed passages of the score combine or develop these leitmotifs in order to reflect the on-stage action. Particularly sophisticated uses of this techniques can be seen after the aria \"There's a boat dat's leaving soon for New York\" in act 3, scene 2. The opera also frequently reprises its set numbers (these might be considered extended ''Leitsektionen''). Notable in this respect are the reprises of \"Bess, you is my woman now\" and \"I got plenty o' nuttin' \" which conclude act 2, scene 1. The song \"[[Summertime (George Gershwin song)|Summertime]]\" is stated four times alone.\n\nThe duration of the work is about 180 minutes.\n\n===Instrumentation===\nThe work is scored for two [[Western concert flute|flutes]] (second doubling [[piccolo]]), two [[oboe]]s (second doubling [[English horn]]), three [[clarinet]]s in B-flat (second and third doubling [[alto saxophone]]s), one [[bass clarinet]] in B-flat (doubling fourth clarinet and [[tenor saxophone]]), one [[bassoon]]; three [[French horn]]s in F, three [[trumpet]]s in B-flat, one [[trombone]], one [[bass trombone]], one [[tuba]]; a percussion section that includes [[timpani]], [[xylophone]], [[triangle (musical instrument)|triangle]], [[glockenspiel]], suspended and crash [[cymbal]]s, [[snare drum]], [[tom-tom]]s, [[bass drum]], African drums, an unspecified small drum, [[tubular bells]], [[Woodblock (instrument)|wood block]], [[temple block]]s, cowbell, [[sandpaper]] and [[train whistle]]; one [[piano]]; and [[string section|strings]].<ref>{{cite book|last= Gershwin|first= George|title= Porgy and Bess|publisher= Schott|year= 1935}}</ref>\n\n== Recordings ==\n{{Main|Porgy and Bess discography}}\n\nThe 1976 and 1977 recordings of the opera won Grammy Awards for [[Best Opera Recording]], making ''Porgy and Bess'' the only opera to win this award over two consecutive years.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/awards/winners-nominees/106|title=Winners|work=GRAMMY.com|access-date=2018-01-30|language=en}}</ref>\n\n=== Excerpts ===\nDays after the Broadway premiere of ''Porgy and Bess'' with an all-black cast, two white opera singers, [[Lawrence Tibbett]] and [[Helen Jepson]], both members of the [[Metropolitan Opera]], recorded highlights of the opera in a New York sound studio,<ref>[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001BIKQBI Amazon.com: ''Porgy and Bess'' (Selections): Act 2: It Ain't Necessarily So (1998 Remastered): Lawrence Tibbett: MP3 Downloads<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> released as ''[[Highlights from Porgy and Bess]]''.\n\nMembers of the original cast were not recorded until 1940, when [[Todd Duncan]] and [[Anne Brown]] recorded selections from the work. Two years later, when the first Broadway revival occurred, American [[Decca Records|Decca]] rushed other members of the cast into the recording studio to record other selections not recorded in 1940. These two albums were marketed as a two-volume 78 rpm set ''[[Selections from George Gershwin's Folk Opera Porgy and Bess]]''.

[[Louis Armstrong]] and [[Ella Fitzgerald]] recorded [[Porgy and Bess (Ella Fitzgerald and Louis Armstrong album)|an album in 1957]] in which they sang and scatted Gershwin's tunes. The next year, [[Miles Davis]] recorded what some consider a [[Porgy and Bess (Miles Davis album)|seminal interpretation]] of the opera arranged for [[big band]].\n\nIn 1959, [[Columbia Masterworks Records]] released a soundtrack album of Samuel Goldwyn's film version of ''Porgy and Bess'', which had been made that year. It was not a complete version of the opera, nor was it even a complete version of the film soundtrack, which featured more music than could be contained on a single LP. The album remained in print until the early 1970s, when it was withdrawn from stores at the request of the Gershwin estate. It is the first stereo album of music from ''Porgy and Bess'' with an all-black cast. However, according to the album [[liner notes]], [[Sammy Davis Jr.]] was under contract to another recording company, and his vocal tracks for the film could not be used on the album. [[Cab Calloway]] substituted his own vocals of Sportin' Life's songs. [[Robert McFerrin]] was the singing voice of Porgy, and [[Adele Addison]] the singing voice of Bess. The white singer [[Loulie Jean Norman]] was the singing voice of Clara (portrayed onscreen by [[Diahann Carroll]]), and [[Inez Matthews]] the singing voice of Serena (portrayed onscreen by [[Ruth Attaway]]).\n\nIn 1963, [[Leontyne Price]] and [[William Warfield]], who had starred in the 1952 world tour of ''Porgy and Bess'', recorded their own album of excerpts from the opera for [[RCA Victor]]. None of the other singers from that production appeared on that album, but [[John W. Bubbles]], the original Sportin' Life, substituted for Cab Calloway (who had played Sportin' Life onstage in the 1952 production).<ref>[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00000I9MJ Amazon.com: Porgy & Bess: High Performance: William Warfield, John W. Bubbles, Leontyne Price: Music<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The 1963 recording of ''Porgy and Bess'' excerpts remains the only official recording of the score on which Bubbles sings Sportin' Life's two big numbers.\n\nIn, 1976, for RCA Victor, [[Ray Charles]] and [[Cleo Laine]] recorded an album of excerpts in which the two of them sang several roles. The album was arranged and conducted by [[Frank De Vol]]. It featured the organ of [[Joe Sample]], the trumpet of [[Harry Edison]] and guitar work of [[Joe Pass]] and [[Lee Ritenour]]. It was jazz-based with full orchestrations, but the orchestrations used were not Gershwin's.\n\nIn 1990, [[Leonard Slatkin]] conducted an album of excerpts from the opera, released on a [[Philips Records]] CD, with Simon Estes (who sang Porgy in the first Metropolitan Opera production of the work) and Roberta Alexander.\n\n=== Complete recordings ===\n* 1951: [[Columbia Masterworks]]: the company recorded a 3-LP album of what was then the standard performing version of ''Porgy and Bess'' \u2013 the most complete recording made of the opera up to that time. It was billed as a \"complete\" version, but was complete only insofar as that was the way the work was usually performed then. (Actually, nearly an hour was cut from the opera.) Because album producer [[Goddard Lieberson]] was eager to bring as much of ''Porgy and Bess'' as he felt was practical on records at the time, the recording featured more of Gershwin's original recitatives and orchestrations than had ever been heard before. The recording was conducted by [[Lehman Engel]], and starred [[Lawrence Winters]] and [[Camilla Williams]], both from the [[New York City Opera]]. Several singers who had been associated with the original 1935 production and the 1942 revival of ''Porgy and Bess'' were finally given a chance to record their roles more or less complete. The album was highly acclaimed as a giant step in recorded opera in its time. It was re-released at budget price on the Odyssey label in the early 1970s. It has subsequently appeared on CD on Sony's \"Masterworks Heritage\" CD series, and on the Naxos label as well. The album is not sung in as directly \"operatic\" a style as later versions, treading a fine line between opera and musical theatre.\n* 1952: [[Guild (CD label)|Guild]] (not released until 2008): A live recording of a September 21, 1952, performance of ''Porgy and Bess'', starring Leontyne Price, William Warfield, Cab Calloway and the rest of the cast of the 1952 Davis-Breen revival. This is the only known recording of an actual performance made from the historic and highly acclaimed 1952 world tour of the opera. While the opera itself is not performed truly complete, it is a complete recording of that specific performance. [[Alexander Smallens]], who led the original 1935 production and the 1942 revival, conducts. Some of the sung recitatives are still performed as spoken dialogue in the production.\n* 1956: [[Bethlehem Records]]: A version of the opera more heavily oriented toward jazz than the original.

It starred [[Willard White]] singing his first Porgy, and [[Leona Mitchell]] as Bess. The recording was praised by critics for its performance quality and racial significance, but at the same time was highly criticized by some{{By whom|date=October 2014}} for not bringing out the \"jazzier\" qualities of the score.\n* 1977: RCA Victor: A complete recording of the opera by the [[Houston Grand Opera]] based on the complete original score.\n* 1989: [[EMI]]: [[Porgy and Bess (Glyndebourne album)|The Glyndebourne album]] also based on the complete original score, without Gershwin's cuts.<ref>Music was played by the [[London Philharmonic Orchestra]] and conducted by [[Simon Rattle]].

The musical cuts made on this album coincide almost exactly with those in the 1951 album, with the exception that \"The Buzzard Song\", usually cut in early productions, is heard on the 1951 album, and the \"Occupational Humoresque\", heard on the 2006 album, is not heard on the 1951 album at all. This version stars [[Marquita Lister]] as Bess.\n* 2010: RCA Victor: [[Nikolaus Harnoncourt]], an unusual choice for this Gershwin opera, conducted a recording of an almost complete ''Porgy and Bess'', which was released in the U.S. in September 2010. Gregg Baker, who sang Crown in the 1985 Metropolitan Opera production, the 1986 Glyndebourne production, the 1989 EMI recording made with the Glyndebourne cast, and in the 1993 television adaptation of that production, repeated his performance here, but the roles of Porgy and Bess are taken by two singers virtually unknown in the U.S., [[Jonathan Lemalu]] and [[Isabelle Kabatu]].\n* 2014: EuroArts Music International: DVD and Blu-ray recorded live by [[San Francisco Opera]] in June 2009, with [[Eric Owens (bass-baritone)|Eric Owens]] and [[Laquita Mitchell]] in the title roles.<ref>Janos Gereben, [https://www.sfcv.org/article/porgy-amp-bess-on-dvd-and-blu-ray \"''Porgy and Bess'' on DVD and Blu-Ray\"], ''San Francisco Classical Voice'' on sfcv.org</ref>\n\n== Adaptations ==\n\n=== Film ===\n\n====1959 film====\n[[File:Porgy and Bess (1959 film poster).jpg|thumb|upright|Poster for the 1959 film version]]\nA [[Porgy and Bess (film)|1959 film version]], produced in 70&nbsp;mm [[Todd-AO]] by [[Samuel Goldwyn]], was plagued with problems. Rouben Mamoulian, who had directed the 1935 Broadway premiere, was hired to direct the film, but was subsequently fired in favor of director [[Otto Preminger]] after a disagreement with the producer. Mamoulian urged making the film on location in [[South Carolina]] after a fire on the sound stage destroyed the film's sets. Goldwyn, who never liked making films on location, considered Mamoulian's request a sign of disloyalty.{{sfn|Marx|1976|p={{page needed|date=July 2019}}}} [[Robert McFerrin]] dubbed the singing voice for [[Sidney Poitier]]'s Porgy as did [[Adele Addison]] for [[Dorothy Dandridge]]'s Bess. [[Ruth Attaway]]'s Serena and [[Diahann Carroll]]'s Clara were also dubbed. Although Dandridge and Carroll were singers, their voices were not considered operatic enough. [[Sammy Davis Jr.]], [[Brock Peters]] and [[Pearl Bailey]] (who played Sportin' Life, Crown and Maria, respectively) were the only principals who provided their own singing. [[Andr\u00e9 Previn]]'s adaptation of the score won him an [[Academy Award]], the film's only Oscar.\n\nThe Gershwin estate was disappointed with the film, as the score was substantially edited to make it more like a [[musical theatre|musical]]. Much of the music was omitted from the film, and many of Gershwin's orchestrations were either changed or completely scrapped. It was shown on [[network television]] in the U.S. only once, in 1967. Critics attacked it for not being faithful to Gershwin's opera, for over-refining the language grammatically, and for its \"overblown\" staging. The film was removed from release in 1974 by the Gershwin estate. In 2011, it was selected to the U.S. [[National Film Registry]].\n\n[[Mike Medavoy]] and Bobby Geisler announced in 2019 that they are developing a re-envisioned and updated film version with the approval of the Gershwin estate.<ref>{{cite web|last=McNary|first=Dave|title=''Porgy and Bess'': Gershwins' Opera Gets Film Update (Exclusive)|url=https://variety.com/2013/film/news/porgy-and-bess-movie-1200333773/|date=5 April 2013|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|access-date=21 May 2019}}</ref><ref>{{IMDb title|tt10361964|Porgy and Bess|(in development)}}</ref>\n\n====Other films====\nThe 1945 [[Warner Bros.]] film biography of Gershwin, ''[[Rhapsody in Blue (film)|Rhapsody in Blue]]'', featured an extended musical scene recreating the opening of the original Broadway production of ''Porgy and Bess''. Included was the original Bess, Anne Brown, recreating her performance. The scene includes a more elaborate (and historically inaccurate) arrangement for the film of the song \"Summertime\", sung by Anne Brown as Bess with full chorus, but the Catfish Row set design is a virtual duplicate of the one seen in the 1935 Broadway stage production.\n\nThe 1985 film ''[[White Nights (1985 film)|White Nights]]'' featured a scene in which [[Gregory Hines]] performed \"There's a Boat Dat's Leavin' Soon for New York\" as Sportin' Life. Hines' rendition, before a Siberian audience, included a [[tap dance|tap dancing]] sequence. Director [[Taylor Hackford]] pointed out in a special edition DVD release of the film that it was necessary to locate a Russian woman of color (Helene Denbey) to portray Bess, as per Gershwin's stipulations.\n\n=== Television ===\nIn 1993, Trevor Nunn's Glyndebourne Festival stage production of ''Porgy and Bess'', not to be confused with his later production, was greatly expanded scenically and [[videotape]]d in a [[television]] studio without an audience. This first Nunn production was also called ''The Gershwins' 'Porgy and Bess' '' when shown on television. It was telecast by the BBC in England and by PBS in the United States. It featured a cast of operatic American singers, with the exception of Willard White, who is Jamaican but sounded American, as Porgy. [[Cynthia Haymon]] sang the role of Bess. Nunn's \"opening up\" of the stage production was considered highly imaginative; his cast received much critical praise,<ref>{{cite news|last=Porterfield |first=Christopher |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,979313,00.html |title=Conjuring Up Catfish Row |publisher=TIME |date=October 4, 1993|accessdate=February 4, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE1DB163AF935A35753C1A965958260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=2 |title=Review/Television; Two Law Series Return, With Some Revisions|work=The New York Times |date=October 6, 1993|accessdate=February 4, 2010 | first=John J. | last=O'Connor}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://homevideo.about.com/od/dvdreviewslong/a/PorgyBessDVDMoa.htm |title=Porgy & Bess Movie DVD Review \u2013 About.com |publisher=Homevideo.about.com |date= |accessdate=February 4, 2010}}</ref> and the three-hour production retained nearly all of Gershwin's music, heard in the original 1935 orchestrations. This included the opera's sung recitatives, which have occasionally been turned into spoken dialogue in other productions. No extra dialogue was written for this production, as had been done in the 1959 film. All performers lip-synched rather than singing live on set, leading ''[[The New York Times]]'' to write: \"What you hear is basically Mr. Nunn's acclaimed Glyndebourne Festival production, the original cast intact. What you see was filmed later in a London studio. The performers, some new to the production, are lip-synching. It's as if an elaborate visual aid had been concocted for the EMI recording.\"\n\nThis ''Porgy and Bess'' production was subsequently released on [[VHS]] and [[DVD]]. It has won far greater acclaim than the 1959 film, which was widely panned by most critics. The 1993 television production of ''Porgy and Bess'' was nominated for four [[Emmy Award]]s, and won for its [[art direction]].<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107854/awards ''Porgy and Bess'' (1993) (TV) \u2013 Awards<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> It also won a [[BAFTA]] Award for Best Video Lighting.<ref>[http://www.bafta.org/awards-database.html?sq=Porgy+and+Bess Awards Database \u2013 The BAFTA site<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nIn 2002, the [[New York City Opera]] telecast its new version of the Houston Opera production, in a live performance from the stage of [[Lincoln Center]]. This version featured far more cuts than the previous telecast, but, like nearly all stage versions produced since 1976, used the sung recitatives and Gershwin's orchestrations. The telecast also included interviews with director [[Tazewell Thompson]] and was hosted by [[Beverly Sills]].\n\nIn 2009 the San Francisco Opera debuted the Gershwins' ''Porgy and Bess'' to critical acclaim. The production was recorded at that time and shown on PBS in the fall of 2014, and was later released on [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray]].\n\n=== Radio ===\nOn December 1, 1935, during the Broadway run, Todd Duncan and Anne Brown performed \"Summertime\", \"I Got Plenty o' Nuttin'\" and \"Bess, You Is My Woman Now\" on NBC's ''[[The Magic Key of RCA]]'' radio program. Duncan and Brown also appeared on the 1937 CBS Gershwin memorial concert on September 8, 1937, broadcast from the [[Hollywood Bowl]] less than two months after the composer's death, along with several other members of the Broadway cast, including [[John W. Bubbles]] and [[Ruby Elzy]]. They performed several selections from the opera.\n\nThe complete ''Porgy and Bess'' has been broadcast by the Metropolitan Opera three times as part of the [[Metropolitan Opera radio broadcasts|Met's live radio broadcast series]]. The 1985 broadcast performance starred [[Simon Estes]] and [[Grace Bumbry]].<ref>http://archives.metoperafamily.org/archives/frame.htm</ref> In 1986 Ms. Bumbry was heard with Robert Mosley as Porgy. In 1990, Estes and [[Leona Mitchell]] sang the leads in the third broadcast.\n\n=== Concert ===\nGershwin prepared an orchestral suite containing music from the opera after ''Porgy and Bess'' closed early on Broadway. Though it was originally titled \"Suite from ''Porgy and Bess''\", Ira later renamed it ''[[Catfish Row]]''.\n\nIn 1942 [[Robert Russell Bennett]] arranged a medley (rather than a suite) for orchestra which has often been heard in the concert hall, known as ''[[Porgy and Bess: A Symphonic Picture]]''. It is based on Gershwin's original scoring, though for a slightly different instrumentation (the piano was removed from the orchestral texture at the request of the conductor [[Fritz Reiner]], for whom the arrangement was made). [[Morton Gould]] also arranged an orchestral suite in the 1950s.\n\nBennett's 40-minute ''Porgy and Bess'', a concert version for soprano and baritone soloists, chorus and orchestra was prepared in 1956. It is based very closely on Gershwin's original instrumental and vocal scoring, the principal recasting being the use of standard concert-orchestra instrumentation, eliminating the clarinet-saxophone doubling specified in Gershwin's 1935 orchestration.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}\n\n=== Piano ===\nIn 1951, Australian-born composer [[Percy Grainger]], who was an admirer, performer and arranger of Gershwin's music, completed a twenty-minute piece for two pianos titled ''Fantasy on George Gershwin's \"Porgy and Bess\"''.\n\nThe pianist [[Earl Wild]] prepared a virtuoso piano arrangement in the manner of [[Franz Liszt]], entitled ''Fantasy on Gershwin's \"Porgy & Bess\"''.\n\n=== Brass quintet version ===\n* In 1987 the [[Canadian Brass]] commissioned Luther Henderson to create an arrangement of Porgy and Bess music for an RCA Red Seal recording release \"Strike Up The Band\". The printed version then became available to performers from Hal Leonard Publishing Corp.\n\n=== Jazz versions ===\n* [[Miles Davis]] and [[Gil Evans]] recorded [[Porgy and Bess (Miles Davis album)|jazz arrangements of ''Porgy and Bess'']].

The album was released on Riviera, and re-released by [[Universal Music|Universal]] in 2000 as part of their ''Jazz in Paris'' series.{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n* In 1997, saxophonist [[Joe Henderson]] recorded jazz arrangements on the album ''[[Porgy & Bess (Joe Henderson album)|Porgy & Bess]]'' with the participation of several eminent jazz musicians.\n\n== Songs ==\n''Porgy and Bess'' contains many songs that have become popular in their own right, becoming standards in jazz and blues in addition to their original operatic setting.\n\nSome of the most popular songs are:\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em|rules=yes}}\n* \"[[Summertime (George Gershwin song)|Summertime]]\", act 1, scene 1\n* \"A Woman Is a Sometime Thing\", act 1, scene 1\n* \"[[My Man's Gone Now]]\", act 1, scene 2\n* \"It Take a Long Pull to Get There\", act 2, scene 1\n* \"[[I Got Plenty o' Nuttin']]\", act 2, scene 1\n* \"Buzzard Keep on Flyin'\", act 2, scene 1\n* \"[[Bess, You Is My Woman Now]]\", act 2, scene 1\n* \"Oh, I Can't Sit Down,\" act 2, scene 1\n* \"[[It Ain't Necessarily So]]\", act 2, scene 2\n* \"What You Want Wid Bess\", act 2, scene 2\n* \"Oh, Doctor Jesus\", act 2, scene 3\n* \"[[I Loves You, Porgy]]\", act 2, scene 3\n* \"A Red-Haired Woman\", act 2, scene 4\n* \"There's a Boat Dat's Leavin' Soon for New York\", act 3, scene 2\n* \"Bess, O Where's My Bess?\", act 3, scene 3\n* \"O Lawd, I'm on My Way\", act 3, scene 3\n{{Div col end}}\n\nSome of the more celebrated renditions of these songs include [[Sarah Vaughan]]'s \"[[It Ain't Necessarily So]]\" and the versions of \"[[Summertime (George Gershwin song)|Summertime]]\" recorded by [[Billie Holiday]], [[Porgy and Bess (Ella Fitzgerald and Louis Armstrong album)|Ella Fitzgerald and Louis Armstrong]], [[Porgy and Bess (Miles Davis album)|Miles Davis]], [[John Coltrane]], and [[Jascha Heifetz]] in his own transcriptions for violin and piano.\n\nNumerous other musicians have recorded \"Summertime\" in varying styles, including both instrumental and vocal recordings; it may be even the most popular [[cover version|cover]] song in popular music.\n* [[Janis Joplin]] recorded a [[Blues rock]] version of \"Summertime\" with [[Big Brother and the Holding Company]]. [[Billy Stewart]]'s version became a [[Top 40|Top 10]] [[Pop music|Pop]] and [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] hit in 1966 for [[Chess Records]].\n* Even seemingly unlikely performers such as [[The Zombies]] (1965) or the [[ska punk]] band [[Sublime (band)|Sublime]] (as \"[[Doin' Time]]\", 1997) have made recordings of \"Summertime\". An international group of collectors of recordings of \"Summertime\" by the name \"The Summertime Connection\" claims more than 30,000 recorded performances (many live) in their collection.<ref>{{cite web|last=Klaver|first=Wilfred |title=The Summertime Connection|url=http://members.quicknet.nl/edclusa/index.html|publisher=The Summertime Connection|accessdate=3 September 2010}}</ref><ref>[http://www.summertime-connection.nl/ST%20Coverlist.pdf Summertime Connection list]</ref>\n* [[Nina Simone]] recorded several ''Porgy and Bess'' songs.

It was unusual in that it was recorded in a major key rather than Gershwin's minor key.\n\n== Commendations ==\nOn July 14, 1993, the [[United States Postal Service]] recognized the opera's cultural significance by issuing a [[Postage stamps and postal history of the United States|commemorative 29-cent postage stamp]].\n\nIn 2001, ''Porgy and Bess'' was proclaimed the official opera of the state of South Carolina.<ref>Edger, Walter.

Khiem was a cargo pilot with the 53rd Tactical Wing of the 5th Air Division stationed at [[Tan Son Nhut Air Base|Tan Son Nhut]]. Khiem flew several missions into communists gained [[Pleiku Air Base|Pleiku]] in hopes to rescue VNAF personnel. On 03 April 1975, Khiem organized a plan to steal a C-130a and gather 53 people to rescue them from the communist [[North Vietnam|North Vietnamese]]. Later, Khiem became a pilot for [[Piedmont Airlines (1948\u20131989)|Piedmont Airlines]] until 2006.\n\n== Early Life ==\n[[File:Pham_Family_1960.jpg|alt=|left|thumb|190x190px|Pham family in 1960.]]\nPham Quang Khiem was born on December 27, 1946, in [[V\u0129nh Long|V\u0129nh-Long, Vietnam]]. Khiem had ten siblings (five boys and five girls) and all of his brothers were in the military. Three of them were in the VNAF and one in the [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam|ARVN]]. Khiem got married on June 8, 1972, to Ngoc-My Tran. Together they had three children: two in South Vietnam and one in the [[United States|United States of America]].\n\n== Early Career ==\n[[File:Pham_Quang_Khiem_at_Lockbourne_AFB.jpg|alt=|left|thumb|195x195px|Pham Quang Khiem at Lockbourne AFB]]\n<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://t28trojanfoundation.com/vnaf.html|title=VNAF|website=Helen Murphy|language=en|access-date=2020-04-06}}</ref>In November 1969, Khiem went to [[Lackland Air Force Base|Lackland AFB]] to learn [[English language|English]] as a VNAF air cadet. At [[Randolph Air Force Base|Randolph AFB]], he earned his basic pilot training, then moved on to [[Keesler Air Force Base|Keesler AFB]], where he flew the [[T-28 Trojan]].\u00a0Khiem also trained at [[Lockbourne AFB]] from October-December of 1970. Eventually, he was designated to fly transport aircraft and was pilot-in-command of [[C-123K]] aircraft before moving up to the 53rd Tactical Wing, 435th Transport Squadron as a [[Lockheed C-130 Hercules|C-130A]] pilot. \n\n\n\n\n=== Hard Landing ===\n[[File:PQK Tough Landing.jpg|thumb|Pham Quang Khiem in front of the C-123K after the crash landing]]\nOn January 24, 1971, Pham Quang Khiem nearly died almost ending his flight career before it started.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://vnafmamn.com/hall-offame/amazing_story.html|title=VNAF \"amazing story\"|website=vnafmamn.com|access-date=2020-04-06}}</ref> After a year of training in the states, Khiem's group was sent to [[Phan Rang Air Base|Phan-Rang AFB]] by the VNAF to start \"In Country Training\" with the [[United States Air Force|USAF]] on a [[C-123K]]. Khiem was assigned to fly with 1LT. Minh and their American Instructor, Cpt. John Mastronardi. Minh was the Aircraft Commander in the left seat and in the right, Khiem switched with Captain Mastronardi to execute co-pilot duties. One day, they had an assignment to transfer 48 of 175-millimeter high explosive bullet heads from [[Bien Hoa Air Base|Bien-Hoa Air Base]] to a US firebase 113 kilometers north near the [[Cambodia|Cambodian]] border. They had to land into an isolated area for a safe distance from any airport facilities since they carried high explosive material. They landed on the short dirt strip, [[B\u00f9 Gia M\u1eadp District|B\u00f9 Gia M\u1eadp]] Air Strip (aka Djamap). The runway was 3000' on top of a 1620' hill. Co-Pilots (in this training) weren't allowed to make any landing on any runway shorter than 3600'. Minh was supposed to handle this flight, but Captain Mastronardi kept Khiem in the right seat believing he could handle the landing after previous successful landings. Khiem was a young pilot and didn't know the difference between a short runway and a long one. It was a hostile area so they had to come in high and drop fast. They came down to 2000' at 78 knots and when the [[C-123K]] was about 20 feet in the air crossing the end of the runway Khiem decided to cut the power to idle causing the aircraft to drop touching down extremely hard. The left main landing gear fell into the belly wrecking the wheel and scratched all the red dirt on the runway skyrocketing it into the cockpit. Khiem and Minh couldn't see anything in front of them. Captain Mastronardi immediately reversed the right engine, bringing the aircraft back stopping the aircraft. If Captain Mastronardi had not stop the aircraft, the whole aircraft may have run off the dirt strip dropping hundreds of yards exploding on the side of the hill.\n\n== End of the War ==\nAt the end of March 1975, the North Vietnamese had already taken half of South Vietnam. Citizens were fleeing as well as soldiers creating chaos throughout the country. Both civilians and officers were hitching military aircraft to escape the North Vietnamese. At the end of March of 1975, the [[North Vietnamese army|NVA]] was pushing towards the coast to strike [[Qui Nh\u01a1n]], [[Tuy H\u00f2a]], and [[Nha Trang]]. \n\n=== Pleiku ===\n[[File:North Vietnamese Gains in the last week of March of '75.jpg|thumb|249x249px|North Vietnamese Gains in the last week of March of '75]]\n<ref>{{Cite book|last=Snepp|first=Frank|title=Decent Interval|publisher=Random House|year=1977|isbn=0-394-40743-1|location=New York, United States|pages=234}}</ref> In the north of South Vietnam, the only remaining government enclave was [[Da Nang]]. <ref>{{Cite book|last=Drendel|first=Lou|title=Air War over Southeast Asia|publisher=squadron/signal|year=1984|isbn=0-89747-148-2|location=1115 Crowley Dr., Carrolton, TX|pages=65}}</ref> Khiem flew three missions into and out of [[Pleiku]], evacuating the families of VNAF personnel. The civil population of Pleiku learned of the evacuation and stormed the [[Pleiku Air Base|airport]]. This forced five C-130's en route from Saigon to turn around before their airlifts were complete. Some C-130's flew bombing missions to destroy the aircraft left behind. They were loaded with 55-gallon drums of [[napalm]], then dropped on VNAF aircraft abandoned on the ramps.\n\n=== Da Nang ===\n28 March 1975, Khiem flew one of the last missions to [[Da Nang Air Base|Da Nang]] at 11:00 pm, the night before its loss. When he landed and taxied to the ramp, an [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam|ARVN]] major jumped into the aircraft to assure himself of a seat. Khiem knew that the thousands of people in the terminal would rush the airplane after seeing this, so Khiem kicked him off. Khiem was a First Lieutenant, and the aircraft commander was searching the terminal for his family. But, the ramp was filled with refugees almost immediately anyway. Around 20,000 pounds of cargo on board, so Khiem yelled at them to offload first. The crowd was too chaotic, so Khiem told the [[loadmaster]] to do unloading and loading through the ramp in the back of the C-130. Once finished, people rushed onto the aircraft. Khiem started the engines, scattering many, allowing Khiem to taxi out.\n\nAs they taxied, the loadmaster yelled at Khiem through the intercom saying he couldn't close the ramp because people were on it. Khiem hit the brakes jamming the refugees in tight allowing the ramp to close. At the end of the runway, an MP (Military Police) in a truck had his family in it, blocking the taxiway and pointing his M-16 at the cockpit.  He motioned to let his family on board. Khiem motioned him to move the truck so he could line up on the runway. Khiem backed up, lined up and took off without the MP. Khiem offloaded at [[Tan Son Nhut Air Base|Tan Son Nhut]] and did a headcount of 350 people. C-130's are maximized to carry 92 passengers but Khiem fit almost four times that amount. \n\n<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://airandspace.si.edu/collection-objects/lockheed-c-130a-45-lm-hercules|title=Lockheed C-130a 45 lm Hercules|last=|first=|date=|website=Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=7 April 2020|quote=\"That flight and the panic that Lt. Khiem saw in Da Nang caused him to consider that if this was likely to happen in Saigon, he would steal a C-130 and get his own family out.\"}}</ref>That mission was the turning point for Khiem. He knew if the chaos reaches Saigon he had to get his family out of Vietnam for good.\n\n=== Nha Trang ===\n31 March 1975, Khiem flew several missions in the evacuation of [[Nha Trang]]. The following day [[Qui Nh\u01a1n]], South Vietnam's third-largest city was captured by the North Vietnamese. The next target for the North Vietnamese was [[Nha Trang Air Base|Nha Trang]]. Khiem just made it just like he did in Da Nang.\n\n== Flight To Freedom ==\n2 April 1975, Khiem caught a ride on a C-130 \"bladder bird\" into [[Phan Rang Air Base|Phan Rang]], in hopes to pinpoint his younger brother, who was an airman there.\u00a0Khiem wanted to take him back to [[Saigon]] to be with the rest of their family.\u00a0Khiem couldn't find hi, so left without him. On the way back to Saigon, Khiem thought if Phan Rang is lost, then\u00a0the communists will come to Saigon. Khiem started to devise a plan to escape South Vietnam with his family. Khiem heard that [[Singapore]] as looking for pilots so that was where he would go. VNAF Pilots started talking about stealing planes with their families so command ordered to fuel the aircraft only with enough to complete their missions. This created a major problem for Khiem. Another was finding someone to help a family escape.\u00a0 \n\n=== Preparation ===\nOne of Khiem's close friends was Major Nguyen Canh in the [[VNAF|South Vietnam Air Force]] and he was in Khiem's sister squadron the 437th Squadron. They discussed the escape and Khiem told him they must be the first otherwise there wouldn't be a second. Major Canh's family was in [[Da Lat]], and he wanted to get them to Saigon before leaving.\u00a0 On 2 April, Da Lat was overrun by the communists and Nguyen lost contact with them.\u00a0After that, he was prepared to escape. On 3 April, all the C-130s were used on bombing missions and Khiem was number one standby for the mission planning board, but Khiem needed to tell his family his plan to escape.\u00a0Khiem went to the Squadron Ops telling the Officer he didn't feel good, and he agreed to drop Khiem to the bottom of the list.\u00a0 This gave Khiem time to run home to tell one of his brothers what he had planned.\u00a0Khiem told his brother to make sure his family close to home because they were all gathered in Saigon.  Khiem told his family to rush to the [[Long Thanh Airport]] as soon as they heard from him. [[Bearcat Base|Long Thanh]] was originally a US Army airbase that Khiem had landed many times in training.\u00a0It was closed and deserted since the US withdrawal in 1973. \n[[File:Pham_Quang_Khiem_in_C-130A.jpg|alt=|thumb|27-year-old Pham Quang Khiem in C-130A: 1974]]\nKhiem's house was in a mile of the airport and ran home and told his family to leave.\u00a0But there was a hindrance, Khiem and Nguyen were in different squadrons, and would not usually fly together\u00a0and could not even get into the squadron area because the guards were unfamiliar with him. But luck was on Khiem's side. The airplane Khiem was supposed to escape with had mechanical problems, and the 437th had to borrow the 435th's C-130a HCF 460, nickname \"''Saigon Lady''\", and would let Khiem in the area. Now Khiem\u00a0had to get rid of Canh's co-pilot. The co-pilot let Khiem fly gladly cause he wanted the rest of the day off to prepare for his date.\n\nNow the biggest problem left of all: the fuel. Khiem thought they would only have enough fuel to maybe make it to Thailand. Khiem quickly checked the fuel to find out the entire tank was full. The man fueling the tank took a smoke break and filled the tank all the way. This full tank of gas meant Singapore was possible. \n\nLt. Khiem, Major Canh, and the rest of the crew (not knowing where they were going) were prepared for takeoff. Khiem took off without clearance and turned southeast instead of east. Khiem told the crew on the intercom that they were redirected to Long Thanh instead of [[Phan Rang Air Base|Phan Rang]]. They landed safely land the loadmaster opened the ramp unloading 20,000 lbs of dry-rice. Khiem's brother in [[Phan Rang Air Base|Phan Rang]] made it to their parent's house in Saigon a few minutes before the escape. While Khiem's family and friends of 53 people boarded, he told the crew that he was escaping Vietnam and they could come if they wanted. The Flight Engineer got up then sat back down and said he would come. The number one loadmaster thought Khiem and Canh were defecting to the North Vietnamese.\u00a0He served in the VNAF for ten years and ran away as fast as he could. The other loadmaster was on his first C-130 training ride and had no clue as to what was going on, so he just stood next to the open ramp.\n\n=== Escape ===\n<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://welovedexter.com/2018/09/02/phillip-phams-father-borrows-military-plane-saves-family/|title=Phillip Pham\u2019s Father \u201cBorrows\u201d Military Plane, Saves Family|last=Communities|first=Disover|date=2 September 2019|website=We Love Dexter|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=7 April 2020}}</ref> Khiem started taxiing away but when everyone boarded the plane with their luggage, Khiem's two-year-old daughter was trampled and knocked out with blood everywhere. Khiem's wife, Ngoc-My, saw her thinking she was dead and passed out dropping their infant child on the ground. The infant child was left on the tarmac as Khiem started to taxi but, luckily, Khiem's oldest brother's wife ran out and grabbed the infant and ran back into the moving C-130A (all of them recovered after). As Khiem started taxiing to the takeoff end of the runway, Khiem saw the loadmaster speaking to many [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam|ARVN]] soldiers who came in a jeep. As Khiem and Canh turned to take off, the Jeep came and pointed an [[M79 grenade launcher|M-79 grenade launcher]] at the cockpit. Khiem\u00a0took off anyways knowing they wouldn't fire.  The ramp was still open, so Khiem ran back and told the puzzled, inexperienced loadmaster to hold the switch until the ramp was up, then Khiem ran to the cockpit\u00a0just in time to raise the gear. The\u00a0period from Khiem landing to Khiem and the passengers leaving was only seven minutes.\n\n==== Shallow Flying ====\nKhiem and Canh flew at tree-top level until they reached the sea then they dropped down to the sea-level. it got very humid in the back resulting in a thick fog forming. Khiem's family and friends could not see each other because the fog was too thick. One hour later, they raised to 16,000 feet and flew straight to Singapore.\u00a0\n\n==== Singapore ====\n[[File:Picture_of_a_C-130A_of_the_VNAF.jpg|alt=|thumb|One of the C-130A's Khiem flew in the VNAF]]\n<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thekopi.co/2020/01/24/refugees-c-130-plane/|title=How Vietnam War Refugees Fled to Singapore Using a Stolen C-130 Plane|last=Ng|first=Vanessa|date=2019|website=The Kopi|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=7 April 2020}}</ref> They arrived in Singapore at around 7:00 PM. Khiem called Approach Control for instructions but could not understand them, so he changed to Tower Frequency, and requested\u00a0landing instruction. Yet, the call was intercepted by the [[Republic of Singapore Air Force|Singapore Air Force]]. Khiem told the other end of the line that the C-130A was off course and running out of fuel. So, they allowed Khiem to land on runway 02. They all stayed put until the authorities came.\n\nThe officials had no clue what to do with them. Singapore Prime Minister [[Lee Kuan Yew]] was out of the country for another two weeks. The Singapore Air Defense Command (SADC) was also renamed the Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF) on 01 April 1975, just two days before Khiem arrived. \n\nKhiem proposed for them to leave Singapore and go to Australia so Singapore wouldn't have to deal with them. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://raiderrelease.com/1343/features/mr-pham-shares-experience-of-escaping-communist-invasion-of-south-viet-nam/|title=Mr. Pham Shares Experience of Escaping Communist Invasion of South Viet Nam|last=Klegg|first=Kassandra|date=March 3, 2015|website=Raider Release|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=8 April 2020}}</ref>They agreed, but only if they would pay for gas. They only accepted U.S. currency and all the passengers had a combined total of around $100-400. Khiem tried to bribe with jewelry but they would not accept. The group was moved in separate prison trucks to a detention center outside Singapore. Khiem and the others were released until the [[Fall of Saigon]]. \n\n==== Saipan ====\nAfter spending three weeks in the jail, they were all flown to [[Saipan]] in a deluxe hotel. After a week there, they finally learned that the [[South Vietnam|Republic of Vietnam]] (South Vietnam) had fallen to the northern communists.\n\n==== The United States of America ====\nKhiem and his family ended up at [[Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton|Camp Pendleton, California]], where they were processed into the U.S. Finally, Khiem, Canh, and the others were free at last.\n\n== Homecoming ==\nKhiem got his entire family out, except his youngest brother in the [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam|ARVN]]. He was stationed at [[V\u0169ng T\u00e0u]]. After the communists took over, he was sent to a brain-washing camp for two years. On 01 August 1992, he was reunited with Khiem and his family through the [[Orderly Departure Program|ODP program]].\n\n== Post-Vietnam Career ==\nWhen Captain Mastronardi found out Khiem was in America, he sent Khiem $500 ($2,200+ today). Khiem and his family then settled in [[Dayton, Ohio]], birthplace of flight, and home to [[Wright-Patterson Air Force Base|Wright-Patterson AFB]]. In the mid 80's, Khiem was hired by [[Piedmont Airlines (1948\u20131989)|Piedmont Airlines]], (later merged with [[US Airways|USAir]] and now [[American Airlines|US Airways]]) and moved to the right seat in only 3 years later. \n\n=== Kind of Hard Landing ===\nOn January 30, 1991, Khiem was flying a [[Boeing 737]], and after leaving [[Raleigh, North Carolina|Raleigh NC]], he headed up to [[Washington National Airport]]. Khiem was ready to land at runway 36 but when he was about 3 miles from it, the plane taking off that runway aborted making Khiem redirect to runway 33 (a shorter runway). Khiem swung over, aligning with runway 33 and prepared land. Runway 33 was even shorter with the [[Potomac River]] on one end and [[The Pentagon]] on the other. Khiem maintained airspeed and tried to touch down on the runway numbers which are only 500 feet from the end of runway instead of 1000 feet and Khiem let the air speed drop 5 knots. The 737 slammed on the runway with the two main wheels and the nose with 87 people on-board. Khiem knew this landing was a bit hard on the passengers and was the only bad landing he made in his airline pilot career.\n\n== ''Saigon Lady'' ==\n[[File:Pham_Family_Reunited_With_Saigon_Lady_after_10_years.jpg|alt=|left|thumb|Khiem Pham and his Family Reunited With Saigon Lady after 10 years.]]\n[[File:\"Saigon_Lady\",_C-130A_at_National_Warplane_Musuem.jpg|link=File:%22Saigon_Lady%22,_C-130A_at_National_Warplane_Musuem.jpg|alt=|thumb|\"Saigon Lady\", C-130A at National Warplane Musuem]]\nOn April 19, 1985, Khiem and his family visited [[Selfridge Air National Guard Base|Selfridge AFB]] to see the plane that brought his family freedom after ten years. \n\n''Saigon Lady'' was transferred to the [[National Air and Space Museum|Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum]] on January 30, 1989, where it has been until it was transferred to the [[National Warplane Museum]] for restoration and preparation for public display.\n<br />\n[[File:\"Saigon_Lady\"_in_Washington.jpg|link=File:%22Saigon_Lady%22_in_Washington.jpg|alt=|center|thumb|C-130A, \"Saigon Lady\" in Washington]]\n\n\n\n\n== References ==\n<!-- Inline citations added to your article will automatically display here.

Khiem was a cargo pilot with the 53rd Tactical Wing of the 5th Air Division stationed at [[Tan Son Nhut Air Base|Tan Son Nhut]]. Khiem flew several missions into communists gained [[Pleiku Air Base|Pleiku]] in hopes to rescue VNAF personnel. On 03 April 1975, Khiem organized a plan to steal a C-130a and gather 53 people to rescue them from the communist [[North Vietnam|North Vietnamese]]. Later, Khiem became a pilot for [[Piedmont Airlines (1948\u20131989)|Piedmont Airlines]] until 2006.\n\n== Early Life ==\n[[File:Pham_Family_1960.jpg|alt=|left|thumb|190x190px|Pham family in 1960.]]\nPham Quang Khiem was born on December 27, 1946, in [[V\u0129nh Long|V\u0129nh-Long, Vietnam]]. Khiem had ten siblings (five boys and five girls) and all of his brothers were in the military. Three of them were in the VNAF and one in the [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam|ARVN]]. Khiem got married on June 8, 1972, to Ngoc-My Tran. Together they had three children: two in South Vietnam and one in the [[United States|United States of America]].\n\n== Early Career ==\n[[File:Pham_Quang_Khiem_at_Lockbourne_AFB.jpg|alt=|left|thumb|195x195px|Pham Quang Khiem at Lockbourne AFB]]\n<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://t28trojanfoundation.com/vnaf.html|title=VNAF|website=Helen Murphy|language=en|access-date=2020-04-06}}</ref>In November 1969, Khiem went to [[Lackland Air Force Base|Lackland AFB]] to learn [[English language|English]] as a VNAF air cadet. At [[Randolph Air Force Base|Randolph AFB]], he earned his basic pilot training, then moved on to [[Keesler Air Force Base|Keesler AFB]], where he flew the [[T-28 Trojan]].\u00a0Khiem also trained at [[Lockbourne AFB]] from October-December of 1970. Eventually, he was designated to fly transport aircraft and was pilot-in-command of [[C-123K]] aircraft before moving up to the 53rd Tactical Wing, 435th Transport Squadron as a [[Lockheed C-130 Hercules|C-130A]] pilot. \n\n\n\n\n=== Hard Landing ===\n[[File:PQK Tough Landing.jpg|thumb|Pham Quang Khiem in front of the C-123K after the crash landing]]\nOn January 24, 1971, Pham Quang Khiem nearly died almost ending his flight career before it started.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://vnafmamn.com/hall-offame/amazing_story.html|title=VNAF \"amazing story\"|website=vnafmamn.com|access-date=2020-04-06}}</ref> After a year of training in the states, Khiem's group was sent to [[Phan Rang Air Base|Phan-Rang AFB]] by the VNAF to start \"In Country Training\" with the [[United States Air Force|USAF]] on a [[C-123K]]. Khiem was assigned to fly with 1LT. Minh and their American Instructor, Cpt. John Mastronardi. Minh was the Aircraft Commander in the left seat and in the right, Khiem switched with Captain Mastronardi to execute co-pilot duties. One day, they had an assignment to transfer 48 of 175-millimeter high explosive bullet heads from [[Bien Hoa Air Base|Bien-Hoa Air Base]] to a US firebase 113 kilometers north near the [[Cambodia|Cambodian]] border. They had to land into an isolated area for a safe distance from any airport facilities since they carried high explosive material. They landed on the short dirt strip, [[B\u00f9 Gia M\u1eadp District|B\u00f9 Gia M\u1eadp]] Air Strip (aka Djamap). The runway was 3000' on top of a 1620' hill. Co-Pilots (in this training) weren't allowed to make any landing on any runway shorter than 3600'. Minh was supposed to handle this flight, but Captain Mastronardi kept Khiem in the right seat believing he could handle the landing after previous successful landings. Khiem was a young pilot and didn't know the difference between a short runway and a long one. It was a hostile area so they had to come in high and drop fast. They came down to 2000' at 78 knots and when the [[C-123K]] was about 20 feet in the air crossing the end of the runway Khiem decided to cut the power to idle causing the aircraft to drop touching down extremely hard. The left main landing gear fell into the belly wrecking the wheel and scratched all the red dirt on the runway skyrocketing it into the cockpit. Khiem and Minh couldn't see anything in front of them. Captain Mastronardi immediately reversed the right engine, bringing the aircraft back stopping the aircraft. If Captain Mastronardi had not stop the aircraft, the whole aircraft may have run off the dirt strip dropping hundreds of yards exploding on the side of the hill.\n\n== End of the War ==\nAt the end of March 1975, the North Vietnamese had already taken half of South Vietnam. Citizens were fleeing as well as soldiers creating chaos throughout the country. Both civilians and officers were hitching military aircraft to escape the North Vietnamese. At the end of March of 1975, the [[North Vietnamese army|NVA]] was pushing towards the coast to strike [[Qui Nh\u01a1n]], [[Tuy H\u00f2a]], and [[Nha Trang]]. \n\n=== Pleiku ===\n[[File:North Vietnamese Gains in the last week of March of '75.jpg|thumb|249x249px|North Vietnamese Gains in the last week of March of '75]]\n<ref>{{Cite book|last=Snepp|first=Frank|title=Decent Interval|publisher=Random House|year=1977|isbn=0-394-40743-1|location=New York, United States|pages=234}}</ref> In the north of South Vietnam, the only remaining government enclave was [[Da Nang]]. <ref>{{Cite book|last=Drendel|first=Lou|title=Air War over Southeast Asia|publisher=squadron/signal|year=1984|isbn=0-89747-148-2|location=1115 Crowley Dr., Carrolton, TX|pages=65}}</ref> Khiem flew three missions into and out of [[Pleiku]], evacuating the families of VNAF personnel. The civil population of Pleiku learned of the evacuation and stormed the [[Pleiku Air Base|airport]]. This forced five C-130's en route from Saigon to turn around before their airlifts were complete. Some C-130's flew bombing missions to destroy the aircraft left behind. They were loaded with 55-gallon drums of [[napalm]], then dropped on VNAF aircraft abandoned on the ramps.\n\n=== Da Nang ===\n28 March 1975, Khiem flew one of the last missions to [[Da Nang Air Base|Da Nang]] at 11:00 PM, the night before it's loss. When he landed and taxied to the ramp, an [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam|ARVN]] major jumped into the aircraft to assure himself of a seat. Khiem knew that the thousands of people in the terminal would rush the airplane after seeing this, so Khiem kicked him off. Khiem was a First Lieutenant, and the aircraft commander was searching the terminal for his family. But, the ramp was filled with refugees almost immediately anyway. Around 20,000 pounds of cargo on board, so Khiem yelled at them to offload first. The crowd was too chaotic, so Khiem told the [[loadmaster]] to do unloading and loading through the ramp in the back of the C-130. Once finished, people rushed onto the aircraft. Khiem started the engines, scattering many, allowing Khiem to taxi out.\n\nAs they taxied, the loadmaster yelled at Khiem through the intercom saying he couldn't close the ramp because people were on it. Khiem hit the brakes jamming the refugees in tight allowing the ramp to close. At the end of the runway, an MP (Military Police) in a truck had his family in it, blocking the taxiway and pointing his M-16 at the cockpit.  He motioned to let his family on board. Khiem motioned him to move the truck so he could line up on the runway. Khiem backed up, lined up and took off without the MP. Khiem offloaded at [[Tan Son Nhut Air Base|Tan Son Nhut]] and did a headcount of 350 people. C-130's are maximized to carry 92 passengers but Khiem fit almost four times that amount. \n\n<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://airandspace.si.edu/collection-objects/lockheed-c-130a-45-lm-hercules|title=Lockheed C-130a 45 lm Hercules|last=|first=|date=|website=Smithsonian National Air and Space Musuem|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=7 April 2020|quote=\"That flight and the panic that Lt. Khiem saw in Da Nang caused him to consider that if this was likely to happen in Saigon, he would steal a C-130 and get his own family out.\"}}</ref>That mission was the turning point for Khiem. He knew if the chaos reaches Saigon he had to get his family out of Vietnam for good.\n\n=== Nha Trang ===\n31 March 1975, Khiem flew several missions in the evacuation of [[Nha Trang]]. The following day [[Qui Nh\u01a1n]], South Vietnam's third-largest city was captured by the North Vietnamese. The next target for the North Vietnamese was [[Nha Trang Air Base|Nha Trang]]. Khiem just made it just like he did in Da Nang.\n\n== Flight To Freedom ==\n2 April 1975, Khiem caught a ride on a C-130 \"bladder bird\" into [[Phan Rang Air Base|Phan Rang]], in hopes to pinpoint his younger brother, who was an airman there.\u00a0Khiem wanted to take him back to [[Saigon]] to be with the rest of their family.\u00a0Khiem couldn't find hi, so left without him. On the way back to Saigon, Khiem thought if Phan Rang is lost, then\u00a0the communists will come to Saigon. Khiem started to devise a plan to escape South Vietnam with his family. Khiem heard that [[Singapore]] as looking for pilots so that was where he would go. VNAF Pilots started talking about stealing planes with their families so command ordered to fuel the aircraft only with enough to complete their missions. This created a major problem for Khiem. Another was finding someone to help a family escape.\u00a0 \n\n=== Preparation ===\nOne of Khiem's close friends was Major Nguyen Canh in the [[VNAF|South Vietnam Air Force]] and he was in Khiem's sister squadron the 437th Squadron. They discussed the escape and Khiem told him they must be the first otherwise there wouldn't be a second. Major Canh's family was in [[Da Lat]], and he wanted to get them to Saigon before leaving.\u00a0 On 2 April, Da Lat was overrun by the communists and Nguyen lost contact with them.\u00a0After that, he was prepared to escape. On 3 April, all the C-130s were used on bombing missions and Khiem was number one standby for the mission planning board, but Khiem needed to tell his family his plan to escape.\u00a0Khiem went to the Squadron Ops telling the Officer he didn't feel good, and he agreed to drop Khiem to the bottom of the list.\u00a0 This gave Khiem time to run home to tell one of his brothers what he had planned.\u00a0Khiem told his brother to make sure his family close to home because they were all gathered in Saigon.  Khiem told his family to rush to the [[Long Thanh Airport]] as soon as they heard from him. [[Bearcat Base|Long Thanh]] was originally a US Army airbase that Khiem had landed many times in training.\u00a0It was closed and deserted since the US withdrawal in 1973. \n[[File:Pham_Quang_Khiem_in_C-130A.jpg|alt=|thumb|27-year-old Pham Quang Khiem in C-130A: 1974]]\nKhiem's house was in a mile of the airport and ran home and told his family to leave.\u00a0But there was a hindrance, Khiem and Nguyen were in different squadrons, and would not usually fly together\u00a0and could not even get into the squadron area because the guards were unfamiliar with him. But luck was on Khiem's side. The airplane Khiem was supposed to escape with had mechanical problems, and the 437th had to borrow the 435th's C-130a HCF 460, nickname \"''Saigon Lady''\", and would let Khiem in the area. Now Khiem\u00a0had to get rid of Canh's co-pilot. The co-pilot let Khiem fly gladly cause he wanted the rest of the day off to prepare for his date.\n\nNow the biggest problem left of all: the fuel. Khiem thought they would only have enough fuel to maybe make it to Thailand. Khiem quickly checked the fuel to find out the entire tank was full. The man fueling the tank took a smoke break and filled the tank all the way. This full tank of gas meant Singapore was possible. \n\nLt. Khiem, Major Canh, and the rest of the crew (not knowing where they were going) were prepared for takeoff. Khiem took off without clearance and turned southeast instead of east. Khiem told the crew on the intercom that they were redirected to Long Thanh instead of [[Phan Rang Air Base|Phan Rang]]. They landed safelyand the loadmaster opened the ramp unloading 20,000 lbs of dry-rice. Khiem's brother in [[Phan Rang Air Base|Phan Rang]] made it to their parent's house in Saigon a few minutes before the escape. While Khiem's family and friends of 53 people boarded, he told the crew that he was escaping Vietnam and they could come if they wanted. The Flight Engineer got up then sat back down and said he would come. The number one loadmaster thought Khiem and Canh were defecting to the North Vietnamese.\u00a0He served in the VNAF for ten years and ran away as fast as he could. The other loadmaster was on his first C-130 training ride and had no clue as to what was going on, so he just stood next to the open ramp.\n\n=== Escape ===\n<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://welovedexter.com/2018/09/02/phillip-phams-father-borrows-military-plane-saves-family/|title=Phillip Pham\u2019s Father \u201cBorrows\u201d Military Plane, Saves Family|last=Communities|first=Disover|date=2 September 2019|website=We Love Dexter|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=7 April 2020}}</ref> Khiem started taxiing away but when everyone boarded the plane with their luggage, Khiem's two-year-old daughter was trampled and knocked out with blood everywhere. Khiem's wife, Ngoc-My, saw her thinking she was dead and passed out dropping their infant child on the ground. The infant child was left on the tarmac as Khiem started to taxi but, luckily, Khiem's oldest brother's wife ran out and grabbed the infant and ran back into the moving C-130A (all of them recovered after). As Khiem started taxiing to the takeoff end of the runway, Khiem saw the loadmaster speaking to many [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam|ARVN]] soldiers who came in a jeep. As Khiem and Canh turned to take off, the Jeep came and pointed an [[M79 grenade launcher|M-79 grenade launcher]] at the cockpit. Khiem\u00a0took off anyways knowing they wouldn't fire.  The ramp was still open, so Khiem ran back and told the puzzled, inexperienced loadmaster to hold the switch until the ramp was up, then Khiem ran to the cockpit\u00a0just in time to raise the gear. The\u00a0period from Khiem landing to Khiem and the passengers leaving was only seven minutes.\n\n==== Shallow Flying ====\nKhiem and Canh flew at tree-top level until they reached the sea then they dropped down to the sea-level. it got very humid in the back resulting in a thick fog forming. Khiem's family and friends could not see each other because the fog was too thick. One hour later, they raised to 16,000 feet and flew straight to Singapore.\u00a0\n\n==== Singapore ====\n[[File:Picture_of_a_C-130A_of_the_VNAF.jpg|alt=|thumb|One of the C-130A's Khiem flew in the VNAF]]\n<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thekopi.co/2020/01/24/refugees-c-130-plane/|title=How Vietnam War Refugees Fled to Singapore Using a Stolen C-130 Plane|last=Ng|first=Vanessa|date=2019|website=The Kopi|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=7 April 2020}}</ref> They arrived in Singapore at around 7:00 PM. Khiem called Approach Control for instructions but could not understand them, so he changed to Tower Frequency, and requested\u00a0landing instruction. Yet, the call was intercepted by the [[Republic of Singapore Air Force|Singapore Air Force]]. Khiem told the other end of the line that the C-130A was off course and running out of fuel. So, they allowed Khiem to land on runway 02. They all stayed put until the authorities came.\n\nThe officials had no clue what to do with them. Singapore Prime Minister [[Lee Kuan Yew]] was out of the country for another two weeks. The Singapore Air Defense Command (SADC) was also renamed the Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF) on 01 April 1975, just two days before Khiem arrived. \n\nKhiem proposed for them to leave Singapore and go to Australia so Singapore wouldn't have to deal with them. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://raiderrelease.com/1343/features/mr-pham-shares-experience-of-escaping-communist-invasion-of-south-viet-nam/|title=Mr. Pham Shares Experience of Escaping Communist Invasion of South Viet Nam|last=Klegg|first=Kassandra|date=March 3, 2015|website=Raider Release|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=8 April 2020}}</ref>They agreed, but only if they would pay for gas. They only accepted U.S. currency and all the passengers had a combined total of around $100-400. Khiem tried to bribe with jewelry but they would not accept. The group was moved in separate prison trucks to a detention center outside Singapore. Khiem and the others were released until the [[Fall of Saigon]]. \n\n==== Saipan ====\nAfter spending three weeks in the jail, they were all flown to [[Saipan]] in a deluxe hotel. After a week there, they finally learned that the [[South Vietnam|Republic of Vietnam]] (South Vietnam) had fallen to the northern communists.\n\n==== The United States of America ====\nKhiem and his family ended up at [[Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton|Camp Pendleton, California]], where they were processed into the U.S. Finally, Khiem, Canh, and the others were free at last.\n\n== Homecoming ==\nKhiem got his entire family out, except his youngest brother in the [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam|ARVN]]. He was stationed at [[V\u0169ng T\u00e0u]]. After the communists took over, he was sent to a brain-washing camp for two years. On 01 August 1992, he was reunited with Khiem and his family through the [[Orderly Departure Program|ODP program]].\n\n== Post-Vietnam Career ==\nWhen Captain Mastronardi found out Khiem was in America, he sent Khiem $500 ($2,200+ today). Khiem and his family then settled in [[Dayton, Ohio]], birthplace of flight, and home to [[Wright-Patterson Air Force Base|Wright-Patterson AFB]]. In the mid 80's, Khiem was hired by [[Piedmont Airlines (1948\u20131989)|Piedmont Airlines]], (later merged with [[US Airways|USAir]] and now [[American Airlines|US Airways]]) and moved to the right seat in only 3 years later. \n\n=== Kind of Hard Landing ===\nOn January 30, 1991, Khiem was flying a [[Boeing 737]], and after leaving [[Raleigh, North Carolina|Raleigh NC]], he headed up to [[Washington National Airport]]. Khiem was ready to land at runway 36 but when he was about 3 miles from it, the plane taking off that runway aborted making Khiem redirect to runway 33 (a shorter runway). Khiem swung over, aligning with runway 33 and prepared land. Runway 33 was even shorter with the [[Potomac River]] on one end and [[The Pentagon]] on the other. Khiem maintained airspeed and tried to touch down on the runway numbers which are only 500 feet from the end of runway instead of 1000 feet and Khiem let the air speed drop 5 knots. The 737 slammed on the runway with the two main wheels and the nose with 87 people on-board. Khiem knew this landing was a bit hard on the passengers and was the only bad landing he made in his airline pilot career.\n\n== ''Saigon Lady'' ==\n[[File:Pham_Family_Reunited_With_Saigon_Lady_after_10_years.jpg|alt=|left|thumb|Khiem Pham and his Family Reunited With Saigon Lady after 10 years.]]\n[[File:\"Saigon_Lady\",_C-130A_at_National_Warplane_Musuem.jpg|link=File:%22Saigon_Lady%22,_C-130A_at_National_Warplane_Musuem.jpg|alt=|thumb|\"Saigon Lady\", C-130A at National Warplane Musuem]]\nOn April 19, 1985, Khiem and his family visited [[Selfridge Air National Guard Base|Selfridge AFB]] to see the plane that brought his family freedom after ten years. \n\n''Saigon Lady'' was transferred to the [[National Air and Space Museum|Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum]] on January 30, 1989, where it has been until it was transferred to the [[National Warplane Museum]] for restoration and preparation for public display.\n<br />\n[[File:\"Saigon_Lady\"_in_Washington.jpg|link=File:%22Saigon_Lady%22_in_Washington.jpg|alt=|center|thumb|C-130A, \"Saigon Lady\" in Washington]]\n\n\n\n\n== References ==\n<!-- Inline citations added to your article will automatically display here.

It was nominated for six [[Academy Awards]], including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], but lost to ''Gone with the Wind'', also directed by Fleming.

The songs were written by [[Yip Harburg|Edgar \"Yip\" Harburg]] (lyrics) and [[Harold Arlen]] (music). The musical score and the incidental music were composed by Stothart.\n\n==Plot==\n[[File:The Wizard of Oz Judy Garland Terry 1939.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Judy Garland as Dorothy Gale and Terry the Dog as Toto]]\n<!--Per WP:FILMPLOT, plots are between 400 and 700 words.-->\n[[Dorothy Gale]] lives with her dog [[Toto (Oz)|Toto]] on a [[Kansas]] farm belonging to her [[Aunt Em]] and [[Uncle Henry (Oz)|Uncle Henry]].  One day, Toto bites neighbor Miss Almira Gulch on the leg, leading her to obtain an order from the sheriff to [[Animal euthanasia|euthanize]] him.  In spite of Dorothy's pleas and Aunt Em's resistance, Miss Gulch takes Toto away in a basket, but Toto escapes and returns to Dorothy; she decides to run away in order to ensure that Toto won't be euthanized.  Not far from the farm, she meets [[Professor Marvel]], a kind fortune teller who uses his crystal ball to make Dorothy believe that Aunt Em may be dying of a broken heart.  Horrified, Dorothy rushes home as a storm approaches; a [[tornado]] forms, and Aunt Em, Uncle Henry, and the farmhands take shelter in the [[storm cellar]] as Dorothy arrives home. Unable to be heard begging for entry, Dorothy seeks shelter in her bedroom. The window is blown in from its frame and hits Dorothy on the head, knocking her unconscious.  The house is sent spinning into the air, and she awakens to see various figures fly by, including Miss Gulch on her bicycle, who transforms into a witch on a broomstick.\n\nThe house lands in [[Munchkin Country|Munchkinland]] in the [[Land of Oz]]. [[Glinda the Good Witch|Glinda the Good Witch of the North]] and the [[Munchkin]]s welcome her as a heroine, as the falling house has killed the [[Wicked Witch of the East]].  Her sister, the [[Wicked Witch of the West]], arrives to claim her [[ruby slippers]], but Glinda transfers them onto Dorothy's feet first.  Enraged, the Wicked Witch of the West swears revenge on Dorothy and vanishes.  Glinda tells Dorothy to keep the slippers on and follow the [[yellow brick road]] to the [[Emerald City]], where she can ask the [[Wizard of Oz (character)|Wizard of Oz]] to help her return home.  On her journey, Dorothy meets the [[Scarecrow (Oz)|Scarecrow]], who wants a brain, the [[Tin Woodman]], who desires a heart, and the [[Cowardly Lion]], who needs courage.  Dorothy invites them to accompany her to Emerald City, where they can also ask the Wizard for help.  Despite the Witch's attempts to stop them, they reach the Emerald City and are eventually allowed to see the Wizard, who appears as a ghostly head surrounded by fire and smoke.  He agrees to grant their wishes if they prove their worth by bringing him the Witch's broomstick.\n\nAs the foursome and Toto make their way to the Witch's castle, the Witch captures Dorothy and plots to kill her and retrieve the slippers. Toto escapes and leads her three friends to the castle. They ambush three guards, don their uniforms and free Dorothy. The Witch and her guards chase and surround them.  The Witch sets fire to the Scarecrow, causing Dorothy to toss a bucket of water, inadvertently splashing the Witch, who melts away; the guards rejoice and give Dorothy her broomstick.\n\nUpon their return to the Emerald City, the Wizard stalls in fulfilling his promises until Toto pulls back a curtain and exposes the \"Wizard\" as a middle-aged man operating machinery and speaking into a microphone. Admitting to being a [[humbug]], he insists that he is \"a good man but a bad wizard.\" The Wizard then gives the Scarecrow a diploma, the Lion a medal and the Tin Man a ticking heart-shaped watch, helping them see that the attributes they sought were already within them. He then offers to take Dorothy and Toto home in his [[hot air balloon]], revealing that he is also from Kansas and was originally a carnival worker before a tornado brought him to the Emerald City, whereupon he accepted the job as Wizard due to [[Great Depression|hard times]].\n\nAs Dorothy and the Wizard prepare to depart, Toto becomes distracted by a cat and leaps from Dorothy's arms. As Dorothy pursues Toto, the balloon disembarks with the Wizard, leaving her behind. Glinda appears and tells Dorothy that the ruby slippers have the power to return her to Kansas. After sharing a tearful farewell with Scarecrow, Tin Man, and Lion, Dorothy follows Glinda's instructions: she must close her eyes, tap her heels together three times, and state repeatedly, \"There's no place like home.\" Dorothy complies and she wakes up in her bedroom surrounded by her family and friends, including Toto.  Everyone dismisses her adventure as a dream, but Dorothy insists it was real and says she will never run away from home again before declaring, \"There's no place like home!\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{For|a list of all the munchkin actors/actresses in the film|Munchkin#Actors and actresses}} <!--There were a-lot of roles with the munchkin characters-->\n\n[[File:The Wizard of Oz Lahr Garland Bolger Haley 1939.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8| The [[Cowardly Lion]], [[Dorothy Gale|Dorothy]], [[Scarecrow (Oz)|The Scarecrow]], and [[Tin Woodman|The Tin Man]] are the film's main characters.]]\nCast listing:\n* [[Judy Garland]] as [[Dorothy Gale]]\n* [[Frank Morgan]] as (in order of appearance) Professor Marvel/The Gatekeeper/The Carriage Driver/The Guard/[[Wizard of Oz (character)|The Wizard of Oz]]\n* [[Ray Bolger]] as \"Hunk\" / [[Scarecrow (Oz)|The Scarecrow]]\n* [[Jack Haley]] as \"Hickory\" / [[Tin Woodman|The Tin Man]]\n* [[Bert Lahr]] as \"Zeke\" / The [[Cowardly Lion]]\n* [[Billie Burke]] as [[Glinda the Good Witch|Glinda]]\n* [[Margaret Hamilton (actress)|Margaret Hamilton]] as Miss Almira Gulch / [[Wicked Witch of the West|The Wicked Witch of the West]]\n* [[Charley Grapewin]] as [[Uncle Henry (Oz)|Uncle Henry]]\n* [[Pat Walshe]] as Nikko the [[Winged monkeys|Winged Monkey]] King\n* [[Clara Blandick]] as [[Auntie Em]]\n* [[Terry (dog)|Terry]] as [[Toto (Oz)|Toto]]\n* [[Mitchell Lewis]] as the Winkie Guard Captain (credited only in the [[IMAX]] version)\n* [[Adriana Caselotti]] as the voice of [[Juliet]] in the Tin Man's song \"[[If I Only Had a Heart]]\" (uncredited)<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/obituary-adriana-caselotti-1277975.html |title=Obituary: Adriana Caselotti |last=Sibley |first=Brian |date=February 10, 1997 |newspaper=The Independent |location=London |access-date=October 8, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nProduction on the film began when [[Walt Disney]]'s ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'' (1937) showed that films adapted from popular children's stories and fairytale folklore could still be successful.<ref name=\"Fricke2\">{{Cite book |title=The Wizard of Oz: The Official 50th Anniversary Pictorial History |last=Fricke |first=John |authorlink=John Fricke |last2=Scarfone |first2=Jay |last3=Stillman |first3=William |year=1986 |publisher=Warner Books, Inc. |location=New York, NY |isbn=978-0-446-51446-0 |page=[https://archive.org/details/wizardofozoffici0000fric/page/18 18] |url=https://archive.org/details/wizardofozoffici0000fric/page/18 }}</ref><ref name=\"TheMakingOfAMovieClassic\" /> In January 1938, [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] bought the rights to L. Frank Baum\u2019s [[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz|hugely popular novel]] from [[Samuel Goldwyn]], who had toyed with the idea of making the film as a vehicle for [[Eddie Cantor]] who was under contract to the Goldwyn studios and whom Goldwyn wanted to cast as the Scarecrow.<ref name=\"TheMakingOfAMovieClassic\" />\n\nThe script went through several writers and revisions before the final shooting.<ref name=\"Harmetz\" /> [[Mervyn LeRoy]]'s assistant, [[William Cannon (director)|William H. Cannon]], had submitted a brief four-page outline.<ref name=\"Harmetz\" /> Because recent fantasy films had not fared well, he recommended toning down or removing the magical elements of the story. In his outline, the Scarecrow was a man so stupid that the only employment open to him was literally scaring crows from cornfields, while the Tin Woodman was a criminal so heartless he was sentenced to be placed in a tin suit for eternity, torture that softened him into somebody gentler and kinder.<ref name=\"Harmetz\" /> His vision was similar to [[Larry Semon]]'s [[The Wizard of Oz (1925 film)|1925 film adaptation]] of the story in which the magical elements are absent.\n\nAfterward, LeRoy hired screenwriter [[Herman J. Mankiewicz]], who soon delivered a 17-page draft of the Kansas scenes and a few weeks later, a further 56 pages. He also hired [[Noel Langley]] and poet [[Ogden Nash]] to write separate versions of the story. None of these three knew about the others, and this was not an uncommon procedure. Nash delivered a four-page outline, Langley turned in a 43-page treatment and a full film script. He{{who|date=August 2017}} turned in three more, this time incorporating the songs that had been written by [[Harold Arlen]] and [[Yip Harburg]]. [[Florence Ryerson]] and [[Edgar Allan Woolf]] submitted a script and were brought on board to touch up the writing. They would be responsible for making sure the story stayed true to the Baum book. However, producer [[Arthur Freed]] was unhappy with their work and reassigned it to Langley.<ref name=Coan>{{cite news|last=Coan|first=Stephen|title=KZN's very own screen wizard|url=http://www.witness.co.za/index.php?showcontent&global%5B_id%5D=73897|accessdate=April 24, 2014|newspaper=The Witness|date=December 22, 2011}}</ref> During filming, [[Victor Fleming]] and [[John Lee Mahin]] revised the script further, adding and cutting some scenes.

And he \u2013 there was eleven screenwriters on that \u2013 and he pulled the whole thing together, wrote his own lines and gave the thing a coherence and unity which made it a work of art.

Because of a perceived need to attract a youthful audience through appealing to modern fads and styles, the score had featured a song called \"The Jitterbug\", and the script had featured a scene with a series of musical contests. A spoiled, selfish princess in Oz had outlawed all forms of music except classical and [[operetta]] and went up against Dorothy in a singing contest in which her swing style enchanted listeners and won the grand prize. This part was initially written for [[Betty Jaynes (actress)|Betty Jaynes]].<ref>{{Cite book| last = Fordin | first = Hugh | title = World of Entertainment | publisher = Avon Books  | location =  | year = 1976 | isbn = 978-0-380-00754-7 }}</ref> The plan was later dropped.\n\nAnother scene, which was removed before final script approval and never filmed, was an epilogue scene back in Kansas after Dorothy's return. Hunk (the Kansan counterpart to the Scarecrow) is leaving for an agricultural college and extracts a promise from Dorothy to write to him. The scene implies that romance will eventually develop between the two, which also may have been intended as an explanation for Dorothy's partiality for the Scarecrow over her other two companions. This plot idea was never totally dropped, but is especially noticeable in the final script when Dorothy, just before she is to leave Oz, tells the Scarecrow, \"I think I'll miss you most of all.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1001433010|title=Hollywood Reporter|date= October 20, 2005 }} {{Dead link|date=February 2012|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}</ref>\n\nMuch attention was given to the use of color in the production, with the MGM production crew favoring some hues over others. It took the studio's art department almost a week to settle on the shade of yellow used for the yellow brick road.<ref>{{cite book |last=Clarke |first=Gerald |year=2001 |title=Get Happy: The Life of Judy Garland |publisher=Delta |isbn=978-0-385-33515-7 |page=94}}</ref>\n\n===Casting===\n{{See also|Munchkin#In the 1939 film}}\n\nSeveral actresses were reportedly considered for the part of Dorothy, including [[Shirley Temple]], at the time, the most prominent child star; [[Deanna Durbin]], a relative newcomer, with a recognised operatic voice; and [[Judy Garland]], the most experienced of the three. Officially, the decision to cast Garland was attributed to contractual issues.\n\n[[File:Buddy Ebsen Tin Man.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Ebsen's costume test as the Tin Man]]\n[[Ray Bolger]] was originally cast as the Tin Man and [[Buddy Ebsen]] was to play the Scarecrow.<ref name=\"timeline\" /> Bolger, however, longed to play the Scarecrow, as his childhood idol [[Fred Stone]] had done [[The Wizard of Oz (1902 musical)|on stage in 1902]]; with that very performance, Stone had inspired him to become a vaudevillian in the first place. Now unhappy with his role as the Tin Man (reportedly claiming, \"I'm not a tin performer; I'm fluid\"), Bolger convinced producer Mervyn LeRoy to recast him in the part he so desired.<ref name=\"cemeteryguide.com\">[http://www.cemeteryguide.com/bolger.html Cemetery Guide, ''Hollywood Remains to Be Seen'', Mark Masek].</ref> Ebsen did not object; after going over the basics of the Scarecrow's distinctive gait with Bolger (as a professional dancer, Ebsen had been cast because the studio was confident he would be up to the task of replicating the famous \"wobbly-walk\" of Stone's Scarecrow), he recorded all of his songs, went through all the rehearsals as the Tin Man and began filming with the rest of the cast.<ref>Fricke, John and Scarfone and William Stillman. ''The Wizard of Oz: The Official 50th Anniversary Pictorial History'', Warner Books, 1989</ref>\n\n[[Bert Lahr]] was signed for the Cowardly Lion on July 25, 1938; the next month, [[Charles Grapewin]] was cast as Uncle Henry on August 12.\n\n[[W. C. Fields]] was originally chosen for the title role of the Wizard, a role turned down by [[Ed Wynn]] as he thought the part was too small, but the studio ran out of patience after protracted haggling over Fields' fee. [[Wallace Beery]] lobbied for the role, but the studio refused to spare him during the long shooting schedule. Instead, another contract player, [[Frank Morgan]], was cast on September 22.\n\nAn extensive talent search produced over a hundred [[Dwarfism|little people]] to play Munchkins; this meant that most of the film's Oz sequences would have to already be shot before work on the Munchkinland sequence could begin. According to Munchkin actor [[Jerry Maren]], the little people were each paid over $125 a week (equivalent to ${{Inflation|index=US|value=125|start_year=1938|r=-2|fmt=c}} today). [[Meinhardt Raabe]], who played the coroner, revealed in the 1990 documentary ''The Making of the Wizard of Oz'' that the MGM costume and wardrobe department, under the direction of designer [[Adrian (costume designer)|Adrian]], had to design over 100 costumes for the Munchkin sequences. They then had to photograph and catalog each Munchkin in his or her costume so that they could correctly apply the same costume and makeup each day of production.\n\n[[Gale Sondergaard]] was originally cast as the Wicked Witch. She became unhappy when the witch's persona shifted from sly and glamorous (thought to emulate the wicked queen in Disney's ''Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs'') into the familiar \"ugly hag\". She turned down the role and was replaced on October 10, 1938, just three days before filming started, by MGM contract player [[Margaret Hamilton (actress)|Margaret Hamilton]]. Sondergaard said in an interview for a bonus feature on the [[DVD]] that she had no regrets about turning down the part, and would go on to play a glamorous villainess in Fox's version of [[Maurice Maeterlinck]]'s ''[[The Blue Bird (1940 film)|The Blue Bird]]'' in 1940; Margaret Hamilton played a role remarkably similar to the Wicked Witch in the Judy Garland film ''[[Babes in Arms (film)|Babes in Arms]]'' (1939).\n\nAccording to Aljean Harmetz, the \"gone-to-seed\" coat worn by Morgan as the wizard was selected from a rack of coats purchased from a second-hand shop. According to legend, Morgan later discovered a label in the coat indicating it had once belonged to Baum, that Baum's widow confirmed this, and that the coat was eventually presented to her. But Baum biographer [[Michael Patrick Hearn]] says the Baum family denies ever seeing the coat or knowing of the story; Hamilton considered it a concocted studio rumor.<ref>[[Michael Patrick Hearn|Hearn, Michael Patrick]].

Thorpe initially shot about two weeks of footage, nine days in total, involving Dorothy's first encounter with the Scarecrow, as well as a number of sequences in the Wicked Witch's castle, such as Dorothy's rescue, which, though unreleased, comprises the only footage of [[Buddy Ebsen]]'s Tin Man.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Practical PHP and MySQL web site databases : a simplified approach|last=West, Adrian W.|isbn=978-1430260776|location=New York|oclc=859580733|year=2014}}</ref>\n\n==== Ebsen replaced by Haley ====\nThe production faced the challenge of simulating the Tin Man's costume.

As director, Fleming chose not to shift the film from Cukor's creative realignment, as producer LeRoy had already pronounced his satisfaction with the new course the film was taking.\n\nProduction on the bulk of the Technicolor sequences was a long and exhausting process that ran for over six months, from October 1938 to March 1939.

The music was composed by [[Harold Arlen]], and the lyrics were written by [[Yip Harburg]], both of whom won the [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]] for \"Over the Rainbow\". The song was ranked first in two lists: the [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Songs]] and the [[Recording Industry Association of America]]'s \"[[Songs of the Century|365 Songs of the Century]]\".\n\nMGM composer [[Herbert Stothart]], a well-known Hollywood composer and songwriter, won the [[Academy Award for Best Original Score]] in recognition of his original score.\n\n[[Georgie Stoll]] was associate conductor and screen credit was given to [[George Bassman]], [[Murray Cutter]], [[Ken Darby]] and Paul Marquardt for orchestral and vocal arrangements (as usual, Roger Edens was also heavily involved as an unbilled musical associate to Freed.)\n\nThe songs were recorded in the studio's scoring stage before filming. Several of the recordings were completed while Ebsen was still with the cast. Therefore, while he had to be dropped from the cast due to illness from the aluminum powder makeup, his singing voice remained in the soundtrack (as noted in the notes for the CD Deluxe Edition). In the group vocals of \"We're Off to See the Wizard\", his voice can be heard. Haley spoke with a distinct [[Boston accent]], thus did not pronounce the ''r'' in ''wizard''. By contrast, Ebsen was a [[Midwestern United States|Midwesterner]], like Garland, and pronounced it. Haley rerecorded Ebsen's solo parts later.\n\nBolger's original recording of \"[[If I Only Had a Brain]]\" had been far more sedate compared to the version heard in the film; during the filming, Cukor and LeRoy decided that a more energetic rendition would better suit Dorothy's initial meeting with the Scarecrow and the song was rerecorded as such. At first thought to be lost, a copy of the original version was discovered in 2009.<ref>[http://www.thejudyroom.com/news-oz.html#brain The Wizard of Oz 70th Anniversary News<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110513210807/http://www.thejudyroom.com/news-oz.html#brain |date=May 13, 2011 }}</ref>\n\n====Song list====\n* \"[[Over the Rainbow]]\" \u2013 Judy Garland as Dorothy Gale\n* Munchkinland Sequence:\n** \"Come Out&nbsp;{{nbsp}}...\" \u2013 Billie Burke as Glinda, and the Munchkins\n** \"It Really Was No Miracle\" \u2013 Judy Garland as Dorothy, Billy Bletcher and the Munchkins\n** \"We Thank You Very Sweetly\" \u2013 Frank Cucksey and Joseph Koziel\n** \"[[Ding-Dong!

Hail! The Witch is Dead!\", sung upon the return to the Emerald City]]\nSome musical pieces filmed were deleted in the editing process.\n\nThe song \"The Jitterbug\", written in a swing style, was intended for the sequence in which the group is journeying to the Witch's castle. Due to time constraints, the song was cut from the final theatrical version. The film footage for the song has been lost, although silent home film footage of rehearsals for the number has survived. The sound recording for the song, however, is intact and was included in the two-CD [[Rhino Entertainment|Rhino Records]] deluxe edition of the film soundtrack, as well as on the VHS and DVD editions of the film. A reference to \"The Jitterbug\" remains in the film: the Witch remarks to her flying monkeys that they should have no trouble apprehending Dorothy and her friends because \"I've sent a little insect on ahead to take the fight out of them.\"\n\nAnother musical number cut before release occurred right after the Wicked Witch of the West was melted and before Dorothy and her friends returned to the Wizard. This was a reprise of \"Ding-Dong! The Witch Is Dead\" (blended with \"[[We're Off to See the Wizard]]\" and \"The Merry Old Land of Oz\") with the lyrics altered to \"Hail! Hail! The Witch is Dead!\" This started with the Witch's guard saying \"Hail to Dorothy! The Wicked Witch is dead!\" and dissolved to a huge celebration of the citizens of the Emerald City singing the song as they accompany Dorothy and her friends to see the Wizard. Today, the film of this scene is also lost and only a few stills survive, along with a few seconds of footage used on several reissue trailers. The entire audio still exists and is included on the two-CD Rhino Record deluxe edition of the film soundtrack.<ref>''The Wizard of Oz: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack \u2013 The Deluxe Edition'', 2-CD set, original recording remastered, [[Rhino Entertainment|Rhino Records]] # 71964 (July 18, 1995)</ref>\n\nIn addition, a brief reprise of \"Over the Rainbow\" was intended to be sung by Garland while Dorothy is trapped in the Witch's castle, but it was cut because it was considered too emotionally intense. The original soundtrack recording still exists, however, and was included as an extra in all home media releases from 1993 onwards.<ref>Warner Bros. 2005 ''The Wizard of Oz'' Deluxe DVD edition, program notes and audio extras.</ref>\n\n====Underscoring====\nExtensive edits in the film's final cut removed vocals from the last portion of the film. However, the film was fully [[Underscoring|underscored]], with instrumental snippets from the film's various [[leitmotif]]s throughout. There was also some recognizable popular music, including:\n* Excerpts from [[Robert Schumann|Schumann]]'s \"The Happy Farmer\", at several points early in the film, including the opening scene when Dorothy and Toto are hurrying home after their encounter with Miss Gulch, when Toto escapes from her, and when the house is \"riding\" the tornado.\n* An excerpt of [[Felix Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn]]'s \"Opus 16, #2\", when Toto escapes from the Witch's castle.\n* An excerpt of [[Modest Mussorgsky|Mussorgsky]]'s \"[[Night on Bald Mountain]]\", when Dorothy, the Scarecrow, the Tin Man, and the Cowardly Lion are trying to escape from the Witch's castle.\n* \"[[In the Shade of the Old Apple Tree]]\", when Dorothy and the Scarecrow discover the anthropomorphic apple trees.\n* \"[[Gaudeamus Igitur]]\" during the Wizard's presentation of awards to the group.\n* \"[[Home! Sweet Home!]]\", in part of the underscore of the closing scene, at Dorothy's house in Kansas.\n\n(The above list is excerpted from the liner notes on the Rhino Records collection.)\n\n===Post-production===\n[[Principal photography]] concluded with the Kansas sequences on March 16, 1939; nonetheless, reshoots and pick-up shots were filmed throughout April and May and into June, under the direction of producer LeRoy. After the deletion of the \"Over the Rainbow\" reprise during subsequent test screenings in early June, Garland had to be brought back one more time to reshoot the \"Auntie Em, I'm frightened!\" scene without the song; the footage of Blandick's Aunt Em, as shot by Vidor, had already been set aside for rear-projection work, and was simply reused.\n\nAfter Hamilton's torturous experience with the Munchkinland elevator, she refused to do the pick-ups for the scene in which she flies on a broomstick that billows smoke, so LeRoy chose to have stand-in Betty Danko perform the scene, instead; as a result, Danko was severely injured doing the scene due to a malfunction in the smoke mechanism.<ref>''The Making of the Wizard of Oz \u2013 Movie Magic and Studio Power in the Prime of MGM \u2013 and the Miracle of Production #1060'', 10th Edition, Bantam Doubleday Dell Publishing Group, Inc./Random House, 1989.</ref>\n\nAt this point, the film began a long arduous post-production. [[Herbert Stothart]] had to compose the film's background score, while [[A. Arnold Gillespie]] had to perfect the various special effects that the film required, including many of the rear projection shots. The MGM art department also had to create the various matte paintings for the background of many of the scenes.\n\nOne significant innovation planned for the film was the use of stencil printing for the transition to Technicolor. Each frame was to be hand-tinted to maintain the sepia tone; however, because this was too expensive and labor-intensive, it was abandoned and MGM used a simpler and less expensive variation of the process. During the reshoots in May, the inside of the farm house was painted sepia, and when Dorothy opens the door, it is not Garland, but her stand-in, Bobbie Koshay, wearing a sepia gingham dress, who then backs out of frame; once the camera moves through the door, Garland steps back into frame in her bright blue gingham dress (as noted in DVD extras), and the sepia-painted door briefly tints her with the same color before she emerges from the house's shadow, into the bright glare of the Technicolor lighting. This also meant that the reshoots provided the first proper shot of Munchkinland; if one looks carefully, the brief cut to Dorothy looking around outside the house bisects a single long shot, from the inside of the doorway to the pan-around that finally ends in a reverse-angle as the ruins of the house are seen behind Dorothy as she comes to a stop at the foot of the small bridge.\n\n[[Test screening]]s of the film began on June 5, 1939.<ref name=\"geo\">{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/Hollywood/Hills/6396/timeline.htm|title=\"The Wizard of Oz\"...&nbsp;A Movie Timeline|author=Jim's \"Wizard of Oz\" Website Directory|publisher=geocities.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071114114015/http://www.geocities.com/Hollywood/Hills/6396/timeline.htm|archivedate=November 14, 2007|accessdate=September 10, 2007}}</ref> ''Oz'' initially ran nearly two hours long. LeRoy and Fleming knew that at least 15 minutes needed to be deleted to get the film down to a manageable running time; the average film in 1939 ran for just about 90 minutes. Three sneak previews in [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]], [[Pomona, California|Pomona]] and [[San Luis Obispo, California]], helped guide LeRoy and Fleming in the cutting. Among the many cuts were \"The Jitterbug\" number, the Scarecrow's elaborate dance sequence following \"If I Only Had a Brain\", reprises of \"Over the Rainbow\" and \"[[Ding-Dong! The Witch Is Dead]]\", and a number of smaller dialogue sequences. This left the final, mostly serious portion of the film with no songs, only the dramatic underscoring.\n\nOne song that was almost deleted was \"Over the Rainbow\". MGM had felt that it made the Kansas sequence too long, as well as being far over the heads of the target audience of children. The studio also thought that it was degrading for Garland to sing in a barnyard. LeRoy, uncredited associate producer Arthur Freed and director Fleming fought to keep it in, and they eventually won. The song went on to win the [[Academy Award]] for Best Song of the Year, and came to be identified so strongly with Garland herself that she made it her theme song.\n\nAfter the preview in San Luis Obispo in early July, the film was officially released in August 1939 at its current 101-minute running time.\n\n==Release==\n[[File:Wizard of Oz (Oconomowoc) cropped.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|A memorial commemorating the film's world premiere at the Strand Theatre in [[Oconomowoc, Wisconsin]] on August 12, 1939]]\n\nThe film premiered at the Orpheum Theatre in [[Green Bay, Wisconsin]] on August 10, 1939.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/moviedetails/7892|title=AFI{{!}}Catalog|website=catalog.afi.com|access-date=2019-09-03}}</ref> The film's first sneak preview was held in [[San Bernardino, California]].<ref>Down The Yellow Brick Road: The Making of The Wizard Of Oz\"McClelland, 1976 Publisher Pyramid Publications (Harcourt Brace Jonavich)</ref>\nThe film was previewed in three [[test market]]s: on August 11, 1939, at [[Kenosha, Wisconsin]] and [[Dennis, Massachusetts]],<ref>{{cite web| title= Hello, yellow brick road | url= http://www.jsonline.com/news/waukesha/51361182.html | date= July 21, 2009 | first= Scott|last= Williams | publisher= [[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]] | accessdate=October 21, 2011| quote=John Fricke, a historian who has written books about ''The Wizard of Oz'', said that MGM executives arranged advance screenings in a handful of small communities to find out how audiences would respond to the musical adventure, which cost nearly $3 million to produce.

While these were considerable earnings, the high production cost, in association with various distribution and other costs, meant the movie initially recorded a loss of $1,145,000 for the studio.<ref name=\"Mannix\"/> It did not show what MGM considered a profit until a 1949 re-release earned an additional $1.5 million (about ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|1.5|1949|r=0}}}} million today). However, for all the risks and cost that MGM undertook to produce the film, it was considered at least more successful than anyone thought it would be. According to Christopher Finch, author of the Judy Garland biography ''Rainbow: The Stormy Life of Judy Garland'', \"Fantasy is always a risk at the box office. The film had been enormously successful as a book, and it had also been a major stage hit, but previous attempts to bring it to the screen had been dismal failures.\" Finch also writes that after the success of the film, Garland signed a new contract with MGM giving her a substantial increase in salary, making her one of the top-ten box office stars in the United States.<ref>{{cite book |last=Finch |first=Christofer |title=Rainbow: The Stormy Life Of Judy Garland |year=1975 |publisher=Ballantine Books |isbn=978-0-345-28407-5 |page=84}}</ref>\n\n===Awards and honors===\n\n====Academy Awards====\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"95%\"\n|- style=\"background:#ccc; text-align:center;\"\n! colspan=\"5\" style=\"background: LightSteelBlue;\" | Awards\n|- style=\"background:#ccc; text-align:center;\"\n!

It was nominated for six [[Academy Awards]], including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], but lost to ''Gone with the Wind'', also directed by Fleming.

One day, Toto bites neighbor Miss Almira Gulch on the leg, leading her to obtain an order from the sheriff to [[Animal euthanasia|euthanize]] him.  In spite of Dorothy's pleas and Aunt Em's resistance, Miss Gulch takes Toto away in a basket, but Toto escapes and returns to Dorothy; she decides to run away in order to ensure that Toto won't be euthanized.  Not far from the farm, she meets [[Professor Marvel]], a kind fortune teller who uses his crystal ball to make Dorothy believe that Aunt Em may be dying of a broken heart.  Horrified, Dorothy rushes home as a storm approaches; a [[tornado]] forms, and Aunt Em, Uncle Henry, and the farmhands take shelter in the [[storm cellar]] as Dorothy arrives home. Unable to be heard begging for entry, Dorothy seeks shelter in her bedroom. The window is blown in from its frame and hits Dorothy on the head, knocking her unconscious.  The house is sent spinning into the air, and she awakens to see various figures fly by, including Miss Gulch on her bicycle, who transforms into a witch on a broomstick.\n\nThe house lands in [[Munchkin Country|Munchkinland]] in the [[Land of Oz]]. [[Glinda the Good Witch|Glinda the Good Witch of the North]] and the [[Munchkin]]s welcome her as a heroine, as the falling house has killed the [[Wicked Witch of the East]].  Her sister, the [[Wicked Witch of the West]], arrives to claim her [[ruby slippers]], but Glinda transfers them onto Dorothy's feet first.  Enraged, the Wicked Witch of the West swears revenge on Dorothy and vanishes.  Glinda tells Dorothy to keep the slippers on and follow the [[yellow brick road]] to the [[Emerald City]], where she can ask the [[Wizard of Oz (character)|Wizard of Oz]] to help her return home.  On her journey, Dorothy meets the [[Scarecrow (Oz)|Scarecrow]], who wants a brain, the [[Tin Woodman]], who desires a heart, and the [[Cowardly Lion]], who needs courage.  Dorothy invites them to accompany her to Emerald City, where they can also ask the Wizard for help.  Despite the Witch's attempts to stop them, they reach the Emerald City and are eventually allowed to see the Wizard, who appears as a ghostly head surrounded by fire and smoke.  He agrees to grant their wishes if they prove their worth by bringing him the Witch's broomstick.\n\nAs the foursome and Toto make their way to the Witch's castle, the Witch captures Dorothy and plots to kill her and retrieve the slippers. Toto escapes and leads her three friends to the castle. They ambush three guards, don their uniforms and free Dorothy. The Witch and her guards chase and surround them.  The Witch sets fire to the Scarecrow, causing Dorothy to toss a bucket of water, inadvertently splashing the Witch, who melts away; the guards rejoice and give Dorothy her broomstick.\n\nUpon their return to the Emerald City, the Wizard stalls in fulfilling his promises until Toto pulls back a curtain and exposes the \"Wizard\" as a middle-aged man operating machinery and speaking into a microphone. Admitting to being a [[humbug]], he insists that he is \"a good man but a bad wizard.\" The Wizard then gives the Scarecrow a diploma, the Lion a medal and the Tin Man a ticking heart-shaped watch, helping them see that the attributes they sought were already within them. He then offers to take Dorothy and Toto home in his [[hot air balloon]], revealing that he is also from Kansas and was originally a carnival worker before a tornado brought him to the Emerald City, whereupon he accepted the job as Wizard due to [[Great Depression|hard times]].\n\nAs Dorothy and the Wizard prepare to depart, Toto becomes distracted by a cat and leaps from Dorothy's arms. As Dorothy pursues Toto, the balloon disembarks with the Wizard, leaving her behind. Glinda appears and tells Dorothy that the ruby slippers have the power to return her to Kansas. After sharing a tearful farewell with Scarecrow, Tin Man, and Lion, Dorothy follows Glinda's instructions: she must close her eyes, tap her heels together three times, and state repeatedly, \"There's no place like home.\" Dorothy complies and she wakes up in her bedroom surrounded by her family and friends, including Toto.  Everyone dismisses her adventure as a dream, but Dorothy insists it was real and says she will never run away from home again before declaring, \"There's no place like home!\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{For|a list of all the munchkin actors/actresses in the film|Munchkin#Actors and actresses}} <!--There were a-lot of roles with the munchkin characters-->\n\n[[File:The Wizard of Oz Lahr Garland Bolger Haley 1939.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8| The [[Cowardly Lion]], [[Dorothy Gale|Dorothy]], [[Scarecrow (Oz)|The Scarecrow]], and [[Tin Woodman|The Tin Man]] are the film's main characters.]]\nCast listing:\n* [[Judy Garland]] as [[Dorothy Gale]]\n* [[Frank Morgan]] as (in order of appearance) Professor Marvel/The Gatekeeper/The Carriage Driver/The Guard/[[Wizard of Oz (character)|The Wizard of Oz]]\n* [[Ray Bolger]] as \"Hunk\" / [[Scarecrow (Oz)|The Scarecrow]]\n* [[Jack Haley]] as \"Hickory\" / [[Tin Woodman|The Tin Man]]\n* [[Bert Lahr]] as \"Zeke\" / The [[Cowardly Lion]]\n* [[Billie Burke]] as [[Glinda the Good Witch|Glinda]]\n* [[Margaret Hamilton (actress)|Margaret Hamilton]] as Miss Almira Gulch / [[Wicked Witch of the West|The Wicked Witch of the West]]\n* [[Charley Grapewin]] as [[Uncle Henry (Oz)|Uncle Henry]]\n* [[Pat Walshe]] as Nikko the [[Winged monkeys|Winged Monkey]] King\n* [[Clara Blandick]] as [[Auntie Em]]\n* [[Terry (dog)|Terry]] as [[Toto (Oz)|Toto]]\n* [[Mitchell Lewis]] as the Winkie Guard Captain (credited only in the [[IMAX]] version)\n* [[Adriana Caselotti]] as the voice of [[Juliet]] in the Tin Man's song \"[[If I Only Had a Heart]]\" (uncredited)<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/obituary-adriana-caselotti-1277975.html |title=Obituary: Adriana Caselotti |last=Sibley |first=Brian |date=February 10, 1997 |newspaper=The Independent |location=London |access-date=October 8, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nProduction on the film began when [[Walt Disney]]'s ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'' (1937) showed that films adapted from popular children's stories and fairytale folklore could still be successful.<ref name=\"Fricke2\">{{Cite book |title=The Wizard of Oz: The Official 50th Anniversary Pictorial History |last=Fricke |first=John |authorlink=John Fricke |last2=Scarfone |first2=Jay |last3=Stillman |first3=William |year=1986 |publisher=Warner Books, Inc. |location=New York, NY |isbn=978-0-446-51446-0 |page=[https://archive.org/details/wizardofozoffici0000fric/page/18 18] |url=https://archive.org/details/wizardofozoffici0000fric/page/18 }}</ref><ref name=\"TheMakingOfAMovieClassic\" /> In January 1938, [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] bought the rights to L. Frank Baum\u2019s [[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz|hugely popular novel]] from [[Samuel Goldwyn]], who had toyed with the idea of making the film as a vehicle for [[Eddie Cantor]] who was under contract to the Goldwyn studios and whom Goldwyn wanted to cast as the Scarecrow.<ref name=\"TheMakingOfAMovieClassic\" />\n\nThe script went through several writers and revisions before the final shooting.<ref name=\"Harmetz\" /> [[Mervyn LeRoy]]'s assistant, [[William Cannon (director)|William H. Cannon]], had submitted a brief four-page outline.<ref name=\"Harmetz\" /> Because recent fantasy films had not fared well, he recommended toning down or removing the magical elements of the story. In his outline, the Scarecrow was a man so stupid that the only employment open to him was literally scaring crows from cornfields, while the Tin Woodman was a criminal so heartless he was sentenced to be placed in a tin suit for eternity, torture that softened him into somebody gentler and kinder.<ref name=\"Harmetz\" /> His vision was similar to [[Larry Semon]]'s [[The Wizard of Oz (1925 film)|1925 film adaptation]] of the story in which the magical elements are absent.\n\nAfterward, LeRoy hired screenwriter [[Herman J. Mankiewicz]], who soon delivered a 17-page draft of the Kansas scenes and a few weeks later, a further 56 pages. He also hired [[Noel Langley]] and poet [[Ogden Nash]] to write separate versions of the story. None of these three knew about the others, and this was not an uncommon procedure. Nash delivered a four-page outline, Langley turned in a 43-page treatment and a full film script. He{{who|date=August 2017}} turned in three more, this time incorporating the songs that had been written by [[Harold Arlen]] and [[Yip Harburg]]. [[Florence Ryerson]] and [[Edgar Allan Woolf]] submitted a script and were brought on board to touch up the writing. They would be responsible for making sure the story stayed true to the Baum book.

Because of a perceived need to attract a youthful audience through appealing to modern fads and styles, the score had featured a song called \"The Jitterbug\", and the script had featured a scene with a series of musical contests. A spoiled, selfish princess in Oz had outlawed all forms of music except classical and [[operetta]] and went up against Dorothy in a singing contest in which her swing style enchanted listeners and won the grand prize. This part was initially written for [[Betty Jaynes (actress)|Betty Jaynes]].<ref>{{Cite book| last = Fordin | first = Hugh | title = World of Entertainment | publisher = Avon Books  | location =  | year = 1976 | isbn = 978-0-380-00754-7 }}</ref> The plan was later dropped.\n\nAnother scene, which was removed before final script approval and never filmed, was an epilogue scene back in Kansas after Dorothy's return. Hunk (the Kansan counterpart to the Scarecrow) is leaving for an agricultural college and extracts a promise from Dorothy to write to him. The scene implies that romance will eventually develop between the two, which also may have been intended as an explanation for Dorothy's partiality for the Scarecrow over her other two companions. This plot idea was never totally dropped, but is especially noticeable in the final script when Dorothy, just before she is to leave Oz, tells the Scarecrow, \"I think I'll miss you most of all.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1001433010|title=Hollywood Reporter|date= October 20, 2005 }} {{Dead link|date=February 2012|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}</ref>\n\nMuch attention was given to the use of color in the production, with the MGM production crew favoring some hues over others.

Officially, the decision to cast Garland was attributed to contractual issues.\n\n[[File:Buddy Ebsen Tin Man.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Ebsen's costume test as the Tin Man]]\n[[Ray Bolger]] was originally cast as the Tin Man and [[Buddy Ebsen]] was to play the Scarecrow.<ref name=\"timeline\" /> Bolger, however, longed to play the Scarecrow, as his childhood idol [[Fred Stone]] had done [[The Wizard of Oz (1902 musical)|on stage in 1902]]; with that very performance, Stone had inspired him to become a vaudevillian in the first place. Now unhappy with his role as the Tin Man (reportedly claiming, \"I'm not a tin performer; I'm fluid\"), Bolger convinced producer Mervyn LeRoy to recast him in the part he so desired.<ref name=\"cemeteryguide.com\">[http://www.cemeteryguide.com/bolger.html Cemetery Guide, ''Hollywood Remains to Be Seen'', Mark Masek].</ref> Ebsen did not object; after going over the basics of the Scarecrow's distinctive gait with Bolger (as a professional dancer, Ebsen had been cast because the studio was confident he would be up to the task of replicating the famous \"wobbly-walk\" of Stone's Scarecrow), he recorded all of his songs, went through all the rehearsals as the Tin Man and began filming with the rest of the cast.<ref>Fricke, John and Scarfone and William Stillman. ''The Wizard of Oz: The Official 50th Anniversary Pictorial History'', Warner Books, 1989</ref>\n\n[[Bert Lahr]] was signed for the Cowardly Lion on July 25, 1938; the next month, [[Charles Grapewin]] was cast as Uncle Henry on August 12.\n\n[[W. C. Fields]] was originally chosen for the title role of the Wizard, a role turned down by [[Ed Wynn]] as he thought the part was too small, but the studio ran out of patience after protracted haggling over Fields' fee. [[Wallace Beery]] lobbied for the role, but the studio refused to spare him during the long shooting schedule. Instead, another contract player, [[Frank Morgan]], was cast on September 22.\n\nAn extensive talent search produced over a hundred [[Dwarfism|little people]] to play Munchkins; this meant that most of the film's Oz sequences would have to already be shot before work on the Munchkinland sequence could begin. According to Munchkin actor [[Jerry Maren]], the little people were each paid over $125 a week (equivalent to ${{Inflation|index=US|value=125|start_year=1938|r=-2|fmt=c}} today). [[Meinhardt Raabe]], who played the coroner, revealed in the 1990 documentary ''The Making of the Wizard of Oz'' that the MGM costume and wardrobe department, under the direction of designer [[Adrian (costume designer)|Adrian]], had to design over 100 costumes for the Munchkin sequences. They then had to photograph and catalog each Munchkin in his or her costume so that they could correctly apply the same costume and makeup each day of production.\n\n[[Gale Sondergaard]] was originally cast as the Wicked Witch. She became unhappy when the witch's persona shifted from sly and glamorous (thought to emulate the wicked queen in Disney's ''Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs'') into the familiar \"ugly hag\". She turned down the role and was replaced on October 10, 1938, just three days before filming started, by MGM contract player [[Margaret Hamilton (actress)|Margaret Hamilton]]. Sondergaard said in an interview for a bonus feature on the [[DVD]] that she had no regrets about turning down the part, and would go on to play a glamorous villainess in Fox's version of [[Maurice Maeterlinck]]'s ''[[The Blue Bird (1940 film)|The Blue Bird]]'' in 1940; Margaret Hamilton played a role remarkably similar to the Wicked Witch in the Judy Garland film ''[[Babes in Arms (film)|Babes in Arms]]'' (1939).\n\nAccording to Aljean Harmetz, the \"gone-to-seed\" coat worn by Morgan as the wizard was selected from a rack of coats purchased from a second-hand shop. According to legend, Morgan later discovered a label in the coat indicating it had once belonged to Baum, that Baum's widow confirmed this, and that the coat was eventually presented to her. But Baum biographer [[Michael Patrick Hearn]] says the Baum family denies ever seeing the coat or knowing of the story; Hamilton considered it a concocted studio rumor.<ref>[[Michael Patrick Hearn|Hearn, Michael Patrick]].

Thorpe initially shot about two weeks of footage, nine days in total, involving Dorothy's first encounter with the Scarecrow, as well as a number of sequences in the Wicked Witch's castle, such as Dorothy's rescue, which, though unreleased, comprises the only footage of [[Buddy Ebsen]]'s Tin Man.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Practical PHP and MySQL web site databases : a simplified approach|last=West, Adrian W.|isbn=978-1430260776|location=New York|oclc=859580733|year=2014}}</ref>\n\n==== Ebsen replaced by Haley ====\nThe production faced the challenge of simulating the Tin Man's costume.

The first take ran well, but in the second take, the burst of fire came too soon as a result of which the flames set fire to her green and copper-based face paint, causing third-degree burns on her hands and face. She spent three months healing before returning to work.<ref>{{Cite book|title=History of Movie Musicals|last=Aylesworth|first=Thomas|publisher=Gallery Books|year=1984|isbn=978-0-8317-4467-0|location=New York City|pages=[https://archive.org/details/historyofmoviemu0000ayle/page/97 97]|url=https://archive.org/details/historyofmoviemu0000ayle/page/97}}</ref>\n\n====King Vidor's finishing work as director====\nOn February 12, 1939, Fleming hastily replaced Cukor in directing ''Gone with the Wind''; the next day, Fleming's friend [[King Vidor]] was assigned as director by the studio in order to finish the filming of ''The Wizard of Oz'' (mainly the early sepia-toned Kansas sequences, including Garland's singing of \"[[Over the Rainbow]]\" and the [[tornado]]). When the film became a hit in 1939, Vidor chose not to take public credit for his contribution until the death of his friend Fleming in 1949.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\n===Special effects, makeup and costumes===\n[[A. Arnold Gillespie|Arnold Gillespie]] was the [[special effect]]s director for the film. Gillespie worked with the production using five of six visual effects categories for the movie.<ref name=\"Care 45\u201347\"/> To develop the [[tornado]] scene was especially costly. Gillespie used [[muslin]] cloth to make the tornado flexible after a previous attempt with [[rubber]] failed. He hung the 35 feet of muslin from a steel [[gantry crane|gantry]] and connected the bottom to a rod. By moving the gantry and rod, he was able to create the illusion of a tornado moving across the stage. [[Fuller's earth]] was sprayed from both the top and bottom using compressed air hoses to complete the effect.

The music was composed by [[Harold Arlen]], and the lyrics were written by [[Yip Harburg]], both of whom won the [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]] for \"Over the Rainbow\". The song was ranked first in two lists: the [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Songs]] and the [[Recording Industry Association of America]]'s \"[[Songs of the Century|365 Songs of the Century]]\".\n\nMGM composer [[Herbert Stothart]], a well-known Hollywood composer and songwriter, won the [[Academy Award for Best Original Score]] in recognition of his original score.\n\n[[Georgie Stoll]] was associate conductor and screen credit was given to [[George Bassman]], [[Murray Cutter]], [[Ken Darby]] and Paul Marquardt for orchestral and vocal arrangements (as usual, Roger Edens was also heavily involved as an unbilled musical associate to Freed.)\n\nThe songs were recorded in the studio's scoring stage before filming. Several of the recordings were completed while Ebsen was still with the cast. Therefore, while he had to be dropped from the cast due to illness from the aluminum powder makeup, his singing voice remained in the soundtrack (as noted in the notes for the CD Deluxe Edition). In the group vocals of \"We're Off to See the Wizard\", his voice can be heard. Haley spoke with a distinct [[Boston accent]], thus did not pronounce the ''r'' in ''wizard''. By contrast, Ebsen was a [[Midwestern United States|Midwesterner]], like Garland, and pronounced it. Haley rerecorded Ebsen's solo parts later.\n\nBolger's original recording of \"[[If I Only Had a Brain]]\" had been far more sedate compared to the version heard in the film; during the filming, Cukor and LeRoy decided that a more energetic rendition would better suit Dorothy's initial meeting with the Scarecrow and the song was rerecorded as such. At first thought to be lost, a copy of the original version was discovered in 2009.<ref>[http://www.thejudyroom.com/news-oz.html#brain The Wizard of Oz 70th Anniversary News<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110513210807/http://www.thejudyroom.com/news-oz.html#brain |date=May 13, 2011 }}</ref>\n\n====Song list====\n* \"[[Over the Rainbow]]\" \u2013 Judy Garland as Dorothy Gale\n* Munchkinland Sequence:\n** \"Come Out&nbsp;{{nbsp}}...\" \u2013 Billie Burke as Glinda, and the Munchkins\n** \"It Really Was No Miracle\" \u2013 Judy Garland as Dorothy, Billy Bletcher and the Munchkins\n** \"We Thank You Very Sweetly\" \u2013 Frank Cucksey and Joseph Koziel\n** \"[[Ding-Dong!

Hail! The Witch is Dead!\", sung upon the return to the Emerald City]]\nSome musical pieces filmed were deleted in the editing process.\n\nThe song \"The Jitterbug\", written in a swing style, was intended for the sequence in which the group is journeying to the Witch's castle. Due to time constraints, the song was cut from the final theatrical version. The film footage for the song has been lost, although silent home film footage of rehearsals for the number has survived. The sound recording for the song, however, is intact and was included in the two-CD [[Rhino Entertainment|Rhino Records]] deluxe edition of the film soundtrack, as well as on the VHS and DVD editions of the film. A reference to \"The Jitterbug\" remains in the film: the Witch remarks to her flying monkeys that they should have no trouble apprehending Dorothy and her friends because \"I've sent a little insect on ahead to take the fight out of them.\"\n\nAnother musical number cut before release occurred right after the Wicked Witch of the West was melted and before Dorothy and her friends returned to the Wizard. This was a reprise of \"Ding-Dong! The Witch Is Dead\" (blended with \"[[We're Off to See the Wizard]]\" and \"The Merry Old Land of Oz\") with the lyrics altered to \"Hail! Hail! The Witch is Dead!\" This started with the Witch's guard saying \"Hail to Dorothy! The Wicked Witch is dead!\" and dissolved to a huge celebration of the citizens of the Emerald City singing the song as they accompany Dorothy and her friends to see the Wizard. Today, the film of this scene is also lost and only a few stills survive, along with a few seconds of footage used on several reissue trailers. The entire audio still exists and is included on the two-CD Rhino Record deluxe edition of the film soundtrack.<ref>''The Wizard of Oz: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack \u2013 The Deluxe Edition'', 2-CD set, original recording remastered, [[Rhino Entertainment|Rhino Records]] # 71964 (July 18, 1995)</ref>\n\nIn addition, a brief reprise of \"Over the Rainbow\" was intended to be sung by Garland while Dorothy is trapped in the Witch's castle, but it was cut because it was considered too emotionally intense. The original soundtrack recording still exists, however, and was included as an extra in all home media releases from 1993 onwards.<ref>Warner Bros. 2005 ''The Wizard of Oz'' Deluxe DVD edition, program notes and audio extras.</ref>\n\n====Underscoring====\nExtensive edits in the film's final cut removed vocals from the last portion of the film. However, the film was fully [[Underscoring|underscored]], with instrumental snippets from the film's various [[leitmotif]]s throughout. There was also some recognizable popular music, including:\n* Excerpts from [[Robert Schumann|Schumann]]'s \"The Happy Farmer\", at several points early in the film, including the opening scene when Dorothy and Toto are hurrying home after their encounter with Miss Gulch, when Toto escapes from her, and when the house is \"riding\" the tornado.\n* An excerpt of [[Felix Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn]]'s \"Opus 16, #2\", when Toto escapes from the Witch's castle.\n* An excerpt of [[Modest Mussorgsky|Mussorgsky]]'s \"[[Night on Bald Mountain]]\", when Dorothy, the Scarecrow, the Tin Man, and the Cowardly Lion are trying to escape from the Witch's castle.\n* \"[[In the Shade of the Old Apple Tree]]\", when Dorothy and the Scarecrow discover the anthropomorphic apple trees.\n* \"[[Gaudeamus Igitur]]\" during the Wizard's presentation of awards to the group.\n* \"[[Home! Sweet Home!]]\", in part of the underscore of the closing scene, at Dorothy's house in Kansas.\n\n(The above list is excerpted from the liner notes on the Rhino Records collection.)\n\n===Post-production===\n[[Principal photography]] concluded with the Kansas sequences on March 16, 1939; nonetheless, reshoots and pick-up shots were filmed throughout April and May and into June, under the direction of producer LeRoy. After the deletion of the \"Over the Rainbow\" reprise during subsequent test screenings in early June, Garland had to be brought back one more time to reshoot the \"Auntie Em, I'm frightened!\" scene without the song; the footage of Blandick's Aunt Em, as shot by Vidor, had already been set aside for rear-projection work, and was simply reused.\n\nAfter Hamilton's torturous experience with the Munchkinland elevator, she refused to do the pick-ups for the scene in which she flies on a broomstick that billows smoke, so LeRoy chose to have stand-in Betty Danko perform the scene, instead; as a result, Danko was severely injured doing the scene due to a malfunction in the smoke mechanism.<ref>''The Making of the Wizard of Oz \u2013 Movie Magic and Studio Power in the Prime of MGM \u2013 and the Miracle of Production #1060'', 10th Edition, Bantam Doubleday Dell Publishing Group, Inc./Random House, 1989.</ref>\n\nAt this point, the film began a long arduous post-production. [[Herbert Stothart]] had to compose the film's background score, while [[A. Arnold Gillespie]] had to perfect the various special effects that the film required, including many of the rear projection shots. The MGM art department also had to create the various matte paintings for the background of many of the scenes.\n\nOne significant innovation planned for the film was the use of stencil printing for the transition to Technicolor. Each frame was to be hand-tinted to maintain the sepia tone; however, because this was too expensive and labor-intensive, it was abandoned and MGM used a simpler and less expensive variation of the process. During the reshoots in May, the inside of the farm house was painted sepia, and when Dorothy opens the door, it is not Garland, but her stand-in, Bobbie Koshay, wearing a sepia gingham dress, who then backs out of frame; once the camera moves through the door, Garland steps back into frame in her bright blue gingham dress (as noted in DVD extras), and the sepia-painted door briefly tints her with the same color before she emerges from the house's shadow, into the bright glare of the Technicolor lighting. This also meant that the reshoots provided the first proper shot of Munchkinland; if one looks carefully, the brief cut to Dorothy looking around outside the house bisects a single long shot, from the inside of the doorway to the pan-around that finally ends in a reverse-angle as the ruins of the house are seen behind Dorothy as she comes to a stop at the foot of the small bridge.\n\n[[Test screening]]s of the film began on June 5, 1939.<ref name=\"geo\">{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/Hollywood/Hills/6396/timeline.htm|title=\"The Wizard of Oz\"...&nbsp;A Movie Timeline|author=Jim's \"Wizard of Oz\" Website Directory|publisher=geocities.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071114114015/http://www.geocities.com/Hollywood/Hills/6396/timeline.htm|archivedate=November 14, 2007|accessdate=September 10, 2007}}</ref> ''Oz'' initially ran nearly two hours long. LeRoy and Fleming knew that at least 15 minutes needed to be deleted to get the film down to a manageable running time; the average film in 1939 ran for just about 90 minutes. Three sneak previews in [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]], [[Pomona, California|Pomona]] and [[San Luis Obispo, California]], helped guide LeRoy and Fleming in the cutting. Among the many cuts were \"The Jitterbug\" number, the Scarecrow's elaborate dance sequence following \"If I Only Had a Brain\", reprises of \"Over the Rainbow\" and \"[[Ding-Dong! The Witch Is Dead]]\", and a number of smaller dialogue sequences. This left the final, mostly serious portion of the film with no songs, only the dramatic underscoring.\n\nOne song that was almost deleted was \"Over the Rainbow\". MGM had felt that it made the Kansas sequence too long, as well as being far over the heads of the target audience of children. The studio also thought that it was degrading for Garland to sing in a barnyard. LeRoy, uncredited associate producer Arthur Freed and director Fleming fought to keep it in, and they eventually won. The song went on to win the [[Academy Award]] for Best Song of the Year, and came to be identified so strongly with Garland herself that she made it her theme song.\n\nAfter the preview in San Luis Obispo in early July, the film was officially released in August 1939 at its current 101-minute running time.\n\n==Release==\n[[File:Wizard of Oz (Oconomowoc) cropped.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|A memorial commemorating the film's world premiere at the Strand Theatre in [[Oconomowoc, Wisconsin]] on August 12, 1939]]\n\nThe film premiered at the Orpheum Theatre in [[Green Bay, Wisconsin]] on August 10, 1939.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/moviedetails/7892|title=AFI{{!}}Catalog|website=catalog.afi.com|access-date=2019-09-03}}</ref> The film's first sneak preview was held in [[San Bernardino, California]].<ref>Down The Yellow Brick Road: The Making of The Wizard Of Oz\"McClelland, 1976 Publisher Pyramid Publications (Harcourt Brace Jonavich)</ref>\nThe film was previewed in three [[test market]]s: on August 11, 1939, at [[Kenosha, Wisconsin]] and [[Dennis, Massachusetts]],<ref>{{cite web| title= Hello, yellow brick road | url= http://www.jsonline.com/news/waukesha/51361182.html | date= July 21, 2009 | first= Scott|last= Williams | publisher= [[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]] | accessdate=October 21, 2011| quote=John Fricke, a historian who has written books about ''The Wizard of Oz'', said that MGM executives arranged advance screenings in a handful of small communities to find out how audiences would respond to the musical adventure, which cost nearly $3 million to produce.

Nor can they, without a few betraying jolts and split-screen overlappings, bring down from the sky the great soap bubble in which Glinda rides and roll it smoothly into place.<ref name=\"nyt1939\"/>\n</blockquote>\nAccording to Nugent, \"Judy Garland's Dorothy is a pert and fresh-faced miss with the wonder-lit eyes of a believer in fairy tales, but the Baum fantasy is at its best when the Scarecrow, the Tin Man, and the Lion are on the move.\"<ref name=\"nyt1939\"/>\n\nWriting in ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', John C. Flinn predicted that the film was \"likely to perform some record-breaking feats of box-office magic,\" noting, \"Some of the scenic passages are so beautiful in design and composition as to stir audiences by their sheer unfoldment.\" He also called Garland \"an appealing figure\" and the musical numbers \"gay and bright.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://variety.com/1939/film/reviews/the-wizard-of-oz-3-1200412289/ |title=Review: 'The Wizard of Oz' |last=Flinn |first=John C. |date=August 16, 1939 |website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |accessdate=September 22, 2015 }}</ref>\n\n''[[Harrison's Reports]]'' wrote, \"Even though some persons are not interested in pictures of this type, it is possible that they will be eager to see this picture just for its technical treatment.

While these were considerable earnings, the high production cost, in association with various distribution and other costs, meant the movie initially recorded a loss of $1,145,000 for the studio.<ref name=\"Mannix\"/> It did not show what MGM considered a profit until a 1949 re-release earned an additional $1.5 million (about ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|1.5|1949|r=0}}}} million today). However, for all the risks and cost that MGM undertook to produce the film, it was considered at least more successful than anyone thought it would be. According to Christopher Finch, author of the Judy Garland biography ''Rainbow: The Stormy Life of Judy Garland'', \"Fantasy is always a risk at the box office. The film had been enormously successful as a book, and it had also been a major stage hit, but previous attempts to bring it to the screen had been dismal failures.\" Finch also writes that after the success of the film, Garland signed a new contract with MGM giving her a substantial increase in salary, making her one of the top-ten box office stars in the United States.<ref>{{cite book |last=Finch |first=Christofer |title=Rainbow: The Stormy Life Of Judy Garland |year=1975 |publisher=Ballantine Books |isbn=978-0-345-28407-5 |page=84}}</ref>\n\n===Awards and honors===\n\n====Academy Awards====\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"95%\"\n|- style=\"background:#ccc; text-align:center;\"\n! colspan=\"5\" style=\"background: LightSteelBlue;\" | Awards\n|- style=\"background:#ccc; text-align:center;\"\n!
