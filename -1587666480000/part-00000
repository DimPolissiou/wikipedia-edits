In 1954, Chitepo became Rhodesia's second black lawyer after Prince Nguboyenja Khumalo son of King Lobengula (a special law was required to allow him to occupy chambers with white colleagues).<ref>Time Magazine, 31 March 1975</ref> On returning to Rhodesia in 1954, he practised as a lawyer and defended African nationalists such as [[Ndabaningi Sithole]] in court. In February 1960, he traveled to the US with support from the African-American Institute. [Ilanga Lasa Natal Ngomgqibelo (Saturday), February 27, 1960.]  In 1961, he served as legal adviser to [[Joshua Nkomo]], founder of the [[ZAPU|Zimbabwe African Peoples Union]] (ZAPU), at the Southern Rhodesia Constitutional Conference in London. In the same year, he was also appointed to the Board of Governors of [[Bernard Mizeki College]] along with [[Sir. W. C .R. Honey]] and [[Sir Robert Tredgold]]. The Southern Rhodesian government did not detain him, as he did not come out in the open as an official of the nationalist movement, and the regime also feared that he was too internationally well known to be locked up.\n\n==ZANU==\nIn May 1962 [[ZAPU]] was banned because of [[militarism]] and Chitepo was persuaded to go into voluntary exile to escape possible detention. He became [[Tanganyika]]'s first African Director of Public Prosecutions. The [[Ndabaningi Sithole]] and [[Joshua Nkomo]] factions of ZAPU split apart in July 1963. Nkomo's supporters founded the PCC-ZAPU (later just called ZAPU again) and favoured a more militaristic approach. As the more moderate faction, Chitepo sided with Sithole and was elected Chairman of ZANU ( having defeated [[Nathan Shamuyarira]] ) from its foundation. He held this post until 7 December 1974, when the [[Lusaka Accord]] was signed.\n\nBoth parties vied for domination but in 1964 both were banned and the leaders were all arrested. Both parties chose to leave the country and reorganise and form armies from outside Rhodesian borders, although they chose different countries to make their base. ZAPU based itself in the West and [[Zambia]] where it organised ZIPRA (the [[Zimbabwe People's Revolutionary Army]].) They allied with the [[Soviet Union]] and organised a vanguard of highly trained soldiers. ZANU, however, moved into [[Tanzania]] and then to [[Mozambique]] and set up ZANLA ([[Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army]]) which concentrated more on mobilising the masses in the countryside in a method pioneered by the Chinese.\n\nIn January 1966 Chitepo resigned as Director of Public Prosecutions and moved to [[Zambia]] to concentrate on the armed struggle. He toured world capitals canvassing support for [[ZANU]] and for the enforcement of total economic sanctions against Rhodesia. With his friendly disposition, he was very effective and earned for ZANU international recognition and respect.\n\nSithole and others prepared a comprehensive document giving powers to Chitepo to lead ZANU while Rev. Sithole was in detention and specifically authorising him to carry out the armed struggle. Accordingly, Herbert Chitepo with the military supremo [[Josiah Tongogara]] from the Karanga ethnic community, organised and planned successful military guerilla attacks and underground activities in Rhodesia from 1966 onwards. In 1972, he co-ordinated war operations with FRELIMO and opened up the north eastern region of Zimbabwe as a new and effective war front.\n\n==Assassination==\nChitepo died on 18 March 1975 in [[Lusaka]], [[Zambia]] when a car bomb, placed in his Volkswagen Beetle the night before, exploded. He and Silas Shamiso, one of his bodyguards, were killed instantly. Sadat Kufamadzuba, his other bodyguard, was injured. The explosion sent part of the car onto the roof of his house and uprooted a tree next door. Hours later one of his neighbours died of injuries he sustained in the explosion.<ref name=\"details\">White, Luise. ''The Assassination of Herbert Chitepo: Texts and Politics in Zimbabwe.''

However, in his biographical account, ''The Legend of The Selous Scouts'', Lt Col [[Ronald Reid-Daly]], Officer Commanding, [[Selous Scouts|Selous Scouts Regiment]], Rhodesian Security Forces, clearly states that the Rhodesian [[Central Intelligence Organization]] (CIO) under the leadership of Director General [[Ken Flower]], masterminded the assassination of Herbert Chitepo, subsequently planting documentary evidence blaming ZANU members.\n\n\"The decision by Ken Flower...to assassinate Herbert Chitepo, head of the ZANU War Council, now showed how badly Flower has misread the ZANU/ZANLA situation.

As well as serving in this role it also provided field and specialist engineer units in both World Wars. Its successors continued to serve in the [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]] until 1991.\n\n==Precursor unit==\nAs early as 1870 a government defence committee recommended that coastal artillery batteries defending British seaports should be supplemented by [[Controlled mines|fixed minefields]] fired electrically from the shore, but it was not until the 1880s that this was acted upon. [[Andrew Clarke (British Army officer, born 1824)|Lieutenant-General Sir Andrew Clarke]], the Inspector-General of Fortifications 1882\u20136, found that he did not have enough Regular [[Royal Engineers]] (RE) to man these additional defences, so he utilised the [[Volunteer Force (Great Britain)|Volunteer]] Engineers for this task. After successful trials the system was rolled out to ports around the country.<ref name = Norfolk>Norfolk, pp. 38\u20139.</ref><ref>Beckett, pp. 184\u20135.</ref><ref>Short ''et al.'', pp. 1\u20134.</ref> In 1886 a meeting held at the instigation of [[Albert Rollit|Sir Albert Rollit]] agreed to form a corps of Volunteer Submarine Miners in [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]] to man the defences of the [[Humber Estuary]].

Some time after December 1941 the unit was converted into '''542nd Electrical and Mechanical Company, RE'''. Whereas the [[Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers]] (formed in 1942) maintained vehicles and complex weapons and equipment, the RE's E&M companies worked with heavy electrical engineering plant, such as generators and pumps. In December 1942 the company landed in North Africa with [[First Army (United Kingdom)|First Army]] ([[Operation Torch]]), transferring to [[Allied Forces Headquarters]] in February 1943. Later in the year it moved to Italy.<ref name = W&R169>Watson & Rinaldi, pp. 169, 186.</ref>\n\n===Italy===\nDuring the [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italian Campaign]] the re-establishment of electric power supplies was critical. Power stations in the south of the country were quickly captured intact, but north of [[Naples]] and [[Foggia]] the Germans had destroyed everything to do with electricity supply: power stations, sub-stations, hydro-electric dam sluices, transmission lines and pylons were all wrecked. Repair was a collaborative effort of the British Royal Engineers and [[Royal Navy]] with US and Italian engineers, under an Electric Power Committee set up in December 1943. Once the Allies reached Rome in mid-1944 they discovered that less than 10 per cent of the 800,000&nbsp;kW generating capacity of central Italy was in working order. Over the succeeding months 542nd E&M Company was engaged in re-establishing transmission lines, alongside 540th (formerly the [[Renfrewshire Fortress Royal Engineers|Renfrewshire Fortress Engineers]]), 541st (formerly the North Riding Fortress Engineers), 543rd and 544th (Palestinian) E&M Companies.<ref>Pakenham-Walsh, pp. 30, 73\u20134.</ref>\n\nThe company was disbanded after September 1945.<ref name = W&R169/>\n\n==Postwar==\nWhen the TA was reconstituted in 1947, the East Riding Fortress Engineers were reformed as '''542 (East Riding) Construction Squadron''' in [[North Riding Fortress Royal Engineers|118 Construction Regiment]] (itself descended from the North Riding Fortress Engineers).<ref name = W&R294>Watson & Rinaldi, pp. 294, 296.</ref><ref name=542on>[http://british-army-units1945on.co.uk/territorial-army-royal-engineers/squadrons-337-to-575.html 337\u2013575 RE Sqns at British Army 1945 on.]</ref><ref name=118on>[http://british-army-units1945on.co.uk/territorial-army-royal-engineers/regiments-118-432-territorial-army.html 118\u2013432 RE Rgts at British Army 1945 on.]</ref><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20051118222359/http://regiments.org/regiments/uk/volmil-england/vengr/yn-tees.htm North Riding Fortress Engineers at Regiments.org.]</ref>\n\nWhen the TA was reorganised in 1961, 542 Sqn was transferred as a field squadron to 129 Corps Engineer Regiment.<ref name = W&R294/><ref name = 542on/><ref name = 118on/> Then when the TA was converted into the [[Army Reserve (United Kingdom)|TAVR]] in 1967, 129 Regt was reduced to a single [[East Riding Royal Garrison Artillery#422 .28East Riding Coast.29 Squadron|129 (East Riding) Field Squadron]] based at Hull, and included in a new 72 ([[Tyne Electrical Engineers]]) Engineer Regiment.<ref name = W&R314>Watson & Rinaldi, pp. 314\u20135.</ref>\n<ref name = Sappers>[http://www.sappers.co.uk/squadrons/ta-72-engineer-regt-volunteers 72 Engineer Rgt at Sappers site.]</ref><ref name=Regts72>[https://web.archive.org/web/20051126065713/http://regiments.org/regiments/uk/vols-tavr/art-eng-sig/engr72.htm 72 Engineer Rgt at Regiments.org]</ref> In 1977 the squadron was transferred again, this time to 73 Engineer Regiment.<ref name = W&R314/><ref name = Sappers/><ref name = Regts72/><ref name=Regts73>[https://web.archive.org/web/20051227044404/http://regiments.org/regiments/uk/vols-tavr/art-eng-sig/engr73.htm 73 Engineer Rgt at Regiments.org]</ref> Finally, it was broken up in April 1991, with part going to the Humber Artillery Company of 2nd Battalion [[Yorkshire Volunteers]], and part to [[131 Commando Squadron Royal Engineers]].<ref name = W&R314/><ref name = Regts73/><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20051126064353/http://regiments.org/regiments/uk/volmil-england/varty/ye-n2.htm Humber Artillery at Regiments.org]</ref>\n\n129 Field Sqn was reformed in April 2006, but disbanded again in 2014 under the 'Army 2020' proposals, when 73 Engineer Rgt was reduced to a single squadron.<ref name = W&R314/>\n\n==Prominent members==\n* The Scottish archaeologist [[Charles S.

[[Andrew Clarke (British Army officer)|Lieutenant-General Sir Andrew Clarke]], the Inspector-General of Fortifications 1882\u20136, found that he did not have enough Regular [[Royal Engineers]] (RE) to man these additional defences, so he utilised the [[Volunteer Force (Great Britain)|Volunteer]] Engineers for this task.

Later a barrage line of lights was organised up the East Coast with the East Riding Fortress Engineers providing  '''No 39 AA Company''' at [[North Killingholme|Killingholme]], while Hull was protected by No 38 AA Company and East Riding personnel guarding [[Sheffield]] were relieved by No 40 AA Company, both manned by the [[Tyne Electrical Engineers]]. By May 1918 this formed part of Northern Air Defences (NAD). At this stage of the war the NAD was barely troubled by German raids, and most of the men of medical category A1 had been withdrawn from the AA defences and sent to join the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|British Expeditionary Force]] on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]]<ref>Short ''et al.'', pp. 128, 131, 139, 143, 151.</ref> All TF units were demobilised in 1919 after the [[Armistice with Germany]].\n\n==Interwar==\nThe East Riding (Fortress) Engineers, consisting of No 1 (Works) and Nos 2 and 3 (Lights) Companies, was reformed in the renamed [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]] (TA) in 1920, forming part of North Eastern Coastal Defences in [[50th (Northumbrian) Division|50th (Northumbrian) Divisional Area]], with its HQ still at Colonial St, Hull. However, by 1939 it had been reduced to a single Electric Light and Works company.<ref>''Titles and Designations'', 1927.</ref><ref>''Monthly Army List'', May 1939.</ref><ref>Watson & Rinaldi, p. 105.</ref>\n\n==Second World War==\n\n===Mobilisation===\nThe East Riding Fortress Engineers were mobilised in the Humber Coast defences on 3 September 1939. Some time after December 1941 the unit was converted into '''542nd Electrical and Mechanical Company, RE'''. Whereas the [[Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers]] (formed in 1942) maintained vehicles and complex weapons and equipment, the RE's E&M companies worked with heavy electrical engineering plant, such as generators and pumps. In December 1942 the company landed in North Africa with [[First Army (United Kingdom)|First Army]] ([[Operation Torch]]), transferring to [[Allied Forces Headquarters]] in February 1943. Later in the year it moved to Italy.<ref name = W&R169>Watson & Rinaldi, pp. 169, 186.</ref>\n\n===Italy===\nDuring the [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italian Campaign]] the re-establishment of electric power supplies was critical. Power stations in the south of the country were quickly captured intact, but north of [[Naples]] and [[Foggia]] the Germans had destroyed everything to do with electricity supply: power stations, sub-stations, hydro-electric dam sluices, transmission lines and pylons were all wrecked. Repair was a collaborative effort of the British Royal Engineers and [[Royal Navy]] with US and Italian engineers, under an Electric Power Committee set up in December 1943. Once the Allies reached Rome in mid-1944 they discovered that less than 10 per cent of the 800,000&nbsp;kW generating capacity of central Italy was in working order. Over the succeeding months 542nd E&M Company was engaged in re-establishing transmission lines, alongside 540th (formerly the [[Renfrewshire Fortress Royal Engineers|Renfrewshire Fortress Engineers]]), 541st (formerly the North Riding Fortress Engineers), 543rd and 544th (Palestinian) E&M Companies.<ref>Pakenham-Walsh, pp. 30, 73\u20134.</ref>\n\nThe company was disbanded after September 1945.<ref name = W&R169/>\n\n==Postwar==\nWhen the TA was reconstituted in 1947, the East Riding Fortress Engineers were reformed as '''542 (East Riding) Construction Squadron''' in [[North Riding Fortress Royal Engineers|118 Construction Regiment]] (itself descended from the North Riding Fortress Engineers).<ref name = W&R294>Watson & Rinaldi, pp. 294, 296.</ref><ref name=542on>[http://british-army-units1945on.co.uk/territorial-army-royal-engineers/squadrons-337-to-575.html 337\u2013575 RE Sqns at British Army 1945 on.]</ref><ref name=118on>[http://british-army-units1945on.co.uk/territorial-army-royal-engineers/regiments-118-432-territorial-army.html 118\u2013432 RE Rgts at British Army 1945 on.]</ref><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20051118222359/http://regiments.org/regiments/uk/volmil-england/vengr/yn-tees.htm North Riding Fortress Engineers at Regiments.org.]</ref>\n\nWhen the TA was reorganised in 1961, 542 Sqn was transferred as a field squadron to 129 Corps Engineer Regiment.<ref name = W&R294/><ref name = 542on/><ref name = 118on/> Then when the TA was converted into the [[Army Reserve (United Kingdom)|TAVR]] in 1967, 129 Regt was reduced to a single [[East Riding Royal Garrison Artillery#422 .28East Riding Coast.29 Squadron|129 (East Riding) Field Squadron]] based at Hull, and included in a new 72 ([[Tyne Electrical Engineers]]) Engineer Regiment.<ref name = W&R314>Watson & Rinaldi, pp. 314\u20135.</ref>\n<ref name = Sappers>[http://www.sappers.co.uk/squadrons/ta-72-engineer-regt-volunteers 72 Engineer Rgt at Sappers site.]</ref><ref name=Regts72>[https://web.archive.org/web/20051126065713/http://regiments.org/regiments/uk/vols-tavr/art-eng-sig/engr72.htm 72 Engineer Rgt at Regiments.org]</ref> In 1977 the squadron was transferred again, this time to 73 Engineer Regiment.<ref name = W&R314/><ref name = Sappers/><ref name = Regts72/><ref name=Regts73>[https://web.archive.org/web/20051227044404/http://regiments.org/regiments/uk/vols-tavr/art-eng-sig/engr73.htm 73 Engineer Rgt at Regiments.org]</ref> Finally, it was broken up in April 1991, with part going to the Humber Artillery Company of 2nd Battalion [[Yorkshire Volunteers]], and part to [[131 Commando Squadron Royal Engineers]].<ref name = W&R314/><ref name = Regts73/><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20051126064353/http://regiments.org/regiments/uk/volmil-england/varty/ye-n2.htm Humber Artillery at Regiments.org]</ref>\n\n129 Field Sqn was reformed in April 2006, but disbanded again in 2014 under the 'Army 2020' proposals, when 73 Engineer Rgt was reduced to a single squadron.<ref name = W&R314/>\n\n==Prominent members==\n* The Scottish archaeologist [[Charles S.

Since the nation's official debut in [[1960 Summer Olympics|1960]], Tunisian athletes have appeared in every edition of the [[Summer Olympic Games]], except the [[1980 Summer Olympics]] in Moscow because of the nation's partial support for the [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|US-led boycott]].\n\nThe [[Tunisian Olympic Committee]] ({{lang-fr|Comit\u00e9 National Olympique Tunisien, CNOT}}) fielded a team of 61 athletes, 40 men and 21 women, to compete in 17 sports at the Games.<ref>{{cite news|last=Chaouch|first=Rebecca|url=http://www.jeuneafrique.com/347255/societe/jo-2016-participation-de-tunisie-aux-jeux-olympiques-chiffres/|title=JO 2016 : la participation de la Tunisie aux Jeux Olympiques en chiffres|trans-title=2016 Olympics: Figures of Tunisia's participation at the Olympics|language=fr|publisher=[[Jeune Afrique]]|date=5 August 2016|accessdate=16 October 2016}}</ref> It was the nation's second-largest delegation sent to the Olympics, relatively smaller by 22 athletes than in London four years earlier.  [[Handball at the 2016 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's tournament|Men's handball]] was the only team-based sport in which Tunisia qualified for the Games. Among the sports represented by the nation's athletes, Tunisia made its Olympic debut in beach volleyball, as well as returning to table tennis after a twelve-year absence.\n\nThe Tunisian roster was highlighted by two accomplished Olympians from [[London 2012]]: long-distance swimmer [[Oussama Mellouli]] and steeplechaser [[Habiba Ghribi]]. At 32 years old and headed to his fifth Games, Mellouli emerged himself as Tunisia's most successful Olympian of all time, with three medals (two golds and one bronze), and the first swimmer to dominate at both the pool and open water in Olympic history.

Janeiro]], Brazil, from 5 to 21 August 2016. Since the nation's official debut in [[1960 Summer Olympics|1960]], Tunisian athletes have appeared in every edition of the [[Summer Olympic Games]], except the [[1980 Summer Olympics]] in Moscow because of the nation's partial support for the [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|US-led boycott]].\n\nThe [[Tunisian Olympic Committee]] ({{lang-fr|Comit\u00e9 National Olympique Tunisien, CNOT}}) fielded a team of 61 athletes, 40 men and 21 women, to compete in 17 sports at the Games.<ref>{{cite news|last=Chaouch|first=Rebecca|url=http://www.jeuneafrique.com/347255/societe/jo-2016-participation-de-tunisie-aux-jeux-olympiques-chiffres/|title=JO 2016 : la participation de la Tunisie aux Jeux Olympiques en chiffres|trans-title=2016 Olympics: Figures of Tunisia's participation at the Olympics|language=fr|publisher=[[Jeune Afrique]]|date=5 August 2016|accessdate=16 October 2016}}</ref> It was the nation's second-largest delegation sent to the Olympics, relatively smaller by 22 athletes than in London four years earlier.  [[Handball at the 2016 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's tournament|Men's handball]] was the only team-based sport in which Tunisia qualified for the Games. Among the sports represented by the nation's athletes, Tunisia made its Olympic debut in beach volleyball, as well as returning to table tennis after a twelve-year absence.\n\nThe Tunisian roster was highlighted by two accomplished Olympians from [[London 2012]]: long-distance swimmer [[Oussama Mellouli]] and steeplechaser [[Habiba Ghribi]]. At 32 years old and headed to his fifth Games, Mellouli emerged himself as Tunisia's most successful Olympian of all time, with three medals (two golds and one bronze), and the first swimmer to dominate at both the pool and open water in Olympic history. Because of his successes, Mellouli was selected to carry the nation's flag at the opening ceremony.<ref name=flag-bearer/><ref>{{cite news|url=http://stepfeed.com/more-categories/olympics/meet-egyptian-moroccan-tunisian-olympic-flag-bearers/|title=Meet the Egyptian, Moroccan, Tunisian Olympic flag-bearers|publisher=StepFeed|date=16 July 2016|accessdate=16 October 2016}}</ref> Meanwhile, Ghribi, a three-time Olympian, established a historic milestone for her country in London, when she became the first Tunisian woman to earn an Olympic medal.\n\nApart from Mellouli and Ghribi, 18 Tunisian athletes previously competed in London, including fencing sisters [[Azza Besbes|Azza]] and [[Sarra Besbes]], tennis players [[Malek Jaziri]] and [[Ons Jabeur]], three-time Olympic judoka [[Nihal Chikhrouhou]] (women's +78 kg) and [[Houda Miled]] (women's 70 kg), race walker [[Hassanine Sebei]], and freestyle wrestler [[Marwa Amri]].\n\nTunisia returned home from Rio de Janeiro with three bronze medals; each of them was awarded to the Tunisian athletes in fencing, taekwondo, and wrestling, respectively, for the first time. Moreover, it matched the overall tally achieved in London four years earlier. Among the medalists were Amri (women's 58 kg), three-time Olympic fencer [[In\u00e8s Boubakri]] (women's foil), and taekwondo fighter [[Oussama Oueslati]] (men's 80 kg).<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.lapresse.tn/21082016/118925/du-bronze-pour-oussama-oueslati.html|title=Du bronze pour Oussama Oueslati|trans-title=Bronze for Oussama Oueslati|language=fr|publisher=[[La Presse de Tunisie]]|date=20 August 2016|accessdate=16 October 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161018204950/http://www.lapresse.tn/21082016/118925/du-bronze-pour-oussama-oueslati.html|archivedate=18 October 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref> \n\n==Medalists==\n{{further|2016 Summer Olympics medal table|List of 2016 Summer Olympics medal winners}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\"\n|-\n!

This was the nation's thirteenth appearance at the Olympics, having missed the [[1980 Summer Olympics]] in Moscow because of its partial support for the [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|United States boycott]].\n\nThe [[Tunisian Olympic Committee]] ({{lang-fr|Comit\u00e9 National Olympique Tunisien}}, ''CNOT'') sent the nation's largest delegation to the Games, surpassing the number of athletes sent to [[2008 Summer Olympics|Beijing]] by almost two thirds. A total of 83 athletes, 63 men and 20 women, competed in 17 sports. [[Basketball at the 2012 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's tournament|Men's basketball]], [[Handball at the 2012 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's tournament|men's handball]], and [[Volleyball at the 2012 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's tournament|men's indoor volleyball]] were the only team-based sports in which Tunisia was represented at these Olympic games. There was only a single competitor in artistic gymnastics, sailing, shooting, and taekwondo.\n\nNotable Tunisian athletes included freestyle swimmer and defending champion [[Oussama Mellouli]], who competed at his fourth Olympics, tennis player and former [[2010 Summer Youth Olympics|Youth Olympic]] games participant [[Ons Jabeur]], and fencing sisters [[Azza Besbes|Azza]] and [[Sarra Besbes]]. [[Heykel Megannem]], captain of Tunisia's handball team, made his Olympic comeback in London after a twelve-year absence and was the nation's flag bearer at the opening ceremony.\n\nTunisia left London with three medals, which were all awarded to the team in athletics and swimming. This was the nation's most successful Olympics, winning the largest number of medals in its history, sending its largest delegation ever to the games due to the presence of team-based athletes, and making Olympic history for two legendary athletes. Middle-distance runner [[Habiba Ghribi]] became the first Tunisian female athlete to win an Olympic medal in the women's steeplechase. Meanwhile, Oussama Mellouli became the first Olympic swimming champion at both pool and open water, and became most successful Tunisian athlete in Olympic history with two gold medals.<ref>{{cite news|title=London 2012: Fifth for Daniel Fogg not enough in Olympic 10km swim|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/aug/10/london-2012-oussama-mellouli-open-water|publisher=The Guardian (UK)|date=10 August 2012|accessdate=16 September 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Medalists==\n{{col-begin}}\n| width=\"78%\" align=\"left\" valign=\"top\" |\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\"\n|-\n!

This was the nation's thirteenth appearance at the Olympics, having missed the [[1980 Summer Olympics]] in Moscow because of its partial support for the [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|United States boycott]].\n\nThe [[Tunisian Olympic Committee]] ({{lang-fr|Comit\u00e9 National Olympique Tunisien}}, ''CNOT'') sent the nation's largest delegation to the Games, surpassing the number of athletes sent to [[2008 Summer Olympics|Beijing]] by almost two thirds. A total of 83 athletes, 63 men and 20 women, competed in 17 sports. [[Basketball at the 2012 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's tournament|Men's basketball]], [[Handball at the 2012 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's tournament|men's handball]], and [[Volleyball at the 2012 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's tournament|men's indoor volleyball]] were the only team-based sports in which Tunisia was represented at these Olympic games. There was only a single competitor in artistic gymnastics, sailing, shooting, and taekwondo.\n\nNotable Tunisian athletes included freestyle swimmer and defending champion [[Oussama Mellouli]], who competed at his fourth Olympics, tennis player and former [[2010 Summer Youth Olympics|Youth Olympic]] games participant [[Ons Jabeur]], and fencing sisters [[Azza Besbes|Azza]] and [[Sarra Besbes]]. [[Heykel Megannem]], captain of Tunisia's handball team, made his Olympic comeback in London after a twelve-year absence and was the nation's flag bearer at the opening ceremony.\n\nTunisia left London with three medals, which were all awarded to the team in athletics and swimming. This was the nation's most successful Olympics, winning the largest number of medals in its history, sending its largest delegation ever to the games due to the presence of team-based athletes, and making Olympic history for two legendary athletes. Middle-distance runner [[Habiba Ghribi]] became the first Tunisian female athlete to win an Olympic medal in the women's steeplechase. Meanwhile, Oussama Mellouli became the first Olympic swimming champion at both pool and open water, and became most successful Tunisian athlete in Olympic history with two gold medals.<ref>{{cite news|title=London 2012: Fifth for Daniel Fogg not enough in Olympic 10km swim|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/aug/10/london-2012-oussama-mellouli-open-water|publisher=The Guardian (UK)|date=10 August 2012|accessdate=16 September 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Medalists==\n{{col-begin}}\n| width=\"78%\" align=\"left\" valign=\"top\" |\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\"\n|-\n!

Its main role was the defence of the harbours and shipyards on the [[River Tay]], but it also provided a detachment that saw active service in [[North Russia Intervention|North Russia]] at the end of [[World War I]]. In the 1930s, it was turned into an air defence unit, in which role it served in [[World War II]]. A brief postwar revival ended in disbandment in 1950.\n\n==Precursor unit==\nWhen [[Andrew Clarke (British Army officer, born 1824)|Lieutenant-General Sir Andrew Clarke]], Inspector-General of Fortifications 1882\u20136, did not have enough Regular [[Royal Engineers]] (RE) to man the [[Controlled mines|fixed mines]] being installed to defend British seaports, he utilised the [[Volunteer Force (Great Britain)|Volunteer]] Engineers for this task. After successful trials, the system was rolled out to ports around the country,<ref>Beckett, pp. 184\u20135.</ref><ref>Short ''et al'', pp. 1\u20134.</ref> and a new Volunteer company was raised at [[Dundee]] on 5 February 1887 to cover the [[Firth of Tay]], entitled '''Tay Division Submarine Miners'''. It moved its headquarters to [[Broughty Ferry]] in 1890.<ref name = Westlake>Westlake, p. 10.</ref> For many years, its Honorary Colonel was [[Arthur Kinnaird, 11th Lord Kinnaird|Arthur Fitzgerald, 11th Lord Kinnaird]].<ref>''Army Lists''.</ref><ref>''Burke's''.</ref>\n\nBy 1907, the [[War Office]] had decided to hand all submarine mining duties over to [[Militia (United Kingdom)|Militia]] units and the Volunteer submarine miners were disbanded. Although most of the units were converted into fortress engineers, this did not happen in the case of the Tay Division, which was disbanded with effect from 2 November.<ref name = Westlake/><ref>''Quarterly Army List'', October 1907.</ref>\n\n==Territorial Force==\nThus, when the Volunteers were subsumed into the new [[Territorial Force]] (TF) under the [[Haldane Reforms]] in 1908, a completely new unit of fortress engineers had to be raised for the Firth of Tay defences. It was entitled the '''City of Dundee (Fortress) Royal Engineers''', with its HQ at 52 Taylors Lane, Dundee, and consisted of a single Works Company.<ref>''Monthly Army List'', August 1914.</ref><ref>[http://scotlandsurbanpast.org.uk/site/331465/dundee-50-2-taylors-lane-drill-hall 52 Taylor's Lane at Scotland's Urban Past.]</ref><ref>Watson & Rinaldi, p. 12.</ref>\n\n==World War I==\nOn the outbreak of [[World War I]], the fortress engineers were mobilised and moved into their war stations in the coastal defences.<ref>Conrad.</ref> In August 1914, TF units were authorised to establish 2nd Line duplicate units to absorb the rush of volunteers coming forward.<ref>Becke, p. 6.</ref> The City of Dundee unit thus formed the '''1/1st Dundee Fortress Company, RE,''' and '''2/1st Dundee Fortress Company, RE'''.<ref name = W&R62>Watson & Rinaldi, pp. 62\u20133, 69, 83.</ref>\n\n===1/1st City of Dundee Army Troops Company===\nOnce it was clear that the threat to Britain's coastal defences was small, six of the fortress engineer units organised their 1st Line as 'Army Troops' companies for service on the [[Line of communications|Lines of Communication]] of the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|British Expeditionary Force]]. The 1/1st City of Dundee Fortress Company embarked for France on 6 May 1915 and after arriving at [[Abbeville]] was assigned to [[Second Army (United Kingdom)|Second Army]] the following month. In February 1917 it was redesignated '''554th (Dundee) Army Troops Company, RE'''. It remained serving with Second Army after the [[Armistice with Germany]] until at least June 1919.<ref name = W&R62/><ref>'Embarkation Dates', [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|The National Archives (TNA), Kew]] file WO 162/7.</ref><ref>Morling, p. 38.</ref>\n\n===2/1st City of Dundee Army Troops Company===\nInitially, the 2nd Line were intended as reserve units to allow the 1st Line to go on service, but  in November 1916 the 2/1st Dundee Company was redesignated as a Field Company, RE, and assigned to [[71st Division (United Kingdom)|71st Division]]. When the TF engineers were numbered in February 1917, the company became '''548th (Dundee) Field Company, RE'''.<ref name = W&R62/><ref name = Becke>Becke, pp. 101\u20135.</ref>\n\n71st Division was a home service formation, responsible for defending the coast of [[Essex]] from [[Mersea Island]] to [[Walton-on-the-Naze]]. Later, it became a training division, which was broken up in March 1918. One of its infantry brigades ([[214th Brigade (United Kingdom)|214th Brigade]]) had been converted into a Special Service Brigade with attached troops and was earmarked to join the [[Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War#Northern Russia|North Russia Expeditionary Force]]. In the event, 214th Brigade remained in the UK, but 548th (Dundee) Field Company, redesignated as an 'Army Troops Company', did proceed to [[Murmansk]]. The advance party landed on 20 June 1918, and was followed by the main body three days later.<ref name = W&R62/><ref name = Becke/>\n\nThe force at Murmansk defended the ice-free port facilities and the [[Kirov Railway|Murmansk\u2013Petrograd]] railway as far as [[Kem, Russia|Kem]] on the [[White Sea]], against the threat of attacks by German and Finnish [[White Guard (Finland)|White Guard]] forces in the closing months of World War I. It continued this duty during the complex postwar political and military exchanges with local [[Bolsheviks]] and Finnish [[Red Guards (Finland)|Red Guards]]. It was finally withdrawn in 1920.<ref>Lincoln, pp. 176\u201382, 268\u201373, 278\u20139.</ref>\n\n==Interwar==\nWhen the TF was reconstituted as the [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]] (TA) in 1920, the City of Dundee Fortress Engineers reformed at the Drill Hall in Bell Street, Dundee.

Its main role was the defence of the harbours and shipyards on the [[River Tay]], but it also provided a detachment that saw active service in [[North Russia Intervention|North Russia]] at the end of [[World War I]]. In the 1930s, it was turned into an air defence unit, in which role it served in [[World War II]]. A brief postwar revival ended in disbandment in 1950.\n\n==Precursor unit==\nWhen [[Andrew Clarke (British Army officer)|Lieutenant-General Sir Andrew Clarke]], Inspector-General of Fortifications 1882\u20136, did not have enough Regular [[Royal Engineers]] (RE) to man the [[Controlled mines|fixed mines]] being installed to defend British seaports, he utilised the [[Volunteer Force (Great Britain)|Volunteer]] Engineers for this task. After successful trials, the system was rolled out to ports around the country,<ref>Beckett, pp. 184\u20135.</ref><ref>Short ''et al'', pp. 1\u20134.</ref> and a new Volunteer company was raised at [[Dundee]] on 5 February 1887 to cover the [[Firth of Tay]], entitled '''Tay Division Submarine Miners'''. It moved its headquarters to [[Broughty Ferry]] in 1890.<ref name = Westlake>Westlake, p. 10.</ref> For many years, its Honorary Colonel was [[Arthur Kinnaird, 11th Lord Kinnaird|Arthur Fitzgerald, 11th Lord Kinnaird]].<ref>''Army Lists''.</ref><ref>''Burke's''.</ref>\n\nBy 1907, the [[War Office]] had decided to hand all submarine mining duties over to [[Militia (United Kingdom)|Militia]] units and the Volunteer submarine miners were disbanded. Although most of the units were converted into fortress engineers, this did not happen in the case of the Tay Division, which was disbanded with effect from 2 November.<ref name = Westlake/><ref>''Quarterly Army List'', October 1907.</ref>\n\n==Territorial Force==\nThus, when the Volunteers were subsumed into the new [[Territorial Force]] (TF) under the [[Haldane Reforms]] in 1908, a completely new unit of fortress engineers had to be raised for the Firth of Tay defences. It was entitled the '''City of Dundee (Fortress) Royal Engineers''', with its HQ at 52 Taylors Lane, Dundee, and consisted of a single Works Company.<ref>''Monthly Army List'', August 1914.</ref><ref>[http://scotlandsurbanpast.org.uk/site/331465/dundee-50-2-taylors-lane-drill-hall 52 Taylor's Lane at Scotland's Urban Past.]</ref><ref>Watson & Rinaldi, p. 12.</ref>\n\n==World War I==\nOn the outbreak of [[World War I]], the fortress engineers were mobilised and moved into their war stations in the coastal defences.<ref>Conrad.</ref> In August 1914, TF units were authorised to establish 2nd Line duplicate units to absorb the rush of volunteers coming forward.<ref>Becke, p. 6.</ref> The City of Dundee unit thus formed the '''1/1st Dundee Fortress Company, RE,''' and '''2/1st Dundee Fortress Company, RE'''.<ref name = W&R62>Watson & Rinaldi, pp. 62\u20133, 69, 83.</ref>\n\n===1/1st City of Dundee Army Troops Company===\nOnce it was clear that the threat to Britain's coastal defences was small, six of the fortress engineer units organised their 1st Line as 'Army Troops' companies for service on the [[Line of communications|Lines of Communication]] of the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|British Expeditionary Force]]. The 1/1st City of Dundee Fortress Company embarked for France on 6 May 1915 and after arriving at [[Abbeville]] was assigned to [[Second Army (United Kingdom)|Second Army]] the following month. In February 1917 it was redesignated '''554th (Dundee) Army Troops Company, RE'''. It remained serving with Second Army after the [[Armistice with Germany]] until at least June 1919.<ref name = W&R62/><ref>'Embarkation Dates', [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|The National Archives (TNA), Kew]] file WO 162/7.</ref><ref>Morling, p. 38.</ref>\n\n===2/1st City of Dundee Army Troops Company===\nInitially, the 2nd Line were intended as reserve units to allow the 1st Line to go on service, but  in November 1916 the 2/1st Dundee Company was redesignated as a Field Company, RE, and assigned to [[71st Division (United Kingdom)|71st Division]]. When the TF engineers were numbered in February 1917, the company became '''548th (Dundee) Field Company, RE'''.<ref name = W&R62/><ref name = Becke>Becke, pp. 101\u20135.</ref>\n\n71st Division was a home service formation, responsible for defending the coast of [[Essex]] from [[Mersea Island]] to [[Walton-on-the-Naze]]. Later, it became a training division, which was broken up in March 1918. One of its infantry brigades ([[214th Brigade (United Kingdom)|214th Brigade]]) had been converted into a Special Service Brigade with attached troops and was earmarked to join the [[Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War#Northern Russia|North Russia Expeditionary Force]]. In the event, 214th Brigade remained in the UK, but 548th (Dundee) Field Company, redesignated as an 'Army Troops Company', did proceed to [[Murmansk]]. The advance party landed on 20 June 1918, and was followed by the main body three days later.<ref name = W&R62/><ref name = Becke/>\n\nThe force at Murmansk defended the ice-free port facilities and the [[Kirov Railway|Murmansk\u2013Petrograd]] railway as far as [[Kem, Russia|Kem]] on the [[White Sea]], against the threat of attacks by German and Finnish [[White Guard (Finland)|White Guard]] forces in the closing months of World War I. It continued this duty during the complex postwar political and military exchanges with local [[Bolsheviks]] and Finnish [[Red Guards (Finland)|Red Guards]]. It was finally withdrawn in 1920.<ref>Lincoln, pp. 176\u201382, 268\u201373, 278\u20139.</ref>\n\n==Interwar==\nWhen the TF was reconstituted as the [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]] (TA) in 1920, the City of Dundee Fortress Engineers reformed at the Drill Hall in Bell Street, Dundee.

It was established as a separate arm of the [[Norwegian Armed Forces]] on 10 November 1944. The RNoAF's peacetime establishment is approximately 2,430 employees (officers, enlisted staff and civilians). 600 personnel also serve their draft period in the RNoAF. After [[mobilization]] the RNoAF would consist of approximately 5,500 personnel.\n\nThe infrastructure of the RNoAF includes six [[airbase]]s (at [[\u00d8rland Main Air Station|\u00d8rland]], [[Rygge Air Station|Rygge]], [[And\u00f8ya Air Station|And\u00f8ya]], [[Bardufoss Air Station|Bardufoss]], [[Bod\u00f8 Main Air Station|Bod\u00f8]] and [[Gardermoen Air Station|Gardermoen]]), one control and reporting centre (at [[S\u00f8rreisa]]) and two training centres at {{ill|Persaunet|no}} in [[Trondheim]] and at KNM Harald Haarfagre/[[Hafrsfjord|Madlaleiren]] in [[Stavanger]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Conception===\nMilitary flights started on 1 June 1912. The first plane, [[HNoMS Start|HNoMS ''Start'']], was bought with money donated by the public and piloted by [[Hans Dons]], second in command of Norway's first [[submarine]] HNoMS ''Kobben'' (A-1).<ref>Official Norwegian Defence Force website: [http://www.mil.no/luft/start/omlf/historikk/ History of the Royal Norwegian Air Force] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060507100725/http://www.mil.no/luft/start/omlf/historikk/ |date=2006-05-07 }} {{in lang|no}}</ref> Until 1940 most of the aircraft belonging to the Navy and Army air forces were domestic designs or built under license agreements, the main bomber/scout aircraft of the Army air force being the Dutch-origined [[Fokker C.V]].\n{{Norwegian defence}}\n\n===World War II===\n\n====Build-up for World War II====\n[[File:Norwegian Army Air Service Gloster Gladiator 423.jpg|thumb|left|[[Gloster Gladiator]] 423 in 1938\u20131940]]\nBefore 1944 the Air Force were divided into the [[Norwegian Army Air Service]]  (H\u00e6rens Flyvevaaben) and the [[Royal Norwegian Navy Air Service]] (Marinens Flyvevaaben).\n\nIn the late 1930s, as war seemed imminent, more modern aircraft was bought from abroad, including twelve [[Gloster Gladiator]] fighters from the UK, and six [[Heinkel He 115]]s from [[Nazi Germany|Germany]]. Considerable orders for aircraft were placed with United States companies during the months prior to the invasion of Norway on 9 April 1940.\n\nThe most important of the US orders were two orders for comparatively modern [[P-36 Hawk|Curtiss P-36 Hawk]] [[monoplane]] fighters. The first was for 24 Hawk 75A-6 (with 1200 [[Horsepower|hp]] [[Pratt & Whitney]] [[Pratt & Whitney R-1830 Twin Wasp|R-1830-SC3-G Twin Wasp]] engines), 19 of which were delivered before the invasion. Of these 19, though, none were operational when the attack came. A number were still in their shipping crates in Oslo harbour, while others stood at the [[Kjeller]] aircraft factory, flight ready, but none combat ready. Some of the Kjeller aircraft had not been fitted with machine guns, and those that had been fitted still lacked [[gun sight]]s.\n\nThe ship with the last five 75A-6s that were bound for Norway was diverted to the United Kingdom, where they were taken over by [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF). All 19 Norwegian P-36s that were captured by the German invaders were later sold by the German authorities to the [[Finnish Air Force#Continuation War|Finnish Air Force]], which was to use them to good effect during the [[Continuation War]].\n\nThe other order for P-36s was for 36 Hawk 75A-8 (with 1200&nbsp;hp [[Wright R-1820]]-95 Cyclone 9 engines), none of which were delivered in time for the invasion, but were delivered to  \"[[Little Norway]]\" near Toronto, Ontario, Canada. There they were used for training Norwegian pilots until the [[USAAF]] took over the aircraft and used them under the designation P36G.\n\nAlso ordered prior to the invasion were 24 [[Northrop N-3PB]] [[float plane]]s built in on Norwegian specifications for a [[patrol bomber]]. The order was made on 12 March 1940 in an effort to replace the Royal Norwegian Navy Air Service's obsolete MF.11 biplane patrol aircraft. None of the type were delivered by 9 April and when they became operational with the [[No. 330 Squadron RAF|330 (Norwegian) Squadron]] in May 1941 they were stationed at [[Reykjav\u00edk]], [[Iceland]] performing [[anti-submarine]] and [[convoy]] escort duties.\n\n[[File:Norwegian Army Air Service WW2.svg|100px|thumb|1937\u20131940 aircraft marking]]\n\n====Escape and exile====\nThe unequal situation led to the rapid defeat of the Norwegian air forces, even though seven Gladiators from ''Jagevingen'' (the fighter wing) defended [[Oslo Airport, Fornebu|Fornebu airport]] against the attacking German forces with some success\u2014claiming two [[Messerschmitt Bf 110|Bf 110]] heavy fighters, two [[Heinkel He 111|He 111]] bombers and one [[Junkers Ju 52]] transport. ''Jagevingen'' lost two Gladiators to ground [[strafing]] while they were rearming on Fornebu and one in the air, shot down by Future ''Experte'' [[Helmut Lent]], injuring the sergeant pilot. After the withdrawal of allied forces, the Norwegian Government ceased fighting in Norway and evacuated to the [[United Kingdom]] on 10 June 1940.\n\n[[File:Tiger Moth Blue.jpg|thumb|left|[[de Havilland Tiger Moth|DH.82A Tiger Moth]] in Royal Norwegian Air Force markings]]\n\nOnly aircraft of the Royal Norwegian Navy Air Service had the range to fly all the way from their last remaining bases in [[Northern Norway]] to the UK. Included amongst the Norwegian aircraft that reached the British Isles were four German-made Heinkel He 115 seaplane bombers, six of which were bought before the war and two more were captured from the Germans during the [[Norwegian Campaign]]. One He 115 also escaped to Finland before the surrender of mainland Norway, as did three [[Marinens Flyvebaatfabrikk M.F.11|M.F. 11]]s; landing on Lake Salmij\u00e4rvi in [[Pechengsky District|Petsamo]]. A captured [[Arado Ar 196]] originating from the German [[heavy cruiser]] ''[[German cruiser Admiral Hipper|Admiral Hipper]]'' was also flown to Britain for testing.\n\nFor the Norwegian Army Air Service aircraft the only option for escape was Finland, where the planes would be interned but at least not fall into the hands of the Germans. In all two Fokker C.V.s and one [[de Havilland Tiger Moth]] made it across the border and onto Finnish airfields just before the capitulation of mainland Norway. All navy and army aircraft that fled to Finland were pressed into service with the [[Finnish Air Force]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sci.fi/~ambush/faf/fafincolor.html|title=Finnish Air Force Aircraft of WWII|publisher=|accessdate=4 November 2017|df=}}{{dead link|date=July 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> while most of the aircrew eventually ended up in \"Little Norway\".\n\nThe Army and Navy air services established themselves in Britain under the command of the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]]. Norwegian air and ground crews operated as part of the British [[Royal Air Force]], in both wholly Norwegian squadrons and also in other squadrons and units such as [[RAF Ferry Command]] and [[RAF Bomber Command]]. In particular, Norwegian personnel operated two squadrons of [[Supermarine Spitfire]]s: RAF 132 (Norwegian) Wing consisted of [[No. 331 Squadron RAF|No. 331 (Norwegian) Squadron]] and [[No. 332 Squadron RAF|RAF No. 332 (Norwegian) Squadron]]. Both planes and running costs were financed by the exiled Norwegian government.\n\nIn the autumn of 1940, a Norwegian training centre known as \"Little Norway\" was established next to [[Billy Bishop Toronto City Airport|Toronto Island Airport]], Canada.\n\nThe Royal Norwegian Air Force (RNoAF) was established by a [[royal decree]] on 1 November 1944, thereby merging the Army and Navy air forces. No. 331 (Norwegian) Squadron defended London from 1941 and was the highest scoring fighter [[squadron (aviation)|squadron]] in [[South England]] during the war.\n\nUp until 8 May 1945, 335 persons had lost their lives while taking part in the efforts of the RNoAF.\n\n===Post-war air force===\n[[File:Norwegian Air Force Spitefire.jpg|thumb|Royal Norwegian Air Force Spitfire]]\nAfter the war the Spitfire remained in service with the RNoAF into the fifties.\n\nIn 1947, the Surveillance and Control Division acquired its first radar system, and around the same time the RNoAF got its first [[jet fighter]]s in the form of [[de Havilland Vampire]]s.\n\nIn 1949 Norway co-founded [[NATO]], and soon afterwards received American aircraft through the MAP (Military Aid Program). The expansion of the Air Force happened at a very rapid pace as the [[Cold War]] progressed. Throughout the Cold War the Norwegian Air Force was only one of two NATO air forces\u2014[[Turkey]] being the other\u2014with a responsibility for an area with a land border with the [[Soviet Union]], and Norwegian fighter aircraft had on average 500\u2013600 interceptions of Soviet aircraft each year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oslomilsamfund.no/foredrag/2004/2004-11-08-Nodeland.html|title=The Norwegian Air Force chief's address to Oslo Military Society in 2004|accessdate=4 November 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927005518/http://www.oslomilsamfund.no/foredrag/2004/2004-11-08-Nodeland.html|archivedate=27 September 2007}}</ref>\n\nIn 1959, the [[Anti-aircraft warfare|Anti-Aircraft Artillery]] was integrated into the Royal Norwegian Air Force.\n\nIn 1999, Norway participated with a number of F-16s during operation 'Allied Force'.<ref>[[NATO bombing of Yugoslavia]]</ref>\n\n==21st century RNoAF==\nIn October 2002, a tri-national force of 18 Norwegian, [[Royal Danish Air Force|Danish]], and [[Royal Netherlands Air Force|Dutch]] F-16 fighter-bombers, with one Dutch Air Force [[KC-10]]A [[Tanker (aircraft)|tanker]], flew to the [[Manas Air Base]] in [[Kyrgyzstan]], to support the NATO ground forces in [[Afghanistan]] as a part of the [[Operation Enduring Freedom]].

It was established as a separate arm of the [[Norwegian Armed Forces]] on 10 November 1944. The RNoAF's peacetime establishment is approximately 2,430 employees (officers, enlisted staff and civilians). 600 personnel also serve their draft period in the RNoAF. After [[mobilization]] the RNoAF would consist of approximately 5,500 personnel.\n\nThe infrastructure of the RNoAF includes six [[airbase]]s (at [[\u00d8rland Main Air Station|\u00d8rland]], [[Rygge Air Station|Rygge]], [[And\u00f8ya Air Station|And\u00f8ya]], [[Bardufoss Air Station|Bardufoss]], [[Bod\u00f8 Main Air Station|Bod\u00f8]] and [[Gardermoen Air Station|Gardermoen]]), one control and reporting centre (at [[S\u00f8rreisa]]) and two training centres at {{ill|Persaunet|no}} in [[Trondheim]] and at KNM Harald Haarfagre/[[Hafrsfjord|Madlaleiren]] in [[Stavanger]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Conception===\nMilitary flights started on 1 June 1912. The first plane, [[HNoMS Start|HNoMS ''Start'']], was bought with money donated by the public and piloted by [[Hans Dons]], second in command of Norway's first [[submarine]] HNoMS ''Kobben'' (A-1).<ref>Official Norwegian Defence Force website: [http://www.mil.no/luft/start/omlf/historikk/ History of the Royal Norwegian Air Force] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060507100725/http://www.mil.no/luft/start/omlf/historikk/ |date=2006-05-07 }} {{in lang|no}}</ref> Until 1940 most of the aircraft belonging to the Navy and Army air forces were domestic designs or built under license agreements, the main bomber/scout aircraft of the Army air force being the Dutch-origined [[Fokker C.V]].\n{{Norwegian defence}}\n\n===World War II===\n\n====Build-up for World War II====\n[[File:Norwegian Army Air Service Gloster Gladiator 423.jpg|thumb|left|[[Gloster Gladiator]] 423 in 1938\u20131940]]\nBefore 1944 the Air Force were divided into the [[Norwegian Army Air Service]]  (H\u00e6rens Flyvevaaben) and the [[Royal Norwegian Navy Air Service]] (Marinens Flyvevaaben).\n\nIn the late 1930s, as war seemed imminent, more modern aircraft was bought from abroad, including twelve [[Gloster Gladiator]] fighters from the UK, and six [[Heinkel He 115]]s from [[Nazi Germany|Germany]]. Considerable orders for aircraft were placed with United States companies during the months prior to the invasion of Norway on 9 April 1940.\n\nThe most important of the US orders were two orders for comparatively modern [[P-36 Hawk|Curtiss P-36 Hawk]] [[monoplane]] fighters. The first was for 24 Hawk 75A-6 (with 1200 [[Horsepower|hp]] [[Pratt & Whitney]] [[Pratt & Whitney R-1830 Twin Wasp|R-1830-SC3-G Twin Wasp]] engines), 19 of which were delivered before the invasion. Of these 19, though, none were operational when the attack came. A number were still in their shipping crates in Oslo harbour, while others stood at the [[Kjeller]] aircraft factory, flight ready, but none combat ready. Some of the Kjeller aircraft had not been fitted with machine guns, and those that had been fitted still lacked [[gun sight]]s.\n\nThe ship with the last five 75A-6s that were bound for Norway was diverted to the United Kingdom, where they were taken over by [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF). All 19 Norwegian P-36s that were captured by the German invaders were later sold by the German authorities to the [[Finnish Air Force#Continuation War|Finnish Air Force]], which was to use them to good effect during the [[Continuation War]].\n\nThe other order for P-36s was for 36 Hawk 75A-8 (with 1200&nbsp;hp [[Wright R-1820]]-95 Cyclone 9 engines), none of which were delivered in time for the invasion, but were delivered to  \"[[Little Norway]]\" near Toronto, Ontario, Canada. There they were used for training Norwegian pilots until the [[USAAF]] took over the aircraft and used them under the designation P36G.\n\nAlso ordered prior to the invasion were 24 [[Northrop N-3PB]] [[float plane]]s built in on Norwegian specifications for a [[patrol bomber]]. The order was made on 12 March 1940 in an effort to replace the Royal Norwegian Navy Air Service's obsolete MF.11 biplane patrol aircraft. None of the type were delivered by 9 April and when they became operational with the [[No. 330 Squadron RAF|330 (Norwegian) Squadron]] in May 1941 they were stationed at [[Reykjav\u00edk]], [[Iceland]] performing [[anti-submarine]] and [[convoy]] escort duties.\n\n[[File:Norwegian Army Air Service WW2.svg|100px|thumb|1937\u20131940 aircraft marking]]\n\n====Escape and exile====\nThe unequal situation led to the rapid defeat of the Norwegian air forces, even though seven Gladiators from ''Jagevingen'' (the fighter wing) defended [[Oslo Airport, Fornebu|Fornebu airport]] against the attacking German forces with some success\u2014claiming two [[Messerschmitt Bf 110|Bf 110]] heavy fighters, two [[Heinkel He 111|He 111]] bombers and one [[Junkers Ju 52]] transport. ''Jagevingen'' lost two Gladiators to ground [[strafing]] while they were rearming on Fornebu and one in the air, shot down by Future ''Experte'' [[Helmut Lent]], injuring the sergeant pilot. After the withdrawal of allied forces, the Norwegian Government ceased fighting in Norway and evacuated to the [[United Kingdom]] on 10 June 1940.\n\n[[File:Tiger Moth Blue.jpg|thumb|left|[[de Havilland Tiger Moth|DH.82A Tiger Moth]] in Royal Norwegian Air Force markings]]\n\nOnly aircraft of the Royal Norwegian Navy Air Service had the range to fly all the way from their last remaining bases in [[Northern Norway]] to the UK. Included amongst the Norwegian aircraft that reached the British Isles were four German-made Heinkel He 115 seaplane bombers, six of which were bought before the war and two more were captured from the Germans during the [[Norwegian Campaign]]. One He 115 also escaped to Finland before the surrender of mainland Norway, as did three [[Marinens Flyvebaatfabrikk M.F.11|M.F. 11]]s; landing on Lake Salmij\u00e4rvi in [[Pechengsky District|Petsamo]]. A captured [[Arado Ar 196]] originating from the German [[heavy cruiser]] ''[[German cruiser Admiral Hipper|Admiral Hipper]]'' was also flown to Britain for testing.\n\nFor the Norwegian Army Air Service aircraft the only option for escape was Finland, where the planes would be interned but at least not fall into the hands of the Germans. In all two Fokker C.V.s and one [[de Havilland Tiger Moth]] made it across the border and onto Finnish airfields just before the capitulation of mainland Norway. All navy and army aircraft that fled to Finland were pressed into service with the [[Finnish Air Force]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sci.fi/~ambush/faf/fafincolor.html|title=Finnish Air Force Aircraft of WWII|publisher=|accessdate=4 November 2017|df=}}{{dead link|date=July 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> while most of the aircrew eventually ended up in \"Little Norway\".\n\nThe Army and Navy air services established themselves in Britain under the command of the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]]. Norwegian air and ground crews operated as part of the British [[Royal Air Force]], in both wholly Norwegian squadrons and also in other squadrons and units such as [[RAF Ferry Command]] and [[RAF Bomber Command]]. In particular, Norwegian personnel operated two squadrons of [[Supermarine Spitfire]]s: RAF 132 (Norwegian) Wing consisted of [[No. 331 Squadron RAF|No. 331 (Norwegian) Squadron]] and [[No. 332 Squadron RAF|RAF No. 332 (Norwegian) Squadron]]. Both planes and running costs were financed by the exiled Norwegian government.\n\nIn the autumn of 1940, a Norwegian training centre known as \"Little Norway\" was established next to [[Billy Bishop Toronto City Airport|Toronto Island Airport]], Canada.\n\nThe Royal Norwegian Air Force (RNoAF) was established by a [[royal decree]] on 1 November 1944, thereby merging the Army and Navy air forces. No. 331 (Norwegian) Squadron defended London from 1941 and was the highest scoring fighter [[squadron (aviation)|squadron]] in [[South England]] during the war.\n\nUp until 8 May 1945, 335 persons had lost their lives while taking part in the efforts of the RNoAF.\n\n===Post-war air force===\n[[File:Norwegian Air Force Spitefire.jpg|thumb|Royal Norwegian Air Force Spitfire]]\nAfter the war the Spitfire remained in service with the RNoAF into the fifties.\n\nIn 1947, the Surveillance and Control Division acquired its first radar system, and around the same time the RNoAF got its first [[jet fighter]]s in the form of [[de Havilland Vampire]]s.\n\nIn 1949 Norway co-founded [[NATO]], and soon afterwards received American aircraft through the MAP (Military Aid Program). The expansion of the Air Force happened at a very rapid pace as the [[Cold War]] progressed.
