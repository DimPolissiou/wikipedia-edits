The plot revolves around Billy Brown (Gallo), a man who kidnaps a young tapdancer (Ricci) and forces her to pretend to be his wife to impress his parents (Gazzara and Huston) after he gets released from prison.\n\nThe film was generally well-received; ''[[Empire Magazine|Empire]]'' listed it as the 36th-greatest [[independent film]] ever made.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmsite.org/independentfilms.html |title=50 Greatest Independent Films From Empire |publisher=Filmsite.org |date= |accessdate=2010-10-19}}</ref> It was filmed in and around Gallo's hometown of [[Buffalo, New York]], in winter.\n\nThe title refers to the [[Buffalo Bills]] [[American football]] team, who had not won a championship since the [[1965 American Football League Championship Game]] (which was actually played on December 28, 1965, four days before 1966 began).<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1duitd-N1Us&t=35 Buffalo '66 (trailer)]</ref> The plot involves indirect references to the Bills' narrow loss to the [[New York Giants]] in [[Super Bowl XXV]], which was decided by a missed [[field goal]].\n\n==Plot==\nHaving just served five years in prison for a crime he did not commit, Billy Brown is forced to meet with his parents, who were unaware about him being in prison. He kidnaps Layla, a tap dancer, and forces her to pretend to be his wife to his parents.\n\nWhen they meet with Billy's parents, Layla sees that the relationship between them is very dysfunctional, and sees Billy's own mother forgetting he has a chocolate allergy and his father miming along to a song after claiming he used to be a singer. She finds out that Billy's mother has never missed a Buffalo game, except for in 1966, on the day which Billy was born.\n\nAfter visiting his parents, Billy scolds Layla for telling an obvious lie to his father about him working with the CIA and decides to go bowling. Here Billy shows off his expertise at the sport, and Layla gives a bizarre [[tap dance]] routine to [[King Crimson]]'s 'Moonchild'. The two use a photo booth, but Billy becomes annoyed when Layla seems to enjoy making silly faces during the photos, in contrast to Billy's straight face.\n\nAfter bowling, Billy and Layla visit a diner, where Billy encounters Wendy, a girl he used to have a crush on back in his school days. Earlier he had asked Layla to pretend to be Wendy to his parents, who is now happily in a relationship with another man. This annoys Billy leading to him and Layla checking into a motel, where Billy and Layla have a deep conversation, and eventually admit that they have fallen in love with each other, and they both go to sleep.\n\nIt's revealed that Billy was in prison because he was unable to pay the money that he had placed a bet on Buffalo winning the Super Bowl, and now he seeks revenge on the man who lost the game. In the morning, he begins to leave to exact his revenge when Layla awakens. Despite Layla's doubts that he'll return and proclamation of her love for him, he leaves, lying to her that he'll return in a few minutes with hot chocolate for her.\n\nShortly after leaving Layla at the motel, Billy finds the man responsible, Scott Wood (a reference to a former [[Buffalo Bills]] kicker, [[Scott Norwood]], who missed the potential [[Wide Right (Buffalo Bills)|game-winning field goal]] in [[Super Bowl XXV]] against the [[New York Giants]] in 1991.<ref>[http://sport.guardian.co.uk/americansports/osm/story/0,,1982103,00.html \"It's Super Bowl loser borwood's unlucky number.

However, this is all shown to be inside of Billy's mind, as he decides to not kill Wood, realizing he's finally found a person who truly loves him.

He had three notable half-brothers: [[Sir Henry Martin, 1st Baronet]] (1733\u20131794), for many years naval commissioner at Portsmouth and [[Third Sea Lord|Comptroller of the Navy]], and the father of [[Thomas Byam Martin]]; [[Josiah Martin]] (1737\u20131786), [[Governor of North Carolina]] from 1771 and [[William Byam Martin]], a merchant and official of the [[East India Company]] who returned to England as wealthy [[nabob]].<ref name=\"Jeppesen\">{{cite web |last1=Jeppesen |first1=Chris |title=Atlantic and Indian Ocean Worlds: Uncovering connections between the East India Company and the British Caribbean colonies through the British Library\u2019s Collections |url=https://cpb-eu-w2.wpmucdn.com/blogs.ucl.ac.uk/dist/1/251/files/2013/01/East-meets-West-Finding-Aid-Final-21.08.14.pdf |accessdate=12 September 2019}}</ref> His full-sister Henrietta (Rilla) Fitzgerald was the mother of poet [[William Thomas Fitzgerald]] and mother-in-law of equity lawyer [[John Anthony Fonblanque|John Fonblanque KC MP]] for Camelford 1802\u20131806. Martin's will seems to reveal the existence of the mother of his natural child or children.\n\n==Parliament==\nMartin sat as [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) for the Cornish borough of [[Camelford (UK Parliament constituency)|Camelford]] from 1747 until 1768. He was a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of an important British politician, [[Henry Bilson Legge]], who was three times [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]]. When Legge was first made Chancellor, Martin served as his secretary from April 1754 until November 1755.\n\nMartin, although he lacked major political talents and was mistrusted by [[Thomas Pelham-Holles, 1st Duke of Newcastle]], had a capacity for hard work and dealing with administration. This led to his being appointed [[Secretary to the Treasury]] for the first time in November 1756, during Legge's second Chancellorship. This was a post which was more administrative than political in nature, although Martin was an MP and the appointment was a patronage one. In April 1757 he left office together with his political allies, led by [[William Pitt the Elder]].\n\nWhen Legge was restored to the Chancellorship for the third time in July 1757, Martin was the only person who had gone out of office in April who was not given a new job in the [[Pitt-Newcastle Coalition]]. Having failed to obtain an office in the King's service, Martin was compensated by being appointed Treasurer to the Princess Dowager of Wales [[Augusta of Saxe-Gotha]] (mother of the future King [[George III of the United Kingdom]]) in October 1757, an office he retained until 8 February 1772. In 1760 King George III succeeded to the throne and Martin was able in the following year to transfer his political loyalty from Legge (who was becoming less prominent in public life) to the King's [[favourite]] [[John Stuart, 3rd Earl of Bute]].\n\nIn April 1758 Martin became [[Secretary to the Treasury]] for the second time and continued in that office until April 1763.

He had three notable half-brothers: [[Sir Henry Martin, 1st Baronet]] (1733\u20131794), for many years naval commissioner at Portsmouth and [[Third Sea Lord|Comptroller of the Navy]], and the father of [[Thomas Byam Martin]]; [[Josiah Martin]] (1737\u20131786), [[Governor of North Carolina]] from 1771 and [[William Byam Martin]], a merchant and official of the [[East India Company]] who returned to England as wealthy [[nabob]].<ref name=\"Jeppesen\">{{cite web |last1=Jeppesen |first1=Chris |title=Atlantic and Indian Ocean Worlds: Uncovering connections between the East India Company and the British Caribbean colonies through the British Library\u2019s Collections |url=https://cpb-eu-w2.wpmucdn.com/blogs.ucl.ac.uk/dist/1/251/files/2013/01/East-meets-West-Finding-Aid-Final-21.08.14.pdf |accessdate=12 September 2019}}</ref> His full-sister Henrietta (Rilla) Fitzgerald was the mother of poet [[William Thomas Fitzgerald]] and mother-in-law of equity lawyer [[John Anthony Fonblanque|John Fonblanque KC MP]] for Camelford 1802-1806. Martin's will seems to reveal the existence of the mother of his natural child or children.\n\n==Parliament==\nMartin sat as [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) for the Cornish borough of [[Camelford (UK Parliament constituency)|Camelford]] from 1747 until 1768. He was a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of an important British politician, [[Henry Bilson Legge]], who was three times [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]]. When Legge was first made Chancellor, Martin served as his secretary from April 1754 until November 1755.\n\nMartin, although he lacked major political talents and was mistrusted by [[Thomas Pelham-Holles, 1st Duke of Newcastle]], had a capacity for hard work and dealing with administration. This led to his being appointed [[Secretary to the Treasury]] for the first time in November 1756, during Legge's second Chancellorship. This was a post which was more administrative than political in nature, although Martin was an MP and the appointment was a patronage one. In April 1757 he left office together with his political allies, led by [[William Pitt the Elder]].\n\nWhen Legge was restored to the Chancellorship for the third time in July 1757, Martin was the only person who had gone out of office in April who was not given a new job in the [[Pitt-Newcastle Coalition]]. Having failed to obtain an office in the King's service, Martin was compensated by being appointed Treasurer to the Princess Dowager of Wales [[Augusta of Saxe-Gotha]] (mother of the future King [[George III of the United Kingdom]]) in October 1757, an office he retained until 8 February 1772. In 1760 King George III succeeded to the throne and Martin was able in the following year to transfer his political loyalty from Legge (who was becoming less prominent in public life) to the King's [[favourite]] [[John Stuart, 3rd Earl of Bute]].\n\nIn April 1758 Martin became [[Secretary to the Treasury]] for the second time and continued in that office until April 1763. After leaving the Treasury in 1763, Martin largely withdrew from public life. He declined to seek re-election to Parliament in 1768, unless the government paid all his election expenses. Although this proposal was not accepted, he was returned again for [[Hastings (UK Parliament constituency)|Hastings]] until 1774.\n\n==Duel with John Wilkes==\n[[File:William Hogarth - John Wilkes, Esq.png|thumb|159px|Satirical engraving of Wilkes by William Hogarth]]\nThe Times of Wednesday 26 November 1788 reported: <blockquote> \"Last week died Samuel Martin Esq<ref>British Museum [https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/search_the_collection_database/search_object_details.aspx?objectId=3083374&partId=1 Britannia attacked by a rat, Martin shoots a mouse]</ref>\n a gentleman well known in the political world and particularly from his having fought a duel about five and twenty years ago with Mr Wilkes\". </blockquote> \nThis pistol duel took place in Hyde Park on 16 November 1763.

It was created by the 1926 union of the German-inhabited (formerly Sz\u00e1szr\u00e9gen) and the Hungarian-inhabited (formerly Magyarr\u00e9gen) city, and later joined with the two smaller communities of Apalina (Hungarian: ''Abaf\u00e1ja''; German: ''Bendorf'') and Iernu\u021beni (Hungarian: ''Radn\u00f3tf\u00e1ja''; German: ''Etschdorf''), added in 1956. Formally, the latter two are separate villages administered by the city.\n\n==History==\n[[File:ReghinChurch.jpg|thumb|190px|left|Transylvanian Saxons' Lutheran Church]]\nReghin was first mentioned in 1228 in a charter of [[List of Hungarian rulers|Hungarian King]] [[Andrew II of Hungary|Andrew II]] as ''Regun'' \u2013 however, evidence of its strategic location and defence system suggests that the town might have been considerably older, possibly founded by [[Ladislaus I of Hungary|Ladislaus I]].\n\nDespite the devastations of the city during the [[Mongol Empire|Mongol invasion]] (1241) and during the [[Tatar invasions|Tatar]] and [[Cumans|Cuman]] incursions (1285), the town developed rapidly: already in the second half of the 13th century the city was the residence and power centre of the families Tomaj and Kacsik, to whom the nearby lands were awarded by the Hungarian Crown. Reghin became a minor ecclesiastical centre in 1330, with the building of the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] church ([[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] at the time, it now serves the [[Protestant]] community) in the German part of the city; it is still the largest church in the area, and hosts the oldest [[Medieval Latin]] inscription of any church in Transylvania. The Hungarian part of the city has an even older church, initially built in the [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] style.\n\nAt the beginning of the 15th century the settlement gained [[Town privileges|city rights]], and, from 1427, the right to hold fairs. In the 16th and 17th century Reghin was devastated by [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg]] and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] troops on several occasions. It burned to the ground in 1848. In 1910, the population of the city included 7,310 inhabitants, of which 2,994 were [[Ethnic Germans|Germans]] ([[Transylvanian Saxons]]), 2,947 [[Magyars|Hungarians]], and 1,311 [[Romanians]]. [http://www.talmamedia.com/php/district/district.php?county=Maros-Torda]\n\nIn 1920 Reghin was assigned to Romania by the [[Treaty of Trianon]], together with the rest of Transylvania. In 1940, as a consequence of the [[Second Vienna Award]], the city became part of Hungary, together with the North of Transylvania. Almost 30% of the inhabitants were Jews at that time. In May 1944, the Jews were gathered in the [[Reghin ghetto]] and on 4 June 1944 were deported to Auschwitz. In 1945, the city again became part of Romania.\n\nAfter [[World War II]], Reghin lost some of its former Transylvanian Saxon character \u2013 as many Germans left for [[Western Germany]] during the latter stages of [[Communist Romania]] \u2013 and ethnic [[Romanians]] were settled in their place.  The data of the 1992 census showed a population of 24,601 Romanians, 12,471 Hungarian, 1,790 [[Romani people|Romani]], and 346 Germans. In 1994 Reghin was declared a [[Municipiu|city]].\n\n==Jewish history of Reghin==\n\n[[Jews]] began to settle in Reghin at the close of the 18th century, an organized community was established only during the middle of the 19th century, probably in 1849. The majority of the Jews came from [[Bukovina]] and [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]]. As a result of the battles during the Revolution of 1848 against Austria and the riots in Transylvania, Reghin and its Jewish population suffered severely. The first Jewish settlers, who arrived mainly from Bukovina and Galicia, were Orthodox, and the community remained Orthodox throughout its existence. [[\u1e24asidic]] influence was also felt. Besides the synagogue, there were two prayerhouses (kloyz) where the [[\u1e24asidim]] used to pray and had their own rabbis. A prominent figure in the community during its early years was the Orthodox [[rabbi]] Hillel Pollak (who was spiritually close to the extreme Orthodox rabbi Hillel Lichtenstein).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/reghin|title=Reghin|website=www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org}}</ref>\n\nA Jewish elementary school was founded in 1874. (Later it ceased its activities but was reestablished in 1910 and functioned until 1940.) The language of instruction in the school was Hungarian until 1918 after which it was Romanian. In 1885 the community became the administrative center for all the Jews of the district. The community numbered 282 in 1866, about 40 families in 1889, and 394 persons (about 7% of the total population) in 1891. Jews engaged in commerce, industry, and [[crafts]]. Their trade and industry were mainly connected with timber and some of them owned sawmills; there were also unskilled Jewish workers employed in the timber industry. The institutions of the community assisted the poor. Some of the \u1e24adarim established by the community translated the Pentateuch into German instead of [[Yiddish]] in order to facilitate study of this language by the children. From 1919 there was considerable Zionist activity in Reghin, and many members of the youth organizations emigrated to Ere\u1e93 Israel. The community numbered 1,587 (about 16% of the total population) in 1930, and 1,653 (about 10% of the total) in 1941.\n\nBetween the two world wars the Jews suffered from the nationalist and [[antisemitic]] activities of members of the [[Iron Guard]], and from the official antisemitic policies of most of the Romanian governments. The change of rule in 1940 (from Romanian to Hungarian) did not bring with it any improvement, as was hoped by the Jews, who remembered their legal emancipation in 1867 by the Austro-Hungarian authorities.\n\n===Holocaust and aftermath===\nIn the summer of 1944 the local Jews were concentrated into [[Reghin ghetto|a ghetto]] set up in a brick factory. Jews from the surrounding area were also brought there. From this [[ghetto]] about 6,000 Jews were deported to [[Auschwitz]] by the Hungarian authorities, at the request of the Nazi occupiers.\n\nAfter World War II, in 1947 a community numbering about 820 was formed mostly by survivors of the [[death camps]] and other Jews who had arrived in Reghin from places in different parts of Romania. The community gradually declined as a result of immigration to [[Israel]] and elsewhere. In 1971 there were still some 20 to 25 families living in Reghin and even fewer in the early 21st century.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Reghin|title=YIVO - Reghin|website=www.yivoencyclopedia.org}}</ref>\n\n==Architecture==\n\nReghin possesses some of the architectural elements that are unique in [[Transylvania]]. The stylistic details and the wrought iron balconies in the centre of the town are examples that prove the artistry of the local [[Artisan|craftsmen]]. One passes everyday by the apparently modest, yet defining signs of an ancient civilization. They personalize almost each and every building from the center of the town, making the visitor feel the fragrance of times gone by.<ref name=\"Costea\">{{cite book|last=Costea|first=Ioan I.|title=Reghin: Destin \u0219i istorie}}</ref>\n\nThe Evangelical church also known as the \"Saxon church\" has a tower that measures more than 47m high. The four smaller towers are proofs of the town's \"Right to the sword\". The construction of the church began at the end of the 13th century. Over the years, the architecture was modified because the church underwent many dramatic events. It was set on fire in 1400, 1630, and 1778. The documents reveal the use of several styles of early and transition [[Gothic style]]. The church was consolidated in 1501 and since 1551, when the Transylvanian Saxons adopted the [[Lutheran Reformation]], on the main wall are written the words: \"Redemption cometh not from war, it is for peace that we all pray.\". Inside the church there is an organ with 20 registers that dates from 1784.<ref name=\"Costea\"/>\n\nThe Huszar Castle, former Bornemisza, situated in Apalina dates from the 13th\u201314th centuries and was restored in the 19th century. In the old mansion of the castle lived between 1584 and 1592 Gyulai P\u00e1l of Apalina (1559\u20131592). He was a royal diplomat, historian, chronicler, doctor and classical poet. The castle was built in the [[Renaissance]] style with [[baroque]] elements. In 1953 the castle was taken over and used by different educational institutions for disabled persons. It has recently been returned to its owners according to the new laws of property.<ref name=\"Costea\"/>\n\n==Culture==\nThe \"Petru Maior\" municipal library has more than 130,000 books, among which one dating from the 16th century. Another important book is [[Petru Maior]]'s \"History of the Romanians' Origins in Dacia\".<ref name=\"Ploie\u0219teanu 2006\">{{cite book|last=Ploie\u0219teanu|first=Grigore |last2=\u0218ara |first2=Marin|title=Reghinul cultural|year=2006|location=Reghin}}</ref>\n\nThe Ethnographic Museum has a rich patrimony, grouped in 49 collections of ethnography, folk art, artistry, records. The edifice is a monument of architecture built in 1892. The items exhibited concern trades, national costumes, and tradition specific to the upper course of the [[Mure\u0219 River]], Gurghiu valley and part of the [[Transylvanian Plain]].<ref name=\"Ploie\u0219teanu 2006\"/>\n\nThe \"Eugen Nicoara\" community centre was built between 1938 and 1939 when Dr. [[Eugen Nicoara]] was the president of the Reghin department of Astra Foundation. Representations of theatre, folk music, dances, chamber music, etc. are held on the stage of this building.<ref name=\"Ploie\u0219teanu 2006\"/>\n\nThe building in which the \"Alexandru Ceusianu\" secondary school functions was constructed in 1870 and housed the local law court. Lately in the post-war period, there was the Hungarian pedagogical school. Close by, was the house of the writer and magistrate [[Alexandru Ceusianu]].<ref name=\"Ploie\u0219teanu 2006\"/>\n\n==Economy==\nThe industry of Reghin is closely related to the traditions of the medieval trades and of the modern cooperative associations. Starting with the resources in the close vicinity, rich in wood and farm produces, the goods of the private producers from Reghin are in the market all over Romania and abroad. The wood processing industry is represented by companies such as Larix, Gralemn, Remex, Bucin-Mob, Prolemn, and Amis. Reghin is well known for the industry of the musical instruments, especially of violins. There are many companies that produces instruments using the famous resonance wood from [[Gurghiu Mountains|Calimani and Gurghiu]] forests. The violins made in Reghin are used abroad. The \"Hora\" Company is the first to manufacture instruments. In time, other companies were set up among which \"Gliga Instrumente Muzicale\". [[Yehudi Menuhin]] used a violin made by \"Gliga\" company.<ref>{{cite book|last=Pop|first=Simion T. |title=Comorile Transilvaniei: REGHIN|year=2008|publisher=ROMGHID|location=Reghin|isbn=978-973-88446-1-2}}</ref>\n\n==Sport==\nReghin is presented by [[FCM Av\u00e2ntul Reghin|Av\u00e2ntul Reghin]] at association football.

It was created by the 1926 union of the German-inhabited (formerly Sz\u00e1szr\u00e9gen) and the Hungarian-inhabited (formerly Magyarr\u00e9gen) city, and later joined with the two smaller communities of Apalina (Hungarian: ''Abaf\u00e1ja''; German: ''Bendorf'') and Iernu\u021beni (Hungarian: ''Radn\u00f3tf\u00e1ja''; German: ''Etschdorf''), added in 1956. Formally, the latter two are separate villages administered by the city.\n\n==History==\n[[File:ReghinChurch.jpg|thumb|190px|left|Transylvanian Saxons' Lutheran Church]]\nReghin was first mentioned in 1228 in a charter of [[List of Hungarian rulers|Hungarian King]] [[Andrew II of Hungary|Andrew II]] as ''Regun'' \u2013 however, evidence of its strategic location and defence system suggests that the town might have been considerably older, possibly founded by [[Ladislaus I of Hungary|Ladislaus I]].\n\nDespite the devastations of the city during the [[Mongol Empire|Mongol invasion]] (1241) and during the [[Tatar invasions|Tatar]] and [[Cumans|Cuman]] incursions (1285), the town developed rapidly: already in the second half of the 13th century the city was the residence and power centre of the families Tomaj and Kacsik, to whom the nearby lands were awarded by the Hungarian Crown. Reghin became a minor ecclesiastical centre in 1330, with the building of the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] church ([[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] at the time, it now serves the [[Protestant]] community) in the German part of the city; it is still the largest church in the area, and hosts the oldest [[Medieval Latin]] inscription of any church in Transylvania. The Hungarian part of the city has an even older church, initially built in the [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] style.\n\nAt the beginning of the 15th century the settlement gained [[Town privileges|city rights]], and, from 1427, the right to hold fairs. In the 16th and 17th century Reghin was devastated by [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg]] and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] troops on several occasions. It burned to the ground in 1848. In 1910, the population of the city included 7,310 inhabitants, of which 2,994 were [[Ethnic Germans|Germans]] ([[Transylvanian Saxons]]), 2,947 [[Magyars|Hungarians]], and 1,311 [[Romanians]]. [http://www.talmamedia.com/php/district/district.php?county=Maros-Torda]\n\nIn 1920 Reghin was assigned to Romania by the [[Treaty of Trianon]], together with the rest of Transylvania. In 1940, as a consequence of the [[Second Vienna Award]], the city became part of Hungary, together with the North of Transylvania. Almost 30% of the inhabitants were Jews at that time. In May 1944, the Jews were gathered in the [[Reghin ghetto]] and on 4 June 1944 were deported to Auschwitz. In 1945, the city again became part of Romania.\n\nAfter [[World War II]], Reghin lost some of its former Transylvanian Saxon character \u2013 as many Germans left for [[Western Germany]] during the latter stages of [[Communist Romania]] \u2013 and ethnic [[Romanians]] were settled in their place.  The data of the 1992 census showed a population of 24,601 Romanians, 12,471 Hungarian, 1,790 [[Romani people|Romani]], and 346 Germans. In 1994 Reghin was declared a [[Municipiu|city]].\n\n==Jewish history of Reghin==\n\n[[Jews]] began to settle in Reghin at the close of the 18th century, an organized community was established only during the middle of the 19th century, probably in 1849. The majority of the Jews came from [[Bukovina]] and [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]]. As a result of the battles during the Revolution of 1848 against Austria and the riots in Transylvania, Reghin and its Jewish population suffered severely. The first Jewish settlers, who arrived mainly from Bukovina and Galicia, were Orthodox, and the community remained Orthodox throughout its existence. [[\u1e24asidic]] influence was also felt. Besides the synagogue, there were two prayerhouses (kloyz) where the [[\u1e24asidim]] used to pray and had their own rabbis. A prominent figure in the community during its early years was the Orthodox [[rabbi]] Hillel Pollak (who was spiritually close to the extreme Orthodox rabbi Hillel Lichtenstein).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/reghin|title=Reghin|website=www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org}}</ref>\n\nA Jewish elementary school was founded in 1874. (Later it ceased its activities but was reestablished in 1910 and functioned until 1940.) The language of instruction in the school was Hungarian until 1918 after which it was Romanian. In 1885 the community became the administrative center for all the Jews of the district. The community numbered 282 in 1866, about 40 families in 1889, and 394 persons (about 7% of the total population) in 1891. Jews engaged in commerce, industry, and [[crafts]]. Their trade and industry were mainly connected with timber and some of them owned sawmills; there were also unskilled Jewish workers employed in the timber industry. The institutions of the community assisted the poor. Some of the \u1e24adarim established by the community translated the Pentateuch into German instead of [[Yiddish]] in order to facilitate study of this language by the children. From 1919 there was considerable Zionist activity in Reghin, and many members of the youth organizations emigrated to Ere\u1e93 Israel. The community numbered 1,587 (about 16% of the total population) in 1930, and 1,653 (about 10% of the total) in 1941.\n\nBetween the two world wars the Jews suffered from the nationalist and [[antisemitic]] activities of members of the [[Iron Guard]], and from the official antisemitic policies of most of the Romanian governments. The change of rule in 1940 (from Romanian to Hungarian) did not bring with it any improvement, as was hoped by the Jews, who remembered their legal emancipation in 1867 by the Austro-Hungarian authorities.\n\n===Holocaust and aftermath===\nIn the summer of 1944 the local Jews were concentrated into [[Reghin ghetto|a ghetto]] set up in a brick factory. Jews from the surrounding area were also brought there. From this [[ghetto]] about 6,000 Jews were deported to [[Auschwitz]] by the Hungarian authorities, at the request of the Nazi occupiers.\n\nAfter World War II, in 1947 a community numbering about 820 was formed mostly by survivors of the [[death camps]] and other Jews who had arrived in Reghin from places in different parts of Romania. The community gradually declined as a result of immigration to [[Israel]] and elsewhere. In 1971 there were still some 20 to 25 families living in Reghin and even fewer in the early 21st century.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Reghin|title=YIVO - Reghin|website=www.yivoencyclopedia.org}}</ref>\n\n==Architecture==\nReghin possesses some of the architectural elements that are unique in [[Transylvania]]. The stylistic details and the wrought iron balconies in the centre of the town are examples that prove the artistry of the local [[Artisan|craftsmen]]. One passes everyday by the apparently modest, yet defining signs of an ancient civilization. They personalize almost each and every building from the center of the town, making the visitor feel the fragrance of times gone by.<ref name=\"Costea\">{{cite book|last=Costea|first=Ioan I. |title=Reghin: Destin \u0219i istorie}}</ref>\n\nThe Evangelical church also known as the \"Saxon church\" has a tower that measures more than 47m high. The four smaller towers are proofs of the town's \"Right to the sword\". The construction of the church began at the end of the 13th century. Over the years, the architecture was modified because the church underwent many dramatic events. It was set on fire in 1400, 1630 and 1778. The documents reveal the use of several styles of early and transition [[gothic style]]. The church was consolidated in 1501 and since 1551, when the Transylvanian Saxons adopted the [[Lutheran Reformation]], on the main wall are written the words: \"Redemption cometh not from war, it is for peace that we all pray.\". Inside the church there is an organ with 20 registers that dates from 1784.<ref name=\"Costea\"/>\n\nThe Huszar Castle, former Bornemisza, situated in Apalina dates from the 13th\u201314th centuries and was restored in the 19th century. In the old mansion of the castle lived between 1584 and 1592 Gyulai P\u00e1l of Apalina (1559\u20131592). He was a royal diplomat, historian, chronicler, doctor and classical poet. The castle was built in the [[Renaissance]] style with [[baroque]] elements. In 1953 the castle was taken over and used by different educational institutions for disabled persons. It has recently been returned to its owners according to the new laws of property.<ref name=\"Costea\"/>\n\n==Culture==\nThe \"Petru Maior\" municipal library has more than 130,000 books, among which one dating from the 16th century. Another important book is [[Petru Maior]]'s \"History of the Romanians' Origins in Dacia\".<ref name=\"Ploie\u0219teanu 2006\">{{cite book|last=Ploie\u0219teanu|first=Grigore |last2=\u0218ara |first2=Marin|title=Reghinul cultural|year=2006|location=Reghin}}</ref>\n\nThe Ethnographic Museum has a rich patrimony, grouped in 49 collections of ethnography, folk art, artistry, records. The edifice is a monument of architecture built in 1892. The items exhibited concern trades, national costumes, and tradition specific to the upper course of the [[Mure\u0219 River]], Gurghiu valley and part of the [[Transylvanian Plain]].<ref name=\"Ploie\u0219teanu 2006\"/>\n\nThe \"Eugen Nicoara\" community centre was built between 1938 and 1939 when Dr. [[Eugen Nicoara]] was the president of the Reghin department of Astra Foundation. Representations of theatre, folk music, dances, chamber music, etc. are held on the stage of this building.<ref name=\"Ploie\u0219teanu 2006\"/>\n\nThe building in which the \"Alexandru Ceusianu\" secondary school functions was constructed in 1870 and housed the local law court. Lately in the post-war period, there was the Hungarian pedagogical school. Close by, was the house of the writer and magistrate [[Alexandru Ceusianu]].<ref name=\"Ploie\u0219teanu 2006\"/>\n\n==Economy==\nThe industry of Reghin is closely related to the traditions of the medieval trades and of the modern cooperative associations. Starting with the resources in the close vicinity, rich in wood and farm produces, the goods of the private producers from Reghin are in the market all over Romania and abroad. The wood processing industry is represented by companies such as Larix, Gralemn, Remex, Bucin-Mob, Prolemn, and Amis. Reghin is well known for the industry of the musical instruments, especially of violins. There are many companies that produces instruments using the famous resonance wood from [[Gurghiu Mountains|Calimani and Gurghiu]] forests. The violins made in Reghin are used abroad. The \"Hora\" Company is the first to manufacture instruments. In time, other companies were set up among which \"Gliga Instrumente Muzicale\". [[Yehudi Menuhin]] used a violin made by \"Gliga\" company.<ref>{{cite book|last=Pop|first=Simion T. |title=Comorile Transilvaniei: REGHIN|year=2008|publisher=ROMGHID|location=Reghin|isbn=978-973-88446-1-2}}</ref>\n\n==Sport==\nReghin is presented by [[FCM Av\u00e2ntul Reghin|Av\u00e2ntul Reghin]] at association football.

Published originally in 2016, it was translated from Arabic into English February 12, 2019 by Leri Price. The story is set in Syria as three siblings--Bolbol, Hussein, and Fatima-- journey to complete their dead father's final wish of being buried next to his sister, Layla, in their hometown of Anabiya. The normally short drive turns into a few days' journey full of stress and violence as they must travel through warring territory with constant checkpoints they are stopped at. \n\nThe novel was one of the finalists of the [[National Book Award|National Book Awards]] and has been notably reviewed by numerous sources like the ''[[The Wall Street Journal]], [[Kirkus Reviews]],'' and ''[[Los Angeles Times|The Los Angeles Times]]''. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://us.macmillan.com/deathishardwork/khaledkhalifa/9780374135737|title=Death Is Hard Work {{!}} Khaled Khalifa {{!}} Macmillan|website=US Macmillan|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-06}}</ref>  \n\n== Background ==\nThe Syrian novel, ''Death is Hard Work'', was written in light of the ongoing [[Syrian civil war]] (2011-current). At this point, the Syrian civil war set a nation against itself. Chemical weapons were used to subdue the general population, sowing more distrust among an already-shattered nation. Multiple military sectors competed for the upper hand, making civilian life dangerous as towns and roads became war zones. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2013/08/27/world/meast/syria-civil-war-fast-facts/index.html|title=Syrian Civil War Fast Facts|last=Library|first=C.

The medical condition left him temporarily bed-bound in a hospital where he reflected, with the constant noise of bombs bursting in the background, on what would soon bring his novel to life. The question of what would happen to his body if he were to die during this wartime concerned him, and so he wrote on a familial conflict regarding a corpse needing burial within a war zone. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://syriadirect.org/news/syrian-author-khaled-khalifa-on-latest-novel-about-%e2%80%98fear-in-all-its-manifestations%e2%80%99/|title=Syrian author Khaled Khalifa on latest novel about \u2018fear, in all its manifestations\u2019|last=|first=|date=|website=Syria Direct|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-28}}</ref>\n\nConsiderable parallels are seen between the war in ''Death is Hard Work'' and the current Syrian civil war, as both show how war affects normal life.  Life could not be planned anymore, but must be taken step by step, for the road holds many trials. <ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/books/la-ca-jc-khaled-khalifa-death-is-hard-work-review-20190208-story.html|title=Khaled Khalifa\u2019s \u2018Death Is Hard Work\u2019 sheds light on life in the shadows of the Syrian War|last=|first=|date=2019-02-08|website=Los Angeles Times|language=en-US|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-28}}</ref>\n\n== Plot summary ==\nDuring the civil war in Syria, a rebel leader by the name of Abdel Latif al-Salim lay dying in a Damascene hospital. With his children Bolbol, Hussien, and Fatima crowded around, Abdel reveals his dying wish to be buried beside his sister Layla in his hometown of Anabiya. Bolbol steps up in front of his family and pledges to honor his father's wishes, regardless of the troubles that he may encounter along the way.\n\nAfter his father's death, Bolbol sets out with his siblings to cross Syria with Abdel's corpse in tow. This journey proves to be more complex than originally thought; with the addition of military checkpoints every few miles, a few hours journey is turned into a days-long odyssey.\n\nAt the first of many military checkpoints, the guards recognize Abdel's corpse, and set out to have his dead body arrested for crimes against the regime. After much discussion with many guards, Bolbol manages to bribe the dead man's way to freedom, allowing the group to continue their voyage. As similar events continue to occur with each passing checkpoint, Bolbol contemplates how easy this journey would be if only they were transporting sacks of cumin rather than a dead body. This leads Bolbol to reminiscence on his past, recalling particular details of his youth, such as the neighborhood he grew up in, and the practical effects of being raised during wartime.\n\nAfter calling in a favor, the group stops at  Bolbol's childhood friend, Lamia's, house after dropping Abdel's body off in the local morgue for the night. Over the course of their stay, Lamia and her husband, Zuhayr, offer to help the group pass the next few checkpoints with relative ease, due to Zuhayr's family connections to the regime. It is also revealed that Lamia used to be an object of Bolbol's obsession, but their relationship was never directly addressed. Bolbol spends the night longing for the old days, when he was in love with Lamia. This leads directly into Bolbol recounting an old story regarding the relationship between Abdel and his wife, Navine, particularly from when they met, to when they got married.\n\nWith the corpse rapidly decaying, the guards at each checkpoint being to provide leniency  to the group more readily, allowing them swifter passage just to be rid of the sight. After the group passes a man's half-eaten corpse, an argument breaks out between Bolbol and Hussein about how easy it would be to simply leave their father's corpse there to be eaten by wolves, and no one would be the wiser. This leads Bolbol to provide backstory on Hussein, explaining his tendencies to overreact and lash out at loved ones, and his long history of causing trouble with family. Meanwhile, the corpse's decay has gotten to the point where the scent can no longer be masked with cologne.\n\nAfter stopping for the night in their van, the group is attacked by wild dogs after the scent of the corpse, leaving the siblings panicked and increasingly on-edge. At the peak of this panic, Hussein picks a fight with Bolbol, who goes down quite easily with a few punches. The stress of their journey has begun to break the siblings, as they all resolve to sob in silence for the night.\n\nAfter passing through several more checkpoints, the group is stopped by an extremist group, who end up withholding passage from Bolbol until he completes a \"religious reeducation course.\" Left with no other choice, Hussein and Fatima continue on without Bolbol, even more determined to reach Anabiya now that the corpse shows signs of maggot infestation. The two siblings reach Anabiya before sundown, and meet with a cousin of theirs: the only surviving relative in the village. Plans are made to bury the body at morning prayer. Bolbol arrives at the village and rejoins his siblings without a word. That night, each sibling reflects on how little they desire to see each other after the burial.\n\nAfter the burial, Bolbol resolves to be addressed only by his original name, Nabil. Fatima has gone mute from the shock of the journey. Hussein quite uncharacteristically keeps to himself. The siblings begin their journey home, and each show a large degree of relief as they pass through the checkpoints with ease, now that they are not in possession of their father's corpse. Hussein and Fatima drop Bolbol off at his neighborhood in Damascus, and leave without exchanging words.

Published originally in 2016, it was translated from Arabic into English February 12, 2019 by Leri Price. The story is set in Syria as three siblings--Bolbol, Hussein, and Fatima-- journey to complete their dead father's final wish of being buried next to his sister, Layla, in their hometown of Anabiya. The normally short drive turns into a few days' journey full of stress and violence as they must travel through warring territory with constant checkpoints they are stopped at. \n\nThe novel was one of the finalists of the [[National Book Award|National Book Awards]] and has been notably reviewed by numerous sources like the ''[[The Wall Street Journal]], [[Kirkus Reviews]],'' and ''[[Los Angeles Times|The Los Angeles Times]]''. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://us.macmillan.com/deathishardwork/khaledkhalifa/9780374135737|title=Death Is Hard Work {{!}} Khaled Khalifa {{!}} Macmillan|website=US Macmillan|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-06}}</ref>  \n\n== Background ==\nThe Syrian novel, ''Death is Hard Work'', was written in light of the ongoing [[Syrian civil war]] (2011-current). At this point, the Syrian civil war set a nation against itself. Chemical weapons were used to subdue the general population, sowing more distrust among an already-shattered nation. Multiple military sectors competed for the upper hand, making civilian life dangerous as towns and roads became war zones. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2013/08/27/world/meast/syria-civil-war-fast-facts/index.html|title=Syrian Civil War Fast Facts|last=Library|first=C.

The medical condition left him temporarily bed-bound in a hospital where he reflected, with the constant noise of bombs bursting in the background, on what would soon bring his novel to life. The question of what would happen to his body if he were to die during this wartime concerned him, and so he wrote on a familial conflict regarding a corpse needing burial within a war zone. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://syriadirect.org/news/syrian-author-khaled-khalifa-on-latest-novel-about-%e2%80%98fear-in-all-its-manifestations%e2%80%99/|title=Syrian author Khaled Khalifa on latest novel about \u2018fear, in all its manifestations\u2019|last=|first=|date=|website=Syria Direct|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-28}}</ref>\n\nConsiderable parallels are seen between the war in ''Death is Hard Work'' and the current Syrian civil war, as both show how war affects normal life.  Life could not be planned anymore, but must be taken step by step, for the road holds many trials. <ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/books/la-ca-jc-khaled-khalifa-death-is-hard-work-review-20190208-story.html|title=Khaled Khalifa\u2019s \u2018Death Is Hard Work\u2019 sheds light on life in the shadows of the Syrian War|last=|first=|date=2019-02-08|website=Los Angeles Times|language=en-US|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-28}}</ref>\n\n== Plot summary ==\nDuring the civil war in Syria, a rebel leader by the name of Abdel Latif al-Salim lay dying in a Damascene hospital. With his children Bolbol, Hussien, and Fatima crowded around, Abdel reveals his dying wish to be buried beside his sister Layla in his hometown of Anabiya. Bolbol steps up in front of his family and pledges to honor his father's wishes, regardless of the troubles that he may encounter along the way.\n\nAfter his father's death, Bolbol sets out with his siblings to cross Syria with Abdel's corpse in tow. This journey proves to be more complex than originally thought; with the addition of military checkpoints every few miles, a few hours journey is turned into a days-long odyssey.\n\nAt the first of many military checkpoints, the guards recognize Abdel's corpse, and set out to have his dead body arrested for crimes against the regime. After much discussion with many guards, Bolbol manages to bribe the dead man's way to freedom, allowing the group to continue their voyage. As similar events continue to occur with each passing checkpoint, Bolbol contemplates how easy this journey would be if only they were transporting sacks of cumin rather than a dead body. This leads Bolbol to reminiscence on his past, recalling particular details of his youth, such as the neighborhood he grew up in, and the practical effects of being raised during wartime.\n\nAfter calling in a favor, the group stops at  Bolbol's childhood friend, Lamia's, house after dropping Abdel's body off in the local morgue for the night. Over the course of their stay, Lamia and her husband, Zuhayr, offer to help the group pass the next few checkpoints with relative ease, due to Zuhayr's family connections to the regime. It is also revealed that Lamia used to be an object of Bolbol's obsession, but their relationship was never directly addressed. Bolbol spends the night longing for the old days, when he was in love with Lamia. This leads directly into Bolbol recounting an old story regarding the relationship between Abdel and his wife, Navine, particularly from when they met, to when they got married.\n\nWith the corpse rapidly decaying, the guards at each checkpoint being to provide leniency  to the group more readily, allowing them swifter passage just to be rid of the sight. After the group passes a man's half-eaten corpse, an argument breaks out between Bolbol and Hussein about how easy it would be to simply leave their father's corpse there to be eaten by wolves, and no one would be the wiser. This leads Bolbol to provide backstory on Hussein, explaining his tendencies to overreact and lash out at loved ones, and his long history of causing trouble with family. Meanwhile, the corpse's decay has gotten to the point where the scent can no longer be masked with cologne.\n\nAfter stopping for the night in their van, the group is attacked by wild dogs after the scent of the corpse, leaving the siblings panicked and increasingly on-edge. At the peak of this panic, Hussein picks a fight with Bolbol, who goes down quite easily with a few punches. The stress of their journey has begun to break the siblings, as they all resolve to sob in silence for the night.\n\nAfter passing through several more checkpoints, the group is stopped by an extremist group, who end up withholding passage from Bolbol until he completes a \"religious reeducation course.\" Left with no other choice, Hussein and Fatima continue on without Bolbol, even more determined to reach Anabiya now that the corpse shows signs of maggot infestation.
