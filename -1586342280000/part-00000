The king, educated by Westerners, was keen on copying the system of government of the absolute monarchs of Europe. At first he created two councils: the \"Privy Council of Siam\" ({{lang-th|\u0e17\u0e35\u0e48\u0e1b\u0e24\u0e01\u0e29\u0e32\u0e43\u0e19\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e30\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e04\u0e4c}}; {{rtgs|''thi prueksa nai phra ong''}}) (49 members) and the \"Council of State\" ({{lang-th|\u0e2a\u0e20\u0e32\u0e17\u0e35\u0e48\u0e1b\u0e23\u0e36\u0e01\u0e29\u0e32\u0e23\u0e32\u0e0a\u0e01\u0e32\u0e23\u0e41\u0e1c\u0e48\u0e19\u0e14\u0e34\u0e19}}; {{rtgs|''sapha thi prueksa ratchakan phaendin''}}) (12 members, name later changed to \"Council of Ministers\" ({{lang-th|\u0e23\u0e31\u0e10\u0e21\u0e19\u0e15\u0e23\u0e35\u0e2a\u0e20\u0e32}}; {{rtgs|''ratthamontrisapha''}})). The privy council was created to deal with legislative affairs while the latter became an early version of the [[Cabinet of Thailand|cabinet]].\n\nChulalongkorn was succeeded by his son King [[Vajiravudh]] (Rama VI) in 1910, who at the beginning of his reign appointed a 40-member \"Privy Council of State\" ({{lang-th|\u0e2a\u0e20\u0e32\u0e01\u0e23\u0e23\u0e21\u0e01\u0e32\u0e23\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e04\u0e21\u0e19\u0e15\u0e23\u0e35}}; {{rtgs|''sapha kammakan ongkhamontri''}}). The king, during his 15 years on the throne, would continue to appoint new members at [[Thai New Year]] (or 4 April). When he died in 1925 the privy council was composed of 233 members.\n\nKing [[Prajadhipok]] (Rama VII) who succeeded his brother in 1925, completely overhauled the system and created instead three councils: The \"[[Supreme Council of State of Siam]]\" ({{lang-th|\u0e2d\u0e20\u0e34\u0e23\u0e31\u0e10\u0e21\u0e19\u0e15\u0e23\u0e35\u0e2a\u0e20\u0e32}}; {{rtgs|''aphiratthamontrisapha''}}) (composed of five senior princes, equivalent to the former Council of State); The \"Council of Secretaries\" ({{lang-th|\u0e40\u0e2a\u0e19\u0e32\u0e1a\u0e14\u0e35\u0e2a\u0e20\u0e32}}; {{rtgs|''senabodisapha''}}) (former Council of Ministers); and the Privy Council of State. The role of the Privy Council was relegated to minor legislative affairs, while the Supreme Council became Prajadhipok's main body of advisors.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://kanchanapisek.or.th/ohmpc/history.en.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-01-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090209084550/http://kanchanapisek.or.th/ohmpc/history.en.php |archivedate=2009-02-09 }}</ref>\n\nOn 24 June 1932, a group calling themselves the [[Khana Ratsadon]] (or People's Party), together with the military, [[Siamese revolution of 1932|seized power in Bangkok]]. They abolished the system of absolute monarchy, changing Siam into a parliamentary [[constitutional monarchy]] and demanding of Prajadhipok a constitution for the people of Siam. The king granted them a \"temporary\" constitution in the same month and a permanent one in December. The Khana Ratsadon, once in power, abolished the Supreme Council and the Privy Council. They replaced the Council of Secretaries with the [[People's Committee of Siam]].\n\nIt was not until fifteen years later that the 1947 constitution of Siam recreated the Privy Council under King [[Bhumibol Adulyadej]], with a name change to \"Supreme Council of State\" ({{lang-th|\u0e04\u0e13\u0e30\u0e2d\u0e20\u0e34\u0e23\u0e31\u0e10\u0e21\u0e19\u0e15\u0e23\u0e35}}; {{rtgs|''khana aphiratthamontri''}}). This council existed from 1947 to 1949 and was composed of:\n[[File:Rama IX at a meeting of the Privy Council.jpg|thumb|[[King Rama IX]] at a meeting of the Privy Council in 1953]]\n* Prince [[Rangsit Prayurasakdi]], Prince of Chainat, President of the council\n* Prince [[Dhani Nivat]], Prince Bidyalabh Bridhyakon\n* Prince [[Alongkot]], Prince Adisorn Udomsak\n* Phraya Manavaratsevi (Plod Vichear na Songkhla)\n* Police General Adul Aduldejjarus\n\nTwo years later, under the 1949 Constitution of Thailand, the council was renamed the \"Privy Council of Thailand\" ({{lang-th|\u0e2a\u0e20\u0e32\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e04\u0e21\u0e19\u0e15\u0e23\u0e35}}; {{rtgs|''sapha ongkhamontri''}}) or ({{lang-th|\u0e04\u0e13\u0e30\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e04\u0e21\u0e19\u0e15\u0e23\u0e35}}; {{rtgs|''khana ongkhamontri''}}). The Privy Council in its current form was created by the [[2017 Constitution of Thailand]].\n\n==Members==\nThe present constitution stipulated that the council is composed of no more than eighteen members. The members of the Privy Council or Privy Councillors are appointed and removed at the pleasure of the king alone, but appointments must be countersigned by the President of the Privy Council.<ref>[http://www.senate.go.th/eng/T-E_Senate/E_T_02.htm Constitution of Thailand] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20070628200818/http://www.senate.go.th/eng/T-E_Senate/E_T_02.htm |date=2007-06-28 }}</ref>\n\nThe councillors cannot be partisan and therefore cannot be members of the [[House of Representatives of Thailand|House of Representatives]], [[Senate of Thailand]], [[Election Commission (Thailand)|Election Commission]], [[Ombudsman]], member of the [[National Human Rights Commission (Thailand)|National Human Rights Commission]], judge of the [[Constitutional Court of Thailand|Constitutional Court]], judge of an Administrative Court, member of the National Counter Corruption Commission, member of the State Audit Commission, a government official holding a permanent position or receiving a permanent salary, an official of a state enterprise, other state official or holder of other position of member or official of a political party, and must not manifest loyalty to any [[List of political parties in Thailand|political party]]. Privy councillors are not prohibited from sitting on the boards of influential companies and, under Prem, some councillors are board members of [[Bangkok Bank]], [[Charoen Pokphand]], the [[Boon Rawd Brewery|Boonrawd group]], and the Charoen Siriwatanapakdi business group.<ref name=\"Diplomat-20181012\" />\n\nAfter being appointed the councilors must take the following oath in the presence of the king to assume office:\n\n<blockquote>\n\"I, (name of the declarer), do solemnly declare that I will be loyal to His Majesty the King and will faithfully perform my duties in the interests of the country and of the people. I will also uphold and observe the Constitution of the Kingdom of Thailand in every respect.\"\n</blockquote>\n\nA councillor vacates office upon death, resignation, or at royal command.\n\n===President===\nThe President of the Privy Council of Thailand is the head and chief councillor of the privy council. The king retains the power to appoint and remove the president, however the President of the [[National Assembly of Thailand]] must countersign presidential appointments and removals, unlike other councillors which the king alone decides.\n\n==Functions==\n{{Politics of Thailand}}\nThe 2017 Constitution gave the privy council many roles and powers. These are mostly associated with the issues surrounding the head of state and the monarchy. A US ambassador described its duties thus, \"Statutorily they exist to offer advice to the King if he solicits it, review petitions on his behalf, act as ceremonial stand-ins for the King at various royally-sponsored ceremonies, and play a critical role in succession.\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=John|first1=Eric G|title=Thailand: Circles of Influence Inside the Institution of the Monarchy in King Bhumibol's Twilight| url=https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/09BANGKOK2967_a.html| website=Wikileaks|publisher=US Embassy|accessdate=17 October 2016|ref=09BANGKOK2967_a|location=Bangkok|page=22|date=2009-11-23}}</ref>\n\n===Regency===\n{{main|Regent of Thailand}}\nIf the king is incapacitated or for whatever reason and cannot appoint a [[regent]], the privy council will submit to the National Assembly the name of a suitable individual, who must then be approved by a vote. During the period where there is no regent the President of the Privy Council shall be the regent [[pro tempore]]. This case is also applicable if the regent is incapacitated and cannot perform his duties. When this happens the President of the Privy Council shall be replaced in his duties to the council by a president pro tempore.\n\n===Palace Law of Succession===\nIn regards to the amendment of the [[1924 Palace Law of Succession]], the king must ask the privy council to draft an amendment. After the king's approval and signature, the President of the Privy Council will notify the president of the National Assembly that will then countersign such amendment.\n\n===Vacancy on the throne===\nWhen the throne becomes vacant it is the duty of the privy council to submit to the cabinet and to the [[National Assembly of Thailand|National Assembly]] the name of the successor to the throne. During this vacancy period (before the submission) the President of the Privy Council will be the regent pro tempore.\n\n===Other functions===\nApart from these constitutionally mandated functions the privy councillors also perform other duties. For instance, they carry out other duties in the royal household and on royal projects.

The king, educated by Westerners, was keen on copying the system of government of the absolute monarchs of Europe. At first he created two councils: the \"Privy Council of Siam\" ({{lang-th|\u0e17\u0e35\u0e48\u0e1b\u0e24\u0e01\u0e29\u0e32\u0e43\u0e19\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e30\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e04\u0e4c}}; {{rtgs|''thi prueksa nai phra ong''}}) (49 members) and the \"Council of State\" ({{lang-th|\u0e2a\u0e20\u0e32\u0e17\u0e35\u0e48\u0e1b\u0e23\u0e36\u0e01\u0e29\u0e32\u0e23\u0e32\u0e0a\u0e01\u0e32\u0e23\u0e41\u0e1c\u0e48\u0e19\u0e14\u0e34\u0e19}}; {{rtgs|''sapha thi prueksa ratchakan phaendin''}}) (12 members, name later changed to \"Council of Ministers\" ({{lang-th|\u0e23\u0e31\u0e10\u0e21\u0e19\u0e15\u0e23\u0e35\u0e2a\u0e20\u0e32}}; {{rtgs|''ratthamontrisapha''}})). The privy council was created to deal with legislative affairs while the latter became an early version of the [[Cabinet of Thailand|cabinet]].\n\nChulalongkorn was succeeded by his son King [[Vajiravudh]] (Rama VI) in 1910, who at the beginning of his reign appointed a 40-member \"Privy Council of State\" ({{lang-th|\u0e2a\u0e20\u0e32\u0e01\u0e23\u0e23\u0e21\u0e01\u0e32\u0e23\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e04\u0e21\u0e19\u0e15\u0e23\u0e35}}; {{rtgs|''sapha kammakan ongkhamontri''}}). The king, during his 15 years on the throne, would continue to appoint new members at [[Thai New Year]] (or 4 April). When he died in 1925 the privy council was composed of 233 members.\n\nKing [[Prajadhipok]] (Rama VII) who succeeded his brother in 1925, completely overhauled the system and created instead three councils: The \"[[Supreme Council of State of Siam]]\" ({{lang-th|\u0e2d\u0e20\u0e34\u0e23\u0e31\u0e10\u0e21\u0e19\u0e15\u0e23\u0e35\u0e2a\u0e20\u0e32}}; {{rtgs|''aphiratthamontrisapha''}}) (composed of five senior princes, equivalent to the former Council of State); The \"Council of Secretaries\" ({{lang-th|\u0e40\u0e2a\u0e19\u0e32\u0e1a\u0e14\u0e35\u0e2a\u0e20\u0e32}}; {{rtgs|''senabodisapha''}}) (former Council of Ministers); and the Privy Council of State.

They abolished the system of absolute monarchy, changing Siam into a parliamentary [[constitutional monarchy]] and demanding of Prajadhipok a constitution for the people of Siam. The king granted them a \"temporary\" constitution in the same month and a permanent one in December. The Khana Ratsadon, once in power, abolished the Supreme Council and the Privy Council. They replaced the Council of Secretaries with the [[People's Committee of Siam]].\n\nIt was not until fifteen years later that the 1947 constitution of Siam recreated the Privy Council under King [[Bhumibol Adulyadej]], with a name change to \"Supreme Council of State\" ({{lang-th|\u0e04\u0e13\u0e30\u0e2d\u0e20\u0e34\u0e23\u0e31\u0e10\u0e21\u0e19\u0e15\u0e23\u0e35}}; {{rtgs|''khana aphiratthamontri''}}). This council existed from 1947 to 1949 and was composed of:\n[[File:Rama IX at a meeting of the Privy Council.jpg|thumb|[[King Rama IX]] at a meeting of the Privy Council in 1953]]\n* Prince [[Rangsit Prayurasakdi]], Prince of Chainat, President of the council\n* Prince [[Dhani Nivat]], Prince Bidyalabh Bridhyakon\n* Prince [[Alongkot]], Prince Adisorn Udomsak\n* Phraya Manavaratsevi (Plod Vichear na Songkhla)\n* Police General Adul Aduldejjarus\n\nTwo years later, under the 1949 Constitution of Thailand, the council was renamed the \"Privy Council of Thailand\" ({{lang-th|\u0e2a\u0e20\u0e32\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e04\u0e21\u0e19\u0e15\u0e23\u0e35}}; {{rtgs|''sapha ongkhamontri''}}) or ({{lang-th|\u0e04\u0e13\u0e30\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e04\u0e21\u0e19\u0e15\u0e23\u0e35}}; {{rtgs|''khana ongkhamontri''}}). The Privy Council in its current form was created by the [[2017 Constitution of Thailand]].\n\n==Members==\nThe present constitution stipulated that the council is composed of no more than eighteen members. The members of the Privy Council or Privy Councillors are appointed and removed at the pleasure of the king alone, but appointments must be countersigned by the President of the Privy Council.<ref>[http://www.senate.go.th/eng/T-E_Senate/E_T_02.htm Constitution of Thailand] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20070628200818/http://www.senate.go.th/eng/T-E_Senate/E_T_02.htm |date=2007-06-28 }}</ref>\n\nThe councillors cannot be partisan and therefore cannot be members of the [[House of Representatives of Thailand|House of Representatives]], [[Senate of Thailand]], [[Election Commission (Thailand)|Election Commission]], [[Ombudsman]], member of the [[National Human Rights Commission (Thailand)|National Human Rights Commission]], judge of the [[Constitutional Court of Thailand|Constitutional Court]], judge of an Administrative Court, member of the National Counter Corruption Commission, member of the State Audit Commission, a government official holding a permanent position or receiving a permanent salary, an official of a state enterprise, other state official or holder of other position of member or official of a political party, and must not manifest loyalty to any [[List of political parties in Thailand|political party]]. Privy councillors are not prohibited from sitting on the boards of influential companies and, under Prem, some councillors are board members of [[Bangkok Bank]], [[Charoen Pokphand]], the [[Boon Rawd Brewery|Boonrawd group]], and the Charoen Siriwatanapakdi business group.<ref name=\"Diplomat-20181012\" />\n\nAfter being appointed the councilors must take the following oath in the presence of the king to assume office:\n\n<blockquote>\n\"I, (name of the declarer), do solemnly declare that I will be loyal to His Majesty the King and will faithfully perform my duties in the interests of the country and of the people. I will also uphold and observe the Constitution of the Kingdom of Thailand in every respect.\"\n</blockquote>\n\nA councillor vacates office upon death, resignation, or at royal command.\n\n===President===\nThe President of the Privy Council of Thailand is the head and chief councillor of the privy council. The king retains the power to appoint and remove the president, however the President of the [[National Assembly of Thailand]] must countersign presidential appointments and removals, unlike other councillors which the king alone decides.\n\n==Functions==\n{{Politics of Thailand}}\nThe 2017 Constitution gave the privy council many roles and powers. These are mostly associated with the issues surrounding the head of state and the monarchy. A US ambassador described its duties thus, \"Statutorily they exist to offer advice to the King if he solicits it, review petitions on his behalf, act as ceremonial stand-ins for the King at various royally-sponsored ceremonies, and play a critical role in succession.\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=John|first1=Eric G|title=Thailand: Circles of Influence Inside the Institution of the Monarchy in King Bhumibol's Twilight| url=https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/09BANGKOK2967_a.html| website=Wikileaks|publisher=US Embassy|accessdate=17 October 2016|ref=09BANGKOK2967_a|location=Bangkok|page=22|date=2009-11-23}}</ref>\n\n===Regency===\n{{main|Regent of Thailand}}\nIf the king is incapacitated or for whatever reason and cannot appoint a [[regent]], the privy council will submit to the National Assembly the name of a suitable individual, who must then be approved by a vote. During the period where there is no regent the President of the Privy Council shall be the regent [[pro tempore]]. This case is also applicable if the regent is incapacitated and cannot perform his duties. When this happens the President of the Privy Council shall be replaced in his duties to the council by a president pro tempore.\n\n===Palace Law of Succession===\nIn regards to the amendment of the [[1924 Palace Law of Succession]], the king must ask the privy council to draft an amendment. After the king's approval and signature, the President of the Privy Council will notify the president of the National Assembly that will then countersign such amendment.\n\n===Vacancy on the throne===\nWhen the throne becomes vacant it is the duty of the privy council to submit to the cabinet and to the [[National Assembly of Thailand|National Assembly]] the name of the successor to the throne. During this vacancy period (before the submission) the President of the Privy Council will be the regent pro tempore.\n\n===Other functions===\nApart from these constitutionally mandated functions the privy councillors also perform other duties. For instance, they carry out other duties in the royal household and on royal projects. Several councillors are members of the Mahidol Foundation, while Dr. Chaovana Nasylvanta is the Director of the [[Crown Property Bureau]]. Councillors can, at royal command, attend official functions or carry out official duties on behalf of the king or the [[Chakri Dynasty|royal family]].\n\n== List of presidents of the Privy Council==\n\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n!  ||Name|| Dates as President\n|-\n| 1 || Prince [[Dhani Nivat]] || 18 June 1949 \u2013 25 March 1950\n|-\n| 2 || Prince [[Rangsit Prayurasakdi]] || 25 March 1950 \u2013 7 March 1951\n|-\n| 3 || Prince [[Alongkot]] || 13 March 1951 \u2013 29 November 1951\n|-\n| \u2013 || [[Jit na Songkhla]] || 27 May 1963 \u2013 14 July 1963\n|-\n| 4 || M.L.

Spanish nobles resided in Flanders in the 15th and 16th centuries and married in to local houses.

Today, most important families still pass these old titles only in the male line.

Mostly, the noble status was recognized but sometimes too the old title, that could only be passed by the male line of the same noble house. Since this change, old titles have disappeared, and only few old titles survive. Known examples are the [[house of colo|counts of Bornhem]] and the [[Marquess of Assche]] titles inherited by the families of [[Marnix de Sainte-Aldegonde]] and Vander Noot.\n\n=== North of France ===\nUntil 1662 the North part of France belonged to Flanders, under Spanish rule. Titles created before this date are considered to be part of the Flemish nobility.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}} The Picardian and Artesian nobility lost their land to the French Crown, and was incorporated into the French Kingdom. The [[Marquess of Morbecque]] had lost his land after the [[Battle of Cassel (1677)|Battle of Cassel]]. After this periode much former Flemish houses, were bestowed other French titles.\n\n;examples\n* Creation in 1674 by Louis XIV: [[Marquess of Saint-Floris]], title of the Flemish house of Ghistelles.\n* Creation in 1705 by Louis XIV: [[Marquess of Becelaere]], title of the Flemish house of de la Woestyne.\n\n=== Current role of the nobility===\nDuring the Austrian period, the high nobility participated in the government, both political and at the [[Lord Chamberlain of the Archduchess|imperial court of Brussels]]. Since the French Revolution the nobility has not played a social function. However some members of most old families worked in major functions in Belgium.\n\n==Characteristics==\n[[File:Blason Lannoy.jpg|thumb|The House of Lannoy]]\n[[File:Croy-Wappen 093 4.png|thumb|Crest of the House of Croy]]\n[[File:LimburgStirum.jpg|thumb|House of Limburg-Stirum]]\n[[File:Armoiries de la Maison de Lalaing.png|thumb|The house of Lalaing]]\n[[File:Wapen van de familie d'Udekem d'Acoz.svg|thumb|the House of Udekem d\u00b4Acoz]]\n[[File:Kasteel de Merode 1.jpg|thumb|the Castle of the Prince de Merode.]]\n[[File:V\u00eaves CH1aJPG.jpg|thumb|V\u00eaves castle is the residence of Count de Liedekerke Beaufort]]\n[[File:Kasteel van Ooidonk.JPG|thumb|Kasteel van Ooidonk, residence of the House of t'Kint de Roodenbeke]]\n[[File:0 Dr\u00e9hance - Ch\u00e2teau de Walzin (2).JPG|thumb|Walzin Castle, residence of the House of Limburg-Stirum]]\nThe modern Belgian nobility is known to be mostly [[tradition]]alist, and [[monarchism|royalist]]. In the [[Belgium|Kingdom of Belgium]] there were {{As of|2013|lc=on}} approximately 1,300 noble families, with some 20,000 members. The noble lineage of only approximately 400 families dates back to the 17th century or earlier. As Belgium is a democratic [[constitutional monarchy]] there are no legal privileges attached to bearing a noble title or to being a member of the aristocracy. According to article 113 of the constitution, \"The King may confer titles of nobility, without ever having the power to attach privileges to them\".<ref>[http://www.const-court.be/en/basic_text/belgian_constitution.pdf article 113, constitution]</ref>\n\n=== Wealth ===\nMany nobles in Belgium still belong to the [[elite]] of society. They sometimes own and manage companies, or have leading positions in cultural society, business, banking, diplomacy, [[NGO]]s etc. Many of the older families still own (and reside in) important [[castle]]s or [[Rural area|country]] [[Estate (land)|house]]s (see: [[Castles in Belgium]]).\n\nThe fortune of the nobility is impressive: only 11% of the 500 wealthiest families in Belgium are members of the nobility, however: they have more than 56% of this wealth, 79.85 billion euros.<ref>http://www.tijd.be/politiek-economie/belgie-federaal/Rijkste-Belgische-adel-bezit-80-miljard-euro/9870835?ckc=1&ts=1490009474</ref>\nThis is partly caused by the fact that many of the new noble titles are bestowed on wealthy entrepreneurs, like the families of [[B\u00f6el|Bo\u00ebl]], [[Albert Fr\u00e8re|Frere]], [[Colruyt family|Colruyt]], Janssens and [[Ernest Solvay|Solvay]]. Old houses however are in minority and have sold lots of their lands and estates. The [[house of Merode]] has sold during the ages thousands of hectares of their own private lands.<ref>http://www.lecho.be/dossier/noblesse/Les-chateaux-de-la-noblesse/9873497?ckc=1&ts=1490394093</ref> Other houses have still immense lands and grounds, but most houses have lost much of their historic wealth.\n\n=== Surname of the House, and division of the families ===\nLike most European nobility, the family name says much of the origin of the house. Normally the name of the family or House cannot change, however it used to be possible. A famous example was [[Conrad III Schetz]]: he had himself adopted by his aunt and changed his surname, for him and all his descendants from [[Schetz]] to [[Ursel family|van Ursel]].\n\nEvery noble family has its own coat of arms and titles: both are legally protected from copyright. People who do not belong to the house, are forbidden to use the titles or the coat of arms.\n\n== Legal identity ==\nIn Belgium the title forms part of the identity of the noble person and is mentioned on the ID-card. The title is not a part of the name though.<ref>http://diplomatie.belgium.be/nl/Diensten/Protocol/adel/faq</ref>\n\nAssumption of noble titles by those not entitled to any is prohibited and is punishable with a fine of 200 to 1000 euros under article 230 of the Belgian penal code.\n\n== Ennoblement ==\nBelgium is one of the few monarchies in the world in which hereditary [[ennoblement]] still occurs regularly. Hereditary titles are conferred by [[letters patent]], which are in general annually issued by the [[King of the Belgians]]. Noble titles can also be granted for life.\n\nBelgian citizens distinguished in business, politics, science, arts, sports, etc. or for extraordinary service to the kingdom may receive noble status or noble titles.\n\nBy royal decree the monarch can extend, change or upgrade the rank of members of a noble house or change the rank of the whole family.\n\n==Structure of the Belgian nobility==\n[[File:Elizabeth, Comtesse Greffulhe 1905 , by Philip Alexius de Laszlo.jpg|thumb|[[\u00c9lisabeth, Countess Greffulhe]], \"queen\" of Parisian society during the ''[[fin de siecle]]'', was a member of the princely family of [[Chimay]].]]\n[[File:Comtesse Vilain XIIII JLDavid.jpg|thumb|The [[Vilain XIIII|Viscountess Vilain XIIII]], who had great wealth had her portrait painted by [[Jacques-Louis David]].]]\n[[File:Wolfgang-Willem.jpg|thumb|{{Interlanguage link multi|Wolfgang Willem of Ursel|nl|3=Wolfgang Willem van Ursel}}, the third duke of Ursel 1750-1804]]\n[[File:Henri graaf 't Kint de Roodenbeke, voorzitter van de Senaat, 1892-1899.jpg|thumb|Henri t' Kint de Roodenbeke, Senate of Belgium]]\n[[File:General Jacques de Dixmude.jpg|thumb|General [[Alphonse Jacques de Dixmude|Alphonse, 1st Baron Jacques de Dixmude]]]]\n[[File:Joseph de Riquet de Caraman-Chimay (1836-1892) B.jpg|thumb|Joseph de Riquet de Caraman-Chimay]]\n[[File:Emmanuel de M\u00e9rode.jpg|thumb|Prince [[Emmanuel de M\u00e9rode]], Director of Virunga]]\n[[File:Mgr Eijk-Heilig Bloed.JPG|thumb|The high Reverend Canon van Outryve d'ydewalle (left)]]\n[[File:Herman Van Rompuy (2010-09-15).jpg|thumb|Herman, Count van Rompuy, President of the European Council]]\n[[File:Guillaume & St\u00e9phanie av Luxemburg.jpg|thumb|[[Stephanie de Lannoy|Stephanie]], Countess of Lannoy]]\n[[File:Dmitry Medvedev with Bertrand de Crombrugghe de Picquendaele.jpg|thumb|The ambassador Bertrand de Crombrugghe de Picquendaele]]\n\nCharacteristically the Belgian nobility is structured and ranked very formally. These ranks are still important in social life and ceremonial life at court.\n\nThe royal house does not belong to the Belgian nobility, it is not of Belgian origin and is considered to be above the [[social class]] that is the nobility.\n\n===Princes in the Belgian nobility===\n\nThe title of [[Prince]] ({{lang-fr|Prince}}, {{lang-nl|Prins}}) is the highest noble title in use in Belgium. They are ranked under the princes of royal blood and members of the royal family. New princes are not created, though they can be recognised or incorporated by the king if their members do prove to have bounds in Belgium and live there. This procedure is very rare and has occurred only with princes that ''{{lang|la|de facto}}'' are Belgian.\n\n====Families====\nMost members of the families listed below have the right to be referred to in Belgian government documents as \"Prince\" or \"Princess\" in combination with their family name. Some titles are not recognised by the Crown, and cannot be used legally, this is the case for the Dukes of Ursel who are the legal heirs to the [[Prince of Arches and Charleville]].\n\n;Former Princes\n* Prince of {{ill|Rheina-Wolbeck|fr}}; former to the House of Loos-Corswarem, at the end given to [[Lannoy family#Lords of Clairvaux|Napol\u00e9on de Lannoy de Clervaux, Prince of Rheina-Wolbeck]].The title was recognised by the Belgian Monarch.<ref>Etat pr\u00e9sent de la noblesse belge,</ref><ref>Almanach de Gotha: annuaire diplomatique et statistique, Volume 106</ref>\n* [[Carl, Prince Bernadotte|Prince Carl of Sweden, Duke of \u00d6sterg\u00f6tland]] (1911\u20132003), brother of [[Astrid of Sweden|Queen Astrid of the Belgians]], having wed Countess Elsa von Rosen in 1937 in defiance of Swedish law, forfeited his Swedish succession rights and royal titles; received from his brother-in-law [[Leopold III of the Belgians|King Leopold III of the Belgians]] the title ''{{lang|fr|Prince Bernadotte}}'' for life in the Belgian nobility on the same date, Count/ess Bernadotte for his male-line descendants.\n* Prince de B\u00e9thune-Hesdigneul, princely title descended by male [[primogeniture]]; extinct in 1976.\n\n;Current Princes\n* Prince [[Czetwerty\u0144ski family|Swiatopelk-Czetwerty\u0144ski]], Prince Michel Czetwertynski, Prince Alexandre Czetwertynski, Prince Tinko Czetwertynski recognised in 2007\n* {{lang|fr|Prince de [[House of Habsburg-Lorraine|Habsbourg-Lorraine]]}}, Archdukes Rudolf (1950) and [[Archduke Carl Christian of Austria|Carl Christian]] of Austria (1954), and their legitimate male-line descendants, were incorporated into Belgium's nobility as ''{{lang|fr|Prince/sse de Habsbourg-Lorraine}}'' in 1978 and 1983, respectively\n* Prince of [[House of Ligne|Ligne]], [[Graf#Reichsgraf, Gef\u00fcrsteter Graf|Imperial Count]] 1549, [[Princes of the Holy Roman Empire|Imperial prince]] 1601, [[mediatization|mediatized]] 1803, 1923 Belgian recognition of title ''{{lang|fr|Prince d'Amblise et d'Epinoy}}'' by male primogeniture\n* Prince de [[Lobkowicz]], [[mediatization|mediatized]] family of [[Czechs|Bohemia]] whose 1624 [[Princes of the Holy Roman Empire|Imperial princely]] title was recognized in Belgium for a member of the family who became a Belgian subject\n* {{lang|fr|Prince de [[House of M\u00e9rode|M\u00e9rode]]}}, [[Graf#Reichsgraf, Gef\u00fcrsteter Graf|Imperial Count]] since 1622; Heads of the house bore the titles Marquis of Westerlo since 1626 and [[Lords of Rubempr\u00e9|Prince of Rubempr\u00e9]] and [[Everberg]] since the 18th century, title of Prince of Grimbergen inherited by primogeniture from {{lang|fr|Marie-Josephe de Mastaing-Oignies}} in 1842; each member is ''{{lang|fr|prince/sse de Merode}}'' since 1929.

The ducal title has never been granted outside the Royal Family in the [[Kingdom of Belgium]].

There are approximately 90 families in Belgium where at least one of the members bears the title of count or countess. An incomplete list of families bearing the title of Count can be found on the [[List of noble families in Belgium#Counts|list of noble families in Belgium]].\n\n===Viscounts in the Belgian nobility===\nThere are approximately 45 families in Belgium where at least one of the members bears the title of [[Viscount]] ({{lang-fr|[[vicomte]]}}, {{lang-nl|[[Burggraaf]]}}). An incomplete list of families bearing the title of Viscount can be found on the [[List of noble families in Belgium#Viscounts|list of noble families in Belgium]].\n\n===Barons in the Belgian nobility===\nMore than 300 individuals bear the title of [[Baron]] or [[Baron]]ess. The title may descend either by masculine primogeniture or to all legitimate descendants in the [[patrilineality|male-line]] of the original title-holder.\n\n===Knights in the Belgian nobility===\nIn Belgium there are roughly 200 [[knight]]s ({{lang-fr|chevalier}}, {{lang-nl|Ridder}}).

Many cadet members of important houses are styled with this title, this happens when the head of the family is styled higher. ''{{lang|fr|\u00c9cuyer}}'' has no French feminine equivalent for daughters or wives; in Dutch the equivalent is ''jonkvrouw''.\n\n==Foreign noble families residing in Belgium==\n[[File:Armes de la famille d'Alcantara.png|thumb|The house of [[Alcantara (surname)|Alcantara]] is from Spanish origin, and belongs to the high nobility]]\n[[File:Armoiries de la famille de Robiano.png|thumb|The House of [[Robiano]], originates from [[Milan]], and belongs to the old nobility of Belgium.]]\nAnother legal concern is that people who have Belgian nationality are forbidden by law to have noble title from another country.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://diplomatie.belgium.be/fr/Services/Protocole/Noblesse/faq|title=FAQ|date=2016-03-23|work=Service public f\u00e9d\u00e9ral Affaires \u00e9trang\u00e8res|access-date=2017-08-15|language=fr}}</ref>\n\nHowever, to have foreign titles recognised is not impossible. It is only possible after formal recognition by the King of the Belgians.\n\nIn addition to the families mentioned above, a number of noble families originated from outside [[Belgium]], but have since obtained Belgian nationality after residing (sometimes for many generations) in [[Belgium]].

Known examples are the [[house of colo|counts of Bornhem]] and the [[Marquess of Assche]] titles inherited by the families of [[Marnix de Sainte-Aldegonde]] and Vander Noot.\n\n=== North of France ===\nUntil 1662 the North part of France belonged to Flanders, under Spanish rule. Titles created before this date are considered to be part of the Flemish nobility.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}} The Picardian and Artesian nobility lost their land to the French Crown, and was incorporated into the French Kingdom. The [[Marquess of Morbecque]] had lost his land after the [[Battle of Cassel (1677)|Battle of Cassel]]. After this periode much former Flemish houses, were bestowed other French titles.\n\n;examples\n* Creation in 1674 by Louis XIV: [[Marquess of Saint-Floris]], title of the Flemish house of Ghistelles.\n* Creation in 1705 by Louis XIV: [[Marquess of Becelaere]], title of the Flemish house of de la Woestyne.\n\n=== Current role of the nobility===\nDuring the Austrian period, the high nobility participated in the government, both political and at the [[Lord Chamberlain of the Archduchess|imperial court of Brussels]]. Since the French Revolution the nobility has not played a social function. However some members of most old families worked in major functions in Belgium.\n\n==Characteristics==\n[[File:Blason Lannoy.jpg|thumb|The House of Lannoy]]\n[[File:Croy-Wappen 093 4.png|thumb|Crest of the House of Croy]]\n[[File:LimburgStirum.jpg|thumb|House of Limburg-Stirum]]\n[[File:Armoiries de la Maison de Lalaing.png|thumb|The house of Lalaing]]\n[[File:Wapen van de familie d'Udekem d'Acoz.svg|thumb|the House of Udekem d\u00b4Acoz]]\n[[File:Kasteel de Merode 1.jpg|thumb|the Castle of the Prince de Merode.]]\n[[File:V\u00eaves CH1aJPG.jpg|thumb|V\u00eaves castle is the residence of Count de Liedekerke Beaufort]]\n[[File:Kasteel van Ooidonk.JPG|thumb|Kasteel van Ooidonk, residence of the House of t'Kint de Roodenbeke]]\n[[File:0 Dr\u00e9hance - Ch\u00e2teau de Walzin (2).JPG|thumb|Walzin Castle, residence of the House of Limburg-Stirum]]\nThe modern Belgian nobility is known to be mostly [[tradition]]alist, and [[monarchism|royalist]]. In the [[Belgium|Kingdom of Belgium]] there were {{As of|2013|lc=on}} approximately 1,300 noble families, with some 20,000 members. The noble lineage of only approximately 400 families dates back to the 17th century or earlier. As Belgium is a democratic [[constitutional monarchy]] there are no legal privileges attached to bearing a noble title or to being a member of the aristocracy. According to article 113 of the constitution, \"The King may confer titles of nobility, without ever having the power to attach privileges to them\".<ref>[http://www.const-court.be/en/basic_text/belgian_constitution.pdf article 113, constitution]</ref>\n\n=== Wealth ===\nMany nobles in Belgium still belong to the [[elite]] of society. They sometimes own and manage companies, or have leading positions in cultural society, business, banking, diplomacy, [[NGO]]s etc. Many of the older families still own (and reside in) important [[castle]]s or [[Rural area|country]] [[Estate (land)|house]]s (see: [[Castles in Belgium]]).\n\nThe fortune of the nobility is impressive: only 11% of the 500 wealthiest families in Belgium are members of the nobility, however: they have more than 56% of this wealth, 79.85 billion euros.<ref>http://www.tijd.be/politiek-economie/belgie-federaal/Rijkste-Belgische-adel-bezit-80-miljard-euro/9870835?ckc=1&ts=1490009474</ref>\nThis is partly caused by the fact that many of the new noble titles are bestowed on wealthy entrepreneurs, like the families of [[B\u00f6el|Bo\u00ebl]], [[Albert Fr\u00e8re|Frere]], [[Colruyt family|Colruyt]], Janssens and [[Ernest Solvay|Solvay]]. Old houses however are in minority and have sold lots of their lands and estates. The [[house of Merode]] has sold during the ages thousands of hectares of their own private lands.<ref>http://www.lecho.be/dossier/noblesse/Les-chateaux-de-la-noblesse/9873497?ckc=1&ts=1490394093</ref> Other houses have still immense lands and grounds, but most houses have lost much of their historic wealth.\n\n=== Surname of the House, and division of the families ===\nLike most European nobility, the family name says much of the origin of the house. Normally the name of the family or House cannot change, however it used to be possible. A famous example was [[Conrad III Schetz]]: he had himself adopted by his aunt and changed his surname, for him and all his descendants from [[Schetz]] to [[Ursel family|van Ursel]].\n\nEvery noble family has its own coat of arms and titles: both are legally protected from copyright. People who do not belong to the house, are forbidden to use the titles or the coat of arms.\n\n== Legal identity ==\nIn Belgium the title forms part of the identity of the noble person and is mentioned on the ID-card. The title is not a part of the name though.<ref>http://diplomatie.belgium.be/nl/Diensten/Protocol/adel/faq</ref>\n\nAssumption of noble titles by those not entitled to any is prohibited and is punishable with a fine of 200 to 1000 euros under article 230 of the Belgian penal code.\n\n== Ennoblement ==\nBelgium is one of the few monarchies in the world in which hereditary [[ennoblement]] still occurs regularly. Hereditary titles are conferred by [[letters patent]], which are in general annually issued by the [[King of the Belgians]]. Noble titles can also be granted for life.\n\nBelgian citizens distinguished in business, politics, science, arts, sports, etc. or for extraordinary service to the kingdom may receive noble status or noble titles.\n\nBy royal decree the monarch can extend, change or upgrade the rank of members of a noble house or change the rank of the whole family.\n\n==Structure of the Belgian nobility==\n[[File:Elizabeth, Comtesse Greffulhe 1905 , by Philip Alexius de Laszlo.jpg|thumb|[[\u00c9lisabeth, Countess Greffulhe]], \"queen\" of Parisian society during the ''[[fin de siecle]]'', was a member of the princely family of [[Chimay]].]]\n[[File:Comtesse Vilain XIIII JLDavid.jpg|thumb|The [[Vilain XIIII|Viscountess Vilain XIIII]], who had great wealth had her portrait painted by [[Jacques-Louis David]].]]\n[[File:Wolfgang-Willem.jpg|thumb|{{Interlanguage link multi|Wolfgang Willem of Ursel|nl|3=Wolfgang Willem van Ursel}}, the third duke of Ursel 1750-1804]]\n[[File:Henri graaf 't Kint de Roodenbeke, voorzitter van de Senaat, 1892-1899.jpg|thumb|Henri t' Kint de Roodenbeke, Senate of Belgium]]\n[[File:General Jacques de Dixmude.jpg|thumb|General [[Alphonse Jacques de Dixmude|Alphonse, 1st Baron Jacques de Dixmude]]]]\n[[File:Joseph de Riquet de Caraman-Chimay (1836-1892) B.jpg|thumb|Joseph de Riquet de Caraman-Chimay]]\n[[File:Emmanuel de M\u00e9rode.jpg|thumb|Prince [[Emmanuel de M\u00e9rode]], Director of Virunga]]\n[[File:Mgr Eijk-Heilig Bloed.JPG|thumb|The high Reverend Canon van Outryve d'ydewalle (left)]]\n[[File:Herman Van Rompuy (2010-09-15).jpg|thumb|Herman, Count van Rompuy, President of the European Council]]\n[[File:Guillaume & St\u00e9phanie av Luxemburg.jpg|thumb|[[Stephanie de Lannoy|Stephanie]], Countess of Lannoy]]\n[[File:Dmitry Medvedev with Bertrand de Crombrugghe de Picquendaele.jpg|thumb|The ambassador Bertrand de Crombrugghe de Picquendaele]]\n\nCharacteristically the Belgian nobility is structured and ranked very formally. These ranks are still important in social life and ceremonial life at court.\n\nThe royal house does not belong to the Belgian nobility, it is not of Belgian origin and is considered to be above the [[social class]] that is the nobility.\n\n===Princes in the Belgian nobility===\n\nThe title of [[Prince]] ({{lang-fr|Prince}}, {{lang-nl|Prins}}) is the highest noble title in use in Belgium. They are ranked under the princes of royal blood and members of the royal family. New princes are not created, though they can be recognised or incorporated by the king if their members do prove to have bounds in Belgium and live there. This procedure is very rare and has occurred only with princes that ''{{lang|la|de facto}}'' are Belgian.\n\n====Families====\nMost members of the families listed below have the right to be referred to in Belgian government documents as \"Prince\" or \"Princess\" in combination with their family name. Some titles are not recognised by the Crown, and cannot be used legally, this is the case for the Dukes of Ursel who are the legal heirs to the [[Prince of Arches and Charleville]].\n\n;Former Princes\n* Prince of {{ill|Rheina-Wolbeck|fr}}; former to the House of Loos-Corswarem, at the end given to [[Lannoy family#Lords of Clairvaux|Napol\u00e9on de Lannoy de Clervaux, Prince of Rheina-Wolbeck]].The title was recognised by the Belgian Monarch.<ref>Etat pr\u00e9sent de la noblesse belge,</ref><ref>Almanach de Gotha: annuaire diplomatique et statistique, Volume 106</ref>\n* [[Carl, Prince Bernadotte|Prince Carl of Sweden, Duke of \u00d6sterg\u00f6tland]] (1911\u20132003), brother of [[Astrid of Sweden|Queen Astrid of the Belgians]], having wed Countess Elsa von Rosen in 1937 in defiance of Swedish law, forfeited his Swedish succession rights and royal titles; received from his brother-in-law [[Leopold III of the Belgians|King Leopold III of the Belgians]] the title ''{{lang|fr|Prince Bernadotte}}'' for life in the Belgian nobility on the same date, Count/ess Bernadotte for his male-line descendants.\n* Prince de B\u00e9thune-Hesdigneul, princely title descended by male [[primogeniture]]; extinct in 1976.\n\n;Current Princes\n* Prince [[Czetwerty\u0144ski family|Swiatopelk-Czetwerty\u0144ski]], Prince Michel Czetwertynski, Prince Alexandre Czetwertynski, Prince Tinko Czetwertynski recognised in 2007\n* {{lang|fr|Prince de [[House of Habsburg-Lorraine|Habsbourg-Lorraine]]}}, Archdukes Rudolf (1950) and [[Archduke Carl Christian of Austria|Carl Christian]] of Austria (1954), and their legitimate male-line descendants, were incorporated into Belgium's nobility as ''{{lang|fr|Prince/sse de Habsbourg-Lorraine}}'' in 1978 and 1983, respectively\n* Prince of [[House of Ligne|Ligne]], [[Graf#Reichsgraf, Gef\u00fcrsteter Graf|Imperial Count]] 1549, [[Princes of the Holy Roman Empire|Imperial prince]] 1601, [[mediatization|mediatized]] 1803, 1923 Belgian recognition of title ''{{lang|fr|Prince d'Amblise et d'Epinoy}}'' by male primogeniture\n* Prince de [[Lobkowicz]], [[mediatization|mediatized]] family of [[Czechs|Bohemia]] whose 1624 [[Princes of the Holy Roman Empire|Imperial princely]] title was recognized in Belgium for a member of the family who became a Belgian subject\n* {{lang|fr|Prince de [[House of M\u00e9rode|M\u00e9rode]]}}, [[Graf#Reichsgraf, Gef\u00fcrsteter Graf|Imperial Count]] since 1622; Heads of the house bore the titles Marquis of Westerlo since 1626 and [[Lords of Rubempr\u00e9|Prince of Rubempr\u00e9]] and [[Everberg]] since the 18th century, title of Prince of Grimbergen inherited by primogeniture from {{lang|fr|Marie-Josephe de Mastaing-Oignies}} in 1842; each member is ''{{lang|fr|prince/sse de Merode}}'' since 1929.

The ducal title has never been granted outside the Royal Family in the [[Kingdom of Belgium]]. The origin of such titles for Belgian families thus pre-dates the current monarchy, having been conferred or recognised by sovereigns of other jurisdictions.\n\n====Examples====\n* the Duke of [[House of Arenberg|Arenberg]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.arenbergcenter.com/ |title=Arenberg Stiftung - Arenberg Foundation - Fondation d'Arenberg - Arenberg Stichting |work=arenbergcenter.com |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070329190116/http://www.arenbergcenter.com/ |archivedate=2007-03-29 |df= }}</ref><ref name=\"gotha\">{{cite book | title=[[Almanach de Gotha]] | publisher=[[Justus Perthes]] | year=1944 | location=Gotha, Germany | pages=170, 190, 248, 354, 372, 390, 466\u2013467, 484, 543}}</ref> princely [[Graf#Reichsgraf, Gef\u00fcrsteter Graf|Imperial count]] 1576, Imperial duke 1644, sovereign 1803-1811, [[mediatization|mediatised]]; although all family members, male and female, are both duke and prince, Belgian recognition of \"prince\" for all members 1953, Belgian duke by primogeniture, 1994\n* the Duke of [[Beaufort-Spontin]],<ref>[http://www.eupedia.com/belgium/high_nobility_of_belgium.shtml#Beaufort-Spontin Ducal and princely families of Belgium: Beaufort-Spontin], [http://www.eupedia.com/about/ Eupedia.com], retrieved 20 December 2009</ref> 1746 Austrian Netherlands title of marquis with rank of prince by primogeniture, duke in 1782 and 1876, [[Graf#Reichsgraf, Gef\u00fcrsteter Graf|Imperial Count]] 1789; family members are Count/ess de Beaufort-Spontin, Head of the House is Duke\n* the Duke of [[Cro\u00ff]], [[Princes of the Holy Roman Empire|Imperial prince]] 1486, 1594 and 1664, French duke 1598 and 1768; each member is ''prince/sse de Cro\u00ff'', while the Head is also the Duke\n* the [[Looz-Corswarem|Duke of Looz-Corswarem]] et de Corswarem-Looz, 1734 Austrian Netherlands dukedom; [[mediatization|mediatised]], other members of this ducal branche are ''prince/sse''; members of a second branch are count/ess of Looz-Corswarem; members of a third branche are \u00e9cuyer de Corswarem\n* the Duke of [[House of Ursel|Ursel]], [[Graf#Reichsgraf, Gef\u00fcrsteter Graf|Imperial Count]] 1638. Only the Head of this family is Duke; any other member is count/ess.\n\n===Marquises in the Belgian nobility===\nMembers of [[List of noble families in Belgium#Marquis|twelve families]] bear today the title of [[Marquess]]. The titles always had origins before the French Revolution, and used to be connected to a physical marquisate. In most of these families, the title descends by masculine [[primogeniture]].\n\n==== Current marquesses ====\n* the [[Marquess of Beauffort]].\n* the [[Marquess of la Bo\u00ebssi\u00e8re-Thiennes]] \n* the [[Marquess of Trazegnies d'Ittre]]\n* the [[Marquess du Parc]]. \n* the [[Marquess Imperiali]]. \n* the [[Marquess of Radigu\u00e8s]].\n* the [[Marquess of Ruffo de Bonneval de la Fare]]: count of Sinopoli di Calabria\n* the Marquess of Spontin, title descends by primogeniture for the Duke of Beaufort Spontin\n* the [[Marquess of Assche]], title of the [[Van der Noot|Count van der Noot]].\n* the [[Marquess of Yve]].\n* the [[Marquess of Westerlo]], one of the titles borne by the head of the [[House of Merode]] who is fully styled; \"Prince de Merode, Marquess of [[Westerlo]], Prince of [[Rubempr\u00e9]] and [[Grimbergen]], Count of the Holy Empire\".\n\n===Counts in the Belgian nobility===\nThe titles [[Count of Hainault]] and [[Count of Flanders]], historically associated with major provinces of what is now Belgium, are used as dynastic titles for members of the [[Belgian Royal Family]].\n\n[[Count]] is the highest-ranked title still granted by the Belgian monarch. There are approximately 90 families in Belgium where at least one of the members bears the title of count or countess. An incomplete list of families bearing the title of Count can be found on the [[List of noble families in Belgium#Counts|list of noble families in Belgium]].\n\n===Viscounts in the Belgian nobility===\nThere are approximately 45 families in Belgium where at least one of the members bears the title of [[Viscount]] ({{lang-fr|[[vicomte]]}}, {{lang-nl|[[Burggraaf]]}}). An incomplete list of families bearing the title of Viscount can be found on the [[List of noble families in Belgium#Viscounts|list of noble families in Belgium]].\n\n===Barons in the Belgian nobility===\nMore than 300 individuals bear the title of [[Baron]] or [[Baron]]ess. The title may descend either by masculine primogeniture or to all legitimate descendants in the [[patrilineality|male-line]] of the original title-holder.\n\n===Knights in the Belgian nobility===\nIn Belgium there are roughly 200 [[knight]]s ({{lang-fr|chevalier}}, {{lang-nl|Ridder}}). The title has no female equivalent.\n\n=== \u00c9cuyer, Jonkheer/Jonkvrouw ===\n{{lang|fr|\u00c9cuyer}}, ''{{lang|nl|[[Jonkheer]]}}'' ([[Dutch language|Dutch]], originally meaning \"young lord\") is the lowest Belgian title recognised by law. Many cadet members of important houses are styled with this title, this happens when the head of the family is styled higher. ''{{lang|fr|\u00c9cuyer}}'' has no French feminine equivalent for daughters or wives; in Dutch the equivalent is ''jonkvrouw''.\n\n==Foreign noble families residing in Belgium==\n[[File:Armes de la famille d'Alcantara.png|thumb|The house of [[Alcantara (surname)|Alcantara]] is from Spanish origin, and belongs to the high nobility]]\n[[File:Armoiries de la famille de Robiano.png|thumb|The House of [[Robiano]], originates from [[Milan]], and belongs to the old nobility of Belgium.]]\nAnother legal concern is that people who have Belgian nationality are forbidden by law to have noble title from another country.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://diplomatie.belgium.be/fr/Services/Protocole/Noblesse/faq|title=FAQ|date=2016-03-23|work=Service public f\u00e9d\u00e9ral Affaires \u00e9trang\u00e8res|access-date=2017-08-15|language=fr}}</ref>\n\nHowever, to have foreign titles recognised is not impossible. It is only possible after formal recognition by the King of the Belgians.\n\nIn addition to the families mentioned above, a number of noble families originated from outside [[Belgium]], but have since obtained Belgian nationality after residing (sometimes for many generations) in [[Belgium]]. Most of these families have come from neighbouring European monarchies (France, the Netherlands, Germany) at various stages of history. These have usually (but not always) asked for equivalent nobility titles within the Kingdom of [[Belgium]], which were typically granted.\n\n==References==\n*[http://www.eupedia.com/belgium/belgian_nobility.shtml Belgian Nobility on eupedia.com]<ref>This list is incomplete.

In the 1950s, she was one of the founders of [[stellar nucleosynthesis]] and was [[first author]] of the influential [[B2FH paper|B<sup>2</sup>FH paper]]. During the 1960s and 70s she worked on galaxy [[rotation curves]] and [[quasars]], discovering the [[most distant astronomical object]] then known. In the 1980s and 90s she helped develop and utilise the [[Faint Object Spectrograph]] on the [[Hubble Space Telescope]]. Burbidge was well known for her work opposing [[discrimination against women]] in astronomy.\n\nBurbidge held several leadership and administrative posts, including [[Director of the Royal Greenwich Observatory]] (1973\u201375), President of the [[American Astronomical Society]] (1976\u201378), and [[President of the American Association for the Advancement of Science]] (1983). Burbidge worked at the [[UCL Observatory|University of London Observatory]], [[Yerkes Observatory]] of the [[University of Chicago]], the [[Cavendish Laboratory]] of the [[University of Cambridge]], the [[California Institute of Technology]], and the [[University of California San Diego]] (UCSD). From 1979 to 1988 she was the first director of the Center for Astronomy and Space Sciences at UCSD, where she worked from 1962 until her retirement.\n\n== Research career ==\nBurbidge studied at [[University College London]] (UCL), where she received an [[undergraduate degree]] in 1939 and a [[PhD]] in 1943.<ref name=snt/> During [[World War Two]], she acted as a [[Property caretaker|caretaker]] at [[University of London Observatory]] (ULO); the [[Blackout (wartime)#World War II|wartime blackout]] made it easier for her to use the observatory's telescopes.<ref name=nyt/> In August 1944, her observations at ULO were twice interrupted by [[V-1 flying bomb]] explosions nearby.<ref name=snt/> She was turned down for a [[postdoctoral fellowship]] from [[Carnegie Observatories]] in 1945 because the job required observing at [[Mount Wilson Observatory]], which was reserved for men only at that time.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rubin|first=Vera C.|title=Bright Galaxies, Dark Matters|date=1997|publisher=[[American Institute of Physics]]|location=Woodbury, N.Y.|isbn=1-56396-231-4}}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://ucsdnews.ucsd.edu/publications/times/TimesV15n4.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050414172039/http://ucsdnews.ucsd.edu/publications/times/TimesV15n4.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=14 April 2005|title=UCSD Times: Vol. 15, No. 4, Feb. 1\u201328, 2001|date=14 April 2005|access-date=6 July 2017}}</ref> Shortly after the war, she taught astronomy at ULO to undergraduate students from across the [[University of London]] system, including [[Arthur C. Clarke]] who was then an undergraduate at [[King's College London]].<ref name=snt/>\n\nIn 1951 she took a position at the [[University of Chicago]]'s [[Yerkes Observatory]], Wisconsin, her first job in the United States. Her research during this period focused on the abundances of [[chemical elements]] in stars. She returned to the UK in 1953, when Margaret and her husband [[Geoffrey Burbidge]] were invited to work with [[William Alfred Fowler]] and [[Fred Hoyle]] at the [[University of Cambridge]].<ref name=snt/> The team combined data on elemental abundances produced by the Burbidges with Hoyle's hypothesis that all chemical elements might be produced in stars by a series of nuclear reactions, and Fowler's laboratory experiments on those reactions.<ref name=snt/> The idea became known as [[stellar nucleosynthesis]]. They published their model in a series of papers, culminating in a [[magnum opus]] in 1957, now known as the [[B2FH paper|B<sup>2</sup>FH paper]] after the initials of Burbidge, Burbidge, Fowler & Hoyle. Margaret Burbidge was the [[first author]] of the paper, which was written while she was pregnant.<ref name=snt/><ref name=rubin_science>{{cite journal|last=Rubin|first=Vera C.|authorlink=Vera Rubin|title=E.

In the 1950s, she was one of the founders of [[stellar nucleosynthesis]] and was [[first author]] of the influential [[B2FH paper|B<sup>2</sup>FH paper]]. During the 1960s and 70s she worked on galaxy [[rotation curves]] and [[quasars]], discovering the [[most distant astronomical object]] then known. In the 1980s and 90s she helped develop and utilise the [[Faint Object Spectrograph]] on the [[Hubble Space Telescope]]. Burbidge was well known for her work opposing [[discrimination against women]] in astronomy.\n\nBurbidge held several leadership and administrative posts, including [[Director of the Royal Greenwich Observatory]] (1973\u201375), President of the [[American Astronomical Society]] (1976\u201378), and [[President of the American Association for the Advancement of Science]] (1983). Burbidge worked at the [[UCL Observatory|University of London Observatory]], [[Yerkes Observatory]] of the [[University of Chicago]], the [[Cavendish Laboratory]] of the [[University of Cambridge]], the [[California Institute of Technology]], and the [[University of California San Diego]] (UCSD). From 1979 to 1988 she was the first director of the Center for Astronomy and Space Sciences at UCSD, where she worked from 1962 until her retirement.\n\n== Research career ==\nBurbidge studied at [[University College London]] (UCL), where she received an [[undergraduate degree]] in 1939 and a [[PhD]] in 1943.<ref name=snt/> During [[World War Two]], she acted as a [[caretaker]] at [[University of London Observatory]] (ULO); the [[Blackout (wartime)#World War II|wartime blackout]] made it easier for her to use the observatory's telescopes.<ref name=nyt/> In August 1944, her observations at ULO were twice interrupted by [[V-1 flying bomb]] explosions nearby.<ref name=snt/> She was turned down for a [[postdoctoral fellowship]] from [[Carnegie Observatories]] in 1945 because the job required observing at [[Mount Wilson Observatory]], which was reserved for men only at that time.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rubin|first=Vera C.|title=Bright Galaxies, Dark Matters|date=1997|publisher=[[American Institute of Physics]]|location=Woodbury, N.Y.|isbn=1-56396-231-4}}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://ucsdnews.ucsd.edu/publications/times/TimesV15n4.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050414172039/http://ucsdnews.ucsd.edu/publications/times/TimesV15n4.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=14 April 2005|title=UCSD Times: Vol. 15, No. 4, Feb. 1\u201328, 2001|date=14 April 2005|access-date=6 July 2017}}</ref> Shortly after the war, she taught astronomy at ULO to undergraduate students from across the [[University of London]] system, including [[Arthur C.

Her research during this period focused on the abundances of [[chemical elements]] in stars. She returned to the UK in 1953, when Margaret and her husband [[Geoffrey Burbidge]] were invited to work with [[William Alfred Fowler]] and [[Fred Hoyle]] at the [[University of Cambridge]].<ref name=snt/> The team combined data on elemental abundances produced by the Burbidges with Hoyle's hypothesis that all chemical elements might be produced in stars by a series of nuclear reactions, and Fowler's laboratory experiments on those reactions.<ref name=snt/> The idea became known as [[stellar nucleosynthesis]]. They published their model in a series of papers, culminating in a [[magnum opus]] in 1957, now known as the [[B2FH paper|B<sup>2</sup>FH paper]] after the initials of Burbidge, Burbidge, Fowler & Hoyle. Margaret Burbidge was the [[first author]] of the paper, which was written while she was pregnant.<ref name=snt/><ref name=rubin_science>{{cite journal|last=Rubin|first=Vera C.|authorlink=Vera Rubin|title=E.

{"title_page": "AltiVec", "text_new": "{{POWER, PowerPC, and Power ISA}}\n'''AltiVec''' is a single-precision [[floating point]] and integer [[SIMD]] [[instruction set]] designed and owned by [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], [[IBM]], and [[Freescale Semiconductor]] (formerly [[Motorola]]'s Semiconductor Products Sector) &mdash; the [[AIM alliance]].  It is implemented on versions of the [[PowerPC]] processor architecture, including Motorola's [[PowerPC G4|G4]], [[IBM]]'s [[PowerPC 970|G5]] and [[POWER6]] processors, and [[P.A. Semi]]'s [[PWRficient]] PA6T.  AltiVec is a [[trademark]] owned solely by Freescale, so the system is also referred to as '''Velocity Engine''' by Apple and '''VMX''' ('''Vector Multimedia Extension''') by IBM and P.A. Semi.\n\nWhile AltiVec refers to an instruction set, the implementations in CPUs produced by IBM and Motorola are separate in terms of logic design. To date, no IBM core has included an AltiVec logic design licensed from Motorola or vice versa.\n\nAltiVec is a standard part of the [[Power ISA#Power ISA v.2.03|Power ISA v.2.03]]<ref name=\"isa203\">{{cite web\n |title     = Power ISA v.2.03\n |publisher = Power.org\n |url       = http://www.power.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/PowerISA_203_Final_Public.pdf\n}}{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> specification. It was never formally a part of the PowerPC architecture until this specification although it used PowerPC instruction formats and syntax and occupied the opcode space expressly allocated for such \npurposes.\n\n==Comparison to x86-64 SSE ==\n\nBoth VMX/AltiVec and [[Streaming SIMD Extensions|SSE]] feature 128-bit vector registers that can represent sixteen 8-bit signed or unsigned chars, eight 16-bit signed or unsigned shorts, four 32-bit ints or four [[IEEE floating-point standard|32-bit]] floating point variables.  Both provide [[CPU cache|cache]]-control instructions intended to minimize [[cache pollution]] when working on streams of data.\n\nThey also exhibit important differences. Unlike [[SSE2]], VMX/AltiVec supports a special [[RGB color model|RGB]] \"[[pixel]]\" data type, but it does not operate on 64-bit double precision floats, and there is no way to move data directly between scalar and [[vector processor|vector]] registers. In keeping with the \"load/store\" model of the PowerPC's [[RISC]] design, the vector registers, like the scalar registers, can only be loaded from and stored to memory. However, VMX/AltiVec provides a much more complete set of \"horizontal\" operations that work across all the elements of a vector; the allowable combinations of data type and operations are much more complete. Thirty-two 128-bit vector registers are provided, compared to eight for SSE and SSE2 (extended to 16 in [[x86-64]]), and most VMX/AltiVec instructions take three register operands compared to only two register/register or register/memory operands on [[IA-32]].\n\nVMX/AltiVec is also unique in its support for a flexible vector [[permute instruction]], in which each byte of a resulting vector value can be taken from any byte of either of two other vectors, parametrized by yet another vector.  This allows for sophisticated manipulations in a single instruction.\n\nRecent versions of the [[GNU Compiler Collection]] (GCC), [[IBM VisualAge]] compiler and other compilers provide [[intrinsic function|intrinsics]] to access VMX/AltiVec instructions directly from [[C (programming language)|C]] and [[C++]] programs. As of version 4, the GCC also includes [[Automatic vectorization|auto-vectorization]] capabilities that attempt to intelligently create VMX/Altivec accelerated binaries without the need for the programmer to use intrinsics directly. The \"vector\" type keyword is introduced to permit the declaration of native vector types, e.g., \"<code>vector unsigned char foo;</code>\" declares a 128-bit vector variable named \"foo\" containing sixteen 8-bit unsigned chars. The full complement of arithmetic and binary operators is defined on vector types so that the normal C expression language can be used to manipulate vector variables. There are also overloaded intrinsic functions such as \"<code>vec_add</code>\" that emit the appropriate op code based on the type of the elements within the vector, and very strong type checking is enforced. In contrast, the Intel-defined data types for IA-32 SIMD registers declare only the size of the vector register (128 or 64 bits) and in the case of a 128-bit register, whether it contains integers or floating point values. The programmer must select the appropriate intrinsic for the data types in use, e.g., \"<code>_mm_add_epi16(x,y)</code>\" for adding two vectors containing eight 16-bit integers.\n\n==Development history==\nThe Power Vector Media Extension (VMX) was developed between 1996 and 1998 by a collaborative project between Apple, IBM, and Motorola. \nApple was the primary customer for Power Vector Media Extension (VMX) until Apple switched to Intel-made, x86-based CPUs on June 6, 2005. They used it to accelerate [[multimedia]] applications such as [[QuickTime]], [[iTunes]] and key parts of Apple's [[Mac OS X]] including in the [[Quartz (graphics layer)|Quartz graphics compositor]].  Other companies such as Adobe used AltiVec to optimize their image-processing programs such as [[Adobe Photoshop]]. Motorola was the first to supply AltiVec enabled processors starting with their G4 line.  AltiVec was also used in some embedded systems for high-performance digital signal processing.\n\nIBM consistently left VMX out of their earlier [[IBM POWER microprocessors|POWER microprocessors]], which were intended for server applications where it was not very useful. The [[POWER6]] microprocessor, introduced in 2007, implements AltiVec. The last desktop microprocessor from IBM, the [[PowerPC 970]] (dubbed the \"G5\" by Apple) also implemented AltiVec with hardware similar to that of the [[PowerPC G4|PowerPC 7400]].\n\nAltiVec is a brandname trademarked by Freescale (previously Motorola) for the standard ''Category:Vector'' part of the [[Power ISA#Power ISA v.2.03|Power ISA v.2.03]]<ref name=\"isa203\" /> specification.  This Category is also known as VMX (used by IBM), and \"Velocity Engine\" (a brand name previously used by Apple).\n\nThe [[Cell microprocessor|Cell]] Broadband Engine, used in (amongst other things) the [[PlayStation 3]], also supports Power Vector Media Extension (VMX) in its PPU, with the SPU ISA being enhanced but architecturally similar.\n\nFreescale is bringing an enhanced version of AltiVec to [[PowerPC e6500|e6500]] based [[QorIQ]] processors.\n\n=== VMX128 ===\nIBM enhanced VMX for use in [[Xenon (processor)|Xenon]] (Xbox 360) and called this enhancement VMX128. The enhancements comprise new routines targeted at gaming (accelerating 3D graphics and game physics)<ref>{{cite web\n |title=The Microsoft Xbox 360 CPU story \n |publisher=IBM\n |url=http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/power/library/pa-fpfxbox/?ca=dgr-lnxw09XBoxDesign \n |url-status=bot: unknown \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080120000613/http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/power/library/pa-fpfxbox/?ca=dgr-lnxw09XBoxDesign \n |archivedate=2008-01-20 \n|date=October 2015\n }}</ref> and a total of 128 registers.

[[POWER7]] is the first Power ISA processor to implement Power ISA v2.06.\n\nNew instructions are introduced by IBM under the Vector Media Extension category for integer operations as part of the VSX extension in Power ISA 2.07.\n\nNew integer vector instructions were introduced by IBM following the VMX encodings as part of the VSX extension in  Power ISA v3.0. Shall be introduced with [[POWER9]] processors.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://sourceware.org/ml/binutils/2015-11/msg00071.html |title = Peter Bergner - &#91;PATCH, COMMITTED&#93; Add full Power ISA 3.0 / POWER9 binutils support}}</ref>\n\n== Issues ==\nIn C++, the standard way of accessing AltiVec support is mutually exclusive with use of the Standard Template Library <code>vector<></code> class template due to the treatment of \"vector\" as a reserved word when the compiler does not implement the context sensitive keyword version of vector.  However, it may be possible to combine them using compiler-specific workarounds; for instance, in GCC one may do <code>#undef vector</code> to remove the <code>vector</code> keyword, and then use the GCC-specific <code>__vector</code> keyword in its place.\n\nAltiVec also lacks 64-bit integer support. Developers who wish to operate on 64-bit data will develop routines from 32-bit components. For example, below are examples of 64-bit <tt>add</tt> and <tt>subtract</tt> in C using a vector with four 32-bit words. The permutes move the carry and borrow bits from columns 1 and 3 to columns 0 and 2 like in school-book math.\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"C\" line='line'>#include <altivec.h>\ntypedef __vector unsigned int uint32x4_p;\n...\n\n/* Performs a+b as if the vector held two 64-bit double words */\nuint32x4_p add64(const uint32x4_p a, const uint32x4_p b)\n{\n    const uint8x16_p cmask = {4,5,6,7, 16,16,16,16, 12,13,14,15, 16,16,16,16};\n    const uint32x4_p zero = {0, 0, 0, 0};\n\n    uint32x4_p cy = vec_addc(vec1, vec2);\n    cy = vec_perm(cy, zero, cmask);\n    return vec_add(vec_add(vec1, vec2), cy);\n}\n\n/* Performs a-b as if the vector held two 64-bit double words */\nuint32x4_p sub64(const uint32x4_p a, const uint32x4_p b)\n{\n    const uint8x16_p bmask = {4,5,6,7, 16,16,16,16, 12,13,14,15, 16,16,16,16};\n    const uint32x4_p amask = {1, 1, 1, 1};\n    const uint32x4_p zero = {0, 0, 0, 0};\n\n    uint32x4_p bw = vec_subc(vec1, vec2);\n    bw = vec_andc(amask, bw);\n    bw = vec_perm(bw, zero, bmask);\n    return vec_sub(vec_sub(vec1, vec2), bw);\n}</syntaxhighlight>\n\nPower ISA 2.07 used in Power8 finally provided the 64-bit double words.

This Category is also known as VMX (used by IBM), and \"Velocity Engine\" (a brand name previously used by Apple).\n\nThe [[Cell microprocessor|Cell]] Broadband Engine, used in (amongst other things) the [[PlayStation 3]], also supports Power Vector Media Extension (VMX) in its PPU, with the SPU ISA being enhanced but architecturally similar.\n\nFreescale is bringing an enhanced version of AltiVec to [[PowerPC e6500|e6500]] based [[QorIQ]] processors.\n\n=== VMX128 ===\nIBM enhanced VMX for use in [[Xenon (processor)|Xenon]] (Xbox 360) and called this enhancement VMX128.

However, it may be possible to combine them using compiler-specific workarounds; for instance, in GCC one may do <code>#undef vector</code> to remove the <code>vector</code> keyword, and then use the GCC-specific <code>__vector</code> keyword in its place.\n\nAltiVec also lacks 64-bit integer support. Developers who wish to operate on 64-bit data will develop routines from 32-bit components. For example, below are examples of 64-bit <tt>add</tt> and <tt>subtract</tt> in C using a vector with four 32-bit words. The permutes move the carry and borrow bits from columns 1 and 3 to columns 0 and 2 like in school-book math.\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"C\" line='line'>#include <altivec.h>\ntypedef __vector unsigned int uint32x4_p;\n...\n\n/* Performs a+b as if the vector held two 64-bit double words */\nuint32x4_p add64(const uint32x4_p a, const uint32x4_p b)\n{\n    const uint8x16_p cmask = {4,5,6,7, 16,16,16,16, 12,13,14,15, 16,16,16,16};\n    const uint32x4_p zero = {0, 0, 0, 0};\n\n    uint32x4_p cy = vec_addc(vec1, vec2);\n    cy = vec_perm(cy, zero, cmask);\n    return vec_add(vec_add(vec1, vec2), cy);\n}\n\n/* Performs a-b as if the vector held two 64-bit double words */\nuint32x4_p sub64(const uint32x4_p a, const uint32x4_p b)\n{\n    const uint8x16_p bmask = {4,5,6,7, 16,16,16,16, 12,13,14,15, 16,16,16,16};\n    const uint32x4_p amask = {1, 1, 1, 1};\n    const uint32x4_p zero = {0, 0, 0, 0};\n\n    uint32x4_p bw = vec_subc(vec1, vec2);\n    bw = vec_andc(amask, bw);\n    bw = vec_perm(bw, zero, bmask);\n    return vec_sub(vec_sub(vec1, vec2), bw);\n}</syntaxhighlight>\n\n== Implementations ==\nThe following processors have AltiVec, VMX or VMX128 included\n\n===Motorola/Freescale===\n*[[PowerPC G4#PowerPC 7400|MPC7400]]\n*[[PowerPC G4#PowerPC 7410|MPC7410]]\n*[[PowerPC G4#PowerPC 7450|MPC7450]]\n*[[PowerPC G4#PowerPC 7445 and 7455|MPC7445/7455]]\n*[[PowerPC G4#PowerPC 7447 and 7457|MPC7447/7447A/7457]]\n*[[PowerPC e600#MPC7448|MPC7448]]\n*[[PowerPC e600#MPC864x|MPC8641/8641D]]\n*[[PowerPC e600#MPC864x|MPC8640/8640D]]\n*[[PowerPC e600#MPC8610|MPC8610]]\n*[[PowerPC e6500|T2081/T2080]]\n*[[PowerPC e6500|T4080/T4160/T4240]]\n*[[PowerPC e6500|B4420/B4860]]\n\n===IBM===\n*[[PowerPC 970]]\n*[[PowerPC 970#PowerPC 970FX|PowerPC 970FX]]\n*[[PowerPC 970#PowerPC 970MP|PowerPC 970MP]]\n*[[Xenon (processor)|Xenon]]\n*[[Cell (microprocessor)|Cell B.E.]]\n*[[Cell (microprocessor)#PowerXCell 8i|PowerXCell 8i]]\n*[[POWER6|POWER6/POWER6+]]\n*[[POWER7|POWER7/POWER7+]]\n*[[POWER8]]\n*[[POWER9]]\n*[[POWER10]]\n\n===P.A.

When discussing or referring to Shakespeare's [[sonnet]]s, it is almost always a reference to the 154 sonnets that were first published all together in a [[quarto]] in 1609.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bl.uk/collection-items/first-edition-of-shakespeares-sonnets-1609|title=First edition of Shakespeare's Sonnets, 1609|website=The British Library|access-date=2019-02-18}}</ref> However, there are six additional sonnets that Shakespeare wrote and included in the plays ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'', ''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]]'' and ''[[Love's Labour's Lost]]''. There is a partial sonnet found in the play ''Edward III''. \n\n==Context==\nShakespeare\u2019s sonnets are considered a continuation of the sonnet tradition that swept through the Renaissance from [[Petrarch]] in 14th-century Italy and was finally introduced in 16th-century England by [[Thomas Wyatt (poet)|Thomas Wyatt]] and was given its rhyming meter and division into quatrains by [[Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey|Henry Howard]]. With few exceptions, Shakespeare\u2019s sonnets observe the stylistic form of the English sonnet\u2014the rhyme scheme, the 14 lines, and the meter. But Shakespeare\u2019s sonnets introduce such significant departures of content that they seem to be rebelling against well-worn 200-year-old traditions.<ref name=\"duncan-jones\">{{cite book |last=Shakespeare |first=William |editor-last=Duncan-Jones |editor-first=Katherine |title=Shakespeare\u2019s Sonnets |publisher=Bloomsbury Arden |date=2010 |isbn=978-1408017975}}</ref>\n\nInstead of expressing worshipful love for an almost goddess-like yet unobtainable female love-object, as Petrarch, [[Dante]], and [[Philip Sidney]] had done, Shakespeare introduces a young man. He also introduces the Dark Lady, who is no goddess. Shakespeare explores themes such as lust, homoeroticism, misogyny, infidelity, and acrimony in ways that may challenge, but which also open new terrain for the sonnet form.<ref name=\"duncan-jones\" />\n\n==The quarto of 1609==\nThe primary source of Shakespeare\u2019s sonnets is a quarto published in 1609 titled ''Shake-speare\u2019s Sonnets.'' It contains 154 sonnets, which are followed by the long poem \"[[A Lover's Complaint]]\". Thirteen copies of the quarto have survived in fairly good shape from the 1609 edition, which is the only edition; there were no other printings. There is evidence in a note on the title page of one of the extant copies that the great Elizabethan actor [[Edward Alleyn]] bought a copy in June 1609 for one shilling.<ref>Shakespeare, William.  Callaghan, Dympna, editor.  ''Shakespeare\u2019s Sonnets''. John Wiley & Sons, 2008. p. x. {{ISBN|978-0470777510}}.</ref><ref name=\"duncan-jones\" />{{rp|6}}\n\nThe sonnets cover such themes as the passage of time, love, infidelity, jealousy, beauty and mortality. The first 126 are addressed to a young man; the last 28 are either addressed to, or refer to a woman. (Sonnets [[Sonnet 138|138]] and [[Sonnet 144|144]] had previously been published in the 1599 [[miscellany]] ''[[The Passionate Pilgrim]]'').\n\nThe title of the quarto, ''Shakespeare\u2019s Sonnets'', is consistent with the entry in the Stationer Register.  The title appears in upper case lettering on the title page, where it is followed by the phrase \u201cNeuer before Imprinted\u201d.  The title also appears every time the quarto is opened. That the author\u2019s name in a possessive form is part of the title sets it apart from all other sonnet collections of the time, except for one\u2014[[Philip Sidney|Sir Philip Sidney\u2019s]] posthumous 1591 publication that is titled, ''Syr. P.S. his Astrophel and Stella'', which is considered one of Shakespeare\u2019s most important models. Sidney\u2019s title may have inspired Shakespeare, particularly if the \u201cW.H.\u201d of Shakespeare\u2019s dedication is Sidney\u2019s nephew and heir, [[William Herbert, 3rd Earl of Pembroke|William Herbert]]. The idea that the persona referred to as the speaker of the Shakespeare\u2019s sonnets might be Shakespeare himself, is aggressively repudiated by scholars, however, the title of the quarto does seem to encourage that kind of speculation.<ref name=\"duncan-jones\" />{{rp|85}}\n\nThe first 17 poems, traditionally called the [[procreation sonnets]], are addressed to the young man\u2014urging him to marry and have children in order to immortalize his beauty by passing it to the next generation.<ref>[[Stanley Wells]] and Michael Dobson, eds., ''The Oxford Companion to Shakespeare'' [[Oxford University Press]], 2001, p. 439.</ref> Other sonnets express the speaker's love for the young man; brood upon loneliness, death, and the transience of life; seem to criticise the young man for preferring a rival poet; express ambiguous feelings for the speaker's [[The Dark Lady|mistress]]; and pun on the poet's name. The final two sonnets are [[allegory|allegorical]] treatments of Greek [[epigrams]] referring to the \"little love-god\" [[Cupid]].\n\nThe publisher, [[Thomas Thorpe]], entered the book in the [[Stationers' Register]] on 20 May 1609:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bl.uk/shakespeare/articles/shakespeare-sexuality-and-the-sonnets|title=Shakespeare, sexuality and the ''Sonnets''|last=Dautch|first=Aviva|authorlink1=Aviva Dautch|website=[[British Library]]|access-date=20 May 2019|date=30 March 2017}}</ref>\n\n: Tho.

Southampton was also known for his good looks.{{cn|date=May 2019}}\n\nThe following is a list of other possibilities that have been suggested:\n* A simple printing error for Shakespeare's initials, \"W.S.\" or \"W.

''The Complete Sonnets and Poems'' (Oxford UP, 2002), pp. 98, 102\u2013103.</ref>\n* [[Willie Hughes]]. The 18th-century scholar [[Thomas Tyrwhitt]] proposed \"William Hughes\", based on puns on the name in the sonnets (notably [[Sonnet 20]]). This idea is expressed in [[Oscar Wilde]]'s short story \"[[The Portrait of Mr. W. H.]]\", and that the sonnets were written to a young actor who played female roles in Shakespeare's plays.<ref>[[Hyder Edward Rollins]], The Sonnets, New Variorum Shakespeare, vol. 25 II, Lippincott, 1944, pp. 181\u2013184.</ref>\n\n===Form and structure of the sonnets===\n[[File:William Shakespeare - Sonnet XXX - Rapenburg 30, Leiden.JPG|thumb|Sonnet 30 as a [[Wall poems in Leiden|wall poem in Leiden]] ]]\nThe sonnets are almost all constructed of three [[quatrains]] (four-line [[stanzas]]) followed by a final [[couplet]]. The sonnets are composed in [[iambic pentameter]], the [[poetic meter|meter]] used in Shakespeare's plays.\n\nThe [[rhyme]] scheme is ABAB CDCD EFEF GG. Sonnets using this scheme are known as Shakespearean sonnets, or English sonnets, or Elizabethan sonnets. Often, at the beginning of the third quatrain occurs the ''volta'' (\"turn\"), where the mood of the poem shifts, and the poet expresses a turn of thought.<ref>{{cite web|title=Glossary of Poetic Terms|url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/learn/glossary-terms/volta|website=Poetry Foundation|accessdate=12 February 2018}}</ref>\n\nThere are a few exceptions: Sonnets [[Sonnet 99|99]], [[Sonnet 126|126]], and [[Sonnet 145|145]]. Number 99 has fifteen lines. Number 126 consists of six couplets, and two blank lines marked with italic brackets; 145 is in [[iambic tetrameter]]s, not pentameters. In one other variation on the standard structure, found for example in [[sonnet 29]], the rhyme scheme is changed by repeating the second (B) rhyme of quatrain one as the second (F) rhyme of quatrain three.\n\nApart from rhyme, and considering only the arrangement of ideas, and the placement of the volta, a number of sonnets maintain the two-part organization of the Italian sonnet.  In that case the term \"octave\" and \"sestet\" are commonly used to refer to the sonnet\u2019s first eight lines followed by the remaining six lines. There are other line-groupings as well, as Shakespeare finds inventive ways with the content of the fourteen line poems.<ref>Vendler, Helen. ''The Art of Shakespeare\u2019s Sonnets''.  Harvard University Press, 1999. {{ISBN|978-0674637122}} p. 50</ref>\n\n===Characters of the sonnets===\nWhen analysed as characters, the subjects of the sonnets are usually referred to as the Fair Youth, the Rival Poet, and the Dark Lady. The speaker expresses admiration for the Fair Youth's beauty, and\u2014if reading the sonnets in chronological order as published\u2014later has an affair with the Dark Lady, then so does the Fair Youth. Current linguistic analysis and historical evidence suggests, however, that the sonnets to the Dark Lady were composed first (around 1591\u201395), the procreation sonnets next, and the later sonnets to the Fair Youth last (1597\u20131603). It is not known whether the poems and their characters are fiction or autobiographical; scholars who find the sonnets to be autobiographical have attempted to identify the characters with historical individuals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.interlitq.org/issue6/donald_adamson/job.php |title=The International Literary Quarterly |publisher=Interlitq.org |date= |accessdate=2014-04-02}}</ref>\n\n====Fair Youth====<!-- This section is linked from William Shakespeare and from Oxfordian theory-->\nThe \"Fair Youth\" is the unnamed young man addressed by the devoted poet in the greatest sequence of the sonnets ([[Sonnet 1|1]]\u2013[[Sonnet 126|126]]). The young man is handsome, self-centered, universally admired and much sought after. The sequence begins with the poet urging the young man to marry and father children (sonnets 1\u201317). It continues with the friendship developing with the poet\u2019s loving admiration, which at times is homoerotic in nature. Then comes a set of betrayals by the young man, as he is seduced by the Dark Lady, and they maintain a liaison (sonnets 133, 134 & 144), all of which the poet struggles to abide. It concludes with the poet\u2019s own act of betrayal, resulting in his independence from the fair youth (sonnet 152).<ref>Hammond. ''The Reader and the Young Man Sonnets''.

One popular theory is that he was [[Henry Wriothesley, 3rd Earl of Southampton|Henry Wriothesley]], the 3rd Earl of Southampton, this is based in part on the idea that his physical features, age, and personality might fairly match the young man in the sonnets.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Shakespeare's Sonnets|last=Sarker|first=Sunil|publisher=Atlantic Publishers & Distributors|year=2006|isbn=8171567258|location=New Delhi|pages=87, 89}}</ref> He was both an admirer and patron of Shakespeare and was considered one of the most prominent nobles of the period.<ref>{{Cite book|title=William Stanley as Shakespeare: Evidence of Authorship by the Sixth Earl of Derby|last=Rollett|first=John|publisher=McFarland & Company, Inc., Publishers|year=2015|isbn=978-0786496600|location=Jefferson, NC|pages=108}}</ref> It is also noted that Shakespeare\u2019s 1593 poem ''[[Venus and Adonis (Shakespeare poem)|Venus and Adonis]]'' is dedicated to Southampton, and in that poem a young man, Adonis, is encouraged by the goddess of love, Venus, to beget a child, which is a theme in the sonnets.

The Dark Lady suddenly appears (Sonnet 127), and she and the speaker of the sonnets, the poet, are in a sexual relationship. She is not aristocratic, young, beautiful, intelligent or chaste. Her complexion is muddy, her breath \u201creeks\u201d, and she is ungainly when she walks.

The sonnets most commonly identified as the Rival Poet group exist within the Fair Youth sequence in sonnets [[Sonnet 78|78]]\u2013[[Sonnet 86|86]].<ref name=\"rivalpoetmeres\" />\n\n===\"A Lover\u2019s Complaint\"===\n\"A Lover\u2019s Complaint\" is part two of the quarto published in 1609. It is not written in the sonnet form, but is composed of 47 seven-line stanzas written in [[rhyme royal]]. It is an example of a normal feature of the two-part poetic form, in which the first part expresses the male point of view, and the second part contrasts or complements the first part with the female\u2019s point of view. The first part of the quarto, the 154 sonnets, considers frustrated male desire, and the second part, \"A Lover\u2019s Complaint\", expresses the misery of a woman victimized by male desire.  The earliest Elizabethan example of this two-part structure is Samuel Daniel\u2019s ''Delia \u2026 with the Complaint of Rosamund'' (1592)\u2014a sonnet sequence that tells the story of a woman being threatened by a man of higher rank, followed by the woman\u2019s complaint.  This was imitated by other poets, including Shakespeare with his ''[[Rape of Lucrece]]'', the last lines of which contain Lucrece\u2019s complaint.  Other examples are found in the works of [[Michael Drayton]], [[Thomas Lodge]], [[Richard Barnfield]], and others.<ref>Roche, Thomas P. ''Petrarch and the English Sonnet Sequences''. AMS Press. New York 1989. {{ISBN|978-0404622886}}. p. 343</ref>\n\nThe young man of the sonnets and the young man of \u201cA Lover\u2019s Complaint\u201d provide a thematic link between the two parts.  In each part the young man is handsome, wealthy and promiscuous, unreliable and admired by all.<ref name=\"duncan-jones\" />{{rp|89}}\n\nLike the sonnets, \"[[A Lover's Complaint]]\" also has a possessive form in its title, which is followed by its own assertion of the author\u2019s name. This time the possessive word, \"Lover's\", refers to a woman, who becomes the primary \"speaker\" of the work.<ref name=\"duncan-jones\" />{{rp|85}}\n\n====Story of \"A Lover\u2019s Complaint\"====\n\"A Lover\u2019s Complaint\" begins with a young woman weeping at the edge of a river, into which she throws torn-up letters, rings, and other tokens of love. An old man nearby approaches her and asks the reason for her sorrow. She responds by telling him of a former lover who pursued, seduced, and finally abandoned her. She recounts in detail the speech her lover gave to her which seduced her. She concludes her story by conceding that she would fall for the young man's false charms again.\n\n==Dates==\n* 1597 \u2013 Shakespeare\u2019s tragedy, ''Romeo and Juliet'' is published.

This small publication contained some spurious content falsely ascribed to Shakespeare; it also contained four sonnets that can be said to be by Shakespeare: Two of the four appear to be early versions of sonnets that were later published in the 1609 quarto (numbers 138 and 144); the other two were sonnets lifted from Shakespeare\u2019s play ''Love\u2019s Labour's Lost.'' Sonnets 138 and 144 are anything but the sweet sonnets hinted at by Francis Meres\u2019 comment. They are instead harshly frank, ironic and recriminative regarding the relationship of the speaker and the Dark Lady. The two sonnets that were taken from ''Love\u2019s Labour's Lost,'' were, in the context of the play, written by comic characters who were intended to be seen as amateur sonneteers. Jaggard\u2019s piracy sold well\u2014a second printing was quickly ordered\u2014but it, including poetry falsely ascribed to Shakespeare, must have been a disappointment to Shakespeare\u2019s readers.<ref>Duncan-Jones, Katherine; Woudhuysen, H.

The contents include a collection of 154 sonnets followed by the poem \u201cA Lover's Complaint\u201d. This publication was greeted with near silence in the documentary record, especially when compared with the lively reception that followed the publication of ''Venus and Adonis''.\n* 1612 \u2013 Jaggard issues an expanded edition of his piratical anthology, ''The Passionate Pilgrim'', which had been published in 1599. Thomas Heywood protests this piracy in his ''Apology for Actors'' (1612), writing that Shakespeare was \"much offended\" with Jaggard for making \"so bold with his name.\" Jaggard withdraws the attribution to Shakespeare from unsold copies of the 1612 edition.\n* 1640 \u2013 The publisher [[John Benson (publisher)|John Benson]] publishes an anthology of poems; some are by Shakespeare, and about 30 are not, but all are ascribed to Shakespeare. It is titled \u2033Poems: Written by Wil. Shakespeare Gent\u201d.  Benson is even more wildly piratical than Jaggard. Benson draws on ''The Passionate Pilgrim'' and other sources, including ''Shakespeare\u2019s Sonnets'' (1609), which he rewrites and rearranges. Benson imperfectly rewrites the sonnets to make them appear to be addressing a woman\u2014the pronoun \"he\" is often replaced by \"she\". This edition is unfortunately influential and resulted in confusing and confounding various critical understanding and response for more than a century. Deliberate mis-gendering is also a feature of 17th-century commonplace books which include Sonnet 2, the most popular sonnet to appear in such collections. In Margaret Bellasys\u2019 commonplace book the poem appears with the non-gendered title, \u2018Spes Altera\u2019. In IA\u2019s commonplace book, the gender of the addressee is explicitly changed with the title, \u2018To one that would die a mayd\u2019. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bl.uk/shakespeare/articles/shakespeare-sexuality-and-the-sonnets|title=Shakespeare, sexuality and the Sonnets|last=Dautch, Aviva|first=|date=|website=The British Library|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-09-13}}</ref>\n*1780 \u2013 [[Edmond Malone]], in his two volume supplement to the 1778 Johnson-Stevens edition of the plays, finally instates the 1609 quarto edition of ''Shakespeare\u2019s Sonnets'' as the sole authoritative text.<ref>Schoenfeldt, Michael Carl.

When discussing or referring to Shakespeare's [[sonnet]]s, it is almost always a reference to the 154 sonnets that were first published all together in a [[quarto]] in 1609.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bl.uk/collection-items/first-edition-of-shakespeares-sonnets-1609|title=First edition of Shakespeare's Sonnets, 1609|website=The British Library|access-date=2019-02-18}}</ref> However, there are six additional sonnets that Shakespeare wrote and included in the plays ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'', ''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]]'' and ''[[Love's Labour's Lost]]''. There is a partial sonnet found in the play ''Edward III''. \n\n==Context==\nShakespeare\u2019s sonnets are considered a continuation of the sonnet tradition that swept through the Renaissance from [[Petrarch]] in 14th-century Italy and was finally introduced in 16th-century England by [[Thomas Wyatt (poet)|Thomas Wyatt]] and was given its rhyming meter and division into quatrains by [[Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey|Henry Howard]]. With few exceptions, Shakespeare\u2019s sonnets observe the stylistic form of the English sonnet\u2014the rhyme scheme, the 14 lines, and the meter. But Shakespeare\u2019s sonnets introduce such significant departures of content that they seem to be rebelling against well-worn 200-year-old traditions.<ref name=\"duncan-jones\">{{cite book |last=Shakespeare |first=William |editor-last=Duncan-Jones |editor-first=Katherine |title=Shakespeare\u2019s Sonnets |publisher=Bloomsbury Arden |date=2010 |isbn=978-1408017975}}</ref>\n\nInstead of expressing worshipful love for an almost goddess-like yet unobtainable female love-object, as Petrarch, [[Dante]], and [[Philip Sidney]] had done, Shakespeare introduces a young man. He also introduces the Dark Lady, who is no goddess. Shakespeare explores themes such as lust, homoeroticism, misogyny, infidelity, and acrimony in ways that may challenge, but which also open new terrain for the sonnet form.<ref name=\"duncan-jones\" />\n\n==The quarto of 1609==\nThe primary source of Shakespeare\u2019s sonnets is a quarto published in 1609 titled ''Shake-speare\u2019s Sonnets.'' It contains 154 sonnets, which are followed by the long poem \"[[A Lover's Complaint]]\". Thirteen copies of the quarto have survived in fairly good shape from the 1609 edition, which is the only edition; there were no other printings. There is evidence in a note on the title page of one of the extant copies that the great Elizabethan actor [[Edward Alleyn]] bought a copy in June 1609 for one shilling.<ref>Shakespeare, William.  Callaghan, Dympna, editor.  ''Shakespeare\u2019s Sonnets''. John Wiley & Sons, 2008. p. x. {{ISBN|978-0470777510}}.</ref><ref name=\"duncan-jones\" />{{rp|6}}\n\nThe sonnets cover such themes as the passage of time, love, infidelity, jealousy, beauty and mortality. The first 126 are addressed to a young man; the last 28 are either addressed to, or refer to a woman. (Sonnets [[Sonnet 138|138]] and [[Sonnet 144|144]] had previously been published in the 1599 [[miscellany]] ''[[The Passionate Pilgrim]]'').\n\nThe title of the quarto, ''Shakespeare\u2019s Sonnets'', is consistent with the entry in the Stationer Register.  The title appears in upper case lettering on the title page, where it is followed by the phrase \u201cNeuer before Imprinted\u201d.  The title also appears every time the quarto is opened. That the author\u2019s name in a possessive form is part of the title sets it apart from all other sonnet collections of the time, except for one\u2014[[Philip Sidney|Sir Philip Sidney\u2019s]] posthumous 1591 publication that is titled, ''Syr. P.S. his Astrophel and Stella'', which is considered one of Shakespeare\u2019s most important models. Sidney\u2019s title may have inspired Shakespeare, particularly if the \u201cW.H.\u201d of Shakespeare\u2019s dedication is Sidney\u2019s nephew and heir, [[William Herbert, 3rd Earl of Pembroke|William Herbert]]. The idea that the persona referred to as the speaker of the Shakespeare\u2019s sonnets might be Shakespeare himself, is aggressively repudiated by scholars, however, the title of the quarto does seem to encourage that kind of speculation.<ref name=\"duncan-jones\" />{{rp|85}}\n\nThe first 17 poems, traditionally called the [[procreation sonnets]], are addressed to the young man\u2014urging him to marry and have children in order to immortalize his beauty by passing it to the next generation.<ref>[[Stanley Wells]] and Michael Dobson, eds., ''The Oxford Companion to Shakespeare'' [[Oxford University Press]], 2001, p. 439.</ref> Other sonnets express the speaker's love for the young man; brood upon loneliness, death, and the transience of life; seem to criticise the young man for preferring a rival poet; express ambiguous feelings for the speaker's [[The Dark Lady|mistress]]; and pun on the poet's name. The final two sonnets are [[allegory|allegorical]] treatments of Greek [[epigrams]] referring to the \"little love-god\" [[Cupid]].\n\nThe publisher, [[Thomas Thorpe]], entered the book in the [[Stationers' Register]] on 20 May 1609:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bl.uk/shakespeare/articles/shakespeare-sexuality-and-the-sonnets|title=Shakespeare, sexuality and the ''Sonnets''|last=Dautch|first=Aviva|authorlink1=Aviva Dautch|website=[[British Library]]|access-date=20 May 2019|date=30 March 2017}}</ref>\n\n: Tho.

''The Complete Sonnets and Poems'' (Oxford UP, 2002), pp. 98, 102\u2013103.</ref>\n* [[Willie Hughes]]. The 18th-century scholar [[Thomas Tyrwhitt]] proposed \"William Hughes\", based on puns on the name in the sonnets (notably [[Sonnet 20]]). This idea is expressed in [[Oscar Wilde]]'s short story \"[[The Portrait of Mr. W. H.]]\", and that the sonnets were written to a young actor who played female roles in Shakespeare's plays.<ref>[[Hyder Edward Rollins]], The Sonnets, New Variorum Shakespeare, vol. 25 II, Lippincott, 1944, pp. 181\u2013184.</ref>\n\n===Form and structure of the sonnets===\n[[File:William Shakespeare - Sonnet XXX - Rapenburg 30, Leiden.JPG|thumb|Sonnet 30 as a [[Wall poems in Leiden|wall poem in Leiden]] ]]\nThe sonnets are almost all constructed of three [[quatrains]] (four-line [[stanzas]]) followed by a final [[couplet]]. The sonnets are composed in [[iambic pentameter]], the [[poetic meter|meter]] used in Shakespeare's plays.\n\nThe [[rhyme]] scheme is ABAB CDCD EFEF GG. Sonnets using this scheme are known as Shakespearean sonnets, or English sonnets, or Elizabethan sonnets. Often, at the beginning of the third quatrain occurs the ''volta'' (\"turn\"), where the mood of the poem shifts, and the poet expresses a turn of thought.<ref>{{cite web|title=Glossary of Poetic Terms|url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/learn/glossary-terms/volta|website=Poetry Foundation|accessdate=12 February 2018}}</ref>\n\nThere are a few exceptions: Sonnets [[Sonnet 99|99]], [[Sonnet 126|126]], and [[Sonnet 145|145]]. Number 99 has fifteen lines. Number 126 consists of six couplets, and two blank lines marked with italic brackets; 145 is in [[iambic tetrameter]]s, not pentameters. In one other variation on the standard structure, found for example in [[sonnet 29]], the rhyme scheme is changed by repeating the second (B) rhyme of quatrain one as the second (F) rhyme of quatrain three.\n\nApart from rhyme, and considering only the arrangement of ideas, and the placement of the volta, a number of sonnets maintain the two-part organization of the Italian sonnet.  In that case the term \"octave\" and \"sestet\" are commonly used to refer to the sonnet\u2019s first eight lines followed by the remaining six lines. There are other line-groupings as well, as Shakespeare finds inventive ways with the content of the fourteen line poems.<ref>Vendler, Helen. ''The Art of Shakespeare\u2019s Sonnets''.  Harvard University Press, 1999. {{ISBN|978-0674637122}} p. 50</ref>\n\n===Characters of the sonnets===\nWhen analysed as characters, the subjects of the sonnets are usually referred to as the Fair Youth, the Rival Poet, and the Dark Lady. The speaker expresses admiration for the Fair Youth's beauty, and\u2014if reading the sonnets in chronological order as published\u2014later has an affair with the Dark Lady, then so does the Fair Youth. Current linguistic analysis and historical evidence suggests, however, that the sonnets to the Dark Lady were composed first (around 1591\u201395), the procreation sonnets next, and the later sonnets to the Fair Youth last (1597\u20131603). It is not known whether the poems and their characters are fiction or autobiographical; scholars who find the sonnets to be autobiographical have attempted to identify the characters with historical individuals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.interlitq.org/issue6/donald_adamson/job.php |title=The International Literary Quarterly |publisher=Interlitq.org |date= |accessdate=2014-04-02}}</ref>\n\n====Fair Youth====<!-- This section is linked from William Shakespeare and from Oxfordian theory-->\nThe \"Fair Youth\" is the unnamed young man addressed by the devoted poet in the greatest sequence of the sonnets ([[Sonnet 1|1]]\u2013[[Sonnet 126|126]]). The young man is handsome, self-centered, universally admired and much sought after. The sequence begins with the poet urging the young man to marry and father children (sonnets 1\u201317). It continues with the friendship developing with the poet\u2019s loving admiration, which at times is homoerotic in nature. Then comes a set of betrayals by the young man, as he is seduced by the Dark Lady, and they maintain a liaison (sonnets 133, 134 & 144), all of which the poet struggles to abide. It concludes with the poet\u2019s own act of betrayal, resulting in his independence from the fair youth (sonnet 152).<ref>Hammond. ''The Reader and the Young Man Sonnets''.

The Dark Lady suddenly appears (Sonnet 127), and she and the speaker of the sonnets, the poet, are in a sexual relationship. She is not aristocratic, young, beautiful, intelligent or chaste. Her complexion is muddy, her breath \u201creeks\u201d, and she is ungainly when she walks. The relationship has a strong parallel with Touchstone\u2019s pursuit of Audrey in ''As You Like It''.<ref>Shakespeare, William.  ''As You Like It''.

She is celebrated in cocky terms that would be offensive to her, not that she would be able to read or understand what's said.  Soon the speaker rebukes her for enslaving his fair friend (sonnet 130).

If Shakespeare\u2019s patron and friend was Pembroke, Shakespeare was not the only poet that praised his beauty; Francis Davison did in a sonnet that is the preface to Davison's quarto ''A Poetical Rhapsody'' (1608), which was published just before Shakespeare\u2019s Sonnets.<ref>Brown, Henry.

The sonnets most commonly identified as the Rival Poet group exist within the Fair Youth sequence in sonnets [[Sonnet 78|78]]\u2013[[Sonnet 86|86]].<ref name=\"rivalpoetmeres\" />\n\n===\"A Lover\u2019s Complaint\"===\n\"A Lover\u2019s Complaint\" is part two of the quarto published in 1609. It is not written in the sonnet form, but is composed of 47 seven-line stanzas written in [[rhyme royal]]. It is an example of a normal feature of the two-part poetic form, in which the first part expresses the male point of view, and the second part contrasts or complements the first part with the female\u2019s point of view. The first part of the quarto, the 154 sonnets, considers frustrated male desire, and the second part, \"A Lover\u2019s Complaint\", expresses the misery of a woman victimized by male desire.  The earliest Elizabethan example of this two-part structure is Samuel Daniel\u2019s ''Delia \u2026 with the Complaint of Rosamund'' (1592)\u2014a sonnet sequence that tells the story of a woman being threatened by a man of higher rank, followed by the woman\u2019s complaint.  This was imitated by other poets, including Shakespeare with his ''[[Rape of Lucrece]]'', the last lines of which contain Lucrece\u2019s complaint.  Other examples are found in the works of [[Michael Drayton]], [[Thomas Lodge]], [[Richard Barnfield]], and others.<ref>Roche, Thomas P. ''Petrarch and the English Sonnet Sequences''. AMS Press. New York 1989. {{ISBN|978-0404622886}}. p. 343</ref>\n\nThe young man of the sonnets and the young man of \u201cA Lover\u2019s Complaint\u201d provide a thematic link between the two parts.  In each part the young man is handsome, wealthy and promiscuous, unreliable and admired by all.<ref name=\"duncan-jones\" />{{rp|89}}\n\nLike the sonnets, \"[[A Lover's Complaint]]\" also has a possessive form in its title, which is followed by its own assertion of the author\u2019s name. This time the possessive word, \"Lover's\", refers to a woman, who becomes the primary \"speaker\" of the work.<ref name=\"duncan-jones\" />{{rp|85}}\n\n====Story of \"A Lover\u2019s Complaint\"====\n\"A Lover\u2019s Complaint\" begins with a young woman weeping at the edge of a river, into which she throws torn-up letters, rings, and other tokens of love. An old man nearby approaches her and asks the reason for her sorrow. She responds by telling him of a former lover who pursued, seduced, and finally abandoned her. She recounts in detail the speech her lover gave to her which seduced her. She concludes her story by conceding that she would fall for the young man's false charms again.\n\n==Dates==\n* 1597 \u2013 Shakespeare\u2019s tragedy, ''Romeo and Juliet'' is published.  The spoken prologue to the play, and the prologue to Act II are both written in sonnet form, and the first meeting of the star-crossed lovers is written as a sonnet woven into the dialogue.<ref>Shakespeare, William.

This small publication contained some spurious content falsely ascribed to Shakespeare; it also contained four sonnets that can be said to be by Shakespeare: Two of the four appear to be early versions of sonnets that were later published in the 1609 quarto (numbers 138 and 144); the other two were sonnets lifted from Shakespeare\u2019s play ''Love\u2019s Labour's Lost.'' Sonnets 138 and 144 are anything but the sweet sonnets hinted at by Francis Meres\u2019 comment. They are instead harshly frank, ironic and recriminative regarding the relationship of the speaker and the Dark Lady. The two sonnets that were taken from ''Love\u2019s Labour's Lost,'' were, in the context of the play, written by comic characters who were intended to be seen as amateur sonneteers. Jaggard\u2019s piracy sold well\u2014a second printing was quickly ordered\u2014but it, including poetry falsely ascribed to Shakespeare, must have been a disappointment to Shakespeare\u2019s readers.<ref>Duncan-Jones, Katherine; Woudhuysen, H.

The contents include a collection of 154 sonnets followed by the poem \u201cA Lover's Complaint\u201d. This publication was greeted with near silence in the documentary record, especially when compared with the lively reception that followed the publication of ''Venus and Adonis''.\n* 1612 \u2013 Jaggard issues an expanded edition of his piratical anthology, ''The Passionate Pilgrim'', which had been published in 1599. Thomas Heywood protests this piracy in his ''Apology for Actors'' (1612), writing that Shakespeare was \"much offended\" with Jaggard for making \"so bold with his name.\" Jaggard withdraws the attribution to Shakespeare from unsold copies of the 1612 edition.\n* 1640 \u2013 The publisher [[John Benson (publisher)|John Benson]] publishes an anthology of poems; some are by Shakespeare, and about 30 are not, but all are ascribed to Shakespeare. It is titled \u2033Poems: Written by Wil. Shakespeare Gent\u201d.  Benson is even more wildly piratical than Jaggard. Benson draws on ''The Passionate Pilgrim'' and other sources, including ''Shakespeare\u2019s Sonnets'' (1609), which he rewrites and rearranges. Benson imperfectly rewrites the sonnets to make them appear to be addressing a woman\u2014the pronoun \"he\" is often replaced by \"she\". This edition is unfortunately influential and resulted in confusing and confounding various critical understanding and response for more than a century. Deliberate mis-gendering is also a feature of 17th-century commonplace books which include Sonnet 2, the most popular sonnet to appear in such collections. In Margaret Bellasys\u2019 commonplace book the poem appears with the non-gendered title, \u2018Spes Altera\u2019. In IA\u2019s commonplace book, the gender of the addressee is explicitly changed with the title, \u2018To one that would die a mayd\u2019. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bl.uk/shakespeare/articles/shakespeare-sexuality-and-the-sonnets|title=Shakespeare, sexuality and the Sonnets|last=Dautch, Aviva|first=|date=|website=The British Library|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-09-13}}</ref>\n*1780 \u2013 [[Edmond Malone]], in his two volume supplement to the 1778 Johnson-Stevens edition of the plays, finally instates the 1609 quarto edition of ''Shakespeare\u2019s Sonnets'' as the sole authoritative text.<ref>Schoenfeldt, Michael Carl.
