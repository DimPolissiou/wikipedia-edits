The racial makeup of the CDP was 89.2% [[White (U.S. Census)|White]], 2.2% [[African American (U.S. Census)|African American]], 0.1% [[Native American (U.S. Census)|Native American]], 5.9% [[Asian (U.S. Census)|Asian]], 0.0% [[Pacific Islander (U.S. Census)|Pacific Islander]], 1.3% from [[Race (United States Census)|other races]], and 1.3% from two or more races. [[Hispanic (U.S. Census)|Hispanic]] or [[Latino (U.S. Census)|Latino]] of any race were 7.1% of the population.\n\nThere were 7,333 households, out of which 36% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 65.1% were [[Marriage|married couples]] living together, 8.4% had a female householder with no husband present, and 23.3% were non-families. 19.1% of all households were made up of individuals and 7.7% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.81 and the average family size was 3.25.\n\nThe median age was 42.5 years.

As the park has aged, so too have its occupying companies, many of which have closed their facilities. One example, are the facilities of Reuters Group prior to its 2008 merger with Thomson Corporation. Afterwards, Reuters offices, comprising three data centers, were vacated and relocated to [[Times Square]] in New York City, the UK, and other Thomson complexes. The three empty data centers still are under long-term leases, but as is visibly apparent when driving through the industrial park, many corporations have either closed or vacated for newer locales.\n\nStarting in 1936 the current site of the Hauppauge Industrial Park housed a radio communication facility operated first by Mackay Radio and Telegraph Company (owned by [[Clarence Mackay]]) and later by [[ITT Corporation]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Mackay Radio|url=http://www.mackayhistory.com/Mackay_Radio_1.html|publisher=Bill McLaughlin|date=2007-02-02|accessdate=2017-02-17|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170217223938/http://www.mackayhistory.com/Mackay_Radio_1.html|archivedate=2017-02-17}}</ref> The radio facility, which specialized in transmissions to and from Europe, South America, and ships at sea, closed in 1986 but is memorialized on-site by Wireless Blvd.\n\n==Economy==\nRoyal Apparel's headquarters are located here since 1992, producing American-made apparel here amongst several other east-coast locations.

Hauppauge is known for the underground water springs and high underground water table.\n\n==History==\nAccording to the historian [[Simeon Wood]], the first house in greater Hauppauge dates to 1731, being located on what would be the Arbuckle Estate, and later the southeast corner of the Hauppauge Industrial Park, near the intersection of [[Motor Parkway]] and Old Willets Path.<ref name=\"marrhist\">Marr, Jack J., ''A History of Hauppauge'', Hauppauge, NY: Jack Marr Publishing Company, 1981.</ref> The settlement of Hauppauge proper commenced with the family of Thomas Wheeler prior to 1753, at the present-day location of the Wave gas station between Townline and Wheeler Road.<ref name=\"marrhist\" /> The locale would take the Wheelers' name as its own until the 1860s when the name Hauppauge was restored.<ref name=\"marrhist\" /> On March 13, 1806, \"a meeting of the male members of the Methodist Society of the 'Haupogues' was convened at the School House agreeable to public notice for the express purpose of Incorporating and Electing Trustees for said Society.\" The first trustees elected at the meeting presided by Timothy Wheeler and Issac Wheeler were Issac Nichols, Elkanah Wheeler, George Wheeler, and Samuel Brush.

Church at Hauppauge from year 1806 to the year 1886 inclusive.</ref> In 1812 the Hauppauge Methodist Church that stands today was constructed on land donated by the Wheeler family.\n\nHauppauge gained significance as a [[waypoint]] on the King's Highway, laid out by the colonial legislature of New York in 1702.<ref name=\"marrhist\" /> The present-day right of way departs westward from [[New York State Route 111|Route 111]] as Conklin's Road or Half Mile Road, passing St.&nbsp;Thomas More [[Roman Catholic]] Church before terminating at the border between [[Smithtown, New York|Smithtown]] and [[Islip, New York|Islip]].

The [[population density]] was 1,900.0 per square mile (740.0/km\u00b2). There were 7,566 housing units at an average density of 700.6/sq&nbsp;mi (270.4/km\u00b2). The racial makeup of the CDP was 89.2% [[White (U.S. Census)|White]], 2.2% [[African American (U.S. Census)|African American]], 0.1% [[Native American (U.S. Census)|Native American]], 5.9% [[Asian (U.S. Census)|Asian]], 0.0% [[Pacific Islander (U.S. Census)|Pacific Islander]], 1.3% from [[Race (United States Census)|other races]], and 1.3% from two or more races. [[Hispanic (U.S. Census)|Hispanic]] or [[Latino (U.S. Census)|Latino]] of any race were 7.1% of the population.\n\nThere were 7,333 households, out of which 36% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 65.1% were [[Marriage|married couples]] living together, 8.4% had a female householder with no husband present, and 23.3% were non-families. 19.1% of all households were made up of individuals and 7.7% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.81 and the average family size was 3.25.\n\nThe median age was 42.5 years. For every 100 females, there were 96.4 males.\n\nAccording to a 2015 estimate,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://factfinder.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/ACS/15_5YR/DP03/1600000US3632732|title=American FactFinder - Results|first=U.S. Census|last=Bureau|date=|website=factfinder.census.gov|accessdate=26 April 2018|archive-url=https://archive.today/20200213114220/https://factfinder.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/ACS/15_5YR/DP03/1600000US3632732|archive-date=13 February 2020|url-status=dead}}</ref> the median income for a household in the CDP was $105,305, and the median income for a family was $120,044.

About 2.2% of families and 3.5% of the population were below the [[poverty line]], including 4.9% of those under age 18 and 1.6% of those age 65 or over.\n\n==Hauppauge Industrial Park==\nThe Hauppauge Industrial Park, located at the edge of the hamlet, is the largest on [[Long Island]], and by some accounts the second largest in the nation. The park had more than 1,000 companies and employs over 55,000 people.<ref>{{cite web|title=Hauppauge Industrial Park|url=https://www.hia-li.org/about-hia-li/hauppauge-industrial-park/|publisher=HIA-LI|accessdate=2017-02-17|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170218070226/https://www.hia-li.org/about-hia-li/hauppauge-industrial-park/|archivedate=2017-02-18}}</ref> The companies in the industrial park provide tax revenue to the Hauppauge [[school district]]'s budget. As the park has aged, so too have its occupying companies, many of which have closed their facilities. One example, are the facilities of Reuters Group prior to its 2008 merger with Thomson Corporation. Afterwards, Reuters offices, comprising three data centers, were vacated and relocated to [[Times Square]] in New York City, the UK, and other Thomson complexes. The three empty data centers still are under long-term leases, but as is visibly apparent when driving through the industrial park, many corporations have either closed or vacated for newer locales.\n\nStarting in 1936 the current site of the Hauppauge Industrial Park housed a radio communication facility operated first by Mackay Radio and Telegraph Company (owned by [[Clarence Mackay]]) and later by [[ITT Corporation]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Mackay Radio|url=http://www.mackayhistory.com/Mackay_Radio_1.html|publisher=Bill McLaughlin|date=2007-02-02|accessdate=2017-02-17|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170217223938/http://www.mackayhistory.com/Mackay_Radio_1.html|archivedate=2017-02-17}}</ref> The radio facility, which specialized in transmissions to and from Europe, South America, and ships at sea, closed in 1986 but is memorialized on-site by Wireless Blvd.\n\n==Economy==\nRoyal Apparel\u2019s headquarters are located here since 1992, producing American-made apparel here amongst several other east-coast locations. In May 2000, [[Skidmore, Owings & Merrill]] opened an office in Hauppauge. The {{convert|2500|sqft|sqm|adj=on}} office is located on the second floor of the 1300 [[New York State Route 454|Veterans Memorial Highway]] building. Carl Galioto, the head of the company's technical division, stated that it opened the office because it had difficulty hiring [[New York City]]-area recruits.
