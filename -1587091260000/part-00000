Cooliekkara Kuppam, a [[slum]] area in [[Chennai]]. He is one such responsible youth who focuses on working for the betterment of his fellow beings, and he works hard for the same. Arivu starts Kuppam [[FM broadcasting|FM]] 90.8, a local radio channel with the help of the area gangster, Kasi ([[Prakash Raj]]). In reality, Arivu tries to free the people of the area from the atrocities of Kasi, who is deliberately preventing them from becoming independent, so that he may continue to dominate the area.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.filmibeat.com/tamil/movies/velaikkaran-2017-velaikaran/story.html|title=Velaikkaran (Velaikaran) Preview, Velaikkaran Story & Synopsis, Velaikkaran Tamil Movie|website=FilmiBeat|language=en|access-date=2019-05-15}}</ref> Arivu succeeds in turning the people of the area against Kasi, thus destroying his support.\n\nLater, Arivu joins a leading [[FMCG]] company called Saffron and joins its sales department under Stella Bruce ([[Thambi Ramaiah]]). He manages to bring his friend Bhagya ([[Vijay Vasanth]]) out of Kasi's gang and gets him a job in Saffron. He meets Aadhi ([[Fahadh Faasil]]), Saffron's brand manager, who teaches him how to progress by doing smart work, and Arivu considers him as his inspiration. On the night of April 1, Kasi and his gang attack and stab Bhagya in Saffron's warehouse, whereupon he dies in Arivu's hands. Arivu, filled with rage, tries to attack Kasi, but Kasi's rival Doss ([[Sharath Lohitashwa]]) attacks and  stabs Kasi in retaliation for their previous encounter. Arivu admonishes Kasi for being a paid henchman. Kasi reveals to Arivu that he killed Bhagya on a contract given by Jayaram ([[Anish Kuruvilla]]), the President of Saffron. The motive was that Bhagya tried to help Kasthuri ([[Sneha]]), who filed a case claiming Saffron's products to be [[adulterant|adulterated]], due to which she lost her son. Arivu is addressed by Kasi as being a worse hitman than he himself is. Arivu then saves Kasi, who tells Arivu that all products manufactured by Saffron are adulterated. Arivu takes up a mission to fight such malpractices not only in Saffron, but in all the other five major food companies, including the one owned by Madhav Kurup ([[Mahesh Manjrekar]]). Arivu shares all of his plans with Aadhi. Meanwhile, is revealed that Aadhi is actually Adhiban Madhav, Madhav's son. He joined Saffron to know their trade secrets and merge the company with his father's company.\n\nArivu manages to convince his company's staff to manufacture products as per government regulations for two days. At the same time, he convinces the staff of the other companies to wear a kerchief on their dresses for the next two days, thus tricking the owners into believing that their workers have turned against them. However, Aadhi manages to foil Arivu's plan and [[coercion|coerces]] the other owners to write over the major shares of their company to Madhav, thus making him the deciding authority of all their companies. Aadhi manages to turn the employees against Arivu by tricking them into believing that Arivu worked as a spy for Madhav. Stella Bruce then slaps and humiliates Arivu, while Aadhi pretends to defend Arivu, claiming that he is innocent and that it is the new president who conspired all these. After this, Arivu reveals to Aadhi that Stella Bruce was his ally, and he now knows that Aadhi is the true traitor. Aadhi then burns down the godown containing the unadulterated products and reveals to Arivu that he is Madhav's son and will be the next CEO of the company. He also convinces the staff through his clever tactics and makes them propose his name as the new CEO, also revealing to Arivu that he will make them manufacture adulterated products without their knowledge, now that he commands their loyalty, support, and trust.\n\nArivu goes to the [[Radio Mirchi]] radio station on the night before May 1. He reveals that after the fire, one of the injured department heads of Saffron, Karpaga Vinayagam ([[Ramdoss]]), called him into the ambulance and told him that he followed the regulations on the third day too. Arivu learned from the other Saffron team workers - Kennedy ([[Mansoor Ali Khan (actor)|Mansoor Ali Khan]]), Vinoth ([[Kaali Venkat]]), Ansari ([[Aruldoss]]), and Sivaranjani ([[Vinodhini Vaidyanathan]]) - that after manufacturing quality products for two days, they could not bring themselves to manufacture adulterated products on the next day. They confirm they all followed government regulations, thus manufacturing quality products on the next day. Aadhi, now the CEO, hears the workers say that they will rebel against him and depose him if he tries to revert to manufacturing adulterated products. Arivu adds that the loyalty of all the employees in every field should not be wasted by showing it towards unethical employers. Aadhi then vents his frustration about the failure of his plan.\n\nAll the people in the city show their support to Arivu, who celebrates his success with his love interest Mrinalini ([[Nayanthara]]), friends, family, the people of his slum, and the people of the city as the film ends.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Sivakarthikeyan]] as Arivu\n* [[Fahadh Faasil]] as Adhiban Madhav (Aadhi)\n* [[Nayanthara]] as Mrinalini \"Miru\" (voice dubbed by [[Deepa Venkat]])\n* [[Prakash Raj]] as Kasi\n* [[Sneha (actress)|Sneha]] as Kasthuri\n* [[Thambi Ramaiah]] as Stella Bruce\n* [[RJ Balaji]] as Sriram\n* [[Sathish]] as Hari\n* [[Vijay Vasanth]] as Bhagya\n* [[Robo Shankar]] as Chinna Thambi\n* [[Rohini (actress)|Rohini]] as Ponni\n* [[Charle]] as Murugesan\n* [[Ramdoss]] as Karpaga Vinayagam\n* [[Aruldoss]] as Ansari\n* [[Kaali Venkat]] as Vinoth\n* [[Mansoor Ali Khan (actor)|Mansoor Ali Khan]] as Kennedy\n* [[Vinodhini Vaidyanathan]] as Sivaranjani\n* [[Mime Gopi]] as Kishta\n* [[Y.

Cooliekkara Kuppam, a [[slum]] area in [[Chennai]]. He is one such responsible youth who focuses on working for the betterment of his fellow beings, and he works hard for the same. Arivu starts Kuppam [[FM broadcasting|FM]] 90.8, a local radio channel with the help of the area gangster, Kasi ([[Prakash Raj]]). In reality, Arivu tries to free the people of the area from the atrocities of Kasi, who is deliberately preventing them from becoming independent, so that he may continue to dominate the area.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.filmibeat.com/tamil/movies/velaikkaran-2017-velaikaran/story.html|title=Velaikkaran (Velaikaran) Preview, Velaikkaran Story & Synopsis, Velaikkaran Tamil Movie|website=FilmiBeat|language=en|access-date=2019-05-15}}</ref> Arivu succeeds in turning the people of the area against Kasi, thus destroying his support.\n\nLater, Arivu joins a leading [[FMCG]] company called Saffron and joins its sales department under Stella Bruce ([[Thambi Ramaiah]]). He manages to bring his friend Bhagya ([[Vijay Vasanth]]) out of Kasi's gang and gets him a job in Saffron. He meets Aadhi ([[Fahadh Faasil]]), Saffron's brand manager, who teaches him how to progress by doing smart work, and Arivu considers him as his inspiration. On the night of April 1, Kasi and his gang attack and stab Bhagya in Saffron's warehouse, whereupon he dies in Arivu's hands. Arivu, filled with rage, tries to attack Kasi, but Kasi's rival Doss ([[Sharath Lohitashwa]]) attacks and  stabs Kasi in retaliation for their previous encounter. Arivu admonishes Kasi for being a paid henchman. Kasi reveals to Arivu that he killed Bhagya on a contract given by Jayaram ([[Anish Kuruvilla]]), the President of Saffron. The motive was that Bhagya tried to help Kasthuri ([[Sneha]]), who filed a case claiming Saffron's products to be [[adulterant|adulterated]], due to which she lost her son. Arivu is addressed by Kasi as being a worse hitman than he himself is. Arivu then saves Kasi, who tells Arivu that all products manufactured by Saffron are adulterated. Arivu takes up a mission to fight such malpractices not only in Saffron, but in all the other five major food companies, including the one owned by Madhav Kurup ([[Mahesh Manjrekar]]). Arivu shares all of his plans with Aadhi. Meanwhile, is revealed that Aadhi is actually Adhiban Madhav, Madhav's son. He joined Saffron to know their trade secrets and merge the company with his father's company.\n\nArivu manages to convince his company's staff to manufacture products as per government regulations for two days. At the same time, he convinces the staff of the other companies to wear a kerchief on their dresses for the next two days, thus tricking the owners into believing that their workers have turned against them. However, Aadhi manages to foil Arivu's plan and [[coercion|coerces]] the other owners to write over the major shares of their company to Madhav, thus making him the deciding authority of all their companies. Aadhi manages to turn the employees against Arivu by tricking them into believing that Arivu worked as a spy for Madhav. Stella Bruce then slaps and humiliates Arivu, while Aadhi pretends to defend Arivu, claiming that he is innocent and that it is the new president who conspired all these. After this, Arivu reveals to Aadhi that Stella Bruce was his ally, and he now knows that Aadhi is the true traitor. Aadhi then burns down the godown containing the unadulterated products and reveals to Arivu that he is Madhav's son and will be the next CEO of the company. He also convinces the staff through his clever tactics and makes them propose his name as the new CEO, also revealing to Arivu that he will make them manufacture adulterated products without their knowledge, now that he commands their loyalty, support, and trust.\n\nArivu goes to the [[Radio Mirchi]] radio station on the night before May 1. He reveals that after the fire, one of the injured department heads of Saffron, Karpaga Vinayagam ([[Ramdoss]]), called him into the ambulance and told him that he followed the regulations on the third day too. Arivu learned from the other Saffron team workers - Kennedy ([[Mansoor Ali Khan (actor)|Mansoor Ali Khan]]), Vinoth ([[Kaali Venkat]]), Ansari ([[Aruldoss]]), and Sivaranjani ([[Vinodhini Vaidyanathan]]) - that after manufacturing quality products for two days, they could not bring themselves to manufacture adulterated products on the next day. They confirm they all followed government regulations, thus manufacturing quality products on the next day. Aadhi, now the CEO, hears the workers say that they will rebel against him and depose him if he tries to revert to manufacturing adulterated products. Arivu adds that the loyalty of all the employees in every field should not be wasted by showing it towards unethical employers. Aadhi then vents his frustration about the failure of his plan.\n\nAll the people in the city show their support to Arivu, who celebrates his success with his love interest Mrinalini ([[Nayanthara]]), friends, family, the people of his slum, and the people of the city as the film ends.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Sivakarthikeyan]] as Arivu\n* [[Fahadh Faasil]] as Adhiban Madhav (Aadhi)\n* [[Nayanthara]] as Mrinalini \"Miru\" (voice dubbed by [[Deepa Venkat]])\n* [[Prakash Raj]] as Kasi\n* [[Sneha (actress)|Sneha]] as Kasthuri\n* [[Thambi Ramaiah]] as Stella Bruce\n* [[RJ Balaji]] as Sriram\n* [[Sathish]] as Hari\n* [[Vijay Vasanth]] as Bhagya\n* [[Robo Shankar]] as Chinna Thambi\n* [[Rohini (actress)|Rohini]] as Ponni\n* [[Charle]] as Murugesan\n* [[Ramdoss]] as Karpaga Vinayagam\n* [[Aruldoss]] as Ansari\n* [[Kaali Venkat]] as Vinoth\n* [[Mansoor Ali Khan (actor)|Mansoor Ali Khan]] as Kennedy\n* [[Vinodhini Vaidyanathan]] as Sivaranjani\n* [[Mime Gopi]] as Kishta\n* [[Y.

The work may be difficult, dangerous, climatically challenging or underpaid. Workers in sweatshops may work long hours with low pay, regardless of laws mandating overtime pay or a [[minimum wage]]; [[child labor]] laws may also be violated. The Fair Labor Association's \"2006 Annual Public Report\" inspected factories for FLA compliance in 18 countries including Bangladesh, El Salvador, Colombia, Guatemala, Malaysia, Thailand, Tunisia, Turkey, China, India, Vietnam, Honduras, Indonesia, Brazil, Mexico, and the US.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fairlabor.org/sites/default/files/documents/reports/2006_annual_public_report.pdf |title=2006 Annual Public Report |publisher=fairlabor.org |accessdate=August 28, 2017}}</ref> The U.S. Department of Labor's \"2015 Findings on the Worst Forms of Child Labor\" found that \"18 countries did not meet the [[International Labour Organization]]'s recommendation for an adequate number of inspectors.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dol.gov/sites/default/files/documents/ilab/reports/child-labor/findings/2015TDA_1.pdf |title=2015 Findings on the Worst Forms of Child Labor |publisher=dol.gov |accessdate=August 28, 2017\n}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Sweatshop in Ludlow Street Tenement, New York cph.3a24271.jpg |thumb|right|A sweatshop in a New York tenement building, c. 1889]]\n\nA sweatshop is a factory or workshop, especially in the [[clothing industry]], where manual workers are employed at very low wages for long hours under poor conditions and many health risks.\n\nMany workplaces through history have been crowded, low-paying and without job security; but the concept of a sweatshop originated between 1830 and 1850 as a specific type of workshop in which a certain type of middleman, the ''sweater'', directed others in garment making (the process of producing clothing) under arduous conditions. The terms ''sweater'' for the middleman and ''sweat system'' for the process of subcontracting [[piecework]] were used in early critiques like [[Charles Kingsley]]'s ''Cheap Clothes and Nasty'', written in 1850, which described conditions in London, England. The workplaces created for the '''sweating system''' (a system of subcontracting in the [[tailor]]ing trade) were called ''sweatshops'' and might contain only a few workers or as many as 300 and more.\n\nBetween 1832 and 1850, sweatshops attracted the rural poor to rapidly growing cities, and attracted immigrants to places such as London and New York City's garment district, located near the [[tenement]]s of New York's [[Lower East Side]]. These sweatshops incurred criticism: labor leaders cited them as crowded, poorly ventilated, and prone to fires and [[rat]] infestations: in many cases, there were many workers crowded into small tenement rooms.\n\nIn the 1890s, a group calling itself the [[National Anti-Sweating League]] was formed in [[Melbourne]] and campaigned successfully for a [[minimum wage]] via trade boards.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/goldstein-vida-jane-6418|title=Goldstein, Vida Jane (1869\u20131949)|last=Brownfoot|first=Janice N.|publisher=National Centre of Biography, Australian National University|location=Canberra}}</ref> A group with the same name campaigned from 1906 in the UK, resulting in the [[Trade Boards Act 1909]].<ref name=Blackburn>Sheila Blackburn (1991) ''The Historical Journal'' '''34''' (1) 43\u201364 \"Ideology and Social Policy: The Origins of the Trade Boards Act\"</ref>\n\nIn 1910, the [[International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union]] was founded to try to improve the condition of these workers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://womenshistory.about.com/od/worklaborunions/a/ilgwu.htm|title=ILGWU|website=About.com Education|access-date=May 17, 2016}}</ref>\n\nCriticism of garment sweatshops became a major force behind workplace safety regulation and [[labor laws]]. As some journalists strove to change working conditions, the term ''sweatshop'' came to refer to a broader set of workplaces whose conditions were considered inferior. In the United States, [[investigative journalism|investigative journalists]], known as [[muckraker]]s, wrote expos\u00e9s of business practices, and [[Progressivism in the United States|progressive]] politicians campaigned for new laws. Notable expos\u00e9s of sweatshop conditions include [[Jacob Riis]]' [[photo journalism|photo documentary]] ''[[How the Other Half Lives]]'' and [[Upton Sinclair]]'s book, ''[[The Jungle]]'', a fictionalized account of the [[meat packing industry]].\n\n[[File:Millville, New Jersey - Dresses.

The pivotal role of this time and place is chronicled at the Lower East Side Tenement Museum, part of the [[Lower East Side Tenement National Historic Site]]. While trade unions, [[minimum wage]] laws, [[fire safety]] codes, and labour laws have made sweatshops (in the original sense) rarer in the [[developed world]], they did not eliminate them, and the term is increasingly associated with factories in the [[developing world]].\n\nIn a report issued in 1994, the United States [[Government Accountability Office]] found that there were still thousands of sweatshops in the United States, using a definition of a ''sweatshop'' as any \"employer that violates more than one federal or state labor law governing minimum wage and overtime, child labor, industrial [[homeworker|homework]], occupational safety and health, workers' compensation, or industry registration\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gao.gov/archive/1995/he95029.pdf |title=Garment Industry : Efforts to Address the Prevalence and Conditions of Sweatshops |publisher=Gao.gov |accessdate=March 31, 2015}}</ref> This recent definition eliminates any historical distinction about the role of a middleman or the items produced, and focuses on the legal standards of developed country workplaces. An area of controversy between supporters of outsourcing production to the [[Third World]] and the anti-sweatshop movement is whether such standards can or should be applied to the workplaces of the developing world.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}\n\nSweatshops are also sometimes implicated in [[human trafficking]] when workers have been tricked into starting work without [[informed consent]], or when workers are kept at work through [[debt bondage]] or mental duress, all of which are more likely if the workforce is drawn from children or the uneducated rural poor.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} Because they often exist in places without effective workplace safety or environmental laws, sweatshops sometimes injure their workers or the environment at greater rates than would be acceptable in developed countries.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} Sometimes [[penal labor]] facilities (employing prisoners) are grouped under the sweatshop label.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} \n\nSweatshops conditions resemble prison labor in many cases, especially from a commonly found Western perspective. In 2014 Apple was caught \"failing to protect its workers\" in one of its Pegatron factories. Overwhelmed workers were caught falling asleep during their 12-hour shifts and an undercover reporter had to work 18 days in a row.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-30532463|title=Apple 'failing to protect Chinese factory workers' |website=BBC News|language=en-GB|access-date=March 10, 2016}}</ref> Sweatshops in question carry characteristics such as compulsory pregnancy tests for female laborers and terrorization from supervisors into submission.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/editorials/leading-article-the-gruesome-reality-of-sweatshops-2094318.html|title=Leading Article: The Gruesome Reality of Sweatshops |work=Independent.co.uk |date=October 1, 2010 |accessdate=April 2, 2013}}</ref> Workers then go into a state of forced labor, if even one day of work is not accounted for, most are immediately fired. These working conditions have been the source of suicidal unrest within factories in the past. Chinese sweatshops known to have increased numbers of suicidal employees have suicide nets covering the whole site, in place to stop over-worked and stressed employees leaping to their deaths.{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\n==Contemporary use of the term==\n{{main|Nike sweatshops}}\n\n[[File:Lindintracuay.jpg|thumb|right|A modern-day sweatshop]]\nThe phrase sweatshop was coined in 1850, meaning a factory or workshop where workers are treated unfairly, for example having low wages, working long hours and in poor conditions. Since 1850, immigrants have been flocking to work at sweatshops in cities like London and New York for more than one century. Many of them worked in tiny, stuffy rooms which are prone to fire hazards and rat infestations. The term sweatshop was used from Charles Kingsley's Cheap Clothes and Nasty (1850) describing such workplaces create \u2018sweating system\u2019 of workers. (Blackburn, 1991)<ref>Blackburn, S. (1991) Ideology and social policy. The Historical Journals.</ref> The idea of minimum wage and Labour's union was not developed until the 1890s. This issue appears to be solved by some anti-sweatshops organisation. However, the ongoing development of the issue is showing a different situation.\n\nWorld-known fashion brands such as [[H&M]], [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], [[Adidas]] and [[Uniqlo]] are all involved in such issues of sweatshops. In 2015, anti-sweatshops protesters marched against the Japanese fast-fashion brand Uniqlo in Hong Kong. Along with the Japanese anti-sweatshops organisation, [[Human Rights Now!]], Hong Kong Labour Organisation Students and Scholars against Corporate Misbehaviour ([[Students and Scholars Against Corporate Misbehaviour|SACOM]]) protested for the \"harsh and dangerous\" working conditions in Uniqlo's value-added factories in China.<ref>The Fashion Law (2015).

Similar stories are still heard in the fashion industry in the past decades.\n\n==Contributing factors==\n\n===Fast fashion===\n{{main|Fast fashion}}\nA trend called \"fast fashion\" has contributed to the rise of sweatshops. Fast fashion refers to \"rapid reorders and new orders that retailers now exert as they discern sales trends in real time\" (Ross, 2015)<ref>Ross, R. J. S. (2015). The high toll of fast fashion. Dissent. Retrieved September 20, 2017 from Dissent, web site :https://www.dissentmagazine.org/blog/the-true-cost-review-fastfashion-rana-plaza-accord{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}.</ref> To catch up with the fast-changing fashion trends to satisfy increasing customers\u2019 demand, these fast-fashion brands have to react and arrange production accordingly. To lower production and the storage cost, they are always searching for cheaper labour which can produce orders in a short period of time. This results in workers suffering from unreasonably long working hours without reasonable payment. A documentary, \"[[The True Cost]]\" (2015), claims that sweatshops relieve pressure on retailers by passing it to factory owners and, ultimately, workers.\n\n===Government corruption and inadequate labour protection legislation===\nGovernment corruption and inadequate labour protection legislation in developing countries have also contributed to the suffering of their employees. Weak law enforcement has attracted capitalists to invest in these developing countries, which is also a serious problem that leads to arisen of sweatshops. Without reasonable law restrictions, capitalists are able to set up fashion manufacturing plants at a lower cost. According to Zamen (2012),<ref>Zamen, I.

For example, labour camps in Dubai, UAE do not have proper conditions for the workers and if they protest they can be deported if they are foreigners.<ref>https://www.business-humanrights.org/en/how-did-new-york-university-uphold-workers-rights-during-construction-of-abu-dhabi-satellite-campus</ref><ref>https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/feb/10/migrants-united-arab-emirates-human-rights-watch</ref>\n\n===Low education level===\nIt is suggested that these workers should fight back and protect their own labour rights, yet a lot of them in developing countries are ignorant about their own right because of low education level. According to the UNESCO Institute of Statistics (2016),<ref>UNESCO Insititute of Statistics, (2016) Population by minimum completed level of education.</ref> most of these sweatshops are located in countries that have low education levels. Harrison, A. & Scorse, J. (2004)<ref>Harrison, A. & Scorse, J. (2004) The Nike effect: Anti-sweatshop activists and labor market outcomes in Indonesia. Economics department of Yale University.</ref> mentions that most of the workers do not know about their rights, such as matters about wages and supposed working conditions, thus they have no skill set to fight for their labour rights through collective bargain (such as strike or work to rule). Their ignorance makes hard for them to improve working conditions on their own.\n\n==Impacts of sweatshops==\n===Child labour===\n{{main|Child labour}}\nChild labour is one of the most serious impacts that sweatshops have brought. According to the International Labour Office (2013),<ref>International Labor Office (2013). Making progress against child labour. Retrieved from http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---ed_norm/---ipec/documents/publication/wcms_221513.pdf.</ref> more than 250 million children are in the employment of which 170 million of them are engaged in textiles and garments industry in developing countries. In hopes of earning a living, many girls in these countries, such as Bangladesh and India, are willing to work at low wages for long working hours, said Sofie Ovaa, an officer of Stop Child Labour (Moulds, 2013).<ref>Moulds, J. (2013) Child labor in the fashion supply chain. theguardian. Retrieved from https://labs.theguardian.com/unicef-child-labour/.</ref> Most fashion manufacturing chains employ low-skilled labour and as child labour are easier to manage and even more suitable than adult labour for certain jobs such as cotton picking, it becomes a particular problem in sweatshops as they are vulnerable with no backups.\n\n===Environmental pollution===\nNot only workers are impacted by sweatshops, but the neighboring environment as well, through lax environmental laws set up in developing countries to help reduce the production cost of the fashion industry. Clothing manufacturing is still one of the most polluting industries in the world. Nevertheless, the environment of developing countries remained deeply polluted by the untreated waste. The Burigana River in Bangladesh is now black in colour and pronounced biologically dead because neighbouring leather tanneries are discharging more than 150 cubics of liquid waste daily. (Stanko, 2013)<ref>Stanko, N. (2013). Sweatshops. Greeniacs Nation.

Many workers in the tanneries suffer from serious skin illness since they are exposed to toxic chemicals for long period of time. Air is being highly polluted in such area because the factories do not install proper ventilation facilities. Sweatshops is also an environmental issue as it is not only causing harm to the human right of labour but also their living environment.\n\n==Anti-sweatshop movement==\nSome of the earliest sweatshop critics were found in the 19th century [[abolitionism|abolitionist]] movement that had originally coalesced in opposition to chattel [[slavery]], and many abolitionists saw similarities between slavery and sweatshop work. As slavery was successively outlawed in industrial countries between 1794 (in France) and 1865 (in the United States), some abolitionists sought to broaden the anti-slavery consensus to include other forms of harsh labor, including sweatshops. As it happened, the first significant law to address sweatshops (the [[Factory Act|Factory Act of 1833]]) was passed in the United Kingdom several years after the slave trade (1807) and ownership of slaves (1833) were made illegal.\n\nUltimately, the abolitionist movement split apart. Some advocates focused on working conditions and found common cause with trade unions and [[Marxists]] and socialist political groups, or [[progressive movement]] and the [[muckraker]]s. Others focused on the continued slave trade and [[involuntary servitude]] in the colonial world. For those groups that remained focused on slavery, sweatshops became one of the primary objects of controversy. Workplaces across multiple sectors of the economy were categorized as sweatshops. However, there were fundamental philosophical disagreements about what constituted slavery. Unable to agree on the status of sweatshops, the abolitionists working with the [[League of Nations]] and the United Nations ultimately backed away from efforts to define slavery, and focused instead on a common precursor of slavery \u2013 [[human trafficking]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Miers|first=Suzanne|year=2003|title=Slavery in the Twentieth Century: The Evolution of a Global Problem|publisher=Alta Mira Press, Walnut Creek, California}}</ref>\n\nThose focused on working conditions included [[Friedrich Engels]], whose book ''[[The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844]]'' would inspire the Marxist movement named for his collaborator, [[Karl Marx]]. In the United Kingdom the first effective [[Factory Acts|Factory Act]] was introduced in 1833 to help improve the condition of workers by limiting work hours and the use of child labor; but this applied only to textile factories. Later Acts extended protection to factories in other industries, but not until 1867 was there any similar protection for employees in small workshops, and not until 1891 was it possible to effectively enforce the legislation where the workplace was a dwelling (as was often the case for sweatshops). The formation of the [[International Labour Organization]] in 1919 under the League of Nations and then the United Nations sought to address the plight of workers the world over. Concern over working conditions as described by muckraker journalists during the [[Progressive Era]] in the United States saw the passage of new workers rights laws and ultimately resulted in the [[Fair Labor Standards Act]] of 1938, passed during the [[New Deal]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.finduslaw.com/fair_labor_standards_act_flsa_29_u_s_code_chapter_8|title=Fair Labor Standards Act \u2013 FLSA \u2013 29 U.S. Code Chapter 8|work=finduslaw.com|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516054443/http://finduslaw.com/fair_labor_standards_act_flsa_29_u_s_code_chapter_8|archive-date=May 16, 2008|df=}}</ref>\n\nOn February 4, 1997 Mayor Ed Boyle of [[North Olmsted]], in the U.S. state of [[Ohio]], introduced the first piece of legislation prohibiting the government of purchasing, renting, or taking on consignment any and all goods made under sweatshop conditions and including in the definition those goods made by political prisoners and incarcerated criminals.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.villagelife.org/news/archives/12-4-97_sweatshopban.html|title=Village Life News: Ban on Sweatshop Products Becomes Rule|website=www.villagelife.org|access-date=June 11, 2018}}</ref> Similar legislation was subsequently passed in other American cities such as Detroit, New York, and San Francisco.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}  Later Mayor Boyle introduced the legislation to the Mayors and Managers Association where it was immediately endorsed, and he was invited by President [[Bill Clinton]] to address a panel studying the subject in Washington, DC.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nClothing and footwear [[Factory|factories]] overseas have progressively improved working conditions because the high demand of [[anti-sweatshop movement]], labour right advocates.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.laborrights.org/in-the-news/anti-sweatshop-movement-achieving-gains-overseas|title=Anti-Sweatshop Movement Is Achieving Gains Overseas {{!}} International Labor Rights Forum|website=www.laborrights.org|access-date=May 17, 2016}}</ref> Sweatshops overseas have been receiving enormous amounts of pressure. Around the working conditions from college students, and other opponents of sweatshops which has led to some of the powerful companies like [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] and the Gap who have agreed to cut back on [[child labour]],<ref name=\":3\" /> restrict the use of dangerous and poisonous [[Chemical substance|chemicals]], and drop the average rate of employees working 80-hour weeks, according to groups that monitor such factories. Labour advocates say, this could be a major turning point after 4 decades of workers in Asia and Latin American factories being under paid, under appreciated and working in an unsafe environment.\n\nRecently, there have been strides to eradicate sweatshops through government action, for example by increasing the minimum wage. In China, a developing country that is known to be a hub for sweatshops due to relaxed labor laws, high population and low minimum wage, the minimum wage is set to be raised by approximately 7% in 10 provinces by the end of 2018.<ref>CBNEditor. (May 26, 2018). 10 Chinese Provinces Raise Minimum Wages Levels in 2018. Retrieved September 21, 2018, from China Banking News: http://www.chinabankingnews.com/2018/05/26/10-chinese-provinces-raise-minimum-wages-level-since-start-2018/</ref> As well as this governments are also enforcing stricter labor laws such as in 2013 after the collapse of Rana Plaza in Bangladesh, a large 5 storied sweatshops that killed 1135 people due to the building not being up to code, Bangladeshi police shut down many other factories after safety checks were completed and not met. However, no action has been as beneficial to the anti-sweatshop movement as that of the rise of social media. Social media has allowed for the world to see exactly what companies are doing and how they are doing it instantaneously, for free and is distributed to a wide audience. The platforms have allowed for viral videos, hundreds of thousands of retweets of quote's or statistic's, millions of liked and shared pictures etc. to be spread to consumers in regards to companies production methods without any censorship and thus forces brands to be more transparent and ethical with their production practices. This is because it is now very for a brands exemplary reputation to be completely destroyed by a bystander with a smart phone who happens to see a brands product being made in a sweatshop where its workers are treated inhumanely and simply uploading their findings. If a brands reputation is negative they are likely to lose customers as more and more consumers begin to care about sustainable and ethical products thus the fewer consumers the fewer sales and the less profit.\n\nHowever, social media isn\u2019t just helping to expose brands who are using sweatshops and unethical production practices but also is allowing for companies that are trying to increase awareness of the anti-sweatshop movement to spread their message quickly and efficiently.

In particular, he compares the [[Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire]] in 1911 New York to the [[2013 Dhaka garment factory collapse|collapse of Rana Plaza]] in 2013 Bangladesh. He argues that the former galvanized the population to political activism that eventually pushed through reforms not only pertaining to workplace safety, but also the [[minimum wage]], the [[eight-hour day]], [[workers' compensation]], [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]], and the [[Clean Water Act]]. American corporations responded by shifting production to developing nations where such protections did not exist. Loomis elaborates:\n\n{{quote|So in 2013, when over 1100 workers die at Rana Plaza in Bangladesh, it is the same industry as the Triangle Fire, with the same subcontracted system of production that allows apparel companies to avoid responsibility for work as the Triangle Fire, and with the same workforce of young and poor women, the same type of cruel bosses, and the same terrible workplace safety standards as the Triangle Fire. The difference is that most of us can't even find Bangladesh on a map, not to mention know enough about it to express the type of outrage our ancestors did after Triangle.

The theory holds that developing countries improve their condition by doing something that they do \"better\" than industrialized nations (in this case, they charge less but do the same work). Developed countries will also be better off because their workers can shift to jobs that they do better. These are jobs that some economists say usually entail a level of education and training that is exceptionally difficult to obtain in the developing world. Thus, economists like Sachs say, developing countries get factories and jobs that they would not otherwise. Some{{Who|date=September 2011}} would say with this situation occurs when developing countries try to increase wages because sweatshops tend to just get moved on to a new state that is more welcoming. This leads to a situation where states often don't try to increase wages for sweatshop workers for fear of losing investment and boosted GDP. However, this only means average wages around the world will increase at a steady rate. A nation only gets left behind if it demands wages higher than the current market price for that labor.\n\nWhen asked about the working condition in sweatshops, proponents say that although wages and working conditions may appear inferior by the standards of developed nations, they are actually improvements over what the people in developing countries had before. It is said that if jobs in such factories did not improve their workers' [[standard of living]], those workers would not have taken the jobs when they appeared. It is also often pointed out that, unlike in the industrialized world, the sweatshops are not replacing high-paying jobs. Rather, sweatshops offer an improvement over [[subsistence farming]] and other back-breaking tasks, or even prostitution, trash picking, or [[starvation]] by unemployment.<ref name=\"meyerson\" /><ref>{{cite news| last =Kristof| first =Nicholas| authorlink =Nicholas Kristof| title =Inviting All Democrats| work =The New York Times| date =January 14, 2004| url =https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE0DD1330F937A25752C0A9629C8B63| archive-url =https://archive.is/20120526094048/http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE0DD1330F937A25752C0A9629C8B63| url-status =dead| archive-date =May 26, 2012| access-date =April 4, 2008}}</ref>\n\nThe absence of the work opportunities provided by sweatshops can quickly lead to malnourishment or starvation.

According to an article in Gale Opposing Viewpoints in Context, sweatshops became prevalent in the United States during the Industrial Revolution. Although the working conditions and wages in these factories were very poor, as new jobs in factories began to appear, people left the hard life of farming to work in these factories, and the agricultural nature of the economy shifted into a manufacturing one because of this industrialization. However, during this new industrialized economy, the labor movement drove the rise in the average level of income as factory workers began to demand better wages and working conditions. Through much struggle, sufficient wealth was created and a large middle class began to emerge. Workers and advocates were able to achieve basic rights for workers, which included the right to form unions, and negotiate terms such as wages, overtime pay, health insurance, and retirement pensions; and eventually they were also able to attain legal protections such as minimum wage standards, and discrimination and sexual abuse protections. Furthermore, Congress set forth to ensure a minimum set of safety standards were followed in workplaces by passing the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) in 1970. These developments were able to improve working environments for Americans but it was through sweatshops that the economy grew and people were able to accumulate wealth and move out of poverty.\n\nIn contrast, similar efforts in developing nations have not produced the same results, because of corruption and lack of democracy in communist nations such as China and Vietnam, worker intimidation and murder in Latin America\u2014and corruption throughout the developing world. These barriers prevent creation of similar legal protections for workers in these countries, as numerous studies by the International Labour Organization show.<ref name=\"Corporations and Worker's Rights\">{{cite web| first =Anup| last =Shah| title=Corporations and Workers Rights |publisher =Global Issues| url =http://www.globalissues.org/article/57/corporations-and-workers-rights| accessdate =May 9, 2013}}</ref> Nonetheless, a boycott approach to protesting these conditions is likely to hurt workers willing to accept employment even under poor working conditions, as a loss of employment would result in a comparatively worse level of poverty.

The terms ''sweater'' for the middleman and ''sweat system'' for the process of subcontracting [[piecework]] were used in early critiques like [[Charles Kingsley]]'s ''Cheap Clothes and Nasty'', written in 1850, which described conditions in London, England. The workplaces created for the '''sweating system''' (a system of subcontracting in the [[tailor]]ing trade) were called ''sweatshops'' and might contain only a few workers or as many as 300 and more.\n\nBetween 1832 and 1850, sweatshops attracted the rural poor to rapidly growing cities, and attracted immigrants to places such as London and New York City's garment district, located near the [[tenement]]s of New York's [[Lower East Side]]. These sweatshops incurred criticism: labor leaders cited them as crowded, poorly ventilated, and prone to fires and [[rat]] infestations: in many cases, there were many workers crowded into small tenement rooms.\n\nIn the 1890s, a group calling itself the [[National Anti-Sweating League]] was formed in [[Melbourne]] and campaigned successfully for a [[minimum wage]] via trade boards.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/goldstein-vida-jane-6418|title=Goldstein, Vida Jane (1869\u20131949)|last=Brownfoot|first=Janice N.|publisher=National Centre of Biography, Australian National University|location=Canberra}}</ref> A group with the same name campaigned from 1906 in the UK, resulting in the [[Trade Boards Act 1909]].<ref name=Blackburn>Sheila Blackburn (1991) ''The Historical Journal'' '''34''' (1) 43\u201364 \"Ideology and Social Policy: The Origins of the Trade Boards Act\"</ref>\n\nIn 1910, the [[International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union]] was founded to try to improve the condition of these workers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://womenshistory.about.com/od/worklaborunions/a/ilgwu.htm|title=ILGWU|website=About.com Education|access-date=May 17, 2016}}</ref>\n\nCriticism of garment sweatshops became a major force behind workplace safety regulation and [[labor laws]]. As some journalists strove to change working conditions, the term ''sweatshop'' came to refer to a broader set of workplaces whose conditions were considered inferior. In the United States, [[investigative journalism|investigative journalists]], known as [[muckraker]]s, wrote expos\u00e9s of business practices, and [[Progressivism in the United States|progressive]] politicians campaigned for new laws. Notable expos\u00e9s of sweatshop conditions include [[Jacob Riis]]' [[photo journalism|photo documentary]] ''[[How the Other Half Lives]]'' and [[Upton Sinclair]]'s book, ''[[The Jungle]]'', a fictionalized account of the [[meat packing industry]].\n\n[[File:Millville, New Jersey - Dresses.

The pivotal role of this time and place is chronicled at the Lower East Side Tenement Museum, part of the [[Lower East Side Tenement National Historic Site]]. While trade unions, [[minimum wage]] laws, [[fire safety]] codes, and labour laws have made sweatshops (in the original sense) rarer in the [[developed world]], they did not eliminate them, and the term is increasingly associated with factories in the [[developing world]].\n\nIn a report issued in 1994, the United States [[Government Accountability Office]] found that there were still thousands of sweatshops in the United States, using a definition of a ''sweatshop'' as any \"employer that violates more than one federal or state labor law governing minimum wage and overtime, child labor, industrial [[homeworker|homework]], occupational safety and health, workers' compensation, or industry registration\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gao.gov/archive/1995/he95029.pdf |title=Garment Industry : Efforts to Address the Prevalence and Conditions of Sweatshops |publisher=Gao.gov |accessdate=March 31, 2015}}</ref> This recent definition eliminates any historical distinction about the role of a middleman or the items produced, and focuses on the legal standards of developed country workplaces. An area of controversy between supporters of outsourcing production to the [[Third World]] and the anti-sweatshop movement is whether such standards can or should be applied to the workplaces of the developing world.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}\n\nSweatshops are also sometimes implicated in [[human trafficking]] when workers have been tricked into starting work without [[informed consent]], or when workers are kept at work through [[debt bondage]] or mental duress, all of which are more likely if the workforce is drawn from children or the uneducated rural poor.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} Because they often exist in places without effective workplace safety or environmental laws, sweatshops sometimes injure their workers or the environment at greater rates than would be acceptable in developed countries.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} Sometimes [[penal labor]] facilities (employing prisoners) are grouped under the sweatshop label.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} \n\nSweatshops conditions resemble prison labor in many cases, especially from a commonly found Western perspective.

Since 1850, immigrants have been flocking to work at sweatshops in cities like London and New York for more than one century. Many of them worked in tiny, stuffy rooms which are prone to fire hazards and rat infestations. The term sweatshop was used from Charles Kingsley's Cheap Clothes and Nasty (1850) describing such workplaces create \u2018sweating system\u2019 of workers. (Blackburn, 1991)<ref>Blackburn, S.

This issue appears to be solved by some anti-sweatshops organisation. However, the ongoing development of the issue is showing a different situation.\n\nWorld-known fashion brands such as [[H&M]], [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], [[Adidas]] and [[Uniqlo]] are all involved in such issues of sweatshops.

Similar stories are still heard in the fashion industry in the past decades.\n\n==Contributing factors==\n\n===Fast fashion===\n{{main|Fast fashion}}\nA trend called \"fast fashion\" has also contributed to the rise of sweatshops.

To lower production and the storage cost, they are always searching for cheaper labour which can produce orders in a short period of time. This results in workers suffering from unreasonably long working hours without reasonable payment. A documentary, \"[[The True Cost]]\" (2015), claims that sweatshops relieve pressure on retailers by passing it to factory owners and, ultimately, workers.\n\n===Government corruption and inadequate labour protection legislation===\nGovernment corruption and inadequate labour protection legislation in developing countries have also contributed to the suffering of their employees. Weak law enforcement has attracted capitalists to invest in these developing countries, which is also a serious problem that leads to arisen of sweatshops. Without reasonable law restrictions, capitalists are able to set up fashion manufacturing plants at a lower cost. According to Zamen (2012),<ref>Zamen, I.

According to the UNESCO Institute of Statistics (2016),<ref>UNESCO Insititute of Statistics, (2016) Population by minimum completed level of education.</ref> most of these sweatshops are located in countries that have low education levels. Harrison, A. & Scorse, J. (2004)<ref>Harrison, A. & Scorse, J. (2004) The Nike effect: Anti-sweatshop activists and labor market outcomes in Indonesia. Economics department of Yale University.</ref> mentions that most of the workers do not know about their rights, such as matters about wages and supposed working conditions, thus they have no skill set to fight for their labour rights through collective bargain (such as strike or work to rule). Their ignorance makes hard for them to improve working conditions on their own.\n\n==Impacts of sweatshops==\n===Child labour===\n{{main|Child labour}}\nChild labour is one of the most serious impacts that sweatshops have brought. According to the International Labour Office (2013),<ref>International Labor Office (2013). Making progress against child labour. Retrieved from http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---ed_norm/---ipec/documents/publication/wcms_221513.pdf.</ref> more than 250 million children are in the employment of which 170 million of them are engaged in textiles and garments industry in developing countries. In hopes of earning a living, many girls in these countries, such as Bangladesh and India, are willing to work at low wages for long working hours, said Sofie Ovaa, an officer of Stop Child Labour (Moulds, 2013).<ref>Moulds, J. (2013) Child labor in the fashion supply chain. theguardian. Retrieved from https://labs.theguardian.com/unicef-child-labour/.</ref> Most fashion manufacturing chains employ low-skilled labour and as child labour are easier to manage and even more suitable than adult labour for certain jobs such as cotton picking, it becomes a particular problem in sweatshops as they are vulnerable with no backups.\n\n===Environmental pollution===\nNot only workers are impacted by sweatshops, but the neighboring environment as well, through lax environmental laws set up in developing countries to help reduce the production cost of the fashion industry. Clothing manufacturing is still one of the most polluting industries in the world. Nevertheless, the environment of developing countries remained deeply polluted by the untreated waste. The Burigana River in Bangladesh is now black in colour and pronounced biologically dead because neighbouring leather tanneries are discharging more than 150 cubics of liquid waste daily. (Stanko, 2013)<ref>Stanko, N. (2013). Sweatshops. Greeniacs Nation.

Many workers in the tanneries suffer from serious skin illness since they are exposed to toxic chemicals for long period of time. Air is being highly polluted in such area because the factories do not install proper ventilation facilities. Sweatshops is also an environmental issue as it is not only causing harm to the human right of labour but also their living environment.\n\n==Anti-sweatshop movement==\nSome of the earliest sweatshop critics were found in the 19th century [[abolitionism|abolitionist]] movement that had originally coalesced in opposition to chattel [[slavery]], and many abolitionists saw similarities between slavery and sweatshop work. As slavery was successively outlawed in industrial countries between 1794 (in France) and 1865 (in the United States), some abolitionists sought to broaden the anti-slavery consensus to include other forms of harsh labor, including sweatshops. As it happened, the first significant law to address sweatshops (the [[Factory Act|Factory Act of 1833]]) was passed in the United Kingdom several years after the slave trade (1807) and ownership of slaves (1833) were made illegal.\n\nUltimately, the abolitionist movement split apart. Some advocates focused on working conditions and found common cause with trade unions and [[Marxists]] and socialist political groups, or [[progressive movement]] and the [[muckraker]]s. Others focused on the continued slave trade and [[involuntary servitude]] in the colonial world. For those groups that remained focused on slavery, sweatshops became one of the primary objects of controversy. Workplaces across multiple sectors of the economy were categorized as sweatshops. However, there were fundamental philosophical disagreements about what constituted slavery. Unable to agree on the status of sweatshops, the abolitionists working with the [[League of Nations]] and the United Nations ultimately backed away from efforts to define slavery, and focused instead on a common precursor of slavery \u2013 [[human trafficking]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Miers|first=Suzanne|year=2003|title=Slavery in the Twentieth Century: The Evolution of a Global Problem|publisher=Alta Mira Press, Walnut Creek, California}}</ref>\n\nThose focused on working conditions included [[Friedrich Engels]], whose book ''[[The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844]]'' would inspire the Marxist movement named for his collaborator, [[Karl Marx]]. In the United Kingdom the first effective [[Factory Acts|Factory Act]] was introduced in 1833 to help improve the condition of workers by limiting work hours and the use of child labor; but this applied only to textile factories. Later Acts extended protection to factories in other industries, but not until 1867 was there any similar protection for employees in small workshops, and not until 1891 was it possible to effectively enforce the legislation where the workplace was a dwelling (as was often the case for sweatshops). The formation of the [[International Labour Organization]] in 1919 under the League of Nations and then the United Nations sought to address the plight of workers the world over. Concern over working conditions as described by muckraker journalists during the [[Progressive Era]] in the United States saw the passage of new workers rights laws and ultimately resulted in the [[Fair Labor Standards Act]] of 1938, passed during the [[New Deal]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.finduslaw.com/fair_labor_standards_act_flsa_29_u_s_code_chapter_8|title=Fair Labor Standards Act \u2013 FLSA \u2013 29 U.S. Code Chapter 8|work=finduslaw.com|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516054443/http://finduslaw.com/fair_labor_standards_act_flsa_29_u_s_code_chapter_8|archive-date=May 16, 2008|df=}}</ref>\n\nOn February 4, 1997 Mayor Ed Boyle of [[North Olmsted]], in the U.S. state of [[Ohio]], introduced the first piece of legislation prohibiting the government of purchasing, renting, or taking on consignment any and all goods made under sweatshop conditions and including in the definition those goods made by political prisoners and incarcerated criminals.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.villagelife.org/news/archives/12-4-97_sweatshopban.html|title=Village Life News: Ban on Sweatshop Products Becomes Rule|website=www.villagelife.org|access-date=June 11, 2018}}</ref> Similar legislation was subsequently passed in other American cities such as Detroit, New York, and San Francisco.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}  Later Mayor Boyle introduced the legislation to the Mayors and Managers Association where it was immediately endorsed, and he was invited by President [[Bill Clinton]] to address a panel studying the subject in Washington, DC.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nClothing and footwear [[Factory|factories]] overseas have progressively improved working conditions because the high demand of [[anti-sweatshop movement]], labour right advocates.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.laborrights.org/in-the-news/anti-sweatshop-movement-achieving-gains-overseas|title=Anti-Sweatshop Movement Is Achieving Gains Overseas {{!}} International Labor Rights Forum|website=www.laborrights.org|access-date=May 17, 2016}}</ref> Sweatshops overseas have been receiving enormous amounts of pressure. Around the working conditions from college students, and other opponents of sweatshops which has led to some of the powerful companies like [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] and the Gap who have agreed to cut back on [[child labour]],<ref name=\":3\" /> restrict the use of dangerous and poisonous [[Chemical substance|chemicals]], and drop the average rate of employees working 80-hour weeks, according to groups that monitor such factories. Labour advocates say, this could be a major turning point after 4 decades of workers in Asia and Latin American factories being under paid, under appreciated and working in an unsafe environment.\n\nRecently, there have been strides to eradicate sweatshops through government action, for example by increasing the minimum wage. In China, a developing country that is known to be a hub for sweatshops due to relaxed labor laws, high population and low minimum wage, the minimum wage is set to be raised by approximately 7% in 10 provinces by the end of 2018.<ref>CBNEditor. (May 26, 2018). 10 Chinese Provinces Raise Minimum Wages Levels in 2018. Retrieved September 21, 2018, from China Banking News: http://www.chinabankingnews.com/2018/05/26/10-chinese-provinces-raise-minimum-wages-level-since-start-2018/</ref> As well as this governments are also enforcing stricter labor laws such as in 2013 after the collapse of Rana Plaza in Bangladesh, a large 5 storied sweatshops that killed 1135 people due to the building not being up to code, Bangladeshi police shut down many other factories after safety checks were completed and not met. However, no action has been as beneficial to the anti-sweatshop movement as that of the rise of social media. Social media has allowed for the world to see exactly what companies are doing and how they are doing it instantaneously, for free and is distributed to a wide audience. The platforms have allowed for viral videos, hundreds of thousands of retweets of quote's or statistic's, millions of liked and shared pictures etc. to be spread to consumers in regards to companies production methods without any censorship and thus forces brands to be more transparent and ethical with their production practices. This is because it is now very for a brands exemplary reputation to be completely destroyed by a bystander with a smart phone who happens to see a brands product being made in a sweatshop where its workers are treated inhumanely and simply uploading their findings. If a brands reputation is negative they are likely to lose customers as more and more consumers begin to care about sustainable and ethical products thus the fewer consumers the fewer sales and the less profit.\n\nHowever, social media isn\u2019t just helping to expose brands who are using sweatshops and unethical production practices but also is allowing for companies that are trying to increase awareness of the anti-sweatshop movement to spread their message quickly and efficiently. For example, in May 2017 Mama Cash and The Clean Clothes Campaign, both organizations that are working towards abolishing sweatshops as well as creating a world of sustainable and ethical apparel practices, worked together to create The Women Power Fashion Pop-up.<ref name=\"fashionunited.uk\">Hendriksz, V.

Outside of the pop-up was a petition that consumers could sign in order to convince brands to be more transparent with their clothing manufacturing processes.<ref name=\"fashionunited.uk\"/> The campaign went viral and created a significant buzz for the anti-sweatshop movement as well as the work of Mama Cash and The Clean Clothes Campaign.\n\nCurrently, there is a major issue with the anti-sweatshop movement as where do supporters place the displaced workers? Even after escaping the sweatshop industry the workers need a job to sustain themselves and their families. For example, in Bangladesh, a country in which has one of the lowest minimum wages in the world, of $68 per month,<ref name=\"theguardian.com\">The Guardian. (July 18, 2016).

In particular, he compares the [[Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire]] in 1911 New York to the [[2013 Dhaka garment factory collapse|collapse of Rana Plaza]] in 2013 Bangladesh. He argues that the former galvanized the population to political activism that eventually pushed through reforms not only pertaining to workplace safety, but also the [[minimum wage]], the [[eight-hour day]], [[workers' compensation]], [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]], and the [[Clean Water Act]]. American corporations responded by shifting production to developing nations where such protections did not exist. Loomis elaborates:\n\n{{quote|So in 2013, when over 1100 workers die at Rana Plaza in Bangladesh, it is the same industry as the Triangle Fire, with the same subcontracted system of production that allows apparel companies to avoid responsibility for work as the Triangle Fire, and with the same workforce of young and poor women, the same type of cruel bosses, and the same terrible workplace safety standards as the Triangle Fire. The difference is that most of us can't even find Bangladesh on a map, not to mention know enough about it to express the type of outrage our ancestors did after Triangle.

The theory holds that developing countries improve their condition by doing something that they do \"better\" than industrialized nations (in this case, they charge less but do the same work). Developed countries will also be better off because their workers can shift to jobs that they do better. These are jobs that some economists say usually entail a level of education and training that is exceptionally difficult to obtain in the developing world. Thus, economists like Sachs say, developing countries get factories and jobs that they would not otherwise. Some{{Who|date=September 2011}} would say with this situation occurs when developing countries try to increase wages because sweatshops tend to just get moved on to a new state that is more welcoming. This leads to a situation where states often don't try to increase wages for sweatshop workers for fear of losing investment and boosted GDP. However, this only means average wages around the world will increase at a steady rate. A nation only gets left behind if it demands wages higher than the current market price for that labor.\n\nWhen asked about the working condition in sweatshops, proponents say that although wages and working conditions may appear inferior by the standards of developed nations, they are actually improvements over what the people in developing countries had before. It is said that if jobs in such factories did not improve their workers' [[standard of living]], those workers would not have taken the jobs when they appeared. It is also often pointed out that, unlike in the industrialized world, the sweatshops are not replacing high-paying jobs. Rather, sweatshops offer an improvement over [[subsistence farming]] and other back-breaking tasks, or even prostitution, trash picking, or [[starvation]] by unemployment.<ref name=\"meyerson\" /><ref>{{cite news| last =Kristof| first =Nicholas| authorlink =Nicholas Kristof| title =Inviting All Democrats| work =The New York Times| date =January 14, 2004| url =https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE0DD1330F937A25752C0A9629C8B63| archive-url =https://archive.is/20120526094048/http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE0DD1330F937A25752C0A9629C8B63| url-status =dead| archive-date =May 26, 2012| access-date =April 4, 2008}}</ref>\n\nThe absence of the work opportunities provided by sweatshops can quickly lead to malnourishment or starvation.

According to an article in Gale Opposing Viewpoints in Context, sweatshops became prevalent in the United States during the Industrial Revolution. Although the working conditions and wages in these factories were very poor, as new jobs in factories began to appear, people left the hard life of farming to work in these factories, and the agricultural nature of the economy shifted into a manufacturing one because of this industrialization. However, during this new industrialized economy, the labor movement drove the rise in the average level of income as factory workers began to demand better wages and working conditions. Through much struggle, sufficient wealth was created and a large middle class began to emerge. Workers and advocates were able to achieve basic rights for workers, which included the right to form unions, and negotiate terms such as wages, overtime pay, health insurance, and retirement pensions; and eventually they were also able to attain legal protections such as minimum wage standards, and discrimination and sexual abuse protections. Furthermore, Congress set forth to ensure a minimum set of safety standards were followed in workplaces by passing the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) in 1970. These developments were able to improve working environments for Americans but it was through sweatshops that the economy grew and people were able to accumulate wealth and move out of poverty.\n\nIn contrast, similar efforts in developing nations have not produced the same results, because of corruption and lack of democracy in communist nations such as China and Vietnam, worker intimidation and murder in Latin America\u2014and corruption throughout the developing world. These barriers prevent creation of similar legal protections for workers in these countries, as numerous studies by the International Labour Organization show.<ref name=\"Corporations and Worker's Rights\">{{cite web| first =Anup| last =Shah| title=Corporations and Workers Rights |publisher =Global Issues| url =http://www.globalissues.org/article/57/corporations-and-workers-rights| accessdate =May 9, 2013}}</ref> Nonetheless, a boycott approach to protesting these conditions is likely to hurt workers willing to accept employment even under poor working conditions, as a loss of employment would result in a comparatively worse level of poverty.

TWTC combines every possible service that brings together a vast consulting service on trade-related issues, trading partners, [[Distributor (business)|supplier]]s, and [[Market (economics)|markets]].\n\nThis four-in-one complex, located in the city's [[Xinyi District, Taipei|Xinyi District]], is designed to accommodate the needs of the international business community, which is why there is not just one, but four structures at the TWTC. The Exhibition Hall, [[Taipei International Convention Center|International Convention Center]], International Trade Building and [[Grand Hyatt Taipei]], all comprise one integrated business complex.\n\n==Establishment==\nThe current Taipei World Trade Center only saw completion in 1985 following many drawbacks in construction and development. However, the history of the [[Taiwan External Trade Development Council]] (TAITRA) began on 1 July 1970, where in an effort by the [[Republic of China]] Government to further develop international trade activities following accelerated economic growth in the 1970s.\n\nInitially, TAITRA did not have a specialized exhibition hall to accommodate the exhibitions of export goods. As a result of the lack of facilities, in March 1974, the [[Taipei Grand Hotel]] was chosen for the first ever [[Taipei Trade Shows]] - \"Taiwan Export Clothings Exhibition\". Subsequently, the necessity of a new exhibition hall allowed for the establishment of the TAITRA exhibition hall set up at [[Taipei Songshan Airport]]. Yet shortly afterwards due to Taiwan's rapid economic growth as one of the [[Four Asian Tigers]], TAITRA again found itself having to facilitate even larger scale exhibitions.\n\nOn 31 December 1985, the Taipei World Trade Center had its inaugural exhibition for [[IT Month]], which coincided with the opening of the Exhibition Hall. Following suit, the International Tourist Hotel (completed in 1987, renamed the [[Grand Hyatt Taipei]]), the International Trade Building (completed in 1988) and [[Taipei International Convention Center|International Convention Center]] (completed in 1989, now as TICC) were opened for use. Hence from 8 January 1990, the Taipei World Trade Center exists in its present form as an all-purpose four-in-one complex.\n\n==Main buildings==\n\n===Exhibition Building (Hall 1)===\n[[File:Computex Taipei in Taipei World Trade Center 2004-06.jpg|thumb|The exhibition hall in Taipei World Trade Center]]\n\n====Exhibition Hall====\n*First floor: Usually referred to as \"Exhibition Hall 1\". Showroom floor area is 23450 square metres, accommodates 1304 display booths, and is divided into four quadrants (A, B, C, D). Popularly, [[Taipei Trade Shows]] and other larger exhibitions are held here.\n*2nd floor: Also known as \"Area H\", has an aerial bridge that connects to [[Taipei 101]], floor area of 4789 square meters, accommodates 250 standard sized exhibition booths. Exhibitions in this area typically range from small to mid-sized local expositions or education related expositions.\n\n====Convention Room====\nLocated on the 2nd floor, divided into three rooms, mainly functions as meeting or board room for exhibition organizers, additionally, the 3rd and 4th rooms can be connected accordingly to accommodate varying delegations.\n\n====TAITRA Book Store====\n[[File:TAITRA Book Store.jpg|thumb|TAITRA Book Store]]\nOpen for business during weekdays, or on holidays when there is an exhibition. Book collection mainly comprises sales trading-related items. When [[Taipei Trade Shows]] are going on at the time, it also provides exhibitor directory lists.\n\n====Trade Market (sales display)====\nCatering to different needs, the 2nd to 6th floors are set as an \"Export Market\", with the 7th floor as the \"Import Market\".  First opened in June 1985 for product export companies to register for sales. There are currently 1052 displays.\n\n===Exhibition Hall 3===\nStart to use from 18 September 2003, showground area is 7481 square meter, able to accommodate 365 display booths, and floors above 2nd floor are planned into parking area. During large exhibition periods, the parking rate will adjust accordingly.\n\n==Important exhibitions==\n[[File:2007AutoTronicsTaipei Day4-21.jpg|thumb|Taipei Trade Shows - AutoTronics Taipei]]\n*[[Taipei International Book Exhibition]] \n*[[COMPUTEX]] \n*[[Taipei Computer Application Show]] \n*[[IT Month]] <ref>[http://www.itmonth.org.tw/ IT Month]</ref>\n*[[Taipei International Travel Fair]] <ref>[http://www.taipeiitf.org.tw/ Taipei International Travel Fair]</ref>\n*[[Taiwan External Trade Development Council|TAITRA]] [[Taiwan Trade Shows]]\n\n==Access==\nThe building is accessible from [[Taipei 101 / World Trade Center Station]] of the [[Taipei Metro]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Taipei Nangang Exhibition Center]]\n* [[Taipei 101/World Trade Center Station]]\n* [[Grand Hyatt Taipei]]\n* [[World Trade Center Taichung]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Taipei World Trade Center}}\n{{Wikinewscat|Taipei World Trade Center}}\n* {{facebook|\u81fa\u5317\u4e16\u754c\u8cbf\u6613\u4e2d\u5fc3-318898531459466}}\n*[http://www.taiwantrade.com.tw/ TAIWANTRADE]\n*[http://www.twtc.org.tw/ Taipei World Trade Center]\n*[http://www.twtcmart.com.tw/ Taipei World Trade Center Export and Import Mart]\n*[http://www.emporis.com/building/internationaltradebuilding-taipei-taiwan]\n\n{{Coord|25|2|2|N|121|33|44|E|region:ID_type:landmark|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:1985 establishments in Taiwan]]\n[[Category:Infrastructure completed in 1985]]\n[[Category:Convention centers in Taipei]]\n[[Category:Tourist attractions in Taipei]]\n[[Category:Economy of Taipei]]\n[[Category:World Trade Centers]]\n[[Category:Xinyi Special District]]\n", "text_old": "{{Expand Chinese|\u81fa\u5317\u4e16\u754c\u8cbf\u6613\u4e2d\u5fc3|date=February 2009}}\n{{Infobox building\n| name                 = Taipei World Trade Center<br>\u81fa\u5317\u4e16\u754c\u8cbf\u6613\u4e2d\u5fc3\n| native_name          = \n| former_names         =\n| alternate_names      =\n| image                = Jilong Road square of TWTC Exhibition Hall 20090617.jpg\n| alt                  = \n| caption              = Taipei World Trade Center facing [[Keelung Road|Jilong Road]]\n| map_type             = \n| map_alt              = \n| map_caption          = \n| altitude             = \n| building_type        = \n| architectural_style  = \n| structural_system    = \n| cost                 =  \n| client               = [[Taiwan External Trade Development Council]]\n| owner                = \n| current_tenants      = \n| landlord             = \n| location             = [[Xinyi District, Taipei|Xinyi]], [[Taipei]], [[Taiwan]]\n| address              = \n| coordinates          = \n| start_date           = 16 October 1982\n| completion_date      = \n| inauguration_date    = 31 December 1985\n| renovation_date      = \n| demolition_date      = \n| destruction_date     = \n| height               = \n| diameter             = \n| floor_count          = \n| floor_area           = \n| main_contractor      = \n| architect            = Haigo T.

TWTC combines every possible service that brings together a vast consulting service on trade-related issues, trading partners, [[Distributor (business)|supplier]]s, and [[Market (economics)|markets]].\n\nThis four-in-one complex, located in the city's [[Xinyi District, Taipei|Xinyi District]], is designed to accommodate the needs of the international business community, which is why there is not just one, but four structures at the TWTC. The Exhibition Hall, [[Taipei International Convention Center|International Convention Center]], International Trade Building and [[Grand Hyatt Taipei]], all comprise one integrated business complex.\n\n==Establishment==\nThe current Taipei World Trade Center only saw completion in 1985 following many drawbacks in construction and development. However, the history of the [[Taiwan External Trade Development Council]] (TAITRA) began on 1 July 1970, where in an effort by the [[Republic of China]] Government to further develop international trade activities following accelerated economic growth in the 1970s.\n\nInitially, TAITRA did not have a specialized exhibition hall to accommodate the exhibitions of export goods. As a result of the lack of facilities, in March 1974, the [[Taipei Grand Hotel]] was chosen for the first ever [[Taipei Trade Shows]] - \"Taiwan Export Clothings Exhibition\". Subsequently, the necessity of a new exhibition hall allowed for the establishment of the TAITRA exhibition hall set up at [[Taipei Songshan Airport]]. Yet shortly afterwards due to Taiwan's rapid economic growth as one of the [[Four Asian Tigers]], TAITRA again found itself having to facilitate even larger scale exhibitions.\n\nOn 31 December 1985, the Taipei World Trade Center had its inaugural exhibition for [[IT Month]], which coincided with the opening of the Exhibition Hall. Following suit, the International Tourist Hotel (completed in 1987, renamed the [[Grand Hyatt Taipei]]), the International Trade Building (completed in 1988) and [[Taipei International Convention Center|International Convention Center]] (completed in 1989, now as TICC) were opened for use. Hence from 8 January 1990, the Taipei World Trade Center exists in its present form as an all-purpose four-in-one complex.\n\n==Main buildings==\n\n===Exhibition Building (Hall 1)===\n[[File:Computex Taipei in Taipei World Trade Center 2004-06.jpg|thumb|The exhibition hall in Taipei World Trade Center]]\n\n====Exhibition Hall====\n*First floor: Usually referred to as \"Exhibition Hall 1\". Showroom floor area is 23450 square metres, accommodates 1304 display booths, and is divided into four quadrants (A, B, C, D).

Exhibitions in this area typically range from small to mid-sized local expositions or education related expositions.\n\n====Convention Room====\nLocated on the 2nd floor, divided into three rooms, mainly functions as meeting or board room for exhibition organizers, additionally, the 3rd and 4th rooms can be connected accordingly to accommodate varying delegations.\n\n====TAITRA Book Store====\n[[File:TAITRA Book Store.jpg|thumb|TAITRA Book Store]]\nOpen for business during weekdays, or on holidays when there is an exhibition. Book collection mainly comprises sales trading-related items.

First opened in June 1985 for product export companies to register for sales. There are currently 1052 displays.\n\n===Exhibition Hall 3===\nStart to use from 18 September 2003, showground area is 7481 square meter, able to accommodate 365 display booths, and floors above 2nd floor are planned into parking area.
