At [[Tullaghan]], the coastline is only {{convert|2.5|miles|km}} long.<ref>An Article on the geography/history of Leitrim http://www.libraryireland.com/Atlas/Leitrim.php</ref>  The Shannon is linked to the [[River Erne|Erne]] via the [[Shannon\u2013Erne Waterway]]. Notable lakes include:\n*[[Lough Melvin]] \n*[[Lough Allen]]\n*[[Lough Gill]] is to the northwest of [[Dromahair]]; [[Parke's Castle]] is located on the lake shore.\n*[[Belhavel Lough]] is also located in Dromahair, within the parish of Killargue.\n*[[Lough Scur]], and [[Saint John's Lough]], on the [[Shannon\u2013Erne Waterway]].\n*Other lakes include Upper [[Lough MacNean]], [[Glencar Lough]], [[Glenade Lough]], [[Garadice Lough]], [[Rinn Lough]], [[Lough Scannal]], [[Lough Erril]] and [[Lough Machugh]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Leitrim 03.jpg|thumb|220px|left|Leitrim countryside.]]\nIn ancient times Leitrim formed the western half of the [[Kingdom of Breifne]]. This region was long influenced by the O'Rourke family of [[Dromahair]], whose heraldic lion occupies the official county shield to this day. Close ties initially existed with the [[O'Reilly]] clan in the eastern half of the kingdom, however a split occurred in the 13th century and the kingdom was divided into [[East Breifne]], now [[County Cavan]], and [[West Breifne]], now County Leitrim. The [[Normans]] invaded south Leitrim in the 13th century but were defeated at the [[Battle of \u00c1th an Chip]] in 1270.\n\nMuch of the county was confiscated from its owners in 1620 and given to Villiers and [[Frederick Hamilton (soldier)|Hamilton]]. Their initial objective was to plant the county with English settlers. However, this proved unsuccessful. English Deputy [[Sir John Perrot]] had ordered the legal establishment of \"Leitrim County\" a half-century prior, in 1565. Perrott also demarcated the current county borders around 1583.\n\nLong ago Ireland was covered in woodland,{{sfn|Boate|1653|pp=120}}{{sfn|Henry|1914|pp=243}} and five great forests are traditionally said to have stood in Leitrim, with a 19th-century county survey stating- \"a hundred years ago almost the whole country was one continued, undivided forest, so that from Drumshanbo to Drumkeeran, a distance of nine or ten miles, one could travel the whole way from tree to tree by branches\".{{sfn|Correspondent|1882|pp=37}} Many of these great forests were denuded for the making of charcoal for iron works around [[Sliabh an Iarainn]].{{sfn|Boate|1653|pp=120}}  Working of the county's rich deposits of iron ore began in the 15th century and continued until the mid 18th century. Coal mining became prominent in the 19th century to the east of Lough Allen at Sliabh an Iarainn and also to the west in [[Arigna]], on the Roscommon border. The last coal mine closed in July 1990 and there is now a visitor centre.<ref>[http://www.goireland.com/leitrim/sliabh-an-iarainn-visitor-centre-attraction-mountains-id13291.htm Sliabh an Iarainn Visitor Centre] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927045408/http://www.goireland.com/leitrim/sliabh-an-iarainn-visitor-centre-attraction-mountains-id13291.htm |date=27 September 2011 }}</ref> Sandstone was also quarried in the Glenfarne region.\n\nWriting in 1791, the geographer [[Daniel Augustus Beaufort|Beaufort]] suggested the county housing population encompassed 10,026 homes with \"upwards of 50,000 inhabitants\", the primary agriculture being cattle production, and the growth of flax sustaining the linen industry.{{sfn|Beaufort|1791|pp=69}} Leitrim was first hit by the recession caused by the mechanisation of [[linen]] weaving in the 1830s and its 155,000 residents (as of the 1841 census) were ravaged by the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Famine]] and the population dropped to 112,000 by 1851. The population subsequently continued to decrease due to emigration. After many years, the wounds of such rapid population decline have finally started to heal. Agriculture improved over the last century. Leitrim now has the fastest growing population in Connacht.\n\nThe ''[[Book of Fenagh]]'' is the most famous medieval manuscript originating here. In the 19th century the poet [[John McDonald (of Dromod)]] lived in the county, and [[William Butler Yeats]] spent the turn of the twentieth century fascinated with [[Lough Allen]] and much of Leitrim. Glencar Waterfall, {{convert|11|km|0}} from Manorhamilton, inspired Yeats and is mentioned in his poem [[The Stolen Child]].\n\n==Demographics==\n[[File:Stone bridge at Drumsna.jpg|250px|thumbnail|The Stone bridge at Drumsna that connects counties Leitrim and Roscommon.]]\n*Leitrim has the fastest growing population of any county in Connacht.

This constituency existed from 1948 to 2007, but from 2007 until Sligo\u2013Leitrim was re-created in 2016, County Leitrim was divided between two constituencies: [[Roscommon\u2013South Leitrim (D\u00e1il constituency)|Roscommon\u2013South Leitrim]] and [[Sligo\u2013North Leitrim (D\u00e1il constituency)|Sligo\u2013North Leitrim]]. This proved controversial, and at the [[2007 Irish general election|2007 general election]] there was no [[Teachta D\u00e1la|TD]] elected whose domicile was in the county.\n\n==Transport==\n[[File:Carrick-on-Shannon Bridge.jpg|thumb|220px|right|Bridge in Carrick-on-Shannon.]]\n*Supplementing the local and regional road networks are the [[N15 road (Ireland)|N15]] (Sligo-Leitrim-Donegal), [[N16 road (Ireland)|N16]] (Sligo-Leitrim-Enniskillen) and [[N4 road (Ireland)|N4]] (Sligo-Leitrim-Dublin) national roads.\n*Railway stations in Leitrim on the [[Rail transport in Ireland#Dublin to Sligo|Dublin to Sligo line]] include [[Dromod]] and [[Carrick-on-Shannon]].\n*The [[Cavan and Leitrim Railway]] opened on 17 October 1887.

[[Leitrim County Council]] is the [[Local government in the Republic of Ireland|local authority]] for the county, which had a population of 32,044 according to the 2016 census.<ref name=cso2016/> The county encompasses the historic [[Gaelic Ireland|Gaelic]] territory of [[West Breifne|West Breffny]] (''Br\u00e9ifne'') corresponding to the northern part of the county,<ref>Hayward, Richard.

At [[Tullaghan]], the coastline is only {{convert|2.5|miles|km}} long.<ref>An Article on the geography/history of Leitrim http://www.libraryireland.com/Atlas/Leitrim.php</ref>  The Shannon is linked to the [[River Erne|Erne]] via the [[Shannon\u2013Erne Waterway]]. Notable lakes include:\n*[[Lough Melvin]] \n*[[Lough Allen]]\n*[[Lough Gill]] is to the northwest of [[Dromahair]]; [[Parke's Castle]] is located on the lake shore.\n*[[Belhavel Lough]] is also located in Dromahair, within the parish of Killargue.\n*[[Lough Scur]], and [[Saint John's Lough]], on the [[Shannon\u2013Erne Waterway]].\n*Other lakes include Upper [[Lough MacNean]], [[Glencar Lough]], [[Glenade Lough]], [[Garadice Lough]], [[Rinn Lough]], [[Lough Scannal]], [[Lough Erril]] and [[Lough Machugh]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Leitrim 03.jpg|thumb|220px|left|Leitrim countryside.]]\nIn ancient times Leitrim formed the western half of the [[Kingdom of Breifne]]. This region was long influenced by the O'Rourke family of [[Dromahair]], whose heraldic lion occupies the official county shield to this day. Close ties initially existed with the [[O'Reilly]] clan in the eastern half of the kingdom, however a split occurred in the 13th century and the kingdom was divided into [[East Breifne]], now [[County Cavan]], and [[West Breifne]], now County Leitrim. The [[Normans]] invaded south Leitrim in the 13th century but were defeated at the [[Battle of \u00c1th an Chip]] in 1270.\n\nMuch of the county was confiscated from its owners in 1620 and given to Villiers and [[Frederick Hamilton (soldier)|Hamilton]]. Their initial objective was to plant the county with English settlers. However, this proved unsuccessful. English Deputy [[Sir John Perrot]] had ordered the legal establishment of \"Leitrim County\" a half-century prior, in 1565. Perrott also demarcated the current county borders around 1583.\n\nLong ago Ireland was covered in woodland,{{sfn|Boate|1653|pp=120}}{{sfn|Henry|1914|pp=243}} and five great forests are traditionally said to have stood in Leitrim, with a 19th-century county survey stating- \"a hundred years ago almost the whole country was one continued, undivided forest, so that from Drumshanbo to Drumkeeran, a distance of nine or ten miles, one could travel the whole way from tree to tree by branches\".{{sfn|Correspondent|1882|pp=37}} Many of these great forests were denuded for the making of charcoal for iron works around [[Sliabh an Iarainn]].{{sfn|Boate|1653|pp=120}}  Working of the county's rich deposits of iron ore began in the 15th century and continued until the mid 18th century. Coal mining became prominent in the 19th century to the east of Lough Allen at Sliabh an Iarainn and also to the west in [[Arigna]], on the Roscommon border. The last coal mine closed in July 1990 and there is now a visitor centre.<ref>[http://www.goireland.com/leitrim/sliabh-an-iarainn-visitor-centre-attraction-mountains-id13291.htm Sliabh an Iarainn Visitor Centre] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927045408/http://www.goireland.com/leitrim/sliabh-an-iarainn-visitor-centre-attraction-mountains-id13291.htm |date=27 September 2011 }}</ref> Sandstone was also quarried in the Glenfarne region.\n\nWriting in 1791, the geographer [[Daniel Augustus Beaufort|Beaufort]] suggested the county housing population encompassed 10,026 homes with \"upwards of 50,000 inhabitants\", the primary agriculture being cattle production, and the growth of flax sustaining the linen industry.{{sfn|Beaufort|1791|pp=69}} Leitrim was first hit by the recession caused by the mechanisation of [[linen]] weaving in the 1830s and its 155,000 residents (as of the 1841 census) were ravaged by the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Famine]] and the population dropped to 112,000 by 1851. The population subsequently continued to decrease due to emigration. After many years, the wounds of such rapid population decline have finally started to heal. Agriculture improved over the last century. Leitrim now has the fastest growing population in Connacht.\n\nThe ''[[Book of Fenagh]]'' is the most famous medieval manuscript originating here. In the 19th century the poet [[John McDonald (of Dromod)]] lived in the county, and [[William Butler Yeats]] spent the turn of the twentieth century fascinated with [[Lough Allen]] and much of Leitrim. Glencar Waterfall, {{convert|11|km|0}} from Manorhamilton, inspired Yeats and is mentioned in his poem [[The Stolen Child]].\n\n==Demographics==\n[[File:Stone bridge at Drumsna.jpg|250px|thumbnail|The Stone bridge at Drumsna that connects counties Leitrim and Roscommon.]]\n*Leitrim has the fastest growing population of any county in Connacht.

The county is divided into three [[Local Electoral Area]]s for the purpose of elections:<ref name=\"ElectionsIreland\" /> [[Ballinamore]] (6 councillors), [[Carrick-on-Shannon]] (6 councillors), and [[Manorhamilton]] (6 councillors).\n\nFor elections to [[D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann]], Leitrim is in the [[Sligo\u2013Leitrim (D\u00e1il constituency)|Sligo\u2013Leitrim]] constituency. This constituency existed from 1948 to 2007, but from 2007 until Sligo\u2013Leitrim was re-created in 2016, County Leitrim was divided between two constituencies: [[Roscommon\u2013South Leitrim (D\u00e1il constituency)|Roscommon\u2013South Leitrim]] and [[Sligo\u2013North Leitrim (D\u00e1il constituency)|Sligo\u2013North Leitrim]].

It consisted of two branches, meeting at [[Ballinamore]] which connected [[Dromod]] and [[Arigna]] with [[Belturbet]]. Services carried goods, passengers and coal from around Lough Allen. Although protested, the line finally closed on 31 March 1959. A revived heritage railway centre and transport museum, with a running line has been based at Dromod since the 1990s.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://cavanandleitrim.wixsite.com/home|title=Locomotives - County Leitrim - The Cavan and Leitrim Railway|website=Home}}</ref>\n*Railway stations in Leitrim on the former [[Sligo, Leitrim and Northern Counties Railway]] (which ran between [[Sligo]] and [[Enniskillen]]) included [[Dromahair]], [[Manorhamilton]] and [[Glenfarne]].\n*The [[River Shannon|Shannon]] and [[Shannon\u2013Erne Waterway]] give access to much of Leitrim by boat.\n\n==People==\n{{category see also|People from County Leitrim}}\n*[[Margaret Haughery]] \u2013 Philanthropist, Margaret of New Orleans, known as \"the mother of the orphans\".\n*[[Katherine Lynch]] \u2013 comedian.\n*[[William Henry Drummond]] \u2013 Mohill-born Canadian poet.\n*[[John McGahern]] \u2013 award-winning Irish author and novelist.\n*[[Pat Quinn (businessman)|Pat Quinn]] \u2013 founder of ''[[Quinnsworth]]'', Ireland's first supermarket chain.\n*[[Patrick McGoohan]] \u2013 actor.\n*[[Paul Williams (media personality)|Paul Williams]] \u2013 journalist.\n*[[Se\u00e1n Mac Diarmada]] \u2013 political activist and revolutionary leader executed following the [[Easter Rising|1916 Rising]].  \n*[[Thomas Heazle Parke]] - doctor, explorer, soldier and naturalist.\n*[[Patrick Rogan (Medal of Honor)|Patrick Rogan]] \u2013 [[US Army]] soldier and [[Medal of Honor]] recipient.\n*[[James Gralton]] \u2013 Socialist activist and only Irish person ever deported from independent Ireland.\n*[[John McDonald (of Dromod)]] \u2013 19th century poet and [[Irish nationalism#Cultural nationalism|nationalist]]\n*[[Charles Reynolds (cleric)|Charles Reynolds]] \u2013 posthumously [[Attainder|attainted]] of treason for convincing the Pope to excommunicate [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]].\n*[[Robert Strawbridge]],  American Methodist preacher born at Drumsna.\n*[[Eleanor Shanley]] \u2013 Singer\n*[[Gordon Wilson (peace campaigner)|Gordon Wilson]], peace campaigner and Irish senator\n* Seamus O'Rourke \u2013 award-winning actor, writer, director and producer of award-winning plays such as Victor's Dung and Padraig Pott's Guide to Walking.\n*[[John Godley, 3rd Baron Kilbracken|John Godley]], 3rd Baron Kilbracken\n*[[Victor Costello]], Ireland rugby international and Olympian, was a former resident of Keshcarrigan.\n*[[Turlough Carolan]] \u2013 harpist.\n*[[Carole Coleman]], [[Raidi\u00f3 Teilif\u00eds \u00c9ireann]] broadcaster.\n*[[William Lendrim]], [[Victoria Cross]] recipient.\n*[[John Willoughby Crawford]] QC (1817\u20131875), [[Lieutenant-Governor of Ontario]] (1873\u201375).\n*[[Charles Irwin]] VC (1824 \u2013\u00a0April 8, 1873),  [[Ireland|Irish]] recipient of the [[Victoria Cross]]\n*[[Charlie McGettigan]] Singer songwriter and Eurovision winner has been a Drumshanbo resident since 1973.\n*[[Paschal Mooney]] [[RT\u00c9]] broadcaster and former member of [[Seanad \u00c9ireann]]\n*[[Colm O'Rourke]] \u2013 retired Gaelic footballer and current sports broadcaster is originally from Aughavas.\n*[[Ray O'Rourke (businessman)]] \u2013 chairman and CEO of the construction multinational Laing O'Rourke\n\n==Civil Parishes==\n* [[Kiltoghert]]\n* [[Fenagh, County Leitrim|Fenagh]]\n* [[Cloone]]\n* [[Mohill]]\n\n==See also==\n* [[Muintir Eolais]]\n* [[Kingdom of Breifne]]\n* [[Lord Lieutenant of Leitrim]]\n* [[High Sheriff of Leitrim]]\n* [[Wild Atlantic Way]]\n\n==References and notes==\n\n===Notes===\n{{Reflist|82em|group=n}}\n\n===Primary references===\n{{Reflist|42em}}\n\n===Secondary sources===\n\n====Historical====\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{cite book\n|title=Irelands Naturall History\n|last=Boate\n|first=Gerard\n|year=1652\n|edition=Digitized 2009\n|publisher=Samuell Hartlib, For the Common Good of Ireland, and more especially, for the benefit of the Adventurers and Planters therein; Imprinted at London for John Wright at the Kings Head, in the Old Bayley\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KpY9AAAAcAAJ\n|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite journal\n|title=Woods and Trees of Ireland\n|volume=Journal of the County Louth Archaeological Society Vol. 3, No. 3 (Dec)\n|year=1914\n|pages=237\u2013245\n|last=Henry\n|publisher=County Louth Archaeological and History Society\n|jstor=27728012\n|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book\n|title=The Timber, Woollen, and Pottery Industries of Ireland, review of paper by G.

It shows an episode in the life of Anne ([[Juliette Binoche]]), a journalist in [[Paris, France|Paris]] for French [[Elle (magazine)|''Elle'']] who is writing an article about female student [[prostitution]].\n\nAlthough the young women are not keen on publicity, she persuades two students to talk to her: the provocative Alicja ([[Joanna Kulig]]), an ambitious economics student who left Poland to further her education; and the subtle Charlotte ([[Ana\u00efs Demoustier]]), enrolled in a Parisian ''classe pr\u00e9paratoire'', determined to leave her modest provincial background behind.\n\nWhere Anne is expecting misery and distress, she discovers freedom, pride, and empowerment. As Anne's professional curiosity in the two women becomes a matter of personal interest, she starts to rediscover her own sexuality.\n\n''Elles'' premiered at the [[2011 Toronto International Film Festival]] and first entered general release in France in February 2012.\n\n== Plot ==\nThe film is set during the course of one day. Anne ([[Juliette Binoche]]) is trying to meet the deadline for her article about prostitution, while shopping and preparing dinner for her husband's boss and his wife. She is also worried about her two sons, the eldest of whom has been skipping classes while the younger appears to start being hooked on video games. This narrative is interrupted by the flashbacks to the conversations Anne has had with the two students, scenes from their lives, and the effect that their work in the sex industry is having on them and those close to them.\n\nAnne interviews Alicja ([[Joanna Kulig]]), arriving from Poland to study in France, she not only lost her suitcase but found the student advisors to be less than helpful in her hour of need. Another student came to her rescue, but admitted that his generosity was part of the courtship. By the time we see her being interviewed by Anne, Alicja has earned enough to have a very nice apartment along with designer clothes and handbags. She is much more hedonistic than Charlotte and proceeds to get Anne drunk during the course of the interview in her apartment. When asked who her clients are, Alicja simply replies that they are bored husbands. For Alicja, being alone in a foreign country has led her to seemingly much more freedom than she enjoyed at home, but when asked if she wanted to stop, she admits that there is an element of addiction with the way she earns money. \n\nCharlotte ([[Ana\u00efs Demoustier]]) is quite a different person, she seems very relaxed about the sex she has with her clients. She has tried doing part-time work but found that her studies suffered so she turned to prostitution. But she still does the occasional shift as she needs to be able to explain to her family and boyfriend where the money comes from. These sexual encounters inevitably lead to conflict in her relationship with her boyfriend who at one point demands to know if she is seeing someone else. Her friendly, girl-next-door nature leads her clients to confide in her about their lives \u2013 their jobs, their wives \u2013 which has surprised Charlotte as she had imagined the work would have been non-stop sex. \n\nHow the students' lives turn out is left to the viewer to decide, with the end of the film focusing more on Anne's life and the effect these encounters with the two students have had on her and her relationship with her husband.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Malgoska Szumowska Juliette Binoche 2012.jpg|thumb|right|Ma\u0142gorzata Szumowska and Juliette Binoche at the film premiere.]]\n\n* [[Juliette Binoche]] as Anne\n* [[Ana\u00efs Demoustier]] as Charlotte\n* [[Joanna Kulig]] as Alicja\n* [[Krystyna Janda]] as Alicja's mother\n* [[Louis-Do de Lencquesaing]] as Patrick\n* [[Andrzej Chyra]] as Sadist client\n* [[Ali Marhyar]] as Sa\u00efd\n* [[Jean-Marie Binoche]] as Anne's father\n* [[Fran\u00e7ois Civil]] as Florent (Anne and Patrick's older son)\n* [[Pablo Beugnet]] as St\u00e9phane (Anne and Patrick's younger son)\n* {{ill|Val\u00e9rie Dr\u00e9ville|fr}} as Charlotte's mother\n* {{ill|Jean-Louis Coulloc'h|fr}} as Charlotte's father\n* [[Arthur Moncia]] as Thomas\n* [[Scali Delpeyrat]] as Charles\n* [[Laurence Ragon]] as Colette\n* [[Alain Libolt]] as Colette's husband\n* [[Florence Loiret Caille]] as Rita\n* [[Swann Arlaud]] as Young client\n* [[Nicolas Layani]] as Guitar client\n\n==MPAA rating==\nThe film was originally rated NC-17 in the US as a result of explicit sexual content,<ref>{{cite web|title=Elles|publisher=The New York Times|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/2012/04/27/movies/elles-with-juliette-binoche-about-prostitution.html|accessdate=December 15, 2012}}</ref> but this rating was later surrendered<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://filmratings.com/Search?filmTitle=elles&x=16&y=4|title=Elles-Filmratings|date=20 May 2018|website=MPAA|access-date=20 May 2018}}</ref>.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of French films]]\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|1549589|Elles}}\n\n\n[[Category:2011 films]]\n[[Category:German films]]\n[[Category:French films]]\n[[Category:2010s erotic films]]\n[[Category:Films set in Paris]]\n[[Category:French independent films]]\n[[Category:Polish films]]\n[[Category:French-language films]]\n[[Category:Polish-language films]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Cologne (Germany)]]\n[[Category:German independent films]]\n[[Category:French erotic films]]\n[[Category:French multilingual films]]\n[[Category:Polish multilingual films]]\n[[Category:German erotic films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Ma\u0142gorzata Szumowska]]\n[[Category:Films about prostitution in Paris]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|2011 film by Ma\u0142gorzata Szumowska}}\n{{distinguish|Elle (film)}}\n{{Infobox film\n| name = Elles\n| image = Elles2011Poster.jpg\n| caption = Film poster\n| director = [[Ma\u0142goska Szumowska]] <!-- name per film's credits and some versions of the poster: http://www.impawards.com/intl/misc/2012/elles_ver4_xlg.html (in other versions of the poster she is credited as \u201cMalgoska Szumowska\u201d) -->\n| starring = {{plainlist |\n* [[Juliette Binoche]]\n* [[Ana\u00efs Demoustier]]\n* [[Joanna Kulig]]\n}}\n| producer = [[Marianne Slot]]\n| writer = {{plainlist |\n* [[Tine Byrckel]]\n* Ma\u0142goska Szumowska <!-- Byrckel is first billed in the credits -->\n}}\n| released = {{Film date|df=y|2011|9|9|[[Toronto International Film Festival|TIFF]]|2012|2|1|France|2012|2|17|Poland|2012|3|29|Germany}}\n| music          = [[Pawe\u0142 Mykietyn]]\n| cinematography = Micha\u0142 Englert \n| editing        = Fran\u00e7oise Tourmen<br>Jacek Drosio\n| country = {{plainlist |\n* France\n* Poland\n* Germany\n}}\n| language = {{plainlist |\n* French\n* Polish\n}}\n| runtime = 92 minutes\n| distributor = [[Memento Films]]\n| budget = $4 million <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jpbox-office.com/fichfilm.php?id=12467|title=Elles (2012) (2012) - JPBox-Office|website=www.jpbox-office.com}}</ref>\n| gross = $3.8 million <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=intl&id=elles.htm|title=Elles (2012) - International Box Office Results - Box Office Mojo|website=www.boxofficemojo.com}}</ref>\n}}\n\n'''''Elles''''' is a 2011 European film, directed and co-written by Polish director [[Ma\u0142goska Szumowska]].

Her friendly, girl-next-door nature leads her clients to confide in her about their lives \u2013 their jobs, their wives \u2013 which has surprised Charlotte as she had imagined the work would have been non-stop sex. \n\nHow the students' lives turn out is left to the viewer to decide, with the end of the film focusing more on Anne's life and the effect these encounters with the two students have had on her and her relationship with her husband.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Malgoska Szumowska Juliette Binoche 2012.jpg|thumb|right|Ma\u0142gorzata Szumowska and Juliette Binoche at the film premiere.]]\n\n* [[Juliette Binoche]] as Anne\n* [[Ana\u00efs Demoustier]] as Charlotte\n* [[Joanna Kulig]] as Alicja\n* [[Krystyna Janda]] as Alicja's mother\n* [[Louis-Do de Lencquesaing]] as Patrick\n* [[Andrzej Chyra]] as Sadist client\n* [[Ali Marhyar]] as Sa\u00efd\n* [[Jean-Marie Binoche]] as Anne's father\n* [[Fran\u00e7ois Civil]] as Florent (Anne and Patrick's older son)\n* [[Pablo Beugnet]] as St\u00e9phane (Anne and Patrick's younger son)\n* {{ill|Val\u00e9rie Dr\u00e9ville|fr}} as Charlotte's mother\n* {{ill|Jean-Louis Coulloc'h|fr}} as Charlotte's father\n* [[Arthur Moncia]] as Thomas\n* [[Scali Delpeyrat]] as Charles\n* [[Laurence Ragon]] as Colette\n* [[Alain Libolt]] as Colette's husband\n* [[Florence Loiret Caille]] as Rita\n* [[Swann Arlaud]] as Young client\n* [[Nicolas Layani]] as Guitar client\n\n==MPAA rating==\nThe film was originally rated NC-17 in the US as a result of explicit sexual content,<ref>{{cite web|title=Elles|publisher=The New York Times|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/2012/04/27/movies/elles-with-juliette-binoche-about-prostitution.html|accessdate=December 15, 2012}}</ref> but this rating was later surrendered<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://filmratings.com/Search?filmTitle=elles&x=16&y=4|title=Elles-Filmratings|date=20 May 2018|website=MPAA|access-date=20 May 2018}}</ref>.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of French films]]\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|1549589|Elles}}\n\n\n[[Category:2011 films]]\n[[Category:German films]]\n[[Category:French films]]\n[[Category:2010s erotic films]]\n[[Category:Films set in Paris]]\n[[Category:French independent films]]\n[[Category:Polish films]]\n[[Category:French-language films]]\n[[Category:Polish-language films]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Cologne (Germany)]]\n[[Category:German independent films]]\n[[Category:French erotic films]]\n[[Category:French multilingual films]]\n[[Category:Polish multilingual films]]\n[[Category:German erotic films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Ma\u0142gorzata Szumowska]]\n[[Category:Films about prostitution in Paris]]\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200etop:Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: \u2019s \u2192 's", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elles_(film)"}

{"title_page": "Madelonnettes Convent", "text_new": "{{short description|Convent located in Paris, in France}}\n{{no footnotes|date=May 2014}}\n[[File:Boilly Prison des Madelonnettes, 1805.png|thumb|[[Louis-L\u00e9opold Boilly]]'s ''La Prison des Madelonnettes'' (1805)]]\nThe '''Madelonnettes Convent''' (''couvent des Madelonnettes'') was a Paris convent in the [[3rd arrondissement of Paris]].  It was located in what is now a rectangle between 6 rue des Fontaines du Temple (where there are the remains of one of its walls), rue Volta and rue du Vertbois, and part of its site is now occupied by the lyc\u00e9e Turgot.  As the '''Madelonnettes Prison''' (''prison des Madelonnettes'') during the [[French Revolution]], its prisoners included the writers the [[Marquis de Sade]]{{sfn|Gear|1963|p=132}} and [[Nicolas Chamfort]], the politician [[Jean-Baptiste de Machault d'Arnouville]]{{sfn|de Chateaubriand|1902|p=181}} and the actor [[Dazincourt]].\n\n==Convent==\n===Origins===\n[[File:1652 Gomboust Map of Paris, Couvent des Madelonnettes.png|thumb|The Convent on [[Jacques Gomboust]]'s 1652 map of Paris]]\nIts origins date back to 1618, when the wine merchant Robert de Montry - after being rebuffed by the local prostitutes in his attempts to reform them - finally decided to put them back to the right path whilst being accommodated in his own home.  With the aid of M. Du Pont (cur\u00e9 of Saint-Nicolas des Champs), the [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchin]] Father Athanase Mol\u00e9 and M. de Fresne (an officer of the Gardes du Corps du Roi and a friend of [[Saint Vincent de Paul]] among others), Montry worked to spread his charitable work to other prostitutes.  Quickly overtaken by their success, at first they rented rooms in the ''faubourg Saint-Honor\u00e9'', before Robert de Montry lent them a house he owned in the ''quartier de la Croix-Rouge''.  A chapel for the house was improvised, served by Benedictines from ''[[Saint-Germain des Pr\u00e9s]]''.\n\nThe idea of creating an actual convent was down to the patronage of Saint-Vincent-de-Paul and the generosity of the Marquise de Maignelay (n\u00e9e Claude-Marguerite de [[Gondi (family)|Gondi]], sister of [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois de Gondi]], [[archbishop of Paris]]), who, on 16 July 1620, acquired from sister Dubuisson  a property in ''rue des Fontaines'', between the ''Abbaye Saint-Martin des Champs'' and the ''Temple'' fortress enclosure, and left them 101,600 [[French livres|livres]] in her will.  In 1625, [[Louis XIII]] granted them 3,000 livres in rents, and they were accorded a constitution by [[pope Urban VIII]] in 1630].  Most of the buildings were constructed in 1637, with the first chapel inaugurated by [[Anne of Austria]] on 22 March 1648 and a church built from 1680 onwards and consecrated on 2 September 1685.\n\n===History===\n[[File:Vestigemadelonnettes.JPG|thumb|upright|The site today]]\nThis large gathering of \"sinners\" freely choosing the way of redemption slowly evolved into a more classical convent establishment in which women or girls suspected of misconduct would be confined on the orders of the king, judges or even just at their family's request, the most famous example being the courtesan [[Ninon de l'Enclos]], imprisoned there in 1657 at the request of Anne of Austria, now queen-mother (though according to [[G\u00e9d\u00e9on Tallemant des R\u00e9aux]], Ninon did not remain there long, so strong was the pressure of her  gallants that gathered around the convent to demand her release).  A number of them came from rich families who provided the convent with a large pension.  It was thus necessary therefore to strengthen the supervision, which was confided in turn to four sisters of the ''Visitation of Saint-Antoine'' (1629\u20131677), the [[Ursulines]] (1677\u20131720) and finally to the nuns of Saint-Michel (1720 onwards), renowned for their severity.{{sfn|Botteghe oscure|pp=255-265}}{{sfn|Cohen|1970|pp=156=159}}\n\nThe convent at its peak housed 165 ''pensionnaires'', organized in three orders, each with a separate building:  \n* the actual sisters of ''Sainte Madeleine'', after taking their solemn vows, white habit;\n* the sisters of ''Saint' Marthe'', after taking their basic vows, grey habit - these could move up to the order of ''Sainte Madeleine'' after two years in the novitiate ;\n* the sisters of Saint Lazare, who had taken no vows and were generally held here against their will, in secular dress but with their face concealed by a black [[taffeta]] veil.\n\n==Prison==\n===French Revolution===\nAfter the decree of the [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National Assembly]] of 13 February 1790 abolishing convents, a last inventory of the convent's goods and income was carried out on 17 March that same year.  Though the convent officially closed in 1790, the nuns were only dispersed by stages, since a new mother-superior and bursar were named on 21 March 1791.  \n\nIn the face of a new wave of imprisonments, in 1793 the convent buildings were converted into a prison for political prisoners and common criminals, with its first prisoners arriving on 4 April under the direction of the ''commissaire'' Marino and the ''concierge'' Vaubertrand.  The tempo of arrests quickened from May 1793 (up to 47 a day) and this led to overcrowding, with a prison only originally meant for 200 people housing up to 319 by 27 [[Messidor]], crammed into cells only {{convert|5|sqft|m2|adj=on}} each.  Common criminals, nicknamed \"les pailleux\", were held on the ground floor, with people of varying origins referred to as \"suspects\".  Despite the crowded conditions, the mood was good, with improvised poems, singing, music-making and gymnastics, all under the jailors' eyes, but despite this, the prison regime was hard and insanitary.  Commissaire Marino forbade prisoners to go into the courtyard, under the pretext that their detention was only provisional whilst they were awaiting transfer to another location.

It was located in what is now a rectangle between 6 rue des Fontaines du Temple (where there are the remains of one of its walls), rue Volta and rue du Vertbois, and part of its site is now occupied by the lyc\u00e9e Turgot.  As the '''Madelonnettes Prison''' (''prison des Madelonnettes'') during the [[French Revolution]], its prisoners included the writers the [[Marquis de Sade]]{{sfn|Gear|1963|p=132}} and [[Nicolas Chamfort]], the politician [[Jean-Baptiste de Machault d'Arnouville]]{{sfn|de Chateaubriand|1902|p=181}} and the actor [[Dazincourt]].\n\n==Convent==\n===Origins===\n[[File:1652 Gomboust Map of Paris, Couvent des Madelonnettes.png|thumb|The Convent on [[Jacques Gomboust]]'s 1652 map of Paris]]\nIts origins date back to 1618, when the wine merchant Robert de Montry - after being rebuffed by the local prostitutes in his attempts to reform them - finally decided to put them back to the right path whilst being accommodated in his own home.  With the aid of M. Du Pont (cur\u00e9 of Saint-Nicolas des Champs), the [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchin]] Father Athanase Mol\u00e9 and M. de Fresne (an officer of the Gardes du Corps du Roi and a friend of [[Saint Vincent de Paul]] among others), Montry worked to spread his charitable work to other prostitutes.  Quickly overtaken by their success, at first they rented rooms in the ''faubourg Saint-Honor\u00e9'', before Robert de Montry lent them a house he owned in the ''quartier de la Croix-Rouge''.  A chapel for the house was improvised, served by Benedictines from ''[[Saint-Germain des Pr\u00e9s]]''.\n\nThe idea of creating an actual convent was down to the patronage of Saint-Vincent-de-Paul and the generosity of the Marquise de Maignelay (n\u00e9e Claude-Marguerite de [[Gondi (family)|Gondi]], sister of [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois de Gondi]], [[archbishop of Paris]]), who, on 16 July 1620, acquired from sister Dubuisson  a property in ''rue des Fontaines'', between the ''Abbaye Saint-Martin des Champs'' and the ''Temple'' fortress enclosure, and left them 101,600 [[French livres|livres]] in her will.  In 1625, [[Louis XIII]] granted them 3,000 livres in rents, and they were accorded a constitution by [[pope Urban VIII]] in 1630].  Most of the buildings were constructed in 1637, with the first chapel inaugurated by [[Anne of Austria]] on 22 March 1648 and a church built from 1680 onwards and consecrated on 2 September 1685.\n\n===History===\n[[File:Vestigemadelonnettes.JPG|thumb|upright|The site today]]\nThis large gathering of \"sinners\" freely choosing the way of redemption slowly evolved into a more classical convent establishment in which women or girls suspected of misconduct would be confined on the orders of the king, judges or even just at their family's request, the most famous example being the courtesan [[Ninon de l'Enclos]], imprisoned there in 1657 at the request of Anne of Austria, now queen-mother (though according to [[G\u00e9d\u00e9on Tallemant des R\u00e9aux]], Ninon did not remain there long, so strong was the pressure of her  gallants that gathered around the convent to demand her release).  A number of them came from rich families who provided the convent with a large pension.  It was thus necessary therefore to strengthen the supervision, which was confided in turn to four sisters of the ''Visitation of Saint-Antoine'' (1629\u20131677), the [[Ursulines]] (1677\u20131720) and finally to the nuns of Saint-Michel (1720 onwards), renowned for their severity.{{sfn|Botteghe oscure|pp=255-265}}{{sfn|Cohen|1970|pp=156=159}}\n\nThe convent at its peak housed 165 ''pensionnaires'', organized in three orders, each with a separate building:  \n* the actual sisters of ''Sainte Madeleine'', after taking their solemn vows, white habit;\n* the sisters of ''Saint' Marthe'', after taking their basic vows, grey habit - these could move up to the order of ''Sainte Madeleine'' after two years in the novitiate ;\n* the sisters of Saint Lazare, who had taken no vows and were generally held here against their will, in secular dress but with their face concealed by a black [[taffeta]] veil.\n\n==Prison==\n===French Revolution===\nAfter the decree of the [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National Assembly]] of 13 February 1790 abolishing convents, a last inventory of the convent's goods and income was carried out on 17 March that same year.  Though the convent officially closed in 1790, the nuns were only dispersed by stages, since a new mother-superior and bursar were named on 21 March 1791.  \n\nIn the face of a new wave of imprisonments, in 1793 the convent buildings were converted into a prison for political prisoners and common criminals, with its first prisoners arriving on 4 April under the direction of the ''commissaire'' Marino and the ''concierge'' Vaubertrand.  The tempo of arrests quickened from May 1793 (up to 47 a day) and this led to overcrowding, with a prison only originally meant for 200 people housing up to 319 by 27 [[Messidor]], crammed into cells only {{convert|5|sqft|m2|adj=on}} each.  Common criminals, nicknamed \"les pailleux\", were held on the ground floor, with people of varying origins referred to as \"suspects\".  Despite the crowded conditions, the mood was good, with improvised poems, singing, music-making and gymnastics, all under the jailors' eyes, but despite this, the prison regime was hard and insanitary.  Commissaire Marino forbade prisoners to go into the courtyard, under the pretext that their detention was only provisional whilst they were awaiting transfer to another location.  Promiscuity favoured the spread of infectious diseases such as [[smallpox]], which claimed several victims.\n\nAt the end of December 1793, the political prisoners were moved to (among others) the [[Abbaye de Port-Royal de Paris|Port-Libre]], [[Coignard|Picpus]], and [[Prison Saint-Lazare|Saint-Lazare]] prisons, and the common criminals were sent to [[Bic\u00eatre]].  Little by little the ''Madelonnettes'' was emptied of prisoners after the events of [[Thermidor]], and it reopened in 1795 as a women's prison for female criminals and debtors and young women shut up for correction by their fathers (as an annex to the [[prison Saint Lazare]]).
