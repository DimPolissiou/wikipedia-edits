In this scenario, energy can be harvested from acetyl-CoA through ketone production.\n\nIn ketogenesis, two acetyl-CoA molecules condense to form [[acetoacetyl-CoA]] via [[thiolase]]. Acetoacetyl-CoA briefly combines with another acetyl-CoA via [[Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA synthase|HMG-CoA synthase]] to form [[HMG-CoA|hydroxy-\u03b2-methylglutaryl-CoA]].

Alternatively, acetoacetate can spontaneously degrade to a third ketone body (acetone) and [[carbon dioxide]], which generates much greater concentrations of acetoacetate and D-\u03b2-hydroxybutyrate. The resulting ketone bodies cannot be used for energy by the liver so are exported from the liver to supply energy to the brain and peripheral tissues. \n\nIn addition to fatty acids, deaminated [[ketogenic amino acids]] can also be converted into intermediates in the citric acid cycle and produce ketone bodies.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==Measurement==\nKetone levels can be measured by testing urine, blood or breath.

The son of the admiral [[Errol Manners|Sir Errol Manners]], he had a distinguished naval career which spanned from 1932\u20131958. He served in the [[Second World War]] and held a number of commands, in addition to earning the [[Distinguished Service Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Service Cross]] for his role in the sinking of the [[German submarine U-1274|German submarine ''U-1274'']] in April 1945 while commanding officer aboard {{HMS|Viceroy|D91|6}}.\n\nAs a [[first-class cricket]]er, Manners was a hard-hitting right-handed batsman and a right-arm [[Seam bowling|medium pace bowler]]. He began his playing career with [[Hampshire County Cricket Club|Hampshire]] in 1936, but found his availability limited due to his commitments as a naval officer. With his first-class career further interrupted by the war, Manners returned to first-class cricket in 1947 after securing a shore based position at [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst|Sandhurst]]. He played [[county cricket]] for Hampshire in 1947 and 1948, but played the majority of his first-class cricket after the war for the [[Combined Services cricket team]]. He scored over 1,000 runs in his first-class career, which included four centuries.\n\nIn September 2018, he became the [[Lists of oldest cricketers#Longest-lived first-class cricketers|longest-lived first-class cricketer]], surpassing the previous record of 103 years and 344 days held by [[Jim Hutchinson]], having been the oldest living first-class cricketer since September 2014.\n\n==Early life==\nThe son of the [[Royal Navy]] admiral and theologian [[Errol Manners|Sir Errol Manners]] (1883-1953) and his wife, Florence Maud Harrison (1883-1967), he was born at [[Exeter]] in September 1914.<ref name=\"TIMES\">{{cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/lieutenant-commander-john-manners-obituary-pwm9ntwlb |title=Lieutenant-Commander John Manners obituary |date=2020-03-16 |work=[[The Times]] |accessdate=2020-03-18 |url-access=subscription}}</ref> He was descended from [[John Manners, 2nd Duke of Rutland]].<ref name=\"OBIT\">{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/obituaries/2020/03/09/lieutenant-commander-john-manners-naval-officer-sank-u-boat/ |title=Lieutenant Commander John Manners, naval officer who sank a U-boat and played cricket for Hampshire \u2013 obituary |date=2019-03-09 |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |accessdate=2019-03-15 |url-access=subscription}}</ref> He was educated at Ferndown School,<ref name=\"IND\">{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/john-manners-death-cricket-royal-navy-second-world-war-a9408856.html |title=John Manners: Naval war hero and world\u2019s oldest former first-class cricketer |first=Kenneth |last=Shenton |date=2020-03-27 |work=[[The Independent]] |accessdate=2020-03-31}}</ref> before attending [[Britannia Royal Naval College|Dartmouth College]] as a cadet from the age of 13, following in a family tradition of attending the college.<ref name=\"UNIT\"/><ref name=\"ESPN\">{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.co.uk/cricket/story/_/id/24602746/john-manners-former-hampshire-batsman-becomes-oldest-living-first-class-cricketer |title=John Manners, former Hampshire batsman, becomes oldest living first-class cricketer |publisher=ESPNcricinfo |accessdate=2018-09-13}}</ref> His time as a cadet saw him visit the [[British West Indies|West Indies]] and appear for the college in the schools' match at [[Lord's]] in 1930.<ref name=\"OBIT\"/>\n\n==Early naval and cricket career==\nHe was commissioned as a [[midshipman]] in the Royal Navy in September 1932, before being made an acting-[[sub-lieutenant]] in January 1935.

The son of the admiral [[Errol Manners|Sir Errol Manners]], he had a distinguished naval career which spanned from 1932\u20131958. He served in the [[Second World War]] and held a number of commands, in addition to earning the [[Distinguished Service Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Service Cross]] for his role in the sinking of the [[German submarine U-1274|German submarine ''U-1274'']] in April 1945 while commanding officer aboard {{HMS|Viceroy|D91|6}}.\n\nAs a [[first-class cricket]]er, Manners was a hard-hitting right-handed batsman and a right-arm [[Seam bowling|medium pace bowler]]. He began his playing career with [[Hampshire County Cricket Club|Hampshire]] in 1936, but found his availability limited due to his commitments as a naval officer. With his first-class career further interrupted by the war, Manners returned to first-class cricket in 1947 after securing a shore based position at [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst|Sandhurst]]. He played [[county cricket]] for Hampshire in 1947 and 1948, but played the majority of his first-class cricket after the war for the [[Combined Services cricket team]].

Based on extensive qualitative fieldwork conducted from 2014 to 2016 with coltan buyers operating in [[Bukama Territory]], [[Kalemie]] and [[Lubumbashi]], [[Katanga Province]], one researcher suggested that conflict mineral reforms resulted in better oversight and organization of supply chains, but that inaction by the Congolese government had led to locally negotiated solutions and territorialization which obscure access criteria.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n|journal=The Extractive Industries and Society\n|volume=5\n|issue=1\n|pages=56\u201365\n|date=12 February 2018\n|title=Authority and access to the cassiterite and coltan trade in Bukama Territory (DRC)\n|doi=10.1016/j.exis.2017.12.001\n|last1=Diemel\n|first1=J.A.\n}}\n</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"font-size:8pt\"\n|+ Metric tons of tantalum mined\n|- style=\"font-size:8pt\"\n|  style=\"height:11px; text-align:center;\"| &nbsp;\n!  style=\"text-align:right;\" | 1990\n!  style=\"text-align:right;\" | 1991\n!  style=\"text-align:right;\" | 1992\n!  style=\"text-align:right;\" | 1993\n!  style=\"text-align:right;\" | 1994\n!  style=\"text-align:right;\" | 1995\n!  style=\"text-align:right;\" | 1996\n!  style=\"text-align:right;\" | 1997\n!  style=\"text-align:right;\" | 1998\n!  style=\"text-align:right;\" | 1999\n!  style=\"text-align:right;\" | 2000\n!  style=\"text-align:right;\" | 2001\n!  style=\"text-align:right;\" | 2002\n!  style=\"text-align:right;\" | 2003\n!  style=\"text-align:right;\" | 2004\n!  style=\"text-align:right;\" | 2005\n!  style=\"text-align:right;\" | 2006\n!  style=\"text-align:right;\" | 2007\n!  style=\"text-align:right;\" | 2008\n!  style=\"text-align:right;\" | 2009\n!  style=\"text-align:right;\" | 2010\n!  style=\"text-align:right;\" | 2011\n!  style=\"text-align:right;\" | 2012\n!  style=\"text-align:right;\" | 2013\n|- style=\"font-size:8pt\"\n! style=\"height:11px;\"| Australia\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 165\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 218\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 224\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 170\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 238\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 274\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 276\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 302\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 330\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 350\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 485\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 660\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 940\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 765\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 807\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 854\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 478\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 441\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 557\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 81\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 0\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 80\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 0\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 0\n|- style=\"font-size:8pt\"\n! style=\"height:11px;\"| Brazil\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 90\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 84\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 60\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 50\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 50\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 50\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 55\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 55\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 310\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 165\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 190\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 210\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 200\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 200\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 213\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 216\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 176\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 180\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 180\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 180\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 180\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 180\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 140\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 140\n|- style=\"font-size:8pt\"\n! style=\"height:11px;\"| Canada\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 86\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 93\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 48\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 25\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 36\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 33\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 55\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 49\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 57\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 54\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 57\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 77\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 58\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 55\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 57\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 63\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 56\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 45\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 40\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 25\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 0\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 25\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 50\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 50\n|- style=\"font-size:8pt\"\n! style=\"height:11px;\"| D.R.
