Known alternately as the Holy Scrinium or the Chartarium, it normally travelled with the current pope.<ref name=ambrosini/> The vast majority of these documents are now lost, but we know of them through references in contemporary and later works. \n\nIn later centuries, as the Church amassed power, popes would visit heads of state to negotiate treaties or make political appearances around Europe. Popes would also have multiple places of residency. When they travelled for diplomatic or other purposes, they would take their archives with them, since they needed it for administrative work. This resulted in some loss of items.<ref name=ambrosini/>\n\nInitially, the archival materials of the Church were stored at the [[Lateran Palace]], then the official papal residence.<ref name=ambrosini/>\n\n=== Uprisings, revolts, and the Western Schism (1085{{endash}}1415) ===\nBy the 11th century, the archives of the church were devolved to at least three separate sites: the Lateran, [[Old St. Peter's Basilica|St. Peter's Basilica]], and the Palatine palace.<ref name=ambrosini/> Between the 11th and the 13th centuries, a large part of these archives disappeared. \n\nWhen the Popes moved to [[Avignon Papacy|Avignon]], the process of transporting their archives took twenty years, all told. The various places where the archives were kept along the way were sacked by the [[Guelphs and Ghibellines|Ghibellines]] three separate times, in 1314, 1319, and 1320.<ref name=ambrosini>{{Cite book|title=The Secret Archives of the Vatican|last=Ambrosini|first=Maria Luisa|date=1969|publisher=Little, Brown, & Co.|isbn=0760701253|location=Boston|pages=16, 27, 134 | oclc=35364715|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=0Cc9A9_DIQ4C&pg=PA16& |access-date = 7 November 2019}}</ref>\n\n[[Antipope]]s also had their own archives. [[Western Schism|The Western Schism]] resulted in two sets of papal archives being developed at once; this rose to three during the era of Pisan antipope [[Antipope John XXIII|John XXIII]].<ref name=ambrosini/> The disparate archives of the rival papal claimants were not fully reunited in the Vatican's archives until 1784.<ref name=ambrosini/>\n\nDuring the 1404 sack of the Vatican, papal registers and historical documents were thrown into the streets, and [[Pope Innocent VII]] fled the city. His successor, [[Pope Gregory XII]], supposedly sold off a large number of archival materials in 1406, including some of the papal registers.<ref name=ambrosini />\n\n=== Founding the archive ===\nIn 1612, [[Pope Paul V]] ordered all Church records assembled in one place.<ref name=ambrosini/>\n\n== French seizure and restoration ==\n\nAs [[Napoleon]] conquered the states on the Italian peninsula in the 1790s, he demanded works of art and manuscripts as tribute. His armistice with Holy See on 23 June 1796 stipulated that \"the Pope shall deliver to the French Republic one hundred pictures, busts, vases or statues ... and five hundred manuscripts\" all chosen by French agents. The 1798 [[Treaty of Tolentino]] made even greater demands and the works sent to Paris included the [[Codex Vaticanus]], the oldest extant manuscript of the Bible in Greek. By the time Napoleon became emperor in 1804, he envisaged a central archive in Paris of the records and treasures of Europe.

Known alternately as the Holy Scrinium or the Chartarium, it normally travelled with the current pope.<ref name=ambrosini/> The vast majority of these documents are now lost, but we know of them through references in contemporary and later works. \n\nIn later centuries, as the Church amassed power, popes would visit heads of state to negotiate treaties or make political appearances around Europe. Popes would also have multiple places of residency. When they travelled for diplomatic or other purposes, they would take their archives with them, since they needed it for administrative work. This resulted in some loss of items.<ref name=ambrosini/>\n\nInitially, the archival materials of the Church were stored at the [[Lateran Palace]], then the official papal residence.<ref name=ambrosini/>\n\n=== Uprisings, revolts, and the Western Schism (1085{{endash}}1415) ===\nBy the 11th century, the archives of the church were devolved to at least three separate sites: the Lateran, [[Old St. Peter's Basilica|St. Peter's Basilica]], and the Palatine palace.<ref name=ambrosini/> Between the 11th and the 13th centuries, a large part of these archives disappeared. \n\nWhen the Popes moved to [[Avignon Papacy|Avignon]], the process of transporting their archives took twenty years, all told. The various places where the archives were kept along the way were sacked by the [[Guelphs and Ghibellines|Ghibellines]] three separate times, in 1314, 1319, and 1320.<ref name=ambrosini>{{Cite book|title=The Secret Archives of the Vatican|last=Ambrosini|first=Maria Luisa|date=1969|publisher=Little, Brown, & Co.|isbn=0760701253|location=Boston|pages=16, 27, 134 | oclc=35364715|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=0Cc9A9_DIQ4C&pg=PA16& |access-date = 7 November 2019}}</ref>\n\n[[Antipope]]s also had their own archives.

His successor, [[Pope Gregory XII]], supposedly sold off a large number of archival materials in 1406, including some of the papal registers.<ref name=ambrosini />\n\n=== Founding the archive ===\nIn 1612, [[Pope Paul V]] ordered all Church records assembled in one place.<ref name=ambrosini/>\n\n== French seizure and restoration ==\n\nAs [[Napoleon]] conquered the states on the Italian peninsula in the 1790s, he demanded works of art and manuscripts as tribute. His armistice with Holy See on 23 June 1796 stipulated that \"the Pope shall deliver to the French Republic one hundred pictures, busts, vases or statues ... and five hundred manuscripts\" all chosen by French agents. The 1798 [[Treaty of Tolentino]] made even greater demands and the works sent to Paris included the [[Codex Vaticanus]], the oldest extant manuscript of the Bible in Greek. By the time Napoleon became emperor in 1804, he envisaged a central archive in Paris of the records and treasures of Europe. In 1809 he ordered the entire Vatican Archive transferred to Paris and by 1813 more than 3,000 crates had been shipped with only modest losses.<ref name=cuccia>{{cite journal|url = https://www.cairn.info/revue-napoleonica-la-revue-2013-2-page-66.htm | title = Controlling the Archives: The Requisition, Removal, and Return of the Vatican Archives during the Age of Napoleon | journal = Napoleonica.

In August 1883 he wrote to the three cardinals who shared responsibility for the archives and praised the potential of historical research to clarify the role of the papacy in European culture and Italian politics. He announced that the archives would be open to research that was impartial and critical. In an address to the [[G\u00f6rres Society]] in February 1884, Pope Leo said: \"Go to the sources.

is a [[home video game console]] developed by [[Microsoft]]. As the successor to the [[Xbox (console)|original Xbox]], it is the second console in the [[Xbox]] series. It competed with [[Sony]]'s [[PlayStation 3]] and [[Nintendo]]'s [[Wii]] as part of the [[seventh generation of video game consoles]]. It was officially unveiled on [[MTV]] on May 12, 2005, with detailed launch and game information announced later that month at the 2005 [[Electronic Entertainment Expo]].\n\nThe Xbox 360 features an online service, [[Xbox Live]], which was expanded from its previous iteration on the original Xbox and received regular updates during the console's lifetime. Available in free and subscription-based varieties, Xbox Live allows users to: [[Online game|play games online]]; download games (through [[Xbox Live Arcade]]) and game demos; purchase and [[Streaming media|stream]] music, television programs, and films through the [[Xbox Music]] and [[Xbox Video]] portals; and access third-party content services through media streaming applications. In addition to online multimedia features, it allows users to stream media from local PCs. Several peripherals have been released, including wireless [[Xbox 360 controller|controllers]], expanded [[hard disk drive|hard drive]] storage, and the [[Kinect]] [[motion sensing]] camera. The release of these additional services and peripherals helped the Xbox brand grow from gaming-only to encompassing all multimedia, turning it into a hub for living-room computing entertainment.<ref name=\"pcmag.com\">{{cite news | url=https://www.pcmag.com/slideshow_viewer/0,3253,l=251237&a=251237&po=8,00.asp | work=PC Magazine | title=The 10 Greatest Video Game Consoles of All Time | access-date=May 14, 2019 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160503081048/http://www.pcmag.com/slideshow_viewer/0%2C3253%2Cl%3D251237%26a%3D251237%26po%3D8%2C00.asp | archive-date=May 3, 2016 | url-status=live | df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref name=\"businessweek.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/steve-ballmer-reboots-01122012.html|title=Steve Ballmer Reboots|author=Ashlee Vance|date=January 13, 2012|work=Bloomberg.com|access-date=November 21, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131128044033/http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/steve-ballmer-reboots-01122012.html|archive-date=November 28, 2013|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref name=\"theverge.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2012/11/13/3633038/microsoft-xbox-360-trojan-horse-living-room|title=Living with the Xbox 360: how Microsoft's trojan horse took over your living room|author=Ross Miller|date=November 13, 2012|publisher=Vox Media|work=The Verge|access-date=September 18, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170826152918/https://www.theverge.com/2012/11/13/3633038/microsoft-xbox-360-trojan-horse-living-room|archive-date=August 26, 2017|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite news | url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2397387,00.asp | work=PC Magazine | title=Is the Xbox 360 the Elusive Living Room PC? | accessdate=January 22, 2017 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170826120455/https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2397387,00.asp | archive-date=August 26, 2017 | url-status=live | df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref name=\"trlegacy\">{{cite web|url=http://www.techradar.com/news/gaming/consoles/how-the-xbox-360-won-the-console-war-1196990|title=How the Xbox 360 won the console war|author=Jon Hicks|work=TechRadar|accessdate=January 22, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161210163547/http://www.techradar.com/news/gaming/consoles/how-the-xbox-360-won-the-console-war-1196990|archive-date=December 10, 2016|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n[[Xbox 360 launch|Launched]] worldwide across 2005\u20132006, the Xbox 360 was initially in short supply in many regions, including North America and Europe.

is a [[home video game console]] developed by [[Microsoft]]. As the successor to the [[Xbox (console)|original Xbox]], it is the second console in the [[Xbox]] series. It competed with [[Sony]]'s [[PlayStation 3]] and [[Nintendo]]'s [[Wii]] as part of the [[seventh generation of video game consoles]]. It was officially unveiled on [[MTV]] on May 12, 2005, with detailed launch and game information announced later that month at the 2005 [[Electronic Entertainment Expo]].\n\nThe Xbox 360 features an online service, [[Xbox Live]], which was expanded from its previous iteration on the original Xbox and received regular updates during the console's lifetime. Available in free and subscription-based varieties, Xbox Live allows users to: [[Online game|play games online]]; download games (through [[Xbox Live Arcade]]) and game demos; purchase and [[Streaming media|stream]] music, television programs, and films through the [[Xbox Music]] and [[Xbox Video]] portals; and access third-party content services through media streaming applications. In addition to online multimedia features, it allows users to stream media from local PCs. Several peripherals have been released, including wireless [[Xbox 360 controller|controllers]], expanded [[hard disk drive|hard drive]] storage, and the [[Kinect]] [[motion sensing]] camera. The release of these additional services and peripherals helped the Xbox brand grow from gaming-only to encompassing all multimedia, turning it into a hub for living-room computing entertainment.<ref name=\"pcmag.com\">{{cite news | url=https://www.pcmag.com/slideshow_viewer/0,3253,l=251237&a=251237&po=8,00.asp | work=PC Magazine | title=The 10 Greatest Video Game Consoles of All Time | access-date=May 14, 2019 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160503081048/http://www.pcmag.com/slideshow_viewer/0%2C3253%2Cl%3D251237%26a%3D251237%26po%3D8%2C00.asp | archive-date=May 3, 2016 | url-status=live | df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref name=\"businessweek.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/steve-ballmer-reboots-01122012.html|title=Steve Ballmer Reboots|author=Ashlee Vance|date=January 13, 2012|work=Bloomberg.com|access-date=November 21, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131128044033/http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/steve-ballmer-reboots-01122012.html|archive-date=November 28, 2013|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref name=\"theverge.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2012/11/13/3633038/microsoft-xbox-360-trojan-horse-living-room|title=Living with the Xbox 360: how Microsoft's trojan horse took over your living room|author=Ross Miller|date=November 13, 2012|publisher=Vox Media|work=The Verge|access-date=September 18, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170826152918/https://www.theverge.com/2012/11/13/3633038/microsoft-xbox-360-trojan-horse-living-room|archive-date=August 26, 2017|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite news | url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2397387,00.asp | work=PC Magazine | title=Is the Xbox 360 the Elusive Living Room PC? | accessdate=January 22, 2017 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170826120455/https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2397387,00.asp | archive-date=August 26, 2017 | url-status=live | df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref name=\"trlegacy\">{{cite web|url=http://www.techradar.com/news/gaming/consoles/how-the-xbox-360-won-the-console-war-1196990|title=How the Xbox 360 won the console war|author=Jon Hicks|work=TechRadar|accessdate=January 22, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161210163547/http://www.techradar.com/news/gaming/consoles/how-the-xbox-360-won-the-console-war-1196990|archive-date=December 10, 2016|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n[[Xbox 360 launch|Launched]] worldwide across 2005\u20132006, the Xbox 360 was initially in short supply in many regions, including North America and Europe.
