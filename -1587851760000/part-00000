They played at the 2nd level of Soviet football between 1959 and 1968. The results varied between seasons, as the team managed to finish 1st in their zone in 1962 as well as last in 1959 and 1963. However, because Soviet league system structure was changing almost every season in the 1950s and 1960s, Lokomotiv wasn't promoted or relegated until another league reorganisation in 1969.\n\n''Gomselmash'' played at the 3rd level of Soviet football between 1969 and 1989, until further league reorganisation in 1990, after which the team was relegated to the 4th level.\n\nIn 1992, Gomselmash joined the newly formed [[Belarusian Premier League]]. The first years were unsuccessful and the team relegated in 1995. They changed name to the current one, FC Gomel, the same year. In 1998, Gomel returned to Premier League and achieved much better results than before (champions title in 2003, 2nd place in 2007 and 3rd in 1999). The team also won the [[Belarusian Cup]] in 2002 and made it to the final in 2004.\n\nIn 2012, they played English club [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] in the [[UEFA Europa League]] qualifying rounds. In the first leg they lost 0\u20131 and lost again away at [[Anfield]] in the second leg 3\u20130.\n\n=== Name changes ===\n*1959: Lokomotiv Gomel\n*1965: Spartak Gomel\n*1969: Gomselmash

However, because Soviet league system structure was changing almost every season in the 1950s and 60s, Lokomotiv wasn't promoted or relegated until another league reorganisation in 1969.\n\n''Gomselmash'' played at the 3rd level of Soviet football between 1969 and 1989, until further league reorganisation in 1990, after which the team was relegated to the 4th level.\n\nIn 1992 Gomselmash joined the newly formed [[Belarusian Premier League]]. The first years were unsuccessful and the team relegated in 1995. They changed name to the current one, FC Gomel, the same year. In 1998 Gomel returned to Premier League and achieved much better results than before (champions title in 2003, 2nd place in 2007 and 3rd in 1999). The team also won [[Belarusian Cup]] in 2002 and made it to the final in 2004.\n\nIn 2012, they played English club [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] in the [[UEFA Europa League]] qualifying rounds. In the first leg they lost 0\u20131 and lost again away at [[Anfield]] in the second leg 3\u20130.\n\n=== Name changes ===\n*1959: Lokomotiv Gomel\n*1965: Spartak Gomel\n*1969: Gomselmash

Construction of the locomotive was completed on March 26th, 1891, and it was given Rogers construction number 4493.

Kelly'' after the company's treasurer. [[File:Prescott and Arizona Central 3.jpg|thumb|left|Sierra Railway #3 on the P&AC.]] The P&AC went bankrupt in 1893 and its owner, Thomas S. Bullock, relocated to California bringing much of his railroad equipment, including the No. 3.  He then entered into a partnership with Prince Andr\u00e9 Poniatowski and [[William H. Crocker]], and together in 1897 they incorporated the [[Sierra Railway Company of California]] to connect [[Oakdale, California]] with the timber producing regions of [[Tuolumne County]] and [[Calaveras County]].<ref name=KW>{{cite web\n  | last = Wyatt\n  | first = Kyle\n  | authorlink = \n  | coauthors = \n  | title = A History of Sierra Railway 4-6-0 No. 3 \n  | work = \n  | publisher = [[Railtown 1897 State Historic Park]]\n  | date = February 27, 1991\n  | url = http://railtown.team.parks.ca.gov/.../1/SRy%20Loco%203%20Article.doc\n  | format = Microsoft Word document\n  | doi = \n  | accessdate = June 8, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe locomotive was then rechristened Sierra No. 3, and played a key role of the construction of the railroad to [[Jamestown, California]] in 1897, [[Sonora, California]] in 1899 and [[Tuolumne, California]] in 1900.  It was the primary locomotive pulling freight trains on the railroad until 1906, when the Sierra Railway purchased a new [[Baldwin Locomotive Works]] [[2-8-0]] locomotive.  It played a significant role in logging, mining and dam building operations in the Sierra foothills.\n\nOriginally built to burn coal, the locomotive was converted to burn oil sometime between 1900 and 1902.<ref name=Wyatt/>\n\nSierra No. 3 was involved in several wrecks.  In February 1898, a [[Railroad switch|switch]] mishap killed conductor William G. Bailey.<ref name=KW/> In September 1899, its tender derailed while backing up on a [[trestle]], causing it to collapse. [[File:Sierra Railway 3 1918 Derailment.jpg|thumb|left|No. 3's 1918 derailment that destroyed the original wooden cab.]] The locomotive turned on its side in 1918 just above Sonora, destroying its original wooden cab, which was replaced with a second-hand steel Southern Pacific Railroad cab in February 1919.<ref name=KW/>  Two years later, Sierra No. 3 made her first known Hollywood film appearance, in a silent film ''[[The Terror (1920 film)|The Terror]]'' starring [[Tom Mix]].\n\nDuring the [[Great Depression]], the Sierra Railway went into bankruptcy, and was reorganized as the [[Sierra Railroad Company]] in 1937.<ref name=Wyatt/>  Sierra No. 3 was taken out of service in 1932, and sat on a siding in the Jamestown yard for 15 years.<ref name=Railtown1/>  It managed to avoid being scrapped during World War II, and again received attention from Hollywood in 1946, when [[David O. Selznick]], the producer of ''[[Duel in the Sun (film)|Duel in the Sun]]'' being filmed on the Sierra Railroad, proposed to destroy her in a train wreck scene for the movie. The Sierra Railroad's Master Mechanic Bill Tremewan persuaded the railroad ownership not to consider a notion so \"ridiculous\", and instead shop crews restored the locomotive to operation for potential charter and movie service.<ref name=Wyatt/>  Inspection of the boiler proved it was in serviceable condition, however the resulting work required a reduction of the Maximum Allowable Working Pressure from {{convert|160|to|150|psi|MPa|2|abbr=on}}.  The rebuild was completed in 1948, and the locomotive officially returned to service heading a Railway and Locomotive Historical Society sponsored excursion train on May 30.  Over the next half-century, Sierra No. 3 pulled tourist excursion trains and appeared in dozens of films, TV shows, and commercials.  Among them were ''[[High Noon]]'' in 1952, for which [[Gary Cooper]] won the [[Academy Award for Best Actor]], and ''[[Unforgiven]]'', starring and directed by [[Clint Eastwood]], which won the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]] for 1992.\n[[File:Back to the Future III smokestack.jpg|thumb|Damaged smokestack used in the locomotive explosion scene in ''[[Back to the Future Part III]]''.]]\n\nThe locomotive was often redecorated for various movie and television appearances, one of its most famous roles being the ''[[Hooterville Cannonball]]'' from the mid-sixties series ''[[Petticoat Junction]]''. False [[Chimney (locomotive)|smokestacks]] were also often installed to alter the appearance of the locomotive.\n\nIn 1979, Crocker and Associates announced their intention to sell their interest in the railroad to Silverfoot, Inc. based in Chicago, but the deal did not include the locomotive facilities in Jamestown.<ref name=KW/>  The complex, including Sierra No. 3, was acquired by the State of California as a result of legislation passed in April 1981, and signed by Governor [[Jerry Brown]].  The acquisition was completed on September 15, 1982, and since then, the locomotive has been the property of the State of California.<ref name=Wyatt/>\n\nIn 1995, the [[Federal Railroad Administration]] issued new safety standards for steam locomotive boilers. In order to comply with these revised regulations, Sierra No. 3 was removed from service until a complete evaluation of the locomotive's condition could be made.\n\n==21st-century renovation==\n[[File:Old Sierra No. 3 - DH.jpg|thumb|Sierra No. 3 in the [[Railway roundhouse|roundhouse]] at [[Railtown 1897 State Historic Park]] in 2011]]\n[[File:Sierra No. 3 in roundhouse.jpg|thumb|Sierra No. 3 next to locomotives #28 & #34 in the [[Railway roundhouse|roundhouse]] at [[Railtown 1897 State Historic Park]]]]\n[[File:Sierra No 3 old boiler.jpg|thumb|left|Sierra Railway No. 3's original boiler that was replaced during a rebuild, photo taken 2011]]\n[[File:Movie Star Sierra 3.jpg|thumb|Renovated movie star Sierra No. 3. taken on [[Labor Day]] 2011]]\n\nPreliminary repairs were completed in 2000\u20132001 with deferred maintenance funding from the State of California.

Bullock, relocated to California bringing much of his railroad equipment, including the No. 3.  He then entered into a partnership with Prince Andr\u00e9 Poniatowski and [[William H.

It was the primary locomotive pulling freight trains on the railroad until 1906, when the Sierra Railway purchased a new [[Baldwin Locomotive Works]] [[2-8-0]] locomotive.  It played a significant role in logging, mining and dam building operations in the Sierra foothills.\n\nOriginally built to burn coal, the locomotive was converted to burn oil sometime between 1900 and 1902.<ref name=Wyatt/>\n\nSierra No. 3 was involved in several wrecks.  In February 1898, a [[Railroad switch|switch]] mishap killed conductor William G. Bailey.<ref name=KW/> In September 1899, its tender derailed while backing up on a [[trestle]], causing it to collapse. [[File:Sierra Railway 3 1918 Derailment.jpg|thumb|left|No. 3's 1918 derailment that destroyed the original wooden cab.]] The locomotive turned on its side in 1918 just above Sonora, destroying its original wooden cab, which was replaced with a second-hand steel Southern Pacific Railroad cab in February 1919.<ref name=KW/>  Two years later, Sierra No. 3 made her first known Hollywood film appearance, in a silent film ''[[The Terror (1920 film)|The Terror]]'' starring [[Tom Mix]].\n\nDuring the [[Great Depression]], the Sierra Railway went into bankruptcy, and was reorganized as the [[Sierra Railroad Company]] in 1937.<ref name=Wyatt/>  Sierra No. 3 was taken out of service in 1932, and sat on a siding in the Jamestown yard for 15 years.<ref name=Railtown1/>  It managed to avoid being scrapped during World War II, and again received attention from Hollywood in 1946, when [[David O. Selznick]], the producer of ''[[Duel in the Sun (film)|Duel in the Sun]]'' being filmed on the Sierra Railroad, proposed to destroy her in a train wreck scene for the movie. The Sierra Railroad's Master Mechanic Bill Tremewan persuaded the railroad ownership not to consider a notion so \"ridiculous\", and instead shop crews restored the locomotive to operation for potential charter and movie service.<ref name=Wyatt/>  Inspection of the boiler proved it was in serviceable condition, however the resulting work required a reduction of the Maximum Allowable Working Pressure from {{convert|160|to|150|psi|MPa|2|abbr=on}}.  The rebuild was completed in 1948, and the locomotive officially returned to service heading a Railway and Locomotive Historical Society sponsored excursion train on May 30.  Over the next half-century, Sierra No. 3 pulled tourist excursion trains and appeared in dozens of films, TV shows, and commercials.  Among them were ''[[High Noon]]'' in 1952, for which [[Gary Cooper]] won the [[Academy Award for Best Actor]], and ''[[Unforgiven]]'', starring and directed by [[Clint Eastwood]], which won the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]] for 1992.\n[[File:Back to the Future III smokestack.jpg|thumb|Damaged smokestack used in the locomotive explosion scene in ''[[Back to the Future Part III]]''.]]\n\nThe locomotive was often redecorated for various movie and television appearances, one of its most famous roles being the ''[[Hooterville Cannonball]]'' from the mid-sixties series ''[[Petticoat Junction]]''. False [[Chimney (locomotive)|smokestacks]] were also often installed to alter the appearance of the locomotive.\n\nIn 1979, Crocker and Associates announced their intention to sell their interest in the railroad to Silverfoot, Inc. based in Chicago, but the deal did not include the locomotive facilities in Jamestown.<ref name=KW/>  The complex, including Sierra No. 3, was acquired by the State of California as a result of legislation passed in April 1981, and signed by Governor [[Jerry Brown]].  The acquisition was completed on September 15, 1982, and since then, the locomotive has been the property of the State of California.<ref name=Wyatt/>\n\nIn 1995, the [[Federal Railroad Administration]] issued new safety standards for steam locomotive boilers. In order to comply with these revised regulations, Sierra No. 3 was removed from service until a complete evaluation of the locomotive's condition could be made.\n\n==21st-century renovation==\n[[File:Old Sierra No. 3 - DH.jpg|thumb|Sierra No. 3 in the [[Railway roundhouse|roundhouse]] at [[Railtown 1897 State Historic Park]] in 2011]]\n[[File:Sierra No. 3 in roundhouse.jpg|thumb|Sierra No. 3 next to locomotives #28 & #34 in the [[Railway roundhouse|roundhouse]] at [[Railtown 1897 State Historic Park]]]]\n[[File:Sierra No 3 old boiler.jpg|thumb|left|Sierra Railway No. 3's original boiler that was replaced during a rebuild, photo taken 2011]]\n[[File:Movie Star Sierra 3.jpg|thumb|Renovated movie star Sierra No. 3. taken on [[Labor Day]] 2011]]\n\nPreliminary repairs were completed in 2000\u20132001 with deferred maintenance funding from the State of California.

Lewis''' (December 7, 1942 \u2013 January 19, 1993), was an [[United States|American]] businessman. He was one of the richest [[African-American]] men in the 1980s, and the first [[African American]] to build a billion-dollar company, TLC Beatrice International Holdings Inc.<ref>https://www.theroot.com/billion-dollar-legacy-reginald-f-lewis-incredible-li-1823041385</ref>\n\nIn 1993, ''[[Forbes]]'' listed Lewis among the 400 richest Americans, with a [[net worth]] estimated at $400 million.<ref>https://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/article/A-Black-Man-s-Journey-to-the-Forbes-400-List-3045896.php</ref><ref>https://articles.latimes.com/1993-01-20/business/fi-1542_1_leveraged-buyout</ref>\n\n==Career==\n{{unreferenced|date=April 2018|section}}\nRecruited to top New York law firm [[Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP]] immediately after law school, Lewis left to start his own firm two years later. After 15 years as a corporate lawyer with his own practice, he moved to the other side of the table by creating TLC Group L.P., a [[private equity ]] firm, in 1983.\n\nHis first major deal was the purchase of the McCall Pattern Company, a home sewing pattern business, for $22.5 million. Lewis had learned from a [[Fortune (magazine)|''Fortune'' magazine]] article that the [[JBS USA#Esmark|Esmark]] holding company, which had recently purchased [[Norton Simon]], planned to divest from the [[McCall Corporation|McCall]] Pattern Company, a maker of home sewing patterns founded in 1870. With fewer and fewer people sewing at home, McCall was seemingly on the decline\u2014though it had posted profits of $6 million in 1983 on sales of $51.9 million. At the time, McCall was number two in its industry, holding 29.7 percent of the market, compared to industry leader [[Simplicity Pattern]]s with 39.4 percent.\n\nHe managed to negotiate the price down, then raised $1 million himself from family and friends and borrowed the rest from institutional investors and investment banking firm [[First Boston]] Corp.\n\nWithin a year, he turned the company around by freeing up capital tied in fixed assets such as building and machinery, and finding a new use for machinery during downtime by manufacturing greeting cards. He then started to recruit managers from rival companies. He further strengthened McCall by containing costs, improving quality, beginning to export to China, and emphasizing new product introductions. This new combination led to the company's most profitable year in its history. With the addition of McCall real estate worth an estimated $6 million that the company retained ownership of, he later sold McCall at a 90-1 return, resulting in a tremendous profit for investors. Lewis's share was 81.7 percent of the $90 million.\n\nIn 1987, Lewis bought [[Beatrice Foods|Beatrice International Foods]] from Beatrice Companies for $985 million, renaming it TLC Beatrice International Holdings Inc.<ref>https://www.nytimes.com/1987/08/10/business/beatrice-unit-brings-985-million.html</ref>, a snack food, beverage, and grocery store conglomerate that was the largest African-American owned and managed business in the U.S. The deal was partly financed through Michael Milken of the maverick investment bank [[Drexel Burnham Lambert]]. In order to reduce the amount needed to finance the [[leveraged buyout]], Lewis came up with a plan to sell off some of the division's assets simultaneous with the takeover.\n\nWhen TLC Beatrice reported revenue of $1.8 billion in 1987, it became the first black-owned company to have more than $1 billion in annual sales. At its peak in 1996, TLC Beatrice International Holdings Inc. had sales of $2.2 billion and was number 512 on ''Fortune'' magazine's list of 1,000 largest companies.\n\n==Philanthropy==\n{{Advert|date=March 2019}}\nIn 1987 Lewis established the Reginald F. Lewis Foundation, which funded grants of approximately $10 million to various non-profit programs and organizations while he was alive. His first major grant was an unsolicited $1 million to [[Howard University]] in 1988; the federal government matched the grant, making the gift $2 million, which was used to fund an endowment for scholarships, fellowships, and faculty sabbaticals.<ref>[http://www.reginaldflewis.com/beachglamour/legacy.html \"Reginald F. Lewis as Philanthropist\"]</ref>\n\nIn 1992, Lewis donated $3 million to [[Harvard Law School]], the largest grant at the time in the school's history.<ref>[http://www.law.harvard.edu/academics/fellowships/the-reginald-f.-lewis-fellowships-for-law-teaching.html \"The Reginald F.

Lewis International Law Center, the first major facility at Harvard named in honor of an African-American.<ref>[http://www.law.harvard.edu/about/administration/facilities/buildings/lewis.html \"Building Overview: Lewis International Law Center\"]</ref>\n\nWhile alive, Lewis made known his desire to support a museum of African American culture. In 2005, the [[Reginald F. Lewis Museum of Maryland African American History & Culture]] opened in [[Baltimore]] with the support of a $5 million grant from his foundation.<ref>[http://www.reginaldflewis.com/biography-4.php \"Reginald F.

The museum is also a [[Smithsonian Affiliations|Smithsonian affiliate]].\n\n==Personal life==\nBorn in [[Baltimore, Maryland]], Lewis grew up in a middle-class neighborhood. He won a football scholarship to [[Virginia State University|Virginia State University (VSU)]] and joined the Alpha Phi Chapter of [[Kappa Alpha Psi]] while an undergraduate student.<ref name=\"reginaldflewis\">http://reginaldflewis.com/reginaldflewis.com/legacy-scholarship-fund.html</ref> After graduating from VSU with a degree in political science in 1965, he immediately attended [[Harvard Law School]] and completed his [[Juris Doctorate]] degree in 1968.<ref name=\"reginaldflewis\"/>\n\nHe was married to [[Loida Nicolas-Lewis]].

Lewis''' (December 7, 1942 \u2013 January 19, 1993), was an [[United States|American]] businessman. He was one of the richest [[African-American]] men in the 1980s, and the first [[African American]] to build a billion-dollar company, TLC Beatrice International Holdings Inc.<ref>https://www.theroot.com/billion-dollar-legacy-reginald-f-lewis-incredible-li-1823041385</ref>\n\nIn 1993, ''[[Forbes]]'' listed Lewis among the 400 richest Americans, with a [[net worth]] estimated at $400 million.<ref>https://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/article/A-Black-Man-s-Journey-to-the-Forbes-400-List-3045896.php</ref><ref>https://articles.latimes.com/1993-01-20/business/fi-1542_1_leveraged-buyout</ref>\n\n==Career==\n{{unreferenced|date=April 2018|section}}\nRecruited to top New York law firm [[Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP]] immediately after law school, Lewis left to start his own firm two years later. After 15 years as a corporate lawyer with his own practice, he moved to the other side of the table by creating TLC Group L.P., a [[private equity ]] firm, in 1983.\n\nHis first major deal was the purchase of the McCall Pattern Company, a home sewing pattern business, for $22.5 million. Lewis had learned from a [[Fortune (magazine)|''Fortune'' magazine]] article that the [[JBS USA#Esmark|Esmark]] holding company, which had recently purchased [[Norton Simon]], planned to divest from the [[McCall Corporation|McCall]] Pattern Company, a maker of home sewing patterns founded in 1870. With fewer and fewer people sewing at home, McCall was seemingly on the decline\u2014though it had posted profits of $6 million in 1983 on sales of $51.9 million. At the time, McCall was number two in its industry, holding 29.7 percent of the market, compared to industry leader [[Simplicity Pattern]]s with 39.4 percent.\n\nHe managed to negotiate the price down, then raised $1 million himself from family and friends and borrowed the rest from institutional investors and investment banking firm [[First Boston]] Corp.\n\nWithin a year, he turned the company around by freeing up capital tied in fixed assets such as building and machinery, and finding a new use for machinery during downtime by manufacturing greeting cards. He then started to recruit managers from rival companies. He further strengthened McCall by containing costs, improving quality, beginning to export to China, and emphasizing new product introductions. This new combination led to the company's most profitable year in its history. With the addition of McCall real estate worth an estimated $6 million that the company retained ownership of, he later sold McCall at a 90-1 return, resulting in a tremendous profit for investors. Lewis's share was 81.7 percent of the $90 million.\n\nIn 1987, Lewis bought [[Beatrice Foods|Beatrice International Foods]] from Beatrice Companies for $985 million, renaming it TLC Beatrice International Holdings Inc.<ref>https://www.nytimes.com/1987/08/10/business/beatrice-unit-brings-985-million.html</ref>, a snack food, beverage, and grocery store conglomerate that was the largest African-American owned and managed business in the U.S. The deal was partly financed through Mike Milken of the maverick investment bank [[Drexel Burnham Lambert]]. In order to reduce the amount needed to finance the [[leveraged buyout]], Lewis came up with a plan to sell off some of the division's assets simultaneous with the takeover.\n\nWhen TLC Beatrice reported revenue of $1.8 billion in 1987, it became the first black-owned company to have more than $1 billion in annual sales. At its peak in 1996, TLC Beatrice International Holdings Inc. had sales of $2.2 billion and was number 512 on ''Fortune'' magazine's list of 1,000 largest companies.\n\n==Philanthropy==\n{{Advert|date=March 2019}}\nIn 1987 Lewis established the Reginald F. Lewis Foundation, which funded grants of approximately $10 million to various non-profit programs and organizations while he was alive. His first major grant was an unsolicited $1 million to [[Howard University]] in 1988; the federal government matched the grant, making the gift $2 million, which was used to fund an endowment for scholarships, fellowships, and faculty sabbaticals.<ref>[http://www.reginaldflewis.com/beachglamour/legacy.html \"Reginald F. Lewis as Philanthropist\"]</ref>\n\nIn 1992, Lewis donated $3 million to [[Harvard Law School]], the largest grant at the time in the school's history.<ref>[http://www.law.harvard.edu/academics/fellowships/the-reginald-f.-lewis-fellowships-for-law-teaching.html \"The Reginald F.

Lewis International Law Center, the first major facility at Harvard named in honor of an African-American.<ref>[http://www.law.harvard.edu/about/administration/facilities/buildings/lewis.html \"Building Overview: Lewis International Law Center\"]</ref>\n\nWhile alive, Lewis made known his desire to support a museum of African American culture. In 2005, the [[Reginald F. Lewis Museum of Maryland African American History & Culture]] opened in [[Baltimore]] with the support of a $5 million grant from his foundation.<ref>[http://www.reginaldflewis.com/biography-4.php \"Reginald F.

The museum is also a [[Smithsonian Affiliations|Smithsonian affiliate]].\n\n==Personal life==\nBorn in [[Baltimore, Maryland]], Lewis grew up in a middle-class neighborhood. He won a football scholarship to [[Virginia State University|Virginia State University (VSU)]] and joined the Alpha Phi Chapter of [[Kappa Alpha Psi]] while an undergraduate student.<ref name=\"reginaldflewis\">http://reginaldflewis.com/reginaldflewis.com/legacy-scholarship-fund.html</ref> After graduating from VSU with a degree in political science in 1965, he immediately attended [[Harvard Law School]] and completed his [[Juris Doctorate]] degree in 1968.<ref name=\"reginaldflewis\"/>\n\nHe was married to [[Loida Nicolas-Lewis]]. They had two daughters, Leslie and Christina.<ref>http://www.baltimoresun.com/entertainment/arts/bs-ae-lewis-memoir-20120210-story.html</ref>\n\nLewis died at age 50, from [[brain cancer]].
