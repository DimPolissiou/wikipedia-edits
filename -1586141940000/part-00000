Throughout the first half of the 1980s, the band also enjoyed a number of smaller chart successes in multiple markets.\n\n==History==\n===Beginnings (1978\u20131982)===\nFormed in [[Leighton Buzzard]], [[Bedfordshire]] in 1978, the band were originally known as '''Art Nouveau''', a four-piece [[avant-garde]] group, with [[Nick Beggs]] on bass guitar, [[Steve Askew]] on lead guitar, Stuart Croxford Neale on keyboards, and [[Jez Strode|Jeremy \"Jez\" Strode]] on drums. Art Nouveau released a track called \"The Fear Machine\", which sold a few hundred copies and enjoyed airtime on [[John Peel|John Peel's]] show. In spite of the song's success, the band failed to secure a record deal during this period.\n\nIn 1981, Art Noveau advertised for a new lead singer. They ultimately auditioned and choose [[Limahl|Christopher Hamill]], who then went under the stage name Limahl (an [[anagram]] of his surname). The group renamed themselves '''Kajagoogoo''', a name coined [[Phonetics|phonetically]] from ''ga ga goo goo'', the first sounds that many infants make.<ref name=\"kajagoogoo1\">{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.kajagoogoo.com/ |title=Kajagoogoo.com |publisher=Kajagoogoo.com |date= |accessdate=14 December 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Success and decline (1982\u20131985)===\nThe band signed with [[EMI Records]] in July 1982 after Limahl had met keyboardist [[Nick Rhodes]] of the group [[Duran Duran]] while working as a waiter at London's Embassy Club.<ref>The Very Best of Kajagoogoo \u2013 liner notes (Chris White, 1996, EMI Gold \u2013 Cat no.724385295621)</ref> Rhodes proceeded to co-produce the band's first single, \"[[Too Shy]]\" with Duran Duran's EMI producer [[Colin Thurston]]. The single was released on 10 January 1983 and topped the [[UK Singles Chart]]<ref name=\"British Hit Singles & Albums\"/>, having done so before any of Duran Duran's singles (as Rhodes himself has lightheartedly noted).\n\nFollow-up singles \"Ooh to Be Aah\" and \"Hang on Now\" also both reached the [[UK Top 40|UK Top 20]], and the group's debut album ''[[White Feathers]]'' reached No. 5 in the [[UK Albums Chart]].<ref name=\"British Hit Singles & Albums\"/> After being the support act for the [[Birmingham]] band [[Fashion (band)|Fashion]] in late 1982, Kajagoogoo embarked on their own headlining ''White Feathers'' tour in Spring 1983. Their performance on 31 May at the [[Hammersmith Odeon|London Hammersmith Odeon]] was filmed and released on home video.\n\nAs success came, tensions began to rise in the band. These tensions culminated in Limahl being fired by the other band members in mid-1983 and Nick Beggs then taking over as lead singer. In response to his ousting, Limahl accused the others of being envious of him and said \"I've been betrayed!\" and \"I was sacked for making them a success.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ukfestivalguides.com/artist/limahl |title=Limahl \u2013 Latest festivals, news, tickets and more |publisher=Ukfestivalguides.com |date=19 December 1958 |accessdate=14 December 2012}}</ref> The other band members countered Limahl's assertions, insisting that he had become egomaniacal and increasingly difficult to work with. Soon after the departure, Beggs commented, \"It was a business decision and not one we took lightly. He wanted the band to go in a different direction to the rest of us. Eventually, we realised we were on a different planet to Limahl.\"<ref name=\"Smash Hits\">{{cite magazine |last1= Steels|first1= Deborah|last2= |first2= |title= The Fruit Case (Kajagoogoo interview))|magazine= Smash Hits|volume= 5|issue= 19|pages=41\u201342|publisher= EMAP Metro|date=15 September 1983}}</ref> Beggs also stated that the band harboured no ill-will towards Limahl, and blamed the press for sensationalising the matter. Guitarist Steve Askew commented \"At first ... we did everything possible to make Limahl feel like part of the furniture but, you know, his lifestyle is so different from ours. We're very normal people whereas Limahl likes the bright lights.\"<ref name=\"Smash Hits\"/>\n\nThe first single by the new four-piece lineup, \"[[Big Apple (song)|Big Apple]]\", was released in September 1983 and reached the UK Top Ten. Their next single, \"The Lion's Mouth\", was released in February 1984 and made the UK Top 30,<ref name=\"British Hit Singles & Albums\"/>. After this, public interest in the group waned, and their next single \"[[Turn Your Back on Me (song)|Turn Your Back On Me]]\" failed to make the Top 40. The subsequent new album, ''[[Islands (Kajagoogoo album)|Islands]]'', was also a commercial disappointment, peaking at No. 35 in the UK.<ref name=\"British Hit Singles & Albums\"/>\n\nIn the US, the band first adopted the '''Kaja''' moniker at this time, and a different edition of the ''Islands'' album was released there as ''[[Islands (Kajagoogoo album)|Extra Play]]'', peaking at No. 185 on the Billboard charts. However, the single \"Turn Your Back on Me\" did well on the US Dance Charts, peaking at No. 2 for two weeks.<ref>{{cite book |title= Hot Dance/Disco: 1974\u20132003|last=Whitburn |first=Joel |authorlink=Joel Whitburn |year=2004 |publisher=Record Research |page=141}}</ref> Meanwhile, Limahl went on to equally brief success as a solo artist and Strode left the band.\n\nIn an attempt to regain credibility and lose their light-hearted, [[Bubblegum pop|bubblegum]] image, the remaining three members relaunched as '''Kaja''' in the UK in 1985. Following the name change, the band released the single \"Shouldn't Do That\" (UK No.&nbsp;63) in August 1985.<ref name=\"British Hit Singles & Albums\"/> The song was featured on their third album, ''[[Crazy People's Right to Speak]]''. After this proved unsuccessful, the group disbanded in December 1985.<ref>\"Kaja Go-Go\", ''[[Sounds (magazine)|Sounds]]'', 14 December 1985, p. 4</ref>\n\n===Reunions (2003\u20132011)===\nThe original five-piece line-up of the band briefly joined forces again on [[VH1]]'s ''[[Bands Reunited]]'' in 2003.\n\nFollowing the much publicised VH1 reunion, the original group received many offers and incentives to continue to play together,<ref name=\"kajagoogoo1\"/> but disagreements continued between the band members and the reunion was short-lived, as Limahl and Strode both departed the band again shortly thereafter, ultimately leading them to dissolve the following year. The group felt that the VH1 feature was unfairly edited to portray simplified reasons as to why Limahl was fired and Strode had left the band in the 1980s.<ref name=\"kajagoogoo1\"/>\n\nIn 2007, Nick Beggs, Steve Askew, and Stuart Neale decided to continue as Kajagoogoo, releasing the single \"Rocket Boy\" on 24 June 2007. The single received airplay on [[Steve Wright (DJ)|Steve Wright]]'s [[BBC Radio 2]] show in the UK, and a new album, ''[[Gone to the Moon]]'', was scheduled for release on the Spectra Records label later on that year. However, the album was postponed, and in February 2008, the three Kajagoogoo members announced plans to reunite with original members singer Limahl and drummer Jez Strode. This was due in part to Bradley Snelling, the organiser of the Retrofest event and the band's new manager. Snelling had succeeded in reuniting the band, arranging their first [[photo shoot]] together in 25 years.\n\nThe band wrote on their official site that \"[t]he atmosphere was relaxed, jovial and, after 25 years, Kajagoogoo, in their original five-piece line-up are back\". After reforming, the band wrote new material, released an EP, and toured extensively throughout Europe, performing first in Denmark on 14 June 2008, at [[Esbjerg]] [[Rock Festival]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.esbjergrockfestival.dk/ |title=Esbjerg Rock Festival |publisher=Esbjergrockfestival.dk |date= |accessdate=14 December 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080620025048/http://www.esbjergrockfestival.dk/ |archive-date=20 June 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref> where they performed the 16 tracks off the remastered edition of ''[[Islands (Kajagoogoo album)|Islands]]'', including encores and B-sides, such as \"Monochromatic\" or \"The Garden\"). Their ''Gone to the Moon'' album, recorded as a three-piece outfit prior to the full reunion, was distributed via the live shows and \"Kajashop\", the band's online store.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kajashop.co.uk/ |title=Kajagoogoo |publisher=Kajashop.co.uk |accessdate=14 December 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130129040329/http://www.kajashop.co.uk/ |archivedate=29 January 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn August 2009 while in the middle of a tour, Kajagoogoo again took to the stage to headline the 'Hobble on The Cobbles' all day music event in [[Aylesbury]] in Buckinghamshire. This was followed in September by a new compilation CD/DVD, released by the band's original label EMI Records, called ''Too Shy \u2013 The Best of Kajagoogoo & Limahl''. It featured two newly recorded tracks, plus a brand new promotional video for \"Space Cadet\", one of the new recordings. Quick to capitalise on the renewed interest in the band, EMI released the \"White Feathers (Manhattan Clique Remixes) EP\" in December 2009.\n\nIn December 2009, Kajagoogoo performed their last remaining UK concert with a return to The Stables venue in Wavendon, Milton Keynes. In March 2010, dPulse Recordings released the Kajagoogoo track \"First Girl on Mars\" as a part of the ''Who Made Your Music?'' benefit CD, released to raise funds and bring awareness to the rights of marginalised women.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.whomadeyourpants.co.uk/ |title=Who Made Your Pants? |publisher=Whomadeyourpants.co.uk |accessdate=14 December 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116204113/http://www.whomadeyourpants.co.uk/ |archivedate=16 January 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> On Saturday 17 July 2010, Kajagoogoo performed at the Midland Music Festival in Tamworth and later performed at the Rewind Festival in Henley-on-Thames in August. Continuing to capitalise on renewed interest in the Kajagoogoo back catalogue, EMI Records released ''So80s Presents Kajagoogoo'' as a part of the ''So Eighties'' series curated by Blank & Jones. The album contains extended mixes of classic Kajagoogoo tracks and was released on CD and digital download format. Also made available digitally in April 2011, Kajagoogoo's ''Gone to the Moon'' album was given a digital release via iTunes.\n\nIn June 2011, Kajagoogoo released their first single as a five piece since 1983. The track, \"Death Defying Headlines\", was released as a digital single as both a single edit and an extended dance remix.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://kajagoogoo.com |title=Kajagoogoo |publisher=Kajagoogoo.com |date= |accessdate=14 December 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn March 2017, bassist Nick Beggs said that Kajagoogoo was no longer active, stating \"We did something about nine years ago, and that was good. It was almost like a kind of revisiting of it for old time\u2019s sake and I felt that we did quite a lot of good with that. But in terms of moving forward, there\u2019s no point in revisiting that project.\"<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=https://progressivemusicreview.wordpress.com/2017/03/09/new-nick-beggs-interview-march-2017/\n|title=New Nick Beggs Interview \u2013 March 2017 |publisher=Progressive Music Review |date= |accessdate=10 March 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn an interview with Cherry Red TV in 2018, Beggs talked about the reunion, stating \"...we reformed and we toured and we recorded an EP and remastered the back catalogue...and at that point I felt that we had done it all.

Quick to capitalise on the renewed interest in the band, EMI released the \"White Feathers (Manhattan Clique Remixes) EP\" in December 2009.\n\nIn December 2009, Kajagoogoo performed their last remaining UK concert with a return to The Stables venue in Wavendon, Milton Keynes. In March 2010, dPulse Recordings released the Kajagoogoo track \"First Girl on Mars\" as a part of the ''Who Made Your Music?'' benefit CD, released to raise funds and bring awareness to the rights of marginalised women.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.whomadeyourpants.co.uk/ |title=Who Made Your Pants? |publisher=Whomadeyourpants.co.uk |accessdate=14 December 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116204113/http://www.whomadeyourpants.co.uk/ |archivedate=16 January 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> On Saturday 17 July 2010, Kajagoogoo performed at the Midland Music Festival in Tamworth, and later performed at the Rewind Festival in Henley-on-Thames in August. Continuing their renewed interest in the Kajagoogoo back catalogue, EMI Records released ''So80s Presents Kajagoogoo'' as a part of the ''So Eighties'' series curated by Blank & Jones. The album contains extended mixes of classic Kajagoogoo tracks and was released on CD and digital download format. Also made available digitally in April 2011, Kajagoogoo's ''Gone to the Moon'' album was given a digital release via iTunes.\n\nIn June 2011, Kajagoogoo released their first single as a five piece since 1983. The track, \"Death Defying Headlines\", was released as a digital single as both a single edit and an extended dance remix.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://kajagoogoo.com |title=Kajagoogoo |publisher=Kajagoogoo.com |date= |accessdate=14 December 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn March 2017, bassist Nick Beggs said that Kajagoogoo was no longer active, stating \"We did something about nine years ago, and that was good.

Towards the end of the 20th century, with a steadily declining electorate and the majority of the party's [[federalism|federalist]] agenda implemented, friction between several wings of the People's Union emerged. In the beginning of the 1990s, [[Bert Anciaux]] became party president and led the party in an ever more [[Progressivism|progressive]] direction, combining the [[Social liberalism|social-liberal]] ideas of his new iD21-movement with the [[Regionalism (politics)|regionalist]] course of the People's Union. These experiments were opposed by the more traditional centre-right party base.\n\nTension rose towards the end of the decade, as [[Geert Bourgeois]], foreman{{Clarify|date=November 2015}} of the traditional and centre-right nationalist wing, was elected chairman by party members, in preference to the incumbent and progressive [[Patrik Vankrunkelsven]]. Factions subsequently clashed multiple times, over the future course of the party and possible support for current [[State reform in Belgium#2001: The fifth state reform|state reform negotiations]]. On 13 October 2001 the party openly split into three factions: the progressive wing around [[Bert Anciaux]], which would later become the [[Sociaal-Liberale Partij|Spirit]] party; the conservative nationalist wing around [[Geert Bourgeois]]; and a centrist group opposing the imminent split. A party referendum was held on the future of the party. The right wing gained a substantial plurality of 47% and inherited the party infrastructure.<ref>{{cite book|title=New Parties in Old Party Systems|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YnLcAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA26|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-964606-7|page=26}}</ref> Since no faction got an absolute majority, however, the name ''Volksunie'' could no longer be used.\n\n===Foundation and the election threshold===\nIn the autumn of 2001, the New Flemish Alliance ({{lang-nl|Nieuw-Vlaamse Alliantie}}, N-VA) was founded. Seven members of parliament from the People's Union joined the new party. The new party council created a party [[manifesto]] and a statement of principles. The first party congress was held in May 2002, voting on a party program and permanent party structures. [[Geert Bourgeois]] was elected chairman.\n\nThe party participated in elections for the first time in the [[2003 Belgian federal election|2003 federal elections]], but struggled with the [[election threshold]] of 5%. This threshold was only reached in [[West Flanders]], the constituency of [[Geert Bourgeois]]. With only one federal representative and no senator, the party lost government funding and faced irrelevance.\n\n===Cartel with CD&V===\nIn February 2004, the N-VA entered into an [[electoral alliance]], commonly known in Belgium as a [[Kartel (electoral alliance)|cartel]], with the [[Christian Democratic and Flemish]] (CD&V) party, the traditionally largest party, which was then in opposition. They joined forces in the [[2004 Belgian regional elections|regional elections in 2004]] and won. Both parties joined the new Flemish government, led by CD&V leader [[Yves Leterme]]. [[Geert Bourgeois]] became a minister, and [[Bart De Wever]] became the new party leader in October 2004.\n\nThe cartel was briefly broken when the former right-wing liberal [[Jean-Marie Dedecker]] left the [[Open Vlaamse Liberalen en Democraten|Open Flemish Liberals and Democrats]] (Open VLD) and entered the N-VA on behalf of the party executive. However, the party congress did not put Dedecker on the election list, instead preferring to continue the cartel with CD&V, who had strongly opposed placing him on a joint cartel list. Dedecker saw this as a vote of no confidence, and left the party after only 10 days, to form his own party, [[Libertair, Direct, Democratisch|List Dedecker]] (LDD). Deputy leader Brepoels, who supported Dedecker, stepped down from the party board afterwards.\n\nIn the Belgian federal election of 2007 the CD&V/N-VA cartel won a major victory again, with a campaign focusing on good governance, state reform and the division of the electoral district [[Brussels-Halle-Vilvoorde]]. The N-VA won five seats in the [[Chamber of Representatives (Belgium)|Chamber of Representatives]] and two seats in the [[Senate (Belgium)|Senate]]. [[Yves Leterme]] initiated coalition talks, which repeatedly stalled (see [[2007\u20132008 Belgian government formation]]). On 20 March 2008, a new federal government was finally assembled. N-VA did not join this government, but gave its support pending state reform.\n\nThe cartel ended definitively on 24 September 2008, due to lack of progression in state reform matters and a different strategy on future negotiations. N-VA left the Flemish Government and gave up its support of Leterme at the federal level.\n\n===Mainstream party===\nIn the [[2009 Belgian regional elections|regional elections of June 2009]], N-VA  won an unexpected 13% of the votes, making them the winner of the elections, along with their old cartel partner CD&V. N-VA subsequently joined the government, led by [[Kris Peeters]] (CD&V). [[Bart De Wever]] chose to remain party leader and appointed [[Geert Bourgeois]] and [[Philippe Muyters]] as ministers in the [[Flemish Government]] and [[Jan Peumans]] as speaker of the [[Flemish Parliament]].\n\nIn December 2018, a political crisis emerged over whether to sign the [[Global Compact for Migration]]; N-VA was against this, whereas the other three parties in the federal government supported it. On 4 December 2018, the Prime Minister of Belgium, [[Charles Michel]], announced that the issue would be taken to parliament for a vote.<ref name=\"The Washington Post\">{{cite web |last1=Casert |first1=Raf |title=Dispute over UN migration pact fractures Belgian government |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/belgian-government-fights-for-survival-over-un-migrants-pact/2018/12/04/6fca1aa0-f79c-11e8-8642-c9718a256cbd_story.html |publisher=The Washington Post |date=4 December 2018}}</ref> On 5 December, parliament voted 106 to 36 in favor of backing the agreement.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.france24.com/en/20181205-belgian-pm-wins-backing-un-migration-pact|title=Belgian PM wins backing for UN migration pact|date=5 December 2018|work=France 24|accessdate=6 December 2018}}</ref> Michel stated that he would endorse the pact on behalf of parliament, not on behalf of the divided government.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.timesnownews.com/international/article/belgian-pm-charles-michel-wins-backing-for-un-migration-pact/326659|title=Belgian PM Charles Michel wins backing for UN migration pact|work=www.timesnownews.com|accessdate=6 December 2018}}</ref> Consequently, N-VA quit the federal government; the other three parties continue as a minority government ([[Michel II Government|Michel II]]).\n\nDuring the [[2019 Belgian federal election|2019 federal elections]] the party again polled in first place in the Flemish region but saw a decline in vote share for the first time, falling to 25.6% of the Flemish vote.\n\n==Foundation and ideology==\nThe New Flemish Alliance is a relatively young political party, founded in the autumn of 2001. Being one of the successors of the Volksunie (1954\u20132001), it is, however, based on an established political tradition. The N-VA works towards the same goal as its predecessor: to redefine Flemish nationalism in a contemporary setting. Party leader De Wever calls himself a conservative and a nationalist.<ref>[http://www.trouw.nl/achtergrond/deverdieping/article3035462.ece/_rsquo_Laat_Belgie_maar_rustig___verdampen_rsquo__.html Trouw: \"Laat Belgie maar rustig verdampen\"], last seen April 8th, 2010.</ref>\n\nThe N-VA has previously argued for a Flemish Republic as a member state of a democratic [[Federal Europe|European confederation]]. The party believes that the challenges of the 21st century can best be answered by strong communities and by well-developed international co-operation, a position which is reflected in their tagline: \"Necessary in Flanders, useful in Europe.\" ({{lang-nl|Nodig in Vlaanderen, nuttig in Europa}}.)\n\nLike its [[People's Union (Belgium)|People's Union]] predecessor, a label for the political orientation of the N-VA was difficult to find as the party initially combined [[socially liberal]], left- and right-wing policies. In its 2009 election programme for Flanders, the N-VA described itself as [[Economic liberalism|economically liberal]] and [[Environmentalism|ecologically green]]. The party supported [[public transport]], [[open source software]], [[renewable energy]] and taxing cars by the number of kilometres driven. It wanted more aid for developing countries and more compulsory measures to require that immigrants learn Dutch.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} The party has generally been supportive of LGBT rights.<ref>{{citeweb|url=https://english.n-va.be/news/high-profile-forum-on-lgbt-rights-in-brussels|title=High profile forum on LGBT rights in Brussels |work=N-VA|access-date= 24 February 2020|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n\nIn recent years, the party has been described as becoming more of a [[conservative]] party, as opposed to a progressive nationalist movement, and moving ideologically further to the right under the influence of [[Bart De Wever]] and [[Theo Francken]] by adopting tougher stances on immigration, integration of minorities, security, crime and terrorism.<ref>{{citeweb|url=https://www.politico.eu/article/bart-de-wever-jan-jambon-belgian-right-wing-party-fends-off-racism-accusations/|title=Belgian right wing party fends off racism accusations. |work=Politico|access-date=1 January 2018|language=en-GB}}</ref><ref name=\"euobserver\">{{citeweb|url=https://euobserver.com/eu-elections/123886/|title=Belgians\u2019 pride in the EU quells Euroscepticism. |work=euobserver|access-date=1 January 2019|language=en-GB}}</ref> In 2018, the party opposed the [[Global Compact for Migration]] and subsequently withdrew its participation in the Belgian government in protest of its passing.<ref name=\"The Washington Post\"/> Some commentators have attributed these shifts as a response to a revival in support for the Flemish nationalist [[Vlaams Belang]], which also campaigned against the Migration Compact.<ref>{{citeweb|url=https://theglobalobservatory.org/2018/12/global-compact-migration-missed-opportunity-europe/|title=Global Compact for Migration \u2013 A Missed Opportunity for Europe.work=theglobalobservatory|access-date=2 January 2019|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n\nIn terms of foreign policy the N-VA\u2019s stance on the [[European Union]] began as strongly [[pro-European]] in character and in 2010 the party called for \u201can ever stronger and more united Europe.\u201d However, the party has since shifted to a position of [[soft Euroscepticism]] by no longer endorsing a vision of a federal Europe, calling for more democratic reform of the EU and stating that economically unstable nations should leave the [[Eurozone]].<ref name=\"euobserver\"/><ref name=\"blogs.lse.ac.uk\"/> The party is critical of the EU's stance on illegal immigration (in particular its handling of the migrant crisis) and the role played by NGOs in picking up migrants. The N-VA argues that the EU should emulate the Australian system of border protection to reinforce its external border and work with nations outside of Europe to stem the flow of illegal migrants arriving by sea.<ref name=\"knack.be\">https://www.knack.be/nieuws/belgie/francken-wil-naar-australisch-asielmodel-0-asielverzoeken-in-brussel/article-normal-1080799.html </ref>\n\nAt European level, the N-VA is part of the [[European Free Alliance]] (EFA), a [[European political party]] consisting of [[Regionalism (politics)|regionalist]], pro-[[independence]] and [[Political parties of minorities|minority interest]] political parties, of which the [[People's Union (Belgium)|People's Union]] was a founder member. During the [[Seventh European Parliament|7th European Parliament]] of 2009\u20132014, the N-VA was a member of [[The Greens\u2013European Free Alliance]] (Greens/EFA) group in the European Parliament. However, following the [[2014 European Parliament election in Belgium|2014 European elections]], the N-VA announced it was moving to a new group and chose the [[European Conservatives and Reformists]] (ECR)<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.standaard.be/cnt/dmf20140618_01146790|title= N-VA kiest voor ECR-fractie in Europees Parlement |first= Johan |last= Van Overtveldt |date= 2014-06-18 |work= standaard.be |language= Dutch |trans-title= N-VA chooses ECR Group in the European Parliament |accessdate= 2014-06-18}}</ref> over the [[Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe]].\n\n==Party chairmen==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | Name !!

In February 2004 they formed an electoral alliance (cartel) with the [[Christian Democratic and Flemish]] party (CD&V). The cartel won the elections for the Flemish Parliament. The N-VA received a total of 6 seats. However, on 21 September 2008 the N-VA lost its faith in the federal government and the following day minister [[Geert Bourgeois]] resigned. In a press conference he confirmed the end of the CD&V/N-VA cartel.\n\nIn the [[2004 European Parliament election in Belgium|2004 European elections]], N-VA had 1 MEP elected as part of the cartel with CD&V.\n\nIn the 10 June 2007 [[2007 Belgian federal election|federal elections]], the cartel won 30 out of 150 seats in the [[Chamber of Representatives (Belgium)|Chamber of Representatives]] and 9 out of 40 seats in the [[Senate (Belgium)|Senate]].\n\nIn the [[2009 Belgian regional elections|regional elections of 11 June 2009]], N-VA (now on its own after the split of the cartel with [[Christian Democratic and Flemish|CD&V]]) won an unexpected 13% of the votes, making them the winner of the elections along with their former cartel partner. In the [[2009 European Parliament election in Belgium|2009 European elections]] held on the same day, the N-VA had one MEP elected.\n\nIn the [[2010 Belgian federal election|2010 federal elections]], N-VA became the largest party of Flanders and of Belgium altogether.\n\nIn the [[2014 Belgian federal election|2014 federal elections]], N-VA increased their dominant position, taking votes and seats from the far-right [[Flemish Interest]]. In the simultaneous [[2014 Belgian regional elections|2014 regional elections]] and [[2014 European Parliament election in Belgium|2014 European elections]], the N-VA also became the largest party in the [[Flemish Parliament]] and in the Belgian delegation to the [[European Parliament]].\n\nIn the [[2019 Belgian federal election|2019 federal elections]] the party remained in first place in the Chamber of Representatives, European Parliament and Flemish Parliament, but saw a slight decline in vote share for the first time, obtaining 16.03% of the votes in the Federal Parliament. This was in part due to a sudden upsurge in support for the [[Flemish Interest]].\n\n[[File:Kamer-1978-2014.png|thumb|200px|The six biggest Flemish political parties and their results for the House of Representatives (Kamer).

Towards the end of the 20th century, with a steadily declining electorate and the majority of the party's [[federalism|federalist]] agenda implemented, friction between several wings of the People's Union emerged. In the beginning of the 1990s, [[Bert Anciaux]] became party president and led the party in an ever more [[Progressivism|progressive]] direction, combining the [[Social liberalism|social-liberal]] ideas of his new iD21-movement with the [[Regionalism (politics)|regionalist]] course of the People's Union. These experiments were opposed by the more traditional centre-right party base.\n\nTension rose towards the end of the decade, as [[Geert Bourgeois]], foreman{{Clarify|date=November 2015}} of the traditional and centre-right nationalist wing, was elected chairman by party members, in preference to the incumbent and progressive [[Patrik Vankrunkelsven]]. Factions subsequently clashed multiple times, over the future course of the party and possible support for current [[State reform in Belgium#2001: The fifth state reform|state reform negotiations]]. On 13 October 2001 the party openly split into three factions: the progressive wing around [[Bert Anciaux]], which would later become the [[Sociaal-Liberale Partij|Spirit]] party; the conservative nationalist wing around [[Geert Bourgeois]]; and a centrist group opposing the imminent split. A party referendum was held on the future of the party. The right wing gained a substantial plurality of 47% and inherited the party infrastructure.<ref>{{cite book|title=New Parties in Old Party Systems|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YnLcAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA26|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-964606-7|page=26}}</ref> Since no faction got an absolute majority, however, the name ''Volksunie'' could no longer be used.\n\n===Foundation and the election threshold===\nIn the autumn of 2001, the New Flemish Alliance ({{lang-nl|Nieuw-Vlaamse Alliantie}}, N-VA) was founded. Seven members of parliament from the People's Union joined the new party. The new party council created a party [[manifesto]] and a statement of principles. The first party congress was held in May 2002, voting on a party program and permanent party structures. [[Geert Bourgeois]] was elected chairman.\n\nThe party participated in elections for the first time in the [[2003 Belgian federal election|2003 federal elections]], but struggled with the [[election threshold]] of 5%. This threshold was only reached in [[West Flanders]], the constituency of [[Geert Bourgeois]]. With only one federal representative and no senator, the party lost government funding and faced irrelevance.\n\n===Cartel with CD&V===\nIn February 2004, the N-VA entered into an [[electoral alliance]], commonly known in Belgium as a [[Kartel (electoral alliance)|cartel]], with the [[Christian Democratic and Flemish]] (CD&V) party, the traditionally largest party, which was then in opposition. They joined forces in the [[2004 Belgian regional elections|regional elections in 2004]] and won. Both parties joined the new Flemish government, led by CD&V leader [[Yves Leterme]]. [[Geert Bourgeois]] became a minister, and [[Bart De Wever]] became the new party leader in October 2004.\n\nThe cartel was briefly broken when the former right-wing liberal [[Jean-Marie Dedecker]] left the [[Open Vlaamse Liberalen en Democraten|Open Flemish Liberals and Democrats]] (Open VLD) and entered the N-VA on behalf of the party executive. However, the party congress did not put Dedecker on the election list, instead preferring to continue the cartel with CD&V, who had strongly opposed placing him on a joint cartel list. Dedecker saw this as a vote of no confidence, and left the party after only 10 days, to form his own party, [[Libertair, Direct, Democratisch|List Dedecker]] (LDD). Deputy leader Brepoels, who supported Dedecker, stepped down from the party board afterwards.\n\nIn the Belgian federal election of 2007 the CD&V/N-VA cartel won a major victory again, with a campaign focusing on good governance, state reform and the division of the electoral district [[Brussels-Halle-Vilvoorde]]. The N-VA won five seats in the [[Chamber of Representatives (Belgium)|Chamber of Representatives]] and two seats in the [[Senate (Belgium)|Senate]]. [[Yves Leterme]] initiated coalition talks, which repeatedly stalled (see [[2007\u20132008 Belgian government formation]]). On 20 March 2008, a new federal government was finally assembled. N-VA did not join this government, but gave its support pending state reform.\n\nThe cartel ended definitively on 24 September 2008, due to lack of progression in state reform matters and a different strategy on future negotiations. N-VA left the Flemish Government and gave up its support of Leterme at the federal level.\n\n===Mainstream party===\nIn the [[2009 Belgian regional elections|regional elections of June 2009]], N-VA  won an unexpected 13% of the votes, making them the winner of the elections, along with their old cartel partner CD&V. N-VA subsequently joined the government, led by [[Kris Peeters]] (CD&V). [[Bart De Wever]] chose to remain party leader and appointed [[Geert Bourgeois]] and [[Philippe Muyters]] as ministers in the [[Flemish Government]] and [[Jan Peumans]] as speaker of the [[Flemish Parliament]].\n\nIn December 2018, a political crisis emerged over whether to sign the [[Global Compact for Migration]]; N-VA was against this, whereas the other three parties in the federal government supported it. On 4 December 2018, the Prime Minister of Belgium, [[Charles Michel]], announced that the issue would be taken to parliament for a vote.<ref name=\"The Washington Post\">{{cite web |last1=Casert |first1=Raf |title=Dispute over UN migration pact fractures Belgian government |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/belgian-government-fights-for-survival-over-un-migrants-pact/2018/12/04/6fca1aa0-f79c-11e8-8642-c9718a256cbd_story.html |publisher=The Washington Post |date=4 December 2018}}</ref> On 5 December, parliament voted 106 to 36 in favor of backing the agreement.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.france24.com/en/20181205-belgian-pm-wins-backing-un-migration-pact|title=Belgian PM wins backing for UN migration pact|date=5 December 2018|work=France 24|accessdate=6 December 2018}}</ref> Michel stated that he would endorse the pact on behalf of parliament, not on behalf of the divided government.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.timesnownews.com/international/article/belgian-pm-charles-michel-wins-backing-for-un-migration-pact/326659|title=Belgian PM Charles Michel wins backing for UN migration pact|work=www.timesnownews.com|accessdate=6 December 2018}}</ref> Consequently, N-VA quit the federal government; the other three parties continue as a minority government ([[Michel II Government|Michel II]]).\n\nDuring the [[2019 Belgian federal election|2019 federal elections]] the party again polled in first place in the Flemish region but saw a decline in vote share for the first time, falling to 25.6% of the Flemish vote.\n\n==Foundation and ideology==\nThe New Flemish Alliance is a relatively young political party, founded in the autumn of 2001. Being one of the successors of the Volksunie (1954\u20132001), it is, however, based on an established political tradition. The N-VA works towards the same goal as its predecessor: to redefine Flemish nationalism in a contemporary setting. Party leader De Wever calls himself a conservative and a nationalist.<ref>[http://www.trouw.nl/achtergrond/deverdieping/article3035462.ece/_rsquo_Laat_Belgie_maar_rustig___verdampen_rsquo__.html Trouw: \"Laat Belgie maar rustig verdampen\"], last seen April 8th, 2010.</ref>\n\nThe N-VA has previously argued for a Flemish Republic as a member state of a democratic [[Federal Europe|European confederation]]. The party believes that the challenges of the 21st century can best be answered by strong communities and by well-developed international co-operation, a position which is reflected in their tagline: \"Necessary in Flanders, useful in Europe.\" ({{lang-nl|Nodig in Vlaanderen, nuttig in Europa}}.)\n\nLike its [[People's Union (Belgium)|People's Union]] predecessor, a label for the political orientation of the N-VA was difficult to find as the party initially combined [[socially liberal]], left- and right-wing policies. In its 2009 election programme for Flanders, the N-VA described itself as [[Economic liberalism|economically liberal]] and [[Environmentalism|ecologically green]]. The party supported [[public transport]], [[open source software]], [[renewable energy]] and taxing cars by the number of kilometres driven. It wanted more aid for developing countries and more compulsory measures to require that immigrants learn Dutch.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} The party has generally been supportive of LGBT rights.<ref>{{citeweb|url=https://english.n-va.be/news/high-profile-forum-on-lgbt-rights-in-brussels|title=High profile forum on LGBT rights in Brussels |work=N-VA|access-date= 24 February 2020|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n\nIn recent years, the party has been described as becoming more of a [[conservative]] party, as opposed to a progressive nationalist movement, and moving ideologically further to the right under the influence of [[Bart De Wever]] and [[Theo Francken]] by adopting tougher stances on immigration, integration of minorities, security, crime and terrorism.<ref>{{citeweb|url=https://www.politico.eu/article/bart-de-wever-jan-jambon-belgian-right-wing-party-fends-off-racism-accusations/|title=Belgian right wing party fends off racism accusations. |work=Politico|access-date=1 January 2018|language=en-GB}}</ref><ref name=\"euobserver\">{{citeweb|url=https://euobserver.com/eu-elections/123886/|title=Belgians\u2019 pride in the EU quells Euroscepticism. |work=euobserver|access-date=1 January 2019|language=en-GB}}</ref> In 2018, the party opposed the [[Global Compact for Migration]] and subsequently withdrew its participation in the Belgian government in protest of its passing.<ref name=\"The Washington Post\"/> Some commentators have attributed these shifts as a response to a revival in support for the Flemish nationalist [[Vlaams Belang]], which also campaigned against the Migration Compact.<ref>{{citeweb|url=https://theglobalobservatory.org/2018/12/global-compact-migration-missed-opportunity-europe/|title=Global Compact for Migration \u2013 A Missed Opportunity for Europe.work=theglobalobservatory|access-date=2 January 2019|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n\nIn terms of foreign policy the N-VA\u2019s stance on the [[European Union]] began as strongly [[pro-European]] in character and in 2010 the party called for \u201can ever stronger and more united Europe.\u201d However, the party has since shifted to a position of [[soft Euroscepticism]] by no longer endorsing a vision of a federal Europe, calling for more democratic reform of the EU and stating that economically unstable nations should leave the [[Eurozone]].<ref name=\"euobserver\"/><ref name=\"blogs.lse.ac.uk\"/> The party is critical of the EU's stance on illegal immigration (in particular its handling of the migrant crisis) and the role played by NGOs in picking up migrants. The N-VA argues that the EU should emulate the Australian system of border protection to reinforce its external border and work with nations outside of Europe to stem the flow of illegal migrants arriving by sea.<ref name=\"knack.be\">https://www.knack.be/nieuws/belgie/francken-wil-naar-australisch-asielmodel-0-asielverzoeken-in-brussel/article-normal-1080799.html </ref>\n\nAt European level, the N-VA is part of the [[European Free Alliance]] (EFA), a [[European political party]] consisting of [[Regionalism (politics)|regionalist]], pro-[[independence]] and [[Political parties of minorities|minority interest]] political parties, of which the [[People's Union (Belgium)|People's Union]] was a founder member. During the [[Seventh European Parliament|7th European Parliament]] of 2009\u20132014, the N-VA was a member of [[The Greens\u2013European Free Alliance]] (Greens/EFA) group in the European Parliament. However, following the [[2014 European Parliament election in Belgium|2014 European elections]], the N-VA announced it was moving to a new group and chose the [[European Conservatives and Reformists]] (ECR)<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.standaard.be/cnt/dmf20140618_01146790|title= N-VA kiest voor ECR-fractie in Europees Parlement |first= Johan |last= Van Overtveldt |date= 2014-06-18 |work= standaard.be |language= Dutch |trans-title= N-VA chooses ECR Group in the European Parliament |accessdate= 2014-06-18}}</ref> over the [[Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe]].\n\n==Party chairmen==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | Name !!

In February 2004 they formed an electoral alliance (cartel) with the [[Christian Democratic and Flemish]] party (CD&V). The cartel won the elections for the Flemish Parliament. The N-VA received a total of 6 seats. However, on 21 September 2008 the N-VA lost its faith in the federal government and the following day minister [[Geert Bourgeois]] resigned. In a press conference he confirmed the end of the CD&V/N-VA cartel.\n\nIn the [[2004 European Parliament election in Belgium|2004 European elections]], N-VA had 1 MEP elected as part of the cartel with CD&V.\n\nIn the 10 June 2007 [[2007 Belgian federal election|federal elections]], the cartel won 30 out of 150 seats in the [[Chamber of Representatives (Belgium)|Chamber of Representatives]] and 9 out of 40 seats in the [[Senate (Belgium)|Senate]].\n\nIn the [[2009 Belgian regional elections|regional elections of 11 June 2009]], N-VA (now on its own after the split of the cartel with [[Christian Democratic and Flemish|CD&V]]) won an unexpected 13% of the votes, making them the winner of the elections along with their former cartel partner. In the [[2009 European Parliament election in Belgium|2009 European elections]] held on the same day, the N-VA had one MEP elected.\n\nIn the [[2010 Belgian federal election|2010 federal elections]], N-VA became the largest party of Flanders and of Belgium altogether.\n\nIn the [[2014 Belgian federal election|2014 federal elections]], N-VA increased their dominant position, taking votes and seats from the far-right [[Flemish Interest]]. In the simultaneous [[2014 Belgian regional elections|2014 regional elections]] and [[2014 European Parliament election in Belgium|2014 European elections]], the N-VA also became the largest party in the [[Flemish Parliament]] and in the Belgian delegation to the [[European Parliament]].\n\nIn the [[2019 Belgian federal election|2019 federal elections]] the party remained in first place in the Chamber of Representatives, European Parliament and Flemish Parliament, but saw a slight decline in vote share for the first time, obtaining 16.03% of the votes in the Federal Parliament. This was in part due to a sudden upsurge in support for the [[Flemish Interest]].\n\n[[File:Kamer-1978-2014.png|thumb|200px|The six biggest Flemish political parties and their results for the House of Representatives (Kamer).

Growing up, he took piano lessons at the insistence of his mother. After dropping out of [[high school]] to pursue a musical career, Joel took part in two short-lived bands, [[The Hassles]] and [[Attila (rock band)|Attila]], before signing a record deal with Family Productions and kicking off a solo career in 1971 with his first release, ''[[Cold Spring Harbor (album)|Cold Spring Harbor]]''. In 1972, Joel caught the attention of [[Columbia Records]] after a live radio performance of the song \"[[Captain Jack (Billy Joel song)|Captain Jack]]\" became popular in Philadelphia, prompting him to sign a new record deal with the company and release his second album, ''[[Piano Man (Billy Joel album)|Piano Man]]'', in 1973. After releasing the albums ''[[Streetlife Serenade]]'' and ''[[Turnstiles (album)|Turnstiles]]'' in 1974 and 1976 respectively, Joel released his critical and commercial breakthrough album, ''[[The Stranger (album)|The Stranger]]'', in 1977. This album became Columbia's best-selling release, selling over 10 million copies and spawning several hit singles, including \"[[Just the Way You Are (Billy Joel song)|Just the Way You Are]]\", \"[[Movin' Out (Anthony's Song)]]\", \"[[Only the Good Die Young]]\", and \"[[She's Always a Woman]]\"; another song on this album, \"[[Scenes from an Italian Restaurant]]\", is Joel's favorite of his own songs and has become a staple of his live shows.<ref>{{Cite web |url= https://www.newsday.com/entertainment/music/billy-joel/billy-joel-talks-scenes-from-an-italian-restaurant-i-couldn-t-do-a-show-without-it-1.10695315|title=Joel on 'Scenes': I couldn't do a show without it| website= Newsday| language= en| access-date= 2019-06-06}}</ref>\n\nJoel's next album, ''[[52nd Street (album)|52nd Street]]'', was released in 1978 and became his first album to peak at No.1 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart. Joel released his seventh studio album, ''[[Glass Houses (album)|Glass Houses]]'', in 1980 in an attempt to further establish himself as a rock and roll artist; this release featured \"[[It's Still Rock and Roll to Me]]\" (Joel's first single to top the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart), \"[[You May Be Right (song)|You May Be Right]]\", \"[[Don't Ask Me Why (Billy Joel song)|Don't Ask Me Why]]\", and \"[[Sometimes a Fantasy]]\". His next album, ''[[The Nylon Curtain]]'', was released in 1982, and stemmed from a desire from Joel to create more lyrically and melodically ambitious music. ''[[An Innocent Man]]'', released in 1983, served as an homage to genres of music which Joel had grown up with in the 1950s, such as [[rhythm and blues]] and [[doo-wop]]; this release featured \"[[Uptown Girl]]\" and \"[[The Longest Time]]\", two of his best-known songs today. After releasing the albums ''[[The Bridge (Billy Joel album)|The Bridge]]'' and ''[[Storm Front (album)|Storm Front]]'' in 1986 and 1989 respectively, Joel released his twelfth and to date final studio album, ''[[River of Dreams]]'', in 1993. He went on to release ''[[Fantasies and Delusions]]'', a 2001 album featuring [[classical music|classical]] compositions composed by Joel and performed by British-Korean pianist [[Richard Hyung-ki Joo]]. Joel also provided voiceover work in 1988 for the [[animated film|animated]] [[Walt Disney Feature Animation|Disney]] film, ''[[Oliver & Company]]'', in which he played the character Dodger, and contributed to the soundtracks to several different films, including ''[[Easy Money (1983 film)|Easy Money]]'', ''[[Ruthless People]]'', and ''[[Honeymoon in Vegas]]''.\n\nAcross the 20 years of his solo career, Joel produced 33 Top 40 hits in the U.S., all of which he wrote himself,<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/10/27/thirty-three-hit-wonder |title=Thirty-Three-Hit Wonder |website=newyorker.com |accessdate= July 19, 2018}}</ref> and three of which (\"It's Still Rock and Roll to Me\", \"[[Tell Her About It]]\", and \"[[We Didn't Start the Fire]]\") managed to peak at the top of the [[Billboard Hot 100]] charts. Joel has been nominated for 23 [[Grammy Award]]s, winning five of them, including Album of the Year for ''52nd Street''. Joel was inducted into the [[Songwriters Hall of Fame]] (1992), the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] (1999),<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.rockhall.com/inductees/billy-joel |title=Billy Joel |website=Rock & Roll Hall of Fame| language= en |access-date= January 19, 2017}}</ref> and the [[Long Island Music Hall of Fame]] (2006).

Since the advent of his solo career, Joel has held a successful touring career, holding live performances across the globe in which he sings several of his written songs. In 1987, he became one of the very first artists to hold a rock and roll tour in the [[Soviet Union]] following the country's alleviation of the ban on rock and roll music. Despite largely retiring from writing and releasing pop music following the release of ''River of Dreams'', he continues to tour; he frequently performs at [[Madison Square Garden]] in [[Manhattan]]. Joel has been in several relationships, including marriages to Elizabeth Weber Small, model [[Christie Brinkley]], and chef [[Katie Lee (chef)|Katie Lee]]; since 2015, he has been married to Alexis Roderick, his fourth spouse. He also has three daughters: [[Alexa Ray Joel]] with Brinkley, and Della Rose and Remy Anne with Roderick.\n\n== Early life, family and education ==\nWilliam Martin Joel was born in [[the Bronx]], New York City, New York, on May 9, 1949.

Guitarist Al Hertzberg was replaced by Don Evans, and bassist Larry Russell by Patrick McDonald, himself replaced in late 1974 by [[Doug Stegmeyer]], who stayed with Joel until 1989. Rhys Clark returned as drummer and Tom Whitehorse as banjoist and pedal steel player; Johnny Almond joined as saxophonist and keyboardist. The band toured the U.S. and Canada extensively, appearing on popular music shows. Joel's songwriting began attracting more attention; in 1974 [[Helen Reddy]] recorded \"You're My Home\" (''Piano Man'').\n\n===1974\u20131977: ''Streetlife Serenade'' and ''Turnstiles''===\nIn 1974, Joel recorded his second Columbia album in Los Angeles, ''[[Streetlife Serenade]]''.

Produced by [[James William Guercio]] (then [[Chicago (band)|Chicago]]'s producer), ''Turnstiles'' was first recorded at [[Caribou Ranch]] with members of [[Elton John]]'s band. Dissatisfied with the result, Joel re-recorded the songs and produced the album himself.\n\n\"[[Say Goodbye to Hollywood]]\" was a minor hit; [[Ronnie Spector]] recorded a cover as did [[Nigel Olsson]], then drummer with Elton John. In a 2008 radio interview, Joel said that he no longer performs the song because singing it in its high original key \"shreds\" his [[vocal cords]]; however, he did finally play it live for the first time since 1982 when he sang it at the [[Hollywood Bowl]] in May 2014. Although never released as a single, \"[[New York State of Mind]]\" became one of Joel's best-known songs; [[Barbra Streisand]] recorded a cover and [[Tony Bennett]] performed it as a duet with Joel on ''[[Playing with My Friends: Bennett Sings the Blues]]''. Other notable songs from the album include \"[[Summer, Highland Falls]]\"; \"[[Miami 2017 (Seen the Lights Go Out on Broadway)]]\"; \"Say Goodbye to Hollywood\" (a live version of which became a Top 40 hit); and \"[[Prelude/Angry Young Man]],\" a concert mainstay.\n\n===1977\u20131979: ''The Stranger'' and ''52nd Street'' ===\nColumbia Records introduced Joel to [[Phil Ramone]], who produced all of Joel's studio albums from ''[[The Stranger (album)|The Stranger]] ''(1977) to ''[[The Bridge (Billy Joel album)|The Bridge]]'' (1986).

Joel thought these labels were unfair and insulting, and with ''[[Glass Houses (album)|Glass Houses]]'', he tried to record an album that proved that he could rock harder than his critics gave him credit for, occasionally imitating and referring to the style of [[New wave music|new wave]] rock music that was starting to become popular at the time. On the front cover of the album, Joel is pictured in a leather jacket, about to throw a rock at a glass house (referring to the adage that \"people who live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones\").\n\n''Glass Houses'' spent six weeks at No. 1 on the ''Billboard'' chart and yielded such hits as \"[[You May Be Right (song)|You May Be Right]]\" (used as the theme song, covered by [[Southside Johnny]], for the CBS mid-1990s sitcom ''[[Dave's World]]'') (No. 7, May 1980), \"[[Don't Ask Me Why (Billy Joel song)|Don't Ask Me Why]]\" (No. 19, September 1980), \"[[Sometimes a Fantasy]]\" (No. 36, November 1980) and \"[[It's Still Rock and Roll to Me]]\", which became Joel's first ''Billboard'' number-one single (for two weeks) in July 1980. \"It's Still Rock and Roll to Me\" spent 11 weeks in the top 10 of the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and was the 7th biggest hit of 1980 according to American Top 40.

It also won the [[American Music Award]] for Favorite Album, Pop/Rock category. The album's closing song, \"Through The Long Night\" ([[B-side]] of the \"It's Still Rock & Roll to Me\" single), was a lullaby that featured Joel harmonizing with himself in a song he says was inspired by [[The Beatles]]' \"[[Yes It Is]]\".<ref name=\"unauthorized\" /> In a recorded Masterclass at the University of Pennsylvania, Joel later recollected that he had written to the Beatles asking them how to get started in the music industry. In response, he received a pamphlet about Beatles merchandise. This later led to the idea of Joel conducting Q&A sessions around the world answering questions that people had about the music industry.<ref>{{citation |last1=Joel|first1=Billy|title=Billy Joel \u2013 Masterclass concert (Part 1) \u2013 2001|publisher=University of Pennsylvania}}</ref>\n\nHis next release, ''[[Songs in the Attic]]'', was composed of live performances of less well-known songs from the beginning of his career. It was recorded during larger US arenas and intimate night club shows in June and July 1980. This release introduced many fans, who discovered Joel when ''The Stranger'' became a smash in 1977, to many of his earlier compositions. The album reached No. 8 on the ''Billboard'' chart and produced two hit singles: \"Say Goodbye to Hollywood\" (No. 17), and \"She's Got a Way\" (No. 23). It sold over 3&nbsp;million copies. Although not as successful as some of his previous albums, the album was still considered a success by Joel.<ref name=\"unauthorized\" />\n\nThe next wave of Joel's career commenced with the recording of his next studio album, ''[[The Nylon Curtain]]''. With ''The Nylon Curtain'', Joel became more ambitious with his songwriting, trying his hand at writing topical songs like \"Allentown\" and \"Goodnight Saigon\". Joel has stated that he wanted the album to communicate his feelings about [[the American Dream]] and how changes in American politics during the [[Ronald Reagan#First term.2C 1981.E2.80.9385|Reagan years]] meant that \"all of a sudden you weren't going to be able to inherit [the kind of life] your old man had.\"<ref name=\"ncvideo\">{{cite video |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pqc4U8uWTRU |title=Billy Joel on The Nylon Curtain&nbsp;\u2013 from The Complete Albums Collection |publisher=YouTube}}</ref> He also tried to be more ambitious in his use of the recording studio. Joel said that he wanted to \"create a sonic masterpiece\" on ''The Nylon Curtain''. So he spent more time in the studio, crafting the sound of the album, than he had on any previous album.<ref name=\"ncvideo\" /> Production of ''The Nylon Curtain'' began in the fall of 1981. However, production was temporarily delayed when Joel was involved in a serious motorcycle accident on [[Long Island]] on April 15, 1982, severely injuring his hands. Still, Joel quickly recovered from his injuries, and the album only ended up being delayed by a few months.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ultimateclassicrock.com/billy-joel-motorcycle-accident/|title=35 Years Ago: Billy Joel Injures Both Hands in Motorcycle Accident|website=Ultimate Classic Rock|accessdate=July 14, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 1982, he embarked on a brief tour in support of the album. From one of the final shows of the tour, Joel made his first video special, ''Live from Long Island'', which was recorded at the [[Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum]] in [[Uniondale, New York]] on December 30, 1982. It was originally broadcast on [[HBO]] in 1983 before it became available on VHS.\n\n''The Nylon Curtain'' went to No. 7 on the charts, partially due to heavy airplay on MTV for the videos to the singles \"[[Allentown (song)|Allentown]]\" and \"[[Pressure (Billy Joel song)|Pressure]]\". \"Allentown\" spent six weeks at a peak position of No. 17 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100, making it one of the most-played radio songs of 1982, pushing it into 1983's year-end Top 70, and making it the most successful song from ''The Nylon Curtain'' album, besting \"Pressure\" which peaked at No. 20 (where it resided for three weeks) and \"[[Goodnight Saigon]]\" which reached No. 56 on U.S. charts.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=7694 |title=Goodnight Saigon by Billy Joel|work= Songfacts |publisher=songfacts.com |accessdate=November 8, 2010}}</ref>\n\n===1983\u20131988: ''An Innocent Man'' and ''The Bridge'' ===\n{{more citations needed|section|date=April 2019}}\nJoel's next album moved away from the serious themes of ''The Nylon Curtain'' and struck a much lighter tone.

The album itself reached No. 4 on the charts and No. 2 in UK. It also boasted six top-30 singles, the most of any album in Joel's catalog. The album was well received by critics, with [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]], senior editor for AllMusic, describing Joel as being \"in top form as a craftsman throughout the record, effortlessly spinning out infectious, memorable melodies in a variety of styles.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Thomas |first=Stephen |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/an-innocent-man-mw0000190510 |title=An Innocent Man&nbsp;\u2013 Billy Joel : Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards |website=AllMusic |accessdate=September 12, 2012}}</ref>\n\nAt the time that the album was released, [[WCBS-FM]] began playing \"[[Uptown Girl]]\" both in regular rotation and on the ''Doo Wop Live''.<ref>YouTube (uploaded April 6, 2008).</ref><ref>Billy Joel's Interview on Howard Stern. 2011.{{which|date=October 2012}}</ref> The song became a worldwide hit upon its release.

When Brinkley went to visit Joel after being asked to star in the video, the first thing Joel said to her upon opening his door was \"I don't dance\".

That summer, \"[[Leave a Tender Moment Alone]]\" was released and it hit No. 27 while \"[[Keeping the Faith (song)|Keeping the Faith]]\" peaked at No. 18 in January 1985. In the video for \"Keeping the Faith\", Christie Brinkley also plays the \"redhead girl in a Chevrolet\". ''An Innocent Man'' was also nominated for the Album of the Year Grammy, but lost to [[Michael Jackson]]'s ''[[Thriller (Michael Jackson album)|Thriller]]''.\n\nJoel participated in the [[USA for Africa]] \"[[We Are the World]]\" project in 1985.\n\nFollowing the success of ''An Innocent Man'', Joel was asked about releasing an album of his most successful singles. This was not the first time this topic had come up, but Joel had initially considered \"Greatest Hits\" albums as marking the end of one's career. This time he agreed, and ''[[Greatest Hits (Billy Joel albums)|Greatest Hits Vol. 1 and 2]]'' was released as a four-sided album and two-CD set, with the songs in the order in which they were released. The new songs \"[[You're Only Human (Second Wind)]]\" and \"[[The Night Is Still Young (Billy Joel song)|The Night Is Still Young]]\" were recorded and released as singles to support the album; both reached the top 40, peaking at No. 9 and No. 34, respectively. ''Greatest Hits'' was highly successful and it has since been certified [[Diamond album|double diamond]] by the [[RIAA]], with over 11.5&nbsp;million copies (23&nbsp;million units) sold. It is one of the [[List of best-selling albums in the United States|best-selling albums in American music history]], according to the RIAA.\n\nCoinciding with the ''Greatest Hits'' album release, Joel released a two-volume ''Video Album'' that was a compilation of the promotional videos he had recorded from 1977 to the present time. Along with videos for the new singles off the ''Greatest Hits'' album, Joel also recorded a video for his first hit, \"Piano Man\", for this project.\n\nJoel's next album, ''[[The Bridge (Billy Joel album)|The Bridge]]'' (1986), did not achieve the level of success of his previous albums, but it yielded the hits \"[[A Matter of Trust]]\" and \"[[Modern Woman]]\" from the film ''[[Ruthless People]]'', a dark comedy from the directors of ''[[Airplane!]]'' (both No. 10). In a departure from his \"piano man\" persona, Joel is shown in the video playing a [[Gibson Les Paul]]. The ballad \"[[This Is the Time (song)|This is the Time]]\" also charted, peaking at No. 18.\n\nOn November 18, 1986, an extended version of the song \"[[Big Man on Mulberry Street]]\" was used on a Season 3 episode of ''[[Moonlighting (TV series)|Moonlighting]]''. The episode itself was also titled \"Big Man on Mulberry Street\".\n\n''The Bridge'' was Joel's last album to carry the Family Productions logo, after which he severed his ties with Artie Ripp. Joel has also stated in many interviews, most recently in a 2008 interview in ''Performing Songwriter'' magazine, that he does not think ''The Bridge'' is a good album.\n\nIn October 1986, Joel and his team started planning a trip to the Soviet Union.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/24/arts/extra/24artsextra-joel.html |title=At Garden, Billy Joel Is Out to Prove He's in Control |first=Laura|last=Sinagra |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=April 18, 2014 |date=January 24, 2006}}</ref> There were live performances at indoor arenas in Moscow, [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]] and [[Tbilisi]]. Joel, his family (including young daughter Alexa), and his full touring band made the trip in August 1987.

Singer Pete Hewlett was brought in to hit the high notes on his most vocally challenging songs, like \"An Innocent Man\". Joel also did versions of The Beatles' classic \"[[Back in the U.S.S.R.]]\" and [[Bob Dylan]]'s \"[[The Times They Are a-Changin' (song)|The Times They Are a-Changin]]\". It has been estimated that Joel lost more than US$1&nbsp;million of his own money on the trip and concerts, but he has said the goodwill he was shown there was well worth it.<ref name=\"unauthorized\" />\n\n===1988\u20131993: ''Storm Front'' and ''River of Dreams'' ===\nThe Disney animated children's film, ''[[Oliver & Company]]'', released in November 1988, features Joel in a rare acting (voice only) role, as the character Dodger.  The character's design is based on Joel's image at the time, including his trademark Wayfarer sunglasses. Joel also sang his character's song \"Why Should I Worry?\".\n\nThe recording of the album ''[[Storm Front (album)|Storm Front]]'', which commenced in 1988, coincided with major changes in Joel's career and inaugurated a period of serious upheaval in his business affairs. In August 1989, just before the album was released, Joel dismissed his manager (and former brother-in-law) Frank Weber after an audit revealed major discrepancies in Weber's accounting. Joel subsequently sued Weber for US$90&nbsp;million, claiming fraud and breach of fiduciary duty and in January 1990 he was awarded US$2&nbsp;million in a partial judgment against Weber; in April, the court dismissed a US$30&nbsp;million countersuit filed by Weber.<ref>{{cite web |author=Pore-Lee-Dunn Productions |url=http://www.classicbands.com/joel.html |title=Billy Joel |publisher=Classicbands.com |date=February 4, 2007 |accessdate=August 19, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe first single for the album, \"[[We Didn't Start the Fire]]\", was released in September 1989 and it became Joel's third and \u2013 to date \u2013 most-recent US number-one hit, spending two weeks at the top. ''Storm Front'' was released in October, and it eventually became Joel's first number-one album since ''Glass Houses'', nine years earlier. ''Storm Front'' was Joel's first album since ''Turnstiles'' to be recorded without Phil Ramone as producer. For this album, he wanted a new sound, and worked with [[Mick Jones (Foreigner)|Mick Jones]] of [[Foreigner (band)|Foreigner]] fame. Joel is also credited as one of the keyboard players on Jones' 1988 self-titled solo album, and is featured in the official video for Jones' single \"Just Wanna Hold\"; Joel can be seen playing the piano while his then-wife Christie Brinkley joins him and kisses him. Joel also revamped his backing band, dismissing everyone but drummer [[Liberty DeVitto]], guitarist David Brown, and saxophone player [[Mark Rivera]], and bringing in new faces, including multi-instrumentalist [[Crystal Taliefero]].\n\n''Storm Front'''s second single, \"[[I Go to Extremes]]\" reached No. 6 in early 1990. The album was also notable for its song \"[[Leningrad (song)|Leningrad]]\", written after Joel met a clown in the Soviet city of that name during his tour in 1987, and \"[[The Downeaster Alexa]]\", written to underscore the plight of fishermen on Long Island who are barely able to make ends meet. Another well-known single from the album is the ballad \"[[And So It Goes]]\" (No. 37 in late 1990). The song was originally written in 1983, around the time Joel was writing songs for ''An Innocent Man''; but \"And So It Goes\" did not fit that album's retro theme, so it was held back until ''Storm Front''. Joel said in a 1996 Masterclass session in Pittsburgh that ''Storm Front'' was a turbulent album and that \"And So It Goes\", as the last song on the album, portrayed the calm and tranquility that often follows a violent thunderstorm.\n\nIn the summer of 1992, Joel filed another US$90&nbsp;million lawsuit against his former lawyer Allen Grubman, alleging a wide range of offenses including fraud, breach of fiduciary responsibility, malpractice and breach of contract<ref>{{cite news |first=Geraldine |last=Fabrikant |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/09/24/business/billy-joel-takes-his-lawyers-to-court.html |title=Billy Joel takes his lawyers to court |work=The New York Times |date=September 24, 1992 |accessdate=August 19, 2011}}</ref> but the case was eventually settled out of court for an undisclosed sum.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cityfile.com/profiles/billy-joel |title=Profiles&nbsp;\u2013 Billy Joel |publisher=CityFile.com |date= |accessdate=August 19, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724010023/http://cityfile.com/profiles/billy-joel |archivedate=July 24, 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 1992, Joel inducted the R&B duo [[Sam & Dave]] into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. That year, Joel also started work on ''[[River of Dreams]]'', finishing the album in early 1993. Its cover art was a colorful painting by [[Christie Brinkley]] that was a series of scenes from each of the songs on the album. The [[The River of Dreams|eponymous first single]] was the last top 10 hit Joel has penned to date, reaching No. 3 on ''Billboard'''s Hot 100 chart and ranking at No. 21 on the 1993 year-end Hot 100 chart. In addition to the title track, the album includes the hits \"[[All About Soul]]\" (with [[Color Me Badd]] on backing vocals) and \"[[Lullabye (Goodnight, My Angel)]]\", written for his daughter, [[Alexa Ray Joel|Alexa]]. A radio remix version of \"All About Soul\" can be found on ''[[The Essential Billy Joel]]'' (2001), and a demo version appears on ''My Lives'' (2005).\n\nThe song \"The Great Wall of China\" was written about his ex-manager Frank Weber and was a regular in the setlist for Joel's 2006 tour. \"2000 Years\" was prominent in the millennium concert at [[Madison Square Garden]], December 31, 1999, and \"Famous Last Words\" closed the book on Joel's pop songwriting for more than a decade.\n\n===1994\u2013present: Touring===\n[[File:BILLY7.jpg|thumb|Joel at Madison Square Garden, circa 1995.]]\n[[File:PSX 20190119 094326.jpg|alt=Joel performing at Madison Square Garden, circa 2006.|thumb|Joel performing at Madison Square Garden, circa 2006.]]\nBeginning in 1994, Joel toured extensively with [[Elton John]] on a series of \"Face to Face\" tours, making them the longest running and most successful concert tandem in pop music history.<ref>[http://tampabay.metromix.com/music/concert/billy-joel-and-elton-downtown-area/808679/content Concerts: Billy Joel & Elton John] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090115042336/http://tampabay.metromix.com/music/concert/billy-joel-and-elton-downtown-area/808679/content |date=January 15, 2009 }}. tampabay.metromix.com.

Joel wrote and recorded the song \"Shameless\" that was later covered by [[Garth Brooks]] and reached No. 1 on ''Billboard'''s country charts. Joel performed with Brooks during his [[Central Park]] concert in 1997. To add onto his achievements Joel was inducted into the Rock 'n Roll Hall of Fame in 1999. Ray Charles made the induction speech and mentioned the duet Joel wrote for the two of them, \"[[Baby Grand]]\" (a track on Joel's album ''[[The Bridge (Billy Joel album)|The Bridge]]'' released in 1986).\n\nOn December 31, 1999, Joel performed at New York's [[Madison Square Garden]]. At the time, Joel said that it would be his last tour and possibly his last concert. Two of his performances from that night, \"[[We Didn't Start the Fire]]\" and \"[[Scenes from an Italian Restaurant]]\" were filmed and featured that night as part of ABC's special New Year's Y2K coverage. The concert (dubbed The Night of the 2000 Years) ran for close to four hours and was later released as ''[[2000 Years: The Millennium Concert]]''.\n\nIn 2001, Joel released ''[[Fantasies & Delusions]]'', a collection of classical piano pieces. All were composed by Joel and performed by [[Hyung-ki Joo]]. Joel often uses bits of these songs as interludes in live performances, and some of them are part of the score for the hit show ''[[Movin' Out (musical)|Movin' Out]]''. The album topped the classical charts at No. 1. Joel performed \"New York State of Mind\" live on September 21, 2001, as part of the [[America: A Tribute to Heroes]] benefit concert, and on October 20, 2001, along with \"[[Miami 2017 (Seen the Lights Go Out on Broadway)]]\", at [[the Concert for New York City]] in Madison Square Garden. That night, he also performed \"[[Your Song]]\" with [[Elton John]].\n\nIn 2003, Joel inducted [[The Righteous Brothers]] into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, noting that his song \"[[Until the Night]]\" from the album ''52nd Street'' was a tribute to the duo.\n\nIn 2005, Columbia released a box set, ''[[My Lives]]'', which is largely a compilation of demos, b-sides, live/alternative versions and even a few Top 40 hits. The compilation also includes the [[Umixit]] software, in which people can remix \"Zanzibar\" and a live version of \"I Go to Extremes\" with their PC. Also, a DVD of a show from the ''River of Dreams'' tour is included.\n\n[[File:Mike DelGuidice 13.jpg|left|thumb|Billy Joel with his band performing in California]]\nOn January 7, 2006, Joel began a tour across the U.S. Having not written, or at least released, any new songs in 13 years, he featured a sampling of songs from throughout his career, including major hits as well as obscure tunes like \"Zanzibar\" and \"[[All for Leyna]]\". His tour included an unprecedented 12 sold-out concerts over several months at [[Madison Square Garden]] in New York City. The singer's stint of 12 shows at Madison Square Garden broke a previous record set by New Jersey native [[Bruce Springsteen]], who played 10 sold-out shows at the same arena. The record earned Joel the first retired number (12) in the arena owned by a non-athlete. This honor has also been given to Joel at the [[Wells Fargo Center (Philadelphia)]] (formerly the Wachovia Center) in Philadelphia where a banner in the colors of the [[Philadelphia Flyers]] is hung honoring Joel's 46 Philadelphia sold-out shows. He also had a banner raised in his honor for being the highest grossing act in the history of the [[Times Union Center]] (formerly the Knickerbocker Arena and Pepsi Arena) in [[Albany, New York]]. This honor was given to him as part of the April 17, 2007, show he did there. On June 13, 2006, Columbia released ''[[12 Gardens Live]]'', a double album containing 32 live recordings from a collection of the 12 different shows at Madison Square Garden during Joel's 2006 tour.\n\nJoel visited the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Ireland]] for the first time in many years as part of the European leg of his 2006 tour.

Joel performed his classical piece titled, \"Waltz No. 2 (Steinway Hall)\" from Fantasies and Delusions arranged by [[Brad Ellis]]. He also played many of his less well-known pieces, with full orchestral backing arranged by Mr. Ellis, including the rarely performed ''Nylon Curtain'' songs \"Scandinavian Skies\" and \"Where's the Orchestra?\".\n\nOn March 10, 2008, Joel inducted his friend [[John Mellencamp]] into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in a ceremony at the [[Waldorf Astoria Hotel]] in New York City.\n\nJoel's staying power as a touring act continues to the present day.

The concerts were featured in the 2010 documentary film ''[[Last Play at Shea]]''. The film was released on DVD on February 8, 2011. The CD and DVD of the show, ''[[Live at Shea Stadium: The Concert|Live at Shea Stadium]]'', were released on March 8, 2011.\n\nOn December 11, 2008, Joel recorded his own rendition of \"[[Christmas in Fallujah]]\" during a concert at [[Acer Arena]] in Sydney and released it as a live single in Australia only.

Growing up, he took piano lessons at the insistence of his mother. After dropping out of [[high school]] to pursue a musical career, Joel took part in two short-lived bands, [[The Hassles]] and [[Attila (rock band)|Attila]], before signing a record deal with Family Productions and kicking off a solo career in 1971 with his first release, ''[[Cold Spring Harbor (album)|Cold Spring Harbor]]''. In 1972, Joel caught the attention of [[Columbia Records]] after a live radio performance of the song \"[[Captain Jack (Billy Joel song)|Captain Jack]]\" became popular in Philadelphia, prompting him to sign a new record deal with the company and release his second album, ''[[Piano Man (Billy Joel album)|Piano Man]]'', in 1973. After releasing the albums ''[[Streetlife Serenade]]'' and ''[[Turnstiles (album)|Turnstiles]]'' in 1974 and 1976 respectively, Joel released his critical and commercial breakthrough album, ''[[The Stranger (album)|The Stranger]]'', in 1977. This album became Columbia's best-selling release, selling over 10 million copies and spawning several hit singles, including \"[[Just the Way You Are (Billy Joel song)|Just the Way You Are]]\", \"[[Movin' Out (Anthony's Song)]]\", \"[[Only the Good Die Young]]\", and \"[[She's Always a Woman]]\"; another song on this album, \"[[Scenes from an Italian Restaurant]]\", is Joel's favorite of his own songs and has become a staple of his live shows.<ref>{{Cite web |url= https://www.newsday.com/entertainment/music/billy-joel/billy-joel-talks-scenes-from-an-italian-restaurant-i-couldn-t-do-a-show-without-it-1.10695315|title=Joel on 'Scenes': I couldn't do a show without it| website= Newsday| language= en| access-date= 2019-06-06}}</ref>\n\nJoel's next album, ''[[52nd Street (album)|52nd Street]]'', was released in 1978 and became his first album to peak at No.1 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart. Joel released his seventh studio album, ''[[Glass Houses (album)|Glass Houses]]'', in 1980 in an attempt to further establish himself as a rock and roll artist; this release featured \"[[It's Still Rock and Roll to Me]]\" (Joel's first single to top the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart), \"[[You May Be Right (song)|You May Be Right]]\", \"[[Don't Ask Me Why (Billy Joel song)|Don't Ask Me Why]]\", and \"[[Sometimes a Fantasy]]\". His next album, ''[[The Nylon Curtain]]'', was released in 1982, and stemmed from a desire from Joel to create more lyrically and melodically ambitious music. ''[[An Innocent Man]]'', released in 1983, served as an homage to genres of music which Joel had grown up with in the 1950s, such as [[rhythm and blues]] and [[doo-wop]]; this release featured \"[[Uptown Girl]]\" and \"[[The Longest Time]]\", two of his best-known songs today. After releasing the albums ''[[The Bridge (Billy Joel album)|The Bridge]]'' and ''[[Storm Front (album)|Storm Front]]'' in 1986 and 1989 respectively, Joel released his twelfth and to date final studio album, ''[[River of Dreams]]'', in 1993. He went on to release ''[[Fantasies and Delusions]]'', a 2001 album featuring [[classical music|classical]] compositions composed by Joel and performed by British-Korean pianist [[Richard Hyung-ki Joo]]. Joel also provided voiceover work in 1988 for the [[animated film|animated]] [[Walt Disney Feature Animation|Disney]] film, ''[[Oliver & Company]]'', in which he played the character Dodger, and contributed to the soundtracks to several different films, including ''[[Easy Money (1983 film)|Easy Money]]'', ''[[Ruthless People]]'', and ''[[Honeymoon in Vegas]]''.\n\nAcross the 20 years of his solo career, Joel produced 33 Top 40 hits in the U.S., all of which he wrote himself,<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/10/27/thirty-three-hit-wonder |title=Thirty-Three-Hit Wonder |website=newyorker.com |accessdate= July 19, 2018}}</ref> and three of which (\"It's Still Rock and Roll to Me\", \"[[Tell Her About It]]\", and \"[[We Didn't Start the Fire]]\") managed to peak at the top of the [[Billboard Hot 100]] charts. Joel has been nominated for 23 [[Grammy Award]]s, winning five of them, including Album of the Year for ''52nd Street''. Joel was inducted into the [[Songwriters Hall of Fame]] (1992), the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] (1999),<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.rockhall.com/inductees/billy-joel |title=Billy Joel |website=Rock & Roll Hall of Fame| language= en |access-date= January 19, 2017}}</ref> and the [[Long Island Music Hall of Fame]] (2006).

Since the advent of his solo career, Joel has held a successful touring career, holding live performances across the globe in which he sings several of his written songs. In 1987, he became one of the very first artists to hold a rock and roll tour in the [[Soviet Union]] following the country's alleviation of the ban on rock and roll music. Despite largely retiring from writing and releasing pop music following the release of ''River of Dreams'', he continues to tour; he frequently performs at [[Madison Square Garden]] in [[Manhattan]]. Joel has been in several relationships, including marriages to Elizabeth Weber Small, model [[Christie Brinkley]], and chef [[Katie Lee (chef)|Katie Lee]]; since 2015, he has been married to Alexis Roderick, his fourth spouse.

Guitarist Al Hertzberg was replaced by Don Evans, and bassist Larry Russell by Patrick McDonald, himself replaced in late 1974 by [[Doug Stegmeyer]], who stayed with Joel until 1989. Rhys Clark returned as drummer and Tom Whitehorse as banjoist and pedal steel player; Johnny Almond joined as saxophonist and keyboardist.

Produced by [[James William Guercio]] (then [[Chicago (band)|Chicago]]'s producer), ''Turnstiles'' was first recorded at [[Caribou Ranch]] with members of [[Elton John]]'s band. Dissatisfied with the result, Joel re-recorded the songs and produced the album himself.\n\n\"[[Say Goodbye to Hollywood]]\" was a minor hit; [[Ronnie Spector]] recorded a cover as did [[Nigel Olsson]], then drummer with Elton John. In a 2008 radio interview, Joel said that he no longer performs the song because singing it in its high original key \"shreds\" his [[vocal cords]]; however, he did finally play it live for the first time since 1982 when he sang it at the [[Hollywood Bowl]] in May 2014. Although never released as a single, \"[[New York State of Mind]]\" became one of Joel's best-known songs; [[Barbra Streisand]] recorded a cover and [[Tony Bennett]] performed it as a duet with Joel on ''[[Playing with My Friends: Bennett Sings the Blues]]''. Other notable songs from the album include \"[[Summer, Highland Falls]]\"; \"[[Miami 2017 (Seen the Lights Go Out on Broadway)]]\"; \"Say Goodbye to Hollywood\" (a live version of which became a Top 40 hit); and \"[[Prelude/Angry Young Man]],\" a concert mainstay.\n\n===1977\u20131979: ''The Stranger'' and ''52nd Street'' ===\nColumbia Records introduced Joel to [[Phil Ramone]], who produced all of Joel's studio albums from ''[[The Stranger (album)|The Stranger]] ''(1977) to ''[[The Bridge (Billy Joel album)|The Bridge]]'' (1986).

Joel thought these labels were unfair and insulting, and with ''[[Glass Houses (album)|Glass Houses]]'', he tried to record an album that proved that he could rock harder than his critics gave him credit for, occasionally imitating and referring to the style of [[New wave music|new wave]] rock music that was starting to become popular at the time. On the front cover of the album, Joel is pictured in a leather jacket, about to throw a rock at a glass house (referring to the adage that \"people who live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones\").\n\n''Glass Houses'' spent six weeks at No. 1 on the ''Billboard'' chart and yielded such hits as \"[[You May Be Right (song)|You May Be Right]]\" (used as the theme song, covered by [[Southside Johnny]], for the CBS mid-1990s sitcom ''[[Dave's World]]'') (No. 7, May 1980), \"[[Don't Ask Me Why (Billy Joel song)|Don't Ask Me Why]]\" (No. 19, September 1980), \"[[Sometimes a Fantasy]]\" (No. 36, November 1980) and \"[[It's Still Rock and Roll to Me]]\", which became Joel's first ''Billboard'' number-one single (for two weeks) in July 1980. \"It's Still Rock and Roll to Me\" spent 11 weeks in the top 10 of the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and was the 7th biggest hit of 1980 according to American Top 40.

It also won the [[American Music Award]] for Favorite Album, Pop/Rock category. The album's closing song, \"Through The Long Night\" ([[B-side]] of the \"It's Still Rock & Roll to Me\" single), was a lullaby that featured Joel harmonizing with himself in a song he says was inspired by [[The Beatles]]' \"[[Yes It Is]]\".<ref name=\"unauthorized\" /> In a recorded Masterclass at the University of Pennsylvania, Joel later recollected that he had written to the Beatles asking them how to get started in the music industry.

It was recorded during larger US arenas and intimate night club shows in June and July 1980. This release introduced many fans, who discovered Joel when ''The Stranger'' became a smash in 1977, to many of his earlier compositions. The album reached No. 8 on the ''Billboard'' chart and produced two hit singles: \"Say Goodbye to Hollywood\" (No. 17), and \"She's Got a Way\" (No. 23). It sold over 3&nbsp;million copies. Although not as successful as some of his previous albums, the album was still considered a success by Joel.<ref name=\"unauthorized\" />\n\nThe next wave of Joel's career commenced with the recording of his next studio album, ''[[The Nylon Curtain]]''. With ''The Nylon Curtain'', Joel became more ambitious with his songwriting, trying his hand at writing topical songs like \"Allentown\" and \"Goodnight Saigon\". Joel has stated that he wanted the album to communicate his feelings about [[the American Dream]] and how changes in American politics during the [[Ronald Reagan#First term.2C 1981.E2.80.9385|Reagan years]] meant that \"all of a sudden you weren't going to be able to inherit [the kind of life] your old man had.\"<ref name=\"ncvideo\">{{cite video |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pqc4U8uWTRU |title=Billy Joel on The Nylon Curtain&nbsp;\u2013 from The Complete Albums Collection |publisher=YouTube}}</ref> He also tried to be more ambitious in his use of the recording studio. Joel said that he wanted to \"create a sonic masterpiece\" on ''The Nylon Curtain''. So he spent more time in the studio, crafting the sound of the album, than he had on any previous album.<ref name=\"ncvideo\" /> Production of ''The Nylon Curtain'' began in the fall of 1981. However, production was temporarily delayed when Joel was involved in a serious motorcycle accident on [[Long Island]] on April 15, 1982, severely injuring his hands. Still, Joel quickly recovered from his injuries, and the album only ended up being delayed by a few months.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ultimateclassicrock.com/billy-joel-motorcycle-accident/|title=35 Years Ago: Billy Joel Injures Both Hands in Motorcycle Accident|website=Ultimate Classic Rock|accessdate=July 14, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 1982, he embarked on a brief tour in support of the album. From one of the final shows of the tour, Joel made his first video special, ''Live from Long Island'', which was recorded at the [[Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum]] in [[Uniondale, New York]] on December 30, 1982. It was originally broadcast on [[HBO]] in 1983 before it became available on VHS.\n\n''The Nylon Curtain'' went to No. 7 on the charts, partially due to heavy airplay on MTV for the videos to the singles \"[[Allentown (song)|Allentown]]\" and \"[[Pressure (Billy Joel song)|Pressure]]\". \"Allentown\" spent six weeks at a peak position of No. 17 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100, making it one of the most-played radio songs of 1982, pushing it into 1983's year-end Top 70, and making it the most successful song from ''The Nylon Curtain'' album, besting \"Pressure\" which peaked at No. 20 (where it resided for three weeks) and \"[[Goodnight Saigon]]\" which reached No. 56 on U.S. charts.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=7694 |title=Goodnight Saigon by Billy Joel|work= Songfacts |publisher=songfacts.com |accessdate=November 8, 2010}}</ref>\n\n===1983\u20131988: ''An Innocent Man'' and ''The Bridge'' ===\n{{more citations needed|section|date=April 2019}}\nJoel's next album moved away from the serious themes of ''The Nylon Curtain'' and struck a much lighter tone. The album ''[[An Innocent Man]]'' was Joel's tribute to [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] and [[doo wop]] music of the 1950s and 1960s and resulted in Joel's second ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' number-one hit, \"[[Tell Her About It]]\", which was the first single off the album in the summer of 1983. The album itself reached No. 4 on the charts and No. 2 in UK. It also boasted six top-30 singles, the most of any album in Joel's catalog. The album was well received by critics, with [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]], senior editor for AllMusic, describing Joel as being \"in top form as a craftsman throughout the record, effortlessly spinning out infectious, memorable melodies in a variety of styles.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Thomas |first=Stephen |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/an-innocent-man-mw0000190510 |title=An Innocent Man&nbsp;\u2013 Billy Joel : Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards |website=AllMusic |accessdate=September 12, 2012}}</ref>\n\nAt the time that the album was released, [[WCBS-FM]] began playing \"[[Uptown Girl]]\" both in regular rotation and on the ''Doo Wop Live''.<ref>YouTube (uploaded April 6, 2008).</ref><ref>Billy Joel's Interview on Howard Stern. 2011.{{which|date=October 2012}}</ref> The song became a worldwide hit upon its release. The music video of the song, originally written about then girlfriend [[Elle MacPherson]], featured future wife [[Christie Brinkley]] as a high society girl, whose car pulls into the gas station where Joel's character is working. At the end of the video, Joel's \"grease monkey\" character drives off with his \"uptown girl\" on the back of a motorcycle. When Brinkley went to visit Joel after being asked to star in the video, the first thing Joel said to her upon opening his door was \"I don't dance\". Brinkley had to walk him through the basic steps he does in the video. Their work together on this video shoot sparked a relationship between the two which led to their marriage in 1985.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bsC_CAAAQBAJ&pg=PT214|title=The Girl in the Song: The Real Stories Behind 50 Rock Classics|first1=Michael|last1=Heatley|first2=Frank|last2=Hopkinson|date=November 24, 2014|publisher=Pavilion Books|accessdate=January 28, 2017|via=Google Books}}</ref>\n\nIn December, the title song, \"[[An Innocent Man (song)|An Innocent Man]]\", was released as a single and it peaked at No. 10 in the U.S. and No. 8 in the UK, early in 1984. That March, \"[[The Longest Time]]\" was released as a single, peaking at No. 14 on the Hot 100 and No. 1 on the Adult Contemporary chart. That summer, \"[[Leave a Tender Moment Alone]]\" was released and it hit No. 27 while \"[[Keeping the Faith (song)|Keeping the Faith]]\" peaked at No. 18 in January 1985. In the video for \"Keeping the Faith\", Christie Brinkley also plays the \"redhead girl in a Chevrolet\". ''An Innocent Man'' was also nominated for the Album of the Year Grammy, but lost to [[Michael Jackson]]'s ''[[Thriller (Michael Jackson album)|Thriller]]''.\n\nJoel participated in the [[USA for Africa]] \"[[We Are the World]]\" project in 1985.\n\nFollowing the success of ''An Innocent Man'', Joel was asked about releasing an album of his most successful singles. This was not the first time this topic had come up, but Joel had initially considered \"Greatest Hits\" albums as marking the end of one's career. This time he agreed, and ''[[Greatest Hits (Billy Joel albums)|Greatest Hits Vol. 1 and 2]]'' was released as a four-sided album and two-CD set, with the songs in the order in which they were released. The new songs \"[[You're Only Human (Second Wind)]]\" and \"[[The Night Is Still Young (Billy Joel song)|The Night Is Still Young]]\" were recorded and released as singles to support the album; both reached the top 40, peaking at No. 9 and No. 34, respectively. ''Greatest Hits'' was highly successful and it has since been certified [[Diamond album|double diamond]] by the [[RIAA]], with over 11.5&nbsp;million copies (23&nbsp;million units) sold. It is one of the [[List of best-selling albums in the United States|best-selling albums in American music history]], according to the RIAA.\n\nCoinciding with the ''Greatest Hits'' album release, Joel released a two-volume ''Video Album'' that was a compilation of the promotional videos he had recorded from 1977 to the present time. Along with videos for the new singles off the ''Greatest Hits'' album, Joel also recorded a video for his first hit, \"Piano Man\", for this project.\n\nJoel's next album, ''[[The Bridge (Billy Joel album)|The Bridge]]'' (1986), did not achieve the level of success of his previous albums, but it yielded the hits \"[[A Matter of Trust]]\" and \"[[Modern Woman]]\" from the film ''[[Ruthless People]]'', a dark comedy from the directors of ''[[Airplane!]]'' (both No. 10). In a departure from his \"piano man\" persona, Joel is shown in the video playing a [[Gibson Les Paul]]. The ballad \"[[This Is the Time (song)|This is the Time]]\" also charted, peaking at No. 18.\n\nOn November 18, 1986, an extended version of the song \"[[Big Man on Mulberry Street]]\" was used on a Season 3 episode of ''[[Moonlighting (TV series)|Moonlighting]]''. The episode itself was also titled \"Big Man on Mulberry Street\".\n\n''The Bridge'' was Joel's last album to carry the Family Productions logo, after which he severed his ties with Artie Ripp. Joel has also stated in many interviews, most recently in a 2008 interview in ''Performing Songwriter'' magazine, that he does not think ''The Bridge'' is a good album.\n\nIn October 1986, Joel and his team started planning a trip to the Soviet Union.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/24/arts/extra/24artsextra-joel.html |title=At Garden, Billy Joel Is Out to Prove He's in Control |first=Laura|last=Sinagra |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=April 18, 2014 |date=January 24, 2006}}</ref> There were live performances at indoor arenas in Moscow, [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]] and [[Tbilisi]]. Joel, his family (including young daughter Alexa), and his full touring band made the trip in August 1987.

Singer Pete Hewlett was brought in to hit the high notes on his most vocally challenging songs, like \"An Innocent Man\". Joel also did versions of The Beatles' classic \"[[Back in the U.S.S.R.]]\" and [[Bob Dylan]]'s \"[[The Times They Are a-Changin' (song)|The Times They Are a-Changin]]\". It has been estimated that Joel lost more than US$1&nbsp;million of his own money on the trip and concerts, but he has said the goodwill he was shown there was well worth it.<ref name=\"unauthorized\" />\n\n===1988\u20131993: ''Storm Front'' and ''River of Dreams'' ===\nThe Disney animated children's film, ''[[Oliver & Company]]'', released in November 1988, features Joel in a rare acting (voice only) role, as the character Dodger.  The character's design is based on Joel's image at the time, including his trademark Wayfarer sunglasses. Joel also sang his character's song \"Why Should I Worry?\".\n\nThe recording of the album ''[[Storm Front (album)|Storm Front]]'', which commenced in 1988, coincided with major changes in Joel's career and inaugurated a period of serious upheaval in his business affairs. In August 1989, just before the album was released, Joel dismissed his manager (and former brother-in-law) Frank Weber after an audit revealed major discrepancies in Weber's accounting. Joel subsequently sued Weber for US$90&nbsp;million, claiming fraud and breach of fiduciary duty and in January 1990 he was awarded US$2&nbsp;million in a partial judgment against Weber; in April, the court dismissed a US$30&nbsp;million countersuit filed by Weber.<ref>{{cite web |author=Pore-Lee-Dunn Productions |url=http://www.classicbands.com/joel.html |title=Billy Joel |publisher=Classicbands.com |date=February 4, 2007 |accessdate=August 19, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe first single for the album, \"[[We Didn't Start the Fire]]\", was released in September 1989 and it became Joel's third and \u2013 to date \u2013 most-recent US number-one hit, spending two weeks at the top. ''Storm Front'' was released in October, and it eventually became Joel's first number-one album since ''Glass Houses'', nine years earlier. ''Storm Front'' was Joel's first album since ''Turnstiles'' to be recorded without Phil Ramone as producer. For this album, he wanted a new sound, and worked with [[Mick Jones (Foreigner)|Mick Jones]] of [[Foreigner (band)|Foreigner]] fame. Joel is also credited as one of the keyboard players on Jones' 1988 self-titled solo album, and is featured in the official video for Jones' single \"Just Wanna Hold\"; Joel can be seen playing the piano while his then-wife Christie Brinkley joins him and kisses him. Joel also revamped his backing band, dismissing everyone but drummer [[Liberty DeVitto]], guitarist David Brown, and saxophone player [[Mark Rivera]], and bringing in new faces, including multi-instrumentalist [[Crystal Taliefero]].\n\n''Storm Front'''s second single, \"[[I Go to Extremes]]\" reached No. 6 in early 1990. The album was also notable for its song \"[[Leningrad (song)|Leningrad]]\", written after Joel met a clown in the Soviet city of that name during his tour in 1987, and \"[[The Downeaster Alexa]]\", written to underscore the plight of fishermen on Long Island who are barely able to make ends meet. Another well-known single from the album is the ballad \"[[And So It Goes]]\" (No. 37 in late 1990). The song was originally written in 1983, around the time Joel was writing songs for ''An Innocent Man''; but \"And So It Goes\" did not fit that album's retro theme, so it was held back until ''Storm Front''. Joel said in a 1996 Masterclass session in Pittsburgh that ''Storm Front'' was a turbulent album and that \"And So It Goes\", as the last song on the album, portrayed the calm and tranquility that often follows a violent thunderstorm.\n\nIn the summer of 1992, Joel filed another US$90&nbsp;million lawsuit against his former lawyer Allen Grubman, alleging a wide range of offenses including fraud, breach of fiduciary responsibility, malpractice and breach of contract<ref>{{cite news |first=Geraldine |last=Fabrikant |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/09/24/business/billy-joel-takes-his-lawyers-to-court.html |title=Billy Joel takes his lawyers to court |work=The New York Times |date=September 24, 1992 |accessdate=August 19, 2011}}</ref> but the case was eventually settled out of court for an undisclosed sum.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cityfile.com/profiles/billy-joel |title=Profiles&nbsp;\u2013 Billy Joel |publisher=CityFile.com |date= |accessdate=August 19, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724010023/http://cityfile.com/profiles/billy-joel |archivedate=July 24, 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 1992, Joel inducted the R&B duo [[Sam & Dave]] into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. That year, Joel also started work on ''[[River of Dreams]]'', finishing the album in early 1993. Its cover art was a colorful painting by [[Christie Brinkley]] that was a series of scenes from each of the songs on the album. The [[The River of Dreams|eponymous first single]] was the last top 10 hit Joel has penned to date, reaching No. 3 on ''Billboard'''s Hot 100 chart and ranking at No. 21 on the 1993 year-end Hot 100 chart. In addition to the title track, the album includes the hits \"[[All About Soul]]\" (with [[Color Me Badd]] on backing vocals) and \"[[Lullabye (Goodnight, My Angel)]]\", written for his daughter, [[Alexa Ray Joel|Alexa]]. A radio remix version of \"All About Soul\" can be found on ''[[The Essential Billy Joel]]'' (2001), and a demo version appears on ''My Lives'' (2005).\n\nThe song \"The Great Wall of China\" was written about his ex-manager Frank Weber and was a regular in the setlist for Joel's 2006 tour. \"2000 Years\" was prominent in the millennium concert at [[Madison Square Garden]], December 31, 1999, and \"Famous Last Words\" closed the book on Joel's pop songwriting for more than a decade.\n\n===1994\u2013present: Touring===\n[[File:BILLY7.jpg|thumb|Joel at Madison Square Garden, circa 1995.]]\n[[File:PSX 20190119 094326.jpg|alt=Joel performing at Madison Square Garden, circa 2006.|thumb|Joel performing at Madison Square Garden, circa 2006.]]\nBeginning in 1994, Joel toured extensively with [[Elton John]] on a series of \"Face to Face\" tours, making them the longest running and most successful concert tandem in pop music history.<ref>[http://tampabay.metromix.com/music/concert/billy-joel-and-elton-downtown-area/808679/content Concerts: Billy Joel & Elton John] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090115042336/http://tampabay.metromix.com/music/concert/billy-joel-and-elton-downtown-area/808679/content |date=January 15, 2009 }}. tampabay.metromix.com.

Joel wrote and recorded the song \"Shameless\" that was later covered by [[Garth Brooks]] and reached No. 1 on ''Billboard'''s country charts. Joel performed with Brooks during his [[Central Park]] concert in 1997. To add onto his achievements Joel was inducted into the Rock 'n Roll Hall of Fame in 1999. Ray Charles made the induction speech and mentioned the duet Joel wrote for the two of them, \"[[Baby Grand]]\" (a track on Joel's album ''[[The Bridge (Billy Joel album)|The Bridge]]'' released in 1986).\n\nOn December 31, 1999, Joel performed at New York's [[Madison Square Garden]]. At the time, Joel said that it would be his last tour and possibly his last concert. Two of his performances from that night, \"[[We Didn't Start the Fire]]\" and \"[[Scenes from an Italian Restaurant]]\" were filmed and featured that night as part of ABC's special New Year's Y2K coverage. The concert (dubbed The Night of the 2000 Years) ran for close to four hours and was later released as ''[[2000 Years: The Millennium Concert]]''.\n\nIn 2001, Joel released ''[[Fantasies & Delusions]]'', a collection of classical piano pieces. All were composed by Joel and performed by [[Hyung-ki Joo]]. Joel often uses bits of these songs as interludes in live performances, and some of them are part of the score for the hit show ''[[Movin' Out (musical)|Movin' Out]]''. The album topped the classical charts at No. 1. Joel performed \"New York State of Mind\" live on September 21, 2001, as part of the [[America: A Tribute to Heroes]] benefit concert, and on October 20, 2001, along with \"[[Miami 2017 (Seen the Lights Go Out on Broadway)]]\", at [[the Concert for New York City]] in Madison Square Garden. That night, he also performed \"[[Your Song]]\" with [[Elton John]].\n\nIn 2003, Joel inducted [[The Righteous Brothers]] into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, noting that his song \"[[Until the Night]]\" from the album ''52nd Street'' was a tribute to the duo.\n\nIn 2005, Columbia released a box set, ''[[My Lives]]'', which is largely a compilation of demos, b-sides, live/alternative versions and even a few Top 40 hits. The compilation also includes the [[Umixit]] software, in which people can remix \"Zanzibar\" and a live version of \"I Go to Extremes\" with their PC. Also, a DVD of a show from the ''River of Dreams'' tour is included.\n\n[[File:Mike DelGuidice 13.jpg|left|thumb|Billy Joel with his band performing in California]]\nOn January 7, 2006, Joel began a tour across the U.S. Having not written, or at least released, any new songs in 13 years, he featured a sampling of songs from throughout his career, including major hits as well as obscure tunes like \"Zanzibar\" and \"[[All for Leyna]]\". His tour included an unprecedented 12 sold-out concerts over several months at [[Madison Square Garden]] in New York City. The singer's stint of 12 shows at Madison Square Garden broke a previous record set by New Jersey native [[Bruce Springsteen]], who played 10 sold-out shows at the same arena. The record earned Joel the first retired number (12) in the arena owned by a non-athlete. This honor has also been given to Joel at the [[Wells Fargo Center (Philadelphia)]] (formerly the Wachovia Center) in Philadelphia where a banner in the colors of the [[Philadelphia Flyers]] is hung honoring Joel's 46 Philadelphia sold-out shows. He also had a banner raised in his honor for being the highest grossing act in the history of the [[Times Union Center]] (formerly the Knickerbocker Arena and Pepsi Arena) in [[Albany, New York]]. This honor was given to him as part of the April 17, 2007, show he did there. On June 13, 2006, Columbia released ''[[12 Gardens Live]]'', a double album containing 32 live recordings from a collection of the 12 different shows at Madison Square Garden during Joel's 2006 tour.\n\nJoel visited the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Ireland]] for the first time in many years as part of the European leg of his 2006 tour.

A banner was raised in his honor marking this achievement.\n\nOn December 1, 2007, Joel premiered his new song \"[[Christmas in Fallujah]]\".<ref>{{cite press release| date= November 30, 2007| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080207165801/http://www.billyjoel.com/pressrelease_fallujah.html | archivedate=February 7, 2008 |title=Emerging Singer-Songwriter Cass Dillon Premiers New Billy Joel Song, 'Christmas in Fallujah', Exclusively on iTunes Beginning Tuesday, December 4| website= billyjoel.com| publisher= Billy Joel| url= http://www.billyjoel.com/pressrelease_fallujah.html | access-date= }}</ref> The song was performed by [[Cass Dillon]], a new Long Island based musician, as Joel felt it should be sung by someone in a soldier's age range (though he himself has played the song occasionally in concert.) The track was dedicated to servicemen based in Iraq. Joel wrote it in September 2007 after reading numerous letters sent to him from American soldiers in Iraq. \"Christmas in Fallujah\" is only the second pop/rock song released by Joel since 1993's ''River of Dreams''. Proceeds from the song benefited the Homes For Our Troops foundation.\n\n[[File:Mike DelGuidice 4.jpg|thumb|Joel with [[Mike DelGuidice]] in 2016]]\nOn January 26, 2008, Joel performed with the [[Philadelphia Orchestra]] celebrating the 151st anniversary of the [[Academy of Music (Philadelphia)|Academy of Music]]. Joel performed his classical piece titled, \"Waltz No. 2 (Steinway Hall)\" from Fantasies and Delusions arranged by [[Brad Ellis]]. He also played many of his less well-known pieces, with full orchestral backing arranged by Mr. Ellis, including the rarely performed ''Nylon Curtain'' songs \"Scandinavian Skies\" and \"Where's the Orchestra?\".\n\nOn March 10, 2008, Joel inducted his friend [[John Mellencamp]] into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in a ceremony at the [[Waldorf Astoria Hotel]] in New York City.\n\nJoel's staying power as a touring act continues to the present day. He sold out 10 concerts at the [[Mohegan Sun Casino]] in [[Uncasville, Connecticut]] from May to July 2008. The casino honored him with a banner displaying his name and the number 10 to hang in the arena. On June 19, 2008, he played a concert at the grand re-opening of [[Caesars Windsor]] (formerly Casino Windsor) in [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]], [[Ontario]], [[Canada]], to an invite-only crowd for Casino VIPs. His mood was light, and joke-filled, even introducing himself as \"Billy Joel's dad\" and stating \"you guys overpaid to see a fat bald guy\". He also admitted that Canadian folk-pop musician [[Gordon Lightfoot]] was the musical inspiration for \"She's Always A Woman\".<ref>{{cite news| work= [[The Windsor Star]]| title= Billy Joel (notes)| date= June 20, 2008}}{{failed verification| date= October 2012}}</ref>\n\nOn July 16, 2008, and July 18, 2008, Joel played the final concerts at [[Shea Stadium]] before its demolition.

The concerts were featured in the 2010 documentary film ''[[Last Play at Shea]]''. The film was released on DVD on February 8, 2011. The CD and DVD of the show, ''[[Live at Shea Stadium: The Concert|Live at Shea Stadium]]'', were released on March 8, 2011.\n\nOn December 11, 2008, Joel recorded his own rendition of \"[[Christmas in Fallujah]]\" during a concert at [[Acer Arena]] in Sydney and released it as a live single in Australia only. It is the only official release of Joel performing \"Christmas in Fallujah\", as Cass Dillon sang on the 2007 studio recording and the handful of times the song was played live in 2007.

The board uses the traditional U.S. layout; the cheapest properties are purple, not brown, and \"Interest on Credit Card Debt\" replaces \"Luxury Tax\". \n\nDespite the updated Luxury Tax space, and the Income Tax space no longer using the 10% option, this edition uses paper ''Monopoly'' money, and not an electronic banking unit like the ''Here and Now World Edition''. However, a similar edition of ''Monopoly'', the ''Electronic Banking'' edition, does feature an electronic banking unit and bank cards, as well as a different set of tokens. Both ''Here and Now'' and ''Electronic Banking'' feature an updated set of tokens from the Atlantic City edition.<ref name=\"here_and_now_about\" />\n\nIt is also notable that three states (California, Florida, and Texas) are represented by two cities each (Los Angeles and San Francisco, Miami and Orlando, and Dallas and Houston).

Unlike money, houses and hotels have a finite supply. If no more are available, no substitute is allowed. In most editions, houses are green and hotels red.\n\n===Money===\n{{Main|Monopoly money}}\n\nOlder U.S. standard editions of the game included a total of '''$15,140''' in the following denominations:\n* 20 $500 bills (orange)\n* 20 $100 bills (beige)\n* 30 $50 bills (blue)\n* 50 $20 bills (green)\n* 40 $10 bills (yellow)\n* 40 $5 bills (pink)\n* 40 $1 bills (white)\n\nNewer (September 2008 and later) U.S. editions provide a total of '''$20,580'''\u201330 of each denomination instead. The colors of some of the bills are also changed: $10s are now blue instead of yellow, $20s are a brighter green than before, and $50s are now purple instead of blue.\n\nEach player begins the game with his or her token on the Go square, and $1,500 (or 1,500 of a localized currency) in play money ($2,500 with the Speed Die). Before September 2008, the money was divided with greater numbers of 20 and 10-dollar bills. Since then, the U.S. version has taken on the British version's initial cash distributions.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! U.S. editions prior to 2008 !!

However, the amount of cash contained in the game is enough for eight players with a slight alteration of bill distribution.\n\n====International currencies====\nPre-Euro German editions of the game started with 30,000 \"Spielmark\" in eight denominations (abbreviated as \"M.\"), and later used seven denominations of the \"Deutsche Mark\" (\"DM.\"). In the classic Italian game, each player received L. 350,000 ($3500) in a two-player game, but L. 50,000 ($500) less for each player more than two. Only in a six-player game does a player receive the equivalent of $1,500. The classic Italian games were played with only four denominations of currency. Both Spanish editions (the Barcelona and Madrid editions) started the game with 150,000 in play money, with a breakdown identical to that of the American version.\n\n====Extra currency====\nAccording to the Parker Brothers rules, Monopoly money is theoretically unlimited; if the bank runs out of money it may issue as much as needed \"by merely writing on any ordinary paper\".<ref>{{cite book |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Monopoly (rules) |url= |publisher=Parker Brothers |page= |date=1973 |location=Salem, Massachusetts |isbn=}}</ref>\nHowever, Hasbro's published Monopoly rules make no mention of this.<ref>{{cite book |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |url=https://www.hasbro.com/common/documents/dad288661c4311ddbd0b0800200c9a66/97DF546B6BF64A70A2A759D3FA5BD804.pdf\n|title=Monopoly (rules)|publisher=Hasbro |date=2016 |location=Pawtucket, Rhode Island}}</ref> Additional paper money can be bought at certain locations, notably game and hobby stores, or downloaded from various websites and printed and cut by hand.

Instead of receiving paper money, each player receives a plastic bank card that is inserted into a calculator-like electronic device that keeps track of the player's balance.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://mashable.com/2016/02/17/monopoly-ultimate-banking-edition/#gpMUxMZkwuqw |title=Bye, bye, banker: New Monopoly game goes cashless with electronic payments |website=mashable.com |accessdate=September 2, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.digit.in/general/indias-cashless-drive-inspired-hasbro-to-make-monopoly-electronic-banking-36703.html |title=Digit General India's cashless drive inspired Hasbro to make Monopoly Electronic Banking India's cashless drive inspired Hasbro to make Monopoly Electronic Banking |website=digit.in |accessdate=September 2, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Tokens===\n====Classic====\n\nEach player is represented by a small metal or plastic [[Game piece (board game)|token]] that is moved around the edge of the board according to the roll of two six-sided dice.

A typical turn begins with the rolling of the dice and advancing a piece clockwise around the board the corresponding number of squares. If a player rolls doubles, they roll again after completing that portion of their turn. A player who rolls three consecutive sets of doubles on one turn has been \"caught speeding\" and is immediately sent to jail instead of moving the amount shown on the dice for the third roll.\n\nA player who lands on or passes the Go space collects $200 from the bank. Players who land on either Income Tax or Luxury Tax pay the indicated amount to the bank. In older editions of the game, two options were given for Income Tax: either pay a flat fee of $200 or 10% of total net worth (including the current values of all the properties and buildings owned). No calculation could be made before the choice, and no latitude was given for reversing an unwise calculation. In 2008, the calculation option was removed from the official rules, and simultaneously the Luxury Tax was increased to $100 from its original $75. No reward or penalty is given for landing on Free Parking.\n\nProperties can only be developed once a player owns all the properties in that color group. They then must be developed equally. A house must be built on each property of that color before a second can be built. Each property within a group must be within one house level of all the others within that group.\n\n====Chance/Community Chest====\n\nIf a player lands on a Chance or Community Chest space, they draw the top card from the respective deck and follow its instructions. This may include collecting or paying money to the bank or another player or moving to a different space on the board. Two types of cards that involve jail, \"Go to Jail\" and \"[[Get Out of Jail Free card|Get Out of Jail Free]]\", are explained below.\n\n====Jail====\nA player is sent to jail for doing any of the following:\n* Landing directly on \"Go to Jail\"\n* Throwing three consecutive doubles in one turn\n* Drawing a \"Go to Jail\" card from Chance or Community Chest\n\nWhen a player is sent to jail, they move directly to the Jail space and their turn ends (\"[[Do not pass Go. Do not collect $200.]]\"). If an ordinary dice roll (not one of the above events) ends with the player's token on the Jail corner, they are \"Just Visiting\" and can move ahead on their next turn without incurring any penalty.\n\nIf a player is in jail, they do not take a normal turn and must either pay a fine of $50 to be released, use a Chance or Community Chest Get Out of Jail Free card, or attempt to roll doubles on the dice. If a player fails to roll doubles, they lose their turn. Failing to roll doubles for three consecutive turns requires the player to either pay the $50 fine or use a Get Out of Jail Free card, after which they move ahead according to the total rolled. Players in jail may not buy properties directly from the bank since they are unable to move. They can engage all other transactions, such as mortgaging properties, selling/trading properties to other players, buying/selling houses and hotels, collecting rent, and bidding on property auctions. A player who rolls doubles to leave jail does not roll again; however, if the player pays the fine or uses a card to get out and then rolls doubles, they do take another turn.\n\n====Properties====\nIf the player lands on an unowned property, whether street, railroad, or utility, they can buy the property for its listed purchase price. If they decline this purchase, the property is auctioned off by the bank to the highest bidder, including the player who declined to buy.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/life/news/a47100/monopoly-auction-rule/ |title=We Just Discovered a Game-Changing Monopoly Rule |website=goodhousekeeping.com |access-date=September 2, 2018|date=November 29, 2017 }}</ref> If the property landed on is already owned and unmortgaged, they must pay the owner a given rent; the amount depends on whether the property is part of a set or its level of development.\n\nWhen a player owns all the properties in a color group and none of them are mortgaged, they may develop them during their turn or in between other player's turns. Development involves buying miniature houses or hotels from the bank and placing them on the property spaces; this must be done uniformly across the group. That is, a second house cannot be built on any property within a group until all of them have one house. Once the player owns an entire group, they can collect double rent for any undeveloped properties within it. Although houses and hotels cannot be built on railroads or utilities, the given rent increases if a player owns more than one of either type. If there is a housing shortage (more demand for houses to be built than what remains in the bank), then a housing auction is conducted to determine who will get to purchase each house.\n\n====Mortgaging====\nProperties can also be mortgaged, although all developments on a monopoly must be sold before any property of that color can be mortgaged or traded. The player receives half the purchase price from the bank for each mortgaged property. This must be repaid with 10% interest to clear the mortgage. Houses and hotels can be sold back to the bank for half their purchase price. Players cannot collect rent on mortgaged properties and may not give improved property away to others; however, trading mortgaged properties is allowed. The player receiving the mortgaged property must immediately pay the bank the mortgage price plus 10% or pay just the 10% amount and keep the property mortgaged; if the player chooses the latter, they must pay the 10% again when they pay off the mortgage.\n\n====Bankruptcy====\nA player who cannot pay what they owe is bankrupt and eliminated from the game. If the bankrupt player owes the bank, they must turn all their assets over to the bank, who then auctions off their properties (if they have any), except buildings. If the debt is owed to another player instead, all assets are given to that opponent, except buildings which must be returned to the bank. The new owner must either pay off any mortgages held by the bank on such properties received or pay a fee of 10% of the mortgaged value to the bank if they choose to leave the properties mortgaged. The winner is the remaining player left after all of the others have gone bankrupt.\n\nIf a player runs out of money but still has assets that can be converted to cash, they can do so by selling buildings, mortgaging properties, or trading with other players. To avoid bankruptcy the player must be able to raise enough cash to pay the full amount owed.\n\nA player cannot choose to go bankrupt; if there is any way to pay what they owe, even by returning all their buildings at a loss, mortgaging all their real estate and giving up all their cash, even knowing they are likely going bankrupt the next time, they must do so.\n\n===Official Short Game rules===\nFrom 1936, the rules booklet included with each Monopoly set contained a short section at the end providing rules for making the game shorter, including dealing out two Title Deed cards to each player before starting the game, by setting a time limit or by ending the game after the second player goes bankrupt. A later version of the rules included this variant, along with the time limit game, in the main rules booklet, omitting the last, the second bankruptcy method, as a third short game.<ref>{{Cite book | author=Brady, Maxine | title=The Monopoly Book | publisher=David McKay Company | year=1974 | isbn=0-679-20292-7 | pages=[https://archive.org/details/monopolybookstra00brad/page/143 143\u2013144] | url=https://archive.org/details/monopolybookstra00brad/page/143 | author-link=Maxine Brady }}</ref>\n\n===House rules===\n{{rquote|right|[V]irtually no one plays the game with the rules as written.|''Computer Gaming World'', 1994<ref name=\"cgw199408\">{{Cite magazine\n |last=\n |first=\n |author=\n |last2=\n |first2=\n |date=August 1994\n |title=These Just In\n |department=Now Playing\n |url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1994&pub=2&id=121\n |magazine=Computer Gaming World\n |pages=152\u2013156\n |type=\n}}</ref>}}\n\nMany [[house rules]] have emerged for the game throughout its history. Well-known is the \"Free Parking jackpot rule\", where all the money collected from Income Tax, Luxury Tax, Chance and Community Chest goes to the center of the board instead of the bank. Many people add $500 to start each pile of Free Parking money, guaranteeing a minimum payout. When a player lands on Free Parking, they may take the money. Another rule is that if a player lands directly on Go, they collect double the amount, or $400, instead of $200. Since these rules provide additional cash to players regardless of their property management choices, they can lengthen the game considerably and limit the role of strategy.<ref name=\"ditch\">{{cite web|last=Dove |first=Laurie L. |url=http://www.howstuffworks.com/leisure/brain-games/5-monopoly-house-rules-you-should-ditch.htm |title=5 Monopoly House Rules You Should Ditch |publisher=Howstuffworks.com |accessdate=July 11, 2013|date=February 7, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nVideo game and computer game versions of ''Monopoly'' have options where popular house rules can be used. In 2014, Hasbro determined five popular house rules by public Facebook vote, and released a \"House Rules Edition\" of the board game. Rules selected include a \"Free Parking\" house rule without additional money and forcing players to traverse the board once before buying properties.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/hasbro-unveils-worlds-favorite-house-rules-to-be-included-in-future-monopoly-games-2014-04-04|title=Hasbro Unveils World's Favorite \"House Rules\" to Be Included in Future Monopoly Games|work=MarketWatch}}</ref>\n\n==Strategy==\nAccording to Jim Slater in ''[[The Mayfair Set]]'', the Orange property group is the best to own because players land on them more often, as a result of the Chance cards \"Go to Jail\", \"Advance to St. Charles Place (Pall Mall)\", \"Advance to Reading Railroad (Kings Cross Station)\" and \"Go Back Three Spaces\".<ref>{{YouTube|id=PdQ3ztGk0D4|title=The Mayfair Set \u2013 Episode 4 (Adam Curtis, BBC}}</ref>\n\nIn all, during game play, Illinois Avenue (Trafalgar Square) (Red), New York Avenue (Vine Street) (Orange), B&O Railroad (Fenchurch Street Station), and Reading Railroad (Kings Cross Station) are the most frequently landed-upon properties.

Edward P. Parker, a former president of [[Parker Brothers]], is quoted as saying, \"We always felt that forty-five minutes was about the right length for a game, but ''Monopoly'' could go on for hours. Also, a game was supposed to have a definite end somewhere. In ''Monopoly'' you kept going around and around.\"<ref>{{Cite book|last=Brandreth|first=Gyles|authorlink=Gyles Brandreth|title=The Monopoly Omnibus|edition=First hardcover|year=1985|publisher=Willow Books|isbn=0-00-218166-5|page=19}}</ref>\n\nHasbro states that the longest game of ''Monopoly'' ever played lasted 1,680 hours (70 days or 10 weeks or 2.3 months).<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.hasbro.com/monopoly/en_US/discover/history.cfm |title=Monopoly History and Fun Facts |website=hasbro.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090810014137/http://www.hasbro.com/monopoly/en_US/discover/history.cfm |archive-date=August 10, 2009 |url-status=dead |access-date=September 2, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Related games==\n\n===Add-ons===\nNumerous add-ons have been produced for ''Monopoly'', sold independently from the game both before its commercialization and after, with three official ones discussed below:\n\n====''Stock Exchange''====\nThe original ''Stock Exchange'' add-on was published by Capitol Novelty Co. of [[Rensselaer, New York]] in early 1936.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/9466/monopoly-stock-exchange-add |title=Monopoly Stock Exchange |website=boardgamegeek.com |access-date=September 3, 2018}}</ref> It was marketed as an add-on for ''Monopoly'', ''Finance'', or ''Easy Money'' games. Shortly after Capitol Novelty introduced ''Stock Exchange'', Parker Brothers bought it from them then marketed their own, slightly redesigned, version as an add-on specifically for their \"new\" ''Monopoly'' game; the Parker Brothers version was available in June 1936. The Free Parking square is covered over by a new Stock Exchange space and the add-on included three Chance and three Community Chest cards directing the player to \"Advance to Stock Exchange\".<ref name=\"sxg\">{{cite web|title=1936 Stock Exchange Game|url=http://monopoly.cdbpdx.com/StEx/|accessdate=October 26, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe ''Stock Exchange'' add-on was later redesigned and re-released in 1992 under license by [[Chessex]], this time including a larger number of new Chance and Community Chest cards. This version included ten new Chance cards (five \"Advance to Stock Exchange\" and five other related cards) and eleven new Community Chest cards (five \"Advance to Stock Exchange\" and six other related cards; the regular Community Chest card \"From sale of stock you get $45\" is removed from play when using these cards). Many of the original rules applied to this new version (in fact, one optional play choice allows for playing in the original form by only adding the \"Advance to Stock Exchange\" cards to each deck).{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}\n\nA ''Monopoly Stock Exchange Edition'' was released in 2001 (although not in the U.S.), this time adding an electronic calculator-like device to keep track of the complex stock figures. This was a full edition, not just an add-on, that came with its own board, money and playing pieces. Properties on the board were replaced by companies on which shares could be floated, and offices and home offices (instead of houses and hotels) could be built.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/3065/monopoly-stock-exchange |title=Monopoly: Stock Exchange (2001) |website=boardgamegeek.com |access-date=September 3, 2018}}</ref>\n\n====Playmaster====\nPlaymaster, another official add-on, released in 1982, is an electronic device that keeps track of all player movement and dice rolls as well as what properties are still available. It then uses this information to call random auctions and mortgages making it easier to free up cards of a color group. It also plays eight short tunes when key game functions occur; for example when a player lands on a railroad it plays \"[[I've Been Working on the Railroad]]\", and a police car's siren sounds when a player goes to Jail.<ref>{{cite web|work=boardgamegeek.com|url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/5638 |title=BoardGameGeek.com page for the ''Monopoly'' Playmaster electronic accessory|accessdate=January 1, 2006}}</ref>\n\n====''Get Out of Jail'' and ''Free Parking'' Minigames====\nIn 2009, Hasbro released two minigames that can be played as stand-alone games or combined with the ''Monopoly'' game. In ''Get Out of Jail'', the goal is to manipulate a spade under a jail cell to flick out various colored prisoners.

For the 2003 Championship, qualification was limited to the first fifty people who correctly completed an online quiz. Out of concerns that such methods of qualifying might not always ensure a competition of the best players, the 2009 Championship qualifying was expanded to include an online multiple-choice quiz (a score of 80% or better was required to advance); followed by an online five-question essay test; followed by a two-game online tournament at Pogo.com. The process was to have produced a field of 23 plus one: [[Matthew McNally|Matt McNally]], the 2003 national champion, who received a bye and was not required to qualify. However, at the end of the online tournament, there was an eleven-way tie for the last six spots. The decision was made to invite all of those who had tied for said spots. In fact, two of those who had tied and would have otherwise been eliminated, Dale Crabtree of Indianapolis, Indiana, and Brandon Baker, of Tuscaloosa, Alabama, played in the final game and finished third and fourth respectively.<ref name=\"Tostado, Kevin 2010\">Tostado, Kevin.

The new game uses its own currency unit, the Monopolonian (a game-based take on the Euro; designated by '''<s>M</s>'''). The game uses said unit in millions and thousands. As seen below, there is no dark purple color-group, as that is replaced by brown, as in the European version of the game.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}\n\nIt is also notable that three cities ([[Montreal]], [[Toronto]], and [[Vancouver]]) are from Canada and three other cities (Beijing, Hong Kong, and Shanghai) are from the People's Republic of China.

The cited phrase, \"Do not pass Go. Do not collect $200\", distinguishes the effect from other cards that move players; other cards use the phrasing \"Advance to [a particular location]\", which does allow the player to collect $200 if they pass Go during the advance.

In the game, players roll two six-sided dice to move around the game board, buying and trading properties, and developing them with houses and hotels. Players collect rent from their opponents, with the goal being to drive them into [[bankruptcy]]. Money can also be gained or lost through Chance and Community Chest cards, and tax squares; players can end up in jail, which they cannot move from until they have met one of several conditions. The game has numerous [[house rules]], and hundreds of different editions exist, as well as many spin-offs and related media. ''Monopoly'' has become a part of international popular culture, having been licensed locally in more than 103 countries and printed in more than 37 languages.\n\n''Monopoly'' is derived from ''[[The Landlord's Game]]'' created by [[Lizzie Magie]] in the United States in 1903 as a way to demonstrate that an economy which rewards wealth creation is better than one where monopolists work under few constraints,<ref name=\"NYT-20150213\" /> and to promote the economic theories of [[Henry George]]\u2014in particular his [[Georgism|ideas about taxation]].<ref>{{cite web|authorlink=Erica Wagner|author=Wagner, Erica|work=[[New Statesman]]|title=Do not pass go: the tangled roots of Monopoly|date=24 June 2015|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/culture/2015/06/do-not-pass-go-tangled-roots-monopoly}}</ref> It was first published by [[Parker Brothers]] in 1935 until that firm was eventually absorbed into Hasbro in 1991.

It was intended as an educational tool to illustrate the negative aspects of concentrating land in private [[Monopoly|monopolies]]. She took out a patent in 1904. Her game, ''[[The Landlord's Game]]'', was self-published, beginning in 1906.<ref>{{cite book |last=Orbanes |first=Philip E. |title=Monopoly: The World's Most Famous Game & How it Got that Way |year=2006 |publisher=Da Capo Press |isbn=0-306-81489-7 |page=[https://archive.org/details/monopoly00phil/page/22 22] |authorlink=Philip Orbanes |url=https://archive.org/details/monopoly00phil/page/22 }}</ref>\n\nMagie created two sets of rules: an anti-monopolist set in which all were rewarded when wealth was created, and a monopolist set in which the goal was to create monopolies and crush opponents.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/apr/11/secret-history-monopoly-capitalist-game-leftwing-origins|title=The secret history of Monopoly: the capitalist board game's leftwing origins|newspaper=The Guardian|date=11 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nSeveral variant board games, based on her concept, were developed from 1906 through the 1930s; they involved both the process of buying land for its development and the sale of any undeveloped property. Cardboard houses were added and rents increased as they were added to a property.

After the meal, the Todds introduced Darrow to ''The Landlord's Game'', which they then played several times. The game was entirely new to Darrow, and he asked the Todds for a written set of the rules. After that night, Darrow went on to utilize this and distribute the game himself as ''Monopoly''.

A standard set of ''Monopoly'' pieces includes:\n\n===Cards===\nA deck of thirty-two Chance and Community Chest cards (sixteen each) which players draw when they land on the corresponding squares of the track, and follow the instructions printed on them.\n\n===Deeds===\nA [[deed|title deed]] for each property is given to a player to signify ownership, and specifies purchase price, [[Mortgage law|mortgage]] value, the cost of building houses and hotels on that property, and the various [[renting|rents]] depending on how developed the property is. Properties include:\n* Twenty-two streets divided into eight color groups of two or three streets; a player must own all of a color group to build houses or hotels. Once achieved, color group properties must be improved or \"broken down\" evenly. See the section on Rules.\n* Four railroads, players collect $25 rent if they own one railroad; $50 for two; $100 for three; $200 for all four. These are usually replaced by railroad stations in non-U.S. editions of Monopoly.\n* Two [[public utility|utilities]], rent is four times the dice value if one utility is owned, but ten times if both are owned. Hotels and houses cannot be built on utilities or stations. Some country editions have a fixed rent for utilities; for example, the Italian editions has a L. 2,000 ($20) rent if one utility is owned, or L. 10,000 ($100) if both are owned.\n\nThe purchase price for properties varies from $60 to $400 on a U.S. Standard Edition set.\n\n===Dice===\n[[File:Monopoly Dice.png|thumb|2 standard dice, included in the original Monopoly Board Game.]]\nA pair of six-sided [[dice]] is included, with a \"[[#Speed Die|Speed Die]]\" added for variation in 2007.

Unlike money, houses and hotels have a finite supply. If no more are available, no substitute is allowed. In most editions, houses are green and hotels red.\n\n===Money===\n{{Main|Monopoly money}}\n\nOlder U.S. standard editions of the game included a total of '''$15,140''' in the following denominations:\n* 20 $500 bills (orange)\n* 20 $100 bills (beige)\n* 30 $50 bills (blue)\n* 50 $20 bills (green)\n* 40 $10 bills (yellow)\n* 40 $5 bills (pink)\n* 40 $1 bills (white)\n\nNewer (September 2008 and later) U.S. editions provide a total of '''$20,580'''\u201330 of each denomination instead. The colors of some of the bills are also changed: $10s are now blue instead of yellow, $20s are a brighter green than before, and $50s are now purple instead of blue.\n\nEach player begins the game with his or her token on the Go square, and $1,500 (or 1,500 of a localized currency) in play money ($2,500 with the Speed Die). Before September 2008, the money was divided with greater numbers of 20 and 10-dollar bills. Since then, the U.S. version has taken on the British version's initial cash distributions.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! U.S. editions prior to 2008 !!

However, the amount of cash contained in the game is enough for eight players with a slight alteration of bill distribution.\n\n====International currencies====\nPre-Euro German editions of the game started with 30,000 \"Spielmark\" in eight denominations (abbreviated as \"M.\"), and later used seven denominations of the \"Deutsche Mark\" (\"DM.\"). In the classic Italian game, each player received L. 350,000 ($3500) in a two-player game, but L. 50,000 ($500) less for each player more than two. Only in a six-player game does a player receive the equivalent of $1,500. The classic Italian games were played with only four denominations of currency. Both Spanish editions (the Barcelona and Madrid editions) started the game with 150,000 in play money, with a breakdown identical to that of the American version.\n\n====Extra currency====\nAccording to the Parker Brothers rules, Monopoly money is theoretically unlimited; if the bank runs out of money it may issue as much as needed \"by merely writing on any ordinary paper\".<ref>{{cite book |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Monopoly (rules) |url= |publisher=Parker Brothers |page= |date=1973 |location=Salem, Massachusetts |isbn=}}</ref>\nHowever, Hasbro's published Monopoly rules make no mention of this.<ref>{{cite book |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |url=https://www.hasbro.com/common/documents/dad288661c4311ddbd0b0800200c9a66/97DF546B6BF64A70A2A759D3FA5BD804.pdf\n|title=Monopoly (rules)|publisher=Hasbro |date=2016 |location=Pawtucket, Rhode Island}}</ref> Additional paper money can be bought at certain locations, notably game and hobby stores, or downloaded from various websites and printed and cut by hand.

One of the first tokens to come out included a [[Steam locomotive|Steam Locomotive]] which was only released in Deluxe Editions. A Director's Chair token was released in 2011 in limited edition copies of ''[[Under the Boardwalk: The Monopoly Story]]''. Shortly after the 2013 Facebook voting campaign, a limited-edition Golden Token set was released exclusively at various national retailers, such as Target in the U.S., and Tesco in the U.K.<ref name=\"tesc\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.tesco.com/direct/monopoly-limited-edition/674-7141.prd |title=Monopoly Limited Edition|website=tesco.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160117030303/http://www.tesco.com/direct/monopoly-limited-edition/674-7141.prd |archive-date=January 17, 2016 |url-status=dead |access-date=September 2, 2018}}</ref> \n\nThe set contained the Battleship, Boot, Iron, Racecar, Scottie Dog, Thimble, Top hat and Wheelbarrow as well as the iron's potential replacements. These replacement tokens included the cat, the guitar, the diamond ring, the helicopter, and the robot.<ref name=\"cbsn0\" /><ref name=cbsn /><ref name=\"tesc\" /> Hasbro released a 64-token limited edition set in 2017 called Monopoly Signature Token Collection to include all of the candidates that were not chosen in the vote held that year.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://shop.hasbro.com/en-in/product/monopoly-signature-token-collection:D73E2FB3-5056-9047-F5BD-9377C9CF51F4 |title=Monopoly Signature Token Collection |website=hasbro.com |access-date=September 2, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Rules==\n\n===Official rules===\n\nPlayers take turns in order with the initial player determined by chance before the game. A typical turn begins with the rolling of the dice and advancing a piece clockwise around the board the corresponding number of squares. If a player rolls doubles, they roll again after completing that portion of their turn. A player who rolls three consecutive sets of doubles on one turn has been \"caught speeding\" and is immediately sent to jail instead of moving the amount shown on the dice for the third roll.\n\nA player who lands on or passes the Go space collects $200 from the bank. Players who land on either Income Tax or Luxury Tax pay the indicated amount to the bank. In older editions of the game, two options were given for Income Tax: either pay a flat fee of $200 or 10% of total net worth (including the current values of all the properties and buildings owned). No calculation could be made before the choice, and no latitude was given for reversing an unwise calculation. In 2008, the calculation option was removed from the official rules, and simultaneously the Luxury Tax was increased to $100 from its original $75. No reward or penalty is given for landing on Free Parking.\n\nProperties can only be developed once a player owns all the properties in that color group. They then must be developed equally. A house must be built on each property of that color before a second can be built. Each property within a group must be within one house level of all the others within that group.\n\n====Chance/Community Chest====\n\nIf a player lands on a Chance or Community Chest space, they draw the top card from the respective deck and follow its instructions. This may include collecting or paying money to the bank or another player or moving to a different space on the board. Two types of cards that involve jail, \"Go to Jail\" and \"[[Get Out of Jail Free card|Get Out of Jail Free]]\", are explained below.\n\n====Jail====\nA player is sent to jail for doing any of the following:\n* Landing directly on \"Go to Jail\"\n* Throwing three consecutive doubles in one turn\n* Drawing a \"Go to Jail\" card from Chance or Community Chest\n\nWhen a player is sent to jail, they move directly to the Jail space and their turn ends (\"[[Do not pass Go. Do not collect $200.]]\"). If an ordinary dice roll (not one of the above events) ends with the player's token on the Jail corner, they are \"Just Visiting\" and can move ahead on their next turn without incurring any penalty.\n\nIf a player is in jail, they do not take a normal turn and must either pay a fine of $50 to be released, use a Chance or Community Chest Get Out of Jail Free card, or attempt to roll doubles on the dice. If a player fails to roll doubles, they lose their turn. Failing to roll doubles for three consecutive turns requires the player to either pay the $50 fine or use a Get Out of Jail Free card, after which they move ahead according to the total rolled. Players in jail may not buy properties directly from the bank since they are unable to move. They can engage all other transactions, such as mortgaging properties, selling/trading properties to other players, buying/selling houses and hotels, collecting rent, and bidding on property auctions. A player who rolls doubles to leave jail does not roll again; however, if the player pays the fine or uses a card to get out and then rolls doubles, they do take another turn.\n\n====Properties====\nIf the player lands on an unowned property, whether street, railroad, or utility, they can buy the property for its listed purchase price. If they decline this purchase, the property is auctioned off by the bank to the highest bidder, including the player who declined to buy.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/life/news/a47100/monopoly-auction-rule/ |title=We Just Discovered a Game-Changing Monopoly Rule |website=goodhousekeeping.com |access-date=September 2, 2018|date=November 29, 2017 }}</ref> If the property landed on is already owned and unmortgaged, they must pay the owner a given rent; the amount depends on whether the property is part of a set or its level of development.\n\nWhen a player owns all the properties in a color group and none of them are mortgaged, they may develop them during their turn or in between other player's turns. Development involves buying miniature houses or hotels from the bank and placing them on the property spaces; this must be done uniformly across the group. That is, a second house cannot be built on any property within a group until all of them have one house. Once the player owns an entire group, they can collect double rent for any undeveloped properties within it. Although houses and hotels cannot be built on railroads or utilities, the given rent increases if a player owns more than one of either type. If there is a housing shortage (more demand for houses to be built than what remains in the bank), then a housing auction is conducted to determine who will get to purchase each house.\n\n====Mortgaging====\nProperties can also be mortgaged, although all developments on a monopoly must be sold before any property of that color can be mortgaged or traded. The player receives half the purchase price from the bank for each mortgaged property. This must be repaid with 10% interest to clear the mortgage. Houses and hotels can be sold back to the bank for half their purchase price. Players cannot collect rent on mortgaged properties and may not give improved property away to others; however, trading mortgaged properties is allowed. The player receiving the mortgaged property must immediately pay the bank the mortgage price plus 10% or pay just the 10% amount and keep the property mortgaged; if the player chooses the latter, they must pay the 10% again when they pay off the mortgage.\n\n====Bankruptcy====\nA player who cannot pay what they owe is bankrupt and eliminated from the game. If the bankrupt player owes the bank, they must turn all their assets over to the bank, who then auctions off their properties (if they have any), except buildings. If the debt is owed to another player instead, all assets are given to that opponent, except buildings which must be returned to the bank. The new owner must either pay off any mortgages held by the bank on such properties received or pay a fee of 10% of the mortgaged value to the bank if they choose to leave the properties mortgaged. The winner is the remaining player left after all of the others have gone bankrupt.\n\nIf a player runs out of money but still has assets that can be converted to cash, they can do so by selling buildings, mortgaging properties, or trading with other players. To avoid bankruptcy the player must be able to raise enough cash to pay the full amount owed.\n\nA player cannot choose to go bankrupt; if there is any way to pay what they owe, even by returning all their buildings at a loss, mortgaging all their real estate and giving up all their cash, even knowing they are likely going bankrupt the next time, they must do so.\n\n===Official Short Game rules===\nFrom 1936, the rules booklet included with each Monopoly set contained a short section at the end providing rules for making the game shorter, including dealing out two Title Deed cards to each player before starting the game, by setting a time limit or by ending the game after the second player goes bankrupt. A later version of the rules included this variant, along with the time limit game, in the main rules booklet, omitting the last, the second bankruptcy method, as a third short game.<ref>{{Cite book | author=Brady, Maxine | title=The Monopoly Book | publisher=David McKay Company | year=1974 | isbn=0-679-20292-7 | pages=[https://archive.org/details/monopolybookstra00brad/page/143 143\u2013144] | url=https://archive.org/details/monopolybookstra00brad/page/143 | author-link=Maxine Brady }}</ref>\n\n===House rules===\n{{rquote|right|[V]irtually no one plays the game with the rules as written.|''Computer Gaming World'', 1994<ref name=\"cgw199408\">{{Cite magazine\n |last=\n |first=\n |author=\n |last2=\n |first2=\n |date=August 1994\n |title=These Just In\n |department=Now Playing\n |url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1994&pub=2&id=121\n |magazine=Computer Gaming World\n |pages=152\u2013156\n |type=\n}}</ref>}}\n\nMany [[house rules]] have emerged for the game throughout its history. Well-known is the \"Free Parking jackpot rule\", where all the money collected from Income Tax, Luxury Tax, Chance and Community Chest goes to the center of the board instead of the bank. Many people add $500 to start each pile of Free Parking money, guaranteeing a minimum payout. When a player lands on Free Parking, they may take the money. Another rule is that if a player lands directly on Go, they collect double the amount, or $400, instead of $200. Since these rules provide additional cash to players regardless of their property management choices, they can lengthen the game considerably and limit the role of strategy.<ref name=\"ditch\">{{cite web|last=Dove |first=Laurie L. |url=http://www.howstuffworks.com/leisure/brain-games/5-monopoly-house-rules-you-should-ditch.htm |title=5 Monopoly House Rules You Should Ditch |publisher=Howstuffworks.com |accessdate=July 11, 2013|date=February 7, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nVideo game and computer game versions of ''Monopoly'' have options where popular house rules can be used. In 2014, Hasbro determined five popular house rules by public Facebook vote, and released a \"House Rules Edition\" of the board game. Rules selected include a \"Free Parking\" house rule without additional money and forcing players to traverse the board once before buying properties.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/hasbro-unveils-worlds-favorite-house-rules-to-be-included-in-future-monopoly-games-2014-04-04|title=Hasbro Unveils World's Favorite \"House Rules\" to Be Included in Future Monopoly Games|work=MarketWatch}}</ref>\n\n==Strategy==\nAccording to Jim Slater in ''[[The Mayfair Set]]'', the Orange property group is the best to own because players land on them more often, as a result of the Chance cards \"Go to Jail\", \"Advance to St. Charles Place (Pall Mall)\", \"Advance to Reading Railroad (Kings Cross Station)\" and \"Go Back Three Spaces\".<ref>{{YouTube|id=PdQ3ztGk0D4|title=The Mayfair Set \u2013 Episode 4 (Adam Curtis, BBC}}</ref>\n\nIn all, during game play, Illinois Avenue (Trafalgar Square) (Red), New York Avenue (Vine Street) (Orange), B&O Railroad (Fenchurch Street Station), and Reading Railroad (Kings Cross Station) are the most frequently landed-upon properties. Mediterranean Avenue (Old Kent Road) (brown), Baltic Avenue (Whitechapel Road) (brown), Park Place (Park Lane) (blue), and Oriental Avenue (The Angel, Islington) (light blue) are the least-landed-upon properties. Among the property groups, the Railroads are most frequently landed upon, as no other group has four properties; Orange has the next highest frequency, followed by Red.<ref>{{cite web| first=Truman| last=Collins| url=http://www.tkcs-collins.com/truman/monopoly/monopoly.shtml| title=Monopoly Square Probabilities| year=1997| accessdate=May 28, 2006}}; the page includes detailed analyses of expected income from each property and discussion of the strategic implications.</ref>\n\n===End game===\nOne common criticism of ''Monopoly'' is that although it has carefully defined termination conditions, it may take an unlimited amount of time to reach them. Edward P. Parker, a former president of [[Parker Brothers]], is quoted as saying, \"We always felt that forty-five minutes was about the right length for a game, but ''Monopoly'' could go on for hours. Also, a game was supposed to have a definite end somewhere. In ''Monopoly'' you kept going around and around.\"<ref>{{Cite book|last=Brandreth|first=Gyles|authorlink=Gyles Brandreth|title=The Monopoly Omnibus|edition=First hardcover|year=1985|publisher=Willow Books|isbn=0-00-218166-5|page=19}}</ref>\n\nHasbro states that the longest game of ''Monopoly'' ever played lasted 1,680 hours (70 days or 10 weeks or 2.3 months).<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.hasbro.com/monopoly/en_US/discover/history.cfm |title=Monopoly History and Fun Facts |website=hasbro.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090810014137/http://www.hasbro.com/monopoly/en_US/discover/history.cfm |archive-date=August 10, 2009 |url-status=dead |access-date=September 2, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Related games==\n\n===Add-ons===\nNumerous add-ons have been produced for ''Monopoly'', sold independently from the game both before its commercialization and after, with three official ones discussed below:\n\n====''Stock Exchange''====\nThe original ''Stock Exchange'' add-on was published by Capitol Novelty Co. of [[Rensselaer, New York]] in early 1936.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/9466/monopoly-stock-exchange-add |title=Monopoly Stock Exchange |website=boardgamegeek.com |access-date=September 3, 2018}}</ref> It was marketed as an add-on for ''Monopoly'', ''Finance'', or ''Easy Money'' games. Shortly after Capitol Novelty introduced ''Stock Exchange'', Parker Brothers bought it from them then marketed their own, slightly redesigned, version as an add-on specifically for their \"new\" ''Monopoly'' game; the Parker Brothers version was available in June 1936. The Free Parking square is covered over by a new Stock Exchange space and the add-on included three Chance and three Community Chest cards directing the player to \"Advance to Stock Exchange\".<ref name=\"sxg\">{{cite web|title=1936 Stock Exchange Game|url=http://monopoly.cdbpdx.com/StEx/|accessdate=October 26, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe ''Stock Exchange'' add-on was later redesigned and re-released in 1992 under license by [[Chessex]], this time including a larger number of new Chance and Community Chest cards. This version included ten new Chance cards (five \"Advance to Stock Exchange\" and five other related cards) and eleven new Community Chest cards (five \"Advance to Stock Exchange\" and six other related cards; the regular Community Chest card \"From sale of stock you get $45\" is removed from play when using these cards). Many of the original rules applied to this new version (in fact, one optional play choice allows for playing in the original form by only adding the \"Advance to Stock Exchange\" cards to each deck).{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}\n\nA ''Monopoly Stock Exchange Edition'' was released in 2001 (although not in the U.S.), this time adding an electronic calculator-like device to keep track of the complex stock figures. This was a full edition, not just an add-on, that came with its own board, money and playing pieces. Properties on the board were replaced by companies on which shares could be floated, and offices and home offices (instead of houses and hotels) could be built.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/3065/monopoly-stock-exchange |title=Monopoly: Stock Exchange (2001) |website=boardgamegeek.com |access-date=September 3, 2018}}</ref>\n\n====Playmaster====\nPlaymaster, another official add-on, released in 1982, is an electronic device that keeps track of all player movement and dice rolls as well as what properties are still available. It then uses this information to call random auctions and mortgages making it easier to free up cards of a color group. It also plays eight short tunes when key game functions occur; for example when a player lands on a railroad it plays \"[[I've Been Working on the Railroad]]\", and a police car's siren sounds when a player goes to Jail.<ref>{{cite web|work=boardgamegeek.com|url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/5638 |title=BoardGameGeek.com page for the ''Monopoly'' Playmaster electronic accessory|accessdate=January 1, 2006}}</ref>\n\n====''Get Out of Jail'' and ''Free Parking'' Minigames====\nIn 2009, Hasbro released two minigames that can be played as stand-alone games or combined with the ''Monopoly'' game. In ''Get Out of Jail'', the goal is to manipulate a spade under a jail cell to flick out various colored prisoners. The game can be used as an alternative to rolling doubles to get out of jail.<ref>{{cite web|work=boardgamegeek.com|url=http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/64611/monopoly-get-out-of-jail-mini-game |title=BoardGameGeek.com page for the ''Monopoly'' Get Out of Jail Mini Game|accessdate=October 21, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|work=hasbro.com|url=http://www.hasbro.com/monopoly/en_US/shop/details.cfm?R=99DA05B8-19B9-F369-108F-46A65BBC8780:en_US |title=Hasbro.com page for the ''Monopoly'' Get Out of Jail Mini Game|accessdate=October 22, 2012}}</ref> In ''Free Parking'', players attempt to balance taxis on a wobbly board.

If \"Mr. Monopoly\" is rolled while there are unowned properties, the player advances forward to the nearest one. Otherwise, the player advances to the nearest property on which rent is owed.

The cited phrase, \"Do not pass Go. Do not collect $200\", distinguishes the effect from other cards that move players; other cards use the phrasing \"Advance to [a particular location]\", which does allow the player to collect $200 if they pass Go during the advance.

Branner (son of university president [[John Casper Branner]]) in 1914.  Camerino, who did not appraise the damage until 1913, restored the interior mosaics.  He had saved the original drawings in Venice, so he removed and re-fabricated the [[chancel]] mosaic, and redesigned the entire exterior mosaic.<ref name=\"history\"/>  The Stanford alumni magazine, in early 1917, after the completion of the interior mosaics, declared the renovation complete, stating that \"the church, for almost the first time since it was begun, is finished\".<ref name=\"gregg-26\"/>  Its appearance after the renovation was \"significantly transformed\".<ref name=\"quake\"/>\n\nIn 1989 the church was damaged again, in the [[Loma Prieta earthquake]].  Although the damage was not as serious as the '06 earthquake, it \"spurred intricate strengthening and restoration work\" to protect further damage from future earthquakes.<ref name=\"quake\"/>  The Stanford Quake \u201806 Centennial Alliance stated that the damage was not devastating, even though the building did not fulfill the more stringent earthquake codes in place in 1989, because of the previous renovation after the '06 earthquake.  The Alliance also stated that if the earthquake had been stronger or lasted longer, the damage would have been more extensive.<ref name=\"quake\"/>  The integrity of the structure remained,<ref name=\"history\"/> but the crossing structure, the only major part of the building that was not dismantled and replaced after the 1906 earthquake, buckled and caused several stones in the north and west arches to slip as much as {{convert|2|in|cm}}.<ref name=\"gregg-30\">Gregg, p. 30</ref>\n\nThe four mosaic angels in the pendentives, which decorated its high rounded walls directly below the church's dome and served as the setting beds for hundreds of thousands of [[tessera]]e, were severely damaged.<ref name=\"kreysler\"/>  Parts of the fallen mosaics were stolen, but later returned anonymously.<ref name=\"quake\"/>  The angels' damage caused large chunks of mortar and glass to fall to the floor {{convert|80|ft|m}} below, while other sections \"were left hanging by the sheer geometry of their arched shape\".<ref name=\"kreysler\">{{cite journal | last = Kreysler | first = William | title = In Defiance of Gravity: The Restoration of Stanford's Angels | journal = Flash Point | volume = 6 | issue = 2 }}</ref>  An eight-foot mosaic section of an angel's left wing in the church's northeast corner fell {{convert|70|ft|m}} to the floor.  Several stones from the east arch wall fell onto pews in the balcony, and the organ-loft railing collapsed inward. Although the damage was minor, the church remained closed until 1992 while restoration, as well as a bracing project to protect the building from future earthquakes, without changing the building's decorations, was carried out.  The university hired a team of contractors, structural engineers, architects, and conservation specialists to develop a renovation plan, which was paid for by a $10 million fundraising drive.  Many donations came from undergraduates, and the university's board of trustees approved the plan before its funding was in place because they recognized the church's importance to Stanford.<ref>Gregg, pp. 30\u201331</ref><ref name=\"quake\"/>\n\nIn this restoration, the entire crossing was strengthened by bracing it behind the dome and securing it to the superstructure of the building.<ref name=\"gregg-30\"/>  The restoration team evaluated every decoration in the church and made improvements and changes as necessary, in order to preserve the building's interior elements.

David Charles Gardner offered a course in Biblical history and literature beginning in 1907, and by 1910, he was teaching [[New Testament Greek]] and Bible classes.  Gardner's successor, [[D. Elton Trueblood]], whose goal was the establishment of a non-denominational graduate school in religious studies at Stanford, taught classes about the [[philosophy of religion]].  In 1941 Trueblood's efforts to expand the study of religion resulted in the creation of a minor in religion, as well as twenty-one courses offered by him and four faculty members.  By 1960, the chaplains of Stanford Memorial Church no longer had to run the program, which had expanded to allow students the option of majoring in the study of religion.<ref>Harvey, pp. 4\u20136</ref>  By the mid-1960s, the religious studies program at Stanford was enjoying \"enormous success\".<ref>Harvey, p. 6</ref>\n\nIn the 1960s, the study of religion at Stanford began to focus more on social and ethical issues like race and the [[Vietnam War]].

A round-shaped room is at the back of the building, added in 1902 by architect Clinton Day.<ref name=\"joncas-28\"/>\n\n=== Exterior ===\nThe chief building material of the church is buff [[sandstone]], which came from the Goodrich Quarry (also called the Greystone Quarry)<ref>{{cite web | title = Santa Clara County \u2013 List of Stone Quarries, Etc. | publisher = Stone Quarries and Beyond | url = http://quarriesandbeyond.org/states/ca/quarry_photo/ca-santa_clara_photos.html | accessdate = 31 January 2018}}</ref> in the Almaden area of San Jose, was delivered by train and rough-cut in the university Quad.  Gregg credits the high quality of the stonework to church and university builder John D. McGilvray.<ref name=\"gregg-22\">Gregg, p. 22</ref>  The church is roofed with terracotta tiles of the Italian [[imbrex and tegula]] form. The nave, chancel, and transepts appear to project from the square central structure, roofed with tiles and a small skylight above its center.  Memorial Church originally had a central bell tower with an 80-foot tall, twelve-sided spire, but this was lost as a result of the 1906 earthquake.<ref name=\"quake\"/>\n\nThe church's [[facade]] is surmounted by a simple [[Celtic cross]], a motif that appears several times throughout the building.<ref name=\"gregg-36\">Gregg, p. 36</ref>  The cross was added after the 1906 earthquake; its central shaft was destroyed in the Loma Prieta earthquake and replaced.<ref>Gregg, pp. 36\u201337</ref>  There are three arched entrances below the exterior mosaic; the central one is slightly larger than the others.<ref name=\"hall-17\"/>  The surrounding stonework is intricately carved with stylized flora, twisted-cable moldings, and bosses of sculpted cherubim, a motif which occurs in different media throughout the church. In the spandrels are mosaic depictions of the biblical concepts of love, faith, hope and charity intertwined in a vine representing the \"[[tree of life]]\".<ref name=\"hall-17\"/><ref group=note>Love is represented by a mother with wings encircling children.</ref>\n\nIn the upper zone of the facade, surrounded by more elaborate stonework and \"lacy carving\",<ref name=\"hall-17\"/> is a large central window, with groups of three smaller windows on each side.  The original central window was a quatrefoil-shaped [[rose window]], but after the 1906 earthquake, it was replaced by a \"classical round-head window that more grandly restates the smaller flanking, articulated openings\"<ref name=\"joncas-28\"/> and that corresponded with the [[Mission Revival Style architecture|mission-style architecture]] of the Quad.<ref name=\"gregg-26\"/>  Beneath the windows are inlaid panels of colored marble.\n\nThe gable and surrounding surfaces contain the church's largest mosaic, created by Maurizio Camerino's studio, which they rebuilt after the 1906 earthquake.<ref name=\"watercolors\"/>  Measuring {{convert|84|ft|m}} wide at the base and {{convert|30|ft|m}} in height, at the time of its completion, it was the largest mosaic in the U.S. It depicts a group of men, women and children, 47 in all, surrounding and \"paying close heed\"<ref name=\"hall-17\">Hall, p. 17</ref> to Christ, the mosaic's central figure, and includes a landscape with \"waving palms and a gleaming sky\"<ref name=\"hall-17\"/> behind Christ.   The exterior mosaic took 12 men two years to complete.<ref name=\"watercolors\"/>\n\nAfter Jane Stanford's death, the mosaic popularly gained the name \"[[The Sermon on the Mount]]\", although Stanford University historian Richard Joncas insists that the mosaic does not depict the scene as described in the [[Gospel of Matthew]] and has referred to it as \"an indefinite biblical scene\".<ref name=\"joncas-28\"/> In the Stanford University press release about the 1992 gift of three watercolor studies for the church's mosaics, Paoletti's design for the facade is described as ''\"Christ Welcoming the Righteous into the Kingdom of God\"'', based on Matthew 25:34.<ref name=\"watercolors\"/>  Paoletti created another unfinished watercolor depicting \"[[The Last Judgment]]\", as another option for the facade mosaic, but it was evidently rejected by Stanford.<ref name=\"palmer\"/>\n\n{{multiple image\n | align     = center\n| direction = horizontal\n| image1    = Memchu hopedetail.jpg\n| width1    = 156\n| alt1      = A carving of the head and wings of an angel: above the angel is the bottom of a mosaic with the label \"HOPE\" and a margin which has a head with flowering ivy.\n| caption1  = Detail of the foliate carvings around the doors\n| image2    = Exterior mosaic2.jpg\n| width2    = 310\n| alt2      = Jesus, with His arms stretched out, welcomes people who are coming towards him from both sides.

Lamb]] of New York.<ref name=\"hall-35\">Hall, p. 35</ref>  Its exposed-timber ceilings are modeled after Boston's Trinity Church.<ref name=\"joncas-28\"/>\n\nThe church is entered through three bronze doors adorned with angels, a recurring motif throughout the church. The doors open up into a [[narthex]] or [[Vestibule (architecture)|vestibule]] decorated with mosaics on the walls, illuminated by the many colors of the stained glass windows, and stone carvings on the architectural details.<ref name=\"hall-17\"/> There is a variety of styles and motifs reflecting the hands of different craftsmen.  The mosaic that adorns the floor depicts the [[Lamb of God]] surrounded by the symbols of the [[Four evangelists|four gospel writers]]: [[Matthew the Evangelist|St. Matthew]] (the winged angel), [[Mark the Evangelist|St. Mark]] (the winged lion), [[Luke the Evangelist|St. Luke]] (the ox), and [[John the Apostle|St. John]] (the eagle).  Some of these symbols also appear in other areas of the church.<ref name=\"gregg-38\">Gregg, p. 38</ref>  A Celtic cross adorns the stained glass above the central wooden door that leads into the nave, and Latin epigraphs have been engraved above the two side doors.<ref>Gregg, p. 39</ref><ref group=note>''Domus Dei Aula Coeli'' (\"The house of God, the forecourt of heaven\") above the right door; ''Domus Dei Locus Orationis'' (\"The house of God, the house of prayer\") above the left door.</ref>\n\nAbove the [[narthex]] is an organ gallery. The nave is [[Arcade (architecture)|arcaded]] and has a single aisle on each side with clerestory windows above. Its walls, from the floor to the top of the clerestory, are decorated with 15 murals made of mosaics on each side, and depicts scenes from the Old Testament.<ref name=\"history\"/>  The exposed timber ceiling was inspired by Trinity Church and is constructed with tied [[Hammer beam roof|hammer beams]], which can be seen radiating in the chancel.  The floor of the church slopes downward towards the crossing.  The chancel and transepts are three semi-circular apses.<ref name=\"joncas-28\"/> They are separated from the broad central space by large semi-circular arches on stout columns with carved capitals. The transept apses each have a balcony with a concave balustrade.\n\nDirectly above the crossing is a [[dome]] supported on pendentives.  Around the base of the dome are decorative gilt bands, the lower depicting a scrolling vine. Jane Stanford intended the dome's decoration of to be of mosaic tiles showing a variety of symbols, but the church's builders thought it would make the dome too heavy, so the decorations were painted.<ref>Gregg, pp. 53, 57</ref>  On the [[spandrels]] of the pendentives are mosaics of four angels measuring {{convert|42|ft|m}} from wing tip to wing tip, rising from clouds.  The angels survived the 1906 earthquake, but the angel looking downward was severely damaged during the 1989 earthquake because an 8-foot section of its left wing fell {{convert|70|ft|m}}.<ref>Gregg, p. 53</ref>\n\nThe [[chancel]], according to Hall, contains \"artistic work of a kind seldom seen anywhere\".<ref name=\"hall-17\"/>  The raised tiled floor of the chancel curves outward into the body of the church, and is approached by seven marble steps. The [[sanctuary]] is raised further, and enclosed by a marble altar rail behind which is an altar carved from white Carrara [[marble]] by [[L.M. Avenali]].  The altar supports a \"simple unadorned brass cross that reflects the colors of the mosaics surrounding it.\"<ref name=\"gregg-50\">Gregg, p. 50</ref>  The cross was made by [[William van Erp]] and was dedicated to the memory of Jane Stanford in 1948.\n\n[[File:Memchu altar pulpit.jpg|thumb|left|Wide view of the chancel in Stanford Memorial Church|alt=A view into the chancel is framed on the right by the lectern supported by a standing brass angel. The chancel is semi-circular and has a roof on wooden beams. The upper walls have brightly coloured mosaics of prophets and angels. The white marble altar and mosaic reredos of \"The Last Supper\" can be seen.]]\nBehind the altar is a mosaic reproduction of Rosselli's \"[[Last Supper (Rosselli)|Last Supper]]\".  Around the lower walls of the chancel are twelve niches decorated with golden mosaic tiles. They hold candles, but originally held statues of the twelve apostles, destroyed in 1906 and were never replaced. According to local legend, the cherubim carved in stone above the golden niches and in the pillars' capitals are illustrations of children living on campus at the time of the church's construction.<ref name=\"gregg-50\"/>  To the west side of the chancel stands brass lectern in the form of a reading angel, which Jane Stanford brought from Europe and dedicated to her husband on the anniversary of his birth in 1902.<ref>Gregg, p. 46</ref>\n\nThree stained glass windows in the apse depict the [[Nativity of Jesus|nativity]], [[crucifixion]], and [[Ascension of Jesus|ascension]] of Christ.  The mosaics between them show angels, those on the left carrying a cross, those on the right carrying a crown. On the longer sections of the chancel wall, on either side of the windows, are mosaics depicting a choir of angels. Above them is a tier of mosaics with representations of the prophets and kings of Israel. Other mosaics abound in the transepts, clerestory, and the choir loft at the northern end of the church.  A series of mosaics in the upper transepts depict Old Testament figures on the east side and Christian saints on the west side. On Jane Stanford's direction, they alternate male and female.<ref name=\"gregg-57\"/>\n\nThe arches, balcony rails, and pillars throughout the church have relief carvings created by a team of 10 men who worked for two years from [[scaffolding]].<ref>Gregg, p. 58</ref>  A large double pillar before the entrance of the west transept have inscriptions dedicated to members of the Stanford family.  After the 1989 earthquake, a third of the west transept was converted into a small chapel.  The altar and chairs in this chapel were designed by Bay Area artist [[Gail Fredell]] who decorated the chapel's altar by using Salvatti's original mosaics, which had been stored since the church's reconstruction following the 1906 earthquake.<ref>Gregg, pp. 42, 45</ref>\n\n==== Windows ====\n[[File:Stanfordchurch-ascension.jpg|thumb|A window in the nave shows Christ welcoming a soul into Heaven, a reference to the death of Leland Stanford, Jr.|alt=This stained-glass window shows two angels carrying a small child up towards Christ seated on golden clouds in while a group of people below are watching.]]\n\nAccording to architectural historian Willis L. Hall, the church's 20 large [[stained glass windows]] \"are as much a feature of the church as the mosaics\".<ref name=\"hall-35\"/>  The windows, designed by Frederick Stymetz Lamb (1863\u20131928) and fabricated by J&R Lamb Studios, his father's firm in New York City, took three years to complete,<ref name=\"glass\"/> and eight months to install at Stanford.<ref>Gregg, p. 60</ref>  Jane Stanford hired Lamb because she felt he was more interested in \"the ecclesiastical rather than commercial aspect of the work\".<ref>Gregg, p. 21</ref>  The installation of the windows at Stanford Memorial Church was the largest commission awarded to an American stained glass artist at the time, and the project is \"considered the finest example of Lamb's work\".<ref name=\"gregg-22\"/>  The window have a different appearance when viewed from the outside of the building because the reflected light highlights the textures of the glass panels, created by using many layers of different colored glass.<ref>Gregg, p. 62</ref>\n\nStanford chose the life of Christ for the windows' theme, inspired by the religious paintings by European master painters such as [[Frederic Shields]] and [[Gustave Dor\u00e9]].  The windows have a section at the bottom with the scriptural quotations their images depict; the larger windows also include their titles.<ref name=\"hall-35\"/>  Stanford's personal touch is shown in one of the [[nave]] windows, which is based on a cartoon by Paoletti and depicts Christ welcoming the soul of a child into Heaven before the eyes of its grieving mother, an allusion to the death of [[Leland Stanford, Jr.]],<ref name=\"glass\"/> the Stanfords' only child and the university's namesake, who died in 1884 of [[typhoid]] shortly before his 16th birthday.\n\nOberhausen, who has studied the source of the mosaics and windows, states that at least four stained glass windows were inspired by the paintings of Pre-Raphaelite artists that were enjoying a resurgence in popularity at the time.  These windows are: \"Christ in the Temple\" in the east transept, based upon a painting by [[William Holman Hunt]]; \"The Annunciation\" in the east nave, inspired by a work by [[Frederic Shields]]; \"The Nativity\" in the chancel, based upon a painting by [[Edward Fellowes-Prynne]]; and \"The Good Shepherd\" in the west transept, inspired by a painting by Sibyl C. Parker, the only female artist represented in the artwork of the church.<ref name=\"oberhausen-3\"/>  None of the windows of Stanford Memorial Church required replacement after the 1906 quake, except for \"the famous rose window of the original structure\" in the organ loft which was replaced by the current large, central arch window.<ref name=\"hall-35\"/>  This window, entitled \"Lilies of the Field\", is the only window in the church that cannot be viewed from the inside because it is blocked off by the central organ.<ref name=\"gregg-37\"/>  There is a cross in the center of this window made of \"faceted pieces of glass that are inset like gems\",<ref name=\"gregg-37\">Gregg, p. 37</ref> which sparkle when light strikes it.\n\nThe church's clerestory contains many smaller windows of individuals from the Bible or Christian history.  The windows in the nave above the east arcade depict the following Old Testament figures: [[Abraham]], [[Hagar (Bible)|Hagar]] and her child [[Ishmael]], [[Moses]], [[Bithiah|Pharaoh's Daughter]], [[Joshua]], and [[Deborah]].  The windows in the east transept depict [[David]], [[Book of Ruth|Ruth]], [[Solomon]], [[The Queen of Sheba]], [[Elijah]], [[Esther]], [[Isaiah]], [[Judith]], [[Daniel (biblical figure)|Daniel]], and [[Hannah (Bible)|Hannah]].  In the nave above the west arcade feature saints and virtues: [[Saint Stephen|Stephen]], [[Agnes of Rome|Agnes]], [[Saint Peter|Peter]], [[Priscilla and Aquila|Priscilla]], [[John the Apostle|John]], and [[Hope]].  In the west transept are [[Simeon (Gospel of Luke)|Simeon]], [[Saint Anne|Anne]], [[Matthew the Evangelist|Matthew]], [[Faith]], [[Mark the Evangelist|Mark]], [[Charity (virtue)|Charity]], [[Luke the Evangelist|Luke]], [[Dorcas]], [[Saint Paul|Paul]], and [[Martha of Bethany|Martha]].  The clerestory above the east and west doors are two windows of angels.  Unlike the other windows throughout the church, they do not receive natural light from outside and are artificially illuminated instead.\n{{Clear}}\n{{multiple image\n | align     = center\n| direction = horizontal\n| header    = Stanford Memorial Church's stained glass windows, at the east side of the church\n | header_align = center\n| image1   = USA-Palo Alto-Stanford Memorial Church-Glass Window-2.jpg\n| width1   = 173 | alt1      = The Virgin Mary kneels to receive the God's message from an angel.

One of the reasons she chose mosaics was because of the similar weather in Italy and Northern California, where the moderate climates and rainy seasons in both settings protect the images from erosion and clear the pollution that accumulates on many buildings in large cities.  As Hall states, the \"mosaics on the facade are always clear and brilliant.\"<ref>Hall, p. 19</ref>  During the Stanfords' 1883 tour of Europe, they visited [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine churches]] in [[Constantinople]] and [[St Mark's Basilica]] in Venice.  They met and befriended Maurizio Camerino, the manager of the [[Antonio Salviati]] studios, which had just completed restoring the mosaics at St Mark's.<ref name=\"watercolors\"/>\n\nStanford began working with Camerino, who by that time had bought the Salviati studios, in 1899, and spent two months in Venice in the fall of 1900, selecting the watercolors created as the mosaics' patterns by Camerino's chief designer, Antonio Paoletti.<ref name=\"gregg-18\"/><ref name=\"palmer\">{{cite news | last = Palmer | first = Barbara | title = Mosaic Exhibit Shows Rejected Design for Memorial Church | work = Stanford Report | url = http://news.stanford.edu/news/2004/february25/mosaic-225.html | date = 23 February 2004 | accessdate = 27 August 2017}}</ref>{{refn|group=note|In 1992, Camerino's family, in honor of the friendship between the Camerino and Stanford families, donated three watercolor studies of the Memorial Church mosaics, painted by Paoletti, to Stanford University.

He had saved the original drawings in Venice, so he removed and re-fabricated the [[chancel]] mosaic, and redesigned the entire exterior mosaic.<ref name=\"history\"/>  The Stanford alumni magazine, in early 1917, after the completion of the interior mosaics, declared the renovation complete, stating that \"the church, for almost the first time since it was begun, is finished\".<ref name=\"gregg-26\"/>  Its appearance after the renovation was \"significantly transformed\".<ref name=\"quake\"/>\n\nIn 1989 the church was damaged again, in the [[Loma Prieta earthquake]].

Several stones from the east arch wall fell onto pews in the balcony, and the organ-loft railing collapsed inward. Although the damage was minor, the church remained closed until 1992 while restoration, as well as a bracing project to protect the building from future earthquakes, without changing the building's decorations, was carried out.  The university hired a team of contractors, structural engineers, architects, and conservation specialists to develop a renovation plan, which was paid for by a $10 million fundraising drive.  Many donations came from undergraduates, and the university's board of trustees approved the plan before its funding was in place because they recognized the church's importance to Stanford.<ref>Gregg, pp. 30\u201331</ref><ref name=\"quake\"/>\n\nIn this restoration, the entire crossing was strengthened by bracing it behind the dome and securing it to the superstructure of the building.<ref name=\"gregg-30\"/>  The restoration team evaluated every decoration in the church and made improvements and changes as necessary, in order to preserve the building's interior elements.  They also discovered that the crossing's four large arches were hollow; they also found remnants of the steel frame that supported the original clock tower within a 20\" void space in the church's arched walls.  They had to fill the void with more than 470 tonnes of concrete and several layers of reinforcing steel in order to improve the walls' stability, an accomplishment the Alliance called \"one of the most challenging retrofit feats implemented at Stanford\".<ref name=\"quake\"/>\n\nThe roofs, which had not been replaced since 1913, were rebuilt with plywood [[Diaphragm (structural system)|diaphragms]], 30,000 new red clay tiles were installed, and the stones from the decorative arches were reinserted.

David Charles Gardner offered a course in Biblical history and literature beginning in 1907, and by 1910, he was teaching [[New Testament Greek]] and Bible classes.  Gardner's successor, [[D. Elton Trueblood]], whose goal was the establishment of a non-denominational graduate school in religious studies at Stanford, taught classes about the [[philosophy of religion]].  In 1941 Trueblood's efforts to expand the study of religion resulted in the creation of a minor in religion, as well as twenty-one courses offered by him and four faculty members.  By 1960, the chaplains of Stanford Memorial Church no longer had to run the program, which had expanded to allow students the option of majoring in the study of religion.<ref>Harvey, pp. 4\u20136</ref>  By the mid-1960s, the religious studies program at Stanford was enjoying \"enormous success\".<ref>Harvey, p. 6</ref>\n\nIn the 1960s, the study of religion at Stanford began to focus more on social and ethical issues like race and the [[Vietnam War]].

Day]] to review and update the church's blueprints.  [[Charles E. Hodges]] was the supervising architect for the project.  Jane Stanford hired builder [[John McGilvray]], who was responsible for constructing the [[St. Francis Hotel]], the [[San Francisco City Hall|City Hall]] complex in San Francisco, and much of Stanford University, for the actual construction of Stanford Memorial Church.<ref name=\"history\"/>\n\n[[File:Memchu outerwindows.jpg|thumb|Details of the upper windows of the facade|alt=The upper windows of the facade are surrounded by rich carvings.]]\nJane Stanford's taste and knowledge of both contemporary and classical art is evident in several aspects of the plan, appearance, and architecture of the church, which \"dazzle the eye yet also produce an atmosphere of quiet contemplation\".<ref name=\"oberhausen-3\"/>  According to Joncas, \"the church emulates the 'glorious color' of the great European cathedrals\", especially those in Italy.<ref name=\"joncas-28\">Joncas, p. 28</ref>  Although the [[iconography]] in the church is Christian, Stanford was a \"late Victorian progressive\",<ref name=\"oberhausen-3\"/> and chose the art less for its religious themes and more for its \"humanitarian ethics\".<ref name=\"oberhausen-3\"/>  She requested that the designs include women, \"to show the uplifting influence of religion for women\";<ref name=\"hall-23\">Hall, p. 23</ref> Architectural historian Willis L. Hall claims that there are more depictions of women than in most church imagery at the time.<ref name=\"hall-23\"/>  Art historian Judy Oberhausen reports that Stanford used [[compendium]] of biblical illustrations like ''[[:commons:Category:Bible Pictures with brief descriptions by Charles Foster|The Story of the Bible]]'' by Charles Foster, which contained 300 illustrations and summarized the events and stories she wished to depict in the church's windows and mosaics.<ref name=\"oberhausen-3\"/>\n\nJane Stanford's design included inspirational messages placed throughout the church in the form of inscriptions carved into its walls and enclosed in carved frameworks.<ref>Hall, p. 39</ref>  As Barbara Palmer of the ''Stanford Report'' stated, Stanford \"had her religious beliefs literally carved into the church's sandstone walls\".<ref name=\"palmer\"/>  For example, the following quotations can be found in the church's east transept:<ref group=note>For a complete list of the inscriptions, see Hall pp. 39\u201345.</ref>\n\n<blockquote>Religion is intended as a comfort, a solace, a necessity to the soul's welfare; and whichever form of religion furnishes the greatest comfort, the greatest solace, it is the form which should be adopted be its name what it will.</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>The best form of religion is trust in God, and a firm belief in the immortality of the soul, life everlasting.<ref>Hall, p. 40</ref></blockquote>\n\n=== Plan ===\n[[File:Stanford Memorial Church Plan.jpg|thumb|'''A'''=Altar, '''B'''=Chancel, '''C'''=Crossing, '''D'''=Nave, '''E'''=Aisles, '''F'''=Vestibule, '''G'''=Arcade, '''H'''=East Transept with Transept Gallery above, '''J'''=West Transept/Side Chapel with Transept Gallery above, '''K'''=Round Room]]\n\nThe church is a [[cruciform]] structure; its original structure, which included a clock and bell tower with an 80-foot (24 m) spire, was {{convert|190|ft|m}} long and {{convert|150|ft|m}} wide.<ref name=\"history\"/>  The [[facade]] faces the Inner Quad, and is connected to other buildings by [[Arcade (architecture)|arcades]] which extend laterally.

High semicircular Romanesque arches separate the crossing from the nave, [[transept]]s and [[chancel]]. The chancel and transepts are [[apse|apsidal]]. There are deep galleries with concave [[Baluster|balustraded]] fronts in the transepts and an organ gallery above the narthex. The sanctuary, in the chancel, is elevated and approached by steps.

Gregg credits the high quality of the stonework to church and university builder John D. McGilvray.<ref name=\"gregg-22\">Gregg, p. 22</ref>  The church is roofed with terracotta tiles of the Italian [[imbrex and tegula]] form. The nave, chancel, and transepts appear to project from the square central structure, roofed with tiles and a small skylight above its center.  Memorial Church originally had a central bell tower with an 80-foot tall, twelve-sided spire, but this was lost as a result of the 1906 earthquake.<ref name=\"quake\"/>\n\nThe church's [[facade]] is surmounted by a simple [[Celtic cross]], a motif that appears several times throughout the building.<ref name=\"gregg-36\">Gregg, p. 36</ref>  The cross was added after the 1906 earthquake; its central shaft was destroyed in the Loma Prieta earthquake and replaced.<ref>Gregg, pp. 36\u201337</ref>  There are three arched entrances below the exterior mosaic; the central one is slightly larger than the others.<ref name=\"hall-17\"/>  The surrounding stonework is intricately carved with stylized flora, twisted-cable moldings, and bosses of sculpted cherubim, a motif which occurs in different media throughout the church. In the spandrels are mosaic depictions of the biblical concepts of love, faith, hope and charity intertwined in a vine representing the \"[[tree of life]]\".<ref name=\"hall-17\"/><ref group=note>Love is represented by a mother with wings encircling children.</ref>\n\nIn the upper zone of the facade, surrounded by more elaborate stonework and \"lacy carving\",<ref name=\"hall-17\"/> is a large central window, with groups of three smaller windows on each side.  The original central window was a quatrefoil-shaped [[rose window]], but after the 1906 earthquake, it was replaced by a \"classical round-head window that more grandly restates the smaller flanking, articulated openings\"<ref name=\"joncas-28\"/> and that corresponded with the [[Mission Revival Style architecture|mission-style architecture]] of the Quad.<ref name=\"gregg-26\"/>  Beneath the windows are inlaid panels of colored marble.\n\nThe gable and surrounding surfaces contain the church's largest mosaic, created by Maurizio Camerino's studio, which they rebuilt after the 1906 earthquake.<ref name=\"watercolors\"/>  Measuring {{convert|84|ft|m}} wide at the base and {{convert|30|ft|m}} in height, at the time of its completion, it was the largest mosaic in the U.S. It depicts a group of men, women and children, 47 in all, surrounding and \"paying close heed\"<ref name=\"hall-17\">Hall, p. 17</ref> to Christ, the mosaic's central figure, and includes a landscape with \"waving palms and a gleaming sky\"<ref name=\"hall-17\"/> behind Christ.   The exterior mosaic took 12 men two years to complete.<ref name=\"watercolors\"/>\n\nAfter Jane Stanford's death, the mosaic popularly gained the name \"[[The Sermon on the Mount]]\", although Stanford University historian Richard Joncas insists that the mosaic does not depict the scene as described in the [[Gospel of Matthew]] and has referred to it as \"an indefinite biblical scene\".<ref name=\"joncas-28\"/> In the Stanford University press release about the 1992 gift of three watercolor studies for the church's mosaics, Paoletti's design for the facade is described as ''\"Christ Welcoming the Righteous into the Kingdom of God\"'', based on Matthew 25:34.<ref name=\"watercolors\"/>  Paoletti created another unfinished watercolor depicting \"[[The Last Judgment]]\", as another option for the facade mosaic, but it was evidently rejected by Stanford.<ref name=\"palmer\"/>\n\n{{multiple image\n | align     = center\n| direction = horizontal\n| image1    = Memchu hopedetail.jpg\n| width1    = 156\n| alt1      = A carving of the head and wings of an angel: above the angel is the bottom of a mosaic with the label \"HOPE\" and a margin which has a head with flowering ivy.\n| caption1  = Detail of the foliate carvings around the doors\n| image2    = Exterior mosaic2.jpg\n| width2    = 310\n| alt2      = Jesus, with His arms stretched out, welcomes people who are coming towards him from both sides.

The doors open up into a [[narthex]] or [[Vestibule (architecture)|vestibule]] decorated with mosaics on the walls, illuminated by the many colors of the stained glass windows, and stone carvings on the architectural details.<ref name=\"hall-17\"/> There is a variety of styles and motifs reflecting the hands of different craftsmen.  The mosaic that adorns the floor depicts the [[Lamb of God]] surrounded by the symbols of the [[Four evangelists|four gospel writers]]: [[Matthew the Evangelist|St. Matthew]] (the winged angel), [[Mark the Evangelist|St. Mark]] (the winged lion), [[Luke the Evangelist|St. Luke]] (the ox), and [[John the Apostle|St. John]] (the eagle).  Some of these symbols also appear in other areas of the church.<ref name=\"gregg-38\">Gregg, p. 38</ref>  A Celtic cross adorns the stained glass above the central wooden door that leads into the nave, and Latin epigraphs have been engraved above the two side doors.<ref>Gregg, p. 39</ref><ref group=note>''Domus Dei Aula Coeli'' (\"The house of God, the forecourt of heaven\") above the right door; ''Domus Dei Locus Orationis'' (\"The house of God, the house of prayer\") above the left door.</ref>\n\nAbove the [[narthex]] is an organ gallery. The nave is [[Arcade (architecture)|arcaded]] and has a single aisle on each side with clerestory windows above. Its walls, from the floor to the top of the clerestory, are decorated with 15 murals made of mosaics on each side, and depicts scenes from the Old Testament.<ref name=\"history\"/>  The exposed timber ceiling was inspired by Trinity Church and is constructed with tied [[Hammer beam roof|hammer beams]], which can be seen radiating in the chancel.  The floor of the church slopes downward towards the crossing.  The chancel and transepts are three semi-circular apses.<ref name=\"joncas-28\"/> They are separated from the broad central space by large semi-circular arches on stout columns with carved capitals. The transept apses each have a balcony with a concave balustrade.\n\nDirectly above the crossing is a [[dome]] supported on pendentives.  Around the base of the dome are decorative gilt bands, the lower depicting a scrolling vine. Jane Stanford intended the dome's decoration of to be of mosaic tiles showing a variety of symbols, but the church's builders thought it would make the dome too heavy, so the decorations were painted.<ref>Gregg, pp. 53, 57</ref>  On the [[spandrels]] of the pendentives are mosaics of four angels measuring {{convert|42|ft|m}} from wing tip to wing tip, rising from clouds.  The angels survived the 1906 earthquake, but the angel looking downward was severely damaged during the 1989 earthquake because an 8-foot section of its left wing fell {{convert|70|ft|m}}.<ref>Gregg, p. 53</ref>\n\nThe [[chancel]], according to Hall, contains \"artistic work of a kind seldom seen anywhere\".<ref name=\"hall-17\"/>  The raised tiled floor of the chancel curves outward into the body of the church, and is approached by seven marble steps. The [[sanctuary]] is raised further, and enclosed by a marble altar rail behind which is an altar carved from white Carrara [[marble]] by [[L.M. Avenali]].  The altar supports a \"simple unadorned brass cross that reflects the colors of the mosaics surrounding it.\"<ref name=\"gregg-50\">Gregg, p. 50</ref>  The cross was made by [[William van Erp]] and was dedicated to the memory of Jane Stanford in 1948.\n\n[[File:Memchu altar pulpit.jpg|thumb|left|Wide view of the chancel in Stanford Memorial Church|alt=A view into the chancel is framed on the right by the lectern supported by a standing brass angel. The chancel is semi-circular and has a roof on wooden beams. The upper walls have brightly coloured mosaics of prophets and angels. The white marble altar and mosaic reredos of \"The Last Supper\" can be seen.]]\nBehind the altar is a mosaic reproduction of Rosselli's \"[[Last Supper (Rosselli)|Last Supper]]\".  Around the lower walls of the chancel are twelve niches decorated with golden mosaic tiles. They hold candles, but originally held statues of the twelve apostles, destroyed in 1906 and were never replaced. According to local legend, the cherubim carved in stone above the golden niches and in the pillars' capitals are illustrations of children living on campus at the time of the church's construction.<ref name=\"gregg-50\"/>  To the west side of the chancel stands brass lectern in the form of a reading angel, which Jane Stanford brought from Europe and dedicated to her husband on the anniversary of his birth in 1902.<ref>Gregg, p. 46</ref>\n\nThree stained glass windows in the apse depict the [[Nativity of Jesus|nativity]], [[crucifixion]], and [[Ascension of Jesus|ascension]] of Christ.  The mosaics between them show angels, those on the left carrying a cross, those on the right carrying a crown. On the longer sections of the chancel wall, on either side of the windows, are mosaics depicting a choir of angels. Above them is a tier of mosaics with representations of the prophets and kings of Israel. Other mosaics abound in the transepts, clerestory, and the choir loft at the northern end of the church.  A series of mosaics in the upper transepts depict Old Testament figures on the east side and Christian saints on the west side. On Jane Stanford's direction, they alternate male and female.<ref name=\"gregg-57\"/>\n\nThe arches, balcony rails, and pillars throughout the church have relief carvings created by a team of 10 men who worked for two years from [[scaffolding]].<ref>Gregg, p. 58</ref>  A large double pillar before the entrance of the west transept have inscriptions dedicated to members of the Stanford family.  After the 1989 earthquake, a third of the west transept was converted into a small chapel.  The altar and chairs in this chapel were designed by Bay Area artist [[Gail Fredell]] who decorated the chapel's altar by using Salvatti's original mosaics, which had been stored since the church's reconstruction following the 1906 earthquake.<ref>Gregg, pp. 42, 45</ref>\n\n==== Windows ====\n[[File:Stanfordchurch-ascension.jpg|thumb|A window in the nave shows Christ welcoming a soul into Heaven, a reference to the death of Leland Stanford, Jr.|alt=This stained-glass window shows two angels carrying a small child up towards Christ seated on golden clouds in while a group of people below are watching.]]\n\nAccording to architectural historian Willis L. Hall, the church's 20 large [[stained glass windows]] \"are as much a feature of the church as the mosaics\".<ref name=\"hall-35\"/>  The windows, designed by Frederick Stymetz Lamb (1863\u20131928) and fabricated by J&R Lamb Studios, his father's firm in New York City, took three years to complete,<ref name=\"glass\"/> and eight months to install at Stanford.<ref>Gregg, p. 60</ref>  Jane Stanford hired Lamb because she felt he was more interested in \"the ecclesiastical rather than commercial aspect of the work\".<ref>Gregg, p. 21</ref>  The installation of the windows at Stanford Memorial Church was the largest commission awarded to an American stained glass artist at the time, and the project is \"considered the finest example of Lamb's work\".<ref name=\"gregg-22\"/>  The window have a different appearance when viewed from the outside of the building because the reflected light highlights the textures of the glass panels, created by using many layers of different colored glass.<ref>Gregg, p. 62</ref>\n\nStanford chose the life of Christ for the windows' theme, inspired by the religious paintings by European master painters such as [[Frederic Shields]] and [[Gustave Dor\u00e9]].  The windows have a section at the bottom with the scriptural quotations their images depict; the larger windows also include their titles.<ref name=\"hall-35\"/>  Stanford's personal touch is shown in one of the [[nave]] windows, which is based on a cartoon by Paoletti and depicts Christ welcoming the soul of a child into Heaven before the eyes of its grieving mother, an allusion to the death of [[Leland Stanford, Jr.]],<ref name=\"glass\"/> the Stanfords' only child and the university's namesake, who died in 1884 of [[typhoid]] shortly before his 16th birthday.\n\nOberhausen, who has studied the source of the mosaics and windows, states that at least four stained glass windows were inspired by the paintings of Pre-Raphaelite artists that were enjoying a resurgence in popularity at the time.  These windows are: \"Christ in the Temple\" in the east transept, based upon a painting by [[William Holman Hunt]]; \"The Annunciation\" in the east nave, inspired by a work by [[Frederic Shields]]; \"The Nativity\" in the chancel, based upon a painting by [[Edward Fellowes-Prynne]]; and \"The Good Shepherd\" in the west transept, inspired by a painting by Sibyl C. Parker, the only female artist represented in the artwork of the church.<ref name=\"oberhausen-3\"/>  None of the windows of Stanford Memorial Church required replacement after the 1906 quake, except for \"the famous rose window of the original structure\" in the organ loft which was replaced by the current large, central arch window.<ref name=\"hall-35\"/>  This window, entitled \"Lilies of the Field\", is the only window in the church that cannot be viewed from the inside because it is blocked off by the central organ.<ref name=\"gregg-37\"/>  There is a cross in the center of this window made of \"faceted pieces of glass that are inset like gems\",<ref name=\"gregg-37\">Gregg, p. 37</ref> which sparkle when light strikes it.\n\nThe church's clerestory contains many smaller windows of individuals from the Bible or Christian history.  The windows in the nave above the east arcade depict the following Old Testament figures: [[Abraham]], [[Hagar (Bible)|Hagar]] and her child [[Ishmael]], [[Moses]], [[Bithiah|Pharaoh's Daughter]], [[Joshua]], and [[Deborah]].  The windows in the east transept depict [[David]], [[Book of Ruth|Ruth]], [[Solomon]], [[The Queen of Sheba]], [[Elijah]], [[Esther]], [[Isaiah]], [[Judith]], [[Daniel (biblical figure)|Daniel]], and [[Hannah (Bible)|Hannah]].  In the nave above the west arcade feature saints and virtues: [[Saint Stephen|Stephen]], [[Agnes of Rome|Agnes]], [[Saint Peter|Peter]], [[Priscilla and Aquila|Priscilla]], [[John the Apostle|John]], and [[Hope]].  In the west transept are [[Simeon (Gospel of Luke)|Simeon]], [[Saint Anne|Anne]], [[Matthew the Evangelist|Matthew]], [[Faith]], [[Mark the Evangelist|Mark]], [[Charity (virtue)|Charity]], [[Luke the Evangelist|Luke]], [[Dorcas]], [[Saint Paul|Paul]], and [[Martha of Bethany|Martha]].

One of the reasons she chose mosaics was because of the similar weather in Italy and Northern California, where the moderate climates and rainy seasons in both settings protect the images from erosion and clear the pollution that accumulates on many buildings in large cities.  As Hall states, the \"mosaics on the facade are always clear and brilliant.\"<ref>Hall, p. 19</ref>  During the Stanfords' 1883 tour of Europe, they visited [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine churches]] in [[Constantinople]] and [[St Mark's Basilica]] in Venice.  They met and befriended Maurizio Camerino, the manager of the [[Antonio Salviati]] studios, which had just completed restoring the mosaics at St Mark's.<ref name=\"watercolors\"/>\n\nStanford began working with Camerino, who by that time had bought the Salviati studios, in 1899, and spent two months in Venice in the fall of 1900, selecting the watercolors created as the mosaics' patterns by Camerino's chief designer, Antonio Paoletti.<ref name=\"gregg-18\"/><ref name=\"palmer\">{{cite news | last = Palmer | first = Barbara | title = Mosaic Exhibit Shows Rejected Design for Memorial Church | work = Stanford Report | url = http://news.stanford.edu/news/2004/february25/mosaic-225.html | date = 23 February 2004 | accessdate = 27 August 2017}}</ref>{{refn|group=note|In 1992, Camerino's family, in honor of the friendship between the Camerino and Stanford families, donated three watercolor studies of the Memorial Church mosaics, painted by Paoletti, to Stanford University.

The character was created by writer [[Warren Ellis]] and artist [[Bryan Hitch]]. The character made his first appearance in ''[[Stormwatch (comics)|Stormwatch]]'' (vol. 2) #4, titled \"A Finer World (Part 1 of 3)\" (February 1998).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Cowsill |first1=Alan |last2=Irvine |first2=Alex |last3=Korte |first3=Steve |last4=Manning |first4=Matt |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |last6=Wilson |first6=Sven |title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia: The Definitive Guide to the Characters of the DC Universe |date=2016 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-5357-0 |page=202}}</ref> He went on to appear in various ''Authority'' books and other series, as well as his own eponymous ongoing series.\n\nMidnighter is best known as a member of the rogue superhero team [[The Authority (comics)|the Authority]].

Malloy, Warren Ellis described Midnighter as \"The Shadow by way of John Woo\". Midnighter is rarely seen without his costume and mask.<ref>One instance was in his first appearance, in ''Stormwatch'' (vol. 2) #4.</ref> Recurring themes in Midnighter's adventures are his love of violence and killing, as well as comments on his sexuality.\n\n==Publication history==\n\n{{Empty section|date=December 2018}}\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n===''Stormwatch''===\nWarren Ellis created and introduced the character in 1998, soon after his appointment as writer on the ''[[Stormwatch (comics)|Stormwatch]]'' title. ''Stormwatch'' vol. 2 #4 introduced Midnighter and Apollo as former Stormwatch agents from a secret \"black ops\" team known only to the first Weatherman, [[Henry Bendix]]. In the first issue of the arc, collected in trade paperback as '''''A Finer World''''', Christine Trelane had cracked the files of the recently deposed Bendix and discovered Apollo and Midnighter's existence. The new Weatherman, Jackson King, intercepted them on a mission to seize weapons made in the \"Nevada Garden\", a bioengineering facility created by the first [[Engineer (comics)|Engineer]]. Flashback sequences showed Midnighter and Apollo, the sole survivors of their seven-member team's sinister first mission, escaping Bendix and going rogue to spend five years fighting crime on the streets of America. Midnighter and Apollo initially resisted their capture, believing Stormwatch still to be under Bendix's command; on learning of his death, they ended their opposition and accepted a mission from King to destroy the Nevada Garden. To repay their assistance, Trelane granted Midnighter and Apollo new civilian identities and lives away from Stormwatch. This story arc introduced Midnighter's trademark enhancements, his superpowered healing and ability to anticipate an opponent's moves so quickly as to win any fight, as being the product of bioengineering commissioned by Bendix.\n\n===''The Authority''===\nIn 1999 Warren Ellis concluded his run on ''Stormwatch'' with the '''Final Orbit''' storyline, which saw the team destroyed. Midnighter was one of several Stormwatch characters Ellis retained for his new Wildstorm title, ''The Authority''. In it, Midnighter (along with Apollo) was recruited by [[Jenny Sparks]] for a new team, [[The Authority (comics)|the Authority]], under her leadership. The new series picked up themes Ellis had explored in ''Stormwatch'', including the political potential of a team more powerful than world governments and the [[United Nations]].\n\nA formidable fighter with a sardonic attitude, Midnighter epitomised the new team's commitment to fighting for a finer world, including against vested interests and world governments. Midnighter and Apollo's relationship, though hinted in previous issues, was revealed in ''The Authority'' #8. Midnighter was the architect of the team's first significant victory, the defeat of autocratic dictator Kaizen Gamorra, which he achieved by dropping the 50-mile-long Carrier onto Gamorra's island base.\n\nDuring the ''[[The Authority (comics)|Transfer of Power]]'' storyline, Midnighter was the only Authority member to evade capture when the U.S. government had the team attacked and replaced with manipulable substitutes. Presumed dead, Midnighter had in fact escaped the Carrier with baby Jenny Quantum. He returned to overthrow the puppet team and rescue Apollo from imprisonment and abuse at the hands of their replacements. Shortly thereafter Midnighter and Apollo were married and adopted Jenny.\n\nMidnighter had a central role in [[Ed Brubaker]] and [[Dustin Nguyen (artist)|Dustin Nguyen]]'s ''[[The Authority (comics)|Revolution]]'' maxiseries. A visitation, apparently from a future Apollo, convinced Midnighter that he was on the path to becoming a malign dictator. To avoid this fate, Midnighter quit the team, precipitating its break-up, and returned to life fighting solo on the streets. Raised alone by Apollo, Jenny exploited her powers to age herself to young adulthood and reformed the Authority. Having convinced Midnighter to rejoin the team, Jenny discovered he was being manipulated by a dimension-hopping Henry Bendix, hitherto assumed dead. Midnighter fought for Bendix before the Engineer was able to break the mind-control; Midnighter then killed Bendix by ripping out his spine.\n\n===''Kev''===\nMidnighter featured in the first three of [[Garth Ennis]]'s ''Kev'' miniseries, featuring [[Kev Hawkins]], a former [[Special Air Service|SAS]] soldier. Kev was introduced in the semi-parody ''The Authority: Kev'', in which he killed Midnighter, Apollo and the rest of the Authority, though the Carrier resurrected them. On their last meeting they took down MI5's Royal Oak project, an attempt to replicate Bendix's experiments. Kev later featured without the Authority in the final book of his series, ''A Man Called Kev''.\n\n===''Midnighter'' (2000s series)===\n{{See also|Midnighter (2006 comic book)}}\n[[File:MDNTR-Cv1_solicit.png|thumb|left|Cover of ''Midnighter'' #1 (November 2006). Art by [[Chris Sprouse]] and [[Karl Story]].|170px]]\nOn 1 November 2006, an ongoing ''Midnighter'' solo series began, with an initial creative partnership of [[Garth Ennis]] and [[Chris Sprouse]]. The book was part of the 2006 \"Worldstorm\" soft reboot of the Wildstorm universe, which saw several books relaunched, but which faltered when flagship titles  ''The Authority'' and ''WildC.A.T.S.'' suffered serious delays and were cancelled after two and one issues respectively.<ref name=\"io9\">{{cite web|title=When Superheroes Fail To Save The World|url=http://io9.com/5037854/when-superheroes-fail-to-save-the-world|work=io9|publisher=Gawker Media|accessdate=24 September 2012|author=Graeme McMillan|date=17 August 2008}}</ref> The series was originally intended as a six-issue miniseries<ref name=\"MMCS\">{{cite book|last=Dezago|first=Todd |author2=Eric Nolen-Weathington|title=Modern Masters Volume Twenty-one: Chris Sprouse|publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing|date=June 2009|volume=21|page=73}}</ref> but ran for 20 issues and was cancelled in June 2008.\n\nThe first story arc saw Midnighter attacked and kidnapped by agents of a man named Paulus while passing through the Carrier's [[teleportation]] portal. Paulus told Midnighter that he had replaced Midnighter's secondary heart with a remote-detonated bomb, and challenged him on pain of death to assassinate [[Adolf Hitler]].\nTime-travelling back to the [[First World War]] trenches, Midnighter encountered Hitler as a young corporal in the German army, but was apprehended by 'time police' officers from the 95th century before carrying out his mission. In his struggle to escape, he crashed the officers' time machine at the year 1945, shortly before Hitler's expected suicide. Eventually Midnighter allied himself with the police and returned to his own time, where he threatened to erase Paulus from history by killing his kidnapped younger self; he secured Paulus's surrender without having to kill the child. Midnighter then returned to the Carrier, but was apparently just as listless as before, immediately sending himself on another mission in [[Iraq]].\n\nThis first arc was followed by four single-issue stories. ''Midnighter'' #6 featured an apparent alternate-universe Samurai Midnighter. ''Midnighter'' #7, by [[Brian K. Vaughan]] and [[Darick Robertson]], explored the way Midnighter's brain processes combat by running the story backwards. ''Midnighter'' #8, by [[Christos Gage]] and [[John Paul Leon]], dealt with Midnighter's attempts to connect better with humans after a graphic and public battle with the ''Suicide King''.\n\nA second story arc (issues #10\u201316), under new creative team [[Keith Giffen]] and [[Jon Landry (writer)|Jon Landry]] (with [[ChrisCross]] pencilling later issues), detailed Midnighter's attempts to rediscover his life before becoming superhuman. Files given to him by Jenny Quantum identified him as Lucas Trent, born 14 July 1967 (making him 40 years old in 2007), a native of [[Harmony, Indiana]]. On visiting the town he found it was the hub of a paramilitary patriotic organisation named Anthem, with ambitions to take over the United States and provide the country with the conscience they felt it had lost. While battling Anthem and its superpowered operatives, including Dawn (a reference to the phrase \"dawn's early light\" in \"[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]\"), and Rosie (patterned after [[Rosie the Riveter]]), he discovered that Jenny had falsified the documents she gave him, and that he had never been Trent \u2013 but decided to stay on in Harmony nonetheless.\n\nThe final storyline, again by Giffen, featured a Midnighter imposter attacking the Carrier and the Authority, and Midnighter's, fight to defeat him.\n\n===''Grifter & Midnighter''===\nThe 2007 mini-series, ''Grifter & Midnighter'', united [[Grifter (comics)|Grifter]], of [[WildC.A.T.s]], with Midnighter. The series was written by [[Chuck Dixon]], with art by [[Ryan Benjamin (comics)|Ryan Benjamin]] and inking by Saleem Crawford.<ref>{{cite web|title=Emma And Grifter And Midnighter|url=http://www.bleedingcool.com/2012/03/12/emma-and-grifter-and-midnighter/|work=Bleeding Cool|publisher=BleedingCool.com|accessdate=24 September 2012|author=Rich Johnston|date=12 March 2012}}</ref>\n\n===''World's End''===\nThe 2008 ''[[Number of the Beast (comics)|Number of the Beast]]'' Wildstorm limited series described the devastation of Earth, and set the scene for a new Authority ongoing series, by [[Dan Abnett]] and [[Andy Lanning]], part of the ''[[World's End (comics)|World's End]]'' storyline. In this series Midnighter appears as one of the last Authority members still able to act in the ruins of London, now called Unlondon. Separated from Apollo, who is confined to the upper atmosphere by sunlight-blocking fog over the planet's surface, Midnighter helps civilians to reach the ruins of the Carrier, now a stronghold for survivors. Midnighter is able to contact Apollo via balloons which he releases high up in the atmosphere.\n\nFollowing the resolution of the ''World's End'' storyline, the Authority's Carrier is called back to its creators. Jack Hawksmoor, Swift, and the Engineer go with it, but Midnighter remains on Earth to be with Apollo, who needs to be close to the sun.\n\n===''The New 52'': ''Stormwatch'', ''Grayson'' and ''Midnighter'' (2011-2016)===\n{{See also|Midnighter (2015 comic book)}}\nIn the autumn of 2011, DC relaunched its production with 52 new titles, including ''Stormwatch'' (written by [[Paul Cornell]] and drawn by Miguel Sepulveda). Cornell's ''Stormwatch'' #1 debuted a radically new version of the team, which lasted until spring 2013. Featuring longtime DC character [[Martian Manhunter]] and a number of new creations, Stormwatch was posited as a modern-day version of DC's [[Demon Knights]], and Midnighter and Apollo were introduced at the start of their careers, unaware of one another's sexualities and their mutual attraction to one another. The first issue depicts the group's attempt at recruiting Midnighter and Apollo. Lucas Trent was presented for the first time as Midnighter's actual name and his costume was redesigned drastically.<ref>''Stormwatch'' (vol. 3) #1 (September 2011)</ref> When Harry Tanner (who at the time was disguised as one of the Shadow Lords) framed Midnighter, he escaped, taking the Projectionist along with him. Eventually, when the team managed to capture him, Harry's ruse was revealed and Midnighter's innocence was proven. After the Engineer, who had been slowly losing her humanity, attacked them, Midnighter managed to escape with Apollo and with the help of his ally Zealot, attacked the base. After Jenny destroyed the base and killed the Engineer, the team mostly disassembled and Midnighter and Apollo realized that they had feelings for one another. For [[Jim Starlin]]'s run on the title with issue #19, a time travel incident returned Midnighter and Apollo to their original designs and status as long-time lovers, before the ''New 52'''s status quo for the characters was restored in the final issue.\n\nDuring the summer of 2014 he is regularly featured in the comic book series ''Grayson'' as he works to stop Spyral in collecting the body parts of a dead villain which endows those who have them the powers of the Justice League.\n\nThe character began appearing in his own ongoing [[DC Comics]] series in June 2015, written by [[Steve Orlando]]. In it, Midnighter, having broken up with Apollo, has to come to terms with being newly single, as well as tracking down a thief who stole exotic technology from the God Garden and is openly selling it to different individuals. Amongst the items stolen are files containing the origin of who Midnighter really was before the Gardener abducted and created him. After teaming up with Spyral agent Dick Grayson to track down Russian vampire thrill-killers, Midnighter accompanies his new boyfriend to the latter's hometown to track down those who attacked his father and encounters the mastermind behind the theft of the God Garden technology-[[Prometheus (DC Comics)|Prometheus]].\n\n===''DC Rebirth'': ''Midnighter and Apollo'' (2016-2017)===\n{{See also|Midnighter and Apollo}}\nThe character appears again along with his former boyfriend, [[Apollo (comics)|Apollo]] for a six-issue miniseries titled ''[[Midnighter and Apollo]]'', continuing in the ''[[The New 52|New 52]]'' canon, where the two of them have gotten back together as a couple. Apollo is attacked and his soul trapped in a [[Hell (DC Comics)|hell]] dimension, and Midnighter plans to rescue him. He learns by [[Extra\u00f1o]] where Apollo is trapped. He then goes in search of the Ace of Winchesters, killing a demon called Vodyanar to get one bullet and then going into Hell to take the Ace from the Lords of the Gun.\n\nMidnighter is also referenced in the newly renumbered ''Detective Comics'' as a Batman Family ally; it is mentioned that Nightwing reaches out to him to access Door technology.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Tynion IV|first1=James|title=Detective Comics #940|date=2016|publisher=DC Comics}}</ref> This implies that they have maintained their professional friendship from ''Grayson'' and the ''DCYou'' ''Midnighter'' series.\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nMidnighter's abilities are presented in the character's first appearance, occurring in ''Stormwatch'' (vol. 2 #4). Midnighter is the product of [[Biological engineering|bioengineered]] enhancements commissioned by the character of Henry Bendix. It is implied (as in the ''Midnighter'' solo series (issues #10\u201316)) that Midnighter was a normal human before enlisting with Stormwatch Black. Several [[Plot (narrative)|storylines]] have featured the deactivation,<ref>Micah Ian Wright, ''Stormwatch: Team Achilles'', 2004</ref> over-riding,<ref>Ed Brubaker, ''The Authority: Revolution'' volume 2, 2006</ref> or removal<ref>[[Mark Millar]], ''The Authority: Transfer of Power'' 2002; Garth Ennis, ''Midnighter'' issue #1, 2007</ref> of the character's [[Human enhancement|enhancements]] to reduce Midnighter's abilities to those of a normal man. The abortive ''Team Achilles'' series suggested that Bendix had \"designed\" Midnighter and Apollo during his childhood.\n\nTypically, Midnighter is presented with [[superhuman strength]], speed, reflexes and [[Endurance|resilience]]. The character is shown moving faster than both the human and superhuman eye, and in possession of a healing factor that allows him to rapidly recover from injury and illness. Storylines have shown Midnighter surviving a broken neck, broken limbs, holes through his chest and burning; the character is also portrayed clearing \"AIDS in six weeks\". Midnighter is capable of surviving in anaerobic environments for short time periods and possesses a secondary replacement heart. He also has the power to suppress pain so he can keep fighting when pain would stop a normal person.\n\nMany writers have referenced Midnighter's trademark ability to predict the unfolding of a battle before it starts. Early in Ellis's run on ''The Authority'', the character was described as having a mental combat computer, with neural-inductive implants, which he uses to run through a given combat situation millions of times in his mind, almost instantly covering nearly every possible result before the first punch is even thrown. This allows for the perfect response and counterattack, such that if Midnighter can possibly win a battle, he will. Ellis portrayed the Midnighter delivering a monologue on this ability to intimidate opponents; Keith Giffen later had the character distribute a business card to this effect, to save time. Howard Link of Stormwatch describes such an ingenious ability design as Neurotactical Wetware.<ref>''Stormwatch: Post Human/Earth Division'' (vol. 1) #18 (March 1st 2009)</ref> Issue #7 of the ''Midnighter'' solo series, written by Brian K. Vaughan, showed the character using this ability regressively, to visualize the desired outcome of a battle and work backwards logically to achieve it. The stand-alone ''Authority'' graphic novel ''Human on the Inside'', by John Ridley, suggested the ability was reactive, and required an opponent to make a first move to define the possibilities for a response. Though this is contradicted by numerous earlier, and later comics. Midnighter was also unable to use this ability against the [[Joker (character)|Joker]] due to the latter's extreme insanity, implying that Midnighter's ability to predict attacks in opponents with unpredictable nature are useless.\n\nIn ''The New 52'', Midnighter's ability are slightly different. His power to predict the outcome of any situation still exists, but appears to have been supplemented by a form of precognition as well as enhanced knowledge. He is able to finish other people's sentences before they have thought about it, and when Stormwatch's map of alien threats to Earth materialised in front of him and Apollo, he instantly knew what it was. He has significant resistance to telepathic attacks, as he was able to resist the Scourge of Worlds' attempt to use the Martian Manhunter's telepathy on him. He mentions that he has carbon-fibre muscles that presumably enhance his strength. Harry Tanner, reputed to be the world's greatest swordsman, struggled to land even a single blow on Midnighter since the latter could predict every move he would make. After a few seconds of fighting, Midnighter immediately knew what Harry's power was. He has demonstrated the ability to move so stealthily that the Manhunter and Hawksmoor could not hear or sense his stalking them until it was too late. His suit enhances his durability; he was able to survive unaided in hyperspace for a while.\n\n==Alternate versions==\n* In ''Wildstorm Winter Special 2005'', a story called ''Apollo & Midnighter: Two Dangerous Ideas'' features their alternate reality analogues, '''Pluto''' and '''Daylighter''', with inverted color schemes to match. At first the real Apollo and Midnighter believed that they were their [[homophobia|homophobic]] counterparts, but later learned that they were a former couple and had broken up.\n* Issue #6 of Midnighter's solo series starred a nameless, super-skilled swordsman from feudal Japan who fell in love with a peace-seeking Chinese warrior much like Apollo. This swordsman had powers similar to Midnighter's future-sight and super-strength.\n* In ''[[Gen\u00b9\u00b3]]'' (volume 4) #11, a teenage version of Midnighter is a part of a team called \"[[The Authority (comics)|the Authori-teens]]\" named '''Daybreaker'''. While he and the Apollo analogue '''Kid Apollo''' would not appear to be openly gay, their feelings for one another are apparent; Kid Apollo is said to be \"overly protective\" of Daybreaker.\n* An alternate version of Midnighter (and the rest of the Authority) appeared in the \"Ruling the World\" ''Authority/[[Planetary (comics)|Planetary]]'' crossover.\n\n==Reception==\nIn 2013, [[ComicsAlliance]] ranked Midnighter as #17 on their list of the \"50 Sexiest Male Characters in Comics\".<ref>{{cite web|last=Wheeler |first=Andrew |url=http://comicsalliance.com/comics-sexiest-male-characters |title=ComicsAlliance Presents The 50 Sexiest Male Characters in Comics |publisher=[[ComicsAlliance]] |date=2013-02-14 |accessdate=2015-07-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151018024021/http://comicsalliance.com/comics-sexiest-male-characters |archivedate=18 October 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> In 2015, [[IGN]] listed Midnighter (along with Apollo) on their list of \"18 Awesome LGBT Characters\".<ref>{{cite web|last1=Yehl|first1=Joshua|title=18 Awesome LGBT Characters|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/06/30/18-awesome-lgbt-characters?page=3|website=[[IGN]]|accessdate=27 February 2017|date=30 June 2015}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[LGBT themes in comics]]\n\n==Collected editions==\n''Midnighter'' solo series:\n\n#''Midnighter: Killing Machine'' (collects ''Midnighter'' #1\u20136;

Malloy, Warren Ellis described Midnighter as \"The Shadow by way of John Woo\". Midnighter is rarely seen without his costume and mask.<ref>One instance was in his first appearance, in ''Stormwatch'' (vol. 2) #4.</ref> Recurring themes in Midnighter's adventures are his love of violence and killing, as well as comments on his sexuality.\n\n==Publication history==\n\n{{Empty section|date=December 2018}}\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n===''Stormwatch''===\nWarren Ellis created and introduced the character in 1998, soon after his appointment as writer on the ''[[Stormwatch (comics)|Stormwatch]]'' title. ''Stormwatch'' vol. 2 #4 introduced Midnighter and Apollo as former Stormwatch agents from a secret \"black ops\" team known only to the first Weatherman, [[Henry Bendix]]. In the first issue of the arc, collected in trade paperback as '''''A Finer World''''', Christine Trelane had cracked the files of the recently deposed Bendix and discovered Apollo and Midnighter's existence. The new Weatherman, Jackson King, intercepted them on a mission to seize weapons made in the \"Nevada Garden\", a bioengineering facility created by the first [[Engineer (comics)|Engineer]]. Flashback sequences showed Midnighter and Apollo, the sole survivors of their seven-member team's sinister first mission, escaping Bendix and going rogue to spend five years fighting crime on the streets of America. Midnighter and Apollo initially resisted their capture, believing Stormwatch still to be under Bendix's command; on learning of his death, they ended their opposition and accepted a mission from King to destroy the Nevada Garden. To repay their assistance, Trelane granted Midnighter and Apollo new civilian identities and lives away from Stormwatch. This story arc introduced Midnighter's trademark enhancements, his superpowered healing and ability to anticipate an opponent's moves so quickly as to win any fight, as being the product of bioengineering commissioned by Bendix.\n\n===''The Authority''===\nIn 1999 Warren Ellis concluded his run on ''Stormwatch'' with the '''Final Orbit''' storyline, which saw the team destroyed. Midnighter was one of several Stormwatch characters Ellis retained for his new Wildstorm title, ''The Authority''. In it, Midnighter (along with Apollo) was recruited by [[Jenny Sparks]] for a new team, [[The Authority (comics)|the Authority]], under her leadership. The new series picked up themes Ellis had explored in ''Stormwatch'', including the political potential of a team more powerful than world governments and the [[United Nations]].\n\nA formidable fighter with a sardonic attitude, Midnighter epitomised the new team's commitment to fighting for a finer world, including against vested interests and world governments. Midnighter and Apollo's relationship, though hinted in previous issues, was revealed in ''The Authority'' #8. Midnighter was the architect of the team's first significant victory, the defeat of autocratic dictator Kaizen Gamorra, which he achieved by dropping the 50-mile-long Carrier onto Gamorra's island base.\n\nDuring the ''[[The Authority (comics)|Transfer of Power]]'' storyline, Midnighter was the only Authority member to evade capture when the U.S. government had the team attacked and replaced with manipulable substitutes. Presumed dead, Midnighter had in fact escaped the Carrier with baby Jenny Quantum. He returned to overthrow the puppet team and rescue Apollo from imprisonment and abuse at the hands of their replacements. Shortly thereafter Midnighter and Apollo were married and adopted Jenny.\n\nMidnighter had a central role in [[Ed Brubaker]] and [[Dustin Nguyen (artist)|Dustin Nguyen]]'s ''[[The Authority (comics)|Revolution]]'' maxiseries. A visitation, apparently from a future Apollo, convinced Midnighter that he was on the path to becoming a malign dictator. To avoid this fate, Midnighter quit the team, precipitating its break-up, and returned to life fighting solo on the streets. Raised alone by Apollo, Jenny exploited her powers to age herself to young adulthood and reformed the Authority. Having convinced Midnighter to rejoin the team, Jenny discovered he was being manipulated by a dimension-hopping Henry Bendix, hitherto assumed dead. Midnighter fought for Bendix before the Engineer was able to break the mind-control; Midnighter then killed Bendix by ripping out his spine.\n\n===''Kev''===\nMidnighter featured in the first three of [[Garth Ennis]]'s ''Kev'' miniseries, featuring [[Kev Hawkins]], a former [[Special Air Service|SAS]] soldier. Kev was introduced in the semi-parody ''The Authority: Kev'', in which he killed Midnighter, Apollo and the rest of the Authority, though the Carrier resurrected them. On their last meeting they took down MI5's Royal Oak project, an attempt to replicate Bendix's experiments. Kev later featured without the Authority in the final book of his series, ''A Man Called Kev''.\n\n===''Midnighter'' (2000s series)===\n{{See also|Midnighter (2006 comic book)}}\n[[File:MDNTR-Cv1_solicit.png|thumb|left|Cover of ''Midnighter'' #1 (November 2006). Art by [[Chris Sprouse]] and [[Karl Story]].|170px]]\nOn 1 November 2006, an ongoing ''Midnighter'' solo series began, with an initial creative partnership of [[Garth Ennis]] and [[Chris Sprouse]]. The book was part of the 2006 \"Worldstorm\" soft reboot of the Wildstorm universe, which saw several books relaunched, but which faltered when flagship titles  ''The Authority'' and ''WildC.A.T.S.'' suffered serious delays and were cancelled after two and one issues respectively.<ref name=\"io9\">{{cite web|title=When Superheroes Fail To Save The World|url=http://io9.com/5037854/when-superheroes-fail-to-save-the-world|work=io9|publisher=Gawker Media|accessdate=24 September 2012|author=Graeme McMillan|date=17 August 2008}}</ref> The series was originally intended as a six-issue miniseries<ref name=\"MMCS\">{{cite book|last=Dezago|first=Todd |author2=Eric Nolen-Weathington|title=Modern Masters Volume Twenty-one: Chris Sprouse|publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing|date=June 2009|volume=21|page=73}}</ref> but ran for 20 issues and was cancelled in June 2008.\n\nThe first story arc saw Midnighter attacked and kidnapped by agents of a man named Paulus while passing through the Carrier's [[teleportation]] portal. Paulus told Midnighter that he had replaced Midnighter's secondary heart with a remote-detonated bomb, and challenged him on pain of death to assassinate [[Adolf Hitler]].\nTime-travelling back to the [[First World War]] trenches, Midnighter encountered Hitler as a young corporal in the German army, but was apprehended by 'time police' officers from the 95th century before carrying out his mission. In his struggle to escape, he crashed the officers' time machine at the year 1945, shortly before Hitler's expected suicide. Eventually Midnighter allied himself with the police and returned to his own time, where he threatened to erase Paulus from history by killing his kidnapped younger self; he secured Paulus's surrender without having to kill the child. Midnighter then returned to the Carrier, but was apparently just as listless as before, immediately sending himself on another mission in [[Iraq]].\n\nThis first arc was followed by four single-issue stories. ''Midnighter'' #6 featured an apparent alternate-universe Samurai Midnighter. ''Midnighter'' #7, by [[Brian K. Vaughan]] and [[Darick Robertson]], explored the way Midnighter's brain processes combat by running the story backwards. ''Midnighter'' #8, by [[Christos Gage]] and [[John Paul Leon]], dealt with Midnighter's attempts to connect better with humans after a graphic and public battle with the ''Suicide King''.\n\nA second story arc (issues #10\u201316), under new creative team [[Keith Giffen]] and [[Jon Landry (writer)|Jon Landry]] (with [[ChrisCross]] pencilling later issues), detailed Midnighter's attempts to rediscover his life before becoming superhuman. Files given to him by Jenny Quantum identified him as Lucas Trent, born 14 July 1967 (making him 40 years old in 2007), a native of [[Harmony, Indiana]]. On visiting the town he found it was the hub of a paramilitary patriotic organisation named Anthem, with ambitions to take over the United States and provide the country with the conscience they felt it had lost. While battling Anthem and its superpowered operatives, including Dawn (a reference to the phrase \"dawn's early light\" in \"[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]\"), and Rosie (patterned after [[Rosie the Riveter]]), he discovered that Jenny had falsified the documents she gave him, and that he had never been Trent \u2013 but decided to stay on in Harmony nonetheless.\n\nThe final storyline, again by Giffen, featured a Midnighter imposter attacking the Carrier and the Authority, and Midnighter's, fight to defeat him.\n\n===''Grifter & Midnighter''===\nThe 2007 mini-series, ''Grifter & Midnighter'', united [[Grifter (comics)|Grifter]], of [[WildC.A.T.s]], with Midnighter. The series was written by [[Chuck Dixon]], with art by [[Ryan Benjamin (comics)|Ryan Benjamin]] and inking by Saleem Crawford.<ref>{{cite web|title=Emma And Grifter And Midnighter|url=http://www.bleedingcool.com/2012/03/12/emma-and-grifter-and-midnighter/|work=Bleeding Cool|publisher=BleedingCool.com|accessdate=24 September 2012|author=Rich Johnston|date=12 March 2012}}</ref>\n\n===''World's End''===\nThe 2008 ''[[Number of the Beast (comics)|Number of the Beast]]'' Wildstorm limited series described the devastation of Earth, and set the scene for a new Authority ongoing series, by [[Dan Abnett]] and [[Andy Lanning]], part of the ''[[World's End (comics)|World's End]]'' storyline. In this series Midnighter appears as one of the last Authority members still able to act in the ruins of London, now called Unlondon. Separated from Apollo, who is confined to the upper atmosphere by sunlight-blocking fog over the planet's surface, Midnighter helps civilians to reach the ruins of the Carrier, now a stronghold for survivors. Midnighter is able to contact Apollo via balloons which he releases high up in the atmosphere.\n\nFollowing the resolution of the ''World's End'' storyline, the Authority's Carrier is called back to its creators. Jack Hawksmoor, Swift, and the Engineer go with it, but Midnighter remains on Earth to be with Apollo, who needs to be close to the sun.\n\n===''The New 52'': ''Stormwatch'', ''Grayson'' and ''Midnighter'' (2011-2016)===\n{{See also|Midnighter (2015 comic book)}}\nIn the autumn of 2011, DC relaunched its production with 52 new titles, including ''Stormwatch'' (written by [[Paul Cornell]] and drawn by Miguel Sepulveda). Cornell's ''Stormwatch'' #1 debuted a radically new version of the team, which lasted until spring 2013. Featuring longtime DC character [[Martian Manhunter]] and a number of new creations, Stormwatch was posited as a modern-day version of DC's [[Demon Knights]], and Midnighter and Apollo were introduced at the start of their careers, unaware of one another's sexualities and their mutual attraction to one another. The first issue depicts the group's attempt at recruiting Midnighter and Apollo. Lucas Trent was presented for the first time as Midnighter's actual name and his costume was redesigned drastically.<ref>''Stormwatch'' (vol. 3) #1 (September 2011)</ref> When Harry Tanner (who at the time was disguised as one of the Shadow Lords) framed Midnighter, he escaped, taking the Projectionist along with him. Eventually, when the team managed to capture him, Harry's ruse was revealed and Midnighter's innocence was proven. After the Engineer, who had been slowly losing her humanity, attacked them, Midnighter managed to escape with Apollo and with the help of his ally Zealot, attacked the base. After Jenny destroyed the base and killed the Engineer, the team mostly disassembled and Midnighter and Apollo realized that they had feelings for one another. For [[Jim Starlin]]'s run on the title with issue #19, a time travel incident returned Midnighter and Apollo to their original designs and status as long-time lovers, before the ''New 52'''s status quo for the characters was restored in the final issue.\n\nDuring the summer of 2014 he is regularly featured in the comic book series ''Grayson'' as he works to stop Spyral in collecting the body parts of a dead villain which endows those who have them the powers of the Justice League.\n\nThe character began appearing in his own ongoing [[DC Comics]] series in June 2015, written by [[Steve Orlando]]. In it, Midnighter, having broken up with Apollo, has to come to terms with being newly single, as well as tracking down a thief who stole exotic technology from the God Garden and is openly selling it to different individuals. Amongst the items stolen are files containing the origin of who Midnighter really was before the Gardener abducted and created him. After teaming up with Spyral agent Dick Grayson to track down Russian vampire thrill-killers, Midnighter accompanies his new boyfriend to the latter's hometown to track down those who attacked his father and encounters the mastermind behind the theft of the God Garden technology-[[Prometheus (DC Comics)|Prometheus]].\n\n===''DC Rebirth'': ''Midnighter and Apollo'' (2016-2017)===\n{{See also|Midnighter and Apollo}}\nThe character appears again along with his former boyfriend, [[Apollo (comics)|Apollo]] for a six-issue miniseries titled ''[[Midnighter and Apollo]]'', continuing in the ''[[The New 52|New 52]]'' canon, where the two of them have gotten back together as a couple. Apollo is attacked and his soul trapped in a [[Hell (DC Comics)|hell]] dimension, and Midnighter plans to rescue him. He learns by [[Extra\u00f1o]] where Apollo is trapped. He then goes in search of the Ace of Winchesters, killing a demon called Vodyanar to get one bullet and then going into Hell to take the Ace from the Lords of the Gun.\n\nMidnighter is also referenced in the newly renumbered ''Detective Comics'' as a Batman Family ally; it is mentioned that Nightwing reaches out to him to access Door technology.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Tynion IV|first1=James|title=Detective Comics #940|date=2016|publisher=DC Comics}}</ref> This implies that they have maintained their professional friendship from ''Grayson'' and the ''DCYou'' ''Midnighter'' series.\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nMidnighter's abilities are presented in the character's first appearance, occurring in ''Stormwatch'' (vol. 2 #4). Midnighter is the product of [[Biological engineering|bioengineered]] enhancements commissioned by the character of Henry Bendix. It is implied (as in the ''Midnighter'' solo series (issues #10\u201316)) that Midnighter was a normal human before enlisting with Stormwatch Black. Several [[Plot (narrative)|storylines]] have featured the deactivation,<ref>Micah Ian Wright, ''Stormwatch: Team Achilles'', 2004</ref> over-riding,<ref>Ed Brubaker, ''The Authority: Revolution'' volume 2, 2006</ref> or removal<ref>[[Mark Millar]], ''The Authority: Transfer of Power'' 2002; Garth Ennis, ''Midnighter'' issue #1, 2007</ref> of the character's [[Human enhancement|enhancements]] to reduce Midnighter's abilities to those of a normal man. The abortive ''Team Achilles'' series suggested that Bendix had \"designed\" Midnighter and Apollo during his childhood.\n\nTypically, Midnighter is presented with [[superhuman strength]], speed, reflexes and [[Endurance|resilience]]. The character is shown moving faster than both the human and superhuman eye, and in possession of a healing factor that allows him to rapidly recover from injury and illness. Storylines have shown Midnighter surviving a broken neck, broken limbs, holes through his chest and burning; the character is also portrayed clearing \"AIDS in six weeks\". Midnighter is capable of surviving in anaerobic environments for short time periods and possesses a secondary replacement heart. He also has the power to suppress pain so he can keep fighting when pain would stop a normal person.\n\nMany writers have referenced Midnighter's trademark ability to predict the unfolding of a battle before it starts. Early in Ellis's run on ''The Authority'', the character was described as having a mental combat computer, with neural-inductive implants, which he uses to run through a given combat situation millions of times in his mind, almost instantly covering nearly every possible result before the first punch is even thrown. This allows for the perfect response and counterattack, such that if Midnighter can possibly win a battle, he will. Ellis portrayed the Midnighter delivering a monologue on this ability to intimidate opponents; Keith Giffen later had the character distribute a business card to this effect, to save time. Howard Link of Stormwatch describes such an ingenious ability design as Neurotactical Wetware.<ref>''Stormwatch: Post Human/Earth Division'' (vol. 1) #18 (March 1st 2009)</ref> Issue #7 of the ''Midnighter'' solo series, written by Brian K. Vaughan, showed the character using this ability regressively, to visualize the desired outcome of a battle and work backwards logically to achieve it. The stand-alone ''Authority'' graphic novel ''Human on the Inside'', by John Ridley, suggested the ability was reactive, and required an opponent to make a first move to define the possibilities for a response. Though this is contradicted by numerous earlier, and later comics. Midnighter was also unable to use this ability against the [[Joker (character)|Joker]] due to the latter's extreme insanity, implying that Midnighter's ability to predict attacks in opponents with unpredictable nature are useless.\n\nIn ''The New 52'', Midnighter's ability are slightly different. His power to predict the outcome of any situation still exists, but appears to have been supplemented by a form of precognition as well as enhanced knowledge. He is able to finish other people's sentences before they have thought about it, and when Stormwatch's map of alien threats to Earth materialised in front of him and Apollo, he instantly knew what it was. He has significant resistance to telepathic attacks, as he was able to resist the Scourge of Worlds' attempt to use the Martian Manhunter's telepathy on him. He mentions that he has carbon-fibre muscles that presumably enhance his strength. Harry Tanner, reputed to be the world's greatest swordsman, struggled to land even a single blow on Midnighter since the latter could predict every move he would make. After a few seconds of fighting, Midnighter immediately knew what Harry's power was. He has demonstrated the ability to move so stealthily that the Manhunter and Hawksmoor could not hear or sense his stalking them until it was too late. His suit enhances his durability; he was able to survive unaided in hyperspace for a while.\n\n==Alternate versions==\n* In ''Wildstorm Winter Special 2005'', a story called ''Apollo & Midnighter: Two Dangerous Ideas'' features their alternate reality analogues, '''Pluto''' and '''Daylighter''', with inverted color schemes to match.

Part of the [[Bougainville campaign]], the battle occurred as a force of about 3,300 Japanese from the [[6th Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|Japanese 6th Division]] supported by a sizeable concentration of artillery launched a counterattack against the main Australian offensive which had been pushing south towards [[Buin, Papua New Guinea|Buin]], concentrating their attacks on Slater's Knoll near the Puriata River. The Australian troops belonged to the [[7th Brigade (Australia)|7th Brigade]], with the [[25th Battalion (Australia)|25th Infantry Battalion]] being the most heavily engaged, although the [[9th Battalion (Australia)|9th Infantry Battalion]] and the [[61st Battalion (Australia)|61st Infantry Battalion]] also took part in the fighting.\n\nAgainst Japanese tactics that included massed attacks, the Australians utilised [[Tank|armour]] and [[artillery]], and in the end these proved decisive. Commencing in late March, after the Australian advance had been halted by wet weather, over the course of several days the Japanese launched several probing raids followed by heavy attacks against the Australians.  The final assault on the knoll came on the night of 4/5 April when 129 men from 'B' Company, 25th Infantry Battalion repulsed an attack by a force of about 1,100 Japanese, killing 292. This proved to be the 7th Brigade's final involvement in the campaign as they were relieved by the [[15th Brigade (Australia)|15th Brigade]] shortly afterwards. Overall, 620 Japanese were killed in the battle with another 1,000 estimated to have been wounded, while the Australians suffered 189 casualties.\n{{TOC limit|2}}\n\n==Background==\nAt the beginning of 1945, the south-eastern part of Bougainville was occupied by the [[6th Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|Japanese 6th Division]],{{sfnp|Watt|2001|p=211}} under the command of [[Lieutenant General]] [[Tsutomu Akinaga]].{{#tag:ref|Akinaga, formerly chief of staff of the [[Seventeenth Army (Japan)|XVII Army]], took over command of the division from Lieutenant General [[Masatane Kanda]] when Kanda was promoted to take over XVII Army.{{sfnp|Tanaka|1980|p=286}}|group=Note}} Made up of the [[13th Infantry Regiment (Imperial Japanese Army)|13th]] and [[23rd Infantry Regiment (Imperial Japanese Army)|23rd Infantry Regiments]]\u2014600 and 700-strong respectively\u2014as well as the 6th Field Artillery Regiment, the 6th Engineer Regiment, the 6th Transport Regiment and the 4th Field Heavy Artillery Regiment, Akinaga's division consisted of 3,300 men.{{sfnp|Tanaka|1980|p=283}}{{sfnp|Long|1963|p=164}}{{#tag:ref|The Australian estimate of this force was between 2,400 and 2,700 men.{{sfnp|Long|1963|p=164}}|group=Note}}\n\nThe previous November, the [[II Corps (Australia)|Australian II Corps]] under Lieutenant General [[Stanley Savige]] had taken over responsibility of the island from the US [[XIV Corps (United States)|XIV Corps]], who had been transferred to fight in the [[Philippines Campaign (1944-45)|Philippines]]. Although incorrect, at the time the Allies believed that the Japanese forces on the island numbered around 17,500 men{{sfnp|Long|1963|p=102}}{{#tag:ref| Allied intelligence reports and estimates on this matter varied greatly and indeed after the war it was found that there had been more than 40,000 Japanese on the island at the time.{{sfnp|Grey|2008|p=191}}|group=Note}} and while these forces were understrength, they were still considered to be capable of carrying out effective combat operations. In order to counter this, it was decided that the Australian II Corps\u2014consisting of [[Australian Army Reserve|Militia]] and [[Second Australian Imperial Force|Australian Imperial Force]] troops from the [[3rd Division (Australia)|3rd Division]] and the [[11th Brigade (Australia)|11th]] and [[23rd Brigade (Australia)|23rd Brigades]]{{sfnp|Long|1963|p=92}}{{#tag:ref|Also attached to the Australian corps were two field artillery regiments, the [[2nd Field Regiment (Australia)|2nd]] and [[4th Field Regiment (Australia)|4th Field Regiments]], a company from the [[1st New Guinea Infantry Battalion]], the [[2/8th Commando Squadron (Australia)|2/8th Commando Squadron]], and a squadron of Matilda II tanks from [[2/4th Armoured Regiment (Australia)|2/4th Armoured Regiment]].{{sfn|Long|1963|p=99}}|group=Note}}\u2014would go on the offensive{{sfnp|Maitland|1999|p=108}} and a three-pronged campaign was planned in the northern, central and southern sectors of the island.{{sfnp|Johnston|2007|pp=30\u201331}}{{sfnp|Long|1963|p=113}}\n\nAs a result, the Australian campaign on the island developed into three separate drives: in the north, it was planned that Japanese forces would be forced into the narrow [[Bonis Peninsula]] and contained; in the centre, the [[Battle of Pearl Ridge|seizure of Pearl Ridge]] would give the Australians control of the east\u2013west thoroughfares and protection against further counterattacks, while also opening the way for a drive to the east coast; and the main campaign would take place in the south, where the bulk of the Japanese forces were concentrated.{{sfnp|Johnston|2007|pp=30\u201331}} Consequently, on 21 January, Savige directed the 3rd Division under Major General [[William Bridgeford]] to take \"swift and vigorous action\" to destroy Japanese forces in southern Bougainville. The division's immediate task was to advance south to the Puriata,{{#tag:ref|The Japanese name for this river was \"Priaka\".{{sfnp|Tanaka|1980|p=282}}|group=Note}} and send patrols across it. Savige considered that the Japanese division was \"weak and off balance\"{{sfnp|Long|1963|p=141}} due to casualties and disease as well as a shortage of supplies. Brigadier [[Raymond Monaghan]]'s [[29th Brigade (Australia)|29th Brigade]] had opened the campaign in the south in mid-December, crossing the Jaba River, before conducting a series of landings by barge along the coast of [[Empress Augusta Bay]], outflanking the Tuju, Tavera, Adele and Hupai Rivers, in what became dubbed the \"Battle of the Swamps\" by the Australians. The fighting during this time resulted in 240 Japanese killed, and 148 Australian casualties. Monaghan was also relieved of his command.{{sfnp|James|2012|pp=158\u2013167}}\n\nIn late January, the [[7th Brigade (Australia)|7th Brigade]], under Brigadier [[John Field (brigadier)|John Field]], which had been patrolling the Jaba River to protect the 29th Brigade's rear while they pushed south, was subsequently tasked to \"take Mosigetta, clear the enemy from the Kupon\u2013Nigitan\u2013Sisiruai area, and patrol along the Puriata\".{{sfnp|Long|1963|p=142}} Each of the brigade's three infantry battalions was marginally below full strength at the time, with frontages of between 600 and 700 personnel around the start of the battle.{{sfn|AWM52 8/3/46/25: 9th Infantry Battalion: March \u2013 April 1945|}}{{sfn|AWM52 8/3/63/23: 25th Infantry Battalion: March, May \u2013 June 1945 |}}{{sfn|AWM52 8/3/96/21: 61st Infantry Battalion: February \u2013 March 1945}}\n\n==Prelude==\nIn late January, a company from the Australian [[25th Battalion (Australia)|25th Infantry Battalion]]\u2014under Lieutenant Colonel [[John McKinna]]\u2014subsequently carried out an amphibious landing south of Motupena Point, on the [[Solomon Sea]] coast and had cleared towards Matsunkei. On 2 February, the battalion carried out another landing at Toko, and advanced northeast from there towards Batara, and then along the west bank of the Puriata, towards the Buin Road.{{sfnp|Long|1963|p=144}}{{#tag:ref|The Japanese name for the Buin Road was \"A Road\".{{sfnp|Tanaka|1980|p=284}}|group=Note}} Meanwhile, further to the east, the [[9th Battalion (Australia)|9th Infantry Battalion]] was moved by truck from Torokina to the Jaba River and then moved by barge along the Empress Augusta Bay coast, landing at Mawaraka from where they advanced towards Mosigetta, and the [[61st Battalion (Australia)|61st Infantry Battalion]] also proceeded towards there, setting off from the junction of the Jaba and Pagana Rivers while the [[2/8th Commando Squadron (Australia)|2/8th Commando Squadron]] provided flank security further to the east.{{sfnp|Long|1963|p=144}} Elements of the [[1st New Guinea Infantry Battalion]] also conducted a landing on the coast, on the 25th Battalion's left flank, to the north of Toko, and advanced to Makaku and then towards Mosigetta.{{sfnp|James|2012|loc=Map, p. 173}}\n\n[[File:61st Battalion Bougainville March 1945.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A black and white photograph of soldiers marching up a creek.

On 6 March, Japanese shelling of the knoll wounded an Australian, Private Carl Slater, who held his post until relieved. The only casualty during this period, the knoll was named after him as a result.{{sfnp|Long|1963|p=153}}{{#tag:ref|The Japanese called the knoll \"Goshu-dai\", which translates as \"Australian Heights\".{{sfnp|James|2012|p=191}}{{sfnp|Tanaka|1980|p=283}}|group=Note}} Throughout March, the 25th Infantry Battalion continued to expand its perimeter, to the north and south, along the Buin Road, while the 9th moved west from Mosigetta to link up with them and the 61st skirted east around Makapeka.{{sfnp|Long|1963|p=144}} By late March, though, heavy rain temporarily stopped the Australian advance, as the main road became impassable due to thick mud.{{sfnp|James|2012|p=193}}\n\nAlthough the Japanese sporadically [[artillery shell|shelled]] the knoll during March, there were no further Australian casualties. The 25th Infantry Battalion, which had established its headquarters and main defensive position around the knoll, in front of the Puriata River, sent out patrols every day, and on 9 March, one of these reported having killed 10 Japanese soldiers without loss to itself.{{sfnp|Long|1963|p=153}} The Japanese also began making dawn attacks, in which [[light machine gun]]ners would approach by stealth, set up and fire on the Australian positions, then retire to their own lines, {{convert|250|yd|m|abbr=on}} away. As the advance was halted, the Australians began to expect a major attack in the area of the knoll.{{sfnp|Long|1963|p=154}}{{sfnp|Maitland|1999|p=121}}\n\nThe Japanese launched a number of attacks on the Australians between 15 and 17 March.{{sfnp|Long|1963|p=154}} Under fire from three sides and in danger of being enveloped, on 19 March the Australians launched an attack of their own along the Buin Road, and although they had some success in clearing the forward Japanese positions, they then encountered a system of pillboxes and trenches around the Hatai Road junction.{{sfnp|Belham|Denham|2009|p=134}} The 25th Infantry Battalion's commander, McKinna, ordered the two platoons led by Lieutenant [[Richard David Keith Jefferies DSO|Dick Jefferies]] to attack the pillboxes, supported by a section of machine guns, and several [[PIAT]] anti-tank weapons. A two-hour fire-fight and a bayonet charge followed.{{sfnp|Long|1963|pp=154\u2013155}} This attack was ultimately beaten back by the defenders with the loss of eight Australians killed and 14 wounded.{{sfnp|Maitland|1999|p=121}}{{sfnp|Long|1963|p=155}} A second attack was launched on 22 March. Supported by heavy artillery, [[Mortar (weapon)|mortar]]s and machine guns, it proved successful, largely after the individual efforts of Corporal [[Reg Rattey]], who single-handedly silenced several bunkers.{{sfnp|Belham|Denham|2009|pp=134\u2013135}}{{sfnp|Maitland|1999|p=121}}\n\nAs the Australians began to prepare for the next stage of the offensive,{{sfnp|Johnston|2007|p=31}} important intelligence confirmed that the Japanese were planning a large-scale counterattack in the area.{{sfnp|Long|1963|p=158}} Believing that the Australian forces in the area surrounding the knoll were limited to just 400 men and observing that the Australians had not had time to reorganise, the Japanese XVII Army commander\u2014Lieutenant General [[Masatane Kanda]]\u2014ordered the 6th Division commander\u2014Akinaga\u2014to delay the Australian advance towards the south. Akinaga assessed that a counterattack against the Australian forces at this point with the entire weight of his division might be successful at this time and consequently he gave the order for his division to begin an attack across the Puriata.{{sfnp|Long|1963|p=164}}{{sfnp|Tanaka|1980|p=281}} Akinaga planned to commit 2,000 men to the assault, while 1,300 would be held back to act as ammunition carriers.{{sfnp|James|2012|p=191}}\n\nAccording to Karl James, no detailed orders were produced for the attack and deliberate planning was hastily completed with little or no co-ordination between the attacking infantry regiments. In addition, to increase the size of the infantry force, troops from the field artillery regiment were quickly re-roled as riflemen.{{sfnp|James|2012|p=191}} In the meantime, the Australians on Slater's Knoll, having been alerted to the possibility of a large-scale attack, began adjusting their defences. The soldiers cleared fields of fire and set out clear engagement areas to the north, northwest and south of the knoll, to allow maximum effectiveness of their supporting [[Vickers medium machine gun]]s and [[Bren light machine gun]]s. Barbed wire was laid out, and booby traps set.{{sfnp|James|2012|pp=193\u2013195}}\n\n==Battle==\n===Probing raids===\n[[File:Bougainville campaign 1945.jpg|220px|thumb|right|Some key locations in the Bougainville campaign.|alt=A map of Bougainville Island, indicating the location of several key battles in the campaign]]\n\nThe main attack was planned for 1 April, but as the various Japanese units moved into position,{{sfnp|Tanaka|1980|p=283}} a number of minor probes were made by elements of the Japanese 6th Engineer Regiment in the Australian rear areas and along their [[line of communication]]s.{{sfnp|Long|1963|p=158}}{{sfnp|Tanaka|1980|p=285}} The first raid came on the night of 27/28 March, when a force of about 100 Japanese exploited a gap between the 25th Infantry Battalion's main defensive position and its 'B' Echelon\u2014which included its transport and logistics elements and was protected by a company from the 61st Infantry Battalion\u2014fixed bayonets and then assaulted the rear of the Australian perimeter. The Australians had been alerted to their approach after the communication line between the two positions had been cut, and when the attack began the men had already been roused and the weapons pits fully manned. As a result, the attack failed and was turned back. A number of Japanese survivors managed to dig-in near the perimeter and later fired upon the Australian clearing patrol that was sent out the following morning, as well as snipe at the company defending 'B' Echelon's position. Afterwards, the Australians counted 19 dead Japanese around their position, while they also managed to capture one of the wounded. Against this, the 25th Infantry Battalion had lost three killed and seven wounded.{{sfnp|Maitland|1999|p=121}}{{sfnp|Long|1963|p=159}}\n\nAnother probe was made early on the morning of 28 March on the positions of the Australian 5th Field Battery, whose eight guns were located east of Toko, on the west bank of the Puriata River from where they could provide defensive fires in support of the 25th Infantry Battalion's main positions on the knoll. Shortly before dawn one of the [[booby trap]]s that the Australians had set around their perimeter to provide early warning was set off and one of the sentries opened fire upon what he believed to be a Japanese probe. A short time later, a small section of Japanese stumbled into one of the forward positions and fire was exchanged. Later, as a team was sent out to disarm the remaining booby traps, this team was fired upon and sporadic fighting continued until midday.{{sfnp|Long|1963|p=158}}\n\nThat evening, around 23:00, the 9th Infantry Battalion's rear echelon at Barara, along the Toko\u2013Mosigetta\u2013Buin Road, came under attack. Under the command of the battalion [[second-in-command]], and possessing only four Bren light machine guns for direct fire support, they were nevertheless able to hold off the initial attack. Following this, sporadic fighting continued into the early morning, when at 04:45 on 29 March a force of about 100 Japanese attacked the position supported by sustained machine gun and rifle fire. Rushing the Australian position with bayonets, they were beaten back by stiff defence and fell back from the position, leaving behind 23 dead but taking their wounded with them. Four Australians were wounded in this encounter.{{sfnp|Maitland|1999|p=121}}{{sfnp|Long|1963|p=159}}\n\nThroughout 29 March, the Japanese continued the tactic of using small-scale attacks to test the Australian defences and isolate the 25th Infantry Battalion's forward companies from its headquarters and rear. Over the course of the morning and into the afternoon, one of its companies was probed, while the headquarters also came under attack. The company from the 61st Infantry Battalion protecting the 25th Infantry Battalion's line of communications also came under attack from the 70 Japanese that were believed to be entrenched between the 'B' Echelon and the 25th's main positions, suffering two killed and two wounded.{{sfnp|Long|1963|p=159}} Later, it became clear to the Australians that the Japanese were preparing for a major attack against Slater's Knoll, following the capture of a Japanese sergeant who confirmed that the probes were, in the words of [[Gavin Long]], the \"prelude to a full-scale offensive\".{{sfnp|Long|1963|p=159}}\n\nThese probes intensified on 30 March, as one of the 25th Infantry Battalion's companies was strongly attacked by the Japanese. The Australian position had been weakened by having about a third of its strength out on patrol at the time of the attack. Unable to return to the perimeter while the company was under fire, they were forced to link up with one of the other companies further north. Meanwhile, the company was attacked four times throughout the day. The first three attacks were repulsed before the last attack came at 13:00, preceded by a heavy mortar bombardment. Twelve Japanese were killed in the attack, while one Australian was killed and two were missing in action. Nevertheless, the Australian position had been made untenable and they were forced to withdraw and link up with the company to the north. In doing so they left behind three mortars and a quantity of ammunition which the Japanese later brought into action against them.{{sfnp|Long|1963|p=160}}\n\n[[File:Bougainville Matilda (AWM 018384).jpg|thumb|left|[[Matilda II]] tanks of the Australian 2/4th Armoured Regiment advancing towards Slater's Knoll on 30 March 1945|alt=Soldiers in combat equipment carrying rifles advance along a dirt road in front of a tank]]\n\nCommunications between the brigade and battalion headquarters and the forward company positions broke down at this stage and runners had to be dispatched to pass a message asking for artillery support. Meanwhile, the supply situation for the Australians also became desperate as they had consumed all of their rations and had run out of water. The water situation was solved by digging a well within the perimeter,{{sfnp|Long|1963|p=160}} but it became clear that reinforcements were required. The Australian divisional commander, Bridgeford, subsequently placed a squadron of [[Matilda II|Matilda tanks]] under Major Kenneth Arnott from the [[2/4th Armoured Regiment (Australia)|2/4th Armoured Regiment]] at the 7th Brigade commander's disposal, and over the course of the day these tanks were brought up towards the 25th's position from Toko where they had been put ashore from landing craft. Engineers were used to bridge a number of creeks and streams, while bulldozers were also employed to improve the terrain or to pull the tanks along when they were unable move under their own power.{{sfnp|Long|1963|p=161}}\n\nThis was the first time tanks had been used in the campaign and the going was slow. By 19:00 on 30 March they reached the 'B' Echelon position. Early on 31 March the tanks moved up to the battalion headquarters on Slater's Knoll where they were escorted by a [[platoon]] from the headquarters company and moved out again, once again using bulldozers to improve the ground in front of them. Just as they did, the Japanese launched an attack on one of the isolated companies. When they were {{convert|400|yd|m|abbr=on}} from the forward positions, the infantry deployed to the left and right of the tanks and they began their advance to contact, arriving just in time to help defeat the Japanese attack.{{sfnp|Long|1963|p=161}}\n\nAs the forward companies began to move back towards the main defensive position, jeeps were sent up to collect the wounded while McKinna led a force of two platoons and two tanks out to the perimeter at the Hatai junction. There they were able to reclaim the mortars that had earlier been abandoned and destroyed them so that they could not be used against the Australians again, but the jeeps carrying the wounded ran into a Japanese ambush in which five Australians were killed.{{sfnp|Long|1963|pp=161\u2013162}} McKinna then organised a quick counterattack, taking a force up the road along with three tanks and subsequently attacking the ambushing force, killing 11, before forming a harbour around the tanks for the night.{{sfnp|Long|1963|p=162}}\n\n===First major assault===\nThe next morning, 1 April, the Australians extended across the Kero Creek and advanced north to the Puriata where they established a perimeter {{convert|1000|yd|m|abbr=on}} south of Slater's Knoll.{{sfnp|Long|1963|p=162}} Around 12:00, the Japanese 6th Field Artillery Regiment, whose gunners had been converted to the role of infantry, set up a form-up position {{convert|50|m|yd|abbr=on}} to the front of the Australian company holding the perimeter to the south of Slater's Knoll at a location the Japanese called Pain, which lay along the Buin Road.{{sfnp|Tanaka|1980|p=284}} Before the attack could be launched, the Australians detected the movement of the Japanese and began firing upon them. Shortly after 12:40, the Japanese gunners launched their assault. Firing their weapons from the hip, they rushed the Australian position, pushing the defenders back, leaving dead and wounded behind. That evening, the Australians launched a series of determined counterattacks in order to re-establish contact between Slater's Knoll and the forward companies, however, these were turned back.{{sfnp|Tanaka|1980|p=284}}{{sfnp|Long|1963|p=162}}\n\n[[File:Battle of Slaters knoll 1942 s.jpg|220px|thumb|right|Location of the Battle of Slater's Knoll in south west Bougainville.|alt=A location map, depicting a portion of the western coast of Bougainville, showing the relative position of Slater's Knoll, the Buin Road and several other key locations]]\n\nMeanwhile, the Japanese 23rd Infantry Regiment, which had advanced on the right flank from Barara{{#tag:ref| The Japanese name for this location was \"Bara Bara\".{{sfnp|Tanaka|1980|p=284}}|group=Note}} attempted to move on Slater's Knoll from the north. Finding its way blocked by wire obstacles and lacking the equipment necessary to remove them, it was forced to halt its advance and cover the flank of Colonel Toyoji Muta's 13th Infantry Regiment, which was attempting to launch an assault across the Puriata.{{sfnp|Tanaka|1980|p=284}} At this point, the river was about {{convert|100|m|yd|abbr=on}} across and {{convert|1|m|ft|abbr=on}} deep, while the opposite bank was about {{convert|1|m|ft|abbr=on}} high. The crossing began at 03:00 on 1 April, and the three battalions made heavy work of it. When they were halfway across, the two forward battalions were spotted by the Australians in the moonlight and engaged with machine gun and rifle fire.{{sfnp|Tanaka|1980|p=284}} The Japanese quickly deployed and attempted to launch an attack; however, in the confusion the 1st Battalion, 23rd Infantry Regiment was cut off from the rest of the assault force. As daylight came, the Australians were able to call down mortar fire on the Japanese, causing considerable casualties. Running low on ammunition and having suffered considerable losses, the 23rd Infantry were forced to withdraw. The 1st Battalion  remained cut off until the evening of 1 April, when it was able to re-establish contact with the other two battalions and report to the divisional commander that the attack had been unsuccessful.{{sfnp|Tanaka|1980|pp=284\u2013285}}\n\n===Lull in the battle and secondary attack===\nOn 2 April, the Japanese divisional commander, Akinaga, called the 13th and 23rd Infantry Regiments back across the Puriata, to a position south-west of the Pain feature.{{sfnp|Tanaka|1980|p=285}} At this point, the decision was made to launch a fresh attack aimed at taking Slater's Knoll and eliminating the Australian forces in the area surrounding the Puriata ford.{{sfnp|Long|1963|p=164}} The attack was scheduled for 5 April, and over the course of the following three days, contact was minimal. In this time, there were a few minor skirmishes, and small groups of Japanese were seen by the Australians around Barara, Slater's Knoll and Mosigetta. As further intelligence reports came in, it became clear to the Australian commanders that the Japanese were about to deliver the main attack.{{sfnp|Long|1963|p=162}}\n\nOn the night of 4/5 April, the Japanese heavily shelled the Australian artillery battery, while communications between brigade headquarters and the 25th Infantry Battalion headquarters were severed, as were the lines from the 25th Infantry Battalion's headquarters to its forward companies. Suspecting that the attack was about to commence, runners were sent and the men defending Slater's Knoll, now consisting of a force of only 129 men from 'B' Company, stood-to.{{sfnp|Maitland|1999|p=121}}{{sfnp|Long|1963|p=162}}\n\nAt 05:00 on 5 April, the Japanese launched an attack from the north. This was followed almost simultaneously by a stronger attack from the south-west.{{sfnp|Long|1963|pp=162\u2013163}} For the next 80 minutes, 900\u20131,100 Japanese from the 13th and 23rd Infantry Regiments attacked the small Australian force in waves.{{sfnp|Tanaka|1980|p=285}}{{sfnp|Watt|2001|pp=226\u2013229}} They overwhelmed the Australian forward positions, but finding their way blocked by wire obstacles and lacking any equipment to deal with them the Japanese attack stalled.{{sfnp|Tanaka|1980|p=285}} Quickly, the situation was turned back in favour of the Australians, and the Japanese were cut down by heavy defensive artillery fire and by well-sited machine guns.{{sfnp|Watt|2001|pp=226\u2013229}} A further attack was launched by a smaller force along the Buin Road and aimed at two of the forward companies positioned there. This attack was beaten back also. After regrouping, the surviving members of the 13th Infantry Regiment began preparing for a final charge, determined to fight to the last man. Their commander, Muta, in a final act of defiance wrapped his unit's banner around his waist and armed himself with a grenade with which to blow himself up during the assault. Elsewhere, the remaining officers of the 23rd Infantry made a pact to hurl themselves against the Australians one last time in a suicidal charge. Nevertheless, Akinaga, realising that further assaults were futile finally dispatched the order to cancel the attack.{{sfnp|James|2012|p=211}}  At around 08:30, the Australians realised that the Japanese had decided that they had had enough. Just after midday, two tanks were dispatched from the 'B' Echelon perimeter, escorted by a company from the 61st Infantry Battalion, arriving on the knoll by 13:45 where they were used as fire support as the Australians began to carry out mopping up operations, flushing out small groups of survivors all around the position.{{sfnp|Long|1963|p=163}}\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe day after the final Japanese assault on the knoll, 292 dead Japanese were counted around 'B' Company's perimeter.{{sfnp|Long|1963|p=163}}{{sfnp|Coulthard-Clark|1998|p=250}} In total, over the course of the battle, the Australians counted 620 Japanese killed, and estimated that another 1,000 had probably been wounded.{{sfnp|Coulthard-Clark|1998|p=251}} Information obtained from captured Japanese clarified that the Australians had come up against a force of at least 2,400 troops.{{sfnp|Belham|Denham|2009|p=140}} The commander of the 23rd Infantry Regiment, Lieutenant Colonel Kawano Koji, was among the dead, as was a senior divisional staff officer, Lieutenant Colonel Honda Matsuo.{{sfnp|James|2012|p=208}} Four wounded Japanese were also taken [[prisoner of war]]. Casualties for the Australians included 10 officers and 179 other ranks killed or wounded, while there had been a further 81 Australians evacuated due to non-combat related issues.{{sfnp|Long|1963|pp=163\u2013164}} Wartime Japanese casualty estimates vary from these figures, though, claiming to have killed 1,800 Australians, while placing their own losses at 280 killed and 320 wounded. Long argues that these figures are problematic, as based upon the same report, the Japanese believed that there were only 400 Australians in the region during the battle, and yet they claimed to have killed almost five times that number.{{sfnp|Long|1963|p=164}}\n\n[[File:Japanese dead after the Battle of Slater's Knoll.jpg|thumb|left|Japanese killed during the final assault on Slater's Knoll are buried the day after the battle|alt=Soldiers burying dead in a large pit]]\n\nThe result of the battle had a profound effect on the Japanese commanders. According to James, Kanda had been \"so certain of victory...[he]...had not developed any plans for...subsequent activities\".{{sfnp|James|2012|p=218}} Nevertheless, after the battle, the Japanese forces in the area pulled back to the [[Hongorai River]], where they were reorganised due to the heavy losses, with several infantry, engineer and artillery units being amalgamated. Lacking food, suffering the effects of disease, and isolated from home, morale amongst the Japanese troops fell heavily, with many realising that the war was lost. There was an increase in desertions at this time, although the vast majority continued to fight, if only because they were under orders to do so.{{sfnp|James|2012|pp=210\u2013219}}\n\nOperationally, the battle proved to the Australian high command how effective armour could be when used in close co-operation with infantry and in protecting the lines of communication.{{sfnp|Long|1963|p=164}} The use of [[Universal carrier|machine gun carriers]] to carry out the wounded had also been quite effective.{{sfnp|Belham|Denham|2009|p=140}} While the Japanese soldiers and officers on the ground fought bravely, continuing the assault even when it was clear it had failed, ultimately the battle proved to be a decisive Australian victory; however, James notes that poor planning and unreliable communications had also contributed to the result.{{sfnp|James|2012|p=210}} Long goes on to argue that if the Japanese commander had been more flexible in his tactics, the result might have been different. The Australian right flank had been vulnerable, but Akinaga did not exploit this opportunity.{{sfnp|Long|1963|p=164}}\n\nThere were tactical deficiencies as well, particularly the predictability of cutting Australian signals lines just before an attack and bunching together in tight groups during an assault, allowing the Australians to take full toll with their machine guns. The Australian commander of the 25th Infantry Battalion, McKinna, had spread his companies out effectively and went forward to direct the fighting at several points. Fields of fire had been cleared, perimeters set and patrolling had been maintained.{{sfnp|James|2012|pp=211\u2013212}} Nevertheless, the Australians had also failed to seize opportunities as they arose, for after the battle they did not follow up their success immediately. After the failure of the final assault, the Japanese had possessed no forces in the immediate vicinity that would have been capable of resisting any follow up forces that the Australians might have been able to bring up and it is possible that an advance could have been carried all the way to the Hongorai River. As it was, however, the Australian line of supply was stretched and it was necessary for a pause before the advance could continue in earnest.{{sfnp|Long|1963|p=165}}\n\nIn the days immediately after the battle, the Australians continued to carry out patrolling operations around the knoll. On 7 April, a patrol from the 9th Infantry Battalion clashed with a Japanese force of about 30 men and in the ensuing engagement four Japanese were killed, while a patrol from the 61st Infantry Battalion on 8 April killed another five. On 13 April, the order was given that the 7th Brigade would be gradually withdrawn and relieved by the [[15th Brigade (Australia)|15th]].{{sfnp|Long|1963|p=166}}{{sfnp|Watt|2001|p=231}} Shortly afterwards, the [[58th/59th Battalion (Australia)|58th/59th Infantry Battalion]] replaced the 25th in occupation of the knoll, while the [[24th Battalion (Australia)|24th Infantry Battalion]] resumed the advance along the Buin Road on 17 April,{{sfnp|Keogh|1965|p=419}} subsequently taking part in the [[Battle of the Hongorai River|fighting along the Hongorai River]].{{sfnp|Maitland|1999|p=122}} The 9th Infantry Battalion, however, was not withdrawn immediately, and remained in the northern area until it handed over to the [[57th/60th Battalion (Australia)|57th/60th Infantry Battalion]] in early May. The fighting on Bougainville continued throughout April as the Japanese resisted the Australian advance and went on until July when the fighting petered out due to heavy rain and flooding.{{sfnp|Maitland|1999|pp=122\u2013123}}\n\nAfter the war, the [[battle honour]] of \"Slater's Knoll\" was awarded to the 25th Infantry Battalion and the 2/4th Armoured Regiment. Neither the 9th or 61st Infantry Battalions were similarly credited, although according to Gordon Maitland there seems to be no explanation as to why.{{sfnp|Maitland|1999|p=145}} For his actions during the attack on the Japanese pillboxes on 22 March, Rattey later received the [[Victoria Cross]]. Initially, his battalion commander, McKinna, had nominated him for the lesser [[Distinguished Conduct Medal]], but on review by Field, the brigade commander, the nomination was elevated. It was subsequently announced in the ''London Gazette'' in July 1945.{{sfnp|''London Gazette'' 24 July 1945|p=3857}}{{sfnp|James|2012|p=212}}\n\n==Notes==\n===Footnotes===\n{{Reflist|group=Note}}\n\n===Citations===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Refbegin}}\n* {{cite web |url = https://www.awm.gov.au/collection/RCDIG1022979/ |title=AWM52 8/3/46/25: 9th Infantry Battalion: March \u2013 April 1945 |work=Unit war diaries |publisher=Australian War Memorial |accessdate=24 April 2016|ref=CITEREFAWM52 8/3/46/25: 9th Infantry Battalion: March \u2013 April 1945 }}\n* {{cite web |url = https://www.awm.gov.au/collection/RCDIG1026959/ |title=AWM52 8/3/63/23: 25th Infantry Battalion: March, May \u2013 June 1945 |work=Unit war diaries |publisher=Australian War Memorial |accessdate=24 April 2016|ref=CITEREFAWM52 8/3/63/23: 25th Infantry Battalion: March, May \u2013 June 1945 }}\n* {{cite web |url = https://www.awm.gov.au/collection/RCDIG1026922/ |title=AWM52 8/3/96/21: 61st Infantry Battalion: February \u2013 March 1945|work=Unit war diaries |publisher=Australian War Memorial |accessdate=24 April 2016|ref=CITEREFAWM52 8/3/96/21: 61st Infantry Battalion: February \u2013 March 1945 }}\n* {{cite book|last1=Belham|first1=David|last2=Denham |first2= Peter|title=The Blue Diamonds: The History of 7th Brigade, 1915\u20132008|year=2009|publisher=Department of Defence|location=Puckapunyal, Victoria|oclc=525034269|ref=harv}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Coulthard-Clark|first=Chris|title=Where Australians Fought: The Encyclopaedia of Australia's Battles|year=1998|publisher=Allen & Unwin|location=St Leonards, New South Wales|isbn= 1-86448-611-2|ref=harv}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Grey|first=Jeffrey|title=A Military History of Australia|edition=3rd |publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Melbourne, Victoria|year=2008|isbn= 978-0-521-69791-0|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last=James|first=Karl|title=The Hard Slog: Australians in the Bougainville Campaign, 1944\u201345|year=2012|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Port Melbourne, Victoria|isbn=978-1-107-01732-0|ref=harv}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Johnston|first=Mark |authorlink=Mark Johnston (historian)|title=The Australian Army in World War II|year=2007|publisher =Osprey Publishing|location=Botley, Oxford|isbn=978-1-84603-123-6|ref=harv}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Keogh|first=Eustace|title=South West Pacific 1941\u201345|year=1965|publisher= Grayflower Publications|location=Melbourne, Victoria|oclc=7185705|ref=harv}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Long|first=Gavin |authorlink=Gavin Long |title=The Final Campaigns|series=Australia in the War of 1939\u20131945, Series 1\u2014Army.

Part of the [[Bougainville campaign]], the battle occurred as a force of about 3,300 Japanese from the [[6th Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|Japanese 6th Division]] supported by a sizeable concentration of artillery launched a counterattack against the main Australian offensive which had been pushing south towards [[Buin, Papua New Guinea|Buin]], concentrating their attacks on Slater's Knoll near the Puriata River. The Australian troops belonged to the [[7th Brigade (Australia)|7th Brigade]], with the [[25th Battalion (Australia)|25th Infantry Battalion]] being the most heavily engaged, although the [[9th Battalion (Australia)|9th Infantry Battalion]] and the [[61st Battalion (Australia)|61st Infantry Battalion]] also took part in the fighting.\n\nAgainst Japanese tactics that included massed attacks, the Australians utilised [[Tank|armour]] and [[artillery]], and in the end these proved decisive. Commencing in late March, after the Australian advance had been halted by wet weather, over the course of several days the Japanese launched several probing raids followed by heavy attacks against the Australians.  The final assault on the knoll came on the night of 4/5 April when 129 men from 'B' Company, 25th Infantry Battalion repulsed an attack by a force of about 1,100 Japanese, killing 292. This proved to be the 7th Brigade's final involvement in the campaign as they were relieved by the [[15th Brigade (Australia)|15th Brigade]] shortly afterwards. Overall, 620 Japanese were killed in the battle with another 1,000 estimated to have been wounded, while the Australians suffered 189 casualties.\n{{TOC limit|2}}\n\n==Background==\nAt the beginning of 1945, the south-eastern part of Bougainville was occupied by the [[6th Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|Japanese 6th Division]],{{sfnp|Watt|2001|p=211}} under the command of [[Lieutenant General]] [[Tsutomu Akinaga]].{{#tag:ref|Akinaga, formerly chief of staff of the [[Seventeenth Army (Japan)|XVII Army]], took over command of the division from Lieutenant General [[Masatane Kanda]] when Kanda was promoted to take over XVII Army.{{sfnp|Tanaka|1980|p=286}}|group=Note}} Made up of the [[13th Infantry Regiment (Imperial Japanese Army)|13th]] and [[23rd Infantry Regiment (Imperial Japanese Army)|23rd Infantry Regiments]]\u2014600 and 700-strong respectively\u2014as well as the 6th Field Artillery Regiment, the 6th Engineer Regiment, the 6th Transport Regiment and the 4th Field Heavy Artillery Regiment, Akinaga's division consisted of 3,300 men.{{sfnp|Tanaka|1980|p=283}}{{sfnp|Long|1963|p=164}}{{#tag:ref|The Australian estimate of this force was between 2,400 and 2,700 men.{{sfnp|Long|1963|p=164}}|group=Note}}\n\nThe previous November, the [[II Corps (Australia)|Australian II Corps]] under Lieutenant General [[Stanley Savige]] had taken over responsibility of the island from the US [[XIV Corps (United States)|XIV Corps]], who had been transferred to fight in the [[Philippines Campaign (1944-45)|Philippines]].

In order to counter this, it was decided that the Australian II Corps\u2014consisting of [[Australian Army Reserve|Militia]] and [[Second Australian Imperial Force|Australian Imperial Force]] troops from the [[3rd Division (Australia)|3rd Division]] and the [[11th Brigade (Australia)|11th]] and [[23rd Brigade (Australia)|23rd Brigades]]{{sfnp|Long|1963|p=92}}{{#tag:ref|Also attached to the Australian corps were two field artillery regiments, the [[2nd Field Regiment (Australia)|2nd]] and [[4th Field Regiment (Australia)|4th Field Regiments]], a company from the [[1st New Guinea Infantry Battalion]], the [[2/8th Commando Squadron (Australia)|2/8th Commando Squadron]], and a squadron of Matilda II tanks from [[2/4th Armoured Regiment (Australia)|2/4th Armoured Regiment]].{{sfn|Long|1963|p=99}}|group=Note}}\u2014would go on the offensive{{sfnp|Maitland|1999|p=108}} and a three-pronged campaign was planned in the northern, central and southern sectors of the island.{{sfnp|Johnston|2007|pp=30\u201331}}{{sfnp|Long|1963|p=113}}\n\nAs a result, the Australian campaign on the island developed into three separate drives: in the north, it was planned that Japanese forces would be forced into the narrow [[Bonis Peninsula]] and contained; in the centre, the [[Battle of Pearl Ridge|seizure of Pearl Ridge]] would give the Australians control of the east\u2013west thoroughfares and protection against further counterattacks, while also opening the way for a drive to the east coast; and the main campaign would take place in the south, where the bulk of the Japanese forces were concentrated.{{sfnp|Johnston|2007|pp=30\u201331}} Consequently, on 21 January, Savige directed the 3rd Division under Major General [[William Bridgeford]] to take \"swift and vigorous action\" to destroy Japanese forces in southern Bougainville. The division's immediate task was to advance south to the Puriata,{{#tag:ref|The Japanese name for this river was \"Priaka\".{{sfnp|Tanaka|1980|p=282}}|group=Note}} and send patrols across it. Savige considered that the Japanese division was \"weak and off balance\"{{sfnp|Long|1963|p=141}} due to casualties and disease as well as a shortage of supplies. Brigadier [[Raymond Monaghan]]'s [[29th Brigade (Australia)|29th Brigade]] had opened the campaign in the south in mid-December, crossing the Jaba River, before conducting a series of landings by barge along the coast of [[Empress Augusta Bay]], outflanking the Tuju, Tavera, Adele and Hupai Rivers, in what became dubbed the \"Battle of the Swamps\" by the Australians. The fighting during this time resulted in 240 Japanese killed, and 148 Australian casualties.

The 25th Infantry Battalion, which had established its headquarters and main defensive position around the knoll, in front of the Puriata River, sent out patrols every day, and on 9 March, one of these reported having killed 10 Japanese soldiers without loss to itself.{{sfnp|Long|1963|p=153}} The Japanese also began making dawn attacks, in which [[light machine gun]]ners would approach by stealth, set up and fire on the Australian positions, then retire to their own lines, {{convert|250|yd|m|abbr=on}} away. As the advance was halted, the Australians began to expect a major attack in the area of the knoll.{{sfnp|Long|1963|p=154}}{{sfnp|Maitland|1999|p=121}}\n\nThe Japanese launched a number of attacks on the Australians between 15 and 17 March.{{sfnp|Long|1963|p=154}} Under fire from three sides and in danger of being enveloped, on 19 March the Australians launched an attack of their own along the Buin Road, and although they had some success in clearing the forward Japanese positions, they then encountered a system of pillboxes and trenches around the Hatai Road junction.{{sfnp|Belham|Denham|2009|p=134}} The 25th Infantry Battalion's commander, McKinna, ordered the two platoons led by Lieutenant [[Richard David Keith Jefferies DSO|Dick Jefferies]] to attack the pillboxes, supported by a section of machine guns, and several [[PIAT]] anti-tank weapons. A two-hour fire-fight and a bayonet charge followed.{{sfnp|Long|1963|pp=154\u2013155}} This attack was ultimately beaten back by the defenders with the loss of eight Australians killed and 14 wounded.{{sfnp|Maitland|1999|p=121}}{{sfnp|Long|1963|p=155}} A second attack was launched on 22 March. Supported by heavy artillery, [[Mortar (weapon)|mortar]]s and machine guns, it proved successful, largely after the individual efforts of Corporal [[Reg Rattey]], who single-handedly silenced several bunkers.{{sfnp|Belham|Denham|2009|pp=134\u2013135}}{{sfnp|Maitland|1999|p=121}}\n\nAs the Australians began to prepare for the next stage of the offensive,{{sfnp|Johnston|2007|p=31}} important intelligence confirmed that the Japanese were planning a large-scale counterattack in the area.{{sfnp|Long|1963|p=158}} Believing that the Australian forces in the area surrounding the knoll were limited to just 400 men and observing that the Australians had not had time to reorganise, the Japanese XVII Army commander\u2014Lieutenant General [[Masatane Kanda]]\u2014ordered the 6th Division commander\u2014Akinaga\u2014to delay the Australian advance towards the south. Akinaga assessed that a counterattack against the Australian forces at this point with the entire weight of his division might be successful at this time and consequently he gave the order for his division to begin an attack across the Puriata.{{sfnp|Long|1963|p=164}}{{sfnp|Tanaka|1980|p=281}} Akinaga planned to commit 2,000 men to the assault, while 1,300 would be held back to act as ammunition carriers.{{sfnp|James|2012|p=191}}\n\nAccording to Karl James, no detailed orders were produced for the attack and deliberate planning was hastily completed with little or no co-ordination between the attacking infantry regiments. In addition, to increase the size of the infantry force, troops from the field artillery regiment were quickly re-roled as riflemen.{{sfnp|James|2012|p=191}} In the meantime, the Australians on Slater's Knoll, having been alerted to the possibility of a large-scale attack began adjusting their defences. The soldiers cleared fields off fire and set out clear engagement areas to the north, northwest and south of the knoll, to allow maximum effectiveness of their supporting [[Vickers medium machine gun]]s and [[Bren light machine gun]]s. Barbed wire was laid out, and booby traps set.{{sfnp|James|2012|pp=193\u2013195}}\n\n==Battle==\n===Probing raids===\n[[File:Bougainville campaign 1945.jpg|220px|thumb|right|Some key locations in the Bougainville campaign.|alt=A map of Bougainville Island, indicating the location of several key battles in the campaign]]\n\nThe main attack was planned for 1 April, but as the various Japanese units moved into position,{{sfnp|Tanaka|1980|p=283}} a number of minor probes were made by elements of the Japanese 6th Engineer Regiment in the Australian rear areas and along their [[line of communication]]s.{{sfnp|Long|1963|p=158}}{{sfnp|Tanaka|1980|p=285}} The first raid came on the night of 27/28 March, when a force of about 100 Japanese exploited a gap between the 25th Infantry Battalion's main defensive position and its 'B' Echelon\u2014which included its transport and logistics elements and was protected by a company from the 61st Infantry Battalion\u2014fixed bayonets and then assaulted the rear of the Australian perimeter. The Australians had been alerted to their approach after the communication line between the two positions had been cut, and when the attack began the men had already been roused and the weapons pits fully manned. As a result, the attack failed and was turned back. A number of Japanese survivors managed to dig-in near the perimeter and later fired upon the Australian clearing patrol that was sent out the following morning, as well as snipe at the company defending 'B' Echelon's position. Afterwards, the Australians counted 19 dead Japanese around their position, while they also managed to capture one of the wounded. Against this, the 25th Infantry Battalion had lost three killed and seven wounded.{{sfnp|Maitland|1999|p=121}}{{sfnp|Long|1963|p=159}}\n\nAnother probe was made early on the morning of 28 March on the positions of the Australian 5th Field Battery, whose eight guns were located east of Toko, on the west bank of the Puriata River from where they could provide defensive fires in support of the 25th Infantry Battalion's main positions on the knoll. Shortly before dawn one of the [[booby trap]]s that the Australians had set around their perimeter to provide early warning was set off and one of the sentries opened fire upon what he believed to be a Japanese probe. A short time later, a small section of Japanese stumbled into one of the forward positions and fire was exchanged. Later, as a team was sent out to disarm the remaining booby traps, this team was fired upon and sporadic fighting continued until midday.{{sfnp|Long|1963|p=158}}\n\nThat evening, around 23:00, the 9th Infantry Battalion's rear echelon at Barara, along the Toko\u2013Mosigetta\u2013Buin Road, came under attack. Under the command of the battalion [[second-in-command]], and possessing only four Bren light machine guns for direct fire support, they were nevertheless able to hold off the initial attack. Following this, sporadic fighting continued into the early morning, when at 04:45 on 29 March a force of about 100 Japanese attacked the position supported by sustained machine gun and rifle fire. Rushing the Australian position with bayonets, they were beaten back by stiff defence and fell back from the position, leaving behind 23 dead but taking their wounded with them. Four Australians were wounded in this encounter.{{sfnp|Maitland|1999|p=121}}{{sfnp|Long|1963|p=159}}\n\nThroughout 29 March, the Japanese continued the tactic of using small-scale attacks to test the Australian defences and isolate the 25th Infantry Battalion's forward companies from its headquarters and rear. Over the course of the morning and into the afternoon, one of its companies was probed, while the headquarters also came under attack. The company from the 61st Infantry Battalion protecting the 25th Infantry Battalion's line of communications also came under attack from the 70 Japanese that were believed to be entrenched between the 'B' Echelon and the 25th's main positions, suffering two killed and two wounded.{{sfnp|Long|1963|p=159}} Later, it became clear to the Australians that the Japanese were preparing for a major attack against Slater's Knoll, following the capture of a Japanese sergeant who confirmed that the probes were, in the words of [[Gavin Long]], the \"prelude to a full-scale offensive\".{{sfnp|Long|1963|p=159}}\n\nThese probes intensified on 30 March, as one of the 25th Infantry Battalion's companies was strongly attacked by the Japanese. The Australian position had been weakened by having about a third of its strength out on patrol at the time of the attack. Unable to return to the perimeter while the company was under fire, they were forced to link up with one of the other companies further north. Meanwhile, the company was attacked four times throughout the day. The first three attacks were repulsed before the last attack came at 13:00, preceded by a heavy mortar bombardment. Twelve Japanese were killed in the attack, while one Australian was killed and two were missing in action. Nevertheless, the Australian position had been made untenable and they were forced to withdraw and link up with the company to the north. In doing so they left behind three mortars and a quantity of ammunition which the Japanese later brought into action against them.{{sfnp|Long|1963|p=160}}\n\n[[File:Bougainville Matilda (AWM 018384).jpg|thumb|left|[[Matilda II]] tanks of the Australian 2/4th Armoured Regiment advancing towards Slater's Knoll on 30 March 1945|alt=Soldiers in combat equipment carrying rifles advance along a dirt road in front of a tank]]\n\nCommunications between the brigade and battalion headquarters and the forward company positions broke down at this stage and runners had to be dispatched to pass a message asking for artillery support. Meanwhile, the supply situation for the Australians also became desperate as they had consumed all of their rations and had run out of water. The water situation was solved by digging a well within the perimeter,{{sfnp|Long|1963|p=160}} but it became clear that reinforcements were required. The Australian divisional commander, Bridgeford, subsequently placed a squadron of [[Matilda II|Matilda tanks]] under Major Kenneth Arnott from the [[2/4th Armoured Regiment (Australia)|2/4th Armoured Regiment]] at the 7th Brigade commander's disposal, and over the course of the day these tanks were brought up towards the 25th's position from Toko where they had been put ashore from landing craft. Engineers were used to bridge a number of creeks and streams, while bulldozers were also employed to improve the terrain or to pull the tanks along when they were unable move under their own power.{{sfnp|Long|1963|p=161}}\n\nThis was the first time tanks had been used in the campaign and the going was slow. By 19:00 on 30 March they reached the 'B' Echelon position. Early on 31 March the tanks moved up to the battalion headquarters on Slater's Knoll where they were escorted by a [[platoon]] from the headquarters company and moved out again, once again using bulldozers to improve the ground in front of them. Just as they did, the Japanese launched an attack on one of the isolated companies. When they were {{convert|400|yd|m|abbr=on}} from the forward positions, the infantry deployed to the left and right of the tanks and they began their advance to contact, arriving just in time to help defeat the Japanese attack.{{sfnp|Long|1963|p=161}}\n\nAs the forward companies began to move back towards the main defensive position, jeeps were sent up to collect the wounded while McKinna led a force of two platoons and two tanks out to the perimeter at the Hatai junction. There they were able to reclaim the mortars that had earlier been abandoned and destroyed them so that they could not be used against the Australians again, but the jeeps carrying the wounded ran into a Japanese ambush in which five Australians were killed.{{sfnp|Long|1963|pp=161\u2013162}} McKinna then organised a quick counterattack, taking a force up the road along with three tanks and subsequently attacking the ambushing force, killing 11, before forming a harbour around the tanks for the night.{{sfnp|Long|1963|p=162}}\n\n===First major assault===\nThe next morning, 1 April, the Australians extended across the Kero Creek and advanced north to the Puriata where they established a perimeter {{convert|1000|yd|m|abbr=on}} south of Slater's Knoll.{{sfnp|Long|1963|p=162}} Around 12:00, the Japanese 6th Field Artillery Regiment, whose gunners had been converted to the role of infantry, set up a form-up position {{convert|50|m|yd|abbr=on}} to the front of the Australian company holding the perimeter to the south of Slater's Knoll at a location the Japanese called Pain, which lay along the Buin Road.{{sfnp|Tanaka|1980|p=284}} Before the attack could be launched, the Australians detected the movement of the Japanese and began firing upon them. Shortly after 12:40, the Japanese gunners launched their assault. Firing their weapons from the hip, they rushed the Australian position, pushing the defenders back, leaving dead and wounded behind. That evening, the Australians launched a series of determined counterattacks in order to re-establish contact between Slater's Knoll and the forward companies, however, these were turned back.{{sfnp|Tanaka|1980|p=284}}{{sfnp|Long|1963|p=162}}\n\n[[File:Battle of Slaters knoll 1942 s.jpg|220px|thumb|right|Location of the Battle of Slater's Knoll in south west Bougainville.|alt=A location map, depicting a portion of the western coast of Bougainville, showing the relative position of Slater's Knoll, the Buin Road and several other key locations]]\n\nMeanwhile, the Japanese 23rd Infantry Regiment, which had advanced on the right flank from Barara{{#tag:ref| The Japanese name for this location was \"Bara Bara\".{{sfnp|Tanaka|1980|p=284}}|group=Note}} attempted to move on Slater's Knoll from the north. Finding its way blocked by wire obstacles and lacking the equipment necessary to remove them, it was forced to halt its advance and cover the flank of Colonel Toyoji Muta's 13th Infantry Regiment, which was attempting to launch an assault across the Puriata.{{sfnp|Tanaka|1980|p=284}} At this point, the river was about {{convert|100|m|yd|abbr=on}} across and {{convert|1|m|ft|abbr=on}} deep, while the opposite bank was about {{convert|1|m|ft|abbr=on}} high. The crossing began at 03:00 on 1 April, and the three battalions made heavy work of it. When they were halfway across, the two forward battalions were spotted by the Australians in the moonlight and engaged with machine gun and rifle fire.{{sfnp|Tanaka|1980|p=284}} The Japanese quickly deployed and attempted to launch an attack; however, in the confusion the 1st Battalion, 23rd Infantry Regiment was cut off from the rest of the assault force. As daylight came, the Australians were able to call down mortar fire on the Japanese, causing considerable casualties. Running low on ammunition and having suffered considerable losses, the 23rd Infantry were forced to withdraw. The 1st Battalion  remained cut off until the evening of 1 April, when it was able to re-establish contact with the other two battalions and report to the divisional commander that the attack had been unsuccessful.{{sfnp|Tanaka|1980|pp=284\u2013285}}\n\n===Lull in the battle and secondary attack===\nOn 2 April, the Japanese divisional commander, Akinaga, called the 13th and 23rd Infantry Regiments back across the Puriata, to a position south-west of the Pain feature.{{sfnp|Tanaka|1980|p=285}} At this point, the decision was made to launch a fresh attack aimed at taking Slater's Knoll and eliminating the Australian forces in the area surrounding the Puriata ford.{{sfnp|Long|1963|p=164}} The attack was scheduled for 5 April, and over the course of the following three days, contact was minimal. In this time, there were a few minor skirmishes, and small groups of Japanese were seen by the Australians around Barara, Slater's Knoll and Mosigetta. As further intelligence reports came in, it became clear to the Australian commanders that the Japanese were about to deliver the main attack.{{sfnp|Long|1963|p=162}}\n\nOn the night of 4/5 April, the Japanese heavily shelled the Australian artillery battery, while communications between brigade headquarters and the 25th Infantry Battalion headquarters were severed, as were the lines from the 25th Infantry Battalion's headquarters to its forward companies. Suspecting that the attack was about to commence, runners were sent and the men defending Slater's Knoll, now consisting of a force of only 129 men from 'B' Company, stood-to.{{sfnp|Maitland|1999|p=121}}{{sfnp|Long|1963|p=162}}\n\nAt 05:00 on 5 April, the Japanese launched an attack from the north. This was followed almost simultaneously by a stronger attack from the south-west.{{sfnp|Long|1963|pp=162\u2013163}} For the next 80 minutes, 900\u20131,100 Japanese from the 13th and 23rd Infantry Regiments attacked the small Australian force in waves.{{sfnp|Tanaka|1980|p=285}}{{sfnp|Watt|2001|pp=226\u2013229}} They overwhelmed the Australian forward positions, but finding their way blocked by wire obstacles and lacking any equipment to deal with them the Japanese attack stalled.{{sfnp|Tanaka|1980|p=285}} Quickly, the situation was turned back in favour of the Australians, and the Japanese were cut down by heavy defensive artillery fire and by well-sited machine guns.{{sfnp|Watt|2001|pp=226\u2013229}} A further attack was launched by a smaller force along the Buin Road and aimed at two of the forward companies positioned there. This attack was beaten back also. After regrouping, the surviving members of the 13th Infantry Regiment began preparing for a final charge, determined to fight to the last man. Their commander, Muta, in a final act of defiance wrapped his unit's banner around his waist and armed himself with a grenade with which to blow himself up during the assault. Elsewhere, the remaining officers of the 23rd Infantry made a pact to hurl themselves against the Australians one last time in a suicidal charge. Nevertheless, Akinaga, realising that further assaults were futile finally dispatched the order to cancel the attack.{{sfnp|James|2012|p=211}}  At around 08:30, the Australians realised that the Japanese had decided that they had had enough. Just after midday, two tanks were dispatched from the 'B' Echelon perimeter, escorted by a company from the 61st Infantry Battalion, arriving on the knoll by 13:45 where they were used as fire support as the Australians began to carry out mopping up operations, flushing out small groups of survivors all around the position.{{sfnp|Long|1963|p=163}}\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe day after the final Japanese assault on the knoll, 292 dead Japanese were counted around 'B' Company's perimeter.{{sfnp|Long|1963|p=163}}{{sfnp|Coulthard-Clark|1998|p=250}} In total, over the course of the battle, the Australians counted 620 Japanese killed, and estimated that another 1,000 had probably been wounded.{{sfnp|Coulthard-Clark|1998|p=251}} Information obtained from captured Japanese clarified that the Australians had come up against a force of at least 2,400 troops.{{sfnp|Belham|Denham|2009|p=140}} The commander of the 23rd Infantry Regiment, Lieutenant Colonel Kawano Koji, was among the dead, as was a senior divisional staff officer, Lieutenant Colonel Honda Matsuo.{{sfnp|James|2012|p=208}} Four wounded Japanese were also taken [[prisoner of war]]. Casualties for the Australians included 10 officers and 179 other ranks killed or wounded, while there had been a further 81 Australians evacuated due to non-combat related issues.{{sfnp|Long|1963|pp=163\u2013164}} Wartime Japanese casualty estimates vary from these figures, though, claiming to have killed 1,800 Australians, while placing their own losses at 280 killed and 320 wounded. Long argues that these figures are problematic, as based upon the same report, the Japanese believed that there were only 400 Australians in the region during the battle, and yet they claimed to have killed almost five times that number.{{sfnp|Long|1963|p=164}}\n\n[[File:Japanese dead after the Battle of Slater's Knoll.jpg|thumb|left|Japanese killed during the final assault on Slater's Knoll are buried the day after the battle|alt=Soldiers burying dead in a large pit]]\n\nThe result of the battle had a profound effect on the Japanese commanders. According to James, Kanda had been \"so certain of victory...[he]...had not developed any plans for...subsequent activities\".{{sfnp|James|2012|p=218}} Nevertheless, after the battle, the Japanese forces in the area pulled back to the [[Hongorai River]], where they were reorganised due to the heavy losses, with several infantry, engineer and artillery units being amalgamated. Lacking food, suffering the effects of disease, and isolated from home, morale amongst the Japanese troops fell heavily, with many realising that the war was lost. There was an increase in desertions at this time, although the vast majority continued to fight, if only because they were under orders to do so.{{sfnp|James|2012|pp=210\u2013219}}\n\nOperationally, the battle proved to the Australian high command how effective armour could be when used in close co-operation with infantry and in protecting the lines of communication.{{sfnp|Long|1963|p=164}} The use of [[Universal carrier|machine gun carriers]] to carry out the wounded had also been quite effective.{{sfnp|Belham|Denham|2009|p=140}} While the Japanese soldiers and officers on the ground fought bravely, continuing the assault even when it was clear it had failed, ultimately the battle proved to be a decisive Australian victory; however, James notes that poor planning and unreliable communications had also contributed to the result.{{sfnp|James|2012|p=210}} Long goes on to argue that if the Japanese commander had been more flexible in his tactics, the result might have been different. The Australian right flank had been vulnerable, but Akinaga did not exploit this opportunity.{{sfnp|Long|1963|p=164}}\n\nThere were tactical deficiencies as well, particularly the predictability of cutting Australian signals lines just before an attack and bunching together in tight groups during an assault, allowing the Australians to take full toll with their machine guns. The Australian commander of the 25th Infantry Battalion, McKinna, had spread his companies out effectively and went forward to direct the fighting at several points. Fields of fire had been cleared, perimeters set and patrolling had been maintained.{{sfnp|James|2012|pp=211\u2013212}} Nevertheless, the Australians had also failed to seize opportunities as they arose, for after the battle they did not follow up their success immediately. After the failure of the final assault, the Japanese had possessed no forces in the immediate vicinity that would have been capable of resisting any follow up forces that the Australians might have been able to bring up and it is possible that an advance could have been carried all the way to the Hongorai River. As it was, however, the Australian line of supply was stretched and it was necessary for a pause before the advance could continue in earnest.{{sfnp|Long|1963|p=165}}\n\nIn the days immediately after the battle, the Australians continued to carry out patrolling operations around the knoll. On 7 April, a patrol from the 9th Infantry Battalion clashed with a Japanese force of about 30 men and in the ensuing engagement four Japanese were killed, while a patrol from the 61st Infantry Battalion on 8 April killed another five. On 13 April, the order was given that the 7th Brigade would be gradually withdrawn and relieved by the [[15th Brigade (Australia)|15th]].{{sfnp|Long|1963|p=166}}{{sfnp|Watt|2001|p=231}} Shortly afterwards, the [[58th/59th Battalion (Australia)|58th/59th Infantry Battalion]] replaced the 25th in occupation of the knoll, while the [[24th Battalion (Australia)|24th Infantry Battalion]] resumed the advance along the Buin Road on 17 April,{{sfnp|Keogh|1965|p=419}} subsequently taking part in the [[Battle of the Hongorai River|fighting along the Hongorai River]].{{sfnp|Maitland|1999|p=122}} The 9th Infantry Battalion, however, was not withdrawn immediately, and remained in the northern area until it handed over to the [[57th/60th Battalion (Australia)|57th/60th Infantry Battalion]] in early May. The fighting on Bougainville continued throughout April as the Japanese resisted the Australian advance and went on until July when the fighting petered out due to heavy rain and flooding.{{sfnp|Maitland|1999|pp=122\u2013123}}\n\nAfter the war, the [[battle honour]] of \"Slater's Knoll\" was awarded to the 25th Infantry Battalion and the 2/4th Armoured Regiment. Neither the 9th or 61st Infantry Battalions were similarly credited, although according to Gordon Maitland there seems to be no explanation as to why.{{sfnp|Maitland|1999|p=145}} For his actions during the attack on the Japanese pillboxes on 22 March, Rattey later received the [[Victoria Cross]]. Initially, his battalion commander, McKinna, had nominated him for the lesser [[Distinguished Conduct Medal]], but on review by Field, the brigade commander, the nomination was elevated.

of the government of [[El Salvador]], created on March 28, 2011 as an initiative of the then First Lady [[Vanda Pignato]]. It consists on offering aid to victims of [[violence against women]], as well provide access to women's healthcare services, [[financial advice]], and career training. The six Ciudad Mujer centers, located throughout the country, offer services from 15 Salvadoran government agencies in one location. These include job training and financial loans to offer a chance for [[economic independence]]. Ciudad Mujer also provides healthcare services, including [[forensic]] laboratories and legal aid for victims of sexual assault, reproductive services, [[neonatal]] care and breast cancer prevention. An estimated 603,000 women have utilized Ciudad Mujer, as of November 2014.\n\nThe project was placed under the responsibility of the Secretariat for Social Inclusion, under the responsability of the First Lady.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ciudadmujer.gob.sv/|title=\u00bfQu\u00e9 es Ciudad Mujer? \u2014 Ciudad Mujer|last=|first=|date=|website=Ciudad Mujer|language=es|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-06}}</ref>\n\nHowever, after the President [[Nayib Bukele]]'s takeover in 2019, Ciudad Mujer became part of the new Ministry of Local Development, since the secretariat under whose charge it had been placed had been abolished.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.laprensagrafica.com/elsalvador/Ciudad-Mujer-pasa-a-ser-parte-de-Ministerio-de-Desarrollo-Local-20190604-0305.html|title=Ciudad Mujer pasa a ser parte de Ministerio de Desarrollo Local|last=|first=|date=4 June 2019|website=[[La Prensa Gr\u00e1fica]]|language=es-ES|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-06}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nCiudad Mujer is based on the idea of unifying all State institutions that provide services to women in the same space. The integration of these services under a single roof reduces the transaction costs of women users and allows their quality to be substantially increased.\n\nThe model aims to promote autonomy in its three dimensions: physical, economic and citizen participation of women through labor participation, facilitate comprehensive health care for women, with an emphasis on sexual and reproductive health, strengthen actions to prevent [[violence against women]] and provide childcare to children while their mothers use the services.\n\nSix the centers have been opened to low income areas across El Salvador.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite news|last=Moloney|first=Anastasia|url=https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-women-cities-el-salvador-idUKKCN0J81SW20141124|title=Women City centres bring hope to El Salvador's abused women|date=2014-11-24|work=[[Reuters]]|access-date=2020-04-06|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191012120058/https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-women-cities-el-salvador-idUKKCN0J81SW20141124|archive-date=2020-04-06|language=en}}</ref> She overcame opposition against the plan from several sectors of Salvadoran society, which included politicians, [[evangelical Christian]] groups, and the [[Roman Catholicism in El Salvador|Roman Catholic Church]], to launch Ciudad Mujer.<ref name=\":1\" /> Ciudad Mujer, which had provided healthcare, legal and healthcare services to 603,000 women by November 2014, have won praise both within El Salvador and internationally.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nAfter Col\u00f3n headquarter, who simply adapted an existing complex, the construction of the six new centers was financed with a loan of US $20 million agreed with the [[Inter-American Development Bank]] (IDB).<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.iadb.org/es/noticias/el-gobierno-de-el-salvador-inaugura-primera-sede-de-ciudad-mujer-en-el-municipio-de-colon|title=El gobierno de El Salvador inaugura primera sede de Ciudad Mujer en el municipio de Col\u00f3n {{!}} IADB|last=|first=|date=28 March 2011|website=[[Inter-American Development Bank]]|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-06}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ciudadmujer.gob.sv/bid-y-gobierno-de-el-salvador-firman-prstamo-para-seis-sedes-de-ciudad-mujer/|title=BID y Gobierno de El Salvador firman pr\u00e9stamo para seis sedes de Ciudad Mujer|last=|first=|date=2011-06-22|website=Ciudad Mujer|language=es|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190719062532/http://www.ciudadmujer.gob.sv/bid-y-gobierno-de-el-salvador-firman-prstamo-para-seis-sedes-de-ciudad-mujer/|archive-date=2020-04-05|access-date=2020-04-06}}</ref>\n\nIt currently groups 18 state institutions in the same space.
