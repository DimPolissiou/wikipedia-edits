En route, d'Orves changed his objectif from [[Trincomalee]] to [[Madras]].<ref name=cunat97>Cunat, p.97</ref><ref group=Note>Present-day [[Chennai]]</ref> On 19 January, ''S\u00e9v\u00e8re'' detected a strange sail, and d'Orves detached ''H\u00e9ros'' and ''Art\u00e9sien'' to investigate. Suffren closed in, making signals according to tables captured at Porto Praya on the East Indiaman [[Hinchinbrooke (1780 ship)|''Hinchinbrooke'']], until the ship made signals that he was unable to answer. A chase ensued, and with the night Suffren abandonned the pursuit to rejoin the fleet. On 21, the fleet encountered the same ship again, and again detached ''H\u00e9ros'', ''Art\u00e9sien'' and ''Vengeur'', but this time with other ships deploying as to ensure communication between the pursuers and the main body of the fleet, allowing Suffren to press on his chase. Suffren caught up with his quarry on 22 around noon and forced her to surrender. She was the 50-gun [[HMS Hannibal (1779)|HMS ''Hannibal'']], under Captain Christy, which the French pressed into their service as ''Petit Annibal''.<ref name=cunat99>Cunat, p.99</ref>\n\n==== Battle of Sadras ====\n{{Main|Battle of Sadras}}\nIn the following days, d'Orves' failing health deteriorated to the point where he was not fit for duty, and he delegated command to Suffren.<ref name=cunat100>Cunat, p.100</ref> The French intended to surprise the British ships anchored in the roads of Madras. The fleet arrived North of Madras on 5 February 1782, and its light units started praying on coastal merchantmen and capturing cargo of rice.<ref name=cunat101>Cunat, p.101</ref> However, the [[monsoon]] caused strong winds from the South which trapped the French North of Madras, while at the same time favouring the return of Hughes' squadron from Ceylon to Madras.<ref name=cunat102>Cunat, p.102</ref> Upon Hughes' arrival, [[George Macartney, 1st Earl Macartney|Lord Macartney]] warned him of the presence of the French squadron, and Hughes anchored his ships under the protection of [[Fort St. George, India|Fort St. George]] and [[George Town, Chennai|Black Town]]. On 9 February 1782, Hughes received reinforcements with the arrival of a squadron comprising the 64-gun [[HMS Monmouth (1772)|HMS ''Monmouth'']], the [[74-gun]] [[HMS Hero (1759)|''Hero'']], the 50-gun [[HMS Isis (1774)|''Isis'']] and the armed transport ''Manilla'', under [[James Alms]]. \n\nD'Orves died the same day at 1600. Suffren re-appointed his captains to the ships of the squadon: Captain de Lapalli\u00e8re{{refn|Sometimes spelt \"la Palli\u00e8re\"<ref name=cunat104 />|group=Note}} took command of ''Orient'' and [[Chevalier de Villeneuve-Cillart|Cillart]] that of ''S\u00e9v\u00e8re''; Captain [[Justin Bonaventure Morard de Galles|Morard de Galles]], of ''Pourvoyeuse'', and Lieutenant de Ruyter, in temporary command of ''Petit Annibal'', exchanged their positions; Beaulieu went on ''Bellone'';<ref name=cunat103>Cunat, p.103</ref>  Tromelin (the Younger) took on ''Subtile''; and Galifet took ''Sylphide''. General Duchemin transfered from ''Orient'' to ''H\u00e9ros''.<ref name=cunat104>Cunat, p.104</ref>\n\nOn 14 February, usual monsoon wind from the North-East resumed, allowing Suffren's squadron to sail South. In the evening, [[French frigate Fine (1779)|''Fine'']], under Perrier de Salvert, came in view of Madras harbour and Hughes' squadron. Seeing Hugues anchored in a very strong defensive position, Suffren decided to sail off the coast, <ref name=cunat105>Cunat, p.105</ref> but to his surprise, Hugues left the safety of the forts and gave chase.<ref name=cunat106>Cunat, p.106</ref> Suffren deployed a frigate screen to warn his squadron of Hugues' moves, but during the night ''Pourvoyeuse'' drifted away from the fleet due to a navigation error, while  ''Fine'' lost sight of the British ships, and both thus failed to keep Suffren appraised of Hughes's position.<ref name=cunat108>Cunat, p.108</ref> In the morning, signals from ''Fine'' informed Suffren that HMS ''Montmouth'', ''Hero'', ''Isis'', ''Aigle'' and ''Burford'' where approaching the French transports. Suffren rushed with his warships to protect the convoy, and Hughes ordered his ships to regroup and form a [[line of battle]].<ref name=cunat109>Cunat, p.109</ref> In the morning of 17 February, the fleets were about 6 km apart{{refn|one [[League (unit)|League]] and a half<ref name=cunat109 />|group=Note}}, the British forming a line and had captured ''Lawriston'', while the French were scattered due to an error in interpreting night signals. Suffren formed a line without consideration for the order of battle,<ref name=cunat111>Cunat, p.111</ref> and at 1500 he closed in within gun range, starting the [[Battle of Sadras]].\n\nSuffren sustained about 30 men killed and 100 wounded,<ref name=cunat115>Cunat, p.115</ref> and light damage to his riggings.<ref name=cunat116>Cunat, p.116</ref> At 1900 he broke contact.<ref name=cunat115 />\n\n==== Battle of Providien ====\n{{Main|Battle of Providien}}\nSuffren returned to [[Pondich\u00e9ry]], where he arrived on 19 February 1782 and learned that the British squadron was heading for [[Trincomalee]]. After consulting [[Hyder Ali]], he decided not to land his troops in Pondich\u00e9ry, and rather to head for [[Parangipettai|Porto Nove]], where he arrived on 23 February. <ref name=hennequin299>Hennequin, p.299</ref> Hyder Ali despatched [[Andr\u00e9 Piveron de Morlat]], the French ambassador, to act as an intermediary between Suffren and himself, along with two of his officiers. Suffren negotiated an agreement that French troops would retain their own command; that a 4,000-man cavalry and 6,000-man infantry force would reinforce them; and that they be paid 24 [[Lakh]] rupee a year.<ref name=hennequin302>Hennequin, p.302</ref> Suffren landed his troops at Porto Nove, and departed on 23 March to search for the British fleet.\n\nOn 10 April, the two fleet came into view, and they spent two days in manoeuvers, trying to gain an advantage on the other.<ref name=hennequin302 /> In the morning, ''Fine'' captured a British courier and managed to retrieve the despatches that her captain had thrown overboard, revealing British plans to expel the Dutch from Ceylon.<ref name=cunat127>Cunat, p. 127</ref>   On 12, the [[Battle of Providien]] broke out, leaving both squadrons damaged. Suffren retreated to the safety of the Dutch forts of [[Batticaloa|Batacalo]] to repair, and tend to those members of his crews who were wounded or suffered from scurvy.<ref name=hennequin302 />\n\n==== Battle of Negapatam ====\n{{Main|Battle of Negapatam (1782)}}\nOn 3 June, Suffren departed Batacalo and sailed to [[Cuddalore]], where he received letters from Hyder Ali requesting that he lay siege to [[Nagapattinam]]. The French troops reembarked on their transports, when ''Bellone'', which had been left to patrol, came with news that Hughes' squadron was at Nagapattinam. Suffren ordered an immediate departure and found the British ships anchored when he arrived on 6 July 1782.<ref name=Hennequin303>Hennequin, p.303</ref> Before the battle, Suffren despatched [[French frigate Pourvoyeuse (1772)|''Pourvoyeuse'']] to [[Malacca]], [[HMS Resolution (1771)|''R\u00e9solution'']] to [[Manila]], and [[Fortitude (1780 EIC ship)|''Fortitude'']] and [[Yarmouth (1782 ship)|''Yarmouth'']] to Isle de France, to purchase spare [[Spar (sailing)|spars]], food and ammunition to resupply his fleet. He furtermore kept [[French corvette Sylphide (1763)|''Sylphide'']] and [[French corvette Diligent (1781)|''Diligent'']] handy to bring news of the outcome of the battle to Isle de France.<ref name=cunat164>Cunat, p.164</ref>\n\nThe [[Battle of Negapatam (1782)|Battle of Negapatam]] ensued. The two fleet exchanged fire to over 4 hours, until Hughes retreated.<ref name=Hennequin303 /> During the battle,  Captain [[Chevalier de Villeneuve-Cillart|Cillart]],<ref name=threedeck-cillart>{{cite web |title=de Cillart (Chevalier de Cillart) |url=https://threedecks.org/index.php?display_type=show_crewman&id=38982 |website=Three Deck's Forum}}</ref>{{refn|Also known as Villeneuve-Cilart <ref name=threedeck-cillart />|group=Note}} captain of ''S\u00e9v\u00e8re'', panicked and [[Striking the colors|struck his colours]] but one of the officers, named Dieu and Kerlero de Rosbo,<ref name=roche414>Roche, p.414</ref> refused to surrender and resumed firing.

The next day, a 500-man cavalry troop under General Ghulam Ali Khan escorted Suffren, six of his captains and several officers to the encampment of Hyder Ali's army for a meeting with him.<ref name=Hennequin306 /> Suffren announced that Bussy-Castelnau had arrived to Isle de France with 6 ships of the line, 2 frigates and transports carrying 5,000 soldiers. He also informed Hyder Ali that a French frigate had intercepted a British schooner carrying Colonal Horn to Nagapattinam. Hyder Ali responded with luxurious gifts to Suffren and his officers, or with gifts represented by their equivalent value in rupees. He then ajourned the meeting until the next day.<ref name=Hennequin308>Hennequin, p.308</ref>{{refn|Suffren received 10,000 rupees symbolising the gift of an elephant, which would have been inconvenient on ''H\u00e9ros''; his officers received 1,000 symbolising horses, for the same reason.<ref name=Hennequin308 />|group=Note}}\n\nOn 27, Hyder Ali invited Suffren and Piveron to a private dinner, with European-style seating in deference to his guests.<ref name=Hennequin309>Hennequin, p.309</ref>{{refn|The previous day, Suffren, who was overweight, had suffered from the Indian-style seating and Hyder Ali had graciously bent the etiquette to accomodate him.<ref name=Hennequin308 />|group=Note}} Suffren reported on the battles against Hughes, and they reviewed plans of operations against the British. Hyder Ali was especially concerned by British advance on the [[Malabar Coast]] and the risk that the [[Maratha Empire]] would switch sides, ally with the British and start a war with Mysore.{{refn|The [[Maratha\u2013Mysore War]] was to start three years later.|group=Note}}\n\nMeanwhile, the French squadron was effecting repairs, especially to its rigging, and ''Pourvoyeuse'' sailed to [[Malacca]] to pick up [[Spar (sailing)|spars]].<ref name=Hennequin311>Hennequin, p.311</ref> In early August, Suffren learnt that the British fleet had departed Nagapattinam and was embarking troops in Madras, bound for an unknown destination. Suffren departed at once for [[Tharangambadi]] in the hope of undercovering the British plans. Failing to do so, he sailed to Batticaloa, where he arrived on 8 August to find ''Consolante'', arrived from Isle de France three days earlier. From ''Consolante'', Suffren learnt that two French ships of the line escorting 8 transports were anchored at [[Galle]], waiting to join up with him. Suffren had sent a light ship to Trincomalee, which returned announcing that the British ship were not there. Suffren then decided to lay siege to Trincomalee.<ref name=Hennequin311 />\n\nOn 21 August, the two ships of the convoy arrived. Suffren had ammunition from the convoy distributed among his warships to replenish their magazines, and explained his intentions to the captains. <ref name=Hennequin311 /> The same day, the cutter ''L\u00e9zard'' arrived from France, bringing despatches. The letter notably carried official approval of Suffren's conduct at the Battle of Porto Praya, and granted the requests he had made to appoint his officers. Furthermore, a letter from [[Emmanuel de Rohan-Polduc]], [[List of Grand Masters of the Knights Hospitaller|Grand Master of the Knights Hospitaller]], informed him that he was promoted to Bailiff of the [[Sovereign Military Order of Malta]].<ref name=Hennequin312>Hennequin, p.312</ref>\n\nOn 25 August, the fleet set sail and formed a battle line, soon arriving in view of the forts of Trincomalee. 2,000 men quickly landed, with siege artillery, ammunition and three days worth of rations. By 29, the French had completed their siege battery emplacements, and they started bombarding the fort. On 30, at 0900, Suffren sent a message to [[Fort Ostenburg]] to negotiate its capitulation. The British surrendered the fort in exchange for its 1,000-man garrison to be sent to Madras.<ref name=Hennequin312 />\n\nOn 3 September, the British fleet arrived. Suffren reembarked his troops and moved to intercept, leading to the [[Battle of Trincomalee]].<ref name=Hennequin314>Hennequin, p.314</ref> The French line fought desorganised, especially after ''Vengeur'' caught fire and have to distance herself from other ships. The flag of ''H\u00e9ros'' was shot away by British fire and Suffren had new French ensigns hoisted to continue the fight. After one hour and a half, night fell and the battle ended. Suffren was furious at the conduct of his captains, whom he accused of abandonning him.<ref name=Hennequin316>Hennequin, p.316</ref> The next day, the British fleet had disappeared, and Suffren returned to Trincomalee, where he arrived in the evening of 7 September 1782.<ref name=Hennequin317>Hennequin, p.317</ref> \n\n==== Battle of Cuddalore ====\n{{Main|Battle of Cuddalore (1783)}}\nWhen the French squadron arrived at Trincomalee in the evening of 7 September 1782 after the Battle of Trincomalee, its ships were seriously damaged. ''H\u00e9ros'', in particular, was leaking and had lost her foremast and mainmast. The ships anchored to effect repairs, which the crew completed in two weeks. Meanwhile, Suffren received news that Hyder Ali had left Cuddalore with his army to fight in the North, leaving the city vulnerable to a British attack fom Madras. As Cuddalore was a crucial supply depot, it was imperative for Suffren to protect it. Suffren departed Trincomalee on 1 October to reinforce Cuddalore, <ref name=Hennequin317 /> arriving on 4 October. The expected British attack did not happen, and on 12 October, the change in monsoon forced both fleets to shelter in harbour. Hughes anchored at Bombay, <ref name=Hennequin318>Hennequin, p.318</ref> while Suffren chose to sail to [[Aceh]]. By choosing Aceh, Suffren avoided both being driven away from the battlefield as he would have by chosing Isle de France, and the climate of Trincomalee which he feared would be detrimental to his crew.<ref name=Hennequin318>Hennequin, p.318</ref>\n\nThe French squadron left Cuddalore on 15 October 1782 and arrived at Aceh on 1 November. ''Pourvoyeuse'' and ''Bellone'' arrived shortly after with spare parts, and the fleet spent the following weeks tending to the sick and effecting repairs.<ref name=Hennequin319>Hennequin, p.319</ref> After a while, a corvette arrived from Isle de France, bringing news that a 3-ship squadron under [[Antoine de Thomassin de Peynier]] was about to arrive, escorting a convoy ferrying troops and ammunitions, as well as Bussy-Castelnau.<ref name=Hennequin320>Hennequin, p.320</ref>\n\nSuffren's fleet set sail on 20 December to return to Coromandel. On the way, it raided the British colony of [[Ganjam]], destroying a number of merchantmen. On 12 january 1783, the frigate [[HMS Coventry (1757)|HMS ''Coventry'']], unaware of the presence of the French fleet and mistaking its ships for East Indiamen, approached and had to surrender. From the prisoners, Suffren learnt of  Hyder Ali's death. The fleet continued to Cuddalore, arriving there on 1 February.<ref name=Hennequin320 /> Peynier's squadron of 3 ships and 1 frigate arrived shortly afterwards with 30 transports, survivors of a much larger convoy that had lost a number of ships to the elements and to the British. <ref name=Hennequin321>Hennequin, p.321</ref>\n\nWith the return of favourable weather, Suffren expected and feared Hughes' attack, as his own ships were either damaged after long cruises, or had at best only received field repair at Aceh. He therefore quickly landed his troops at Cuddalore and set sail for Trincomalee. Unfavourable winds made progression difficult and as Suffren's squadron entered the bay, ''Fine'' reported 17 sails closing in.<ref name=Hennequin321 /> The French squadron retreated into the safety of Trincomalee and started repairing. <ref name=Hennequin322>Hennequin, p.322</ref>\n\nOn 24 May, Hughes' squadron passed off Trincomalee. A few days later, a ship brought letters from Bussy-Castelnau announcing that Cuddalore was besieged and blockaded.<ref name=Hennequin322 /> Suffren departed Trincomalee on 11 June 1783 and passed off Tharangambadi on 16, when the frigate screen signaled 18 ships in view. Suffren transfered onto the frigate [[French frigate Cl\u00e9op\u00e2tre (1781)|''Cl\u00e9op\u00e2tre'']] to personnally reconnoitre the situation. The two fleets approached each other in the evening manoeuvered without engaging. In the morning, the French found themselves at the entrance of Cuddalore Bay, while the British squadron was further off at sea.<ref name=Hennequin323>Hennequin, p.323</ref> Suffren anchored his ships and spent the night reinforcing his crew with 1,200 soldiers from ashore.<ref name=Hennequin324>Hennequin, p.324</ref> On 18 June, Suffren set sail and the two squadrons chased each other for two days, trying to gain an advantage. Finally, on 20, the two fleets came in contact and engaged, starting the [[Battle of Cuddalore (1783)|Battle of Cuddalore]] at 1530. <ref name=Hennequin324 /> \n\nOn 25, Hughes retreated to Madras,<ref name=Hennequin326>Hennequin, p.326</ref> and on 29, a British frigate came as a cartel,<ref name=Hennequin327>Hennequin, p.327</ref> bringing news of the preliminary agreements to the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] that had been signed on 9 February 1783, and Hughes' offer of a cease-fire. Suffren accepted. On 25 July, the frigate [[French frigate Surveillante (1778)|''Surveillante'']] arrived from Europe with news of the [[Peace of Paris (1783)|Peace of Paris]] and orders to Suffren to return to France, leaving 5 ships under Peynier in the Indian Ocean.<ref name=Hennequin328>Hennequin, p.328</ref>\n\n=== Post-War ===\nWith the war over, both the French fleet under Suffren and the British fleet under Hughes returned to Europe. On his way, Suffren called the Cape of Good Hope, and had stayed there for a few days when Hughes' squadron arrived, with unfavourable winds. [[HMS Exeter (1763)|HMS ''Exeter'']] ran aground,<ref name=cunat338>Cunat, p.338</ref> and both the British and French ships launched their boats to provide assistance.<ref name=Hennequin329>Hennequin, p.329</ref>\n\nSuffren arrived at Toulon on 26 March 1784. Summoned to Versailles, he was received by Navy Minister [[Charles Eug\u00e8ne Gabriel de La Croix|Castrie]] and by Louis XVI, and much celebrated. <ref name=Hennequin329 /> A fourth position of [[Vice-Admiral]] was created especially for Suffren, the decree stipulating that it would be suppressed after his death.<ref name=Hennequin330>Hennequin, p.330</ref>\n\nIn October 1787, with the implementation of the [[Eden Agreement]], tensions again flared up between France and England, and it was feared that a new conflict was looming. As a precaution, Louix XVI ordered the Brest squadron be readied, and he appointed Suffren to command it, leaving him the choice of his captains. As he prepared for the journey to Brest, Suffren's health suddenly declined. He died in Paris on 8 December 1788.<ref name=Hennequin331>Hennequin, p.331</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n=== Assessment ===\nSuffren was generally recognised as an able commander.

In the evening, [[French frigate Fine (1779)|''Fine'']], under Perrier de Salvert, came in view of Madras harbour and Hughes' squadron. Seeing Hugues anchored in a very strong defensive position, Suffren decided to sail off the coast, <ref name=cunat105>Cunat, p.105</ref> but to his surprise, Hugues left the safety of the forts and gave chase.<ref name=cunat106>Cunat, p.106</ref> Suffren deployed a frigate screen to warn his squadron of Hugues' moves, but during the night ''Pourvoyeuse'' drifted away from the fleet due to a navigation error, while  ''Fine'' lost sight of the British ships, and both thus failed to keep Suffren appraised of Hughes's position.<ref name=cunat108>Cunat, p.108</ref> In the morning, signals from ''Fine'' informed Suffren that HMS ''Montmouth'', ''Hero'', ''Isis'', ''Aigle'' and ''Burford'' where approaching the French transports.

Hyder Ali was especially concerned by British advance on the [[Malabar Coast]] and the risk that the [[Maratha Empire]] would switch sides, ally with the British and start a war with Mysore.{{refn|The [[Maratha\u2013Mysore War]] was to start three years later.|group=Note}}\n\nMeanwhile, the French squadron was effecting repairs, especially to its rigging, and ''Pourvoyeuse'' sailed to [[Malacca]] to pick up [[Spar (sailing)|spars]].<ref name=Hennequin311>Hennequin, p.311</ref> In early August, Suffren learnt that the British fleet had departed Nagapattinam and was embarking troops in Madras, bound for an unknown destination. Suffren departed at once for [[Tharangambadi]] in the hope of undercovering the British plans. Failing to do so, he sailed to Batticaloa, where he arrived on 8 August to find ''Consolante'', arrived from Isle de France three days earlier. From ''Consolante'', Suffren learnt that two French ships of the line escorting 8 transports were anchored at [[Galle]], waiting to join up with him. Suffren had sent a light ship to Trincomalee, which returned announcing that the British ship were not there. Suffren then decided to lay siege to Trincomalee.<ref name=Hennequin311 />\n\nOn 21 August, the two ships of the convoy arrived. Suffren had ammunition from the convoy distributed among his warships to replenish their magazines, and explained his intentions to the captains. <ref name=Hennequin311 /> The same day, the cutter ''L\u00e9zard'' arrived from France, bringing despatches. The letter notably carried official approval of Suffren's conduct at the Battle of Porto Praya, and granted the requests he had made to appoint his officers. Furthermore, a letter from [[Emmanuel de Rohan-Polduc]], [[List of Grand Masters of the Knights Hospitaller|Grand Master of the Knights Hospitaller]], informed him that he was promoted to Bailiff of the [[Sovereign Military Order of Malta]].<ref name=Hennequin312>Hennequin, p.312</ref>\n\nOn 25 August, the fleet set sail and formed a battle line, soon arriving in view of the forts of Trincomalee. 2,000 men quickly landed, with siege artillery, ammunition and three days worth of rations. By 29, the French had completed their siege battery emplacements, and they started bombarding the fort. On 30, at 0900, Suffren sent a message to [[Fort Ostenburg]] to negotiate its capitulation. The British surrendered the fort in exchange for its 1,000-man garrison to be sent to Madras.<ref name=Hennequin312 />\n\nOn 3 September, the British fleet arrived.

The flag of ''H\u00e9ros'' was shot away by British fire and Suffren had new French ensigns hoisted to continue the fight. After one hour and a half, night fell and the battle ended. Suffren was furious at the conduct of his captains, whom he accused of abandonning him.<ref name=Hennequin316>Hennequin, p.316</ref> The next day, the British fleet had disappeared, and Suffren returned to Trincomalee, where he arrived in the evening of 7 September 1782.<ref name=Hennequin317>Hennequin, p.317</ref> \n\n==== Battle of Cuddalore ====\n{{Main|Battle of Cuddalore (1783)}}\nWhen the French squadron arrived at Trincomalee in the evening of 7 September 1782 after the Battle of Trincomalee, its ships were seriously damaged. ''H\u00e9ros'', in particular, was leaking and had lost her foremast and mainmast. The ships anchored to effect repairs, which the crew completed in two weeks. Meanwhile, Suffren received news that Hyder Ali had left Cuddalore with his army to fight in the North, leaving the city vulnerable to a British attack fom Madras. As Cuddalore was a crucial supply depot, it was imperative for Suffren to protect it. Suffren departed Trincomalee on 1 October to reinforce Cuddalore, <ref name=Hennequin317 /> arriving on 4 October. The expected British attack did not happen, and on 12 October, the change in monsoon forced both fleets to shelter in harbour. Hughes anchored at Bombay, <ref name=Hennequin318>Hennequin, p.318</ref> while Suffren chose to sail to [[Aceh]]. By choosing Aceh, Suffren avoided both being driven away from the battlefield as he would have by chosing Isle de France, and the climate of Trincomalee which he feared would be detrimental to his crew.<ref name=Hennequin318>Hennequin, p.318</ref>\n\nThe French squadron left Cuddalore on 15 October 1782 and arrived at Aceh on 1 November. ''Pourvoyeuse'' and ''Bellone'' arrived shortly after with spare parts, and the fleet spent the following weeks tending to the sick and effecting repairs.<ref name=Hennequin319>Hennequin, p.319</ref> After a while, a corvette arrived from Isle de France, bringing news that a 3-ship squadron under [[Antoine de Thomassin de Peynier]] was about to arrive, escorting a convoy ferrying troops and ammunitions, as well as Bussy-Castelnau.<ref name=Hennequin320>Hennequin, p.320</ref>\n\nSuffren's fleet set sail on 20 December to return to Coromandel. On the way, it raided the British colony of [[Ganjam]], destroying a number of merchantmen. On 12 january 1783, the frigate [[HMS Coventry (1757)|HMS ''Coventry'']], unaware of the presence of the French fleet and mistaking its ships for East Indiamen, approached and had to surrender. From the prisoners, Suffren learnt of  Hyder Ali's death. The fleet continued to Cuddalore, arriving there on 1 February.<ref name=Hennequin320 /> Peynier's squadron of 3 ships and 1 frigate arrived shortly afterwards with 30 transports, survivors of a much larger convoy that had lost a number of ships to the elements and to the British. <ref name=Hennequin321>Hennequin, p.321</ref>\n\nWith the return of favourable weather, Suffren expected and feared Hughes' attack, as his own ships were either damaged after long cruises, or had at best only received field repair at Aceh. He therefore quickly landed his troops at Cuddalore and set sail for Trincomalee. Unfavourable winds made progression difficult and as Suffren's squadron entered the bay, ''Fine'' reported 17 sails closing in.<ref name=Hennequin321 /> The French squadron retreated into the safety of Trincomalee and started repairing. <ref name=Hennequin322>Hennequin, p.322</ref>\n\nOn 24 May, Hughes' squadron passed off Trincomalee. A few days later, a ship brought letters from Bussy-Castelnau announcing that Cuddalore was besieged and blockaded.<ref name=Hennequin322 /> Suffren departed Trincomalee on 11 June 1783 and passed off Tharangambadi on 16, when the frigate screen signaled 18 ships in view. Suffren transfered onto the frigate [[French frigate Cl\u00e9op\u00e2tre (1781)|''Cl\u00e9op\u00e2tre'']] to personnally reconnoitre the situation. The two fleets approached each other in the evening manoeuvered without engaging. In the morning, the French found themselves at the entrance of Cuddalore Bay, while the British squadron was further off at sea.<ref name=Hennequin323>Hennequin, p.323</ref> Suffren anchored his ships and spent the night reinforcing his crew with 1,200 soldiers from ashore.<ref name=Hennequin324>Hennequin, p.324</ref> On 18 June, Suffren set sail and the two squadrons chased each other for two days, trying to gain an advantage. Finally, on 20, the two fleets came in contact and engaged, starting the [[Battle of Cuddalore (1783)|Battle of Cuddalore]] at 1530. <ref name=Hennequin324 /> \n\nOn 25, Hughes retreated to Madras,<ref name=Hennequin326>Hennequin, p.326</ref> and on 29, a British frigate came as a cartel,<ref name=Hennequin327>Hennequin, p.327</ref> bringing news of the preliminary agreements to the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] that had been signed on 9 February 1783, and Hughes' offer of a cease-fire. Suffren accepted. On 25 July, the frigate [[French frigate Surveillante (1778)|''Surveillante'']] arrived from Europe with news of the [[Peace of Paris (1783)|Peace of Paris]] and orders to Suffren to return to France, leaving 5 ships under Peynier in the Indian Ocean.<ref name=Hennequin328>Hennequin, p.328</ref>\n\n=== Post-War ===\nWith the war over, both the French fleet under Suffren and the British fleet under Hughes returned to Europe. On his way, Suffren called the Cape of Good Hope, and had stayed there for a few days when Hughes' squadron arrived, with unfavourable winds. [[HMS Exeter (1763)|HMS ''Exeter'']] ran aground,<ref name=cunat338>Cunat, p.338</ref> and both the British and French ships launched their boats to provide assistance.<ref name=Hennequin329>Hennequin, p.329</ref>\n\nSuffren arrived at Toulon on 26 March 1784. Summoned to Versailles, he was received by Navy Minister [[Charles Eug\u00e8ne Gabriel de La Croix|Castrie]] and by Louis XVI, and much celebrated. <ref name=Hennequin329 /> A fourth position of [[Vice-Admiral]] was created especially for Suffren, the decree stipulating that it would be suppressed after his death.<ref name=Hennequin330>Hennequin, p.330</ref>\n\nIn October 1787, with the implementation of the [[Eden Agreement]], tensions again flared up between France and England, and it was feared that a new conflict was looming. As a precaution, Louix XVI ordered the Brest squadron be readied, and he appointed Suffren to command it, leaving him the choice of his captains. As he prepared for the journey to Brest, Suffren's health suddenly declined. He died in Paris on 8 December 1788.<ref name=Hennequin331>Hennequin, p.331</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n=== Assessment ===\nSuffren was generally recognised as an able commander. The [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Eleventh Edition|''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica'' Eleventh Edition]] called him \"perhaps the ablest sea-commander that France ever produced'.<ref>{{Cite EB1911 |wstitle=Hughes, Sir Edward |volume=13 |page=660}}</ref> In ''[[The Influence of Sea Power upon History]]'', [[Alfred Thayer Mahan|Mahan]] writes:\n\n{{quote|The military situation... demanded first the disabling of the hostile fleet, next the capture of certain strategic ports.

(2017), Research Brief: The Right to Seeds and Intellectual Property Rights}}</ref>, is a comprehensive international agreement in harmony with the [[Convention on Biological Diversity]], which aims at guaranteeing [[food security]] through the [[Conservation ethic|conservation]], exchange and [[sustainable use]] of the world's [[plant genetic resources]] for food and agriculture (PGRFA), the fair and equitable benefit sharing arising from its use, as well as the recognition of [[Farmers' rights|farmers' rights]]. It was signed in 2001 in Madrid, and entered into force on 29 June 2004.\n\n==Main features==\n\n===Participating countries===\nThere are 147 contracting parties to the Plant Treaty (146 [[Sovereign state|Member States]] and 1 [[intergovernmental organization]], the [[European Union]]) as of February 2020.<ref>\nhttp://www.fao.org/plant-treaty/news/en/</ref>\n\n===Farmers' rights===\nThe treaty recognises [[farmers' rights]], subject to national laws to: a) the protection of traditional knowledge relevant to plant genetic resources for food and agriculture; b) the right to equitably participate in sharing benefits arising from the utilisation of plant genetic resources for food and agriculture; and c) the right to participate in [[decision-making|making decisions]], at the national level, on matters related to the conservation and sustainable use of plant genetic resources for food and agriculture. The Treaty establishes the Multilateral System of Access and Benefit-sharing to facilitate plant [[germplasm]] exchanges and benefit sharing through [[Material transfer agreement|Standard Material Transfer Agreement]] (SMTA).\n\nHowever, as Regine Andersen of the farmers' rights project,<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.farmersrights.org/ | title=Farmers' Rights website}}</ref> among others, including [[Olivier De Schutter]], the UN [[Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food]],<ref>http://www.srfood.org/images/stories/pdf/officialreports/20091021_report-ga64_seed-policies-and-the-right-to-food_en.pdf</ref> argue, the interpretation and realisation of farmers' rights is weak and is not the same across all countries. Without a consistent, strong international focus on the realising the rights of farmers who conserve and sustainably use PGRFA to save, use, exchange and sell seeds saved on-farm, genetic variety of crops and related [[agricultural biodiversity]] will suffer.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.inwent.org/ez/articles/169196/index.en.shtml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=4 May 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100419031546/http://www.inwent.org/ez/articles/169196/index.en.shtml |archivedate=19 April 2010  }}</ref> India, for example, includes an interpretation of farmers' rights in its Plant Variety Protection and Farmers' Rights Act, allowing farmers a restricted right to save and sell seed they have produced on-farm as they always have, even if it contains genes from a protected variety.,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.inwent.org/ez/articles/169296/index.en.shtml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=4 May 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100706080544/http://www.inwent.org/ez/articles/169296/index.en.shtml |archivedate=6 July 2010  }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.greenconserve.com/pdfs/2009_2010_annual%20report.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=23 March 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726104832/http://www.greenconserve.com/pdfs/2009_2010_annual%20report.pdf |archivedate=26 July 2011  }}</ref>\n\nIn 2019, the adoption of the [[United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Peasants|United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Peasants and other people working in rural areas]] reaffirmed the farmers' rights contained in the Plant Treaty.\n\n===Multilateral system===\nThe treaty has implemented a Multilateral System (MLS) of access and benefit sharing, among those countries that ratify the treaty, for a list of 64 of some of the most important food and forage crops essential for [[food security]] and interdependence. The genera and species are listed in Annex 1 to the treaty.\n\nThe treaty was negotiated by the [[Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations]] (FAO) [[Commission on Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture]] (CGRFA) and since 2006 has its own Governing Body under the aegis of the FAO.  The Governing Body is the highest organ of the Treaty as established in Article 19. Composed of representatives of all Contracting Parties, its basic function is to promote the full implementation of the Treaty, including the provision of policy guidance on the implementation of the Treaty. The Governing Body elects its Chairperson and Vice-Chairpersons, in conformity with its Rules of Procedure. They are collectively referred to as \"the Bureau\".\n\nSome believe the treaty could be an example of responsible global governance for ensuring that plant genetic resources essential for present and future food security can be kept accessible to all farmers and in the public domain.

With the addition of 'compliance' mechanisms and financial rules, these issues took up most negotiating time in the Governing Body meeting.

A previous voluntary agreement, the [[International Undertaking on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture]] (IU), was adopted in 1983. However, the IU was reliant on the principle of genetic resources being the common heritage of humanity.<ref>Shawn N. Sullivan, 2004. Plant Genetic Resources and the Law: Past, Present, and Future. Plant Physiology May 2004 vol. 135 no. 1 10\u201315. http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/135/1/10.full#sec-2</ref> The [[Convention on Biological Diversity]] (CBD) (1993) brought genetic resources under the jurisdiction and sovereignty of national governments. However, the CBD recognised the special and distinctive nature of agricultural genetic resources: they were international \u2013 crossing countries and continents \u2013 their conservation and sustainable use requires distinctive solutions and they were important internationally for food security. Subsequently, the IU was renegotiated, to bring it in harmony with the CBD, and was renamed as a treaty. An account of the long process to achieve the treaty called ''Negotiating the Seed Treaty'' can be found at [https://web.archive.org/web/20120207110630/http://practicalaction.org/docs/advocacy/negotiatingseedtreatycoupe.pdf].\n\nThe treaty was approved during the FAO Conference (31st Session resolution 3/2001<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/meeting/004/Y2650e/Y2650e01.htm#3 | title=Fao \u2013 C 2001/report}}</ref>) on 3 November 2001, with 116 votes and 2 abstentions (USA and Japan). In accordance with its Article 25, it was opened for signatures until 4 November 2002 by all members of [[FAO]] or any state member of the [[United Nations]] or of the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]]. It was subject to ratification, acceptance or approval (Article 26), by all members.\n\nThe International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture was open to accession a year after adoption and once closed to signatures (Article 27), i.e., on 4 November 2002. 77 countries and the European Union had signed the treaty by that date.\n\nIn accordance with Article 28, the treaty entered into force on the ninetieth day after the deposit of the fortieth instrument of ratification, acceptance, approval or accession, provided that at least twenty instruments of ratification, acceptance, approval or accession have been deposited by Members of FAO. Having reached the required number of instruments in order for the treaty to enter into force (40) on 31 March 2004, on which date 13 instruments (including the European Union) were deposited with the Director-General of FAO, the date of entry into force was on 29 June 2004.\n\n==Discussions and criticism==\nPlant genetic resources are essential to a [[sustainable agriculture]] and [[food security]]. FAO estimates humans have used some 10 000 species for food throughout history. However, only about 120 cultivated species provide around 90% of food requirements and 4 species (Maize, Wheat, Rice and Potatoes) provide about 60% of human dietary energy for the world's population. Of the myriad of varieties of these crops developed by farmers over millennia, which form an important part of [[agricultural biodiversity]], more than 75% have been lost in the past 100 years.\n\nSome fear that corporate financial interests might prevent safeguarding of livelihoods, promotion of food security, biodiversity-rich farming under control of local communities, and implementation of Farmers' Rights.\n\nCritics say many of the central issues are unresolved or open to interpretation. Some of the points raised are:\n\n* to what extent will [[intellectual property rights]] be allowed on genetic resources in the MLS, within treaty rules: some argue an agreement aiming at open access to genetic resources for food and agriculture should not allow restrictive property rights, and the treaty says in Article 12.3.d that ''\"Recipients shall not claim any intellectual property or other rights that limit the facilitated access to the plant genetic resources for food and agriculture, or their genetic parts or components, in the form received from the Multilateral System\"'';\n* to what extent will farmers and communities be allowed to freely use, exchange, sell and breed the [[seed]]s, and what enforcement procedures will be used by national governments to ensure principles of Farmers' Rights will be respected;\n*The mechanism for dispute settlement under the Third Party Beneficiary and the role of FAO.\n*The first group of 11 projects funded by the treaty was announced during the Third Session of the Governing Body in Tunis in June 2009. The projects were funded according to criteria established by the Governing Body including regional balance: 5 from Latin America, 5 from Africa and 1 from Asia.  The ranking of the projects was done by a Group of Experts nominated by the 7 regional representatives of the Bureau and the final approval was done by the Bureau on behalf of the Governing Body.\n* while the whole Brassica family (Cruciferae) including all its sub-species and varieties is in the MLS the total number of food crops and forages and their relatives included in the treaty is very limited. Soya, sugar cane, oil palm and groundnut are among important crops missing from the list in Annex 1.\n\nThe treaty came into force on 29 June 2004, at which time there were more than 54 ratifications by countries. An article prepared on the occasion of the treaty becoming law is posted at [http://www.ukabc.org/itpgrfa29june2004.htm]. From the entry into force, countries that previously signed are allowed to ratify the treaty, while countries that did not sign the treaty before it came into force can also accede to it.  The instrument of ratification has to be deposited with the Director-General of FAO.\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book\n|author1=Moore, G.  |author2=Witold, T. \n| year=2003\n| title=The Explanatory Guide to the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture.

(2017), Research Brief: The Right to Seeds and Intellectual Property Rights}}</ref>, is a comprehensive international agreement in harmony with the [[Convention on Biological Diversity]], which aims at guaranteeing [[food security]] through the [[Conservation ethic|conservation]], exchange and [[sustainable use]] of the world's [[plant genetic resources]] for food and agriculture (PGRFA), the fair and equitable benefit sharing arising from its use, as well as the recognition of [[Farmers' rights|farmers' rights]]. It was signed in 2001 in Madrid, and entered into force on June 29th, 2004.\n\n==Main features==\n\n===Participating countries===\nThere are 147 contracting parties to the Plant Treaty (146 [[Sovereign state|Member States]] and 1 [[intergovernmental organization]], the [[European Union]]) as of February 2020.<ref>\nhttp://www.fao.org/plant-treaty/news/en/</ref>\n\n===Farmers' rights===\nThe treaty recognises [[farmers' rights]], subject to national laws to: a) the protection of traditional knowledge relevant to plant genetic resources for food and agriculture; b) the right to equitably participate in sharing benefits arising from the utilisation of plant genetic resources for food and agriculture; and c) the right to participate in [[decision-making|making decisions]], at the national level, on matters related to the conservation and sustainable use of plant genetic resources for food and agriculture. The Treaty establishes the Multilateral System of Access and Benefit-sharing to facilitate plant [[germplasm]] exchanges and benefit sharing through [[Material transfer agreement|Standard Material Transfer Agreement]] (SMTA).\n\nHowever, as Regine Andersen of the farmers' rights project,<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.farmersrights.org/ | title=Farmers' Rights website}}</ref> among others, including [[Olivier De Schutter]], the UN [[Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food]],<ref>http://www.srfood.org/images/stories/pdf/officialreports/20091021_report-ga64_seed-policies-and-the-right-to-food_en.pdf</ref> argue, the interpretation and realisation of farmers' rights is weak and is not the same across all countries. Without a consistent, strong international focus on the realising the rights of farmers who conserve and sustainably use PGRFA to save, use, exchange and sell seeds saved on-farm, genetic variety of crops and related [[agricultural biodiversity]] will suffer.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.inwent.org/ez/articles/169196/index.en.shtml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=4 May 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100419031546/http://www.inwent.org/ez/articles/169196/index.en.shtml |archivedate=19 April 2010  }}</ref> India, for example, includes an interpretation of farmers' rights in its Plant Variety Protection and Farmers' Rights Act, allowing farmers a restricted right to save and sell seed they have produced on-farm as they always have, even if it contains genes from a protected variety.,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.inwent.org/ez/articles/169296/index.en.shtml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=4 May 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100706080544/http://www.inwent.org/ez/articles/169296/index.en.shtml |archivedate=6 July 2010  }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.greenconserve.com/pdfs/2009_2010_annual%20report.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=23 March 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726104832/http://www.greenconserve.com/pdfs/2009_2010_annual%20report.pdf |archivedate=26 July 2011  }}</ref>\n\nIn 2019, the adoption of the [[United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Peasants|United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Peasants and other people working in rural areas]] reaffirmed the farmers' rights contained in the Plant Treaty.\n\n===Multilateral system===\nThe treaty has implemented a Multilateral System (MLS) of access and benefit sharing, among those countries that ratify the treaty, for a list of 64 of some of the most important food and forage crops essential for [[food security]] and interdependence. The genera and species are listed in Annex 1 to the treaty.\n\nThe treaty was negotiated by the [[Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations]] (FAO) [[Commission on Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture]] (CGRFA) and since 2006 has its own Governing Body under the aegis of the FAO.  The Governing Body is the highest organ of the Treaty as established in Article 19. Composed of representatives of all Contracting Parties, its basic function is to promote the full implementation of the Treaty, including the provision of policy guidance on the implementation of the Treaty. The Governing Body elects its Chairperson and Vice-Chairpersons, in conformity with its Rules of Procedure. They are collectively referred to as \"the Bureau\".\n\nSome believe the treaty could be an example of responsible global governance for ensuring that plant genetic resources essential for present and future food security can be kept accessible to all farmers and in the public domain.

With the addition of 'compliance' mechanisms and financial rules, these issues took up most negotiating time in the Governing Body meeting. The relationship of the Treaty with the CGRFA, the CBD's [[Nagoya Protocol]], the [[Global Crop Diversity Trust]] and [[Bioversity International]] were also included in resolutions.\n* The Fifth Session of the Governing Body was held in Muscat, Oman in September 2013.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.planttreaty.org/content/gb5 | title=International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture\u00a0&#124;\u00a0Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations}}</ref> The session was preceded by two days of regional consultations. The Fifth Session achieved:\n**a resolution on Farmers' Rights (FRs), which renewed the commitment of governments to implement Farmers' Rights;\n**a coded call to [[International Union for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants|UPOV]] and [[WIPO]] to report on their impacts on Farmers' Rights;\n**warm acceptance of the offer by Farmers' Organisations to produce a report for GB6 on the state of implementation of Farmers' Rights;\n**actions designed to improve the sustainable use of Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture, linked to commitments to realise Farmers' Rights;\n**commitments to review and change the multi-lateral Access and Benefit Sharing mechanism (MLS), to prevent pillaging of the System by patents on native traits, for example;\n**significant new voluntary financial contributions from Norway for the Global Crop Diversity Trust and for the benefit sharing fund to support on-farm conservation; \n**acceptance of the distinction between NGOs and Farmers' Organisations and the need to include representatives of farmers' social movements in negotiations;\n**a request to the Secretary to report on relevant discussions that relate to Farmers' Rights within other UN fora including the Committee on World Food Security.

A previous voluntary agreement, the [[International Undertaking on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture]] (IU), was adopted in 1983. However, the IU was reliant on the principle of genetic resources being the common heritage of humanity.<ref>Shawn N. Sullivan, 2004. Plant Genetic Resources and the Law: Past, Present, and Future. Plant Physiology May 2004 vol. 135 no. 1 10\u201315. http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/135/1/10.full#sec-2</ref> The [[Convention on Biological Diversity]] (CBD) (1993) brought genetic resources under the jurisdiction and sovereignty of national governments. However, the CBD recognised the special and distinctive nature of agricultural genetic resources: they were international \u2013 crossing countries and continents \u2013 their conservation and sustainable use requires distinctive solutions and they were important internationally for food security. Subsequently, the IU was renegotiated, to bring it in harmony with the CBD, and was renamed as a treaty. An account of the long process to achieve the treaty called ''Negotiating the Seed Treaty'' can be found at [https://web.archive.org/web/20120207110630/http://practicalaction.org/docs/advocacy/negotiatingseedtreatycoupe.pdf].\n\nThe treaty was approved during the FAO Conference (31st Session resolution 3/2001<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/meeting/004/Y2650e/Y2650e01.htm#3 | title=Fao \u2013 C 2001/report}}</ref>) on 3 November 2001, with 116 votes and 2 abstentions (USA and Japan). In accordance with its Article 25, it was opened for signatures until 4 November 2002 by all members of [[FAO]] or any state member of the [[United Nations]] or of the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]]. It was subject to ratification, acceptance or approval (Article 26), by all members.\n\nThe International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture was open to accession a year after adoption and once closed to signatures (Article 27), i.e., on 4 November 2002. 77 countries and the European Union had signed the treaty by that date.\n\nIn accordance with Article 28, the treaty entered into force on the ninetieth day after the deposit of the fortieth instrument of ratification, acceptance, approval or accession, provided that at least twenty instruments of ratification, acceptance, approval or accession have been deposited by Members of FAO. Having reached the required number of instruments in order for the treaty to enter into force (40) on 31 March 2004, on which date 13 instruments (including the European Union) were deposited with the Director-General of FAO, the date of entry into force was on 29 June 2004.\n\n==Discussions and criticism==\nPlant genetic resources are essential to a [[sustainable agriculture]] and [[food security]]. FAO estimates humans have used some 10 000 species for food throughout history. However, only about 120 cultivated species provide around 90% of food requirements and 4 species (Maize, Wheat, Rice and Potatoes) provide about 60% of human dietary energy for the world's population. Of the myriad of varieties of these crops developed by farmers over millennia, which form an important part of [[agricultural biodiversity]], more than 75% have been lost in the past 100 years.\n\nSome fear that corporate financial interests might prevent safeguarding of livelihoods, promotion of food security, biodiversity-rich farming under control of local communities, and implementation of Farmers' Rights.\n\nCritics say many of the central issues are unresolved or open to interpretation. Some of the points raised are:\n\n* to what extent will [[intellectual property rights]] be allowed on genetic resources in the MLS, within treaty rules: some argue an agreement aiming at open access to genetic resources for food and agriculture should not allow restrictive property rights, and the treaty says in Article 12.3.d that ''\"Recipients shall not claim any intellectual property or other rights that limit the facilitated access to the plant genetic resources for food and agriculture, or their genetic parts or components, in the form received from the Multilateral System\"'';\n* to what extent will farmers and communities be allowed to freely use, exchange, sell and breed the [[seed]]s, and what enforcement procedures will be used by national governments to ensure principles of Farmers' Rights will be respected;\n*The mechanism for dispute settlement under the Third Party Beneficiary and the role of FAO.\n*The first group of 11 projects funded by the treaty was announced during the Third Session of the Governing Body in Tunis in June 2009. The projects were funded according to criteria established by the Governing Body including regional balance: 5 from Latin America, 5 from Africa and 1 from Asia.  The ranking of the projects was done by a Group of Experts nominated by the 7 regional representatives of the Bureau and the final approval was done by the Bureau on behalf of the Governing Body.\n* while the whole Brassica family (Cruciferae) including all its sub-species and varieties is in the MLS the total number of food crops and forages and their relatives included in the treaty is very limited. Soya, sugar cane, oil palm and groundnut are among important crops missing from the list in Annex 1.\n\nThe treaty came into force on 29 June 2004, at which time there were more than 54 ratifications by countries. An article prepared on the occasion of the treaty becoming law is posted at [http://www.ukabc.org/itpgrfa29june2004.htm]. From the entry into force, countries that previously signed are allowed to ratify the treaty, while countries that did not sign the treaty before it came into force can also accede to it.  The instrument of ratification has to be deposited with the Director-General of FAO.\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book\n|author1=Moore, G.  |author2=Witold, T. \n| year=2003\n| title=The Explanatory Guide to the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture.

Mark}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\nAssyria was originally an Akkadian kingdom which evolved in the 25th to 24th centuries BC. The earliest Assyrian kings such as [[Tudiya]] were relatively minor rulers, and after the founding of the [[Akkadian Empire]], which lasted from 2334 BC to 2154 BC, these kings became subject to [[Sargon of Akkad]], who united all the Akkadian- and [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]]-speaking peoples of [[Mesopotamia]] (including the Assyrians) under one rule.\n\nThe urbanised Akkadian-speaking nation of Assyria emerged in the mid 21st century BC, evolving from the dissolution of the [[Akkadian Empire]]. In the Old Assyrian period of the [[Early Bronze Age]], Assyria had been a kingdom of northern Mesopotamia (modern-day northern [[Iraq]]), competing for dominance initially with the [[Hattians]] and [[Hurrians]] of [[Asia Minor]], and the ancient [[Sumero-Akkadian]] \"city states\" such as [[Isin]], [[Ur]] and [[Larsa]], and later with [[Babylonia]] which was founded by [[Amorites]] in 1894 BC, and often under [[Kassites|Kassite]] rule. During the 20th century BC, it established colonies in [[Asia Minor]], and under the 20th century BC King [[Ilushuma]], Assyria conducted many successful raids against the states of the south.\n\nAssyria fell under the control of the Amorite chieftain [[Shamshi-Adad I]] (c. 1809 \u2013 1776 BC), who established a dynasty and was unusually energetic and politically canny, installing his sons as puppet rulers at Mari and Ekallatm.<ref name=colo>[http://www.cemml.colostate.edu/cultural/09476/iraq02-05enl.html \"Neo-Assyria\", Colorado State University]</ref>\nFollowing this it found itself under short periods of [[Babylonia]]n and [[Mitanni]]-[[Hurrian]] domination in the 17th and 15th centuries BC respectively, followed by another period of power from 1365 BC to 1074 BC, that included the reigns of kings such as [[Ashur-uballit I]], [[Tukulti-Ninurta I]] (r. 1244\u20131208 B.C.), and [[Tiglath-Pileser I]].\n\n===Middle Assyrian Empire===\n[[File:Image from page 33 of \"Ancient seals of the Near East\" (1940).jpg|thumb|Middle-Assyrian Empire seal. 1400-1100 BCE.]]\nAshur-uballit extended Assyrian control over the rich farming lands of Nineveh and Arbela to the north.<ref name=met>[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/assy/hd_assy.htm \"Assyria, 1365\u2013609 B.C.\" in Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History Department of Ancient Near Eastern Art, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, (originally published October 2004, last revised April 2010,)]</ref> Tiglath-Pileser controlled the lucrative caravan routes that crossed the fertile crescent from the Mediterranean to the Persian Gulf.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=vXljf8JqmkoC&pg=PA249&lpg=PA249&dq=Adad-nirari+II&source=bl&ots=QxlmhmzlLw&sig=-gHT4AK_1s-SvCi5myCg6J1_9ao&hl=en&sa=X&ei=YUgoVejgDIa0yQSR04HwBA&ved=0CFAQ6AEwDA#v=onepage&q=Adad-nirari%20II&f=false Boardman, John and Edwards I.

The period from 1200 BC to 900 BC was a [[Late Bronze Age collapse|Dark Age]] for the entire [[Near East]], [[North Africa]], [[Caucasus]], [[Mediterranean]] and [[Balkan]] regions, with great upheavals and mass movements of people.

Adad-nirari II and his successors campaigned on an annual basis for part of every year with an exceptionally well-organized army.<ref name=colo/> He subjugated the areas previously under only nominal Assyrian vassalage, conquering and deporting [[Aramaeans|Aramean]] and [[Hurrian]] populations in the north to far-off places. Adad-nirari II then twice attacked and defeated [[Shamash-mudammiq]] of [[Babylonia]], annexing a large area of land north of the [[Diyala River|Diyala]] river and the towns of [[H\u012bt|Hit]] and Zanqu in mid Mesopotamia. He made further gains over Babylonia under [[Nabu-shuma-ukin I]] later in his reign. He was succeeded by [[Tukulti-Ninurta II]] in 891 BC, who further consolidated Assyria's position and expanded northwards into [[Asia Minor]] and the [[Zagros Mountains]] during his short reign.\n\nThe next king, [[Ashurnasirpal II]] (883\u2013859 BC), embarked on a vast [[Assyrian Army|program]] of expansion. During his rule, Assyria recovered much of the territory that it had lost around 1100 BC at the end of the Middle Assyrian period.<ref name=met /> Ashurnasirpal II also campaigned in the [[Zagros Mountains]] in modern [[Iran]], repressing a revolt against Assyrian rule by the [[Lullubi]] and [[Gutians]]. The Assyrians began boasting in their ruthlessness around this time. Ashurnasirpal II also moved his capital to the city of [[Kalhu]] ([[Calah]]/[[Nimrud]]). The palaces, temples and other buildings raised by him bear witness to a considerable development of wealth and art. Ashurnasirpal II introduced  a policy of mass deportation of conquered people, which continued on a greatly increased scale under his son, [[Shalmaneser III]].<ref name=Parpola>{{cite journal |last1=Parpola |first1=Simo |title=National and Ethnic Identity in the Neo-Assyrian Empire and Assyrian Identity in Post-Empire Times |url=http://jaas.org/edocs/v18n2/Parpola-identity_Article%20-Final.pdf |journal=Journal of Assyrian Academic Studies |volume=18 |issue=2 |year=2004}}</ref>\n\n===Shalmaneser III to Adad-nirari III (859\u2013783 BC)===\nAshurnasirpal's son, [[Shalmaneser III]] (859\u2013824 BC), had a long reign of 35 years, in which the capital was converted into an armed camp. Each year the Assyrian armies marched out to campaign. [[Babylon]] was occupied, and Babylonia reduced to vassalage. He fought against [[Urartu]] and marched an army against an alliance of [[Aramaeans|Aramean]] states headed by [[Hadadezer]] of [[Damascus]] and including [[Ahab]], king of [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Israel]], at the [[Battle of Qarqar]] in 853 BC. Despite Shalmaneser's description of 'vanquishing the opposition', it seems that the battle ended in a deadlock, as the Assyrian forces were withdrawn soon afterwards.\n\n[[File:Black_Obelisk_Yehu_in_front_of_Shalmaneser_III.jpg|thumb|upright=2|[[Shalmaneser III]] receiving the tribute of \"Jehu of the people of the land of [[Omri]]\" ({{lang-akk|{{cuneiform|7|\ud808\udd40\ud808\udf11\ud808\udc00 \ud808\ude25 \ud808\udd37\ud808\udf1d\ud808\ude91\ud808\udd3f}}}}), referring to [[Jehu]], king of northern Israel, as depicted on the [[Black Obelisk]], circa 840 BCE.]]\nShalmaneser took the neo [[Neo-Hittite|Hittite]] state of [[Carchemish]] in 849 BC, and in 842 BC, marched an army against [[Hazael]], King of [[Damascus]], besieging the city and forcing tribute, but not taking it. In 841 BC, he also brought under tribute [[Jehu]] of [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Israel]], and the [[Phoenicia]]n states of [[Tyre (Lebanon)|Tyre]], and [[Sidon]].

Twenty seven cities, including [[Assur]], [[Erbil|Arbela]], [[Arrapha]] ([[Kirkuk]]) and other places joined the pretender. The rebellion was not directed primarily against the king, but rather against the provisional governors such as Dayan-Ashur who had assumed disproportionate power. The revolt was quashed with difficulty by [[Shamshi-Adad V]], Shalmaneser's second son, who succeeded him upon his death in 824 BC.\n\nThe long and bitter civil war had allowed the [[Babylonians]] to the south, the [[Medes]], [[Manneans]], the [[Persia]]ns to the north and east, the [[Arameans]], and the Neo-[[Hittites]] in the west to largely shake off Assyrian rule, and [[Shamshi-Adad V]] spent the remainder of his reign reasserting control over those peoples. During this period, [[Urartu]] took the opportunity to reassert its influence on the region. As a result of all these events, Assyria did not expand further during the reign of Shamshi-Adad V. [[Adad-nirari III]] was a boy when succeeding his father in 811 BC, and for five years until 806 BC, his mother, Queen [[Sammuramat]] (also depicted as [[Semiramis]]) ruled as regent in his stead. Despite the numerous legends  regarding this queen, she is mentioned little in Assyrian records of the time.\n\nIn 806 BC, [[Adad-nirari III]] took the reins of power. He invaded the [[Levant]] and subjugated the [[Arameans]], [[Phoenicians]], [[Philistines]], [[Israelites]], Neo-[[Hittites]] and [[Edomites]]. He entered [[Damascus]] and forced tribute upon its king [[Ben-Hadad III]]. He next turned to [[Iran]], and subjugated the [[Persia]]ns, [[Medes]] and [[Manneans]], penetrating as far as the [[Caspian Sea]]. His next targets were the [[Chaldea]]n and [[Shutu|Sutu]] tribes of southeastern Mesopotamia whom he conquered and reduced to vassalage.\n\n===Period of stagnation, 783\u2013745 BC===\n[[File:Cherub on a Neo-Assyrian seal.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Cherub]] on a [[Neo-Assyrian]] seal, ca. 1000-612 BC]]\nAdad-nirari III died prematurely in 783 BC, and this led to a period of true stagnation. [[Shalmaneser IV]] (783\u2013773 BC) seems to have wielded little authority, and a victory over [[Argishti I]], king of [[Urartu]] at [[Til Barsip]], is accredited to a general ('Turtanu') named [[Shamshi-ilu]] who does not even bother to mention his king. Shamshi-ilu also scored victories over the [[Arameans]] and Neo-[[Hittites]], and again, takes personal credit at the expense of his king.\n\n[[Ashur-dan III]] ascended the throne in 772 BC. He proved to be a largely ineffectual ruler who was beset by internal rebellions in the cities of [[Ashur]], [[Arrapkha]], and [[Guzana]]. He failed to make further gains in Babylonia and [[Aram-Naharaim|Aram]] (Syria). His reign was also marred by [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] and an ominous [[Solar Eclipse]]. [[Ashur-nirari V]] became king in 754 BC, but his reign seems to have been one of permanent revolution, and he appears to have barely left his palace in Nineveh before he was deposed by [[Tiglath-Pileser III]] in 745 BC, bringing a resurgence to Assyria.\n\n===Tiglath-Pileser III, 744\u2013727 BC===\n{{main|Tiglath-Pileser III}}\n[[File:Deportation of Jews by Assyrians.svg|thumb|left|350px|Deportation of Israelites by the Assyrian Empire]]\nWhen [[Tiglath-Pileser III]] ascended the throne, Assyria was in the throes of a revolution. [[Civil war]] and [[Infectious disease|pestilence]] were devastating the country, and many of Assyria's most northerly colonies in Asia Minor had been wrested from it by Urartu. In 746 BC, the city of Kalhu joined the rebels, but on the 13th of ''Iyyar'' in the following year, an Assyrian general (Turtanu) named Pulu seized the crown under the name of [[Tiglath-Pileser III]], and made sweeping changes to the Assyrian government, considerably improving its efficiency and security.\n\nThe conquered provinces were organized under an elaborate bureaucracy, with the king at the head\u2014each district paying a fixed tribute and providing a military contingent. The Assyrian forces at this time became a professional standing army. Assyrian policy was henceforth directed toward reducing the whole civilized world into a single empire, throwing its trade and wealth into Assyrian hands. These changes are often identified as the beginning of the \"Second Assyrian Empire\".\n\nWhen Tiglath-Pileser III had ascended the throne of Assyria, he invaded Babylonia, defeated its king [[Nabonassar]], and abducted the gods of \u0160apazza; these events are recorded in the [[Babylonian Chronicles|Assyrian-Babylonian Chronicle]].<ref>ABC 1 Col.1:5</ref>\n\nAfter subjecting Babylon to tribute, defeating Urartu and conquering the Medes, Persians and [[Neo-Hittite]]s, Tiglath-Pileser III directed his armies into [[Aramea]], of which large swathes had regained independence, and the commercially successful [[Mediterranean]] seaports of Phoenicia. He took [[Arpad (Syria)|Arpad]] near [[Aleppo]] in 740 BC after a siege of three years, and razed [[Hamath]]. [[Uzziah of Judah|Azariah]], king of [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]] had been an ally of the king of Hamath, and thus was compelled by Tiglath-Pileser to do him homage and pay yearly tribute.\n\n====Invasion of Israel (738 BC)====\n[[File:Capture of Astartu-1.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|The capture of the city of [[Ashteroth Karnaim|Astartu]] (in the land of king [[Og]] of [[Bashan]], east of the [[Jordan river]]), by the Assyrian king [[Tiglath-Pileser III]] about 730\u2013727 BCE, as depicted on a palace relief now kept on display at the British Museum.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Jones |first1=Clifford M. |title=Old Testament Illustrations |date=1971 |publisher=CUP Archive |page=77 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V8w7AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA77 |language=en}}</ref>]]\nIn 738 BC, during the reign of king [[Menahem]] of Israel, Tiglath-Pileser III occupied [[Philistia]] (modern-day southwestern [[Israel]] and the [[Gaza Strip]]) and invaded [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Israel]], imposing on it a heavy tribute.<ref>2 Kings 15:19</ref> [[Ahaz]], king of [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]], engaged in a war against Israel and Aramea, appealed for help to the Assyrian king by means of presents of gold and silver;<ref>2 Kings 16:8</ref> Tiglath-Pileser III accordingly \"marched against Damascus, defeated and put king [[Rezin]] to death, and besieged the city itself\".

He also forced tribute from the [[Arabs]] of the deserts in the [[Arabian peninsula]].\n\nIn 729 BC, Tiglath-Pileser III went to Babylonia and captured [[Nabu-mukin-zeri]], the king of Babylon.<ref>ABC 1 Col.1:21</ref> He had himself crowned as King Pulu of Babylon. Tiglath-Pileser III died in 727 BC, and was succeeded by [[Shalmaneser V]]. However, King [[Hoshea]] of Israel suspended paying tribute, and allied himself with [[Egypt]] against Assyria in 725 BC.

Urartu suffered a crushing defeat\u2014its capital city was sacked and its king Rusas committed suicide in shame. The [[Neo-Hittite]] states of northern [[Greater Syria|Syria]] were conquered, as well as  [[Cilicia]] and [[Commagene]].\n\nAssyria was belligerent towards [[Babylonia]] for ten years while Marduk-apla-iddina ruled Babylon.<ref>ABC 1 Col.1:41\u201342</ref> In 710 BC, Sargon attacked Babylonia and defeated Marduk-apla-iddina, who fled to his protectors in Elam.<ref>ABC 1 Col.2:1\u20133</ref> As a result of this victory the [[Greeks|Greek]] rulers of [[Cyprus]] gave allegiance to Assyria and king [[Midas]] of [[Phrygia]], fearful of Assyrian power, offered his hand in friendship. Sargon also built a new capital at [[Dur Sharrukin]] (\"Sargon's City\") near Nineveh, with all the tribute Assyria had collected from various nations.\n\n====Sennacherib, 705\u2013681 BC====\n[[File:Assyrian Crown-Prince MET DP-13006-005.jpg|thumb|Assyrian Crown-Prince, ca. 704\u2013681 BC.

He also reasserted Assyria's mastery of [[Corduene]] in Asia Minor.\n\nSennacherib decided to move the capital from Sargon's Dur-Sharrukin to the city of [[Nineveh]], and in Nineveh he built the famous \"the Palace without a Rival\", he made Nineveh a beautiful city and improved the city, planting orchards and gardens.<ref name=\"Neo-Assyrian Empire\"/>\n\n[[File:Neo-Assyrian Empire.png|right|thumb|200px|Neo-Assyrian Empire, showing Judah in grey]]\n\nThe [[Egyptians]] had begun agitating peoples within the Assyrian empire in an attempt to gain a foothold in the region. As a result, in 701 BC, [[Hezekiah]] of [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]], Lule king of [[Sidon]], Sidka, king of [[Ashkelon|Ascalon]] and the king of [[Ekron]] formed an alliance with Egypt against Assyria. Sennacherib attacked the rebels, conquering Ascalon, Sidon and Ekron and defeating the Egyptians and driving them from the region. He marched toward [[Jerusalem]], destroying 46 towns and villages (including the heavily defended city of [[Lachish]]) in his path. This is graphically described in [[Isaiah]] 10; exactly what happened next is unclear (the Bible says an angel of the Lord killed 185,000 Assyrian soldiers at Jerusalem after Hezekiah prayed in the temple).<ref>II Kings 18\u201319</ref> Sennacherib's account says Judah paid him tribute and he left.\n\nThe Hebrew Bible states that Hezekiah did pay tribute once, and the Assyrians left, but returned a second time when the soldiers were then killed; however what is certain is that Sennacherib failed to actually capture Jerusalem. Marduk-apla-iddina had returned to Babylonia during the reign of Sennacherib. The Assyrian king attacked him in 703 BC outside [[Kish (Sumer)|Kish]] and defeated him. Sennacherib plundered Babylonia and pursued Marduk-apla-iddina through the land. At his return to Assyria, Sennacherib installed a puppet ruler, [[Bel-ibni]], as king of Babylon.<ref>ABC 1 Col.2:12\u201323</ref> Bel-ibni, however, committed hostilities, so Sennacherib returned to Babylon in 700 BC and captured him and his officers.

Bikni), he then turned his attention westward to [[Phoenicia]]\u2014now allying itself with the [[Nubian people|Nubian]]/[[Kushite]] rulers of [[Egypt]] against him\u2014and sacked [[Sidon]] in 677 BC. He also captured [[Manasseh of Judah|King Manasseh]] of [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]] and kept him prisoner for some time in Babylon (2 Chronicles 33:11). Having had enough of Egyptian meddling, Esarhaddon raided Egypt in 673 BC. Two years later he launched a full invasion and conquered Egypt, chasing the Pharaoh [[Taharqa]] back to [[Nubia]], thus bringing to an end Nubian-Kushite rule in Egypt, and destroying the [[Kushite Empire]] which had begun in 760 BC.\n\n''The [[Babylonian Chronicles]]'' retells how Egypt \"was sacked and its gods were abducted\".<ref>ABC 1 Col.4:25; also in ABC 14:28\u201329</ref> The pharaoh [[Tirhakah]] fled Egypt, and a [[stele]] commemorating the victory, was set up at Sinjerli in [[Asia Minor]], north of the Gulf of [[Antioch]]; it is now in the [[Pergamon Museum]], Berlin. The Bible graphically recounts Egypt's demise in Isaiah 20:4 \"So shall the king of Assyria lead away the Egyptians prisoners, and the [[People of Ethiopia|Ethiopians]] captives, young and old, naked and barefoot, even with their buttocks uncovered, to the shame of Egypt. 5 And they shall be afraid and ashamed of [[Ethiopia]] their expectation, and of Egypt their glory.\"\n\nAssyria defeated [[Urartu]], annexed much of its territory and reduced it to vassalage, and expanded southwards as far as [[Dilmun]] (Bahrain) and into [[Arabia]] at this time. This was perhaps Assyria's greatest territorial extent.<ref name=\"Neo-Assyrian Empire\"/>\n\nHowever, the Assyrian governors and local puppet rulers Esarhaddon had appointed over Egypt were obliged to flee the restive native populace who yearned for independence now that the Kushites and Nubians had been ejected.\n\nA new campaign was launched by Esarhaddon in 669 BC. However, he became ill on the way and died. His elder son [[Shamash-shum-ukin]] became king of Babylon and his son [[Ashurbanipal]] became king of Assyria, with Ashurbanipal holding the senior position and Babylon subject to Nineveh.<ref>ABC 1 Col.4:30\u201333 and ABC 14:31\u201332, 37</ref> [[Bel (god)|Bel]] and the gods of Babylonia returned from their exile in Assur to Babylon in the first year of Shamash-shum-ukin's reign, and the [[akitu]] festival could be celebrated for the first time in twenty years.<ref>ABC 1 14:34\u201339 and ABC 1 Col.4:34\u201336</ref>\n\n====Ashurbanipal, 668\u2013631 BC====\n[[File:Sculpted reliefs depicting Ashurbanipal, the last great Assyrian king, hunting lions, gypsum hall relief from the North Palace of Nineveh (Irak), c. 645-635 BC, British Museum (16722368932).jpg|thumb|Part of the ''[[Lion Hunt of Ashurbanipal]]'', c. 645\u2013635 BC]]\n[[Ashurbanipal]], or \"Ashur-bani-apli\" (''Ashurbanapli, Asnapper''), succeeded his father [[Esarhaddon]] to the throne. He continued to campaign in and to dominate Egypt, when not distracted by having to deal with pressures from the Medes to the east, and [[Cimmerians]] and [[Scythians]] to the north of Assyria. He installed a native Egyptian Pharaoh, [[Psammetichus I|Psammetichus]], as a vassal king in 664 BC. However, after [[Gyges of Lydia]]'s appeal for Assyrian help against the Cimmerians was rejected, [[Lydia]]n mercenaries were sent to Psammetichus. By 652 BC, this vassal king was able to declare outright independence from Assyria with impunity, particularly as Ashurbanipal's older brother, Shamash-shum-ukin of Babylon, became infused with Babylonian nationalism, and began a major civil war in that year. However, the new dynasty in Egypt wisely maintained friendly relations with Assyria.\n\nShamash-shum-ukin attempted to raise a huge rebellion encompassing many vassal peoples against Ashurbanipal; however, this largely failed. This rebellion lasted until 648 BC, when Babylon was sacked, and Shamash-shum-ukin set fire to the palace, killing himself. Ashurbanipal then set about punishing the [[Chaldea]]ns, [[Arabs]] and [[Nabateans]] who had supported the Babylonian revolt. He invaded the [[Arabian Peninsula]] and routed and subjugated the Arabs, including the powerful [[Qedar]] tribe, taking much booty back to [[Nineveh]] and killing the Arab kings, Abiate and Uate. The Nabateans who dwelt south of the [[Dead Sea]] and in northern Arabia, and the Chaldeans in the far south east of Mesopotamia were also defeated and subjugated. [[Elam]] was the next target; it was attacked in 646 and 640 BC, and its capital [[Susa]] sacked.{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\n[[File:PLATE2AX.jpg|thumb|upright|Costumes of an Assyrian High Priest (left) and a King (right).]]\n\nAfter the crushing of the Babylonian revolt Ashurbanipal appeared master of all he surveyed. To the east, [[Elam]] was devastated and prostrate before Assyria, the [[Manneans]] and the [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] [[Persia]]ns and [[Medes]] were vassals. To the south, [[Babylonia]] was occupied, the [[Chaldean people|Chaldeans]], [[Arabs]], [[Shutu|Sutu]] and [[Nabateans]] subjugated, the [[Nubia]]n empire destroyed, and [[Egypt]] paid tribute. To the north, the [[Scythians]] and [[Cimmerians]] had been vanquished and driven from Assyrian territory, [[Urartu]], [[Phrygia]], [[Corduene]] and the neo [[Hittites]] were in vassalage, and [[Lydia]] pleaded for Assyrian protection. To the west, [[Aramea]] ([[Syria]]), the [[Phoenicians]], [[Israel]], [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]], [[Samarra]] and [[Cyprus]] were subjugated, and the [[Hellenised]] inhabitants of [[Caria]], [[Cilicia]], [[Cappadocia]] and [[Commagene]] paid tribute to Assyria.{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\nAssyria now appeared stronger than ever. However, his long struggle with Babylonia and Elam and their allies, and the constant campaigning to control and expand its vast empire in all directions, left Assyria exhausted. It had been drained of wealth and manpower; the devastated provinces could yield nothing to supply the needs of the imperial exchequer, and it was difficult to find sufficient troops to garrison the huge empire.\n\n[[File:Territorial organization of the Assyrian Empire in times of Ashurbanipal.svg|thumb|430px|Assyrian Empire to the death of Ashurbanipal, in dark green the ''pahitu''/''pahutu'' (provinces), in yellow the ''matu'' (subjects kingdoms), in cream color the Babylon kingdom, the yellow points show other subjects kingdoms, the black points show the ''pahitu''/''pahutu'' (provinces) of Babylon kingdom, and the brown letters provinces that existed previously]]\nAssyria, therefore, was ill-prepared to face the renewed hordes of [[Scythians]] who now began to harass the frontiers to the north and north east. After the Assyrians destroyed Elam, the [[Medes]] had begun to grow powerful, becoming the dominant force among the [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] peoples who had begun to settle the regions to the east of Mesopotamia circa 1000 BC at the expense of the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persians]] and the pre-Iranian Elamites and Manneans, and they were by the end of Ashurbanipal's reign only nominally under Assyrian vassalage. [[Asia Minor]] too was full of hostile [[Scythians]] and [[Cimmerians]] who had overrun [[Urartu]], [[Lydia]] and [[Phrygia]], before being driven back by the Assyrians. However, while Ashurbanipal lived, he was able to contain these potential threats.\n\n===Fall of Assyria, 631\u2013609 BC===\n{{Main|Medo-Babylonian war against Assyrian Empire}}\n{{History of Iraq}}\n{{ancient history}}\nThe empire began to disintegrate rapidly after a series of bitter civil wars broke out involving a number of claimants to the throne. [[Ashur-etil-ilani]] succeeded Ashurbanipal, but his reign was short and he was succeeded in 627 BC by his brother [[Sinsharishkun]]. After dealing with the revolt of the general [[Sin-shumu-lishir]], Sinsharishkun faced a much larger threat. His Babylonian vassal state had taken advantage of the upheavals in Assyria and rebelled under the previously unknown [[Nabopolassar]], a member of the [[Chaldea]]n tribe, in 625 BC. What followed was a long war fought in the Babylonian heartland. Nabopolassar tried to capture [[Nippur]], the main Assyrian center of power in Babylonia, but was defeated by Sinsharishkun. However, Nabopolassar did take the actual city of Babylon after a popular uprising there, and was crowned king of the city in 625 BC.\n\nSinsharishkun then lost more ground, before he succeeded in recapturing [[Uruk]] in about 624 BC, only to quickly lose it again. When Sinsharishkun led a large army to Babylonia in 623 BC, in an attempt to finally crush the rebellion, yet another war broke out in the Assyrian homeland. A relief army was sent back from the Babylonian campaign but changed sides, thereby allowing the usurper to reach the capital, Nineveh, without interference, and claim the throne. Sinsharishkun was able to quell the homeland rebellion, but precious time was lost to solve the Babylonian problem, and Nabopolassar was able to consolidate his position.\n\nIn 620 BC, Nabopolassar finally captured Nippur, becoming master of Babylonia. While these events were unfolding, the [[Medes]] had also freed themselves from Assyrian domination and consolidated power in what was to become [[Persia]]. In 616 BC, [[Cyaxares]], the Median king, made an alliance with Nabopolassar, and with the help of the [[Scythians]] and [[Cimmerians]], attacked Assyria. Assyria now faced overwhelming odds, and after four years of bitter fighting, the coalition destroyed Nineveh in 612 BC, after a three-month siege, followed by house-to-house fighting. Sinsharishkun was killed in the process, and the [[Battle of Nineveh (612 BC)|Fall of Nineveh]] marked the beginning of the end of the Assyrian Empire.\n\nA general called [[Ashur-uballit II]] was declared king of Assyria, and with belated military support from the Egyptian pharaoh [[Necho II]], whose dynasty had been installed with the help of the Assyrians, held out at [[Harran]] until 609 BC.<ref name=\"Grant, R G pg 19\">Grant, R G. ''Battle a Visual Journey Through 5000 Years of Combat''. London: Dorling Kindersley, 2005 pg 19</ref> Egyptian aid continued to the Assyrians, who desperately attempted to curb the increasing power of the Babylonians and Medes.\n\nIn 609 BC, at the [[Battle of Megiddo (609 BC)|Battle of Megiddo]], an Egyptian force defeated a [[Judean]] force under king [[Josiah]] and managed to reach the last remnants of the Assyrian army. In a final [[Fall of Harran|battle at Harran in 609 BC]], the Babylonians and Medes defeated the [[Assyria]]n-[[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] alliance, after which Assyria ceased to exist as an independent state.<ref name=\"Grant, R G pg 19\" /> It is not known if Ashur-uballit II was killed at Harran or if he survived; anyway, he subsequently disappeared from the pages of history. In 605 BC, another Egyptian force fought the Babylonians ([[Battle of Carchemish]]), helped by the remnants of the army of the former Assyria, but this too met with defeat.\n\nIn the mid-6th century BC, Babylonia and Assyria [[Achaemenid Assyria|became provinces]] of the [[Persian Empire]]. In 520 BC, Assyria made a final attempt to regain independence, with a large-scale rebellion against the [[Achaemenid Empire]], which was suppressed by king [[Darius the Great]].\n\nThough the Assyrians during the reign of [[Ashurbanipal]] destroyed the [[Elam]]ite civilization, the Assyrians' culture did influence the succeeding empires of the [[Medes]] and the [[Persia]]ns, [[Indo-Iranians|Indo-Iranian]] peoples who had been dominated by Assyria.<ref name=\"Assyrian Influence\">{{cite web|author=Hirad Dinavari|title=More alike than different|url=http://www.iranian.com/Letters/2002/June/june19.html|publisher=The Iranian|quote=The cultural give and take influenced the many things some of which are the cuneiform writing and the building of ziggurats which the later Assyrians and the Achaemenid (Hakhamaneshi) Persians inherited. The Assyrians for the most part were responsible for the destruction of the Elamite civilization but the Assyrians influenced the cultures of Media and [[Urartu]] and the influence of Elam lived on among the Medes and Persians. The various Iranian speaking peoples who had been coming into what is now Caucasus Iran, Afghanistan and Central Asia since around 4 thousand BCE were heavily influenced by the aboriginal Elamites and the Semitic Babylonians and Assyrians. This difference can be most noticed when one compares other Iranian speaking peoples who lived in Eurasia like the Scything and Sarmatians whose culture was very different with that of Iranian tribes who settled in the Iranian Plateau and became more intertwined with Slavic peoples. So from that far back Iran (the geographic location) has been multi-ethnic.}}</ref>\n\n====Environmental factors====\nA.W. Schneider and S.F.

Ironically, [[Nabonidus]], the last king of Babylon, was [[Kings of Assyria|Assyrian]], originating from [[Harran]], as was his son [[Belshazzar]]. After this it was ruled by [[Achaemenid]] Persia (Assyria revolted against Persia in 520 BC{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}), the Greek [[Seleucid]] kings, then again by various Persian dynasties, [[Sassanids]], [[Parthian Empire|Parthians]], etc. For a brief period under [[Trajan]], it was ruled by [[Rome]].\n\nAssyria survived as an entity, a subject province. The name survived also in various forms ([[Athura]], [[Asuristan]], [[Assyria (Roman province)|Roman Province of Assyria]], [[Seleucid]] [[Syria]], etc.) and the land was recognised as such by the Persians, Greeks, Romans, Armenians, Georgians and Byzantines. After the [[Arab]] conquest of the late 7th century AD the province of Assyria was finally dissolved.\n\nAssyrian culture survived; Assyrio-Babylonian gods were worshipped well into Christian times, as late as the 4th century AD [http://www.nineveh.com/Assyrians%20after%20Assyria.html], and temples were still being dedicated to the god [[Ashur (god)|Ashur]] in his home city in the late 3rd century AD. A number of kingdoms that had Assyrian identity, such as Assur, Hatra, [[Osrhoene]] and [[Adiabene]], sprung up in Assyria between the 2nd century BC and 4th century AD.<ref>{{cite web|title=National and Ethnic Identity in the Neo-Assyrian Empire and Assyrian Identity in Post-Empire Times|url=https://www.scribd.com/document/149115268/National-Identity-in-Neo-Assyrian-Empire|publisher=Simo Parpola|pages=20|quote=When the Seleucid Empire disintegrated at the end of the second century BC, its western remnants were annexed to Rome, while several semi-independent kingdoms of decidedly Assyrian stamp and/or identity (Osrhoene, Adiabene, Hatra, Assur) popped up in the East under Parthian overlordship. These kingdoms perpetuated Assyrian cultural and religious traditions but were also receptive to Christianity, whose central ideas were in line with the central tenets of Assyrian religion and ideology, and which was felt as intrinsically Assyrian because of the Aramaic affinity of Jesus and the disciples.}}</ref> [[Christianity]] took hold between the 1st and 3rd centuries AD, and Parthian and Sassanid Assyria ([[Asuristan]]) became the center of the [[Assyrian Church of the East]], [[Syriac Christianity]] and [[Syriac literature]] (the term \"Syria\" being an [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] (Luwian) corruption of \"Assyria\" adopted by the Greeks),<ref>http://www.aina.org/articles/ttaasa.pdf</ref> where it still survives.\n\n==Role of Aramaic==\n[[Tiglath Pileser III]] made Aramaic the lingua franca of the empire, originally the language of the Arameans. Aramaic was easier to write than Akkadian, so older documents collected by Assyrian kings were translated from Akkadian into Aramaic, and newer ones were written in Aramaic and ignored the Akkadian.<ref>{{cite web |title=Assyria |url=https://www.ancient.eu/assyria/ |publisher=Joshua J. Mark}}</ref> Aramaic was the common language of the people and traders, but the official government language was the Neo-Assyrian dialect of [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]]. By the 6th century, Aramaic had marginalised the [[Akkadian language]] so much that Aramaic came to be the [[Imperial Aramaic|imperial language]] of [[Achaemenid Assyria]]. One of the key factors contributing to the use of Aramaic was the rise and fall of Assyria; during its rule, deportations, colonisations, and intermarriage increased contact between Arameans and Assyrians.\n\nIn effect the populations of both Assyria and Babylonia had become an ethnic mix of native Akkadians and Arameans. Even though Aramaic was the common tongue of the empire, Akkadian continued to be the preferred language of royalty and the elites.<ref name=\"Parpola\" /> Rulers, royalty and elites were all trained to speak both Aramaic and Akkadian until, by the 7th century BC, the ruling class was fully bilingual.<ref name=\"Parpola\" /> The rest of the empire was divided into two sects: those who spoke Aramaic and those who spoke Akkadian. Generally, the common people and traders were also bilingual but Aramaic continued to dominate the empire outside Assyria proper.<ref name=\"Parpola\" /> As the Empire fell, only the elite knew how to read and write the [[Akkadian cuneiform|Akkadian script]]. The savage sacking of Nineveh and Assur, as well as numerous other Assyrian cities, ensured that few of these elites survived to pass on the language, but some cities such as [[Arrapkha]] were spared the destruction.\n\nAkkadian survived the fall of Assyria; the last recorded writings in Akkadian cuneiform date from the 1st century AD, and writings in Akkadian (but in the Aramaic/Syriac script) date as late as the 3rd century AD.\n\n==Administration==\n{{further|State communications in the Neo-Assyrian Empire}}\nThe Assyrian empire expanded through establishing [[province]]s and [[vassal state]]s.<ref name=\"Parker, Bradley J 2001\">Parker, Bradley J.

University of Helsinki: The Neo-Assyrian Text Corpus Project. 2001.</ref> Many of these lands were under control by members of the king's court.

University of Helsinki: The Neo-Assyrian Text Corpus Project. 2000.</ref>\n\nThe provinces were a form of territorial control and were made up of the capital city, farming villages, road stations, outposts, and garrisons. The province itself was managed by the provincial [[governor]], who also had militaristic duties like gathering and reporting military intelligence, or leading Assyrian armies in battle. As governors, they only answered to the king, and certain officials of the king's high court. A [[State communications in the Neo-Assyrian Empire|state communication system]], consisting of mule riders travelling in royal road with change stations within certain intervals, allowed the imperial court to communicate efficiently with the governors.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|last=Radner|first=Karen|authorlink=Karen Radner|title=The King's Road \u2013 the imperial communication network|encyclopedia=Assyrian empire builders|publisher=[[University College London]]|year=2012|url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/sargon/essentials/governors/thekingsroad/|ref=harv}}</ref> Those directly beneath the governors were their deputy governors, and they oversaw a number of auxiliary officials like bureaucrats, scribes, and accountants. The lowest rank in the provincial government were the village managers who mostly supervised local farming efforts and projects.<ref name=\"Parker, Bradley J 2001\"/>\n\nThe vassal states were under [[Hegemony|hegemonic]] control and these were territories gained through a show of military dominance \u2013 by either forcing their way through or proving that they could. Those who submitted peacefully remained relatively autonomous and their ruling elites were permitted to stay in power. Those who resisted were overthrown and had their rulers replaced with [[Puppet state|puppet officials]] loyal to Assyria. The terms for vassalage were that the vassal state was to pay Assyria tribute in the form of goods, labor, and soldiers in exchange for military protection. The protection provided by Assyria seemed to suit the needs of Assyria more than the needs of the vassal states, as Assyria have used a perceived threat toward a vassal state as an excuse to invade nearby settlements, and the vassal states have also been left to fend for themselves.<ref name=\"Parker, Bradley J 2001\"/>\n\nAssyrians invented a new way of dealing with conquered people. After conquering a land, it's people would be resettled to other areas within the empire, with land and state assistance. This policy was used to create a uniform population, although it produced some hotbeds of dissent. By the 7th century BC, the royal entourage included scholars, craftsmen and singers from Babylonia, Anatolia, Egypt, and Iran.<ref>Adam Hart-Davis, History: the Definitive Visual Guide: from the Dawn of Civilization to the Present Day (New York: DK Pub., 2012), p.80)</ref>\n\n==Society==\n[[File:Servants Dur Sharrukin Louvre AO19878-9.jpg|thumb|Eunuchs carrying war tribute]]\nThe Neo-Assyrian Empire was a warlike society with an expansionist ideology and, as a result of their constant expansion, they acquired a diverse and multi-ethnic empire. One Assyrian identity did not happen until, ironically, Ashurnasirpal II began deporting people from the empire. The majority of the displaced peoples were settled in the urban heart of the empire bringing with them what would become the common language: Aramaic, the first unifying factor.<ref name=\"Parpola\" /> The spreading of Aramaic is known as the Aramaization period and soon the new language would become the common language as well as the imperial language.

Thus, there are 7th-century copies of both the [[Epic of Gilgamesh]] and the [[En\u00fbma Eli\u0161]] from [[Ashurbanipal]]'s library in [[Nineveh]], as well as Neo-Assyrian versions of the [[Atra-Hasis]].\n\n[[Neo-Assyrian cuneiform]] is the final stage of the long evolution of the [[cuneiform script]]. The number of [[glyphs]] was reduced, and the glyph shapes were standardized and simplified, so that modern [[List of cuneiform signs|cuneiform sign inventories]] are usually based on the Neo-Assyrian glyph shapes. Neo-Assyrian cuneiform remained in use alongside the [[Aramaic alphabet]] well into [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] times. The [[Aramaic language]] from the 8th century BC was adopted as the Lingua Franca of the Assyrian Empire and continued by the [[Achaemenid Empire]]. Assyrian scribes are often depicted in pairs: one writing in Akkadian on the cuneiform tablet, the other writing in Aramaic on the parchment or papyrus.\n\nThe main cities that existed in Assyria itself were [[Nineveh]], [[Assur|Ashur]], [[Kalhu]] ([[Calah]], [[Nimrud]]), [[Sippar]], [[Opis]], [[Arrapha]] ([[Kirkuk]]), [[Harran]], [[Erbil|Arbela]] (Erbil) and [[Ekallatum]]. Outside of Assyria proper, major cities at various times under Assyrian domination were [[Babylon]], [[Damascus]] ([[Dimashq]]), [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]], [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]], [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]], [[Sidon]], [[Ecbatana]], [[Hattusa]], [[Jerusalem]], [[Susa]], [[Persepolis]], [[Carchemish]], [[Sardis]], [[Ur]], [[Uruk]], [[Nippur]] and [[Antioch]].\n\nAt the end of the Bronze Age, Nineveh was much smaller than [[Babylon]], but still one of the world's major cities (population about 33,000). By the end of the Neo-Assyrian period, it had grown to a population of some 120,000, and was possibly the largest city of that time.\n\nAll free male citizens were obliged to serve in the army for a time, a system which was called the [[ilku]]-service.

Mark}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\nAssyria was originally an Akkadian kingdom which evolved in the 25th to 24th centuries BC. The earliest Assyrian kings such as [[Tudiya]] were relatively minor rulers, and after the founding of the [[Akkadian Empire]], which lasted from 2334 BC to 2154 BC, these kings became subject to [[Sargon of Akkad]], who united all the Akkadian- and [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]]-speaking peoples of [[Mesopotamia]] (including the Assyrians) under one rule.\n\nThe urbanised Akkadian-speaking nation of Assyria emerged in the mid 21st century BC, evolving from the dissolution of the [[Akkadian Empire]]. In the Old Assyrian period of the [[Early Bronze Age]], Assyria had been a kingdom of northern Mesopotamia (modern-day northern [[Iraq]]), competing for dominance initially with the [[Hattians]] and [[Hurrians]] of [[Asia Minor]], and the ancient [[Sumero-Akkadian]] \"city states\" such as [[Isin]], [[Ur]] and [[Larsa]], and later with [[Babylonia]] which was founded by [[Amorites]] in 1894 BC, and often under [[Kassites|Kassite]] rule. During the 20th century BC, it established colonies in [[Asia Minor]], and under the 20th century BC King [[Ilushuma]], Assyria conducted many successful raids against the states of the south.\n\nAssyria fell under the control of the Amorite chieftain [[Shamshi-Adad I]] (c. 1809 \u2013 1776 BC), who established a dynasty and was unusually energetic and politically canny, installing his sons as puppet rulers at Mari and Ekallatm.<ref name=colo>[http://www.cemml.colostate.edu/cultural/09476/iraq02-05enl.html \"Neo-Assyria\", Colorado State University]</ref>\nFollowing this it found itself under short periods of [[Babylonia]]n and [[Mitanni]]-[[Hurrian]] domination in the 17th and 15th centuries BC respectively, followed by another period of power from 1365 BC to 1074 BC, that included the reigns of kings such as [[Ashur-uballit I]], [[Tukulti-Ninurta I]] (r. 1244\u20131208 B.C.), and [[Tiglath-Pileser I]].\n\n===Middle Assyrian Empire===\n[[File:Image from page 33 of \"Ancient seals of the Near East\" (1940).jpg|thumb|Middle-Assyrian Empire seal. 1400-1100 BCE.]]\nAshur-uballit extended Assyrian control over the rich farming lands of Nineveh and Arbela to the north.<ref name=met>[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/assy/hd_assy.htm \"Assyria, 1365\u2013609 B.C.\" in Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History Department of Ancient Near Eastern Art, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, (originally published October 2004, last revised April 2010,)]</ref> Tiglath-Pileser controlled the lucrative caravan routes that crossed the fertile crescent from the Mediterranean to the Persian Gulf.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=vXljf8JqmkoC&pg=PA249&lpg=PA249&dq=Adad-nirari+II&source=bl&ots=QxlmhmzlLw&sig=-gHT4AK_1s-SvCi5myCg6J1_9ao&hl=en&sa=X&ei=YUgoVejgDIa0yQSR04HwBA&ved=0CFAQ6AEwDA#v=onepage&q=Adad-nirari%20II&f=false Boardman, John and Edwards I.

By the end of the 2nd millennium BC, the Aramaean expansion had resulted in the loss of much Assyrian territory in Upper Mesopotamia.<ref name=met/>\n\nAfter the death of [[Tiglath-Pileser I]] in 1076 BC, Assyria was in comparative decline for the next 150 years. The period from 1200 BC to 900 BC was a [[Late Bronze Age collapse|Dark Age]] for the entire [[Near East]], [[North Africa]], [[Caucasus]], [[Mediterranean]] and [[Balkan]] regions, with great upheavals and mass movements of people. Assyria was in a stronger position during this time than potential rivals such as [[Egypt]], [[Babylonia]], [[Elam]], [[Phrygia]], [[Urartu]], [[Persia]] and [[Median Empire|Media]].{{sfn|Roux, pp.282\u2013283}}\n\n==History==\n===<span id=\"Growth\">Adad-nirari II and Ashurnasirpal II (911\u2013859 BC)</span>===\n{{Battles involving Assyria}}\nBeginning with the campaigns of [[Adad-nirari II]], Assyria again became a great power, overthrowing the [[Twenty-fifth dynasty of Egypt]] and conquering [[Elam]], [[Urartu]], [[Median Empire|Media]], [[Persia]], [[Mannea]], [[Gutium]], [[Phoenicia]]/[[Canaan]], [[Arabia]], [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Israel]], [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]], [[Philistia]], [[Edom]], [[Moab]], [[Samarra]], [[Cilicia]], [[Cyprus]], [[Chaldea]], [[Nabatea]], [[Commagene]], [[Dilmun]], [[Shutu]] and [[Neo-Hittites]]; driving the [[Nubians]], [[Kushites]] and [[People of Ethiopia|Ethiopians]] from Egypt; defeating the [[Cimmerians]] and [[Scythians]]; and exacting tribute from [[Phrygia]] among others. Adad-nirari II and his successors campaigned on an annual basis for part of every year with an exceptionally well-organized army.<ref name=colo/> He subjugated the areas previously under only nominal Assyrian vassalage, conquering and deporting [[Aramaeans|Aramean]] and [[Hurrian]] populations in the north to far-off places. Adad-nirari II then twice attacked and defeated [[Shamash-mudammiq]] of [[Babylonia]], annexing a large area of land north of the [[Diyala River|Diyala]] river and the towns of [[H\u012bt|Hit]] and Zanqu in mid Mesopotamia. He made further gains over Babylonia under [[Nabu-shuma-ukin I]] later in his reign. He was succeeded by [[Tukulti-Ninurta II]] in 891 BC, who further consolidated Assyria's position and expanded northwards into [[Asia Minor]] and the [[Zagros Mountains]] during his short reign.\n\nThe next king, [[Ashurnasirpal II]] (883\u2013859 BC), embarked on a vast [[Assyrian Army|program]] of expansion. During his rule, Assyria recovered much of the territory that it had lost around 1100 BC at the end of the Middle Assyrian period.<ref name=met /> Ashurnasirpal II also campaigned in the [[Zagros Mountains]] in modern [[Iran]], repressing a revolt against Assyrian rule by the [[Lullubi]] and [[Gutians]]. The Assyrians began boasting in their ruthlessness around this time. Ashurnasirpal II also moved his capital to the city of [[Kalhu]] ([[Calah]]/[[Nimrud]]). The palaces, temples and other buildings raised by him bear witness to a considerable development of wealth and art. Ashurnasirpal II introduced  a policy of mass deportation of conquered people, which continued on a greatly increased scale under his son, [[Shalmaneser III]].<ref name=Parpola>{{cite journal |last1=Parpola |first1=Simo |title=National and Ethnic Identity in the Neo-Assyrian Empire and Assyrian Identity in Post-Empire Times |url=http://jaas.org/edocs/v18n2/Parpola-identity_Article%20-Final.pdf |journal=Journal of Assyrian Academic Studies |volume=18 |issue=2 |year=2004}}</ref>\n\n===Shalmaneser III to Adad-nirari III (859\u2013783 BC)===\nAshurnasirpal's son, [[Shalmaneser III]] (859\u2013824 BC), had a long reign of 35 years, in which the capital was converted into an armed camp. Each year the Assyrian armies marched out to campaign. [[Babylon]] was occupied, and Babylonia reduced to vassalage. He fought against [[Urartu]] and marched an army against an alliance of [[Aramaeans|Aramean]] states headed by [[Hadadezer]] of [[Damascus]] and including [[Ahab]], king of [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Israel]], at the [[Battle of Qarqar]] in 853 BC. Despite Shalmaneser's description of 'vanquishing the opposition', it seems that the battle ended in a deadlock, as the Assyrian forces were withdrawn soon afterwards.\n\n[[File:Black_Obelisk_Yehu_in_front_of_Shalmaneser_III.jpg|thumb|upright=2|[[Shalmaneser III]] receiving the tribute of \"Jehu of the people of the land of [[Omri]]\" ({{lang-akk|{{cuneiform|7|\ud808\udd40\ud808\udf11\ud808\udc00 \ud808\ude25 \ud808\udd37\ud808\udf1d\ud808\ude91\ud808\udd3f}}}}), referring to [[Jehu]], king of northern Israel, as depicted on the [[Black Obelisk]], circa 840 BCE.]]\nShalmaneser took the neo [[Neo-Hittite|Hittite]] state of [[Carchemish]] in 849 BC, and in 842 BC, marched an army against [[Hazael]], King of [[Damascus]], besieging the city and forcing tribute, but not taking it. In 841 BC, he also brought under tribute [[Jehu]] of [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Israel]], and the [[Phoenicia]]n states of [[Tyre (Lebanon)|Tyre]], and [[Sidon]].

C. Hanson's Collection of Mesopotamian Documents |publisher=K.C. Hansen|accessdate=23 November 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe last four years of Shalmaneser's life were disturbed by the rebellion of his eldest son Ashur-nadin-aplu that nearly proved fatal to Assyria. Twenty seven cities, including [[Assur]], [[Erbil|Arbela]], [[Arrapha]] ([[Kirkuk]]) and other places joined the pretender. The rebellion was not directed primarily against the king, but rather against the provisional governors such as Dayan-Ashur who had assumed disproportionate power. The revolt was quashed with difficulty by [[Shamshi-Adad V]], Shalmaneser's second son, who succeeded him upon his death in 824 BC.\n\nThe long and bitter civil war had allowed the [[Babylonians]] to the south, the [[Medes]], [[Manneans]], the [[Persia]]ns to the north and east, the [[Arameans]], and the Neo-[[Hittites]] in the west to largely shake off Assyrian rule, and [[Shamshi-Adad V]] spent the remainder of his reign reasserting control over those peoples. During this period, [[Urartu]] took the opportunity to reassert its influence on the region. As a result of all these events, Assyria did not expand further during the reign of Shamshi-Adad V. [[Adad-nirari III]] was a boy when succeeding his father in 811 BC, and for five years until 806 BC, his mother, Queen [[Sammuramat]] (also depicted as [[Semiramis]]) ruled as regent in his stead. Despite the numerous legends  regarding this queen, she is mentioned little in Assyrian records of the time.\n\nIn 806 BC, [[Adad-nirari III]] took the reins of power. He invaded the [[Levant]] and subjugated the [[Arameans]], [[Phoenicians]], [[Philistines]], [[Israelites]], Neo-[[Hittites]] and [[Edomites]]. He entered [[Damascus]] and forced tribute upon its king [[Ben-Hadad III]]. He next turned to [[Iran]], and subjugated the [[Persia]]ns, [[Medes]] and [[Manneans]], penetrating as far as the [[Caspian Sea]]. His next targets were the [[Chaldea]]n and [[Shutu|Sutu]] tribes of southeastern Mesopotamia whom he conquered and reduced to vassalage.\n\n===Period of stagnation, 783\u2013745 BC===\n[[File:Cherub on a Neo-Assyrian seal.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Cherub]] on a [[Neo-Assyrian]] seal, ca. 1000-612 BC]]\nAdad-nirari III died prematurely in 783 BC, and this led to a period of true stagnation. [[Shalmaneser IV]] (783\u2013773 BC) seems to have wielded little authority, and a victory over [[Argishti I]], king of [[Urartu]] at [[Til Barsip]], is accredited to a general ('Turtanu') named [[Shamshi-ilu]] who does not even bother to mention his king. Shamshi-ilu also scored victories over the [[Arameans]] and Neo-[[Hittites]], and again, takes personal credit at the expense of his king.\n\n[[Ashur-dan III]] ascended the throne in 772 BC. He proved to be a largely ineffectual ruler who was beset by internal rebellions in the cities of [[Ashur]], [[Arrapkha]], and [[Guzana]]. He failed to make further gains in Babylonia and [[Aram-Naharaim|Aram]] (Syria). His reign was also marred by [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] and an ominous [[Solar Eclipse]]. [[Ashur-nirari V]] became king in 754 BC, but his reign seems to have been one of permanent revolution, and he appears to have barely left his palace in Nineveh before he was deposed by [[Tiglath-Pileser III]] in 745 BC, bringing a resurgence to Assyria.\n\n===Tiglath-Pileser III, 744\u2013727 BC===\n{{main|Tiglath-Pileser III}}\n[[File:Deportation of Jews by Assyrians.svg|thumb|left|350px|Deportation of Israelites by the Assyrian Empire]]\nWhen [[Tiglath-Pileser III]] ascended the throne, Assyria was in the throes of a revolution. [[Civil war]] and [[Infectious disease|pestilence]] were devastating the country, and many of Assyria's most northerly colonies in Asia Minor had been wrested from it by Urartu. In 746 BC, the city of Kalhu joined the rebels, but on the 13th of ''Iyyar'' in the following year, an Assyrian general (Turtanu) named Pulu seized the crown under the name of [[Tiglath-Pileser III]], and made sweeping changes to the Assyrian government, considerably improving its efficiency and security.\n\nThe conquered provinces were organized under an elaborate bureaucracy, with the king at the head\u2014each district paying a fixed tribute and providing a military contingent. The Assyrian forces at this time became a professional standing army. Assyrian policy was henceforth directed toward reducing the whole civilized world into a single empire, throwing its trade and wealth into Assyrian hands. These changes are often identified as the beginning of the \"Second Assyrian Empire\".\n\nWhen Tiglath-Pileser III had ascended the throne of Assyria, he invaded Babylonia, defeated its king [[Nabonassar]], and abducted the gods of \u0160apazza; these events are recorded in the [[Babylonian Chronicles|Assyrian-Babylonian Chronicle]].<ref>ABC 1 Col.1:5</ref>\n\nAfter subjecting Babylon to tribute, defeating Urartu and conquering the Medes, Persians and [[Neo-Hittite]]s, Tiglath-Pileser III directed his armies into [[Aramea]], of which large swathes had regained independence, and the commercially successful [[Mediterranean]] seaports of Phoenicia. He took [[Arpad (Syria)|Arpad]] near [[Aleppo]] in 740 BC after a siege of three years, and razed [[Hamath]]. [[Uzziah of Judah|Azariah]], king of [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]] had been an ally of the king of Hamath, and thus was compelled by Tiglath-Pileser to do him homage and pay yearly tribute.\n\n====Invasion of Israel (738 BC)====\n[[File:Capture of Astartu-1.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|The capture of the city of [[Ashteroth Karnaim|Astartu]] (in the land of king [[Og]] of [[Bashan]], east of the [[Jordan river]]), by the Assyrian king [[Tiglath-Pileser III]] about 730\u2013727 BCE, as depicted on a palace relief now kept on display at the British Museum.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Jones |first1=Clifford M. |title=Old Testament Illustrations |date=1971 |publisher=CUP Archive |page=77 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V8w7AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA77 |language=en}}</ref>]]\nIn 738 BC, during the reign of king [[Menahem]] of Israel, Tiglath-Pileser III occupied [[Philistia]] (modern-day southwestern [[Israel]] and the [[Gaza Strip]]) and invaded [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Israel]], imposing on it a heavy tribute.<ref>2 Kings 15:19</ref> [[Ahaz]], king of [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]], engaged in a war against Israel and Aramea, appealed for help to the Assyrian king by means of presents of gold and silver;<ref>2 Kings 16:8</ref> Tiglath-Pileser III accordingly \"marched against Damascus, defeated and put king [[Rezin]] to death, and besieged the city itself\".

He also forced tribute from the [[Arabs]] of the deserts in the [[Arabian peninsula]].\n\nIn 729 BC, Tiglath-Pileser III went to Babylonia and captured [[Nabu-mukin-zeri]], the king of Babylon.<ref>ABC 1 Col.1:21</ref> He had himself crowned as King Pulu of Babylon. Tiglath-Pileser III died in 727 BC, and was succeeded by [[Shalmaneser V]]. However, King [[Hoshea]] of Israel suspended paying tribute, and allied himself with [[Egypt]] against Assyria in 725 BC.

Urartu suffered a crushing defeat\u2014its capital city was sacked and its king Rusas committed suicide in shame. The [[Neo-Hittite]] states of northern [[Greater Syria|Syria]] were conquered, as well as  [[Cilicia]] and [[Commagene]].\n\nAssyria was belligerent towards [[Babylonia]] for ten years while Marduk-apla-iddina ruled Babylon.<ref>ABC 1 Col.1:41\u201342</ref> In 710 BC, Sargon attacked Babylonia and defeated Marduk-apla-iddina, who fled to his protectors in Elam.<ref>ABC 1 Col.2:1\u20133</ref> As a result of this victory the [[Greeks|Greek]] rulers of [[Cyprus]] gave allegiance to Assyria and king [[Midas]] of [[Phrygia]], fearful of Assyrian power, offered his hand in friendship.

Sennacherib marched into Cilicia, defeating the rebels and their Greek allies. He also reasserted Assyria's mastery of [[Corduene]] in Asia Minor.\n\nSennacherib decided to move the capital from Sargon's Dur-Sharrukin to the city of [[Nineveh]], and in Nineveh he built the famous \"the Palace without a Rival\", he made Nineveh a beautiful city and improved the city, planting orchards and gardens.<ref name=\"Neo-Assyrian Empire\"/>\n\n[[File:Neo-Assyrian Empire.png|right|thumb|200px|Neo-Assyrian Empire, showing Judah in grey]]\n\nThe [[Egyptians]] had begun agitating peoples within the Assyrian empire in an attempt to gain a foothold in the region. As a result, in 701 BC, [[Hezekiah]] of [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]], Lule king of [[Sidon]], Sidka, king of [[Ashkelon|Ascalon]] and the king of [[Ekron]] formed an alliance with Egypt against Assyria. Sennacherib attacked the rebels, conquering Ascalon, Sidon and Ekron and defeating the Egyptians and driving them from the region. He marched toward [[Jerusalem]], destroying 46 towns and villages (including the heavily defended city of [[Lachish]]) in his path. This is graphically described in [[Isaiah]] 10; exactly what happened next is unclear (the Bible says an angel of the Lord killed 185,000 Assyrian soldiers at Jerusalem after Hezekiah prayed in the temple).<ref>II Kings 18\u201319</ref> Sennacherib's account says Judah paid him tribute and he left.\n\nThe Hebrew Bible states that Hezekiah did pay tribute once, and the Assyrians left, but returned a second time when the soldiers were then killed; however what is certain is that Sennacherib failed to actually capture Jerusalem. Marduk-apla-iddina had returned to Babylonia during the reign of Sennacherib. The Assyrian king attacked him in 703 BC outside [[Kish (Sumer)|Kish]] and defeated him. Sennacherib plundered Babylonia and pursued Marduk-apla-iddina through the land. At his return to Assyria, Sennacherib installed a puppet ruler, [[Bel-ibni]], as king of Babylon.<ref>ABC 1 Col.2:12\u201323</ref> Bel-ibni, however, committed hostilities, so Sennacherib returned to Babylon in 700 BC and captured him and his officers.

In retaliation, the king of Elam attacked Babylonia. Ashur-nadin-shumi was captured and brought back to Elam and a new king called [[Nergal-ushezib]] was installed as ruler of Babylon.<ref>ABC 1 Col.2:36\u201345</ref> The Assyrians returned the next year to Babylonia and plundered the gods of [[Uruk]].

During the first year of Esarhaddon's rule, a rebellion broke out in the south of Babylonia. Nabu-zer-kitti-li\u0161ir, an ethnic [[Elamite]] governor of the ''mat Tamti'', with the help of the [[Chaldea]]ns, laid siege to [[Ur]]. The Elamite and his Chaldean allies were defeated and he fled to his kinsmen in Elam (''Hal-Tamti''); however, \"the king of Elam took him prisoner and put him to the sword\" (ABC 1 Col.3:39\u201342); also in (ABC 14:1\u20134).\n\n[[File:Image from page 39 of \"Ancient seals of the Near East\" (1940).jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Late Assyrian seal. Worshipper between [[Nabu]] and [[Marduk]]. 8th century BCE.]]\nIn 679 BC the [[Cimmerians]] and [[Scythians]] (a horse-riding horde from what is now southern [[Russia]]) crossed the [[Taurus Mountains]] and harassed Assyrian colonies in [[Cilicia]]. Esarhaddon swiftly attacked and drove these marauders away.\n\nAs king of Assyria, Esarhaddon immediately had Babylon rebuilt. Defeating the [[Scythians]], [[Cimmerians]] and [[Medes]] (again penetrating to Mt. Bikni), he then turned his attention westward to [[Phoenicia]]\u2014now allying itself with the [[Nubian people|Nubian]]/[[Kushite]] rulers of [[Egypt]] against him\u2014and sacked [[Sidon]] in 677 BC. He also captured [[Manasseh of Judah|King Manasseh]] of [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]] and kept him prisoner for some time in Babylon (2 Chronicles 33:11). Having had enough of Egyptian meddling, Esarhaddon raided Egypt in 673 BC. Two years later he launched a full invasion and conquered Egypt, chasing the Pharaoh [[Taharqa]] back to [[Nubia]], thus bringing to an end Nubian-Kushite rule in Egypt, and destroying the [[Kushite Empire]] which had begun in 760 BC.\n\n''The [[Babylonian Chronicles]]'' retells how Egypt \"was sacked and its gods were abducted\".<ref>ABC 1 Col.4:25; also in ABC 14:28\u201329</ref> The pharaoh [[Tirhakah]] fled Egypt, and a [[stele]] commemorating the victory, was set up at Sinjerli in [[Asia Minor]], north of the Gulf of [[Antioch]]; it is now in the [[Pergamon Museum]], Berlin. The Bible graphically recounts Egypt's demise in Isaiah 20:4 \"So shall the king of Assyria lead away the Egyptians prisoners, and the [[People of Ethiopia|Ethiopians]] captives, young and old, naked and barefoot, even with their buttocks uncovered, to the shame of Egypt. 5 And they shall be afraid and ashamed of [[Ethiopia]] their expectation, and of Egypt their glory.\"\n\nAssyria defeated [[Urartu]], annexed much of its territory and reduced it to vassalage, and expanded southwards as far as [[Dilmun]] (Bahrain) and into [[Arabia]] at this time. This was perhaps Assyria's greatest territorial extent.<ref name=\"Neo-Assyrian Empire\"/>\n\nHowever, the Assyrian governors and local puppet rulers Esarhaddon had appointed over Egypt were obliged to flee the restive native populace who yearned for independence now that the Kushites and Nubians had been ejected.\n\nA new campaign was launched by Esarhaddon in 669 BC. However, he became ill on the way and died. His elder son [[Shamash-shum-ukin]] became king of Babylon and his son [[Ashurbanipal]] became king of Assyria, with Ashurbanipal holding the senior position and Babylon subject to Nineveh.<ref>ABC 1 Col.4:30\u201333 and ABC 14:31\u201332, 37</ref> [[Bel (god)|Bel]] and the gods of Babylonia returned from their exile in Assur to Babylon in the first year of Shamash-shum-ukin's reign, and the [[akitu]] festival could be celebrated for the first time in twenty years.<ref>ABC 1 14:34\u201339 and ABC 1 Col.4:34\u201336</ref>\n\n====Ashurbanipal, 668\u2013631 BC====\n[[File:Sculpted reliefs depicting Ashurbanipal, the last great Assyrian king, hunting lions, gypsum hall relief from the North Palace of Nineveh (Irak), c. 645-635 BC, British Museum (16722368932).jpg|thumb|Part of the ''[[Lion Hunt of Ashurbanipal]]'', c. 645\u2013635 BC]]\n[[Ashurbanipal]], or \"Ashur-bani-apli\" (''Ashurbanapli, Asnapper''), succeeded his father [[Esarhaddon]] to the throne. He continued to campaign in and to dominate Egypt, when not distracted by having to deal with pressures from the Medes to the east, and [[Cimmerians]] and [[Scythians]] to the north of Assyria. He installed a native Egyptian Pharaoh, [[Psammetichus I|Psammetichus]], as a vassal king in 664 BC. However, after [[Gyges of Lydia]]'s appeal for Assyrian help against the Cimmerians was rejected, [[Lydia]]n mercenaries were sent to Psammetichus. By 652 BC, this vassal king was able to declare outright independence from Assyria with impunity, particularly as Ashurbanipal's older brother, Shamash-shum-ukin of Babylon, became infused with Babylonian nationalism, and began a major civil war in that year. However, the new dynasty in Egypt wisely maintained friendly relations with Assyria.\n\nShamash-shum-ukin attempted to raise a huge rebellion encompassing many vassal peoples against Ashurbanipal; however, this largely failed. This rebellion lasted until 648 BC, when Babylon was sacked, and Shamash-shum-ukin set fire to the palace, killing himself. Ashurbanipal then set about punishing the [[Chaldea]]ns, [[Arabs]] and [[Nabateans]] who had supported the Babylonian revolt. He invaded the [[Arabian Peninsula]] and routed and subjugated the Arabs, including the powerful [[Qedar]] tribe, taking much booty back to [[Nineveh]] and killing the Arab kings, Abiate and Uate. The Nabateans who dwelt south of the [[Dead Sea]] and in northern Arabia, and the Chaldeans in the far south east of Mesopotamia were also defeated and subjugated. [[Elam]] was the next target; it was attacked in 646 and 640 BC, and its capital [[Susa]] sacked.{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\n[[File:PLATE2AX.jpg|thumb|upright|Costumes of an Assyrian High Priest (left) and a King (right).]]\n\nAfter the crushing of the Babylonian revolt Ashurbanipal appeared master of all he surveyed. To the east, [[Elam]] was devastated and prostrate before Assyria, the [[Manneans]] and the [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] [[Persia]]ns and [[Medes]] were vassals. To the south, [[Babylonia]] was occupied, the [[Chaldean people|Chaldeans]], [[Arabs]], [[Shutu|Sutu]] and [[Nabateans]] subjugated, the [[Nubia]]n empire destroyed, and [[Egypt]] paid tribute. To the north, the [[Scythians]] and [[Cimmerians]] had been vanquished and driven from Assyrian territory, [[Urartu]], [[Phrygia]], [[Corduene]] and the neo [[Hittites]] were in vassalage, and [[Lydia]] pleaded for Assyrian protection. To the west, [[Aramea]] ([[Syria]]), the [[Phoenicians]], [[Israel]], [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]], [[Samarra]] and [[Cyprus]] were subjugated, and the [[Hellenised]] inhabitants of [[Caria]], [[Cilicia]], [[Cappadocia]] and [[Commagene]] paid tribute to Assyria.{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\nAssyria now appeared stronger than ever. However, his long struggle with Babylonia and Elam and their allies, and the constant campaigning to control and expand its vast empire in all directions, left Assyria exhausted. It had been drained of wealth and manpower; the devastated provinces could yield nothing to supply the needs of the imperial exchequer, and it was difficult to find sufficient troops to garrison the huge empire.\n\n[[File:Territorial organization of the Assyrian Empire in times of Ashurbanipal.svg|thumb|430px|Assyrian Empire to the death of Ashurbanipal, in dark green the ''pahitu''/''pahutu'' (provinces), in yellow the ''matu'' (subjects kingdoms), in cream color the Babylon kingdom, the yellow points show other subjects kingdoms, the black points show the ''pahitu''/''pahutu'' (provinces) of Babylon kingdom, and the brown letters provinces that existed previously]]\nAssyria, therefore, was ill-prepared to face the renewed hordes of [[Scythians]] who now began to harass the frontiers to the north and north east. After the Assyrians destroyed Elam, the [[Medes]] had begun to grow powerful, becoming the dominant force among the [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] peoples who had begun to settle the regions to the east of Mesopotamia circa 1000 BC at the expense of the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persians]] and the pre-Iranian Elamites and Manneans, and they were by the end of Ashurbanipal's reign only nominally under Assyrian vassalage. [[Asia Minor]] too was full of hostile [[Scythians]] and [[Cimmerians]] who had overrun [[Urartu]], [[Lydia]] and [[Phrygia]], before being driven back by the Assyrians. However, while Ashurbanipal lived, he was able to contain these potential threats.\n\n===Fall of Assyria, 631\u2013609 BC===\n{{Main|Medo-Babylonian war against Assyrian Empire}}\n{{History of Iraq}}\n{{ancient history}}\nThe empire began to disintegrate rapidly after a series of bitter civil wars broke out involving a number of claimants to the throne. [[Ashur-etil-ilani]] succeeded Ashurbanipal, but his reign was short and he was succeeded in 627 BC by his brother [[Sinsharishkun]]. After dealing with the revolt of the general [[Sin-shumu-lishir]], Sinsharishkun faced a much larger threat. His Babylonian vassal state had taken advantage of the upheavals in Assyria and rebelled under the previously unknown [[Nabopolassar]], a member of the [[Chaldea]]n tribe, in 625 BC. What followed was a long war fought in the Babylonian heartland. Nabopolassar tried to capture [[Nippur]], the main Assyrian center of power in Babylonia, but was defeated by Sinsharishkun. However, Nabopolassar did take the actual city of Babylon after a popular uprising there, and was crowned king of the city in 625 BC.\n\nSinsharishkun then lost more ground, before he succeeded in recapturing [[Uruk]] in about 624 BC, only to quickly lose it again. When Sinsharishkun led a large army to Babylonia in 623 BC, in an attempt to finally crush the rebellion, yet another war broke out in the Assyrian homeland. A relief army was sent back from the Babylonian campaign but changed sides, thereby allowing the usurper to reach the capital, Nineveh, without interference, and claim the throne. Sinsharishkun was able to quell the homeland rebellion, but precious time was lost to solve the Babylonian problem, and Nabopolassar was able to consolidate his position.\n\nIn 620 BC, Nabopolassar finally captured Nippur, becoming master of Babylonia. While these events were unfolding, the [[Medes]] had also freed themselves from Assyrian domination and consolidated power in what was to become [[Persia]]. In 616 BC, [[Cyaxares]], the Median king, made an alliance with Nabopolassar, and with the help of the [[Scythians]] and [[Cimmerians]], attacked Assyria. Assyria now faced overwhelming odds, and after four years of bitter fighting, the coalition destroyed Nineveh in 612 BC, after a three-month siege, followed by house-to-house fighting. Sinsharishkun was killed in the process, and the [[Battle of Nineveh (612 BC)|Fall of Nineveh]] marked the beginning of the end of the Assyrian Empire.\n\nA general called [[Ashur-uballit II]] was declared king of Assyria, and with belated military support from the Egyptian pharaoh [[Necho II]], whose dynasty had been installed with the help of the Assyrians, held out at [[Harran]] until 609 BC.<ref name=\"Grant, R G pg 19\">Grant, R G. ''Battle a Visual Journey Through 5000 Years of Combat''. London: Dorling Kindersley, 2005 pg 19</ref> Egyptian aid continued to the Assyrians, who desperately attempted to curb the increasing power of the Babylonians and Medes.\n\nIn 609 BC, at the [[Battle of Megiddo (609 BC)|Battle of Megiddo]], an Egyptian force defeated a [[Judean]] force under king [[Josiah]] and managed to reach the last remnants of the Assyrian army. In a final [[Fall of Harran|battle at Harran in 609 BC]], the Babylonians and Medes defeated the [[Assyria]]n-[[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] alliance, after which Assyria ceased to exist as an independent state.<ref name=\"Grant, R G pg 19\" /> It is not known if Ashur-uballit II was killed at Harran or if he survived; anyway, he subsequently disappeared from the pages of history. In 605 BC, another Egyptian force fought the Babylonians ([[Battle of Carchemish]]), helped by the remnants of the army of the former Assyria, but this too met with defeat.\n\nIn the mid-6th century BC, Babylonia and Assyria [[Achaemenid Assyria|became provinces]] of the [[Persian Empire]]. In 520 BC, Assyria made a final attempt to regain independence, with a large-scale rebellion against the [[Achaemenid Empire]], which was suppressed by king [[Darius the Great]].\n\nThough the Assyrians during the reign of [[Ashurbanipal]] destroyed the [[Elam]]ite civilization, the Assyrians' culture did influence the succeeding empires of the [[Medes]] and the [[Persia]]ns, [[Indo-Iranians|Indo-Iranian]] peoples who had been dominated by Assyria.<ref name=\"Assyrian Influence\">{{cite web|author=Hirad Dinavari|title=More alike than different|url=http://www.iranian.com/Letters/2002/June/june19.html|publisher=The Iranian|quote=The cultural give and take influenced the many things some of which are the cuneiform writing and the building of ziggurats which the later Assyrians and the Achaemenid (Hakhamaneshi) Persians inherited.

The various Iranian speaking peoples who had been coming into what is now Caucasus Iran, Afghanistan and Central Asia since around 4 thousand BCE were heavily influenced by the aboriginal Elamites and the Semitic Babylonians and Assyrians. This difference can be most noticed when one compares other Iranian speaking peoples who lived in Eurasia like the Scything and Sarmatians whose culture was very different with that of Iranian tribes who settled in the Iranian Plateau and became more intertwined with Slavic peoples.

Ironically, [[Nabonidus]], the last king of Babylon, was [[Kings of Assyria|Assyrian]], originating from [[Harran]], as was his son [[Belshazzar]]. After this it was ruled by [[Achaemenid]] Persia (Assyria revolted against Persia in 520 BC{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}), the Greek [[Seleucid]] kings, then again by various Persian dynasties, [[Sassanids]], [[Parthian Empire|Parthians]], etc. For a brief period under [[Trajan]], it was ruled by [[Rome]].\n\nAssyria survived as an entity, a subject province. The name survived also in various forms ([[Athura]], [[Asuristan]], [[Assyria (Roman province)|Roman Province of Assyria]], [[Seleucid]] [[Syria]], etc.) and the land was recognised as such by the Persians, Greeks, Romans, Armenians, Georgians and Byzantines. After the [[Arab]] conquest of the late 7th century AD the province of Assyria was finally dissolved.\n\nAssyrian culture survived; Assyrio-Babylonian gods were worshipped well into Christian times, as late as the 4th century AD [http://www.nineveh.com/Assyrians%20after%20Assyria.html], and temples were still being dedicated to the god [[Ashur (god)|Ashur]] in his home city in the late 3rd century AD. A number of kingdoms that had Assyrian identity, such as Assur, Hatra, [[Osrhoene]] and [[Adiabene]], sprung up in Assyria between the 2nd century BC and 4th century AD.<ref>{{cite web|title=National and Ethnic Identity in the Neo-Assyrian Empire and Assyrian Identity in Post-Empire Times|url=https://www.scribd.com/document/149115268/National-Identity-in-Neo-Assyrian-Empire|publisher=Simo Parpola|pages=20|quote=When the Seleucid Empire disintegrated at the end of the second century BC, its western remnants were annexed to Rome, while several semi-independent kingdoms of decidedly Assyrian stamp and/or identity (Osrhoene, Adiabene, Hatra, Assur) popped up in the East under Parthian overlordship. These kingdoms perpetuated Assyrian cultural and religious traditions but were also receptive to Christianity, whose central ideas were in line with the central tenets of Assyrian religion and ideology, and which was felt as intrinsically Assyrian because of the Aramaic affinity of Jesus and the disciples.}}</ref> [[Christianity]] took hold between the 1st and 3rd centuries AD, and Parthian and Sassanid Assyria ([[Asuristan]]) became the center of the [[Assyrian Church of the East]], [[Syriac Christianity]] and [[Syriac literature]] (the term \"Syria\" being an [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] (Luwian) corruption of \"Assyria\" adopted by the Greeks),<ref>http://www.aina.org/articles/ttaasa.pdf</ref> where it still survives.\n\n==Role of Aramaic==\n[[File:Aramaic alphabet.jpg|left|thumb|Example of the Aramaic alphabet.]]\n[[Tiglath Pileser III]] made Aramaic the lingua franca of the empire, originally the language of the Arameans. Aramaic was easier to write than Akkadian, so older documents collected by Assyrian kings were translated from Akkadian into Aramaic, and newer ones were written in Aramaic and ignored the Akkadian.<ref>{{cite web |title=Assyria |url=https://www.ancient.eu/assyria/ |publisher=Joshua J. Mark}}</ref> Aramaic was the common language of the people and traders, but the official government language was the Neo-Assyrian dialect of [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]]. By the 6th century, Aramaic had marginalised the [[Akkadian language]] so much that Aramaic came to be the [[Imperial Aramaic|imperial language]] of [[Achaemenid Assyria]]. One of the key factors contributing to the use of Aramaic was the rise and fall of Assyria; during its rule, deportations, colonisations, and intermarriage increased contact between Arameans and Assyrians.\n\nIn effect the populations of both Assyria and Babylonia had become an ethnic mix of native Akkadians and Arameans. Even though Aramaic was the common tongue of the empire, Akkadian continued to be the preferred language of royalty and the elites.<ref name=\"Parpola\" /> Rulers, royalty and elites were all trained to speak both Aramaic and Akkadian until, by the 7th century BC, the ruling class was fully bilingual.<ref name=\"Parpola\" /> The rest of the empire was divided into two sects: those who spoke Aramaic and those who spoke Akkadian. Generally, the common people and traders were also bilingual but Aramaic continued to dominate the empire outside Assyria proper.<ref name=\"Parpola\" /> As the Empire fell, only the elite knew how to read and write the [[Akkadian cuneiform|Akkadian script]]. The savage sacking of Nineveh and Assur, as well as numerous other Assyrian cities, ensured that few of these elites survived to pass on the language, but some cities such as [[Arrapkha]] were spared the destruction.\n\nAkkadian survived the fall of Assyria; the last recorded writings in Akkadian cuneiform date from the 1st century AD, and writings in Akkadian (but in the Aramaic/Syriac script) date as late as the 3rd century AD.\n\n==Administration==\n{{further|State communications in the Neo-Assyrian Empire}}\nThe Assyrian empire expanded through establishing [[province]]s and [[vassal state]]s.<ref name=\"Parker, Bradley J 2001\">Parker, Bradley J. ''The Mechanics of Empire: The Northern Frontier of Assyria as a Case Study in Imperial Dynamics''. University of Helsinki: The Neo-Assyrian Text Corpus Project. 2001.</ref> Many of these lands were under control by members of the king's court. Most of these offices had names that were titular, but holders of these offices may have enacted their namesakes in ceremonial manners.<ref>Mattila, Raija. ''The King\u2019s Magnates: A Study of the Highest Officials of the Neo-Assyrian Empire''. University of Helsinki: The Neo-Assyrian Text Corpus Project. 2000.</ref>\n\nThe provinces were a form of territorial control and were made up of the capital city, farming villages, road stations, outposts, and garrisons. The province itself was managed by the provincial [[governor]], who also had militaristic duties like gathering and reporting military intelligence, or leading Assyrian armies in battle. As governors, they only answered to the king, and certain officials of the king's high court. A [[State communications in the Neo-Assyrian Empire|state communication system]], consisting of mule riders travelling in royal road with change stations within certain intervals, allowed the imperial court to communicate efficiently with the governors.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|last=Radner|first=Karen|authorlink=Karen Radner|title=The King's Road \u2013 the imperial communication network|encyclopedia=Assyrian empire builders|publisher=[[University College London]]|year=2012|url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/sargon/essentials/governors/thekingsroad/|ref=harv}}</ref> Those directly beneath the governors were their deputy governors, and they oversaw a number of auxiliary officials like bureaucrats, scribes, and accountants. The lowest rank in the provincial government were the village managers who mostly supervised local farming efforts and projects.<ref name=\"Parker, Bradley J 2001\"/>\n\nThe vassal states were under [[Hegemony|hegemonic]] control and these were territories gained through a show of military dominance \u2013 by either forcing their way through or proving that they could. Those who submitted peacefully remained relatively autonomous and their ruling elites were permitted to stay in power. Those who resisted were overthrown and had their rulers replaced with [[Puppet state|puppet officials]] loyal to Assyria. The terms for vassalage were that the vassal state was to pay Assyria tribute in the form of goods, labor, and soldiers in exchange for military protection. The protection provided by Assyria seemed to suit the needs of Assyria more than the needs of the vassal states, as Assyria have used a perceived threat toward a vassal state as an excuse to invade nearby settlements, and the vassal states have also been left to fend for themselves.<ref name=\"Parker, Bradley J 2001\"/>\n\nAssyrians invented a new way of dealing with conquered people. After conquering a land, it's people would be resettled to other areas within the empire, with land and state assistance. This policy was used to create a uniform population, although it produced some hotbeds of dissent. By the 7th century BC, the royal entourage included scholars, craftsmen and singers from Babylonia, Anatolia, Egypt, and Iran.<ref>Adam Hart-Davis, History: the Definitive Visual Guide: from the Dawn of Civilization to the Present Day (New York: DK Pub., 2012), p.80)</ref>\n\n==Society==\n[[File:Servants Dur Sharrukin Louvre AO19878-9.jpg|thumb|Eunuchs carrying war tribute]]\nThe Neo-Assyrian Empire was a warlike society with an expansionist ideology and, as a result of their constant expansion, they acquired a diverse and multi-ethnic empire. One Assyrian identity did not happen until, ironically, Ashurnasirpal II began deporting people from the empire. The majority of the displaced peoples were settled in the urban heart of the empire bringing with them what would become the common language: Aramaic, the first unifying factor.<ref name=\"Parpola\" /> The spreading of Aramaic is known as the Aramaization period and soon the new language would become the common language as well as the imperial language. As the people settled in the new land, they became exposed to Assyrian cultural ideas such as \"royal ideologies, religious ideas and mythologies...\" and it \"was incessantly propagated to all segments of the population through imperial art, emperor cult, religious festivals, and the cults of A\u0161\u0161ur, I\u0161tar, Nab\u00fb, S\u00een and other Assyrian gods.\"<ref name=\"Parpola\" /> This was a process known as \"Assyrianization.\"<ref name=\"Parpola\" /> The process of Assyrianization was a gradual process that occurred through generations of intermarriages, military participation, and daily interaction with Assyrian people (those who were not descended from the deportees generations earlier).<ref name=\"Parpola\" /> Through the generations of cultural and linguistic exchange there came to be a homogenous Assyrian identity.\n\n===Eunuchs in elite society===\nEunuchs often filled roles as servants to the kings and accompanied him in almost all aspects of ruling, such as administrative duties and rituals.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=N'Shea|first=Omar|last2=Omar|first2=N'Shea|title=Royal Eunuchs and Elite Masculinity in the Neo-Assyrian Empire|url=https://www.academia.edu/29536761|journal=Near Eastern Archaeology |language=en|volume=79}}</ref> Royal eunuchs were regularly promoted to being provincial governors and they could rule the lands as they saw fit; they could \"erect their own steles, place their names before that of the king's, and grant zakatu (tax-free status) to their subjects.\"<ref name=\":0\" /> As governors of their own lands, they had the right to declare war on other governances and collect any tribute that may have resulted from the battles.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Culture==\n{{further|Assyrian sculpture|Art and architecture of Assyria|Ancient Assyrian religion}}\n{{multiple image|perrow=2|total_width=400|caption_align=center\n| align    = right\n| direction =horizontal\n| header=Assyrian cuneiform syllabary<br><small>(circa 650 BC)</small>\n| image1   = Akkadian syllabary.svg\n| image2   = Mesopotamian palace paving slab REM.JPG\n| footer= Left: Simplified cuneiform syllabary, in use during the Assyrian period.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Krejci |first1=Jaroslav |title=Before the European Challenge: The Great Civilizations of Asia and the Middle East |date=1990 |publisher=SUNY Press |isbn=978-0-7914-0168-2 |page=34 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M88CVW8RkCcC&pg=PA34 |language=en}}</ref> The \"C\" before and after vowels stands for \"Consonant\".

Thus, there are 7th-century copies of both the [[Epic of Gilgamesh]] and the [[En\u00fbma Eli\u0161]] from [[Ashurbanipal]]'s library in [[Nineveh]], as well as Neo-Assyrian versions of the [[Atra-Hasis]].\n\n[[Neo-Assyrian cuneiform]] is the final stage of the long evolution of the [[cuneiform script]]. The number of [[glyphs]] was reduced, and the glyph shapes were standardized and simplified, so that modern [[List of cuneiform signs|cuneiform sign inventories]] are usually based on the Neo-Assyrian glyph shapes. Neo-Assyrian cuneiform remained in use alongside the [[Aramaic alphabet]] well into [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] times. The [[Aramaic language]] from the 8th century BC was adopted as the Lingua Franca of the Assyrian Empire and continued by the [[Achaemenid Empire]]. Assyrian scribes are often depicted in pairs: one writing in Akkadian on the cuneiform tablet, the other writing in Aramaic on the parchment or papyrus.\n\nThe main cities that existed in Assyria itself were [[Nineveh]], [[Assur|Ashur]], [[Kalhu]] ([[Calah]], [[Nimrud]]), [[Sippar]], [[Opis]], [[Arrapha]] ([[Kirkuk]]), [[Harran]], [[Erbil|Arbela]] (Erbil) and [[Ekallatum]]. Outside of Assyria proper, major cities at various times under Assyrian domination were [[Babylon]], [[Damascus]] ([[Dimashq]]), [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]], [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]], [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]], [[Sidon]], [[Ecbatana]], [[Hattusa]], [[Jerusalem]], [[Susa]], [[Persepolis]], [[Carchemish]], [[Sardis]], [[Ur]], [[Uruk]], [[Nippur]] and [[Antioch]].\n\nAt the end of the Bronze Age, Nineveh was much smaller than [[Babylon]], but still one of the world's major cities (population about 33,000). By the end of the Neo-Assyrian period, it had grown to a population of some 120,000, and was possibly the largest city of that time.\n\nAll free male citizens were obliged to serve in the army for a time, a system which was called the [[ilku]]-service. The Assyrian law code was compiled during this period.\n\n==See also==\n{{Iron Age}}\n* [[Timeline of the Assyrian Empire]]\n* [[Mesopotamian Religion]]\n* [[Military history of the Neo-Assyrian Empire]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20130524202612/http://ethesis.helsinki.fi/julkaisut/hum/aasia/pg/teppo/ Women and their Agency in the Neo-Assyrian Empire], Saana Teppo, Master's Thesis, April 2005.

Punctuality dents during winters slightly due to fog.\n\nSampoorna Kranti Express is currently the fastest train in the Superfast category of Indian Railways. The train makes only three stops between Patna and New Delhi: at [[Kanpur Central]], [[Mirzapur]] and [[Mughalsarai, Varanasi|Mughalsarai]](also known as [[Pt. Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Junction  ]]). The train is hauled by [[WAP4 Engine|WAP7 Engine]]. It has LHB coaches. It is now operated on HOG system (Hotel Load) in which the power to coaches is provided directly from locomotive instead of EOGs (Power Cars). It is the first superfast train in India to have a LHB Rake. During its run with ICF coaches it ran with the maximum length permitted in Indian Railway of 24 coaches. Now, with LHB Coaches the composition of the train carriages is as follows:\nclass = AC 1 Tier (01), AC 2 Tier (02), AC 3 Tier (03), Sleeper 3 Tier (09), Unreserved seating (03) Pantry Car (01) EOG (02) (Total=22 Coaches).

It started as a [[Vocaloid]] song series created by {{nihongo|Jin (Shizen no Teki-P)|\u3058\u3093(\u81ea\u7136\u306e\u6575P)||}}. The story revolves around the Mekakushi Dan, a group of young people with unusual eye-related powers.\n\nThe series became infamous on the video sharing website [[Niconico]] after the release of the music video and song for \"Kagerou Week\", which primarily featured character Hibiya Amamiya (supporting character Hiyori Asahina referred to only in the song's lyrics), also gave the series its name. The song has amassed over 10 million views and is the most popular song of the project. Eight light novels have been released, written by Jin and illustrated by {{nihongo|Sidu|\u3057\u3065|Shizu}}. A manga adaptation with illustrations by {{nihongo|Mahiro Satou|\u4f50\u85e4\u307e\u3072\u308d|Sat\u014d Mahiro|}}, began serialization in ''[[Monthly Comic Gene]]'' on June 15, 2012, also written by Jin. A 12-episode anime adaptation titled {{nihongo|'''''Mekakucity Actors'''''|\u30e1\u30ab\u30af\u30b7\u30c6\u30a3\u30a2\u30af\u30bf\u30fc\u30ba|Mekakushiti Akut\u0101zu|lit. \"Blindfold-city Actors\"}}\u2014\"Mekakucity\" being a [[portmanteau]] of \"mekakushi\" (\"blindfold\" in Japanese) and \"city\"\u2014aired between April 12 and June 28, 2014. The series was directed by Akiyuki Shinbo and Y\u016bki Yase, and animated at [[Shaft (company)|Shaft]], with the script also written by Jin.\n\n==Plot==\nShintar\u014d Kisaragi of \"Kashiwa City\", Japan is an 18-year-old [[hikikomori|hiki]]-[[NEET]] who has not left his room in two years, engrossing himself with his computer and the internet. However, on August 14, due to the messing about of the cyber girl Ene, who lives inside his computer, Shintar\u014d spills soda on his computer keyboard and is forced to go outside to buy a new one, due to the fact that during the Obon festival none of the stores will deliver until August 17. (In the manga's second alternate storyline, he goes to buy food for his female pet rabbit; Tono.) Shintar\u014d goes to the department store, where a group of criminals break in and hold the people inside hostage for ransom. Here he comes in contact with a group of people calling themselves the {{nihongo|\"Mekakushi Dan\"|\u30e1\u30ab\u30af\u30b7\u56e3||lit. \"Blindfold Gang\"}}, who stop the robbery with their mysterious eye powers and \"force\" Shintar\u014d to join into their group.\n\nBefore this occurs, Shintar\u014d's younger sister, Momo Kisaragi, is a popular idol and first-year high school student who has the ability to attract people's attention. This is due to the \"Drawing Eyes\" ability, which she cannot control and causes people to look at her wherever she goes. One day, while fleeing from a horde of fans, she meets the Mekakushi Dan leader, Tsubomi Kido, who invites Momo to join, which she does. \n\nWhile meeting the first four members of the Mekakushi Dan, Marry trips and gets Momo's phone wet, and the Mekakushi Dan all go to the department store to buy a new phone for Momo. Kido uses her ability to keep people from staring at Momo, but while in the store, they find out Shintar\u014d is there at the same time. The terrorists break in and take all the shoppers hostage, but with Kido's eye power, she, Momo, Marry, Seto, and Kano are invisible and thus do not get caught. They work together to stop the heist, though Shintar\u014d passes out, and they bring him to their hideout and introduce him and Ene as members once the former awakens. Afterwards, they all go to the amusement park to have fun. However, further events begin to unfold.\n\nThe prologue for the novels' storyline is told in the second novel, ''-a headphone actor-''. Takane Enomoto and Haruka Kokonose, students of Kenjir\u014d Tateyama, plan a class booth for their school's cultural festival. Haruka gets an idea to host a shooting booth; however, this idea could not be fulfilled due to Kenjir\u014d spending all their booth funds on a rare specimen. Takane, being a highly-skilled gamer, decides that instead of a shooting booth with a large amount of equipment, they should make a video game of a first-person shooter. Kenjir\u014d would be in charge of programming, Haruka was in charge of illustration and Takane was responsible for playing as the opponent. Their plan captured a great amount of attention, good and bad.\n\nThe series contains alternative storylines, endings (and in some cases, beginnings) depending on the format of the media, called \"routes\".<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">\"Kagerou Project Perfect Guide\" (2016)</ref>\n\n* Music Route, occurring between the years 2011-2013 initially and otherwise beyond, is the original first \"route\". It comes first in the official \"timelines\" order. It contains all of the official music videos for the \"Kagerou Project\" songs, with music by Jin, and animations by Wannyanp\u016b and Sidu (later only Sidu).<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Many notable songs, however, are left out of the initial, chronological \"music route\" described, though they are stated to still be included in the overall route. \"Lost Time Memory\" in Music Route splits into \"Route XX\", \"Route 1\", and \"Route 2\", with \"XX\" being a \"bad ending\", \"1\" leading to the main storyline, and \"2\" implied a \"good ending\".<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n* Manga Route, published between the years 2012 (June) and currently, comes second in the official \"timelines\" order. Though it debuted in June 2012, Jin confirmed he was working on the manga earlier on, writing the story for it as of \"Konoha's World Situation\"'s music video release in May 2012. The manga would later split into two alternate timelines, the second following drastically different events from the first.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n* Novels Route, published between the years 2012 (May) through 2017 (2018 for the US release), comes after Manga Route and seemingly before the Mekakucity Actors anime in the official \"timelines\" order.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n* Mekakucity Actors Route, the initially airing anime which aired beginning of April 2014 through June 2014, was not included in the official timelines of the \"Kagerou Project Perfect Guide\" (2016); however, the anime itself signifies more initially conclusive events. The lack of inclusion in the official timelines, despite its existence at the time, seems to indicate it comes after them as well.\n* Kagerou Daze -in a day's- (\u30ab\u30b2\u30ed\u30a6\u30c7\u30a4\u30ba-in a day's-) is an MX4D produced an animated short movie in which the Mekakushi Dan join together to once again stop an incident occurring at the mall. This Mekakushi Dan consists of Dan members 1-7 initially, and also containing Ene, Hibiya Amamiya, Konoha, and Hiyori Asahina. This is despite many notable events of the previous \"routes\". Certain other members related to the Dan do not appear in this \"route\", while instead \"new\" characters do; however, the \"new\" characters' identities were kept somewhat secret, including their names. An initial promotion for the film described it as a \"Route-2\", though the events contained seem wholly different to the \"Route-2\" that occurs in \"Lost Time Memory\"'s music video. The \"new\" characters were created specifically for this film.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nVarious other (including smaller or shorter) \"timelines\" are also contained within major \"routes\" or other side materials. These are all indicated in detail in the \"Kagerou Project Perfect Guide\" (2016).<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> While many \"timelines\" occur between the dates of August 14\u201315 (and in some cases a short time beyond, such as August 17, among other dates) some \"timelines\"'s initial storylines are indicated to happen before the \"main\" series begins. This often involves the backstories of the \"trio\" of Kido, Kano, and Seto and their encounters, on their own or otherwise, and notably involving supporting characters Ayano Tateyama, and Mekakushi Dan member Marry Kozakura (notably detailing her meeting with character Seto). Yet more timelines occur detailing Marry's own backstory, and events that happen long before that; also indicated by which timeline, or \"August 15th\" (among similar close dates) is referred to.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n==Characters==\n{{excessive detail|date=January 2019}}\n\n===Mekakushi Dan===\n;{{Nihongo|{{visible anchor|Kido}}|\u30ad\u30c9|Kido}} / {{Nihongo|{{visible anchor|Tsubomi Kido}}|\u6728\u6238 \u3064\u307c\u307f|Kido Tsubomi}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Y\u016bko Kaida]]}}\n:Kido is member No. 1 of the Mekakushi Dan and its current leader.

Because she was always treated cautiously by those around her, she harbored a strong desire to \"disappear\". One day, her father's business went bankrupt, driving him to set their house on fire. After being burned to death in the blaze, Kido came into contact with the Heat Haze along with her older half-sister Rin ({{voiced by|[[Yuki Kaida]]}}) and was possessed by the snake with the \"Concealing Eyes\" ability, thus acquiring the power to hide her presence, as well as the presence of anyone else within a two meter radius.

The manga also reveals the event of Kano first meeting Kido at the orphanage, told during the different alternative second timeline (also different from the novels version). Kido gives Kano her coat, as she noticed he was cold, Kano reacting with a surprised expression. The timeline would then go on to explain the two became fast childhood friends before meeting Seto later on, becoming a childhood friend of Seto's as well; the three being described officially, in relationship charts published in the official website as well as \"Kagerou Project Perfect Guide\" (2016),<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> as seeing each other as \"childhood friends\".<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n: Though Kido (in the novels) initially requests they do not use [[keigo]] (Japanese formalities), as it reminds her of her biological family, and because she dislikes such formalities now; Kano in the manga's alternate second timeline thought he ''was'' originally going to use [[keigo]] with her before she requested that. Initially dropping the formalities and beginning to call her by her first name alone, \"Tsubomi\", while with the Tateyamas and while during middle school two years before the main series begins (including while attending the school festival put on by Haruka and Takane), Kano would later come to address her by her last name (\"Kido\") after they leave the Tateyama household (an event which occurs in every \"route\" described in the \"Kagerou Project Perfect Guide\" (2016).),<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> the other two of the trio doing the same for him in every \"route\".\n\n:Though Kido was initially described (in Mekakucity Actors' script) with an \"official\" age of \"17\", and Kano and Seto \"16\", this would not be chronologically possible as the \"trio\" of Kido, Kano, and Seto are all in the same school grade, with varying birthdays (January 2, May 10, and March 3rd respectively). As a typical Japanese school year begins in April and ends in March (the series taking place in \"Kashiwa City\", Japan, later noted to also be in the Chiba prefecture) the ages conflicted with the official timelines, many taking place on August 14th-August 15th and later (in some cases) 17th.

This change possibly references the music videos, as the entire course of the typical plot changes in the manga route's second timeline, when Marry hears loud text message notifications on Seto's phone instead of music playing, becoming frightened by the sound. The text message notifications are coming from a worried younger Kano, Kido, and Ayano, as Seto was already with the Tateyamas in this \"route\".

Initially, including in earlier Talkers chapters, the Trio and the Tateyamas still appeared to function as a foster unit, such as when they talk about celebrating Kenjirou's birthday (Ayano, here seemingly alive, also appears at the household).

Marry claims she wants a \"brother\" (or, specifically, an \"''[[Japanese honorifics|onii-chan]]''\"-like figure), and targets the boys present in her \"search\" for an \"''onii-chan''\". Previously during the same chat, Shintar\u014d asks Kano if the Trio were \"kind of\" like siblings, to which Kano replies saying he doesn't believe he (Kano) has much \"''onii-chan'' power\" (\"big brother power\"), eventually implying Shintar\u014d has more of that than he does.

They created a team of \"heroes\" and Kano gave it its name, the Mekakushi Dan\u2014\"Mekakushi\" being a pun on Kido's eye ability. Unlike Seto, Kano uses his eye ability frequently, shifting outward emotions on a whim while never showing what he is truly feeling on the inside. He and Ayano were very close, as evidenced by the fact that (in the novels and anime \"routes\") she only shared her suspicions about Kenjir\u014d with him. As a result (in the novels \"route\") he often impersonated her and went to school in her stead, while she researched a way to stop the plans of Clearing Eyes. Ayano's death affects him greatly, and the added trauma of (in the novels \"route\") having to pretend to be Ayano's corpse during the funeral (as she did not leave behind a body) leaves him emotionally distressed. Though he uses his power to maintain a mask of lightheartedness and mischief, he develops a tendency to lash out at people close to him, sometimes by imitating people they care about, such as when he impersonated Haruka to upset Ene, or when impersonating Ayano to upset Shintar\u014d.\n\n:In the music video for {{Nihongo|\"Yobanashi Deceive\"|\u591c\u5484\u30c7\u30a3\u30bb\u30a4\u30d6||\"Night Tales Deceive\"}} in \"music\" route, Kano continuously walks the streets at night. He briefly is seen wearing hair clips while grinning, while images of a younger Seto and younger Kido are also seen behind him (Ayano is also noted to wear such hair clips; Seto being shown wearing them too in the video). Kano is later seen with a \"female\" form, shown more than once (including together) in both the official music video as well as published artbooks.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> He is always \"Deceiving\", initially believing himself to be something like a \"monster\". When a \"monster\" (implied to be Clearing Eyes in the novels) speaks to him one day, Kano begins to descend into always telling \"lies\", unable to tell his true self from his \"Deceiving\" self. He is frequently seen around and holding (including up to his face) masks, indicating his \"Deceiving\". At the end of the video, he bows to the viewer, as if it was a performance.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n:In the manga's alternate second timeline, his relationship with Ayano is more strained due to him being angry at her for suggesting to kill Marry.

She is 1/4 [[Medusa]] and has white hair that wiggles when she is happy or frightened and naturally occurring red eyes. Her appearance is that of a teenage girl, but due to her Medusa blood, her actual age is 140 years. Marry is extremely shy around strangers, and will often hide behind Seto, Kido, or Momo. Her songs are {{Nihongo|\"K\u016bs\u014d Forest\"|\u7a7a\u60f3\u30d5\u30a9\u30ec\u30b9\u30c8||\"Fantasy Forest\"}} and {{Nihongo|\"Marry no Kak\u016b Sekai\"|\u30de\u30ea\u30fc\u306e\u67b6\u7a7a\u4e16\u754c||\"Marry's Fictional World\"}}.\n\n:When Marry was younger, she lived in a small house in the woods with her mother, Shion, who was half Medusa. While growing up, she was constantly warned by her mother that should they make eye contact with others, the person would be turned to stone. One day, when she was playing outside against her mother's warnings, she was found and tortured by a group of boys. Shion successfully turned Marry's attackers to stone, but the two were both beaten to death and were brought into the Heat Haze by Azami, Shion's full Medusa mother (and Marry's grandmother). Upon entering it, Azami planted the snake with the \"Combining Eyes\" ability, the core of the Medusa, into Shion, who willingly gave it up to Marry so that she could have a second chance at life. As a result, along with the \"Eye Contact\" ability she had since birth, which allowed Marry to temporarily paralyze anyone she made eye contact with, Marry also acquired the ability to unify all of the \"snakes\".\n\n:After coming back to life, she lived in isolation for over a hundred years, greatly traumatized by her mother's death and terrified by the outside world. By chance, Seto visited the forest and befriended her, making her realize that the outside isn't so scary after all. He has since managed to bring her to the outside world and invited her to join the Mekakushi Dan.\n\n:After coming to the Mekakushi Dan's hideout and joining the group, she started a side job making fake flowers in her room, which generates a negligible income.

When Ayaka and Kenjir\u014d both died, Marry became completely guilt-ridden, believing that her being a \"monster\" caused the whole tragedy to happen. She also believes she herself is why the relationships between every member of the \"trio\" (including herself, and Ayano) had been \"changing\", stating this belief to Seto. Seto encourages her, explaining it's natural for human beings to \"change\", and implying it's not her fault. This event occurs after a scene in which Marry asks Kano, \"do you [[Love|like]] Kido?\", comparing Kano's feelings towards Kido and seeing them similar to those relationships seen in her fairy tale books (and claiming she read about it in a book). The specific word she uses in the Japanese edition is \"''suki''\", often used in romantic situations in Japan and between couples. Though Kano blushes and nervously denies such, Marry continued to press the question until Kano \"ran away\" to escape. The implication that the trio, Marry, and Ayano were all \"changing\" indicates that their former relationships had all thus \"changed\", in some cases drastically (such as their initially kicking Ayano out of the household) and in some cases not (such as Seto viewing Marry as a friend and human being, and the trio and Marry all viewing each other as \"friends\".).\n\n:It's also revealed in the same alternate second timeline of the manga that Marry's \"Queen\" (of the snakes) power here causes a great toll on her body as it slowly deteriorates her body to the point she can't move at all, possibly a result of her being more human than Medusa. Despite her cheerful personality, a monologue in the manga implies that while she loves her friends, she harbors a grudge against the world for taking everything from her, reflecting some of the attitudes her grandmother Azami and her mother Shion held towards humanity. She begins to absorb the powers of the snakes of her fallen comrades. The Mekakushi Dan members left, including her, would then attempt to face off against the snake of Clearing Eyes.\n\n:In the official spinoff series \"Mekakucity Talkers\", the \"Trio\" of Kido, Kano and Seto appears to now live at the Mekakushi Dan's hideout while both Ayano and Kenjirou are still alive and living at the Tateyama's household (Ayaka Tateyama, however, does not initially appear, and timeline differences seemingly occur in Talkers as well). Initially, including in earlier Talkers chapters, the Trio and the Tateyamas still appeared to function as a foster unit, such as when they talk about celebrating Kenjirou's birthday (Ayano, here seemingly alive, also appears at the household). However, later on in Talkers Chapter 29, a conversation occurs between Marry, Seto, Kano, and Shintar\u014d as they discuss \"siblings\". Marry claims she wants a \"brother\" (or, specifically, an \"''[[Japanese honorifics|onii-chan]]''\"-like figure), and targets the boys present in her \"search\" for an \"''onii-chan''\". Previously during the same chat, Shintar\u014d asks Kano if the Trio were \"kind of\" like siblings, to which Kano replies saying he doesn't believe he (Kano) has much \"''onii-chan'' power\" (\"big brother power\"), eventually implying Shintar\u014d has more of that than he does. Seto would later join in the conversation, agreeing with Kano as well (while also stating Shintar\u014d has the \"longest history as an ''Onii-chan''\"). The two frequently try to escape becoming Marry's \"''onii-chan''\", despite the earlier published alternative second manga storyline, and at one point Seto implies Marry calling him \"Seto-onii-chan\" feels weird (\"''Uh, that way of referring to me gives me a weird feeling... I wish you would drop it...''\") Eventually, the boys resolve the issue with Marry by them all agreeing they can be \"friends\" instead of siblings. Marry would later respond stating, \"I don't need an ''Onii-chan''. I [want to] go have fun with a friend.\"\n\n:Though she is referred to as a \"[[gorgon]]\" in the English localizations of the series, the Japanese translation, as well as Jin himself, have also referred to her instead being \"[[Medusa]]\". As well, her name is also frequently romanized as \"Mary\" and \"Marie\" in official Japanese materials, such as merchandise. All romanizations, including \"Marry\" (used in the English localization) are technically correct.\n\n:Marry's \"age\" Jin would later clarify himself on his official Twitter, stating: \"Since she didn't really count it, she herself didn't know her own age. So, on Marry's first birthday at the Mekakushi Dan's hideout, Kano told her that \"You'll be the same age as everyone then!!!\" while lighting 17 candles on the cake.\" \"The same age as everyone\" would refer to the \"Trio\" of Kano, Kido, and Seto all being around the same age (Kano 17, Kido and Seto 16 \"going-on\" 17). This exchange would imply Marry's \"age\" to be seen by her as being \"17\" as of July 21 (her official birthday). She also celebrates a birthday during the official spinoff series \"Mekakucity Talkers\", while already living at the Mekakushi Dan's hideout.\n\n;{{Nihongo|{{visible anchor|Momo}}|\u30e2\u30e2|Momo}} / {{Nihongo|{{visible anchor|Momo Kisaragi}}|\u5982\u6708 \u6843|Kisaragi Momo}}\n:{{voiced by|Nanami Kashiyama}}\n:Momo is member No. 5 of the Mekakushi Dan.

Unlike her brother, she does badly at school and is a clumsy yet cheerful girl. Momo's tastes are also shown to be rather strange. Her songs are {{Nihongo|\"Kisaragi Attention\"|\u5982\u6708\u30a2\u30c6\u30f3\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3}}, {{Nihongo|\"Otsukimi Recital\"|\u30aa\u30c4\u30ad\u30df\u30ea\u30b5\u30a4\u30bf\u30eb||\"Moon Viewing Recital\"}} (''with Hibiya Amamiya''), and {{Nihongo|\"Tomodachi no Uta\"|\u53cb\u9054\u306e\u5504|Song of Friends/A Song of My Friend}}.\n\n:When Momo was younger, she was constantly overshadowed by her brother Shintar\u014d causing her to yearn for attention. During a trip to the beach, she drowned in the ocean and was swallowed up by the Heat Haze, along with her father who had tried to save her and given the snake of \"Drawing Eyes\", which is capable of catching people's attention regardless of their preferences. At a fairly young age as a Junior High schooler, she gets a job as an idol, but she finds the constant attention and pressure miserable, lamenting that she just wants to be normal. It's here that she meets Kido, who explains the nature of their powers and offers to use teach Momo how to control her Drawing Eyes if she joins the Mekakushi Dan. Momo accepts, to Shintar\u014d's eventual chagrin.\n\n:In the manga's alternate timeline, she becomes the second victim of the Snake Of Clearing Eyes' killing spree, when she is thrown off a tall building by \"Hibiya Amamiya\" (as taken over by Clearing Eyes). Clearing Eyes (as \"Hibiya\") gets Momo to follow him when he asks for Momo's (referring to her as \"[[Japanese honorifics|onee-chan]]\") \"help\". (\"Please help me, ''onee-chan''.\") However, it's implied Momo knew something was wrong right away, as she reacts with a firm-looking expression and follows him; and likely recognizing he wasn't using \"oba-san\" or \"Aun\" (his \"ruder\" nicknames and \"honorific\") for her. This was incorrectly translated in the official English version of the manga; even though in the Japanese version and editions, the different honorifics are clearly displayed (including as [[kanji]]). Similar to this, in the novels, another instance occurs: Shintar\u014d recognizes right away Kano is posing as Momo when \"Momo\" (Kano) doesn't use the Japanese honorific \"''onii-chan''\" (lit. \"big brother\") for Shintar\u014d. (\"Momo calls me 'onii-chan', ''Kano''.\")\n\n:Though the script for Mekakucity Actors introduced her as being \"16\" years of age, as she is a 1st year high school student<ref name=\"http://mekakushidan.com/actors/momo\">{{cite web|url=http://mekakushidan.com/actors/momo|title=Mekakushi Dan Official Website|publisher=[[\u300cEDWORD RECORDS\u300d]]|date=October 4, 2018|accessdate=October 4, 2018}}</ref> in Japan (the series takes place in \"Kashiwa City\", and somewhere near [[Chiba Prefecture]]), she can chronologically only be \"15\" at the current point of the series (August 14th-17th), as she would not have her 16th birthday until the next years' February 14th. The [[Japanese Education|Japanese school year]] begins in April and ends in March; thus, she could only be 15 at the start of the school year with a birthday of February 14th. This inconsistency was acknowledged by the anime staff at an event for fans in Japan, and Momo's canonical grade of \"1st year high school student\" (10th grade) is stated on the official website.<ref name=\"http://mekakushidan.com/actors/momo\"/> She would later be shown as also the correct grade for her \"age\" range in both the manga's second alternate timeline and the sixth novel (\"Over the Dimension\"), showing her as a Junior High (equivalent to \"middle school\") schooler 2 years before the main series begins, when she'd be around 13-going-on-14 years of age and in the 8th grade.\n;{{Nihongo|{{visible anchor|Ene}}|\u30a8\u30cd|Ene}} / {{Nihongo|{{visible anchor|Takane Enomoto}}|\u698e\u672c \u8cb4\u97f3|Enomoto Takane}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Kana Asumi]]}}\n:Ene is member No. 6 of Mekakushi Dan.

Once a human named {{Nihongo|Takane Enomoto|\u698e\u672c \u8cb4\u97f3|Enomoto Takane}}, her personality as Ene is a cheerful prankster, a sharp contrast to Takane's pessimistic outlook at life.

Because of this, she was placed in a separate class at school with Haruka Kokonose, whom she harbored feelings for. As a human, Takane was ranked second in the country on a game called 'Dead Bullet -1989-' under the name of \"Senkou no Maihime\" (lit. Dancing Princess of the Spotlight)' and often stayed up late at night playing. This exacerbated her narcolepsy and made her irritable and bad-tempered at school. She died after being poisoned by Kenjir\u014d. Upon entering the Heat Haze, she is given the snake of \"Opening Eyes,\" giving her immortality through the ability to reside in digital objects. After becoming Ene, she was sent to Shintar\u014d's computer in an email from an unknown sender. Shintar\u014d refers to her as a 'virus' as she constantly plays pranks on him by deleting his files and threatening to upload his embarrassing poems on to the internet. Ene joins the Mekakushi Dan after helping to stop a terrorist attack at a local department store with Shintar\u014d.\n\n:In the manga's alternate timeline, she meets Haruka while both are hospitalized, and quickly bonds with him over video games. While she leaves, Haruka remains in the hospital, though she continues to talk to him. Upon seeing his fast friendship with Shintar\u014d, she stops talking to him out of jealousy. Later, she discovers that he had an attack and died and that shortly beforehand he had sketched her in his notebook. It is strongly implied that her regret caused her to commit suicide by jumping off the hospital building, at which point she entered the Heat Haze and became Ene.\n\n:Ene is not given an official age nor a birthday, her \"age\" being listed in Jin's 2012 \"Disintegration Book\" as being \"''???''\". However, Takane was in the same grade as Haruka, who were both a grade above Shintar\u014d and Ayano during high school (when Takane, Haruka, and Ayano were alive, 2 years before the main series begins). Despite rumors of such, Takane was also not given an official age nor birthday in any official canonical source.\n\n;{{Nihongo|{{visible anchor|Shintar\u014d}}|\u30b7\u30f3\u30bf\u30ed\u30fc|Shintar\u014d}} / {{Nihongo|{{visible anchor|Shintar\u014d Kisaragi}}|\u5982\u6708 \u4f38\u592a\u90ce|Kisaragi Shintar\u014d}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Takuma Terashima]]}} \n:Shintar\u014d is member No. 7 of Mekakushi Dan. He is the main protagonist of the story and has an IQ of 168. While he was in school, his intelligence caused him to have an apathetic personality. His songs are {{Nihongo|\"Lost Time Memory\"|\u30ed\u30b9\u30bf\u30a4\u30e0\u30e1\u30e2\u30ea\u30fc}} and {{Nihongo|\"T\u014dmei Answer\"|\u900f\u660e\u30a2\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc||\"Transparent Answer\"}}.\n\n:After a while, he became interested in the girl who sat next to him in class, Ayano Tateyama. Despite Ayano always acting cheerful and friendly towards him, Shintar\u014d would treat Ayano with something like coldness - though he is also shown to begin to regard Ayano at all, if not fully as a \"friend\". Ayano appears happy whenever Shintaro regards her. After Ayano's suicide, he falls into a deep depression and becomes a [[hikikomori]] addicted to the internet. A year after, he was \"sent\" a mysterious \"virus\" named Ene, and as he was unable to control her actions, his lifestyle was at a loss. After stopping a terrorist attack with Ene, he became involved with Mekakushi Dan. He would later come to possess the \"Retaining Eyes\", which allow him to remember all of the past (including all other previous routes and otherwise diverging timelines).\n\n:In the songs (\"Music Route\") Ayano's death results in two possible routes for the Mekakushi Dan, as shown in Lost Time Memory. In Route 1, also known as the Good End Route, Shintar\u014d (often portrayed in a red jersey) goes out and meets the Mekakushi Dan instead of staying at home and mourning Ayano. In Route XX, also known as the Bad End, Shintar\u014d (often portrayed in full black clothing), still mourning over Ayano's death at 18 years old, becomes fed up with Ene and kills her through unknown means, causing him to have a mental breakdown. The main Shintar\u014d dies while saving \"Kuroha\" (or, Clearing Eyes possessed Konoha) from shooting himself, while Route XX Shintar\u014d commits suicide by slitting his throat with a pair of red scissors. However, all of these events would supposedly lead to Shintar\u014d coming to possess \"Retaining Eyes\".\n\n:In the manga's alternate first and second timelines, Shintar\u014d is shown to have never met Ayano at all. However, after he dies in the first timeline, a \"vision\" (or \"dream\") of \"Ayano\" appears before him, asking him if Shintar\u014d knew why she died. After injuring himself in the new timeline he is hospitalized beside Haruka Kokonose, who serves the role of causing him to come out of his shell instead (and instead of Shintar\u014d meeting Haruka at school and becoming his, Ayano's, and Takane's classmate). When Haruka's illness causes him to have an attack and pass away, Shintar\u014d breaks down at the loss of his only friend and becomes a hikikomori like in the other timelines. It is later revealed Takane watched some of this happen from mostly afar (while going mostly unnoticed by Shintar\u014d and Haruka, when she tries to visit Haruka's hospital room to see Haruka). Takane would later seemingly commit suicide; becoming Ene, who again enters Shintar\u014d's life, and decides to help him come out of his shell herself this time. Shintar\u014d thus befriends Ene in a much different fashion from before, genuinely viewing her as a friend as time goes on. Together with Ene, Shintar\u014d and her would also play with the younger Junior High school aged Momo (Ene was even who seemed to pick out Momo's \"Aun\" hoodie). Shintar\u014d also watched over Momo from afar while she was in Junior High school, and as time went on, noticing her strange ability to attract attention even though he didn't understand it well at the time. In the manga's second timeline, he eventually would encounter Ayano again, this time as strangers; who requests his assistance.\n\n:Later on in the manga's alternate second timeline, he would officially join the Mekakushi Dan again. He does so by going to their new hideout, and encounters Ayano. Though Ayano initially tries to point out he doesn't have an eye power to protect himself while seeming [[Love|nervous]] by his presence; Shintar\u014d goes on to explain: he thought, if there was \"someone he could save\", he'll \"keep struggling\" to \"protect that person\", \"and that person can be no one else\" but Ayano herself. He declares he'll use all of his \"life force\" to \"fight\" for her, also declaring, \"I'm here to help you!\". Ayano responds by blushing terribly in her shock and surprise, and he is accepted into the Dan's hideout.\n\n:In the music video for the \"Music Route\" song \"Additional Memory\" (2018), it is revealed Ayano apparently loved Shintar\u014d since the very start all along, saying she didn't want to be \"just\" \"friends\". This revelation and seeming realization to herself occurs as she continuously falls from the buildings' rooftop, eventually waking up in the Heat Haze, appearing to herself as a classroom in monochrome colors while warped. Ayano sees the classroom from the sky as well, and seems to come to another realization; later encountering who appears to be Marry (in \"Queen\" form), while a physical snake (in snake form) appears above a then-leaning Ayano (as she leans in front of the also-kneeling Marry). Ayano would then go on to say (as she falls continuously, and seemingly not in person); \"I'm sorry\", \"''Sayonara''\", (lit. \"goodbye\" or \"farewell\"), and \"Daisuki da yo\" (lit: \"''I love you''\"), to who is indicated to be \"Shintar\u014d\" (seen as he looked previously in the beginning of the \"Lost Time Memory\" music video, where he walked with Ayano down the street to their school).\n\n;{{Nihongo|{{visible anchor|Hibiya}}|\u30d2\u30d3\u30e4|Hibiya}} / {{Nihongo|{{visible anchor|Hibiya Amamiya}}|\u96e8\u5bae \u97ff\u4e5f|Amamiya Hibiya}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Misuzu Togashi]]}}\n:Hibiya is member No. 8 of Mekakushi Dan. He is mentioned to be mature for his age and is shown to have an immense crush on Hiyori. In the novels and anime, he joins Mekakushi Dan after being spotted escaping the hospital he was at after an accident. His songs are {{Nihongo|\"Kagerou Daze\"|\u30ab\u30b2\u30ed\u30a6\u30c7\u30a4\u30ba||\"Heat Haze Daze\"}} and {{Nihongo|\"Otsukimi Recital\"|\u30aa\u30c4\u30ad\u30df\u30ea\u30b5\u30a4\u30bf\u30eb||\"Moon-viewing Recital\"}} (with Momo Kisaragi). Though it is not his song, he also appears in {{Nihongo|\"Konoha no Sekai Jij\u014d\"|\u30b3\u30ce\u30cf\u306e\u4e16\u754c\u4e8b\u60c5||\"Konoha's World Situation\"}}.\n\n:As a sixth-grade primary schooler, he is the youngest member of the group, at 12 years old (in \"Mekakucity Talkers\", he prepares to take Junior High exams, and later meets back up with Hiyori \"at school\" in what's initially implied to be a post-summer scenario.). He has the \"Eye Focusing\" ability, meaning he can see distant objects from an aerial view. He is originally from a village in the rural countryside and came with Hiyori Asahina to the city for the summer. He stayed at Hiyori's sister's house for the visit and met Konoha, who was living there at the time.\n\n:Hibiya sees Hiyori die in a traffic accident and somehow becomes stuck in a time loop trying to save her from dying, each time ending with him sacrificing himself to try and save Hiyori. He comes in contact with the Heat Haze and is given the snake of 'Focusing Eyes'.\n\n: In {{Nihongo|\"Konoha no Sekai Jij\u014d\"|\u30b3\u30ce\u30cf\u306e\u4e16\u754c\u4e8b\u60c5||\"Konoha's World Situation\"}}'s music video in \"music route\", Hibiya has seemingly \"switched\" the timeline, and is now the one dying repeatedly; while Hiyori is seen witnessing this, shocked and crying. Konoha tries to reach them both in time, but is unable to, as he is not visible physically at the time. Though they are different \"routes\", the novels appear to reference a similar event, as well - an upset Hibiya tells Konoha, \"''you were just standing there and watching!''\". The implication is that Hibiya actually ''could'' see Konoha during this point of time, at least, in the novels timeline. (The song contains the lines, from Konoha's point of view; \"With my wobbling see-through body; My hand won't reach them in time.\") In the 3rd novel, \"The Children Reason\", Shintar\u014d even references and repeats the line, when he discusses with Kido the possibility that Hibiya remembers the events of him being in the Heat Haze, both initially concluding that Hibiya ''did'' remember.\n\n:In the music, anime, and novels timeline, during \"Otsukimi Recital\", Hibiya is depressed because he hasn't been able to save Hiyori. Momo notices his depression, dragging him along to get him to partake in various \"fun\" events. In the music timeline, this involves things such as eating an extremely large meal (Hibiya only takes a bite), playing games at the arcade (where he slowly begins to seem to have fun), and trying on clothes and costumes (one of which involves Hibiya crossdressing while wearing a maid dress, as Momo gets him to do so.) The two later sit by the curb, where Hibiya's soda hits him in the eyes in a similar fashion to how Momo's own hit hers in \"Kisaragi Attention\". Momo continues to drag him along, and they reach a park. Hibiya begins to have flashbacks of Hiyori smiling, petting a cat, as Momo does the same thing, albeit getting scratched by one. As he begins crying again, Momo realizes the situation is desperate, and puts on a \"recital\" before him, encouraging him as her eyes turn red, drawing his attention. The full moon is visible behind them in the music video, relating to the song's title (\"Moon-viewing Recital\"), while in the anime, they are inside as she gives a performance on stage, again drawing his attention with her red eyes. At the end of the music video, he hesitantly reaches out for what seems to the viewer (and possibly him) as the back of Hiyori's dress; instead, he reaches Momo's hand. The two realize he's holding her hand, Momo getting an increasingly mischievous expression, while Hibiya becomes embarrassed and tries to look away. However, Momo grabs him by the hand and pulls him along happily, Hibiya now seemingly back to \"normal\". Shintar\u014d watches over them and his sister from afar with a grin (behind a tree), as does Kido, who is also there when Momo awakens after seemingly fainting from using her ability. In the novels, Momo and Hibiya head back. Hibiya proceeds to call Momo by only her name (\"Momo\"), instead of the rude nicknames he was using for her before (such as \"Aun\", similar to \"auntie\", implying she was middle aged, or \"old\"). Momo had previously requested he stop calling her those, and the fact Hibiya does so implies that their relationship became closer, by means of [[Japanese honorifics|yobisute]].\n\n:In the manga's second alternate timeline, Hibiya instead comes out of the Kagerou Daze with the Snake of Clearing Eyes, who proceeds to possess him and hunt down the Mekakushi Dan, after throwing Momo off a building. Clearing Eyes, using Hibiya's body, breaks through a window of the same building, falling far below. Clearing Eyes, still using Hibiya's body, then proceeds to speak to Konoha and the rest, telling them they can't change what is happening. Using Hibiya's body, Clearing Eyes moves towards the nearby street. While Hiyori runs to the scene from afar, Konoha chases after from a closer distance, reaching out with his hand in order to reach Hibiya - only to watch, yet again, as Clearing Eyes, possessing Hibiya, throws Hibiya's body into the street, right in front of the oncoming truck. As Hiyori approaches, watching in shock, Hibiya appears to finally regain his consciousness, before he tells Hiyori, \"I'm sorry\", eyes full of tears.\n\n:Though Hibiya and Konoha were both in front of the truck as it strikes, as Konoha was still reaching out for Hibiya; Clearing Eyes then uses the opportunity to jump to Konoha's body and leaves the scene. On the news Kano watches, three days passed since. Hibiya's corpse, as well as Momo's, were burned and thus unidentified. But since there were other wounds besides those caused by the \"accident\", there are chances the two were involved in some kind of case. Hibiya's status from then on is unknown.<ref>Kagerou Daze Manga</ref>\n\n:Because Hibiya's birthday is November 4th, and because it would take place before Ayano's birthday of November 22nd, he would be 13 during such a post-summer scenario, such as during the ending of Mekakucity Actors. In comparison, Hiyori's birthday, March 3rd, would place her on the \"younger\" end of her school year (the [[Education in Japan|Japanese school year]] begins in April and ends in late March.) This is also despite Hibiya and Hiyori's official ages not matching up with a real-world based timeline.\n\n;{{Nihongo|{{visible anchor|Konoha}}|\u30b3\u30ce\u30cf|Konoha}} / {{Nihongo|{{visible anchor|Haruka Kokonose}}|\u4e5d\u30ce\u702c \u9065|Kokonose Haruka}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Mamoru Miyano]]}}\n:Konoha is member No. 9 of Mekakushi Dan. Shown to be a rather absent-minded individual, he has a large appetite, similar to his human self as Haruka. His songs are {{Nihongo|\"Konoha no Sekai Jij\u014d\"|\u30b3\u30ce\u30cf\u306e\u4e16\u754c\u4e8b\u60c5||\"Konoha's World Situation\"}}, {{Nihongo|\"Y\u016bkei Yesterday\"|\u5915\u666f\u30a4\u30a8\u30b9\u30bf\u30c7\u30a4||\"Yesterday Evening\"}} (as Haruka), {{Nihongo|\"Outer Science\"|\u30a2\u30a6\u30bf\u30fc\u30b5\u30a4\u30a8\u30f3\u30b9}} (as Black Konoha), and {{Nihongo|\"Summertime Record\"|\u30b5\u30de\u30fc\u30bf\u30a4\u30e0\u30ec\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9}} (as both, or Haruka).\n\n:As a human, Haruka suffered from an illness which caused him to have \"attacks\" and collapse, making him have less time to live, hence making him wish for a body that would not be as vulnerable, and hence being placed in a separate class with Takane Enomoto. With the interference of Kenjir\u014d, he suffers an attack and dies, entering the Heat Haze with Takane, and therefore receiving the \"Awakening Eyes\" ability, which allows him to live in his ideal body. However, instead of being sent back like the others in the Heat Haze, Haruka stayed in the Heat Haze while the Snake of Awakening Eyes inhabits his body as Konoha, attempting to carry on Haruka's wishes of spending time with his friends. After this, the amnesiac Konoha stays at Ayaka's house, where he meets Hibiya and Hiyori and attempts to save them from the Heat Haze.\n\n:Though Konoha is born from such means, he is seen as being overall different from Haruka - Takane even noting such in the anime (and Ene thus calling Konoha \"imposter\") and is treated as being his own person. He is noted to have an \"[[Immortality|immortal]] body\".<ref name=\"Kagerou Daze Disintegration Book 2012\"/>\n\n:In \"Summertime Record\", the \"ending theme\" for the overall series, Konoha appears to \"join\" with Haruka's body, disappearing, and Haruka gaining Konoha's same mark on his cheek, as well as a slightly changed look. The specific events that lead to this occurrence were unknown. However, the various other endings show alternative fates for Konoha - in the anime, Konoha appears to disappear, Haruka regaining his physical body (only seen in the shadows, from afar), and Konoha's shadow briefly \"seen\" (to the viewer) running separately; in \"in a Day's\", the MX4D short movie, Konoha is instead seen leaving together with the rest of the Mekakushi Dan after they stop the terrorist incident all together (sans Ayano, and with both Hibiya and Hiyori, as well as Ene instead of Takane) only to be implied killed (with the rest) by the hidden bomb underneath the building at the end, Clearing Eyes seemingly never appearing; in the manga's first timeline, he is possessed by Clearing Eyes, and kills the then-formed Mekakushi Dan (sans Hibiya or Hiyori, who were instead unable to enter the mall due to an incident, and left outside of it; only to still have the timeline repeated) very early on; in the manga's second timeline, he is taken over by Clearing Eyes yet again after it leaves Hibiya's body, which Clearing Eyes possessed. In the \"Mekakucity Talkers\" spinoff, Konoha is again seen still \"alive\" along with the rest of the Mekakushi Dan (sans Hiyori, and with Hibiya, as well as Ayano and Ene). The implication that Hibiya is studying for Junior High school and later returns to school (\"after\" the summer would be over, while meeting up with Hiyori \"at school\") seems to imply Konoha (as Konoha, and possibly not Haruka) as well lives past \"an\" August 15th-18th in that timeline, if temporarily. However, Talkers would also later (in Chapter 31) bring up the location of the \"amusement park\" in passing.\n\n:An alternate version of Konoha appears in Outer Science, notably during the \"Music Route\", called Black Konoha (also dubbed as Kuroha by Japanese fans, {{Nihongo|''kuro''|\u9ed2}} meaning 'black'), and kills everyone in Route XX. In Route 1 (notably during \"Lost Time Memory\", in \"Music Route\") for unknown reasons, he attempts to shoot himself in the head, only to be saved by Shintar\u014d; \"Kuroha\"'s eyes widening in shock as he watches Shintar\u014d fall (it is unknown if the one shocked in \"Music Route\" was Konoha, or Clearing Eyes himself). In the anime, \"Kuroha\" is revealed to be the snake of 'Clearing Eyes', Kenjir\u014d's eye ability, which has transferred itself to Konoha (termed \"forming\" in him) and possessed him, believing him to be a stronger vessel.\n\n;{{Nihongo|{{visible anchor|Ayano}}|\u30a2\u30e4\u30ce|Ayano}} / {{Nihongo|{{visible anchor|Ayano Tateyama}}|\u696f\u5c71 \u6587\u4e43|Tateyama Ayano}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Mai Nakahara]]}}\n:Ayano is member No. 0 of the Mekakushi Dan and was the daughter of Kenjir\u014d and Ayaka Tateyama.

After the death of her mother in a landslide and the discovery that her father was experimenting on her friends in an attempt to bring her back to life, Ayano grew increasingly concerned of the safety of the \"trio\". She committed suicide by jumping off the roof of her school in an attempt to save her family and friends from the plot of the snake that gives Kenjir\u014d the 'Clearing Eyes.' She gets possessed by a snake and obtains the 'Favoring Eyes,' which allows her to project her thoughts and emotions unto others.\n\n:In the manga's alternate first timeline, she is there with Marry when the landslide happens, now killing both her parents. She receives Favoring Eyes as a result, as well as the memories of Azami. Becoming far more stoic and cynical, she comes to the conclusion that to save the trio from harm, she must kill Marry, the catalyst of the tragedies to come. Kido punches Ayano hard enough to draw blood (reflecting a similar incident from their past when they were younger, and Kido was still new to the household) but Ayano doesn't change her mind. Extremely angered, shocked, and fearing for Marry's well-being and life, the trio then kick Ayano completely out of the house, cutting all ties with Ayano. In turn, she never meets Shintar\u014d or her other school friends, but also doesn't remain trapped in the Daze. Unfortunately, her relationships with all of the trio worsened to an extreme as a result as well. When meeting her again, Kano addresses her extremely coldly as \"''o''nee-chan\" (formal [[Japanese honorifics|Japanese honorific]], meaning similar to \"big sister\") instead of \"''n''ee-chan\" (informal [[Japanese honorifics|Japanese honorific]], meaning similar to \"sister\"), something he had never done before that. As the manga's storyline continued, many further events would eventually lead to Kano reconciling with Ayano, reinstating her \"''n''ee-chan\", however, she would be unable to reconcile in person with the already dead Kido, and Seto who was busy at the time taking care of Marry.\n\n:In the fifth novel \"The Deceiving\", alternative events would again occur from other timelines, in which a young Kano meets young Ayano at the park one day, a short time before he initially dies being killed during a robbery (and before they would have met at her household), and thus meeting as strangers at the park. Ayano swung from the metal bar at the park, only to then have a brief conversation with Kano, in which he didn't reveal his name to her (and she didn't get to reveal hers to him). Kano would then come to mentally describe Ayano as \"Park Girl\", remembering her to the point of being able to take on her form, including while at the orphanage, before they meet the Tateyamas and Ayano again later on, and again are fostered<ref name=\"mekakushidan.com\">{{cite web|url=http://mekakushidan.com/actors/ayano|title=Mekakushi Dan Official Website|publisher=[[\u300cEDWORD RECORDS\u300d]]|date=September 29, 2018|accessdate=September 29, 2018}}</ref> temporarily at the household. This event does not seemingly occur in any other timeline but the novels.\n\n:An Ayano that Shintar\u014d meets at some times (in the real world) is revealed to also be Kano (including in the novels) using his \"Deceiving\" ability, who does so to spite Shintar\u014d, whom he believes caused Ayano's death. However, Kano would later apologize for the incidents in the seventh novel (\"From the Darkness\") and Shintar\u014d forgives him, genuinely befriending Kano. Kano would go on to believe (thinking to himself) he was no match for Shintar\u014d. Kano also notes to himself Shintar\u014d would \"show a different kind of smile\" to \"Ayano only\"; then thinking Shintar\u014d showed \"that kind of smile\" to Kano himself as well, showing they fully reconcile.\n\n:An Ayano that Shintar\u014d meets in the Heat Haze at other times is revealed to be his own snake, taking on her form wearing her black school uniform, but without her red scarf.\n\n:In the short novel \"My Little Daze\", an encounter and first meeting with Shintar\u014d at Junior High school 2 years before the main series begins is told through her point of view (as his point of view is told in the drama CD track for the same event). There, she meets Shintar\u014d for the first time in Junior High school. She initially mistakes Shintar\u014d for a girl because of his surname (\"Kisaragi\") sounding feminine, being slightly shocked when she learns he is a boy. This information is revealed to her through a female teacher at the school, who Ayano speaks with after the teacher notices Ayano in a daze during a ceremony (Ayano herself describing it as a \"daze\", while she had been imagining what it'd be like to be a \"hero\", as her father talked of). When the teacher glares at Ayano, Ayano describes it as similar to a \"frog that was being glared at by a snake\". The teacher lets Ayano go, revealing Shintar\u014d was male, and Ayano would then meet Shintar\u014d in person. Though Shintar\u014d treats her same as he always does at the start, in the drama CD track and short novel, he appears to also be regarding Ayano while doing so. Ayano later asks Shintar\u014d to tutor her, and Shintar\u014d agrees \"just for today\" after an initial pause. Ayano was \"so happy\" she \"felt like jumping up and down, but figured that was probably a bad idea, and stopped\" herself. She asks if they would \"finally\" \"be able to become friends\", asks if her \"pounding chest\" was going to be \"able\" to \"stand this\", then concludes, \"no\", she was \"going to be fine\". Her father once told her \"A pounding chest is the proof of justice\", so she was \"definitely going to be fine\". The entire story from both forms of media appears to reflect the beginning of \"Transparent Answer\"'s music video in the \"Music Route\", albeit told in a different way, and with different events and perhaps results. As Ayano also does not mention the \"trio\" of Kido, Kano, and Seto at all during this entire monologue, it is unknown if they would take the trio into her household in this series of events. Before the series was adapted into other published media such as the manga, novels and anime, Ayano was also never described in connection with the trio until the \"Ayano's Theory of Happiness\" music video debuted, revealing a connection there, before the anime. She was instead described initially as \"taking care of her father and friend\", implied to be Kenjir\u014d and Shintar\u014d respectively, during a timeline where only her mother died.<ref name=\"Mekakushi Dan Official Website\"/><ref name=\"Kagerou Daze Disintegration Book 2012\"/><ref>Daze/Days cd \"My Little Daze\" Short Story</ref>\n\n:In Route 1, after Shintar\u014d (in red jersey) meets the real Ayano in the Heat Haze, she passes her eye ability to him.\n\n:In the music video for the \"Music Route\" song \"Additional Memory\", it is revealed she apparently loved Shintar\u014d since the very start all along, saying she didn't want to be \"just\" \"friends\". This revelation and seeming realization to herself occurs as she continuously falls from the buildings' rooftop, eventually waking up in the Daze, appearing to her as a warped classroom in monochrome colors and covered in flowers. Ayano sees the classroom from the sky as well, and seems to come to another realization; later encountering who appears to be Marry (in \"Queen\" form), while a physical snake (in snake form) appears above a then-leaning Ayano (as she leans in front of the also-kneeling Marry). Ayano would then go on to say (as she falls continuously, and seemingly not in person); \"I'm sorry\", \"''Sayonara''\", (lit. \"goodbye\" or \"farewell\"), and \"Daisuki da yo\" (lit: \"''I love you''\"), to who is indicated to be \"Shintar\u014d\" (seen as he looked previously in the beginning of the \"Lost Time Memory\" music video, where he walked with Ayano down the street to their school).\n\n:She is stated to have initially died during her first year of [[Education in Japan|high school]], when she would still be about 15 years old (as the event of her death happens on August 15th, while her birthday isn't until November 22nd); however, she was also in the same class as Shintar\u014d, being his classmate, thus making them close in age. Since Shintar\u014d (with an April 30th birthday) is already 18 during the main series, Ayano would be 18 post-series (by November 22nd) when \"alive\" as well. (In the official spinoff series \"Mekakucity Talkers\", [[autumn]] is also implied approaching, in Chapter 31. The format of the real-world [[Education in Japan|Japanese school year]], which begins April 1st and ends in late March, also implies Ayano's age range.)\n\n===Other characters===\n;{{Nihongo|{{visible anchor|Kenjir\u014d}}|\u30b1\u30f3\u30b8\u30ed\u30a6|Kenjir\u014d}} / {{Nihongo|{{visible anchor|Kenjir\u014d Tateyama}}|\u696f\u5c71\u3000\u7814\u6b21\u6717|Tateyama Kenjir\u014d}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Keiji Fujiwara]]}}\n:Kenjir\u014d is the father of Ayano and husband of Ayaka.

Kenjir\u014d was interested in the theory of Medusae and researched it with Ayaka, only to be caught in a landslide with her and die. He came in contact with the Heat Haze and was possessed by the snake of 'Clearing Eyes'. He became much more engrossed in research after Ayaka's death, eventually experimenting on and killing his two students (Takane and Haruka), this was done while possessed by the snake of 'Clearing Eyes'. His fate is that he dies and reunites with Ayaka in the Heat Haze; in Route XX, the snake of 'Clearing Eyes' (while it is possessing Konoha) kills him.\n\n;{{Nihongo|{{visible anchor|Hiyori}}|\u30d2\u30e8\u30ea|Hiyori}} / {{Nihongo|{{visible anchor|Hiyori Asahina}}|\u671d\u6bd4\u5948 \u65e5\u548c|Asahina Hiyori}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Kotori Koiwai]]}}\n:Hiyori is a stubborn young girl from the countryside who yearns for the city. She is very popular at her school and has her own fan club. She drags Hibiya to the city with her in order to get Momo's autograph and stays at her sister's, Ayaka, house. She falls in love with Konoha who was staying there at the time. She becomes involved in a traffic accident and gets stuck in a time loop trying to save Hibiya, but while Hibiya successfully escapes the Heat Haze, she passes away. Despite her apparent pessimistic personality and constant insults she uses towards Hibiya, she truly cares about him. She seemingly thinks of him as an important person; since she never saw her distant older sister before her sister's death; and, because of her popularity that makes it harder for her to be friends with others. She appears in {{Nihongo|\"Kagerou Daze\"|\u30ab\u30b2\u30ed\u30a6\u30c7\u30a4\u30ba||\"Heat Haze Daze\"}} together with Hibiya, who mostly tells the song through his point of view, changing to Hiyori's only in the final verse. She also appears in {{Nihongo|\"Konoha no Sekai Jij\u014d\"|\u30b3\u30ce\u30cf\u306e\u4e16\u754c\u4e8b\u60c5||\"Konoha's World Situation\"}}, now witnessing Hibiya dying, while shocked and crying. Konoha tries to reach them both in time, but is unable to, as he is not visible physically at the time.\n\n:In the manga's alternative second timeline, she became one of the protagonists. After entering the Heat Haze by what seems to be an \"accident\", she seemingly gained the 'Focusing Eyes' in Hibiya's stead as he was the one who received the 'Clearing Eyes' instead. Hiyori eventually helps the Mekakushi Dan after the aftermath of the 'Clearing Eyes' incident.\n\n:In the final novel for the novels' timeline (\"Summer Time Reload\"), Hiyori eventually became an official member of the Mekakushi Dan sometime after the aftermath of witnessing Hibiya dying repeatedly in previous timelines. She is \"invited\", or \"forced\", by Ene, who she describes as the \"noisy blue girl\", to become the now officially \"10th\" member.\n\n:Because Hibiya's birthday is November 4th, and because it would take place before Ayano's birthday of November 22nd, he would be 13 during such a post-summer scenario, such as during the ending of Mekakucity Actors. In comparison, Hiyori's birthday, March 3rd, would place her on the \"younger\" end of her school year (the [[Education in Japan|Japanese school year]] begins in April and ends in late March.) This is also despite Hibiya and Hiyori's official ages not matching up with a real-world based timeline.\n\n;{{Nihongo|{{visible anchor|Shion}}|\u30b7\u30aa\u30f3|Shion}} / {{Nihongo|{{visible anchor|Shion Kozakura}}|\u5c0f\u685c \u7d2b\u82d1|Kozakura Shion}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Akemi Okamura]]}}\n:Shion is a 1/2 medusa and Marry's mother.

One day, Marry bypasses her mother's orders and plays outside anyways, however some boys come to attack her. She sacrifices herself in order to save Marry, and uses her eye power to turn the boys to stone; but the strain on her body was too much and she passes away with Marry.\n\n:She gets consumed by the Heat Haze and is given the 'Combining Eyes' ability, however she passes the power on to Marry and sends her to the outside world.

Snakes grow from her hair, each with a unique power. She once thought humans were 'dull creatures that die easily' but fell in love with a human named Tsukihiko and started a family. After realizing how short human lives were compared to her immortality, she goes away to use the power of the snakes to create a Never Ending World (The Heat Haze) where she could live with her family forever. It is currently unclear if she waited for her family to arrive in the Heat Haze, before realising that her husband would have died by then, or that when she returned, the villagers attacking her house made her revert to her original ideology, causing her to return to the Never-Ending World alone.\n:Many years later, her daughter and granddaughter, Shion and Marry were killed on August 15. Knowing this, she was unable to bear her grief and ordered the Heat Haze to \"bring in every person who died on August 15\", giving the ability of 'Combining Eyes' to Shion to allow her to return to life (who gave it to Marry). This causes her to lose control of the Heat Haze, thus drawing in every person who had died on August 15, the day Marry died, it is presumed that she died due to her power completely taken over by him and eventually suffocating to her death. Her body is later used by the Snake of The Clearing Eyes so that he might able to use her power to find a perfect vessel for him which is Konoha, In the end, she finally able to peacefully die with Shion by her side, finally freed from the torture she has been suffering for very many years.

Its true goal, however, is living forever. Also in many timelines, it transfers itself to Konoha's body and possesses it, causing Konoha's appearance to change into a \"darker\" look as well (wearing a full black version of Konoha's clothing, and with black hair).<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n:However, in the manga's alternate second timeline, he initially possesses Hibiya Amamiya instead, only body-jumping to Konoha later on (after killing Hibiya, by throwing Hibiya while Clearing Eyes is still using his body into the path of an incoming truck). Konoha was trying to reach Hibiya in time, but is unable to. Though both Hibiya and Konoha are seen in \"front\" of the truck just before it strikes, Clearing Eyes would then body-jump to Konoha, as the truck kills Hibiya, surrounding them with fire.\n\n:In many timelines, it then kills all the members of the Mekakushi Dan besides Marry, and has her reset the timeline. This happens by means of her Combining Eyes ability, used through her by the snake of 'Clearing Eyes', who \"awakens\" her<ref name=\"Kagerou Daze Disintegration Book 2012\"/>(often in \"Queen\" form), and, by \"collecting\" the snakes that \"have lost their owners\",<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> she reverses time in order to save everyone. Marry seemingly reverses time at the end of every official \"route\" and \"timeline\" seen thus far.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n:However, in the manga's alternate second timeline, Clearing Eyes takes on a new \"look\" for the first time, discarding Konoha's previous form while still seemingly in use of Konoha's body. On his body, notably his arms and legs, his skin takes on hues of pure black (also coming from the shadows surrounding him) while fading into a dark red [[color gradient]], his eyes being the same glowing dark red. Snake-like skin covers the top half of his face and cheeks, leaving the area around his mouth a light grey. His spiky hair hangs downwards, a large and long piece of which falling between his eyes, while two other equally long strands also frame his face.\n\n:It's also revealed in the same alternate second timeline of the manga that Marry's \"Queen\" (of the snakes) power here causes a great toll on her body as it slowly deteriorates her body to the point she can't move at all, possibly a result of her being more human than gorgon. Despite her cheerful personality, a monologue in the manga implies that while she loves her friends, she harbors a grudge against the world for taking everything from her, reflecting some of the attitudes her grandmother Azami and her mother Shion held towards humanity. She begins to absorb the powers of the snakes of her fallen comrades. The Mekakushi Dan members left, including her, would then attempt to face off against the snake of Clearing Eyes.\n\n:In the anime's timeline, it is seemingly \"defeated\" when Kenjir\u014d's wish is granted and it has to comply to Konoha's wish, which was bringing Hiyori back life, so it becomes her surrogate life. It is eventually revealed that he was powered by the souls that were trapped in the haze. The Heat Haze was in fact not only created by Azami, but powered by the \"wishes\" of people who died on August 14th-15. Anybody who died on those days can't move into the afterlife at all, until someone with gorgon blood (Marry) who can use the Combining Eyes repeats the current timeline. Repeating the timeline in turn (seemingly) stops the haze and frees all of the dead souls that are trapped inside. This appears to permanently weaken the Snake of Clearing Eyes.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n:However, the \"Kagerou Project Perfect Guide\" (2016) would then reveal most \"routes\", or timelines, are repeated after all; including seemingly the initial anime's.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> The MX4D short film's \"route\" seemingly does not contain Clearing Eyes at all, though it contains very different events from the initial anime's timeline, as the near-full Mekakushi Dan (sans Ayano, and with Ene, Konoha, Hibiya, and Hiyori all together) appear to stop the mall \"incident\"'s terrorist attack on their own and together, defeating other \"new\" characters who appear as the terrorists. However, at the end of the MX4D, a bomb is seen at the end, ticking down to zero, and indicating the timeline reset. It is unknown if Clearing Eyes exists in this timeline due to him not appearing physically or being referred to; however, the similar initial events (specifically, the start of the mall incident) may indicate he does. In the novels, it was also revealed he controlled nearly all of the city, including officials.\n\n:In a short manga \"Marry no Kak\u016b Sekai\" (\u30de\u30ea\u30fc\u306e\u67b6\u7a7a\u4e16\u754c, \"Marry's Fictional World\"), published near the start of the manga's alternate second timeline, Clearing Eyes faces Marry, who proceeds to use her power to turn him into stone. As she does so, Clearing Eyes, as \"Black Konoha\", with a bloodied scratch on his cheek and eyes widened in shock, surprise, and possibly even hurt, begins to become stone. However, Marry was later awoken at the Mekakushi Dan hideout by a worried Momo (the trio also being present). Marry would smile through her tears, realizing it was a \"dream\". This short manga having the same title as the song of the same name, where Marry sings and indicating herself repeating timelines so she can continue to remain with her friends, indicates it may not have completely been a \"dream\". \"Marry no Kak\u016b Sekai\" (\u30de\u30ea\u30fc\u306e\u67b6\u7a7a\u4e16\u754c, \"Marry's Fictional World\") is also included by title at the end of routes similar to \"Route XX\", especially notable at the very end of the initial music \"route\", where it is placed after the events of \"Konoha no Sekai Jij\u014d\" (\u30b3\u30ce\u30cf\u306e\u4e16\u754c\u4e8b\u60c5, \"Konoha's World Situation\") and \"Kagerou Daze\" (\u30ab\u30b2\u30ed\u30a6\u30c7\u30a4\u30ba, \"Heat Haze Daze\") (which occur at the same time as each other), leading into \"Outer Science\" (\u30a2\u30a6\u30bf\u30fc\u30b5\u30a4\u30a8\u30f3\u30b9) and concluding with \"Marry no Kak\u016b Sekai\" (\u30de\u30ea\u30fc\u306e\u67b6\u7a7a\u4e16\u754c, \"Marry's Fictional World\") along with a repeat.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n== Media ==\n===CD / DVDs===\nThe series began as a series of albums that were released alongside the novels.

They say goodbye to each other, and if they can remember; maybe they will all meet again.\n\nHowever, in the \"Kagerou Project Perfect Guide\" (2016), multiple more \"Routes\" and otherwise timelines were confirmed; \"Mekakucity Actors\" (which contained this song) stated to be one of the \"Routes\", which may have been \"repeated\" after all; heavily implying more potential \"Routes\" were to come.\n| LineColor           = 3fa8e2\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = ?\n| Title               = Daze\n| TranslitTitle       = deizu\n| NativeTitle         = \u30c7\u30a4\u30ba\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| ShortSummary        = The opening theme for the \"Mekakucity Actors\" anime.

It is sung by Lia, who also provided her voice for the Vocaloid IA, commonly used by Jin to make Kagerou Project songs. The song was composed by Shizen no Teki-P/Jin.\n\nIn the ending theme for the anime, illustrated by Sidu, Hiyori Asahina sits alone in a dark subway car, as the rest of the Mekakushi Dan slowly begin appearing around her, everyone in shadows. Most of the members appear to be sleeping, with Shintaro and some others keeping watch. The first one to appear by Hiyori's side is Hibiya Amamiya, sleeping against her in a similar fashion to an earlier scene from the end of \"Konoha's World Situation\", though the Hiyori here seems less natural, and more composed; a small, peaceful smile on her face the entire time. Konoha, as well, would soon appear sleeping against her other side. Suddenly, everyone around her vanishes, revealing Hiyori appearing to be alone; as she soon quickly fades away herself.\n\nAn official music video (also illustrated by Sidu) was also later released, this time showing Azami surrounded by her family, husband Tsukihiko and daughter Shion, in a much brighter looking subway car. However, as the video goes on, \"glitch\"-like things begin happening, and her family soon disappears. Azami begins crying as the imagery becomes somewhat darker. Suddenly, she opens her eyes, only to see a view of Hiyori Asahina in the subway car, surrounded by her sleeping (or otherwise) friends; the same as shown in the \"Mekakucity Actors\" ending theme.\n\nIt is unknown which one exactly sings the song (and may be both, in their different versions), also as Azami's version referenced the earlier Hiyori's/Mekakucity Actors' version. However, the lyrics appear to relate to both characters.\n| LineColor           = 3fa8e2\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = ?\n| Title               = RED\n| TranslitTitle       = Reddo\n| NativeTitle         = \u30ec\u30c3\u30c9\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| ShortSummary        = The opening theme song for \"-in a day's-\" performed by GOUACHE, a band that Jin is a part of.\n\nThe music video is a compilation video directed by Toushi Atsunori.

It started as a [[Vocaloid]] song series created by {{nihongo|Jin (Shizen no Teki-P)|\u3058\u3093(\u81ea\u7136\u306e\u6575P)||}}. The story revolves around the Mekakushi Dan, a group of young people with unusual eye-related powers.\n\nThe series became infamous on the video sharing website [[Niconico]] after the release of the music video and song for \"Kagerou Week\", which primarily featured character Hibiya Amamiya (supporting character Hiyori Asahina referred to only in the song's lyrics), also gave the series its name. The song has amassed over 10 million views and is the most popular song of the project. Eight light novels have been released, written by Jin and illustrated by {{nihongo|Sidu|\u3057\u3065|Shizu}}. A manga adaptation with illustrations by {{nihongo|Mahiro Satou|\u4f50\u85e4\u307e\u3072\u308d|Sat\u014d Mahiro|}}, began serialization in ''[[Monthly Comic Gene]]'' on June 15, 2012, also written by Jin. A 12-episode anime adaptation titled {{nihongo|'''''Mekakucity Actors'''''|\u30e1\u30ab\u30af\u30b7\u30c6\u30a3\u30a2\u30af\u30bf\u30fc\u30ba|Mekakushiti Akut\u0101zu|lit. \"Blindfold-city Actors\"}}\u2014\"Mekakucity\" being a [[portmanteau]] of \"mekakushi\" (\"blindfold\" in Japanese) and \"city\"\u2014aired between April 12 and June 28, 2014. The series was directed by Akiyuki Shinbo and Y\u016bki Yase, and animated at [[Shaft (company)|Shaft]], with the script also written by Jin.\n\n==Plot==\nShintar\u014d Kisaragi of \"Kashiwa City\", Japan is an 18-year-old [[hikikomori|hiki]]-[[NEET]] who has not left his room in two years, engrossing himself with his computer and the internet. However, on August 14, due to the messing about of the cyber girl Ene, who lives inside his computer, Shintar\u014d spills soda on his computer keyboard and is forced to go outside to buy a new one, due to the fact that during the Obon festival none of the stores will deliver until August 17. (In the manga's second alternate storyline, he goes to buy food for his female pet rabbit; Tono.) Shintar\u014d goes to the department store, where a group of criminals break in and hold the people inside hostage for ransom. Here he comes in contact with a group of people calling themselves the {{nihongo|\"Mekakushi Dan\"|\u30e1\u30ab\u30af\u30b7\u56e3||lit. \"Blindfold Gang\"}}, who stop the robbery with their mysterious eye powers and \"force\" Shintar\u014d to join into their group.\n\nBefore this occurs, Shintar\u014d's younger sister, Momo Kisaragi, is a popular idol and first-year high school student who has the ability to attract people's attention. This is due to the \"Drawing Eyes\" ability, which she cannot control and causes people to look at her wherever she goes. One day, while fleeing from a horde of fans, she meets the Mekakushi Dan leader, Tsubomi Kido, who invites Momo to join, which she does. \n\nWhile meeting the first four members of the Mekakushi Dan, Marry trips and gets Momo's phone wet, and the Mekakushi Dan all go to the department store to buy a new phone for Momo. Kido uses her ability to keep people from staring at Momo, but while in the store, they find out Shintar\u014d is there at the same time. The terrorists break in and take all the shoppers hostage, but with Kido's eye power, she, Momo, Marry, Seto, and Kano are invisible and thus do not get caught. They work together to stop the heist, though Shintar\u014d passes out, and they bring him to their hideout and introduce him and Ene as members once the former awakens. Afterwards, they all go to the amusement park to have fun. However, further events begin to unfold.\n\nThe prologue for the novels' storyline is told in the second novel, ''-a headphone actor-''. Takane Enomoto and Haruka Kokonose, students of Kenjir\u014d Tateyama, plan a class booth for their school's cultural festival. Haruka gets an idea to host a shooting booth; however, this idea could not be fulfilled due to Kenjir\u014d spending all their booth funds on a rare specimen. Takane, being a highly-skilled gamer, decides that instead of a shooting booth with a large amount of equipment, they should make a video game of a first-person shooter. Kenjir\u014d would be in charge of programming, Haruka was in charge of illustration and Takane was responsible for playing as the opponent. Their plan captured a great amount of attention, good and bad.\n\nThe series contains alternative storylines, endings (and in some cases, beginnings) depending on the format of the media, called \"routes\".<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">\"Kagerou Project Perfect Guide\" (2016)</ref>\n\n* Music Route, occurring between the years 2011-2013 initially and otherwise beyond, is the original first \"route\". It comes first in the official \"timelines\" order. It contains all of the official music videos for the \"Kagerou Project\" songs, with music by Jin, and animations by Wannyanp\u016b and Sidu (later only Sidu).<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Many notable songs, however, are left out of the initial, chronological \"music route\" described, though they are stated to still be included in the overall route. \"Lost Time Memory\" in Music Route splits into \"Route XX\", \"Route 1\", and \"Route 2\", with \"XX\" being a \"bad ending\", \"1\" leading to the main storyline, and \"2\" implied a \"good ending\".<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n* Manga Route, published between the years 2012 (June) and currently, comes second in the official \"timelines\" order. Though it debuted in June 2012, Jin confirmed he was working on the manga earlier on, writing the story for it as of \"Konoha's World Situation\"'s music video release in May 2012. The manga would later split into two alternate timelines, the second following drastically different events from the first.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n* Novels Route, published between the years 2012 (May) through 2017 (2018 for the US release), comes after Manga Route and seemingly before the Mekakucity Actors anime in the official \"timelines\" order.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n* Mekakucity Actors Route, the initially airing anime which aired beginning of April 2014 through June 2014, was not included in the official timelines of the \"Kagerou Project Perfect Guide\" (2016); however, the anime itself signifies more initially conclusive events. The lack of inclusion in the official timelines, despite its existence at the time, seems to indicate it comes after them as well.\n* Kagerou Daze -in a day's- (\u30ab\u30b2\u30ed\u30a6\u30c7\u30a4\u30ba-in a day's-) is an MX4D produced an animated short movie in which the Mekakushi Dan join together to once again stop an incident occurring at the mall. This Mekakushi Dan consists of Dan members 1-7 initially, and also containing Ene, Hibiya Amamiya, Konoha, and Hiyori Asahina. This is despite many notable events of the previous \"routes\". Certain other members related to the Dan do not appear in this \"route\", while instead \"new\" characters do; however, the \"new\" characters' identities were kept somewhat secret, including their names. An initial promotion for the film described it as a \"Route-2\", though the events contained seem wholly different to the \"Route-2\" that occurs in \"Lost Time Memory\"'s music video. The \"new\" characters were created specifically for this film.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nVarious other (including smaller or shorter) \"timelines\" are also contained within major \"routes\" or other side materials. These are all indicated in detail in the \"Kagerou Project Perfect Guide\" (2016).<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> While many \"timelines\" occur between the dates of August 14\u201315 (and in some cases a short time beyond, such as August 17, among other dates) some \"timelines\"'s initial storylines are indicated to happen before the \"main\" series begins. This often involves the backstories of the \"trio\" of Kido, Kano, and Seto and their encounters, on their own or otherwise, and notably involving supporting characters Ayano Tateyama, and Mekakushi Dan member Marry Kozakura (notably detailing her meeting with character Seto). Yet more timelines occur detailing Marry's own backstory, and events that happen long before that; also indicated by which timeline, or \"August 15th\" (among similar close dates) is referred to.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n==Characters==\n{{excessive detail|date=January 2019}}\n\n===Mekakushi Dan===\n;{{Nihongo|{{visible anchor|Kido}}|\u30ad\u30c9|Kido}} / {{Nihongo|{{visible anchor|Tsubomi Kido}}|\u6728\u6238 \u3064\u307c\u307f|Kido Tsubomi}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Y\u016bko Kaida]]}}\n:Kido is member No. 1 of the Mekakushi Dan and its current leader.

Because she was always treated cautiously by those around her, she harbored a strong desire to \"disappear\". One day, her father's business went bankrupt, driving him to set their house on fire. After being burned to death in the blaze, Kido came into contact with the Heat Haze along with her older half-sister Rin ({{voiced by|[[Yuki Kaida]]}}) and was possessed by the snake with the \"Concealing Eyes\" ability, thus acquiring the power to hide her presence, as well as the presence of anyone else within a two meter radius. She would then proceed to forget this event (of the Heat Haze) completely, until she has to remember it later on in the seventh novel, \"From the Darkness\" (partially told from her point of view, with her as the \"lead\" of the story). Becoming childhood friends with Seto and Kano in the same orphanage, she was later fostered<ref name=\"mekakushidan.com\">{{cite web|url=http://mekakushidan.com/actors/ayano|title=Mekakushi Dan Official Website|publisher=[[\u300cEDWORD RECORDS\u300d]]|date=September 29, 2018|accessdate=September 29, 2018}}</ref> temporarily by the Tateyama family, until events forced them out of the Tateyamas' home, including a \"route\" where they cut off all ties with Ayano. Initially encouraged by Ayano that having red eyes was the sign of a hero, she and the \"trio\" (her, Seto, and Kano) started the Mekakushi Dan. After Ayano's death, she was then given the role of \"leader\".\n\n:In the manga's alternate second timeline, Kido is the first to be killed after stumbling upon the Snake of Clearing Eyes. Kano then reflects on her death after she is found, and while later reconciling with Ayano, who did not get to reconcile with Kido in turn before Kido died. The manga also reveals the event of Kano first meeting Kido at the orphanage, told during the different alternative second timeline (also different from the novels version). Kido gives Kano her coat, as she noticed he was cold, Kano reacting with a surprised expression. The timeline would then go on to explain the two became fast childhood friends before meeting Seto later on, becoming a childhood friend of Seto's as well; the three being described officially, in relationship charts published in the official website as well as \"Kagerou Project Perfect Guide\" (2016),<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> as seeing each other as \"childhood friends\".<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n: Though Kido (in the novels) initially requests they do not use [[keigo]] (Japanese formalities), as it reminds her of her biological family, and because she dislikes such formalities now; Kano in the manga's alternate second timeline thought he ''was'' originally going to use [[keigo]] with her before she requested that. Initially dropping the formalities and beginning to call her by her first name alone, \"Tsubomi\", while with the Tateyamas and while during middle school two years before the main series begins (including while attending the school festival put on by Haruka and Takane), Kano would later come to address her by her last name (\"Kido\") after they leave the Tateyama household (an event which occurs in every \"route\" described in the \"Kagerou Project Perfect Guide\" (2016).),<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> the other two of the trio doing the same for him in every \"route\".\n\n:Though Kido was initially described (in Mekakucity Actors' script) with an \"official\" age of \"17\", and Kano and Seto \"16\", this would not be chronologically possible as the \"trio\" of Kido, Kano, and Seto are all in the same school grade, with varying birthdays (January 2, May 10, and March 3rd respectively). As a typical Japanese school year begins in April and ends in March (the series taking place in \"Kashiwa City\", Japan, later noted to also be in the Chiba prefecture) the ages conflicted with the official timelines, many taking place on August 14th-August 15th and later (in some cases) 17th. Sidu's published official artbook would later re-confirm Kido's age being \"16\", as Kano's is also officially changed correctly to \"17\", him (May 10) being older than Kido (January 2). Seto (birthday March 3rd) is the youngest of the trio, though still in the same grade as them.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n;{{Nihongo|{{visible anchor|Seto}}|\u30bb\u30c8|Seto}} / {{Nihongo|{{visible anchor|K\u014dsuke Seto}}|\u702c\u6238 \u5e78\u52a9|Seto K\u014dsuke}}\n:{{voiced by|[[S\u014dichir\u014d Hoshi]]}}, [[Sayori Ishizuka]] (young)\n:Seto is member No. 2 of the Mekakushi Dan.

He considered an abandoned dog (named \"Hanako\") to be his only friend, and wished that he could \"understand how people felt without using words\". One stormy day, he witnessed some kids trying to throw his dog friend into a river. Despite his efforts, the dog was thrown in, and Seto threw himself into the river in order to save it. As he drowned, he came into contact with the Heat Haze and was possessed by the snake with the \"Stealing Eyes\" ability, acquiring the ability to read others' minds upon eye contact. However, he generally dislikes using his eye ability as he feels that it is invasive and makes communication redundant, so he avoids using it unless it is absolutely necessary.

This change possibly references the music videos, as the entire course of the typical plot changes in the manga route's second timeline, when Marry hears loud text message notifications on Seto's phone instead of music playing, becoming frightened by the sound. The text message notifications are coming from a worried younger Kano, Kido, and Ayano, as Seto was already with the Tateyamas in this \"route\". (In both {{Nihongo|\"S\u014dz\u014d Foresuto\"|\u7a7a\u60f3\u30d5\u30a9\u30ec\u30b9\u30c8||\"Imagination Forest\"}} and {{Nihongo|\"K\u016bs\u014d Forest\"|\u7a7a\u60f3\u30d5\u30a9\u30ec\u30b9\u30c8||\"Fantasy Forest\"}}'s music videos, Ayano's connection to the trio hadn't been revealed yet, as it wouldn't be revealed until the later \"Ayano's Theory of Happiness\" music video.) The author, Jin, had also commented in 2012 in the official \"Kagerou Daze Disintegration Book\" that Ayano as a character was still being finalized around that time. (Both {{Nihongo|\"S\u014dz\u014d Foresuto\"|\u7a7a\u60f3\u30d5\u30a9\u30ec\u30b9\u30c8||\"Imagination Forest\"}} and {{Nihongo|\"K\u016bs\u014d Forest\"|\u7a7a\u60f3\u30d5\u30a9\u30ec\u30b9\u30c8||\"Fantasy Forest\"}}'s music videos, meanwhile, had debuted by May 18, 2012, when {{Nihongo|\"K\u016bs\u014d Forest\"|\u7a7a\u60f3\u30d5\u30a9\u30ec\u30b9\u30c8||\"Fantasy Forest\"}} debuted.)

Initially, including in earlier Talkers chapters, the Trio and the Tateyamas still appeared to function as a foster unit, such as when they talk about celebrating Kenjirou's birthday (Ayano, here seemingly alive, also appears at the household). However, later on in Talkers Chapter 29, a conversation occurs between Marry, Seto, Kano, and Shintar\u014d as they discuss \"siblings\". Marry claims she wants a \"brother\" (or, specifically, an \"''[[Japanese honorifics|onii-chan]]''\"-like figure), and targets the boys present in her \"search\" for an \"''onii-chan''\". Previously during the same chat, Shintar\u014d asks Kano if the Trio were \"kind of\" like siblings, to which Kano replies saying he doesn't believe he (Kano) has much \"''onii-chan'' power\" (\"big brother power\"), eventually implying Shintar\u014d has more of that than he does. Seto would later join in the conversation, agreeing with Kano as well (while also stating Shintar\u014d has the \"longest history as an ''Onii-chan''\"). The two frequently try to escape becoming Marry's \"''onii-chan''\", despite the earlier published alternative second manga storyline, and at one point Seto implies Marry calling him \"Seto-onii-chan\" feels weird (\"''Uh, that way of referring to me gives me a weird feeling...

As a typical Japanese school year begins in April and ends in March (the series taking place in \"Kashiwa City\", Japan, later noted to also be in the Chiba prefecture) the ages conflicted with the official timelines, many taking place on August 14th-August 15th and later (in some cases) 17th. Sidu's published official artbook would later re-confirm Kido's age being \"16\", as Kano's is also officially changed correctly to \"17\", him (May 10) being older than Kido (January 2).

He is depicted as a deceitful young man, to the point where no one can tell if he's lying or telling the truth.

His emotionally unstable mother raised her hand against him from time to time, and the neighbors spread rumors that he was being abused by her. In the novels \"route\", he believed that he was wrong for upsetting her, and desired strongly to \"hide the bruises/wounds on his body\" from those around him because they were the reason the neighbors disliked his mother. One day (in the novels \"route\"), his apartment was broken into by thieves. Kano's mother was stabbed and killed as she tried to protect him. He was stabbed to death as well when he tried to fight against the thieves, coming into contact with the Heat Haze. He was then possessed by the snake with the \"Deceiving Eyes\" ability, acquiring the power to alter how people around him perceive him and anything in immediate contact with him.\n\n:He was eventually brought to an orphanage and was later fostered<ref name=\"mekakushidan.com\">{{cite web|url=http://mekakushidan.com/actors/ayano|title=Mekakushi Dan Official Website|publisher=[[\u300cEDWORD RECORDS\u300d]]|date=September 29, 2018|accessdate=September 29, 2018}}</ref> temporarily by the Tateyama family, where he met Kido, Seto.

They created a team of \"heroes\" and Kano gave it its name, the Mekakushi Dan\u2014\"Mekakushi\" being a pun on Kido's eye ability. Unlike Seto, Kano uses his eye ability frequently, shifting outward emotions on a whim while never showing what he is truly feeling on the inside. He and Ayano were very close, as evidenced by the fact that (in the novels and anime \"routes\") she only shared her suspicions about Kenjir\u014d with him. As a result (in the novels \"route\") he often impersonated her and went to school in her stead, while she researched a way to stop the plans of Clearing Eyes. Ayano's death affects him greatly, and the added trauma of (in the novels \"route\") having to pretend to be Ayano's corpse during the funeral (as she did not leave behind a body) leaves him emotionally distressed. Though he uses his power to maintain a mask of lightheartedness and mischief, he develops a tendency to lash out at people close to him, sometimes by imitating people they care about, such as when he impersonated Haruka to upset Ene, or when impersonating Ayano to upset Shintar\u014d.\n\n:In the music video for {{Nihongo|\"Yobanashi Deceive\"|\u591c\u5484\u30c7\u30a3\u30bb\u30a4\u30d6||\"Night Tales Deceive\"}} in \"music\" route, Kano continuously walks the streets at night. He briefly is seen wearing hair clips while grinning, while images of a younger Seto and younger Kido are also seen behind him (Ayano is also noted to wear such hair clips; Seto being shown wearing them too in the video). Kano is later seen with a \"female\" form, shown more than once (including together) in both the official music video as well as published artbooks.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> He is always \"Deceiving\", initially believing himself to be something like a \"monster\". When a \"monster\" (implied to be Clearing Eyes in the novels) speaks to him one day, Kano begins to descend into always telling \"lies\", unable to tell his true self from his \"Deceiving\" self. He is frequently seen around and holding (including up to his face) masks, indicating his \"Deceiving\". At the end of the video, he bows to the viewer, as if it was a performance.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n:In the manga's alternate second timeline, his relationship with Ayano is more strained due to him being angry at her for suggesting to kill Marry. Kido's death greatly angers him to the point he wants to fight against her killer, the Snake Of Clearing Eyes.\n\n:In the official spinoff series \"Mekakucity Talkers\", the \"Trio\" of Kido, Kano and Seto appears to now live at the Mekakushi Dan's hideout while both Ayano and Kenjirou are still alive and living at the Tateyama's household (Ayaka Tateyama, however, does not initially appear, and timeline differences seemingly occur in Talkers as well).

She is 1/4 [[Medusa]] and has white hair that wiggles when she is happy or frightened and naturally occurring red eyes. Her appearance is that of a teenage girl, but due to her Medusa blood, her actual age is 140 years. Marry is extremely shy around strangers, and will often hide behind Seto, Kido, or Momo. Her songs are {{Nihongo|\"K\u016bs\u014d Forest\"|\u7a7a\u60f3\u30d5\u30a9\u30ec\u30b9\u30c8||\"Fantasy Forest\"}} and {{Nihongo|\"Marry no Kak\u016b Sekai\"|\u30de\u30ea\u30fc\u306e\u67b6\u7a7a\u4e16\u754c||\"Marry's Fictional World\"}}.\n\n:When Marry was younger, she lived in a small house in the woods with her mother, Shion, who was half Medusa. While growing up, she was constantly warned by her mother that should they make eye contact with others, the person would be turned to stone. One day, when she was playing outside against her mother's warnings, she was found and tortured by a group of boys. Shion successfully turned Marry's attackers to stone, but the two were both beaten to death and were brought into the Heat Haze by Azami, Shion's full Medusa mother (and Marry's grandmother). Upon entering it, Azami planted the snake with the \"Combining Eyes\" ability, the core of the Medusa, into Shion, who willingly gave it up to Marry so that she could have a second chance at life. As a result, along with the \"Eye Contact\" ability she had since birth, which allowed Marry to temporarily paralyze anyone she made eye contact with, Marry also acquired the ability to unify all of the \"snakes\".\n\n:After coming back to life, she lived in isolation for over a hundred years, greatly traumatized by her mother's death and terrified by the outside world. By chance, Seto visited the forest and befriended her, making her realize that the outside isn't so scary after all. He has since managed to bring her to the outside world and invited her to join the Mekakushi Dan.\n\n:After coming to the Mekakushi Dan's hideout and joining the group, she started a side job making fake flowers in her room, which generates a negligible income. She is said to be a ''fujoshi'', or a female who likes [[Yaoi|boy's love]].<ref name=\"Kagerou Daze Disintegration Book 2012\">Kagerou Daze Disintegration Book (2012)</ref> In Route XX among other \"bad end\" timelines, Clearing Eyes then kills all the members of the Mekakushi Dan besides Marry, and has her reset the timeline.

When Ayaka and Kenjir\u014d both died, Marry became completely guilt-ridden, believing that her being a \"monster\" caused the whole tragedy to happen. She also believes she herself is why the relationships between every member of the \"trio\" (including herself, and Ayano) had been \"changing\", stating this belief to Seto. Seto encourages her, explaining it's natural for human beings to \"change\", and implying it's not her fault. This event occurs after a scene in which Marry asks Kano, \"do you [[Love|like]] Kido?\", comparing Kano's feelings towards Kido and seeing them similar to those relationships seen in her fairy tale books (and claiming she read about it in a book). The specific word she uses in the Japanese edition is \"''suki''\", often used in romantic situations in Japan and between couples. Though Kano blushes and nervously denies such, Marry continued to press the question until Kano \"ran away\" to escape. The implication that the trio, Marry, and Ayano were all \"changing\" indicates that their former relationships had all thus \"changed\", in some cases drastically (such as their initially kicking Ayano out of the household) and in some cases not (such as Seto viewing Marry as a friend and human being, and the trio and Marry all viewing each other as \"friends\".).\n\n:It's also revealed in the same alternate second timeline of the manga that Marry's \"Queen\" (of the snakes) power here causes a great toll on her body as it slowly deteriorates her body to the point she can't move at all, possibly a result of her being more human than Medusa. Despite her cheerful personality, a monologue in the manga implies that while she loves her friends, she harbors a grudge against the world for taking everything from her, reflecting some of the attitudes her grandmother Azami and her mother Shion held towards humanity. She begins to absorb the powers of the snakes of her fallen comrades. The Mekakushi Dan members left, including her, would then attempt to face off against the snake of Clearing Eyes.\n\n:In the official spinoff series \"Mekakucity Talkers\", the \"Trio\" of Kido, Kano and Seto appears to now live at the Mekakushi Dan's hideout while both Ayano and Kenjirou are still alive and living at the Tateyama's household (Ayaka Tateyama, however, does not initially appear, and timeline differences seemingly occur in Talkers as well). Initially, including in earlier Talkers chapters, the Trio and the Tateyamas still appeared to function as a foster unit, such as when they talk about celebrating Kenjirou's birthday (Ayano, here seemingly alive, also appears at the household). However, later on in Talkers Chapter 29, a conversation occurs between Marry, Seto, Kano, and Shintar\u014d as they discuss \"siblings\". Marry claims she wants a \"brother\" (or, specifically, an \"''[[Japanese honorifics|onii-chan]]''\"-like figure), and targets the boys present in her \"search\" for an \"''onii-chan''\". Previously during the same chat, Shintar\u014d asks Kano if the Trio were \"kind of\" like siblings, to which Kano replies saying he doesn't believe he (Kano) has much \"''onii-chan'' power\" (\"big brother power\"), eventually implying Shintar\u014d has more of that than he does. Seto would later join in the conversation, agreeing with Kano as well (while also stating Shintar\u014d has the \"longest history as an ''Onii-chan''\"). The two frequently try to escape becoming Marry's \"''onii-chan''\", despite the earlier published alternative second manga storyline, and at one point Seto implies Marry calling him \"Seto-onii-chan\" feels weird (\"''Uh, that way of referring to me gives me a weird feeling... I wish you would drop it...''\") Eventually, the boys resolve the issue with Marry by them all agreeing they can be \"friends\" instead of siblings. Marry would later respond stating, \"I don't need an ''Onii-chan''. I [want to] go have fun with a friend.\"\n\n:Though she is referred to as a \"[[gorgon]]\" in the English localizations of the series, the Japanese translation, as well as Jin himself, have also referred to her instead being \"[[Medusa]]\". As well, her name is also frequently romanized as \"Mary\" and \"Marie\" in official Japanese materials, such as merchandise. All romanizations, including \"Marry\" (used in the English localization) are technically correct.\n\n:Marry's \"age\" Jin would later clarify himself on his official Twitter, stating: \"Since she didn't really count it, she herself didn't know her own age. So, on Marry's first birthday at the Mekakushi Dan's hideout, Kano told her that \"You'll be the same age as everyone then!!!\" while lighting 17 candles on the cake.\" \"The same age as everyone\" would refer to the \"Trio\" of Kano, Kido, and Seto all being around the same age (Kano 17, Kido and Seto 16 \"going-on\" 17). This exchange would imply Marry's \"age\" to be seen by her as being \"17\" as of July 21 (her official birthday). She also celebrates a birthday during the official spinoff series \"Mekakucity Talkers\", while already living at the Mekakushi Dan's hideout.\n\n;{{Nihongo|{{visible anchor|Momo}}|\u30e2\u30e2|Momo}} / {{Nihongo|{{visible anchor|Momo Kisaragi}}|\u5982\u6708 \u6843|Kisaragi Momo}}\n:{{voiced by|Nanami Kashiyama}}\n:Momo is member No. 5 of the Mekakushi Dan.

During a trip to the beach, she drowned in the ocean and was swallowed up by the Heat Haze, along with her father who had tried to save her and given the snake of \"Drawing Eyes\", which is capable of catching people's attention regardless of their preferences. At a fairly young age as a Junior High schooler, she gets a job as an idol, but she finds the constant attention and pressure miserable, lamenting that she just wants to be normal. It's here that she meets Kido, who explains the nature of their powers and offers to use teach Momo how to control her Drawing Eyes if she joins the Mekakushi Dan. Momo accepts, to Shintar\u014d's eventual chagrin.\n\n:In the manga's alternate timeline, she becomes the second victim of the Snake Of Clearing Eyes' killing spree, when she is thrown off a tall building by \"Hibiya Amamiya\" (as taken over by Clearing Eyes). Clearing Eyes (as \"Hibiya\") gets Momo to follow him when he asks for Momo's (referring to her as \"[[Japanese honorifics|onee-chan]]\") \"help\". (\"Please help me, ''onee-chan''.\") However, it's implied Momo knew something was wrong right away, as she reacts with a firm-looking expression and follows him; and likely recognizing he wasn't using \"oba-san\" or \"Aun\" (his \"ruder\" nicknames and \"honorific\") for her. This was incorrectly translated in the official English version of the manga; even though in the Japanese version and editions, the different honorifics are clearly displayed (including as [[kanji]]). Similar to this, in the novels, another instance occurs: Shintar\u014d recognizes right away Kano is posing as Momo when \"Momo\" (Kano) doesn't use the Japanese honorific \"''onii-chan''\" (lit. \"big brother\") for Shintar\u014d.

The [[Japanese Education|Japanese school year]] begins in April and ends in March; thus, she could only be 15 at the start of the school year with a birthday of February 14th.

Because of this, she was placed in a separate class at school with Haruka Kokonose, whom she harbored feelings for. As a human, Takane was ranked second in the country on a game called 'Dead Bullet -1989-' under the name of \"Senkou no Maihime\" (lit. Dancing Princess of the Spotlight)' and often stayed up late at night playing. This exacerbated her narcolepsy and made her irritable and bad-tempered at school. She died after being poisoned by Kenjir\u014d. Upon entering the Heat Haze, she is given the snake of \"Opening Eyes,\" giving her immortality through the ability to reside in digital objects. After becoming Ene, she was sent to Shintar\u014d's computer in an email from an unknown sender. Shintar\u014d refers to her as a 'virus' as she constantly plays pranks on him by deleting his files and threatening to upload his embarrassing poems on to the internet. Ene joins the Mekakushi Dan after helping to stop a terrorist attack at a local department store with Shintar\u014d.\n\n:In the manga's alternate timeline, she meets Haruka while both are hospitalized, and quickly bonds with him over video games. While she leaves, Haruka remains in the hospital, though she continues to talk to him. Upon seeing his fast friendship with Shintar\u014d, she stops talking to him out of jealousy. Later, she discovers that he had an attack and died and that shortly beforehand he had sketched her in his notebook. It is strongly implied that her regret caused her to commit suicide by jumping off the hospital building, at which point she entered the Heat Haze and became Ene.\n\n:Ene is not given an official age nor a birthday, her \"age\" being listed in Jin's 2012 \"Disintegration Book\" as being \"''???''\". However, Takane was in the same grade as Haruka, who were both a grade above Shintar\u014d and Ayano during high school (when Takane, Haruka, and Ayano were alive, 2 years before the main series begins). Despite rumors of such, Takane was also not given an official age nor birthday in any official canonical source.\n\n;{{Nihongo|{{visible anchor|Shintar\u014d}}|\u30b7\u30f3\u30bf\u30ed\u30fc|Shintar\u014d}} / {{Nihongo|{{visible anchor|Shintar\u014d Kisaragi}}|\u5982\u6708 \u4f38\u592a\u90ce|Kisaragi Shintar\u014d}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Takuma Terashima]]}} \n:Shintar\u014d is member No. 7 of Mekakushi Dan. He is the main protagonist of the story and has an IQ of 168. While he was in school, his intelligence caused him to have an apathetic personality. His songs are {{Nihongo|\"Lost Time Memory\"|\u30ed\u30b9\u30bf\u30a4\u30e0\u30e1\u30e2\u30ea\u30fc}} and {{Nihongo|\"T\u014dmei Answer\"|\u900f\u660e\u30a2\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc||\"Transparent Answer\"}}.\n\n:After a while, he became interested in the girl who sat next to him in class, Ayano Tateyama. Despite Ayano always acting cheerful and friendly towards him, Shintar\u014d would treat Ayano with something like coldness - though he is also shown to begin to regard Ayano at all, if not fully as a \"friend\". Ayano appears happy whenever Shintaro regards her. After Ayano's suicide, he falls into a deep depression and becomes a [[hikikomori]] addicted to the internet. A year after, he was \"sent\" a mysterious \"virus\" named Ene, and as he was unable to control her actions, his lifestyle was at a loss. After stopping a terrorist attack with Ene, he became involved with Mekakushi Dan. He would later come to possess the \"Retaining Eyes\", which allow him to remember all of the past (including all other previous routes and otherwise diverging timelines).\n\n:In the songs (\"Music Route\") Ayano's death results in two possible routes for the Mekakushi Dan, as shown in Lost Time Memory. In Route 1, also known as the Good End Route, Shintar\u014d (often portrayed in a red jersey) goes out and meets the Mekakushi Dan instead of staying at home and mourning Ayano. In Route XX, also known as the Bad End, Shintar\u014d (often portrayed in full black clothing), still mourning over Ayano's death at 18 years old, becomes fed up with Ene and kills her through unknown means, causing him to have a mental breakdown. The main Shintar\u014d dies while saving \"Kuroha\" (or, Clearing Eyes possessed Konoha) from shooting himself, while Route XX Shintar\u014d commits suicide by slitting his throat with a pair of red scissors. However, all of these events would supposedly lead to Shintar\u014d coming to possess \"Retaining Eyes\".\n\n:In the manga's alternate first and second timelines, Shintar\u014d is shown to have never met Ayano at all. However, after he dies in the first timeline, a \"vision\" (or \"dream\") of \"Ayano\" appears before him, asking him if Shintar\u014d knew why she died. After injuring himself in the new timeline he is hospitalized beside Haruka Kokonose, who serves the role of causing him to come out of his shell instead (and instead of Shintar\u014d meeting Haruka at school and becoming his, Ayano's, and Takane's classmate). When Haruka's illness causes him to have an attack and pass away, Shintar\u014d breaks down at the loss of his only friend and becomes a hikikomori like in the other timelines. It is later revealed Takane watched some of this happen from mostly afar (while going mostly unnoticed by Shintar\u014d and Haruka, when she tries to visit Haruka's hospital room to see Haruka). Takane would later seemingly commit suicide; becoming Ene, who again enters Shintar\u014d's life, and decides to help him come out of his shell herself this time. Shintar\u014d thus befriends Ene in a much different fashion from before, genuinely viewing her as a friend as time goes on. Together with Ene, Shintar\u014d and her would also play with the younger Junior High school aged Momo (Ene was even who seemed to pick out Momo's \"Aun\" hoodie). Shintar\u014d also watched over Momo from afar while she was in Junior High school, and as time went on, noticing her strange ability to attract attention even though he didn't understand it well at the time. In the manga's second timeline, he eventually would encounter Ayano again, this time as strangers; who requests his assistance.\n\n:Later on in the manga's alternate second timeline, he would officially join the Mekakushi Dan again. He does so by going to their new hideout, and encounters Ayano. Though Ayano initially tries to point out he doesn't have an eye power to protect himself while seeming [[Love|nervous]] by his presence; Shintar\u014d goes on to explain: he thought, if there was \"someone he could save\", he'll \"keep struggling\" to \"protect that person\", \"and that person can be no one else\" but Ayano herself. He declares he'll use all of his \"life force\" to \"fight\" for her, also declaring, \"I'm here to help you!\". Ayano responds by blushing terribly in her shock and surprise, and he is accepted into the Dan's hideout.\n\n:In the music video for the \"Music Route\" song \"Additional Memory\" (2018), it is revealed Ayano apparently loved Shintar\u014d since the very start all along, saying she didn't want to be \"just\" \"friends\". This revelation and seeming realization to herself occurs as she continuously falls from the buildings' rooftop, eventually waking up in the Heat Haze, appearing to herself as a classroom in monochrome colors while warped. Ayano sees the classroom from the sky as well, and seems to come to another realization; later encountering who appears to be Marry (in \"Queen\" form), while a physical snake (in snake form) appears above a then-leaning Ayano (as she leans in front of the also-kneeling Marry). Ayano would then go on to say (as she falls continuously, and seemingly not in person); \"I'm sorry\", \"''Sayonara''\", (lit. \"goodbye\" or \"farewell\"), and \"Daisuki da yo\" (lit: \"''I love you''\"), to who is indicated to be \"Shintar\u014d\" (seen as he looked previously in the beginning of the \"Lost Time Memory\" music video, where he walked with Ayano down the street to their school).\n\n;{{Nihongo|{{visible anchor|Hibiya}}|\u30d2\u30d3\u30e4|Hibiya}} / {{Nihongo|{{visible anchor|Hibiya Amamiya}}|\u96e8\u5bae \u97ff\u4e5f|Amamiya Hibiya}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Misuzu Togashi]]}}\n:Hibiya is member No. 8 of Mekakushi Dan. He is mentioned to be mature for his age and is shown to have an immense crush on Hiyori. In the novels and anime, he joins Mekakushi Dan after being spotted escaping the hospital he was at after an accident. His songs are {{Nihongo|\"Kagerou Daze\"|\u30ab\u30b2\u30ed\u30a6\u30c7\u30a4\u30ba||\"Heat Haze Daze\"}} and {{Nihongo|\"Otsukimi Recital\"|\u30aa\u30c4\u30ad\u30df\u30ea\u30b5\u30a4\u30bf\u30eb||\"Moon-viewing Recital\"}} (with Momo Kisaragi). Though it is not his song, he also appears in {{Nihongo|\"Konoha no Sekai Jij\u014d\"|\u30b3\u30ce\u30cf\u306e\u4e16\u754c\u4e8b\u60c5||\"Konoha's World Situation\"}}.\n\n:As a sixth-grade primary schooler, he is the youngest member of the group, at 12 years old (in \"Mekakucity Talkers\", he prepares to take Junior High exams, and later meets back up with Hiyori \"at school\" in what's initially implied to be a post-summer scenario.). He has the \"Eye Focusing\" ability, meaning he can see distant objects from an aerial view. He is originally from a village in the rural countryside and came with Hiyori Asahina to the city for the summer. He stayed at Hiyori's sister's house for the visit and met Konoha, who was living there at the time.\n\n:Hibiya sees Hiyori die in a traffic accident and somehow becomes stuck in a time loop trying to save her from dying, each time ending with him sacrificing himself to try and save Hiyori. He comes in contact with the Heat Haze and is given the snake of 'Focusing Eyes'.\n\n: In {{Nihongo|\"Konoha no Sekai Jij\u014d\"|\u30b3\u30ce\u30cf\u306e\u4e16\u754c\u4e8b\u60c5||\"Konoha's World Situation\"}}'s music video in \"music route\", Hibiya has seemingly \"switched\" the timeline, and is now the one dying repeatedly; while Hiyori is seen witnessing this, shocked and crying. Konoha tries to reach them both in time, but is unable to, as he is not visible physically at the time. Though they are different \"routes\", the novels appear to reference a similar event, as well - an upset Hibiya tells Konoha, \"''you were just standing there and watching!''\". The implication is that Hibiya actually ''could'' see Konoha during this point of time, at least, in the novels timeline. (The song contains the lines, from Konoha's point of view; \"With my wobbling see-through body; My hand won't reach them in time.\") In the 3rd novel, \"The Children Reason\", Shintar\u014d even references and repeats the line, when he discusses with Kido the possibility that Hibiya remembers the events of him being in the Heat Haze, both initially concluding that Hibiya ''did'' remember.\n\n:In the music, anime, and novels timeline, during \"Otsukimi Recital\", Hibiya is depressed because he hasn't been able to save Hiyori. Momo notices his depression, dragging him along to get him to partake in various \"fun\" events. In the music timeline, this involves things such as eating an extremely large meal (Hibiya only takes a bite), playing games at the arcade (where he slowly begins to seem to have fun), and trying on clothes and costumes (one of which involves Hibiya crossdressing while wearing a maid dress, as Momo gets him to do so.) The two later sit by the curb, where Hibiya's soda hits him in the eyes in a similar fashion to how Momo's own hit hers in \"Kisaragi Attention\". Momo continues to drag him along, and they reach a park. Hibiya begins to have flashbacks of Hiyori smiling, petting a cat, as Momo does the same thing, albeit getting scratched by one. As he begins crying again, Momo realizes the situation is desperate, and puts on a \"recital\" before him, encouraging him as her eyes turn red, drawing his attention. The full moon is visible behind them in the music video, relating to the song's title (\"Moon-viewing Recital\"), while in the anime, they are inside as she gives a performance on stage, again drawing his attention with her red eyes. At the end of the music video, he hesitantly reaches out for what seems to the viewer (and possibly him) as the back of Hiyori's dress; instead, he reaches Momo's hand. The two realize he's holding her hand, Momo getting an increasingly mischievous expression, while Hibiya becomes embarrassed and tries to look away. However, Momo grabs him by the hand and pulls him along happily, Hibiya now seemingly back to \"normal\". Shintar\u014d watches over them and his sister from afar with a grin (behind a tree), as does Kido, who is also there when Momo awakens after seemingly fainting from using her ability. In the novels, Momo and Hibiya head back. Hibiya proceeds to call Momo by only her name (\"Momo\"), instead of the rude nicknames he was using for her before (such as \"Aun\", similar to \"auntie\", implying she was middle aged, or \"old\"). Momo had previously requested he stop calling her those, and the fact Hibiya does so implies that their relationship became closer, by means of [[Japanese honorifics|yobisute]].\n\n:In the manga's second alternate timeline, Hibiya instead comes out of the Kagerou Daze with the Snake of Clearing Eyes, who proceeds to possess him and hunt down the Mekakushi Dan, after throwing Momo off a building. Clearing Eyes, using Hibiya's body, breaks through a window of the same building, falling far below. Clearing Eyes, still using Hibiya's body, then proceeds to speak to Konoha and the rest, telling them they can't change what is happening. Using Hibiya's body, Clearing Eyes moves towards the nearby street. While Hiyori runs to the scene from afar, Konoha chases after from a closer distance, reaching out with his hand in order to reach Hibiya - only to watch, yet again, as Clearing Eyes, possessing Hibiya, throws Hibiya's body into the street, right in front of the oncoming truck. As Hiyori approaches, watching in shock, Hibiya appears to finally regain his consciousness, before he tells Hiyori, \"I'm sorry\", eyes full of tears.\n\n:Though Hibiya and Konoha were both in front of the truck as it strikes, as Konoha was still reaching out for Hibiya; Clearing Eyes then uses the opportunity to jump to Konoha's body and leaves the scene. On the news Kano watches, three days passed since. Hibiya's corpse, as well as Momo's, were burned and thus unidentified. But since there were other wounds besides those caused by the \"accident\", there are chances the two were involved in some kind of case. Hibiya's status from then on is unknown.<ref>Kagerou Daze Manga</ref>\n\n:Because Hibiya's birthday is November 4th, and because it would take place before Ayano's birthday of November 22nd, he would be 13 during such a post-summer scenario, such as during the ending of Mekakucity Actors. In comparison, Hiyori's birthday, March 3rd, would place her on the \"younger\" end of her school year (the [[Education in Japan|Japanese school year]] begins in April and ends in late March.) This is also despite Hibiya and Hiyori's official ages not matching up with a real-world based timeline.\n\n;{{Nihongo|{{visible anchor|Konoha}}|\u30b3\u30ce\u30cf|Konoha}} / {{Nihongo|{{visible anchor|Haruka Kokonose}}|\u4e5d\u30ce\u702c \u9065|Kokonose Haruka}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Mamoru Miyano]]}}\n:Konoha is member No. 9 of Mekakushi Dan. Shown to be a rather absent-minded individual, he has a large appetite, similar to his human self as Haruka. His songs are {{Nihongo|\"Konoha no Sekai Jij\u014d\"|\u30b3\u30ce\u30cf\u306e\u4e16\u754c\u4e8b\u60c5||\"Konoha's World Situation\"}}, {{Nihongo|\"Y\u016bkei Yesterday\"|\u5915\u666f\u30a4\u30a8\u30b9\u30bf\u30c7\u30a4||\"Yesterday Evening\"}} (as Haruka), {{Nihongo|\"Outer Science\"|\u30a2\u30a6\u30bf\u30fc\u30b5\u30a4\u30a8\u30f3\u30b9}} (as Black Konoha), and {{Nihongo|\"Summertime Record\"|\u30b5\u30de\u30fc\u30bf\u30a4\u30e0\u30ec\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9}} (as both, or Haruka).\n\n:As a human, Haruka suffered from an illness which caused him to have \"attacks\" and collapse, making him have less time to live, hence making him wish for a body that would not be as vulnerable, and hence being placed in a separate class with Takane Enomoto. With the interference of Kenjir\u014d, he suffers an attack and dies, entering the Heat Haze with Takane, and therefore receiving the \"Awakening Eyes\" ability, which allows him to live in his ideal body. However, instead of being sent back like the others in the Heat Haze, Haruka stayed in the Heat Haze while the Snake of Awakening Eyes inhabits his body as Konoha, attempting to carry on Haruka's wishes of spending time with his friends. After this, the amnesiac Konoha stays at Ayaka's house, where he meets Hibiya and Hiyori and attempts to save them from the Heat Haze.\n\n:Though Konoha is born from such means, he is seen as being overall different from Haruka - Takane even noting such in the anime (and Ene thus calling Konoha \"imposter\") and is treated as being his own person. He is noted to have an \"[[Immortality|immortal]] body\".<ref name=\"Kagerou Daze Disintegration Book 2012\"/>\n\n:In \"Summertime Record\", the \"ending theme\" for the overall series, Konoha appears to \"join\" with Haruka's body, disappearing, and Haruka gaining Konoha's same mark on his cheek, as well as a slightly changed look. The specific events that lead to this occurrence were unknown. However, the various other endings show alternative fates for Konoha - in the anime, Konoha appears to disappear, Haruka regaining his physical body (only seen in the shadows, from afar), and Konoha's shadow briefly \"seen\" (to the viewer) running separately; in \"in a Day's\", the MX4D short movie, Konoha is instead seen leaving together with the rest of the Mekakushi Dan after they stop the terrorist incident all together (sans Ayano, and with both Hibiya and Hiyori, as well as Ene instead of Takane) only to be implied killed (with the rest) by the hidden bomb underneath the building at the end, Clearing Eyes seemingly never appearing; in the manga's first timeline, he is possessed by Clearing Eyes, and kills the then-formed Mekakushi Dan (sans Hibiya or Hiyori, who were instead unable to enter the mall due to an incident, and left outside of it; only to still have the timeline repeated) very early on; in the manga's second timeline, he is taken over by Clearing Eyes yet again after it leaves Hibiya's body, which Clearing Eyes possessed. In the \"Mekakucity Talkers\" spinoff, Konoha is again seen still \"alive\" along with the rest of the Mekakushi Dan (sans Hiyori, and with Hibiya, as well as Ayano and Ene). The implication that Hibiya is studying for Junior High school and later returns to school (\"after\" the summer would be over, while meeting up with Hiyori \"at school\") seems to imply Konoha (as Konoha, and possibly not Haruka) as well lives past \"an\" August 15th-18th in that timeline, if temporarily. However, Talkers would also later (in Chapter 31) bring up the location of the \"amusement park\" in passing.\n\n:An alternate version of Konoha appears in Outer Science, notably during the \"Music Route\", called Black Konoha (also dubbed as Kuroha by Japanese fans, {{Nihongo|''kuro''|\u9ed2}} meaning 'black'), and kills everyone in Route XX. In Route 1 (notably during \"Lost Time Memory\", in \"Music Route\") for unknown reasons, he attempts to shoot himself in the head, only to be saved by Shintar\u014d; \"Kuroha\"'s eyes widening in shock as he watches Shintar\u014d fall (it is unknown if the one shocked in \"Music Route\" was Konoha, or Clearing Eyes himself). In the anime, \"Kuroha\" is revealed to be the snake of 'Clearing Eyes', Kenjir\u014d's eye ability, which has transferred itself to Konoha (termed \"forming\" in him) and possessed him, believing him to be a stronger vessel.\n\n;{{Nihongo|{{visible anchor|Ayano}}|\u30a2\u30e4\u30ce|Ayano}} / {{Nihongo|{{visible anchor|Ayano Tateyama}}|\u696f\u5c71 \u6587\u4e43|Tateyama Ayano}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Mai Nakahara]]}}\n:Ayano is member No. 0 of the Mekakushi Dan and was the daughter of Kenjir\u014d and Ayaka Tateyama.

After the death of her mother in a landslide and the discovery that her father was experimenting on her friends in an attempt to bring her back to life, Ayano grew increasingly concerned of the safety of the \"trio\". She committed suicide by jumping off the roof of her school in an attempt to save her family and friends from the plot of the snake that gives Kenjir\u014d the 'Clearing Eyes.' She gets possessed by a snake and obtains the 'Favoring Eyes,' which allows her to project her thoughts and emotions unto others.\n\n:In the manga's alternate first timeline, she is there with Marry when the landslide happens, now killing both her parents. She receives Favoring Eyes as a result, as well as the memories of Azami. Becoming far more stoic and cynical, she comes to the conclusion that to save the trio from harm, she must kill Marry, the catalyst of the tragedies to come. Kido punches Ayano hard enough to draw blood (reflecting a similar incident from their past when they were younger, and Kido was still new to the household) but Ayano doesn't change her mind. Extremely angered, shocked, and fearing for Marry's well-being and life, the trio then kick Ayano completely out of the house, cutting all ties with Ayano. In turn, she never meets Shintar\u014d or her other school friends, but also doesn't remain trapped in the Daze. Unfortunately, her relationships with all of the trio worsened to an extreme as a result as well. When meeting her again, Kano addresses her extremely coldly as \"''o''nee-chan\" (formal [[Japanese honorifics|Japanese honorific]], meaning similar to \"big sister\") instead of \"''n''ee-chan\" (informal [[Japanese honorifics|Japanese honorific]], meaning similar to \"sister\"), something he had never done before that. As the manga's storyline continued, many further events would eventually lead to Kano reconciling with Ayano, reinstating her \"''n''ee-chan\", however, she would be unable to reconcile in person with the already dead Kido, and Seto who was busy at the time taking care of Marry.\n\n:In the fifth novel \"The Deceiving\", alternative events would again occur from other timelines, in which a young Kano meets young Ayano at the park one day, a short time before he initially dies being killed during a robbery (and before they would have met at her household), and thus meeting as strangers at the park. Ayano swung from the metal bar at the park, only to then have a brief conversation with Kano, in which he didn't reveal his name to her (and she didn't get to reveal hers to him). Kano would then come to mentally describe Ayano as \"Park Girl\", remembering her to the point of being able to take on her form, including while at the orphanage, before they meet the Tateyamas and Ayano again later on, and again are fostered<ref name=\"mekakushidan.com\">{{cite web|url=http://mekakushidan.com/actors/ayano|title=Mekakushi Dan Official Website|publisher=[[\u300cEDWORD RECORDS\u300d]]|date=September 29, 2018|accessdate=September 29, 2018}}</ref> temporarily at the household. This event does not seemingly occur in any other timeline but the novels.\n\n:An Ayano that Shintar\u014d meets at some times (in the real world) is revealed to also be Kano (including in the novels) using his \"Deceiving\" ability, who does so to spite Shintar\u014d, whom he believes caused Ayano's death. However, Kano would later apologize for the incidents in the seventh novel (\"From the Darkness\") and Shintar\u014d forgives him, genuinely befriending Kano. Kano would go on to believe (thinking to himself) he was no match for Shintar\u014d. Kano also notes to himself Shintar\u014d would \"show a different kind of smile\" to \"Ayano only\"; then thinking Shintar\u014d showed \"that kind of smile\" to Kano himself as well, showing they fully reconcile.\n\n:An Ayano that Shintar\u014d meets in the Heat Haze at other times is revealed to be his own snake, taking on her form wearing her black school uniform, but without her red scarf.\n\n:In the short novel \"My Little Daze\", an encounter and first meeting with Shintar\u014d at Junior High school 2 years before the main series begins is told through her point of view (as his point of view is told in the drama CD track for the same event). There, she meets Shintar\u014d for the first time in Junior High school. She initially mistakes Shintar\u014d for a girl because of his surname (\"Kisaragi\") sounding feminine, being slightly shocked when she learns he is a boy. This information is revealed to her through a female teacher at the school, who Ayano speaks with after the teacher notices Ayano in a daze during a ceremony (Ayano herself describing it as a \"daze\", while she had been imagining what it'd be like to be a \"hero\", as her father talked of). When the teacher glares at Ayano, Ayano describes it as similar to a \"frog that was being glared at by a snake\". The teacher lets Ayano go, revealing Shintar\u014d was male, and Ayano would then meet Shintar\u014d in person. Though Shintar\u014d treats her same as he always does at the start, in the drama CD track and short novel, he appears to also be regarding Ayano while doing so. Ayano later asks Shintar\u014d to tutor her, and Shintar\u014d agrees \"just for today\" after an initial pause. Ayano was \"so happy\" she \"felt like jumping up and down, but figured that was probably a bad idea, and stopped\" herself. She asks if they would \"finally\" \"be able to become friends\", asks if her \"pounding chest\" was going to be \"able\" to \"stand this\", then concludes, \"no\", she was \"going to be fine\". Her father once told her \"A pounding chest is the proof of justice\", so she was \"definitely going to be fine\". The entire story from both forms of media appears to reflect the beginning of \"Transparent Answer\"'s music video in the \"Music Route\", albeit told in a different way, and with different events and perhaps results. As Ayano also does not mention the \"trio\" of Kido, Kano, and Seto at all during this entire monologue, it is unknown if they would take the trio into her household in this series of events. Before the series was adapted into other published media such as the manga, novels and anime, Ayano was also never described in connection with the trio until the \"Ayano's Theory of Happiness\" music video debuted, revealing a connection there, before the anime. She was instead described initially as \"taking care of her father and friend\", implied to be Kenjir\u014d and Shintar\u014d respectively, during a timeline where only her mother died.<ref name=\"Mekakushi Dan Official Website\"/><ref name=\"Kagerou Daze Disintegration Book 2012\"/><ref>Daze/Days cd \"My Little Daze\" Short Story</ref>\n\n:In Route 1, after Shintar\u014d (in red jersey) meets the real Ayano in the Heat Haze, she passes her eye ability to him.\n\n:In the music video for the \"Music Route\" song \"Additional Memory\", it is revealed she apparently loved Shintar\u014d since the very start all along, saying she didn't want to be \"just\" \"friends\". This revelation and seeming realization to herself occurs as she continuously falls from the buildings' rooftop, eventually waking up in the Daze, appearing to her as a warped classroom in monochrome colors and covered in flowers. Ayano sees the classroom from the sky as well, and seems to come to another realization; later encountering who appears to be Marry (in \"Queen\" form), while a physical snake (in snake form) appears above a then-leaning Ayano (as she leans in front of the also-kneeling Marry). Ayano would then go on to say (as she falls continuously, and seemingly not in person); \"I'm sorry\", \"''Sayonara''\", (lit. \"goodbye\" or \"farewell\"), and \"Daisuki da yo\" (lit: \"''I love you''\"), to who is indicated to be \"Shintar\u014d\" (seen as he looked previously in the beginning of the \"Lost Time Memory\" music video, where he walked with Ayano down the street to their school).\n\n:She is stated to have initially died during her first year of [[Education in Japan|high school]], when she would still be about 15 years old (as the event of her death happens on August 15th, while her birthday isn't until November 22nd); however, she was also in the same class as Shintar\u014d, being his classmate, thus making them close in age. Since Shintar\u014d (with an April 30th birthday) is already 18 during the main series, Ayano would be 18 post-series (by November 22nd) when \"alive\" as well. (In the official spinoff series \"Mekakucity Talkers\", [[autumn]] is also implied approaching, in Chapter 31. The format of the real-world [[Education in Japan|Japanese school year]], which begins April 1st and ends in late March, also implies Ayano's age range.)\n\n===Other characters===\n;{{Nihongo|{{visible anchor|Kenjir\u014d}}|\u30b1\u30f3\u30b8\u30ed\u30a6|Kenjir\u014d}} / {{Nihongo|{{visible anchor|Kenjir\u014d Tateyama}}|\u696f\u5c71\u3000\u7814\u6b21\u6717|Tateyama Kenjir\u014d}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Keiji Fujiwara]]}}\n:Kenjir\u014d is the father of Ayano and husband of Ayaka.

When he was in university, he fell in love with Ayaka, who turned him down, not interested in such a pathetic man. This caused him to become much more hard working and taking studying more seriously. After that, he was able to marry Ayaka. Together they had Ayano and temporarily fostered<ref name=\"mekakushidan.com\">{{cite web|url=http://mekakushidan.com/actors/ayano|title=Mekakushi Dan Official Website|publisher=[[\u300cEDWORD RECORDS\u300d]]|date=September 29, 2018|accessdate=September 29, 2018}}</ref> Kido, Kano and Seto. Kenjir\u014d was interested in the theory of Medusae and researched it with Ayaka, only to be caught in a landslide with her and die. He came in contact with the Heat Haze and was possessed by the snake of 'Clearing Eyes'. He became much more engrossed in research after Ayaka's death, eventually experimenting on and killing his two students (Takane and Haruka), this was done while possessed by the snake of 'Clearing Eyes'. His fate is that he dies and reunites with Ayaka in the Heat Haze; in Route XX, the snake of 'Clearing Eyes' (while it is possessing Konoha) kills him.\n\n;{{Nihongo|{{visible anchor|Hiyori}}|\u30d2\u30e8\u30ea|Hiyori}} / {{Nihongo|{{visible anchor|Hiyori Asahina}}|\u671d\u6bd4\u5948 \u65e5\u548c|Asahina Hiyori}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Kotori Koiwai]]}}\n:Hiyori is a stubborn young girl from the countryside who yearns for the city. She is very popular at her school and has her own fan club. She drags Hibiya to the city with her in order to get Momo's autograph and stays at her sister's, Ayaka, house. She falls in love with Konoha who was staying there at the time. She becomes involved in a traffic accident and gets stuck in a time loop trying to save Hibiya, but while Hibiya successfully escapes the Heat Haze, she passes away. Despite her apparent pessimistic personality and constant insults she uses towards Hibiya, she truly cares about him. She seemingly thinks of him as an important person; since she never saw her distant older sister before her sister's death; and, because of her popularity that makes it harder for her to be friends with others. She appears in {{Nihongo|\"Kagerou Daze\"|\u30ab\u30b2\u30ed\u30a6\u30c7\u30a4\u30ba||\"Heat Haze Daze\"}} together with Hibiya, who mostly tells the song through his point of view, changing to Hiyori's only in the final verse. She also appears in {{Nihongo|\"Konoha no Sekai Jij\u014d\"|\u30b3\u30ce\u30cf\u306e\u4e16\u754c\u4e8b\u60c5||\"Konoha's World Situation\"}}, now witnessing Hibiya dying, while shocked and crying. Konoha tries to reach them both in time, but is unable to, as he is not visible physically at the time.\n\n:In the manga's alternative second timeline, she became one of the protagonists. After entering the Heat Haze by what seems to be an \"accident\", she seemingly gained the 'Focusing Eyes' in Hibiya's stead as he was the one who received the 'Clearing Eyes' instead. Hiyori eventually helps the Mekakushi Dan after the aftermath of the 'Clearing Eyes' incident.\n\n:In the final novel for the novels' timeline (\"Summer Time Reload\"), Hiyori eventually became an official member of the Mekakushi Dan sometime after the aftermath of witnessing Hibiya dying repeatedly in previous timelines. She is \"invited\", or \"forced\", by Ene, who she describes as the \"noisy blue girl\", to become the now officially \"10th\" member.\n\n:Because Hibiya's birthday is November 4th, and because it would take place before Ayano's birthday of November 22nd, he would be 13 during such a post-summer scenario, such as during the ending of Mekakucity Actors. In comparison, Hiyori's birthday, March 3rd, would place her on the \"younger\" end of her school year (the [[Education in Japan|Japanese school year]] begins in April and ends in late March.) This is also despite Hibiya and Hiyori's official ages not matching up with a real-world based timeline.\n\n;{{Nihongo|{{visible anchor|Shion}}|\u30b7\u30aa\u30f3|Shion}} / {{Nihongo|{{visible anchor|Shion Kozakura}}|\u5c0f\u685c \u7d2b\u82d1|Kozakura Shion}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Akemi Okamura]]}}\n:Shion is a 1/2 medusa and Marry's mother. When Shion was younger, she lived with her parents Azami and Tsukihiko. She loves Marry very much, and in order to protect her she refrains from letting Marry play outside. One day, Marry bypasses her mother's orders and plays outside anyways, however some boys come to attack her. She sacrifices herself in order to save Marry, and uses her eye power to turn the boys to stone; but the strain on her body was too much and she passes away with Marry.\n\n:She gets consumed by the Heat Haze and is given the 'Combining Eyes' ability, however she passes the power on to Marry and sends her to the outside world.

Snakes grow from her hair, each with a unique power. She once thought humans were 'dull creatures that die easily' but fell in love with a human named Tsukihiko and started a family. After realizing how short human lives were compared to her immortality, she goes away to use the power of the snakes to create a Never Ending World (The Heat Haze) where she could live with her family forever. It is currently unclear if she waited for her family to arrive in the Heat Haze, before realising that her husband would have died by then, or that when she returned, the villagers attacking her house made her revert to her original ideology, causing her to return to the Never-Ending World alone.\n:Many years later, her daughter and granddaughter, Shion and Marry were killed on August 15. Knowing this, she was unable to bear her grief and ordered the Heat Haze to \"bring in every person who died on August 15\", giving the ability of 'Combining Eyes' to Shion to allow her to return to life (who gave it to Marry). This causes her to lose control of the Heat Haze, thus drawing in every person who had died on August 15, the day Marry died, it is presumed that she died due to her power completely taken over by him and eventually suffocating to her death. Her body is later used by the Snake of The Clearing Eyes so that he might able to use her power to find a perfect vessel for him which is Konoha, In the end, she finally able to peacefully die with Shion by her side, finally freed from the torture she has been suffering for very many years.

Tsukihiko is a white haired, light-eyed man, and has long been considered a \"monster\" by the other villagers, due to his appearance. He tells Azami that he is also a \"monster\", and that they should spend their life together. Together, they had Shion and live peacefully until villagers attacked their home, mistakenly thinking he had been held captive.

It is the true antagonist of the series. :Its songs are {{Nihongo|\"Outer Science\"|\u30a2\u30a6\u30bf\u30fc\u30b5\u30a4\u30a8\u30f3\u30b9||}} (as himself) and {{Nihongo|\"Dead and Seek\"|\u30c7\u30c3\u30c9\u30a2\u30f3\u30c9\u30b7\u30fc\u30af||}} (''while formed in Kenjir\u014d'').\n\n:In many timelines, it took control of Kenjir\u014d's body and survived under his wish of reuniting with his wife, going to extremes by doing so. Its true goal, however, is living forever. Also in many timelines, it transfers itself to Konoha's body and possesses it, causing Konoha's appearance to change into a \"darker\" look as well (wearing a full black version of Konoha's clothing, and with black hair).<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n:However, in the manga's alternate second timeline, he initially possesses Hibiya Amamiya instead, only body-jumping to Konoha later on (after killing Hibiya, by throwing Hibiya while Clearing Eyes is still using his body into the path of an incoming truck). Konoha was trying to reach Hibiya in time, but is unable to. Though both Hibiya and Konoha are seen in \"front\" of the truck just before it strikes, Clearing Eyes would then body-jump to Konoha, as the truck kills Hibiya, surrounding them with fire.\n\n:In many timelines, it then kills all the members of the Mekakushi Dan besides Marry, and has her reset the timeline. This happens by means of her Combining Eyes ability, used through her by the snake of 'Clearing Eyes', who \"awakens\" her<ref name=\"Kagerou Daze Disintegration Book 2012\"/>(often in \"Queen\" form), and, by \"collecting\" the snakes that \"have lost their owners\",<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> she reverses time in order to save everyone. Marry seemingly reverses time at the end of every official \"route\" and \"timeline\" seen thus far.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n:However, in the manga's alternate second timeline, Clearing Eyes takes on a new \"look\" for the first time, discarding Konoha's previous form while still seemingly in use of Konoha's body. On his body, notably his arms and legs, his skin takes on hues of pure black (also coming from the shadows surrounding him) while fading into a dark red [[color gradient]], his eyes being the same glowing dark red. Snake-like skin covers the top half of his face and cheeks, leaving the area around his mouth a light grey. His spiky hair hangs downwards, a large and long piece of which falling between his eyes, while two other equally long strands also frame his face.\n\n:It's also revealed in the same alternate second timeline of the manga that Marry's \"Queen\" (of the snakes) power here causes a great toll on her body as it slowly deteriorates her body to the point she can't move at all, possibly a result of her being more human than gorgon. Despite her cheerful personality, a monologue in the manga implies that while she loves her friends, she harbors a grudge against the world for taking everything from her, reflecting some of the attitudes her grandmother Azami and her mother Shion held towards humanity. She begins to absorb the powers of the snakes of her fallen comrades. The Mekakushi Dan members left, including her, would then attempt to face off against the snake of Clearing Eyes.\n\n:In the anime's timeline, it is seemingly \"defeated\" when Kenjir\u014d's wish is granted and it has to comply to Konoha's wish, which was bringing Hiyori back life, so it becomes her surrogate life. It is eventually revealed that he was powered by the souls that were trapped in the haze. The Heat Haze was in fact not only created by Azami, but powered by the \"wishes\" of people who died on August 14th-15. Anybody who died on those days can't move into the afterlife at all, until someone with gorgon blood (Marry) who can use the Combining Eyes repeats the current timeline. Repeating the timeline in turn (seemingly) stops the haze and frees all of the dead souls that are trapped inside. This appears to permanently weaken the Snake of Clearing Eyes.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n:However, the \"Kagerou Project Perfect Guide\" (2016) would then reveal most \"routes\", or timelines, are repeated after all; including seemingly the initial anime's.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> The MX4D short film's \"route\" seemingly does not contain Clearing Eyes at all, though it contains very different events from the initial anime's timeline, as the near-full Mekakushi Dan (sans Ayano, and with Ene, Konoha, Hibiya, and Hiyori all together) appear to stop the mall \"incident\"'s terrorist attack on their own and together, defeating other \"new\" characters who appear as the terrorists. However, at the end of the MX4D, a bomb is seen at the end, ticking down to zero, and indicating the timeline reset. It is unknown if Clearing Eyes exists in this timeline due to him not appearing physically or being referred to; however, the similar initial events (specifically, the start of the mall incident) may indicate he does. In the novels, it was also revealed he controlled nearly all of the city, including officials.\n\n:In a short manga \"Marry no Kak\u016b Sekai\" (\u30de\u30ea\u30fc\u306e\u67b6\u7a7a\u4e16\u754c, \"Marry's Fictional World\"), published near the start of the manga's alternate second timeline, Clearing Eyes faces Marry, who proceeds to use her power to turn him into stone. As she does so, Clearing Eyes, as \"Black Konoha\", with a bloodied scratch on his cheek and eyes widened in shock, surprise, and possibly even hurt, begins to become stone. However, Marry was later awoken at the Mekakushi Dan hideout by a worried Momo (the trio also being present). Marry would smile through her tears, realizing it was a \"dream\". This short manga having the same title as the song of the same name, where Marry sings and indicating herself repeating timelines so she can continue to remain with her friends, indicates it may not have completely been a \"dream\". \"Marry no Kak\u016b Sekai\" (\u30de\u30ea\u30fc\u306e\u67b6\u7a7a\u4e16\u754c, \"Marry's Fictional World\") is also included by title at the end of routes similar to \"Route XX\", especially notable at the very end of the initial music \"route\", where it is placed after the events of \"Konoha no Sekai Jij\u014d\" (\u30b3\u30ce\u30cf\u306e\u4e16\u754c\u4e8b\u60c5, \"Konoha's World Situation\") and \"Kagerou Daze\" (\u30ab\u30b2\u30ed\u30a6\u30c7\u30a4\u30ba, \"Heat Haze Daze\") (which occur at the same time as each other), leading into \"Outer Science\" (\u30a2\u30a6\u30bf\u30fc\u30b5\u30a4\u30a8\u30f3\u30b9) and concluding with \"Marry no Kak\u016b Sekai\" (\u30de\u30ea\u30fc\u306e\u67b6\u7a7a\u4e16\u754c, \"Marry's Fictional World\") along with a repeat.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n== Media ==\n===CD / DVDs===\nThe series began as a series of albums that were released alongside the novels.

Tezuka also states that as players continue to upload levels, he and the development staff will use these creations as a reference for adding content after launch, viewing the dynamic as a give-and-take between developers and consumers.{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\n''Super Mario Maker 2'' was revealed during a [[Nintendo Direct]] presentation on February 13, 2019.

Tezuka also states that as players continue to upload levels, he and the development staff will use these creations as a reference for adding content after launch, viewing the dynamic as a give-and-take between developers and consumers.{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\n''Super Mario Maker 2'' was revealed during a [[Nintendo Direct]] presentation on February 13, 2019.

Brill, the Uptime Institute was founded as an industry proponent to help owners and operators quantify and qualify their ability to provide a predictable level of performance from data centers, regardless of the status of external factors, such as power utilities. In 2009, the Uptime Institute was acquired by ''The 451 Group'' .<ref>[http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=22408554 Company Overview of The 451 Group LLC] at ''investing.businessweek.com''</ref>\n\nSince then, the Seattle-based Uptime Institute has been an independent division of ''The 451 Group''.<ref>[https://www.451research.com/our-company The 451 Group - Our Company] at 451research.com</ref>\n\n===Uptime Institute tier certifications===\nThe Uptime Institute's [[Data center#Data center tiers|data center tier concepts]] have grown from a simple publication in the late 1990s of the ''Tier Classifications Define Site Infrastructure Performance'' white paper<ref>[https://uptimeinstitute.com/resources/asset/tier-standard-topology/ Tier Classifications Define Site Infrastructure Performance]</ref> to a globally recognized standard guiding design and investment for data centers globally. The data center Tier standards are a standardized methodology used to determine availability in a facility. It offers companies a way to measure [[return on investment]] (ROI) and define desired levels of delivered performance. As of 2017, more than 1000 data centers worldwide have formally certified their data centers using the Tier standard.\n\nThere are two parts of the Tier certification process:\n\n*Tier Certification of Design Documents - typically the first step in the Tier process and used to align the design and construction of a new facility with an organization's business needs.\n*Tier Certification of Constructed Facility - the final part of the process which assures that the actual constructed data centers delivers the results specified in the Tier Standard: Topology specification.\n\nThe Tier certifications are awarded in four levels:\n\n*Tier IV - Fault tolerant site infrastructure\n*Tier III - Concurrently maintainable site infrastructure\n*Tier II - Redundant capacity components site infrastructure (redundant)\n*Tier I - Basic site infrastructure (non-redundant)\nThe full Tier Standard:Topology is available on the Uptime Institute website<ref>https://uptimeinstitute.com/resources/asset/tier-standard-topology</ref>\n\nOther design standards have been created by various industry groups over the years. All of these other specifications share the common trait that they are self-certified and the author of the specification does not get involved with the certification/assurance of standard compliance.  One such standard is [[Telecommunications Industry Association|Telecommunications Industry Association's]] standard, [[TIA-942]].<ref>[http://global.ihs.com/doc_detail.cfm?currency_code=USD&customer_id=2125442B2B0A&oshid=2125442B2C0A&shopping_cart_id=292558332D4B50304F5A3D3F2C0A&country_code=US&lang_code=ENGL&item_s_key=00414811&item_key_date=940819&input_doc_number=TIA-942&input_doc_title= TIA-942 TIA-942 Telecommunications Infrastructure Standard for Data Centers] at ''ihs.com''</ref> Uptime Institute and TIA agree on clear separation between their respective bench-marking systems to avoid industry confusion and drive accountability.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://uptimeinstitute.com/component/content/article/8-certifications/203-tiersvstia2014 |title=Archived copy |access-date=October 28, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140822054817/http://uptimeinstitute.com/component/content/article/8-certifications/203-tiersvstia2014 |archive-date=August 22, 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[High availability]]\n* [[Downtime]]\n* [[Uptime]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Business services companies established in 1993]]\n[[Category:Information technology companies of the United States]]\n[[Category:International information technology consulting firms]]\n[[Category:Research and analysis firms]]\n[[Category:Reliability engineering]]\n", "text_old": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{lead rewrite|date=February 2019}}\n{{primary sources|date=February 2019}}\n}}\n\n{{Use mdy dates|date=November 2018}}\n{{Infobox company\n| name = 451 Research\n| logo = 451 Research Logo.svg\n| logo_padding = \n| type = Privately held company\n| hq_location_city = [[New York City]]\n| products = {{unbulleted list|Market Insight|Cloud Price Index|Market Monitor|Voice of the Enterprise}}\n| services = {{unbulleted list|Research|Consultancy|Events}}\n| parent = The 451 Group\n| website = {{url|http://www.451research.com}}\n}}\n\n'''451 Group''' has two operating components:\n* 451 Research\n* Uptime Institute\n\n==451 history==\n451 Research was founded in 2000<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/451-research|title=Crunchbase - 451 Research}}</ref>\n\n451 Research's parent company, The 451 Group, subsequently acquired:\n* Tier 1 research in 2005,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20050804005140/en/451-Group-Acquires-Tier-1-Research-Tier|title=451 Group Acquires Tier 1 Research}}</ref> \n* events company Tech Touchstone in 2013,<ref>{{cite web\n|url=https://www.citmagazine.com/article/1170746/tech-touchstone-acquired-us-based-group|title=Tech Touchstone acquired by US-based group}}</ref> \n* [[Uptime Institute]] in 2009,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.datacenterknowledge.com/archives/2009/10/23/the-uptime-institute-sold-to-451-group|title=The Uptime Institute Sold to 451 Group}}</ref> \n* consumer spending research firm Changewave in 2011,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20110324006534/en/Leading-Technology-Industry-Analyst-Company-451-Group-Acquires|title=Leading Technology-Industry Analyst Company The 451 Group Acquires ChangeWave Research}}</ref> \n* mobile communications research firm [[Yankee Group]] in 2013<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-yankeegroup-451/451-group-buys-yankee-group-from-alta-communications-idUSBRE9020H220130103|title=451 Group buys Yankee Group from Alta Communications}}</ref>\n* and IT professional community Wisegate in 2017.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.prweb.com/releases/2017/wisegate_451research/prweb14550559.htm|title=ISSA Selects Wisegate, a 451 Research Community, as Peer Networking Platform for CISO's}}</ref>\n\nOver a period of time, parent company 451 Group acquired a number of other companies.

Brill, the Uptime Institute was founded as an industry proponent to help owners and operators quantify and qualify their ability to provide a predictable level of performance from data centers, regardless of the status of external factors, such as power utilities. In 2009, the Uptime Institute was acquired by ''The 451 Group'' .<ref>[http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=22408554 Company Overview of The 451 Group LLC] at ''investing.businessweek.com''</ref>\n\nSince then, the Seattle-based Uptime Institute has been an independent division of ''The 451 Group''.<ref>[https://www.451research.com/our-company The 451 Group - Our Company] at 451research.com</ref>\n\n===Uptime Institute tier certifications===\nThe Uptime Institute's [[Data center#Data center tiers|data center tier concepts]] have grown from a simple publication in the late 1990s of the ''Tier Classifications Define Site Infrastructure Performance'' white paper <ref>[https://uptimeinstitute.com/resources/asset/tier-standard-topology/ Tier Classifications Define Site Infrastructure Performance]</ref> to a globally recognized standard guiding design and investment for data centers globally. The data center Tier standards are a standardized methodology used to determine availability in a facility. It offers companies a way to measure [[return on investment]] (ROI) and define desired levels of delivered performance. As of 2017, more than 1000 data centers worldwide have formally certified their data centers using the Tier standard.\n\nThere are two parts of the Tier certification process:\n\n*Tier Certification of Design Documents - typically the first step in the Tier process and used to align the design and construction of a new facility with an organization's business needs.\n*Tier Certification of Constructed Facility - the final part of the process which assures that the actual constructed data centers delivers the results specified in the Tier Standard: Topology specification.\n\nThe Tier certifications are awarded in four levels:\n\n*Tier IV - Fault tolerant site infrastructure\n*Tier III - Concurrently maintainable site infrastructure\n*Tier II - Redundant capacity components site infrastructure (redundant)\n*Tier I - Basic site infrastructure (non-redundant)\nThe full Tier Standard:Topology is available on the Uptime Institute website<ref>https://uptimeinstitute.com/resources/asset/tier-standard-topology</ref>\n\nOther design standards have been created by various industry groups over the years.

The song was produced by  [[Larry Smith (producer)|Larry Smith]] and [[Russell Simmons]] and released by [[Profile Records]] in March 1984. Following the popularity of their previous two singles \"[[Hard Times (Run-D.M.C. song)|Hard Times]]\" (1983) and \"[[It's Like That (Run\u2013D.M.C. song)|It's Like That]]\" (1983), Profile Records head suggested to the producers and group that they should attempt to record an album as they already had four songs ready, and releasing a few more would not hurt them. Despite speculating low sales from the label and the group not feeling that hip hop was a genre appropriate for a full-length album, they were given an advance to start recording. This led to Run-DMC members [[Joseph Simmons|Joseph \"Run\" Simmons]] and [[Darryl McDaniels|Darryl \"DMC\" McDaniels]] going through their rhyme book to develop new songs, one of which would become \"Rock Box\". \n\nAfter having to wait for the heavy metal band [[Riot V|Riot]] to finish their studio time so the group could record new tracks, the group and producers were influenced by their loud guitar sound and attempted to create a guitar based track. After McDaniels and Simmons recorded their rhymes, Smith developed the track, including inviting his friend [[Eddie Martinez]] to record layer of guitar solos to match the song. On its completion, McDaniels and Simmons were unhappy with the sound as they assumed it would not be as guitar heavy and Profile Records president Cory Robbins was also not confident with it, feeling that it was \"weird\". The group gave a version of the song without the rock backing to [[Kool DJ Red Alert]] to play on New York radio, but it was Smith's version with the guitar that became the more popular version. \"Rock Box\" also featured a music video that became the first [[hip hop]] song to get regular rotation on the music video channel [[MTV]].\n\n\"Rock Box\" was released in early March, three weeks prior to the release of the group's debut album ''[[Run-D.M.C. (album)|Run-D.M.C.]]''. The song was praised in contemporary reviews receiving praise in magazines such as ''[[Creem]]'' and ''[[Rolling Stone]]''. In the 1984 [[Pazz & Jop]] critics poll released by ''[[The Village Voice]]'', \"Rock Box\" tied with [[Afrika Bambaataa]] & [[James Brown]]'s single \"[[Unity (Afrika Bambaataa and James Brown song)|Unity]]\" (1984) at seventh place as one the top singles of the year. Run-DMC would continue their use of rock based tracks on many of the future songs, including \"[[King of Rock (song)|King of Rock]]\" (1985),  \"[[Walk This Way#Run-DMC version|Walk This Way]]\" (1986) and \"[[It's Tricky]]\" (1986).\n\n==Background==\nPrior to the release of \"Rock Box\",  Run-D.M.C. released their first single \"[[It's Like That (Run\u2013D.M.C. song)|It's Like That]]\" in March 1983.{{sfn|Adler|2005|p=6}}{{sfn|Adler|2005|p=7}} The song was released by [[Profile Records]], a small New York-based independent music label known for dance music.{{sfn|Adler|2005|p=7}} Journalist and Run-D.M.C. biographer, [[Bill Adler]] stated that \"It's Like That\" was a large step away from the previous three and a half years of hip hop which was known for polished and high spirited songs released by [[Sugar Hill Records (hip hop label)|Sugar Hill]] record label.{{sfn|Adler|2005|p=7}} This was followed by a tour where the group opened for [[funk music]] bands on the bottom half of double bills.{{sfn|Adler|2005|p=9}} Profile released their second single \"Hard Times\" backed with \"Jam Master Jay\" in December 1983 which charted higher on [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'s \"Black Singles\" chart than \"It's Like That\".{{sfn|Adler|2005|p=9}} \n\nAfter the success of the two singles, Profile Records decided to have Run-D.M.C. make a full-length album for both the group and the label.{{sfn|Adler|2005|p=10}} Profile's president, Cory Robbins, recalled that after the success of \"It's Like That\" the group should record an album, feeling that it would be just a few songs, and Run-DMC already had four.{{sfn|Ro|2009|p=71}} McDaniels, Joseph and Russell Simmons were originally against recording an album.{{sfn|Ro|2009|p=71}} Robbins told them that they would be making these songs anyways and and encouraged them to record despite knowing that hip hop albums had not really sold well before.{{sfn|Ro|2009|p=71}} Profile gave them a $25,000 advance for the album with fifteen thousand going towards recording and the remaining 10,000 being split between Smith, McDaniels, Russell and Joseph Simmons.{{sfn|Ro|2009|p=71}}{{sfn|Ro|2009|p=72}} Whether Jay Mizell (Jam Master Jay) was paid for the record remains unknown.{{sfn|Ro|2009|p=72}}\n\n===Recording===\nJoseph Simmons would tell McDaniels to write about a particular subject which led him to fill his notebook with rhymes.{{sfn|Ro|2009|p=72}} Russel Simmons and Larry Smith would go over lyrics deciding which ones to use, with McDaniels stating that both would \"pass over any references to violence, guns, and shit like that.\"{{sfn|Ro|2009|p=72}} McDaniels stated that Joseph Simmons and himself wanted to created \"beat jams; we wanted to rhyme over the break beats that the DJs like [[Grandmaster Flash]], [[Grand Wizzard Theodore]], [[DJ Charlie Chase|Charlie Chase]], and Tony Tone were dropping on those cassette tapes before records were made.\"{{sfn|Williams|2014}} Initially for \"Rock Box\", McDaniels was interested in using [[Billy Squier]]'s \"[[The Big Beat (Billy Squier song)|The Big Beat]]\" (1980)  as the backing music.{{sfn|Williams|2014}}{{sfn|Stone}} Smith had McDaniels use his [[Oberheim DMX|DMX drum machine]] to lay out the beat which McDaniels changed a bit as he \"didn't want to bite a sample\".{{sfn|Williams|2014}} The song predominantly uses the DMX drum machine while the rest of the track used a real bass, guitar, tambourines and cowbells and keyboards.{{sfn|Williams|2014}} Smith, who played the bass on the track, brought in his friend, [[Eddie Martinez]], from Hollis, Queens to perform guitar on \"Rock Box\".{{sfn|Williams|2014}}{{sfn|Adler|2005|p=10}} McDaniels stated two versions of \"Rock Box\" were created as Joseph Simmons initially just wanted the beat, the rhymes and a little bit of echo on the track.{{sfn|Tannenbaum|Marks|2011|p=274}}{{sfn|Broughton|2018}} When Martinez arrived, they played him the rhythm track and recorded one riff, rewound the tape and had Eddie play again which led to  multitracking his part, which had him playing the harmony with himself, and the solo.{{sfn|Ro|2009|p=74}}\n\nMcDaniels stated he \"didn't want the guitar version playing in the hood.\" and both McDaniels and Joseph Simmons were initially not happy with the rock version.{{sfn|Tannenbaum|Marks|2011|p=274}} McDaniels soon became more comfortable with the song after his friend named Yogi that lived near him kept \"giving [him] all these praises about \u201cRock Box,\u201d and I'm looking at him like, \"You like it?\"{{sfn|Broughton|2018}} Joseph Simmons would appreciate the song later in his career, stating it wasn't \"[[King of Rock (song)|King of Rock]]\" (1985) or \"[[Walk This Way#Run-DMC version|Walk This Way]]\" (1986) that helped them the most, it was \"Rock Box\" that was \"the record that took us out of the hood.\"{{sfn|Adler|2005|p=10}}<ref name=\"gh-label\">{{Cite AV media notes\n| title       = Together Forever - Greatest Hits 1983-1991\n| title-link  = Together Forever: Greatest Hits 1983\u20131991\n| others      =\n| year        = 1991\n| chapter     =\n| url         =\n| at          =\n| type        = liner notes\n| publisher   = [[Profile Records]]\n| id          =FILER 419\n| location    =\n}}</ref>\n\n==Music and lyrics==\n\"Rock Box\" has been described as belonging to the [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] and [[rap rock]] genres.{{sfn|Ostroff|2005}}{{sfn|Beaumont|2015}}{{sfn|Questlove|2012}} According to Simmons, Run-DMC had to wait for the [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band [[Riot V|Riot]] to finish their session before entering the recording studio.{{sfn|Adler|2002|p=91}} Simmons declared that after the group saw the guitars they wanted to use some as well.{{sfn|Adler|2002|p=91}} McDaniels stated that the idea for a rock guitar in the song was created by producer [[Larry Smith (producer)|Larry Smith]].{{sfn|Tannenbaum|Marks|2011|p=274}}  Smith spoke about this stating his background was in [[rock music]] and that Russell Simmons \"didn't care about rock'n'roll.

Robbins described the songs backing music in the ''[[Trouser Press|The Trouser Press Record Guide]]'' as melding a simple bass riff to the \"thunderous rhythm tracks\" and the \"blazing rock guitar\".{{sfn|Robbins|1991|p=566}}\nAdler described the lyrics of \"Rock Box\" as similar to that of their previous song \"[[Sucker MCs]]\".{{sfn|Adler|2002|p=92}} The lyrics of that song were involved disrespecting other rappers and how superior Run-DMCs raps were.{{sfn|Adler|2005|p=58}} Joseph Simmons commented that when writing that song he wanted \"nothing but hardcore [[b-boy]], wizard, winning shit. Def b-boy stuff, like we used to do in the parks\".{{sfn|Adler|2005|p=58}} In the song, Joseph Simmons discusses [[Hip hop fashion|b-boy fashion]] with lyrics of \"[[Calvin Klein (company)|Calvin Klein]]'s no friend of mine / Don't want nobody's name on my behind / It's [[Lee (jeans)|Lee]] on my leg, sneakers on my feet, D by my side, and Jay with the beat.\"{{sfn|Adler|2002|p=92}}\n\n==Release==\n[[File:10.12.14DarrylMcDanielsByLuigiNovi1.jpg|thumb|Darryl McDaniels of Run-DMC said that the release of both \"Rock Box\" and their debut album led to the bands wide-spread popularity.{{sfn|McDaniels|Haring|2001|p=34}}]]\nPrior to releasing the song, Russell Simmons played the track for Robbins at Profile Records who recalled it \"was so weird [...] it just took getting used to.

The song was produced by  [[Larry Smith (producer)|Larry Smith]] and [[Russell Simmons]] and released by [[Profile Records]] in March 1984. Following the popularity of their previous two singles \"[[Hard Times (Run-D.M.C. song)|Hard Times]]\" (1983) and \"[[It's Like That (Run\u2013D.M.C. song)|It's Like That]]\" (1983), Profile Records head suggested to the producers and group that they should attempt to record an album as they already had four songs ready, and releasing a few more would not hurt them. Despite speculating low sales from the label and the group not feeling that hip hop was a genre appropriate for a full-length album, they were given an advance to start recording. This led to Run-DMC members [[Joseph Simmons|Joseph \"Run\" Simmons]] and [[Darryl McDaniels|Darryl \"DMC\" McDaniels]] going through their rhyme book to develop new songs, one of which would become \"Rock Box\". \n\nAfter having to wait for the heavy metal band [[Riot V|Riot]] to finish their studio time so the group could record new tracks, the group and producers were influenced by their loud guitar sound and attempted to create a guitar based track. After McDaniels and Simmons recorded their rhymes, Smith developed the track, including inviting his friend [[Eddie Martinez]] to record layer of guitar solos to match the song. On its completion, McDaniels and Simmons were unhappy with the sound as they assumed it would not be as guitar heavy and Profile Records president Cory Robbins was also not confident with it, feeling that it was \"weird\". The group gave a version of the song without the rock backing to [[Kool DJ Red Alert]] to play on New York radio, but it was Smith's version with the guitar that became the more popular version. \"Rock Box\" also featured a music video that became the first [[hip hop]] song to get regular rotation on the music video channel [[MTV]].\n\n\"Rock Box\" was released in early March, three weeks prior to the release of the group's debut album ''[[Run-D.M.C. (album)|Run-D.M.C.]]''. The song was praised in contemporary reviews receiving praise in magazines such as ''[[Creem]]'' and ''[[Rolling Stone]]''. In the 1984 [[Pazz & Jop]] critics poll released by ''[[The Village Voice]]'', \"Rock Box\" tied with [[Afrika Bambaataa]] & [[James Brown]]'s single \"[[Unity (Afrika Bambaataa and James Brown song)|Unity]]\" (1984) at seventh place as one the top singles of the year. Run-DMC would continue their use of rock based tracks on many of the future songs, including \"[[King of Rock (song)|King of Rock]]\" (1985),  \"[[Walk This Way#Run-DMC version|Walk This Way]]\" (1986) and \"[[It's Tricky]]\" (1986).\n\n==Background==\nPrior to the release of \"Rock Box\",  Run-D.M.C. released their first single \"[[It's Like That (Run\u2013D.M.C. song)|It's Like That]]\" in March 1983.{{sfn|Adler|2005|p=6}}{{sfn|Adler|2005|p=7}} The song was released by [[Profile Records]], a small New York-based independent music label known for dance music.{{sfn|Adler|2005|p=7}} Journalist and Run-D.M.C. biographer, [[Bill Adler]] stated that \"It's Like That\" was a large step away from the previous three and a half years of hip hop which was known for polished and high spirited songs released by [[Sugar Hill Records (hip hop label)|Sugar Hill]] record label.{{sfn|Adler|2005|p=7}} This was followed by a tour where the group opened for [[funk music]] bands on the bottom half of double bills.{{sfn|Adler|2005|p=9}} Profile released their second single \"Hard Times\" backed with \"Jam Master Jay\" in December 1983 which charted higher on [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'s \"Black Singles\" chart than \"It's Like That\".{{sfn|Adler|2005|p=9}} \n\nAfter the success of the two singles, Profile Records decided to have Run-D.M.C. make a full-length album for both the group and the label.{{sfn|Adler|2005|p=10}} Profile's president, Cory Robbins, recalled that after the success of \"It's Like That\" the group should record an album, feeling that it would be just a few songs, and Run-DMC already had four.{{sfn|Ro|2009|p=71}} McDaniels, Joseph and Russell Simmons were originally against recording an album.{{sfn|Ro|2009|p=71}} Robbins told them that they would be making these songs anyways and and encouraged them to record despite knowing that hip hop albums had not really sold well before.{{sfn|Ro|2009|p=71}} Profile gave them a $25,000 advance for the album with fifteen thousand going towards recording and the remaining 10,000 being split between Smith, McDaniels, Russell and Joseph Simmons.{{sfn|Ro|2009|p=71}}{{sfn|Ro|2009|p=72}} Whether Jay Mizell (Jam Master Jay) was paid for the record remains unknown.{{sfn|Ro|2009|p=72}}\n\n===Recording===\nJoseph Simmons would tell McDaniels to write about a particular subject which led him to fill his notebook with rhymes.{{sfn|Ro|2009|p=72}} Russel Simmons and Larry Smith would go over lyrics deciding which ones to use, with McDaniels stating that both would \"pass over any references to violence, guns, and shit like that.\"{{sfn|Ro|2009|p=72}} McDaniels stated that Joseph Simmons and himself wanted to created \"beat jams; we wanted to rhyme over the break beats that the DJs like [[Grandmaster Flash]], [[Grand Wizzard Theodore]], [[DJ Charlie Chase|Charlie Chase]], and Tony Tone were dropping on those cassette tapes before records were made.\"{{sfn|Williams|2014}} Initially for \"Rock Box\", McDaniels was interested in using [[Billy Squier]]'s \"[[The Big Beat (Billy Squier song)|The Big Beat]]\" (1980)  as the backing music.{{sfn|Williams|2014}}{{sfn|Stone}} Smith had McDaniels use his [[Oberheim DMX|DMX drum machine]] to lay out the beat which McDaniels changed a bit as he \"didn't want to bite a sample\".{{sfn|Williams|2014}} The song predominantly uses the DMX drum machine while the rest of the track used a real bass, guitar, tambourines and cowbells and keyboards.{{sfn|Williams|2014}} Smith, who played the bass on the track, brought in his friend, [[Eddie Martinez]], from Hollis, Queens to perform guitar on \"Rock Box\".{{sfn|Williams|2014}}{{sfn|Adler|2005|p=10}} McDaniels stated two versions of \"Rock Box\" were created as Joseph Simmons initially just wanted the beat, the rhymes and a little bit of echo on the track.{{sfn|Tannenbaum|Marks|2011|p=274}}{{sfn|Broughton|2018}} When Martinez arrived, they played him the rhythm track and recorded one riff, rewound the tape and had Eddie play again which led to  multitracking his part, which had him playing the harmony with himself, and the solo.{{sfn|Ro|2009|p=74}}\n\nMcDaniels stated he \"didn't want the guitar version playing in the hood.\" and both McDaniels and Joseph Simmons were initially not happy with the rock version.{{sfn|Tannenbaum|Marks|2011|p=274}} McDaniels soon became more comfortable with the song after his friend named Yogi that lived near him kept \"giving [him] all these praises about \u201cRock Box,\u201d and I'm looking at him like, \"You like it?\"{{sfn|Broughton|2018}} Joseph Simmons would appreciate the song later in his career, stating it wasn't \"[[King of Rock (song)|King of Rock]]\" (1985) or \"[[Walk This Way#Run-DMC version|Walk This Way]]\" (1986) that helped them the most, it was \"Rock Box\" that was \"the record that took us out of the hood.\"{{sfn|Adler|2005|p=10}}<ref name=\"gh-label\">{{Cite AV media notes\n| title       = Together Forever - Greatest Hits 1983-1991\n| title-link  = Together Forever: Greatest Hits 1983\u20131991\n| others      =\n| year        = 1991\n| chapter     =\n| url         =\n| at          =\n| type        = liner notes\n| publisher   = [[Profile Records]]\n| id          =FILER 419\n| location    =\n}}</ref>\n\n==Music and lyrics==\n\"Rock Box\" has been described as belonging to the [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] and [[rap rock]] genres.{{sfn|Ostroff|2005}}{{sfn|Beaumont|2015}}{{sfn|Questlove|2012}} According to Simmons, Run-DMC had to wait for the [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band [[Riot V|Riot]] to finish their session before entering the recording studio.{{sfn|Adler|2002|p=91}} Simmons declared that after the group saw the guitars they wanted to use some as well.{{sfn|Adler|2002|p=91}} McDaniels stated that the idea for a rock guitar in the song was created by producer [[Larry Smith (producer)|Larry Smith]].{{sfn|Tannenbaum|Marks|2011|p=274}}  Smith spoke about this stating his background was in [[rock music]] and that Russell Simmons \"didn't care about rock'n'roll.

Robbins described the songs backing music in the ''[[Trouser Press|The Trouser Press Record Guide]]'' as melding a simple bass riff to the \"thunderous rhythm tracks\" and the \"blazing rock guitar\".{{sfn|Robbins|1991|p=566}}\nAdler described the lyrics of \"Rock Box\" as similar to that of their previous song \"[[Sucker MCs]]\".{{sfn|Adler|2002|p=92}} The lyrics of that song were involved disrespecting other rappers and how superior Run-DMCs raps were.{{sfn|Adler|2005|p=58}} Joseph Simmons commented that when writing that song he wanted \"nothing but hardcore [[b-boy]], wizard, winning shit. Def b-boy stuff, like we used to do in the parks\".{{sfn|Adler|2005|p=58}} In the song, Joseph Simmons discusses [[Hip hop fashion|b-boy fashion]] with lyrics of \"[[Calvin Klein (company)|Calvin Klein]]'s no friend of mine / Don't want nobody's name on my behind / It's [[Lee (jeans)|Lee]] on my leg, sneakers on my feet, D by my side, and Jay with the beat.\"{{sfn|Adler|2002|p=92}}\n\n==Release==\n[[File:10.12.14DarrylMcDanielsByLuigiNovi1.jpg|thumb|Darryl McDaniels of Run-DMC said that the release of both \"Rock Box\" and their debut album led to the bands wide-spread popularity.{{sfn|McDaniels|Haring|2001|p=34}}]]\nPrior to releasing the song, Russell Simmons played the track for Robbins at Profile Records who recalled it \"was so weird [...] it just took getting used to.

A little white boy, too.\"{{sfn|Tannenbaum|Marks|2011|p=274}} \n\nRun-DMC were the first rappers to get significant support from [[MTV]] as the video became the first hip hop music video to be in regular rotation on the channel.{{sfn|Tannenbaum|Marks|2011|p=273}}{{sfn|Linden|1993|p=33}} McDaniels recalled in 2011 that when \"Rock Box\" was shown on MTV, the staff at Profile Records were very excited, while at the time the group were unfamiliar with the network and were more interested in getting videos on thew New York based public access television shows ''[[New York Hot Tracks]]'' and ''[[Video Music Box]]''.{{sfn|Tannenbaum|Marks|2011|p=273}} Joseph Simmons echoed the statement, recalling that the group \"didn't know what MTV was, [...] but everyone was jumping around us like it was a big breakthrough. So we jumped with them.\"{{sfn|Ostroff|2005}} Ann Carli, who worked with promotional material for artists at [[Jive Records]], stated that Run-DMC's videos were played by MTV initially as the network felt Run-DMC \"weren't threatening: they dressed like cartoon characters, in the hats and the jackets [...] a lot of their videos had a cartoon quality, and that was an easier fit for MTV.\"{{sfn|Tannenbaum|Marks|2011|p=275}}{{sfn|George|1990|p=12}} The music video is shown again in a fictional Museum of Rock and Roll in the group's music video for \"[[King of Rock (song)|King of Rock]]\".{{sfn|Tannenbaum|Marks|2011|p=274}}{{sfn|Tannenbaum|Marks|2011|p=275}}\n\n==Reception==\nBill Adler described \"Rock Box\"'s reception as being loved by rock music critics.{{sfn|Adler|2002|p=93}} Roy Trakin praised the song in ''[[Creem]]'', calling it \"a searing rap rocker\" and that the guitar solo by Martinez \"does for hip-hop what [[Eddie Van Halen]] did for [[Michael Jackson]] - bringing it to a whole new audience.\"{{sfn|Adler|2002|p=93}}{{sfn|Adler|2002|p=94}}{{sfn|Trakin|1984}} On reviewing their debut album in August 1984, Debby Miller of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' noted that Run-DMC style of \"Trading off lines or even the words within a line, they get into a vocal tug of war that\u2019s completely different from the straightforward delivery of the Furious Five's Melle Mel or the every-body-takes-a-verse approach of groups like [[The Sequence|Sequence]].\" and noted that varied musical approach of their songs including \"Rock Box\" which \"set their clipped, back-and-forth exchanges to a crying hard-rock guitar solo, melting rap into rock lite it's never been done before.\"{{sfn|Miller|1984}} A reviewer credited as \"Push\" declared in ''Soundcheck'' that was \"a superbly orchestrated collision of funk and ripping guitar\"{{sfn|Push|1984}} Reviewing a Run-DMC concert at the [[Danceteria]], Richard Grable wrote in the 26 May 1984 issue of the ''[[NME]]'' \"\"Rock Box\" is a stroke \u2014 the first guitar-fuelled beat box spawn of \"[[Beat It]]\" to mean anything.\"{{sfn|Grable|1984}} In the 1984 [[Pazz & Jop]] critics poll released by ''[[The Village Voice]]'', \"Rock Box\" tied with [[Afrika Bambaataa]] & [[James Brown]]'s single \"[[Unity (Afrika Bambaataa and James Brown song)|Unity]]\" (1984) at seventh place as one the top singles of the year.<ref>{{cite news|ref=harv|last=Christgau|first=Robert|authorlink=Robert Christgau|url=https://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/pnj/pjres84.php|title=Christgau's Consumer Guide|newspaper=[[The Village Voice]]|accessdate=January 27, 2020|via=robertchristgau.com}}</ref>{{sfn|Cook}}\n\nFrom retrospective reviews, Robbins praised the track in the ''Trouser Press Record Guide'', stating \"Rock Box\" was \"The perfect combination \u2014 verbal acuity and theatrical drama matched by an inexorable pounding beat and the power of electric guitar\" and helped \"chip away the barriers that kept \"black music\" and \"white music\" segregated all through the '70s.\"{{sfn|Robbins|1991|p=566}} Tom Breihan of [[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]] referred to the track as \"The only real misstep\" from their debut album, stating that it \"buries a decent banger under layers of unbearable hair-metal guitar wheedling.\"{{sfn|Breihan|2005}}\n\n==Legacy==\nMartinez would return to play guitar for the group on \"King of Rock\".

[[Ad-Rock]] of the [[Beastie Boys]] stated that the group was inspired by Run-DMC for their first album ''[[Licensed to Ill]]'', specifically noting \"Rock Box\" and \"King of Rock\" as their inspiration for a hybrid of rock and hip hop.{{sfn|Ro|2009|p=166}}{{sfn|Ro|2009|p=167}} Hip hop group [[Whodini]] changed the music they were initally going to have on their album ''[[Escape (Whodini album)|Escape]]'' after hearing \"Rock Box\".{{sfn|Williams|2014}} Their album was initially going to have a rock music backing, but the group went with a more R&B influenced sound on the record after hearing \"Rock Box\".{{sfn|Williams|2014}}\n\n\"Rock Box\" was listed among rapper and producer [[Questlove]]'s top hip hop songs of all time in 2012, noting that the song's importance was not how it fused rock and hip hop even the way it fused rock with hip-hop in a convincing manner but that all hip hop before Run-DMC \"looked like it was part of a Broadway production. [...] America wanted stars that looked and dressed like they did [...] Run-DMC officially ushered in the B-boy period of hip-hop, where the everyman had a chance to escape poverty and invisibility and make it [...] Now the cherry on top was finding the perfect middle in which they could hit two birds with one stone \u2013 rock fans and hip-hop progressives.\"{{sfn|Questlove|2012}} Questlove concluded that \"the single that knocked down many obstacles enabling hip-hop to become the new gospel.\"{{sfn|Questlove|2012}}\n\n==Track listing==\n'''12\" single (PRO-7045)'''<ref name=\"12inch\" />\n# \"Rock Box\" \u2013 6:56\n# \"Rock Box (Vocal Dub Mix)\" \u2013 6:00\n# \"Rock Box (Dub Version)\" \u2013 7:28\n\n==Credits==\nCredits adapted from the liner notes and expanded with information in the article.{{sfn|Adler|2005|p=10}}{{sfn|Williams|2014}}<ref name=\"12inch\">{{Cite AV media notes |title=Rock Box  |others=Run-D.M.C. |type=label |publisher=Profile Records |id=PRO-7045}}</ref>\n* Larry Smith \u2014 producer, composer, bass\n* Russell Simmons\u2014producer\n* Darryl McDaniels \u2014 composer\n* Joseph Simmons \u2014  composer\n* D.J.

They and their contemporaries, the {{sclass-|Des Moines|cruiser|0}} [[heavy cruiser]]s, were the last all-gun cruisers built for the U.S. Navy.

The [[6\"/47]] Mk 16 gun was an autoloading, high-angle dual purpose gun with a high rate of fire, and the Worcesters were thus designed to serve as AA cruisers like the ''Juneaus'' but with much more potent guns, as well as conventional light cruisers.\n\nBoth ships were decommissioned in 1958, the last conventional light cruisers to serve in the fleet, and scrapped in the early 1970s.\n\n== Design ==\nThe ''Worcester-''Class was designed as a departure from the [[Cleveland-class cruiser|''Cleveland''-Class]] Cruiser, and an expansion of the ''[[Atlanta-class cruiser|Atlanta]]'' and ''[[Juneau-class cruiser|Juneau]]'' Classes.
