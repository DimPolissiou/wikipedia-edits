The Majha region consists of several eastern districts of [[Pakistani Punjab]] and in India around [[Amritsar]], [[Gurdaspur]], and surrounding districts. The two most important cities in this area are Lahore and Amritsar.\n* In India technical words in Standard Punjabi are loaned from Sanskrit similarly to other major Indian languages, but it generously uses Arabic, Persian, and English words also in the official language. In India, Punjabi is written in the [[Gurmukh\u012b]] script in offices, schools, and media. Gurmukhi is the official standard script for Punjabi, though it is often unofficially written in the Devanagari or Latin scripts due to influence from [[Hindi]] and [[Indian English|English]], India's two primary official languages at the [[Government of India|Union]]-level.\n* In Pakistan, Punjabi is generally written using the Shahmukh\u012b script, created from a modification of the Persian [[Nasta\u02bfl\u012bq script]].

The ablative occurs only in the singular, in free variation with oblique case plus ablative [[postposition]], and the locative/instrumental is usually confined to set [[adverb]]ial expressions.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Shackle|2003|p=599}}</ref>\n\n[[Adjective]]s, when declinable, are marked for the gender, number, and case of the nouns they qualify.<ref name=\"Shackle2003p601\">{{Harvcoltxt|Shackle|2003|p=601}}</ref> There is also a [[T-V distinction]].\nUpon the [[inflection]]al [[grammatical case|case]] is built a system of [[Grammatical particle|particle]]s known as [[postposition]]s, which parallel [[English language|English]]'s [[preposition]]s. It is their use with a noun or verb that is what necessitates the noun or verb taking the [[oblique case]], and it is with them that the locus of grammatical function or \"case-marking\" then lies. \nThe Punjabi [[verb]]al system is largely structured around a combination of [[Grammatical aspect|aspect]] and [[Grammatical tense|tense]]/[[Grammatical mood|mood]]. Like the nominal system, the Punjabi verb takes a single inflectional suffix, and is often followed by successive layers of elements like auxiliary verbs and postpositions to the right of the [[Root (linguistics)|lexical base]].<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Masica|1991|p=257}}</ref>\n\nThe grammar of the Punjabi language concerns the word order, case marking, verb conjugation, and other morphological and syntactic structures of the Punjabi language.\n\n== Writing systems ==\n{{Arabic-script sidebar|Punjabi}}\n\nThe Punjabi language is written in multiple scripts (a phenomenon known as [[synchronic digraphia]]). Each of the major scripts currently in use is typically associated with a particular religious group,{{sfn|Bhatia|2008|p=128}}{{sfn|Bhardwaj|2016|pp=12\u201313}} although the association is not absolute or exclusive.{{sfn|Jain|2003|pp=53, 57\u20138}}\nIn India, Punjabi [[Sikhs]] use [[Gurmukhi]], a script of the [[Brahmic scripts|Brahmic]] family, which has official status in the state of Punjab. In Pakistan, Punjabi Muslims use [[Shahmukhi]], a variant of the [[Perso-Arabic]] script and closely related to the [[Urdu alphabet]]. The [[Punjabi Hindus]] in India had a preference for [[Devanagari]], another Brahmic script also used for Hindi, and in the first decades since independence raised objections to the uniform adoption of Gurmukhi in the state of Punjab,{{sfn|Nayar|1966|pp= 46 ff}} but most have now switched to Gurmukhi{{sfn|Bhardwaj|2016|p=12}} and so the use of Devanagari is rare.{{sfn|Shackle|2003|p=594}}\n\nHistorically, various local Brahmic scripts including [[La\u1e47\u1e0d\u0101]] and its descendants were also in use.{{snf|Shackle|2003|p=594}}{{sfn|Bhardwaj|2016|p=15}}\n\nThe [[Punjabi Braille]] is used by the visually impaired.\n\n== Sample text ==\nThis sample text was taken from the Punjabi Wikipedia

Previous governments in the area of the Punjab had favoured Persian, Hindustani, or even earlier standardised versions of local registers as the language of the court or government. After the annexation of the [[Sikh Empire]] by the [[East India Company|British East India Company]] following the [[Second Anglo-Sikh War]] in 1849, the British policy of establishing a uniform language for administration was expanded into the Punjab. The British Empire employed Hindi and Urdu in its administration of North-Central and Northwestern India, while in the North-East of India, [[Bengali language]] was used as the language of administration. Despite its lack of official sanction, the Punjabi language continued to flourish as an instrument of cultural production, with rich literary traditions continuing until modern times. The Sikh religion, with its [[Gurmukhi alphabet|Gurmukhi]] script, played a special role in standardising and providing education in the language via [[Gurdwara]]s, while writers of all religions continued to produce poetry, prose, and literature in the language.\n\nIn India, Punjabi is one of the 22 [[scheduled languages of India]]. It is the first official language of the [[Punjab, India|Indian State of Punjab]]. Punjabi also has second language official status in [[Delhi]] along with [[Urdu]], and in [[Haryana]]. <!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:2000 INR Rev 2016.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.68|Punjabi on Indian currency, see in language box on eleventh place]] -->\nIn Pakistan, no [[Languages of Pakistan|regional ethnic language]] has been granted official status at the national level, and as such Punjabi is not an official language at the national level, even though it is the most spoken language in Pakistan after Urdu, the national language of Pakistan.

The only two official national languages in Pakistan are [[Urdu]] and [[Pakistani English|English]], which are considered the [[lingua franca]]s of [[Pakistan]].\n\n===In Pakistan===\nWhen [[Pakistan]] was created in 1947, although Punjabi was the majority language in [[West Pakistan]] and [[Bengali language|Bengali]] the majority in [[East Pakistan]] and [[Pakistan]] as whole, [[English language|English]] and [[Urdu]] were chosen as the national languages. The selection of Urdu was due to its association with [[South Asia|South Asian]] Muslim nationalism and because the leaders of the new nation wanted a unifying national language instead of promoting one ethnic group's language over another. Broadcasting in Punjabi language by [[Pakistan Broadcasting Corporation]] decreased on TV and radio after 1947.  Article 251 of the [[Constitution of Pakistan]] declares that these two languages would be the only official languages at the national level, while provincial governments would be allowed to make provisions for the use of other languages.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pakistani.org/pakistan/constitution/part12.ch4.html|title=Chapter 4: \"General.\" of Part XII: \"Miscellaneous\"|website=pakistani.org|accessdate=30 December 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140603233302/http://pakistani.org/pakistan/constitution/part12.ch4.html|archivedate=3 June 2014}}</ref> However, in the 1950s the constitution was amended to include the [[Bengali language]]. Eventually, Punjabi was granted status as a provincial language in Punjab Province, while the [[Sindhi language]] was given official status in 1972 after [[1972 Language violence in Sindh]].\n\nDespite gaining official recognition at the provincial level, Punjabi is not a language of instruction for primary or secondary school students in Punjab Province (unlike Sindhi and Pashto in other provinces).<ref name=\"Zaidi\">{{cite web|last1=Zaidi|first1=Abbas|title=Linguistic cleansing: the sad fate of Punjabi in Pakistan|url=http://www.gowanusbooks.com/punjabi.htm|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161029194115/http://www.gowanusbooks.com/punjabi.htm|archivedate=29 October 2016}}</ref> Pupils in secondary schools can choose the language as an elective, while Punjabi instruction or study remains rare in higher education.

Until the 1970s, there were a large number of Punjabi-language films being produced by the Lollywood film industry, however since then Urdu has become a much more dominant language in film production. Additionally, television channels in Punjab Province (centred on the Lahore area) are broadcast in Urdu. The preeminence of Urdu in both broadcasting and the [[Lollywood]] film industry is seen by critics as being detrimental to the health of the language.<ref name=\"Masood 2015\">{{cite web | last=Masood | first=Tariq | title=The colonisation of language | website=The Express Tribune | date=21 February 2015 | url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/841584/the-colonisation-of-language/ | accessdate=19 September 2015 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150912044311/http://tribune.com.pk/story/841584/the-colonisation-of-language/ | archivedate=12 September 2015 | df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref name=\"Warraich Ali 2015\">{{cite web|last=Warraich |first=Faizan |last2=Ali |first2=Haider |title=Intelligentsia urges govt to promote Punjabi language |website=DailyTimes |date=15 September 2015 |url=http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/punjab/07-Feb-2015/intelligentsia-urges-govt-to-promote-punjabi-language |accessdate=15 September 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150630230024/http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/punjab/07-Feb-2015/intelligentsia-urges-govt-to-promote-punjabi-language |archivedate=30 June 2015 }}</ref>\n\nThe use of Urdu and English as the near exclusive languages of broadcasting, the public sector, and formal education have led some to fear that Punjabi in Pakistan is being relegated to a low-status language and that it is being denied an environment where it can flourish.

The [[Majhi dialect]] has been adopted as standard Punjabi in Pakistan and India for education, media etc. The Majhi dialect originated in the [[Majha]] region of the Punjab. The Majha region consists of several eastern districts of [[Pakistani Punjab]] and in India around [[Amritsar]], [[Gurdaspur]], and surrounding districts. The two most important cities in this area are Lahore and Amritsar.\n* In India technical words in Standard Punjabi are loaned from Sanskrit similarly to other major Indian languages, but it generously uses Arabic, Persian, and English words also in the official language. In India, Punjabi is written in the [[Gurmukh\u012b]] script in offices, schools, and media. Gurmukhi is the official standard script for Punjabi, though it is often unofficially written in the Devanagari or Latin scripts due to influence from [[Hindi]] and [[Indian English|English]], India's two primary official languages at the [[Government of India|Union]]-level.\n* In Pakistan, Punjabi is generally written using the Shahmukh\u012b script, created from a modification of the Persian [[Nasta\u02bfl\u012bq script]]. In Pakistan, Punjabi loans technical words from [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Arabic]] languages, just like [[Urdu]] does.\n\n== Geographic distribution ==\nPunjabi is the most widely spoken language in [[Pakistan]], the eleventh -most widely spoken in [[India]] and spoken Punjabi diaspora in various countries.\n\n=== Pakistan ===\nPunjabi is the most widely spoken language in [[Pakistan]], being the native language of {{sigfig|44.15|2}}% of its population. It is the provincial language in the [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab Province]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+'''Census history of Punjabi speakers in Pakistan'''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statpak.gov.pk/depts/pco/index.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=17 September 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090926230905/http://www.statpak.gov.pk/depts/pco/index.html |archivedate=26 September 2009 }}</ref>\n|-\n!

[[Ambala]], |Hissar], [[Narnaul]] etc. Not to be confused with the Malvi language, which shares its name.\n\n===Doabi===\n[[Doabi]] is spoken in both the Indian Punjab as well as parts of Pakistan Punjab owing to post-1947 migration of Muslim populace from East Punjab.

At the beginning of a word they became voiceless unaspirated consonants ({{IAST|k, c, \u1e6d, t, p}}) followed by a high-falling tone; medially or finally they became voiced unaspirated consonants ({{IAST|g, j, \u1e0d, d, b}}), preceded by a low-rising tone.

The ablative occurs only in the singular, in free variation with oblique case plus ablative [[postposition]], and the locative/instrumental is usually confined to set [[adverb]]ial expressions.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Shackle|2003|p=599}}</ref>\n\n[[Adjective]]s, when declinable, are marked for the gender, number, and case of the nouns they qualify.<ref name=\"Shackle2003p601\">{{Harvcoltxt|Shackle|2003|p=601}}</ref> There is also a [[T-V distinction]].\nUpon the [[inflection]]al [[grammatical case|case]] is built a system of [[Grammatical particle|particle]]s known as [[postposition]]s, which parallel [[English language|English]]'s [[preposition]]s. It is their use with a noun or verb that is what necessitates the noun or verb taking the [[oblique case]], and it is with them that the locus of grammatical function or \"case-marking\" then lies. \nThe Punjabi [[verb]]al system is largely structured around a combination of [[Grammatical aspect|aspect]] and [[Grammatical tense|tense]]/[[Grammatical mood|mood]]. Like the nominal system, the Punjabi verb takes a single inflectional suffix, and is often followed by successive layers of elements like auxiliary verbs and postpositions to the right of the [[Root (linguistics)|lexical base]].<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Masica|1991|p=257}}</ref>\n\nThe grammar of the Punjabi language concerns the word order, case marking, verb conjugation, and other morphological and syntactic structures of the Punjabi language.\n\n== Writing systems ==\n{{Arabic-script sidebar|Punjabi}}\n\nThe Punjabi language is written in multiple scripts (a phenomenon known as [[synchronic digraphia]]). Each of the major scripts currently in use is typically associated with a particular religious group,{{sfn|Bhatia|2008|p=128}}{{sfn|Bhardwaj|2016|pp=12\u201313}} although the association is not absolute or exclusive.{{sfn|Jain|2003|pp=53, 57\u20138}}\nIn India, Punjabi [[Sikhs]] use [[Gurmukhi]], a script of the [[Brahmic scripts|Brahmic]] family, which has official status in the state of Punjab. In Pakistan, Punjabi Muslims use [[Shahmukhi]], a variant of the [[Perso-Arabic]] script and closely related to the [[Urdu alphabet]]. The [[Punjabi Hindus]] in India had a preference for [[Devanagari]], another Brahmic script also used for Hindi, and in the first decades since independence raised objections to the uniform adoption of Gurmukhi in the state of Punjab,{{sfn|Nayar|1966|pp= 46 ff}} but most have now switched to Gurmukhi{{sfn|Bhardwaj|2016|p=12}} and so the use of Devanagari is rare.{{sfn|Shackle|2003|p=594}}\n\nHistorically, various local Brahmic scripts including [[La\u1e47\u1e0d\u0101]] and its descendants were also in use.{{snf|Shackle|2003|p=594}}{{sfn|Bhardwaj|2016|p=15}}\n\nThe [[Punjabi Braille]] is used by the visually impaired.\n\n== Sample text ==\nThis sample text was taken from the Punjabi Wikipedia

Previous governments in the area of the Punjab had favoured Persian, Hindustani, or even earlier standardised versions of local registers as the language of the court or government. After the annexation of the [[Sikh Empire]] by the [[East India Company|British East India Company]] following the [[Second Anglo-Sikh War]] in 1849, the British policy of establishing a uniform language for administration was expanded into the Punjab. The British Empire employed Hindi and Urdu in its administration of North-Central and Northwestern India, while in the North-East of India, [[Bengali language]] was used as the language of administration. Despite its lack of official sanction, the Punjabi language continued to flourish as an instrument of cultural production, with rich literary traditions continuing until modern times. The Sikh religion, with its [[Gurmukhi alphabet|Gurmukhi]] script, played a special role in standardising and providing education in the language via [[Gurdwara]]s, while writers of all religions continued to produce poetry, prose, and literature in the language.\n\nIn India, Punjabi is one of the 22 [[scheduled languages of India]]. It is the first official language of the [[Punjab, India|Indian State of Punjab]]. Punjabi also has second language official status in [[Delhi]] along with [[Urdu]], and in [[Haryana]]. <!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:2000 INR Rev 2016.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.68|Punjabi on Indian currency, see in language box on eleventh place]] -->\nIn Pakistan, no [[Languages of Pakistan|regional ethnic language]] has been granted official status at the national level, and as such Punjabi is not an official language at the national level, even though it is the most spoken language in Pakistan after Urdu, the national language of Pakistan. It is, however, the official provincial language of [[Punjab, Pakistan]], the second largest and the most populous province of Pakistan as well as in [[Islamabad]] Capital Territory. The only two official national languages in Pakistan are [[Urdu]] and [[Pakistani English|English]], which are considered the [[lingua franca]]s of [[Pakistan]].\n\n===In Pakistan===\nWhen [[Pakistan]] was created in 1947, although Punjabi was the majority language in [[West Pakistan]] and [[Bengali language|Bengali]] the majority in [[East Pakistan]] and [[Pakistan]] as whole, [[English language|English]] and [[Urdu]] were chosen as the national languages. The selection of Urdu was due to its association with [[South Asia|South Asian]] Muslim nationalism and because the leaders of the new nation wanted a unifying national language instead of promoting one ethnic group's language over another. Broadcasting in Punjabi language by [[Pakistan Broadcasting Corporation]] decreased on TV and radio after 1947.  Article 251 of the [[Constitution of Pakistan]] declares that these two languages would be the only official languages at the national level, while provincial governments would be allowed to make provisions for the use of other languages.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pakistani.org/pakistan/constitution/part12.ch4.html|title=Chapter 4: \"General.\" of Part XII: \"Miscellaneous\"|website=pakistani.org|accessdate=30 December 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140603233302/http://pakistani.org/pakistan/constitution/part12.ch4.html|archivedate=3 June 2014}}</ref> However, in the 1950s the constitution was amended to include the [[Bengali language]]. Eventually, Punjabi was granted status as a provincial language in Punjab Province, while the [[Sindhi language]] was given official status in 1972 after [[1972 Language violence in Sindh]].\n\nDespite gaining official recognition at the provincial level, Punjabi is not a language of instruction for primary or secondary school students in Punjab Province (unlike Sindhi and Pashto in other provinces).<ref name=\"Zaidi\">{{cite web|last1=Zaidi|first1=Abbas|title=Linguistic cleansing: the sad fate of Punjabi in Pakistan|url=http://www.gowanusbooks.com/punjabi.htm|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161029194115/http://www.gowanusbooks.com/punjabi.htm|archivedate=29 October 2016}}</ref> Pupils in secondary schools can choose the language as an elective, while Punjabi instruction or study remains rare in higher education.

Until the 1970s, there were a large number of Punjabi-language films being produced by the Lollywood film industry, however since then Urdu has become a much more dominant language in film production. Additionally, television channels in Punjab Province (centred on the Lahore area) are broadcast in Urdu.

Set in [[County Durham]], [[North East England|England]] during the [[UK miners' strike (1984\u20131985)|1984\u201385 miners' strike]], the film is about a working-class boy who discovers his passion for [[ballet]], despite his father's objection and the [[Western stereotype of the male ballet dancer|negative stereotype]] associated of being a male ballet dancer. The film stars [[Jamie Bell]] as 11-year-old Billy, [[Gary Lewis (actor)|Gary Lewis]] as his father, [[Jamie Draven]] as Billy's older brother, and [[Julie Walters]] as his ballet teacher.\n\nAdapted from a play called ''Dancer'' by Lee Hall, development on the film began in 1999. Around 2,000 boys were considered for the role of Billy before Bell was eventually chosen for the role. Filming began in the North of England in August 1999. [[Greg Brenman]] and Jon Finn served as producers, while [[Stephen Warbeck]] composed the film's score. ''Billy Elliot'' is a co-production between [[BBC Films]], [[Tiger Aspect Productions|Tiger Aspect Pictures]] and [[Working Title Films]].\n\nThe film premiered at the [[2000 Cannes Film Festival]], and then began a wider theatrical release on 29 September 2000 by [[Universal Pictures]]. ''Billy Elliot'' received positive critical response and commercial success, earning $109.3 million worldwide on a $5 million budget. At the [[British Academy Film Awards|2001 British Academy Film Awards]], the film won three of thirteen award nominations. The film also earned three [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations, including for [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]], [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]] and [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Actress in a Supporting Role]]. In 2001, the film was adapted into a novel by [[Melvin Burgess]]. The story was also adapted for the [[West End theatre|West End]] stage as ''[[Billy Elliot the Musical]]'' in 2005; it opened in Australia in 2007 and on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in 2008.\n\n== Plot ==\nIn 1984, Billy Elliot, an 11-year-old from the fictional Everington in County Durham, England, loves to dance and has hopes of becoming a professional ballet dancer. Billy lives with his widowed father, Jackie, and older brother, Tony, both coal miners out on [[UK miners' strike (1984\u201385)|strike]] (the latter being the union bully), and also his maternal grandmother, who has [[Alzheimer's disease]] and once aspired to be a professional dancer.\n\nBilly's father sends him to the gym to learn boxing, but Billy dislikes the sport. He happens to see a ballet class that is using the gym while their usual basement studio is temporarily being used as a [[soup kitchen]] for the striking miners. Unknown to Jackie, Billy joins the ballet class. When Jackie discovers this, he forbids Billy to take any more ballet. But, passionate about dancing, Billy secretly continues lessons with the help of his dance teacher, Sandra Wilkinson.[[File:Jamie Bell by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|[[Jamie Bell]] (pictured in 2015) received acclaim for his performance as Billy.|216x216px]]\n\nMrs. Wilkinson believes that Billy is talented enough to study at the [[Royal Ballet School]] in London, but due to Tony's arrest during a clash between police and striking miners, Billy misses the audition. Mrs. Wilkinson tells Jackie about the missed opportunity, but fearing that Billy will be considered to be gay, both Jackie and Tony are outraged at the prospect of him becoming a professional ballet dancer.\n\nOver Christmas, Billy learns his best friend Michael is gay. Billy is supportive of his friend. Later, Jackie catches Billy dancing in the gym and realises his son is truly gifted; he resolves to do whatever it takes to help Billy attain his dream. Mrs. Wilkinson tries to persuade Jackie to let her pay for the audition, but he replies that Billy is his son and he does not need charity. Jackie attempts to [[strikebreaker|cross the picket line]] to pay for the trip to London, but Tony stops him. Instead, his fellow miners and the neighbourhood raise some money and Jackie pawns Billy's mother's jewellery to cover the cost, and Jackie takes him to London to audition.\n\nAlthough very nervous, Billy performs well, but he punches another boy in frustration at the audition, fearing that he has ruined his chances of attaining his dream. He is rebuked by the review board, but when asked what it feels like when he is dancing, he struggles for words but describes it as being \"like electricity\". Seemingly rejected, Billy returns home with his father. Sometime later, the Royal Ballet School sends him a letter of acceptance, coinciding with the end of the miners' strike, and he leaves home for London.\n\nIn 1998, 25-year-old Billy takes the stage to perform the Swan in [[Matthew Bourne]]'s ''[[Swan Lake (Bourne)|Swan Lake]]'', as Jackie, Tony, and Michael watch from the audience; his father visibly moved by the performance.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Jamie Bell]] as Billy Elliot \n** [[Adam Cooper (dancer)|Adam Cooper]] as Billy aged 25\n* [[Julie Walters]] as Sandra Wilkinson\n* [[Gary Lewis (actor)|Gary Lewis]] as Jackie Elliot\n* [[Jamie Draven]] as Tony Elliot\n* [[Jean Heywood]] as Grandma\n* [[Stuart Wells]] as Michael Caffrey\n** Merryn Owen as Michael aged 25\n* Nicola Blackwell as Debbie Wilkinson\n* Colin Maclachlan as Tom Wilkinson\n* [[Mike Elliott (comedian)|Mike Elliott]] as George Watson\n* Billy Fane as Mr Braithwaite\n* Janine Birkett as Jenny Elliot\n* [[Charlie Hardwick]] as Sheila Briggs\n* [[Matthew James Thomas]] as Simon\n* [[Stephen Mangan]] as Dr. Crane\n* [[Patrick Malahide]] as Royal Ballet School principal\n* [[Barbara Leigh-Hunt]] as Royal Ballet School vice-principal\n* [[Neil North]] as Royal Ballet School tutor\n* [[Lee Williams (actor)|Lee Williams]] as Royal Ballet School tutor\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n\n=== Development ===\n[[File:Avon Street, Easington Colliery.jpg|thumb|Terraced homes on Avon Street were used for filming, where Andrew and Alnwick Streets once stood. |alt=|195x195px]]Lee Hall developed ''Billy Elliot'' from his play ''Dancer'', which premiered as a rehearsed reading in 1998 at the [[Live Theatre Company|Live Theatre]] in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Lee Hall interview: Why Lee will always love Live Theatre |date=17 June 2014 |url=http://www.thejournal.co.uk/culture/culture-news/lee-hall-interview-lee-always-7279467 |author=The Journal |work=[[The Journal (newspaper)|The Journal]] |accessdate=6 January 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150106235237/http://www.thejournal.co.uk/culture/culture-news/lee-hall-interview-lee-always-7279467 |archive-date=6 January 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref> He was heavily influenced by photographer [[Sirkka-Liisa Konttinen]]'s book ''Step by Step'', about a dancing school in nearby [[North Shields]].

At first, Daldry was not convinced with the script, but said, \"I liked the emotional honesty of ''Billy Elliot.'' Also Lee writes brilliant kids. And there's a series of themes in it I rather enjoyed: Grief; finding means of self-identification through some sort of creative act, in this case dance; and the miner's strike itself.\"<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.indiewire.com/2000/10/interview-stephen-daldry-dances-to-success-with-billy-elliot-81337/|title=Interview: Stephen Daldry Dances to Success with \"Billy Elliot\"|last=Indiewire|last2=Indiewire|date=2000-10-17|website=IndieWire|language=en|access-date=2020-01-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200102200205/https://www.indiewire.com/2000/10/interview-stephen-daldry-dances-to-success-with-billy-elliot-81337/|archive-date=2 January 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> [[Working Title Films]] approached Daldry to become director and he accepted the offer.

(playwright)|Lee Hall]]. Set in [[County Durham]], [[North East England|England]] during the [[UK miners' strike (1984\u20131985)|1984\u201385 miners' strike]], the film is about a working-class boy who discovers his passion for [[ballet]], despite his father's objection and the [[Western stereotype of the male ballet dancer|negative stereotype]] associated of being a male ballet dancer. The film stars [[Jamie Bell]] as 11-year-old Billy, [[Gary Lewis (actor)|Gary Lewis]] as his father, [[Jamie Draven]] as Billy's older brother, and [[Julie Walters]] as his ballet teacher.\n\nAdapted from a play called ''Dancer'' by Lee Hall, development on the film began in 1999. Around 2,000 boys were considered for the role of Billy before Bell was eventually chosen for the role. Filming began in the North of England in August 1999. [[Greg Brenman]] and Jon Finn served as producers, while [[Stephen Warbeck]] composed the film's score. ''Billy Elliot'' is a co-production between [[BBC Films]], [[Tiger Aspect Productions|Tiger Aspect Pictures]] and [[Working Title Films]].\n\nThe film premiered at the [[2000 Cannes Film Festival]], and then began a wider theatrical release on 29 September 2000 by [[Universal Pictures]]. ''Billy Elliot'' received positive critical response and commercial success, earning $109.3 million worldwide on a $5 million budget. At the [[British Academy Film Awards|2001 British Academy Film Awards]], the film won three of thirteen award nominations. The film also earned three [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations, including for [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]], [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]] and [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Actress in a Supporting Role]]. In 2001, the film was adapted into a novel by [[Melvin Burgess]]. The story was also adapted for the [[West End theatre|West End]] stage as ''[[Billy Elliot the Musical]]'' in 2005; it opened in Australia in 2007 and on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in 2008.\n\n== Plot ==\nIn 1984, Billy Elliot, an 11-year-old from the fictional Everington in County Durham, England, loves to dance and has hopes of becoming a professional ballet dancer. Billy lives with his widowed father, Jackie, and older brother, Tony, both coal miners out on [[UK miners' strike (1984\u201385)|strike]] (the latter being the union bully), and also his maternal grandmother, who has [[Alzheimer's disease]] and once aspired to be a professional dancer.\n\nBilly's father sends him to the gym to learn boxing, but Billy dislikes the sport. He happens to see a ballet class that is using the gym while their usual basement studio is temporarily being used as a [[soup kitchen]] for the striking miners. Unknown to Jackie, Billy joins the ballet class. When Jackie discovers this, he forbids Billy to take any more ballet. But, passionate about dancing, Billy secretly continues lessons with the help of his dance teacher, Sandra Wilkinson.[[File:Jamie Bell by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|[[Jamie Bell]] (pictured in 2015) received acclaim for his performance as Billy.|216x216px]]\n\nMrs. Wilkinson believes that Billy is talented enough to study at the [[Royal Ballet School]] in London, but due to Tony's arrest during a clash between police and striking miners, Billy misses the audition. Mrs. Wilkinson tells Jackie about the missed opportunity, but fearing that Billy will be considered to be gay, both Jackie and Tony are outraged at the prospect of him becoming a professional ballet dancer.\n\nOver Christmas, Billy learns his best friend Michael is gay. Billy is supportive of his friend. Later, Jackie catches Billy dancing in the gym and realises his son is truly gifted; he resolves to do whatever it takes to help Billy attain his dream. Mrs. Wilkinson tries to persuade Jackie to let her pay for the audition, but he replies that Billy is his son and he does not need charity. Jackie attempts to [[strikebreaker|cross the picket line]] to pay for the trip to London, but Tony stops him. Instead, his fellow miners and the neighbourhood raise some money and Jackie pawns Billy's mother's jewellery to cover the cost, and Jackie takes him to London to audition.\n\nAlthough very nervous, Billy performs well, but he punches another boy in frustration at the audition, fearing that he has ruined his chances of attaining his dream. He is rebuked by the review board, but when asked what it feels like when he is dancing, he struggles for words but describes it as being \"like electricity\". Seemingly rejected, Billy returns home with his father. Sometime later, the Royal Ballet School sends him a letter of acceptance, coinciding with the end of the miners' strike, and he leaves home for London.\n\nIn 1998, 25-year-old Billy takes the stage to perform the Swan in [[Matthew Bourne]]'s ''[[Swan Lake (Bourne)|Swan Lake]]'', as Jackie, Tony, and Michael watch from the audience; his father visibly moved by the performance.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Jamie Bell]] as Billy Elliot \n** [[Adam Cooper (dancer)|Adam Cooper]] as Billy aged 25\n* [[Julie Walters]] as Sandra Wilkinson\n* [[Gary Lewis (actor)|Gary Lewis]] as Jackie Elliot\n* [[Jamie Draven]] as Tony Elliot\n* [[Jean Heywood]] as Grandma\n* [[Stuart Wells]] as Michael Caffrey\n** Merryn Owen as Michael aged 25\n* Nicola Blackwell as Debbie Wilkinson\n* Colin Maclachlan as Tom Wilkinson\n* [[Mike Elliott (comedian)|Mike Elliott]] as George Watson\n* Billy Fane as Mr Braithwaite\n* Janine Birkett as Jenny Elliot\n* [[Charlie Hardwick]] as Sheila Briggs\n* [[Matthew James Thomas]] as Simon\n* [[Stephen Mangan]] as Dr. Crane\n* [[Patrick Malahide]] as Royal Ballet School principal\n* [[Barbara Leigh-Hunt]] as Royal Ballet School vice-principal\n* [[Neil North]] as Royal Ballet School tutor\n* [[Lee Williams (actor)|Lee Williams]] as Royal Ballet School tutor\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n\n=== Development ===\n[[File:Avon Street, Easington Colliery.jpg|thumb|Terraced homes on Avon Street were used for filming, where Andrew and Alnwick Streets once stood. |alt=|195x195px]]Lee Hall developed ''Billy Elliot'' from his play ''Dancer'', which premiered as a rehearsed reading in 1998 at the [[Live Theatre Company|Live Theatre]] in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Lee Hall interview: Why Lee will always love Live Theatre |date=17 June 2014 |url=http://www.thejournal.co.uk/culture/culture-news/lee-hall-interview-lee-always-7279467 |author=The Journal |work=[[The Journal (newspaper)|The Journal]] |accessdate=6 January 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150106235237/http://www.thejournal.co.uk/culture/culture-news/lee-hall-interview-lee-always-7279467 |archive-date=6 January 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref> He was heavily influenced by photographer [[Sirkka-Liisa Konttinen]]'s book ''Step by Step'', about a dancing school in nearby [[North Shields]].

At first, Daldry was not convinced with the script, but said, \"I liked the emotional honesty of ''Billy Elliot.'' Also Lee writes brilliant kids. And there's a series of themes in it I rather enjoyed: Grief; finding means of self-identification through some sort of creative act, in this case dance; and the miner's strike itself.\"<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.indiewire.com/2000/10/interview-stephen-daldry-dances-to-success-with-billy-elliot-81337/|title=Interview: Stephen Daldry Dances to Success with \"Billy Elliot\"|last=Indiewire|last2=Indiewire|date=2000-10-17|website=IndieWire|language=en|access-date=2020-01-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200102200205/https://www.indiewire.com/2000/10/interview-stephen-daldry-dances-to-success-with-billy-elliot-81337/|archive-date=2 January 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> [[Working Title Films]] approached Daldry to become director and he accepted the offer.

His brothers got places under the coachman and gardener at the royal castle, and he got one in the kitchen.  \n\nHe did so much better than they did that they became envious and told the coachman that he had said he could get for the king seven silver ducks that belonged to a [[troll]], and which the king had long desired.  The coachman told the king.  When the king insisted that he do it, he demanded wheat and rye, rowed over the lake, in the kneading trough, to the troll's place, and lured the ducks into the trough using the grain.  \n\nThen his brothers told the coachman he had said he could steal the troll's bed-quilt, and the coachman again told the king.  He demanded three days, and when he saw the bed-quilt being hung out to air, he stole it.  This time, the king made him his body-servant.\n\nHis brothers told the coachman he had said he could steal the troll's golden harp that made everyone who heard it glad, and the coachman again told the king.  He said he needed six days to think.  Then he rowed over, with a nail, a birch-pin, and a taper-end, and let the troll see him.  It seized him at once, and put him in a pen to fatten him.  One day he stuck out the nail instead of his finger, then the birch-pin, and finally the taper-end, at which point they concluded he was fat enough.\n\nThe troll went off to ask guests to come, and his daughter went to slaughter the youth.  He told her the knife wasn't sharp enough, sharpened it, and suggested testing it on one of her braids; when testing, he cut off her head and then he roasted half of her and boiled the other, as the troll had said he should be cooked.  He sat in the corner dressed in her clothing, and the troll ate his daughter and asked if he didn't want any.  The youth said he was too sad.  The troll told him to get the harp, and where it was.  The youth took it and set off in the kneading trough again.   The troll shouted after him, and the youth told him he had eaten his own daughter.  That made him burst, and the youth took all the troll's gold and silver, and with them won the princess's hand in marriage and half the kingdom.
