It was designed by [[John Whitton]] in his capacity as Engineer-in-Chief for Railways and built in 1889. It is also known as the '''Michelago Rail Bridge over Ingalara Creek''' and the '''Ingalara Creek Railway Viaduct'''.

At that time, the Engineer-in-Chief for Railways, [[John Whitton]], was under government pressure to reduce construction costs. One common method was to build timber bridges, mostly ballast top timber bream bridges. However, for two major waterways, Ingalara Creek and [[Bredbo River]] ([[Bredbo Rail Bridge]]) he chose to use Queen post deck trusses, a type of timber truss viaduct that he had already used on the [[Main North railway line, New South Wales|Main North line]] between [[Glen Innes, New South Wales|Glen Innes]] and [[Wallangarra, Queensland|Wallangarra]]. Nearer to Cooma, at [[Chakola]], he chose a different type of timber viaduct to cross Umaralla Creek. Several of Whitton's other Queen post deck truss bridges - the Beardy Waters, Severn River and Bluff River viaducts and the Tenterfield Creek bridge - are also heritage-listed.<ref name=nswshr-1048/>\n\n== Description ==\nThe Michelago Rail Bridge over Ingalara Creek is a six-[[Span (architecture)|span]] timber [[Truss bridge|truss]] [[viaduct]].

The Ingalara viaduct is accessible from the [[Monaro Highway]] and is an impressive timber structure. The Cooma Railway made a significant contribution to the development of the [[Monaro (New South Wales)|Monaro Region]] from the time of its construction 1887-89, and all the timber viaducts were important items of the railway's infrastructure. The timber Queen post deck viaduct was a significant structure in place of the expensive iron lattice bridges preferred by John Whitton. The Ingalara viaduct was technically sound and durable, having been built from renowned ironbark hardwood. The two deck Queen post truss timber viaducts on the Cooma Line, together with four on the Main North Line, are a unique class of railway bridge.<ref name=nswshr-1048/>\n\nMichelago rail bridge over Ingalara Creek was listed on the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria.<ref name=nswshr-1048/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.'''\n\nThe timber Queen post truss viaduct was an economic bridge for the Quenbeyan to Cooma Railway at a time when the boom years of the 1880s was ending and funding for railway construction was decreasing.<ref name=nswshr-1048/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.'''\n\nThe viaduct is accessible from the Monaro Highway and is an impressive timber structure.<ref name=nswshr-1048/>\n\n'''The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.'''\n\nThe Cooma Railway made a significant contribution to the development of the Monaro Region from the time of its construction 1887-89, and the three timber viaducts were important items of the railway's infrastructure.<ref name=nswshr-1048/>\n\n'''The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.'''\n\nThe timber Queen post deck viaduct was a significant structure in place of the expensive iron lattice bridges preferred by John Whitton.

Several of Whitton's other Queen post deck truss bridges - the Beardy Waters, Severn River and Bluff River viaducts and the Tenterfield Creek bridge - are also heritage-listed.<ref name=nswshr-1048/>\n\n== Description ==\nThe Michelago Rail Bridge over Ingalara Creek is a six-[[Span (architecture)|span]] timber [[Truss bridge|truss]] [[viaduct]]. Each span is {{Convert|40|ft|m|order=flip|0}} centre-to-centre of timber trestles.<ref name=nswshr-1048/>\n\nThe [[trusses]] are deck [[Queen post]] copied from one of [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]]'s [[Cornish]] timber bridges, called [[Cornwall Railway viaducts#St Germans|St Germans viaduct]], built about 30 years earlier.<ref name=nswshr-1048/>\n\nThe condition was reported to be fair as at 4 April 2006 due to a lack of maintenance since rail services were suspended.<ref name=nswshr-1048/>\n\nAll these viaducts retain their original fabric.<ref name=nswshr-1048/>\n\n== Heritage listing ==\nThe timber Queen post truss viaduct was an economic bridge for the Queanbeyan to Cooma Railway at a time when the boom years of the 1880s were ending and funding for railway construction was decreasing. The Ingalara viaduct is accessible from the [[Monaro Highway]] and is an impressive timber structure. The Cooma Railway made a significant contribution to the development of the [[Monaro (New South Wales)|Monaro Region]] from the time of its construction 1887-89, and all the timber viaducts were important items of the railway's infrastructure. The timber Queen post deck viaduct was a significant structure in place of the expensive iron lattice bridges preferred by John Whitton. The Ingalara viaduct was technically sound and durable, having been built from renowned ironbark hardwood. The two deck Queen post truss timber viaducts on the Cooma Line, together with four on the Main North Line, are a unique class of railway bridge.<ref name=nswshr-1048/>\n\nMichelago rail bridge over Ingalara Creek was listed on the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria.<ref name=nswshr-1048/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.'''\n\nThe timber Queen post truss viaduct was an economic bridge for the Quenbeyan to Cooma Railway at a time when the boom years of the 1880s was ending and funding for railway construction was decreasing.<ref name=nswshr-1048/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.'''\n\nThe viaduct is accessible from the Monaro Highway and is an impressive timber structure.<ref name=nswshr-1048/>\n\n'''The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.'''\n\nThe Cooma Railway made a significant contribution to the development of the Monaro Region from the time of its construction 1887-89, and the three timber viaducts were important items of the railway's infrastructure.<ref name=nswshr-1048/>\n\n'''The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.'''\n\nThe timber Queen post deck viaduct was a significant structure in place of the expensive iron lattice bridges preferred by John Whitton.

Two men ran to help the screaming victim and the dogs attacked them. The men were able to drag the victim next door and close the gate, but the pit bulls found a hole in the fence and resumed the attack. The dogs had chewed off the victim's left hand and his face, leaving an eye hanging out. One of the men got a gun and shot two of the three pit bulls, but the dogs continued attacking, undeterred, until police and EMS arrived, at which point the dogs fled. Authorities arrested the dogs' owner immediately. The victim was airlifted to a hospital in critical condition and died a month later. Both assisting men were seriously injured; one spent 23 days in hospital. The three dogs were caught and put down. The dogs had a history of aggression and being at large. Ricky Davidson, 40, tenant of the neighbor's house, pleaded guilty to one count of reckless endangerment, a gross misdemeanor. Davidson was sentenced to 364 days in jail in connection to the death of Kenneth Ford.

Taipei: Unitas Publishing Co., Ltd., 1997.\u2014A collection of short stories about Syaman Rapongan's life on Lanyu; the book marks the writer's constant struggles with himself and his family because he voluntarily went unemployed and devoted himself solely to the ocean as a bare-hand diver in order to explore Tao civilization and find the meaning of life.

Calling him-self a nomadic soul, Syaman Rapongan knows there may be no end to his battle. His course is a romantic one, without any definite plan. Nor will his beloved sea offer any answer or guidance. Nevertheless, consolation can be found in sweet solitude and family understanding.

Taipei: INK Literary Publishing Co., Ltd., 2009.\u2014Syaman Rapongan's second novel; highly praised and awarded (The Wu Lu-chin Prize for Essays, Chiu Ko Publishing Co. Annual Selection in 2006). Instead of following the previous semi-biographical direction, Syaman Rapongan focuses on three outcasts on his island, Ngalomirem, Tagangan and Zomagpit, whose pretty names fail to bring them pretty lives. Ngalomiren is regarded as a psychopath, Tagangan a miserable student though a brilliant octopus-catcher, and Zomagpit a hopeless drunkard. Through these figures, Syaman Rapongan portrays how Tao society stumbles between traditionality and modernity, and how broken the society has become in both material and mental terms as its humble and simple way becomes recognized again. In spite of a slight hope for reconciliation, this way back to the humble and simple Tao world is arduous, sometimes painful, and fully filled with regrets.\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons

In the early 1870s, [[William Campbell (missionary)|William Campbell]] saw the island from aboard the ''Daphne'', and wrote:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/sketchesfromtaiw00camprich/page/47|title=Sketches from Formosa|author=William Campbell|date=1915|pages=46\u201347}}</ref>\n\n{{quotation|We had a very stormy passage, so much so, that my servant boy and the Chinese preacher (Chiu Paw-ha) who accompanied me, were dead sick during the seven days we were at sea. While laboring off the Island of Botel Tobago, our mainsail was torn in pieces ; and, for several days, every other great sea we faced threatened to engulf us. I was sorry for the poor ship-hands, who had to work hard, and be content with mere snatches of time for food and sleep. It was only through repeated drenchings, and with firm holding on, that I succeeded in getting a good look at the land which came now and then into view.\n\nEvery one was interested as we approached Botel Tobago. The last European visit to it was by a surveying party from H.M.S. ''Sylvia'' in 1867. It stands about twenty-six miles out from the south-eastern end of Formosa, is seven and a half miles long, and densely peopled by an aboriginal race. We saw their huts, and could make out rows of little canoes or rafts drawn up on the beach.}}\n\n=== Imperial Japan ===\nDuring [[imperial Japan|Japan]]'s [[Japanese Taiwan|occupation of Taiwan]], its government declared K\u014dt\u014d Island an [[ethnology|ethnological]] research area off-limits to the general public.\n\n=== Republic of China ===\nAfter the [[Republic of China]] [[Retrocession Day|regained Taiwan]], the island was administered as the Hong-tou-yu \"[[township (Taiwan)|township]]\" of [[Taitung County]] after 19 January 1946 but the Japanese restrictions on visitors remained in effect.

Taipower has for years been exploring ways to ship the nuclear waste overseas for final storage, but plans to store the waste in an abandoned North Korean coal mine have met with strong protests from neighboring South Korea and Japan due to safety and environmental concerns, while storage in Russia or China is complicated by political factors. Taipower is \"trying to convince the islanders to extend the storage arrangement for another nine years in exchange for payment of [[NT$]]200 million (about [[USD|$]]5.7 million)\".<ref name=\"orchis2002\" />\n\nFollowing years of protests by residents, more concerns arose about the facility after Japan's [[Fukushima nuclear disaster]] in 2011. A report released in November 2011 said a radioactive leak had been detected outside the facility and this has added to residents\u2019 concerns. In February 2012, hundreds of Tao living on Orchid Island held a protest outside the nuclear waste storage facility.<ref name=\"tt2012\" /> Chang Hai-yu, a preacher at a local church, said \"it was a tragedy that Tao children are being born into a radiation-filled environment\". Lanyu mayor Chiang To-li \"urged Taipower to remove nuclear waste from the island as soon as possible\".<ref name=\"tt2012\" />\n\nIn March 2012, about 2,000 people staged an anti-nuclear protest in Taiwan's capital [[Taipei]].

In 2011, the average annual electricity consumption per household in Lanyu was 6,522 kWh, almost twice the 3,654 kWh Taiwan average. In 2002, Taipower provided an equivalent of NT$6.35 million worth of electricity to the island, and in 2011 the amount rose to NT$24.39 million. Due to this suspected abuse, members of [[Control Yuan]] called for an investigation into the electricity subsidy to Lanyu Island in 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chinapost.com.tw/taiwan/local/offshore-islands/2012/07/17/347845/Control-Yuan.htm|title=The China Post|website=The China Post}}</ref>\n\n== Tourist attractions ==\n[[File:The Lanyu Lighthouse in Orchid Island 2010-9-14.jpg|200px|thumb|[[Lanyu Lighthouse]]]]\n* [[Lanyu Flying Fish Cultural Museum]]\n* [[Lanyu Lighthouse]]\n* [[Lanyu Weather Station]]\n\n[[File:Lanyu Airport building front 2008b.jpg|thumb|200px|left|[[Lanyu Airport]]]]\n\n== Transport ==\nThe island is accessible by sea or air.

Taipei: Unitas Publishing Co., Ltd., 1997.\u2014A collection of short stories about Syaman Rapongan's life on Lanyu; the book marks the writer's constant struggles with himself and his family because he voluntarily went unemployed and devoted himself solely to the ocean as a bare-hand diver in order to explore Tao civilization and find the meaning of life. The book also marks the writer's initial identity transition from a Sinicized man to a real Tao who embraces the value of physical labor and learns to cultivate the art of story-telling. The book was the Annual Reading for 1997 by United Daily News.\n* Heise de Chibang \u300a\u9ed1\u8272\u7684\u7fc5\u8180\u300b (Black Wings). Taipei: Morning Star Publishing Co., 1999.\u2014Syaman Rapongan's first novel; it questions the future of Tao people through the characterization of four young men (Kaswal, Gigimit, Jyavehai and Ngalolog) Should they run rigorously after the tempting \u2018white body\u2019 on the land or wait patiently for the arrival of \u2018black wings\u2019 on the sea? Although this appears a rhetorical question, Syaman Rapongan reveals that the conflicts are severe and their impact profound. This novel won Wu Zhuo-liou Literary Award in 1999.\n* Hailang de Jiyi \u300a\u6d77\u6d6a\u7684\u8a18\u61b6\u300b (Memory of the Ocean Waves). Taipei: Unitas Publishing Co., Ltd., 2002.\u2014Another collection of short stories; divided into two parts, with the first on the countless ties between Tao and the sea (six stories), and the second on Tao's staunch fights against foreign influences. Experimenting boldly with different genre and languages, the writer combines verses with prose and juxtaposes Tao and Chinese languages. As another Taiwanese writer and critic, Song Ze-lai, points out, Syaman Rapongan deliberately defamiliarizes his language and syntax in order to praise traditional Tao values and to guide his readers, especially Tao, back to the original way of living, far from influences of Chinese culture and modern civilization.\n* Hanghaijia de Lian \u300a\u822a\u6d77\u5bb6\u7684\u81c9\u300b (The Face of a Navigator). Taipei: INK Literary Publishing Co., 2007.\u2014Also a collection of articles; it continues the oceanic theme but exposes more of Syaman Rapongan's personal battles with modernity or traditionality and his pursuit of prosperity or return to innocence. Calling him-self a nomadic soul, Syaman Rapongan knows there may be no end to his battle. His course is a romantic one, without any definite plan. Nor will his beloved sea offer any answer or guidance. Nevertheless, consolation can be found in sweet solitude and family understanding. Syaman Rapongan's first attempt at trans-Pacific navigation with a Japanese captain and five Indonesian crew members is also included here.\n* Lao Hairen \u300a\u8001\u6d77\u4eba\u300b (Old Ama Divers). Taipei: INK Literary Publishing Co., Ltd., 2009.\u2014Syaman Rapongan's second novel; highly praised and awarded (The Wu Lu-chin Prize for Essays, Chiu Ko Publishing Co. Annual Selection in 2006). Instead of following the previous semi-biographical direction, Syaman Rapongan focuses on three outcasts on his island, Ngalomirem, Tagangan and Zomagpit, whose pretty names fail to bring them pretty lives. Ngalomiren is regarded as a psychopath, Tagangan a miserable student though a brilliant octopus-catcher, and Zomagpit a hopeless drunkard. Through these figures, Syaman Rapongan portrays how Tao society stumbles between traditionality and modernity, and how broken the society has become in both material and mental terms as its humble and simple way becomes recognized again. In spite of a slight hope for reconciliation, this way back to the humble and simple Tao world is arduous, sometimes painful, and fully filled with regrets.\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|Lanyu Township, Taitung}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090726225716/http://www.uga.edu/~asian-lp/jpn_html/yami/chpt.1.html Taiwan Aborigine Monograph Series 2]\n* [http://indigenous.pristine.net/perspectives/lanyu/index_en.html Taipei Multicultural Arts Group]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20101003155747/http://www.thewildeast.net/news/2010/06/cultural-survival-on-taiwan%E2%80%99s-orchid-island/ Cultural Survival on Orchid Island]\n* [https://lanyu.land/ Some information and pictures about the island]\n* [http://gptaiwan.yam.org.tw/english_version/nk_dump.html Taipower, North Korea strike accord on nuke waste storage]\n* [http://www10.antenna.nl/wise/index.html?http://www10.antenna.nl/wise/387-8/orchid.html Orchid Island: Taiwan's nuclear dumpsite]\n* [http://reading.udn.com/act/syaman/index-en.html Syaman Rapongan, Taiwan's Ocean Literature Writer]\n* [https://www.bbc.com/news/world-radio-and-tv-15182502 BBC News: Taiwan's paradise island fights to save its identity]\n* [http://www.erenlai.com/en/focus/2011-focus/the-pacific-culture-of-taiwan/item/4132-a-subaqueous-loner-syaman-rapongan.html A subaqueous loner \u2014 Syaman Rapongan]\n\n{{Taiwan Taitung divisions}}\n{{Townships in Taiwan}}\n{{Taiwanese aboriginal areas}}\n{{Taiwan Outlying islands divisions}}\n\n[[Category:Islands of Taiwan]]\n[[Category:Lands inhabited by indigenous peoples]]\n[[Category:Landforms of Taitung County]]\n", "name_user": "SciPunk", "label": "safe", "comment": "added source", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orchid_Island"}

It currently serves as the publishing business for its parent company, [[Activision Blizzard]], and consists of several subsidiary studios.

Note the discussion of this under 'history,' below.-->\n\nThe company was founded as '''Activision, Inc.''' in October 1979 in [[Sunnyvale, California]], by former [[Atari, Inc.|Atari]] game developers, upset at how they were treated at Atari, to develop their own games for the popular [[Atari 2600]] home video game console. Activision '''was the first independent, third-party, console video game developer.''' The [[1983 video game crash]], in part created by too many new companies trying to follow in Activision's footsteps without the expertise of Activision's founders, hurt Activision's position in console games, forcing them to diversify into games for home computers, including the acquisition of [[Infocom]]. After a management shift, with CEO [[Jim Levy]] replaced by [[Bruce Davis (video game industry)|Bruce Davis]], the company renamed itself as '''Mediagenic''' and branched out into business software applications. Mediagenic quickly fell into debt, and the company was bought for around {{USD|500,000}} by [[Bobby Kotick]] and a small group of investors around 1991.\n\nKotick instituted a full rework of the company to cover its debts: dismissing most of its staff, moving the company to Los Angeles, and reverting to the Activision name. Building on existing assets, the Kotick-led Activision pursued more publishing opportunities and, after recovering from the former debt, started acquiring numerous studios and [[intellectual properties]] over the 1990s and 2000s, among these being the ''[[Call of Duty]]'' and ''[[Guitar Hero (series)|Guitar Hero]]'' series. A [[holding company]] was formed as Activision's parent company to manage the internal and acquired studios. In 2008, this holding merged with [[Vivendi Games]] (the parent company of [[Blizzard Entertainment]]) and formed Activision Blizzard, with Kotick as its CEO. Within this structure, Activision serves to manage numerous third-party studios and publish all of the parent company's games outside of those created by Blizzard.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Founding (1979) ===\n[[File:David Crane (10453626776).jpg|thumb|left|Co-founder David Crane in 2013]]\nBy 1979, [[Nolan Bushnell]] had sold [[Atari, Inc.]] to [[Warner Communications]] and then left the company over several disagreements with the direction Warner wanted to take the company\u2014particularly with the popular [[Atari 2600]] game console (then known as the Atari Video Game Console or VCS).<ref>{{cite book |last=Ramsay |first=Morgan |year=2012 |title=Gamers at Work: Stories Behind the Games People Play |isbn=978-1430233510}}</ref> Bushnell's replacement as CEO, [[Ray Kassar]], showed little respect to developers, giving them no financial compensation for profitable games<ref>{{cite web |title=Classic Gaming Expo Distinguished Guest: ALAN MILLER |url=http://www.cgexpo.com/bios/amiller.htm |work=Classic Gaming Expo |publisher=CGE Services, Corp |accessdate=August 22, 2012 |year=1999\u20132010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120208143935/http://www.cgexpo.com/bios/amiller.htm |archivedate=February 8, 2012}}</ref> and refusing them public credit for fear they would be recruited by other game companies.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2016/03/easter-eggs-the-hidden-secrets-of-videogames.html |title=Easter Eggs: The Hidden Secrets of Videogames |first=Jack |last=Yarwood |work=[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]] |date=March 27, 2016 |accessdate=March 27, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160330033934/http://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2016/03/easter-eggs-the-hidden-secrets-of-videogames.html |archive-date=March 30, 2016 |url-status=live}}</ref> [[David Crane (programmer)|David Crane]], one of Atari's [[game programmer|programmers]], recalled a memo sent by Kassar that listed the best-selling cartridges from the previous year to help guide game ideas; Crane noted that the games he was fully responsible for had brought in over {{USD|20 million}} for the company but he was still only receiving a {{USD|20,000}} salary.<ref name=\"Gamasutra\">{{cite web |url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/1537/the_history_of_activision.php?print=1 |title=The History Of Activision |work=Gamasutra |first=Jeffrey |last=Flemming |accessdate=December 30, 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220122651/http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/1537/the_history_of_activision.php?print=1 |archivedate=December 20, 2016}}</ref> Crane, along with [[Larry Kaplan]], [[Alan Miller (game designer)|Alan Miller]] and [[Bob Whitehead]], became vocal about the lack of recognition within the company and became known as the \"Gang of Four\".<ref name=\"Gamasutra\" /> The group met with Kassar in May 1979 to demand that the company treat developers as [[record labels]] treated musicians, with royalties and their names on game boxes.

While there was still a demand for Activision games, uneducated consumers were more drawn to the heavily-discounted titles instead, reducing their income.

It currently serves as the publishing business for its parent company, [[Activision Blizzard]], and consists of several subsidiary studios.

Note the discussion of this under 'history,' below.-->\n\nThe company was founded as '''Activision, Inc.''' in October 1979 in [[Sunnyvale, California]], by former [[Atari, Inc.|Atari]] game developers, upset at how they were treated at Atari, to develop their own games for the popular [[Atari 2600]] home video game console. Activision was the first independent, third-party, console video game developer. The [[1983 video game crash]], in part created by too many new companies trying to follow in Activision's footsteps without the expertise of Activision's founders, hurt Activision's position in console games, forcing them to diversify into games for home computers, including the acquisition of [[Infocom]]. After a management shift, with CEO [[Jim Levy]] replaced by [[Bruce Davis (video game industry)|Bruce Davis]], the company renamed itself as '''Mediagenic''' and branched out into business software applications. Mediagenic quickly fell into debt, and the company was bought for around {{USD|500,000}} by [[Bobby Kotick]] and a small group of investors around 1991.\n\nKotick instituted a full rework of the company to cover its debts: dismissing most of its staff, moving the company to Los Angeles, and reverting to the Activision name. Building on existing assets, the Kotick-led Activision pursued more publishing opportunities and, after recovering from the former debt, started acquiring numerous studios and [[intellectual properties]] over the 1990s and 2000s, among these being the ''[[Call of Duty]]'' and ''[[Guitar Hero (series)|Guitar Hero]]'' series. A [[holding company]] was formed as Activision's parent company to manage the internal and acquired studios. In 2008, this holding merged with [[Vivendi Games]] (the parent company of [[Blizzard Entertainment]]) and formed Activision Blizzard, with Kotick as its CEO. Within this structure, Activision serves to manage numerous third-party studios and publish all of the parent company's games outside of those created by Blizzard.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Founding (1979) ===\n[[File:David Crane (10453626776).jpg|thumb|left|Co-founder David Crane in 2013]]\nBy 1979, [[Nolan Bushnell]] had sold [[Atari, Inc.]] to [[Warner Communications]] and then left the company over several disagreements with the direction Warner wanted to take the company\u2014particularly with the popular [[Atari 2600]] game console (then known as the Atari Video Game Console or VCS).<ref>{{cite book |last=Ramsay |first=Morgan |year=2012 |title=Gamers at Work: Stories Behind the Games People Play |isbn=978-1430233510}}</ref> Bushnell's replacement as CEO, [[Ray Kassar]], showed little respect to developers, giving them no financial compensation for profitable games<ref>{{cite web |title=Classic Gaming Expo Distinguished Guest: ALAN MILLER |url=http://www.cgexpo.com/bios/amiller.htm |work=Classic Gaming Expo |publisher=CGE Services, Corp |accessdate=August 22, 2012 |year=1999\u20132010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120208143935/http://www.cgexpo.com/bios/amiller.htm |archivedate=February 8, 2012}}</ref> and refusing them public credit for fear they would be recruited by other game companies.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2016/03/easter-eggs-the-hidden-secrets-of-videogames.html |title=Easter Eggs: The Hidden Secrets of Videogames |first=Jack |last=Yarwood |work=[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]] |date=March 27, 2016 |accessdate=March 27, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160330033934/http://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2016/03/easter-eggs-the-hidden-secrets-of-videogames.html |archive-date=March 30, 2016 |url-status=live}}</ref> [[David Crane (programmer)|David Crane]], one of Atari's [[game programmer|programmers]], recalled a memo sent by Kassar that listed the best-selling cartridges from the previous year to help guide game ideas; Crane noted that the games he was fully responsible for had brought in over {{USD|20 million}} for the company but he was still only receiving a {{USD|20,000}} salary.<ref name=\"Gamasutra\">{{cite web |url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/1537/the_history_of_activision.php?print=1 |title=The History Of Activision |work=Gamasutra |first=Jeffrey |last=Flemming |accessdate=December 30, 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220122651/http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/1537/the_history_of_activision.php?print=1 |archivedate=December 20, 2016}}</ref> Crane, along with [[Larry Kaplan]], [[Alan Miller (game designer)|Alan Miller]] and [[Bob Whitehead]], became vocal about the lack of recognition within the company and became known as the \"Gang of Four\".<ref name=\"Gamasutra\" /> The group met with Kassar in May 1979 to demand that the company treat developers as [[record labels]] treated musicians, with royalties and their names on game boxes.

Around 2006, Kotick contacted [[Jean-Bernard L\u00e9vy]], the new CEO of [[Vivendi]], a French media conglomerate. Vivendi had a games division, [[Vivendi Games]], that was struggling to be viable at the time, but its principle feature was that it owned [[Blizzard Entertainment]] and its highly-successful ''[[World of Warcraft]]'' game, which was drawing in {{USD|1.1 billion}} a year in subscription fees. Vivendi Games also owned [[Sierra Entertainment]].<ref name=\"forbes kotick\" />\n\nL\u00e9vy recognized Kotick wanted control of ''World of Warcraft'', and offered to allow the companies to merge, but only if L\u00e9vy held the majority shares in the merged group, forcing Kotick to cede control. Kotick fretted about this decision for a while, according to friends and investors. During this time in 2006\u20132007, some of Activision's former successful properties began to wane, such as ''Tony Hawk's'', and Activision faced harsher competition from Electronic Arts, who had purchased Harmonix after Activision bought Red Octane as to develop ''[[Rock Band]]'', a competing title to ''Guitar Hero''.<ref name=\"forbes kotick\" /> Kotick met with Blizzard's president [[Mike Morhaime]], and learned that Blizzard also had a successful inroad into getting their games into China, a potentially lucrative market.
