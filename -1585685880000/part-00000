Iqbal's thoughts in his work primarily focus on the spiritual direction and development of human society, centered around experiences from his travels and stays in Western Europe and the Middle East.

He received considerable recognition from the Punjabi elite after his return from [[England]] in 1908, and he was closely associated with [[Mian Muhammad Shafi]]. When the [[All-India Muslim League]] was expanded to the provincial level, and Shafi received a significant role in the structural organisation of the [[Punjab Muslim League]], Iqbal was made one of the first three joint secretaries along with Shaikh Abdul Aziz and Maulvi Mahbub Alam.<ref>{{Cite book|title=A History of the All-India Muslim League (1906\u20131947)|last=Afzal|first=Rafique M.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2013|isbn=978-0-19-906735-0|location=Karachi, Pakistan|pages=15}}</ref> While dividing his time between law practice and poetry, Iqbal remained active in the Muslim League. He did not support Indian involvement in [[World War I]] and stayed in close touch with Muslim political leaders such as [[Mohammad Ali Jouhar]] and [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]]. He was a critic of the mainstream [[Indian National Congress]], which he regarded as dominated by [[Hindus]], and was disappointed with the League when, during the 1920s, it was absorbed in factional divides between the pro-British group led by Shafi and the centrist group led by Jinnah.<ref name=\"brightpk.com\" />{{unreliable source?|date=May 2012}}\n\nIn November 1926, with the encouragement of friends and supporters, Iqbal contested the election for a seat in the [[Punjab Legislative Assembly]] from the Muslim district of Lahore, and defeated his opponent by a margin of 3,177 votes.<ref name=\"allamaiqbal.com\" /> He supported the [[Fourteen Points of Jinnah|constitutional proposals]] presented by Jinnah to guarantee Muslim political rights and influence in a coalition with the Congress and worked with the [[Aga Khan]] and other Muslim leaders to mend the factional divisions and achieve unity in the Muslim League.<ref name=\"brightpk.com\" />{{unreliable source?|date=May 2012}} While in Lahore he was a friend of [[Abdul Sattar Ranjoor]].<ref name=\"n\">''New Age Weekly''.

Discontent with factional leaders like Shafi and Fazl-ur-Rahman, Iqbal came to believe that only Jinnah was a political leader capable of preserving unity and fulfilling the League's objectives of Muslim political empowerment. Building a strong, personal correspondence with Jinnah, Iqbal was influential in convincing Jinnah to end his self-imposed exile in London, return to India and take charge of the League. Iqbal firmly believed that Jinnah was the only leader capable of drawing Indian Muslims to the League and maintaining party unity before the British and the Congress:\n\n{{quote|I know you are a busy man, but I do hope you won't mind my writing to you often, as you are the only Muslim in India today to whom the community has right to look up for safe guidance through the storm which is coming to North-West India and, perhaps, to the whole of India.<ref name=\"iqbalandpakmovement\" />\n}}\n\nWhile Iqbal espoused the idea of Muslim-majority provinces in 1930, Jinnah would continue to hold talks with the Congress through the decade and only officially embraced the goal of Pakistan in 1940. Some historians postulate that Jinnah always remained hopeful for an agreement with the Congress and never fully desired the partition of India.<ref name=\"jalal14\">Ayesha Jalal, ''The Sole Spokesman'', pp. 14</ref> Iqbal's close correspondence with Jinnah is speculated by some historians as having been responsible for Jinnah's embrace of the idea of Pakistan. Iqbal elucidated to Jinnah his vision of a separate Muslim state in a letter sent on 21 June 1937:\n\n{{quote|A separate federation of Muslim Provinces, reformed on the lines I have suggested above, is the only course by which we can secure a peaceful India and save Muslims from the domination of Non-Muslims. Why should not the Muslims of North-West India and [[Bengal]] be considered as nations entitled to self-determination just as other nations in India and outside India are.<ref name=\"allamaiqbal.com\" />}}\n\nIqbal, serving as president of the Punjab Muslim League, criticised Jinnah's political actions, including a political agreement with Punjabi leader [[Sikandar Hayat Khan (Punjabi politician)| Sikandar Hyat Khan]], whom Iqbal saw as a representative of feudal classes and not committed to Islam as the core political philosophy. Nevertheless, Iqbal worked constantly to encourage Muslim leaders and masses to support Jinnah and the League. Speaking about the political future of Muslims in India, Iqbal said:\n{{quote|There is only one way out. Muslims should strengthen Jinnah's hands. They should join the Muslim League. Indian question, as is now being solved, can be countered by our united front against both the Hindus and the English. Without it, our demands are not going to be accepted. People say our demands smack of communalism, and This is sheer propaganda. These demands relate to the defense of our national existence. The united front can be formed under the leadership of the Muslim League. And the Muslim League can succeed only on account of Jinnah.

The lectures had been delivered at [[Madras]], [[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad]] and [[Aligarh]].<ref name=\"allamaiqbal.com\" /> These lectures dwell on the role of Islam as a religion and as a political and legal philosophy in the modern age.<ref name=\"allamaiqbal.com\" /> In these lectures Iqbal firmly rejects the political attitudes and conduct of Muslim politicians, whom he saw as morally misguided, attached to power and without any standing with the Muslim masses.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nIqbal expressed fears that not only would [[secularism]] weaken the spiritual foundations of Islam and Muslim society, but that India's [[Hindu]]-majority population would crowd out Muslim heritage, culture and political influence. In his travels to [[Egypt]], [[Afghanistan]], [[Iran]] and [[Turkey]], he promoted ideas of greater Islamic political co-operation and unity, calling for the shedding of nationalist differences.<ref name=\"books.google.co.uk\" /> He also speculated on different political arrangements to guarantee Muslim political power; in a dialogue with Dr. [[B. R. Ambedkar]], Iqbal expressed his desire to see Indian provinces as autonomous units under the direct control of the British government and with no central Indian government. He envisaged autonomous Muslim regions in India. Under a single Indian union, he feared for Muslims, who would suffer in many respects, especially concerning their existentially separate entity as Muslims.<ref name=\"allamaiqbal.com\" />\n\nIqbal was elected president of the Muslim League in 1930 at its session in [[Allahabad]] in the [[United Provinces of Agra and Oudh|United Provinces]], as well as for the session in Lahore in 1932. In his [[Allahabad Address|presidential address]] on 29 December 1930 he outlined a vision of an independent state for Muslim-majority provinces in north-western India:<ref name=\"allamaiqbal.com\" />\n\n{{quote|I would like to see the [[Punjab (British India)|Punjab]], [[North-West Frontier Province (1901\u20131955)|North-West Frontier Province]], [[Sind province (1936\u20131955)|Sind]] and [[Baluchistan (Chief Commissioners Province)|Baluchistan]] amalgamated into a single state. Self-government within the [[British Empire]], or without the British Empire, the formation of a consolidated Northwest Indian Muslim state appears to me to be the final destiny of the Muslims, at least of Northwest India.<ref name=\"allamaiqbal.com\" />}}\n\nIn his speech, Iqbal emphasised that, unlike Christianity, Islam came with \"legal concepts\" with \"civic significance\", with its \"religious ideals\" considered as inseparable from social order: \"Therefore, if it means a displacement of the Islamic principle of solidarity, the construction of a policy on national lines, is simply unthinkable to a Muslim.\"<ref name=\"Naipaul\">{{cite book |last=Naipaul |first=V. S. |title=Beyond Belief: Islamic Excursions Among the Converted Peoples |pages=250\u201352}}</ref> Iqbal thus stressed not only the need for the political unity of Muslim communities but the undesirability of blending the Muslim population into a wider society not based on Islamic principles.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nHe thus became the first politician to articulate what would become known as the ''[[Two-nation theory]]''\u2014that Muslims are a distinct nation and thus deserve political independence from other regions and communities of India. Even as he rejected secularism and nationalism he would not elucidate or specify if his ideal Islamic state would be a [[theocracy]], and criticised the \"intellectual attitudes\" of Islamic scholars ([[ulema]]) as having \"reduced the Law of Islam practically to the state of immobility\".<ref name=iqbal-2004-1934-131>{{cite book |title=The Reconstruction of Religious Thought in Islam |edition=reprint |orig-year=1934| date=2004 |location=Lahore |publisher=Sang-e-Meel Publications |page=131 }}</ref>\n\nThe latter part of Iqbal's life was concentrated on political activity. He travelled across Europe and West Asia to garner political and financial support for the League. He reiterated the ideas of his 1932 address, and, during the third [[Round Table Conferences (India)|Round Table Conference]], he opposed the Congress and proposals for transfer of power without considerable autonomy or independence for Muslim provinces.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nHe would serve as president of the Punjab Muslim League, and would deliver speeches and publish articles in an attempt to rally Muslims across India as a single political entity. Iqbal consistently criticised feudal classes in Punjab as well as Muslim politicians opposed to the League. Many accounts of Iqbal's frustration toward Congress leadership were also pivotal in providing a vision for the two-nation theory.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\n=== Patron of ''Tolu-e-Islam'' ===\n[[File:TolueIslam1.jpg|thumb|Copy of the first issue of ''Tolu-e-Islam'']]\nIqbal was the first patron of ''[[Tolu-e-Islam (magazine)|Tolu-e-Islam]]'', a historical, political, religious and cultural journal of the Muslims of British India.

The poems emphasise the spirit and self from a religious perspective. Many critics have called this Iqbal's finest poetic work.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allamaiqbal.com|title=Asrar-e-Khudi|first=Allama Iqbal Academy |last=Official website|accessdate=30 May 2006}}</ref> In ''Asrar-i-Khudi'', Iqbal explains his philosophy of \"Khudi\", or \"Self\".<ref name=\"allamaiqbal.com\" /><ref name=\"books.google.co.uk\" /> Iqbal's use of the term \"Khudi\" is synonymous with the word [[Ruh|\"Rooh\"]] used in the Quran for a divine spark which is present in every human being, and was said by Iqbal to be present in [[Adam]], for which God ordered all of the angels to prostrate in front of Adam.<ref name=\"allamaiqbal.com\" /> Iqbal condemns self-destruction. For him, the aim of life is self-realization and self-knowledge. He charts the stages through which the \"Self\" has to pass before finally arriving at its point of perfection, enabling the knower of the \"Self\" to become a vice-regent of God.<ref name=\"allamaiqbal.com\" />\n\nIn his ''[[Rumuz-i-Bekhudi]]'' (''Hints of Selflessness''), Iqbal seeks to prove the Islamic way of life is the best code of conduct for a nation's viability. A person must keep his characteristics intact, he asserts, but once this is achieved, he should sacrifice his ambitions for the needs of the nation. Man cannot realise the \"Self\" outside of society. Published in 1917, this group of poems has as its main themes the ideal community,<ref name=\"allamaiqbal.com\" /> Islamic ethical and social principles, and the relationship between the individual and society. Although he supports Islam, Iqbal also recognises the positive aspects of other religions. ''Rumuz-i-Bekhudi'' complements the emphasis on the self in ''Asrar-e-Khudi'' and the two collections are often put in the same volume under the title ''Asrar-i-Rumuz'' (''Hinting Secrets''). It is addressed to the world's Muslims.<ref name=\"allamaiqbal.com\" />\n\nIqbal's 1924 publication, the ''[[Payam-e-Mashriq]]'' (''The Message of the East''), is closely connected to the ''West-\u00f6stlicher Diwan'' by the German poet Goethe. Goethe bemoans the West having become too materialistic in outlook, and expects the East will provide a message of hope to resuscitate spiritual values. Iqbal styles his work as a reminder to the West of the importance of morality, religion, and civilisation by underlining the need for cultivating feeling, ardor, and dynamism. He asserts that an individual can never aspire to higher dimensions unless he learns of the nature of spirituality.<ref name=\"allamaiqbal.com\" /> In his first visit to Afghanistan, he presented ''Payam-e Mashreq'' to [[Amanullah Khan|King Amanullah Khan]]. In it, he admired the uprising of Afghanistan against the British Empire. In 1933, he was officially invited to Afghanistan to join the meetings regarding the establishment of [[Kabul University]].<ref name=\"A Spiritual Bridge between East and West\"/>\n\nThe ''[[Zabur-e-Ajam]]'' (''Persian Psalms''), published in 1927, includes the poems \"''Gulshan-e-Raz-e-Jadeed''\" (\"Garden of New Secrets\") and \"''[[Bandagi Nama]]''\" (\"Book of Slavery\"). In \"''Gulshan-e-Raz-e-Jadeed''\", Iqbal first poses questions, then answers them with the help of ancient and modern insight. \"''Bandagi Nama''\" denounces slavery and attempts to explain the spirit behind the fine arts of enslaved societies. Here, as in other books, Iqbal insists on remembering the past, doing well in the present and preparing for the future, while emphasising love, enthusiasm and energy to fulfill the ideal life.<ref name=\"allamaiqbal.com\" />\n\nIqbal's 1932 work, the ''[[Javed Nama]]'' (''Book of Javed''), is named after and in a manner addressed to his son, who is featured in the poems. It follows the examples of the works of [[Ibn Arabi]] and [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]]'s ''[[The Divine Comedy]]'', through [[magic realism|mystical and exaggerated depictions]] across time. Iqbal depicts himself as ''[[Zinda Rud]]'' (\"A stream full of life\") guided by Rumi, \"the master\", through various heavens and spheres and has the honour of approaching divinity and coming in contact with divine illuminations. In a passage reliving a historical period, Iqbal condemns the Muslims who were instrumental in the defeat and death of Nawab [[Siraj-ud-Daula]] of [[Bengal]] and [[Tipu Sultan]] of [[Mysore]] by betraying them for the benefit of the [[British East India Company|British colonists]], and thus delivering their country to the shackles of slavery. In the end, by addressing his son Javid, he speaks to the young people at large, and guides the \"new generation\".<ref name=\"allamaiqbal.com\" />\n\nHis love of the Persian language is evident in his works and poetry. He says in one of his poems:<ref>'' Kuliyat Iqbal'', Iqbal Academy Publications, 1990, Lahore, Pakistan</ref>\n\n{{blockquote|{{nastaliq|\u06af\u0631\u0686\u06c1 \u06c1\u0646\u062f\u06cc \u062f\u0631 \u0639\u0630\u0648\u0628\u062a \u0634\u06a9\u0631 \u0627\u0633\u062a}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allamaiqbal.com/works/poetry/persian/asrar/text/01.htm|title=1|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n''garchi Hindi dar uz\u016bbat <u>sh</u>akkar ast''\n\n{{nastaliq|\u0637\u0631\u0632 \u06af\u0641\u062a\u0627\u0631 \u062f\u0631\u064a \u0634\u064a\u0631\u064a\u0646 \u062a\u0631 \u0627\u0633\u062a}}\n\n''tarz-i guftar-i Dari <u>sh</u>irin tar ast''}}\n\nTranslation: ''Even though in sweetness [[Hindi]]* is sugar'' \u2013 ''(but) speech method in [[Dari language|Dari]] [a Persian dialect] is sweeter *''\n\n=== Urdu ===\nIqbal's ''[[Bang-e-Dara]]'' (''The Call of the Marching Bell''), his first collection of Urdu poetry, was published in 1924. It was written in three distinct phases of his life.<ref name=\"allamaiqbal.com\" /> The poems he wrote up to 1905\u2014the year he left for England\u2014reflect patriotism and the imagery of nature, including the \"''[[Tarana-e-Hind]]''\" (\"The Song of India\"),<ref name=\"A Spiritual Bridge between East and West\"/> and \"''[[Tarana-e-Milli]]''\" (\"The Song of the Community\"). The second set of poems date from 1905\u20131908, when Iqbal studied in Europe, and dwell upon the nature of [[European culture|European society]], which he emphasised had lost spiritual and religious values. This inspired Iqbal to write poems on the historical and cultural heritage of Islam and the Muslim community, with a global perspective. Iqbal urges the entire Muslim community, addressed as the ''[[Ummah]]'', to define personal, social and political existence by the values and teachings of Islam.<ref name=\"allamaiqbal.com\" />\n\nIqbal's works were in Persian for most of his career, but after 1930 his works were mainly in Urdu. His works in this period were often specifically directed at the Muslim masses of India, with an even stronger emphasis on Islam and Muslim spiritual and political reawakening. Published in 1935, ''[[Gabriel's Wing|Bal-e-Jibril]]'' (''Wings of [[Gabriel]]'') is considered by many critics as his finest Urdu poetry and was inspired by his visit to Spain, where he visited the monuments and legacy of the [[Al-Andalus|kingdom of the Moors]]. It consists of [[ghazals]], poems, [[quatrains]] and [[epigrams]] and carries a strong sense of religious passion.<ref name=\"allamaiqbal.com\" />\n\n''[[What should then be done O people of the East|Pas Cheh Bayed Kard ai Aqwam-e-Sharq]]'' (''What are we to do, O Nations of the East?'') includes the poem \"''Musafir''\" (\"Traveler\"). Again, Iqbal depicts Rumi as a character and gives an exposition of the mysteries of [[Shariah|Islamic laws]] and Sufi perceptions. Iqbal laments the dissension and disunity among the Indian Muslims as well as Muslim nations. \"''Musafir''\" is an account of one of Iqbal's journeys to Afghanistan, in which the [[Pashtun people]] are counseled to learn the \"secret of Islam\" and to \"build up the self\" within themselves.<ref name=\"allamaiqbal.com\" /> Iqbal's final work was ''[[Gift from Hijaz|Armughan-e-Hijaz]]'' (''The Gift of Hijaz''), published posthumously in 1938. The first part contains quatrains in Persian, and the second part contains some poems and epigrams in Urdu. The Persian quatrains convey the impression that the poet is travelling through the [[Hijaz]] in his imagination. The profundity of ideas and intensity of passion are the salient features of these short poems.<ref name=\"allamaiqbal.com\" />\n\nIqbal's vision of mystical experience is clear in one of his Urdu ghazals, which was written in London during his student days. Some verses of that ghazal are:<ref name=\"allamaiqbal.com\" />\n\n{{blockquote|At last, the silent tongue of Hijaz has<br />\nannounced to the ardent ear the tiding<br />\nThat the covenant which had been given to the<br />\ndesert-[dwellers] is going to be renewed<br />\nvigorously:<br />\nThe lion who had emerged from the desert and<br />\nhad toppled the Roman Empire is<br />\nAs I am told by the angels, about to get up<br />\nagain (from his slumbers.)<br />\nYou the [dwellers] of the West, should know that<br />\nthe world of God is not a shop (of yours).<br />\nYour imagined pure gold is about to lose it's <br />\nstandard value (as fixed by you).<br />\nYour civilization will commit suicide with its\nown daggers.<br />\nFor a house built on a fragile bark of wood is not longlasting<ref name=\"allamaiqbal.com\" />}}\n\n=== English ===\nIqbal wrote two books, ''[[The Development of Metaphysics in Persia]]'' and ''[[The Reconstruction of Religious Thought in Islam]]'', and many letters in the English language. In these, he revealed his thoughts regarding Persian ideology and Islamic Sufism \u2013 in particular, his beliefs that Islamic Sufism activates the searching soul to a superior perception of life. He also discussed philosophy, God and the meaning of prayer, human spirit and Muslim culture, as well as other political, social and religious problems.<ref name=\"allamaiqbal.com\" />\n\nIqbal was invited to Cambridge to participate in a conference in 1931, where he expressed his views, including those on the [[separation of church and state]], to students and other participants:<ref name=\"allamaiqbal.com\" />\n\n{{quote|I would like to offer a few pieces of advice to the young men who are at present studying at Cambridge. ... I advise you to guard against atheism and materialism. The biggest blunder made by Europe was the separation of Church and State. This deprived their culture of moral soul and diverted it to the atheistic materialism. I had twenty-five years ago seen through the drawbacks of this civilization and, therefore, had made some prophecies. They had been delivered by my tongue, although I did not quite understand them. This happened in 1907. ... After six or seven years, my prophecies came true, word by word. The European war of 1914 was an outcome of the mistakes mentioned above made by the European nations in the separation of the Church and the State.<ref name=\"allamaiqbal.com\" />}}\n\n=== Punjabi ===\nIqbal also wrote some poems in [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], such as \"''Piyaara Jedi''\" and \"''Baba Bakri Wala''\", which he penned in 1929 on the occasion of his son Javid's birthday.

He received considerable recognition from the Punjabi elite after his return from [[England]] in 1908, and he was closely associated with [[Mian Muhammad Shafi]]. When the [[All-India Muslim League]] was expanded to the provincial level, and Shafi received a significant role in the structural organisation of the [[Punjab Muslim League]], Iqbal was made one of the first three joint secretaries along with Shaikh Abdul Aziz and Maulvi Mahbub Alam.<ref>{{Cite book|title=A History of the All-India Muslim League (1906\u20131947)|last=Afzal|first=Rafique M.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2013|isbn=978-0-19-906735-0|location=Karachi, Pakistan|pages=15}}</ref> While dividing his time between law practice and poetry, Iqbal remained active in the Muslim League. He did not support Indian involvement in [[World War I]] and stayed in close touch with Muslim political leaders such as [[Mohammad Ali Jouhar]] and [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]]. He was a critic of the mainstream [[Indian National Congress]], which he regarded as dominated by [[Hindus]], and was disappointed with the League when, during the 1920s, it was absorbed in factional divides between the pro-British group led by Shafi and the centrist group led by Jinnah.<ref name=\"brightpk.com\" />{{unreliable source?|date=May 2012}}\n\nIn November 1926, with the encouragement of friends and supporters, Iqbal contested the election for a seat in the [[Punjab Legislative Assembly]] from the Muslim district of Lahore, and defeated his opponent by a margin of 3,177 votes.<ref name=\"allamaiqbal.com\" /> He supported the [[Fourteen Points of Jinnah|constitutional proposals]] presented by Jinnah to guarantee Muslim political rights and influence in a coalition with the Congress and worked with the [[Aga Khan]] and other Muslim leaders to mend the factional divisions and achieve unity in the Muslim League.<ref name=\"brightpk.com\" />{{unreliable source?|date=May 2012}} While in Lahore he was a friend of [[Abdul Sattar Ranjoor]].<ref name=\"n\">''New Age Weekly''.

Discontent with factional leaders like Shafi and Fazl-ur-Rahman, Iqbal came to believe that only Jinnah was a political leader capable of preserving unity and fulfilling the League's objectives of Muslim political empowerment. Building a strong, personal correspondence with Jinnah, Iqbal was influential in convincing Jinnah to end his self-imposed exile in London, return to India and take charge of the League. Iqbal firmly believed that Jinnah was the only leader capable of drawing Indian Muslims to the League and maintaining party unity before the British and the Congress:\n\n{{quote|I know you are a busy man, but I do hope you won't mind my writing to you often, as you are the only Muslim in India today to whom the community has right to look up for safe guidance through the storm which is coming to North-West India and, perhaps, to the whole of India.<ref name=\"iqbalandpakmovement\" />\n}}\n\nWhile Iqbal espoused the idea of Muslim-majority provinces in 1930, Jinnah would continue to hold talks with the Congress through the decade and only officially embraced the goal of Pakistan in 1940. Some historians postulate that Jinnah always remained hopeful for an agreement with the Congress and never fully desired the partition of India.<ref name=\"jalal14\">Ayesha Jalal, ''The Sole Spokesman'', pp. 14</ref> Iqbal's close correspondence with Jinnah is speculated by some historians as having been responsible for Jinnah's embrace of the idea of Pakistan. Iqbal elucidated to Jinnah his vision of a separate Muslim state in a letter sent on 21 June 1937:\n\n{{quote|A separate federation of Muslim Provinces, reformed on the lines I have suggested above, is the only course by which we can secure a peaceful India and save Muslims from the domination of Non-Muslims. Why should not the Muslims of North-West India and [[Bengal]] be considered as nations entitled to self-determination just as other nations in India and outside India are.<ref name=\"allamaiqbal.com\" />}}\n\nIqbal, serving as president of the Punjab Muslim League, criticised Jinnah's political actions, including a political agreement with Punjabi leader [[Sikandar Hayat Khan (Punjabi politician)| Sikandar Hyat Khan]], whom Iqbal saw as a representative of feudal classes and not committed to Islam as the core political philosophy. Nevertheless, Iqbal worked constantly to encourage Muslim leaders and masses to support Jinnah and the League. Speaking about the political future of Muslims in India, Iqbal said:\n{{quote|There is only one way out. Muslims should strengthen Jinnah's hands. They should join the Muslim League. Indian question, as is now being solved, can be countered by our united front against both the Hindus and the English. Without it, our demands are not going to be accepted. People say our demands smack of communalism, and This is sheer propaganda. These demands relate to the defense of our national existence. The united front can be formed under the leadership of the Muslim League. And the Muslim League can succeed only on account of Jinnah.

The lectures had been delivered at [[Madras]], [[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad]] and [[Aligarh]].<ref name=\"allamaiqbal.com\" /> These lectures dwell on the role of Islam as a religion and as a political and legal philosophy in the modern age.<ref name=\"allamaiqbal.com\" /> In these lectures Iqbal firmly rejects the political attitudes and conduct of Muslim politicians, whom he saw as morally misguided, attached to power and without any standing with the Muslim masses.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nIqbal expressed fears that not only would [[secularism]] weaken the spiritual foundations of Islam and Muslim society, but that India's [[Hindu]]-majority population would crowd out Muslim heritage, culture and political influence. In his travels to [[Egypt]], [[Afghanistan]], [[Iran]] and [[Turkey]], he promoted ideas of greater Islamic political co-operation and unity, calling for the shedding of nationalist differences.<ref name=\"books.google.co.uk\" /> He also speculated on different political arrangements to guarantee Muslim political power; in a dialogue with Dr. [[B. R. Ambedkar]], Iqbal expressed his desire to see Indian provinces as autonomous units under the direct control of the British government and with no central Indian government. He envisaged autonomous Muslim regions in India. Under a single Indian union, he feared for Muslims, who would suffer in many respects, especially concerning their existentially separate entity as Muslims.<ref name=\"allamaiqbal.com\" />\n\nIqbal was elected president of the Muslim League in 1930 at its session in [[Allahabad]] in the [[United Provinces of Agra and Oudh|United Provinces]], as well as for the session in Lahore in 1932. In his [[Allahabad Address|presidential address]] on 29 December 1930 he outlined a vision of an independent state for Muslim-majority provinces in north-western India:<ref name=\"allamaiqbal.com\" />\n\n{{quote|I would like to see the [[Punjab (British India)|Punjab]], [[North-West Frontier Province (1901\u20131955)|North-West Frontier Province]], [[Sind province (1936\u20131955)|Sind]] and [[Baluchistan (Chief Commissioners Province)|Baluchistan]] amalgamated into a single state. Self-government within the [[British Empire]], or without the British Empire, the formation of a consolidated Northwest Indian Muslim state appears to me to be the final destiny of the Muslims, at least of Northwest India.<ref name=\"allamaiqbal.com\" />}}\n\nIn his speech, Iqbal emphasised that, unlike Christianity, Islam came with \"legal concepts\" with \"civic significance\", with its \"religious ideals\" considered as inseparable from social order: \"Therefore, if it means a displacement of the Islamic principle of solidarity, the construction of a policy on national lines, is simply unthinkable to a Muslim.\"<ref name=\"Naipaul\">{{cite book |last=Naipaul |first=V. S. |title=Beyond Belief: Islamic Excursions Among the Converted Peoples |pages=250\u201352}}</ref> Iqbal thus stressed not only the need for the political unity of Muslim communities but the undesirability of blending the Muslim population into a wider society not based on Islamic principles.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nHe thus became the first politician to articulate what would become known as the ''[[Two-nation theory]]''\u2014that Muslims are a distinct nation and thus deserve political independence from other regions and communities of India. Even as he rejected secularism and nationalism he would not elucidate or specify if his ideal Islamic state would be a [[theocracy]], and criticised the \"intellectual attitudes\" of Islamic scholars ([[ulema]]) as having \"reduced the Law of Islam practically to the state of immobility\".<ref name=iqbal-2004-1934-131>{{cite book |title=The Reconstruction of Religious Thought in Islam |edition=reprint |orig-year=1934| date=2004 |location=Lahore |publisher=Sang-e-Meel Publications |page=131 }}</ref>\n\nThe latter part of Iqbal's life was concentrated on political activity. He travelled across Europe and West Asia to garner political and financial support for the League. He reiterated the ideas of his 1932 address, and, during the third [[Round Table Conferences (India)|Round Table Conference]], he opposed the Congress and proposals for transfer of power without considerable autonomy or independence for Muslim provinces.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nHe would serve as president of the Punjab Muslim League, and would deliver speeches and publish articles in an attempt to rally Muslims across India as a single political entity. Iqbal consistently criticised feudal classes in Punjab as well as Muslim politicians opposed to the League. Many accounts of Iqbal's frustration toward Congress leadership were also pivotal in providing a vision for the two-nation theory.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\n=== Patron of ''Tolu-e-Islam'' ===\n[[File:TolueIslam1.jpg|thumb|Copy of the first issue of ''Tolu-e-Islam'']]\nIqbal was the first patron of ''[[Tolu-e-Islam (magazine)|Tolu-e-Islam]]'', a historical, political, religious and cultural journal of the Muslims of British India.

The poems emphasise the spirit and self from a religious perspective. Many critics have called this Iqbal's finest poetic work.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allamaiqbal.com|title=Asrar-e-Khudi|first=Allama Iqbal Academy |last=Official website|accessdate=30 May 2006}}</ref> In ''Asrar-i-Khudi'', Iqbal explains his philosophy of \"Khudi\", or \"Self\".<ref name=\"allamaiqbal.com\" /><ref name=\"books.google.co.uk\" /> Iqbal's use of the term \"Khudi\" is synonymous with the word [[Ruh|\"Rooh\"]] used in the Quran for a divine spark which is present in every human being, and was said by Iqbal to be present in [[Adam]], for which God ordered all of the angels to prostrate in front of Adam.<ref name=\"allamaiqbal.com\" /> Iqbal condemns self-destruction. For him, the aim of life is self-realization and self-knowledge. He charts the stages through which the \"Self\" has to pass before finally arriving at its point of perfection, enabling the knower of the \"Self\" to become a vice-regent of God.<ref name=\"allamaiqbal.com\" />\n\nIn his ''[[Rumuz-i-Bekhudi]]'' (''Hints of Selflessness''), Iqbal seeks to prove the Islamic way of life is the best code of conduct for a nation's viability. A person must keep his characteristics intact, he asserts, but once this is achieved, he should sacrifice his ambitions for the needs of the nation. Man cannot realise the \"Self\" outside of society. Published in 1917, this group of poems has as its main themes the ideal community,<ref name=\"allamaiqbal.com\" /> Islamic ethical and social principles, and the relationship between the individual and society. Although he supports Islam, Iqbal also recognises the positive aspects of other religions. ''Rumuz-i-Bekhudi'' complements the emphasis on the self in ''Asrar-e-Khudi'' and the two collections are often put in the same volume under the title ''Asrar-i-Rumuz'' (''Hinting Secrets''). It is addressed to the world's Muslims.<ref name=\"allamaiqbal.com\" />\n\nIqbal's 1924 publication, the ''[[Payam-e-Mashriq]]'' (''The Message of the East''), is closely connected to the ''West-\u00f6stlicher Diwan'' by the German poet Goethe. Goethe bemoans the West having become too materialistic in outlook, and expects the East will provide a message of hope to resuscitate spiritual values. Iqbal styles his work as a reminder to the West of the importance of morality, religion, and civilisation by underlining the need for cultivating feeling, ardor, and dynamism. He asserts that an individual can never aspire to higher dimensions unless he learns of the nature of spirituality.<ref name=\"allamaiqbal.com\" /> In his first visit to Afghanistan, he presented ''Payam-e Mashreq'' to [[Amanullah Khan|King Amanullah Khan]]. In it, he admired the uprising of Afghanistan against the British Empire. In 1933, he was officially invited to Afghanistan to join the meetings regarding the establishment of [[Kabul University]].<ref name=\"A Spiritual Bridge between East and West\"/>\n\nThe ''[[Zabur-e-Ajam]]'' (''Persian Psalms''), published in 1927, includes the poems \"''Gulshan-e-Raz-e-Jadeed''\" (\"Garden of New Secrets\") and \"''[[Bandagi Nama]]''\" (\"Book of Slavery\"). In \"''Gulshan-e-Raz-e-Jadeed''\", Iqbal first poses questions, then answers them with the help of ancient and modern insight. \"''Bandagi Nama''\" denounces slavery and attempts to explain the spirit behind the fine arts of enslaved societies. Here, as in other books, Iqbal insists on remembering the past, doing well in the present and preparing for the future, while emphasising love, enthusiasm and energy to fulfill the ideal life.<ref name=\"allamaiqbal.com\" />\n\nIqbal's 1932 work, the ''[[Javed Nama]]'' (''Book of Javed''), is named after and in a manner addressed to his son, who is featured in the poems. It follows the examples of the works of [[Ibn Arabi]] and [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]]'s ''[[The Divine Comedy]]'', through [[magic realism|mystical and exaggerated depictions]] across time. Iqbal depicts himself as ''[[Zinda Rud]]'' (\"A stream full of life\") guided by Rumi, \"the master\", through various heavens and spheres and has the honour of approaching divinity and coming in contact with divine illuminations. In a passage reliving a historical period, Iqbal condemns the Muslims who were instrumental in the defeat and death of Nawab [[Siraj-ud-Daula]] of [[Bengal]] and [[Tipu Sultan]] of [[Mysore]] by betraying them for the benefit of the [[British East India Company|British colonists]], and thus delivering their country to the shackles of slavery. In the end, by addressing his son Javid, he speaks to the young people at large, and guides the \"new generation\".<ref name=\"allamaiqbal.com\" />\n\nHis love of the Persian language is evident in his works and poetry. He says in one of his poems:<ref>'' Kuliyat Iqbal'', Iqbal Academy Publications, 1990, Lahore, Pakistan</ref>\n\n{{blockquote|{{nastaliq|\u06af\u0631\u0686\u06c1 \u06c1\u0646\u062f\u06cc \u062f\u0631 \u0639\u0630\u0648\u0628\u062a \u0634\u06a9\u0631 \u0627\u0633\u062a}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allamaiqbal.com/works/poetry/persian/asrar/text/01.htm|title=1|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n''garchi Hindi dar uz\u016bbat <u>sh</u>akkar ast''\n\n{{nastaliq|\u0637\u0631\u0632 \u06af\u0641\u062a\u0627\u0631 \u062f\u0631\u064a \u0634\u064a\u0631\u064a\u0646 \u062a\u0631 \u0627\u0633\u062a}}\n\n''tarz-i guftar-i Dari <u>sh</u>irin tar ast''}}\n\nTranslation: ''Even though in sweetness [[Hindi]]* is sugar'' \u2013 ''(but) speech method in [[Dari language|Dari]] [a Persian dialect] is sweeter *''\n\n=== Urdu ===\nIqbal's ''[[Bang-e-Dara]]'' (''The Call of the Marching Bell''), his first collection of Urdu poetry, was published in 1924. It was written in three distinct phases of his life.<ref name=\"allamaiqbal.com\" /> The poems he wrote up to 1905\u2014the year he left for England\u2014reflect patriotism and the imagery of nature, including the \"''[[Tarana-e-Hind]]''\" (\"The Song of India\"),<ref name=\"A Spiritual Bridge between East and West\"/> and \"''[[Tarana-e-Milli]]''\" (\"The Song of the Community\"). The second set of poems date from 1905\u20131908, when Iqbal studied in Europe, and dwell upon the nature of [[European culture|European society]], which he emphasised had lost spiritual and religious values. This inspired Iqbal to write poems on the historical and cultural heritage of Islam and the Muslim community, with a global perspective. Iqbal urges the entire Muslim community, addressed as the ''[[Ummah]]'', to define personal, social and political existence by the values and teachings of Islam.<ref name=\"allamaiqbal.com\" />\n\nIqbal's works were in Persian for most of his career, but after 1930 his works were mainly in Urdu. His works in this period were often specifically directed at the Muslim masses of India, with an even stronger emphasis on Islam and Muslim spiritual and political reawakening. Published in 1935, ''[[Gabriel's Wing|Bal-e-Jibril]]'' (''Wings of [[Gabriel]]'') is considered by many critics as his finest Urdu poetry and was inspired by his visit to Spain, where he visited the monuments and legacy of the [[Al-Andalus|kingdom of the Moors]]. It consists of [[ghazals]], poems, [[quatrains]] and [[epigrams]] and carries a strong sense of religious passion.<ref name=\"allamaiqbal.com\" />\n\n''[[What should then be done O people of the East|Pas Cheh Bayed Kard ai Aqwam-e-Sharq]]'' (''What are we to do, O Nations of the East?'') includes the poem \"''Musafir''\" (\"Traveler\"). Again, Iqbal depicts Rumi as a character and gives an exposition of the mysteries of [[Shariah|Islamic laws]] and Sufi perceptions. Iqbal laments the dissension and disunity among the Indian Muslims as well as Muslim nations. \"''Musafir''\" is an account of one of Iqbal's journeys to Afghanistan, in which the [[Pashtun people]] are counseled to learn the \"secret of Islam\" and to \"build up the self\" within themselves.<ref name=\"allamaiqbal.com\" /> Iqbal's final work was ''[[Gift from Hijaz|Armughan-e-Hijaz]]'' (''The Gift of Hijaz''), published posthumously in 1938. The first part contains quatrains in Persian, and the second part contains some poems and epigrams in Urdu. The Persian quatrains convey the impression that the poet is travelling through the [[Hijaz]] in his imagination. The profundity of ideas and intensity of passion are the salient features of these short poems.<ref name=\"allamaiqbal.com\" />\n\nIqbal's vision of mystical experience is clear in one of his Urdu ghazals, which was written in London during his student days. Some verses of that ghazal are:<ref name=\"allamaiqbal.com\" />\n\n{{blockquote|At last, the silent tongue of Hijaz has<br />\nannounced to the ardent ear the tiding<br />\nThat the covenant which had been given to the<br />\ndesert-[dwellers] is going to be renewed<br />\nvigorously:<br />\nThe lion who had emerged from the desert and<br />\nhad toppled the Roman Empire is<br />\nAs I am told by the angels, about to get up<br />\nagain (from his slumbers.)<br />\nYou the [dwellers] of the West, should know that<br />\nthe world of God is not a shop (of yours).<br />\nYour imagined pure gold is about to lose it's <br />\nstandard value (as fixed by you).<br />\nYour civilization will commit suicide with its\nown daggers.<br />\nFor a house built on a fragile bark of wood is not longlasting<ref name=\"allamaiqbal.com\" />}}\n\n=== English ===\nIqbal wrote two books, ''[[The Development of Metaphysics in Persia]]'' and ''[[The Reconstruction of Religious Thought in Islam]]'', and many letters in the English language. In these, he revealed his thoughts regarding Persian ideology and Islamic Sufism \u2013 in particular, his beliefs that Islamic Sufism activates the searching soul to a superior perception of life. He also discussed philosophy, God and the meaning of prayer, human spirit and Muslim culture, as well as other political, social and religious problems.<ref name=\"allamaiqbal.com\" />\n\nIqbal was invited to Cambridge to participate in a conference in 1931, where he expressed his views, including those on the [[separation of church and state]], to students and other participants:<ref name=\"allamaiqbal.com\" />\n\n{{quote|I would like to offer a few pieces of advice to the young men who are at present studying at Cambridge. ... I advise you to guard against atheism and materialism. The biggest blunder made by Europe was the separation of Church and State. This deprived their culture of moral soul and diverted it to the atheistic materialism. I had twenty-five years ago seen through the drawbacks of this civilization and, therefore, had made some prophecies. They had been delivered by my tongue, although I did not quite understand them. This happened in 1907. ... After six or seven years, my prophecies came true, word by word. The European war of 1914 was an outcome of the mistakes mentioned above made by the European nations in the separation of the Church and the State.<ref name=\"allamaiqbal.com\" />}}\n\n=== Punjabi ===\nIqbal also wrote some poems in [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], such as \"''Piyaara Jedi''\" and \"''Baba Bakri Wala''\", which he penned in 1929 on the occasion of his son Javid's birthday. A collection of his Punjabi poetry was put on display at the [[Iqbal Manzil]] in Sialkot.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://nation.com.pk/05-Oct-2016/iqbal-s-punjabi-poetry-put-on-display|title=Iqbal's Punjabi poetry put on display|work=[[The Nation (Pakistan)|The Nation]]|date=5 October 2016|accessdate=1 December 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Modern reputation ==\n\n=== \"Poet of the East\" ===\n[[File:Pic iqbal 004.jpg|thumb|right|Allama Iqbal after the conferment of a Doctorate of Literature by the University of the Punjab in 1933]]\nIqbal has been referred to as the \"Poet of the East\" by academics, institutions and the media.<ref name=\"dailytimes\" /><ref name=\"thenews\">{{cite news|url=http://www.thenewstribe.com/2012/04/21/nation-observes-allama-iqbals-74th-death-anniversary/#.UCjm36EaN0x|title=Nation observes Allama Iqbal's 74th death anniversary|newspaper= The Newstribe newspaper|date=21 April 2012|accessdate=13 November 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"dawn\">{{cite news|url=http://archives.dawn.com/weekly/yworld/archive/031108/yworld6.htm|title=Feature: Allama Iqbal\u2014the spiritual father of Pakistan|newspaper=Daily Dawn|date=8 November 2003|accessdate=13 August 2012}}</ref><ref name=Taus-Bolstad>{{cite book|last=Taus-Bolstad|first=Stacy|title=Pakistan in Pictures|year=2008|publisher=Lerner|isbn=978-1-58013-452-1|page=70}}</ref><ref name=Sheikh>{{cite book|last=Sheikh|first=Naveed Shahzad|title=The New Politics of Islam: Pan-Islamic Foreign Policy in a World of States|year=2007|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-44453-8|page=83}}</ref><ref name=Jalal>{{cite book|last=Jalal|first=Ayesha|title=Self and Sovereignty: Individual and Community in South Asian Islam Since 1850|year=2000|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-22078-1|page=565}}</ref><ref name=YAHYA>{{cite journal|last=Yahya|first=MD|title=Traditions of Patriotism in Urdu Poetry: A Critical Study with Special Reference to the Poet of the East Allama Iqbal and His Poetry|journal=Journal of Contemporary Research|year=2013|volume=1|issue=2|url=http://scholarsworld.net/english/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Paper-7.pdf|issn=2319-5789|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150715111050/http://scholarsworld.net/english/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Paper-7.pdf|archivedate=15 July 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe Vice-Chancellor of [[Quaid-e-Azam University]], Dr. Masoom Yasinzai, stated in a seminar addressing a distinguished gathering of educators and intellectuals that Iqbal is not only a poet of the East but is a universal poet.

Iqbal's ''Asrare-i-Khudi'' and ''Bal-i-Jibreel'' are particularly popular in Iran.

At the end of the 1950s, Iranians published the complete Persian works. In the 1960s, Iqbal's thesis on Persian philosophy was translated from English to Persian. Ali Shariati, a Sorbonne-educated sociologist, supported Iqbal as his role model as Iqbal had Rumi. An example of the admiration and appreciation of Iran for Iqbal is that he received the place of honour in the pantheon of the Persian elegy writers.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nIqbal became even more popular in Iran in the 1970s.

The team was led by two-time [[Walter Camp Coach of the Year Award]] winner, [[Bob Stoops]], in his 16th season as head coach. They played their home games at [[Gaylord Family Oklahoma Memorial Stadium]] in [[Norman, Oklahoma]]. They were a member of the [[Big 12 Conference]].\n\nOklahoma, entered the [[2014 NCAA Division I FBS football season|2014 season]] ranked 4th in AP Poll and were projected to capture their first Big 12 title since 2012, finishing 1st in the Big 12 media poll. The Sooners won their first four games of the season, before being upset by then-No. 25 [[2014 TCU Horned Frogs football team|TCU]]. The team also lost to then-No. 14 [[2014 Kansas State Wildcats football team|Kansas State]] two weeks later & then to No. 10 [[2014 Baylor Bears football team|Baylor]], which was the first and only win in Norman for the Bears to date. The Sooners recovered and won their next two games, which included a record-setting performance from freshman running back [[Samaje Perine]], who ran for 427 yards, which broke the single-game rushing record set a week prior by Wisconsin's [[Melvin Gordon]]. They entered the season finale against [[2014 Oklahoma State Cowboys football team|Oklahoma State]] at 8\u20133 at 18th in the AP Poll. However, the Sooners lost in overtime, giving the Cowboys their first win in [[Bedlam Series|Bedlam]] since 2011, which also earned them bowl eligibility and their first win in Norman since 2001. Oklahoma finished out the regular season with an 8\u20134 record, 5\u20134 in Big 12 play to finish in a three-way tie for fourth place.

The team was led by two-time [[Walter Camp Coach of the Year Award]] winner, [[Bob Stoops]], in his 16th season as head coach. They played their home games at [[Gaylord Family Oklahoma Memorial Stadium]] in [[Norman, Oklahoma]]. They were a member of the [[Big 12 Conference]].\n\nOklahoma, entered the [[2014 NCAA Division I FBS football season|2014 season]] ranked 4th in AP Poll and were projected to capture their first Big 12 title since 2012, finishing 1st in the Big 12 media poll. The Sooners won their first four games of the season, before being upset by then then-No. 25 [[2014 TCU Horned Frogs football team|TCU]]. The team also lost to then-No. 14 [[2014 Kansas State Wildcats football team|Kansas State]] two weeks later & then to No. 10 [[2014 Baylor Bears football team|Baylor]], which was the first and only win in Norman for the Bears to date. The Sooners recovered and won their next two games, which included a record-setting performance from freshman running back [[Samaje Perine]], who ran for 427 yards, which broke the single-game rushing record set a week prior by Wisconsin's [[Melvin Gordon]].

It is set in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU), sharing continuity with [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|the films]] and other [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe television series|television series of the franchise]]. The series is produced by [[ABC Studios#ABC Signature|ABC Signature Studios]], [[Marvel Television]], and Wandering Rocks Productions, with Pokaski serving as [[showrunner]].\n\nThe series stars [[Olivia Holt]] and [[Aubrey Joseph]] as Tandy Bowen / Dagger and Tyrone Johnson / Cloak, two teenagers with superpowers who form a partnership. A television series featuring the pair had begun development at [[ABC Family]] in July 2011. The channel, renamed Freeform, ordered ''Cloak & Dagger'' to series in April 2016, and Pokaski had joined as showrunner by that August. Holt and Joseph were cast in January 2017, with [[Gloria Reuben]], [[Andrea Roth]], [[J. D. Evermore]], [[Miles Mussenden]], Carl Lundstedt, [[Emma Lahana]], and [[Jaime Zevallos]] also starring in the series. Filming for the series takes place in New Orleans.\n\nThe [[Cloak & Dagger (season 1)|first season]] aired from June 7 to August 2, 2018, and was met with positive reviews. Freeform renewed the series for [[Cloak & Dagger (season 2)|a second season]] in July 2018, which premiered on April 4, 2019 and concluded on May 30, 2019. The series was canceled on October 24, 2019.\n\n==Premise==\nIn [[New Orleans, Louisiana]], teenagers [[Cloak and Dagger (comics)|Tandy Bowen and Tyrone Johnson]] come from different backgrounds and have acquired superpowers after a life-changing event that revolved around the collapse of the [[Roxxon Energy Corporation|Roxxon]] Gulf Platform. As their friendship unfolds, they soon realize that their powers work better when they are together, they use these powers to try to fix some of the wrong in the world.\n\nIn season two, Tandy and Tyrone work to solve the abductions of women run by Andre Deschaine while dealing with Brigid O'Reilly's vigilante half [[Mayhem (comics)|Mayhem]].\n\n==Cast and characters==\n===Main===\n<!-- Order per the opening credits -->\n* [[Olivia Holt]] as [[Cloak and Dagger (comics)|Tandy Bowen / Dagger]]: <br />A teenager and street thief who is connected to Tyrone Johnson through a shared childhood tragedy,<ref name=\"/FilmSXSW\" /> with the ability to emit light daggers.<ref name=\"C&DCast\" /> Showrunner [[Joe Pokaski]] felt Bowen in the series was \"more cynical\" than previous portrayals, and noted that when she touches people she can access their hopes and desires, saying, \"There's something exciting about having a cynical character like Tandy who steals things and doesn't believe in the good of man, yet sees the best in them when she touches them\".<ref name=\"PokaskiTVLineJun2018\" /> Rachel Ryals portrays a young Tandy.<ref name=\"THRReview\" />\n* [[Aubrey Joseph]] as [[Cloak and Dagger (comics)|Tyrone Johnson / Cloak]]: <br />A teenager, who is connected to Tandy Bowen through a shared childhood tragedy, with the ability to engulf others in darkness and transport them through the [[Darkforce]] Dimension.<ref name=\"C&DCast\" /><ref name=\"/FilmSXSW\" /> Johnson has the ability to witness people's fears, having been \"living in a world of fear\" since the death of his older brother Billy.

The series, which would be set in post-[[Hurricane Katrina]] [[New Orleans]], would follow [[Cloak and Dagger (comics)|Cloak and Dagger]] as the two \"find each other and realize that their powers both complement and complicate their lives.\"<ref name=\"ABCFamilyDevelopment\" /> Around this time, Loeb had a meeting with ABC Family, who recommended [[Joe Pokaski]] to Loeb as a potential writer to work with Marvel Television, based on a script for another series the channel had recently received from Pokaski. Loeb reached out to Pokaski about working with Marvel, who was interested in writing Cloak and Dagger since \"there's something that felt so right about them for the television format\", and wrote the script. Pokaski was attracted to Cloak and Dagger as a television series, because the duo are the only people who understand each other's situations, compared to other coming-of-age teenage television series such as ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'' or ''[[Smallville]]'' where the main characters have no one who can relate to them.<ref name=\"VulturePokaskiAug2018\" />\n\nIn April 2016, the series received a straight-to-series order for [[Freeform (TV channel)|Freeform]], the new name of ABC Family, from [[ABC Studios#ABC Signature|ABC Signature Studios]] and Marvel Television.<ref name=\"SeriesOrder\" /> By August 2016, Pokaski had signed on to the series as showrunner and executive producer.<ref name=\"LoebGeekingOut\" /><ref name=\"Pokaski\" /><ref name=\"EPs\" /> Pokaski noted his script had \"sat in a drawer for five years\", before Freeform executive Karey Burke found it and \"took a chance on it\".<ref name=\"VulturePokaskiAug2018\" /> Loeb, Jim Chory,<ref name=\"LoebEP\" /><ref name=\"EPs\" /> [[Alan Fine (executive)|Alan Fine]], [[Stan Lee]], [[Joe Quesada]], and Karim Zreik also serve as executive producers, while Jenny Klein produces the series.<ref name=\"ScienceFictionCast\" /> On July 20, 2018, Freeform renewed the series for a 10-episode second season, which premiered on April 4, 2019.<ref name=\"S2Deadline\" /><ref name=\"CDS2Premiere\" /> The series was canceled on October 24, 2019.<ref name=\"CDCanceled\" />\n\n===Writing===\n{{quote box|width=33%|align=right|quote=... [I]t all starts with representation ... [W]e make sure our writers room is filled with as many people who do not look like me as possible. We have really good writers who allow ourselves a wide enough berth to have real conversations and find the truth across our experiences. That's the key; it's what people talk about a lot but we try to actually execute it.|source= \u2014Showrunner Joe Pokaski on having diversity in the series' writers and the issues the series can explore.<ref name=\"THRS2Aug2018\" />}}\n\nWhen announcing the series, Freeform called it their \"first venture into the Marvel Cinematic Universe\", and described it as a \"superhero love story\", a premise that ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' called \"a seamless fit for Freeform\" given the channel's target audience of \"Becomers\" (the 14\u201334 age demographic).<ref name=\"SeriesOrder\" /><ref name=\"MCU\" /> Addressing this, Loeb said, \"It's a love story that happens to have characters that have always traditionally been in that age group. It's not like we took something and made it into a [[Young adult fiction]]. It speaks to a YA audience and is a YA property. Would I do ''[[The Punisher (TV series)|Punisher]]'' on Freeform? I don't think that's going to connect the same way.\"<ref name=\"LoebAug2016\" /> Pokaski was pleased with the diversity of the writers for the first season, with a majority of black writers and many female writers.<ref name=\"PokaskiColliderJul2018\" /> The majority of the writers from the first season returned for the second. The second season would explore the themes of women's rights and issues through Mina Hess, while \"continuing to drive the conversation forward about race in America\".<ref name=\"THRS2Aug2018\" />\n\nPokaski spoke about the differences in Cloak and Dagger's origin story from the comics, saying, \"I think the original [comic] stories were fantastic, but for the time, while they were a little progressive, they were a little bit sexist and racist once you got into it, for now. What we tried to do was deconstruct it and make it about Tandy and Tyrone, understand who they were.\"<ref name=\"WonderCon\" /> Since the original comics \"are a little dated\", Pokaski and the writers could to make adjustments accordingly as Cloak and Dagger do not have an established comics mythology, making sure \"we were telling the right story for now\".<ref name=\"VulturePokaskiAug2018\" /> He also felt Loeb's idea of having the duo live in New Orleans, opposed to New York City as in the comics, was a \"great idea\".<ref name=\"WonderCon\" /> Since Marvel was also developing ''[[The Defenders (miniseries)|The Defenders]]'' at the same time, moving to the New Orleans setting \"came up pretty early\", since Pokaski felt New York City of the Marvel Cinematic Universe had enough superheroes. When looking for alternate locations, and considering places with filming [[tax incentive]]s, New Orleans \"felt so right for Tandy and Tyrone. It felt gothic, it felt a little bit dark, it felt like a place of light and shadow. The more we learned about the city and about its history and about [[voudon]] or the [[Mardi Gras Indians]], it felt like it was the only place for Tandy and Tyrone to start.\"<ref name=\"VulturePokaskiAug2018\" />\n\nPokaski did not want to rush the romantic relationship between the duo in the first season, and hoped the series would last long enough to allow for \"an interesting path to their relationship.\"<ref name=\"PokaskiTVLineJun2018\" /> Pokaski has an intent to create 100 episodes for the series, with \"a definitive plan for five season\" created.<ref name=\"PokaskiColliderJul2018\" />\n\n===Casting===\n[[File:Olivia Holt & Aubrey Joseph by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|[[Olivia Holt]] and [[Aubrey Joseph]] at [[WonderCon]] 2018 promoting ''Cloak & Dagger'']]\nIn January 2017, it was announced that [[Olivia Holt]] and [[Aubrey Joseph]] had been cast as Tandy Bowen / Dagger and Tyrone Johnson / Cloak, respectively.<ref name=\"C&DCast\" /> [[Gina Prince-Bythewood]], the director of the first episode, called the casting process \"really, really tough ... it was three days before we were supposed to leave [to begin filming] and we didn't find [actors for Tandy and Tyrone]. People started getting willing to settle and the people that were on the table were 27, 28. They felt grown and it didn't feel right for the show. Then Aubrey and Olivia walked in the door, and they had such great chops individually\".<ref name=\"WonderCon\" />\n\nThe following month, [[Andrea Roth]] was cast as [[Melissa Bowen]], Tandy's mother;<ref name=\"AdditionalCast\" /> [[Gloria Reuben]] and [[Miles Mussenden]] were cast as Tyrone's parents, [[Otis and Adina Johnson|Adina and Otis Johnson]];<ref name=\"AdditionalCast\" /><ref name=\"MussendenOtis\" /> and Carl Lundstedt and [[J.

Because of other commitments, she did not plan to continue with the series, and, along with Prince-Bythewood, recommended Cliff Charles to replace her, who served as cinematographer on the remaining episodes of season one.<ref name=\"DPsSeason1\" /> The first season features many [[hand-held camera]] shots that established the \"look and feel\" of the series, in part because Pokaski \"didn't want to wait for a [[Camera dolly|dolly track]] to be laid\".<ref name=\"PokaskiColliderJul2018\" />\n\n===Music===\n[[Mark Isham]] announced in May 2017 that he would compose the music for the series.<ref name=\"Isham\" /> Multiple songs are featured throughout the first season,<ref name=\"OtherMusic\" /> some of which were collected and released on a digital soundtrack album on June 8, 2018, by [[Marvel Music]] and [[Hollywood Records]].<ref name=\"Soundtrack\" /><ref name=\"Soundtrack2\" /> An album featuring Isham's score was released digitally on July 6.<ref name=\"ScoreAlbum\" />\n\n===Marvel Cinematic Universe tie-ins===\nFreeform executive Karey Burke said in April 2017 that the series is \"not particularly connected\" to ''[[New Warriors (TV series)|New Warriors]]'', which was slated to air on Freeform at the time, given \"their tones are so wildly different\", adding, \"There are many degrees of separation with where they fall in the Marvel universe. But anything is possible with Marvel.\"<ref name=\"NewWarriorsApril2017\" /> In July, Loeb said there were no plans to crossover, nor to crossover across networks with the similarly themed ''[[Runaways (TV series)|Runaways]]'' on [[Hulu]]. He added that Marvel wanted the series to find its footing before further connecting with other elements of the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]], saying \"You'll see things that comment on each other; we try to touch base wherever we can ... things that are happening in L.A. [where ''Runaways'' is set] are not exactly going to be affecting what's happening in New Orleans ... It's being aware of it and trying to find a way for it to be able to discuss in a way that makes sense.\"<ref name=\"TCAJul2017THR\" />\n\nAhead of the series premiere, considering the larger events of the MCU at that point, Pokaski said he was \"not allowed to talk about\" how the series would connect to the events of ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'' but stated \"We've had some exciting conversations about how we could artfully cross Tandy and Tyrone over [to other Marvel properties]. The beauty of these two is that they can show up anywhere [and it makes sense].\"<ref name=\"PokaskiTVLineJun2018\" /> After the first season finale, Pokaski expanded, saying he would \"love\" to have Tandy and Tyrone appear in the MCU films \"as utility players the way they are in comics\", but conceded \"there are a lot of legal hurdles and corporate barriers to doing that\".

He concluded, \"''Cloak & Dagger'' could be something unique and potentially lovely: an attempt to build a new bit of filmed superhero iconography (mostly) from the ground up. There's so much to mine in this genre. It deals metaphorically with the burdens, risks, and liberations of power\u2014and it has the storytelling freedoms offered by high-concept science fiction, fantasy, and magical realism.\"<ref name=\"VultureAnalysis\" /> Pokaski revealed in August 2018 that he sent Riesman's article to Karey Burke and other executives on the series as encouragement for the direction they were planning to take the series, and to confirm that what they had released about the series did not sound \"like we were blowing smoke\".<ref name=\"VulturePokaskiAug2018\" />\n\n===Accolades===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width: 99%;\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Year\n! scope=\"col\"| Award\n! scope=\"col\"| Category\n! scope=\"col\"| Nominee(s)\n! scope=\"col\"| Result\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"| {{Abbr|Ref(s)|Reference(s)}}\n|-\n| rowspan=\"4\" | 2018\n| [[44th People's Choice Awards|People's Choice Awards]]\n| The Sci-Fi/Fantasy Show of 2018\n|''Cloak & Dagger''\n| {{Nominated}}\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.eonline.com/shows/peoples_choice_awards/news/963752/2018-people-s-choice-awards-complete-list-of-nominations|title=2018 People's Choice Awards: Complete List of Nominations|publisher=E!

As their friendship unfolds, they soon realize that their powers work better when they are together, they use these powers to try to fix some of the wrong in the world.\n\nIn season two, Tandy and Tyrone work to solve the abductions of women run by Andre Deschaine while dealing with Brigid O'Reilly's vigilante half [[Mayhem (comics)|Mayhem]].\n\n==Cast and characters==\n===Main===\n<!-- Order per the opening credits -->\n* [[Olivia Holt]] as [[Cloak and Dagger (comics)|Tandy Bowen / Dagger]]: <br />A teenager and street thief who is connected to Tyrone Johnson through a shared childhood tragedy,<ref name=\"/FilmSXSW\" /> with the ability to emit light daggers.<ref name=\"C&DCast\" /> Showrunner [[Joe Pokaski]] felt Bowen in the series was \"more cynical\" than previous portrayals, and noted that when she touches people she can access their hopes and desires, saying, \"There's something exciting about having a cynical character like Tandy who steals things and doesn't believe in the good of man, yet sees the best in them when she touches them\".<ref name=\"PokaskiTVLineJun2018\" /> Rachel Ryals portrays a young Tandy.<ref name=\"THRReview\" />\n* [[Aubrey Joseph]] as [[Cloak and Dagger (comics)|Tyrone Johnson / Cloak]]: <br />A teenager, who is connected to Tandy Bowen through a shared childhood tragedy, with the ability to engulf others in darkness and transport them through the [[Darkforce]] Dimension.<ref name=\"C&DCast\" /><ref name=\"/FilmSXSW\" /> Johnson has the ability to witness people's fears, having been \"living in a world of fear\" since the death of his older brother Billy.

The series, which would be set in post-[[Hurricane Katrina]] [[New Orleans]], would follow [[Cloak and Dagger (comics)|Cloak and Dagger]] as the two \"find each other and realize that their powers both complement and complicate their lives.\"<ref name=\"ABCFamilyDevelopment\" /> Around this time, Loeb had a meeting with ABC Family, who recommended [[Joe Pokaski]] to Loeb as a potential writer to work with Marvel Television, based on a script for another series the channel had recently received from Pokaski. Loeb reached out to Pokaski about working with Marvel, who was interested in writing Cloak and Dagger since \"there's something that felt so right about them for the television format\", and wrote the script. Pokaski was attracted to Cloak and Dagger as a television series, because the duo are the only people who understand each other's situations, compared to other coming-of-age teenage television series such as ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'' or ''[[Smallville]]'' where the main characters have no one who can relate to them.<ref name=\"VulturePokaskiAug2018\" />\n\nIn April 2016, the series received a straight-to-series order for [[Freeform (TV channel)|Freeform]], the new name of ABC Family, from [[ABC Studios#ABC Signature|ABC Signature Studios]] and Marvel Television.<ref name=\"SeriesOrder\" /> By August 2016, Pokaski had signed on to the series as showrunner and executive producer.<ref name=\"LoebGeekingOut\" /><ref name=\"Pokaski\" /><ref name=\"EPs\" /> Pokaski noted his script had \"sat in a drawer for five years\", before Freeform executive Karey Burke found it and \"took a chance on it\".<ref name=\"VulturePokaskiAug2018\" /> Loeb, Jim Chory,<ref name=\"LoebEP\" /><ref name=\"EPs\" /> [[Alan Fine (executive)|Alan Fine]], [[Stan Lee]], [[Joe Quesada]], and Karim Zreik also serve as executive producers, while Jenny Klein produces the series.<ref name=\"ScienceFictionCast\" /> On July 20, 2018, Freeform renewed the series for a 10-episode second season, which premiered on April 4, 2019.<ref name=\"S2Deadline\" /><ref name=\"CDS2Premiere\" /> The series was canceled on October 24, 2019.<ref name=\"CDCanceled\" />\n\n===Writing===\n{{quote box|width=33%|align=right|quote=... [I]t all starts with representation ... [W]e make sure our writers room is filled with as many people who do not look like me as possible.

It's not like we took something and made it into a [[Young adult fiction]]. It speaks to a YA audience and is a YA property. Would I do ''[[The Punisher (TV series)|Punisher]]'' on Freeform? I don't think that's going to connect the same way.\"<ref name=\"LoebAug2016\" /> Pokaski was pleased with the diversity of the writers for the first season, with a majority of black writers and many female writers.<ref name=\"PokaskiColliderJul2018\" /> The majority of the writers from the first season returned for the second. The second season would explore the themes of women's rights and issues through Mina Hess, while \"continuing to drive the conversation forward about race in America\".<ref name=\"THRS2Aug2018\" />\n\nPokaski spoke about the differences in Cloak and Dagger's origin story from the comics, saying, \"I think the original [comic] stories were fantastic, but for the time, while they were a little progressive, they were a little bit sexist and racist once you got into it, for now. What we tried to do was deconstruct it and make it about Tandy and Tyrone, understand who they were.\"<ref name=\"WonderCon\" /> Since the original comics \"are a little dated\", Pokaski and the writers could to make adjustments accordingly as Cloak and Dagger do not have an established comics mythology, making sure \"we were telling the right story for now\".<ref name=\"VulturePokaskiAug2018\" /> He also felt Loeb's idea of having the duo live in New Orleans, opposed to New York City as in the comics, was a \"great idea\".<ref name=\"WonderCon\" /> Since Marvel was also developing ''[[The Defenders (miniseries)|The Defenders]]'' at the same time, moving to the New Orleans setting \"came up pretty early\", since Pokaski felt New York City of the Marvel Cinematic Universe had enough superheroes. When looking for alternate locations, and considering places with filming [[tax incentive]]s, New Orleans \"felt so right for Tandy and Tyrone. It felt gothic, it felt a little bit dark, it felt like a place of light and shadow. The more we learned about the city and about its history and about [[voudon]] or the [[Mardi Gras Indians]], it felt like it was the only place for Tandy and Tyrone to start.\"<ref name=\"VulturePokaskiAug2018\" />\n\nPokaski did not want to rush the romantic relationship between the duo in the first season, and hoped the series would last long enough to allow for \"an interesting path to their relationship.\"<ref name=\"PokaskiTVLineJun2018\" /> Pokaski has an intent to create 100 episodes for the series, with \"a definitive plan for five season\" created.<ref name=\"PokaskiColliderJul2018\" />\n\n===Casting===\n[[File:Olivia Holt & Aubrey Joseph by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|[[Olivia Holt]] and [[Aubrey Joseph]] at [[WonderCon]] 2018 promoting ''Cloak & Dagger'']]\nIn January 2017, it was announced that [[Olivia Holt]] and [[Aubrey Joseph]] had been cast as Tandy Bowen / Dagger and Tyrone Johnson / Cloak, respectively.<ref name=\"C&DCast\" /> [[Gina Prince-Bythewood]], the director of the first episode, called the casting process \"really, really tough ... it was three days before we were supposed to leave [to begin filming] and we didn't find [actors for Tandy and Tyrone]. People started getting willing to settle and the people that were on the table were 27, 28. They felt grown and it didn't feel right for the show. Then Aubrey and Olivia walked in the door, and they had such great chops individually\".<ref name=\"WonderCon\" />\n\nThe following month, [[Andrea Roth]] was cast as [[Melissa Bowen]], Tandy's mother;<ref name=\"AdditionalCast\" /> [[Gloria Reuben]] and [[Miles Mussenden]] were cast as Tyrone's parents, [[Otis and Adina Johnson|Adina and Otis Johnson]];<ref name=\"AdditionalCast\" /><ref name=\"MussendenOtis\" /> and Carl Lundstedt and [[J.

Because of other commitments, she did not plan to continue with the series, and, along with Prince-Bythewood, recommended Cliff Charles to replace her, who served as cinematographer on the remaining episodes of season one.<ref name=\"DPsSeason1\" /> The first season features many [[hand-held camera]] shots that established the \"look and feel\" of the series, in part because Pokaski \"didn't want to wait for a [[Camera dolly|dolly track]] to be laid\".<ref name=\"PokaskiColliderJul2018\" />\n\n===Music===\n[[Mark Isham]] announced in May 2017 that he would compose the music for the series.<ref name=\"Isham\" /> Multiple songs are featured throughout the first season,<ref name=\"OtherMusic\" /> some of which were collected and released on a digital soundtrack album on June 8, 2018, by [[Marvel Music]] and [[Hollywood Records]].<ref name=\"Soundtrack\" /><ref name=\"Soundtrack2\" /> An album featuring Isham's score was released digitally on July 6.<ref name=\"ScoreAlbum\" />\n\n===Marvel Cinematic Universe tie-ins===\nFreeform executive Karey Burke said in April 2017 that the series is \"not particularly connected\" to ''[[New Warriors (TV series)|New Warriors]]'', which was slated to air on Freeform at the time, given \"their tones are so wildly different\", adding, \"There are many degrees of separation with where they fall in the Marvel universe. But anything is possible with Marvel.\"<ref name=\"NewWarriorsApril2017\" /> In July, Loeb said there were no plans to crossover, nor to crossover across networks with the similarly themed ''[[Runaways (TV series)|Runaways]]'' on [[Hulu]]. He added that Marvel wanted the series to find its footing before further connecting with other elements of the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]], saying \"You'll see things that comment on each other; we try to touch base wherever we can ... things that are happening in L.A. [where ''Runaways'' is set] are not exactly going to be affecting what's happening in New Orleans ... It's being aware of it and trying to find a way for it to be able to discuss in a way that makes sense.\"<ref name=\"TCAJul2017THR\" />\n\nAhead of the series premiere, considering the larger events of the MCU at that point, Pokaski said he was \"not allowed to talk about\" how the series would connect to the events of ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'' but stated \"We've had some exciting conversations about how we could artfully cross Tandy and Tyrone over [to other Marvel properties]. The beauty of these two is that they can show up anywhere [and it makes sense].\"<ref name=\"PokaskiTVLineJun2018\" /> After the first season finale, Pokaski expanded, saying he would \"love\" to have Tandy and Tyrone appear in the MCU films \"as utility players the way they are in comics\", but conceded \"there are a lot of legal hurdles and corporate barriers to doing that\". Regarding a crossover with the ''Runaways'', Pokaski noted \"there's hopefully there's some karma we can fulfill there\" since the duo in the comics appear early in the [[Runaways (comics)|''Runaways'' comic series]].<ref name=\"THRS2Aug2018\" />\n\nIn August 2019, it was announced that Holt and Joseph would appear in the third season of ''Runaways''.<ref name=\"S3Crossover\">{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2019/08/runaways-cloak-and-dagger-crossover-episode-marvel-plans-1202658705/|title=Marvel Sets 'Runaways' And 'Cloak & Dagger' Crossover Episode|work=Deadline Hollywood|first1=Geoff|last1=Boucher|first2=Patrick|last2=Hipes|date=August 1, 2019|accessdate=August 1, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\n''Cloak & Dagger'' airs in the United States on Freeform and on [[ABC Spark]] in Canada,<ref name=\"PremiereDate\" /><ref name=\"CanadaBroadcast\" /> while [[Amazon Video]] airs the series in the United Kingdom and select additional European countries.<ref name=\"EuroBroadcast\" />\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Ratings===\n{{Television season ratings\n| hide_rank         = y\n\n| link1             = Cloak & Dagger (season 1)\n| timeslot1         = Thursday 8:00 pm\n| timeslot_length1  = 2\n| episodes1         = 10\n| start1            = June 7, 2018\n| startrating1      = 0.919<ref name=\"101-102Ratings\"/><!-- defined by transclusion from Cloak & Dagger (season 1) -->\n| end1              = August 2, 2018\n| endrating1        = 0.423<ref name=\"110Ratings\"/><!-- defined by transclusion from Cloak & Dagger (season 1) -->\n| season1           = 2017\u201318\n| viewers1          = 0.572<ref name=\"S1RatingsAvg\">{{cite web|url=https://tvseriesfinale.com/tv-show/marvels-cloak-dagger-season-one-ratings/|title=Marvel's Cloak & Dagger: Season One Ratings|website=TV Series Finale|date=August 3, 2018|accessdate=April 21, 2019|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20190421210233/https://tvseriesfinale.com/tv-show/marvels-cloak-dagger-season-one-ratings/|archivedate=April 21, 2019}}</ref>\n| 18_49_rating1     = 0.20<ref name=\"S1RatingsAvg\" />\n\n| link2             = Cloak & Dagger (season 2)\n| episodes2         = 10\n| start2            = April 4, 2019\n| startrating2      = 0.477<ref name=\"201-202Ratings\"/><!-- defined by transclusion from Cloak & Dagger (season 2) -->\n| end2              = May 30, 2019\n| endrating2        = 0.346<ref name=\"210Ratings\" /><!-- defined by transclusion from Cloak & Dagger (season 2) -->\n| season2           = 2018\u201319\n| viewers2          = \n| 18_49_rating2     = \n}}\n\n''Cloak & Dagger'' had the best series launch on Freeform in two years and Freeform's most-watched drama since \"[[Till Death Do Us Part (Pretty Little Liars)|Till Death Do Us Part]]\", the series finale of ''[[Pretty Little Liars]]'' in June 2017.

It should not be confused with the bacterial tick-borne infection, [[Rocky Mountain spotted fever]].\n\nThe [[type (biology)|type]] [[species]] of the [[genus]] ''[[Coltivirus]]'', Colorado tick fever virus (CTFV) infects haemopoietic cells, particularly [[erythrocyte]]s, which explains how the virus is transmitted by ticks and also accounts for the incidence of transmission by blood transfusion.\n\n==Signs and symptoms==\nFirst signs or symptoms can occur about three to six days after the initial tick bite, although it can have incubation periods of up to 20 days.  Patients usually experience a two-staged fever and illness which can continue for three days, diminish, and then return for another episode of one to three days.  The virus has the ability to live in the blood stream for up to 120 days; therefore, coming in contact without proper precautions and the donation of blood are prohibited.\n\nInitial symptoms include fever, chills, headaches, pain behind the eyes, light sensitivity, muscle pain, generalized malaise, abdominal pain, hepatosplenomegaly, nausea and vomiting, and a flat or pimply rash.<ref name=\"urlColorado Tick Fever\"/>  During the second phase of the virus, a high fever can return with an increase in symptoms. CTF can be very severe in cases involving children and can even require hospitalization.  Complications with this disease have included aseptic meningitis, encephalitis, and hemorrhagic fever, but these are rare.\n\nCTF is seasonal, mostly occurring in the Rocky Mountain region of the United States and usually in altitudes from 4,000 to 10,000 feet (1.600 to 3.000 meters).<ref name=\"urlColorado Tick Fever\"/>  Patients with CTF are mostly campers and young males, who most likely have been bitten because of their <!-- occupational --> activities.\n\n==Cause==\n===Virology===\n{{Taxobox\n| color              = violet\n| name               = Colorado tick fever virus\n| virus_group        = iii     \n| ordo               = ''Unassigned''     \n| familia            = ''[[Reoviridae]]''\n| subfamilia         = ''[[Spinareovirinae]]''\n| genus              = ''[[Coltivirus]]''\n| species            = '''''Colorado tick fever virus'''''\n}}\nThe virus particle, like other coltiviruses, is about 80&nbsp;nm in diameter and is generally not enveloped.  The double-stranded RNA viral genome is about 20,000 bp long and is divided into 12 segments, which are termed Seg-1 to Seg-12.  Viral replication in infected cells is associated with characteristic cytoplasmic granular matrices.  Evidence suggests viral presence in mature erythrocytes is a result of replication of the virus in hematopoitic erythrocyte precursor cells and simultaneous maturation of the infected immature cells rather than of direct entry and replication of CTFV in mature erythrocytes.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Philipp CS, Callaway C, Chu MC |title=Replication of Colorado tick fever virus within human hematopoietic progenitor cells |journal=J.

If for some reason the tick is not able to find a host before the winter, it will stay under groundcover until spring, when it can resume its search.  The wood tick does not typically seek hosts in the hottest summer months.  Adult ticks tend to climb to the tops of grasses or low shrubs, attaching themselves to a host wandering by. They secure the attachment by secreting a cement-like substance from their mouths, inserting it into the host.<ref name=\"urlRocky Mountain wood tick: Information from Answers.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.answers.com/topic/rocky-mountain-wood-tick |title=Rocky Mountain wood tick: Information from Answers.com |format= |website= |accessdate=2009-01-20}}{{unreliable source?|date=August 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Transmission===\nColorado tick fever is acquired by tick bite. No evidence of natural person-to-person transmission has been found. However, rare cases of transmission from [[blood transfusion]]s have been reported. The virus which causes Colorado tick fever may stay in the blood for as long as four months after onset of the illness.\n\n==Diagnosis==\nA combination  of clinical signs, symptoms, and laboratory tests can confirm the likelihood of having CTF.  Some tests include complement fixation to Colorado tick virus, immunofluorescence for Colorado tick fever, and some other common laboratory findings suggestive of CTF, including leucopenia, thrombocytopenia, and mildly elevated liver enzyme levels.\n\nDetection of viral antibodies on red blood cells is possible.<ref name=\"pmid\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Mohd Jaafar F, Attoui H, Gallian P |title=Recombinant VP7-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for detection of immunoglobulin G antibodies to Colorado tick fever virus |journal=J.

Wear a long sleeved shirt, hat, long pants, and tuck pant legs into socks.\n*Walk in the center of trails to avoid overhanging grass and brush.\n*Clothing and body parts should be checked every few hours for ticks when spending time outdoors in tick-infested areas. Ticks are most often found on the thigh, arms, underarms, and legs. Ticks can be very small (no bigger than a pinhead). Look carefully for new \"freckles\".\n*The use of [[insect repellent]]s containing [[DEET]] on skin or [[permethrin]] on clothing can be effective. Follow the directions on the container and wash off repellents when going indoors.\n*Remove attached ticks immediately.\n\nContracting the CTF virus is thought to provide long-lasting immunity against reinfection.  However, it is always wise to be on the safe side and try to prevent tick bites.<ref name=\"urlColorado Tick Fever\"/>\n\n==Treatment==\nNo specific treatment for CTF is yet available.  The first action is make sure the tick is fully removed from the skin, then acetaminophen and analgesics can be used to help relieve the fever and pain.  Aspirin is not recommended for children, as it has been linked to Reye\u2019s syndrome in some viral illnesses.   Salicylates should not be used because of [[thrombocytopenia]], and the rare occurrence of bleeding disorders.  People who suspect they have been bitten by a tick or are starting to show signs of CTF should contact their physicians immediately.<ref name=\"urlMedical Encyclopedia: Colorado tick fever\" />\n\n===Tick removal===\nTicks should be removed promptly and carefully with tweezers and by applying gentle, steady traction. The tick's body should not be crushed when it is removed and the tweezers should be placed as close to the skin as possible to avoid leaving tick mouthparts in the skin. Mouthparts left in the skin can allow secondary infections. Ticks should not be removed with bare hands. Hands should be protected by gloves or tissues and thoroughly washed with soap and water after the removal process.\n\nA match or flame should not be used to remove a tick. This method, once thought safe, can cause the tick to regurgitate expelling any disease it may be carrying into the bite wound.<ref name=\"urlThe Claim: Remove a Tick From Your Skin by Burning It\u2014New York Times\">{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/05/science/05real.html?_r=1&oref=slogin |title=The Claim: Remove a Tick From Your Skin by Burning It |format= |work= The New York Times|accessdate=2009-01-20 | first=Anahad | last=O'Connor | date=2005-07-05}}</ref>\n\n==Epidemiology==\nThe disease develops from March to September, with the highest infections occurring in June.<ref name=\"urlMedical Encyclopedia: Colorado tick fever\">{{cite web |url=https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000675.htm |title=Colorado tick fever|website= |accessdate=2017-07-10|publisher=MedlinePlus}}</ref> The disease is found almost exclusively in the western United States and Canada, mostly in high mountain areas such as Colorado and Idaho.

If for some reason the tick is not able to find a host before the winter, it will stay under groundcover until spring, when it can resume its search.  The wood tick does not typically seek hosts in the hottest summer months.  Adult ticks tend to climb to the tops of grasses or low shrubs, attaching themselves to a host wandering by. They secure the attachment by secreting a cement-like substance from their mouths, inserting it into the host.<ref name=\"urlRocky Mountain wood tick: Information from Answers.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.answers.com/topic/rocky-mountain-wood-tick |title=Rocky Mountain wood tick: Information from Answers.com |format= |website= |accessdate=2009-01-20}}{{unreliable source?|date=August 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Transmission===\nColorado tick fever is acquired by tick bite. No evidence of natural person-to-person transmission has been found. However, rare cases of transmission from [[blood transfusion]]s have been reported. The virus which causes Colorado tick fever may stay in the blood for as long as four months after onset of the illness.\n\n==Diagnosis==\nA combination  of clinical signs, symptoms, and laboratory tests can confirm the likelihood of having CTF.

Wear a long sleeved shirt, hat, long pants, and tuck pant legs into socks.\n*Walk in the center of trails to avoid overhanging grass and brush.\n*Clothing and body parts should be checked every few hours for ticks when spending time outdoors in tick-infested areas. Ticks are most often found on the thigh, arms, underarms, and legs. Ticks can be very small (no bigger than a pinhead). Look carefully for new \"freckles\".\n*The use of [[insect repellent]]s containing [[DEET]] on skin or [[permethrin]] on clothing can be effective. Follow the directions on the container and wash off repellents when going indoors.\n*Remove attached ticks immediately.\n\nContracting the CTF virus is thought to provide long-lasting immunity against reinfection.  However, it is always wise to be on the safe side and try to prevent tick bites.<ref name=\"urlColorado Tick Fever\"/>\n\n==Treatment==\nNo specific treatment for CTF is yet available.  The first action is make sure the tick is fully removed from the skin, then acetaminophen and analgesics can be used to help relieve the fever and pain.  Aspirin is not recommended for children, as it has been linked to Reye\u2019s syndrome in some viral illnesses.   Salicylates should not be used because of [[thrombocytopenia]], and the rare occurrence of bleeding disorders.  People who suspect they have been bitten by a tick or are starting to show signs of CTF should contact their physicians immediately.<ref name=\"urlMedical Encyclopedia: Colorado tick fever\" />\n\n===Tick removal===\nTicks should be removed promptly and carefully with tweezers and by applying gentle, steady traction. The tick's body should not be crushed when it is removed and the tweezers should be placed as close to the skin as possible to avoid leaving tick mouthparts in the skin. Mouthparts left in the skin can allow secondary infections. Ticks should not be removed with bare hands. Hands should be protected by gloves or tissues and thoroughly washed with soap and water after the removal process.\n\nA match or flame should not be used to remove a tick. This method, once thought safe, can cause the tick to regurgitate expelling any disease it may be carrying into the bite wound.<ref name=\"urlThe Claim: Remove a Tick From Your Skin by Burning It\u2014New York Times\">{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/05/science/05real.html?_r=1&oref=slogin |title=The Claim: Remove a Tick From Your Skin by Burning It |format= |work= The New York Times|accessdate=2009-01-20 | first=Anahad | last=O'Connor | date=2005-07-05}}</ref>\n\n==Epidemiology==\nThe disease develops from March to September, with the highest infections occurring in June.<ref name=\"urlMedical Encyclopedia: Colorado tick fever\">{{cite web |url=https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000675.htm |title=Colorado tick fever|website= |accessdate=2017-07-10|publisher=MedlinePlus}}</ref> The disease is found almost exclusively in the western United States and Canada, mostly in high mountain areas such as Colorado and Idaho.

However, researchers at [[Oxford University]] have found that certain specific parts of the brain were injured in some foreign accent syndrome cases, indicating that particular parts of the brain control various [[Language|linguistic]] functions, and damage could result in altered pitch and/or mispronounced [[syllable]]s, causing speech patterns to be distorted in a non-specific manner.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} Contrary to popular beliefs that individuals with FAS exhibit their accent without any effort, these individuals feel as if they are suffering from a speech disorder.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Miller|first=Nick|author2=Jill Taylor |author3=Chloe Howe |author4=Jennifer Read |title=Living with foreign accent syndrome: Insider perspectives|journal=Aphasiology|date=September 2011|volume=25|issue=9|pages=1053\u20131068|url=http://journals1.scholarsportal.info/show_html.xqy?uri=/02687038/v25i0009/1053_lwfasip.xml&school=toronto|accessdate=9 December 2012 |doi=10.1080/02687038.2011.573857}}</ref> More recently, there is mounting evidence that the [[cerebellum]], which controls motor function, may be crucially involved in some cases of foreign accent syndrome, reinforcing the notion that speech pattern alteration is mechanical, and thus non-specific.<ref>Mari\u00ebn P., Verhoeven J., Engelborghs, S., Rooker, S., Pickut, B.

FAS mainly affects speech at a segmental or [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosodic]] level. Vowels are more likely to be affected than consonants. Vowel errors include an increase in vowel tensing, monophthongization of [[diphthong]]s, and vowel fronting and raising. There is evidence of both vowel shortening and lengthening. Consonantal anomalies include cases of changes in articulation, manner, and voicing.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=van der Scheer|first=Fennetta|last2=Jonkers|first2=Roel|last3=Gilbers|first3=Dicky|date=2013-12-18|title=Foreign accent syndrome and force of articulation|journal=Aphasiology|volume=28|issue=4|pages=471\u2013489|doi=10.1080/02687038.2013.866210|issn=0268-7038|hdl=11370/abd6e99a-586d-4f6f-acad-3392c800d119}}</ref> On a suprasegmental level, there are changes in [[Intonation (linguistics)|intonation]] and pitch, such as monotonous intonation or exaggerations in pitch height and range.

Some researchers think that FAS is a mild form of AoS because they are both caused by similar [[lesion]]s in the brain. However, FAS differs from AoS in that FAS patients have more control over their speech deficits and their \u201cforeign accent\u201d is a form of compensation for their speech problems. Because there are relatively few differences in the symptoms of FAS and AoS, a listeners\u2019 perception of the affected speech plays a large role in diagnosis of FAS rather than AoS. The listener has to be familiar with a foreign accent in order to attribute it to the affected speech of someone with FAS.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe perception of a foreign accent is likely to be a case of [[pareidolia]] on the part of the listener. Nick Miller, Professor of Motor Speech Disorders at [[Newcastle University]] has explained: \"The notion that sufferers speak in a foreign language is something that is in the ear of the listener, rather than the mouth of the speaker. It is simply that the rhythm and pronunciation of speech has changed.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/features/unusual-illnesses-curiouser-and-curiouser-2084669.html |title=Unusual illnesses: Curiouser and curiouser |work=The Independent |date=21 September 2010 |accessdate=2 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nDeceased British singer [[George Michael]] claimed that, after waking from a three-week long [[coma]] in 2012, he temporarily had a [[West Country English|West Country accent]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/music-news/9407826/George-Michael-I-woke-up-from-coma-with-a-West-Country-accent.html|title=George Michael: I woke up from coma with a West Country accent|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|date=18 July 2012|accessdate=17 December 2012|location=London}}</ref>\n\n== Causes and Diagnosis ==\nIn a meta-analysis of 112 patients with FAS, 97% were adults, and 67% were female.

Of the patients with neurological damage, the majority had a lesion in the supratentorial left hemisphere. Lesions primarily affected the [[premotor cortex]], [[motor cortex]], [[basal ganglia]] or [[Broca's area|Broca\u2019s area]]. Lesions are also seen in the [[cerebellum]], which projects to the previous areas. Right hemisphere damage rarely causes FAS. The majority of patients with FAS usually present other speech disorders as well, such as [[Muteness|mutism]], [[aphasia]], [[dysarthria]], [[agrammatism]], and [[apraxia of speech]].<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nH. Whitaker first coined the term Foreign Accent Syndrome in 1982. He originally proposed some criteria that must be present in order to diagnose someone with FAS; they must be monolingual, they must have damage to their central nervous system that affects their speech, and their speech must be perceived as subjectively sounding foreign by themselves or clinicians. One problem with Whitaker\u2019s criteria is that they are based primarily on subjectivity, and therefore acoustic phonetic measurements are rarely used to diagnose FAS.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nSince this syndrome is very rare, it takes a multidisciplinary team to evaluate the syndrome and diagnose it, including [[Speech-language pathology|speech-language pathologists]], [[neurolinguists]], [[Neurology|neurologists]], [[Neuropsychology|neuropsychologists]], and [[Psychology|psychologists]].<ref name=\"Lukas-MtSinai-Web\">{{cite web | url=http://www.mountsinai.org/patient-care/health-library/diseases-and-conditions/foreign-accent-syndrome | title=Foreign Accent Syndrome | publisher=EBSCO Publishing | date=March 2014 | accessdate=15 July 2014 | last=Lukas | first=Rimas}}</ref> In 2010, Verhoeven and Mari\u00ebn <ref>{{cite book|last1=Verhoeven|first1=Jo|last2=Mari\u00ebn|first2=Peter|chapter=Suprasegmental aspects of Foreign Accent Syndrome|title=Speech Prosody in Atypical Populations.

However, in order to find out what subtype the patient is suffering from, complementary investigations are necessary. This differentiation is necessary for the clinician to allow for correct therapeutic guidance.  Psychological evaluations may be performed in order to rule out any psychiatric condition that may be causing the change in speech, as well as tests to assess reading, writing, and language comprehension in order to identify comorbid disorders often co-occurring with the disorder.<ref name=\"Lukas-MtSinai-Web\" /> One of the symptoms of this syndrome is that the patient moves their tongue or jaw differently while speaking, which creates a different sound, so a recording is done of the speech pattern in order to analyze it. Often images of the brain are taken with either [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]], [[X-ray computed tomography|CT]], [[Single-photon emission computed tomography|SPECT]]<ref name=\"journal.frontiersin.org\" /> or [[Positron emission tomography|PET]] scans.<ref name=\"Lukas-MtSinai-Web\" /> This is done in order to see if there is structural and or functional damage in the areas of the brain that control speech and/or rhythm and melody of speech. [[Electroencephalography|EEG]] is sometimes performed to investigate whether there are disturbances at the electrophysiological level.<ref name=\"Lukas-MtSinai-Web\" />\n\nTreatment involves intense speech therapy. Methods such as oromotor exercises, using mirrors, targeting phonetic awareness, reading lists and texts, and using [[electropalatography]] are all methods that have been used in the past. Treatment should be developed on a patient by patient basis. About a quarter of FAS patients go through remission after treatment.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nAdditional research on psychogenic FAS has been done, which can help outline some symptoms or commonalities among FAS patients. The findings include the following: 1) it is more common in women than men.

show ''[[Scream Queens (2015 TV series)|Scream Queens]]'', a female patient has the syndrome which then becomes very contagious to one of the three major characters in the show.{{citation

Likewise, there are not very many proposed treatments. Two that may provide relief to patients with FAS in the future include mastery of musical skills and \u201ctongue reading\u201d.<ref name=\"Moreno-Torres 639\"/>\n\nIn terms of mastery of music skills, research by Christiner and Reiterer suggests that musicians, both instrumental and vocal, are better at imitating foreign accents that non-musicians. Vocalists are further better than instrumentalists at this task. In this way, individuals with FAS might be able to reimmitate their original, lost native accents more easily if they master a music - especially vocal \u2013 skill.<ref name=\"Moreno-Torres 639\"/>\n\nPursuing this further, another set of researchers, Banks et al. investigated the role of hearing a foreign accent versus hearing and seeing someone use a foreign accent and which of these may be better for helping an individual replicate a foreign accent. Contrary to the researcher\u2019s predictions, \u201cno differences were found in perceptual gains between the two modalities.\u201d By contrast, a method that did seem to improve learning of non-native speech sounds was \u201creal-time visual feedback of tongue movements with an interactive 3D visualization system based on electromagnetic articulography.\u201d Hopefully, this visual representation of a patient\u2019s motor movements while producing speech can help patients with FAS become salient of the movement patterns required of their original accent.<ref name=\"Moreno-Torres 639\"/>\n\n== Cases of FAS ==\nTable #1: Cases from developmental FAS (DFAS), Psychogenic FAS (PFAS) and a New Variant of Neurologic FAS<ref name=\"Moreno-Torres 639\"/>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|'''Subtype'''\n|'''Case''' '''Descriptions'''\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |DFAS\n|An  adolescent male without family history of developmental disorders or personal  psychiatric issues.

FAS mainly affects speech at a segmental or [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosodic]] level. Vowels are more likely to be affected than consonants. Vowel errors include an increase in vowel tensing, monophthongization of [[diphthong]]s, and vowel fronting and raising. There is evidence of both vowel shortening and lengthening. Consonantal anomalies include cases of changes in articulation, manner, and voicing.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=van der Scheer|first=Fennetta|last2=Jonkers|first2=Roel|last3=Gilbers|first3=Dicky|date=2013-12-18|title=Foreign accent syndrome and force of articulation|journal=Aphasiology|volume=28|issue=4|pages=471\u2013489|doi=10.1080/02687038.2013.866210|issn=0268-7038|hdl=11370/abd6e99a-586d-4f6f-acad-3392c800d119}}</ref> On a suprasegmental level, there are changes in [[Intonation (linguistics)|intonation]] and pitch, such as monotonous intonation or exaggerations in pitch height and range.

This perception could be due to changes in syllable durations, and the addition of [[Epenthesis|epenthetic]] vowels.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nFAS has many similarities to [[apraxia of speech]] (AoS), which is another motor speech disorder. Some researchers think that FAS is a mild form of AoS because they are both caused by similar [[lesion]]s in the brain. However, FAS differs from AoS in that FAS patients have more control over their speech deficits and their \u201cforeign accent\u201d is a form of compensation for their speech problems. Because there are relatively few differences in the symptoms of FAS and AoS, a listeners\u2019 perception of the affected speech plays a large role in diagnosis of FAS rather than AoS. The listener has to be familiar with a foreign accent in order to attribute it to the affected speech of someone with FAS.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe perception of a foreign accent is likely to be a case of [[pareidolia]] on the part of the listener. Nick Miller, Professor of Motor Speech Disorders at [[Newcastle University]] has explained: \"The notion that sufferers speak in a foreign language is something that is in the ear of the listener, rather than the mouth of the speaker. It is simply that the rhythm and pronunciation of speech has changed.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/features/unusual-illnesses-curiouser-and-curiouser-2084669.html |title=Unusual illnesses: Curiouser and curiouser |work=The Independent |date=21 September 2010 |accessdate=2 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nDeceased British singer [[George Michael]] claimed that, after waking from a three-week long [[coma]] in 2012, he temporarily had a [[West Country English|West Country accent]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/music-news/9407826/George-Michael-I-woke-up-from-coma-with-a-West-Country-accent.html|title=George Michael: I woke up from coma with a West Country accent|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|date=18 July 2012|accessdate=17 December 2012|location=London}}</ref>\n\n== Causes and Diagnosis ==\nIn a meta-analysis of 112 patients with FAS, 97% were adults, and 67% were female.

In cases where [[handedness]] was recorded, the majority of patients were right-handed. Only in 12.5% of the cases did the patients have previous exposure to the accent that they later seemed to developed due to FAS.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Mari\u00ebn|first=Peter|last2=Keulen|first2=Stefanie|last3=Verhoeven|first3=Jo|date=January 2019|title=Neurological Aspects of Foreign Accent Syndrome in Stroke Patients|journal=Journal of Communication Disorders|volume=77|pages=94\u2013113|doi=10.1016/j.jcomdis.2018.12.002|pmid=30606457|issn=0021-9924}}</ref>\n\nThe majority of FAS patients develop FAS due to a stroke, but some are due to developmental or psychological disorders, or due to trauma or tumors. Of the patients with neurological damage, the majority had a lesion in the supratentorial left hemisphere. Lesions primarily affected the [[premotor cortex]], [[motor cortex]], [[basal ganglia]] or [[Broca's area|Broca\u2019s area]]. Lesions are also seen in the [[cerebellum]], which projects to the previous areas. Right hemisphere damage rarely causes FAS. The majority of patients with FAS usually present other speech disorders as well, such as [[Muteness|mutism]], [[aphasia]], [[dysarthria]], [[agrammatism]], and [[apraxia of speech]].<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nH. Whitaker first coined the term Foreign Accent Syndrome in 1982. He originally proposed some criteria that must be present in order to diagnose someone with FAS; they must be monolingual, they must have damage to their central nervous system that affects their speech, and their speech must be perceived as subjectively sounding foreign by themselves or clinicians. One problem with Whitaker\u2019s criteria is that they are based primarily on subjectivity, and therefore acoustic phonetic measurements are rarely used to diagnose FAS.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nSince this syndrome is very rare, it takes a multidisciplinary team to evaluate the syndrome and diagnose it, including [[Speech-language pathology|speech-language pathologists]], [[neurolinguists]], [[Neurology|neurologists]], [[Neuropsychology|neuropsychologists]], and [[Psychology|psychologists]].<ref name=\"Lukas-MtSinai-Web\">{{cite web | url=http://www.mountsinai.org/patient-care/health-library/diseases-and-conditions/foreign-accent-syndrome | title=Foreign Accent Syndrome | publisher=EBSCO Publishing | date=March 2014 | accessdate=15 July 2014 | last=Lukas | first=Rimas}}</ref> In 2010, Verhoeven and Mari\u00ebn <ref>{{cite book|last1=Verhoeven|first1=Jo|last2=Mari\u00ebn|first2=Peter|chapter=Suprasegmental aspects of Foreign Accent Syndrome|title=Speech Prosody in Atypical Populations.

However, in order to find out what subtype the patient is suffering from, complementary investigations are necessary. This differentiation is necessary for the clinician to allow for correct therapeutic guidance.  Psychological evaluations may be performed in order to rule out any psychiatric condition that may be causing the change in speech, as well as tests to assess reading, writing, and language comprehension in order to identify comorbid disorders often co-occurring with the disorder.<ref name=\"Lukas-MtSinai-Web\" /> One of the symptoms of this syndrome is that the patient moves their tongue or jaw differently while speaking, which creates a different sound, so a recording is done of the speech pattern in order to analyze it. Often images of the brain are taken with either [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]], [[X-ray computed tomography|CT]], [[Single-photon emission computed tomography|SPECT]]<ref name=\"journal.frontiersin.org\" /> or [[Positron emission tomography|PET]] scans.<ref name=\"Lukas-MtSinai-Web\" /> This is done in order to see if there is structural and or functional damage in the areas of the brain that control speech and/or rhythm and melody of speech. [[Electroencephalography|EEG]] is sometimes performed to investigate whether there are disturbances at the electrophysiological level.<ref name=\"Lukas-MtSinai-Web\" />\n\nTreatment involves intense speech therapy. Methods such as oromotor exercises, using mirrors, targeting phonetic awareness, reading lists and texts, and using [[electropalatography]] are all methods that have been used in the past. Treatment should be developed on a patient by patient basis. About a quarter of FAS patients go through remission after treatment.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nAdditional research on psychogenic FAS has been done, which can help outline some symptoms or commonalities among FAS patients. The findings include the following: 1) it is more common in women than men. The typical age range FAS is found in also renders the patient more prone to depression or mental issues (25\u201349 years). 2) it affects prosody such that intonation (pitch) becomes abnormal and speech is slowed 3) In terms of phones, vowels are more affected than consonants 4) Remission seemed to be related to the relieving of a patient\u2019s positive psychiatric symptoms that are comorbid with FAS.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Keulen|first=Stefanie|last2=Verhoeven|first2=Jo|last3=De Witte|first3=Elke|last4=De Page|first4=Louis|last5=Bastiaanse|first5=Roelien|last6=Mari\u00ebn|first6=Peter|date=2016-04-27|title=Foreign Accent Syndrome As a Psychogenic Disorder: A Review|journal=Frontiers in Human Neuroscience|volume=10|doi=10.3389/fnhum.2016.00168|issn=1662-5161|pmc=4846654|pmid=27199699}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe condition was first described in 1907 by the French neurologist [[Pierre Marie]],<ref name=\"mariep\" /> and another early case was reported in a [[Czech people|Czech]] study in 1919, conducted by German [[Internal medicine|internist]] {{ill|Alois Pick|de}} (1859&ndash;1945).<ref>Pick, A. 1919. \u00dcber \u00c4nderungen des Sprachcharakters als Begleiterscheinung aphasicher St\u00f6rungen.

Likewise, there are not very many proposed treatments. Two that may provide relief to patients with FAS in the future include mastery of musical skills and \u201ctongue reading\u201d.<ref name=\"Moreno-Torres 639\"/>\n\nIn terms of mastery of music skills, research by Christiner and Reiterer suggests that musicians, both instrumental and vocal, are better at imitating foreign accents that non-musicians. Vocalists are further better than instrumentalists at this task. In this way, individuals with FAS might be able to reimmitate their original, lost native accents more easily if they master a music - especially vocal \u2013 skill.<ref name=\"Moreno-Torres 639\"/>\n\nPursuing this further, another set of researchers, Banks et al. investigated the role of hearing a foreign accent versus hearing and seeing someone use a foreign accent and which of these may be better for helping an individual replicate a foreign accent. Contrary to the researcher\u2019s predictions, \u201cno differences were found in perceptual gains between the two modalities.\u201d By contrast, a method that did seem to improve learning of non-native speech sounds was \u201creal-time visual feedback of tongue movements with an interactive 3D visualization system based on electromagnetic articulography.\u201d Hopefully, this visual representation of a patient\u2019s motor movements while producing speech can help patients with FAS become salient of the movement patterns required of their original accent.<ref name=\"Moreno-Torres 639\"/>\n\n== Cases of FAS ==\nTable #1: Cases from developmental FAS (DFAS), Psychogenic FAS (PFAS) and a New Variant of Neurologic FAS<ref name=\"Moreno-Torres 639\"/>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|'''Subtype'''\n|'''Case''' '''Descriptions'''\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |DFAS\n|An  adolescent male without family history of developmental disorders or personal  psychiatric issues.

The dress set a record in 2006 when it was auctioned for \u00a3410,000, six times its original estimate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hellomagazine.com/celebrities/2006/12/06/audrey-hepburn-dress/ |title=Audrey Hepburn's Little Black Dress Sells for a Fortune |work=Hellomagazine.com |date=2006-12-06 |accessdate=2013-07-13}}</ref>\n\n[[Betty Boop]], a cartoon character based in part on the 1920s \"[[it girl]]\" [[Clara Bow]], was drawn wearing a little black dress in her early films, though with [[Technicolor]] later, Betty's dress became red.<ref name=\"Edelman, Amy Holman (1998).
