It gets no syndication fees from its syndicater GCN, no cut of the advertising that GCN sells, and it does not sell its three minutes per hour of national advertising time.

It gets no syndication fees from its syndicater GCN, no cut of the advertising that GCN sells, and it does not sell its three minutes per hour of national advertising time.

He was the only child of Emperor [[John III Doukas Vatatzes]] and [[Irene Lascarina]], the daughter of [[Theodore I Laskaris]] who had established Nicaea after the Byzantine capital, Constantinople, was captured by the crusaders of the [[Fourth Crusade]] in 1204. Theodore received excellent education from two renowned scholars, [[Nicephorus Blemmydes]] and [[George Akropolites]]. He made friends with young intelectuals, especially with a page of low birth, [[George Mouzalon]]. Theodore started to write treatises on theological, historical and philosophical themes in his youth. \n\nEmperor John&nbsp;III arranged Theodore's marriage with [[Elena Asenina of Bulgaria|Elena of Bulgaria]] to forge an alliance with her father, [[Ivan Asen II of Bulgaria|Ivan Asen&nbsp;II]] in 1235. Their marriage was happy and they had at least five children. Theodore acted as his father's lieutenant in [[Asia Minor]] during his father's campaigns in the [[Balkan Peninsula]] from 1241. He became his father's co-ruler around 1242, but he was not crowned co-emperor. His relationship with [[Theodore Philes]], [[Michael VIII Palaiologos|Michael Palaiologos]] and other aristocrats became tense during this period.\n\nTheodore succeeded his father on 4 November 1254. He dismissed many high officials and army commanders of aristocratic origin, replacing them with his commoner confidants. He made a deffensive alliance with [[Kaykaus II]], the [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuk]] [[Sultanate of Rum|Sultan of Rum]], against the [[Mongol Empire]]. He repelled a Bulgarian invasion of Thrace and Macedonia and forced [[Michael II Komnenos Doukas]], the ruler of [[Despotate of Epirus|Epirus]] to cede [[Dyrrachium]] on the coast of the [[Adriatic Sea]] to Nicaea. He introduced a military reform, recruiting more soldiers from among the native peasantry of Asia Minor. Michael&nbsp;II of Epiros forged an alliance with [[Stefan Uro\u0161 I]], [[King of Serbia]], and [[Manfred of Sicily]] and Theodore's newly appointed generals could not resist their joint invasion in 1257. Theodore fell seriously ill and could rarely take part in state administration during the last months of his life. He appointed George Mouzalon [[regent]] for his underage son, [[John IV Laskaris|John&nbsp;IV]] before he died of chronic [[epilepsy]] or cancer. In ten days, Mouzalon fell victim to an aristocratic plot and Michael Palaiologos assumed regency. \n\n==Early life==\n\n===Childhood===\n\n{{See also|Laskaris|Vatatzes}}\n\nTheodore was born to Emperor [[John III Doukas Vatatzes]] and [[Irene Lascarina]] in the imperial palace in [[Nicaea]] in late 1221 or early 1222.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|p=57}} Irene was the eldest daughter of [[Theodore I Laskaris]], the founder of the [[Empire of Nicaea]].{{sfn|Angelov|2019|p=57}} Nicaea was a successor state of the [[Byzantine Empire]], established after the crusaders (or Latins) [[Sack of Constantinople|captured Constantinople]]  during the [[Fourth Crusade]] in 1204.{{sfn|Nicol|1993|pp=10\u201311}} Vatatzes was Irene's third husband. He was born into a Byzantine aristocratic family related to the imperial [[Komnenos]] and [[Angelos]] dynasties. When he wed Irene, he served as the commander of the [[Vestiaritai|imperial guard]]. Although Irene's two brothers had died prematurely, Theodore&nbsp;I did not name Vatatzes as his official heir. He most likely expected that his third wife, the Latin [[Maria of Courtenay]], would bear sons, but he did not father children with her.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=32\u201334}} Theodore&nbsp;I died in November 1221. Vatatzes had to defeat the late emperor's brothers, Alexios and Isaac Laskaris, to seize the throne. His victory over his wife's uncles and their Latin allies in the [[Battle of Poimanenon]] in the winter of 1223\u20131224 opened the way to the reconquest of Byzantine territories lost to the Latins in [[Asia Minor]].{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=57\u201359}}\n\nTheodore was his parents' only child. His mother suffered a horse accident and could not bear children after his birth. He adopted his mother's family name.{{sfn|Treadgold|1997|p=721}}  He was \"raised as usual for a royal child\", according to his own words, most probably referring to his unbringing in the women's quarter of the palace and the luxory surrounding him. His childhood was joyful and he \"often received greatest solace\" from his father. He also remembered that his parents did not punish him when his tutor had accused him of misdemeanors.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=59\u201360, 257 (notes 21\u201322)}}\n\n===Education===\n\n[[File:Nicaea's Byzantine fortifications, Iznik, Turkey (37799778844).jpg|thumb|right|alt=Ruins of stone walls.|Ruins of the walls of Nicaea.]]\n\nIf Theodore's formal education started at the age when most other aristocratic children were taught to write and read, he was entrusted to an elementary teacher's care in 1228.  He had to pray three times a day and to memorize texts from the Bible. He could quote from the [[psalms]] and the [[parables of Jesus]] by heart till the end of his life.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=64\u201366}} Theodore's secondary education started around 1230. He detested his principal tutor (or ''[[baioulos]]'') and described him as a \"great babbler\" in his works, without mentioning his name. He studied grammar (that is [[Attic Greek]]), poetry, rhetoric, logic, mathematics, astronomy, geometry and music for three years. His grammatical studies raised his lifelong interest in words with multiple meaning and in [[Etymology|etymologies]]. The young Theodore was captivated by the orations of [[Demosthenes]] and [[Hermogenes of Tarsus]]. He also highly esteemed the theologian [[Gregory of Nazianzus]]. His tutor mocked him for \"philosophizing\" and urged Theodore to spend more time with military and diplomatic studies. Theodore was a passionate hunter and [[polo]] player with remarkable riding skills.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=68\u201372, 75\u201377}}\n\nNegotiations about Theodore's marriage with [[Elena Asenina of Bulgaria|Elena of Bulgaria]] started shortly after the [[Battle of Klokotnitsa]]. In the battle, her father, Emperor (or Tzar) [[Ivan Asen II of Bulgaria]], inflicted a crushing defeat on the [[Emperor of Thessalonica]] and ruler of [[Despotate of Epirus|Epirus]], [[Theodore Komnenos Doukas]], early in 1230. The battle weakened Nicaea's rival for the revival of the Byzantine Empire, Epirus, and made [[Second Bulgarian Empire|Bulgaria]] the dominant power of the [[Balkan Peninsula]].{{sfn|Angold|2017|p=738}} The marriage of Theodore and Elena sealed their fathers' alliance against the [[Latin Empire of Constantinople]] in 1235. Bulgarian and Nicaean troops laid [[Siege of Constantinople (1235)|siege to Constantinople]], but could not capture the city. Ivan Asen did a ''[[volte-face]]'', allying himself with the Latins to stop Nicaean expansion in Thrace in 1237, only to return to his alliance with Nicaea before the end of the year. His father-in-law's tactical moves convinced Theodore  for the rest of his life that he could not fully trust the Bulgarians.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=65, 73\u201375}}\n\nTheodore approached a most renowned teacher, [[Nicephorus Blemmydes]], to take classes of philosophy from him. Blemmydes was the [[hegumen]] (or head) of a monastery at [[Ephesus]]. Theodore attended his classes of philosophy while he was staying in his father's winter palace at the nearby [[Nymphaion (Ionia)|Nymphaion]]. Blemmydes' zealous [[Aristotelianism]] had a strong impact on Theodore who often mentioned Aristotelian notions, like [[potentiality and actuality]], in his writings. Blemmydes was accused of [[embezzlement]] by one of his students. Vatatzes' intervention saved him of imprisonment, but he abandoned teaching early in the 1240s. Theodore continued to regularly visit Blemmydes and maintained a correspondence with him. A young scholar from Constantinople, [[George Akropolites]], replaced Blemmydes as Theodore's principal tutor. He had first hand experiences about the Latin rule in the city. He was a secretary, working in the imperial court, and he completed Theodore's education in logic and mathematics.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=79, 85, 117\u2013118}}\n\nTheodore's mother died late in 1239.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|p=88}} Vatatzes re-married in late summer of 1240, taking an illegitimate daughter of [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Anna of Hohenstaufen|Constanza]] whose name was changed to Anna. She was around ten and Vatatzes started a scandalous affair with one of her Italian ladies-in-waiting, named Marchesina. Marchesina was granted the right to wear purple shoes and to harness her horse with purple trappings, like the Emperor's closest relatives.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=90\u201391}}\n\n==Youth==\n\n===First administrative tasks===\n\nIf Theodore's father adopted his predecessors' practice, Theodore was still a child when he was made his father's co-ruler. [[George Akropolites]] mentioned Theodore as a co-emperor when narrating events that occurred from 1235 to 1237 and in 1242. In his correspondence, Theodore referred to himself as \"my imperial majesty\" from around 1242. He was most probably not crowned during his father's lifetime\u2014a likely explanation for the denial of Theodore's co-emperorship in the works of two later Byzantine historians, [[George Pachymeres]] and [[Nicephorus Gregoras]].{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=61, 258 (notes 34 and 36)}} Theodore's authority was considerable. He granted estates and salaries and he could also intervene in legal disputes. On Blemmydes' petition, he ordered [[Nicephorus II of Constantinople|Nicephorus]], the \n[[Metropolis of Ephesus|metropolitan bishop of Ephesus]], to return an allegedly unlawfully purchased piece of land to Blemmydes' monastery. During his father's absence, he presided over the privy council and proposed candidates to Church offices.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=98\u2013101}}\n\nJohn&nbsp;III Vatatzes again [[Siege of Constantinople (1241)|laid siege to Constantinople]] in May 1241, but he could not capture the city and started negotiations with the Latins in the following month. Theodore accompanied his father to the negotiations, ending with a two-year truce on 24 June. John&nbsp;II Asen's death weakened Bulgaria in the same month, enabling Vatatzes to invade the Balkans late in 1241. Before departing for the military campaign, he appointed Theodore his lieutenant in Asia Minor. Theodore held an itinerant court like his father and grandfather, and visited most Anatolian towns and villages.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=92, 100}}\n\nA Mongol general, [[Baiju Noyan|Baiju]], [[Mongol invasions of Anatolia|invaded]] the [[Seljuk Sultanate of Rum]] from the east and captured [[Erzurum]]. Theodore immadiately informed his father, who was besieging [[Thessaloniki|Thessalonica]], but Vatatzes did not abandon the siege. His persistence was rewarded when the ruler of Thessalonica [[John Komnenos Doukas]] renounced the title of emperor and accepted the court title [[Despot (court title)|despot]] from Vatatzes. The Mongols launched a new military campaign against the Seljuks and routed Sultan [[Kaykhusraw II]] in the [[Battle of K\u00f6se Da\u011f]] on 26 June 1243. The Seljuks were forced to pay a yearly tribute to the Mongols. Nicaea remained the only state that preserved full independence, but the fear of a Mongol invasion became a constant element of Nicaean diplomacy. A massive influx of refugees from the Sultanate of Rum reached Nicaea during the following period.{{sfn|Korobeinikov|2017|pp=720\u2013721}}{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=92\u201396}}\n\nVatatzes departed for a new military campaign in the Balkans in 1246. He again charged Theodore with the administration of Asia Minor during his absence. Vatatzes captured Serres before the end of the year. The leading citizens of Thessalonica and Melnik did not risk a prolonged siege and paid homage to Vatatzes voluntarily. As most Macedonian towns followed their example, Vatatzes almost doubled his empire's territory  within a few months.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=92, 96\u201397}}\n\n===Friends===\n\nA bond of close friendship was forged between Theodore and a circle of young intelectuals during his co-emperorship. They were all born after the Latin conquest of Constantinople, without experiencing the shock of exile, unlike many of their fathers' \"humiliated generation\" (as Patriarch [[Germanus II of Constantinople]] referred to them). Theodore's writings reveal that his friends' companion helped him to come through his periods of melancholy, likely caused by anxiety over his public duties. His closest friend, [[George Mouzalon]], had been a page in his childhood entourage. Blemmydes noted that George and his two brothers, Theodore and Andronikos Mouzalon, were \"of despicably low birth\". They were talented singers and musicians who regularly appeared in musical performances in the imperial court. Other confidants of his, like [[Joseph Mesopotamites]] and [[Konstas Hagiotheodorites]], were related to high-ranking officials and churchmen.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=109\u2013118}}\n\nIn his correspondence with his friends, Theodore often made fun of bishops for their self-aggradizement, their barbarian speech or ignorantly heretical statements, or even for their physical appearance. Theodore was also object of mockery: his unnamed fellow students teased him for his arguments in philosophical discussions. Critical remarks made by bishops and aristocrats were more dangerous. Metropolitan Nicephorus of Ephesus, rebuked Theodore for his pride and for his non-observance of the rules of [[fasting]]. A military commander, Kalothetos, often spoke of Theodore without respect. Relationship between Theodore and his father's governor at Thessalonica, [[Theodore Philes]], was extremly tense. Philes circulated deflamatory poems about Theodore's alleged affair with an unnamed woman and Theodore blamed Philes for the murder of Theodore's friend, Tribides. Tribides' fate shows that Theodore started sending his confidants to the newly conquered European territories already during his father's reign. Philes' accusations reached the ears of Blemmydes who did not tolerate sexual misconduct. Blemmydes had recently, around 1248, denied entry Marchesina and her retinue to his monastery at Ephesus. Now, he addressed a mirror of princes, entitled ''Imperial Statue'', to Vatatzes and Theodore, warning them against lechery and the dissipation of public funds. Theodore denied the charges in a series of letters to his former tutor. Theodore also hold a grudge against his second cousin, [[Michael VIII Palaiologos|Michael Palaiologos]], for unknown reason.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=90, 118\u2013125}}\n\n===Towards sole rule===\n\nVatatzes launched a military campaign against the ruler of Epirus, [[Michael II Komnenos Doukas]], in March of April 1252. Before his depature, he appointed Theodore his viceroy in Anatolia. Elena of Bulgaria unexpectedly before the end of the summer. He mourned for his wife for more than the customary fourty days and only abandoned fasting and wearing black on his father's order. His wife's death intensified his melancholy and he dedicated more time to philosophical studies and writing. He resumed his regular visits of the Anatolian towns in 1253.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=92, 128\u2013132}}\n\nEmperor Frederick&nbsp;II's son and successor, [[Conrad IV of Germany|Conrad]], forced most relatives of his father's mistress, [[Bianca Lancia]], into exile early in 1253. They fled to Nicaea and sought asylum in the court of Bianca's daughter, Empress Constanza-Anna. Theodore received the exiles in one of the imperial palaces. Conrad changed his mind and sent the erudite [[Berthold of Hohenburg]], an in-law of the Lancias, to Nicaea to start negotiations with them. While waiting for his father's return from Europe, Theodore and Berthold made philosophical conversations. Interest in ancient philosophy had intensified in Europe. Berthold and the philosophers and phycisians in his retinue wanted to take advantage of his diplomatic mission and asked Theodore to grant Greek philosophical works to them. Their request reinforced Theodore's pride of Hellenism. He also decided to prepare manuscript editions of his philosophical works.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=140\u2013145}}\n\nVatatzes returned to Nicaea in the winter of 1253. Early in 1254, he fell suddenly ill and he never fully recovered. His illnes made Theodore the actual ruler of the empire, but the change of his position did not prevented him from making arrangements for the publications of his works. News about preparations for a new Mongol invasion of Anatolia reached Nicaea, causing concern in the imperial court.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=147\u2013148}}\n\n==Reign==\n\n===Ascension===\n\nJohn&nbsp;III Vatatzes died in Nicaea on 4 November 1254. Theodore was acclaimed emperor, but he could not be crowned because the patriarchal throne was vacant. In his funerary speech at Vatatzes' burial, Acropolites expressed his hope that Theodore would lead the Nicaeans  to expel the Latins from Constantinople, comparing him with the \"[[Pillar of fire (theophany)|pillar of fire]]\" of the [[Book of Exodus]], guiding the [[Israelites]]. Theodore had a meeting with the Seljuk Sultan of Rum, [[Kaykaus II]], in [[Philadelphia (Lydia)|Philadelphia]], and they concluded a defensive alliance against the Mongols shortly after his ascension to the throne. Kaykaus acknowledged the Mongols' suzerainty, but failed to pay homage to the Great Khan [[M\u00f6ngke Khan|M\u00f6ngke]] personally.{{sfn|Korobeinikov|2017|p=721}}{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=148\u2013150}}\n\nThe appointment of a new patriarch was also a main concern for Theodore. He wanted to achieve the appointment of Blemmydes, but his old tutor refused. His next candidate, [[Arsenius Autoreianus|Arsenios Autoreianos]], was a hermit of aristocratic background. Arsenios accepted the offer and he was ordained patriarch. As his first act, the new Patriarch crowned and annointed Theodore emperor\u2014according to scholarly consensus, on Christmas 1254. Arsenios' allegedly irregular appointment would give rise to the conflict known as \"Arsenite Schism\", lasting from 1265 to 1310.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=150, 296 (note 25)}} Arsenios was Theodore's loyal supporter and obeyed his commands.{{sfn|Nicol|1993|p=27}}\n\nTheodore did not trust the aristocrats and wrote of \"illicit love affairs and very unjust plots\" in a letter addressed to George Mouzalon in December 1254, without naming his opponents. Historian [[Michael Angold]] proposes that Emperor Frederick&nbsp;II's similary policy may have inspired Theodore's \"more autocratic stance towards his aristocracy\".{{sfn|Angold|2017|p=748}} Theodore appointed George to be the commander-in-chief of the mobile army as the new ''[[megas domestikos]]''. George's brother, Andronikos, was designated as the new ''[[protovestiarites]]'' (or commander of the guards of the imperial palace). He also demonstrated his favor towards a general of common origin, [[Constantine Margarites]]. His appointments offended the military aristocracy of the empire. He also tried to compensate the aristocrats who had been put aside during this father's reign. He recalled his mother's uncles, Michael and Manuel Laskaris, from their exile and made two members of the rebellious Nestongos family, George and Isaac, generals.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=151\u2013152}}\n\n===Wars with Bulgaria===\n\n[[Michael II Asen]], the young Tzar of Bulgaria, exploited Vatatzes' death and invaded Thrace and Macedonia in December 1254 or January 1255.{{sfn|Treadgold|1997|p=721}}{{sfn|Nicol|1993|p=28}}{{sfn|Fine|2009|p=159}} The Nicaean garrisons at most Thracian and Macedonian fortresses were small and the local Bulgarians did not resist the invaders.{{sfn|Fine|2009|p=159}} The Bulgarian troops seized Thracian fortresses and two Macedonian towns, [[Veles, North Macedonia|Veles]] and [[Skopje]], on the river [[Vardar]]. A hastily summoned council of war accepted George Mouzalon's proposal about an immediate counter-attack. Theodore assembled an army and departed for Adrianople in February 1255, charging Mouzalon with the administration of Anatolia. His surprise attack forced the Bulgarian to withdraw from Thrace and he appointed two aristocrats, [[Alexios Strategopoulos]] and [[Demetrios Torinikes]] to continue the military campaign against the Bulgarians. While marching across the passes of the [[Rhodope Mountains]], the two generals mistook the sounds of the horns of shepherds ans swineherds with signals of an ambush. They fled in panic, abandoning their baggage. Their fiasco outraged Theodore who ordered them to return, but Strategopoulos and Torinikes disobeyed.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=151\u2013154}}\n\nA Bulgarian renegate in Nicaean service, Dragotas, switched sides and laid siege to Melnik in the summer of 1255. Theodore departed from Adrianople to Melnik. He avoided the ambush that the Bulgarians had lain along the [[Rupel Pass]] before reaching Melnik and forcing Dragotas to abandon the siege. He visited Thessalonica where he dismissed Philes, Strategopoulos and Torinikes. He also closed down the local mint and established a new treasury in Astritzion on the Asian coast of the [[Hellespont]], because he wanted to concentrate the administration of his finances in Anatolia instead of the rebellious Balkans. Theodore invaded Macedonia and forced the Bulgarian garrison in Veles to surrender, but drought prevented him from marching across the [[Ov\u010de Pole]], forcing him to return to Serres. He confirmed the nearby towns' fiscal privileges, but he ordered the arrest of [[Constantine Kabasila]], [[Archbishop of Ohrid]], assuming that Kabasila was Michael&nbsp;II of Epirus' loyal supporter.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=156\u2013159}}\n\nA report about a Mongol invasion of Anatolia forced him to leave Macedonia in late autumn. He hurried to Adrianople where he realized that the report was distorted. Theodore launched an attack against the fortress of [[Tzepaina]], but his army could not cross the narrow and frosty passes of the Rhodope and Theodore returned to Anatolia at the end of 1255. He showered his confidants with honors and gifts. He made Manuel Laskaris and Constantine Margarites the commander-in-chief of his troops in Thrace and charged George Mouzalon with the implementation of military reforms. On the other hand, members of old aristocratic families were punished. Constantine Strategopoulos and Theodore Philes were blinded, while Alexios Strategopoulos and [[Alexios Raoul]]'s four sons were imprisoned. Michael Palaiologos fled to the Seljuks to escape imprisonment. He take advantage of the emperors' right to control aristocratic marriages to establish family ties between his lowborn favorites and the old aristocracy. George Mouzalon married a niece of Michael Palaiologos, [[Theodora Raoulaina|Theodora Kantakouzene Palaiologina]], his brother, Andronikos, wed a daughter of [[Alexios Raoul]].{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=159\u2013162, 169}}\n\nTheodore resumed negotiations about the [[church union]] in April or May 1256. He sent envoys to [[Pope Alexander IV]], offering his mediation between the Pope and the Patriarch. The Catholic and Orthodox Churches had adopted different views about the procession of the [[Holy Spirit in Christianity|Holy Spirit]]. Orthodox theologians maintained that the [[Eastern Orthodox teaching regarding the Filioque|Holy Spirit procceeded from the Father alone]], while Catholic theologians stated that the Holy Spirit proceeded from the [[God the Father|Father]] [[filioque|and the Son]]. Theodore commissioned Blemmydes to summarize the Orthodox position. Blemmydes adopted a conciliatory approach, saying that the Bible and the [[Church Fathers]] suggested that the Holy Spirit processed from the Father through the [[God the Son|Son]], but Theodore insisted on the traditional Orthodox doctrine. The Pope sent Constantine, [[Bishop of Orvieto]], as his legate to Theodore.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=162\u2013163}}\n\nMichael&nbsp;II of Bulgaria dispatched Cuman raiders to plunder Thrace early in 1256. Theodore had instructed Laskaris and Margarites to keep a defensive strategy. They ignored his instruction and chased the Cumans, who inflicted a heavy defeat on the Nicaean troops. Theodore assembled a new army, partially mustered among the Anatolian peasantry, and crossed the Hellespont. He sent troops, including Cuman horsemen in his service, against the invaders and the Nicaean troops defeated the enemy forces in two battles in Thrace. He entered into peace negotiations with Michael&nbsp;II with the mediation of [[Rostislav Mikhailovich]], [[Banate of Macs\u00f3|Duke of Macs\u00f3]]. Michael&nbsp;II had recently married Rostislav's daughter and Rostislav's wife, [[Anna of Hungary, Duchess of Macs\u00f3|Anna of Hungary]], was Theodore's cousin. Rostislav came to Thrace to reach an agreement with Theodore. Akropolites drafted a treaty about the restoration of the prewar boundaries between Nicaea and Bulgaria. Rostislav accepted it and signed the peace treaty on Michael&nbsp;II's behalf on 29 June. The treaty prescribed Michael&nbsp;II to cede Tzepaina to the Nicaeans, but the Bulgarian garrison was not withdrawn from the fortress. Theodore became convinced that Rostislav had deceived him and ordered the public whipping of Akropolites in a fit of anger. His act proved imprudent, because the Bulgarians ceded the fortress in early September.{{sfn|Fine|2009|p=159}}{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=164\u2013166}}\n\n===Triumphs===\n\nFrom Thrace, Theodore went to Thessalonica where he entered into negotiations with Michael&nbsp;II of Epirus's wife, [[Theodora of Arta|Theodora Petraliphaina]]. To secure a lasting peace with Nicaea and avoid imprisonment, she agreed to cede [[Servia, Greece|Servia]] and [[Dyrrachium]] to Theodore, establishing the Nicaean control of the [[Via Egnatia]]. Theodore married off his daughter, Maria to the heir to the Epirote throne, [[Nikephoros I Komnenos Doukas|Nikephoros Komnenos Doukas]], in October, but his territorial demands alienated Michael&nbsp;II.{{sfn|Nicol|1993|p=28}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1997|p=721}}{{sfn|Fine|2009|p=160}} Theodore also received the papal legate, but their negotiations proved fruitless and Constantine of Orvieto died during his journey back to Italy. Theodore maintained a correspondence with powerful [[Cardinal (Catholic Church)|cardinals]], like [[Richard Annibaldi]], [[Peter Capoccio]] and [[Ottaviano degli Ubaldini]], but he refused to make concessions for the church union.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|p=169}}\n\nThe Mongols invaded Anatolia and defeated Kaykaus&nbsp;II on 14 October 1256. On learning of the Mongol invasion, Theodore hurried back to Anatolia. Kaykaus sought asylum in Nicaea and the Mongols installed his brother, [[Kilij Arslan IV]], as the new sultan of Rum. Theodore assembled his troops on the plains near [[Magnesia on the Maeander|Magnesia]]. The Mongol ruler of Persia, the [[Ilkhan (title)|Ilkhan]] [[Hulagu Khan|H\u00fclag\u00fc]] sent an embassy to Theodore and he persuaded the Ilkhan to withdraw his army from Anatolia. H\u00fcleg\u00fc also allowed Kaykaus to return to Rum, ordering the division of the sultanate between Kaykaus and his brother in the spring of 1257. Theodore concluded an agreement with Kaykaus who ceded four fortresses in the valley of the river [[Lycus (river of Phrygia)|Lycus]] to him in return for a contingent of 300 auxiliary troops from Nicaea.{{sfn|Korobeinikov|2017|pp=721\u2013722}}{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=169\u2013171}}\n\nBulgaria fell into a state of anarchy. Michael&nbsp;II was dethroned by his cousin, [[Kaliman Asen II of Bulgaria|Kaliman&nbsp;II]], but Kaliman was murdered by [[boyar]]s (or noblemen). Rostislav Mikhailovich and Michael&nbsp;II's brother-in-law, [[Mitso Asen of Bulgaria|Mitso]], laid claim to the throne, but most boyars offered their allegiance to one of their number, [[Konstantin Tih]], although he was not related to the [[Asen dynasty]]. Theodore's daughters by Elena were Tzar Ivan Asen&nbsp;II's granddaughters. Konstantin reputiated his wife and sued for the hand of Theodore's eldest daughter, [[Irene Doukaina Laskarina|Irene]]. Theodore agreed and sent her to Bulgaria to marry the Tzar.{{sfn|Treadgold|1997|p=722}}{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=166\u2013167}}{{sfn|Fine|2009|p=172}}\n\n===Illness and death===\n\nTheodore was complacent after his achievements. He proadly stated that his empire included territories as far as Dyrrachium on the [[Adriatic Sea]] and [[Do\u011fanyurt|Cape Karambis]] on the [[Black Sea]]. His success during the war against Bulgaria had convinced him that he should recruit soldiers from among Anatolian peasants. In a letter to Blemmydes, he stated that the \"Hellenes\" were more reliable than foreign mercenaries. Theodore fell seriously ill in November 1257. [[George Pachymeres]], who was less than sixteen around that time, diagnozed his illness as epilepsy. Akropolites and Blemmydes did not mention epilepsy. Akropolites only mentioned that Theodore lost weight and \"his entire body was reduced to a skeleton\". In a letter to Blemmydes, Theodore wrote of insufferable aching and paralysis in the arm. His illness cannot identified certainly, but it could be epilepsy of the grand-mal type or cancer of the brain, the spine or the lungs. He could no more command his troops personally.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=172\u2013174, 176, 381\u2013383}} \n\nIn Macedonia, Theodore had dismissed the commanders of noble origin with close family ties to the local aristocracy with Anatolian officers of humble origin. His appointees, however, could not resist after Michael&nbsp;II of Epirus had incited the local Albanian chiefs to a rebellion in late 1256. He also made an alliance with [[Stefan Uro\u0161 I]], [[King of Serbia]], who intervened in the conflict and defeated Theodore's local commander, Xyleas, near [[Prilep]]. An other newly appointed Nicaean commander, [[Constantine Chabaron]], was trapped, allegedly through love letters that Michael&nbsp;II's sister-in-law, Maria Petraliphina, had sent to him. Theodore sent an army of peasant soldiers to Macedonia, but they were routed at [[Edessa|Edessa, Greece]]. Michael Palaiologos, who had been allowed to return from his exile, lead a new army to Macedonia. He defeated the Epirotes, but Theodore ordered him to return instead of marching to Prilep. Palaiologos' withdrawal enabled Michael&nbsp;II to seize Prilep and capture Akropolites. Michael&nbsp;II was planning to launch an attack against Thessalonica, but Emperor Frederick&nbsp;II's illegitimate son, [[Manfred, King of Sicily|Manfred]], who had taken control of the [[Kingdom of Sicily]] after the death of his stepbrother, Conrad, invaded Epirus from the west. Michael&nbsp;II who did not want to abandon his plan concluded an alliance with Manfred. Manfred captured Dyrrachium and other fortresses on the Adriatic by the end of February 1258.{{sfn|Nicol|1993|p=28}}{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=175\u2013176}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1997|p=722}}{{sfn|Fine|2009|p=161}}\n\nTheodore rarely left his palace at Magnesia during the last months of his life. He became convinced that sorcery had caused his illness. Theodore had forced Michael Palaiologos's niece, Theodore to marry the elderly Basil Kaballarios. The marriage was never consummated and Kaballarios accused Theodora's, Maria-Martha Palaiologna, of witchcraft. She was publicly humilated and tortured. Although she did not confess, Theodore ordered the imprisonment of her brother, Michael Palaiologos, for a while. Theodore named his seven-year-old son, [[John IV Laskaris|John]], as his sole heir, appointing George Mouzalon regent until John came of age. He became a monk, but he kept his baptismal name. He summarized his sins in a treatise and asked the patriarchal synod to grant him absolution. He died in the imperial palace at Magnesia on 16 August 1258. He was buried next to his father in the Sosandra monastery on [[Mount Sipylus]]. His grave and the monastery was destroyed after the Turkish conquest of the region in the 13th&nbsp;century.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=178\u2013180}}\n\nThe aristocrats had taken an oath of loyalty to Mouzalon at Theodore's deathbed, but they soon began conspiring against him. In ten days, Mouzalon was murdered and Michael Palaiologos assumed the regency for the child-emperor, John&nbsp;IV Laskaris. Palaiologos convinced the aristocrats that an empire ruled by a boy could not resist enemy attacks and he was proclaimed emperor as Michael&nbsp;VIII before the end of the year. Early in 1259, Michael&nbsp;VIII and John&nbsp;IV were crowned together. The Patriarch put the crown first on Michael&nbsp;VIII's head. After concluding an agreement with Genoa against the Latin Empire, he dispatched Alexios Strategopoulos to spy out the defences of Constantinople. Taking advantage of the absence of the bulk of the Latin army, Strategopoulos seized Constantinople by a surprise attack on 25 July 1261. Michael&nbsp;VIII was crowned for the second time alone in the [[Hagia Sophia]].{{sfn|Fine|2009|p=161}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1997|p=722}}{{sfn|Nicol|1993|pp=29\u201336}} The child John&nbsp;IV was blinded on 25 December 1261, because blindness disabled him to rule.{{sfn|Failler|1980|p=65}} His three unmarried sisters were married off to Italian and Bulgarian noblemen, because Michael&nbsp;VIII wanted to demonstrate that the Laskarids had lost their imperial status.{{sfn|Nicol|1993|pp=44\u201345}}\n\nInternally, Theodore favored bureaucrats from the middle classes instead of members of the great aristocratic families. Michael Angold explains this as in part, a matter of his temperament:\n: He [Theodore] was happier in the company of a cultivated circle of friends, some of whom had been his childhood companions (''paidopoula''). He clearly disliked what he considered the philistinism prevalent among a section of the young men at his father's court.<ref>Angold, ''A Byzantine Government in Exile: Government and Society Under the Laskarids of Nicaea (1204-1261)'' (Oxford: University Press, 1975), p. 76</ref>\n\n==Scholarship==\n\nTheodore was a scholar and transformed his court into a center of a scholars. He also ordered that books that he and his father had collected in urban libraries be available to all who wanted to read them.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|p=106}}{{sfn|Nicol|1993|p=27}} \n\n==Family==\n\nNeither Theodore nor Elena reached the minimum legal age of marriage\u2014fourteen for boys and twelfe for girls\u2014when they were married, but such an early marriage was not unique among Nicaean aristocrats and commoners. She was born to Ivan Asen&nbsp;II and [[Anna Maria of Hungary|Maria of Hungary]] in 1224. The wedding took place at Lampsakos early in 1235. Two years later, before launching an invasion of Nicaean territories in Thrace, her father forced Elena to return to Bulgaria, but peace was restored between the two empires and Elena returned to Theodore before the end of the year. Years later, Theodore described Elena as the flower of his youth and stated that their \"bond of incomparable love\" made them \"happier than all people\". Her sudden death in the spring or summer of 1252 plunged Theodore into grief. She gave birth to four or five daughters, and one son.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=72\u201375}} Their children are the following:\n*[[Irene Doukaina Laskarina|Irene]] who married [[Constantine Tikh of Bulgaria]] was Emperor Michael&nbsp;VIII's implacable enemy until her death around 1270.{{sfn|Failler|1980|p=67}}\n*Maria who married [[Nikephoros I Komnenos Doukas|Nikephoros I of Epirus]] deceased between early in 1257 and 1265.{{sfn|Failler|1980|p=68}}{{sfn|Fine|2009|p=169}}\n*Theodora was married off by Michael&nbsp;VIII to a [[Morea|Morean]] nobleman, ''Ma\u00efos D\u00e9b\u00e9likourtos'', according to Pachymeres and [[Nicephorus Gregoras]].

He was the only child of Emperor [[John III Doukas Vatatzes]] and [[Irene Lascarina]], the daughter of [[Theodore I Laskaris]] who had established Nicaea after the Byzantine capital, Constantinople, was captured by the crusaders of the [[Fourth Crusade]] in 1204. Theodore received excellent education from two renowned scholars, [[Nicephorus Blemmydes]] and [[George Akropolites]]. He made friends with young intelectuals, especially with a page of low birth, [[George Mouzalon]]. Theodore started to write treatises on theological, historical and philosophical themes in his youth. \n\nEmperor John&nbsp;III arranged Theodore's marriage with [[Elena Asenina of Bulgaria|Elena of Bulgaria]] to forge an alliance with her father, [[Ivan Asen II of Bulgaria|Ivan Asen&nbsp;II]] in 1235. Their marriage was happy and they had at least five children. Theodore acted as his father's lieutenant in [[Asia Minor]] during his father's campaigns in the [[Balkan Peninsula]] from 1241. He became his father's co-ruler around 1242, but he was not crowned co-emperor. His relationship with [[Theodore Philes]], [[Michael VIII Palaiologos|Michael Palaiologos]] and other aristocrats became tense during this period.\n\nTheodore succeeded his father on 4 November 1254. He dismissed many high officials and army commanders of aristocratic origin, replacing them with his commoner confidants. He made a deffensive alliance with [[Kaykaus II]], the [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuk]] [[Sultanate of Rum|Sultan of Rum]], against the [[Mongol Empire]]. He repelled a Bulgarian invasion of Thrace and Macedonia and forced [[Michael II Komnenos Doukas]], the ruler of [[Despotate of Epirus|Epirus]] to cede [[Dyrrachium]] on the coast of the [[Adriatic Sea]] to Nicaea. He introduced a military reform, recruiting more soldiers from among the native peasantry of Asia Minor. Michael&nbsp;II of Epiros forged an alliance with [[Stefan Uro\u0161 I]], [[King of Serbia]], and [[Manfred of Sicily]] and Theodore's newly appointed generals could not resist their joint invasion in 1257. Theodore fell seriously ill and could rarely take part in state administration during the last months of his life. He appointed George Mouzalon [[regent]] for his underage son, [[John IV Laskaris|John&nbsp;IV]] before he died of chronic [[epilepsy]] or cancer. In ten days, Mouzalon fell victim to an aristocratic plot and Michael Palaiologos assumed regency. \n\n==Early life==\n\n===Childhood===\n\n{{See also|Laskaris|Vatatzes}}\n\nTheodore was born to Emperor [[John III Doukas Vatatzes]] and [[Irene Lascarina]] in the imperial palace in [[Nicaea]] in late 1221 or early 1222.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|p=57}} Irene was the eldest daughter of [[Theodore I Laskaris]], the founder of the [[Empire of Nicaea]].{{sfn|Angelov|2019|p=57}} Nicaea was a successor state of the [[Byzantine Empire]], established after the crusaders (or Latins) [[Sack of Constantinople|captured Constantinople]]  during the [[Fourth Crusade]] in 1204.{{sfn|Nicol|1993|pp=10\u201311}} Vatatzes was Irene's third husband. He was born into a Byzantine aristocratic family related to the imperial [[Komnenos]] and [[Angelos]] dynasties. When he wed Irene, he served as the commander of the [[Vestiaritai|imperial guard]]. Although Irene's two brothers had died prematurely, Theodore&nbsp;I did not name Vatatzes as his official heir. He most likely expected that his third wife, the Latin [[Maria of Courtenay]], would bear sons, but he did not father children with her.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=32\u201334}} Theodore&nbsp;I died in November 1221. Vatatzes had to defeat the late emperor's brothers, Alexios and Isaac Laskaris, to seize the throne. His victory over his wife's uncles and their Latin allies in the [[Battle of Poimanenon]] in the winter of 1223\u20131224 opened the way to the reconquest of Byzantine territories lost to the Latins in [[Asia Minor]].{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=57\u201359}}\n\nTheodore was his parents' only child. His mother suffered a horse accident and could not bear children after his birth. He adopted his mother's family name.{{sfn|Treadgold|1997|p=721}}  He was \"raised as usual for a royal child\", according to his own words, most probably referring to his unbringing in the women's quarter of the palace and the luxory surrounding him. His childhood was joyful and he \"often received greatest solace\" from his father. He also remembered that his parents did not punish him when his tutor had accused him of misdemeanors.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=59\u201360, 257 (notes 21\u201322)}}\n\n===Education===\n\n[[File:Nicaea's Byzantine fortifications, Iznik, Turkey (37799778844).jpg|thumb|right|alt=Ruins of stone walls.|Ruins of the walls of Nicaea.]]\n\nIf Theodore's formal education started at the age when most other aristocratic children were taught to write and read, he was entrusted to an elementary teacher's care in 1228.  He had to pray three times a day and to memorize texts from the Bible. He could quote from the [[psalms]] and the [[parables of Jesus]] by heart till the end of his life.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=64\u201366}} Theodore's secondary education started around 1230. He detested his principal tutor (or ''[[baioulos]]'') and described him as a \"great babbler\" in his works, without mentioning his name. He studied grammar (that is [[Attic Greek]]), poetry, rhetoric, logic, mathematics, astronomy, geometry and music for three years. His grammatical studies raised his lifelong interest in words with multiple meaning and in [[Etymology|etymologies]]. The young Theodore was captivated by the orations of [[Demosthenes]] and [[Hermogenes of Tarsus]]. He also highly esteemed the theologian [[Gregory of Nazianzus]]. His tutor mocked him for \"philosophizing\" and urged Theodore to spend more time with military and diplomatic studies.

In the battle, her father, Emperor (or Tzar) [[Ivan Asen II of Bulgaria]], inflicted a crushing defeat on the [[Emperor of Thessalonica]] and ruler of [[Despotate of Epirus|Epirus]], [[Theodore Komnenos Doukas]], early in 1230. The battle weakened Nicaea's rival for the revival of the Byzantine Empire, Epirus, and made [[Second Bulgarian Empire|Bulgaria]] the dominant power of the [[Balkan Peninsula]].{{sfn|Angold|2017|p=738}} The marriage of Theodore and Elena sealed their fathers' alliance against the [[Latin Empire of Constantinople]] in 1235. Bulgarian and Nicaean troops laid [[Siege of Constantinople (1235)|siege to Constantinople]], but could not capture the city. Ivan Asen did a ''[[volte-face]]'', allying himself with the Latins to stop Nicaean expansion in Thrace in 1237, only to return to his alliance with Nicaea before the end of the year. His father-in-law's tactical moves convinced Theodore  for the rest of his life that he could not fully trust the Bulgarians.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=65, 73\u201375}}\n\nTheodore approached a most renowned teacher, [[Nicephorus Blemmydes]], to take classes of philosophy from him. Blemmydes was the [[hegumen]] (or head) of a monastery at [[Ephesus]]. Theodore attended his classes of philosophy while he was staying in his father's winter palace at the nearby [[Nymphaion (Ionia)|Nymphaion]]. Blemmydes' zealous [[Aristotelianism]] had a strong impact on Theodore who often mentioned Aristotelian notions, like [[potentiality and actuality]], in his writings. Blemmydes was accused of [[embezzlement]] by one of his students. Vatatzes' intervention saved him of imprisonment, but he abandoned teaching early in the 1240s. Theodore continued to regularly visit Blemmydes and maintained a correspondence with him. A young scholar from Constantinople, [[George Akropolites]], replaced Blemmydes as Theodore's principal tutor. He had first hand experiences about the Latin rule in the city. He was a secretary, working in the imperial court, and he completed Theodore's education in logic and mathematics.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=79, 85, 117\u2013118}}\n\nTheodore's mother died late in 1239.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|p=88}} Vatatzes re-married in late summer of 1240, taking an illegitimate daughter of [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Anna of Hohenstaufen|Constanza]] whose name was changed to Anna. She was around ten and Vatatzes started a scandalous affair with one of her Italian ladies-in-waiting, named Marchesina. Marchesina was granted the right to wear purple shoes and to harness her horse with purple trappings, like the Emperor's closest relatives.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=90\u201391}}\n\n==Youth==\n\n===First administrative tasks===\n\nIf Theodore's father adopted his predecessors' practice, Theodore was still a child when he was made his father's co-ruler. [[George Akropolites]] mentioned Theodore as a co-emperor when narrating events that occurred from 1235 to 1237 and in 1242. In his correspondence, Theodore referred to himself as \"my imperial majesty\" from around 1242. He was most probably not crowned during his father's lifetime\u2014a likely explanation for the denial of Theodore's co-emperorship in the works of two later Byzantine historians, [[George Pachymeres]] and [[Nicephorus Gregoras]].{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=61, 258 (notes 34 and 36)}} Theodore's authority was considerable. He granted estates and salaries and he could also intervene in legal disputes. On Blemmydes' petition, he ordered [[Nicephorus II of Constantinople|Nicephorus]], the \n[[Metropolis of Ephesus|metropolitan bishop of Ephesus]], to return an allegedly unlawfully purchased piece of land to Blemmydes' monastery. During his father's absence, he presided over the privy council and proposed candidates to Church offices.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=98\u2013101}}\n\nJohn&nbsp;III Vatatzes again [[Siege of Constantinople (1241)|laid siege to Constantinople]] in May 1241, but he could not capture the city and started negotiations with the Latins in the following month. Theodore accompanied his father to the negotiations, ending with a two-year truce on 24 June. John&nbsp;II Asen's death weakened Bulgaria in the same month, enabling Vatatzes to invade the Balkans late in 1241. Before departing for the military campaign, he appointed Theodore his lieutenant in Asia Minor. Theodore held an itinerant court like his father and grandfather, and visited most Anatolian towns and villages.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=92, 100}}\n\nA Mongol general, [[Baiju Noyan|Baiju]], [[Mongol invasions of Anatolia|invaded]] the [[Seljuk Sultanate of Rum]] from the east and captured [[Erzurum]]. Theodore immadiately informed his father, who was besieging [[Thessaloniki|Thessalonica]], but Vatatzes did not abandon the siege. His persistence was rewarded when the ruler of Thessalonica [[John Komnenos Doukas]] renounced the title of emperor and accepted the court title [[Despot (court title)|despot]] from Vatatzes. The Mongols launched a new military campaign against the Seljuks and routed Sultan [[Kaykhusraw II]] in the [[Battle of K\u00f6se Da\u011f]] on 26 June 1243. The Seljuks were forced to pay a yearly tribute to the Mongols. Nicaea remained the only state that preserved full independence, but the fear of a Mongol invasion became a constant element of Nicaean diplomacy. A massive influx of refugees from the Sultanate of Rum reached Nicaea during the following period.{{sfn|Korobeinikov|2017|pp=720\u2013721}}{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=92\u201396}}\n\nVatatzes departed for a new military campaign in the Balkans in 1246. He again charged Theodore with the administration of Asia Minor during his absence. Vatatzes captured Serres before the end of the year. The leading citizens of Thessalonica and Melnik did not risk a prolonged siege and paid homage to Vatatzes voluntarily. As most Macedonian towns followed their example, Vatatzes almost doubled his empire's territory  within a few months.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=92, 96\u201397}}\n\n===Friends===\n\nA bond of close friendship was forged between Theodore and a circle of young intelectuals during his co-emperorship. They were all born after the Latin conquest of Constantinople, without experiencing the shock of exile, unlike many of their fathers' \"humiliated generation\" (as Patriarch [[Germanus II of Constantinople]] referred to them). Theodore's writings reveal that his friends' companion helped him to come through his periods of melancholy, likely caused by anxiety over his public duties. His closest friend, [[George Mouzalon]], had been a page in his childhood entourage. Blemmydes noted that George and his two brothers, Theodore and Andronikos Mouzalon, were \"of despicably low birth\". They were talented singers and musicians who regularly appeared in musical performances in the imperial court. Other confidants of his, like [[Joseph Mesopotamites]] and [[Konstas Hagiotheodorites]], were related to high-ranking officials and churchmen.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=109\u2013118}}\n\nIn his correspondence with his friends, Theodore often made fun of bishops for their self-aggradizement, their barbarian speech or ignorantly heretical statements, or even for their physical appearance. Theodore was also object of mockery: his unnamed fellow students teased him for his arguments in philosophical discussions. Critical remarks made by bishops and aristocrats were more dangerous. The [[Metropolis of Ephesus|metropolitan bishop of Ephesus, [[Nicephorus II of Constantinople|Nicephorus]], rebuked Theodore for his pride and for his non-observance of the rules of [[fasting]]. A military commander, Kalothetos, often spoke of Theodore without respect. Relationship between Theodore and his father's governor at Thessalonica, [[Theodore Philes]], was extremly tense. Philes circulated deflamatory poems about Theodore's alleged affair with an unnamed woman and Theodore blamed Philes for the murder of Theodore's friend, Tribides. Tribides' fate shows that Theodore started sending his confidants to the newly conquered European territories already during his father's reign. Philes' accusations reached the ears of Blemmydes who did not tolerate sexual misconduct. Blemmydes had recently, around 1248, denied entry Marchesina and her retinue to his monastery at Ephesus. Now, he addressed a mirror of princes, entitled ''Imperial Statue'', to Vatatzes and Theodore, warning them against lechery and the dissipation of public funds. Theodore denied the charges in a series of letters to his former tutor. Theodore also hold a grudge against his second cousin, [[Michael VIII Palaiologos|Michael Palaiologos]], for unknown reason.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=90, 118\u2013125}}\n\n===Towards sole rule===\n\nVatatzes launched a military campaign against the ruler of Epirus, [[Michael II Komnenos Doukas]], in March of April 1252. Before his depature, he appointed Theodore his viceroy in Anatolia. Elena of Bulgaria unexpectedly before the end of the summer. He mourned for his wife for more than the customary fourty days and only abandoned fasting and wearing black on his father's order. His wife's death intensified his melancholy and he dedicated more time to philosophical studies and writing. He resumed his regular visits of the Anatolian towns in 1253.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=92, 128\u2013132}}\n\nEmperor Frederick&nbsp;II's son and successor, [[Conrad IV of Germany|Conrad]], forced most relatives of his father's mistress, [[Bianca Lancia]], into exile early in 1253. They fled to Nicaea and sought asylum in the court of Bianca's daughter, Empress Constanza-Anna. Theodore received the exiles in one of the imperial palaces. Conrad changed his mind and sent the erudite [[Berthold of Hohenburg]], an in-law of the Lancias, to Nicaea to start negotiations with them. While waiting for his father's return from Europe, Theodore and Berthold made philosophical conversations. Interest in ancient philosophy had intensified in Europe. Berthold and the philosophers and phycisians in his retinue wanted to take advantage of his diplomatic mission and asked Theodore to grant Greek philosophical works to them. Their request reinforced Theodore's pride of Hellenism. He also decided to prepare manuscript editions of his philosophical works.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=140\u2013145}}\n\nVatatzes returned to Nicaea in the winter of 1253. Early in 1254, he fell suddenly ill and he never fully recovered. His illnes made Theodore the actual ruler of the empire, but the change of his position did not prevented him from making arrangements for the publications of his works. News about preparations for a new Mongol invasion of Anatolia reached Nicaea, causing concern in the imperial court.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=147\u2013148}}\n\n==Reign==\n\n===Ascension===\n\nJohn&nbsp;III Vatatzes died in Nicaea on 4 November 1254. Theodore was acclaimed emperor, but he could not be crowned because the patriarchal throne was vacant. In his funerary speech at Vatatzes' burial, Acropolites expressed his hope that Theodore would lead the Nicaeans  to expel the Latins from Constantinople, comparing him with the \"[[Pillar of fire (theophany)|pillar of fire]]\" of the [[Book of Exodus]], guiding the [[Israelites]]. Theodore had a meeting with the Seljuk Sultan of Rum, [[Kaykaus II]], in [[Philadelphia (Lydia)|Philadelphia]], and they concluded a defensive alliance against the Mongols shortly after his ascension to the throne. Kaykaus acknowledged the Mongols' suzerainty, but failed to pay homage to the Great Khan [[M\u00f6ngke Khan|M\u00f6ngke]] personally.{{sfn|Korobeinikov|2017|p=721}}{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=148\u2013150}}\n\nThe appointment of a new patriarch was also a main concern for Theodore. He wanted to achieve the appointment of Blemmydes, but his old tutor refused. His next candidate, [[Arsenius Autoreianus|Arsenios Autoreianos]], was a hermit of aristocratic background. Arsenios accepted the offer and he was ordained patriarch. As his first act, the new Patriarch crowned and annointed Theodore emperor\u2014according to scholarly consensus, on Christmas 1254. Arsenios' allegedly irregular appointment would give rise to the conflict known as \"Arsenite Schism\", lasting from 1265 to 1310.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=150, 296 (note 25)}} Arsenios was Theodore's loyal supporter and obeyed his commands.{{sfn|Nicol|1993|p=27}}\n\nTheodore did not trust the aristocrats and wrote of \"illicit love affairs and very unjust plots\" in a letter addressed to George Mouzalon in December 1254, without naming his opponents. Historian [[Michael Angold]] proposes that Emperor Frederick&nbsp;II's similary policy may have inspired Theodore's \"more autocratic stance towards his aristocracy\".{{sfn|Angold|2017|p=748}} Theodore appointed George to be the commander-in-chief of the mobile army as the new ''[[megas domestikos]]''. George's brother, Andronikos, was designated as the new ''[[protovestiarites]]'' (or commander of the guards of the imperial palace). He also demonstrated his favor towards a general of common origin, [[Constantine Margarites]]. His appointments offended the military aristocracy of the empire. He also tried to compensate the aristocrats who had been put aside during this father's reign. He recalled his mother's uncles, Michael and Manuel Laskaris, from their exile and made two members of the rebellious Nestongos family, George and Isaac, generals.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=151\u2013152}}\n\n===Wars with Bulgaria===\n\n[[Michael II Asen]], the young Tzar of Bulgaria, exploited Vatatzes' death and invaded Thrace and Macedonia in December 1254 or January 1255.{{sfn|Treadgold|1997|p=721}}{{sfn|Nicol|1993|p=28}}{{sfn|Fine|2009|p=159}} The Nicaean garrisons at most Thracian and Macedonian fortresses were small and the local Bulgarians did not resist the invaders.{{sfn|Fine|2009|p=159}} The Bulgarian troops seized Thracian fortresses and two Macedonian towns, [[Veles, North Macedonia|Veles]] and [[Skopje]], on the river [[Vardar]]. A hastily summoned council of war accepted George Mouzalon's proposal about an immediate counter-attack. Theodore assembled an army and departed for Adrianople in February 1255, charging Mouzalon with the administration of Anatolia. His surprise attack forced the Bulgarian to withdraw from Thrace and he appointed two aristocrats, [[Alexios Strategopoulos]] and [[Demetrios Torinikes]] to continue the military campaign against the Bulgarians. While marching across the passes of the [[Rhodope Mountains]], the two generals mistook the sounds of the horns of shepherds ans swineherds with signals of an ambush. They fled in panic, abandoning their baggage. Their fiasco outraged Theodore who ordered them to return, but Strategopoulos and Torinikes disobeyed.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=151\u2013154}}\n\nA Bulgarian renegate in Nicaean service, Dragotas, switched sides and laid siege to Melnik in the summer of 1255. Theodore departed from Adrianople to Melnik. He avoided the ambush that the Bulgarians had lain along the [[Rupel Pass]] before reaching Melnik and forcing Dragotas to abandon the siege. He visited Thessalonica where he dismissed Philes, Strategopoulos and Torinikes. He also closed down the local mint and established a new treasury in Astritzion on the Asian coast of the [[Hellespont]], because he wanted to concentrate the administration of his finances in Anatolia instead of the rebellious Balkans. Theodore invaded Macedonia and forced the Bulgarian garrison in Veles to surrender, but drought prevented him from marching across the [[Ov\u010de Pole]], forcing him to return to Serres. He confirmed the nearby towns' fiscal privileges, but he ordered the arrest of [[Constantine Kabasila]], [[Archbishop of Ohrid]], assuming that Kabasila was Michael&nbsp;II of Epirus' loyal supporter.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=156\u2013159}}\n\nA report about a Mongol invasion of Anatolia forced him to leave Macedonia in late autumn. He hurried to Adrianople where he realized that the report was distorted. Theodore launched an attack against the fortress of [[Tzepaina]], but his army could not cross the narrow and frosty passes of the Rhodope and Theodore returned to Anatolia at the end of 1255. He showered his confidants with honors and gifts. He made Manuel Laskaris and Constantine Margarites the commander-in-chief of his troops in Thrace and charged George Mouzalon with the implementation of military reforms. On the other hand, members of old aristocratic families were punished. Constantine Strategopoulos and Theodore Philes were blinded, while Alexios Strategopoulos and [[Alexios Raoul]]'s four sons were imprisoned. Michael Palaiologos fled to the Seljuks to escape imprisonment. He take advantage of the emperors' right to control aristocratic marriages to establish family ties between his lowborn favorites and the old aristocracy. George Mouzalon married a niece of Michael Palaiologos, [[Theodora Raoulaina|Theodora Kantakouzene Palaiologina]], his brother, Andronikos, wed a daughter of [[Alexios Raoul]].{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=159\u2013162, 169}}\n\nTheodore resumed negotiations about the [[church union]] in April or May 1256. He sent envoys to [[Pope Alexander IV]], offering his mediation between the Pope and the Patriarch. The Catholic and Orthodox Churches had adopted different views about the procession of the [[Holy Spirit in Christianity|Holy Spirit]]. Orthodox theologians maintained that the [[Eastern Orthodox teaching regarding the Filioque|Holy Spirit procceeded from the Father alone]], while Catholic theologians stated that the Holy Spirit proceeded from the [[God the Father|Father]] [[filioque|and the Son]]. Theodore commissioned Blemmydes to summarize the Orthodox position. Blemmydes adopted a conciliatory approach, saying that the Bible and the [[Church Fathers]] suggested that the Holy Spirit processed from the Father through the [[God the Son|Son]], but Theodore insisted on the traditional Orthodox doctrine. The Pope sent Constantine, [[Bishop of Orvieto]], as his legate to Theodore.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=162\u2013163}}\n\nMichael&nbsp;II of Bulgaria dispatched Cuman raiders to plunder Thrace early in 1256. Theodore had instructed Laskaris and Margarites to keep a defensive strategy. They ignored his instruction and chased the Cumans, who inflicted a heavy defeat on the Nicaean troops. Theodore assembled a new army, partially mustered among the Anatolian peasantry, and crossed the Hellespont. He sent troops, including Cuman horsemen in his service, against the invaders and the Nicaean troops defeated the enemy forces in two battles in Thrace. He entered into peace negotiations with Michael&nbsp;II with the mediation of [[Rostislav Mikhailovich]], [[Banate of Macs\u00f3|Duke of Macs\u00f3]]. Michael&nbsp;II had recently married Rostislav's daughter and Rostislav's wife, [[Anna of Hungary, Duchess of Macs\u00f3|Anna of Hungary]], was Theodore's cousin. Rostislav came to Thrace to reach an agreement with Theodore. Akropolites drafted a treaty about the restoration of the prewar boundaries between Nicaea and Bulgaria. Rostislav accepted it and signed the peace treaty on Michael&nbsp;II's behalf on 29 June. The treaty prescribed Michael&nbsp;II to cede Tzepaina to the Nicaeans, but the Bulgarian garrison was not withdrawn from the fortress. Theodore became convinced that Rostislav had deceived him and ordered the public whipping of Akropolites in a fit of anger. His act proved imprudent, because the Bulgarians ceded the fortress in early September.{{sfn|Fine|2009|p=159}}{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=164\u2013166}}\n\n===Triumphs===\n\nFrom Thrace, Theodore went to Thessalonica where he entered into negotiations with Michael&nbsp;II of Epirus's wife, [[Theodora of Arta|Theodora Petraliphaina]]. To secure a lasting peace with Nicaea and avoid imprisonment, she agreed to cede [[Servia, Greece|Servia]] and [[Dyrrachium]] to Theodore, establishing the Nicaean control of the [[Via Egnatia]]. Theodore married off his daughter, Maria to the heir to the Epirote throne, [[Nikephoros I Komnenos Doukas|Nikephoros Komnenos Doukas]], in October, but his territorial demands alienated Michael&nbsp;II.{{sfn|Nicol|1993|p=28}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1997|p=721}}{{sfn|Fine|2009|p=160}} Theodore also received the papal legate, but their negotiations proved fruitless and Constantine of Orvieto died during his journey back to Italy.

On learning of the Mongol invasion, Theodore hurried back to Anatolia. Kaykaus sought asylum in Nicaea and the Mongols installed his brother, [[Kilij Arslan IV]], as the new sultan of Rum. Theodore assembled his troops on the plains near [[Magnesia on the Maeander|Magnesia]]. The Mongol ruler of Persia, the [[Ilkhan (title)|Ilkhan]] [[Hulagu Khan|H\u00fclag\u00fc]] sent an embassy to Theodore and he persuaded the Ilkhan to withdraw his army from Anatolia. H\u00fcleg\u00fc also allowed Kaykaus to return to Rum, ordering the division of the sultanate between Kaykaus and his brother in the spring of 1257. Theodore concluded an agreement with Kaykaus who ceded four fortresses in the valley of the river [[Lycus (river of Phrygia)|Lycus]] to him in return for a contingent of 300 auxiliary troops from Nicaea.{{sfn|Korobeinikov|2017|pp=721\u2013722}}{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=169\u2013171}}\n\nBulgaria fell into a state of anarchy. Michael&nbsp;II was dethroned by his cousin, [[Kaliman Asen II of Bulgaria|Kaliman&nbsp;II]], but Kaliman was murdered by [[boyar]]s (or noblemen). Rostislav Mikhailovich and Michael&nbsp;II's brother-in-law, [[Mitso Asen of Bulgaria|Mitso]], laid claim to the throne, but most boyars offered their allegiance to one of their number, [[Konstantin Tih]], although he was not related to the [[Asen dynasty]]. Theodore's daughters by Elena were Tzar Ivan Asen&nbsp;II's granddaughters. Konstantin reputiated his wife and sued for the hand of Theodore's eldest daughter, [[Irene Doukaina Laskarina|Irene]].

He proadly stated that his empire included territories as far as Dyrrachium on the [[Adriatic Sea]] and [[Do\u011fanyurt|Cape Karambis]] on the [[Black Sea]]. His success during the war against Bulgaria had convinced him that he should recruit soldiers from among Anatolian peasants. In a letter to Blemmydes, he stated that the \"Hellenes\" were more reliable than foreign mercenaries. Theodore fell seriously ill in November 1257. [[George Pachymeres]], who was less than sixteen around that time, diagnozed his illness as epilepsy. Akropolites and Blemmydes did not mention epilepsy. Akropolites only mentioned that Theodore lost weight and \"his entire body was reduced to a skeleton\". In a letter to Blemmydes, Theodore wrote of insufferable aching and paralysis in the arm. His illness cannot identified certainly, but it could be epilepsy of the grand-mal type or cancer of the brain, the spine or the lungs. He could no more command his troops personally.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=172\u2013174, 176, 381\u2013383}} \n\nIn Macedonia, Theodore had dismissed the commanders of noble origin with close family ties to the local aristocracy with Anatolian officers of humble origin. His appointees, however, could not resist after Michael&nbsp;II of Epirus had incited the local Albanian chiefs to a rebellion in late 1256. He also made an alliance with [[Stefan Uro\u0161 I]], [[King of Serbia]], who intervened in the conflict and defeated Theodore's local commander, Xyleas, near [[Prilep]]. An other newly appointed Nicaean commander, [[Constantine Chabaron]], was trapped, allegedly through love letters that Michael&nbsp;II's sister-in-law, Maria Petraliphina, had sent to him. Theodore sent an army of peasant soldiers to Macedonia, but they were routed at [[Edessa|Edessa, Greece]]. Michael Palaiologos, who had been allowed to return from his exile, lead a new army to Macedonia. He defeated the Epirotes, but Theodore ordered him to return instead of marching to Prilep. Palaiologos' withdrawal enabled Michael&nbsp;II to seize Prilep and capture Akropolites. Michael&nbsp;II was planning to launch an attack against Thessalonica, but Emperor Frederick&nbsp;II's illegitimate son, [[Manfred, King of Sicily|Manfred]], who had taken control of the [[Kingdom of Sicily]] after the death of his stepbrother, Conrad, invaded Epirus from the west. Michael&nbsp;II who did not want to abandon his plan concluded an alliance with Manfred. Manfred captured Dyrrachium and other fortresses on the Adriatic by the end of February 1258.{{sfn|Nicol|1993|p=28}}{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=175\u2013176}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1997|p=722}}{{sfn|Fine|2009|p=161}}\n\nTheodore rarely left his palace at Magnesia during the last months of his life. He became convinced that sorcery had caused his illness. Theodore had forced Michael Palaiologos's niece, Theodore to marry the elderly Basil Kaballarios. The marriage was never consummated and Kaballarios accused Theodora's, Maria-Martha Palaiologna, of witchcraft. She was publicly humilated and tortured. Although she did not confess, Theodore ordered the imprisonment of her brother, Michael Palaiologos, for a while. Theodore named his seven-year-old son, [[John IV Laskaris|John]], as his sole heir, appointing George Mouzalon regent until John came of age. He became a monk, but he kept his baptismal name. He summarized his sins in a treatise and asked the patriarchal synod to grant him absolution. He died in the imperial palace at Magnesia on 16 August 1258. He was buried next to his father in the Sosandra monastery on [[Mount Sipylus]]. His grave and the monastery was destroyed after the Turkish conquest of the region in the 13th&nbsp;century.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=178\u2013180}}\n\nThe aristocrats had taken an oath of loyalty to Mouzalon at Theodore's deathbed, but they soon began conspiring against him. In ten days, Mouzalon was murdered and Michael Palaiologos assumed the regency for the child-emperor, John&nbsp;IV Laskaris. Palaiologos convinced the aristocrats that an empire ruled by a boy could not resist enemy attacks and he was proclaimed emperor as Michael&nbsp;VIII before the end of the year. Early in 1259, Michael&nbsp;VIII and John&nbsp;IV were crowned together. The Patriarch put the crown first on Michael&nbsp;VIII's head. After concluding an agreement with Genoa against the Latin Empire, he dispatched Alexios Strategopoulos to spy out the defences of Constantinople. Taking advantage of the absence of the bulk of the Latin army, Strategopoulos seized Constantinople by a surprise attack on 25 July 1261.

Michael Angold explains this as in part, a matter of his temperament:\n: He [Theodore] was happier in the company of a cultivated circle of friends, some of whom had been his childhood companions (''paidopoula''). He clearly disliked what he considered the philistinism prevalent among a section of the young men at his father's court.<ref>Angold, ''A Byzantine Government in Exile: Government and Society Under the Laskarids of Nicaea (1204-1261)'' (Oxford: University Press, 1975), p. 76</ref>\n\n==Scholarship==\n\nTheodore was a scholar and transformed his court into a center of a scholars.

She was born to Ivan Asen&nbsp;II and [[Anna Maria of Hungary|Maria of Hungary]] in 1224. The wedding took place at Lampsakos early in 1235. Two years later, before launching an invasion of Nicaean territories in Thrace, her father forced Elena to return to Bulgaria, but peace was restored between the two empires and Elena returned to Theodore before the end of the year.

Both oil ministers were angered by the price cuts, and the two led their fellow delegates to establish the Maadi Pact or Gentlemen's Agreement, calling for an \"Oil Consultation Commission\" of exporting countries, to which MOCs should present price-change plans. Jablonski reported a marked hostility toward the West and a growing outcry against \"[[absentee landlord]]ism\" of the MOCs, which at the time controlled all oil operations within the exporting countries and wielded enormous political influence.

With only 10 hostages remaining, Carlos held a phone conversation with Algerian President [[Houari Boum\u00e9dienne]], who informed Carlos that the oil ministers' deaths would result in an attack on the plane. Boum\u00e9dienne must also have offered Carlos asylum at this time and possibly financial compensation for failing to complete his assignment.

They also claimed that the idea and funding came from an Arab president, widely thought to be [[Muammar al-Gaddafi]] of Libya, itself an OPEC member. Fellow militants [[Bassam Abu Sharif]] and Klein claimed that Carlos received and kept a ransom between US$20&nbsp;million and US$50&nbsp;million from \"an Arab president\".

One thing is for sure: Current prices [roughly US$60/bbl] do not support all producers.</blockquote>\n\nA year later, when OPEC met in Vienna on 4 December 2015, the organization had exceeded its production ceiling for 18 consecutive months, US oil production had declined only slightly from its peak, world markets appeared to be oversupplied by at least 2 million barrels per day despite [[Libyan Civil War (2014\u2013present)|war-torn Libya]] pumping 1 million barrels below capacity, oil producers were making major adjustments to withstand prices as low as the $40s, Indonesia was rejoining the export organization, Iraqi production had surged after years of disorder, Iranian output was poised to rebound with the lifting of [[Sanctions against Iran|international sanctions]], hundreds of world leaders at the [[Paris Climate Agreement]] were committing to limit carbon emissions from fossil fuels, and [[Solar power#Economics|solar technologies]] were becoming steadily more competitive and prevalent. In light of all these market pressures, OPEC decided to set aside its ineffective production ceiling until the next ministerial conference in June 2016.<ref name=FT2015>{{cite news |url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/1f84e444-9ceb-11e5-8ce1-f6219b685d74.html |title=OPEC discord fuels further oil price drop |newspaper=The Financial Times |date=7 December 2015}}</ref><ref name=glut>{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-12-04/opec-maintains-crude-production-as-group-defers-output-target-ihryzilb |title=OPEC Won't Cut Production to Stop Oil's Slump |first1=Grant |last1=Smith |first2=Angelina |last2=Rascouet |first3=Wael |last3=Mahdi |publisher=Bloomberg News |date=4 December 2015 |access-date=10 March 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170328111428/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-12-04/opec-maintains-crude-production-as-group-defers-output-target-ihryzilb |archive-date=28 March 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.eia.gov/beta/international/analysis_includes/countries_long/Libya/libya.pdf |title=Country Analysis Brief: Libya |publisher=US Energy Information Administration |date=19 November 2015 |accessdate=22 May 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151223160212/http://www.eia.gov/beta/international/analysis_includes/countries_long/Libya/libya.pdf |archive-date=23 December 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/05/business/energy-environment/opec-meeting-oil-production-price.html |title=Despite Climate Concerns, OPEC Plans to Keep Pumping Oil While It Can |newspaper=The New York Times |date=5 December 2015 |access-date=11 February 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170128123133/https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/05/business/energy-environment/opec-meeting-oil-production-price.html |archive-date=28 January 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.argusmedia.com/pages/NewsBody.aspx?id=1148950&menu=yes |title=OPEC ceiling falls in |publisher=Argus Media |date=7 December 2015 |access-date=7 December 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208105422/http://www.argusmedia.com/pages/NewsBody.aspx?id=1148950&menu=yes |archive-date=8 December 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-01-02/iran-says-post-sanctions-crude-output-boost-won-t-hurt-prices |title=Iran Says Post-Sanctions Crude Output Boost Won't Hurt Prices |first1=Hashem |last1=Kalantari |first2=Mohammed |last2=Sergie |publisher=Bloomberg News |date=2 January 2016 |accessdate=18 April 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160115230602/http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-01-02/iran-says-post-sanctions-crude-output-boost-won-t-hurt-prices |archive-date=15 January 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref> By 20 January 2016, the OPEC Reference Basket was down to US$22.48/bbl \u2013 less than one-fourth of its high from June 2014 ($110.48), less than one-sixth of its record from July 2008 ($140.73), and back below the April 2003 starting point ($23.27) of its historic run-up.<ref name=basketprice>{{cite web |url=http://www.opec.org/basket/basketDayArchives.xml |title=OPEC Basket Daily Archives |work=OPEC |accessdate=21 January 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160121231540/http://www.opec.org/basket/basketDayArchives.xml |archive-date=21 January 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nAs 2016 continued, the oil glut was partially trimmed with significant production offline in the US, Canada, Libya, Nigeria and China, and the basket price gradually rose back into the $40s.

Despite many political obstacles, a September 2016 decision to trim approximately 1 million barrels per day was codified by a new quota-agreement at the November 2016 OPEC conference. The agreement (which exempted disruption-ridden members Libya and Nigeria) covered the first half of 2017 \u2013 alongside promised reductions from Russia and ten other non-members, offset by expected increases in the US shale-sector, Libya, Nigeria, [[#Spare capacity|spare capacity]], and surging late-2016 OPEC production before the cuts took effect. Indonesia announced another \"temporary suspension\" of its OPEC membership rather than accepting the organization's requested 5-percent production-cut. Prices fluctuated around US$50/bbl, and in May 2017 OPEC decided to extend the new quotas through March 2018, with the world waiting to see if and how the oil-inventory glut might be fully siphoned-off by then.<ref name=LeavingAgain/><ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-11-30/opec-decision-day-as-ministers-meet-to-salvage-deal-on-oil-cuts | title= OPEC Agrees to Cut Production in Drive to End Record Glut | publisher= Bloomberg News | date= 30 November 2016 |access-date= 30 November 2016 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20161201020159/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-11-30/opec-decision-day-as-ministers-meet-to-salvage-deal-on-oil-cuts |archive-date= 1 December 2016 |url-status= live }}</ref><ref>{{cite press release |url= http://www.opec.org/opec_web/en/press_room/3912.htm |title= OPEC 171st Meeting concludes |work=OPEC |date=30 November 2016 |access-date=30 November 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161201015438/http://www.opec.org/opec_web/en/press_room/3912.htm |archive-date=1 December 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-10-20/the-world-s-biggest-oil-kingdom-reverses-course |title=The World's Biggest Oil Kingdom Reverses Course |first=Javier |last=Blas |publisher=Bloomberg News |date=20 October 2016 |access-date=10 March 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170406180755/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-10-20/the-world-s-biggest-oil-kingdom-reverses-course |archive-date=6 April 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.ft.com/content/01ab26c7-3af5-3c54-96fd-8237d66e17c6 |title=OPEC agrees on need for output cut |first=Neil |last=Hume |newspaper=The Financial Times |date=28 September 2016 |access-date=28 September 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160928201057/https://www.ft.com/content/01ab26c7-3af5-3c54-96fd-8237d66e17c6 |archive-date=28 September 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-12-11/russian-energy-minister-says-oil-output-cuts-to-start-in-january |title=Russian Energy Minister Says Oil Cuts to Start in January |publisher=Bloomberg News |date=11 December 2016 |access-date=12 December 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161213115632/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-12-11/russian-energy-minister-says-oil-output-cuts-to-start-in-january |archive-date=13 December 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=May2017Vienna/> Longtime oil analyst [[Daniel Yergin]] \"described the relationship between OPEC and shale as 'mutual coexistence', with both sides learning to live with prices that are lower than they would like.\"<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-03-07/opec-said-to-break-bread-with-shale-in-rare-show-of-detente |title=OPEC Said to Break Bread With Shale in Rare Show of Detente |publisher=Bloomberg News |date=7 March 2017 |access-date=8 March 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170307220233/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-03-07/opec-said-to-break-bread-with-shale-in-rare-show-of-detente |archive-date=7 March 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> These production cut deals with non-OPEC countries are generally referred to{{by whom?|date=April 2020}} as '''OPEC+'''.<ref>{{cite web |title=Where OPEC+ Oil Production Stands Now -

Weeks later, the [[Arab League]]'s first [[Arab Petroleum Congress]] convened in Cairo, Egypt, where the influential journalist [[Wanda Jablonski]] introduced Saudi Arabia's [[Abdullah Tariki]] to Venezuela's observer [[Juan Pablo P\u00e9rez Alfonzo]], representing the two then-largest oil-producing nations outside the United States and the Soviet Union. Both oil ministers were angered by the price cuts, and the two led their fellow delegates to establish the Maadi Pact or Gentlemen's Agreement, calling for an \"Oil Consultation Commission\" of exporting countries, to which MOCs should present price-change plans. Jablonski reported a marked hostility toward the West and a growing outcry against \"[[absentee landlord]]ism\" of the MOCs, which at the time controlled all oil operations within the exporting countries and wielded enormous political influence. In August 1960, ignoring the warnings, and with the US favoring Canadian and Mexican oil for strategic reasons, the MOCs again unilaterally announced significant cuts in their posted prices for Middle Eastern crude oil.<ref name=\"open\"/><ref name=\"prize\">{{cite book |first=Daniel |last=Yergin |authorlink=Daniel Yergin |title=The Prize: The Epic Quest for Oil, Money, and Power |location=New York |publisher=Simon & Schuster |year=1991 |isbn=978-0671502485 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/prize00dani/page/499 499\u2013503] |title-link=The Prize: The Epic Quest for Oil, Money, and Power }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Painter |first=David S. |year=2012 |title=Oil and the American Century |url=http://jah.oxfordjournals.org/content/99/1/24.full.pdf |journal=[[The Journal of American History]] |volume=99 |issue=1 |pages=24\u201339 |doi=10.1093/jahist/jas073 |access-date=4 May 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141010181915/http://jah.oxfordjournals.org/content/99/1/24.full.pdf |archive-date=10 October 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bBvz_YxlB-AC&pg=PA7 |title=Historical Dictionary of the Petroleum Industry |first=M.S. |last=Vassiliou |publisher=Scarecrow Press |year=2009 |isbn=978-0810862883 |page=7}}</ref>\n\n===1960\u20131975 founding and expansion===\n[[File:Opec Geb\u00e4ude Wien Helferstorferstra\u00dfe 17.jpg|thumb|alt=refer to caption|OPEC headquarters in Vienna<br />(2009 building)]]\nThe following month, during 10\u201314 September 1960, the Baghdad Conference was held at the initiative of Tariki, P\u00e9rez Alfonzo, and Iraqi prime minister [[Abd al-Karim Qasim]], whose country had skipped the 1959 congress.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8U_sWfvgToQC&pg=PA74 |last=Styan |first=David |title=France and Iraq: Oil, Arms and French Policy Making in the Middle East |publisher=I.B.

Despite many political obstacles, a September 2016 decision to trim approximately 1 million barrels per day was codified by a new quota-agreement at the November 2016 OPEC conference. The agreement (which exempted disruption-ridden members Libya and Nigeria) covered the first half of 2017 \u2013 alongside promised reductions from Russia and ten other non-members, offset by expected increases in the US shale-sector, Libya, Nigeria, [[#Spare capacity|spare capacity]], and surging late-2016 OPEC production before the cuts took effect. Indonesia announced another \"temporary suspension\" of its OPEC membership rather than accepting the organization's requested 5-percent production-cut. Prices fluctuated around US$50/bbl, and in May 2017 OPEC decided to extend the new quotas through March 2018, with the world waiting to see if and how the oil-inventory glut might be fully siphoned-off by then.<ref name=LeavingAgain/><ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-11-30/opec-decision-day-as-ministers-meet-to-salvage-deal-on-oil-cuts | title= OPEC Agrees to Cut Production in Drive to End Record Glut | publisher= Bloomberg News | date= 30 November 2016 |access-date= 30 November 2016 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20161201020159/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-11-30/opec-decision-day-as-ministers-meet-to-salvage-deal-on-oil-cuts |archive-date= 1 December 2016 |url-status= live }}</ref><ref>{{cite press release |url= http://www.opec.org/opec_web/en/press_room/3912.htm |title= OPEC 171st Meeting concludes |work=OPEC |date=30 November 2016 |access-date=30 November 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161201015438/http://www.opec.org/opec_web/en/press_room/3912.htm |archive-date=1 December 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-10-20/the-world-s-biggest-oil-kingdom-reverses-course |title=The World's Biggest Oil Kingdom Reverses Course |first=Javier |last=Blas |publisher=Bloomberg News |date=20 October 2016 |access-date=10 March 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170406180755/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-10-20/the-world-s-biggest-oil-kingdom-reverses-course |archive-date=6 April 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.ft.com/content/01ab26c7-3af5-3c54-96fd-8237d66e17c6 |title=OPEC agrees on need for output cut |first=Neil |last=Hume |newspaper=The Financial Times |date=28 September 2016 |access-date=28 September 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160928201057/https://www.ft.com/content/01ab26c7-3af5-3c54-96fd-8237d66e17c6 |archive-date=28 September 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-12-11/russian-energy-minister-says-oil-output-cuts-to-start-in-january |title=Russian Energy Minister Says Oil Cuts to Start in January |publisher=Bloomberg News |date=11 December 2016 |access-date=12 December 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161213115632/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-12-11/russian-energy-minister-says-oil-output-cuts-to-start-in-january |archive-date=13 December 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=May2017Vienna/> Longtime oil analyst [[Daniel Yergin]] \"described the relationship between OPEC and shale as 'mutual coexistence', with both sides learning to live with prices that are lower than they would like.\"<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-03-07/opec-said-to-break-bread-with-shale-in-rare-show-of-detente |title=OPEC Said to Break Bread With Shale in Rare Show of Detente |publisher=Bloomberg News |date=7 March 2017 |access-date=8 March 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170307220233/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-03-07/opec-said-to-break-bread-with-shale-in-rare-show-of-detente |archive-date=7 March 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> These production cut deals with non-OPEC countries are generally referred to{{by whom?|date=April 2020}} as '''OPEC+'''.<ref>{{cite web |title=Where OPEC+ Oil Production Stands Now -

{"title_page": "Parable of the Faithful Servant", "text_new": "[[File:Teachings of Jesus 32 of 40. the faithful and wise steward. Jan Luyken etching. Bowyer Bible.gif|thumb|300px|Etching by [[Jan Luyken]] illustrating the parable, from the [[Bowyer Bible]].]]\n\nThe '''Parable of the Faithful Servant''' (or '''Parable of the Door Keeper''') is a [[parable of Jesus]] found in [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 24:42-51, [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]] 13:34-37, and [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] 12:35-48 about how it is important for the faithful to keep watch.\n\nIn Matthew's Gospel, it immediately precedes the [[Parable of the Ten Virgins]], which has a similar [[Christian eschatology|eschatological]] theme of being prepared for the day of reckoning.\n\n== Narrative ==\nIn Luke's Gospel, the parable reads as follows:\n\n{{quotation|\"Let your waist be dressed and your lamps burning. Be like men watching for their lord, when he returns from the marriage feast; that, when he comes and knocks, they may immediately open to him. Blessed are those servants, whom the lord will find watching when he comes. Most certainly I tell you, that he will dress himself, and make them recline, and will come and serve them. They will be blessed if he comes in the second or third watch, and finds them so. But know this, that if the master of the house had known in what hour the thief was coming, he would have watched, and not allowed his house to be broken into. Therefore be ready also, for the Son of Man is coming in an hour that you don't expect him.\"\n\n[[Saint Peter|Peter]] said to him, \"Lord, are you telling this parable to us, or to everybody?\"\n\nThe Lord said, \"Who then is the faithful and wise steward, whom his lord will set over his household, to give them their portion of food at the right times? Blessed is that servant whom his lord will find doing so when he comes. Truly I tell you, that he will set him over all that he has. But if that servant says in his heart, 'My lord delays his coming,' and begins to beat the menservants and the maidservants, and to eat and drink, and to be drunken, then the lord of that servant will come in a day when he isn't expecting him, and in an hour that he doesn't know, and will cut him in two, and place his portion with the unfaithful. That servant, who knew his lord's will, and didn't prepare, nor do what he wanted, will be beaten with many stripes, but he who didn't know, and did things worthy of stripes, will be beaten with few stripes. To whomever much is given, of him will much be required; and to whom much was entrusted, of him more will be asked.|Luke 12:35-48, [[World English Bible]]}}\n\n==Interpretation==\nIn Matthew, the parable opens with the injunction: \"Therefore keep watch, because you do not know on what day your Lord will come\" (Matthew 24:42). In other words, \"the disciple must remain prepared for his Lord's coming, remaining alert and awake at his post.\"<ref name=\"CSK\">Craig S.

Jan Luyken etching. Bowyer Bible.gif|thumb|300px|Etching by [[Jan Luyken]] illustrating the parable, from the [[Bowyer Bible]].]]\n\nThe '''Parable of the Faithful Servant''' (or '''Parable of the Door Keeper''') is a [[parable of Jesus]] found in [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 24:42-51, [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]] 13:34-37, and [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] 12:35-48 about how it is important for the faithful to keep watch.\n\nIn Matthew's Gospel, it immediately precedes the [[Parable of the Ten Virgins]], which has a similar [[Christian eschatology|eschatological]] theme of being prepared for the day of reckoning.\n\n== Narrative ==\nIn Luke's Gospel, the parable reads as follows:\n\n{{quotation|\"Let your waist be dressed and your lamps burning. Be like men watching for their lord, when he returns from the marriage feast; that, when he comes and knocks, they may immediately open to him. Blessed are those servants, whom the lord will find watching when he comes. Most certainly I tell you, that he will dress himself, and make them recline, and will come and serve them. They will be blessed if he comes in the second or third watch, and finds them so. But know this, that if the master of the house had known in what hour the thief was coming, he would have watched, and not allowed his house to be broken into. Therefore be ready also, for the Son of Man is coming in an hour that you don't expect him.\"\n\n[[Saint Peter|Peter]] said to him, \"Lord, are you telling this parable to us, or to everybody?\"\n\nThe Lord said, \"Who then is the faithful and wise steward, whom his lord will set over his household, to give them their portion of food at the right times? Blessed is that servant whom his lord will find doing so when he comes. Truly I tell you, that he will set him over all that he has. But if that servant says in his heart, 'My lord delays his coming,' and begins to beat the menservants and the maidservants, and to eat and drink, and to be drunken, then the lord of that servant will come in a day when he isn't expecting him, and in an hour that he doesn't know, and will cut him in two, and place his portion with the unfaithful. That servant, who knew his lord's will, and didn't prepare, nor do what he wanted, will be beaten with many stripes, but he who didn't know, and did things worthy of stripes, will be beaten with few stripes. To whomever much is given, of him will much be required; and to whom much was entrusted, of him more will be asked.|Luke 12:35-48, [[World English Bible]]}}\n\n==Interpretation==\nIn Matthew, the parable opens with the injunction: \"Therefore keep watch, because you do not know on what day your Lord will come\" (Matthew 24:42). In other words, \"the disciple must remain prepared for his Lord's coming, remaining alert and awake at his post.\"<ref name=\"CSK\">Craig S.

The land the Liberty National lies upon has a unique and storied history including an ammunition depot during World War I, and a prisoner of war camp during World War II, and more recently as an oil refinery and warehouse for industrial goods.

As the family business declined, Fireman sought new opportunities. \n\nWhile attending a sporting goods show in Chicago in 1979 Fireman met Joe Foster, the owner of a British running shoe company founded in 1895 called Reebok.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/reebok-cofounder-shares-3-rules-for-startup-success-2017-4|title=Reebok co-founder shares 3 rules for startup success|last=Johnson|first=Kieron|website=Business Insider|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref> Fireman acquired the North American sales rights to [[Reebok]] in 1979 and eventually bought the British-based parent company outright in 1984.<ref name=\"lat\" /><ref name=\"healy\" /> Reebok capitalized on the increasing popularity of aerobics in California and introduced the world\u2019s first aerobic shoe designed specifically for women in 1982 called Freestyle. Riding the success of the Freestyle shoe as the aerobics craze swept across America, Fireman grew the company and Reebok issued an [[Initial Public Offering|IPO]] in 1985.<ref name=\"lat\" /> In 1986, Reebok surpassed Nike as the top-selling manufacturer of athletic shoes in the United States, second only in the world to Adidas. Starting in 1986, Reebok acquired several companies to create a multinational corporation, including Avia, a rival athletic shoemaker; John A. Frye, the prestigious and stylish boot maker; Rockport, a company known for its sporting and casual shoes; and Ellesse, an Italian company known for making expensive athletic shoes and clothing.

He worked diligently to improve human rights worldwide. In 1986, Reebok became one of the first companies to pull out of South Africa because of the country's practice of apartheid and two years later Reebok sponsored the Amnesty International Human Rights Now tour. Fireman subsequently established the annual Reebok Human Rights Awards in 1988 recognizing activists under the age of 30 who exposed and reduced human rights atrocities.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Fireman|first=Paul|title=From the Pain Come the Dream: The Recipients of the Reebok Human Rights Award|publisher=Umbrage|year=2003|isbn=1884167357|location=New York|pages=}}</ref>\n\nFireman sold Reebok to [[Adidas]] in 2005.<ref name=\"healy\">{{cite news|last1=Healy|first1=Beth|title=Paul Fireman takes another shot|url=http://www.boston.com/business/articles/2011/06/10/reebok_founder_fireman_returns_to_sneaker_business_with_20m_stake_in_colorado_firm/|accessdate=18 October 2015|publisher=The Boston Globe|date=10 June 2011}}</ref> He is currently the Chairman of Fireman Capital Partners, a Boston-based, consumer-focused private equity firm founded in 2008 with his son Dan, the firm\u2019s Managing Partner.<ref name=\"healy\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.firemancapital.com/team/dan-fireman/|title=Dan Fireman {{!}} Fireman Capital Partners {{!}} Boston Massachusetts|website=www.firemancapital.com|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref> \n\n==Golf Course Development==\n\nFireman has been active in golf course development and in 1991 he purchased Willowbend Country Club ([[Mashpee, Massachusetts|Mashpee, MA]]).

In 1995 Fireman purchased a mile of neglected and decaying New Jersey shoreline along the Hudson River that was an eyesore. The land the Liberty National lies upon has a unique and storied history including an ammunition depot during World War I, and a prisoner of war camp during World War II, and more recently as an oil refinery and warehouse for industrial goods. However, the land when Fireman originally toured the site was \u201ca toxic moonscape of corroded oil tanks, contaminated soil, and rusting warehouses.\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/2009/07/24/golf-barclays-pga-lifestyle-sports-golf-liberty-national.html|title=Inside A $250 Million Golf Course|last=Bertoni|first=Steven|website=Forbes|language=en|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref> \u201cI loved the site and the historical value with the Statue of Liberty, and the city, and it was on the water,\u201d Fireman says. \u201cI just plunged into it because I thought it would be a phenomenal golf site and improve the world.

Liberty National also hosts junior golf tournaments, the First Tee of New Jersey, and local high school golf teams from Jersey City practice and play their home matches at the course.  \n\n==Philanthropy==\n\nThe Paul and Phyllis Fireman Charitable Foundation was created in 1985.<ref>{{Cite web|url=www.ppffound.org/about/|title=The Paul and Phyllis Fireman Charitable Foundation|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Since its inception, the foundation has distributed over $165 million to charitable organizations with a focus primarily on improving the communities of both Massachusetts and New Jersey.\n\nAddressing homelessness has been a major initiative of the foundation.

After achieving success as a songwriter for others, Parton made her album debut in 1967 with ''[[Hello, I'm Dolly]]''. With steady success during the remainder of the 1960s (both as a solo artist and with a series of duet albums with [[Porter Wagoner]]), her sales and chart peak came during the 1970s and continued into the 1980s. Parton's albums in the 1990s did not sell as well, but she achieved commercial success again in the new millennium and has released albums on various independent labels since 2000, including her own label, Dolly Records.\n\nParton's music includes 25 [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA)-certified gold, platinum and multi-platinum awards. She has had 25 songs reach No. 1 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' country music charts, a record for a female artist (tied with [[Reba McEntire]]). She has 41 career top-10 country albums, a record for any artist, and she has 110 career charted singles over the past 40 years. She has garnered ten [[Grammy Award]]s, two [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations, ten [[Country Music Association Awards]], seven [[Academy of Country Music Awards]], three [[American Music Awards]], and is one of only seven female artists to win the Country Music Association's Entertainer of the Year Award. Parton has received 47 Grammy nominations.\n\nIn 1999, Parton was inducted into the [[Country Music Hall of Fame]]. She has composed over 3,000 songs, including \"[[I Will Always Love You]]\" (a two-time U.S. country chart-topper, as well as an international pop hit for [[Whitney Houston]]), \"[[Jolene (song)|Jolene]]\", \"[[Coat of Many Colors (song)|Coat of Many Colors]]\", and \"[[9 to 5 (Dolly Parton song)|9 to 5]]\". She is also [[List of people who have won Academy, Emmy, Grammy, and Tony Awards#Four nominations|one of the few]] to have received at least one nomination from the Academy Awards, Grammy Awards, [[Tony Awards]], and [[Emmy Awards]]. As an actress, she has starred in films such as ''[[9 to 5 (film)|9 to 5]]'' (1980) and ''[[The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas (film)|The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas]]'' (1982), for which she earned [[Golden Globe]] nominations for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress \u2013 Motion Picture Comedy or Musical|Best Actress]], as well as ''[[Rhinestone (film)|Rhinestone]]'' (1984), ''[[Steel Magnolias]]'' (1989), ''[[Straight Talk]]'' (1992) and ''[[Joyful Noise (film)|Joyful Noise]]'' (2012).\n\n==Early life and career==\nDolly Rebecca Parton was born January 19, 1946, in a one-room cabin on the banks of the [[Little Pigeon River (Tennessee)|Little Pigeon River]] in [[Pittman Center, Tennessee|Pittman Center]], a very small community in [[Sevier County, Tennessee|Sevier County]] in the [[Great Smoky Mountains]] of [[East Tennessee]].{{sfn|Parton|1994}}<ref>{{cite book|last=Schmidt|first=Randy L.

Her father, known as \"Lee\", worked in the mountains of East Tennessee, first as a [[sharecropper]] and later tending his own small tobacco farm and acreage. He also worked construction jobs to supplement the farm's small income. Mr. Parton was illiterate but Dolly Parton often says despite that fact, he was one of the smartest people she's known in regards to business and making a profit.<ref>{{cite web|title=Daddy's Dinner Bucket: Mr. Lee Parton|url=http://dollyparton.com/front-porch-stories/daddys-dinner-bucket-lee-parton/|publisher=DollyParton.com|access-date=July 9, 2018}}</ref>{{sfn|Parton|1994}}<ref name=\"belfasttelegraphifightilliteracy\">{{cite news|title=Dolly Parton: 'I fight illiteracy for my father'|url=https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/entertainment/news/dolly-parton-i-fight-illiteracy-for-my-father-35185084.html|access-date=July 3, 2018|work=Belfast Telegraph|date=November 3, 2016}}</ref> Avie Lee was homemaker for the large family. Her 11 pregnancies (the tenth being twins) in 20 years made her a mother of 12 by age 35. Often in poor health, she still managed to keep house and entertain her children with songs and tales of mountain folklore. Avie Lee's father, Jake Owens, was a [[Pentecostal]] preacher, so Parton and her siblings all attended church regularly. Parton has long credited her father for her business savvy, and her mother's family for her musical abilities.{{sfn|Parton|1994}}\nWhile Dolly Parton was still very young, her family moved to a farm on nearby Locust Ridge. Most of her cherished memories of youth happened there, and it is the place about which she wrote the song \"[[My Tennessee Mountain Home (song)|My Tennessee Mountain Home]]\" in the 1970s.

She released a string of singles, but the only one that charted, \"Happy, Happy Birthday Baby\", did not crack the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. Although she expressed a desire to record country material, Monument resisted, thinking her unique voice with its strong vibrato was not suited to the genre.\n\nAfter her composition \"Put It Off Until Tomorrow\", as recorded by Bill Phillips (with Parton, uncredited, on harmony), went to number six on the country chart in 1966, the label relented and allowed her to record country. Her first country single, \"Dumb Blonde\" (composed by [[Curly Putman]], one of the few songs during this era that she recorded but did not write), reached number 24 on the country chart in 1967, followed by \"Something Fishy\", which went to number 17.

As documented in her 1994 autobiography,<ref name=allMusicGuide/> initially, much of Wagoner's audience was unhappy that [[Norma Jean (singer)|Norma Jean]], the performer whom Parton had replaced, had left the show, and was reluctant to accept Parton (sometimes chanting loudly for Norma Jean from the audience).<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.billboard.com/artist/301080/dolly-parton/biography|title=Dolly Parton-Biography|work=Billboard|access-date=May 18, 2013}}</ref> With Wagoner's assistance, however, Parton was eventually accepted. Wagoner convinced his label, [[RCA Victor]], to sign her. RCA decided to protect their investment by releasing her first single as a [[duet]] with Wagoner. That song, a remake of [[Tom Paxton]]'s \"[[The Last Thing on My Mind]]\", released in late 1967, reached the country top 10 in January 1968, launching a six-year streak of virtually uninterrupted top-10 singles for the pair.\n\nParton's first solo single for RCA Victor, \"[[Just Because I'm a Woman (1968 album)#Album information|Just Because I'm a Woman]]\", was released in the summer of 1968 and was a moderate chart hit, reaching number 17. For the remainder of the decade, none of her solo efforts \u2013 even \"[[In the Good Old Days (When Times Were Bad)]]\", which later became a standard \u2013 were as successful as her duets with Wagoner. The duo was named [[Country Music Association Awards|Vocal Group of the Year]] in 1968 by the [[Country Music Association]], but Parton's solo records were continually ignored. Wagoner had a significant financial stake in her future; as of 1969, he was her co-producer and owned nearly half of Owe-Par,<ref>{{cite web|title=Dolly and Uncle Bill Owens start Owe-Par Publishing Company|url=http://dollyparton.com/life-and-career/awards_milestones/owe-par-publishing-company/|publisher=DollyParton.com|access-date=June 14, 2015}}</ref> the publishing company Parton had founded with Bill Owens.\n\nBy 1970, both Parton and Wagoner had grown frustrated by her lack of solo chart success. Wagoner persuaded Parton to record [[Jimmie Rodgers (country singer)|Jimmie Rodgers]]' \"[[Mule Skinner Blues]]\", a [[gimmick]] that worked. The record shot to number three, followed closely, in February 1971, by her first number-one single, \"[[Joshua (song)|Joshua]]\". For the next two years, she had numerous solo hits \u2013 including her signature song \"[[Coat of Many Colors]]\" (number four, 1971) \u2013 in addition to her duets. Top-20 singles included \"The Right Combination\" and \"Burning the Midnight Oil\" (both duets with Wagoner, 1971); \"Lost Forever in Your Kiss\", (with Wagoner) \"[[Touch Your Woman]]\", (1972) \"[[My Tennessee Mountain Home]]\" and \"Travelin' Man\" (1973).<ref name=\"DollyPartonEntertainment.net\">{{cite web|url=http://www.dollypartonmusic.net|title=Dolly Parton Entertainment|access-date=October 7, 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150622025454/http://www.dollypartonmusic.net/|archive-date=June 22, 2015}}</ref>\n\nAlthough her solo singles and the Wagoner duets were successful, her biggest hit of this period was \"[[Jolene (song)|Jolene]]\". Released in late 1973, it topped the country chart in February 1974 and reached the lower regions of the Hot 100. (It eventually also charted in the U.K., reaching number seven in 1976, representing Parton's first U.K. success). Parton, who had always envisioned a solo career, made the decision to leave Wagoner's organization; the pair performed their last duet concert in April 1974, and she stopped appearing on his TV show in mid-1974, although they remained affiliated.

In a 2019 episode of the [[Sky Arts]] music series ''Brian Johnson: A Life on the Road'', Parton described finding old cassette tapes and realizing that she'd composed both \"Jolene\" and \"I Will Always Love You\" in the same songwriting session, telling Johnson \"Buddy, that was a good night.\" Parton again topped the singles chart in 1975 with \"[[The Bargain Store]]\".<ref>[http://www.dollymania.net/chartb.html On The Charts \u2013 The Singles], dollymania.net; accessed September 20, 2014.</ref>\n\n===1976\u20131986: Pop transition===\n[[File:Young-Dolly-Parton.jpg|thumb|upright|Parton in 1977]]\nFrom 1974 to 1980, she consistently charted in the country [[Top 40|Top 10]], with eight singles reaching number one.

Her siblings Randy and Stella both received recording contracts of their own.<ref name=allMusicGuide/>\n\nParton began to embark on a high-profile crossover campaign, attempting to aim her music in a more mainstream direction and increase her visibility outside of the confines of country music. In 1976, she began working closely with [[Sandy Gallin]], who served as her personal manager for the next 25 years. With her 1976 album ''[[All I Can Do (album)|All I Can Do]]'', which she co-produced with Porter Wagoner, Parton began taking more of an active role in production, and began specifically aiming her music in a more mainstream, pop direction. Her first entirely self-produced effort, ''[[New Harvest...First Gathering]]'' (1977), highlighted her pop sensibilities, both in terms of choice of songs \u2013 the album contained covers of the pop and R&B classics \"[[My Girl (The Temptations song)|My Girl]]\" and \"[[(Your Love Keeps Lifting Me) Higher and Higher|Higher and Higher]]\" \u2013 and production.<ref>{{cite web|title=New Harvest...First Gathering \u2013 18th Solo Album|url=http://dollyparton.com/life-and-career/music/new-harvest-first-gathering-album/|publisher=DollyParton.com|access-date=June 14, 2015}}</ref> Though the album was well received and topped the U.S. country albums chart, neither it nor its single \"[[Light of a Clear Blue Morning]]\" made much of an impression on the pop charts.\n\nAfter ''New Harvest'''s disappointing crossover performance, Parton turned to high-profile pop producer [[Gary Klein (producer)|Gary Klein]] for her next album. The result, 1977's ''[[Here You Come Again]],'' became her first million-seller, topping the country album chart and reaching number 20 on the pop chart. The [[Barry Mann]]-[[Cynthia Weil]]-penned [[Here You Come Again (song)|title track]] topped the country singles chart, and became Parton's first top-ten single on the pop chart (#3). A second single, the double A-sided \"[[Two Doors Down]]\"/\"[[It's All Wrong, But It's All Right]]\" topped the country chart and crossed over to the pop Top 20. For the remainder of the 1970s and into the early 1980s, many of her subsequent singles moved up on both charts simultaneously. Her albums during this period were developed specifically for pop-[[crossover (music)|crossover]] success.<ref>{{cite web|title=Dolly Parton's Official Song List|url=http://dollyparton.com/music-discography-song-list/|publisher=DollyParton.com|access-date=June 14, 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Dolly Parton and Burnett.jpg|thumb|upright|left|With [[Carol Burnett]], 1980]]\nIn 1978, Parton won a [[Grammy Award for Best Female Country Vocal Performance]] for her ''Here You Come Again'' album. She continued to have hits with \"[[Heartbreaker (Dolly Parton song)|Heartbreaker]]\", (1978) \"[[Baby I'm Burning]]\" (1979) and \"[[You're the Only One (Dolly Parton song)|You're the Only One]],\" (1979) all of which charted in the pop [[Top 40]] and topped the country chart. \"[[Sweet Summer Lovin']]\" (1979) became the first Parton single in two years to not top the country chart (though it did reach the Top 10). During this period, her visibility continued to increase, with multiple television appearances. A highly publicized candid interview on a ''[[Barbara Walters Special]]'' in 1977 (timed to coincide with ''Here You Come Again'''s release) was followed by appearances in 1978 on [[Cher]]'s ABC [[Cher... Special|television special]], and her own joint special with [[Carol Burnett]] on CBS, ''Carol and Dolly in Nashville''.\n\nParton served as one of three co-hosts (along with [[Roy Clark]] and [[Glen Campbell]]) on the CBS special ''Fifty Years of Country Music''. In 1979, Parton hosted the NBC special ''The Seventies: An Explosion of Country Music'', performed live at the [[Ford Theatre]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], and whose audience included President [[Jimmy Carter]].\nHer commercial success grew in 1980, with three consecutive country chart number-one hits: the [[Donna Summer]]-written \"[[Starting Over Again (Donna Summer song)|Starting Over Again]]\", \"[[Old Flames Can't Hold a Candle to You]]\", and \"[[9 to 5 (Dolly Parton song)|9 to 5]]\", which topped the country and pop charts in early 1981.<ref name=\"allMusicGuide\"/> She had another Top 10 single that year with \"Making Plans\", a single released from a 1980 [[Porter & Dolly|reunion album with Porter Wagoner]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Just Between Me And You compilation w/Porter Wagoner|url=http://dollyparton.com/life-and-career/music/just-between-you-and-me-compilation/|publisher=DollyParton.com|access-date=June 14, 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Dolly Parton 2.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Dolly Parton holding a baby in [[Honolulu]], [[Hawaii]], 1983]]\nThe theme song to the 1980 feature film ''[[9 to 5 (film)|9 to 5]]'', in which she starred along with [[Jane Fonda]] and [[Lily Tomlin]], \"9 to 5\", not only reached number one on the country chart, but also, in February 1981, reached number one on the pop and the [[adult contemporary music|adult-contemporary]] charts, giving her a triple number-one hit. Parton became one of the few female country singers to have a number-one single on the country and pop charts simultaneously. It also received a nomination for an [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]]. Her singles continued to appear consistently in the country Top 10. Between 1981 and 1985, she had 12 Top-10 hits; half of them hit number one. She continued to make inroads on the pop chart as well. A re-recorded version of \"I Will Always Love You,\" from the feature film ''[[The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas (film)|The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas]]'' (1982) scraped the Top 50 that year and her duet with [[Kenny Rogers]], \"[[Islands in the Stream (song)|Islands in the Stream]]\" (written by the [[Bee Gees]] and produced by [[Barry Gibb]]), spent two weeks at number one in 1983.<ref name=allMusicGuide/>\n\nIn the mid-1980s, her record sales were still relatively strong, with \"[[Save the Last Dance for Me]]\", \"[[Downtown (Petula Clark song)|Downtown]]\", \"[[Tennessee Homesick Blues]]\" (1984), \"[[Real Love (Dolly Parton and Kenny Rogers song)|Real Love]]\" (another duet with Kenny Rogers), \"[[Don't Call It Love]]\" (1985) and \"[[Think About Love]]\" (1986) all reaching the country Top 10 (\"Tennessee Homesick Blues\" and \"Think About Love\" reached number one; \"Real Love\" also reached number one on the country chart and became a modest crossover hit).

The album revitalized Parton's music career, spending five weeks at number one on ''Billboard's'' Country Albums chart, and also reached the top 10 on ''Billboard'''s Top-200 Albums chart. It sold several million copies and produced four Top 10 country hits, including [[Phil Spector]]'s \"[[To Know Him Is to Love Him]]\", which went to number one. ''Trio'' won the [[Grammy Award for Best Country Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal]] and was nominated for a [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year]]. After a further attempt at pop success with ''[[Rainbow (Dolly Parton album)|Rainbow]],'' (1987) including the single \"[[The River Unbroken]]\", Parton focused on recording country material. ''[[White Limozeen]]'' (1989) produced two number one hits in \"[[Why'd You Come in Here Lookin' Like That]]\" and \"[[Yellow Roses]]\". Although Parton's career appeared to be revived, it was actually just a brief revival before contemporary country music came in the early 1990s and moved most veteran artists off the charts.<ref name=allMusicGuide/>\n\n[[File:Dolly Parton with square red earrings.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Dolly Parton at a recording session ca 1989]]A duet with [[Ricky Van Shelton]], \"[[Rockin' Years]]\" (1991) reached number one, though Parton's greatest commercial fortune of the decade came when Whitney Houston recorded \"I Will Always Love You\" for the soundtrack of the feature film ''[[The Bodyguard (1992 film)|The Bodyguard]]'' (1992). Both the single and the album were massively successful. Parton's soundtrack album from the 1992 film, ''[[Straight Talk]]'', however, was less successful. But her 1993 album ''[[Slow Dancing with the Moon]]'' won critical acclaim and did well on the charts, reaching number four on the country albums chart, and number 16 on the ''Billboard'' 200 album chart. She recorded \"The Day I Fall in Love\" as a duet with [[James Ingram]] for the feature film ''[[Beethoven's 2nd (film)|Beethoven's 2nd]]'' (1993). The songwriters (Ingram, [[Carole Bayer Sager]], and [[Clif Magness]]) were nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Song, and Parton and Ingram performed the song at the awards telecast.

The following year, ''[[Treasures (Dolly Parton album)|Treasures]]'', an album of covers of 1960s/70s hits was released, and featured a diverse collection of material, including songs by [[Mac Davis]], [[Pete Seeger]], [[Kris Kristofferson]], [[Cat Stevens]], and [[Neil Young]]. Her recording of Stevens' \"[[Peace Train]]\" was later re-mixed and released as a dance single, reaching ''Billboard's ''dance singles chart. Her 1998 country-rock album ''[[Hungry Again]]'' was made up entirely of her own compositions.

After achieving success as a songwriter for others, Parton made her album debut in 1967 with ''[[Hello, I'm Dolly]]''. With steady success during the remainder of the 1960s (both as a solo artist and with a series of duet albums with [[Porter Wagoner]]), her sales and chart peak came during the 1970s and continued into the 1980s. Parton's albums in the 1990s did not sell as well, but she achieved commercial success again in the new millennium and has released albums on various independent labels since 2000, including her own label, Dolly Records.\n\nParton's music includes 25 [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA)-certified gold, platinum and multi-platinum awards. She has had 25 songs reach No. 1 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' country music charts, a record for a female artist (tied with [[Reba McEntire]]). She has 41 career top-10 country albums, a record for any artist, and she has 110 career charted singles over the past 40 years. She has garnered ten [[Grammy Award]]s, two [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations, ten [[Country Music Association Awards]], seven [[Academy of Country Music Awards]], three [[American Music Awards]], and is one of only seven female artists to win the Country Music Association's Entertainer of the Year Award. Parton has received 47 Grammy nominations.\n\nIn 1999, Parton was inducted into the [[Country Music Hall of Fame]]. She has composed over 3,000 songs, including \"[[I Will Always Love You]]\" (a two-time U.S. country chart-topper, as well as an international pop hit for [[Whitney Houston]]), \"[[Jolene (song)|Jolene]]\", \"[[Coat of Many Colors (song)|Coat of Many Colors]]\", and \"[[9 to 5 (Dolly Parton song)|9 to 5]]\". She is also [[List of people who have won Academy, Emmy, Grammy, and Tony Awards#Four nominations|one of the few]] to have received at least one nomination from the Academy Awards, Grammy Awards, [[Tony Awards]], and [[Emmy Awards]]. As an actress, she has starred in films such as ''[[9 to 5 (film)|9 to 5]]'' (1980) and ''[[The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas (film)|The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas]]'' (1982), for which she earned [[Golden Globe]] nominations for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress \u2013 Motion Picture Comedy or Musical|Best Actress]], as well as ''[[Rhinestone (film)|Rhinestone]]'' (1984), ''[[Steel Magnolias]]'' (1989), ''[[Straight Talk]]'' (1992) and ''[[Joyful Noise (film)|Joyful Noise]]'' (2012).\n\n==Early life and career==\nDolly Rebecca Parton was born January 19, 1946, in a one-room cabin on the banks of the [[Little Pigeon River (Tennessee)|Little Pigeon River]] in [[Pittman Center, Tennessee|Pittman Center]], a very small community in [[Sevier County, Tennessee|Sevier County]] in the [[Great Smoky Mountains]] of [[East Tennessee]].{{sfn|Parton|1994}}<ref>{{cite book|last=Schmidt|first=Randy L.

Her father, known as \"Lee\", worked in the mountains of East Tennessee, first as a [[sharecropper]] and later tending his own small tobacco farm and acreage. He also worked construction jobs to supplement the farm's small income.

Her 11 pregnancies (the tenth being twins) in 20 years made her a mother of 12 by age 35. Often in poor health, she still managed to keep house and entertain her children with songs and tales of mountain folklore. Avie Lee's father, Jake Owens, was a [[Pentecostal]] preacher, so Parton and her siblings all attended church regularly. Parton has long credited her father for her business savvy, and her mother's family for her musical abilities.{{sfn|Parton|1994}}\nWhile Dolly Parton was still very young, her family moved to a farm on nearby Locust Ridge. Most of her cherished memories of youth happened there, and it is the place about which she wrote the song \"[[My Tennessee Mountain Home (song)|My Tennessee Mountain Home]]\" in the 1970s.

She released a string of singles, but the only one that charted, \"Happy, Happy Birthday Baby\", did not crack the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. Although she expressed a desire to record country material, Monument resisted, thinking her unique voice with its strong vibrato was not suited to the genre.\n\nAfter her composition \"Put It Off Until Tomorrow\", as recorded by Bill Phillips (with Parton, uncredited, on harmony), went to number six on the country chart in 1966, the label relented and allowed her to record country. Her first country single, \"Dumb Blonde\" (composed by [[Curly Putman]], one of the few songs during this era that she recorded but did not write), reached number 24 on the country chart in 1967, followed by \"Something Fishy\", which went to number 17. The two songs appeared on her first full-length album, ''[[Hello, I'm Dolly]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Hello I'm Dolly \u2013 Dolly's first solo album 1967|url=http://dollyparton.com/life-and-career/music/hello-im-dolly-album/|publisher=DollyParton.com|access-date=July 10, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Music career==\n===1967\u20131975: Country music success===\n[[File:Porter Wagoner and Dolly Parton 1969.jpg|thumb|upright|Porter Wagoner and Dolly Parton in 1969]]\nIn 1967, musician and country music entertainer [[Porter Wagoner]] invited Parton to join his organization, offering her a regular spot on his weekly [[broadcast syndication|syndicated]] television program ''The Porter Wagoner Show'', and in his road show. As documented in her 1994 autobiography,<ref name=allMusicGuide/> initially, much of Wagoner's audience was unhappy that [[Norma Jean (singer)|Norma Jean]], the performer whom Parton had replaced, had left the show, and was reluctant to accept Parton (sometimes chanting loudly for Norma Jean from the audience).<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.billboard.com/artist/301080/dolly-parton/biography|title=Dolly Parton-Biography|work=Billboard|access-date=May 18, 2013}}</ref> With Wagoner's assistance, however, Parton was eventually accepted. Wagoner convinced his label, [[RCA Victor]], to sign her. RCA decided to protect their investment by releasing her first single as a [[duet]] with Wagoner. That song, a remake of [[Tom Paxton]]'s \"[[The Last Thing on My Mind]]\", released in late 1967, reached the country top 10 in January 1968, launching a six-year streak of virtually uninterrupted top-10 singles for the pair.\n\nParton's first solo single for RCA Victor, \"[[Just Because I'm a Woman (1968 album)#Album information|Just Because I'm a Woman]]\", was released in the summer of 1968 and was a moderate chart hit, reaching number 17. For the remainder of the decade, none of her solo efforts \u2013 even \"[[In the Good Old Days (When Times Were Bad)]]\", which later became a standard \u2013 were as successful as her duets with Wagoner. The duo was named [[Country Music Association Awards|Vocal Group of the Year]] in 1968 by the [[Country Music Association]], but Parton's solo records were continually ignored. Wagoner had a significant financial stake in her future; as of 1969, he was her co-producer and owned nearly half of Owe-Par,<ref>{{cite web|title=Dolly and Uncle Bill Owens start Owe-Par Publishing Company|url=http://dollyparton.com/life-and-career/awards_milestones/owe-par-publishing-company/|publisher=DollyParton.com|access-date=June 14, 2015}}</ref> the publishing company Parton had founded with Bill Owens.\n\nBy 1970, both Parton and Wagoner had grown frustrated by her lack of solo chart success. Wagoner persuaded Parton to record [[Jimmie Rodgers (country singer)|Jimmie Rodgers]]' \"[[Mule Skinner Blues]]\", a [[gimmick]] that worked. The record shot to number three, followed closely, in February 1971, by her first number-one single, \"[[Joshua (song)|Joshua]]\". For the next two years, she had numerous solo hits \u2013 including her signature song \"[[Coat of Many Colors]]\" (number four, 1971) \u2013 in addition to her duets. Top-20 singles included \"The Right Combination\" and \"Burning the Midnight Oil\" (both duets with Wagoner, 1971); \"Lost Forever in Your Kiss\", (with Wagoner) \"[[Touch Your Woman]]\", (1972) \"[[My Tennessee Mountain Home]]\" and \"Travelin' Man\" (1973).<ref name=\"DollyPartonEntertainment.net\">{{cite web|url=http://www.dollypartonmusic.net|title=Dolly Parton Entertainment|access-date=October 7, 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150622025454/http://www.dollypartonmusic.net/|archive-date=June 22, 2015}}</ref>\n\nAlthough her solo singles and the Wagoner duets were successful, her biggest hit of this period was \"[[Jolene (song)|Jolene]]\".

Parton, who had always envisioned a solo career, made the decision to leave Wagoner's organization; the pair performed their last duet concert in April 1974, and she stopped appearing on his TV show in mid-1974, although they remained affiliated.

That decision has been credited with helping to make her many millions of dollars in royalties from the song over the years. Parton had three solo singles reach number one on the country chart in 1974 (\"Jolene\", \"I Will Always Love You\" and \"[[Love Is Like a Butterfly (song)|Love Is Like a Butterfly]]\"), as well as the duet with Porter Wagoner, \"[[Please Don't Stop Loving Me]]\". In a 2019 episode of the [[Sky Arts]] music series ''Brian Johnson: A Life on the Road'', Parton described finding old cassette tapes and realizing that she'd composed both \"Jolene\" and \"I Will Always Love You\" in the same songwriting session, telling Johnson \"Buddy, that was a good night.\" Parton again topped the singles chart in 1975 with \"[[The Bargain Store]]\".<ref>[http://www.dollymania.net/chartb.html On The Charts \u2013 The Singles], dollymania.net; accessed September 20, 2014.</ref>\n\n===1976\u20131986: Pop transition===\n[[File:Young-Dolly-Parton.jpg|thumb|upright|Parton in 1977]]\nFrom 1974 to 1980, she consistently charted in the country [[Top 40|Top 10]], with eight singles reaching number one.

In 1976, she began working closely with [[Sandy Gallin]], who served as her personal manager for the next 25 years. With her 1976 album ''[[All I Can Do (album)|All I Can Do]]'', which she co-produced with Porter Wagoner, Parton began taking more of an active role in production, and began specifically aiming her music in a more mainstream, pop direction. Her first entirely self-produced effort, ''[[New Harvest...First Gathering]]'' (1977), highlighted her pop sensibilities, both in terms of choice of songs \u2013 the album contained covers of the pop and R&B classics \"[[My Girl (The Temptations song)|My Girl]]\" and \"[[(Your Love Keeps Lifting Me) Higher and Higher|Higher and Higher]]\" \u2013 and production.<ref>{{cite web|title=New Harvest...First Gathering \u2013 18th Solo Album|url=http://dollyparton.com/life-and-career/music/new-harvest-first-gathering-album/|publisher=DollyParton.com|access-date=June 14, 2015}}</ref> Though the album was well received and topped the U.S. country albums chart, neither it nor its single \"[[Light of a Clear Blue Morning]]\" made much of an impression on the pop charts.\n\nAfter ''New Harvest'''s disappointing crossover performance, Parton turned to high-profile pop producer [[Gary Klein (producer)|Gary Klein]] for her next album. The result, 1977's ''[[Here You Come Again]],'' became her first million-seller, topping the country album chart and reaching number 20 on the pop chart. The [[Barry Mann]]-[[Cynthia Weil]]-penned [[Here You Come Again (song)|title track]] topped the country singles chart, and became Parton's first top-ten single on the pop chart (#3). A second single, the double A-sided \"[[Two Doors Down]]\"/\"[[It's All Wrong, But It's All Right]]\" topped the country chart and crossed over to the pop Top 20. For the remainder of the 1970s and into the early 1980s, many of her subsequent singles moved up on both charts simultaneously. Her albums during this period were developed specifically for pop-[[crossover (music)|crossover]] success.<ref>{{cite web|title=Dolly Parton's Official Song List|url=http://dollyparton.com/music-discography-song-list/|publisher=DollyParton.com|access-date=June 14, 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Dolly Parton and Burnett.jpg|thumb|upright|left|With [[Carol Burnett]], 1980]]\nIn 1978, Parton won a [[Grammy Award for Best Female Country Vocal Performance]] for her ''Here You Come Again'' album.

In 1979, Parton hosted the NBC special ''The Seventies: An Explosion of Country Music'', performed live at the [[Ford Theatre]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], and whose audience included President [[Jimmy Carter]].\nHer commercial success grew in 1980, with three consecutive country chart number-one hits: the [[Donna Summer]]-written \"[[Starting Over Again (Donna Summer song)|Starting Over Again]]\", \"[[Old Flames Can't Hold a Candle to You]]\", and \"[[9 to 5 (Dolly Parton song)|9 to 5]]\", which topped the country and pop charts in early 1981.<ref name=\"allMusicGuide\"/> She had another Top 10 single that year with \"Making Plans\", a single released from a 1980 [[Porter & Dolly|reunion album with Porter Wagoner]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Just Between Me And You compilation w/Porter Wagoner|url=http://dollyparton.com/life-and-career/music/just-between-you-and-me-compilation/|publisher=DollyParton.com|access-date=June 14, 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Dolly Parton 2.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Dolly Parton holding a baby in [[Honolulu]], [[Hawaii]], 1983]]\nThe theme song to the 1980 feature film ''[[9 to 5 (film)|9 to 5]]'', in which she starred along with [[Jane Fonda]] and [[Lily Tomlin]], \"9 to 5\", not only reached number one on the country chart, but also, in February 1981, reached number one on the pop and the [[adult contemporary music|adult-contemporary]] charts, giving her a triple number-one hit. Parton became one of the few female country singers to have a number-one single on the country and pop charts simultaneously. It also received a nomination for an [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]]. Her singles continued to appear consistently in the country Top 10. Between 1981 and 1985, she had 12 Top-10 hits; half of them hit number one. She continued to make inroads on the pop chart as well. A re-recorded version of \"I Will Always Love You,\" from the feature film ''[[The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas (film)|The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas]]'' (1982) scraped the Top 50 that year and her duet with [[Kenny Rogers]], \"[[Islands in the Stream (song)|Islands in the Stream]]\" (written by the [[Bee Gees]] and produced by [[Barry Gibb]]), spent two weeks at number one in 1983.<ref name=allMusicGuide/>\n\nIn the mid-1980s, her record sales were still relatively strong, with \"[[Save the Last Dance for Me]]\", \"[[Downtown (Petula Clark song)|Downtown]]\", \"[[Tennessee Homesick Blues]]\" (1984), \"[[Real Love (Dolly Parton and Kenny Rogers song)|Real Love]]\" (another duet with Kenny Rogers), \"[[Don't Call It Love]]\" (1985) and \"[[Think About Love]]\" (1986) all reaching the country Top 10 (\"Tennessee Homesick Blues\" and \"Think About Love\" reached number one; \"Real Love\" also reached number one on the country chart and became a modest crossover hit).

The album revitalized Parton's music career, spending five weeks at number one on ''Billboard's'' Country Albums chart, and also reached the top 10 on ''Billboard'''s Top-200 Albums chart. It sold several million copies and produced four Top 10 country hits, including [[Phil Spector]]'s \"[[To Know Him Is to Love Him]]\", which went to number one. ''Trio'' won the [[Grammy Award for Best Country Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal]] and was nominated for a [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year]]. After a further attempt at pop success with ''[[Rainbow (Dolly Parton album)|Rainbow]],'' (1987) including the single \"[[The River Unbroken]]\", Parton focused on recording country material. ''[[White Limozeen]]'' (1989) produced two number one hits in \"[[Why'd You Come in Here Lookin' Like That]]\" and \"[[Yellow Roses]]\".

Both the single and the album were massively successful. Parton's soundtrack album from the 1992 film, ''[[Straight Talk]]'', however, was less successful. But her 1993 album ''[[Slow Dancing with the Moon]]'' won critical acclaim and did well on the charts, reaching number four on the country albums chart, and number 16 on the ''Billboard'' 200 album chart. She recorded \"The Day I Fall in Love\" as a duet with [[James Ingram]] for the feature film ''[[Beethoven's 2nd (film)|Beethoven's 2nd]]'' (1993). The songwriters (Ingram, [[Carole Bayer Sager]], and [[Clif Magness]]) were nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Song, and Parton and Ingram performed the song at the awards telecast.

Strengthening and widening further, the tornado inflicted more significant damage as it crossed [[Mississippi Highway 27]]. As it passed to the east of [[Sartinville, Mississippi|Sartinville]], the tornado reached its peak intensity as it completely swept away a house at EF4 intensity near James Ratcliff Road, leaving only a bare foundation slab behind. This house was anchor-bolted to its foundation, though nearby trees did not sustain damage consistent with a tornado stronger than EF4 strength. One tree on the property was ripped out the ground and thrown several feet.

Crossing into [[Jefferson Davis County, Mississippi|Jefferson Davis County]], EF2 damage occurred in areas to the northeast of Oak Vale, where numerous trees and power poles were snapped, outbuildings were destroyed, homes sustained severe roof damage, and a mobile home was destroyed. A small area of EF3 damage occurred along Kirkley Lane, where some trees were denuded and partially debarked. A home and an outbuilding farther away from the center of the damage path sustained sustained EF1 damage as well. Additional EF2 damage occurred to the west and north of [[Carson, Mississippi|Carson]], where a small business housed in a manufactured structure was completely destroyed, many trees were downed, and two well-built homes had their roofs torn off.

Multiple mobile homes were also destroyed in this area, and power poles were snapped. Additional EF3-level tree damage occurred along Terrell Road before the tornado crossed into [[Covington County, Mississippi|Covington County]]. EF3 tree damage again occurred along Three Notch Road, while a mobile home and two frame homes were destroyed nearby. The tornado weakened back to EF2 intensity as it approached and crossed [[U.S. Route 84]], snapping and uprooting numerous trees and destroying numerous chicken houses. As the tornado continued to the northeast, it produced EF1 to EF2 damage as it approached and crossed [[U.S. Route 49]] to the northwest of [[Collins, Mississippi|Collins]], downing many trees, some of which landed on homes and mobile homes. A small silo was blown over, outbuildings were destroyed, a mobile home was blown away and destroyed, and some houses sustained roof damage. Crossing Jones Chapel Road to the northeast, the tornado weakened to EF1 strength, with damage limited to downed trees. EF1 tree and outbuilding damage continued through the northwestern corner of [[Jones County, Mississippi|Jones County]] and the southwestern corner of [[Smith County, Mississippi|Smith County]], and a church sustained some damage along this segment of the path as well. EF1 damage continued into [[Jasper County, Mississippi|Jasper County]], where a house and a chicken farm were damaged, and many trees were downed in and around the small community of [[Stringer, Mississippi|Stringer]].

It first touched down along Price Road in [[Lawrence County, Mississippi]], east-southeast of the small community of [[Topeka, Mississippi|Topeka]]. Damage at the beginning of the path consisted of a few trees uprooted at EF0 strength. The tornado continued to the northeast, reaching EF2 intensity as it crossed Given Road, where a large swath of trees was flattened. EF2 damage continued to the northeast, with many large trees snapped and uprooted. A house along Rayborn Lane sustained EF1 roof damage, and two nearby sheds were damaged as well. The tornado strengthened further and reached EF3 strength as it moved through a wooded area near the [[Pearl River]], where numerous trees were snapped and partially debarked. After crossing the Pearl River, the tornado passed northeast of [[Oak Vale, Mississippi|Oak Vale]] where some homes sustained roof and exterior wall loss, numerous trees were snapped, a metal building was destroyed, and damage was rated EF2 to EF3. Crossing into [[Jefferson Davis County, Mississippi|Jefferson Davis County]], EF2 damage occurred in areas to the northeast of Oak Vale, where numerous trees and power poles were snapped, outbuildings were destroyed, homes sustained severe roof damage, and a mobile home was destroyed. A small area of EF3 damage occurred along Kirkley Lane, where some trees were denuded and partially debarked. A home and an outbuilding farther away from the center of the damage path sustained sustained EF1 damage as well. Additional EF2 damage occurred to the west and north of [[Carson, Mississippi|Carson]], where a small business housed in a manufactured structure was completely destroyed, many trees were downed, and two well-built homes had their roofs torn off. EF2 damage continued to the northeast of Carson, where several mobile homes were destroyed, another house had its roof ripped off, and multiple other homes sustained less severe roof damage.<ref name=\"dmgview\"/>\n\nCrossing [[Mississippi Highway 35]], the tornado again attained EF3 strength as the James Hill Church was completely leveled, a nearby home sustained collapse of its exterior walls, and trees were denuded and partially debarked. Multiple mobile homes were also destroyed in this area, and power poles were snapped. Additional EF3-level tree damage occurred along Terrell Road before the tornado crossed into [[Covington County, Mississippi|Covington County]]. EF3 tree damage again occurred along Three Notch Road, while a mobile home and two frame homes were destroyed nearby. The tornado weakened back to EF2 intensity as it approached and crossed [[U.S. Route 84]], snapping and uprooting numerous trees and destroying numerous chicken houses. As the tornado continued to the northeast, it produced EF1 to EF2 damage as it approached and crossed [[U.S. Route 49]] to the northwest of [[Collins, Mississippi|Collins]], downing many trees, some of which landed on homes and mobile homes. A small silo was blown over, outbuildings were destroyed, a mobile home was blown away and destroyed, and some houses sustained roof damage. Crossing Jones Chapel Road to the northeast, the tornado weakened to EF1 strength, with damage limited to downed trees. EF1 tree and outbuilding damage continued through the northwestern corner of [[Jones County, Mississippi|Jones County]] and the southwestern corner of [[Smith County, Mississippi|Smith County]], and a church sustained some damage along this segment of the path as well. EF1 damage continued into [[Jasper County, Mississippi|Jasper County]], where a house and a chicken farm were damaged, and many trees were downed in and around the small community of [[Stringer, Mississippi|Stringer]]. EF1 tree and outbuilding damage continued along the remainder of the path and through the rural community of [[Paulding, Mississippi|Paulding]] until the tornado dissipated along County Road 31 to the south of [[Rose Hill, Mississippi]].<ref name=\"JAN_0412\" /><ref name=\"dmgview\"/>\n\nRemaining on the ground for {{convert|84.1|mi|km|abbr=on|sortable=on}}, this was the longest tracked-tornado of the outbreak.

It quickly strengthened and impacted an industrial area on the south side of [[Fort Oglethorpe, Georgia]] at EF1 strength, damaging multiple businesses along [[Georgia State Highway 2|SR 2]]. A weather station at the Public Works Department measured an unconfirmed gust of {{convert|106|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}. Thereafter, the tornado weakened back to an EF0 and produced weak, sporadic tree and structural damage to a few homes as it skipped northeast. It then crossed [[Interstate 75 in Georgia|Intersate 75]] before moving into [[Tennessee]].<ref name=\"FFC_0415\"/> The tornado then strengthened to EF1 strength again as it impacted the the Harris Hills area, uprooting trees. It then rapidly reached its peak intensity of EF3 as entered the Bella Vista Acres area, causing significant roof damage to several structures. An auto-parts store in the area was leveled and a resturant on the end of a large shopping building had its facade ripped off a restaurant and its roofed peeled back. As the tornado continued northeast, a [[tornado emergency]] was issued for [[Collegedale, Tennessee|Collegedale]] and [[Ooltewah, Tennessee|Ooltewah]]. The tornado then reached its widest part of the as it entered the Drake Forest neighborhood while still at EF3 intensity. Widespread damage to structures occurred here as homes, roofs, and trees sustained significant damage. EF2 to EF3 damage continued through the Holly Hills neighborhood where additional trees were snapped, power poles were downed, and homes sustained significant damage. The tornado then abruptly narrowed and weakened back to EF1 strength as it moved directly into [[Ooltewah, Tennessee|Ooltewah]] and hit the Integra Hills Preserve Apartments, where many homes sustained roof damage.
