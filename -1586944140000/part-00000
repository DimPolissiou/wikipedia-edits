These first regional women-only events exposed audiences to feminist and [[Coming out|openly lesbian]] artists, most of whom operated independently of the mainstream recording industry. Festival gatherings offered an alternative to urban bars, coffeehouses and protest marches, which were some of the few opportunities for lesbians to meet one another in the early 1970s.

These first regional women-only events exposed audiences to feminist and [[Coming out|openly lesbian]] artists, most of whom operated independently of the mainstream recording industry. Festival gatherings offered an alternative to urban bars, coffeehouses and protest marches, which were some of the few opportunities for lesbians to meet one another in the early 1970s. The [[feminist separatism]] of the spaces was a direct outgrowth of and solidarity with the activism created by black power and other racial solidarity movements.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Levy|first1=Ariel|title=Lesbian Nation|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2009/03/02/lesbian-nation|work=[[The New Yorker]]|date=February 22, 2009}}</ref>\n\n===1970s===\nIn 1976, Lisa Vogel, along with sister Kristie Vogel and friend Mary Kindig,<ref>{{cite book|editor1-last=Stein|editor1-first=Marc|title=Encyclopedia of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender History in America|date=2003|chapter=Music: Women's Festivals, by Bonnie J.

They were joined by local businesswoman Susan Alborell. When their application to form a non-profit collective was denied, the We Want the Music Corporation was structured as the parent company of MWMF.  Michfest was initially conceptualized as an event attended by women and feminist men; however, it became a women-only festival when the characteristics of outdoors camping was taken into consideration. MWMF was thereafter established as \"an event for lesbians\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Kendall|first=Laurie J.|title=The Michigan Womyn's Music Festival: An Amazon Matrix of Meaning|year=2013|edition=2nd|pp=22\u201326 |publisher=The Spiral Womyn's Press|location=Baltimore|isbn=978-0615200651}}</ref> Years later, author and feminist scholar [[Bonnie J.

completed (lack of wind)''. However four races were completed. The final results of this series is stated below. The first race was sailed in a storm. During the race winds were reported over 70 km/h. During the start sequens there was even more. Out of 79 boats only 43 made it to the first mark and only 29 to the finish line! The rest of the week was characterize by light air. Since 5 races need to be completed for a valid championship, the team of [[Denmark]] won the series but not the World Championship.\n{{Sailing result block | event = World Championship | classinsigna

completed (lack of wind)''. However four races were completed. The final results of this series is stated below. The first race was sailed in a storm. During the race winds were reported over 70 km/h. During the start sequens there was even more. Out of 79 boats only 43 made it to the first mark and only 29 to the finish line! The rest of the week was characterize by light air. Since 5 races need to be completed for a valid championship, the team of [[Denmark]] won the series but not the World Championship.\n{{Sailing result block | event = World Championship | classinsigna

He retired in 1975, having scored a total of 279 goals in 661 league and cup appearances across 18 seasons in [[the Football League]].\n\nHe was appointed player-manager at [[Southern Football League|Southern League Premier Division]] side [[Kettering Town F.C.|Kettering Town]] in 1975, a position he retained for two years. Whilst at the club he negotiated the first shirt sponsorship deal in English football. He chaired the [[Professional Footballers' Association]] (PFA) from 1970 to 1978, and helped to further players' rights and set up the first PFA player awards in 1974. Also throughout the 1970s he became a football pundit and writer, and became particularly well known for his part in [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]'s coverage of the [[1970 FIFA World Cup|1970]] and [[1974 FIFA World Cup]]. After fronting a consortium that took Wolverhampton Wanderers out of liquidation, he served the club as chairman from August 1982 to January 1985. He stood as an independent politician in the [[Belfast East (UK Parliament constituency)|Belfast East]] constituency in 1997, and later became involved in the [[UK Independence Party]].\n\n==Club career==\n\n===Distillery===\nAlexander Derek Dougan was born in [[Belfast]] on 20 January 1938, the son of Jackie and Josie Dougan.<ref name=\"page 24\">{{harvnb|Tossell|2012|p=24}}</ref> His father worked at [[Belfast Harbour|Belfast docks]].<ref name=\"page 24\"/> His grandfather, Sandy, had played at half-back for [[Linfield F.C.|Linfield]], and two of Sandy's brothers also played for some of the leading clubs in Belfast.<ref name=\"page 24\"/> As a child, Dougan would usually spend between four and eight hours a day playing football in the street.<ref>{{harvnb|Tossell|2012|p=26}}</ref> His family were poor, and later in life Dougan joked that \"on the street where I lived, if you paid your rent three weeks on the trot, the police used to come and see where you got the money from\".<ref>{{harvnb|Tossell|2012|p=28}}</ref> As a teenager he spent 18 months working at a toy factory whilst playing amateur football for Cregagh Boys.<ref name=\"page

F.C.|Distillery]] in 1953.<ref name=\"page 33\">{{harvnb|Tossell|2012|p=33}}</ref> Manager [[Jimmy McIntosh]] handed him his first team debut on 5 February 1955, in a 0\u20130 [[Irish Cup]] first  round draw with [[Glentoran F.C.|Glentoran]].<ref name=\"page 34\">{{harvnb|Tossell|2012|p=34}}</ref> [[Maurice Tadman]], who succeeded McIntosh as the club's manager in the summer of 1955, preferred to use Dougan as a target man centre-forward, as Dougan's height made him adept at winning and flicking on headers in the opposition penalty area.<ref name=\"page 35\">{{harvnb|Tossell|2012|p=35}}</ref>\n\nWhilst playing part-time for Distillery he also worked at the [[Harland and Wolff]] shipbuilding company.<ref name=\"page 36\">{{harvnb|Tossell|2012|p=36}}</ref> Though the [[maximum wage]] in England discouraged many of Belfast's top players from leaving their hometown, Dougan was determined to leave for the [[English Football League]] at the earliest opportunity, particularly so following the death of his mother in June 1955.<ref name=\"page 37\">{{harvnb|Tossell|2012|p=37}}</ref> He began to attract scouts from England after helping Distillery beat [[Glentoran F.C.|Glentoran]] 1\u20130 in the second replay of the [[1955\u201356 Irish Cup|1956 final]] of the Irish Cup at [[Windsor Park]].<ref name=\"page 38\">{{harvnb|Tossell|2012|p=38}}</ref> He played mostly at half-back in the [[1956\u201357 Irish League|1956\u201357]] season as Distillery finished sixth in the [[Northern Ireland Football

F.C.|Portsmouth]] for a fee of \u00a34,000 in August 1957.<ref name = \"death\"/> \"Pompey\" struggled to a 20th-place finish in the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] in the [[1957\u201358 Portsmouth F.C. season|1957\u201358]] season, and some of his teammates resented Dougan for what he himself felt was the constructive criticism he offered in the dressing room.<ref name=\"page 50\">{{harvnb|Tossell|2012|p=50}}</ref> He made his first team debut, providing an assist for [[Jackie Henderson]] in a 3\u20130 victory over [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] at [[Old Trafford]].<ref name=\"page 52\">{{harvnb|Tossell|2012|p=52}}</ref> He scored his first senior goal for the club in a 1\u20131 draw with [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton

53\">{{harvnb|Tossell|2012|p=53}}</ref> New manager [[Freddie Cox]], who succeeded [[Eddie Lever]] at [[Fratton Park]] in 1958, took the club to relegation with a last place finish in [[1958\u201359 Portsmouth F.C. season|1958\u201359]] season, though Dougan would miss much of the season with an ankle injury.<ref name=\"page 60\">{{harvnb|Tossell|2012|p=60}}</ref>\n\n===Blackburn Rovers===\nDougan was sold on to [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] for a fee of \u00a315,000 in March 1959.<ref name = \"death\"/> He scored on his Rovers debut in a 1\u20131 draw away to [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] at [[Arsenal Stadium|Highbury]].<ref name=\"page 64\">{{harvnb|Tossell|2012|p=64}}</ref> He scored twice on the opening day of the [[1959\u201360 Football League|1959\u201360]] season, a 4\u20130 victory over [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]], which began a sequence of five wins and a draw from Rovers's first six matches, at the end of which the club were in second-place and Dougan tallied eleven goals, four of which came in a 6\u20132 victory over [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]].<ref name=\"page 66\">{{harvnb|Tossell|2012|p=66}}</ref> Though their league campaign petered out to an eventual 17th-place finish, Rovers reached the [[1960 FA Cup Final]] at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]] after Dougan scored the winning goal past [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] in the semi-finals.<ref name=\"page 69\">{{harvnb|Tossell|2012|p=69}}</ref> However, he did not enjoy his time at [[Ewood Park]], and later wrote that \"the dourness of the club matched that of the town. I could not shake off the depression that caused me to wake each day regretting that I had to go to the ground. Life was grey and monotonous\".<ref name=\"page 67\">{{harvnb|Tossell|2012|p=67}}</ref> This led to him handing in a transfer request the day before the final, which he later admitted was an occasion where his \"vanity triumphed over common sense\".<ref name=\"page 70\">{{harvnb|Tossell|2012|p=70}}</ref> He was not at full fitness in the final itself, and had a quiet game as Blackburn lost 3\u20130 to Wolverhampton Wanderers.<ref name=\"page 73\">{{harvnb|Tossell|2012|p=73}}</ref> He opened the [[1960\u201361 Football League|1960\u201361]] season with a hat-trick in a 3\u20130 win over Manchester United and went on to withdraw his transfer request.<ref name=\"page 75\">{{harvnb|Tossell|2012|p=75}}</ref>\n\n===Aston Villa===\nDougan was signed by [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] in July 1961 for a fee of \u00a315,000.<ref name = \"death\"/> He was signed by manager [[Joe Mercer]] as a replacement for [[Gerry Hitchens]], who had been sold on to [[Inter Milan]] earlier in the summer for \u00a385,000.<ref name=\"page 92\">{{harvnb|Tossell|2012|p=92}}</ref> Teammate [[Peter McParland]] later commented that \"when Derek came to us at Aston Villa I think it was at a time when he was not taking the game particularly seriously\".<ref name=\"page 93\">{{harvnb|Tossell|2012|p=93}}</ref> After returning from watching his \"Villans\" teammates win the [[1961 Football League Cup Final|1961 League Cup Final]] at [[Villa Park]] on 5 September, Dougan was a passenger in a car accident which killed fellow passenger Malcolm Williams and left Dougan with a broken arm and head injuries; driver and teammate [[Bobby Thomson (footballer, born 1937)|Bobby Thomson]] was charged but found 'Not Guilty' of careless driving.<ref name=\"page 94\">{{harvnb|Tossell|2012|p=94}}</ref> In

summer of 1963.<ref name=\"page 100\">{{harvnb|Tossell|2012|p=100}}</ref> He later admitted that \"I had made a mistake in going to the Third Division when I was a First Division player\".<ref name=\"page 103\">{{harvnb|Tossell|2012|p=103}}</ref> The move did though have its benefits, as the club's physiotherapist managed to diagnose and eventually correct an ankle injury that had troubled Dougan for the previous five years.<ref name=\"page 103\"/> He scored 20 goals in 38 league games in the [[1963\u201364 Peterborough United F.C. season|1963\u201364]] season, and at the end of the campaign manager [[Jack Fairbrother]] was replaced by [[Gordon Clark (footballer)|Gordon Clark]], who Dougan said \"renewed my sense of vocation\".<ref name=\"page 105\">{{harvnb|Tossell|2012|p=105}}</ref> He then scored seven goals in the club's [[1964\u201365 Peterborough United F.C. season|1964\u201365]] run to the sixth round of the FA Cup, including one in their 2\u20131 win over top-flight Arsenal at [[London Road Stadium|London Road]].<ref name=\"page 108\">{{harvnb|Tossell|2012|p=108}}</ref> Peterborough's league promotion campaign failed despite their cup exploits, causing Dougan to remark that \"after playing at [[Stamford Bridge (stadium)|Stamford Bridge]] it was not easy to go to places like [[Gillingham F.C.|Gillingham]] on a cold Tuesday evening, where they are waiting for you with their sleeves rolled up\".<ref name=\"page 111\">{{harvnb|Tossell|2012|p=111}}</ref>\n\n===Leicester City===\nDougan returned to the First Division when he signed for [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] in May 1965 for a \u00a326,000 fee.<ref name=\"page 111\"/> However, he had a difficult relationship with manager [[Matt Gillies]] despite being the first choice striker at [[Filbert Street]].<ref name=\"page 116\">{{harvnb|Tossell|2012|p=116}}</ref> He scored 19 goals in 37 league games in the [[1965\u201366 Leicester City F.C.

120\">{{harvnb|Tossell|2012|p=120}}</ref>\n\n===Wolverhampton Wanderers===\nIn March 1967, Dougan dropped into the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] after being signed by Wolverhampton Wanderers manager [[Ronnie Allen]] for a \u00a350,000 fee.<ref name = \"death\"/> He marked his home debut on 25 March by scoring a hat-trick against [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]].<ref

to secure promotion to the First Division.<ref name=\"page 124\">{{harvnb|Tossell|2012|p=124}}</ref> He spent the summer of 1967 in the United States playing for the [[Los Angeles Wolves]] in the

6\u20135 in the [[USA Final 1967|USA Final]] at the [[Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum]].<ref name=\"page 126\">{{harvnb|Tossell|2012|p=126}}</ref>\n\nStrike partner [[Ernie Hunt]] was sold to [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] for \u00a380,000 in September 1967, which reduced the effectiveness of the Wolves attack, though Dougan still managed to finish as the club's top-scorer with 17 goals in 40 appearances across the [[1967\u201368 Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C. season|1967\u201368]] campaign as Wolves retained their top-flight status with a 17th-place finish.<ref name=\"page 126\"/> In November 1968, [[Bill McGarry]] replaced Allen as manager, and Dougan later described the seven years he spent playing for McGarry as \"the most traumatic of my career\".<ref name=\"page

games as Wolves posted a 16th-place finish.<ref name=\"page 135\">{{harvnb|Tossell|2012|p=135}}</ref> He spent the summer of [[1969 North American Soccer League season|1969]] in the United States as

where they won the NASL International Cup.<ref name=\"page 135\"/>\n\nWolves enjoyed an excellent start to the [[1969\u201370 Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C. season|1969\u201370]] season, winning seven of their opening eight games, but fell away to a mid-table finish after the shock retirement of 24-year old forward [[Peter Knowles]], who left the game to become a full-time [[Jehovah's Witnesses|Jehovah's Witness]] volunteer.<ref name=\"page 138\">{{harvnb|Tossell|2012|p=138}}</ref> Dougan had a poor season, limited to just ten goals in 33 games due to injuries and an eight-week suspension for verbally abusing a linesman in a home defeat to Everton.<ref name=\"page 139\">{{harvnb|Tossell|2012|p=139}}</ref> In the return fixture at [[Goodison Park]], he suffered a clash of

140\">{{harvnb|Tossell|2012|p=140}}</ref> McGarry did not speak to Dougan during his two-month absence, but Dougan decided against issuing a transfer request as he did not want to further his reputation as a journeyman player.<ref name=\"page 140\"/>\n\nWolves finished fourth in the [[1970\u201371 Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C. season|1970\u201371]] season, with Dougan claiming 12 goals from 25 league games as he was rotated throughout the campaign with [[Hugh Curran]] and [[Bobby Gould]].<ref name=\"page 160\">{{harvnb|Tossell|2012|p=160}}</ref> Wolves also won the inaugural [[Texaco

country during the early 1970s.<ref name=\"page 162\">{{harvnb|Tossell|2012|p=162}}</ref> They qualified for the [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]], and Dougan scored a hat-trick in a first round

June 2007) was a [[Northern Ireland national football team|Northern Ireland]] international [[Association football|footballer]], football manager, football chairman, pundit, and writer. He was also known by his nickname, \"'''The Doog'''\".<ref>{{cite news|last1=Scott|first1=Ged|title=Football: Colourful life and times of Wolves hero Dougan; DEREK DOUGAN APPRECIATION. \u2013 Free Online Library|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Football%3A+Colourful+life+and+times+of+Wolves+hero+Dougan%3B+DEREK...-a0165544836|accessdate=27 July 2016|work=The Birmingham Post|date=25 June 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=OBITUARY: Derek Dougan. \u2013 Free Online Library|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/OBITUARY%3A+Derek+Dougan.-a0165658107|accessdate=27 July 2016|work=Daily Post|date=26 June 2007}}</ref> He was capped by Northern Ireland at [[Northern Ireland national under-16 football team|schoolboy]], [[Northern Ireland national under-17 football team|youth]], Amateur, and [[Northern Ireland B national football team|'B' team]] level, before he won 43 caps in a 15-year career for the senior team from 1958 to 1973, scoring eight international goals and featuring in the [[1958 FIFA World Cup]]. He also played in the [[Shamrock Rovers XI v Brazil]] exhibition match in July 1973, which he also helped to organise.\n\nA strong and physical [[Forward (association football)|forward]], he began his career at [[Lisburn Distillery F.C.|Distillery]] in his native [[Belfast]]. He helped Distillery to win the [[Irish Cup]] in 1956, before he won a \u00a34,000 move to English [[Football League First Division|First Division]] side [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] in August 1957. He was sold on to [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]]  in March 1959 for a fee of \u00a315,000, and played for the club in the [[1960 FA Cup Final]] despite handing in a transfer request the day before the final. He moved on to [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] for \u00a315,000 in July 1961, but struggled with injuries during a two-season stay at [[Villa Park]]. He dropped into the [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]] to join [[Peterborough United F.C.|Peterborough United]] in 1963, who paid a \u00a321,000 transfer fee. He returned to the top flight in November 1965 after being sold to [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] for \u00a326,000. He was sold to [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] for a \u00a350,000 fee in March 1967, and helped the club to win promotion out of the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] in 1966\u201367, to lift the [[Texaco Cup]] in 1970 and the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] in [[1974 Football League Cup Final|1974]], and also played on the losing side of the [[1972 UEFA Cup Final|1972]] [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]] final. He also spent two summers in the United States playing for the club's sister teams, the [[Los Angeles Wolves]] and the [[Kansas City Spurs]], who he helped to win the [[United Soccer Association]] and [[North American Soccer League (1968\u201384)|NASL International Cup]] respectively. He retired in 1975, having scored a total of 279 goals in 661 league and cup appearances across 18 seasons in [[the Football League]].\n\nHe was appointed player-manager at [[Southern Football League|Southern League Premier Division]] side [[Kettering Town F.C.|Kettering Town]] in 1975, a position he retained for two years. Whilst at the club he negotiated the first shirt sponsorship deal in English football. He chaired the [[Professional Footballers' Association]] (PFA) from 1970 to 1978, and helped to further players' rights and set up the first PFA player awards in 1974. Also throughout the 1970s he became a football pundit and writer, and became particularly well known for his part in [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]'s coverage of the [[1970 FIFA World Cup|1970]] and [[1974 FIFA World Cup]]. After fronting a consortium that took Wolverhampton Wanderers out of liquidation, he served the club as chairman from August 1982 to January 1985. He stood as an independent politician in the [[Belfast East (UK Parliament constituency)|Belfast East]] constituency in 1997, and later became involved in the [[UK Independence Party]].\n\n==Club career==\n\n===Distillery===\nAlexander Derek Dougan was born in [[Belfast]] on 20 January 1938, the son of Jackie and Josie Dougan.<ref name=\"page 24\">{{harvnb|Tossell|2012|p=24}}</ref> His father worked at [[Belfast Harbour|Belfast docks]].<ref name=\"page 24\"/> His grandfather, Sandy, had played at half-back for [[Linfield F.C.|Linfield]], and two of Sandy's brothers also played for some of the leading clubs in Belfast.<ref name=\"page 24\"/> As a child, Dougan would usually spend between four and eight hours a day playing football in the street.<ref>{{harvnb|Tossell|2012|p=26}}</ref> His family were poor, and later in life Dougan joked that \"on the street where I lived, if you paid your rent three weeks on the trot, the police used to come and see where you got the money from\".<ref>{{harvnb|Tossell|2012|p=28}}</ref> As a teenager he spent 18 months working at a toy factory whilst playing amateur football for Cregagh Boys.<ref name=\"page 29\">{{harvnb|Tossell|2012|p=29}}</ref> He also trained with Linfield, but could not break into any of their junior teams.<ref name=\"page 29\"/> He instead joined [[Lisburn Distillery F.C.|Distillery]] in 1953.<ref name=\"page 33\">{{harvnb|Tossell|2012|p=33}}</ref> Manager [[Jimmy McIntosh]] handed him his first team debut on 5 February 1955, in a 0\u20130 [[Irish Cup]] first  round draw with [[Glentoran F.C.|Glentoran]].<ref name=\"page 34\">{{harvnb|Tossell|2012|p=34}}</ref> [[Maurice Tadman]], who succeeded McIntosh as the club's manager in the summer of 1955, preferred to use Dougan as a target man centre-forward, as Dougan's height made him adept at winning and flicking on headers in the opposition penalty area.<ref name=\"page 35\">{{harvnb|Tossell|2012|p=35}}</ref>\n\nWhilst playing part-time for Distillery he also worked at the [[Harland and Wolff]] shipbuilding company.<ref name=\"page 36\">{{harvnb|Tossell|2012|p=36}}</ref> Though the [[maximum wage]] in England discouraged many of Belfast's top players from leaving their hometown, Dougan was determined to leave for the [[English Football League]] at the earliest opportunity, particularly so following the death of his mother in June 1955.<ref name=\"page 37\">{{harvnb|Tossell|2012|p=37}}</ref> He began to attract scouts from England after helping Distillery beat [[Glentoran F.C.|Glentoran]] 1\u20130 in the second replay of the [[1955\u201356 Irish Cup|1956 final]] of the Irish Cup at [[Windsor Park]].<ref name=\"page 38\">{{harvnb|Tossell|2012|p=38}}</ref> He played mostly at half-back in the [[1956\u201357 Irish League|1956\u201357]] season as Distillery finished sixth in the [[Northern Ireland Football League|Irish League]] and ended up as runners-up in the [[Ulster Cup]], [[City Cup (Northern Ireland)|City Cup]], and [[County Antrim Shield]].<ref name=\"page 41\">{{harvnb|Tossell|2012|p=41}}</ref>\n\n===Portsmouth===\nDougan had trials at [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]] and [[Bury F.C.|Bury]], before he was signed by [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] for a fee of \u00a34,000 in August 1957.<ref name = \"death\"/> \"Pompey\" struggled to a 20th-place finish in the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] in the [[1957\u201358 Portsmouth F.C. season|1957\u201358]] season, and some of his teammates resented Dougan for what he himself felt was the constructive criticism he offered in the dressing room.<ref name=\"page 50\">{{harvnb|Tossell|2012|p=50}}</ref> He made his first team debut, providing an assist for [[Jackie Henderson]] in a 3\u20130 victory over [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] at [[Old Trafford]].<ref name=\"page 52\">{{harvnb|Tossell|2012|p=52}}</ref> He scored his first senior goal for the club in a 1\u20131 draw with [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]], though was criticised by ''[[Daily Mail]]'' journalist Jack Wood for celebrating the goal with an \"arms akimbo display of histrionics\".<ref name=\"page 53\">{{harvnb|Tossell|2012|p=53}}</ref> New manager [[Freddie Cox]], who succeeded [[Eddie Lever]] at [[Fratton Park]] in 1958, took the club to relegation with a last place finish in [[1958\u201359 Portsmouth F.C. season|1958\u201359]] season, though Dougan would miss much of the season with an ankle injury.<ref name=\"page 60\">{{harvnb|Tossell|2012|p=60}}</ref>\n\n===Blackburn Rovers===\nDougan was sold on to [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] for a fee of \u00a315,000 in March 1959.<ref name = \"death\"/> He scored on his Rovers debut in a 1\u20131 draw away to [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] at [[Arsenal Stadium|Highbury]].<ref name=\"page 64\">{{harvnb|Tossell|2012|p=64}}</ref> He scored twice on the opening day of the [[1959\u201360 Football League|1959\u201360]] season, a 4\u20130 victory over [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]], which began a sequence of five wins and a draw from Rovers's first six matches, at the end of which the club were in second-place and Dougan tallied eleven goals, four of which came in a 6\u20132 victory over [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]].<ref name=\"page 66\">{{harvnb|Tossell|2012|p=66}}</ref> Though their league campaign petered out to an eventual 17th-place finish, Rovers reached the [[1960 FA Cup Final]] at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]] after Dougan scored the winning goal past [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] in the semi-finals.<ref name=\"page 69\">{{harvnb|Tossell|2012|p=69}}</ref> However, he did not enjoy his time at [[Ewood Park]], and later wrote that \"the dourness of the club matched that of the town. I could not shake off the depression that caused me to wake each day regretting that I had to go to the ground. Life was grey and monotonous\".<ref name=\"page 67\">{{harvnb|Tossell|2012|p=67}}</ref> This led to him handing in a transfer request the day before the final, which he later admitted was an occasion where his \"vanity triumphed over common sense\".<ref name=\"page 70\">{{harvnb|Tossell|2012|p=70}}</ref> He was not at full fitness in the final itself, and had a quiet game as Blackburn lost 3\u20130 to Wolverhampton Wanderers.<ref name=\"page 73\">{{harvnb|Tossell|2012|p=73}}</ref> He opened the [[1960\u201361 Football League|1960\u201361]] season with a hat-trick in a 3\u20130 win over Manchester United and went on to withdraw his transfer request.<ref name=\"page 75\">{{harvnb|Tossell|2012|p=75}}</ref>\n\n===Aston Villa===\nDougan was signed by [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] in July 1961 for a fee of \u00a315,000.<ref name = \"death\"/> He was signed by manager [[Joe Mercer]] as a replacement for [[Gerry Hitchens]], who had been sold on to [[Inter Milan]] earlier in the summer for \u00a385,000.<ref name=\"page 92\">{{harvnb|Tossell|2012|p=92}}</ref> Teammate [[Peter McParland]] later commented that \"when Derek came to us at Aston Villa I think it was at a time when he was not taking the game particularly seriously\".<ref name=\"page 93\">{{harvnb|Tossell|2012|p=93}}</ref> After returning from watching his \"Villans\" teammates win the [[1961 Football League Cup Final|1961 League Cup Final]] at [[Villa Park]] on 5 September, Dougan was a passenger in a car accident which killed fellow passenger Malcolm Williams and left Dougan with a broken arm and head injuries; driver and teammate [[Bobby Thomson (footballer, born 1937)|Bobby Thomson]] was charged but found 'Not Guilty' of careless driving.<ref name=\"page 94\">{{harvnb|Tossell|2012|p=94}}</ref> In November 2010 \u2013 three years after Dougan's death, Thomson claimed that Dougan had drunkenly pulled a [[deerstalker]] hat over his eyes, causing him to crash the car.<ref>{{cite

after three months on the sidelines and ended the [[1961\u201362 Aston Villa F.C. season|1961\u201362]] season with 12 goals in 27 matches.<ref name=\"page 96\">{{harvnb|Tossell|2012|p=96}}</ref> He twisted his knee midway through the [[1962\u201363 Aston Villa F.C. season|1962\u201363]] campaign after slipping in the street, and ended the season with 14 goals from 33 games.<ref name=\"page 96\"/>\n\n===Peterborough United===\nDougan dropped down to the [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]] to join [[Peterborough United F.C.|Peterborough United]] for a \u00a321,000 fee in the summer of 1963.<ref name=\"page 100\">{{harvnb|Tossell|2012|p=100}}</ref> He later admitted that \"I had made a mistake in going to the Third Division when I was a First Division player\".<ref name=\"page 103\">{{harvnb|Tossell|2012|p=103}}</ref> The move did though have its benefits, as the club's physiotherapist managed to diagnose and eventually correct an ankle injury that had troubled Dougan for the previous five years.<ref name=\"page 103\"/> He scored 20 goals in 38 league games in the [[1963\u201364 Peterborough United F.C. season|1963\u201364]] season, and at the end of the campaign manager [[Jack Fairbrother]] was replaced by [[Gordon Clark (footballer)|Gordon Clark]], who Dougan said \"renewed my sense of vocation\".<ref name=\"page 105\">{{harvnb|Tossell|2012|p=105}}</ref> He then scored seven goals in the club's [[1964\u201365 Peterborough United F.C. season|1964\u201365]] run to the sixth round of the FA Cup, including one in their 2\u20131 win over top-flight Arsenal at [[London Road Stadium|London Road]].<ref name=\"page 108\">{{harvnb|Tossell|2012|p=108}}</ref> Peterborough's league promotion campaign failed despite their cup exploits, causing Dougan to remark that \"after playing at [[Stamford Bridge (stadium)|Stamford Bridge]] it was not easy to go to places like [[Gillingham F.C.|Gillingham]] on a cold Tuesday evening, where they are waiting for you with their sleeves rolled up\".<ref name=\"page 111\">{{harvnb|Tossell|2012|p=111}}</ref>\n\n===Leicester City===\nDougan returned to the First Division when he signed for [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] in May 1965 for a \u00a326,000 fee.<ref name=\"page 111\"/> However, he had a difficult relationship with manager [[Matt Gillies]] despite being the first choice striker at [[Filbert Street]].<ref name=\"page 116\">{{harvnb|Tossell|2012|p=116}}</ref> He scored 19 goals in 37 league games in the [[1965\u201366 Leicester City F.C.

He reports that there is an excess of males at birth in almost all human populations, and the natural sex ratio at birth is usually between 102 and 108. However the ratio may deviate significantly from this range for natural reasons such as early marriage and fertility, teenage mothers, average maternal age at birth, paternal age, age gap between father and mother, late births, ethnicity, social and economic stress, warfare, environmental and hormonal effects.<ref name=James-JournalofEndocrinology /><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Graffelman | first1 = Jan | last2 = Hoekstra | first2 = Rolf F. | year = 2000 | title = A Statistical Analysis of the Effect of Warfare on the Human Secondary Sex Ratio | url = | journal = Human Biology | volume = 72 | issue = 3| pages = 433\u2013445 | pmid = 10885189 }}</ref> This school of scholars support their alternate hypothesis with historical data when modern sex-selection technologies were unavailable, as well as birth sex ratio in sub-regions, and various ethnic groups of developed economies.<ref name=rjhmam>{{cite journal | last1 = Jacobsen | first1 = R. | last2 = M\u00f8ller | first2 = H. | last3 = Mouritsen | first3 = A. | year = 1999 | title = Natural variation in the human sex ratio | url = | journal = Hum.

In 1986, the Ministry of Health posted the Notice on Forbidding Prenatal Sex Determination, but it was not widely followed.<ref>Ministry of Health and State Family Planning Commission.1986. \"Notice on strictly forbidding prenatal sex determination,\" reprinted in Peng Peiyun(ed.), 1997, Family Planning Encyclopedia of China.

This is partially due to the belief that, while sons are always part of the family, daughters are only temporary, going to a new family when they marry. Additionally, if a woman's firstborn child is a son, her position in society moves up, while the same is not true of a firstborn daughter.<ref name= Junhong />\n\nIn the past, desire for a son was manifested by large birth rates\u2014many couples would continue to have children until they had a son.<ref name=Junhong /> However, the combination of financial concerns and, more importantly, the One-child policy (discussed further below) have led to an increase in gender planning and selection. Even in rural areas, most women know that ultrasonography can be used for gender discernment. For each subsequent birth, Junhong found that women are over 10% more likely to have an ultrasound (39% for firstborn, 55% for second born, 67% for third born). Additionally, he found that the sex of the firstborn child impacts whether a woman will have an ultrasound in her subsequent pregnancies: 40% of women with a firstborn son have an ultrasound for their second born child, versus 70% of women with firstborn daughters. This points to a strong desire to select for a son if one has not been born yet.<ref name=Junhong />\n\n[[File:Sex ratio at birth in mainland China.png|thumb|450px|Birth sex ratios have dramatically changed in China since the implementation of the [[One-Child Policy]].]]\nBecause of the lack of data about childbirth, a number of researchers have worked to learn about abortion statistics in China.

As MacPherson (2007) notes, there can be significant differences in gender violence and access to food, healthcare, immunizations between male and female children. This leads to high infant and childhood mortality among girls, which causes changes in sex ratio.<ref name=macpherson />\n\nDisparate, gendered access to resources appears to be strongly linked to socioeconomic status. Specifically, poorer families are sometimes forced to ration food, with daughters typically receiving less priority than sons.<ref name= KlausenWink /> However, Klasen's 2001 study revealed that this practice is less common in the poorest families, but rises dramatically in the slightly less poor families.<ref name= KlausenWink /> Klasen and Wink's 2003 study suggests that this is \"related to greater female economic independence and fewer cultural strictures among the poorest sections of the population\". In other words, the poorest families are typically less bound by cultural expectations and norms, and women tend to have more freedom to become family breadwinners out of necessity.<ref name= KlausenWink />\n\nIncreased sex ratios can be caused by disparities in aspects of life other than vital resources. According to Sen (1990), differences in wages and job advancement also have a dramatic effect on sex ratios. This is why high sex ratios are sometimes seen in nations with little sex-selective abortion.<ref name= Sen1990 /> Additionally, high female education rates are correlated with lower sex ratios (World Bank 2011).<ref>World Bank, Engendering Development, The World Bank, (2001)</ref>\n\nLopez and Ruzikah (1983) found that, when given the same resources, women tend to outlive men at all stages of life after infancy. However, globally, resources are not always allocated equitably. Thus, some scholars argue that disparities in access to resources such as healthcare, education, and nutrition play at least a small role in the high sex ratios seen in some parts of the world.<ref name= KlausenWink /> For example, Alderman and Gerter (1997) found that unequal access to healthcare is a primary cause of female death in developing nations, especially in Southeast Asia. Moreover, in India, lack of equal access to healthcare has led to increased disease and higher rates of female mortality in every age group until the late thirties (Sen 1990). This is particularly noteworthy because, in regions of the world where women receive equal resources, women tend to outlive men (Sen 1990). Women outlive men in all but 2 countries.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.cmet.2016.05.019 |pmid=27304504 |pmc=4932837 |title=Sex Differences in Lifespan |journal=Cell Metabolism |volume=23 |issue=6 |pages=1022\u20131033 |year=2016 |last1=Austad |first1=Steven N. |last2=Fischer |first2=Kathleen E. }}</ref>\n\nEconomic disadvantage alone may not always lead to increased sex ratio, claimed Sen in 1990. For example, in sub-Saharan Africa, one of the most economically disadvantaged regions of the world, there is an excess of women. So, if economic disadvantage is uncorrelated with sex ratio in Africa, some other factor(s) may be at play.<ref name= Sen1990 /> More detailed analysis of African demographics, in 2002, suggests that Africa too has wide variation in birth sex ratios (from 1.01 in Bantu populations of East Africa to 1.08 in Nigeria and Ethiopia).<ref name=pmid12617497/> Thus economic disadvantage remains a possible unresolved hypothesis for Africa as well.\n\n== Reasons for sex-selective abortion ==\nVarious theories have been proposed as possible reasons for sex-selective abortion. Culture rather than economic conditions is favored by some researchers because such deviations in sex ratios do not exist in [[sub-Saharan Africa]], [[Latin America]], and the [[Caribbean]].<ref name=\"Gettis\" /> Other hypotheses include disparate gender-biased access to resources,<ref name=macpherson /> and attempts to control population growth such as using one child policy.<ref name=Hesketh />\n\nSome demographers question whether sex-selective abortion or infanticide claims are accurate, because underreporting of female births may also explain high sex ratios.<ref>{{cite journal | doi=10.2307/1972351 | title=The missing girls of China: a new demographic account | last=Johansson | first=Sten | last2=Nygren | jstor=1972351 | first2=Olga | year=1991 | volume=17 | issue=1 | journal = Population and Development Review | pages=35\u201351}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | title=Are births underreported in rural China? | first=M.

Generally, before the [[information era]], male babies were preferred because they provided manual labor and continuation of the family [[Lineage (anthropology)|lineage]]. Labor is still important in developing nations as China and India, but when it comes to family lineage, it is of great importance.\n\nThe selective abortion of female fetuses is most common in areas where cultural norms value male children over female children for a variety of social and economic reasons.<ref name=\"Goodkind\" /> A son is often preferred as an \"asset\" since he can earn and support the family; a daughter is a \"liability\" since she will be married off to another family, and so will not contribute financially to her parents.

During the 19th century, in the Northwest [[British raj|British India]], one-fourth of the population preserved only half the daughters, while other 3/4th of the population had balanced sex ratio. There were 118 males per 100 females. This is comparable to the contemporary sex ratio in the area, now divided between India and Pakistan.<ref>{{cite book|title = Child Survival: Anthropological Perspectives on the Treatment and Maltreatment of Children|last = Hughes|first = Nancy Scheper|publisher = Springer|isbn = 9781556080289|year = 1987|page = 99}}</ref>\n\n[[Chinese culture]] is deeply patriarchal. Pre-modern Chinese society was predominantly patriarchal and patrilineal from at least the 11th century BC onwards.{{sfnp|Wu|2009|p=86}} There has long been a son preference in China, leading to high rates of female infanticide, as well as a strong tradition of restricting the [[freedom of movement]] of women, particularly upper-class women, manifested through the practice of [[foot binding]]. Although the legal and social standing of women have greatly improved in the 20th century, son preference remains still strong, and the situation was aggravated by the [[one child policy]].\n\nInterpretations of [[Confucianism]] have been argued to contribute to the low status of women. The gender roles prescribed in the [[Three Obediences and Four Virtues]] became a cornerstone of the family, and thus, societal stability. Starting from the Han period, Confucians began to teach that a virtuous woman was supposed to follow the males in her family: the father before her marriage, the husband after she marries, and her sons in widowhood. In the later dynasties, more emphasis was placed on the virtue of chastity. The Song dynasty Confucian [[Cheng Yi (philosopher)|Cheng Yi]] stated that: \"To starve to death is a small matter, but to lose one's chastity is a great matter.\"<ref name=\"ebrey\">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GDPskRXfl5cC&pg=PA10&lpg=PA10#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Women and the Family in Chinese History|author= Patricia Buckley Ebrey |pages=10\u201312|publisher=Routledge |date=19 September 2002 |isbn= 978-0415288224}}</ref> The \"cult of chastity\" accordingly, condemned many widows to poverty and loneliness by placing a social stigma on remarriage.<ref name=Adler>{{cite web | last = Adler | first = Joseph A. | title = Daughter/Wife/Mother or Sage/Immortal/Bodhisattva?

Dowry is an ancient practice, that has been common in many cultures around the world, and which is today prevalent especially in South Asia. The custom of dowry is most common in cultures that are strongly [[patrilineal]] and that expect women to reside with or near their husband's family ([[patrilocality]]).<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/dowry | title=Dowry &#124; marriage custom}}</ref>\n\nKirti Singh states that dowry is widely considered to be both a cause and a consequence of son preference, and this may lead to girls being unwanted, sex selective abortion, [[female infanticide]] or abuse of female children.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20140313094849/http://india.unfpa.org/drive/LawsandSonPreferenceinIndia.pdf</ref>\n\nThe [[dowry system in India]] is a major part of [[Indian culture]] and refers to the durable goods, cash, and real or movable property that the bride's family gives to the bridegroom, his parents, or his relatives as a condition of the marriage.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title = Dowry Deaths and Access to Justice in Kali's Yug: Empowerment, Law and Dowry Deaths|last = Rani Jethmalani & P.K.

In the early years of the Republic, leaders believed that telling citizens to reduce their fertility was enough, repealing laws banning [[contraception]] and instead promoting its use. However, the contraceptives were not widely available, both because of lack of supply and because of cultural taboo against discussing sex. Efforts were slowed following the famine of 1959\u201361 but were resumed shortly thereafter with virtually the same results. Then, in 1964, the Family Planning Office was established to enforce stricter guidelines regarding fertility and it was moderately successful.<ref>Henneberger, S. \"China's One-Child Policy.\" : History. N.p., 2007. Web. 24 Nov. 2013.</ref>\n\nIn 1979, the government adopted the [[One-Child Policy]], which limited many families to one child, unless specified by provincial regulations. It was instituted as an attempt to boost the Chinese economy. Under it, families who break rules regarding the number of children they are allowed are given various punishments (primarily monetary), dependent upon the province in which they live.<ref>\"History of the One-Child Policy.\" All Girls Allowed, 2013. Web. 25 Nov. 2013.</ref>\n\nAs stated above, the sex ratios of a province are largely determined by the type of restriction placed upon the family, pointing to the conclusion that much of the imbalance in sex ratio in China can be attributed to the policy. Research by Junhong (2001) found that many parents are willing to pay to ensure that their child is male (especially if their first child is female), but will not do the same to ensure their child is female.<ref name=Junhong /> Likely, fear of the harsh monetary punishments of the One-Child Policy make ensuring a son's birth a smart investment. Therefore, son's cultural and economic importance to families and the large expenses associated with multiple children are primary factors leading to China's disparate sex ratio.\n\nIn 2013, China announced plans to formally change the One-Child policy, making it less stringent. The National People's Congress has changed the policy to allow couples to have two children, so long as one of the partners is an only child. This change was not sparked by sex ratios, but rather by an aging population that is causing the workforce to become increasingly smaller. It is estimated that this new law will lead to two million more births per year and could cause a baby boom in China. In 2015, China officially relaxed its one child law.<ref>{{Cite news | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-38714949 | title=China birth rate up after one-child change| work=BBC News| date=2017-01-23}}</ref> Unfortunately, many of China's social problems are based on overpopulation.

This has been applied to resource differences between individuals in a society and also to resource differences between societies. Empirical evidence is mixed with higher support in better studies according to Cronk in a 2007 review. One example, in a 1997 study, of a group with a preference for females was [[Romani people|Romani]] in [[Hungary]], a low status group. They \"had a female-biased sex ratio at birth, were more likely to abort a fetus after having had one or more daughters, nursed their daughters longer, and sent their daughters to school for longer.\"<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Cronk | first1 = L. | doi = 10.1016/S1472-6483(10)60546-9 | title = Boy or girl: Gender preferences from a Darwinian point of view | journal = Reproductive BioMedicine Online | volume = 15 | pages = 23\u201332 | year = 2007 | pmid =  18088517| pmc = }}</ref>\n\n== Societal effects ==\n\n=== Missing women ===\n{{Main|Missing women}}\nThe idea of \u201cmissing women\u201d was first suggested by Amartya Sen, one of the first scholars to study high sex ratios and their causes globally, in 1990. In order to illustrate the gravity of the situation, he calculated the number of women that were not alive because of sex-selective abortion or discriminatory practices. He found that there were 11 percent fewer women than there \u201cshould\u201d have been, if China had the natural sex ratio. This figure, when combined with statistics from around the world, led to a finding of over 100 million missing women. In other words, by the early 1990s, the number of missing women was \u201clarger than the combined casualties of all famines in the twentieth century\u201d (Sen 1990).<ref name= Sen1990 />\n\nThis has led to particular concern due to a critical shortage of wives.

New York: Academic Press; 1983. p. xi\u2013xiii.</ref>\n\nIt has been suggested by Belanger (2002) that sex-selective abortion may have positive effects on the mother choosing to abort the female fetus. This is related to the historical duty of mothers to produce a son in order to carry on the family name. As previously mentioned, women gain status in society when they have a male child, but not when they have a female child. Oftentimes, bearing of a son leads to greater legitimacy and agency for the mother. In some regions of the world where son preference is especially strong, sonless women are treated as outcasts. In this way, sex-selective abortion is a way for women to select for male fetuses, helping secure greater family status.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=B\u00e9langer |first1=Dani\u00e8le |title=Sex Selective Abortions: Short-term and Long-term Perspectives |journal=Reproductive Health Matters |date=May 2002 |volume=10 |issue=19 |pages=194\u2013197 |doi=10.1016/S0968-8080(02)00033-2 |pmid=12369329 |jstor=3775793 }}</ref>\n\nGoodkind (1999)<ref name=\"Goodkind\"/> argues that sex-selective abortion should not be banned purely because of its discriminatory nature. Instead, he argues, we must consider the overall lifetime possibilities of discrimination. In fact, it is possible that sex-selective abortion takes away much of the discrimination women would face later in life. Since families have the option of selecting for the fetal sex they desire, if they choose not to abort a female fetus, she is more likely to be valued later in life. In this way, sex-selective abortion may be a more humane alternative to infanticide, abandonment, or neglect. Goodkind (1999) poses an essential philosophical question, \u201cif a ban were enacted against prenatal sex testing (or the use of abortion for sex-selective purposes), how many excess postnatal deaths would a society be willing to tolerate in lieu of whatever sex-selective abortions were avoided?\u201d\n\n===Controversies===\nThere are many controversies surrounding sex-selective abortion.

However the ratio may deviate significantly from this range for natural reasons such as early marriage and fertility, teenage mothers, average maternal age at birth, paternal age, age gap between father and mother, late births, ethnicity, social and economic stress, warfare, environmental and hormonal effects.<ref name=James-JournalofEndocrinology /><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Graffelman | first1 = Jan | last2 = Hoekstra | first2 = Rolf F. | year = 2000 | title = A Statistical Analysis of the Effect of Warfare on the Human Secondary Sex Ratio | url = | journal = Human Biology | volume = 72 | issue = 3| pages = 433\u2013445 | pmid = 10885189 }}</ref> This school of scholars support their alternate hypothesis with historical data when modern sex-selection technologies were unavailable, as well as birth sex ratio in sub-regions, and various ethnic groups of developed economies.<ref name=rjhmam>{{cite journal | last1 = Jacobsen | first1 = R. | last2 = M\u00f8ller | first2 = H. | last3 = Mouritsen | first3 = A. | year = 1999 | title = Natural variation in the human sex ratio | url = | journal = Hum.

According to Zeng et al. (1993), the most prominent cause is probably sex-selective abortion, but this is difficult to prove that in a country with little reliable birth data because of the hiding of \"illegal\" (under the One-Child Policy) births.<ref name=zengyi93>{{cite journal | last1 = Yi | first1 = Zeng | display-authors = etal   | year = 1993 | title = Causes and implications of the recent increase in the reported sex ratio at birthin China | url = | journal = Population and Development Review | volume = 19 | issue = 2| pages = 283\u2013302 | doi=10.2307/2938438| jstor = 2938438 }}</ref>\n\nThese illegal births have led to underreporting of female infants. Zeng et al., using a reverse survival method, estimate that underreporting keeps about 2.26% male births and 5.94% female births off the books. Adjusting for unreported illegal births, they conclude that the corrected Chinese sex ratio at birth for 1989 was 111 rather than 115.<ref name=zengyi93 /> These national averages over time, mask the regional sex ratio data. For example, in some provinces such as [[Anhui]], [[Jiangxi]], [[Shaanxi]], [[Hunan]] and [[Guangdong]], sex ratio at birth is more than 130.<ref>Tania Branigan, [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/nov/02/chinas-great-gender-crisis China's Great Gender Crisis] The Guardian, UK, 2 November 2011</ref><ref name=Hesketh />\n\nTraditional Chinese techniques have been used to determine sex for hundreds of years, primarily with unknown accuracy. It was not until [[ultrasonography]] became widely available in urban and rural China that sex was able to be determined scientifically. In 1986, the Ministry of Health posted the Notice on Forbidding Prenatal Sex Determination, but it was not widely followed.<ref>Ministry of Health and State Family Planning Commission.1986. \"Notice on strictly forbidding prenatal sex determination,\" reprinted in Peng Peiyun(ed.), 1997, Family Planning Encyclopedia of China.

Beijing: China Population Press, pp. 959\u2013960.</ref>\n\nHowever, many people have personal connections to medical practitioners and strong [[son preference]] still dominates culture, leading to the widespread use of sex determination techniques.<ref name=Junhong /> According to Hardy, Gu, and Xie (2000), ultrasound has spread to all areas of China, as evidenced by the spread of the high sex ratio throughout the country.<ref name=Xie>Hardee, Karen, Gu Baochang, and Xie Zhenming. 2000. \"Holding up more than half the sky:Fertility control and women's empowerment in China,\"paper presented at the Annual Meeting of the Population Association of America, 23\u201325 March, Los Angeles.</ref>\n\nHardy, Gu, and Xie suggest sex-selective abortion is more prevalent in rural China because son preference is much stronger there.<ref name=Xie /> Urban areas of China, on average, are moving toward greater equality for both sexes, while rural China tends to follow more traditional views of gender. This is partially due to the belief that, while sons are always part of the family, daughters are only temporary, going to a new family when they marry. Additionally, if a woman's firstborn child is a son, her position in society moves up, while the same is not true of a firstborn daughter.<ref name= Junhong />\n\nIn the past, desire for a son was manifested by large birth rates\u2014many couples would continue to have children until they had a son.<ref name=Junhong /> However, the combination of financial concerns and, more importantly, the One-child policy (discussed further below) have led to an increase in gender planning and selection. Even in rural areas, most women know that ultrasonography can be used for gender discernment. For each subsequent birth, Junhong found that women are over 10% more likely to have an ultrasound (39% for firstborn, 55% for second born, 67% for third born). Additionally, he found that the sex of the firstborn child impacts whether a woman will have an ultrasound in her subsequent pregnancies: 40% of women with a firstborn son have an ultrasound for their second born child, versus 70% of women with firstborn daughters. This points to a strong desire to select for a son if one has not been born yet.<ref name=Junhong />\n\n[[File:Sex ratio at birth in mainland China.png|thumb|450px|Birth sex ratios have dramatically changed in China since the implementation of the [[One-Child Policy]].]]\nBecause of the lack of data about childbirth, a number of researchers have worked to learn about abortion statistics in China. One of the earliest studies by Qui (1987) found that according to cultural belief, fetuses are not thought of as human beings until they are born, leading to a cultural preference for abortion over infanticide.<ref>Qiu Renzong. 1987. Life Ethics Shanghai:ShanghaiPeople'sPress</ref> In fact, [[infanticide]] and infant abandonment are rather rare in China today.<ref name= Junhong /> Instead, Junhong found that roughly 27% of women have an abortion.

A study carried out at a Massachusetts infertility clinic shows that the majority of couples using these techniques, such as [[Preimplantation genetic diagnosis]] came from a Chinese or Asian background.

In 35 countries, claims Bongaarts, the desired birth sex ratio in respective countries would be more than 110 boys for every 100 girls if parents in these countries had a child matching their preferred gender (higher than India's, which The Economist claims is 108).<ref name=teconomist />\n\n== Estimates of missing women ==\nEstimates of implied missing girls, considering the \"normal\" birth sex ratio to be the 103\u2013107 range, vary considerably between researchers and underlying assumptions for expected post-birth mortality rates for men and women.

As MacPherson (2007) notes, there can be significant differences in gender violence and access to food, healthcare, immunizations between male and female children. This leads to high infant and childhood mortality among girls, which causes changes in sex ratio.<ref name=macpherson />\n\nDisparate, gendered access to resources appears to be strongly linked to socioeconomic status. Specifically, poorer families are sometimes forced to ration food, with daughters typically receiving less priority than sons.<ref name= KlausenWink /> However, Klasen's 2001 study revealed that this practice is less common in the poorest families, but rises dramatically in the slightly less poor families.<ref name= KlausenWink /> Klasen and Wink's 2003 study suggests that this is \"related to greater female economic independence and fewer cultural strictures among the poorest sections of the population\". In other words, the poorest families are typically less bound by cultural expectations and norms, and women tend to have more freedom to become family breadwinners out of necessity.<ref name= KlausenWink />\n\nIncreased sex ratios can be caused by disparities in aspects of life other than vital resources. According to Sen (1990), differences in wages and job advancement also have a dramatic effect on sex ratios. This is why high sex ratios are sometimes seen in nations with little sex-selective abortion.<ref name= Sen1990 /> Additionally, high female education rates are correlated with lower sex ratios (World Bank 2011).<ref>World Bank, Engendering Development, The World Bank, (2001)</ref>\n\nLopez and Ruzikah (1983) found that, when given the same resources, women tend to outlive men at all stages of life after infancy. However, globally, resources are not always allocated equitably. Thus, some scholars argue that disparities in access to resources such as healthcare, education, and nutrition play at least a small role in the high sex ratios seen in some parts of the world.<ref name= KlausenWink /> For example, Alderman and Gerter (1997) found that unequal access to healthcare is a primary cause of female death in developing nations, especially in Southeast Asia. Moreover, in India, lack of equal access to healthcare has led to increased disease and higher rates of female mortality in every age group until the late thirties (Sen 1990). This is particularly noteworthy because, in regions of the world where women receive equal resources, women tend to outlive men (Sen 1990). Women outlive men in all but 2 countries.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.cmet.2016.05.019 |pmid=27304504 |pmc=4932837 |title=Sex Differences in Lifespan |journal=Cell Metabolism |volume=23 |issue=6 |pages=1022\u20131033 |year=2016 |last1=Austad |first1=Steven N. |last2=Fischer |first2=Kathleen E. }}</ref>\n\nEconomic disadvantage alone may not always lead to increased sex ratio, claimed Sen in 1990. For example, in sub-Saharan Africa, one of the most economically disadvantaged regions of the world, there is an excess of women. So, if economic disadvantage is uncorrelated with sex ratio in Africa, some other factor(s) may be at play.<ref name= Sen1990 /> More detailed analysis of African demographics, in 2002, suggests that Africa too has wide variation in birth sex ratios (from 1.01 in Bantu populations of East Africa to 1.08 in Nigeria and Ethiopia).<ref name=pmid12617497/> Thus economic disadvantage remains a possible unresolved hypothesis for Africa as well.\n\n== Reasons for sex-selective abortion ==\nVarious theories have been proposed as possible reasons for sex-selective abortion. Culture rather than economic conditions is favored by some researchers because such deviations in sex ratios do not exist in [[sub-Saharan Africa]], [[Latin America]], and the [[Caribbean]].<ref name=\"Gettis\" /> Other hypotheses include disparate gender-biased access to resources,<ref name=macpherson /> and attempts to control population growth such as using one child policy.<ref name=Hesketh />\n\nSome demographers question whether sex-selective abortion or infanticide claims are accurate, because underreporting of female births may also explain high sex ratios.<ref>{{cite journal | doi=10.2307/1972351 | title=The missing girls of China: a new demographic account | last=Johansson | first=Sten | last2=Nygren | jstor=1972351 | first2=Olga | year=1991 | volume=17 | issue=1 | journal = Population and Development Review | pages=35\u201351}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | title=Are births underreported in rural China? | first=M.

Generally, before the [[information era]], male babies were preferred because they provided manual labor and continuation of the family [[Lineage (anthropology)|lineage]]. Labor is still important in developing nations as China and India, but when it comes to family lineage, it is of great importance.\n\nThe selective abortion of female fetuses is most common in areas where cultural norms value male children over female children for a variety of social and economic reasons.<ref name=\"Goodkind\" /> A son is often preferred as an \"asset\" since he can earn and support the family; a daughter is a \"liability\" since she will be married off to another family, and so will not contribute financially to her parents.

During the 19th century, in the Northwest [[British raj|British India]], one-fourth of the population preserved only half the daughters, while other 3/4th of the population had balanced sex ratio. There were 118 males per 100 females. This is comparable to the contemporary sex ratio in the area, now divided between India and Pakistan.<ref>{{cite book|title = Child Survival: Anthropological Perspectives on the Treatment and Maltreatment of Children|last = Hughes|first = Nancy Scheper|publisher = Springer|isbn = 9781556080289|year = 1987|page = 99}}</ref>\n\n[[Chinese culture]] is deeply patriarchal. Pre-modern Chinese society was predominantly patriarchal and patrilineal from at least the 11th century BC onwards.{{sfnp|Wu|2009|p=86}} There has long been a son preference in China, leading to high rates of female infanticide, as well as a strong tradition of restricting the [[freedom of movement]] of women, particularly upper-class women, manifested through the practice of [[foot binding]]. Although the legal and social standing of women have greatly improved in the 20th century, son preference remains still strong, and the situation was aggravated by the [[one child policy]].\n\nInterpretations of [[Confucianism]] have been argued to contribute to the low status of women. The gender roles prescribed in the [[Three Obediences and Four Virtues]] became a cornerstone of the family, and thus, societal stability. Starting from the Han period, Confucians began to teach that a virtuous woman was supposed to follow the males in her family: the father before her marriage, the husband after she marries, and her sons in widowhood. In the later dynasties, more emphasis was placed on the virtue of chastity. The Song dynasty Confucian [[Cheng Yi (philosopher)|Cheng Yi]] stated that: \"To starve to death is a small matter, but to lose one's chastity is a great matter.\"<ref name=\"ebrey\">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GDPskRXfl5cC&pg=PA10&lpg=PA10#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Women and the Family in Chinese History|author= Patricia Buckley Ebrey |pages=10\u201312|publisher=Routledge |date=19 September 2002 |isbn= 978-0415288224}}</ref> The \"cult of chastity\" accordingly, condemned many widows to poverty and loneliness by placing a social stigma on remarriage.<ref name=Adler>{{cite web | last = Adler | first = Joseph A. | title = Daughter/Wife/Mother or Sage/Immortal/Bodhisattva?

Dowry is an ancient practice, that has been common in many cultures around the world, and which is today prevalent especially in South Asia. The custom of dowry is most common in cultures that are strongly [[patrilineal]] and that expect women to reside with or near their husband's family ([[patrilocality]]).<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/dowry | title=Dowry &#124; marriage custom}}</ref>\n\nKirti Singh states that dowry is widely considered to be both a cause and a consequence of son preference, and this may lead to girls being unwanted, sex selective abortion, [[female infanticide]] or abuse of female children.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20140313094849/http://india.unfpa.org/drive/LawsandSonPreferenceinIndia.pdf</ref>\n\nThe [[dowry system in India]] is a major part of [[Indian culture]] and refers to the durable goods, cash, and real or movable property that the bride's family gives to the bridegroom, his parents, or his relatives as a condition of the marriage.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title = Dowry Deaths and Access to Justice in Kali's Yug: Empowerment, Law and Dowry Deaths|last = Rani Jethmalani & P.K.

In the early years of the Republic, leaders believed that telling citizens to reduce their fertility was enough, repealing laws banning [[contraception]] and instead promoting its use. However, the contraceptives were not widely available, both because of lack of supply and because of cultural taboo against discussing sex. Efforts were slowed following the famine of 1959\u201361 but were resumed shortly thereafter with virtually the same results. Then, in 1964, the Family Planning Office was established to enforce stricter guidelines regarding fertility and it was moderately successful.<ref>Henneberger, S. \"China's One-Child Policy.\" : History. N.p., 2007. Web. 24 Nov. 2013.</ref>\n\nIn 1979, the government adopted the [[One-Child Policy]], which limited many families to one child, unless specified by provincial regulations. It was instituted as an attempt to boost the Chinese economy. Under it, families who break rules regarding the number of children they are allowed are given various punishments (primarily monetary), dependent upon the province in which they live.<ref>\"History of the One-Child Policy.\" All Girls Allowed, 2013. Web. 25 Nov. 2013.</ref>\n\nAs stated above, the sex ratios of a province are largely determined by the type of restriction placed upon the family, pointing to the conclusion that much of the imbalance in sex ratio in China can be attributed to the policy. Research by Junhong (2001) found that many parents are willing to pay to ensure that their child is male (especially if their first child is female), but will not do the same to ensure their child is female.<ref name=Junhong /> Likely, fear of the harsh monetary punishments of the One-Child Policy make ensuring a son's birth a smart investment. Therefore, son's cultural and economic importance to families and the large expenses associated with multiple children are primary factors leading to China's disparate sex ratio.\n\nIn 2013, China announced plans to formally change the One-Child policy, making it less stringent. The National People's Congress has changed the policy to allow couples to have two children, so long as one of the partners is an only child. This change was not sparked by sex ratios, but rather by an aging population that is causing the workforce to become increasingly smaller. It is estimated that this new law will lead to two million more births per year and could cause a baby boom in China. In 2015, China officially relaxed its one child law.<ref>{{Cite news | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-38714949 | title=China birth rate up after one-child change| work=BBC News| date=2017-01-23}}</ref> Unfortunately, many of China's social problems are based on overpopulation.

This has been applied to resource differences between individuals in a society and also to resource differences between societies. Empirical evidence is mixed with higher support in better studies according to Cronk in a 2007 review. One example, in a 1997 study, of a group with a preference for females was [[Romani people|Romani]] in [[Hungary]], a low status group. They \"had a female-biased sex ratio at birth, were more likely to abort a fetus after having had one or more daughters, nursed their daughters longer, and sent their daughters to school for longer.\"<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Cronk | first1 = L. | doi = 10.1016/S1472-6483(10)60546-9 | title = Boy or girl: Gender preferences from a Darwinian point of view | journal = Reproductive BioMedicine Online | volume = 15 | pages = 23\u201332 | year = 2007 | pmid =  18088517| pmc = }}</ref>\n\n== Societal effects ==\n\n=== Missing women ===\n{{Main|Missing women}}\nThe idea of \u201cmissing women\u201d was first suggested by Amartya Sen, one of the first scholars to study high sex ratios and their causes globally, in 1990. In order to illustrate the gravity of the situation, he calculated the number of women that were not alive because of sex-selective abortion or discriminatory practices. He found that there were 11 percent fewer women than there \u201cshould\u201d have been, if China had the natural sex ratio. This figure, when combined with statistics from around the world, led to a finding of over 100 million missing women. In other words, by the early 1990s, the number of missing women was \u201clarger than the combined casualties of all famines in the twentieth century\u201d (Sen 1990).<ref name= Sen1990 />\n\nThis has led to particular concern due to a critical shortage of wives.

New York: Academic Press; 1983. p. xi\u2013xiii.</ref>\n\nIt has been suggested by Belanger (2002) that sex-selective abortion may have positive effects on the mother choosing to abort the female fetus. This is related to the historical duty of mothers to produce a son in order to carry on the family name. As previously mentioned, women gain status in society when they have a male child, but not when they have a female child. Oftentimes, bearing of a son leads to greater legitimacy and agency for the mother. In some regions of the world where son preference is especially strong, sonless women are treated as outcasts. In this way, sex-selective abortion is a way for women to select for male fetuses, helping secure greater family status.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=B\u00e9langer |first1=Dani\u00e8le |title=Sex Selective Abortions: Short-term and Long-term Perspectives |journal=Reproductive Health Matters |date=May 2002 |volume=10 |issue=19 |pages=194\u2013197 |doi=10.1016/S0968-8080(02)00033-2 |pmid=12369329 |jstor=3775793 }}</ref>\n\nGoodkind (1999)<ref name=\"Goodkind\"/> argues that sex-selective abortion should not be banned purely because of its discriminatory nature. Instead, he argues, we must consider the overall lifetime possibilities of discrimination. In fact, it is possible that sex-selective abortion takes away much of the discrimination women would face later in life. Since families have the option of selecting for the fetal sex they desire, if they choose not to abort a female fetus, she is more likely to be valued later in life. In this way, sex-selective abortion may be a more humane alternative to infanticide, abandonment, or neglect. Goodkind (1999) poses an essential philosophical question, \u201cif a ban were enacted against prenatal sex testing (or the use of abortion for sex-selective purposes), how many excess postnatal deaths would a society be willing to tolerate in lieu of whatever sex-selective abortions were avoided?\u201d\n\n===Controversies===\nThere are many controversies surrounding sex-selective abortion.

The city itself has gone through a process of modernization, but most of the surrounding area remains agricultural. Mirpur is known for its grand buildings and large bungalows, primarily funded through its [[expatriate]] community, which comes mainly from [[Europe]] (especially the [[United Kingdom]]), [[Hong Kong]], the [[Middle East]], and North America. The main crop cultivated during summer is [[millet]] and pulses. However, other crops such as wheat, maize and vegetables are also grown.  The produce of quality rice from the paddy fields of [[Khari Sharif]], between Upper Jhelum Canal and [[Jhelum]] river, is very famous and popular for its aroma and taste. The production of electricity from [[Mangla Dam]] provides the energy needs for Azad Jammu and Kashmir and Northern Punjab.\n\nA significant portion of the population from the district, the [[Mirpuri diaspora]], migrated to the United Kingdom in the mid-to-late 1950s and in the early 1960s, mostly to [[West Yorkshire]], [[East Midlands]], [[West Midlands (county)|West Midlands]], [[Luton]], [[Peterborough]], [[Derby]] and [[East London]]. Mirpur is thus sometimes known as \"Little England\".<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-17156238 |publisher=[[BBC News]] |title=How city of Mirpur became 'Little England' |first=Aleem |last=Maqbool |date=March 5, 2012 |quote=The city of Mirpur, in Pakistan-administered Kashmir, is known as \"Little England\" due to its large British Pakistani community.}}</ref> Many British products are found, and many shops in the city accept the [[pound sterling]].<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-17249424 | work=BBC News | title=Inside Pakistan's 'Little Britain' as overseas nationals get vote | date=4 March 2012}}</ref>\n\n==History ==\nThe area that is now Mirpur has always been a crossroad for major invasions of [[South Asia]], and has formed part of various empires over time including the role of an outlying region of the conquests of [[Alexander the Great]], the Kingdom of [[Gandhara]], the [[Mauryan Empire]], the [[Kushan]] empire, the [[Sultanate]] of Ghazni, the [[Delhi Sultanate]] and the [[Mughal empire]] amongst others.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nThe city of Mirpur itself was founded in around 1640 AD or 1050AH by the Ghakhar chief Miran Shah Ghazi. The Imperial Gazetteer of India Provincial Series Kashmir and Jammu (1909) reports that \"it is said to have been founded by Miran Shah Ghazi and Sultan Fateh Khan\". An alternate view is that the city was founded by Mira Shah Gazi and Gosain Bodhpuri, both regarded as saints. The word 'Mir' was taken from the name of the former and 'Pur\u2019 from the latter.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kdfajk.org/Azad%20Kashmir%20and%20independencepolitics.pdf|title=Azad Kashmir - Kashmiri Development Foundation|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nIn 997 CE, [[Mahmud of Ghazni|Sultan Mahmud Ghaznavi]], took over the [[Ghaznavids|Ghaznavid dynasty]] empire established by his father, [[Sabuktigin|Sultan Sebuktegin]]. He conquered the [[Shahi]]s in [[Kabul]] in 1005. The [[Delhi Sultanate]] and later [[Mughal Empire]] ruled the region. The Punjab region became predominantly [[Muslim]] due to [[missionary]] [[Sufi]] saints, whose [[dargah]]s dot its landscape\n\nThe area that is now Mirpur has been historically associated with [[Pothohar Plateau|Pothohar]], though the modern demarcation of [[Potohar]] devised by the British excludes Mirpur, by using the [[Jhelum]] river as its eastern boundary. By the end of the 18th century, Gakhar power in Pothohar had declined. Mirpur had become part of Chibb, which ruled the state of Khari Khariyali with its capital at Mangla Fort. With the rise of the Sikh power in the [[Punjab region|Punjab]], Maharaja [[Ranjit Singh]] established his supremacy and set his eyes on the Chibh states of Bhimber and Khari Khariyali. In 1810, a force was sent against Raja Sultan Khan of Bhimber and was met with fierce resistance. However, in 1812 another Sikh army under prince [[Kharak Singh]] defeated Sultan [[Khan (title)|Khan]], and the [[Bhimber]] state was annexed as Jagir of Kharak Singh. Around the same time, Ranjit Singh acquired Gujrat and invaded Khari Khariyali, then ruled by Raja Umar Khan. Raja Umar Khan made peace with Ranjit Singh; but before a settlement could be made, he died, and the state and Mirpur became part of Ranjit Singh's territories.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">History of Panjab Hill States, Hutchison, Vogel 1933</ref>\n\nIn 1808, Ranjit Singh annexed Jammu state, which was already a tributary since 1780, and in 1820 awarded Jammu to his commander [[Gulab Singh of Jammu and Kashmir|Gulab Singh]], who hailed from Jammu and had been under the service of Ranjit Singh for the past eight years. Between 1831\u201339 Ranjit Singh bestowed on Gulab Singh the royalty of the salt mines in northern Punjab, and the northern Punjab towns including [[Bhera]], [[Jhelum]], [[Rohtas, Pakistan|Rohtas]], Mirpur and [[Gujrat city|Gujrat]]. Gulab Singh kept on expanding his kingdom, and in 1840 Baltistan was made subject to Jammu while Gilgit fell to a Sikh force from Kashmir in 1842. The state of Kashmir was annexed by Ranjit Singh in 1819. However, the rebellion in [[Hazara, Pakistan|Hazara]] in the beginning of 1846 compelled the country to be transferred to Raja Gulab Singh of Jammu as well.\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Shrine of Meeran Shah-001.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Shrine of Meeran Shah]] -->\nAs an aftermath of the [[First Anglo-Sikh War]] and the [[Treaty of Lahore]], The [[Treaty of Amritsar, 1846|Treaty of Amritsar]] was signed between the British East India company and Raja Gulab Singh of Jammu on March 16, 1846. The British Government sold Kashmir to the Raja of Jammu for 75 lakhs Nanak Shahi Rupees. This treaty transferred him all the hill states between Ravi and Indus. The transfer included Kashmir, Hazara and the southern hill states (including former Khari Khariyali Thus sealing the fate of Mirpur with the new state of Jammu and Kashmir.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n===Early Mirpur===\nSince Mirpur lies in between where the [[Jhelum River]] meets the heavily forested foothills of the [[Pir Panjal Range|Pir Panjal]] mountains and above the plains of the largely treeless Punjab, it was an ideal spot for the construction of the boats used to carry goods from the Himalayas down the five rivers of the Punjab to the [[Indus River]] and onto the seaports in the Indus delta. Traders have been operating from there across the [[Indian Ocean]] for over three thousand years. Most of the crew on the boats trading up and down the Punjab and Indus River system were drawn from Mirpur, as training as a boat-builder was a necessary prerequisite for becoming a boatman.<ref>{{citation |last=Ballard |first=Roger |chapter=The South Asian presence in Britain and its transnational connections |title=Culture and economy in the Indian diaspora |year=2003 |pp=197\u2013222 |chapter-url=http://crossasia-repository.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/250/1/southasianbritain.pdf}}</ref>\n\n===British Dominion===\nDuring the modern period of the Dogra principality, a British dominion, the thriving river trade diminished due to the construction of railway lines from [[Mumbai|Bombay]] and [[Karachi]] into the interior of the Punjab.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}} Moving goods by modern rail lines was both cheaper and quicker, and hundreds of Mirpuri boatmen found themselves out of a job.\n\nAt the same time long-distance ocean trade was shifting from sail to steam. There was a huge demand for men who were prepared to work in the hot, dirty and dangerous stokeholds of the new coal-fired steamers. British seamen avoided such jobs whenever they possibly could.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}} They preferred to work on deck. But in the 1870s Mirpuri ex-river boatmen  were desperately searching for a new source of income.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}} Although unfamiliar with stoking coal-fired boilers, they were prepared to learn and quickly gained jobs as engine-room stokers on new steamships sailing out of Karachi and Bombay, a position they retained until coal-fired ships were finally phased out of service at the end of the Second World War. Many Mirpuris also fought in the Indian Army in Burma during the Second World War.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\n===Postwar===\nAfter World War II, a new set of opportunities opened up. Britain's economy was just starting what proved to be a long postwar boom, and there was an acute short of labour in the foundries of the [[English Midlands]] and in the textile mills of [[Yorkshire]] and [[Lancashire]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}} Now it was the turn of ex-seamen to become industrial workers in Britain.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}} In 1960, when the Mangla Dam was about to be constructed, those who were going to be deprived of their agricultural land were afforded the opportunity to migrate to the United Kingdom and to join their relatives, who long established themselves in Britain.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\nAlthough one major reason for the outflow was the construction of the [[Mangla Dam]], but long before the construction of dam, a sizable Mirpuri community already existed in the UK.\n\nNow It is a part of Indian Political Map and Pakistan is illegally occupied.\n\n==Mirpur City ==\n\nMirpur City is at 459 m above sea level and is linked with the main [[Peshawar]]-[[Lahore]] Grand Trunk Road at [[Dina (town)|Dina Tehsil]]. It is the headquarters of Mirpur District, which has two subdivisions: Mirpur and Dadyal. Mirpur is now one of the largest city of Azad Kashmir.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20091027084826/http://www.geocities.com/sam4mobile/Dadyal-Thumbnail-view.html Internet Archive Wayback Machine].

The project of four-star hotel PC has been completed. The government is planning to make the second rotating hotel of Pakistan in Mirpur, Azad Kashmir.\n\nIn fact, the remains of the old city (Old Mirpur) are under the waters of the Mangla Lake, bit during the colder months of March and April, the water level recedes to such an extent that one can travel on motorcycle on the old Mirpur, road which still exists. The holy shrines of Syed Abdul Karim and Meeran Shah Ghazi then become visible and so do the remnants of a Sikh [[gurdwara]] as well as a Hindu [[Hindu temple|Mandir]], possibly dedicated to the \"Mangla Mata\" (Mangla mother goddess). The remains of old houses, water wells and graveyards reappear as well.\n\nPeople from surrounding areas visit old Mirpur to pay homage to their ancient land on which they lived and pray on the graveyards of their loved ones. Urs Mubarak of Meeran Shah and Syed Abdul Kareem are also arranged in Old Mirpur.\n\nThe remains of Old Mirpur depict a silhouette of pre-[[Partition of India|Independence]] city, when many faiths coexisted. However, after division of the State of Jammu Kashmir, the non-Muslim community (Hindus, Buddhists and Sikhs) fled to Jammu.\n\nNew Mirpur was well planned, and modern buildings and ample roads serve each part of city. The affluence from emigration mainly to the UK is reflected by the structure and grandiose of the residential houses. There are telltale signs of inward investment by the expatriate community living in the United Kingdom, Europe, North America and the [[Middle East]]. There are a number of good hotels, restaurants, shopping malls and other urban facilities.\n\n==Agriculture==\nMost of the area's bushy landscapes, stretching from Bhimber to Dadyal, are barren, leaving only a small stretch of fertile land but there is highly-productive land near water. One crop cultivated during the spring/summer season is millet. Also, a few farms grow vegetables and wheat, especially when the dam water subsides during the winter season.\n\n==Industry==\nThe government of Azad Jammu and Kashmir has successfully developed Mirpur industrially and promoted private investment in a diverse economy: [[foam]], polypropylene, synthetic yarn, motorbikes and scooter, textile, vegetable oil (ghee), wood and sawmills, soap, [[cosmetics]], [[marble]], ready-made garments, matches and rosin, [[turpentine]]. The economy of Mirpur generated economy of Azad Kashmir. However, much of the infrastructure still needs improvement so that high-quality products can be obtained.\n\nAs part of the relief/compensation package in the wake of Mangla Dam, a new city is being developed along the southeastern outskirts of Mirpur, with the main city of Mirpur being doubled. Much construction is occurring around the whole district by Pakistani and Chinese contractors, raising the dam. Four towns in the district have been planned near the new city to resettle the population affected by the project.\n\n==Education ==\n[[English language|English]] is common in educational institutes.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}} Previously, the [[University of Azad Jammu & Kashmir]] was the only institution for higher studies but there have been significant changes in the educational infrastructure. The [[Mirpur University of Science and Technology]] (MUST), the [[Mirpur University of Science and Technology#Akson College of Health Sciences|Akson College of Health Science]] and the [[Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto Shaheed Medical College]] have been formed.\n\nThe [[AJK Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education, Mirpur]] is responsible for the studies at lower levels. In addition to the state-run schools and colleges, Mirpur has a well-developed private sector providing the education to all sections of the society:\n\nOther notable colleges and schools include:\n<!-- ONLY ADD A NAME TO THIS LIST IF IT ALREADY HAS A WIKIPEDIA ARTICLE-->\n* [[The City School (Pakistan)|The City School]]\n* [[Mohi ud Din Islamic Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences]]\n* [[Mohi-ud-Din Islamic Medical College]]\n* [[Punjab College]], Mirpur\n\n== Media ==\n{{expand section|date=February 2019}}\nElectronic and print media are rapidly increasing in number.

Mirpur has a cricket stadium, [[Quaid-e-Azam Stadium]].\n\nThere are registered sports clubs:A-5 Cricket Club, Al-Siraj Cricket Club, South Asia Cricket Club, Pilot Football Club, Youth Football Club and Kashmir National FC.\n\nThe district football team of Mirpur take part in the All [[Azad Jammu and Kashmir]] football championships.\n\n==Transport==\n[[CNG]] auto rickshaws are very  popular mode of transport for short routes within the city. The city's transport system links it to a number of destinations in [[Azad Kashmir]] notably [[Bhimber]], Jatlan, [[Chakswari]], [[Dadyal]], [[Kotli]] and [[Khoi Ratta]] and to major cities in [[Pakistan]] as well as including services to [[Gujrat city|Gujrat]], [[Jhelum]], [[Kharian]], [[Gujranwala]], [[Lahore]] and [[Rawalpindi]].\nThere is no railway station in Mirpur. The closest station is in Dina.

Refugees from Jhelum in Western Punjab had taken refuge in Mirpur town, causing the non-Muslim population to increase to 25,000. On 25 November 1947, tribesmen and Pakistani military members moved into the town, seizing the city. Of the minority population, only about 2,500 Hindus or Sikhs escaped to the Jammu and Kashmir along with the State troops. The remainder were marched to Alibeg, where a gurdwara was converted into a prison camp, but the raiders killed 10,000 of the captives along the way and abducted 5,000 women. Only about 5,000 made it to Alibeg, but they continued to be killed at a gradual pace by the captors. In March 1948, the [[ICRC]] rescued 1,600 of the survivors from Alibeg, who were resettled to [[Jammu]] and other areas of India.

The city itself has gone through a process of modernization, but most of the surrounding area remains agricultural. Mirpur is known for its grand buildings and large bungalows, primarily funded through its [[expatriate]] community, which comes mainly from [[Europe]] (especially the [[United Kingdom]]), [[Hong Kong]], the [[Middle East]], and North America. The main crop cultivated during summer is [[millet]] and pulses. However, other crops such as wheat, maize and vegetables are also grown.  The produce of quality rice from the paddy fields of [[Khari Sharif]], between Upper Jhelum Canal and [[Jhelum]] river, is very famous and popular for its aroma and taste. The production of electricity from [[Mangla Dam]] provides the energy needs for Azad Jammu and Kashmir and Northern Punjab.\n\nA significant portion of the population from the district, the [[Mirpuri diaspora]], migrated to the United Kingdom in the mid-to-late 1950s and in the early 1960s, mostly to [[West Yorkshire]], [[East Midlands]], [[West Midlands (county)|West Midlands]], [[Luton]], [[Peterborough]], [[Derby]] and [[East London]]. Mirpur is thus sometimes known as \"Little England\".<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-17156238 |publisher=[[BBC News]] |title=How city of Mirpur became 'Little England' |first=Aleem |last=Maqbool |date=March 5, 2012 |quote=The city of Mirpur, in Pakistan-administered Kashmir, is known as \"Little England\" due to its large British Pakistani community.}}</ref> Many British products are found, and many shops in the city accept the [[pound sterling]].<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-17249424 | work=BBC News | title=Inside Pakistan's 'Little Britain' as overseas nationals get vote | date=4 March 2012}}</ref>\n\n==History ==\nThe area that is now Mirpur has always been a crossroad for major invasions of [[South Asia]], and has formed part of various empires over time including the role of an outlying region of the conquests of [[Alexander the Great]], the Kingdom of [[Gandhara]], the [[Mauryan Empire]], the [[Kushan]] empire, the [[Sultanate]] of Ghazni, the [[Delhi Sultanate]] and the [[Mughal empire]] amongst others.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nThe city of Mirpur itself was founded in around 1640 AD or 1050AH by the Ghakhar chief Miran Shah Ghazi. The Imperial Gazetteer of India Provincial Series Kashmir and Jammu (1909) reports that \"it is said to have been founded by Miran Shah Ghazi and Sultan Fateh Khan\". An alternate view is that the city was founded by Mira Shah Gazi and Gosain Bodhpuri, both regarded as saints. The word 'Mir' was taken from the name of the former and 'Pur\u2019 from the latter.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kdfajk.org/Azad%20Kashmir%20and%20independencepolitics.pdf|title=Azad Kashmir - Kashmiri Development Foundation|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nIn 997 CE, [[Mahmud of Ghazni|Sultan Mahmud Ghaznavi]], took over the [[Ghaznavids|Ghaznavid dynasty]] empire established by his father, [[Sabuktigin|Sultan Sebuktegin]]. He conquered the [[Shahi]]s in [[Kabul]] in 1005. The [[Delhi Sultanate]] and later [[Mughal Empire]] ruled the region. The Punjab region became predominantly [[Muslim]] due to [[missionary]] [[Sufi]] saints, whose [[dargah]]s dot its landscape\n\nThe area that is now Mirpur has been historically associated with [[Pothohar Plateau|Pothohar]], though the modern demarcation of [[Potohar]] devised by the British excludes Mirpur, by using the [[Jhelum]] river as its eastern boundary. By the end of the 18th century, Gakhar power in Pothohar had declined. Mirpur had become part of Chibb, which ruled the state of Khari Khariyali with its capital at Mangla Fort. With the rise of the Sikh power in the [[Punjab region|Punjab]], Maharaja [[Ranjit Singh]] established his supremacy and set his eyes on the Chibh states of Bhimber and Khari Khariyali. In 1810, a force was sent against Raja Sultan Khan of Bhimber and was met with fierce resistance. However, in 1812 another Sikh army under prince [[Kharak Singh]] defeated Sultan [[Khan (title)|Khan]], and the [[Bhimber]] state was annexed as Jagir of Kharak Singh. Around the same time, Ranjit Singh acquired Gujrat and invaded Khari Khariyali, then ruled by Raja Umar Khan. Raja Umar Khan made peace with Ranjit Singh; but before a settlement could be made, he died, and the state and Mirpur became part of Ranjit Singh's territories.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">History of Panjab Hill States, Hutchison, Vogel 1933</ref>\n\nIn 1808, Ranjit Singh annexed Jammu state, which was already a tributary since 1780, and in 1820 awarded Jammu to his commander [[Gulab Singh of Jammu and Kashmir|Gulab Singh]], who hailed from Jammu and had been under the service of Ranjit Singh for the past eight years. Between 1831\u201339 Ranjit Singh bestowed on Gulab Singh the royalty of the salt mines in northern Punjab, and the northern Punjab towns including [[Bhera]], [[Jhelum]], [[Rohtas, Pakistan|Rohtas]], Mirpur and [[Gujrat city|Gujrat]]. Gulab Singh kept on expanding his kingdom, and in 1840 Baltistan was made subject to Jammu while Gilgit fell to a Sikh force from Kashmir in 1842. The state of Kashmir was annexed by Ranjit Singh in 1819. However, the rebellion in [[Hazara, Pakistan|Hazara]] in the beginning of 1846 compelled the country to be transferred to Raja Gulab Singh of Jammu as well.\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Shrine of Meeran Shah-001.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Shrine of Meeran Shah]] -->\nAs an aftermath of the [[First Anglo-Sikh War]] and the [[Treaty of Lahore]], The [[Treaty of Amritsar, 1846|Treaty of Amritsar]] was signed between the British East India company and Raja Gulab Singh of Jammu on March 16, 1846. The British Government sold Kashmir to the Raja of Jammu for 75 lakhs Nanak Shahi Rupees. This treaty transferred him all the hill states between Ravi and Indus. The transfer included Kashmir, Hazara and the southern hill states (including former Khari Khariyali Thus sealing the fate of Mirpur with the new state of Jammu and Kashmir.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n===Early Mirpur===\nSince Mirpur lies in between where the [[Jhelum River]] meets the heavily forested foothills of the [[Pir Panjal Range|Pir Panjal]] mountains and above the plains of the largely treeless Punjab, it was an ideal spot for the construction of the boats used to carry goods from the Himalayas down the five rivers of the Punjab to the [[Indus River]] and onto the seaports in the Indus delta. Traders have been operating from there across the [[Indian Ocean]] for over three thousand years. Most of the crew on the boats trading up and down the Punjab and Indus River system were drawn from Mirpur, as training as a boat-builder was a necessary prerequisite for becoming a boatman.<ref>{{citation |last=Ballard |first=Roger |chapter=The South Asian presence in Britain and its transnational connections |title=Culture and economy in the Indian diaspora |year=2003 |pp=197\u2013222 |chapter-url=http://crossasia-repository.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/250/1/southasianbritain.pdf}}</ref>\n\n===British Dominion===\nDuring the modern period of the Dogra principality, a British dominion, the thriving river trade diminished due to the construction of railway lines from [[Mumbai|Bombay]] and [[Karachi]] into the interior of the Punjab.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}} Moving goods by modern rail lines was both cheaper and quicker, and hundreds of Mirpuri boatmen found themselves out of a job.\n\nAt the same time long-distance ocean trade was shifting from sail to steam. There was a huge demand for men who were prepared to work in the hot, dirty and dangerous stokeholds of the new coal-fired steamers. British seamen avoided such jobs whenever they possibly could.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}} They preferred to work on deck. But in the 1870s Mirpuri ex-river boatmen  were desperately searching for a new source of income.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}} Although unfamiliar with stoking coal-fired boilers, they were prepared to learn and quickly gained jobs as engine-room stokers on new steamships sailing out of Karachi and Bombay, a position they retained until coal-fired ships were finally phased out of service at the end of the Second World War. Many Mirpuris also fought in the Indian Army in Burma during the Second World War.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\n===Postwar===\nAfter World War II, a new set of opportunities opened up. Britain's economy was just starting what proved to be a long postwar boom, and there was an acute short of labour in the foundries of the [[English Midlands]] and in the textile mills of [[Yorkshire]] and [[Lancashire]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}} Now it was the turn of ex-seamen to become industrial workers in Britain.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}} In 1960, when the Mangla Dam was about to be constructed, those who were going to be deprived of their agricultural land were afforded the opportunity to migrate to the United Kingdom and to join their relatives, who long established themselves in Britain.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\nAlthough one major reason for the outflow was the construction of the [[Mangla Dam]], but long before the construction of dam, a sizable Mirpuri community already existed in the UK.\n\n==Mirpur City ==\n\nMirpur City is at 459 m above sea level and is linked with the main [[Peshawar]]-[[Lahore]] Grand Trunk Road at [[Dina (town)|Dina Tehsil]]. It is the headquarters of Mirpur District, which has two subdivisions: Mirpur and Dadyal. Mirpur is now one of the largest city of Azad Kashmir.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20091027084826/http://www.geocities.com/sam4mobile/Dadyal-Thumbnail-view.html Internet Archive Wayback Machine]. Web.archive.org (2009-10-27). Retrieved on 2011-12-17.</ref> The building of the new city in late 1960s paved the way for New Mirpur, situated on the bank of [[Mangla]] Lake. The project of four-star hotel PC has been completed. The government is planning to make the second rotating hotel of Pakistan in Mirpur, Azad Kashmir.\n\nIn fact, the remains of the old city (Old Mirpur) are under the waters of the Mangla Lake, bit during the colder months of March and April, the water level recedes to such an extent that one can travel on motorcycle on the old Mirpur, road which still exists. The holy shrines of Syed Abdul Karim and Meeran Shah Ghazi then become visible and so do the remnants of a Sikh [[gurdwara]] as well as a Hindu [[Hindu temple|Mandir]], possibly dedicated to the \"Mangla Mata\" (Mangla mother goddess). The remains of old houses, water wells and graveyards reappear as well.\n\nPeople from surrounding areas visit old Mirpur to pay homage to their ancient land on which they lived and pray on the graveyards of their loved ones. Urs Mubarak of Meeran Shah and Syed Abdul Kareem are also arranged in Old Mirpur.\n\nThe remains of Old Mirpur depict a silhouette of pre-[[Partition of India|Independence]] city, when many faiths coexisted. However, after division of the State of Jammu Kashmir, the non-Muslim community (Hindus, Buddhists and Sikhs) fled to Jammu.\n\nNew Mirpur was well planned, and modern buildings and ample roads serve each part of city. The affluence from emigration mainly to the UK is reflected by the structure and grandiose of the residential houses. There are telltale signs of inward investment by the expatriate community living in the United Kingdom, Europe, North America and the [[Middle East]]. There are a number of good hotels, restaurants, shopping malls and other urban facilities.\n\n==Agriculture==\nMost of the area's bushy landscapes, stretching from Bhimber to Dadyal, are barren, leaving only a small stretch of fertile land but there is highly-productive land near water. One crop cultivated during the spring/summer season is millet. Also, a few farms grow vegetables and wheat, especially when the dam water subsides during the winter season.\n\n==Industry==\nThe government of Azad Jammu and Kashmir has successfully developed Mirpur industrially and promoted private investment in a diverse economy: [[foam]], polypropylene, synthetic yarn, motorbikes and scooter, textile, vegetable oil (ghee), wood and sawmills, soap, [[cosmetics]], [[marble]], ready-made garments, matches and rosin, [[turpentine]]. The economy of Mirpur generated economy of Azad Kashmir. However, much of the infrastructure still needs improvement so that high-quality products can be obtained.\n\nAs part of the relief/compensation package in the wake of Mangla Dam, a new city is being developed along the southeastern outskirts of Mirpur, with the main city of Mirpur being doubled. Much construction is occurring around the whole district by Pakistani and Chinese contractors, raising the dam. Four towns in the district have been planned near the new city to resettle the population affected by the project.\n\n==Education ==\n[[English language|English]] is common in educational institutes.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}} Previously, the [[University of Azad Jammu & Kashmir]] was the only institution for higher studies but there have been significant changes in the educational infrastructure. The [[Mirpur University of Science and Technology]] (MUST), the [[Mirpur University of Science and Technology#Akson College of Health Sciences|Akson College of Health Science]] and the [[Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto Shaheed Medical College]] have been formed.\n\nThe [[AJK Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education, Mirpur]] is responsible for the studies at lower levels. In addition to the state-run schools and colleges, Mirpur has a well-developed private sector providing the education to all sections of the society:\n\nOther notable colleges and schools include:\n<!-- ONLY ADD A NAME TO THIS LIST IF IT ALREADY HAS A WIKIPEDIA ARTICLE-->\n* [[The City School (Pakistan)|The City School]]\n* [[Mohi ud Din Islamic Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences]]\n* [[Mohi-ud-Din Islamic Medical College]]\n* [[Punjab College]], Mirpur\n\n== Media ==\n{{expand section|date=February 2019}}\nElectronic and print media are rapidly increasing in number. There are many daily newspaper published in Mirpur.\n\n== Sport ==\n\nFootball, cricket and volleyball are popular in Mirpur. Mirpur has a cricket stadium, [[Quaid-e-Azam Stadium]].\n\nThere are registered sports clubs:A-5 Cricket Club, Al-Siraj Cricket Club, South Asia Cricket Club, Pilot Football Club, Youth Football Club and Kashmir National FC.\n\nThe district football team of Mirpur take part in the All [[Azad Jammu and Kashmir]] football championships.\n\n==Transport==\n[[CNG]] auto rickshaws are very  popular mode of transport for short routes within the city.

The bulk of the [[Mirpuri diaspora]] resides in England.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/6178092.stm|title=The limits to integration|last=Moss|first=Paul|date=30 November 2006|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=1 May 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Hindu and Sikh communities===\n{{Main|1947 Mirpur Massacre}}\nBefore the [[First Kashmir War|Kashmir War]] in 1947, the [[Mirpur District]] had about 75,000 Hindu and Sikhs, amounting to 20 percent of the population.{{sfn|Snedden, Unwritten History|2013|p=28}} A great majority of them lived in the principal towns of Mirpur, [[Kotli]] and [[Bhimber]]. Refugees from Jhelum in Western Punjab had taken refuge in Mirpur town, causing the non-Muslim population to increase to 25,000. On 25 November 1947, tribesmen and Pakistani military members moved into the town, seizing the city. Of the minority population, only about 2,500 Hindus or Sikhs escaped to the Jammu and Kashmir along with the State troops. The remainder were marched to Alibeg, where a gurdwara was converted into a prison camp, but the raiders killed 10,000 of the captives along the way and abducted 5,000 women. Only about 5,000 made it to Alibeg, but they continued to be killed at a gradual pace by the captors. In March 1948, the [[ICRC]] rescued 1,600 of the survivors from Alibeg, who were resettled to [[Jammu]] and other areas of India. The date of 25 November is remembered as the ''Mirpur Day'' in the Indian-administered Kashmir.{{sfn|Snedden, Unwritten History|2013|p=56}}{{sfn|Puri, Across the Line of Control|2013|p=30}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.khalidhasan.net/2007/03/16/mirpur-1947-%E2%80%93-the-untold-story/|title=Mirpur 1947 \u2013 the untold story|last=Hassan|first=Khalid|date=16 March 2007|publisher=Khalid Hasan Online|accessdate=2015-08-13|url-status=unfit|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928132633/http://www.khalidhasan.net/2007/03/16/mirpur-1947-%E2%80%93-the-untold-story/|archivedate=September 28, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://udayindia.org/content_08may2010/statescan.html |last=Gupta |first=Prakriiti |title=Horrific Tales: Over 3,00,000 Hindus, Sikhs from PoK still fighting for their acceptance |newspaper=Uday India |date=8 May 2010 |accessdate=2015-08-13 |url-status=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110908063433/http://udayindia.org/content_08may2010/statescan.html |archivedate=September 8, 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{citation |first=Raj Kumar |last=Bhagotra |chapter=Escape from death seven times |editor=Bal K.
