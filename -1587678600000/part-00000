Areas not on the Atlantic coast experience warmer summers more typical of inland areas, and winter lows are a little colder.\n\nDescribed on the provincial vehicle licence plate as Canada's Ocean Playground, Nova Scotia is surrounded by four major bodies of water: the [[Gulf of Saint Lawrence]] to the north, the [[Bay of Fundy]] to the west, the [[Gulf of Maine]] to the southwest, and the Atlantic Ocean to the east.<ref name=\"ECclimate\" />\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"margin:auto;\"\n|+Average daily maximum and minimum temperatures for selected locations in Nova Scotia<ref name=\"Canadian Climate Normals 1981-2010\">{{cite web|url=http://climate.weather.gc.ca/climate_normals/index_e.html|title=Canadian Climate Normals|publisher=Environment and Climate Change Canada|date=11 June 2019}}</ref>\n|-\n!Location\n!July (\u00b0C)\n!July (\u00b0F)\n!January (\u00b0C)\n!January (\u00b0F)\n|-\n|[[Halifax, Nova Scotia|Halifax]] || 23/14 || 73/58 || 0/\u22128 || 32/17\n|-\n|[[Sydney, Nova Scotia|Sydney]] || 23/12 || 73/54 || \u22121/\u22129 || 30/14\n|-\n|[[Kentville, Nova Scotia|Kentville]] || 25/14 || 78/57 || \u22121/\u221210 || 29/14\n|-\n|[[Truro, Nova Scotia|Truro]] || 24/13 || 75/55 || \u22121/\u221212 || 29/9\n|-\n|[[Liverpool, Nova Scotia|Liverpool]] || 25/14 || 77/57 || 0/\u20139 || 32/15\n|-\n|[[Shelburne, Nova Scotia|Shelburne]] || 23/12 || 73/54 || 1/\u22128 || 33/17\n|-\n|[[Yarmouth, Nova Scotia|Yarmouth]] || 21/12 || 69/55 || 1/\u22127 || 33/19\n|}<!-- Do not add data that conflicts with the source -->\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|History of Nova Scotia}}\n{{See also|Military history of Nova Scotia}}\n[[File:Mi'kmaq people at Tufts Cove, Nova Scotia, Canada, ca. 1871.jpg|thumb|[[Mi'kmaq]] family in [[Tuft's Cove, Nova Scotia|Tuft's Cove]], 1871.

The British [[Siege of Port Royal (1710)|siege of Port Royal]] took place in 1710, ending French-rule in peninsular Acadia. The subsequent signing of the [[Treaty of Utrecht]] in 1713 formally recognized this, although saw the returned [[Cape Breton Island]] (''{{lang|fr|\u00cele Royale}}'') to the French. Despite the British [[Siege of Port Royal (1710)|conquest of Acadia]] in 1710, Nova Scotia remained primarily occupied by Catholic Acadians and Mi'kmaq, who confined British forces to Annapolis and to Canso. Present-day New Brunswick then still formed a part of the French colony of Acadia. Immediately after the capture of Port Royal in 1710, [[Francis Nicholson]] announced it would be renamed [[Annapolis Royal]] in honor of [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]].\n\nAs a result of [[Father Rale's War]] (1722\u20131725), the Mi'kmaq signed a series of treaties with Great Britain in 1725.

The 75-year period of war ended with the [[Halifax Treaties]] between the British and the Mi'kmaq (1761). After the war, some Acadians were allowed to return and the British made treaties with the Mi\u2019kmaq.\n\nIn 1763, most of Acadia (Cape Breton Island, St. John's Island (now [[Prince Edward Island]]), and New Brunswick) became part of Nova Scotia. In 1765, the county of [[Sunbury County, Nova Scotia|Sunbury]] was created. This included the territory of present-day [[New Brunswick]] and eastern [[Maine]] as far as the [[Penobscot River]]. In 1769, St. John's Island became a separate colony.\n\nThe [[American Revolution]] (1775\u20131783) had a significant impact on shaping Nova Scotia. Initially, Nova Scotia\u2014\"the 14th American Colony\" as some called it\u2014displayed ambivalence over whether the colony should join the more southern colonies in their defiance of Britain, and rebellion flared at the [[Battle of Fort Cumberland]] (1776) and at the [[Siege of Saint John (1777)]]. Throughout the war, American [[privateers]] devastated the maritime economy by capturing ships and looting almost every community outside of Halifax. These American raids alienated many sympathetic or neutral Nova Scotians into supporting the British. By the end of the war Nova Scotia had outfitted a number of privateers to attack American shipping.<ref>Roger Marsters (2004). ''Bold Privateers: Terror, Plunder and Profit on Canada's Atlantic Coast'', pp. 87\u201389.</ref> British military forces based at Halifax succeeded in preventing American support for rebels in Nova Scotia and deterred any invasion of Nova Scotia. However the British navy failed to establish naval supremacy. While the British captured many American privateers in battles such as the [[Naval battle off Halifax]] (1782), many more continued attacks on shipping and settlements until the final months of the war. The Royal Navy struggled to maintain British supply lines, defending convoys from American and French attacks as in the fiercely fought convoy battle, the [[Naval battle off Cape Breton]] (1781).\n[[File:AricanNovaScotianByCaptain William Booth1788.png|thumb|A [[Black Loyalist]] wood cutter, at [[Shelburne, Nova Scotia]], in 1788]]\nAfter the Thirteen Colonies and their French allies forced the British forces to surrender (1781), approximately 33,000 [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalists]] (the King's Loyal Americans, allowed to place \"[[United Empire Loyalist]]\" after their names) settled in Nova Scotia (14,000 of them in what became New Brunswick) on lands granted by the Crown as some compensation for their losses. (The British administration divided Nova Scotia and hived off Cape Breton and [[New Brunswick]] in 1784). The Loyalist exodus created new communities across Nova Scotia, including [[Shelburne, Nova Scotia|Shelburne]], which briefly became one of the larger British settlements in North America, and infused Nova Scotia with additional capital and skills. There are also a number of Black loyalists buried in unmarked graves in the [[Old Burying Ground (Halifax, Nova Scotia)]].\n\nHowever the migration also caused political tensions between Loyalist leaders and the leaders of the existing [[New England Planters]] settlement. The Loyalist influx also pushed Nova Scotia's 2000 Mi'kmaq People to the margins as Loyalist land grants encroached on ill-defined native lands. As part of the Loyalist migration, about 3,000 [[Black Loyalist]]s arrived; they founded the largest free Black settlement in North America at [[Birchtown, Nova Scotia|Birchtown]], near Shelburne. Many Nova Scotian communities were [[Nova Scotia in the American Revolution#Loyalist settlements|settled by British regiments that fought in the war]].\n\n====19th century====\n[[File:John Christian Schetky, H.M.S.

The [[Nova Scotia peninsula|peninsula]] that makes up Nova Scotia's mainland is connected to the rest of North America by the [[Isthmus of Chignecto]], on which the province's land border with [[New Brunswick]] is located. The province borders the [[Bay of Fundy]] to the northwest and the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to the south and east, and is separated from Prince Edward Island and the island of [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] by the [[Northumberland Strait|Northumberland]] and [[Cabot Strait|Cabot]] straits, respectively.\n\nThe land that comprises what is now Nova Scotia has been inhabited by the indigenous [[Mi\ua78ckmaq]] people for thousands of years. [[France]]'s first settlement in North America, {{nobreak|[[Port-Royal National Historic Site|Port-Royal]]}}, was established in 1605 and intermittently served in various locations as the capital of the French colony of [[Acadia]] for over a hundred years. The [[Fortress of Louisbourg]] was a key focus point in the struggle between the British and French for control of the area, changing hands numerous times until France relinquished its claims with the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1763. During the [[American Revolutionary War]], thousands of [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalists]] settled in Nova Scotia. In 1848, Nova Scotia became the first British colony to achieve [[responsible government]], and it [[Canadian Confederation|federated]] in July 1867 with New Brunswick and the [[Province of Canada]] (now [[Ontario]] and [[Quebec]]) to form what is now the country of Canada.\n\nNova Scotia's [[Capital city|capital]] and largest city is [[Halifax, Nova Scotia|Halifax]], which today is home to about 45 per cent of the province's population, is the [[List of census metropolitan areas and agglomerations in Canada|thirteenth-largest]] census metropolitan area in Canada,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/nova-scotia|title=Nova Scotia {{!}} The Canadian Encyclopedia|website=www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca|access-date=2020-03-04}}</ref> the largest city in Atlantic Canada, and Canada's second-largest coastal city (after [[Vancouver]]).\n\n== Etymology ==\n{{Further|Etymology of Scotland}}\n\"Nova Scotia\" means \"New [[Scotland]]\" in [[Latin]]<ref>[http://www.novascotia.com/en/home/discovernovascotia/history/routestoyourroots/settlementpatterns/scottishsettlement.aspx Scottish Settlement] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131207152640/http://www.novascotia.com/en/home/discovernovascotia/history/routestoyourroots/settlementpatterns/scottishsettlement.aspx |date=7 December 2013 }}.

The British [[Siege of Port Royal (1710)|siege of Port Royal]] took place in 1710, ending French-rule in peninsular Acadia. The subsequent signing of the [[Treaty of Utrecht]] in 1713 formally recognized this, although saw the returned [[Cape Breton Island]] (''{{lang|fr|\u00cele Royale}}'') to the French. Despite the British [[Siege of Port Royal (1710)|conquest of Acadia]] in 1710, Nova Scotia remained primarily occupied by Catholic Acadians and Mi'kmaq, who confined British forces to Annapolis and to Canso. Present-day New Brunswick then still formed a part of the French colony of Acadia. Immediately after the capture of Port Royal in 1710, [[Francis Nicholson]] announced it would be renamed [[Annapolis Royal]] in honor of [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]].\n\nAs a result of [[Father Rale's War]] (1722\u20131725), the Mi'kmaq signed a series of treaties with Great Britain in 1725. The British signed a treaty (or \"agreement\") with the Mi'kmaq, but the authorities{{which|date=June 2016}} have often disputed its definition of the rights of the Mi'kmaq to hunt and fish on their lands.<ref>{{cite web |title=Mascarene's Treaty of 1725 |url=http://www.stmarysfirstnation.com/consult/Treaty1.pdf}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Mascarene 'sTreaty of 1725 |url=https://www.apcfnc.ca/images/uploads/mascarenestreaty.pdf}}</ref> However, conflict between the Acadians, Mi'kmaq, French, and the British persisted in the following decades with [[King George's War]] (1744\u20131748). \n[[File:Deportation Grand-Pr\u00e9.jpg|thumb|[[Expulsion of the Acadians]] in [[Grand-Pr\u00e9, Nova Scotia|Grand-Pr\u00e9]].

The 75-year period of war ended with the [[Halifax Treaties]] between the British and the Mi'kmaq (1761). After the war, some Acadians were allowed to return and the British made treaties with the Mi\u2019kmaq.\n\nIn 1763, most of Acadia (Cape Breton Island, St. John's Island (now [[Prince Edward Island]]), and New Brunswick) became part of Nova Scotia. In 1765, the county of [[Sunbury County, Nova Scotia|Sunbury]] was created. This included the territory of present-day [[New Brunswick]] and eastern [[Maine]] as far as the [[Penobscot River]]. In 1769, St. John's Island became a separate colony.\n\nThe [[American Revolution]] (1775\u20131783) had a significant impact on shaping Nova Scotia. Initially, Nova Scotia\u2014\"the 14th American Colony\" as some called it\u2014displayed ambivalence over whether the colony should join the more southern colonies in their defiance of Britain, and rebellion flared at the [[Battle of Fort Cumberland]] (1776) and at the [[Siege of Saint John (1777)]]. Throughout the war, American [[privateers]] devastated the maritime economy by capturing ships and looting almost every community outside of Halifax. These American raids alienated many sympathetic or neutral Nova Scotians into supporting the British. By the end of the war Nova Scotia had outfitted a number of privateers to attack American shipping.<ref>Roger Marsters (2004). ''Bold Privateers: Terror, Plunder and Profit on Canada's Atlantic Coast'', pp. 87\u201389.</ref> British military forces based at Halifax succeeded in preventing American support for rebels in Nova Scotia and deterred any invasion of Nova Scotia. However the British navy failed to establish naval supremacy. While the British captured many American privateers in battles such as the [[Naval battle off Halifax]] (1782), many more continued attacks on shipping and settlements until the final months of the war. The Royal Navy struggled to maintain British supply lines, defending convoys from American and French attacks as in the fiercely fought convoy battle, the [[Naval battle off Cape Breton]] (1781).\n[[File:AricanNovaScotianByCaptain William Booth1788.png|thumb|A [[Black Loyalist]] wood cutter, at [[Shelburne, Nova Scotia]], in 1788]]\nAfter the Thirteen Colonies and their French allies forced the British forces to surrender (1781), approximately 33,000 [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalists]] (the King's Loyal Americans, allowed to place \"[[United Empire Loyalist]]\" after their names) settled in Nova Scotia (14,000 of them in what became New Brunswick) on lands granted by the Crown as some compensation for their losses. (The British administration divided Nova Scotia and hived off Cape Breton and [[New Brunswick]] in 1784). The Loyalist exodus created new communities across Nova Scotia, including [[Shelburne, Nova Scotia|Shelburne]], which briefly became one of the larger British settlements in North America, and infused Nova Scotia with additional capital and skills. There are also a number of Black loyalists buried in unmarked graves in the [[Old Burying Ground (Halifax, Nova Scotia)]].\n\nHowever the migration also caused political tensions between Loyalist leaders and the leaders of the existing [[New England Planters]] settlement. The Loyalist influx also pushed Nova Scotia's 2000 Mi'kmaq People to the margins as Loyalist land grants encroached on ill-defined native lands. As part of the Loyalist migration, about 3,000 [[Black Loyalist]]s arrived; they founded the largest free Black settlement in North America at [[Birchtown, Nova Scotia|Birchtown]], near Shelburne. Many Nova Scotian communities were [[Nova Scotia in the American Revolution#Loyalist settlements|settled by British regiments that fought in the war]].\n\n====19th century====\n[[File:John Christian Schetky, H.M.S.

The [[Anti-Confederation Party]] was led by [[Joseph Howe]]. Almost three months later, in the election of 18 September 1867, the Anti-Confederation Party won 18 out of 19 federal seats, and 36 out of 38 seats in the provincial legislature.\n\nThroughout the 19th century, numerous businesses developed in Nova Scotia became of pan-Canadian and international importance: the [[Starr Manufacturing Company]] (first skate-manufacturer in Canada), the [[Bank of Nova Scotia]], [[Cunard Line]], [[Alexander Keith's Brewery]], [[Morse's Tea Company]] (first tea company in Canada), among others. \n[[File:Bluenose sailing 1921.jpg|thumb|The ''[[Bluenose]]'' in 1921.

Nova Scotia produced internationally recognized shipbuilders [[Donald McKay]] and [[William Dawson Lawrence]]. The fame Nova Scotia achieved from sailors was assured when [[Joshua Slocum]] became the first man to sail single-handedly around the world (1895). International attention continued into the following century with the many racing victories of the ''[[Bluenose]]'' schooner.

Burnett was then a regular on ''[[The Garry Moore Show]]'' and Andrews had appeared as a guest twice, performing the song \"[[Big D (song)|Big D]]\" from the musical ''[[The Most Happy Fella]]'' in the first appearance; and in the show's 1961 Christmas special, she did a number with Burnett and fellow guest [[Gwen Verdon]] plus an early performance of \"[[My Favorite Things (song)|My Favorite Things]]\" (three years before she performed it as Maria while filming ''[[The Sound of Music (film)|The Sound of Music]]'').\n\nBurnett tells an anecdote about the development of the special. CBS programming executives [[Michael Dann]] and Oscar Katz were reluctant to approve it. They believed Andrews did not have sufficient name recognition and with Burnett appearing weekly on Moore's show the public would not tune in. Following a CBS promotional event, Burnett was unable to hail a taxi. Dann and Katz offered to wait until one appeared but Burnett said not to bother, that a truck driver would appear shortly and offer her a ride. Almost instantly a trucker appeared and offered Burnett a ride. Burnett received a telephone call from Katz immediately upon arriving home.

Burnett was then a regular on ''[[The Garry Moore Show]]'' and Andrews had appeared as a guest twice, performing the song \"[[Big D (song)|Big D]]\" from the musical ''[[The Most Happy Fella]]'' in the first appearance; and in the show's 1961 Christmas special, she did a number with Burnett and fellow guest [[Gwen Verdon]] plus an early performance of \"[[My Favorite Things (song)|My Favorite Things]]\" (three years before she performed it as Maria while filming ''[[The Sound of Music (film)|The Sound of Music]]'').\n\nBurnett tells an anecdote about the development of the special. CBS programming executives [[Michael Dann]] and Oscar Katz were reluctant to approve it. They believed Andrews did not have sufficient name recognition and with Burnett appearing weekly on Moore's show the public would not tune in. Following a CBS promotional event, Burnett was unable to hail a taxi. Dann and Katz offered to wait until one appeared but Burnett said not to bother, that a truck driver would appear shortly and offer her a ride. Almost instantly a trucker appeared and offered Burnett a ride. Burnett received a telephone call from Katz immediately upon arriving home. Taking the trucker incident as a sign, he approved the special.<ref>Burnett, pp. 195\u2014201</ref>\n\n[[Mike Nichols]] wrote the script and co-wrote the song \"You're So London\" with Ken Welch.<ref name = song>{{Cite news\n  | title = Carol Burnett Introduces Song\n  | newspaper = Cape Girardeau Southeast Missourian\n  | page = 3B\n  | date = 1962-06-08 }}</ref> Writing began in February 1962 and the stars rehearsed for two weeks before the March 5 taping.<ref name = first>{{cite news\n  | last = Lowry\n  | first = Cynthia\n  | title = First nighter is a one nighter\n  | newspaper = The Milwaukee Journal\n  | page = 6\n  | agency = Associated Press\n  | date = 1962-03-18 }}</ref> [[Irwin Kostal]] was the musical director.
