However, these methods do not perform well when applied to very high-dimensional systems.\n\nParticle filters update their prediction in an approximate (statistical) manner. The samples from the distribution are represented by a set of particles; each particle has a likelihood weight assigned to it that represents the probability of that particle being sampled from the probability density function. Weight disparity leading to weight collapse is a common issue encountered in these filtering algorithms; however it can be mitigated by including a resampling step before the weights become too uneven. Several adaptive resampling criteria can be used, including the variance of the weights and the relative entropy with respect to the uniform distribution.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite journal|last1 = Del Moral|first1 = Pierre|last2 = Doucet|first2 = Arnaud|last3 = Jasra|first3 = Ajay|title = On Adaptive Resampling Procedures for Sequential Monte Carlo Methods|journal = Bernoulli|date = 2012|volume = 18|issue = 1|pages = 252\u2013278|url = http://hal.inria.fr/docs/00/33/25/83/PDF/RR-6700.pdf|doi = 10.3150/10-bej335}}</ref> In the resampling step, the particles with negligible weights are replaced by new particles in the proximity of the particles with higher weights.\n\nFrom the statistical and probabilistic point of view, particle filters can be interpreted as [[Mean field particle methods|mean field particle]] interpretations of [[Feynman\u2013Kac formula|Feynman-Kac]] probability measures.<ref name=\"dp042\">{{cite book|last = Del Moral|first = Pierre|title = Feynman-Kac formulae.

The particle filter is designed for a [[hidden Markov Model]], where the system consists of both hidden and observable variables. The observable variables (observation process) are related to the hidden variables (state-process) by some functional form that is known. Similarly the dynamical system describing the evolution of the state variables is also known probabilistically.\n\nA generic particle filter estimates the posterior distribution of the hidden states using the observation measurement process. Consider a state-space shown in the diagram below.\n\n:<math>\\begin{array}{cccccccccc}\nX_0&\\to &X_1&\\to &X_2&\\to&X_3&\\to &\\cdots&\\text{signal}\\\\\n\\downarrow&&\\downarrow&&\\downarrow&&\\downarrow&&\\cdots&\\\\\nY_0&&Y_1&&Y_2&&Y_3&&\\cdots&\\text{observation}\n\\end{array}</math>\n \nThe filtering problem is to estimate '''sequentially''' the values of the hidden states <math>X_k</math>, given the values of the observation process <math>Y_0,\\cdots,Y_k,</math> at any time step ''k''.\n\nAll Bayesian estimates of <math>X_k</math> follow from the [[Posterior probability|posterior density]]  ''p''(''x''<sub>''k''</sub>&nbsp;|&nbsp;''y''<sub>0</sub>,''y''<sub>1</sub>,\u2026,''y''<sub>''k''</sub>). The particle filter methodology provides an approximation of these conditional probabilities using the empirical measure associated with a genetic type particle algorithm.  In contrast, the [[Markov chain Monte Carlo|MCMC]] or [[importance sampling]] approach would model the full posterior ''p''(''x''<sub>0</sub>,''x''<sub>1</sub>,\u2026,''x''<sub>''k''</sub>&nbsp;|&nbsp;''y''<sub>0</sub>,''y''<sub>1</sub>,\u2026,''y''<sub>''k''</sub>).\n\n===The Signal-Observation Model===\nParticle methods often assume <math>X_k</math> and the observations <math>Y_k</math> can be modeled in this form:\n\n*<math>X_0, X_1, \\cdots</math> is a [[Markov process]] on <math>\\mathbb R^{d_x}</math> (for some <math>d_x\\geqslant 1</math>) that evolves according to the transition probability density <math>p(x_k|x_{k-1})</math>. This model is also often written in a synthetic way as \n*:<math>X_k|X_{k-1}=x_k \\sim p(x_k|x_{k-1})</math>\n:with an initial probability density <math>p(x_0)</math>.\n*The observations <math>Y_0, Y_1, \\cdots</math>  take values in some state space on <math>\\mathbb{R}^{d_y}</math> (for some <math>d_y\\geqslant 1</math>) and are conditionally independent provided that <math>X_0, X_1, \\cdots</math> are known. In other words, each <math>Y_k</math> only depends on <math>X_k</math>. In addition, we assume conditional distribution for <math>Y_k</math> given <math>X_k=x_k</math> are absolutely continuous, and in a synthetic way we have\n*:<math>Y_k|X_k=y_k \\sim p(y_k|x_k)</math>\nAn example of system with these properties is:\n\n:<math>X_k = g(X_{k-1}) + W_{k-1}</math>\n:<math>Y_k = h(X_k) + V_k</math>\n\nwhere both <math>W_k</math> and <math>V_k</math> are mutually independent sequences with known [[probability density function]]s and ''g'' and ''h'' are known functions. These two equations can be viewed as [[state space (controls)|state space]] equations and look similar to the state space equations for the Kalman filter. If the functions ''g'' and ''h'' in the above example are linear, and if both <math>W_k</math> and <math>V_k</math> are [[Gaussian]], the Kalman filter finds the exact Bayesian filtering distribution.  If not, Kalman filter based methods are a first-order approximation ([[Extended Kalman filter|EKF]]) or a second-order approximation (UKF in general, but if probability distribution is Gaussian a third-order approximation is possible).\n\nThe assumption that the initial distribution and the transitions of the Markov chain are absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure can be relaxed. To design a particle filter we simply need to assume that we can sample the transitions <math>X_{k-1} \\to X_k</math> of the Markov chain <math>X_k,</math> and to compute the likelihood function <math>x_k\\mapsto p(y_k|x_k)</math> (see for instance the genetic selection mutation description of the particle filter given below). The absolutely continuous assumption on the Markov transitions of <math>X_k</math> are only used to derive in an informal (and rather abusive) way different formulae between posterior distributions using the Bayes' rule for conditional densities.\n\n=== [[Approximate Bayesian computation|Approximate Bayesian Computation models]] ===\nIn some problems, the conditional distribution of the observations given the random states of the signal may fail to have a density or may be impossible or too complex to compute.<ref name=\":PFOBC\"/> In this situation, we need to resort to an additional level of approximation. One strategy is to replace the signal <math>X_k</math> by the Markov chain <math>\\mathcal X_k=\\left(X_k,Y_k\\right)</math> and to introduce a virtual observation of the form\n\n:<math>\\mathcal Y_k=Y_k+\\epsilon \\mathcal V_k\\quad\\mbox{for some parameter}\\quad\\epsilon\\in [0,1]</math>\n\nfor some sequence of independent sequences with known [[probability density function]]s. The central idea is to observe that\n\n:<math>\\text{Law}\\left(X_k|\\mathcal Y_0=y_0,\\cdots, \\mathcal Y_k=y_k\\right)\\approx_{\\epsilon\\downarrow 0} \\text{Law}\\left(X_k|Y_0=y_0,\\cdots, Y_k=y_k\\right)</math>\n\nThe particle filter associated with the Markov process <math>\\mathcal X_k=\\left(X_k,Y_k\\right)</math> given the partial observations <math>\\mathcal Y_0=y_0,\\cdots, \\mathcal Y_k=y_k,</math> is defined in terms of particles evolving in <math>\\mathbb R^{d_x+d_y}</math> with a likelihood function given with some obvious abusive notation by <math>p(\\mathcal Y_k|\\mathcal X_k)</math>. These probabilistic techniques are closely related to [[Approximate Bayesian Computation]] (ABC). In the context of particle filters, these ABC particle filtering techniques were introduced in 1998 by P. Del Moral, J. Jacod and P.

From the probabilistic point of view they coincide with a [[Mean field particle methods|mean field particle]] interpretation of the nonlinear filtering equation. The updating-prediction transitions of the optimal filter evolution can also be interpreted as the classical genetic type selection-mutation transitions of individuals. The sequential importance resampling technique provides another interpretation of the filtering transitions coupling importance sampling with the bootstrap resampling step.

This requires that a Markov equation can be written (and computed) to generate a <math>x_k</math> based only upon <math>x_{k-1}</math>. This algorithm uses composition of the P particles from <math>k-1</math> to generate a particle at ''k'' and repeats (steps 2\u20136) until P particles are generated at ''k''.\n\nThis can be more easily visualized if ''x'' is viewed as a two-dimensional array. One dimension is ''k'' and the other dimensions is the particle number. For example, <math>x(k,i)</math> would be the i<sup>th</sup> particle at <math>k</math> and can also be written <math>x_k^{(i)}</math> (as done above in the algorithm). Step 3 generates a ''potential'' <math>x_k</math> based on a randomly chosen particle (<math>x_{k-1}^{(i)}</math>) at time <math>k-1</math> and rejects or accepts it in step 6. In other words, the <math>x_k</math> values are generated using the previously generated <math>x_{k-1}</math>.\n\n==Other particle filters==\n* [[Exponential Natural Particle Filter]]<ref name=\"xnpf2015\">{{cite arXiv\n | author = Zand, G.\n | author2= Taherkhani, M. |author3=Safabakhsh, R. \n | year = 2015\n | title = Exponential Natural Particle Filter\n | eprint = 1511.06603\n| class= cs.LG }}</ref>\n* [[Auxiliary particle filter]]<ref name=\"apf1999\">{{cite journal\n | author = Pitt, M.K.\n |author2=Shephard, N.\n | year = 1999\n | title = Filtering Via Simulation: Auxiliary Particle Filters\n | journal = Journal of the American Statistical Association\n | volume = 94\n | issue = 446\n | pages = 590\u2013591\n | url = https://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&se=gglsc&d=5002321997 \n | accessdate = 2008-05-06\n | doi = 10.2307/2670179\n | jstor = 2670179\n }}</ref>\n* [[Regularized auxiliary particle filter]]<ref name=\"jliu2011\">{{cite journal\n | author = Liu, J.\n |author2=Wang, W. |author3=Ma, F. \n | year = 2011\n | title = A Regularized Auxiliary Particle Filtering Approach for System State Estimation and Battery Life Prediction\n | journal = Smart Materials and Structures\n | volume = 20\n | issue = 7\n | pages = 1\u20139\n | doi = 10.1088/0964-1726/20/7/075021\n| bibcode = 2011SMaS...20g5021L}}</ref>\n* Gaussian particle filter\n* Unscented particle filter\n* Gauss\u2013Hermite particle filter\n* Cost Reference particle filter\n* Hierarchical/Scalable particle filter<ref name=\"Canton2011\">{{cite journal\n | author = Canton-Ferrer, C.\n |author2=Casas, J.R. |author3=Pard\u00e0s, M. \n | year = 2011\n | title = Human Motion Capture Using Scalable Body Models\n | journal = Computer Vision and Image Understanding\n | volume = 115\n | issue = 10\n | pages = 1363\u20131374\n | doi = 10.1016/j.cviu.2011.06.001\n |hdl=2117/13393 }}</ref>\n* Rao\u2013Blackwellized particle filter<ref name=\"rbpf1999\"/>\n* [[Rejection sampling|Rejection-sampling]] based optimal particle filter<ref name=\"optrj2008\">{{cite conference\n| citeseerx           = 10.1.1.190.7092\n| title         = An Optimal Filtering Algorithm for Non-Parametric Observation Models in Robot Localization\n| author        = Blanco, J.L. |author2=Gonzalez, J. |author3=Fernandez-Madrigal, J.A.\n| year          = 2008\n| conference    = IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA'08)\n| pages         = 461\u2013466\n}}\n</ref><ref name=\"optrj2010\">{{cite journal\n| title         = Optimal Filtering for Non-Parametric Observation Models: Applications to Localization and SLAM\n| author        = Blanco, J.L. |author2=Gonzalez, J. |author3=Fernandez-Madrigal, J.A.\n| year          = 2010\n| journal       = The International Journal of Robotics Research (IJRR)\n| volume        = 29\n| number        = 14\n| pages         = 1726\u20131742\n| doi           = 10.1177/0278364910364165\n| citeseerx         = 10.1.1.1031.4931\n}}\n</ref>\n* Feynman-Kac and mean field particle methodologies<ref name=\"dm962\"/><ref name=\"dp13\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n* Particle Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo, see e.g. [[Pseudo-Marginal Metropolis-Hastings algorithm]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Mean field particle methods]]\n* [[Genetic algorithm]]\n* [[Ensemble Kalman filter]]\n* [[Generalized filtering]]\n* [[Moving horizon estimation]]\n* [[Recursive Bayesian estimation]]\n* [[Monte Carlo localization]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n* {{cite journal | last1 = Del Moral | first1 = Pierre | year = 1996 | title = Non Linear Filtering: Interacting Particle Solution | url = http://web.maths.unsw.edu.au/~peterdel-moral/mprfs.pdf | journal = Markov Processes and Related Fields | volume = 2 | issue = 4| pages = 555\u2013580 }}\n* Del Moral, Pierre (2004).

Weight disparity leading to weight collapse is a common issue encountered in these filtering algorithms; however it can be mitigated by including a resampling step before the weights become too uneven.

The particle filter is designed for a [[hidden Markov Model]], where the system consists of both hidden and observable variables. The observable variables (observation process) are related to the hidden variables (state-process) by some functional form that is known. Similarly the dynamical system describing the evolution of the state variables is also known probabilistically.\n\nA generic particle filter estimates the posterior distribution of the hidden states using the observation measurement process. Consider a state-space shown in the diagram below.\n\n:<math>\\begin{array}{cccccccccc}\nX_0&\\to &X_1&\\to &X_2&\\to&X_3&\\to &\\cdots&\\text{signal}\\\\\n\\downarrow&&\\downarrow&&\\downarrow&&\\downarrow&&\\cdots&\\\\\nY_0&&Y_1&&Y_2&&Y_3&&\\cdots&\\text{observation}\n\\end{array}</math>\n \nThe filtering problem is to estimate '''sequentially''' the values of the hidden states <math>X_k</math>, given the values of the observation process <math>Y_0,\\cdots,Y_k,</math> at any time step ''k''.\n\nAll Bayesian estimates of <math>X_k</math> follow from the [[Posterior probability|posterior density]]  ''p''(''x''<sub>''k''</sub>&nbsp;|&nbsp;''y''<sub>0</sub>,''y''<sub>1</sub>,\u2026,''y''<sub>''k''</sub>). The particle filter methodology provides an approximation of these conditional probabilities using the empirical measure associated with a genetic type particle algorithm.  In contrast, the [[Markov chain Monte Carlo|MCMC]] or [[importance sampling]] approach would model the full posterior ''p''(''x''<sub>0</sub>,''x''<sub>1</sub>,\u2026,''x''<sub>''k''</sub>&nbsp;|&nbsp;''y''<sub>0</sub>,''y''<sub>1</sub>,\u2026,''y''<sub>''k''</sub>).\n\n===The Signal-Observation Model===\nParticle methods often assume <math>X_k</math> and the observations <math>Y_k</math> can be modeled in this form:\n\n*<math>X_0, X_1, \\cdots</math> is a [[Markov process]] on <math>\\mathbb R^{d_x}</math> (for some <math>d_x\\geqslant 1</math>) that evolves according to the transition probability density <math>p(x_k|x_{k-1})</math>. This model is also often written in a synthetic way as \n*:<math>X_k|X_{k-1}=x_k \\sim p(x_k|x_{k-1})</math>\n:with an initial probability density <math>p(x_0)</math>.\n*The observations <math>Y_0, Y_1, \\cdots</math>  take values in some state space on <math>\\mathbb{R}^{d_y}</math> (for some <math>d_y\\geqslant 1</math>) and are conditionally independent provided that <math>X_0, X_1, \\cdots</math> are known. In other words, each <math>Y_k</math> only depends on <math>X_k</math>. In addition, we assume conditional distribution for <math>Y_k</math> given <math>X_k=x_k</math> are absolutely continuous, and in a synthetic way we have\n*:<math>Y_k|X_k=y_k \\sim p(y_k|x_k)</math>\nAn example of system with these properties is:\n\n:<math>X_k = g(X_{k-1}) + W_{k-1}</math>\n:<math>Y_k = h(X_k) + V_k</math>\n\nwhere both <math>W_k</math> and <math>V_k</math> are mutually independent sequences with known [[probability density function]]s and ''g'' and ''h'' are known functions. These two equations can be viewed as [[state space (controls)|state space]] equations and look similar to the state space equations for the Kalman filter. If the functions ''g'' and ''h'' in the above example are linear, and if both <math>W_k</math> and <math>V_k</math> are [[Gaussian]], the Kalman filter finds the exact Bayesian filtering distribution.  If not, Kalman filter based methods are a first-order approximation ([[Extended Kalman filter|EKF]]) or a second-order approximation (UKF in general, but if probability distribution is Gaussian a third-order approximation is possible).\n\nThe assumption that the initial distribution and the transitions of the Markov chain are absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure can be relaxed. To design a particle filter we simply need to assume that we can sample the transitions <math>X_{k-1} \\to X_k</math> of the Markov chain <math>X_k,</math> and to compute the likelihood function <math>x_k\\mapsto p(y_k|x_k)</math> (see for instance the genetic selection mutation description of the particle filter given below). The absolutely continuous assumption on the Markov transitions of <math>X_k</math> are only used to derive in an informal (and rather abusive) way different formulae between posterior distributions using the Bayes' rule for conditional densities.\n\n=== [[Approximate Bayesian computation|Approximate Bayesian Computation models]] ===\nIn some problems, the conditional distribution of the observations given the random states of the signal may fail to have a density or may be impossible or too complex to compute.<ref name=\":PFOBC\"/> In this situation, we need to resort to an additional level of approximation. One strategy is to replace the signal <math>X_k</math> by the Markov chain <math>\\mathcal X_k=\\left(X_k,Y_k\\right)</math> and to introduce a virtual observation of the form\n\n:<math>\\mathcal Y_k=Y_k+\\epsilon \\mathcal V_k\\quad\\mbox{for some parameter}\\quad\\epsilon\\in [0,1]</math>\n\nfor some sequence of independent sequences with known [[probability density function]]s. The central idea is to observe that\n\n:<math>\\text{Law}\\left(X_k|\\mathcal Y_0=y_0,\\cdots, \\mathcal Y_k=y_k\\right)\\approx_{\\epsilon\\downarrow 0} \\text{Law}\\left(X_k|Y_0=y_0,\\cdots, Y_k=y_k\\right)</math>\n\nThe particle filter associated with the Markov process <math>\\mathcal X_k=\\left(X_k,Y_k\\right)</math> given the partial observations <math>\\mathcal Y_0=y_0,\\cdots, \\mathcal Y_k=y_k,</math> is defined in terms of particles evolving in <math>\\mathbb R^{d_x+d_y}</math> with a likelihood function given with some obvious abusive notation by <math>p(\\mathcal Y_k|\\mathcal X_k)</math>.

From the probabilistic point of view they coincide with a [[Mean field particle methods|mean field particle]] interpretation of the nonlinear filtering equation. The updating-prediction transitions of the optimal filter evolution can also be interpreted as the classical genetic type selection-mutation transitions of individuals. The sequential importance resampling technique provides another interpretation of the filtering transitions coupling importance sampling with the bootstrap resampling step. Last, but not least, particle filters can be seen as an acceptance-rejection methodology equipped with a recycling mechanism.<ref name=\"dp13\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== [[Mean field particle methods|Mean field particle simulation]] ===\n{{Technical|section|date=June 2017}}\n\n==== The general probabilistic principle ====\nThe nonlinear filtering evolution can be interpreted as a dynamical system in the set of probability measures of the following form <math>\\eta_{n+1}=\\Phi_{n+1}\\left(\\eta_{n}\\right)</math> where <math>\\Phi_{n+1}</math> stands for some mapping from the set of probability distribution into itself.

In March and May 2008, Madoff International wire-transferred 135,000 pounds ($198,207) to buy a car for Peter Madoff, and delivered it to him  at his residence in [[Palm Beach, Florida|Palm Beach]]. Madoff International's listed assets are as much as $500 million and debt of more than $1 billion in its bankruptcy petition.  The bankruptcy is designed to block U.S. lawsuits against foreign companies with U.S. operations while they reorganize overseas.  Investors who filed an involuntary [[personal bankruptcy]] petition against Madoff want his business's U.K. unit's bankruptcy moved to New York because \"overlapping discovery, related assets and common creditors\" among the various cases mean they should be in the same court.\n\nThe Chapter 15 case is ''In re Madoff Securities International Ltd.'', 09-16751, [[U.S. Bankruptcy Court]], Southern District of Florida (West Palm Beach).<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601103&sid=agGTdJJDCZos&refer=us |title=Madoff Investors Want U.K. Unit Bankruptcy Moved (Update1) |publisher=Bloomberg.com |date=April 21, 2009 |accessdate=April 26, 2009 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090122224028/http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601103 |archivedate=January 22, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nOn June 8, 2009 the Chapter 15 case was transferred to the Southern District of New York as ''Madoff Securities International Limited, Stephen John Akers, Mark Richard Byers, and Andrew Laurence as the Joint Provisional Liquidators'', 09-12998, so it can be administered more effectively with the related involuntary bankruptcies against Madoff, and his companies, also filed in New York.

Friehling==\nSince at least 1991, Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities had been audited by Friehling & Horowitz CPAs, a little-known accounting firm in [[New City, New York|New City]], north of New York City. The firm consisted of two principals, [[David G. Friehling]] and Jerome Horowitz, and a part-time secretary. Horowitz was semi-retired; Friehling was the sole active practitioner.<ref name=SECFriehling>{{cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/litigation/complaints/2009/comp20959.pdf|title=Securities and Exchange Commission v.

In 2007, Aksia LLC, a hedge fund consultant, warned its clients to stay away from Madoff for that very reason; its CEO, Jim Vos, likened this situation to [[General Motors]] being audited by a three-person firm.<ref>Fitzgerald, Jim.

He only got an office when Madoff told him that some investors were asking questions about the audits. Even then, his operation remained very small; in 2008 it only garnered $180,000 in earnings, far less than conventional wisdom would suggest for a firm that was supposedly earning substantial fees from auditing the Madoff operation. It later emerged that officials at [[Fairfield Greenwich Group]], operator of the largest Madoff [[feeder fund]], had been aware as early as 2005 that Friehling was the firm's sole employee.<ref name=MadoffChronicles/>\n\nFriehling was charged on March 18, 2009, with [[securities fraud]], aiding and abetting [[investment adviser]] fraud, and four counts of filing false audit reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Friehling waived indictment and pleaded not guilty to criminal charges on July 10, 2009.

Investors who filed an involuntary [[personal bankruptcy]] petition against Madoff want his business's U.K. unit's bankruptcy moved to New York because \"overlapping discovery, related assets and common creditors\" among the various cases mean they should be in the same court.\n\nThe Chapter 15 case is ''In re Madoff Securities International Ltd.'', 09-16751, [[U.S. Bankruptcy Court]], Southern District of Florida (West Palm Beach).<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601103&sid=agGTdJJDCZos&refer=us |title=Madoff Investors Want U.K. Unit Bankruptcy Moved (Update1) |publisher=Bloomberg.com |date=April 21, 2009 |accessdate=April 26, 2009 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090122224028/http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601103 |archivedate=January 22, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nOn June 8, 2009 the Chapter 15 case was transferred to the Southern District of New York as ''Madoff Securities International Limited, Stephen John Akers, Mark Richard Byers, and Andrew Laurence as the Joint Provisional Liquidators'', 09-12998, so it can be administered more effectively with the related involuntary bankruptcies against Madoff, and his companies, also filed in New York.

Friehling==\nSince at least 1991, Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities had been audited by Friehling & Horowitz CPAs, a little-known accounting firm in [[New City, New York|New City]], north of New York City. The firm consisted of two principals, [[David G. Friehling]] and Jerome Horowitz, and a part-time secretary. Horowitz was semi-retired; Friehling was the sole active practitioner.<ref name=SECFriehling>{{cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/litigation/complaints/2009/comp20959.pdf|title=Securities and Exchange Commission v.

In 2007, Aksia LLC, a hedge fund consultant, warned its clients to stay away from Madoff for that very reason; its CEO, Jim Vos, likened this situation to [[General Motors]] being audited by a three-person firm.<ref>Fitzgerald, Jim.

He only got an office when Madoff told him that some investors were asking questions about the audits. Even then, his operation remained very small; in 2008 it only garnered $180,000 in earnings, far less than conventional wisdom would suggest for a firm that was supposedly earning substantial fees from auditing the Madoff operation. It later emerged that officials at [[Fairfield Greenwich Group]], operator of the largest Madoff [[feeder fund]], had been aware as early as 2005 that Friehling was the firm's sole employee.<ref name=MadoffChronicles/>\n\nFriehling was charged on March 18, 2009, with [[securities fraud]], aiding and abetting [[investment adviser]] fraud, and four counts of filing false audit reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Friehling waived indictment and pleaded not guilty to criminal charges on July 10, 2009.

The complaint alleges Fiserv failed \"to hold and safeguard assets entrusted to it\" by about 800 Madoff customers who had been told to hire Fiserv to handle their accounts with him.  Fiserv is accused of breach of [[fiduciary]] duty, [[fraud]], [[negligence]], and aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary. Fiserv sold its investment account administration business in 2007 to [[TD Ameritrade]], also a defendant.  The lawsuit estimates Fiserv generated at least $25\u2002million annually from Madoff investors, and claims it wasn't diligent because \"Fiserv had too much revenue at stake to risk upsetting Madoff.\"<ref>{{cite web |last=Gores |first=Paul |url=http://www.jsonline.com/business/43208047.html |title=Fiserv faces suit in Madoff case |publisher=JSOnline |date=April 18, 2009 |accessdate=April 26, 2009 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090424104045/http://www.jsonline.com/business/43208047.html |archivedate=April 24, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn June 2011, Judge Christine M.

Although Madoff was included among Fiserv's investment options, Arguello noted that the IRA agreements provided to Fiserv's investors clearly indemnified the defendants, and that Fiserv \"had no obligation to verify or audit.\"<ref>{{cite web |last=Gores |first=Paul |url=http://www.jsonline.com/business/123773989.html |title=Fiserv not responsible for losses in Madoff scheme, judge rules |publisher=JSOnline |date=June 13, 2011 |accessdate=February 5, 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160206151327/http://www.jsonline.com/business/123773989.html |archivedate=February 6, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n==David and Craig Kugel==\nOn November 16, 2011, longtime Madoff trader David Kugel pleaded guilty to backdating trades for Madoff.
