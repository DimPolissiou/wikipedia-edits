The biggest employment area in Deeside is ''Deeside Industrial Park'', located on the north bank of the Dee on the southern edge of the Wirral peninsula, which has both historical and contemporary significance,<ref name=BBCDeesidePenPicture/> and provides Deeside and the surrounding area with jobs in many different industries from construction to food production. Deeside is also home to steel manufacturer [[Tata Steel]] and [[Toyota]]'s highly advanced engine manufacturing plant.\n\n==History==\n\n===Ancient history===\nShotton's history dates back around 1000 years to Saxon times.<ref name=HistoryofShotton/><ref name=AtkinsonCh1ShottonfrmSaxontimes/> Various settlements within the Deeside area are recorded in the Domesday book (1086) which list them within the [[Hundreds of Cheshire|Cheshire Hundred]] of [[Atiscross|Ati's Cross]]. They are Aston, Broughton, Clayton, Hawarden, Golftyn and Wepre. The largest of these was Hawarden<ref>{{cite web|url=http://domesdaymap.co.uk/place/SJ3165/hawarden/|title=Hawarden - Domesday Book|first=Anna|last=Powell-Smith|publisher=}}</ref> with 14 households.\n\nAs a border region, the Deeside area was subject to frequent conflict between the Welsh and the English in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. In the Battle of Ewloe in 1157, [[Owain Gwynedd]] inflicted a notable defeat on the forces of [[Henry II of England|Henry II]]. [[Ewloe Castle]] was built by [[Llywelyn the Great]] in the early thirteenth century to secure the area. Llywelyn's son and successor, [[Dafydd ap Llywelyn]], was borne in nearby [[Coleshill, Flintshire|Coleshill]] in 1212.\n\n===Recent history===\nUntil industrialisation in the nineteenth century, Shotton remained a cluster of hamlets: a settlement comprising Shotton, Nine Houses and Shotton Hall, which itself dates back to 1637.<ref name=FlintshireChronicleDeesideHistory/><ref name=AtkinsonCh2Shottonfrm13thC/><ref name=AtkinsonCh4ShottonHall/> Coal mining developed in the eighteenth century, then in 1889 the opening of the Hawarden Railway Bridge over the River Dee improved access to the reclaimed Dee Marshes.<ref name=FlintshireChronicleDeesideHistory/> Following this, in 1895, the Summers family purchased {{convert|40|acre|m2}} of Dee marshland,<ref name=BBCShottonSteelworks/> on which they established Shotton Steelworks.<ref name=FlintshireChronicleDeesideHistory/><ref name=BBCShottonSteelworks/>\n\nIn September 1896, Shotton Steelworks began producing sheet steel. The development of this steelworks on the banks of the River Dee changed an area that was once mainly marshland, with Shotton \u2013 just across the Dee \u2013 previously little more than a hamlet. Shotton Steelworks led to the development of whole communities to house the influx of workers, estimated up to 13,000 at the height of the industry,<ref name=BBCShottonSteelworks/> with Shotton and Connah's Quay Jetty hubs of activity serving the steelworks.<ref name=BBCSteelworksJetty/> There were also brickworks and other industries in and around Shotton, and Connah's Quay developed as a town on the banks of the [[Dee Estuary]], becoming known for its shipbuilding industry.<ref name=BBCDeesidePenPicture/>\n\n===City of Chester, Wrexham and Deeside===\n{{Update|section|date=June 2016}}\n\nThe city of Chester, Wrexham and Deeside is a proposed city region spanning the large urban areas of Wrexham and Chester and the community of Deeside. This would be a unique city in the UK as its boundaries would cross the border on England and Wales. A preliminary report has been issued.{{cn|date=November 2017}}\n\n==Education==\nPrimary schools in the area include: Well House Primary School, Bryn Deva Primary, Wepre Primary, Ysgol Cae'r Nant (Brookfield Primary), Golftyn Primary, Venerable Edward Morgan, Sealand County Primary, Sandycroft County Primary, St Ethelwold's Primary School, and most importantly, Queenferry County Primary School.\n\nSecondary schools in the area include: Connah's Quay High School (Connah's Quay), John Summers High School (Queensferry) which closed on 20 July 2017, and St David's High School (Saltney).\n\n===Further Education===\n[[Coleg Cambria]] is a large and popular college in Connah's Quay. It offers a range of full and part-time courses as well as apprenticeships. In an inspection in 2007 the college gained the highest possible grade 1 inspection ratings for its Work Based Learning provision, it was formerly Deeside College, but a College Merger was finalised in August 2013 with Yale College Wrexham, It is now one of the largest College's in the UK and the largest in Wales.\n\n==Transport==\n[[File:Blue Bridge, B5441 4.JPG|thumb|The Blue Bridge over the River Dee.]]\n\nBus travel in Deeside is mainly provided by [[Arriva North West]] who offer services to Chester Bus Exchange from a starting point in Connah's Quay. Arriva also provide a service to [[Rhyl]] in North Wales from Chester which passes through parts of Deeside. Senior citizens are entitled to free public transport to and from Chester.\n\nArriva provide Train services in the Deeside area. The main services are to [[Liverpool]] and [[Manchester]] and to [[Wrexham]] and [[Rhyl]]. There are also services to [[London]] and [[Cardiff]] which call at [[Shotton railway station]]. The other three railway stations in Deeside are Shotton high level railway station, [[Hawarden railway station]] and [[Hawarden Bridge railway station]]. A new station serving Deeside Industrial Estate has been proposed and is currently in the planning stages.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Hemming|first1=Jez|title=Plans for four new North Wales railway stations take 'significant step forward'|url=http://www.dailypost.co.uk/news/north-wales-news/plans-four-new-north-wales-12954428|website=northwales|accessdate=4 November 2017|date=27 April 2017}}</ref>\n\n===The Deeside Shuttle Bus===\nThe Deeside Shuttle Bus is a service which enables people to travel to and from work at a time convenient to them. The Deeside Shuttle Bus allows local residents to book a seat on the bus at a time and place specified by them, which will take them to work on Deeside Industrial Park. It has proved very popular and has now grown to serve other local areas.\n\n==Landmarks==\nThe most striking landmark in Deeside is the fixed cable-stayed bridge, which was opened by [[Queen Elizabeth II]] in 1998.

Deeside is also home to steel manufacturer [[Tata Steel]] and [[Toyota]]'s highly advanced engine manufacturing plant.\n\n==History==\n\n===Ancient history===\nShotton's history dates back around 1000 years to Saxon times.<ref name=HistoryofShotton/><ref name=AtkinsonCh1ShottonfrmSaxontimes/> Various settlements within the Deeside area are recorded in the Domesday book (1086) which list them within the [[Hundreds of Cheshire|Cheshire Hundred]] of [[Atiscross|Ati's Cross]]. They are Aston, Broughton, Clayton, Hawarden, Golftyn and Wepre. The largest of these was Hawarden<ref>{{cite web|url=http://domesdaymap.co.uk/place/SJ3165/hawarden/|title=Hawarden - Domesday Book|first=Anna|last=Powell-Smith|publisher=}}</ref> with 14 households.\n\nAs a border region, the Deeside area was subject to frequent conflict between the Welsh and the English in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. In the Battle of Ewloe in 1157, [[Owain Gwynedd]] inflicted a notable defeat on the forces of [[Henry II of England|Henry II]]. [[Ewloe Castle]] was built by [[Llywelyn the Great]] in the early thirteenth century to secure the area. Llywelyn's son and successor, [[Dafydd ap Llywelyn]], was borne in nearby [[Coleshill, Flintshire|Coleshill]] in 1212.\n\n===Recent history===\nUntil industrialisation in the nineteenth century, Shotton remained a cluster of hamlets: a settlement comprising Shotton, Nine Houses and Shotton Hall, which itself dates back to 1637.<ref name=FlintshireChronicleDeesideHistory/><ref name=AtkinsonCh2Shottonfrm13thC/><ref name=AtkinsonCh4ShottonHall/> Coal mining developed in the eighteenth century, then in 1889 the opening of the Hawarden Railway Bridge over the River Dee improved access to the reclaimed Dee Marshes.<ref name=FlintshireChronicleDeesideHistory/> Following this, in 1895, the Summers family purchased {{convert|40|acre|m2}} of Dee marshland,<ref name=BBCShottonSteelworks/> on which they established Shotton Steelworks.<ref name=FlintshireChronicleDeesideHistory/><ref name=BBCShottonSteelworks/>\n\nIn September 1896, Shotton Steelworks began producing sheet steel. The development of this steelworks on the banks of the River Dee changed an area that was once mainly marshland, with Shotton \u2013 just across the Dee \u2013 previously little more than a hamlet. Shotton Steelworks led to the development of whole communities to house the influx of workers, estimated up to 13,000 at the height of the industry,<ref name=BBCShottonSteelworks/> with Shotton and Connah's Quay Jetty hubs of activity serving the steelworks.<ref name=BBCSteelworksJetty/> There were also brickworks and other industries in and around Shotton, and Connah's Quay developed as a town on the banks of the [[Dee Estuary]], becoming known for its shipbuilding industry.<ref name=BBCDeesidePenPicture/>\n\n===City of Chester, Wrexham and Deeside===\n{{Update|section|date=June 2016}}\n\nThe city of Chester, Wrexham and Deeside is a proposed city region spanning the large urban areas of Wrexham and Chester and the community of Deeside.

There are different subject agreement paradigms for transitive vs. intransitive predicates. For intransitive predicates, there are three distinct subject paradigms, one of which is glossed as 'subjunctive' by van Eijk (1997) and Davis (2006)\n\n==Sample text==\n\nThe following is a portion of a story in van Eijk (1981:87) told by Rosie Joseph of Mount Currie.\n\n'''St'at'imcets:'''\n<blockquote>\nNilh aylh lts7a sM\u00e1ma ti h\u00faz\u0313a qweqwl\u2019el\u2019tm\u00ednan.

In this case the consonant before a stressed vowel is reduplicated after the stressed vowel and usually the vowel then changes to ''e'' (IPA: {{IPA|[\u0259]}}). Examples are below:\n\n{| style=\"line-height: 1.4em;\" cellpadding=\"2\"\n|-\n| &nbsp;\n| &nbsp;\n! style=\"text-align: left;\" colspan=\"4\" | Internal reduplication:\n|-\n| &nbsp;\n| &nbsp;\n| ''naxw\u00edt''\n| <small>'snake'</small>\n| \u2192\n| ''naxw\u00e9xwt''\n| <small>'worm'</small>\n| (naxw\u00e9-xw-t)\n|-\n| &nbsp;\n| &nbsp;\n| ''sq\u00e1xa7''\n| <small>'dog'</small>\n| \u2192\n| ''sq\u00e9qxa7''\n| <small>'pup'</small>\n| (sq\u00e9-q-xa7)\n|-\n| &nbsp;\n| &nbsp;\n| ''sql\u00e1w\u2019''\n| <small>'beaver'</small>\n| \u2192\n| ''sql\u00e9lew\u2019''\n| <small>'little beaver'</small>\n| (sql\u00e9-l-ew\u2019)\n| <small>(the extra ''e'' here is an [[epenthesis|epenthetic]] vowel)</small>\n|}\n\nMore than one reduplicative process can occur in a given word:\n\n{| style=\"line-height: 1.2em;\" cellpadding=\"5\"\n! style=\"text-align: left;\" colspan=\"4\" | &nbsp;\n! style=\"text-align: left;\" colspan=\"2\" | Diminutive\n! style=\"text-align: left;\" colspan=\"2\" | Plural+Diminutive\n|-\n| &nbsp;\n| &nbsp;\n| ''sq\u00e1xa7''\n| <small>'dog'</small>\n| ''sq\u00e9qxa7''\n| <small>'pup'</small>\n| ''sqexq\u00e9qxa7''\n| <small>'pups'</small>\n|-\n| &nbsp;\n| &nbsp;\n| ''s-q\u00e1xa7''\n| &nbsp;\n| ''s-q\u00e9-q-xa7''\n| &nbsp;\n| ''s-qex-q\u00e9-q-xa7''\n| &nbsp;\n|}\n\nSt\u2019\u00e1t\u2019imcets has several other variants of the above types. Reduplication is further complicated by consonant glottalization (see van Eijk (1997) for details).\n\n===Mood and modality===\nThe [[subjunctive mood]] appears in nine distinct environments, with a range of semantic effects, including:\n* weakening an imperative to a polite request,\n* turning a question into an uncertainty statement,\n* creating an ignorance free relative.\nThe St\u2019\u00e1t\u2019imcets subjunctive also differs from Indo-European subjunctives in that it is not selected by attitude verbs.\n\nSt\u2019\u00e1t\u2019imcets has a complex system of subject and object agreement. There are different subject agreement paradigms for transitive vs. intransitive predicates. For intransitive predicates, there are three distinct subject paradigms, one of which is glossed as 'subjunctive' by van Eijk (1997) and Davis (2006)\n\n==Sample text==\n\nThe following is a portion of a story in van Eijk (1981:87) told by Rosie Joseph of Mount Currie.\n\n'''St'at'imcets:'''\n<blockquote>\nNilh aylh lts7a sM\u00e1ma ti h\u00faz\u0313a qweqwl\u2019el\u2019tm\u00ednan.

Davis was the fifth and longest-serving president of [[West Virginia State University|West Virginia State College]] in [[Institute, West Virginia]], from 1919 to 1953. Born in [[Milledgeville, Georgia]], Davis relocated to [[Atlanta]] in 1903 to attend high school at Atlanta Baptist College (later known as [[Morehouse College]]). He worked his way through high school and college at Morehouse, and graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in 1911. At Morehouse, Davis formed associations with [[John Hope (educator)|John Hope]], [[Mordecai Wyatt Johnson]], [[Samuel Archer]], [[Benjamin Griffith Brawley]], [[Booker T. Washington]], and [[W. E. B. Du Bois]]. He completed [[Graduate school|graduate studies]] in chemistry and physics at the [[University of Chicago]] from 1911 to 1913, and served on the faculty of Morehouse as the [[Registrar (education)|registrar]] and as a professor in chemistry and physics. While in Atlanta, Davis helped to found one of the city's first chapters of the [[NAACP|National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP).\n\nDavis served as the executive secretary of the [[Twelfth Street YMCA Building|Twelfth Street YMCA]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] from 1917 to 1919, when he was elected as the president of West Virginia Collegiate Institute. Under Davis' leadership, West Virginia Collegiate Institute (later renamed West Virginia State College) became one of the leading [[historically black colleges and universities]] and [[Land-grant university|land-grant universities]] in the United States, in both academics and athletics. Through Davis' efforts, West Virginia Collegiate Institute became the first African American college to be [[Educational accreditation|accredited]] by the [[North Central Association of Colleges and Schools]] (NCA) in 1927. Under Davis' leadership, the college became home to the West Virginia Schools for the Colored Deaf and Blind and to West Virginia's [[Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service|Extension Service]] for African Americans. Davis also secured a [[Civilian Pilot Training Program]] (CPTP) and [[Army Specialized Training Program]] (ASTP) unit for the college during [[World War II]]. Through his efforts and educational statesmanship, Davis laid the groundwork for West Virginia State's transition into an integrated institution, and white students began enrolling in large numbers toward the end of his presidency.\n\nDavis was appointed by U.S. President [[Harry S. Truman]] as a charter member to the first [[National Science Board]] for the [[National Science Foundation]], on which he served from 1950 to 1956. In addition, President Truman appointed Davis as the director of the [[Point Four Program|Technical Cooperation Administration]] program in [[Liberia]] from 1952 to 1954. Davis helped to establish the [[NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund]] (NAACP LDF), and he served as special director of the NAACP LDF Teacher Information and Security Program from 1955 to 1972. In this role, Davis administered the NAACP LDF's scholarship programs for African American undergraduate, graduate, and professional students. In his later life, Davis was appointed to the U.S. National Commission for the [[UNESCO|United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO) and served as a member of the [[Bergen Community College|Bergen County College]] board of trustees. Davis continued to work as an active consultant for the NAACP LDF and serve as the head of its Herbert Lehmann Fund until his death in 1980. Davis was a recipient of 14 [[honorary degrees]] throughout his lifetime, and he was awarded [[Haiti]]'s [[National Order of Honour and Merit]] (1948) and Liberia's [[Order of the Star of Africa]] for his service to those countries.\n\n== Early life and education == \nJohn Warren Davis was born on 11 February 1888 in [[Milledgeville, Georgia]].<ref name=\"WVAH 1\">{{cite web |url= http://www.wvculture.org/history/archives/blacks/jwdavis.html |title= John Warren Davis  |author= West Virginia Archives and History |year= 2019 |publisher= West Virginia Department of Arts, Culture and History |access-date= 29 February 2020 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20200229171815/http://www.wvculture.org/history/archives/blacks/jwdavis.html |archive-date= 29 February 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"The Record 1\">{{cite newspaper | last = Anderson | first = Gene | title = Dr. John Warren Davis, adviser to five presidents | newspaper = [[The Record (North Jersey)|The Record]] | location = [[Hackensack, New Jersey]] | date = 13 July 1980 | page = 22 | url = https://www.newspapers.com/clip/46009114/dr-john-warren-davis-adviser-to-five/ | accessdate = 2 March 2020 | via = [[Newspapers.com]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20200302233738/https://www.newspapers.com/clip/46009114/dr-john-warren-davis-adviser-to-five/ | archive-date = 2 March 2020}}</ref> He was the son of Robert Marion Davis, a merchant, and his wife, Katie Mann Davis.<ref name=\"WVAH 1\"/><ref name=\"MSRC 2015 4\">{{Harvnb|Moorland\u2013Spingarn Research Center Staff|2015|p=4.}}</ref> Davis' mother, Katie Mann Davis, was the biracial daughter of a white pastor.<ref name=\"Bardolph 123\">{{Harvnb|Bardolph|1959|p=123.}}</ref> Davis was raised at his maternal grandfather's home from the age of five, after his parents relocated to [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]] with their other children.<ref name=\"Bardolph 123\"/>\n\nDavis attended elementary school in Milledgeville; however, since there were no public high schools for [[African Americans]] in the U.S. state of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], Davis relocated to [[Atlanta]] in 1903 to attend [[Morehouse College|Atlanta Baptist College]] (later known as Morehouse College).<ref name=\"MSRC 2015 4\"/><ref name=\"Garibaldi x\">{{Harvnb|Garibaldi|1984|p=x.}}</ref> He worked his way through high school and college at Morehouse,<ref name=\"Garibaldi x\"/> and gained the attention of the college's first African American president, [[John Hope (educator)|John Hope]], while polishing the floor of the president's house.<ref name=\"Bardolph 130\">{{Harvnb|Bardolph|1959|p=130.}}</ref> Hope, known as \"the maker of college presidents,\" elevated Davis to a position in the college's business office.<ref name=\"Bardolph 130\"/> Davis completed the school's academic course in 1907<ref name=\"Morehouse College 1921 99\">{{Harvnb|Morehouse College|1921|p=99.}}</ref> and graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] (with honors) in 1911.<ref name=\"The Record 1\"/><ref name=\"Garibaldi x\"/><ref name=\"Morehouse College 1921 89\">{{Harvnb|Morehouse College|1921|p=89.}}</ref>\n\nWhile attending Morehouse, Davis was a roommate of [[Mordecai Wyatt Johnson]], who later served as president of [[Howard University]], and remained a longstanding friend of Davis.<ref name=\"Garibaldi x\"/><ref name=\"Gloster 1981 78\">{{Harvnb|Gloster|1981|p=78.}}</ref> Davis and Johnson both played for Morehouse's [[American football|football team]], on which Davis was a [[defensive end]].<ref name=\"Wesley 1981 76\">{{Harvnb|Wesley|1981|p=76.}}</ref> Davis and Johnson befriended [[Charles H.

Davis was the fifth and longest-serving president of [[West Virginia State University|West Virginia State College]] in [[Institute, West Virginia]], from 1919 to 1953. Born in [[Milledgeville, Georgia]], Davis relocated to [[Atlanta]] in 1903 to attend high school at Atlanta Baptist College (later known as [[Morehouse College]]). He worked his way through high school and college at Morehouse, and graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in 1911. At Morehouse, Davis formed associations with [[John Hope (educator)|John Hope]], [[Mordecai Wyatt Johnson]], [[Samuel Archer]], [[Benjamin Griffith Brawley]], [[Booker T. Washington]], and [[W. E. B. Du Bois]]. He completed [[Graduate school|graduate studies]] in chemistry and physics at the [[University of Chicago]] from 1911 to 1913, and served on the faculty of Morehouse as the [[Registrar (education)|registrar]] and as a professor in chemistry and physics. While in Atlanta, Davis helped to found one of the city's first chapters of the [[NAACP|National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP).\n\nDavis served as the executive secretary of the [[Twelfth Street YMCA Building|Twelfth Street YMCA]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] from 1917 to 1919, when he was elected as the president of West Virginia Collegiate Institute. Under Davis' leadership, West Virginia Collegiate Institute (later renamed West Virginia State College) became one of the leading [[historically black colleges and universities]] and [[Land-grant university|land-grant universities]] in the United States, in both academics and athletics. Through Davis' efforts, West Virginia Collegiate Institute became the first African American college to be [[Educational accreditation|accredited]] by the [[North Central Association of Colleges and Schools]] (NCA) in 1927. Under Davis' leadership, the college became home to the West Virginia Schools for the Colored Deaf and Blind and to West Virginia's [[Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service|Extension Service]] for African Americans. Davis also secured a [[Civilian Pilot Training Program]] (CPTP) and [[Army Specialized Training Program]] (ASTP) unit for the college during [[World War II]]. Through his efforts and educational statesmanship, Davis laid the groundwork for West Virginia State's transition into an integrated institution, and white students began enrolling in large numbers toward the end of his presidency.\n\nDavis was appointed by U.S. President [[Harry S. Truman]] as a charter member to the first [[National Science Board]] for the [[National Science Foundation]], on which he served from 1950 to 1956. In addition, President Truman appointed Davis as the director of the [[Point Four Program|Technical Cooperation Administration]] program in [[Liberia]] from 1952 to 1954. Davis helped to establish the [[NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund]] (NAACP LDF), and he served as special director of the NAACP LDF Teacher Information and Security Program from 1955 to 1972. In this role, Davis administered the NAACP LDF's scholarship programs for African American undergraduate, graduate, and professional students. In his later life, Davis was appointed to the U.S. National Commission for the [[UNESCO|United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO) and served as a member of the [[Bergen Community College|Bergen County College]] board of trustees. Davis continued to work as an active consultant for the NAACP LDF and serve as the head of its Herbert Lehmann Fund until his death in 1980. Davis was a recipient of 14 [[honorary degrees]] throughout his lifetime, and he was awarded [[Haiti]]'s [[National Order of Honour and Merit]] (1948) and [[Liberia]]'s [[Order of the Star of Africa]] for his service to those countries.\n\n== Early life and education == \nJohn Warren Davis was born on 11 February 1888 in [[Milledgeville, Georgia]].<ref name=\"WVAH 1\">{{cite web |url= http://www.wvculture.org/history/archives/blacks/jwdavis.html |title= John Warren Davis  |author= West Virginia Archives and History |year= 2019 |publisher= West Virginia Department of Arts, Culture and History |access-date= 29 February 2020 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20200229171815/http://www.wvculture.org/history/archives/blacks/jwdavis.html |archive-date= 29 February 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"The Record 1\">{{cite newspaper | last = Anderson | first = Gene | title = Dr. John Warren Davis, adviser to five presidents | newspaper = [[The Record (North Jersey)|The Record]] | location = [[Hackensack, New Jersey]] | date = 13 July 1980 | page = 22 | url = https://www.newspapers.com/clip/46009114/dr-john-warren-davis-adviser-to-five/ | accessdate = 2 March 2020 | via = [[Newspapers.com]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20200302233738/https://www.newspapers.com/clip/46009114/dr-john-warren-davis-adviser-to-five/ | archive-date = 2 March 2020}}</ref> He was the son of Robert Marion Davis, a merchant, and his wife, Katie Mann Davis.<ref name=\"WVAH 1\"/><ref name=\"MSRC 2015 4\">{{Harvnb|Moorland\u2013Spingarn Research Center Staff|2015|p=4.}}</ref> Davis' mother, Katie Mann Davis, was the biracial daughter of a white pastor.<ref name=\"Bardolph 123\">{{Harvnb|Bardolph|1959|p=123.}}</ref> Davis was raised at his maternal grandfather's home from the age of five, after his parents relocated to [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]] with their other children.<ref name=\"Bardolph 123\"/>\n\nDavis attended elementary school in Milledgeville; however, since there were no public high schools for [[African Americans]] in the U.S. state of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], Davis relocated to [[Atlanta]] in 1903 to attend [[Morehouse College|Atlanta Baptist College]] (later known as Morehouse College).<ref name=\"MSRC 2015 4\"/><ref name=\"Garibaldi x\">{{Harvnb|Garibaldi|1984|p=x.}}</ref> He worked his way through high school and college at Morehouse,<ref name=\"Garibaldi x\"/> and gained the attention of the college's first African American president, [[John Hope (educator)|John Hope]], while polishing the floor of the president's house.<ref name=\"Bardolph 130\">{{Harvnb|Bardolph|1959|p=130.}}</ref> Hope, known as \"the maker of college presidents,\" elevated Davis to a position in the college's business office.<ref name=\"Bardolph 130\"/> Davis completed the school's academic course in 1907<ref name=\"Morehouse College 1921 99\">{{Harvnb|Morehouse College|1921|p=99.}}</ref> and graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] (with honors) in 1911.<ref name=\"The Record 1\"/><ref name=\"Garibaldi x\"/><ref name=\"Morehouse College 1921 89\">{{Harvnb|Morehouse College|1921|p=89.}}</ref>\n\nWhile attending Morehouse, Davis was a roommate of [[Mordecai Wyatt Johnson]], who later served as president of [[Howard University]], and remained a longstanding friend of Davis.<ref name=\"Garibaldi x\"/><ref name=\"Gloster 1981 78\">{{Harvnb|Gloster|1981|p=78.}}</ref> Davis and Johnson both played for Morehouse's [[American football|football team]], on which Davis was a [[defensive end]].<ref name=\"Wesley 1981 76\">{{Harvnb|Wesley|1981|p=76.}}</ref> Davis and Johnson befriended [[Charles H.

Whereas [[Mississippi]]an and [[Pennsylvania]] Age rock layers are deep beneath the soil surface in central Illinois, these strata pierce the surface in southern Illinois. The Shawnee Hills are surface expressions of the more weather-resistant limestone and [[sandstone]] layers.  This formation is due in part to the last glaciation of the Ice Age (which tended to grind down hills and bury them under soil) not reaching this far south.   \n\n[[Shawnee]] is the name used for a native American people, who historically resided in the [[Ohio Valley]]. The Shawnee Hills are often called the \"Illinois Ozarks\", especially in promotional literature for tourism.

From the beginning, similarities between Benoit and Billington were apparent, as Benoit adopted many of his moves such as the [[Diving head butt|diving headbutt]] and the [[Suplex#Snap suplex|snap suplex]]; the homage was complete with his initial billing as \"Dynamite\" Chris Benoit. According to Benoit, in his first match, he attempted the diving headbutt before learning how to land correctly, and had the wind knocked out of him; he said he would never do the move again at that point. His debut match was a tag team match on November 22, 1985 in [[Calgary]], [[Alberta]], where he teamed with \"The Remarkable\" Rick Patterson against Butch Moffat and Mike Hammer, which Benoit's team won the match after Benoit pinned Moffat with a [[Professional wrestling aerial techniques#Sunset flip|sunset flip]].<ref name=\"archive\"/> The first title Benoit ever won was the [[Stampede British Commonwealth Mid-Heavyweight Championship]] on March 18, 1988 against [[Gadowar Singh Sahota|Gama Singh]].<ref name=\"stampede\">{{cite web |url=http://www.wrestling-titles.com/canada/ab/stampede/ab-bc-mh.html |title=Stampede Wrestling British Commonwealth Mid-Heavyweight Title |publisher=wrestling-titles.com |accessdate=February 8, 2019}}</ref> During his tenure in Stampede, he won four International Tag Team and three more British Commonwealth titles,<ref name=\"Titles\">{{cite book |author=Royal Duncan & Gary Will |title=Wrestling Title Histories |publisher=Archeus Communications |edition=4th |year=2006 |isbn=0-9698161-5-4}}</ref> and had a lengthy [[Feud (professional wrestling)|feud]] with [[John Hindley|Johnny Smith]] that lasted for over a year, which both men traded back-and-forth the British Commonwealth title. In 1989, Stampede closed its doors later that year, and with a recommendation from [[Allen Coage|Bad News Allen]], Benoit departed for [[New Japan Pro-Wrestling]].\n\n=== New Japan Pro-Wrestling (1986\u20131994) ===\nUpon arriving in New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW), Benoit spent about a year training in their \"New Japan Dojo\" with the younger wrestlers to improve his abilities. While in the dojo, he spent months doing strenuous activities like push ups and floor sweeping before stepping into the ring. He made his Japanese debut in 1986 under his real name. In 1989, he started wearing a mask and assuming the [[Ring name|name]] The Pegasus Kid. Benoit said numerous times that he originally hated the mask, but it eventually became a part of him. While with NJPW, he came into his own as a performer in critically acclaimed matches with luminaries like [[Jushin Thunder Liger]], [[Shinjiro Otani]], [[Eddie Guerrero|Black Tiger]], and [[El Samurai]] in their junior heavyweight division.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nIn August 1990, he won his first major championship, the [[IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship]], from Jushin Thunder Liger. He eventually lost the title in November 1990 (and in July 1991 in Japan and in November 1991 in Mexico, his [[Luchas de Apuestas|mask]]) back to Liger,<ref name=\"Titles\"/> forcing him to reinvent himself as Wild Pegasus. Benoit spent the next couple years in Japan, winning the [[Best of the Super Juniors]] tournament twice in [[Best of the Super Juniors#1993|1993]] and [[Best of the Super Juniors#1995|1995]]. He went on to win the [[Super J-Cup (1994)|inaugural]] [[Super J-Cup|Super J-Cup tournament]] in 1994, defeating Black Tiger, [[Gedo (wrestler)|Gedo]], and [[The Great Sasuke]] in the finals. He wrestled outside New Japan occasionally to compete in Mexico and Europe, where he won a few regional championships, including the [[WWF Light Heavyweight Championship]]. He held that title for over a year, having many forty-plus minute matches with [[Villano III]].{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\n=== World Championship Wrestling (1992\u20131993) ===\nBenoit first came to [[World Championship Wrestling]] in June 1992, teaming up with fellow Canadian wrestler [[Biff Wellington]] for the [[NWA World Tag Team Championship]] tournament; they were defeated by [[Brian Pillman]] and Jushin Thunder Liger in the first round at [[Clash of the Champions XIX]].\n\nHe did not return to WCW until January 1993 at ''[[Clash of the Champions XXII]]'', defeating [[Brad Armstrong (wrestler)|Brad Armstrong]]. A month later, at [[SuperBrawl III]], he lost to [[2 Cold Scorpio]], getting pinned with only three seconds left in the 20-minute time limit. At the same time, he formed a tag team with [[Bobby Eaton]]. After he and Eaton lost to Scorpio and [[Marcus Bagwell]] at [[Slamboree (1993)|Slamboree]], Benoit headed back to Japan.\n\n=== Extreme Championship Wrestling (1994\u20131995) ===\nIn 1994, Benoit began working with [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]] (ECW) in between tours of Japan. He was booked as a dominant wrestler there, gaining notoriety as the \"Crippler\" after he put [[Rocco Rock]] out. In August 1994, Benoit competed in a [[NWA World Title Tournament|one-night eight-man tournament]] for the vacant [[NWA World Heavyweight Championship]], losing to [[2 Cold Scorpio]] in the quarter-finals.<ref name=\"Williams2013\">{{cite book |author=Scott E.

From that point until his departure from ECW, he was known as \"Crippler Benoit\". When he returned to WCW in October 1995, WCW modified his ring name to \"Canadian Crippler Chris Benoit\". In ''The Rise and Fall of ECW'' book, Heyman commented that he planned on using Benoit as a dominant heel for quite some time, before putting the company's main title, the [[ECW World Heavyweight Championship]], on him to be the long-term champion of the company.\n\nBenoit and [[Dean Malenko]] won the [[ECW World Tag Team Championship]] from Sabu and [[Tazz|The Tazmaniac]] in February 1995, Benoit's first American title.<ref name=\"Titles\"/> After winning, they were initiated into the [[The Triple Threat|Triple Threat]] [[List of professional wrestling terms#S|stable]], led by ECW World Heavyweight Champion, [[Shane Douglas]], as Douglas's attempt to recreate the [[Four Horsemen (professional wrestling)|Four Horsemen]], as the three-man contingency held all three of the ECW championships at the time (Malenko also held the [[ECW World Television Championship]] at the time). The team lost the championship to [[The Public Enemy (professional wrestling)|The Public Enemy]] that April at ECW Three Way Dance. Benoit spent some time in ECW feuding with [[The Steiner Brothers]] and rekindling the feud with 2 Cold Scorpio. He was forced to leave ECW after his work visa expired; Heyman was supposed to renew it, but he failed to make it on time, so Benoit left as a matter of job security and the ability to enter the United States. He toured Japan until WCW called.<ref name=\"Titles\"/>\n\n=== Return to WCW ===\n====The Four Horsemen (1995&ndash;1999)====\n[[New Japan Pro-Wrestling]] and [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW) had a working relationship, and because of their \"talent exchange\" program, Benoit signed with WCW in late 1995 along with a number of talent working in New Japan to be a part of the [[List of professional wrestling terms#A|angle]]. Like the majority of those who came to WCW in the exchange, he started out in as a member of the [[cruiserweight (professional wrestling)|cruiserweight]] division, having lengthy matches against many of his former rivals in Japan on almost every single broadcast. At the end of 1995, Benoit went back to Japan as a part of the \"talent exchange\" to wrestle as a representative for New Japan in the [[Super J-Cup#1995|Super J-Cup: 2nd Stage]], defeating [[Chris Jericho|Lionheart]] in the quarterfinals (he received a bye to the quarterfinals for his work in 1995, similar to the way he advanced in the 1994 edition) and losing to [[Keiji Takayama|Gedo]] in the semifinals.\n\n[[File:Lisa and Chris Benoit.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1|Benoit with a fan during his time in WCW]]\nAfter impressing higher-ups with his work, he was approached by [[Ric Flair]] and the WCW booking staff to become a member of the reformed [[Four Horsemen (professional wrestling)|Four Horsemen]] in 1995, alongside Flair, [[Arn Anderson]], and [[Brian Pillman]]; he was introduced by Pillman as a gruff, no-nonsense heel similar to his ECW persona, \"The Crippler\". He was brought in to add a new dynamic for Anderson and Flair's tormenting of [[Hulk Hogan]] and [[Randy Savage]] in their \"Alliance to End Hulkamania\", which saw the Horsemen team up with [[The Dungeon of Doom]], but that alliance ended with Dungeon leader and WCW [[List of professional wrestling terms#B|booker]], [[Kevin Sullivan (wrestler)|Kevin Sullivan]] feuding with Pillman. When Pillman abruptly left the company for the WWF, Benoit was placed into his ongoing feud with Sullivan. This came to fruition through a dissension between the two in a tag team match with the two reluctantly teaming with each other against [[The Public Enemy (professional wrestling)|The Public Enemy]], and Benoit being attacked by Sullivan at [[Slamboree 1996|Slamboree]]. This led to the two having violent confrontations at [[pay-per-view]]s, which led to Sullivan booking a feud in which Benoit was having an [[affair]] with Sullivan's real life wife and [[Kayfabe|onscreen]] [[List of professional wrestling terms#V|valet]], [[Nancy Benoit|Nancy]] (also known as Woman). Benoit and Nancy were forced to spend time together to make the affair look real, (hold hands in public, share hotel rooms, etc.).<ref>[http://www.metafilter.com/62384/Chris-Benoit-19672007 Chris Benoit (1967\u20132007) profile], MetaFilter.com; accessed June 30, 2015.</ref>\n\nThis onscreen relationship developed into a real-life affair offscreen. As a result, Sullivan and Benoit had a contentious backstage relationship at best. Benoit did, however, admit having a certain amount of respect for Sullivan, saying on the DVD ''[[Hard Knocks: The Chris Benoit Story]]'' that Sullivan never took undue liberties in the ring during their feud, even though he blamed Benoit for breaking up his marriage. This continued for over the course of a year with Sullivan having his [[enforcer (professional wrestling)|enforcers]] apprehend Benoit in a multitude of matches. This culminated in a [[retirement match]] at the [[Bash at the Beach 1997|Bash at the Beach]], where Benoit defeated Sullivan; this was used to explain Sullivan going to a behind-the-scenes role, where he could focus on his initial job of booking.\n\nIn 1998, Benoit had a long feud with [[Booker T (wrestler)|Booker T]]. They fought over the [[WCW World Television Championship]] until Booker lost the title to [[Dave Finlay|Fit Finlay]].<ref name=\"Titles\"/> Booker won a \"Best-of-Seven\" series which was held between the two to determine a number one contender. Benoit went up 3 to 1 before Booker caught up, forcing the 7th and final match on [[WCW Monday Nitro|''Monday Nitro'']]. During the match, [[Bret Hart]] interjected himself, interfering on behalf of Benoit in an attempt to get him to join the [[New World Order (professional wrestling)|New World Order]]. Benoit refused to win that way and told the referee what happened, getting himself disqualified. Booker refused that victory, instead opting for an eighth match at the [[Great American Bash 1998|Great American Bash]] to see who would fight Finlay later that night. Booker won the final match and went on to beat Finlay for the title.<ref name=\"Titles\"/> This feud significantly elevated both men's careers as singles competitors, and both remained at the top of the midcard afterward.\n\nIn 1999, Benoit teamed with Dean Malenko once again and defeated [[Curt Hennig]] and [[Barry Windham]] to win the [[WCW World Tag Team Championship]].<ref name=\"Titles\"/> This led to a reformation of the Four Horsemen with the tag team champions, Anderson, and [[Steve McMichael|Steve \"Mongo\" McMichael]]. The two hunted after the tag team championship for several months, feuding with teams like [[Raven (wrestler)|Raven]] and [[Perry Saturn]] or [[Billy Kidman]] and [[Rey Mysterio, Jr.]] \n\n====The Revolution and World Heavyweight Champion (1999&ndash;2000)====\nAfter a falling out with Anderson and McMichael, Benoit and Malenko left the Horsemen; he won the [[WWE United States Championship|WCW United States Heavyweight Championship]]<ref name=\"Titles\"/> before bringing together Malenko, Perry Saturn, and [[Shane Douglas]] to form \"[[Revolution (professional wrestling)|The Revolution]]\".\n\nThe Revolution was a heel stable of younger wrestlers who felt slighted (both kayfabe and legitimate) by WCW management, believing they never gave them the chance to be stars, [[Push (professional wrestling)|pushing]] older, more established wrestlers instead, despite their then-current questionable worthiness of their pushes. This led to the Revolution seceding from WCW, and forming their own nation, complete with a flag. This led to some friction being created between Benoit and leader, Douglas, who called into question Benoit's heart in the group, causing Benoit to quit the group, thus turning face, and having his own crusade against the top stars, winning the Television title one more time and the United States title from [[Jeff Jarrett]] in a [[ladder match]]. In October 1999 on ''Nitro'' in [[Kansas City, Missouri]], Benoit wrestled Bret Hart as a tribute to [[Owen Hart]], who had recently died due to an [[Over the Edge (1999)#Owen Hart accident|equipment malfunction]]. Hart defeated Benoit by submission, and the two received a standing ovation, and an embrace from guest ring announcer, [[Harley Race]].\n\nBenoit was unhappy working for WCW.<ref name=\"unhappy\">{{cite web |url=http://slam.canoe.com/SlamWrestlingArchive/apr17_ring.html |title=Ring of intrigue in WWF shows |last=Cole |first=Glenn |date=April 17, 1999 |work=SLAM!

After losing their \"tryout matches\" upon entry, The Radicalz aligned themselves with WWF Champion [[Triple H]] and became a [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]] [[glossary of professional wrestling terms#Faction|faction]]. Benoit quickly won his first title in the WWF just over a month later at [[WrestleMania 2000]], pinning [[Chris Jericho]] in a triple threat match to win [[Kurt Angle]]'s [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|Intercontinental Championship]]. It was also in this time period that Benoit wrestled in his first WWF pay-per-view main events, challenging [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]] for the [[WWE Championship|WWF Championship]] at [[Fully Loaded (2000)|Fully Loaded]] in July and as part of a fatal four way title match at [[Unforgiven (2000)|Unforgiven]] in September. On both occasions Benoit appeared to have won the title, only to have the decision reversed by then-WWF [[Professional wrestling authority figures|commissioner]] [[Mick Foley]] due to cheating on Benoit's part. Benoit simultaneously entered into a long-running feud with Jericho for the Intercontinental title, with the two meeting at [[Backlash (2000)|Backlash]], [[Judgment Day (2000)|Judgment Day]] and [[SummerSlam (2000)|SummerSlam]]; Benoit winning all three matches. The feud finally culminated in Jericho defeating Benoit in a [[ladder match]] at the [[Royal Rumble (2001)|Royal Rumble]] in January 2001. Benoit won the Intercontinental title three times between April 2000 and January 2001.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nIn early 2001, Benoit broke away from The Radicalz (who had recently reformed three months earlier) and turned face, feuding first with his former stablemates and then with Kurt Angle, whom he wrestled and lost to at [[WrestleMania X-Seven]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.otherarena.com/htm/cgi-bin/history.cgi?2001/wwf040101 |title=WrestleMania X-Seven report |accessdate=February 9, 2008 |publisher=The Other Arena |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080404173136/http://www.otherarena.com/htm/cgi-bin/history.cgi?2001%2Fwwf040101 |archivedate=April 4, 2008 |url-status=dead |df=}}</ref> He gained some amount of revenge after beating Angle in a \"Ultimiate Submission\" match at [[Backlash (2001)|Backlash]]. The feud continued after Benoit stole Angle's cherished [[Gold medal|Olympic Gold Medal]]. This culminated in a match at [[Judgment Day (2001)|Judgment Day]] where Angle won a [[Professional wrestling match types#Series variations|two out of three falls match]] with the help of [[Edge and Christian]]. In response, Benoit teamed up with his former rival Jericho to defeat Edge and Christian in that night's [[professional wrestling tag team match types#Tag Team Turmoil|Tag Team Turmoil match]].\n\nThe next night on ''[[WWE Raw|Raw Is War]]'', Benoit and Jericho defeated [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|WWF Tag Team Champions]] [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]] and Triple H for their title. The pair used the win as a springboard to challenge Austin for his WWF Championship. Benoit got two title matches the following week, first losing in a manner similar to the [[Montreal Screwjob]] in Calgary and then losing in a close match in Benoit's hometown of Edmonton. However, Benoit suffered a neck injury in a four-way [[Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match|TLC match]] that required surgery with [[Lloyd Youngblood|Dr. Lloyd Youngblood]]. Despite this, he continued to wrestle until the [[King of the Ring (2001)|King of the Ring]], where he was pinned in a triple threat match versus Austin and Jericho.

From the beginning, similarities between Benoit and Billington were apparent, as Benoit adopted many of his moves such as the [[Diving head butt|diving headbutt]] and the [[Suplex#Snap suplex|snap suplex]]; the homage was complete with his initial billing as \"Dynamite\" Chris Benoit. According to Benoit, in his first match, he attempted the diving headbutt before learning how to land correctly, and had the wind knocked out of him; he said he would never do the move again at that point. His debut match was a tag team match on November 22, 1985 in [[Calgary]], [[Alberta]], where he teamed with \"The Remarkable\" Rick Patterson against Butch Moffat and Mike Hammer, which Benoit's team won the match after Benoit pinned Moffat with a [[Professional wrestling aerial techniques#Sunset flip|sunset flip]].<ref name=\"archive\"/> The first title Benoit ever won was the [[Stampede British Commonwealth Mid-Heavyweight Championship]] on March 18, 1988 against [[Gadowar Singh Sahota|Gama Singh]].<ref name=\"stampede\">{{cite web |url=http://www.wrestling-titles.com/canada/ab/stampede/ab-bc-mh.html |title=Stampede Wrestling British Commonwealth Mid-Heavyweight Title |publisher=wrestling-titles.com |accessdate=February 8, 2019}}</ref> During his tenure in Stampede, he won four International Tag Team and three more British Commonwealth titles,<ref name=\"Titles\">{{cite book |author=Royal Duncan & Gary Will |title=Wrestling Title Histories |publisher=Archeus Communications |edition=4th |year=2006 |isbn=0-9698161-5-4}}</ref> and had a lengthy [[Feud (professional wrestling)|feud]] with [[John Hindley|Johnny Smith]] that lasted for over a year, which both men traded back-and-forth the British Commonwealth title. In 1989, Stampede closed its doors later that year, and with a recommendation from [[Allen Coage|Bad News Allen]], Benoit departed for [[New Japan Pro-Wrestling]].\n\n=== New Japan Pro-Wrestling (1986\u20131994) ===\nUpon arriving in New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW), Benoit spent about a year training in their \"New Japan Dojo\" with the younger wrestlers to improve his abilities. While in the dojo, he spent months doing strenuous activities like push ups and floor sweeping before stepping into the ring. He made his Japanese debut in 1986 under his real name. In 1989, he started wearing a mask and assuming the [[Ring name|name]] The Pegasus Kid. Benoit said numerous times that he originally hated the mask, but it eventually became a part of him. While with NJPW, he came into his own as a performer in critically acclaimed matches with luminaries like [[Jushin Thunder Liger]], [[Shinjiro Otani]], [[Eddie Guerrero|Black Tiger]], and [[El Samurai]] in their junior heavyweight division.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nIn August 1990, he won his first major championship, the [[IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship]], from Jushin Thunder Liger. He eventually lost the title in November 1990 (and in July 1991 in Japan and in November 1991 in Mexico, his [[Luchas de Apuestas|mask]]) back to Liger,<ref name=\"Titles\"/> forcing him to reinvent himself as Wild Pegasus. Benoit spent the next couple years in Japan, winning the [[Best of the Super Juniors]] tournament twice in [[Best of the Super Juniors#1993|1993]] and [[Best of the Super Juniors#1995|1995]]. He went on to win the [[Super J-Cup (1994)|inaugural]] [[Super J-Cup|Super J-Cup tournament]] in 1994, defeating Black Tiger, [[Gedo (wrestler)|Gedo]], and [[The Great Sasuke]] in the finals. He wrestled outside New Japan occasionally to compete in Mexico and Europe, where he won a few regional championships, including the [[WWF Light Heavyweight Championship]]. He held that title for over a year, having many forty-plus minute matches with [[Villano III]].{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\n=== World Championship Wrestling (1992\u20131993) ===\nBenoit first came to [[World Championship Wrestling]] in June 1992, teaming up with fellow Canadian wrestler [[Biff Wellington]] for the [[NWA World Tag Team Championship]] tournament; they were defeated by [[Brian Pillman]] and Jushin Thunder Liger in the first round at [[Clash of the Champions XIX]].\n\nHe did not return to WCW until January 1993 at ''[[Clash of the Champions XXII]]'', defeating [[Brad Armstrong (wrestler)|Brad Armstrong]]. A month later, at [[SuperBrawl III]], he lost to [[2 Cold Scorpio]], getting pinned with only three seconds left in the 20-minute time limit. At the same time, he formed a tag team with [[Bobby Eaton]]. After he and Eaton lost to Scorpio and [[Marcus Bagwell]] at [[Slamboree (1993)|Slamboree]], Benoit headed back to Japan.\n\n=== Extreme Championship Wrestling (1994\u20131995) ===\nIn 1994, Benoit began working with [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]] (ECW) in between tours of Japan. He was booked as a dominant wrestler there, gaining notoriety as the \"Crippler\" after he put [[Rocco Rock]] out. In August 1994, Benoit competed in a [[NWA World Title Tournament|one-night eight-man tournament]] for the vacant [[NWA World Heavyweight Championship]], losing to [[2 Cold Scorpio]] in the quarter-finals.<ref name=\"Williams2013\">{{cite book |author=Scott E.

The injury came when Benoit threw Sabu with the intention that he take a face-first \"pancake\" [[Bump (professional wrestling)|bump]], but Sabu attempted to turn mid-air and take a backdrop bump instead. He did not achieve full rotation and landed almost directly on his neck.<ref name=\"hell162163\">{{cite book |title=Ring of Hell: The Story of Chris Benoit & The Fall of the Pro Wrestling Industry |last=Randazzo V |first=Matthew |publisher=Phoenix Books |pages=[https://archive.org/details/ringofhellstoryo0000rand/page/162 162\u2013163] |year=2008 |isbn=978-1-59777-622-6 |url=https://archive.org/details/ringofhellstoryo0000rand/page/162}}</ref>\n\nAfter this match Benoit returned to the locker room and broke down over the possibility that he might have paralysed someone.<ref name=\"hell162163\"/> [[Paul Heyman]], the head booker of ECW at the time, came up with the idea of continuing the \"Crippler\" moniker for Benoit. From that point until his departure from ECW, he was known as \"Crippler Benoit\". When he returned to WCW in October 1995, WCW modified his ring name to \"Canadian Crippler Chris Benoit\". In ''The Rise and Fall of ECW'' book, Heyman commented that he planned on using Benoit as a dominant heel for quite some time, before putting the company's main title, the [[ECW World Heavyweight Championship]], on him to be the long-term champion of the company.\n\nBenoit and [[Dean Malenko]] won the [[ECW World Tag Team Championship]] from Sabu and [[Tazz|The Tazmaniac]] in February 1995, Benoit's first American title.<ref name=\"Titles\"/> After winning, they were initiated into the [[The Triple Threat|Triple Threat]] [[List of professional wrestling terms#S|stable]], led by ECW World Heavyweight Champion, [[Shane Douglas]], as Douglas's attempt to recreate the [[Four Horsemen (professional wrestling)|Four Horsemen]], as the three-man contingency held all three of the ECW championships at the time (Malenko also held the [[ECW World Television Championship]] at the time). The team lost the championship to [[The Public Enemy (professional wrestling)|The Public Enemy]] that April at ECW Three Way Dance. Benoit spent some time in ECW feuding with [[The Steiner Brothers]] and rekindling the feud with 2 Cold Scorpio. He was forced to leave ECW after his work visa expired; Heyman was supposed to renew it, but he failed to make it on time, so Benoit left as a matter of job security and the ability to enter the United States. He toured Japan until WCW called.<ref name=\"Titles\"/>\n\n=== Return to WCW ===\n====The Four Horsemen (1995&ndash;1999)====\n[[New Japan Pro-Wrestling]] and [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW) had a working relationship, and because of their \"talent exchange\" program, Benoit signed with WCW in late 1995 along with a number of talent working in New Japan to be a part of the [[List of professional wrestling terms#A|angle]]. Like the majority of those who came to WCW in the exchange, he started out in as a member of the [[cruiserweight (professional wrestling)|cruiserweight]] division, having lengthy matches against many of his former rivals in Japan on almost every single broadcast. At the end of 1995, Benoit went back to Japan as a part of the \"talent exchange\" to wrestle as a representative for New Japan in the [[Super J-Cup#1995|Super J-Cup: 2nd Stage]], defeating [[Chris Jericho|Lionheart]] in the quarterfinals (he received a bye to the quarterfinals for his work in 1995, similar to the way he advanced in the 1994 edition) and losing to [[Keiji Takayama|Gedo]] in the semifinals.\n\n[[File:Lisa and Chris Benoit.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1|Benoit with a fan during his time in WCW]]\nAfter impressing higher-ups with his work, he was approached by [[Ric Flair]] and the WCW booking staff to become a member of the reformed [[Four Horsemen (professional wrestling)|Four Horsemen]] in 1995, alongside Flair, [[Arn Anderson]], and [[Brian Pillman]]; he was introduced by Pillman as a gruff, no-nonsense heel similar to his ECW persona, \"The Crippler\". He was brought in to add a new dynamic for Anderson and Flair's tormenting of [[Hulk Hogan]] and [[Randy Savage]] in their \"Alliance to End Hulkamania\", which saw the Horsemen team up with [[The Dungeon of Doom]], but that alliance ended with Dungeon leader and WCW [[List of professional wrestling terms#B|booker]], [[Kevin Sullivan (wrestler)|Kevin Sullivan]] feuding with Pillman. When Pillman abruptly left the company for the WWF, Benoit was placed into his ongoing feud with Sullivan. This came to fruition through a dissension between the two in a tag team match with the two reluctantly teaming with each other against [[The Public Enemy (professional wrestling)|The Public Enemy]], and Benoit being attacked by Sullivan at [[Slamboree 1996|Slamboree]]. This led to the two having violent confrontations at [[pay-per-view]]s, which led to Sullivan booking a feud in which Benoit was having an [[affair]] with Sullivan's real life wife and [[Kayfabe|onscreen]] [[List of professional wrestling terms#V|valet]], [[Nancy Benoit|Nancy]] (also known as Woman). Benoit and Nancy were forced to spend time together to make the affair look real, (hold hands in public, share hotel rooms, etc.).<ref>[http://www.metafilter.com/62384/Chris-Benoit-19672007 Chris Benoit (1967\u20132007) profile], MetaFilter.com; accessed June 30, 2015.</ref>\n\nThis onscreen relationship developed into a real-life affair offscreen. As a result, Sullivan and Benoit had a contentious backstage relationship at best. Benoit did, however, admit having a certain amount of respect for Sullivan, saying on the DVD ''[[Hard Knocks: The Chris Benoit Story]]'' that Sullivan never took undue liberties in the ring during their feud, even though he blamed Benoit for breaking up his marriage. This continued for over the course of a year with Sullivan having his [[enforcer (professional wrestling)|enforcers]] apprehend Benoit in a multitude of matches. This culminated in a [[retirement match]] at the [[Bash at the Beach 1997|Bash at the Beach]], where Benoit defeated Sullivan; this was used to explain Sullivan going to a behind-the-scenes role, where he could focus on his initial job of booking.\n\nIn 1998, Benoit had a long feud with [[Booker T (wrestler)|Booker T]]. They fought over the [[WCW World Television Championship]] until Booker lost the title to [[Dave Finlay|Fit Finlay]].<ref name=\"Titles\"/> Booker won a \"Best-of-Seven\" series which was held between the two to determine a number one contender. Benoit went up 3 to 1 before Booker caught up, forcing the 7th and final match on [[WCW Monday Nitro|''Monday Nitro'']]. During the match, [[Bret Hart]] interjected himself, interfering on behalf of Benoit in an attempt to get him to join the [[New World Order (professional wrestling)|New World Order]]. Benoit refused to win that way and told the referee what happened, getting himself disqualified. Booker refused that victory, instead opting for an eighth match at the [[Great American Bash 1998|Great American Bash]] to see who would fight Finlay later that night. Booker won the final match and went on to beat Finlay for the title.<ref name=\"Titles\"/> This feud significantly elevated both men's careers as singles competitors, and both remained at the top of the midcard afterward.\n\nIn 1999, Benoit teamed with Dean Malenko once again and defeated [[Curt Hennig]] and [[Barry Windham]] to win the [[WCW World Tag Team Championship]].<ref name=\"Titles\"/> This led to a reformation of the Four Horsemen with the tag team champions, Anderson, and [[Steve McMichael|Steve \"Mongo\" McMichael]]. The two hunted after the tag team championship for several months, feuding with teams like [[Raven (wrestler)|Raven]] and [[Perry Saturn]] or [[Billy Kidman]] and [[Rey Mysterio, Jr.]] \n\n====The Revolution and World Heavyweight Champion (1999&ndash;2000)====\nAfter a falling out with Anderson and McMichael, Benoit and Malenko left the Horsemen; he won the [[WWE United States Championship|WCW United States Heavyweight Championship]]<ref name=\"Titles\"/> before bringing together Malenko, Perry Saturn, and [[Shane Douglas]] to form \"[[Revolution (professional wrestling)|The Revolution]]\".\n\nThe Revolution was a heel stable of younger wrestlers who felt slighted (both kayfabe and legitimate) by WCW management, believing they never gave them the chance to be stars, [[Push (professional wrestling)|pushing]] older, more established wrestlers instead, despite their then-current questionable worthiness of their pushes. This led to the Revolution seceding from WCW, and forming their own nation, complete with a flag. This led to some friction being created between Benoit and leader, Douglas, who called into question Benoit's heart in the group, causing Benoit to quit the group, thus turning face, and having his own crusade against the top stars, winning the Television title one more time and the United States title from [[Jeff Jarrett]] in a [[ladder match]]. In October 1999 on ''Nitro'' in [[Kansas City, Missouri]], Benoit wrestled Bret Hart as a tribute to [[Owen Hart]], who had recently died due to an [[Over the Edge (1999)#Owen Hart accident|equipment malfunction]]. Hart defeated Benoit by submission, and the two received a standing ovation, and an embrace from guest ring announcer, [[Harley Race]].\n\nBenoit was unhappy working for WCW.<ref name=\"unhappy\">{{cite web |url=http://slam.canoe.com/SlamWrestlingArchive/apr17_ring.html |title=Ring of intrigue in WWF shows |last=Cole |first=Glenn |date=April 17, 1999 |work=SLAM!

After losing their \"tryout matches\" upon entry, The Radicalz aligned themselves with WWF Champion [[Triple H]] and became a [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]] [[glossary of professional wrestling terms#Faction|faction]]. Benoit quickly won his first title in the WWF just over a month later at [[WrestleMania 2000]], pinning [[Chris Jericho]] in a triple threat match to win [[Kurt Angle]]'s [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|Intercontinental Championship]]. It was also in this time period that Benoit wrestled in his first WWF pay-per-view main events, challenging [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]] for the [[WWE Championship|WWF Championship]] at [[Fully Loaded (2000)|Fully Loaded]] in July and as part of a fatal four way title match at [[Unforgiven (2000)|Unforgiven]] in September. On both occasions Benoit appeared to have won the title, only to have the decision reversed by then-WWF [[Professional wrestling authority figures|commissioner]] [[Mick Foley]] due to cheating on Benoit's part. Benoit simultaneously entered into a long-running feud with Jericho for the Intercontinental title, with the two meeting at [[Backlash (2000)|Backlash]], [[Judgment Day (2000)|Judgment Day]] and [[SummerSlam (2000)|SummerSlam]]; Benoit winning all three matches. The feud finally culminated in Jericho defeating Benoit in a [[ladder match]] at the [[Royal Rumble (2001)|Royal Rumble]] in January 2001. Benoit won the Intercontinental title three times between April 2000 and January 2001.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nIn early 2001, Benoit broke away from The Radicalz (who had recently reformed three months earlier) and turned face, feuding first with his former stablemates and then with Kurt Angle, whom he wrestled and lost to at [[WrestleMania X-Seven]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.otherarena.com/htm/cgi-bin/history.cgi?2001/wwf040101 |title=WrestleMania X-Seven report |accessdate=February 9, 2008 |publisher=The Other Arena |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080404173136/http://www.otherarena.com/htm/cgi-bin/history.cgi?2001%2Fwwf040101 |archivedate=April 4, 2008 |url-status=dead |df=}}</ref> He gained some amount of revenge after beating Angle in a \"Ultimiate Submission\" match at [[Backlash (2001)|Backlash]]. The feud continued after Benoit stole Angle's cherished [[Gold medal|Olympic Gold Medal]]. This culminated in a match at [[Judgment Day (2001)|Judgment Day]] where Angle won a [[Professional wrestling match types#Series variations|two out of three falls match]] with the help of [[Edge and Christian]]. In response, Benoit teamed up with his former rival Jericho to defeat Edge and Christian in that night's [[professional wrestling tag team match types#Tag Team Turmoil|Tag Team Turmoil match]].\n\nThe next night on ''[[WWE Raw|Raw Is War]]'', Benoit and Jericho defeated [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|WWF Tag Team Champions]] [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]] and Triple H for their title. The pair used the win as a springboard to challenge Austin for his WWF Championship. Benoit got two title matches the following week, first losing in a manner similar to the [[Montreal Screwjob]] in Calgary and then losing in a close match in Benoit's hometown of Edmonton. However, Benoit suffered a neck injury in a four-way [[Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match|TLC match]] that required surgery with [[Lloyd Youngblood|Dr. Lloyd Youngblood]]. Despite this, he continued to wrestle until the [[King of the Ring (2001)|King of the Ring]], where he was pinned in a triple threat match versus Austin and Jericho.

The structure supports and is suited to assist long- term planning and strategic decision-making.<ref name=\":5\" /> At the beginning of the process key background information is assembled to increase the amount of knowledge and understanding each individual decision maker has about the topic, vital aspects of information will also be included. The research and information founded is put into a mutual location to provide equal grounds in terms of knowledge before a discussion occurs, this give time for questions to be established.

The purpose of the summary is to clearly outline key factors that are most relevant to the specified topic.\n# The results and findings from the analysis are discussed among decision makers, as a group, in order to ensure that the best possible outcome can be made strategically.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|url = http://ncbermudaafg.org/Assembly/Spring%202013/NC-BDA%20STEPS%20OF%20KBDM%202013.pdf|title = The Steps of Knowledge Based Decision Making|last = Anon|first = Anon|date = n.d.|journal = Making an Informed Decision|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 1 November 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Purpose==\n* The KBDM process allows the main focus and emphasis to be on the actual decision and reasoning, not the people who make the decision, so authority is not a major factor.<ref name=\":3\" />\n* KBDM is considered a process.  Within processes there are structures in place, structures can allow methodical approaches to occur and therefore indicates a starting point when making vital decisions. From this KBDM to be used as an indicator and standard guideline in which can be applied to decision- making situations.<ref name=\":4\" />\n* During the beginning of the process relevant information is gathered so that overall decision can be based on background information and factual knowledge.<ref name=\":1\" /> By researching background information it can assist the focus levels in the topic particular area. The structure present enables the thought process of a decision to be specified and states the reasons behind a decision,<ref name=\":3\" /> so if an issue does occur with the overall outcome the thought process can be evaluated thoroughly.    \n* In association with business, the KBDM process can give companies or organisations a competitive advantage, create common grounds and gain understanding of others within the same sector due to the structured format. The structure supports and is suited to assist long- term planning and strategic decision-making.<ref name=\":5\" /> At the beginning of the process key background information is assembled to increase the amount of knowledge and understanding each individual decision maker has about the topic, vital aspects of information will also be included. The research and information founded is put into a mutual location to provide equal grounds in terms of knowledge before a discussion occurs, this give time for questions to be established. From the KBDM process a decision can be made based on facts, understanding and suitable reasoning from discussions to conclude the most appropriate decision.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n==Questions==\nDuring the third stage of the process background information is measured against a set of questions. These questions are answered and then used to contribute to the overall decision made.\n\nQuestions that are used to measure information include:\n# What do we currently know about the needs, wants and preferences of our members that relates to this discussion?\n# What do we know about both our resources and strategic position that is relevant to this issue?\n# What do we know about the current environment and culture that relates to this issue?\n# What are the (ethical) implications of our choice (pros and cons)?<ref>{{Cite journal|url = http://www.pa-al-anon.org/service/KnowledgeBasedDecisionMakingSummary.pdf|title = Knowledge based decision making - questions|last = Anon|first = Anon|date = n.d.|journal = Pa-al-anon|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}</ref>\n# What do we not know about this issue that we wish we knew?<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite journal|url = http://www.scws-al-anon.org/director_presentations/KBDM_IntroandRefresher_wNotes_021514.pdf|title = KBDM|last = Al- Anon|first = SCWS|date = n.d.|journal = KBDM|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 18 October 2015}}</ref>\n# How do Al-Anon's legacies apply to this issue?\n# What is your part in the process?<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|title = Knowledge Based Decision Making Overview|last = http://www.al-anon12.org/uploads/3/7/6/8/37680853/knowledgebaseddecisionmaking.pdf|first = Al-Anon|date = January 2012|journal = Al-Anon District 12 Panel 52|doi = |pmid = }}</ref>\n\n== Decision making in project management ==\nEffective [[project management]] is best achieved using an adaptive approach focused on effective decision-making.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=O\u2019Sullivan|first=David|date=2015-06-24|title=Decision making in project management|journal=Production Planning & Control|language=en|volume=26|issue=16|pages=1386\u20131387|doi=10.1080/09537287.2015.1055092|issn=0953-7287}}</ref> Therefore, a variety of tools based on [[Knowledge management software|software]] and [[Organizational structure|structure]] have been developed to support decision making in groups.\nDecision Making processes are strongly correlating to the level of available knowledge regarding the environment, the decision\nis based on.<ref>Holsapple, C.
