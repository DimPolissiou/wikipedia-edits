It deals with reminiscence upon youth and romantic idealism.\n\n[[Mary Hopkin]]'s 1968 debut single of \"Those Were the Days\", which was produced by [[Paul McCartney]] of [[the Beatles]], became a number one hit on the [[UK Singles Chart]]. The song also reached number two on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], behind \"[[Hey Jude]]\" by the Beatles.

[[Mary Hopkin]]'s 1968 recording of it with Gene Raskin's lyric was a chart-topping hit in much of the Northern Hemisphere. On most recordings of the song, Raskin is credited as the sole writer, even though he wrote only the later English lyrics (which are not an English translation of the Russian lyrics) and not the music.\n\n==Later history==\nIn the early 1960s Raskin, with his wife Francesca, played folk music around [[Greenwich Village]] in New York, including [[White Horse Tavern (New York City)|White Horse Tavern]].

In the United States, Hopkin's recording reached number two on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] (held out of the top spot for three weeks by \"[[Hey Jude]]\" by [[The Beatles]]) and topped the Billboard [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|Easy Listening]] charts for six weeks.<ref>{{cite book|first= Joel |last= Whitburn |authorlink= Joel Whitburn |title= Top Adult Contemporary: 1961-2001 |year= 2002 |publisher= Record Research |page= 118}}</ref> In the Netherlands, it topped the charts for two consecutive weeks.<ref name=\"NL\"/> The Russian origin of the melody was accentuated by an instrumentation that was unusual for a top-ten pop record, including [[balalaika]], [[clarinet]], [[hammered dulcimer]] or [[cimbalom]], [[tenor banjo]] and children's chorus, giving a [[klezmer]] feel to the song. Mary Hopkin played acoustic guitar on the recording, and [[Paul McCartney]] also played acoustic guitar and possibly percussion. The cimbalom was played by Gilbert Webster.<ref>{{cite book|first= Kristofer |last= Engelhardt |year= 2010 |title= Beatles Deeper Undercover |page= 147 |publisher= Collector's Guide Publishing, Incorporated |isbn= 978-1-926-59209-1}}</ref> The player of the banjo is not recorded, although McCartney was known to occasionally play banjo.\n\nMcCartney also recorded Hopkin singing \"Those Were The Days\" in other languages for release in their respective countries:\n*In [[Spain]], ''Qu\u00e9 tiempo tan feliz''\n*In [[West Germany]], ''An jenem Tag''\n*In [[Italy]], ''Quelli erano giorni''\n*In [[France]], ''Le temps des fleurs''\n*in Afghanistan, Digar Ashkam Marez\n\nThe non-English sets of lyrics were also recorded by [[Dalida]] and [[Sandie Shaw]], with Shaw recording the English lyrics as well.\n\nThe UK and United States recording's B-side was [[Pete Seeger]]'s \"[[Turn!

Shaw's version was released as a single, but did not match the success of Hopkin's version.\n\nAt the peak of the song's success, a New York company used the melody in a commercial for Rokeach [[gefilte fish]], arguing that the tune was an old Russian folk-tune and thus in the public domain. (The commercial included the line \"The perfect dish, Rokeach Gefilte Fish\" where the English-language song would go \"Those were the days, oh yes, those were the days.\") Raskin successfully sued and won a settlement, since he had slightly altered the tune to fit his lyrics and had taken out the valid new copyright.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\nIn the mid-1970s, after Hopkin's contract with Apple ended, \"Those Were the Days\" and \"Goodbye\" were re-recorded with producer [[Tony Visconti]], whom she had married in 1971. These re-recorded versions can be found on music compilations.\n\nOn 25 October 2010, Apple Records released ''[[Come and Get It: The Best of Apple Records]]'', which included the original recordings of \"Those Were the Days\" and \"Goodbye\".

Shaw's version was released as a single, but did not match the success of Hopkin's version.\n\nAt the peak of the song's success, a New York company used the melody in a commercial for Rokeach [[gefilte fish]], arguing that the tune was an old Russian folk-tune and thus in the public domain. (The commercial included the line \"The perfect dish, Rokeach Gefilte Fish\" where the English-language song would go \"Those were the days, oh yes, those were the days.\") Raskin successfully sued and won a settlement, since he had slightly altered the tune to fit his lyrics and had taken out the valid new copyright.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\nIn the mid-1970s, after Hopkin's contract with Apple ended, \"Those Were the Days\" and \"Goodbye\" were re-recorded with producer [[Tony Visconti]], whom she had married in 1971.

In historical context, such proposals were better described as liberalised [[centrally-planned economy]] rather than the socially-sensitive capitalism that Third Way policies tend to have been identified with in the West. In the 1970s and 1980s, [[Enrico Berlinguer]], leader of the [[Italian Communist Party]], came to advocate a vision of a socialist society that was more pluralist than the [[real socialism]] which was typically advocated by [[official communist]] parties whilst being more economically egalitarian than social democracy.

In historical context, such proposals were better described as liberalised [[centrally-planned economy]] rather than the socially-sensitive capitalism that Third Way policies tend to have been identified with in the West. In the 1970s and 1980s, [[Enrico Berlinguer]], leader of the [[Italian Communist Party]], came to advocate a vision of a socialist society that was more pluralist than the [[real socialism]] which was typically advocated by [[official communist]] parties whilst being more economically egalitarian than social democracy.

The Third Way is in favour of growth, entrepreneurship, enterprise and wealth creation but it is also in favour of greater social justice and it sees the state playing a major role in bringing this about.

Keating also proposed a [[Goods and Services Tax (Australia)|Goods and Services Tax]] (GST) in 1985, but this was scrapped due to its unpopularity amongst both ALP and electorate.

Everyone was supposed to receive the same public services (schools, hospitals, prisons, etc.), but with separate facilities for each race. In practice, the services and facilities reserved for African-Americans were almost always of lower quality than those reserved for whites, if they existed at all; for example, most [[African-American schools]] received less public funding per student than nearby white schools. Segregation was never mandated by law in the Northern states, but a ''de facto'' system grew for schools, in which nearly all black students attended schools that were nearly all-black. In the South, white schools had only white pupils and teachers, while black schools had only black teachers and black students.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.aft.org/periodical/american-educator/summer-2004/jim-crows-schools|title=Jim Crow's Schools|date=2014-08-08|work=American Federation of Teachers|access-date=2018-05-29|language=en}}</ref>\n\nSome [[streetcar]] companies did not segregate voluntarily.

Exposure is the likelihood that a minority and a majority party will come in contact with one another. Clustering is the gathering of different minority groups into a single space; clustering often leads to one big [[ghetto]] and the formation of hyperghettoization. Centralization measures the tendency of members of a minority group to be located in the middle of an urban area, often computed as a percentage of a minority group living in the middle of a city (as opposed to the outlying areas). Concentration is the dimension that relates to the actual amount of land a minority lives on within its particular city. The higher segregation is within that particular area, the smaller the amount of land a minority group will control.\n\nThe pattern of hypersegregation began in the early 20th century. African-Americans who moved to large cities often moved into the inner-city in order to gain industrial jobs. The influx of new African-American residents caused many European American residents to move to the suburbs in a case of [[white flight]]. As industry began to move out of the inner-city, the African-American residents lost the stable jobs that had brought them to the area. Many were unable to leave the inner-city, however, and they became increasingly poor.<ref name=\"Hurst\">{{Cite book| author = Charles E.

The United States government began making low-interest mortgages available to families through the [[Federal Housing Administration]] (FHA) and the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Veteran's Administration]]. Black families were legally entitled to these loans but were sometimes denied these loans because the planners behind this initiative labeled many black neighborhoods throughout the country as \"in decline\". The rules for loans did not say that \"black families cannot get loans\"; rather, they said people from \"areas in decline\" could not get loans.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://fortune.com/2016/06/02/banks-lending-minorities/|title=Here's Why Big Banks Are Lending to Fewer Blacks and Hispanics|work=Fortune|access-date=2018-05-29|language=en}}</ref> While a case could be made that the wording did not appear to compel segregation, it tended to have that effect.{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}} In fact, this administration was formed as part of the [[New Deal]] to all Americans and mostly affected black residents of inner city areas; most black families did in fact live in the [[inner city]] areas of large cities and almost entirely occupied these areas after the end of World War II when whites began to move to new suburbs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.stanford.edu/class/e297c/poverty_prejudice/soc_sec/hgreat.htm|title=The Great Depression and the New Deal|website=web.stanford.edu|access-date=2018-05-29}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to encouraging white families to move to suburbs by providing them loans to do so, the government uprooted many established African American communities by building elevated highways through their neighborhoods.

Parks' civil disobedience had the effect of sparking the [[Montgomery Bus Boycott]]. Parks' act of defiance became an important symbol of the modern [[Civil Rights Movement]] and Parks became an international icon of resistance to racial segregation. \n[[File:1943 Colored Waiting Room Sign.jpg|thumb|Sign for \"colored\" waiting room at a [[Greyhound Lines|Greyhound]] bus terminal in [[Rome, Georgia]], 1943.]]\n\nSegregation was also pervasive in housing. State constitutions (for example, that of [[California Constitution|California]]) had clauses giving local jurisdictions the right to regulate where members of certain races could live. In 1917, the Supreme Court in the case of ''[[Buchanan v. Warley]]'' declared municipal resident segregation [[Local ordinance|ordinances]] unconstitutional. In response, whites resorted to the [[restrictive covenant]], a formal deed restriction binding white property owners in a given neighborhood not to sell to blacks.

Kraemer]]'', the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] finally ruled that such covenants were unenforceable in a court of law. However, residential segregation patterns had already become established in most American cities, and have often persisted up to the present (see [[white flight]] and [[Redlining]]).\n\nIn most cities, the only way blacks could relieve the pressure of crowding that resulted from increasing migration was to expand residential borders into surrounding previously white neighborhoods, a process that often resulted in harassment and attacks by white residents whose intolerant attitudes were intensified by fears that black neighbors would cause property values to decline. Moreover, the increased presence of African Americans in cities, North and South, as well as their competition with whites for housing, jobs, and political influence sparked a series of race riots. In 1898 white citizens of Wilmington, North Carolina, resenting African Americans' involvement in local government and incensed by an editorial in an African-American newspaper accusing white women of loose sexual behavior, rioted and killed dozens of blacks. In the fury's wake, white supremacists overthrew the city government, expelling black and white office holders, and instituted restrictions to prevent blacks from voting. In Atlanta in 1906, newspaper accounts alleging attacks by black men on white women provoked an outburst of shooting and killing that left twelve blacks dead and seventy injured. An influx of unskilled black strikebreakers into [[East St Louis, Illinois]], heightened racial tensions in 1917. Rumors that blacks were arming themselves for an attack on whites resulted in numerous attacks by white mobs on black neighborhoods. On July 1, blacks fired back at a car whose occupants they believed had shot into their homes and mistakenly killed two policemen riding in a car. The next day, a full scaled riot erupted which ended only after nine whites and thirty-nine blacks had been killed and over three hundred buildings were destroyed.\n\nWith the migration to the North of many black workers at the turn of the 20th century, and the friction that occurred between white and black workers during this time, segregation was and continues to be a phenomenon in northern cities as well as in the South. Whites generally allocate [[tenements]] as housing to the poorest blacks. It would be well to remember, though, that while racism had to be legislated out of the South, many in the North, including [[Religious Society of Friends|Quakers]] and others who ran the [[Underground Railroad]], were ideologically opposed to Southerners' treatment of blacks. By the same token, many white Southerners have a claim to closer relationships with blacks than wealthy northern whites, regardless of the latter's stated political persuasion.<ref>[http://www.skidmore.edu/~dkarp/Social%20Issues/E/history.html History of Residential Segregation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041114125050/http://www.skidmore.edu/~dkarp/Social%20Issues/E/history.html |date=November 14, 2004 }}</ref>\n\n[[Anti-miscegenation laws]] (also known as miscegenation laws) prohibited whites and non-whites from marrying each other.

This phenomenon is due to [[white flight]] where whites actively leave neighborhoods often because of a black presence. There are more than just geographical consequences to this, as the money leaves and poverty grows, crime rates jump and businesses leave and follow the money. This creates a job shortage in segregated neighborhoods and perpetuates the economic inequality in the inner city. With the wealth and businesses gone from inner city areas, the tax base decreases, which hurts funding for education. Consequently, those that can afford to leave the area for better schools leave decreasing the tax base for educational funding even more. Any business that is left or would consider opening doesn't want to invest in a place nobody has any money but has a lot of crime, meaning the only things that are left in these communities are poor black people with little opportunity for employment or education.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Newman |first=Katherine |title=No Shame in My Game: The Working Poor in the Inner City |url=https://archive.org/details/noshameinmygamew00newm |url-access=registration |location=New York |publisher=Knopf |year=1999 |isbn=978-0-375-40254-8 }}</ref>\n\nToday, a number of whites are willing, and are able, to pay a premium to live in a predominantly white neighborhood.

In Washington, D.C., 94 percent of children were black or Hispanic; less than 5 percent were white.\n\n[[Jonathan Kozol]] expanded on this topic in his book ''[[The Shame of the Nation]]: The Restoration of Apartheid Schooling in America.''\n\nThe \"New American apartheid\" refers to the allegation that US drug and criminal policies in practice target blacks on the basis of race. The radical left-wing web-magazine [[ZNet]] featured a series of 4 articles on \"The New American Apartheid\" in which it drew parallels between the treatment of blacks by the American justice system and apartheid:\n\n<blockquote>Modern prisoners occupy the lowest rungs on the social class ladder, and they always have. The modern prison system (along with local jails) is a collection of ghettos or poorhouses reserved primarily for the unskilled, the uneducated, and the powerless. In increasing numbers this system is being reserved for racial minorities, especially blacks, which is why we are calling it the New American Apartheid. This is the same segment of American society that has experienced some of the most drastic reductions in income and they have been targeted for their involvement in drugs and the subsequent violence that extends from the lack of legitimate means of goal attainment.<ref>Shelden, Randall G.\nand William B. Brown.

This serves the purpose of making students of color more comfortable and highlighting the challenges they face on historically white-dominated campuses, although it may impair the ability of such students to interact with people outside of their specific group.<ref>{{cite web\n | url =https://www.nas.org/reports/separate-but-equal-again\n | title =Separate but Equal, Again\n | last =Pierre\n | first =Dion\n | date =29 April 2019\n | website =National Association of Scholars\n | access-date =28 June 2019 }}</ref>\n\nDue to education being funded primarily through local and state revenue, the quality of education varies greatly depending on the geographical location of the school. In some areas, education is primarily funded through revenue from property taxes; therefore, there is a direct correlation in some areas between the price of homes and the amount of money allocated to educating the area's youth.<ref name=\"autogenerated2004\">Massey, Douglas S. 2004. \"The New Geography of Inequality in Urban America,\" in C. Michael Henry, ed. Race, Poverty, and Domestic Policy. New Haven: Yale University Press.</ref> A 2010 US Census showed that 27.4% of all African-Americans lived under the poverty line, the highest percentage of any other ethnic group in the United States.<ref>Income, Poverty and Health Insurance Coverage in the United States: 2010\". U.S. Census Bureau</ref> Therefore, in predominantly African-American areas, otherwise known as 'ghettos', the amount of money available for education is extremely low. This is referred to as \"funding segregation\".<ref name=\"autogenerated2004\"/> This questionable system of educational funding can be seen as one of the primary reasons contemporary racial segregation continues to prosper. Predominantly Caucasian areas with more money funneled into primary and secondary educational institutions, allow their students the resources to succeed academically and obtain post-secondary degrees. This practice continues to ethnically, socially and economically divide America.\n\nAlternative certificate programs were introduced in many inner-city schools and rural areas. These programs award a person a teaching license even though he/she has not completed a traditional teaching degree. This program came into effect in the 1980s throughout most states in response to the dwindling number of people seeking to earn a secondary degree in education.<ref>Feistritzer, Emily (February 1, 2006). \"Alternative Teacher Certification\". National Center for Alternative Certification</ref> This program has been very controversial. It is, \"booming despite little more than anecdotal evidence of their success.[\u2026] there are concerns about how they will perform as teachers, especially since they are more likely to end up in poor districts teaching students in challenging situations.\"<ref>{{cite news |author1=Morgan Smith  |author2=Nick Pandolfo  |lastauthoramp=yes |title=For-Profit Certification for Teachers is Booming |newspaper= The New York Times |date=November 26, 2011 |accessdate= November 4, 2012 |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/27/us/for-profit-certification-for-teachers-in-texas-is-booming.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0}}</ref> Alternative Certificate graduates tend to teach African-Americans and other ethnic minorities in inner-city schools and schools in impoverished small rural towns. Therefore, impoverished minorities not only have to cope with having the smallest amount of resources for their educational facilities but also with having the least trained teachers in the nation. Valorie Delp, a mother residing in an inner-city area whose child attends a school taught by teachers awarded by an alternative certificate program notes:\n\n<blockquote>One teacher we know who is in this program said he had visions of coming in to \"save\" the kids and the school and he really believes that this idea was kind of stoked in his program. No one ever says that you may have kids who threaten to stab you, or call you unspeakable names to your face, or can't read despite being in 7th grade.<ref>{{cite web|author=Valorie Delp |title=My Inner City Story: Why Alternative Certification Programs Don't Work, Parenting Education |accessdate= November 4, 2012 |url= http://education.families.com/blog/my-inner-city-story-how-alternative-teacher-certification-programs-do-a-disservice-to-the-inner-city}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nDelp showcases that, while many graduates of these certificate programs have honorable intentions and are educated, intelligent people, there is a reason why teachers have traditionally had to take a significant amount of training before officially being certified as a teacher. The experience they gain through their practicum and extensive classroom experience equips them with the tools necessary to educate today's youth.\n\nSome measures have been taken to try give less affluent families the ability to educate their children. President [[Ronald Reagan]] introduced the McKinney\u2013Vento Homeless Assistance Act on July 22, 1987.<ref>Department of Education, Office of Elementary and Secondary Education, \"McKinney-Vento Education for Homeless Children and Youths Program: Notice of school enrollment guidelines\"</ref> This Act was meant to allow children the ability to succeed if their families did not have a permanent residence. Leo Stagman, a single, African-American parent, located in Berkeley, California, whose daughter had received a great deal of aid from the Act wrote on October 20, 2012 that, \"During her education, she [Leo's daughter] was eligible for the free lunch program and received assistance under the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Educational Act. I know my daughter's performance is hers, but I wonder where she would have been without the assistance she received under the McKinney-Vento Act. Many students at BHS owe their graduation and success to the assistance under this law.\"<ref name=\"sfbayview1\">{{cite news |first=Leo |last=Stagman |title=Racism and classism in Berkeley streets and schools |publisher=San Francisco Bay View National Black Newspaper |date=October 24, 2012 |accessdate= November 4, 2012 |url=http://sfbayview.com/2012/racism-and-classism-in-berkeley-streets-and-schools/}}</ref>\n\nLeo then goes on to note that, \"the majority of the students receiving assistance under the act are Black and Brown.\"<ref name=\"sfbayview1\"/> There have been various other Acts enacted to try and aid impoverished youth with the chance to succeed. One of these Acts includes the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (NCLB). This Act was meant to increase the accountability of public schools and their teachers by creating standardized testing which would give an overview of the success of the school's ability to educate their students.<ref name=\"reauthorization1\">{{cite web |title=ELEMENTARY & SECONDARY EDUCATION: A Blueprint for Reform: The Reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act |publisher= US Department of Education |url=http://www2.ed.gov/policy/elsec/leg/blueprint/publication_pg7.html#part7|date= 2011-05-27 }}</ref> Schools which repeatedly performed poorly would have increased attention and assistance from the federal government.<ref name=\"reauthorization1\"/> One of the intended outcomes of the Act was to narrow the class and racial [[achievement gap in the United States]] by instituting common expectations for all students.<ref name=\"reauthorization1\"/> Test scores have shown to be improving for minority populations, however, they are improving at the same rate for Caucasian children as well. This Act therefore, has done little to close the educational gap between Caucasian and minority children.<ref>\"Charting the Course: States Decide Major Provisions Under No Child Left Behind.\" U.S. Department of Education.</ref>\n\nThere has also been an issue with minority populations becoming educated because to a fear of being accused of \"Acting White\". It is a hard definition to pin down, however, this is a negative term predominantly used by African-Americans that showing interest in one's studies is a betrayal of the African-American culture as one is trying to be a part of white society rather than staying true to his/her roots. Roland G. Fryer, Jr., at Harvard University has noted that, \"There is necessarily a trade-off between doing well and rejection by your peers when you come from a traditionally low-achieving group, especially when that group comes into contact with more outsiders.\"<ref>\"Acting White\". By Roland G. Fryer, Jr. Education Next. Winter 2006 (vol. 6, no. 1).</ref> Therefore, not only are there economic and prehistoric causes of racial educational segregation, but there are also social notions that continue to be obstacles to be overcome before minority groups can achieve success in education.\n\nMississippi is one of the US states where some public schools still remain highly segregated just like the 1960s when discrimination against black people was very rampant.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/us/history-of-segregation-still-evident-in-mississippi-region-1.3181796|title=History of segregation still evident in Mississippi region|work=The Irish Times|access-date=2018-07-18|language=en-US}}</ref> In many communities where black kids represent the majority, white children are the only ones who enroll in small private schools.

The state was more segregated for black students compared to any other Southern state. There is a case of double segregation because students have become isolated both by race and household income. In New York City, 19 out of 32 school districts have fewer white students.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/03/26/new-york-schools-segregated_n_5034455.html|title=The Nation's Most Segregated Schools Aren't Where You'd Think They'd Be|last=Resmovits|first=Joy|date=2014-03-26|work=Huffington Post|access-date=2018-07-18|language=en-US}}</ref> The United States Supreme Court tried to deal with school segregation more than six decades ago but impoverished and colored students still do not have equal access to opportunities in education.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.uscourts.gov/educational-resources/educational-activities/history-brown-v-board-education-re-enactment|title=History \u2013 Brown v.

Poorer inner-cities often lack the health care that is available in outside areas. That many inner-cities are so isolated from other parts of society also is a large contributor to the poor health often found in inner-city residents. The overcrowded living conditions in the inner-city caused by hypersegregation means that the spread of infectious diseases, such as [[tuberculosis]], occurs much more frequently.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Acevedo-Garcia |first=Dolores |title=Residential Segregation and the Epidemiology of Infectious Diseases |journal=Social Science & Medicine |volume=51 |issue=8 |year=2000 |pages=1143\u20131161 |doi=10.1016/S0277-9536(00)00016-2 |pmid=11037206 }}</ref> This is known as \"epidemic injustice\" because racial groups confined in a certain area are affected much more often than those living outside the area.\n\nPoor inner-city residents also must contend with other factors that negatively affect health. Research has proven that in every major American city, hypersegregated blacks are far more likely to be exposed to dangerous levels of air toxins.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Lopez |first=R. |title=Segregation and Black/White Differences in Exposure to Air Toxics in 1990 |journal=[[Environmental Health Perspectives]] |volume=110 |issue=Suppl. 2 |year=2002 |pages=289\u2013295 |doi= 10.1289/ehp.02110s2289 |pmid=11929740 |pmc=1241175 |jstor=3455065 }}</ref> Daily exposure to this polluted air means that African-Americans living in these areas are at greater risk of disease.\n\n===Crime===\nOne area where hypersegregation seems to have the greatest effect is in violence experienced by residents. The number of violent crimes in the U.S. in general has fallen. The number of murders in the U.S. fell 9% from the 1980s to the 1990s.<ref name=\"Getting Away with Murder\">{{Cite journal| author = Douglas S.

As of 1993, young African-American men are eleven times more likely to be shot to death and nine times more likely to be murdered than their European American peers.<ref name=\"American Apartheid\"/> Poverty, high unemployment, and broken families, all factors more prevalent in hypersegregated inner-cities, all contribute significantly to the unequal levels of violence experienced by African-Americans. Research has proven that the more segregated the surrounding European American suburban ring is, the rate of violent crime in the inner-city will rise, but, likewise, crime in the outer area will drop.<ref name=\"Getting Away with Murder\"/>\n\n===Poverty===\nOne study finds that an area's residential racial segregation increases metropolitan rates of black poverty and overall black-white [[income inequality in the United States|income disparities]], while decreasing rates of white poverty and [[racial inequality in the United States|inequality]] within the white population.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = The Wrong Side(s) of the Tracks: The Causal Effects of Racial Segregation on Urban Poverty and Inequality|journal = American Economic Journal: Applied Economics|date = 2011-04-01|issn = 1945-7782|pages = 34\u201366|volume = 3|issue = 2|doi = 10.1257/app.3.2.34|first = Elizabeth Oltmans|last = Ananat|citeseerx = 10.1.1.637.8290}}</ref>\n\n===Single parenthood===\nOne study finds that African-Americans who live in segregated metro areas have a higher likelihood of single-parenthood than Blacks who live in more integrated places.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Are Ghettos Good or Bad?|url = http://qje.oxfordjournals.org/content/112/3/827|journal = The Quarterly Journal of Economics|date = 1997-08-01|issn = 0033-5533|pages = 827\u2013872|volume = 112|issue = 3|doi = 10.1162/003355397555361|first = David M.|last = Cutler|first2 = Edward L.|last2 = Glaeser}}</ref>\n\n===Public spending===\nResearch shows that segregation along racial lines contributes to public goods inequalities.

Everyone was supposed to receive the same public services (schools, hospitals, prisons, etc.), but with separate facilities for each race. In practice, the services and facilities reserved for African-Americans were almost always of lower quality than those reserved for whites, if they existed at all; for example, most [[African-American schools]] received less public funding per student than nearby white schools. Segregation was never mandated by law in the Northern states, but a ''de facto'' system grew for schools, in which nearly all black students attended schools that were nearly all-black. In the South, white schools had only white pupils and teachers, while black schools had only black teachers and black students.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.aft.org/periodical/american-educator/summer-2004/jim-crows-schools|title=Jim Crow's Schools|date=2014-08-08|work=American Federation of Teachers|access-date=2018-05-29|language=en}}</ref>\n\nSome [[streetcar]] companies did not segregate voluntarily.

Exposure is the likelihood that a minority and a majority party will come in contact with one another. Clustering is the gathering of different minority groups into a single space; clustering often leads to one big [[ghetto]] and the formation of hyperghettoization. Centralization measures the tendency of members of a minority group to be located in the middle of an urban area, often computed as a percentage of a minority group living in the middle of a city (as opposed to the outlying areas). Concentration is the dimension that relates to the actual amount of land a minority lives on within its particular city. The higher segregation is within that particular area, the smaller the amount of land a minority group will control.\n\nThe pattern of hypersegregation began in the early 20th century. African-Americans who moved to large cities often moved into the inner-city in order to gain industrial jobs. The influx of new African-American residents caused many European American residents to move to the suburbs in a case of [[white flight]]. As industry began to move out of the inner-city, the African-American residents lost the stable jobs that had brought them to the area. Many were unable to leave the inner-city, however, and they became increasingly poor.<ref name=\"Hurst\">{{Cite book| author = Charles E.

The United States government began making low-interest mortgages available to families through the [[Federal Housing Administration]] (FHA) and the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Veteran's Administration]]. Black families were legally entitled to these loans but were sometimes denied these loans because the planners behind this initiative labeled many black neighborhoods throughout the country as \"in decline\".

Parks' civil disobedience had the effect of sparking the [[Montgomery Bus Boycott]]. Parks' act of defiance became an important symbol of the modern [[Civil Rights Movement]] and Parks became an international icon of resistance to racial segregation. \n[[File:1943 Colored Waiting Room Sign.jpg|thumb|Sign for \"colored\" waiting room at a [[Greyhound Lines|Greyhound]] bus terminal in [[Rome, Georgia]], 1943.]]\n\nSegregation was also pervasive in housing. State constitutions (for example, that of [[California Constitution|California]]) had clauses giving local jurisdictions the right to regulate where members of certain races could live. In 1917, the Supreme Court in the case of ''[[Buchanan v. Warley]]'' declared municipal resident segregation [[Local ordinance|ordinances]] unconstitutional. In response, whites resorted to the [[restrictive covenant]], a formal deed restriction binding white property owners in a given neighborhood not to sell to blacks.

Kraemer]]'', the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] finally ruled that such covenants were unenforceable in a court of law. However, residential segregation patterns had already become established in most American cities, and have often persisted up to the present (see [[white flight]] and [[Redlining]]).\n\nIn most cities, the only way blacks could relieve the pressure of crowding that resulted from increasing migration was to expand residential borders into surrounding previously white neighborhoods, a process that often resulted in harassment and attacks by white residents whose intolerant attitudes were intensified by fears that black neighbors would cause property values to decline. Moreover, the increased presence of African Americans in cities, North and South, as well as their competition with whites for housing, jobs, and political influence sparked a series of race riots. In 1898 white citizens of Wilmington, North Carolina, resenting African Americans' involvement in local government and incensed by an editorial in an African-American newspaper accusing white women of loose sexual behavior, rioted and killed dozens of blacks. In the fury's wake, white supremacists overthrew the city government, expelling black and white office holders, and instituted restrictions to prevent blacks from voting. In Atlanta in 1906, newspaper accounts alleging attacks by black men on white women provoked an outburst of shooting and killing that left twelve blacks dead and seventy injured. An influx of unskilled black strikebreakers into [[East St Louis, Illinois]], heightened racial tensions in 1917. Rumors that blacks were arming themselves for an attack on whites resulted in numerous attacks by white mobs on black neighborhoods. On July 1, blacks fired back at a car whose occupants they believed had shot into their homes and mistakenly killed two policemen riding in a car. The next day, a full scaled riot erupted which ended only after nine whites and thirty-nine blacks had been killed and over three hundred buildings were destroyed.\n\nWith the migration to the North of many black workers at the turn of the 20th century, and the friction that occurred between white and black workers during this time, segregation was and continues to be a phenomenon in northern cities as well as in the South. Whites generally allocate [[tenements]] as housing to the poorest blacks. It would be well to remember, though, that while racism had to be legislated out of the South, many in the North, including [[Religious Society of Friends|Quakers]] and others who ran the [[Underground Railroad]], were ideologically opposed to Southerners' treatment of blacks. By the same token, many white Southerners have a claim to closer relationships with blacks than wealthy northern whites, regardless of the latter's stated political persuasion.<ref>[http://www.skidmore.edu/~dkarp/Social%20Issues/E/history.html History of Residential Segregation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041114125050/http://www.skidmore.edu/~dkarp/Social%20Issues/E/history.html |date=November 14, 2004 }}</ref>\n\n[[Anti-miscegenation laws]] (also known as miscegenation laws) prohibited whites and non-whites from marrying each other.

This phenomenon is due to [[white flight]] where whites actively leave neighborhoods often because of a black presence. There are more than just geographical consequences to this, as the money leaves and poverty grows, crime rates jump and businesses leave and follow the money. This creates a job shortage in segregated neighborhoods and perpetuates the economic inequality in the inner city. With the wealth and businesses gone from inner city areas, the tax base decreases, which hurts funding for education. Consequently, those that can afford to leave the area for better schools leave decreasing the tax base for educational funding even more. Any business that is left or would consider opening doesn't want to invest in a place nobody has any money but has a lot of crime, meaning the only things that are left in these communities are poor black people with little opportunity for employment or education.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Newman |first=Katherine |title=No Shame in My Game: The Working Poor in the Inner City |url=https://archive.org/details/noshameinmygamew00newm |url-access=registration |location=New York |publisher=Knopf |year=1999 |isbn=978-0-375-40254-8 }}</ref>\n\nToday, a number of whites are willing, and are able, to pay a premium to live in a predominantly white neighborhood.

In Washington, D.C., 94 percent of children were black or Hispanic; less than 5 percent were white.\n\n[[Jonathan Kozol]] expanded on this topic in his book ''[[The Shame of the Nation]]: The Restoration of Apartheid Schooling in America.''\n\nThe \"New American apartheid\" refers to the allegation that US drug and criminal policies in practice target blacks on the basis of race. The radical left-wing web-magazine [[ZNet]] featured a series of 4 articles on \"The New American Apartheid\" in which it drew parallels between the treatment of blacks by the American justice system and apartheid:\n\n<blockquote>Modern prisoners occupy the lowest rungs on the social class ladder, and they always have. The modern prison system (along with local jails) is a collection of ghettos or poorhouses reserved primarily for the unskilled, the uneducated, and the powerless. In increasing numbers this system is being reserved for racial minorities, especially blacks, which is why we are calling it the New American Apartheid. This is the same segment of American society that has experienced some of the most drastic reductions in income and they have been targeted for their involvement in drugs and the subsequent violence that extends from the lack of legitimate means of goal attainment.<ref>Shelden, Randall G.\nand William B.

This serves the purpose of making students of color more comfortable and highlighting the challenges they face on historically white-dominated campuses, although it may impair the ability of such students to interact with people outside of their specific group.<ref>{{cite web\n | url =https://www.nas.org/reports/separate-but-equal-again\n | title =Separate but Equal, Again\n | last =Pierre\n | first =Dion\n | date =29 April 2019\n | website =National Association of Scholars\n | access-date =28 June 2019 }}</ref>\n\nDue to education being funded primarily through local and state revenue, the quality of education varies greatly depending on the geographical location of the school. In some areas, education is primarily funded through revenue from property taxes; therefore, there is a direct correlation in some areas between the price of homes and the amount of money allocated to educating the area's youth.<ref name=\"autogenerated2004\">Massey, Douglas S. 2004. \"The New Geography of Inequality in Urban America,\" in C. Michael Henry, ed. Race, Poverty, and Domestic Policy. New Haven: Yale University Press.</ref> A 2010 US Census showed that 27.4% of all African-Americans lived under the poverty line, the highest percentage of any other ethnic group in the United States.<ref>Income, Poverty and Health Insurance Coverage in the United States: 2010\". U.S. Census Bureau</ref> Therefore, in predominantly African-American areas, otherwise known as 'ghettos', the amount of money available for education is extremely low. This is referred to as \"funding segregation\".<ref name=\"autogenerated2004\"/> This questionable system of educational funding can be seen as one of the primary reasons contemporary racial segregation continues to prosper. Predominantly Caucasian areas with more money funneled into primary and secondary educational institutions, allow their students the resources to succeed academically and obtain post-secondary degrees. This practice continues to ethnically, socially and economically divide America.\n\nAlternative certificate programs were introduced in many inner-city schools and rural areas. These programs award a person a teaching license even though he/she has not completed a traditional teaching degree. This program came into effect in the 1980s throughout most states in response to the dwindling number of people seeking to earn a secondary degree in education.<ref>Feistritzer, Emily (February 1, 2006). \"Alternative Teacher Certification\". National Center for Alternative Certification</ref> This program has been very controversial. It is, \"booming despite little more than anecdotal evidence of their success.[\u2026] there are concerns about how they will perform as teachers, especially since they are more likely to end up in poor districts teaching students in challenging situations.\"<ref>{{cite news |author1=Morgan Smith  |author2=Nick Pandolfo  |lastauthoramp=yes |title=For-Profit Certification for Teachers is Booming |newspaper= The New York Times |date=November 26, 2011 |accessdate= November 4, 2012 |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/27/us/for-profit-certification-for-teachers-in-texas-is-booming.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0}}</ref> Alternative Certificate graduates tend to teach African-Americans and other ethnic minorities in inner-city schools and schools in impoverished small rural towns. Therefore, impoverished minorities not only have to cope with having the smallest amount of resources for their educational facilities but also with having the least trained teachers in the nation. Valorie Delp, a mother residing in an inner-city area whose child attends a school taught by teachers awarded by an alternative certificate program notes:\n\n<blockquote>One teacher we know who is in this program said he had visions of coming in to \"save\" the kids and the school and he really believes that this idea was kind of stoked in his program. No one ever says that you may have kids who threaten to stab you, or call you unspeakable names to your face, or can't read despite being in 7th grade.<ref>{{cite web|author=Valorie Delp |title=My Inner City Story: Why Alternative Certification Programs Don't Work, Parenting Education |accessdate= November 4, 2012 |url= http://education.families.com/blog/my-inner-city-story-how-alternative-teacher-certification-programs-do-a-disservice-to-the-inner-city}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nDelp showcases that, while many graduates of these certificate programs have honorable intentions and are educated, intelligent people, there is a reason why teachers have traditionally had to take a significant amount of training before officially being certified as a teacher. The experience they gain through their practicum and extensive classroom experience equips them with the tools necessary to educate today's youth.\n\nSome measures have been taken to try give less affluent families the ability to educate their children. President [[Ronald Reagan]] introduced the McKinney\u2013Vento Homeless Assistance Act on July 22, 1987.<ref>Department of Education, Office of Elementary and Secondary Education, \"McKinney-Vento Education for Homeless Children and Youths Program: Notice of school enrollment guidelines\"</ref> This Act was meant to allow children the ability to succeed if their families did not have a permanent residence. Leo Stagman, a single, African-American parent, located in Berkeley, California, whose daughter had received a great deal of aid from the Act wrote on October 20, 2012 that, \"During her education, she [Leo's daughter] was eligible for the free lunch program and received assistance under the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Educational Act. I know my daughter's performance is hers, but I wonder where she would have been without the assistance she received under the McKinney-Vento Act. Many students at BHS owe their graduation and success to the assistance under this law.\"<ref name=\"sfbayview1\">{{cite news |first=Leo |last=Stagman |title=Racism and classism in Berkeley streets and schools |publisher=San Francisco Bay View National Black Newspaper |date=October 24, 2012 |accessdate= November 4, 2012 |url=http://sfbayview.com/2012/racism-and-classism-in-berkeley-streets-and-schools/}}</ref>\n\nLeo then goes on to note that, \"the majority of the students receiving assistance under the act are Black and Brown.\"<ref name=\"sfbayview1\"/> There have been various other Acts enacted to try and aid impoverished youth with the chance to succeed. One of these Acts includes the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (NCLB). This Act was meant to increase the accountability of public schools and their teachers by creating standardized testing which would give an overview of the success of the school's ability to educate their students.<ref name=\"reauthorization1\">{{cite web |title=ELEMENTARY & SECONDARY EDUCATION: A Blueprint for Reform: The Reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act |publisher= US Department of Education |url=http://www2.ed.gov/policy/elsec/leg/blueprint/publication_pg7.html#part7|date= 2011-05-27 }}</ref> Schools which repeatedly performed poorly would have increased attention and assistance from the federal government.<ref name=\"reauthorization1\"/> One of the intended outcomes of the Act was to narrow the class and racial [[achievement gap in the United States]] by instituting common expectations for all students.<ref name=\"reauthorization1\"/> Test scores have shown to be improving for minority populations, however, they are improving at the same rate for Caucasian children as well. This Act therefore, has done little to close the educational gap between Caucasian and minority children.<ref>\"Charting the Course: States Decide Major Provisions Under No Child Left Behind.\" U.S. Department of Education.</ref>\n\nThere has also been an issue with minority populations becoming educated because to a fear of being accused of \"Acting White\". It is a hard definition to pin down, however, this is a negative term predominantly used by African-Americans that showing interest in one's studies is a betrayal of the African-American culture as one is trying to be a part of white society rather than staying true to his/her roots. Roland G. Fryer, Jr., at Harvard University has noted that, \"There is necessarily a trade-off between doing well and rejection by your peers when you come from a traditionally low-achieving group, especially when that group comes into contact with more outsiders.\"<ref>\"Acting White\". By Roland G. Fryer, Jr. Education Next. Winter 2006 (vol. 6, no. 1).</ref> Therefore, not only are there economic and prehistoric causes of racial educational segregation, but there are also social notions that continue to be obstacles to be overcome before minority groups can achieve success in education.\n\nMississippi is one of the US states where some public schools still remain highly segregated just like the 1960s when discrimination against black people was very rampant.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/us/history-of-segregation-still-evident-in-mississippi-region-1.3181796|title=History of segregation still evident in Mississippi region|work=The Irish Times|access-date=2018-07-18|language=en-US}}</ref> In many communities where black kids represent the majority, white children are the only ones who enroll in small private schools. The University of Mississippi, the state\u2019s flagship academic institution enrolls unreasonably few African-American and Latino youngsters.

The state was more segregated for black students compared to any other Southern state. There is a case of double segregation because students have become isolated both by race and household income. In New York City, 19 out of 32 school districts have fewer white students.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/03/26/new-york-schools-segregated_n_5034455.html|title=The Nation's Most Segregated Schools Aren't Where You'd Think They'd Be|last=Resmovits|first=Joy|date=2014-03-26|work=Huffington Post|access-date=2018-07-18|language=en-US}}</ref> The United States Supreme Court tried to deal with school segregation more than six decades ago but impoverished and colored students still do not have equal access to opportunities in education.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.uscourts.gov/educational-resources/educational-activities/history-brown-v-board-education-re-enactment|title=History \u2013 Brown v.

Poorer inner-cities often lack the health care that is available in outside areas. That many inner-cities are so isolated from other parts of society also is a large contributor to the poor health often found in inner-city residents. The overcrowded living conditions in the inner-city caused by hypersegregation means that the spread of infectious diseases, such as [[tuberculosis]], occurs much more frequently.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Acevedo-Garcia |first=Dolores |title=Residential Segregation and the Epidemiology of Infectious Diseases |journal=Social Science & Medicine |volume=51 |issue=8 |year=2000 |pages=1143\u20131161 |doi=10.1016/S0277-9536(00)00016-2 |pmid=11037206 }}</ref> This is known as \"epidemic injustice\" because racial groups confined in a certain area are affected much more often than those living outside the area.\n\nPoor inner-city residents also must contend with other factors that negatively affect health. Research has proven that in every major American city, hypersegregated blacks are far more likely to be exposed to dangerous levels of air toxins.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Lopez |first=R. |title=Segregation and Black/White Differences in Exposure to Air Toxics in 1990 |journal=[[Environmental Health Perspectives]] |volume=110 |issue=Suppl. 2 |year=2002 |pages=289\u2013295 |doi= 10.1289/ehp.02110s2289 |pmid=11929740 |pmc=1241175 |jstor=3455065 }}</ref> Daily exposure to this polluted air means that African-Americans living in these areas are at greater risk of disease.\n\n===Crime===\nOne area where hypersegregation seems to have the greatest effect is in violence experienced by residents. The number of violent crimes in the U.S. in general has fallen. The number of murders in the U.S. fell 9% from the 1980s to the 1990s.<ref name=\"Getting Away with Murder\">{{Cite journal| author = Douglas S.

As of 1993, young African-American men are eleven times more likely to be shot to death and nine times more likely to be murdered than their European American peers.<ref name=\"American Apartheid\"/> Poverty, high unemployment, and broken families, all factors more prevalent in hypersegregated inner-cities, all contribute significantly to the unequal levels of violence experienced by African-Americans. Research has proven that the more segregated the surrounding European American suburban ring is, the rate of violent crime in the inner-city will rise, but, likewise, crime in the outer area will drop.<ref name=\"Getting Away with Murder\"/>\n\n===Poverty===\nOne study finds that an area's residential racial segregation increases metropolitan rates of black poverty and overall black-white [[income inequality in the United States|income disparities]], while decreasing rates of white poverty and [[racial inequality in the United States|inequality]] within the white population.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = The Wrong Side(s) of the Tracks: The Causal Effects of Racial Segregation on Urban Poverty and Inequality|journal = American Economic Journal: Applied Economics|date = 2011-04-01|issn = 1945-7782|pages = 34\u201366|volume = 3|issue = 2|doi = 10.1257/app.3.2.34|first = Elizabeth Oltmans|last = Ananat|citeseerx = 10.1.1.637.8290}}</ref>\n\n===Single parenthood===\nOne study finds that African-Americans who live in segregated metro areas have a higher likelihood of single-parenthood than Blacks who live in more integrated places.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Are Ghettos Good or Bad?|url = http://qje.oxfordjournals.org/content/112/3/827|journal = The Quarterly Journal of Economics|date = 1997-08-01|issn = 0033-5533|pages = 827\u2013872|volume = 112|issue = 3|doi = 10.1162/003355397555361|first = David M.|last = Cutler|first2 = Edward L.|last2 = Glaeser}}</ref>\n\n===Public spending===\nResearch shows that segregation along racial lines contributes to public goods inequalities.

Walpole is also the longest-serving British prime minister by this definition.{{sfn|BBC News|1998}} However, [[Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman]] was the first and [[Margaret Thatcher]] the longest-serving prime minister officially referred to as such in the order of precedence.{{sfnm|1a1=Mackay|1y=1987|2a1=Marriott|2y=1923|2p=83}} The first to use the title in an official act was [[Benjamin Disraeli]], who signed the [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)|Treaty of Berlin]] as \"Prime Minister of her Britannic Majesty\" in 1878.{{sfn|Bogdanor|1997}}\n\nStrictly, the first prime minister of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom (of Great Britain and Ireland)]] was [[William Pitt the Younger]].{{sfnm|1a1=Burt|1y=1874|1p=106|2a1=Castlereagh|2y=1805}} The first prime minister of the current United Kingdom, i.e. the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, was [[Bonar Law]],{{sfn|Law|1922}} although the country was not renamed officially until 1927, when [[Stanley Baldwin]] was the serving prime minister.{{sfn|Royal and Parliamentary Titles Act|1927}}\n\nDue to the gradual evolution of the post of prime minister, the title is applied to early prime ministers only retrospectively;{{sfn|Leonard|2010|page=1}} this has sometimes given rise to academic dispute. [[William Pulteney, 1st Earl of Bath|Lord Bath]] and [[James Waldegrave, 2nd Earl Waldegrave|Lord Waldegrave]] are sometimes listed as prime ministers.{{sfn|Carpenter|1992|page=37}} Bath was invited to [[Short-lived ministry|form a ministry]] by [[George II of Great Britain|{{nowrap|George II}}]] when [[Henry Pelham]] resigned in 1746,{{sfn|Leonard|2010|page=47}} as was Waldegrave in 1757 after the dismissal of [[William Pitt the Elder]],{{sfn|Leonard|2010|page=65}} who dominated the affairs of government [[Great Britain in the Seven Years' War|during the Seven Years' War]]. Neither was able to command sufficient parliamentary support to form a government; Bath stepped down after two days,{{sfn|Carpenter|1992|page=37}} and Waldegrave after three.{{sfn|Leonard|2010|page=65}} Modern academic consensus does not consider either man to have held office as prime minister,{{sfn|''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''|2011}} and they are therefore listed separately.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Before 1721== \nPrior to the [[Georgian era]], the [[HM Treasury|Treasury]] of [[Kingdom of England|England]] was led by the [[Lord High Treasurer]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911f}} By the late [[Tudor period]], the Lord High Treasurer was regarded as one of the [[Great Officers of State]],{{sfn|Chisholm|1911f}} and was often (though not always) the dominant figure in government: [[Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset]] (Lord High Treasurer, 1547\u20131549),{{sfn|Pollard|1904}} served as [[Lord Protector]] to his prepubescent nephew [[Edward VI of England|{{nowrap|Edward VI}}]];{{sfn|Pollard|1904}} [[William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley]] (Lord High Treasurer, 1572\u20131598),{{sfn|Chisholm|1911a}} was the dominant [[List of ministers to Queen Elizabeth I|minister to {{nowrap|Elizabeth I}}]];{{sfn|Chisholm|1911a}} Burghley's son [[Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury]], succeeded his father as chief minister to {{nowrap|Elizabeth I}} (1598\u20131603) and was eventually appointed by [[James VI and I|{{nowrap|James I}}]] as Lord High Treasurer (1608\u20131612).{{sfn|Chisholm|1911c}}\n\nBy the late [[Stuart period]], the Treasury was often run not by a single individual, i.e. Lord High Treasurer, but by a [[wikt:commission#Noun|commission]] of [[Lords of the Treasury]],{{sfn|Chapman|2002}} led by the [[First Lord of the Treasury]]. The last Lords High Treasurer, [[Lord Godolphin]] (1702\u20131710) and [[Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer|Lord Oxford]] (1711\u20131714),{{sfnm|1a1=Fisher Russell Barker|1y=1890|2a1=Stephen|2y=1890}} ran the government of [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]].{{sfn|Morrill|2018}}\n\nAfter the succession of [[George I of Great Britain|{{nowrap|George I}}]] in 1714, the arrangement of a commission of Lords of the Treasury (as opposed to a single Lord High Treasurer) became permanent.{{sfn|Chapman|2002|page=15}} For the next three years, the government was headed by [[Charles Townshend, 2nd Viscount Townshend|Lord Townshend]], who was appointed [[Secretary of State for the Northern Department]].{{sfn|McMullen Rigg|1899}} Subsequently, [[James Stanhope, 1st Earl Stanhope|Lord Stanhope]] and [[Charles Spencer, 3rd Earl of Sunderland|Lord Sunderland]] ran the government jointly,{{sfnm|1a1=Chisholm|1y=1911d|2a1=Chisholm|2y=1911e}} with Stanhope managing foreign affairs and Sunderland domestic.{{sfnm|1a1=Chisholm|1y=1911d|2a1=Chisholm|2y=1911e}} Stanhope died in February 1721 and Sunderland resigned two months later;{{sfnm|1a1=Chisholm|1y=1911d|2a1=Chisholm|2y=1911e}} Townshend and [[Robert Walpole]] were then invited to form the next government.{{sfnm|1a1=Chisholm|1y=1911b|2a1=McMullen Rigg|2y=1899}} From that point, the holder of the {{em|office}} of First Lord also usually (albeit unofficially) held the status of prime minister. It was not until the [[Edwardian era]] that the title {{em|[[prime minister]]}} was constitutionally recognised.{{sfn|Leonard|2010|page=1}} The prime minister still holds the office of First Lord by constitutional convention,{{sfn|UK Government|2013}} the only exceptions being [[Lord Chatham]] (1766\u20131768) and [[Lord Salisbury]] (1885\u20131886, 1887\u20131892, 1895\u20131902).{{sfnm|1a1=Englefield|1a2=Seaton|1a3=White|1y=1995|1p=413|2a1=Locker-Lampson|2y=1907|2p=497}}\n\n==Living former officeholders==\n{{Further|Living prime ministers of the United Kingdom}}\nAs of {{Monthyear}}, there are five [[Living prime ministers of the United Kingdom|living former British prime ministers]].

There is no specific date for when the office of prime minister first appeared, as the role was not created but rather evolved over a period of time through a merger of duties.{{sfn|Hennessy|2001|pp=39\u201340}} However, the term was regularly if informally used of Walpole by the 1730s.<ref>Stephen Taylor ODNB</ref> It was used in the [[House of Commons of Great Britain|House of Commons]] as early as 1805,{{sfn|Castlereagh|1805}} and it was certainly in parliamentary use by the 1880s.{{sfnm|1a1=Eardley-Wilmot|1y=1885|2a1=Macfarlane|2y=1885}} In 1905 the post of prime minister was officially given recognition in the [[Orders of precedence in the United Kingdom|order of precedence]].{{sfn|Marriott|1923|page=83}} Modern historians generally consider [[Sir Robert Walpole]], who led the government of [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] for over twenty years from 1721,{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1999|1p=266|2a1=Hennessy|2y=2001|2pp=39\u201340}} as the first prime minister. Walpole is also the longest-serving British prime minister by this definition.{{sfn|BBC News|1998}} However, [[Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman]] was the first and [[Margaret Thatcher]] the longest-serving prime minister officially referred to as such in the order of precedence.{{sfnm|1a1=Mackay|1y=1987|2a1=Marriott|2y=1923|2p=83}} The first to use the title in an official act was [[Benjamin Disraeli]], who signed the [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)|Treaty of Berlin]] as \"Prime Minister of her Britannic Majesty\" in 1878.{{sfn|Bogdanor|1997}}\n\nStrictly, the first prime minister of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom (of Great Britain and Ireland)]] was [[William Pitt the Younger]].{{sfnm|1a1=Burt|1y=1874|1p=106|2a1=Castlereagh|2y=1805}} The first prime minister of the current United Kingdom, i.e. the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, was [[Bonar Law]],{{sfn|Law|1922}} although the country was not renamed officially until 1927, when [[Stanley Baldwin]] was the serving prime minister.{{sfn|Royal and Parliamentary Titles Act|1927}}\n\nDue to the gradual evolution of the post of prime minister, the title is applied to early prime ministers only retrospectively;{{sfn|Leonard|2010|page=1}} this has sometimes given rise to academic dispute. [[William Pulteney, 1st Earl of Bath|Lord Bath]] and [[James Waldegrave, 2nd Earl Waldegrave|Lord Waldegrave]] are sometimes listed as prime ministers.{{sfn|Carpenter|1992|page=37}} Bath was invited to [[Short-lived ministry|form a ministry]] by [[George II of Great Britain|{{nowrap|George II}}]] when [[Henry Pelham]] resigned in 1746,{{sfn|Leonard|2010|page=47}} as was Waldegrave in 1757 after the dismissal of [[William Pitt the Elder]],{{sfn|Leonard|2010|page=65}} who dominated the affairs of government [[Great Britain in the Seven Years' War|during the Seven Years' War]]. Neither was able to command sufficient parliamentary support to form a government; Bath stepped down after two days,{{sfn|Carpenter|1992|page=37}} and Waldegrave after three.{{sfn|Leonard|2010|page=65}} Modern academic consensus does not consider either man to have held office as prime minister,{{sfn|''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''|2011}} and they are therefore listed separately.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Before 1721== \nPrior to the [[Georgian era]], the [[HM Treasury|Treasury]] of [[Kingdom of England|England]] was led by the [[Lord High Treasurer]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911f}} By the late [[Tudor period]], the Lord High Treasurer was regarded as one of the [[Great Officers of State]],{{sfn|Chisholm|1911f}} and was often (though not always) the dominant figure in government: [[Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset]] (Lord High Treasurer, 1547\u20131549),{{sfn|Pollard|1904}} served as [[Lord Protector]] to his prepubescent nephew [[Edward VI of England|{{nowrap|Edward VI}}]];{{sfn|Pollard|1904}} [[William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley]] (Lord High Treasurer, 1572\u20131598),{{sfn|Chisholm|1911a}} was the dominant [[List of ministers to Queen Elizabeth I|minister to {{nowrap|Elizabeth I}}]];{{sfn|Chisholm|1911a}} Burghley's son [[Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury]], succeeded his father as chief minister to {{nowrap|Elizabeth I}} (1598\u20131603) and was eventually appointed by [[James VI and I|{{nowrap|James I}}]] as Lord High Treasurer (1608\u20131612).{{sfn|Chisholm|1911c}}\n\nBy the late [[Stuart period]], the Treasury was often run not by a single individual, i.e. Lord High Treasurer, but by a [[wikt:commission#Noun|commission]] of [[Lords of the Treasury]],{{sfn|Chapman|2002}} led by the [[First Lord of the Treasury]]. The last Lords High Treasurer, [[Lord Godolphin]] (1702\u20131710) and [[Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer|Lord Oxford]] (1711\u20131714),{{sfnm|1a1=Fisher Russell Barker|1y=1890|2a1=Stephen|2y=1890}} ran the government of [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]].{{sfn|Morrill|2018}}\n\nAfter the succession of [[George I of Great Britain|{{nowrap|George I}}]] in 1714, the arrangement of a commission of Lords of the Treasury (as opposed to a single Lord High Treasurer) became permanent.{{sfn|Chapman|2002|page=15}} For the next three years, the government was headed by [[Charles Townshend, 2nd Viscount Townshend|Lord Townshend]], who was appointed [[Secretary of State for the Northern Department]].{{sfn|McMullen Rigg|1899}} Subsequently, [[James Stanhope, 1st Earl Stanhope|Lord Stanhope]] and [[Charles Spencer, 3rd Earl of Sunderland|Lord Sunderland]] ran the government jointly,{{sfnm|1a1=Chisholm|1y=1911d|2a1=Chisholm|2y=1911e}} with Stanhope managing foreign affairs and Sunderland domestic.{{sfnm|1a1=Chisholm|1y=1911d|2a1=Chisholm|2y=1911e}} Stanhope died in February 1721 and Sunderland resigned two months later;{{sfnm|1a1=Chisholm|1y=1911d|2a1=Chisholm|2y=1911e}} Townshend and [[Robert Walpole]] were then invited to form the next government.{{sfnm|1a1=Chisholm|1y=1911b|2a1=McMullen Rigg|2y=1899}} From that point, the holder of the {{em|office}} of First Lord also usually (albeit unofficially) held the status of prime minister.

It was formerly the seat of a [[princely state]] of the same name. Jodhpur was historically the capital of the [[Jodhpur State|Kingdom of Marwar]], which is now part of Rajasthan. Jodhpur is a popular tourist destination, featuring many [[palace]]s, [[fort]]s and [[temple]]s, set in the stark landscape of the [[Thar Desert]]. It is popularly known as Blue city and Sun city among people of Rajasthan and all over India.<ref name=bluecity/> The city is also said to be the cultural capital of Rajasthan state.\n\nThe old city circles the [[Mehrangarh|Mehrangarh Fort]] and is bounded by a wall with several gates. The houses in the old city are typically painted in a blue hue probably to escape heat or for adornment, giving the city its nickname \"Blue City\".<ref name=Madan>{{cite book|title=India through the ages|url=https://archive.org/details/indiathroughages00mada|last=Gopal|first=Madan|year= 1990| page= [https://archive.org/details/indiathroughages00mada/page/178 178]|editor=K.S.

Jodha succeeded in conquering the surrounding territory and thus founded a kingdom which came to be known as [[Marwar]]. As Jodha hailed from the nearby town of [[Mandore]], that town initially served as the [[Capital (political)|capital]] of this state; however, Jodhpur soon took over that role, even during the lifetime of Jodha. The city was located on the strategic road linking [[Delhi]] to [[Gujarat]]. This enabled it to profit from a flourishing trade in [[opium]], [[copper]], [[silk]], [[sandalwood]], [[date (fruit)|dates]] and other tradeable goods.<ref name=history1>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SktuAAAAMAAJ|title=The House of Marwar: The Story of Jodhpur|author=Dhananajaya Singh|publisher=Lotus Collection |year=1994|ASIN=B003FD2ISQ}}</ref>\n\n=== Early Modern period ===\nAfter the death of Rao [[Chandrasen Rathore]] in 1581, the kingdom annexed by the Mughal Emperor [[Akbar]], Marwar thus became a Mughal vassal owing [[fealty]] to them while enjoying internal [[autonomy]]. Jodhpur and its people benefited from this exposure to the wider world as new styles of [[Indian art|art]] and [[Indian Architecture|architecture]] made their appearance and opportunities opened up for local tradesmen to make their mark across northern India.<ref name=history1/>\n\n[[File:JODHPUR 1960.jpg|thumb|View of the Rajasthan High Court, Sardar Museum in Umaid Park and upper right is Jodhpur fort in 1960.]]\n[[Aurangzeb]] briefly sequestrated the state (c. 1679) after the death of [[Maharaja Jaswant Singh]], but the prior ruler [[Ajit Singh of Marwar|Maharaja Ajit Singh]] was restored to the throne by Veer [[Durgadas Rathore]] after Aurangzeb died in 1707 and a great struggle of 30 years. The Mughal empire declined gradually after 1707, but the Jodhpur court was beset by intrigue; rather than benefiting from circumstances, Marwar descended into strife and invited the intervention of the [[Maratha]]s, who soon supplanted the Mughals as overlords of the region. This did not make for stability or peace, however- 50 years of wars and treaties dissipated the wealth of the state, which sought the help of the British and entered into a [[subsidiary alliance]] with them. There was a major revolt in 1857 by some Rathore nobles of [[Pali, Rajasthan|Pali]] led by Thakur Kushal Singh of [[Auwa]], however, the rebels were defeated by the British army under colonel Holmes and peace was restored.<ref>Political Awakening and Indian Freedom Movement with Special Reference to Rajasthan pg 28-35</ref><ref name=history1/>\n\n=== British Colonial period ===\n[[File:Street Scene of Jodhpur India 1906.jpg|thumb|Street Scene of Jodhpur in 1906]]\n\nDuring the [[British Raj]], the state of Jodhpur had the largest land area of any in the [[Rajputana]].

Jodha succeeded in conquering the surrounding territory and thus founded a kingdom which came to be known as [[Marwar]]. As Jodha hailed from the nearby town of [[Mandore]], that town initially served as the [[Capital (political)|capital]] of this state; however, Jodhpur soon took over that role, even during the lifetime of Jodha. The city was located on the strategic road linking [[Delhi]] to [[Gujarat]]. This enabled it to profit from a flourishing trade in [[opium]], [[copper]], [[silk]], [[sandalwood]], [[date (fruit)|dates]] and other tradeable goods.<ref name=history1>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SktuAAAAMAAJ|title=The House of Marwar: The Story of Jodhpur|author=Dhananajaya Singh|publisher=Lotus Collection |year=1994|ASIN=B003FD2ISQ}}</ref>\n\n=== Early Modern period ===\nAfter the death of Rao [[Chandrasen Rathore]] in 1581, the kingdom annexed by the Mughal Emperor [[Akbar]], Marwar thus became a Mughal vassal owing [[fealty]] to them while enjoying internal [[autonomy]].

The Mughal empire declined gradually after 1707, but the Jodhpur court was beset by intrigue; rather than benefiting from circumstances, Marwar descended into strife and invited the intervention of the [[Maratha]]s, who soon supplanted the Mughals as overlords of the region. This did not make for stability or peace, however- 50 years of wars and treaties dissipated the wealth of the state, which sought the help of the British and entered into a [[subsidiary alliance]] with them. There was a major revolt in 1857 by some Rathore nobles of [[Pali, Rajasthan|Pali]] led by Thakur Kushal Singh of [[Auwa]], however, the rebels were defeated by the British army under colonel Holmes and peace was restored.<ref>Political Awakening and Indian Freedom Movement with Special Reference to Rajasthan pg 28-35</ref><ref name=history1/>\n\n=== British Colonial period ===\n[[File:Street Scene of Jodhpur India 1906.jpg|thumb|Street Scene of Jodhpur in 1906]]\n\nDuring the [[British Raj]], the state of Jodhpur had the largest land area of any in the [[Rajputana]].

The Rann is known for its marshy [[Salt pan (geology)|salt flats]] which become snow white after the shallow water dries up each season before the [[monsoon]] rains.\n\nThe district is also known for [[ecology|ecologically]] important [[Banni grasslands]] with their seasonal [[marsh]]y [[wetland]]s which form the outer belt of the Rann of Kutch.\n\nKutch District is surrounded by the [[Gulf of Kutch]] and the [[Arabian Sea]] in south and west, while the northern and eastern parts are surrounded by the [[Great Rann of Kutch|Great]] and [[Little Rann of Kutch|Little Rann]] (seasonal wetlands) of Kutch. When there were not many dams built on its rivers, the Rann of Kutch remained wetlands for a large part of the year. Even today, the region remains wet for a significant part of year.

There are several sites related to the [[Indus valley civilization]] in the region, and it is mentioned in [[Hindu mythology]]. In historic times, Kutch is mentioned in Greek writings during [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]]. It was ruled by [[Menander I]] of [[Greco-Bactrian Kingdom]] which was overthrown by [[Indo-Scythians]] followed by [[Maurya Empire]] and [[Indo-Parthians|Saka]]s. In the first century, it was under [[Western Satraps]] followed by [[Gupta Empire]]. By the fifth century, [[Maitraka]] of [[Valabhi]] took over from which its close association with the ruling clans of Gujarat started. [[Chavda dynasty|Chavdas]] ruled the eastern and central parts by seventh century but came under [[Chaulukya dynasty|Chaulukya]]s by tenth century. After the fall of Chaulukya, [[Vaghela dynasty|Vaghela]]s ruled the state. Following the conquest of Sindh by Muslim rulers, the [[Samma tribe|Rajput Samma]] started moving southwards to Kutch and ruled the western regions initially. By the tenth century, they controlled a significant area of Kutch, and by the thirteenth century they controlled the whole of Kutch and adopted a new dynastic identity, [[Jadeja]].\n\nFor three centuries, Kutch was divided and ruled by three different branches of the Jadeja brothers. In the sixteenth century, Kutch was unified under one rule by Rao [[Khengarji I]] of these branches and his direct descendants ruled for two centuries and had a good relationship with [[Gujarat Sultanate]] and [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]]. One of his descendants, Rayadhan II, left three sons, of whom two died, and a third son, [[Pragmal Ji]] took over the state and founded the current lineage of rulers at the start of the seventeenth century. The descendants of the other brothers founded states in [[Kathiawar]]. After turbulent periods and battles with the armies of Sindh, the state was stabilized in the middle of the eighteenth century by a council known as [[Bar Bhayat ni Jamat]] who placed Rao as a titular head and ruled independently. The state accepted the sovereignty of the [[British East India Company]] in 1819, when Kutch was defeated in battle. The state was devastated by an [[1819 Rann of Kutch earthquake|earthquake in 1819]]. The state stabilized and flourished in business under subsequent rulers.\n\nUpon the [[independence of India]] in 1947, Kutch acceded unto the [[dominion of India]] and was constituted an independent [[commissionaire]]. It was created a [[states and territories of India|state]] within the union of India in 1950. The state witnessed an [[1956 Anjar earthquake|earthquake in 1956]]. On 1 November 1956, [[Kutch State]] was merged with [[Bombay state]], which in 1960 was divided into the new linguistic states of Gujarat and [[Maharashtra]], with Kutch becoming part of [[Gujarat]] state as Kutch district. The district was affected by tropical cyclone in 1998 and the [[2001 Gujarat earthquake|earthquake in 2001]]. The state saw rapid industrialization and growth in tourism in subsequent years.\n\n== Geography ==\nKutch District, at {{Convert|45691.895|sqkm|sqmi}}, is the largest district in India. The administrative headquarters is in [[Bhuj]] which is geographically in the center of district. Other main towns are [[Gandhidham]], [[Rapar]], [[Nakhatrana]], [[Anjar, India|Anjar]], [[Mandvi]], [[Madhapar]], [[Mundra]] and Bhachau. Kutch has 969 villages. Kala Dungar (Black Hill) is the highest point in Kutch at {{Convert|458|m|ft|0}}.\n[[File:A state highway through the Rann of Kutch.jpg|thumb|A state highway through the Rann of Kutch]]\nKutch is virtually an island, as it is surrounded by the [[Arabian Sea]] in the west; the [[Gulf of Kutch]] in south and southeast and [[Rann of Kutch]] in north and northeast. The border with Pakistan lies along the northern edge of the Rann of Kutch, of the [[Sir Creek]]. The Kutch peninsula is an example of active [[Thrust fault|fold and thrust]] [[tectonism]]. In Central Kutch there are four major east-west hill ranges characterized by [[Fault (geology)|fault propagation]] folds with steeply dipping northern limbs and gently dipping southern limbs. From the gradual increasing dimension of the linear chain of hillocks towards the west along the Kutch mainland [[Fault plane|fault]] and the [[epicentre]] of the earthquake of 2001 lying at the eastern extreme of Kutch mainland fault, it is suggested that the eastern part of the Kutch mainland fault is progressively emerging upward. It can be suggested from the absence of distinct [[surface rupture]] both during the [[1956 Anjar earthquake]] and [[2001 Bhuj earthquake]], that movements have taken place along a [[Blind thrust earthquake|blind thrust]]. Villages situated on the blind [[thrust]] in the eastern part of the Kutch mainland hill range (viz. Jawaharnagar, Khirsara, Devisar, Amarsar and Bandhdi) were completely erased during the 2001 earthquake.<ref name=\"karanth\">{{Cite journal |last1=Karanth |first1=R. V. |last2=Gadhavi |first2=M.

The script of the Kutchi language has become extinct. It is now mainly written in the Gujarati script. Samples of Kutch script are available in the [[Kutch Museum]]. The increased use of Gujarati language is mainly because of its being a medium of instruction in schools.\n\n=== People ===\n{{main|Kutchi people}}\n\nKutch district is inhabited by various groups and communities. One can find various nomadic, semi nomadic and artisan groups living in Kutch. [[Ahir]]s constitute a comparatively large group in Kutch.<ref>http://www.apnaorg.com/books/english/aboriginal-tribes/aboriginal-tribes.pdf</ref>\n\n=== Food and drink ===\n{{more citations needed section|date=November 2017}}\n[[File:Dhamakedar Dabeli.jpg|thumb|left|Kutchi Dabeli]]\n[[File:Kutchi thali.JPG|thumb|Kutchi thali]]\n\nThe majority of the population is [[Hindu]] and [[Jain]] and thus largely vegetarian. Jains also refrain from eating ''[[kandmool]]'' food grown below the ground such as [[potatoes]], [[garlic]], [[onion]], and [[Amorphophallus paeoniifolius|yam]]. There are also a sizeable population of Muslims, who eat vegetables, chicken, mutton and occasionally camels.\n\nIn the villages, staple foods include kadi-khichdi, [[Pearl millet|bajra]] and milk ; bajara na rotla with curd and buttermilk is very common food for all the Gujarati people. Bajra was introduced by a king of this region named Lakho Fulani. During his period of exile, he came to know about this grain in some tribal regions. They also extensively drink [[buttermilk]] during lunch. Milk is considered to be sacred food and offering it to somebody is considered a gesture of friendship and welcoming. Settlement of dispute invariably follows offering milk to each other as a concluding remark. In the Kutchi engagement ceremony, the bride's family offers milk to the groom's relatives as a symbol of accepting their relationship.\n\n[[Tea]] is the most popular drink in this region.\n\n== Economy ==\n[[File:Kandla Port.jpg|thumb|[[Kandla Port]]]]\nHistorically Kutch was always considered a backward region due to its location and submerged geography. The situation seemed to have worsened after the disastrous [[2001 Gujarat earthquake|Kutch earthquake]]. But in the next decade, the economy took an almost miraclous jumpstart due to the intense efforts of the Gujarat government. Kutch today is a growing economic and industrial hub in one of India's fastest growing states \u2013 Gujarat. Its location on the far western edge of India has resulted in the commissioning of two major ports Kandla and Mundra. These ports are near most to the Gulf and Europe by the sea route. The hinterland of north-western India hosts more than 50% of India's population.\n\nQuality of roads is good in Kutch. The large part of the growth of Kutch came after intense development by the state government as part of 2001 earthquake relief.\n\nDue to the existence of two major ports i.e. [[Kandla Port|Kandla]] and [[Mundra Port|Mundra]] transportation as a business has thrived. Since historical times the people of Kutch have formed the backbone of trade between Gujarat mainland and Sindh. After the formation of Pakistan this trade stopped for good, but due to the inception of the Kandla port, trade boomed again. Kandla port is also in Kutch. It is considered Gateway to India's North. It is managed by the Kandla Port trust.\n\n=== Mineral ===\n[[File:Lignite-coal.jpg|thumb|[[Lignite]]]]\nKutch is a mineral rich region with a very large reserve of [[Lignite]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hindu.com/fline/fl2006/stories/20030328007012200.htm|title=The brown gold of Kutch \u2013 By tapping the huge mineral deposits of the Kutch region, Gujarat Mineral Development Corporation Ltd. plans to turn the backward area into a prosperous one; SPECIAL FEATURE: GUJARAT; By V.K.

Adani Power expects to tie up funds for its 3300 MW plant by March 2012 and is on track to complete the installation of 10,000 MW projects by 2013.\n\n=== Forestry ===\nKutch district has a scanty forest cover. Hence there is negligible risk of illegal cutting of forests. This coupled with the adequate facilities available at Kandla port has helped establish the timber market. In 1987, \"Kandla Timber Association\" was formed in order to resolve the specific problems of timber importers and timber allied industries coming up during the period. The timber industry is growing at a faster pace with 300 saw mills working in Gandhidham-Kandla Complex.\n\n=== Salt ===\n[[File:Salt worker in Rann of Kutch.jpg|thumb|Salt worker in Rann of Kutch]]\nThe Little Rann of Kutch is known for its traditional salt production and various references mention this to be a 600-year-old activity. During the British period, this activity increased manifold. It was used to fund a substantial part of the military expenses of the British government.\n\nCommunities involved in salt production are mainly Chunvaliya Koli, Ahir and Miyana (Muslim), residing in 107 villages in the periphery of Lesser Rann of Kutch. These communities are traditionally known to have the skills of salt production and are known as 'Agariyas'. Water quality in 107 villages of Lesser Rann of Kutch is saline, thus agriculture is not an option. Hence salt production is the only livelihood option for Agariyas. As per the Salt Commission's report there are 45000 Agariyas working in the salt pans of Kutch. Out of the estimated total annual production of India of about 18&nbsp;million tonnes, Gujarat contributes 75% \u2013 mainly from Kutch and other parts of Saurashtra.\n\n=== Textile Art ===\n[[File:Antique Kutch Embroidery.jpg|thumb|right|An example of Kutch Embroidery \u2013 Antique Dowry Bag]]\n[[File:Ajrak.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ajrak]]]]\nKutch is one of the most prolific regions in India in the area of textile art. Kutch embroidery is dense with motifs, and a variation with mirrors sewn into the embroidery is one of the signature arts of this region.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nWithin the category of Kutch embroidery there are several sub-categories as each tribe and sub-tribe produces a unique signature form of art.\n\nKutch embroidery is an evolving expression of the craft and textile traditions of the Rabaris, a nomadic tribe in Gujarat. Kutch embroidery is unique in the sense that a net is woven on a cloth using thread.The net is then filled in using the same thread by intricate interlocking stitches. The patterns are usually built around geometric shapes.This embroidery follows its own traditional design logic and juxtaposition of colours and motifs. The Rohanas tribals of Kutch specialise in skirt work. The Sodhas use a geometric style for their embroidery. The Garacia Jats are experts in tiny embroidery on the yoke, which intermingles with red, orange, blue and green threads. The Dhanetah Jats love embroidering broad pear-shaped mirrors using orange, black, yellow and red in chain stitch.\n\n== Religion ==\n{{bar box\n| title    = Religions in Kutch District\n| titlebar = #FCD116\n| left1    = Religion\n| right1   = Percent\n| float    = right\n| bars     = \n{{bar percent|[[Hindus|Hindu]]|orange|76.89}}\n{{bar percent|[[Muslims|Muslim]]|green|21.14}}\n{{bar percent|[[Jainism|Jain]]|pink|1.21}}\n{{bar percent|Others|black|0.76}}\n| caption = Distribution of religions<br>\n{{small|Source: 2011 Census.}}\n}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Religion\n!Total\n!Percentage\n|-\n|[[Hinduism]]\n|1,608,921\n|76.89\n|-\n|[[Islam]]\n|442,355\n|21.14\n|-\n|[[Jainism]]\n|25,312\n|1.21\n|-\n|[[Sikhism]]\n|6,353\n|0.2\n|}\n\n*\n* A related Sarswat Brahmin are called Kutchi Sarswat Brahmin.

There are several sites related to the [[Indus valley civilization]] in the region, and it is mentioned in [[Hindu mythology]]. In historic times, Kutch is mentioned in Greek writings during [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]]. It was ruled by [[Menander I]] of [[Greco-Bactrian Kingdom]] which was overthrown by [[Indo-Scythians]] followed by [[Maurya Empire]] and [[Indo-Parthians|Saka]]s. In the first century, it was under [[Western Satraps]] followed by [[Gupta Empire]]. By the fifth century, [[Maitraka]] of [[Valabhi]] took over from which its close association with the ruling clans of Gujarat started. [[Chavda dynasty|Chavdas]] ruled the eastern and central parts by seventh century but came under [[Chaulukya dynasty|Chaulukya]]s by tenth century. After the fall of Chaulukya, [[Vaghela dynasty|Vaghela]]s ruled the state. Following the conquest of Sindh by Muslim rulers, the [[Samma tribe|Rajput Samma]] started moving southwards to Kutch and ruled the western regions initially. By the tenth century, they controlled a significant area of Kutch, and by the thirteenth century they controlled the whole of Kutch and adopted a new dynastic identity, [[Jadeja]].\n\nFor three centuries, Kutch was divided and ruled by three different branches of the Jadeja brothers. In the sixteenth century, Kutch was unified under one rule by Rao [[Khengarji I]] of these branches and his direct descendants ruled for two centuries and had a good relationship with [[Gujarat Sultanate]] and [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]]. One of his descendants, Rayadhan II, left three sons, of whom two died, and a third son, [[Pragmal Ji]] took over the state and founded the current lineage of rulers at the start of the seventeenth century. The descendants of the other brothers founded states in [[Kathiawar]]. After turbulent periods and battles with the armies of Sindh, the state was stabilized in the middle of the eighteenth century by a council known as [[Bar Bhayat ni Jamat]] who placed Rao as a titular head and ruled independently. The state accepted the sovereignty of the [[British East India Company]] in 1819, when Kutch was defeated in battle. The state was devastated by an [[1819 Rann of Kutch earthquake|earthquake in 1819]]. The state stabilized and flourished in business under subsequent rulers.\n\nUpon the [[independence of India]] in 1947, Kutch acceded unto the [[dominion of India]] and was constituted an independent [[commissionaire]]. It was created a [[states and territories of India|state]] within the [[union of India]] in 1950. The state witnessed an [[1956 Anjar earthquake|earthquake in 1956]]. On 1 November 1956, [[Kutch State]] was merged with [[Bombay state]], which in 1960 was divided into the new linguistic states of Gujarat and [[Maharashtra]], with Kutch becoming part of [[Gujarat]] state as Kutch district. The district was affected by tropical cyclone in 1998 and the [[2001 Gujarat earthquake|earthquake in 2001]]. The state saw rapid industrialization and growth in tourism in subsequent years.\n\n== Geography ==\nKutch District, at {{Convert|45691.895|sqkm|sqmi}}, is the largest district in India. The administrative headquarters is in [[Bhuj]] which is geographically in the center of district. Other main towns are [[Gandhidham]], [[Rapar]], [[Nakhatrana]], [[Anjar, India|Anjar]], [[Mandvi]], [[Madhapar]], [[Mundra]] and Bhachau. Kutch has 969 villages. Kala Dungar (Black Hill) is the highest point in Kutch at {{Convert|458|m|ft|0}}.\n[[File:A state highway through the Rann of Kutch.jpg|thumb|A state highway through the Rann of Kutch]]\nKutch is virtually an island, as it is surrounded by the [[Arabian Sea]] in the west; the [[Gulf of Kutch]] in south and southeast and [[Rann of Kutch]] in north and northeast. The border with Pakistan lies along the northern edge of the Rann of Kutch, of the [[Sir Creek]]. The Kutch peninsula is an example of active [[Thrust fault|fold and thrust]] [[tectonism]]. In Central Kutch there are four major east-west hill ranges characterized by [[Fault (geology)|fault propagation]] folds with steeply dipping northern limbs and gently dipping southern limbs. From the gradual increasing dimension of the linear chain of hillocks towards the west along the Kutch mainland [[Fault plane|fault]] and the [[epicentre]] of the earthquake of 2001 lying at the eastern extreme of Kutch mainland fault, it is suggested that the eastern part of the Kutch mainland fault is progressively emerging upward. It can be suggested from the absence of distinct [[surface rupture]] both during the [[1956 Anjar earthquake]] and [[2001 Bhuj earthquake]], that movements have taken place along a [[Blind thrust earthquake|blind thrust]]. Villages situated on the blind [[thrust]] in the eastern part of the Kutch mainland hill range (viz. Jawaharnagar, Khirsara, Devisar, Amarsar and Bandhdi) were completely erased during the 2001 earthquake.<ref name=\"karanth\">{{Cite journal |last1=Karanth |first1=R. V. |last2=Gadhavi |first2=M.

The script of the Kutchi language has become extinct. It is now mainly written in the Gujarati script. Samples of Kutch script are available in the [[Kutch Museum]]. The increased use of Gujarati language is mainly because of its being a medium of instruction in schools.\n\n=== People ===\n{{main|Kutchi people}}\n\nKutch district is inhabited by various groups and communities. One can find various nomadic, semi nomadic and artisan groups living in Kutch. [[Ahir]]s constitute a comparatively large group in Kutch.<ref>http://www.apnaorg.com/books/english/aboriginal-tribes/aboriginal-tribes.pdf</ref>\n\n=== Food and drink ===\n{{more citations needed section|date=November 2017}}\n[[File:Dhamakedar Dabeli.jpg|thumb|left|Kutchi Dabeli]]\n[[File:Kutchi thali.JPG|thumb|Kutchi thali]]\n\nThe majority of the population is [[Hindu]] and [[Jain]] and thus largely vegetarian. Jains also refrain from eating ''[[kandmool]]'' food grown below the ground such as [[potatoes]], [[garlic]], [[onion]], and [[Amorphophallus paeoniifolius|yam]]. There are also a sizeable population of Muslims, who eat vegetables, chicken, mutton and occasionally camels.\n\nIn the villages, staple foods include kadi-khichdi, [[Pearl millet|bajra]] and milk ; bajara na rotla with curd and buttermilk is very common food for all the Gujarati people. Bajra was introduced by a king of this region named Lakho Fulani. During his period of exile, he came to know about this grain in some tribal regions. They also extensively drink [[buttermilk]] during lunch. Milk is considered to be sacred food and offering it to somebody is considered a gesture of friendship and welcoming. Settlement of dispute invariably follows offering milk to each other as a concluding remark. In the Kutchi engagement ceremony, the bride's family offers milk to the groom's relatives as a symbol of accepting their relationship.\n\n[[Tea]] is the most popular drink in this region.\n\n== Economy ==\n[[File:Kandla Port.jpg|thumb|[[Kandla Port]]]]\nHistorically Kutch was always considered a backward region due to its location and submerged geography. The situation seemed to have worsened after the disastrous [[2001 Gujarat earthquake|Kutch earthquake]]. But in the next decade, the economy took an almost miraclous jumpstart due to the intense efforts of the Gujarat government. Kutch today is a growing economic and industrial hub in one of India's fastest growing states \u2013 Gujarat. Its location on the far western edge of India has resulted in the commissioning of two major ports Kandla and Mundra. These ports are near most to the Gulf and Europe by the sea route. The hinterland of north-western India hosts more than 50% of India's population.\n\nQuality of roads is good in Kutch. The large part of the growth of Kutch came after intense development by the state government as part of 2001 earthquake relief.\n\nDue to the existence of two major ports i.e. [[Kandla Port|Kandla]] and [[Mundra Port|Mundra]] transportation as a business has thrived. Since historical times the people of Kutch have formed the backbone of trade between Gujarat mainland and Sindh. After the formation of Pakistan this trade stopped for good, but due to the inception of the Kandla port, trade boomed again. Kandla port is also in Kutch. It is considered Gateway to India's North. It is managed by the Kandla Port trust.\n\n=== Mineral ===\n[[File:Lignite-coal.jpg|thumb|[[Lignite]]]]\nKutch is a mineral rich region with a very large reserve of [[Lignite]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hindu.com/fline/fl2006/stories/20030328007012200.htm|title=The brown gold of Kutch \u2013 By tapping the huge mineral deposits of the Kutch region, Gujarat Mineral Development Corporation Ltd. plans to turn the backward area into a prosperous one; SPECIAL FEATURE: GUJARAT; By V.K.

Adani Power expects to tie up funds for its 3300 MW plant by March 2012 and is on track to complete the installation of 10,000 MW projects by 2013.\n\n=== Forestry ===\nKutch district has a scanty forest cover. Hence there is negligible risk of illegal cutting of forests. This coupled with the adequate facilities available at Kandla port has helped establish the timber market. In 1987, \"Kandla Timber Association\" was formed in order to resolve the specific problems of timber importers and timber allied industries coming up during the period. The timber industry is growing at a faster pace with 300 saw mills working in Gandhidham-Kandla Complex.\n\n=== Salt ===\n[[File:Salt worker in Rann of Kutch.jpg|thumb|Salt worker in Rann of Kutch]]\nThe Little Rann of Kutch is known for its traditional salt production and various references mention this to be a 600-year-old activity. During the British period, this activity increased manifold. It was used to fund a substantial part of the military expenses of the British government.\n\nCommunities involved in salt production are mainly Chunvaliya Koli, Ahir and Miyana (Muslim), residing in 107 villages in the periphery of Lesser Rann of Kutch. These communities are traditionally known to have the skills of salt production and are known as 'Agariyas'. Water quality in 107 villages of Lesser Rann of Kutch is saline, thus agriculture is not an option. Hence salt production is the only livelihood option for Agariyas. As per the Salt Commission's report there are 45000 Agariyas working in the salt pans of Kutch. Out of the estimated total annual production of India of about 18&nbsp;million tonnes, Gujarat contributes 75% \u2013 mainly from Kutch and other parts of Saurashtra.\n\n=== Textile Art ===\n[[File:Antique Kutch Embroidery.jpg|thumb|right|An example of Kutch Embroidery \u2013 Antique Dowry Bag]]\n[[File:Ajrak.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ajrak]]]]\nKutch is one of the most prolific regions in India in the area of textile art. Kutch embroidery is dense with motifs, and a variation with mirrors sewn into the embroidery is one of the signature arts of this region.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nWithin the category of Kutch embroidery there are several sub-categories as each tribe and sub-tribe produces a unique signature form of art.\n\nKutch embroidery is an evolving expression of the craft and textile traditions of the Rabaris, a nomadic tribe in Gujarat. Kutch embroidery is unique in the sense that a net is woven on a cloth using thread.The net is then filled in using the same thread by intricate interlocking stitches. The patterns are usually built around geometric shapes.This embroidery follows its own traditional design logic and juxtaposition of colours and motifs. The Rohanas tribals of Kutch specialise in skirt work. The Sodhas use a geometric style for their embroidery. The Garacia Jats are experts in tiny embroidery on the yoke, which intermingles with red, orange, blue and green threads. The Dhanetah Jats love embroidering broad pear-shaped mirrors using orange, black, yellow and red in chain stitch.\n\n== Religion ==\n{{bar box\n| title    = Religions in Kutch District\n| titlebar = #FCD116\n| left1    = Religion\n| right1   = Percent\n| float    = right\n| bars     = \n{{bar percent|[[Hindus|Hindu]]|orange|76.89}}\n{{bar percent|[[Muslims|Muslim]]|green|21.14}}\n{{bar percent|[[Jainism|Jain]]|pink|1.21}}\n{{bar percent|Others|black|0.76}}\n| caption = Distribution of religions<br>\n{{small|Source: 2011 Census.}}\n}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Religion\n!Total\n!Percentage\n|-\n|[[Hinduism]]\n|1,608,921\n|76.89\n|-\n|[[Islam]]\n|442,355\n|21.14\n|-\n|[[Jainism]]\n|25,312\n|1.21\n|-\n|[[Sikhism]]\n|6,353\n|0.2\n|}\n\n*\n* A related Sarswat Brahmin are called Kutchi Sarswat Brahmin.
