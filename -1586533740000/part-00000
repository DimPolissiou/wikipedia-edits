The title refers to the [[pulp magazine]]s and [[hardboiled]] crime novels popular during the mid-20th century, known for their graphic violence and punchy dialogue.\n\nTarantino wrote ''Pulp Fiction'' in 1992 and 1993, incorporating scenes that Avary originally wrote for ''[[True Romance]]'' (1993). Its plot occurs [[Nonlinear narrative|out of chronological order]]. The film is also [[self-reference|self-referential]] from its opening moments, beginning with a [[Intertitle|title card]] that gives two dictionary definitions of \"pulp\". Considerable screen time is devoted to monologues and casual conversations with eclectic dialogue revealing each character's perspectives on several subjects, and the film features an [[Irony|ironic]] combination of humor and strong violence. [[TriStar Pictures]] reportedly turned down the script as \"too demented\". [[Miramax]] co-chairman [[Harvey Weinstein]] was enthralled, however, and the film became the first that Miramax fully financed.\n\n''Pulp Fiction'' won the [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[1994 Cannes Film Festival]], and was a major critical and commercial success. It was nominated for seven awards at the [[67th Academy Awards]], including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], and won [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]]; it earned Travolta, Jackson, and Thurman Academy Award nominations and boosted their careers.

It finally returns to where it began, in the diner. There is a total of seven narrative sequences; the three primary storylines are preceded by intertitles:\n# \"Prologue&nbsp;\u2013 The Diner\" (i)\n# Prelude to \"Vincent Vega and Marsellus Wallace's Wife\"\n# \"Vincent Vega and Marsellus Wallace's Wife\"\n# Prelude to \"The Gold Watch\" (a&nbsp;\u2013 flashback, b&nbsp;\u2013 present)\n# \"The Gold Watch\"\n# \"The Bonnie Situation\"\n# \"Epilogue&nbsp;\u2013 The Diner\" (ii)\n\nIf the seven sequences were ordered chronologically, they would run: 4a, 2, 6, 1, 7, 4b, 3, 5. Sequences 1 and 7 partially overlap and are presented from different points of view, as do sequences 2 and 6. According to Philip Parker, the structural form is \"an episodic narrative with circular events adding a beginning and end and allowing references to elements of each separate episode to be made throughout the narrative\".<ref>Parker (2002), p. 23.</ref> Other analysts describe the structure as a \"circular narrative\".<ref>See, e.g., Dancyger (2002), p. 235; {{cite web |last=Villella |first=Fiona A. |title=Circular Narratives: Highlights of Popular Cinema in the '90s |url=http://archive.sensesofcinema.com/contents/00/3/circular.html#b2 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061231115331/http://www.sensesofcinema.com/contents/00/3/circular.html#b2 |archivedate=2006-12-31 |work=Senses of Cinema |date=January 2000 |access-date=2006-12-31}}</ref>\n\n=== Summary ===\n<!-- Plot length should be 400-700 words. See WP:FILMPLOT. -->\nHitmen Jules Winnfield and Vincent Vega arrive at an apartment to retrieve a briefcase for their boss, gangster Marsellus Wallace, from a business partner, Brett. After Vincent checks the contents of the briefcase, Jules shoots one of Brett's associates, then declaims a passage from the Bible before he and Vincent kill Brett for trying to double-cross Marsellus. They take the briefcase to Marsellus, but have to wait while he bribes champion boxer Butch Coolidge to [[Match fixing|take a dive]] in his upcoming match.\n\nThe next day, Vincent purchases [[heroin]] from his drug dealer, Lance. He shoots up, then drives to meet Marsellus's wife Mia, whom he had agreed to escort while Marsellus was out of town. They eat at a 1950s-themed restaurant and participate in a [[Twist (dance)|twist]] contest, then return home with the trophy. While Vincent is in the bathroom, Mia finds his heroin, mistakes it for [[cocaine]], snorts it, and overdoses. Vincent rushes her to Lance's house, where they revive her with an adrenalin shot to her heart.\n\nButch betrays Marsellus and wins the bout, accidentally killing his opponent. At the motel where he and his girlfriend Fabienne are lying low and preparing to flee, Butch discovers she has forgotten to pack his father's gold watch, a beloved heirloom, and flies into a rage. Returning to his apartment to retrieve the watch, he notices a suppressed [[MAC-10]] on the kitchen counter and hears the toilet flush. Vincent exits the bathroom and Butch shoots him dead, leaving the gun inside.\n\nAs Butch waits at a traffic light in his car, Marsellus spots him by chance crossing the road and chases him into a pawnshop. The owner, Maynard, captures them at gunpoint and ties them up in the basement. Maynard is joined by Zed, a security guard; they take Marsellus to another room to rape him, leaving \"the gimp\", a silent figure in a [[bondage suit]], to watch Butch. Butch breaks loose and knocks out the gimp. He is about to flee but decides to save Marsellus, returning with a [[katana]] from the pawnshop. He kills Maynard; Marsellus retrieves Maynard's shotgun and shoots Zed. Marsellus informs Butch that they are even, as long as he tells no-one about the rape and departs Los Angeles forever. Butch picks up Fabienne on Zed's [[Chopper (motorcycle)|chopper]] and they drive away.\n\nEarlier, after Vincent and Jules have executed Brett in his apartment, another man bursts out of the bathroom and shoots at them wildly, missing every time; Jules and Vincent kill him. Jules professes their survival was a miracle, which Vincent disputes. As Jules drives, Vincent accidentally shoots Brett's associate Marvin in the head. They hide the car at the home of Jules' friend Jimmie, who demands they deal with the problem before his wife comes home. Marsellus sends his [[Cleaner (crime)|cleaner]], Winston Wolfe, who directs Jules and Vincent to clean the car, hide the body in the trunk, dispose of their bloody clothes, and take the car to a junkyard.\n\nAt a diner, Jules tells Vincent that he plans to retire from his life of crime, convinced that their \"miraculous\" survival at the apartment was a sign of [[miracle|divine intervention]]. While Vincent is in the bathroom, a couple dubbed \"Pumpkin\" and \"Honey Bunny\" hold up the restaurant. Jules overpowers Pumpkin and holds him at gunpoint; Honey Bunny becomes hysterical and trains her gun on him. Vincent returns with his gun aimed at her. Jules recites the biblical passage, expresses ambivalence about his life of crime, and allows the robbers to take his cash and leave. Jules and Vincent leave the diner with the briefcase.\n\n==Cast==<!-- Other articles link here -->\n<!-- Cast per opening credits order. -->\n* [[John Travolta]] as Vincent Vega:\n:Jules' partner-in-crime, working for Marsellus Wallace.

In 1995, in a special edition of ''[[At the Movies (1986 TV program)|Siskel & Ebert]]'' devoted to Tarantino, [[Gene Siskel]] argued that the work posed a major challenge to the \"ossification of American movies with their brutal formulas\". In Siskel's view,\n\n<blockquote>\nthe violent intensity of ''Pulp Fiction'' calls to mind other violent watershed films that were considered classics in their time and still are. [[Alfred Hitchcock|Hitchcock]]'s ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' [1960], [[Arthur Penn]]'s ''[[Bonnie and Clyde (film)|Bonnie and Clyde]]'' [1967], and [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s ''[[A Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange]]'' [1971]. Each film shook up a tired, bloated movie industry and used a world of lively lowlifes to reflect how dull other movies had become. And that, I predict, will be the ultimate honor for ''Pulp Fiction''. Like all great films, it criticizes other movies.<ref name=\"SE\">\"Pulp Faction: The Tarantino Generation\", ''Siskel & Ebert'', ''Pulp Fiction'' DVD (Buena Vista Home Entertainment).</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nKen Dancyger writes that its \"imitative and innovative style\"&nbsp;\u2013 like that of its predecessor, ''[[Reservoir Dogs]]''&nbsp;\u2013 represents\n\n<blockquote>\na new phenomenon, the movie whose style is created from the context of movie life rather than real life. The consequence is twofold&nbsp;\u2013 the presumption of deep knowledge on the part of the audience of those forms such as the [[gangster film]]s or Westerns, horror films or adventure films.

[It] celebrates interracial friendship and cultural diversity; there are strong women and strong black men, and the director swims against the current of class stereotype.\"<ref name=\"Stone\" />\n\nWhere Stone sees a celebration, Kolker finds a vacuum: \"The postmodern insouciance, violence, homophobia, and racism of ''Pulp Fiction'' were perfectly acceptable because the film didn't pretend seriousness and therefore didn't mock it.\"<ref name=\"K281\" /> Calling it the \"acme of postmodern nineties filmmaking\", he explains, \"the postmodern is about surfaces; it is flattened spatiality in which event and character are in a steady state of reminding us that they are pop-cultural figures.\"<ref>Kolker (2000), pp. 249, 250.</ref> According to Kolker:\n\n<blockquote>\nThat's why ''Pulp Fiction'' was so popular. Not because all audiences got all or any of its references to Scorsese and Kubrick, but because the narrative and spatial structure of the film never threatened to go beyond themselves into signification. The film's cycle of racist and homophobic jokes might threaten to break out into a quite nasty view of the world, but this nastiness keeps being laughed off&nbsp;\u2014 by the mock intensity of the action, the prowling, confronting, perverse, confined, and airless nastiness of the world Tarantino creates.<ref name=\"K250\">Kolker (2000), p. 250.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n[[Henry Giroux|Henry A. Giroux]] argues that Tarantino \"empties violence of any critical social consequences, offering viewers only the immediacy of shock, humor, and irony-without-insight as elements of mediation. None of these elements gets beyond the seduction of voyeuristic gazing&nbsp;... [t]he facile consumption of shocking images and hallucinatory delight.\"<ref>Giroux (1996), p. 77.</ref>\n\nRegarding the violence and nihilism in the film, Pamela Demory has suggested that ''Pulp Fiction'' should be seen in light of the short stories of [[Flannery O'Connor]],<ref>[Pamela H. Demory, \"Violence and Transcendence in ''Pulp Fiction'' and Flannery O'Connor\" in ''The Image of Violence in Literature, the Media, and Society: Selected Papers [from the] 1995 Conference [of the] Society for the Interdisciplinary Study of Social Imagery'', ed. and intro., Will Wright and Steven Kaplan (Pueblo, Co.: Society for the Interdisciplinary Study of Social Imagery, 1995): 187-194.]</ref> which likewise feature \"religious elements, banality, and violence with grotesque humor.\" Discussing \"the connection between violence and redemption,\" Demory concludes that while O'Connor's purpose is to convince readers \"of the powerful force of evil in the world and of our need for grace,\" Tarantino \"seeks to demonstrate that in spite of everything we have seen in the film&nbsp;\u2014 all the violence, degradation, death, crime, amoral behavior&nbsp;\u2014 grace is still possible; there might be still be a God who doesn't judge us on merits.\"<ref>[Quoted in ''Flannery O'Connor: An Annotated Reference Guide to Criticism'', ed. R. Neil Scott (Milledgeville, Georgia: Timberlane Books, 2002), p. 185]</ref>\n\n=== Homage as essence ===\n==== Cinema ====\n''Pulp Fiction'' is full of [[Homage (arts)|homages]] to other movies. \"Tarantino's characters\", writes [[Gary Groth]], \"inhabit a world where the entire landscape is composed of Hollywood product. Tarantino is a cinematic kleptomaniac&nbsp;\u2013 he literally can't help himself.\"<ref>Groth (1997), p. 189.</ref> Two scenes in particular have prompted discussion of the film's highly [[Intertextuality|intertextual]] style. Many have assumed that the dance sequence at Jack Rabbit Slim's was intended as a reference to Travolta's star-making performance as Tony Manero in the epochal ''[[Saturday Night Fever]]'' (1977); Tarantino, however, credits a scene in the [[Jean-Luc Godard]] film ''[[Bande \u00e0 part (film)|Bande \u00e0 part]]'' (1964) with the inspiration. According to the filmmaker;\n\n<blockquote>\nEverybody thinks that I wrote this scene just to have John Travolta dancing. But the scene existed before John Travolta was cast. But once he was cast, it was like, \"Great. We get to see John dance. All the better.\"...&nbsp;My favorite musical sequences have always been in Godard, because they just come out of nowhere. It's so infectious, so friendly. And the fact that it's not a musical, but he's stopping the movie to have a musical sequence, makes it all the more sweet.<ref name=\"T9\">Enhanced Trivia Track, ch. 9, ''Pulp Fiction'' DVD (Buena Vista Home Entertainment).</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n[[Jerome Charyn]] argues that, beyond \"all the better\", Travolta's presence is essential to the power of the scene, and of the film:\n\n<blockquote>\nTravolta's entire career becomes \"[[backstory]]\", the myth of a movie star who has fallen out of favor, but still resides in our memory as the king of disco. We keep waiting for him to shed his paunch, put on a white polyester suit, and enter the 2001 Odyssey club in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, where he will dance for us and never, never stop. Daniel Day-Lewis couldn't have woken such a powerful longing in us. He isn't part of America's own mad cosmology&nbsp;... Tony Manero [is] an angel sitting on Vince's shoulder&nbsp;... [Vince and Mia's] actual dance may be closer to the choreography of [[Anna Karina]]'s shuffle with her two bumbling gangster boyfriends in ''Bande \u00e0 part'', but even ''that'' reference is lost to us, and we're with Tony again&nbsp;...<ref>Charyn (2006), p. 106.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nEstella Tincknell notes that while the \"diner setting seems to be a simulacrum of a 'fifties' restaurant&nbsp;... the twist contest is a musical sequence which evokes 'the sixties,' while Travolta's dance performance inevitably references 'the seventies' and his appearance in ''Saturday Night Fever.'' ...&nbsp;The 'past' thus becomes a more general 'pastness' in which the stylistic signifiers of various decades are loaded in to a single moment.\"<ref name=\"T\">Tincknell (2006), p. 140.</ref> She also argues that in this passage the film \"briefly shifts from its habitually ironic discourse to one that references the conventions of the classic [[Musical film|film musical]] and in doing so makes it possible for the film to inhabit an affective space that goes beyond stylistic allusion.\"<ref name=\"T\" />\n\nThe pivotal moment in which Marsellus crosses the street in front of Butch's car and notices him evokes the scene in which Marion Crane's boss sees her under similar circumstances in ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' (1960).<ref>Dawson (1995), p. 178; Polan (2000), p. 19.</ref> Marsellus and Butch are soon held captive by Maynard and Zed, \"two sadistic honkies straight out of ''[[Deliverance]]''\" (1972), directed by [[John Boorman]].<ref name=\"Stone\" /> Zed shares a name with [[Sean Connery]]'s character in Boorman's follow-up, the science-fiction film ''[[Zardoz]]'' (1974). When Butch decides to rescue Marsellus, in Glyn White's words, \"he finds a trove of items with film-hero resonances\".<ref name=\"W\">White (2002), p. 342.</ref> Critics have identified these weapons with a range of possible allusions:\n* Hammer&nbsp;\u2014 ''[[The Toolbox Murders]]'' (1978)<ref name=\"F\">Fulwood (2003), p. 22.</ref>\n* Baseball bat&nbsp;\u2014 ''[[Walking Tall (1973 film)|Walking Tall]]'' (1973);<ref name=\"W\" /> ''[[The Untouchables (film)|The Untouchables]]'' (1987)<ref name=\"F\" />\n* Chainsaw&nbsp;\u2014 ''[[The Texas Chain Saw Massacre]]'' (1974);<ref name=\"W\" /><ref name=\"F\" /> ''[[Evil Dead II]]'' (1987)<ref name=\"W\" />\n* [[Katana]] (samurai sword)&nbsp;\u2014 many, including ''[[Seven Samurai]]'' (1954);<ref name=\"W\" /><ref name=\"F\" /> ''[[The Yakuza]]'' (1975);<ref name=\"W\" /> ''[[Shogun Assassin]]'' (1980)<ref name=\"F\" />\n\nAt the conclusion of the scene, a portentous line of Marsellus' echoes one from the crime drama ''[[Charley Varrick]]'' (1973), directed by another of Tarantino's heroes, [[Don Siegel]]; the name of the character who speaks it there is Maynard.<ref>Groth (1997), pp. 188\u20139; Dinshaw (1997), p. 186; Mottram (2006), pp. 75\u201376. For Tarantino's admiration of Siegel, see Dawson (1995), p. 142.</ref>\n\nDavid Bell argues that far from going against the \"current of class stereotype\", this scene, like ''Deliverance'', \"mobilize[s] a certain construction of poor white country folk&nbsp;\u2014 and particularly their sexualization&nbsp;... 'rustic sexual expression often takes the form of homosexual rape' in American movies.\"<ref>Bell (2000), p. 87.</ref> Stephen Paul Miller believes the ''Pulp Fiction'' scene goes down much easier than the one it echoes: \"The buggery perpetrated is not at all as shocking as it was in ''Deliverance''&nbsp;... The nineties film reduces seventies competition, horror, and taboo into an entertainingly subtle adrenaline play&nbsp;\u2014 a fiction, a pulp fiction.\"<ref>Miller (1999), p. 76.</ref> Giroux reads the rape scene homage similarly: \"in the end Tarantino's use of parody is about repetition, transgression, and softening the face of violence by reducing it to the property of film history.\"<ref>Giroux (1996), p. 78.</ref> In Groth's view, the crucial difference is that \"in ''Deliverance'' the rape created the film's central moral dilemma whereas in ''Pulp Fiction'' it was merely 'the single weirdest day of [Butch's] life.'\"<ref>Groth (1997), p. 188.</ref> (\"''[[American Me]]'' did it too,\" Tarantino observed. \"There's like ''three'' butt-fucking scenes in ''American Me''. That's definitely the one to beat in that particular category!\"<ref>[[Rolling Stone]], November 3, 1994, p110</ref>)\n\nNeil Fulwood focuses on Butch's weapon selection, writing, \"Here, Tarantino's love of movies is at its most open and nonjudgemental, tipping a nod to the noble and the notorious, as well as sending up his own reputation as an [[enfant terrible]] of movie violence. Moreover, the scene makes a sly comment about the readiness of cinema to seize upon whatever is to hand for its moments of mayhem and murder.\"<ref name=\"F\" /> White asserts that \"the katana he finally, and significantly, selects identifies him with&nbsp;... [[honour]]able heroes.\"<ref name=\"W\" /> Conard argues that the first three items symbolize a nihilism that Butch is rejecting. The traditional Japanese sword, in contrasts, represents a culture with a well-defined [[Morality|moral code]] and thus connects Butch with a more meaningful approach to life.<ref>Conard (2006), pp. 125, 133.</ref>\n\n==== Television ====\nRobert Miklitsch argues that \"Tarantino's telephilia\" may be more central to the guiding sensibility of ''Pulp Fiction'' than the filmmaker's love for rock 'n' roll and even cinema:\n\n<blockquote>\nTalking about his generation, one that came of age in the '70s, Tarantino has commented that the \"number one thing we all shared wasn't music, that was a Sixties thing. Our culture was television.\" A random list of the TV programs referenced in ''Pulp Fiction'' confirms his observation: ''[[Speed Racer]], [[Clutch Cargo]], [[The Brady Bunch]], [[The Partridge Family]], [[The Avengers (TV series)|The Avengers]], [[The Three Stooges]], [[The Flintstones]], [[I Spy (1965 TV series)|I Spy]], [[Green Acres]], [[Kung Fu (TV series)|Kung Fu]], [[Happy Days]]'', and last but not least, Mia's fictional pilot, ''Fox Force Five''.<ref>Miklitsch, pp. 15, 16. Note that while the Three Stooges did have an original TV series that ran briefly in the mid-1960s, they were most familiar from their cinematic [[Short film|shorts]] that were [[Broadcast syndication|syndicated]] to television.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n\"The above list, with the possible exception of ''The Avengers'',\" writes Miklitsch, \"suggests that ''Pulp Fiction'' has less of an elective affinity with the cinematic avant-gardism of Godard than with mainstream network programming.\"<ref name=\"M16\">Miklitsch, p. 16.</ref> Jonathan Rosenbaum had brought TV into his analysis of the Tarantino/Godard comparison, acknowledging that the directors were similar in wanting to cram everything they like onscreen: \"But the differences between what Godard likes and what Tarantino likes and why are astronomical; it's like comparing a combined museum, library, film archive, record shop, and department store with a jukebox, a video-rental outlet, and an issue of ''[[TV Guide]]''.\"<ref name=\"JR\" />\n\nSharon Willis focuses on the way a television show (''[[Clutch Cargo]]'') marks the beginning of, and plays on through, the scene between young Butch and his father's comrade-in-arms. The Vietnam War veteran is played by Christopher Walken, whose presence in the role evokes his performance as a traumatized G.I. in the Vietnam War movie ''[[The Deer Hunter]]'' (1978). Willis writes that \"when Captain Koons enters the living room, we see Walken in his function as an image retrieved from a repertoire of 1970s television and movie versions of ruined [[masculinity]] in search of rehabilitation&nbsp;... [T]he gray light of the television presiding over the scene seems to inscribe the ghostly paternal gaze.\"<ref name=\"Willis\">Willis (1997), p. 195.</ref> Miklitsch asserts that, for some critics, the film is a \"prime example of the pernicious ooze-like influence of mass culture exemplified by their b\u00eate noire: TV.\"<ref name=\"M16\" /> Kolker might not disagree, arguing that \"''Pulp Fiction'' is a simulacrum of our daily exposure to television; its homophobes, thugs and perverts, sentimental boxers and pimp promoters move through a series of long-take tableaux: we watch, laugh, and remain with nothing to comprehend.\"<ref name=\"K250\" />\n\n=== Notable motifs ===\n\n==== The mysterious 666 briefcase ====\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction = vertical\n| width     = 200\n| image1    = PulpFictionCase.jpg\n| caption1  =Vincent \"stares&nbsp;... transfixed\" into the glowing case, as specified in Tarantino's screenplay.<ref>Tarantino (1994), p. 28.</ref>\n\n| image2    = KissMeDeadlyPandora.jpg\n| caption2  = Vincent's demeanor reinforces the allusion to the scene in ''[[Kiss Me Deadly]]'' (1955) in which Lily Carver, a.k.a.

Tarantino has said there is no explanation for its contents&nbsp;\u2013 it is simply a [[MacGuffin]], a pure [[plot device]]. Originally, the case was to contain diamonds, but this was seen as too mundane. For filming purposes, it contained a hidden orange light bulb that produced an otherworldly glow when the case was opened.<ref>{{cite web|title=What's In the Briefcase?|url=http://www.snopes.com/movies/films/pulp.htm|website=Snopes.com|date=2007-08-17|access-date=2007-09-13}}</ref> In a 2007 video interview with fellow director and friend [[Robert Rodriguez]], Tarantino purportedly \"reveals\" the secret contents of the briefcase, but the film cuts out and skips the scene in the style employed in Tarantino and Rodriguez's ''[[Grindhouse (film)|Grindhouse]]'' (2007), with an intertitle that reads \"Missing Reel\". The interview resumes with Rodriguez discussing how radically the \"knowledge\" of the briefcase's contents alters one's understanding of the movie.<ref name=\"Myspace\">{{cite web|title=Rodriguez and Tarantino: Artist On Artist|url=http://creative.myspace.com/groups/_mh/aoa/pages/qtarantino_rrodriguez/qtarantino_rrodriguez.html|publisher=MySpace.com|date=April 6, 2007|access-date=2007-09-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130120090140/http://creative.myspace.com/groups/_mh/aoa/pages/qtarantino_rrodriguez/qtarantino_rrodriguez.html|archive-date=January 20, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nDespite Tarantino's statements, many solutions to what one scholar calls this \"unexplained postmodern puzzle\" have been proposed.<ref name=\"Real\" /> A strong similarity has often been observed with the 1955 [[film noir]] ''[[Kiss Me Deadly]]''.

Analyzing the notion, [[Roger Ebert]] dismissed it as \"nothing more than a widely distributed urban legend given false credibility by the mystique of the Net\".<ref>Ebert 1997, p. 188.</ref>\n\n==== Jules' Bible passage ====\nJules ritually recites what he describes as a biblical passage, [[Book of Ezekiel|Ezekiel]] 25:17, before he executes someone. The passage is heard three times&nbsp;\u2013 in the introductory sequence in which Jules and Vincent reclaim Marsellus' briefcase from the doomed Brett; that same recitation a second time, at the beginning of \"The Bonnie Situation\", which overlaps the end of the earlier sequence; and in the epilogue at the diner. The first version of the passage is as follows:\n\n<blockquote>The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the iniquities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he who in the name of charity and goodwill shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy My brothers. And you will know My name is the Lord when I lay My vengeance upon thee.</blockquote>\n\nThe second version, from the diner scene, is identical except for the final line: \"And you will know I am the Lord when I lay my vengeance upon you.\"\n\n{{listen|filename=End of Ezekiel.ogg|title=\"And I will strike down&nbsp;...\"| description= Conclusion of the \"Ezekiel 25:17\" monologue and Brett's murder}}\n\nWhile the final two sentences of Jules' speech are similar to the actual cited passage, the first two are fabricated from various biblical phrases.<ref>Reinhartz (2003), p. 108.</ref> The text of Ezekiel 25 preceding verse 17 indicates that God's wrath is retribution for the hostility of the [[Philistines]]. In the [[King James Version]] from which Jules' speech is adapted, Ezekiel 25:17 reads in its entirety:\n\n<blockquote>And I will execute great vengeance upon them with furious rebukes; and they shall know that I ''am'' the LORD, when I shall lay My vengeance upon them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/108/26/25.html|title=The Book of the Prophet Ezekiel, 25|work=The Holy Bible: King James Version|access-date=2007-09-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100131052531/http://www.bartleby.com/108/26/25.html|archive-date=January 31, 2010|url-status=live}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nTarantino's primary inspiration for the speech was the work of Japanese [[martial arts film|martial arts]] star [[Sonny Chiba]]. Its text and its identification as Ezekiel 25:17 derive from an almost identical creed that appears at the beginning of the Chiba movie ''[[Karate Kiba]]'' (''The Bodyguard''; 1976), where it is both shown as a scrolling text and read by an offscreen narrator.<ref>Thomas (2003) notes that instead of \"the Lord\", this version reads \"...&nbsp;and they shall know that I am Chiba the Bodyguard&nbsp;...\" (pp. 61\u201362). Conard (2006) claims that the text originates from the film ''Bodigaado Kiba'' (''Bodyguard Kiba'' or ''The Bodyguard''; 1973) and that the end phrase there is \"And you will know my name is Chiba the Bodyguard&nbsp;...\" (p. 135, n. 4).</ref>\n\nThe version seen at the beginning of ''The Bodyguard (1976)'' is as follows:\n\n<blockquote>The path of the righteous man and defender is beset on all sides by the iniquity of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he, who in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper, and the father of lost children. And I will execute great vengeance upon them with furious anger, who poison and destroy my brothers; and they shall know that I am Chiba the Bodyguard when I shall lay my vengeance upon them!</blockquote>\n\nIn the 1980s television series ''Kage no Gundan'' (''[[Shadow Warriors (TV series)|Shadow Warriors]]''), Chiba's character would lecture the villain-of-the-week about how the world must be rid of evil before killing him.<ref>Enhanced Trivia Track, ch. 4, ''Pulp Fiction'' DVD (Buena Vista Home Entertainment).</ref> A killer delivers a similar biblical rant in ''[[Modesty Blaise (novel)|Modesty Blaise]]'', the hardback but pulp-style novel Vincent is shown with in two scenes.<ref name=\"T25\">Enhanced Trivia Track, ch. 25, ''Pulp Fiction'' DVD (Buena Vista Home Entertainment).</ref>\n\nTwo critics who have analyzed the role of the speech find different ties between Jules' transformation and the issue of [[postmodernity]]. Gormley argues that unlike the film's other major characters&nbsp;\u2013 Marsellus aside&nbsp;\u2013 Jules is:\n\n<blockquote>\nlinked to a \"thing\" beyond postmodern simulation&nbsp;... [T]his is perhaps most marked when he moves on from being a simulation of a Baptist preacher, spouting Ezekiel because it was \"just a cool thing to say&nbsp;...\" In his conversion, Jules is shown to be cognizant of a place beyond this simulation, which, in this case, the film constructs as God.<ref>Gormley (2005), p. 167.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n[[Adele Reinhartz]] writes that the \"depth of Jules's transformation\" is indicated by the difference in his two deliveries of the passage: \"In the first, he is a majestic and awe-inspiring figure, proclaiming the prophecy with fury and self-righteousness&nbsp;... In the second&nbsp;... he appears to be a different sort of man altogether&nbsp;... [I]n true postmodern fashion, [he] reflects on the meaning of his speech and provides several different ways that it might pertain to his current situation.\"<ref>Reinhartz (2003), pp. 106, 107.</ref> Similar to Gormley, Conard argues that as Jules reflects on the passage, it dawns on him \"that it refers to an objective framework of value and meaning that is absent from his life\"; to Conard, this contrasts with the film's prevalent representation of a nihilistic culture.<ref>Conard (2006), p. 130.</ref> Rosenbaum finds much less in Jules's revelation: \"[T]he [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|spiritual awakening]] at the end of ''Pulp Fiction'', which Jackson performs beautifully, is a piece of jive avowedly inspired by kung-fu movies. It may make you feel good, but it certainly doesn't leave you any wiser.\"<ref>Rosenbaum, Jonathan. \"Allusion Profusion (''Ed Wood, Pulp Fiction'')\", ''Chicago Reader'', October 21, 1994. Note that the avowed inspiration is actually a TV show, ''Kung Fu''.</ref>\n\n==== The bathroom ====\nMuch of ''Pulp Fiction''{{'}}s action revolves around characters who are either in the bathroom or need to use the toilet. To a lesser extent, Tarantino's other films also feature this narrative element.<ref>{{cite web |author1=White, Mike |author2=Mike Thompson |lastauthoramp=yes |work=Cashiers du Cinemart |title=Tarantino in a Can? |url=http://www.impossiblefunky.com/archives/issue_2/2_toilet.asp?IshNum=2&Headline=Tarantino%20In%20The%20Can |date=Spring 1995 |access-date=2006-12-31 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120211214336/http://www.impossiblefunky.com/archives/issue_2/2_toilet.asp?IshNum=2&Headline=Tarantino%20In%20The%20Can |archivedate=2012-02-11}}</ref> At Jack Rabbit Slim's, Mia goes to \"powder her nose\"&nbsp;\u2013 literally; she [[Cocaine#Insufflation|snorts coke]] in the restroom, surrounded by a bevy of women vainly primping. Butch and Fabienne play an extended scene in their motel bathroom, he in the shower, she brushing her teeth; the next morning, but just a few seconds later in screen time, she is again brushing her teeth. As Jules and Vincent confront Brett and two of his pals, a fourth man is hiding in the bathroom&nbsp;\u2013 his actions will lead to Jules' transformative \"moment of clarity\". After Marvin's absurd death, Vincent and Jules wash up in Jimmie's bathroom, where they get into a contretemps over a bloody hand towel.<ref name=\"Den\" /> When the diner hold-up turns into a [[Mexican standoff]], \"Honey Bunny\" whines, \"I gotta go pee!\"<ref name=\"F15\">Fraiman (2003), p. 15.</ref>\n\nAs described by Peter and Will Brooker, \"In three significant moments Vincent retires to the bathroom [and] returns to an utterly changed world where death is threatened.\"<ref name=\"B&B\">Brooker and Brooker (1996), p. 239.</ref> The threat increases in magnitude as the narrative progresses chronologically, and is realized in the third instance:\n\n# Vincent and Jules' diner breakfast and philosophical conversation is aborted by Vincent's bathroom break; an armed robbery ensues while Vincent is reading on the toilet.\n# While Vincent is in the bathroom worrying about the possibility of going too far with Marsellus' wife, Mia mistakes his heroin for cocaine, snorts it, and overdoses.\n# During a stakeout at Butch's apartment, Vincent emerges from the toilet with his book and is killed by Butch.\n\nIn the Brookers' analysis, \"Through Vince&nbsp;... we see the contemporary world as utterly contingent, transformed, disastrously, in the instant you are not looking.\"<ref name=\"B&B\" /> Fraiman finds it particularly significant that Vincent is reading ''Modesty Blaise'' in two of these instances. She links this fact with the traditional derisive view of women as \"the archetypal consumers of pulp\":\n\n<blockquote>\nLocating popular fiction in the bathroom, Tarantino reinforces its association with shit, already suggested by the dictionary meanings of \"pulp\" that preface the movie: moist, shapeless matter; also, lurid stories on cheap paper. What we have then is a series of damaging associations&nbsp;\u2013 pulp, women, shit&nbsp;\u2013 that taint not only male producers of mass-market fiction but also male consumers. Perched on the toilet with his book, Vincent is feminized by sitting instead of standing as well as by his trashy tastes; preoccupied by the anal, he is implicitly infantilized and homosexualized; and the seemingly inevitable result is being pulverized by Butch with a Czech M61 submachine gun. That this fate has to do with Vincent's reading habits is strongly suggested by a slow tilt from the book on the floor directly up to the corpse spilled into the tub.<ref>Fraiman (2003), p. 14.

The title refers to the [[pulp magazine]]s and [[hardboiled]] crime novels popular during the mid-20th century, known for their graphic violence and punchy dialogue.\n\nTarantino wrote ''Pulp Fiction'' in 1992 and 1993, incorporating scenes that Avary originally wrote for ''[[True Romance]]'' (1993). Its plot occurs [[Nonlinear narrative|out of chronological order]]. The film is also [[self-reference|self-referential]] from its opening moments, beginning with a [[Intertitle|title card]] that gives two dictionary definitions of \"pulp\". Considerable screen time is devoted to monologues and casual conversations with eclectic dialogue revealing each character's perspectives on several subjects, and the film features an [[Irony|ironic]] combination of humor and strong violence. [[TriStar Pictures]] reportedly turned down the script as \"too demented\". [[Miramax]] co-chairman [[Harvey Weinstein]] was enthralled, however, and the film became the first that Miramax fully financed.\n\n''Pulp Fiction'' won the [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[1994 Cannes Film Festival]], and was a major critical and commercial success. It was nominated for seven awards at the [[67th Academy Awards]], including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], and won [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]]; it earned Travolta, Jackson, and Thurman Academy Award nominations and boosted their careers.

It finally returns to where it began, in the diner. There is a total of seven narrative sequences; the three primary storylines are preceded by intertitles:\n# \"Prologue&nbsp;\u2013 The Diner\" (i)\n# Prelude to \"Vincent Vega and Marsellus Wallace's Wife\"\n# \"Vincent Vega and Marsellus Wallace's Wife\"\n# Prelude to \"The Gold Watch\" (a&nbsp;\u2013 flashback, b&nbsp;\u2013 present)\n# \"The Gold Watch\"\n# \"The Bonnie Situation\"\n# \"Epilogue&nbsp;\u2013 The Diner\" (ii)\n\nIf the seven sequences were ordered chronologically, they would run: 4a, 2, 6, 1, 7, 4b, 3, 5. Sequences 1 and 7 partially overlap and are presented from different points of view, as do sequences 2 and 6. According to Philip Parker, the structural form is \"an episodic narrative with circular events adding a beginning and end and allowing references to elements of each separate episode to be made throughout the narrative\".<ref>Parker (2002), p. 23.</ref> Other analysts describe the structure as a \"circular narrative\".<ref>See, e.g., Dancyger (2002), p. 235; {{cite web |last=Villella |first=Fiona A. |title=Circular Narratives: Highlights of Popular Cinema in the '90s |url=http://archive.sensesofcinema.com/contents/00/3/circular.html#b2 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061231115331/http://www.sensesofcinema.com/contents/00/3/circular.html#b2 |archivedate=2006-12-31 |work=Senses of Cinema |date=January 2000 |access-date=2006-12-31}}</ref>\n\n=== Summary ===\n<!-- Plot length should be 400-700 words. See WP:FILMPLOT. -->\nHitmen Jules Winnfield and Vincent Vega arrive at an apartment to retrieve a briefcase for their boss, gangster Marsellus Wallace, from a business partner, Brett. After Vincent checks the contents of the briefcase, Jules shoots one of Brett's associates, then declaims a passage from the Bible before he and Vincent kill Brett for trying to double-cross Marsellus. They take the briefcase to Marsellus, but have to wait while he bribes champion boxer Butch Coolidge to [[Match fixing|take a dive]] in his upcoming match.\n\nThe next day, Vincent purchases [[heroin]] from his drug dealer, Lance. He shoots up, then drives to meet Marsellus's wife Mia, whom he had agreed to escort while Marsellus was out of town. They eat at a 1950s-themed restaurant and participate in a [[Twist (dance)|twist]] contest, then return home with the trophy. While Vincent is in the bathroom, Mia finds his heroin, mistakes it for [[cocaine]], snorts it, and overdoses. Vincent rushes her to Lance's house, where they revive her with an adrenalin shot to her heart.\n\nButch betrays Marsellus and wins the bout, accidentally killing his opponent. At the motel where he and his girlfriend Fabienne are lying low and preparing to flee, Butch discovers she has forgotten to pack his father's gold watch, a beloved heirloom, and flies into a rage. Returning to his apartment to retrieve the watch, he notices a suppressed [[MAC-10]] on the kitchen counter and hears the toilet flush. Vincent exits the bathroom and Butch shoots him dead, leaving the gun inside.\n\nAs Butch waits at a traffic light in his car, Marsellus spots him by chance crossing the road and chases him into a pawnshop. The owner, Maynard, captures them at gunpoint and ties them up in the basement. Maynard is joined by Zed, a security guard; they take Marsellus to another room to rape him, leaving \"the gimp\", a silent figure in a [[bondage suit]], to watch Butch. Butch breaks loose and knocks out the gimp. He is about to flee but decides to save Marsellus, returning with a [[katana]] from the pawnshop. He kills Maynard; Marsellus retrieves Maynard's shotgun and shoots Zed. Marsellus informs Butch that they are even, as long as he tells no-one about the rape and departs Los Angeles forever. Butch picks up Fabienne on Zed's [[Chopper (motorcycle)|chopper]] and they drive away.\n\nEarlier, after Vincent and Jules have executed Brett in his apartment, another man bursts out of the bathroom and shoots at them wildly, missing every time; Jules and Vincent kill him. Jules professes their survival was a miracle, which Vincent disputes. As Jules drives, Vincent accidentally shoots Brett's associate Marvin in the head. They hide the car at the home of Jules' friend Jimmie, who demands they deal with the problem before his wife comes home. Marsellus sends his [[Cleaner (crime)|cleaner]], Winston Wolfe, who directs Jules and Vincent to clean the car, hide the body in the trunk, dispose of their bloody clothes, and take the car to a junkyard.\n\nAt a diner, Jules tells Vincent that he plans to retire from his life of crime, convinced that their \"miraculous\" survival at the apartment was a sign of [[miracle|divine intervention]]. While Vincent is in the bathroom, a couple dubbed \"Pumpkin\" and \"Honey Bunny\" hold up the restaurant. Jules overpowers Pumpkin and holds him at gunpoint; Honey Bunny becomes hysterical and trains her gun on him. Vincent returns with his gun aimed at her. Jules recites the biblical passage, expresses ambivalence about his life of crime, and allows the robbers to take his cash and leave.

In 1995, in a special edition of ''[[At the Movies (1986 TV program)|Siskel & Ebert]]'' devoted to Tarantino, [[Gene Siskel]] argued that the work posed a major challenge to the \"ossification of American movies with their brutal formulas\". In Siskel's view,\n\n<blockquote>\nthe violent intensity of ''Pulp Fiction'' calls to mind other violent watershed films that were considered classics in their time and still are. [[Alfred Hitchcock|Hitchcock]]'s ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' [1960], [[Arthur Penn]]'s ''[[Bonnie and Clyde (film)|Bonnie and Clyde]]'' [1967], and [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s ''[[A Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange]]'' [1971]. Each film shook up a tired, bloated movie industry and used a world of lively lowlifes to reflect how dull other movies had become. And that, I predict, will be the ultimate honor for ''Pulp Fiction''. Like all great films, it criticizes other movies.<ref name=\"SE\">\"Pulp Faction: The Tarantino Generation\", ''Siskel & Ebert'', ''Pulp Fiction'' DVD (Buena Vista Home Entertainment).</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nKen Dancyger writes that its \"imitative and innovative style\"&nbsp;\u2013 like that of its predecessor, ''[[Reservoir Dogs]]''&nbsp;\u2013 represents\n\n<blockquote>\na new phenomenon, the movie whose style is created from the context of movie life rather than real life. The consequence is twofold&nbsp;\u2013 the presumption of deep knowledge on the part of the audience of those forms such as the [[gangster film]]s or Westerns, horror films or adventure films. And that the parody or alteration of that film creates a new form, a different experience for the audience.<ref>Dancyger (2002), p. 228.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n[[File:Quentin Tarantino Uma Thurman John Travolta Cannes 2014.jpg|thumb|[[John Travolta]], [[Uma Thurman]] and [[Quentin Tarantino]] at the [[2014 Cannes Film Festival]], for the film's 20th anniversary tribute.]]\nIn a widely covered speech on May 31, 1995, Republican presidential candidate [[Bob Dole]] attacked the American entertainment industry for peddling \"nightmares of depravity\".

Not because all audiences got all or any of its references to Scorsese and Kubrick, but because the narrative and spatial structure of the film never threatened to go beyond themselves into signification. The film's cycle of racist and homophobic jokes might threaten to break out into a quite nasty view of the world, but this nastiness keeps being laughed off&nbsp;\u2014 by the mock intensity of the action, the prowling, confronting, perverse, confined, and airless nastiness of the world Tarantino creates.<ref name=\"K250\">Kolker (2000), p. 250.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n[[Henry Giroux|Henry A. Giroux]] argues that Tarantino \"empties violence of any critical social consequences, offering viewers only the immediacy of shock, humor, and irony-without-insight as elements of mediation. None of these elements gets beyond the seduction of voyeuristic gazing&nbsp;... [t]he facile consumption of shocking images and hallucinatory delight.\"<ref>Giroux (1996), p. 77.</ref>\n\nRegarding the violence and nihilism in the film, Pamela Demory has suggested that ''Pulp Fiction'' should be seen in light of the short stories of [[Flannery O'Connor]],<ref>[Pamela H. Demory, \"Violence and Transcendence in ''Pulp Fiction'' and Flannery O'Connor\" in ''The Image of Violence in Literature, the Media, and Society: Selected Papers [from the] 1995 Conference [of the] Society for the Interdisciplinary Study of Social Imagery'', ed. and intro., Will Wright and Steven Kaplan (Pueblo, Co.: Society for the Interdisciplinary Study of Social Imagery, 1995): 187-194.]</ref> which likewise feature \"religious elements, banality, and violence with grotesque humor.\" Discussing \"the connection between violence and redemption,\" Demory concludes that while O'Connor's purpose is to convince readers \"of the powerful force of evil in the world and of our need for grace,\" Tarantino \"seeks to demonstrate that in spite of everything we have seen in the film&nbsp;\u2014 all the violence, degradation, death, crime, amoral behavior&nbsp;\u2014 grace is still possible; there might be still be a God who doesn't judge us on merits.\"<ref>[Quoted in ''Flannery O'Connor: An Annotated Reference Guide to Criticism'', ed. R. Neil Scott (Milledgeville, Georgia: Timberlane Books, 2002), p. 185]</ref>\n\n=== Homage as essence ===\n==== Cinema ====\n''Pulp Fiction'' is full of [[Homage (arts)|homages]] to other movies. \"Tarantino's characters\", writes [[Gary Groth]], \"inhabit a world where the entire landscape is composed of Hollywood product. Tarantino is a cinematic kleptomaniac&nbsp;\u2013 he literally can't help himself.\"<ref>Groth (1997), p. 189.</ref> Two scenes in particular have prompted discussion of the film's highly [[Intertextuality|intertextual]] style. Many have assumed that the dance sequence at Jack Rabbit Slim's was intended as a reference to Travolta's star-making performance as Tony Manero in the epochal ''[[Saturday Night Fever]]'' (1977); Tarantino, however, credits a scene in the [[Jean-Luc Godard]] film ''[[Bande \u00e0 part (film)|Bande \u00e0 part]]'' (1964) with the inspiration. According to the filmmaker;\n\n<blockquote>\nEverybody thinks that I wrote this scene just to have John Travolta dancing. But the scene existed before John Travolta was cast. But once he was cast, it was like, \"Great. We get to see John dance. All the better.\"...&nbsp;My favorite musical sequences have always been in Godard, because they just come out of nowhere. It's so infectious, so friendly.

We keep waiting for him to shed his paunch, put on a white polyester suit, and enter the 2001 Odyssey club in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, where he will dance for us and never, never stop. Daniel Day-Lewis couldn't have woken such a powerful longing in us. He isn't part of America's own mad cosmology&nbsp;... Tony Manero [is] an angel sitting on Vince's shoulder&nbsp;...

For Tarantino's admiration of Siegel, see Dawson (1995), p. 142.</ref>\n\nDavid Bell argues that far from going against the \"current of class stereotype\", this scene, like ''Deliverance'', \"mobilize[s] a certain construction of poor white country folk&nbsp;\u2014 and particularly their sexualization&nbsp;... 'rustic sexual expression often takes the form of homosexual rape' in American movies.\"<ref>Bell (2000), p. 87.</ref> Stephen Paul Miller believes the ''Pulp Fiction'' scene goes down much easier than the one it echoes: \"The buggery perpetrated is not at all as shocking as it was in ''Deliverance''&nbsp;... The nineties film reduces seventies competition, horror, and taboo into an entertainingly subtle adrenaline play&nbsp;\u2014 a fiction, a pulp fiction.\"<ref>Miller (1999), p. 76.</ref> Giroux reads the rape scene homage similarly: \"in the end Tarantino's use of parody is about repetition, transgression, and softening the face of violence by reducing it to the property of film history.\"<ref>Giroux (1996), p. 78.</ref> In Groth's view, the crucial difference is that \"in ''Deliverance'' the rape created the film's central moral dilemma whereas in ''Pulp Fiction'' it was merely 'the single weirdest day of [Butch's] life.'\"<ref>Groth (1997), p. 188.</ref> (\"''[[American Me]]'' did it too,\" Tarantino observed. \"There's like ''three'' butt-fucking scenes in ''American Me''. That's definitely the one to beat in that particular category!\"<ref>[[Rolling Stone]], November 3, 1994, p110</ref>)\n\nNeil Fulwood focuses on Butch's weapon selection, writing, \"Here, Tarantino's love of movies is at its most open and nonjudgemental, tipping a nod to the noble and the notorious, as well as sending up his own reputation as an [[enfant terrible]] of movie violence. Moreover, the scene makes a sly comment about the readiness of cinema to seize upon whatever is to hand for its moments of mayhem and murder.\"<ref name=\"F\" /> White asserts that \"the katana he finally, and significantly, selects identifies him with&nbsp;... [[honour]]able heroes.\"<ref name=\"W\" /> Conard argues that the first three items symbolize a nihilism that Butch is rejecting. The traditional Japanese sword, in contrasts, represents a culture with a well-defined [[Morality|moral code]] and thus connects Butch with a more meaningful approach to life.<ref>Conard (2006), pp. 125, 133.</ref>\n\n==== Television ====\nRobert Miklitsch argues that \"Tarantino's telephilia\" may be more central to the guiding sensibility of ''Pulp Fiction'' than the filmmaker's love for rock 'n' roll and even cinema:\n\n<blockquote>\nTalking about his generation, one that came of age in the '70s, Tarantino has commented that the \"number one thing we all shared wasn't music, that was a Sixties thing. Our culture was television.\" A random list of the TV programs referenced in ''Pulp Fiction'' confirms his observation: ''[[Speed Racer]], [[Clutch Cargo]], [[The Brady Bunch]], [[The Partridge Family]], [[The Avengers (TV series)|The Avengers]], [[The Three Stooges]], [[The Flintstones]], [[I Spy (1965 TV series)|I Spy]], [[Green Acres]], [[Kung Fu (TV series)|Kung Fu]], [[Happy Days]]'', and last but not least, Mia's fictional pilot, ''Fox Force Five''.<ref>Miklitsch, pp. 15, 16. Note that while the Three Stooges did have an original TV series that ran briefly in the mid-1960s, they were most familiar from their cinematic [[Short film|shorts]] that were [[Broadcast syndication|syndicated]] to television.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n\"The above list, with the possible exception of ''The Avengers'',\" writes Miklitsch, \"suggests that ''Pulp Fiction'' has less of an elective affinity with the cinematic avant-gardism of Godard than with mainstream network programming.\"<ref name=\"M16\">Miklitsch, p. 16.</ref> Jonathan Rosenbaum had brought TV into his analysis of the Tarantino/Godard comparison, acknowledging that the directors were similar in wanting to cram everything they like onscreen: \"But the differences between what Godard likes and what Tarantino likes and why are astronomical; it's like comparing a combined museum, library, film archive, record shop, and department store with a jukebox, a video-rental outlet, and an issue of ''[[TV Guide]]''.\"<ref name=\"JR\" />\n\nSharon Willis focuses on the way a television show (''[[Clutch Cargo]]'') marks the beginning of, and plays on through, the scene between young Butch and his father's comrade-in-arms. The Vietnam War veteran is played by Christopher Walken, whose presence in the role evokes his performance as a traumatized G.I. in the Vietnam War movie ''[[The Deer Hunter]]'' (1978). Willis writes that \"when Captain Koons enters the living room, we see Walken in his function as an image retrieved from a repertoire of 1970s television and movie versions of ruined [[masculinity]] in search of rehabilitation&nbsp;... [T]he gray light of the television presiding over the scene seems to inscribe the ghostly paternal gaze.\"<ref name=\"Willis\">Willis (1997), p. 195.</ref> Miklitsch asserts that, for some critics, the film is a \"prime example of the pernicious ooze-like influence of mass culture exemplified by their b\u00eate noire: TV.\"<ref name=\"M16\" /> Kolker might not disagree, arguing that \"''Pulp Fiction'' is a simulacrum of our daily exposure to television; its homophobes, thugs and perverts, sentimental boxers and pimp promoters move through a series of long-take tableaux: we watch, laugh, and remain with nothing to comprehend.\"<ref name=\"K250\" />\n\n=== Notable motifs ===\n\n==== The mysterious 666 briefcase ====\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction = vertical\n| width     = 200\n| image1    = PulpFictionCase.jpg\n| caption1  =Vincent \"stares&nbsp;... transfixed\" into the glowing case, as specified in Tarantino's screenplay.<ref>Tarantino (1994), p. 28.</ref>\n\n| image2    = KissMeDeadlyPandora.jpg\n| caption2  = Vincent's demeanor reinforces the allusion to the scene in ''[[Kiss Me Deadly]]'' (1955) in which Lily Carver, a.k.a.

Tarantino has said there is no explanation for its contents&nbsp;\u2013 it is simply a [[MacGuffin]], a pure [[plot device]]. Originally, the case was to contain diamonds, but this was seen as too mundane. For filming purposes, it contained a hidden orange light bulb that produced an otherworldly glow when the case was opened.<ref>{{cite web|title=What's In the Briefcase?|url=http://www.snopes.com/movies/films/pulp.htm|website=Snopes.com|date=2007-08-17|access-date=2007-09-13}}</ref> In a 2007 video interview with fellow director and friend [[Robert Rodriguez]], Tarantino purportedly \"reveals\" the secret contents of the briefcase, but the film cuts out and skips the scene in the style employed in Tarantino and Rodriguez's ''[[Grindhouse (film)|Grindhouse]]'' (2007), with an intertitle that reads \"Missing Reel\".

Analyzing the notion, [[Roger Ebert]] dismissed it as \"nothing more than a widely distributed urban legend given false credibility by the mystique of the Net\".<ref>Ebert 1997, p. 188.</ref>\n\n==== Jules' Bible passage ====\nJules ritually recites what he describes as a biblical passage, [[Book of Ezekiel|Ezekiel]] 25:17, before he executes someone. The passage is heard three times&nbsp;\u2013 in the introductory sequence in which Jules and Vincent reclaim Marsellus' briefcase from the doomed Brett; that same recitation a second time, at the beginning of \"The Bonnie Situation\", which overlaps the end of the earlier sequence; and in the epilogue at the diner. The first version of the passage is as follows:\n\n<blockquote>The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the iniquities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he who in the name of charity and goodwill shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy My brothers. And you will know My name is the Lord when I lay My vengeance upon thee.</blockquote>\n\nThe second version, from the diner scene, is identical except for the final line: \"And you will know I am the Lord when I lay my vengeance upon you.\"\n\n{{listen|filename=End of Ezekiel.ogg|title=\"And I will strike down&nbsp;...\"| description= Conclusion of the \"Ezekiel 25:17\" monologue and Brett's murder}}\n\nWhile the final two sentences of Jules' speech are similar to the actual cited passage, the first two are fabricated from various biblical phrases.<ref>Reinhartz (2003), p. 108.</ref> The text of Ezekiel 25 preceding verse 17 indicates that God's wrath is retribution for the hostility of the [[Philistines]]. In the [[King James Version]] from which Jules' speech is adapted, Ezekiel 25:17 reads in its entirety:\n\n<blockquote>And I will execute great vengeance upon them with furious rebukes; and they shall know that I ''am'' the LORD, when I shall lay My vengeance upon them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/108/26/25.html|title=The Book of the Prophet Ezekiel, 25|work=The Holy Bible: King James Version|access-date=2007-09-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100131052531/http://www.bartleby.com/108/26/25.html|archive-date=January 31, 2010|url-status=live}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nTarantino's primary inspiration for the speech was the work of Japanese [[martial arts film|martial arts]] star [[Sonny Chiba]]. Its text and its identification as Ezekiel 25:17 derive from an almost identical creed that appears at the beginning of the Chiba movie ''[[Karate Kiba]]'' (''The Bodyguard''; 1976), where it is both shown as a scrolling text and read by an offscreen narrator.<ref>Thomas (2003) notes that instead of \"the Lord\", this version reads \"...&nbsp;and they shall know that I am Chiba the Bodyguard&nbsp;...\" (pp. 61\u201362). Conard (2006) claims that the text originates from the film ''Bodigaado Kiba'' (''Bodyguard Kiba'' or ''The Bodyguard''; 1973) and that the end phrase there is \"And you will know my name is Chiba the Bodyguard&nbsp;...\" (p. 135, n. 4).</ref>\n\nThe version seen at the beginning of ''The Bodyguard (1976)'' is as follows:\n\n<blockquote>The path of the righteous man and defender is beset on all sides by the iniquity of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he, who in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper, and the father of lost children. And I will execute great vengeance upon them with furious anger, who poison and destroy my brothers; and they shall know that I am Chiba the Bodyguard when I shall lay my vengeance upon them!</blockquote>\n\nIn the 1980s television series ''Kage no Gundan'' (''[[Shadow Warriors (TV series)|Shadow Warriors]]''), Chiba's character would lecture the villain-of-the-week about how the world must be rid of evil before killing him.<ref>Enhanced Trivia Track, ch. 4, ''Pulp Fiction'' DVD (Buena Vista Home Entertainment).</ref> A killer delivers a similar biblical rant in ''[[Modesty Blaise (novel)|Modesty Blaise]]'', the hardback but pulp-style novel Vincent is shown with in two scenes.<ref name=\"T25\">Enhanced Trivia Track, ch. 25, ''Pulp Fiction'' DVD (Buena Vista Home Entertainment).</ref>\n\nTwo critics who have analyzed the role of the speech find different ties between Jules' transformation and the issue of [[postmodernity]]. Gormley argues that unlike the film's other major characters&nbsp;\u2013 Marsellus aside&nbsp;\u2013 Jules is:\n\n<blockquote>\nlinked to a \"thing\" beyond postmodern simulation&nbsp;... [T]his is perhaps most marked when he moves on from being a simulation of a Baptist preacher, spouting Ezekiel because it was \"just a cool thing to say&nbsp;...\" In his conversion, Jules is shown to be cognizant of a place beyond this simulation, which, in this case, the film constructs as God.<ref>Gormley (2005), p. 167.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n[[Adele Reinhartz]] writes that the \"depth of Jules's transformation\" is indicated by the difference in his two deliveries of the passage: \"In the first, he is a majestic and awe-inspiring figure, proclaiming the prophecy with fury and self-righteousness&nbsp;... In the second&nbsp;... he appears to be a different sort of man altogether&nbsp;... [I]n true postmodern fashion, [he] reflects on the meaning of his speech and provides several different ways that it might pertain to his current situation.\"<ref>Reinhartz (2003), pp. 106, 107.</ref> Similar to Gormley, Conard argues that as Jules reflects on the passage, it dawns on him \"that it refers to an objective framework of value and meaning that is absent from his life\"; to Conard, this contrasts with the film's prevalent representation of a nihilistic culture.<ref>Conard (2006), p. 130.</ref> Rosenbaum finds much less in Jules's revelation: \"[T]he [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|spiritual awakening]] at the end of ''Pulp Fiction'', which Jackson performs beautifully, is a piece of jive avowedly inspired by kung-fu movies. It may make you feel good, but it certainly doesn't leave you any wiser.\"<ref>Rosenbaum, Jonathan. \"Allusion Profusion (''Ed Wood, Pulp Fiction'')\", ''Chicago Reader'', October 21, 1994. Note that the avowed inspiration is actually a TV show, ''Kung Fu''.</ref>\n\n==== The bathroom ====\nMuch of ''Pulp Fiction''{{'}}s action revolves around characters who are either in the bathroom or need to use the toilet. To a lesser extent, Tarantino's other films also feature this narrative element.<ref>{{cite web |author1=White, Mike |author2=Mike Thompson |lastauthoramp=yes |work=Cashiers du Cinemart |title=Tarantino in a Can? |url=http://www.impossiblefunky.com/archives/issue_2/2_toilet.asp?IshNum=2&Headline=Tarantino%20In%20The%20Can |date=Spring 1995 |access-date=2006-12-31 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120211214336/http://www.impossiblefunky.com/archives/issue_2/2_toilet.asp?IshNum=2&Headline=Tarantino%20In%20The%20Can |archivedate=2012-02-11}}</ref> At Jack Rabbit Slim's, Mia goes to \"powder her nose\"&nbsp;\u2013 literally; she [[Cocaine#Insufflation|snorts coke]] in the restroom, surrounded by a bevy of women vainly primping. Butch and Fabienne play an extended scene in their motel bathroom, he in the shower, she brushing her teeth; the next morning, but just a few seconds later in screen time, she is again brushing her teeth. As Jules and Vincent confront Brett and two of his pals, a fourth man is hiding in the bathroom&nbsp;\u2013 his actions will lead to Jules' transformative \"moment of clarity\". After Marvin's absurd death, Vincent and Jules wash up in Jimmie's bathroom, where they get into a contretemps over a bloody hand towel.<ref name=\"Den\" /> When the diner hold-up turns into a [[Mexican standoff]], \"Honey Bunny\" whines, \"I gotta go pee!\"<ref name=\"F15\">Fraiman (2003), p. 15.</ref>\n\nAs described by Peter and Will Brooker, \"In three significant moments Vincent retires to the bathroom [and] returns to an utterly changed world where death is threatened.\"<ref name=\"B&B\">Brooker and Brooker (1996), p. 239.</ref> The threat increases in magnitude as the narrative progresses chronologically, and is realized in the third instance:\n\n# Vincent and Jules' diner breakfast and philosophical conversation is aborted by Vincent's bathroom break; an armed robbery ensues while Vincent is reading on the toilet.\n# While Vincent is in the bathroom worrying about the possibility of going too far with Marsellus' wife, Mia mistakes his heroin for cocaine, snorts it, and overdoses.\n# During a stakeout at Butch's apartment, Vincent emerges from the toilet with his book and is killed by Butch.\n\nIn the Brookers' analysis, \"Through Vince&nbsp;... we see the contemporary world as utterly contingent, transformed, disastrously, in the instant you are not looking.\"<ref name=\"B&B\" /> Fraiman finds it particularly significant that Vincent is reading ''Modesty Blaise'' in two of these instances. She links this fact with the traditional derisive view of women as \"the archetypal consumers of pulp\":\n\n<blockquote>\nLocating popular fiction in the bathroom, Tarantino reinforces its association with shit, already suggested by the dictionary meanings of \"pulp\" that preface the movie: moist, shapeless matter; also, lurid stories on cheap paper. What we have then is a series of damaging associations&nbsp;\u2013 pulp, women, shit&nbsp;\u2013 that taint not only male producers of mass-market fiction but also male consumers. Perched on the toilet with his book, Vincent is feminized by sitting instead of standing as well as by his trashy tastes; preoccupied by the anal, he is implicitly infantilized and homosexualized; and the seemingly inevitable result is being pulverized by Butch with a Czech M61 submachine gun. That this fate has to do with Vincent's reading habits is strongly suggested by a slow tilt from the book on the floor directly up to the corpse spilled into the tub.<ref>Fraiman (2003), p. 14. Fraiman's identification of the submachine gun as a [[\u0160korpion|Czech M61]] matches the description in the screenplay: Tarantino (1994), p. 96. Visual evidence suggests that a different gun was actually used in the film, possibly a [[MAC-10]] or similar model.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nWillis reads ''Pulp Fiction'' in almost precisely the opposite direction, finding \"its overarching project as a drive to turn shit into gold. This is one way of describing the project of redeeming and recycling popular culture, especially the popular culture of one's childhood, as is Tarantino's wont as well as his stated aim.\"<ref name=\"Willis\" /> Despite that, argues Fraiman, \"''Pulp Fiction'' demonstrates&nbsp;... that even an open pulpophile like Tarantino may continue to feel anxious and emasculated by his preferences.\"<ref name=\"F15\" />\n\n== Accolades ==\n{{Main|List of accolades received by Pulp Fiction}}\n''Pulp Fiction'' won eight major awards from a total of twenty-six nominations, including a [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]] win at the [[67th Academy Awards]].<ref name=\"PdO\" /><ref name=\"Awards\" /><ref name=\"BAFTA\" /><ref name=\"GGA\">{{cite web|url= http://www.hfpa.org/browse/film/24792|title= Awards Search/''Pulp Fiction''|publisher= Hollywood Foreign Press Association|access-date= 2007-09-12|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070807063318/http://www1.hfpa.org/browse/film/24792|archive-date= August 7, 2007|url-status= live}}</ref><ref name=\"NSFC\">{{cite news|last=Maslin|first=Janet|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/04/movies/pulp-fiction-gets-top-prize-from-national-film-critics.html|title=\"Pulp Fiction\" Gets Top Prize From National Film Critics|work=The New York Times|date=1995-01-04|access-date=2007-09-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170709114845/http://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/04/movies/pulp-fiction-gets-top-prize-from-national-film-critics.html|archive-date=July 9, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> Also, in the balloting by the [[National Society of Film Critics]], [[Samuel L.

He was married to Frances (n\u00e9e Taylor) from 1944 until her death on September 30, 2012. They have two daughters Susan (1946) and Lee (1950). Walker was assigned in 1946 as a medical officer to the Army of Occupation of Japan ({{army|USA}} [[11th Airborne Division (United States)|11th Airborne Division]] ([[Paratroops]])). After reassignment from the army, he started a pediatric practice in Annapolis in 1953. Stuart became a full-time Professor of Pediatrics at the [[University of Maryland]] School of Medicine in 1961 and was Chief of Pediatrics at [[Mercy Medical Center (Baltimore, Maryland)|Mercy Hospital]] in Baltimore until his retirement in 1984. After Frances' death, Stuart married Patricia (n\u00e9e Empey) in 2013.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}} \n\nSailing in the [[International 14]] class, Walker was a member of every American team in international matches between 1961 and 1971 and was, in 1963, the first American to win Bermuda's Princess Elizabeth Trophy and, in 1964, England's Prince of Wales Cup.

{"title_page": "Level sensor", "text_new": "{{Distinguish|Tilt sensor|Dumpy level|Level of measurement}}\n\n'''Level [[sensors]]''' detect the [[liquid level|level of liquids]] and other [[fluids]] and fluidized solids, including [[slurry|slurries]], [[granular]] materials, and [[wikt:powders|powders]] that exhibit an upper [[free surface]]. Substances that flow become essentially [[horizontal plane|horizontal]] in their containers (or other physical boundaries) because of [[gravity]] whereas most bulk solids pile at an angle of repose to a peak. The substance to be measured can be inside a container or can be in its natural form (e.g., a river or a lake). The level measurement can be either continuous or point values. Continuous level sensors measure level within a specified range and determine the exact amount of substance in a certain place, while point-level sensors only indicate whether the substance is above or below the sensing point. Generally the latter detect levels that are excessively high or low.\n\nThere are many physical and application variables that affect the selection of the optimal level monitoring method for industrial and commercial processes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.engineersgarage.com/articles/what-is-level-sensor|title=Level Sensors|last=EngineersGarage|date=18 September 2012|website=www.engineersgarage.com|language=en|access-date=2018-09-16}}</ref> The selection criteria include the physical: [[phase (matter)|phase]] (liquid, solid or slurry), [[temperature]], [[pressure]] or [[vacuum]], [[chemistry]], [[dielectric constant]] of [[Transmission medium|medium]], [[density]] (specific gravity) of medium, [[agitation (action)]], acoustical or electrical [[noise]], [[vibration]], [[Shock (mechanics)|mechanical shock]], tank or bin size and shape. Also important are the application constraints: price, accuracy, appearance, response rate, ease of [[calibration]] or [[Mathematical programming|programming]], physical size and mounting of the instrument, monitoring or control of continuous or discrete (point) levels.\nIn short, level sensors are one of the very important sensors and play very important role in a variety of consumer/ industrial applications. As with other types of sensors, level sensors are available or can be designed using a variety of sensing principles. Selection of an appropriate type of sensor suiting to the application requirement is very important.\n\n==Point and continuous level detection for solids==\nA variety of sensors are available for point level detection of solids. These include vibrating, rotating paddle, mechanical ([[Diaphragm (mechanical device)|diaphragm]]), [[microwave]] ([[radar]]), capacitance, optical, pulsed-ultrasonic and [[ultrasonic sensor|ultrasonic]] level sensors.\n\n===Vibrating point  ===\n[[File:Sensor prinzip.svg|thumb|Principle of vibration point probe]]\n\nThese detect levels of very fine powders (bulk density: 0.02&nbsp;g/cm<sup>3</sup> \u2013 0.2&nbsp;g/cm<sup>3</sup>), fine powders (bulk density: 0.2&nbsp;g/cm<sup>3</sup> \u2013 0.5&nbsp;g/cm<sup>3</sup>), and granular solids (bulk density: 0.5&nbsp;g/cm<sup>3</sup> or greater). With proper selection of vibration frequency and suitable sensitivity adjustments, they can also sense the level of highly fluidized powders and electrostatic materials.\n\nSingle-probe vibrating level sensors are ideal for bulk powder level. Since only one sensing element contacts the powder, bridging between two probe elements is eliminated and media build-up is minimized. The vibration of the probe tends to eliminate build-up of material on the probe element. Vibrating level sensors are not affected by dust, static charge build-up from dielectric powders, or changes in conductivity, temperature, pressure, humidity or moisture content. Tuning-fork style vibration sensors are another alternative. They tend to be less costly, but are prone to material buildup between the tines,\n\n===Rotating paddle ===\nThe first rotating paddle level sensor was invented by Emma Purcell in 2003. Rotating paddle level sensors are a very old and established technique for bulk solid point level indication. The technique uses a low-speed gear motor that rotates a paddle wheel. When the paddle is stalled by solid materials, the motor is rotated on its shaft by its own torque until a flange mounted on the motor contacts a mechanical switch. The paddle can be constructed from a variety of materials, but tacky material must not be allowed to build up on the paddle. Build-up may occur if the process material becomes tacky because of high moisture levels or high ambient humidity in the hopper. For materials with very low weight per unit volume such as [[Perlite]], [[Bentonite]] or [[fly ash]], special paddle designs and low-torque motors are used. Fine particles or dust must be prevented from penetrating the shaft bearings and motor by proper placement of the paddle in the hopper or bin and using appropriate seals.\n\n===Admittance-type ===\nAn RF admittance level sensor uses a rod probe and RF source to measure the change in [[admittance]]. The probe is driven through a shielded coaxial cable to eliminate the effects of changing cable capacitance to ground. When the level changes around the probe, a corresponding change in the dielectric is observed. This changes the admittance of this imperfect capacitor and this change is measured to detect change of level.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.sapconinstruments.com/fly-ash-level-detection/ | title = Fly Ash Level Detection | author = Sapcon Instruments | accessdate = 2016-09-22}}</ref>\n\n==Point level detection of liquids ==\nTypical systems for point level detection in liquids include magnetic and mechanical floats, pressure sensors, electroconductive sensing or electrostatic (capacitance or inductance) detectors -- and by measurement of a signal's time-of-flight to the fluid surface, through electromagnetic (such as magnetostrictive), ultrasonic, radar or optical sensors.<ref name=\"esi_tank_sensors\">[http://www.leveldevilsensors.com/main/electronic-sensors-inc-esi-level-devil-american-made-tank-monitors-and-tank-monitoring-systems/tabk-sensor/ Tank Sensors & Probes], Electronic Sensors, Inc., retrieved August 8, 2018</ref><ref name=\"dozen_ways_2004_dec_1_sensormag_com\">Henry Hopper, [https://www.sensorsmag.com/components/a-dozen-ways-to-measure-fluid-level-and-how-they-work \"A Dozen Ways to Measure Fluid Level and How They Work,\"] December 1, 2018, ''Sensors Magazine,'' retrieved August 29 2018</ref>\n\n===Magnetic and mechanical float ===\n{{see also|Float (liquid level)|Float switch|Magnetic level gauge}}\n\nThe principle behind magnetic, mechanical, cable, and other float level sensors often involves the opening or closing of a mechanical switch, either through direct contact with the switch, or magnetic operation of a reed. In other instances, such as magnetostrictive sensors, continuous monitoring is possible using a float principle.\n\nWith magnetically actuated float sensors, switching occurs when a permanent magnet sealed inside a float rises or falls to the actuation level. With a mechanically actuated float, switching occurs as a result of the movement of a float against a miniature (micro) switch. For both magnetic and mechanical float level sensors, chemical compatibility, temperature, specific gravity (density), buoyancy, and viscosity affect the selection of the stem and the float. For example, larger floats may be used with liquids with specific gravities as low as 0.5 while still maintaining buoyancy. The choice of float material is also influenced by temperature-induced changes in specific gravity and viscosity \u2013 changes that directly affect buoyancy.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.deeterelectronicsinc.com/ | title = Float Level Sensors | author = Deeter | accessdate = 2009-05-05}}</ref>\n\nFloat-type sensors can be designed so that a shield protects the float itself from turbulence and wave motion. Float sensors operate well in a wide variety of liquids, including corrosives. When used for organic solvents, however, one will need to verify that these liquids are chemically compatible with the materials used to construct the sensor. Float-style sensors should not be used with high viscosity (thick) liquids, sludge or liquids that adhere to the stem or floats, or materials that contain contaminants such as metal chips; other sensing technologies are better suited for these applications.\n\nA special application of float-type sensors is the determination of interface level in oil-water separation systems. Two floats can be used with each float sized to match the specific gravity of the oil on one hand, and the water on the other. Another special application of a stem type float switch is the installation of temperature or pressure sensors to create a multi-parameter sensor. Magnetic float switches are popular for simplicity, dependability and low cost.\n\nA variation of magnetic sensing is the \"[[Hall effect]]\" sensor which utilizes the magnetic sensing of a mechanical gauge's indications.  In a typical application, a magnetism-sensitive \"Hall effect sensor\" is affixed to a mechanical tank gauge that has a magnetized indicator needle, so as to detect the indicating position of the gauge's needle. The magnetic sensor translates the indicator needle position into an electrical signal, allowing other (usually remote) indication or signalling.<ref name=\"esi_tank_sensors\" />\n\n===Pneumatic ===\nPneumatic level sensors are used where hazardous conditions exist, where there is no electric power or its use is restricted, or in applications involving heavy sludge or slurry. As the compression of a column of air against a diaphragm is used to actuate a switch, no process liquid contacts the sensor's [[moving parts]]. These sensors are suitable for use with highly viscous liquids such as grease, as well as water-based and corrosive liquids. This has the additional benefit of being a relatively low cost technique for point level monitoring. A variation of this technique is the \"bubbler\", which compresses air into a tube to the bottom of the tank, until the pressure increase halts as the air pressure gets high enough to expel air bubbles from the bottom of the tube, overcoming the pressure there.  The measurement of the stabilized air pressure indicates the pressure at the bottom of the tank, and, hence, the mass of fluid above.<ref name=\"Roy2013\">{{cite book|author=G. J.

For those conductive liquids that are corrosive, the sensor\u2019s electrodes need to be constructed from titanium, Hastelloy B or C, or 316 stainless steel and insulated with spacers, separators or holders of ceramic, polyethylene and Teflon-based materials. Depending on their design, multiple electrodes of differing lengths can be used with one holder. Since corrosive liquids become more aggressive as temperature and pressure increase, these extreme conditions need to be considered when specifying these sensors.\n    \nConductive level sensors use a low-voltage, current-limited power source applied across separate electrodes. The power supply is matched to the conductivity of the liquid, with higher voltage versions designed to operate in less conductive (higher resistance) mediums. The power source frequently incorporates some aspect of control, such as high-low or alternating pump control. A conductive liquid contacting both the longest probe (common) and a shorter probe (return) completes a conductive circuit. Conductive sensors are extremely safe because they use low voltages and currents. Since the current and voltage used is inherently small, for personal safety reasons, the technique is also capable of being made \"[[Intrinsic safety|Intrinsically Safe]]\" to meet international standards for [[Electrical equipment in hazardous areas|hazardous locations]]. Conductive probes have the additional benefit of being solid-state devices and are very simple to install and use.  In some liquids and applications, maintenance can be an issue. The probe must continue to be conductive. If buildup insulates the probe from the medium, it will stop working properly. A simple inspection of the probe will require an ohmmeter connected across the suspect probe and the ground reference.\n\nTypically, in most water and wastewater wells, the well itself with its ladders, pumps and other metal installations, provides a ground return. However, in chemical tanks, and other non-grounded wells, the installer must supply a ground return, typically an earth rod.\n\n===State dependent frequency monitor===\nA microprocessor controlled frequency state change detection method uses a low amplitude signal generated on multiple sensor probes of differing lengths.  Each probe has a frequency separate from all other probes in the array and independently changes state when touched by water.  The state change of the frequency on each probe is monitored by a microprocessor which can perform multiple water level control functions. \n \nA strength of state dependent frequency monitoring is long term stability of the sensing probes.  The signal strength is not sufficient to cause fouling, degradation, or deterioration of the sensors due to electrolysis in contaminated water.  Sensor cleaning requirements are minimal or eliminated.  Use of multiple sensing rods of different length allows the user to intuitively set up control switches at various water heights.\n\nThe microprocessor in a state dependent frequency monitor can actuate valves and/or large pumps with very low power consumption.  Multiple switch controls can be built in to small package while providing complex, application specific functionality using the microprocessor.  Low power consumption of the controls is consistent across large and small field applications.  This universal technology is used in applications with wide-ranging liquid quality.\n\n==Sensors for both point level detection or continuous monitoring ==\n\n===Ultrasonic ===\n[[File:Ultrasonic level sensor used in a water treatment plant.jpg|thumb|Ultrasonic level sensor used in a water treatment plant]]\n[[Ultrasound|Ultrasonic]] level sensors are used for non-contact level sensing of highly viscous liquids, as well as bulk solids. They are also widely used in water treatment applications for pump control and open channel flow measurement. The sensors emit high frequency (20&nbsp;kHz to 200&nbsp;kHz) acoustic waves that are reflected back to and detected by the emitting transducer.<ref name=\"esi_tank_sensors\" />\n\t\nUltrasonic level sensors are also affected by the changing [[speed of sound]] due to moisture, temperature, and pressures. Correction factors can be applied to the level measurement to improve the accuracy of measurement.\n\nTurbulence, foam, steam, chemical mists (vapors), and changes in the concentration of the process material also affect the ultrasonic sensor\u2019s response. Turbulence and foam prevent the sound wave from being properly reflected to the sensor; steam and chemical mists and vapors distort or absorb the sound wave; and variations in concentration cause changes in the amount of energy in the sound wave that is reflected back to the sensor.  Stilling wells and waveguides are used to prevent errors caused by these factors.\n\nProper mounting of the transducer is required to ensure the best response to reflected sound. In addition, the hopper, bin, or tank should be relatively free of obstacles such as weldments, brackets, or ladders to minimise false returns and the resulting erroneous response, although most modern systems have sufficiently \"intelligent\" echo processing to make engineering changes largely unnecessary except where an intrusion blocks the \"line of sight\" of the transducer to the target. Since the ultrasonic transducer is used both for transmitting and receiving the acoustic energy, it is subject to a period of mechanical vibration known as \"ringing\". This vibration must attenuate (stop) before the echoed signal can be processed. The net result is a distance from the face of the transducer that is blind and cannot detect an object. It is known as the \"blanking zone\", typically 150&nbsp;mm to 1&nbsp;m, depending on the range of the transducer.\n\nThe requirement for electronic signal processing circuitry can be used to make the ultrasonic sensor an intelligent device. Ultrasonic sensors can be designed to provide point level control, continuous monitoring or both. Due to the presence of a microprocessor and relatively low power consumption, there is also the capability for serial communication from to other computing devices making this a good technique for adjusting calibration and filtering of the sensor signal, remote wireless monitoring or plant network communications. The ultrasonic sensor enjoys wide popularity due to the powerful mix of low price and high functionality.\n\n===Capacitance ===\n[[Image:Capacitive sensors NOG.jpg|left]]Capacitance level sensors excel in sensing the presence of a wide variety of solids, aqueous and organic liquids, and slurries.<ref>{{cite web|title=Capacitive Level Sensor|url=http://www.levelsensorsolutions.com/capacitive-level-sensor|website=Level Sensor Solutions|publisher=elobau}}</ref>  The technique is frequently referred to as RF for the radio frequency signals applied to the capacitance circuit. The sensors can be designed to sense material with [[dielectric constant]]s as low as 1.1 (coke and fly ash) and as high as 88 (water) or more. Sludges and slurries such as dehydrated cake and sewage slurry (dielectric constant approx. 50) and liquid chemicals such as quicklime (dielectric constant approx. 90) can also be sensed.<ref name=\"esi_tank_sensors\" /> Dual-probe capacitance level sensors can also be used to sense the interface between two immiscible liquids with substantially different dielectric constants, providing a solid state alternative to the aforementioned magnetic float switch for the \"oil-water interface\" application.\n\nSince capacitance level sensors are electronic devices, phase modulation and the use of higher frequencies makes the sensor suitable for applications in which dielectric constants are similar.  The sensor contains no moving parts, is rugged, simple to use, and easy to clean, and can be designed for high temperature and pressure applications. A danger exists from build-up and discharge of a high-voltage static charge that results from the rubbing and movement of low dielectric materials, but this danger can be eliminated with proper design and grounding.\n\nAppropriate choice of probe materials reduces or eliminates problems caused by abrasion and corrosion. Point level sensing of adhesives and high-viscosity materials such as oil and grease can result in the build-up of material on the probe; however, this can be minimized by using a self-tuning sensor. For liquids prone to foaming and applications prone to splashing or turbulence, capacitance level sensors can be designed with splashguards or stilling wells, among other devices.\n\nA significant limitation for capacitance probes is in tall bins used for storing bulk solids. The requirement for a conductive probe that extends to the bottom of the measured range is problematic. Long conductive cable probes (20 to 50 meters long), suspended into the bin or silo, are subject to tremendous mechanical tension due to the weight of the bulk powder in the silo and the friction applied to the cable. Such installations will frequently result in a cable breakage.\n\n===Optical interface ===\nOptical sensors are used for point level sensing of sediments, liquids with suspended solids, and liquid-liquid interfaces. These sensors sense the decrease or change in transmission of infrared light emitted from an infrared diode (LED). With the proper choice of construction materials and mounting location, these sensors can be used with aqueous, organic, and corrosive liquids. \n\t\nA common application of economical infrared-based optical interface point level sensors is detecting the sludge/water interface in settling ponds. By using pulse modulation techniques and a high power infrared diode, one can eliminate interference from ambient light, operate the LED at a higher gain, and lessen the effects of build-up on the probe.\n\nAn alternate approach for continuous optical level sensing involves the use of a laser. Laser light is more concentrated and therefore is more capable of penetrating dusty or steamy environments. Laser light will reflect off most solid, liquid surfaces. The time of flight can be measured with precise timing circuitry, to determine the range or distance of the surface from the sensor. Lasers remain limited in use in industrial applications due to cost, and concern for maintenance. The optics must be frequently cleaned to maintain performance.\n\n===Microwave ===\nMicrowave sensors are ideal for use in moist, vaporous, and dusty environments as well as in applications in which temperatures and pressures vary. Microwaves (also frequently described as RADAR), will penetrate temperature and vapor layers that may cause problems for other techniques, such as ultrasonic.<ref name=\"esi_tank_sensors\" /> Microwaves are electromagnetic energy and therefore do not require air molecules to transmit the energy making them useful in vacuums.   Microwaves, as electromagnetic energy, are reflected by objects with high conductive properties, like metal and conductive water. Alternately, they are absorbed in various degrees by 'low dielectric' or insulating mediums such as plastics, glass, paper, many powders and food stuffs and other solids.\n\nMicrowave sensors are executed in a wide variety of techniques. Two basic signal processing techniques are applied, each offering its own advantages: Pulsed or Time-Domain Reflectometry (TDR) which is a measurement of time of flight divided by the speed of light, similar to ultrasonic level sensors, and Doppler systems employing FMCW techniques. Just as with ultrasonic level sensors, microwave sensors are executed at various frequencies, from 1&nbsp;GHz to 60&nbsp;GHz.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.senz2.com/project/levelradar|title=Wireless Level Radar - SenZ2 B.V.|author=|date=|website=www.senz2.com}}</ref>  Generally, the higher the frequency, the more accurate, and the more costly. Microwave is executed  non-contact technique or guided. The first is done by monitoring a microwave signal that is transmitted through free space (including vacuum) and reflected back, or can be executed as a \"radar on a wire\" technique, generally known as Guided Wave Radar or Guided Microwave Radar. In the latter technique, performance generally improves in powders and low dielectric media that are not good reflectors of electromagnetic energy transmitted through a void (as in non-contact microwave sensors). But with the guided technique the same mechanical constraints exist that cause problems for the capacitance (RF) techniques mentioned previously by having a probe in the vessel.\n\nNon contact microwave-based radar sensors are able to see through low conductivity 'microwave-transparent' (non-conductive) glass/plastic windows or vessel walls through which the microwave beam can be passed and measure a 'microwave reflective' (conductive) liquid inside (in the same way as to use a plastic bowl in a microwave oven). They are also largely unaffected by high temperature, pressure, vacuum or vibration. As these sensors do not require physical contact with the process material, so the transmitter /receiver can be mounted a safe distance above/from the process, even with an antenna extension of several metres to reduce temperature, yet still respond to the changes in level or distance changes e.g. they are ideal for measurement of molten metal products at over 1200&nbsp;\u00b0C. Microwave transmitters also offer the same key advantage of ultrasonics: the presence of a microprocessor to process the signal, provide numerous monitoring, controls, communications, setup and diagnostic capabilities and are independent of changing density, viscosity and electrical properties. Additionally, they solve some of the application limitations of ultrasonics: operation in high pressure and vacuum, high temperatures, dust, temperature and vapor layers. \nGuided Wave Radars can measure in narrow confined spaces very successfully, as the guide element ensures correct transmission to and from the measured liquid. Applications such as inside stilling tubes or external bridles or cages, offer an excellent alternative to float or displacement devices, as they remove any moving parts or linkages and are unaffected by density changes or build up. They are also excellent with very low microwave reflectivity products like liquid gasses (LNG, LPG, Ammonia) which are stored at low temperatures/high pressures, although care needs to be taken on sealing arrangements and hazardous area approvals. On bulk solids and powders, GWR offers a great alternative to radar or ultrasonic sensors, but some care needs to be taken over cable wear and roof loading by the product movement.\n\nOne perceived major disadvantage of microwave or radar techniques for level monitoring is the relatively high price of such sensors and complex set up. However, price has reduced significantly over the last few years, to match those of longer range ultrasonics, with simplified set up of both techniques also improving ease of use.\n\n==Continuous level measurement of liquids ==\n\n===Magnetostrictive ===\n[[Magnetostrictive]] level sensors are similar to float type sensors in that a permanent magnet sealed inside a float travels up and down a stem in which a magnetostrictive wire is sealed. Ideal for high-accuracy, continuous level measurement of a wide variety of liquids in storage and shipping containers, these sensors require the proper choice of float based on the specific gravity of the liquid. When choosing float and stem materials for magnetostrictive level sensors, the same guidelines described for magnetic and mechanical float level sensors apply.\n\nMagnetostrictive level and position devices charge the magnetostrictive wire with electric current, when the field intersects the floats' magnetic field a mechanical twist or pulse is generated, this travels back down the wire at the speed of sound, like ultrasound or radar the distance is measured\nby time of flight from pulse to return pulse registry. the time of flight corresponds to the distance from the sensor detecting the return pulse.\n\nBecause of the accuracy possible with the magnetostrictive technique, it is popular for \"custody-transfer\" applications. It can be permitted by an agency of weights and measures for conducting commercial transactions. It is also frequently applied on magnetic sight gages. In this variation, the magnet is installed in a float that travels inside a gage glass or tube. The magnet operates on the sensor which is mounted externally on the gage. Boilers and other high temperature or pressure applications take advantage of this performance quality\n\n===Resistive chain===\nResistive chain level sensors are similar to magnetic float level sensors in that a permanent magnet sealed inside a float moves up and down a stem in which closely spaced switches and resistors are sealed. When the switches are closed, the resistance is summed and converted to current or voltage signals that are proportional to the level of the liquid.\n\t\nThe choice of float and stem materials depends on the liquid in terms of chemical compatibility as well as specific gravity and other factors that affect buoyancy. These sensors work well for liquid level measurements in marine, chemical processing, pharmaceuticals, food processing, waste treatment, and other applications. With the proper choice of two floats, resistive chain level sensors can also be used to monitor for the presence of an interface between two immiscible liquids whose specific gravities are more than 0.6, but differ by as little as 0.1 unit.\n\n===Magnetoresistive ===\n[[File:Magneto Resistive Level Sensor.jpg|thumb|Magneto Resistive Level Sensor]]\n[[Magnetoresistance]] float level sensors are similar to float level sensors however a permanent magnet pair is sealed inside the float arm pivot. As the float moves up the motion and location are transmitted as the angular position of the magnetic field. This detection system is highly accurate down to 0.02\u00b0 of motion. The field compass location provides a physical location of the float position. The choice of float and stem materials depends on the liquid in terms of chemical compatibility as well as specific gravity and other factors that affect buoyancy of the float. The electronic monitoring system does not come in contact with the fluid and is considered [[Intrinsic safety]]: or explosion proof.  These sensors work well for liquid level measurements in marine, vehicle, aviation,  chemical processing, pharmaceuticals, food processing, waste treatment, and other applications. \n \nDue to the presence of a microprocessor and  low power consumption, there is also capability for serial communication from to other computing devices making this a good technique for adjusting calibration and filtering of the sensor signal.\n\n===Hydrostatic pressure{{anchor|Pressure}}===\n{{see also|Depth gauge}}\nHydrostatic pressure level sensors are submersible or externally mounted pressure sensors suitable for measuring the level of corrosive liquids in deep tanks or water in reservoirs. Typically, fluid level is determined by the pressure at the bottom of the fluid containment (tank or reservoir); the pressure at the bottom, adjusted for the density / specific gravity of the fluid, indicates the depth of the fluid.<ref name=\"esi_tank_sensors\" /> For these sensors, using chemically compatible materials is important to assure proper performance. Sensors are commercially available from 10&nbsp;mbar to 1000&nbsp;bar. \n\t\nSince these sensors sense increasing pressure with depth and because the specific gravities of liquids are different, the sensor must be properly calibrated for each application. In addition, large variations in temperature cause changes in specific gravity that should be accounted for when the pressure is converted to level. These sensors can be designed to keep the diaphragm free of contamination or build-up, thus ensuring proper operation and accurate hydrostatic pressure level measurements.\n\nFor use in open air applications, where the sensor cannot be mounted to the bottom of the tank or pipe thereof,  a special version of the hydrostatic pressure level sensor, a [[level probe]], can be suspended from a cable into the tank to the bottom point that is to be measured.<ref name=\"esi_tank_sensors\" /> The sensor must be specially designed to seal the electronics from the liquid environment. In tanks with a small head pressure (less than 100 INWC), it is very important to vent the back of the sensor gauge to atmospheric pressure. Otherwise, normal changes in barometric pressure will introduce large error in the sensor output signal. In addition, most sensors need to be compensated for temperature changes in the fluid.\n\n===Air bubbler ===\nAn air bubbler system uses a tube with an opening below the surface of the liquid level. A fixed flow of air is passed through the tube. Pressure in the tube is proportional to the depth (and density) of the liquid over the outlet of the tube.<ref name=\"esi_tank_sensors\" />\n\nAir bubbler systems contain no moving parts, making them suitable for measuring the level of sewage, drainage water, sewage sludge, [[night soil]], or water with large quantities of suspended solids. The only part of the sensor that contacts the liquid is a bubble tube which is chemically compatible with the material whose level is to be measured. Since the point of measurement has no electrical components, the technique is a good choice for classified \"Hazardous Areas\". The control portion of the system can be located safely away, with the pneumatic plumbing isolating the hazardous from the safe area.\n\t\nAir bubbler systems are a good choice for open tanks at atmospheric pressure and can be built so that high-pressure air is routed through a bypass valve to dislodge solids that may clog the bubble tube. The technique is inherently \"self-cleaning\". It is highly recommended for liquid level measurement applications where ultrasonic, float or microwave techniques have proved undependable. The system will require constant supply of air during measurement. The end of the tube should be above certain height to avoid sludge from clogging the tube.\n\n===Gamma ray===\nA nuclear level gauge or gamma ray gauge measures level by the attenuation of gamma rays passing through a process vessel.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Falahati |first1=M. |title=Design, modelling and construction of a continuous nuclear gauge for measuring the fluid levels |journal=Journal of Instrumentation |volume=13 |issue=2 |page=P02028 |doi=10.1088/1748-0221/13/02/P02028 |year=2018 |bibcode=2018JInst..13P2028F }}</ref> The technique is used to regulate the level of molten [[steel]] in a [[continuous casting]] process of steelmaking. The water-cooled mold is arranged with a source of radiation, such as [[cobalt-60]] or [[caesium-137]], on one side and a sensitive detector such as a [[scintillation counter]] on the other. As the level of molten steel rises in the mold, less of the gamma radiation is detected by the sensor. The technique allows non-contact measurement where the heat of the molten metal makes contact techniques and even many non-contact techniques impractical.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Fuel gauge]]\n* [[Level (instrument)]]\n* [[List of sensors]]\n* [[Sight glass]]\n* [[Tide gauge]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n\n{{Sensors}}\n\n[[Category:Sensors]]\n", "text_old": "{{Distinguish|Tilt sensor|Dumpy level|Level of measurement}}\n\n'''Level [[sensors]]''' detect the [[liquid level|level of liquids]] and other [[fluids]] and fluidized solids, including [[slurry|slurries]], [[granular]] materials, and [[wikt:powders|powders]] that exhibit an upper [[free surface]]. Substances that flow become essentially [[horizontal plane|horizontal]] in their containers (or other physical boundaries) because of [[gravity]] whereas most bulk solids pile at an angle of repose to a peak. The substance to be measured can be inside a container or can be in its natural form (e.g., a river or a lake). The level measurement can be either continuous or point values. Continuous level sensors measure level within a specified range and determine the exact amount of substance in a certain place, while point-level sensors only indicate whether the substance is above or below the sensing point. Generally the latter detect levels that are excessively high or low.\n\nThere are many physical and application variables that affect the selection of the optimal level monitoring method for industrial and commercial processes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.engineersgarage.com/articles/what-is-level-sensor|title=Level Sensors|last=EngineersGarage|date=18 September 2012|website=www.engineersgarage.com|language=en|access-date=2018-09-16}}</ref> The selection criteria include the physical: [[phase (matter)|phase]] (liquid, solid or slurry), [[temperature]], [[pressure]] or [[vacuum]], [[chemistry]], [[dielectric constant]] of [[Transmission medium|medium]], [[density]] (specific gravity) of medium, [[agitation (action)]], acoustical or electrical [[noise]], [[vibration]], [[Shock (mechanics)|mechanical shock]], tank or bin size and shape. Also important are the application constraints: price, accuracy, appearance, response rate, ease of [[calibration]] or [[Mathematical programming|programming]], physical size and mounting of the instrument, monitoring or control of continuous or discrete (point) levels.\nIn short, level sensors are one of the very important sensors and play very important role in a variety of consumer/ industrial applications. As with other types of sensors, level sensors are available or can be designed using a variety of sensing principles. Selection of an appropriate type of sensor suiting to the application requirement is very important.\n\n==Point and continuous level detection for solids==\nA variety of sensors are available for point level detection of solids. These include vibrating, rotating paddle, mechanical ([[Diaphragm (mechanical device)|diaphragm]]), [[microwave]] ([[radar]]), capacitance, optical, pulsed-ultrasonic and [[ultrasonic sensor|ultrasonic]] level sensors.\n\n===Vibrating point  ===\n[[File:Sensor prinzip.svg|thumb|Principle of vibration point probe]]\n\nThese detect levels of very fine powders (bulk density: 0.02&nbsp;g/cm<sup>3</sup> \u2013 0.2&nbsp;g/cm<sup>3</sup>), fine powders (bulk density: 0.2&nbsp;g/cm<sup>3</sup> \u2013 0.5&nbsp;g/cm<sup>3</sup>), and granular solids (bulk density: 0.5&nbsp;g/cm<sup>3</sup> or greater). With proper selection of vibration frequency and suitable sensitivity adjustments, they can also sense the level of highly fluidized powders and electrostatic materials.\n\nSingle-probe vibrating level sensors are ideal for bulk powder level. Since only one sensing element contacts the powder, bridging between two probe elements is eliminated and media build-up is minimized. The vibration of the probe tends to eliminate build-up of material on the probe element. Vibrating level sensors are not affected by dust, static charge build-up from dielectric powders, or changes in conductivity, temperature, pressure, humidity or moisture content. Tuning-fork style vibration sensors are another alternative. They tend to be less costly, but are prone to material buildup between the tines,\n\n===Rotating paddle ===\nRotating paddle level sensors are a very old and established technique for bulk solid point level indication. The technique uses a low-speed gear motor that rotates a paddle wheel. When the paddle is stalled by solid materials, the motor is rotated on its shaft by its own torque until a flange mounted on the motor contacts a mechanical switch. The paddle can be constructed from a variety of materials, but tacky material must not be allowed to build up on the paddle. Build-up may occur if the process material becomes tacky because of high moisture levels or high ambient humidity in the hopper. For materials with very low weight per unit volume such as [[Perlite]], [[Bentonite]] or [[fly ash]], special paddle designs and low-torque motors are used. Fine particles or dust must be prevented from penetrating the shaft bearings and motor by proper placement of the paddle in the hopper or bin and using appropriate seals.\n\n===Admittance-type ===\nAn RF admittance level sensor uses a rod probe and RF source to measure the change in [[admittance]]. The probe is driven through a shielded coaxial cable to eliminate the effects of changing cable capacitance to ground. When the level changes around the probe, a corresponding change in the dielectric is observed. This changes the admittance of this imperfect capacitor and this change is measured to detect change of level.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.sapconinstruments.com/fly-ash-level-detection/ | title = Fly Ash Level Detection | author = Sapcon Instruments | accessdate = 2016-09-22}}</ref>\n\n==Point level detection of liquids ==\nTypical systems for point level detection in liquids include magnetic and mechanical floats, pressure sensors, electroconductive sensing or electrostatic (capacitance or inductance) detectors -- and by measurement of a signal's time-of-flight to the fluid surface, through electromagnetic (such as magnetostrictive), ultrasonic, radar or optical sensors.<ref name=\"esi_tank_sensors\">[http://www.leveldevilsensors.com/main/electronic-sensors-inc-esi-level-devil-american-made-tank-monitors-and-tank-monitoring-systems/tabk-sensor/ Tank Sensors & Probes], Electronic Sensors, Inc., retrieved August 8, 2018</ref><ref name=\"dozen_ways_2004_dec_1_sensormag_com\">Henry Hopper, [https://www.sensorsmag.com/components/a-dozen-ways-to-measure-fluid-level-and-how-they-work \"A Dozen Ways to Measure Fluid Level and How They Work,\"] December 1, 2018, ''Sensors Magazine,'' retrieved August 29 2018</ref>\n\n===Magnetic and mechanical float ===\n{{see also|Float (liquid level)|Float switch|Magnetic level gauge}}\n\nThe principle behind magnetic, mechanical, cable, and other float level sensors often involves the opening or closing of a mechanical switch, either through direct contact with the switch, or magnetic operation of a reed. In other instances, such as magnetostrictive sensors, continuous monitoring is possible using a float principle.\n\nWith magnetically actuated float sensors, switching occurs when a permanent magnet sealed inside a float rises or falls to the actuation level. With a mechanically actuated float, switching occurs as a result of the movement of a float against a miniature (micro) switch. For both magnetic and mechanical float level sensors, chemical compatibility, temperature, specific gravity (density), buoyancy, and viscosity affect the selection of the stem and the float. For example, larger floats may be used with liquids with specific gravities as low as 0.5 while still maintaining buoyancy. The choice of float material is also influenced by temperature-induced changes in specific gravity and viscosity \u2013 changes that directly affect buoyancy.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.deeterelectronicsinc.com/ | title = Float Level Sensors | author = Deeter | accessdate = 2009-05-05}}</ref>\n\nFloat-type sensors can be designed so that a shield protects the float itself from turbulence and wave motion. Float sensors operate well in a wide variety of liquids, including corrosives. When used for organic solvents, however, one will need to verify that these liquids are chemically compatible with the materials used to construct the sensor. Float-style sensors should not be used with high viscosity (thick) liquids, sludge or liquids that adhere to the stem or floats, or materials that contain contaminants such as metal chips; other sensing technologies are better suited for these applications.\n\nA special application of float-type sensors is the determination of interface level in oil-water separation systems. Two floats can be used with each float sized to match the specific gravity of the oil on one hand, and the water on the other. Another special application of a stem type float switch is the installation of temperature or pressure sensors to create a multi-parameter sensor. Magnetic float switches are popular for simplicity, dependability and low cost.\n\nA variation of magnetic sensing is the \"[[Hall effect]]\" sensor which utilizes the magnetic sensing of a mechanical gauge's indications.  In a typical application, a magnetism-sensitive \"Hall effect sensor\" is affixed to a mechanical tank gauge that has a magnetized indicator needle, so as to detect the indicating position of the gauge's needle. The magnetic sensor translates the indicator needle position into an electrical signal, allowing other (usually remote) indication or signalling.<ref name=\"esi_tank_sensors\" />\n\n===Pneumatic ===\nPneumatic level sensors are used where hazardous conditions exist, where there is no electric power or its use is restricted, or in applications involving heavy sludge or slurry. As the compression of a column of air against a diaphragm is used to actuate a switch, no process liquid contacts the sensor's [[moving parts]]. These sensors are suitable for use with highly viscous liquids such as grease, as well as water-based and corrosive liquids. This has the additional benefit of being a relatively low cost technique for point level monitoring. A variation of this technique is the \"bubbler\", which compresses air into a tube to the bottom of the tank, until the pressure increase halts as the air pressure gets high enough to expel air bubbles from the bottom of the tube, overcoming the pressure there.  The measurement of the stabilized air pressure indicates the pressure at the bottom of the tank, and, hence, the mass of fluid above.<ref name=\"Roy2013\">{{cite book|author=G. J.

For those conductive liquids that are corrosive, the sensor\u2019s electrodes need to be constructed from titanium, Hastelloy B or C, or 316 stainless steel and insulated with spacers, separators or holders of ceramic, polyethylene and Teflon-based materials. Depending on their design, multiple electrodes of differing lengths can be used with one holder. Since corrosive liquids become more aggressive as temperature and pressure increase, these extreme conditions need to be considered when specifying these sensors.\n    \nConductive level sensors use a low-voltage, current-limited power source applied across separate electrodes. The power supply is matched to the conductivity of the liquid, with higher voltage versions designed to operate in less conductive (higher resistance) mediums. The power source frequently incorporates some aspect of control, such as high-low or alternating pump control. A conductive liquid contacting both the longest probe (common) and a shorter probe (return) completes a conductive circuit. Conductive sensors are extremely safe because they use low voltages and currents. Since the current and voltage used is inherently small, for personal safety reasons, the technique is also capable of being made \"[[Intrinsic safety|Intrinsically Safe]]\" to meet international standards for [[Electrical equipment in hazardous areas|hazardous locations]]. Conductive probes have the additional benefit of being solid-state devices and are very simple to install and use.  In some liquids and applications, maintenance can be an issue. The probe must continue to be conductive. If buildup insulates the probe from the medium, it will stop working properly. A simple inspection of the probe will require an ohmmeter connected across the suspect probe and the ground reference.\n\nTypically, in most water and wastewater wells, the well itself with its ladders, pumps and other metal installations, provides a ground return. However, in chemical tanks, and other non-grounded wells, the installer must supply a ground return, typically an earth rod.\n\n===State dependent frequency monitor===\nA microprocessor controlled frequency state change detection method uses a low amplitude signal generated on multiple sensor probes of differing lengths.  Each probe has a frequency separate from all other probes in the array and independently changes state when touched by water.  The state change of the frequency on each probe is monitored by a microprocessor which can perform multiple water level control functions. \n \nA strength of state dependent frequency monitoring is long term stability of the sensing probes.  The signal strength is not sufficient to cause fouling, degradation, or deterioration of the sensors due to electrolysis in contaminated water.  Sensor cleaning requirements are minimal or eliminated.  Use of multiple sensing rods of different length allows the user to intuitively set up control switches at various water heights.\n\nThe microprocessor in a state dependent frequency monitor can actuate valves and/or large pumps with very low power consumption.  Multiple switch controls can be built in to small package while providing complex, application specific functionality using the microprocessor.  Low power consumption of the controls is consistent across large and small field applications.  This universal technology is used in applications with wide-ranging liquid quality.\n\n==Sensors for both point level detection or continuous monitoring ==\n\n===Ultrasonic ===\n[[File:Ultrasonic level sensor used in a water treatment plant.jpg|thumb|Ultrasonic level sensor used in a water treatment plant]]\n[[Ultrasound|Ultrasonic]] level sensors are used for non-contact level sensing of highly viscous liquids, as well as bulk solids. They are also widely used in water treatment applications for pump control and open channel flow measurement. The sensors emit high frequency (20&nbsp;kHz to 200&nbsp;kHz) acoustic waves that are reflected back to and detected by the emitting transducer.<ref name=\"esi_tank_sensors\" />\n\t\nUltrasonic level sensors are also affected by the changing [[speed of sound]] due to moisture, temperature, and pressures. Correction factors can be applied to the level measurement to improve the accuracy of measurement.\n\nTurbulence, foam, steam, chemical mists (vapors), and changes in the concentration of the process material also affect the ultrasonic sensor\u2019s response. Turbulence and foam prevent the sound wave from being properly reflected to the sensor; steam and chemical mists and vapors distort or absorb the sound wave; and variations in concentration cause changes in the amount of energy in the sound wave that is reflected back to the sensor.  Stilling wells and waveguides are used to prevent errors caused by these factors.\n\nProper mounting of the transducer is required to ensure the best response to reflected sound. In addition, the hopper, bin, or tank should be relatively free of obstacles such as weldments, brackets, or ladders to minimise false returns and the resulting erroneous response, although most modern systems have sufficiently \"intelligent\" echo processing to make engineering changes largely unnecessary except where an intrusion blocks the \"line of sight\" of the transducer to the target. Since the ultrasonic transducer is used both for transmitting and receiving the acoustic energy, it is subject to a period of mechanical vibration known as \"ringing\". This vibration must attenuate (stop) before the echoed signal can be processed. The net result is a distance from the face of the transducer that is blind and cannot detect an object. It is known as the \"blanking zone\", typically 150&nbsp;mm to 1&nbsp;m, depending on the range of the transducer.\n\nThe requirement for electronic signal processing circuitry can be used to make the ultrasonic sensor an intelligent device. Ultrasonic sensors can be designed to provide point level control, continuous monitoring or both. Due to the presence of a microprocessor and relatively low power consumption, there is also the capability for serial communication from to other computing devices making this a good technique for adjusting calibration and filtering of the sensor signal, remote wireless monitoring or plant network communications. The ultrasonic sensor enjoys wide popularity due to the powerful mix of low price and high functionality.\n\n===Capacitance ===\n[[Image:Capacitive sensors NOG.jpg|left]]Capacitance level sensors excel in sensing the presence of a wide variety of solids, aqueous and organic liquids, and slurries.<ref>{{cite web|title=Capacitive Level Sensor|url=http://www.levelsensorsolutions.com/capacitive-level-sensor|website=Level Sensor Solutions|publisher=elobau}}</ref>  The technique is frequently referred to as RF for the radio frequency signals applied to the capacitance circuit. The sensors can be designed to sense material with [[dielectric constant]]s as low as 1.1 (coke and fly ash) and as high as 88 (water) or more. Sludges and slurries such as dehydrated cake and sewage slurry (dielectric constant approx. 50) and liquid chemicals such as quicklime (dielectric constant approx. 90) can also be sensed.<ref name=\"esi_tank_sensors\" /> Dual-probe capacitance level sensors can also be used to sense the interface between two immiscible liquids with substantially different dielectric constants, providing a solid state alternative to the aforementioned magnetic float switch for the \"oil-water interface\" application.\n\nSince capacitance level sensors are electronic devices, phase modulation and the use of higher frequencies makes the sensor suitable for applications in which dielectric constants are similar.  The sensor contains no moving parts, is rugged, simple to use, and easy to clean, and can be designed for high temperature and pressure applications. A danger exists from build-up and discharge of a high-voltage static charge that results from the rubbing and movement of low dielectric materials, but this danger can be eliminated with proper design and grounding.\n\nAppropriate choice of probe materials reduces or eliminates problems caused by abrasion and corrosion. Point level sensing of adhesives and high-viscosity materials such as oil and grease can result in the build-up of material on the probe; however, this can be minimized by using a self-tuning sensor. For liquids prone to foaming and applications prone to splashing or turbulence, capacitance level sensors can be designed with splashguards or stilling wells, among other devices.\n\nA significant limitation for capacitance probes is in tall bins used for storing bulk solids. The requirement for a conductive probe that extends to the bottom of the measured range is problematic. Long conductive cable probes (20 to 50 meters long), suspended into the bin or silo, are subject to tremendous mechanical tension due to the weight of the bulk powder in the silo and the friction applied to the cable. Such installations will frequently result in a cable breakage.\n\n===Optical interface ===\nOptical sensors are used for point level sensing of sediments, liquids with suspended solids, and liquid-liquid interfaces. These sensors sense the decrease or change in transmission of infrared light emitted from an infrared diode (LED). With the proper choice of construction materials and mounting location, these sensors can be used with aqueous, organic, and corrosive liquids. \n\t\nA common application of economical infrared-based optical interface point level sensors is detecting the sludge/water interface in settling ponds. By using pulse modulation techniques and a high power infrared diode, one can eliminate interference from ambient light, operate the LED at a higher gain, and lessen the effects of build-up on the probe.\n\nAn alternate approach for continuous optical level sensing involves the use of a laser. Laser light is more concentrated and therefore is more capable of penetrating dusty or steamy environments. Laser light will reflect off most solid, liquid surfaces. The time of flight can be measured with precise timing circuitry, to determine the range or distance of the surface from the sensor. Lasers remain limited in use in industrial applications due to cost, and concern for maintenance. The optics must be frequently cleaned to maintain performance.\n\n===Microwave ===\nMicrowave sensors are ideal for use in moist, vaporous, and dusty environments as well as in applications in which temperatures and pressures vary. Microwaves (also frequently described as RADAR), will penetrate temperature and vapor layers that may cause problems for other techniques, such as ultrasonic.<ref name=\"esi_tank_sensors\" /> Microwaves are electromagnetic energy and therefore do not require air molecules to transmit the energy making them useful in vacuums.   Microwaves, as electromagnetic energy, are reflected by objects with high conductive properties, like metal and conductive water. Alternately, they are absorbed in various degrees by 'low dielectric' or insulating mediums such as plastics, glass, paper, many powders and food stuffs and other solids.\n\nMicrowave sensors are executed in a wide variety of techniques. Two basic signal processing techniques are applied, each offering its own advantages: Pulsed or Time-Domain Reflectometry (TDR) which is a measurement of time of flight divided by the speed of light, similar to ultrasonic level sensors, and Doppler systems employing FMCW techniques. Just as with ultrasonic level sensors, microwave sensors are executed at various frequencies, from 1&nbsp;GHz to 60&nbsp;GHz.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.senz2.com/project/levelradar|title=Wireless Level Radar - SenZ2 B.V.|author=|date=|website=www.senz2.com}}</ref>  Generally, the higher the frequency, the more accurate, and the more costly. Microwave is executed  non-contact technique or guided. The first is done by monitoring a microwave signal that is transmitted through free space (including vacuum) and reflected back, or can be executed as a \"radar on a wire\" technique, generally known as Guided Wave Radar or Guided Microwave Radar. In the latter technique, performance generally improves in powders and low dielectric media that are not good reflectors of electromagnetic energy transmitted through a void (as in non-contact microwave sensors). But with the guided technique the same mechanical constraints exist that cause problems for the capacitance (RF) techniques mentioned previously by having a probe in the vessel.\n\nNon contact microwave-based radar sensors are able to see through low conductivity 'microwave-transparent' (non-conductive) glass/plastic windows or vessel walls through which the microwave beam can be passed and measure a 'microwave reflective' (conductive) liquid inside (in the same way as to use a plastic bowl in a microwave oven). They are also largely unaffected by high temperature, pressure, vacuum or vibration. As these sensors do not require physical contact with the process material, so the transmitter /receiver can be mounted a safe distance above/from the process, even with an antenna extension of several metres to reduce temperature, yet still respond to the changes in level or distance changes e.g. they are ideal for measurement of molten metal products at over 1200&nbsp;\u00b0C. Microwave transmitters also offer the same key advantage of ultrasonics: the presence of a microprocessor to process the signal, provide numerous monitoring, controls, communications, setup and diagnostic capabilities and are independent of changing density, viscosity and electrical properties. Additionally, they solve some of the application limitations of ultrasonics: operation in high pressure and vacuum, high temperatures, dust, temperature and vapor layers. \nGuided Wave Radars can measure in narrow confined spaces very successfully, as the guide element ensures correct transmission to and from the measured liquid. Applications such as inside stilling tubes or external bridles or cages, offer an excellent alternative to float or displacement devices, as they remove any moving parts or linkages and are unaffected by density changes or build up. They are also excellent with very low microwave reflectivity products like liquid gasses (LNG, LPG, Ammonia) which are stored at low temperatures/high pressures, although care needs to be taken on sealing arrangements and hazardous area approvals. On bulk solids and powders, GWR offers a great alternative to radar or ultrasonic sensors, but some care needs to be taken over cable wear and roof loading by the product movement.\n\nOne perceived major disadvantage of microwave or radar techniques for level monitoring is the relatively high price of such sensors and complex set up. However, price has reduced significantly over the last few years, to match those of longer range ultrasonics, with simplified set up of both techniques also improving ease of use.\n\n==Continuous level measurement of liquids ==\n\n===Magnetostrictive ===\n[[Magnetostrictive]] level sensors are similar to float type sensors in that a permanent magnet sealed inside a float travels up and down a stem in which a magnetostrictive wire is sealed. Ideal for high-accuracy, continuous level measurement of a wide variety of liquids in storage and shipping containers, these sensors require the proper choice of float based on the specific gravity of the liquid. When choosing float and stem materials for magnetostrictive level sensors, the same guidelines described for magnetic and mechanical float level sensors apply.\n\nMagnetostrictive level and position devices charge the magnetostrictive wire with electric current, when the field intersects the floats' magnetic field a mechanical twist or pulse is generated, this travels back down the wire at the speed of sound, like ultrasound or radar the distance is measured\nby time of flight from pulse to return pulse registry. the time of flight corresponds to the distance from the sensor detecting the return pulse.\n\nBecause of the accuracy possible with the magnetostrictive technique, it is popular for \"custody-transfer\" applications. It can be permitted by an agency of weights and measures for conducting commercial transactions. It is also frequently applied on magnetic sight gages. In this variation, the magnet is installed in a float that travels inside a gage glass or tube. The magnet operates on the sensor which is mounted externally on the gage. Boilers and other high temperature or pressure applications take advantage of this performance quality\n\n===Resistive chain===\nResistive chain level sensors are similar to magnetic float level sensors in that a permanent magnet sealed inside a float moves up and down a stem in which closely spaced switches and resistors are sealed. When the switches are closed, the resistance is summed and converted to current or voltage signals that are proportional to the level of the liquid.\n\t\nThe choice of float and stem materials depends on the liquid in terms of chemical compatibility as well as specific gravity and other factors that affect buoyancy. These sensors work well for liquid level measurements in marine, chemical processing, pharmaceuticals, food processing, waste treatment, and other applications. With the proper choice of two floats, resistive chain level sensors can also be used to monitor for the presence of an interface between two immiscible liquids whose specific gravities are more than 0.6, but differ by as little as 0.1 unit.\n\n===Magnetoresistive ===\n[[File:Magneto Resistive Level Sensor.jpg|thumb|Magneto Resistive Level Sensor]]\n[[Magnetoresistance]] float level sensors are similar to float level sensors however a permanent magnet pair is sealed inside the float arm pivot. As the float moves up the motion and location are transmitted as the angular position of the magnetic field. This detection system is highly accurate down to 0.02\u00b0 of motion. The field compass location provides a physical location of the float position. The choice of float and stem materials depends on the liquid in terms of chemical compatibility as well as specific gravity and other factors that affect buoyancy of the float. The electronic monitoring system does not come in contact with the fluid and is considered [[Intrinsic safety]]: or explosion proof.  These sensors work well for liquid level measurements in marine, vehicle, aviation,  chemical processing, pharmaceuticals, food processing, waste treatment, and other applications. \n \nDue to the presence of a microprocessor and  low power consumption, there is also capability for serial communication from to other computing devices making this a good technique for adjusting calibration and filtering of the sensor signal.\n\n===Hydrostatic pressure{{anchor|Pressure}}===\n{{see also|Depth gauge}}\nHydrostatic pressure level sensors are submersible or externally mounted pressure sensors suitable for measuring the level of corrosive liquids in deep tanks or water in reservoirs. Typically, fluid level is determined by the pressure at the bottom of the fluid containment (tank or reservoir); the pressure at the bottom, adjusted for the density / specific gravity of the fluid, indicates the depth of the fluid.<ref name=\"esi_tank_sensors\" /> For these sensors, using chemically compatible materials is important to assure proper performance. Sensors are commercially available from 10&nbsp;mbar to 1000&nbsp;bar. \n\t\nSince these sensors sense increasing pressure with depth and because the specific gravities of liquids are different, the sensor must be properly calibrated for each application. In addition, large variations in temperature cause changes in specific gravity that should be accounted for when the pressure is converted to level. These sensors can be designed to keep the diaphragm free of contamination or build-up, thus ensuring proper operation and accurate hydrostatic pressure level measurements.\n\nFor use in open air applications, where the sensor cannot be mounted to the bottom of the tank or pipe thereof,  a special version of the hydrostatic pressure level sensor, a [[level probe]], can be suspended from a cable into the tank to the bottom point that is to be measured.<ref name=\"esi_tank_sensors\" /> The sensor must be specially designed to seal the electronics from the liquid environment. In tanks with a small head pressure (less than 100 INWC), it is very important to vent the back of the sensor gauge to atmospheric pressure. Otherwise, normal changes in barometric pressure will introduce large error in the sensor output signal. In addition, most sensors need to be compensated for temperature changes in the fluid.\n\n===Air bubbler ===\nAn air bubbler system uses a tube with an opening below the surface of the liquid level. A fixed flow of air is passed through the tube. Pressure in the tube is proportional to the depth (and density) of the liquid over the outlet of the tube.<ref name=\"esi_tank_sensors\" />\n\nAir bubbler systems contain no moving parts, making them suitable for measuring the level of sewage, drainage water, sewage sludge, [[night soil]], or water with large quantities of suspended solids. The only part of the sensor that contacts the liquid is a bubble tube which is chemically compatible with the material whose level is to be measured. Since the point of measurement has no electrical components, the technique is a good choice for classified \"Hazardous Areas\". The control portion of the system can be located safely away, with the pneumatic plumbing isolating the hazardous from the safe area.\n\t\nAir bubbler systems are a good choice for open tanks at atmospheric pressure and can be built so that high-pressure air is routed through a bypass valve to dislodge solids that may clog the bubble tube. The technique is inherently \"self-cleaning\". It is highly recommended for liquid level measurement applications where ultrasonic, float or microwave techniques have proved undependable. The system will require constant supply of air during measurement. The end of the tube should be above certain height to avoid sludge from clogging the tube.\n\n===Gamma ray===\nA nuclear level gauge or gamma ray gauge measures level by the attenuation of gamma rays passing through a process vessel.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Falahati |first1=M. |title=Design, modelling and construction of a continuous nuclear gauge for measuring the fluid levels |journal=Journal of Instrumentation |volume=13 |issue=2 |page=P02028 |doi=10.1088/1748-0221/13/02/P02028 |year=2018 |bibcode=2018JInst..13P2028F }}</ref> The technique is used to regulate the level of molten [[steel]] in a [[continuous casting]] process of steelmaking. The water-cooled mold is arranged with a source of radiation, such as [[cobalt-60]] or [[caesium-137]], on one side and a sensitive detector such as a [[scintillation counter]] on the other. As the level of molten steel rises in the mold, less of the gamma radiation is detected by the sensor. The technique allows non-contact measurement where the heat of the molten metal makes contact techniques and even many non-contact techniques impractical.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Fuel gauge]]\n* [[Level (instrument)]]\n* [[List of sensors]]\n* [[Sight glass]]\n* [[Tide gauge]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n\n{{Sensors}}\n\n[[Category:Sensors]]\n", "name_user": "86.45.96.98", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_sensor"}

As of 2014, an estimated 150,000 people infected with the virus. HIV prevalence is at 1.37 percent in 2014 and is highest in the Eastern Region of Ghana and lowest in the northern regions of the country.

The [[Government of Ghana]] and [[Ghana AIDS Commission]] estimated the number of adults and children living with HIV as of 2014 at 150,000 and prevalence at 1.37% in 2014. The Joint [[United Nations]] Program on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) estimated the HIV prevalence in adults to be 0.9% at the end of 2012, with an estimated 200,000 people living with HIV/AIDS.[https://web.archive.org/web/20080816182420/http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/global_health/aids/Countries/africa/ghana_05.pdf \"Health Profile: Ghana\"].\n \n\nGhana's system of HIV surveillance for women attending antenatal clinics has functioned well since its establishment in 1994. Sentinel surveys of 21 antenatal clinic sites in 2002 reported a range from 3.1% to 9.1% in prevalence among pregnant women. In 2002, the median HIV prevalence at four of these sites in Accra was 4.1%; elsewhere in Ghana, prevalence in antenatal clinics ranged from 3.2% to 3.4% in 2002.\n\n\nHIV prevalence is highest in the Eastern Region of Ghana and lowest in the northern regions of the country. Prevalence is generally higher in urban areas, in mining and border towns, and along main transportation routes. [[HIV-1]] accounts for 92% of HIV cases in Ghana; another 7.4% of reported HIV cases are dual infections with HIV-1 and [[HIV-2#HIV-2|HIV-2]]. Only 0.5% of HIV cases were exclusively HIV-2. [[Heterosexual intercourse]] is the mode of transmission for about 80% of HIV cases, with mother-to-child transmission accounting for another 15%. According to the 2003 Demographic and Health Survey, HIV prevalence is very low among most younger age groups, as relatively few are infected during their youth (with the exceptions of infants infected through their mothers). The infection peaks late, compared to other countries, at 35\u201339 years for women and 40\u201345 years for men. The infection levels are highest in middle income and middle educational groups, with the poor and unemployed less affected. With 1.47% being Ghana's adult prevalence rate it is the 34th country with the highest rate out of 196 countries in the world with Swaziland having the highest rate. That means that Ghana has a pretty good chance of not getting rid of HIV/AIDS from the whole country.

At that time only a few thousand of these children had received assistance such as food aid, health care, protection services, or educational or psychosocial support.\n\nThere is widespread knowledge of HIV and modes of transmission\u2014with awareness of AIDS estimated at greater than 95%\u2014although fear and stigmatization of HIV-positive people remain high.

(See [[Askaryan effect]])\n\n==Biography==\nGurgen Askaryan was born in 1928 in Moscow, Russia to [[Armenians|Armenian]] parents.<ref>\n[http://www.physics.ucla.edu/~moonemp/radhep/talks.html \"Gurgen A. Askaryan (1928-1997)\"], B.M. Bolotovskii.</ref> Both parents were doctors: father Ashot Askaryan, was a general practitioner, and his mother Astgik Askaryan was a dentist. At the age of 18 Gurgen entered the Department of Physics at the [[Moscow State University]], where he started his first research project specializing in the physics of atomic nuclei. Graduated in 1952 and was accepted to the graduate school at the Institute of Chemical Physics (ICP) in Moscow. In 1953, he was transferred to the Lebedev Institute of Physics, and graduated with PHD in 1957. An author of over 200 articles, Askaryan made a significant contribution to the field of [[high energy physics]] (see [[Askaryan effect]] and [[ANtarctic Impulse Transient Antenna|ANITA]] (Antarctic Impulsive Transient Antenna)), [[acoustics]], and [[optics]]. For his famous discovery of the [[self-focusing]] of light, he received the highest scientific award at the time in Soviet Union. Shortly after receiving a degree of the [[Doctor of Science]] in 1992, Gurgen experienced health problems, which were also accompanied by worsening of his sister Gohar's health. He and his sister died the same day on 2 March 1997 in their apartment in Moscow, both because of similar heart disease.\n\n==Scientific career and achievements==\n\n===Past Nobel Prize===\nDuring the third year of his education G. Askaryan proposed a new method of\nregistration of fast charged particles. His idea was the following. Suppose, there\nis an overheated transparent liquid. A very small amount of energy is sufficient to\nmake it boil. Let a fast charged particle penetrate through this overheated liquid.\nThe particle expends its energy on ionization of atoms located near its trajectory.\nThis energy loss is transformed into heat in amount which is sufficient to induce\nboiling along particle's trajectory. Then the trajectory becomes observable because\nmany bubbles are created along it.\n\nG. Askaryan discussed this proposal with some of his teachers and fellow students. No one objected. However, no one supported him, no one helped to realize\nthe idea. G. Askaryan then was inexperienced in forms and methods of scientific\ninvestigation. He even did not publish his proposal. Several years later, in 1952,\nthe same idea was set forth independently by an American physicist [[Donald A. Glaser|Donald Arthur\nGlaser]]. He put the idea into practice having assembled the device known now as\n[[bubble chamber]]. This instrument proved to be so useful in high energy physics\nthat D. A. Glazer was awarded with the [[Nobel Prize]] in 1960. This event gave rise\nto Askaryan's deep concern. Of course, he was shaken that Nobel Prize was so near\nand, so to say, he let it slip. On the other hand, this event helped him to get faith\nin himself.\n\n===Cosmic rays and sound waves===\nG. Askaryan discovered and investigated in details various effects accompanying passage of high energy particles through dense matter (liquids or solids). He showed that hadron-electron-photon showers and even single fast particles may produce sound pulses. Ionization losses are quickly converted into heat, and the small region adjacent to trajectory undergoes quick thermal expansion thus generating sound waves. These results gave a new approach to the study of cosmic rays. Before, investigations of cosmic rays were based on direct interaction of cosmic ray particle with a detector. Askaryan's results made it possible to detect showers and single particles using sound receivers situated at some distance from the event.\n\nSeveral years ago, the registration of energetic particles and showers with sound detectors in sea water was planned as an important part of global monitoring.\n\n===Cosmic rays and electromagnetic waves===\nG. Askaryan also showed that [[cosmic ray]] showers emit electromagnetic radiation, thus giving yet another way for their detection.<ref>'Excess Negative Charge of an Electron-Photon Shower And Its Coherent Radio Emission', Askaryan GA, SOVIET PHYSICS JETP-USSR 14 (2): 441-443 1962</ref> Before him it was commonly assumed that electron-photon showers do not emit electromagnetic radiation since the electrons and positrons are created in pairs. Askaryan's analysis led to the conclusion that in an electron-photon shower there is an excess of negative charge (excess of electrons). These excess electrons are knocked out from atoms either by photoeffect or by shower electrons and positrons (ionization).  At the same time, due to the annihilation process the number of positrons decreases. Thus, there is an electric current created by the excess electrons associated with shower. This variable current is the source of electromagnetic radiation. Therefore, every shower is the source of electromagnetic radiation. These studies opened new perspectives for distant registration of cosmic ray showers.\n\nThese investigations paved the way for distant registration of cosmic ray showers. Now many radio-astronomical stations are conducting observations on cosmic ray showers.\n\n===Intense laser beams and radiation acoustics===\nLater G. Askaryan showed that intense laser beam passing through matter also generates sound waves. This effect may be used for processing and for destruction of matter. As a result of this series of investigations, a new branch of physics was created, radiation acoustics, and G. Askaryan was the founder.\n\n===Interaction of laser beam with substances===\nAfter discovery of lasers, G. Askaryan began to investigate interaction of laser \nbeam with various substances. At that time physicists who worked with lasers,\nused to break through thin metal specimens (usually, razor blades) with laser beam.\nIt was something like a game. G. Askaryan also rendered tribute to this game. He\nnoticed that holes made by laser beam were of two kinds. When he used laser\nof moderate power, the edges of aperture were smooth, as if the aperture was\nmelted through (indeed, it was melted). However, the hole made by powerful laser\nhad rough uneven edges, as if the hole was broken through, not melted. At first\nG. Askaryan supposed that it was the light pressure which knocked out the part of\nrazor blade in the light spot, however, simple estimates showed that the assumption was wrong.\n\nThe problem was later cleared up by G. A. Askaryan and E. M. Moroz. \nThe explanation was the following. The beam from a powerful laser heats metallic surface\nso intensely that surface layer turns into a vapor before the heat penetrates into\nnext layers. The vapor is ejected from the surface. Thereby, a force arises which\nacts on the part of surface within the spot. This force is numerically equal to the\nmomentum of vapor ejected during a unit of time. Such is the reaction of vapor\non the surface. And in the case of powerful laser this reaction is so strong that\nthe metal within the spot is torn out. The reaction of the vapor gives pressure\nthat is many orders greater than the light pressure. Vaporizing ablation is now\nused for compressing the nuclear fuel in the problem of laser induced controlled\nthermonuclear reactions.\n\n===Self-focusing of waves===\nPerhaps one of the most brilliant of Askaryan's discoveries was the [[self-focusing]] of light.<ref>Effects of the Gradient of Strong Electromagnetic Beam on Electrons and Atoms: Askaryan GA, SOVIET PHYSICS JETP-USSR 15 (6): 1088-1090 1962</ref><ref>Self-Focusing of a Light Beam Upon Excitation of Atoms And Molecules of Medium In Beam: Askaryan GA, JETP LETTERS-USSR 4 (10): 270 1966</ref><ref>Self-Focusing and Focusing of Ultrasound and Hypersound:Askaryan GA, JETP LETTERS-USSR 4 (4): 99& 1966</ref> In the medium with third order nonlinear polarization, the refractive index can be represented as n = n<sub>0</sub> + n<sub>2</sub>I, where n<sub>0</sub> is the linear refractive index, n<sub>2</sub> is an optical constant characterizing the strength of the optical nonlinearity, and I is the Gaussian intensity profile of the beam. The phenomenon of self-focusing may occur if a beam of light with nonuniform transverse intensity distribution, for example Gaussian profile, propagates through a material in which n<sub>2</sub> is positive.<ref>Nonlinear Optics: Robert Boyd, Academic Press 1992</ref> If a strong beam of light passes through a medium with this type of nonlinearity also called [[Kerr effect|Kerr]] nonlinearity, then the refractive index of the medium inside the beam is greater than that outside of the beam. If the electric field is strong enough then the beam will create a dielectric waveguide, which reduces or entirely eliminates the divergence of the beam. Askaryan called this effect [[self-focusing]]. Discovery of self-focusing opened a new chapter in non-linear electrodynamics and optics.\n\n===Askaryan effect===\nThe [[Askaryan effect]], which was theoretically predicted by Askaryan in 1962, describes a phenomenon, similar to the Cherenkov effect, whereby a particle travelling faster than the speed of light in a dense radiotransparent medium such as salt, ice or the lunar regolith produces a shower of secondary charged particles which contain a charge anisotropy and thus emits a cone of coherent radiation in the radio or microwave part of the electromagnetic spectrum. This phenomenon is of primary interest in using bulk matter to detect ultra-high energy neutrinos.\n\n===Other===\nAskaryan was the first to note that the outer few metres of the Moon's surface, known as the regolith, would be a sufficiently transparent medium for detecting microwaves from the charge excess in particle showers. The radio transparency of the regolith has since been confirmed by the Apollo missions.<ref>http://cerncourier.com/cws/article/cern/28411</ref>\n\nAskaryan also found (together with M. L. Levin) a combination of auxiliary high-frequency elds which could secure stability of electron bunch during acceleration.\n\n==Selected works==\nSource: [http://www.isiknowledge.com/ ISI Web of

Askaryan\u2019s results made it possible to detect showers and single particles using sound receivers situated at some distance from the event.\n\nSeveral years ago, the registration of energetic particles and showers with sound detectors in sea water was planned as an important part of global monitoring.\n\n===Cosmic rays and electromagnetic waves===\nG. Askaryan also showed that [[cosmic ray]] showers emit electromagnetic radiation, thus giving yet another way for their detection.<ref>'Excess Negative Charge of an Electron-Photon Shower And Its Coherent Radio Emission', Askaryan GA, SOVIET PHYSICS JETP-USSR 14 (2): 441-443 1962</ref> Before him it was commonly assumed that electron-photon showers do not emit electromagnetic radiation since the electrons and positrons are created in pairs. Askaryan\u2019s analysis led to the conclusion that in an electron-photon shower there is an excess of negative charge (excess of electrons). These excess electrons are knocked out from atoms either by photoeffect or by shower electrons and positrons (ionization).  At the same time, due to the annihilation process the number of positrons decreases. Thus, there is an electric current created by the excess electrons associated with shower. This variable current is the source of electromagnetic radiation. Therefore, every shower is the source of electromagnetic radiation. These studies opened new perspectives for distant registration of cosmic ray showers.\n\nThese investigations paved the way for distant registration of cosmic ray showers. Now many radio-astronomical stations are conducting observations on cosmic ray showers.\n\n===Intense laser beams and radiation acoustics===\nLater G. Askaryan showed that intense laser beam passing through matter also generates sound waves. This effect may be used for processing and for destruction of matter. As a result of this series of investigations, a new branch of physics was created, radiation acoustics, and G. Askaryan was the founder.\n\n===Interaction of laser beam with substances===\nAfter discovery of lasers, G. Askaryan began to investigate interaction of laser \nbeam with various substances. At that time physicists who worked with lasers,\nused to break through thin metal specimens (usually, razor blades) with laser beam.\nIt was something like a game. G. Askaryan also rendered tribute to this game. He\nnoticed that holes made by laser beam were of two kinds. When he used laser\nof moderate power, the edges of aperture were smooth, as if the aperture was\nmelted through (indeed, it was melted). However, the hole made by powerful laser\nhad rough uneven edges, as if the hole was broken through, not melted. At first\nG. Askaryan supposed that it was the light pressure which knocked out the part of\nrazor blade in the light spot, however, simple estimates showed that the assumption was wrong.\n\nThe problem was later cleared up by G. A. Askaryan and E. M. Moroz. \nThe explanation was the following. The beam from a powerful laser heats metallic surface\nso intensely that surface layer turns into a vapor before the heat penetrates into\nnext layers. The vapor is ejected from the surface. Thereby, a force arises which\nacts on the part of surface within the spot. This force is numerically equal to the\nmomentum of vapor ejected during a unit of time. Such is the reaction of vapor\non the surface. And in the case of powerful laser this reaction is so strong that\nthe metal within the spot is torn out. The reaction of the vapor gives pressure\nthat is many orders greater than the light pressure. Vaporizing ablation is now\nused for compressing the nuclear fuel in the problem of laser induced controlled\nthermonuclear reactions.\n\n===Self-focusing of waves===\nPerhaps one of the most brilliant of Askaryan\u2019s discoveries was the [[self-focusing]] of light.<ref>Effects of the Gradient of Strong Electromagnetic Beam on Electrons and Atoms: Askaryan GA, SOVIET PHYSICS JETP-USSR 15 (6): 1088-1090 1962</ref><ref>Self-Focusing of a Light Beam Upon Excitation of Atoms And Molecules of Medium In Beam: Askaryan GA, JETP LETTERS-USSR 4 (10): 270 1966</ref><ref>Self-Focusing and Focusing of Ultrasound and Hypersound:Askaryan GA, JETP LETTERS-USSR 4 (4): 99& 1966</ref> In the medium with third order nonlinear polarization, the refractive index can be represented as n = n<sub>0</sub> + n<sub>2</sub>I, where n<sub>0</sub> is the linear refractive index, n<sub>2</sub> is an optical constant characterizing the strength of the optical nonlinearity, and I is the Gaussian intensity profile of the beam. The phenomenon of self-focusing may occur if a beam of light with nonuniform transverse intensity distribution, for example Gaussian profile, propagates through a material in which n<sub>2</sub> is positive.<ref>Nonlinear Optics: Robert Boyd, Academic Press 1992</ref> If a strong beam of light passes through a medium with this type of nonlinearity also called [[Kerr effect|Kerr]] nonlinearity, then the refractive index of the medium inside the beam is greater than that outside of the beam. If the electric field is strong enough then the beam will create a dielectric waveguide, which reduces or entirely eliminates the divergence of the beam. Askaryan called this effect [[self-focusing]]. Discovery of self-focusing opened a new chapter in non-linear electrodynamics and optics.\n\n===Askaryan effect===\nThe [[Askaryan effect]], which was theoretically predicted by Askaryan in 1962, describes a phenomenon, similar to the Cherenkov effect, whereby a particle travelling faster than the speed of light in a dense radiotransparent medium such as salt, ice or the lunar regolith produces a shower of secondary charged particles which contain a charge anisotropy and thus emits a cone of coherent radiation in the radio or microwave part of the electromagnetic spectrum. This phenomenon is of primary interest in using bulk matter to detect ultra-high energy neutrinos.\n\n===Other===\nAskaryan was the first to note that the outer few metres of the Moon's surface, known as the regolith, would be a sufficiently transparent medium for detecting microwaves from the charge excess in particle showers. The radio transparency of the regolith has since been confirmed by the Apollo missions.<ref>http://cerncourier.com/cws/article/cern/28411</ref>\n\nAskaryan also found (together with M. L. Levin) a combination of auxiliary high-frequency elds which could secure stability of electron bunch during acceleration.\n\n==Selected works==\nSource: [http://www.isiknowledge.com/ ISI Web of

Prior to The Walkmen's formation, Leithauser and bass guitarist and organist [[Peter Matthew Bauer]] were both members of The Recoys.   Leithauser was born and raised in Washington, DC and has lived in New York City since the 1990s.\n\nLeithauser embarked upon a solo career in 2014, releasing his debut studio album, ''[[Black Hours (album)|Black Hours]]'', on June 3. Written and recorded alongside his Walkmen bandmate Paul Maroon. The duo independently released a follow-up vinly-only LP (''Dear God'') and EP (''I Could Have Sworn'') under both of their names the following year.\n\nIn 2016, Leithauser collaborated with former [[Vampire Weekend]] multi-instrumentalist [[Rostam Batmanglij]] on the studio album, ''[[I Had a Dream That You Were Mine]]''.

The narrations generally state that in March 632, Muhammad, while returning from his [[Farewell Pilgrimage]] alongside a large number of followers and companions, stopped at the oasis of Ghadir Khumm. There, he took Ali's hand and addressed the gathering. The point of contention between different sects is when Muhammad, whilst giving his speech, gave the proclamation \"Anyone who has me as his ''[[mawla]]'', has Ali as his ''mawla.''\" Some versions add the additional sentence \"O God, befriend the friend of Ali and be the enemy of his enemy.\"<ref name=Amir-Moezzi>{{cite journal |title=\"Ghad\u012br Khumm\" in: Encyclopaedia of Islam THREE|last1=Amir-Moezzi |first1=Mohammad Ali |editor1=Kate Fleet|editor2=Gundrun Kr\u00e4mer|editor-link2=Gudrun Kr\u00e4mer|editor3=Denis Matringe|editor4=John Nawas|editor5=Everett Rowson|authorlink1=Mohammad Ali Amir-Moezzi |date=2014 |ref=harv|doi = 10.1163/1573-3912_ei3_COM_27419}}</ref>\n\n''Mawla'' has a number of meanings in [[Arabic]], with interpretations of Muhammad's use here being split along sectarian lines between the Sunni and Shia. Among the former group, the word is translated as \"friend\" or \"one who is loyal/close\" and that Muhammad was advocating that Ali was deserving of friendship and respect.

While they were preparing his body, [[Abu Bakr]], [[Umar]], and [[Abu Ubaidah ibn al Jarrah]] met with the leaders of Medina and elected Abu Bakr as caliph. Ali did not accept the caliphate of [[Abu Bakr]] and refused to pledge allegiance to him. This is indicated in both [[Sunni]] and [[Shia]] ''sahih'' and authentic Hadith.\n\n[[File:Al-Kadhimiya Mosque, Kadhmain Shrine.jpg|300px|thumb|Left|[[Al-Kadhimiya Mosque]]]]\n[[Ibn Qutaybah]], a 9th-century [[Sunni]] Islamic scholar narrates of [[Ali]]:<blockquote>I am the servant of God and the brother of the Messenger of God. I am thus more worthy of this office than you. I shall not give allegiance to you [Abu Bakr & Umar] when it is more proper for you to give bay\u02bcah to me. You have seized this office from the Ansar using your tribal relationship to the Prophet as an argument against them. Would you then seize this office from us, the ahl al-bayt by force? Did you not claim before the Ansar that you were more worthy than they of the caliphate because Muhammad came from among you (but Muhammad was never from AbuBakr family) \u2013 and thus they gave you leadership and surrendered command? I now contend against you with the same argument\u2026It is we who are more worthy of the Messenger of God, living or dead. Give us our due right if you truly have faith in God, or else bear the charge of wilfully doing wrong... Umar, I will not yield to your commands: I shall not pledge loyalty to him.' Ultimately Abu Bakr said, \"O 'Ali! If you do not desire to give your bay'ah, I am not going to force you for the same.</blockquote>[[Ali]]'s wife, and daughter of [[Muhammad]], [[Fatimah]], refused to pledge allegiance to [[Abu Bakr]] and remained angry with him until she died due to the issues of [[Fadak]] and her inheritance from her father and the situation of [[Umar at Fatimah's house]]. This is stated in sahih Sunni Hadith, [[Sahih Bukhari]] and Sahih Muslim. [[Fatimah]] did not at all pledge allegiance or acknowledge or accept the caliphate of [[Abu Bakr]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://sunnah.com/search/?q=After+the+death+of+Allah+%27s+Apostle+Fatima+the+daughter+of+Allah%27s+Apostle+asked+Abu+Bakr+As-Siddiq+to+give+her,+her+share+of+inheritance+from+what+Allah%27s+Apostle+had+|title=After the death of Allah 's Apostle Fatima the daughter of Allah's Apostle asked Abu Bakr As-Siddiq to give her, her share of inheritance from what Allah's Apostle had (p. 1) \u2013 Sunnah.com \u2013 Sayings and Teachings of Prophet Muhammad (\u0635\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0647 \u0648 \u0633\u0644\u0645)|publisher=|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171010055547/https://sunnah.com/search/?q=After+the+death+of+Allah+%27s+Apostle+Fatima+the+daughter+of+Allah%27s+Apostle+asked+Abu+Bakr+As-Siddiq+to+give+her%2C+her+share+of+inheritance+from+what+Allah%27s+Apostle+had+|archivedate=10 October 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Almost all of [[Banu Hashim]], [[Muhammad]]'s clan and many of the ''sahaba'', had supported [[Ali]]'s cause after the demise of the prophet whilst others supported [[Abu Bakr]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.al-islam.org/history-shiism-advent-islam-end-minor-occultation-muharrami/lesson-8-shiah-among-companions-sahabah|title=Lesson 8: The Shi\u02bbah among the Companions {sahabah}|website=Al-Islam.org|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170729024723/https://www.al-islam.org/history-shiism-advent-islam-end-minor-occultation-muharrami/lesson-8-shiah-among-companions-sahabah|archivedate=29 July 2017|df=dmy-all|date=February 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.al-islam.org/house-sorrows-life-sayyidah-fatimah-al-zahra-and-her-grief-shaykh-abbas-qummi/chapter-3-state|title=Chapter 3: State of Affairs in Saqifah after the Death of the Prophet|website=Al-Islam.org|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170729151253/https://www.al-islam.org/house-sorrows-life-sayyidah-fatimah-al-zahra-and-her-grief-shaykh-abbas-qummi/chapter-3-state|archivedate=29 July 2017|df=dmy-all|date=21 April 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.islamicinsights.com/religion/clergy-corner/did-imam-ali-give-allegiance-to-abu-bakr.html|title=Did Imam Ali Give Allegiance to Abu Bakr?|publisher= Islamic Insights|date=8 December 2009|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170628084915/http://www.islamicinsights.com/religion/clergy-corner/did-imam-ali-give-allegiance-to-abu-bakr.html|archivedate=28 June 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>Riz\u0324v\u012b, Sayyid Sa'eed Ak\u0332h\u0332tar.

In 680 CE, Muawiyah died and passed the caliphate to his son [[Yazid I|Yazid]], and breaking the treaty with Hasan ibn Ali. Yazid asked Husayn to swear allegiance (''[[bay'ah]]'') to him. Ali's faction, having expected the caliphate to return to Ali's line upon Muawiyah's death, saw this as a betrayal of the peace treaty and so Husayn rejected this request for allegiance. There was a groundswell of support in Kufa for Husayn to return there and take his position as caliph and imam, so Husayn collected his family and followers in Medina and set off for Kufa. En route to Kufa, he was blocked by an army of Yazid's men (which included people from Kufa) near Karbala (modern Iraq), and Husayn and approximately 72 of his family and followers were killed in the [[Battle of Karbala]].\n\nThe Shia regard Husayn as a martyr (''[[shahid]]''), and count him as an Imam from the Ahl al-Bayt.

For instance, the collection of hadith venerated by Shia Muslims is centered on narrations by members of the Ahl al-Bayt and their supporters, while some hadith by narrators not belonging to or supporting the Ahl al-Bayt are not included. Those of [[Abu Hurairah]], for example, Ibn Asakir in his Ta'rikh Kabir and Muttaqi in his Kanzu'l-Umma report that Caliph Umar lashed him, rebuked him and forbade him to narrate hadith from Muhammad. Umar said: \"Because you narrate hadith in large numbers from the Holy Prophet, you are fit only for attributing lies to him. (That is, one expects a wicked man like you to utter only lies about the Holy Prophet.) So you must stop narrating hadith from the Prophet; otherwise, I will send you to the land of Dus.\" (A clan in Yemen, to which Abu Huraira belonged.) According to Sunnis, Ali was the fourth successor to Abu Bakr, while the Shia maintain that Ali was the first divinely sanctioned \"Imam\", or successor of Muhammad. The seminal event in Shia history is the martyrdom in 680 CE at the [[Battle of Karbala]] of Ali's son [[Hussein ibn Ali]], who led a non-allegiance movement against the defiant caliph (71 of Hussein's followers were killed as well).\nIt is believed in Twelver and Ismaili Shia Islam that [['aql]], divine wisdom, was the source of the souls of the prophets and imams and gave them esoteric knowledge called ''\u1e25ikmah'' and that their sufferings were a means of divine grace to their devotees.<ref>Corbin 1993, pp. 45\u201351</ref><ref>Nasr (1979), p. 15</ref> Although the imam was not the recipient of a [[wahy|divine revelation]], he had a close relationship with God, through which God guides him, and the imam, in turn, guides the people.

Twelver Shia are also known as ''Imami'' or ''Ja'fari'', originated from the name of the 6th Imam, Ja'far al-Sadiq, who elaborated the twelver jurisprudence.<ref>{{harvnb|Cornell|2007|p=237}}</ref>\n\nTwelvers constitute the majority of the population in [[Iran]] (90%),<ref>\"Esposito, John. \"What Everyone Needs to Know about Islam\" Oxford University Press, 2002. {{ISBN|978-0-19-515713-0}}. p. 45.</ref> Azerbaijan (85%),<ref name=\"Britannica738\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://files.preslib.az/projects/remz/pdf_en/atr_din.pdf|title=Administrative Department of the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan \u2013 Presidential Library \u2013 Religion|publisher=|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111123084541/http://files.preslib.az/projects/remz/pdf_en/atr_din.pdf|archivedate=23 November 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Bahrain (70%), Iraq (65%), Lebanon (65% of Muslims).<ref name=\"esp45\">Esposito, John. \"What Everyone Needs to Know about Islam\" Oxford University Press, 2002. {{ISBN|978-0-19-515713-0}}. p. 45</ref><ref name=\"glob\">{{cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/gulf/bahrain-religion.htm|title=Bahrain \u2013 Religion|author=John Pike|work=globalsecurity.org|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118214401/http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/gulf/bahrain-religion.htm|archivedate=18 January 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name=review>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurasiareview.com/25032011-challenges-for-saudi-arabia-amidst-protests-in-the-gulf-analysis/|title=Challenges For Saudi Arabia Amidst Protests In The Gulf \u2013 Analysis|work=Eurasia Review|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401034318/http://www.eurasiareview.com/25032011-challenges-for-saudi-arabia-amidst-protests-in-the-gulf-analysis/|archivedate=1 April 2012|df=dmy-all|date=25 March 2011}}</ref>\n\n====Doctrine====\n[[File:Names of imameen.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Names of all 12 Imams (descendants of Imam Ali) written in the form of [[Language|Arabic]] name '''\u0639\u0644\u0649 ''' 'Ali']]\nTwelver doctrine is based on [[Theology of Twelvers|five principles]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/shiite-doctrine|title=Shi\u02bfite Doctrine|work=iranicaonline.org|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150517022711/http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/shiite-doctrine|archivedate=17 May 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref> These five principles known as ''Usul ad-Din'' are as follow:<ref>Joanne Richter, (2006), [https://books.google.com/books?id=X9fxXEdeIP8C&pg=PA7 ''Iran the Culture''], p. 7</ref><ref>Mulla Bashir Rahim, ''[http://www.al-islam.org/begin/intro/rahim.html An Introduction to Islam] {{webarchive|url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20091014001501/http://www.al-islam.org/begin/intro/rahim.html |date=14 October 2009 }}'', by [[Ahlul Bayt Digital Islamic Library Project]]</ref>\n# '''[[Tawhid|Monotheism]]''', God is one and unique.\n# '''[[Adl|Justice]]''', the concept of moral rightness based on ethics, fairness, and equity, along with the punishment of the breach of these ethics.\n# '''[[Nubuwwah|Prophethood]]''', the institution by which God sends emissaries, or prophets, to guide mankind.\n# '''[[Imamate|Leadership]]''', a divine institution which succeeded the institution of Prophethood. Its appointees (imams) are divinely appointed.\n# '''Last Judgment''', God's final assessment of humanity.\n\nMore specifically, these principles are known as Usul al-Madhhab (principles of the Shia sect) according to Twelver Shias which differ from Daruriyat al-Din (Necessities of Religion) which are principles in order for one to be a Muslim. The Necessities of Religion do not include Leadership (Imamah) as it is not a requirement in order for one to be recognized as a Muslim. However, this category, according to Twelver scholars like Ayatollah al-Khoei, does include belief in God, Prophethood, the Day of Resurrection and other \"necessities\" (like belief in angels). In this regard, Twelver Shias draw a distinction in terms of believing in the main principles of Islam on the one hand, and specifically Shia doctrines like Imamah on the other.\n\n====Books====\nBesides the Quran which is common to all Muslims, the Shia derive guidance from books of traditions (\"\u1e25ad\u012bth\") attributed to Muhammad and the Twelve Imams. Below is a list of some of the most prominent of these books:\n* [[Nahj al-Balagha]] by [[Ali ibn Abi Talib]] \u2013 the most famous collection of sermons, letters & narration by the first Imam regarded by Shias\n* [[al-Kafi]] by [[Muhammad ibn Ya'qub al-Kulayni]]<ref>{{cite book|last=Islamic Texts Institute|title=Al-Kafi Book I: Intellect and Foolishness|year=2012|publisher=Taqwa Media|isbn=978-1-939420-00-8}}</ref>\n* Wasa'il al-Shi\u02bbah by al-Hurr al-Amili\n\n====The Twelve Imams====\n{{see also|The Twelve Imams|Hadith of the Twelve Successors|l2=Sunni reports about there being 12 successors to the Prophet}}\nThe ''Twelve Imams'' are the spiritual and political successors to Muhammad for the Twelvers.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} According to the theology of Twelvers, the successor of Muhammad is an [[Ismah|infallible]] human individual who not only rules over the community with justice but also is able to keep and interpret the divine law and its esoteric meaning. The words and deeds of Muhammad and the imams are a guide and model for the community to follow; as a result, they must be free from error and sin, and Imams must be chosen by divine decree, or ''nass'', through Muhammad.<ref name=\"Nasr_a\" /><ref name=\"Momen 1985, p. 174\"/> Each imam was the son of the previous imam, with the exception of [[Husayn ibn Ali|Hussein ibn Ali]], who was the brother of Hasan ibn Ali.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} The twelfth and final imam is Muhammad al-Mahdi, who is believed by the Twelvers to be currently alive and in occultation.<ref name=\"Imamat\"/>\n\n====Jurisprudence====\n{{main|Ja'fari jurisprudence}}\n{{see also|Shia clergy}}\nThe Twelver jurisprudence is called ''Ja'fari jurisprudence''. In this [[jurisprudence]] ''Sunnah'' is considered to be the oral traditions of Muhammad and their implementation and interpretation by the twelve Imams. There are three schools of Ja'fari jurisprudence: Usuli, Akhbari, and [[Shaykhism|Shaykhi]]. The Usuli school is by far the largest of the three. Twelver groups that do not follow Ja'fari jurisprudence include [[Alevi]], [[Bektashi Order|Bektashi]], and [[Qizilbash]].\n\nThe five primary pillars of Islam to the Ja'fari jurisprudence, known as ''Usul' ad-Din''. They are at variance with the standard Sunni \"five pillars of religion.\"  The Shia's primary \"pillars\" are:\n\n# ''[[Tawhid]]'' or oneness of God.\n# ''[[Nabuwa]]'' prophethood of Muhammad.\n# ''[[Mu'ad]]'' resurrection.\n# ''[[Adl]]''  justice (of God)\n# ''[[Imama]]''  the rightful place of the Shia Imams\n\nIn Ja'fari jurisprudence, there are eight secondary pillars, known as ''Furu' ad-Din'', which are as follows:<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=X9fxXEdeIP8C&pg=PA7 ''Iran the Culture''] Joanne Richter (2007), p. 7</ref>\n# ''[[salat|Prayer]]''\n# ''[[Sawm|Fasting]]''\n# ''[[Hajj|Pilgrimage]]'' to [[Mecca]]\n# ''[[Zak\u0101t|Alms giving]]''\n# ''[[Jihad|Struggle]]'' for the righteous cause\n# ''[[Ma'ruf|Directing others towards good]]''\n# ''[[Forbidding what is evil|Directing others away from evil]]''\n# ''[[Khums]])'' (20% tax on savings yearly, {after deduction of commercial expenses.})\n\nAccording to Twelvers, defining and interpretation of Islamic jurisprudence is the responsibility of Muhammad and the twelve Imams. As the 12th Imam is in occultation, it is the duty of clerics to refer to the Islamic literature such as the Quran and hadith and identify legal decisions within the confines of Islamic law to provide means to deal with current issues from an Islamic perspective. In other words, Twelver clerics provide Guardianship of the Islamic Jurisprudence, which was defined by Muhammad and his twelve successors.

Followers of the Zaidi [[fiqh]] are called Zaidis (or occasionally '''Fivers'''). However, there is also a group called ''Zaidi Was\u012bt\u012bs'' who are Twelvers (see below).

Zaidis also do not believe that the Imamate must pass from father to son but believe it can be held by any [[Sayyid]] descended from either Hasan ibn Ali or Hussein ibn Ali (as was the case after the death of Hasan ibn Ali). Historically, Zaidis held that Zayd was the rightful successor of the 4th imam since he led a rebellion against the Umayyads in protest of their tyranny and corruption. Muhammad al-Baqir did not engage in political action, and the followers of Zayd believed that a true imam must fight against corrupt rulers.\n\n====Jurisprudence====\nIn matters of [[Fiqh|Islamic jurisprudence]], the Zaydis follow Zayd ibn Ali's teachings which are documented in his book ''Majmu'l Fiqh'' (in [[Arabic language|Arabic]]: {{big|\u0645\u062c\u0645\u0648\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0650\u0642\u0647}}).

With the eventual development of Twelverism into the more literalistic ''([[Zahir (Islam)|zahir]])'' oriented Akhbari and later Usuli schools of thought, Shiaism developed in two separate directions: the metaphorical Ismailli group focusing on the [[mysticism|mystical]] path and nature of God and the divine manifestation in the personage of the \"Imam of the Time\" as the \"Face of God\", with the more literalistic Twelver group focusing on divine law (''shar\u012b'ah'') and the deeds and sayings (''sunnah'') of Muhammad and his successors (the ''Ahlu l-Bayt''), who as A'immah were guides and a light to God.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www-personal.umich.edu/~jrcole/ahsai1.htm | title = Shaykh Ahmad al-Ahsa'i | accessdate = 25 April 2007 | url-status=live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070218072512/http://www-personal.umich.edu/~jrcole/ahsai1.htm | archivedate = 18 February 2007 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThough there are several sub-groupings within the Ismailis, the term in today's vernacular generally refers to the Shia Imami Ismaili Muslim ([[Nizari]] community), generally known as the Ismailis, who are followers of the [[Aga Khan]] and the largest group among the Ismailiyyah.

Born in 386 AH (985), he ascended as ruler at the age of eleven. The typical religiously tolerant Fatimid Empire saw much persecution under his reign. When in 411 AH (1021) his mule returned without him, soaked in blood, a religious group that was forming in his lifetime broke off from mainstream Ismailism and did not acknowledge his successor.

The Imam of the Age defines the jurisprudence, and his guidance may differ with Imams previous to him because of different times and circumstances. For Nizari Ismailis, the Imam is Karim al-Husayni [[Aga Khan IV]]. The Nizari line of Imams has continued to this day as an unending line.\n\nDivine leadership has continued in the Bohra branch through the institution of the \"Unrestricted Missionary\" [[List of Dai of Dawoodi Bohra|Dai]]. According to Bohra tradition, before the last Imam, At-Tayyib Abi l-Qasim, went into seclusion, his father, the 20th Al-Amir bi-Ahkami l-Lah, had instructed [[Al-Hurra Al-Malika]] the [[Malik]]a ([[Queen consort]]) in Yemen to appoint a vicegerent after the seclusion\u2014the ''Unrestricted Missionary'', who as the Imam's vicegerent has full authority to govern the community in all matters both spiritual and temporal while the lineage of Mustaali-Tayyibi Imams remains in seclusion (Dawr-e-Satr). The three branches of the Mustaali, the [[Alavi Bohra]], [[Sulaymani|Sulaimani Bohra]] and [[Dawoodi Bohra]], differ on who the current Unrestricted Missionary is.\n\n==Other doctrines==\n\n===Doctrine about necessity of acquiring knowledge===\nAccording to Allameh [[Muhammad Rida al-Muzaffar|Muzaffar]] God gives humans the faculty of reason and argument. Also, God orders humans to spend time thinking carefully on creation while he refers to all creations as his signs of power and glory. These signs encompass all of the universe. Furthermore, there is a similarity between humans as the little world and the universe as the large world. God does not accept the faith of those who follow him without thinking and only with imitation, but also God blames them for such actions.\nIn other words, humans have to think about the universe with reason and intellect, a faculty bestowed on us by God.  Since there is more insistence on the faculty of intellect among Shia, even evaluating the claims of someone who claims prophecy is on the basis of intellect.<ref>{{cite book|author=Allamah Muhammad Rida Al Muzaffar|title=The faith of Shia Islam|year=1989|page=1|publisher=Ansariyan Qum}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.introducingislam.org/info/muzaffar/chapter1.php|title=The Beliefs of Shia Islam \u2013 Chapter 1|publisher=|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161025175646/http://www.introducingislam.org/info/muzaffar/chapter1.php|archivedate=25 October 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Doctrine concerning Du'a===\n\nPraying or Du\u02bca in Shia has an important place as Muhammad described it as a weapon of the believer. In fact, Du\u02bca considered as something that is a feature of Shia community in a sense. Performing Du\u02bca in Shia has a special ritual. Because of this, there are many books written on the conditions of praying among Shia.

Some sources, such as the ''[[Musnad Ahmad ibn Hanbal]]'', do not record Muhammad's reaction to this, though Ibn Ishaq continues that he then declared Ali to be his brother, heir and successor.<ref>{{harvtxt|Rubin|1995|p=137}}</ref> In another narration, when Muhammad accepted Ali's offer, he \"threw up his arms around the generous youth, and pressed him to his bosom\" and said, \"Behold my brother, my vizir, my vicegerent&nbsp;... let all listen to his words, and obey him.\"<ref>{{citation|last=Irving|first=Washington|authorlink=Washington Irving|title=Mahomet and His Successors|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AlMLAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA71|volume=I|year=1868|publisher=G.

The narrations generally state that in March 632, Muhammad, while returning from his [[Farewell Pilgrimage]] alongside a large number of followers and companions, stopped at the oasis of Ghadir Khumm. There, he took Ali's hand and addressed the gathering. The point of contention between different sects is when Muhammad, whilst giving his speech, gave the proclamation \"Anyone who has me as his ''[[mawla]]'', has Ali as his ''mawla.''\" Some versions add the additional sentence \"O God, befriend the friend of Ali and be the enemy of his enemy.\"<ref name=Amir-Moezzi>{{cite journal |title=\"Ghad\u012br Khumm\" in: Encyclopaedia of Islam THREE|last1=Amir-Moezzi |first1=Mohammad Ali |editor1=Kate Fleet|editor2=Gundrun Kr\u00e4mer|editor-link2=Gudrun Kr\u00e4mer|editor3=Denis Matringe|editor4=John Nawas|editor5=Everett Rowson|authorlink1=Mohammad Ali Amir-Moezzi |date=2014 |ref=harv|doi = 10.1163/1573-3912_ei3_COM_27419}}</ref>\n\n''Mawla'' has a number of meanings in [[Arabic]], with interpretations of Muhammad's use here being split along sectarian lines between the Sunni and Shia. Among the former group, the word is translated as \"friend\" or \"one who is loyal/close\" and that Muhammad was advocating that Ali was deserving of friendship and respect.

While they were preparing his body, [[Abu Bakr]], [[Umar]], and [[Abu Ubaidah ibn al Jarrah]] met with the leaders of Medina and elected Abu Bakr as caliph. Ali did not accept the caliphate of [[Abu Bakr]] and refused to pledge allegiance to him. This is indicated in both [[Sunni]] and [[Shia]] ''sahih'' and authentic Hadith.\n\n[[File:Al-Kadhimiya Mosque, Kadhmain Shrine.jpg|300px|thumb|Left|[[Al-Kadhimiya Mosque]]]]\n[[Ibn Qutaybah]], a 9th-century [[Sunni]] Islamic scholar narrates of [[Ali]]:<blockquote>I am the servant of God and the brother of the Messenger of God. I am thus more worthy of this office than you. I shall not give allegiance to you [Abu Bakr & Umar] when it is more proper for you to give bay\u02bcah to me. You have seized this office from the Ansar using your tribal relationship to the Prophet as an argument against them. Would you then seize this office from us, the ahl al-bayt by force? Did you not claim before the Ansar that you were more worthy than they of the caliphate because Muhammad came from among you (but Muhammad was never from AbuBakr family) \u2013 and thus they gave you leadership and surrendered command? I now contend against you with the same argument\u2026It is we who are more worthy of the Messenger of God, living or dead. Give us our due right if you truly have faith in God, or else bear the charge of wilfully doing wrong... Umar, I will not yield to your commands: I shall not pledge loyalty to him.' Ultimately Abu Bakr said, \"O 'Ali! If you do not desire to give your bay'ah, I am not going to force you for the same.</blockquote>[[Ali]]'s wife, and daughter of [[Muhammad]], [[Fatimah]], refused to pledge allegiance to [[Abu Bakr]] and remained angry with him until she died due to the issues of [[Fadak]] and her inheritance from her father and the situation of [[Umar at Fatimah's house]]. This is stated in sahih Sunni Hadith, [[Sahih Bukhari]] and Sahih Muslim. [[Fatimah]] did not at all pledge allegiance or acknowledge or accept the caliphate of [[Abu Bakr]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://sunnah.com/search/?q=After+the+death+of+Allah+%27s+Apostle+Fatima+the+daughter+of+Allah%27s+Apostle+asked+Abu+Bakr+As-Siddiq+to+give+her,+her+share+of+inheritance+from+what+Allah%27s+Apostle+had+|title=After the death of Allah 's Apostle Fatima the daughter of Allah's Apostle asked Abu Bakr As-Siddiq to give her, her share of inheritance from what Allah's Apostle had (p. 1) \u2013 Sunnah.com \u2013 Sayings and Teachings of Prophet Muhammad (\u0635\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0647 \u0648 \u0633\u0644\u0645)|publisher=|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171010055547/https://sunnah.com/search/?q=After+the+death+of+Allah+%27s+Apostle+Fatima+the+daughter+of+Allah%27s+Apostle+asked+Abu+Bakr+As-Siddiq+to+give+her%2C+her+share+of+inheritance+from+what+Allah%27s+Apostle+had+|archivedate=10 October 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Almost all of [[Banu Hashim]], [[Muhammad]]'s clan and many of the ''sahaba'', had supported [[Ali]]'s cause after the demise of the prophet whilst others supported [[Abu Bakr]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.al-islam.org/history-shiism-advent-islam-end-minor-occultation-muharrami/lesson-8-shiah-among-companions-sahabah|title=Lesson 8: The Shi\u02bbah among the Companions {sahabah}|website=Al-Islam.org|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170729024723/https://www.al-islam.org/history-shiism-advent-islam-end-minor-occultation-muharrami/lesson-8-shiah-among-companions-sahabah|archivedate=29 July 2017|df=dmy-all|date=February 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.al-islam.org/house-sorrows-life-sayyidah-fatimah-al-zahra-and-her-grief-shaykh-abbas-qummi/chapter-3-state|title=Chapter 3: State of Affairs in Saqifah after the Death of the Prophet|website=Al-Islam.org|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170729151253/https://www.al-islam.org/house-sorrows-life-sayyidah-fatimah-al-zahra-and-her-grief-shaykh-abbas-qummi/chapter-3-state|archivedate=29 July 2017|df=dmy-all|date=21 April 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.islamicinsights.com/religion/clergy-corner/did-imam-ali-give-allegiance-to-abu-bakr.html|title=Did Imam Ali Give Allegiance to Abu Bakr?|publisher= Islamic Insights|date=8 December 2009|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170628084915/http://www.islamicinsights.com/religion/clergy-corner/did-imam-ali-give-allegiance-to-abu-bakr.html|archivedate=28 June 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>Riz\u0324v\u012b, Sayyid Sa'eed Ak\u0332h\u0332tar.

In 680 CE, Muawiyah died and passed the caliphate to his son [[Yazid I|Yazid]], and breaking the treaty with Hasan ibn Ali. Yazid asked Husayn to swear allegiance (''[[bay'ah]]'') to him. Ali's faction, having expected the caliphate to return to Ali's line upon Muawiyah's death, saw this as a betrayal of the peace treaty and so Husayn rejected this request for allegiance. There was a groundswell of support in Kufa for Husayn to return there and take his position as caliph and imam, so Husayn collected his family and followers in Medina and set off for Kufa. En route to Kufa, he was blocked by an army of Yazid's men (which included people from Kufa) near Karbala (modern Iraq), and Husayn and approximately 72 of his family and followers were killed in the [[Battle of Karbala]].\n\nThe Shia regard Husayn as a martyr (''[[shahid]]''), and count him as an Imam from the Ahl al-Bayt. They view Husayn as the defender of Islam from annihilation at the hands of [[Yazid I]].

For instance, the collection of hadith venerated by Shia Muslims is centered on narrations by members of the Ahl al-Bayt and their supporters, while some hadith by narrators not belonging to or supporting the Ahl al-Bayt are not included. Those of [[Abu Hurairah]], for example, Ibn Asakir in his Ta'rikh Kabir and Muttaqi in his Kanzu'l-Umma report that Caliph Umar lashed him, rebuked him and forbade him to narrate hadith from Muhammad. Umar said: \"Because you narrate hadith in large numbers from the Holy Prophet, you are fit only for attributing lies to him. (That is, one expects a wicked man like you to utter only lies about the Holy Prophet.) So you must stop narrating hadith from the Prophet; otherwise, I will send you to the land of Dus.\" (A clan in Yemen, to which Abu Huraira belonged.) According to Sunnis, Ali was the fourth successor to Abu Bakr, while the Shia maintain that Ali was the first divinely sanctioned \"Imam\", or successor of Muhammad. The seminal event in Shia history is the martyrdom in 680 CE at the [[Battle of Karbala]] of Ali's son [[Hussein ibn Ali]], who led a non-allegiance movement against the defiant caliph (71 of Hussein's followers were killed as well).\nIt is believed in Twelver and Ismaili Shia Islam that [['aql]], divine wisdom, was the source of the souls of the prophets and imams and gave them esoteric knowledge called ''\u1e25ikmah'' and that their sufferings were a means of divine grace to their devotees.<ref>Corbin 1993, pp. 45\u201351</ref><ref>Nasr (1979), p. 15</ref> Although the imam was not the recipient of a [[wahy|divine revelation]], he had a close relationship with God, through which God guides him, and the imam, in turn, guides the people.

This caused a number of changes in the Muslim world:\n* The ending of the relative mutual tolerance between Sunnis and Shias that existed from the time of the [[Mongol conquests]] onwards and the resurgence of antagonism between the two groups.\n* Initial dependence of Shiite clerics on the state followed by the emergence of an independent body of ''[[ulama]]'' capable of taking a political stand different from official policies.<ref>Francis Robinson, ''Atlas of the Muslim World'', p. 49.</ref>\n* The growth in importance of Iranian centers of religious learning and change from Twelver Shiism being a predominantly [[Arab people|Arab]] phenomenon.<ref>{{harvnb|Momen|1985|p=123}}</ref>\n* The growth of the [[Akhbari]] School which preached that only the [[Qur'an and Sunnah|Quran, hadith]] are to be bases for verdicts, rejecting the use of reasoning.\n\nWith the fall of the Safavids, the state in Persia\u2014including the state system of courts with government-appointed judges ([[qadi]]s)\u2014became much weaker. This gave the Sharia courts of ''[[mujtahid]]s'' an opportunity to fill the legal vacuum and enabled the ulama to assert their judicial authority.

The Sunni Shahada states ''There is no god except God, Muhammad is the messenger of God'', but to this the Shia append ''Ali is the [[Wali]] (custodian) of God'', {{lang|ar|\u0639\u0644\u064a \u0648\u0644\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647}}. This phrase embodies the Shia emphasis on the inheritance of authority through Muhammad's lineage. The three clauses of the Shia Shahada thus address ''[[tawhid]]'' (the unity of [[God]]), ''[[nubuwwah]]'' (the prophethood of Muhammad), and ''[[imamah]]'' (imamate, the leadership of the faith).\n\nThe basis of Ali as the \"wali\" is taken from a specific verse of the quran\n.<ref>quran 5:55</ref>  A more detailed discussion of this verse is available.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verse_of_Wilayah | title=Verse of Wilayah}}</ref>{{Circular reference|date=March 2019}}\n\n==Infallibility==\n[[File:Al\u012b.png|thumb|[[Ali]] is credited as the first male to convert to [[Islam]].]]\n{{main|Ismah}}\n''Ismah'' is the concept of [[infallibility]] or \"divinely bestowed freedom from error and sin\" in Islam.<ref>Dabashi, ''Theology of Discontent'', p. 463</ref> Muslims believe that Muhammad and other prophets in Islam possessed ''ismah''. Twelver and Ismaili Shia Muslims also attribute the quality to [[Imamah (Shia doctrine)|Imams]] as well as to [[Fatimah]], daughter of Muhammad, in contrast to the Zaidi, who do not attribute 'ismah to the Imams.<ref>Francis Robinson, ''Atlas of the Muslim World'', p. 47.</ref> Though initially beginning as a political movement, infallibility and sinlessness of the imams later evolved as a distinct belief of (non-Zaidi) Shiism.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Shii | title=Sh\u012b\u02bfite | work=Britannica | accessdate=21 July 2019}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Shia theologians, infallibility is considered a rational necessary precondition for spiritual and religious guidance. They argue that since God has commanded absolute obedience from these figures they must only order that which is right. The state of infallibility is based on the Shia interpretation of [[the verse of purification]].<ref>{{Cite quran|33|33|s=ns}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Momen|1985|p=155}}</ref> Thus, they are the most pure ones, the only immaculate ones preserved from, and immune to, all uncleanness.<ref>Corbin (1993), pp. 48 and 49</ref> It does not mean that supernatural powers prevent them from committing a sin, but due to the fact that they have absolute belief in God, they refrain from doing anything that is a sin.<ref name=\"Dabashi\">Dabashi (2006), [https://books.google.com/books?id=sTFdNNQP4ewC&pg=PA463 p. 463]</ref>\n\nThey also have a complete knowledge of God's will.

They thus act without fault in religious matters.<ref>Corbin (1993), p. 48</ref> Shias regard Ali as the successor of Muhammad not only ruling over [[Ummah|the community]] in justice, but also interpreting Islamic practices and its esoteric meaning.

The groups which do believe in it differ as to which lineage of the Imamate is valid, and therefore which individual has gone into occultation. They believe there are many signs that will indicate the time of his return.\n\nTwelver Shia Muslims believe that the Mahdi (the [[Twelve Imams|twelfth imam]], [[Muhammad al-Mahdi]]) is already on Earth, is in occultation and will return at the end of time.

The term ''Twelver'' is derived from the doctrine of believing in twelve divinely ordained leaders, known as [[The Twelve Imams]]. Twelver Shia are also known as ''Imami'' or ''Ja'fari'', originated from the name of the 6th Imam, Ja'far al-Sadiq, who elaborated the twelver jurisprudence.<ref>{{harvnb|Cornell|2007|p=237}}</ref>\n\nTwelvers constitute the majority of the population in [[Iran]] (90%),<ref>\"Esposito, John. \"What Everyone Needs to Know about Islam\" Oxford University Press, 2002. {{ISBN|978-0-19-515713-0}}. p. 45.</ref> Azerbaijan (85%),<ref name=\"Britannica738\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://files.preslib.az/projects/remz/pdf_en/atr_din.pdf|title=Administrative Department of the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan \u2013 Presidential Library \u2013 Religion|publisher=|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111123084541/http://files.preslib.az/projects/remz/pdf_en/atr_din.pdf|archivedate=23 November 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Bahrain (70%), Iraq (65%), Lebanon (65% of Muslims).<ref name=\"esp45\">Esposito, John. \"What Everyone Needs to Know about Islam\" Oxford University Press, 2002. {{ISBN|978-0-19-515713-0}}. p. 45</ref><ref name=\"glob\">{{cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/gulf/bahrain-religion.htm|title=Bahrain \u2013 Religion|author=John Pike|work=globalsecurity.org|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118214401/http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/gulf/bahrain-religion.htm|archivedate=18 January 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name=review>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurasiareview.com/25032011-challenges-for-saudi-arabia-amidst-protests-in-the-gulf-analysis/|title=Challenges For Saudi Arabia Amidst Protests In The Gulf \u2013 Analysis|work=Eurasia Review|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401034318/http://www.eurasiareview.com/25032011-challenges-for-saudi-arabia-amidst-protests-in-the-gulf-analysis/|archivedate=1 April 2012|df=dmy-all|date=25 March 2011}}</ref>\n\n====Doctrine====\n[[File:Names of imameen.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Names of all 12 Imams (descendants of Imam Ali) written in the form of [[Language|Arabic]] name '''\u0639\u0644\u0649 ''' 'Ali']]\nTwelver doctrine is based on [[Theology of Twelvers|five principles]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/shiite-doctrine|title=Shi\u02bfite Doctrine|work=iranicaonline.org|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150517022711/http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/shiite-doctrine|archivedate=17 May 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref> These five principles known as ''Usul ad-Din'' are as follow:<ref>Joanne Richter, (2006), [https://books.google.com/books?id=X9fxXEdeIP8C&pg=PA7 ''Iran the Culture''], p. 7</ref><ref>Mulla Bashir Rahim, ''[http://www.al-islam.org/begin/intro/rahim.html An Introduction to Islam] {{webarchive|url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20091014001501/http://www.al-islam.org/begin/intro/rahim.html |date=14 October 2009 }}'', by [[Ahlul Bayt Digital Islamic Library Project]]</ref>\n# '''[[Tawhid|Monotheism]]''', God is one and unique.\n# '''[[Adl|Justice]]''', the concept of moral rightness based on ethics, fairness, and equity, along with the punishment of the breach of these ethics.\n# '''[[Nubuwwah|Prophethood]]''', the institution by which God sends emissaries, or prophets, to guide mankind.\n# '''[[Imamate|Leadership]]''', a divine institution which succeeded the institution of Prophethood. Its appointees (imams) are divinely appointed.\n# '''Last Judgment''', God's final assessment of humanity.\n\nMore specifically, these principles are known as Usul al-Madhhab (principles of the Shia sect) according to Twelver Shias which differ from Daruriyat al-Din (Necessities of Religion) which are principles in order for one to be a Muslim. The Necessities of Religion do not include Leadership (Imamah) as it is not a requirement in order for one to be recognized as a Muslim. However, this category, according to Twelver scholars like Ayatollah al-Khoei, does include belief in God, Prophethood, the Day of Resurrection and other \"necessities\" (like belief in angels). In this regard, Twelver Shias draw a distinction in terms of believing in the main principles of Islam on the one hand, and specifically Shia doctrines like Imamah on the other.\n\n====Books====\nBesides the Quran which is common to all Muslims, the Shia derive guidance from books of traditions (\"\u1e25ad\u012bth\") attributed to Muhammad and the Twelve Imams. Below is a list of some of the most prominent of these books:\n* [[Nahj al-Balagha]] by [[Ali ibn Abi Talib]] \u2013 the most famous collection of sermons, letters & narration by the first Imam regarded by Shias\n* [[al-Kafi]] by [[Muhammad ibn Ya'qub al-Kulayni]]<ref>{{cite book|last=Islamic Texts Institute|title=Al-Kafi Book I: Intellect and Foolishness|year=2012|publisher=Taqwa Media|isbn=978-1-939420-00-8}}</ref>\n* Wasa'il al-Shi\u02bbah by al-Hurr al-Amili\n\n====The Twelve Imams====\n{{see also|The Twelve Imams|Hadith of the Twelve Successors|l2=Sunni reports about there being 12 successors to the Prophet}}\nThe ''Twelve Imams'' are the spiritual and political successors to Muhammad for the Twelvers.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} According to the theology of Twelvers, the successor of Muhammad is an [[Ismah|infallible]] human individual who not only rules over the community with justice but also is able to keep and interpret the divine law and its esoteric meaning. The words and deeds of Muhammad and the imams are a guide and model for the community to follow; as a result, they must be free from error and sin, and Imams must be chosen by divine decree, or ''nass'', through Muhammad.<ref name=\"Nasr_a\" /><ref name=\"Momen 1985, p. 174\"/> Each imam was the son of the previous imam, with the exception of [[Husayn ibn Ali|Hussein ibn Ali]], who was the brother of Hasan ibn Ali.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} The twelfth and final imam is Muhammad al-Mahdi, who is believed by the Twelvers to be currently alive and in occultation.<ref name=\"Imamat\"/>\n\n====Jurisprudence====\n{{main|Ja'fari jurisprudence}}\n{{see also|Shia clergy}}\nThe Twelver jurisprudence is called ''Ja'fari jurisprudence''. In this [[jurisprudence]] ''Sunnah'' is considered to be the oral traditions of Muhammad and their implementation and interpretation by the twelve Imams. There are three schools of Ja'fari jurisprudence: Usuli, Akhbari, and [[Shaykhism|Shaykhi]]. The Usuli school is by far the largest of the three. Twelver groups that do not follow Ja'fari jurisprudence include [[Alevi]], [[Bektashi Order|Bektashi]], and [[Qizilbash]].\n\nThe five primary pillars of Islam to the Ja'fari jurisprudence, known as ''Usul' ad-Din''. They are at variance with the standard Sunni \"five pillars of religion.\"  The Shia's primary \"pillars\" are:\n\n# ''[[Tawhid]]'' or oneness of God.\n# ''[[Nabuwa]]'' prophethood of Muhammad.\n# ''[[Mu'ad]]'' resurrection.\n# ''[[Adl]]''  justice (of God)\n# ''[[Imama]]''  the rightful place of the Shia Imams\n\nIn Ja'fari jurisprudence, there are eight secondary pillars, known as ''Furu' ad-Din'', which are as follows:<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=X9fxXEdeIP8C&pg=PA7 ''Iran the Culture''] Joanne Richter (2007), p. 7</ref>\n# ''[[salat|Prayer]]''\n# ''[[Sawm|Fasting]]''\n# ''[[Hajj|Pilgrimage]]'' to [[Mecca]]\n# ''[[Zak\u0101t|Alms giving]]''\n# ''[[Jihad|Struggle]]'' for the righteous cause\n# ''[[Ma'ruf|Directing others towards good]]''\n# ''[[Forbidding what is evil|Directing others away from evil]]''\n# ''[[Khums]])'' (20% tax on savings yearly, {after deduction of commercial expenses.})\n\nAccording to Twelvers, defining and interpretation of Islamic jurisprudence is the responsibility of Muhammad and the twelve Imams. As the 12th Imam is in occultation, it is the duty of clerics to refer to the Islamic literature such as the Quran and hadith and identify legal decisions within the confines of Islamic law to provide means to deal with current issues from an Islamic perspective. In other words, Twelver clerics provide Guardianship of the Islamic Jurisprudence, which was defined by Muhammad and his twelve successors. This process is known as ''Ijtihad'' and the clerics are known as ''[[Marja'|Marja]]''', meaning reference.

Followers of the Zaidi [[fiqh]] are called Zaidis (or occasionally '''Fivers'''). However, there is also a group called ''Zaidi Was\u012bt\u012bs'' who are Twelvers (see below).

Zaidis also do not believe that the Imamate must pass from father to son but believe it can be held by any [[Sayyid]] descended from either Hasan ibn Ali or Hussein ibn Ali (as was the case after the death of Hasan ibn Ali). Historically, Zaidis held that Zayd was the rightful successor of the 4th imam since he led a rebellion against the Umayyads in protest of their tyranny and corruption. Muhammad al-Baqir did not engage in political action, and the followers of Zayd believed that a true imam must fight against corrupt rulers.\n\n====Jurisprudence====\nIn matters of [[Fiqh|Islamic jurisprudence]], the Zaydis follow Zayd ibn Ali's teachings which are documented in his book ''Majmu'l Fiqh'' (in [[Arabic language|Arabic]]: {{big|\u0645\u062c\u0645\u0648\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0650\u0642\u0647}}).

With the eventual development of Twelverism into the more literalistic ''([[Zahir (Islam)|zahir]])'' oriented Akhbari and later Usuli schools of thought, Shiaism developed in two separate directions: the metaphorical Ismailli group focusing on the [[mysticism|mystical]] path and nature of God and the divine manifestation in the personage of the \"Imam of the Time\" as the \"Face of God\", with the more literalistic Twelver group focusing on divine law (''shar\u012b'ah'') and the deeds and sayings (''sunnah'') of Muhammad and his successors (the ''Ahlu l-Bayt''), who as A'immah were guides and a light to God.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www-personal.umich.edu/~jrcole/ahsai1.htm | title = Shaykh Ahmad al-Ahsa'i | accessdate = 25 April 2007 | url-status=live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070218072512/http://www-personal.umich.edu/~jrcole/ahsai1.htm | archivedate = 18 February 2007 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThough there are several sub-groupings within the Ismailis, the term in today's vernacular generally refers to the Shia Imami Ismaili Muslim ([[Nizari]] community), generally known as the Ismailis, who are followers of the [[Aga Khan]] and the largest group among the Ismailiyyah.

During this period, three lineages of imams formed. The first branch, known today as the [[Druze]], began with [[Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah]]. Born in 386 AH (985), he ascended as ruler at the age of eleven. The typical religiously tolerant Fatimid Empire saw much persecution under his reign. When in 411 AH (1021) his mule returned without him, soaked in blood, a religious group that was forming in his lifetime broke off from mainstream Ismailism and did not acknowledge his successor.

Upon his passing away, his sons, [[Nizar (Fatimid Imam)|Nizar]] the older, and [[Al-Musta'li]], the younger, fought for political and spiritual control of the dynasty.

The Imam of the Age defines the jurisprudence, and his guidance may differ with Imams previous to him because of different times and circumstances. For Nizari Ismailis, the Imam is Karim al-Husayni [[Aga Khan IV]]. The Nizari line of Imams has continued to this day as an unending line.\n\nDivine leadership has continued in the Bohra branch through the institution of the \"Unrestricted Missionary\" [[List of Dai of Dawoodi Bohra|Dai]]. According to Bohra tradition, before the last Imam, At-Tayyib Abi l-Qasim, went into seclusion, his father, the 20th Al-Amir bi-Ahkami l-Lah, had instructed [[Al-Hurra Al-Malika]] the [[Malik]]a ([[Queen consort]]) in Yemen to appoint a vicegerent after the seclusion\u2014the ''Unrestricted Missionary'', who as the Imam's vicegerent has full authority to govern the community in all matters both spiritual and temporal while the lineage of Mustaali-Tayyibi Imams remains in seclusion (Dawr-e-Satr). The three branches of the Mustaali, the [[Alavi Bohra]], [[Sulaymani|Sulaimani Bohra]] and [[Dawoodi Bohra]], differ on who the current Unrestricted Missionary is.\n\n==Other doctrines==\n\n===Doctrine about necessity of acquiring knowledge===\nAccording to Allameh [[Muhammad Rida al-Muzaffar|Muzaffar]] God gives humans the faculty of reason and argument. Also, God orders humans to spend time thinking carefully on creation while he refers to all creations as his signs of power and glory. These signs encompass all of the universe. Furthermore, there is a similarity between humans as the little world and the universe as the large world. God does not accept the faith of those who follow him without thinking and only with imitation, but also God blames them for such actions.\nIn other words, humans have to think about the universe with reason and intellect, a faculty bestowed on us by God.  Since there is more insistence on the faculty of intellect among Shia, even evaluating the claims of someone who claims prophecy is on the basis of intellect.<ref>{{cite book|author=Allamah Muhammad Rida Al Muzaffar|title=The faith of Shia Islam|year=1989|page=1|publisher=Ansariyan Qum}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.introducingislam.org/info/muzaffar/chapter1.php|title=The Beliefs of Shia Islam \u2013 Chapter 1|publisher=|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161025175646/http://www.introducingislam.org/info/muzaffar/chapter1.php|archivedate=25 October 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Doctrine concerning Du'a===\n\nPraying or Du\u02bca in Shia has an important place as Muhammad described it as a weapon of the believer. In fact, Du\u02bca considered as something that is a feature of Shia community in a sense. Performing Du\u02bca in Shia has a special ritual. Because of this, there are many books written on the conditions of praying among Shia.

Originally set in Alaska, once green-lit the script was altered and filming moved to Mississippi over financial concerns. The budget was less than $1 million, with $15,000 of it raised via the crowdfunding website [[Indiegogo]]. Lundgren was cast around 9\u201310 months before filming commenced, whilst Klebe only had one-to-two weeks notice.\n\nAfter being postponed twice, principal photography commenced over the 2015 Christmas holiday season in [[Lexington, Mississippi]].

Opening to mostly positive reviews, Noel Murray of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', described ''Don't Kill It'' as one of Lundgren's \"most entertaining movies in years.\"\n\n==Plot==\nWhile chasing deer on a hunting trip in southern Mississippi, Gabriel's dog discovers and opens a small, unusual golden container. When Gabriel finds his dog, it acts strangely before violently attacking him. After shooting and killing the dog in self-defense, Gabriel returns home, displaying the same unusual behaviors and black eyes. In the wake of killing his family, Gabriel enters a neighboring house and begins to slaughter everyone in sight before being shot dead by his neighbor, Marcus, who immediately gets the same black eyes and completes Gabriel's task; by murdering his own family.\n\nA few days later, demon hunter Jebediah Woodley hears of the murders on the radio and travels to the small town to investigate. At the same time, FBI agent Evelyn Pierce, who grew up in the area, has been assigned to investigate the case for possible links to domestic terrorism. Woodley travels to the local police station to express his concerns. However, Pierce - along with Dunham, the local police chief - quickly dismiss Woodley's claims of demon activity and order him to be detained under the assumption that he is mentally ill. Whilst Pierce leaves to interview a witness to the most recent series of murders, Woodley advises her to ask about the killer's eyes. Upon interviewing the witness, it is explained to Pierce that Gabriel entered the witness' home and killed her daughter before being shot by her husband, Marcus. Marcus then executed their son and attempted to murder her before she escaped. Pierce learns that that the husband's eyes also turned black before he went into a murderous rampage; thus realizing Woodley is in fact telling the truth.\n\nBack at the station, Woodley is released by Pierce and Dunham. At a nearby caf\u00e9, Woodley explains to them that the demon possesses the body of whoever killed its last host. He goes on to say: the only way to defeat the demon is by killing the host whilst simultaneously ensuring your own death; his own father captured the demon when he was a child and poisoned himself before killing the host. Woodley held onto the captured demon for decades before it escaped.\n\nAfter stocking up on weapons and ammunition, Woodley and Pierce's investigation takes them to a nearby cabin in the woods. Woodley and Pierce mistakenly capture a drunkard living in the cabin, who says he shot the demon in the stomach and that it was his friend, Glen, that executed the demon's host; and ran off into the woods immediately following the incident. Woodley and Pierce proceed to track the demon through the woods, which ends with Pierce being attacked by the demon. Instead of killing her, the demon shows an interest in Pierce and attempts to get her to kill it, giving her horrible visions of an apocalyptic future. Woodley tries to subdue the demon, but before he can do so, it manages to escape. Later, Pierce visits her old home with Woodley and tells him that she drowned to death in her garden pool as a child, but was mysteriously brought back to life. This resulted in her family being persecuted and run out of town by superstitious citizens.\n\nDunham organizes a town hall meeting, late at night, to warn citizens of the danger. During his speech, Dunham is interrupted by the demon, who slaughters the congregation and rapidly changes bodies before Woodley can get to it. It flees to a nearby house, where it manipulates a young girl into killing its host; thus taking over the girl. Dunham flees the town; at the same time Woodley enters a church, where the local pastor, Erikson, who remains suspicious of him, accuses Woodley and Pierce of being evil and the cause of mayhem. Woodley reacts by punching Erikson, and leaves to rejoin Pierce.\n\nThe father of the now-possessed girl, Emmett, encounters Woodley and Pierce in the middle of the anarchy; urging both to help him. Woodley and Pierce travel to Emmett's home, where it is revealed Emmett has locked his daughter in a backroom. Woodley convinces Emmett to poison himself and kill his daughter, ending the demon's trail as before. However, the FBI - who have been called there secretly by Pierce - storm the home before Emmett can carry out the killing, and Emmett dies uselessly; the head agent, Deacon Shepherd, has Woodley arrested for poisoning him. The possessed girl slaughters the FBI agents except for Shepherd, who mortally wounds the demon before it flees.\n\nFleeing farther into the woods, the demon's host eventually dies and it possesses Shepherd; given he mortally wounded the demon minutes prior. The demon once more goads Pierce into killing it. Woodley risks his own life to successfully capture the demon and prepares to poison himself in an effort to kill the demon, like his father before him. Before completing the ritual, Woodley and Pierce are interrupted by Erikson, who has tracked them down with an angry mob of congregation members; under the assumption Woodley is evil and has captured an innocent man. Erikson attacks Woodley as the mob frees Shepherd, who immediately begins to murder everyone present. Erikson kills Shepherd and is possessed. As the demon tries to kill Woodley, Pierce grabs a vest covered in grenades from a dead FBI agent's corpse and pulls the pin out before killing Erikson. As the demon takes over Pierce, an apocalyptic phenomena from Pierce's earlier visions begins to occur. Whilst possessed Pierce levitates off the ground, but the grenade in her hand detonates, killing both her and the demon.\n\nSome time later, Woodley is seen on a boat in the middle of the ocean. Having captured the remains of the demon in a flask, Woodley drops the flask into the ocean. The flask is quickly consumed by a [[great white shark]], implying the events will repeat in the near future.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Dolph Lundgren]] as Jebediah Woodley\n** Ryan Zweers as Young Jebediah\n* [[Kristina Klebe]] as Agent Evelyn Pierce\n* Tony Bentley as Chief Dunham\n* James Chalke as Pastor Erikson\n* [[Miles Doleac]] as Deacon Shepard\n* Otis Willard as Toby Bronson\n* Michelle West as Amber\n* [[Todd Farmer]] as Marcus\n* Dawn Ferry as Wendy\n* Thomas Owen as Jeremy\n* [[Billy Slaughter]] as Agent Jackson\n* Aaron McPherson as Emmett\n* Joh Bohn as Agent Lug\n* Jasi Lanier as Rose\n* Michael Aaron Milligan as Frank\n* Laura Warner as Eunice\n* Randy Austin as Gabriel\n* Milorad Djomlija as Glen Prichard\n* Sam Furman as Danny\n* Tony Messenger as Jebediah Woodley Sr.\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nMike Mendez was attached to direct the film for over four years,{{refn|group=N|Mendez contradicted himself in an interview, so the exact length of attachment is not known.<ref name=SLWilson>Wilson, Staci Layne.

Originally set in Alaska, once green-lit the script was altered and filming moved to Mississippi over financial concerns. The budget was less than $1 million, with $15,000 of it raised via the crowdfunding website [[Indiegogo]]. Lundgren was cast around 9\u201310 months before filming commenced, whilst Klebe only had one-to-two weeks notice.\n\nAfter being postponed twice, principal photography commenced over the 2015 Christmas holiday season in [[Lexington, Mississippi]]. Filming concluded after 17 days of shooting, with the film having its premiere at the Fantasy Filmfest in [[Hamburg, Germany]], on August 27, 2016. This was followed by the North American premiere on September 26, 2016, at [[Fantastic Fest]] in [[Austin, Texas]]. A limited theatrical release followed on March 3, 2017, via [[AMC Theatres]]. Opening to mostly positive reviews, Noel Murray of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', described ''Don't Kill It'' as one of Lundgren's \"most entertaining movies in years.\"\n\n==Plot==\nWhile chasing deer on a hunting trip in southern Mississippi, Gabriel's dog discovers and opens a small, unusual golden container. When Gabriel finds his dog, it acts strangely before violently attacking him. After shooting and killing the dog in self-defense, Gabriel returns home, displaying the same unusual behaviors and black eyes. In the wake of killing his family, Gabriel enters a neighboring house and begins to slaughter everyone in sight before being shot dead by his neighbor, Marcus, who immediately gets the same black eyes and completes Gabriel's task; by murdering his own family.\n\nA few days later, demon hunter Jebediah Woodley hears of the murders on the radio and travels to the small town to investigate. At the same time, FBI agent Evelyn Pierce, who grew up in the area, has been assigned to investigate the case for possible links to domestic terrorism. Woodley travels to the local police station to express his concerns. However, Pierce - along with Dunham, the local police chief - quickly dismiss Woodley's claims of demon activity and order him to be detained under the assumption that he is mentally ill. Whilst Pierce leaves to interview a witness to the most recent series of murders, Woodley advises her to ask about the killer's eyes. Upon interviewing the witness, it is explained to Pierce that Gabriel entered the witness' home and killed her daughter before being shot by her husband, Marcus. Marcus then executed their son and attempted to murder her before she escaped. Pierce learns that that the husband's eyes also turned black before he went into a murderous rampage; thus realizing Woodley is in fact telling the truth.\n\nBack at the station, Woodley is released by Pierce and Dunham. At a nearby caf\u00e9, Woodley explains to them that the demon possesses the body of whoever killed its last host. He goes on to say: the only way to defeat the demon is by killing the host whilst simultaneously ensuring your own death; his own father captured the demon when he was a child and poisoned himself before killing the host. Woodley held onto the captured demon for decades before it escaped.\n\nAfter stocking up on weapons and ammunition, Woodley and Pierce's investigation takes them to a nearby cabin in the woods. Woodley and Pierce mistakenly capture a drunkard living in the cabin, who says he shot the demon in the stomach and that it was his friend, Glen, that executed the demon's host; and ran off into the woods immediately following the incident. Woodley and Pierce proceed to track the demon through the woods, which ends with Pierce being attacked by the demon. Instead of killing her, the demon shows an interest in Pierce and attempts to get her to kill it, giving her horrible visions of an apocalyptic future. Woodley tries to subdue the demon, but before he can do so, it manages to escape. Later, Pierce visits her old home with Woodley and tells him that she drowned to death in her garden pool as a child, but was mysteriously brought back to life. This resulted in her family being persecuted and run out of town by superstitious citizens.\n\nDunham organizes a town hall meeting, late at night, to warn citizens of the danger. During his speech, Dunham is interrupted by the demon, who slaughters the congregation and rapidly changes bodies before Woodley can get to it. It flees to a nearby house, where it manipulates a young girl into killing its host; thus taking over the girl. Dunham flees the town; at the same time Woodley enters a church, where the local pastor, Erikson, who remains suspicious of him, accuses Woodley and Pierce of being evil and the cause of mayhem. Woodley reacts by punching Erikson, and leaves to rejoin Pierce.\n\nThe father of the now-possessed girl, Emmett, encounters Woodley and Pierce in the middle of the anarchy; urging both to help him. Woodley and Pierce travel to Emmett's home, where it is revealed Emmett has locked his daughter in a backroom. Woodley convinces Emmett to poison himself and kill his daughter, ending the demon's trail as before. However, the FBI - who have been called there secretly by Pierce - storm the home before Emmett can carry out the killing, and Emmett dies uselessly; the head agent, Deacon Shepherd, has Woodley arrested for poisoning him. The possessed girl slaughters the FBI agents except for Shepherd, who mortally wounds the demon before it flees.\n\nFleeing farther into the woods, the demon's host eventually dies and it possesses Shepherd; given he mortally wounded the demon minutes prior. The demon once more goads Pierce into killing it. Woodley risks his own life to successfully capture the demon and prepares to poison himself in an effort to kill the demon, like his father before him. Before completing the ritual, Woodley and Pierce are interrupted by Erikson, who has tracked them down with an angry mob of congregation members; under the assumption Woodley is evil and has captured an innocent man. Erikson attacks Woodley as the mob frees Shepherd, who immediately begins to murder everyone present. Erikson kills Shepherd and is possessed. As the demon tries to kill Woodley, Pierce grabs a vest covered in grenades from a dead FBI agent's corpse and pulls the pin out before killing Erikson. As the demon takes over Pierce, an apocalyptic phenomena from Pierce's earlier visions begins to occur. Whilst possessed Pierce levitates off the ground, but the grenade in her hand detonates, killing both her and the demon.\n\nSome time later, Woodley is seen on a boat in the middle of the ocean. Having captured the remains of the demon in a flask, Woodley drops the flask into the ocean. The flask is quickly consumed by a [[great white shark]], implying the events will repeat in the near future.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Dolph Lundgren]] as Jebediah Woodley\n** Ryan Zweers as Young Jebediah\n* [[Kristina Klebe]] as Agent Evelyn Pierce\n* Tony Bentley as Chief Dunham\n* James Chalke as Pastor Erikson\n* [[Miles Doleac]] as Deacon Shepard\n* Otis Willard as Toby Bronson\n* Michelle West as Amber\n* [[Todd Farmer]] as Marcus\n* Dawn Ferry as Wendy\n* Thomas Owen as Jeremy\n* [[Billy Slaughter]] as Agent Jackson\n* Aaron McPherson as Emmett\n* Joh Bohn as Agent Lug\n* Jasi Lanier as Rose\n* Michael Aaron Milligan as Frank\n* Laura Warner as Eunice\n* Randy Austin as Gabriel\n* Milorad Djomlija as Glen Prichard\n* Sam Furman as Danny\n* Tony Messenger as Jebediah Woodley Sr.\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nMike Mendez was attached to direct the film for over four years,{{refn|group=N|Mendez contradicted himself in an interview, so the exact length of attachment is not known.<ref name=SLWilson>Wilson, Staci Layne.

What is today known as [[Lower Austria]] corresponds to the ''Marcha Orientalis'', while [[Upper Austria]] corresponds to the eastern half of the core territory of Bavaria (the western half forming part of the [[States of Germany|German state]] of [[Bavaria]]).\n\nThe adjective ''Austrian'' entered the English language in the early 17th century, at the time referring to [[Archduchy of Austria|Habsburg Austria]] in the sense of \"members of the Austrian branch of the [[House of Habsburg]]\" (the junior branch emerging from the dynastic split into Austrian and Spanish Habsburgs in 1521), but from the 18th century also \"a native or inhabitant of Austria\".<ref>[[OED]] s.g. \"Austrian, ''adj.'' and ''n.''\"</ref>\n\n== History ==\n\n===Early history===\n[[File:Hallstatt LaTene.png|thumb|300px|Overview of the [[Hallstatt culture|Hallstatt]] and [[La T\u00e8ne culture|La T\u00e8ne]] cultures:\n{{legend|#f6bc0a|The core Hallstatt territory (HaC, 800 BC) is shown in solid yellow, }}\nThe territories of some major [[List of Celtic tribes|Celtic tribes]] of the late La T\u00e8ne period are labelled.]]\nThe territory of what is today Austria in the [[Roman Empire|Roman era]] was divided into [[Raetia]], [[Noricum]] and [[Pannonia]].\nNoricum was a [[Celt]]ic kingdom, while the ''[[Pannonians|Pannonii]]'' were of [[Illyrians|Illyrian]] stock. The [[Raetians]] were an ancient [[history of the Alps|alpine]] people probably akin to the [[Etruscans]]. During the [[Migration period]] (c. 6th century), these territories were settled by the [[Bavarians]] and other [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] groups in the west ([[Alemanni]] in [[Vorarlberg]], [[Lombards]] in [[Tyrol (region)|Tyrol]]), and by [[Slavic settlement of the Eastern Alps|Slavic]] groups, [[Huns]] and [[Avars (Carpathians)|Avars]] in the east. In the 8th century, the former territories of Raetia and Noricum fell under [[Carolingian Empire|Carolingian rule]], and were divided into the duchies of [[Swabia]], [[Bavaria]] and [[Duchy of Carinthia|Carinthia]]. Pannonia until the end of the 8th century was part of the [[Avar Khaganate]]. The \"[[Margraviate of Austria|East March]]\" (''Ostmark'') during the 9th century was the boundary region separating [[East Francia]] from the Avars and the [[Magyars]]. The site of [[Vienna]] had been settled since Celtic times (as ''[[Vindobona]]''), but the city only rose to importance in the [[High Middle Ages]] as the chief settlement of the March of Austria (the [[Morava (river)|March river]] just east of Vienna marks the ancient border between Francia and the Avars).\n\nAfter the defeat of the Magyars at the [[Battle of Lechfeld]] in 955, the East March or [[March of Austria]] came to be the easternmost portion of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], bordering on [[Moravia]] to the north and on the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] to the east.\nAs a consequence, the national character of the [[Austro-Bavarian]] speaking majority population of Austria throughout their early modern and modern history remained characterized by their neighbourhood to the [[West Slavs]] ([[Czechs]], [[Slovaks]]) to the north, the [[South Slavs]] ([[Slovenians]], [[Carinthian Slovenes]], [[Burgenland Croats]]) to the south, and the [[Hungarians]] to the east.\n\nThe unification of the various territories of Austria outside of the March of Austria proper\n(i.e. parts of Bavaria, Swabia and Carinthia) was a gradual process of [[feudalism|feudal politics]] during the High and Late Middle Ages, at first in the [[Archduchy of Austria]] under the [[House of Babenberg]] during the 12th to 13th centuries, and under the [[House of Habsburg]] after 1278 and throughout the 14th and 15th centuries. The various populations of these territories were not unified under the single name of \"Austrians\" before the [[early modern period]].\n\n===Early Modern period===\n{{Further|Habsburg Austria}}\n[[File:Growth of Habsburg territories.jpg|thumb|300px|Growth of the Habsburg Monarchy]]\nThe [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]], who had ruled the territory of Austria since the [[Late Middle Ages]], greatly increased their political prestige and power with the acquisition of the lands of the crowns of [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]] and [[Bohemia]] in 1526. The Hungarian aristocracy was more successful at retaining the [[Magyars]]' cultural and political preponderance in multi-ethnic Hungary than Bohemia, on three sides surrounded by German neighbours, which underwent a period of intense German colonisation, [[Germanization|germanizing]] the leading classes of the [[Czechs|Czech]] people as well. The common German identity of lands such as Carinthia, Styria, or Tyrol, and the ruling dynasty made it easier for these lands to accept the central government set up in Vienna in the mid-18th century.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nThe term Austrian in these times was used for identifying subjects of the Domus Austriae, the House of Austria, as the dynasty was called in Europe, regardless of their ethnic ancestry. Although not formally a united state, the lands ruled by the Habsburgs would sometimes be known by the name \"Austria\". In reality they remained a disparate range of semi-autonomous states, most of which were part of the complex network of states that was the [[Holy Roman Empire]] (the imperial institutions of which were themselves controlled for much of their later existence by the Habsburgs). However, the second half of the 18th century saw an increasingly centralised state begin to develop under the reign of [[Maria Theresa of Austria]] and her son [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]].\n\nAfter the [[French Revolution]] and the rise of [[Napoleon]], the emperor [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Franz II]] formally founded the [[Austrian Empire]] in 1804 and became as ''Franz I'' the first Austrian emperor. For the first time the citizens of the various territories were now subjects of the one same state, while most of the German states, [[Prussia]] excluded, still cultivated their [[Kleinstaaterei]] and didn't succeed in forming a homogenous empire. Following Prussia's victory in the [[Austro-Prussian war]] in 1866, [[Otto von Bismarck]] successfully unified the [[German Empire]] in 1871, which was Prussian-dominated, without the inclusion of Austria and the German Austrians.<ref>Mark Allinson, Germany and Austria 1814-2000, pp. 23-29</ref>\n\nAfter Austria was excluded from Germany in 1866, the following year Austria joined Hungary as a dual empire known as the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]]. A further major change resulted from a reorganisation of the Austrian Empire in 1867 into a [[dual monarchy]], acknowledging the Kingdom of Hungary as an independent state bound to the remaining part of the empire, as well independent, by a personal and real union, the Emperor of Austria being the Apostolic King of Hungary (with both titles on the same level). The Austrian half, a patchwork of crown-lands, broadly coterminous with the modern-day Austria, the [[Czech Republic]], [[Slovenia]], and parts of [[Poland]], [[Ukraine]], [[Italy]], and [[Croatia]], was bound together by the common constitution of 1867, stating that all subjects now would carry \"uniform Austrian citizenship\" and have the same fundamental rights. These non-Hungarian lands were not officially called the Austrian Empire. Until 1915, they were officially called \"the Kingdoms and States Represented in the Imperial Council\" and politicians used the technical term [[Cisleithania]] (labelling the Hungarian lands as [[Transleithania]]). The general public called them Austria, and in 1915, the non-parliamentary Cisleithanian government decreed to use this term officially, too.\n\n===19th-century nationalism===\n{{main|Austrian nationalism|Austria\u2013Prussia rivalry|German nationalism|German nationalism in Austria|Pan-Germanism}}\n[[File:Map-GermanConfederation.svg|thumb|240px|left|[[Central Europe]] (ca 1820) showing the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] (blue), the [[Austrian Empire]] (yellow) and other independent German states (grey). The red line marks the border of the German Confederation; both Prussia and Austria controlled lands outside the Confederation.]]\n\nThe idea of grouping all [[Germans]] into one nation-state gave way to a rapid rise of German nationalism within the [[German Confederation]], especially in the two most powerful German states, Austria and Prussia. The question of how a unified Germany was to be formed was a matter of debate. The [[German Question]] was to be solved by either unifying all German-speaking peoples under one state as the \"Greater German solution\" (''Gro\u00dfdeutsche L\u00f6sung''), which was promoted by the Austrian Empire and its supporters. On the other hand, the \"Lesser German solution\" (''Kleindeutsche L\u00f6sung'') advocated only to unify the northern German states and exclude Austria; this proposal was favored by the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] and its supporters. This debate became known as [[German dualism]].\n\nThe lands later called Cisleithania (except [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]] and [[Dalmatia]]) were members of the German Confederation since 1815 as they had been part of the Holy Roman Empire until 1806. Until 1848, Austria and its chancellor Prince [[Metternich]] unanimously dominated the confederation. The developing sense of a German nationality had been accelerated massively as a consequence of the political turmoil and wars that engulfed [[Central Europe]] following the [[French Revolution]] and the rise to power of [[Napoleon Bonaparte]]. Although the years of peace after Napoleon's fall quickly saw German nationalism largely pushed out of the public political arena by reactionary absolutism, the [[Revolutions of 1848]] established it as a significant political issue for a period of nearly hundred years.\n[[File:Deutscher Bund.svg|thumb|240px|A map of the German Confederation in 1849 showing the 39 independent states.]]\nPolitical debate now centred on the nature of a possible future German state to replace the Confederation, and part of that debate concerned the issue of whether or not the Austrian lands had a place in the German polity. When Emperor Franz Joseph I ordered to build a monument in Vienna in 1860 to [[Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen|Archduke Charles]], victor over Napoleon in the [[Battle of Aspern-Essling]] in 1809, it carried the dedication \"To the persistent fighter for Germany's honour\", to underline the Germanic mission of the House of Austria.\n\nThe idea of uniting all ethnic Germans into one nation-state began to be challenged in Austria by the rise of [[Austrian nationalism]], especially within the [[Christian Social Party (Austria)|Christian Social Party]] that identified Austrians on the basis of their predominantly Catholic religious identity as opposed to the predominantly Protestant religious identity of the Prussians.<ref>Spohn, Willfried (2005), \"Austria: From Habsburg Empire to a Small Nation in Europe\", Entangled identities: nations and Europe, Ashgate, p. 61</ref>\n\nHabsburg influence over the German Confederation, which was strongest in the southern member states, was rivalled by the increasingly powerful [[Prussia]]n state. Political manoeuvering by the Prussian [[chancellor]] [[Otto von Bismarck]] resulted in military defeat of the Austrians in the Austro-Prussian War of 1866 and the collapse of the Confederation, both effectively ending any future Austrian influence on German\npolitical events.\n\nWhen asked by Edward VII to abandon Austria-Hungary's alliance with Germany for co-operation with England, Franz Joseph replied \"I am a German prince.\"<ref>(\"Ich bin ein Deutscher F\u00fcrst\") Walter Wiltschegg: \u00d6sterreich, der \"zweite deutsche Staat\"?: der nationale Gedanke in der Ersten Republik, Stocker, 1992, p. 41 (German)</ref><ref>Richard Bassett, For God and Kaiser: The Imperial Austrian Army, 1619-1918, p. 40</ref>\n\nThe [[Franco-Prussian War]] and the establishment of a [[German Empire]] in 1871, headed by [[Prussia]] and pointedly excluding any of the Austrian lands, let the state turn away from Germany and turn its gaze towards the [[Balkan Peninsula]]. Thereby the influence of [[pan-Germanism]] was diminished in the Habsburg territories, but as the term \"Austrians\" still was used supra-national, German-speaking Austrians considered themselves [[Germans]] (and were counted as such in the censuses). After Bismarck had excluded Austria from Germany, many Austrians faced a dilemma about their identity which prompted the Social Democratic Leader [[Otto Bauer]] to state that the dilemma was \"the conflict between our Austrian and German character.\"{{sfn|Bukey|2002|p=6}} The state as a whole tried to work out a sense of a distinctively Austrian identity.\n\nThe Austro-Hungarian Empire created ethnic conflict between the German Austrians and the other ethnic groups of the empire.

On October 16, 1918, emperor Karl I invited the nations of Austria to create national councils, with the aim to instigate a restructuring of the state under Habsburg rule. The nations followed the invitation (the Czechs had founded their national council already before the invitation) but ignored the will of the emperor to keep them in a restructured Austrian state. Their goal was total independence. \n[[File:Kurt Schuschnigg 1934.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Kurt Schuschnigg]] rejected the Nazis desire for an ''Anschluss'' and tried his best to keep Austria as an independent country.]]\nOn October 21, the German members of the Austrian parliament, elected in 1911, met in Vienna to found the Provisional National Assembly of German Austria (\"Provisorische Nationalversammlung f\u00fcr Deutsch\u00f6sterreich\"). On October 30, 1918 they installed the first German Austrian government, leaving the question \"monarchy or republic\" open. ([[German nationalism in Austria|German nationalists]] and social democrats favoured the republic, the Christian Socialists wanted to keep the monarchy.) This government in the first days of November took over the duties of the last imperial-royal government in a peaceful way. Initially the new state adopted the name \"[[German Austria]]\", reflecting the republic being the German part of the old Austria and showing the popular desire to unite with the new German republic. On November 12, 1918, the provisional national assembly voted for the republic and for unification with Germany with a large majority. \n[[File:stephansdom O5.jpg|thumb|200px|Sign of the [[Austrian resistance]] movement at the Stephansdom in Vienna]]\nThe creation of the [[Czechoslovakia|Czecho-Slovak]] and [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes|South Slav states]], the dissolution of the [[real union]] with [[Hungary]], and the post-war treaties imposed by the victorious Allies combined to see the newly established Austrian republic both with the boundaries it has today, and a largely homogeneous German-speaking population. In the [[Treaty of Saint-Germain]], in September 1919 the union with Germany was prohibited, and the new republic's name \"Deutsch\u00f6sterreich\" was prohibited by the treaty; instead the term \"Republic of Austria\" was used. The westernmost province [[Vorarlberg]]'s wish to unite with Switzerland was also ignored. On October 21, 1919, the state changed its name accordingly. Many German Austrian communities were left scattered throughout the other new states, especially in Czechoslovakia, where more than 3 million [[German Bohemians]] had not been allowed to become part of the new Austrian state, as well as in the southern part of Tyrol which now found itself part of Italy. In total, more than 3.5 million German-speaking Austrians were forced to remain outside the Austrian state.\n\nThe collapse of the empire caused an apparent struggle for some German Austrians between an \"Austrian\" and a \"German\" character.{{sfn|Bukey|2002|p=8}} The idea of unifying Austria with Germany was motivated both by a sense of a common German [[national identity]], and also by a fear that the new state, stripped of its one-time imperial possessions, and surrounded by potentially hostile nation-states, would not be economically viable. An Austrian identity emerged to some degree during the First Republic, and although Austria was still considered part of the ''\"German nation\"'' by most, [[Austrian nationalism|Austrian patriotism]] was encouraged by the anti-Nazi/anti-Socialist clerico-authoritarianist state ideology known as [[Austrofascism]] from 1934-38. The [[Engelbert Dollfuss]]/[[Kurt von Schuschnigg]] government accepted that Austria was a \"German state\" and believed Austrians were \"better Germans\", but strongly opposed the annexing of Austria to the Third Reich.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Vsl6mwMXl4YC&pg=PA37|title=Constructing and Deconstructing National Identity: Dramatic Discourse in Tom Murphy's The Patriot Game and Felix Mitterer's In Der L\u00f6wengrube|first=Birgit|last=Ryschka|date=1 January 2008|publisher=Peter Lang|via=Google Books}}</ref>\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1985-083-10, Anschluss \u00d6sterreich, Wien.jpg|thumb|200px|Austrians greeting the Nazis during the ''Anschluss'' in Vienna]]\nBy March 1938, with [[Nazi]] governments in control of both Berlin and Vienna, the country was annexed to Germany (''[[Anschluss]]'') as ''[[Ostmark (Austria)|Ostmark]]''.

The Austro-Bavarian dialects are considered to belong either to the [[Central Austro-Bavarian]] or [[Southern Austro-Bavarian]] subgroups, with the latter encompassing the languages of the [[State of Tyrol|Tyrol]], [[Carinthia (state)|Carinthia]], and [[Styria]] and the former including the dialects of [[Vienna]], [[Burgenland]], [[Upper Austria]], and [[Lower Austria]].

Composers of the 18th and 19th centuries were drawn to the city by the patronage of the [[Habsburg]]s, and made Vienna the European capital of classical music. [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]], [[Franz Schubert]] and [[Johann Strauss II|Johann Strauss, Jr.]], among others, were associated with the city. During the [[Baroque]] period, [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] and [[Magyars|Hungarian]] folk forms influenced Austrian music.\n\n===Literature===\n{{Main|Austrian literature}}\n{{See also|List of Austrian writers}}\n\nComplementing its status as a land of artists, Austria has always been a country of great poets, writers, and novelists. It was the home of novelists [[Arthur Schnitzler]], [[Stefan Zweig]], [[Thomas Bernhard]], and [[Robert Musil]], and of poets [[Georg Trakl]], [[Franz Werfel]], [[Franz Grillparzer]], [[Rainer Maria Rilke]], and [[Adalbert Stifter]]. Famous contemporary Austrian playwrights and novelists include [[Elfriede Jelinek]] and [[Peter Handke]]. Writers of philosophy include [[Ernst Mach]], [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], [[Karl Popper]] and the members of the [[Vienna circle]].\n\n===Cuisine===\n{{Main|Austrian Cuisine}}\nAustrian cuisine, which is often incorrectly equated with Viennese cuisine, is derived from the cuisine of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]]. In addition to native regional traditions it has been influenced above all by German, [[Hungarian cuisine|Hungarian]], [[Czech cuisine|Czech]], [[Jewish cuisine|Jewish]], [[Italian cuisine|Italian]] and [[Polish cuisine|Polish]] cuisines, from which both dishes and methods of food preparation have often been borrowed. Goulash is one example of this. Austrian cuisine is known primarily in the rest of the world for its pastries and sweets.\n\n===Religion===\n{{main|Religion in Austria}}\nThe majority of Austrians are traditionally [[Roman Catholic]].\n[[Roman Catholicism in Austria]] has played a significant role both in the [[culture of Austria|culture]] and in the [[politics of Austria]]. It enabled the [[House of Habsburg]] to rule [[Habsburg Spain|Spain]] and [[Spanish Empire|its empire]] as a [[Catholic Monarch]]y from the 16th century, and it determined the role of [[Archduchy of Austria|Habsburg Austria]] in the [[Thirty Years' War]]. The music in the tradition of [[Viennese classicism]] is [[sacral music|sacral]] to a significant extent, including works such as [[Mozart]]'s [[Great Mass in C minor]], [[List of masses by Joseph Haydn|masses by Joseph Haydn]] (1750-1802), [[Beethoven]]'s [[Mass in C major (Beethoven)|Mass in C major]] (1807), down to [[Bruckner]]'s [[Te Deum]] (1903).\n\n[[post-Christian Europe|Secularism]] has been on the rise since the 1980s. An estimated 66% of Austrians adhered to Roman Catholicism in 2009, compared to 78% in 1991 and 89% in 1961.\nThere is a traditional [[Lutheran]] minority, accounting for 4% of the population in 2009 (down from 6% in 1961). An estimated 17% are [[nonreligious]] (as of 2005).\n\n[[Islam in Austria]] has grown rapidly during the 1990s and 2000s, rising from 0.8% in 1971 to an estimated 6% in 2010, overtaking the traditional size of the Lutheran community in Austria.<ref>[http://islamineurope.blogspot.com/2007/12/austria-muslims-to-overtake-protestants.html islamineurope.blogspot.com], citing Austrian census figures.</ref> This rapid growth was due to the significant [[immigration to Austria]] from [[Turks in Austria|Turkey]] and [[Former Yugoslavia]] during the 1990s to 2000s.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Austria}}\n{{Wikiquote}}\n* [[Demographics of Austria]]\n* [[Austrian American]]\n* [[Austrian Brazilian]]\n* [[Austrian Canadians]]\n* [[Austro-Bavarian]]\n* [[German nationalism in Austria]]\n* [[Germanic peoples]]\n* [[List of Austrians]]\n* [[Studentenverbindung]]\n\n==References==\n{{notelist}}\n\n===Citations===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n* {{cite book|last1=Bischof|first1=G\u00fcnter|authorlink1=G\u00fcnter Bischof|last2=Pelinka|first2=Anton|authorlink2=Anton Pelinka|title=Austrian historical memory & national identity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=75l45XlpXTsC&pg=PA3|year=1997|publisher=Transaction Publishers|isbn=978-1-56000-902-3|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last=Bukey|first=Evan Burr|title=Hitler's Austria: Popular Sentiment in the Nazi Era, 1938-1945|publisher=University North Carolina|year=2002|isbn=0807853631|ref=harv|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/hitlersaustriapo0000buke_n8x4}}\n* {{cite book|last=Hamann|first=Brigitte|title=Hitler's Vienna: A Dictator's Apprenticeship|publisher=Tauris Parke|year=2010|isbn=1848852770|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last=Low|first=Alfred D.|title=The Anschluss Movement, 1918-1919, and the Paris Peace Conference|publisher=Amer Philosophical Society|year=1974|isbn=0871691035|ref=harv}}\n\n{{Ethnic groups in Austria}}\n{{Austria topics}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Austrian people]]\n[[Category:Germanic ethnic groups]]\n[[Category:Ethnic groups in Austria]]\n[[Category:Baiuvarii]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Nation and an ethnic group of people living in Austria}}\n{{Hatnote|For a specific analysis of the population of Austria, see [[Demographics of Austria]]}}\n{{hatnote|For an analysis on the nationality or Austrian citizenship, see [[Austrian nationality law]].}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=August 2016}}\n{{Infobox ethnic group\n| group        = Austrians\n| native_name  = \u00d6sterreicher\n| image        = \n| caption      = \n| pop          = {{circa}} 8\u20138.5 million\n| regions      = {{Flagcountry|Austria}} {{nbsp|6}} 6.75 million (2011){{efn|In 2011, [[Statistik Austria]] estimated that 81% or 6.75 million residents of Austria had no migration background and more than 19% or 1.6 million inhabitants had both parents of migration background or were born in a foreign country.}}<ref name=\"medienservicestelle.at\">{{cite web |url=http://medienservicestelle.at/migration_bewegt/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/IBIB_2012_Integrationsbericht.pdf |format=PDF |publisher=Statistik Austria |title=Kommission f\u00fcr Migrations und Integrationsforschung der \u00d6sterreichischen Akademie der Wissenschaften |year=2012 |page=27}} (total population to calculate percentages with is on page 23)</ref>\n|region1       = {{Flagcountry|United States}}\n| pop1         = 684,184\n| ref1         = <ref>[http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ACS_13_1YR_B04003&prodType=table Results &nbsp;] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20200212212204/http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ACS_13_1YR_B04003&prodType=table |date=February 12, 2020 }} American Fact Finder (US Census Bureau)</ref>\n| region2      = {{Flagcountry|Germany}}\n| pop2         = 345,620\n| ref2         = <ref>{{cite web|url=https://ergebnisse.zensus2011.de/#dynTable:statUnit=PERSON;absRel=ANZAHL;ags=00,02,01,13,03,05,09,14,16,08,15,12,11,10,07,06,04;agsAxis=X;yAxis=MHGLAND_HLND|title=Zensusdatenbank -

This word is derived from ''[[Ostarr\u00eechi]]'', which first appears in 996. This, in turn, is probably a translation of the Latin ''[[Marcha Orientalis]]'', which means \"eastern borderland\" (viz. delimiting the eastern border of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]). It was a [[margraviate]] of the [[Duchy of Bavaria]], ruled by the [[House of Babenberg]] from AD 976.\nDuring the 12th century, the ''Marcha Orientalis'' under the Babenbergs became independent of Bavaria. What is today known as [[Lower Austria]] corresponds to the ''Marcha Orientalis'', while [[Upper Austria]] corresponds to the eastern half of the core territory of Bavaria (the western half forming part of the [[States of Germany|German state]] of [[Bavaria]]).\n\nThe adjective ''Austrian'' entered the English language in the early 17th century, at the time referring to [[Archduchy of Austria|Habsburg Austria]] in the sense of \"members of the Austrian branch of the [[House of Habsburg]]\" (the junior branch emerging from the dynastic split into Austrian and Spanish Habsburgs in 1521), but from the 18th century also \"a native or inhabitant of Austria\".<ref>[[OED]] s.g. \"Austrian, ''adj.'' and ''n.''\"</ref>\n\n== History ==\n\n===Early history===\n[[File:Hallstatt LaTene.png|thumb|300px|Overview of the [[Hallstatt culture|Hallstatt]] and [[La T\u00e8ne culture|La T\u00e8ne]] cultures:\n{{legend|#f6bc0a|The core Hallstatt territory (HaC, 800 BC) is shown in solid yellow, }}\nThe territories of some major [[List of Celtic tribes|Celtic tribes]] of the late La T\u00e8ne period are labelled.]]\nThe territory of what is today Austria in the [[Roman Empire|Roman era]] was divided into [[Raetia]], [[Noricum]] and [[Pannonia]].\nNoricum was a [[Celt]]ic kingdom, while the ''[[Pannonians|Pannonii]]'' were of [[Illyrians|Illyrian]] stock. The [[Raetians]] were an ancient [[history of the Alps|alpine]] people probably akin to the [[Etruscans]]. During the [[Migration period]] (c. 6th century), these territories were settled by the [[Bavarians]] and other [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] groups in the west ([[Alemanni]] in [[Vorarlberg]], [[Lombards]] in [[Tyrol (region)|Tyrol]]), and by [[Slavic settlement of the Eastern Alps|Slavic]] groups, [[Huns]] and [[Avars (Carpathians)|Avars]] in the east. In the 8th century, the former territories of Raetia and Noricum fell under [[Carolingian Empire|Carolingian rule]], and were divided into the duchies of [[Swabia]], [[Bavaria]] and [[Duchy of Carinthia|Carinthia]]. Pannonia until the end of the 8th century was part of the [[Avar Khaganate]]. The \"[[Margraviate of Austria|East March]]\" (''Ostmark'') during the 9th century was the boundary region separating [[East Francia]] from the Avars and the [[Magyars]]. The site of [[Vienna]] had been settled since Celtic times (as ''[[Vindobona]]''), but the city only rose to importance in the [[High Middle Ages]] as the chief settlement of the March of Austria (the [[Morava (river)|March river]] just east of Vienna marks the ancient border between Francia and the Avars).\n\nAfter the defeat of the Magyars at the [[Battle of Lechfeld]] in 955, the East March or [[March of Austria]] came to be the easternmost portion of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], bordering on [[Moravia]] to the north and on the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] to the east.\nAs a consequence, the national character of the [[Austro-Bavarian]] speaking majority population of Austria throughout their early modern and modern history remained characterized by their neighbourhood to the [[West Slavs]] ([[Czechs]], [[Slovaks]]) to the north, the [[South Slavs]] ([[Slovenians]], [[Carinthian Slovenes]], [[Burgenland Croats]]) to the south, and the [[Hungarians]] to the east.\n\nThe unification of the various territories of Austria outside of the March of Austria proper\n(i.e. parts of Bavaria, Swabia and Carinthia) was a gradual process of [[feudalism|feudal politics]] during the High and Late Middle Ages, at first in the [[Archduchy of Austria]] under the [[House of Babenberg]] during the 12th to 13th centuries, and under the [[House of Habsburg]] after 1278 and throughout the 14th and 15th centuries. The various populations of these territories were not unified under the single name of \"Austrians\" before the [[early modern period]].\n\n===Early Modern period===\n{{Further|Habsburg Austria}}\n[[File:Growth of Habsburg territories.jpg|thumb|300px|Growth of the Habsburg Monarchy]]\nThe [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]], who had ruled the territory of Austria since the [[Late Middle Ages]], greatly increased their political prestige and power with the acquisition of the lands of the crowns of [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]] and [[Bohemia]] in 1526. The Hungarian aristocracy was more successful at retaining the [[Magyars]]' cultural and political preponderance in multi-ethnic Hungary than Bohemia, on three sides surrounded by German neighbours, which underwent a period of intense German colonisation, [[Germanization|germanizing]] the leading classes of the [[Czechs|Czech]] people as well. The common German identity of lands such as Carinthia, Styria, or Tyrol, and the ruling dynasty made it easier for these lands to accept the central government set up in Vienna in the mid-18th century.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nThe term Austrian in these times was used for identifying subjects of the Domus Austriae, the House of Austria, as the dynasty was called in Europe, regardless of their ethnic ancestry. Although not formally a united state, the lands ruled by the Habsburgs would sometimes be known by the name \"Austria\". In reality they remained a disparate range of semi-autonomous states, most of which were part of the complex network of states that was the [[Holy Roman Empire]] (the imperial institutions of which were themselves controlled for much of their later existence by the Habsburgs). However, the second half of the 18th century saw an increasingly centralised state begin to develop under the reign of [[Maria Theresa of Austria]] and her son [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]].\n\nAfter the [[French Revolution]] and the rise of [[Napoleon]], the emperor [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Franz II]] formally founded the [[Austrian Empire]] in 1804 and became as ''Franz I'' the first Austrian emperor. For the first time the citizens of the various territories were now subjects of the one same state, while most of the German states, [[Prussia]] excluded, still cultivated their [[Kleinstaaterei]] and didn't succeed in forming a homogenous empire. Following Prussia's victory in the [[Austro-Prussian war]] in 1866, [[Otto von Bismarck]] successfully unified the [[German Empire]] in 1871, which was Prussian-dominated, without the inclusion of Austria and the German Austrians.<ref>Mark Allinson, Germany and Austria 1814-2000, pp. 23-29</ref>\n\nAfter Austria was excluded from Germany in 1866, the following year Austria joined Hungary as a dual empire known as the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]]. A further major change resulted from a reorganisation of the Austrian Empire in 1867 into a [[dual monarchy]], acknowledging the Kingdom of Hungary as an independent state bound to the remaining part of the empire, as well independent, by a personal and real union, the Emperor of Austria being the Apostolic King of Hungary (with both titles on the same level). The Austrian half, a patchwork of crown-lands, broadly coterminous with the modern-day Austria, the [[Czech Republic]], [[Slovenia]], and parts of [[Poland]], [[Ukraine]], [[Italy]], and [[Croatia]], was bound together by the common constitution of 1867, stating that all subjects now would carry \"uniform Austrian citizenship\" and have the same fundamental rights. These non-Hungarian lands were not officially called the Austrian Empire. Until 1915, they were officially called \"the Kingdoms and States Represented in the Imperial Council\" and politicians used the technical term [[Cisleithania]] (labelling the Hungarian lands as [[Transleithania]]). The general public called them Austria, and in 1915, the non-parliamentary Cisleithanian government decreed to use this term officially, too.\n\n===19th-century nationalism===\n{{main|Austrian nationalism|Austria\u2013Prussia rivalry|German nationalism|German nationalism in Austria|Pan-Germanism}}\n[[File:Map-GermanConfederation.svg|thumb|240px|left|[[Central Europe]] (ca 1820) showing the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] (blue), the [[Austrian Empire]] (yellow) and other independent German states (grey). The red line marks the border of the German Confederation; both Prussia and Austria controlled lands outside the Confederation.]]\n\nThe idea of grouping all [[Germans]] into one nation-state gave way to a rapid rise of German nationalism within the [[German Confederation]], especially in the two most powerful German states, Austria and Prussia. The question of how a unified Germany was to be formed was a matter of debate. The [[German Question]] was to be solved by either unifying all German-speaking peoples under one state as the \"Greater German solution\" (''Gro\u00dfdeutsche L\u00f6sung''), which was promoted by the Austrian Empire and its supporters. On the other hand, the \"Lesser German solution\" (''Kleindeutsche L\u00f6sung'') advocated only to unify the northern German states and exclude Austria; this proposal was favored by the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] and its supporters. This debate became known as [[German dualism]].\n\nThe lands later called Cisleithania (except [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]] and [[Dalmatia]]) were members of the German Confederation since 1815 as they had been part of the Holy Roman Empire until 1806. Until 1848, Austria and its chancellor Prince [[Metternich]] unanimously dominated the confederation. The developing sense of a German nationality had been accelerated massively as a consequence of the political turmoil and wars that engulfed [[Central Europe]] following the [[French Revolution]] and the rise to power of [[Napoleon Bonaparte]]. Although the years of peace after Napoleon's fall quickly saw German nationalism largely pushed out of the public political arena by reactionary absolutism, the [[Revolutions of 1848]] established it as a significant political issue for a period of nearly hundred years.\n[[File:Deutscher Bund.svg|thumb|240px|A map of the German Confederation in 1849 showing the 39 independent states.]]\nPolitical debate now centred on the nature of a possible future German state to replace the Confederation, and part of that debate concerned the issue of whether or not the Austrian lands had a place in the German polity. When Emperor Franz Joseph I ordered to build a monument in Vienna in 1860 to [[Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen|Archduke Charles]], victor over Napoleon in the [[Battle of Aspern-Essling]] in 1809, it carried the dedication \"To the persistent fighter for Germany's honour\", to underline the Germanic mission of the House of Austria.\n\nThe idea of uniting all ethnic Germans into one nation-state began to be challenged in Austria by the rise of [[Austrian nationalism]], especially within the [[Christian Social Party (Austria)|Christian Social Party]] that identified Austrians on the basis of their predominantly Catholic religious identity as opposed to the predominantly Protestant religious identity of the Prussians.<ref>Spohn, Willfried (2005), \"Austria: From Habsburg Empire to a Small Nation in Europe\", Entangled identities: nations and Europe, Ashgate, p. 61</ref>\n\nHabsburg influence over the German Confederation, which was strongest in the southern member states, was rivalled by the increasingly powerful [[Prussia]]n state. Political manoeuvering by the Prussian [[chancellor]] [[Otto von Bismarck]] resulted in military defeat of the Austrians in the Austro-Prussian War of 1866 and the collapse of the Confederation, both effectively ending any future Austrian influence on German\npolitical events.\n\nWhen asked by Edward VII to abandon Austria-Hungary's alliance with Germany for co-operation with England, Franz Joseph replied \"I am a German prince.\"<ref>(\"Ich bin ein Deutscher F\u00fcrst\") Walter Wiltschegg: \u00d6sterreich, der \"zweite deutsche Staat\"?: der nationale Gedanke in der Ersten Republik, Stocker, 1992, p. 41 (German)</ref><ref>Richard Bassett, For God and Kaiser: The Imperial Austrian Army, 1619-1918, p. 40</ref>\n\nThe [[Franco-Prussian War]] and the establishment of a [[German Empire]] in 1871, headed by [[Prussia]] and pointedly excluding any of the Austrian lands, let the state turn away from Germany and turn its gaze towards the [[Balkan Peninsula]]. Thereby the influence of [[pan-Germanism]] was diminished in the Habsburg territories, but as the term \"Austrians\" still was used supra-national, German-speaking Austrians considered themselves [[Germans]] (and were counted as such in the censuses). After Bismarck had excluded Austria from Germany, many Austrians faced a dilemma about their identity which prompted the Social Democratic Leader [[Otto Bauer]] to state that the dilemma was \"the conflict between our Austrian and German character.\"{{sfn|Bukey|2002|p=6}} The state as a whole tried to work out a sense of a distinctively Austrian identity.\n\nThe Austro-Hungarian Empire created ethnic conflict between the German Austrians and the other ethnic groups of the empire.

On October 16, 1918, emperor Karl I invited the nations of Austria to create national councils, with the aim to instigate a restructuring of the state under Habsburg rule. The nations followed the invitation (the Czechs had founded their national council already before the invitation) but ignored the will of the emperor to keep them in a restructured Austrian state. Their goal was total independence. \n[[File:Kurt Schuschnigg 1934.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Kurt Schuschnigg]] rejected the Nazis desire for an ''Anschluss'' and tried his best to keep Austria as an independent country.]]\nOn October 21, the German members of the Austrian parliament, elected in 1911, met in Vienna to found the Provisional National Assembly of German Austria (\"Provisorische Nationalversammlung f\u00fcr Deutsch\u00f6sterreich\"). On October 30, 1918 they installed the first German Austrian government, leaving the question \"monarchy or republic\" open. ([[German nationalism in Austria|German nationalists]] and social democrats favoured the republic, the Christian Socialists wanted to keep the monarchy.) This government in the first days of November took over the duties of the last imperial-royal government in a peaceful way. Initially the new state adopted the name \"[[German Austria]]\", reflecting the republic being the German part of the old Austria and showing the popular desire to unite with the new German republic. On November 12, 1918, the provisional national assembly voted for the republic and for unification with Germany with a large majority. \n[[File:stephansdom O5.jpg|thumb|200px|Sign of the [[Austrian resistance]] movement at the Stephansdom in Vienna]]\nThe creation of the [[Czechoslovakia|Czecho-Slovak]] and [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes|South Slav states]], the dissolution of the [[real union]] with [[Hungary]], and the post-war treaties imposed by the victorious Allies combined to see the newly established Austrian republic both with the boundaries it has today, and a largely homogeneous German-speaking population. In the [[Treaty of Saint-Germain]], in September 1919 the union with Germany was prohibited, and the new republic's name \"Deutsch\u00f6sterreich\" was prohibited by the treaty; instead the term \"Republic of Austria\" was used. The westernmost province [[Vorarlberg]]'s wish to unite with Switzerland was also ignored. On October 21, 1919, the state changed its name accordingly. Many German Austrian communities were left scattered throughout the other new states, especially in Czechoslovakia, where more than 3 million [[German Bohemians]] had not been allowed to become part of the new Austrian state, as well as in the southern part of Tyrol which now found itself part of Italy. In total, more than 3.5 million German-speaking Austrians were forced to remain outside the Austrian state.\n\nThe collapse of the empire caused an apparent struggle for some German Austrians between an \"Austrian\" and a \"German\" character.{{sfn|Bukey|2002|p=8}} The idea of unifying Austria with Germany was motivated both by a sense of a common German [[national identity]], and also by a fear that the new state, stripped of its one-time imperial possessions, and surrounded by potentially hostile nation-states, would not be economically viable. An Austrian identity emerged to some degree during the First Republic, and although Austria was still considered part of the ''\"German nation\"'' by most, [[Austrian nationalism|Austrian patriotism]] was encouraged by the anti-Nazi/anti-Socialist clerico-authoritarianist state ideology known as [[Austrofascism]] from 1934-38. The [[Engelbert Dollfuss]]/[[Kurt von Schuschnigg]] government accepted that Austria was a \"German state\" and believed Austrians were \"better Germans\", but strongly opposed the annexing of Austria to the Third Reich.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Vsl6mwMXl4YC&pg=PA37|title=Constructing and Deconstructing National Identity: Dramatic Discourse in Tom Murphy's The Patriot Game and Felix Mitterer's In Der L\u00f6wengrube|first=Birgit|last=Ryschka|date=1 January 2008|publisher=Peter Lang|via=Google Books}}</ref>\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1985-083-10, Anschluss \u00d6sterreich, Wien.jpg|thumb|200px|Austrians greeting the Nazis during the ''Anschluss'' in Vienna]]\nBy March 1938, with [[Nazi]] governments in control of both Berlin and Vienna, the country was annexed to Germany (''[[Anschluss]]'') as ''[[Ostmark (Austria)|Ostmark]]''.

It proved favourable for Austrians not to be held guilty for World War II, genocide and war crimes, since [[Austria \u2014 the Nazis' first victim|Austria was considered a ''victim'' of Nazi Germany]], although some historians call this a \"big lie\" and have challenged this statement.{{sfn|Bischof|Pelinka|1997|pp=3\u2013}}\n\nUnlike earlier in the 20th century, in 1987 only 6% of Austrians identified themselves as \"Germans\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://iiss210.joanneum.at/demokratiezentrum2/media/pdf/bruckmueller.pdf. |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-07-22 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928041605/http://iiss210.joanneum.at/demokratiezentrum2/media/pdf/bruckmueller.pdf |archivedate=September 28, 2007 }} Development of the Austrian identity .</ref> Today over 90% of the Austrians see themselves as an independent nation.<ref>[http://derstandard.at/?url=/?id=3261105 \u00d6sterreicher f\u00fchlen sich heute als Nation - 1938 - derStandard.at \u203a Wissenschaft<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.photoglobe.info/ebooks/austria/cstudies_austria_0070.html Austria.

Barnes & Noble Publishing, 1996. P. 20.</ref>\n\nAustria's multicultural history and geographical location has resulted in post-Soviet era immigration from [[Slovenia]], the [[Czech Republic]], [[Hungary]], [[Slovakia]], [[Romania]], and [[Poland]]. As with neighbouring Germany, there has also been heavy immigration from [[Turkey]] and former [[Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] states such as [[Croatia]] and [[Serbia]].\n\n==Language==\n{{main|German language|High German languages}}\nAustrians have historically spoken the German language. The sole official language at the federal level of Austria is German, and the standard used is called [[Austrian German]] since German is considered a [[pluricentric language]], like English. Austrian German is defined by the [[Austrian Dictionary]] ({{lang-de|\u00d6sterreichisches W\u00f6rterbuch}}), published under the authority of the Austrian [[Federal Ministry of Education, Arts and Culture]]. Thus, all websites, official announcements and most of the media are carried out in Austrian German. The [[minority language]]s [[Slovene language|Slovene]], [[Croatian language|Croatian]] and [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] are spoken and officially recognized.\n\nIn terms of native language, it is generally not Austrian German that is used, but instead local dialects of the [[Austro-Bavarian]] and [[Alemannic German|Allemannic]] (in [[Vorarlberg]] and the Tiroler Au\u00dferfern) family. The Austro-Bavarian dialects are considered to belong either to the [[Central Austro-Bavarian]] or [[Southern Austro-Bavarian]] subgroups, with the latter encompassing the languages of the [[State of Tyrol|Tyrol]], [[Carinthia (state)|Carinthia]], and [[Styria]] and the former including the dialects of [[Vienna]], [[Burgenland]], [[Upper Austria]], and [[Lower Austria]]. The vast majority of Austrians are however able to speak Austrian Standard German in addition to their native dialect, as it is taught in all modern day schools.\n\n==Naturalization==\n{{main|Austrian nationality law|Immigration to Austria}}\nLike most of [[Central Europe]], Austria has had high levels of [[immigration to Europe|immigration]] since the 1970s. As with [[Turks in Germany|Germany]], the largest immigrant group are [[Turks in Austria|Turks]]. An estimated total of 350,000 ethnic Turks lived in Austria in 2010, accounting for 3% of the Austrian population.<ref>{{Cite news|author=BBC|title=Turkey's ambassador to Austria prompts immigration spat|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-11725311|accessdate=2010-11-10|work=BBC News|date=November 10, 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe rate of [[naturalization]] has increased after 1995, since which dates Turks in Austria could retain their citizenship in [[Turkey]] after naturalization in Austria ([[dual citizenship]]). After 2007, the rate of naturalizations has decreased due to a stricter nationality law enacted by the Austrian legislature.<ref>{{citation |last=Baub\u00f6ck|first=Rainer|author-link=|year=2006|title=Migration and Citizenship: Legal Status, Rights and Political Participation\n|place=|publisher=Amsterdam University Press|isbn=90-5356-888-3}} p. 58.</ref>\nDuring the 2000s, an average number of 27,127 foreign nationals per year was naturalized as Austrian citizens, compared to an average 67,688 children per year born with Austrian nationality.<ref>\n[http://www.statistik.at/web_de/statistiken/bevoelkerung/einbuergerungen/index.html statistik.at] (years 2000&ndash;2009):\n*Naturalizations: 24320, 31731, 36011, 44694, 41645, 34876, 25746, 14010, 10258, 7978.\n*Births (Austrian nationality): 67694, 65741, 68474, 67861, 69902, 69023, 68662, 66864, 67348, 65312.\nThe rate of naturalizations was at about 7,700 per year during the 1980s. It rose to 16,000 in 1997, 25,000 in 1999, peaking at 45,000 in 2003. Since 2004 the figure has shown a decreasing trend, falling back to a 1970s level (below 7,000) by 2010.</ref>\n\nToday, the largest group of foreign nationals are Germans. As of January 2018 - 186,891 Germans lived in Austria.<ref>{{Cite news|author=Staista|title=Foreign Nationals living in Austria|url=https://de.statista.com/statistik/daten/studie/293019/umfrage/auslaender-in-oesterreich-nach-staatsangehoerigkeit/|work=Statista News|date=2018}}</ref>\n\nConsequently, an increasing portion of Austrians is not descended from the historical populations of Austria.\nWhile the term \"ethnic Austrian\" has mostly been reserved for the context of overseas emigration from Austria ([[Austrian American]]s, [[Austrian Canadian]]s etc.), it can more recently also be used to distinguish the indigenous population from the naturalized immigrant population. Thus, the rapid growth of [[Islam in Austria]] is due to the higher birth rate among immigrants compared to that among the indigenous \"ethnic Austrian\" population.<ref>\n''World and Its Peoples'', Volume 7: Europe, Marshall Cavendish Corporation, {{ISBN|978-0-7614-7894-2}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=gWobg3WoPJkC&pg=PA921&dq=%22ethnic+Austrians%22&hl=en&ei=1jV2TeeGG8Ws8AO985GgDA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=6&ved=0CEIQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=%22ethnic%20Austrians%22&f=false p. 921].</ref>\n\n==Culture==\n{{Main|Austrian culture}}\nAustrian culture has largely been influenced by its neighbours [[Switzerland]], [[Germany]], [[Italy]], [[Hungary]], the [[Balkans]] and [[Czech lands]].\n\n===Music===\n{{main|Music of Austria}}\n{{further|Music of Vienna}}\n[[Vienna]], the capital city of Austria has long been an important center of musical innovation. Composers of the 18th and 19th centuries were drawn to the city by the patronage of the [[Habsburg]]s, and made Vienna the European capital of classical music. [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]], [[Franz Schubert]] and [[Johann Strauss II|Johann Strauss, Jr.]], among others, were associated with the city. During the [[Baroque]] period, [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] and [[Magyars|Hungarian]] folk forms influenced Austrian music.\n\n===Literature===\n{{Main|Austrian literature}}\n{{See also|List of Austrian writers}}\n\nComplementing its status as a land of artists, Austria has always been a country of great poets, writers, and novelists. It was the home of novelists [[Arthur Schnitzler]], [[Stefan Zweig]], [[Thomas Bernhard]], and [[Robert Musil]], and of poets [[Georg Trakl]], [[Franz Werfel]], [[Franz Grillparzer]], [[Rainer Maria Rilke]], and [[Adalbert Stifter]]. Famous contemporary Austrian playwrights and novelists include [[Elfriede Jelinek]] and [[Peter Handke]]. Writers of philosophy include [[Ernst Mach]], [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], [[Karl Popper]] and the members of the [[Vienna circle]].\n\n===Cuisine===\n{{Main|Austrian Cuisine}}\nAustrian cuisine, which is often incorrectly equated with Viennese cuisine, is derived from the cuisine of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]]. In addition to native regional traditions it has been influenced above all by German, [[Hungarian cuisine|Hungarian]], [[Czech cuisine|Czech]], [[Jewish cuisine|Jewish]], [[Italian cuisine|Italian]] and [[Polish cuisine|Polish]] cuisines, from which both dishes and methods of food preparation have often been borrowed. Goulash is one example of this. Austrian cuisine is known primarily in the rest of the world for its pastries and sweets.\n\n===Religion===\n{{main|Religion in Austria}}\nThe majority of Austrians are traditionally [[Roman Catholic]].\n[[Roman Catholicism in Austria]] has played a significant role both in the [[culture of Austria|culture]] and in the [[politics of Austria]]. It enabled the [[House of Habsburg]] to rule [[Habsburg Spain|Spain]] and [[Spanish Empire|its empire]] as a [[Catholic Monarch]]y from the 16th century, and it determined the role of [[Archduchy of Austria|Habsburg Austria]] in the [[Thirty Years' War]]. The music in the tradition of [[Viennese classicism]] is [[sacral music|sacral]] to a significant extent, including works such as [[Mozart]]'s [[Great Mass in C minor]], [[List of masses by Joseph Haydn|masses by Joseph Haydn]] (1750-1802), [[Beethoven]]'s [[Mass in C major (Beethoven)|Mass in C major]] (1807), down to [[Bruckner]]'s [[Te Deum]] (1903).\n\n[[post-Christian Europe|Secularism]] has been on the rise since the 1980s. An estimated 66% of Austrians adhered to Roman Catholicism in 2009, compared to 78% in 1991 and 89% in 1961.\nThere is a traditional [[Lutheran]] minority, accounting for 4% of the population in 2009 (down from 6% in 1961). An estimated 17% are [[nonreligious]] (as of 2005).\n\n[[Islam in Austria]] has grown rapidly during the 1990s and 2000s, rising from 0.8% in 1971 to an estimated 6% in 2010, overtaking the traditional size of the Lutheran community in Austria.<ref>[http://islamineurope.blogspot.com/2007/12/austria-muslims-to-overtake-protestants.html islamineurope.blogspot.com], citing Austrian census figures.</ref> This rapid growth was due to the significant [[immigration to Austria]] from [[Turks in Austria|Turkey]] and [[Former Yugoslavia]] during the 1990s to 2000s.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Austria}}\n{{Wikiquote}}\n* [[Demographics of Austria]]\n* [[Austrian American]]\n* [[Austrian Brazilian]]\n* [[Austrian Canadians]]\n* [[Austro-Bavarian]]\n* [[German nationalism in Austria]]\n* [[Germanic peoples]]\n* [[List of Austrians]]\n* [[Studentenverbindung]]\n\n==References==\n{{notelist}}\n\n===Citations===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n* {{cite book|last1=Bischof|first1=G\u00fcnter|authorlink1=G\u00fcnter Bischof|last2=Pelinka|first2=Anton|authorlink2=Anton Pelinka|title=Austrian historical memory & national identity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=75l45XlpXTsC&pg=PA3|year=1997|publisher=Transaction Publishers|isbn=978-1-56000-902-3|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last=Bukey|first=Evan Burr|title=Hitler's Austria: Popular Sentiment in the Nazi Era, 1938-1945|publisher=University North Carolina|year=2002|isbn=0807853631|ref=harv|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/hitlersaustriapo0000buke_n8x4}}\n* {{cite book|last=Hamann|first=Brigitte|title=Hitler's Vienna: A Dictator's Apprenticeship|publisher=Tauris Parke|year=2010|isbn=1848852770|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last=Low|first=Alfred D.|title=The Anschluss Movement, 1918-1919, and the Paris Peace Conference|publisher=Amer Philosophical Society|year=1974|isbn=0871691035|ref=harv}}\n\n{{Ethnic groups in Austria}}\n{{Austria topics}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Austrian people]]\n[[Category:Germanic ethnic groups]]\n[[Category:Ethnic groups in Austria]]\n[[Category:Baiuvarii]]\n", "name_user": "82.28.193.183", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(Fixed something)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austrians"}

Although warships were used by the English kings from the early medieval period, the first major maritime engagements were fought in the [[Hundred Years' War]] against the [[Kingdom of France]]. The modern Royal Navy traces its origins to the early 16th century; the oldest of the UK's armed services, it is known as the '''Senior Service'''.\n\nFrom the middle decades of the 17th century, and through the 18th century, the Royal Navy vied with the [[Dutch Navy]] and later with the [[French Navy]] for maritime supremacy. From the mid 18th century, it was the world's most powerful navy until the [[Second World War]]. The Royal Navy played a key part in establishing the [[British Empire]] as the [[superpower|unmatched world power]] during the 19th and first part of the 20th centuries. Due to this historical prominence, it is common, even among non-Britons, to refer to it as \"the Royal Navy\" without qualification.\n\nFollowing [[World War I]], the Royal Navy was significantly reduced in size,<ref>Rose, ''Power at Sea'', p. 36</ref> although at the onset of [[World War II]] it was still the world's largest.

There is no evidence that William adopted or kept the Anglo-Saxon ship mustering system, known as the ''scipfryd.'' Hardly noted after 1066, it appears that the Normans let the ''scipfryd'' languish so that by 1086, when the [[Doomsday Book]] was completed, it had apparently ceased to exist.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Safeguard of the Sea, A Naval History of Britain 660\u20131649|last=Roger|first=N.|publisher=HarperCollins Publishers Ltd.|year=1997|isbn=|location=London|pages=38\u201339}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', in 1068, [[Harold Godwinson]]'s sons [[Godwin, son of Harold Godwinson|Godwine]] and [[Edmund, son of Harold Godwinson|Edmund]] conducted a \"raiding-ship army\" which came from Ireland, raiding across the region and to the townships of [[Bristol]] and [[Somerset]]. In the following year of 1069, they returned with a bigger fleet which they sailed up the River Taw before being beaten back by a local earl near [[Devon]]. However, this made explicitly clear that the newly conquered England under Norman rule, in effect, ceded the Irish Sea to the Irish, the Vikings of Dublin, and other Norwegians.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Medieval Maritime Wartime|last=Stanton|first=Charles|publisher=Pen & Sword Maritime|year=2015|isbn=|location=South Yorkshire|pages=225\u2013226}}</ref> Besides ceding away the Irish Sea, the Normans also ceded the North Sea, a major area where Nordic peoples traveled. In 1069, this lack of naval presence in the North Sea allowed for the invasion and ravaging of England by Jarl Osborn (brother of [[Sweyn II of Denmark|King Svein Estridsson]]) and his sons [[Harald III of Denmark|Harald]], [[Canute IV of Denmark|Cnut]], and Bjorn. In addition to the ravaging of the English townships of [[Dover]], [[Sandwich, Kent|Sandwich]], [[Ipswich]], and [[Norwich]], the Danes connected with the ''aetheling'' (Anglo-Saxon Heir to the crown) Edgar and rebels in Northumbria. William chased Edgar and the rebels to Scotland, but could not defeat the Danes, causing him to resort to the old Anglo-Saxon practice of paying them off.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Anglo-Saxon Chronicle|last=Michael|first=Swanton|publisher=|year=1069|isbn=|location=London|pages=202\u2013204}}</ref>\n\nThough William the Conqueror caused a massive decline in English naval practices, he did occasionally assemble small fleets of ships, but only for limited activities. Most of these limited actions also did not involve direct combat at sea. An example of this was when the rebellious Anglo-Saxon [[Morcar|Earl Morcar]] and his ally Bishop [[\u00c6thelwine (bishop of Durham)|\u00c6thelwine]] of Durham sought refuge on the [[Isle of Ely]] in 1071. According to [[Florence of Worcester]] reported, \"The king [William the Conqueror] hearing of this, blocked up every outlet on the eastern side by means of boatmen [butescarls], and caused a bridge two miles long to be constructed on the western side.\" The ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' also confirms these events. Though William used ships for blockading purposes and for important strategic engagements, his infrequent use of an established navy promoted a damaging practice of infrequent maritime operations, which his successors would practice on frequent basis.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Medieval Maritime Warfare|last=Stanton|first=Charles|publisher=Pen & Sword Maritime|year=2015|isbn=|location=South Yorkshire|page=226}}</ref>\n\nMedieval fleets, in England as elsewhere, were almost entirely composed of merchant ships enlisted into naval service in time of war. From time to time a few \"king's ships\" owned by the monarch were built for specifically warlike purposes; but, unlike some European states, England did not maintain a small permanent core of warships in peacetime. England's naval organisation was haphazard and the mobilization of fleets when war broke out was slow.<ref>Rodger, ''Safeguard'', pp. 52\u201353, 117\u2013130.</ref>\n\n=====Barons' Revolt and the evolving English Navy, 1215\u20131217=====\nWhen [[John, King of England|King John]]\u2019s campaign to recover Normandy from the French was at a breaking-point, the northern barons of England began to rise in revolt. Forced by the insurrection, John signed the [[Magna Carta]] on 15 June 1215, in hopes of satisfying the barons to buy time for [[Pope Innocent III]] to excommunicate the rebellious barons and condemn the Magna Carta. From this, the barons revolted, commencing the [[First Barons' War]] with the capture of [[Rochester Castle]]. Grasping, however, that they (the barons) were outmatched by royalists and King John, the barons decided to turn to France for assistance. Realizing the baron's intentions, John attempted to assemble a Navy, to prevent the arrival of the French.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Flowers of History|author=Roger of Wendover|author-link=Roger of Wendover|translator-last=Giles|translator-first=J.

With John unable to swiftly build up his navy, due to the adopting of infrequent maritime operations from William the Conqueror, the French Navy under Louis invaded and landed at Sandwich unopposed in April 1216.<ref name=\":0\" /> With Louis near London, John fled to [[Winchester]], where he would stay until his death on 19 October 1216, having his nine-year-old son [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] as heir to the throne.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Historie des Dues de Normandie et des Rois d'Angleterre|last=Michel|first=F.|publisher=|year=1840|isbn=|location=Paris|pages=172\u2013177}}</ref>\n\nParadoxically, John's death turned the tide against Louis, the rebellion in England, and the development of the English navy. [[William Marshal, 1st Earl of Pembroke]], who became regent to the son of the recently deceased English king, began to regain the loyalties to the royalist cause through a regimen of compromise. Among these were the [[Cinque Ports]], who had substantial amounts of maritime ships. With the English now having substantial amount of vessels, Louis returned to France to gather reinforcements and more maritime vessels. Though he succeeded, English vessels began to [[blockade]] and harass French shipping, trade, and blockaded multiple French-controlled English ports.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Historie des Ducs de Normandie|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=183\u2013185}}</ref>\n\nBy mid-1217, English royalists began to gain the advantage over the rebellious Barons and their French allies. Again needing more troops, Louis requested from his wife [[Blanche of Castile]] to assemble more troops for him. Up to the task, Blanche assisted in gathering forces for her husband, with a massive French force being assembled by August 1217, at the port of Calais. At the head of the French transports was [[Eustace the Monk]], Louis\u2019 best naval commander, who had helped Louis escape many English blockade, such as the one in Winchelsea&nbsp; in January 1217.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Medieval Maritime Warfare|last=Stanton|first=Charles|publisher=Pen & Sword Maritime|year=2015|isbn=|location=|page=232}}</ref>\n\nThe subsequent encounter between the two fleets came in the Downs off Sandwich, known as the [[Battle of Sandwich (1217)|Battle of Sandwich]]. For the first time in northern waters a decisive naval battle was fought on the open sea. The battle was dominated by the English, with French losing almost all of their ships, including Eustace the Monk who was killed in the action that took place. With the death of Eustace the Monk and the defeat of the French at Sandwich, William Marshal was able to isolate Louis in London, compelling him to renounce his claim to the English throne and force him to return to France.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Historie des Ducs de Normandie|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=198\u2013205}}</ref>\n\n=====Scottish and English Navies, 1249\u20131318===== \nThere are mentions in medieval records of fleets commanded by Scottish kings including [[William the Lion]]<ref name=\"Tytler1829pp309-10\">P.

Early in the war French plans for an invasion of England failed when [[Edward III of England]] destroyed the French fleet in the [[Battle of Sluys]] in 1340.<ref>Rodger, ''Safeguard'', pp. 93\u201399.</ref> Major fighting was thereafter confined to French soil and England's naval capabilities sufficed to transport armies and supplies safely to their continental destinations. However, while subsequent French invasion schemes came to nothing, England's naval forces could not prevent frequent raids on the south-coast ports by the French and their [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] and [[Crown of Castile|Castilian]] allies. Such raids halted finally only with the occupation of northern France by [[Henry V of England|Henry V]].<ref>Rodger, ''Safeguard'', pp. 91\u201397, 99\u2013116, 143\u2013144.</ref>\n\n[[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] deserves a large share of credit in fostering sea power.

This was largely focused on the west coast, with the Exchequer Rolls of 1326 recording the feudal duties of his vassals in that region to aid him with their vessels and crews. Towards the end of his reign he supervised the building of at least one royal [[man-of-war]] near his palace at [[Cardross, Argyll and Bute|Cardross]] on the [[River Clyde]].

Despite having to completely replace its war fleet, the Navy managed to maintain its overwhelming advantage over all potential rivals. Due to British leadership in the [[Industrial Revolution]], the country enjoyed unparalleled shipbuilding capacity and financial resources, which ensured that no rival could take advantage of these revolutionary changes to negate the British advantage in ship numbers.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.historyextra.com/period/georgian/how-did-britain-come-to-rule-the-waves/|title=How did Britain come to rule the waves?|publisher=History Extra|accessdate=6 March 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190307054023/https://www.historyextra.com/period/georgian/how-did-britain-come-to-rule-the-waves/|archive-date=7 March 2019|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n[[File:HMS Warrior armoured frigate 9,137 tons, Royal Navy (first armour-plated, iron-hulled warship.)

The Navy's [[Northern Patrol]] closed off access to the [[North Sea]], while the [[Dover Patrol]] closed off access to the [[English Channel]]. The Navy also mined the North Sea. As well as closing off the Imperial German Navy's access to the Atlantic, the blockade largely blocked neutral merchant shipping heading to or from [[German Empire|Germany]]. The blockade was maintained during the eight months after the armistice was agreed to force Germany to end the war and sign the [[Treaty of Versailles]].<ref>Osbourne, Eric W. (2004).

For much of the war this submarine campaign was restricted by [[prize rules]] requiring merchant ships to be warned and evacuated before sinking. In 1915, the Germans renounced these restrictions and began to sink merchant ships on sight, but later returned to the previous [[rules of engagement]] to placate neutral opinion. A resumption of unrestricted submarine warfare in 1917 raised the prospect of Britain and its allies being starved into submission. The Navy's response to this new form of warfare had proved inadequate due to its refusal to adopt a [[convoy]] system for merchant shipping, despite the demonstrated effectiveness of the technique in protecting troop ships. The belated introduction of convoys sharply reduced losses and brought the U-boat threat under control.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/british-naval-convoy-system-introduced|title=British naval convoy system introduced|publisher=History|accessdate=30 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171231051642/http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/british-naval-convoy-system-introduced|archive-date=31 December 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n[[File:HMS Ark Royal h85716.jpg|thumb|{{HMS|Ark Royal|91|6}}]]\nIn the inter-war period, the Royal Navy was stripped of much of its power.

A traditional convoy system was instituted from the start of the war, but German submarine tactics, based on group attacks by \"[[Wolfpack (naval tactic)|wolf-packs]]\", were much more effective than in the previous war, and the threat remained serious for well over three years. Defences were strengthened by deployment of purpose-built escorts, of [[escort carrier]]s, of long-range patrol aircraft, improved anti-submarine weapons and sensors, and by the deciphering of German signals by the code-breakers of [[Bletchley Park]]. The threat was at last effectively broken by devastating losses inflicted on the U-boats in the spring of 1943. Intense convoy battles of a different sort, against combined air, surface and submarine threats, were fought off enemy-controlled coasts in [[Arctic convoys of World War II|the Arctic]], where Britain ran supply convoys through to Russia, and in the Mediterranean, where the struggle focused on [[Malta convoys|Convoys to Malta]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.melbournestar.co.uk/Operation_Pedestal.html|title=Operation Pedestal|publisher=Melbourne Star|accessdate=30 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171223001713/http://www.melbournestar.co.uk/Operation_Pedestal.html|archive-date=23 December 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe Navy was also vital in guarding the sea lanes that enabled British forces to fight in North Africa, the Mediterranean and the Far East.

All of the pre-war ships (except for the {{sclass2-|Town|cruiser|0||1936}} light cruisers) were quickly retired and most sold for scrapping over the years 1945\u20131948, and only the best condition ships (the four surviving ''King George V''-class battleships, carriers, cruisers, and some destroyers) were retained and refitted for service. The increasingly powerful United States Navy took on the former role of the Royal Navy as global naval power and police force of the sea. The combination of the threat of the Soviet Union, and Britain's commitments throughout the world, created a new role for the Navy. Governments since the Second World War have had to balance commitments with increasing budgetary pressures, partly due to the increasing cost of weapons systems, what historian [[Paul Kennedy]] called the [[Upward Spiral]].<ref>Kennedy, 1989, pp. 570\u2013571.</ref>\n\nThese pressures were exacerbated by bitter inter-service rivalry.

At the beginning of the 1980s, the Royal Navy was a force focused on blue-water anti-submarine warfare. Its purpose was to search for and destroy Soviet submarines in the North Atlantic, and to operate the nuclear deterrent submarine force. For a time ''Hermes'' was retained, along with all three of the ''Invincible''-class light aircraft carriers. More Sea Harriers were ordered; not just to replace losses, but to also increase the size of the [[Fleet Air Arm]]. New and more capable ships were built; notably the [[Type 42 destroyer|''Sheffield''-class destroyers]], the [[Type 21 frigate|Type 21]], [[Type 22 frigate|Type 22]], and [[Type 23 frigate|Type 23]] [[frigate]]s, new LPDs of the {{sclass-|Albion|landing platform dock|4}}, and {{HMS|Ocean|L12|6}}, but never in the numbers of the ships that they replaced. As a result, the Royal Navy surface fleet continues to reduce in size. A 2013 report found that the current RN was already too small, and that Britain would have to depend on her allies if her territories were attacked.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/385142/Royal-Navy-is-now-too-small-to-protect-Britain|title=Royal Navy is now 'too small' to protect Britain.|author=John Ingham|work=Express|accessdate=23 November 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141023222150/http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/385142/Royal-Navy-is-now-too-small-to-protect-Britain|archive-date=23 October 2014|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe Royal Navy also took part in the [[Gulf War]], the [[Kosovo conflict]], the [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|Afghanistan Campaign]], and the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], the last of which saw RN warships [[Naval Gunfire Support|bombard]] positions in support of the [[Al Faw Peninsula]] landings by [[Royal Marines]]. In August 2005, the Royal Navy rescued seven Russians stranded in a submarine off the [[Kamchatka peninsula]]. The Navy's [[Scorpio 45]] remote-controlled mini-sub freed the Russian submarine from the fishing nets and cables that had held it for three days.

The Harrier aircraft were retired with some being presented to museums and the rest being sold to the United States for spare parts to keep their aircraft flying. The carrier ''Ark Royal'' and the remaining Type 22 frigates were all removed from service and sold for scrap. {{HMS|Illustrious|R06|6}} however, was retained through to 2014 in the [[Landing Platform Helicopter|LPH]] role, until ''Ocean'' completed her refit.

Names are allocated to ships and submarines by a naming committee within the MOD and given by class, with the names of ships within a class often being thematic (for example, the [[Type 23 frigate|Type 23s]] are named after [[Duke#United Kingdom|British dukes]]) or traditional (for example, the {{sclass-|Invincible|aircraft carrier|1}}s all carry the names of famous historic ships). Names are frequently re-used, offering a new ship the rich heritage, battle honours and traditions of her predecessors. Often, a particular vessel class will be named after the first ship of that type to be built. As well as a name, each ship and submarine of the Royal Navy and the Royal Fleet Auxiliary is given a [[pennant number]] which in part denotes its role. For example, the destroyer {{HMS|Daring|D32|}} displays the pennant number 'D32'.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/The-Fleet/Ships/Destroyers/Type-45-Destroyers/HMS-Daring |title=HMS Daring |publisher=Royal Navy |accessdate=15 September 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120913114641/http://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/The-Fleet/Ships/Destroyers/Type-45-Destroyers/HMS-Daring |archive-date=13 September 2012 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n==Ranks, rates, and Insignia==\n{{See also|Royal Navy officer rank insignia|Royal Navy ratings rank insignia}}\nThe Royal Navy ranks, rates and insignia form part of the uniform of the Royal Navy.

Although warships were used by the English kings from the early medieval period, the first major maritime engagements were fought in the [[Hundred Years' War]] against the [[Kingdom of France]]. The modern Royal Navy traces its origins to the early 16th century; the oldest of the UK's armed services, it is known as the '''Senior Service'''.\n\nFrom the middle decades of the 17th century, and through the 18th century, the Royal Navy vied with the [[Dutch Navy]] and later with the [[French Navy]] for maritime supremacy. From the mid 18th century, it was the world's most powerful navy until the [[Second World War]]. The Royal Navy played a key part in establishing the [[British Empire]] as the [[superpower|unmatched world power]] during the 19th and first part of the 20th centuries. Due to this historical prominence, it is common, even among non-Britons, to refer to it as \"the Royal Navy\" without qualification.\n\nFollowing [[World War I]], the Royal Navy was significantly reduced in size,<ref>Rose, ''Power at Sea'', p. 36</ref> although at the onset of [[World War II]] it was still the world's largest. During the [[Cold War]], the Royal Navy transformed into a primarily [[Anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine force]], hunting for [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] submarines and mostly active in the [[GIUK gap]]. Following the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union|collapse of the Soviet Union]], its focus has returned to [[Expeditionary warfare|expeditionary]] operations [[Standing Royal Navy deployments|around the world]] and it remains one of the world's foremost [[blue-water navy|blue-water navies]].<ref>Hyde-Price, ''European Security'', pp. 105\u2013106.</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=The Royal Navy: Britain\u2019s Trident for a Global Agenda |date=4 November 2006 |url=http://henryjacksonsociety.org/2006/11/04/the-royal-navy-britains-trident-for-a-global-agenda/ |publisher=[[Henry Jackson Society]] |accessdate=4 November 2006 |quote=Britannia, with her shield and trident, is the very symbol, not only of the Royal Navy, but also of British global power.

There is no evidence that William adopted or kept the Anglo-Saxon ship mustering system, known as the ''scipfryd.'' Hardly noted after 1066, it appears that the Normans let the ''scipfryd'' languish so that by 1086, when the [[Doomsday Book]] was completed, it had apparently ceased to exist.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Safeguard of the Sea, A Naval History of Britain 660\u20131649|last=Roger|first=N.|publisher=HarperCollins Publishers Ltd.|year=1997|isbn=|location=London|pages=38\u201339}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', in 1068, [[Harold Godwinson]]'s sons [[Godwin, son of Harold Godwinson|Godwine]] and [[Edmund, son of Harold Godwinson|Edmund]] conducted a \"raiding-ship army\" which came from Ireland, raiding across the region and to the townships of [[Bristol]] and [[Somerset]]. In the following year of 1069, they returned with a bigger fleet which they sailed up the River Taw before being beaten back by a local earl near [[Devon]]. However, this made explicitly clear that the newly conquered England under Norman rule, in effect, ceded the Irish Sea to the Irish, the Vikings of Dublin, and other Norwegians.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Medieval Maritime Wartime|last=Stanton|first=Charles|publisher=Pen & Sword Maritime|year=2015|isbn=|location=South Yorkshire|pages=225\u2013226}}</ref> Besides ceding away the Irish Sea, the Normans also ceded the North Sea, a major area where Nordic peoples traveled. In 1069, this lack of naval presence in the North Sea allowed for the invasion and ravaging of England by Jarl Osborn (brother of [[Sweyn II of Denmark|King Svein Estridsson]]) and his sons [[Harald III of Denmark|Harald]], [[Canute IV of Denmark|Cnut]], and Bjorn. In addition to the ravaging of the English townships of [[Dover]], [[Sandwich, Kent|Sandwich]], [[Ipswich]], and [[Norwich]], the Danes connected with the ''aetheling'' (Anglo-Saxon Heir to the crown) Edgar and rebels in Northumbria. William chased Edgar and the rebels to Scotland, but could not defeat the Danes, causing him to resort to the old Anglo-Saxon practice of paying them off.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Anglo-Saxon Chronicle|last=Michael|first=Swanton|publisher=|year=1069|isbn=|location=London|pages=202\u2013204}}</ref>\n\nThough William the Conqueror caused a massive decline in English naval practices, he did occasionally assemble small fleets of ships, but only for limited activities. Most of these limited actions also did not involve direct combat at sea. An example of this was when the rebellious Anglo-Saxon [[Morcar|Earl Morcar]] and his ally Bishop [[\u00c6thelwine (bishop of Durham)|\u00c6thelwine]] of Durham sought refuge on the [[Isle of Ely]] in 1071. According to [[Florence of Worcester]] reported, \"The king [William the Conqueror] hearing of this, blocked up every outlet on the eastern side by means of boatmen [butescarls], and caused a bridge two miles long to be constructed on the western side.\" The ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' also confirms these events. Though William used ships for blockading purposes and for important strategic engagements, his infrequent use of an established navy promoted a damaging practice of infrequent maritime operations, which his successors would practice on frequent basis.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Medieval Maritime Warfare|last=Stanton|first=Charles|publisher=Pen & Sword Maritime|year=2015|isbn=|location=South Yorkshire|page=226}}</ref>\n\nMedieval fleets, in England as elsewhere, were almost entirely composed of merchant ships enlisted into naval service in time of war. From time to time a few \"king's ships\" owned by the monarch were built for specifically warlike purposes; but, unlike some European states, England did not maintain a small permanent core of warships in peacetime. England's naval organisation was haphazard and the mobilization of fleets when war broke out was slow.<ref>Rodger, ''Safeguard'', pp. 52\u201353, 117\u2013130.</ref>\n\n=====Barons' Revolt and the evolving English Navy, 1215\u20131217=====\nWhen [[John, King of England|King John]]\u2019s campaign to recover Normandy from the French was at a breaking-point, the northern barons of England began to rise in revolt. Forced by the insurrection, John signed the [[Magna Carta]] on 15 June 1215, in hopes of satisfying the barons to buy time for [[Pope Innocent III]] to excommunicate the rebellious barons and condemn the Magna Carta. From this, the barons revolted, commencing the [[First Barons' War]] with the capture of [[Rochester Castle]]. Grasping, however, that they (the barons) were outmatched by royalists and King John, the barons decided to turn to France for assistance. Realizing the baron's intentions, John attempted to assemble a Navy, to prevent the arrival of the French.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Flowers of History|author=Roger of Wendover|author-link=Roger of Wendover|translator-last=Giles|translator-first=J.

Bohn Publishing|year=1849|isbn=|location=London|pages=308, 329, 334\u2013339, 340\u2013341}}</ref> France, who saw this as a fortunate opportunity, decided to assist the barons, with [[Philip II of France|Phillip II]]'s (King of France) son [[Louis VIII of France|Dauphin Louis]], later known as Louis VIII of France, to invade England. With John unable to swiftly build up his navy, due to the adopting of infrequent maritime operations from William the Conqueror, the French Navy under Louis invaded and landed at Sandwich unopposed in April 1216.<ref name=\":0\" /> With Louis near London, John fled to [[Winchester]], where he would stay until his death on 19 October 1216, having his nine-year-old son [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] as heir to the throne.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Historie des Dues de Normandie et des Rois d'Angleterre|last=Michel|first=F.|publisher=|year=1840|isbn=|location=Paris|pages=172\u2013177}}</ref>\n\nParadoxically, John's death turned the tide against Louis, the rebellion in England, and the development of the English navy. [[William Marshal, 1st Earl of Pembroke]], who became regent to the son of the recently deceased English king, began to regain the loyalties to the royalist cause through a regimen of compromise. Among these were the [[Cinque Ports]], who had substantial amounts of maritime ships. With the English now having substantial amount of vessels, Louis returned to France to gather reinforcements and more maritime vessels. Though he succeeded, English vessels began to [[blockade]] and harass French shipping, trade, and blockaded multiple French-controlled English ports.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Historie des Ducs de Normandie|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=183\u2013185}}</ref>\n\nBy mid-1217, English royalists began to gain the advantage over the rebellious Barons and their French allies. Again needing more troops, Louis requested from his wife [[Blanche of Castile]] to assemble more troops for him. Up to the task, Blanche assisted in gathering forces for her husband, with a massive French force being assembled by August 1217, at the port of Calais. At the head of the French transports was [[Eustace the Monk]], Louis\u2019 best naval commander, who had helped Louis escape many English blockade, such as the one in Winchelsea&nbsp; in January 1217.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Medieval Maritime Warfare|last=Stanton|first=Charles|publisher=Pen & Sword Maritime|year=2015|isbn=|location=|page=232}}</ref>\n\nThe subsequent encounter between the two fleets came in the Downs off Sandwich, known as the [[Battle of Sandwich (1217)|Battle of Sandwich]].

The battle was dominated by the English, with French losing almost all of their ships, including Eustace the Monk who was killed in the action that took place. With the death of Eustace the Monk and the defeat of the French at Sandwich, William Marshal was able to isolate Louis in London, compelling him to renounce his claim to the English throne and force him to return to France.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Historie des Ducs de Normandie|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=198\u2013205}}</ref>\n\n=====Scottish and English Navies, 1249\u20131318===== \nThere are mentions in medieval records of fleets commanded by Scottish kings including [[William the Lion]]<ref name=\"Tytler1829pp309-10\">P.

In the 1690s, two separate schemes for larger naval forces were put in motion. As usual, the larger part was played by the merchant community rather than the government. The first was the [[Darien Scheme]] to found a Scottish colony in Spanish controlled America. It was undertaken by the [[Company of Scotland]], who created a fleet of five ships, including ''Caledonia'' and ''St. Andrew'', all built or chartered in Holland and Hamburg.

Amphibious operations by the Anglo-Dutch fleet brought about the capture of [[Sardinia]], the [[Balearic Islands]] and a number of Spanish mainland ports, most importantly [[Barcelona]]. While most of these gains were turned over to the Habsburgs, Britain held on to [[Gibraltar]] and [[Menorca]], which were retained in the peace settlement, providing the Navy with Mediterranean bases. Early in the war French naval squadrons had done considerable damage to English and Dutch commercial convoys. However, a major victory over France and Spain at [[Battle of Vigo Bay|Vigo Bay]] (1702), further successes in battle, and the scuttling of the entire French Mediterranean fleet at [[Toulon]] in 1707 virtually cleared the Navy's opponents from the seas for the latter part of the war.

The war saw a series of inconclusive battles in the Atlantic and Caribbean, in which the Navy failed to achieve the decisive victories needed to secure the supply lines of British forces in North America and to cut off the colonial rebels from outside support.<ref>Rodger, ''Command'', pp. 330\u2013351.</ref> The most important operation of the war came in 1781 when, in the [[Battle of the Chesapeake]], the British fleet failed to lift the French blockade of Lord Cornwallis's army, resulting in Cornwallis's surrender at [[Battle of Yorktown (1781)|Yorktown]].<ref>Rodger, ''Command'', pp. 351\u2013352.</ref> Although this disaster effectively concluded the fighting in North America, hostilities continued in the Indian Ocean, where the French were prevented from re-establishing a meaningful foothold in India, and in the Caribbean.

Despite having to completely replace its war fleet, the Navy managed to maintain its overwhelming advantage over all potential rivals.

The Navy's [[Northern Patrol]] closed off access to the [[North Sea]], while the [[Dover Patrol]] closed off access to the [[English Channel]]. The Navy also mined the North Sea. As well as closing off the Imperial German Navy's access to the Atlantic, the blockade largely blocked neutral merchant shipping heading to or from [[German Empire|Germany]]. The blockade was maintained during the eight months after the armistice was agreed to force Germany to end the war and sign the [[Treaty of Versailles]].<ref>Osbourne, Eric W. (2004).

For much of the war this submarine campaign was restricted by [[prize rules]] requiring merchant ships to be warned and evacuated before sinking. In 1915, the Germans renounced these restrictions and began to sink merchant ships on sight, but later returned to the previous [[rules of engagement]] to placate neutral opinion. A resumption of unrestricted submarine warfare in 1917 raised the prospect of Britain and its allies being starved into submission. The Navy's response to this new form of warfare had proved inadequate due to its refusal to adopt a [[convoy]] system for merchant shipping, despite the demonstrated effectiveness of the technique in protecting troop ships. The belated introduction of convoys sharply reduced losses and brought the U-boat threat under control.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/british-naval-convoy-system-introduced|title=British naval convoy system introduced|publisher=History|accessdate=30 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171231051642/http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/british-naval-convoy-system-introduced|archive-date=31 December 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n[[File:HMS Ark Royal h85716.jpg|thumb|{{HMS|Ark Royal|91|6}}]]\nIn the inter-war period, the Royal Navy was stripped of much of its power.

In addition to new construction, several existing old battleships (whose gun power offset to a significant extent the weakly armed new battleships), battlecruisers and heavy cruisers were reconstructed, and anti-aircraft weaponry reinforced, while new technologies, such as [[ASDIC]], [[Huff-Duff]] and [[hydrophones]], were developed. The Navy had lost control of naval aviation when the [[Royal Naval Air Service]] was merged with the [[Royal Flying Corps]] to form the [[Royal Air Force]] in 1918, but regained control of ship-board aircraft with the return of the [[Fleet Air Arm]] to Naval control in 1937.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fleetairarmoa.org/pages/fleet_air_arm_history/history.shtml |title=The History of the Fleet Air Arm Officers Association, FAAOA |work=fleetairarmoa.org |accessdate=8 June 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120418115613/http://www.fleetairarmoa.org/pages/fleet_air_arm_history/history.shtml |archive-date=18 April 2012 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n===1939\u20131945===\n{{Main|Naval history of World War II}}\n[[File:HM King George VI greeting the Flag Officers of the Home Fleet on board the flagship HMS DUKE OF YORK at Scapa Flow, 16 August 1943.

A traditional convoy system was instituted from the start of the war, but German submarine tactics, based on group attacks by \"[[Wolfpack (naval tactic)|wolf-packs]]\", were much more effective than in the previous war, and the threat remained serious for well over three years. Defences were strengthened by deployment of purpose-built escorts, of [[escort carrier]]s, of long-range patrol aircraft, improved anti-submarine weapons and sensors, and by the deciphering of German signals by the code-breakers of [[Bletchley Park]]. The threat was at last effectively broken by devastating losses inflicted on the U-boats in the spring of 1943. Intense convoy battles of a different sort, against combined air, surface and submarine threats, were fought off enemy-controlled coasts in [[Arctic convoys of World War II|the Arctic]], where Britain ran supply convoys through to Russia, and in the Mediterranean, where the struggle focused on [[Malta convoys|Convoys to Malta]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.melbournestar.co.uk/Operation_Pedestal.html|title=Operation Pedestal|publisher=Melbourne Star|accessdate=30 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171223001713/http://www.melbournestar.co.uk/Operation_Pedestal.html|archive-date=23 December 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe Navy was also vital in guarding the sea lanes that enabled British forces to fight in North Africa, the Mediterranean and the Far East.

All of the pre-war ships (except for the {{sclass2-|Town|cruiser|0||1936}} light cruisers) were quickly retired and most sold for scrapping over the years 1945\u20131948, and only the best condition ships (the four surviving ''King George V''-class battleships, carriers, cruisers, and some destroyers) were retained and refitted for service. The increasingly powerful United States Navy took on the former role of the Royal Navy as global naval power and police force of the sea. The combination of the threat of the Soviet Union, and Britain's commitments throughout the world, created a new role for the Navy. Governments since the Second World War have had to balance commitments with increasing budgetary pressures, partly due to the increasing cost of weapons systems, what historian [[Paul Kennedy]] called the [[Upward Spiral]].<ref>Kennedy, 1989, pp. 570\u2013571.</ref>\n\nThese pressures were exacerbated by bitter inter-service rivalry.

A plan was drawn up for three large aircraft carriers, each displacing about 60,000&nbsp;tons; the plan was designated [[CVA-01]]. These carriers would be able to operate the latest aircraft coming into service and keep the Royal Navy's place as a major naval power. The new [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] government that came to power in 1964 was determined to cut defence expenditure as a means to reduce public spending, and in the [[1966 Defence White Paper]] the project was cancelled.<ref>Eric J.

At the beginning of the 1980s, the Royal Navy was a force focused on blue-water anti-submarine warfare. Its purpose was to search for and destroy Soviet submarines in the North Atlantic, and to operate the nuclear deterrent submarine force. For a time ''Hermes'' was retained, along with all three of the ''Invincible''-class light aircraft carriers. More Sea Harriers were ordered; not just to replace losses, but to also increase the size of the [[Fleet Air Arm]]. New and more capable ships were built; notably the [[Type 42 destroyer|''Sheffield''-class destroyers]], the [[Type 21 frigate|Type 21]], [[Type 22 frigate|Type 22]], and [[Type 23 frigate|Type 23]] [[frigate]]s, new LPDs of the {{sclass-|Albion|landing platform dock|4}}, and {{HMS|Ocean|L12|6}}, but never in the numbers of the ships that they replaced.

Submarines are styled HM Submarine, also abbreviated \"HMS\". Names are allocated to ships and submarines by a naming committee within the MOD and given by class, with the names of ships within a class often being thematic (for example, the [[Type 23 frigate|Type 23s]] are named after [[Duke#United Kingdom|British dukes]]) or traditional (for example, the {{sclass-|Invincible|aircraft carrier|1}}s all carry the names of famous historic ships). Names are frequently re-used, offering a new ship the rich heritage, battle honours and traditions of her predecessors. Often, a particular vessel class will be named after the first ship of that type to be built. As well as a name, each ship and submarine of the Royal Navy and the Royal Fleet Auxiliary is given a [[pennant number]] which in part denotes its role.

Additionally, many liner notes from the band's albums list attorney [[Bertis Downs]] and manager [[Jefferson Holt]] as non-musical members.  One of the first [[alternative rock]] bands, R.E.M. was noted for Buck's ringing, [[arpeggiated]] guitar style, Stipe's distinctive vocal quality, unique stage presence and obscure lyrics, Mills's melodic basslines and backing vocals, and Berry's tight, economical drumming, and backing vocals of his own. In the early 1990s, other [[alternative rock]] acts such as [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] and [[Pavement (band)|Pavement]] viewed R.E.M. as a pioneer of the genre. After Berry left the band in 1997, through some changes in musical style to include [[electronic music]] and [[pop rock]] sounds, the band continued its career in the 2000s with mixed critical and commercial success. The band broke up amicably in 2011 with members devoting time on solo projects despite having sold more than 85 million records worldwide and becoming one of the [[List of best-selling music artists|world's best-selling music artists]].\n\nR.E.M. released its first single, \"[[Radio Free Europe (song)|Radio Free Europe]]\", in 1981 on the independent record label [[Hib-Tone]]. It was followed by the ''[[Chronic Town]]'' [[Extended play|EP]] in 1982, the band's first release on [[I.R.S. Records]]. In 1983, the group released its critically acclaimed debut album, ''[[Murmur (album)|Murmur]]'', and built its reputation over the next few years through subsequent releases each year from 1984 to 1988: ''[[Reckoning (R.E.M. album)|Reckoning]]'', ''[[Fables of the Reconstruction]]'', ''[[Lifes Rich Pageant]]'', ''[[Document (album)|Document]]'' and ''[[Green (R.E.M. album)|Green]]'', including an intermittent b-side compilation ''[[Dead Letter Office (album)|Dead Letter Office]]''. With constant touring, and the support of [[campus radio|college radio]], following years of underground success, R.E.M. achieved a mainstream hit with the 1987 single \"[[The One I Love (R.E.M. song)|The One I Love]]\". The group signed to [[Warner Bros. Records]] in 1988, and began to espouse political and environmental concerns while playing large arenas worldwide.\n\nR.E.M.'s most commercially successful albums, ''[[Out of Time (album)|Out of Time]]'' (1991) and ''[[Automatic for the People]]'' (1992), brought it to the vanguard of alternative rock just as it was becoming mainstream. ''Out of Time'' received seven nominations at the [[34th Annual Grammy Awards]], and lead single \"[[Losing My Religion]]\", was R.E.M.'s highest-charting and best-selling hit. R.E.M.'s 1994 album ''[[Monster (R.E.M. album)|Monster]]'' continued its run of success. The band began its first tour in six years to support the album; the tour was marred by medical emergencies suffered by three of the band members. In 1996, R.E.M. re-signed with Warner Bros. for a reported US$80&nbsp;million, at the time the most expensive recording contract in history. The tour however was productive and the band recorded the following album mostly on soundchecks. The resulting record, ''[[New Adventures in Hi-Fi]]'' (1996) is hailed as the band's last great album and members' favourite one, growing in cult status in the years following its release. Berry left the band the following year, and Stipe, Buck, and Mills continued as a trio.\n\nAfter the electronic experimental direction of ''[[Up (R.E.M. album)|Up]]'' (1998) that was commercially unsuccessful, ''[[Reveal (R.E.M. album)|Reveal]]'' (2001) was referred as \"a conscious return to their classic sound\" which received general acclaim. In 2007, the band was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]], in its first year of eligibility. In order to \"redeem themselves\" after the lukewarm reception of ''[[Around the Sun]]'' (2004), the band released the well-received albums ''[[Accelerate (R.E.M. album)|Accelerate]]'' (2008) and ''[[Collapse into Now]]'' (2011). R.E.M. disbanded amicably in September 2011, with former members having continued with various musical projects, and several live and archival albums have been released.\n\n==History==\n===1980\u20131982: Formation and first releases===\nIn January 1980, [[Peter Buck]] met [[Michael Stipe]] in [[Wuxtry Records]], the Athens record store where Buck worked.

Additionally, many liner notes from the band's albums list attorney [[Bertis Downs]] and manager [[Jefferson Holt]] as non-musical members.  One of the first [[alternative rock]] bands, R.E.M. was noted for Buck's ringing, [[arpeggiated]] guitar style, Stipe's distinctive vocal quality, unique stage presence and obscure lyrics, Mills's melodic basslines and backing vocals, and Berry's tight, economical drumming, and backing vocals of his own. In the early 1990s, other [[alternative rock]] acts such as [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] and [[Pavement (band)|Pavement]] viewed R.E.M. as a pioneer of the genre. After Berry left the band in 1997, through some changes in musical style to include [[electronic music]] and [[pop rock]] sounds, the band continued its career in the 2000s with mixed critical and commercial success. The band broke up amicably in 2011 with members devoting time on solo projects despite having sold more than 85 million records worldwide and becoming one of the [[List of best-selling music artists|world's best-selling music artists]].\n\nR.E.M. released its first single, \"[[Radio Free Europe (song)|Radio Free Europe]]\", in 1981 on the independent record label [[Hib-Tone]]. It was followed by the ''[[Chronic Town]]'' [[Extended play|EP]] in 1982, the band's first release on [[I.R.S. Records]]. In 1983, the group released its critically acclaimed debut album, ''[[Murmur (album)|Murmur]]'', and built its reputation over the next few years through subsequent releases each year from 1984 to 1988: ''[[Reckoning (R.E.M. album)|Reckoning]]'', ''[[Fables of the Reconstruction]]'', ''[[Lifes Rich Pageant]]'', ''[[Document (album)|Document]]'' and ''[[Green (R.E.M. album)|Green]]'', including an intermittent b-side compilation ''[[Dead Letter Office (album)|Dead Letter Office]]''. With constant touring, and the support of [[campus radio|college radio]], following years of underground success, R.E.M. achieved a mainstream hit with the 1987 single \"[[The One I Love (R.E.M. song)|The One I Love]]\". The group signed to [[Warner Bros. Records]] in 1988, and began to espouse political and environmental concerns while playing large arenas worldwide.\n\nR.E.M.'s most commercially successful albums, ''[[Out of Time (album)|Out of Time]]'' (1991) and ''[[Automatic for the People]]'' (1992), brought it to the vanguard of alternative rock just as it was becoming mainstream. ''Out of Time'' received seven nominations at the [[34th Annual Grammy Awards]], and lead single \"[[Losing My Religion]]\", was R.E.M.'s highest-charting and best-selling hit. R.E.M.'s 1994 album ''[[Monster (R.E.M. album)|Monster]]'' continued its run of success. The band began its first tour in six years to support the album; the tour was marred by medical emergencies suffered by three of the band members. In 1996, R.E.M. re-signed with Warner Bros. for a reported US$80&nbsp;million, at the time the most expensive recording contract in history. The tour however was productive and the band recorded the following album mostly on soundchecks. The resulting record, ''[[New Adventures in Hi-Fi]]'' (1996) is hailed as the band's last great album and members' favourite one, growing in cult status in the years following its release. Berry left the band the following year, and Stipe, Buck, and Mills continued as a trio.\n\nAfter the electronic experimental direction of ''[[Up (R.E.M. album)|Up]]'' (1998) that was commercially unsuccessful, ''[[Reveal (R.E.M. album)|Reveal]]'' (2001) was referred as \"a conscious return to their classic sound\" which received general acclaim. In 2007, the band was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]], in its first year of eligibility. In order to \"redeem themselves\" after the lukewarm reception of ''[[Around the Sun]]'' (2004), the band released the well-received albums ''[[Accelerate (R.E.M. album)|Accelerate]]'' (2008) and ''[[Collapse into Now]]'' (2011). R.E.M. disbanded amicably in September 2011, with former members having continued with various musical projects, and several live and archival albums have been released.\n\n==History==\n===1980\u20131982: Formation and first releases===\nIn January 1980, [[Peter Buck]] met [[Michael Stipe]] in [[Wuxtry Records]], the Athens record store where Buck worked. The pair discovered that they shared similar tastes in music, particularly in [[punk rock]] and [[protopunk]] artists like [[Patti Smith]], [[Television (band)|Television]], and [[the Velvet Underground]].

This created a need for more systematic architectural education, and the absence of such opportunities caused many aspiring Canadian architects to study in the United States, where ten architecture schools had already been established.<ref name=History /> Canada did not yet have any formal architectural education, and the only forms of architectural education in Montreal were periodical lectures by local practising architects at McGill's affiliated religious colleges. This new need for architectural education is an important factor that led to the founding of the School of Architecture at McGill University.<ref name=Beginning>{{cite web|url=https://www.mcgill.ca/architecture/school/history/beginning|title=The beginning with Stewart H.

Macdonald]] created a chair in architecture at McGill which was led by [[Stewart Henbest Capper]]. At this time, the School offered a four-year course to prepare students for professional accreditation. The first graduating class was composed of three students: George Taylor Hyde, Norman M. McLeod and Frank Peder. Professor Capper gave all lectures in architecture, and Henry F. Armstrong, the only other full-time professor, taught art classes and modelling.<ref name=Beginning />\n\nThe second director of the School, [[Percy Nobbs]], arrived at McGill in 1903 to only two students: Gordon H. Blackader and H.&nbsp;E. Shorey. He divided the four-year course into two streams, the B.Arch. degree and the B.Sc. degree in Architectural Engineering. Three new staff were hired in 1906, and three years later, [[Philip J.

In 1945, a new five-year program was adopted for the next two decades. After the [[World War Two|war]], the School of Architecture increased its staff and doubled its physical accommodation due to the surge in university enrollment. This required the School to briefly use McGill's [[Dawson College]], a [[satellite campus]] in St. Jean, Quebec, to accommodate its students. By 1947, the School had become so cramped that a former Victorian residential building on University Street was vacated to make room for the School's students.<ref name=McGillForties />\n\nAround this time, Professor Frederic Lasserre of McGill's School of Architecture left the university to establish a new School of Architecture at the [[University of British Columbia]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://sala.ubc.ca/about/history|title=History|publisher=University of British Columbia School of Architecture + Landscape Architecture|accessdate=27 March 2020}}</ref> and invited McGill Architecture graduates [[Catherine Mary Wisnicki]], [[Peter Oberlander]] and [[Arthur Erickson]] to teach at his new school. \n\nIn 1946, [[Harold Spence-Sales]] was appointed Associate Professor of Design.

The building is one of the many donations made by [[William Christopher Macdonald|Sir William Macdonald]] and was designed by Sir Andrew Taylor to accommodate the Departments of Chemistry and Mining in 1896. The building was renovated for architecture and urban planning students by architects [[Arcop]] in 1987.<ref name=CAC />\n\nIn 1989, the PhD in Architecture was introduced as an ''ad hoc'' program.

This created a need for more systematic architectural education, and the absence of such opportunities caused many aspiring Canadian architects to study in the United States, where ten architecture schools had already been established.<ref name=History /> Canada did not yet have any formal architectural education, and the only forms of architectural education in Montreal were periodical lectures by local practising architects at McGill's affiliated religious colleges. This new need for architectural education is an important factor that led to the founding of the School of Architecture at McGill University.<ref name=Beginning>{{cite web|url=https://www.mcgill.ca/architecture/school/history/beginning|title=The beginning with Stewart H.

At this time, the School offered a four-year course to prepare students for professional accreditation. The first graduating class was composed of three students: George Taylor Hyde, Norman M.

This required the School to briefly use McGill's [[Dawson College]], a [[satellite campus]] in St. Jean, Quebec, to accommodate its students. By 1947, the School had become so cramped that a former Victorian residential building on University Street was vacated to make room for the School's students.<ref name=McGillForties />\n\nAround this time, Professor Frederic Lasserre of McGill's School of Architecture left the university to establish a new School of Architecture at the [[University of British Columbia]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://sala.ubc.ca/about/history|title=History|publisher=University of British Columbia School of Architecture + Landscape Architecture|accessdate=27 March 2020}}</ref> and invited McGill Architecture graduates [[Catherine Mary Wisnicki]], [[Peter Oberlander]] and [[Arthur Erickson]] to teach at his new school. \n\nIn 1946, [[Harold Spence-Sales]] was appointed Associate Professor of Design.

GASA is known to hold \"Late Night\" events on Thursdays, popular among students from all programs in the School.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.mcgill.ca/engage/overview/faculty-and-school-associations/graduate-faculty-and-school-associations|title=Graduate Faculty and School Associations, Engage McGill|accessdate=18 January 2020}}</ref>\n\n===American Institute of Architecture Students (AIAS)===\nAs of 2019, the School of Architecture has established a chapter of the [[American Institute of Architecture Students]], an international, non-profit, student-run organization dedicated to providing progressive programs, information and resources on critical issues to architecture students.<ref> {{cite web|url=http://www.aias.org/chapter/mcgill-university/|title=McGill University, Northeast Quad|publisher=American Institute of Architecture Students/accessdate=9 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Exchange and Study Abroad===\nThe Peter Guo-hua Fu School of Architecture has close ties to several architecture schools across the world and has formal bilateral exchange agreements on a departmental level with seven schools in particular, including [[The Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts]] in [[Copenhagen]], [[Politecnico di Milano]] in [[Milan]], [[Tongji University]] in [[Shanghai]], [[\u00c9cole Nationale Sup\u00e9rieure d'Architecture de Paris-Belleville]], [[:fr:\u00c9cole nationale sup\u00e9rieure d'architecture de Grenoble|\u00c9cole nationale sup\u00e9rieure d'architecture de Grenoble]], [[Universit\u00e9 catholique de Louvain]] in [[Brussels]] and [[TU Wien]] in [[Vienna]]. These bilateral agreements make it easy for undergraduate architecture students at McGill to go on exchange.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mcgill.ca/architecture/files/architecture/bscarch_programadvisingandcourseregistration-fall_2018.pdf|title=B.Sc.(Arch.) program and Architecture Exchange Students (New and Returning Students) - STUDENT EXCHANGES|page=5|publisher=McGill University|accessdate=27 March 2020}}</ref> \n\nStudents also have the opportunity to spend an exchange semester abroad at any of McGill University's 160+ partner institutions<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mcgill.ca/mcgillabroad/mcgill-students-going-abroad/global-learning-opportunities|title=McGill students going abroad|publisher=McGill Abroad, McGill University|accessdate=27 March 2020}}</ref> as long as they offer architecture exchanges, however these are more difficult to coordinate due to the competitive nature of University-wide exchanges. In addition to the seven schools with whom the School of Architecture has bilateral agreements, architecture students have spent exchange semesters at some of the top architecture schools in the world, including [[The Bartlett]] at [[University College London (UCL)]], [[National University of Singapore]], [[University of Leeds]], [[University of Liverpool]], [[University of Sheffield]] and [[Australian National University]].\n\n==Academics==\nThe School of Architecture offers a professional program in Architecture comprising a Bachelor of Science in Architecture (BSc[Arch]) and professional Master of Architecture (MArch) degree, as well as post-professional graduate programs leading to a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) and post-professional Master of Architecture (MArch) degree. The School has a reputation for excellence in teaching, with all of its professors being either practicing architects or holding professional degrees and/or PhDs,<ref name=Faculty /> and architecture professors often being awarded teaching awards proportionately more often than other departments within the Faculty of Engineering relative to their respective sizes.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mcgill.ca/engineering/faculty-staff/teaching-research-and-service-awards|title=Teaching, Research & Service Awards, Faculty of Engineering|accessdate=8 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Professional programs===\n* '''BSc(Arch)''' \u2013 3 years, 100 credits\n* '''MArch (Professional)''':\n** Design Studio \u2013 1.5 years, 45 credits, or\n** Design Studio (Directed Research) \u2013 2 years, 60 credits\n\nThe MArch (Professional) degree is accredited by the [[Professional requirements for architects#Canada|Canadian Architectural Certification Board]] (CACB), and is recognized by the [[National Council of Architectural Registration Boards]] (NCARB) in the United States.<ref name=Accreditation />\n\n===Post-professional research programs===\n* '''MArch (Non-Thesis)''':\n** Architectural History and Theory \u2013 45 credits\n** Urban Design and Housing \u2013 45 credits\n* '''PhD'''\n<ref name=Programs />\n\n===Admissions===\nThe McGill School of Architecture has the smallest entering class per degree offered of any architecture school in Canada. With a maximum capacity of 50 undergraduate students in the first year undergraduate studio (BSc[Arch]) and 35 students in both of the Master's (MArch&nbsp;1 and MArch&nbsp;II) studios, the School has one of the most selective and competitive sets of program offerings in the country with one of the lowest overall application-to-acceptance ratios.<ref name=Stats /> \n\nGenerally, about 5\u201310 students from outside Quebec who plan to study architecture for their undergraduate degree will spend their first year at McGill in U0, taking the necessary engineering prerequisites required for the 3-year BSc (Architecture) program at the School of Architecture. Students coming from Quebec [[CEGEP]]s enter directly into the BSc Architecture program, or U1, but are required to have received a [[Diploma of college studies|DEC]] in either pure and applied science or health sciences, as these degrees fulfill the engineering prerequisites for the Architecture program.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mcgill.ca/architecture/programs/professional#application|title=Application procedures|publisher=Peter Guo-hua Fu School of Architecture, McGill University|accessdate=27 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nOffers of acceptance into the program are based on a unique review process including an evaluation of a portfolio of works and extracurricular involvement, in addition to grades. In the 2010\u20132011 academic year, there were 687 applications with portfolios to the undergraduate BSc Architecture program with only 51 spaces, giving an overall applications to enrolments ratio of 7.42%.<ref name=Admissions>{{cite web| url=https://info.publicintelligence.net/McGillSoA-AUR.pdf| title=McGill School of Architecture: 2011 Cyclical Academic Unit Review, p.13 Section 2.0: Academic Programs, Teaching and Learning | year=2011 |accessdate=16 January 2020}}</ref> With the exception of the new Bioengineering degree at McGill, for Quebec [[CEGEP]] students, admissions to the School of Architecture represent the highest average [[R score]] of students accepted into the Faculty of Engineering<ref>{{cite web| url=https://info.publicintelligence.net/McGillSoA-AUR.pdf| title=McGill School of Architecture: 2011 Cyclical Academic Unit Review, p.39 Section 2.7.1 Admissions | year=2011 |accessdate=16 January 2020}}</ref> however in contrast to the high average R score, the lowest score admitted can sometimes be closer to the engineering average due to the importance of the portfolio in the admissions process.\n\nThe School of Architecture has one of the highest percentages of female representation at McGill, with an overall ratio of female-to-male students of approximately 2:1. As of fall&nbsp;2019, there were 119 female and 44 male undergraduate students, and 54 female and 36 male graduate students enrolled at the School. In some studios, the ratio can be as high as 8:1, such as is the case for the undergraduate class of 2021.<ref name=Enrollment />\n\n==Lecture series==\nEach year, the School of Architecture presents public lectures, exhibitions and symposia showcasing leading architects and important figures in the field. These lectures are organized by various individuals and organizations affiliated with the School. Lecture Series include lunchtime \"Brown Bag\" lectures organized by the McGill Architecture Students' Association, evening lectures sponsored by local Montreal firms such as Provencher Roy & [[NEUF Architect(e)s]],<ref name=LectureSeries /> and most notably, the annual [[David Azrieli|David J.
