The new rulers gradually imposed their architecture and enlarged the town.\n\nFrom 343\u2013341 BC in the [[Samnite Wars]], the first Roman army entered the Campanian plain bringing with it the customs and traditions of Rome, and in the Roman [[Latin War]] from 340 BC the Samnites were faithful to Rome. Pompeii, although governed by the Samnites, entered the Roman orbit, to which it remained faithful even during the third Samnite war and in the war against [[Pyrrhus of Epirus|Pyrrhus]]. In the late 4th century BC the city began to expand from its nucleus and into the open walled area. The street plan of the new areas was more regular and more conformal to [[Hippodamus]]'s street plan. The city walls were reinforced in [[Sarno]] stone in the early 3rd century BC (the limestone ''enceinte'', or the \"first Samnite wall\"). It formed the basis for the currently visible walls with an outer wall of rectangular limestone blocks as a terrace wall supporting a large ''[[Agger (ancient Rome)|agger]]'', or earth embankment, behind it.\n\nAfter the [[Samnite Wars]] from 290 BC, Pompeii was forced to accept the status of ''[[socii]]'' of Rome, maintaining, however, linguistic and administrative autonomy.\n\nFrom the outbreak of the [[Second Punic War]] (218\u2013201 BC) in which Pompeii remained faithful to Rome, an additional internal wall was built of [[tufa]] and the internal ''agger'' and outer fa\u00e7ade raised resulting in a double parapet with wider wall-walk.<ref name=\"Etienne-1992\"/> Despite the political uncertainty of these events and the progressive migration of wealthy men to quieter cities in the eastern Mediterranean, Pompeii continued to flourish due to the production and trade of wine and oil with places like [[Provence]] and Spain,<ref>Paul Zanker, ''Pompeii: society, urban images and forms of living'', Turin, Giulio Einaudi Editore, 1993. {{ISBN|88-06-13282-2}} p. 60</ref> as well as to intensive agriculture on farms around the city.\n\nIn the 2nd century BC, Pompeii enriched itself by taking part in Rome's conquest of the east as shown by a statue of Apollo in the Forum erected by [[Lucius Mummius]] in gratitude for their support in the sack of [[Corinth]] and the eastern campaigns. These riches enabled Pompeii to bloom and expand to its ultimate limits. The [[Forum (Roman)|forum]] and many public and private buildings of high architectural quality were built, including the large theatre, the sanctuary to Jupiter, the Basilica, the Comitium, the Stabian Baths and a new two-story portico.<ref>ecolo a.C.\" In Sicilia ellenistica, consuetudo italica.

Many nearby buildings inside the walls were also destroyed.<ref>The World of Pompeii, Edited by John J. Dobbins and Pedar W. Foss, {{ISBN|0-203-86619-3}}, p. 396</ref> Although the battle-hardened troops of the Social League, headed by [[Lucius Cluentius]], helped in resisting the Romans, Pompeii was forced to surrender after the conquest of Nola. \n\nThe result was that Pompeii became a Roman colony with the name of ''Colonia [[Cornelia (gens)|Cornelia]] [[Venus (mythology)|Veneria]] Pompeianorum''. Many of Sulla's veterans were given land and property in and around the city, while many of those who opposed Rome were dispossessed of their property. Despite this, the Pompeians were granted [[Roman citizenship]] and they were quickly assimilated into the Roman world. The main language in the city became Latin,<ref name=\"Pompeii\">{{cite book |last = Beard |first = Mary |title = Pompeii |publisher = Profile Books LTD|isbn = 978-1-86197-596-6|date = 2008}}</ref> and many of Pompeii's old aristocratic families Latinized their names as a sign of assimilation.<ref name=\"Pompeii-The Living City\">{{cite book|last = Butterworth|first = Alex|title = Pompeii \u2013 The Living City|publisher = St Martin's Press; 1st edition|isbn = 978-0-312-35585-2|date = 2005|url = https://archive.org/details/pompeiilivingcit00alex}}</ref> \n\nThe city became an important passage for goods that arrived by sea and had to be sent toward Rome or [[southern Italy]] along the nearby [[Appian Way]]. Many public buildings were built or refurbished and improved under the new order; new buildings included the amphitheatre in 70 BC,   the Forum Baths and the ''theatrum tectum'' while the forum was embellished with the colonnade of Popidius before 80 BC.<ref>The World of Pompeii, Edited by John J. Dobbins and Pedar W. Foss, {{ISBN|0-203-86619-3}}, p. 172</ref> These buildings raised the status of Pompeii as a cultural centre in the region as it outshone its neighbours in the number of places for entertainment which significantly enhanced the social and economic development of the city.\n\nUnder [[Augustus]] from about 30 BC a major expansion in new public buildings, as in the rest of the empire, included the Eumachia building, the Sanctuary of Augustus and the [[Macellum]]. From about 20 BC, Pompeii was fed with running water by a spur from the Serino aqueduct or [[Aqua Augusta (Naples)]] built by [[Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa|Agrippa]].\n\nIn AD 59, there was a serious riot and bloodshed in the amphitheatre between Pompeians and [[Nuceria]]ns (which is recorded in a fresco) and which led the Roman senate to send the [[Praetorian Guard]] to restore order and to ban further events for a period of ten years.<ref>Tacitus: Ann. 14.17</ref><ref>See W.

Chaos followed the earthquake; fires caused by oil lamps that had fallen during the quake added to the panic. The nearby cities of [[Herculaneum]] and [[Nuceria]] were also affected.<ref name=\"archaeology1\"/>\n\nBetween 62 and the eruption in 79 most rebuilding was done in the private sector and older, damaged frescoes were often covered with newer ones, for example. In the public sector the opportunity was taken to improve buildings and the city plan e.g. in the forum.<ref>''The World of Pompeii'', Edited by John J. Dobbins and Pedar W. Foss, {{ISBN|0-203-86619-3}}, p. 173</ref> \n\nAn important field of current research concerns structures that were restored between the earthquake of 62 and the eruption. It was thought until recently that some of the damage had still not been repaired at the time of the eruption but this has been shown to be doubtful as the evidence of missing forum statues and marble wall-veneers are most likely due to robbers after the city's burial.<ref>Dobbins, J.

The new baths took over a whole ''insula'' by demolishing houses, which may have been made easier by the earthquake that had damaged these houses. This shows that the city was still flourishing rather than struggling to recover from the earthquake.<ref>John J. Dobbins, Pedar W.

By evening of the second day, the eruption was over, leaving only haze in the atmosphere through which the sun shone weakly.\n\nA multidisciplinary [[Vulcanology|volcanological]] and [[Biological anthropology|bio-anthropological]] study<ref>{{Harvnb|Mastrolorenzo|Petrone|Pappalardo|Guarino|2010|p=e11127}}.</ref> of the eruption products and victims, merged with numerical simulations and experiments, indicates that at Pompeii and surrounding towns [[heat]] was the main cause of death of people, previously believed to have died by ash [[suffocation]]. The results of the study, published in 2010, show that exposure to at least {{convert|250|C|F|-1}} hot [[pyroclastic flows]] at a distance of {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=off}} from the vent was sufficient to cause instant death, even if people were sheltered within buildings. The people and buildings of Pompeii were covered in up to 12 different layers of [[tephra]], in total up to {{convert|6|m|ft|1}} deep.\n\n[[Pliny the Younger]] provided a first-hand account of the eruption of Mount Vesuvius from his position across the [[Bay of Naples]] at [[Misenum]] but written 25 years after the event. His uncle, [[Pliny the Elder]], with whom he had a close relationship, died while attempting to rescue stranded victims. As admiral of the fleet, Pliny the Elder had ordered the ships of the Imperial Navy stationed at Misenum to cross the bay to assist evacuation attempts. Volcanologists have recognised the importance of Pliny the Younger's account of the eruption by calling similar events \"[[Plinian eruption|Plinian]]\".  It had long been thought that the eruption was an August event based on one version of the letter but another version<ref name=\"Stefani 2006 10\u201314\">{{Harvnb|Stefani|2006|pp=10\u201314}}.</ref> gives a date of the eruption as late as 23 November.

Further eruptions particularly in 471\u2013473 and 512 covered the remains more deeply.\nThe area became known as the ''Civitas'' due to the obstacles in the ground.\n\nThe next known date that any part was unearthed was in 1592, when architect [[Domenico Fontana]] while digging an underground aqueduct ran into ancient walls covered with paintings and inscriptions. He unearthed a few frescoes then covered them over again and nothing more came of the discovery. \n\nIn 1689 during the sinking of well, Francesco Picchetti saw a wall inscription mentioning ''decurio Pompeiis'' ('town councillor of Pompeii') but he associated it with a villa of [[Pompey]]. Franceso Bianchini pointed out the true meaning and he was supported by Giuseppe Macrini who in 1693 excavated some walls and stated that Pompeii lay beneath Civitas in his book \"De Vesuvio\" of 1699.<ref>Colin Amery, Brian Curran, The Lost World of Pompeii,\nGetty Publications, 2002 ISBN:0711225036 p 31</ref> \n\nHerculaneum itself was rediscovered in 1738 by workmen digging for the foundations of a [[summer palace]] for the [[Kingdom of Naples|King of Naples]], [[Charles III of Spain|Charles of Bourbon]].

The land on which Pompeii lies was expropriated and up to 700 workers were used in the excavations. The excavated areas in the north and south were connected. Parts of the Via dell'Abbondanza were also exposed in west\u2013east direction and for the first time an impression of the size and appearance of the ancient town could be appreciated. In the following years, the excavators struggled with lack of money and excavations progressed slowly, but with significant finds such as the houses of the [[House of the Faun|Faun]], of [[Meleager]], the [[House of the Tragic Poet|Tragic Poet]] and the [[Castor and Pollux|Dioscuri]].\n\n[[Giuseppe Fiorelli]] took charge of the excavations in 1863 and made greater progress.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ancient/romans/pompeii_rediscovery_01.shtml#two |title=Pompeii: Its Discovery and Preservation |first=Salvatore Ciro |last=Nappo |date=February 17, 2011 |accessdate=March 2, 2013 |website=BBC |quote=Giuseppe Fiorelli directed the Pompeii excavation from 1863 to 1875 }}</ref> During early excavations of the site, occasional voids in the ash layer had been found that contained human remains. It was Fiorelli who realised these were spaces left by the decomposed bodies and so devised the technique of injecting [[plaster]] into them to recreate the forms of Vesuvius's victims. This technique is still in use today, with a clear [[resin]] now used instead of plaster because it is more durable, and does not destroy the bones, allowing further analysis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pompeionline.net/edifici/regione-i/pompei-orto-dei-fuggiaschi|last=Gracco|first=Tiberio|title=Orto dei Fuggiaschi|website=Pompei Online|date=28 April 2017|accessdate=23 June 2017}}</ref>\n\nFiorelli also introduced scientific documentation. He divided the city into the present nine areas (''regiones'') and blocks (''insulae'') and numbered the entrances of the individual houses (''domus''), so that each is identified by these three numbers. Fiorelli also published the first periodical with excavation reports. Under Fiorelli's successors the entire west of the city was exposed.\n\n===Modern archaeology===\n\nIn the 1920s [[Amedeo Maiuri]] excavated for the first time in older layers than that of 79 AD in order to learn about the settlement history. Maiuri made the last excavations on a grand scale in the 1950s, and the area south of the Via dell'Abbondanza and the city wall was almost completely uncovered, but they were poorly documented scientifically. Preservation was haphazard and presents today's archaeologists with great difficulty. Questionable reconstruction was done in the 1980s and 1990s after the severe earthquake of 1980, which caused great destruction. Since then, except for targeted soundings and excavations, work was confined to the excavated areas. Further excavations on a large scale are not planned and today archaeologists try to reconstruct, to document and, above all, to stop the ever faster decay.\n\nUnder the ''Great Pompeii Project'' over 2.5&nbsp;km of ancient walls are being relieved of danger of collapse by treating the unexcavated areas behind the street fronts in order to increase drainage and reduce the pressure of ground water and earth on the walls, a problem especially in the rainy season. As of August 2019, these excavations have resumed on unexcavated areas of ''Regio V''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://pompeiisites.org/en/press-kit-en/discoveries-continue-at-the-regio-v-site/ |title=Discoveries Continue at the Regio V Site |website=Archaeological Park of Pompeii |access-date=August 20, 2019 |date=2018-08-23 }}</ref>\n\n=== Conservation ===\n{{Main|Conservation issues of Pompeii and Herculaneum}}\n\nObjects buried beneath Pompeii were well-preserved for almost 2,000 years as the lack of air and moisture allowed little to no deterioration. However, once exposed, Pompeii has been subject to both natural and man-made forces, which have rapidly increased deterioration.\n\nWeathering, erosion, light exposure, water damage, poor methods of excavation and reconstruction, introduced plants and animals, tourism, vandalism and theft have all damaged the site in some way. The lack of adequate weather protection of all but the most interesting and important buildings has allowed original interior decoration to fade or be lost. Two-thirds of the city has been excavated, but the remnants of the city are rapidly deteriorating.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/magazine/ashes-to-ashes-the-latter-day-ruin-of-pompeii |last=Popham |first=Peter |title=Ashes to ashes: the latter-day ruin of Pompeii |journal=Prospect Magazine |date=May 2010 |location=London |accessdate=23 June 2017}}</ref>\n\nFurthermore, during [[World War II]] many buildings were badly damaged or destroyed by bombs dropped in several raids by the [[Allies of World War II|Allied forces]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.getty.edu/art/exhibitions/pompeii/destruction.html |title=The Last Days of Pompeii: Destruction in World War II |access-date=August 27, 2019 |website=The J.

Agricultural policymaker [[Columella]] suggested that each vineyard in Rome produced a quota of three [[Ancient Roman units of measurement|cullei]] of wine per [[jugerum]], otherwise the vineyard would be uprooted. The nutrient-rich lands near Pompeii were extremely efficient at this and were often able to exceed these requirements by a steep margin, therefore providing the incentive for local wineries to establish themselves.<ref name=\"Agriculture in Pompeii\"/> While wine was exported for Pompeii's economy, the majority of the other agricultural goods were likely produced in quantities sufficient for the city's consumption.\n\nRemains of large formations of constructed wineries were found in the ''[[Forum Boarium]]'', covered by cemented casts from the eruption of Vesuvius.<ref name=\"Agriculture in Pompeii\"/> It is speculated that these historical vineyards are strikingly similar in structure to the modern day vineyards across Italy.\n\nCarbonised food plant remains, roots, seeds and pollens, have been found from gardens in Pompeii, Herculaneum and from the Roman villa at [[Torre Annunziata]].

It was a wealthy town, enjoying many fine public buildings and luxurious private houses with lavish decorations, furnishings and works of art which were the main attractions for the early excavators.

Graduate School of The University of Texas, p. 56</ref>\n\nThe [[Samnites]], people from the areas of [[Abruzzo]] and [[Molise]], and allies of the Romans, conquered Greek Cumae between 423 and 420 BC and it is likely that all the surrounding territory, including Pompeii, was already conquered around 424 BC. The new rulers gradually imposed their architecture and enlarged the town.\n\nFrom 343\u2013341 BC in the [[Samnite Wars]], the first Roman army entered the Campanian plain bringing with it the customs and traditions of Rome, and in the Roman [[Latin War]] from 340 BC the Samnites were faithful to Rome. Pompeii, although governed by the Samnites, entered the Roman orbit, to which it remained faithful even during the third Samnite war and in the war against [[Pyrrhus of Epirus|Pyrrhus]]. In the late 4th century BC the city began to expand from its nucleus and into the open walled area. The street plan of the new areas was more regular and more conformal to [[Hippodamus]]'s street plan. The city walls were reinforced in [[Sarno]] stone in the early 3rd century BC (the limestone ''enceinte'', or the \"first Samnite wall\"). It formed the basis for the currently visible walls with an outer wall of rectangular limestone blocks as a terrace wall supporting a large ''[[Agger (ancient Rome)|agger]]'', or earth embankment, behind it.\n\nAfter the [[Samnite Wars]] from 290 BC, Pompeii was forced to accept the status of ''[[socii]]'' of Rome, maintaining, however, linguistic and administrative autonomy.\n\nFrom the outbreak of the [[Second Punic War]] (218\u2013201 BC) in which Pompeii remained faithful to Rome, an additional internal wall was built of [[tufa]] and the internal ''agger'' and outer fa\u00e7ade raised resulting in a double parapet with wider wall-walk.<ref name=\"Etienne-1992\"/> Despite the political uncertainty of these events and the progressive migration of wealthy men to quieter cities in the eastern Mediterranean, Pompeii continued to flourish due to the production and trade of wine and oil with places like [[Provence]] and Spain,<ref>Paul Zanker, ''Pompeii: society, urban images and forms of living'', Turin, Giulio Einaudi Editore, 1993. {{ISBN|88-06-13282-2}} p. 60</ref> as well as to intensive agriculture on farms around the city.\n\nIn the 2nd century BC, Pompeii enriched itself by taking part in Rome's conquest of the east as shown by a statue of Apollo in the Forum erected by [[Lucius Mummius]] in gratitude for their support in the sack of [[Corinth]] and the eastern campaigns. These riches enabled Pompeii to bloom and expand to its ultimate limits. The [[Forum (Roman)|forum]] and many public and private buildings of high architectural quality were built, including the large theatre, the sanctuary to Jupiter, the Basilica, the Comitium, the Stabian Baths and a new two-story portico.<ref>ecolo a.C.\" In Sicilia ellenistica, consuetudo italica.

Many nearby buildings inside the walls were also destroyed.<ref>The World of Pompeii, Edited by John J. Dobbins and Pedar W. Foss, {{ISBN|0-203-86619-3}}, p. 396</ref> Although the battle-hardened troops of the Social League, headed by [[Lucius Cluentius]], helped in resisting the Romans, Pompeii was forced to surrender after the conquest of Nola. \n\nThe result was that Pompeii became a Roman colony with the name of ''Colonia [[Cornelia (gens)|Cornelia]] [[Venus (mythology)|Veneria]] Pompeianorum''. Many of Sulla's veterans were given land and property in and around the city, while many of those who opposed Rome were dispossessed of their property. Despite this, the Pompeians were granted [[Roman citizenship]] and they were quickly assimilated into the Roman world. The main language in the city became Latin,<ref name=\"Pompeii\">{{cite book |last = Beard |first = Mary |title = Pompeii |publisher = Profile Books LTD|isbn = 978-1-86197-596-6|date = 2008}}</ref> and many of Pompeii's old aristocratic families Latinized their names as a sign of assimilation.<ref name=\"Pompeii-The Living City\">{{cite book|last = Butterworth|first = Alex|title = Pompeii \u2013 The Living City|publisher = St Martin's Press; 1st edition|isbn = 978-0-312-35585-2|date = 2005|url = https://archive.org/details/pompeiilivingcit00alex}}</ref> \n\nThe city became an important passage for goods that arrived by sea and had to be sent toward Rome or [[southern Italy]] along the nearby [[Appian Way]]. Many public buildings were built or refurbished and improved under the new order; new buildings included the amphitheatre in 70 BC,   the Forum Baths and the ''theatrum tectum'' while the forum was embellished with the colonnade of Popidius before 80 BC.<ref>The World of Pompeii, Edited by John J. Dobbins and Pedar W. Foss, {{ISBN|0-203-86619-3}}, p. 172</ref> These buildings raised the status of Pompeii as a cultural centre in the region as it outshone its neighbours in the number of places for entertainment which significantly enhanced the social and economic development of the city.\n\nUnder [[Augustus]] from about 30 BC a major expansion in new public buildings, as in the rest of the empire, included the Eumachia building, the Sanctuary of Augustus and the [[Macellum]]. From about 20 BC, Pompeii was fed with running water by a spur from the Serino aqueduct or [[Aqua Augusta (Naples)]] built by [[Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa|Agrippa]].\n\nIn AD 59, there was a serious riot and bloodshed in the amphitheatre between Pompeians and [[Nuceria]]ns (which is recorded in a fresco) and which led the Roman senate to send the [[Praetorian Guard]] to restore order and to ban further events for a period of ten years.<ref>Tacitus: Ann. 14.17</ref><ref>See W.

Chaos followed the earthquake; fires caused by oil lamps that had fallen during the quake added to the panic. The nearby cities of [[Herculaneum]] and [[Nuceria]] were also affected.<ref name=\"archaeology1\"/>\n\nBetween 62 and the eruption in 79 most rebuilding was done in the private sector and older, damaged frescoes were often covered with newer ones, for example. In the public sector the opportunity was taken to improve buildings and the city plan e.g. in the forum.<ref>''The World of Pompeii'', Edited by John J. Dobbins and Pedar W. Foss, {{ISBN|0-203-86619-3}}, p. 173</ref> \n\nAn important field of current research concerns structures that were restored between the earthquake of 62 and the eruption. It was thought until recently that some of the damage had still not been repaired at the time of the eruption but this has been shown to be doubtful as the evidence of missing forum statues and marble wall-veneers are most likely due to robbers after the city's burial.<ref>Dobbins, J.

The new baths took over a whole ''insula'' by demolishing houses, which may have been made easier by the earthquake that had damaged these houses. This shows that the city was still flourishing rather than struggling to recover from the earthquake.<ref>John J. Dobbins, Pedar W.

By evening of the second day, the eruption was over, leaving only haze in the atmosphere through which the sun shone weakly.\n\nA multidisciplinary [[Vulcanology|volcanological]] and [[Biological anthropology|bio-anthropological]] study<ref>{{Harvnb|Mastrolorenzo|Petrone|Pappalardo|Guarino|2010|p=e11127}}.</ref> of the eruption products and victims, merged with numerical simulations and experiments, indicates that at Pompeii and surrounding towns [[heat]] was the main cause of death of people, previously believed to have died by ash [[suffocation]]. The results of the study, published in 2010, show that exposure to at least {{convert|250|C|F|-1}} hot [[pyroclastic flows]] at a distance of {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=off}} from the vent was sufficient to cause instant death, even if people were sheltered within buildings. The people and buildings of Pompeii were covered in up to 12 different layers of [[tephra]], in total up to {{convert|6|m|ft|1}} deep.\n\n[[Pliny the Younger]] provided a first-hand account of the eruption of Mount Vesuvius from his position across the [[Bay of Naples]] at [[Misenum]] but written 25 years after the event. His uncle, [[Pliny the Elder]], with whom he had a close relationship, died while attempting to rescue stranded victims. As admiral of the fleet, Pliny the Elder had ordered the ships of the Imperial Navy stationed at Misenum to cross the bay to assist evacuation attempts. Volcanologists have recognised the importance of Pliny the Younger's account of the eruption by calling similar events \"[[Plinian eruption|Plinian]]\".

There is wide evidence of post-eruption disturbance, including holes made through walls. The city was not completely buried, and tops of larger buildings would have been above the ash making it obvious where to dig or salvage building material.<ref>John J. Dobbins, Pedar W.

Further eruptions particularly in 471\u2013473 and 512 covered the remains more deeply.\nThe area became known as the ''Civitas'' due to the obstacles in the ground.\n\nThe next known date that any part was unearthed was in 1592, when architect [[Domenico Fontana]] while digging an underground aqueduct ran into ancient walls covered with paintings and inscriptions. He unearthed a few frescoes then covered them over again and nothing more came of the discovery. \n\nIn 1689 during the sinking of well, Francesco Picchetti saw a wall inscription mentioning ''decurio Pompeiis'' ('town councillor of Pompeii') but he associated it with a villa of [[Pompey]]. Franceso Bianchini pointed out the true meaning and he was supported by Giuseppe Macrini who in 1693 excavated some walls and stated that Pompeii lay beneath Civitas in his book \"De Vesuvio\" of 1699.<ref>Colin Amery, Brian Curran, The Lost World of Pompeii,\nGetty Publications, 2002 ISBN:0711225036 p 31</ref> \n\nHerculaneum itself was rediscovered in 1738 by workmen digging for the foundations of a [[summer palace]] for the [[Kingdom of Naples|King of Naples]], [[Charles III of Spain|Charles of Bourbon]]. Due to the spectacular quality of the finds, the Spanish military engineer [[Rocque Joaquin de Alcubierre]] made excavations to find further remains at the site of Pompeii in 1748, even if the city was not identified.<ref name=\"Ozgenel 2008 13\">{{Harvnb|Ozgenel|2008|p=13}}.</ref> Charles of Bourbon took great interest in the finds, even after leaving to become king of Spain, because the display of antiquities reinforced the political and cultural prestige of Naples.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ozgenel|2008|p=19}}</ref> On August 20, 1763, an inscription ''[...] Rei Publicae Pompeianorum [...]'' was found and the city was identified as Pompeii.<ref>Giuseppe Fiorelli: Pompeianarum Antiquitatum Historia.

The land on which Pompeii lies was expropriated and up to 700 workers were used in the excavations. The excavated areas in the north and south were connected. Parts of the Via dell'Abbondanza were also exposed in west\u2013east direction and for the first time an impression of the size and appearance of the ancient town could be appreciated. In the following years, the excavators struggled with lack of money and excavations progressed slowly, but with significant finds such as the houses of the [[House of the Faun|Faun]], of [[Meleager]], the [[House of the Tragic Poet|Tragic Poet]] and the [[Castor and Pollux|Dioscuri]].\n\n[[Giuseppe Fiorelli]] took charge of the excavations in 1863 and made greater progress.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ancient/romans/pompeii_rediscovery_01.shtml#two |title=Pompeii: Its Discovery and Preservation |first=Salvatore Ciro |last=Nappo |date=February 17, 2011 |accessdate=March 2, 2013 |website=BBC |quote=Giuseppe Fiorelli directed the Pompeii excavation from 1863 to 1875 }}</ref> During early excavations of the site, occasional voids in the ash layer had been found that contained human remains. It was Fiorelli who realised these were spaces left by the decomposed bodies and so devised the technique of injecting [[plaster]] into them to recreate the forms of Vesuvius's victims. This technique is still in use today, with a clear [[resin]] now used instead of plaster because it is more durable, and does not destroy the bones, allowing further analysis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pompeionline.net/edifici/regione-i/pompei-orto-dei-fuggiaschi|last=Gracco|first=Tiberio|title=Orto dei Fuggiaschi|website=Pompei Online|date=28 April 2017|accessdate=23 June 2017}}</ref>\n\nFiorelli also introduced scientific documentation. He divided the city into the present nine areas (''regiones'') and blocks (''insulae'') and numbered the entrances of the individual houses (''domus''), so that each is identified by these three numbers. Fiorelli also published the first periodical with excavation reports. Under Fiorelli's successors the entire west of the city was exposed.\n\n===Modern archaeology===\n\nIn the 1920s [[Amedeo Maiuri]] excavated for the first time in older layers than that of 79 AD in order to learn about the settlement history. Maiuri made the last excavations on a grand scale in the 1950s, and the area south of the Via dell'Abbondanza and the city wall was almost completely uncovered, but they were poorly documented scientifically. Preservation was haphazard and presents today's archaeologists with great difficulty. Questionable reconstruction was done in the 1980s and 1990s after the severe earthquake of 1980, which caused great destruction. Since then, except for targeted soundings and excavations, work was confined to the excavated areas. Further excavations on a large scale are not planned and today archaeologists try to reconstruct, to document and, above all, to stop the ever faster decay.\n\nUnder the ''Great Pompeii Project'' over 2.5&nbsp;km of ancient walls are being relieved of danger of collapse by treating the unexcavated areas behind the street fronts in order to increase drainage and reduce the pressure of ground water and earth on the walls, a problem especially in the rainy season. As of August 2019, these excavations have resumed on unexcavated areas of ''Regio V''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://pompeiisites.org/en/press-kit-en/discoveries-continue-at-the-regio-v-site/ |title=Discoveries Continue at the Regio V Site |website=Archaeological Park of Pompeii |access-date=August 20, 2019 |date=2018-08-23 }}</ref>\n\n=== Conservation ===\n{{Main|Conservation issues of Pompeii and Herculaneum}}\n\nObjects buried beneath Pompeii were well-preserved for almost 2,000 years as the lack of air and moisture allowed little to no deterioration. However, once exposed, Pompeii has been subject to both natural and man-made forces, which have rapidly increased deterioration.\n\nWeathering, erosion, light exposure, water damage, poor methods of excavation and reconstruction, introduced plants and animals, tourism, vandalism and theft have all damaged the site in some way. The lack of adequate weather protection of all but the most interesting and important buildings has allowed original interior decoration to fade or be lost. Two-thirds of the city has been excavated, but the remnants of the city are rapidly deteriorating.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/magazine/ashes-to-ashes-the-latter-day-ruin-of-pompeii |last=Popham |first=Peter |title=Ashes to ashes: the latter-day ruin of Pompeii |journal=Prospect Magazine |date=May 2010 |location=London |accessdate=23 June 2017}}</ref>\n\nFurthermore, during [[World War II]] many buildings were badly damaged or destroyed by bombs dropped in several raids by the [[Allies of World War II|Allied forces]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.getty.edu/art/exhibitions/pompeii/destruction.html |title=The Last Days of Pompeii: Destruction in World War II |access-date=August 27, 2019 |website=The J.

The nutrient-rich lands near Pompeii were extremely efficient at this and were often able to exceed these requirements by a steep margin, therefore providing the incentive for local wineries to establish themselves.<ref name=\"Agriculture in Pompeii\"/> While wine was exported for Pompeii's economy, the majority of the other agricultural goods were likely produced in quantities sufficient for the city's consumption.\n\nRemains of large formations of constructed wineries were found in the ''[[Forum Boarium]]'', covered by cemented casts from the eruption of Vesuvius.<ref name=\"Agriculture in Pompeii\"/> It is speculated that these historical vineyards are strikingly similar in structure to the modern day vineyards across Italy.\n\nCarbonised food plant remains, roots, seeds and pollens, have been found from gardens in Pompeii, Herculaneum and from the Roman villa at [[Torre Annunziata]].

To combat problems associated with tourism, the governing body for Pompeii, the ''Soprintendenza Archaeological di Pompei'', have begun issuing new tickets that allow tourists to visit cities such as [[Herculaneum]] and [[Stabiae]] as well as the ''[[Villa Poppaea]]'', to encourage visitors to see these sites and reduce pressure on Pompeii.\n\nPompeii is a driving force behind the economy of the nearby town of [[Pompei]]. Many residents are employed in the tourism and hospitality industry, serving as taxi or bus drivers, waiters, or hotel staff.{{Citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\nExcavations at the site have generally ceased due to a moratorium imposed by the superintendent of the site, Professor Pietro Giovanni Guzzo.

He is also active in Israel's economic life.\nHe was the Israeli ambassador to the United States in the years 1990\u20131993 and 1998\u20132000, and an active member of the Knesset in the [[Ometz (political party)|Rafi-State List]], and the [[Likud]] party.\n\n==Biography==\nShoval was born in [[Danzig]], [[Free City of Danzig]] (present-day [[Gda\u0144sk]], [[Poland]]), then home to a [[Jewish community of Danzig|large Jewish community]], as the son of a Jewish family originating in Eastern Europe. His father was born in [[Latvia]]. They [[Aliyah|immigrated]] to [[Mandatory Palestine]] in 1938. Shoval attended first the Ben-Yehuda School and then the \"Geula\" high school in [[Tel Aviv]] before obtaining a BA at [[University of California, Berkeley|UC Berkeley]], and an MA at the [[Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies]] in Geneva. \nBetween 1955 and 1957 he was a cadet in the Ministry Foreign Affairs, after which he became involved in finance, twice serving as chairman of the Bankers Association Council.\n\nShoval joined [[David Ben-Gurion]] when he left to found [[Rafi (political party)|Rafi]] in 1965, and then again when Ben-Gurion founded the [[State List]] in 1969. In the [[1969 Israeli legislative election|elections that year]] he narrowly missed out on being elected to the [[Knesset]]; Shoval was placed fifth on the party's list, but it won only four seats. However, when Ben-Gurion resigned from the Knesset in May 1970, Shoval took his place.\n\nShortly before the [[1973 Israeli legislative election|1973 elections]], the State List joined other groups to form the [[Likud]], and Shoval was returned to the Knesset as a Likud MK. Re-elected in 1977, he was responsible for information in Foreign Affairs Ministry as a deputy to Foreign Minister Moshe Dayan and was responsible for the P.R. and information aspects of the 1978 Camp David Conference.

However, when Ben-Gurion resigned from the Knesset in May 1970, Shoval took his place.\n\nShortly before the [[1973 Israeli legislative election|1973 elections]], the State List joined other groups to form the [[Likud]], and Shoval was returned to the Knesset as a Likud MK. Re-elected in 1977, he was responsible for information in Foreign Affairs Ministry as a deputy to Foreign Minister Moshe Dayan and was responsible for the P.R. and information aspects of the 1978 Camp David Conference.

He studied with [[Peter Dreher]] and [[Horst Antes]] end of the 1960s. His works incorporate materials such as [[straw]], [[wiktionary:ash|ash]], [[clay]], lead, and [[shellac]]. The poems of [[Paul Celan]] have played a role in developing Kiefer's themes of German history and the horror of [[the Holocaust]], as have the spiritual concepts of [[Kabbalah]].\n\nIn his entire body of work, Kiefer argues with the past and addresses [[taboo]] and controversial issues from recent history. Themes from [[Nazi Germany|Nazi rule]] are particularly reflected in his work; for instance, the painting \"Margarethe\" (oil and straw on canvas) was inspired by [[Paul Celan]]'s well-known poem \"''[[Todesfuge]]''\" (\"''Death Fugue''\").\n\nHis works are characterised by an unflinching willingness to confront his culture's dark past, and unrealised potential, in works that are often done on a large, confrontational scale well suited to the subjects. It is also characteristic of his work to find signatures and/or names of people of historical importance, legendary figures or historical places. All of these are encoded [[Sigil (magic)|sigils]] through which Kiefer seeks to process the past; this has resulted in his work being linked with the movements ''New Symbolism'' and ''Neo\u2013Expressionism''.<ref name=big>''Big Questions'', [[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian]], September 2006, p. 33</ref>\n\nKiefer has lived and worked in France since 1992.

In his middle years, his inspiration came from literary figures, namely [[Paul Celan]] and [[Ingeborg Bachmann]]. His later works incorporate themes from [[Judeo-Christian]], ancient Egyptian, and Oriental cultures, which he combines with other motifs. [[Cosmogony]] is also a large focus in his works. In all, Kiefer searches for the meaning of existence and \"representation of the incomprehensible and the non-representational.\"<ref>{{Citation|title=Anselm Kiefer|date=2019-04-07|url=https://de.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anselm_Kiefer&oldid=187321705|work=Wikipedia|language=de|access-date=2019-04-22}}</ref>{{Unreliable source?|date=May 2019|certain=y}}\n\n=== Philosophy ===\nKiefer values a \"spiritual connection\" with the materials he works with, \"extracting the spirit that already lives within [them].\"<ref name=\":1\" /> In doing so, he transforms his materials with acid baths and physical blows with sticks and axes, among other processes.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kennedy|first=Pete|date=|title=How I Challenge the Canons With My Four German Ghost Dissenters|url=|journal=Journal of Artists' Books|volume=38|pages=19\u201320|via=Columbia Chicago Center for Book & Paper Arts}}</ref>\n\nHe often chooses materials for their alchemical properties\u2014[[lead]] in particular. Kiefer's initial attraction to lead arose when he had to repair aging pipes in the first house he owned. Eventually, he came to admire its physical and sensory qualities and began to discover more about its connection to [[alchemy]].<ref name=\":1\" /> Physically, Kiefer specifically likes how the metal looks during the heating and melting process when he sees many colors, especially gold, which he associates to the symbolic gold sought by alchemists.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Albano|first=Albert P.|date=1998|title=Reflections on Painting, Alchemy, Nazism: Visiting with Anselm Kiefer|journal=Journal of the American Institute for Conservation|volume=37|issue=3|pages=348\u2013361|doi=10.2307/3179818|issn=0197-1360|jstor=3179818}}</ref>\n\nKiefer's use of straw in his work represents energy. He claims this is due to straw's physical qualities, including the color gold and its release of energy and heat when burned. The resulting ash makes way for new creation, thus echoing the motifs of transformation and the cycle of life.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nKiefer also values the balance between order and chaos in his work, stating, \"[I]f there is too much order, [the piece] is dead; or if there is much chaos, it doesn't cohere.\" In addition, he cares deeply about the space in which his works reside. He states that his works \"lose their power completely\" if put in the wrong spaces. <ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Wright|first=Karen|date=November 2006|title=The Ruins of Barjac: Politics, alchemy, and learning to dance in Anselm Kiefer's world|url=|journal=Modern Painters|volume=|pages=68\u201375|via=}}</ref>\n\n==Work==\n[[Image:Anselm Kieffer - 'Glaube , Hoffnung, Liebe'.JPG|thumb|right|''Faith, Hope, love'' by Anselm Kiefer]]\n===Photography===\nKiefer began his career creating performances and documenting them in photographs titled ''Occupations and Heroische Sinnbilder (Heroic Symbols)''.

He worked with glass, straw, wood and plant parts. The use of these materials meant that his art works became temporary and fragile, as Kiefer himself was well aware; he also wanted to showcase the materials in such a way that they were not disguised and could be represented in their natural form. The fragility of his work contrasts with the stark subject matter in his paintings. This use of familiar materials to express ideas was influenced by Beuys, who used fat and carpet felt in his works. It is also typical of the Neo-Expressionist style.{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\nKiefer returned to the area of his birthplace in 1971. In the years that followed, he incorporated German mythology in particular in his work, and in the next decade he studied the [[Kabbalah]], as well as [[Hermetic Qabalah|Qabalists]] like Robert Fludd.<ref name=\"Rumelin\"/> He went on extended journeys throughout Europe, the USA and the Middle East; the latter two journeys further influenced his work. Besides paintings, Kiefer created sculptures, watercolors, photographs, and woodcuts, using woodcuts in particular to create a repertoire of figures he could reuse repeatedly in all media over the next decades, lending his work its knotty thematic coherence.<ref name=Rumelin>R\u00fcmelin, Christian. \"Anselm Kiefer: Rolling on the River Rhine,\" ''Art in Print'' Vol. 8 No. 1 (May\u2013June 2018).</ref>\n\nThroughout the 1970s and early 1980s, Kiefer made numerous paintings, watercolors, woodcuts, and books on themes interpreted by [[Richard Wagner]] in his four-opera cycle [[Der Ring des Nibelungen]] (The Ring of the Nibelung).<ref>[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/1995.14.14] Anselm Kiefer, ''My Father Pledged Me a Sword'' (1974\u201375), [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], New York</ref> \n\nIn the early 1980s, he created more than thirty paintings, painted photographs, and watercolors that refer in their titles and inscriptions to the Romanian Jewish writer [[Paul Celan]]'s poem \"Todesfuge\" (\"Death Fugue\").<ref>[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/2000.96.7] Anselm Kiefer, ''Your Golden Hair, Margarete'' (1980) Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York</ref>\n\nA series of paintings which Kiefer executed between 1980 and 1983 depict looming stone edifices, referring to famous examples of National Socialist architecture, particularly buildings designed by [[Albert Speer]] and [[Wilhelm Kreis]].

Such works, like ''Heavy Cloud'' (1985), were an indirect response to the controversy in West Germany in the early 1980s about NATO's stationing of tactical nuclear missiles on German soil and the placement of nuclear fuel processing facilities.<ref>[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/1995.14.41] Anselm Kiefer, ''Heavy Cloud'' (1985), Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York</ref>\n\nBy the mid-1980s, Kiefer's themes widened from a focus on [[Germany]]'s role in civilization to the fate of art and culture in general. His work became more sculptural and involved not only national identity and collective memory, but also [[occult]] [[symbol]]ism, [[theology]] and [[mysticism]]. The theme of all the work is the trauma experienced by entire societies, and the continual rebirth and renewal in life. During the 1980s his paintings became more physical, and featured unusual textures and materials.<ref>[[Sue Hubbard]] (24 October 2008), [https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/great-works/margarete-1981-by-anselm-kiefer-saatchi-collection-970630.html] Margarete (1981) by Anselm Kiefer (Saatchi collection). ''The Independent''</ref> The range of his themes broadened to include references to ancient Hebrew and Egyptian history, as in the large painting ''Osiris and Isis'' (1985\u201387). His paintings of the 1990s, in particular, explore the universal myths of existence and meaning rather than those of national identity.<ref>[http://www.christies.com/LotFinder/lot_details.aspx?intObjectID=1992579] Anselm Kiefer: ''Untitled'', 1996 Christie's, 8 February 2001, London</ref> From 1995 to 2001, he produced a cycle of large paintings of the cosmos.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url=http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/collection-online/show-full/bio/?artist_name%3DAnselm+Kiefer%26page%3D1%26f%3DName%26cr%3D1 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-06-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429013316/http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/collection-online/show-full/bio/?artist_name=Anselm%20Kiefer&page=1&f=Name&cr=1 |archivedate=2011-04-29 }} Anselm Kiefer, Guggenheim Collection</ref> He also started to turn to sculpture, although lead still remains his preferred medium.{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\nOver the years Kiefer has made many unusual works, but one work stands out among the rest as particularly bizarre\u2014that work being his 20 Years of Solitude piece. Taking over 20 years to create (1971-1991), 20 Years of Solitude is a ceiling-high stack of hundreds of white-painted ledgers and handmade books, strewn with dirt and dried vegetation, whose pages are stained with the artist\u2019s semen. The word solitude in the title references the artists frequent masturbation onto paper during the 20 years it took to create. He asked American art critic Peter Schjeldahl to write a text for a catalog of the masturbation books. Schjeldahl attempted to oblige but ultimately failed in his endeavor. No other critic would take on the task, so the work has largely faded into obscurity.<ref name=Schjeldahl1998>{{cite web|last=Schjeldahl |first=Peter |title=lost in the terrain: anselm kiefer |date=12 February 1998 |url= http://www.artnet.com/magazine_pre2000/features/schjeldahl/schjeldahl2-12-98.asp |publisher=Artnet}}</ref>\n\nHe would shock the art world yet again at a dinner party in May of 1993. Kiefer and his second wife, Renate Graf, decorated a candlelit commercial loft in New York with white muslin, carpeted the floor with white sand, and staffed it with waiters dressed as mimes with white-face. A handful of art world elite, such as the likes of Sherrie Levine, were served several courses of arcane organ meats, such as pancreas, that were mostly white in color. Not surprisingly, the guests did not find the meal to be particularly appetizing. <ref name=Schjeldahl1998 />\n\nSince 2002, Kiefer has worked with concrete, creating the towers destined for the Pirelli warehouses in Milan, the series of tributes to [[Velimir Khlebnikov]] (paintings of the sea, with boats and an array of leaden objects, 2004-5), a return to the work of [[Paul Celan]]<ref>[http://ropac.net/exhibition/fur-paul-celan-1] Anselm Kiefer, Thaddaeus Ropac</ref> with a series of paintings featuring rune motifs (2004\u20136), and other sculptures.<ref>[http://archive.monumenta.com/2007/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=13&Itemid=9&lang=en]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Anselm Kiefer Biographie, Monumenta 2007, Paris</ref> In 2003, he held his first solo show at Galerie Thaddaeus Ropac, Salzburg Villa Katz, ''[https://www.ropac.net/exhibition/am-anfang Anselm Kiefer: Am Anfang],'' dedicated to a series of new works, centered on the recurring themes of history and myths. In 2005, he held his second exhibition in Galerie Thaddaeus Ropac's Salzburg location, ''[https://www.ropac.net/exhibition/fur-paul-celan F\u00fcr Paul Celan],'' which focused on Kiefer's preoccupation with the book, linking references to Germanic mythology with the poetry of Paul Celan, a German-speaking Jew from Czernowitz. The exhibition featured eleven works on canvas, a series of bound books shown in display cases, and five sculptures, including one powerful, monumental outdoor sculpture of reinforced concrete and lead elements, two leaden piles of books combined with bronze sunflowers, lead ships and wedges, and two monumental leaden books from the series The Secret Life of Plants. The exhibition toured to Galerie Thaddaeus Ropac, Paris and Galerie Yvon Lambert, Paris, the following year.{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\nIn 2006, Kiefer's exhibition, ''Velimir Chlebnikov'', was first shown in a small studio near Barjac, then moved to [[White Cube]] in London, then finishing in the [[Aldrich Contemporary Art Museum]] in Connecticut. The work consists of 30 large (2 x 3 meters) paintings, hanging in two banks of 15 on facing walls of an expressly constructed corrugated steel building that mimics the studio in which they were created. The work refers to the eccentric theories of the [[Russian Futurism|Russian futurist]] philosopher/poet [[Velimir Khlebnikov|Velimir Chlebnikov]], who invented a \"language of the future\" called \"Zaum\", and who postulated that cataclysmic sea battles shift the course of history once every 317 years. In his paintings, Kiefer's toy-like battleships\u2014misshapen, battered, rusted and hanging by twisted wires\u2014are cast about by paint and plaster waves. The work's recurrent color notes are black, white, gray, and rust; and their surfaces are rough and slathered with paint, plaster, mud and clay.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Anselm Kiefer at Aldrich Contemporary|author=Robert Ayers|publisher=ARTINFO|date=27 June 2006|url=http://www.artinfo.com/news/story/18155/anselm-kiefer-at-aldrich-contemporary/|accessdate=16 April 2008}}</ref>\n\nIn 2007, he became the first artist to be commissioned to install a permanent work at the [[Louvre]], Paris, since Georges Braque some 50 years earlier. The same year, he inaugurated the Monumenta exhibitions series at the Grand Palais<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.grandpalais.fr/en/article/monumenta|title=Monumenta|website=www.grandpalais.fr|language=en|access-date=2020-03-26}}</ref> in Paris, with works paying special tribute to the poets Paul Celan and Ingeborg Bachmann.\n\nIn 2009 Kiefer mounted two exhibitions at the White Cube gallery in London. A series of forest diptychs and triptychs enclosed in glass vitrines, many filled with dense Moroccan thorns, was titled ''Karfunkelfee'', a term from [[German Romanticism]] stemming from a poem by the post-war Austrian writer [[Ingeborg Bachmann]]. In ''The Fertile Crescent'', Kiefer presented a group of epic paintings inspired by a trip to India fifteen years earlier where he first encountered rural brick factories. Over the past decade, the photographs that Kiefer took in India \"reverberated\" in his mind to suggest a vast array of cultural and historical references, reaching from the first human civilization of [[Mesopotamia]] to the ruins of Germany in the aftermath of [[World War II|the Second World War]], where he played as a boy. \"Anyone in search of a resonant meditation on the instability of built grandeur\", wrote the historian [[Simon Schama]] in his catalogue essay, \"would do well to look hard at Kiefer\u2019s ''The Fertile Crescent''\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://whitecube.com/exhibitions/exhibition/anselm_kiefer_masons_yard_hoxton_square_2009|title=Anselm Kiefer: Karfunkelfee and The Fertile Crescent|date=16 October 2009|publisher=White Cube}}</ref>\n\nIn ''Morgenthau Plan'' (2012), the gallery is filled with a sculpture of a golden wheat field, enclosed in a five-meter-high steel cage.<ref>[http://www.gagosian.com/exhibitions/anselm-kiefer--october-19-2012] Anselm Kiefer: Morgenthau Plan, 19 October 2012 \u2013 26 January 2013, Gagosian Gallery, Paris</ref> That same year, Kiefer inaugurated Galerie Thaddaeus Ropac's gallery space in Pantin, with an exhibition of monumental new works, ''[https://www.ropac.net/exhibition/die-ungeborenen Die Ungeborenen].''

He continues to be represented by the gallery and participates in group and solo exhibitions at their various locations.{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\n===Books===\nIn 1969 Kiefer began to design books. Early examples are typically worked-over photographs; his more recent books consist of sheets of lead layered with paint, minerals, or dried plant matter. For example, he assembled numerous lead books on steel shelves in libraries, as symbols of the stored, discarded knowledge of history.<ref>[http://moma.org/collection/artist.php?artist_id=3086] Anselm Kiefer, Museum of Modern Art, New York</ref> The book ''Rhine'' (1981) comprises a sequence of 25 woodcuts that suggest a journey along the [[Rhine]] River; the river is central to Germany's geographical and historical development, acquiring an almost mythic significance in works such as Wagner's [[Der Ring des Nibelungen|Ring of the Nibelungs]]. Scenes of the unspoiled river are interrupted by dark, swirling pages that represent the sinking of the [[battleship Bismarck]] in 1941, during an Atlantic sortie codenamed [[Operation Rhein\u00fcbung|Rhine Exercise]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\n===Studios===\nKiefer's first large studio was in the attic of his home, a former schoolhouse in Hornbach. Years later he installed his studio in a factory building in Buchen, near Hornbach. In 1988, Kiefer transformed a former brick factory in H\u00f6pfingen (also near Buchen) into an extensive artwork including numerous installations and sculptures.<ref>''Anselm Kiefer: Studios'', Dani\u00e8le Cohn, Flammarion, 2013. </ref>   In 1991, after twenty years of working in the Odenwald, the artist left Germany to travel around the world--to India, Mexico, Japan, Thailand, Indonesia, Australia, and the United States.<ref>Alan Riding (3 April 2001), [https://www.nytimes.com/2001/04/03/arts/unseen-he-stares-down-history-look-art-says-anselm-kiefer-he-turns-jewish.html?src=pm] Unseen as He Stares Down History; Look at the Art, Says Anselm Kiefer as He Turns to Jewish Mysticism.

One critic wrote of the film: \"Building almost from the ground up in a derelict silk factory, Kiefer devised an artistic project extending over acres: miles of corridors, huge studio spaces with ambitious landscape paintings and sculptures that correspond to monumental constructions in the surrounding woodland, and serpentine excavated labyrinths with great earthy columns that resemble stalagmites or termite mounds.

In 1999 the Japan Art Association awarded him the [[Praemium Imperiale]] for his lifetime achievements. In the explanatory statement it reads:\n\n\"A complex critical engagement with history runs through Anselm Kiefer's work. His paintings as well as the sculptures of [[Georg Baselitz]] created an uproar at the 1980 Venice Biennale: the viewers had to decide whether the apparent Nazi motifs were meant ironically or whether the works were meant to convey actual fascist ideas. Kiefer worked with the conviction that art could heal a traumatized nation and a vexed, divided world. He created epic paintings on giant canvases that called up the history of German culture with the help of depictions of figures such as [[Richard Wagner]] or [[Goethe]], thus continuing the historical tradition of painting as a medium of addressing the world. Only a few contemporary artists have such a pronounced sense of art's duty to engage the past and the ethical questions of the present, and are in the position to express the possibility of the absolution of guilt through human effort.\"\n\nIn 2008, Kiefer was awarded the [[Peace Prize of the German Book Trade]], given for the first time to a visual artist.

He acknowledges the issue, but says change is part of the process and that their essence will ultimately stay the same. This idea of transformation has a kind of appeal for Kiefer and thus is featured in many of his works. This fascination for the process may have stemmed from the artist\u2019s keen interest in alchemy. He often chooses materials for their alchemical properties\u2014lead in particular being chief among them. In the case of lead, he specifically likes how the metal looks during the heating and melting process when he would see many colors\u2014especially that of gold\u2014which he thought of in a symbolic sense as the gold sought by alchemists. He is also particularly fond of the oxidation of white on lead. He would often try to induce oxidation artificially with the use of acid to speed up the process. Lead was also associated with the alchemical concepts of magic numbers and represented the planet Saturn.\n\nShellac, another material popular in his work, corresponded to lead in terms of how he felt about its color and energy possibilities. He also liked that while being polished it takes on energy and becomes warm to the touch.\n\nThe use of straw in his work is also in part the result of this common theme of energy. Straw again features the color gold and gives off energy, heat, and warmth when burned. This would make way for new creation thus continuing the cycle of life through the transformation process.<ref>14</ref>\nIn 2011, [[Christie's]] set a new worldwide record of $3.6&nbsp;million for the artist, when it sold ''To the Unknown Painter'' (1983) to an American private collector.<ref name=\"fever\" />\n\n==See also==\n*[[Holocaust memorial landscapes in Germany]]\n\n==Biography, criticism, catalogues, monographs, documentaries==\n* Alteveer, Ian.

He studied with [[Peter Dreher]] and [[Horst Antes]] end of the 1960s. His works incorporate materials such as [[straw]], [[wiktionary:ash|ash]], [[clay]], lead, and [[shellac]]. The poems of [[Paul Celan]] have played a role in developing Kiefer's themes of German history and the horror of [[the Holocaust]], as have the spiritual concepts of [[Kabbalah]].\n\nIn his entire body of work, Kiefer argues with the past and addresses [[taboo]] and controversial issues from recent history. Themes from [[Nazi Germany|Nazi rule]] are particularly reflected in his work; for instance, the painting \"Margarethe\" (oil and straw on canvas) was inspired by [[Paul Celan]]'s well-known poem \"''[[Todesfuge]]''\" (\"''Death Fugue''\").\n\nHis works are characterised by an unflinching willingness to confront his culture's dark past, and unrealised potential, in works that are often done on a large, confrontational scale well suited to the subjects. It is also characteristic of his work to find signatures and/or names of people of historical importance, legendary figures or historical places. All of these are encoded [[Sigil (magic)|sigils]] through which Kiefer seeks to process the past; this has resulted in his work being linked with the movements ''New Symbolism'' and ''Neo\u2013Expressionism''.<ref name=big>''Big Questions'', [[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian]], September 2006, p. 33</ref>\n\nKiefer has lived and worked in France since 1992.

In his middle years, his inspiration came from literary figures, namely [[Paul Celan]] and [[Ingeborg Bachmann]]. His later works incorporate themes from [[Judeo-Christian]], ancient Egyptian, and Oriental cultures, which he combines with other motifs. [[Cosmogony]] is also a large focus in his works. In all, Kiefer searches for the meaning of existence and \"representation of the incomprehensible and the non-representational.\"<ref>{{Citation|title=Anselm Kiefer|date=2019-04-07|url=https://de.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anselm_Kiefer&oldid=187321705|work=Wikipedia|language=de|access-date=2019-04-22}}</ref>{{Unreliable source?|date=May 2019|certain=y}}\n\n=== Philosophy ===\nKiefer values a \"spiritual connection\" with the materials he works with, \"extracting the spirit that already lives within [them].\"<ref name=\":1\" /> In doing so, he transforms his materials with acid baths and physical blows with sticks and axes, among other processes.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kennedy|first=Pete|date=|title=How I Challenge the Canons With My Four German Ghost Dissenters|url=|journal=Journal of Artists' Books|volume=38|pages=19\u201320|via=Columbia Chicago Center for Book & Paper Arts}}</ref>\n\nHe often chooses materials for their alchemical properties\u2014[[lead]] in particular. Kiefer's initial attraction to lead arose when he had to repair aging pipes in the first house he owned. Eventually, he came to admire its physical and sensory qualities and began to discover more about its connection to [[alchemy]].<ref name=\":1\" /> Physically, Kiefer specifically likes how the metal looks during the heating and melting process when he sees many colors, especially gold, which he associates to the symbolic gold sought by alchemists.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Albano|first=Albert P.|date=1998|title=Reflections on Painting, Alchemy, Nazism: Visiting with Anselm Kiefer|journal=Journal of the American Institute for Conservation|volume=37|issue=3|pages=348\u2013361|doi=10.2307/3179818|issn=0197-1360|jstor=3179818}}</ref>\n\nKiefer's use of straw in his work represents energy.

He worked with glass, straw, wood and plant parts. The use of these materials meant that his art works became temporary and fragile, as Kiefer himself was well aware; he also wanted to showcase the materials in such a way that they were not disguised and could be represented in their natural form. The fragility of his work contrasts with the stark subject matter in his paintings. This use of familiar materials to express ideas was influenced by Beuys, who used fat and carpet felt in his works. It is also typical of the Neo-Expressionist style.{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\nKiefer returned to the area of his birthplace in 1971. In the years that followed, he incorporated German mythology in particular in his work, and in the next decade he studied the [[Kabbalah]], as well as [[Hermetic Qabalah|Qabalists]] like Robert Fludd.<ref name=\"Rumelin\"/> He went on extended journeys throughout Europe, the USA and the Middle East; the latter two journeys further influenced his work.

Taking over 20 years to create (1971-1991), 20 Years of Solitude is a ceiling-high stack of hundreds of white-painted ledgers and handmade books, strewn with dirt and dried vegetation, whose pages are stained with the artist\u2019s semen. The word solitude in the title references the artists frequent masturbation onto paper during the 20 years it took to create. He asked American art critic Peter Schjeldahl to write a text for a catalog of the masturbation books. Schjeldahl attempted to oblige but ultimately failed in his endeavor. No other critic would take on the task, so the work has largely faded into obscurity.<ref name=Schjeldahl1998>{{cite web|last=Schjeldahl |first=Peter |title=lost in the terrain: anselm kiefer |date=12 February 1998 |url= http://www.artnet.com/magazine_pre2000/features/schjeldahl/schjeldahl2-12-98.asp |publisher=Artnet}}</ref>\n\nHe would shock the art world yet again at a dinner party in May of 1993. Kiefer and his second wife, Renate Graf, decorated a candlelit commercial loft in New York with white muslin, carpeted the floor with white sand, and staffed it with waiters dressed as mimes with white-face. A handful of art world elite, such as the likes of Sherrie Levine, were served several courses of arcane organ meats, such as pancreas, that were mostly white in color. Not surprisingly, the guests did not find the meal to be particularly appetizing. <ref name=Schjeldahl1998 />\n\nSince 2002, Kiefer has worked with concrete, creating the towers destined for the Pirelli warehouses in Milan, the series of tributes to [[Velimir Khlebnikov]] (paintings of the sea, with boats and an array of leaden objects, 2004-5), a return to the work of [[Paul Celan]]<ref>[http://ropac.net/exhibition/fur-paul-celan-1] Anselm Kiefer, Thaddaeus Ropac</ref> with a series of paintings featuring rune motifs (2004\u20136), and other sculptures.<ref>[http://archive.monumenta.com/2007/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=13&Itemid=9&lang=en]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Anselm Kiefer Biographie, Monumenta 2007, Paris</ref> In 2003, he held his first solo show at Galerie Thaddaeus Ropac, Salzburg Villa Katz, ''[https://www.ropac.net/exhibition/am-anfang Anselm Kiefer: Am Anfang],'' dedicated to a series of new works, centered on the recurring themes of history and myths. In 2005, he held his second exhibition in Galerie Thaddaeus Ropac's Salzburg location, ''[https://www.ropac.net/exhibition/fur-paul-celan F\u00fcr Paul Celan],'' which focused on Kiefer's preoccupation with the book, linking references to Germanic mythology with the poetry of Paul Celan, a German-speaking Jew from Czernowitz. The exhibition featured eleven works on canvas, a series of bound books shown in display cases, and five sculptures, including one powerful, monumental outdoor sculpture of reinforced concrete and lead elements, two leaden piles of books combined with bronze sunflowers, lead ships and wedges, and two monumental leaden books from the series The Secret Life of Plants. The exhibition toured to Galerie Thaddaeus Ropac, Paris and Galerie Yvon Lambert, Paris, the following year.{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\nIn 2006, Kiefer's exhibition, ''Velimir Chlebnikov'', was first shown in a small studio near Barjac, then moved to [[White Cube]] in London, then finishing in the [[Aldrich Contemporary Art Museum]] in Connecticut. The work consists of 30 large (2 x 3 meters) paintings, hanging in two banks of 15 on facing walls of an expressly constructed corrugated steel building that mimics the studio in which they were created. The work refers to the eccentric theories of the [[Russian Futurism|Russian futurist]] philosopher/poet [[Velimir Khlebnikov|Velimir Chlebnikov]], who invented a \"language of the future\" called \"Zaum\", and who postulated that cataclysmic sea battles shift the course of history once every 317 years. In his paintings, Kiefer's toy-like battleships\u2014misshapen, battered, rusted and hanging by twisted wires\u2014are cast about by paint and plaster waves. The work's recurrent color notes are black, white, gray, and rust; and their surfaces are rough and slathered with paint, plaster, mud and clay.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Anselm Kiefer at Aldrich Contemporary|author=Robert Ayers|publisher=ARTINFO|date=27 June 2006|url=http://www.artinfo.com/news/story/18155/anselm-kiefer-at-aldrich-contemporary/|accessdate=16 April 2008}}</ref>\n\nIn 2007, he became the first artist to be commissioned to install a permanent work at the [[Louvre]], Paris, since Georges Braque some 50 years earlier. The same year, he inaugurated the Monumenta exhibitions series at the Grand Palais<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.grandpalais.fr/en/article/monumenta|title=Monumenta|website=www.grandpalais.fr|language=en|access-date=2020-03-26}}</ref> in Paris, with works paying special tribute to the poets Paul Celan and Ingeborg Bachmann.\n\nIn 2009 Kiefer mounted two exhibitions at the White Cube gallery in London. A series of forest diptychs and triptychs enclosed in glass vitrines, many filled with dense Moroccan thorns, was titled ''Karfunkelfee'', a term from [[German Romanticism]] stemming from a poem by the post-war Austrian writer [[Ingeborg Bachmann]]. In ''The Fertile Crescent'', Kiefer presented a group of epic paintings inspired by a trip to India fifteen years earlier where he first encountered rural brick factories. Over the past decade, the photographs that Kiefer took in India \"reverberated\" in his mind to suggest a vast array of cultural and historical references, reaching from the first human civilization of [[Mesopotamia]] to the ruins of Germany in the aftermath of [[World War II|the Second World War]], where he played as a boy. \"Anyone in search of a resonant meditation on the instability of built grandeur\", wrote the historian [[Simon Schama]] in his catalogue essay, \"would do well to look hard at Kiefer\u2019s ''The Fertile Crescent''\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://whitecube.com/exhibitions/exhibition/anselm_kiefer_masons_yard_hoxton_square_2009|title=Anselm Kiefer: Karfunkelfee and The Fertile Crescent|date=16 October 2009|publisher=White Cube}}</ref>\n\nIn ''Morgenthau Plan'' (2012), the gallery is filled with a sculpture of a golden wheat field, enclosed in a five-meter-high steel cage.<ref>[http://www.gagosian.com/exhibitions/anselm-kiefer--october-19-2012] Anselm Kiefer: Morgenthau Plan, 19 October 2012 \u2013 26 January 2013, Gagosian Gallery, Paris</ref> That same year, Kiefer inaugurated Galerie Thaddaeus Ropac's gallery space in Pantin, with an exhibition of monumental new works, ''[https://www.ropac.net/exhibition/die-ungeborenen Die Ungeborenen].''

He continues to be represented by the gallery and participates in group and solo exhibitions at their various locations.{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\n===Books===\nIn 1969 Kiefer began to design books. Early examples are typically worked-over photographs; his more recent books consist of sheets of lead layered with paint, minerals, or dried plant matter. For example, he assembled numerous lead books on steel shelves in libraries, as symbols of the stored, discarded knowledge of history.<ref>[http://moma.org/collection/artist.php?artist_id=3086] Anselm Kiefer, Museum of Modern Art, New York</ref> The book ''Rhine'' (1981) comprises a sequence of 25 woodcuts that suggest a journey along the [[Rhine]] River; the river is central to Germany's geographical and historical development, acquiring an almost mythic significance in works such as Wagner's [[Der Ring des Nibelungen|Ring of the Nibelungs]]. Scenes of the unspoiled river are interrupted by dark, swirling pages that represent the sinking of the [[battleship Bismarck]] in 1941, during an Atlantic sortie codenamed [[Operation Rhein\u00fcbung|Rhine Exercise]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\n===Studios===\nKiefer's first studio was his home in Hornbach, a large converted brick factory.<ref>Roberta Smith (7 May 1993), [https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/07/arts/review-art-anselm-kiefer-emigre-in-two-part-installation.html?src=pm] Anselm Kiefer, Emigre, In Two-Part Installation.

One critic wrote of the film: \"Building almost from the ground up in a derelict silk factory, Kiefer devised an artistic project extending over acres: miles of corridors, huge studio spaces with ambitious landscape paintings and sculptures that correspond to monumental constructions in the surrounding woodland, and serpentine excavated labyrinths with great earthy columns that resemble stalagmites or termite mounds.

In 1999 the Japan Art Association awarded him the [[Praemium Imperiale]] for his lifetime achievements. In the explanatory statement it reads:\n\n\"A complex critical engagement with history runs through Anselm Kiefer's work. His paintings as well as the sculptures of [[Georg Baselitz]] created an uproar at the 1980 Venice Biennale: the viewers had to decide whether the apparent Nazi motifs were meant ironically or whether the works were meant to convey actual fascist ideas. Kiefer worked with the conviction that art could heal a traumatized nation and a vexed, divided world. He created epic paintings on giant canvases that called up the history of German culture with the help of depictions of figures such as [[Richard Wagner]] or [[Goethe]], thus continuing the historical tradition of painting as a medium of addressing the world. Only a few contemporary artists have such a pronounced sense of art's duty to engage the past and the ethical questions of the present, and are in the position to express the possibility of the absolution of guilt through human effort.\"\n\nIn 2008, Kiefer was awarded the [[Peace Prize of the German Book Trade]], given for the first time to a visual artist. Art historian [[Werner Spies]] said in his speech that Kiefer is a passionate reader who takes impulses from literature for his work.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boersenverein.de/de/96671?pid=199913|title=2008 winner: Anselm Kiefer|author=Spies, Werner|accessdate=29 October 2010|publisher=Boersenverein|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101008185107/http://www.boersenverein.de/de/96671?pid=199913|archivedate=8 October 2010|url-status= live}}</ref> In 2011 Kiefer was appointed to the chair of creativity in art at the [[Coll\u00e8ge de France]].\n\n* 1983 \u2013 Hans-Thoma-Preis (Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg)\n* 1985 \u2013 [[Carnegie Prize]]\n* 1990 \u2013 [[Wolf Prize in Arts]]\n* 1990 \u2013 Knight of [[Ordre des Arts et des Lettres]]\n* 1990 \u2013 [[Goslarer Kaiserring]]\n* 1997 \u2013 International Prize by the Jury of the 47th [[Venice Biennale]]\n* 1999 \u2013 [[Praemium Imperiale]] (Japan)\n* 2002 \u2013 Officer of [[Ordre des Arts et des Lettres]]\n* 2004 \u2013 Foreign Honorary Member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]]\n* 2005 \u2013 [[Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany|Merit Cross 1st Class of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany]] (''Verdienstkreuz 1.

He acknowledges the issue, but says change is part of the process and that their essence will ultimately stay the same. This idea of transformation has a kind of appeal for Kiefer and thus is featured in many of his works. This fascination for the process may have stemmed from the artist\u2019s keen interest in alchemy. He often chooses materials for their alchemical properties\u2014lead in particular being chief among them. In the case of lead, he specifically likes how the metal looks during the heating and melting process when he would see many colors\u2014especially that of gold\u2014which he thought of in a symbolic sense as the gold sought by alchemists. He is also particularly fond of the oxidation of white on lead. He would often try to induce oxidation artificially with the use of acid to speed up the process. Lead was also associated with the alchemical concepts of magic numbers and represented the planet Saturn.\n\nShellac, another material popular in his work, corresponded to lead in terms of how he felt about its color and energy possibilities. He also liked that while being polished it takes on energy and becomes warm to the touch.\n\nThe use of straw in his work is also in part the result of this common theme of energy. Straw again features the color gold and gives off energy, heat, and warmth when burned. This would make way for new creation thus continuing the cycle of life through the transformation process.<ref>14</ref>\nIn 2011, [[Christie's]] set a new worldwide record of $3.6&nbsp;million for the artist, when it sold ''To the Unknown Painter'' (1983) to an American private collector.<ref name=\"fever\" />\n\n==See also==\n*[[Holocaust memorial landscapes in Germany]]\n\n==Biography, criticism, catalogues, monographs, documentaries==\n* Alteveer, Ian.

Kramer]]. He dropped out of the Senate race, but in early 2010 two seats in the House of Delegates became open when incumbent Delegate [[Karen S. Montgomery]] decided to challenge Kramer and Delegate [[Herman L. Taylor, Jr.]] began a campaign against Congresswoman [[Donna Edwards]]. Luedtke entered the campaign for one of the district's three seats in the House of Delegates, competing against seven other Democrats in the primary. In the primary election on September 14, 2010, Luedtke finished in third place, behind incumbent Delegate [[Anne Kaiser]] and political staffer [[Craig Zucker]]. Democrats swept the general election in the district, winning the three Delegate seats as well as the Senate seat. Luedtke was sworn into the House of Delegates on January 12, 2011.\n\nDuring his first term in the House of Delegates, Luedtke was assigned to the House Ways and Means Committee, which oversees tax policy, education, election law, and gambling. He participated in debates on a number of major issues in his first year. During the floor debate on the Civil Marriage Protection Act, which would have legalized same-sex marriage in Maryland, Luedtke helped defeat hostile amendments.<ref>{{cite web|title=On the Eve of the Final Debate - Same Sex Marriage in Md.|url=http://storify.com/cnsmd/same-sex-marriage-summary|publisher=Capital News Service|accessdate=2011-06-10}}</ref> He also played a role in passage of the Maryland Dream Act, giving undocumented immigrants the right to in state tuition at Maryland Universities.

Kramer]]. He dropped out of the Senate race, but in early 2010 two seats in the House of Delegates became open when incumbent Delegate [[Karen S. Montgomery]] decided to challenge Kramer and Delegate [[Herman L. Taylor, Jr.]] began a campaign against Congresswoman [[Donna Edwards]]. Luedtke entered the campaign for one of the district's three seats in the House of Delegates, competing against seven other Democrats in the primary. In the primary election on September 14, 2010, Luedtke finished in third place, behind incumbent Delegate [[Anne Kaiser]] and political staffer [[Craig Zucker]]. Democrats swept the general election in the district, winning the three Delegate seats as well as the Senate seat. Luedtke was sworn into the House of Delegates on January 12, 2011.\n\nDuring his first term in the House of Delegates, Luedtke was assigned to the House Ways and Means Committee, which oversees tax policy, education, election law, and gambling. He participated in debates on a number of major issues in his first year. During the floor debate on the Civil Marriage Protection Act, which would have legalized same-sex marriage in Maryland, Luedtke helped defeat hostile amendments.<ref>{{cite web|title=On the Eve of the Final Debate - Same Sex Marriage in Md.|url=http://storify.com/cnsmd/same-sex-marriage-summary|publisher=Capital News Service|accessdate=2011-06-10}}</ref> He also played a role in passage of the Maryland Dream Act, giving undocumented immigrants the right to in state tuition at Maryland Universities.

Before 1960 there was only one award for both play direction and musical direction, then in 1960 the award was split into two categories: ''Dramatic'' and ''Musical''.  In 1976 the Dramatic category was renamed to Play.

Gold and green are the dominant colours in the bars and foyer, which include the original light fittings. Upon its opening on 27 April 1928, the theatre's souvenir brochure claimed, \"If all the bricks used in the building were laid in a straight line, they would stretch from London to Paris.\" The opening production, [[Jerome Kern]]'s musical ''Blue Eyes'', starred [[Evelyn Laye]], one of the most acclaimed actresses of the period.<ref name=Lloyd>[http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/PiccadillyTheatre.htm Piccadilly Theatre History, at Arthur Lloyd website] accessed 23 August 2007</ref>\n\nThe Piccadilly was briefly taken over by [[Warner Brothers]], and operated as a [[movie theatre|cinema]] using the [[Vitaphone|Vitaphone system]], and premi\u00e8red the first talking picture to be shown in [[UK|Great Britain]], ''[[The Singing Fool]]'' with [[Al Jolson]].

[[The Beatles]] recorded a number of songs at the Piccadilly on 28 February 1964 for the BBC Radio show, \"From Us to You\". In 1976, the [[Jerome Kern]] and [[Guy Bolton]] musical ''[[Very Good Eddie]]'' ran for 411 performances at the theatre.
