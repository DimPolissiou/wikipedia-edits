Whereas in some countries, such as [[coal in Turkey|Turkey]], they are only reported to the government not the public. However, since the late 2010s [[Sentinel-5_Precursor#Tropomi|satellite measurements]] of some pollutants have been available.\n\n===Combustion By-products===\nBy-products of coal combustion are compounds which are released into the atmosphere as a result of burning coal. Coal includes contaminants such as sulfur compounds and non-combustible minerals. When coal is burned, the minerals become ash (i.e. [[particulate matter]] or PM) and the sulfur forms sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>). Since air is mostly [[nitrogen]], combustion of coal often leads to production of [[nitrogen oxide]]s. [[Sulfur dioxide]] and [[nitrogen oxide]]s are primary causes of [[acid rain]]. For many years\u2014before greenhouse gasses were widely understood to be a threat\u2014it was thought that these by-products were the only drawback to using coal. These by-products are still a problem, but they have been greatly diminished in most advanced countries due to clean air regulations.\nIt is possible to remove most of the sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>), [[nitrogen oxide]]s (NO<sub>x</sub>), and [[particulates|particulate matter]] (PM) emissions from the coal-burning process. For example, various techniques are used in a [[coal preparation plant]] to reduce the amount of non-combustible matter (i.e. ash) in the coal prior to burning. During combustion, [[fluidized bed combustion]] is used to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions. After burning, particulate matter (i.e. ash and dust) can be reduced using an [[electrostatic precipitator]] and sulfur dioxide emissions can be further reduced with [[flue-gas desulfurization]]. Trace amounts of [[radionuclide]]s are more difficult to remove.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\nCoal-fired power plants are the largest aggregate source of the toxic heavy metal [[mercury (element)|mercury]]: 50 tons per year come from coal power plants out of 150 tons emitted nationally in the US and 5000 tons globally. However, according to the United States Geological Survey, the trace amounts of mercury in coal by-products do not pose a threat to public health.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ornl.gov/info/ornlreview/rev26-34/text/colmain.html |publisher=Oak Ridge National Laboratory |title=Coal Combustion: Nuclear Resource or Danger? |author=Alex Gabbard |year=1993 |accessdate=2008-08-09 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070205103749/http://www.ornl.gov/info/ornlreview/rev26-34/text/colmain.html |archive-date=2007-02-05}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.ornl.gov/sites/default/files/ORNL%20Review%20v26n3-4%201993.pdf#page=26 |journal=ORNL Review |publisher=Oak Ridge National Laboratory |title=Coal Combustion: Nuclear Resource or Danger? |author=Alex Gabbard |volume=24 |number=3-4 |year=1993 |page=24 |accessdate=2020-01-05}}</ref> A study in 2013 found that mercury found in the fish in the Pacific Ocean could possibly be linked to coal-fired plants in Asia.{{cn|date=January 2020}}\n\n==Potential financial impact==\nWhether carbon capture and storage technology is adopted worldwide will \"...depend less on science than on economics.

Bush]] on several occasions, including his 2007 [[State of the Union Address]]. Bush's position was that carbon capture and storage technologies should be encouraged as one means to reduce the country's dependence on foreign oil.\n\nDuring the [[2008 United States presidential election|US Presidential campaign for 2008]], both candidates [[John McCain]] and [[Barack Obama]] expressed interest in the development of CCS technologies as part of an overall comprehensive energy plan. The development of pollution mitigation technologies could also create export business for the United States or any other country working on it.\n\nThe [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009|American Reinvestment and Recovery Act]], signed in 2009 by President Obama, allocated $3.4 billion for advanced carbon capture and storage technologies, including demonstration projects.\n\nFormer Secretary of State [[Hillary Clinton]] has said that \"we should strive to have new electricity generation come from other sources, such as clean coal and renewables\", and former Energy Secretary [[Steven Chu|Dr. Steven Chu]] has said that \"It is absolutely worthwhile to invest in carbon capture and storage\", noting that even if the U.S. and Europe turned their backs on coal, developing nations like India and China would likely not.\n\nDuring the first [[United States presidential election debates, 2012|2012 United States presidential election debate]], [[Mitt Romney]] expressed his support for clean coal, and claimed that current federal policies were hampering the coal industry.<ref name=\"npr2012-10-03\">{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2012/10/03/162258551/transcript-first-obama-romney-presidential-debate|title=Transcript And Audio: First Obama-Romney Debate|date=2012-10-03|publisher=[[Federal News Service]]|website=[[NPR]]|accessdate=2013-05-24}}</ref>\n\n====Office of Clean Coal and Carbon Management====\n<!--Office of Clean Coal and Carbon Management redirects here-->\n<!--If you change this section title, please provide an anchor of some sort for this redirect-->\n{{sectstub|date=February 2020}}\nThe Office of Clean Coal and Carbon Management is part of the [[United States Department of Energy]].

It's an [[oxymoron]].\" The Sierra Club's Coal Campaign has launched a site refuting the clean coal statements and advertising of the coal industry.\n\nComplaints focus on the environmental impacts of [[coal mining|coal extraction]], high costs to [[carbon capture and storage|sequester carbon]], and uncertainty of how to manage end result [[air pollution|pollutants]] and [[radionuclide]]s. In reference to sequestration of carbon, concerns exist about whether geologic storage of CO<sub>2</sub> in reservoirs, aquifers, ''etc.'', is indefinite/permanent.\n\nThe palaeontologist and influential environmental activist [[Tim Flannery]] made the assertion that the concept of clean coal might not be viable for all geographical locations.\n\nCritics also believe that the continuing construction of coal-powered plants (whether or not they use carbon sequestration techniques) encourages unsustainable mining practices for coal, which can strip away mountains, hillsides, and natural areas. They also point out that there can be a large amount of energy required and pollution emitted in transporting the coal to the power plants.\n\n[[The Climate Reality Project|The Reality Coalition]], a US non-profit climate organization composed of the Alliance for Climate Protection, the [[Sierra Club]], the [[National Wildlife Federation]], the [[Natural Resources Defense Council]], and the [[League of Conservation Voters]], ran a series of television commercials in 2008 and 2009. The commercials were highly critical of attempts to mitigate coal's pollution, stating that without capturing CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and storing it safely that it cannot be called \"clean coal\".\n\n[[Greenpeace]] is a major opponent of the concept, because they view emissions and wastes as not being avoided but instead transferred from one [[waste stream]] to another. According to [[Greenpeace USA]]'s Executive Director [[Phil Radford]] speaking in 2012, \"even the industry figures it will take 10 or 20 years to arrive, and we need solutions sooner than that. We need to scale up renewable energy; 'clean coal' is a distraction from that.\"\n\n==Clean coal==\nThe term Clean Coal in modern society often refers to the [[carbon capture and storage]] process. The term has been used by advertisers, lobbyists, and politicians such as [[Donald Trump]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Conditt|first=Jessica|date=March 30, 2017|title=Dear Donald Trump: 'Clean coal' doesn't exist|url=https://www.engadget.com/2017/03/30/clean-coal-myth-trump-carbon-capture-energy-no/|accessdate=2017-04-14}}</ref>\n\n===Prior terminology===\nThe industry term \"clean coal\" is increasingly used in reference to carbon capture and storage, an advanced theoretical process that would eliminate or significantly reduce carbon dioxide emissions from coal-based plants and permanently sequester them. More generally, the term has been found in modern usage to describe technologies designed to enhance both the efficiency and the environmental acceptability of coal extraction, preparation, and use.\n\nU.S. Senate Bill 911 in April, 1987, defined clean coal technology as follows:\n\n<blockquote>\"The term clean coal technology means any technology...deployed at a new or existing facility which will achieve significant reductions in air emissions of sulfur dioxide or oxides of nitrogen associated with the utilization of coal in the generation of electricity.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://behindtheplug.americaspower.org/2009/03/the-definition-of-clean-coal.html|title=The definition of clean coal \u00ab Behind The Plug|access-date=2012-08-28|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130221052204/http://behindtheplug.americaspower.org/2009/03/the-definition-of-clean-coal.html|archive-date=2013-02-21}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nBefore being adopted in this fashion, historically \"clean coal\" was used to refer to clean-burning coal with low levels of impurities, though this term faded after rates of domestic coal usage dropped.

These emissions have been established to have a negative impact on the environment and human health, contributing to acid rain, lung cancer and cardiovascular disease. As a result, clean coal technologies are being developed to remove or reduce pollutant emissions to the atmosphere. Some of the techniques that would be used to accomplish this include chemically washing [[mineral]]s and impurities from the coal, [[gasification]] (see also [[Integrated gasification combined cycle|IGCC]]), improved technology for treating [[flue]] gases to remove pollutants to increasingly stringent levels and at higher efficiency, [[carbon capture and storage]] technologies to capture the carbon dioxide from the [[flue gas]] and dewatering lower rank coals ([[brown coal]]s) to improve the [[calorific value]], and thus the efficiency of the conversion into [[electricity]].

Whereas in some countries, such as [[coal in Turkey|Turkey]], they are only reported to the government not the public. However since the late 2010s [[Sentinel-5_Precursor#Tropomi|satellite measurements]] of some pollutants have been available.\n\n===Combustion By-products===\nBy-products of coal combustion are compounds which are released into the atmosphere as a result of burning coal. Coal includes contaminants such as sulfur compounds and non-combustible minerals. When coal is burned, the minerals become ash (i.e. [[particulate matter]] or PM) and the sulfur forms sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>). Since air is mostly [[nitrogen]], combustion of coal often leads to production of [[nitrogen oxide]]s. [[Sulfur dioxide]] and [[nitrogen oxide]]s are primary causes of [[acid rain]]. For many years\u2014before greenhouse gasses were widely understood to be a threat\u2014it was thought that these by-products were the only drawback to using coal. These by-products are still a problem, but they have been greatly diminished in most advanced countries due to clean air regulations.\nIt is possible to remove most of the sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>), [[nitrogen oxide]]s (NO<sub>x</sub>), and [[particulates|particulate matter]] (PM) emissions from the coal-burning process. For example, various techniques are used in a [[coal preparation plant]] to reduce the amount of non-combustible matter (i.e. ash) in the coal prior to burning. During combustion, [[fluidized bed combustion]] is used to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions. After burning, particulate matter (i.e. ash and dust) can be reduced using an [[electrostatic precipitator]] and sulfur dioxide emissions can be further reduced with [[flue-gas desulfurization]]. Trace amounts of [[radionuclide]]s are more difficult to remove.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\nCoal-fired power plants are the largest aggregate source of the toxic heavy metal [[mercury (element)|mercury]]: 50 tons per year come from coal power plants out of 150 tons emitted nationally in the US and 5000 tons globally.

It's an [[oxymoron]].\" The Sierra Club's Coal Campaign has launched a site refuting the clean coal statements and advertising of the coal industry.\n\nComplaints focus on the environmental impacts of [[coal mining|coal extraction]], high costs to [[carbon capture and storage|sequester carbon]], and uncertainty of how to manage end result [[air pollution|pollutants]] and [[radionuclide]]s. In reference to sequestration of carbon, concerns exist about whether geologic storage of CO<sub>2</sub> in reservoirs, aquifers, ''etc.'', is indefinite/permanent.\n\nThe palaeontologist and influential environmental activist [[Tim Flannery]] made the assertion that the concept of clean coal might not be viable for all geographical locations.\n\nCritics also believe that the continuing construction of coal-powered plants (whether or not they use carbon sequestration techniques) encourages unsustainable mining practices for coal, which can strip away mountains, hillsides, and natural areas. They also point out that there can be a large amount of energy required and pollution emitted in transporting the coal to the power plants.\n\n[[The Climate Reality Project|The Reality Coalition]], a US non-profit climate organization composed of the Alliance for Climate Protection, the [[Sierra Club]], the [[National Wildlife Federation]], the [[Natural Resources Defense Council]], and the [[League of Conservation Voters]], ran a series of television commercials in 2008 and 2009. The commercials were highly critical of attempts to mitigate coal's pollution, stating that without capturing CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and storing it safely that it cannot be called \"clean coal\".\n\n[[Greenpeace]] is a major opponent of the concept, because they view emissions and wastes as not being avoided but instead transferred from one [[waste stream]] to another. According to [[Greenpeace USA]]'s Executive Director [[Phil Radford]] speaking in 2012, \"even the industry figures it will take 10 or 20 years to arrive, and we need solutions sooner than that. We need to scale up renewable energy; 'clean coal' is a distraction from that.\"\n\n==Clean coal==\nThe term Clean Coal in modern society often refers to the [[carbon capture and storage]] process. The term has been used by advertisers, lobbyists, and politicians such as [[Donald Trump]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Conditt|first=Jessica|date=March 30, 2017|title=Dear Donald Trump: 'Clean coal' doesn't exist|url=https://www.engadget.com/2017/03/30/clean-coal-myth-trump-carbon-capture-energy-no/|accessdate=2017-04-14}}</ref>\n\n===Prior terminology===\nThe industry term \"clean coal\" is increasingly used in reference to carbon capture and storage, an advanced theoretical process that would eliminate or significantly reduce carbon dioxide emissions from coal-based plants and permanently sequester them. More generally, the term has been found in modern usage to describe technologies designed to enhance both the efficiency and the environmental acceptability of coal extraction, preparation, and use.\n\nU.S. Senate Bill 911 in April, 1987, defined clean coal technology as follows:\n\n<blockquote>\"The term clean coal technology means any technology...deployed at a new or existing facility which will achieve significant reductions in air emissions of sulfur dioxide or oxides of nitrogen associated with the utilization of coal in the generation of electricity.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://behindtheplug.americaspower.org/2009/03/the-definition-of-clean-coal.html|title=The definition of clean coal \u00ab Behind The Plug|access-date=2012-08-28|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130221052204/http://behindtheplug.americaspower.org/2009/03/the-definition-of-clean-coal.html|archive-date=2013-02-21}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nBefore being adopted in this fashion, historically \"clean coal\" was used to refer to clean-burning coal with low levels of impurities, though this term faded after rates of domestic coal usage dropped.

These emissions have been established to have a negative impact on the environment and human health, contributing to acid rain, lung cancer and cardiovascular disease. As a result, clean coal technologies are being developed to remove or reduce pollutant emissions to the atmosphere. Some of the techniques that would be used to accomplish this include chemically washing [[mineral]]s and impurities from the coal, [[gasification]] (see also [[Integrated gasification combined cycle|IGCC]]), improved technology for treating [[flue]] gases to remove pollutants to increasingly stringent levels and at higher efficiency, [[carbon capture and storage]] technologies to capture the carbon dioxide from the [[flue gas]] and dewatering lower rank coals ([[brown coal]]s) to improve the [[calorific value]], and thus the efficiency of the conversion into [[electricity]].

He is internationally known as '''\u00c1lvaro Siza''' ({{IPA-pt|\u02c8a\u026bv\u0250\u027eu \u02c8siz\u0250}}) and in Portugal as '''Siza Vieira''' ({{IPA-pt|\u02c8siz\u0250 \u02c8vjej\u027e\u0250}}).\n\n==Early life and education==\nSiza was born in [[Matosinhos]], a small coastal town near [[Porto]].  He graduated in architecture in 1955, at the former School of Fine Arts of the [[University of Porto]], the current [[Porto School of Architecture|FAUP]] &ndash; ''Faculdade de Arquitectura da Universidade do Porto''. \n\n==Career==\nSiza completed his first built work (four houses in Matosinhos) even before ending his studies in 1954, the same year that he first opened his private practice in Porto. Along with [[Fernando T\u00e1vora]], he soon became one of the references of the [[Porto School of Architecture]] where both were teachers. Both architects worked together between 1955 and 1958. Another architect he has collaborated with is [[Eduardo Souto de Moura]], e.g. on Portugal's [[Pavilion of Portugal in Expo'98|flagship pavilions]] at [[Expo '98]] in Lisbon and [[Expo 2000]] in Hannover, as well as on the [[Serpentine Gallery|Serpentine Pavillon]] 2005. Siza's work is often described as \"poetic [[modernism]]\";<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2008/oct/08/alvaro.siza.riba.prize Jonathan Glancey: ''A Gold Medal for Siza? About time''] in ''The Guardian'', 8 October 2008</ref> he himself has contributed to publications on [[Luis Barrag\u00e1n]].\n\nAmong Siza's earliest works to gain public attention was a public pool complex (named [[Piscinas de Mar\u00e9s]]) he created in the 1960s for Le\u00e7a da Palmeira, a fishing town and summer resort north of Porto. Completed in 1966, both of the two swimming pools (one for children, the other for adults) as well as the building with changing rooms and a cafe are set into the natural rock formation on the site with unobstructed views of the sea.<ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/1992/04/27/arts/a-portuguese-wins-pritzker-award.html |title= A Portuguese Wins Pritzker Award |newspaper= [[New York Times]] |date= 27 April 1992}}</ref> In 1977, following the revolution in Portugal, the city government of [[\u00c9vora]] commissioned Siza to plan a housing project in the rural outskirts of the town. It was to be one of several that he would do for SAAL (''Servi\u00e7o de Apoio Ambulat\u00f3rio Local''), the national housing association, consisting of 1,200 low-cost, housing units, some one-story and some two-story row houses, all with courtyards.<ref name=\"Pritzker\"/> He was also a member of the team which reconstructed Chiado, the historic center of Lisbon destroyed by a fire in 1988.\n\nMost of his best known works are located in his hometown Porto: the Boa Nova Tea House (1963), the [[FAUP|Faculty of Architecture]] (1987\u201393), and the [[Serralves Foundation|Serralves Museum of Contemporary Art]] (1997).

He graduated in architecture in 1955, at the former School of Fine Arts of the [[University of Porto]], the current [[Porto School of Architecture|FAUP]] &ndash; ''Faculdade de Arquitectura da Universidade do Porto''. \n\n==Career==\nSiza completed his first built work (four houses in Matosinhos) even before ending his studies in 1954, the same year that he first opened his private practice in Porto. Along with [[Fernando T\u00e1vora]], he soon became one of the references of the [[Porto School of Architecture]] where both were teachers. Both architects worked together between 1955 and 1958. Another architect he has collaborated with is [[Eduardo Souto de Moura]], e.g. on Portugal's [[Pavilion of Portugal in Expo'98|flagship pavilions]] at [[Expo '98]] in Lisbon and [[Expo 2000]] in Hannover, as well as on the [[Serpentine Gallery|Serpentine Pavillon]] 2005.

Completed in 1966, both of the two swimming pools (one for children, the other for adults) as well as the building with changing rooms and a cafe are set into the natural rock formation on the site with unobstructed views of the sea.<ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/1992/04/27/arts/a-portuguese-wins-pritzker-award.html |title= A Portuguese Wins Pritzker Award |newspaper= [[New York Times]] |date= 27 April 1992}}</ref> In 1977, following the revolution in Portugal, the city government of [[\u00c9vora]] commissioned Siza to plan a housing project in the rural outskirts of the town.
