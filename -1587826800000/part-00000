Olsdal began playing music in his school's orchestra in 1987. He completed his high school education in Sweden and moved to [[London]] in 1993, where he attended the Musicians Institute.\n\nHe is openly [[gay]]. He came out publicly in an interview in ''[[Melody Maker]]'' in 1996. Olsdal and his partner David Amen have a son.\n\nIn 2013, he mixed the EP \"El Encanto\" of [[Lantana (singer)|Lantana]] and produced two of the songs of the album, also playing some of the synthesisers, bass and guitars. He also did a lot of the programming for the album.\n\nIn 2016 Olsdal produced 'La Chica Con Los Ojos Dorados', and the Fangoria album \"Canciones Para Robots Romanticos\" as well as the release of the debut album \"Inside\" from his band Digital 21 + Stefan Olsdal.\n\nHe has worked as producer, arranger, musician and mixer on an LP by Lantana.\n\n==Placebo==\nOlsdal met Molko by chance outside [[South Kensington tube station]] in 1992. The two of them formed Ashtray Heart, a [[lo-fi]] duo, playing mostly on toy instruments. They wrote four songs, but decided to try out as a serious band, so they invited [[Steve Hewitt]] who could not be in the band because he was already signed to another record company. After that, Olsdal invited old schoolmate [[Robert Schultzberg]] (who was at the time studying in UK) to join as Placebo's drummer (Hewitt would later replace him as the full-time drummer).\n\nTogether with Molko, he is credited as co-author on every Placebo song to date (except \"[[Ashtray Heart]]\" from ''[[Battle for the Sun]]'') and co-produced ''[[Black Market Music (album)|Black Market Music]]'' and some [[A-side and B-side|b-sides]].\n\n==Hotel Persona==\n<!--This section is redirected to from [[Hotel Persona]].-->\nHotel Persona began when Olsdal and David Amen started providing dance tunes to friends' house parties; Javier Solo was recruited to sing Spanish vocals, and Olsdal sang the English versions. As the music was coming together, Olsdal and Amen did DJ work under the Hotel Persona name in such locations as Milan, Paris, London, Barcelona and Rio. They have also remixed songs by various bands, including [[Queens of the Stone Age]], Placebo and [[She Wants Revenge]].\n\nTheir debut album ''In the Clouds'' was recorded and mixed in London, Madrid and New York over two years and features a wide array of additional vocals from various artists including [[Brian Molko]], [[Samantha Fox]], [[Miguel Bos\u00e9]] and [[Alaska (singer)|Alaska]] of [[Fangoria (band)|Fangoria]].\n\nIn 2007, they remixed the song \"Siempre\" for Lantana.\n\n==Production==\n*2017: ''Inside'' by Digital 21 + Stefan Olsdal: producer\n*2016: ''Sinestesia'' (bonus track) from the album ''Canciones Para Robots Rom\u00e1nticos'' by Fangoria: producer \n*2015: ''La Chica de los Ojos Dorados'' (LP) by [[Lantalba]]: producer, musician and mixing<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.placeboworld.co.uk/news/la-chica-de-los-ojos-dorados|title=Placebo Official Site News|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313201755/http://www.placeboworld.co.uk/news/la-chica-de-los-ojos-dorados|archive-date=13 March 2016}}</ref>\n*2013: ''El Encanto'' (EP) by Lantana: musician and mixer<ref>{{cite news|title=MusicBrainz.org Database|url = http://musicbrainz.org/release/4d390ec6-8ff8-4889-b43a-131f517039f1}}</ref>\n*2013: \"La noche de los muertos vivientes\" (single) by Lantana: producer, musician, mixing and mastering\n*2008: ''Into The Clouds'' by Hotel Persona: producer \n*2007: \"Siempre \u2013 Hotel Persona\" (remix) by Lantana: remixer\n\n==Remixes== \n*Lantana \"Siempre\" Hotel Persona Remix\n*She Wants Revenge \"I Want To Tear You Apart\" Hotel Persona Remix\n*Placebo \"[[Infra-Red (song)|Infra-Red]]\" Hotel Persona Remix\n*Placebo \"I Do\" (Material Mix) Remix (Placebo \u2013 I Do (Material Mix) (Once More With Feeling (Singles 1996\u20132004) Mexican Limited Edition Album)\n\n==Equipment==\nOlsdal uses a variety of instruments, including a Gibson Thunderbird (three: one vintage used since 2003, one modern black which replaced the Flying V in 2006 and one white used since 2009), Fender Jazz Bass, Fender Bass VI, Gibson Les Paul Custom and a Gretsch Anniversary. In live versions of \"[[Teenage Angst (song)|Teenage Angst]]\", \"Centrefolds\" and most acoustic performances he used a Technics keyboard. During the ''[[Meds]]'' era, he also used an Epiphone Flying V Bass for live performances of \"[[Nancy Boy]]\", \"[[Come Home (Placebo song)|Come Home]]\" and other occasional songs (mostly rarely played songs from the first album), which appeared on the \"[[Infra-Red (song)|Infra-Red]]\" video, although this guitar was smashed by Olsdal at the end of their 2006 [[Reading Festival]] set. He is seen playing an olympic white [[Fender Jaguar Bass]] in the \"[[For What It's Worth (Placebo song)|For What It's Worth]]\" video, and played a white [[Rickenbacker]] bass in live performance on television programs. He has also been playing a Charger bass, built by the luthiers TAO Guitars in Brussels.\n\nHis amplification is a mixture of [[Ampeg]] (for basses) and [[Marshall Amplification|Marshall]] (for guitars) amplifiers.

Olsdal began playing music in his school's orchestra in 1987. He completed his high school education in Sweden and moved to [[London]] in 1993, where he attended the Musicians Institute.\n\nHe is openly [[gay]]. He came out publicly in an interview in ''[[Melody Maker]]'' in 1996. Olsdal and his partner David Amen have a son.\n\nIn 2013, he mixed the EP \"El Encanto\" of [[Lantana (singer)|Lantana]] and produced two of the songs of the album, also playing some of the synthesisers, bass and guitars. He also did a lot of the programming for the album.\n\nIn 2016 Olsdal produced 'La Chica Con Los Ojos Dorados', and the Fangoria album \"Canciones Para Robots Romanticos\" as well as the release of the debut album \"Inside\" from his band Digital 21 + Stefan Olsdal.\n\nHe has worked as producer, arranger, musician and mixer on an LP by Lantana.\n\n==Placebo==\nOlsdal met Molko by chance outside [[South Kensington tube station]] in 1992. The two of them formed Ashtray Heart, a [[lo-fi]] duo, playing mostly on toy instruments. They wrote four songs, but decided to try out as a serious band, so they invited [[Steve Hewitt]] who could not be in the band because he was already signed to another record company. After that, Olsdal invited old schoolmate [[Robert Schultzberg]] (who was at the time studying in UK) to join as Placebo's drummer (Hewitt would later replace him as the full-time drummer).\n\nTogether with Molko, he is credited as co-author on every Placebo song to date (except \"[[Ashtray Heart]]\" from ''[[Battle for the Sun]]'') and co-produced ''[[Black Market Music (album)|Black Market Music]]'' and some [[A-side and B-side|b-sides]].\n\n==Hotel Persona==\n<!--This section is redirected to from [[Hotel Persona]].-->\nHotel Persona began when Olsdal and David Amen started providing dance tunes to friends' house parties; Javier Solo was recruited to sing Spanish vocals, and Olsdal sang the English versions. As the music was coming together, Olsdal and Amen did DJ work under the Hotel Persona name in such locations as Milan, Paris, London, Barcelona and Rio. They have also remixed songs by various bands, including [[Queens of the Stone Age]], Placebo and [[She Wants Revenge]].\n\nTheir debut album ''In the Clouds'' was recorded and mixed in London, Madrid and New York over two years and features a wide array of additional vocals from various artists including [[Brian Molko]], [[Samantha Fox]], [[Miguel Bos\u00e9]] and [[Alaska (singer)|Alaska]] of [[Fangoria (band)|Fangoria]].\n\nIn 2007, they remixed the song \"Siempre\" for Lantana.\n\n==Production==\n*2017: ''Inside'' by Digital 21 + Stefan Olsdal: producer\n*2016: ''Sinestesia'' (bonus track) from the album ''Canciones Para Robots Rom\u00e1nticos'' by Fangoria: producer \n*2015: ''La Chica de los Ojos Dorados'' (LP) by [[Lantalba]]: producer, musician and mixing<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.placeboworld.co.uk/news/la-chica-de-los-ojos-dorados|title=Placebo Official Site News|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313201755/http://www.placeboworld.co.uk/news/la-chica-de-los-ojos-dorados|archive-date=13 March 2016}}</ref>\n*2013: ''El Encanto'' (EP) by Lantana: musician and mixer<ref>{{cite news|title=MusicBrainz.org Database|url = http://musicbrainz.org/release/4d390ec6-8ff8-4889-b43a-131f517039f1}}</ref>\n*2013: \"La noche de los muertos vivientes\" (single) by Lantana: producer, musician, mixing and mastering\n*2008: ''Into The Clouds'' by Hotel Persona: producer \n*2007: \"Siempre \u2013 Hotel Persona\" (remix) by Lantana: remixer\n\n==Remixes== \n*Lantana \"Siempre\" Hotel Persona Remix\n*She Wants Revenge \"I Want To Tear You Apart\" Hotel Persona Remix\n*Placebo \"[[Infra-Red (song)|Infra-Red]]\" Hotel Persona Remix\n*Placebo \"I Do\" (Material Mix) Remix (Placebo \u2013 I Do (Material Mix) (Once More With Feeling (Singles 1996\u20132004) Mexican Limited Edition Album)\n\n==Equipment==\nOlsdal uses a variety of instruments, including a Gibson Thunderbird (three: one vintage used since 2003, one modern black which replaced the Flying V in 2006 and one white used since 2009), Fender Jazz Bass, Fender Bass VI, Gibson Les Paul Custom and a Gretsch Anniversary. In live versions of \"[[Teenage Angst (song)|Teenage Angst]]\", \"Centrefolds\" and most acoustic performances he used a Technics keyboard. During the ''[[Meds]]'' era, he also used an Epiphone Flying V Bass for live performances of \"[[Nancy Boy]]\", \"[[Come Home (Placebo song)|Come Home]]\" and other occasional songs (mostly rarely played songs from the first album), which appeared on the \"[[Infra-Red (song)|Infra-Red]]\" video, although this guitar was smashed by Olsdal at the end of their 2006 [[Reading Festival]] set. He is seen playing an olympic white [[Fender Jaguar Bass]] in the \"[[For What It's Worth (Placebo song)|For What It's Worth]]\" video, and played a white [[Rickenbacker]] bass in live performance on television programs. He has also been playing a Charger bass, built by the luthiers TAO Guitars in Brussels.\n\nHis amplification is a mixture of [[Ampeg]] (for basses) and [[Marshall Amplification|Marshall]] (for guitars) amplifiers. He also played the [[xylophone]] in acoustic performances of some songs from ''Meds'' (\"Pierrot The Clown\", \"Post Blue\").

The likelihood-ratio test rejects the null hypothesis if the value of this statistic is too small. How small is too small depends on the significance level of the test, i.e. on what probability of [[Type&nbsp;I error]] is considered tolerable (Type&nbsp;I errors consist of the rejection of a null hypothesis that is true).\n\nThe [[numerator]] corresponds to the likelihood of an observed outcome under the [[null hypothesis]]. The [[denominator]] corresponds to the maximum likelihood of an observed outcome, varying parameters over the whole parameter space. The numerator of this ratio is less than the denominator; so, the likelihood ratio is between 0 and 1. Low values of the likelihood ratio mean that the observed result was much less likely to occur under the null hypothesis as compared to the alternative. High values of the statistic mean that the observed outcome was nearly as likely to occur under the null hypothesis as the alternative, and so the null hypothesis cannot be rejected.\n\n===An example===\nThe following example is adapted and abridged from {{Harvtxt|Stuart|Ord|Arnold||1999|loc=\u00a722.2}}.\n\nSuppose that we have a random sample, of size {{mvar|n}}, from a population that is normally-distributed. Both the mean, {{mvar|&mu;}}, and the standard deviation, {{mvar|&sigma;}}, of the population are unknown. We want to test whether the mean is equal to a given value, {{math|''&mu;''{{sub|0}} }}. \n\nThus, our null hypothesis is {{math|''H''{{sub|0}}:&nbsp; ''&mu;'' {{=}} ''&mu;''{{sub|0}}&nbsp;}} and our alternative hypothesis is {{math|''H''{{sub|1}}:&nbsp; ''&mu;'' \u2260 ''&mu;''{{sub|0}}&nbsp;}}. The likelihood function is \n:<math>\\mathcal{L}(\\mu,\\sigma \\mid x) = \\left(2\\pi\\sigma^2\\right)^{-n/2} \\exp\\left( -\\sum_{i=1}^n \\frac{(x_i -\\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right)\\,.</math>\n\nWith some calculation (omitted here), it can then be shown that \n:<math>\\lambda = \\left(1 + \\frac{t^2}{n-1}\\right)^{-n/2} </math> \nwhere {{mvar|t}} is the [[t-statistic|{{mvar|t}}-statistic]] with {{math|''n''&thinsp;&minus;&thinsp;1}} degrees of freedom. Hence we may use the known exact distribution of {{math|''t''{{sub|''n''&minus;1}}}} to draw inferences.\n\n==Asymptotic distribution: Wilks\u2019 theorem==\n{{Main|Wilks' theorem}}\n\nIf the distribution of the likelihood ratio corresponding to a particular null and alternative hypothesis can be explicitly determined then it can directly be used to form decision regions (to sustain or reject the null hypothesis). In most cases, however, the exact distribution of the likelihood ratio corresponding to specific hypotheses is very difficult to determine.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\nAssuming {{math|''H''<sub>0</sub>}} is true, there is a fundamental result by [[Samuel S.

The likelihood-ratio test rejects the null hypothesis if the value of this statistic is too small. How small is too small depends on the significance level of the test, i.e. on what probability of [[Type&nbsp;I error]] is considered tolerable (Type&nbsp;I errors consist of the rejection of a null hypothesis that is true).\n\nThe [[numerator]] corresponds to the likelihood of an observed outcome under the [[null hypothesis]]. The [[denominator]] corresponds to the maximum likelihood of an observed outcome, varying parameters over the whole parameter space. The numerator of this ratio is less than the denominator; so, the likelihood ratio is between 0 and 1. Low values of the likelihood ratio mean that the observed result was much less likely to occur under the null hypothesis as compared to the alternative. High values of the statistic mean that the observed outcome was nearly as likely to occur under the null hypothesis as the alternative, and so the null hypothesis cannot be rejected.\n\n===An example===\nThe following example is adapted and abridged from {{Harvtxt|Stuart|Ord|Arnold||1999|loc=\u00a722.2}}.\n\nSuppose that we have a random sample, of size {{mvar|n}}, from a population that is normally-distributed. Both the mean, {{mvar|&mu;}}, and the standard deviation, {{mvar|&sigma;}}, of the population are unknown. We want to test whether the mean is equal to a given value, {{math|''&mu;''{{sub|0}} }}. \n\nThus, our null hypothesis is {{math|''H''{{sub|0}}:&nbsp; ''&mu;'' {{=}} ''&mu;''{{sub|0}}&nbsp;}} and our alternative hypothesis is {{math|''H''{{sub|1}}:&nbsp; ''&mu;'' \u2260 ''&mu;''{{sub|0}}&nbsp;}}. The likelihood function is \n:<math>\\mathcal{L}(\\mu,\\sigma \\mid x) = \\left(2\\pi\\sigma^2\\right)^{-n/2} \\exp\\left( -\\sum_{i=1}^n \\frac{(x_i -\\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right)\\,.</math>\n\nWith some calculation (omitted here), it can then be shown that \n:<math>\\lambda = \\left(1 + \\frac{t^2}{n-1}\\right)^{-n/2} </math> \nwhere {{mvar|t}} is the [[t-statistic|{{mvar|t}}-statistic]] with {{math|''n''&thinsp;&minus;&thinsp;1}} degrees of freedom. Hence we may use the known exact distribution of {{math|''t''{{sub|''n''&minus;1}}}} to draw inferences.\n\n==Asymptotic distribution: Wilks\u2019 theorem==\n{{Main|Wilks' theorem}}\n\nIf the distribution of the likelihood ratio corresponding to a particular null and alternative hypothesis can be explicitly determined then it can directly be used to form decision regions (to sustain or reject the null hypothesis). In most cases, however, the exact distribution of the likelihood ratio corresponding to specific hypotheses is very difficult to determine.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\nAssuming {{math|''H''<sub>0</sub>}} is true, there is a fundamental result by [[Samuel S. Wilks]]: As the sample size <math>n</math> approaches [[Infinity|<math>\\infty</math>]], the test statistic <math>-2 \\log(\\lambda)</math> [[Asymptotic theory (statistics)|asymptotically]] will be [[chi-squared distribution|chi-squared distributed]] (<math>\\chi^2</math>) with [[degrees of freedom (statistics)|degrees of freedom]] equal to the difference in dimensionality of <math>\\Theta</math> and <math>\\Theta_0</math>.<ref>{{citation | last1 = Wilks | first1 = S.
