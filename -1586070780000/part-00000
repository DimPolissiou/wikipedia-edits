The band consists of 3 members: [[Fyfe Dangerfield]], Aristazabal Hawkes and Greig Stewart. [[MC Lord Magr\u00e3o]] was formerly a member, but, left the band in June 2013.\n\nThe band was formed and is based in London,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wrasserecords.com/Guillemots_159/biography.html|title=Guillemots Biography|publisher=wrasserecords.com}}</ref> however, the members are from England, Scotland, Brazil and Canada. Their first album, ''[[Through the Windowpane]]'', was nominated for a [[Mercury Music Prize]] in 2006. The band experienced some chart success, with their single \"[[Get Over It (Guillemots song)|Get Over It]]\" reaching number 20 in the [[UK Singles Chart]], in March 2008. Their second album, ''[[Red (Guillemots album)|Red]]'', reached number 9 in the [[UK Albums Chart]] in the same month. After touring throughout 2008 and Dangerfield releasing a solo record, the band released their third record, ''[[Walk the River]],'' on 18 April 2011. The band's fourth album, ''[[Hello Land!]],'' was released 7 May 2012.\n\n==History==\n\n===Formation and early years (2004\u20132006)===\n[[Fyfe Dangerfield]] began writing songs in his native [[Birmingham]] and then in Bromsgrove. His early band, [[Senseless Prayer]], recorded a session for [[John Peel]]'s [[BBC Radio 1|Radio 1]] show in 1999. Dangerfield then began song writing under the name \"Fyfe Dangerfield and the Accident\", and in 2004 he featured alongside [[Misty's Big Adventure]], Mike in Mono, Dreams of Tall Buildings, and X Is Greater Than Y on a promotional CD that was offered free with ''[[Birmingham Post|The Birmingham Post]]'', called ''Broader Than Broad Street''. He then joined old school friend, Paul \"Booby\" Tooby, on his \"Ragamuffin Blues but Holes in my Shoes\" tour.\n\nDangerfield had moved to [[Bromsgrove]], attending [[Bromsgrove School]] in 1988; he moved to London in 2002, where he recruited the current line-up (although Alex Ward was also at Bromsgrove School). He also became a maverick music teacher for [[Cranbrook College]].\n\n[[File:Guillemots1.jpg|thumb|left|Fyfe during a performance in 2005.]]The name of the band is the plural of the name of a group of [[seabirds]] (but most often meaning the [[common guillemot]], ''Uria aalge'') and should be pronounced 'gillimott' (and not with a French accent). The 4-piece have often been joined by two saxophone and woodwind players, Alex Ward and Chris Cundy, who are known as the \"Bridled Guillemots\" (a real-life variation of the band's namesake). Guillemots often use quirky musical instruments, such as the sound of a [[typewriter]] in the song \"Who Left The Lights Off, Baby?\", and MC Lord Magrao has used industrial power tools to create new sounds on their records.\n\nDangerfield, Ward and Cundy are also founding members of the jazz ensemble Gannets.<ref>{{cite web|author=Un |url=http://www.myspace.com/gannets |title=gaNNets &#124; Gratis muziek, tourneedata, foto's, video's |publisher=Myspace.com |accessdate=13 October 2012}}{{Primary source inline|date=January 2020}}</ref>\n\nBirds are the source of inspiration for the band not just in name. For example, their 2006 EP ''[[From the Cliffs]]'' continues the Guillemot theme, the bird's natural habitat being steep sea cliffs.  In their [[MySpace]] entry their influences are given as 'BIRDSONG first and foremost', although the only artist that all the band members have publicly stated as being an influence is [[Bj\u00f6rk]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.glastonburyfestivals.co.uk/news.aspx?id=619 |title=News \u2013 Myhab 2011 |publisher=Glastonbury Festivals |accessdate=13 October 2012}}</ref> Their first album features recordings of [[red-throated diver]] (''Gavia stellata'') and [[European robin]] (''Erithacus rubecula''), as well as the line 'flitting like a [[Old World flycatcher|flycatcher]]', a reference to the mercurial movements of these birds, and the song \"Redwings\", after the thrush species of the same name. In June 2007, the band appeared on the [[BBC Four]] documentary, ''Why Birds Sing'', contributing their musical talents to a Birdsong-inspired collaboration called \"The Twitch\".\n\nThe band were initially signed to [[Fantastic Plastic Records|Fantastic Plastic]], who released their debut album in 2006, but after offers from several majors they eventually moved to Polydor.\n\nThe band released their debut EP, ''I Saw Such Things in My Sleep'', in September 2005, all 1000 copies sold out on the day of release.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theindiemusicdb.com/bio.php?artist=47 |title=The Indie Music Database : gUiLLeMoTs \u2013 Bio |publisher=Theindiemusicdb.com |accessdate=13 October 2012}}</ref> The band ended a very successful 2005 opening for [[Rufus Wainwright]]'s sold-out UK tour and began 2006 by being awarded fifth place in the [[BBC]] [[Sound of 2006]]<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4514016.stm |title=Entertainment &#124; Sound of 2006: The Top 10 |publisher=BBC News |date=6 January 2006 |accessdate=13 October 2012}}</ref> survey. The single \"We're Here\" was named \"Single of the Week\" on the Jungalist website on 27 March 2006, and on 19 June 2006 they played their first ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' performance to promote their third single \"[[Made-Up Lovesong 43|Made-Up Lovesong No.&nbsp;43]]\". It was a memorable show: guitarist MC Lord Magrao played his guitar to a set of mirrors, reflecting his performance back to the crowd.\n\n===''Through The Windowpane'' (2006\u20132008)===\nGuillemots' debut album, ''[[Through the Windowpane]]'' was released on 10 July and reached number 17 in the album chart. The album's release date was timed so it would be eligible for the 2006 [[Mercury Music Prize]], and the album did make the shortlist, but lost out to [[Arctic Monkeys]]' debut ''[[Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not]]''. It received a good deal of critical acclaim on its release, scoring an average of 81% on metacritic.com's overview of the critical response.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/music/artists/guillemots/throughthewindowpane?q=guillemots |title=Through The Windowpane Reviews, Ratings, Credits, and More |publisher=Metacritic |date=10 July 2006 |accessdate=13 October 2012}}</ref> During [[Paul McCartney]]'s \"Radio 1 Legends\" show, celebrating the 40th anniversary of the station, he played some of his favorite songs. One of those was the song \"[[Little Bear (song)|Little Bear]]\", which he called \"a very brave way to open an album\". He stated his admiration for the track's \"beautiful orchestration\".\n\nDuring the recording sessions for the album, the band recorded an EP entitled ''Of The Night'' made up of one song written by each band member. It was released via the internet on Valentine's Day 2006 and performed live in its entirety at the BBC Electric Proms 2006, with the BBC Concert Orchestra. Their performance of Bad Boyfriend was particularly memorable for the band donning animal masks, and Fyfe crying \"Take me to orchestral paradise!\" before the song's orchestral culmination. The EP was eventually released on CD and LP in November, to independent music shops only. \"[[Trains To Brazil]]\" was promoted in September 2006 and was given out as \"Single of the Week\" on [[iTunes]], as their fourth (second chart-eligible) single; a new version of \"[[Annie, Let's Not Wait]]\" was released as their next single, on 15 January 2007.\n\n===''Red'' and brief hiatus (2008\u20132010)===\nTheir second album, ''[[Red (Guillemots album)|Red]]'' was released on 24 March 2008.,<ref>[https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0011648ZU]{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> preceded by the single \"[[Get Over It (Guillemots song)|Get Over It]]\" on 17 March \"Get Over It\" became Guillemots' highest placed single, reaching number 20 in the [[UK Singles Chart]], while ''Red'' reached number 9 in the [[UK Albums Chart]]. The album developed with a seemingly different style for each track and one reviewer compared it to \"being like a \u2018That's What I Call Music\u2019 collection except it is all by one band and the quality is better than the average pop collection.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.music-news.com/ShowReview.asp?nReviewID=3130&nType=1 |title=Guillemots \u2013 Red |publisher=Music-News.com |date=29 January 2009 |accessdate=13 October 2012}}</ref> The band then toured extensively throughout 2008, concluding with a much celebrated final UK tour entitled ''Fishbone for a Drink Tour''.\n\nIn an interview on late 2008 Fyfe told the reporter: \"It\u2019s good \u2013 it feels like the end of the first phase of the band.\" <ref>{{cite web|author=Terry Grimley |url=http://www.birminghampost.net/life-leisure-birmingham-guide/birmingham-culture/music-in-birmingham/2008/10/27/fyfe-and-his-guillemots-starting-over-65233-22127214/ |title=Life & Leisure \u2013 Birmingham Culture \u2013 Music \u2013 Fyfe and his Guillemots starting over |work=Birmingham Post |accessdate=13 October 2012}}</ref>\n\nAfter this the band went into a hiatus. Fyfe released his first solo album, ''[[Fly Yellow Moon]]'' in January 2010. He toured the record while together with the band and many feared that Fyfe's success as solo artist could spell the end for Guillemots. Fyfe has since revealed that the band were still in contact and later writing together while he was promoting his solo album. On 18 June 2009, a post appeared on the Guillemots' official website stating that work had commenced on their third album. The band started rehearsing again in May 2010 following Fyfe's solo work and resumed recording on 7 June. The group finally finished the recording of a new album around the summer/autumn of 2010.\n\n===''Walk the River'' (2010\u20132011)===\nIn October Fyfe announced via Twitter that the album was finished, with mastering and final touches supposedly done in November. By December, a message appeared on the band's site informing of the imminent news with a countdown for 13 January, when it was revealed that a secret gig on an unknown location would occur on 27 January with clues for the venue before the date. Tickets sold out in 4 minutes.\n\nTheir third album ''[[Walk the River]]'' was released on 18 April 2011. The album was preceded by the single \"The Basket\", which was perceived as being more like the material on Red, though the rest of Walk the River can be better compared to Through the Windowpane. Upon the release of the album fans were able to purchase a limited amount of the new album that were signed exclusively by the band. Fyfe and Greig performed a memorable rendition of another single from the album, \"I Don't Feel Amazing Now\", in a little woodland by a disused railway line in North London for WatchListenTell.\n<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_G5p7PtoFs |title=WLT \u2013 Guillemots \u2013 I Don't Feel Amazing Now |via=YouTube |accessdate=13 October 2012}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the album's release they did a series of secret gigs at Birmingham, London, Manchester and Glasgow. The Guillemots then played sets at different festivals in the UK and Europe throughout the summer of 2011. In September the group commenced a tour of Europe, before playing four shows in Brazil and Argentina during October.<ref>[http://www.guillemots.com/news.php?id=guillemots-have-confirmed-four-shows-in-brazi ]{{dead link|date=October 2012}}</ref> They then returned to perform dates in the UK during October and November, with the show at the Stanley Theatre, Liverpool proving a real highlight. In Liverpool there was a performance of new song \"Southern Winds\" and during the song \"[[Falling Out of Reach]]\", the band managed to keep on playing after a local man shouted out \"calm down\" after Fyfe had just sung \"calm down\", although the crowd were in hysterics.\n\n===''Hello Land!'' (2012\u2013present)===\nIn January 2012, Fyfe revealed the band had written a lot of new material and was currently recording a new album, while new songs were played at their UK shows.<ref>[http://www.liverpool-live.info/interviews/interview-guillemots-nov-2011 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111215093856/http://www.liverpool-live.info/interviews/interview-guillemots-nov-2011 |date=15 December 2011 }}</ref> On 7 May, the band announced through their website that they would be releasing four new albums throughout 2012, under the project title ''The Emporium of Fine Things''. The first, ''[[Hello Land!]]'' coming out the same day on CD and download. The albums will be released in partnership with The state51 Conspiracy and will come out in relation to the seasons. The band admitted that ''Hello Land!'', the spring-themed album, had come out a little late. The summer record was tentatively titled ''On Summer Island'', and was due in September 2012 but has yet to be released. In April 2013 Fyfe Dangerfield posted an apology stating that he had been back and forth between the UK and Norway where the album was being recorded but was very excited about the project and hoped it would be completed soon. It is still the band's intention that they release the series of four albums but they had obviously not been able to achieve this in one year as they had originally intended.\n\n==Live performances==\nGuillemots have made numerous live performances since they first appeared in the music world in 2004.\nTheir first full scale UK tour began in April 2006. After a brief period putting the finishing touches to their debut album, and performing a set for [[Gideon Coe]]'s [[BBC 6 Music]] show in June, they began the second leg of dates in October, which ran until early November.\n\nOne of their most notable live performances to date came in October 2006 at the first [[BBC Electric Proms]] when the band performed 7 tracks with a full orchestra, with songs transcribed and arranged for such a performance by Dangerfield himself. This included a rare performance of the song \"Bad Boyfriend\" where the entire band donned animal masks.\n\n[[File:Guillemots live2.jpg|thumb|Guillemots at Lovebox Weekender festival. London, July 2006.|alt=|300x300px]]\n\nSupport on Guillemots' tours is often varied, usually with two support acts for each show \u2013 one main support who stay with them for the majority of the tours' dates ([[Misty's Big Adventure]] in early 2006 and [[The Last Town Chorus]] for their autumn tour), as well as a first support act, specific to the location. Another common support/friend of the band is [[Joan as Police Woman]], who the band met while performing as support for [[Rufus Wainwright]]. In 2006 they did a ''Take-Away Show'' video session shot by [[Vincent Moon]].\n\nGuillemots have also performed live with political songwriter [[Get Cape. Wear Cape. Fly]] and supported [[Snow Patrol]] at [[Wembley Arena]] in December 2006, in a performance culminating in a [[lightsaber]] duel between the band's tour manager, and MC's guitar tech, on stage as Dangerfield played percussion on a tray.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MY_y0t_ItA |title=Archived copy |accessdate=25 November 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160615012345/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MY_y0t_ItA |archivedate=15 June 2016  }}</ref>\n\nThe band appeared at the [[V Festival]] both in 2007 and in 2008. They played Marlay Park on 25 August 2007 as one of the support acts to Damien Rice.\n\nGuillemots, along with [[Sons and Daughters (band)|Sons and Daughters]] supported [[KT Tunstall]] at the 2008 Eden Sessions, held at the [[Eden Project]]. The band played a free concert in [[Huddersfield]] on 29 June 2008, along with [[Elliot Minor]] and [[The Script]]. They also played a set on the O2 Wireless Main Stage in London's [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]] on 4 July 2008, supporting acts such as [[The Wombats]], [[Dirty Pretty Things (band)|Dirty Pretty Things]], [[Beck]] and [[Morrissey]].\n\nThey performed the Uncut Arena at the 2008 [[Latitude Festival]] on Saturday 19 July; in addition to this, they also played a live set to a screening of [[David Lynch]]'s film ''[[Eraserhead]]'' at the Music & Film Arena on the preceding Friday. The band performed as the first warm-up act, followed by [[Editors (band)|Editors]], for [[R.E.M.]] on 27 August 2008 at the [[Southampton]] [[Rose Bowl, Hampshire|Rose Bowl]].\n\nIn June 2008, Guillemots had their Kentish Town Forum gig filmed and later broadcast on [[Channel Bee|Channelbee]].\n\nIn July 2008 they played an improvised set to a screening of [[David Lynch]]'s ''[[Eraserhead]]'' on the [[Latitude Festival]].\n\nIn September 2008, they played at the 2008 Orange RockCorps Gig in the [[Royal Albert Hall]], some of which was broadcast on [[T4 (Channel 4)|T4]].\n\nOn 5 September 2008 they played a gig supporting Travis at The Quarry in Shrewsbury, Shropshire. Miles Hammond, a local 12-year-old who had posted a YouTube video showing how to play the intro to 'Kriss Kross'<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icznuaEA8bo&list=LLS5gqphjcjJJOIU_dah2woA] {{dead link|date=March 2020}}</ref>, was invited on stage to play the intro to the song at the gig.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnotXbPXDCU&list=LLS5gqphjcjJJOIU_dah2woA] {{dead link|date=March 2020}}</ref> He and his 13-year-old brother Lewis Hammond were also invited back on stage to play percussion, including scaffolding components, in 'S\u00e3o Paulo', the last song in their set that night.\n\nIn December 2008, they played an exclusive impromptu Super Busking gig in London's Covent Garden as part of Covent Garden's Christmas Delight celebrations. The performance took place in-sync with a visual light display by [[United Visual Artists]] in aid of homeless charity Crisis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.coventgardenlondonuk.com |title=Covent Garden London Official Guide |publisher=Coventgardenlondonuk.com |accessdate=13 October 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn February 2009, they played themselves and performed one of their songs in the episode \"Last Night a DJ Saved My Life\" of the TV series ''[[FM (TV series)|FM]]''.\n\nOn 13 April 2012, it was announced the band would headline the Saturday of the 2012 2000Trees Festival in Gloucestershire.\n\n==Members==\n*[[Fyfe Dangerfield]] (also known as Fyfe Antony Dangerfield Hutchins) \u2013 singer, keyboard and guitar\n*[[MC Lord Magr\u00e3o]] \u2013 guitar, bass guitar, [[mandolin]], [[accordion]], [[xylophone]], [[theremin]], [[synth bass]], [[typewriter]], [[musical saw]], [[electric drill]], [[melodica]], [[Melodeon (organ)|melodeon]]\n*[[Aristazabal Hawkes]] \u2013 double bass and percussion\n*Greig Stewart (also known as Rican Caol) \u2013 drums and percussion\n\n===The \"Bridled\" Guillemots===\n*Alex J.

The band consists of 3 members: [[Fyfe Dangerfield]], Aristazabal Hawkes and Greig Stewart. Past members include [[MC Lord Magr\u00e3o]], who left the band in June 2013.\n\nFormed and based in London,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wrasserecords.com/Guillemots_159/biography.html|title=Guillemots Biography|publisher=wrasserecords.com}}</ref> the band's members have been compiled from England, Scotland, Brazil and Canada. Their first album, ''[[Through the Windowpane]]'', was nominated for the 2006 [[Mercury Music Prize]]. The band has experienced some chart success, with their single \"[[Get Over It (Guillemots song)|Get Over It]]\" reaching number 20 in the [[UK Singles Chart]] in March 2008. Their second album, ''[[Red (Guillemots album)|Red]]'', reached number 9 in the [[UK Albums Chart]] in the same month. After touring all through 2008 and Fyfe releasing a solo record the band finished their third record ''[[Walk the River]]'' released on 18 April 2011. The band's fourth album ''[[Hello Land!]]'' was released 7 May 2012.\n\n==History==\n\n===Formation and early years (2004\u20132006)===\n[[Fyfe Dangerfield]] began writing songs in his native [[Birmingham]] and then in Bromsgrove. His early band, [[Senseless Prayer]], recorded a session for [[John Peel]]'s [[BBC Radio 1|Radio 1]] show in 1999. Dangerfield then began song writing under the name \"Fyfe Dangerfield and the Accident\", and in 2004 he featured alongside [[Misty's Big Adventure]], Mike in Mono, Dreams of Tall Buildings, and X Is Greater Than Y on a promotional CD that was offered free with ''[[Birmingham Post|The Birmingham Post]]'', called ''Broader Than Broad Street''. He then joined old school friend, Paul \"Booby\" Tooby, on his \"Ragamuffin Blues but Holes in my Shoes\" tour.\n\nDangerfield had moved to [[Bromsgrove]], attending [[Bromsgrove School]] in 1988; he moved to London in 2002, where he recruited the current line-up (although Alex Ward was also at Bromsgrove School). He also became a maverick music teacher for [[Cranbrook College]].\n\n[[File:Guillemots1.jpg|thumb|left|Fyfe during a performance in 2005.]]The name of the band is the plural of the name of a group of [[seabirds]] (but most often meaning the [[common guillemot]], ''Uria aalge'') and should be pronounced 'gillimott' (and not with a French accent). The 4-piece have often been joined by two saxophone and woodwind players, Alex Ward and Chris Cundy, who are known as the \"Bridled Guillemots\" (a real-life variation of the band's namesake). Guillemots often use quirky musical instruments, such as the sound of a [[typewriter]] in the song \"Who Left The Lights Off, Baby?\", and MC Lord Magrao has used industrial power tools to create new sounds on their records.\n\nDangerfield, Ward and Cundy are also founding members of the jazz ensemble Gannets.<ref>{{cite web|author=Un |url=http://www.myspace.com/gannets |title=gaNNets &#124; Gratis muziek, tourneedata, foto's, video's |publisher=Myspace.com |accessdate=13 October 2012}}{{Primary source inline|date=January 2020}}</ref>\n\nBirds are the source of inspiration for the band not just in name. For example, their 2006 EP ''[[From the Cliffs]]'' continues the Guillemot theme, the bird's natural habitat being steep sea cliffs.  In their [[MySpace]] entry their influences are given as 'BIRDSONG first and foremost', although the only artist that all the band members have publicly stated as being an influence is [[Bj\u00f6rk]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.glastonburyfestivals.co.uk/news.aspx?id=619 |title=News \u2013 Myhab 2011 |publisher=Glastonbury Festivals |accessdate=13 October 2012}}</ref> Their first album features recordings of [[red-throated diver]] (''Gavia stellata'') and [[European robin]] (''Erithacus rubecula''), as well as the line 'flitting like a [[Old World flycatcher|flycatcher]]', a reference to the mercurial movements of these birds, and the song \"Redwings\", after the thrush species of the same name. In June 2007, the band appeared on the [[BBC Four]] documentary, ''Why Birds Sing'', contributing their musical talents to a Birdsong-inspired collaboration called \"The Twitch\".\n\nThe band were initially signed to [[Fantastic Plastic Records|Fantastic Plastic]], who released their debut album in 2006, but after offers from several majors they eventually moved to Polydor.\n\nThe band released their debut EP, ''I Saw Such Things in My Sleep'', in September 2005, all 1000 copies sold out on the day of release.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theindiemusicdb.com/bio.php?artist=47 |title=The Indie Music Database : gUiLLeMoTs \u2013 Bio |publisher=Theindiemusicdb.com |accessdate=13 October 2012}}</ref> The band ended a very successful 2005 opening for [[Rufus Wainwright]]'s sold-out UK tour and began 2006 by being awarded fifth place in the [[BBC]] [[Sound of 2006]]<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4514016.stm |title=Entertainment &#124; Sound of 2006: The Top 10 |publisher=BBC News |date=6 January 2006 |accessdate=13 October 2012}}</ref> survey. The single \"We're Here\" was named \"Single of the Week\" on the Jungalist website on 27 March 2006, and on 19 June 2006 they played their first ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' performance to promote their third single \"[[Made-Up Lovesong 43|Made-Up Lovesong No.&nbsp;43]]\". It was a memorable show: guitarist MC Lord Magrao played his guitar to a set of mirrors, reflecting his performance back to the crowd.\n\n===''Through The Windowpane'' (2006\u20132008)===\nGuillemots' debut album, ''[[Through the Windowpane]]'' was released on 10 July and reached number 17 in the album chart. The album's release date was timed so it would be eligible for the 2006 [[Mercury Music Prize]], and the album did make the shortlist, but lost out to [[Arctic Monkeys]]' debut ''[[Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not]]''. It received a good deal of critical acclaim on its release, scoring an average of 81% on metacritic.com's overview of the critical response.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/music/artists/guillemots/throughthewindowpane?q=guillemots |title=Through The Windowpane Reviews, Ratings, Credits, and More |publisher=Metacritic |date=10 July 2006 |accessdate=13 October 2012}}</ref> During [[Paul McCartney]]'s \"Radio 1 Legends\" show, celebrating the 40th anniversary of the station, he played some of his favorite songs. One of those was the song \"[[Little Bear (song)|Little Bear]]\", which he called \"a very brave way to open an album\". He stated his admiration for the track's \"beautiful orchestration\".\n\nDuring the recording sessions for the album, the band recorded an EP entitled ''Of The Night'' made up of one song written by each band member. It was released via the internet on Valentine's Day 2006 and performed live in its entirety at the BBC Electric Proms 2006, with the BBC Concert Orchestra. Their performance of Bad Boyfriend was particularly memorable for the band donning animal masks, and Fyfe crying \"Take me to orchestral paradise!\" before the song's orchestral culmination. The EP was eventually released on CD and LP in November, to independent music shops only. \"[[Trains To Brazil]]\" was promoted in September 2006 and was given out as \"Single of the Week\" on [[iTunes]], as their fourth (second chart-eligible) single; a new version of \"[[Annie, Let's Not Wait]]\" was released as their next single, on 15 January 2007.\n\n===''Red'' and brief hiatus (2008\u20132010)===\nTheir second album, ''[[Red (Guillemots album)|Red]]'' was released on 24 March 2008.,<ref>[https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0011648ZU]{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> preceded by the single \"[[Get Over It (Guillemots song)|Get Over It]]\" on 17 March \"Get Over It\" became Guillemots' highest placed single, reaching number 20 in the [[UK Singles Chart]], while ''Red'' reached number 9 in the [[UK Albums Chart]]. The album developed with a seemingly different style for each track and one reviewer compared it to \"being like a \u2018That's What I Call Music\u2019 collection except it is all by one band and the quality is better than the average pop collection.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.music-news.com/ShowReview.asp?nReviewID=3130&nType=1 |title=Guillemots \u2013 Red |publisher=Music-News.com |date=29 January 2009 |accessdate=13 October 2012}}</ref> The band then toured extensively throughout 2008, concluding with a much celebrated final UK tour entitled ''Fishbone for a Drink Tour''.\n\nIn an interview on late 2008 Fyfe told the reporter: \"It\u2019s good \u2013 it feels like the end of the first phase of the band.\" <ref>{{cite web|author=Terry Grimley |url=http://www.birminghampost.net/life-leisure-birmingham-guide/birmingham-culture/music-in-birmingham/2008/10/27/fyfe-and-his-guillemots-starting-over-65233-22127214/ |title=Life & Leisure \u2013 Birmingham Culture \u2013 Music \u2013 Fyfe and his Guillemots starting over |work=Birmingham Post |accessdate=13 October 2012}}</ref>\n\nAfter this the band went into a hiatus. Fyfe released his first solo album, ''[[Fly Yellow Moon]]'' in January 2010. He toured the record while together with the band and many feared that Fyfe's success as solo artist could spell the end for Guillemots. Fyfe has since revealed that the band were still in contact and later writing together while he was promoting his solo album. On 18 June 2009, a post appeared on the Guillemots' official website stating that work had commenced on their third album. The band started rehearsing again in May 2010 following Fyfe's solo work and resumed recording on 7 June. The group finally finished the recording of a new album around the summer/autumn of 2010.\n\n===''Walk the River'' (2010\u20132011)===\nIn October Fyfe announced via Twitter that the album was finished, with mastering and final touches supposedly done in November. By December, a message appeared on the band's site informing of the imminent news with a countdown for 13 January, when it was revealed that a secret gig on an unknown location would occur on 27 January with clues for the venue before the date. Tickets sold out in 4 minutes.\n\nTheir third album ''[[Walk the River]]'' was released on 18 April 2011. The album was preceded by the single \"The Basket\", which was perceived as being more like the material on Red, though the rest of Walk the River can be better compared to Through the Windowpane. Upon the release of the album fans were able to purchase a limited amount of the new album that were signed exclusively by the band. Fyfe and Greig performed a memorable rendition of another single from the album, \"I Don't Feel Amazing Now\", in a little woodland by a disused railway line in North London for WatchListenTell.\n<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_G5p7PtoFs |title=WLT \u2013 Guillemots \u2013 I Don't Feel Amazing Now |via=YouTube |accessdate=13 October 2012}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the album's release they did a series of secret gigs at Birmingham, London, Manchester and Glasgow. The Guillemots then played sets at different festivals in the UK and Europe throughout the summer of 2011. In September the group commenced a tour of Europe, before playing four shows in Brazil and Argentina during October.<ref>[http://www.guillemots.com/news.php?id=guillemots-have-confirmed-four-shows-in-brazi ]{{dead link|date=October 2012}}</ref> They then returned to perform dates in the UK during October and November, with the show at the Stanley Theatre, Liverpool proving a real highlight. In Liverpool there was a performance of new song \"Southern Winds\" and during the song \"[[Falling Out of Reach]]\", the band managed to keep on playing after a local man shouted out \"calm down\" after Fyfe had just sung \"calm down\", although the crowd were in hysterics.\n\n===''Hello Land!'' (2012\u2013present)===\nIn January 2012, Fyfe revealed the band had written a lot of new material and was currently recording a new album, while new songs were played at their UK shows.<ref>[http://www.liverpool-live.info/interviews/interview-guillemots-nov-2011 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111215093856/http://www.liverpool-live.info/interviews/interview-guillemots-nov-2011 |date=15 December 2011 }}</ref> On 7 May, the band announced through their website that they would be releasing four new albums throughout 2012, under the project title ''The Emporium of Fine Things''. The first, ''[[Hello Land!]]'' coming out the same day on CD and download. The albums will be released in partnership with The state51 Conspiracy and will come out in relation to the seasons. The band admitted that ''Hello Land!'', the spring-themed album, had come out a little late. The summer record was tentatively titled ''On Summer Island'', and was due in September 2012 but has yet to be released. In April 2013 Fyfe Dangerfield posted an apology stating that he had been back and forth between the UK and Norway where the album was being recorded but was very excited about the project and hoped it would be completed soon. It is still the band's intention that they release the series of four albums but they had obviously not been able to achieve this in one year as they had originally intended.\n\n==Live performances==\nGuillemots have made numerous live performances since they first appeared in the music world in 2004.\nTheir first full scale UK tour began in April 2006. After a brief period putting the finishing touches to their debut album, and performing a set for [[Gideon Coe]]'s [[BBC 6 Music]] show in June, they began the second leg of dates in October, which ran until early November.\n\nOne of their most notable live performances to date came in October 2006 at the first [[BBC Electric Proms]] when the band performed 7 tracks with a full orchestra, with songs transcribed and arranged for such a performance by Dangerfield himself. This included a rare performance of the song \"Bad Boyfriend\" where the entire band donned animal masks.\n\n[[File:Guillemots live2.jpg|thumb|Guillemots at Lovebox Weekender festival. London, July 2006.|alt=|300x300px]]\n\nSupport on Guillemots' tours is often varied, usually with two support acts for each show \u2013 one main support who stay with them for the majority of the tours' dates ([[Misty's Big Adventure]] in early 2006 and [[The Last Town Chorus]] for their autumn tour), as well as a first support act, specific to the location. Another common support/friend of the band is [[Joan as Police Woman]], who the band met while performing as support for [[Rufus Wainwright]]. In 2006 they did a ''Take-Away Show'' video session shot by [[Vincent Moon]].\n\nGuillemots have also performed live with political songwriter [[Get Cape. Wear Cape. Fly]] and supported [[Snow Patrol]] at [[Wembley Arena]] in December 2006, in a performance culminating in a [[lightsaber]] duel between the band's tour manager, and MC's guitar tech, on stage as Dangerfield played percussion on a tray.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MY_y0t_ItA |title=Archived copy |accessdate=25 November 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160615012345/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MY_y0t_ItA |archivedate=15 June 2016  }}</ref>\n\nThe band appeared at the [[V Festival]] both in 2007 and in 2008. They played Marlay Park on 25 August 2007 as one of the support acts to Damien Rice.\n\nGuillemots, along with [[Sons and Daughters (band)|Sons and Daughters]] supported [[KT Tunstall]] at the 2008 Eden Sessions, held at the [[Eden Project]]. The band played a free concert in [[Huddersfield]] on 29 June 2008, along with [[Elliot Minor]] and [[The Script]]. They also played a set on the O2 Wireless Main Stage in London's [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]] on 4 July 2008, supporting acts such as [[The Wombats]], [[Dirty Pretty Things (band)|Dirty Pretty Things]], [[Beck]] and [[Morrissey]].\n\nThey performed the Uncut Arena at the 2008 [[Latitude Festival]] on Saturday 19 July; in addition to this, they also played a live set to a screening of [[David Lynch]]'s film ''[[Eraserhead]]'' at the Music & Film Arena on the preceding Friday. The band performed as the first warm-up act, followed by [[Editors (band)|Editors]], for [[R.E.M.]] on 27 August 2008 at the [[Southampton]] [[Rose Bowl, Hampshire|Rose Bowl]].\n\nIn June 2008, Guillemots had their Kentish Town Forum gig filmed and later broadcast on [[Channel Bee|Channelbee]].\n\nIn July 2008 they played an improvised set to a screening of [[David Lynch]]'s ''[[Eraserhead]]'' on the [[Latitude Festival]].\n\nIn September 2008, they played at the 2008 Orange RockCorps Gig in the [[Royal Albert Hall]], some of which was broadcast on [[T4 (Channel 4)|T4]].\n\nOn 5 September 2008 they played a gig supporting Travis at The Quarry in Shrewsbury, Shropshire.

It functions under the authority of the [[Ministry of Home Affairs (India)|Ministry of Home Affairs]] (MHA) of the [[Government of India]]. The CRPF's primary role lies in assisting the State/Union Territories in police operations to maintain law and order and counter [[insurgency]]. It came into existence as the Crown Representative's Police on 27 July 1939. After [[Independence Day (India)|Indian Independence]], it became the Central Reserve Police Force on enactment of the CRPF Act on 28 December 1949.\n\nBesides law and order and counter-insurgency duties, the CRPF has played an increasingly large role in India's general elections. This is especially true for the Union Territory of [[Jammu and Kashmir]](erstwhile State), Bihar and in the [[North East India|North East]], with the presence of unrest and often violent conflict. During the Parliamentary elections of September 1999, the CRPF played a major role in the security arrangements. Of late, CRPF contingents are also being deployed in UN missions.\n\nWith 246 battalions and various other establishments, the CRPF is considered India's largest paramilitary force and has a sanctioned strength of more than 300,000 personnel as of 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://mha.nic.in/sites/upload_files/mha/files/EnglAnnualReport2016-17_17042017.pdf|title=MHA Annual Report 2016-2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170808200948/http://mha.nic.in/sites/upload_files/mha/files/EnglAnnualReport2016-17_17042017.pdf#|archive-date=8 August 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n== Mission ==\nThe mission of the Central Reserve Police Force shall be to enable the government to maintain Rule of Law, Public Order and Internal Security effectively and efficiently to preserve National Integrity & Promote Social Harmony and Development by upholding supremacy of the Constitution.\n\nIn performing these tasks with utmost regard for human dignity and freedom of the citizens of India, the force shall endeavor to achieve excellence in management of internal security and national calamities by placing Service and Loyalty above self.\n\n==History==\n\n* The CRPF was derived from the CRP (Crown Representative's Police) on 27 July 1939 with 2 battalions in [[Nimach]] [Means North Indian Mounted Artillery and Cavalry Headquarter], [[Madhya Pradesh]]. Its primary duty at the time was to protect the [[British resident]]s in sensitive states of India.<ref name=\"Milestones of Bravery\">{{Cite web|url=http://crpf.nic.in/milestones-of-bravery.htm|title=Milestones of Bravery|website=crpf.nic.in|access-date=12 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220142551/http://www.crpf.nic.in/milestones-of-bravery.htm|archive-date=20 December 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n* In 1949, the CRP was renamed under the CRPF Act. During the 1960s, many [[State Armed Police Forces|state reserve police]] battalions were merged with the CRPF. The CRPF has been active against foreign invasion and domestic insurgency.\n* On 21 October 1959, SI Karam Singh and 20 soldiers were attacked by the [[People's Liberation Army|Chinese Army]] at [[Hot Springs, Chang Chenmo Valley|Hot Springs]] in [[Ladakh]] resulting in 10 casualties. The survivors were imprisoned. Since then, 21 October is observed as [[Martyrs' Day (India)#21 October|Police Commemoration]] day nationwide, across all states in India.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=http://crpf.nic.in/milestones-of-bravery.htm|title=Milestones of Bravery|website=crpf.nic.in|access-date=5 July 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170705121356/http://crpf.nic.in/milestones-of-bravery.htm|archive-date=5 July 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n* On intervening night of 8 and 9 April 1965, 3500 men of 51st Infantry Brigade of [[Pakistan]], comprising 18 Punjab Bn, 8 Frontier Rifles and 6 Baluch Bn, stealthily launched operation \"Desert Hawk\" against border posts in [[Rann of Kutch]]. It was to the valour of Head Constable Bhawana Ram deployed on the eastern parameter of Sardar Post whose gallant act was to a great extent instrumental in demoralising the intruders and forcing them to retreat from the post.\nThere are few parallels of such a battle and the then Union Home Minister very appropriately graded it as a          \"Military Battle\" not a Police battle. The service and their sacrifice will now not need turning back to old records for appreciation with that historic moment being picked up for celebration as \"Valour Day\" of the Force after Year.\n{{check quotation}}\n* The CRPF guarded the [[India-Pakistan Border]] until 1965, at which point the [[Border Security Force]] was created for that purpose.\n* On [[2001 Indian Parliament attack]] the CRPF troopers killed all five terrorists who had entered the premises of the [[Indian Parliament]] in New Delhi.\n* When 5 armed terrorists tried to storm the [[Ram Janmabhoomi|Ram Janambhoomi]] / [[Babri Masjid]] Complex in [[Ayodhya]] on 5 July 2005 and had penetrated the outer security rings, they were challenged by CRPF which formed the inner security ring. Shri Vijeto Tinyi, AC and Shri Dharambir Singh, Head Constable, who exhibited exemplary gallant were awarded with \u2018Shaurya Chakra\u2019.<ref name=\"Milestones of Bravery\"/>\n* In recent years, the [[Government of India]] has decided to follow up on recommendations of the Indian cabinet to use each security agency for its mandated purpose. As a result, the [[counter-insurgency]] operations in India have been entrusted to the CRPF.\n* In 2008 a wing called [[Commando Battalion for Resolute Action]] (CoBRA) was added to the CRPF to counter the [[Naxalite]] movement.\n* On 2 September 2009, 5000 CRPF soldiers were deployed for a search and rescue mission to find the then Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister [[Y. S. Rajasekhara Reddy]] whose helicopter went missing over the Nallamalla Forest Range in Andhra Pradesh.  This was the largest search operation ever mounted in India.\n\nThe Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) is the premier central police force of the Union of India for internal security. Originally constituted as the Crown Representative Police in 1939, it is one of the oldest Central para military forces (now termed as Central Armed Police Force). CRPF was raised as a sequel to the political unrest and the agitations in the then princely States of India following the Madras Resolution of the All-India Congress Committee in 1936 and the ever-growing desire of the Crown Representative to help the vast majority of the native States to preserve law and order as a part of the imperial policy.\n\nAfter Independence, the force was renamed as Central Reserve Police Force by an Act of Parliament on 28 December 1949. This Act constituted CRPF as an armed force of the Union. Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, the then Home Minister, visualised a multi-dimensional role for it in tune with the changing needs of a newly independent nation.\n\nDuring the early 1950s, the performance of the CRPF detachments in Bhuj, the then Patiala and East Punjab state Union (PEPSU) and Chambal ravines was appreciated by all quarters. The force played a significant role during the amalgamation of the princely States into the Indian Union. It helped the Union Government in disciplining the rebellious princely States of Junagarh and the small principality of Kathiawar in Gujarat which had declined to join the Indian Union.\n\nSoon after Independence, contingents of the CRPF were sent on Kutch, Rajasthan and Sindh borders to check infiltration and trans-border crimes. They were, subsequently, deployed on the Pakistan border in Jammu and Kashmir following attacks launched by the Pakistani infiltrators. The CRPF bore the brunt of the first Chinese attack on India at Hot Springs (Ladakh) on 21 October 1959. A small CRPF patrol was ambushed by the Chinese in which ten of its men made their supreme sacrifice for the country. Their martyrdom on 21 October is remembered throughout the country as the Police Commemoration Day every year.\n\nDuring the Chinese aggression of 1962, the Force once again assisted the Indian Army in Arunachal Pradesh. Eight CRPF personnel were killed in action. In 1965 and 1971 Indo-Pak wars also the Force fought shoulder-to-shoulder with the Indian Army, both on the Western and Eastern borders.\n\nFor the first time in the history of para-military Forces in India, thirteen companies of CRPF including a detachment of women were airlifted to join the Indian Peace Keeping Force in Sri Lanka to fight the militant caders. Besides, CRPF personnel were also sent to Haiti, Namibia, Somalia and Maldives to deal with law and order situation there, as a part of the UN Peace Keeping Force.\n\nIn the late seventies, when the extremist elements disturbed peace in Tripura and Manipur, CRPF battalions were deployed in strength. Simultaneously, there was a turmoil in the Brahmaputra Valley. The CRPF had to be inducted in strength not only to maintain law and order but also to keep lines of communication free from disruption.

The services rendered by the CRPF in Sri Lanka as part of IPKF, as part of the UN Peace Keeping Force in Namibia, Somalia, Haiti, Maldives and also in Bosnia speaks volumes about the ability, agility, versatility and dependability of the Force to adapt to any conflict-situation round the globe. Presently a contingent of 240 personnel of RAF are deployed in KOSOVO as UN Mission in Kosovo is to provide protection and security to the UN officials/UN civil police/ Crowd control etc. RAF coys will also assist local Police to control /mob during violent demonstration, humanitarian and to assist the activities of the ICTY.\n\n=== Haiti Mission ===\n\n==== Background ====\nHaiti was under the commandment of National Council of Government in 1986 under Jean Claude Duvalier. The country went through a series of political instability moving from one military Government to other from 1986 to 1991. The country experienced 4 military coup. In 1991 military government was replaced by a young priest Jean Bertrand Aristide who took over as President after election in November 1990, he was overthrown after 7 months in Sept 1991 by General Cadres. The Priest Jean Bertrand Aristide took asylum in USA with U.S troops who prepared to enter Haiti under orders from President Bill Clinton of USA. The Wind was favourable for the return of Aristide to power by holding elections in Haiti in Oct 1994.\n\nA contingent of 120 male personnel selected from CRPF and RAF Units was formed up, trained and equipped for duties at 103 RAF in Delhi and they were sent to Haiti on 31 March\u201994. This contingent, then called as Company, worked in Haiti for various duties during elections as a part of US Army contingent forming 504 Military Police Battalion (Dragon Fighters) under UN Mission in HAITI (UNMIH).\n\n====Duties performed====\nThe duties performed by the contingent included mobile patrolling, saturation patrolling, manning and guarding of Police Stations and the National Prison, combined mounted/dismounted patrols, Prison monitor teams and security escorts. They also trained the prisoners. All such duties were conducted as a special arrangement for peaceful conduct of Presidential elections in Haiti.\n\nShri R.S.H.S Sahota then Commandant, was the Contingent Commander. In recognition of the continent's excellent performance in Haiti, the contingent was awarded on U.S. Army Commendation Medal, 5 US Army Achievement Medals, 80 appreciation coins and UN Medal to all 120 personnel. After successful completion of the assigned task, this contingent was de-inducted from Haiti during November 1995.\n\n=== Liberia Mission ===\nOn a special request from United Nations and direction of Govt. of India/Ministry of Home Affairs, a fully formed Female Police Unit (FFPU) was formed up with Mahila CRPF personnel which was further deployed in Liberia during Feb 2007, as part of an UN peacekeeping force in the strife-torn African nation.\n\nOut of the 23 nations deployed there, only India has the privilege of having an exclusive women's team there, and it was the first exclusive female team of police which was pressed into action in any UN peacekeeping force.\n\nThis deployment is still on as part of the UN mission however is now supplemented by a male Contingent also. Tenure of each contingent is for one year. At present, 8th Batch of Female contingents and 5th Batch of Male contingents have been deployed in Liberia.\n\n===Current role and strength===\nAs of 2010, the CRPF is the largest paramilitary organisation of the country and is actively looking after the internal security of every part of India and were operating abroad as part of [[Indian Peace Keeping Force|IPKF]] and the [[United Nations peacekeeping]] missions.

(LWE Region)}}\n{{Politics of India}}\nThe '''Central Reserve Police Force''' ('''CRPF''') is India's largest [[Central Armed Police Forces|Central Armed Police Force]]. It functions under the authority of the [[Ministry of Home Affairs (India)|Ministry of Home Affairs]] (MHA) of the [[Government of India]]. The CRPF's primary role lies in assisting the State/Union Territories in police operations to maintain law and order and counter [[insurgency]]. It came into existence as the Crown Representative's Police on 27 July 1939. After [[Independence Day (India)|Indian Independence]], it became the Central Reserve Police Force on enactment of the CRPF Act on 28 December 1949.\n\nBesides law and order and counter-insurgency duties, the CRPF has played an increasingly large role in India's general elections. This is especially true for the Union Territory of [[Jammu and Kashmir]](erstwhile State), Bihar and in the [[North East India|North East]], with the presence of unrest and often violent conflict. During the Parliamentary elections of September 1999, the CRPF played a major role in the security arrangements. Of late, CRPF contingents are also being deployed in UN missions.\n\nWith 246 battalions and various other establishments, the CRPF is considered India's largest paramilitary force and has a sanctioned strength of more than 300,000 personnel as of 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://mha.nic.in/sites/upload_files/mha/files/EnglAnnualReport2016-17_17042017.pdf|title=MHA Annual Report 2016-2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170808200948/http://mha.nic.in/sites/upload_files/mha/files/EnglAnnualReport2016-17_17042017.pdf#|archive-date=8 August 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n== Mission ==\nThe mission of the Central Reserve Police Force shall be to enable the government to maintain Rule of Law, Public Order and Internal Security effectively and efficiently to preserve National Integrity & Promote Social Harmony and Development by upholding supremacy of the Constitution.\n\nIn performing these tasks with utmost regard for human dignity and freedom of the citizens of India, the force shall endeavor to achieve excellence in management of internal security and national calamities by placing Service and Loyalty above self.\n\n==History==\n\n* The CRPF was derived from the CRP (Crown Representative's Police) on 27 July 1939 with 2 battalions in [[Nimach]] [Means North Indian Mounted Artillery and Cavalry Headquarter], [[Madhya Pradesh]]. Its primary duty at the time was to protect the [[British resident]]s in sensitive states of India.<ref name=\"Milestones of Bravery\">{{Cite web|url=http://crpf.nic.in/milestones-of-bravery.htm|title=Milestones of Bravery|website=crpf.nic.in|access-date=12 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220142551/http://www.crpf.nic.in/milestones-of-bravery.htm|archive-date=20 December 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n* In 1949, the CRP was renamed under the CRPF Act. During the 1960s, many [[State Armed Police Forces|state reserve police]] battalions were merged with the CRPF. The CRPF has been active against foreign invasion and domestic insurgency.\n* On 21 October 1959, SI Karam Singh and 20 soldiers were attacked by the [[People's Liberation Army|Chinese Army]] at [[Hot Springs, Chang Chenmo Valley|Hot Springs]] in [[Ladakh]] resulting in 10 casualties. The survivors were imprisoned. Since then, 21 October is observed as [[Martyrs' Day (India)#21 October|Police Commemoration]] day nationwide, across all states in India.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=http://crpf.nic.in/milestones-of-bravery.htm|title=Milestones of Bravery|website=crpf.nic.in|access-date=5 July 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170705121356/http://crpf.nic.in/milestones-of-bravery.htm|archive-date=5 July 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n* On intervening night of 8 and 9 April 1965, 3500 men of 51st Infantry Brigade of [[Pakistan]], comprising 18 Punjab Bn, 8 Frontier Rifles and 6 Baluch Bn, stealthily launched operation \"Desert Hawk\" against border posts in [[Rann of Kutch]]. It was to the valour of Head Constable Bhawana Ram deployed on the eastern parameter of Sardar Post whose gallant act was to a great extent instrumental in demoralising the intruders and forcing them to retreat from the post.\nThere are few parallels of such a battle and the then Union Home Minister very appropriately graded it as a          \"Military Battle\" not a Police battle. The service and their sacrifice will now not need turning back to old records for appreciation with that historic moment being picked up for celebration as \"Valour Day\" of the Force after Year.\n{{check quotation}}\n* The CRPF guarded the [[India-Pakistan Border]] until 1965, at which point the [[Border Security Force]] was created for that purpose.\n* On [[2001 Indian Parliament attack]] the CRPF troopers killed all five terrorists who had entered the premises of the [[Indian Parliament]] in New Delhi.\n* When 5 armed terrorists tried to storm the [[Ram Janmabhoomi|Ram Janambhoomi]] / [[Babri Masjid]] Complex in [[Ayodhya]] on 5 July 2005 and had penetrated the outer security rings, they were challenged by CRPF which formed the inner security ring. Shri Vijeto Tinyi, AC and Shri Dharambir Singh, Head Constable, who exhibited exemplary gallant were awarded with \u2018Shaurya Chakra\u2019.<ref name=\"Milestones of Bravery\"/>\n* In recent years, the [[Government of India]] has decided to follow up on recommendations of the Indian cabinet to use each security agency for its mandated purpose. As a result, the [[counter-insurgency]] operations in India have been entrusted to the CRPF.\n* In 2008 a wing called [[Commando Battalion for Resolute Action]] (CoBRA) was added to the CRPF to counter the [[Naxalite]] movement.\n* On 2 September 2009, 5000 CRPF soldiers were deployed for a search and rescue mission to find the then Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister [[Y. S. Rajasekhara Reddy]] whose helicopter went missing over the Nallamalla Forest Range in Andhra Pradesh.  This was the largest search operation ever mounted in India.\n\nThe Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) is the premier central police force of the Union of India for internal security. Originally constituted as the Crown Representative Police in 1939, it is one of the oldest Central para military forces (now termed as Central Armed Police Force). CRPF was raised as a sequel to the political unrest and the agitations in the then princely States of India following the Madras Resolution of the All-India Congress Committee in 1936 and the ever-growing desire of the Crown Representative to help the vast majority of the native States to preserve law and order as a part of the imperial policy.\n\nAfter Independence, the force was renamed as Central Reserve Police Force by an Act of Parliament on 28 December 1949. This Act constituted CRPF as an armed force of the Union. Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, the then Home Minister, visualised a multi-dimensional role for it in tune with the changing needs of a newly independent nation.\n\nDuring the early 1950s, the performance of the CRPF detachments in Bhuj, the then Patiala and East Punjab state Union (PEPSU) and Chambal ravines was appreciated by all quarters. The force played a significant role during the amalgamation of the princely States into the Indian Union. It helped the Union Government in disciplining the rebellious princely States of Junagarh and the small principality of Kathiawar in Gujarat which had declined to join the Indian Union.\n\nSoon after Independence, contingents of the CRPF were sent on Kutch, Rajasthan and Sindh borders to check infiltration and trans-border crimes. They were, subsequently, deployed on the Pakistan border in Jammu and Kashmir following attacks launched by the Pakistani infiltrators. The CRPF bore the brunt of the first Chinese attack on India at Hot Springs (Ladakh) on 21 October 1959. A small CRPF patrol was ambushed by the Chinese in which ten of its men made their supreme sacrifice for the country. Their martyrdom on 21 October is remembered throughout the country as the Police Commemoration Day every year.\n\nDuring the Chinese aggression of 1962, the Force once again assisted the Indian Army in Arunachal Pradesh. Eight CRPF personnel were killed in action. In 1965 and 1971 Indo-Pak wars also the Force fought shoulder-to-shoulder with the Indian Army, both on the Western and Eastern borders.\n\nFor the first time in the history of para-military Forces in India, thirteen companies of CRPF including a detachment of women were airlifted to join the Indian Peace Keeping Force in Sri Lanka to fight the militant caders. Besides, CRPF personnel were also sent to Haiti, Namibia, Somalia and Maldives to deal with law and order situation there, as a part of the UN Peace Keeping Force.\n\nIn the late seventies, when the extremist elements disturbed peace in Tripura and Manipur, CRPF battalions were deployed in strength. Simultaneously, there was a turmoil in the Brahmaputra Valley. The CRPF had to be inducted in strength not only to maintain law and order but also to keep lines of communication free from disruption. The commitments of the Force continue to be very high in the North-East in dealing with the insurgency.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://crpf.gov.in/rec/history-crpf.htm|title=History of CRPF {{!}} About Us {{!}} Central Reserve Police Force, Government of India.|website=crpf.gov.in|access-date=7 June 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Conflicts and operations ==\n\n=== Sri Lanka Mission ===\nThe role of the CRPF and its services rendered have extended beyond the nation's borders as well. The services rendered by the CRPF in Sri Lanka as part of IPKF, as part of the UN Peace Keeping Force in Namibia, Somalia, Haiti, Maldives and also in Bosnia speaks volumes about the ability, agility, versatility and dependability of the Force to adapt to any conflict-situation round the globe. Presently a contingent of 240 personnel of RAF are deployed in KOSOVO as UN Mission in Kosovo is to provide protection and security to the UN officials/UN civil police/ Crowd control etc. RAF coys will also assist local Police to control /mob during violent demonstration, humanitarian and to assist the activities of the ICTY.\n\n=== Haiti Mission ===\n\n==== Background ====\nHaiti was under the commandment of National Council of Government in 1986 under Jean Claude Duvalier. The country went through a series of political instability moving from one military Government to other from 1986 to 1991. The country experienced 4 military coup. In 1991 military government was replaced by a young priest Jean Bertrand Aristide who took over as President after election in November 1990, he was overthrown after 7 months in Sept 1991 by General Cadres. The Priest Jean Bertrand Aristide took asylum in USA with U.S troops who prepared to enter Haiti under orders from President Bill Clinton of USA. The Wind was favourable for the return of Aristide to power by holding elections in Haiti in Oct 1994.\n\nA contingent of 120 male personnel selected from CRPF and RAF Units was formed up, trained and equipped for duties at 103 RAF in Delhi and they were sent to Haiti on 31 March\u201994. This contingent, then called as Company, worked in Haiti for various duties during elections as a part of US Army contingent forming 504 Military Police Battalion (Dragon Fighters) under UN Mission in HAITI (UNMIH).\n\n====Duties performed====\nThe duties performed by the contingent included mobile patrolling, saturation patrolling, manning and guarding of Police Stations and the National Prison, combined mounted/dismounted patrols, Prison monitor teams and security escorts. They also trained the prisoners. All such duties were conducted as a special arrangement for peaceful conduct of Presidential elections in Haiti.\n\nShri R.S.H.S Sahota then Commandant, was the Contingent Commander. In recognition of the continent's excellent performance in Haiti, the contingent was awarded on U.S. Army Commendation Medal, 5 US Army Achievement Medals, 80 appreciation coins and UN Medal to all 120 personnel. After successful completion of the assigned task, this contingent was de-inducted from Haiti during November 1995.\n\n=== Liberia Mission ===\nOn a special request from United Nations and direction of Govt. of India/Ministry of Home Affairs, a fully formed Female Police Unit (FFPU) was formed up with Mahila CRPF personnel which was further deployed in Liberia during Feb 2007, as part of an UN peacekeeping force in the strife-torn African nation.\n\nOut of the 23 nations deployed there, only India has the privilege of having an exclusive women's team there, and it was the first exclusive female team of police which was pressed into action in any UN peacekeeping force.\n\nThis deployment is still on as part of the UN mission however is now supplemented by a male Contingent also. Tenure of each contingent is for one year. At present, 8th Batch of Female contingents and 5th Batch of Male contingents have been deployed in Liberia.\n\n===Current role and strength===\nAs of 2010, the CRPF is the largest paramilitary organisation of the country and is actively looking after the internal security of every part of India and were operating abroad as part of [[Indian Peace Keeping Force|IPKF]] and the [[United Nations peacekeeping]] missions. It is performing a variety of duties ranging from VIP security to election duties, from guarding of vital installations to the counter-naxal operations.\n\n== List of Chiefs of CRPF ==\nV. G.

The word \"permutation\" also refers to the act or process of changing the linear order of an ordered set.<ref>{{harvtxt|Webster|1969}}</ref>\n\nPermutations differ from [[combination]]s, which are selections of some members of a set regardless of order. For example, written as [[tuple]]s, there are six permutations of the set {1,2,3}, namely: (1,2,3), (1,3,2), (2,1,3), (2,3,1), (3,1,2), and (3,2,1). These are all the possible orderings of this three-element set. [[Anagram]]s of words whose letters are different are also permutations: the letters are already ordered in the original word, and the anagram is a reordering of the letters. The study of permutations of [[finite set]]s is an important topic in the fields of [[combinatorics]] and [[group theory]].\n\nPermutations are used in almost every branch of mathematics, and in many other fields of science. In [[computer science]], they are used for analyzing [[sorting algorithm]]s; in [[quantum physics]], for describing states of particles; and in [[biology]], for describing [[RNA]] sequences. \n\n{{anchor|n-factorial}}The number of permutations of {{math|''n''}} distinct objects is {{math|''n''}}&nbsp;[[factorial]], usually written as {{math|''n''!}}, which means the product of all positive integers less than or equal to {{math|''n''}}.\n\nTechnically, a permutation of a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] {{math|''S''}} is defined as a [[bijection]] from {{math|''S''}} to itself.<ref>{{harvtxt|McCoy|1968|p=152}}</ref><ref>{{harvtxt|Nering|1970|p=86}}</ref>  That is, it is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] from {{math|''S''}} to {{math|''S''}} for which every element occurs exactly once as an [[image (mathematics)|image]] value. This is related to the rearrangement of the elements of {{math|''S''}} in which each element {{math|''s''}} is replaced by the corresponding {{math|''f''(''s'')}}. For example, the permutation (3,1,2) mentioned above is described by the function <math>\\alpha</math> defined as:\n\n: <math>\\alpha(1) = 3, \\quad \\alpha(2) = 1, \\quad \\alpha(3) = 2</math>.\n\nThe collection of all permutations of a set form a [[group (mathematics)|group]] called the [[symmetric group]] of the set. The group operation is the [[function composition|composition]] (performing two given rearrangements in succession), which results in another rearrangement. As properties of permutations do not depend on the nature of the set elements, it is often the permutations of the set <math>\\{1, 2, \\ldots, n\\}</math> that are considered for studying permutations. \n\nIn elementary combinatorics, the {{math|''k''}}-permutations, or [[partial permutation]]s, are the ordered arrangements of {{math|''k''}} distinct elements selected from a set. When {{math|''k''}} is equal to the size of the set, these are the permutations of the set.\n\n[[Image:Rubik's cube.svg|thumb|In the popular puzzle [[Rubik's cube]] invented in 1974 by [[Ern\u0151 Rubik]], each turn of the puzzle faces creates a permutation of the surface colors.]]\n\n==History==\n[[Al-Khalil ibn Ahmad al-Farahidi|Al-Khalil]] (717\u2013786), an [[Mathematics in medieval Islam|Arab mathematician]] and [[cryptographer]], wrote the ''Book of Cryptographic Messages''.

The ''[[Lilavati]]'' by the Indian mathematician [[Bh\u0101skara II|Bhaskara II]] contains a passage that translates to:\n<blockquote>\nThe product of multiplication of the arithmetical series beginning and increasing by unity and continued to the number of places, will be the variations of number with specific figures.<ref>{{cite journal |first=N.

Starting from two bells: \"first, ''two'' must be admitted to be varied in two ways\" which he illustrates by showing 1 2 and 2 1.{{sfn|Stedman|1677|p=4}}  He then explains that with three bells there are \"three times two figures to be produced out of three\" which again is illustrated.  His explanation involves \"cast away 3, and 1.2 will remain; cast away 2, and 1.3 will remain; cast away 1, and 2.3 will remain\".{{sfn|Stedman|1677|p=5}}  He then moves on to four bells and repeats the casting away argument showing that there will be four different sets of three.  Effectively this is a recursive process.  He continues with five bells using the \"casting away\" method and tabulates the resulting 120 combinations.{{sfn|Stedman|1677|pp=6\u20147}}  At this point he gives up and remarks:\n<blockquote>\nNow the nature of these methods is such, that the changes on one number comprehends the changes on all lesser numbers, ... insomuch that a compleat Peal of changes on one number seemeth to be formed by uniting of the compleat Peals on all lesser numbers into one entire body;{{sfn|Stedman|1677|p=8}}\n</blockquote>\nStedman widens the consideration of permutations; he goes on to consider the number of permutations of the letters of the alphabet and of horses from a stable of 20.{{sfn|Stedman|1677|pp=13\u201418}}\n\nA first case in which seemingly unrelated mathematical questions were studied with the help of permutations occurred around 1770, when [[Joseph Louis Lagrange]], in the study of polynomial equations, observed that properties of the permutations of the [[Polynomial#Solving polynomial equations|roots]] of an equation are related to the possibilities to solve it. This line of work ultimately resulted, through the work of [[\u00c9variste Galois]], in [[Galois theory]], which gives a complete description of what is possible and impossible with respect to solving polynomial equations (in one unknown) by radicals. In modern mathematics there are many similar situations in which understanding a problem requires studying certain permutations related to it.\n\n==Definition==\n\nIn mathematics texts it is customary to denote permutations using lowercase Greek letters. Commonly, either <math>\\alpha</math> and <math>\\beta</math>, or <math>\\sigma, \\tau</math> and <math>\\pi</math> are used.<ref name=\"Scheinerman\">{{cite book |last1=Scheinerman |first1=Edward A. |date=March 5, 2012 |chapter=Chapter 5: Functions |title=Mathematics: A Discrete Introduction |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DZBHGD2sEYwC&pg=PA188 |url-status=live |edition=3rd |publisher=Cengage Learning |page=188 |isbn=0840049420 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200205212843/https://books.google.com/books?id=DZBHGD2sEYwC&pg=PA188 |archive-date=February 5, 2020 |access-date=February 5, 2020 |quote=It is customary to use lowercase Greek letters (especially \u03c0, \u03c3, and \u03c4) to stand for permutations.}}</ref>\n\nPermutations can be defined as bijections from a set {{math|''S''}} onto itself. All permutations of a set with ''n'' elements form a [[symmetric group]], denoted <math>S_n</math>, where the [[group operation]] is [[Composition of functions|function composition]]. Thus for two permutations, <math>\\pi</math> and <math>\\sigma</math> in the group <math>S_n</math>, the four group axioms hold: \n\n# [[Closure (mathematics)|Closure]]: If <math>\\pi</math> and <math>\\sigma</math> are in <math>S_n</math> then so is <math>\\pi\\sigma.</math> \n# [[Associativity]]: For any three permutations <math>\\pi, \\sigma, \\tau \\in S_n</math>, <math>(\\pi\\sigma)\\tau = \\pi(\\sigma\\tau).</math>\n# [[Identity element|Identity]]: There is an identity permutation, denoted <math>\\operatorname{id}</math> and defined by <math>\\operatorname{id}(x) = x</math> for all <math>x \\in S</math>.

Is it \"emphasized\" because it\u2019s important? or only for clarity?  -->\nit is emphasized that a permutation is a function that ''performs'' a rearrangement of a set and is not a rearrangement itself. The older and more elementary view holds that permutations are the rearrangements. Sometimes to distinguish these two views, the words ''active'' and ''passive'' forms, or in older terminology ''substitutions'' and ''permutations'' are used.{{sfn|Cameron|1994|loc=p. 29, footnote 3}}\n\nA permutation can be decomposed into one or more disjoint ''cycles'', that is, the [[Orbit (group theory)|orbits]], which are found by repeatedly tracing the application of the permutation on some elements. For example, the permutation <math>\\sigma</math> defined by <math>\\sigma(7) = 7</math> has a 1-cycle, <math>(\\,7\\,)</math> while the permutation <math>\\pi</math> defined by <math>\\pi(2) = 3</math> and <math>\\pi(3) = 2</math> has a 2-cycle <math>(\\,2\\,3\\,)</math> (for details on the syntax see the section [[#Cycle notation|Cycle notation]] below). In general, a cycle of length ''k'', that is, consisting of ''k'' elements, is called a ''k''-cycle.\n\nAn element in a 1-cycle <math>(\\,x\\,)</math> is called a [[Fixed point (mathematics)|fixed point]] of the permutation. A permutation with no fixed points is called a [[derangement]]. 2-cycles are called [[transposition (mathematics)|transpositions]]; such permutations merely exchange two elements, leaving the others fixed.\n\n==Notations==\n{{anchor|Two-line notation}} Since writing permutations elementwise, that is, as [[piecewise]] functions, is cumbersome, several notations have been invented to represent them more compactly. ''Cycle notation'' is a popular choice for many mathematicians due to its compactness and the fact that it makes a permutation's structure transparent. It is the notation used in this article unless otherwise specified, but other notations are still widely used, especially in application areas. \n\n===Two-line notation===\nIn [[Augustin-Louis Cauchy|Cauchy]]'s ''two-line notation'',<ref>{{citation|title=The Genesis of the Abstract Group Concept: A Contribution to the History of the Origin of Abstract Group Theory|first=Hans|last=Wussing|publisher=Courier Dover Publications|year=2007|isbn=9780486458687|page=94|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Xp3JymnfAq4C&pg=PA94|quote=Cauchy used his permutation notation\u2014in which the arrangements are written one below the other and both are enclosed in parentheses\u2014for the first time in 1815.}}</ref> one lists the elements of ''S'' in the first row, and for each one its image below it in the second row. For instance, a particular permutation of the set ''S'' = {1,2,3,4,5} can be written as:\n: <math>\\sigma = \\begin{pmatrix}\n  1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 \\\\\n  2 & 5 & 4 & 3 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix};</math>\nthis means that ''\u03c3'' satisfies {{nowrap|''\u03c3''(1) {{=}} 2}}, {{nowrap|''\u03c3''(2) {{=}} 5}}, {{nowrap|''\u03c3''(3) {{=}} 4}}, {{nowrap|''\u03c3''(4) {{=}} 3}}, and {{nowrap|''\u03c3''(5) {{=}} 1}}. The elements of ''S'' may appear in any order in the first row. This permutation could also be written as:\n: <math>\\sigma = \\begin{pmatrix}\n  3 & 2 & 5 & 1 & 4 \\\\\n  4 & 5 & 1 & 2 & 3\n\\end{pmatrix},</math>\nor\n: <math>\\sigma = \\begin{pmatrix}\n  5 & 1 & 4 & 3 & 2 \\\\\n  1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5\n\\end{pmatrix}.</math>\n\n===One-line notation===\nIf there is a \"natural\" order for the elements of ''S'',{{efn|The order is often implicitly understood. A set of integers is naturally written from smallest to largest; a set of letters is written in lexicographic order. For other sets, a natural order needs to be specified explicitly.}} say <math>x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n</math>, then one uses this for the first row of the two-line notation:\n: <math>\\sigma = \\begin{pmatrix}\n  x_1         & x_2         & x_3         & \\cdots & x_n \\\\\n  \\sigma(x_1) & \\sigma(x_2) & \\sigma(x_3) & \\cdots & \\sigma(x_n)\n\\end{pmatrix}.</math>\n\nUnder this assumption, one may omit the first row and write the permutation in ''one-line notation'' as\n: <math>(\\sigma(x_1) \\; \\sigma(x_2) \\; \\sigma(x_3) \\; \\cdots \\; \\sigma(x_n) )</math>,\nthat is, an ordered arrangement of S.<ref>{{harvnb|Bogart|1990|p=17}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Gerstein|1987|p=217}}</ref> Care must be taken to distinguish one-line notation from the [[#Cycle notation|cycle notation]] described below. In mathematics literature, a common usage is to omit parentheses for one-line notation, while using them for cycle notation. The one-line notation is also called the ''[[Word (mathematics)|word]] representation'' of a permutation.<ref name=\"Aigner2007\"/> The example above would then be 2 5 4 3 1 since the natural order 1 2 3 4 5 would be assumed for the first row. (It is typical to use commas to separate these entries only if some have two or more digits.) This form is more compact, and is common in elementary [[combinatorics]] and [[computer science]]. It is especially useful in applications where the elements of ''S'' or the permutations are to be compared as larger or smaller.\n\n===Cycle notation===\nCycle notation describes the effect of repeatedly applying the permutation on the elements of the set. It expresses the permutation as a product of [[cyclic permutation|cycles]]; since distinct cycles are [[disjoint sets|disjoint]], this is referred to as \"decomposition into disjoint cycles\".{{efn|Due to the likely possibility of confusion, cycle notation is not used in conjunction with one-line notation (sequences) for permutations.}}\n\nTo write down the permutation <math>\\sigma</math> in cycle notation, one proceeds as follows:\n\n# Write an opening bracket then select an arbitrary element ''x'' of <math>S</math> and write it down: <math>(\\,x</math>\n# Then trace the orbit of ''x''; that is, write down its values under successive applications of <math>\\sigma</math>: <math>(\\,x\\,\\sigma(x)\\,\\sigma(\\sigma(x))\\,\\ldots</math>\n# Repeat until the value returns to ''x'' and write down a closing parenthesis rather than ''x'': <math>(\\,x\\,\\sigma(x)\\,\\sigma(\\sigma(x))\\,\\ldots\\,)</math>\n# Now continue with an element ''y'' of ''S'', not yet written down, and proceed in the same way: <math>(\\,x\\,\\sigma(x)\\,\\sigma(\\sigma(x))\\,\\ldots\\,)(\\,y\\,\\ldots\\,)</math>\n# Repeat until all elements of ''S'' are written in cycles.\n\nSince for every new cycle the starting point can be chosen in different ways, there are in general many different cycle notations for the same permutation; for the example above one has:\n\n:<math>\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 \\\\\n2 & 5 & 4 & 3 & 1\\end{pmatrix}=\\begin{pmatrix}1 & 2 & 5 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix}3 & 4 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix}3 & 4 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix}1 & 2 & 5 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix}3 & 4 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix}5 & 1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}.</math>\n\n1-cycles are often omitted from the cycle notation, provided that the context is clear; for any element ''x'' in ''S'' not appearing in any cycle, one implicitly assumes <math>\\sigma(x) = x</math>.<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|1959|p=54}}</ref> The [[identity permutation]], which consists only of 1-cycles, can be denoted by a single 1-cycle (x), by the number 1,{{efn|1 is frequently used to represent the [[identity element]] in a non-commutative group}} or by ''id''.<ref>{{harvnb|Rotman|2002|p=41}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Bogart|1990|p=487}}</ref>\n\nA convenient feature of cycle notation is that one can find a permutation's inverse simply by reversing the order of the elements in the permutation's cycles.

However this gives a ''different'' rule for multiplying permutations; this article uses the definition where the rightmost permutation is applied first.\n\n==Other uses of the term ''permutation''==\nThe concept of a permutation as an ordered arrangement admits several generalizations that are not permutations but have been called permutations in the literature.\n\n===''k''-permutations of ''n''===\nA weaker meaning of the term ''permutation'', sometimes used in elementary combinatorics texts, designates those ordered arrangements in which no element occurs more than once, but without the requirement of using all the elements from a given set. These are not permutations except in special cases, but are natural generalizations of the ordered arrangement concept. Indeed, this use often involves considering arrangements of a fixed length&nbsp;''k'' of elements taken from a given set of size ''n'', in other words, these '''''k''-permutations of ''n''''' are the different ordered arrangements of a ''k''-element subset of an ''n''-set (sometimes called '''variations'''  or ''''arrangements'''' in the older literature.{{efn|More precisely, ''variations without repetition''. The term is still common in other languages and appears in modern English most often in translation.}}) These objects are also known as '''[[Partial permutation#Restricted partial permutations|partial permutations]]''' or as '''sequences without repetition''', terms that avoid confusion with the other, more common, meaning of \"permutation\". The number of such <math>k</math>-permutations of <math>n</math> is denoted variously by such symbols as <math>P^n_k</math>,  <math>_nP_k</math>, <math>^nP_k</math>, <math>P_{n,k}</math>, or <math>P(n,k)</math>, and its value is given by the product<ref>{{cite book|author=Charalambides, Ch A.|title=Enumerative Combinatorics|publisher=CRC Press|year=2002|isbn=978-1-58488-290-9|page=42|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PDMGA-v5G54C&pg=PA42}}</ref>\n\n: <math>P(n,k) = \\underbrace{n\\cdot(n-1)\\cdot(n-2)\\cdots(n-k+1)}_{k\\ \\mathrm{factors}}</math>,\nwhich is 0 when {{nowrap|''k'' &gt; ''n''}}, and otherwise is equal to\n: <math>\\frac{n!}{(n-k)!}.</math>\n\nThe product is well defined without the assumption that <math>n</math> is a non-negative integer and is of importance outside combinatorics as well; it is known as the [[Pochhammer symbol]] <math>(n)_k</math> or as the <math>k</math>-th falling factorial power <math>n^{\\underline k}</math> of <math>n</math>.\n\nThis usage of the term ''permutation'' is closely related to the term ''[[combination]]''. A ''k''-element combination of an ''n''-set ''S'' is a ''k'' element subset of ''S'', the elements of which are not ordered. By taking all the ''k'' element subsets of ''S'' and ordering each of them in all possible ways we obtain all the ''k''-permutations of ''S''. The number of ''k''-combinations of an ''n''-set, ''C''(''n'',''k''), is therefore related to the number of ''k''-permutations of ''n'' by:\n: <math>C(n,k) = \\frac{P(n,k)}{P(k,k)} = \\frac{\\tfrac{n!}{(n-k)!}}{\\tfrac{k!}{0!}} = \\frac{n!}{(n-k)!\\,k!}.</math>\n\nThese numbers are also known as [[binomial coefficient]]s and are denoted by <math>\\binom{n}{k}</math>.\n<!--\n\n--- Duplicate of above ... hold for possible inclusion\n\n===Counting sequences without repetition===\nIn this section, a ''k''-permutation of a set ''S'' is an ordered sequence of ''k'' distinct elements of ''S''. For example, given the set of letters {<tt>C</tt>, <tt>E</tt>, <tt>G</tt>, <tt>I</tt>, <tt>N</tt>, <tt>R</tt>}, the sequence <tt>ICE</tt> is a 3-permutation, <tt>RING</tt> and  <tt>RICE</tt> are 4-permutations, <tt>NICER</tt> and <tt>REIGN</tt> are 5-permutations, and <tt>CRINGE</tt> is a 6-permutation; since the latter uses all letters, it is a permutation of the given set in the ordinary combinatorial sense. <tt>ENGINE</tt> on the other hand is not a permutation, because of the repetitions: it uses the elements <tt>E</tt> and <tt>N</tt> twice.\n\nLet ''n'' be the size of ''S'', the number of elements available for selection. In constructing a ''k''-permutation, there are ''n''&nbsp; possible choices for the first element of the sequence, and this is then number of 1-permutations. Once it has been chosen, there are {{nowrap|''n'' \u2212 1}} elements of ''S'' left to choose from, so a second element can be chosen in {{nowrap|''n'' \u2212 1}} ways, giving a total ''n'' \u00d7 (''n'' \u2212 1) possible 2-permutations. For each successive element of the sequence, the number of possibilities decreases by 1&nbsp; which leads to the number of\n:''n'' \u00d7 (''n'' \u2212 1) \u00d7 (''n'' \u2212 2)  ... \u00d7 (''n'' \u2212 ''k'' + 1) possible ''k''-permutations.\nThis gives in particular the number of ''n''-permutations (which contain all elements of ''S'' once, and are therefore simply permutations of ''S''):\n:''n'' \u00d7 (''n'' \u2212 1) \u00d7 (''n'' \u2212 2) \u00d7 ... \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1,\na number that occurs so frequently in mathematics that it is given a compact notation \"''n''!\", and is called \"''n'' [[factorial]]\". These ''n''-permutations are the longest sequences without repetition of elements of ''S'', which is reflected by the fact that the above formula for the number of ''k''-permutations gives zero whenever ''k''&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;''n''.\n\nThe number of ''k''-permutations of a set of ''n'' elements is sometimes denoted by ''P''(''n'',''k'') or a similar notation (usually accompanied by a notation for the number of ''k''-[[combination]]s of a set of ''n'' elements in which the \"''P''\" is replaced by \"''C''\"). That notation is rarely used in other contexts than that of counting ''k''-permutations, but the expression for the number does arise in many other situations. Being a product of ''k'' factors starting at ''n'' and decreasing by unit steps, it is called the ''k''-th falling factorial power of ''n'':\n:<math>n^{\\underline k}=n\\times(n-1)\\times(n-2)\\times\\cdots\\times(n-k+1),</math>\nthough many other names and notations are in use, as detailed at [[Pochhammer symbol]]. When ''k''&nbsp;\u2264&nbsp;''n'' the factorial power can be completed by additional factors: ''n''<sup><u>''k''</u></sup>&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;(''n''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;''k'')!&nbsp;=&nbsp;''n''!, which allows writing\n:<math>n^{\\underline k}=\\frac{n!}{(n-k)!}.</math>\nThe right hand side is often given as expression for the number of ''k''-permutations, but its main merit is using the compact factorial notation. Expressing a product of ''k'' factors as a quotient of potentially much larger products, where all factors in the denominator are also explicitly present in the numerator, is not particularly efficient; as a method of computation there is the additional danger of overflow or rounding errors. It should also be noted that the expression is undefined when ''k''&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;''n'', whereas in those cases the number ''n''<sup><u>''k''</u></sup> of ''k''-permutations is just&nbsp;0.\n-->\n\n===Permutations with repetition===\nOrdered arrangements of the elements of a set ''S'' of length ''n'' where repetition is allowed are called [[Tuple|''n''-tuples]], but have sometimes been referred to as '''permutations with repetition''' although they are not permutations in general. They are also called [[word (mathematics)|words]] over the alphabet ''S'' in some contexts. If the set ''S'' has ''k'' elements, the number of ''n''-tuples over ''S'' is:\n:<math>k^n.</math>\nThere is no restriction on how often an element can appear in an ''n''-tuple, but if restrictions are placed on how often an element can appear, this formula is no longer valid.\n\n===Permutations of multisets===\n[[File:Permutations with repetition.svg|thumb|Permutations of multisets]]\n\nIf ''M'' is a finite [[multiset]], then a '''multiset permutation''' is an ordered arrangement of elements of ''M'' in which each element appears a number of times equal exactly to its multiplicity in ''M''. An [[anagram]] of a word having some repeated letters is an example of a multiset permutation.{{efn|The natural order in this example is the order of the letters in the original word.}} If the multiplicities of the elements of ''M'' (taken in some order) are <math>m_1</math>, <math>m_2</math>, ..., <math>m_l</math> and their sum (i.e., the size of ''M'') is ''n'', then the number of multiset permutations of ''M'' is given by the [[Multinomial coefficient#Multinomial coefficients|multinomial coefficient]],<ref>{{harvnb|Brualdi|2010|loc=p. 46, Theorem 2.4.2}}</ref>\n:<math>{n \\choose m_1, m_2, \\ldots, m_l} = \\frac{n!}{m_1!\\, m_2!\\, \\cdots\\, m_l!}= \\frac{(\\sum_{i=1}^l{m_i})!}\n{\\prod_{i=1}^l{m_i!} }.</math>\n\nFor example, the number of distinct anagrams of the word MISSISSIPPI is:<ref>{{harvnb|Brualdi|2010|p=47}}</ref>\n:<math>\\frac{11!}{1!\\, 4!\\, 4!\\, 2!} = 34650</math>.\n\nA '''k-permutation''' of a multiset ''M'' is a sequence of length ''k'' of elements of ''M'' in which each element appears ''at most'' its multiplicity in ''M'' times (an element's ''repetition number'').\n\n===Circular permutations===\nPermutations, when considered as arrangements, are sometimes referred to as ''linearly ordered'' arrangements. In these arrangements there is a first element, a second element, and so on. If, however, the objects are arranged in a circular manner this distinguished ordering no longer exists, that is, there is no \"first element\" in the arrangement, any element can be considered as the start of the arrangement. The arrangements of objects in a circular manner are called '''circular permutations'''.<ref>{{harvnb|Brualdi|2010|p=39}}</ref>{{efn|In older texts ''circular permutation'' was sometimes used as a synonym for [[cyclic permutation]], but this is no longer done. See {{harvtxt|Carmichael|1956|p=7}}}} These can be formally defined as [[equivalence classes]] of ordinary permutations of the objects, for the [[equivalence relation]] generated by moving the final element of the linear arrangement to its front.\n\nTwo circular permutations are equivalent if one can be rotated into the other (that is, cycled without changing the relative positions of the elements). The following two circular permutations on four letters are considered to be the same.\n\n<pre>\n     1           4\n   4   3       2   1\n     2           3</pre>\n\nThe circular arrangements are to be read counterclockwise, so the following two are not equivalent since no rotation can bring one to the other.\n<pre>\n     1          1\n   4   3      3   4\n     2          2</pre>\n\nThe number of circular permutations of a set ''S'' with ''n'' elements is (''n''&thinsp;\u2013&thinsp;1)!.\n\n==Properties==\nThe number of permutations of {{math|''n''}} distinct objects is {{math|''n''}}!.\n\nThe number of {{math|''n''}}-permutations with {{math|''k''}} disjoint cycles is the signless [[Stirling number of the first kind]], denoted by {{math|''c''(''n'', ''k'')}}.{{sfn|Bona|2012|pp=97\u2013103}}\n\n===Permutation type===\nThe cycles of a permutation partition the set <math>S_n</math> so the lengths of the cycles of a permutation <math>\\sigma</math> forms a [[partition (number theory)|partition]] of ''n'' called the [[cycle type]] of <math>\\sigma</math>. There is a \"1\" in the cycle type for every fixed point of \u03c3, a \"2\" for every transposition, and so on. The cycle type of <math>\\beta = (\\,1\\,2\\,5\\,)(\\,3\\,4\\,)(6\\,8\\,)(\\,7\\,)</math> is (3,2,2,1) which is sometimes written in a more compact form as [1<sup>1</sup>2<sup>2</sup>3<sup>1</sup>]. <!-- Biggs notation -->\n\nThe general form is <math>[1^{\\alpha_1}2^{\\alpha_2}\\dotsm n^{\\alpha_n}]</math>, where <math>\\alpha_1,\\ldots,\\alpha_n</math> are the number of cycles of respective length. The number of partitions of a certain type is then given by:\n: <math>\\frac{n!}{1^{\\alpha_1}2^{\\alpha_2}\\dotsm n^{\\alpha_n}\\alpha_1!\\alpha_2!\\dotsm \\alpha_n!}</math>.\n\n===Conjugating permutations===\nIn general, composing permutations written in cycle notation follows no easily described pattern \u2013 the cycles of the composition can be different from those being composed. However the cycle structure is preserved in the special case of [[conjugacy class|conjugating]] a permutation <math>\\sigma</math> by another permutation <math>\\pi</math>, which means forming the product <math>\\pi\\sigma\\pi^{-1}</math>. Here, <math>\\pi\\sigma\\pi^{-1}</math> is the ''conjugate'' of <math>\\sigma</math> and its cycle notation can be obtained by taking the cycle notation for ''\u03c3'' and applying ''\u03c0'' to all the entries in it.{{sfn|Humphreys|1996|p=84}} It follows that two permutations are conjugate exactly when they have the same type.\n\n===Permutation order===\nThe order of a permutation <math>\\sigma</math> is the smallest positive integer ''m'' so that <math>\\sigma^m = \\mathrm{id}</math>. It is the [[least common multiple]] of its cycles lengths. For example, the order of <math>(\\,1\\,3\\,2)(\\,4\\,5\\,)</math> is <math>2\\cdot3 = 6</math>.\n\n===Parity of a permutation===\nEvery permutation of a finite set can be expressed as the product of transpositions.<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|1959|p=60}}</ref>\nAlthough many such expressions for a given permutation may exist, either they all contain an even or an odd number of transpositions. Thus all permutations can be classified as [[Even and odd permutations|even or odd]] depending on this number.\n\nThis result can be extended so as to assign a ''sign'', written <math>\\operatorname{sgn}\\sigma</math>, to each permutation. <math>\\operatorname{sgn}\\sigma = +1</math> if <math>\\sigma</math> is even and <math>\\operatorname{sgn}\\sigma = -1</math> if <math>\\sigma</math> is odd. Then for two permutations <math>\\sigma</math> and <math>\\pi</math>\n\n: <math>\\operatorname{sgn}(\\sigma\\pi) = \\operatorname{sgn}\\sigma\\cdot\\operatorname{sgn}\\pi.</math>\n\nIt follows that <math>\\operatorname{sgn}(\\sigma\\sigma^{-1}) = +1.</math>\n\n===Matrix representation===\n[[File:Symmetric group 3; Cayley table; matrices.svg|thumb|Composition of permutations corresponds to multiplication of permutation matrices.]]\nOne can represent a permutation of {1, 2, ..., ''n''} as an ''n''\u00d7''n'' [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]]. There are two natural ways to do so, but only one for which multiplications of matrices corresponds to multiplication of permutations in the same order: this is the one that associates to ''\u03c3'' the matrix ''M'' whose entry ''M''<sub>''i'',''j''</sub> is 1 if ''i'' = ''\u03c3''(''j''), and 0 otherwise. The resulting matrix has exactly one entry 1 in each column and in each row, and is called a ''[[permutation matrix]]''. <br />\n[http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6d/Symmetric_group_4%3B_permutation_list_with_matrices.svg/1000px-Symmetric_group_4%3B_permutation_list_with_matrices.svg.png Here] <small>([[:File:Symmetric group 4; permutation list with matrices.svg|file]])</small> is a list of these matrices for permutations of 4 elements. The [[Cayley table]] on the right shows these matrices for permutations of 3 elements.\n\n=== Foata's transition lemma ===\nThere is a relationship between the one-line and the canonical cycle notation. Consider the permutation <math>(\\,2\\,)(\\,3\\,1\\,)</math>, in canonical cycle notation, if we erase its cycle parentheses, we obtain the permutation <math>(2, 3, 1)</math> in one-line notation. [[Dominique Foata|Foata]]'s transition lemma establishes the nature of this correspondence as a bijection on the set of ''n''-permutations (to itself).{{sfn|Bona|2012|pp=109\u2013110}}  Richard P. Stanley calls this correspondence the ''fundamental bijection''.<ref name=\"Stanley2012\"/> \n\nLet <math>f</math> be the parentheses-erasing transformation. The inverse of <math>q = f(p)</math> is a bit less intuitive. Starting with the one-line notation <math>q = q_1q_2\\cdots q_n</math>, the first cycle in canonical cycle notation must start with <math>q_1</math>. As long as the subsequent elements are smaller than <math>q_1</math>, we are in the same cycle. The second cycle starts at the smallest index <math>j</math> such that <math>q_j > q_1</math>. In other words, <math>q_j</math> is larger than everything else to its left, so it is called a ''left-to-right maximum''. Every cycle in the canonical cycle notation starts with a left-to-right maximum.{{sfn|Bona|2012|pp=109\u2013110}}\n\nFor example, in the one-line notation <math>(3, 1, 2, 5, 4, 8, 9, 7, 6)</math>, 5 is the first element larger than 3, so the first cycle must be <math>(\\,3\\,1\\,2\\,)</math>. Then 8 is the next element larger than 5, so the second cycle is <math>(\\,5\\,4\\,)</math>. Since 9 is larger than 8, <math>(\\,8\\,)</math> is a cycle by itself. Finally, 9 is larger than all the remaining elements to its right, so the last cycle is <math>(\\,9\\,7\\,6\\,)</math>.\n\nAs a first corollary, the number of n-permutations with exactly ''k'' left-to-right maxima is also equal to the signless [[Stirling number of the first kind]], <math>c(n, k)</math>. Furthermore, Foata's mapping takes an ''n''-permutation with ''k''-weak excedances to an ''n''-permutations with {{nowrap|''k'' \u2212 1}} ascents.{{sfn|Bona|2012|pp=109\u2013110}}  For example, (2)(31) = 321 has two weak excedances (at index 1 and 2), whereas {{nowrap|''f''(321) {{=}} 231}} has one ascent (at index 1; i.e., from 2 to 3).\n\n==Permutations of totally ordered sets==\nIn some applications, the elements of the set being permuted will be compared with each other. This requires that the set ''S'' has a [[total order]] so that any two elements can be compared. The set {1, 2, ..., ''n''} is totally ordered by the usual \"\u2264\" relation and so it is the most frequently used set in these applications, but in general, any totally ordered set will do. In these applications, the ordered arrangement view of a permutation is needed to talk about the ''positions'' in a permutation.\n\nThere are a number of properties that are directly related to the total ordering of ''S''.\n\n===Ascents, descents, runs and excedances===\nAn ''ascent'' of a permutation&nbsp;''\u03c3'' of ''n'' is any position ''i''&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;''n'' where the following value is bigger than the current one.

By contrast an ''increasing subsequence'' of a permutation is not necessarily contiguous: it is an increasing sequence of elements obtained from the permutation by omitting the values at some positions.\nFor example, the permutation 2453167 has the ascending runs 245, 3, and 167, while it has an increasing subsequence 2367.\n\nIf a permutation has ''k''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1 descents, then it must be the union of ''k'' ascending runs.{{sfn|B\u00f3na|2004|p=4f}}\n\nThe number of permutations of ''n'' with ''k'' ascents is (by definition) the [[Eulerian number]] <math>\\textstyle\\left\\langle{n\\atop k}\\right\\rangle</math>; this is also the number of permutations of ''n'' with ''k'' descents.

If the inequality is not strict (i.e., {{nowrap|''\u03c3''<sub>''j''</sub> \u2265 ''j''}}), then ''j'' is called a ''weak excedance''. The number of ''n''-permutations with ''k'' excedances coincides with the number of ''n''-permutations with ''k'' descents.{{sfn|Bona|2012|page=25}}\n\n===Inversions===\n{{main|Inversion (discrete mathematics)}}\n[[Image:15-Puzzle.jpg|thumb|In the [[15 puzzle]] the goal is to get the squares in ascending order.

For example, the permutation {{nowrap|''\u03c3'' {{=}} 23154}} has three inversions: (1,3), (2,3), (4,5), for the pairs of entries (2,1), (3,1), (5,4).\n\nSometimes an inversion is defined as the pair of values {{nowrap|(''\u03c3''<sub>''i''</sub>,''\u03c3''<sub>''j''</sub>)}} itself whose order is reversed; this makes no difference for the ''number'' of inversions, and this pair (reversed) is also an inversion in the above sense for the inverse permutation ''\u03c3''<sup>\u22121</sup>. The number of inversions is an important measure for the degree to which the entries of a permutation are out of order; it is the same for ''\u03c3'' and for ''\u03c3''<sup>\u22121</sup>. To bring a permutation with ''k'' inversions into order (i.e., transform it into the identity permutation), by successively applying (right-multiplication by) [[adjacent transposition]]s, is always possible and requires a sequence of ''k'' such operations. Moreover, any reasonable choice for the adjacent transpositions will work: it suffices to choose at each step a transposition of ''i'' and {{nowrap|''i'' + 1}} where ''i'' is a descent of the permutation as modified so far (so that the transposition will remove this particular descent, although it might create other descents). This is so because applying such a transposition reduces the number of inversions by&nbsp;1; as long as this number is not zero, the permutation is not the identity, so it has at least one descent. [[Bubble sort]] and [[insertion sort]] can be interpreted as particular instances of this procedure to put a sequence into order. Incidentally this procedure proves that any permutation ''\u03c3'' can be written as a product of adjacent transpositions; for this one may simply reverse any sequence of such transpositions that transforms ''\u03c3'' into the identity. In fact, by enumerating all sequences of adjacent transpositions that would transform ''\u03c3'' into the identity, one obtains (after reversal) a ''complete'' list of all expressions of minimal length writing ''\u03c3'' as a product of adjacent transpositions.\n\nThe number of permutations of ''n'' with ''k'' inversions is expressed by a Mahonian number,{{sfn|B\u00f3na|2004|pp=43ff}} it is the coefficient of ''X''<sup>''k''</sup> in the expansion of the product\n:<math>\\prod_{m=1}^n\\sum_{i=0}^{m-1}X^i = 1 \\left(1 + X\\right)\\left(1 + X + X^2\\right) \\cdots \\left(1 + X + X^2 + \\cdots + X^{n-1}\\right),</math>\n\nwhich is also known (with ''q'' substituted for ''X'') as the [[q-factorial]] <nowiki>[</nowiki>''n''<nowiki>]</nowiki><sub>''q''</sub>!&nbsp;. The expansion of the product appears in [[Necklace (combinatorics)]].\n\n==Permutations in computing==\n===Numbering permutations===\nOne way to represent permutations of ''n'' is by an integer ''N'' with 0&nbsp;\u2264&nbsp;''N''&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;''n''!, provided convenient methods are given to convert between the number and the representation of a permutation as an ordered arrangement (sequence). This gives the most compact representation of arbitrary permutations, and in computing is particularly attractive when ''n'' is small enough that ''N'' can be held in a machine word; for 32-bit words this means ''n''&nbsp;\u2264&nbsp;12, and for 64-bit words this means ''n''&nbsp;\u2264&nbsp;20. The conversion can be done via the intermediate form of a sequence of numbers ''d''<sub>''n''</sub>, ''d''<sub>''n''\u22121</sub>, ..., ''d''<sub>2</sub>, ''d''<sub>1</sub>, where ''d''<sub>''i''</sub> is a non-negative integer less than ''i'' (one may omit ''d''<sub>1</sub>, as it is always 0, but its presence makes the subsequent conversion to a permutation easier to describe). The first step then is to simply express ''N'' in the ''[[factorial number system]]'', which is just a particular [[mixed radix]] representation, where for numbers up to ''n''! the bases for successive digits are ''n'', {{nowrap|''n'' \u2212 1}}, ..., 2, 1. The second step interprets this sequence as a [[Lehmer code]] or (almost equivalently) as an inversion table.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; text-align:center; margin: 1em\"\n|+ Rothe diagram for <math>\\sigma = (6, 3, 8, 1, 4, 9, 7, 2, 5)</math>\n|-\n! {{diagonal split header|<sub>''i''</sub>| <sup>''\u03c3''<sub>''i''</sub></sup>}}\n! style=\"width:20pt;\"| 1\n! style=\"width:20pt;\"| 2\n! style=\"width:20pt;\"| 3\n! style=\"width:20pt;\"| 4\n! style=\"width:20pt;\"| 5\n! style=\"width:20pt;\"| 6\n! style=\"width:20pt;\"| 7\n! style=\"width:20pt;\"| 8\n! style=\"width:20pt;\"| 9\n!

More precisely, each ''d''<sub>''n''+1\u2212''i''</sub> gives the number of ''remaining'' elements strictly less than the term ''\u03c3''<sub>''i''</sub>. Since those remaining elements are bound to turn up as some later term ''\u03c3''<sub>''j''</sub>, the digit ''d''<sub>''n''+1\u2212''i''</sub> counts the ''inversions'' (''i'',''j'') involving ''i'' as smaller index (the number of values ''j'' for which ''i''&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;''j'' and ''\u03c3''<sub>''i''</sub>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;''\u03c3''<sub>''j''</sub>). The '''inversion table''' for&nbsp;''\u03c3'' is quite similar, but here ''d''<sub>''n''+1\u2212''k''</sub> counts the number of inversions (''i'',''j'') where ''k''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''\u03c3''<sub>''j''</sub> occurs as the smaller of the two values appearing in inverted order.{{sfn|Knuth|1973|p=12}}  Both encodings can be visualized by an ''n''&nbsp;by&nbsp;''n'' '''Rothe diagram'''{{#tag:ref|[[Heinrich August Rothe|H.

Cited in {{harvnb|Knuth|1973|p=14}}}} (named after [[Heinrich August Rothe]]) in which dots at (''i'',''\u03c3''<sub>''i''</sub>) mark the entries of the permutation, and a cross at (''i'',''\u03c3''<sub>''j''</sub>) marks the inversion (''i'',''j''); by the definition of inversions a cross appears in any square that comes both before the dot (''j'',''\u03c3''<sub>''j''</sub>) in its column, and before the dot (''i'',''\u03c3''<sub>''i''</sub>) in its row. The Lehmer code lists the numbers of crosses in successive rows, while the inversion table lists the numbers of crosses in successive columns; it is just the Lehmer code for the inverse permutation, and vice versa.\n\nTo effectively convert a Lehmer code ''d''<sub>''n''</sub>, ''d''<sub>''n''\u22121</sub>, ..., ''d''<sub>2</sub>, ''d''<sub>1</sub> into a permutation of an ordered set ''S'', one can start with a list of the elements of ''S'' in increasing order, and for ''i'' increasing from 1 to ''n'' set ''\u03c3''<sub>''i''</sub> to the element in the list that is preceded by ''d''<sub>''n''+1\u2212''i''</sub> other ones, and remove that element from the list. To convert an inversion table ''d''<sub>''n''</sub>, ''d''<sub>''n''\u22121</sub>, ..., ''d''<sub>2</sub>, ''d''<sub>1</sub> into the corresponding permutation, one can traverse the numbers from ''d''<sub>1</sub> to ''d''<sub>''n''</sub> while inserting the elements of ''S'' from largest to smallest into an initially empty sequence; at the step using the number ''d'' from the inversion table, the element from ''S'' inserted into the sequence at the point where it is preceded by ''d'' elements already present. Alternatively one could process the numbers from the inversion table and the elements of ''S'' both in the opposite order, starting with a row of ''n'' empty slots, and at each step place the element from ''S'' into the empty slot that is preceded by ''d'' other empty slots.\n\nConverting successive natural numbers to the factorial number system produces those sequences in [[lexicographic order]] (as is the case with any mixed radix number system), and further converting them to permutations preserves the lexicographic ordering, provided the Lehmer code interpretation is used (using inversion tables, one gets a different ordering, where one starts by comparing permutations by the ''place'' of their entries 1 rather than by the value of their first entries). The sum of the numbers in the factorial number system representation gives the number of inversions of the permutation, and the parity of that sum gives the [[signature (permutation)|signature]] of the permutation. Moreover, the positions of the zeroes in the inversion table give the values of left-to-right maxima of the permutation (in the example 6, 8, 9) while the positions of the zeroes in the Lehmer code are the positions of the right-to-left minima (in the example positions the 4, 8, 9 of the values 1, 2, 5); this allows computing the distribution of such extrema among all permutations. A permutation with Lehmer code ''d''<sub>''n''</sub>, ''d''<sub>''n''\u22121</sub>, ..., ''d''<sub>2</sub>, ''d''<sub>1</sub> has an ascent {{nowrap|''n'' \u2212 ''i''}} if and only if {{nowrap|''d''<sub>''i''</sub> \u2265 ''d''<sub>''i+1''</sub>}}.\n\n===Algorithms to generate permutations===\nIn computing it may be required to generate permutations of a given sequence of values. The methods best adapted to do this depend on whether one wants some randomly chosen permutations, or all permutations, and in the latter case if a specific ordering is required. Another question is whether possible equality among entries in the given sequence is to be taken into account; if so, one should only generate distinct multiset permutations of the sequence.\n\nAn obvious way to generate permutations of ''n'' is to generate values for the Lehmer code (possibly using the [[factorial number system]] representation of integers up to ''n''!), and convert those into the corresponding permutations. However, the latter step, while straightforward, is hard to implement efficiently, because it requires ''n'' operations each of selection from a sequence and deletion from it, at an arbitrary position; of the obvious representations of the sequence as an [[array data structure|array]] or a [[linked list]], both require (for different reasons) about ''n''<sup>2</sup>/4 operations to perform the conversion. With ''n'' likely to be rather small (especially if generation of all permutations is needed) that is not too much of a problem, but it turns out that both for random and for systematic generation there are simple alternatives that do considerably better. For this reason it does not seem useful, although certainly possible, to employ a special data structure that would allow performing the conversion from Lehmer code to permutation in [[big O notation|''O''(''n'' log ''n'')]] time.\n\n====Random generation of permutations====\n{{Main|Fisher\u2013Yates shuffle}}\nFor generating [[random permutation]]s of a given sequence of ''n'' values, it makes no difference whether one applies a randomly selected permutation of ''n'' to the sequence, or chooses a random element from the set of distinct (multiset) permutations of the sequence. This is because, even though in case of repeated values there can be many distinct permutations of ''n'' that result in the same permuted sequence, the number of such permutations is the same for each possible result. Unlike for systematic generation, which becomes unfeasible for large ''n'' due to the growth of the number ''n''!, there is no reason to assume that ''n'' will be small for random generation.\n\nThe basic idea to generate a random permutation is to generate at random one of the ''n''! sequences of integers ''d''<sub>1</sub>,''d''<sub>2</sub>,...,''d''<sub>''n''</sub> satisfying {{math|0 \u2264 ''d''<sub>''i''</sub> &lt; ''i''}} (since ''d''<sub>1</sub> is always zero it may be omitted) and to convert it to a permutation through a [[bijective]] correspondence. For the latter correspondence one could interpret the (reverse) sequence as a Lehmer code, and this gives a generation method first published in 1938 by [[Ronald Fisher]] and [[Frank Yates]].<ref>{{cite book\n|author1=Fisher, R.A. |author2=Yates, F. | title = Statistical tables for biological, agricultural and medical research\n| origyear = 1938\n| edition = 3rd\n| year = 1948\n| pages = 26\u201327\n| publisher = Oliver & Boyd\n| location = London\n| oclc = 14222135\n}}</ref>\nWhile at the time computer implementation was not an issue, this method suffers from the difficulty sketched above to convert from Lehmer code to permutation efficiently. This can be remedied by using a different bijective correspondence: after using ''d''<sub>''i''</sub> to select an element among ''i'' remaining elements of the sequence (for decreasing values of ''i''), rather than removing the element and compacting the sequence by shifting down further elements one place, one [[swap (computer science)|swaps]] the element with the final remaining element. Thus the elements remaining for selection form a consecutive range at each point in time, even though they may not occur in the same order as they did in the original sequence. The mapping from sequence of integers to permutations is somewhat complicated, but it can be seen to produce each permutation in exactly one way, by an immediate [[induction (mathematics)|induction]]. When the selected element happens to be the final remaining element, the swap operation can be omitted. This does not occur sufficiently often to warrant testing for the condition, but the final element must be included among the candidates of the selection, to guarantee that all permutations can be generated.\n\nThe resulting algorithm for generating a random permutation of <code>''a''[0], ''a''[1], ..., ''a''[''n'' \u2212 1]</code> can be described as follows in [[pseudocode]]:\n\n '''for''' ''i'' '''from''' ''n'' '''downto''' 2 '''do'''\n     ''d<sub>i</sub>'' \u2190 random element of { 0, ..., ''i'' \u2212 1 }\n     '''swap''' ''a''[''d<sub>i</sub>''] and ''a''[''i'' \u2212 1]\n\nThis can be combined with the initialization of the array <code>''a''[''i''] = ''i''</code> as follows\n\n '''for''' ''i'' '''from''' 0 '''to''' ''n''\u22121 '''do'''\n     ''d''<sub>''i''+1</sub> \u2190 random element of { 0, ..., ''i'' }\n     ''a''[''i''] \u2190 ''a''[''d''<sub>''i''+1</sub>]\n     ''a''[''d''<sub>''i''+1</sub>] \u2190 ''i''\n\nIf ''d''<sub>''i''+1</sub> = ''i'', the first assignment will copy an uninitialized value, but the second will overwrite it with the correct value ''i''.\n\nHowever, Fisher-Yates is not the fastest algorithm for generating a permutation, because Fisher-Yates is essentially a sequential algorithm and \"divide and conquer\" procedures can achieve the same result in parallel.<ref>{{cite article|author1=Bacher, A. |author2=Bodini, O.|author3=Hwang, H.K.|author4=Tsai, T.H. | title = Generating Random Permutations by Coin Tossing: Classical Algorithms, New Analysis, and Modern Implementation.\n| edition = ACM Trans.

It can handle repeated values, for which case it generates each distinct multiset permutation once. Even for ordinary permutations it is significantly more efficient than generating values for the Lehmer code in lexicographic order (possibly using the [[factorial number system]]) and converting those to permutations. It begins by sorting the sequence in (weakly) [[increasing]] order (which gives its lexicographically minimal permutation), and then repeats advancing to the next permutation as long as one is found. The method goes back to [[Narayana Pandit]]a in 14th century India, and has been rediscovered frequently.{{sfn|Knuth|2005|pp=1\u201326}}\n\nThe following algorithm generates the next permutation lexicographically after a given permutation. It changes the given permutation in-place.\n\n# Find the largest index ''k'' such that {{nowrap|''a''[''k''] < ''a''[''k'' + 1]}}.  If no such index exists, the permutation is the last permutation.\n# Find the largest index ''l'' greater than k such that {{nowrap|''a''[''k''] < ''a''[''l'']}}.\n# Swap the value of ''a''[''k''] with that of ''a''[''l''].\n# Reverse the sequence from ''a''[''k'' + 1] up to and including the final element ''a''[''n''].\nFor example, given the sequence [1, 2, 3, 4] (which is in increasing order), and given that the index is [[Zero-based numbering|zero-based]], the steps are as follows:\n# Index ''k'' = 2, because 3 is placed at an index that satisfies condition of being the largest index that is still less than ''a''[''k'' + 1] which is 4.\n# Index ''l'' = 3, because 4 is the only value in the sequence that is greater than 3 in order to satisfy the condition ''a''[''k''] < ''a''[''l''].\n# The values of ''a''[2] and ''a''[3] are swapped to form the new sequence [1,2,4,3].\n# The sequence after ''k''-index ''a''[2] to the final element is reversed. Because only one value lies after this index (the 3), the sequence remains unchanged in this instance. Thus the lexicographic successor of the initial state is permuted: [1,2,4,3].\nFollowing this algorithm, the next lexicographic permutation will be [1,3,2,4], and the 24th permutation will be [4,3,2,1] at which point ''a''[''k''] < ''a''[''k'' + 1] does not exist, indicating that this is the last permutation.\n\nThis method uses about 3 comparisons and 1.5 swaps per permutation, amortized over the whole sequence, not counting the initial sort.<ref>{{cite web|title=std::next_permutation|url=http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm/next_permutation|accessdate=31 March 2018|work=cppreference.com|date=4 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n====Generation with minimal changes====\n{{main|Steinhaus\u2013Johnson\u2013Trotter algorithm|Heap's algorithm}}\nAn alternative to the above algorithm, the [[Steinhaus\u2013Johnson\u2013Trotter algorithm]], generates an ordering on all the permutations of a given sequence with the property that any two consecutive permutations in its output differ by swapping two adjacent values.

An alternate permutation of the set {1, 2, ..., 2''n''} is a [[cyclic permutation]] (with no fixed points) such that the digits in the cyclic notation form alternate between odd and even integers. Meandric permutations are useful in the analysis of RNA secondary structure. Not all alternate permutations are meandric. A modification of Heap's algorithm has been used to generate all alternate permutations of order ''n'' (that is, of length 2''n'') without generating all (2''n'')! permutations.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n | last1=Alexiou | first1=A.\n | last2=Psiha | first2=M.\n | last3=Vlamos | first3=P.\n | title= Combinatorial permutation based algorithm for representation of closed RNA secondary structures\n | journal=Bioinformation | year=2011 | volume=7 | issue = 2\n | pages=91\u201395\n | pmc=3174042 | doi=10.6026/97320630007091 | pmid=21938211\n}}</ref>{{unreliable source?|reason=Bioinformation is on Beall's list of questionable journals; it may provide only token peer-review|date=September 2016}} Generation of these alternate permutations is needed before they are analyzed to determine if they are meandric or not.\n\nThe algorithm is recursive. The following table exhibits a step in the procedure. In the previous step, all alternate permutations of length 5 have been generated. Three copies of each of these have a \"6\" added to the right end, and then a different transposition involving this last entry and a previous entry in an even position is applied (including the identity; i.e., no transposition).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The word \"permutation\" also refers to the act or process of changing the linear order of an ordered set.<ref>{{harvtxt|Webster|1969}}</ref>\n\nPermutations differ from [[combination]]s, which are selections of some members of a set regardless of order. For example, written as [[tuple]]s, there are six permutations of the set {1,2,3}, namely: (1,2,3), (1,3,2), (2,1,3), (2,3,1), (3,1,2), and (3,2,1). These are all the possible orderings of this three-element set. [[Anagram]]s of words whose letters are different are also permutations: the letters are already ordered in the original word, and the anagram is a reordering of the letters. The study of permutations of [[finite set]]s is an important topic in the fields of [[combinatorics]] and [[group theory]].\n\nPermutations are used in almost every branch of mathematics, and in many other fields of science. In [[computer science]], they are used for analyzing [[sorting algorithm]]s; in [[quantum physics]], for describing states of particles; and in [[biology]], for describing [[RNA]] sequences. \n\n{{anchor|n-factorial}}The number of permutations of {{math|''n''}} distinct objects is {{math|''n''}}&nbsp;[[factorial]], usually written as {{math|''n''!}}, which means the product of all positive integers less than or equal to {{math|''n''}}.\n\nTechnically, a permutation of a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] {{math|''S''}} is defined as a [[bijection]] from {{math|''S''}} to itself.<ref>{{harvtxt|McCoy|1968|p=152}}</ref><ref>{{harvtxt|Nering|1970|p=86}}</ref>  That is, it is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] from {{math|''S''}} to {{math|''S''}} for which every element occurs exactly once as an [[image (mathematics)|image]] value. This is related to the rearrangement of the elements of {{math|''S''}} in which each element {{math|''s''}} is replaced by the corresponding {{math|''f''(''s'')}}. For example, the permutation (3,1,2) mentioned above is described by the function <math>\\alpha</math> defined as:\n\n: <math>\\alpha(1) = 3, \\quad \\alpha(2) = 1, \\quad \\alpha(3) = 2</math>.\n\nThe collection of all permutations of a set form a [[group (mathematics)|group]] called the [[symmetric group]] of the set. The group operation is the [[function composition|composition]] (performing two given rearrangements in succession), which results in another rearrangement. As properties of permutations do not depend on the nature of the set elements, it is often the permutations of the set <math>\\{1, 2, \\ldots, n\\}</math> that are considered for studying permutations. \n\nIn elementary combinatorics, the {{math|''k''}}-permutations, or [[partial permutation]]s, are the ordered arrangements of {{math|''k''}} distinct elements selected from a set. When {{math|''k''}} is equal to the size of the set, these are the permutations of the set.\n\n[[Image:Rubik's cube.svg|thumb|In the popular puzzle [[Rubik's cube]] invented in 1974 by [[Ern\u0151 Rubik]], each turn of the puzzle faces creates a permutation of the surface colors.]]\n\n==History==\n[[Al-Khalil ibn Ahmad al-Farahidi|Al-Khalil]] (717\u2013786), an [[Mathematics in medieval Islam|Arab mathematician]] and [[cryptographer]], wrote the ''Book of Cryptographic Messages''.

The ''[[Lilavati]]'' by the Indian mathematician [[Bh\u0101skara II|Bhaskara II]] contains a passage that translates to:\n<blockquote>\nThe product of multiplication of the arithmetical series beginning and increasing by unity and continued to the number of places, will be the variations of number with specific figures.<ref>{{cite journal |first=N.

Starting from two bells: \"first, ''two'' must be admitted to be varied in two ways\" which he illustrates by showing 1 2 and 2 1.{{sfn|Stedman|1677|p=4}}  He then explains that with three bells there are \"three times two figures to be produced out of three\" which again is illustrated.  His explanation involves \"cast away 3, and 1.2 will remain; cast away 2, and 1.3 will remain; cast away 1, and 2.3 will remain\".{{sfn|Stedman|1677|p=5}}  He then moves on to four bells and repeats the casting away argument showing that there will be four different sets of three.  Effectively this is a recursive process.  He continues with five bells using the \"casting away\" method and tabulates the resulting 120 combinations.{{sfn|Stedman|1677|pp=6\u20147}}  At this point he gives up and remarks:\n<blockquote>\nNow the nature of these methods is such, that the changes on one number comprehends the changes on all lesser numbers, ... insomuch that a compleat Peal of changes on one number seemeth to be formed by uniting of the compleat Peals on all lesser numbers into one entire body;{{sfn|Stedman|1677|p=8}}\n</blockquote>\nStedman widens the consideration of permutations; he goes on to consider the number of permutations of the letters of the alphabet and of horses from a stable of 20.{{sfn|Stedman|1677|pp=13\u201418}}\n\nA first case in which seemingly unrelated mathematical questions were studied with the help of permutations occurred around 1770, when [[Joseph Louis Lagrange]], in the study of polynomial equations, observed that properties of the permutations of the [[Polynomial#Solving polynomial equations|roots]] of an equation are related to the possibilities to solve it. This line of work ultimately resulted, through the work of [[\u00c9variste Galois]], in [[Galois theory]], which gives a complete description of what is possible and impossible with respect to solving polynomial equations (in one unknown) by radicals. In modern mathematics there are many similar situations in which understanding a problem requires studying certain permutations related to it.\n\n==Definition==\n\nIn mathematics texts it is customary to denote permutations using lowercase Greek letters. Commonly, either <math>\\alpha</math> and <math>\\beta</math>, or <math>\\sigma, \\tau</math> and <math>\\pi</math> are used.<ref name=\"Scheinerman\">{{cite book |last1=Scheinerman |first1=Edward A. |date=March 5, 2012 |chapter=Chapter 5: Functions |title=Mathematics: A Discrete Introduction |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DZBHGD2sEYwC&pg=PA188 |url-status=live |edition=3rd |publisher=Cengage Learning |page=188 |isbn=0840049420 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200205212843/https://books.google.com/books?id=DZBHGD2sEYwC&pg=PA188 |archive-date=February 5, 2020 |access-date=February 5, 2020 |quote=It is customary to use lowercase Greek letters (especially \u03c0, \u03c3, and \u03c4) to stand for permutations.}}</ref>\n\nPermutations can be defined as bijections from a set {{math|''S''}} onto itself. All permutations of a set with ''n'' elements form a [[symmetric group]], denoted <math>S_n</math>, where the [[group operation]] is [[Composition of functions|function composition]]. Thus for two permutations, <math>\\pi</math> and <math>\\sigma</math> in the group <math>S_n</math>, the four group axioms hold: \n\n# [[Closure (mathematics)|Closure]]: If <math>\\pi</math> and <math>\\sigma</math> are in <math>S_n</math> then so is <math>\\pi\\sigma.</math> \n# [[Associativity]]: For any three permutations <math>\\pi, \\sigma, \\tau \\in S_n</math>, <math>(\\pi\\sigma)\\tau = \\pi(\\sigma\\tau).</math>\n# [[Identity element|Identity]]: There is an identity permutation, denoted <math>\\operatorname{id}</math> and defined by <math>\\operatorname{id}(x) = x</math> for all <math>x \\in S</math>.

Is it \"emphasized\" because it\u2019s important? or only for clarity?  -->\nit is emphasized that a permutation is a function that ''performs'' a rearrangement of a set and is not a rearrangement itself. The older and more elementary view holds that permutations are the rearrangements. Sometimes to distinguish these two views, the words ''active'' and ''passive'' forms, or in older terminology ''substitutions'' and ''permutations'' are used.{{sfn|Cameron|1994|loc=p. 29, footnote 3}}\n\nA permutation can be decomposed into one or more disjoint ''cycles'', that is, the [[Orbit (group theory)|orbits]], which are found by repeatedly tracing the application of the permutation on some elements. For example, the permutation <math>\\sigma</math> defined by <math>\\sigma(7) = 7</math> has a 1-cycle, <math>(\\,7\\,)</math> while the permutation <math>\\pi</math> defined by <math>\\pi(2) = 3</math> and <math>\\pi(3) = 2</math> has a 2-cycle <math>(\\,2\\,3\\,)</math> (for details on the syntax see the section [[#Cycle notation|Cycle notation]] below). In general, a cycle of length ''k'', that is, consisting of ''k'' elements, is called a ''k''-cycle.\n\nAn element in a 1-cycle <math>(\\,x\\,)</math> is called a [[Fixed point (mathematics)|fixed point]] of the permutation. A permutation with no fixed points is called a [[derangement]]. 2-cycles are called [[transposition (mathematics)|transpositions]]; such permutations merely exchange two elements, leaving the others fixed.\n\n==Notations==\n{{anchor|Two-line notation}} Since writing permutations elementwise, that is, as [[piecewise]] functions, is cumbersome, several notations have been invented to represent them more compactly. ''Cycle notation'' is a popular choice for many mathematicians due to its compactness and the fact that it makes a permutation's structure transparent. It is the notation used in this article unless otherwise specified, but other notations are still widely used, especially in application areas. \n\n===Two-line notation===\nIn [[Augustin-Louis Cauchy|Cauchy]]'s ''two-line notation'',<ref>{{citation|title=The Genesis of the Abstract Group Concept: A Contribution to the History of the Origin of Abstract Group Theory|first=Hans|last=Wussing|publisher=Courier Dover Publications|year=2007|isbn=9780486458687|page=94|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Xp3JymnfAq4C&pg=PA94|quote=Cauchy used his permutation notation\u2014in which the arrangements are written one below the other and both are enclosed in parentheses\u2014for the first time in 1815.}}</ref> one lists the elements of ''S'' in the first row, and for each one its image below it in the second row. For instance, a particular permutation of the set ''S'' = {1,2,3,4,5} can be written as:\n: <math>\\sigma = \\begin{pmatrix}\n  1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 \\\\\n  2 & 5 & 4 & 3 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix};</math>\nthis means that ''\u03c3'' satisfies {{nowrap|''\u03c3''(1) {{=}} 2}}, {{nowrap|''\u03c3''(2) {{=}} 5}}, {{nowrap|''\u03c3''(3) {{=}} 4}}, {{nowrap|''\u03c3''(4) {{=}} 3}}, and {{nowrap|''\u03c3''(5) {{=}} 1}}. The elements of ''S'' may appear in any order in the first row. This permutation could also be written as:\n: <math>\\sigma = \\begin{pmatrix}\n  3 & 2 & 5 & 1 & 4 \\\\\n  4 & 5 & 1 & 2 & 3\n\\end{pmatrix},</math>\nor\n: <math>\\sigma = \\begin{pmatrix}\n  5 & 1 & 4 & 3 & 2 \\\\\n  1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5\n\\end{pmatrix}.</math>\n\n===One-line notation===\nIf there is a \"natural\" order for the elements of ''S'',{{efn|The order is often implicitly understood. A set of integers is naturally written from smallest to largest; a set of letters is written in lexicographic order.

In mathematics literature, a common usage is to omit parentheses for one-line notation, while using them for cycle notation. The one-line notation is also called the ''[[Word (mathematics)|word]] representation'' of a permutation.<ref name=\"Aigner2007\"/> The example above would then be 2 5 4 3 1 since the natural order 1 2 3 4 5 would be assumed for the first row. (It is typical to use commas to separate these entries only if some have two or more digits.) This form is more compact, and is common in elementary [[combinatorics]] and [[computer science]]. It is especially useful in applications where the elements of ''S'' or the permutations are to be compared as larger or smaller.\n\n===Cycle notation===\nCycle notation describes the effect of repeatedly applying the permutation on the elements of the set. It expresses the permutation as a product of [[cyclic permutation|cycles]]; since distinct cycles are [[disjoint sets|disjoint]], this is referred to as \"decomposition into disjoint cycles\".{{efn|Due to the likely possibility of confusion, cycle notation is not used in conjunction with one-line notation (sequences) for permutations.}}\n\nTo write down the permutation <math>\\sigma</math> in cycle notation, one proceeds as follows:\n\n# Write an opening bracket then select an arbitrary element ''x'' of <math>S</math> and write it down: <math>(\\,x</math>\n# Then trace the orbit of ''x''; that is, write down its values under successive applications of <math>\\sigma</math>: <math>(\\,x\\,\\sigma(x)\\,\\sigma(\\sigma(x))\\,\\ldots</math>\n# Repeat until the value returns to ''x'' and write down a closing parenthesis rather than ''x'': <math>(\\,x\\,\\sigma(x)\\,\\sigma(\\sigma(x))\\,\\ldots\\,)</math>\n# Now continue with an element ''y'' of ''S'', not yet written down, and proceed in the same way: <math>(\\,x\\,\\sigma(x)\\,\\sigma(\\sigma(x))\\,\\ldots\\,)(\\,y\\,\\ldots\\,)</math>\n# Repeat until all elements of ''S'' are written in cycles.\n\nSince for every new cycle the starting point can be chosen in different ways, there are in general many different cycle notations for the same permutation; for the example above one has:\n\n:<math>\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 \\\\\n2 & 5 & 4 & 3 & 1\\end{pmatrix}=\\begin{pmatrix}1 & 2 & 5 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix}3 & 4 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix}3 & 4 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix}1 & 2 & 5 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix}3 & 4 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix}5 & 1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}.</math>\n\n1-cycles are often omitted from the cycle notation, provided that the context is clear; for any element ''x'' in ''S'' not appearing in any cycle, one implicitly assumes <math>\\sigma(x) = x</math>.<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|1959|p=54}}</ref> The [[identity permutation]], which consists only of 1-cycles, can be denoted by a single 1-cycle (x), by the number 1,{{efn|1 is frequently used to represent the [[identity element]] in a non-commutative group}} or by ''id''.<ref>{{harvnb|Rotman|2002|p=41}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Bogart|1990|p=487}}</ref>\n\nA convenient feature of cycle notation is that one can find a permutation's inverse simply by reversing the order of the elements in the permutation's cycles.

However this gives a ''different'' rule for multiplying permutations; this article uses the definition where the rightmost permutation is applied first.\n\n==Other uses of the term ''permutation''==\nThe concept of a permutation as an ordered arrangement admits several generalizations that are not permutations but have been called permutations in the literature.\n\n===''k''-permutations of ''n''===\nA weaker meaning of the term ''permutation'', sometimes used in elementary combinatorics texts, designates those ordered arrangements in which no element occurs more than once, but without the requirement of using all the elements from a given set. These are not permutations except in special cases, but are natural generalizations of the ordered arrangement concept. Indeed, this use often involves considering arrangements of a fixed length&nbsp;''k'' of elements taken from a given set of size ''n'', in other words, these '''''k''-permutations of ''n''''' are the different ordered arrangements of a ''k''-element subset of an ''n''-set (sometimes called '''variations'''  or ''''arrangements'''' in the older literature.{{efn|More precisely, ''variations without repetition''. The term is still common in other languages and appears in modern English most often in translation.}}) These objects are also known as '''[[Partial permutation#Restricted partial permutations|partial permutations]]''' or as '''sequences without repetition''', terms that avoid confusion with the other, more common, meaning of \"permutation\". The number of such <math>k</math>-permutations of <math>n</math> is denoted variously by such symbols as <math>P^n_k</math>,  <math>_nP_k</math>, <math>^nP_k</math>, <math>P_{n,k}</math>, or <math>P(n,k)</math>, and its value is given by the product<ref>{{cite book|author=Charalambides, Ch A.|title=Enumerative Combinatorics|publisher=CRC Press|year=2002|isbn=978-1-58488-290-9|page=42|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PDMGA-v5G54C&pg=PA42}}</ref>\n\n: <math>P(n,k) = \\underbrace{n\\cdot(n-1)\\cdot(n-2)\\cdots(n-k+1)}_{k\\ \\mathrm{factors}}</math>,\nwhich is 0 when {{nowrap|''k'' &gt; ''n''}}, and otherwise is equal to\n: <math>\\frac{n!}{(n-k)!}.</math>\n\nThe product is well defined without the assumption that <math>n</math> is a non-negative integer and is of importance outside combinatorics as well; it is known as the [[Pochhammer symbol]] <math>(n)_k</math> or as the <math>k</math>-th falling factorial power <math>n^{\\underline k}</math> of <math>n</math>.\n\nThis usage of the term ''permutation'' is closely related to the term ''[[combination]]''. A ''k''-element combination of an ''n''-set ''S'' is a ''k'' element subset of ''S'', the elements of which are not ordered. By taking all the ''k'' element subsets of ''S'' and ordering each of them in all possible ways we obtain all the ''k''-permutations of ''S''. The number of ''k''-combinations of an ''n''-set, ''C''(''n'',''k''), is therefore related to the number of ''k''-permutations of ''n'' by:\n: <math>C(n,k) = \\frac{P(n,k)}{P(k,k)} = \\frac{\\tfrac{n!}{(n-k)!}}{\\tfrac{k!}{0!}} = \\frac{n!}{(n-k)!\\,k!}.</math>\n\nThese numbers are also known as [[binomial coefficient]]s and are denoted by <math>\\binom{n}{k}</math>.\n<!--\n\n--- Duplicate of above ... hold for possible inclusion\n\n===Counting sequences without repetition===\nIn this section, a ''k''-permutation of a set ''S'' is an ordered sequence of ''k'' distinct elements of ''S''. For example, given the set of letters {<tt>C</tt>, <tt>E</tt>, <tt>G</tt>, <tt>I</tt>, <tt>N</tt>, <tt>R</tt>}, the sequence <tt>ICE</tt> is a 3-permutation, <tt>RING</tt> and  <tt>RICE</tt> are 4-permutations, <tt>NICER</tt> and <tt>REIGN</tt> are 5-permutations, and <tt>CRINGE</tt> is a 6-permutation; since the latter uses all letters, it is a permutation of the given set in the ordinary combinatorial sense. <tt>ENGINE</tt> on the other hand is not a permutation, because of the repetitions: it uses the elements <tt>E</tt> and <tt>N</tt> twice.\n\nLet ''n'' be the size of ''S'', the number of elements available for selection. In constructing a ''k''-permutation, there are ''n''&nbsp; possible choices for the first element of the sequence, and this is then number of 1-permutations. Once it has been chosen, there are {{nowrap|''n'' \u2212 1}} elements of ''S'' left to choose from, so a second element can be chosen in {{nowrap|''n'' \u2212 1}} ways, giving a total ''n'' \u00d7 (''n'' \u2212 1) possible 2-permutations. For each successive element of the sequence, the number of possibilities decreases by 1&nbsp; which leads to the number of\n:''n'' \u00d7 (''n'' \u2212 1) \u00d7 (''n'' \u2212 2)  ... \u00d7 (''n'' \u2212 ''k'' + 1) possible ''k''-permutations.\nThis gives in particular the number of ''n''-permutations (which contain all elements of ''S'' once, and are therefore simply permutations of ''S''):\n:''n'' \u00d7 (''n'' \u2212 1) \u00d7 (''n'' \u2212 2) \u00d7 ... \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1,\na number that occurs so frequently in mathematics that it is given a compact notation \"''n''!\", and is called \"''n'' [[factorial]]\". These ''n''-permutations are the longest sequences without repetition of elements of ''S'', which is reflected by the fact that the above formula for the number of ''k''-permutations gives zero whenever ''k''&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;''n''.\n\nThe number of ''k''-permutations of a set of ''n'' elements is sometimes denoted by ''P''(''n'',''k'') or a similar notation (usually accompanied by a notation for the number of ''k''-[[combination]]s of a set of ''n'' elements in which the \"''P''\" is replaced by \"''C''\"). That notation is rarely used in other contexts than that of counting ''k''-permutations, but the expression for the number does arise in many other situations. Being a product of ''k'' factors starting at ''n'' and decreasing by unit steps, it is called the ''k''-th falling factorial power of ''n'':\n:<math>n^{\\underline k}=n\\times(n-1)\\times(n-2)\\times\\cdots\\times(n-k+1),</math>\nthough many other names and notations are in use, as detailed at [[Pochhammer symbol]]. When ''k''&nbsp;\u2264&nbsp;''n'' the factorial power can be completed by additional factors: ''n''<sup><u>''k''</u></sup>&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;(''n''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;''k'')!&nbsp;=&nbsp;''n''!, which allows writing\n:<math>n^{\\underline k}=\\frac{n!}{(n-k)!}.</math>\nThe right hand side is often given as expression for the number of ''k''-permutations, but its main merit is using the compact factorial notation. Expressing a product of ''k'' factors as a quotient of potentially much larger products, where all factors in the denominator are also explicitly present in the numerator, is not particularly efficient; as a method of computation there is the additional danger of overflow or rounding errors. It should also be noted that the expression is undefined when ''k''&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;''n'', whereas in those cases the number ''n''<sup><u>''k''</u></sup> of ''k''-permutations is just&nbsp;0.\n-->\n\n===Permutations with repetition===\nOrdered arrangements of the elements of a set ''S'' of length ''n'' where repetition is allowed are called [[Tuple|''n''-tuples]], but have sometimes been referred to as '''permutations with repetition''' although they are not permutations in general. They are also called [[word (mathematics)|words]] over the alphabet ''S'' in some contexts. If the set ''S'' has ''k'' elements, the number of ''n''-tuples over ''S'' is:\n:<math>k^n.</math>\nThere is no restriction on how often an element can appear in an ''n''-tuple, but if restrictions are placed on how often an element can appear, this formula is no longer valid.\n\n===Permutations of multisets===\n[[File:Permutations with repetition.svg|thumb|Permutations of multisets]]\n\nIf ''M'' is a finite [[multiset]], then a '''multiset permutation''' is an ordered arrangement of elements of ''M'' in which each element appears exactly as often as is its multiplicity in ''M''. An [[anagram]] of a word having some repeated letters is an example of a multiset permutation.{{efn|The natural order in this example is the order of the letters in the original word.}} If the multiplicities of the elements of ''M'' (taken in some order) are <math>m_1</math>, <math>m_2</math>, ..., <math>m_l</math> and their sum (i.e., the size of ''M'') is ''n'', then the number of multiset permutations of ''M'' is given by the [[Multinomial coefficient#Multinomial coefficients|multinomial coefficient]],<ref>{{harvnb|Brualdi|2010|loc=p. 46, Theorem 2.4.2}}</ref>\n:<math>{n \\choose m_1, m_2, \\ldots, m_l} = \\frac{n!}{m_1!\\, m_2!\\, \\cdots\\, m_l!}= \\frac{(\\sum_{i=1}^l{m_i})!}\n{\\prod_{i=1}^l{m_i!} }.</math>\n\nFor example, the number of distinct anagrams of the word MISSISSIPPI is:<ref>{{harvnb|Brualdi|2010|p=47}}</ref>\n:<math>\\frac{11!}{1!\\, 4!\\, 4!\\, 2!} = 34650</math>.\n\nA '''k-permutation''' of a multiset ''M'' is a sequence of length ''k'' of elements of ''M'' in which each element appears ''at most'' its multiplicity in ''M'' times (an element's ''repetition number'').\n\n===Circular permutations===\nPermutations, when considered as arrangements, are sometimes referred to as ''linearly ordered'' arrangements. In these arrangements there is a first element, a second element, and so on. If, however, the objects are arranged in a circular manner this distinguished ordering no longer exists, that is, there is no \"first element\" in the arrangement, any element can be considered as the start of the arrangement. The arrangements of objects in a circular manner are called '''circular permutations'''.<ref>{{harvnb|Brualdi|2010|p=39}}</ref>{{efn|In older texts ''circular permutation'' was sometimes used as a synonym for [[cyclic permutation]], but this is no longer done. See {{harvtxt|Carmichael|1956|p=7}}}} These can be formally defined as [[equivalence classes]] of ordinary permutations of the objects, for the [[equivalence relation]] generated by moving the final element of the linear arrangement to its front.\n\nTwo circular permutations are equivalent if one can be rotated into the other (that is, cycled without changing the relative positions of the elements). The following two circular permutations on four letters are considered to be the same.\n\n<pre>\n     1           4\n   4   3       2   1\n     2           3</pre>\n\nThe circular arrangements are to be read counterclockwise, so the following two are not equivalent since no rotation can bring one to the other.\n<pre>\n     1          1\n   4   3      3   4\n     2          2</pre>\n\nThe number of circular permutations of a set ''S'' with ''n'' elements is (''n''&thinsp;\u2013&thinsp;1)!.\n\n==Properties==\nThe number of permutations of {{math|''n''}} distinct objects is {{math|''n''}}!.\n\nThe number of {{math|''n''}}-permutations with {{math|''k''}} disjoint cycles is the signless [[Stirling number of the first kind]], denoted by {{math|''c''(''n'', ''k'')}}.{{sfn|Bona|2012|pp=97\u2013103}}\n\n===Permutation type===\nThe cycles of a permutation partition the set <math>S_n</math> so the lengths of the cycles of a permutation <math>\\sigma</math> forms a [[partition (number theory)|partition]] of ''n'' called the [[cycle type]] of <math>\\sigma</math>. There is a \"1\" in the cycle type for every fixed point of \u03c3, a \"2\" for every transposition, and so on. The cycle type of <math>\\beta = (\\,1\\,2\\,5\\,)(\\,3\\,4\\,)(6\\,8\\,)(\\,7\\,)</math> is (3,2,2,1) which is sometimes written in a more compact form as [1<sup>1</sup>2<sup>2</sup>3<sup>1</sup>]. <!-- Biggs notation -->\n\nThe general form is <math>[1^{\\alpha_1}2^{\\alpha_2}\\dotsm n^{\\alpha_n}]</math>, where <math>\\alpha_1,\\ldots,\\alpha_n</math> are the number of cycles of respective length. The number of partitions of a certain type is then given by:\n: <math>\\frac{n!}{1^{\\alpha_1}2^{\\alpha_2}\\dotsm n^{\\alpha_n}\\alpha_1!\\alpha_2!\\dotsm \\alpha_n!}</math>.\n\n===Conjugating permutations===\nIn general, composing permutations written in cycle notation follows no easily described pattern \u2013 the cycles of the composition can be different from those being composed. However the cycle structure is preserved in the special case of [[conjugacy class|conjugating]] a permutation <math>\\sigma</math> by another permutation <math>\\pi</math>, which means forming the product <math>\\pi\\sigma\\pi^{-1}</math>. Here, <math>\\pi\\sigma\\pi^{-1}</math> is the ''conjugate'' of <math>\\sigma</math> and its cycle notation can be obtained by taking the cycle notation for ''\u03c3'' and applying ''\u03c0'' to all the entries in it.{{sfn|Humphreys|1996|p=84}} It follows that two permutations are conjugate exactly when they have the same type.\n\n===Permutation order===\nThe order of a permutation <math>\\sigma</math> is the smallest positive integer ''m'' so that <math>\\sigma^m = \\mathrm{id}</math>. It is the [[least common multiple]] of its cycles lengths. For example, the order of <math>(\\,1\\,3\\,2)(\\,4\\,5\\,)</math> is <math>2\\cdot3 = 6</math>.\n\n===Parity of a permutation===\nEvery permutation of a finite set can be expressed as the product of transpositions.<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|1959|p=60}}</ref>\nAlthough many such expressions for a given permutation may exist, either they all contain an even or an odd number of transpositions. Thus all permutations can be classified as [[Even and odd permutations|even or odd]] depending on this number.\n\nThis result can be extended so as to assign a ''sign'', written <math>\\operatorname{sgn}\\sigma</math>, to each permutation. <math>\\operatorname{sgn}\\sigma = +1</math> if <math>\\sigma</math> is even and <math>\\operatorname{sgn}\\sigma = -1</math> if <math>\\sigma</math> is odd. Then for two permutations <math>\\sigma</math> and <math>\\pi</math>\n\n: <math>\\operatorname{sgn}(\\sigma\\pi) = \\operatorname{sgn}\\sigma\\cdot\\operatorname{sgn}\\pi.</math>\n\nIt follows that <math>\\operatorname{sgn}(\\sigma\\sigma^{-1}) = +1.</math>\n\n===Matrix representation===\n[[File:Symmetric group 3; Cayley table; matrices.svg|thumb|Composition of permutations corresponds to multiplication of permutation matrices.]]\nOne can represent a permutation of {1, 2, ..., ''n''} as an ''n''\u00d7''n'' [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]]. There are two natural ways to do so, but only one for which multiplications of matrices corresponds to multiplication of permutations in the same order: this is the one that associates to ''\u03c3'' the matrix ''M'' whose entry ''M''<sub>''i'',''j''</sub> is 1 if ''i'' = ''\u03c3''(''j''), and 0 otherwise. The resulting matrix has exactly one entry 1 in each column and in each row, and is called a ''[[permutation matrix]]''. <br />\n[http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6d/Symmetric_group_4%3B_permutation_list_with_matrices.svg/1000px-Symmetric_group_4%3B_permutation_list_with_matrices.svg.png Here] <small>([[:File:Symmetric group 4; permutation list with matrices.svg|file]])</small> is a list of these matrices for permutations of 4 elements. The [[Cayley table]] on the right shows these matrices for permutations of 3 elements.\n\n=== Foata's transition lemma ===\nThere is a relationship between the one-line and the canonical cycle notation. Consider the permutation <math>(\\,2\\,)(\\,3\\,1\\,)</math>, in canonical cycle notation, if we erase its cycle parentheses, we obtain the permutation <math>(2, 3, 1)</math> in one-line notation. [[Dominique Foata|Foata]]'s transition lemma establishes the nature of this correspondence as a bijection on the set of ''n''-permutations (to itself).{{sfn|Bona|2012|pp=109\u2013110}}  Richard P. Stanley calls this correspondence the ''fundamental bijection''.<ref name=\"Stanley2012\"/> \n\nLet <math>f</math> be the parentheses-erasing transformation. The inverse of <math>q = f(p)</math> is a bit less intuitive. Starting with the one-line notation <math>q = q_1q_2\\cdots q_n</math>, the first cycle in canonical cycle notation must start with <math>q_1</math>. As long as the subsequent elements are smaller than <math>q_1</math>, we are in the same cycle. The second cycle starts at the smallest index <math>j</math> such that <math>q_j > q_1</math>. In other words, <math>q_j</math> is larger than everything else to its left, so it is called a ''left-to-right maximum''. Every cycle in the canonical cycle notation starts with a left-to-right maximum.{{sfn|Bona|2012|pp=109\u2013110}}\n\nFor example, in the one-line notation <math>(3, 1, 2, 5, 4, 8, 9, 7, 6)</math>, 5 is the first element larger than 3, so the first cycle must be <math>(\\,3\\,1\\,2\\,)</math>. Then 8 is the next element larger than 5, so the second cycle is <math>(\\,5\\,4\\,)</math>. Since 9 is larger than 8, <math>(\\,8\\,)</math> is a cycle by itself. Finally, 9 is larger than all the remaining elements to its right, so the last cycle is <math>(\\,9\\,7\\,6\\,)</math>.\n\nAs a first corollary, the number of n-permutations with exactly ''k'' left-to-right maxima is also equal to the signless [[Stirling number of the first kind]], <math>c(n, k)</math>. Furthermore, Foata's mapping takes an ''n''-permutation with ''k''-weak excedances to an ''n''-permutations with {{nowrap|''k'' \u2212 1}} ascents.{{sfn|Bona|2012|pp=109\u2013110}}  For example, (2)(31) = 321 has two weak excedances (at index 1 and 2), whereas {{nowrap|''f''(321) {{=}} 231}} has one ascent (at index 1; i.e., from 2 to 3).\n\n==Permutations of totally ordered sets==\nIn some applications, the elements of the set being permuted will be compared with each other. This requires that the set ''S'' has a [[total order]] so that any two elements can be compared. The set {1, 2, ..., ''n''} is totally ordered by the usual \"\u2264\" relation and so it is the most frequently used set in these applications, but in general, any totally ordered set will do. In these applications, the ordered arrangement view of a permutation is needed to talk about the ''positions'' in a permutation.\n\nThere are a number of properties that are directly related to the total ordering of ''S''.\n\n===Ascents, descents, runs and excedances===\nAn ''ascent'' of a permutation&nbsp;''\u03c3'' of ''n'' is any position ''i''&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;''n'' where the following value is bigger than the current one. That is, if  ''\u03c3''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''\u03c3''<sub>1</sub>''\u03c3''<sub>2</sub>...''\u03c3''<sub>''n''</sub>, then ''i'' is an ascent if ''\u03c3''<sub>''i''</sub>&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;''\u03c3''<sub>''i''+1</sub>.\n\nFor example, the permutation 3452167 has ascents (at positions) 1, 2, 5, and 6.\n\nSimilarly, a ''descent'' is a position ''i''&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;''n'' with ''\u03c3''<sub>''i''</sub>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;''\u03c3''<sub>''i''+1</sub>, so every ''i'' with <math>1 \\leq i<n</math> either is an ascent or  is a descent of&nbsp;''\u03c3''.\n\nAn ''ascending run'' of a permutation is a nonempty increasing contiguous subsequence of the permutation that cannot be extended at either end; it corresponds to a maximal sequence of successive ascents (the latter may be empty: between two successive descents there is still an ascending run of length&nbsp;1). By contrast an ''increasing subsequence'' of a permutation is not necessarily contiguous: it is an increasing sequence of elements obtained from the permutation by omitting the values at some positions.\nFor example, the permutation 2453167 has the ascending runs 245, 3, and 167, while it has an increasing subsequence 2367.\n\nIf a permutation has ''k''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1 descents, then it must be the union of ''k'' ascending runs.{{sfn|B\u00f3na|2004|p=4f}}\n\nThe number of permutations of ''n'' with ''k'' ascents is (by definition) the [[Eulerian number]] <math>\\textstyle\\left\\langle{n\\atop k}\\right\\rangle</math>; this is also the number of permutations of ''n'' with ''k'' descents. Some authors however define the Eulerian number <math>\\textstyle\\left\\langle{n\\atop k}\\right\\rangle</math> as the number of permutations with ''k'' ascending runs, which corresponds to {{nowrap|''k'' \u2212 1}} descents.{{sfn|Bona|2012|pages=4\u20135}}\n\nAn excedance of a permutation ''\u03c3''<sub>1</sub>''\u03c3''<sub>2</sub>...''\u03c3''<sub>''n''</sub> in an index ''j'' such that {{nowrap|''\u03c3''<sub>''j''</sub> > ''j''}}. If the inequality is not strict (i.e., {{nowrap|''\u03c3''<sub>''j''</sub> \u2265 ''j''}}), then ''j'' is called a ''weak excedance''. The number of ''n''-permutations with ''k'' excedances coincides with the number of ''n''-permutations with ''k'' descents.{{sfn|Bona|2012|page=25}}\n\n===Inversions===\n{{main|Inversion (discrete mathematics)}}\n[[Image:15-Puzzle.jpg|thumb|In the [[15 puzzle]] the goal is to get the squares in ascending order.  Initial positions which have an odd number of inversions are impossible to solve.<ref name=\"Slocum\">{{cite web\n  | last1     = Slocum\n  | first1    = Jerry\n  | last2     = Weisstein\n  | first2    = Eric W.\n  | title = 15 \u2013 puzzle\n  | work = MathWorld\n  | publisher = Wolfram Research, Inc.\n  | date = 1999\n  | url = http://mathworld.wolfram.com/15Puzzle.html\n  | doi =\n  | accessdate = October 4, 2014\n}}</ref>]]\n\nAn ''[[inversion (discrete mathematics)|inversion]]'' of a permutation&nbsp;''\u03c3'' is a pair {{nowrap|(''i'',''j'')}} of positions where the entries of a permutation are in the opposite order: {{nowrap|''i'' < ''j''}} and {{nowrap|''\u03c3_i'' > ''\u03c3_j''}}.{{sfn|B\u00f3na|2004|p=43}}  So a descent is just an inversion at two adjacent positions. For example, the permutation {{nowrap|''\u03c3'' {{=}} 23154}} has three inversions: (1,3), (2,3), (4,5), for the pairs of entries (2,1), (3,1), (5,4).\n\nSometimes an inversion is defined as the pair of values {{nowrap|(''\u03c3''<sub>''i''</sub>,''\u03c3''<sub>''j''</sub>)}} itself whose order is reversed; this makes no difference for the ''number'' of inversions, and this pair (reversed) is also an inversion in the above sense for the inverse permutation ''\u03c3''<sup>\u22121</sup>. The number of inversions is an important measure for the degree to which the entries of a permutation are out of order; it is the same for ''\u03c3'' and for ''\u03c3''<sup>\u22121</sup>. To bring a permutation with ''k'' inversions into order (i.e., transform it into the identity permutation), by successively applying (right-multiplication by) [[adjacent transposition]]s, is always possible and requires a sequence of ''k'' such operations. Moreover, any reasonable choice for the adjacent transpositions will work: it suffices to choose at each step a transposition of ''i'' and {{nowrap|''i'' + 1}} where ''i'' is a descent of the permutation as modified so far (so that the transposition will remove this particular descent, although it might create other descents). This is so because applying such a transposition reduces the number of inversions by&nbsp;1; as long as this number is not zero, the permutation is not the identity, so it has at least one descent. [[Bubble sort]] and [[insertion sort]] can be interpreted as particular instances of this procedure to put a sequence into order. Incidentally this procedure proves that any permutation ''\u03c3'' can be written as a product of adjacent transpositions; for this one may simply reverse any sequence of such transpositions that transforms ''\u03c3'' into the identity. In fact, by enumerating all sequences of adjacent transpositions that would transform ''\u03c3'' into the identity, one obtains (after reversal) a ''complete'' list of all expressions of minimal length writing ''\u03c3'' as a product of adjacent transpositions.\n\nThe number of permutations of ''n'' with ''k'' inversions is expressed by a Mahonian number,{{sfn|B\u00f3na|2004|pp=43ff}} it is the coefficient of ''X''<sup>''k''</sup> in the expansion of the product\n:<math>\\prod_{m=1}^n\\sum_{i=0}^{m-1}X^i = 1 \\left(1 + X\\right)\\left(1 + X + X^2\\right) \\cdots \\left(1 + X + X^2 + \\cdots + X^{n-1}\\right),</math>\n\nwhich is also known (with ''q'' substituted for ''X'') as the [[q-factorial]] <nowiki>[</nowiki>''n''<nowiki>]</nowiki><sub>''q''</sub>!&nbsp;. The expansion of the product appears in [[Necklace (combinatorics)]].\n\n==Permutations in computing==\n===Numbering permutations===\nOne way to represent permutations of ''n'' is by an integer ''N'' with 0&nbsp;\u2264&nbsp;''N''&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;''n''!, provided convenient methods are given to convert between the number and the representation of a permutation as an ordered arrangement (sequence). This gives the most compact representation of arbitrary permutations, and in computing is particularly attractive when ''n'' is small enough that ''N'' can be held in a machine word; for 32-bit words this means ''n''&nbsp;\u2264&nbsp;12, and for 64-bit words this means ''n''&nbsp;\u2264&nbsp;20. The conversion can be done via the intermediate form of a sequence of numbers ''d''<sub>''n''</sub>, ''d''<sub>''n''\u22121</sub>, ..., ''d''<sub>2</sub>, ''d''<sub>1</sub>, where ''d''<sub>''i''</sub> is a non-negative integer less than ''i'' (one may omit ''d''<sub>1</sub>, as it is always 0, but its presence makes the subsequent conversion to a permutation easier to describe). The first step then is to simply express ''N'' in the ''[[factorial number system]]'', which is just a particular [[mixed radix]] representation, where for numbers up to ''n''! the bases for successive digits are ''n'', {{nowrap|''n'' \u2212 1}}, ..., 2, 1. The second step interprets this sequence as a [[Lehmer code]] or (almost equivalently) as an inversion table.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; text-align:center; margin: 1em\"\n|+ Rothe diagram for <math>\\sigma = (6, 3, 8, 1, 4, 9, 7, 2, 5)</math>\n|-\n! {{diagonal split header|<sub>''i''</sub>| <sup>''\u03c3''<sub>''i''</sub></sup>}}\n! style=\"width:20pt;\"| 1\n! style=\"width:20pt;\"| 2\n! style=\"width:20pt;\"| 3\n! style=\"width:20pt;\"| 4\n! style=\"width:20pt;\"| 5\n! style=\"width:20pt;\"| 6\n! style=\"width:20pt;\"| 7\n! style=\"width:20pt;\"| 8\n! style=\"width:20pt;\"| 9\n!

More precisely, each ''d''<sub>''n''+1\u2212''i''</sub> gives the number of ''remaining'' elements strictly less than the term ''\u03c3''<sub>''i''</sub>. Since those remaining elements are bound to turn up as some later term ''\u03c3''<sub>''j''</sub>, the digit ''d''<sub>''n''+1\u2212''i''</sub> counts the ''inversions'' (''i'',''j'') involving ''i'' as smaller index (the number of values ''j'' for which ''i''&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;''j'' and ''\u03c3''<sub>''i''</sub>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;''\u03c3''<sub>''j''</sub>). The '''inversion table''' for&nbsp;''\u03c3'' is quite similar, but here ''d''<sub>''n''+1\u2212''k''</sub> counts the number of inversions (''i'',''j'') where ''k''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''\u03c3''<sub>''j''</sub> occurs as the smaller of the two values appearing in inverted order.{{sfn|Knuth|1973|p=12}}  Both encodings can be visualized by an ''n''&nbsp;by&nbsp;''n'' '''Rothe diagram'''{{#tag:ref|[[Heinrich August Rothe|H.

Cited in {{harvnb|Knuth|1973|p=14}}}} (named after [[Heinrich August Rothe]]) in which dots at (''i'',''\u03c3''<sub>''i''</sub>) mark the entries of the permutation, and a cross at (''i'',''\u03c3''<sub>''j''</sub>) marks the inversion (''i'',''j''); by the definition of inversions a cross appears in any square that comes both before the dot (''j'',''\u03c3''<sub>''j''</sub>) in its column, and before the dot (''i'',''\u03c3''<sub>''i''</sub>) in its row. The Lehmer code lists the numbers of crosses in successive rows, while the inversion table lists the numbers of crosses in successive columns; it is just the Lehmer code for the inverse permutation, and vice versa.\n\nTo effectively convert a Lehmer code ''d''<sub>''n''</sub>, ''d''<sub>''n''\u22121</sub>, ..., ''d''<sub>2</sub>, ''d''<sub>1</sub> into a permutation of an ordered set ''S'', one can start with a list of the elements of ''S'' in increasing order, and for ''i'' increasing from 1 to ''n'' set ''\u03c3''<sub>''i''</sub> to the element in the list that is preceded by ''d''<sub>''n''+1\u2212''i''</sub> other ones, and remove that element from the list. To convert an inversion table ''d''<sub>''n''</sub>, ''d''<sub>''n''\u22121</sub>, ..., ''d''<sub>2</sub>, ''d''<sub>1</sub> into the corresponding permutation, one can traverse the numbers from ''d''<sub>1</sub> to ''d''<sub>''n''</sub> while inserting the elements of ''S'' from largest to smallest into an initially empty sequence; at the step using the number ''d'' from the inversion table, the element from ''S'' inserted into the sequence at the point where it is preceded by ''d'' elements already present. Alternatively one could process the numbers from the inversion table and the elements of ''S'' both in the opposite order, starting with a row of ''n'' empty slots, and at each step place the element from ''S'' into the empty slot that is preceded by ''d'' other empty slots.\n\nConverting successive natural numbers to the factorial number system produces those sequences in [[lexicographic order]] (as is the case with any mixed radix number system), and further converting them to permutations preserves the lexicographic ordering, provided the Lehmer code interpretation is used (using inversion tables, one gets a different ordering, where one starts by comparing permutations by the ''place'' of their entries 1 rather than by the value of their first entries). The sum of the numbers in the factorial number system representation gives the number of inversions of the permutation, and the parity of that sum gives the [[signature (permutation)|signature]] of the permutation. Moreover, the positions of the zeroes in the inversion table give the values of left-to-right maxima of the permutation (in the example 6, 8, 9) while the positions of the zeroes in the Lehmer code are the positions of the right-to-left minima (in the example positions the 4, 8, 9 of the values 1, 2, 5); this allows computing the distribution of such extrema among all permutations. A permutation with Lehmer code ''d''<sub>''n''</sub>, ''d''<sub>''n''\u22121</sub>, ..., ''d''<sub>2</sub>, ''d''<sub>1</sub> has an ascent {{nowrap|''n'' \u2212 ''i''}} if and only if {{nowrap|''d''<sub>''i''</sub> \u2265 ''d''<sub>''i+1''</sub>}}.\n\n===Algorithms to generate permutations===\nIn computing it may be required to generate permutations of a given sequence of values. The methods best adapted to do this depend on whether one wants some randomly chosen permutations, or all permutations, and in the latter case if a specific ordering is required. Another question is whether possible equality among entries in the given sequence is to be taken into account; if so, one should only generate distinct multiset permutations of the sequence.\n\nAn obvious way to generate permutations of ''n'' is to generate values for the Lehmer code (possibly using the [[factorial number system]] representation of integers up to ''n''!), and convert those into the corresponding permutations. However, the latter step, while straightforward, is hard to implement efficiently, because it requires ''n'' operations each of selection from a sequence and deletion from it, at an arbitrary position; of the obvious representations of the sequence as an [[array data structure|array]] or a [[linked list]], both require (for different reasons) about ''n''<sup>2</sup>/4 operations to perform the conversion. With ''n'' likely to be rather small (especially if generation of all permutations is needed) that is not too much of a problem, but it turns out that both for random and for systematic generation there are simple alternatives that do considerably better. For this reason it does not seem useful, although certainly possible, to employ a special data structure that would allow performing the conversion from Lehmer code to permutation in [[big O notation|''O''(''n'' log ''n'')]] time.\n\n====Random generation of permutations====\n{{Main|Fisher\u2013Yates shuffle}}\nFor generating [[random permutation]]s of a given sequence of ''n'' values, it makes no difference whether one applies a randomly selected permutation of ''n'' to the sequence, or chooses a random element from the set of distinct (multiset) permutations of the sequence. This is because, even though in case of repeated values there can be many distinct permutations of ''n'' that result in the same permuted sequence, the number of such permutations is the same for each possible result. Unlike for systematic generation, which becomes unfeasible for large ''n'' due to the growth of the number ''n''!, there is no reason to assume that ''n'' will be small for random generation.\n\nThe basic idea to generate a random permutation is to generate at random one of the ''n''! sequences of integers ''d''<sub>1</sub>,''d''<sub>2</sub>,...,''d''<sub>''n''</sub> satisfying {{math|0 \u2264 ''d''<sub>''i''</sub> &lt; ''i''}} (since ''d''<sub>1</sub> is always zero it may be omitted) and to convert it to a permutation through a [[bijective]] correspondence. For the latter correspondence one could interpret the (reverse) sequence as a Lehmer code, and this gives a generation method first published in 1938 by [[Ronald Fisher]] and [[Frank Yates]].<ref>{{cite book\n|author1=Fisher, R.A. |author2=Yates, F. | title = Statistical tables for biological, agricultural and medical research\n| origyear = 1938\n| edition = 3rd\n| year = 1948\n| pages = 26\u201327\n| publisher = Oliver & Boyd\n| location = London\n| oclc = 14222135\n}}</ref>\nWhile at the time computer implementation was not an issue, this method suffers from the difficulty sketched above to convert from Lehmer code to permutation efficiently. This can be remedied by using a different bijective correspondence: after using ''d''<sub>''i''</sub> to select an element among ''i'' remaining elements of the sequence (for decreasing values of ''i''), rather than removing the element and compacting the sequence by shifting down further elements one place, one [[swap (computer science)|swaps]] the element with the final remaining element. Thus the elements remaining for selection form a consecutive range at each point in time, even though they may not occur in the same order as they did in the original sequence. The mapping from sequence of integers to permutations is somewhat complicated, but it can be seen to produce each permutation in exactly one way, by an immediate [[induction (mathematics)|induction]]. When the selected element happens to be the final remaining element, the swap operation can be omitted. This does not occur sufficiently often to warrant testing for the condition, but the final element must be included among the candidates of the selection, to guarantee that all permutations can be generated.\n\nThe resulting algorithm for generating a random permutation of <code>''a''[0], ''a''[1], ..., ''a''[''n'' \u2212 1]</code> can be described as follows in [[pseudocode]]:\n\n '''for''' ''i'' '''from''' ''n'' '''downto''' 2 '''do'''\n     ''d<sub>i</sub>'' \u2190 random element of { 0, ..., ''i'' \u2212 1 }\n     '''swap''' ''a''[''d<sub>i</sub>''] and ''a''[''i'' \u2212 1]\n\nThis can be combined with the initialization of the array <code>''a''[''i''] = ''i''</code> as follows\n\n '''for''' ''i'' '''from''' 0 '''to''' ''n''\u22121 '''do'''\n     ''d''<sub>''i''+1</sub> \u2190 random element of { 0, ..., ''i'' }\n     ''a''[''i''] \u2190 ''a''[''d''<sub>''i''+1</sub>]\n     ''a''[''d''<sub>''i''+1</sub>] \u2190 ''i''\n\nIf ''d''<sub>''i''+1</sub> = ''i'', the first assignment will copy an uninitialized value, but the second will overwrite it with the correct value ''i''.\n\nHowever, Fisher-Yates is not the fastest algorithm for generating a permutation, because Fisher-Yates is essentially a sequential algorithm and \"divide and conquer\" procedures can achieve the same result in parallel.<ref>{{cite article|author1=Bacher, A. |author2=Bodini, O.|author3=Hwang, H.K.|author4=Tsai, T.H. | title = Generating Random Permutations by Coin Tossing: Classical Algorithms, New Analysis, and Modern Implementation.\n| edition = ACM Trans.

It can handle repeated values, for which case it generates each distinct multiset permutation once. Even for ordinary permutations it is significantly more efficient than generating values for the Lehmer code in lexicographic order (possibly using the [[factorial number system]]) and converting those to permutations. It begins by sorting the sequence in (weakly) [[increasing]] order (which gives its lexicographically minimal permutation), and then repeats advancing to the next permutation as long as one is found. The method goes back to [[Narayana Pandit]]a in 14th century India, and has been rediscovered frequently.{{sfn|Knuth|2005|pp=1\u201326}}\n\nThe following algorithm generates the next permutation lexicographically after a given permutation. It changes the given permutation in-place.\n\n# Find the largest index ''k'' such that {{nowrap|''a''[''k''] < ''a''[''k'' + 1]}}.  If no such index exists, the permutation is the last permutation.\n# Find the largest index ''l'' greater than k such that {{nowrap|''a''[''k''] < ''a''[''l'']}}.\n# Swap the value of ''a''[''k''] with that of ''a''[''l''].\n# Reverse the sequence from ''a''[''k'' + 1] up to and including the final element ''a''[''n''].\nFor example, given the sequence [1, 2, 3, 4] (which is in increasing order), and given that the index is [[Zero-based numbering|zero-based]], the steps are as follows:\n# Index ''k'' = 2, because 3 is placed at an index that satisfies condition of being the largest index that is still less than ''a''[''k'' + 1] which is 4.\n# Index ''l'' = 3, because 4 is the only value in the sequence that is greater than 3 in order to satisfy the condition ''a''[''k''] < ''a''[''l''].\n# The values of ''a''[2] and ''a''[3] are swapped to form the new sequence [1,2,4,3].\n# The sequence after ''k''-index ''a''[2] to the final element is reversed. Because only one value lies after this index (the 3), the sequence remains unchanged in this instance. Thus the lexicographic successor of the initial state is permuted: [1,2,4,3].\nFollowing this algorithm, the next lexicographic permutation will be [1,3,2,4], and the 24th permutation will be [4,3,2,1] at which point ''a''[''k''] < ''a''[''k'' + 1] does not exist, indicating that this is the last permutation.\n\nThis method uses about 3 comparisons and 1.5 swaps per permutation, amortized over the whole sequence, not counting the initial sort.<ref>{{cite web|title=std::next_permutation|url=http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm/next_permutation|accessdate=31 March 2018|work=cppreference.com|date=4 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n====Generation with minimal changes====\n{{main|Steinhaus\u2013Johnson\u2013Trotter algorithm|Heap's algorithm}}\nAn alternative to the above algorithm, the [[Steinhaus\u2013Johnson\u2013Trotter algorithm]], generates an ordering on all the permutations of a given sequence with the property that any two consecutive permutations in its output differ by swapping two adjacent values.

An alternate permutation of the set {1, 2, ..., 2''n''} is a [[cyclic permutation]] (with no fixed points) such that the digits in the cyclic notation form alternate between odd and even integers. Meandric permutations are useful in the analysis of RNA secondary structure. Not all alternate permutations are meandric. A modification of Heap's algorithm has been used to generate all alternate permutations of order ''n'' (that is, of length 2''n'') without generating all (2''n'')! permutations.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n | last1=Alexiou | first1=A.\n | last2=Psiha | first2=M.\n | last3=Vlamos | first3=P.\n | title= Combinatorial permutation based algorithm for representation of closed RNA secondary structures\n | journal=Bioinformation | year=2011 | volume=7 | issue = 2\n | pages=91\u201395\n | pmc=3174042 | doi=10.6026/97320630007091 | pmid=21938211\n}}</ref>{{unreliable source?|reason=Bioinformation is on Beall's list of questionable journals; it may provide only token peer-review|date=September 2016}} Generation of these alternate permutations is needed before they are analyzed to determine if they are meandric or not.\n\nThe algorithm is recursive. The following table exhibits a step in the procedure. In the previous step, all alternate permutations of length 5 have been generated. Three copies of each of these have a \"6\" added to the right end, and then a different transposition involving this last entry and a previous entry in an even position is applied (including the identity; i.e., no transposition).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The statements were made at and after the [[end of World War II in Asia]], from the 1950s to the 2010s.\n\n==Background==\n (Some Japanease people apologized about the ww2 but the most important thing is Japanease government didn't apologize yet. Many Koreans want apologize but Japanease government is still not answering, and hiding what they did before. They don't teach what they did to Korea.) At the end of the [[Pacific Theater of World War II]], the Imperial Japanese government accepted the terms of the [[Potsdam Declaration]]. In 1945, the unconditional [[surrender of the Empire of Japan]] was formally confirmed aboard the Allied battleship, [[USS Missouri (BB-63)|USS ''Missouri'' (BB-63)]]. Once the formal documents were signed, General [[Douglas MacArthur]], representing the Allies, was named the [[Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers]] in Japan.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=U.S. National Archives and Records Administration |url=https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/featured_documents/japanese_surrender_document/ |title=Instrument of Surrender |date=September 2, 1945}}</ref>\n\nEmperor Hirohito let it be known to General MacArthur that he was prepared to apologize formally to General MacArthur for Japan's actions during World War II\u2014including an apology for the December 7, 1941, [[attack on Pearl Harbor]].<ref name=\"slt2006\">{{cite news |last=LaPlante |first=Matthew D. |url=http://www.sltrib.com/ci_4794305 |title=MacArthur aide: U.S. must learn from errors |newspaper=[[Salt Lake Tribune]] |date=December 7, 2006 |accessdate=2012-10-02}}</ref>\n\n===Apology rebuffed===\nIn one version of the formal apology, [[Emperor Hirohito]], the Japanese monarch, is reported to have said to General MacArthur: \"I come before you to offer myself to the judgment of the powers you represent, as one to bear sole responsibility for every political and military decision made and action taken by my people in the conduct of the war.\"<ref>{{cite journal |title=Honesty, not apology |journal=[[The Economist]] |date=August 21, 1993 |volume=328 |number=7825 |page=17 |id=Gale Document Number: A14258166}}</ref>\n\nIn a second version of the formal apology, [[Patrick Lennox Tierney]] claims that he was an eyewitness when the Emperor came to the Allied Supreme Commander's headquarters to present this apology.

This was the same floor where MacArthur's suite was situated.<ref name=\"slt2006\"/> Tierney reported that when the emperor arrived, MacArthur refused to admit him or acknowledge him, and the pivotal moment passed.\n\nMany years later, Tierney made an effort to explain his understanding of the significance of what he claimed he had personally witnessed: \"Apology is a very important thing in Japan.

Japan has recognized, in the Japan-ROK Joint Communique, of 1965, that the 'past relations are regrettable, and Japan feels deep remorse,' and in the Japan-China Joint Communique, that Japan is 'keenly conscious of the responsibility for the serious damage that Japan caused in the past to the Chinese people through war and deeply reproaches itself.'

The episode was reported by Darwin in his diaries of [[the Voyage of the Beagle]] as occurring in March 1835 to the east of the [[Andes]] near [[Mendoza Province|Mendoza]]. Darwin was young and generally in good health, though six months previously he had been ill for a month near [[Valparaiso]], but in 1837, almost a year after he returned to England, he began to suffer intermittently from a strange group of [[symptom]]s, becoming incapacitated for much of the rest of his life. Attempts to test Darwin's remains at [[Westminster Abbey]] by using modern [[PCR]] techniques were met with a refusal by the Abbey's [[curator]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Adler D |title=Darwin's Illness |journal=Isr J Med Sci |volume=25 |issue=4 |pages=218\u201321 |year=1989 |pmid=2496051}}</ref>\n\n==Research==\n{{update-section|date=February 2020}}\nAs of 2007, Several experimental treatments showed promise in animal models.
