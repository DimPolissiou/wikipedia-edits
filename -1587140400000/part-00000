In 1241, it took [[Chengdu]] again, nearing [[Kuizhou]], and the Sichuan defense line was nearly destroyed. In 1241, Yu Jie moved the military and political center of Sichuan from Chengdu to Chongqing, which was easier to defend. After understanding that defending on flat land failed to stop the Mongol army, Yu began to build a mountain defense system and relocated the state government offices in the Sichuan province into the [[Daba Mountains]].<ref name=\"\u5b8b\u5143\u6218\u4e89\u4e2d\u56db\u5ddd\u7684\u5b8b\u519b\u5c71\u57ce\u53ca\u5176\u73b0\u72b6\"/> Most of the fortresses were located near cliffs of the mountains. The top of the mountains were wide and flat, there was enough [[arable land]] and water, so they were self-sufficient and could be defended for a long time. At the same time, the mountain cities were often connected by rivers and roads at the junction of valleys or rivers. The defense of the Southern Song Dynasty used [[Chongqing]], [[Jiading]] and [[Kuizhou|Kuimen]] as the centers of the defense of Sichuan, which resisted the invasion of Mongolia for 53 years. Even after the [[Battle of Yamen]] in 1279, which ended the [[Southern Song dynasty]], two of the fortresses (Santaicheng and Lingxiaocheng) had not fallen. The former lasted for an extra year until 1280, and the latter lasted until 1288, making it the last place under Song control.\n\n== List ==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Name\n!Year of

The defense of the Southern Song Dynasty used [[Chongqing]], [[Jiading]] and [[Kuizhou|Kuimen]] as the centers of the defense of Sichuan, which resisted the invasion of Mongolia for 53 years. Even after the [[Battle of Yamen]] in 1279, which ended the [[Southern Song dynasty]], two of the fortresses (Santaicheng and Lingxiaocheng) had not fallen.

It also explores the power one person has to elicit change. The jury members are identified only by number; no names are revealed until an exchange of dialogue at the very end.

The film is also notable for its almost exclusive use of one set, where all but three minutes of the film takes place.\n\nIn 2007, the film was selected for the [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".<ref name=\"12AngryMen1957film-r1\" /> The film was selected as the second-best courtroom drama ever by the American Film Institute during their AFI's 10 Top 10 list.<ref name=\"AFI's 10 Top 10 Courtroom Drama\">{{cite news | publisher = [[American Film Institute]] | title = AFI's 10 Top 10 Courtroom Drama | date = 2008-06-17 | url = https://www.afi.com/afis-10-top-10/ | accessdate=2014-11-29}}</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\n{{Long plot|date=April 2020}}\nIn the [[New York County Courthouse]], a [[judge]] instructs a [[jury]] about to deliberate the case of an 18-year-old youth from a [[slum]] on trial for allegedly stabbing his father to death that if there is any [[reasonable doubt]], the jurors are to return a verdict of not guilty. If found guilty, the defendant will receive a [[Capital punishment|death sentence]].<ref>http://www.umass.edu/legal/Hilbink/250/12Angry.pdf, see page 8 of PDF</ref> The jury is further instructed that the verdict must be unanimous.\n\nThe evidence seems convincing, with testimony from the neighbor across the street who said she witnessed the defendant stab his father from her window. Further, the elderly neighbor in the apartment below testified that he heard the defendant shout at his father that he would kill him, and then, through his door's peephole, saw him run past his door.\n\nIn a preliminary vote, all jurors vote \"guilty\" except Juror 8, who reasons that there should be some discussion about the case before quickly reaching a \"guilty\" verdict and also brings up the defendant's rough upbringing. He questions the reliability of the two witnesses and the prosecution's claim that the murder weapon, a switchblade, was \"rare\" and produces an identical knife. Juror 8 argues that he cannot vote \"guilty\" because reasonable doubt exists.\n\nHaving [[Hung jury|hung the jury]], Juror 8 suggests a secret ballot among the other eleven; if all the remaining jurors still vote \"guilty\", he will acquiesce. The ballot reveals one \"not guilty\" vote. Juror 3 accuses Juror 5, who grew up in a slum, of changing his vote out of sympathy, but Juror 9 reveals that he changed his vote, agreeing there should be some more discussion.\n\nJuror 8 argues that the noise of a passing train would have obscured the threat that one witness claimed to have heard the defendant tell his father: \"I'm going to kill you\". Juror 5 changes his vote, as does Juror 11, who believes the defendant, having returned to the apartment and been met by the police, was not trying to retrieve the murder weapon as it had already been cleaned of fingerprints. Juror 8 points out that people often say \"I'm going to kill you\" without literally meaning it.\n\nJurors 5, 6, and 8 question the witness's ability to have made it to his door in time to see the defendant fleeing 15 seconds after hearing the father's body hit the floor. Juror 3 is infuriated, and Juror 8 accuses him of being a [[Sadistic personality disorder|sadistic]] public avenger. Juror 3 tries to attack Juror 8, shouting \"I'll kill him!\", and Juror 8 calmly replies, \"You don't really mean you'll kill me, do you?\" proving his previous point. Jurors 2 and 6 then change their votes, tying the verdict 6\u20136 as a [[thunderstorm]] begins.\n\nJuror 4 doubts the defendant's alibi, based on the boy's inability to recall certain details, and Juror 8 tests Juror 4's own memory. He is able to remember events from the previous seven days though with some difficulty. Juror 2 questions the likelihood that the defendant, being seven inches shorter than his father, could have inflicted the downward stab wound. Jurors 3 and 8 act this out which confirms the possibility. However, Juror 5 demonstrates the correct way to hold and use a switchblade, proving that someone skilled with a switchblade, as the boy would have been, would always stab underhand at an upwards angle against a taller opponent.\n\nImpatient to leave due to having tickets to that night's baseball game, Juror 7 changes his vote and earns the ire of other jurors, and is confronted by juror 11; he insists that he thinks the defendant is not guilty but doesn't explain why. Jurors 1 and 12 then change their votes, leaving only Jurors 3, 4, and 10. Juror 10 erupts in vitriol against slum people. One by one, the rest of the jurors, except 7 and 4, turn their backs to him and Juror 4 tells him to \"sit down and don't open your mouth again\". Juror 8 reminds the rest that personal prejudice can cloud judgments. Juror 4 declares that the woman who saw the killing from across the street stands as solid evidence. Juror 12 reverts his vote, making the vote 8\u20134.\n\nJuror 9, seeing Juror 4 rub his nose, irritated by his glasses, realizes that the witness had impressions on her nose, suggesting that she wears glasses but did not wear them in court. Other jurors confirm the same, and Juror 8 adds that she would not have worn them to bed, and the attack happened so swiftly that she would not have had time to put them on. Jurors 12, 10 and 4 then change their vote to \"not guilty\", leaving only Juror 3.\n\nJuror 3 gives an increasingly tortured string of arguments, building on earlier remarks about his strained relationship with his own son, the reason he wants the accused to be guilty. He tears up a photograph of him and his son and almost immediately breaks down sobbing and mutters \"not guilty\", making the vote unanimous. As the rest leave, Juror 8 helps the distraught Juror 3 with his coat in a show of compassion. The defendant is found \"not guilty\" off-screen and the jurors leave the courthouse. In a brief epilogue on the courthouse steps, Jurors 8 and 9 introduce each other for the first time by their names (Davis and McCardle respectively) before parting.\n\n== Cast ==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

A complete [[kinescope]] of that performance, which had been missing for years and was feared lost, was discovered in 2003. It was staged at [[Chelsea Studios]] in New York City.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wDpSaPkSt-8C&pg=PA231|title=New York: The Movie Lover's Guide: The Ultimate Insider Tour of Movie New York|first=Richard|last=Alleman|publisher=Broadway Books|date=February 1, 2005|page=231|isbn=978-0-7679-1634-9}}</ref>\n\nThe success of the television production resulted in a film adaptation. [[Sidney Lumet]], whose prior directorial credits included dramas for television productions such as ''[[The Alcoa Hour]]'' and ''[[Studio One (CBS series)|Studio One]]'', was recruited by Henry Fonda and Rose to direct. ''12 Angry Men'' was Lumet's first feature film, and the only producing credit for Fonda and Rose (under the production company, Orion-Nova Productions).<ref name=Variety /> Fonda later stated that he would never again produce a film.\n\nThe film was shot in New York and completed after a short but rigorous rehearsal schedule, in less than three weeks, on a budget of $337,000 ({{Inflation|US|337000|1957|r=-3|fmt=eq}}). Rose and Fonda took salary deferrals.<ref name=Variety />\n\nAt the beginning of the film, the cameras are positioned above eye level and mounted with [[wide-angle lens]]es, to give the appearance of greater depth between subjects, but as the film progresses the [[focal length]] of the lenses is gradually increased. By the end of the film, nearly everyone is shown in closeup, using [[telephoto lens]]es from a lower angle, which decreases or \"shortens\" [[depth of field]]. Lumet stated that his intention in using these techniques with cinematographer [[Boris Kaufman]] was to create a nearly palpable [[claustrophobia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.playhousesquare.org/bbuzz/12angrymen/d-evolution.html |title=Evolution of Twelve Angry Men|website=Playhouse Square |archivedate=January 6, 2009 |accessdate=September 11, 2008 |url-status=dead  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106012115/http://www.playhousesquare.org/bbuzz/12angrymen/d-evolution.html }}</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\n\n=== Initial response ===\nOn its first release, ''12 Angry Men'' received critical acclaim.

She was particularly inspired by immigrant Juror 11's monologue on his reverence for the American justice system. She also told the audience of law students that, as a lower-court judge, she would sometimes instruct juries to not follow the film's example, because most of the jurors' conclusions are based on speculation, not fact.<ref>{{Citation| last = Semple | first = Kirk| title = The Movie That Made a Supreme Court Justice| newspaper = The New York Times| date = October 18, 2010| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/18/nyregion/18sonia.html| accessdate =October 18, 2010}}</ref> Sotomayor noted that events such as Juror 8 entering a similar knife into the proceeding; performing outside research into the case matter in the first place; and ultimately the jury as a whole making broad, wide-ranging assumptions far beyond the scope of reasonable doubt (such as the inferences regarding the woman wearing glasses) would not be allowed in a real-life jury situation, and would in fact have yielded a [[mistrial (law)|mistrial]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nycourts.gov/cji/1-General/CJI2d.Jury_Admonitions.pdf |title=Jury Admonitions In Preliminary Instructions (Revised May 5, 2009)1 |accessdate=June 23, 2011}}</ref> (assuming, of course, that applicable law permitted the content of jury deliberations to be revealed).\n\nThere have been a number of adaptations. A 1963 German TV production ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Die zw\u00f6lf Geschworenen|de|3=Die zw\u00f6lf Geschworenen (1963)}}'' was directed by G\u00fcnter Gr\u00e4wert, while a 1991 homage by [[K\u014dki Mitani]], ''Juninin no Yasashii Nihonjin'' (\"12 gentle Japanese\"), posits a Japan with a jury system and features a group of Japanese people grappling with their responsibility in the face of Japanese cultural norms. The 1987 Indian film in [[Hindi]] language ''[[Ek Ruka Hua Faisla]]'' (\"a pending decision\") and also in [[Kannada]] as ''[[Dashamukha]]'' (\"ten faces\") are the remakes of the film, with an almost identical storyline. Russian director [[Nikita Mikhalkov]] also made a 2007 adaptation, ''[[12 (2007 film)|12]]'', featuring a Chechen teen on trial in Moscow. A 2015 Chinese adaptation, ''[[12 Citizens]]'', follows the plot of the original 1957 American movie, while including characters reflecting contemporary Beijing society, including a cab driver, guard, businessman, policeman, a retiree persecuted in a 1950s political movement, and others.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/12-citizens-shanghai-review-804416|title='12 Citizens' Shanghai Review|first=Deborah|last=Young|magazine=Hollywood Reporter|date=2015-06-23|accessdate=2015-08-23}}</ref> The detective drama television show ''[[Veronica Mars]]'', which like the film includes the theme of class issues, featured an episode, \"[[One Angry Veronica]]\", in which the title character is selected for jury duty. The episode flips the film's format and depicts one holdout convincing the jury to ''convict'' the privileged defendants of assault against a less well-off victim, despite their lawyers initially convincing 11 jury members of a not guilty verdict.\n\nIn 1997, a television remake of the film [[12 Angry Men (1997 film)|under the same title]] was directed by [[William Friedkin]] and produced by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]. In the newer version, the judge is a woman and four of the jurors are black, but the overall plot remains intact. Modernizations include not smoking in the jury room, changes in references to pop culture figures and income, references to execution by lethal injection as opposed to the electric chair, more race-related dialogue and profanity.\n\nThe film has also been subject to parody. In 2015, the [[Comedy Central]] TV series ''[[Inside Amy Schumer]]'' aired a half-hour parody of the film titled \"12 Angry Men Inside Amy Schumer\".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.vulture.com/2015/05/amy-schumer-12-angry-men-pictures.html |title= Behold Inside Amy Schumer's Dead-On ''12 Angry Men''\n |last = Lyons | first = Margaret |work=[[New York (magazine)#Digital expansion and blogs|Vulture]] |accessdate=May 6, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/monkeysee/2015/05/06/404649955/amy-schumer-puts-her-own-looks-on-trial |title= Amy Schumer Puts Her Own Looks On Trial\n |last = Homes | first = Linda |work=[[NPR]] |accessdate=May 6, 2015}}</ref> BBC Radio comedy ''[[Hancock's Half Hour]]'', starring [[Tony Hancock]] and [[Sid James]], and written by Ray Galton and Alan Simpson, broadcast a half-hour parody on October 16, 1959, also known as ''[[Twelve Angry Men (Hancock's Half Hour)|Twelve Angry Men]]''.

''[[Family Guy]]'' paid tribute to the film with its Season 11 episode titled \"[[12 and a Half Angry Men]]\", and ''[[King of The Hill]]'' acknowledged the film with their parody \"Nine Pretty Darn Angry Men\" in season 3. Sitcom ''Happy Days'' also features a similar story in the season 5 episode \"Fonzie for the Defense\", when Howard Cunningham and Fonzie are picked for a jury, and Fonzie is the lone hold-out for innocence, swaying the rest of the jury.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0596193/|title=\"Happy Days\" Fonzie for the Defense (TV Episode 1978)|work=IMDb}}</ref> ''Saturday Night Live'' parodied the film in 1984 in a sketch called First Draft Theater.

It also explores the power one person has to elicit change. The jury members are identified only by number; no names are revealed until an exchange of dialogue at the very end. The film forces the characters and audience to evaluate their own self-image through observing the personality, experiences, and actions of the jurors. The film is also notable for its almost exclusive use of one set, where all but three minutes of the film takes place.\n\nIn 2007, the film was selected for the [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".<ref name=\"12AngryMen1957film-r1\" /> The film was selected as the second-best courtroom drama ever by the American Film Institute during their AFI's 10 Top 10 list.<ref name=\"AFI's 10 Top 10 Courtroom Drama\">{{cite news | publisher = [[American Film Institute]] | title = AFI's 10 Top 10 Courtroom Drama | date = 2008-06-17 | url = https://www.afi.com/afis-10-top-10/ | accessdate=2014-11-29}}</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\n{{Long plot|date=April 2020}}\nIn the [[New York County Courthouse]], a [[judge]] instructs a [[jury]] about to deliberate the case of an 18-year-old youth from a [[slum]] on trial for allegedly stabbing his father to death that if there is any [[reasonable doubt]], the jurors are to return a verdict of not guilty. If found guilty, the defendant will receive a [[Capital punishment|death sentence]].<ref>http://www.umass.edu/legal/Hilbink/250/12Angry.pdf, see page 8 of PDF</ref> The jury is further instructed that the verdict must be unanimous.\n\nThe evidence seems convincing, with testimony from the neighbor across the street who said she witnessed the defendant stab his father from her window. Further, the elderly neighbor in the apartment below testified that he heard the defendant shout at his father that he would kill him, and then, through his door's peephole, saw him run past his door.\n\nIn a preliminary vote, all jurors vote \"guilty\" except Juror 8, who reasons that there should be some discussion about the case before quickly reaching a \"guilty\" verdict and also brings up the defendant's rough upbringing. He questions the reliability of the two witnesses and the prosecution's claim that the murder weapon, a switchblade, was \"rare\" and produces an identical knife. Juror 8 argues that he cannot vote \"guilty\" because reasonable doubt exists.\n\nHaving [[Hung jury|hung the jury]], Juror 8 suggests a secret ballot among the other eleven; if all the remaining jurors still vote \"guilty\", he will acquiesce. The ballot reveals one \"not guilty\" vote. Juror 3 accuses Juror 5, who grew up in a slum, of changing his vote out of sympathy, but Juror 9 reveals that he changed his vote, agreeing there should be some more discussion.\n\nJuror 8 argues that the noise of a passing train would have obscured the threat that one witness claimed to have heard the defendant tell his father: \"I'm going to kill you\". Juror 5 changes his vote, as does Juror 11, who believes the defendant, having returned to the apartment and been met by the police, was not trying to retrieve the murder weapon as it had already been cleaned of fingerprints. Juror 8 points out that people often say \"I'm going to kill you\" without literally meaning it.\n\nJurors 5, 6, and 8 question the witness's ability to have made it to his door in time to see the defendant fleeing 15 seconds after hearing the father's body hit the floor. Juror 3 is infuriated, and Juror 8 accuses him of being a [[Sadistic personality disorder|sadistic]] public avenger. Juror 3 tries to attack Juror 8, shouting \"I'll kill him!\", and Juror 8 calmly replies, \"You don't really mean you'll kill me, do you?\" proving his previous point. Jurors 2 and 6 then change their votes, tying the verdict 6\u20136 as a [[thunderstorm]] begins.\n\nJuror 4 doubts the defendant's alibi, based on the boy's inability to recall certain details, and Juror 8 tests Juror 4's own memory. He is able to remember events from the previous seven days though with some difficulty. Juror 2 questions the likelihood that the defendant, being seven inches shorter than his father, could have inflicted the downward stab wound. Jurors 3 and 8 act this out which confirms the possibility. However, Juror 5 demonstrates the correct way to hold and use a switchblade, proving that someone skilled with a switchblade, as the boy would have been, would always stab underhand at an upwards angle against a taller opponent.\n\nImpatient to leave due to having tickets to that night's baseball game, Juror 7 changes his vote and earns the ire of other jurors, and is confronted by juror 11; he insists that he thinks the defendant is not guilty but doesn't explain why. Jurors 1 and 12 then change their votes, leaving only Jurors 3, 4, and 10. Juror 10 erupts in vitriol against slum people. One by one, the rest of the jurors, except 7 and 4, turn their backs to him and Juror 4 tells him to \"sit down and don't open your mouth again\". Juror 8 reminds the rest that personal prejudice can cloud judgments. Juror 4 declares that the woman who saw the killing from across the street stands as solid evidence. Juror 12 reverts his vote, making the vote 8\u20134.\n\nJuror 9, seeing Juror 4 rub his nose, irritated by his glasses, realizes that the witness had impressions on her nose, suggesting that she wears glasses but did not wear them in court. Other jurors confirm the same, and Juror 8 adds that she would not have worn them to bed, and the attack happened so swiftly that she would not have had time to put them on. Jurors 12, 10 and 4 then change their vote to \"not guilty\", leaving only Juror 3.\n\nJuror 3 gives an increasingly tortured string of arguments, building on earlier remarks about his strained relationship with his own son, the reason he wants the accused to be guilty. He tears up a photograph of him and his son and almost immediately breaks down sobbing and mutters \"not guilty\", making the vote unanimous. As the rest leave, Juror 8 helps the distraught Juror 3 with his coat in a show of compassion. The defendant is found \"not guilty\" off-screen and the jurors leave the courthouse. In a brief epilogue on the courthouse steps, Jurors 8 and 9 introduce each other for the first time by their names (Davis and McCardle respectively) before parting.\n\n== Cast ==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

A complete [[kinescope]] of that performance, which had been missing for years and was feared lost, was discovered in 2003. It was staged at [[Chelsea Studios]] in New York City.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wDpSaPkSt-8C&pg=PA231|title=New York: The Movie Lover's Guide: The Ultimate Insider Tour of Movie New York|first=Richard|last=Alleman|publisher=Broadway Books|date=February 1, 2005|page=231|isbn=978-0-7679-1634-9}}</ref>\n\nThe success of the television production resulted in a film adaptation. [[Sidney Lumet]], whose prior directorial credits included dramas for television productions such as ''[[The Alcoa Hour]]'' and ''[[Studio One (CBS series)|Studio One]]'', was recruited by Henry Fonda and Rose to direct. ''12 Angry Men'' was Lumet's first feature film, and the only producing credit for Fonda and Rose (under the production company, Orion-Nova Productions).<ref name=Variety /> Fonda later stated that he would never again produce a film.\n\nThe film was shot in New York and completed after a short but rigorous rehearsal schedule, in less than three weeks, on a budget of $337,000 ({{Inflation|US|337000|1957|r=-3|fmt=eq}}). Rose and Fonda took salary deferrals.<ref name=Variety />\n\nAt the beginning of the film, the cameras are positioned above eye level and mounted with [[wide-angle lens]]es, to give the appearance of greater depth between subjects, but as the film progresses the [[focal length]] of the lenses is gradually increased. By the end of the film, nearly everyone is shown in closeup, using [[telephoto lens]]es from a lower angle, which decreases or \"shortens\" [[depth of field]]. Lumet stated that his intention in using these techniques with cinematographer [[Boris Kaufman]] was to create a nearly palpable [[claustrophobia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.playhousesquare.org/bbuzz/12angrymen/d-evolution.html |title=Evolution of Twelve Angry Men|website=Playhouse Square |archivedate=January 6, 2009 |accessdate=September 11, 2008 |url-status=dead  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106012115/http://www.playhousesquare.org/bbuzz/12angrymen/d-evolution.html }}</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\n\n=== Initial response ===\nOn its first release, ''12 Angry Men'' received critical acclaim.

She was particularly inspired by immigrant Juror 11's monologue on his reverence for the American justice system. She also told the audience of law students that, as a lower-court judge, she would sometimes instruct juries to not follow the film's example, because most of the jurors' conclusions are based on speculation, not fact.<ref>{{Citation| last = Semple | first = Kirk| title = The Movie That Made a Supreme Court Justice| newspaper = The New York Times| date = October 18, 2010| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/18/nyregion/18sonia.html| accessdate =October 18, 2010}}</ref> Sotomayor noted that events such as Juror 8 entering a similar knife into the proceeding; performing outside research into the case matter in the first place; and ultimately the jury as a whole making broad, wide-ranging assumptions far beyond the scope of reasonable doubt (such as the inferences regarding the woman wearing glasses) would not be allowed in a real-life jury situation, and would in fact have yielded a [[mistrial (law)|mistrial]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nycourts.gov/cji/1-General/CJI2d.Jury_Admonitions.pdf |title=Jury Admonitions In Preliminary Instructions (Revised May 5, 2009)1 |accessdate=June 23, 2011}}</ref> (assuming, of course, that applicable law permitted the content of jury deliberations to be revealed).\n\nThere have been a number of adaptations. A 1963 German TV production ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Die zw\u00f6lf Geschworenen|de|3=Die zw\u00f6lf Geschworenen (1963)}}'' was directed by G\u00fcnter Gr\u00e4wert, while a 1991 homage by [[K\u014dki Mitani]], ''Juninin no Yasashii Nihonjin'' (\"12 gentle Japanese\"), posits a Japan with a jury system and features a group of Japanese people grappling with their responsibility in the face of Japanese cultural norms. The 1987 Indian film in [[Hindi]] language ''[[Ek Ruka Hua Faisla]]'' (\"a pending decision\") and also in [[Kannada]] as ''[[Dashamukha]]'' (\"ten faces\") are the remakes of the film, with an almost identical storyline. Russian director [[Nikita Mikhalkov]] also made a 2007 adaptation, ''[[12 (2007 film)|12]]'', featuring a Chechen teen on trial in Moscow. A 2015 Chinese adaptation, ''[[12 Citizens]]'', follows the plot of the original 1957 American movie, while including characters reflecting contemporary Beijing society, including a cab driver, guard, businessman, policeman, a retiree persecuted in a 1950s political movement, and others.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/12-citizens-shanghai-review-804416|title='12 Citizens' Shanghai Review|first=Deborah|last=Young|magazine=Hollywood Reporter|date=2015-06-23|accessdate=2015-08-23}}</ref> The detective drama television show ''[[Veronica Mars]]'', which like the film includes the theme of class issues, featured an episode, \"[[One Angry Veronica]]\", in which the title character is selected for jury duty. The episode flips the film's format and depicts one holdout convincing the jury to ''convict'' the privileged defendants of assault against a less well-off victim, despite their lawyers initially convincing 11 jury members of a not guilty verdict.\n\nIn 1997, a television remake of the film [[12 Angry Men (1997 film)|under the same title]] was directed by [[William Friedkin]] and produced by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]. In the newer version, the judge is a woman and four of the jurors are black, but the overall plot remains intact. Modernizations include not smoking in the jury room, changes in references to pop culture figures and income, references to execution by lethal injection as opposed to the electric chair, more race-related dialogue and profanity.\n\nThe film has also been subject to parody. In 2015, the [[Comedy Central]] TV series ''[[Inside Amy Schumer]]'' aired a half-hour parody of the film titled \"12 Angry Men Inside Amy Schumer\".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.vulture.com/2015/05/amy-schumer-12-angry-men-pictures.html |title= Behold Inside Amy Schumer's Dead-On ''12 Angry Men''\n |last = Lyons | first = Margaret |work=[[New York (magazine)#Digital expansion and blogs|Vulture]] |accessdate=May 6, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/monkeysee/2015/05/06/404649955/amy-schumer-puts-her-own-looks-on-trial |title= Amy Schumer Puts Her Own Looks On Trial\n |last = Homes | first = Linda |work=[[NPR]] |accessdate=May 6, 2015}}</ref> BBC Radio comedy ''[[Hancock's Half Hour]]'', starring [[Tony Hancock]] and [[Sid James]], and written by Ray Galton and Alan Simpson, broadcast a half-hour parody on October 16, 1959, also known as ''[[Twelve Angry Men (Hancock's Half Hour)|Twelve Angry Men]]''.

''[[Family Guy]]'' paid tribute to the film with its Season 11 episode titled \"[[12 and a Half Angry Men]]\", and ''[[King of The Hill]]'' acknowledged the film with their parody \"Nine Pretty Darn Angry Men\" in season 3. Sitcom ''Happy Days'' also features a similar story in the season 5 episode \"Fonzie for the Defense\", when Howard Cunningham and Fonzie are picked for a jury, and Fonzie is the lone hold-out for innocence, swaying the rest of the jury.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0596193/|title=\"Happy Days\" Fonzie for the Defense (TV Episode 1978)|work=IMDb}}</ref> ''Saturday Night Live'' parodied the film in 1984 in a sketch called First Draft Theater.

It originally aired on [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] in the United States on November 27, 2011. In the episode, Glenn ([[Steven Yeun]]) reveals to the group that there are walkers in the Greenes' barn, dividing the group on what to do. Hershel Greene ([[Scott Wilson (actor)|Scott Wilson]]) sets a deadline for the group to leave, unless [[Rick Grimes]] ([[Andrew Lincoln]]) does a difficult task. Meanwhile, [[Shane Walsh (The Walking Dead)|Shane Walsh]] ([[Jon Bernthal]]) slowly loses his sanity after many secrets around him are revealed and [[Carol Peletier]] begins to question whether her daughter, [[Sophia Peletier|Sophia]] will be found.\n\nThe episode was written by [[Scott M. Gimple]] and directed by [[Michelle MacLaren]]. The death of Sophia Peletier is a prominent theme in \"Pretty Much Dead Already\"; she was killed by Grimes following her conversion into a walker. [[Robert Kirkman]] felt that killing Sophia off would add more dimension to the show, and create more flexibility in regards to the progression of the storylines, as well as leading to very different storylines from the [[The Walking Dead (comic book)|comic series]], with Carol outliving her daughter, as opposed to the other way around. \"Pretty Much Dead Already\" generated acclaim from critics, who praised the episode's conclusion and the development of the characters. Upon airing in the United States, the episode attained 6.62 million viewers and a 3.5 rating in the 18-49 demographic, according to [[Nielsen ratings]]. It became the highest-rated cable telecast of the day, as well as the fourth most-viewed cable program of the week.\n\n==Plot==\nGlenn ([[Steven Yeun]]), at the urging of Dale ([[Jeffrey DeMunn]]), finally tells the group that the Greene family's barn is full of [[zombie|walkers]]. The group inspects the barn, and Shane ([[Jon Bernthal]]) believes they should clear the barn, but [[Rick Grimes|Rick]] ([[Andrew Lincoln]]) believes they need to get Hershel ([[Scott Wilson (actor)|Scott Wilson]])'s blessing since they are still guests on his property. Shane criticizes Rick for continuing the seemingly pointless search for Carol ([[Melissa McBride]])'s daughter Sophia, infuriating Daryl ([[Norman Reedus]]).\n\nLater, Maggie Greene ([[Lauren Cohan]]) confronts Glenn about revealing the barn's secret to the group, but Glenn says his personal well-being is more important than her affections. Carol tries to stop Daryl from searching for Sophia alone, but he later comes back to show her another [[Rosa laevigata|Cherokee rose]] blooming, helping to restore Carol's faith they will find Sophia. Elsewhere, Rick confronts Shane about his defiant attitude. The two argue until Rick exclaims that Lori ([[Sarah Wayne Callies]]) is pregnant. As Rick leaves, Shane congratulates him, but is shocked and scared by this revelation.\n\nRick approaches Hershel about the walkers in the barn, but Hershel refuses to allow them to harm the walkers. He, Maggie, and [[Jimmy (The Walking Dead)|Jimmy]] (James Allen McCune) bring Rick to a forest swamp where two walkers are stuck. Hershel insists that if Rick's group is to stay on his farm, they must treat the walkers as people, and shows Rick how to snare and lead the walkers back.\n\nMeanwhile, Shane confronts Lori about her pregnancy, believing himself to be the father. Lori denies this, and Shane storms off, but Carl ([[Chandler Riggs]]) stops him, insisting that they stay and search for Sophia. Dale ([[Jeffrey DeMunn]]), witnessing this, warns Andrea ([[Laurie Holden]]) about Shane's erratic behavior, and then distracts the others long enough to take the weapons from the camp and to hide them in the swamp. Shane discovers the missing weapons and tracks down Dale, demanding he return them. Dale gives in to Shane, but warns him about losing his humanity. Shane replies that they are \"pretty much dead already\".\n\nShane arms the rest of the group and they converge on the barn just as Hershel, Rick, and the others return with the snared walkers. Shane screams that walkers are not people and shoots one of the captive walkers before breaking the locks off the barn doors. Walkers start to file out, and Shane, Andrea, T-Dog ([[IronE Singleton]]), Daryl, and Glenn execute the zombies while the others watch. At the last moment, Sophia ([[Madison Lintz]]) emerges from the barn, dead and zombified. The group is paralyzed with shock and sadness, unable to act as Sophia walks towards them. Only Rick is able to step forward and shoot her.\n\n==Production==\n[[File: Madison Lintz 2014.jpg | thumb | left | 195px | This episode marks the departure of [[Sophia Peletier]], portrayed by [[Madison Lintz]].]]\n{{Quote box |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=center |width=30% |align=right | quote = Oh yeah, that was her in makeup.

After the group has shot the walkers housed in Hershel Greene's barn, Sophia appears from the barn as a walker, much to the groups' dismay. A disturbed and distraught Rick Grimes pulls out his weapon and makes the decision to shoot her. Despite being initially surprised about her character's being killed off, Madison Lintz concluded that she understood its aftermath for the show.<ref name=amc>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.amctv.com/the-walking-dead/2012/01/madison-lintz-interview.php|title=Q&A - Madison Lintz (Sophia)|last=Rosenburg|first=Eli|publisher=[[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]]|date=January 2, 2012|accessdate=January 9, 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120107201903/http://blogs.amctv.com/the-walking-dead/2012/01/madison-lintz-interview.php|archivedate=January 7, 2012}}</ref> Lintz affirmed that portraying a walker was a welcoming experience for her, and stated that she was \"going to look back on and say that was amazing.\"<ref name=amc/> Robert Kirkman felt that killing Sophia would add more dimension to the show, as well as add more flexibility to its storyline progression. \"When a good idea comes up, you have to go with it,\" he articulated.<ref name=hr/> \"Sophia is a character who is still alive in the comic book series and who has contributed quite a bit to the overall narrative and informed a lot of story lines for a lot of different characters.

That's a big concern when you have this kind of story line and you are leading to that kind of reveal. You don't want people to be expecting it, especially in the ''Walking Dead''. I pride myself in the fact that, when you pick up an issue of the comic, you don't know what's going to happen at any time.

After getting into a heated argument, Rick reveals to Shane about her pregnancy. Although he didn't question who the biological father was, Robert Kirkman felt that Rick was \"smart enough to know that the kid's either his or Shane's and there may not be any way of ever finding out that definitively.\"<ref name=ent2/> He continued: \"Bringing that up to his wife, who he loves, is only going to be painful for her.

It originally aired on [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] in the United States on November 27, 2011. In the episode, Glenn ([[Steven Yeun]]) reveals to the group that there are walkers in the Greenes' barn, dividing the group on what to do. Hershel Greene ([[Scott Wilson (actor)|Scott Wilson]]) sets a deadline for the group to leave, unless [[Rick Grimes]] ([[Andrew Lincoln]]) does a difficult task. Meanwhile, [[Shane Walsh (The Walking Dead)|Shane Walsh]] ([[Jon Bernthal]]) slowly loses his sanity after many secrets around him are revealed and [[Carol Peletier]] begins to question whether her daughter, [[Sophia Peletier|Sophia]] will be found.\n\nThe episode was written by [[Scott M. Gimple]] and directed by [[Michelle MacLaren]]. The death of Sophia Peletier is a prominent theme in \"Pretty Much Dead Already\"; she was killed by Grimes following her conversion into a walker. [[Robert Kirkman]] felt that killing Sophia off would add more dimension to the show, and create more flexibility in regards to the progression of the storylines, as well as leading to very different storylines from the [[The Walking Dead (comic book)|comic series]], with Carol outliving her daughter, as opposed to the other way around. \"Pretty Much Dead Already\" generated critical acclaim, who praised the episode's conclusion and the development of the characters. Upon airing in the United States, the episode attained 6.62 million viewers and a 3.5 rating in the 18-49 demographic, according to [[Nielsen ratings]]. It became the highest-rated cable telecast of the day, as well as the fourth most-viewed cable program of the week.\n\n==Plot==\nGlenn ([[Steven Yeun]]), at the urging of Dale ([[Jeffrey DeMunn]]), finally tells the group that the Greene family's barn is full of [[zombie|walkers]]. The group inspects the barn, and Shane ([[Jon Bernthal]]) believes they should clear the barn, but [[Rick Grimes|Rick]] ([[Andrew Lincoln]]) believes they need to get Hershel ([[Scott Wilson (actor)|Scott Wilson]])'s blessing since they are still guests on his property. Shane criticizes Rick for continuing the seemingly pointless search for Carol ([[Melissa McBride]])'s daughter Sophia, infuriating Daryl ([[Norman Reedus]]).\n\nLater, Maggie Greene ([[Lauren Cohan]]) confronts Glenn about revealing the barn's secret to the group, but Glenn says his personal well-being is more important than her affections. Carol tries to stop Daryl from searching for Sophia alone, but he later comes back to show her another [[Rosa laevigata|Cherokee rose]] blooming, helping to restore Carol's faith they will find Sophia. Elsewhere, Rick confronts Shane about his defiant attitude. The two argue until Rick exclaims that Lori ([[Sarah Wayne Callies]]) is pregnant. As Rick leaves, Shane congratulates him, but is shocked and scared by this revelation.\n\nRick approaches Hershel about the walkers in the barn, but Hershel refuses to allow them to harm the walkers. He, Maggie, and [[Jimmy (The Walking Dead)|Jimmy]] (James Allen McCune) bring Rick to a forest swamp where two walkers are stuck. Hershel insists that if Rick's group is to stay on his farm, they must treat the walkers as people, and shows Rick how to snare and lead the walkers back.\n\nMeanwhile, Shane confronts Lori about her pregnancy, believing himself to be the father. Lori denies this, and Shane storms off, but Carl ([[Chandler Riggs]]) stops him, insisting that they stay and search for Sophia. Dale ([[Jeffrey DeMunn]]), witnessing this, warns Andrea ([[Laurie Holden]]) about Shane's erratic behavior, and then distracts the others long enough to take the weapons from the camp and to hide them in the swamp. Shane discovers the missing weapons and tracks down Dale, demanding he return them. Dale gives in to Shane, but warns him about losing his humanity. Shane replies that they are \"pretty much dead already\".\n\nShane arms the rest of the group and they converge on the barn just as Hershel, Rick, and the others return with the snared walkers. Shane screams that walkers are not people and shoots one of the captive walkers before breaking the locks off the barn doors. Walkers start to file out, and Shane, Andrea, T-Dog ([[IronE Singleton]]), Daryl, and Glenn execute the zombies while the others watch. At the last moment, Sophia ([[Madison Lintz]]) emerges from the barn, dead and zombified. The group is paralyzed with shock and sadness, unable to act as Sophia walks towards them. Only Rick is able to step forward and shoot her.\n\n==Production==\n[[File: Madison Lintz 2014.jpg | thumb | left | 195px | This episode marks the departure of [[Sophia Peletier]], portrayed by [[Madison Lintz]].]]\n{{Quote box |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=center |width=30% |align=right | quote = Oh yeah, that was her in makeup.

That's a big concern when you have this kind of story line and you are leading to that kind of reveal. You don't want people to be expecting it, especially in the ''Walking Dead''.

After getting into a heated argument, Rick reveals to Shane about her pregnancy. Although he didn't question who the biological father was, Robert Kirkman felt that Rick was \"smart enough to know that the kid's either his or Shane's and there may not be any way of ever finding out that definitively.\"<ref name=ent2/> He continued: \"Bringing that up to his wife, who he loves, is only going to be painful for her.

Monsoon rewarded Wippleman for his efforts by making him an official referee. One of Wippleman's last appearances as a regular WWF referee during this time came on the March 10, 1997 episode of ''Raw'' when [[Joanie Laurer|Chyna]] [[Gorilla press slam|gorilla press]]ed him into a group of referees.\nOn the May 19, 1997 episode  of ''Raw'' Wippleman appeared in a backstage segment with [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]] telling Wippleman that he was going to be his tag team partner with Wippleman responding that he was scared. Wippleman also appeared as \"Handsome Harvey,\" introducing D-Generation-X on ''Raw'' on November 24, 1997. This was to make fun of [[Rick Rude]]. Rude had been a member of DX and had just left the company a week earlier to go to WCW. This resulted in Rude being on both ''Raw'' and ''WCW Monday Nitro'' on the same night. (At the time, ''Raw'' was taped every other week while ''Nitro'' was live every week).\n\nIn June 1999, after another period of absence from television broadcasts, Wippleman resurfaced on the June 13 episode of ''Sunday Night Heat'' as a referee in a match between then-Intercontinental Champion [[Jeff Jarrett]] and [[Test (wrestler)|Test]].  Test won the match after outside interference, thus being named the new champion, but he was persuaded by Jarrett's valet [[Debra Marshall|Debra]] to overturn the result and return the belt.  He also served as a [[Strikebreaker|scab]] official during the WWF referee strike in September 1999, including at the [[Unforgiven (1999)|Unforgiven]] PPV, again refereeing a match with Jarrett defending the Intercontinental title against Chyna.\n\nOn January 31, 2000, Wippleman won the WWF Women's Championship from [[Stacy Carter|The Kat]] while he was in a disguise and used the name \"Hervina\" in a \"Lumberjill Snow Bunny\" match, which took place in a snow-filled pool surrounded by female wrestlers who kept the competitors from leaving the pool.<ref name=encyclopedia/><ref name=women>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/women/304454132121112213|title=Women's Title History: Hervina|publisher=[[World Wrestling Entertainment]]|accessdate=2009-05-06}}</ref> The win made him the first male to hold the Women's Championship.<ref name=women/> He lost the title the following day (but broadcast on February 3) to Jacqueline in a match that lasted under a minute,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/women/30445413212111216|title=Women's Title History: Jacqueline|publisher=[[World Wrestling Entertainment]]|accessdate=2009-05-06}}</ref> thus ending the shortest reign in the title's history.  Through the remainder of 2000, Wippleman appeared in backstage and non-match segments of the WWF's television programming, including a segment on the April 23, 2000 episode of ''Sunday Night Heat'' where he appeared dressed up as a rabbit as part of a segment with [[Al Snow]] and [[Steve Blackman]].\n\nAt [[WrestleMania X-Seven]] on April 1, 2001, Wippleman managed Kamala during the gimmick battle royal.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INFC7xG77mI|title=Gimmick Battle Royal - WrestleMania X-Seven\n| publisher = YouTube |accessdate=January 17, 2014}}</ref>\n\nAt the point the [[The Invasion (professional wrestling)|Invasion storyline]] began in 2001, he had disappeared from WWF programming, and was then working as a [[List of professional wrestling terms#A|road agent]] for the company.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://morningjournal.com/articles/2008/07/27/sports/19871326.txt|title=Off the Turnbuckle: Raw-ECW merger plans have been scrapped|last=Gilles|first=Dan|newspaper=The Morning Journal|accessdate=2009-05-06|date=2008-07-27|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120218151953/http://morningjournal.com/articles/2008/07/27/sports/19871326.txt|archivedate=2012-02-18}}</ref>\n\nOn November 15, 2010, for WWE's old school episode of ''Raw'', Wippleman returned to WWE, managing the [[Brooklyn Brawler]] in a squash loss to Ezekiel Jackson.\n\nAs of 2011, Lauer was working with the WWE in backstage roles at television and pay-per-view events.

Wippleman would begin carrying a doctor's bag to the ring containing medical equipment.  After Sid's matches against jobbers, Wippleman would retrieve a stethoscope from his bag and listen to the defeated wrestler's hearts.\n\nAfter Sid left the company, Wippleman managed [[Kamala (wrestler)|Kamala]], who was [[feud (professional wrestling)|feuding]] with [[The Undertaker]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Kamala's bio|accessdate=2008-09-16|publisher=[[World Wrestling Entertainment]]|url=http://www.wwe.com/superstars/wwealumni/kamala/bio/}}</ref> After Kamala was defeated by Undertaker in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Container-based variations|Coffin match]] at [[Survivor Series (1992)|Survivor Series]] in 1992, Kamala left Wippleman and [[Slick (wrestling)|Reverend Slick]] became his new manager.<ref>{{cite web|title=Kamala Matata|publisher=[[World Wrestling Entertainment]]|date=2007-05-28|first=Mike|last=McAvennie|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/listthis/wildestsuperstars/wildestsuperstars3|accessdate=2008-09-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=From Season to Season: Sports as American Religion|author=Price, Joseph L.|publisher=Mercer University Press|year=2005|isbn=0-86554-961-3|page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_2900865549615/page/209 209]|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_2900865549615/page/209}}</ref> Afterwards, Wippleman dropped the Dr. gimmick. He continued to feud with the Undertaker and brought a new wrestler to the WWF, the nearly eight-foot-tall [[Jorge Gonz\u00e1lez (wrestler)|Giant Gonz\u00e1lez]]. The feud culminated in a [[No Disqualification match|Rest in Peace match]] at [[SummerSlam (1993)|SummerSlam]], which Undertaker won.<ref name=wwequizbook-pp85>{{cite book|last=Feigenbaum|first=Aaron|author2=Kevin Kelly |author3=Seth Mates |author4=Brian Solomon |author5=Phil Speer |title=The Ultimate World Wrestling Entertainment Trivia Book|page=85|isbn=0-7434-5756-0}}</ref>  During this period, Wippleman also briefly managed Mr. Hughes, who left the WWF after a few months. Wippleman was also the manager of [[Bryan Clark|Adam Bomb]] from October 1993 until June 1994, when Bomb turned face, and feuded with [[Savio Vega|Kwang]], who was also being managed by Wippleman. Wippleman also managed [[Well Dunn]], who faced the [[The Rock 'n' Roll Express|Rock 'n' Roll Express]] in the RnR's WWF debut on October 10, 1993.<ref>{{Citation|last=Top Turnbuckle|title=Rock N' Roll Express vs. Well Dunn (10-10-1993)|date=2015-03-28|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxmFAnu4MI0|accessdate=2018-01-06}}</ref>\n\nSince debuting in the WWF, Wippleman was always at odds with ring announcer [[Howard Finkel]], whom Wippleman believed introduced him in a condescending manner. At [[WrestleMania X]], Wippleman tore up Finkel's tuxedo, and Finkel shoved him to the mat. The feud culminated in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Tuxedo match|tuxedo match]] on the January 9, 1995 edition of ''[[WWE Raw|Monday Night RAW]]'', which Finkel won.<ref name=legacy>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/subscriptions/legacy/19901995/|title=Matches from the early 1990s|accessdate=2009-05-07|publisher=[[World Wrestling Entertainment]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090305224033/http://www.wwe.com/subscriptions/legacy/19901995/|archivedate=March 5, 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nWippleman's next high-profile storyline was later in 1995, when he managed his on-screen girlfriend [[Rhonda Sing|Bertha Faye]].<ref name=encyclopedia/><ref name=list>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/listthis/greatestwhoamances/greatwhoamances9|title=List This #9: Harvey's whipped|author=McAvennie, Mike|publisher=[[World Wrestling Entertainment]]|accessdate=2008-09-23|date=February 15, 2007}}</ref> Faye, with Wippleman in her corner, won the [[WWE Women's Championship (1956\u20132010)|WWF Women's Championship]] by defeating [[Debrah Miceli|Alundra Blayze]] at [[SummerSlam (1995)|SummerSlam 1995]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/women/304454132121112115|title=Bertha Faye's reign|publisher=[[World Wrestling Entertainment]]|accessdate=2008-08-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=Pro Wrestling Illustrated: 2008 Wrestling Almanac & Book of Facts|publisher=Sports & Entertainment Publications, LLC|issn=1043-7576|volume=29|issue=5|page=123}}</ref> After losing the WWF Women's Championship in late 1995, Faye was dropped from the WWF roster and Wippleman disappeared from television.

Monsoon rewarded Wippleman for his efforts by making him an official referee. One of Wippleman's last appearances as a regular WWF referee during this time came on the March 10, 1997 episode of ''Raw'' when [[Joanie Laurer|Chyna]] [[Gorilla press slam|gorilla press]]ed him into a group of referees.\nOn the May 19, 1997 episode  of ''Raw'' Wippleman appeared in a backstage segment with [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]] telling Wippleman that he was going to be his tag team partner with Wippleman responding that he was scared. Wippleman also appeared as \"Handsome Harvey,\" introducing D-Generation-X on ''Raw'' on November 24, 1997. This was to make fun of [[Rick Rude]]. Rude had been a member of DX and had just left the company a week earlier to go to WCW. This resulted in Rude being on both ''Raw'' and ''WCW Monday Nitro'' on the same night. (At the time, ''Raw'' was taped every other week while ''Nitro'' was live every week).\n\nIn June 1999, after another period of absence from television broadcasts, Wippleman resurfaced on the June 13 episode of ''Sunday Night Heat'' as a referee in a match between then-Intercontinental Champion [[Jeff Jarrett]] and [[Test (wrestler)|Test]].  Test won the match after outside interference, thus being named the new champion, but he was persuaded by Jarrett's valet [[Debra Marshall|Debra]] to overturn the result and return the belt.  He also served as a [[Strikebreaker|scab]] official during the WWF referee strike in September 1999, including at the [[Unforgiven (1999)|Unforgiven]] PPV, again refereeing a match with Jarrett defending the Intercontinental title against Chyna.\n\nOn January 31, 2000, Wippleman won the WWF Women's Championship from [[Stacy Carter|The Kat]] while he was in a disguise and used the name \"Hervina\" in a \"Lumberjill Snow Bunny\" match, which took place in a snow-filled pool surrounded by female wrestlers who kept the competitors from leaving the pool.<ref name=encyclopedia/><ref name=women>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/women/304454132121112213|title=Women's Title History: Hervina|publisher=[[World Wrestling Entertainment]]|accessdate=2009-05-06}}</ref> The win made him the first male to hold the Women's Championship.<ref name=women/> He lost the title the following day (but broadcast on February 3) to Jacqueline in a match that lasted under a minute,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/women/30445413212111216|title=Women's Title History: Jacqueline|publisher=[[World Wrestling Entertainment]]|accessdate=2009-05-06}}</ref> thus ending the shortest reign in the title's history.  Through the remainder of 2000, Wippleman appeared in backstage and non-match segments of the WWF's television programming, including a segment on the April 23, 2000 episode of ''Sunday Night Heat'' where he appeared dressed up as a rabbit as part of a segment with [[Al Snow]] and [[Steve Blackman]].\n\nAt [[WrestleMania X-Seven]] on April 1, 2001, Wippleman managed Kamala during the gimmick battle royal.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INFC7xG77mI|title=Gimmick Battle Royal - WrestleMania X-Seven\n| publisher = YouTube |accessdate=January 17, 2014}}</ref>\n\nAt the point the [[The Invasion (professional wrestling)|Invasion storyline]] began in 2001, he had disappeared from WWF programming, and was then working as a [[List of professional wrestling terms#A|road agent]] for the company.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://morningjournal.com/articles/2008/07/27/sports/19871326.txt|title=Off the Turnbuckle: Raw-ECW merger plans have been scrapped|last=Gilles|first=Dan|newspaper=The Morning Journal|accessdate=2009-05-06|date=2008-07-27|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120218151953/http://morningjournal.com/articles/2008/07/27/sports/19871326.txt|archivedate=2012-02-18}}</ref>\n\nOn November 15, 2010, for WWE's old school episode of ''Raw'', Wippleman returned to WWE, managing the [[Brooklyn Brawler]] in a squash loss to Ezekiel Jackson.\n\nAs of 2011, Lauer was working with the WWE in backstage roles at television and pay-per-view events.  In an interview with [[Jim Korderas]], Lauer described his role as \"concierge\", taking care of details such as food, rental cars and the like.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://radio.thescore.com/episodes/harvey-whippleman-nov-10-2011|title=Harvey Whippleman - Nov 10, 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20111114140835/http://radio.thescore.com/episodes/harvey-whippleman-nov-10-2011|archivedate=2011-11-14}}</ref>\n\nOn January 22, 2018, Harvey made a brief backstage appearance during [[Raw 25 Years]].\n\n==Personal life==\nLauer grew up in [[Penn Hills, Pennsylvania]], near [[Pittsburgh]].<ref name=rmn/> According to Lauer, he spent his teenage years \"sprawling on car hoods, smoking cigarettes, and drinking beer with no particular ambition in mind\".<ref name=slam/> His drinking eventually caused Lauer to serve jail time in Memphis.<ref name=slam/>\n\nIn 1994, Lauer was in a car accident with [[Joey Marella]], which claimed Marella's life and injured Lauer.<ref name=slam/> The crash occurred as a result of Marella falling asleep at the wheel while driving on the way to [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]].<ref name=moon/> Marella was not wearing his seat belt, but Lauer\u2013the passenger\u2013was wearing his.<ref name=moon>{{cite web|url=http://www.mikemooneyham.com/pages/viewfull.cfm?ObjectID=B9F6BD0A-2627-4FE4-B3801B91D574CE58|title=Crash Claims Joey Marella|author=Mooneyham, Mike|publisher=The Wrestling Gospel|date=1994-07-10|accessdate=2009-05-07|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081113123415/http://www.mikemooneyham.com/pages/viewfull.cfm?ObjectID=B9F6BD0A-2627-4FE4-B3801B91D574CE58|archivedate=November 13, 2008}}</ref> Because of the severity of his injuries, however, Lauer incurred approximately $10,000 in medical expenses.<ref name=slam/> He wrote an autobiography ''Wrestling with the Truth'', which was released in 2008.<ref name=slam>{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/Reviews/2008/08/13/6436746.html|title=Lauer's book a good glimpse at a day gone by|author=Johnson, Steven|date=August 19, 2008|accessdate=2009-05-07}}</ref><ref name=rmn/> Lauer is [[Roman Catholic]].\n\n==Championships and accomplishments==\n'''[[Continental Championship Wrestling|Continental Wrestling Federation]]'''\n*[[NWA Southeastern United States Junior Heavyweight Championship|Southeast United States Junior Heavyweight Championship]] (1 time)<ref name=\"Titles\"/>\n\n'''[[World Wrestling Entertainment|World Wrestling Federation]]'''\n*[[WWE Women's Championship (1956\u20132010)|WWF Women's Championship]] ([[List of WWE Women's Champions|1 time]])<ref name=women/>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category}}\n* {{Professional wrestling profiles}}\n{{WWE Women's Championship}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Wippleman, Harvey}}\n[[Category:1965 births]]\n[[Category:American male professional wrestlers]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:People from Pennsylvania]]\n[[Category:People from Walls, Mississippi]]\n[[Category:Professional wrestling managers and valets]]\n[[Category:WWF/WWE Women's Champions]]\n", "name_user": "84.13.202.96", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvey_Wippleman"}
