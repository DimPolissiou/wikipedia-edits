Explosives equivalent to around 1,000&nbsp;kilograms (2,200 pounds) of [[trinitrotoluene|TNT]] were [[detonate]]d as his [[motorcade]] drove near the St. George Hotel. Among the dead were several of Hariri's [[bodyguard]]s and former Minister of the Economy, [[Bassel Fleihan]].\n\nHariri had been part of the anti-Syrian opposition in Lebanon. His [[assassination]] triggered the [[Cedar Revolution]], a popular movement which forced Syria to withdraw all its troops in Lebanon by April 2005.<ref>Rudy Jaafar and Maria J.

He added that Lahoud should be viewed as his personal representative in Lebanon and that \"opposing him is tantamount to opposing Assad himself\".

The Special Tribunal for Lebanon was also created at his instigation.\n\nFollowing Hariri's death, there were several other [[2005 Lebanon bombings|bombings and assassinations]] against anti-Syrian figures. These included [[Samir Kassir]], [[George Hawi]], [[Gebran Tueni]], [[Pierre Amine Gemayel]], and [[Walid Eido]].

He added that Lahoud should be viewed as his personal representative in Lebanon and that \"opposing him is tantamount to opposing Assad himself\".

During a ''partial solar eclipse'' (right), the Moon blocks only part of the Sun's disk ([[Solar eclipse of October 23, 2014|October 23, 2014]]).\n|}\n\nA '''solar eclipse''' occurs when a portion of the [[Earth]] is engulfed in a shadow cast by the [[Moon]] which fully or partially blocks sunlight.  This occurs when the [[Sun]], [[Moon]] and [[Earth]] are aligned. Such alignment coincides with a new moon ([[Syzygy (astronomy)|syzygy]]) indicating the Moon is closest to the [[Ecliptic|ecliptic plane]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Science/What_is_an_eclipse|title=What is an eclipse?|work=European Space Agency|access-date=2018-08-04}}</ref>  In a total [[eclipse]], the disk of the Sun is fully obscured by the Moon. In [[#Types|partial and annular eclipses]], only part of the Sun is obscured.\n\nIf the Moon were in a perfectly circular orbit, a little closer to the Earth, and in the same [[ecliptic|orbital plane]], there would be total solar eclipses every new moon. However, since the Moon's orbit is [[inclination|tilted]] at more than 5 degrees to the [[Ecliptic|Earth's orbit around the Sun]], its shadow usually misses Earth.  A solar eclipse can only occur when the Moon is close enough to the [[Ecliptic|ecliptic plane]] during a [[new moon]].  Special conditions must occur for the two events to coincide because the Moon's orbit crosses the ecliptic at its [[orbital node]]s twice every [[draconic month]] (27.212220 days) while a new moon occurs one every [[synodic month]] (29.530587981 days).  Solar (and lunar) eclipses therefore happen only during [[eclipse season]]s resulting in at least two, and up to five, solar eclipses each year; no more than two of which can be total eclipses.<ref name=\"totality\">{{Cite book|title=Totality: Eclipses of the Sun|last=Littmann|first=Mark|last2=Espenak|first2=Fred|last3=Willcox|first3=Ken|date=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-953209-4|pages=18\u201319}}</ref><ref>Five solar eclipses occurred in 1935.{{Cite book|url=http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/eclipse.html|title=NASA Eclipse Web Site|author=NASA|date=September 6, 2009|others=[[Fred Espenak]], Project and Website Manager|chapter=Five Millennium Catalog of Solar Eclipses|accessdate=January 26, 2010|chapterurl=http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/SEcat5/SE1901-2000.html|author-link=NASA}}</ref>\n\nTotal eclipses are rare because the timing of the [[new moon]] within the [[eclipse season]] needs to be more exact for an alignment between the observer (on Earth) and the centers of the [[Sun]] and [[Moon]]. In addition, the elliptical orbit of the [[Moon]] often takes it far enough away from [[Earth]] that its [[apparent size]] is not large enough to block the [[Sun]] entirely.  Total solar eclipses are rare at any particular location because totality exists only along a narrow path on the Earth's surface traced by the Moon's full shadow or [[umbra]].\n\nAn eclipse is a [[List of natural phenomena|natural phenomenon]]. However, in some ancient and modern cultures, solar eclipses were attributed to [[supernatural]] causes or regarded as bad [[omen]]s. A total solar eclipse can be frightening to people who are unaware of its [[astronomy|astronomical]] explanation, as the Sun seems to disappear during the day and the sky darkens in a matter of minutes.\n\nSince [[sungazing|looking directly at the Sun]] can lead to permanent eye damage or blindness, special eye protection or indirect viewing techniques are used when viewing a solar eclipse. It is safe to view only the total phase of a total solar eclipse with the unaided eye and without protection; however worthwhile, this  practice must be undertaken carefully, though the extreme fading of the solar brightness by a factor of over 100 times in the last minute before totality makes it obvious when totality has begun and it is for that extreme variation and the view of the solar corona that leads people to travel to the zone of totality (the partial phases span over two hours while the total phase can only last a maximum of 7.5 minutes for any one location and is usually less). People referred to as ''[[eclipse chasers]]'' or ''umbraphiles'' will travel even to remote locations to observe or witness predicted central solar eclipses.<ref>{{cite news|last=Koukkos|first=Christina|title=Eclipse Chasing, in Pursuit of Total Awe|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/17/travel/17journeys.html|work=The New York Times|date=May 14, 2009|accessdate=January 15, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/11/opinion/11pasachoff.html|title=Why I Never Miss a Solar Eclipse|last=Pasachoff|first=Jay M.|work=The New York Times|date=July 10, 2010|accessdate=January 15, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Types== \n[[File:Solar Eclipse May 20,2012.jpg|thumb|Partial and annular phases of solar eclipse on May 20, 2012]]\nThere are four types of solar eclipses:\n* A '''total eclipse''' occurs when the dark silhouette of the Moon completely obscures the intensely bright light of the Sun, allowing the much fainter [[solar corona]] to be visible. During any one eclipse, totality occurs at best only in a narrow track on the surface of Earth.<ref>Harrington, pp. 7\u20138</ref> This narrow track is called the path of totality.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://eclipse2017.nasa.gov/eclipse-who-what-where-when-and-how|title=Eclipse: Who?

Hence the Sun appears as a very bright ring, or [[annulus (mathematics)|annulus]], surrounding the dark disk of the Moon.<ref name=\"Harrington10\">Harrington, pp. 9\u201311</ref>\n* A '''hybrid eclipse''' (also called '''annular/total eclipse''') shifts between a total and annular eclipse. At certain points on the surface of Earth, it appears as a total eclipse, whereas at other points it appears as annular. Hybrid eclipses are comparatively rare.<ref name=\"Harrington10\"/>\n* A '''partial eclipse''' occurs when the Sun and Moon are not exactly in line with the Earth and the Moon only partially obscures the Sun. This phenomenon can usually be seen from a large part of the Earth outside of the track of an annular or total eclipse. However, some eclipses can only be seen as a partial eclipse, because the [[umbra]] passes above the Earth's polar regions and never intersects the Earth's surface.<ref name=\"Harrington10\"/> Partial eclipses are virtually unnoticeable in terms of the Sun's brightness, as it takes well over 90% coverage to notice any darkening at all. Even at 99%, it would be no darker than [[civil twilight]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Transit of Venus, Sun\u2013Earth Day 2012|website=nasa.gov|url=http://sunearthday.nasa.gov/2012/facts.php|accessdate=February 7, 2016}}</ref> Of course, partial eclipses (and partial stages of other eclipses) can be observed if one is viewing the Sun through a darkening filter (which should always be used for safety).\n\n[[File:Comparison angular diameter.svg|thumb|Comparison of minimum and maximum apparent sizes of the Sun and Moon (and planets). An annular eclipse can occur when the Sun has a larger apparent size than the Moon, whereas a total eclipse can occur when the Moon has a larger apparent size.]]\nThe Sun's distance from Earth is about 400 times the Moon's distance, and the Sun's [[diameter]] is about 400 times the Moon's diameter. Because these ratios are approximately the same, the Sun and the Moon as seen from Earth appear to be approximately the same size: about 0.5 [[degree of arc]] in angular measure.<ref name=\"Harrington10\"/>\n\nA separate category of solar eclipses is that of the Sun being occluded by a body other than the Earth's Moon, as can be observed at points in space away from the Earth's surface. Two examples are when the crew of [[Apollo 12]] observed the [[:File:Earth Eclipses Sun-ap12-s80-37406.jpg|Earth eclipse the Sun]] in 1969 and when the ''[[Cassini\u2013Huygens|Cassini]]'' [[Space probe|probe]] observed [[:File:Saturn eclipse.jpg|Saturn eclipsing the Sun]] in 2006.\n\nThe Moon's orbit around the Earth is slightly [[ellipse|elliptical]], as is the Earth's orbit around the Sun. The apparent sizes of the Sun and Moon therefore vary.<ref>{{cite web|title=Solar Eclipses |website=University of Tennessee |url=http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/astr161/lect/time/eclipses.html|accessdate=January 15, 2012}}</ref> The [[magnitude of an eclipse]] is the ratio of the apparent size of the Moon to the apparent size of the Sun during an eclipse. An eclipse that occurs when the Moon is near its closest distance to Earth (''i.e.,'' near its [[perigee]]) can be a total eclipse because the Moon will appear to be large enough to completely cover the Sun's bright disk or [[photosphere]]; a total eclipse has a magnitude greater than or equal to 1.000. Conversely, an eclipse that occurs when the Moon is near its farthest distance from Earth (''i.e.,'' near its [[apogee]]) can only be an annular eclipse because the Moon will appear to be slightly smaller than the Sun; the magnitude of an annular eclipse is less than 1.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/total-solar-eclipse/en/|title=How Is the Sun Completely Blocked in an Eclipse?|publisher=[[NASA]]|work=NASA Space Place|date=2009}}</ref>\n\nA hybrid eclipse occurs when the magnitude of an eclipse changes during the event from less to greater than one, so the eclipse appears to be total at locations nearer the midpoint, and annular at other locations nearer the beginning and end, since the sides of the Earth are slightly further away from the Moon.  These eclipses are extremely narrow in their path width and relatively short in their duration at any point compared with fully total eclipses; the 2023 April 20 hybrid eclipse's totality is over a minute in duration at various points along the path of totality.  Like a [[focus (optics)|focal point]], the width and duration of totality and annularity are near zero at the points where the changes between the two occur.<ref>{{cite web|first=Fred|last=Espenak|date=September 26, 2009|title=Solar Eclipses for Beginners|url=http://www.mreclipse.com/Special/SEprimer.html|accessdate=January 15, 2012|website=MrEclipse.com}}</ref>\n\nBecause the Earth's orbit around the Sun is also elliptical, the Earth's distance from the Sun similarly varies throughout the year. This affects the apparent size of the Sun in the same way, but not as much as does the Moon's varying distance from Earth.<ref name=\"Harrington10\"/> When Earth approaches its [[Aphelion|farthest distance from the Sun]] in early July, a total eclipse is somewhat more likely, whereas conditions favour an annular eclipse when Earth approaches its [[perihelion|closest distance to the Sun]] in early January.<ref>Steel, p. 351</ref>\n\n===Terminology for central eclipse===\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| image1    = Solar eclipse visualisation.svg\n| width1    = 250\n| caption1  = Each icon shows the view from the centre of its black spot, representing the Moon (not to scale)\n| image2    = Exit Diamond Ring Effect.jpg\n| width2    = 200\n| caption2  = Diamond ring effect at third contact\u2014the end of totality\u2014with visible prominences\n}}\n''Central eclipse'' is often used as a generic term for a total, annular, or hybrid eclipse.<ref name=\"SEpath\">{{cite web|url=http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/SEpath/SEpath.html|title=Central Solar Eclipses: 1991\u20132050|first=Fred|last=Espenak|date=January 6, 2009|publisher=NASA Goddard Space Flight Center|work=NASA Eclipse web site|location=Greenbelt, MD|accessdate=January 15, 2012}}</ref> This is, however, not completely correct: the definition of a central eclipse is an eclipse during which the central line of the umbra touches the Earth's surface.

This is then called a non-central total or annular eclipse.<ref name=\"SEpath\"/> [[Gamma (eclipse)|Gamma]] is a measure of how centrally the shadow strikes.

The dark gray region between the Moon and Earth is the [[umbra]], where the Sun is completely obscured by the Moon. The small area where the umbra touches Earth's surface is where a total eclipse can be seen. The larger light gray area is the [[penumbra]], in which a partial eclipse can be seen. An observer in the [[Umbra#Antumbra|antumbra]], the area of shadow beyond the umbra, will see an annular eclipse.<ref>Mobberley, pp. 30\u201338</ref>\n\nThe [[Orbit of the Moon|Moon's orbit]] around the Earth is inclined at an angle of just over 5 degrees to the plane of the Earth's orbit around the Sun (the [[ecliptic]]). Because of this, at the time of a new moon, the Moon will usually pass to the north or south of the Sun. A solar eclipse can occur only when new moon occurs close to one of the points (known as [[Orbital node|nodes]]) where the Moon's orbit crosses the ecliptic.<ref name=\"Harrington\">Harrington, pp. 4\u20135</ref>\n\nAs noted above, the Moon's orbit is also [[ellipse|elliptical]]. The Moon's distance from the Earth can vary by about 6% from its average value. Therefore, the Moon's apparent size varies with its distance from the Earth, and it is this effect that leads to the difference between total and annular eclipses. The distance of the Earth from the Sun also varies during the year, but this is a smaller effect. On average, the Moon appears to be slightly smaller than the Sun as seen from the Earth, so the majority (about 60%) of central eclipses are annular. It is only when the Moon is closer to the Earth than average (near its [[perigee]]) that a total eclipse occurs.<ref>{{cite web|first=Ron|last=Hipschman|title=Why Eclipses Happen|website=Exploratorium|url=http://www.exploratorium.edu/eclipse/why.html|accessdate=January 14, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Brewer, Bryan|date=January 14, 1998|title=What Causes an Eclipse?|website=Earth View|url=http://www.earthview.com/tutorial/causes.htm|accessdate=January 14, 2012|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130102203300/http://www.earthview.com/tutorial/causes.htm|archivedate=January 2, 2013}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center; margin: 0.1em auto;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=2 width=120 | &nbsp;\n! colspan=2 width=320 | Moon\n! colspan=2 width=320 | Sun\n|-\n!

This is known as the [[sidereal month]]. However, during one sidereal month, Earth has revolved part way around the Sun, making the average time between one new moon and the next longer than the sidereal month: it is approximately 29.5 days. This is known as the [[synodic month]] and corresponds to what is commonly called the [[lunar month]].<ref name=\"Harrington\"/>\n\nThe Moon crosses from south to north of the ecliptic at its [[ascending node]], and vice versa at its descending node.<ref name=\"Harrington\"/> However, the nodes of the Moon's orbit are gradually moving in a [[retrograde motion]], due to the action of the Sun's gravity on the Moon's motion, and they make a complete circuit every 18.6 years. This regression means that the time between each passage of the Moon through the ascending node is slightly shorter than the sidereal month. This period is called the nodical or [[draconic month]].<ref>Steel, pp. 319\u2013321</ref>\n\nFinally, the Moon's perigee is moving forwards or precessing in its orbit and makes a complete circuit in 8.85 years. The time between one perigee and the next is slightly longer than the sidereal month and known as the [[anomalistic month]].<ref>Steel, pp. 317\u2013319</ref>\n\nThe Moon's orbit intersects with the ecliptic at the two nodes that are 180 degrees apart. Therefore, the new moon occurs close to the nodes at two periods of the year approximately six months (173.3 days) apart, known as [[eclipse season]]s, and there will always be at least one solar eclipse during these periods. Sometimes the new moon occurs close enough to a node during two consecutive months to eclipse the Sun on both occasions in two partial eclipses. This means that, in any given year, there will always be at least two solar eclipses, and there can be as many as five.<ref>Harrington, pp. 5\u20137</ref>\n\nEclipses can occur only when the Sun is within about 15 to 18 degrees of a node, (10 to 12 degrees for central eclipses). This is referred to as an eclipse limit, and is given in ranges because the apparent sizes and speeds of the Sun and Moon vary throughout the year. In the time it takes for the Moon to return to a node (draconic month), the apparent position of the Sun has moved about 29 degrees, relative to the nodes.<ref name=\"totality\" /> Since the eclipse limit creates a window of opportunity of up to 36 degrees (24 degrees for central eclipses), it is possible for partial eclipses (or rarely a partial and a central eclipse) to occur in consecutive months.<ref name=\"period\">{{cite web|url=http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/SEsaros/SEperiodicity.html|title=Periodicity of Solar Eclipses|first=Fred|last=Espenak|publisher=NASA Goddard Space Flight Center|website=NASA Eclipse web site|location=Greenbelt, MD|date=August 28, 2009|accessdate=January 15, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/5MCSE/5MCSEcatalog.txt|title=Five Millennium Catalog of Solar Eclipses: -1999 to +3000|author1=Espenak, Fred |author2=Meeus, Jean |publisher=NASA Goddard Space Flight Center|website=NASA Eclipse web site|location=Greenbelt, MD|date=January 26, 2007|accessdate=January 15, 2012}}</ref>\n\n[[File:graph_solar_eclipse_coverage.svg|thumb|Fraction of the Sun's disc covered, ''f'', when the same-sized discs are offset a fraction ''t'' of their diameter.<ref>[[European Space Agency]], \"[https://books.google.com/books?id=h0BWxgEACAAJ Spacecraft flight dynamics]: proceedings of an international symposium, 18\u201322 May 1981-Darmstadt, Germany\", p.347</ref>]]\n\n===Path===\nDuring a central eclipse, the Moon's umbra (or antumbra, in the case of an annular eclipse) moves rapidly from west to east across the Earth.

But at what ''longitudes'' on the Earth's surface the shadow will fall, is a function of the Earth's rotation, and on how much that rotation has slowed down over time. A number called [[\u0394T]] is used in eclipse prediction to take this slowing into account. As the Earth slows, \u0394T increases. \u0394T for dates in the future can only be roughly estimated because the Earth's rotation is slowing irregularly. This means that, although it is possible to predict that there will be a total eclipse on a certain date in the far future, it is not possible to predict in the far future exactly at what longitudes that eclipse will be total. Historical records of eclipses allow estimates of past values of \u0394T and so of the Earth's rotation.\n\n===Duration===\nThe following factors determine the duration of a total solar eclipse (in order of decreasing importance):<ref name=\"longest\"/><ref>M.

The [[Saros cycle|saros]] is probably the best known and one of the most accurate. A saros lasts 6,585.3 days (a little over 18 years), which means that, after this period, a practically identical eclipse will occur. The most notable difference will be a westward shift of about 120\u00b0 in longitude (due to the 0.3 days) and a little in latitude (north-south for odd-numbered cycles, the reverse for even-numbered ones). A saros series always starts with a partial eclipse near one of Earth's polar regions, then shifts over the globe through a series of annular or total eclipses, and ends with a partial eclipse at the opposite polar region. A saros series lasts 1226 to 1550 years and 69 to 87 eclipses, with about 40 to 60 of them being central.<ref>{{cite web|first=Fred |last=Espenak |title=Eclipses and the Saros |url=http://sunearth.gsfc.nasa.gov/eclipse/SEsaros/SEsaros.html |publisher=NASA Goddard Space Flight Center|website=NASA Eclipse web site|date=August 28, 2009 |accessdate=January 15, 2012 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120524183445/sunearth.gsfc.nasa.gov/eclipse/SEsaros/SEsaros.html |archivedate=May 24, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Frequency per year===\nBetween two and five solar eclipses occur every year, with at least one per [[eclipse season]].

Hundreds of millions of years in the past, the Moon was closer to the Earth and therefore apparently larger, so every solar eclipse was total or partial, and there were no annular eclipses. Due to [[tidal acceleration]], the orbit of the Moon around the Earth becomes approximately 3.8&nbsp;cm more distant each year. Millions of years in the future, the Moon will be too far away to fully occlude the Sun, and no total eclipses will occur. In the same timeframe, the Sun may become brighter, making it appear larger in size.<ref name=\"fourmilab\">{{cite web|last=Walker|first=John|url=http://www.fourmilab.ch/images/peri_apo/|title=Moon near Perigee, Earth near Aphelion|website=Fourmilab|date=July 10, 2004|accessdate=March 7, 2010}}</ref> Estimates of the time when the Moon will be unable to occlude the entire Sun when viewed from the Earth range between 650 million<ref>{{cite news|last1=Mayo|first1=Lou|title=WHAT'S UP?

At one time, some scientists hypothesized that there may be a planet (often given the name [[Vulcan (hypothetical planet)|Vulcan]]) even closer to the Sun than Mercury; the only way to confirm its existence would have been to observe it in transit or during a total solar eclipse.

The Earth continues to receive at least 92 percent of the amount of sunlight it receives without an eclipse&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;more if the [[penumbra]] of the Moon's shadow partly misses the Earth. Seen from the Moon, the Earth during a total solar eclipse is mostly brilliantly illuminated, with only a small dark patch showing the Moon's shadow. The brilliantly-lit Earth reflects a lot of light to the Moon. If the [[solar corona|corona]] of the eclipsed Sun were not present, the Moon, illuminated by earthlight, would be easily visible from Earth. This would be essentially the same as the [[earthshine]] which can frequently be seen when the Moon's [[Lunar phase|phase]] is a narrow crescent. In reality, the corona, though much less brilliant than the Sun's [[photosphere]], is much brighter than the Moon illuminated by earthlight. Therefore, by contrast, the Moon during a total solar eclipse appears to be black, with the corona surrounding it.\n\n===Artificial satellites===\n[[File:Eclipse fromISS 2006-03-29.jpg|thumb|The Moon's shadow over [[Turkey]] and [[Cyprus]], seen from the [[International Space Station|ISS]] during a [[Solar eclipse of March 29, 2006|2006 total solar eclipse]].]]\n[[File:ISS Transit composite during Solar Eclipse 8-21-17 near Banner, Wyoming.jpg|thumb|A composite image showing the ISS transit of the Sun while the 2017 solar eclipse was in progress.]]\n\nArtificial satellites can also pass in front of the Sun as seen from the Earth, but none is large enough to cause an eclipse.

Each eclipse is separated by one, five or six [[lunation]]s ([[synodic month]]s), and the midpoint of each season is separated by 173.3 days, which is the mean time for the Sun to travel from one node to the next. The period is a little less than half a calendar year because the lunar nodes slowly regress. Because 223 synodic months is roughly equal to 239 [[anomalistic month]]s and 242 [[draconic month]]s, eclipses with similar geometry recur 223 synodic months (about 6,585.3 days) apart. This period (18 years 11.3 days) is a [[Saros (astronomy)|saros]]. Because 223 synodic months is not identical to 239 anomalistic months or 242 draconic months, saros cycles do not endlessly repeat. Each cycle begins with the Moon's shadow crossing the Earth near the north or south pole, and subsequent events progress toward the other pole until the Moon's shadow misses the Earth and the series ends.<ref name=\"period\"/> Saros cycles are numbered; currently, cycles 117 to 156 are active.\n\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"7\" cellspacing=\"0\" align=\"center\"\n|-\n| colspan=9 align=\"center\" | '''Solar eclipses'''\n|-\n| '''[[Template:Solar eclipse set 1997\u20132000|1997\u20132000]]''' || '''[[Template:Solar eclipse set 2000\u20132003|2000\u20132003]]''' || '''[[Template:Solar eclipse set 2004\u20132007|2004\u20132007]]''' || '''[[Template:Solar eclipse set 2008\u20132011|2008\u20132011]]''' || '''[[Template:Solar eclipse set 2011\u20132014|2011\u20132014]]''' || '''[[Template:Solar eclipse set 2015\u20132018|2015\u20132018]]''' || '''[[Template:Solar eclipse set 2018\u20132021|2018\u20132021]]''' || '''[[Template:Solar eclipse set 2022\u20132025|2022\u20132025]]'''|| '''[[Template:Solar eclipse set 2026\u20132029|2026\u20132029]]'''\n|}\n{{clear}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Wikipedia books|Solar Eclipses}}\n{{Portal|Solar System}}\n{{Div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Besselian elements]]\n* [[Eclipse chasing]]\n* [[Lunar eclipse]]\n* [[Occultation]]\n* [[Solar eclipses in fiction]]\n* [[Solar eclipses on the Moon]]\n* [[Transit of Deimos from Mars]]\n* [[Transit of Phobos from Mars]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite book|first=[[Hermann Mucke (astronomer)|Hermann Mucke]]|last=[[Jean Meeus]]|date=1992|edition=2|title=Canon of Solar Eclipses -2003 to +2526|publisher=Astronomisches B\u00fcro|location=Vienna}}\n* {{cite book|author=Harrington, Philip S.|date=1997|title=Eclipse!

During a ''partial solar eclipse'' (right), the Moon blocks only part of the Sun's disk ([[Solar eclipse of October 23, 2014|October 23, 2014]]).\n|}\n\nA '''solar eclipse''' occurs when a portion of the [[Earth]] is engulfed in a shadow cast by the [[Moon]] which fully or partially blocks sunlight.  This occurs when the [[Sun]], [[Moon]] and [[Earth]] are aligned. Such alignment coincides with a new moon ([[Syzygy (astronomy)|syzygy]]) indicating the Moon is closest to the [[Ecliptic|ecliptic plane]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Science/What_is_an_eclipse|title=What is an eclipse?|work=European Space Agency|access-date=2018-08-04}}</ref>  In a total [[eclipse]], the disk of the Sun is fully obscured by the Moon. In [[#Types|partial and annular eclipses]], only part of the Sun is obscured.\n\nIf the Moon were in a perfectly circular orbit, a little closer to the Earth, and in the same [[ecliptic|orbital plane]], there would be total solar eclipses every new moon. However, since the Moon's orbit is [[inclination|tilted]] at more than 5 degrees to the [[Ecliptic|Earth's orbit around the Sun]], its shadow usually misses Earth.  A solar eclipse can only occur when the Moon is close enough to the [[Ecliptic|ecliptic plane]] during a [[new moon]].  Special conditions must occur for the two events to coincide because the Moon's orbit crosses the ecliptic at its [[orbital node]]s twice every [[draconic month]] (27.212220 days) while a new moon occurs one every [[synodic month]] (29.530587981 days).  Solar (and lunar) eclipses therefore happen only during [[eclipse season]]s resulting in at least two, and up to five, solar eclipses each year; no more than two of which can be total eclipses.<ref name=\"totality\">{{Cite book|title=Totality: Eclipses of the Sun|last=Littmann|first=Mark|last2=Espenak|first2=Fred|last3=Willcox|first3=Ken|date=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-953209-4|pages=18\u201319}}</ref><ref>Five solar eclipses occurred in 1935.{{Cite book|url=http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/eclipse.html|title=NASA Eclipse Web Site|author=NASA|date=September 6, 2009|others=[[Fred Espenak]], Project and Website Manager|chapter=Five Millennium Catalog of Solar Eclipses|accessdate=January 26, 2010|chapterurl=http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/SEcat5/SE1901-2000.html|author-link=NASA}}</ref>\n\nTotal eclipses are rare because the timing of the [[new moon]] within the [[eclipse season]] needs to be more exact for an alignment between the observer (on Earth) and the centers of the [[Sun]] and [[Moon]]. In addition, the elliptical orbit of the [[Moon]] often takes it far enough away from [[Earth]] that its [[apparent size]] is not large enough to block the [[Sun]] entirely.  Total solar eclipses are rare at any particular location because totality exists only along a narrow path on the Earth's surface traced by the Moon's full shadow or [[umbra]].\n\nAn eclipse is a [[List of natural phenomena|natural phenomenon]]. However, in some ancient and modern cultures, solar eclipses were attributed to [[supernatural]] causes or regarded as bad [[omen]]s. A total solar eclipse can be frightening to people who are unaware of its [[astronomy|astronomical]] explanation, as the Sun seems to disappear during the day and the sky darkens in a matter of minutes.\n\nSince [[sungazing|looking directly at the Sun]] can lead to permanent eye damage or blindness, special eye protection or indirect viewing techniques are used when viewing a solar eclipse. It is safe to view only the total phase of a total solar eclipse with the unaided eye and without protection; however worthwhile, this  practice must be undertaken carefully, though the extreme fading of the solar brightness by a factor of over 100 times in the last minute before totality makes it obvious when totality has begun and it is for that extreme variation and the view of the solar corona that leads people to travel to the zone of totality (the partial phases span over two hours while the total phase can only last a maximum of 7.5 minutes for any one location and is usually less). People referred to as ''[[eclipse chasers]]'' or ''umbraphiles'' will travel even to remote locations to observe or witness predicted central solar eclipses.<ref>{{cite news|last=Koukkos|first=Christina|title=Eclipse Chasing, in Pursuit of Total Awe|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/17/travel/17journeys.html|work=The New York Times|date=May 14, 2009|accessdate=January 15, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/11/opinion/11pasachoff.html|title=Why I Never Miss a Solar Eclipse|last=Pasachoff|first=Jay M.|work=The New York Times|date=July 10, 2010|accessdate=January 15, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Types== \n[[File:Solar Eclipse May 20,2012.jpg|thumb|Partial and annular phases of solar eclipse on May 20, 2012]]\nThere are four types of solar eclipses:\n* A '''total eclipse''' occurs when the dark silhouette of the Moon completely obscures the intensely bright light of the Sun, allowing the much fainter [[solar corona]] to be visible.

Hence the Sun appears as a very bright ring, or [[annulus (mathematics)|annulus]], surrounding the dark disk of the Moon.<ref name=\"Harrington10\">Harrington, pp. 9\u201311</ref>\n* A '''hybrid eclipse''' (also called '''annular/total eclipse''') shifts between a total and annular eclipse. At certain points on the surface of Earth, it appears as a total eclipse, whereas at other points it appears as annular. Hybrid eclipses are comparatively rare.<ref name=\"Harrington10\"/>\n* A '''partial eclipse''' occurs when the Sun and Moon are not exactly in line with the Earth and the Moon only partially obscures the Sun. This phenomenon can usually be seen from a large part of the Earth outside of the track of an annular or total eclipse. However, some eclipses can only be seen as a partial eclipse, because the [[umbra]] passes above the Earth's polar regions and never intersects the Earth's surface.<ref name=\"Harrington10\"/> Partial eclipses are virtually unnoticeable in terms of the Sun's brightness, as it takes well over 90% coverage to notice any darkening at all. Even at 99%, it would be no darker than [[civil twilight]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Transit of Venus, Sun\u2013Earth Day 2012|website=nasa.gov|url=http://sunearthday.nasa.gov/2012/facts.php|accessdate=February 7, 2016}}</ref> Of course, partial eclipses (and partial stages of other eclipses) can be observed if one is viewing the Sun through a darkening filter (which should always be used for safety).\n\n[[File:Comparison angular diameter.svg|thumb|Comparison of minimum and maximum apparent sizes of the Sun and Moon (and planets). An annular eclipse can occur when the Sun has a larger apparent size than the Moon, whereas a total eclipse can occur when the Moon has a larger apparent size.]]\nThe Sun's distance from Earth is about 400 times the Moon's distance, and the Sun's [[diameter]] is about 400 times the Moon's diameter. Because these ratios are approximately the same, the Sun and the Moon as seen from Earth appear to be approximately the same size: about 0.5 [[degree of arc]] in angular measure.<ref name=\"Harrington10\"/>\n\nA separate category of solar eclipses is that of the Sun being occluded by a body other than the Earth's Moon, as can be observed at points in space away from the Earth's surface. Two examples are when the crew of [[Apollo 12]] observed the [[:File:Earth Eclipses Sun-ap12-s80-37406.jpg|Earth eclipse the Sun]] in 1969 and when the ''[[Cassini\u2013Huygens|Cassini]]'' [[Space probe|probe]] observed [[:File:Saturn eclipse.jpg|Saturn eclipsing the Sun]] in 2006.\n\nThe Moon's orbit around the Earth is slightly [[ellipse|elliptical]], as is the Earth's orbit around the Sun. The apparent sizes of the Sun and Moon therefore vary.<ref>{{cite web|title=Solar Eclipses |website=University of Tennessee |url=http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/astr161/lect/time/eclipses.html|accessdate=January 15, 2012}}</ref> The [[magnitude of an eclipse]] is the ratio of the apparent size of the Moon to the apparent size of the Sun during an eclipse. An eclipse that occurs when the Moon is near its closest distance to Earth (''i.e.,'' near its [[perigee]]) can be a total eclipse because the Moon will appear to be large enough to completely cover the Sun's bright disk or [[photosphere]]; a total eclipse has a magnitude greater than or equal to 1.000. Conversely, an eclipse that occurs when the Moon is near its farthest distance from Earth (''i.e.,'' near its [[apogee]]) can only be an annular eclipse because the Moon will appear to be slightly smaller than the Sun; the magnitude of an annular eclipse is less than 1.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/total-solar-eclipse/en/|title=How Is the Sun Completely Blocked in an Eclipse?|publisher=[[NASA]]|work=NASA Space Place|date=2009}}</ref>\n\nA hybrid eclipse occurs when the magnitude of an eclipse changes during the event from less to greater than one, so the eclipse appears to be total at locations nearer the midpoint, and annular at other locations nearer the beginning and end, since the sides of the Earth are slightly further away from the Moon.  These eclipses are extremely narrow in their path width and relatively short in their duration at any point compared with fully total eclipses; the 2023 April 20 hybrid eclipse's totality is over a minute in duration at various points along the path of totality.  Like a [[focus (optics)|focal point]], the width and duration of totality and annularity are near zero at the points where the changes between the two occur.<ref>{{cite web|first=Fred|last=Espenak|date=September 26, 2009|title=Solar Eclipses for Beginners|url=http://www.mreclipse.com/Special/SEprimer.html|accessdate=January 15, 2012|website=MrEclipse.com}}</ref>\n\nBecause the Earth's orbit around the Sun is also elliptical, the Earth's distance from the Sun similarly varies throughout the year. This affects the apparent size of the Sun in the same way, but not as much as does the Moon's varying distance from Earth.<ref name=\"Harrington10\"/> When Earth approaches its [[Aphelion|farthest distance from the Sun]] in early July, a total eclipse is somewhat more likely, whereas conditions favour an annular eclipse when Earth approaches its [[perihelion|closest distance to the Sun]] in early January.<ref>Steel, p. 351</ref>\n\n===Terminology for central eclipse===\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| image1    = Solar eclipse visualisation.svg\n| width1    = 250\n| caption1  = Each icon shows the view from the centre of its black spot, representing the Moon (not to scale)\n| image2    = Exit Diamond Ring Effect.jpg\n| width2    = 200\n| caption2  = Diamond ring effect at third contact\u2014the end of totality\u2014with visible prominences\n}}\n''Central eclipse'' is often used as a generic term for a total, annular, or hybrid eclipse.<ref name=\"SEpath\">{{cite web|url=http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/SEpath/SEpath.html|title=Central Solar Eclipses: 1991\u20132050|first=Fred|last=Espenak|date=January 6, 2009|publisher=NASA Goddard Space Flight Center|work=NASA Eclipse web site|location=Greenbelt, MD|accessdate=January 15, 2012}}</ref> This is, however, not completely correct: the definition of a central eclipse is an eclipse during which the central line of the umbra touches the Earth's surface.

The dark gray region between the Moon and Earth is the [[umbra]], where the Sun is completely obscured by the Moon. The small area where the umbra touches Earth's surface is where a total eclipse can be seen. The larger light gray area is the [[penumbra]], in which a partial eclipse can be seen. An observer in the [[Umbra#Antumbra|antumbra]], the area of shadow beyond the umbra, will see an annular eclipse.<ref>Mobberley, pp. 30\u201338</ref>\n\nThe [[Orbit of the Moon|Moon's orbit]] around the Earth is inclined at an angle of just over 5 degrees to the plane of the Earth's orbit around the Sun (the [[ecliptic]]). Because of this, at the time of a new moon, the Moon will usually pass to the north or south of the Sun. A solar eclipse can occur only when new moon occurs close to one of the points (known as [[Orbital node|nodes]]) where the Moon's orbit crosses the ecliptic.<ref name=\"Harrington\">Harrington, pp. 4\u20135</ref>\n\nAs noted above, the Moon's orbit is also [[ellipse|elliptical]]. The Moon's distance from the Earth can vary by about 6% from its average value. Therefore, the Moon's apparent size varies with its distance from the Earth, and it is this effect that leads to the difference between total and annular eclipses. The distance of the Earth from the Sun also varies during the year, but this is a smaller effect. On average, the Moon appears to be slightly smaller than the Sun as seen from the Earth, so the majority (about 60%) of central eclipses are annular. It is only when the Moon is closer to the Earth than average (near its [[perigee]]) that a total eclipse occurs.<ref>{{cite web|first=Ron|last=Hipschman|title=Why Eclipses Happen|website=Exploratorium|url=http://www.exploratorium.edu/eclipse/why.html|accessdate=January 14, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Brewer, Bryan|date=January 14, 1998|title=What Causes an Eclipse?|website=Earth View|url=http://www.earthview.com/tutorial/causes.htm|accessdate=January 14, 2012|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130102203300/http://www.earthview.com/tutorial/causes.htm|archivedate=January 2, 2013}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center; margin: 0.1em auto;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=2 width=120 | &nbsp;\n! colspan=2 width=320 | Moon\n! colspan=2 width=320 | Sun\n|-\n!

This is known as the [[sidereal month]]. However, during one sidereal month, Earth has revolved part way around the Sun, making the average time between one new moon and the next longer than the sidereal month: it is approximately 29.5 days. This is known as the [[synodic month]] and corresponds to what is commonly called the [[lunar month]].<ref name=\"Harrington\"/>\n\nThe Moon crosses from south to north of the ecliptic at its [[ascending node]], and vice versa at its descending node.<ref name=\"Harrington\"/> However, the nodes of the Moon's orbit are gradually moving in a [[retrograde motion]], due to the action of the Sun's gravity on the Moon's motion, and they make a complete circuit every 18.6 years. This regression means that the time between each passage of the Moon through the ascending node is slightly shorter than the sidereal month. This period is called the nodical or [[draconic month]].<ref>Steel, pp. 319\u2013321</ref>\n\nFinally, the Moon's perigee is moving forwards or precessing in its orbit and makes a complete circuit in 8.85 years. The time between one perigee and the next is slightly longer than the sidereal month and known as the [[anomalistic month]].<ref>Steel, pp. 317\u2013319</ref>\n\nThe Moon's orbit intersects with the ecliptic at the two nodes that are 180 degrees apart. Therefore, the new moon occurs close to the nodes at two periods of the year approximately six months (173.3 days) apart, known as [[eclipse season]]s, and there will always be at least one solar eclipse during these periods. Sometimes the new moon occurs close enough to a node during two consecutive months to eclipse the Sun on both occasions in two partial eclipses. This means that, in any given year, there will always be at least two solar eclipses, and there can be as many as five.<ref>Harrington, pp. 5\u20137</ref>\n\nEclipses can occur only when the Sun is within about 15 to 18 degrees of a node, (10 to 12 degrees for central eclipses). This is referred to as an eclipse limit, and is given in ranges because the apparent sizes and speeds of the Sun and Moon vary throughout the year. In the time it takes for the Moon to return to a node (draconic month), the apparent position of the Sun has moved about 29 degrees, relative to the nodes.<ref name=\"totality\" /> Since the eclipse limit creates a window of opportunity of up to 36 degrees (24 degrees for central eclipses), it is possible for partial eclipses (or rarely a partial and a central eclipse) to occur in consecutive months.<ref name=\"period\">{{cite web|url=http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/SEsaros/SEperiodicity.html|title=Periodicity of Solar Eclipses|first=Fred|last=Espenak|publisher=NASA Goddard Space Flight Center|website=NASA Eclipse web site|location=Greenbelt, MD|date=August 28, 2009|accessdate=January 15, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/5MCSE/5MCSEcatalog.txt|title=Five Millennium Catalog of Solar Eclipses: -1999 to +3000|author1=Espenak, Fred |author2=Meeus, Jean |publisher=NASA Goddard Space Flight Center|website=NASA Eclipse web site|location=Greenbelt, MD|date=January 26, 2007|accessdate=January 15, 2012}}</ref>\n\n[[File:graph_solar_eclipse_coverage.svg|thumb|Fraction of the Sun's disc covered, ''f'', when the same-sized discs are offset a fraction ''t'' of their diameter.<ref>[[European Space Agency]], \"[https://books.google.com/books?id=h0BWxgEACAAJ Spacecraft flight dynamics]: proceedings of an international symposium, 18\u201322 May 1981-Darmstadt, Germany\", p.347</ref>]]\n\n===Path===\nDuring a central eclipse, the Moon's umbra (or antumbra, in the case of an annular eclipse) moves rapidly from west to east across the Earth.

But at what ''longitudes'' on the Earth's surface the shadow will fall, is a function of the Earth's rotation, and on how much that rotation has slowed down over time. A number called [[\u0394T]] is used in eclipse prediction to take this slowing into account. As the Earth slows, \u0394T increases. \u0394T for dates in the future can only be roughly estimated because the Earth's rotation is slowing irregularly. This means that, although it is possible to predict that there will be a total eclipse on a certain date in the far future, it is not possible to predict in the far future exactly at what longitudes that eclipse will be total. Historical records of eclipses allow estimates of past values of \u0394T and so of the Earth's rotation.\n\n===Duration===\nThe following factors determine the duration of a total solar eclipse (in order of decreasing importance):<ref name=\"longest\"/><ref>M. Littman, et al.</ref>\n# The Moon being almost exactly at perigee (making its angular diameter as large as possible).\n# The Earth being very near [[apsis|aphelion]] (furthest away from the Sun in its elliptical orbit, making its angular diameter nearly as small as possible).\n# The midpoint of the eclipse being very close to the Earth's equator, where the rotational velocity is greatest.\n# The vector of the eclipse path at the midpoint of the eclipse aligning with the vector of the Earth's rotation (i.e. not diagonal but due east).\n# The midpoint of the eclipse being near the [[subsolar point]] (the part of the Earth closest to the Sun).\nThe longest eclipse that has been calculated thus far is the eclipse of [[Solar eclipse of July 16, 2186|July 16, 2186]] (with a maximum duration of 7 minutes 29 seconds over northern Guyana).<ref name=\"longest\"/>\n\n==Occurrence and cycles==\n{{Main|Eclipse cycle}}\n\n[[File:Total Solar Eclipse Paths- 1001-2000.gif|thumb|330x330px|Total solar eclipse paths: 1001\u20132000, showing that total solar eclipses occur almost everywhere on Earth.

The [[Saros cycle|saros]] is probably the best known and one of the most accurate. A saros lasts 6,585.3 days (a little over 18 years), which means that, after this period, a practically identical eclipse will occur. The most notable difference will be a westward shift of about 120\u00b0 in longitude (due to the 0.3 days) and a little in latitude (north-south for odd-numbered cycles, the reverse for even-numbered ones). A saros series always starts with a partial eclipse near one of Earth's polar regions, then shifts over the globe through a series of annular or total eclipses, and ends with a partial eclipse at the opposite polar region.

Due to [[tidal acceleration]], the orbit of the Moon around the Earth becomes approximately 3.8&nbsp;cm more distant each year. Millions of years in the future, the Moon will be too far away to fully occlude the Sun, and no total eclipses will occur.

But these events are extremely rare because of their short durations.

At one time, some scientists hypothesized that there may be a planet (often given the name [[Vulcan (hypothetical planet)|Vulcan]]) even closer to the Sun than Mercury; the only way to confirm its existence would have been to observe it in transit or during a total solar eclipse. No such planet was ever found, and [[general relativity]] has since explained the observations that led astronomers to suggest that Vulcan might exist.<ref>{{cite book|author=Grego, Peter|date=2008|title=Venus and Mercury, and How to Observe Them|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0387742854 |page=3}}</ref>\n\n===Earthshine===\n[[File:An EPIC Eclipse.gif|thumb|left|From space, the Moon's shadow during a solar eclipse appears as a dark spot moving across the Earth.]]\nDuring a total solar eclipse, the Moon's shadow covers only a small fraction of the Earth. The Earth continues to receive at least 92 percent of the amount of sunlight it receives without an eclipse&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;more if the [[penumbra]] of the Moon's shadow partly misses the Earth. Seen from the Moon, the Earth during a total solar eclipse is mostly brilliantly illuminated, with only a small dark patch showing the Moon's shadow. The brilliantly-lit Earth reflects a lot of light to the Moon. If the [[solar corona|corona]] of the eclipsed Sun were not present, the Moon, illuminated by earthlight, would be easily visible from Earth. This would be essentially the same as the [[earthshine]] which can frequently be seen when the Moon's [[Lunar phase|phase]] is a narrow crescent. In reality, the corona, though much less brilliant than the Sun's [[photosphere]], is much brighter than the Moon illuminated by earthlight. Therefore, by contrast, the Moon during a total solar eclipse appears to be black, with the corona surrounding it.\n\n===Artificial satellites===\n[[File:Eclipse fromISS 2006-03-29.jpg|thumb|The Moon's shadow over [[Turkey]] and [[Cyprus]], seen from the [[International Space Station|ISS]] during a [[Solar eclipse of March 29, 2006|2006 total solar eclipse]].]]\n[[File:ISS Transit composite during Solar Eclipse 8-21-17 near Banner, Wyoming.jpg|thumb|A composite image showing the ISS transit of the Sun while the 2017 solar eclipse was in progress.]]\n\nArtificial satellites can also pass in front of the Sun as seen from the Earth, but none is large enough to cause an eclipse. At the altitude of the [[International Space Station]], for example, an object would need to be about {{convert|3.35|km|mi|2|abbr=on}} across to blot the Sun out entirely. These transits are difficult to watch because the zone of visibility is very small. The satellite passes over the face of the Sun in about a second, typically.

Each eclipse is separated by one, five or six [[lunation]]s ([[synodic month]]s), and the midpoint of each season is separated by 173.3 days, which is the mean time for the Sun to travel from one node to the next. The period is a little less than half a calendar year because the lunar nodes slowly regress. Because 223 synodic months is roughly equal to 239 [[anomalistic month]]s and 242 [[draconic month]]s, eclipses with similar geometry recur 223 synodic months (about 6,585.3 days) apart. This period (18 years 11.3 days) is a [[Saros (astronomy)|saros]]. Because 223 synodic months is not identical to 239 anomalistic months or 242 draconic months, saros cycles do not endlessly repeat. Each cycle begins with the Moon's shadow crossing the Earth near the north or south pole, and subsequent events progress toward the other pole until the Moon's shadow misses the Earth and the series ends.<ref name=\"period\"/> Saros cycles are numbered; currently, cycles 117 to 156 are active.\n\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"7\" cellspacing=\"0\" align=\"center\"\n|-\n| colspan=9 align=\"center\" | '''Solar eclipses'''\n|-\n| '''[[Template:Solar eclipse set 1997\u20132000|1997\u20132000]]''' || '''[[Template:Solar eclipse set 2000\u20132003|2000\u20132003]]''' || '''[[Template:Solar eclipse set 2004\u20132007|2004\u20132007]]''' || '''[[Template:Solar eclipse set 2008\u20132011|2008\u20132011]]''' || '''[[Template:Solar eclipse set 2011\u20132014|2011\u20132014]]''' || '''[[Template:Solar eclipse set 2015\u20132018|2015\u20132018]]''' || '''[[Template:Solar eclipse set 2018\u20132021|2018\u20132021]]''' || '''[[Template:Solar eclipse set 2022\u20132025|2022\u20132025]]'''|| '''[[Template:Solar eclipse set 2026\u20132029|2026\u20132029]]'''\n|}\n{{clear}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Wikipedia books|Solar Eclipses}}\n{{Portal|Solar System}}\n{{Div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Besselian elements]]\n* [[Eclipse chasing]]\n* [[Lunar eclipse]]\n* [[Occultation]]\n* [[Solar eclipses in fiction]]\n* [[Solar eclipses on the Moon]]\n* [[Transit of Deimos from Mars]]\n* [[Transit of Phobos from Mars]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite book|first=[[Hermann Mucke (astronomer)|Hermann Mucke]]|last=[[Jean Meeus]]|date=1992|edition=2|title=Canon of Solar Eclipses -2003 to +2526|publisher=Astronomisches B\u00fcro|location=Vienna}}\n* {{cite book|author=Harrington, Philip S.|date=1997|title=Eclipse!

The film presents a thinly fictionalized account of the events surrounding the assassination of democratic [[Greece|Greek]] politician [[Grigoris Lambrakis]] in 1963. With its satirical view of Greek politics, its dark sense of humor, and its downbeat ending, the film captures the director's outrage about the [[Greek military junta of 1967\u201374|junta that ruled Greece]] at the time of its making.\n\nThe film stars [[Jean-Louis Trintignant]] as the investigating magistrate (an [[Analogue (literature)|analogue]] of [[Christos Sartzetakis]] who later served as president of Greece from 1985 to 1990). International stars [[Yves Montand]] and [[Irene Papas]] also appear, but despite their star billing have very little screen time. [[Jacques Perrin]], who co-produced, plays a key role as a photojournalist. The film's title refers to a popular Greek protest slogan ({{lang-el|\u0396\u03b5\u03b9}}, {{IPA-el|\u02c8zi|IPA}}) meaning \"he lives,\" in reference to Lambrakis.\n\n''Z'' was the first film&mdash;and one of only a handful&mdash;to be nominated for both the [[Academy Awards]] for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] and [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]]. It won the latter, as well as the [[Jury Prize (Cannes Film Festival)|Jury Prize]] at the [[Cannes Film Festival]], the [[BAFTA Award for Best Film Music]], and the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign-Language Foreign Film]]; at the [[27th Golden Globe Awards]], the producers of ''Z'' refused the award to protest against the film's exclusion from the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture \u2013 Drama|Best Motion Picture - Drama]] category.<ref name=GlobeRefusal>{{cite web|url=https://www.goldenglobes.com/trivia-0|title=Trivia|work=Golden Globes website|accessdate=2 November 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nThe story begins with the closing moments of a rather dull government lecture and slide show on agricultural policy, after which the leader of the security police of a [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] military-dominated government takes over the podium for an impassioned speech describing the government's program to combat [[leftism]], using the metaphors of \"a [[mildew]] of the mind\", an [[infiltration tactic|infiltration]] of \"[[-ism|isms]]\", or \"sunspots\". \n\nThe scene shifts to preparations for a [[political rally|rally]] of the opposition faction where the [[pacifist]] Deputy is to give a speech advocating nuclear disarmament. There have been attempts by the government to prevent the speech's delivery. The venue has been changed to a much smaller hall, logistical problems have appeared out of nowhere, and the people handing out leaflets about the change of venue are attacked by thugs under the command of the police. On his way to the venue, the Deputy is hit on the head by a right-wing [[anticommunist]] protestor,  some of whom are sponsored by the government, but carries on with his sharp speech. As the Deputy crosses the street from the hall after giving his speech, a delivery truck speeds past him and a man on the open truck bed strikes him down with a club. The injury eventually proves fatal, and the police manipulate witnesses to force the conclusion that the Deputy was simply run over by a [[drunk driving|drunken driver]].\n\nHowever, the police do not control the hospital, where the [[autopsy]] disproves their interpretation. The [[inquisitorial system|examining magistrate]], with the assistance of a photojournalist (Perrin), now uncovers sufficient evidence to indict not only the two right-wing militants who committed the murder, but also four high-ranking military police officers. The action of the film concludes with one of the Deputy's associates rushing to see his widow to give her the surprising news of the officers' indictments. The widow looks distressed, appearing not to believe things will change for the better.\n\nAn [[epilogue]] provides a synopsis of the subsequent turns of events. Instead of justice's being served, the prosecutor is mysteriously removed from the case, several key witnesses die under suspicious circumstances, the assassins receive relatively short sentences, the officers receive only administrative reprimands, the Deputy's close associates die or are deported, and the photojournalist is sent to prison for disclosing official documents. The heads of the government do resign after public disapproval, but, before elections are carried out, a [[coup d'etat]] occurs and the military seize power. They ban [[modern art]], [[popular music]] and [[avant-garde]] novelists, as well as [[Modern elementary mathematics|modern mathematics]], classic and modern philosophers, and the use of the term \"[[Zeta|\u0396]]\" ({{lang-el|z\u00edta}}, or {{lang-el|zi}}, used by protesters against the former government), which referred to The Deputy and means: \"He lives.\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Jean-Louis Trintignant]] as The Examining Magistrate (based on [[Christos Sartzetakis]])\n* [[Yves Montand]] as The Deputy ([[Grigoris Lambrakis]])\n* [[Irene Papas]] as Helene, the Deputy's wife\n* [[Pierre Dux]] as The General (the main antagonist, based on [[Konstantinos Mitsou]])\n* [[Jacques Perrin]] as Photojournalist (Giorgos Bertsos)\n* [[Charles Denner]] as Manuel\n* [[Fran\u00e7ois P\u00e9rier]] as Public prosecutor\n* [[Georges G\u00e9ret]] as Nick\n* [[Bernard Fresson]] as Matt\n* [[Marcel Bozzuffi]] as Vago (Emmanouel Emmannouilidis - man who struck Lambrakis)\n* [[Julien Guiomar]] as The Colonel (based on Efthimios Kamoutsis)\n* [[Magali No\u00ebl]] as Nick's sister\n* [[Renato Salvatori]] as Yago (Spyro Gotzamanis - the driver)\n* Clotilde Joanno as Shoula\n* [[Maurice Baquet]] as The Mason (Manolis Hatziapostolou)\n* [[G\u00e9rard Darrieu]] as Barone\n* [[Jean Bouise]] as Georges Pirou\n* [[Jean-Pierre Miquel]] as Pierre\n* Van Doude as The Hospital Director\n* [[Jean Dast\u00e9]] as Ilya Coste\n* Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Gobbi as Jimmy, the boxer\n* Guy Mairesse as Dumas\n* [[Andr\u00e9e Tainsy]] as Nick's mother\n* Eva Simonet as Niki\n* [[Hassan El-Hassani]] as a military officer\n* Sid Ahmed Agoumi as The General's driver\n* [[Raoul Coutard]] (''uncredited'') as the English Surgeon\n* [[Fran\u00e7oise Bonnot]] (''uncredited'') as the final voiceover\n* [[Said Kabouya]] (''uncredited'') as the valet\n}}\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Theatre Champs Elysees 35.jpg|thumb|267px|Ballet scenes were shot at the [[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es]] in Paris]]\n\nThe 1963 murder of Greek politician and physician [[Grigoris Lambrakis]] and subsequent [[Greek military junta of 1967\u20131974|military junta]] served as the basis for the story.<ref>{{cite book |last=Shaw |first=Tony |date=2014 |title=Cinematic Terror: A Global History of Terrorism on Film |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing USA |p=105 |isbn=978-1441158093}}</ref> Among Costa-Gavras' references to the actual events was the frequency with which the military compared ideologies to diseases, seen when the General compares [[-isms]] to [[mildew]].<ref name=\"Costa\">{{cite AV media |last=[[Costa-Gavras]] |first= |date=2002 |title=Z Commentary Track |medium=DVD |publisher=Wellspring Media}}</ref> The Magistrate was based on real-life Greek jurist [[Christos Sartzetakis]].<ref>{{cite book |author1=Oliver Boyd Barrett |author2=David Herrera |author3=James A.

American viewers infer parallels between the film and the [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy]], particularly given how some stylistic elements seem to mimic the [[Zapruder film]].

The Greek junta had placed the composer under house arrest but he was able to give his approval to Costa-Gavras for the use of existing musical pieces.\n\nThe film features, but does not credit, [[Pierre Henry]]'s contemporary hit song, \"[[Psych\u00e9 Rock]]\". The soundtrack as released on [[LP album|LP]] and [[CD]] replaces Henry's song with a similar track written by Theodorakis named \"Caf\u00e9 Rock.\"\n\n# Main Title (Antonis) from the \"[[Mauthausen Trilogy]]\" of Mikis Theodorakis\n# The Smiling Youth \n# The Chase-The Smiling Youth\n# Murmur of the Heart\n# Cafe Rock\n# Arrival of Helen-The Smiling Youth\n# Batucada\n# The Smiling Youth (Bouzouki Version)\n# The Smiling Youth\n# Who's Not Talking About Easter\n# Finale-The Smiling Youth\n# Murmur of the Heart\n# In This Town\n\n\"The Happy Youth\" and \"Who's Not Talking About Easter\" were among the poems adapted from [[Brendan Behan]]'s play ''[[The Hostage (play)|The Hostage]]'' by Theodorakis in 1962. By referring to the Irish struggle against British rule rather than Greek realities, they offered a way to circumvent censorship in Greece and condemn Greece's post-war right-wing establishment. \"The Smiling Youth\" (\u03c4\u03bf \u03b3\u03b5\u03bb\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03cc \u03c0\u03b1\u03b9\u03b4\u03af) was also one of the nicknames of Lambrakis.\n\n==Reception==\nPrints of the film were acquired by the [[Black Panther Party]] and shown at underground screenings.<ref name=\"cine\" /> An advance copy of the film was shown at the [[United Front Against Fascism]] conference in 1969.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Sharpe |first1=Kenan Bezhat |title=Directing the Revolution |url=https://www.jacobinmag.com/2018/11/costa-gavras-z-1968-radical-cinema |website=Jacobin |publisher=Jacobin Magazine |accessdate=22 June 2019 |date=8 November 2018}}</ref>\n\nIt first aired on American television on [[The ABC Monday Night Movie]] in March 1974.\n\n===Critical response===\nAt the time of release, ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' film critic [[Roger Ebert]], who named ''Z'' the best film of 1969, liked the screenplay and its message, and wrote, \"[''Z''] is a film of our time. It is about how even moral victories are corrupted. It will make you weep and will make you angry. It will tear your guts out...When the Army junta staged its coup in 1967, the right-wing generals and the police chief were cleared of all charges and 'rehabilitated.' Those responsible for unmasking the assassination now became political criminals. These would seem to be completely political events, but the young director Costa-Gavras has told them in a style that is almost unbearably exciting. ''Z'' is at the same time a political cry of rage and a brilliant suspense thriller. It even ends in a chase: Not through the streets but through a maze of facts, alibis and official corruption.\"<ref>{{cite news |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19691230/REVIEWS/912300301/1023 |last=Ebert |first=Roger |newspaper=The Chicago Sun-Times |title=Z |date=December 30, 1969 |accessdate=2011-02-02}}</ref>\n\nIn 2006, [[James Berardinelli]] wrote, \"''Z'' was the third feature film from Greek-born Costa-Gavras, but it is the movie that captured him to the world's attention, winning a Best Foreign Language Film Oscar.

In the U.S., the Vietnam War was on the front burner, the populace was passionately engaged, and the police riots outside the '68 Chicago Democratic Convention and the murder of Black Panther [[Fred Hampton]] were raw wounds.

film|political]] [[Thriller film|thriller]] film directed by [[Costa-Gavras]], with a screenplay by Gavras and [[Jorge Sempr\u00fan]], based on the 1966 novel of the same name by [[Vassilis Vassilikos]]. The film presents a thinly fictionalized account of the events surrounding the assassination of democratic [[Greece|Greek]] politician [[Grigoris Lambrakis]] in 1963. With its satirical view of Greek politics, its dark sense of humor, and its downbeat ending, the film captures the director's outrage about the [[Greek military junta of 1967\u201374|junta that ruled Greece]] at the time of its making.\n\nThe film stars [[Jean-Louis Trintignant]] as the investigating magistrate (an [[Analogue (literature)|analogue]] of [[Christos Sartzetakis]] who later served as president of Greece from 1985 to 1990). International stars [[Yves Montand]] and [[Irene Papas]] also appear, but despite their star billing have very little screen time. [[Jacques Perrin]], who co-produced, plays a key role as a photojournalist. The film's title refers to a popular Greek protest slogan ({{lang-el|\u0396\u03b5\u03b9}}, {{IPA-el|\u02c8zi|IPA}}) meaning \"he lives,\" in reference to Lambrakis.\n\n''Z'' was the first film&mdash;and one of only a handful&mdash;to be nominated for both the [[Academy Awards]] for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] and [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]]. It won the latter, as well as the [[Jury Prize (Cannes Film Festival)|Jury Prize]] at the [[Cannes Film Festival]], the [[BAFTA Award for Best Film Music]], and the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign-Language Foreign Film]]; at the [[27th Golden Globe Awards]], the producers of ''Z'' refused the award to protest against the film's exclusion from the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture \u2013 Drama|Best Motion Picture - Drama]] category.<ref name=GlobeRefusal>{{cite web|url=https://www.goldenglobes.com/trivia-0|title=Trivia|work=Golden Globes website|accessdate=2 November 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nThe story begins with the closing moments of a rather dull government lecture and slide show on agricultural policy, after which the leader of the security police of a [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] military-dominated government takes over the podium for an impassioned speech describing the government's program to combat [[leftism]], using the metaphors of \"a [[mildew]] of the mind\", an [[infiltration tactic|infiltration]] of \"[[-ism|isms]]\", or \"sunspots\". \n\nThe scene shifts to preparations for a [[political rally|rally]] of the opposition faction where the [[pacifist]] Deputy is to give a speech advocating nuclear disarmament. There have been attempts by the government to prevent the speech's delivery. The venue has been changed to a much smaller hall, logistical problems have appeared out of nowhere, and the people handing out leaflets about the change of venue are attacked by thugs under the command of the police. On his way to the venue, the Deputy is hit on the head by a right-wing [[anticommunist]] protestor,  some of whom are sponsored by the government, but carries on with his sharp speech. As the Deputy crosses the street from the hall after giving his speech, a delivery truck speeds past him and a man on the open truck bed strikes him down with a club. The injury eventually proves fatal, and the police manipulate witnesses to force the conclusion that the Deputy was simply run over by a [[drunk driving|drunken driver]].\n\nHowever, the police do not control the hospital, where the [[autopsy]] disproves their interpretation. The [[inquisitorial system|examining magistrate]], with the assistance of a photojournalist (Perrin), now uncovers sufficient evidence to indict not only the two right-wing militants who committed the murder, but also four high-ranking military police officers. The action of the film concludes with one of the Deputy's associates rushing to see his widow to give her the surprising news of the officers' indictments. The widow looks distressed, appearing not to believe things will change for the better.\n\nAn [[epilogue]] provides a synopsis of the subsequent turns of events. Instead of justice's being served, the prosecutor is mysteriously removed from the case, several key witnesses die under suspicious circumstances, the assassins receive relatively short sentences, the officers receive only administrative reprimands, the Deputy's close associates die or are deported, and the photojournalist is sent to prison for disclosing official documents. The heads of the government do resign after public disapproval, but, before elections are carried out, a [[coup d'etat]] occurs and the military seize power. They ban [[modern art]], [[popular music]] and [[avant-garde]] novelists, as well as [[Modern elementary mathematics|modern mathematics]], classic and modern philosophers, and the use of the term \"[[Zeta|\u0396]]\" ({{lang-el|z\u00edta}}, or {{lang-el|zi}} used by protesters against the former government), which referred to The Deputy and means: \"He lives.\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Jean-Louis Trintignant]] as The Examining Magistrate (based on [[Christos Sartzetakis]])\n* [[Yves Montand]] as The Deputy ([[Grigoris Lambrakis]])\n* [[Irene Papas]] as Helene, the Deputy's wife\n* [[Pierre Dux]] as The General (the main antagonist, based on [[Konstantinos Mitsou]])\n* [[Jacques Perrin]] as Photojournalist (Giorgos Bertsos)\n* [[Charles Denner]] as Manuel\n* [[Fran\u00e7ois P\u00e9rier]] as Public prosecutor\n* [[Georges G\u00e9ret]] as Nick\n* [[Bernard Fresson]] as Matt\n* [[Marcel Bozzuffi]] as Vago (Emmanouel Emmannouilidis - man who struck Lambrakis)\n* [[Julien Guiomar]] as The Colonel (based on Efthimios Kamoutsis)\n* [[Magali No\u00ebl]] as Nick's sister\n* [[Renato Salvatori]] as Yago (Spyro Gotzamanis - the driver)\n* Clotilde Joanno as Shoula\n* [[Maurice Baquet]] as The Mason (Manolis Hatziapostolou)\n* [[G\u00e9rard Darrieu]] as Barone\n* [[Jean Bouise]] as Georges Pirou\n* [[Jean-Pierre Miquel]] as Pierre\n* Van Doude as The Hospital Director\n* [[Jean Dast\u00e9]] as Ilya Coste\n* Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Gobbi as Jimmy, the boxer\n* Guy Mairesse as Dumas\n* [[Andr\u00e9e Tainsy]] as Nick's mother\n* Eva Simonet as Niki\n* [[Hassan El-Hassani]] as a military officer\n* Sid Ahmed Agoumi as The General's driver\n* [[Raoul Coutard]] (''uncredited'') as the English Surgeon\n* [[Fran\u00e7oise Bonnot]] (''uncredited'') as the final voiceover\n* [[Said Kabouya]] (''uncredited'') as the valet\n}}\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Theatre Champs Elysees 35.jpg|thumb|267px|Ballet scenes were shot at the [[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es]] in Paris]]\n\nThe 1963 murder of Greek politician and physician [[Grigoris Lambrakis]] and subsequent [[Greek military junta of 1967\u20131974|military junta]] served as the basis for the story.<ref>{{cite book |last=Shaw |first=Tony |date=2014 |title=Cinematic Terror: A Global History of Terrorism on Film |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing USA |p=105 |isbn=978-1441158093}}</ref> Among Costa-Gavras' references to the actual events was the frequency with which the military compared ideologies to diseases, seen when the General compares [[-isms]] to [[mildew]].<ref name=\"Costa\">{{cite AV media |last=[[Costa-Gavras]] |first= |date=2002 |title=Z Commentary Track |medium=DVD |publisher=Wellspring Media}}</ref> The Magistrate was based on real-life Greek jurist [[Christos Sartzetakis]].<ref>{{cite book |author1=Oliver Boyd Barrett |author2=David Herrera |author3=James A.

American viewers infer parallels between the film and the [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy]], particularly given how some stylistic elements seem to mimic the [[Zapruder film]]. That said, Costa-Gavras has stated that the Zapruder film had not been widely circulated in Europe at the time and that Kennedy's assassination did not influence the production.<ref name=\"cine\">{{cite journal |title=Costa-Gavras Talks About Z |journal=Cin\u00e9asta |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=12\u201316 |jstor=43551774 |year=1969 }}</ref>\n\n[[Principal photography]] took place in [[Algiers]] at actor [[Jacques Perrin]]'s suggestion, which the filmmakers approved for its [[Mediterranean]] environment and because the Ministry of Culture was accommodating.<ref name=\"Costa\"/> In Algiers, [[Hotel St. Georges]] and the central square were filming locations, while Paris' [[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es]] was used for the ballet scenes.<ref name=\"Costa\"/> [[Marcel Bozzuffi]] performed his own stunts wrestling on the \"Kamikaze\" vehicle due to the production's lack of budget for professional stunt performers.<ref name=\"Costa\"/>\n\nCosta-Gavras chose ''Z'' as the title of the film based on its common occurrence in Greek [[graffiti]], for \"He lives\" (or even \"Lambrakis you live; be our guide!\" [\u039b\u03b1\u03bc\u03c0\u03c1\u03ac\u03ba\u03b7 \u03b6\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2, \u03b5\u03c3\u03cd \u03bc\u03b1\u03c2 \u03bf\u03b4\u03b7\u03b3\u03b5\u03af\u03c2!; ''Lambr\u00e1ki zis, es\u00fd mas odig\u00eds!'']); Costa-Gavras acknowledged a one-letter film title was unconventional and said [[Yves Montand]] expressed concern it would be confused with ''[[Zorro]]'', but Costa-Gavras said the novelty of the idea won him over.<ref name=\"Costa\"/>\n\n==Soundtrack==\nThe soundtrack, by [[Mikis Theodorakis]], was a hit record. The Greek junta had placed the composer under house arrest but he was able to give his approval to Costa-Gavras for the use of existing musical pieces.\n\nThe film features, but does not credit, [[Pierre Henry]]'s contemporary hit song, \"[[Psych\u00e9 Rock]]\". The soundtrack as released on [[LP album|LP]] and [[CD]] replaces Henry's song with a similar track written by Theodorakis named \"Caf\u00e9 Rock.\"\n\n# Main Title (Antonis) from the \"[[Mauthausen Trilogy]]\" of Mikis Theodorakis\n# The Smiling Youth \n# The Chase-The Smiling Youth\n# Murmur of the Heart\n# Cafe Rock\n# Arrival of Helen-The Smiling Youth\n# Batucada\n# The Smiling Youth (Bouzouki Version)\n# The Smiling Youth\n# Who's Not Talking About Easter\n# Finale-The Smiling Youth\n# Murmur of the Heart\n# In This Town\n\n\"The Happy Youth\" and \"Who's Not Talking About Easter\" were among the poems adapted from [[Brendan Behan]]'s play ''[[The Hostage (play)|The Hostage]]'' by Theodorakis in 1962. By referring to the Irish struggle against British rule rather than Greek realities, they offered a way to circumvent censorship in Greece and condemn Greece's post-war right-wing establishment. \"The Smiling Youth\" (\u03c4\u03bf \u03b3\u03b5\u03bb\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03cc \u03c0\u03b1\u03b9\u03b4\u03af) was also one of the nicknames of Lambrakis.\n\n==Reception==\nPrints of the film were acquired by the [[Black Panther Party]] and shown at underground screenings.<ref name=\"cine\" /> An advance copy of the film was shown at the [[United Front Against Fascism]] conference in 1969.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Sharpe |first1=Kenan Bezhat |title=Directing the Revolution |url=https://www.jacobinmag.com/2018/11/costa-gavras-z-1968-radical-cinema |website=Jacobin |publisher=Jacobin Magazine |accessdate=22 June 2019 |date=8 November 2018}}</ref>\n\nIt first aired on American television on [[The ABC Monday Night Movie]] in March 1974.\n\n===Critical response===\nAt the time of release, ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' film critic [[Roger Ebert]], who named ''Z'' the best film of 1969, liked the screenplay and its message, and wrote, \"[''Z''] is a film of our time. It is about how even moral victories are corrupted. It will make you weep and will make you angry. It will tear your guts out...When the Army junta staged its coup in 1967, the right-wing generals and the police chief were cleared of all charges and 'rehabilitated.' Those responsible for unmasking the assassination now became political criminals. These would seem to be completely political events, but the young director Costa-Gavras has told them in a style that is almost unbearably exciting. ''Z'' is at the same time a political cry of rage and a brilliant suspense thriller. It even ends in a chase: Not through the streets but through a maze of facts, alibis and official corruption.\"<ref>{{cite news |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19691230/REVIEWS/912300301/1023 |last=Ebert |first=Roger |newspaper=The Chicago Sun-Times |title=Z |date=December 30, 1969 |accessdate=2011-02-02}}</ref>\n\nIn 2006, [[James Berardinelli]] wrote, \"''Z'' was the third feature film from Greek-born Costa-Gavras, but it is the movie that captured him to the world's attention, winning a Best Foreign Language Film Oscar.
