Wildfires sparked mainly by lightning threatened to converge into single, vast blazes, crossed natural firebreaks such as rivers and interstate highways, and demanded an unprecedented suppression response of firefighting resources from across the country.  Regular activities such as Forth of July celebrations, sporting events, tourism, and daily life were profoundly interrupted for millions of residents and visitors in the northeastern part of the state.\n\n==Background==\nFlorida had historically been considered as an area of lower susceptibility for wildfires, due to its high humidity and rainfall levels.<ref name=\"FEMA Report\">{{cite web|url=https://www.usfa.fema.gov/downloads/pdf/publications/tr-126.pdf|title=Wildland Fires Florida 1998|publisher=United States Fire Administration|accessdate=26 March 2020}}</ref> An [[El Nino]] during the [[1997-98 El Ni\u00f1o event|winter of 1998]] produced above-average rainfall, which enabled extensive growth of underbrush and vegetation in the state's forests.

These territories have varying legal status and different levels of autonomy, although all (except those with no permanent inhabitants) have representation in both France's [[National Assembly (France)|National Assembly]] and [[Senate (France)|Senate]], which together make up the [[French Parliament]]. Their citizens have [[French nationality law|French nationality]] and vote for the [[president of France]]. They have the right to vote in elections to the [[European Parliament]] (French citizens living overseas currently vote in the [[Overseas Territories of France (European Parliament constituency)|Overseas constituency]]). Overseas France includes island territories in the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]], [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] and [[Indian Ocean|Indian Oceans]], [[French Guiana]] on the [[South America|South American]] continent, and several [[list of Antarctic and subantarctic islands|periantarctic islands]] as well as a claim in [[Antarctica]].\n\nAlmost all inhabited French administrative divisions outside Europe are classified as either [[overseas department and region|overseas departments/regions]] or [[overseas collectivity|overseas collectivities]]; these statuses are very different from one another from a legal and administrative standpoint. Overseas regions have exactly the same status as mainland France's regions. The French constitution provides that, in general, French laws and regulations (France's civil code, penal code, administrative law, social laws, tax laws, etc.) apply to French overseas regions the same as in mainland France, but can be adapted as needed to suit the region's particular needs. Hence, the local administrations of French overseas regions cannot themselves pass new laws, whereas the overseas collectivities are empowered to make their own laws, except in certain areas reserved to the French national government (such as defense, international relations, trade and currency, and judicial and administrative law). The overseas collectivities are governed by local elected assemblies and by the French Parliament and [[Political system of France#Executive branch|French government]], with a [[French government ministers|cabinet member]], the [[Ministry of Overseas France|Minister of Overseas France]], in charge of issues related to the overseas territories.

These territories have varying legal status and different levels of autonomy, although all (except those with no permanent inhabitants) have representation in both France's [[National Assembly (France)|National Assembly]] and [[Senate (France)|Senate]], which together make up the [[French Parliament]]. Their citizens have [[French nationality law|French nationality]] and vote for the [[president of France]]. They have the right to vote in elections to the [[European Parliament]] (French citizens living overseas currently vote in the [[Overseas Territories of France (European Parliament constituency)|Overseas constituency]]). Overseas France includes island territories in the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]], [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] and [[Indian Ocean|Indian Oceans]], [[French Guiana]] on the [[South America|South American]] continent, and several [[list of Antarctic and subantarctic islands|periantarctic islands]] as well as a claim in [[Antarctica]].\n\nAlmost all inhabited French administrative divisions outside Europe are classified as either [[overseas department and region|overseas departments/regions]] or [[overseas collectivity|overseas collectivities]]; these statuses are very different from one another from a legal and administrative standpoint. Overseas regions have exactly the same status as mainland France's regions. The French constitution provides that, in general, French laws and regulations (France's civil code, penal code, administrative law, social laws, tax laws, etc.) apply to French overseas regions the same as in mainland France, but can be adapted as needed to suit the region's particular needs. Hence, the local administrations of French overseas regions cannot themselves pass new laws, whereas the overseas collectivities are empowered to make their own laws, except in certain areas reserved to the French national government (such as defense, international relations, trade and currency, and judicial and administrative law). The overseas collectivities are governed by local elected assemblies and by the French Parliament and [[Political system of France#Executive branch|French government]], with a [[French government ministers|cabinet member]], the [[Ministry of Overseas France|Minister of Overseas France]], in charge of issues related to the overseas territories. ([[New Caledonia]] is neither an overseas region nor an overseas collectivity; it has a ''sui generis'' status, in keeping with the [[Noum\u00e9a Accord]].)\n\nOverseas France covers a land area of {{convert|119396|km2|abbr=on}}{{efn|Excluding [[Ad\u00e9lie Land]].}} and accounts for 18.0% of the French Republic's land territory.<ref name=French_Republic>Land area of the four old overseas departments ([https://www.insee.fr/fr/statistiques/2864136#consulter]), Mayotte, the overseas collectivities, and New Caledonia ([https://www.insee.fr/fr/statistiques/fichier/2045658/my_oldcol_01.pdf page 21]), the French Southern and Antarctic Lands and the Scattered Islands ([http://observatoire-outre-mer.interieur.gouv.fr/site/layout/set/print/content/download/166/1067/file/Tdb_TAAF_Novembre17.pdf]), and Clipperton ([http://agriculture.gouv.fr/telecharger/44764?token=428075c480768259a6a7d05a971137ea]).</ref> It has an [[exclusive economic zone]] (EEZ) of {{convert|9825538|km2|abbr=on}} and accounts for 96.7% of the EEZ of the [[France|French Republic]]<ref name=\"searoundus\">{{cite web |url=http://www.seaaroundus.org/data/#/eez.aspx |title=Sea Around Us \u2013 Fisheries, Ecosystems and Biodiversity |publisher= |accessdate=2018-06-20}}</ref> (excluding the district of [[Ad\u00e9lie Land]], part of the [[French Southern and Antarctic Lands]], where the French sovereignty is effective ''de jure'' by French law, but where the French exclusive claim on this part of [[Antarctica]] is ''frozen'' by a mandatory international cooperation since the signing of the [[Antarctic Treaty]] in 1959).\n\n==Varying constitutional statuses==\n=== Overseas regions and departments ===\n{{Main|Overseas department and region}}\n\n{{Historical populations\n| 1953 | 909000 | 1963 | 1194000 | 1973 | 1475000 | 1983 | 1656000 | 1993 | 2028000 | 2003 | 2414000 | 2013 | 2691000 | 2018 | 2790000\n| footnote = The population of all five overseas departments totaled 2,169,000\n[https://www.insee.fr/fr/statistiques/1893198] in January 2018.

This halts their usually innate repulsive behavior to vertebrate odors and increases the chance that they will attempt to draw blood from a host.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Hansson BS, Stensmyr MC | title = Evolution of insect olfaction | journal = Neuron | volume = 72 | issue = 5 | pages = 698\u2013711 | date = December 2011 | pmid = 22153368 | doi = 10.1016/j.neuron.2011.11.003 | doi-access = free }}</ref> Because this is a change not in Or83b but in a population of olfactory sensory neurons, dispersing molecules to inhibit Or83b would not stop the behavior and a new strategy would have to develop.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Insect genes]]\n[[Category:Drosophila melanogaster genes]]\n[[Category:Olfactory receptors]]\n", "name_user": "2601:14f:8280:1300:7c46:14b:81b7:2f09", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eFunction)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Or83b_odorant_receptor"}

In 1897, Abner Weed bought the Siskiyou Lumber and Mercantile Mill and {{convert|280|acre|km2}} of land in what is now the City of Weed, for $400.<ref>\"Weed Now and Then\" http://www.snowcrest.net/whm/Weed1.html</ref> By the 1940s Weed boasted the world's largest sawmill.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\n===Boles Fire===\nOn September 15, 2014, the [[Boles Fire]] spread through the town, driven by 40-mph winds. The fire started behind the Boles Creek Apartments in the central part of Weed at approximately 1:30&nbsp;p.m., and within four hours quickly spread to over {{convert|200|acre}}. Evacuations were immediately ordered, and a shelter was first set up at [[College of the Siskiyous]], but as fire headed towards the college, the evacuation center was relocated first to the Siskiyou Golden Fairgrounds in [[Yreka, California|Yreka]], then to Yreka and Mount Shasta High Schools, then to the armory in [[Mount Shasta, California|Mt.

A large number of Italian immigrants migrated to Weed, and other towns in southern Siskiyou County at the turn of the 20th century. While immigrants were a source of labor for the region, they were not always well treated, in fact in 1909 complaints from workers in the lumber industry reached the Italian consul.<ref>Roediger, David R. \"Working Toward Whiteness\" p. 47</ref> However, in time the Italian population came to be a cornerstone of Weed civic life.  Many streets in the early Italian neighborhood bear names of Italian cities, such as Rome, Genoa, Como, and Venice. Annually since 1954, the town has held the Weed Italian Carnevale in June or July, although recently dropping \"Italian\" from its name while maintaining the Italian spelling of carnival and the traditional [[bocce]] ball tournaments.<ref>[http://www.weedchamber.com/chamber/carnevale.php] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080906132025/http://www.weedchamber.com/chamber/carnevale.php|date=September 6, 2008}}</ref>\n\nA large number of black-Americans migrated to Weed as well, to work in [[Long-Bell Lumber Company]]'s Weed facility after the company closed two mills in Louisiana in 1922.
